NOVELLA IJ.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Preface\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat Houses win and lose undying fame in a century. They shoot, bud,\r\nbloom, bear fruit;—from obscurity they rise to dominate their Age,\r\nindelibly to write their names in History: and, after a hundred years,\r\ngiving place to others who in turn shall take the stage, they descend\r\ninto the crowd, and live on, insignificant, retired, unknown.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, Caesars were masters of the world; and the genius of\r\nDivus Julius, of Divus Augustus, was worshipped everywhere on altars.\r\nThere are Cesarini at this day in Rome, _cosa grande ch’ il sole_,\r\nmasters of wide domains, but not of empires. Once upon time, Buonaparte\r\nheld Europe in its grip. Buonaparte at this day keeps exile in Muscovy\r\nor Flanders. Once upon a time, the Sforza were sovereigns-regnant; and\r\nof their daughters were made an empress and a queen. There are Sforza at\r\nthis day at Santafiora and at Rome; peers of princes only, not of kings.\r\nOnce upon a time, Borgia was supreme in Christendom. There are Borgia at\r\nthis day, peers of France; or patricians whose names are written in the\r\nGolden Book of Rome.\r\n\r\nIn little more than a century, from 1455 to 1572, Borgia sprang to the\r\npedestal of fame; leaping at a bound, from little bishoprics and\r\ncardinalates, to the terrible altitude of Peter’s Throne; producing, in\r\nthose few years, two Popes, and a Saint and General of Jesuits. It is\r\ntrue that there died, in the nineteenth century, another Borgia of\r\nrenown,—the Lord Stefano Borgia, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San\r\nClemente—a great and good man, admirable by Englishmen for a certain\r\ngracious deed which is not yet written in English History; and who\r\npreferred a second place to that giddy pre-eminence on which his kin\r\nformerly had played their part.\r\n\r\nThe history of the House of Borgia is the history of the healing of the\r\nGreat Schism; of the Renascence of letters and the arts; of the\r\nInvention of Printing; of the Muslim Invasion of Europe; of the\r\nconsolidation of that Pontifical Sovereignty which endured till 1870;\r\nthe history of the Discovery of a World; the history of the Discovery,\r\nby man, of Man.\r\n\r\n“To penetrate the abyss of any human personality is impossible. No man\r\ntruly sees his living neighbour’s, brother’s, wife’s,—nay, even his own,\r\nsoul.” (_John Addington Symonds._) Much more obscure must be his\r\nfriend’s; and darker still, his enemy’s;—and these alive. What, then,\r\ncan be known of personalities, who are but distant, perhaps\r\nuninteresting, mere names?\r\n\r\nChronicles there are, and chroniclers; and no more reliance can be\r\nplaced in those, than in modern morning and evening newspapers. The same\r\ndefect is common to both,—the personal equation, the human nature of the\r\nwriter, historian, journalist.\r\n\r\nCardinal Bartolomeo Sacchi (detto Platina) was “a heathen, and a bad\r\none.” He had to stand his trial on a charge of worshipping false gods,\r\nwas acquitted for want of evidence, and departed this life in the Odour\r\nof Sanctity. Modern discoveries, in the secret recesses of the\r\ncatacombs, have proved that he was used to carry on his nefarious\r\npractices there, with a handful of other extravagant athenians of like\r\nkidney. He wrote a History of the Popes, which fairly deserves to be\r\ncalled veracious: but he had a personal grudge against the Lord Paul\r\nP.P. II. Who had put him to trial for paganism and grieved him with the\r\ntorture called The Question; wherefore, he got even with His Holiness\r\nwhen he wrote His life, and a more singular example of truth untruly\r\ntold would be hard to find. Platina died in the reign of the Lord Xystus\r\nP.P. IV; and his History of the Popes was continued by Onofrio Panvinii,\r\nwho, according to Sir Paul Rycaut, gravely states that, in 1489, the\r\nLord Innocent P.P. VIII permitted mass to be said without wine, in\r\nNorway; because, that country being cold and the distance far, the wine\r\neither was frozen, or was turned to vinegar, before it could be brought\r\nthither. Obviously, Platina and Panvinii require credible corroboration.\r\n\r\nMesser Stefano Infessura lays himself open to suspicion, as to his bona\r\nfides and as to his knowledge, by his remarks on the Lord Xystus P.P.\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nMonsignor Hans Burchard, whose original Diarium awaits discovery, is\r\ncareless, Teutonic, and petty.\r\n\r\nThe Orators of the Powers compile their state-dispatches from what they\r\nhave picked up when hanging about the doors of palaces, or from the\r\nobservations of bribed flunkeys.\r\n\r\nMesser Paolo Giovio, preconised Bishop of Nocera by the Lord Clement\r\nP.P. VII, Messer Francesco Guicciardini, and Messer Benedetto Varchi,\r\nwere Florentines, who wrote in the Florentine manner, of Rome and Roman\r\naffairs, from an antipathetic point of view, and solely on the gossip\r\nand tittle-tattle that filtered through to Florence after long years.\r\nYet they wrote in stately delicate language, “Dante’s desiderata,—that\r\nillustrious cardinal courtly curial mother-tongue, proper to each\r\nItalian state, special to none, whereby the local idioms of every city\r\nare to be measured, weighed, compared.” Only—only—the student of their\r\nwork must know that, (in common with all professional manufacturers of\r\nsquibs, libels, and lampoons, in every age,) what they liked they\r\npraised; and what they loathed they rhetorically and categorically\r\ndamned, compiling concise catalogues of all the worst crimes known to\r\ncasuistry, to lay at their foe’s door. Therefore, the student of history\r\nmust learn the personal sympathies and antipathies of these historians;\r\nhe must find their personal equation: and, when he has deducted that, he\r\nmay arrive at least in juxtaposition with truth. This method has been\r\nattempted in the present work—in the absence of impersonal authorities.\r\n\r\n_Mi sembra che la storia si sia servita della famiglia Borgia come di\r\ntela sopra la quale abbia voluto dipingere le sfenatezze dei secoli XV,\r\nXVI._ “It appears to me that history has made the House of Borgia to\r\nserve as a canvas whereon to depict the unbridled licence of the\r\nFifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries.” (_Ragguali, sulla vita di Marino\r\nSanuto, 207, note._) By some historians, the Borgia women are delineated\r\nas “poison-bearing maenads,” or “veneficous bacchantes”; the Borgia men\r\nas monsters utterly flagitious: both men and women of a wickedness\r\nperfectly impossible to human nature, perfectly improbable even in\r\nnature kakodaimoniacal. By other historians, chiefly, strange to say, of\r\nthe French School, and afflicted with the modern itch for\r\nrehabilitation, the identical Borgia are displayed in the character of\r\nstainless innocents who shine in the light of inconceivable virtue.\r\n\r\nNo man, save One, since Adam, has been wholly good. Not one has been\r\nwholly bad. The truth about the Borgia, no doubt, lies between the two\r\nextremes. They are accused of loose morals, and of having been addicted\r\nto improper practices and amusements.\r\n\r\nWell; what then? Does anybody want to judge them? Popes, and kings, and\r\nlovers, and men of intellect, and men of war cannot be judged by the\r\nnarrow code, the stunted standard, of the journalist and the\r\nlodging-house keeper, or the plumber and the haberdasher. So indecently\r\nunjust a suggestion only could emanate from persons who expect to gain\r\nin comparison.\r\n\r\nWhy should good hours of sunlight be wasted on the judgment seat, by\r\nthose who, presently, will have to take their turn in the dock? Why not\r\nleave the affairs of Borgia to the Recording Angel?\r\n\r\nAll about the Borgia quite truly will be known, some day; and, in the\r\ninterim, more profitable entertainment may be gained by frankly and\r\nopenly studying that swift vivid violent age, when “the Pope was an\r\nItalian Despot with sundry sacerdotal additions;” when “what Mill, in\r\nhis Essay on Liberty, desired,—what seems every day more unattainable in\r\nmodern life,—was enjoyed by the Italians; _there was no check to the\r\ngrowth of personality, no grinding of men down to match the average_.”\r\n\r\n    “Amorist, agonist, man, that, incessantly toiling and striving,\r\n    “Snatches the glory of life only from love and from war—\r\n\r\nthat is the formula in which the Borgia best may find expression. For\r\nthey, also, were human beings, who were born, struggled through life,\r\nand died.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this Ideal Content of the House of Borgia, there is matter for a\r\nscore of specialists. The present writer lays no claim to any special\r\nknowledge whatever; although his studies obviously have led him more in\r\none direction than in another. Curbed by his limitations, he makes no\r\npretensions to the discovery of new or striking facts: but he humbly\r\ntrusts that he has been enabled to throw new and natural light on myths\r\nand legends, and to re-arrange causes and events in a humanly probable\r\nsequence.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with circumstantial calumny, he has adopted an unworn system;\r\n_e.g._, in the case of persons said to have been raised to the purple in\r\nreward for criminal services. Here, he furnishes complete lists of the\r\npersons raised to the purple; and, when the names of those accused of\r\ncrime do not appear therein, he takes the fact as direct and positive\r\nrefutation of the calumny.\r\n\r\nTouching the matter of names and styles, he has made an attempt to\r\ncorrect the slipshod and corrupt translations of the same, which, at\r\npresent, are the vogue. To allude to Personages in terms which are\r\nappropriate enough for one’s terrier, or for one’s slave; to speak of\r\nsovereigns as mere John, or of pontiffs as plain Paul; are breaches of\r\netiquette of unpardonable grossness. The present writer has tried, at\r\nleast, to accord to his characters the use of the names, and the\r\ncourtesy of the styles that they actually bore.\r\n\r\nIn his manner of writing, he has endeavoured to rush from mood to mood,\r\nin consonance with the subject under consideration, with something of\r\nthe flippant breathless masterful versatility which Nature uses. For men\r\nwere very natural in the Borgian Era.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the style of a history should be grave and stately; and\r\nso it should be, when History is written in epic form. But to write of\r\nmen and women,—human men and women,—on those inhuman lines, is nothing\r\nbut an unnatural crime; and, also, as ridiculously incongruous and\r\ninconsistent, as it would be to sing the _Miserere mei Deus_ to the tune\r\nof the _Marseillaise_. For human nature is not at all times grave and\r\nstately; but has its dressing-gown-and-slipper periods,—being human\r\nnature. The aim of this work is to display the Borgia alive and\r\npicturesque and unconventional, as indeed they were; not monumentally to\r\nfreeze them into ideally heroic moulds, or to chisel them into\r\nconventionally unrecognisable effigies.\r\n\r\nThe writer does not write with the simple object of “white-washing” the\r\nHouse of Borgia; his present opinion being that all men are too vile for\r\nwords to tell.\r\n\r\nFurther, he does not write in the Roman Catholic interest; nor in the\r\nJesuit interest; nor in the interest of any creed, or corporation, or\r\neven human being: but solely as one who has scratched together some\r\nsherds of knowledge, which he perforce must sell, to live.\r\n\r\nIt should be unnecessary to say that no persuasion of, and no offence\r\nto, any man, or any school of thought, is intended in these pages; and\r\nthat the writer, in the absence of desired advice, has written what he\r\nhas written under correction.\r\n\r\nHe returns thanks to the officers of the Oxford University Galleries, of\r\nthe Bodleian Library, and of the British Museum, for courteous and\r\nvaluable assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The following works have been studied for the purpose of this history;\r\nand thanks are due to the authors for copious extracts made therefrom_;\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ambrogini.

The Muslim Infidel swarmed from the dark Orient, sworn to plant the\r\nCrescent on the ruin of the Cross. In resisting encroachment, King\r\nWladislaw of Hungary and the Apostolic Legate, the Most Illustrious[1]\r\nLord Giuliano Cesarini, Cardinal-Bishop of Tusculum, a Roman of Rome,\r\nand scion of a most splendid family,[2] had laid down life at the Battle\r\nof Varna. After three and fifty days of siege, Constantinople fell to\r\nthe Great Turk, the Sultàn Muhammed II. Ioannes Palaiologos, “King and\r\nAutocrat of the Romans,” was dead; and his successor Konstantinos\r\nDragases XIII, the last Christian Emperor of the East, was slain in\r\ndefence of his capital. By the fall of the great Byzantine Empire, the\r\nbulwarks of Christendom were broken down; the Infidel was raiding on her\r\nborders. Alone, with no ally, Jan Hunniades desperately defended\r\nHungary’s frontier. The Powers of Europe occupied themselves with less\r\nimportant matters.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Rome was the eye, and the brain, of the world; and Rome\r\nhad seen and realised all that was portended.\r\n\r\nDuring many years, since the first signs of Muslim activity, fugitives\r\nfrom Byzantium descended upon Italian shores. The glory of Greece had\r\ngone to Imperial Rome. The grandeur of Imperial Rome had returned to\r\nByzantium. And now the glory and grandeur of Byzantium was going to\r\nChristian Rome. When danger menaced, when the day of stress began to\r\ndawn, scholars and cunning artificers, experts skilful in all knowledge,\r\nfled westward to the open arms of Italy with their treasures of work.\r\nItaly welcomed all who could enlarge, illuminate, her transcendent\r\ngenius; learning and culture and skill found with her not exile but a\r\nhome, and a market for wares. Scholarship became the fashion. “Literary\r\ntaste was the regulative principle.” It was the Age of Acquisition.\r\n“Tuscan is hardly known to all Italians, but Latin is spread far and\r\nwide throughout the world”; said Filelfo. But to know Greek was the real\r\ntest of a gentleman of that day; and Greek scholars were Italy’s most\r\nhonoured guests. Not content with the codices and classics of antiquity\r\nthat these brought with them, Italian princes and patricians sent\r\nembassies to falling Byzantium, to search for manuscripts, inscriptions,\r\nor carven gems, and bronze, and marble. Greek intaglii and camei graced\r\nthe finger-rings, the ouches, collars, caps, of Venetian senators, of\r\nthe lords of Florence, of the sovereigns of the Regno,[3] of the barons\r\nand cardinals and popes of Rome. “They had made the discovery that the\r\nbody of a man is a miracle of beauty, each limb a divine wonder, each\r\nmuscle a joy as great as sight of stars or flowers.” Messer Filippo\r\nBrunelleschi, who truly said that his figure of Christ was a crucified\r\ncontadino, erected the marvellous dome of Florence. For the Lord\r\nEugenius P.P. IV, Messer Antonio Filarete carved the Rapes of Leda and\r\nGanumedes on the great bronze gates of St. Peter’s. Messer Lorenzo\r\nGhiberti modelled the marvellous doors of the Baptistery. Messer Simone\r\nFiorentino (detto Donatello) placed, on the north wall of Orsanmichele,\r\nhis superb St. George in marble; and cast in bronze for Duke Cosmo the\r\nnitid David of the Bargello. Tommaso di Ser Giovanni degli Scheggia,\r\ncalled Masaccio (great hulking Tom), painted St. Peter and St. Paul\r\nraising the dead, with the skill which he learned from Tommaso di\r\nCristoforo Fini, called Masolino (pretty little Tom). Paolo Doni,\r\nnicknamed Uccello (Bird), put birds into his pictures according to his\r\nwont. The Blessed Giovangelico da Fiesole filled triptychs with his\r\nvisions of the angelic hierarchy. Fra Filippo Lippi painted the St.\r\nGabriel Archangel with the argus-eyed wings in an admirable\r\nAnnunciation. Petrarch and Boccaccio hunted convents, abbeys, and\r\nmuseums, of Byzantium for codices. Messer Poggio Bracciolini discovered\r\nmanuscripts of Lucretius Carus, of Vitruvius, of Quinctillian, and\r\nCicero’s Oration _For Caecina_. “No severity of winter cold, no snow, no\r\nlength of journey, no roughness of road, prevented him from bringing the\r\nmonuments of antiquity to light,” says Francesco Barbaro. Nor did he\r\nhesitate to steal, when theft seemed necessary to secure a precious\r\ncodex. Three pupils of Manuel Chrysoloras won renown beyond all\r\ncompetitors in the distinguished race: Giovanni Aurispa collected no\r\nfewer than two hundred and thirty eight valuable manuscripts of\r\nantiquity; Guarino da Verona and Francesco Filelfo came back laden from\r\nByzantium.\r\n\r\nDrunk with the joy of the new learning, Italy failed to perceive the\r\ntrue inwardness of her acquisitions. She was blind to the peril which\r\nthey most surely portended.\r\n\r\nBut Rome saw. And, during many years, Rome had lifted up her voice and\r\ncried aloud that Italy enjoyed these accessions to her treasure only\r\nbecause Byzantium was no longer a safe repository for them. During many\r\ndecades, Rome proclaimed the danger implied by the advance of the Muslim\r\nInfidel. But Christendom lent deaf ears, and compared Rome to Kassandra.\r\nThen Immortal Rome was lulled into a kind of apathy: her voice was heard\r\nless frequently, speaking in feebler, in less insistent tone. And,\r\ngradually, the potent spell of the Renascence mastered Rome; and, in the\r\nreign of the Lord Nicholas P.P. V.[4] she fell a victim to the\r\nfashionable delirium. Churches and palaces were planned, and builded,\r\nand decorated. Manuscripts were collected, collated, copied. Libraries\r\nand colleges were formed. Culture, at last, and for once, was supreme;\r\nand the phenomenon of needy genius was unknown. It was an age when the\r\ndemand for learning, and for the fine arts, exceeded the supply.\r\n\r\nThen, Rome knew that the beautiful may be purchased at too dear a price;\r\nthat its essential evanescence needs the safeguard of virtue and of\r\nheroism, of honour and of arms; precisely as woman needs the protection\r\nof man. Rome perceived that the irruption of the Muslim Infidel was a\r\nmenace to civilisation, and she cried on Christendom to resist the flood\r\nof barbarism now outpoured.\r\n\r\nHungary, alone of all the Occidental Powers, responded; but then Hungary\r\nwas actually in the Muslim clutch.\r\n\r\nEngland, lately torn by Jack Cade’s rebellion, was entering upon a\r\nconflict bloodier than any American Civil War or Boer Revolt. The reign\r\nof King Henry VI. Plantagenet, gentlest saint that ever wore an earthly\r\ndiadem, drew near its close: from those pale prayer-raised hands—holy\r\nhands that had lifted to Christ’s Vicar a petition for the canonisation\r\nof England’s Hero, King Ælfred the Great[5]—the sceptre was about to\r\nfall. Trumpets were sounding from Northumberland to Kent. The clean air\r\nof Yorkshire wolds sang with the hissing of cloth-yard shafts, with the\r\nclang of steel of lance on shield. England was an armed camp; and the\r\nWar of the Roses was begun.\r\n\r\nGermany and Austria, under the rule of the Holy Roman Emperor, “Caesar\r\nSemper Augustus” Friedrich IV (The Pacific), seethed with\r\npolitico-religious discontent. Under the guise of a desire for reform,\r\npolitical and personal ambitions strove. Caesar Friedrich IV held the\r\nreins of government but loosely. Excellent as a figure-head, ornamental\r\nas an emperor, he had not his empire in the grip of a _mailed fist_. The\r\nsymbol A.E.I.O.U. (AUSTRIAE EST IMPERATOR ORBIS UNIVERSI—ALLE ERDE IST\r\nOESTERREICHS UNTERTHAN), which he had invented for his motto,\r\nrepresented his desire, but not his potentiality. Personal\r\naggrandisement employed the feudal sovereigns of the empire: their\r\nsuzerain’s influence was no check upon them.\r\n\r\nItaly, then, deserved the designation given to it in modern times by\r\nMetternich; it was not a nation, but a geographical expression. In the\r\nnorth were the Republics of Venice, Genoa, Florence, and their smaller\r\nimitators; with the royal duchies of Savoja, Milan, and Ferrara. Across\r\nthe country, from Rome and the Mediterranean, to the Mark of Ancona and\r\nthe Adriatic, in a north-easterly direction, stretched the Papal States.\r\nThe east and south, with Sicily, Sardinia, and the Islands, were called\r\nThe Regno; and were ruled from Naples by kings of the House of Aragon.\r\nAnd dotted all over the land were small semi-independent cities and\r\nterritories, held as feudal fiefs by local noble houses, whose barons\r\nbore the harmless title of Tyrant, and exercised absolute lordship\r\nwithin their little states, _e.g._, the Manfredi, Tyrants of Faenza; the\r\nMalatesta, Tyrants of Rimini; the Sforza, Tyrants of Pesaro,\r\nChotignuola, Santafiora, Imola and Forli; etc.\r\n\r\nFrance, having burned her greatest glory, The Maid of Orleans, was\r\nrecovering from victories by which, from 1434 to 1450, she had deprived\r\nEngland of all French territory save Calais. Her feeble dastard King\r\nCharles VII. was dead; and Louis XI., a gentleman of pleasure and piety,\r\noccupied her throne.\r\n\r\nSpain, united, after centuries of strife among her divers kingdoms and\r\nantagonistic races, by the marriage of King Don Hernando of Aragon to\r\nQueen Doña Isabella of Castile, was preparing for an era of colonial\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\nPortugal was consolidating African discoveries and acquisitions.\r\n\r\nNorway and Sweden, after brief separation, once more were united under\r\nthe sceptre of Denmark; and were learning the lessons of peace.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in Rome, in 1455, on the 24th of March, being Monday in\r\nPassion-week, the Lord Nicholas P.P. V was dead: and, with His death,\r\nthe tide of the Italian Renascence stayed.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe College of Cardinals assumed the government of Rome and of the\r\nUniversal Church, while the Conclave for the election of the Successor\r\nof St. Peter was assembling. During nine days the Novendialia, the\r\nquaint ceremonies connected with the obsequies of a Pope, were\r\ncelebrated. On Good Friday, the 4th of April, after the Adoration of the\r\nCross, the Mass of the Presanctified, and the Exposition of the Vernicle\r\n(or True Image of our Divine Redeemer, vulgarly known as The Veronica),\r\nhad been performed in the Vatican Basilica, the cardinals were immured;\r\nthe doors and windows of the Vatican were bricked up; Pandolfo, Prince\r\nSavelli, Hereditary Marshal of the Holy Roman Church, entered upon the\r\nguardianship of the Conclave; and the election was begun.\r\n\r\nThe College of Cardinals consisted then of twenty members. Of these,\r\nonly fifteen assisted at the Conclave of 1455. In the fifteenth century,\r\na journey across Europe, from some distant see, occupied a longer time\r\nthan the eleven days which should elapse between a Pope’s death and the\r\nenclosure of the Conclave. Of these fifteen cardinals present, seven\r\nwere Italians, four Spaniards, two Frenchmen, two Byzantines. As usual\r\nthey were divided into factions; but, strange to say, the division was\r\nnot one of nationality. The ancient and interminable feud between the\r\ngreat Roman baronial houses of Colonna and Orsini, penetrated even here.\r\nNot temporal policy of the Holy See, not differences of pious opinions,\r\nbut simply rivalry of clan, governed this election.\r\n\r\nThe Most Illustrious Lord Prospero Colonna, Cardinal-Archdeacon of San\r\nGiorgio _in Velum Aureum_, creature (_creatura_) of the Lord Martin P.P.\r\nIII, undoubtedly would have been elected had the Lord Nicholas P.P. V\r\ndied at the beginning instead of at the end of a long illness: for,\r\naccording to the dispatch of Nicholas of Pontremoli, Orator of Duke\r\nFrancesco Sforza-Visconti of Milan, dated the first of April, 1455, he\r\nwas then the favourite. Herr Ludwig Pastor, whose valuable history of\r\nthe Popes is also the latest, most unaccountably urges that the great\r\nage of Cardinal Colonna prevented his election. But the accurate\r\nCiacconi raises him to the purple with Cardinal Capranica at the Lord\r\nMartin P.P. III’s fourth creation in 1426, he being then still a youth\r\n(“_adhuc iuvenis_”); the publication of his elevation being delayed till\r\nthe fifth consistory of the 8th of November 1430. Supposing him to have\r\nbeen of the age of twenty-one years in 1426—a very liberal assumption in\r\nan age when boys became cardinals at thirteen, benedicks at puberty, and\r\nfathers at fifteen—he only would have reached the age of fifty in 1455.\r\nThe disability of senility may therefore be dismissed. In default of\r\nCardinal Prospero, the Most Illustrious Lord Domenico Capranica,\r\nCardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Croce _in Gerusalemme_,\r\nCardinal-Penitentiary, Bishop of Fermo, and himself a Roman noble of the\r\nGhibelline party, was put forward by the House of Colonna as their\r\nsecond candidate.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the wealthy business-like Roman Guelf, the Lord\r\nLatino Orsini di Bari, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San Giovanni e\r\nSan Paolo _in Monte Celio_, represented the interests of the House of\r\nOrsini: who offered, as an alternative for the suffrages of the Sacred\r\nCollege, the Venetian Lord Pietro Barbo, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title\r\nof San Marco, and Bishop of Vicenza.\r\n\r\nThe first three scrutinies produced no result; and the cardinals\r\nconferred regarding the merits of the candidates, and of the causes that\r\nthey represented. Much was said on behalf of Cardinal Capranica. He was\r\n“Romano di Roma,” his character stood above reproach, his breeding was\r\npolite and high. But Cardinal Orsini and his faction, though unable to\r\nbring in their own nominee the Cardinal of Venice, were strong enough to\r\nout-manœuver the candidate of Colonna: and the electors found themselves\r\nat a deadlock.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency, the College, sought, and found, a neutral; a partizan\r\nneither of Colonna nor of Orsini. There were two Byzantine cardinals;\r\nthe one, the Lord Ioannes Bessarione, Cardinal-Bishop of Tusculum, Monk\r\nof the Religion[6] of St. Basil, Archbishop of Trebizond; the other, the\r\nLord Isidoro of Thessalonika, Cardinal-Bishop of Sabina, Monk of the\r\nReligion of St. Basil, Archbishop of Ruthenia. Of these two, Cardinal\r\nBessarione had many recommendations. He was a convert from the Greek\r\nSchism; he had been a pupil of Gemisthos Plethon at Constantinople; no\r\none was of higher repute in Christian piety, more admirable in doctrine,\r\nmore ornate in generous manners. (Ciacconi II. 906.) He had no enemy in\r\nthe Conclave. At a juncture, like the present, the election of a\r\nByzantine Pontiff, who naturally sympathised with the hapless\r\nByzantines, would have secured for Christendom a champion against the\r\ntriumphant Muslim Infidel. When night closed the Conclave’s\r\ndeliberations, it appeared certain that Cardinal Bessarione would ascend\r\nthe Throne of St. Peter on the morrow; indeed his brother-cardinals\r\nasked favours of him, as though he were already in possession of the\r\nKeys. Had he condescended to canvass the other fourteen electors, or to\r\nmake the slightest exertion on his own behalf, his election would have\r\nbeen secure.\r\n\r\nBut, in the morning of that Easter Monday, the French Archbishop of\r\nAvignon, the Lord Alain Coëtivy Britto, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title\r\nof Santa Prassede, created a diversion against Cardinal Bessarione.\r\n“Shall we Latins,” he protested, “shall we Latins go to Greece for the\r\nHead of the Latin Church? My Lord of Trebizond has not been among us\r\nlong enough to shave off his beard[7]; he is a mere neophyte, a newcomer\r\nto Italy and to the Holy Roman Church, and shall we set him over us?”\r\nAll day long the cardinals debated; but no election was achieved. Night\r\ncame, bringing no solution of the difficulty.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of April a compromise was suggested. It was resolved to\r\npostpone the contest, by electing an old man whose life was almost at an\r\nend. Therefore a cardinal was chosen, whose age, in the course of\r\nnature, would cause a new election in the near future; whose colourless\r\ncharacter neither would alter nor interfere with the traditional policy\r\nof the papacy; who during a long life had eschewed pomp and vain glory;\r\nwhose profound learning, wisdom, and moderation had won for him his high\r\nplace; whose reputation was blameless; whose political capacity was\r\nhigh; who was the intimate of the friend and neighbour of Holy Church,\r\nDon Alonso de Aragona, King of Naples; lastly, one who, being of the\r\nSpanish race, was the hereditary foe of Islam, and pre-eminently\r\nqualified to defend Christendom from the Muslim Infidel. The aforesaid\r\nCardinal of Avignon, and the Lord Ludovico Scarampi dell’ Arena\r\nMezzaruota, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San Lorenzo _in Damaso_,\r\nexerted all their influence to this end; and, after a new scrutiny, the\r\nCardinal-Dean, the Lord Giorgio Flisco de Savignana, Cardinal-Bishop of\r\nOstia and Velletri, made proclamation of election,\r\n\r\n“I announce to you great joy. We have for a Pope the Lord Alonso de\r\nBorja, Bishop of Valencia, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santi\r\nQuattro Coronati, Who wills to be called Calixtus the Third.”[8]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Spanish House of Borja claims to originate in King Don Ramiro\r\nSanchez de Aragona, A.D. 1035.\r\n\r\nUntil the time of Don Pedro, Count of Aybar and Lord of Borja, who died\r\nin 1152, the family was confined to Spain. Then, according to valid\r\nauthorities, the Junior Branch, in the person of Don Ricardo de Borja,\r\nmigrated to the kingdom of Naples and the Two Sicilies, and took service\r\nthere. This Don Ricardo is named in a document of donation in the reign\r\nof the Lord Lucius P.P. III, 1181–1185 (Ricchi); which should go to\r\nprove that the Junior Branch was naturalised in Italy. Its lineal\r\ndescendants undoubtedly are living there at the beginning of the\r\ntwentieth century; the latest recorded being Don Alessandro Borgia, who\r\nwas born at Milan in 1897. For purposes of clear arrangement, the\r\nhistory of this Junior Branch may be relegated to later pages; the main\r\ninterest lies in descendants of Don Ximenes Garcia de Borja, the eldest\r\nson of the aforesaid Don Pedro, and founder of the Senior Branch; which,\r\nthough transplanted to Italy in the middle of the fifteenth century, and\r\nflourishing there for some generations, must always be regarded as\r\nSpanish and not Italian.\r\n\r\nThere is record of a son of Don Ximenes Garcia de Borja in 1244, called\r\nGonzales Gil: his son, Don Raymon de Borja, was the father of Don Juan\r\nDomingo de Borja, Lord of La Torre de Canals in the city of Xativa in\r\nValencia. By his wife, Doña Francisca, this Don Juan Domingo had at\r\nleast two daughters and a son—Juana, Caterina, and Alonso.\r\n\r\nDoña Juana married Don Jofre de Lançol; Doña Caterina married Don Juan\r\nde Mila, Baron of Mazalanes; a third daughter, whose name is missing,\r\nalso married; and the offspring of these three became later of extreme\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe son, Alonso, was born on St. Sylvester’s Eve, 1378, the year of the\r\nopening of the Great Schism, at Xativa, and baptized in the church of\r\nSt. Mary in that city. He himself has told us this, in two Bulls dated\r\n1457.[9] His youth was spent at the University of Lerida, where he\r\nspecialised in jurisprudence for the degree of Doctor in Civil and Canon\r\nLaw, and obtained a professorship and Holy Order. While he was a young\r\npriest (1398–1408) he chanced to assist at a sermon preached by the\r\ngreat Dominican Vincent Ferrer in a mission at Valencia. At the close of\r\nhis discourse, the friar singled out from the crowd Don Alonso de Borja,\r\nto whom he addressed this remarkable prediction: “My son, you one day\r\nwill be called to be the ornament of your house and of your country. You\r\nwill be invested with the highest dignity that can fall to the lot of\r\nman. After my death, I shall be the object of your special honour.\r\nEndeavour to persevere in a life of virtue.” Don Alonso was impressed by\r\nthis saying, for he repeated it to St. John Capistran in 1449, and he\r\ntenaciously waited for the fulfilment. After His election to the papacy,\r\nHe performed the solemn canonisation of St. Vincent Ferrer on the\r\ntwenty-ninth of June, 1455.\r\n\r\nDon Alonso proceeded from his University professorship to a canonry in\r\nthe cathedral of Lerida, which was conferred upon him by his countryman\r\nDon Pedro de Luna, the Pseudopontiff Benedict XIII. Later, he entered\r\nthe arena of politics as secretary to King Don Alonso I (The\r\nMagnanimous) of Naples and the Two Sicilies; and, here, his diplomatic\r\nskill and legal training raised him to the unofficial but important post\r\nof confidential counsellor to the Majesty of the Regno. Now that he was\r\ndomiciled in Italy his fortunes moved swiftly. In 1429 he won the\r\ngratitude of the Lord Martin P.P. III (or V) by winning for His Holiness\r\nthe support of Spain, and by negotiating the renunciation of the Spanish\r\nPseudopontiff, Don Gil Muñoz, who called himself Clement VIII.\r\n\r\nThese days of the Great Schism, when the Roman Pontiffs had much ado to\r\nhold Their Own against irregularly elected pseudopontiffs, must have\r\nbeen utterly horrible. A reigning sovereign is uneasy when pretenders\r\nto, or usurpers of, his crown appear. Republican France farcically\r\nbanishes men whose nobler forefathers represented other forms of\r\ngovernment. England sometimes wakes prodigally to spend blood and\r\ntreasure in support of her suzerainty. If secular powers, then, strive,\r\nstruggle for their life; and, in the struggle, cause distress, how many\r\ntimes more distressing must have been the rivalry of the Great Schism,\r\nwhen the prize at stake was the Headship of Christendom. This\r\nconsideration will make it easy to understand how great an obligation\r\nthe Lord Martin P.P. III lay under to the skilful canon, who actually\r\npersuaded His rival peaceably to renounce his claim to the triple crown,\r\nterminating the thirty-eighth schism of the Holy Roman Church. As a\r\nreward, Canon Alonso de Borja received the bishopric of Valencia, his\r\nnative diocese; and, after his consecration, he continued to be useful\r\nto King Don Alonso de Aragona, by re-organising the government of the\r\nRegno, and by supervising the education of the King’s Bastard and\r\nsubsequent successor, Don Ferrando.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were not more filled with\r\nimprobable situations than the twentieth. The situations were different,\r\nthat is all. The situation of bastards was quite curious, and must be\r\nrealised by any one who desires intelligently to understand the time. To\r\nthis intelligent understanding Ludovico Romano’s theories will lend aid.\r\nHe argues that it is false to say that bastards are infamous and\r\nincapable of honours. To the infamous is denied the dignity of Decurion\r\n(command of ten men). But bastards may become Decuriones. Therefore\r\nbastards are neither infamous nor incapable of honour. Giampietro de\r\nCrescenzi Romani, in _Il Nobile Romano_, states the case thus: Plebeians\r\nare not eligible to the Decurionate. Bastards are eligible to the\r\nDecurionate. Therefore, bastards are not plebeians, but nobles if born\r\nof noble stock. Bastards are capable of nobility, of secular and civil\r\ndignity; for Ishmael was not hunted from his father’s house on account\r\nof his bastardy, but on account of his insolence. It is not necessary to\r\nquote Crescenzi’s argument as to the bastards of King David, from whom\r\ndescends the Son of David, Son of Abraham, according to the Scripture,\r\nand Whom the Fathers of the Church acclaim as One of royal generation;\r\nnor to give more of his catalogue of noble bastards than Theodoric, King\r\nof the Goths of Italy and of Spain, the Emperor Charlemagne, Roberto and\r\nPandolfo Malatesta, Tyrants of Rimini, Giovanni Sforza, Tyrant of\r\nPesaro, William (called The Conqueror), Duke of Normandy and King of\r\nEngland. He continues to say that nature does not distinguish between\r\nbastards and legitimates; that the former are called natural children\r\nbecause they are true children of nature. Neither does grace\r\ndistinguish; and, as bastards are capable of temporal nobility, so also\r\nthey are capable of spiritual, as witness St. Bridget of Ireland, and\r\nother natural children of signal grace and distinguished virtue.\r\nFurther, he holds that the sons, of bastards who lose nobility by\r\nrebellion, are not infamous; and recover nobility on their father’s\r\ndeath; that infamy of any kind is washed-out by baptism: and that the\r\nPope can free from subsequently contracted infamy by His dispensation.\r\nHe distinguishes between bastards only legitimated by princes or the\r\nemperor, who are ineligible to ecclesiastical benefices; and bastards\r\nlegitimated only by the Pope, who cannot succeed to the fiefs of other\r\nprinces. He concludes that bastardy purges itself at the latest in the\r\nfourth generation.\r\n\r\nIn the twentieth century, an inheritance devolves from the holder to\r\n“the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten”; in the fifteenth, the\r\nproviso “lawfully begotten” did not invariably obtain. A bastard,\r\nlegitimated and recognised by his father, was as valid and capable as\r\nthe son of a lawful marriage. The sin of the father and mother was a sin\r\npersonal to them, and none the less a Sin: but it was not allowed to\r\naffect their innocent children. The Lord Pius P.P. II, on his way to the\r\nCongress of Mantua in 1459, was met on the frontier of Ferrara by eight\r\nbastards of the royal House of Este, including the delicious Borso,\r\nreigning duke, and two bastards of his highness’s bastard brother and\r\npredecessor Duke Leonello. These matters should be understood; for a\r\nlarge proportion of the personages in this history were of illegitimate\r\nbirth, and under no disability of any kind thereby.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKing Don Alonso I de Aragona did not feel safe with the crown of the\r\nRegno which he wore. The House of Anjou claimed it. Madame Marguerite\r\nd’Anjou, daughter of the poet-king Réné, had ceded or sold her rights to\r\nthe Christian King Louis XI of France, whose claim was supported by the\r\nLord Martin P.P. III. The Magnanimous King Don Alonso I threatened to\r\nespouse the cause and benefit by the aid of the Pseudopontiff (called\r\nClement VIII); and so the materials for a devastating conflagration were\r\nbrought together. But the diplomacy of Bishop Alonso de Borja was\r\nrepeated here. Once again, by negotiating the peaceful disappearance of\r\na pseudopontiff, he earned the gratitude of the Pope; and the Lord\r\nMartin P.P. III, Who owed so much to Bishop Alonso, was easily persuaded\r\nto look favourably also upon Bishop Alonso’s royal master. Unfortunately\r\nthe Pope died, and His Successor, the Lord Eugenius P.P. IV had a\r\nprejudice for the French claim, which resulted in a renewal of the\r\nquarrel in 1439. But a third time the difficulties of the Roman Pontiff\r\nwere turned to account by Bishop Alonso. When the schismatic Synod of\r\nBasilea, to gain some private ends, futilely pronounced a sentence of\r\nexcommunication and deposition upon the Lord Eugenius P.P. IV, and\r\nelected the ambitious Duke Amadeo of Savoja as Pseudopontiff with the\r\nname Felix V, all Christendom expected that King Don Alonso, who was a\r\nvery crafty potentate, would be only too happy to make common cause with\r\nthe rival of that Pope who would not confirm his crown to him. But all\r\nChristendom was disappointed. King Don Alonso’s secretary ably manœuvred\r\nin his accustomed manner. First, Bishop Alonso de Borja in his proper\r\nperson refused to attend that schismatic Synod of Basilea; and, by this\r\nact, became persona gratissima at the Vatican. Second, the King of\r\nNaples instructed his Orators (ambassadors) to play with Pontiff and\r\npseudopontiff, to find out which would meet him with a satisfactory\r\nconcession. Third, Don Francesco Sforza-Visconti, Duke of Milan, began\r\nto harass the Lord Eugenius P.P. IV. And, then, the Pope agreed to\r\nreceive an embassage from the King of Naples, and to hear his cause\r\npleaded by Bishop Alonso de Borja.\r\n\r\nThis was the cause of King Don Alonso. A bastard of the House of Aragon,\r\nhe had been adopted by Queen Doña Juana of Naples, who lacked a lineal\r\nheir, in 1420. He was acknowledged by the people as sovereign of the\r\nRegno, and was actually in possession of the crown.\r\n\r\nThe Christian King Louis XI. also claimed to have been adopted by Queen\r\nDoña Juana: but he never had been acknowledged, nor ever had possessed\r\nthe crown.\r\n\r\nThen there was the matter of King Don Alonso’s bastard, Don Ferrando.\r\nThe childless Queen believed him to be the son of Doña Margarita de\r\nHijar, one of her ladies; and, in jealous rage, she smothered her.\r\nWhereupon the King banished his wife to Aragon, and legitimated Don\r\nFerrando as his heir.\r\n\r\nLet it be recognised that, in the fifteenth century, Popes acted, and\r\nwere expected to act, in the letter, as well as in the spirit, of the\r\nmomentous words which are said by the cardinal-archdeacon to all of Them\r\nat Their coronation, _Receive this tiara adorned with three crowns, and\r\nknow Thyself to be the Ruler of the World, the Father of princes and of\r\nkings, and the Earthly Vicar of Jesus Christ our Saviour_. The twentieth\r\ncentury is apt to conceive of the Pope as an uninteresting, far-away,\r\nsemi-diplomatic species of clergyman, nourishing pretensions of utter\r\ninsignificance. It will be well to remember that once upon a time the\r\nPope was a Power, Who saw nothing figurative, metaphorical, or\r\nextravagant in the exordium just quoted, Who was not by any means a\r\nnégligeable quantity in the world’s affairs, and Who literally had the\r\nunquestioned right of making or unmaking princes and kings or even\r\nemperors.\r\n\r\nHere was a case in point. King Don Alonso was a crowned king; but he\r\nperfectly was aware that he was powerless to keep his crown, much less\r\nto secure the succession for the offspring of his illicit love, unless\r\nhe could gain the confirmation, the licence, of the Roman Pontiff—in\r\ntechnical phrase, a sovereign found it to be indispensable that he\r\nshould be able to add to his style of King By The Grace Of God, _And By\r\nThe Favour Of The Apostolic See_.\r\n\r\nHence the embassage to the Lord Eugenius P.P. IV, headed by Bishop\r\nAlonso de Borja, to whose incessant labour and exquisite mastery of\r\naffairs was due the treaty, ratified in 1444, by which the Pope’s\r\nHoliness of the one part confirmed the crown of Naples, the Two\r\nSicilies, and Jerusalem, to King Don Alonso I. de Aragona, and licensed\r\nthe legitimation of Don Ferrando; while the King’s Majesty of the other\r\npart agreed to defend the Lord Eugenius P.P. IV against His enemies, and\r\nespecially against Duke Francesco Sforza-Visconti of Milan.\r\n\r\nAs a reward for his skill in the rôle of peacemaker, Bishop Alonso de\r\nBorja was raised to the purple on the second of May 1444, as\r\nCardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santi Quattro Coronati with curial\r\nrank; and so King Don Alonso, the Magnanimous, lost his most trusted\r\ncounsellor. The Bishop’s bastard, Don Francisco de Borja, who will\r\nappear later in this history, had been born at Savina, in Valencia, in\r\n1441.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal of Valencia at the Court of Rome gained the reputation of\r\nbeing inaccessible to flattery, incapable of party-feeling, impregnable\r\nin integrity, inconspicuous in morals, inexhaustible in capacity for\r\nbusiness and in knowledge of canon-law. In 1446, the Lord Eugenius P.P.\r\nIV restored the Hospital of the Confraternity of Santo Spirito, in the\r\nRegion of Borgc, to something of its pristine glory; and He undertook to\r\ncontribute a yearly sum whereby its usefulness among the poor and needy\r\nmight be maintained. The pontifical example of practical Christian\r\ncharity set a fashion for the cardinals of the curia. The quaint Bull\r\ncontaining the subscribers’ names is signed by\r\n\r\n           _I, Eugenius, The Bishop of the Catholic Church_,\r\n\r\nand by nine cardinals, of whom the last is\r\n\r\n _I, the Cardinal of Valencia, Presbyter of the Title of Santi Quattro\r\n    Coronati_.\r\n\r\nCardinal de Borja assisted at the election of the succeeding Pontiff,\r\nthe Lord Nicholas P.P. V; at Whose death, in 1455, the prediction of St.\r\nVincent Ferrer was fulfilled.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the time of His elevation to the Supreme Pontificate, the Lord\r\nCalixtus P.P. III was a feeble old man of the age of seventy-seven\r\nyears. His duties, as Governor of the Bastard of Naples, as Bishop of\r\nValencia, as Orator of King to Pope, as Plenipotentiary between Pope and\r\nKing, as Counsellor of King, as Cardinal-Counsellor of Pope, and his\r\nceaseless studies in jurisprudence and canon-law, had worn away the\r\nbodily strength of him—the perishable thin scabbard that hid steel\r\nindomitable and keen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Calixtus P.P. III._]\r\n\r\nOutside the Vatican very diverse opinions were entertained of Him. His\r\nlong connection with King Don Alonso I. caused anxiety, suspicion, and\r\njealousy, among the Powers of Italy. They were always disgusted, those\r\nPowers, to find the Pope on easy terms with a temporal sovereign, with\r\none of themselves; and the Magnanimous King Don Alonso was the next-door\r\nneighbour, so to speak, of the Lord Calixtus P.P. III. Such a\r\ncombination inevitably inspired distrust. The fear was expressed that\r\nNaples, through his former secretary, would rule the Holy See—and\r\nChristendom. The official despatches of the Orators of Florence, Genoa,\r\nand Venice, hypocritically displayed the greatest satisfaction: but\r\ntheir private letters were in a diametrically opposing strain. A great\r\ngrievance was made of the fact that the new Pope was a Spaniard and a\r\nforeigner. Some thought that a handful of discontented cardinals should\r\nleave Rome, set up a pseudopontiff in another city, and inaugurate a\r\nFortieth Schism. Oh, people knew one another to be properly cantankerous\r\nin the fifteenth century! But Rome considered the Lord Calixtus P.P. III\r\na just and right-minded man. The Procurator-General of the Order of\r\nTeutonic Knights wrote to the Grand Master on the third of May 1455:\r\n“The new Pope is an old man, of honourable and virtuous life, and of\r\nexcellent repute.” Messer Bartolomeo Michele, a Sienese, wrote to his\r\nnative city, exhorting the Sienesi to send the most splendid possible\r\nembassage to congratulate the Pope, selecting for the same only eminent\r\nand worthy men, inasmuch as that the Lord Calixtus P.P. III was\r\nexcessively learned and clear-sighted: “He is a man of great sanctity\r\nand learning, a friend and adherent of King Don Alonso. He has always\r\nshown Himself well-disposed to our city, and by nature He is peaceable\r\nand kindly.” But the best appreciation of all is given by St. Antonino,\r\nthat gentle, brave Archbishop of Florence, whose quality all the world\r\nadmires and loves. He wrote to Messer Giovanni of Orvieto, the 24th of\r\nApril 1455.\r\n\r\n  “The election of the Lord Calixtus P.P. III at first gave little\r\n  satisfaction to the Italians. Inprimis, he was Valencian or Catalan;\r\n  and they feared lest He should transfer the Papal Court to another\r\n  country. Also, they feared lest He should entrust to Catalans the\r\n  fortresses of Holy Church, which, only after many difficulties, could\r\n  be recovered. But now they are reassured by more mature reflection,\r\n  and by the reputation that He bears for goodness, penetration, and\r\n  impartiality. And, also, I have seen His solemn promise that He will\r\n  devote all His powers against the Turks and for the conquest of\r\n  Constantinople. It is not to be believed or said that He is attached\r\n  to one nation more than another, but rather that, as a just and\r\n  prudent man, He will give to every one his due. Meanwhile, let us\r\n  always think well of the Holy Father, and judge His actions more\r\n  favourably than those of any other human being. And let us not be\r\n  frightened by every little shock. Christ guides the Barque of Peter,\r\n  which, therefore, can never sink.”\r\n\r\nThat letter contains a concise summary of the situation, written with\r\nthe benevolent simplicity of a dignified fine gentleman, and with the\r\nunerring sapience of a saint.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Pope is the Bishop of Rome. The insignia of His office are the\r\nFisherman’s Ring, the Triple Crown, the Triple Cross, and the\r\nKeys. At His election by the Conclave, He receives the Ring.\r\nAfterwards the insignia are conferred, with the Pallium that He\r\nwears at all times in sign of universal jurisdiction, at His\r\ncoronation by the Cardinal-Archdeacon in the Collegiate-Basilica\r\nof St. Peter-by-the-Vatican. But yet another ceremony awaits\r\nperformance. As Bishop of Rome, He must take formal possession of,\r\nand be enthroned in, the cathedral of His diocese, either in\r\nperson or by proxy. That cathedral is not St. Peter’s: but St.\r\nJohn’s _in Laterano_, which, consequently, bears on its façade the\r\nmagniloquent title\r\n\r\n    MOTHER AND MISTRESS OF ALL CHURCHES IN THE CITY AND IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\nIt is the most important church in Christendom.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Lord Calixtus P.P. III was elected on the eighth of April 1455. On\r\nthe twentieth He was crowned as “Ruler of the World, Father of princes\r\nand of kings, and Earthly Vicar of Jesus Christ our Saviour”; and the\r\nsame day He made a triumphal progress through the city to take\r\npossession of the Lateran. In the porch of that cathedral there is a low\r\nmarble throne, called Sedes Stercoraria, on which the Pope sits to\r\nreceive the homage of the Lateran Chapter while cantors chant the anthem\r\n\r\n         “He raiseth-up the poor out of the dust:\r\n         “and lifteth the needy out of the dung-hill.\r\n\r\n         “That He may set him with princes:\r\n         “even with the princes of His people.\r\n                                             (Ps. cxiii. 7, 8).\r\n\r\n         “_Suscitans a terra inopem:\r\n         “et de stercore erigens pauperem._\r\n\r\n         “_Ut collocet eum cum principibus:\r\n         “cum principibus populi Sui._\r\n                                     (Vulgate, Ps. cxii. 6, 7).\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that the Lord Calixtus P.P. III was not unnaturally\r\npopular. It will be readily admitted that the Roman baronial houses of\r\nColonna and Orsini would have been more than human had they not felt\r\nsome mortification at the failure of their conclavial manœuvres to\r\nsecure the Papacy for one of themselves. Still, the thing was done. A\r\nCatalan—the Romans of the fifteenth century called all Spaniards\r\nCatalans—a Catalan indubitably had been elected; but He was old, He was\r\nfeeble, He might be influenced, He might be amenable to intimidation, to\r\na show of force. It is so easy for the twentieth century, with its jaded\r\nphysique and sophisticated brain, and the magnificent perspective of\r\nhalf a thousand years, to read the motives which actuated the physically\r\nstrong and intellectually simple fifteenth, when the world—the dust\r\nwhich makes man’s flesh—was five centuries younger and fresher; when\r\ncolour was vivid; light, a blaze; virtue and vice, extreme; passion,\r\nprimitive and ardent; life, violent; youth, intense, supreme; and\r\nsententious pettifogging respectable mediocrity, senile and debile, of\r\nno importance whatever.\r\n\r\nSo, while the Lord Calixtus P.P. III was at the Lateran, the barons of\r\nRome took action. A slight quarrel arising in the crowd between one of\r\nthe Orsini and a retainer of Anguillara (hereditary foes of Orsini)\r\nprovided a pretext. Instantly shouts ascended, and men of arms coursed\r\nthrough the city roaring _Orso, Orso_ (Bear, Bear—war-cry of Orsini,\r\nalluding to their badge). From every dark and narrow alley of the\r\nRegions of Campo Marzo and Ponte, from the Albergo dell Orso (Bear Inn)\r\nby the Torre di Nona, from the castellated fortress which Orsini had\r\nmade of Pompey’s Theatre, came the clang of arms, with the rush of\r\nhurrying feet of desperate brigands, adherents and mercenaries of\r\nOrsini; and Don Napoleone Orsini was at the head of three thousand men.\r\nOutside the cathedral, the hum of a maddened mob swelled into a raucous\r\nroar as of bears hungry for hot blood, when Count Averso of Anguillara\r\nfled into the Lateran Basilica, seeking sanctuary in the very presence\r\nof Christ’s Vicar; and, above the roar, the voice of Orsini pierced the\r\nholy portals of the Prince of Peace, penetrated to the ears of Pope\r\nCalixtus throned as Bishop of Rome among His canons in the centre of the\r\napse, launching a hideous threat to storm and sack the Lateran unless\r\nthe body of Anguillara were given to him as meat for his three thousand\r\nbears. There was a movement in the ermine and scarlet college that stood\r\nnear the papal throne, and Cardinal Latino Orsini di Bari hurried down\r\nthe nave to confer with his turbulent brother, Don Napoleone. Though\r\ndisappointed that he had failed to win the Triregno[10] for himself,\r\nthis cardinal appears to have had some feeling of decency as to what was\r\ndue to Holy Church. As a churchman he felt bound to stand by his order;\r\nalthough as an Orsini he would have preferred a different state of\r\naffairs. Still, the object of the riot had been attained, the Lord\r\nCalixtus P.P III had received an object-lesson poignant and pregnant to\r\nan ultimate degree, concerning the kind of kakodaimons that He would\r\nhave to quell, the species of subject that He was called to rule. No\r\ndoubt these were the arguments used to his brother by the cardinal. It\r\nwas not the writhing mangled body of the Eel (Anguillara) that the Bear\r\n(Orsini) craved. That was the merest subterfuge. But to humiliate the\r\nHoliness of the Pope at the very moment of His exaltation from Sedes\r\nStercoraria to Lateran Throne, to terrify Him into malleability, into\r\nsubjugation to Orsini’s will—that—that had been done, and well done.\r\nSurely an aged man, so near His grave as was the Lord Calixtus P.P. III,\r\nwould wish to purchase peace with any sacrifice, now that once it had\r\nbeen shown to Him what kind of devildom environed His very throne-steps.\r\nDon Napoleone Orsini allowed himself to take this view. He withdrew his\r\nmyrmidons. The riot was over. Presently the Pope was riding on His\r\ncrimson-caparisoned palfrey towards the Vatican, through a peaceful city\r\nkneeling at the roadside for Apostolic Benediction.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fashion which foreigners affect in writing of Italy makes one\r\nlaugh—and weep.\r\n\r\nThey drawl of a dreamland of subtle sweetness and softest light, of\r\ndelicate fantasy, of neutral hue; peopled by shades from faded frescoes\r\næsthetically tinctured, academic, conventional, conformant to the canons\r\nof that unspeakably abominable dilution which the twentieth century\r\ncalls Art; and mitigated only by a leavening of organ-grinders and\r\nfortune-telling paroquets.\r\n\r\nThey must be blind, these foreigners—blind, physically and\r\nmentally—blind, as those who will not see.\r\n\r\nItaly is, and always has been, a land of raw reality, of glittering\r\nlight, of pure primary colour, of nature naked and not ashamed, of\r\nperfectly transparent souls, of rapidest versatility, clearest mystery,\r\nultimate simplicity, steel, and brains, and blood.\r\n\r\nElse she had made no mark, no singular distinguished mark, in history.\r\n\r\nHas she made no mark?\r\n\r\nAh—what a mark she has made!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe greatest historian of this period, perhaps the most alert and agile\r\nwriter of any period, Enea Silvio Bartolomeo de’ Piccolhuomini (who\r\nafterwards became Pope with the title of the Lord Pius P.P. II), says of\r\nthe Lord Calixtus P.P. III, that His attention to the duties of His\r\noffice was amazing; that His patience at audiences was astounding; that\r\nHe Himself dictated the Apostolic Briefs and Bulls written to kings and\r\nprinces, nor trusted them to the official scribes; that jurisprudence\r\nwas His recreation; that He was as familiar with canon-law as though He\r\nwere still professor at the University of Lerida.\r\n\r\nTwo problems confronted Him at the beginning of His reign: the\r\nRenascence of Learning, and the Infidel in Christendom. His predecessor\r\nhad been a man of words. The Lord Calixtus P.P. III was a man of\r\nstrenuous deeds. His attitude to Letters and Art was in strong contrast\r\nto that of the Lord Nicholas P.P. V. This “withered canonist,” as a wit\r\nstyled Him, was not in sympathy with Culture. Wholly occupied in matters\r\necclesiastical and political, He had nor time nor means nor inclination\r\nto patronise the fashionable scholarship of His day. His vogue was\r\nstrictly practical.\r\n\r\nOne of the secrets of the success of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and\r\nRoman Church is her catholicity. All sorts and conditions of men can,\r\nand do, live within her boundaries. The Lord Nicholas P.P. V had been a\r\nMaecenas of Letters and the Arts. In His reign scholars, scribes, and\r\nartificers had found their golden age. The Lord Calixtus P.P. III\r\nentirely employed Himself in the defence of Christendom, and the clients\r\nof His predecessor were conscious of the change. Literature and the fine\r\narts have one very sorry effect upon their professors. Intellectual\r\nculture avidly pursued makes its devotees show pitifully by the side of\r\nthe manly men who deal with realities and verities, with life and death,\r\nthe sailors, soldiers, adventurers, and empire-builders. Letters and the\r\nArts cultivate the baser parts of man—meanness, jealousy, conceit. The\r\ntouchy nature of the writers and artists of 1455 led to violent\r\ndenunciations of the Spanish Pope. Messer Francesco Filelfo’s letter\r\n(102) to the Cardinal of Trebizond shows how men of letters hated Him.\r\nAnother writer charged Him with destroying the Vatican library. Bishop\r\nVespasiano da Bisticci, of Vicenza, says:\r\n\r\n  “When Pope Calixtus began His reign, and saw so many excellent books,\r\n  five hundred of them resplendent in bindings of crimson velvet with\r\n  clasps of silver, He wondered greatly (it should be remembered that\r\n  printing was not invented), for the old canonist only was used to\r\n  books written on linen (?) and stitched together. Instead of\r\n  commending the wisdom of His predecessor, He cried, on entering the\r\n  library, _See now where the treasure of God’s Church has gone_. Soon\r\n  He began to disperse the Greek books. He gave several hundred to the\r\n  Cardinal of Ruthenia. As this latter was in his dotage, the volumes\r\n  fell into his servants’ hands. Things which had been bought for golden\r\n  florins[11] were sold for a few pence. Many Latin books came to\r\n  Barcelona: some through the Bishop of Vich, powerful Datary of the\r\n  Pope; some as gifts to Catalan nobles.\r\n\r\nCalumny (which, by the bye, ranks as mortal sin in modern catechisms,)\r\nappears to be habitual to the faithful. In this particular the fifteenth\r\ncentury meets the twentieth on common ground. To speak truth in a\r\nparadox, the proximate occasion of the sin of calumny is hatred of sin.\r\nRoman Catholics, like Bishop Vespasiano, are, from their conception,\r\nimbued and saturated with the idea of the hideousness of sin, not of its\r\nstupidity and unprofitableness. It is their bogey, their forbidden\r\nfruit, the covert strictly preserved and labelled Trespassers will be\r\nprosecuted with the utmost rigour of the Law. Consequently, Roman\r\nCatholic human nature is violently fascinated by the bogey; has\r\nsingularly well informed itself of the nature, colour, shape, condition,\r\nand location, of the forbidden fruit; has minutely investigated every\r\ninch of ground and every blade of grass, and every bird and bush in the\r\nstrictly preserved covert, simply and solely in order that it may avoid\r\npoaching, sampling the forbidden fruit, or becoming a prey for the\r\nbogey. When one has the duty of avoiding a thing, it is well to know\r\nwhat the thing is which one must avoid; but it is quite easy to know\r\nmore than enough. All this intimate realisation of the hideousness of\r\nsin, this systematic cataloguing of its divisions and sub-divisions,\r\nwith elaborate excursions along its divers ramifications, certainly\r\ninspires a loathing of the intensest kind. It also has another effect.\r\nIt induces an exaggerated consciousness of virtue. When human nature\r\nknows, and is able to describe, with a wealth of detail ordinarily\r\ninaccessible, the horrible things which it does not do, it becomes\r\n“puffed up,” in the words of St. Paul. This condition of “unctuous\r\nrectitude,” inspired entirely by a horror of sin, is a proximate\r\noccasion of the sin of calumny. Roman Catholic human nature, not\r\nunconscious of its own integrity, when confronted by an antipathetic\r\npersonality, instantly conceives of the latter as a sinner. I am\r\nright—you disagree with me—therefore you are wrong—is the absurd\r\nsyllogism or logical process which it uses. And, drawing upon its\r\ncopious catalogues of sins, on the principle that he who offends in the\r\nleast is guilty of all, Roman Catholic human nature will proceed to shew\r\nhow exceedingly sinful it is possible for an enemy to be. The said\r\nenemy, or perhaps a mere opponent, incontinently finds himself accused\r\nof breaking the Ten Commandments of God, the various Precepts of the\r\nChurch; of committing the Seven Deadly Sins—Pride, Covetousness, Lust,\r\nAnger, Gluttony, Envy, Sloth; the Six Sins against the Holy\r\nGhost—Presumption of God’s Mercy, Despair, Impugning the Known Truth,\r\nEnvy at another’s Spiritual Good, Obstinacy in Sin, Final Impenitence;\r\nthe Four Sins Crying to Heaven for Vengeance—Wilful Murder, Sin of the\r\nCities of the Plain, Oppression of the Poor, Defrauding Labourers of\r\ntheir Wages; or, if he has not achieved the guilt of these in his proper\r\nperson, at least he has been an accomplice of some other sinner, in the\r\nNine Ways by which a Man may be Accessory to Another’s Sin—_i.e._, by\r\ncounsel, command, consent, provocation, by praise or flattery, by\r\nconcealment, by partaking, by silence, by defence of the ill which is\r\ndone. That is, (in the twentieth century when Catholics are ruled by a\r\nPress ostentatiously Fenian and Anglophobe, and was, in the fifteenth\r\ncentury when Catholics were also human, but not vulgar or\r\nsophisticated), the predicament of anybody, Pope or peasant, who incurs,\r\nor incurred, the disesteem of, or who makes, or made, himself unpleasant\r\nto a brother in the Faith. By hints, inferences, insinuations,\r\nill-motives assigned, and a hundred ingenious methods, rarely by defined\r\naccusations, the sin of calumny is, and was, committed, absolutely and\r\nutterly because the calumniator so hates sin as to have no difficulty in\r\npersuading himself that the man who flouts him must be a sinner. For be\r\nit noted, that all the calumnies that bespatter the House of Borgia, all\r\nthe “liability to disesteem,” which through five centuries has been\r\ntheir portion, and has made their very name a synonym of Turpitude, all\r\nthese have a Roman Catholic origin. Roman Catholics are the primal\r\ncalumniators who have muddied, and do muddy, God’s Vicegerents, the Lord\r\nCalixtus P.P. III, and His nephew the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, with every\r\nspecies of ordure, with ascriptions of every crime known to casuistry\r\n(the science of cases of conscience), including those which are\r\nunspeakable except in an appendix veiled in a learned language _quo\r\nminus erubescamus_. Bishop Vespasiano da Bisticci of Vicenza was a Roman\r\nCatholic; Messer Stefano Infessura, Monsignor Hans Burchard, Messer\r\nFrancesco Guicciardini, Bishop Paolo Giovio of Nocera, Messer Giangiovio\r\nPontano, Sannazar “The Christian Vergil,” Messer Benedetto Varchi—they\r\nwere all Roman Catholics who inaugurated the campaign of calumny against\r\nthe Supreme Pontiffs of the House of Borgia. In dealing with calumny,\r\nthe difficulty is to obtain definite evidence of a definite charge which\r\nis intrinsically false and, at the same time, derogatory to the person\r\nagainst whom it is laid. This difficulty is one that continually\r\nconfronts the investigator. Prelates, priests, princes, penmen,\r\nsometimes because they had a grievance, sometimes confessedly wilfully,\r\nsometimes by way of wanton babble, habitually launched against their\r\nenemies or superiors accusations of depravity the most loathsome, of\r\ncrime the most odious. What they said by word of mouth cannot surely be\r\nknown Until The Books Are Opened. What they wrote in pasquinades, in\r\ndiaries, in official despatches, in official chronicles, or for the mere\r\næsthetic pleasure of recording a salacious gibe in curial Tuscan or in\r\ngolden Latin—these remain. A few of the more important icily will be\r\ndiscussed here. The student of history knows no more refreshing\r\nrecreation than that of nailing liars, like vermin, to the wall.\r\n\r\nThe statement of Bishop Vespasiano da Bisticci of Vicenza, quoted above,\r\nis a fair example of the less fœtid species of calumny: it only amounts\r\nto an accusation of “philistinism.” However, it at once may be described\r\nas being both stupid and improbable. With regard to the naif surprize,\r\nsaid to have been shown by the Lord Calixtus P.P. III, on seeing “so\r\nmany excellent books,” is it likely that, as Bishop Alonso de Borja,\r\nAmbassador Plenipotentiary and Confidential Counsellor of the Majesty of\r\nNaples, he never had seen fine things before? Is it likely that Cardinal\r\nAlonso de Borja, eleven years cardinal of the curia residing in the\r\nCourt of Rome, had never seen splendid books before? Of what kind then\r\nwere the missals and pontificals which, as bishop, he would have used in\r\nhis daily mass? Is it likely that Cardinal Alonso de Borja—one of the\r\nactual electors of the Lord Nicholas P.P. V, constantly at His side from\r\nbeginning to end of His reign, if not assistant to, at least cognizant\r\nof, His every action—had never seen, had never touched, handled, tasted,\r\nthose identical five hundred books, bound in crimson velvet with clasps\r\nof silver, with which that august Pontiff enriched the Vatican library.\r\nThe assumption is ridiculous, absurd.\r\n\r\nThe calumny that the Lord Calixtus P.P. III gave books to the Bishop of\r\nVich in the manner of a Vandal arose in this way. The Lord Cosimo de\r\nMonserrato, Bishop of Vich from 1460 to 1471, was ordered by His\r\nHoliness to compile a catalogue of the books in the Vatican library, on\r\nthe sixteenth of April 1455, four days before His coronation. A copy of\r\nthis catalogue was brought to Vich by this same Lord Cosimo on his\r\nappointment to the bishopric five years later. It was most likely made\r\nby one of the Vatican scribes,[12] and it contains numerous marginal\r\nnotes in the bishop’s handwriting. From these notes, a precise list of\r\nthe number of books actually given away by the Lord Calixtus P.P. III\r\nmay be obtained. They were five—not “several hundred”—of no great value,\r\nand—duplicates. Two of these, a copy of the Epistles of St. Augustine,\r\nannotated by Nicholas of Lira, and a Book on the Truth of the Catholic\r\nFaith, were presented to the Pope’s late patron, King Don Alonso de\r\nAragona of Naples, the Two Sicilies, and Jerusalem. The note against\r\nthem in the catalogue is _S.D.N. dedit hunc domino regi Arag._ (“Our\r\nHoly Lord gave this to the lord king of Aragon.”) Now, if He only gave\r\ntwo books to His old friend and former employer who (as may be judged\r\nfrom the fact that he employed the renowned Messeri Lorenzo Valla and\r\nGiangiovio Pontano as his secretaries) had a very pretty taste for\r\nletters, who was a reigning sovereign, and an extremely serviceable and\r\npowerful ally of the Holy See, is He likely to have given “several\r\nhundred” to the Cardinal of Ruthenia and Catalan nobles? Finally, the\r\nheathen Cardinal Platina, who wrote his History of the Popes in the\r\nreign of the Lord Xystus[13] P.P. IV (the third in succession from the\r\nLord Calixtus P.P. III,) expressly mentions the magnificence of the\r\nlibrary of the Lord Nicholas P.P. V, which, certainly, he could not have\r\nknown if it had been destroyed in the manner described by the lying\r\nBishop Vespasiano da Bisticci of Vicenza.\r\n\r\nOne “philistine” act may be admitted on behalf of the Lord Calixtus P.P.\r\nIII. He sold the silver from the bindings of those books. He sacrificed\r\nthem for the crusade in defence of Christendom. He also sold all the\r\nVatican plate. He insisted that the salt-cellar of His Own table should\r\nbe of earthenware, not gold; and, indeed, He even offered His tiara in\r\npledge for the same admirable object. He was blamed.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Calixtus P.P. III was by no means the enemy of letters. He made\r\nhavoc among the decadents, the affected literary poseurs who infested\r\nthe Borgian as well as the Victorian Era; but He cherished genius, and\r\nto scholars of distinction He was a generous patron. The diverting case\r\nof Messer Lorenzo Valla will serve for an example. This notable, being\r\none of the secretaries of King Don Alonso I, was well-known to the\r\nHoliness of the Pope. He was erudite beyond most of his contemporaries,\r\nof a daring temperament, and impatient of bad scholarship, falsehood,\r\nand superstition. In 1440 he indited a merciless exposure of the\r\nmonstrous fiction now known as the Forged Decretals and Donation of\r\nConstantine, upon which, in perfect good faith, the temporal dominions\r\nof the Papacy then were held. Also, he attacked the leaden Latin of the\r\nVulgate, and lauded the Golden Latin of Vergil and Cicero, or the Silver\r\nLatin of Tacitus. The twentieth century—which knows the Latin of the\r\nRoman Mass to be the low Latin of Roman plebeians of the first five\r\ncenturies, from the age of the Lord St. Peter P.P. to that of His\r\nsuccessor the Lord St. Gelasius P.P., Whose “Prayer for Peace” is the\r\nlatest known addition to the canon—will not find Messer Lorenzo Valla to\r\nhave been guilty of any very shocking crime herein. But the clergy of\r\nNaples considered him in the light of a menace to the Christian\r\nPalladium, and mentioned him to the Inquisition. When he was brought\r\nbefore them, the Inquisitors invited him formally to assent to a\r\nprofession of faith, which was neither the Apostles’ nor the Nicene\r\nCreed, nor the Creed of St. Athanasius, but one which they had drawn up\r\nto suit the fancied needs of his case. The situation was the historical\r\nparallel of one which sullied the dying years of the last century.\r\nMesser Lorenzo knew too much; took an impish delight in saying what he\r\nknew; he was a nuisance, a disturbing influence. To the proposition of\r\nthe Inquisition he opposed a firm refusal; he would not sign their\r\nspecimen of a creed. The circumstances now were becoming strained. But\r\nthe Inquisitors of the fifteenth century had more serpentine wisdom than\r\nthose of the nineteenth. They did not proceed at once to an abrupt and\r\ntactless excommunication, exacerbating to all parties. They tried\r\nanother line. Would Messer Lorenzo Valla have the courtesy, then, to\r\npropound his own creed, that his judges might examine whether it were\r\nheretical or no? The reply of Messer Lorenzo was delicious. “I believe,”\r\nhe said, “I believe what Holy Mother Church believes. She _knows_\r\nnothing. But—I _believe_ what she _believes_.” Just at this stage the\r\nking sent a mandate to the Inquisitors of Naples, bidding them to leave\r\nhis Majesty’s secretary alone; and the process ended here. But when the\r\nnews of the case travelled to Rome, the Lord Nicholas P.P. V, admiring\r\nthe wit and learning of Messer Lorenzo Valla, being amused, perhaps, at\r\nthe way in which he had taken the wind out of the sail of the wily\r\nInquisitors, invited the distinguished scholar to His Court, where He\r\nnamed him Apostolic scribe, with magnificent appointments. On the death\r\nof that Pontiff, Messer Lorenzo’s sometime colleague, the Lord Calixtus\r\nP.P. III made him Pontifical Secretary, and dignified him with several\r\ncanonries including one at St. John _in Laterano_, the cathedral-church\r\nof Rome. So fifteenth century tact and mental limberness made a friend,\r\nwhere nineteenth century arrogant stupidity made a host of scornful\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first year of the pontificate of the Lord Calixtus P.P. III was\r\noccupied by audiences granted to Orators offering the homage of the\r\nPowers, and by preparations for the Crusade.\r\n\r\nGermany deserved and enjoyed high consideration, because the ruler of\r\nGermany held the title of _Romanorum Imperator Caesar Semper Augustus\r\nMundi Totius Dominus Universis Principibus et Populis Semper\r\nVenerandus_; and an understanding between Pope and Emperor, a friendship\r\nbetween Peter and Caesar, was desirable for the peace and prosperity of\r\nChristendom. This friendship, however, was subject to frequent breaches.\r\nBoth Papacy and Empire were exceedingly tenacious of their dignity,\r\nwilling to consider themselves aggrieved, or their rights in danger of\r\nencroachment. Each, in fact, was a power of dimensions so gigantic that\r\nintermittent paroxysms of megalomania were the order of the day. The\r\nviolence of these attacks was allayed, from time to time, by cooling\r\nlotions in the shape of concessions. There had been a serious relapse\r\nnot many years before, which temporarily had been retrieved by a treaty,\r\nknown as the Concordat of the Lord Eugenius P.P. IV.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of His reign, while waiting for the formal homage of\r\nThe Pacific Caesar Friedrich IV, the Lord Calixtus P.P. III observed the\r\nterms of this Concordat. When the news of His election in April reached\r\nGermany, a Diet of the Empire was held at Neustadt to appoint\r\nOrators,[14] and to consider the chances of squeezing fresh concessions.\r\n“Now is the time to vindicate our liberty, for hitherto we have only\r\nbeen the handmaid of Holy Church,” said Jacob of Trier; and Caesar\r\nFriedrich IV privately grieved that the Papacy gave him little support\r\nin his difficulties with turbulent sub-sovereigns and subjects. The\r\ncelebrated Lord Enea Silvio Bartolomeo de’ Piccolhuomini, Bishop of\r\nSiena, poured oil upon the troubled waters of the Diet. He had lived\r\nmany years in Germany, as poet-laureate, orator to Utter Britain[15]\r\n(Scotland), novelist, historian, and confidential secretary to Caesar;\r\nand he knew his Germany. He deservedly was trusted both by Church and\r\nState. He soothed Caesar, saying that the mob was always inconstant,\r\ndangerous, and that a ruler did a vain thing when he tried to please. He\r\nsoothed the Diet, saying that the interests of Papacy and Empire were\r\nidentical, and that from a new Pope new favours might be gained. The\r\nDiet named Bishop Enea Silvio, with the jurist Hans Hagenbach, as\r\norators who were to offer to the Lord Calixtus P.P. III the obedience of\r\nthe Holy Roman Empire, and to lay before Him the grievances of Caesar.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Calixtus P.P. III was more independent of Germany than His two\r\npredecessors had been; and in a position to command, not compromise. The\r\nLord Eugenius P. P. IV, being in need of temporal support, had purchased\r\nGermany’s obedience by secret concessions and promises of money. The\r\nLord Nicholas P.P. V was privy to these arrangements, and, feeling bound\r\nby them, had paid His share; but there was a matter of twenty-five\r\nthousand ducats yet unpaid. The Lord Calixtus P.P. III had taken no part\r\nin these negotiations. During His cardinalate, He had had ample\r\nopportunities of reckoning up Caesar Friedrich IV as a feeble, feckless\r\nold simpleton, devoid of moral backbone, whom no concessions ever could\r\nstiffen into any semblance of imperial capacity. The Pope’s Holiness\r\nfelt that He could do quite well without the Emperor’s Augustitude.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when Caesar’s Orators arrived in Rome, on the tenth of August\r\n1455, and prayed for a private audience, (at which, as the custom was,\r\nthey would try to squeeze the Holy Father, making the proffer of their\r\nsovereign’s homage dependent upon the Pope’s willingness to oblige), the\r\nLord Calixtus P.P. III refused to entertain requests until after the\r\nobedience of Germany should have been received.\r\n\r\nThe Orators were confounded, so they said, by this demand; but, as loyal\r\nsons of Holy Mother Church, (Bishop Enea Silvio was the spokesman), and\r\nthat scandal might be avoided, they would give way. Before a public\r\nconsistory of cardinals, they presented to the Pope the homage of\r\nCaesar, in an elaborate oration containing no mention of unpleasant\r\ntopics, such as the imperial demands and the Concordat of the Lord\r\nEugenius P.P. IV, but mainly consisting of a string of formal\r\ncompliments to the Supreme Pontiff, and declamations against the Muslim\r\nInfidel. (Pii II. Orationes I, 336.)\r\n\r\nAfter this the Orators could not insist upon the Rights of Caesar. On\r\nhis behalf, they might only approach the strenuous Pope as suppliants\r\nappealing to His clemency, as children begging a father’s favour. They\r\nhad cut the ground from under their own feet; and, as Bishop Enea Silvio\r\nknew quite well, that was precisely what had been intended. The Lord\r\nCalixtus P.P. III disclaimed any obligation of paying His predecessor’s\r\ndebts, having other uses for five and twenty thousand ducats; and the\r\nquestion of Caesar’s rights to nominate to bishoprics, and to have a\r\nshare of the tithe about to be raised for the Crusade, should be\r\nconsidered in due season, said the Pope to the Orators.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Eternal City was engaged in making ready for war.\r\nImmediately after His coronation, the Lord Calixtus P.P. III privately\r\nproclaimed the Crusade. In August, He made the same proclamation in\r\npublic consistory, and read the following vow: “We, Calixtus the\r\nPontiff, swear to God Almighty, the Holy and Undivided Trinity, that We\r\nrelentlessly will follow the Turks, the enemies of the Name of Christ,\r\nwith war, with maledictions, with interdicts, with execrations, and\r\nindeed with every means in Our power.” (Ciacconi II., 981.) This oath in\r\nholograph, was constantly before the Pope’s eyes during His pontificate,\r\nand was found hanging on the wall by His bedside as an ornament of His\r\nchamber when at length He died.\r\n\r\nThe infirmities of age chained the Pontiff to His room: recreation was\r\nto Him a thing unknown, for the business of the Crusade consumed His\r\nenergies. His firm and unrelenting will, set upon this single aim, would\r\nbrook no control, no influence. He knew Himself to be the “Ruler of the\r\nWorld,” and He shut His mouth down fast against all opposition. To the\r\nquarrelsome sovereigns of Christendom He envoyed ablegates charged to\r\nreconcile all differences, to urge the setting aside of private\r\nsquabbles, of petty ambitions, in favour of the greater necessity,\r\nresistance to and annihilation of the Muslim Infidel. Through every\r\nChristian country He sent Apostolic Missionaries, curial bishops and\r\nprelates, friars and monks renowned for eloquence, to preach the sacred\r\nduty of fighting against the enemies of the Christian Faith. On every\r\nChristian country He imposed tax of a tithe to meet the cost of the\r\nCrusade. Archbishop St. Antonino of Florence nobly seconded His efforts,\r\nraising the standard of St. George’s rose-red cross, and preaching like\r\na new St. Bernard. The buildings, with which the preceding Pontiff had\r\nbegun to adorn the city, were stopped, and the swarms of workmen\r\ndismissed. The revenues of the Papal States were applied to the\r\nconstruction of a fleet of swift galleys for the harrying of the Turk.\r\nDaily the Holy Father descended to St. Peter’s with His Own hands to fix\r\nthe cross on the breasts of recruits enlisting. The papal jewels were\r\npawned, and their price added to the war-chest. The Pope’s Holiness\r\ntrusted much in Duke Philip of Burgundy: He tried to persuade the\r\nMagnanimous King Don Alonso de Aragona to take the cross.\r\n\r\nIn the east of Europe, the black cloud of the Muslim Infidel advanced\r\ncontinually. Skanderbeg, a chieftain of romantic past, renowned for\r\nmilitary deeds, opposed them. The fame of his achievements is the one\r\nbrightness in the holy war. His army, composed of divers races naturally\r\nantagonistic, only was welded together by the magic of success or of his\r\npersonal influence. Such a bond is but a weak one. A cause, that rests\r\nupon a single man, will stand no strain. Presently his Albanians\r\nrevolted, at a moment when the Infidel pressed him hard. Defeated, he\r\nwithdrew to mountain fastnesses; and sent couriers to Rome with an\r\nappeal for reinforcement. The Lord Calixtus P.P. III replied with money,\r\nwherewith Skanderbeg bought the allegiance of his disaffected troops and\r\nretrieved his position. But on the heels of triumph came fresh disaster.\r\nTo avenge some slight, his own nephew made cause against him, persuaded\r\nthe Albanians to fresh revolt, and deserted with them to the Infidel.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the nature of human things, every man, in every rank of life, must\r\nsubmit to some affliction of mind or body. Has any one ever troubled to\r\ninquire what may be the special affliction proper to the Pope? It is\r\nloneliness—utter loneliness—loneliness in a crowd. The Pope cannot have\r\na friend; for friendship postulates equality: and who is the equal of\r\nthe Pope? The cardinals who surround Him are of the faction that opposed\r\nHis election, or of the faction that claims favour in return for\r\nsupport. He, Who sits upon the Throne of Peter, looks down from that\r\npinnacle upon the peoples, the nations, and the tongues, in His heart\r\nknowing them to be enemies or suitors. What wonder then that, though His\r\nspirit indeed be willing, His humanity shall crave human sympathy!\r\n\r\nThis consideration is offered to explain the nepotism of the Popes of\r\nthe Renascence. They surrounded Themselves with men of Their own\r\nfamilies; men bound to Them by ties of blood and kinship. Being\r\ngenerally of mature age themselves, They chose Their young relations;\r\nand upon these They conferred the rank which qualified them to enter the\r\ninner circle of the curia. This action appears to have been dictated by\r\nthe natural desire of human man for offspring. Certainly a Pope can\r\nalways create cardinals, who are to Him as spiritual sons; but to create\r\ncardinals of those who already are of one’s own family is a thing\r\nnearer, a more intimate relation. So the human heart of the Pope would\r\nbecome rejuvenate, would renew its strength, would gratify its natural\r\nlonging for an entourage of creatures in which it might place confidence\r\nand trust. For the cardinal-nephews, loathed by all other cardinals,\r\nowing everything to the Pope, would be bound to Him and to His interest\r\nas by chains of iron. The system is proved to be liable to abuse. That\r\nis the corollary of all human systems. It is indefensible; but it is\r\nexplicable; and the foregoing is an attempt only in the direction of\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nOn the twentieth of February 1456, at the beginning of the second year\r\nof His reign, the Lord Calixtus P.P. III proclaimed to a stormy\r\nconsistory the creation of three cardinals, two being His Own nephews,\r\nand one the son of the heir to the crown of Portugal. Let it be remarked\r\nthat He did nothing for His son, Don Francisco de Borja, now a charming\r\nand eligible young man of fifteen years.\r\n\r\nThe Sacred College murmured and objected: but, in this matter the will\r\nof the Pope is law. The new creatures were:—\r\n\r\n(α) Don Luis Juan de Mila y Borja, of the age of twenty years,\r\ncelebrated for vigorous physical beauty. He was son of Doña Caterina de\r\nBorja (sister of the Pope’s Holiness) by her husband Don Juan de Mila,\r\nBaron of Mazalanes. To him the Pontiff gave the scarlet hat, which He\r\nhad relinquished on His election to the papacy, that of\r\nCardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santi Quattro Coronati.\r\n\r\n(β) Don Rodrigo de Lançol y Borja, of the age of twenty-five years,\r\ndistinguished by that marvellous Spanish courtliness and magnificence of\r\nperson which was the theme of admiration until he died. He was son of\r\nDoña Juana de Borja, (sister of the Pope’s Holiness,) by her husband Don\r\nJofre de Lançol. To him the Pontiff gave the scarlet hat of\r\nCardinal-Deacon of San Niccolo _in Carcere Tulliano_.\r\n\r\n(γ) Don Jayme de Portugal, Archbishop of Lisbon and son of the Infante\r\nDon Pedro de Portugal. To him the Pontiff gave the scarlet hat of\r\nCardinal-Deacon of Sant’ Eustachio. There appear to have been reasons of\r\nstate for the elevation of this young man; and it was usual for the\r\nreigning Houses of Europe to have one of their junior scions in the\r\nSacred College. The Cardinal of Portugal lived a retired and saint-like\r\nlife, distinguished for his modesty and maiden purity. He died in 1459\r\nat the age of five and twenty years; and his tomb, by Messer Antonio\r\nRossellino, in Samminiato al Monte at Florence, one of the most\r\nexquisite monuments of the Renascence, bears the touching epitaph:\r\n\r\n             “Regia stirps Jacobus nomen Lusitana propago,\r\n               “Insignis forma, summa pudicitia,\r\n             “Cardineus titulus, morum nitor, optima vita,\r\n               “Iste fuere mihi: mors iuuenem rapuit;\r\n               “Ne se pollueret, maluit iste mori.\r\n\r\nBishop Enea Silvio Bartolomeo de’ Piccolhuomini says of these creatures\r\nin his commentaries, “All are young, but of an excellent nature.” The\r\nonly concession that the Pope would make to the objecting cardinals, was\r\nthe postponement of the ceremonial conferring of insignia until the\r\nensuing September; when many of the malcontents vented vain spleen by\r\nquitting Rome.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis was a year of strife. The peace of central Italy was disturbed by\r\nthe bandit Niccolo Piccinino, a bastard of Visconti; who, believing the\r\ncountry to be about to be denuded of armed men, saw an opportunity for\r\nself aggrandisement. He collected mercenaries, and marched against\r\nSiena, a small republic, very loyal to the Holy See, which, in this age\r\nof culture, had destroyed the lovely Aphrodite of Lusippos in its dread\r\nof paganism, and consecrated itself to Madonna under the title “Sena\r\nCiuitas Virginis.” Meeting the Papal and Milanese forces which were\r\nconcentrating for the Crusade, but quite ready for a little incidental\r\nfighting on the way, Piccinino withdrew to the mountains. King Don\r\nAlonso of the Regno, as usual, was playing a double part. It did not\r\nsuit him to show conspicuous friendship for the Pope’s allies, lest the\r\nLord Calixtus P.P. III should become independent. Stipulations were made\r\nfavourable to Piccinino; and, their appeal to Naples having failed, the\r\nSienesi were forced into a disgraceful peace with the brigand.\r\n\r\nSultàn Muhammed extended his conquests to Servia, and prepared to devour\r\nHungary, launching one hundred and fifty thousand infidels against\r\nBelgrade. Fra Jan Capistran’s eloquence and pious zeal roused the\r\nMagyars to consciousness of the imminent peril; Cardinal Bernardino\r\nCaravajal, the ablegate, inspired their patriotism with his wisdom and\r\ndevotion; and Jan Hunniades, the Vaivod of Hungary, resolved to resist\r\ninvasion. Confidence in princes was, as always, vain. The\r\nterror-stricken King Wladislaw fled with his court and his guardian,\r\nCount de Cilly, from Buda to Venice; and along the valley of the Danube\r\npoured the locust-swarms of Infidels to invest Belgrade. The Vaivod Jan\r\nHunniades raised an army at his own expense; whence came the means, the\r\nmen, is still unknown, for most important documents connected with the\r\nsiege of Belgrade yet attend discovery: but there was a Magyar army,\r\ncommanded by Jan Hunniades, ministered to by Fra Jan Capistran, which\r\nadvanced to relieve Belgrade; and the ablegate, Fra Bernardino\r\nCaravajal, remained behind at Buda, by the Vaivod’s request, to collect\r\nand forward reinforcements. On the fourteenth day of siege the Magyars\r\ncollided with the Infidels. Already the walls of Belgrade sorely were\r\nshaken: but the arrival of the Vaivod, breaking the Muslim line and\r\nwinning a complete victory, put courage into the hearts of the\r\nbeleaguered. In three months time, once more the Muslim concentrated,\r\nand on the twenty-first of July the city suffered a second storm. Jan\r\nHunniades and Fra Jan Capistran, from one of the towers, directed the\r\ndefence. At a crisis in the fray, the heroic friar rushed, like a second\r\nJoshua, through the Christian host, waving the crucifix and a banner\r\nwith the sacred monogram invented by San Bernardino of Siena. Behind him\r\ncame the Vaivod with aid. Through breaches in the walls many times the\r\nInfidels streamed in, and always the stream was dammed and driven back.\r\nFra Jan Capistran himself led a squadron of Magyar huszars[16] who put\r\nto flight the fierce janissaries of Islam. And, at last, the day was\r\nwon; and the air resounded with the Most Holy Name shouted by victorious\r\nCrusaders, while Sultàn Muhammed, wounded, was retreating in confusion\r\nwith the remnant of his conquered army. Belgrade was relieved.\r\n\r\nWhen the news reached Rome, the Holiness of the Pope was lying sick,\r\nheart-worn, heart-sore, gazing from His window at the galleys building\r\nin shipwrights’ yards on Ripa Grande. The relief of a beleaguered city,\r\neven as late as the last century when decorous indifference was the\r\nfashionable pose, used to cause deliriously human demonstrations. Men\r\nwere quite as human in the fifteenth as in the nineteenth century, less\r\ncompound, and much more simple. Belgrade was relieved, and there was joy\r\nin Christendom.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn May the Lord Ludovico Scarampi dell’ Arena Mezzarota, Archbishop of\r\nFlorence, Patriarch of Aquileia, Ablegate to the Regno,\r\nCardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San Lorenzo _in Damaso_, was\r\nappointed Admiral of the Pontifical Fleet. Under the Lord Eugenius P.P.\r\nIV, as Commander-in-Chief of the Pontifical Army, he had used Rome at\r\nhis will. Dismissed from office by the Lord Nicholas P.P. V, he had\r\ndevoted himself to luxurious living, and gained the nickname of _the\r\nLord Lucullus_. His haggard but voluptuous profile makes it probable\r\nthat he deserved the name. Seeing the Lord Calixtus P.P. III to be an\r\nold and feeble man, who conceivably might afford him new preferment and\r\na fresh field for his insatiable ambition, he had come to Rome to offer\r\nhis service to the Holy Father. But the stalwart cardinal-nephews, the\r\nLord Luis Juan de Mila y Borja, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santi\r\nQuattro Coronati, and the Lord Rodrigo de Lançol y Borja,\r\nCardinal-Deacon of San Niccolo _in Carcere Tulliano_, distrusted the\r\nprofessions of Cardinal Scarampi. Suspecting his bonafides, they\r\nmentioned their suspicions to their August Uncle, with the result that\r\nhe was forbidden to approach the Vatican. Not to be beaten, Cardinal\r\nScarampi discovered a fervent zeal for the Crusade. There could be no\r\nsurer way into the Pope’s favour. His Holiness considered that this\r\nprelate might devote his enormous fortune to the war-fund; and He lost\r\nno time in receiving him in audience, and naming him Pontifical Admiral.\r\nThe Cardinal-Nephews urged the advisability of flying him with a string;\r\nand therefore his authority was restricted. A man of his fashion and\r\nquality could have put in a fine dignified time ashore. But that would\r\nnot have suited the Cardinal-Nephews; and the Lord Calixtus P.P. III\r\nperceived no signs of the unbuckling of the Cardinal-Admiral’s pouches.\r\nSo they gave him banquets, and his sailing-orders. A fleet of transports\r\nleft the Tiber with five thousand troops aboard: but the\r\nCardinal-Admiral stayed in Rome to assure the Pope’s Holiness that these\r\nwere insufficient for any practical purposes; and that a fleet of thirty\r\ngalleys was absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nThen the strenuous Pontiff remembered that King Don Alonso had promised\r\nto provide Him with such a fleet; and it gently and firmly was intimated\r\nto the Cardinal-Admiral that he might go to Naples and collect the same:\r\nif he failed to go, he had the alternative of facing a judicial inquiry\r\ninto his doings as generalissimo under the Lord Eugenius P.P. IV.\r\nThereon the Cardinal-Admiral scoured away hot-foot for Naples; where he\r\nfound that King Don Alonso the Magnanimous had belied his promises,\r\nhaving sent the ships to settle a little private dispute in which his\r\nMajesty was engaged with the Republic of Genoa. This was bad news for\r\nthe Pope: but it did not alter His determination by the breadth of a\r\nsingle hair. He was quite well-used to the vagaries and magnanimities of\r\nthe King of Naples, whom He had known for more than forty years. He was\r\nequally well-resolved to use the services which the Cardinal-Admiral had\r\nvolunteered. Men had thought Him to be a feeble old man who could be\r\ninfluenced with ease. They found out their mistake. We are accustomed to\r\nthink of youth as fiery and headstrong: but what can bend the will of\r\nfiery headstrong age? His Holiness sent imperative commands to the\r\nCardinal-Admiral that he must make the best of the ships in hand, and\r\nsail for the Ægean Sea, where at least he could help the Crusade by\r\ncreating a diversion among the islands that the Infidels owned there.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alfonso of Aragon_]\r\n\r\nFresh troubles were at hand in Hungary. Round Belgrade, the putrefying\r\ncarcases of the Muslim thousands envenomed the air. The rudiments of\r\nantiseptic sanitation were unknown. Those who have had to do with Boers,\r\nor Cubans, or Filipinos will know the unspeakable horror that this\r\nimplies. Pest decimated the Christian army. Plague swept away the Magyar\r\nhost, that Infidels in vain had tried to overcome. When they told him\r\nthat his end was near, that Viaticum was approaching to be his strength\r\non that dark road which man must tread alone, the noble Vaivod Jan\r\nHunniades, said: “It is not fitting that our Lord should visit his\r\nservant”; and, rising from his death-bed, he dragged himself to the\r\nnearest altar, where, after confession and communion, in the priest’s\r\nhands he fell and yielded up his great and splendid soul, the eleventh\r\nof August 1456. On the twenty-third of October Fra Jan Capistrano also\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nFrom Rome came the voice of the Pope strenuously appealing to the\r\nPowers. His ablegates preached in every country. The common people heard\r\nHim gladly, and responded to His call: but the nobles lent deaf ears.\r\nUpper Germany and Nürnberg equipped battalions of crusaders, which were\r\nincreased by contingents from England and France.\r\n\r\nIn November the faineant young King Wladislaw returned to Hungary, and\r\nvisited the field of Belgrade. Since the death of Jan Hunniades the\r\nCount de Cilly had made himself of supreme authority over his royal\r\nward. Belgrade still was mourning the mighty Vaivod; and the nobles\r\nunder Wladislaw Corvinus, Hunniades’s son, resenting the insolent\r\nassumptions and cowardice of De Cilly, slew him there. The young king\r\nconcealed his wrath, and persuaded the sons of Jan Hunniades to follow\r\nhim to Buda. All unsuspicious of that treachery of which cowards are\r\ncapable they obeyed, and, on arrival in the capital, the Majesty of\r\nHungary had them seized, and Wladislaw Corvinus Hunniades publicly\r\nbeheaded as a traitor. Hungary was now in woeful plight. Deprived by axe\r\nand pest of those strong leaders who had merited her trust, her king a\r\nvenomous child, her throne with no legitimate heir, she waited, in fear\r\nand trembling, to hear again the Infidel thundering at her gate. All\r\ndiscipline was at an end; the Magyar huszars were disbanded, and\r\nreturned to their homes.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Germany, the question of the Magyar Succession was regarded as\r\nconfusion worse confounded; and the Electors of the Empire considered\r\nthe time a suitable one for reapplying the screw to feeble needy Caesar\r\nFriedrich IV, their suzerain.\r\n\r\nThey invited him to preside at a Diet at Nürnberg, on St. Andrew’s Day,\r\n1456; and, indeed, their conduct throughout was thoroughly Caledonian.\r\nTheir ostensible object was the projection of a new crusade; and they\r\nannounced an intention of acting independently if Caesar should refuse\r\nto come. In reality they meant to pit Pope against Emperor, and Emperor\r\nagainst Pope; so that, in the confusion, they might gratify their\r\nprivate ambitions by snatching concessions from one or other of those\r\nPowers. By pretending to desire a new crusade they would gain pontifical\r\nfavour. By taking independent action they would arouse imperial ire. The\r\nPope might be trusted to grant them what they called Ecclesiastical\r\nReform in return for their alliance to His plans against the Infidel.\r\nCaesar might be trusted to concede extension of their political power,\r\nin return for their allegiance to him as suzerain. In either case they\r\nstood to win something.\r\n\r\nCaesar promptly forbade the assembling of the Diet at Nürnberg. His\r\ncommand was slighted; the Diet sat, and was attended by a Papal\r\nAblegate. Purely political discussions ensued; and the Diet adjourned\r\nbefore reaching any conclusion. Then the Elector Albrecht of Brandenberg\r\nfound it worth his while to form a strong Caesarian party; and the\r\nElectors of the papal faction were left in a minority. The cry for\r\nChurch Reform was raised. The Papacy was threatened with what it was\r\nsupposed to dread more than a General Council—viz., a Pragmatic\r\nSanction,[17] _i.e._, a definite assertion of Imperial Supremacy. The\r\nElectors kept their proceedings secret, and little news was allowed to\r\nreach Rome, where the curia was determined to resist in any case.\r\n\r\nThe cry for Church Reform is a popular one. The expression of desire for\r\nthe cultivation and consummation of the Christian Ideal invariably wins\r\nsympathy. It is, perhaps, a little unfortunate that the soi-disant\r\nreformers of the fifteenth century attached to the word Reform a baser\r\nmeaning than that which it bears in the twentieth.\r\n\r\nRome had her champion ready in the Lord Enea Silvio Bartolomeo de\r\nPiccolhuomini, Bishop of Siena, to whom she entrusted the task of her\r\ndefence; and that he might be well-armed with all authority, the Pope’s\r\nHoliness created him Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Sabina.\r\n“No cardinal ever entered the college with greater difficulty than I;\r\nrust had so spread over the hinges (_cardines_, specimen of fifteenth\r\ncentury pun) that the door could not turn and open. Calixtus used\r\nbattering rams and every kind of instrument to force it,” said the new\r\nCardinal of Siena to the Lord Giovanni Castelleone, Bishop and Cardinal\r\nof Pavia. (Pii II. Ep. 195) The Sacred College had not forgiven the Lord\r\nCalixtus P.P. III for the creation of the Cardinal-Nephews; and its\r\npolicy was to oppose God’s Vicegerent and all His works. This new\r\ncreature, too, was credited with liberal proclivities; and the\r\nconservatism of the Italian cardinals was up in arms. The Cardinal of\r\nSiena had been so long a resident in Germany that he was looked upon as\r\nmore a German than Italian, more of a friend to Caesar than to Peter.\r\nAbove all, his transcendent talents and versatility were excessively\r\ndistasteful to mere mediocrity.\r\n\r\nThe adjourned Diet of Nürnberg resumed its session at\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Main. Here it became definitely hostile to Caesar; and,\r\nby announcing its intention to resist the collection of tithe, to the\r\nPope also. It committed the strategical error of uniting its two enemies\r\nby the bond of a single interest. The Lord Calixtus P.P. III instantly\r\nappealed to Caesar Friedrich IV on behalf of the Crusade; and so ended\r\nthe year of grace 1456.\r\n\r\nLet it be conceded that Germany was aggrieved; that there were\r\nengagements unfulfilled by Rome. What then? Rome, and all the world,\r\nknew Germany’s habit of clamouring for Reform, whenever she saw a chance\r\nof being paid for silence. Rome, and all the world, knew that these\r\nclamours only originated with insincere and venal prelates and Electors,\r\nwho would become obsequiously dumb on a sop being thrown to their\r\npersonal interests.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the Electors was the Lord Hans of Baden, Prince-Archbishop\r\nof Mainz. His chancellor, Martin Mayr, in writing congratulations to the\r\nCardinal of Siena on his elevation, took occasion to be very bellicose\r\nabout Papal treatment of Germany. “His Holiness observes neither the\r\ndecrees of the Council of Constance, nor of Basilea, nor the agreements\r\nof His predecessors, but sets the German nation at naught,” he said.\r\n“Our elections of bishops arbitrarily are annulled. Reservations are\r\nmade in favour of cardinals and papal secretaries. You yourself have a\r\ngeneral reservation of benefices in the provinces of Mainz, Trier, and\r\nKöln, to the value of two thousand ducats per annum—an unprecedented and\r\nunheard of grant. Annates rigorously are exacted, grants of expectancies\r\nhabitually are given, and his Holiness is not content with His due.\r\nBishoprics are not given to the most worthy, but to the highest bidder.\r\nFresh tithes are imposed without the consent of our bishops, and are\r\npaid to the Pope. In every way Germany, once so glorious, is used as a\r\nhandmaid. For years she has groaned in slavery. Now her nobles think\r\nthat the time has come to make her free.”\r\n\r\nThis letter reads like a genuine cry of distress. The Cardinal of Siena\r\nwas an adept at dealing with such dishonesty as this, which would\r\ndeceive one less expert. He could read between the lines; and he knew\r\nthis Chancellor Mayr. He began by asserting Papal Supremacy, and\r\nrejecting the decrees of the schismatic Council of Basilea. He agreed\r\nthat the Concordat of the Lord Eugenius P.P. IV should be observed. He\r\nsaid that the Lord Calixtus P.P. III was willing to redress grievances,\r\nif the Electors would send envoys to lay them before Him in proper form.\r\nSo far, nothing could be more satisfactory; and then the Cardinal of\r\nSiena got to work. Papal interference with elections, he said, was\r\npurely judicial intervention, due to the ambition and greed of\r\nclaimants, not to papal rapacity. If any payments had been made by\r\nwould-be bishops to bribe officials of the curia, the said would-be\r\nbishops justly could not blame His Holiness, but their own ambition,\r\nwhich would do anything for its own aggrandisement. Men were not more\r\nangelic in Rome than in Germany: when money was offered they naturally\r\ntook it. But the Holy Father must not be blamed for that. He wished to\r\nstop the extortions of his officials. He Himself received nothing but\r\nHis due. Every one thinks it a grievance to part with money, and will\r\nthink so always. Bohemia made the same complaint against Germany as\r\nGermany made against Rome, that money was drained from the land: yet\r\nGermany, owing to her connection with the papacy, steadily had grown in\r\nwealth and importance, and was richer now than at any previous time,\r\ndespite of her complaints. To descend to personal matters, the Cardinal\r\nof Siena thought it very hard that Chancellor Mayr should object to the\r\nprovisions which had been made in his favour. As poet-laureate of the\r\nEmpire and orator of Caesar he had lived and laboured in Germany so\r\nlong, that he now found it hard to be classed as a stranger. In\r\nconclusion, _he thanked the Chancellor for his personal offer of help to\r\nrealise the said provisions; and would be glad to know of any eligible\r\nbenefices which should fall vacant_.\r\n\r\nThe sting was in the tail of this letter. It is evident that, while\r\nMartin Mayr was writing for publication his precious list of grievances,\r\nhe also was sending to the cardinal in private a second letter offering\r\nhis own services as rent-collector. In theory, he pretended to treat his\r\nconnection with the Lord Enea Silvio as having no existence. In\r\npractice, he was very anxious to be employed as agent on commission. To\r\nsuch a venal Janus only one reply was possible; and the Cardinal of\r\nSiena exposed the worthless insincerity of Germany’s spokesman by\r\nanswering his private and his public letters together on the same sheet.\r\n\r\nThis device, as was intended, provoked a proposition from Chancellor\r\nMayr’s superior, the Prince-Archbishop of Mainz; who sent his secretary\r\nto Rome on the tenth of September, 1456, with plenary powers to\r\nnegotiate with the Cardinal of Siena towards an alliance with the Pope\r\nagainst the Electors. This renegade prelate’s terms were, that he was\r\nprepared to desert the German party of reform, if he were conceded the\r\nright of confirming episcopal elections throughout Germany as the price\r\nof his treachery; a right which would enable him to tax candidates for\r\nbishoprics at his will.\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal of Siena lashed the Prince-Archbishop with courteous but\r\nstinging pen. He rejoiced to hear that his High Mightiness no longer\r\ncared to be allied with those malignants who attacked the Holy Father;\r\nbut regretted that he should ask for that which was a right inherent in\r\nthe Papacy, and which none of his predecessors had enjoyed. No bribe, no\r\nsecret understanding, was necessary between God’s Vicegerent and His\r\nsubjects. All were bound to obey. He was sure that the modesty of the\r\nArchbishop had been misrepresented by this improper request, which he,\r\nfor his part, could not dare to lay before a Pope so blameless and so\r\nupright as was the Lord Calixtus. (Pii II. Ep. 338)\r\n\r\nNow that the venal nature of the cry for reform had been made clear to\r\nall the world, the Cardinal of Siena wrote eloquently and reasonably to\r\nCaesar Friedrich IV, to the King of Hungary, to the Princes and Prelates\r\nof Germany, pointing out the futility of quarrelling with the Pope, from\r\nWhom they derived so many benefits. (Pii II. Ep. 320, 344, 349.) He also\r\nexpanded his letter to the discomfited Chancellor Martin Mayr into a\r\npamphlet called _De ritu, situ, conditione, et moribus Germaniae_, in\r\nwhich he shewed that Germany had received from Rome far more than she\r\never had given. His wise and irrefragable reasoning, with the diplomatic\r\nskill of the papal envoy Lorenzo Rovarella, made Germany pause. To pause\r\nwas to weaken. Then came the death of King Wladislaw of Hungary on the\r\neve of his marriage with Madame Marguerite de France. His dominions in\r\nAustria, Hungary, Bohemia, were claimed by several pretenders. The\r\nGerman Powers became intensely interested. Their attention was diverted\r\nfrom their attempts to blackmail Christ’s Vicar. And so the end of the\r\nLord Calixtus P.P. III was attained; the crisis was averted without\r\nissue of a Pragmatic Sanction.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Cardinal-Admiral was in the Ægean. Being neither hero nor\r\nenthusiast he merely cruised from place to place, making a show of\r\nactivity, capturing a few unimportant islands from the Muslim Infidel,\r\nrelieving the necessities of the Knights of Rhodes. His sole object was\r\nto avoid that judicial inquiry with which the Cardinal-Nephews had\r\nthreatened him; and hence he showed himself as but a perfunctory\r\ncrusader. In fact, his influence was bad; for by giving the Ægean\r\nislanders the notion that Rome was their defender, he lulled them into\r\nfalse security and destroyed their self-reliance.\r\n\r\nThe plight of Eastern Christendom became more hopeless. Only the\r\nHoliness of the Pope, of all the Western powers, took any practical\r\nmeasures. France promised, but failed to keep her word, and would not\r\npay the tithe. The Duke of Burgundy collected the tithe, and kept it.\r\nNorway, Denmark, and Portugal sat still. The Duke of Milan and the\r\nRepublic of Venice disregarded the Pope’s entreaties. The Signoria of\r\nFlorence refused to help Him. A few of the Italian barons, tyrants of\r\npetty fiefs, provided him with money and men. The Republic of Genoa was\r\nloyal; and, in return, the strenuous Lord Calixtus P.P. III protected\r\nGenoese colonies on the Black Sea littoral, and conferred honours on her\r\nnobles. The dark outlook momentarily was lightened by a victory over the\r\nMuslim fleet, in which five and twenty galleys became a Christian spoil.\r\nIt must be recorded that it was solely the determination, foresight, and\r\nenergy, with which the aged Pontiff in Rome personally directed naval\r\nmovements, which inspired His sailors to achieve this triumph. Had the\r\nCardinal-Admiral Scarampi been endowed with the plenary authority which\r\nhe had desired, very much less enterprising and successful would have\r\nbeen the policy of the papal fleet.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt but that German captiousness prevented the\r\naccomplishment of the Pope’s designs for the protection of the Oriental\r\nChristians. Skanderbeg had but a handful of huszars wherewith to oppose\r\nthe Muslim Infidel. And there was no encouragement for him; for the\r\napathy of Caesar and the Powers prevented him from following up his\r\nvictories. The King of Naples was as a thorn in the Pope’s eye. He had\r\nhoped for better things of His old patron who had brought Him to Italy;\r\nand He was bitterly enraged by King Don Alonso’s treachery in sending\r\nthe fleet, which, though constructed in the port of Naples, had been\r\npaid for with papal gold, to carry on a private quarrel with a Christian\r\nPower, the Republic of Genoa, at the very moment when Christendom was in\r\nthe direst peril from the Infidel.\r\n\r\nThe forbearance of the Lord Calixtus P.P. III ended there, as far as\r\nNaples was concerned. Henceforward He relentlessly opposed the policy of\r\nKing Don Alonso, especially his scheme for an alliance with Milan by\r\nwhich he hoped to make doubly sure the succession of the Bastard\r\nFerrando, whose legitimation had been recognised by two preceding\r\nPontiffs.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1458, György Podiebrad renounced the Hussite heresy\r\non his election to the throne of Bohemia. King György made no difficulty\r\nabout swearing allegiance to the Holy See; and he also promised to take\r\nthe cross of the Crusade. Considering that his dominions immediately\r\nwere menaced by the Infidel, his policy would appear to have been\r\ndictated by reasons of state rather than by religious zeal.\r\n\r\nThe Holiness of the Pope was consoled by this accession to the thinned\r\nranks of His allies. He hoped that the example of King György would be\r\nof good effect to the Bohemian heretics; for spiritual matters are not\r\nuninteresting to a Roman Pontiff. It seemed that the occasion might be\r\nused to bring the powers into line; and He summoned a congress to meet\r\nin Rome, whose object was the Unity of Christendom. Pious men have\r\npursued that object ever since—the religious unity. In the days of the\r\nLord Calixtus P.P. III, political unity was the aim desired, and\r\nstriven-for again, in vain.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the Crusade, the work nearest to the Pope’s heart was the\r\npromotion of His nephews’ interests. Why He should never have done\r\nanything for His own most charming son remains a historical mystery. The\r\nelevation to the cardinalate of Don Luis Juan de Mila y Borja, and of\r\nDon Rodrigo de Lançol y Borja, already has been recorded. There was a\r\nyounger brother of Cardinal Rodrigo, younger by a year and a half, Don\r\nPedro Luis de Lançol y Borja, a gorgeously beautiful sneak and coward,\r\nto whom the Pope extended the envious admiration that feeble age must\r\nfeel for youth and strength; and for whom nothing had been done. The\r\nLord Calixtus P.P. III, though quite independent of the good opinion of\r\nthe Sacred College, did not cause a second storm by raising this young\r\nman, also, to the purple. He himself preferred a secular career; and it\r\nwas thought that the hot blood of Borja suited him to cut a military\r\nfigure. On that account, his Uncle, in the capacity of an Italian\r\ndespot, named him Duke of Spoleto, Gonfaloniere of the Holy Roman\r\nChurch, Castellan of all pontifical fortresses, and Governor of the\r\ncities of Terni, Narni, Todi, Rieti, Orvieto, Spoleto, Foligno, Nocera,\r\nAssisi, Amelia, Civita Castellana, Nepi, and of the Patrimony of St.\r\nPeter in Tuscany,—an extravagance of generosity which is justifiable\r\nsolely on the score of goodwill towards His family, which, after long\r\nyears, an octogenarian was able to put into effect. Of course there\r\narose the usual uproar of protest from the Sacred College, led by the\r\nLord Domenico Capranica, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Croce\r\n_in Gerusalemme_; and something akin to a riot among the citizens of\r\nRome, who always hated foreigners, and especially Catalans. For the idea\r\nhad got abroad in Spain that in Rome preferment awaited Spaniards, and\r\nthither they flocked to receive the good gifts which, they imagined, a\r\nSpanish Pope would have in store. Rome was furious at this immigration;\r\nbut Borja made overtures of friendship to Colonna, and treated the\r\nRomans to a display of Spanish arrogance. As for the strenuous Lord\r\nCalixtus P.P. III, He announced His defiance of public opinion by\r\ninstalling Don Pedro Luis de Lançol y Borja in the Prefecture of the\r\nCity, an act which involved the surrender into Borja hands of the Mola\r\nof Hadrian, or Castle of Santangelo, the impregnable fortress on Tiber\r\nwhich dominates Rome. Don Pedro Luis was looked upon by Orsini as a\r\nmortal foe, on account of his displacing Don Giovantonio Orsini in this\r\nPrefecture. Thus the inimical relations of Borja with Orsini very\r\nnaturally qualified them for an alliance with Colonna, in a simple age\r\nwhen a man’s friends were his friend’s friends, and his enemies his\r\nfriend’s enemies; and Colonna was the most powerful house in Rome. A\r\nnursery ditty of the period will show in what esteem Colonna was held:\r\n\r\n                 “Che possa avere cinque figli maschi,\r\n                 “E tutti quanti di Casa Colonna,\r\n                 “Uno Papa, l’altro cardinale,\r\n                 “Ed uno arcivescovo di Colonia,\r\n                 “Ed uno possa aver tanta possanza\r\n                   “Da levar la corona al re di Franza\r\n                 “E l’altro possa aver tanto valore\r\n                   “Da levar la corona all’ imperatore.\r\n\r\nSo, for a brief space, the Eternal City became absolutely an appanage of\r\nthe House of Borja. Catalans pervaded the streets, engaged in robbery\r\nand murder. The intimidated Conservators (equivalent to a modern\r\nmunicipal council) servilely thanked the Pope for the appointment of His\r\nnephew, and even suggested that Don Pedro Luis should be made King of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-seventh of June 1458 died King Don de Alonso Aragona, The\r\nMagnanimous, of Naples, the Two Sicilies, and Jerusalem. The Lord\r\nCalixtus P.P. III at once refused to acknowledge His quondam pupil, the\r\nBastard Ferrando, as successor; and impetuously threatened to plunge\r\nItaly into war, by declaring on His Own account a claim to the Regno as\r\na fief of the Holy See.\r\n\r\nA favourite policy of ecclesiastical persons of all ranks, and in all\r\nages, appears correctly to be summarised by Patrizzi in this\r\nformula:—_Advance pretensions and presently they will become realities_.\r\nThe Pope’s Holiness desired to benefit Don Pedro Luis. If His claim, as\r\nsuzerain of the Regno, could be substantiated, then He would be able to\r\ncrown Don Pedro Luis as its King. It was an extensive and important\r\ndomain, including the whole of Southern Italy, the Abruzzi, Apulia, and\r\nCalabria, with the Three-Tongued[18] Island of Sicily. From a commercial\r\nstand-point, the Pope’s action was distinctly smart and business-like.\r\nAnd there was this further consideration:—Supposing that the Bastard\r\nFerrando were strong enough to make resistance, at least some part of\r\nthe Regno would have to be sacrificed as a concession for the sake of\r\npeace; and so a fief could be created for Don Pedro Luis, who, in any\r\ncase, stood to win. Failing the Regno, it was the Pope’s intention\r\nstrenuously to press the reconquest of Constantinople, and to crown His\r\nnephew King of Cyprus and Emperor of Byzantium. As an earnest of His\r\ngoodwill He lost no time in naming him Lieutenant of Benevento and\r\nTarracina within the Neapolitan boundary, confirming him in this post by\r\nBrief of the thirty-first of July 1458.\r\n\r\nIn Rome indignation knew no bounds. It was plain that these strong young\r\nmen, the pontifical nephews, were, after the Crusade, all-powerful with\r\nthe Ruler of the World. The city seethed with jealousy and revolt,\r\nattacking anything in the shape of a Catalan on sight. Spaniards, rash\r\nenough to show themselves in the streets, courted assassination. As for\r\nthe Pope, age and mortal sickness seemed to fan the flame, to white\r\nheat, of His inflexible imperious will. The Cardinal of Santa Croce _in\r\nGerusalemme_ was banished to distant embassages, and threatened with\r\nimprisonment if he again broke silence, on account of the protest which\r\nhe made. The Apostolic Prothonotary, Fra Bernadino Caravajal was sent to\r\nGermany. The Cardinal-Admiral Scarampi was kept at sea. Cardinal Latino\r\nOrsini and his faction fled into exile. Only four of the Most\r\nIllustrious preserved their loyalty to the Pope and the\r\nCardinal-Nephews; these were:—The Roman Lord Prospero Colonna,\r\nCardinal-Deacon of San Giorgio _in Velum Aureum_; the Venetian Lord\r\nPietro Barbo, Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria Nuova; the French Lord\r\nGuillaume d’Estouteville, Cardinal-Bishop of Porto; and the Sienese Lord\r\nEnea Silvio Bartolomeo de’ Piccolhuomini, Cardinal-Presbyter of the\r\nTitle of Santa Sabina. Profiting by the temporary absence of opposition,\r\nthe Holiness of the Pope gave the Bishopric of Lerida to His nephew,\r\nCardinal Luis Juan of Santi Quattro Coronati; and to Cardinal Rodrigo of\r\nSan Niccolo _in Carcere Tulliano_ he gave the Vicechancellorship of the\r\nHoly Roman Church.\r\n\r\nAt last, the Bastard of Naples decided on his course of action; and\r\nsummoned the Neapolitan nobles, demanding their acceptance of him as\r\ntheir king. He made no claim upon the kingdoms of Aragon, Valencia, and\r\nCatalonia, in Spain; nor upon Sardinia, the Balearic Islands, and\r\nSicily, which King Don Alonso had left by will to his own brother, King\r\nDon Juan of Navarre: but for the crown of Naples and the Sovereignty of\r\nthe Order of the Stola, which his father had founded, he was prepared to\r\nfight. Further, in defence of his right, he appealed from the Pope to a\r\nGeneral Council—a stupid enough proceeding, but one of the customs\r\npeculiar to aggrieved personages of the Borgian Era. Incidentally, it\r\nmay be mentioned that the Lord Calixtus P.P. III, was not the only\r\ndisputant of Don Ferrando’s claim. Even supposing that the right of King\r\nRéné of Anjou were set aside, he had a third rival in the shape of his\r\ncousin Don Carlos of Biana, son of King Don Juan of Navarre.\r\n\r\nThe Pope knew well that, though He might disturb the peace of Italy, He,\r\nsingle-handed, could not hope to triumph in a war with Naples; and He,\r\ntherefore, tried to win over Don Francesco Sforza-Visconti, Duke of\r\nMilan, who, after the Cardinal of Siena, was the greatest and most\r\nfar-seeing statesman of his time. Duke Francesco answered shortly and\r\nsharply, that the Neapolitan Succession had been settled by the Lord\r\nNicholas P.P. V to the satisfaction of all Italian princes, and that he\r\nintended to fight for King Don Ferrando I. sooner than see his country\r\ndevastated by civil war.\r\n\r\nThis last bitter disappointment caused the collapse of the Pope’s\r\nhealth. With the summer heat plague appeared in Rome. The Lord Calixtus\r\nP.P. III lay in the throes of fever; and Orsini took up arms against all\r\nCatalans in open war. Of the Pontifical Nephews the layman showed the\r\nwhite feather; the stalwart cardinals were staunch. Don Pedro Luis de\r\nLançol y Borja, as Prefect of Rome, sold the Mola of Hadrian to the\r\nSacred College for two and twenty thousand ducats; and fled from the\r\ncity, escorted by his Catalans. The Cardinal of Venice helped him to a\r\nboat on Tiber, by which means, owing to the darkness of the night, he\r\nreached Civita Vecchia in safety, having avoided Orsini who watched for\r\nhim at the gates of Rome. On the 26th of September, says Lo Spondano,\r\nsuddenly he died.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the claims of the church is that of a Divine Promise of Her\r\nMaintenance until the end of the world. It is interesting to the student\r\nof history to notice that, from time to time, Her responsible\r\nauthorities comport themselves as though they had no faith in the\r\nvalidity of that prediction. They seem to think that its fulfilment\r\nsolely depends upon their own exertions. The strange conviction of the\r\nnecessity of his present existence, which is innate in the ordinary man,\r\nis perhaps the explanation of the extraordinary expenditure of energy to\r\navert death, to invalidate the most fervent and frequent professions of\r\nbelief in The Life Of The World To Come, to consolidate human\r\ninstitutions and human plans, which obtains on such occasions as the\r\nclose of a prelacy or the end of a pontificate. If it be true that\r\nactions speak louder than words, then the confusion attendant on a\r\nPope’s death must tell a sorry tale.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth of August 1458 the Lord Calixtus P.P. III lay dying in the\r\nVatican. Rome was in a turmoil. Colonna and Orsini were sharpening their\r\nswords. The banished cardinals were hurrying back for the ensuing\r\nConclave. The four loyal cardinals were fortified in their palaces. Only\r\nthe Cardinal-Nephews attended at the Pope’s bedside.\r\n\r\nThe curious privilege which was accorded to these last, at this period,\r\ncould not be exercised in the present case. By the very conditions of\r\ntheir juniority in the Sacred College, added to the powerful influence\r\nwhich they were supposed to hold over the reigning Pontiff, the\r\nCardinal-Nephews were the objects of intense dislike (to put it mildly)\r\non the part of their colleagues. Their elevation was an offence; their\r\nenrichment, a matter for envy; their indifference to opinion, a matter\r\nfor positive hatred. The only consolation to the other cardinals,\r\ncreatures of previous Pontiffs, which their situation held, was that it\r\nmust end with the demise of their creator. When their Pontifical Uncle\r\nceased to live in this world, the Cardinal-Nephews sank at once to their\r\nproper place in the Sacred College. Under these circumstances, the said\r\nCardinal-Nephews were used to make their hay while yet the sun was\r\nshining, to avail themselves of their opportunities for securing a\r\nsatisfactory future, as junior cardinals, by the acquisition of\r\nproperty, real estate, benefices, jewels, or money, at the pleasure of\r\nthe Pope. And when their time was drawing near its close, when their\r\nAugust Uncle was entering His last agony, it was the custom for the\r\nCardinal-Nephews to plunder the apostolic palace of any valuables which\r\nalready had not passed into their hands. This privilege was their last\r\nchance; for, at the instant of the Pontiff’s death, the\r\nCardinal-Chamberlain assumes possession as representative of the curia;\r\nand, in an age when self aggrandisement was not less a ruling passion\r\nthan at the present hour, the practice was at least connived at, on the\r\nprinciple that every dog should be allowed to have its day.\r\n\r\nBut, on the present occasion, there was no plundering by the\r\nCardinal-Nephews. The fury of the Romans against all Spaniards made it\r\nexpedient for them to avoid the risk of a journey across the City, to\r\ntheir palaces, encumbered by the mules which bore their spoils. This\r\nwould seem to be the human explanation of their presence in the Vatican,\r\nwhile the Orsini faction made havoc of the Catalans, and despoiled all\r\nwho bore arms in the Borgo or pontifical Region of Rome.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe learned Dr. Creighton has well said that men of decided opinions and\r\neminent ability who come to their power late in life, spend the\r\naccumulated passion of a lifetime in the accomplishment of long\r\ncherished desires. The Lord Calixtus P.P. III would come into that\r\ncategory.\r\n\r\nThough He was unenthusiastic regarding the Renascence of Letters and the\r\nArts, and checked the tremendous schemes of His predecessor, yet He was\r\nby no means inattentive to the duties involved by His position. He\r\nrestored the palace and church of Santi Quattro Coronati, because He had\r\noccupied them during His cardinalate. He improved the church of San\r\nSebastiano _extra muros_ above the Catacomb of San Calixto, in honour of\r\nthe saint from whom He took His papal name. He repaired the church of\r\nSanta Prisca, and began the new roof of the Liberian Basilica on the\r\nEsquiline. He employed the painters, who did not leave Rome on His\r\nelection, in painting banners for the Crusade. The Vatican school of\r\narras-weavers, founded by the Lord Nicholas P.P. V, was continued, and\r\nflourished exceedingly under His benevolence. He created nine cardinals\r\nin the course of His short pontificate. The Porporati of the Consistory\r\nof the twentieth of February 1456 were named on p. 36. At the Consistory\r\nat Christmas the same year, He elevated to the purple:—\r\n\r\n  (α) The Lord Rainaldo Pisciscello, the virtuous and learned Archbishop\r\n        of Naples, as Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Cecilia:\r\n\r\n  (β) Don Juan de Mella, brother of the celebrated Franciscan Frat’\r\n        Alonso de Mella, and a noble of Spain, Auditor of the Ruota to\r\n        the Lord Martin P.P. III, as Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of\r\n        Sant’ Aquila e Santa Prisca:\r\n\r\n  (γ) The Lord Giovanni Castelleone, patrician of Milan, Legate to\r\n        Caesar Friedrich IV, and Bishop of Pavia, as Cardinal-Presbyter\r\n        of the Title of San Clemente:\r\n\r\n  (δ) The Lord Giacomo di Collescipoli Teobaldi, a Roman citizen, as\r\n        Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Anastasia:[19]\r\n\r\n  (ε) The Lord Richart de Longueil Olivier, Bishop of Constance,\r\n        Archpriest of the Vatican Basilica, one of the judges at the\r\n        Rehabilitation of Madame Jehanne de Lis, the Maid of Orleans, as\r\n        Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Sant’ Eusebio:\r\n\r\n  (ζ) The Lord Enea Silvio Bartolomeo de’ Piccolhuomini, as\r\n        Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Sabina.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Calixtus P.P. III has no share in the evil reputation which has\r\nbeen cast upon His House. The worst that has been said of Him is, that\r\nHe was obstinate, irritable, and inspired no affection. They were\r\ndisappointed suitors who so spoke. The Pope’s Holiness used Himself ever\r\ngently to the poor and needy, who found in Him a good samaritan. His\r\nbenefactions to the hospital of Santo Spirito have been recorded. In His\r\nwill He left five thousand ducats to found a hospital in His\r\ncardinalitial palace of Santo Quattro Coronati. His private life was one\r\nof rigid piety, simplest habits, apostolic fervour. He left one hundred\r\nand fifty thousand ducats in the Pontifical Treasury, which He had\r\ncollected for the Holy War.\r\n\r\nBut the whole force of His resourceful and masterful character was\r\nconcentrated upon the Crusade, and the settlement in life of His beloved\r\nnephews. On those two points He would brook no opposition. With the\r\nviolent impetuosity of age, of Spanish blood, He was inflexible,\r\noverbearing, inconsiderate, on all matters connected with these\r\nprojects. All the ardour, and all the zeal, which He devoted to the\r\ndelivery of Christendom from the Muslim Infidel, was doomed to fail. The\r\nMuslim Infidel defiles Constantinople now. But His dealings with His\r\nnephews produced more permanent results.\r\n\r\nYet “it must always be an honour to the Papacy that, in a great crisis\r\nof European affairs, it asserted the importance of a policy which was\r\nfor the interest of Europe as a whole. Calixtus and his successor[20]\r\ndeserve, as statesmen, credit which can be given to no other politicians\r\nof the time. The Papacy, by summoning Christendom to defend the limits\r\nof Christian civilisation against the assaults of heathenism, was\r\nworthily discharging the chief secular duty of the office.” (Creighton.)\r\n\r\nThe Lord Calixtus P.P. III died on the sixth of August 1458, in the\r\nfourth year of His reign; and was buried by four priests in the crypt of\r\nthe old Basilica of St. Peter-by-the-Vatican.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Kindling\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the junior branch of the House of Borja (which\r\noriginated in Don Ricardo de Borja, second son of Don Pedro, Count of\r\nAybar, Lord of Borja, who died in 1152), emigrated to the kingdom of\r\nNaples, where it became naturalised, and softened its name into the\r\nItalian Borgia.

III, was Cardinal Rodrigo, of the age of twenty-seven\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nHis position was a precarious one; and it is perfectly amazing that he\r\nwas not forced to follow his cousin, the Cardinal de Mila, into\r\npermanent retirement. That he was able, not only to remain in Rome but\r\nto carve out for himself a unique career there, undoubtedly is due to\r\nthose superb talents and alert vigour of character which have made him\r\nsuch a prominent figure in history.\r\n\r\nHe had only two friends in Rome, the Cardinal Enea Silvio of Siena and\r\nthe Cardinal-Archdeacon Prospero Colonna. Quite unmoved by the hatred of\r\nthe other Purpled Ones, he entered the Conclave of 1458 for the election\r\nof the new Pope, with no such stupid thing as a plan of action; but with\r\na determination to comport himself so, according as opportunities arose,\r\nas to improve his position and his prospects. It was impossible to know\r\nbeforehand what steps he would have to take: he could be guided only by\r\ncircumstances. To a young man of such temper the gods send\r\nopportunities. There arrived a deadlock in the Conclave; and of that\r\ndeadlock Cardinal Rodrigo seized the key.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are five ways by which a Pope may be elected:—\r\n\r\n  (α) By Compromise—_i.e._, when the cardinals appoint a committee of\r\n        themselves with power to name the Pope:\r\n\r\n  (β) By Inspiration—_i.e._, when a number of cardinals put themselves\r\n        to shout the name of some cardinal, as “The\r\n        Cardinal-Prior-Presbyter is Pope,” or “The Cardinal-Archdeacon\r\n        is Pope;” by which method of shouting other voices are\r\n        attracted, and the minimum majority (of two-thirds plus one)\r\n        attained:\r\n\r\n  (γ) By Adoration—_i.e._, when the minimum majority (of two-thirds plus\r\n        one) of the cardinals go and adore a certain cardinal:\r\n\r\n  (δ) By Scrutiny—_i.e._, when each cardinal secretly records a vote:\r\n\r\n  (ε) By Accession—_i.e._, when, the scrutiny having failed to give the\r\n        minimum majority (of two-thirds plus one) to any cardinal, the\r\n        opponents of that cardinal, whose tally is the highest, shall\r\n        accede to him.\r\n\r\nIn the Conclave of 1458 the method of Compromise was not used, and no\r\ncardinals were moved to proceed by Inspiration or to Adoration. Votes\r\nwere taken by the Scrutiny, which revealed an extraordinary state of\r\nthings. The French Cardinal d’Estouteville had a certain number of\r\nvotes; the Cardinal Enea Silvio of Siena had a higher number; but\r\nneither had the minimum majority. The cardinals sat upon their green or\r\npurple thrones, beneath their green or purple canopies, watching and\r\nwaiting for a sign.\r\n\r\nThen the young Cardinal-Vicechancellor Rodrigo de Lançol y Borja rose up\r\nand proclaimed: “I accede to the Lord Cardinal of Siena.” His friend and\r\nally, the Cardinal-Archdeacon Prospero Colonna, followed him: “I accede\r\nto the Lord Cardinal of Siena.” Cardinal Teobaldi, who, as a Roman\r\ncitizen, followed Colonna, said also: “I accede to the Lord Cardinal of\r\nSiena.” The three lowered their green and purple canopies. They were in\r\nthe presence of the Pope, in Whom all authority resides, before Whom\r\nnone may remain covered. The minimum majority had been attained. The\r\nLord Enea Silvio Bartolomeo de’ Piccolhuomini, sometime Caesar’s\r\nambassador in “the horrible and ultimate Britains” (Scotland), sometime\r\npoet-laureate, novelist, historian, bishop, and cardinal, had become the\r\nLord Pius P.P. II.\r\n\r\nBy this act, which practically gave the proud triregno to his friend,\r\nthe Cardinal-Vicechancellor put himself into high favour with the new\r\nPontiff, Whose enchanting temperament delighted in the brilliance and\r\naptitude of the Borgia, and made his future the object of especial\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMaterials for the history of Cardinal Rodrigo during this reign are but\r\nscanty, in the absence of opportunities for original research. In 1459,\r\nhe went a-holiday-making with the Lord Pius P.P. II, on a triumphal\r\nprogress through Florence; where the Holy Father chatted with a lovely\r\nboy of seven years, called Lionardo da Vinci, bastard of a Florentine\r\nnotary and a contadina. They visited Siena; and Corsignano, where the\r\nPope’s Holiness was born, which He was pleased to rename Pienza, in\r\nhonour of His papal name, and to build there a cathedral, an episcopal\r\npalace, and the Piccolhuomini palace for His Own family on the three\r\nsides of the public square. By way of showing His confidence in the\r\nVicechancellor-Cardinal-Archdeacon (Archdeacon _vice_ Cardinal Prospero\r\nColonna), perhaps, also, to curb, with useful employment, the exuberance\r\nof manlihood which had been giving evidence of revolt against the\r\nconvenances, the Lord Pius P.P. II left the superintendence of these\r\nbuildings in the hands of Cardinal Rodrigo, who has not scrupled to\r\nadorn their façades with the armorials of the House of Borgia, _Or, a\r\nbull passant gules on a field flory vert, within a bordure gules semée\r\nof flammels, or_.\r\n\r\nVicechancellor-Cardinal-Archdeacon Rodrigo had lived the life of a\r\ngallant handsome prince and man of the world of the fifteenth century,\r\nin no wise differing from his antitype of the twentieth. The Renascence\r\nhad brought about an age when sensuousness degenerating into sensualism\r\nwas found in prominent places. It is difficult to see what else was to\r\nbe expected. “Ye can not serve God and Mammon.” Learning and art\r\nessentially, radically, and necessarily are antagonistic to\r\nChristianity, hard though that saying may be found. Towards them the\r\nChurch’s policy always has been a policy of compromise. “You may learn\r\nthe wisdom of the world, but you may not learn all,” She says; trying to\r\nserve God, paltering the while with Mammon. “Nudus, Nudum Christum\r\nsequens” went Beato Fra Francesco when he renounced the world; and the\r\nChurch compromises with St. Sebastian for Phoibos Apollon. Therefore, as\r\nlong as Grace and Nature are served up on the same dish, it is stupidly\r\nunreasonable to hold up holy hands in horror when high ecclesiastical\r\ndignitaries happen to comport themselves like human beings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fridericus IV. Emperor._]\r\n\r\nThe twentieth century is no whit more chaste than the fifteenth, and can\r\nill afford to cast a stone. Nor was the fifteenth century the stew of\r\nuniversal depravity which some would have us believe it to have been. It\r\nwas unmoral as the twentieth is immoral. But there were pure and\r\nmaid-white souls then, as there are now; and the difference between the\r\nfifteenth century and the twentieth is a mere difference of fashion.\r\nNow, we pretend to be immaculate; then, they bragged of being vile. Much\r\nof the literature of the fifteenth century is most suitably presented in\r\nthe original. Poets and historians, especially historians, allowed\r\nlittle scope for exercise of the imagination. The convention of\r\nconcealment, of suggestion, had not been invented. Messeri Stefano\r\nInfessura and Benedetto Varchi rank among the most eminent chroniclers\r\nof their day; certainly the Latin of the one, and the Tuscan of the\r\nother, would serve for models: but a complete unbowdlerised translation\r\nof the former’s Journal of Roman Affairs (_Diarium Rerum Romanum_), or\r\nof the latter’s Florentine History (_Storia Fiorentina_), incontinently\r\nwould be suppressed by the police. Yet it would be absurd to conclude\r\nthat these writers, or others of their kidney, have given a just account\r\nof the morals of their age. “The divorce court and the police news do\r\nnot reflect the state of morality in England. No more do Juvenal’s\r\nSatires give us a complete or impartial picture of Roman society. We\r\nmust read side by side with them the contemporary letters of Pliny,\r\nwhich give a very different picture, and also weigh the evidence offered\r\nby inscriptions.” (E. G. Hardy. Satires of Juvenal, p. xliv.) That is\r\nthe spirit in which the student of the fifteenth century should approach\r\nhis task. He will read all, and hear all sides, and form his own\r\nconclusion, which, at best, must be a faulty one, until the secrets of\r\nall hearts are known.\r\n\r\nThe Vicechancellor-Cardinal-Archdeacon was a human being. If he were, as\r\nGaspar Veronensis describes him at a later date, “a comely man, of\r\ncheerful countenance and honeyed discourse, who gains the affections of\r\nall the women he admires, and attracts them as the loadstone attracts\r\niron,” what must he have been in the glow of his superb youth? This is\r\nnot by any means a suitable reputation for a churchman; and only its\r\nnon-singularity prevents it from being a disgraceful one. Viewed from a\r\ntheological stand-point, Cardinal Rodrigo’s carnal lusts are, of course,\r\nwholly indefensible: but this work is an attempt at the study of certain\r\nhuman beings prominent in history; and not a theological treatise nor an\r\nact of the _advocatus diaboli_. The Lord Pius P.P. II has said, “If\r\nthere are good reasons for enjoining celibacy of the clergy, there are\r\nbetter and stronger auguments for insisting on their marriage”; and that\r\nSupreme Pontiff was far and away the wisest and most observing man of\r\nHis Own (or perhaps of any) time.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is suggested that, knowing of the proclivities of Cardinal\r\nRodrigo, being in truth his firm friend, desirous that he should live up\r\nto the obligations of his rank, and, above all, actuated by a sense of\r\nduty as Christ’s Vicar, the Pope’s Holiness set him to supervise the\r\nbuildings at Pienza—to keep him out of mischief.\r\n\r\nIn 1460 was born Don Pedro Luis de Borja, bastard of the said\r\nCardinal-Archdeacon and a spinster (soluta). The child was openly\r\nacknowledged and honourably reared.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Lord Pius P.P. II wrote a letter, to remonstrate\r\nwith Cardinal Rodrigo and with the Lord Giacopo Ammanati,\r\nCardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San Crisogono, concerning their\r\ndivergences from ecclesiastical discipline. It is a genial and paternal\r\nletter, in which frank hatred of Sin is displayed with affection for the\r\nsinners. Cardinal Rodrigo replied, correcting some mis-statements of\r\nfact: but, that the Pope’s Holiness was not satisfied, appears from a\r\nsecond letter of a firmer and more admonitory nature. Much has been made\r\nof this correspondence by some writers, whose pose is to think\r\nungenerously of ecclesiastics. It should be noted, however, that the\r\nLord Pius P.P. II took exception to certain long visits which those\r\ncardinals paid to ladies of their acquaintance, and to nothing more.\r\nApparently there was nothing more of which to complain; and the fact\r\nthat the Pope’s Holiness should deem these visits to be indiscretions on\r\nthe part of ecclesiastics, goes to prove rather the extreme and strict\r\nsolicitude of the Holy Father for the spiritual welfare of his flock,\r\nthan any dissolute conduct of the two cardinals. But the defamers of\r\nCardinal Rodrigo misrepresent the said visits in the worst possible\r\nlight, as nocturnal orgies and debaucheries; and long night visits\r\nobviously would constitute a grave and serious scandal. The\r\nmisrepresentation very likely is due to careless ignorance. The fact is,\r\nthat the Italian method of computing time in the fifteenth century is\r\ndeceptive to the superficial student. Something is known of the dials of\r\nItaly which count the hours up to 24 o’clock; and when it is said that\r\nCardinal Rodrigo paid visits to ladies in their gardens “from the 17th\r\nto the 22nd hour,” instantly cynical carelessness predicates nocturnal\r\norgies. But when it is understood that, in the fifteenth century, the\r\nfirst hour began at half an hour after sunset, and that the visits took\r\nplace in time of summer, it will be realised that Cardinal Rodrigo\r\nsimply went to the mid-day dinner, and left his friends an hour and a\r\nhalf before sunset: which may have been indiscreet, but certainly was\r\nnot essentially criminal, as some would have us believe. But when the\r\ncareless or wilful calumniator sets out to ruin a reputation, he finds\r\nit an easy thing to twist a fault into a crime.\r\n\r\nThe Vicechancellor-Cardinal-Archdeacon is recorded to have astonished\r\nRome with the splendour of the arras adorning the outside of his palace\r\non the Festival of Corpus Domini, 1461. The buildings at Pienza occupied\r\nhim through 1462. Of 1463 there is no history with which he is\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\nIn 1464 “an aged man, with head of snow and trembling limbs,” took the\r\nrose-red cross in the Basilica of St. Peter at Rome. This was no other\r\nthan the Sovereign Pontiff, the Lord Pius P.P. II, unique in all\r\nhistory, Who, as an example to the apathetic potentates of Christendom,\r\nwent, dying as He was, a crusader against the Muslim Infidel. Cardinal\r\nRodrigo was in attendance upon His Holiness in that terrible journey in\r\nparching summer heat across Italy to the Adriatic; where, while waiting\r\nfor the fleet, at Ancona, in August, the Lord Pius P.P. II died.\r\nCardinal Rodrigo, stricken by fever there, unable to return to Rome for\r\nthe Conclave, was obliged to forego his official privilege as\r\nCardinal-Archdeacon, the crowning of the Lord Paul P.P. II on the\r\nsixteenth of September.\r\n\r\nThis Pontiff (lately the Lord Pietro Barbo, Cardinal of Venice) wished,\r\non His election, to take the name Formosus, in allusion to His handsome\r\nperson. It was a naïve age, when men hid neither their vices nor their\r\nvirtues; and the story possibly may be true: but it is very likely to be\r\none of the spiteful little distortions of motive, which ecclesiastics of\r\nall ages are wont to ascribe each to other. The Popes, after the first\r\nsix centuries, have never shown much originality in choosing Their\r\npontifical names, and generally fall back upon the name of one of Their\r\nimmediate predecessors. At present the changes are rung upon Pius, Leo,\r\nand Gregory; the fifteenth century had a wider range: but many of the\r\nlovely old names, such as Anacletus, Fabian, Felix, Silvester, Hadrian,\r\nVictor, Evaristus, were buried in oblivion. It is far more kind to\r\nsuppose that the Lord Cardinal of Venice had the idea of reviving the\r\nbeautiful name of the Lord Formosus P.P., Who reigned from 891 to 896,\r\nand was the hundred and twelfth Pope from the Lord St. Peter P.P.\r\nPersuaded against this course by the cardinals, He spent two hundred\r\nthousand fiorini d’oro on a triregno set with sapphires; built St.\r\nMark’s Palace (Palazzo Venezia) at the end of the Corso in Rome; and\r\ninstituted carnival races of riderless horses (called Bárberi, as a pun\r\nupon his name), and of Jews heavily clothed in garments of thick wool\r\nand stuffed to the throat with cake. In 1467 was born Madonna Girolama\r\nde Borja, bastard of the Vicechancellor-Cardinal-Archdeacon, by an\r\nunknown mother. The child was openly acknowledged and honourably reared.\r\nDuring this reign Cardinal Rodrigo remained in favour; and, on account\r\nof his fine presence and habitude to curial manners, he was chosen to\r\nreceive, at Viterbo, Caesar Friedrich IV, The Pacific, coming on a\r\nstate-visit to the Pope in 1469.\r\n\r\nAt the death of the Lord Paul P.P. II, Cardinal Rodrigo de Lançol y\r\nBorja, Cardinal Guillaume d’ Estouteville, and Cardinal Ioannes\r\nBessarione were the only foreigners in the Conclave of 1471. Once more\r\nthe Vicechancellor-Cardinal-Archdeacon was clever enough to put a Pope\r\nunder an obligation, by leading an accession to Cardinal Francesco della\r\nRovere, who thereby was elected, and chose to be called the Lord Xystus\r\nP.P. IV. All the chroniclers save one allege that this Pope owed His\r\nelection to the accession of Cardinals de Borja, Orsini, and Gonzaga of\r\nMantua, who reaped rich rewards in the shape of benefices and\r\npreferments. The Pope’s Holiness gave to Cardinal Rodrigo the wealthy\r\nAbbey of Subjaco _in commendam_; who left a memorial of his abbatial\r\ntenure in the tower which he added to the castle of Subjaco, where the\r\narmorials of the House of Borgia still remain. The last official act of\r\nCardinal Rodrigo, as Archdeacon of the Holy Roman Church, appears to\r\nhave been the coronation of the Lord Xystus P.P. IV on the twenty-fifth\r\nof August 1471. After that he was ordained priest, and consecrated\r\nbishop, and elevated to the rank of Cardinal-Bishop of Albano, one of\r\nthe seven sub-urban sees. He continued to hold the Vicechancellorship;\r\nand, in this capacity, he built for himself in Rome a palace on Banchi\r\nVecchi, which, even in that sumptuous epoch, excited extravagant\r\nadmiration. A little less than a third of it is now the huge Palazzo\r\nSforza-Cesarini on Piazza Sforza-Cesarini, nearly opposite to the\r\nOratory, called Chiesa Nuova. Since the unification of Italy in 1870, a\r\nnew wide street (Corso Vittoremanuele) has been driven through the city,\r\nnecessitating the demolition of more than two-thirds of Cardinal\r\nRodrigo’s building, and the construction of an undistinguished modern\r\nfaçade on the modern street: but the remaining courts, whose frontage is\r\nstill on Banchi Vecchi, are more or less _in statu quo_. The history of\r\nthe passing of this palace into the hands of Sforza-Cesarini belongs to\r\na later page.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-third of December 1471 Cardinal Rodrigo was sent as Legate\r\n_a latere_ to Spain, to preach a new Crusade against the Muslim Infidel.\r\nIt is a curious thing that while he was unpopular in Italy on account of\r\nhis Spanish origin, he was unpopular also in Spain where they considered\r\nhim an Italian; a most ridiculous confusion, for Don Rodrigo de Lançol y\r\nBorja was a pure Spaniard by birth, descent, aspect, character, tastes,\r\nand habit, and so continued until his life’s end, in no way influenced\r\nor modified by his long residence in Italy. During his absence, the Lord\r\nXystus P.P. IV built the Xystine Chapel of the Vatican; and called to\r\nRome, from the gardens at Florence of Lorenzo de’ Medici his patron, the\r\nvivacious and bizarre Messer Alessandro Filipepi (nicknamed Botticelli),\r\nwondrous pupil of Fra Lippo Lippi, of Masaccio, of Beato Giovangelico da\r\nFiesole, to decorate its walls with frescoes _in tempera_, the colours\r\nof which are mixed with the yelks of country-laid eggs for the deeper\r\ntints, and of town-laid eggs for the paler tints, according to the rules\r\nof Messer Cennino Cennini who wrote in 1437. In 1471 the bronze antique,\r\nknown as _Il Spinario_, was found on the Capitol.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Lord Rodrigo de Lançol y Borja, now Cardinal-Bishop\r\nof Porto, Vicechancellor of the Holy Roman Church, and of the age of\r\nthree and forty years, maintained irregular relations with Madonna\r\nGiovanna de’ Catanei, a Roman lady, born the thirteenth of July 1442,\r\nand of the age of thirty-two years, wife to one Don Giorgio della Croce.\r\nWhether her husband was used to trade in his wife’s favours (like the\r\ncriminal who, as late as 1780, was marched through Rome wearing a\r\npasteboard mitre labelled _cornuto voluntario contento_), is a matter\r\nfor conjecture. But, in 1474, Madonna Giovanna gave birth to a son, Don\r\nCesare, who is called Borgia; and it is claimed that Cardinal Rodrigo\r\nwas his father. As far as historical research has gone, no evidence has\r\nbeen found to prove that Cardinal Rodrigo ever directly denied\r\npaternity; and, as he was undoubtedly deeply in love with Madonna\r\nGiovanna, and intimate with her during ten subsequent years, it is\r\nprobable that his reticence was actuated by kindly feelings. But there\r\nis a very strong suspicion that another cardinal, in every way the\r\nnotorious and life-long rival of Cardinal Rodrigo, was the father of\r\nthis child; and many mysterious historical inconsistencies would be\r\nexplained by the establishment of the truth of this suspicion. However,\r\nfor the present, merely the birth in 1474 of Don Cesare (detto Borgia)\r\nis recorded, and the question of his paternity will be examined at a\r\nproper place.\r\n\r\nIn 1475 Madonna Giovanna de’ Catanei bore, to Cardinal Rodrigo, Don Juan\r\nFrancisco de Borja, to whom (after the death in 1481 of Don Pedro Luis\r\nde Borja) his father ever gave the honours and the affection which are\r\ndue to an eldest son and heir. This is the most important circumstantial\r\nevidence against Don Cesare’s right to the name of Borgia.\r\n\r\nIn January of the same year, Cardinal Rodrigo was deputed, with a nephew\r\nof the Lord Xystus P.P. IV, one Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, who, as\r\na lad, had peddled onions in a boat between Arbisola and Genoa, to\r\nwelcome King Don Ferrando I of Naples at Tarracina, on the occasion of\r\nhis state-visit to the Holy See. Three days later, Cardinal Rodrigo said\r\nmass for his Majesty at San Paolo _extra muros_ when the king was\r\nleaving for Colonna’s fief at Marino, where English envoys from King\r\nEdward IV Plantagenet, who had just conferred the Most Noble Order of\r\nthe Garter upon Duke Francesco Sforza-Visconti of Milan, were waiting\r\nwith a similar attention for the King of Naples.\r\n\r\nOn the tenth of June 1476 the plague appeared in Rome, and the Lord\r\nXystus P.P. IV, attended by Cardinal Rodrigo, removed His court to\r\nViterbo, where cooler air lessened the danger of contagion.\r\n\r\nIn 1478 was the hideous Conspiracy of the Pazzi at Florence, which\r\ncreated no small stir in all Italy. Also in this year Madonna Giovanna\r\nde’ Catanei bore, to Cardinal Rodrigo, Madonna Lucrezia Borgia.\r\n\r\nOn the first of October 1480, “Xystus, Bishop, Servant of the servants\r\nof God, to His beloved son Cesare (de Borja), a scholar of the age of\r\nsix years,” sent “greeting and the Apostolic Benediction,” and dispensed\r\nhim from the necessity of proving the legitimacy of his birth; a rule\r\nwhich must be observed (in the absence of a dispensation) by whoever\r\nshall wish to become eligible for ecclesiastical benefices.\r\n\r\nIn 1481 died Don Pedro Luis de Borja, the eldest bastard of the\r\nVicechancellor-Cardinal Rodrigo. He was of the age of twenty-one years,\r\nand betrothed to a mere child, the Princess Doña Maria de Aragona. Also,\r\nin 1481, Madonna Giovanna de’ Catanei bore, to Cardinal Rodrigo, Don\r\nGioffredo Borgia.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fourth of January 1482, Madonna Girolama Borgia, bastard\r\nof the Vicechancellor-Cardinal by an unknown mother, was married, at the\r\nage of fifteen years, to Don Giovandrea Cesarini, scion of a Roman\r\nbaronial house of Imperial origin. The same year, on the sixteenth of\r\nAugust, the Lord Xystus P.P. IV named Cardinal Rodrigo administrator of\r\nall benefices that should be conferred upon Don Cesare (detto Borgia)\r\nuntil the latter reached the age of fourteen years. There is a second\r\nbrief of this date, from “Xystus, Bishop, Servant of the servants of\r\nGod, to His beloved son Master Cesare (de Borgia),” naming the child\r\nCanon of Valencia and “Our Notary”; little bits of preferment producing\r\nsufficient revenues for his education. These three briefs relating to\r\nDon Cesare, are found in the Secret Archives of the Dukes of Osuña and\r\nInfantado, whose line was extinguished in 1882 at the death of Don\r\nMariano (v. suggested genealogical tree).\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1484 died the Lord Xystus P.P. IV, and the Genoese Cardinal Cibo\r\nascended the papal throne under the title of the Lord Innocent P.P.\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nDuring the six and twenty years that had elapsed between the death of\r\nthe Lord Calixtus P.P. III and the accession of the Lord Innocent P.P.\r\nVIII, the position of the Vicechancellor-Cardinal Rodrigo considerably\r\nwas changed. Then, he was a young man with only two friends; a junior\r\nCardinal-Deacon surrounded by a host of enemies. Now he was in his ripe\r\nmaturity, senior member of the Sacred College, Dean of the\r\nCardinal-Bishops, Vicechancellor of the Church, powerful enough to be\r\nable to command as many friends as he might choose to have—and rich\r\nenough to buy; rich beyond the richest of that rich age, from the\r\nrevenues of his numerous benefices; and in rank second only to the Pope\r\nHimself. To such a man, with the paramount ambition and magnificence of\r\nCardinal Rodrigo, only one thing in all the world remained for him to\r\ndo. He deliberately set himself to capture the triregno.\r\n\r\nThere is no chronicle of his history during the eight years’ reign of\r\nthe Lord Innocent P.P. VIII. Evidently he withdrew himself from the\r\npublic life of the curia, from the splendour of legations, to nurse his\r\nrevenues, to ingratiate himself with those who, in the next Conclave,\r\nwould have the crowning or the crushing of his hopes. With the wisdom of\r\nthe serpent and the harmlessness of the dove he was to build his house:\r\nbut, first, like the prudent man, he counted the cost. Cardinal Rodrigo\r\nwas far too polished a diplomatist, far too keen a man of business, to\r\nneglect long and meticulous preparation. He perfectly knew his\r\ncentury—indeed, as an organiser, he would have been illustrious in any\r\ncentury—; and, with wisest generalship, he made ready his forces against\r\nthe striking of the hour for action. The smoothness with which the\r\nmachinery ran in the Conclave of 1492, makes it plain, to the least\r\nexperienced student of human affairs, that a master-mind had designed\r\nthe gear, to ensure a minimum of friction and an exact performance.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn September 1484 the Lord Innocent P.P. VIII named Don Cesare (detto\r\nBorgia), who was now of the age of ten years, Treasurer of the Cathedral\r\nof Cartagena (Carthago Nova).\r\n\r\nIn 1485, the year of the supposed murder in England of King Edward V\r\nPlantagenet and of his brother Duke Richard of York, there died in Rome\r\nDon Giorgio della Croce, husband of Madonna Giovanna de’ Catanei. On the\r\nseventh of June 1486 she married Don Carlo de Canale, a noble of Mantua,\r\nand from this time her irregular relations with Cardinal Rodrigo ceased.\r\nIn an age when trade was not considered disgraceful, except for\r\npatricians, when even the greatest artists kept shops (not studios by\r\nway of compromise, but regular shops, _botteghe_, like the blacksmiths\r\nor the cobblers), it is not shocking to know that Madonna Giovanna owned\r\nan inn in the Region of Ponte. This does not mean that she performed the\r\nduties of a female boniface. She was a very great lady, bien-vue in\r\nRoman society, with a lovely villa near San Pietro _ad Vincula_; but she\r\ncertainly drew a comfortable income from the Lion Inn (Albergo di\r\nLeone), opposite the Tordinona, in the Via del Orso, which was then a\r\nstreet of inns for foreigners. The Tordinona, from whose upper window\r\ndangled a permanent and generally tenanted noose for evildoers, has now\r\ndisappeared: but the cavernous cellars of the Lion Inn, formerly filled\r\nwith wine on which, by pontifical favour, no tax was levied, remain\r\nexactly as they were when the Spanish cardinal’s mistress was their\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nDeprived of the society of Madonna Giovanna de’ Catanei, Cardinal\r\nRodrigo, in the fifty-fifth year of his age, amused himself with the\r\nhigh-born maiden, Madonna Giulia Farnese, nicknamed in Rome _La Bella_,\r\nwho was betrothed and afterwards married to Don Orso Orsini, himself of\r\nBorgian descent (v. suggestion for a genealogical tree). A faded\r\nrepresentment of her marvellously brilliant beauty may be seen in the\r\nmannered fresco by Messer Bernardo Betti (detto Pinturicchio) in the\r\nBorgia Tower of the Vatican, where she was painted as Madonna; or on the\r\ntomb of her brother Alessandro (afterwards the Lord Paul P.P. III) in\r\nthe Basilica of St. Peter, where she was sculptured in marble by Messer\r\nGuglielmo della Porta as a naked Truth (clumsily draped, after an\r\nerotomaniac Spanish student of theology had taken the statue for\r\nLucian’s goddess Kuthereia). The fruit of her early intrigue with\r\nCardinal Rodrigo was Madonna Laura, detto Orsini, born in 1489, and\r\nadopted by Don Orso Orsini, the husband of Madonna Giulia.\r\n\r\nThe reign of the Lord Innocent P.P. VIII is notable for the extreme of\r\nlawlessness into which lax government had let Rome fall. The Sovereign\r\nPontiff was a family man, Who openly acknowledged the paternity of seven\r\nbastards, and Whose chief concern appears to have been their settlement\r\nin life. A son, Don Franciotto Cibo, a silly avaricious weakling, He\r\nmarried to Madonna Maddalena, daughter of Lorenzo de’ Medici; His\r\ndaughter He married to Messer Gheraldo Usodimare, a rich merchant of\r\nGenoa; the wedding-feast took place at the Vatican, the Pope’s Holiness\r\npresiding; and so the world was made to lose sight of the high ideals of\r\nthe Papacy, as exemplified by the Lord Pius P.P. II, and to regard the\r\nSupreme Pontiff in the light of a mere monarch, a mere man. Cardinal\r\nPiero Riario, in 1473, had bargained with Duke Galeazzo Maria\r\nSforza-Visconti of Milan to create him King of Lombardy, in return for\r\nmoney and troops, by the aid of which he himself might ascend the papal\r\nthrone, his uncle, the Lord Xystus P.P. IV being willing to abdicate in\r\nhis favour: and, but for the sudden death of Cardinal Piero, this\r\nabominable scheme would not have lacked completion.\r\n\r\nNicholas had been a scholar and a gentleman; Calixtus, a zealous\r\nstrenuous champion of an impractical cause; Pius, a gentle saintly\r\ngenius and skilful statesman; Paul, a noble figure-head; Xystus, a\r\nplebeian nepotist; and Innocent was a lethargic paterfamilias. Naturally\r\nthe condition of a kingdom, under such a series of sovereigns\r\n(considering the Popes in their temporal, and not in their spiritual\r\ncapacity), would go from bad to worse.\r\n\r\nYet Letters and the Arts were flourishing, as in the golden reign of the\r\nLord Nicholas P.P. V. Canon Angelo Ambrogini (detto Poliziano) was\r\nshowing, in his fine hymn _In Divam Virginem_, that it is possible to\r\nwrite Christian verse in Latin good as Golden; and in his ‘Ερωτικὸν\r\nΔωριστί and Ἐρωτικὸν περι του χρυσοκομου that a clergyman of the\r\nfifteenth century, whose Greek was not learned at school or college,\r\ncould indite as dainty verses as Theokritos. Can the twentieth century\r\nvisualise the fifteenth? Can the twentieth century realise how poor the\r\nfifteenth was in material which every board-school boy may have to-day\r\nfor the asking? The title of the book “De Omnibus Rebus et Quibusdam\r\nAliis,” provokes a guffaw now. Then it was used in sober earnest; for,\r\nthen, it was possible for one man to know all that was known—so little\r\nwas there known in the fifteenth century. Dante Alighieri knew all, at\r\nthe beginning of the fourteenth. Lionardo da Vinci knew all at the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth—literally all. Go and look at his manuscript\r\nnote-books, and see what divers things he knew, to what depth of\r\nknowledge he had delved, how ingenious an application he made of the\r\nwisdom that he had gained; his inventions of conical bullets, of boats\r\nwith paddle-wheels, of flying machines, of a cork-apparatus for walking\r\non water. Consider that he was machinist, engineer, architect, and\r\nmathematician, constructor of artillery, fortifications, canals, and\r\ndrains; and that, incidentally, he painted pictures, the lost “Cenacolo”\r\nat Milan, which the whole world knows—lost, because Messer Lionardo made\r\nthe experiment of painting fresco in oil. Mark, too, in the note-books,\r\nhow artfully and easily he wrote from right to left, to keep his\r\nknowledge from vulgar superficial eyes that pried. Mark his fluent\r\ngesture, his decisive master-strokes, and the little illuminating\r\ndiagrams with which he illustrated every page. Can the twentieth century\r\nunderstand that the Italian mind of the fifteenth, in the absence of\r\nmaterial, was concentrated on workmanship? Hence the marvels of\r\nhandicraft which we use for models now, carving, metalwork, and textile\r\ndesign. The workmanship was everything then, in Art and in Letters also.\r\n“So long as the form was elegant, according to their standard of taste,\r\nthe latinity copious and sound, the subject-matter of a book raised no\r\nscruples. Students of eminent sobriety, like Guarino da Verona, thought\r\nit no harm to welcome Boccadelli’s _Hermaphroditus_ with admiration;\r\nwhile the excellent Nicholas V. spent nine days perusing the filthy\r\nsatires of Filelfo.” (_Symonds’ Renascence_ II. 574.) The workmanship\r\nwas everything. The civilisation of the fifteenth century was as high as\r\nthat of the twentieth, in conception and production of the beautiful.\r\nBut clearly let it be realised that “civilisation has nothing to do with\r\nmorality or immorality”; that “great reformers generally destroy the\r\nbeautiful”; that “high civilisation is generally immoral.” The age of\r\nthe Renascence, which found nothing shameful in the profession of the\r\nἑταίρα (if we may judge from the epitaph of one, _Imperia, Cortisana\r\nRomana, quae digna tanto nomine, rarae inter homines formae specimen\r\ndedit. Vixit a. XXVI. d. XII. Objit MDXL. die XV. Aug._), though free\r\nfrom the hypocrisy engendered by the German Reformation of a later date\r\n(which the maxim “Si non caste tamen caute” so admirably describes), was\r\nfrankly and unblushingly unmoral, as far as a proportion of its leaders\r\nwas concerned. Yet its unmorality was kept within certain bounds, and\r\ncircumscribed by a force which, now, is no restraint. Printing was in\r\nits infancy. Written books were few, and very costly. In Milan, a city\r\nof two hundred thousand inhabitants, there were only fifty copyists. Not\r\ntill 1465, in the reign of the Lord Paul P.P. II, was there a\r\nprinting-press in Italy, at Subjaco in the Sabine Hills; while Florence\r\nhad no press till 1471. And, at first, printed books were regarded with\r\ndisfavour by reason of their cheapness. One rich man said that he would\r\nbe ashamed to have them in his library, as now a rich man would be\r\nashamed to have Brummagem electro instead of hall-marked silver. Yet, by\r\nmeans of ambulant printers, who printed only one page at a time on a\r\nhand-press in a mule-cart (and who were the pioneers of that curse to\r\nreal civilization, the printed book), before 1500 no fewer than 4987\r\nworks had been printed in Italy alone. Here again the fifteenth century\r\npassion for perfect workmanship came into play. Look at an Aldine\r\nClassic, and mark its exquisite form. Messer Aldo Manuzio of Venice set\r\na great artist, Messer Francesco Raibolini (detto II Francia), who\r\npainted the dulcet Pietá in the National Gallery, to cut a fount of type\r\nafter the lovely handwriting of the poet Petrarch. That is the Aldine,\r\nor original Italic type; the script of a fourteenth-century singer. Can\r\nthe twentieth century, with its manifold appliances, its labour-saving\r\nmachinery, better that handiwork, or approach that design; or would a\r\nRoyal Academician condescend to cut types for a printer! Look at the\r\nportrait-medals and pictures of the day to see of what fashion were\r\nthese elaborately simple men of the fifteenth century:—The English type,\r\nsturdy, recondite, and simple; the French type, simple and light and\r\nvain; the Italian, subtle and simple and strong—an English Hospitaller,\r\na French cardinal, an Italian scholar called, The Phoenix of Genius;\r\nJohn Kendal, Grand Prior of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem in\r\nEngland; Cardinal-Archbishop Georges d’Amboise; and Messer Giovanni Pico\r\ndella Mirandola; on their medals in the British, and Victoria and\r\nAlbert, Museums. The painters of this era, after Giotto, had emancipated\r\nthemselves from the domination of the Church. They refused any longer to\r\nbe bound by that decree of the Council of Nicaea (a.d. 787), which\r\ncalmly, inexorably, and altogether justifiably ordained:—_It is not the\r\ninvention of the painter which creates the picture; but an inviolable\r\nlaw, a tradition of the Church. It is not the painter, but the holy\r\nfathers, who have to invent and dictate. To them, manifestly, belongs\r\nthe composition; to the painter, only the execution._ The fifteenth\r\ncentury was the century of broken bonds—bonds of discipline, bonds of\r\nmorality. Men tasted liberty, had discovered Man; and, like schoolboys\r\nbreaking bounds, playing truant, dazed in some rich orchard, they\r\nrevelled and rollicked among fruits hitherto forbidden, potentialities\r\nlong-dormant now alive. Unaccustomed sight had yet but imperfect\r\nimpressions. Men saw “men as trees walking”; but as far as they went the\r\nimpressions were vivid, life-like, true. Study the mercilessly precise\r\ndrawings of Cavaliere Andrea Mantegna, the Lombard, pupil of Squarcione,\r\nwho painted for the Lord Innocent P.P. VIII that chapel on the Belvedere\r\nwhich was destroyed by the Lord Pius P.P. VI, and who won his knighthood\r\nby painting for the Marquess Don Francesco de Gonzaga of Mantua. Study\r\nthe works of Messer Luca Signorelli, “the first and last painter except\r\nMichelangelo to use the body without sentiment, without voluptuousness,\r\nwithout any secondary intention whatsoever, as the supreme decorative\r\nprinciple” (_Symonds’ Renascence_); who, having had killed at Cortona\r\nhis young and splendid son, stripped the body naked, and, with iron\r\nnerve, painted from it during a day and a night, “that he might be able,\r\nthrough the work of his own hand, to contemplate that which nature had\r\ngiven him, but which an adverse fortune had taken away.” (_Vasari._)\r\nAbove all, study Messer Alessandro Filipepi (detto Botticelli), who,\r\nhaving finished the chapel of the Lord Xystus P. P. IV, was back again\r\nin Florence, painting for Lorenzo de’ Medici. How many of the Medici he\r\nput into his pictures we never shall know; but if ever a painter painted\r\nfrom the life Alessandro Filipepi was that painter; and, with a little\r\nsympathetic ingenuity, one can trace at least a single precious portrait\r\nthrough his pictures, and into the pictures of another and more\r\nconventional painter; and, in this way, learn what like was one very\r\nprominent personality of the Borgian Era, as παίς, μειράκιον, σιδεύνης,\r\nἐφήβος, ανδρός· Study the angel-boys and San Giambattista in the round\r\nMadonna of the National Gallery and the round Coronation of Madonna at\r\nthe Uffizi. Study the Hermes Ptenopedilos in the Primavera that\r\nBotticelli painted on the verses of Lucretius Carus (737–740) as a\r\nsetting for a portrait of an unknown lady of the House of Medici. And\r\nstudy the limber San Sebastiano at Berlin. Then study murdered\r\nGiuliano’s bastard, the Lord Giulio de’ Medici, Archbishop of Florence,\r\nKnight of St. John of Jerusalem, and Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria _in\r\nDomnica_, in the portrait of the myopic Lord Leo P.P. X by Messer\r\nRafaele Sanzio da Urbino. So shall a lean, muscular, vivid, thoughtful,\r\npious, unmoral, voluptuous yet hardy, typical, young Italian of the\r\nBorgian Era be clearly, intimately, seen and known. And the medals:—Note\r\nhow that the medallists have not learned to flatter or idealise; that,\r\nwhat they saw in their model, that they chiselled in perennial bronze.\r\nNote the character, the distinguished individuality, here preserved; the\r\nSforza medals, for example, with their clean, compelling, vigorous,\r\nvenomous, Greek profiles, which that illustrious House got (and\r\npreserves to this day in Prince Guido Sforza and his sister Princess\r\nCarolina Corsini) from Countess Polissena Russa of Montalto, who married\r\nDuke Francesco. Observe, from their manner of clothing him, how these\r\npeople worshipped Man. Not for them was the concealment of his grace in\r\ndented fractured cylinders. Every natural line must be preserved, every\r\ncontour displayed, in that age of unconventional realism. The frescoes\r\nof Messer Bernardo Betti (detto Pinturicchio), in the cathedral library\r\nof Siena, are said to be the fashion-plates of the day and month\r\n(1503–1507), done by an eminent artist. And the fabrics of which they\r\nmade their clothes were fine and simple; for the uses of shoddy were not\r\nknown. Sumptuous brocades, fairest linen of flax, furs from the East,\r\nand delicate enduring leather, adorned those men and women who had not\r\nlearned to change their garments as often as they changed their minds;\r\nand who went to bed at night simply as nature made them. That they were\r\nmeticulously clean, is witnessed by the embossed basins and ewers for\r\nfrequent washings, the hanging lavabo on the wall of every room (when\r\nwashing was a ceremonial habit), the elaborate supplies of water, the\r\nbaths of macerated sweet herbs, glasswort, white lily, marsh-mallow, and\r\nlupin-meal, alkaline, mucilaginous, emollient, demulcent, which were the\r\nsubstitute for soap. Care for the personal appearance was extreme.\r\nLittle signs show this. For example, the twentieth century man,\r\nconfection of his hosier and his tailor, plays with watch-chain, stick,\r\nor card-case; the writer, hesitating over the turning of a phrase or\r\nwaiting for the just word, rolls a cigarette; the painter, considering\r\nan effect, dabbles in a tobacco-jar and lights a pipe. Man has a natural\r\ncraving to employ his hands. In similar situations, Messer Lionardo da\r\nVinci’s model and studio-boy, the curly-headed Salaino, would bring\r\nrosewater and towel to refresh his master’s fingers; Canon Angelo\r\nAmbrogini (detto Poliziano) would take out an ivory comb and comb his\r\nlong straight hair; and a dandy anxiously would study his image in\r\npolished metal mirrors set like bosses on his dagger sheath, or chew\r\ncomfits of coriander-seeds, steeped in marjoram vinegar and crusted with\r\nsugar, to bring a special commodity to the memory. In an age when\r\npersonal and private functions were pursued after the methods of cats or\r\ndogs according to the temperament of the pursuer, when that which is now\r\ncalled sanitation was unknown, great and incessant efforts in the way of\r\ncleanliness were imperative; and he who insistently displayed, who\r\npublicly exhibited, his cleanly habits, naturally enjoyed the\r\nconsideration and approval of his equally modish contemporaries. And\r\nthey were practically pious too, these hardy ardent exquisites, who shed\r\nan enemy’s blood as remorselessly as though murder were a natural\r\nfunction. They would weep real tears of devotion over the drama of the\r\nPassion of our Divine Redeemer enacted in the ruined Colosseo of Rome;\r\nand, afterwards, zealously adjourn with knives to the houses of known\r\nJews, or perfervidly hunt the dark lanes of the city for any of the\r\naccursed race who was so misguided as to show his yellowpatched jerkin\r\non the street. The Venetians had a penchant for holy relics, and deemed\r\nno sacrifice too great for increasing their collection. In 1455, the\r\nrepublic made a bid of ten thousand ducats for the Seamless Coat, now at\r\nTreves, and ordained days of humiliation when the offer was refused. The\r\nDoge of Venice was obliged officially to assist at twelve public\r\nprocessions in each year. To please the piety and vanity of Florence,\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici personally applied to the city of Spoleto for the\r\ncorpse of the painter Fra Lippo Lippi; but Spoleto answered that it had\r\nnone too many ornaments as a city, especially in the shape of the\r\ncadavers of distinguished people, and begged to be excused. “The men of\r\nthe Renascence were so constituted that, to turn, from vice and cruelty\r\nand crime, from the deliberate corruption and enslavement of a people by\r\nlicentious pleasures, from the persecution of an enemy in secret, with a\r\nfervid and impassioned movement of the soul to God, was nowise\r\nimpossible. Their temper admitted of this anomaly, as we may plainly see\r\nfrom Cellini’s autobiography.” (_Symonds’ Renascence._)\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Lord Innocent P.P. VIII made no impression on His age; as a despot,\r\nHe was an accented failure. “The Patrimony of St. Peter would be the\r\nmost delightful country in the world if it were not for Colonna and\r\nOrsini,” said the Sieur Philippe de Comines, Orator of the Christian\r\nKing Louis XI of France. The States of the Church became a seething\r\ncauldron of lawlessness and licence. Rome herself, “where everything\r\nthat is shameful or horrible collects and is practised” (_Tacitus_),\r\nswarmed with assassins, professional and amateur. Every man who valued\r\nhis personal safety put on a mail-shirt when he left his naked bed, and\r\nset no foot in the streets till he had buckled a sword, or at least a\r\ndagger, by his side. The very perfection of these fifteenth century\r\nmail-shirts, which could be hidden in two hands, and yet were proof\r\nagainst a thrust or cut at closest quarters, tells its own tale. The\r\ntrade of an armourer became an honourable art and mystery, when men\r\nstaked their lives at every turn, as men callously stake money now on\r\ntheir convictions or opinions. A whole embassage from Maximilian, King\r\nof the Romans, as the heir of Caesar Friedrich IV was styled, was\r\nassailed by brigands and stripped to the shirts in sight of Rome.\r\n\r\nIn July 1492 the Lord Innocent P.P. VIII showed signs of decay, the\r\nfeebleness of age increased, and He was only kept alive by women’s milk.\r\nModern chroniclers of His last hours have fallen into serious error, in\r\nrelating that the operation for transfusion of blood was performed by a\r\nHebrew chirurgeon upon the Holiness of the Pope without accomplishing\r\nits end. The error arises from forgetfulness of the facts: (α) that the\r\nidea of the operation for transfusion could not occur to any one to whom\r\nthe circulation of the blood was unknown; (β) that the phenomenon of the\r\ncirculation of the blood was not discovered by Harvey until the\r\nseventeenth century. Before the circulation of the blood was known, the\r\nvisible veins were taken for sinews. Verrochio thought them to be sinews\r\nwhen he carved them on the lean young arms of his alert David. The blood\r\nwas conceived of as stagnant in the flesh; the heartbeats as a pulsing\r\nof the bowels. If the idea of transferring blood from a healthy to a\r\nfeeble body had occurred to any one of them, the ordinary fifteenth\r\ncentury chirurgeons would not have been contented with a single\r\nincision, but would have filled up the weak body through numerous\r\napertures, to be closed with the red hot cautery as usual; and the\r\npatient most certainly would have died under the operation, of syncope,\r\ncaused, not by loss, but by acquisition of blood. Modern historians have\r\nmisunderstood the words with which Infessura and Raynaldus describe the\r\ndeath of this Pope: and their misunderstanding further is caused by a\r\ncasual and superficial knowledge of the pharmacy of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. Infessura and Raynaldus say that a certain Jewish physician\r\npromised to the Pope’s Holiness the restoration of His health; that he\r\ntook three boys of the age of ten years, giving to them a ducat a-piece,\r\nsaying that he wished to restore the Pope’s health, and that he required\r\nfor that purpose a certain quantity of human blood, which must be young;\r\nthat he drew all the blood out of those three boys; that the said boys\r\nincontinently died; that, when the Lord Innocent P.P. VIII knew, He\r\nexecrated the crime of the Jew and gave order for his arrest; that the\r\nJew had taken himself by flight out of the reach of the torturers; and\r\nthat the Pope received no cure. This, Dr. Mandell Creighton and Mr. John\r\nAddington Symonds call transfusion of blood. They appear to be unaware\r\nof the fifteenth century passion for sublimation and distillation: and\r\nthey appear to have missed this sentence of Raynaldus, _ut ex eo_ (the\r\nyoung blood) _pharmacum stillicidium chimica arte paratum propinandum\r\nPontifici conficeret_; which plainly shows that it was a draught, a\r\ndrink,[21] the quintessence of the boys’ blood, prepared by his\r\nalchymical art, with which the Hebrew physician was going to fail to\r\nsave the life of the Pope.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese were the times, and the men, which the Vicechancellor-Cardinal\r\nRodrigo de Lançol y Borja had to deal.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =Book the Second=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           The Roaring Blaze\r\n\r\n “_A fire that is kindled begins with smoke and hissing, while it lays\r\n hold upon the faggots; bursts into a roaring blaze with raging\r\n tongues of flame, devouring all in reach_;\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of this book has furnished occasion for liars of all\r\nages—reckless liars, venal liars, raving liars, careless liars, clever\r\nliars, and futile liars, to perform their functions.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Innocent P.P. VIII died on the twenty-fifth of July 1492. The\r\nLord Rafaele Galeotti Sansoni-Riarjo, Cardinal-Deacon of San Giorgio _in\r\nVelum Aureum_, Cardinal-Chamberlain of the Holy Roman Church, sent\r\nguards to seize and hold the gates of Rome. _Caporioni_, priors of the\r\nfourteen Regions, patrolled the city to deal with seditions and\r\ndisorders. Patarina, the great bell on Capitol, that only tolls when the\r\nPope is dead, knelled unceasingly.\r\n\r\nAt this time the Sacred College consisted of seven and twenty cardinals.\r\nFour of these were absent in distant sees, and were unable to reach the\r\nEternal City in the nine days at their disposal. They were:—\r\n\r\n  (α) The Lord Luis Juan de Mila y Borja, Cardinal-Prior-Presbyter of\r\n        the Title of Santi Quattro Coronati;\r\n\r\n  (β) The Lord Pedro Gonsalvo de Mendoza, Cardinal-Presbyter of the\r\n        Title of Santa Croce _in Gerusalemme_;\r\n\r\n  (γ) The Lord André Spinay, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San\r\n        Martino _in Monte t.t. Equitii_;\r\n\r\n  (δ) Frère Pierre d’Aubusson, Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes,\r\n        Cardinal-Deacon of Sant’ Adriano.\r\n\r\nTwenty-one cardinals entered the Conclave. They were:—\r\n\r\n  (α) The Lord Rodrigo de Lançol y Borja, Cardinal-Bishop of Porto and\r\n        Santa Rufina, Dean of the Sacred College, Vicechancellor of the\r\n        Holy Roman Church, etc.;\r\n\r\n  (β) The Lord Giovanni Michele, Cardinal-Bishop of Praeneste, Bishop of\r\n        Verona;\r\n\r\n  (γ) The Lord Oliviero Carafa, Cardinal-Bishop of Sabina, Archbishop of\r\n        Naples;\r\n\r\n  (δ) The Lord Giorgio Costa, Cardinal-Bishop of Albano.\r\n\r\n  (ε) The Lord Antoniotto Pallavicini, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title\r\n        of Sant’ Anastasia;\r\n\r\n  (ζ) The Lord Girolamo Basso della Rovere, Cardinal-Presbyter of the\r\n        Title of San Crisogono, Bishop of Recanata;\r\n\r\n  (η) The Lord Domenico della Rovere, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of\r\n        San Clemente, Archbishop of Taranto;\r\n\r\n  (θ) The Lord Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of\r\n        San Pietro _ad Vincula_;\r\n\r\n  (ι) The Lord Paolo Fregosio, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San\r\n        Sisto, Archbishop of Genoa;\r\n\r\n  (κ) The Lord Giovanni de’ Conti, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of\r\n        San Vitale, Archbishop of Consano;\r\n\r\n  (λ) The Lord Giangiacomo Sclafenati, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title\r\n        of San Stefano _in Monte Celio_, Bishop of Parma;\r\n\r\n  (μ) The Lord Ardicino della Porta, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of\r\n        San Giovanni e San Paolo, Bishop of Alba;\r\n\r\n  (ν) The Lord Lorenzo Cibo, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa\r\n        Cecilia, Archbishop of Benevento;\r\n\r\n  (ξ) The Lord Francesco de’ Piccolhuomini, Cardinal-Archdeacon of Sant’\r\n        Eustachio, Archbishop of Siena;\r\n\r\n  (ο) The Lord Rafaele Galeotti Sansoni-Riarjo, Cardinal-Deacon of San\r\n        Giorgio _in Velum Aureum_, Cardinal-Chamberlain of the Holy\r\n        Roman Church;\r\n\r\n  (π) The Lord Giovanni Colonna, Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria _in\r\n        Aquiro_;\r\n\r\n  (ρ) The Lord Giambattista Orsini, Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria\r\n        _Nuova_;\r\n\r\n  (σ) The Lord Giovanni de’ Medici, Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria _in\r\n        Domnica_;\r\n\r\n  (τ) The Lord Giovanni Savelli, Cardinal-Deacon of San Niccolo _in\r\n        Carcere Tulliano_;\r\n\r\n  (υ) The Lord Giambattista Zeno, Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria _in\r\n        Portico_;\r\n\r\n  (φ) The Lord Ascanio Maria Sforza-Visconti, Cardinal-Deacon of San\r\n        Vito e San Modesto _in Macello_, Martiri.\r\n\r\nAt the last moment, before the Conclave finally was immured, there\r\ncame:—\r\n\r\n  (χ) Fra Mafeo Gheraldo, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San Nereo e\r\n        Sant’ Achilleo, Patriarch of Venice;\r\n\r\n  (ψ) The Lord Friderico Sanseverini, Cardinal-Deacon of San Teodoro.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth of August 1492, this Conclave of twenty-three cardinals\r\nlistened to the preliminary exhortations of Fra Bernardino Lopez de\r\nCaravajal, and the business of election was begun.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMan mercifully has been left unable to foresee the effect which his\r\nactions will have upon the future. Many of these cardinals had assisted\r\nbefore at the election of a Pope; it was a routine with which they were\r\nacquainted. But by no means could they know what a mark upon the world’s\r\nhistory they would make with this election. Subsequent events, however,\r\nhave shewn that the seed of tremendous issues here was sown, issues as\r\ngreat as the consolidation of a European kingdom under a sovereign\r\ndynasty that endured until 1870. As such, the Conclave of 1492 must be\r\nregarded as one of the most pregnant that ever have occurred; and its\r\ndetails, as worthy of intent consideration.\r\n\r\nThere was a faction and a shadow of a faction among the cardinals. The\r\ncandidate of the first was the Dean and Vicechancellor-Cardinal Rodrigo\r\nde Lançol y Borja, nephew of the Lord Calixtus P.P. III. He actively was\r\nsupported by the very influential cardinals Sforza-Visconti, Colonna,\r\nand Riarjo, whose friendship he is said to have cultivated during the\r\nreign of the late Pope, by promises of preferment and by gifts. He also\r\nis said to have won the alliance of fourteen other cardinals by similar\r\ninducements, and so to have placed himself at the head of a faction of\r\neighteen. His supporters were led to believe that his Spanish\r\nnationality would make him neutral to the political parties of Italy;\r\nand much stress was laid upon the fact that Spain was now the rising\r\npower in Europe, with whom the Church would do well to be allied. The\r\nstandard of morality of the day prevented objections to the character of\r\nCardinal Rodrigo; and it was made clear to all that he was by far the\r\nrichest cardinal, holding all the most lucrative appointments, which\r\nlast would have to be vacated, and would be his to give away, in the\r\nevent of his election.\r\n\r\nThe candidate of the second faction was Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere,\r\na nephew of the Lord Xystus P.P. IV. He was the life-long disappointed\r\nrival, in more senses than one, of Cardinal Rodrigo. His candidature was\r\nan attempt on the part of the Christian King Charles VIII of France to\r\nset up a Pontiff devoted to French, and not to Spanish, interests; to\r\nwhich end the King’s Majesty deposited two hundred thousand ducats with\r\na Roman bank for the purchase of cardinalitial votes.\r\n\r\nThere was an independent candidate, Cardinal Lorenzo Cibo, a nephew of\r\nthe Lord Innocent P.P. VIII, to whom Cardinal Pallavicini was bound by\r\nties of gratitude: but he had no other supporter, and became submerged\r\nin the majority.\r\n\r\nOf the two contestants, Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere had the poorer\r\nchance. His own cousins, Cardinals Girolamo and Domenico della Rovere,\r\nwould not support him. His personality was universally antipathetic; his\r\nopponent’s was universally sympathetic. The French money which he had\r\ntaken, was but as a drop in the ocean compared with the enormous wealth\r\nand desperate determination of the Spaniard. Also, there were no votes\r\nfor sale. Four cardinals—the Lords Oliviero Carafa, Giorgio Costa,\r\nFrancesco de’ Piccolhuomini, and Giambattista Zeno—announced that they\r\nwould vote independently and under no influence; while the remnant of\r\nthe Sacred College, consisting of seventeen cardinals, having been\r\nfiercely canvassed by Cardinal Ascanio Maria Sforza-Visconti,\r\nrepresentative of the reigning House of Milan and hereditary foe of\r\nFrance, were already in the pocket of the Vicechancellor-Cardinal-Dean.\r\n\r\nThe third night of the Conclave concluded the preliminary discussions;\r\nand at dawn, on the eleventh of August 1492, Cardinal Rodrigo was\r\nelected Pope, by the large majority of twenty-two out of twenty-three,\r\nconsisting of his own vote with those of the Cardinal-Bishops Giovanni\r\nMichele, Oliviero Carafa, Giorgio Costa, the Cardinal-Presbyters\r\nAntoniotto Pallavicini, Lorenzo Cibo, Mafeo Gheraldo, Girolamo Basso\r\ndella Rovere, Domenico della Rovere, Paolo Fregosio, Giovanni de’ Conti,\r\nGiangiacomo Sclafenati, Ardicino della Porta, the Cardinal-Archdeacon\r\nFrancesco de’ Piccolhuomini, the Cardinal-Deacons Rafaele Galeotti\r\nSansoni-Riarjo, Giovanni Colonna, Giambattista Orsini, Giovanni de’\r\nMedici, Giovanni Savelli, Friderico Sanseverini, Giambattista Zeno, and\r\nAscanio Maria Sforza-Visconti.\r\n\r\nRome was exciting herself about this election. Four mule loads of silver\r\nhad been taken from the palace of Cardinal Rodrigo to the house of\r\nCardinal Sforza-Visconti before the immuring of the Conclave, most\r\nconceivably to be guarded there more safely. Rome guessed that the\r\nSpaniard was so certain of his own election as to be preparing for the\r\npleasant custom, which the citizens used, of pillaging the palace of the\r\ncardinal who was elected Pope. Some of the silver perhaps may have\r\npassed into Sforza’s possession; but there is no direct evidence to\r\nprove the absurd statement of Monsignor Burchard that it was the price\r\nof his vote. In the first instance, the security of the silver, was most\r\nprobably the motive for its transference. After the election the Pope\r\nwould naturally wish to reward his most useful supporter; and no doubt\r\nleft the silver[22] with Cardinal Sforza-Visconti while bestowing on him\r\nother and more proportionate acknowledgments.\r\n\r\nIn the Conclave, if one can believe reports, there was no less\r\nexcitement. All the sombre dignity of Spain left Cardinal Rodrigo at the\r\nsupreme moment of his life. He showed himself as just a human man,\r\nsuccessful in the most daring, most immense, of all ambitions, when his\r\nquondam colleagues lowered their green or purple canopies to his, as he\r\njoyfully cried: “We are Pope and Vicar of Christ!”\r\n\r\nThe cardinals knelt at His feet, and Cardinal Sforza-Visconti said that\r\nundoubtedly the election was the work of God. Then the new Pope\r\nrecovered at least decorum of speech, replying that He was conscious of\r\nHis Own weakness, and relied entirely upon Divine Guidance; but His\r\norder to Monsignor Burchard, the Caerimonarius, to write His name on\r\nlittle slips of paper, and fling them from a window for the satisfaction\r\nof the citizens who swarmed impatiently outside the Vatican; and His\r\nhaste to retire behind the altar for the purpose of changing His\r\ncardinalitial scarlet for the papal habit of white taffetas with\r\ncincture, rochet of fair linen, embroidered crimson stola, house-cap,\r\nalmuce, and shoes of ermine and crimson velvet (of which vestments three\r\nsizes are prepared, to suit the stature of any Pope); this order and\r\nthis haste shew that the Pope’s Holiness was most deeply moved, as any\r\nhuman being well might be.\r\n\r\nOutside, Rome rejoiced. Inside, the cardinals asked what name the Pope\r\nwould choose, suggesting Calixtus as a compliment to His dead Uncle and\r\nCreator, Who had brought Him first to Rome. But, now, the Pontiff had\r\nregained His magnificent composure, and He answered mightily: “We desire\r\nthe name of the Invincible Alexander.” Cardinal Giovanni de’ Medici, a\r\nclever, serious boy of the age of seventeen years, whispered to Cardinal\r\nCibo: “Now we are in the jaws of a ravening wolf, and if we do not flee\r\nhe will devour us.” But the gigantic Cardinal Sanseverini lifted the\r\nLord Alexander P.P. VI in his strong arms and throned Him on the altar;\r\nand the Sacred College paid Him the first adoration, kissing the cross\r\nembroidered on His shoe and on the ends of the stola at His knee, and\r\nthe Ring of the Fisherman on His right forefinger, while\r\nCardinal-Archdeacon Franceso de’ Piccolhuomini and the second\r\nCardinal-Deacon made proclamation to the crowd at the re-opened door of\r\nthe Conclave:\r\n\r\n“I announce to you great joy. We have for a Pope the\r\nVicechancellor-Cardinal-Dean Rodrigo de Lançol y Borja, Who wills to be\r\ncalled Alexander the Sixth.”\r\n\r\n[23]And, incontinent, says Monsignor Hans Burchard the vulgar\r\ntittle-tattling Caerimonarius, (wilfully misquoting the Vulgate Psalm\r\ncxi. 9,) having assumed the papal power, _dispersit et dedit pauperibus\r\nbona sua_, He hath dispersed, He hath given to the poor, his goods.\r\n(_Authorised Version_, _Psalm_ cxii. 9.) To Cardinal Orsini He gave the\r\nVicechancellor’s palace of San Lorenzo _in Damaso_, the fortalices of\r\nSoria and Monticelli, the revenues of the cathedral of Cartagena in\r\nSpain, worth five thousand ducats (which He had been administering for\r\nDon Cesare (detto Borgia) in accordance with the Breves of the Lords\r\nXystus P.P. IV and Innocent P.P. VIII), and the legation of the Mark of\r\nAncona. To Cardinal Ascanio Maria Sforza-Visconti He gave His new palace\r\non Banchi Vecchi (_v._ p. 67), the town of Nepi, the revenues of the\r\ncathedral of Agria in Hungary, worth ten thousand ducats, and named him,\r\nat the age of thirty-seven years, Vicechancellor of the Holy Roman\r\nChurch. To Cardinal Colonna He gave the Abbacy of Subjaco with all its\r\nfortresses and rights of patronage, confirming the same to his house for\r\never. To Cardinal Riarjo He gave the huge palace in Trastevere (now\r\nCorsini) vacated by Cardinal Sforza-Visconti, benefices in Spain\r\nproducing four thousand ducats yearly revenue, and confirmed him in his\r\noffice of Cardinal-Chamberlain. To Cardinal Savelli He gave the\r\nlegations of Perugia and Civita Castellana, including twenty towns and a\r\nrevenue of three thousand ducats; and to other cardinals the remainder\r\nof the preferments which He now vacated.\r\n\r\nIf these gifts were given and taken as the price of votes, then an\r\nenormous act of Simony technically was committed, the buying and selling\r\nof ecclesiastical power. Afterwards, His enemies continually were\r\ncharging Him with Simony; but, at the time, no serious accusation was\r\nmade. Even the four cardinals, who had announced that they did not\r\nintend to be bribed, voted for the Lord Alexander P.P. VI. And here it\r\nmay be noticed, that though Simony, by the Bull of the Lord Julius P.P.\r\nII _De Simoniaca Electione_, is held to invalidate an ecclesiastical\r\nelection; yet the said Bull was not issued until after the death of the\r\nLord Alexander P.P. VI, and was not retrospective in effect, although\r\nthe vehement personal hatred of Julius for Alexander, hatred worthy\r\nrather of Carthaginian Hannibal than of the Vicar of the Prince of\r\nPeace, leaves no doubt whatever of the intention to defile the memory of\r\nthe preceding Pontiff with an insinuation which never has been made\r\nvalid. Under these circumstances, it perhaps may be permitted to those\r\nirrational persons who habitually usurp the functions of the Eternal\r\nJudge, and who already have condemned the Borgia Pontiff, to remember\r\nthat, if this election was invalidated and annulled by Simony, He never\r\nwas a Pope at all, and therefore cannot be blamed, attacked, condemned,\r\nin a papal capacity. Much satisfaction of a kind may be derived from\r\nthat reflection. At the same time, though the theory might be allowed\r\nfor private consumption, as a “pious opinion” distinguished from a\r\n“dogma,” it would be highly injudicious to court collision with another\r\nBull—the Bull _Execrabilis_ of the Lord Pius P.P. II—which provides all\r\nproclaimed aspersions of the Popes with pains and penalties. But when\r\nall has been considered, no evidence is forthcoming to prove that a\r\nsingle cardinal sold—_sold_—his vote to Cardinal Rodrigo buying. None\r\nbut a purchased or unpurchased cardinal can testify that he sold, or did\r\nnot sell; and none of these have testified. That the new Pope gave great\r\ngifts is not denied. Popes always do. They cannot help Themselves. The\r\nLord Alexander P.P. VI vacated so much preferment, that He had much to\r\ngive. To give that preferment was one of the duties of His office; and,\r\nnaturally, He gave it to His friends, and not to His single enemy and\r\nenvious rival, Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, who, in revenge, alleged\r\nSimony.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Lord Innocent P.P. VIII died on the twenty-fifth of July 1492. The\r\nLord Alexander P.P. VI began to reign on the eleventh of August. During\r\nthe seventeen days that intervened, while the city was under the rigid\r\nrule of the white-faced Cardinal-Chamberlain Riarjo, a matter of some\r\ntwo hundred and twenty assassinations took place: in such order had the\r\ndeceased Pope left His capital that more than nine murders were\r\ncommitted every day among a population of a mere five and eighty\r\nthousand. The Lord Alexander P.P. VI acted with decision to end this\r\nabominable state of lawlessness. An assassin was caught redhanded—there\r\nwas no difficulty about that—he and his brother were forced to look on\r\nwhile their house was rased to the ground (the worst disgrace possible\r\nto a Roman); and then they were ceremoniously hanged among the ruins. A\r\ncommission was established to decide all quarrels, which, formerly, had\r\nbeen settled by cold steel. Official inspectors of prisons were\r\nappointed; arrears of official salaries paid up to date; and a bench of\r\nfour judges established for dealing with capital crimes. So the first\r\nact of this pontificate was the restoration, at least provisionally, of\r\npublic order. The admiring Romans said that this vigorous administration\r\nof justice was due to the direct disposing of the Almighty.\r\n\r\nThe coronation, on the steps before the Basilica of St. Peter in the\r\nVatican, of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI by the Cardinal-Archdeacon on the\r\ntwenty-sixth of August was a scene of unlimited magnificence, attended\r\nby the Orators of the Powers who hailed the Pope with the most laudatory\r\ncongratulations. Canon Angelo Ambrogini (detto Poliziano), who spoke for\r\nSiena, said :—\r\n\r\n  “Præstans animi magnitudo quae mortales crederes omnes\r\n  antecellere—Magna quaedam de te, rara, ardua, singularia,\r\n  incredibilia, inaudita, pollicentur.[24]\r\n\r\nThe Orator of Lucca said:—\r\n\r\n  “Quid iste tuus divinus, et maiestate plenus, aspectus?\r\n\r\nThe Orator of Genoa said:—\r\n\r\n  “Adeo virtutum gloria et disciplinarum laude, et vitae sanctimonia\r\n  decoraris, et adeo singularum ac omnium rerum ornamento dotaris, quae\r\n  talem summam ac venerandam dignitatem praebeant ut valde ab omnibus\r\n  ambigendum sit, tu ne magis pontificatui, an illa tibi sacratissima et\r\n  gloriosissima Papatus dignitas offerenda fuerit.\r\n\r\nThe Venetian Senate rejoiced:—\r\n\r\n  “propter divinas virtutes ac dotes quibus Ipsum insignitum et ornatum\r\n  conspiciebamus, videbatur a Divina Providentia talem Pastorem gregi,\r\n  dominio et sacrosancto Romanae Ecclesiae Vicarium Suum fuisse delectum\r\n  et praeordinatum.\r\n\r\nManfredi, the Ferrarese Orator at Florence, wrote to his Duchess:—\r\n\r\n  “Dicesi che sara glorioso pontifice!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alexander P.P. VI._]\r\n\r\nThose words were re-echoed from Milan, from Naples, even from far\r\nGermany, “They say that this will be a glorious Pontiff!” All who were\r\npermitted to approach Him were enchanted by His magnificent presence and\r\nHis honeyed tongue; every one praised His talents, His notable mastery\r\nof affairs, His active benevolence and beneficence. He was admired\r\nbecause His habits were of the simplest kind, and His magnificence free\r\nfrom prodigal ostentation: though it must be added that the Ferrarese\r\nOrator said that people disliked dining with the Lord Alexander P.P. VI\r\nbecause His meals consisted of a single dish. But Rome and Italy\r\ngenerally were very proud of Him, because, at sixty-one years of age, He\r\ncombined the vigour of manhood’s prime with the wisdom of experience of\r\nlife. If peace could be maintained, while a strong hand guided politics,\r\nthe auspices were all propitious.\r\n\r\nOn the thirty-first of August, at the First Consistory, the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI named his nephew, Don Juan de Borja y Lançol (Giovanni\r\nBorgia, detto Seniore) Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Susanna.\r\nThis Most Worshipful Purpled One was the son of the Pope’s sister, Doña\r\nJuana. He had been Apostolic Prothonotary, Corrector of Pontifical\r\nBreves, and Archbishop of Monreale, under the Lord Xystus P.P. IV; and\r\npowerless Governor of Rome under the Lord Innocent P.P. VIII. He was a\r\ngreat man of business, dexterous and capable with plenary powers, and\r\ncompetent to deal with grave matters. The Lord Alexander P.P. VI, like\r\nHis August Uncle, lost no time in securing the services of blood\r\nrelation near to His Own person.\r\n\r\nThe chorus of flattery was not altogether free from discords. The\r\nsinister Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, every day becoming more and\r\nmore aggrieved by the success of his abhorred rival, called for a\r\nGeneral Council (according to the ridiculous custom of his age) to\r\nadjudge the Lord Alexander P.P. VI guilty of Simony. In Florence the\r\neccentric Fra Girolamo Savonarola, a friar of the Religion of St.\r\nDominic, was prophesying evil days. Lorenzo de’ Medici, “that monster of\r\ngenius,” was dead; and he, literally, had been the Keeper of the Peace.\r\nHis sons, Don Piero and Don Lorenzo Secondo, brothers to Cardinal\r\nGiovanni, were no fit successors to their renowned father. Fra Girolamo\r\nreally ruled in Florence; and his rule was baneful, because he let his\r\npersonality over-ride his principles. Starting, a few years before, to\r\nconvert the sinners of Florence, he had preached naked Christianity.\r\nWhen he had smitten many souls to penitence, his converts (in the manner\r\nof converts) leaned upon him. He allowed himself to become a director.\r\nFrom director it naturally was but a step to dictator: and there is the\r\nhuman error of Fra Girolamo Savonarola. That is the point from which he\r\nwent astray. As dictator, he brought not peace but a sword—privilege of\r\nnot a human man. He ordained what the world calls eccentricities; he\r\nbecame impatient of opinion, of resistance, of control; his penitents\r\nwere the Salvation Army of the fifteenth century, making singular\r\nexhibitions of frenetic benevolence. He had made himself, by perfectly\r\nlegal means, independent of his local Dominican superiors; the\r\nArchbishop of the province had no jurisdiction over him; he was subject\r\nonly to the General of Dominicans and to the Pope in Rome. He was\r\nabsolutely sincere; he was a fervent Catholic; of his bonafides there\r\ncan be no doubt whatever. He had no attraction of manner; his personal\r\naspect was vulgar, terrible, appalling. Yet there must have been some\r\ncharm in his teaching, for great and holy men left all to follow him;\r\nMesser Alessandro Filipepi (detto Botticelli) joined him. And now he\r\nclaimed to be the prophet of the Most High, prophesying of evils at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMilan menaced the peace of Italy. By the assassination of Duke Galeazzo\r\nMaria Sforza-Visconti in 1476, the duchy passed to his infant son Duke\r\nGiangaleazzo; whose widowed mother, the Duchess Bona of Savoja, ruled as\r\nRegent. Four brothers of her dead husband conspired against her; and in\r\n1479, the eldest, Don Ludovico Maria Sforza-Visconti (detto Il Moro),\r\ntook possession of her child and deprived her of the regency. Cardinal\r\nAscanio Maria, brother of Il Moro, exerted himself in Rome to obtain\r\nconfirmation of this heartless deed. Duchess Bona, distracted when she\r\nfound her young son torn from her arms, knowing his infant life to be\r\nthe only bar between his uncle Don Ludovico Maria and the throne of\r\nMilan, made frantic appeals for the intervention of France. But the\r\nChristian King Louis XI died before he could reply to that poor mother:\r\nand Don Ludovico Maria, as Regent, thrived, keeping the boy-duke at\r\nPavia in a palace that was, in fact, a prison, in conditions not cruel\r\nnor fatal but assuredly not ducal, nor suited to the enjoyment and\r\nmaintenance of life. In 1489 Duke Giangaleazzo reached the age of twenty\r\nyears; and then it was remembered that his mother; the Duchess Bona, had\r\naffianced him in his infancy to Madonna Isabella, daughter of the heir\r\nof Naples, Duke Don Alonso de Aragona of Calabria. There appeared to be\r\nno reason why Don Ludovico Maria should exacerbate the royal House of\r\nNaples by interference with the keeping of this contract; the boy was\r\neager, the girl was marriageable; and the wedding was celebrated with\r\nappropriate pomp. The usurping Regent insisted, however, that, as the\r\nyoung Duke was a minor, he should still remain in the condition of a\r\nward; and the newly-wedded children retired to try conjugal life at\r\nPavia. A year later, 1492, a son was born; and then Duke Giangaleazzo,\r\nby paternity emboldened into manlihood, became restive against his\r\nuncle’s yoke, protesting that he no longer would submit to the treatment\r\nof a boy. But Don Ludovico was well aware that long confinement shortens\r\nlife; and he had kept his nephew a prisoner for ten years. He was not\r\nprecisely of the stuff of which murderers are made; or a knife-blade\r\ndelicately pushed between the youngster’s neck and spine long ago would\r\nhave made the sceptre of Milan his. As Regent he had absolute power; and\r\nhe was well content to wait. So he took no notice of Duke Giangaleazzo’s\r\nremonstrances; and, to pass the time, he practised marriage in his\r\nproper person, wedding the lovely Madonna Beatrice d’Este of Ferrara in\r\n1491. (Don Francesco Sforza, son of Don Bosio Sforza and Madonna Cecilia\r\nAldobrandeschi, heiress of Santafiora, the kinsman of Don Ludovico\r\nMaria, who arranged this marriage, was the Orator of Milan at the\r\ncoronation of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI in 1492.) After the nuptials of\r\nthe usurping Regent, the young Duke Giangaleazzo resigned himself to\r\nbear his lot. But his wife was furious, and thought of the interests of\r\nher baby son. “In real truth,” cried Madonna Isabella to her feeble\r\nspouse, “thou art Duke of Milan, and I thy Duchess. But thou art content\r\nto abide in Pavia while that Black, Don Ludovico, ruleth in thy duchy,\r\nand seateth Madonna Beatrice near him in my place on thy throne. I will\r\nhave that girl to know that she is no duchess, and that I, I Isabella,\r\nam Duchess of Milan.” And the lady wrote to her father, Don Alonso de\r\nAragona Duke of Calabria, who was heir to the crown of the Regno,\r\ninciting him to resent the insult put upon her, his daughter, to end the\r\nusurpation of Don Ludovico Maria, and to restore Duke Giangaleazzo to\r\nhis duchy.\r\n\r\nDuke Don Alonso was not unwilling. War was imminent between Naples and\r\nMilan. Then the Pope died; the Lord Alexander P.P. VI succeeded Him;\r\nand, it being an age when the Pope frankly was admitted to be Ruler of\r\nthe World, Father of princes and of kings, etc., all Italy and\r\nChristendom waited to know the new Pope’s pleasure.\r\n\r\nThis was the first of a series of extremely delicate positions in which\r\nthe Lord Alexander P.P. VI found Himself involved. On the one hand, the\r\nPapacy was at peace with Naples. On the other, the Pope’s Holiness found\r\nHis brilliant young Vicechancellor-Cardinal Ascanio Maria\r\nSforza-Visconti to be exceedingly valuable; and he was own brother to\r\nthat Don Ludovico Maria (detto Il Moro) against whom Naples was invoked.\r\nMomentous consequences waited on His action.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the eleventh of December 1492, there arrived in Rome Don Federigo de\r\nAragona, Prince of Altamura, second son of King Don Ferrando I,\r\nostensibly to offer to the Pope’s Holiness the obedience of Naples, with\r\ncongratulations on His coronation. The royal envoy sumptuously was\r\nentertained by Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, whose chief occupations\r\nat this period appear to have been the feeling of the pulses of the\r\nPowers, and the search for a potentate willing to be used against the\r\nBorgia.\r\n\r\nManifestations of goodwill between Papacy and Regno pleased the Romans.\r\nThe frontier of Naples was but a day’s ride from Rome; and the Romans\r\nliked to feel that beyond that frontier flourished a friend, not lurked\r\na foe. In private audience, however, Don Federigo said that the\r\nassistance of the Pope’s Holiness was required in a family affair; and\r\nhe made it clear that the attitude of Regno to Papacy would be\r\ndetermined by the extent to which the Lord Alexander P.P. VI would go on\r\nbehalf of Naples.\r\n\r\nThis was the case in question. King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary had\r\nmarried Madonna Beatrice, a bastard of King Don Ferrando I. On the death\r\nof King Matthias Corvinus, his childless widow Queen Beatrice had\r\nintrigued to get the Hungarian crown settled upon King Wladislaw of\r\nBohemia, who, in return for her Majesty’s services, had promised to\r\nmarry her. Such a promise of marriage was equivalent to a betrothal, and\r\na betrothal was only less binding than an actual marriage in that it was\r\ncapable of being dissolved; whereas a marriage was, and is,\r\nindissoluble. King Wladislaw of Bohemia had been crowned King of Hungary\r\nthrough the exertions of Queen Beatrice. She, preferring the situation\r\nof Queen Regnant to that of Queen Dowager, had performed her part of the\r\ncontract; and now King Wladislaw had changed his mind, and was about to\r\nask the Pope for a dispensation from the obligation of fulfilling his\r\npromise of marriage. This was a grievous insult to the bastard of the\r\nKing of Naples, whose counterpetition to the Lord Alexander P.P. VI was\r\nthat no such dispensation should be granted to King Wladislaw, and that\r\nhe should be compelled to perform his part of the bargain. Nothing was\r\nsaid at this time regarding the affair of the Duchess Isabella of Milan,\r\nin which the Regno also was interested. The cases of queens take\r\nprecedence of those of duchesses.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Alexander P.P. VI, with the experience of seven and thirty\r\nyears of curial diplomacy behind Him, required time in which to reflect\r\nupon His answer; and would enter into no immediate engagement with the\r\nNeapolitan prince. Don Federigo, who imagined that the Regno had but to\r\nask and have, was much aggrieved; and his host, Cardinal Giuliano della\r\nRovere, inflamed him with sardonic sympathy, and eyed the Regno, for a\r\npurpose, from that day forward. An uncouth pugnacious schemer was this\r\nMost Illustrious Lord Cardinal. As a captain of condottieri he might\r\nhave captured a kingdom: but as an ecclesiastic he was at all times\r\nutterly disedifying. The Lord Alexander P.P. VI seems to have treated\r\nhim with admirable forbearance, with contemptuous indifference, than\r\nwhich no attitude is more calculated to sting and irritate an angry\r\nmediocrity. He had been allowed to proceed in his turn to the\r\ncardinal-bishopric of Ostia without let or hindrance: he had rank,\r\nriches, and power. But he was discontented, jealous, filled with envy,\r\nhatred, malice, and all uncharitableness.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is imperatively important to be able to distinguish between the\r\nOffice and the Man; and to avoid the excessively vulgar error of\r\nconfounding the general with the particular. The pontifical acts of\r\nRodrigo, Who is called Alexander P.P. VI, will compare favourably with\r\nthose of any Supreme Pontiff, from Simon, Who is called Peter P.P., to\r\nGioacchino Vincenzo Rafaele Luigi, Who is called Leo P.P. XIII. His\r\ncomportment as man, and Italian despot, is another matter. The just\r\nnecessity of the distinction insistently is laid upon the student of His\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nMan does not yearn to please a person who is playing ugly tricks upon\r\nhim. The Lord Alexander P.P. VI particularly did not yearn to please the\r\nKing of Naples. While the envoy of the Regno was displaying his royal\r\nfather’s petition at the feet of the Father of princes and of kings, the\r\nPope’s Holiness was digesting news of a trick which had been played upon\r\nHim by the intrigues of King Don Ferrando I.\r\n\r\nDon Franciotto Cibo, bastard of the Lord Innocent P.P. VIII, had been\r\nenriched by his Father with the lordships of Cervetri and Anguillara.\r\nThese were pontifical fiefs, held by feudal tenure from the Pope. Being\r\na silly avaricious weakling, rather frightened of the responsibility of\r\nbaronage, Don Franciotto Cibo sold the said lordships to Don Virginio\r\nOrsini for forty thousand ducats; and went to live at Florence under the\r\nprotection of his brother-in-law Don Piero de’ Medici. Now Don Virginio\r\nOrsini had borrowed those forty thousand ducats from the King of Naples,\r\nwho was his firm friend, and perfectly qualified to understand the loan\r\nto be a super-excellent investment. The lordships of Cervetri and\r\nAnguillara lay between the Regno and the territories of the Republic of\r\nFlorence; and their transference into the hands of Orsini, Naples’\r\nfriend, signified the opening of a road from Naples into Tuscany, along\r\nwhich a Neapolitan army easily might travel, should King Don Ferrando be\r\npleased to campaign in a northerly direction.\r\n\r\nIt was Don Ludovico Maria Sforza-Visconti (detto Il Moro), the usurping\r\nRegent of Milan, who first saw the serious portent of this move: but,\r\nthough he communicated his discovery to the Holiness of the Pope, he\r\nlaboured under a slight misapprehension; for usurpers are the most\r\ntouchy of mankind, and see an enemy in everything which they do not\r\nunderstand. The northern frontier of Tuscany impinged upon the southern\r\nfrontier of Milan. Now that the southern frontier of Tuscany was\r\nconnected, by Cervetri and Anguillara, with the Regno, Don Ludovico\r\nMaria suspected an alliance between Don Piero de’ Medici and King Don\r\nFerrando I, between Tuscany and Naples, an alliance which most possibly\r\nimplied designs detrimental to the duchy of Milan—after all the real\r\nDuchess Isabella was Naples’ bastard, thought Don Ludovico Maria, the\r\nusurper—; and he envoyed swift couriers to his brother the\r\nVicechancellor-Cardinal in Rome, with instructions to advise the Pope’s\r\nHoliness of the imbroglio.\r\n\r\nThat was the news of which the Lord Alexander P.P. VI chewed the cud at\r\nthe time when He gave audience to the Prince of Altamura. With His\r\nmagnificent talent for resolving diplomatic problems into their\r\nelements, from which He could discard those that He deemed useless while\r\nreserving those possessing salient features, the Pope’s Holiness\r\nconcluded that the politics of Milan, of Tuscany, of the Regno, and the\r\naffairs of their respective rulers, were of secondary importance and\r\naltogether negligeable; but that the secret unauthorised transfer of\r\npapal fiefs into the hands of dangerous malcontents of the very powerful\r\nHouse of Orsini, required prompt decisive assertion of the rights of the\r\nPontifical Suzerain.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1493, Cardinal Ascanio Maria Sforza-Visconti was\r\nfound to be urging the Supreme Pontiff to act against the illegal\r\ntransfer of Cervetri and Anguillara. Loyalty to his brother, the\r\nusurping Regent of Milan, and his duty as Vicechancellor bound to\r\nmaintain the paramountcy of the Holy Roman Church—these make clear his\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nA clashing of interests between Papacy and Regno was an opportunity\r\nwhich Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere greatly relished. He did not\r\nhesitate to take the part of Naples. If he had one enemy whom he hated\r\nas perfervidly as he hated the Pope, that enemy was Cardinal Ascanio\r\nMaria Sforza-Visconti whose exertions on behalf of his rival had\r\ndeprived him of the tiara or triregno; and, having sworn that either he\r\nor Sforza-Visconti should quit the Sacred College, he avidly seized the\r\npresent chance of belabouring the cardinal as well as the Pope. He had\r\nthe support of Orsini, naturally. Colonna, always more Ghibelline than\r\nGuelf, was not unwilling to espouse the cause of a man who went about\r\nsaying that the Pope’s Holiness was plotting to ruin his reputation—his\r\nreputation!—and to deprive him of his dignities: and hence arose a very\r\nsingular and unusual combination.\r\n\r\nThe Papacy generally has been allied with Colonna or with Orsini. Such\r\nwas the importance of these houses, that during many hundred years all\r\nEuropean treaties and concordats contained their names on one side or\r\nthe other. But here, for once in their mysterious and interminable feud,\r\nthese mighty barons of Rome, with all their collateral branches and\r\ntheir myriads of armed retainers, were found united in a common cause.\r\nThe phenomenon may be explained by the rise of other baronial houses,\r\nwho were becoming quite as numerous and quite as potent as Colonna or\r\nOrsini; and who were equally desirable as allies. The most prominent of\r\nthese, in 1493, were the Sforza and the Cesarini. The Sforza descended\r\nfrom Don Giovanni Muzio Attendolo (detto Sforza); and included the\r\nSovereign-Duchy of Milan, by the marriage of the great Francesco with\r\nthe heiress of Duke Giangaleazzo Visconti; the Sovereign-County of\r\nSantafiora, by the marriage of Francesco’s brother Bosio with the\r\nheiress of Aldobrandeschi; and the Tyrannies of Pesaro, Chotignuola,\r\nImola and Forli. The Sforza blazon the lion rampant with the holy flower\r\nof the quince for Santafiora, and the salvage boy couped at the thighs\r\nissuant from a serpent statant for Milan. The Cesarini were a Roman\r\nhouse of enormous wealth and distinction, claiming a Cesarian origin. It\r\nwas already allied with the Lord Alexander P.P. VI by the marriage in\r\n1482 of His bastard Madonna Girolama Borgia with Don Giovandrea\r\nCesarini. Its representative, Don Gabriele Cesarini, was the\r\nGonfaloniere of Rome, who fought the Prior of the Caporioni for\r\nprecedence at the coronation of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, Who, in\r\nperson, accorded the first place to Cesarini. Don Giangiorgio Cesarini,\r\nthe heir, was allied with Sforza by marriage with Madonna Maria Sforza\r\ndi Guido di Santafiora; and Don Giuliano Cesarini held office in the\r\nApostolic Chamber. It was a house which, during centuries, had been\r\ncontent with secondary rank, while accumulating immense reserves of\r\npower, now to be brought into action. These were the two patrician\r\nHouses which the Pope’s Holiness found ready to His hand when Colonna\r\nleagued with Orsini against His peace. In fact, Sforza and Cesarini were\r\nthe right and left hands of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, as Colonna or\r\nOrsini were of His predecessors and successors.\r\n\r\nCardinal Giuliano della Rovere, after relieving himself of some\r\ntreasonable speeches, considered Rome to be unsafe; and fled down Tiber\r\nto his bishopric of Ostia, where he fortified himself and advertised for\r\nmercenaries.\r\n\r\nThe word war, to the bloody men of valour of the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, signified a game like that of chess. The sole object of war was\r\nprofit. It was undertaken simply to deprive an enemy of his goods.\r\nPrisoners were captured, and held to ransom. Cities and fortresses were\r\nreduced by starvation, or by a display of overwhelming force. But\r\nbloodshed—and this is noteworthy—was avoided as far as possible; and the\r\ngame chiefly was played by strategic marches, counter-marches, and\r\nmanœuvres. It was a business, a profession, “not more hazardous than\r\nthat of a professional football-player.” The superfluous men of Europe,\r\nand the temperamental fighters, served as hired mercenaries under the\r\ncaptains and the princes who could pay their price and afford them a\r\nroystering life. Patriotism, the honour of the fatherland, were unknown.\r\nExcept in the case of England, there was no national army. When a\r\nposition had been won, a city captured, the conquerors satisfied\r\nthemselves with the ransoms and the richest spoils. If the citizens\r\nwished to avoid the inconvenience of a sack, they collected a sum\r\nsufficient to pay off the rank and file. Otherwise the mercenaries took\r\nthe women, and had licence to recoup themselves by pillage. Resistance\r\nmeant torture and death: but bloodshed was an accident, not an essential\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nThe action of Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere was an invitation to the\r\nLord Alexander P.P. VI to engage in war. He had thrown down the\r\ngauntlet. He had made the first move in the game; and his gambit was a\r\nvery fine one, for the fortress of Ostia dominated Tiber mouth, and\r\nenabled him to paralyse Rome by stopping sea-borne supplies.\r\n\r\nLike all important characters, the Pope’s Holiness was neurotic; not by\r\nany means a coward, but quick to scent danger, susceptible of momentary\r\nfright. Early in the spring of 1493 He was going to a picnic, at the\r\nvilla which the Lord Innocent P.P. VIII had built for pontifical\r\nrefreshment at La Magliana, outside the walls; and when a cannon saluted\r\nHis approach He was stricken with a sudden panic, and galloped back to\r\nthe Vatican amid the frank execrations of His escort disappointed of\r\ntheir dinner.\r\n\r\nHere was the situation. The Pope was comfortably embroiled with Cardinal\r\nGiuliano della Rovere and his allies of Naples, of Colonna, of Orsini.\r\nTo some extent His interests tied Him to Sforza and Milan. Tuscany was\r\nundecided between the Pope and Naples. The other Powers looked on.\r\n\r\nWhile Don Ludovico Maria Sforza-Visconti was suggesting an alliance\r\nbetween the Pope, the duchy of Milan, and the Republic of Venice, to\r\noverawe the Neapolitan Bond, King Don Ferrando was intriguing with a\r\nview to discover whether he could make a better bargain with the\r\nSovereign Pontiff than with Colonna + Orsini + della Rovere. This was\r\nnot treachery. It was merely the Neapolitan method, of which all Italy\r\nwas fully cognizant. The King’s Majesty sent envoys to Rome, to Milan,\r\nand to Tuscany, to try to settle the Cervetri-Anguillara affair by\r\npacific means.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Alexander P.P. VI was well aware that no confidence could be\r\nplaced in King Don Ferrando I: but by way of giving him a chance He\r\nproposed a marriage between His bastard, Don Gioffredo Borgia, now of\r\nthe age of twelve years, and Madonna Lucrezia, a grand-daughter of the\r\nMajesty of Naples. At the same time He gathered troops and fortified the\r\nVatican and the Mola of Hadrian, with the gallery-passage, called Lo\r\nAndare, which connects them, enabling Pope and cardinals to run, in time\r\nof danger, from the Apostolic Palace to the impregnable fortress tomb by\r\nTiber.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of Venice flung itself into the arms of Don Ludovico Maria\r\nSforza-Visconti; for the Doge and Senate were dreadfully afraid lest the\r\nimpassioned appeals of the Duchess Isabella on behalf of her husband,\r\nthe pathetic Duke Giangaleazzo, should receive the attention of Naples.\r\nIf the said Duke Giangaleazzo should come to owe his throne to King Don\r\nFerrando I, then Milan would be, to all intents and purposes, a fief of\r\nthe Regno; and to have Naples lording it in Northern Italy would by no\r\nmeans satisfy Venice, which, on this account, preferred alliance with\r\nthe usurping Regent, even at the cost of winking at his usurpation of\r\nthe Regency of Milan. Now Milan and Venice in alliance were a menace to\r\ntheir own neighbours; and, acting on the principle that made those two\r\nPowers one, the duchies of Mantua and Ferrara, and the Republic of\r\nSiena, hastened to fall into line with them. This concatenation, being\r\nsuperior to anything that Naples could exhibit, also caused the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI to arrive at a decision: and, on the twenty-fifth of\r\nApril 1493, accompanied by an armed cavalcade of Sforza and Cesarini for\r\nthe ocular instruction of Colonna and Orsini, the Holiness of the Pope\r\nproceeded through Rome to the Venetian church of San Marco, on Piazza\r\nVenezia, where He ceremonially published the Bull of League between the\r\nPapacy, the duchies of Milan, Mantua, and Ferrara, and the Republics of\r\nVenice and Siena; after which, the river-port of Rome at Ostia being in\r\nHis enemies’ hands, He began to fortify the land-port of Rome at Civita\r\nVecchia, by way of giving effect to His warlike proclamation.\r\n\r\nAt this call of check, Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere howled aloud for a\r\nGeneral Council to depose the Lord Alexander P.P. VI; and Don Alonso de\r\nAragona, Duke of Calabria, wanted immediately to unite with Don Piero\r\nde’ Medici and the Signoria of Florence, and, aided by the Colonna of\r\nPaliano and Marino and the Orsini of Gravina and Bracciano, to assault\r\nRome from the outer side, while Colonna + Orsini, who were in the city,\r\nengaged in similar diversions. But King Don Ferrando was too sly. He had\r\nyet another piece to play. He knew, and none knew better, that the\r\nterritories of the Holy See during a long course of centuries had been\r\ndistributed among pontifical relatives and favourites; that, at present,\r\nthe States of the Church were smaller than an ordinary duchy; and he had\r\nheard of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI as a singularly affectionate father,\r\ndevoted to His children’s interests. Wherefore the Majesty of Naples\r\nconceived, and with absolute correctness, that the Pope’s Holiness\r\nintended, by hook or by crook, by diplomacy, by marriages, or by war, to\r\nrecover the possessions of the Papacy, and to use them to promote the\r\nfortunes of His family. Secondly, King Don Ferrando I knew France to be\r\nMilan’s northern neighbour; and he saw the exceeding possibility of an\r\nalliance between the usurping Regent, Don Ludovico Maria\r\nSforza-Visconti, and the Christian King Charles VIII of France; a\r\ncombination which, with the Papacy, the duchies, and republics, already\r\njoined in league, would be absolutely and permanently overwhelming and\r\ndisintegrating to the very Regno itself. To turn the flank, as it were,\r\nto give France occupation in another direction, he resolved on courting\r\nan alliance with Spain.\r\n\r\nTo this end he indited an invective against the Lord Alexander P.P. VI,\r\nadopting all the gratuitous insults and lying babble foamed out by the\r\nmalignant Cardinal-Bishop Giuliano della Rovere. “He leads a life that\r\nis abhorred by all, without respect to the seat He holds.” [Compare the\r\nspeeches of the Orators and contemporary dispatches.] “He cares for\r\nnothing save to aggrandise His children by fair means or by foul.” [So\r\nfar He had done nothing at all, by foul means or by fair, for His\r\nchildren; except to deprive His reputed bastard Don Cesare (detto\r\nBorgia) of the revenues of the cathedral of Cartagena, in favour of that\r\nvery Cardinal Giambattista Orsini who now deserted Him.] “From the\r\nbeginning of His pontificate He has done nothing but disturb the peace.”\r\n[This is partly true. The Pope’s Holiness wonderfully had done more than\r\nany preceding Pontiff to restore good government and order and security\r\nto Rome. But He had behaved, in a certain instance, in a way that was\r\nextremely offensive to the Spanish ideal of peace. According to the\r\nnotions of King Don Ferrando I de Aragona, himself a Spaniard—according\r\nto Spanish notions, and the Majesty of Naples was a Spaniard writing to\r\nSpaniards—the Lord Alexander P.P. VI was indeed a disturber of the\r\npeace. But the facts are these. In 1492, the horrible Spanish\r\nInquisition—that frightful and diabolical atrocity constantly condemned\r\nby Rome—under the guidance of the Grand Inquisitor Torquemada, had\r\nprocured the expulsion of the Jews from Spain. The Spaniards have much\r\nof the Moor, a touch of the oriental, the element of the human devil, in\r\ntheir blood. Throughout Christendom the Jews were looked upon with\r\nhorror, by no means undeserved. Many long years before, England had cast\r\nthem out; and now they were forced from Spain. The sufferings, with\r\nwhich the fiendish Spaniard visited them, were so fearful as to excite\r\npity even in Papal Italy, whose loathing of Jews was a habit of mind, an\r\narticle of faith, not an inhuman vice. Messer Giovanni Pico della\r\nMirandola (detto Fenice degli Ingegni) said:—\r\n\r\n  “The sufferings of the Jews, in which the glory of Divine Justice\r\n  delights, were so extreme as to fill us Christians with commiseration.\r\n\r\nSenarega said:—\r\n\r\n  “The matter (_i.e._, the expulsion of the Jews) at first sight seemed\r\n  praiseworthy as regarding the honour done to our religion; yet it\r\n  involved some amount of cruelty, if we look upon them (the Jews) not\r\n  as beasts but as men, the handiwork of God.\r\n\r\nMany of this miserable race came to Rome, where, under the expressed\r\norder of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, they were protected, and allowed to\r\nshare in that security of life and limb which He, at the beginning of\r\nHis pontificate, had ordained. The Romans did not like these Marañas, as\r\nthe Moorish Jews were called, any more than they liked, or like,\r\nCatalans, or Franks, or Goths, or any other foreigners save the\r\nEnglish-speaking race; and, following hereditary instinct, there were\r\noccasional attempts at persecution, the rigorous stamping out of which,\r\nby the justice of the Pope, caused intermittent rioting and disaffection\r\nof the citizens who only could look upon the Jews as fair game. That was\r\nthe only disturbance of the peace with which King Don Ferrando could\r\ncharge the Holy Father; and it was an act of justice and humanity. But\r\nthe fifteenth century, in common with the nineteenth (the twentieth is\r\ntoo young yet to be judged), was very wont to give a bad name to the dog\r\nthat it had failed to hang.]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAny success that might have attended the rabid calumnies of the Majesty\r\nof Naples was prevented by an occurrence of the most startling species.\r\n\r\nA mariner of Genoa, called Messer Cristoforo Colombi, announced to the\r\nSpanish Court, in March 1493, the astounding news of his discovery of a\r\ncontinent. An explorer’s ardour, combined with religious zeal, had made\r\nhim seek to extend the boundaries of Christendom. He had set out in the\r\nhope of finding a few islands. He returned to Europe solemnly asserting\r\nthat he had found a world. Universal curiosity was awakened, and a fresh\r\nexpedition planned, with which the intrepid mariner set forth on a\r\nsecond voyage to prove, and to secure, his prize. Meanwhile, Don\r\nHernando and Doña Isabella, the Catholic King and Queen of Spain,\r\nthought it would be prudent to bind this new world to their domain by a\r\nbond that easily could not be broken. The Pope, as Ruler of the World\r\nand Earthly Vicar of Jesus Christ, was held to have authority over all\r\nheathen lands, and to His Holiness an envoy went from Spain commissioned\r\nto announce the discovery, and to pray Him graciously to confirm it to\r\nthe Catholic King and Queen.\r\n\r\n_Precipitevolissimevolmente_ (no other word describes the act) was\r\nissued a Bull, dated “At Rome by St. Peter’s, the year of our Lord’s\r\nIncarnation, 1493, the fourth day of the nones of May, and the first\r\nyear of Our pontificate,” giving to Don Hernando and to Doña Isabella,\r\nand to their heirs and successors, all islands and continents,\r\ndiscovered or yet to be discovered, in the western ocean, west and south\r\nof a line to be drawn from the North Pole to the South Pole, one hundred\r\nleagues west of the Açores and Cape Verde Islands. The language of this\r\nBull is exquisitely touching; strong, pregnant, earnest, and majestic,\r\nas the Authorised Version of the Epistles of St. Paul. The motive\r\nundoubtedly is the motive of an Apostle to convert a world to Christ.\r\nThe grant is made to the Majesty of Spain, with commands to send honest\r\nGod-fearing learned and expert men to teach the Christian Faith; and the\r\npenalty of excommunication _latae sententiae_ is imposed upon anyone,\r\neven royal or imperial, who shall interfere. This supremely beautiful\r\nPontifical Act, the Bull _Inter caetera_ of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI,\r\nis given verbatim in Raynaldus, sub anno 1493. So in return for the\r\nBorgia, which Spain gave to Italy, Italy and the Borgia gave Messer\r\nCristoforo Colombi and the New World to Spain.\r\n\r\nDon Hernando and Doña Isabella, the Catholic King and Queen, were\r\nSpaniards. And when that is said all is said; and all the hideous\r\nhistory of the New World under Spanish domination is explained. Those\r\nsovereigns bore no goodwill for the Lord Alexander P.P. VI although He\r\nwas a Spaniard. They, like every other sovereign of Europe, were quite\r\nprepared to harass and to flout an unobliging Pope up to the verge of\r\nexcommunications and interdicts; when they, of course, would cringe and\r\ncower like the villainous usurper John Plantagenet: but the quick\r\ngranting of their petition in this matter of the New World, the immense\r\ndistinction which the Bull _Inter caetera_ conferred on them and on\r\nSpain, turned them, from suitors prepared with impertinence, into the\r\nabjectly devoted adherents of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, at least for\r\nthe time; and absolutely prevented King Don Ferrando’s application for\r\nan anti-pontifical alliance from meeting with success. This, no doubt,\r\nis that on which the Pope’s Holiness counted. Very seldom in life does a\r\nman so clearly see his duty with the certainty of reward for its prompt\r\nperformance. And very rarely, in the pontificate of the Lord Alexander\r\nP.P. VI, did He deign, so immediately and so unreservedly, to grant a\r\nfavour. He must have perceived, with that marvellous instinct of His,\r\nwhich led Him inevitably to the very roots of matters, that for once the\r\npaths of duty and of pleasure coincided. Certainly He unhesitatingly\r\nwalked therein.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth of June the Lord Alexander P.P. VI married His bastard,\r\nMadonna Lucrezia Borgia, of the age of fifteen years, to the Tyrant of\r\nPesaro, Don Giovanni Sforza, of the age of twenty-six years, with all\r\nthe magnificence due to His secular rank as an Italian despot; and\r\nthereby set wagging the tongues of those who lamented the decay of\r\necclesiastical discipline, and who could not distinguish between the\r\ndual and contradictory offices which the Pope was expected to reconcile;\r\nas well as the pens of professional manufacturers of squibs and\r\nlampoons. The wedding-banquet took place at the Vatican, in the presence\r\nof the Pope, ten cardinals, and fifteen Roman patricians with their\r\nwives. The Holy Father presented to the ladies silver cups filled with\r\nsweetmeats, throwing them into their bosoms _ad honorem et laudem\r\nOmnipotentis Dei et Ecclesiae Romanae_, says the golden-mouthed,\r\nvenomous, untrustworthy historian, Messer Stefano Infessura. In the\r\nevening there was dancing, with comedies of the conventional coarse but\r\ncommon type. This event is one of the bases from which disgusting\r\ncharges have been levelled against the Lord Alexander P.P. VI. It\r\nsummarily may be stated that those charges consist entirely of the\r\nunprintable gossip of enemies or inferiors, and that not one of them\r\nsatisfactorily can be proved. That the Vicar of Christ should have\r\ncondescended so far is impossible; that a temporal sovereign should have\r\ncondescended so far is probable, and, perhaps, regrettable; but the\r\nstatus of the guests, the ten cardinals, and the fifteen Roman\r\npatricians with their wives, guarantees the utter respectability of the\r\nDespot’s little private party from a contemporary point of view.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn June, also, arrived in Rome Don Diego Lopez de Haro to offer to the\r\nHoliness of the Pope the homage and obedience of Spain. These having\r\nbeen accepted, the Orator proceeded to remonstrate with the Pope, in the\r\nname of the Catholic King and Queen, regarding the asylum extended to\r\nthe Marañas who were fled from the Spanish Inquisition to Rome.\r\nThousands of these unfortunates were encamped among the tombs on the\r\nAppian Way, and had brought the plague with them. Spain execrated the\r\nPapal tolerance, and wondered that the Holy Father, as the Head of\r\nChristianity, should protect those whom Spain had driven away as being\r\nenemies of the Christian Faith. Further, the Spanish Orator said that\r\nthe Christian King Charles VIII of France was threatening to invade\r\nItaly and to take advantage of the quarrels of the Italian Powers;\r\nwherefore he urged the necessity of peace, and an agreement among the\r\nsovereigns of whom the Pope was chief. By way of showing that\r\nconcessions would ensure the unanimity of Italy, he set forth a list of\r\necclesiastical grievances that needed remedies; grievances “which, since\r\nthe days of the Council of Constance, had been standing complaints\r\nagainst the Papacy, to be urged in all negotiations for other purposes.”\r\n(_Creighton_ iv. 199.)\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPublicly Don Ludovico Maria Sforza-Visconti harped upon the league\r\nbetween Venice, Milan, and the Papacy. Privately he entered into a\r\nsecret treaty with the Christian King Charles VIII through Belgioso,\r\nOrator of Milan. Being an usurper he trusted not even his allies:\r\npreferring to have two strings to his bow, he believed that he could\r\nconsolidate his position only by disturbing the peace of Italy.\r\n\r\nPublicly, from his fortress of Ostia, that psychic epileptic, Cardinal\r\nGiuliano della Rovere, continued to shout for a General Council to\r\ndepose his Rival. The abominable character of this cardinal well may be\r\nexposed by stating that he was endeavouring to rend the Church and\r\nChristendom with a Fortieth Schism, in order to satiate his personal\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nAnd, like Gallio, the Pope’s Holiness cared for none of these things—for\r\nSpain, for Milan, for the contemptible cardinal. He believed in Himself,\r\nand in His Own power to rule. At least, He officially had been saluted\r\nas Ruler of the World.\r\n\r\nThe intrigues and invectives of the King of Naples deservedly having\r\nfailed, his Majesty made the experiment of a hostile demonstration. His\r\nsecond son, Prince Don Federigo of Altamura appeared with eleven galleys\r\nat Ostia on Tiber mouth; and rapturously was hailed by that\r\ntraitor-cardinal-bishop, with the Colonna and Don Virginio Orsini.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Alexander P.P. VI was willing to negotiate. Borgian\r\nnegotiations invariably meant that Borgia would give its opponents\r\nsomething, but not the something that they wanted, and always in such a\r\nway that it could not be refused. The Naples + Colonna + Orsini +\r\nCardinal Giuliano della Rovere conspiracy had demanded Cervetri and\r\nAnguillara for Orsini (and Naples) and the disgrace of the\r\nVicechancellor-Cardinal Ascanio Maria Sforza-Visconti to satisfy the\r\nspleen of him of Ostia. On the twenty-fourth of July the cardinal, the\r\nNeapolitan prince, and Don Virginio Orsini came to Rome to hear the\r\npontifical terms, which were:—\r\n\r\n  (α) That the Pope’s Holiness would confirm Cervetri and Anguillara to\r\n        Don Virginio for life; at his death they would revert to the\r\n        Holy See: but he must pay into the pontifical treasury their\r\n        price of forty thousand ducats, which he previously had paid to\r\n        Don Franciotto Cibo:\r\n\r\n  (β) That the Pope’s Holiness was willing to forgive and to show favour\r\n        to Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere: but He refused to disgrace\r\n        the Vicechancellor-Cardinal Ascanio Maria Sforza-Visconti:\r\n\r\n  (γ) That the Pope’s Holiness would consent to ally Himself with the\r\n        Royal House of Naples by the marriage of His bastard, Don\r\n        Gioffredo Borgia, to Madonna Sancia, bastard of Don Alonso de\r\n        Aragona, Duke of Calabria and heir of King Don Ferrando I. This\r\n        agreement was ratified by betrothal; and Don Gioffredo set out\r\n        for Naples to see the girl, and to receive her dowry with the\r\n        title Prince of Squillace. The marriage was postponed for the\r\n        present, because neither bride nor bridegroom had completed\r\n        their thirteenth year.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the treaty of peace signed, than the Sieur Perron de\r\nBasche, Orator of the Christian King Charles VIII of France, arrived in\r\nRome, armed with instructions to prevent an alliance between Papacy and\r\nRegno, and to obtain pontifical confirmation of the election, by the\r\nRouen chapter, of Messire Georges d’Amboise as Archbishop. The Supreme\r\nPontiff, by way of emphasising His independent attitude to France,\r\nrefused to receive the Orator in audience, annulled the election of\r\nMessire Georges d’Amboise, and named one of His Own court to the\r\nArchbishopric of Rouen. This was what the twentieth century timidly\r\ncalls an “unfriendly act”; and the Christian King forthwith began to\r\nsympathise with Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere’s recent clamour for a\r\nGeneral Council to depose the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, and to meditate\r\nthereon day and night.[25]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo strengthen His influence in the Sacred College by adding creatures of\r\nHis Own, at the Second Consistory of the twentieth of September 1493,\r\nthe Lord Alexander P.P. VI named twelve new cardinals.\r\n\r\nThese were:—\r\n\r\n  (α) The Lord John Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord High\r\n        Chancellor of England, whose virtues have been praised\r\n        by another English Chancellor, the Blessed Sir Thomas\r\n        More;—Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Anastasia;\r\n\r\n  (β) The Lord Giovantonio di Sangiorgio;—Cardinal-Presbyter of the\r\n        Title of San Nereo e Sant’ Achilleo;\r\n\r\n  (γ) Frère Jean Villiers de la Grolaye, Lord Abbot of Saint Denys by\r\n        Paris;—Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Sabina;\r\n\r\n  (δ) The Lord Bernardino Lopez de Caravajal, Apostolic Legate to Caesar\r\n        Friedrich IV, the eloquent preacher at the Conclave of\r\n        1492;—Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San Marcellino e San\r\n        Pietro:\r\n\r\n  (ε) The Lord Raymond Perauld,[26] a Frenchman, Apostolic Nuncio in\r\n        Germany;—Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San Giovanni e San\r\n        Paolo:\r\n\r\n  (ζ) The Lord Cesare (detto Borgia), reputed bastard of the Lord\r\n        Alexander P.P. VI, and of the age of eighteen\r\n        years;—Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria _Nuova_:\r\n\r\n  (η) The Lord Ippolito d’Este, of the age of fifteen years, a great\r\n        athlete and fighter from boyhood to youth, and a prince of the\r\n        Royal House of Ferrara; “tall he was of frame, brawny of\r\n        sinew, mighty of limb, strengthening his robustitude with\r\n        exercises, archery, and hurling javelins; grace and charm\r\n        bloomed on the face of him; his bright eyes beamed with grave\r\n        tranquillity, worthy of all praise; most royal was his whole\r\n        aspect; he was an expert swimmer; and with whatsoever weapons\r\n        he adroitly strove he innured himself to heat and cold and\r\n        night-long vigils”;—Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Lucia _in Silice,\r\n        alias in Orfea_:\r\n\r\n  (θ) The Lord Fryderyk Kasimierz Jagelone di Polonia, son of King\r\n        Kasimierz of Poland, Bishop of Cracow;—Cardinal-Deacon of Santa\r\n        Lucia _in Septisolio, alias in Septizonio_:\r\n\r\n  (ι) The Lord Giuliano Cesarini (detto Giuniore), Apostolic\r\n        Prothonotary, Canon of the Vatican Basilica;—Cardinal-Deacon of\r\n        San Sergio e San Bacco:\r\n\r\n  (κ) The Lord Domenico Grimani, Apostolic Prothonotary;—Cardinal-Deacon\r\n        of San Niccolo _inter Imagines_:\r\n\r\n  (λ) The Lord Alessandro Farnese, Apostolic Prothonotary (nicknamed\r\n        “Cardinal Petticoat,” on account of the Pope’s partiality for\r\n        his sister, Madonna Giulia Orsini nata Farnese);—Cardinal-Deacon\r\n        of San Cosma e San Damiano:\r\n\r\n  (μ) The Lord Bernardino de’ Lunati, Apostolic Prothonotary, friend of\r\n        the Cardinal-Vicechancellor;—Cardinal-Deacon of San Ciriaco\r\n        _alle Terme Diocleziane_.[27]\r\n\r\nThe vigour of this deed struck Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere and his\r\nfriend King Don Ferrando into frantic silence. By a mere act of His\r\nSovereign Will the Holiness of the Pope immensely had increased His Own\r\npotentiality. Two of the new creatures were scions of reigning\r\ndynasties, whose loyalty thereby was secured. The virtue and eloquence\r\nof the English cardinal were as twin towers of strength. The two French\r\ncreatures were as a sop to France. The minor diaconate conferred on Don\r\nCesare (detto Borgia) gave him a standing, from which the splendour of\r\nhis youth might do great things. And the other cardinals were proved\r\nadherents, who, by being made to owe their promotion to the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI, became bound (in so far as human foresight went) to\r\nHis interests by the bond of gratitude. It was a most paralysing and\r\ndisheartening stroke for the enemies of the Sovereign Pontiff; and the\r\nyear 1493 ended amid renewed demands for a General Council from Cardinal\r\nGiuliano della Rovere, and renewed invectives from the Majesty of\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fifth of January 1494, King Don Ferrando I died, in the\r\nseventieth year of his age and the thirty-fifth of his reign. He was a\r\ncautious and experienced politician; and, since the Lord Pius P.P. II,\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici, and the great Duke Francesco Sforza-Visconti, the\r\ngreatest secular statesman of his century. His policy was directed to\r\nthe preservation of Italy from French invasion, and to the destruction\r\nof the Papal States. He was not harsh in his dealings with his\r\nsubjects: but to his barons and to his opponents he behaved with\r\ncruelty and treachery. He liked to have his enemies always near him,\r\neither alive in the dungeons of his palace, or dead, and embalmed, and\r\nclothed in their habits as they lived. Yet he died regretted; for his\r\nheir, the thick-haired, thin-lipped, narrow-eyed, fat-jowled,\r\nasymmetrically-featured Don Alonso de Aragona, Duke of Calabria,\r\nenjoyed a reputation for violence and brutality the bare idea of which\r\ncreated universal terror.\r\n\r\nThe game of politics entered on a new phase. The Christian King\r\nCharles VIII of France was burning for an opportunity of asserting\r\nhimself; and had collected an army, ostensibly for a Crusade against\r\nthe Great Turk, the Sultán Bajazet, really for purposes of French\r\naggrandisement—purposes yet undefined. He was a self-conceited little\r\nabortion, this Christian King, of the loosest morals even for a king,\r\nof gross semitic type, with a fiery birth-flare round his left eye,\r\nand twelve toes on his feet hidden in splayed shoes, which set the\r\nfashion in foot-gear for the end of the fifteenth century in Italy;\r\nand, like all vain little men, he was anxious to cut a romantic and\r\nconsiderable figure. He announced a claim to the crown of Naples.\r\n\r\nThis made it necessary for the Lord Alexander P.P. VI to compare the\r\nadvantages of France as an ally with the Regno; and, in the meantime,\r\nthat He might lead the Christian King to declare himself with more\r\nparticularity, the Pope’s Holiness addressed a Brief to him in which the\r\nsubject of Naples was not named: but which assured him of pontifical\r\nfavour, and gave him leave to pass through Rome with his army on the way\r\nto his contemplated Crusade. There was dissatisfaction in the Sacred\r\nCollege about the matter of the Archbishopric of Rouen; and some of the\r\ncardinals were beginning to think that the time was come for turning\r\ncoats, especially as it was known that the Orator of France had made\r\novertures of friendship on the part of his sovereign to Cardinal\r\nGiuliano della Rovere.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Pontiff finally concluded that He would rather have an ally\r\non His frontier, than an ally whose territories were separated from His\r\nby the domains of other princes. He decided to leave France out of the\r\nquestion; and to recognize the heir of the late King Don Ferrando I.\r\nAccordingly He conveyed this news to Don Alonso de Aragona Duke of\r\nCalabria, adding that He would envoy a Legate to Naples to concede\r\ninvestiture and to perform the ceremony of coronation. At the same time,\r\nthe Pope’s Holiness sent the Golden Rose to the Christian King; and it\r\nis hard to know whether this gift symbolized consolation or contempt. If\r\nthe former, then the gift should have been a sword; for the Sword is the\r\npontifical gift to kings. If the latter, then it was bitterly\r\nappropriate, for the Golden Rose is the pontifical gift to queens. Yet\r\nonly with difficulty one can conceive of the Pope as deliberately\r\nsetting himself to provoke a reigning sovereign who heads a mobilized\r\narmy; and the act may have been merely one of those slipshod\r\nperformances which the greatest geniuses, from time to time, provide to\r\nremind mankind of the maxim _non semper arcum tendit Apollo_. But all\r\nthe same the Lord Alexander P.P. VI was a very strong man, guilty of\r\nhiding none of His human weaknesses.\r\n\r\nWhen the Pope issued His Bull on this matter of the Investiture in\r\nPublic Consistory, storms ensued. Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, again\r\ndiplomatically deprived of his Neapolitan friends, flitted from Rome to\r\nOstia with the pontifical condottieri at his heels. From Ostia, he\r\nshipped to Genoa, and made haste to present himself to the pink-eyed\r\nMajesty of France. The French Orators in Rome shrieked “We are betrayed”\r\nin the consecrated formula; and hurried to safe places. And the fortress\r\nof Ostia capitulated to the Pope.\r\n\r\nIn May, the Lord Giovanni Borgia, Archbishop of Monreale and\r\nCardinal-Priest of the Title of Santa Susanna, received his Brief as\r\nApostolic Ablegate, and went to Naples to crown the new king. The\r\nfourteen-year-old Don Gioffredo Borgia accompanied his Most Worshipful\r\ncousin; and was married on the coronation-day, the seventh of May.\r\n\r\nMadonna Sancia, bastard of King Don Alonso II, who confirmed to him the\r\ntitle of Prince of Squillace with a revenue of forty thousand ducats.\r\nAlso, as an earnest of his gratitude to the Pope, the King of Naples\r\nconferred the Principalities of Teano and Tricarico on Don Juan\r\nFrancisco de Lançol y Borja, eldest surviving bastard of the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI (who already had procured for him the Spanish duchy of\r\nGandia;) and enriched Cardinal Cesare (detto Borgia) with Neapolitan\r\nbenefices. The Papacy and the Regno now were a Dual Alliance.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Italy of the fifteenth century, men’s minds chiefly were occupied\r\nwith the accumulation and disposition of matters connected with the\r\nintellect and the tastes. The Elect-Emperor Maximilian, who in 1493\r\nsucceeded the Pacific Caesar Friedrich IV on the throne of Central\r\nEurope (called the Holy Roman Empire) was adding outlying territories to\r\nthe possessions of his dynasty, the Habsburg House of Austria. Spain was\r\nfreeing herself, by means of steel and faggot, from her brain, _i.e._,\r\nthe Moors and Jews; and in exploiting her New World. England was\r\nenjoying peace and a new dynasty, since the close of the War of the\r\nRoses in 1485. France had made peace, at a price, with King Henry VII\r\nTudor in 1492; and with Spain, at the cost of her frontier provinces of\r\nCerdogne and Rouissillion, in 1493. Lastly, the Christian King Charles\r\nVIII of France had pacified the rage of the Elect-Emperor Maximilian,\r\nwhom he had robbed of his betrothed the Duchess Anne of Bretagne, by\r\nceding to him the greater part of Burgundy. For the rest, nearly all the\r\nkingdoms, duchies, and fiefs of France had fallen into the hands of the\r\nvaunting Charles, by conquest, inheritance, lapse or marriage. Finding\r\nhimself at the head of a great army experienced in the art of war, and\r\nwith a domain smiling with prosperity, he looked for fresh fields to\r\nconquer. The chivalric glamour of the Crusade had by no means faded: it\r\ndazzled the pink eye of France: and, at one time, undoubtedly the\r\nChristian King intended to march on the Muslim Infidel, now settled in\r\nEurope and unmolested. But, with the death of King Don Ferrando I, the\r\nfickle Frenchman revived an old claim of the House of Anjou to the crown\r\nof Naples, intrigued with Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, and brought\r\nhis veteran army south to Lyons; where he spent his time in lubricity,\r\nuntil he should have felt the pulses of the Italian Powers with\r\nreference to his undertaking. French envoys reported to him that the\r\nPapacy was allied with Naples, and Naples with Don Piero de’ Medici of\r\nTuscany; that Don Filiberto the Fair, (the boy-duke of Savoja, married\r\nto the Elect-Emperor’s daughter Anne,) with Duke Ercole d’Este of\r\nFerrara, the Marquesses of Monserrat and Saluzzo, and the Republic of\r\nVenice, were neutral. The auguries were not propitious for France; but\r\nthe Christian King, emboldened by the presence, and attentive to the\r\nrhodomontades of, Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, and stupidly believing\r\nit possible to reduce a Pope by fear, joined in the duet and cried for a\r\nGeneral Council. Indeed, he placed more confidence in the virtue of this\r\nthreat than in his army; for he definitely threatened the Lord Alexander\r\nP.P. VI with deposition and deprivation of the Apostolic dignity, not by\r\nforce of arms, but by canonical proof of His simoniacal election—unless\r\nHe would concede to France the crown of Naples. (Corio, Storie di\r\nMilano. III 525)\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to understand these shouters for a General Council.\r\nThey were so clever, so logical, in other matters, that it is perfectly\r\nimpossible for them to have been unaware of the extreme futility of\r\ntheir cry. They could not have been ignorant: then they must have been\r\nmalignant. Suppose that an assemblage calling itself a General Council\r\nhad been convened by the Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia and the Majesty of\r\nFrance, and had proved to its own satisfaction that Cardinal Rodrigo de\r\nLançol y Borja had bought, by bribery, the votes of his\r\nbrother-cardinals, raising himself by these means to the throne of God’s\r\nVicegerent; what end would have been served? There was a moral but no\r\nlegal prohibition then, as already has been shewn, to prevent a cardinal\r\nfrom buying votes, if he could find cardinals criminal enough to sell.\r\nThe money-changers were, as now, in possession of the Temple; and the\r\nwhip of small cords still on the Knees of God.\r\n\r\nSuppose that a self-called General Council had decreed the deposition of\r\nthe Pope on the ground of simony; the decrees of a General Council are\r\nineffective until they have been promulgated with the expressed sanction\r\nof the Roman Pontiff. Is it probable that the Lord Alexander P.P. VI,\r\nthat the sanctimonious Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, that any human\r\nman, would sanction the promulgation of the decree that ordained his own\r\ndeposition? If he did so declare himself to be no Pope, what would be\r\nthe value of such a declaration? If he were Pope, he would not; if he\r\nwere not Pope he could not, depose himself. Then what would have been\r\nthe good, (if the Sokratic method be so far permitted,) of a self-called\r\nGeneral Council which only could compile ineffectual decrees?\r\n\r\nWe are dealing with this matter in its human aspect only. Humanity was\r\nmaster of the mighty then, as now; Morality of the humble and meek.\r\nSuppose that a self-called General Council had decreed the deposition of\r\nthe Pope: what would have happened? This—the Sacred College would have\r\nsplit into two or more factions; let us say two, to keep the argument in\r\nreasonable bounds. The Lord Alexander P.P. VI would have headed one\r\nfaction; the envious Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere the other. Both\r\nwould have gone into Conclave; the one in Rome, the other in France. The\r\nRoman Conclave would have affirmed the Lord Alexander P.P. VI to be the\r\nPontiff-Regnant. The French conclave would have elected Cardinal\r\nGiuliano della Rovere, who incontinently would have blossomed forth as\r\nPseudopontiff Julius II. Each would have created cardinals. Each would\r\nhave administered as much of the Church and Christendom as he could have\r\npersuaded to submit to his administration. There would have been a\r\nPontiff in Rome, a pseudopontiff in France. The sheep of Christ’s Flock\r\nwould have been neglected, while the shepherds exchanged anathemas. It\r\nall had happened before—many times before. It would have been the\r\nFortieth Schism. In course of time, death would claim the Pontiff or the\r\npseudopontiff. His party would replace him. In course of time\r\nsubdivision would take place, a schism in a schism. A section of\r\ncardinals would secede from Pontiff, or from pseudopontiff; call\r\nthemselves the Sacred College in Conclave, and elect a second\r\npseudopontiff. Christendom would have been torn asunder. The crime would\r\nhave been capable of infinite development. All had been seen before,\r\nmany times before—last, in this identical Fifteenth Century—the century\r\nof the Thirty-ninth Schism of the Holy Roman Church, the Thirty-ninth\r\nRending of the Seamless Robe of Christ.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the atrocious turpitude to which Revenge was leading\r\nCardinal Giuliano della Rovere, and Vanity was leading the Christian\r\nKing Charles VIII, all light-heartedly.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBeing now in amity with Colonna and Orsini through the Neapolitan\r\nalliance, as well as with Sforza and Cesarini, the Holiness of the Pope\r\nproceeded to the Regno for the purpose of concerting a plan of campaign\r\nwith King Don Alonso II, whom He met at Vicovaro on the fourteenth of\r\nJuly. There it was arranged that the King should hold the Abruzzi\r\nprovinces with part of the Neapolitan army, while his son, Don\r\nFerrandino de Aragona, with another part should make a swift advance on\r\nMilan by way of the Romagna, sending out flying columns to sweep the\r\ncountry free from rebels; and, after expelling the usurping Regent, Don\r\nLudovico Maria Sforza-Visconti, and restoring Duke Giangaleazzo to the\r\nthrone of Milan, he should force the French to engage in Lombardy.\r\nMeanwhile, Don Virginio Orsini with the pontifical condottieri was to\r\nprotect the Papal States; and Don Federigo de Aragona, brother to King\r\nDon Alonso II, was to take the Neapolitan fleet, capture Genoa, and\r\ncommand the northern coast.\r\n\r\nNo better plan could have been invented for a war of the chess-game\r\nspecies: but in two places it was weak. It would occupy too long in\r\nperformance; for the French army was on Milan’s frontier which half the\r\nlength of Italy separated from Naples. It caused the defection of some\r\nSforza: it alienated the Supreme Pontiff from His vicechancellor, His\r\nclosest friend, for the Neapolitan scheme involved the expulsion from\r\nMilan of the brother of Cardinal Ascanio Maria Sforza-Visconti, who\r\nthereupon became neutral, Sforza holding by Sforza.\r\n\r\nBefore the Regno was ready, the French fleet reached Genoa, and the\r\nFrench army crossed the Alps to Milan. Admiral Don Federigo de Aragona,\r\nfinding Genoa in his enemy’s hand, led the Neapolitan galleys to Porto\r\nVenere on the Gulf of Spezzia, only to sustain a repulse which caused\r\nhim to retire to Livorno to repair his fleet. Seeing from which\r\ndirection he might expect attack, the Christian King garrisoned Genoa\r\nwith Swiss mercenaries under Duke Louis d’Orleans. On the eighth of\r\nSeptember, the Admiral of Naples took Rapallo, a little city six leagues\r\nfrom Genoa, and landed troops. The French commander made an accipitrine\r\nswoop from Genoa, cut up the squadrons of Naples, and put Rapallo to\r\nsack and pillage for entertaining them. All Italy was amazed, paralyzed\r\nwith horror, at war conducted on these bloodthirsty lines. The idea of\r\nbeing killed, except perhaps accidentally by being trampled underfoot in\r\na rout, or in a simple personal quarrel, was terrible to people\r\naccustomed to battles which were processions, and sieges which were\r\ndecorative occupations for gentlemen of leisure. Admiral Don Federigo\r\nled the remnant of his fleet to Naples without an hour’s delay.\r\n\r\nVicechancellor-Cardinal Ascanio Maria Sforza-Visconti now became\r\naggressive, and successfully detached from the Pope the Houses of\r\nColonna and Savelli; (the last, until their dynasty became extinct, held\r\nthe office of Hereditary Marshal of the Holy Roman Church.) Colonna and\r\nSavelli then collected their retainers and menaced the Eternal City. On\r\nthe eighteenth of September Don Fabrizio Colonna recaptured Ostia, and\r\nheld it in the name of its renegade Cardinal-Bishop. French galleys\r\ntransporting troops anchored in the mouth of Tiber. Crippled Naples\r\ndared not to advance on Milan leaving Rome unprotected. Then Madonna\r\nCaterina Sforza-Riario, countess and witch, (daughter of the great\r\nFrancesco, and widow of the infamous Count Girolamo Riario of the Pazzi\r\nConspiracy,) declared for France in her citadel of Imola, and made\r\nthings worse for Naples and the Papacy by showing them that an enemy was\r\nin their midst. In this strait, and having no sovereign friend in Europe\r\nsave the Majesty of Naples, the Lord Alexander P.P. VI applied to the\r\nGreat Turk, the Sultán Bajazet. That wily oriental agreed to help, on\r\ncondition that his brother and rival, the Sultán Djim, long years held\r\nhostage by the Papacy, should be delivered to his tender mercies. This\r\nthe Pope’s Holiness refused, not caring to connive at fratricide; and so\r\ncompleted the isolation of Himself and King Don Alonso II.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth of October, the Supreme Pontiff thundered from the Vatican\r\na demand for the restitution of Ostia, (held by Don Pierfrancesco\r\nColonna (?)) on pain of the Greater Excommunication. He “fills a great\r\nplace in history because he so blended his spiritual and temporal\r\nauthority as to apply the resources of the one to the purposes of the\r\nother.” (_North British Review._) At the same time, having intelligence\r\nof a Colonna plot to capture the Sultán Djim on behalf of France, He\r\nmoved His mysterious ward from the Vatican by way of Lo Andare to the\r\nMola of Hadrian on Tiber; and sent the Lord Francesco de’ Piccolhuomini,\r\nCardinal of Siena, as Apostolic Envoy to the Majesty of France. But the\r\nChristian King would not receive him, saying that he was coming to Rome\r\nto see the Pope Himself.[28]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Sultán Djim was a Mystery—the Fifteenth Century equivalent for the\r\nMan in the Iron Mask. The brother and rival of the Great Turk, the\r\nSultán Bajazet, who reigned at Constantinople, he was given as a hostage\r\nto the Knights of Rhodes at a time when Bajazet wished to win the good\r\ngraces of the Christian Powers, and to rid himself of a dangerous menace\r\nto his throne’s security. The Great Turk offered to pay forty thousand\r\nducats every year, so long as the Sultán Djim was kept away from\r\nByzantium; and he sent also the celebrated emerald, on which is carved\r\nan Image of our Divine Redeemer, to the Lord Innocent P.P. VIII. After a\r\nlong detention, Frère Pierre d’Aubusson, Grand Master of the Knights of\r\nRhodes and Cardinal-Deacon of Sant’ Adriano, transferred this valuable\r\nhostage to the Pope for greater security. The Sultán Djim was accorded\r\napartments in the Vatican Palace, and kept a court of his own there in\r\noriental luxury. The crumpled roseleaf of his existence was his constant\r\nfear lest his brother should envenom him; and envoys from the Great Turk\r\nwere only allowed to enter his presence when rigorous and ceremonial\r\nprecautions had been taken;—for example, an envoy bringing a letter from\r\nBajazet was compelled to lick it all over, outside and inside, under\r\nDjim’s own eyes, before the last would touch it. The Lord Innocent P.P.\r\nVIII, and His successor the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, regarded the Sultán\r\nDjim as a precious guarantee for the good conduct of the Great Turk. “As\r\nlong as Djim is in Our hands, Bajazet continually will be uneasy, and\r\nneither raise armies, nor molest the Christians;” wrote the Lord\r\nInnocent P.P. VIII. Later, the Great Turk conceived an alarm lest his\r\ndiscontented mamelukes should depose him in favour of his brother; and\r\nhe proposed to pay a hundred and twenty thousand ducats to the Pope for\r\nthe restoration of the Sultán Djim: undoubtedly intending to put him out\r\nof the way according to the methods observed by oriental potentates in\r\nreference to their rivals. But the Lord Innocent P.P. VIII refused to\r\nhave art or part in crime, though He would have been very glad of the\r\nmoney for His family; and the Sultan Djim continued to remain in Rome.\r\nThe same policy was pursued by the Lord Alexander P.P. VI,\r\nnotwithstanding that the Great Turk had ceased to send the yearly forty\r\nthousand ducats, thus making his brother the pensioner, as well as the\r\nward, of the Papacy. Then in October 1494, when the Eternal City was\r\nabout to be the scene of war and tumult, the Pope’s Holiness placed His\r\nward for safety in the Mola of Hadrian, the fortress tomb which also was\r\nHis own refuge.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Charles VIII of France_]\r\n\r\nOn the same day when Admiral Don Federigo de Aragona fled with the\r\nNeapolitan fleet from Rapallo to Naples, the Christian King followed his\r\narmy across the Alps. Being but a shallow-pated Frenchman, enervated\r\nwith the most horrible of all diseases, he already was in a quandary: he\r\nhad no money wherewith to pay his troops; his march for some weeks would\r\nlie through friendly territory, and, until he reached the pontifical\r\nstates, he could find no cities to sack for the appeasing and\r\nencouragement of his mercenaries. To meet him, hurried Don Ludovico\r\nMaria Sforza-Visconti, also in a quandary: he was an usurping regent,\r\nwith his legitimate sovereign under lock and key; and he was going to\r\nmeet a legitimate sovereign-regnant. Whether Don Ludovico Maria would\r\ncomplete a little loan, was the question agitating the mind of the\r\nChristian King. Whether the Majesty of France would want to champion his\r\nOrder, to release his brother sovereign and place him on his throne, and\r\nto behave severely and unpleasantly to an usurping regent, was the\r\ndifficulty of Don Ludovico Maria. The two met at Asti. The Christian\r\nKing at once broached his trouble; and Don Ludovico Maria, with his\r\ncapacious Sforza brain-pan and his determined Sforza jaw, instantly\r\nperceived that he could recommend himself by being useful. He advised\r\nFrance rapidly to advance southward through the Romagna where rich\r\nspoils awaited him. And he found the means. Of the man who will lend\r\nmoney at the very moment when it is urgently required, none but the very\r\nbest opinion can be formed. The Christian King was quite prepared to\r\naccept Don Ludovico Maria’s own estimation of himself, now. It was even\r\nsafe to let him see the pathetic sovereign of Milan in his prison.\r\n\r\nAfter being detained a few weeks by that which Italians call the French\r\ndisease, because it was introduced into Italy by this Christian King,\r\nCharles VIII dawdled on to Pavia; and visited Duke Giangaleazzo\r\nSforza-Visconti. The condition of that luckless prince was scandalous in\r\nthe extreme. He was of the age of five and twenty years. He had been a\r\nprisoner during fifteen years. He was decrepid of body, helpless and\r\ndull of mind. His only joy in life was in his Duchess Isabella and in\r\nhis four-year-old son, for whose protection he piteously entreated the\r\nChristian King. France put on a sympathetic aspect—it was perhaps the\r\nmost gracious moment in the little creature’s life—; the nostrils of his\r\nham-shaped nose wore an air of disgust at Duke Giangaleazzo’s suffering;\r\nthe glare of his boiled eyes in their congenital flush, and the severe\r\nfat line of his mouth, horrified the usurping Regent. Had the money of\r\nDon Ludovico Maria been in the coffers of any one just then except the\r\nChristian King’s, undoubtedly right would have been done by the might of\r\nFrance. But, with promises to return, with excellent intentions to\r\nattend to the affairs of Milan when Naples should have been reduced with\r\nMilan’s money, the Christian King was persuaded to hasten on to\r\nPiacenza.\r\n\r\nThere, on the twenty-first of October, news came to him that the prince\r\nwhom he had left in his prison, Duke Giangaleazzo Sforza-Visconti, was\r\ndead; and that Don Ludovico Maria had proclaimed himself, and had been\r\naccepted as, Duke of Milan. It was also said that the uncle had\r\nenvenomed the nephew, having observed him to have gained the sympathy of\r\nFrance, and fearing lest that sympathy should restore him to his throne.\r\nIt may have been so: but there is no evidence whatever on the subject\r\nbeyond the mere assertion. But it equally might have been the effect of\r\nconcentrated despair, at seeing deliverance come and pass away, acting\r\non a body, naturally weak, worn by passion and imprisonment, which\r\nkilled Duke Giangaleazzo Sforza-Visconti of Milan. The Fifteenth Century\r\n(and also the first decades of the Sixteenth) was so radically ignorant\r\nof the art and science, as well of venoms, as of their practical\r\nexhibition, that, unless direct in addition to circumstantial evidence\r\nbe forthcoming, mere unproved charges based on “on dit,” “aiunt,”\r\n“fertur,” or “dicant,” may be disregarded and a natural cause of death\r\nassigned.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFlorence, capital city of Tuscany and ancient friend of France, was in a\r\ncritical condition. Lorenzo de’ Medici was just dead. His son, Don Piero\r\nhad succeeded him. Don Piero’s brother Messer Giovanni, raised to the\r\npurple at the age of thirteen years, red-hatted at seventeen, was a\r\nCardinal of Rome. The genius of the great Lorenzo had made him disguise\r\nhis power. He had married at his own mother’s bidding Madonna Clarice\r\nOrsini, a patrician of Rome. His sons, educated by Canon Angelo\r\nAmbrogini (detto Poliziano), had grown up intellectual, grand, and gay,\r\nwith an overweening sense of their own consequence; and, when the\r\nsceptre fell into his young inexperienced hands, Don Piero forgot his\r\nfather’s advice, “Remember that thou art but a citizen of Florence, even\r\nas am I;” and he behaved autocratically, despotically, independently, to\r\nthe immense antipathy of the Lily-City.\r\n\r\nWhen the Majesty of France began his interference with Italian politics,\r\nDon Piero de’ Medici and Florence, being contracted to the Regno,\r\ndeclined the offer of a French alliance. The Christian King retorted by\r\nbanishing Florentine merchants from France. This gave occasion for the\r\nenemies, (which, in common with all great Houses, Medici had) to\r\nblaspheme, muttering of the evils of a tyranny, of the advantages of a\r\nrepublic: and Don Piero’s cousins, Don Giovanni and Don Lorenzino, fled\r\nto the Christian King at Piacenza; saying that not Florence, but Don\r\nPiero only, was the foe of France.\r\n\r\nFra Girolamo Savonarola, friar of the Religion of St. Dominic, became a\r\nprominent and responsible figure in this imbroglio. Ecclesiastically he\r\nwas a subject of the Dominican Congregation of Lombardy, who was led to\r\ndesire independence and a pied à terre in Florence. Don Piero de’\r\nMedici, seeing naught amiss, supported his application to Rome for the\r\nseparation of the Tuscan Dominicans from allegiance to the Lombard\r\nCongregation; for, it was urged, the erection of a separate Congregation\r\nfor Lombardy would add to the dignity of Florence, and would be a slight\r\nto Milan. The Lord Alexander P.P. VI, when the case was laid before Him\r\nin 1493, was inclined to favour Milan on account of the\r\nVicechancellor-Cardinal who was brother to the usurping Regent: but, on\r\nthe advice of Cardinal Oliviero Carafa, who officially had examined the\r\nmatter on its merits, and who reported in favour of Don Piero de’ Medici\r\nand the weird friar, the Pope’s Holiness issued the Bull of Separation\r\non the twenty-second of May that same year. Fra Girolamo Savonarola then\r\ntransferred himself to the new Tuscan Congregation, was elected Prior of\r\nSan Marco and Vicar-General; and so became the absolute ruler of the\r\nDominicans in Florence, and subject only to the General of the Religion\r\nof St. Dominic, and to the Pope, in Rome.\r\n\r\nHe was a truly pious man, of the hard ascetic type, and very masterful.\r\nHe used his independence rigorously to reform his Convent of San Marco,\r\nwith, for a wonder, the complete concurrence of his friars; and so he\r\nformed a centre of the exclusively religious life. He would make no\r\ncompromise whatever. He would have God entirely served; and countenanced\r\nno paltering with Mammon. He utterly spat upon and defied the World. He\r\nburned every pretty worldly thing. Lewd lovely Florence executed a quick\r\nchange, and followed him in sackcloth and ashes. The alluring melody of\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici’s Canti Carnaleschi was drowned in the chaunting of\r\nthe _Miserere mei Deus_ and the Seven Penitential Psalms with Litanies;\r\nwhile disciplines and scourges in the public streets fell like flails on\r\nyouth’s white flesh. Fra Girolamo preached penance in the Advent of\r\n1493. In the Lent of 1494, he preached from the book of Genesis. When he\r\narrived at Noe’s Ark, he dwelled upon it; his subject fascinated him;\r\neach plank, each nail, became a symbol: but the moral of his allegory\r\nwas, “Enter the Ark of Salvation that ye may escape the wrath to come.”\r\n\r\nFlorence was disturbed by expectation of the French invasion; which,\r\nsaid Fra Girolamo, (mixing his metaphors in the only way that the\r\nvulgar really understand) was the Scourge of God for the Purification\r\nof the Church. In September, he preached again. Visions came to him;\r\nand he preached of them in parables. His success, his ever-growing\r\npower, produced in him an effect like inebriation. Not yet having lost\r\nhis self-control, he was able to see his danger. He made an effort,\r\nand ceased to preach. His brain was in a ferment; sleeplessness gnawed\r\nthe remnant of his physical strength. Again he mounted the pulpit of\r\nSan Marco, and thundered like a prophet, like a seer, not his own\r\nwords now, but “Thus saith The Lord.” He claimed εἰσπνοή—Divine\r\nAfflatus—Inspiration. Humanly speaking, he had gone out of his\r\nmind—was mad.\r\n\r\nThe excitement of Florence became a frenzy. “Behold,” Fra Girolamo\r\nSavonarola tremendously declaimed, “Behold I bring a flood of waters on\r\nthe earth!” And the French army entered Italy.\r\n\r\nFlorence was half-dead with terror, terror of the French, terror of the\r\nWrath to Come. She had exasperated the Christian King, was disunited in\r\nherself, and she had no troops. Yet—she might resist. On her frontier\r\nwere the strong fortresses of Sarzanella and Pietrasanta. A few resolute\r\npatriots might hold the mountain-passes on the road through Lunigiana;\r\nand an initial check which ruined French prestige would restore\r\nself-confidence to Florence. This was the time of the trial of the stuff\r\nof Don Piero de’ Medici; who, being in three minds, failed to stand.\r\nFirst, he sent his brother-in-law, Don Paolo Orsini, to garrison\r\nSarzanella. Secondly, he quavered, because the Florentines appeared\r\nsulkily to him. Thirdly, he dallied with the notion of submission to the\r\nChristian King. From the fortress of Pietrasanta he whined for a\r\nsafe-conduct. Arrived in the French camp he collapsed: lying prostrate\r\nat the twelve-toed feet of the Majesty of France, he implored pardon for\r\nhis impertinence in thinking to defend his fatherland; and he offered\r\nreparation. He assented to the French demand for the withdrawal of the\r\nTuscan army from the Romagna; for the castles of Sarzana, Sarzanella,\r\nPietrasanta, Pisa, and Livorno, to be held as pledges until Naples\r\nshould capitulate; for a forced-loan of two hundred thousand ducats; the\r\npledges immediately to be delivered and a treaty signed at Florence. The\r\nFrench had never dreamed that the road should open to them as though by\r\nmiracle; and by simplest Induction they said that God was on their side.\r\n\r\nFlorence was dismayed. Don Piero de’ Medici stayed with the French: his\r\nbrothers were in the vast Medici Palace (now Palazzo Riccardi) at the\r\ncorner of Via Larga, which Michellozzo built for mighty Cosmo. “It is\r\ntime to make an end of this government by children and to recover our\r\nliberty,” said the grave and sterling Don Piero Capponi; and the\r\nSignoria sent out an embassage to undo the mischief. There were five\r\nambassadors, including Fra Girolamo Savonarola whom Florence loved, and\r\nDon Piero Capponi whom she admired. They left the city on the sixth of\r\nNovember with plenary powers to modify the disgraceful conditions of\r\nsurrender. On the seventh, they found the Christian King at Lucca; and\r\nfollowed him to Pisa. He received them very coldly, saying that he would\r\narrange no terms except in Florence. To diseased France the degenerate\r\nFra Girolamo forthwith prophesied, “Know thyself for an instrument in\r\nthe hands of the Lord, Who hath sent thee to heal the woes of Italy and\r\nto reform the prostrate Church. But if thou dost not shew thyself just\r\nand pitiful, if thou respectest not Florence and her people, if thou\r\nforgettest the work for which the Lord hath sent thee, then He will\r\nchoose another in Thy place, and in His Wrath engulph thee. I speak in\r\nthe name of the Lord.” (_Savonarola’s Compendium Revelationum._)\r\n\r\nOn the eighth of November, Don Piero de’ Medici reappeared in Florence.\r\nThe City of Lilies knew that Don Paolo Orsini held the Porta di San\r\nGallo for him, with troops disposed about the district; and suspected\r\nthat he would summon her citizens and force himself upon them as\r\nDictator. On the ninth, suspicion redoubled, because he went with an\r\nimposing retinue to the Palace of the Signoria where the magistrates\r\nwere in conclave. The door was shut: a voice bade him enter by the\r\npostern, but alone. Don Piero de’ Medici turned away. A partisan of\r\nMedici in the Signoria followed him, and brought him back. In attempting\r\nthe little gate, there was some scuffle, some dispute; and the gate was\r\nslammed upon him in a gathering crowd which cried “Away—away—and leave\r\nthe Signoria in peace.” In a storm of hissing where stones were flying\r\nDon Piero de’ Medici flashed out his sword,—and—irresolutely—let it\r\nfall. His escort closed him in, and hurried him to old Cosmo’s palace,\r\nwhere all of the few Medici were arming. Cardinal Giovanni de’ Medici,\r\nnot nineteen years of age, risked his sacred person—risked, because a\r\nFlorentine mob had flung an archbishop in pontificals (Archbishop\r\nSalviati of Pisa) at a rope’s end from a window; and bleached with\r\nmortal terror the visage of a boy-cardinal (the Lord Rafaele Galeotto\r\nSanzoni-Riario Cardinal-Deacon of San Giorgio _in Velum Aureum_, aet\r\n16,) not sixteen years before,—his sacred person, because he who\r\n_suadente diabolo_ lifts hand against the person of one tonsured _ipso\r\nfacto_ incurs the Greater Excommunication,—he risked his sacred person\r\namong a Florentine mob, endeavouring to rouse them as of old to follow\r\nMedici with the war-cry “Palle—Palle—Palle.”[29] All was in vain.\r\n\r\nThe well-worn cry had lost magnetic virtue; and none in Florence now\r\ndared to own himself a friend of Medici. Don Piero rushed to the Porta\r\ndi San Gallo, where Medici had never cried in vain. None answered him.\r\nHis courage left him there. He infected with fear Don Paolo Orsini and\r\nhis bands; and all fled to Bologna. At night Cardinal Giovanni and his\r\nsixteen-year-old cousin, Messer Giuliano Knight of St John of Jerusalem\r\nof Malta, escaped in the frocks of Friars Minor; and from Bologna these\r\nthree Medici journeyed on to Venice where Italian exiles always found a\r\nhome: while Florence sacked the Medici Palace, plundered the priceless\r\nMedici Library of Manuscripts, and set a price upon the head of\r\nLorenzo’s son Don Piero.\r\n\r\nThis revolt was the work of Fra Girolamo Savonarola. For sixty years\r\nFlorence had enjoyed prosperity under Medici. She was the centre of\r\nlearning, the mediating power of Italy with influence in every state; in\r\nfact, as the Lord Boniface P.P. VIII said on receiving the Orators of\r\nthe Powers in Rome at the Jubilee of 1300, “_i fiorentini sono il quinto\r\nelemento_.” But the Dominican Friar had roused in Her those moral\r\naspirations which Medici had lulled to atrophy; and the contemptible\r\nblunders of Don Piero had proved a final exasperation. The newly-formed\r\nrepublic set up Donatello’s statue of Judith with the Head of Holofernes\r\non a pedestal before Palazzo Vecchio, with this inscription for the\r\nbenefit of budding despots, EXEMPLUM SALUTIS PUBLICAE CIVES POSUERE\r\nMCCCCXCV. And on the day of the expulsion of the Medici, little Pisa\r\nrevolted also, and threw off the yoke of Florence.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fortune of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI appeared to be in serious\r\ndanger. The French unhindered were advancing, and sedition was sown in\r\nRome. One more overture the Supreme Pontiff made, sending Cardinal\r\nRaymond Perrauld, a creature of His Own, to treat with the Christian\r\nKing, who with no difficulty persuaded the French Cardinal to turn\r\ntraitor to the Pope. A Brief, appealing to the Elect-Emperor Maximilian\r\nfor help proved ineffectual. The forces of Colonna beleaguered the\r\nEternal city. Within the walls, three disaffected cardinals, the Lords\r\nAscanio Maria Sforza-Visconti, Friderico Sanseverini, and Bernardino de’\r\nLunati, were interned with the Pope in the Mola for the sake of safety.\r\nWhen the pontifical citadel of Civita Vecchia fell, the loyalists became\r\nyet more disheartened. Orsini turned its coats and joined the French.\r\nCesarini alone of all the patricians of Rome continued to be staunch and\r\ntrue. Resistance was useless, things being as they were; and the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI gave leave to the Christian King to enter Rome. He\r\ncame. He humanly was master of the City and of the situation, face to\r\nface with the Holiness of the Pope, practically having His person in his\r\npower. The Majesty of France demanded the calling of a General Council;\r\nand God’s Vicegerent opposed him with a blunt and unconditional _Non\r\nPossumus_. Whenever the World has driven the Church against the wall,\r\nShe has become inexorably invincible.\r\n\r\nThe year 1495 opened with Rome in panic and disorder, in the clutch of a\r\nforeign army bringing desolation and a new disease. The Christian King,\r\nwho had come to accomplish the conquest of the Regno by means of the\r\ndeposition of the Pope, found the way completely blocked. He had\r\nstrutted on his twelve-toed feet to Rome, prepared to crow so very\r\ngallically. The decree of deposition actually was prepared, and only\r\nrequired confirmation by a competent authority. Inflated with gigantic\r\nmegalomaniacal illusions, he had believed that an evil conscience would\r\nhave made the Lord Alexander P.P. VI obedient to him. He thought by the\r\nthreat of a General Council (which he intended to convoke at Ferrara,)\r\nto blackmail the Pope into conceding the investiture of Naples. He\r\nineffectually had battered the defences of the Pope with cannon. And now\r\nhis Frenchmen would fight no longer, as some say; but others, like\r\nBriçonnet and de Commines, assert that it was the king who blenched. At\r\nlast, with his shallow mind congested with half-thought thoughts and\r\nuncompleted facts like these, he became aware that a General Council was\r\nnot a General council unless it had the Pope’s authority, which last he\r\nwas not likely to obtain; and that, without some means of bending the\r\npontifical will, he could not hope to win the crown of Naples.\r\nEvidently, he could not depose the Pope. He might, however, conquer\r\nNaples by force of arms; and, perhaps, the question of investiture by\r\nthe Ruler of the World, the Father of princes and of kings, the Earthly\r\nVicar of Jesus Christ our Saviour, which he realized to be imperative,\r\nwould wear a different aspect when he should ask for it as a conqueror\r\nwith the Regno in his hand.\r\n\r\nWhile the Christian King was stumbling to these conclusions, the\r\ninvincible Lord Alexander P.P. VI remained with His little court in the\r\nMola of Hadrian where He had His hostages secure, viz., the Sultán Djim,\r\nearnestly desired by France as a weapon against the Great Turk, and the\r\nrenegade cardinals, friends of Colonna and the French. Here, He was\r\npractically impregnable. The Papal States might go to wrack and ruin:\r\nRome Herself might be crushed by an alien heel, but from the Mola of\r\nHadrian a Pope, surrounded by His faithful few, could, and often did,\r\ndefy blockade as long as provisions held out; could, and often did,\r\nlaunch the lightnings of the Church, censures, excommunications,\r\ninterdicts; and force acknowledgment, and reluctant obedience, from\r\nrebellious sovereigns who, after all, believed and admitted Him to be\r\nRuler of the World, Father of princes and of kings, Earthly Vicar of\r\nJesus Christ our Saviour, titles, in defence of which (so very glorious\r\nare they) Pontiffs of these clear ages did not hesitate to court the\r\ndeath, admitting of no compromise of no rebate. Our potency, said they,\r\nif worth having, is worth fighting for, is worth dying for. And, as\r\ninvariably is the case, when a man shews that he wishes nothing better\r\nthan to lose his life for a cause, he saves both cause, and life.\r\n\r\nFrom the Mola of Hadrian then, the Lord Alexander P.P. VI deigned to\r\nmake these terms with the Christian King:—The French army was to be\r\nwithdrawn from Rome. The Pope’s Holiness would not interfere; and would\r\nlend to France as hostages for six months, the Sultán Djim with whom to\r\nmenace the Great Turk Bajazet, and Cardinal Cesare (detto Borgia). The\r\nquestion of the investiture of Naples was not even named. Having secured\r\nHimself by this agreement, in which He had conceded neither of the two\r\nFrench claims, the Supreme Pontiff received in formal audience the\r\nChristian King, who shortly after marched his troops southward along the\r\nAppian Way by Albano, Ariccia, and Genzano, toward the Neapolitan\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the Third Consistory of the sixteenth of January 1495, the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI named one cardinal, who was the Lord Guillaume\r\nBriçonnet, Overseer of the Treasury to the Christian King Charles VIII,\r\neditor of a book of prayers dedicated to the said king (Encheiridion\r\nprecum); Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Pudentiana.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Velletri there lived a certain Don Pietro Gregario Borgia, son of\r\nthat Don Niccolo Borgia of the Junior Branch, Regent of Velletri and\r\nFamiliar of King Don Alonso V, by his marriage with the Noble Giovanna\r\nLamberti. In 1495 this Don Pietrogorio was about the age of twenty-one\r\nyears (the age in fact of Cardinal Cesare;) and, when the French king\r\nhalted for the night at Velletri, he found means to exchange habits with\r\nthe said Cardinal Cesare (detto Borgia) and to help him to disappear,\r\nremaining as hostage in his place. It was a daring act, and soon\r\ndiscovered: but the cardinal was safe in Rome concerting new schemes\r\nwith the Pope. The Majesty of France grave instant orders for the\r\nhanging of Don Pietrogorio and for the firing of the city; and hurried\r\non to Naples. But the king’s first secretary, who had been commissioned\r\nto execute his master’s vengeance, out of sheer admiration for the\r\ncourage of Velletri’s Regent’s son, gave him a swift horse and leave to\r\nreclaim his own clothes from Cardinal Cesare (detto Borgia) in Rome; nor\r\ndid he give Velletri to the flames.\r\n\r\nImmediately on hearing of the French approach, King Don Alonso II\r\nabdicated in favour of his son Don Ferrandino de Aragona. Envoys from\r\nthe Catholick King Don Hernando of Spain embarrassed the Christian King\r\nCharles VIII of France with remonstrances on his invasion of the\r\nterritories of the House of Aragon: but the latter was not to be\r\nrebuffed. The fortress of Monte San Giovanni capitulated to him. His\r\nmarch through the Regno was a series of victories; and, in the capital,\r\nhe announced his intention altogether to relinquish the Crusade, and to\r\nadd Naples as a fief to France.\r\n\r\nBut three causes prevented this from becoming more than a French\r\nboast:—the action of the Pope, the action of the Powers, the action of\r\nProvidence. Directly after the French had quitted Rome, the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI retired to the pontifical castle of Viterbo, a mighty\r\nfortress in a cool air, and pleasant as a summer residence; where He was\r\njoined by Cardinal Cesare (detto Borgia) with Don Pietro Gregorio Borgia\r\n(now the last Most Worshipful Lord’s lieutenant and standard-bearer);\r\nand whence He commenced vigorous diplomatic negotiations directed\r\nagainst the French.\r\n\r\nThe Powers of Italy had taken alarm. It had never been contemplated that\r\nFrance would meet submission all along the line, and actually become\r\narbiter of the whole country. Milan, Florence the Papal States, and now\r\nthe Regno, had fallen: with the French in France in the north, and the\r\nFrench in Naples in the south, these intermediate duchies, states and\r\nrepublics found themselves in the position of an uncracked nut in a\r\nmonkey’s jaw: wherefore Italy gave way to fear. Also, Spain was the\r\nenemy of France, so was the Holy Roman Empire; and the Elect-Emperor\r\nMaximilian and the Catholic King realized the arrival of a unique\r\nopportunity for invading France by south and east, seeing that the\r\nFrench army was in Naples, cut off from its base by the Italian states.\r\nAll these circumstances and considerations, skilfully perceived and\r\nengineered by the Pope’s Holiness from His eyrie at Viterbo, quite\r\nnaturally resulted in the conclusion of a Holy League, consisting of the\r\nPapacy, the Empire, Spain, and the Italian Powers, against France.\r\n\r\nHis position having become untenable, the Christian King resolved upon\r\nretreat. Half his army he left in Naples; and marched northward with the\r\nrest. His coming had been a triumphal procession. His going was a flight\r\nthrough hostile territory. A second time he entered Rome with the hope\r\nof retrieving his lost prestige: but the Pope again retired, this time\r\nto Orvieto, and refused to meet him. Enraged by the slight, the polite\r\nchivalry of France to pain the Pope avenged itself on women, pillaging\r\nthe house of Madonna Giovanna de’ Catanei, and making Madonna Giulia\r\nOrsini (nata Farnese) a prisoner. Onward, northward, went the Christian\r\nKing, conferring with the mattoid Fra Girolamo Savonarola at Poggibonzi;\r\nfighting a desperate battle at Fornuovo, where he lost his army stores;\r\nreaching France with his forces disgraced and in disorder; and he\r\nhimself disabled by the sentence of the Greater Excommunication which\r\nthe thoroughly angry and triumphant Pontiff fulminated after him.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Florence, Fra Girolamo ceased not to labour on behalf of the\r\nChristian King, sowing seeds of political discord, and preparing the\r\ngerms of certain calumnies which, in later years were used by Florentine\r\nfriends of France. His sermons were French manifestoes, and\r\ndenunciations of Medici. He had stepped from the pulpit of the pastor to\r\nthe platform of the politician. His power was admirable and admired, his\r\nsincerity unquestionable; and earnest efforts were made to reclaim him\r\nfrom the doubtful practices in which he was embarked. The Lord Alexander\r\nP.P. VI summoned him by a kindly and paternal Brief to Rome; saying that\r\nHe wished to hear him personally, and to confer with him as to the\r\nmethods which he advocated. How revoltingly inconsistent are the writers\r\nwho rail against the Pope for His treatment of this degenerate friar!\r\nLeaving out of the question matters of dogma, articles of Faith, in\r\nreference to which the Founder of Christianity definitely promised to\r\npermit no error, it must be admitted that, regarding ordinary affairs of\r\ngovernment and discipline, a Pope-well-advised is superior to a\r\nPope-ill-advised. Well, here is the Pope having heard many hard things\r\nof Savonarola, definitely and gently offering to hear that madman’s own\r\ndefence, definitely trying every means, every most intimate and\r\nstringent means, to render Himself well-advised before proceeding to\r\njudgment. If the subsequent actions of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI\r\ndeserve to be called ill advised, it is not He Who should be blamed, but\r\nFra Girolamo Savonarola, who with inconsequent evasion, excused himself\r\nand continued his traitorous machinations against the peace of his\r\ncountry, in defiance of the law, and in contempt of the powers that be.\r\nOrder issued from Rome, inhibiting him from public preaching, and\r\nplacing his Convent of San Marco again under the rule of the Lombard\r\nCongregation. Then, Fra Girolamo professed ready obedience to the Pope;\r\nbut begged for the independence of his convent, a prayer which he\r\nsupported with such arguments as to obtain a favouring response, though\r\nthe inhibition was repeated. Before the formal Brief arrived Don Piero\r\nde Medici attempted to return to Florence from Venetian exile; being\r\nfoiled solely by a violent diatribe in which Fra Girolamo denounced him.\r\nAs time passed, the friar intrigued with Ferrara, gained over and\r\ncultivated many influential Florentines; and then the Signoria took up\r\nhis cause and formally appealed to Rome for the removal of his\r\ninhibition.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe passage of the French through the Papal States, like a blight of\r\ncaterpillars, brought famine into the country districts. In the\r\nFifteenth Century, armies were not encumbered by a commissariat. They\r\nrobbed right and left, living on the produce of the land in which they\r\nwere, paying for nothing, and invariably leaving utter desolation and\r\ndestitution in their rear. Distress and discontent ravaged Rome. Winter\r\nstorms brought Tiber down in flood and the City was under water. So the\r\nyear 1495 ended.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the new year, Don Virginio Orsini joined the French\r\nin Naples, against the King Don Ferrandino II, the Pope and Venice. At\r\nAtella the French were defeated, and the Holy League grew powerful.\r\nEngland joined it. The Lord Alexander P.P. VI, who, with His magnificent\r\nability for doing many things, had been superintending the decoration of\r\nthe quire of Santa Maria _del Populo_ by the Flaminian Gate which opens\r\non the great north road, (the nearest gate to England), went, with a\r\nsolemn cavalcade, to hold a papal chapel for publishing the Bull of\r\nAlliance with King Henry VII Tudor. France had no friend save Florence,\r\nwhere the Signoria had taken upon itself to remove the inhibition from\r\nFra Girolamo Savonarola. That incontinent friar preached a course of\r\nLenten sermons defending himself, violently denouncing Rome,\r\nparticularizing certain vices which everywhere were general. His\r\nincorrigible attitude appears like “the rage of a man who knows that he\r\nhas chosen the lower when he might have chosen the higher.” He was in\r\nopen revolt, not against the Catholic Faith, but against the laws of the\r\nland, and the Rule of the Religion of St Dominic to which, voluntarily,\r\nunder no compulsion whatever, he had chosen to swear allegiance on the\r\nSacrament of the Lord’s Body. To make things easy for him, the Pope’s\r\nHoliness proposed to erect a new Dominican Congregation which he might\r\nbe willing to obey, under Cardinal Carafa who already had given evidence\r\nof his sympathy with the friar. But Fra Girolamo intractably refused to\r\nhear: and it must be said that the minacity and violence, with which he\r\nattacked his superiors, form a bitter contrast to the patience and\r\nmoderation which the Lord Alexander P.P. VI extended to him, in this—and\r\nlet this be noted—the third year of his disgraceful extravagance and\r\ndisloyalty.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the Fourth Consistory of the twenty-first of January 1496, the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI named one cardinal, who was\r\n\r\n  The Lord Philippe de Luxembourg; Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of\r\n      San Marcellino e San Pietro.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe condition of the country improved as the year 1496 expanded. An\r\nill-advised attempt of the Elect-Emperor Maximilian to revive the waning\r\nImperial power by a progress through the Italian realms, was averted by\r\nthe opposition of Venice and the remonstrances of the Sovereign Pontiff.\r\nThe Elect-Emperor having withdrawn into the Tyrol, the Lord Alexander\r\nP.P. VI was free to deal with the Pontifical States. The Regno\r\nflourished under the young King Don Ferrandino II, and the French\r\noccupation was becoming a thing of the past. Only the rebellious vassals\r\nof the Holy See remained; and, of these, Colonna and Savelli appear to\r\nhave made their submission; but the Orsini were still in arms, and\r\nMalatesta, Riario, Manfredi, and Sforza, were fortified at Cesena, Imola\r\nand Forli, Faenza and Pesaro.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the Fifth Consistory of the nineteenth of February 1496, the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI named four Spanish cardinals, who were\r\n\r\n  (α) The Lord Don Bartolomeo Martino, Bishop of Segovia;\r\n        Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Sant’ Agata _in Suburra_:\r\n\r\n  (β) The Lord Don Juan de Castro, Prefect of Santangelo, Bishop of\r\n        Girgenti, (Άκραγαντῖνος) in Sicily; Cardinal-Presbyter of the\r\n        Title of Santa Prisca:\r\n\r\n  (γ) The Lord Don Juan Lopez, Canon of the Vatican Basilica, Apostolic\r\n        Datary; Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Maria _in\r\n        Trastevere, tit. Callisto_:\r\n\r\n  (δ) The Lord Giovanni Borgia (detto Giuniore), a Pontifical Nephew,\r\n        Bishop of Melfi; Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Maria\r\n        _in Via Lata_.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAppointing His bastard, Don Juan Francisco de Lançol y Borja, as\r\nCaptain-General of the pontifical army, and assisted by the Majesty of\r\nNaples, the Lord Alexander P.P. VI proceeded to reduce Orsini. At the\r\nopening of the campaign, Don Virginio Orsini was captured by the\r\nNeapolitans; but when Orsini’s stronghold of Bracciano was relieved by\r\nDon Vitellozzo Vitelli of Città di Castello, the papal condottieri were\r\nforced to raise the siege. And before the end of the year the Pope lost\r\nHis ally King Don Ferrandino II, who died at the age of twenty-eight\r\n“worn out with fatigue and with the pleasures of his marriage to his\r\naunt Joanna whom he loved too passionately.” (Symonds, Renascence, I.\r\n513.) The year 1497 began with the defeat of the papal troops by Orsini\r\nat the battle of Soviano, a reverse which was counterbalanced by the\r\nsuccess of Don Gonsalvo de Cordova. This captain was at the head of a\r\nband of mercenaries sent by Spain in aid of the Papacy; he took the\r\nfortress of Ostia from Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, whose five years\r\nof treachery and recalcitrancy were now punished by the Holiness of the\r\nPope, with deprivation of his benefices (which took from him the “sinews\r\nof war”) and the deposition of his brother, Don Giovanni della Rovere,\r\nfrom the Prefecture of Rome. As for the French Orators who made protest\r\nat this unaccountably long-delayed act of precautionary\r\njustice,—unaccountably-long-delayed, except on the hypothesis of this\r\nPope’s singular patience, long-suffering, and dislike of proceeding to\r\nextremities,—the Supreme Pontiff contemptuously remarked that they were\r\ncome from an Excommunicated King; and that it was well for them that\r\nCardinal Cesare (detto Borgia) did not hear them. This, by the bye, is\r\nthe first instance of the amazing influence which that young Porporato\r\nwas beginning to attain, an influence which within the next few years\r\nincreased by leaps and bounds until the name of Cesare (detto Borgia)\r\nstood among the most important names in Europe.\r\n\r\nFurther to emphasize the slight to France by shewing His appreciation of\r\nSpain’s support, the Lord Alexander P.P. VI decorated His bastard, Don\r\nJuan Francisco de Lançol y Borja Duke of Gandia and Prince of Teano and\r\nTricarico, as representing the Spanish branch of His House, with the\r\ntitles of Count of Chiaramonte, Lauria, and Cerignuola, Tyrant of\r\nBenevento and Tarracina, and Grand Constable of Naples.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn honour of her son’s good fortune, Madonna Giovanna de’ Catanei gave a\r\nsupper at her villa by San Pietro _ad Vincula_, where were present the\r\nyoung Duke of Gandia of the age of twenty-two years, and Cardinal Cesare\r\n(detto Borgia) his senior by a year. Their sister Madonna Lucrezia, who\r\nhad had much unpleasantness with her husband, Don Giovanni Sforza the\r\nTyrant of Pesaro, had left him; and was living in the Convent of San\r\nSisto in Rome, as noble ladies do who wish to guard their reputations in\r\ndelicate circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen supper was over, and the night advancing, the Cardinal advised\r\nDon Juan that it was time to return to the Vatican where they lodged.\r\nIn view of the popular delusions concerning this occurrence, it may be\r\nadvisable to refer to the fact that sunset was taken to end a\r\ntwenty-four hours day; that “one hour of the night,” _i.e._, one hour\r\nafter sunset, was the fashionable supper-time, which at this time of\r\nthe year (the fourteenth of June) would be about 9 P.M. Before\r\nmidnight then, at a generous computation, the Cardinal and the Duke of\r\nGandia mounted their horses and rode through Rome together as far as\r\nthe palace of the Vicechancellor attended by a small escort. It is\r\nworth noting that the palace of the Vicechancellor was not the\r\nCancelleria, the palace of the Chancery at San Lorenzo _in Damaso_,\r\nperhaps the most beautiful palace in the world, which Messer Bramante\r\nLazzari built for the white-faced Cardinal Rafaele Galeotto\r\nSanzoni-Riario: but the new palace built by Cardinal Rodrigo de Lançol\r\ny Borja, and given by him after His election to the Supreme\r\nPontificate, to the Vicechancellor-Cardinal Ascanio Maria\r\nSforza-Visconti; (now Palazzo Sforza-Cesarini on Banchi Vecchi).\r\n\r\nThere, the ardent Duke (he already was married to a princess of Spain,\r\nand the father of two children,) said to the Cardinal that, before going\r\nhome, he wanted to amuse himself somewhere; and, taking leave of the\r\nsaid Most Worshipful Lord, and dismissing his suite with the exception\r\nof a certain bully whom he kept, he took on his crupper an unknown man\r\nin a mask who waited there, and who daily during a month had come to see\r\nhim at the Vatican, as well as on this very night during the supper in\r\nthe garden of his mother. Then he turned his horse in the direction of\r\nthe Jews’ Quarter, (there was no Ghetto till 1556), and disappeared in\r\nthe twilight of a midsummer night. He never again was seen alive.\r\n\r\nWhen the City awoke in the morning, (Romans always were early risers,)\r\nthe Duke of Gandia’s bully was found on Piazza Giudei, wounded by the\r\nsteel of an assassin; and all efforts to obtain information from him\r\nproved futile. He died without having spoken.\r\n\r\nThe news trickled into the Vatican, and was mentioned to the Pope; who\r\nthought that perhaps Don Juan was staying with some courtesan, wishing\r\nout of consideration for his Father to avoid the scandal of being seen\r\nto issue from such a house in open day. But when night came again, and\r\nthe Duke did not appear, the Pope’s Holiness took alarm; and ordered an\r\ninquisition and the usual dragging of Tiber. The wags of Rome instantly\r\nsaid that, notwithstanding all that Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere had\r\nalleged concerning the election of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI as being\r\nsimoniacal, it was now certain that He was a true Successor of St. Peter\r\nas a Fisher of men.\r\n\r\nAmong other bearers of news, there came to the inquisitors a certain\r\nGiorgio, of the Schiavoni, a waterman, asserting that, while guarding\r\nhis boat on Tiber during the night, he had seen two men, who came to the\r\nshore to look whether any one was there; behind them came two others\r\nmaking the same inspection. He, the speaker, being in the shadow of his\r\nbeached boat escaped all notice. When these four had assured themselves\r\nthat the place was empty, there came one on a white horse, conveying\r\nbehind him a dead man, whose feet and arms hung down, held by two\r\nfoot-men. Having come to the water’s edge, they turned the crupper of\r\nthe horse to the river; and, lifting the corpse, swung it into the\r\nstream. The rider looked on: but seeing a dark object which floated,—it\r\nwas the dead man’s cloak,—he ordered the others to throw stones at it\r\nuntil it sank.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing this tale, the Pope groaned, and reproached the waterman\r\nin that he did not give immediate notice to the bargelli (police) of the\r\ncrime which he had witnessed. The man impudently answered that he had\r\nseen such sights a thousand times: but never had he known of any one who\r\ncared to hear about them.\r\n\r\nThe Vicechancellor-Cardinal Ascanio Maria Sforza-Visconti wrote to his\r\nbrother the Duke of Milan, relating the deposition of Giorgio the\r\nwaterman, and the disquietude of the Pope.\r\n\r\nLater, the corpse was found in Tiber, completely clothed in the\r\nsumptuous garments of the Duke of Gandia, the dagger in its sheath, the\r\npouch intact adorned with jewels of great value. Eleven—some say\r\nfourteen—wounds, of which an enormous one was in the throat, were the\r\ncause of death. The unfortunate young Duke was buried at Santa Maria del\r\nPopolo. (_Maricont._) That, actually, is all that is known of the murder\r\nof the Duke of Gandia.\r\n\r\nThe only person, except the murderer or murderers, who could give any\r\nsalient information, was the bully; and he expired without uttering a\r\nword. The mystery of the unknown man in a mask has never been solved\r\n(nor the archives of a Roman patrician House published); and, for a\r\ntime, the matter rested there.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe effect upon the Lord Alexander P.P. VI was terrible. He had loved\r\nDon Juan Francisco with a very great love. Notwithstanding the fact that\r\nCardinal Cesare (detto Borgia) was a year older than the Duke of Gandia,\r\nthe Pope had always treated the latter as His heir[30]; and had foreseen\r\nin his vigorous manlihood the foundation of a dynasty of Grandees of\r\nSpain who would render more illustrious the House of Borja. The founding\r\nof a family has always been an object very near to the hearts of great\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAnd now the irruption of hideous and ruthless Death turned the Pope’s\r\nHoliness, for a moment, from a spiritual and temporal sovereign and\r\ndespot into a very human man. At such a moment, when man most poignantly\r\nis reminded of the Inevitable Universal waiting in the background, he\r\nfeels his utter helplessness, his entire unworthiness, and would\r\nappease, make satisfaction. Broken-hearted, the Lord Alexander P.P. VI\r\nspoke of abdication, and a change of life; as other famous men have\r\ndone, whom trouble, or fear, have driven to La Trappe. He made good\r\nresolutions. He gave munificent gifts to churches; for His revived piety\r\nmanifested itself in practical form. He appointed a Commission of six\r\ncardinals, including Cardinals Carafa and Costa, to reform\r\necclesiastical abuses. He named Cardinal Cesare (detto Borgia) as\r\nApostolic Legate for the pacification of Umbria. By way of restoring\r\nunity to Italy, He endeavoured to persuade Florence to annul her\r\nalliance with excommunicate France: in which admirable intent He was\r\nthwarted solely by the indescribable efforts of Fra Girolamo Savonarola,\r\nwho, during the Lent of this year, had preached in favour of unswerving\r\nsubservience to the Christian King. The Powers of Europe, especially\r\nEngland, the Holy Roman Empire, Venice, Naples, and Spain, who formed\r\nthe Holy League with the Papacy, on receiving official intimation of the\r\nPope’s bereavement and His bitter sorrow, sent Orators with suitable\r\nexpressions of condolence.\r\n\r\nDuring summer and autumn, which should have been occupied in drafting\r\nthe Bull of Reform (a task subsequently performed by the Council of\r\nTrent,) the Reform Commission had to study, and deal with, and advise\r\nthe Pontiff in, the more urgent case of the friar of Florence. Riots and\r\naffrays between the partisans and opponents of Fra Girolamo Savonarola\r\ndisgraced the Lily-City of Tuscany: and, at last, after more than four\r\nyears forbearance, all gentler measures having failed, he was placed\r\nunder sentence of excommunication.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Cardinal Cesare (detto Borgia) proceeded to Naples as\r\nApostolic Ablegate for the coronation of King Don Federigo de Aragona.\r\n(The Sword of State which was borne before His Worship on this occasion\r\nis in possession of Caïetani Duke of Sermoneta: but the scabbard of\r\nembossed leather is in the Victoria and Albert Museum.)\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn September 1497 the Lord Alexander P.P. VI published the creation of\r\none cardinal, whose name, for political reasons, He had reserved _in\r\npetto_ since the Second Consistory of September 1493, who was\r\n\r\n  The Lord Don Luis de Aragona, son of King Don Ferrando I;\r\n      Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Maria _in Cosmediv_. (He\r\n      was commonly called “The Cardinal of Aragon.”)\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the incoming of winter arrived an opportunity for the enemies of the\r\nLord Alexander P.P. VI to blaspheme.\r\n\r\nMadonna Lucrezia Borgia was living in the Convent of San Sisto,\r\nseparated from her husband, Don Giovanni Sforza the Tyrant of Pesaro;\r\nand seeking a decree of nullity of marriage, alleging a canonical\r\nimpediment. This young man was cousin to the Duke of Milan, very\r\nhandsome in person, and intelligent. He already had been married to\r\nMadonna Maddalena Gonzaga, who in 1490 had died _di cattivo parto_\r\n(Gregorovius). In 1493, being then in his twenty-sixth year, he had\r\nmarried Madonna Lucrezia, from whose Father he held his Tyranny of\r\nPesaro by way of fief, consolidating the alliance of Sforza and Borgia.\r\nHe had most of the advantages of life, illustrious birth, rank, youth,\r\nhealth, a splendid position, intimate relationship with his feudal lord,\r\nand a wife acknowledged by all contemporaries as the most beautiful\r\nwoman of her time: and now, after little more than three years, he was\r\nto be held up to the derision of all by the annulment of his marriage on\r\nthe score of αδῆνᾶμία.\r\n\r\nNothing, at any time is more certain to enrage a man than this; and, in\r\nthe Fifteenth Century, the Century of the Discovery of Man, when ἀvδpeίa\r\nwas prized and worshipped, a charge which made him look ridiculous in\r\nthe estimation of his species, which struck at the very root of his\r\nmanlihood, was sure to be furiously resented. When his wife left him to\r\nenter her petition, Don Giovanni Sforza sped to Milan invoking the\r\nsupport of his kin, the Vicechancellor-Cardinal Ascanio Maria\r\nSforza-Visconti and the Duke Ludovico Maria (detto Il Moro). On news\r\nreaching them to the effect that evidence had been given before the\r\nlegal tribunal in Rome, which proved the marriage to lack consummation\r\nand Madonna Lucrezia to be παρθένος ἀδμήτη, he violently protested, and\r\nwith unrestrained rancour. Don Beltrando Costabili, the Orator of\r\nFerrara, writing from Milan to his government, asserted that Don\r\nGiovanni said to Duke Ludovico Maria, “Anzi haverla conosciuta infinite\r\nvolte, ma chel Papa non gliela tolta per altro se non per usare con\r\nlei.” It is most improbable that a reigning sovereign would admit a\r\nforeign ambassador to a discussion of his family affairs; and unless\r\nCostabili actually heard those words, they can only be accepted as a\r\npiece of gossip reported, not as legal evidence. Duke Ludovico Maria\r\ningenuously proposed to Don Giovanni an ordeal which, in that naive age,\r\nwas usual in similar cases, of submitting formally and publicly to the\r\njudgment of a jury of men of bonafides and the papal legate: and, on his\r\nrefusal, his own relations, the Duke and the thin-faced clear-witted\r\nVicechancellor-Cardinal, obtained from him a written confession that\r\nMadonna Lucrezia was justified in her petition, and advised him to let\r\nthe law take its course. The case of a man temporarily άδύνατος at the\r\nage of Don Giovanni physiologically is no uncommon one. Much has been\r\nmade of the circumstances under which his first wife died, and of the\r\nfact that his third, Madonna Ginevra de’ Tiepoli, bore him a son, Don\r\nCostanzo Sforza, eight years later (1505). As for the infernal calumny\r\nagainst the Pope’s Holiness, Don Giovanni Sforza was its inventor, says\r\nthe Orator of Ferrara, and the mortifying humiliation of a libidinous\r\nlaughing-stock its proximate occasion. On the twentieth of December\r\n1497, the decree of nullity of the marriage was published in Rome, the\r\nTyrant of Pesaro refunded the lady’s dowry of thirty thousand ducats;\r\nand Madonna Lucrezia Borgia was free.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe cause of the visit to Milan of the Vicechancellor-Cardinal Ascanio\r\nMaria Sforza-Visconti, at this time, was that he had come under most\r\nundeserved suspicion of having been connected with the murder of the\r\nDuke of Gandia. Bitter as it must have been to the Pope’s Holiness to\r\nsuspect his oldest friend, at least the latter’s recent treachery with\r\nColonna made estrangement unavoidable. The Vicechancellor retired to\r\nGennazano by Praeneste, (Palestrina), a fief of Colonna, ostensibly to\r\nworship Madonna of Good Counsel. An investigation of his Roman palace\r\nduring his absence was without fruit; and, angered at the suspicion, he\r\nhad retired to Milan, where his unprejudiced and straightforward action\r\nin the matter of the nullity, at a time when he naturally went in\r\ndisgust of Borgia, should go a long way in favour, not only of his own\r\nbonafides, but also of that of the Lord Alexander P. P. VI.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSavonarola’s attitude toward the sentence of excommunication that had\r\nbeen launched against him, was incorrigible. His influence caused the\r\nSignoria of Florence unsuccessfully to appeal to the Pope’s Holiness for\r\nthe withdrawal of the Brief; and the friar accompanied this appeal with\r\nan open defiance. On Christmas Day he sang the three high masses at San\r\nMarco, and announced the resumption of his frenzied discourses. The\r\nphysiognomy of this mattoid is the key to the secret of his\r\nmisbehaviour. He was cast in the mould of the animal-man. He had the\r\nlong head with immense hinder development, the great thick nose, the\r\nenormous lower lip, coarse mouth, and heavy jowl, of a ram. Above all,\r\nin him the little lateral muscles of the nose-root were of opulent\r\ngrowth, a sign which is unmistakable. But, contrariwise, the narrow\r\ntemples with their overhanging brows pointed in the middle, struck the\r\nnote of ideality, and conquered the animalism of the man. It was this\r\ncataclysmal violence of difference, this trenchant contrast, that made\r\nhim what he was. In him there were two inimical characters, the\r\ncharacter of the saint, the character of the ram. That of the saint\r\nvanquished that of the ram: but the poignant struggle overthrew the\r\nmental balance of the saint. His proper place was not the Convent of San\r\nMarco in Florence: but the Hospital of Santo Spirito in Rome.[31]\r\n\r\nSo in sorrow, in anger, in horrid uncertainty, the year 1497 ended.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the coronation of Don Federigo de Aragona as King of Naples,\r\nCardinal Cesare (detto Borgia) announced a determination which he had\r\nnourished since the murder of the Duke of Gandia. Whether he was the\r\nPope’s bastard or another’s, it was his pose to aggrandise the House of\r\nBorgia; moreover he was young, only twenty-four years of age, and of an\r\nardent and forceful habit of mind and body. Don Gioffredo Borgia was\r\noccupied with his wife Madonna Sancia de Aragona and his principality of\r\nSquillace; and his age of seventeen years did not render him a capable\r\nrepresentative of his illustrious House. Cardinal Cesare felt that his\r\nscarlet hat debarred him from the pursuits for which Nature had devised\r\nhim. The foes of Borgia were active on all sides: the territories of the\r\nHoly See were a hot-bed of revolt. Sforza sulked in Milan; Orsini, never\r\nforgetful of injury, entrenched themselves in their strongholds; their\r\nfierce brigands ravaged the country far and wide: and there was no\r\nBorgia to hold them in check. Wherefore Cardinal Cesare requested leave\r\nto renounce his cardinalate, to receive secular rank, to marry a royal\r\nprincess, that he might be free to adopt a military career, and to\r\nperpetuate the Borgia dynasty. It was an extraordinary plan: but, though\r\nit presented advantages of high political value, it was opposed and\r\nshelved by the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, whose behaviour to Cardinal\r\nCesare was never that of a father, but of a patron and benefactor who\r\npatronized, and benefited, him for the sake of another than himself.\r\nYet, though the attitude of the Pope to the Cardinal was one of\r\nlife-long distinct antipathy, He set immense value on his advancement,\r\nand incurred peril and made sacrifices to promote it. What was the\r\nmotive of conduct which presents such contradictory features? Is it\r\npossible that Cardinal Cesare was the son of Madonna Giovanna de’\r\nCatanei, not by Cardinal Rodrigo de Lançol y Borja, but by the eternal\r\nrival of the last, Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere? It is extremely\r\npossible and extremely probable. Cardinal Rodrigo undoubtedly had loved\r\nMadonna Giovanna very greatly since 1474. She undoubtedly was the mother\r\nof Cardinal Cesare, who was born in 1474. She had had relations with\r\nCardinal Giuliano before that. And Cardinal Rodrigo never acknowledged\r\nthe paternity of Cardinal Cesare, although he never denied it. The\r\ntheory, which lacks not some proof (to be given in a proper place),\r\nwould explain the unconquerable malice of Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere\r\ntowards the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, Who had deprived him of his mistress\r\nas well as of the triregno, the object of his ultimate ambition; and the\r\nloathing of the Pope’s Holiness for His enemy’s bastard, whom He, at the\r\nsame time held as a hostage to be used against Cardinal Giuliano in an\r\nextremity, feared for his incorrigible and antipathetic disposition, and\r\nadvanced and enriched for the love which He had borne to his mother.\r\nThat is the only rational explanation of certain mysteries which,\r\notherwise, remain inexplicable.\r\n\r\nThe proposal of Cardinal Cesare (detto Borgia) had many recommendations.\r\nThe lax and feeble government of the late Pope, the Lord Innocent P.P.\r\nVIII, had played havoc with order in the vast domain of Umbria, of the\r\nMark of Ancona, of the Romagna, that splendid realm in north-eastern\r\nItaly verging on the Adriatic Sea. A few strong men, tyrants of petty\r\nfiefs, threw off allegiance to the Pope as their Over-Lord. Don\r\nOliverotto da Fermo, a brigand of the worst kind, made himself Tyrant of\r\nFermo by the simple process of assassinating his uncle, Don Giovanni\r\nFogliani, and all the chief citizens, at a banquet. Don Vitellozzo\r\nVitelli garrisoned Citta di Castello, Don Paolo Orsini was fortified at\r\nSinigaglia, Madonna Caterina Sforza-Riario at Imola and Forli, the Oddi\r\nand Baglioni at Perugia, the Manfredi at Faenza, the Varani at Camerino,\r\nthe Bentivogli at Bologna. Safe in their strongholds these Tyrants paid\r\nno dues, no feudal tribute to their Lord Paramount. From time to time\r\nthey sallied forth with armed condottieri to replenish their stores from\r\nthe pillage of towns and villages. The province was ravaged from end to\r\nend by their excesses. In the Library of San Marco at Venice may be read\r\nletters (Lat. Cl. x. 176) which report on the condition of Umbria when\r\nthe Lord Alexander P.P. VI began His reign; a condition of horror\r\nunspeakable, which He was determined to abolish.\r\n\r\nTo this end, He had sent Cardinal Cesare (detto Borgia) as Apostolic\r\nLegate into Umbria, in the summer of 1497, just a month after the murder\r\nof the Duke of Gandia. The Legate went unarmed save by his sacred\r\noffice, and with too small an escort for offence. The idea was to test\r\nthe moral authority of the Suzerain of Umbria, the Roman Pontiff, in a\r\nplace where the civil power practically was helpless, and where a man’s\r\nlife depended only on the fear which he inspired.\r\n\r\nOn the day of his arrival at Narni, the sixteenth of July 1497, Cardinal\r\nCesare already had formed an opinion which he communicated to the Pope’s\r\nHoliness in these words: “It is very necessary to provide me with an\r\narmy against these kakodaimones; for they go not out by holy water.”[32]\r\n\r\nThe brigand Don Bartolomeo d’Alviano seized a town belonging to the Pope\r\nin despite of the Legate, and sacked it before his face. Cardinal Cesare\r\nsummoned him to keep the peace: he refused; and matters went from bad to\r\nworse.\r\n\r\n“They offend as they did at first, and will not hearken unto my\r\ncommandments”;[33] he wrote to the Pope eleven days later.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Todi fled from their town to save their lives.\r\nBrigandage was in its hey-day. “Your Holiness can well understand that\r\nthe only remedy for these evils lies in the coming of men of arms, whose\r\ndelay has caused Todi to be desolated and the city, from my departure\r\ntill now, totally derelict and left empty.”[34] At Perugia, the Legate\r\ntook the bull by the horns in a singularly daring manner and with\r\nsingular success; putting the more uproarious of the ringleaders under\r\nthe ban of expulsion, “which thing was done with such obedience and calm\r\nthat nothing better could be desired.”[35]\r\n\r\nBut he did better than that. He caught a murderer in flagrante delicto.\r\n“I captured two robbers and murderers; and with no tumult, but to the\r\ndelight of the people, they were put in gaol—a thing long unknown in\r\nthis city—and this morning I hanged one.”[36]\r\n\r\n’Twas immense. There was no tumult, and the people were pleased. That a\r\nmurderer should pay a penalty for his crime was a charming and fantastic\r\nnovelty to Perugia. The strong arm of the law struck the city with\r\nconsternation, and deeds of violence ceased as though by magic. In this\r\nmanner Cardinal Cesare (detto Borgia) gave a taste of his quality; and\r\ncame before the world, for the first time, in the rôle which Nature\r\nintended him to fill, with his splendid personality, and swift unerring\r\npitiless masterfulness of action.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution of this work was prevented by the condition of affairs\r\nin Rome. It was impossible for the Holiness of the Pope to gather an\r\narmy while the marriage of Madonna Lucrezia was before the courts, and\r\nthe frenzy of Fra Girolamo Savonarola before the Reform Commission.\r\nCardinal Cesare, also, was required for other service.\r\n\r\nBut now, at the beginning of 1498, after the coronation of King Don\r\nFederigo, at the close of his legation to Naples, Cardinal Cesare\r\nreverted to the work begun the year before; and preferred his petition\r\nfor leave to doff the scarlet of an ecclesiastic, and to embark on a\r\nsecular career. The news was bruited about Rome on the eighth of\r\nFebruary. Four days later, on the twelfth, the Ferrarese Orator at\r\nVenice heard it said that Cardinal Cesare was the murderer of the Duke\r\nof Gandia, and that His Worship and Madonna Lucrezia Borgia were seeking\r\nmatrimonial alliances with the Royal House of Naples. Four days would be\r\nexceedingly quick travelling for a piece of gossip from Rome to Venice,\r\nwhen news was carried by mounted couriers, or a-foot, and would have to\r\npass through the Romagna hell: and it is also most important to note\r\nthat this suspicion was not published till eight months after the\r\nmurder; and, then, in Venice. No evidence was offered to support it. It\r\nemanated from the numerous Orsini whom Venice sheltered, and who said\r\nthat Cardinal Cesare had killed the Duke in order that he might take his\r\nplace as the Pope’s soldier-son. Once started, the accusation was\r\nrepeated by Cappello the twenty-eighth of September 1500; and by Don\r\nSilvio Savelli in November 1501; three and four years after the event:\r\nnor does it lack repetition by cheap and showy panderers to a guileless\r\npublic fond of having its flesh made to creep at the present day. All\r\nthat is known of the murder already has been set down here. But one\r\nvital consideration remains to be stated, one new point of view to be\r\ndescribed; and it is due to the rumour of Orsini invention mentioned\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nAccording to Monsignor Hans Burchard the Caerimonarius, Cardinal Cesare\r\nand the Duke of Gandia parted, on the night of the fourteenth of June\r\n1497, by the Vicechancellor’s palace (Palazzo Sforza-Cesarini) on Banchi\r\nVecchi; whence the latter, saying that he was going to amuse himself,\r\netc., went in the direction of the Jews’ Quarter with his two\r\nattendants, the bully, and the unknown mask who undeniably had come by\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nRome of 1497 was divided for purposes of government into fourteen\r\nRegions (Rioni) ruled by captains (caporioni) under a prior. The\r\nVicechancellor’s palace on Banchi Vecchi is in the Region called Ponte,\r\nwhich extends from the church of San Giovanni de’ Fiorentini to the\r\nRegion called Santangelo after the church of that dedication in the\r\nFishmarket (Pescheria). Now this Region of Ponte was inhabited chiefly\r\nby the Orsini faction; as the region of Trevi and the Region of Ripa\r\nwere inhabited by the Colonna and Savelli factions respectively. In this\r\nRegion of Ponte lived also Jews: it was the quarter of the bankers and\r\nthe money-changers, as well as of the prisons, public and private\r\ntorture-chambers, (no evidence was taken from commoners except under\r\ntorture,) all under the official protection of the House of Orsini. Here\r\nis Cord Lane (Vicolo della Corda), where the ordinary Question or\r\nTorture of the Cord[37] was applied. Here is Old Pillory Square, (Piazza\r\ndella Berlèna Vecchia.) Here is Executioner Lane, (Vicolo dello Mastro.)\r\nAnd here were four Orsini fortresses, Monte Giordano, Tor Millina, Tor\r\nSanguigna, and Torre di Nona. The Region of Santangelo, also, almost\r\nexclusively was inhabited by Jews under the protection of Orsini who\r\nheld yet another palace-fortress here in the Theatre of Marcellus,\r\n(formerly the stronghold of the great mediæval Jewish House of\r\nPierleoni,) near by the site on which the Ghetto was built in 1556 under\r\nthe Lord Paul P.P. IV, and abolished in 1890 under the Lord Leo P.P.\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nThese topographical facts appear to point in one direction. A conclusion\r\nmay be reached by the following degrees.\r\n\r\n  (α) The Duke of Gandia took eleven (or fourteen) wounds.\r\n\r\n  (β) His pouch with its precious jewels was intact.\r\n\r\n  (γ) He had parted from Cardinal Cesare before witnesses in Banchi\r\n        Vecchi.\r\n\r\n  (δ) He said that he was going to amuse himself.\r\n\r\n  (ε) He went towards the Jews’ Quarter.\r\n\r\n  (ζ) Cardinal Cesare returned to the Vatican.\r\n\r\n  (η) Banchi Vecchi is in Ponte, the Region of Jews and of Orsini.\r\n\r\n  (θ) The Jews’ Quarter _stricte dicte_ was in Santangelo, a Region also\r\n        dominated by Orsini.\r\n\r\n  (ι) The Orsini were in mortal strife with the Lord Alexander P.P. VI,\r\n        Who had visited them with appalling disaster, Who was likely to\r\n        cause them infinite loss of life and spoil in the near future,\r\n        Whose favourite son, heir, _and military right hand_, was the\r\n        Duke of Gandia.\r\n\r\n  (κ) It was Orsini who started the rumour, eight months later, that\r\n        Cardinal Cesare (of whom Orsini went in horrid fear by reason of\r\n        his exploits in the Romagna) had murdered the Duke of Gandia.\r\n\r\nThe human and natural conclusion would seem to be that Don Juan\r\nFrancisco de Lançol y Borja, Duke of Gandia, Prince of Teano and of\r\nTricarico, Count of Chiaramonte of Lauria of Cerignuola, Tyrant of\r\nBenevento of Tarracina, Grand Constable of Naples, _and Captain-General\r\nof the pontifical army against Orsini_, living apart from his wife Doña\r\nMaria de Aragona who was with his two children at his duchy in Spain,\r\nbeing a handsome pleasure-loving youth of twenty-two years, went to keep\r\nan assignation on that night of the fourteenth of June 1497; and fell by\r\nthe furious dagger of one of Orsini’s Jews, a rival? a father? an\r\noutraged husband?—or by the vengeful poignards of his own and his\r\nFather’s deadly foes, the Orsini.\r\n\r\nThe great number of his wounds, the safety of his valuables, may be thus\r\naccounted for. The unknown mask would be the decoy, disguised as pandar.\r\nThe murder of the bully speaks of more assassins than one.\r\n\r\nThen, did not Orsini strike at the heart of the Pope in the slaughter of\r\nHis eldest son?\r\n\r\nAt all events, no formal accusation of the guilt of this most foul and\r\ntreacherous crime has ever been laid against Cardinal Cesare (detto\r\nBorgia.) There is absolutely no evidence against him—only suspicion,\r\nrumour and conjecture. And the three spring from a tainted source—the\r\nlair of the Bear—Orsini.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPlans for the settlement of the Romagna had to be set aside. The affair\r\nof Fra Girolamo Savonarola monopolized the attention of the moment.\r\n\r\nThat friar began the year 1498 by preaching a fierce defence of his\r\ndisobedience to the inhibition and to the sentence of excommunication;\r\nand by a frenetic onslaught on the Roman as distinguished from the\r\nTuscan clergy. The Lord Alexander P.P. VI, the acknowledged Head of the\r\nChristian Church, (indeed He was the _only_ representative of\r\nChristianity in Authority at that time) found Himself in the position of\r\na commander-in-chief dealing with a mutinous mad sergeant whom captains,\r\ncolonels, and generals have failed to reduce to order. The Pope’s\r\nmoderation and long-suffering, prior to his allowing the law to take its\r\ncourse, are perfectly marvellous. Fra Girolamo had been in a state of\r\nmutiny for more than four years. Preaching the duty of obedience, he\r\nwould not practise it. He was totally insensible to the many graces with\r\nwhich he had been indulged; and he met all overtures for peace with\r\nevasion or with insolence. After all, he was “a man under authority,”\r\nunder authority to which voluntarily he had vowed, and refused,\r\nsubmission while admitting the right of that authority to claim it:—an\r\nanomalous position, illogical, scandalous,—the position of a mad man. To\r\nthe Signoria of Florence, then, the Lord Alexander P.P. VI issued a\r\nBrief commanding the withdrawal of support from the excommunicated\r\nfriar; threatening Florence with an Interdict (a hideous lash that\r\ninvariably brought curs to heel) if His commandment were disobeyed: but,\r\nat the same time, offering to absolve the rebellious son of St. Dominic,\r\nupon submission. The Signoria replied, defending Savonarola; and the\r\nPope’s Holiness replied that, either he must be imprisoned, or be sent\r\nto Rome: a decision which was explained at greater length to the\r\nSignoria by the Florentine Orator in Rome, who also described the Pope’s\r\nnatural feelings of embitterment at finding His reasonable demands so\r\nspurned and set aside. Half measures only were taken. The Lord Alexander\r\nP.P. VI justly was dissatisfied when the Signoria simply forbade the\r\nfriar to preach. His Holiness commanded, then, the entire vindication of\r\nHis supreme authority.\r\n\r\nHere, Fra Girolamo Savonarola committed his final sin. He joined in the\r\nstale howl appealing to the Powers of Europe for the convocation of a\r\nGeneral Council; and he redoubled his treacherous intrigues with the\r\nChristian King Charles VIII: completing the exasperation of the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI.\r\n\r\nEvents moved swiftly then. Defying the commands of his acknowledged\r\nsuperior, the Pope, as well as the injunctions of the Signoria, he fell\r\non disrepute. His influence in Florence waned and withered; his\r\nprophecies fell thick and fast on no believers: and then the Signoria\r\ninsisted on his submission to the Pope.\r\n\r\nHe replied by demanding the Ordeal Of Fire; offering to walk through a\r\nblazing furnace with one of the many who opposed him, the person who\r\nshould take no hurt from that Ordeal to be adjudged innocent and under\r\nthe special protection of God.\r\n\r\nFra Francesco of Apulia a Friar Minor (a Religion always bitterly\r\nantipathetic to the Religion of St. Dominic) accepted the challenge thus\r\nthrown down. He said that he knew that both parties to the Ordeal would\r\nbe burned to death: but it would be better so, than that one heresiarch\r\nshould be left free to carry on his treasons to Christ’s Church and\r\nState.\r\n\r\nAgain Fra Girolamo Savonarola put forth an evasion. He refused, after\r\nchallenging—he refused the Ordeal in his proper person: but he offered\r\none of his friars of San Marco, one Fra Domenico, as his representative.\r\n\r\nFrom Rome the practical common sense of the Pope’s Holiness fulminated\r\ndisapproval: but the Ordeal went on. Faggots were piled in the great\r\nsquare of Florence, and set in flame. The skin of the faces of the crowd\r\ngrew hot and scarlet and crackled in the glare. The Friar Minor came\r\nforward in readiness to die for the good of the people. Fra Girolamo\r\nmade delays—delays—he said that Fra Domenico must bear our\r\nLord-in-the-Sacrament, the Sacred Host, Gesù Sagramentato, in an\r\nostensorium through the raging flames. The pious simple souls of the\r\nSignoria knew this for irreverence, for sacrilege; retired to discuss\r\nthe point; returned; refused permission. Fra Girolamo persisted while\r\nthe fire burned lower. The long slow day was passing. Already his\r\ndictatorship, the day when he ruled Florence with a word, had passed.\r\nThe fire was dying: and then, finally, except upon his own mad terms,\r\nFra Girolamo refused the Ordeal which he had challenged, evaded,\r\ndelayed, denied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fra Girolamo Savonarola_]\r\n\r\nAll faith in him was gone. Objurgated by a thousand raucous throats,\r\ntorn at by a thousand furious hands, the people’s broken idol sought\r\nrefuge in his Convent of San Marco. Florence rose in riot, blood was\r\nshed, the blood of Francesco Valori in cold murder. The Convent of San\r\nMarco suffered storm; and the friars with their mattoid Prior were cast\r\nin prison.\r\n\r\nIn the interests of justice and of mercy, the Pope’s Holiness strove to\r\nhave their trial held in Rome: but events had roused the Signoria to\r\nvindicate the honour of Florence “to satisfy the people who so long had\r\nbeen duped and trained in sacrilege and rebellion.” Wherefore, from Rome\r\ncame Commissioners for the trial of Fra Girolamo Savonarola and his\r\naccomplices. Put to the legal torture, he confessed himself charlatan\r\nand criminal. He and his lieutenants, Frati Domenico and Silvestro, were\r\nfound guilty as heretics, schismatics, and rebels against the Holy See,\r\nof political fanaticism amounting to high treason and mutiny against his\r\nlawful rulers. Handed to the secular judges for sentence, he was\r\ncondemned, with the two friars, to death by hanging and the burning of\r\ntheir bodies after death. Handed back to the ecclesiastical power the\r\nthree were degraded from their priesthood, to enable them to undergo the\r\ndeath penalty, avoiding the sacrilege of violence to the persons of\r\nthose tonsured and anointed. At the very last, by the express\r\ncommandment of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI there was offered to the\r\ncondemned a Plenary Indulgence-in-the-article-of-death, with release\r\nfrom all Canonical Censures and Excommunications. Gratefully,\r\nthankfully, it was accepted; and the prisoners paid the legal\r\nretribution of their crimes.\r\n\r\nHad he been an Englishman of the Twentieth Century, instead of a\r\nFlorentine of the Fifteenth, Fra Girolamo Savonarola would not have been\r\nhanged or burned: but censured; suspended, from the exercise of\r\nsacerdotal functions, by ecclesiastical authority; and, at last, by\r\nmedical authority, interned at Broadmoor during the Pleasure of the\r\nKing’s Majesty, as a criminal lunatic.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis year 1498, was born Don Giovanni Borgia, called “Infans Romanus”;\r\nwho was said to be a bastard of Cardinal Cesare (detto Borgia) by “a\r\nRoman spinster.”\r\n\r\nThis year also, died the twelve-toed chin-tufted excommunicated little\r\nChristian King Charles VIII of France; and was succeeded by his cousin\r\nLouis XII, a thin man with a fat neck and lip, and an Ethiopic nose, and\r\nexquisite attire, who immediately made two startling claims—for the\r\nnullification of his marriage with Madame Jeanne de Valois, and for the\r\nconfirmation of his claim to the Duchy of Milan. The Lord Alexander P.P.\r\nVI always preferred friends to enemies; and, now that Charles VIII was\r\ngone to his own place, He gladly welcomed an opportunity of winning the\r\nallegiance of France. A commission of jurists went from Rome, who, on\r\nthe legal facts, declared the marriage between the King and Madame\r\nJeanne to be null and void. A papal dispensation legalized the marriage\r\nof the Christian King Louis XII and Queen Anne, his predecessor’s widow,\r\nwhereby her duchy of Bretagne was retained to the crown of France. The\r\nclaim to the Duchy of Milan was a matter which required consideration.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the Sixth Consistory of the twelfth of September 1498, the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI named one cardinal, who was\r\n\r\n  the Lord Georges d’Amboise, Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the\r\n      Christian Kings Charles VIII and Louis XII; Cardinal-Presbyter of\r\n      the Title of San Sisto.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt last, the Pope’s Holiness consented to allow Cardinal Cesare (detto\r\nBorgia) to renounce the scarlet cardinalitial hat and the sapphire\r\ncardinalitial ring, for a secular duchy, a royal wife, and a military\r\ncareer; saying that his presence among the clergy was sufficient to\r\nprevent reformation.[38] A marriage was proposed for him with Doña\r\nCarlotta de Aragona Princess of Naples; but rejected by King Don\r\nFederigo, who at the same time favoured the marriage which took place\r\nbetween Madonna Lucrezia Borgia and Don Alonso de Aragona Prince of\r\nBisceglia. The plan of Cardinal Cesare was aided by fresh outbreaks at\r\nthe pontifical baronage, especially by a new league of Colonna and\r\nOrsini on behalf of Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere. Now, no more time\r\nwas lost. Don Cesare (detto Borgia) renounced his cardinalate in full\r\nconsistory; and journeyed into France to cultivate the friendship of the\r\nChristian King on behalf of the Papacy. New alliances were in the air.\r\nKing Louis XII saw no reason why he should remain in the ridiculous and\r\nparalysing isolation which the braggadocio of his predecessor had won.\r\nThe Pope’s Holiness was by no means secure with Naples whose King Don\r\nFederigo, though owing all to Him, was inclined to be obstreperous and\r\nto show contempt, and to whose dominions the Catholic King and Queen\r\nwere reaching. An alliance with the Papacy would suit the plans of\r\nFrance. An alliance with France would be of eminent service to the\r\nPapacy, at this moment when Colonna and Orsini were on the war-path, and\r\nthe Muslim Infidel stirring the East. So, the mission of Don Cesare\r\n(detto Borgia) met with great success; a working understanding was\r\narranged by his diplomacy; and the Christian King conferred on him the\r\nFrench Duchy of Valentinois.\r\n\r\nIt became evident that Milan must cede to France, the new ally of the\r\nLord Alexander P.P. VI; and this signified the final rupture of the\r\nalliance of Borgia and Sforza. First, firm friends; next, strong\r\nsupporters of the House of Borgia; then, indifferent neutrals; later,\r\ndeclared traitors; last, negligeable quantities; the conduct of the\r\nHouse of Sforza was influenced by one idea—loyalty to their name. It was\r\nthe head of the House who was responsible, Duke Ludovico Maria\r\nSforza-Visconti, a coward, a scoundrel, a traitor, a murderer in\r\nintention, the wretch who brought invading Frenchmen into Italy to aid\r\nhis usurpation of the throne of Milan—to him be all the blame. The\r\nVicechancellor-Cardinal Ascanio Maria Sforza-Visconti and all the Sforza\r\nof Pesaro, Santafiora, Chotignuola, Imola and Forli, followed the head\r\nof their House; and, as he led them astray, so he must be decried.\r\nSforza has produced cardinals a many; but never a Pope. Sforza was never\r\nnearer to the pontificate than in this reign. Ascanio was more than\r\nlikely to succeed the Lord Alexander—far more likely than the diabolical\r\nplebeian who did succeed. But Sforza followed the head of its House;\r\ncommitting political suicide. Loyalty in any age is rare: under all\r\ncircumstances it is heroic, admirable.\r\n\r\nFrom the Catholic King and Queen of Spain, Don Hernando and Doña\r\nIsabella, came the sometime pontifical captain Don Gonsalvo de Cordoba,\r\ncharged to scold the Holiness of the Pope because of His new alliance\r\nwith France. A very old weapon again was refurbished, and Catholic\r\nSpain, in fear or envy, menaced a Spanish Pontiff, Who had given her the\r\nNew World, with Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere’s stupid General Council.\r\nSo, in the shuffling of the cards, misery made strange bed-fellows\r\nacquainted.\r\n\r\nThen the Orient blazed with sudden war, and the Muslim Infidel began\r\nhostilities with Venice. Christendom had lost Lepanto[39]; the Turks\r\nwere intoxicated with success; and in Rome the Lord Alexander was deep\r\nin the scheme of a new Crusade when the year 1498 died.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNaples looked with sallow eyes on the amicable relations of the Papacy\r\nand France. The Christian King Louis XII married Duke Cesare de\r\nValentinois to Madame Charlotte, daughter of Sieur Alain d’Albret and\r\nsister of King Jean of Navarre; and then entered into a treaty with the\r\nVenetian Senate for the partition of the duchy of Milan. These acts were\r\ndiscomfiting to the Regno, which could only regard the triumph of its\r\nenemy and the ruin of its friend as auguries of evil fortune. For Duke\r\nCesare de Valentinois undoubtedly was the enemy of Naples now after the\r\nrejection of his suit to Doña Carlotta de Aragona, and in despite of the\r\nfact that his mother’s daughter, Madonna Lucrezia Borgia, was allied by\r\nmarriage to the Neapolitan Prince Don Alonso of Bisceglia. The fruit of\r\nthis last union was a son, born in November 1499, baptized in the\r\nXystine Chapel by the name Roderico after the August Father of Madonna\r\nLucrezia.\r\n\r\nTroubles were brewing for the Sforza. The Vicechancellor-Cardinal left\r\nRome, and the French invaded his brother’s duchy of Milan, driving Duke\r\nLudovico Maria Sforza-Visconti (detto Il Moro) to ignominious flight.\r\nEver ready to take advantage of the weakness of another Power, also ever\r\nready to be jealous of another Power’s success, Europe eyed the triumph\r\nof France with apprehension and disgust. And when the Lord Alexander\r\nP.P. VI shewed pleasure at the fall of Milan, Spain and Portugal in\r\ntheir chagrin sent Orators to annoy His Holiness with invectives against\r\nHis morals,[40] (as Satan sometimes denounces Sin,) and the validity of\r\nHis election,[41] demanding impossible reforms, and a General Council at\r\nthe Lateran. These petty incidents met the fate which they deserved. The\r\nLord Alexander P.P. VI magnificently and magnanimously received the\r\nenvoys in a public consistory, and made no efforts to prevent them from\r\nreciting their lessons. His Holiness invariably treated personalities\r\nwith good-humoured scorn; and bore the vented spleen of kings as a mere\r\nessential inconvenience of His rank, to be brushed away and forgotten\r\nwith the little muscarial nuisances of a Roman summer.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe year 1499, being the penultimate year of the Fifteenth Century, was\r\noccupied as far as the City was concerned with preparations for the\r\nJubilee; that curious ceremony wherewith the Church affords an\r\nopportunity to the faithful to cleanse their souls from stain of sin by\r\npenitence and pious works. Penitence is an affair entirely personal, to\r\nbe entreated of between a sinner and his Judge: but the Church, who\r\n(according to the Thirty Nine Articles) “hath power to ordain its rites\r\nand ceremonies,” prescribes the ceremonial works to be performed. In\r\nbrief, these works consist in certain visits to certain basilicas of\r\nRome, which must be entered by certain doors, and where certain prayers\r\nmust be prayed. The Church, being a system, is systematic. In return for\r\nthese works always supposing them to be accompanied by the appropriate\r\npenitence, She promises, from the infinite treasury of the Merits of our\r\nDivine Redeemer remission of the canonical punishment incurred, during\r\nhis past life, by the sinner now penitent and purposing amendment. This\r\nComplaisance on the part of the Church technically is called an\r\nIndulgence; and the Jubilee Indulgence is in high esteem and eager\r\nacceptation. It is not in any sense a licence to sin; as, by a\r\nsingularly silly misconception of its name,[42] it has been supposed to\r\nbe: but, absolutely, a formal wiping of the slate, a ceremonial enabling\r\nof the soul to start anew. The Jubilee begins on Christmas Day with the\r\nopening, by the Supreme Pontiff, of a certain door in the Vatican\r\nBasilica, which remains an ingress until the Christmas Day of the\r\ncentury-end; and vast pilgrimages are used to flock into the City at\r\nsuch times. The year 1499 saw erected accommodation for visitors in the\r\nBorgo Nuovo, and numerous improvements on the Vatican side of Tiber.\r\nChurches were restored and furbished, the Mola of Hadrian strengthened;\r\nand the new wing of the Apostolic Palace of the Vatican called the\r\nBorgia Tower, which the Lord Alexander P.P. VI had built, was decorated\r\nin fresco by the brush of Messer Bernardino Betti (detto Il\r\nPinturicchio).\r\n\r\nIn his book on the lives of artists which Giovanni Vasari wrote half a\r\ncentury later it is said that Il Pinturicchio painted on a wall of the\r\nBorgia Tower a picture of the Blessed Virgin Mary before whom the Borgia\r\nPontiff kneels in adoration. Vasari also says that the painter used, as\r\nhis model for Deipara, Madonna Giulia Orsini (nate Farnese) who was the\r\nPope’s mistress: and this statement is repeated by many, to this day,\r\nincluding the German historian Herr Gregorovius (who pretends to have\r\nbeen guided by documents and by documents alone), as an example of the\r\nflagitious profligacy and profanity of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI.\r\n\r\nPainters of the Fifteenth Century, in the manner of painters of the\r\nTwentieth, took their models as they found them. If the perpetuation of\r\nthe world’s loveliness be no sin,—and on that point there are\r\ndiversities of human opinion, and one Law,—then the person who is graced\r\nwith natural beauty incurs, not disgrace, but honour in allowing it to\r\nbe preserved by painting or by sculpture. Perfect beauty does not seek\r\nconcealment, but simply admits the world to share its joy, without\r\nemotion of vanity or shame, without regard to rank or dignity. Pauline\r\nBuonaparte Princess Borghese was the model for Canova’s Venus. Bernini\r\nmodelled his David (in Villa Borghese) from his own yυμνότης, while\r\nCardinal Barberini (afterwards the Lord Urban PP. VIII) held the mirror.\r\nThat amiable rake Messer Rafael Sanzio da Urbino painted his baker’s\r\ndaughter as Madonna. Messer Jacopo Sansovino sculptured his Dionusos\r\nfrom a lad called Lippo Fabri, who, from long posing bare, took cold and\r\ndied of fever; and, in his last delirium, continually leaped from his\r\nbed to pose as the god to whom his life was sacrificed. Messer\r\nMichelangelo Buonarroti, lost in admiration of his model the son of\r\nMesser Francesco Raibolini of Bologna (detto Il Francia), with his naif\r\nand customary depreciation of his brother-painters, told the boy that\r\nhis father made better men by night than by day. Messer Andrea\r\nVerrocchio did his slim lean David from one of his alert apprentices.\r\nMesser Luca Signorelli painted his own dead son. Messer Rafaele Sanzio\r\nhimself, times without number, sat for his master Il Pinturicchio. The\r\nbeautiful Simoneta of Florence was the Venus of Messer Alessandro\r\nFilipepi (detto Botticelli); and the sons of Lorenzo and Giuliano de’\r\nMedici (two of whom in after years wore the Triregno) did not disdain to\r\nsit as models for this master. All the works of art of the Borgian Era,\r\nrepresenting saints and sinners, gods and demigods, eudaimones and\r\nkakadaimones, all obviously were portraits; the very imperfections,\r\nwhich the century of the Discovery of Man was too eager and too\r\nunsophisticated to plane away to fit arbitrary conventions, shew this:\r\nand volumes might be written of the models of great masters, who let\r\ntheir youth or beauty be set down for all time, and then achieved fame\r\nas Rafaele did, or Messer Simone Fiorentini’s (detto Donatello) nitid\r\nDavid or superb Saint George, or Messer Andrea del Sarto’s wistful Young\r\nSaint John.\r\n\r\nWherefore, not only may it be admitted, but defended, that Madonna\r\nGiulia Orsini (nata Farnese), who had come to share with Madonna\r\nLucrezia Borgia the distinction of being the fairest young mother in\r\nRome, sat as model to Il Pinturicchio for the Θεοτόκος of the Borgia\r\nTower.\r\n\r\nBut, in proof of the ghastly ignorance or devilish malice which has\r\nsought to introduce an element of lubricity into this affair, it is\r\nnecessary that three important facts should not go unconsidered. They\r\nare\r\n\r\n  (α) that the Borgia Tower contained three or four large halls:\r\n\r\n  (β) that the portrait of Madonna Giulia Orsini (nata Farnese), detta\r\n        La Bella, in the character of the Blessed Virgin Mary with her\r\n        Child, is a round picture over the door of the third hall; She\r\n        is encircled by angels, and there are no other figures in the\r\n        composition:\r\n\r\n  (γ) that the portrait of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI is a square\r\n        picture in the second hall; and the Holiness of the Pope is\r\n        presented in His pontifical habits but bare-headed and without\r\n        the triregno, devoutly kneeling before the Apparition of our\r\n        Divine Redeemer Who rises from the tomb.\r\n\r\nThat is the little matter of the calumny, in support of which the German\r\nhistorian with others of like mind have solved the problem of the\r\nsquaring of the circle![43]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow that the French alliance was secure, with the help of the Christian\r\nKing Louis XII, the Lord Alexander P.P. VI proceeded with the conquest\r\nof the Romagna and the reduction of the rebellious vassals of the Holy\r\nSee. Duke Cesare de Valentinois was named Generalissimo of the\r\npontifical army; and a Papal Bull declared the fiefs of Rimini, Pesaro,\r\nImola, Forli, Camerino, Faenza, etc., to have forfeited their rights\r\nuntil they should have made satisfaction, paying the arrears of annual\r\ntribute into the chancery of their paramount lord. The fact was fully\r\nrealised that it was useless to attempt to pacify “these kakodaimones”\r\nwith “holy water”; as, as a last resort, after seven years forbearance,\r\nforce was to be used against Sforza of Pesaro, Sforza-Riario of Imola\r\nand Forli, Manfredi of Faenza and the rest. The glowing splendour of the\r\npersonality of Duke Cesare de Valentinois, without emotion and without\r\nremorse, fitted him for his task. He was a perfect egoist, splendidly\r\nindifferent to all the world. During his life, his enormous talents, his\r\nswift success, his summary acts gained him the reputation of being\r\nsuperhuman, inevitable as Fate. On the eleventh of November 1499, he\r\nleft Rome with four thousand condottieri and three hundred lancers. His\r\nlieutenant and standard-bearer was the same noble and vigorous knight,\r\nDon Pietro Gregorio Borgia, of the Veliternian Branch, who had changed\r\nclothes with him in 1495, enabling him to cheat the Christian King. On\r\nthe seventeenth of December, he stormed and captured Imola, whence\r\nMadonna Caterina Sforza, widow of Count Girolamo Riario, had fled,\r\nrefusing obedience or tribute to her suzerain, and anew entrenching\r\nherself at Forli, her other fief. She left at Imola such an odious\r\nmemory of her rule, that in after years the citizens would blush for\r\nshame of it, while blessing Duke Cesare de Valentinois, who, as the\r\nminister of Divine Justice, made an end.\r\n\r\nThe encounter between Madonna Caterina and Duke Cesare caused\r\nextraordinary exhibitions of vigour and agility on both sides. When a\r\ndesperate unscrupulous woman struggles with a strong and ruthless man,\r\nshe will do much damage: but, in the end, she must succumb. Directly\r\nafter the fall of Imola, Duke Cesare received letters from Rome\r\nannouncing that the Pope’s Holiness narrowly had escaped violent death:\r\nfor Madonna Caterina, to save herself and her fiefs, believing that Duke\r\nCesare would be compelled to relinquish his expedition if the Pope were\r\ndead, had tried to slay the Holy Father by means of venom. To this end,\r\nshe had sent two Orators charged with proposed conditions of peace; and\r\nalso she sent a letter (enclosed in a hollow stick, say some) which\r\nwould cause the Supreme Pontiff to fall dead as soon as He should open\r\nit. When the plot was discovered, Tommaso da Forli, a papal chamberlain\r\nwho had brought the missive, admitted his guilt; (under the Question\r\nguilt was commonly admitted); and said that he hoped, by the death of\r\nthe Pope, to raise the siege of Imola and Forli. This extraordinary\r\nstory is recorded by several chroniclers, including Monsignor Hans\r\nBurchard the Caerimonarius, the dull and stupid defamer of the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI. The name of the chamberlain gives rise to curious\r\nspeculations. Tommaso da Forli presumably might be a bastard of the city\r\nof Forli of insufficient birth to warrant the adoption of the\r\nappellation of his unknown father or mother; and who might very well\r\nhave taken the name of his native city with the preposition “da” (not\r\n“de’,” be it noted) as a surname. Papal chamberlains are nothing more\r\nthan pontifical flunkeys, and “Thomas from Forli,” being a lackey with\r\naccess to the Pontifical Person, might have been employed by Madonna\r\nCaterina to stab the Pope. That is not unlikely: but the story of the\r\nenvenomed letter obviously is false; and interesting only as shewing the\r\ntrend of men’s minds in 1499; and as a proof, perhaps, that if, as has\r\nbeen alleged in the purest ignorance, the envenoming of its foes was a\r\ncustom of the House of Borgia, at least one other Italian court indulged\r\nin the same horrible habit upon occasion.\r\n\r\nMadonna Caterina’s second recorded act of treachery took place after she\r\nhad surrendered the city of Forli to Duke Cesare. She retained\r\npossession of the castle, and refused to give it up. As soon as the\r\npontifical artillery began to bombard her fortress on Christmas Day, she\r\nflew, from one of the fortalices, a banner bearing the Lion of St. Mark,\r\nto make believe that she was leagued with Venice, a republic then at\r\npeace with the Holy See. It was a Venetian attached to the staff of Duke\r\nCesare who exposed the ruse, with the affirmation that his Senate had no\r\nalliance with Madonna Caterina. The day following, she gave signs of\r\nweakening; and requested a parley with her beleaguerer. When Duke Cesare\r\napproached, and just was about to put his foot on the drawbridge over\r\nthe moat by which the castle was surrounded, suddenly and without\r\nwarning the machine swung up and in. Madonna Caterina indignantly\r\ndisclaimed any perfidious intent, and threw all blame on the castellan,\r\nDon Giovanni Casale: but all beholders were aware of a deliberate\r\nattempt to capture and hideously to kill the Generalissimo, which only\r\nhad failed through too eager precipitancy. No parley took place; the\r\nsiege continued; and, in time, this audacious war-wife was compelled to\r\ncapitulate. Duke Cesare sent her to Rome as a prisoner-of-state, with\r\nevery chivalrous consideration for her sex as well as for her\r\nillustrious birth as daughter of the great Duke Francesco\r\nSforza-Visconti of Milan: and on her arrival in the City she was lodged\r\nin the Belvedere Apartment of the Vatican, whence, after a futile\r\nattempt at escape, she was transferred to honourable captivity in the\r\nMola of Hadrian.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege of Forli an event occurred, of secondary importance,\r\nexcept as evidence of the mystery surrounding the paternity of Duke\r\nCesare. The Most Worshipful Lord Giovanni Borgia (detto Giuniore)\r\nCardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Maria _in Via Lata_ died at\r\nUrbino. He was one of the bastards of that beautiful splendid sneak and\r\ncoward Don Pedro Luis de Lançol y Borgia, (Duke of Spoleto, younger\r\nbrother of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, who had been named Prefect of\r\nRome and Castellan of Santangelo by his Uncle, the Lord Calixtus P.P.\r\nIII, and who died in his flight from Rome in 1458). The said Most\r\nWorshipful Lord Cardinal Giovanni Giuniore had been Bishop of Melfi\r\nsince 1492. In 1496, he was elevated to the Sacred College, and given\r\ncommand of the condottieri which the Lord Alexander P.P. VI was\r\npreparing against France; and, when Duke Cesare renounced his scarlet\r\nearly in 1499, he had ceded to this cardinal his Metropolitan\r\nArchbishopric of Valencia. The Lord Giovanni Giuniore had held Legations\r\nto Umbria, Bologna, Ravenna and France, and was acting as Legate to\r\nUmbria when he died at Urbino. Duke Cesare himself announced this death\r\nto the Pope in a letter written from Forli, and dated the sixteenth of\r\nJanuary 1500, in these words: “I have news of the death of Cardinal\r\nBorgia, _my brother_, who died at Urbino.” Duke Cesare wrote a kind of\r\nLatin neither Golden nor Silvern but particular to himself, as also was\r\nhis Italian and there is no known instance of his using “frater” or\r\n“fratello” in the tertiary sense of “cousin.” If the dead Cardinal and\r\nthe Duke were uterine brothers, then Don Pedro Luis was their father;\r\nand Duke Cesare was not the son, but the nephew, of the Lord Alexander\r\nP.P. VI. The death of the Cardinal, however, has been alleged by some\r\nchroniclers to have been caused by venom administered by Duke Cesare.\r\nThe charge is essentially absurd. There was no motive; for Cardinal and\r\nDuke were comrades, _brothers-in-arms_, equally engaged in the reduction\r\nof the rebellious Romagna; there could have been no jealousy, for they\r\noccupied separate and independent ranks, (of which Duke Cesare had\r\nchosen his,) the Cardinal Giovanni Giuniore as Legate, being the older\r\nman (41), and Duke Cesare the younger (26) as Generalissimo: nor was the\r\nCardinal rich enough to make his death desirable. But, at all events, it\r\nwas impossible that Duke Cesare should envenom him for the simple\r\nreasons that the two were many miles apart during seventeen days before\r\nthe death, and that no venom of slow action was known to the Fifteenth\r\nCentury any more than it is to the Twentieth.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the Seventh Consistory of the sixteenth (or twentieth) of March 1500,\r\nthe Lord Alexander P.P. VI named three cardinals, who were\r\n\r\n  (α) the Lord Don Didaco Hurtado de Mendoza, a Spaniard;\r\n        Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Sabina: (he was\r\n        afterwards called “The Cardinal of Spain:”)\r\n\r\n  (β) the Lord Amaneus (Amanateus) d’Albret, of Navarre; Cardinal-Deacon\r\n        of San Niccolo _in Carcere Tulliano_:\r\n\r\n  (γ) the Lord Don Pedro Luis de Borja, a Pontifical Nephew, brother of\r\n        the Cardinal of Monreale (Giovanni Seniore); succeeded his\r\n        deceased cousin Cardinal Giovanni Giuniore as Cardinal-Deacon of\r\n        Santa Maria in _Via Lata_.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Christian King Louis XII, now calling himself the “Second Caesar,”\r\nwas not idle during this year 1500. Duke Ludovico Maria Sforza-Visconti\r\ncertainly recovered his duchy of Milan; but, after the Triumph given to\r\nDuke Cesare de Valentinois in Rome on his return from the Romagna with\r\nMadonna Caterina Sforza-Riario as his prisoner-of-war, the prestige of\r\nthe Papacy was so increased that the French took heart and gained a\r\nnotable victory at Novara, capturing Duke Ludovico Maria and his brother\r\nthe Vicechancellor, who then were incarcerated safely in France.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn July, Don Alonso de Aragona, Prince of Bisceglia, Quadrata, and\r\nSalerno, and husband of Madonna Lucrezia Borgia was murdered; and the\r\nopinion carefully and carelessly has been cultivated that this was one\r\nof the crimes of Duke Cesare de Valentinois and the Lord Alexander P.P.\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nAccording to the account of Don Paolo Cappello the Orator of Venice, as\r\ngiven by Herr Gregorovius, Prince Don Alonso, going to the Vatican at\r\neleven o’clock at night on the fifteenth of July, was assaulted on the\r\nsteps of St. Peter’s by masked men armed with poignards, and wounded in\r\nthe head and arms and thighs. Weak from loss of blood, he dragged\r\nhimself into the Apostolic Palace, where his wife Madonna Lucrezia\r\nswooned at the sight of him. He was carried into one of the rooms; and a\r\ncardinal, believing him to be in the article of death, imparted the\r\nusual absolution. But his youthful vigour enabled him to progress on the\r\nroad to recovery, under the nursing of his wife and of his sister-in-law\r\nMadonna Sancia, who, with their own hands, prepared his food (they were\r\nroyal princesses), while the Pope’s Holiness provided a body-guard of\r\nmen-at-arms. No one knew who had wounded the prince: but gossip said\r\nthat it was the same hand that had slain the Duke of Gaudia. Duke Cesare\r\nde Valentinois had issued an edict forbidding any one bearing arms to\r\npass between the Mola of Hadrian and the Vatican. Don Paolo Cappello\r\nfurther records that Duke Cesare had said, “I did not wound the prince:\r\nbut, if I had “done so, he had well deserved it.” Duke Cesare was not\r\nashamed to visit the invalid; and, in coming away, he had said, “That,\r\nwhich is not done at noon, can be done at sunset.” More than a month\r\nlater, at nine o’clock on the night of the eighteenth of August, Duke\r\nCesare again visited Prince Don Alonso; and, having driven Madonna\r\nSancia and Madonna Lucrezia from the room, he introduced his captain Don\r\nMichelotto who strangled the wounded man. After this, Duke Cesare\r\npublicly declared that he had killed the Prince of Bisceglia, because\r\nthe latter had tried to murder him by setting an archer to shoot him\r\nsilently in the Vatican gardens:—so far Don Paolo Cappello.\r\n\r\nMonsignor Hans Burchard the Caerimonarius says, that, at eleven o’clock\r\non the night of the fifteenth of July, Prince Don Alonso the husband of\r\nMadonna Lucrezia Borgia was found on the steps of St. Peter’s, wounded\r\nby assassins in the head, the knee, and the right arm. After the\r\nassault, the assassins were escorted by forty knights beyond the\r\nCity-gate called Porta Pertusa. Prince Don Alonso lived near the Vatican\r\nin the palace of the Cardinal of Santa Maria _in Portico_; but, owing to\r\nthe serious nature of his wounds, he was carried into the pontifical\r\npalace, and lodged in a room of the Borgia Tower. When King Don Federigo\r\nheard of the attempt upon his nephew, he sent Messer Galieno his own\r\nleech to cure him. Later the prince was strangled; and the leeches with\r\na certain hunchback servant were put to the Question in the Mola of\r\nHadrian, and afterwards released as innocent.\r\n\r\nA chronicle of Pavia of much later date says that Duke Cesare killed\r\nPrince Don Alonso at a time when he was in bed with his own wife Madonna\r\nLucrezia.\r\n\r\nBefore examining the divergences of this evidence, it may as well be\r\nsaid that the original despatches of Don Paolo Cappello the Orator of\r\nVenice are not attainable. Many years later, a learned patrician of\r\nVenice, Don Marino Sanuto, wrote the History of the Venetian Republic\r\nfrom 1496 to 1533 in fifty-six folio volumes. He cited the\r\nstate-archives, despatches of orators, etc., and his work is\r\nmarvellously well done: but when all is said, the fact remains that the\r\ndespatches of Don Paolo Cappello, with those of many others, have been\r\nedited by a stranger to the writers, and to the circumstances under\r\nwhich they wrote. Monsignor Burchard held an important office at the\r\nVatican. He was German, and inimical to Borgia. On matters connected\r\nwith his office of Caerimonarius, _i.e._, the superintendence of public\r\nfunctions, he might speak with some authority: but beyond that he is an\r\ninveterate gossip and scandalmonger. In his case, also, it is impossible\r\nto know what he really wrote, because the original holograph of his\r\nDiarium (with the Diarium of Infessura and other similar works) even now\r\nawaits discovery by students of ancient archives.\r\n\r\nWhat charges lie against Duke Cesare de Valentinois? It is Cappello who\r\nstates that he drove away the women, and caused Prince Don Alonso to be\r\nstrangled by Don Michelotto. Burchard appears ignorant of these details.\r\nIt is Cappello who states that Duke Cesare admitted and defended the\r\nmurder. Of this Burchard says nothing: he relates that the prince was\r\nstrangled; and, from his mention of the interrogation of the leeches and\r\nof the hunchback, it would appear that others beside Duke Cesare were\r\nsuspected. Cappello says that the prince was poignarded in head, arms,\r\nand thighs; Burchard, in head, right arm, and knee. Cappello speaks of a\r\nguard appointed by the Pope to watch the wounded man. Burchard does not\r\nrecord this. There are discrepancies between the two accounts; some, of\r\nreasonable importance: _e.g._, Burchard’s account of the forty knights\r\nwho escorted the assassins from the City; and of the sending of the\r\nroyal leech without mentioning any suspicions on the part of King Don\r\nFederigo. But nowhere can be found a proved accusation against Duke\r\nCesare de Valentinois, or against the Holiness of the Pope.\r\n\r\nFrom a study of the various statements, (derisable though to some extent\r\nthey be,) and of known facts, a reasonable enough history of the affair\r\nmay be compiled, and one which happens to be exculpatory of Borgia.\r\n\r\nDon Alonso de Aragona Prince of Bisceglia, Salerno, etc., was a nephew\r\nof King Don Federigo of Naples. At the age of nineteen, he married\r\nMadonna Lucrezia Borgia, on political grounds to consolidate friendly\r\nrelations then existing between Papacy and Regno. All accounts agree\r\nthat this was a genuine love-match as well; and the chronicler Talini\r\nsays of the prince, “he was the most beautiful youth that I have ever\r\nseen in Rome.”\r\n\r\nA year after the marriage Madonna Lucrezia bore him an heir, Don\r\nRoderico; who immediately was provided-for with the duchy of Sermoneta.\r\nThe young Prince and Princess of Bisceglia lived in the palace of the\r\nCardinal of Sante Maria _in Portico_ by the Vatican, in order to be near\r\nto the Pope.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1500, the relations of Papacy and Regno had undergone a\r\nchange. The Lord Alexander P.P. VI was now allied with France, the old\r\nand still-distrusted enemy of Naples; and King Don Federigo had joined\r\nthe unmitigable handful of men who were blackmailing the Pope’s Holiness\r\nwith threats of a General Council. The Prince of Bisceglia as a\r\nNeapolitan, therefore, would not be persona gratissima to the supporters\r\nof Borgia.\r\n\r\nWhen it was desired to reward and exalt a subject, the sovereigns of the\r\nBorgian Era had the naïve habit of dispossessing one of their enemies,\r\nand conferring the vacated fief on their new protégé. In order to enrich\r\nPrince Don Alonso with the principality of Salerno, the Majesty of\r\nNaples had deprived the noble Neapolitan House of Sanseverini. In order\r\nto enrich His grandson the baby Don Roderico with the duchy of\r\nSermoneta, the Holiness of the Pope had despoiled the noble Roman House\r\nof Caïetani. And it readily will be understood that Caïetani and\r\nSanseverini were extremely likely to view these losses with anything but\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\nRegarding the edict of Duke Cesare de Valentinois, that none should go\r\narmed between the Mola and the Vatican, it must be admitted that this\r\nwas only a very ordinary precautionary measure. The district named is\r\nthe immediate precincts of the pontifical palaces of peace and war,\r\nwhich were connected by the fortified gallery-passage, through the\r\nRegion of Borgo, called Lo Andare; and the baring of arms within the\r\npresence of royalty was, at all times, and in all courts, a capital\r\ncrime. Duke Cesare as Generalissimo was responsible for the maintenance\r\nof order; and he was no laggard in any official capacity. If then, the\r\ntruth of the stabbing on the steps of St. Peter’s and the strangulation\r\nin the Borgia Tower be granted, they might be defended as an execution\r\nof the death penalty prescribed for a breach of the law, such as the\r\nfiery Neapolitan prince is extremely likely to have committed. Royal or\r\npatrician criminals were frequently done to death in private, by\r\nquasi-assassination, to avoid the degradation of the touch of the public\r\ncarnifex.\r\n\r\nAgain, granting the said stabbing and strangling, and regarding them as\r\nan act of private vengeance on the part of Duke Cesare against the\r\nprince; it should be remembered that people had the custom of defending\r\ntheir lives by slaughtering an enemy who set archers to shoot at them in\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\nBut, during the pontificate of the Lord Julius P.P. II (Giuliano della\r\nRovere) the eternal enemy of the House of Borgia, (whose not mean\r\nportrait by Messer Rafaele Sanzio da Urbino may be seen at the National\r\nGallery,) the captain Don Michelotto, who is supposed to have strangled\r\nthe Prince of Bisceglia by order of Duke Cesare, was seized and put to\r\nthe Question in the usual manner. It was attempted to find out, by means\r\nof this rigour, the truth about the various crimes which he was said to\r\nhave committed for his master; and particularly the murder of Prince Don\r\nAlonso. But although he was in the hands of a ruthless despot, who,\r\nlegally could have broiled him alive like a forger or could have broken\r\nwith iron bars every bone of every limb of his body on the Wheel, with\r\nnone to hinder, Don Michelotto soon was set at liberty as having given\r\nno evidence of guilt, either on his own part or of that of Duke Cesare.\r\nIt will appear from this fairly convincing test that there is a strong\r\nreason for regarding the story of strangulation as a piece of fiction.\r\nAs a last contribution to the theory, it is suggested that contortions\r\ncaused by _tetanus_, which might have set in by reason of the poignard\r\nwounds, may have simulated, to the ignorant and casual observer, the\r\nappearance of strangulation. The bacillus of tetanus is of earth origin,\r\nand every one knows the vulgar method of wiping a dagger. Otherwise the\r\nstrangulation theory may be dismissed.\r\n\r\nOf the stabbing on the steps of St. Peter’s there is no such room for\r\ndoubt. The discrepancy between Cappello (edited by Sanuto, understood,)\r\nand Burchard, (a copy of him by an unknown hand, also understood,) as to\r\nthe position of the wounds has no material significance. Head, arms, and\r\nthighs, says Cappello; head, right arm, and knee, says Burchard. It is\r\nquite clear that the unfortunate youth (he was just of the age of\r\ntwenty-one years) wore beneath his doublet one of the fashionable\r\nmail-shirts of the day, strong enough to turn a tempered blade at\r\nclosest quarters and yet so fine that it could be hidden in two hands;\r\nand which caused him to be wounded anywhere except in his handsome\r\ntrunk.\r\n\r\nThe number of wounds and their wide distribution speak of more than one\r\noccasion. The frightful loss of blood (the wound in the thigh), the\r\ndelusions of Fifteenth Century chirurgeons, the elementary condition of\r\nthe pharmacopœia, the time of year—Sol in Leone—when Rome fizzles in\r\nfevers and insanitary stenches, preclude possibility of recovery: and it\r\nis only reasonable to conceive that Prince Don Alonso died, after a\r\nmonth’s lingering weakness and fever, of the poignard wounds and the\r\nattentions of the leeches, unassisted by a problematic noose, or the\r\ncompression of his windpipe by strong thumbs.\r\n\r\nThen who were the masked men with poignards, and who is responsible for\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nIn this connection, Duke Cesare de Valentinois has not been named. The\r\nPope’s Holiness did not alter His behaviour to him. He found him\r\nantipathetic as always: some said He was afraid of him.[44] But He did\r\nnot cease to use him, to allow him access to His person, to decorate him\r\nwith titles; and the Lord Alexander P.P. VI was far too magnificently\r\ninvincible and too conscious of His power, not to have resented the\r\nmurder of the beloved husband of His charming and favourite daughter. A\r\nPontiff Who could, and did, crush reigning sovereigns at His will, was\r\nnot likely to fear a mere duke. The clergy treated Duke Cesare, as\r\nalways, with profound respect. And—Madonna Lucrezia Borgia, until the\r\nvery end of his life, maintained friendly relations with him; and it was\r\nto her that the death of the Prince of Bisceglia brought most grievous\r\ntrouble. Evidently the people most intimately concerned with Duke Cesare\r\ndid not look upon him as an assassin: at any rate, the legend of his\r\nguilt subsequently emanated, not from them but, from his foes.\r\n\r\nThere was a total absence of motive on the part of Duke Cesare, unless\r\nthe theory of legal but private execution, or the theory of justifiable\r\nhomicide, be maintained. And for want of proof of strangulation, these\r\ncan be dismissed with deserved contempt.\r\n\r\nBut—there was a very strong motive for the stabbing present in the\r\nNeapolitan House of Sanseverini, and in the Roman House of Caïetani, who\r\nhad suffered loss of the principality of Salerno, and of the duchy of\r\nSermoneta, in order to the enrichment of Prince Don Alonso of Bisceglia\r\nand Salerno and his infant son Duke Roderico of Sermoneta. Is it\r\nprobable that great barons of the Fifteenth Century, or of any other\r\ncentury, calmly would submit to deprivation of their choicest fiefs,\r\nwithout at least an attempt to gain satisfaction of one or another kind?\r\nIt may be concluded, then, that in all human probability Prince Don\r\nAlonso was the victim of a vendetta. His assassination was a private\r\naffair. The assassins were professionals in the pay of Sanseverini, or\r\nCaïetani, or both together; who, when the deed apparently was done,\r\n(here Burchard recording probability is valuable,) were surrounded by\r\nforty knights (Sanseverini or Caïetani of course) and escorted out of\r\nthe City by the nearest gate, Porta Pertusa behind St. Peter’s, (the\r\nnearest gate to avoid attracting the attention of the bargelli in Borgo\r\nor Trastevere), whence, by a short circuit to the south, they would\r\nattain the Via Portuense, sixteen miles of which would bring them to\r\nPorto on the right bank of Tiber, opposite to the fortress at Ostia on\r\nthe left bank belonging to Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the Eighth Consistory of the twenty-eighth of September 1500, the\r\nLord Alexander P.P. VI named ten cardinals, who were,\r\n\r\n  (α) the Lord Don Jaime Serra, a Catalan, Vicegerent of Rome;\r\n        Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San Vitale:\r\n\r\n  (β) the Lord ... Bacocz, an Hungarian, Chancellor of Hungary;\r\n        Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San Martino _ai Monti_:\r\n\r\n  (γ) the Lord Don Pedro Isualles, a Sicilian; Cardinal-Presbyter of the\r\n        Title of San Ciriaco _alle Terme Diocleziane_:\r\n\r\n  (δ) the Lord Don Francisco de Borja, bastard of the Lord Calixtus P.P.\r\n        III; who had lived obscurely from his birth in 1441 until now;\r\n        Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Lucia _in Silice_ alias\r\n        _in Orfea_:\r\n\r\n  (ε) the Lord Don Juan Vera, a Spaniard, Archbishop of Saliterno;\r\n        Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Balbina:\r\n\r\n  (ζ) the Lord Alois Podachatarios, a noble of Cyprus, the Pontifical\r\n        Greek Secretary; Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Sant’ Agata\r\n        _in Suburra_:\r\n\r\n  (η) the Lord Giovantonio Trivulzio, a noble of Milan, elevated to\r\n        oblige the Christian King Louis XII; Cardinal-Presbyter of the\r\n        Title of Santa Anastasia:\r\n\r\n  (θ) the Lord Giambattista Ferrari, Bishop of Modena;\r\n        Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San Crisogono:\r\n\r\n  (κ) the Lord Gianstefano Ferreri, Abbot of San Stefano di Vercello;\r\n        Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San Sergio e San Bacco:\r\n\r\n  (ι) the Lord Marco Cornaro, brother of Madonna Caterina Cornaro, Queen\r\n        of Cyprus; Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria _in Portico_.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn view of the danger looming in the near East, the Lord Alexander P.P.\r\nVI issued a Bull proclaiming a new Crusade; and addressed a Brief in the\r\nsame sense to the Christian King Louis XII. Venice being in serious and\r\nimmediate peril received His help in the shape of money and troops.\r\nNevertheless though Modon fell to the Muslim Infidel, even this\r\ndisaster, giving point to the Pope’s exordium, failed to arouse the\r\nChristian Princes of Europe from their disgraceful apathy. The Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI now imposed a graduated crusade tax on the revenues of\r\nthe Sacred College, each cardinal being mulcted on the value of his\r\nbenefices. This, though a righteous and elevating ensample, was looked\r\nupon with extreme disgust; for, like other men, cardinals are very\r\nsensitive in the pouch. Cardinal Raymond Perauld, forgiven for his\r\ntreachery with Charles VIII, was named Apostolic Ablegate to Germany\r\ncharged with authority to reform the abuses, which avarice and ambition\r\non the part of German prelates were causing, to the shame of all\r\nright-minded men. But the Elect-Emperor Maximilian—(who, in a picture by\r\nAlbrecht Durer in the British Museum, modestly is styled _Imperator\r\nCaesar Divus Maximilianus Pius Felix Augustus_;[45] and, in another, on\r\nvellum in the same collection, bears, after the imperial titles, the\r\nstyles of all sovereigns of Europe, including _Rex Angliæ_, in despite\r\nof King Henry VII Tudor then happily reigning,)—the Elect-Emperor\r\nMaximilian remembered that in 1496 his ill-advised advance into Venetia\r\nhad been opposed and not received with obsequious adulation; and he now\r\nrefused to allow the Papal Ablegate to enter his Empire. In such\r\npettiness did the Holy Roman Emperor of the Habsburg House of Austria\r\nhave continual joy.\r\n\r\nThis year in Rome was the Holy Year, the last of the Fifteenth Century,\r\nthe year of Jubilee. The Holy Father extended the privilege to\r\nChristendom; and huge pilgrimages of persons of rank and distinction\r\nfrom all Christian countries save Germany and Switzerland flocked to the\r\nEternal City throughout the year. The pilgrims’ alms considerably added\r\nto the papal treasury; and, by order of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI,\r\nthese exclusively were set aside for the pacification of the States of\r\nthe Church in the Romagna; a magnificent example of the political\r\nforesight which secured the temporal possessions of the Holy See during\r\nthree hundred and seventy years, till 1870. Before the end of the year\r\n1500 the splendour of Duke Cesare de Valentinois was increased by the\r\ntitle of Gonfaloniere of the Holy Roman Church: and, with the ample\r\nfunds of the Jubilee, he had enlarged his army by the acquisition of\r\nseveral squadrons of French mercenaries, for a new expedition into the\r\nrebellious provinces.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of the Sixteenth Century, A.D. 1501, the Apostolic\r\nAblegate Cardinal Raymond Perauld came to an agreement with the Diet at\r\nNürnberg: and the project of a Crusade was improved by the formation of\r\na new league of the Papacy with Venice and Hungary, (the two countries\r\nwhich lay at the mercy of the Muslim Infidel;) and by some naval\r\nsuccesses with the conquest of Santa Maura by Bishop Giacopo da Pesaro.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the spring, Duke Cesare marched his reinforced army to beleaguer\r\nFaenza. There, the citizens had constructed a bastion during the winter\r\nat the convent of the Friars Minor-of-the-Observance outside the walls.\r\nOn the twelfth of April, this defence was taken by Duke Cesare, who\r\ninstalled a park of artillery to breach the citadel. The brave Faenzesi\r\nmade sorties from their city for grain and cattle: but the effect of\r\nfamine soon began to tell. (This account of the siege is Canon\r\nSebastiano di Zaccaria’s.) The rich shared their bread and wine with the\r\npoor. When money for paying the soldiers failed, the priests and monks\r\ngave the sacred vessels. Women took part in the defence, throwing stones\r\nfrom the walls, or strengthening the gabions with earthworks; while the\r\nmost daring fought, with casque and pike and harquebus, when their men\r\nslept. Matrons prayed in the churches. Barefooted boys and girls ran\r\nabout the streets praying for Divine Assistance for their fathers on the\r\nramparts. On the eighteenth of April, the sixth day of siege, the\r\nassault was made. Duke Cesare had advised the neighbouring princes; and\r\nDon Alfonso d’Este, heir of Ferrara, with his heraklean brother the\r\nathletic young Cardinal Ippolito were come post-haste to see the sight.\r\n(It is worth noting that advantage was taken of this visit to plan a\r\nmarriage between the young widow Madonna Lucrezia Borgia and Don Alfonso\r\nd’Este.) The assault lasted from one o’clock in the afternoon till four.\r\nThe assailants severely suffered from harquebuses, and flaming darts,\r\nand showers of stones, with which the beleaguered greeted them,\r\nintrepidly fighting on the smoking débris of their walls. Nothing was\r\nseen to equal Faenza’s valour: but Duke Cesare’s condottieri also gave\r\nsignal proof of bravery. Don Taddeo della Volpe of Imola, on being\r\nstruck in the eye by an arrow, tore it out and went on fighting, saying\r\nthat he was fortunate enough to see but half the danger now. Duke Cesare\r\nconceived so great an admiration for the courage of his enemies, as to\r\nsay that, with an army of Faenzesi, he cheerfully would undertake the\r\nconquest of all Italy. During seven hours on the twenty-first of April,\r\nartillery bombarded the citadel, which now was little more than a heap\r\nof ruins. Every night, some of the beleaguered slid over the walls, and\r\nescaped into the camp of Duke Cesare, worn by famine and the fatigue of\r\nthe siege. On the night of the twenty-second, one Bartolomeo Grammante,\r\na dyer, fled from a fortalice where he was on guard and came to the\r\nDuke, saying that there was mutiny in Faenza, that ammunition was\r\nexhausted, and offering to point out a moment favourable for assault.\r\nIncontinently Duke Cesare hanged this traitorous felon near the\r\ncity-wall, out of respect for the brave Faenzesi and their admirable\r\nresistance. Three days later, the end came. The conqueror offered most\r\nhonourable terms: complete liberty for the Tyrant Don Astorgio Manfredi,\r\nand his relations, to go and come at will; the integrity of his property\r\nand payment of his debts; confirmation of all rights and privileges for\r\nthe citizens.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-sixth of April, the municipal officers came to the convent\r\nof the Observantines where Duke Cesare lodged; and swore between his\r\nhands the feudal oath of fidelity to the over-lord, the Holiness of the\r\nPope. At three o’clock in the afternoon, came also Don Astorgio Manfredi\r\nwith his kin. This unfortunate youth was only of the age of sixteen\r\nyears, the servant of his own subjects, and an orphan whose father, Don\r\nGaleotto Manfredi, had been murdered by his mother, Madonna Francesca\r\nBentivogli. A Venetian chronicler says of him that he was “a sickly lad\r\n(_puto mal san_) but beautiful fair and rosy,” obviously rotten with\r\nstruma; and as such he appears in his portrait in the Palazzo\r\nZauli-Naldi of Faenza, wearing an expression of profound melancholy. The\r\nyoung Tyrant and his bastard brother, Don Gianevangelista Manfredi, (who\r\nwas of the age of fourteen years, and had had a command during the\r\nsiege,) received so courteous a reception from Duke Cesare that they\r\ndecided to remain with him. So far, the behaviour of the Generalissimo\r\nappears to have been inspired by noble magnanimity.\r\n\r\nAnd here, there is a lacuna. The history of Don Astorgio becomes blank.\r\nResearch so far has failed to discover any trace of him for months.\r\n\r\nSome time after his capitulation, Don Astorgio and his brother were\r\nfound incarcerated in the Mola of Hadrian, in the royal apartment which\r\nMadonna Caterina Sforza-Riario had vacated on going into exile in\r\nFrance: and of this, also, there has been no explanation yet discovered.\r\n\r\nIt is permissible to suppose that after Duke Cesare generously had\r\ngranted their unconditional liberty, some imperious political necessity\r\nintervened; such as that Don Astorgio and Don Gianevangelista, held as\r\nhostages, would guarantee the tranquillity of Faenza, preventing further\r\nrebellion. Duke Cesare’s apparent breach of faith is not without its\r\nparallels in ancient, modern, and contemporary history; a political\r\ncrime, perhaps necessary, but for which there is neither extenuation nor\r\nexcuse.\r\n\r\nBut later still, the story ends in tragedy. The two boys are said to\r\nhave been killed, and their bodies cast in Tiber. The only two\r\nchronicles which have the slightest value are those of Don Antonio\r\nGiustiniani the Orator of Venice, who was in Rome; and of Monsignor Hans\r\nBurchard the Papal Caerimonarius, who might have been there: though the\r\noriginals of these chronicles, be it remembered, are yet to seek.\r\n\r\nThe former wrote to his government,\r\n\r\n  “_They say_ that this night those two young lords of Faenza with their\r\n  steward have been slain and thrown in Tiber.”\r\n\r\nThe latter records in his journal,\r\n\r\n  “There were found in Tiber, suffocated and dead, the lord of Faenza, a\r\n  youth of about the age of eighteen years, beautiful and well-shaped,\r\n  with a stone at his neck; and two youths bound together by the arms,\r\n  the one of fifteen and the other of twenty-five years; and near them a\r\n  certain woman, and several others.”\r\n\r\nIt is said also that the victims were floating in Tiber in the sight of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe affair is the occasion of another of the calumnies which have been\r\ncast upon the House of Borgia. Not one word is said by contemporaries\r\nimplicating Borgia in this crime: yet the modern fiction-monger or\r\nquoad-historian who without hesitation did not place it to Borgia’s\r\ndebit would consider himself guilty of dereliction of duty.\r\n\r\nThe statements of the Venetian and the German, quoted above, will not\r\nbear examination in the light of common sense. A rational and\r\nunprejudiced observer will have noticed that Giustiniani does not speak\r\nof having seen with his own eyes. He is not imparting official\r\ninformation: he reports a mere _on dit_. But Burchard’s account is a\r\nmiracle of Teutonic completeness at all costs, and lack of sense of the\r\nridiculous. He does not say that he has seen the show. He gives no\r\nauthority for his statements. But he adds, to Don Astorgio and Don\r\nGianevangelista, a youth of twenty-five, a certain woman, and several\r\nothers! Is any reliance to be placed on Burchard, uncorroborated and\r\nunashamed? He says that the corpse of Don Astorgio had a stone at his\r\nneck, yet he was floating on Tiber in the sight of all! How can a\r\ncadaver float when weighted with a stone? The density of Tiber is not\r\nlike that of the Dead Sea or Droitwich Brine Baths. Also, Tiber\r\nnotoriously is a swift current, far too turbid to permit a crowd of\r\ncorpses placidly to float in the sight of all. Also, Tiber exclusively\r\nwas used for drinking and household purposes, and constantly by all\r\nRomans, high and low, for swimming: the heraklean Lord Cardinal Prince\r\nIppolito d’Este swam there. Also, the Borgia were pre-eminently\r\nclever—cunning, their calumniators say. Then, is it probable that men of\r\nany common sense would offer a hecatomb of assassinations to Tiber, and\r\nto the sight of all, weighted only by Burchard’s single stone? Finally,\r\nhow is it that in the history of Faenza, and of the relations of these\r\nyoung lords, there is not a single allusion to the manner of their\r\ndeath? The learned Padre Leonetti justly contends that the story of the\r\nmurder is a mere fabrication; that the scribes, with Burchard and\r\nGiustiniani, have seen no floating bodies; but that they have contented\r\nthemselves, according to their custom, with fresh vilifications of the\r\nLord Alexander P.P. VI and of Duke Cesare de Valentinois.\r\n\r\nLet it be remembered that Don Astorgio Manfredi was “un puto mal san,” a\r\nsickly or strumous lad. Let it be remembered how extremely easy it is to\r\nkill strong boys off, between their fourteenth and their eighteenth\r\nyear, simply by depriving them of hope and joy. Let the most pathetic\r\nhistory of Don Astorgio Manfredi, of which the barest briefest extract\r\nhas been given, let his situation, and that of his young brother Don\r\nGianevangelista, be realized with care; and the humanly natural\r\nsupposition will arise, that these two died natural deaths due to\r\nconstitutional defects aggravated by hopeless imprisonment in the Mola\r\nof Hadrian.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard, however, if the enemies of Borgia could find nothing\r\nworse to say; and the abominable Messer Francesco Guicciardini of\r\nFlorence, pandar of France, minion of Ghibelline Colonna, does not fail\r\nto make use of that curiously common and invariably inconsequent calumny\r\nwhich mediocrity, in all ages, hurls at genius. He writes, “Astorgio was\r\nnot deprived of life before having first been used, _they say_, to\r\nsatiate the passions of a certain person.” Under the pen of historians\r\nwho followed Guicciardini, this “certain person” quite naturally has\r\nbecome the Lord Alexander P.P. VI. It is on the authority of this\r\nGuicciardini that writers, far from the scene, and long after the deed,\r\nhave allowed them to assail an old man, a priest, the Head of the\r\nChurch, with a shameful and execrable accusation. Did Guicciardini make\r\nthe very difficult examinations of this problematic corpse which\r\nmedical-law ordains? He was inspired, and very badly, by his hatred. He\r\nhas not proved the crimes of the Pope. He has only exhibited the\r\nfertility of a monstrously unclean and salacious imagination, the\r\ndévergondage of a mind stuffed with reminiscences of Tiberius, of Nero,\r\nof Elagabalus! (_Réné, Comte de Maricourt._)\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Lord Alexander P.P. VI had now reached the summit of His magnificent\r\npontificate. With the States of the Church slowly but surely being\r\nbrought under domination by the splendid gains of Duke Cesare de\r\nValentinois, with the interested support of the Christian King of France\r\nand the Catholic King of Spain, (for the latter had the sense to cease\r\nfrom annoying a powerful pontiff), and with His neighbour the Regno\r\nunder its weak King Don Federigo of no importance, there was nothing\r\nthat He might not do for the enrichment of the Papacy or the\r\naggrandisement of the House of Borgia. His policy was beginning to take\r\nshape. The enormous and magnificent project, which appears to have\r\ndictated all His actions, was assuming a concrete form. Difficulties of\r\nevery kind had beset Him from the beginning; and difficulties, He\r\ndoubtless knew, would be His constant portion: but by patience, agility\r\nof mind, diplomatic skill, singleness of purpose, and His invincible\r\nindomitable will, He had beaten down His opponents one by one, or had\r\nturned their opposition into support which now enabled Him to act\r\nindependently and upon His own initiative.\r\n\r\nHe made short work with the rebellious barons of Rome. He blasted Don\r\nPierfrancesco Colonna with excommunication. He confiscated the fiefs of\r\nthe Houses of Colonna and Savelli, both of the Ghibelline faction, who\r\nhad defied Him by secession to Charles VIII and the unmitigable Cardinal\r\nGiuliano della Rovere in 1494. He distributed the titles and estates so\r\nacquired among members of the House of Borgia.\r\n\r\nOn the first of September 1501, He issued a Brief legitimating that\r\nbastard of Duke Cesare de Valentinois and a Roman spinster, who had been\r\nborn in 1498, and was known as Infans Romanus; to whom He gave the name\r\nGiovanni, after His favourite son the murdered Duke of Gandia, as well\r\nas the duchy of Nepi. But, by a second Brief of the same date (in the\r\nArchives of Modena) He declares this Don Giovanni Borgia to be the son\r\n_not of the aforesaid Duke (Cesare) but of_ US _and the said\r\nspinster_.[46]\r\n\r\nThere exists no explanation of the contradiction in these two Briefs. It\r\nis, however, certain that no human temptation could induce a Pope to\r\npublish such a statement as that of the second, unless the thing were\r\ntrue; and, in the case of a Pope as powerful as the Lord Alexander P.P.\r\nVI, there was no superior power which could force Him against His will.\r\nAs to one of the Briefs being truth and the other falsehood, it may be\r\nremembered that there is a general law, a Necessary Proposition, “The\r\nlesser is contained in the greater.” The thing was true. The Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI, at the age of sixty-seven years, was the father of\r\nDon Giovanni Borgia, whom He created Duke of Nepi in 1501.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Alexander P.P. VI was a very great man; guilty of hiding none\r\nof his human weakness: and on this account a Terror to hypocrites of all\r\nensuing ages. Nothing in the world is so unpleasant, so disconcerting,\r\nso utterly abhorred, as the plain and naked truth.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the spoliation of the Houses of Colonna and Savelli—an act which\r\nreduced them from that of premier barons of the Holy See to a position\r\nof such insignificance that they no more appear in the history of this\r\npontificate,—the Pope’s Holiness married Madonna Lucrezia Borgia to Don\r\nAlfonso d’Este, the heir of Duke Ercole of Ferrara. This was after her\r\nyear of widowhood. She was now the wife of royalty, with a near prospect\r\nof a throne, worshipped by the poor for her boundless and sympathetic\r\ncharity, by the learned for her intelligence, by her kin for her loving\r\nloyalty, by her husband for her perfect wifehood and motherhood, by all\r\nfor her transcendent beauty and her spotless name. Why it has pleased\r\nmodern writers and painters to depict this pearl among women as a\r\n“poison-bearing maenad” a “veneficous bacchante” stained with revolting\r\nand unnatural turpitude, is one of those riddles to which there is no\r\nkey. If physiognomy be an index to character, the most superficial\r\ninspection of the effigy of Madonna Lucrezia Borgia must put her\r\ncalumniators to endless shame. In that simple profile, of features\r\nclean-cut, delicate, refined; in those chaste contours so gently\r\nrounded, so sweetly fresh and feminine; in the carriage of that flavian\r\nhead well-poised and nobly frank, there can lurk no taint of decadent\r\ndegeneracy. In the Ambrosian Library at Milan, is a long tress of her\r\nbeautiful yellow hair, shining and pale; with her scholarly letters to a\r\nlearned poet and cardinal the Lord Pietro Bembo, who had dedicated to\r\nher a genial Dialogue on platonics in Italian; an Elegy in Latin, in\r\npraise of her singing and recitation,\r\n\r\n         “_quicquid agis, quicquid loqueris, delectat: et omnes\r\n         “praecedunt Charites, subsequiturque decor_;\r\n\r\nwith an Epigram on a gold serpent bracelet that she wore,\r\n\r\n ARMILLA AUREA LUCRETIAE BORGIAE FERRARIAE DUCIS IN SERPENTIS EFFIGIEM\r\n    FORMATA\r\n\r\n\r\n     “_Dypsas eram: sum facta, Tago dum perluor, aurum\r\n     “tortile nympharum manibus decus; at memor dim\r\n     “Eridani, auditaque tua Lucretia forma,\r\n     “Eliadum ne te caperent electra tuarum,\r\n     “gestandum carae fluvius transmisit alumnae._”\r\n\r\nAnother poet of even greater fame, the limpid Ariosto, praised Madonna\r\nLucrezia as “a second Lucrece, brighter for her virtues than the star of\r\nregal Rome.” And even a modern writer of the eminence of John Addington\r\nSymonds, (who, in his “Renascence” habitually credits calumnies against\r\nBorgia in his text, half-heartedly refuting the same in footnotes,)—even\r\nhe says, “Were they (the calumnies) true, or were they a malevolent lie?\r\nPhysiological speculation will help but little. _Lucrezia shewed all\r\nsigns of a clear conscience._” Precisely. Then it is right and\r\nreasonable to presume that this much-maligned lady had a clear\r\nconscience; and to surcease from shouting any longer in the ordure which\r\nhas been cast upon, and falls from, her fair memory. Let the fact that\r\nHerr Gregorovius, brilliant writer, painstaking scholar, German\r\nProtestant, fierce and unscrupulous foe of the papacy and of the House\r\nof Borgia, has destroyed all accusations against Madonna Lucrezia,\r\nsilence all suspicion. In his huge work,[47] devoted entirely to her\r\nhistory he has shewn her to be the victim of inventions due to the paid\r\npens of her Father’s enemies.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would be contrary to human nature, had Colonna and Savelli meekly\r\nsubmitted to the confiscation of their fiefs. Armed resistance was out\r\nof the question. The heads of those Houses only saved their lives by\r\nflight into exile in discontented Germany: but they were not left\r\nwithout one weapon, the last refuge of the unscrupulous. The anonymous\r\nlibellous pamphlet or epigram lay to their hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lucrezia Borgia Duchess of Ferrara_]\r\n\r\nIn the Region of Monti, (the largest district of Rome, including three\r\nof the seven hills, Quirinal, Esquiline, Caelian,) which was inhabited\r\nby the faction of Colonna, there stood an antique statue of some\r\nriver-god whom the Romans called Marforio. In the Region of Parione by\r\nPiazza Navona, which was the heart of the mediæval City, near Palazzo\r\nBraschi, there stood another antique statue whom the Romans called\r\nPasquino and said that under him the Book of Wisdom for all time was\r\nburied. And it was the fashion to pretend that these two statues\r\nconversed on current topics, emitting epigrams in the darkness of the\r\nnight, which were found in writing on their pedestals in the morning.\r\nAll persons who had an axe to grind at an enemy’s expense made use of\r\nthis convention: and a folio volume would not contain the witty caustic\r\ncynical pasquinades (ecce nomen,) which from the Fifteenth to the\r\nTwentieth Century have been found at Pasquino and Marforio. This method\r\nof spleen-splitting was not neglected by Colonna and Savelli. Pasquino\r\nbecame loquacious, bitter, oh and smart—but, smart! One epigram may be\r\nquoted as a specimen of the railing accusations brought against the\r\nHoliness of the Pope by way of reflection on His alleged simoniacal\r\nelection, at times when He levied taxes or forced loans for the Crusade,\r\nor gave no remission of the chancery fees on promotion to fiefs and\r\nbenefices.\r\n\r\n             “ALEXANDER SELLS THE KEYS, THE ALTARS, CHRIST.\r\n             “HE BOUGHT THEM; AND HE HAS THE RIGHT TO SELL.\r\n\r\nBut the most virulent of all anonymous attacks, was a pamphlet called _A\r\nLetter to Silvio Savelli_ which pretended to have come from the Spanish\r\ncamp at Taranto. It proclaimed to the Elect-Emperor Maximilian and the\r\nsovereigns of Europe the crimes which were said to have been committed\r\nby the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, Duke Cesare de Valentinois and Madonna\r\nLucrezia Borgia d’Este: perfidy, carnage, rapine, adultery, incest, the\r\nheresy of Bulgaria, simony, assassination. Men who have noticed the\r\nrabid inconsequence, the grotesque impossibility and filthiness, which\r\ncharacterises certain foreign abuse of England at the present time, will\r\nunderstand the extent to which envious rage will go. Men of the\r\nTwenty-fifth Century, who read that degenerate literature, may attach to\r\nit an importance as undeserved as that which the Twentieth Century\r\nattaches to the _Letter to Silvio Savelli_ of the Fifteenth. Humanity,\r\nwith slight external differences, is identical in all ages. The Borgia\r\nwere only men and women, boys and girls, when all is said; and the\r\ncharges made against them are infinitely too monstrously inhuman to be\r\ntrue. Nature terribly would have avenged Herself on such infringements\r\nof Her law.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Alexander P.P. VI read the _Letter to Silvio Savelli_. It is\r\nrecorded that His Holiness deigned heartily to laugh with His courtiers\r\nover the exaggerated absurdity of the satire. As for its coarseness—the\r\nRomans always value _simplicitas_ and _urbanitas_ of speech, _i.e._,\r\nhideous grossness and brutal jest. As for taking offence—well, Consul\r\nCaius Julius Caesar laughed at the crabbed little couplet of Caius\r\nValerius Catullus, and invited him to supper; and the Lord Alexander\r\nP.P. VI had lived too many years in Italy not to have taken the correct\r\nmeasure of Milanese, Florentines, Venetians, Neapolitans; and He was\r\nwell able to apportion its just value to extravagance of praise or to\r\nextravagance of blame. With His magnificent dignity of temper, He said\r\nthat in Rome there was liberty of speech: and that He cared nothing for\r\nlibels against Himself. (Costabili to Duke of Ferrara, 1 Feb. 1502).\r\nThey amused Him, if they were witty; they pleased Him, if their language\r\nshewed distinction: and that was all.\r\n\r\nDuke Cesare de Valentinois was not of so gracious a humour. Towards the\r\nend of November after the publication of the _Letter to Silvio Savelli_,\r\na certain Messer Girolamo Manciani, a Neapolitan, was taken in the\r\nRegion of Borgo on a charge of publishing calumnious epigrams against\r\nthe Duke which proved him to be the author of the famous _Letter_. His\r\nright hand and tongue were promptly cut off and out. Two other defamers\r\nemployed by the Aragonese Dynasty (as Pontano had been, and Sannazar\r\n“the Christian Vergil” was) to flout the Borgia underwent a similar\r\nmutilation; and when the Orator of Ferrara spoke of them to the Pope, it\r\nis said that He answered, “What can We do? The Duke means well; but he\r\ndoes not know how to bear insults. We often have advised him to follow\r\nOur ensample, and to let the mob say what it will: but he answered Us\r\nwith choler that he intended to give those scribblers a lesson in good\r\nmanners.” The good heart of the Pope spoke there. The Duke was only\r\ncarrying out the law by this severity; laws, which it would ill-become\r\nthe Lawgiver to set aside. Still, the offence being against the person\r\nof that Lawgiver, it was open to Him privately to recommend leniency:\r\nand that He did. No man could do more.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFlorence, having cast off the despotic rule of the House of Medici, and\r\nsettled herself as a true republic, was at peace with the Holy See.\r\nAfter the capitulation of Faenza Duke Cesare de Valentinois was created\r\nDuke of the Romagna. King Don Federigo of Naples, apprehensive of danger\r\nfrom the alliance of the Papacy and France set abroad the rumour that\r\nthe Duke intended to conquer Florence and add it to the pontifical\r\nstate; and, to curry favour with the Holiness of the Pope, he suggested\r\nthat Tuscany should be erected into a kingdom, with Duke Cesare de\r\nValentinois della Romagna as its crowned king. This attempt to deflect\r\nthe wave of conquest into North Italy, and away from his own dominions,\r\nmet with no success. If Duke Cesare ever had entertained the notion of\r\nproceeding against Tuscany, he made no efforts whatever in that\r\ndirection. On the contrary, it was the Regno that was the object of\r\nattention. Chance after chance had been given, alliances diplomatic and\r\nmatrimonial had been made with it: but it continued to be as a thorn in\r\nthe eye of the papacy, its sovereigns vicious, treacherous, its people\r\ndangerous, degenerate. It was cankered to the core; and its time was\r\ncome. The Lord Alexander P.P. VI signed a treaty with the Christian and\r\nCatholic Kings of France and Spain for the division of Naples. The three\r\nsignatories each had a claim of sorts: the Pope’s Holiness as suzerain\r\nof certain fiefs and tyrannies, such as Benevento and Tarracina; the\r\nChristian King Louis XII as representative of the Angevin dynasty; the\r\nCatholic King Don Hernando as legitimate head of the House of Aragon.\r\nAnd incontinently King Don Federigo de Aragona fled into exile, while\r\nhis kingdom was divided and given to France and Spain.\r\n\r\nIn 1502 the plans of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI for the defence of\r\nChristendom met with success and rebuff. The Elect-Emperor Maximilian\r\nsulkily withdrew his prohibition; and Cardinal Raymond Perauld, as Papal\r\nLegate, passed through the Empire preaching the Crusade. But Hungary\r\nplayed traitor to the League which she had formed with Venice and the\r\nPapacy a year before; and the Majesty of England, King Henry VII Tudor,\r\nrefused to help. The last perhaps may be explained by the uneasy\r\ncondition which the realm owed to rebellions fomented by Burgundy for\r\nthe affliction of the House of Tudor—those of Lambert Simnel in 1487 and\r\nDuke Richard Plantagenet of York (vulgarly called Perkyn Werbecke) in\r\n1494–1499.\r\n\r\nThe movement in the direction of ecclesiastical reform slowly\r\nprogressed. Germany was still reiterating the cry which, as long ago as\r\nthe reign of the Lord Calixtus P.P. III, she had raised anent the\r\nextortions of the Papal Chancery; and not by any means without some\r\nreason. But then, as now, the cry for reform arose from tainted sources.\r\nIt was not genuine, or sincere; but only a species of blackmail. However\r\nthe Lord Alexander P.P. VI was willing enough and he gave the idea due\r\nconsideration, by the advice of Cardinal Francesco de’ Piccolhuomini.\r\nBut, remembering that this Most Illustrious Lord was a nephew of the\r\nLord Pius P.P. II (who, in His earlier years, had assisted at the\r\nCouncil of Basilea); and had the reputation of being a “concilionista,”\r\ni.e., one whose remedy for ecclesiastical ills is not a Pope, but a\r\nCouncil; the Supreme Pontiff resolved to delay, until that He should see\r\nHis way more clearly. In a sense the Pope’s Holiness deceived Himself;\r\nfor Cardinal Francesco de’ Piccolhuomini (who succeeded Him as the Lord\r\nPius P.P. III) was, as Caesar’s wife was not, “above suspicion.” In\r\nordinary matters, when suitable advice is not forthcoming, a Pope is\r\nliable to hesitate. Of course, in matters of teaching, His position is\r\nsecure; but, as has been said, in worldly affairs the Pope-well-advised\r\nis superior to the Pope-ill-advised. Seeing no present method of\r\nsecuring permanent reform, the Lord Alexander P.P. VI waited. The fruit\r\nwas not ripe. The psychological moment had not come. It was well to\r\nwait; and to let the movement shape itself: for, later, when the hour of\r\nreform sounded there arose the majestic Council of Trent. To the Borgia\r\nthe world greatly owes the Tridentine Decrees—decrees that govern the\r\nChurch at this day.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this year 1502, Duke Cesare de Valentinois della Romagna escorted the\r\nLord Alexander P.P. VI to Piombino when he made a state-progress through\r\nthe conquered states; shewing Him that from that city He could threaten\r\nthe Republics of Venice, Siena, and Florence, with the tyrannies of\r\nBologna and Ravenna, the last with its interminable feud of the Sforza\r\nand the Pasolini dell’ Onda.[48] The chief independent states paid\r\ntribute to him. By hideous treachery, he captured the duchies of Urbino\r\nand Camerino, drove the Duke into exile, proclaimed an amnesty, and\r\nobserved it against his worst enemies: but he hanged all those who\r\nbetrayed to him, loving the treachery, hating the traitors.[49] The\r\nduchy of Camerino was conferred upon the four-year-old Duke Giovanni\r\nBorgia of Nepi and Camerino.\r\n\r\nThe Christian King Louis XII had a spasm of envy this year, in\r\nconsequence of Duke Cesare’s phenomenal triumphs; and shewed some signs\r\nof interrupting the policy of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI with cries for\r\na General Council. A model of his, bearing his effigy with the lilies of\r\nFrance and the legend _Perdam Babylonis Nomen_, made a great sensation\r\nin Rome.[50] But French motives never are disinterested. The moment\r\nanother Power wins a success by expenditure of blood and treasure, that\r\nis the time for pretentious incompetent France, _cane che abbaia non\r\nmorde_, to clamour for a share of what she never won, never could hope\r\nto win,—for what, with inconsequent impertinence, she calls\r\n“compensation”! The Holy Roman Church was not worse off, under the rule\r\nof the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, but better off than it had been before:\r\nbut the election of His Holiness was always useful as a means of\r\nblackmail. However, Duke Cesare was Generalissimo of an enormous army.\r\nIn addition to the four thousand condottieri and three hundred lancers\r\nwith which he had begun the campaign, he had enlisted the many thousand\r\nmercenaries of the Tyrants whom he had dispossessed, and also recruited\r\nfar and wide throughout Italy, where all the temperamental fighters\r\ngladly took service under the most successful general. And to these he\r\nadded a foreign battalion of three thousand five hundred fantassini\r\n(infantry), pikemen and arbalisters, all Frenchmen, of whose quality the\r\nChristian King was well aware; and, therefore, sensible enough to\r\nrefrain himself before a worse thing happened to him. Indeed, such was\r\nhis anxiety to give evidence of his desire for peace that he actually\r\noffered,—he, the Christian King of France, the representative of the\r\nAngevin dynasty, offered to resign his claim to the kingdom of Naples in\r\nfavour of Duke Cesare de Valentinois della Romagna. He was painfully\r\nanxious not to purchase a General Council at the cost of the conquest of\r\nFrance; and preferred that a Borgia sovereign, (if such a personage were\r\nto be,) should reign in Naples rather than in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe Romagna immensely was benefited by a strong and decent government\r\nwhere law—martial law, certainly; but law—at last was observed. Duke\r\nCesare’s army was the only great Italian army. He, representing the\r\nPope, was absolute in Central Italy, where no Pope had had direct\r\nauthority for centuries. He was hated; hated by the great baronial\r\nHouses which he had ruined, whose heirs he had slain: but he was not\r\neven disliked by the people whom he ruled.[51] It was not extraordinary;\r\nfor the mob always adores the strong bowelless man, the rigid fearless\r\ndespot, the conquering autocrat who brings peace with security. He took\r\nno different measures against rebellious vassals than those taken by his\r\ncontemporaries, Louis XII of France, Hernando of Spain, Henry VII Tudor\r\nof England. He was more precise, more systematic: that is all. All the\r\nsovereigns who were his contemporaries congratulated him. The Duke was\r\ncruel; almost as cruel as his splendid parallel of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury; and as fervently disliked and decried: but he was just, with a\r\njustice as far above the mawkish humanitarian system of compromise,\r\n(which, nowadays it is the mode to applaud,) as the sun is above the\r\nstars. Through the length and breadth of his dominions he continually\r\nwent, to oversee the restoration of order, to consolidate his victories.\r\nThe slightest spark of opposition he relentlessly crushed out. It was a\r\nhundred-headed hydra with which he had to deal. As he passed from city\r\nto city of his provinces, he left governours in charge of each, bloody\r\nmen, ruthless giants, equal to the work in hand; for the work was\r\ndangerous; and men, whose hearts were triply-cased in hardened bronze,\r\nwere needed, where each man’s life was in his own hands until it was in\r\nhis enemy’s. Messer Lionardo da Vinci, that “scientific sceptic,” was\r\nhis engineer in chief and designer of fortifications: and Messer Niccolo\r\nMachiavelli said that, of all Princes, he could discover no ensample\r\nmore blooming and more vigorous than Duke Cesare. The headquarters of\r\nthe Duke were at Cesena; and that same Messer Niccolo Machiavelli—the\r\nonly man who ever knew the real Cesare (detto Borgia) naked face to\r\nnaked face, naked soul to naked soul,—advised the Signoria of Florence\r\nthat an Orator kept at Cesena would profit the republic more than an\r\nOrator at Rome.[52] In his absences from headquarters, Duke Cesare left\r\nMesser Ramiro d’Orco there as governor. Cesena was a nest of would-be\r\nbrigands. Messer Ramiro d’Orco was a governor who made these quail with\r\nthe steel of his garrison and his own iron will.\r\n\r\nIt was the winter of 1502. Snow lay deeply round Cesena. In the Citadel\r\nthe governor was at supper by the hearth, where huge logs blazed and\r\ncrackled. Halberdiers were standing in attendance; and, on the walls wax\r\ntorches flamed in their sockets, for the sun was set and the first hour\r\nof the night was come. Messer Ramiro d’Orco called for wine; and a page\r\nbrought a fresh flagon from the buffet. He stumbled among the rushes on\r\nthe floor in coming, tripped over the feet of a guard; and the falling\r\nflagon spilled the wine on the ankle of Messer Ramiro d’Orco. That\r\nmonster made no more ado. He took the lad by the belt, and slung him\r\ninto the fire, seizing the nearest halberd and pinning the twitching\r\nbody to the flaming logs. The hair, in a flash, was gone. The slim legs\r\nviolently writhed outward, and fell still. Hose and leathern jerkin\r\npeeled, and the white flesh hissed and blackened. Then, naught but small\r\nash showed where a boy had died; and the smell of roasted human flesh\r\nmingled with the smell of the meats. Again, Messer Ramiro d’Orco called\r\nfor wine, unmoved, only inconvenienced. He was the governor of Cesena:\r\nhe had but punished a clumsy serving-boy.\r\n\r\nThat is the kind of man who could rule in the Romagna: and it easily\r\nwill be understood that acting in this way, armed with plenipotentiary\r\nauthority, Messer Ramiro d’Orco froze his district into a state of\r\ncomparative tranquillity—a state which gave him the opportunity of\r\nlooking further afield, and, so it happened, fatally for himself. A very\r\nlittle cruelty of this callosity goes far. Even truculent Cesena grew\r\nfaint with horror of this fiend.\r\n\r\nDuke Cesare acted upon the principle that it is better to be feared than\r\nloved—_if one must choose_: but he knew that there is a point beyond\r\nwhich no wise ruler goes: he knew the supreme art of making an end.\r\nMurmured rumours of atrocities reached his ears. Sooner or later he\r\nwould have to bear the odium of the ill-deeds of his deputy. He never\r\nshirked responsibility. To shine in the reflected glare of Messer Ramiro\r\nd’Orco’s evil fame would not suit his purpose. And there were other\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-second of December, when the setting sun cast long\r\nblood-red lights across the snow, without warning Duke Cesare gallopped\r\ninto Cesena with an armed escort of lancers. The cowed Cesenesi, turning\r\nout of doors to do him reverence, caught bare glimpses of flashing mail\r\nand the bull-bannerols of Borgia passing over the drawbridge of the\r\ncitadel. Presently, from that citadel came Messer Cipriano di Numai, the\r\nDuke’s secretary, to the house of Messer Domenico d’Ugolini, the\r\ntreasurer; seeking the governor in the city. Messer Ramiro d’Orco was\r\narrested, and conducted to the presence of his chief.\r\n\r\nSurmise that night was rife as to the import of these acts. New\r\nvengeance? New taxes? New horror? None could say.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, letters-patent went to all cities of the Romagna\r\nproclaiming that Duke Cesare had arrested his governor Messer Ramiro\r\nd’Orco, on the charge of numberless frauds, illegal cruelties, and other\r\ncrimes. The plaints of the oppressed had grieved the Duke, natural enemy\r\nof exaction, avarice, and cruelty, who, having freed the citizens from\r\nthe ancient terror, wished to impose no new charges on them. The\r\nletters-patent concluded, “for the doing of justice to Ourself and to\r\nall persons who have been injured, and for a salutary example to all Our\r\nservants present and future, Messer Ramiro d’Orco will stand his trial\r\non depositions against him collected.”\r\n\r\nThe trial was not a long one. Legally put to the Torture of the\r\nQuestion, that frightful ruffian admitted the truth of the said\r\ndepositions; and, chiefly he accused himself of having sold the store of\r\ncorn belonging to the province, applying the price to his own purposes,\r\nto such an extent that Duke Cesare only averted a famine by importing a\r\nfresh supply from foreign countries. Lastly, Messer Ramiro d’Orco\r\nconfessed that he was conspiring with the Orsini to betray to them the\r\ncity of Cesena; and with Don Vitellozzo Vitelli, Tyrant of Citta di\r\nCastello, and Don Oliverotto da Fermo, to pose an arbalister[53] to\r\nassassinate Duke Cesare with a bolt from his arbalist.[54] Citizens of\r\nCesena who passed the little square before the citadel, going to the\r\ndawn-mass of Christmas Day, saw a joyful sight—the Justice of the Duke.\r\nThey saw a glittering axe, fixed in a block upon the snow. They saw on\r\nthe one side a headless body in rich garments, exposed on a\r\nblood-stained mat upon the snow. They saw on the other side the bodiless\r\nhead of Messer Ramiro d’Orco on a pike.\r\n\r\nAll chroniclers of the period congratulate Duke Cesare on having\r\ndelivered his subjects from a tyrannous subaltern as cruel as he was\r\nrapacious; and Machiavelli records that His Excellency was pleased to\r\nshew that he had the power to make men—and to mar them. Duke Cesare in\r\nteaching made use of the sense of sight. He made the peoples of the\r\nRomagna see his power, see his justice, see his ever-present\r\nindefatigable energy. What wonder then that he was looked upon as\r\nsuperhuman. In the citadel of Cesena a milder governor reigned.\r\n\r\nLeaving Cesena on the Festival of St. Stephen, Duke Cesare reached\r\nPesaro on the twenty-eighth of December, where he learned that the\r\nconspirators whom Messer Ramiro d’Orco had betrayed, (except the\r\nBaglioni of Perugia, and Don Giulio and Don Giovanni Orsini who were in\r\nRome with Cardinal Giambattista Orsini and other prelates of their\r\nfaction) were at Sinigaglia, which place they were supposed to be\r\nbesieging on the Duke’s behalf; and they sent to him to announce that\r\nthey had captured the city, but that the governor refused to surrender\r\nthe citadel save to the Generalissimo in person. Duke Cesare sent avant\r\ncouriers heralding his arrival with artillery.\r\n\r\nAt dawn on the Festival of St. Sylvester, the thirty-first of December,\r\nhe appeared before Sinigaglia. His trusty confidant and captain Don\r\nMichelotto led the van with two hundred lancers. Behind these Duke\r\nCesare rode, accompanied by three and a half thousand Italian\r\ncondottieri and as many foreigners. At the city-gate, Don Michelotto\r\nhalted his cavalry on the bridge, and the infantry defiled between their\r\nranks, entering the city where the forces of Don Oliverotto da Fermo\r\nwere paraded. Don Paolo and Don Francesco Orsini, Duke of Gravina, also\r\nwere present, with Don Vitellozzo Vitelli who wore an ermine mantle and\r\nrode a mule like any cardinal. Duke Cesare appeared to be pleased at\r\nseeing them and allowed them to kiss his hand in the French style. The\r\natrocious character of these brigands already has been described.\r\n\r\nDuke Cesare engaged them in conversation, siding with Don Francesco\r\nOrsini and Don Vitellozzo Vitelli. When they reached the palace which he\r\nwas to occupy, the four prepared to take their leave; but he begged them\r\nto stay and dine, and to assist him in certain deliberations. As soon as\r\nthey had crossed the threshold, the Duke’s gentlemen made them\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nMesser Niccolo Machiavelli, the official representative of the Signoria\r\nof Florence on the staff of Duke Cesare, (a capacity equivalent to that\r\nof foreign attaché with an army in the field,) reached Sinigaglia later\r\nin the day; and found the city filled with the Ducal mercenaries, who\r\nwere engaged in stripping the troops of the conspirators and in doing a\r\nlittle pillage of some Venetian merchants. He was going to the palace to\r\nget the news, when Duke Cesare, rode out, armed cap-à-pie, and said to\r\nhim, “I have had a chance, and I have taken it; and I have done a\r\nservice that should cause your Signoria to rejoice.” Then he rode away\r\nand reduced his turbulent troops to order.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the fate of the conspirators was decided. In deference\r\nto their rank, the two Orsini were to be sent to Rome and judged there\r\naccording to law: meanwhile they were detained at the palace of\r\nSinigaglia under guard. The trial of the others began at once. Put to\r\nthe Torture of the Question in the usual manner, they soon shewed of\r\nwhat poor stuff they were made. The lily-livered assassin Don Oliverotto\r\nda Fermo wept and groaned and reproached Don Vitellozzo Vitelli with\r\nhaving led him—innocent lamb as he was—into mischief by inducing him to\r\nintrigue against Duke Cesare. On the first day of the new year 1503, at\r\nfour o’clock in the morning, they were ceremonially strangled in the\r\ncourtyard of the palace. While Don Vitellozzo was struggling with the\r\ncarnefex, dying by slow degrees, with blackening face and bulging eyes,\r\nhe screamed continually to Duke Cesare begging hard that he would\r\nimplore the Lord Alexander P.P. VI to grant him absolution after death\r\nand a plenary indulgence, until the red cord (which was his baronial\r\nprivilege) cut into his gullet, and stilled his swollen tongue.\r\n\r\nAn ensample of this kind can leave no doubt in the mind but that, in\r\nspite of all to the contrary, the Pontifex Maximus of Rome, simoniacally\r\nelected or not, implicitly and explicitly was regarded then as God’s\r\nVicegerent, as Earthly Vicar of Christ, by the most flagitious of men.\r\nThen what can be thought of the good and clean-living majority?\r\n\r\nThe bodies were buried in the chapel of the hospice of the Misericordia,\r\nthe Brotherhood of Pity, one of whose obligations is the care of\r\ncriminals condemned on the capital charge.\r\n\r\nThis account of the _colpo-di-stato_ of Sinigaglia differs from that to\r\nwhich the world is accustomed. It is said that, when Messer Niccolo\r\nMachiavelli returned to Florence, he was induced to make a different\r\nstatement to the one which he previously had made from personal\r\nobservation in his first dispatches. According to this second version,\r\nthere was no conspiracy; and the brigands Vitelli and da Fermo were\r\nsimply massacred by order of Duke Cesare. It is the execrable Messer\r\nFrancesco Guicciardini who has prostituted his golden pen to record this\r\nso-called version of Machiavelli, which has come to be regarded as\r\nveracious history.\r\n\r\n  “Duke Cesare de Valentinois, acknowledged sovereign of the Romagna,\r\n  judged his subjects who were guilty of high treason: as chief of the\r\n  State, he condemned the assassins who sought his life: as\r\n  generalissimo, he punished treacherous and rebellious subalterns. It\r\n  is known from other sources, that these two barons were only brigands\r\n  stained with murders, and that their death was a deliverance for\r\n  Italy. Without insisting on this point, and if it be said that the\r\n  procedure of Duke Cesare was odious,—the capture by a ruse and the\r\n  summary execution,—it may be pointed out that everywhere and in all\r\n  ages criminals are taken by whatever method may be possible, and that\r\n  military tribunals have never wasted time in long formalities. There\r\n  was accusation, trial, and execution, all in regular though rapid\r\n  form. We well may call the action of Duke Cesare a coup-d’-Etat. He is\r\n  not more blameworthy than the Emperor Napoleon III who in 1852 was\r\n  loudly applauded. Neither is it necessary for his justification to\r\n  urge the barbarous customs of his age; for we should be forced to\r\n  remember that, in the Nineteenth Century, our (French) national hero,\r\n  in a time of peace, caused to be seized on foreign territory, to be\r\n  carried to Vincennes, and, after the mockery of a trial, to be shot\r\n  like a dog in the castle-ditch, an innocent man who was a prince of\r\n  the blood-royal of France. [Duc d’Enghien?] Yet no man has ever dared\r\n  to liken the Emperor Napoleon I to a Borgia! (_Réné, Comte de\r\n  Maricourt._)\r\n\r\nThe news reached Rome on the night of the second of January. The blow\r\nhad been struck with such rapidity as to put complicity of the Lord\r\nAlexander beyond the dimensions of time and space.\r\n\r\nIn the Eternal City, the year had opened with the ceremony called\r\nL’Ubbedienza, in which the cardinals renew their vow of fidelity to the\r\nPope, as, formerly, Roman Senators vowed fidelity to the Princeps on\r\neach New Year’s Day. A cardinal, who would omit this duty except for a\r\nvalid reason, would cause precisely such a scandal as P. Thrasea Paetus\r\ncaused to Tacitus by neglecting to swear to Nero. Notwithstanding this\r\nrenewal of allegiance on the first of January, only three days later the\r\nPope’s Holiness found reason to arrest Cardinal Giambattista Orsini,\r\nwith Archbishop Alviano of Florence, and Don Giacomo Poplicola di\r\nSantacroce, Orsini’s partisans, being determined once for all to crush\r\nthat House of incorrigible rebels. This Don Giacomo Poplicola di\r\nSantacroce had only himself to blame. His House, the most illustrious of\r\nall the sixty conscript families of Rome, had been outlawed in 1482 by\r\nthe Lord Xystus P.P. IV by reason of the furious feud between Santacroce\r\nand Dellavalle which had turned the Eternal City for months together\r\ninto shambles. He should have known better than to put his head in the\r\nlion’s mouth. Giustiniani, the Orator of Venice, received an account of\r\nwhat had happened from the Pope’s Own mobile lips; and embodied the same\r\nin a dispatch to his government dated the fourth of January 1503. It\r\nappears to be perfectly logical on the part of the Pope’s Holiness,\r\nthat, in view of the coming trial of the two Orsini whom Duke Cesare was\r\nbringing to Rome, evidence should be sought among the members of their\r\nfaction.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of Orsini was impolitic and suspicious to the last degree.\r\nThey were under the shadow. Two of their alleged accomplices had been\r\nexecuted at Sinigaglia. The cardinal was detained in the Mola of\r\nHadrian. Don Paolo Orsini and Duke Francesco Orsini of Gravina were\r\nprisoners of Duke Cesare. Their circumstances required a patient policy\r\nof inaction pending coming trial, the result of which they needed not to\r\nfear supposing them to be innocent of conspiracy. On the contrary, they\r\ngave clear evidence of guilt, desperately maintaining an armed rebellion\r\nin pontifical territory, ravaging the Viterbo country, and continuing to\r\nmake leagues with other rebels whether these were Roman barons or chiefs\r\nof independent banditti.\r\n\r\nThe Orator of Venice wrote to his government on the seventeenth of\r\nJanuary: “The Pontiff is much disturbed, and more than ever on his\r\nguard. They say that Colonna and Savelli and all the discontented barons\r\nhave joined Orsini. This night there was a panic at the Vatican: no one\r\nknows the cause. The captain of the guard called out his troops and\r\nwatched all night under arms.”\r\n\r\nPrince Gioffredo Borgia of Squillace, now in his twenty-second year and\r\nfather of four children, raised a squadron of condottieri and attacked\r\nhis August Father’s enemies: but on the night of the twentieth of\r\nJanuary, the Orsini cavalry captured the Bridge of Nomentano where a\r\nfortress was; and all the Borgo rose in tumult. Messer Francesco\r\nRemolino Bishop of Sorrento, and the Orator of Siena, left the City for\r\nthe camp of Duke Cesare carrying orders that he should leave everything\r\nand advance on Rome, which was in imminent peril. But before the envoys\r\nreached him, on the night of the seventeenth of January, at Citta di\r\nPieve he suddenly had beheaded Don Paolo Orsini and Duke Francesco\r\nOrsini of Gravina, the two prisoners to whom he had promised a legal\r\ntrial in Rome. The attitude of Orsini perfectly justified Duke Cesare in\r\nexercising his rights as sovereign justiciary and breaking his promise.\r\nHis camp was surrounded by Orsini castles, the two barons undoubtedly\r\nwere caught in the article of conspiracy; and their summary decapitation\r\nbecame a sudden necessity to intimidate the Orsini conspirators in and\r\nabout Rome. It was not the custom of the Sixteenth Century to mince\r\nmatters, from any silly humanitarian motives, by sacrificing thousands\r\nof proletariat lives when the fierce slaughter of a brace of\r\nnotabilities would serve the purpose. The modern accusation, that the\r\nLord Alexander P.P. VI was privy to the execution of these two Orsini,\r\nfalls to the ground when the dates of His dispatches to Duke Cesare, and\r\nof their deaths, are compared.\r\n\r\nCardinal Giambattista Orsini remained a state-prisoner in the Mola of\r\nHadrian, within whose walls he had full liberty. By his own request, his\r\nfood was sent in daily from his own House; and also he received visits\r\nfrom his relations. There he lived, attended by his own physicians,\r\nuntil the twenty-second of February when he died, and was buried in the\r\nchurch of San Salvatore _in Lauro_. Soon it was said that the Pope’s\r\nHoliness had envenomed him; and this is a charge which it is utterly\r\ndifficult to prove.\r\n\r\nGiustiniani, the Orator of Venice, who was a friend of the House of\r\nOrsini, and always inimical to the Borgia, said without explanation or\r\nremark in a dispatch to his government dated the fifteenth of February:\r\n“The Lord Cardinal Orsini in prison shews signs of frenzy.”\r\n\r\nIn the dispatch dated the twenty-second of February, he said: “The Lord\r\nCardinal Orsini is reduced to the last extremity, and his physicians say\r\nthat there is no hope of saving his life.”\r\n\r\nIn the dispatch dated the twenty-third of February, he said: “I give\r\nnotice that, yesterday, after the departure of my courier, the Lord\r\nCardinal Orsini died; and this evening, with an honourable escort, he\r\nwas taken to the church of San Salvatore, and there interred.”\r\n\r\nBrancatalini, in his Diarium, wrote: “This day XXII February 1503,\r\nCardinal Orsini left the Castle of Santangelo dead, at a half-hour of\r\nthe night; (5.30–6 P.M.) and Mariano di Stefano with many other Romans\r\naccompanied him; and he was borne to San Salvatore _in Lauro_.”\r\n\r\nSoderini, Orator of the Signoria of Florence, in a dispatch dated the\r\ntwenty-third of February 1503 wrote to his government:\r\n\r\n  “Cardinal Orsini died yesterday: and was buried at the twenty-fourth\r\n  hour (5–5.30 P.M.) at San Salvatore the church of the House of Orsini;\r\n  and, by order of the Pope, the body was escorted by his relations, and\r\n  by the cardinals of the Curia, uncovered and resting on a bier draped\r\n  with cloth-of-gold, vested in a red chasuble brocaded with golden\r\n  flowers, on the head was a white mitre, and at the feet were two hats\r\n  in token of his cardinalitial rank. The monks performed the funeral\r\n  service; and there were about sixty or seventy lighted torches. May he\r\n  rest in peace.”\r\n\r\nObviously, the Orators of the Powers had no suspicion of venom.\r\nGiustiniani gladly would have reported such a rumour had he found\r\nhimself in a position to do so which would have been consistent with his\r\ndignity and duty to the Venetian Senate. When He heard what His enemies\r\nwere saying, the Lord Alexander P.P. VI took prompt action. On the day\r\nafter the obsequies He convoked the physicians who had attended the dead\r\nCardinal during his illness and agony; and required them to certify that\r\ndeath was owed to natural causes without any violence due to venom or\r\nother means; He made them swear on the Sacrament to the truth of their\r\ndepositions, which were recorded with the facts of the case in the usual\r\nform.\r\n\r\nIt was customary to consider certain signs as indicating venom; _e.g._,\r\nthe spots, the colour, the odour of the corpse. There is no mention made\r\nof these. The Pope’s Holiness ordered a public funeral, the body was\r\nuncovered; and carried openly through Rome. Every one might see it; and,\r\nhad the Orsini faction discovered any signs which pointed to an\r\nunnatural death, they surely would have proclaimed their suspicions. The\r\ninterment on the day after death was, and is, the wholesome Roman\r\ncustom. The hour, after sunset, was, and is, the hour of burial.\r\n\r\nIt has been said by modern idealists that the Lord Alexander P.P. VI\r\nenvenomed Cardinal Orsini in order to inherit his riches. The idea is\r\nabsurd and ridiculous; for the Orsini would have been the heirs of their\r\ndead kinsman. In fact they were. The imputation discredits itself by\r\nreason of the gross ignorance on which it is based. It is alleged that\r\nthe Pope is the heir-at-law of cardinals. He is. But He was not, in the\r\nreign of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI. It was the Lord Julius P.P. II\r\n(1503–1513) who cupidinously issued the Bull which names the Roman\r\nPontiff heir-at-law of all cardinals, and of all clergy dying in Rome;\r\nand this Pope (as Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere) was no friend to\r\nBorgia. And this fact ought to dispose of all allegations of cupidinal\r\nmotive in this, as in other cases.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Alexander P.P. VI had the Orsini at His mercy. Duke Cesare had\r\nexecuted two chiefs of that House. The Cardinal was secure in the\r\nimpregnable Mola of Hadrian. If the Pope’s Holiness had wished to rid\r\nHimself of this one He was quite strong enough to do so, without resort\r\nto venom, by a regular execution in public, or in private if preferred,\r\nand so defy the odium which inevitably attends the exhibition of venom.\r\nBut that He had no intention of visiting His prisoners with death, or\r\nwith anything more than incarceration to keep them out of mischief, may\r\nbe seen from the fact that a few months later (August 1503) Archbishop\r\nAlviano of Florence was released alive and well from the Mola of\r\nHadrian.\r\n\r\nAs there appears to have been no motive and no necessity for the alleged\r\ncrime, so also there appears to have been no possibility of its\r\ncommission. Cardinal Giambattista Orsini was visited daily by his\r\npeople, and his food was brought to him by them. His physicians also\r\nmade deposition on oath that his death was not caused by venom.\r\n\r\nIt is only reasonable to conjecture, then, that being a very old man,\r\n_conscius criminis sui_ (conspiracy), alarmed by the execution of his\r\naccomplices, terrified at his own peril, he succumbed to an entirely\r\nnatural collapse. The dysentery, which carried him off, goes to support\r\nthis theory,\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe French in the Regno were not prospering; and the favour of the\r\npapacy appeared to be leaning towards Spain. The Crusade languished, not\r\nfor lack of funds (for the Pope’s Holiness envoyed a grant of money to\r\nHungary); but because of the want of martial spirit on the part of, and\r\nthe customary disgraceful dissensions among the Christian Powers. Venice\r\nand Hungary threw up the sponge, and came to terms with the Muslim\r\nInfidel. The conquest of Eastern Europe and the settlement of the Turks\r\ntherein was an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuke Cesare de Valentinois della Romagna occupied Pesaro. This was the\r\nfief of that young Tyrant, Don Giovanni Sforza, whose marriage with\r\nMadonna Lucrezia Borgia had been annulled by a canonical impediment. The\r\nspoliation of his appanage was a ground of fresh offence. The rupture\r\nbetween the Houses of Borgia and Sforza was irremediable. People spoke\r\nof Duke Cesare, now, as the Caesar Augustus of a new Roman Empire,\r\nindependent, and ruled by the sceptre of a Princeps of the House of\r\nBorgia. After the execution of the conspirators at Sinigaglia, the\r\nVenetian chronicler Priuli, who loathed the very name of Borgia, wrote\r\non the eleventh of January 1503: “Some wish to make and crown him King\r\nof Italy; others wish to make him Emperor: for he prospers so that no\r\none dare forbid him anything.”[55]\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a Borgia Dynasty would have been no treason against\r\nthe rights of the Papacy. The rebellious tyrants whom Duke Cesare had\r\noverthrown were unprofitable and even menacing. In their place was the\r\nDuke who brought law, order, and prosperity. Of course Duke Cesare\r\nderived benefit from his victories. The labourer is worthy of his hire,\r\nand even successful English generals are not begrudged their peerages.\r\nDuke Cesare’s duchy of Romagna, his commanding position, his power to\r\nenrich himself by the taxation of his subjects, were a fair reward for\r\nthe immense services which he had rendered. The Papacy had now, instead\r\nof a lost territory infested by the scum of European ruffianry refusing\r\nto acknowledge authority or natural law, a vast province inhabited by\r\nlaw-abiding prosperous contented vassals ready and glad to pay the\r\ntraditional tribute to their over-lord, in return for the unwonted\r\nsafety of their lives and property. Duke Cesare was in the position of a\r\nviceroy. He held office at the pleasure of the Roman Pontiff. He was\r\npersona ingrata to the rulers of the other Italian states, who were\r\nenvious of his splendid beauty, of his imperious character, of his\r\nextraordinary success, and of his tremendous potentiality. And they\r\nfeared this tawny prince who had the tiger-strength to crush them one\r\nand all. Backed by the spiritual and temporal influence and wealth of\r\nthe Pontiff, he could keep his irresistible army of veterans always on a\r\nwar-footing, and himself its generalissimo; and so the Papacy itself\r\nacquired, through him, and in him, and for the first time, a material\r\nbasis of independence: while, in opposition to the Pope, he could not\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nThere was the policy of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI.\r\n\r\nHe planned it with deliberation. He spared no pains to put it into\r\neffect. He did not want to ruin the Church, because She was the\r\nfoundation upon which He would build His dynasty. Something of the kind\r\nwas of absolute and imperious necessity. The Forged Decretals and\r\nDonation of Constantine, (which foist had been put forth in a Brief of\r\nthe Lord Hadrian P.P. I to the Emperor Charlemagne,) “the magic pillars\r\nof the spiritual and temporal monarchy of the Popes,” severely had been\r\ncriticized as early as the Twelfth Century. It was left, however, to\r\nMesser Lorenzo della Valla mercilessly to denounce them as forgeries in\r\n1440, as already has been shewn here. When the Lord Alexander P.P. VI\r\nascended the pontifical throne fifty-two years later, both Decretals and\r\nDonation had been thrown overboard from the Barque of Peter, to lighten\r\nthe ship: and the Pope had no title-deeds to shew, forged or otherwise,\r\nfor Peter’s Patrimony. Any diplomatist would see that a right, of some\r\nkind more inexpugnable than Prescription, was desirable. The Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI chose Conquest, and the Founding of a Borgia Dynasty.\r\nThe office of the Church He magnified, that She the better might help\r\nthe state. He intended that His descendants, members of the House of\r\nBorgia, though nominally the vassals should be the suzerains of His\r\nSuccessors: that Borgia should wear the double-crown of Princeps, as\r\nwell as, and by means of the triple crown of Pontifex Maximus,—that a\r\ndynasty of Borgia should occupy both pontifical and imperial thrones.\r\n\r\nThere was ruin in the scheme: but not that ruin which vulgarly might be\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nIt was an intelligent enough policy—of a worldly sort. Only—it was not\r\ninspired by religion, nor restrained by morality. When it fell to\r\npieces, the Lord Julius P.P. II was able of its fragments alone to build\r\nthe Papal States which lasted more than three centuries and a half until\r\n1870.\r\n\r\nThe power of the House of Borgia was so well founded that the mere death\r\nof the Lord Alexander P.P. VI would not have affected it. There was a\r\nstrong party of Spanish cardinals in the Sacred College, and three of\r\nthese were of the House of Borgia. The Vicegerent of Rome, the Lord\r\nJaime Serra, Cardinal-Priest of the Title of San Vitale, was a Spaniard\r\nalso. The Roman barons, Colonna, Orsini, Savelli, Dellavalle were\r\nbroken; Poplicola di Santacroce outlawed; Sforza-Visconti of Milan,\r\nSforza of Santafiora, Sforza of Chotignuola, Sforza of Pesaro,\r\nSforza-Riario of Imola and Forli, all were exiled. The Roman Cesarini\r\nwere loyal to Borgia, and had their Cardinal (Giuliano) in the Curia.\r\nSpain was friendly, and occupied in the New World. France was friendly,\r\nand feeble. Germany was feeble and internally distracted. England was\r\nonly a fifth-rate power. And the invincible army of Duke Cesare de\r\nValentinois della Romagna was ready to carry into effect its leader’s\r\nwill. But chance, molecules, Providence,—the reader will\r\nchoose,—disabled Duke Cesare, made him unable to act, or unwilling to\r\nact,—the reader again will choose,—at the very moment when his action\r\nwas imperatively necessary. If, on the death of the Lord Alexander P.P.\r\nVI he had had his health, he easily might have done anything, said\r\nMachiavelli.[56]\r\n\r\n              “The Worldly Hope Men set their Hearts upon\r\n              Turns Ashes—or it prospers; and, anon,\r\n                  Like Snow upon the Desert’s dusty Face,\r\n              Lighting a little Hour or two—is gone.[57]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the Ninth Consistory of the thirtieth (or thirty-first) of May (or\r\nJune) 1503, the Lord Alexander P.P. VI named nine cardinals; five of\r\nwhom were Spaniards, three Italians, and one German. They were:\r\n\r\n  (α) the Lord Don Juan de Castellar, Bishop of Oleron;\r\n        Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Maria _in Trastevere\r\n        tit. Calixtus_:\r\n\r\n  (β) the Lord Don Francisco Remolino, Bishop of Sorrento, a friend of\r\n        Duke Cesare; Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San Giovanni e\r\n        San Paolo:\r\n\r\n  (γ) the Lord Don Francisco de Sprata, Bishop of Leon;\r\n        Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San Sergio e San Bacco:\r\n\r\n  (δ) the Lord Francesco Soderini da Volterra, Canon of the Vatican\r\n        Basilica; Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Susanna\r\n        _inter Duas Domos_:\r\n\r\n  (ε) the Lord Niccolo da Flisco, Bishop of Forli, Orator of the\r\n        Republic of Genoa to the Christian King; Cardinal-Presbyter of\r\n        the Title of Santa Prisca:\r\n\r\n  (ζ) the Lord Adriano Castellense di Corneto, Orator of the Lord\r\n        Innocent P.P. VIII to Britannia Barbara (Scotland);\r\n        Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San Crisogono:\r\n\r\n  (η) the Lord Melchior Copis, Bishop of Brixen; Cardinal-Presbyter of\r\n        the Title of San Niccolo _inter Imagines_:\r\n\r\n  (θ) the Lord Don Jaime Casanova, Apostolic Prothonotary;\r\n        Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San Stefano _in Monte Celio_:\r\n\r\n  (ι) the Lord Don Francisco Iloris, Apostolic Treasurer,\r\n        Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria Nuova.\r\n\r\nWhy a learned Catholic historian[58] should go out of his way to call\r\nthis a simoniacal creation, and his English editor to repeat the\r\ncalumny, is hard to say. It is bad policy to cry stinking fish, at all\r\ntimes; it is especially silly to do so when the fish are fresh. The Bull\r\n_De Simoniaca Electione_ directed against Simony was not issued until\r\n1505, in the reign of the Lord Julius P.P. II; and it was not\r\nretrospective. In 1503, the Lord Alexander P.P. VI was actually a\r\ntemporal sovereign, “an Italian Despot with certain sacerdotal\r\nadditions.” The cardinals were the highest degree of His peerage. No\r\ndoubt they paid for their promotion in the usual way; fees to officials,\r\nthe crusade tax on the revenues of their Titles, perhaps even a handsome\r\ncontribution to the Treasury: but why call this Simony, when it was not\r\nSimony _stricte dicte_ till two years later? A Red Hat no more can be\r\nbought than Strawberry Leaves. A man may use his gold to recommend\r\nhimself for these head-gears. A man may present £25,000 to the best of\r\nall princesses’ Hospital Fund, or land worth a quarter of a million to\r\nthe proletariat; he may “bang a saxpence” in fees to officials for his\r\nknighthood, he even may pay pounds sterling in fees to officials for his\r\nbarony: but he righteously would be enraged if people said that he had\r\nbought his knighthood or his barony. The word Simony must be taken as\r\nbelonging to the Genus _Blessed_, (_e.g._, Mesopotamia;) or as the bark\r\nof a dog who dare not bite. Either it is a mere incantation; or a\r\nwar-whoop “full of sound and fury signifying nothing.” In sober logical\r\nearnest, it is inapplicable here.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the heat of summer increased, the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, now of the\r\nage of seventy-two years, used to sit and take the air in the shady\r\ngardens of the Vatican, and amuse Himself by watching two little boys at\r\nplay. They were His bastard and his grandson; Duke Giovanni Borgia of\r\nNepi and Camerino, of the age of five years; and Duke Roderico of\r\nSermoneta, Madonna Lucrezia’s son, of the age of four years.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the sun entered the constellation of Leo—Sol in Leone, the\r\ndog-days—the heat became abnormal; and plague and fevers appeared in\r\nRome.[59] The Orators of the Powers promptly made arrangements to quit\r\nthe City, for a cool and wholesome villegiatura.\r\n\r\nDon Antonio Giustiniani, the Orator of Venice, sent to his Senate a\r\ndispatch dated the eleventh of July 1503, in which he wrote: “I went to\r\nthe palace; and, on entering His apartment, I found our Lord the Pope in\r\nHis habits reclining on a couch. He received me with good humour, saying\r\nthat for three days He had been inconvenienced by a slight dysentery,\r\nbut that He hoped it would be unimportant.”\r\n\r\nOn the next day Giustiniani wrote: “The Pope’s Holiness reviewed His\r\ntroops from a balcony.”\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth of July, he wrote again: “I went to the palace; and,\r\non entering, I found His Holiness on His throne in the Hall of Pontiffs.\r\nHe was a little depressed: but looked well.”\r\n\r\nMesser Francesco Fortucci, the Orator of Florence, sent to his Signoria\r\na dispatch dated the twentieth of July, in which he wrote: “There are\r\nmany people sick of fevers, and many have died.”\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-second of July, he wrote: “I thank the Signoria for leave\r\nof absence, because I myself am uneasy, and almost out of my mind with\r\nfright; for so many people are dying of fever, and there is also\r\nsomething like the Pest.”\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the fifth of August, the Lord Alexander P.P. VI rode\r\nwith Duke Cesare and several prelates to a supper _al fresco_ at the\r\nvilla of the Cardinal of San Crisogono outside the walls. Rome and the\r\nsurrounding country are particularly unwholesome, though cool, during\r\nthe hour after sunset. It is said that the Holiness of the Pope was much\r\nheated by the exertion of riding there; and that, while He was in this\r\ncondition, He drank a cup of wine for the sake of coolness. No more\r\nhazardous action can be imagined; except on the part of one desiring to\r\ncourt a malarial fever.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, on the seventh of August, the Orator Giustiniani wrote\r\nto his government: “I found the Pope less cheerful and more dull than\r\nusual. He said to me _Sir Orator, all these sick people in Rome, all\r\nthese daily deaths, make Us fearful, and persuade Us to take more care\r\nof Our person._”\r\n\r\nMonsignor Hans Burchard, the Caerimonarius, wrote in his Diarium: “On\r\nthe twelfth of August, after vespers, between the twenty-first and\r\ntwenty-second hour, (5–6 P.M.) He (the Pope’s Holiness) shewed signs of\r\na fever which does not abate.”\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that this is seven days after the garden-supper.\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth of August, Giustiniani wrote to his sovereign the Doge\r\nof Venice, that the Pope had vomited after eating, and had been feverish\r\nall night; that Duke Cesare also was sick: and that no one was admitted\r\nto the Vatican. He tells about the supper in the garden of the Cardinal\r\nof San Crisogono; and adds: “To-morrow morning I will try to have\r\nprecise information to send to Your Sublimity.”\r\n\r\nThese dispatches give an excellent idea of some of the duties of a\r\nSixteenth Century ambassador, to hang about doors of palaces, to\r\nchronicle performances of natural functions, to bribe royal flunkeys and\r\nreport their gossip in state-dispatches.\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth of August, the same Orator wrote that the Pope had\r\nbeen phlebotomized,—“some speak of fourteen, some of sixteen ounces:\r\nperhaps it will be true to say ten; and that is an enormous quantity for\r\na man of seventy-three years, which is the age of His Blessedness.”\r\n\r\n(The Lord Alexander P.P. VI was born in 1431; and was of the age of\r\nseventy-two years in 1503.)\r\n\r\n“Still the fever does not abate. The Pope has it yet; though less\r\nviolently than yesterday. To-day the Duke is worse.”\r\n\r\nThe same day, the fourteenth of August, Don Beltrando Costabili, the\r\nOrator of Duke Ercole of Ferrara wrote at some length, no doubt because\r\nMadonna Lucrezia Borgia, the consort of Ferrara’s heir, would expect\r\ndetailed information when the health of her august and affectionate\r\nFather was concerned. He said:\r\n\r\n  “Yesterday morning, I was informed on good authority that His Holiness\r\n  has commanded the attendance of the Bishop of Venosa who was sick at\r\n  home, and of another physician of the City; and that these are not\r\n  allowed to leave him. I was informed that the Pope had vomitings and\r\n  fever yesterday: and that they have relieved him of nine ounces of\r\n  blood. During the day, His Holiness caused some cardinals to play at\r\n  cards before Him while He rested. I was informed also that last night\r\n  He slept fairly well. But to-day between the eighteenth and nineteenth\r\n  hour, (2–3 P.M.) there was a crisis like that of Saturday, of a kind\r\n  which makes His courtiers uneasy; and every one is unwilling to speak\r\n  of His condition. I have sought by all means to obtain information:\r\n  but the more I seek, the less I learn; for the physicians, the\r\n  chirurgeons, and the apothecaries are not allowed to quit the\r\n  Presence: from which I conclude that the malady is grave. The Duke of\r\n  the Romagna also, is very sick with fever, vomitings, and disorder of\r\n  the stomach. _It is not astonishing that His Holiness, and His\r\n  Excellency should be ill; for all the courtiers, especially those who\r\n  are in the palace, are in the same state, by reason of the unwholesome\r\n  conditions of the air, which, there, they breathe._”\r\n\r\nThe last sentence, in italics, is of exceedingly great importance. The\r\noperation of venesection did not effect a lysis, as appears from the\r\ndispatches of Giustiniani which continue the tale. On the fifteenth of\r\nAugust, he wrote to the Venetian Senate that it was difficult to get\r\npositive information: but that the affair was serious; and, that there\r\nwas likely to be disorder in the City if the Pope died.\r\n\r\nOn the sixteenth of August, he wrote that the Pope and the Duke\r\ncontinued to be tormented with fevers, and that the Duke’s was the more\r\nviolent. He added that the condition of the Pope must be aggravated by\r\nHis anxieties and cares, and by the sickness of the Duke.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth of August, Giustiniani wrote again:\r\n\r\n  “Yesterday I wrote to Your Sublimity by Girolamo Passamonte the\r\n  courier, who arrived here. To-day I inform you that our Lord the Pope\r\n  has taken medicine. The fever continually torments Him, not without\r\n  danger. I am informed by a sure authority that the Bishop of Venosa,\r\n  chief-physician of His Blessedness and a familiar of the Cardinal\r\n  Giovantonio di Sangiorgio, (or, perhaps, the Cardinal of San Giorgio\r\n  _in Velum Aureum_, Rafaele Galeotto Sansoni-Riario,) has told his\r\n  steward that the sickness of the Pope is very dangerous, and that he\r\n  ought to make the said cardinal hasten hither; which thing has been\r\n  done.”\r\n\r\nHe adds that the partisans of Duke Cesare, expecting a riot on the death\r\nof the Pope, have made secure their property and have taken precautions\r\nto prevent ill news from being bruited abroad. This was ordinary\r\npolitical prudence.\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth of August, the same Orator wrote,\r\n\r\n  “Early this morning, our Lord the Pope, knowing of the danger of His\r\n  sickness, has received His rites; and some cardinals have been\r\n  admitted into the presence of His Blessedness. The Viaticum was given\r\n  in secret; for His familiars try to conceal His condition as much as\r\n  possible. They say, that the Bishop of Venosa, early this morning\r\n  before the Communion, came from the Pope’s Chamber, weeping, and\r\n  saying to one of his people that the danger was very grave, and\r\n  complaining with chagrin of the inefficacy of some potions which,\r\n  yesterday, he had administered.... The Duke also is very sick. It has\r\n  been said to my secretary, _Sir Secretary, this is no time for\r\n  ceremonies or fine words. Tell the Orator to hasten to inform the\r\n  Senate of Venice that the Pope_ GRAVITER LABORAT. Also, the same\r\n  informant said that the Pope cannot live much longer without a\r\n  miracle.”\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth of August, Giustiniani also wrote a second dispatch to\r\nthe Doge of Venice, in which he said:\r\n\r\n  “To-day I sent the latest news to Your Sublimity by Lorenzo da\r\n  Camerino. After he was gone, Messer Scipione, a physician from the\r\n  palace, came to tell me that yesterday at the sixteenth hour (noon),\r\n  the Pope, wishing to rise for a certain need, was taken with a fit of\r\n  choking, and is in evil plight, going from bad to worse; and that in\r\n  his opinion His Holiness will die to-night:—and, from what he says, I\r\n  judge the malady to be an apoplexy. Such also is the opinion of this\r\n  physician so excellent is his art.”\r\n\r\nThe Orator adds that, now, Duke Cesare is neglected; and is preparing\r\nsecretly to take refuge in the Mola of Hadrian.\r\n\r\nMonsignor Burchard makes the following entry in his Diarium, a work of\r\nwhich the original is undiscovered, and copies only accessible to the\r\nstudent. He was perfectly qualified to speak on this subject from\r\npersonal knowledge; the demise of the Pope being a ceremonial function\r\nwhich he would have to arrange and superintend. He says:\r\n\r\n  “On Wednesday the eighteenth of August between the twelfth and\r\n  thirteenth hour (8–9 A.M.) He (the Lord Alexander P.P. VI) confessed\r\n  Himself to the Lord Bishop Pietro of Culen who said mass in His\r\n  presence; and, after his Communion, administered the Sacrament of the\r\n  Eucharist to the Pope, who was seated on His bed; and then finished\r\n  the mass. Five cardinals were present, d’Oristano, di Cosenza, di\r\n  Monreale,[60] Casanueva, and di Constantinople, to whom the Pope said\r\n  that He felt ill. At the hour of vespers the said Bishop of Culen\r\n  administered the Sacrament of Extreme Unction to Him; and He died in\r\n  the presence of the datary and the bishop.”\r\n\r\nThis event took place in the third room of the Borgia Tower occupied by\r\nthe Library counting from the Library side.\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth of August, Giustiniani announced the news to the\r\nSenate, and added, “to-day He was carried _de moro_,[61] and shewn to\r\nthe people; but His corpse was more hideous and monstrous than words can\r\ntell, and without human form. For decency, it was kept for some time\r\ncovered; and before sunset they buried it in the presence of two of the\r\ncardinal-deacons attached to the palace.”\r\n\r\nIn reading this dispatch, it must be remembered that Giustiniani hated\r\nthe Borgia; and that the Lord Alexander P.P. VI was an old man of an\r\nobese habit of body, Who had died of a fever in the height of summer, in\r\na most unwholesome quarter of the City, and at a time when antiseptic\r\ntreatment was unknown.\r\n\r\nThe Notary of Orvieto, on his return from Rome four days later, publicly\r\ndescribed to his municipality all that he had seen of the _novendiali_;\r\nand added that he had kissed the feet of His Holiness in St.\r\nPeter’s[62]: but said nothing of any hideous or monstrous appearance of\r\nthe corpse.\r\n\r\nSoon after death, a rumour was heard to the effect that the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI and Duke Cesare de Valentinois della Romagna had died\r\nenvenomed.\r\n\r\nFor three months it was only a rumour. A new Pope was elected—Cardinal\r\nFrancesco de’ Piccolhuomini of Siena, who took the name of the Lord Pius\r\nP.P. III out of respect to His Uncle, the Lord Pius P.P. II,[63]—and was\r\ndead after a two months’ reign.\r\n\r\nThen Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, irreconcileable enemy of Borgia,\r\nattained the object of his ambition; and was elected Pope by the name of\r\nthe Lord Julius P.P. II. And then the rumour took a concrete form.\r\n\r\nOn the tenth of November it definitely was said that, at the\r\ngarden-supper of the fifth of August venom had been put into some wine\r\nby order of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI; that by a butler’s blunder that\r\nenvenomed wine had been served to the Pope’s Holiness and to Duke\r\nCesare: that the former being old had died therefrom; that the latter\r\nbeing young had endured heroic treatment for a cure. Some said that he\r\nhad been plunged into the ripped-up belly of a live mule or bull amid\r\nthe steaming palpitating entrails profusely to sweat the venom out of\r\nhim: others, that he had been dipped in iced-water, and so cured.\r\n\r\nWriting several years later, Messer Francesco Guicciardini and Messer\r\nPaolo Giovio added new details. Guicciardini definitely settled the\r\nfalsehood in the form in which it generally appears. He gave a list of\r\ncardinals, also, and prelates who were to have been envenomed by the\r\nLord Alexander P.P. VI that He might inherit their wealth. Giovio named\r\nand described the venom which, he said, the Borgia commonly used. He\r\ncalled it _Cantarella_[64]; and said it was a sugared powder, or a\r\npowder under the guise of sugar, which was of a wonderful whiteness, and\r\nof a rather pleasant taste. It did not overwhelm the vital forces in the\r\nmanner of the active venoms by sudden and energetic action: but, by\r\npenetrating insensibly the veins, it slowly worked with mortal effect.\r\n(Paolo Giovio, Hist. II. 47. VIII. 205.) Is there any toxicological\r\nchymist who from this description can give the formula of this\r\nextraordinary venom?\r\n\r\nThe testimony of these two men is tainted. Messer Francesco\r\nGuicciardini, who wrote long after the event and solely from hearsay,\r\nwas a Florentine. Whatever is, and was, of Florence, is cultured,\r\npedantic, artificial, in the highest degree: whatever is, and was, of\r\nRome, is nakedly natural, original, free, and absolute, in the highest\r\ndegree. It was, and is, a habit of mind in the Florentine to decry Rome\r\nand all things Roman. Politically, Messer Francesco Guicciardini was an\r\nadherent of the House of Medici; and Medici were naturally the mortal\r\nfoes of Borgia, seeing that Borgia had acquiesced in and profited by\r\ntheir expulsion from Florence. And he was in the pay of the Roman\r\nColonna, who were Ghibelline by inherited tradition, _i.e._, upholders\r\nof the imperial against the papal prerogative. He was born in 1482; and\r\nwas of the age of twenty-one years at the death of the Lord Alexander\r\nP.P. VI. In 1530, having exhorted the Lord Clement P.P. VII to punish\r\nFlorence for insults which he (Guicciardini) had received in 1527, he\r\nturned traitor against the Medici, writing invectives against them till\r\nhis death in 1540. He divinely wrote at all times a sonorous and courtly\r\nTuscan, which makes his reader believe that one who could write so\r\nexquisitely must needs write truly. Yet he did not hesitate to boast\r\nthat he had a pen of gold for his friends, and a pen of iron for his\r\nfoes. Regretfully then it must be said that Messer Francesco\r\nGuicciardini does not deserve belief unless his statements can be\r\ncorroborated.\r\n\r\nTouching the matter of the Borgia venom, and especially of the\r\nenvenoming of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI and Duke Cesare, he is\r\ncorroborated by Messer Paolo Giovio.\r\n\r\nMesser Paolo Giovio was born in 1483, and was of the age of twenty years\r\nat the death of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI. He issued no books till\r\ntwenty-one years later. His first was a quoad-scientific treatise on\r\nRoman Fishes (_De Piscibus Romanis_), published in 1524. He was a\r\n_dilettante_ of a kind. He practised amniomancy, or the art of\r\ndivination by inspection of the membrane, Amnios, in which the unborn\r\nchild is wrapped—fantastic effort of a seeker after Truth. He was one of\r\nthose double-faced historians, who wrote one set of memoirs for the\r\nhighest bidder; (Popes whom they despised, Dukes whom they privately\r\nreviled,) and a second set of memoirs for the enemies of the patrons of\r\nthe first. His Life of the Lord Leo P.P. X (Giovanni de’ Medici) is a\r\nspecimen. Even during his life, he was considered to be a flagrant liar.\r\nHe used to say, with a dog-like knowledge of his masters the “people”\r\nwho “desire to be deceived,” that the centuries would give his written\r\nlies the force of truth. He used an affected and flamboyant rather than\r\na pure style; and was the inferior of Guicciardini. The Lord Clement\r\nP.P. VII (Giulio de’ Medici), to be rid of his incessant importunity,\r\ngave him the bishopric of Nocera; and he died in 1552.\r\n\r\nWho, therefore, wishes to believe Messer Francesco Guicciardini\r\nuncorroborated, or corroborated by Messer Paolo Giovio, will do so on\r\nhis own responsibility.\r\n\r\nLet it be noted that both Giovio and Guicciardini were Roman Catholics.\r\nTheir calumnies against the Lord Alexander P.P. VI are their own; and\r\nwere not invented by dissenters from their creed. The said calumnies\r\nvery naturally have been adopted by these last as articles of faith; and\r\nrepeated usque ad nauseam; or resented, with the most unconvincing and\r\ninane half-heartedness, by a majority of modern and soi-disant\r\nenlightened Roman Catholics, who fear (positively they shew every sign\r\nof fear) to credit their own learned clergy of the present day,\r\nLeonetti, Velron, Cerri, and Ollivier, to say nothing of the laity,\r\n_e.g._, Comte Réné de Maricourt, who have laboured for justice to the\r\nmaligned Borgia. Will these astonishingly inconsistent persons prefer to\r\nbelieve the opinion of an atheist, who was incidentally a man of common\r\nsense? It is Voltaire who, in speaking of Guicciardini’s statement,\r\n(that the Lord Alexander P.P. VI was the victim of venom which He had\r\nset for his cardinals, that, having killed them, He might take their\r\ntreasure,) says,\r\n\r\n  “All the enemies of the Holy See have welcomed this horrible anecdote.\r\n  I myself do not believe it at all; and my chief reason lies in its\r\n  extreme improbability. It is evident that the envenoming of a dozen\r\n  cardinals at supper would have caused the Father and the son[65] to\r\n  become so execrable, that nothing could have saved them from the fury\r\n  of the Roman people, and of the whole of Italy. Such a crime never\r\n  could have been concealed. Even supposing that it had not been avenged\r\n  by all Italy leagued together, it was directly contrary to the\r\n  interests of Cesare (detto) Borgia. The Pope was on the verge of the\r\n  grave. The Borgia faction was powerful enough to elect one of its own\r\n  creatures: was it likely that the votes of cardinals would be gained\r\n  by envenoming a dozen of them? I make bold to say to Guicciardini,\r\n  ‘Europe has been deceived by you, and you have been deceived by your\r\n  feelings. You were the enemy of the Pope; you have followed the advice\r\n  of your hatred. It is true that He had used vengeance cruel and\r\n  perfidious, against foes perfidious and cruel as Himself. Hence you\r\n  conclude that a Pope of the age of seventy-two years could not die a\r\n  natural death. You maintain, on vague rumour, that an aged sovereign,\r\n  whose coffers at that time contained more than a million of gold\r\n  ducats,[66] desired to envenom several cardinals that He might seize\r\n  their treasures. But were these treasures so important? The treasures\r\n  of cardinals nearly always were removed by their gentlemen before the\r\n  Popes could seize them. Why do you think that so prudent a Pope cared\r\n  to risk the doing of so very infamous a deed for so very small a gain;\r\n  a deed that could not be done without accomplices; and that sooner or\r\n  later must have been discovered? May I not trust the official accounts\r\n  of the Pope’s sickness, more than the mere rumours of the mob? That\r\n  official account declares the Pope to have died of a double-tertian\r\n  fever. There is not the slightest vestige of proof in favour of the\r\n  accusation which you have brought against His memory. His son\r\n  Borgia[67] happened to fall sick at the time when his Father died.\r\n  That is the sole foundation for the story of the venom.’”\r\n\r\nIt will appear that the death of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, from venom,\r\nis improbable. It may also be said that it was impossible, for reasons\r\nhere forthcoming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     The Legend of the Borgia Venom\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the stock phrases used by biographers and historians of the\r\nFifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries was “he (or she)—died in the odour of\r\nsanctity.” Another was “he (or she)—died not without suspicion of\r\nvenom.” Both phrases are the merest expression of private opinion, the\r\nimportance of which depends upon the integrity and knowledge of the\r\nuser: but in no case do they amount to a dogmatic, final, infallible, or\r\nauthoritative, decision.\r\n\r\nWhen a person is said to have departed this life in the odour of\r\nsanctity, (a purely technical phrase, insusceptible of literal\r\ntranslation,) sooner or later the process of ecclesiastical law is begun\r\nfor obtaining for the deceased the successive titles, _Venerable Servant\r\nof God_, _the Blessed ——_, and _Saint ——_. These titles, only being\r\nconferred after stringent examination of quality lasting many years and\r\nsometimes many centuries,[68] are taken to prove the pious opinion “died\r\nin the odour of sanctity” to have been founded on a verity.\r\n\r\nBut when a person is said to have died “not without suspicion of venom,”\r\nit is very rarely that steps are taken, juridically to examine that\r\nsuspicion with a view to proving it to be founded on fact or falsehood.\r\nThe world deliberately prefers to believe the worst of man, deliberately\r\nprefers suspicion. The expression in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth\r\nCenturies was as randomly and as inconsequently used as the cry for a\r\nGeneral Council, by every one who found occasion to go “against the\r\ngovernment”; and it certainly does not command respect by reason of its\r\nabsurdly frequent repetition. It was the fashion for their enemies to\r\naccuse the Borgia of compassing the death of some by venom. It was also\r\nthe fashion for the Borgia to retort upon their enemies in the same\r\nformula. There can be no human doubt that the Borgia and their enemies\r\nwould have envenomed each the other, had they known how to do so with\r\nsecurity and certainty. It was a habit of the Latin Races to see no\r\ndistinction between venom and steel when the idea was to get rid of a\r\nfoe. Cold northern nations, the English in particular, always have had a\r\nhorror of venom, preferring boots, fists, bullet, or blade; indeed one\r\nof the most hideous penances ordained by English and Post-Reformation\r\nlaw was awarded to criminals who had envenomed the lieges. They were\r\nboiled alive. “This year, the XVII March, was boyled in Smithfield one\r\nMargaret Davis, a maiden which had poisoned three households that she\r\ndwelled in.” (Wriothesley’s Chronicle, 1542.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps to this habit, of regarding the use of venom as so horrible a\r\ncrime, is due the fascination which those, who are supposed to have\r\nattained high eminence in its practice, have for Englishmen.\r\nUndoubtedly, Lord Alexander P.P. VI and Duke Cesare de Valentinois della\r\nRomagna are regarded as having been artists in venom, possessing\r\nknowledge far surpassing that of modern alchymists. They are believed to\r\nhave envenomed their foes, named and unnamed, by the score; and, at\r\nlast, to have fallen into the pit that they have digged for others.\r\n\r\nOf the cases named, Cardinal Giovanni Borgia (detto Giuniore), the\r\nSultan Djim, and Cardinal Orsini, are the most important. The\r\nimprobability in the case of the first already has been shewn: Duke\r\nCesare and he were friendly; their interests were asymptotic; and they\r\nwere apart during the seventeen days before the cardinal died. The\r\nimprobability in the case of the Sultan Djim lies in the fact that the\r\nPope lost 40,000 ducats annually, and the only means of keeping the\r\nTurks from Christendom, by his death which was due to natural causes,\r\nand took place when he was in the hands of the Christian King Charles\r\nVIII at Naples, some weeks after he had left Rome. The improbability in\r\nthe case of Cardinal Orsini is proved by the tainted source from which\r\nthe charge emanated; by the publicity of all proceedings before and\r\nafter his death; and by the sworn testimony of his leeches. Cases of\r\nthis kind must be considered together; and rejected or accepted\r\ntogether; for rumours do not gain credibility from vociferous\r\nrepetition: nor does it avail to plead that because advantages accrue\r\nfrom the death of such a one, therefore, the person benefited by the\r\ndeath is likely to have envenomed the deceased. Death is always\r\nadvantageous to some one living: but in no case named did the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI and Duke Cesare reap any gain whatever, but\r\ncontrariwise loss. As for the statement, that the venom of the Borgia\r\nwas a slow venom, slow in action, dirigible in absence, it safely may be\r\nsaid that no such venom existed then any more than it does now.\r\n\r\nThis slow venom is an invention of purveyors of a certain class of\r\nfiction, doing vast credit to their imaginative powers, but possessing\r\nno tangible existence. These writers of fiction are merchants who must\r\nsupply their customers with goods upon demand. The Legend of the Borgia\r\nVenom is a department of their trade. The public has read it and cried\r\nfor more according to the sample. The public is pleased to amuse itself.\r\nAt other times the public has the humour to inform itself; and takes\r\nspiritual pastors, and masters, cunning in all learning, in all verities\r\nof past and present. From these, the truth is required for mental\r\nprofit; from the others invention and imagination for mental recreation.\r\nThe public pays and has the right to choose what it will buy. A grocer,\r\nwho would venture to supply pickles instead of pepper ordered, would\r\nencounter his patron’s discontent. A teacher, who would venture to\r\npurvey fiction instead of fact required, would meet with similar\r\ndisaster, one would think. But in sober earnest, the Legend of the\r\nBorgia Venom so very industriously has been propagated, that modern\r\nserious writers have adopted it as one of the items which safely may be\r\nincluded in their serious writings: and the public finding it there, in\r\nplaces where truth is expected to be, looks upon the false as true\r\nbecause it comes with the imprimatur of authority.\r\n\r\nHerr Eugene Burckhardt’s very learned modern work, _The Civilization of\r\nthe Renaissance in Italy_, of which an English Translation is\r\naccessible, is a case in point. It purports to be gravely written, and\r\nis a mine of accurate information. Yet, among continuous ropes of pearls\r\nof wisdom, occasionally one is startled by the discovery of a bead so\r\nbase, that one wonders how it has escaped detection and damnation. Here\r\nis an example,\r\n\r\n  “Strictly speaking, as we are now discussing phases of Italian\r\n  civilization, this pontificate (1492–1503) might be passed over, since\r\n  the Borgia are no more Italian than the House of Naples. Alexander\r\n  spoke Spanish in public with Caesar; Lucrezia at her entry into\r\n  Ferrara, where she wore a Spanish costume, was sung to by Spanish\r\n  Buffoons: their confidential servants consisted of Spaniards, as did\r\n  most of the ill-famed company of the troops of Caesar in the war of\r\n  1500; and even his Hangman Don Michelotto, _and his Poisoner Sebastian\r\n  Pinzon_, seem to have been of the same nation.”\r\n\r\nThat is a specimen of the slipshod way in which serious writers are\r\nfalse to their trust, of the half-truths which they make to serve for\r\nthe truth about the Borgia. It is exceedingly necessary to lay great\r\nstress upon the Spanish origin of the Borgia, lest odium undeserved\r\nshould light on their adopted country Italy. They were very fine\r\nexamples of their race: but never let it be forgotten that their vices,\r\n(for, being men, they had their vices) were Spanish and not Italian\r\nvices. Herr Burckhardt does well to emphasize this fact, and to enrich\r\nand illuminate it with a wealth of illustration: but when he comes to\r\nspeak of Don Michelotto as Duke Cesare’s Hangman, and of Sebastian\r\nPinzon as his Poisoner, with the light and easy freedom which one uses\r\nin speaking of “the unquestioned things that are”; then one is compelled\r\nto conjure up the horrible and fantastic picture of the Generalissimo of\r\nthe Pontifical Army stalking about the continent of Europe with an\r\nofficial Hangman and an official Poisoner in his entourage. Don\r\nMichelotto was a captain of Duke Cesare’s condottieri, a valued\r\nconfidential servant, perhaps, on sudden occasion, as at Sinigaglia, his\r\n_executeur des hautes œuvres_: but never a professional Hangman. And\r\nSebastian Pinzon? Is it to be believed that Duke Cesare—for this really\r\nis what Herr Burckhardt’s amazing statement implies—did so much\r\nvenenation in the way of business, that it was as necessary to have a\r\nLord High Poisoner attached to his staff as a Groom of the Stola or a\r\nClerk of the Hanaper?[69] The thing is absurd; worthy of comic opera,\r\nnot of serious history. But the origin of Herr Burckhardt’s error shall\r\nbe traced.\r\n\r\nGiustiniani the Orator of Venice, to whom the Borgia were intensely\r\nantipathetic, and who neglected no opportunity of relating rumours\r\ndetrimental to them, sent to his government a dispatch dated the\r\ntwentieth of July 1502, stating, that the Most Illustrious Lord\r\nGiambattista Ferrari, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San Crisogono,\r\nvulgarly called the Cardinal of Modena, had died; that, in accordance\r\nwith his testament, his goods and benefices had been distributed; that\r\nhis archbishopric of Capua had been given to the young and lusty Lord\r\nCardinal Prince Ippolito d’Este (now of the age of twenty-four years and\r\na person of fashion;) that his bishopric of Modena had been given to his\r\nbrother; that the greater part of his goods had been given to his\r\nsecretary Messer Sebastiano Pinzoni; that this last bequest was called\r\n“the price of blood” for the secretary had envenomed his master, to have\r\nhis goods; that the Pope had endowed the said secretary with a canonry\r\nin Padua, the prefecture of Sant’ Agata in Cremona, a benefice in Rome,\r\nanother in Mantua valued at five hundred ducats, and had received him\r\n_inter familiares_.\r\n\r\nNow there is no word in that dispatch which implicates Duke Cesare. We\r\nlearn that Messer Sebastiano Pinzoni, secretary to the Cardinal of\r\nModena, was said, by rumour, to have envenomed his master in order to\r\nprofit thereby; and also that the said secretary had been patronised by\r\nthe Lord Alexander P.P. VI. That is all. It would be unpleasant to think\r\nof the Pope’s Holiness as the patron of a murderer: yet that would be\r\nthe obvious conclusion, if the matter ended here. But it does not. There\r\nis further record of Messer Sebastiano Pinzoni, which makes it clear\r\nthat his crime at first was unknown to the Pope; and that on its\r\ndiscovery he was forced to take refuge in flight. It is Monsignor\r\nBurchard who records in his Diarum under date Wednesday the twentieth of\r\nNovember 1504, that the Ruota (the supreme secular tribunal of the Holy\r\nRoman Church) delivered sentence against Sebastiano Pinzoni, Apostolic\r\nScribe, who was contumacious and absent, depriving him of all benefices\r\nand offices, for that he had slain with venom the Lord Cardinal of\r\nModena his patron who had raised him from the dung-hill.[70] Ciacconi\r\nsays that the Cardinal of Modena was envenomed by Sebastiano Pinzoni,\r\nhis gentleman-of-the-bedchamber; who, being imprisoned on another charge\r\nin the reign of the Lord Leo P.P. X, when put to the Question, confessed\r\nthis crime, which he before had denied.\r\n\r\nLet it be admitted that Sebastiano Pinzoni envenomed his master, then.\r\nBut Herr Burckhardt brings no evidence to prove that he was connected\r\nwith Duke Cesare; nor is it established that he was employed by His\r\nExcellency in any capacity, private, or official. But every crime of\r\nevery criminal in the Borgian Era is attributed to Borgia as a matter of\r\ncourse; and Herr Burckhardt, writing serious history, introduces\r\nfiction, and passes off Sebastiano Pinzoni as Duke Cesare’s Poisoner!\r\n\r\nTo turn from the historian to the novelist will afford a little\r\nrecreation in this quest of the Venom of the Borgia; and, also, the\r\ndiversion will not be unprofitable: for the novelist is an exceedingly\r\nimportant person by reason that he commands an infinitely wider audience\r\nthan the historian, and influences, forms, or moulds, an infinitely\r\nlarger section of opinion. M. Alexandre Dumas in his Crimes Célèbres has\r\nmuch to say about the Borgia. Knowing, as a practised hand, that the\r\nbest fiction is that which has a substratum of fact and an air of truth,\r\nM. Dumas quotes the precious Messer Paolo Giovio and his _Cantarella_\r\nwhich already has been mentioned here. Further, with a wealth of\r\n“corroborative detail calculated to give verisimilitude to an otherwise\r\nbald and unconvincing narrative,” he describes the preparation of a\r\nliquid venom which, he says, the Borgia used. A bear was caught and made\r\nto swallow a strong dose of arsenic. When this began to take effect, the\r\nbear was suspended by his hind-legs head-downward; and incontinent he\r\nwould fall into convulsions, while from his throat there poured a\r\ncopious deadly stream of foam, which was collected on a silver plate,\r\nbottled in vials hermetically sealed; and this was the liquid Venom of\r\nthe Borgia.\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of bears in the Apennines, perhaps, even in the Alban\r\nHills within twenty miles of Rome; so the bear is probable enough.\r\nHaving caught his bear, Duke Cesare would convey him to the Vatican—a\r\nlarge palace truly, but rather too full of people to be desirable as a\r\nprivate venom-factory. On a dark night in a lonely courtyard, the Pope’s\r\nHoliness and the Duke’s Excellency would administer the arsenic to the\r\nbear. The method of administration is not described, nor the slinging up\r\nof the beast prior to his convulsions, nor the picture of the aged\r\nPontiff skipping round with the silver plate in His solicitude that no\r\ndrop of the fluid should be lost, nor the solemn bottling of the vials,\r\nnor their hermetic sealing with what seal? The Ring of the Fisherman?\r\nAnd M. Dumas carefully omits to say that the nasty mess so secretly and\r\narduously obtained would have been far less venomous than the original\r\ndose of arsenic; which, administered neat, without the intervention of\r\nan ill-used bear, certainly would have slain: but which would be\r\ndeprived of most, if not of all, of its venomous potency, by its\r\nsubmission to the digestive processes of M. Dumas’ improbable and\r\nimpossible bear.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, there were the same venomous substances in and on this\r\nearth in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries, as there are now: some\r\nfew were known; but many more, and these the most sure and deadly, were\r\nnot even dreamed of, _e.g._, strychnine, prussic acid, or the hideous\r\nbacilli, accessible as dust to any Twentieth Century medico who, on the\r\nsole condition that he is not instigated by criminal motives, with\r\nperfect security to himself can envenom and slay a street, a district,\r\nor a city. In the year 1164, Abd-el-Mumin-ben-Ali the Moorish King of\r\nSpain chased from his dominions all Jews and Christians who refused the\r\nfaith of Islam. Among these, to Egypt went the celebrated Moses\r\nben-Maimon. All that was known, he knew; and he knew sixteen venoms;\r\nlitharge, verdigris, opium, arsenic, spurge or milk-wort, cashew-nut,\r\nhemlock, henbane, stramonium or thorn-apple, hemp, mandrake, venomous\r\nfungi, plantain, black-nightshade or felon-wort, belladonna, and\r\ncantharides. To these, were added in the Borgian Era four centuries\r\nlater, the tri-sulphite of arsenic, orpiment, antimony, corrosive\r\nsublimate, aconite or wolfsbane or monkshood, and perhaps white\r\nhellebore, and black or Christmas-Rose; making two and twenty substances\r\nknown to be venomous.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, much damage might be done with this arsenal of venoms: but\r\nonly in the event of the existence of the will to use them, and of the\r\nknowledge of the method of their exhibition.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, there was the will. The fact that Madonna Caterina\r\nSforza-Riario (author of a wonderful collection of recipes, domestic and\r\nmedicinal, a good housewife as well as witch and warrior,) was said to\r\nhave attempted the envenoming of the Pope’s Holiness, as described in\r\nBook II, speaks for the fact that venom was feared, and therefore likely\r\nto be used. Governments experimented with venoms: for what purpose, who\r\ncan tell? M. Lamanshy published an interesting document dated 1432 which\r\nhe found in the Venetian Secret Archives.[71] “Trial has been made, on\r\nthree porcine animals, of certain venoms, found in the chancery, sent\r\nvery long ago from Vicenza, which have been proved not to be good.”\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, there was the will. Undoubtedly, also, there was not the\r\nability.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStrange and paradoxical though it may seem to be, alchymical knowledge,\r\nalchymical art, was in a lower condition during the years succeeding the\r\nRenascence of Learning, than it had been in the Middle Ages, the\r\nso-called Dark Ages, which had gone before. The Dark Ages were the ages\r\nof Simples. The Age of the Renascence was the age of Compounds. And, in\r\nthose compounds, virtue was changed, or lost, by sublimation, by\r\ndistillation, or annulled by heterogeneous admixture. The following will\r\nmake this plain.\r\n\r\nIn the Dark Ages, medicaments were made from single herbs exhibited in\r\nthe form of draughts, poultices, lotions, or unguents. The old herbaries\r\nof Dioskorides, or of Appulejus, were used as text-books; and a few\r\nextracts from these will be curious, perhaps valuable, certainly a help\r\nto understanding.\r\n\r\n  (α) The herb Betony or Bishopwort (_Betonica officinalis_) must be\r\n        gathered in August without the help of iron, the mould shaken\r\n        from the roots, and dried in the shade. When triturated, two\r\n        drachms of it, mixed with hot beer or wine or honey, is an\r\n        antidote to venom, a digestive, a cure for hydrophobia,\r\n        constipation, toothache, and prevents monstrous nocturnal\r\n        visitors, or frightful sights and dreams. A lotion, made from\r\n        the herb seethed in fresh water till two-thirds are evaporated,\r\n        cures broken-head, epistaxis, fatigue, and rupture; or the\r\n        leaves may be used as a poultice. (As a matter of fact, Betony\r\n        is intoxicating, emetic, and purgative.)\r\n\r\n  (β) The herb Vervain or Ashthroat (_Verbena officinalis_) must be\r\n        pounded as a poultice for wounds and carbuncles. It is an\r\n        antidote to all venoms, and dogs may not bark at him who bears\r\n        it.\r\n\r\n  (γ) The herb Clovewort (_Ranunculus acris_), wreathed with red thread\r\n        on the neck during the waning of the April or October moon,\r\n        cures lunacy.\r\n\r\n  (δ) The herb Mugwort (_Artemisia dracunculus_), pounded to an unguent\r\n        with well-boiled olive-oil, will make strained sinews supple.\r\n        (This is excellent.)\r\n\r\n  (ε) The herb Ravensleek (_Orchis_, Σατύριον) will cure sore eyes when\r\n        they are smeared with its juice.\r\n\r\n  (ζ) The herb Watercress (_Nasturtium officinale_) will with its juice\r\n        stop hair from falling.\r\n\r\n  (η) The herb Madder (_Rubia tinctoria_) as a poultice cures sciatica.\r\n\r\n  (θ) The herb Clover (_Trifolium pratense_) prevents him who carries it\r\n        from suffering sore jaws.\r\n\r\n  (ι) The herb Rosemary (_Rosmarinus officinalis_) is good for the\r\n        teeth.\r\n\r\n  (κ) The herb Rue (_Ruta graveolens_), eaten green is an antifat; a\r\n        twig stops nose-bleeding; macerated in vinegar and soused on the\r\n        brow induces forgetfulness. Recommended for priests who wish to\r\n        observe their vow of continence.\r\n\r\n  (λ) The herb Dwarfdwostle or Pennyroyal (_Mentha pulegium_), as\r\n        unguent, cures sea-sickness; as a salve, or burned as incense,\r\n        cures fever and bellyache.\r\n\r\n  (μ) The herb Sage (_Salvia_), as a lotion, cures itch.\r\n\r\n  (ν) The herb Marjoram (_Origanum vulgare_), steeped in vinegar, cures\r\n        headache, or may be chewed for a cough.\r\n\r\n  (ξ) The herb Foxglove (_Digitalis purpurea_), as a poultice, cures\r\n        sores and pimples, ἕρπης. (Its venomous principle appears to be\r\n        unknown.)\r\n\r\n  (ο) The herb Wildthyme or Shepherdspurse (_Thymus campestris_) will\r\n        remove all inward foulness by the drinking of its ooze.\r\n\r\n  (π) The herb Violet (_Viola odorata_), made into an unguent with lard\r\n        or honey, cures wounds.\r\n\r\n  (ρ) The herb Wildgourd (_Cucumis colocynthus_, κολοκύνθος ἀγρía), its\r\n        inward neshness pounded in lithe beer without the churnels, will\r\n        stir the inward.\r\n\r\nThose are Simples, _i.e._, medicaments derived from single herbs, easily\r\ncome-by, within the reach of all; suited to a simple, but by no means\r\nsilly, race of men content with simple things, gifted with faith and\r\nsense, and unconcerned to dive below the surface and explore, or\r\nexperiment with, nature’s sacrosanct arcana.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Renascence of Learning, when the works of ancient writers were\r\nrediscovered, devoured, put in practice, filled men’s minds with new\r\nideas, and completely changed their point of view.\r\n\r\n_The Most Salubrious Precepts of Medicine_ written by Quintus Serenus\r\nSermonicus in the Third Century; the Thirty Seven Books of _Natural\r\nHistory_ by C. Plinius Secundus (Pliny Senior) which first saw light in\r\nA.D. 77; the eighty-three _Treatises_ of Claudius Galenus, (A.D.\r\n130–200); the thirty-four chapters of the _Animal Medicaments_ which\r\nSextus Placitus wrote in the Fourth Century after the Incarnation; the\r\neight books of Alexandros of Tralles in Lydia, _On Medicine_, first\r\ngiven to the world in the Sixth Century;—these were the keys that opened\r\nthe door of speculation to the alert and eager men of the Fifteenth\r\nCentury, already intoxicated by the glorious Discovery of Man.\r\n\r\nWeird and wonderful effects were produced by this flood of knowledge.\r\nWeird and wonderful were the new significances given to natural things,\r\nthe combinations of natural objects projected, the doctrines evolved\r\nfrom observation of natural phenomena. The study of nature became a\r\nsacred thing, reserved for the reverent and wise. Its followers were\r\ncalled magi, or magicians; their pursuit was magic. The magical art was\r\neither white or black, for the good or ill of men. Great and holy\r\npersonages practised white magic: the black was damned by the Church,\r\nand the bare suspicion of its practice sufficed to burn. The Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI distinguished Himself by His severity to the black\r\nmagi. White magic included the art of healing; divination by\r\ncheiromancy, amniomancy, lithomancy, astrology, and also experimented to\r\nfind out the hidden properties and virtues of all things strange, as\r\nwell as common. It was a vast field for research; and the men who walked\r\ntherein were just like boys, eager, sensible, ardent, inexperienced,\r\nready to assume and take for granted.\r\n\r\nA most eminent mage was Messer Eurico Cornelio Agrippa. During the\r\npontificate of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI he wrote his learning in a\r\nbook which he called _The Book of Occult Philosophy_. In the year 1510\r\nhe shewed his work to a friend, the celebrated Abbot Trithemius, who was\r\ncharmed with it, added to it, and advised Messer Eurico to impart it to\r\nthe elect alone. The advice apparently was taken; for the book was not\r\npublished till 1531. The mage largely dealt with kabbalistic writing,\r\ngiving various mysterious alphabets for use in magical recipes. He set\r\nforth the sigils planets and planet-signs of certain archangels, patrons\r\nof the days of the week, Michael, Gabriel, Samael, Raphael, Sachael,\r\nAnael, Cassiel, with their proper perfumes, red wheat, aloes, pepper,\r\nmastic, saffron, pepperwort, sulphur. He placed great importance on\r\ncharms and periapts or amulets.\r\n\r\n  “St. Thomas Aquinas,” he wrote, “that holy Doctor, in his Book _De\r\n  Fato_ saith that even Garments, Buildings, and other artificial Works\r\n  whatsoever, do receive a certain Qualification from the Stars: and\r\n  Magicians affirm that, not only by the Mixture and Application of\r\n  natural Things, but also in Images, Seals, Rings, Glasses, and some\r\n  other Instruments, being opportunely framed under a certain\r\n  Constellation, some celestial illustration may be taken, and some\r\n  wonderful thing may be received.”\r\n\r\nThis being his idea, it is not surprising to find him prescribing for\r\nthe reduction of an intermittent fever, the following charm of Quintus\r\nSerenus Sermonicus to be written on parchment and worn round the neck:\r\n\r\n                    a  b  r  a  c  a  d  a  b  r  a\r\n                    a  b  r  a  c  a  d  a  b  r\r\n                    a  b  r  a  c  a  d  a  b\r\n                    a  b  r  a  c  a  d  a\r\n                    a  b  r  a  c  a  d\r\n                    a  b  r  a  c  a\r\n                    a  b  r  a  c\r\n                    a  b  r  a\r\n                    a  b  r\r\n                    a  b\r\n                    a\r\n\r\nor, as a protection against evil spirits and dangers of journey, water,\r\nenemy, or arms, the beginning and end of the first five verses of\r\nGenesis:\r\n\r\n                              ‏בוווו‎––‏צמרכד‎‎\r\n\r\nwritten on virgin parchment, or on most pure gold, back and front, with\r\nan ink made of the smoke, of incense, or of consecrated wax tapers,\r\nmixed with holy water. This charm also must be worn round the neck, and\r\nits efficacy is conditional upon the belief of the wearer in God the\r\nCreator of All.\r\n\r\nMen of the Borgian Era knew that the tail of an ibex, dried with its\r\nflesh and skin and worn about the person, would ward off magic unless\r\nthe wearer should consent thereto. This they learned from St.\r\nHildegard’s treatise _De Animalibus_. They knew that the herb Heliotrope\r\nor Turnsole (_Heliotropion Europaeum_), placed under the pillow of a man\r\nwho has been robbed, will bring him a vision of the thief and his spoil;\r\nand that, when it was set up in a church, unfaithful wives would be\r\nunable to go away until it was removed. Their faith in the virtue of\r\ngems was very precious; and chiefly derived from the physician\r\nAlexandros of Tralles. A cockatrice engraved on green jasper preserved\r\nfrom the Evil Eye. A metal cross tied on the left arm cured epilepsy. A\r\nlive spider tied in a rag on the same arm cured ague. A metal ring,\r\nengraved with the sacred tau =Τ= (the “_Mark on the Forehead_”), also\r\nfreed from epilepsy. A ring, set with ass-hoof, cured ἀδυναμία. A ring,\r\ncarved with a council of ravens for Apollo, conferred conjugal joy and\r\nthe gift of clear-seeing. A brownish-yellow jacinth gave sleep. An\r\nagate, carved with St. John the Divine, protected from venom. Oriental\r\njasper or heliotrope (blood-stone), engraved with a youth wearing a\r\nnecklace of herbs, when anointed with marigold juice, conferred\r\ninvisibility. A copper ring, figured with a lion, a crescent, and a\r\nstar, and worn on the fourth finger, cured calculus. Amethyst kept the\r\nwearer sober, and a papal bull ordained it for episcopal rings. Coral\r\ndelivered from incubi and succubi. Herakles strangling the lion of\r\nNemea, carved on a honey-coloured sard, cured colic. Carnelian carved\r\nwith a Hermes Psuchopompos gave cheerfulness and courage. A man might\r\nlive as long as he liked if he looked at a presentment of St.\r\nChristopher (the Christian Herakles) every day.[72] The toad-stone or\r\nbufonite (the fossil palatal tooth of the ray-fish _Pycnodus_) when set\r\nin a ring was a most potent periapt against black magic. In the\r\nUniversity Galleries at Oxford, No. 691, there is a splendid specimen of\r\na double-toad-stone ring; _i.e._, the stones are set outward on opposite\r\nsides of the ring so that the one always touches the closed hand, while\r\nthe other is free to dismay a magical enemy.\r\n\r\nCheiromancy was expounded by Messer Andrea Corvo da Carpi, whose deeply\r\nreligious little treatise adorned with diagrams was published at Venice\r\nin 1500.\r\n\r\nBut the chief of the men of science of the Borgian Era was Messer\r\nGiambattista della Porta of Naples. Born in 1445, dying in 1515, he was\r\nan exact contemporary of Borgia. What he did not know of natural\r\nscience, no other man of his epoch knew. His house in Naples was a\r\nresort of literary and scientific men of every nation. He established\r\npublic and private academies of science in all directions, the chief of\r\nwhich were Gli Ozioni of Naples and one called Il Secreti which met in\r\nhis own house, and to which no mage was admitted unless he had made some\r\nnew and notable discovery of natural phenomena. This was the academy\r\nwhose name and air of mystery excited intense ecclesiastical suspicion\r\nat Rome, which by hinting at black magic procured the order to close the\r\nmeetings of the mages.\r\n\r\nMesser Giambattista della Porta was a copious writer. He gave to the\r\nworld a treatise On Physiognomy, in which he judges men’s characters by\r\ncomparing their faces to those of certain beasts; and a diffuse and\r\nlearned work on cyphers, De Occultis Literium Notis. His great work,\r\nhowever, was The Book of Natural Magic. He says that he began it in\r\n1460, when he barely was of the age of fifteen years;—these were the\r\nprecocious times when Messer Giovanni de Medici was a Lord Cardinal at\r\nthirteen and Prince Gioffredo Borgia of Squillace a married man and\r\ncaptain of condottieri at fourteen;—and thirty-five years later in 1495,\r\nby the help of that lusty young Maecenas the Lord Cardinal Prince\r\nIppolito d’Este, he published the matured work from which the following\r\nrecipes are taken.\r\n\r\nVery few English people realize the doctrine of Sympathy and Antipathy;\r\nor admit that Attraction and Repulsion are Primary Forces. “I do not\r\nlove thee, Doctor Fell, the reason why I cannot tell,” says the\r\nEnglishman, and worries to find that reason instead of recognising the\r\nLaw. “She is simpatica and he is antipaticissimo,” says an Italian,\r\nstating and admitting a natural law. Messer Giambattista della Porta is\r\nvery clear on the point of Antipathy, which he illustrates by saying\r\nthat Vine and Colewort are natural enemies, because Colewort cures\r\ndrunkenness; that Rue and Hemlock are natural enemies, because Hemlock\r\nheals blisters raised by Rue: as well as on the point of Sympathy which\r\nhe illustrates by saying that a wild bull, tethered to a fig-tree, will\r\nbecome tame and gentle; and a dog, laid to a diseased part of a man’s\r\nbody, will absorb the disease.\r\n\r\nHe says that beasts have knowledge all their own: that ravens use ivy,\r\neagles use maidenhair, herons use carrots, on their nests as natural\r\npreservatives against enchantments: that cats eat grass, and pigeons\r\npellitory, for their ailments: that lions with quartan agues eat apes,\r\nthat dim-eyed hawks eat sow-thistle, that serpents rejuvenate on fennel,\r\nand that partridges eat leeks to clear their voices.\r\n\r\nTo prove that he has not gone about the world with eyes closed, he\r\nremarks that mice are generated of putrefaction, frogs of rotten dust\r\nand rain, red toads of dirt and καταμήνια, and serpents of the hair of\r\nhorses’ manes or of a dead man’s back-marrow.\r\n\r\nHe advises the creation of new animals by crossbreeding; a hunting dog,\r\nof a mastiff and a lioness or tigress; a trick dog, of a bitch and an\r\nape; and birds with delicious flesh for gourmets, of a cock and a\r\npeahen, or of a cock pheasant and a plain hen. His method of making a\r\nbird sociable and friendly is quaint and unique. He says that, before\r\nthe creature has got its feathers, you must break off its lower beak\r\neven to the jaw. Then, having not the wherewithal to peck up food, it\r\nmust come to its master to be fed.\r\n\r\nHe advocates the creation of new fruits which sound most daintily, by\r\ngrafting a mulberry on a chestnut tree, a peach on a nut, a quince on a\r\npear, a citron on an apple, and a cherry on a bay. He advises the making\r\nof bread with dates and walnuts; and of wine with quinces.\r\n\r\nHe will make precious stones—a jacinth by putting lead into an earthen\r\npot, and setting it in a glass-maker’s furnace until the lead is\r\nvitrified: or an emerald by dissolving silver in aqua-fortis, casting in\r\nplates of copper to which the composition will adhere, drying the plates\r\nin the sun, setting them in an earthen pot for some days in a\r\nglass-maker’s furnace.\r\n\r\nHe says that green and merry dreams may be procured by eating balm, or\r\nbugloss, or bows of poplar; and black and melancholy dreams by eating\r\nbeans, lentils, onions, garlic, leeks.\r\n\r\nHe will cure toothache with roots of pellitory or of herbane, bruised.\r\nFor the care of the teeth he recommends a wash made of leaves of mastic,\r\nrosemary, sage, and bramble, macerated in Greek wine, (_i.e._, a strong\r\nrich wine grown in dry volcanic soil:) or a tooth-powder made of barley\r\nbread-crumbs browned with salt. But his recipe for white and pearly\r\nteeth is a master-piece.\r\n\r\n  “Take three handfuls each of flowers and leaves of sage, nettle,\r\n  rosemary, mallow, olive, plantain, and rind of walnut roots; two\r\n  handfuls each of rock-rose (κίστος), horehound, bramble-tops; a pound\r\n  of flower and half a pound of seed of myrtle; two handfuls of rose\r\n  buds; two drachms each of sandal-wood, coriander, and citron-pips;\r\n  three drachms of cinnamon; ten drachms of cypress nuts; five green\r\n  pine-cones; two drachms each of mastic and Armenian bole or clay.\r\n  Reduce all these to powder. Infuse them in sharp black wine. Macerate\r\n  them for three days. Slightly press out the wine. Put them in an\r\n  alembic and distil them on a gentle fire. Boil the distillation till\r\n  two ounces of alum is dissolved in it. Keep in a close-stopped vial:\r\n  and, for use, fill the mouth with the lotion, and rub the teeth with a\r\n  finger wrapped in fine linen.”\r\n\r\nAn excellent specimen this, of a Compound as distinguished from a\r\nSimple; of the sophistication, and of the meticulous personal\r\ncleanliness, of people of the Borgian Era.\r\n\r\nTo cure a man of Envy, says this mage, keep him in the fresh air, hang\r\ncarbuncles and jacinths and sapphires on his neck, let him wear a ring\r\nmade of ass-hoof and smell to hyssop and sweet lilies.\r\n\r\nMesser Giambattista Porta’s ninth Book teaches how to make women\r\nbeautiful. There was a fashion which continued the forehead to the\r\nmiddle of the skull; and a depilatory is recommended made of quicklime\r\nfour ounces, and orpiment two ounces, boiled until a hen’s feather\r\ndipped into it is bared. This frightful compound must not long remain on\r\nthe skin; and the burns should be dressed with the gum of aspen-bark\r\n(_Populus Tremula_) and oil of roses or of violets. Or, hair may be\r\nremoved by fomentation with hot water, plucking out with nippers one by\r\none, and anointing the holes with a saturated solution of saltpetre, or\r\nwith oil of brimstone or vitriol, the process being repeated once a\r\nyear. Where hair is only thin and downy, the roots of wild hyacinth\r\nrubbed on will keep it back.\r\n\r\nTo dye the hair yellow, (in imitation of Madonna Lucrezia Borgia, whose\r\nbeautiful yellow hair was much admired,) add enough honey to soften the\r\nlees of white wine and keep the hair wet with this all night. Then\r\nbruise roots of celandine and greater-clivers-madder, mix them with oil\r\nof cummin seed, box-shavings, and saffron; and keep this on the head for\r\nfour and twenty hours, when it should be washed off with a lye of\r\ncabbage-stalks and ashes of rye-straw.\r\n\r\nTo make the hair grow it should be washed in the liquid that first\r\ndistils from honey by the fire: or it should be anointed with an unguent\r\nmade of marsh-mallow bruised in hog’s grease, boiled long in wine, added\r\nto bruised cummin seed, mastic, yolk of egg, boiled again, and strained\r\nthrough linen.\r\n\r\nTo make hair thick and curly, boil maidenhair with smallage seed in wine\r\nand oil; or roots of daffydillies, or dwarf-elder, boiled with wine and\r\noil.\r\n\r\nWater, in which the bulbous tops of lilies have been boiled, makes the\r\nskin fair: and corrosive sublimate and cerusa (white lead) makes the\r\nface white and shining.\r\n\r\nFor sunburn, white of egg and sugar-candy on the face at night, washed\r\noff in barley-water in the morning, is prescribed: and a clear skin is\r\nto be had by rubbing with the rind or bruised seeds of melons. It will\r\nbe obvious that there were “plain” as well as “coloured” women in the\r\nBorgian Era; _i.e._, those who went about their duty (of cultivating\r\ntheir charms) in a wholesome way, and those who used violent and nasty\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nMesser Giambattista della Porta appears to have used his science and\r\nmagical art to invent “Some Sports against Women”; which will show what\r\nthe Borgian Era regarded as permissible practical jokes. He says that,\r\nif you wish to discover paint on a face, you must chew saffron before\r\nbreathing on her, and incontinently she yellows: or you may burn\r\nbrimstone near her, which will blacken mercury sublimate and cerusa\r\n(white lead): or you may chew cummin or garlic and breathe on her, and\r\nher cerusa or quicksilver will decay. But if that you yearn to dye a\r\nwoman green, you must decoct a chameleon in her bath.\r\n\r\nHis tenth book deals with interminable and elaborate processes of\r\ndistillation and sublimation; proving that what was said on a previous\r\npage concerning Letters and Art, (viz., that the habit of the time was\r\nto think all of the workmanship, and nothing of the material used,) was\r\nperfectly true of Fifteenth Century pharmacy also. These mages sat and\r\nboiled their alembics and crucibles; and distilled, and distilled, and\r\nsublimed, and sublimed, till the nature of their stuff was lost, or\r\nutterly changed, instead of being refined and concentrated as they\r\nvainly hoped. They were just like boys, eager, sensible, ardent,\r\ninexperienced. They made the inevitable blunders of adventurers. They\r\ncommitted the extravagances of human nature in unwonted circumstances;\r\nand the wisdom of the Twentieth Century is the fruit of the fooling of\r\nthe Fifteenth.\r\n\r\nMesser Giambattista della Porta devotes his eleventh book to Perfumes;\r\nhis twelfth to the making of Greek Fire (from camphor, pitch, spirits\r\nand brimstone) of gunpowder, and of rockets shells and mines; his\r\nthirteenth to the tempering of steel.\r\n\r\nHis fourteenth book contains monstrous and characteristic recipes\r\nconnected with meats and drinks. If you want to make your guests\r\ndrunken, mix with their wine the filth of a dog’s ear. If you prefer to\r\nmake them mad-drunk, give them a camel’s froth in water. If you want to\r\navoid being overcome of wine, eat leeks and saffron, wear garlands of\r\nroses, violets and ivy-berries, and carry an amethyst on your person. To\r\nkeep your boy sober, before he has tasted wine give him the boiled eggs\r\nof an owl, to temper his natural heat. If you want delicately to drive\r\nunwelcome guests from your table, you may disgust them with the viands\r\nin five ways: first, a needle which has sewed dead men’s shrouds when\r\nstuck under the table will cause all to loathe to eat: secondly, meat\r\nsecretly peppered with powdered root of wake-robin (_Arum maculatum_)\r\nwill fetch the skin off their mouths: thirdly, food sprinkled before\r\nserving with powdered leaves of cuckoo-pine (—_gen. Arum_) will produce\r\ncopious salivation: fourthly, knives and napkins rubbed with wildgourd\r\njuice (_Cucunis colocynthus_, κολοκύνθις ἀγρία) will give to all they\r\ntouch a horrible smack : lastly, harp-strings, cut small and strewed on\r\nhot meat, will writhe like worms; and so you may rid your table of\r\nunwelcome guests.\r\n\r\nIf you would bone a pigeon, draw, and soak in vinegar for four and\r\ntwenty hours; then pull out the bones, wash well, fill with herbs and\r\nspices and roast or boil it. To make tender a tough capon, boil it\r\nbefore roasting. But, if you desire to give your friends much joy,\r\nentertain them to a goose cooked alive. In the courtyard, pluck your\r\ngoose except her head and neck, and cover her with lard and suet. Build\r\na ring of faggots round her; not too narrow, lest she evade the\r\nroasting, nor too wide lest the smoke choke her, or the fire burn her.\r\nInside the ring of faggots, on the ground occupied by your plucked and\r\nlarded goose, place several pots of water mixed with salt and bearwort.\r\nLight the faggots slowly. When the goose begins to roast she will walk\r\nabout; but she cannot escape; and you have her wings. When she grows\r\nweary and very hot, she quenches her thirst with the medicated water,\r\nand cools her heart and her inward parts. You continually must moisten\r\nher head and her heart with a sponge at the end of a cane. At last, you\r\nwill see her run incontinently up and down; and presently stumble. Then\r\nshe is empty, and there is no more moisture in her heart. Wherefore you\r\nmay take her away, and set her on the table to your guests: she will cry\r\nwhen you pull off her pieces; and you almost may eat her before she has\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth and last book of Natural Magic treats of various modes of\r\nconducting secret correspondence by invisible inks, writing on eggs or\r\nnaked backs of drugged couriers, counterfeit seals and writing, messages\r\nby pigeon or by arrows.\r\n\r\nThose are the things of which a sober learned and most eminent physician\r\nof the Fifteenth Century seriously has written, and called Natural\r\nMagic. He shews the innocent ingenuous mind of a child rampant among new\r\ntoys.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving shewn something of this mage’s knowledge, it may be said, now,\r\nthat, scattered about his Book of Natural Magic, carelessly and\r\nincidentally, there are allusions to certain venoms. He says:\r\n\r\n    I. that ἐζάμβλωσις may be procured by exhibiting the wine that Pliny\r\n         calls Phthorium (Φθόριος) (Plin. 4, 16, 19, § 110), made from\r\n         the grapes of a vine on which hellebore, wildgourd, and scamony\r\n         have been grafted:\r\n\r\n   II. that Mandrakes (Μανδραγόρας), _Mandragora_ (_Atropa Officinalis_)\r\n         growing by a vine, will make its grapes hypnotic:\r\n\r\n  III. that one drachm of belladonna (—_gen. Atropa_) or stramonium\r\n         (thorn-apple, _Datura stramonium_) in water, (which they will\r\n         infect without taste or smell,) “will make men mad without any\r\n         hurt, so that it is a most pleasant spectacle to behold such\r\n         mad whimsies and visions. It is very pleasant to behold. Pray\r\n         make trial,” he lightly says. But he adds that one ounce of\r\n         these drugs will make a man sleep four days.\r\n\r\n   IV. that one drachm of Nightshade rind (_Solanum nigrum_) in wine\r\n         will give sleep; a little more, madness; a large dose, death:\r\n\r\n    V. that Hemlock (_Conium maculatum_) in wine will cause death:\r\n\r\n   VI. that the drachm dose of belladonna, bruised in wine, is good for\r\n         driving away unwelcome guests.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that three of these six prescriptions contemplate\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nMesser Giambattista della Porta emphatically states that no single venom\r\nwill kill all living creatures; “for what is venomous to one may serve\r\nfor the preservation of another, which comes not by reason of the\r\nquality but of the distinct nature.” He gives a lengthy list of\r\nsubstances with the animals to which they are fatal, _e.g._, wolfebane\r\nkills wolves; henbane, hens; daffydillies, mice; black hellebore, oxen;\r\nwhite hellebore, pigeons; ivy, bats; comfrey, eagles; pondweed, urchins;\r\nmustard-seed, larks; vine-juice, cranes; willow, tom-tits;\r\npomegranate-churnels, falcons, vultures, sea-gulls, blackbirds; and nux\r\nvomica, dogs. In regard to the last, it should be understood that the\r\nFifteenth Century called foxglove (_Digitalis purpurea_) nux vomica ;\r\nand had not succeeded in extracting the vegetable alkaloid Strychnine,\r\nin its modern isolated form, from the Javanese Στρύχνος _nux vomica_, of\r\nwhich it is the active principle.\r\n\r\nTo complete the exposition of this typical Fifteenth Century man of\r\nscience, his chief Antidote to Venom is appended here.\r\n\r\n  “Take three pounds of old oil and two handfuls of St. John’s Wort,\r\n  (Balm of the Warrior’s Wound, _hypericum_.) Macerate for two months in\r\n  the sun. Strain off the old flowers, and add two ounces of fresh. Boil\r\n  in Balneo Mariae (a bain-marie) for six hours. Put in a close-stopped\r\n  bottle and keep in the sun for fifteen days. During July, add three\r\n  ounces of St. John’s Wort seed which gently has been stamped and\r\n  steeped in two glasses of white wine for three days. Add also two\r\n  drachms each of gentian, tormentil, dittany, zedoary, and carline,\r\n  (all of which must have been gathered in August,) sandal-wood and\r\n  long-aristolochie. Gently boil for six hours in Balneo Mariae. Strain\r\n  in a press. Add to the expression one ounce each of saffron, myrrh,\r\n  aloes, spikenard, and rhubarb, all bruised. Boil for a day in Balneo\r\n  Mariae. Add two ounces each of treacle and mithridate. Boil for six\r\n  hours in Balneo Mariae. And set it in the sun for forty days.\r\n\r\n  “In plague, or suspicion of venom, anoint the stomach, wrists, and\r\n  heart; and drink three drops in wine. It will work wonders,” says\r\n  Messer Giambattista della Porta.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pharmacy of the Renascence, to quote the confession of the charlatan\r\nCagliostro, consisted _in herbs and words_, “in verbis et in herbis.”\r\n\r\nThe practice of medicine during the Borgian Era appears to have been\r\nentirely empirical. Physicians experimented on the vile body of their\r\npatient, trusting to luck, or chance, or faith, to work a cure. In\r\ncontracts it was expressly stated that physicians must have the\r\nreputation of being _fortunate_ (felix). Chirugeons were totally unaware\r\nof the circulation of the blood. So much stress here is laid upon the\r\nart and craft and mystery of medicine and its exponents, because from\r\nthese, and from these alone, the knowledge and use of venoms could be\r\nobtained; and, if the blind can lead the blind without both falling into\r\nthe same ditch, then there might be some foundation in fact for the\r\nlegend of the Borgia Venom. But while physicians and chirugeons and\r\napothecaries solemnly bought three little boys for a ducat each, drew\r\noff their blood and sublimed it into a potion to save the life of a\r\nsenile pontiff; or did such monkey-tricks as Messer Juan de Vigo did to\r\nthe Lord Julius P.P. II a few years later, all with quite convincing\r\nevidence of gravity and good faith, one must conclude that these mages\r\nacted according to the very best of their knowledge and belief; but\r\nthat, in quantity as well as quality, their belief was vastly superior\r\nto their knowledge. Nardaeus says[73]\r\n\r\n  “The famous chirugeon Juan de Vigo, perceiving that an ulcer of the\r\n  Lord Julius P.P. II became every day more stubborn, and that the Pope\r\n  persisted in refusing all manner of remedies, hit upon a new method of\r\n  cure: for he boiled together, in a brass kettle, for three hours, old\r\n  rags cut in pieces, crumbs of fine bread, plantain, and a fomentation\r\n  of arsenic sublimed in rosewater; after which, drying them, and\r\n  applying them by way of powder to the wound (to which he had sworn\r\n  that he would apply no more plaisters,) he cured the Pope in a very\r\n  short time, to the admiration of all concerned.”\r\n\r\nInfantile as was the condition of medical science in regard to life, it\r\nwas not one jot more robust in its observations of death. The cases of\r\nthe suspicious demises of two cardinals, not during the reign of the\r\nLord Alexander P.P. VI, but a few years later, will illustrate this.\r\n\r\nIn 1508, during the reign of the eternal enemy of Borgia the Lord Julius\r\nP.P. II, a nephew of His Holiness died, the Lord Galeotto Franciotto\r\ndella Rovere, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of San Pietro _ad\r\nVincula_. And, says Mgr. Paris de Grassis (Burchard’s inimical successor\r\nas Caerimonarius,[74] “I saw on his face and on his body such spots as\r\nseemed to be the effect of a dose of venom; and all the others formed\r\nthe same opinion.”\r\n\r\nAfter autopsy, the chirugeons found no venom, but “certain bloody spots:\r\nwherefore they judged him to have died of a superfluity of blood; and,\r\nif he had been phlebotomized, he would have had no harm.”\r\n\r\nThe second case is that of the Lord Christopher Bainbridge,\r\nCardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Prassede, and Orator of King\r\nHenry VII Tudor at the Court of the Lord Leo P.P. X. He died in Rome, in\r\n1514; and, says Mgr. Paris de Grassis the Caerimonarius, “when his death\r\nwas ascribed to venom” (—_this surely ought to prove that the suspicion\r\nwas habitual, and no more appropriate to the Borgia than to any other\r\nfamily of this period_,—) “by command of the Pope he was eviscerated,\r\nand it was found that his heart was diseased on the right side.”\r\n\r\nNow this Cardinal Bainbridge, whose death obviously was due to organic\r\ndisease, has come down to posterity as a victim of venom; while Cardinal\r\nDellarovere, whose _salma_ presented far more suspicious, in fact\r\ndistinctly suspicious, symptoms, is reputed to have died a natural\r\ndeath!\r\n\r\nOf all the wonderful and subtile recipes for venoms which are believed\r\nto have been possessed by European potentates about this time, only one\r\nnow is accessible: but it is dated 1540, exactly thirty-seven years\r\nafter the Lord Alexander P.P. VI died of his double-tertian fever. It is\r\na Venetian recipe, and comes from the Secret Archives of the Council of\r\nTen.[75] Arsenic, antimony, orpiment, and aconite, are to be subjected\r\nto a long long process of preparation, similar to those wondrous stews\r\nin which Messer Giambattista della Porta, in company with every other\r\nrespectable mage, had his continual joy; and, when all is done, the\r\nignorant inventor of this horrible venom says that he cannot guarantee\r\nits success. Why? The dose of any single one of those four venomous\r\ningredients alone would have been fatal. Why should their combination\r\nbring uncertainty? For the simple reason that the boiling and the\r\nsun-baking, the sublimation and the distillation, which so prolongedly\r\nwas practised, set up chemical change, reaction, decomposition,\r\ndestroyed the virtue or the nature, and effectually altered or annulled\r\nthe venomous properties originally possessed by the subject of so much\r\nempiricism. As simples, they certainly would have been veneficous. As\r\ncompounds, they might have caused grave inconvenience. But,\r\nheterogeneously compounded with alien matter, boiled to disintegration\r\nfor weeks and months together, their effect surely could not be\r\npredicted. They might have been dangerous; or they might not: there is\r\nno knowing.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is no defined charge against the House of Borgia of having\r\ncompassed their enemies’ deaths by means of venomous rings. The vulgar\r\nconception of a venomous ring is not unconnected with a needle-point,\r\n(or point,) projecting from the bezel, along which a minute drop of\r\ndeadly venom can be made to flow; and which pierces the hand that grasps\r\nit, inducing syncope and death. Or, another kind conceals a small box in\r\nthe bezel, containing a tiny capsule of glass wherein venom innocuously\r\nlurks, until the glass is broken on the lips.\r\n\r\nAt the Victoria and Albert Museum of South Kensington, and at the\r\nUniversity Galleries of Oxford, there are very splendid collections of\r\nrings. Neither collection contains a ring having the legendary\r\nneedle-point, (or point:) but each collection has a ring which may have\r\nbeen a proximate occasion of the vulgar belief.\r\n\r\nNº 916 at South Kensington is a massive ring of brass, 1⁷⁄₁₆ inches in\r\ndiameter; and has an octagonal bezel externally armed with a quincunx of\r\nspikes. It belongs to the Eighteenth Century, and is of the kind worn by\r\nBavarian peasant-lads on the right middle finger at the present day.\r\n\r\nNº 385 at Oxford is an Italian ring of the Fourteenth Century, of gold\r\n_niello_, very beautiful. The bezel projects, and ends in the revolving\r\nrowel of a Fiery spur.\r\n\r\nBoth of these rings are weapons, intended hideously to scratch and tear\r\nan adversary’s face. There is no hollow in them that might harbour\r\nvenom; and they are in no sense venomous rings according to the popular\r\nspecification: but they are rings,—means of violence of another\r\nspecies—; and, (men being what they are,) these rings may have formed\r\nthe germ of the tradition.\r\n\r\nHowever, at Oxford and South Kensington, there were rings labelled\r\n_Poison Rings_, at the close of the Nineteenth Century.\r\n\r\nNº 479 in the Fortnum Collection at Oxford, is an Italian ring of the\r\nSixteenth Century, of gold, and having a tiny χερούβ carved in cameo\r\nprojecting from the high gold bezel. This bezel is hollow, pierced by\r\ntwo pinholes. Its capacity is under an eighth of a cubic inch. The\r\nhollow bezel may have been used to contain perfume, introduced through\r\nthe pinholes: but it is more reasonable to conjecture that the hollow is\r\ndue to a desire to economise the precious metal.\r\n\r\nNº 533 in the same collection, is a German ring of the Seventeenth\r\nCentury, of gold, and having a large rough pearl set _in_, not on, its\r\nbezel. Minute examination with microscope and probe proves that there is\r\nabsolutely no room in this ring for any venom whatever; and that neither\r\nthis, nor the foregoing, deserves the designation “_Poison Ring_,”\r\nwhich, however, discreetly is queried on the actual official labels.\r\nApparently, the said labels purely are a concession to the unreasoning\r\nvulgar, who expect as a right to find at least a specimen of venomous\r\nrings in every respectable museum.\r\n\r\nAt South Kensington there is a massive ring of iron, plated and\r\ndamascened with gold. It is Italian, of the Seventeenth Century, ¹¹⁄₁₂\r\nof an inch in diameter. Its octagonal bezel is a tiny box having a\r\nhinged lid. This might have held a relic. There is no ground for\r\nsupposing that it ever concealed venom.\r\n\r\nOf these three so-called Poison Rings, the South Kensington specimen,\r\nand Nº 533 at Oxford, belong to a period at least a hundred years after\r\nthe demise of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI and Duke Cesare (detto Borgia).\r\nOnly Nº 479 in the Fortnum Collection, by any exercise of imagination,\r\ncan be planted in the Borgian Era. It is labelled “_Sixteenth Century_”;\r\nand the Lord Alexander P.P. VI reigned in Rome, as God’s Vicegerent,\r\nduring the first two years, seven months, seventeen days, of that\r\ncentury. There is no earthly cause to connect His Holiness with that\r\nring: but, for the purpose of the argument, let it be granted that Nº\r\n479 with its cameo χερούβ belonged to the Borgia Pontiff, that the\r\nhollow bezel was used as a receptacle for venom, and not for perfume.\r\nWhat then?\r\n\r\nIf the venom were a powder, the Pope’s Holiness would have to poke it in\r\nwith a pin, and close the two tiny holes with wax. Then, when the time\r\ncame for envenoming the usual cardinal, He assiduously would pick out\r\nthe wax, and, by violent jerks and shaking, induce the venom to present\r\nitself for application. If the venom were a liquid, (M. Dumas’\r\nbear-juice for example,) the same process of waxing up and pin-picking\r\nwould be necessary.\r\n\r\nBut there was no venom known to the Borgia, or to any other man or woman\r\nof that era, which would kill, with as small a dose as would go in that\r\nring. The venoms of the Fifteenth Century were administered (when they\r\nwere administered) by the drachm, or by the ounce—not by the grain. The\r\nrecipes have been displayed here. To harbour a fatal dose of the known\r\nvenoms, such as Messer Giambattista della Porta describes, a monstrous\r\nand vast ring would be needed, more gigantic than those bronze-gilt\r\n_anuli_ used as credentials by the pontifical couriers of the Lord Pius\r\nP.P. II (1458–1464), N^{os} 665 and 666 in the South Kensington\r\nCollection, two and three-eighths, and two inches, respectively, in\r\ndiameter. The processes of brewing and stewing, so dear to the mages,\r\nwithout any doubt were a direct disposition of Providence for the\r\nsecurity of human life; for they effectually withdrew the sting from\r\nvenomous substances, and made it perfectly impossible for would-be\r\nmurderers (and they were more than many) to kill, except accidentally,\r\nor with enormous doses and the disadvantages coincident thereto.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the Twentieth Century still has a little to learn. No doubt\r\nthat wisdom would wait upon research among the mountains of documents\r\nstored in the archives of the Italian patriciate and baronage, Colonna,\r\n(not Orsini, whose papers were destroyed by fire in 1702), Savelli,\r\nPoplicola di Santacroce, Sforza-Cesarini, Carafa, Caïetani,\r\nPiccolhuomini, Borgia of Milan and Velletri, etc. No doubt in the\r\nVatican Secret Archives (the Lord Alexander P.P. VI left one hundred and\r\nthirteen volumes in large folio of His acts,) infinite fields of\r\ninformation are white for harvest. There is nothing to prevent the\r\nreaping, but the lack of reapers. No doors are shut. No secrets are\r\nreserved. “The Popes have need of nothing except the truth.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, this only can be said.\r\n\r\nThe empirical methods of the Borgian Era preclude the possibility of\r\nanything approaching artistic venenation.\r\n\r\nNot one of the definite accusations against the Borgia have been proved.\r\nOn the contrary they are shewn to lack valid foundation.\r\n\r\nThere is no authentic evidence regarding the Venom that the Borgia are\r\nsaid to have employed.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there was no Venom of the Borgia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Pontifex Maximus Alexander VI et Princeps\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the Pontificate of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI notice must\r\nbe taken of the fashion which represents Him as having been in continual\r\nfear of deposition on account of the simony by which He is alleged to\r\nhave bought the papal power. It already has been shewn that no law\r\nexisted, which made simony an annulment of election to ecclesiastical\r\nbenefices, until the reign of the Lord Julius P.P. II. It remains to be\r\nconsidered whether the distribution of offices, with which the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI signalized his election, in any case would give colour\r\nto the charge of simony.\r\n\r\nThe Conclave for the election of a Pope begins with the Mass of the Holy\r\nSpirit chaunted in the Chapel of St. Gregory. Afterwards, the cardinals\r\ngo in procession, singing _Veni Creator Spiritus_, to take possession of\r\nthe cells which they will have to occupy. These cells are erected in a\r\nhall of the Vatican, communicating with the Xystine Chapel. They are\r\nmere frameworks of wood hung with fringed curtains of baize, green in\r\nthe cases of cardinals who are creatures of previous pontiffs; violet in\r\nthe cases of cardinals who are creatures of the pontiffs just deceased.\r\nOn the front of each cell is a curtained doorway over which the\r\narmorials of the occupant are shewn, surmounted by a little swinging\r\nwindow. Each cardinal has a bed, a table, and a chair. His attendants\r\nsupport life in discomfort as best they may. Three hours after\r\navemmaria, all doors and windows communicating with the outer world are\r\nwalled up. Guards on the outside watch every avenue of access, under\r\ncommand of the Hereditary Marshal of the Church, now Prince Chigi, then\r\nPrince Savelli. To every cardinal are allowed two conclavists for his\r\nattendants, a chaplain and an esquire. A cardinal-prince, or one aged\r\nand infirm, may add a third. In addition to the cardinals and the\r\nconclavists, there are enclosed a sacristan with his subsacristans, a\r\nsecretary with his undersecretaries, five masters of ceremonies, a\r\nconfessor, two physicians, a chirugeon, two barbers, an apothecary, with\r\ntheir respective boys, a mason, a carpenter, and servants for menial\r\nwork. Great care is taken that none of these lay-persons should be\r\nagents of the orators of the secular powers; and they are made to swear\r\na stringent oath of secrecy. As a matter of fact, they are not allowed\r\nto know anything of the proceedings in the Xystine Chapel. Meals are\r\nserved at stated hours, through a revolving cupboard (ruota) in the\r\nouter wall, supervised by cardinals-inspectors. Flagons are of bare\r\nglass, lumps of bread or meat are cut open, that no messages from the\r\nouter world may pass in by these means. Nor may any single thing pass\r\nout. Urgent private letters written in the Conclave are subject to\r\ncardinals-censors. Cardinals, who have need, may speak to visitors, but\r\nin presence of witnesses; and all communication must be open, and in a\r\nlanguage that all can understand. These interviews take place at a\r\nwindow, the cardinal being on the inside, his visitor on the outside:\r\nbut the conclavists and others are forbidden to approach the window on\r\nany pretext whatever.\r\n\r\nIn the Xystine Chapel, at the moment of the election, the cardinals\r\nalone are ocular and auricular witnesses of what takes place. Certainly\r\nall proceedings are recorded in the Acts of the Conclave. But the\r\noriginal acts of the Conclave that elected the Lord Alexander P.P. VI\r\nare not forthcoming: they very likely were lost in the Sack of Rome in\r\n1527, when the Catholic Catalans and Lutheran Goths of the Elect-Emperor\r\nDon Carlos V gambled in the gutters for nuns and for the wives and\r\ndaughters of Roman citizens. This then is the situation. All accounts of\r\nthe Conclave of 1492, including the dispatches of Orators to their\r\nrespective governments, are based on hearsay, or popular rumour.\r\nHistorians have no other material; for there is none.\r\n\r\nThe cry of simony always is raised at every election of a Pope. It is\r\nonly an exemplification of the law that Attraction and Repulsion are\r\nPrimary Forces. That the Lord Alexander P.P. VI on His election did\r\nstrip Himself of His new palace, and of His multitudinous benefices,\r\ncannot be denied. Why need it be denied? It always is done; for a\r\ncardinal who is elected Pope has no more need of these things: he leaves\r\nthem with his scarlet and ermine cappamagna when He is endued with the\r\nplain white frock of Christ’s Vicar. The giving away of His cast-off\r\ngoods and offices cannot be twisted into an act of simony, unless there\r\nis a distinct stipulation that they are given and taken as the price of\r\na vote. And no such distinct stipulation is extant. It is difficult to\r\nsee why cardinals should be considered likely to be guilty of such\r\ndegeneration. As a class of men they stand high: they generally are\r\npossessed of illustrious birth; they generally are possessed of such\r\nenormous wealth as to place them beyond the range of pecuniary\r\ntemptation; and invariably they are men of merit, the fine flower of\r\ntheir profession. As far as mundane honours go, they have tasted all the\r\nglory that the world can offer, except one glory. No layman may kneel on\r\nthe same bench with a cardinal, unless he be a reigning sovereign. No\r\nlayman may make a fourth in a carriage containing three cardinals, not\r\neven a reigning sovereign. Their rank places them far above peers or\r\nprinces. They are not eligible for the Athenæum Club, but nothing that\r\nthe world can offer will improve their position except the Papacy; yet\r\nthey are suspected, as a class, of intrigues and cabals of the basest\r\nkind, mere financial operations; and rarely, very rarely, is there any\r\nground for the suspicion, the prize for which they are said to struggle\r\ngenerally being beneath their notice, the petty advantage which they are\r\nthought to desire being unworthy even of their contempt; for cardinals\r\nare tired men, tired of splendour, tired of the earthly things; and they\r\nare not invariably vile.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the absurd people who wish to prove simoniacal the\r\nelection of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, or the stupid craven Catholics\r\nwho fatuously think to conciliate by joining rabidly in the hue and cry\r\nagainst a Pope, can show a definite declaration from one or more of the\r\ncardinals-assistant of the Conclave of 1492, couched in some such terms\r\nas these, “_I acknowledge and confess that, seduced by the dignities and\r\nthe money that he offered me_, (or, _intimidated by the menaces of\r\nCardinal Rodrigo de Lançol y Borja_,) _I allowed myself to be corrupted;\r\nand, against my will and better knowledge, I sold my vote to this\r\nunworthy cardinal_: or, _I declare that I have resisted all his\r\npromises, threats, and flatteries, and firmly have refused to sell my\r\nvote to Cardinal Rodrigo de Lançol y Borja_ : then, and only then, can\r\nthis silly or malicious calumny be said to have any foundation in\r\nfact.[76]\r\n\r\nOne thing is perfectly certain. The Lord Alexander P.P. VI, Who really\r\nwas the last man in the world _à S’ encanailler_, never behaved as\r\nthough He had gained the Triregno by illegitimate means. Not when all\r\nEurope yelped around His footstool did He blench or quail or shew a sign\r\nof fear. The heathen raged; and the people imagined a vain thing. The\r\nkings of the earth set themselves; and the rulers took counsel together.\r\nThe Monarchs of Naples nagged; the Catholic King and Queen denounced;\r\nthe Christian Kings minced, grimaced, and gibbered; Caesar Semper\r\nAugustus protested; Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere raved and nursed\r\nsedition; the barons of Rome revolted; the dukes and tyrants and\r\nrepublics of Italy took up arms; the dominions of the Pope’s Holiness\r\nwere invaded; the Eternal City suffered violence; the sacrosanctity of\r\nthe pontifical person was in imminent danger: but the invincible Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI magnificently retired into the Mola of Hadrian, the\r\nonly spot in all Christendom where His rule remained; and held His Own,\r\ninflexibly, implacably, with an enormous dignity impossible in one who\r\nwas a mere usurper, a venal simoniac. So much is sure. The demeanour of\r\nthe Lord Alexander P.P. VI in direst straits, was the demeanour of a man\r\nwho had no doubt regarding his own integrity.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe so-called scandals of His private life are shewn to have been based\r\nupon the malice or the idle gossip of His enemies. He sat in “the fierce\r\nlight that beats upon a throne.” He was the father of a family. He was\r\nnot the first or the last Pope Who has been the father of a family. His\r\nimmediate predecessor, the Lord Innocent P.P. VIII, admitted the\r\npaternity of seven children. A successor, the Lord Paul P.P. III, also\r\nused Himself in a similar manner: nor are these all. If this be vicious,\r\nit was only vicious in the Lord Alexander P.P. VI because He was the\r\nLord Alexander P.P. VI; for in other men the same thing was, and is,\r\ntolerated, accepted, applauded. A patrician or a plebeian may steal a\r\nhorse: but a Pope may not look over the wall. _Ille crucem sceleris\r\npretium tulit, hic diadema._[77] However, as a father, He exhibited an\r\nillustrious example of paternal virtue. He was kind, loving,\r\naffectionate to his children; solicitous and self sacrificing for their\r\nwelfare and advancement. That He employed His spiritual power, to build\r\nup the temporalities of His family, was a temptation, to avoid which He\r\nwould need to have been more than human. It was the custom of the time.\r\nIt was an imperious necessity of the situation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe murders and venenations of which He has been accused, in company\r\nwith Duke Cesare, fail of proof; and indeed His guiltlessness as\r\ninstigator, principal, or accomplice, appears in every case to be beyond\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe murder of Don Juan Francisco de Lançol y Borja, Duke of Gandia,\r\nremains a mystery: but what evidence there is distinctly points to a\r\nvendetta of Orsini directed against the Pope through His\r\nCaptain-General.\r\n\r\nThe murder of the Prince of Bisceglia is referable rather to a vendetta\r\nof Sanseverini and Caïetani, than to the Pope or Duke Cesare (detto\r\nBorgia).\r\n\r\nThe deaths of Don Astorgio and Don Gianevangelista Manfredi are\r\nsusceptible of the Venetian Orator’s explanation, _puto mal san_; there\r\npositively is nothing to connect the Pope or the Duke with them.\r\n\r\nThe death of the Sultán Djim was due to natural causes, while he was in\r\nthe hands of the Christian King; and the Pope’s Holiness was a pecuniary\r\nloser (to the extent of about £80,000 a year) by his death.\r\n\r\nThe death of Cardinal Orsini was due to natural causes, according to the\r\nsworn testimony of physicians provided by the House of Orsini.\r\n\r\nFra Girolamo Savonarola Ο.P. was executed on a capital charge by due\r\nprocess of law; and the Pope was an unwilling agent for the\r\nadministration of that law.\r\n\r\n(The crime of Fra Girolamo really was that of intriguing with a foreign\r\npower with which his country was at war. General Booth committing\r\ntreachery with Mr. Kruger, or Mr. Ira D. Sankey with the Son of Heaven\r\nKwang Su, would be Twentieth Century parallels of Savonarola and Charles\r\nVIII.)\r\n\r\nCardinal Giovanni Borgia (detto Giuniore) died a natural death.\r\n\r\nMesser Ramiro d’ Orco, Don Vitellozzo Vitelli, and Don Oliverotto da\r\nFermo had a legal trial by court-martial, and paid the legal penalty of\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nDon Paolo and Duke Francesco Orsini of Gravina suffered merited death,\r\ndue to the exigencies of civil war in which they and their House were\r\nthe aggressors.\r\n\r\nThere remain two other violent deaths to be accounted for, which were\r\nnot of sufficient importance to treat of in the history of this\r\npontificate, the case of Calderon Perotto, and that of Messer Francesco\r\nTrocces.\r\n\r\nIt is said by Don Paolo Capello, the Orator of Venice, in his Diarium,\r\n(or rather in that edition of the said Diarium which was prepared forty\r\nyears later by Don Marino Sanuto,) that Calderon Perotto was a Spanish\r\nlad of eighteen years, one of the Pontifical pages; and that he was\r\nstabbed by Duke Cesare (detto Borgia) at the Pope’s feet. The fact is\r\nrelated without comment or explanation. It would not be safe to attach\r\nmuch importance to the statement, because Don Paolo Capello’s original\r\ndocument is not forthcoming and Don Marino Sanuto’s version of what he\r\nwrote is the only version accessible. But the alleged murder of the page\r\nPerotto is not, like other calumnies, a posthumous invention; for it is\r\nmentioned in the atrocious _Letter to Silvio Savelli_ described on an\r\nearlier page. The Pope is not, and was not blamed. The murder, if it\r\nwere a murder at all, is attributed to Duke Cesare (detto Borgia); and\r\nit was not an unusual thing for a lord to slay a servant in the Borgian\r\nEra. That was common enough; but to do it in the presence of the\r\nHoliness of the Pope certainly was sacrilege; and this last circumstance\r\nmakes it probable that the whole story is a pure invention; for the\r\nguilt of sacrilege lightly was not incurred even by the most bloody and\r\nabandoned villains: and Duke Cesare was not of that species.\r\n\r\nThe other death, that of Messer Francesco Trocces is more probable, and\r\nmentioned in several dispatches of Orators. He was a papal chamberlain\r\n(confidential flunkey of the cloak and sword,—minor situation dear to\r\n_petits maîtres_ of the English and Keltic bourgeoisie now;) and was\r\nemployed as governmental courier. The Republic of Venice was playing\r\nfast and loose with the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, disliking to see Duke\r\nCesare’s amazing success in the Romagna; and its Orator, Don Antonio\r\nGiustiniani carried on relations of a doubtful kind with Messer\r\nFrancesco Trocces, in the usual manner of ambassadors who find that they\r\ncan buy state-secrets from a “crapule.” Suddenly, Messer Francesco fled\r\nfrom Rome to Civita Vecchia. He had been complaining to the Venetians\r\nabout Duke Cesare; and all his treachery had come to light. The Duke’s\r\nsteel claws were far-reaching. The traitor was captured there and\r\nbrought to Rome, strangled, and his body hanged on Tor Savelli as an\r\nexample to others of his kind. Legally speaking he was executed for the\r\ncrime of high treason; and the formal exposure of his corpse gives the\r\nlie to the idea of clandestine assassination. The practice of secret\r\ntrials and summary executions is odious to the Twentieth Century: but,\r\nin the Fifteenth and Sixteenth, not only all civilized governments, but\r\neven barons who had power of life and death over their retainers, used\r\nthese means as a matter of course; and that alone should be sufficient\r\nto exonerate the Borgia from blame.\r\n\r\nIt has been said of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI that He habitually\r\nenvenomed his cardinals, that He might have their goods. The following\r\nstory is given, not in this connection, by Mr. F. Marion Crawford, and\r\nis here inserted on account of its frequent significance. At the corner\r\nof the Via Lata in the Corso of Rome, is the Palazzo Doria Pamphili, a\r\ntypical Roman palace of the Borgian Era, two-thirds the size of the\r\nVatican Basilica, and able to accommodate a thousand inhabitants. It was\r\nbuilt by Cardinal Santorio (?), who bought the site from the Chapter of\r\nSanta Maria _Maggiore_, and expended thousands of gold ducats in the\r\nerection of a House Beautiful. All through the reigns of the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI and of the Lord Pius P.P. III, he remained in\r\nunmolested possession: but during the pontificate of the Lord Julius\r\nP.P. II (Giuliano della Rovere) the Pope’s Holiness said to him that his\r\npalace was “more suitable for a secular duke than for a prince of the\r\nChurch”; and forced him to make Him a free gift of it for His Own nephew\r\nDon Francesco della Rovere, whom He had created Duke of Urbino. The\r\nunfortunate Cardinal Santorio died soon after of a broken heart. It was\r\nnot Borgia who caused _his_ death, in order to have his palace: but\r\nBorgia’s eternal enemy.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a secular sovereign, no contemporary of His even deserves to be named\r\nin comparison with the Lord Alexander P.P. VI. His reign broke the back\r\nof the turbulent ambitious selfish baronage which had ravaged the papal\r\nstates for centuries. He was an independent Pope; willing to enter into\r\nalliances, it is true, so long as they served His purpose: but just as\r\nwilling to throw over His allies and stand alone upon occasion. If His\r\ninterests leaned more in one direction than another, it may be taken\r\nthat He was a Sforza + Cesarini Pope, rather than a creature of Colonna\r\nor Orsini as the custom was. His political policy entirely was directed\r\nto the substitution of peace and order with security of life and\r\nproperty, instead of the anarchy and desolation which He saw on His\r\naccession. He fully lived up to His official title of RULER OF THE\r\nWORLD; and the sovereigns of Europe at all times found Him sternly\r\nrigorously just, amenable neither to fear nor flattery. He was an\r\nadmirable FATHER OF PRINCES AND OF KINGS. Notwithstanding all that\r\nweakly has been said to the contrary, the Holy Roman Church and\r\nChristendom owe a vast debt of gratitude to Him. He found feebleness and\r\nwar and tumult at His coming: at His going He left behind Him\r\ndifferences removed, rebellions quelled, and a tradition of consolidated\r\nstrength. He was the Fosterer of Justice and of Peace. He was a great\r\nand wise Princeps.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs Pontifex Maximus, EARTHLY VICAR OF JESUS CHRIST OUR SAVIOUR, He\r\nmerits reverent admiration. His habits and tastes were of the simplest\r\nkind, in an age of singular luxury. He was temperate in His diet; and\r\nthe Orators of the Powers commented with disgust upon the fact that He\r\nnever had more than one dish upon His table. He slept but little. His\r\namusements occupied a mere fraction of His time: but, during recreation,\r\nHe unbent His awful dignity, and enjoyed Himself with the frank abandon\r\nof a school boy. He was a patron of painters: but men of letters\r\nincontinently drove their pens against Him; for the Lord Alexander P.P.\r\nVI was confronted by the problem of dealing with a new enemy to Christ’s\r\nflock and to civilization—He had to regulate the printing-press in the\r\ninterest of morals; and, as a duty of His office, He ordained the\r\ncensorship of printed books, He inaugurated the “Imprimatur,” He\r\n“muzzled the printer’s devil.”\r\n\r\nYet He was a gentle and kindly-affectioned Shepherd. In 1492, the Jews\r\nwere expelled from Spain. He entertained them in security in Rome. In\r\n1494, He was horrified by news of the diabolical atrocities of the Grand\r\nInquisitor of Spain; and, though He Himself was a Spaniard, He appointed\r\nfour assessors with equal power, to restrain the excesses of Torquemada.\r\nThe Spanish Inquisition never had the countenance of Rome, but Her\r\nbitterest opposition. The wanton ingenious cruelty of that infamous\r\nTribunal was due to the fiendish strain of African black blood which\r\ntinges and defiles the bluest blood of Spain; and was committed in\r\nexplicit defiance of the commands of God’s Vicegerent. It is true that\r\nHe gave America to Spain, and Africa to Portugal.[78] The Bulls of\r\nDonation shew that He considered it to be the Pope’s duty to teach the\r\nGospel to all nations, and to compel the observance of natural laws. He\r\nbelieved that, before the heathen could hear the Gospel, or observe\r\nthose laws, it was necessary to make them subjects of a Christian Power.\r\nHe knew that conquest makes more converts in one day, than preaching in\r\nthree hundred years. He took as abruptly practical and business-like a\r\nview of things as though He had been fortunate enough to have been born\r\nan Englishman. And He acted upon the extremely scriptural principle that\r\ncivil rights and civil authorities lawfully cannot obstruct the\r\npropagation of the Faith. None knew better than He that the Treasure was\r\nin an earthen vessel[79]: but, as the chief bishop of the Church far\r\nabove all principality and power and might and dominion,[80] He spoke,\r\nexhorted, and rebuked, with an authority. Let no man despise Him.[81]\r\nThere was no other representative of Christianity; there was no other,\r\nin all the world, who even claimed to be the representative of\r\nChristianity, at that time. The Lord Alexander P.P. VI, magnificent and\r\ninvincible, was the only one. Let no man despise Him.\r\n\r\nAs Pastor, He was merciful; as Judge, severe and just. His laws against\r\nwitchcraft and Black Magic were of the most stringent kind. He used the\r\nmeans which every other sovereign of Europe also used. “East of Suez,\r\nsome hold, the direct control of Providence ceases; Man being there\r\nhanded over to the power of the Gods and Devils of Asia—” the most\r\nobservant of modern English writers says. Men who have lived in the Far\r\nEast, where Christian influence is very feeble, will recognize the\r\nsingular correctness of Mr. Rudyard Kipling’s theory. Men, also, who at\r\nfirst hand have studied modern recrudescences of devil-worship, modern\r\nflirtations with kakodaimoniacal agencies, the Luciferianism of modern\r\nFrance, will not mutter with patronizing superiority of superstitions\r\nand old wives’ fables; but perfectly well will know that hideous\r\nabnormity with which the Pope’s Holiness had to deal. Only the wilfully\r\nignorant deny the actuality of diabolic manifestations, called\r\nwitchcraft and Black Magic in the vulgar tongue. The ostrich who buries\r\nher head in sand is like to these. By the side of high civilization\r\nthere always runs the impulse to savagery, the weird and radical\r\ndecadence which wanders on dark paths. Hellas and Rome pried into the\r\nmysteries of Isis; Christendom entertains Turlupins, Rosicrucians,\r\nIndian gumnosophists, and Mahatmas; the Borgian Era played with the\r\nRoaring Lion; the Victorian Era with Sathanas and his sorrows.\r\n“Perhaps”, “after all”, “audi alteram partem”,—hesitation, compromise,\r\nwant of defined principle, lack of courageous singleness of\r\nmind,—amounting to Emasculation—is the mental note of the Twentieth\r\nCentury. The Fifteenth had not a tithe of the knowledge now possessed:\r\nbut it was awfully convinced, strong, and decisive, within its\r\nlimitations. Then, there was no place for the palterer—except against\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\nOther malefactors felt the flail which, like Osiris, He wielded equally\r\nwith the crook. Notaries of the Pontifical Briefs debauched by the\r\nundisciplined rule of previous Popes, had become corrupt. In the absence\r\nof restraint they habitually forged briefs nominating to benefices, not\r\nonly in Italy, but in all Christian countries. The ambition of German\r\nclergy created the demand. The flagitious notaries managed the supply.\r\nThey sold their forged briefs privately to whoso would pay the price,\r\nand they pocketed the proceeds of this nefarious traffic. In 1497, the\r\nLord Alexander P.P. VI found them out. Some promptly were broiled on\r\nCampo di Fiori, the nineteenth of October; one, the Lord Archbishop of\r\nCosenza, and three secretaries, deprived of their benefices and degraded\r\nfrom their clerical estate, solemnly were immured alive in the Mola of\r\nHadrian. These miserable criminals lived some years in their solitary\r\ncells, as the custom was, literally feeding on the bread of tears and\r\nthe water of affliction until they died. (_Burchard_, _Diarium_.) One\r\nhas heard fables of nuns immured. Here is a fairly genuine case of an\r\nimmured archbishop. Immuration is the same punishment which the\r\nTwentieth Century metes out in countries where capital punishment has\r\nbeen abolished:—solitary confinement;—nothing more. The archbishopric of\r\nCosenza was conferred on Cardinal Francisco de Borja, bastard of the\r\nLord Calixtus P. P. III.\r\n\r\nThe assiduous attention to the duties of His office which the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI exhibited is perfectly astounding; and pregnant with\r\nindubitable signification.\r\n\r\nHe reformed the monasteries of Austria, and the secular clergy of\r\nPortugal. He confirmed the Rule of the Religion of Friars Minim, founded\r\nby San Francesco da Paola. He approved the Rule of the Third Order of\r\nFriars Minor, founded by San Francesco d’Assisi. He permitted Madame\r\nJean de Valois to found her Religion. In 1499, He confirmed the Rule of\r\nthe Jesnats of San Girolamo, a congregation of laymen leading a\r\nreligious communal life under the Rule of St. Aurelius Augustine,\r\nnursing the sick, and distilling aquavitæ, (as Carthusians distil\r\nChartreuse, yellow and green, now.) He founded and confirmed in Rome the\r\nOrder of Military Knights of St. George, for the defence of Christendom\r\nagainst the Muslim Infidel. He granted privileges to the College at\r\nWindsor: (Chapter of St. George, or King Henry VI Plantagenet’s\r\nFoundation at Eton?) He approved the Order of Praying Knights of St.\r\nMichael in France. He reformed the Order of Military Knights of Christ\r\nin Portugal. He canonized no saints. His personal piety was simple,\r\ndiligent, and real. He greatly revered the Deipara, the Blessed Virgin\r\nMary. In her honour, He ordained the bell which rings at sunset,\r\nsunrise, and noon, for the _Angelus Domini_ in memory of The\r\nIncarnation. On His death-bed, He said, “We always have had, and have, a\r\nsingular affection for the Most Holy Virgin.”\r\n\r\nIn the Secret Archives of the Vatican, (merely a technical term, for\r\nthey are open to all the world,) His original acts are preserved; the\r\nveritable Briefs and Bulls which He laboured to utter during His reign.\r\nThey are bound in one hundred and thirteen large-folio volumes, each\r\ntome containing about ten thousand separate documents.[82] To understand\r\nwhat kind of thing is a Papal Bull or Brief, the Epistles of St. Peter,\r\nwhich are easily accessible, may be mentioned as the best examples\r\nextant;—earnest disquisitions, simple or scholarly, dealing\r\nauthoritatively with subjects the most vital. The Lord Alexander P.P. VI\r\nis responsible for more than a million of these; and He only reigned\r\neleven years.\r\n\r\nThe days and nights appreciably were not longer then than now. WHERE,\r\nTHEN, DID THE LORD ALEXANDER P.P. VI FIND THE TIME TO ACCOMPLISH THE\r\nMULTIFARIOUS TURPITUDES WITH WHICH HE HAS BEEN CHARGED?\r\n\r\nHe was the father of bastards. He was not the first or last,—plebeian,\r\npatrician, potentate, or pontiff.\r\n\r\nHe was inflexible to foes. Was ever peace assured except by a stern\r\nmartinet?\r\n\r\nThe Lord Alexander P.P. VI was a very great Prince, a very faithful\r\nPastor, a very human Man.\r\n\r\nBy members of that Church, at least, which He so ably ruled, He should\r\nbe regarded as above and beyond criticism (so-called), amenable to no\r\njudge, ecclesiastical, or secular.[83] For the rest—the dwellers in\r\nglass houses....\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Sparks that Die\r\n\r\n  “_A fire, that is kindled, begins with smoke and hissing, while it\r\n      lays hold on the faggots; bursts into a roaring blaze, with raging\r\n      tongues of flame, devouring all in reach, spangled with sparks\r\n      that die._”\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the death of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, Duke Cesare de Valentinois\r\ndella Romagna was the most potent personage in Italy. Several of his\r\nveteran legions under Don Michelotto held the Eternal City. Usually,\r\nduring the Novendiati after a Pope’s demise, armed bands of Colonna\r\nand Orsini pervaded the streets, to intimidate the Conclave with their\r\nwar-cries _Column—Column—_, _Bear—Bear—_. In August and September\r\n1503, the baronial partizans were dumb; and all Rome shouted\r\n_Duca—Duca—Duca—_for Duke Cesare. He might have done anything that he\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nNow, if Duke Cesare were the ambitious ruthless impious despot and\r\nvillain which a fashion has painted him, he must also have been a fool;\r\nin that he did not force the Sacred College to raise another Borgia to\r\nPeter’s Throne. There were three Borgia cardinals ready to his hand, all\r\nquiet and malleable and inoffensive, and two of them aged men; viz.,\r\n\r\n  (α) the Lord Luis Juan de Mila y Borja, Cardinal-Prior-Presbyter of\r\n        the Title of Santi Quattro Coronati and Bishop of Lerida; first\r\n        cousin and contemporary of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI:\r\n\r\n  (β) the Lord Francisco de Borja, Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of\r\n        San Nereo e Sant’ Achilleo, Archbishop of Cosenza; bastard of\r\n        the Lord Calixtus P.P. III:\r\n\r\n  (γ) the Lord Pedro Luis de Borja y Lançol, Cardinal-Deacon of Santa\r\n        Maria in Via Lata; son of the late Pope’s sister Doña Juana de\r\n        Borja by her marriage with her cousin Don Guillelmo de Lançol.\r\n\r\nThe last was a young man, a contemporary of Duke Cesare himself, and\r\nappears to have been of a modest and retiring disposition. Whether his\r\nyouth would have taken fire at being crowned with the Triregno, is an\r\nopen question. He was not elected, and is numbered with the sparks that\r\ndie. The Cardinal de Mila had resided nearly half a century at his\r\nbishopric in Spain; and was completely out of touch with his Italian\r\nrelatives, as well as with the Sacred College.\r\n\r\nBut Cardinal Francisco de Borja seems to have been an ideal nominee for\r\nthe purpose of Duke Cesare. He owed his rank to the Lord Alexander P.P.\r\nVI. He was of the age of sixty-two years, a gentle old gentleman of\r\nplacid nature, of sweet and lovable habits, easily plastic. If he had\r\nbeen elected Pope by the influence of Duke Cesare, the consolidation of\r\nthe Borgia Dynasty would have been an accomplished fact. Theoretically,\r\nit matters not a jot who may be the Pope, Caius or Balbus, Peter or\r\nPaul. If there be any basis for the claims of the Holy Roman Church, Her\r\nmission goes on till the world’s end, as well and as inevitably when\r\nBorgia, as when Pecci, reigns; as well and as inevitably under Boys of\r\nthe age of twelve and eighteen years, like the Lord Benedict P.P. IX and\r\nthe Lord John P.P. XII, as under Saints, like the Lord St. Sylvester\r\nP.P. and the Lord St. Fabian P.P. ; as well and as inevitably under a\r\nJew, like the Lord St. Peter P.P. as under an Englishman like the Lord\r\nHadrian P.P. IV. The personality of God’s Vicegerent is of no\r\nconsequence whatever to the purity of the Faith, or to the triumph of\r\nthe Holy Roman Church. These things being so, it is hard to understand\r\nwhy Duke Cesare did not menace with his unconquerable army the Sacred\r\nCollege, or assassinate samples of the cardinals who should decline to\r\nvote at his direction; until, by ultimate intimidation, he should have\r\nsecured the election of his candidate. If he had been the godless wretch\r\nthat his enemies designated, he would have achieved some such\r\n_colpo-di-stato_ as this.\r\n\r\nBut, in the _rôle_ of an unconscionable villain, Duke Cesare was a\r\nfailure—an accented failure. Contrariwise, he comported himself as\r\nexemplarily as any good and pious Catholic. Most likely his fever, or\r\nthe murderous remedies of his physicians, was responsible for this.\r\nThere is no doubt but that the scheme for a Borgia Dynasty had been\r\nadumbrated; and that this was the psychological moment for giving it\r\nconcrete expression: but the death of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, and\r\nDuke Cesare’s own illness came with sobering effect to him; and his\r\ncourse of action may be translated thus—that he resolved not to usurp\r\nthe prerogative of the Supreme Disposer of events. For a villain, the\r\nresolve was weak: but it was what was to be expected of a splendid man\r\nof sense.\r\n\r\nDuke Cesare knew that he held his riches, his supremacy, his titles of\r\nDuke of Romagna, Gonfalonier of the Holy Roman Church, and Castellan of\r\nSantangelo, solely at the pleasure of the Pope; yet he made no effort to\r\nsecure the election of a Pope who would confirm his possession of them.\r\nThere is still in existence a ring of his, (they call it a “Poison\r\nRing”—but of that much has been said—) which bears the splendid motto\r\n\r\n                    FAYS CEQUE DOYS AVIEN QUE POURRA\r\n                      _Do thy duty, come what may._\r\n\r\nThat principle informed his action now. Duke Cesare did his duty.\r\n\r\nHe renewed his feudal oath of allegiance in the presence of the Sacred\r\nCollege. He formally recognized the supremacy, during the interregnum,\r\nof the Cardinal-Dean and the Cardinal-Chamberlain. He divested himself\r\nof the semblance and reality of power, by relinquishing the Mola of\r\nHadrian (which impregnable fortress he held as Castellan of Santangelo,\r\nand whence he could have overawed both the Vatican and Rome). Further,\r\nfinding that the mere presence of his army in the City was considered\r\ndisrespectful to the Conclave, he retired it to his province of the\r\nRomagna; and he himself withdrew to France to his duchy of Valentinois.\r\n\r\nSo, the Conclave of 1503 met in absolute freedom; and elected, as\r\nSuccessor of St. Peter, Ruler of the World, Father of Princes and of\r\nKings, and Earthly Vicar of Jesus Christ our Saviour, the Lord Francesco\r\nde’ Piccolhuomini, Cardinal-Archdeacon of Sant’ Eustachio, Archbishop of\r\nSiena, who deigned to be called the Lord Pius P. P. III, in memory of\r\nHis august uncle, the Lord Pius P. P. II[84] Who had reigned from 1458\r\nto 1464.\r\n\r\nThen momentous events came thick and fast. The new Pope, on His\r\ncoronation in St. Peter’s, graciously permitted Duke Cesare to return to\r\nRome. Such a mighty and splendid vassal as he was naturally inspired\r\nfear and distrust among the clergy. Such a trenchant weapon as he\r\npossessed in his unconquerable veteran army was described as a danger to\r\nthe papacy. It is always very hard to make the clergy understand that a\r\nlaic can be as sentimental and conscientious and self sacrificing as a\r\nclerk. The word was put about that, seeing the Romagna to have been\r\nreduced to order, the necessity for Duke Cesare’s army had ceased to be.\r\nNaturally, the clergy could not be expected to understand the necessity\r\nfor an “army of occupation.” The first rumour speedily grew into the\r\nstatement that Duke Cesare’s army was to be disbanded.\r\n\r\nColonna and Orsini heard, in their ugly exile, in their battered\r\nfortresses. Like the chained wolves on the Capitol who know when rust\r\nmakes thin their fetters, they lifted up their horrid heads and waited\r\ntill the ultimate link should part. If Duke Cesare’s army were\r\ndisbanded, thousands of condottieri would be at large, brigands ready to\r\ntake service under a new chief, under any banner. Why not under the\r\nbanners of the Column and the Bear? Colonna and Orsini in alliance,\r\nreinforced by those same unconquerable mercenaries might recover their\r\nold position, and once more become the strong right and left hands of a\r\nfeeble Pope of their own; and then the days of the hated Borgia would be\r\nnumbered. Colonna and Orsini, like their antipodes righteousness and\r\npeace, forgot their ancient feud and each kissed other. Duke Cesare\r\nindeed was in evil case.\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, after a pontificate of six and twenty days, the Lord\r\nPius P.P. III died.\r\n\r\nThis moment was the opportunity of the psychic epileptic, the Lord\r\nCardinal-Bishop Giuliano della Rovere, eternal enemy of the House of\r\nBorgia. He had emerged from the exile, which his innumerable treasons\r\nand malfeasances had merited, in time for the election of the Lord Pius\r\nP.P. III during Whose short reign he had employed himself to his own\r\nadvantage. He had no friends. He gained the loathing of all with whom he\r\nhad to do. The Sacred College to a man was inimical to him. He was not\r\nwealthy. He was thoroughly plebeian, he had no learning, no diplomatic\r\nskill, no charm. And there, on the other hand, was the splendid Duke\r\nCesare, feared; yes: but admired also; and his unconquerable army was\r\nwithin call. A second time the election appeared likely to depend on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nCardinal Giuliano della Rovere was a desperate man. The only advantage\r\nthat he possessed was, that at this time when all the other cardinals\r\nwere in a state of nervous perturbation at the unusual occurrence of the\r\ndeaths of two Popes in three months, he alone preserved his equanimity.\r\nHe alone knew what he wanted. His colleagues in the Conclave were\r\nmentally collapsed: they shewed signs of a liability to come under the\r\ninfluence of, to take advice, to take even direction from any one who\r\nwould tell them what they wanted; and chiefly from him who was the one\r\nstrong man of Italy, the man with the veteran army, Duke Cesare de\r\nValentinois della Romagna (detto Borgia). The strongest laic is no match\r\nfor an unscrupulous clerk when it comes to wits. Cardinal Giuliano della\r\nRovere saw that he could gain the Sacred College, by gaining Duke\r\nCesare. He concentrated all his crude rough desperate will on the one\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe historian Varillas, who writes as a violent upholder of the Papacy,\r\nrelates an extraordinary story; which, if true, is a veritable solution\r\nof mysteries; which, in short, is so strange, that it very likely is not\r\nfiction, historical or otherwise, but the blind and naked Truth emerging\r\nfrom her well unabashed, luciferous, and, naturally, unwelcome.\r\n\r\nHe says that Duke Cesare proposed to the Second Conclave of 1503 to\r\nelect a cardinal whom he should name: that Cardinal Giuliano della\r\nRovere, becoming aware of this, endeavoured to attract Duke Cesare’s\r\ninfluence to himself: that to this end the said Cardinal privately\r\nannounced to the said Duke that he was his father after the manner of\r\nmen, further alleging this to have been the cause of his (the said\r\ncardinal’s) enmity against the Lord Alexander P.P. VI deceased: that the\r\nsaid Cardinal asked the said Duke to assist him, his father, to gain the\r\npapal throne, promising, in return for such assistance, after his\r\ncoronation with the Triregno, publicly to acknowledge the said Duke as\r\nhis son, to confirm him in possession of his duchies and his conquests,\r\nand to retain him in all the offices which he then held: that the said\r\nDuke believed the said Cardinal, and by withdrawing from opposition, and\r\nby exerting full influence in a filial manner, he had compassed the\r\nelection of the said Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere: that after his\r\nelection the said Cardinal had belied all his promises, deprived the\r\nsaid Duke, of Umbria, and the Romagna, and all the fiefs which he had\r\nwon, and of all the situations which he enjoyed, and finally had\r\nharassed, despoiled, and exiguously persecuted, all who bore the name\r\nof, or were connected with, The Borgia.\r\n\r\nThis is an extremely probable tale. Certainly a part of it is true, and\r\nperhaps the whole.\r\n\r\nThe identity of the father of Duke Cesare (detto Borgia) is involved in\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nThe Brief of the Lord Xystus P.P. IV[85] dated the first of October\r\n1480, which dispenses Messer Cesare from the necessity of proving his\r\nlegitimacy, calls him “son of a cardinal bishop and a married woman,”\r\n_de episcopo cardinali genitus et coniugata_.\r\n\r\nThe Brief of the Same, dated the sixteenth of August 1482, which makes\r\nCardinal Rodrigo de Lançol y Borja administrator of Messer Cesare’s\r\nestate, calls the boy “son of a cardinal bishop and a married woman,”\r\n_de episcopo cardinali genitus et coniugata_.\r\n\r\nThe name of this “cardinal bishop” is not given in either Brief.\r\n\r\nMost of the scribblers, diarists, chroniclers, orators, speak of Don\r\nCesare, Cardinal Cesare, and Duke Cesare, as the son of Cardinal Rodrigo\r\nde Lançol y Borja (the Lord Alexander P.P. VI). Some, like Peter Martyr\r\nand Fioramondo Brugnolo call him “nephew of a brother of our Lord the\r\nPope.” In his autograph letter to the Pope, dated the sixteenth of\r\nJanuary 1500, he himself speaks of Cardinal Giovanni Borgia (detto\r\nGiuniore), (who was the son of Don Pedro Luis de Lançol y Borja, own\r\nbrother of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI) as “my brother.”\r\n\r\nIn no official document is he named as the son of Cardinal Rodrigo de\r\nLançol y Borja (the Lord Alexander P.P. VI): but the Venetian Senate, in\r\nconferring on him the patriciate of that Republic in 1500, styled him\r\n“nephew of Pope Alexander.”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Alexander P.P. VI never called him “son”: but, in an autograph\r\nBrief of recommendation addressed to the Christian King Louis XII, He\r\nintroduced Duke Cesare as His “heart.”\r\n\r\nDuke Cesare’s subscription of a letter, which he wrote to the Pope on\r\nthe twenty-eighth of January 1503, at the time of the Orsini revolt, is\r\nvery curious. He signed himself “The most humble servant and most\r\nfaithful handiwork of Your Holiness.” _Vestrae Sanctitatis humillimus\r\nservus et devotissima factura._ As cardinal he might, and did, call\r\nhimself the Pope’s “creature,” _creatura_: that is the form. A son,\r\nhowever, is not “handiwork” in any sense of the word: but a duke, who is\r\nmade by his sovereign’s signature of his patent, precisely is.\r\n\r\nThe authorities, who call Duke Cesare “nephew,” may be dismissed. Popes,\r\nlike other human beings, generally have nephews _stricte dicte vel\r\nlate_.\r\n\r\nHis own appellation of Cardinal Giovanni Giuniore is susceptible of the\r\nmeaning “comrade.”\r\n\r\nAnd “factura” will bear reference to his duchy, gonfalonierate,\r\ncastellanship, etc.\r\n\r\nWho then was the father of Duke Cesare?\r\n\r\nMadonna Giovanna de’ Catanei (wife of Don Giorgio della Croce, and,\r\nafter his death, of Don Carlo Canale,) was certainly his mother. Two\r\nofficial inscriptions bear witness to this. The first, which was\r\npublished by Signor Gnoli in the _Nuova Antologia_ of the first of\r\nFebruary 1881, refers to a house on Campo di Fiori which she left as an\r\nendowment for anniversary masses for the repose of the souls of herself\r\nand her two husbands named. The deed is the work of Messer Andrea\r\nCaroso, Notary Public, and is dated the fifteenth of January 1517. In it\r\nshe is called “Vanoza Catanea _madre del Duca Borge_.” The second is her\r\nepitaph on her tomb in Santa Maria del Popolo (Forcella. Iscrizioni\r\ndelle chiese di Roma I. 335) shewing her natural pride at finding\r\nherself the mother of two dukes, a prince duke, and a sovereign duchess.\r\n\r\n   “Faustiae Cathanae, _Caesare Valentiae_, Joannae Candiae,\r\n   Jufredo Scylatii, et Lucretia Ferrariae ducib. filiis nobili\r\n   Probitate insigni religioni eximia pari et aetate et\r\n   Prudentiae optime de xenodochio Lateranen. Meritae\r\n   Hieronimus Picus fidei commis. procur. ex test(amento) pos(uit).\r\n   Vix(it) ann. LXXVI m. IV d. XIII. Objit anno M.D.XVIII. XXVI Nov.”\r\n\r\nIn the absence of anything more authoritative than the foregoing, the\r\nstory of Varillas remains the most probable solution of the mystery. The\r\nLord Alexander P.P. VI never named, never treated, Duke Cesare as His\r\nson; never shewed for him the paternal love and affection which He\r\nshewed for his bastards, Don Pedro Luis, Madonna Girolama, Duke Juan\r\nFrancisco, Duchess Lucrezia, Prince Gioffredo, Madonna Laura, Duke\r\nGiovanni. Yet Duke Cesare was splendid and superb; his abilities were\r\nimmense, and pre-eminently useful to the Pope. And the Pope used him on\r\nall occasions as His most serviceable subject, rewarding him with lavish\r\ngenerosity for the service which he rendered. Between the Duke and his\r\nSovereign Patron, there was a certain privileged and familiar\r\nconfidence: but never intimate relationship, or filial or paternal love.\r\n\r\nThe status of Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere; his furious, blind,\r\ninstinctive, and eternal hatred of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI and of\r\nevery one connected with Him, is susceptible of an extremely human\r\nexplanation. It bears the strongest possible resemblance to that very\r\nsingular and very distinguishable passion of revengeful jealous rage\r\nwhich consumes the vulgar man in regard to a superior (in rank,\r\nbreeding, or physique,) who shall have supplanted him in the favours of\r\na lady.\r\n\r\nCardinal Rodrigo and Cardinal Giuliano both were cardinals and bishops\r\nat the time of the birth of Duke Cesare. Cardinal Rodrigo had wealth,\r\nillustrious ancestry, incomparable charm of manner, a sumptuous aspect.\r\nHe was magnificent and invincible. Cardinal Giuliano as a boy had\r\npeddled onions in a boat between Arbisola and Genoa, he had no money\r\nexcept the revenues of a few benefices, he was of a saturnine habit of\r\nmind, repulsive to his fellow creatures. His portraits, as cardinal on\r\nhis medal by Sperandio, as Pope by Il Caradosso (Ambrogio Foppa), shew\r\nhim as a hatefully ugly man with satyr-brows, sunken and bleared eyes,\r\nfierce but haggard mien, and the animal appetites hugely predominant in\r\nthe lips, the back of the head, and the curious little muscles which\r\nobliquely tend downward right and left in the region of the root of the\r\nnose. In the age of the Discovery of Man, Cardinal Giuliano della\r\nRovere’s physique did not qualify him to gain, or retain, the fidelity\r\nof any woman whom, inevitably, he would hunger to possess.\r\n\r\nNothing is known against the character of Madonna Giovanna de’ Catanei\r\nexcept that she was the mistress, first of Cardinal Giuliano della\r\nRovere, second of Cardinal Rodrigo de Lançol y Borja. A woman who\r\nindulges in systematic adultery _and sacrilege_ is liable to be as false\r\nto her lovers, as she is to her husband and her God, at least until she\r\nhas repented of her crimes and sins, giving proof of her repentance by\r\nsurceasing from those same to lead a godly righteous and sober life, as\r\nMadonna Giovanna did during the whole reign of the Lord Alexander P.P.\r\nVI, and especially in, and after, 1508, when she was converted, together\r\nwith Madonna Fiametta, a leman of Duke Cesare’s, by hearing Frat’ Egidio\r\nda Viterbo preach the Lent in Rome. But history and rumour agree in\r\nthis, that with the exception of these two separate intrigues lasting\r\nfrom 1473 to 1481 Madonna Giovanna de’ Catanei was “alioquin proba\r\nmulier” as even the rascally Paulo Giovio says, (Vita Gonsalvi\r\n212)—otherwise, an honest woman.\r\n\r\nIt is humanly probable that Duke Cesare was the son of Cardinal Giuliano\r\ndella Rovere by Madonna Giovanna de’ Catanei. He was born in 1474, “son\r\nof a cardinal bishop and a married woman.” The following year, 1475, the\r\nlady bore to Cardinal Rodrigo de Lançol y Borja, Don Juan Francisco; in\r\n1478, Madonna Lucrezia; in 1481, Don Gioffredo. It is as humanly natural\r\nthat, after the birth of Duke Cesare, Cardinal Rodrigo should win the\r\nmother from Cardinal Giuliano; as that in 1492 he should win the\r\nTriregno from him in full conclave. The two prelates were antipathetic\r\nfrom heel to crown. There was bound to be rivalry between them. The loss\r\nof the papal throne in 1492 would have embittered Cardinal Giuliano\r\ndella Rovere: but, by itself, hardly could have imparted that virulent\r\nvicious smack to his revenge that made him agonize, during twenty years,\r\nto dispossess and grind to powder the House of Borgia. The introduction\r\nof the feminine element provides a key to the enigma of that pettiness.\r\n\r\nThe narration of Varillas, therefore, deserves consideration as a\r\ncontribution to the solving of the mysteries of the unquenchable hatred\r\nof Dellarovere for Borgia, and of Duke Cesare’s relations with the Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI.\r\n\r\nWhatever the truth may be, it is circumstantially evident that to Duke\r\nCesare de Valentinois della Romagna, his advocacy or neutrality, his\r\ninfluence exercised or his abstention from opposition, Cardinal Giuliano\r\ndella Rovere owed his election in the Conclave of November 1503. He\r\nchose to be called the Lord Julius P.P. II.; and He instantly set about\r\nthe ruin of the House of Borgia.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe three Borgia cardinals naturally did not vote for Cardinal Giuliano\r\ndella Rovere. Cardinal Luis Juan de Mila y Borja did not deign to attend\r\nthe Conclave: but remained at his bishopric of Lerida in Spain. Cardinal\r\nPedro Luis de Lançol y Borja, immediately after the election, passed\r\ninto voluntary exile in the Regno without speaking to the Pope. Cardinal\r\nFrancisco de Borja followed the custom of his House in regard to the\r\nvoting: but he remained in Rome; and no doubt hoped with his charming\r\ninnocent good nature that the Lord Julius P.P. would be satisfied, would\r\nbe appeased, now that the world had nothing more to give Him. The\r\nCardinal was bitterly disappointed.\r\n\r\nFrom Madonna Lucrezia’s little boy, Duke Roderico, His Holiness seized\r\nthe duchy of Sermoneta; and restored it to the Caïetani from whom it\r\noriginally had been taken, and who hold it still, A.D. 1901. (The\r\npresent Duke of Sermoneta also has the superb sword of state which\r\nMaestro Ercole, the master-sword-smith of his age, had made to carry\r\nbefore Duke Cesare (detto Borgia) when he officiated as Cardinal\r\nAblegate at the coronation of King Don Federigo of Naples in 1497. It is\r\na miracle of damascening and design, a lesson to Twentieth Century\r\nmakers of decorative swords who heap glories on hilt and scabbard, and\r\nleave the blade to be hidden. Of this sword of Duke Cesare’s the blade\r\nis the soul. The sheath of plain embossed leather is in the Victoria and\r\nAlbert Museum.)\r\n\r\nThen, the Lord Julius P.P. II demanded of Duke Cesare the renunciation\r\nof his duchy of the Romagna. That province was a fief of the Holy See;\r\nand it was competent for the Holiness of the Pope to deal with it at His\r\npleasure: but, seeing that to Duke Cesare’s splendid services, the\r\nPapacy practically owed the peace, the possession, the heftiness of the\r\nRomagna, heretofore a hell of turbulent bandits, brigands and assassins\r\nwho defied their Over-lord to collect His revenues,—the demand of the\r\nLord Julius P.P. II at least was discouraging.\r\n\r\nDuke Cesare, while willing to take the oath of allegiance of a feudal\r\nvassal to the Prince, refused to relinquish the fortresses of the\r\nRomagna which by conquest he had won, and garrisoned with his veteran\r\narmy, now disbanded by the Judas wiles of Cardinal Giuliano della\r\nRovere, and re-enlisted under alien banners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Julius P.P. II._]\r\n\r\nWhether the Lord Julius P.P. II had made, or had not made, promises\r\nbefore His election, He was now _de iure_ and _de facto_ Ruler of the\r\nWorld, and absolutely despotic. He arrested Duke Cesare in Rome; and\r\nimprisoned him as a rebel in the Borgia Tower. The utter and vacuous\r\nhelplessness of the Duke is in striking contrast to the masterful energy\r\nof all his previous life. Some enormous mental shock might produce such\r\ndegeneration; the hideous treachery of Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere as\r\nrelated by Varillas, for example. Duke Cesare behaved, in his\r\nmisfortune, like a son staggered, struck breathless and speechless by a\r\nrevelation of a father’s iniquity. A Bull of Deprivation despoiled him\r\nof all fiefs and dignities held from the Holy See, and confiscated all\r\nhis personal property. He literally was stripped naked. In 1504, he\r\nescaped from Rome to Ostia in disguise, and thence to Naples. Here he\r\nmight have found a pied à terre; and, with the splendour of his past\r\nachievements, have won an opportunity of recovering his lost estates by\r\nwar: but the Lord Julius P.P. II, conscious of the danger to His peace\r\nthat such an aggrieved and notable personality would be, had intrigued\r\nwith the Catholic King; and, on Duke Cesare’s arrival in the Regno, he\r\nwas re-arrested, and shipped to a new prison in the castle of Medina del\r\nCampo in Spain.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Madonna Lucrezia Borgia with Don Alfonso d’Este was a\r\nmost happy one. The sweet young bride had made herself beloved by all\r\nFerrara, from her husband’s father Duke Ercole to the meanest of his\r\nsubjects, by her beauty, her goodness, and her wonderfully able\r\nversatility, three indispensable qualities in the wife of the heir to\r\nthe throne. Attired in “a mulberry satin gown embroidered with gold\r\nfish-bones each two fingers broad,” with the lace-flounce worth thirty\r\nthousand ducats (say £60,000) which, according to Giovanni Lucido, was\r\nin her wedding-chest, she would amuse herself in the ducal palace by\r\nwitnessing performances of the _Casina_ or the _Miles Gloriosus_,\r\ncomedies of Plautus. Sometimes, (as Sanuto, the Venetian Orator at\r\nFerrara, informed his government,) she would remain all day in her\r\napartments, writing letters, and having her head washed: or she would\r\nsit for hours and listen to the violin-music of her adept young husband.\r\nOn the Maundy Thursday of the first year of her marriage, she publicly\r\nwashed the feet of one hundred and sixty poor men. Her observance of\r\nreligious duties was as notable as the spirit of genuine piety which\r\npervades her many letters still extant.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of Duke Cesare’s _disgrazia_, Madonna Lucrezia earnestly\r\nwrote to the Marquess of Mantua, and to her friend, sister-in-law, and\r\nconfidante, the Marchioness Isabella, begging them to use the influence\r\nof their House of Gonzaga with the Lord Julius P.P. II to procure his\r\nfreedom. The times were out of joint for Este personally to interfere;\r\nfor Madonna Lucrezia was stricken down with the effects of an ἄμβλωσις,\r\nand the old Duke Ercole was breathing his last sigh.\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth of January 1505, the Lord Julius P.P. II issued His\r\nnotorious Bull against Simony; striking a new blow at the House of\r\nBorgia, by the aspersion cast upon the memory of the Lord Alexander P.P.\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nDuke Alfonso d’Este and his Duchess Lucrezia ascended the throne of\r\ntheir duchy in due course; and negotiations with the Holiness of the\r\nPope, for the enfranchisement of Duke Cesare, might have been, and would\r\nhave been instituted: but, early in the spring of the year Ferrara was\r\nthreatened by famine, and the hands of the young sovereigns were\r\nentirely occupied. Had Duke Cesare been own brother to the Duchess\r\nLucrezia, perhaps more urgent steps would have been taken: but she never\r\nseems to have regarded him otherwise than as a half-brother, who was her\r\nFather’s most useful servant, and her mother’s shame. Duke Alfonso\r\nproceeded to Venice to buy food stuffs in view of the famine, for the\r\npatriarchal rule obtained in Ferrara; and left the Duchess Lucrezia as\r\nRegent of his state. Her lovely womanly character may be seen in an\r\nedict which she issued for the protection of Jews, who were attacked and\r\npillaged by Christians rioting for food; and in the sweet indignant\r\nletter, abounding in mis-spelt words (as do all good and distinguished\r\nwomen’s letters,) and enjoining the Podesta (mayor) to be energetic\r\nabout securing to the Jews protection of their lives and property\r\nequally with the Christians.\r\n\r\nWhen Duke Alfonso returned, after some months’ absence during which the\r\nDuchess sent him periodical and frequent accounts of her regency,\r\naddressed “To the Most Illustrious and Most Excellent Lord, My Most\r\nHonourable Lord and Consort, These, with speed—speed—speed—” the summer\r\nbrought plague on the heels of famine. The visitation was most severe.\r\nThe unselfish exertions of the Duke and Duchess were noble and untiring.\r\nThe health of the Duchess Lucrezia suffered; and before the year was\r\nover she gave birth to a dead child.\r\n\r\nIn 1506, Duke Cesare de Valentinois escaped from his Spanish prison, and\r\nmade his way into the neighbouring realm of Navarre, where the King Jean\r\nd’Albret was brother to his wife Madame Charlotte d’Albret, Duchess of\r\nValentinois. The events of the last three years had not broken his\r\nsplendid spirit. All his triumphs, all the results of his strenuous\r\nenergy and talent had been nullified for him. At the age of thirty-three\r\nyears he was despoiled of his life’s work, and was a ruined man. The\r\nRomagna for ever was gone from him. His French duchy seems to have been\r\nof small account. Still, he was not crushed, he had the courage to begin\r\nagain to carve out a career in a new country; and to this end he took\r\nservice in the army of his brother-in law King Jean of Navarre.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Lord Julius P.P. II having decreed Himself and His Successors to be\r\nthe heir-at-law, next-of-kin, residuary and sole legatee, of all\r\ncardinals, and of all clergy who die within the walls of Rome, an era of\r\nsumptuous premortal cenotaphs and sepulchres set in among the\r\nIllustrissimi Colendissimi ed Osservantissimi Porporati, as well as\r\namong the lesser ecclesiastical dignitaries; to the end that as little\r\nas possible of their riches, after their demise, should go to the\r\npontifical exchequer.\r\n\r\nThere is a codicil to the will of the Genoese mariner, Messer Cristoforo\r\nColombi of this date, the fourth of May 1506, by which the Inventor of\r\nAmerica bequeathed to his native Republic of Genoa “the prayer-book\r\nwhich Pope Alexander gave him; and which, in prison, in conflict, and in\r\nevery kind of adversity, had been to him the greatest of comforts.” How\r\nsimply bright a light does this incident throw upon the relations of a\r\ngreat and good man with the Lord Alexander P.P. VI!\r\n\r\nThe Lord Julius P.P. II was capable of doing without Duke Cesare in the\r\nRomagna. The Pope’s Holiness Himself was a man of war, Who found it\r\nconsistent to wear cuirass and casque on battlefields equally with\r\npluviale and triregno in the Vatican Basilica. Men called Him _Il\r\nPontifice Terribile_. “Give Us in Our hands no stupid book, but a bare\r\nblade,” He impatiently roared to the painter of His portrait, now in the\r\nNational Gallery. But Messer Rafaele Sanzio, despite all his\r\nconventional macaronics, was for once in his life artist enough to omit\r\nboth book and blade, and to concentrate on the painting of the character\r\nof those fierce vulgar insatiable empty hands gripping the arms of the\r\nchair. And the Romagna found the whips of Duke Cesare to be preferred\r\nbefore the scorpions of the Lord Julius P.P. II. Perugia was the seat of\r\nthe Baglioni. Twenty years before, in 1487, there had been an outbreak\r\nof the feud of Baglioni and Oddi, months of continual rioting, the\r\ngutters running blood, the city like a slaughterhouse; until Oddi was\r\ndriven away, and Baglioni turned the place into a fortress and the\r\nchurches into barracks. In 1491, in another outbreak, Baglioni hanged a\r\nhundred and thirty conspirators from the windows of the Palazzo\r\nCommunale in a single day; and, (with the quick reversion from carnage\r\nto piety which is a characteristic of the age,) incontinently erected\r\nfive and thirty altars in the public square, and caused continuous\r\nmasses to be said and processions to be performed, to purify the city\r\nand to procure repose for the souls of the slain. Duke Cesare made a\r\nmarked impression on these brigands, who learned to give him little\r\ntrouble: but, when he was dispossessed and his long sword sealed in its\r\nscabbard, Baglioni took the bit between their teeth and reared, refused\r\ntribute to their sovereign Over-lord, and broke out in rebellion in the\r\ncustomary manner. The Lord Julius P.P. II promptly raised an army which\r\nHe led in person; and reduced Perugia. Without precautions for His\r\nsafety, trusting to the moral effect of His presence for the\r\ninviolability of His sacrosanct person, He adventured Himself in the\r\nheart of the rebel city, and beat Don Giampaolo Baglioni to his knees.\r\nIn a man of sensibility this hardihood would indicate a very dare-devil:\r\nin the case of the Supreme Pontiff a distinction must be made between\r\ncourage and mere plebeian callousness. Messer Niccolo Machiavelli\r\nsneered at this miserable Don Giampaolo Baglioni, because he lacked the\r\nboldness to strangle his unwelcome visitor, the Lord Julius P.P. II, and\r\nso crown his life of crime with a signal act of “Magnanimità”! Certainly\r\na man would need some boldness to strangle the Pope, the Ruler of the\r\nWorld, the Father of Princes and of Kings, the Earthly Vicar of Jesus\r\nChrist our Saviour! Certainly, a man who would strangle in cold blood\r\nthe Sovereign Pontiff coming to him as his guest, unarmed, under a flag\r\nof truce, would win fame, or infamy, for endless ages. But that such a\r\ndeed should deserve the epithet “magnanimous,” should be considered to\r\nbe indicative of greatness of soul, is a matter of opinion. Evidently\r\nthe Twentieth Century considerably has curtailed and straitened the\r\nsignification and the application which the word Magnanimity bore in the\r\nFifteenth. Now, we call a man magnanimous who, at huge self-sacrifice,\r\ndoes noble deeds. Then, Messer Niccolo Machiavelli thought that\r\nstartling actions, good, or bad, proclaimed the greatness of their\r\nagent’s soul!\r\n\r\nThe Lord Julius P.P. II was not without His flatterers. No man is, if he\r\ncan pay. Literary petits maîtres like Messer Baltassare Castiglioni\r\nfound it profitable to address the Terrible Pontiff in terms like these:\r\n\r\n “O Pater, O Pastor populorum, O     “O Father, O Shepherd of the\r\n   Maxime mundi                        people, O Supreme\r\n Arbiter, humanum qui genus omne     Master of the world, Who rulest all\r\n   regis;                              the human race;\r\n Iustitiae pacisque Dator            Giver of Justice, Peace, and\r\n   placidaeque quietis,                tranquil Ease,\r\n Credita Cui soli est vita salusque  Thou to Whom alone is committed the\r\n   hominum;                            life and salvation of men;\r\n Quem Deus Ipse Erebi fecit caelique Whom God Himself has made Lord of\r\n   potentem,                           heaven and hell,\r\n Ut nutu pateant utraque regno Tuo;— That either realm might open at Thy\r\n                                       nod—\r\n\r\n  “When the spiritual authority of the Popes came thus to be expressed\r\n  in Latin verse, it was impossible not to treat them as deities. The\r\n  temptation to apply to them the language of Roman religion was too\r\n  great; the double opportunity of flattering their vanity as pontiffs,\r\n  and their ears as scholars, was too attractive to be missed.”[86]\r\n\r\nThe Terrible Pontiff, however, was no scholar, but an unadulterated\r\nplebeian. It is true that He, as Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia, bought that\r\nvastly over-rated piece known as the Apollo of the Belvedere, when first\r\nit was discovered at Porto d’Anzio (Antium). It is true that He bought,\r\nin 1506, for six hundred gold crowns (?) the Laocoon, (which Messer\r\nMichelangelo Buonarroti saw unearthed in the Baths of Titus,) to the\r\nsupreme disgust of his “art-adviser” who declared that the two sons of\r\nthe Thymbraian priest were not boys, but little men. It is true that He\r\nbought the Ariadne (which He called Cleopatra), the Torso of Herakles,\r\nand the Commodus, unearthed on Campo di Fiori, and now in the Vatican.\r\nHe did these things because they were modish things to do in 1506. One\r\ngained more κῦδος in the pose of a Sixteenth Century Maecenas, than as\r\nSuccessor of the Galilean Fisherman. The plebeian pontiff of the\r\nSixteenth Century was ashamed of His plebeian predecessor of the First.\r\nThe times were changed, he argued, as the faithful vainly argue to\r\nexcuse prelatical vagaries now. He preferred competition with “men of\r\nthe world” to the cure of souls. He was quite unable to appreciate\r\nintellect. He was congenitally incapable of appreciating the delicacy,\r\nor the validity, of Letters. The plebeian chiefly is touched by way of\r\nthe sense of sight; and the Lord Julius P.P. II understood naked\r\nstatues, things which He could see: wherefore He bought Apollo and\r\nLaocoon and the rest. There is not the slightest credit due to Him for\r\ndiscrimination in His purchases, or for a deliberate choice of what was\r\nbeautiful. Men happened to dig up those marbles in Roman territory just\r\nthen. Any one could see them to be beyond the ordinary. Any one could\r\nsee them to be antiques. It was the fashion to buy antiques; and the\r\nTerrible Pontiff bought—bought as retired grocers buy, who buy their\r\nlibraries by the cwt. Also, He had Messer Michelangelo Buonarroti at His\r\nankle, with whose advice it would have been difficult for a sardonic\r\ngoat to commit an artistic blunder. They were a pair, those two, the\r\nartist and the pontiff, _uomini terribili_, terrible men, both. Messer\r\nMichelangelo had been educated at the expense of Lorenzo de’ Medici in\r\nthe Palazzo Medici of Florence and the Villa Medici of Fiesole. There,\r\nat the suggestion of Canon Angelo Ambrogini (detto Poliziano), he had\r\nsculptured his Battle of Herakles with the Centaurs, while listening to\r\nFra Girolamo Savonarola and Messer Giovanni Pico della Mirandola\r\nsurnamed the Phoenix of Genius (_Fenice degli iugegni_.) Could any man\r\nbut Poliziano have suggested a more admirable subject for Michelangelo\r\nthan this of weird muscular gigantic energy? In 1500, in the reign of\r\nthe Lord Alexander P.P. VI, he had carved his lily-pure Pietà of the\r\nVatican Basilica, the most divinely pure presentment of God’s Maiden\r\nMother, of the Μητροπάρθενος, save those of Alessandro Filipepi (detto\r\nBotticelli) since Byzantine art had faded. Now, he was in Rome,\r\n“art-adviser” to the Terrible Pontiff, eating his own heart in\r\ninactivity, burning and yearning to work with his own hands, with all\r\nthe passionate excruciating torture suffered by every artist who may not\r\nput his talent “out to the exchangers.” It was the lust of creation in\r\nMichelangelo that made him terrible to his fellow men. His incivilities\r\nto his colleagues are proverbial. “Goffo nell’ arte” he flung with\r\ncontemptuous scorn to Messer Pietro di Cristoforo Vanucci of città della\r\nPieve (detto Perugino) who had a picture-shop at Florence, and bought\r\nestates with the proceeds of his smooth and stony saints and seraphs,\r\nstencilled by his pupils on the canvases, and touched by himself in his\r\nworkshop or picture-factory at Perugia, at the very time when Oddi and\r\nBaglioni each were tearing the other’s throats to tatters outside his\r\ndoor. Then in 1508 the Lord Julius P.P. II ordered Messer Michelangelo\r\nto paint the ceiling of the Xystine Chapel. The gods on high Olympos\r\nnever allow a man to do the thing that he wants to do: they are jealous\r\nlest a man should create a god. Messer Michelangelo wanted to practise\r\nsculpture; wherefore he was told to paint a ceiling. “I’m not a\r\npainter!” (Nè io pittore!) he roared to the Terrible Pontiff, who\r\nfulminated and thundered in reply. They both were terrible men; and they\r\nunrestrainedly spoke with perfect frankness as between man and man,\r\nusing no set form whatever.\r\n\r\nThe Terrible Pontiff, like all clerical patrons, was an infernal\r\nnuisance to the Terrible Painter, who well-nigh killed himself by years\r\nof ceaseless toil, lying on his back upon a scaffold in the filthy air\r\nthat hangs about a ceiling. He would have no assistant save a boy or\r\ntwo. He lived, and ate, and slept on the scene of his labour. Many times\r\nthe Terrible Pontiff came to see what was being done; and every time the\r\nTerrible Painter instructed Him in the art and mystery of anathema, and\r\ndrove Him away. At last the Lord Julius P.P. II threatened to have\r\nMesser Michelangelo flung down, and the scaffold pulled about his ears:\r\nbut this was when the work was done. The Terrible Painter had the\r\nscaffold removed, and invited his patron to view the sumptuous ceiling.\r\nThe Terrible Pontiff came; and saw; and suggested that the scaffold\r\nshould be reerected so that the work might be touched up\r\nwith—ultramarine and gold-leaf!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Ferrara, the year 1506 was marked by one of those tragical\r\nexpositions of naked human passion which afflict humanity in every age.\r\nMadonna Angela de Borja y Lançol, a cousin of the Duchess Lucrezia—being\r\nthe daughter of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI’s sister, Doña Juana, by her\r\nmarriage with Don Guillelmo de Lançol, and sister to Cardinal Juan de\r\nBorja y Lançol (detto Giovanni Seniore), Archbishop of Monreale, and\r\nCardinal Pedro Luis de Borja y Lançol,—was a maid-of-honour attached to\r\nthe suite of the Duchess of Ferrara. She was very beautiful, and is\r\ncalled in the chronicle “a most elegant damsel”—_damigella\r\nelegantissima_. Two younger brothers of Duke Alfonso, the athletic\r\nCardinal Ippolito d’Este, and Don Giulio d’Este (bastard of the old Duke\r\nErcole) fell in love with her. Madonna Angela favoured the Bastard\r\nGiulio whose lovely eyes she unreservedly admired—consequently, as the\r\nmanner was, his rival the Cardinal hired four professionals to put out\r\nthose eyes. Naif unpaltering straightforwardness of the Sixteenth\r\nCentury! The operation failed of execution, for the Bastard Giulio,\r\nbeing forewarned, escaped with his eyes unharmed. But such conduct does\r\nnot make for the peace of a state, brawling royalties affording\r\ndisedification to the mob. The laws of Ferrara, paternal in character,\r\nordained a scale of penances graduated to the rank of culprits: for\r\nexample, a working man, who obscenely swore, would pay a fine; a\r\nswearing burgess paid a double fine and a swearing noble was mulcted of\r\na triple fine. Therefore Duke Alfonso put the ban on his brother, the\r\nLord Cardinal Ippolito, who retired to Rome to nurse his discontent and\r\nplan his next move against the Bastard Giulio. Madonna Angela, who was\r\nno more to be blamed than any other girl whose charms have inflamed a\r\nlusty pair of rivals to desperation, married the third, Don Alessandro\r\nPio Estense di Savoja, Count of Sassuolo. The bandit[87] Cardinal\r\nIppolito had not long to wait in exile. If he had been the Master of\r\nFate, he could not have devised a neater or completer vengeance than\r\nthat which came to him. It is one thing to attempt to blind a bastard\r\nbrother who is a royal prince. It is another thing to compass the death\r\nof a brother who is a reigning sovereign. The robust young Cardinal was\r\nequal to the first: but above the second.\r\n\r\nDuke Alfonso’s brothers, Don Ferdinando d’Este and the Bastard Giulio,\r\nengaged in a conspiracy to assassinate him. News of the plot reached\r\nCardinal Ippolito in Rome. He promptly warned Duke Alfonso of his\r\ndanger. Finding themselves discovered, the conspirators fled. Don\r\nFerdinando was caught: but the Bastard Giulio, good at escapes, took\r\nrefuge in sanctuary with his brother-in-law the Marquess of Mantua, who\r\nreplied to Duke Alfonso’s demand for extradition that, if evidence of\r\nguilt were shewn, the criminal should be delivered up to justice.\r\nEvidence was shewn, in the shape of the full confession of Don\r\nFerdinando; and the Bastard Giulio passed into his sovereign brother’s\r\nhands. Brought to the common block in the square of Ferrara, the two\r\ndetected traitors were allowed to suffer all the pangs of the approach\r\nof death: but, at the last moment, Duke Alfonso in his mercy granted a\r\nreprieve, commuting their penance to life-imprisonment.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarly in 1507, died Duke Cesare de Valentinois (detto Borgia), by a mean\r\ninglorious death for one who had been in life so mighty a man. While\r\ncommanding a small squadron on behalf of the King of Navarre, he was\r\nkilled in a petty skirmish by the castle of Viana. His corpse was\r\nquietly interred in the cathedral of Pampeluna, which, by a curious\r\ncoincidence, had been the first piece of ecclesiastical preferment\r\nconferred on him by the Lord Alexander P.P. VI. So ended a phenomenal\r\npersonality in which superb and tawny beauty of physique, prodigious\r\nforce of character, fierce all-conquering energy, swift unerring\r\nalmost-feline agility of action, and transcendent splendour of\r\nachievement, were blasted and nullified and marred, humanly speaking, by\r\none single delicacy of respectful conscientious self-sacrifice and\r\nsupreme confidence in clerical honour. His beautiful elegy by Ercole\r\nStrozzi,\r\n\r\n            “Ille diu, qui dum caelestibus auris\r\n            Visitur, implet onus laudis, caelumque meretur”\r\n\r\nis too well-known to be quoted at length. He left three children,\r\n\r\n  (α) Madame Eloise de Valentinois; who married, first, the Sieur Louis\r\n        de la Tremouille, second, the Sieur Philippe de Bourbon, Comte\r\n        de Busset, whose direct descendants flourish in France at the\r\n        present day:\r\n\r\n  (β) Don Girolamo de Valentinois; who, by marriage with Madonna\r\n        Isabella Carpi patrician of Ferrara, had issue Madonna Lucrezia\r\n        de Valentinois married, in 1562, to Don Bartolomeo Oroboni\r\n        patrician of Ferrara, who died in 1565.\r\n\r\n  (γ) a bastard Madonna Camilla Lucrezia; (evidently the offspring of an\r\n        intrigue carried on when Duke Cesare was in Ferrara in 1500–1\r\n        arranging the marriage of Madonna Lucrezia Borgia to the heir of\r\n        Duke Ercole d’Este;) born of Duke Cesare and a married woman in\r\n        Ferrara; according to the deed of legitimation,[88] dated 1509,\r\n        where Madonna Camilla Lucrezia is said to be “of the age of more\r\n        than seven years”: she became Abbess of San Bernardino in\r\n        Ferrara, in 1545; and died in 1573.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess Lucrezia Borgia d’Este was deeply grieved by the death of\r\nDuke Cesare her half-brother. There is a very touching letter written by\r\nher friend and sister-in-law, the Marchioness Isabella Gonzaga of\r\nMantua, to Duke Alfonso who at that time was in Rome. It is dated the\r\neighteenth of April 1507; and describes how that the Duchess of Ferrara,\r\non receiving the sad news, immediately went to the church of the\r\nmonastery of Corpus Domini and remained during two days and nights,\r\npraying for the repose of the soul of Duke Cesare de Valentinois. A\r\nsimple act; and precisely what any good Christian woman would do in\r\nsimilar circumstances.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA year later, on the fourth of April 1508, at the Castle of Ferrara to\r\nthe immense joy of all, _formosus puer est formoso natus Aprili_, says\r\nBenedetto Lampridii in his Carmina Inedita, the Duchess Lucrezia bore to\r\nDuke Alfonso a son and heir, who was baptized by the name Ercole.\r\n\r\nDuring this year, a league of the Powers was formed under the\r\nElect-Emperor Maximilian directed against Venice; and Duke Alfonso,\r\nwhose dominions marched with those of that Republic, threw in his lot\r\nwith its foes. While he was engaging the Venetians on the Romagna\r\nfrontier, the Duchess Lucrezia ruled as Regent in Ferrara. She\r\nadministered government of the state with the same sweet womanly\r\nthoroughness as she shewed in the administration of the government of\r\nher domestic affairs. History is rich in records relating to this lovely\r\nlady. She superintended the household matters of her palaces with a\r\nminute attention to detail which, to the modern middle-classes, would\r\nappear amazing in a Sovereign Duchess. To set a fashion of rare\r\nliberal-mindedness she appointed the Jewess Mazzolino to the care of her\r\nextensive wardrobe, and Messer Ludovico as her physician. Her régime was\r\nof the simple patriarchal type of the old Duke Ercole, who, on the\r\noccasion of an outbreak of plague in 1500, issued an Edict which said\r\nthat “Duke Ercole d’Este, for good reasons to him known, _and because it\r\nalways is well to be on good terms with God_,” ordained religious\r\nprocessions every day throughout Ferrara. A second quaint Edict of the\r\nsame fatherly potentate, (which incidentally speaks for the meticulously\r\ncleanly personal habits of the Borgian Era, so strenuously maintained on\r\na previous page of this book,) proclaims that “inasmuch as bakers are\r\nknown to knead their dough with feet that, frequently, are unclean, such\r\npractices must not continue except on penalty of fine or imprisonment:\r\nbut the dough must be worked with clean hands _and nails_.”\r\n\r\nEvildoers, all the same, had a shocking time. Maria Equicola gives exact\r\nparticulars of a certain Madonna Laura (name suppressed) who, being\r\ncaught in adultery, was immured alive; that is to say, she was publicly\r\nconfined in a cell a few feet square, with a little window, outside the\r\nepiscopal palace, near the entrance on the right of the high altar of\r\nthe cathedral of Ferrara. Perjurers went about after their conviction\r\nwith their tongues securely nailed to little logs of wood. The accounts\r\nfor the nails and logs exist. Duchess Lucrezia’s sumptuary laws were\r\nunsuccessful. The sex of the legislator prevented her from manufacturing\r\nlaws to regulate fashion, which could be put into practical effect. That\r\nwas perfectly natural; nor does the failure in any way reflect upon the\r\nexcellence of the intentions of her ducal highness. She ordained that no\r\nwoman should wear a gown whose value was higher than the sum of fifteen\r\nducats (say £30), nor jewellery worth more than fifty ducats (say £100).\r\nShe furnished a specification of the gems which might be worn, and of\r\nthe fabrics of which gowns might be made. Also, she precisely specified\r\nthe quantity of material that might be used, and the cut and fashion\r\nthat was to be adopted. Further, in order to secure the observation of\r\nthese laws, she ordained a box, having a slit in its lid like a modern\r\nletter-box, to be placed in the cathedral by the holy water-stoup; so\r\nthat fathers, husbands, or lovers, who found themselves outraged by the\r\nlength or the rotundity of the skirts, or the bulk of the sleeves, or\r\nthe violence of the style of their women-folk,—and the cost of the\r\nsame,—secretly might drop in denunciations while in the act of taking\r\nholy water; the said denunciations afterwards to be attended-to in a\r\nlegal manner by the justiciary. Delightfully solemn and futile effort of\r\na charming woman. Well, it failed; not on account of the female peacocks\r\nof Ferrara, but by reason of the very skewbald harlequins whose\r\npropriety and purses it had aimed to benefit. How many denunciations\r\nsecretly were dropped into Duchess Lucrezia’s precious box, how many\r\nscandalized fathers, husbands, and lovers, sneaked about their\r\ndaughters, wives, and lemans, is not known. Only one thing is\r\nknown,—there was not a justiciar in all the duchy of Ferrara, married or\r\nunmarried, who dared even to allude to, much less to act upon, the said\r\ndenunciations, and enforce the law.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fifth of August 1509, the Duchess Lucrezia gave birth to a\r\nsecond son, Don Ippolito d’Este, named after his uncle the heraklean\r\nCardinal; and who, in after years, became Archbishop and Cardinal of\r\nMilan.\r\n\r\nAll through 1508 and 1509 the war went on. In December of the latter\r\nyear, a powerful Venetian fleet advanced to the mouth of the Po,\r\ndevastating the country on both banks, and invading the duchy of Ferrara\r\nwith frightful atrocities. Duke Alfonso, hurrying to meet the foe, won a\r\nglorious victory at Policella: but the war dragged on till 1512, keeping\r\nhim in camp, away from his capital, which almost exclusively was\r\ngoverned by the Duchess Lucrezia (she bore Don Alessandro d’Este in\r\n1511), assisted by Cardinal Ippolito d’Este, now no longer a bandit, but\r\ncompletely in the confidence and favour of his sovereign brother.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the fifth of February 1510 died the noble and strenuous knight Don\r\nPietro Gregorio Borgia of the Junior Branch. He had been high in honour\r\nwith Duke Cesare de Valentinois della Romagna since he saved him from\r\nthe clutches of the Christian King Charles VIII in 1495; and had served\r\nhim as mounted scale-armoured arbalister, lieutenant, and\r\nstandard-bearer. On the fall of the Duke, he returned to his allegiance\r\nto the Regno now ruled by the Catholic King Don Hernando. He was Viceroy\r\nof the province of the Abruzzi when he died, and was buried in the\r\nChurch of San Clemente at Velletri, his native city.[89] His fine\r\nepitaph[90] runs:\r\n\r\n  “HIC REQUIESCIT NOB. ET STRENUUS EQUES DOM. PETRUS BORGIA,\r\n  CATAPHRACTOR. LOCUM-TENENS, AC SIGNIFER CESARIS BORGIAE ISPANI\r\n  VALENTINI DUCIS, QUI OBJIT AN. DNI. MDX. D. QV. MEN. FEB.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe year 1511 is remarkable for a wildly frenetic insurrection on the\r\npart of the gentle old Cardinal Francisco de Borja, which cost that Most\r\nWorshipful Lord his rank and his life. There is a limit to human\r\nendurance. In some men it is wide; in others narrow: but human nature\r\nsubjected to unnatural suppression and restraint, sooner or later\r\ndesperately will struggle to burst its bonds. This principle has never\r\nbeen understood by the clergy. It is one of the disabilities under which\r\nthey labour in dealing with men. History teems with examples of amiable,\r\nwould-be obedient, and respectable characters, tried beyond their\r\nstrength by inconsiderate ignorant oppressive injustice on the part of\r\nchurchmen, and transformed into savagely bitter and appallingly\r\ndestructive suicides. There is no better example than Cardinal Francisco\r\nde Borja.\r\n\r\nHe was of the age of seventy years. Though his illustrious House had\r\nbeen predominant in Christendom during more than fifty of those years,\r\nhe had never sought to benefit by the fact that his father was the Lord\r\nCalixtus P.P. III, nor to intrude himself among the mighty who were his\r\nblood-relations. Not till he was on the verge of his sixtieth year did\r\nhe become a personage; and then his august cousin, the Lord Alexander\r\nP.P. VI, in admiration of his enchanting disposition, dignified him with\r\nthe scarlet hat and the rank of Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa\r\nLucia _in Silice_, (_Atti Consistoriali_). Later, he proceeded to the\r\nTitle of Santa Cecilia, (_Ciacconi_ and _Moroni_); thence again to the\r\nTitle of San Nereo e Sant’ Achilleo (_Atti Consistoriali_); and last to\r\nthe Title of San Clemente. He also was Treasurer of the Holy See, Bishop\r\nof Teano, and Archbishop of Cosenza.\r\n\r\nSeeing the exacerbating measures which the Terrible Pontiff, the Lord\r\nJulius P.P. II was using against the House of Borgia, and especially the\r\nspoliation of the two little boys Duke Roderico and Duke Giovanni, this\r\nvery sympathetic old cardinal had the indiscretion to put his frank\r\nopinion of the Pope’s Holiness into certain letters which he wrote to\r\nthe Orator of Ferrara at the Court of Rome. This opinion could not fail\r\nto be unfavourable and the reverse of complimentary. No doubt the Orator\r\nwas in direct communication with his sovereign, Duke Alfonso d’Este,\r\nwhom he would keep advised of the trend of sentiments and of events in\r\nRome. These letters came, by means which it would be improper to\r\ndescribe, into the anointed hands of God’s Vicegerent. His Holiness read\r\nthem; and vehemently enraged himself against the Duke Alfonso d’Este of\r\nFerrara, and upon Cardinal Francisco de Borja, whom he incontinently\r\nflung into prison with every species of indignity. The Sacred College,\r\ntremorous for its own security if such treatment of a Purpled One should\r\npass without remonstrance, exerted its influence on the Holiness of the\r\nPope, and procured the ungracious liberation of Cardinal Francisco de\r\nBorja.\r\n\r\nBut the ill was done. The milk of human kindness effectually had been\r\nsoured; the placid amiable old gentleman had been changed into a violent\r\nmalcontent breathing threatenings and slaughter, and whose fiery Spanish\r\nblood at last was boiling over. Two other cardinals joined in his savage\r\nrevolt, the Lord Bernardino Lopez de Caravajal Cardinal-Bishop of\r\nSabina, and the Lord Guillaume de Briçonnet Cardinal-Bishop of Praeneste\r\n(Palestrina). These three decamped from Rome to Pisa, where, a fourth,\r\nthe Lord Réné de Prie Cardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Sabina,\r\nhaving joined them, they constituted themselves as a General Council;\r\nand dared to cite the Lord Julius P.P. II to shew cause before them why\r\nHe should not be declared a Pseudopontiff, and deposed from Peter’s\r\nThrone, by reason of the irregularity of His election due to Simony and\r\nother crimes:—an excellent example of the sauce for the goose being\r\nserved to the gander.\r\n\r\nMelpomene is own sister to Thalia; and never has a ghastlier tragedy\r\nbeen more comically played. This self-styled Council of Pisa laboured\r\nunder the disadvantage of being radically schismatic. Only the Roman\r\nPontiff can summon, or confirm the decrees of, a General Council. The\r\nacts of the Schismatic Council of Pisa, therefore, were hopelessly and\r\nirretrievably invalid. The very impossibility of the whole affair is\r\nproof conclusive that these four well-intentioned, well-living pathetic\r\nold men had been tried beyond their strength, beyond all patience,\r\ngoaded by insult and by gross injustice into frenzy. Their conduct was\r\nsimply frenetic.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Julius P.P. II replied to Cardinal Francisco de Borja with\r\nshort incisive action. By His supreme authority He issued a Bull of\r\nDeposition from the cardinalate; and denounced him to all Christendom as\r\nan heresiarch and schismatic with whom none might have to do. A Bull\r\n(Bulla Monitorii Apostolici) was issued on the twenty-eighth of July\r\n1511 “_cõtra tres reverendissimos cardinales ... ut redeãt ad obediẽtâ\r\nS.d.n. ne Schisma in eccl. in sancta dei oriẽt_.” This was followed by a\r\nsecond “_Bulla intimatiõis Generalis Concilii apud Lateranum per S.d.n.\r\nJuliũ Papâ II edita_,” directed, with the scrupulous politeness of a\r\ncleric about to crush, against “_dilectũ filiũ nostrũ Franciscũ Tituli\r\nSancti Clementis p̃byterum Cardinalem_”; who “_in seipsis armis\r\nassumptis et pro sacerdotalibus vestis Thorace[91] indutis et gladiis\r\narmati Papā se cõtulerãt_.” Printed contemporary copies of these two\r\nBulls are in the British Museum; and, bound with them, but, strange to\r\nsay, uncatalogued (A.D. 1900)—(strange, because of the unique perfection\r\nof everything at the British Museum)—is the momentous Brief announcing\r\nthe issue of the Bull of Deposition. Its title is “_Breve Julii Secũdi\r\nPont. Max. ad reges, duces, et principes christianos, etc._ “_Julius\r\nPapa II_” addresses Himself to\r\n\r\n “Our well-beloved son in Christ Maximilian, Elect-Emperor, Always\r\n                                   August;\r\n „              „         „      Louis (XII), of the French, the Most\r\n                                   Christian King;\r\n „              „         „      Hernando, of Aragon and the Two\r\n                                   Sicilies, the Catholic King;\r\n „              „         „      Emanuele, of Portugal, the Illustrious\r\n                                   King;\r\n „              „         „      Henry (VII), of England, the\r\n                                   Illustrious King;[92]\r\n „              „         „      James (V), of the Scots, the\r\n                                   Illustrious King;\r\n „              „         „      Wladislaf, of Hungary and Bohemia, the\r\n                                   Illustrious King;\r\n „              „         „      Jean and Katharine, King and Queen of\r\n                                   Navarre;\r\n „              „         „      Sigismund, King of Poland;\r\n „              „         „      John, King of Denmark;\r\n „              „         „      Carlo, Duke of Savoja;\r\n „              „         „      Lionardo Lauredano, Doge of Venice;”\r\n\r\nand proclaims that “this day, in Public Consistory, We have deprived” of\r\nall things ecclesiastical, and of the cardinalitial hat, (_galero\r\ncardinalatus_), Bernardino Cardinal-Bishop of Sabina, Guillaume\r\nCardinal-Bishop of Praeneste (Palestrina), Francisco Cardinal-Presbyter\r\nof the title of San Nereo e Sant’ Achilleo (a clerical error for his\r\nTitle, as given above in the Bull, was San Clemente), and Réné de Prie\r\nCardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Sabina, that they no longer may\r\nbe considered Cardinals, nor called Cardinals, by word or by writing.\r\nThe Brief is _Dated at Rome at St. Peters, and given Under the\r\nFisherman’s Ring, the twenty-fourth of October 1511 and the eighth year\r\nof Our Pontificate_. This summary is appended here as an example of\r\nform.\r\n\r\nDeath had hurled his dart before the Terrible Pontiff. Cardinal\r\nFrancisco de Borja died of an apoplexy at Pisa, before the sentence of\r\nhis disgrace and deposition reached him there.\r\n\r\nThe student of history, who seeks a field wherein few yet have walked,\r\nwill be well advised to investigate the life of this gentle and quiet\r\ncardinal, who departed in the tragic blaze of madness and revolt.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1512 death relieved the Lord Julius P.P. II of two more of the Borgia\r\nwhom He loathed: for there died in his Neapolitan exile the Most\r\nWorshipful Lord Pedro Luis de Lançol y Borja, Cardinal-Deacon of Santa\r\nMaria _in Via Lata_, Arch-presbyter of the Liberian Basilica (Santa\r\nMaria Maggiore), Abbot of San Simpliciano at Milan, and Archbishop of\r\nValencia in Spain. Having heard a rumour of the death of the Supreme\r\nPontiff, he was on the verge of returning to Rome for the Conclave; but\r\nhe was killed by falling from his mule at Naples, where he is buried in\r\nthe church of San Piercelestino without any memorial.\r\n\r\nThis year also died Don Roderico de Aragona e Borgia, at the age of\r\nthirteen years, the son of Madonna Lucrezia by her first legitimate\r\nmarriage with Don Alonso de Aragona Prince of Bisceglia. He had been\r\ndespoiled of his duchy of Sermoneta in favour of Caïetani by the Lord\r\nJulius P.P. II; and his existence as a step-son was embarrassing in\r\nFerrara, except to his mother, who most sincerely mourned him.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess Lucrezia was to suffer much this year. The Lord Julius P.P.\r\nII put the ban of Greater Excommunication upon her beloved husband Duke\r\nAlfonso. As the consort of a Borgia—a Borgia universally adored, a\r\nsovereign Borgia, a Borgia of unblemished character,—the Duke of Ferrara\r\nnaturally was intensely antipathetic to the Holiness of the Pope. If\r\nthat were not enough, the facts remained that Duke Alfonso was the\r\nfriend of France, (as the Supreme Pontiff’s predecessor also had been);\r\nand, he was cognizant of Cardinal Francisco’s disesteem for the Lord\r\nJulius P.P. II. Naturally the Pope’s Holiness found the Duke’s\r\nExcellency most annoying. The awful import of Excommunication barely can\r\nbe realized at the present time. People idly wonder why the\r\nexcommunicated take their case so seriously—why they do not turn to find\r\namusement, or satisfaction, in another channel,—why they persist in\r\nlying prone in the mire where the fulmination struck them. And, indeed,\r\nin modern times the formal sentence rarely is promulgated, and only\r\nagainst personages of distinction, like the German Dr. Döllinger or the\r\nSabaudo King Vittoremanuele II di Savoja, whose very circumstances\r\nprovided them with the means to allay the temporal irritation of the\r\nblow. There are excommunications “_gerendae_ sententiae” and “_latae_\r\nsententiae.” In the former, excommunication is threatened for some act:\r\nbut the offender must have sentence passed upon him. In the latter, the\r\noffender is excommunicate the moment he performs the act forbidden,\r\n(“ipso facto”). This however operates only “in foro _interno_,” and in\r\nthe Eyes of God. To make it effectual “in foro _externo_” it is\r\nnecessary that the guilt be proved and be declared to be so by some\r\n“competent judge.” Excommunication _latae sententiae_ appears not to\r\nhave been uncommon in the Victorian Era. A Leading Case occurred in\r\nDecember 1882, when it was enforced against a Scots clergyman on the\r\nstrength of the following letter:—\r\n\r\n                                               “ROME, _6 December 1882_.\r\n\r\n  “MY DEAR LORD ARCHBISHOP (of Saint Andrews and Edinburgh),—I have just\r\n  received a message from the Cardinal-Prefect (of Propaganda, Cardãl\r\n  Simeoni,) to tell your Grace ‘che il noto sacerdote il quale voleva\r\n  citare i Vescovi incorrerebbe senza dubbio la censura al primo atto\r\n  efficace che ponesse, ossia all’ atto della citazione, come _cogens\r\n  Ecclesiasticum ad tribunal laicum_. Se fosse ancora in tempo sarebbe\r\n  bene che l’Arcivescovo ne avvertisse il Sacerdote per distoglierlo da\r\n  tale atto.’\r\n\r\n                               “Yours very respectfully,\r\n                                               “F. A. CAMPBELL,\r\n                           “(then Rector of the Scots College of Rome.)”\r\n\r\nThe censure was Excommunicatio latae sententiae speciali modo reservatae\r\nRomano Pontifici. Bulla _Apostolicae Sedis. VII_.[93] Seldom does a case\r\nof Excommunication terminate in a perridiculous collapse, as this one\r\ndid, when the Cardinal-Prefect denied having sent the quoted message.\r\nSeldom, on the whole, is Excommunication _latae sententiae_ made\r\neffectual by proof of guilt and declaration of proof of guilt by a\r\ncompetent judge. The effect can be produced in another and far more\r\nexitial way. Simple secret instructions, or even hints, can be given by\r\nbishops to clergy, or adverse opinions can be expressed by one clerk to\r\nanother, suggesting that it would be well (that it would tend ad majorem\r\nDei gloriam, some say,) to obstruct the worldly welfare of such and such\r\nan one, to refuse him his rites and sacraments, or at least to offer the\r\nlast upon such conditions as the “proper pride” in human nature will\r\ndisdain to accept. This mode is purely devilish. It is capable of abuse\r\nby unworthy clerks for personal ends. It admits of no defence, of no\r\nappeal, of no redress, by the very reason of its intangibility. It\r\nconstricts a man in phantom folds. It blanches him with venomous breath.\r\nThe world, ever ready to pity some obscene dog who manifests his pain,\r\nhere sees nothing save one bruised and broken; desperately digladiant,\r\nstruggling with some invisible (and therefore incredible) foe. The\r\ncivilized world goes in terror of the invisible; goes by “on the other\r\nside.” Excommunication of any kind is a fearsome thing for him to whom\r\nthe Faith once delivered to the saints is the only prize worth having.\r\nTo the man who, in defect of spiritual advice, is convinced of his own\r\nintegrity, to whom the sacraments are as “odorifera panacea,”[94] to\r\nwhom the sacraments are the only means which keep him from Despair,\r\ntheir deprivation, by the revenge of a personal enemy, of an offended\r\nvanity abasing spiritual powers to satiate secular ambition, signifies\r\nthat, for the excommunicate, the light goes out of life, love is\r\neradicated from the heart, confidence in man is killed, hope is banished\r\nfrom death. Sympathy he may have from aliens, if he can humiliate\r\nhimself to expose his grievous wounds: but he may have it only at a\r\nprice which in honour he cannot pay—the price of insincerity to his\r\nconvictions—the price of apostasy. The dire Ban of excommunication,\r\nformal or informal, drives a man wild; turns his hand against every man,\r\nand every man’s hand against him; he is savage; he is a Bandit, actually\r\nand literally. Sometimes he becomes criminal. Ostracism practised is a\r\nschool for scoundrels. Far more merciful—divinely merciful, not\r\nhumanly—it would be to slay outright the body; than to doom a soul to\r\nlive a solivagous life of torture—the torture of Hopelessness. That is\r\nwhy Excommunication is so horrible in this present age of works. That is\r\nwhy it was so trenchant a weapon in the ages of faith. It was, and is,\r\nperfectly impossible to be resisted by one who is, and was, sincerely\r\nfaithful. Often enough, an excommunicate sovereign would try resistance;\r\nfor sovereigns are stronger than ordinary plebeians in the matter of\r\nresources. Then, when an interval for consideration had elapsed, the\r\nsecond blow of the Flail would fall—Interdict: his demesne would be made\r\nto suffer loss of the means of grace, the sacraments, which were denied\r\nto him. His subjects generally rose, resentful and revolting. There was\r\nno reason why they should be afflicted, when submission of their\r\nsovereign to God’s Vicegerent would suffice for their enfranchisement.\r\nBut sometimes Interdict also failed. The third blow came. Subjects were\r\nabsolved from their oath of allegiance to the excommunicate; his throne\r\nwas declared vacant; kings and princes of Christendom were invited to\r\ninvade his realm, to take his crown and sceptre, to expel him a homeless\r\nfriendless connudate outcast in a world that shunned him like a\r\npestilence, like the horrid leprous scab of creeping things which his\r\nblasted human body inevitably would become. Then, suppliant, submissive,\r\nhe crawled to his Canossa; as the late Duke of Lauenberg crawled to the\r\nLord Leo P.P. XIII the other day; as Caesar Fridericus Ahenobarbus\r\nSemper Augustus abjectly crawled to, and waited at, the gates of the\r\nhuge Englishman, Nicholas Breakespeare, the Lord Hadrian P.P. IV, who\r\nruled the world eight hundred years ago, “Not for thee, but for Peter,”\r\nthat indignant Emperor muttered, perforce doing groom’s service for\r\nPeter’s Successor, holding the stirrup of the pontifical palfrey. “For\r\nUs, _and_ for Peter,” the superb English Pope retorted, as He bent\r\nCaesar to His unconquerable will. Arrogant? Arrogant——of any miserable\r\nmortal man who did not believe himself to be, who had not been\r\nofficially crowned and saluted, and to whom every emperor and king and\r\nprince of Christendom, every Christian sovereign and subject of Europe,\r\nhad not sworn allegiance as, “Ruler of the World, Father of Princes and\r\nof Kings, Earthly Vicar of Jesus Christ our Saviour.”\r\n\r\nWhen the action of the human mind is inspired by the principle\r\nendeavoured here to be set down, the inexpugnable face of\r\nExcommunication, (magnified by the assent to its validity of the\r\nexcommunicated one,) perhaps, may be realized. Duke Alfonso d’Este could\r\nnot hope to stand where Caesar Semper Augustus fell. Naturally, he went\r\nin desperate and horrid fear. He knew that he had not deserved to be\r\ngibbeted as a Bandit before the world: but he knew also that, before the\r\nHoliness of the Pope, he, a sovereign-regnant, was crushable as a worm.\r\nHe lost no time in omitting to seek release from the hideous ban.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1513, he chose the poet Messer Ludovico Ariosto, with his\r\nbeautiful Greek profile and noble intellect, secretary and laureate of\r\nCardinal Ippolito; and named him as his Orator to open negotiations with\r\nthe Pope.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Julius P.P. II was perfectly implacable. He had not pardoned\r\nthe indiscreet criticisms of Cardinal Francisco de Borja, who had passed\r\nbeyond His power. It was the complete ruin of Borgia that alone would\r\nslake His passionate thirst for vengeance;—and a Borgia was Duchess of\r\nFerrara. He did not intend kindness to the consort of that Duchess: and\r\nHe resolved to begin, in a clerical manner, with intimidation.\r\nAccordingly, He admitted Messer Ludovico Ariosto to an audience; and\r\nimmediately ordered him to quit the Vatican by the door before he should\r\nbe thrown from the window. After this reception of a proffered\r\nolive-branch, the Pope’s Holiness coolly awaited Duke Alfonso’s next\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nDon Fabrizio Colonna flourished in the favour of the Lord Julius P.P.\r\nII; and he, also, was under many vital obligations to the Duke of\r\nFerrara. He, in his turn, tried the role of peacemaker between pontiff\r\nand sovereign; and so far succeeded, that the Holy Father farcically\r\npermitted the Duke to come to Rome, assured of a favourable reception,\r\nto plead his cause and to arrange the terms of his submission.\r\n\r\nHe came. He saw the Ruler of the World. He was conquered. The Terrible\r\nPontiff named the sole conditions on which He would consent to remit the\r\nban of excommunication. Nothing could be more enormously radical and\r\nsweeping. They were, abdication of his sovereignty over the city and\r\nwhole duchy of Ferrara, with absolute renunciation for himself and his\r\nheirs for ever of all rights therein, in favour of the Holy See; also,\r\nhis retirement to voluntary life-long exile at the little city of Asti\r\nin the province of Lombardy. Death and obliteration of the Borgia, not\r\nby vulgar assassination but by constitutional withdrawal of the means to\r\nlive, was the aim of the Terrible Pontiff; wherefore He would strip\r\nnaked Duke Alfonso, as aforetime He had stripped naked Duke Cesare.\r\n\r\nDuke Alfonso d’Este refused to purchase release from excommunication on\r\nthese disgraceful terms. The Lord Julius P.P. II let him have hints\r\nwhich gave to understand that the said terms might be mitigated. By\r\nvarious subterfuges he was detained in Rome.\r\n\r\nThe army of the Terrible Pontiff stealthily was advancing on Ferrara.\r\n\r\nThere was only a woman there.\r\n\r\nDuke Alfonso chanced to hear of the pontifical stratagem. On the\r\ninstant, he made his plans for quitting Rome. But he found that he was\r\nin a prison. The Terrible Pontiff held him; and would not let him go.\r\nThe Lord Alexander P.P. VI may not have been a Saint: but He never\r\ndirtied His honour like this.\r\n\r\nThis treachery of the Holiness of the Pope disgusted the Ghibellinism of\r\nDon Fabrizio Colonna. This was not what he had contemplated, when he\r\npersuaded Duke Alfonso to adventure his right hand in the jaws of the\r\nWolf of Rome. Considering himself to be responsible, his own honour at\r\nstake, he played a counter-stratagem upon the Lord Julius P.P. II. By\r\nhis aid, the Duke broke prison; and, under his protection, in his\r\nfortress of Marino fifteen miles from Rome, a safe asylum was provided.\r\nDuke Alfonso desired to hasten to defend his duchy now menaced by the\r\nPope: and all Colonna acclaimed his resolution. Don Prospero Colonna\r\nundertook to bring him there where he would be. Travelling by night\r\nthrough hostile territory, environed by ever-present dangers, at length,\r\ndisguised as Don Prospero’s cook, the royal and ducal Bandit reached\r\nFerrara.\r\n\r\nIn the city there was joy. In the duchy there was confidence restored.\r\nIn the heart of the Duchess Lucrezia there was gratitude for the safety\r\nof her much-loved lord. Ferrara was fresh from four years successful\r\nwar: an excessively dangerous enemy to assault, now that her leader led\r\nher. The pontifical army executed a second strategic movement at the\r\ndouble—to the rear.\r\n\r\nAnd, before the year 1513 was three months old, the Terrible Pontiff,\r\nthe Lord Julius P.P. II, (Who, according to Monsignor Paris de Grassis,\r\nsuccessor to Burchard as Papal Caerimonarius, suffered from the French\r\nDisease,) died at Rome, raving in His last delirium “Frenchmen, begone\r\nfrom Italy! Begone from Italy, Alfonso d’Este!”\r\n\r\nDreadful end of a furious revengeful disappointed plebeian who was Ruler\r\nof the World! The monstrous Moses of Michelangelo, in San Pietro _ad\r\nVincula_, marks His ambitious unfinished tomb.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Most Illustrious Lord Giovanni de’ Medici, Cardinal-Deacon of Santa\r\nMaria _in Domnica_, was the son of Lorenzo de’ Medici of Florence, born\r\nthe eleventh of December 1475. His mother was Madonna Clarice Orsini,\r\none of the sweetest and best of good mothers. Her husband said that his\r\nown mother chose her for him,\r\n\r\n                  “Tolsi donna ... ovvero mi fu data.\r\n\r\nWhen Don Giovanni was of the age of seven years (the age of reason,\r\ntechnically,) the Christian King named him Abbot of Fonte Dolce, on the\r\nnineteenth of May 1483, in which preferment the Lord Sixtus P.P IV.\r\nconfirmed him twelve days later by Brief dated the thirty-first of May\r\n1843. On the first of June he received the ecclesiastical tonsure, when\r\nepiscopal hands wielded scissors to cut the child-clerk’s hair in five\r\nplaces—on the front, the back, the right, the left, and the crown, of\r\nthe head—while bishop and boy recited the psalm verse:\r\n\r\n       “The Lord is the portion—       “_Dominus pars_—\r\n       “Of mine inheritance—           “_Haereditatis meae_—\r\n       “And of my cup—                 “_Et calicis mei_—\r\n       “Thou art He Who shall restore— “_Tu es Qui restitues_—\r\n       “Mine inheritance to me—        “_Haereditatem meam mihi_—\r\n\r\nand finally the bishop endued him with the fair white linen surplice,\r\n(super pellicem) the official vesture of his clerical estate. The\r\nsymbolism of this mystery seems to be that the clerk enlists himself in\r\nthe regular army of the Church Militant, sacrificing an actual piece of\r\nhis person as a pledge of his fidelity, and receiving as handsel, so to\r\nspeak, his uniform. From this date the child was called in his family\r\nMesser Giovanni, (Mr. John). On the first of March 1484, he was named\r\nAbbot of Passignano. He grew up a good and manly boy, fond of nice\r\nthings, grave, quietly merry, and a perfect gentleman. On the third of\r\nMarch 1489, his father’s friend the Lord Innocent P.P. VIII created him\r\nCardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria _in Domnica_; but, as he was only of the\r\nage of thirteen years, the creation was reserved _in petto_, while he\r\ncontinued his studies under Canon Angelo Ambrogini (detto Poliziano);\r\nwho, in 1492 wrote to the Pope about his pupil,\r\n\r\n  “This youth is so formed by nature and education that, being inferior\r\n  to none in genius, he yields not to his equals in industry, nor to his\r\n  teachers in learning, nor to old men in gravity of demeanour. He\r\n  naturally is honest and ingenuous, and he has been so strictly bred\r\n  that never from his mouth there comes a lewd, or even a light,\r\n  expression. Though he be so young, his judgement is so secure that\r\n  even the old respect him as a father. He sucked piety and religion\r\n  with his mother’s milk, preparing himself for his sacred office even\r\n  from his cradle. (Ep. v. Lib. VIII)”\r\n\r\nIn the Publick Consistory of the twenty-second of March 1492, he was\r\nadmitted to the Sacred College, receiving the scarlet hat and the\r\ncardinalitial sapphire ring, (whose value was six hundred zecchini\r\nd’oro—say, £1200); and he was of the age of sixteen years, three months,\r\neleven days.\r\n\r\nDuring his cardinalate his most delightful trait was the loving kindness\r\nwhich he shewed to his young cousin Giulio, (Botticelli’s most precious\r\nmodel), the bastard of Don Giuliano de’ Medici, by Madonna Antonia\r\nGorini of Florence, and who ended his life as the Lord Clement P.P. VII.\r\nCardinal Giovanni got him ennobled as a Knight of St. John of Jerusalem\r\nof Malta, and Prior of Capua; and gave him an honourable position in his\r\nhousehold as confidential counsellor: and, indeed, it was to Don Giulio,\r\nattending him as esquire in the Conclave of March 1513, that Cardinal\r\nGiovanni generously said, when the result of the squittino (scrutiny)\r\nwas made known, “Come Giulio, let us enjoy the Papacy, since God hath\r\ngiven it to Us:” and he immediately raised His cousin to the purple,\r\ngiving him His Own vacated rank of Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria _in\r\nDomnica_.[95]\r\n\r\nCardinal Giovanni, like all the Medici, was congenitally myopic. In all\r\npresentments of him, there is the slight forward bend or set of the neck\r\nwhich marks the short-sighted man. Messer Paolo Giovio says that he\r\nsurveyed the world through a concave crystal, and that this affected his\r\nskill as a sportsman. Messer Rafaele Sanzio’s portrait of him and his\r\ncousin shows him with this concave crystal spy-glass in his hand. No\r\ndoubt his physical incompleteness wonderfully aided in developing his\r\nenchanting taste and temperament; for it is well-known that the best\r\nartist is the man who does not see all.[96]\r\n\r\nThe crowd, waiting outside the Conclave of 1513 for the annunciation of\r\nthe new Pope, were confronted by a doorway builded of the fragments of\r\nother buildings. Some of the stones bore portions of mutilated\r\ninscriptions; and the crowd amused itself by piecing these together. But\r\nthere was one large stone above the lintel, whose inscription baffled\r\nexplanation. It bore the letters\r\n\r\n                          M. C. C. C. C. X. L.\r\n\r\nand presumably had come from some edifice dated 1440. Presently, the\r\ndoor was flung open; and the scarlet Cardinal-Archdeacon proclaimed, “I\r\nannounce to you great joy. We have for a Pope the Lord Giovanni de’\r\nMedici, Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria _in Domnica_, who wills to be\r\ncalled Leo the Tenth.” And in the doorway stood the white figure of the\r\nnew Successor of St. Peter, of the age of thirty eight years, His head\r\nstraining a little forward, peering through His half-closed bright eyes,\r\nlifting His hand in Apostolic Benediction. Instantly a wag in the\r\nkneeling crowd explained the cryptic inscription _Multi Caeci Cardinales\r\nCreaverunt Caecum X (decimum) Leonem_; “Many short-sighted cardinals\r\ncreated a short-sighted one Leo the Tenth.” That is a specimen of wit in\r\nthe year 1513, bright, quick, direct, pungent, and finished.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe election of the Lord Leo P.P. X was an immense relief to the Duke\r\nand Duchess of Ferrara. It meant deliverance from unscrupulous\r\npersecution for the Pope’s Holiness now was patrician, and at least a\r\ngentleman, though no enemy to the House of Borgia. So Ferrara and Borgia\r\nwent in peace. The duchy had been at war for nearly six years, almost\r\nwithout cessation; her resources were quite exhausted; her exchequer was\r\nempty. So keen was the distress, that, in order not to add to his\r\npeople’s burden by pressing for his revenues, Duke Alfonso pawned his\r\nplate, and Duchess Lucrezia her jewels which were of enormous value.\r\nThese were redeemed three years later: and it is to the inventory, made\r\nwhen they were pawned, that modern knowledge of their extraordinary\r\nrarity and worth is due.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth of September 1513 was born in Rome, of Don Tarquinio\r\nPoplicola di Santacroce and Madonna Ersilia his wife, the Noble Don\r\nProspero Poplicola di Santacroce, afterwards Cardinal-Presbyter of the\r\nTitle of San Girolamo _degli Schiavoni_ and Nuncio, who introduced\r\nTobacco into Italy and gave it the name _Erba Santacroce_, Holycross\r\nHerb.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe life of the Duchess Lucrezia, during the next few years, was a life\r\nof calm after storm, _post tot naufragias tuta_. She won fresh fame by\r\nher goodness to young girls, whom she provided with dowries, to tempt\r\nthem to keep continency by marrying well. Delightfully practical age,\r\nwhich went directly to the point attempting no maudlin half-measures,\r\n“so sweetly mawkish and so smoothly dull”! The ideal of the professional\r\nphilanthropist, then, was to make virtue easy, and vice difficult. The\r\nideal of the professional philanthropist, now, is to make virtue\r\nhorribly vulgar and vice an imperious necessity. The Duchess Lucrezia\r\nhad observed that the lack of money is the root of all evil; and, at\r\nthat root she struck.\r\n\r\nCharming descriptions are extant of the evenings which this egregious\r\nlady spent in conversation with poets and scholars, listening to music,\r\nand working on the lovely embroidery for which she was so celebrated. On\r\nthe third of July 1515, she presented her lord with a daughter. The same\r\nyear she was grieved by the death of her friend, the great printer,\r\nMesser Aldo Manuzio. That cool-headed, shrewd, and very learned\r\nVenetian, the hereditary enemy of Ferrara, has left laudations of the\r\nDuchess Lucrezia which are sincere and unsurpassable. It is not singular\r\nthat the great and good among her intimate contemporaries should be\r\nthose who praise her; and that her defamers should be professional\r\nsquibbers, notoriously base and venal. The following year, the eleventh\r\nof July, 1516, she suffered the loss of her little son who was of the\r\nage of five years. Is the touching letter, by which she conveyed the\r\nnews to her confidante and sister-in-law, the Marchioness Isabella\r\nGonzaga of Mantua, the letter of a wicked woman or of a good? She says,\r\n\r\n  “——the Most Illustrious Don Alessandro, my youngest son, after a long\r\n  and painful illness, in which remedies were of no avail, was seized by\r\n  a cruel dysentery. Yesterday, at the fourth hour of the night, (say,\r\n  midnight,) the poor little man (_poverino_) yielded his blessed soul\r\n  into the hands of our Lord God, leaving me much afflicted and full of\r\n  sorrow; as Your Excellency, being a woman and a tender mother\r\n  yourself, may easily believe.[97]”\r\n\r\nOn the Festival of All Saints, she bore another son to Duke Alfonso, who\r\nwas baptized by the name Francesco.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-sixth of November 1517, there died in Rome Madonna\r\nGiovanna de’ Catanei, the mother of the Duchess Lucrezia; and was buried\r\nin Santa Maria _del Popolo_ by the Flaminian Gate. Nine of her letters\r\nto her daughter, and rather crabbed letters too, are preserved in the\r\nArchives of Modena. They are subscribed, “_La felice ed infelice\r\nmadre_;” which seems precisely to describe her condition. She was a\r\nhappy mother; happy in the gorgeous loveliness of her children, happy in\r\ntheir good fortune, happy in being the mother of two dukes, a prince\r\nduke, and a sovereign duchess: but unhappy, in that human law made their\r\nfather not her husband. Another letter of hers, dated from Rome the\r\nfifteenth of December 1515, and signed “Perpetua Oratrice Vanozza,” has\r\nbeen the means of causing some uncertainty as to her real name. The\r\nfollowing is suggested as an explanation.\r\n\r\n“Vanozza”, of course, is a familiar abbreviation of “Giovanozza”, which\r\nis equivalent to “Big Jenny”. Italians are deliciously disrespectfully\r\ninoffensive in their use of universal and personal nicknames; which are\r\ntaken conferred without the least aggrievance. “Perpetua Oratrice[98]”\r\nis not a name at all: but a quasi-official style.\r\n\r\nIn England at the present day, one frequently is startled by the receipt\r\nof a letter, from some fervent member of that devout female sex (for\r\nwhich Holy Church, knowing needs, diurnally prays), bearing as signature\r\nthe names of the writer, with the addition “E de M”. If one has not yet\r\nseen the lions, (as the Fifteenth Century said of a novice,) one looks\r\nfor the university degree, knightly order, municipal or parochial rank,\r\nof which those letters are the sign. But, when one knows them to stand\r\nfor “Enfant de Marie,” one remembers that a pious sodality, of French\r\norigin and called “The Children of Mary,” is an excessively and\r\nuniversally fashionable one among females; and doubts are at an end.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that there was some such pious association for females of\r\nthe Borgian Era. Madonna Giovanna always was a respectable well-living\r\ncharacter: but we know that she found salvation, was converted, became\r\n_dévote_, in 1508, when she sat under Frat’ Egidio da Viterbo preaching\r\na course of Lent sermons in Rome.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested, then, that at once she began “to make her soul,” to\r\nprepare to meet her God, for she was well on in years; and that she\r\nbecame a member of some Confraternity of Perpetual Prayer, resembling\r\nthose of the present day whose members divide among themselves the duty\r\nof praying the clock round, so that an unending stream of supplication\r\nshall flow toward the Throne of Grace. It is suggested, that, being a\r\nhuman woman, cherishing no objection to a little perfectly legitimate\r\nadvertisement of virtue (like the ladies of the “E de M” description),\r\nMadonna Giovanna de’ Catanei formed the habit of signing her private\r\nletters “The Perpetual Suppliant, Big Jenny.”\r\n\r\nHer epitaph has been given on p. 261.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are two documents of this year 1517, which go to prove that, at\r\nthis time, there existed no idea of concealing the parentage of Don\r\nGiovanni Borgia the sometime Duke of Nepi and Camerino. The boy appears\r\nto have made his home with his sister, the Duchess Lucrezia; for both\r\ndocuments are issued under her protection and authority. She was\r\nnineteen years older than her brother, who now was of the age of\r\ntwenty-one years; and her notable good nature, as well as her royal\r\nestate, make it natural enough that she should be more mother than\r\nsister to her august Father’s youngest son.\r\n\r\nThe first brief (they both are quoted in Cittadella,) is dated “sub die\r\nIº Nov. 1517”; and names the Bishop of Adria as Don Giovanni’s agent in\r\nsome pecuniary transaction, he being less than twenty-five, and more\r\nthan eighteen, years old. It begins, “Ferrariae in palatio habitationis\r\nIll^{mi} ... Ill^{mus} Dominus Joannes Borgia, _frater_ Ill^{mae}\r\nDominae Lucretiae Borgiae Ducissae Ferrariae, minor annis\r\nvigintiquinque, maior tamen decem octo,——.”\r\n\r\nThe second brief is addressed to Messer Filippo Strozzi; and claims,\r\nfrom the consuls of Pesaro, the baggage which the young noble had lost\r\nafter his shipwreck in sight of that city! It is dated the second of\r\nDecember 1517; and begins, “Mandatum Ill^{mae} Dominae Ducissae\r\nFerrariae in palatio Ducali ... Ill^{ma} Domina Lucretia Borgia\r\nEstensis ... suo nomine, et nomine ac Tanquam coniuncta persona Ill^{mi}\r\nDomini Joannis Borgiae _eius frater_——.”\r\n\r\nLittle or nothing further has been discovered regarding the life of this\r\nyouth. His history, with that of his brother Prince Gioffredo Borgia of\r\nSquillace, waits to reward research in the archives of Naples, Nepi,\r\nCamerino and Ferrara. Reluctantly, they must be left here among the\r\n_Sparks That Die_.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following announcement closes the second epoch of the House of\r\nBorgia. It is dated the twenty-first day of June 1519; and was sent by\r\nflying posts to his nephew, the Marquess Federigo Gonzaga of Mantua: “It\r\nhath pleased the Lord God to take unto Himself the soul of the\r\nIllustrious Duchess, my much-beloved Consort. (Signed) Alfonsus Dux\r\nFeraria.”\r\n\r\nThe “Illustrious Duchess” Lucrezia Borgia was buried in her favourite\r\nchurch at the monastery of Corpus Domini, by side of her husband’s\r\nmother the Duchess Leonor de Aragona, deeply and sincerely mourned by\r\nher children, and her husband Duke Alfonso d’Este, and, indeed, by all\r\nFerrara duchy crowding round her bier. She was only in the forty-second\r\nyear of her age.\r\n\r\nMay she rest in the fragrant peace of her good deeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Book the Third=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        The Brilliant Light[99]\r\n\r\n  “_A fire that is kindled, begins with smoke and hissing, while it lays\r\n      hold on the faggots; bursts into a roaring blaze, with raging\r\n      tongues of flame, devouring all in reach, spangled with sparks\r\n      that die; settles into the steady genial glare, the brilliant\r\n      light, that men call fire_;”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Borgia, who have gone before, present no difficulty to the Twentieth\r\nCentury. When once their formula has been learned, they are found to be\r\nmen of like passions with ourselves. They were born—they struggled\r\nthrough life with an amazing amount of dignity and success—they died.\r\nFor a reason which has yet to be explained, the human race has made them\r\nserve for hell-myths, for prodigies of turpitude, for symbols wherewith\r\nto express ultimate and abysmal crime.\r\n\r\n  “The slave of his own appetites, in bondage to conventional laws, his\r\n  spirit emasculated by the indulgences, or corroded by the cares of\r\n  life, hardly daring to act, to think, or to speak, for himself;\r\n  man,—gregarious man,—worships the world in which he lives, adopts its\r\n  maxims, and treads its beaten paths. To rouse him from his lethargy,\r\n  and to give a new current to his thoughts, heroes appear from time to\r\n  time on the verge of his horizon; and hero-worship, Pagan or\r\n  Christian, withdraws him for a while from still baser idolatry. To\r\n  contemplate the motives and the career of such men may teach much that\r\n  well deserves the knowing: but nothing more clearly than this—that no\r\n  one can have shrines erected to his memory in the hearts of men of\r\n  different generations, unless his own heart was an altar, on which the\r\n  daily sacrifices, of fervent devotion and magnanimous self denial,\r\n  were offered to the only true Object of human worship.”[100]\r\n\r\nThe wheel of time makes one unerring revolution; and lo, a saint,—a\r\nBorgia Saint.\r\n\r\nTo write of Saint Francisco de Borja, so that he may be known of men, is\r\nmore than difficult. Each man knows another, not by his strength but by\r\nhis weaknesses, not as surpassing but as lacking such and such of the\r\nIdeal; for weakness makes men kin. And Saint Francisco de Borja gave no\r\nsign of human weakness, little or no sign of human nature, after he had\r\nreached his manhood. He has been called “a magnified non-natural man”;\r\nand that is the only point of view from which he can be observed. He\r\nlived entirely on the supernatural plane: the world, to him, was nothing\r\nbut an enemy with whom he would have neither art nor part: he was in it,\r\nbut not of it: his ways were not men’s ways, nor his thoughts men’s\r\nthoughts: he rightly cannot be liked, or disliked, hated, or loved,\r\nadmired, or even judged. He must be taken as he was, comparable to none,\r\nthe exact antipodes of his strenuous august invincible magnificent\r\nancestors for there are “diversities of gifts,” in opposition to all\r\nhuman ideals, a “magnified non-natural man.” His note is brilliantly\r\npersonal. He was utterly and absolutely selfishly solicitous about his\r\nown salvation. He made that the unique object of his life; and, to that\r\nend, he deliberately chose renunciation, hardship, ignominy, utter and\r\nextreme. His singular devotion, to the task of living according to his\r\nlight, is a phenomenon of an intensity beyond the natural, environing\r\nhim with an aura as of one aloof, as of one alien among men, and,\r\ntherefore, altogether antipathetic to men.\r\n\r\nHe was the great-grandson of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, Whose bastard\r\nDon Juan Francisco de Borja, Duke of Gandia in Spain, Prince of Teano\r\nand Tricarico, Count of Chiaramonte, Lauria, and Cerignola, Constable of\r\nNaples, and General of the Pontifical Army, had married Doña Maria de\r\nAragona, a princess of the royal House of Aragon. After the mysterious\r\nmurder of her husband at Rome in 1497, the Duchess Doña Maria married\r\nDon Enriquez de Luna, uncle and Master of the Household to the Viceroy\r\nDon Hernando of Castile, and Grand Commander of Leon, who soon left her\r\nwidowed the second time. She lived at Baeza in Granada, and devoted\r\nherself to her two children, Doña Isabella, and Don Juan II de Borja,\r\nwho succeeded his murdered father as Duke of Gandia and the rest. When\r\nher son married, she retired to the monastery of Poor Clares (the Second\r\nOrder of the Religion of San Francesco d’Assisi) at Gandia, where she\r\ntook the vows of a nun, and became Suor Maria Gabriella till her death\r\nin 1537. Her daughter, Doña Isabella, who was betrothed to the Duke of\r\nSegorbe, obtained the necessary dispensations, broke before marriage\r\nfrom her affianced husband; and followed the Duchess of Gandia her\r\nbeloved mother to the Poor Clares, where she also took the vows as Suor\r\nFrancisca de Jesus.\r\n\r\nDon Juan II married, first, Dona Francisca de Castro y Pinos; secondly,\r\nDoña Juana de Aragona, bastard of Archbishop Don Alonso de Aragona of\r\nSaragossa nephew of the Catholic King Don Hernando of Spain.[101]\r\nFourteen children were the offspring of these marriages;\r\n\r\n  DON FRANCISCO, THE SAINT:\r\n\r\n  Don Alonso, Abbot of Valdigna:\r\n\r\n  Don Enrico, Cardinal-Deacon of San Nereo e Sant’ Achilleo:\r\n\r\n  Doña Luisa, married Don Martino de Aragona y Gurrea, Duke of\r\n      Villahermosa:\r\n\r\n  Don Rodrigo, Cardinal-Deacon of San Niccolo _in Carcere Tulliano_:\r\n      “while still a youth” (Ciacconi)\r\n\r\n  Don Pedro Luis, Viceroy of Cataluna:\r\n\r\n  Don Tommaso, Archbishop of Saragossa, (in succession to Archbishop Don\r\n      Juan de Aragona bastard of Archbishop Don Alonso,) and Viceroy of\r\n      Aragon:\r\n\r\n  Don Felipe, Knight of Montesa and Governor of Oran:\r\n\r\n  Don Diego, died young:\r\n\r\n  _Doña Juana, First Abbess of the Royal Monastery of Discalced\r\n      Carmelites at Madrid. She died in the Odour of Sanctity_:\r\n\r\n  Doña Leonor, married Don Juan de Gurrea:\r\n\r\n  Doña Magdalena, married Don Hernando de Proxita, Count of Almenara:\r\n\r\n  Doña Margarita, married Don Fadrique de Portugal y Cordo:\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Doña Isabella, followed her grandmother Doña Maria (Suor Maria\r\n      Gabriella), and her aunt Doña Isabella (Suor Francisca de Jesus)\r\n      to the Poor Clares of Gandia, of which monastery she became\r\n      Abbess.\r\n\r\nThat is a very characteristic family of a Grandee and Hijo de algo (son\r\nof something) of Spain. Leaving the heir out of the question, the eight\r\nsons divide between them two cardinalates, an archbishopric, an abbacy,\r\ntwo viceroyalties, and a governorship: while, of the six daughters, two\r\nenter religion and become abbesses, and four marry grandees and\r\nsemi-royalty of Spain. It is worth noting too, that shame on account of\r\ntheir origin, or their ancestors’ supposed misbehaviour, has not yet\r\nmade its appearance. Alonso was the name of many royal bastards of the\r\nHouse of Aragon, as well as of the Lord Calixtus P.P. III. Rodrigo was\r\nthe name of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, who also began his public career\r\nin the Cardinal-Diaconate of San Niccolo _in Carcere Tulliano_, and\r\nWhose eldest bastard (ob. 1481) was called Pedro Luis. All these names\r\nwere repeated here in the third and fourth generation; and the eldest\r\nson of Don Juan II, bore the second name of his murdered grandfather,\r\nFrancisco.\r\n\r\nThe Terrible Pontiff, the Lord Julius P.P. II was reigning in Rome, when\r\nDon Francisco de Borja was born in 1510 at the ducal palace of Gandia in\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nThe Terrible Pontiff was only a terrible memory ten years later, and the\r\nLord Leo P.P. X. was trying hard to “enjoy the Papacy,” in Rome when\r\nriots arose in Gandia, the ducal palace was sacked, and Don Juan II,\r\nwith his family, was forced to flee for life. Don Francisco, then a\r\ngracious boy of ten, was sent to his uncle Archbishop Don Juan de\r\nAragona at Saragossa,[102] who supplied him with a house and retinue\r\nsuited to his condition, and masters who taught him music, fencing, and\r\nLatin grammar; for he was to be bred as became the heir to the duchy of\r\nGandia, and the future head of the Spanish Branch of the House of Borja.\r\n\r\nIn January 1522 died the Lord Leo P.P. X; and the Lord Hadrian P.P. VI,\r\na ship-carpenter’s son out of Utrecht in Flanders, was elected Pope,\r\ncalled the Laocoon a pagan idol, walled-up the Belvedere statue-gallery\r\nof the Vatican; and died. To Him, in 1523, succeeded Cardinal Giulio de’\r\nMedici, cousin and life-friend of the Lord Leo P.P. X, who ascended\r\nPeter’s Throne under the title of the Lord Clement P.P. VII. Great\r\nchanges were taking place in Europe. By marriage, conquest, inheritance,\r\nor lapse, the Holy Roman Empire had passed into the hands of Spain. The\r\nElect-Emperor Carlos V, though he ceremonially had not been crowned with\r\nthe Iron Crown or the Double Golden Diadem, ruled in Spain, Naples and\r\nSouthern Italy, Germany, Austria, and part of France. King Henry VIII\r\nTudor, the Defender of the Faith, was becoming a power in England. The\r\nChristian King of France was his rival: but the Continent of Europe\r\nmainly was the Elect-Emperor’s, and wholly, perhaps, the Roman Pontiffs.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fourteen years, Don Francisco de Borja went to Tor de\r\nSillas as page of honour to the Infanta Doña Catalina, the\r\nElect-Emperor’s sister, who was about to be married to King Don Juan III\r\nof Portugal.\r\n\r\nWhen the marriage took place in 1525, Don Francisco did not accompany\r\nhis royal mistress to her new kingdom; because his father, who had for\r\nhim a higher ambition, had commanded his return to Saragossa to study\r\nrhetoric and philosophy under his uncle, the Archbishop Don Juan. Here\r\nhe remained until he passed his seventeenth year; and in 1528 he entered\r\nthe Court of the Elect-Emperor Carlos V, where his robust physical\r\nbeauty, his courteous manner, and his brilliant ability, gained for him\r\na notable reception.\r\n\r\nHumanly speaking, this acceptance of service under such a potentate is\r\nmost astonishing in a youth of the gracious piety of Don Francisco. The\r\nElect-Emperor was hot and reeking from the commission of what must have\r\nseemed to be a perfectly appalling crime—the ghastly Sack of Rome of\r\n1527, the fierce beleaguerment of God’s Vicegerent the Lord Clement P.P.\r\nVII in the Mola of Hadrian, carnage, pillage, rape, rapine, sacred\r\nmonastic enclosures violated, virginity deflowered, nuns and the wives\r\nand daughters of Roman citizens gambled for and ravished in the public\r\nstreets by the Elect-Emperor’s unpaid army of drunken Lutheran Goths and\r\nCatholic Catalans. It was to the Court of this monarch that Don\r\nFrancisco de Borja brought the Gracious flower of his maiden manlihood.\r\n\r\nAmid voluptuous surroundings, he found that it was better to marry than\r\nto burn; and, in 1529, being then of the age of nineteen years, he led\r\nin marriage the Noble Doña Leonor of Portugal. The Elect-Emperor, to\r\nmark imperial approval, perhaps, also, from the generous benevolence of\r\na man who himself is about to receive—(he had come to terms with the\r\nLord Clement P.P. VII, and was hoping for the Dual Coronation,)—created\r\nDon Francisco Marquess of Lombay.\r\n\r\nThe relations between Pope and Elect-Emperor were after this fashion.\r\nBoth were exhausted: both were desirous of peace. Peace, then, was\r\nsigned, and a perpetual alliance, on the twentieth of June 1527. The\r\nElect-Emperor had gained territory from Venice, and detached Genoa from\r\nFrance; the Pope’s Holiness had promised to invest him with crown of\r\nNaples, (which his predecessor the Catholic King Don Hernando of Spain\r\nhad stolen from the bastard Aragon dynasty in 1501); and formally to\r\ncrown him as Holy Roman Emperor. The Lord Clement P.P. VII had gained a\r\nstrong ally, who guaranteed to subdue rebellious Florence for the\r\npontifical nephew Duke Alessandro de’ Medici, to consolidate the\r\nalliance by marrying the Bastard Doña Margarita of Austria to the said\r\npontifical nephew; and to procure the restoration of pontifical\r\nauthority in Emilia, Ravenna, and Cervia. They had been hideous enemies,\r\nthese two; and the Elect-Emperor had behaved abominably. Even now, he\r\nrefused to go to Monza or to Sant’ Ambrogio at Milan for the Iron Crown,\r\nor to the Lateran Basilica of Rome for the Golden Imperial Diadem, as by\r\nprecedent he would have been compelled to do, had he belonged to the\r\nHouse of Swabia. But he was a Spaniard, arrogant, cruel, unscrupulous,\r\nand infamously powerful; and he insolently told the Pope’s Holiness that\r\nhe had not the habit of running after crowns, for, instead, they came to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIf the coronation of the Successor of St. Peter be a remarkable\r\nfunction, the coronation according to the Roman Rite of the Successor of\r\nCaius Julius Caesar Octavianus Augustus is but one degree less\r\nsumptuous. It would be worth the while of any man of the Twentieth\r\nCentury to exchange lives with William of Hohenzollern, for the sake of\r\nthe opening which lies before him. In the case of Carlos V, all\r\nceremonies duly were observed. The Lord Clement P.P. VII came to\r\nBologna, a neutral city, for the coronation, and the Elect-Emperor met\r\nHim there. On the twenty-second of February 1530, in the Chapel of the\r\nApostolic Palace, the Iron Crown[103] was set upon the imperial head.\r\nTwo days later, in the Cathedral of San Petronio, curtains were drawn\r\naround the imperial canopy forming a pavilion wherein the Elect-Emperor\r\nstripped naked for the anointing with holy oil and chrism. He was\r\nordained deacon, vested in the sacred imperial dalmatica, endued with\r\norb and sword and sceptre offered by reigning sovereigns, God’s\r\nVicegerent crowned him with the high closed Double Crown of Empire and\r\nheralds proclaimed him\r\n\r\n                     CAESAR\r\n\r\n ROMANORUM IMPERATOR SEMPER AUGUSTUS MUNDI TOTIUS DOMINUS UNIVERSIS\r\n    DOMINIS UNIVERSIS PRINCIPIBUS ET POPULIS SEMPER VENERANDUS.\r\n\r\nThese things having been done, Pope and Emperor appeared in the\r\ncathedral porch. There, Caesar Carlos V vested in full imperial\r\ninsignia, held the Pontiffs stirrup as He mounted, and led His palfrey\r\nseveral paces, as a public act of homage and allegiance to Him By Whose\r\nSanction Kings Do Reign. Then, he mounted his own charger, and rode by\r\nthe Lord Clement P.P. VII’s side through the city of Bologna making\r\nknights, as the way is, when the Pontiff left him.\r\n\r\nIt is probable enough that the Marquess Don Francisco de Borja\r\nwitnessed, and assisted at, this superb ceremony. He was attached to the\r\npersonal suite of Caesar Carlos V: but there is another circumstance\r\nthat implies that, in some way or another, most presumably in the flesh,\r\nhe was brought into contact with the Pope’s Holiness about this time. It\r\nis that a little later, the Supreme Pontiff conferred an extraordinary\r\nfavour on his illustrious House, consisting of Five Privileges granted\r\nto Duke Juan II of Gandia, his heirs and descendants of both sexes, and\r\nwhomsoever they might marry, IN CONSIDERATION OF THE SIGNAL SERVICES\r\nRENDERED TO THE HOLY SEE BY THE HOUSE OF BORGIA. This unmistakeably\r\ndistinct statement shews that calumnies and lampoons of Messer Francesco\r\nGuicciardini had made no ill impression on the Lord Clement P.P. VII,\r\nwho actually had met that writer when he was the guest of the _bas bleu_\r\nMadonna Veronica Gambara during the coronation festivities at Bologna.\r\nThe fable of Borgia iniquity is a plant of later growth. In 1531 the\r\nHouse was considered to have rendered signal services, deserving\r\nrecognition, _for a perpetual memorial_. Hence the granting of the Five\r\nPrivileges which follow here.\r\n\r\n  I\r\n\r\n  “To any confessor whom they may select,[104] powers to absolve them\r\n  from the gravest ecclesiastical censures and penalties: to commute the\r\n  obligation of fasting to almsgiving: once a year to absolve them in\r\n  cases usually reserved to the Holy See; or from any oath or vow but\r\n  those generally excepted.\r\n\r\n  II\r\n\r\n  “Special indulgences for the hour of Death, and for visits to a\r\n  church, or an altar: also, for every mass offered _by_ a scion of the\r\n  House (he being in priest’s orders), or _for_ any scion of the House,\r\n  indulgences equal to those which might be gained at the altars of San\r\n  Sebastiano, San Lorenzo, Santa Pudentiana, and Santa Maria _de Panis_\r\n  in Rome.\r\n\r\n  III\r\n\r\n  “Permission to use _Lacticinia_ (all food made of milk and eggs) and\r\n  meat,[105] on fast days throughout the year: this permission to extend\r\n  to guests and servants of the family. Permission to take luncheon at\r\n  mid-day, and dinner at night. Permission to receive the sacraments\r\n  within prohibited times.[106] Permission to be buried on any day in\r\n  the year, Easter alone excepted.\r\n\r\n  IV\r\n\r\n  “Priests who are scions of the House of Borgia may anticipate or\r\n  postpone their recitation of the Breviary Offices without observing\r\n  the fixed hours, reciting the whole office at once, or dividing it at\r\n  their pleasure.\r\n\r\n  V\r\n\r\n  “To female scions of the House of Borgia, or connections by marriage,\r\n  liberty once a month to enter the enclosure of nuns,[107] taking with\r\n  them four others to converse with the nuns, and to eat with them,\r\n  provided only that they do not remain for the night.” (_La heroica\r\n  vida, etc., del grande San Francisco de Borja, by Cardinal Alvaro\r\n  Cienfuegos. Madrid, 1717._ I. iii. 3, 4.)\r\n\r\nThe marriage of the Marquess Don Francisco, and the Marchioness Doña\r\nLeonor, of Lombay, resulted in the birth of eight children, who were,\r\n\r\n  Don Carlos, the heir:\r\n\r\n  Don Juan, Count of Ficalho; Viceroy of Portugal; Ambassador of King\r\n      Don Felipe III.; Author of _Empresas Morales_ (1581); Married to\r\n      Doña Lorenza Oñaz de Loyola, heiress of Don Beltrano, Señor de\r\n      Loyola:\r\n\r\n  Don Alvaro, Marquess of Alcaguizes; Ambassador of King Don Felipe III\r\n      to the Holy See:\r\n\r\n  Don Hernando, Knight of the Order of Calatrava:\r\n\r\n  Don Alonso, Chamberlain to the Empress Maria:\r\n\r\n  Doña Isabella, married Don Francisco de Sandoval y Rojas, Marquess of\r\n      Denia, Count of Lerina: (from this marriage descends the ducal\r\n      house of Lerina:)\r\n\r\n  Doña Juana, married Don Juan Enriquez de Almanas, Marquess of\r\n      Alcanices:\r\n\r\n  Doña Dorotea, nun at the monastery of Poor Clares in Gandia.\r\n\r\nSix years the Marquess Don Francisco spent in the duties of a husband,\r\nfather, and courtier. In 1536, he accompanied Caesar Carlos V on a\r\nfutile vainglorious expedition into Provence. Harassed by the French\r\ncommander Montmorency, his vast preparations all nullified, his troops\r\nwasted by disease and discredited by disaster, half his army _hors de\r\ncombat_ by reason of famine and plague, two months of inglorious\r\ncampaigning sufficed for Caesar Carlos V. The French raised the\r\npeasantry against him; his retreat became a rout; and only a shattered\r\nfragment of his once-magnificent army reached the gates of Milan.\r\nBurning to retrieve his shame in the eyes of Europe, he launched a\r\nsecond vast expedition against Algiers; only to encounter a second\r\nignominious disaster. Such were the Marquess Don Francisco de Borja’s\r\nexperiences of war.\r\n\r\nIn 1537, died in the monastery of Poor Clares at Gandia, the Suor Maria\r\nGabriella (Doña Maria de Aragona y Luna) widow of the murdered Duke of\r\nGandia (bastard of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI), and grandmother of the\r\nMarquess Don Francisco. The same year, also, death claimed his brother\r\nDon Rodrigo, who had enjoyed the Cardinal-Diaconate of San Niccolo _in\r\nCarcere Tulliano_ only one year.\r\n\r\nIn 1539, an event occurred which fundamentally affected the Marquess Don\r\nFrancisco. He and his wife the Marchioness Doña Leonor, were lord- and\r\nlady-in-waiting to Caesar’s wife, the Empress Doña Isabella. While\r\nCaesar was at Toledo trying to wring a grant of money from the Cortes of\r\nCastile, a sudden illness took the Empress, and she died. The Marquess\r\nand Marchioness of Lombay were entrusted with the duty of bringing the\r\nimperial corpse for burial to Elvira. There, was performed the ceremony\r\nof verification. Before the opened coffin, the Marquess Don Francisco\r\nwas required to swear before the magistracy, that its contents were the\r\nmortal relics of the Empress Isabella. Corruption had set in, completely\r\nravaging the dead: the face was like no human face and totally\r\nunrecognizable. The Marquess Don Francisco swore, not from recognition,\r\nbut from knowledge that the coffin had never left his care. But a\r\npermanent impression scathed and branded him. He saw Death the\r\nInevitable, the Horrible. Life at its highest and best, such as he\r\nhimself enjoyed, offered no equivalent to, no consolation for, the end\r\nwhich none escape. He resolved to qualify for life eternal.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most prominent note in the Spanish character is\r\nsinglemindedness. It can pursue a single aim with a concentration of\r\nenergy, with a fulness and pertinacity of unwavering will which is\r\nsimply astounding. Is it kind and noble: the kind nobility of Don\r\nQuixote de la Mancha exemplifies Spanish ideal. Is it cruel: the\r\nruthless remorseless impersonal cruelty of Torquemada makes worlds to\r\nwince. Is it pious: it achieves complete disagreeable detachment of soul\r\nfrom every earthly sentiment, possession, hope, desire. Is it impious: a\r\nSpaniard will ravish an abbess of eighty, the corpse of a virginal\r\nnovice, the statue of Truth. Is it gay: no lark in the sun on the\r\nmorning of Easter is gayer. Is it gloomy: black moonless night,\r\nunstarred, brooding on pools obscure, shadowed by funeral pines, is not\r\nmore fathomless than the deep depth of gloom veiling sad Spanish eyes.\r\nThe sight of the dead Empress Isabella drew that veil across the joy of\r\nliving, for the Marquess Don Francisco. He resolved to abjure the world:\r\nhe prayed that God would shew the way, and break the bonds that bound\r\nhim there. He was of the age of nine and twenty years.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Toledo, Caesar named him Viceroy of Cataluna and\r\nKnight of the Order of Sant’ Jago. Entering with zeal on his new duties,\r\nhe swept away the brigands who made travelling dangerous and obstructed\r\ncommerce in his province. He found justice hard to come by; and the\r\njudges corrupt and venal. He reformed them all. Hospitals for sick and\r\nneedy, schools and colleges for the education of the young, sprang up\r\nunder his viceregal rule. A Sixteenth Century Viceroy was responsible,\r\nnot to press or parliament or self-styled philanthropists; but to one\r\nearthly power alone—the Caesar. So long as his province regularly paid\r\nits tribute, and gave no trouble to the imperial exchequer, the Viceroy\r\nhad absolute freedom. He was a despot in all but name. On this account,\r\na Viceroy who laboured for his people’s welfare was something of a\r\nnovelty. The piety of the Marquess Don Francisco grew intenser; he\r\nchanged his habit; going to Holy Communion once a week instead of once a\r\nmonth. He was trying to detach himself from the world—that despotic\r\nViceroy.\r\n\r\nPresently, there came a new kind of religious man, neither monk, nor\r\nfriar, nor secular priest (to speak strictly), but a priest, one Padre\r\nAretino Aroaz, “of the company of Jesus,” he said; and he preached\r\nbefore the Viceroy at Barcelona. From him, the Marquess Don Francisco\r\nheard the marvellous history of the marvellous man, the Señor Don Iñigo\r\nLopez de Recalde, of the House of Loyola; who, born in 1491, the year\r\nbefore the Borgia Lord Alexander P.P. VI began to rule Christendom from\r\nRome, had followed a career of arms; taken a serious incapacitating\r\nwound in 1521; become converted; gone on a pilgrimage to Nuestra Señora,\r\nthe Μητροπάρθενος, of Montserrat, in 1522; lived ten months in an\r\nhermitage at Manresa; studied theology in that same city of Barcelona;\r\ntestified everywhere to his faith in Christ; been imprisoned by the\r\nSpanish Inquisition for heresy—six weeks at Alcala, three weeks at\r\nSalamanca; studied theology again in Paris from 1528 to 1532; received\r\nHoly Order as a priest; founded a Religion of military priest-knights of\r\nChrist; gained the sanction and benison of Christ’s Vicar, the Lord Paul\r\nP.P. III, for his “Company of Jesus”;[108] and given to the world a book\r\nof Spiritual Exercises for the training of the soul in counsels of\r\nperfection. All this was of extreme interest and significance to the\r\nMarquess Don Francisco. To know more, he entertained a correspondence\r\nwith this Padre Iñigo de Loyola in Rome.\r\n\r\nThis same year 1539, the Viceroy’s brother Don Enrico had news that the\r\nLord Paul P.P. III deigned to raise him to the Sacred College, as\r\nCardinal-Deacon of San Nereo e Sant’ Achilleo, the Title of which\r\npreviously had been held by Cardinal Francisco de Borja, bastard of the\r\nLord Calixtus P.P. III who died excommunicate in 1511. Setting out for\r\nRome to receive the cardinalitial insignia, Don Enrico reached Viterbo,\r\nwhere he suddenly died in September 1540. His epitaph in the Vatican\r\nBasilica shews that no shame was known at this date on account of\r\ndescent from the invincible Lord Alexander P.P. VI.\r\n\r\n      “HENRICUS . GENTE . BORGIA . NATIONE . HISPANUS .\r\n      PATRIA . VALENTINUS . ALEXANDER . VI. . PRONEPOS .\r\n      DUCIS . GANDIAE . F . DUM . IN . MAXIMA . SPE . ASSURGERET .\r\n      IMMATURA . MORTE . HEU . NIMIUM . RAPTUS . EST .\r\n      SPIRITUS . IN . CAELO . CORPUS . HIC . QUIESCIT.”\r\n\r\nThere were now no cardinals of the House of Borgia.\r\n\r\nIn 1543, died the Duke Don Juan II. de Borja, father of the Viceroy\r\nMarquess of Lombay, who now succeeded to the Duchy of Gandia, the\r\nprincipalities of Teano and Tricarico, the counties of Chiaramonte,\r\nLauria, and Cerignola. Having obtained Caesar’s leave to resign the\r\nViceroyalty of Cataluna, Duke Don Francisco de Borja returned to court,\r\nwhere he was appointed Master of the Household of the Infanta Doña Maria\r\nde Portugal. This princess was betrothed to the Infante Don Felipe, son\r\nof Caesar Carlos V; and it appeared that worldly ties were not to be\r\nuntied, but tightened for the Duke of Gandia. But the Portuguese Infanta\r\ndied before marriage, her household was dispersed; and Duke Don\r\nFrancisco retired to his duchy, where he began to make plans for a new\r\ncollege for the Company of Jesus (which perfectly had charmed him), and\r\nfor a new monastery of Dominican nuns in whom his Duchess Doña Leonor\r\nwas interested.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe year 1546, in a most signal manner marked the Duke of Gandia’s\r\nprogress along the road of detachment from the world.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess was sick. The Duke was praying for her recovery. The FIGURE\r\non the Crucifix spoke to him.\r\n\r\nWhat follows here rests on sworn testimony at the subsequent process of\r\ncanonization, later to be described; a formal legal process that, from\r\nits scope and stringency, demands as much consideration as the Report of\r\na Royal Commission, or, better still, a Decision of the Judicial\r\nCommittee of the Privy Council, in modern England.\r\n\r\nThe FIGURE on the Crucifix spoke: “—oyo una voz sensible, carinosa e\r\ndistinta, que Christo articulaba desde aquella estatua muerta.”[109]\r\n\r\nIT said: “Si tu quieres que te dexe à la Duquesa mas tempo in esta vida,\r\nyo lo dexo en tu mano; pero te aviso que à ti no te conviene esto.” _If\r\nthou askest Me to leave the Duchess longer in this life, I will do so;\r\nbut I warn thee that this will not be profitable to thee._[110]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Gandia repeated this to his confessor. He also told him his\r\nreply, which was as follows:\r\n\r\n  “What is this, O my God? Dost Thou indeed commit to a weak and\r\n  trembling hand like mine, a Power which belongs to Thy Divine\r\n  Omnipotence? What art Thou, O my Only Good? And what am I, that Thou\r\n  should’st desire to do my will; when I was sent into the world for the\r\n  purpose of doing Thine Alone, and of obeying, not only Every Command,\r\n  but Every Inspiration of my Rightful Master? What Immeasurable\r\n  Goodness is This, that, in order to shew favour to a creature, Thou\r\n  should’st be willing to abrogate Thy Supreme Prerogative as his\r\n  Creator! Since it is my wish to belong, not to myself, but altogether\r\n  to Thee, I desire that, not my will, but Thine, should be done. Leave\r\n  nothing O Lord to the decision of Francisco de Borja. Remember how\r\n  often his feelings have blinded him and led him astray. Surely I\r\n  cannot do less in return for Thine Infinite Condescension and Gracious\r\n  Generosity, than to offer to Thee the lives of my wife and children as\r\n  well as mine own, and everything, in fact, that I possess in the\r\n  world. From Thine Hand I have received all: to Thee do I return all:\r\n  earnestly entreating Thee to dispose of all according to Thy Good\r\n  Pleasure.”\r\n\r\nThe Duchess died.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to engage in a disquisition anent the Speaking\r\nCrucifix. It is conceivable that He, Who made the ass of Balaam speak,\r\ncould also make a statue speak. It already has been said that this\r\nhistory deals with matters which, as far as little human knowledge\r\ngoes—and that is not far—, are out of the course of nature. The affair\r\nmost rigorously has been investigated, and admitted, by a competent\r\ntribunal, whose verdict must be taken as going as near the path of truth\r\nas it is possible for a human tribunal to go. Therefore, the item of the\r\nSpeaking Crucifix, with other items of supernatural manifestation, will\r\nbe related as they occur, without attempts to explain them away, or to\r\nfit them with an adequate apology. If it be granted that they be\r\npossible, they at once become extremely probable. The length and\r\nelaboration of the Duke of Gandia’s reply are considered, by some, as\r\nproving it to have been composed after the event, and with due\r\nconsideration. This conclusion is quite worthy of notice, because it is\r\nopen to serious and practical objection. The few men, and the many\r\nwomen, who habitually pray to God and to His saints, who are in direct\r\nfrank frequent and habitual communication with the other world, will be\r\nperfectly well aware of the spontaneous ease with which ideas\r\nautomatically sort themselves, the formal phrases of the special\r\nlanguage automatically flow, from the lips of those whose life is one\r\ncontinual prayer. To these the Duke of Gandia’s utterance presents no\r\ndifficulty: they recognize a foreign tongue with which they chance to be\r\nacquainted. Also, it is quite permissible to understand those words as\r\nnot having been uttered actually, but as clothing the sentiments of the\r\nmind of the Duke of Gandia.\r\n\r\nViewing the affair from a human stand-point, ordinary men will regard\r\nDuke Don Francisco’s conduct as abhorrent, as heartless, as utterly\r\nbrutal. It was. Granting the circumstances, he deliberately sacrificed\r\nthe life of his wife. But his conduct was purely superhuman, purely\r\nsupernatural. He was one of the many Roman Catholics of the Sixteenth\r\nCentury—the Twentieth is less prolific—who really and truly believed _In\r\nThe Life Of The World To Come_. His actions prove it. He knew that every\r\nman inevitably must submit to the hideous ordeal of surrendering to\r\nGod’s enemy, Death, as the price of entrance to eternity. He judged\r\nthat, the sooner this ordeal was over, the better it would be.\r\nTherefore, confident in the merits of his Saviour and his wife’s, the\r\nchance of translation being offered, he incontinently accepted on her\r\nbehalf. It was the act of a truly Christian, of a cruelly unworldly man.\r\n“He wished to be rid of his wife!”\r\n\r\nHe did wish. Is it wrong to accept the joy of heaven for one loved,\r\nsuffering here on earth? “But his wish was selfish!”\r\n\r\nHis wish was selfish. The Duke of Gandia gained by the death of his\r\nwife. He gained liberty to tear the flesh of his gracious body with\r\nthongs and scourges. He gained liberty to abdicate his duchy, his\r\nmarquessate, his two principalities, his three counties; to strip\r\nhimself of every farthing of his enormous wealth; to forsake his home,\r\nhis children, his palaces, and his power; to starve on foul bread and\r\nfouler water; to wear odiously ugly clothes; to do menial service for\r\nhis natural inferiors; to wheel manure in barrows; worst of all, to herd\r\nwith vulgar men; to make himself disliked and scorned and hated,\r\nliterally——: if it be selfish to desire these things, then the Duke of\r\nGandia was a selfish man. “It is impossible to admire him!”\r\n\r\nPeople who say these silly things make the mistake, commit the\r\ninjustice, are guilty of the absurd inconsistency, of judging the Duke\r\nof Gandia by comparing him to their own ideal. He must be regarded as he\r\nwas; not as he might have been if he had imitated the ideal of some\r\nTwentieth Century plumber, haberdasher, or journalist. It is not\r\nnecessary to admire him. He never courted admiration; nor imitation\r\neither. What he did was personal between himself and his God. He acted\r\nup to his lights. He obeyed the voice of his conscience. He took for his\r\nideal, that of San Francesco d’Assisi,\r\n\r\n                     NUDUS NUDUM CHRISTUM SEQUENS,\r\n\r\nHe had the right. The affair was his. And his deeds can be related only:\r\nfor, to use them to teach a lesson or to point a moral would be like a\r\nvain beating of the air. Lessons in this department of knowledge are\r\ngiven by no human instructor; and they are given solely to the hearts of\r\nwilling learners.\r\n\r\nThe first hindrance was removed.\r\n\r\nA few days after the death of the Duchess, Père Pierre Lefevre of the\r\nCompany of Jesus arrived at Gandia, by previous arrangement, to lay the\r\nfoundation stone of the college which the Duke was building for the\r\nJesuits. He brought with him the Book of Spiritual Exercises written by\r\nthe General Padre Iñigo de Loyola. The Duke of Gandia took advantage of\r\nhis presence to perform these Spiritual Exercises, consisting of\r\nprayers, pious meditations, and rigorous and systematic searchings of\r\nthe heart. Feeling profited by this experience, he wrote to the Lord\r\nPaul P.P. III, begging Him to pronounce Apostolic Approval of the book.\r\nIn course of post, (which the Sixteenth Century carried on by means of\r\nprivate couriers,) that is to say in the course of a few months, he\r\nreceived from the Holiness of the Pope a Brief of Recommendation. The\r\nBull of Approval was issued on the thirty-first of July 1548.\r\n\r\nThis Brief caused him to resolve to join the Company of Jesus; and he\r\nwrote his resolution to the General without delay. When the death of his\r\nDuchess made him free to renounce the world, he seriously had thought of\r\nbecoming a Friar Minor. His name Francisco gave him San Francisco\r\nd’Assisi, the founder of the Religion of Friars Minor, as his\r\npatron-saint: the abject poverty, the singular contempt of the world,\r\nthe awful austerities of the Franciscans admirably agreed with his habit\r\nof mind. He consulted his resident chaplain who himself was a Friar\r\nMinor. To this friar, there came a vision of Madonna Mary saying, “Tell\r\nthe Duke to enter the Company of my Son.” To Duke Don Francisco, also, a\r\nstatue of Madonna Mary spoke the same words. Hence his final resolution.\r\n\r\nPadre Ribadaneira of the Company of Jesus, who, afterwards was his\r\nconfessor, and who wrote the life of the Duke of Gandia and swore before\r\nfive tribunals of the truth of every word that he had written, says (xv.\r\n238) that, for the next seven days, Duke Don Francisco was afflicted\r\nwith an apparition of a sumptuous mitre always floating above his head.\r\nHe had much fear. He knew that, when a person of his quality\r\nrelinquished a brilliant secular career, an equally brilliant\r\necclesiastical one lay open to him. This was the very last thing that he\r\ndesired. He swore to God that, unless the apparition left him, and he\r\nshould be allowed to practise poverty during his whole life yet to come,\r\nhe would refuse to don the clerical habit: for he felt the prospect of\r\ndignity to be a danger. Then the apparition left him: How exceedingly\r\nnatural is this example of unconscious cerebration. It would have been\r\nstrange indeed if the Duke’s crushed and bruised humanity had not\r\nasserted itself in phantasmal apparitions.\r\n\r\nThe singular reply of the General of the Company of Jesus shall be given\r\nin full. Its curious worldly care for the worldly welfare of worldly\r\npeople, its wonderful depth of spirituality for him who is spiritually\r\nminded, its complete grip of the subject, its polite piety, its discreet\r\njudgment, its personal humility, its impersonal dignity, its\r\nauthoritative decision, its quaint gravity of form, stamp it as the work\r\nof a great and powerful mind. Padre Iñigo de Loyola wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n  “MOST NOBLE LORD:—\r\n\r\n  “It gave me great delight to hear of the resolution with which God in\r\n  His Infinite Goodness has inspired you. Since we, who are on earth,\r\n  are unable to render Him sufficient thanks for the favour which He has\r\n  been pleased to show to our humble Company, in calling you to join it,\r\n  I humbly beseech the angels and the saints who are now enjoying His\r\n  Presence in heaven to supply our deficiency in this respect. I trust\r\n  that Divine Providence will cause this decision of yours to be the\r\n  means of effecting much good, not only in regard to your own soul, but\r\n  to the souls of many others who may be led to follow your example. As\r\n  for us who are already members of the Company, we shall strive to\r\n  serve with increased devotion the Gracious Father, who has given us so\r\n  skilled a labourer to aid in the work of cultivating the tender vine,\r\n  which He has been pleased to entrust to my care, although I am in\r\n  every respect unworthy of the office. In the name of the Lord, I\r\n  therefore receive you at once as our brother, and shall henceforth\r\n  regard you as such. Most truly can I promise to feel for you, now, and\r\n  always, an affection proportioned to the large-hearted generosity with\r\n  which you desire to enter the House of God, there to serve Him more\r\n  perfectly.\r\n\r\n  “With reference to your enquiries as to the time and manner of your\r\n  entrance into the Company, I have laid the matter before God in\r\n  prayer. It is my opinion that this change must be made with much\r\n  caution and deliberation, in order that you may not leave any of your\r\n  immediate duties unfulfilled; otherwise it may not prove to be\r\n  A.M.D.G. (Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam—_To The Greater Glory Of God_; the\r\n  motto of the Company of Jhesus.) You had better keep the affair a\r\n  secret at present; at least as far as it is possible to do, striving\r\n  meanwhile so to arrange things as to be free as soon as you can, and\r\n  at liberty to carry out the plan you so ardently desire to execute for\r\n  the love of our Lord.\r\n\r\n  “In order to make myself more plainly understood, I may as well say\r\n  that, as your daughters are of a marriageable age, I think you ought\r\n  to endeavour to see them suitably settled. It would be well if you\r\n  were also to choose a suitable wife for your eldest son, the Marquess\r\n  of Lombay. In regard to your other sons, it would be better not to\r\n  leave them dependent upon their elder brother: but to assign to each a\r\n  suitable and sufficient income of his own; allowing them meanwhile to\r\n  pursue their university career. It is reasonably to be hoped that, if\r\n  they fulfil, as I trust and believe they will, the promise of their\r\n  youth, the Emperor will extend to them the favour he has always shown\r\n  to you; and will bestow upon them, when the right time comes,\r\n  appointments in keeping with their rank. You must also try and push on\r\n  the various buildings you have begun; for I think it desirable that\r\n  they should all be completed, before the great change you are\r\n  contemplating is generally made known.\r\n\r\n  “Meanwhile, you cannot do better, since you are already a proficient\r\n  in most branches of human learning, than apply yourself to the study\r\n  of Theology. It is my wish that you should do this with much care and\r\n  pains; for I should like you to take a doctor’s degree in the\r\n  University of Gandia.\r\n\r\n  “I cannot conclude without inculcating upon you to take every possible\r\n  precaution in order to prevent this astonishing piece of news from\r\n  being prematurely divulged. I feel that I need add no more on this\r\n  head.\r\n\r\n  “I shall hope to hear frequently from you; and I will try to give you\r\n  all the advice and assistance you may need. In the meantime, I shall\r\n  beseech our Lord to grant you all graces and blessings, in\r\n  ever-increasing abundance.”\r\n\r\nThat truly is an extraordinary letter. The two men had never met. Only a\r\nfew letters at long intervals had passed between them; yet there is not\r\nthe slightest doubt or misunderstanding. The humble priest, readily but\r\nnot avidly, calmly but not arrogantly accepts the role of mentor to the\r\nbrilliant duke. He is very glad to get a duke—who will have done with\r\ndukedom: but he will allow no looking back when once the hand is put to\r\nthe plough. The severance must be absolute and irrevocable; and, to this\r\nend, Padre Iñigo de Loyola gives an exhibition of plain and practical\r\ncommon sense expressed in terms of courteous and definite command, _It\r\nis my wish_—_I think you ought_——.\r\n\r\nSo during the next four years the Duke of Gandia laboured to carry out\r\nthe orders of his ecclesiastical superior, removing the only hindrances\r\nthat bound him to the world. His late wife’s sister Doña Juana de\r\nMeneses acted as mother to his children. In 1548, he married his heir\r\nthe Marquess Don Carlos of Lombay, at the age of eighteen years, to Doña\r\nMagdalene de Centellas y Cardona, Countess of Oliva. In 1549, he married\r\nhis daughter Doña Isabella to Don Francisco de Sandoval y Rojas,\r\nMarquess of Denia and Count of Lerina. He finished the buildings of the\r\nDominican monastery at Gandia, and of the Jesuit College which is richly\r\nendowed with houses for poor scholars, and for children of the Maranas\r\nor Jews on condition of baptism. He also obtained charters from the Lord\r\nPaul P.P. III and from Caesar Carlos V. raising this college to the rank\r\nof an university.\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1550, he left his duchy of Gandia and journeyed toward Rome,\r\nescorted by a retinue of thirty servants, and his second son Don Juan de\r\nBorgia of the age of seventeen years. He had to pay the penalty of his\r\nextraordinary notoriety. On his passage through Ferrara, the reigning\r\nDuke (who himself came of Borgia stock) met him with fêtes and\r\nprocessions. At Florence, Duke Cosmo de’ Medici accorded a\r\nstate-reception. He was going to renounce the world; and the world made\r\na triumphal progress of his going. His desire to slink into the lowest\r\nplace won him attention verging on adoration. His chagrin was\r\nundisguised. He envoyed an avant-courier to ask his superior’s leave to\r\nenter Rome by night avoiding publicity. Padre Iñigo de Loyola\r\nperemptorily refused: for the Duke of Gandia was too good an\r\nobject-lesson to be thrown away. His entrance into the Eternal City,\r\nwhose citizens even in 1550 revered the memory of Borgia, was like that\r\nof a king who comes into his kingdom. The Lord Paul P.P. III sent\r\nambassadors to welcome him, and to offer lodging in the Apostolic Palace\r\nof the Vatican: but the Duke of Gandia hurried to the Jesuit College;\r\ndoing obeisance at the feet of the General and Founder of the Company of\r\nJesus. So these two unique personalities first met, whom now men call\r\nSaint Ignatius of Loyola, Saint Francis of Borgia.\r\n\r\nPadre Iñigo de Loyola immensely admired the Duke of Gandia. This last,\r\nwhose gracious and brilliant figure caused him to be compared to Apollo\r\nand gained for him the nickname The Modern Narcissus, already was known\r\nto fame as a ruler and orator born. He was the master of enormous wealth\r\nand influence; and his only ambition in life was to strip himself of\r\nthese and abnegate his will at the command of another. During his\r\nsojourn in Rome, he lavished his revenues on the foundation of the Roman\r\nCollege. The honourable title of Founder was offered to him by his own\r\nGeneral: but he begged to be excused; and the title afterwards was\r\naccepted by the Lord Gregory P.P. XIII, Who named the college The\r\nPontifical Gregorian University of Rome. Meanwhile, he sent a courier to\r\nAugsburg, where Caesar Carlos V was, with a letter in which he asked his\r\nsovereign’s leave to resign all his titles and estates. While he was\r\nwaiting for the reply, his General obliged him to fulfil all the duties\r\nof his ducal rank; whereby he was brought into intimate relations with\r\nthe Holiness of the Pope and the Curial Cardinals. Even in this august\r\nassemblage he won regard. The Pope and the cardinals became so fond of\r\nhim, that they disliked the notion of allowing so brilliant a man to\r\nbury himself in the severe Religion of Padre Iñigo de Loyola. It was a\r\nwaste of talent, they said; and the Supreme Pontiff proposed instantly\r\nto name him cardinal, like his dead brothers Don Rodrigo and Don Enrico.\r\n\r\nIt did appear to be a waste of talent. But that was a personal account\r\nwhich the Duke of Gandia would have to settle with his Judge. In these\r\nspecimens of abnormal humanity, interference invariably is fatal, owing\r\nto natural forces. It always is the safest and wisest plan, not to\r\nhinder, but to help a sane well-meaning man, who is aware of his\r\nresponsibilities, to do the thing which he wants to do. For human nature\r\nis capable of amazing outbreak, violence, and divarication, where it is\r\nnot free.\r\n\r\nAfter four months in Rome, suddenly, and with no leave-taking, the Duke\r\nof Gandia fled to Spain. The prospect of a scarlet hat had become too\r\nreal, too terrifying. Of course there is not the slightest danger that a\r\nman may be made cardinal against his expressed desire. The cardinalate\r\nis not an infectious disease like the plague, or scarlet fever; nor is\r\nit a sacrament, like baptism, which leaves an ineradicable mark upon the\r\nsoul. It conceivably is possible that only brutal rudeness and\r\nincivility will suffice for its avoidance:—but they will suffice. And it\r\ncan always be renounced, rare though renunciations be. The Duke of\r\nGandia was a very gracious lord, in full possession of all his\r\nfaculties, utterly uninfluenced; and, no doubt, he wished to avoid an\r\noccasion when his conscience would direct him to be ungracious or\r\nuncivil to the benevolence of the Holiness of the Pope. In his flight,\r\nhe first went to the castle of Loyola, where his General had been born,\r\nto thank Heaven for the nativity of that marvellous man: then, onward\r\nagain, a few miles to the little town of Oñata in Guipuscoa, where there\r\nwas a house of the Company of Jesus. The Lord Paul P.P. III died in Rome\r\nthis year 1550: and was succeeded by the Lord Julius P.P. III.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Gandia received a Brief from Caesar Carlos V, dated the\r\ntwelfth of February 1551, giving permission, to divest himself of rank\r\nand to renounce the world, with very much regret at losing the\r\nallegiance of his most brilliant subject, and solely because Caesar felt\r\nthat to refuse would be opposition to the Divine Will. He made the\r\nformal act of renunciation before a notary at Oñate; bestowing his\r\nduchy, his principalities, and his counties on his heir, the Marquess\r\nDon Carlos of Lombay; distributing his estates and wealth among his\r\nchildren. He laid aside his sword, which, according to the fashion of\r\nthe courtiers of Caesar Carlos V, he rode cock-horse, (so to speak,) as\r\nit hung between his legs. He had his hair cut short, and the tonsure\r\nshaved on his head. He changed his ducal robes for the shabby\r\nill-fitting black habit of a Jesuit. On Whit Saturday he was ordained\r\npriest; and the Duke of Gandia disappeared in Padre Francisco de Borja.\r\nIn his after life, he never would allow of any allusion to his former\r\nstyle, except when he chanced to hear of the refusal by the Company of\r\nJesus to admit a would-be but unsuitable novice, when he would say, “Now\r\nI thank God from the bottom of my heart for having made me a duke; for\r\nassuredly there was nothing else about me which could have induced the\r\nsuperiors to accept me”: an opinion which shews that Padre Francisco’s\r\nextremely poor opinion of himself betrayed him into exaggeration—a\r\nlittle human touch which brings him nearer to human understanding.\r\n\r\nHe said his first mass privately in the chapel of the castle of Loyola,\r\non the first of August 1551, the Festival of St. Peter’s Chains; and\r\ngave Holy Communion to his second son, Don Juan de Borja, who, having\r\nfound it hard to leave his father, was losing his young heart to Doña\r\nLorenza Oñaz de Loyola, heiress of the Señor Don Beltrano de Loyola.\r\n\r\nPadre Francisco’s second mass was a public function. All the people\r\nround about persisted in nicknaming him “Lo Santo Duque,” _The Holy\r\nDuke_. The Lord Julius P.P. III granted a plenary indulgence to all who\r\nshould assist at this mass, on the usual conditions of confession and\r\ncommunion. To satisfy the multitude the mass was to be said in the city\r\nof Vergara: but no church would hold the crowd, and the altar was\r\nerected in a field by the hermitage of Santa Ana. It began at nine\r\no’clock in the morning of the fifteenth of November 1551, and continued\r\ntill three in the afternoon, so overwhelming was the number of\r\ncommunicants. (The ordinary mass lasts half an hour.) The sermon was\r\npreached by Padre Francisco in the courtly Castilian dialect: but it is\r\nrecorded that people of all provinces understood him, even those whose\r\nnative tongue was Basque. A certain Don Juan de Moschera publicly cursed\r\nhim; to whom Padre Francisco instantly went, begging pardon for being\r\nworth a cursing.\r\n\r\nHe set up as a hermit in a wooden cell near the Jesuit House at Oñate;\r\nand gained fame as a preacher, especially (strange to say) among the\r\nlearned clergy. Men who take pleasure in approving of others, newcomers,\r\nof the same trade, are very rare: but for the clergy to approve of a\r\npreacher is rarer. He wrote a manual of Advice to Preachers, which had\r\nan unusual vogue. He was very fond of the breviary hymn _Vexilla Regis\r\nprodeunt_, (The Royal Banners forward go;) and repeated with delight of\r\nsoul the stanza,\r\n\r\n                      “_Arbor decora et fulgida,\r\n                      Ornata regis purpura:\r\n                      Electo digno stipite,\r\n                      Tam Sancta Membra tangere._\r\n\r\n “O Tree of glory, Tree most fair, ordained those Holy Limbs to bear;\r\n How bright in purple robe It stood, the purple of a Saviour’s Blood.”\r\n                                 (“Hymns Ancient and Modern.”)\r\n\r\nHe worked miracles. A lady had two splinters of wood; the one was\r\nunnotable, the other was a Relique of the True Cross: but which was the\r\nRelique was not known. Padre Francisco, to decide, broke them both; from\r\none, Blood dropped upon a piece of paper. An Infanta of Spain put him to\r\na similar test: but in this case the relique was said to be a piece of\r\nthe skin of St. Bartholomew Apostle (he was flayed alive), with another.\r\nPadre Francisco tore both skins; and again blood dropped from one on\r\nlinen. The blood-stained paper and the blood-stained linen, with both\r\nreliques, are in the monastery of Poor Clares at Madrid. Multitudes came\r\nto see the quondam duke as hermit; they said that they saw a radiant\r\nnimbus lighting the pallor of his brow; and to prevent Padre Francisco\r\nfrom becoming puffed up, (an excessively unnecessary precaution, one\r\nwould think,) his superior at Oñate, Padre Ochiva, set him to hard\r\nmenial labour, to dig, saw, carry stones, chop wood, light fires, help\r\nin the kitchen, and wheel barrows of manure. The General, to whom every\r\ndetail was reported, sent Padre Francisco to preach in Portugal, where\r\nthe Company of Jesus was little known; and his mission met with great\r\nresults. With himself he was most severe. All physical beauty was gone\r\nfrom his once gracious body, macerated in ceaseless austerities. He took\r\nthe habit of signing his letters _Francisco Pecador_, “Francis the\r\nSinner”: but his sapient General promptly stopped that practice, saying\r\nthat Singularity was not the seed of Sanctity. All letters which came to\r\nhim addressed to The Duke of Gandia, he returned, inscribed _Not for\r\nme_, _Francisco S.J._\r\n\r\nThe Lord Julius P.P. III issued a Brief, offering him a scarlet hat. He\r\nsent a firm refusal in reply. It has been said that he feared to accept\r\nthe cardinalate, lest he should be elected Pope at the next Conclave.\r\nThe statement is absurd; because\r\n\r\n  (α) in theory, the election of the Successor of St. Peter is the work\r\n        of the Holy Spirit; and _ubi Spiritus ibi libertas_, where the\r\n        Spirit is there is liberty: not cardinals alone, but humble\r\n        priests as well, or newly tonsured clerks, or any Christian\r\n        male, is eligible:—there is no such absurd thing as a\r\n        restriction on the Right of the Divinity to choose his Vicar;\r\n        and Padre Francisco, therefore, was as liable in black, as he\r\n        would have been in scarlet:\r\n\r\n  (β) if he had been elected Pope, it was open to him to refuse or to\r\n        accept the Call.\r\n\r\nSome Roman Catholics hold that he _could_ not have refused. But Popes\r\ncan abdicate, and have abdicated! But _would_ he have refused? Would he\r\nhave been allowed by the General of the Company of Jesus to refuse?\r\nThere is no knowing. Such a case has never occurred.\r\n\r\nThere never has been a Jesuit Pope. It would have been an unique, an\r\nunheard of situation,—the Company of Jesus in full power, armed with\r\nplenary authority, absolute in all the world, practising unscrupulous,\r\nuncompromising Christianity. The conditions of the Millennium would\r\nstand in a fair way of being fulfilled—to speak by the Book.—But Padre\r\nFrancisco de Borja refused the scarlet hat; for he wished for himself\r\ncomplete detachment from the world, and nothing more, here.\r\n\r\nReturning from his mission in Portugal to Spain, he evangelized the\r\nprovinces of Castile and Andalusia. At Alicaza, he healed a cripple\r\ngirl. At Valladolid, he raised the dead to life. Two teeth being knocked\r\nout of the head of a great preacher, his companion, they were replanted\r\nby Padre Francisco: and never old age nor decay affected them. The\r\nGeneral named him Provincial for Spain and the Indies; and Father and\r\nFounder of the Company of Jesus in Spain and Portugal. His preaching\r\nconverted the rich and worldly Bishop of Plasencia who returned to his\r\nreligious duties. Padre Francisco introduced the Company of Jesus at\r\nValladolid, Medina, San Lucar, Burgos, Granada, Plasencia, Murcia,\r\nSevilla, Valencia. Did he, in passing through Valencia, find any of the\r\nold stock of Don Juan Domingo de Borja who, exactly a century earlier,\r\nhad given the Lord Calixtus P.P. III to Rome and Christendom?\r\n\r\nHe was the first to establish the Jesuit Noviciates; and the Noviciate\r\nat Simancas was his favourite. Here are his methods of dealing with\r\nnovices. A certain novice of noble birth and breeding, but pious all the\r\nsame, found it intolerable that he should have to wait upon himself with\r\nno menial to truss his points, or brush his clothes, or sweep his floor\r\nto serve him. Padre Francisco heard his complaint; and, having there\r\nanother novice, who in the world had been a valet, he ordered him on his\r\nobedience to serve his noble brother. The thing was done; and in a\r\nlittle while, the noble novice sensibly took shame at his own\r\nsingularity, as might have been expected; and dispensed with further\r\nservice. Another noble novice found his narrow cell and his hebdomadal\r\nshirt altogether insupportable. Padre Francisco promptly furnished him\r\nwith a large room, and a clean shirt every day; and, presently, he grew\r\nto hate his privileges, renounced them, and assimilated himself with the\r\nrest. Padre Francisco at least believed what already has been said here,\r\nviz., that the wise man does not hinder, but helps the sane well-meaning\r\nman who is aware of his responsibilities, to do the thing that he\r\ndesires to do: for, if that thing be undesirable, the doer quickly will\r\nfind it out, and so convince himself; while the thing undone, the wish\r\nunsatisfied, causes the unconvinced to hanker after, to struggle for,\r\nand to revolt. Once when Padre Francisco was visiting the College of\r\nSant’ Andrea of Valladolid, the resources were at an end; and there was\r\nneither food nor money in the house. Natheless, he ordered the bell to\r\nbe rung as usual for supper though the board was bare; and, in the nick\r\nof time, there came to the outer door an old grey-headed man with a huge\r\nlovely boy, strangers in the city, who brought baskets of meat and bread\r\nand fish and eggs and wine, and a purse of money: whom the pious have\r\ncalled St. Andrew and an Angel.\r\n\r\nThe year 1555 saw three Popes; the Lord Julius P.P. III, Who died and\r\nwas succeeded by the Lord Marcellus P.P. II, Who died and was succeeded\r\nby the Lord Paul P.P. IV.\r\n\r\nIn 1556, Padre Iñigo de Loyola died; and Padre Francisco instantly began\r\nto invoke his departed chief,—_Holy Ignatius of Loyola, pray to the Lord\r\nour God for me_;—while Padre Jago Laynez was elected General of the\r\nCompany of Jesus.\r\n\r\nIn 1558, also died the Holy Roman Emperor Carlos V, who long had given\r\nhimself to religion. On his death-bed, Imperial Caesar cried for “santo\r\nPadre Francisco de Borja” to assist him in his agony. But the Jesuit was\r\nunable to arrive except in time to preach the funeral oration. Caesar\r\nhad shown to the priest the unparalleled respect and honour of naming\r\nhim executor of his will; an office which the unworldliness of Padre\r\nFrancisco impelled him to decline. The royal and imperial family,\r\nconscious of the κύδος which they would gain by his acceptance, appealed\r\nagainst his decision. The Princess-Regent also invoked the General, who\r\nissued a command upon obedience; which Padre Francisco perforce obeyed,\r\ncarried out the provisions of the will of Caesar Carlos V, taking as\r\nlittle as possible of his own share, to avoid offence. Of course, all he\r\nhad would go to the funds of his order, his vow of poverty debarring him\r\nfrom personal possessions.\r\n\r\nIn 1559, he was in Portugal once more, sick of an intermittent fever at\r\nEvora. The people of this country, natural enemies of Spain and\r\nSpaniards, so loved Padre Francisco that they said he must be a\r\nPortuguese. During his sickness, he wiled the weary waiting and cheered\r\nhis soul by setting music to the anthem _Regina caeli laetare_\r\n(“Rejoice, O Queen of Heaven”), and the hundred and seventy-six verses\r\nof Psalm cxviii, Vulgate Version, _Beati Immaculati_, (Psalm cxix,\r\nAuthorized Version, “Blessed are the undefiled in the way.”) This year,\r\nhis sister Dona Juana de Borja y Aragona (Suor Juana de la Cruz,) died\r\nIn The Odour of Sanctity. She was the first Abbess of the Royal\r\nMonastery of Sandalled (Discalced) Carmelites in Madrid. This year 1559,\r\ndied the Lord Paul P.P. IV and the Lord Pius P.P. IV succeeded Him. In\r\n1560, Padre Francisco calmed the terrified population of Oporto during a\r\ntotal eclipse of the sun, spontaneously preaching an impassioned sermon\r\non the eclipse, of mortal sin, which veils man’s soul from the Sun of\r\nRighteousness. Then, again, sickness laid him low; neuralgia, paralysis,\r\nulcers. The vile body was resisting the strain which he made it bear.\r\n\r\nRestored to health in 1561, he was summoned to Rome and named\r\nVicar-General of the Company of Jesus. Let it never be forgotten that,\r\nwhile the Borgia Pontiffs paved the way for, Padre Francisco de Borja\r\ngoverned the Jesuits throughout the world while the General Padre Jago\r\nde Laynez was present at, the Œcumenical of Trent. The connection\r\nbetween the House of Borgia and the Tridentine Decrees is of enormous\r\nsignificance. Here, at last, was the General Council for the Reformation\r\nof the Holy Roman Church, summoned and legally constituted by lawful\r\nauthority. For years, self-seeking malcontents, ecclesiastical and\r\nroyal, had howled for it. Now, it was come: but the German schism was an\r\naccomplished fact. The cry had gone through Christendom that Rome was\r\neffete, corrupt, on the verge of decay and dissolution. And lo, She\r\narose in Her strength, and cut away the parasitic ulcers that long had\r\nblurred with open wounds Her contours; refurbished spiritual arms long\r\nrusted; set Her house in order; and was ready again, like a giant\r\nrefreshed, for Her interminable affray. The Barque of Peter went into\r\ndock. The Garden of Souls was weeded. The Council of Trent reformed the\r\nHoly Roman Church: and a Borgia, as General’s deputy, was ruling the\r\nCompany of Jesus in all the world.\r\n\r\nDuring four years, Padre Francisco was Vicar-General in Rome. He\r\npreached often in the Spanish church of San Giuseppe on Via del\r\nMonserrato. The Religion of Padre Iñigo de Loyola endured one of its\r\nnumerous phases of attack. In this world, things being as they are, to\r\nsuch an institution a liability to disesteem is inevitable. Persecutors\r\nand calumniators arose; and Padre Francisco showed a talent for\r\nsuccessful defence. Having completely crushed himself, he could bring to\r\nhis cause an amount of irresistible force of which the ordinary man,\r\ndistracted by the whimsy interests of this and that, is altogether\r\nunaware.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Saint Francis Borgia._]\r\n\r\nHis behaviour, in one of those cases with which the Holy Roman Church\r\noccasionally shocks the world, is quite remarkable. His son Don Alvaro\r\nde Borja, who was about the age of twenty-seven years, and Ambassador of\r\nSpain in Rome, desired to marry Doña Laniparte de Almansa y Borja,\r\ndaughter of his own sister Doña Juana, and of the age of about fourteen\r\nyears. Padre Francisco refused to countenance a marriage between his\r\ngrand-daughter and his son, between uncle and niece: refused to ask the\r\nPope’s Holiness for the necessary dispensation. Whereupon, Don Alvaro\r\napproached the Lord Pius P.P. IV directly, in his capacity of\r\nambassador, and obtained the dispensation; while the Pope scolded Padre\r\nFrancisco for his conduct in the matter.\r\n\r\nIn 1565 Padre Jago Laynez died. Deliberately shutting their ears to his\r\nappeals, the Jesuits elected Padre Francisco de Borja Prepositor-General\r\nof the Company of Jesus on the second of July. With the single exception\r\nof the Roman Pontiff, he now was the most powerful ruler in Christendom,\r\ngeneral of an army unrivalled in discipline, utterly reliable, because\r\nvoluntarily enlisted and morally ruled. Yet he gave no sign of pride or\r\npleasure. He was a perfect Jesuit, humanely sensitive, completely\r\nself-distrustful. He said “It is evident that our Lord has condescended\r\nto assume the government of this Company since He sees fit to use so\r\ndeplorably unworthy an instrument.” What words could express more\r\nsincerely abject and unworldly humility than those?\r\n\r\n_Aut pati aut mori_ was his motto. As General, he relaxed not one of the\r\nstern rigorous austerities with which he kept under his body and brought\r\nit into subjection. Every passion and appetite of his human nature he\r\ndeliberately killed. He slept little. He ate little. He had freed\r\nhimself from every earthly love.\r\n\r\nWhat he might have been!\r\n\r\nWhat he was!\r\n\r\nA brilliant and gracious duke, master of territories and boundless\r\nwealth, father of a noble family allied with the bluest blood of Spain,\r\nhonoured by his sovereign, reverenced by his equals, loved by his kin,\r\nadored by his dependants.\r\n\r\nA sinister shadow of a man, wracked with continual pain, deliberately\r\napart from all his kind, feared, disliked, distrusted, alone,\r\nsuffering,—alone.\r\n\r\nEvery day he systematically meditated during five hours on superhuman\r\nthings. Every morning and every night, he subjected his conscience to\r\nrigorous examination, and confessed even every impulse to evil thought.\r\nHe prayed without ceasing. Once, when travelling in Spain with Padre\r\nBustamente, the two slept side by side on the bare floor of a loft,\r\nbecause there was no room for them in the inn. Padre Bustamente, being\r\nasthmatic, spat all night long, unknowingly on the face of his\r\ncompanion, who never moved. In the morning light, he was horrified to\r\nsee what he had done: but Padre Francisco consoled him, saying that in\r\nall the world no more suitable place could have been found. He had been\r\nvery urgent with his sister Doña Juana, Abbess of the Poor Clares at\r\nGandia, that she should persevere in penance and mortification till her\r\nlife’s end. Has there ever been a case of a consistent Roman Catholic\r\nwho has committed suicide from religious melancholomania? Rarely; if\r\never: for the Church, wisely recognising that peculiar temperament, has\r\nprovided a system where voluntary mortification has its places, its\r\nrules, and may be practised by whoever will.\r\n\r\nPadre Francisco had the gifts of intuition and of clear-seeing, which\r\ngenerally are found developed respectively in women and brute beasts. He\r\nknew when a house was about to fall some time before it fell. He knew,\r\non seeing a courier from his eldest son, that an heir was born to the\r\nDuke Don Carlos of Gandia. The courier did not relish this intuition,\r\nthinking that he deserved reward for his good news: of which disgust,\r\nalso, Padre Francisco was aware; and gave reward. _The greater the\r\ndetachment from the world, over worldly things the greater power is\r\ngained._ People who saw Padre Francisco during his generalship, saw rays\r\nof mysterious light playing round his head. The phenomenon of the\r\nelectric aura now is well-known; and the camera will show it on\r\noccasion. Often, in his trances of prayer, he was seen floating above\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nIn 1566 the Lord Pius P.P. IV died; and, succeeding Him, the Lord Pius\r\nP.P. V. stopped his coronation procession at the Jesuit House in Rome,\r\nthat He might pay His respects to the holy General. In 1569 Padre\r\nFrancisco again was stricken with fever. Recovering, he made a\r\npilgrimage to the Holy House of Nazareth, which angels carried over the\r\nsea from Palestine and set down at Loreto by Ancona. In 1571 the Pope’s\r\nHoliness sent an embassage to France and Spain and Portugal, to rouse\r\nthe sovereigns of Christendom against the Muslim Infidel. The\r\nambassadors were the Papal Nephew, the Lord Michele Bonello, son of\r\nMadonna Gardina the Pope’s sister, born at Boschi near Alessandria, who\r\nat his august Uncle’s first creation in 1566 had been named\r\nCardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Maria _sopra Minerva_ with the\r\ncognomen Alessandrino; and Padre Francisco de Borgia, Prepositor-General\r\nof the Company of Jesus. The two left Rome in 1571. In Barcelona, they\r\nsettled a long-standing dispute between the government and the cathedral\r\nchapter; for Padre Francisco was ever a peacemaker. In the province of\r\nCataluna, which was not unmindful of him who had been its viceroy, the\r\nambassadors were received with the highest honour.\r\n\r\nThe record of this journey, through the scenes of his youthful glory, is\r\none of the most pathetic things in human history. This sinister\r\nemaciated phantom shabbily robed in thread-bare black, whose thin lips\r\nbit perpetual pain; this great and narrow spirit with eyes tardy and\r\ngrave, furtively, drowsily, reluctantly, regarding earthly things,\r\nhaving seen the heavenly; this mendicant, whose companion was a prince\r\nof the church sumptuous in ermine and vermilion,—he was no stranger in\r\nCataluna, where aforetime as marquess, duke, and imperial viceroy he had\r\nexercised despotic and sovereign rule. Now he thought no place low\r\nenough, foul enough, for his deserts. He was in, but not of, the world.\r\n\r\nAt Valencia, his children and his grandchildren knelt to kiss his\r\nway-worn feet. They prayed him to visit his duchy of Gandia. He refused.\r\nHe was no longer of the world.\r\n\r\nHe preached for the last time in the cathedral of Valencia—Valencia the\r\nshrine of the House of Borja. Here, a century and a half earlier, Canon\r\nAlonso de Borja had been raised to the bishopric. The Bishop of Valencia\r\nbecame cardinal. The Cardinal of Valencia became the strenuous Lord\r\nCalixtus P.P. III. From Xativa by Valencia sprang Don Rodrigo de Lançol\r\ny Borja, Bishop of Valencia, Cardinal of Valencia, the magnificent\r\ninvincible Lord Alexander P.P. VI. The splendid Don Cesare (detto\r\nBorgia) also was Bishop of Valencia and Cardinal, before he renounced\r\nthe purple for the French duchy of Valentinois. Three huge personalities\r\nhad borne the name that now was represented by this obscure wan figure\r\nwhose voice, whose magic pleading fading voice, thrilled in the aisles\r\nof Valencia’s fane. Here, in Valencia, the fire was kindled; hence, from\r\nValencia, blazed the all-devouring flame; here, in Valencia, the cresset\r\nglowed with steady brilliant light, so shining before men that they\r\nmight see good works, and glorify the Father which is in heaven. Padre\r\nFrancisco de Borja preached for the last time in the cathedral of\r\nValencia.\r\n\r\nIn France, the ambassadors met with no success. That miserable country\r\nwas in the throes of the Huguenot Rebellion; and the Queen Dowager,\r\nMadame Caterina de’ Medici, ruled the maniac King. After travelling\r\nthrough France in the winter, gaining converts and confirming the\r\nchurches, but failing in the object of their journey, the ambassadors\r\nreached Turin; and became guests of the Duke of Savoy. Padre Francisco,\r\nutterly worn out with exertion and anxiety, his vital forces being on\r\nthe verge of exhaustion, fell ill on the second of February, Candlemas\r\nDay 1572. The exigencies of courtly etiquette bored him to distraction;\r\nand he hurried on. Low Sunday found him in Ferrara. Here, having\r\nconcluded his ambassadorial duties, the last remains of his strength\r\ndeparted. His nephew, the Duke of Ferrara, gave him a royal escort, and\r\na royal litter, as he was too weak to ride, and sent him onward to Rome.\r\nDuring this last journey, it was noticed that, though he lay still, more\r\nlike a corpse than a man, his characteristic gesture of command remained\r\nwith him to the very end.\r\n\r\nHe attained the Flaminian Gate of Rome on the twenty-eighth of\r\nSeptember. All the Company of Jesus were there to receive their dying\r\nGeneral. He was carried to the Jesuit House, and the last Sacraments of\r\nUnction and Viaticum fortified his soul.\r\n\r\nOn the Festival of St. Michael Archangel, he lay a-dying. The next day,\r\nhis speech departed. His last words, the last words of the sometime\r\ngracious and brilliant duke, the last words of the Jesuit General, were\r\nthe words of a simple little Christian child, “I long for Jesus!”\r\n\r\nHe had done with the Latin of the Church. He had gone back to his\r\nmother-tongue, “A Jesus quiero.”\r\n\r\nOn the first of October 1572, he died of a decline, being of the age of\r\ntwo and sixty years.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInstantly, the pious opinion was entertained that Padre Francisco de\r\nBorja had died In The Odour of Sanctity.\r\n\r\nIt was found impossible to undress the corpse. Among others, his brother\r\nDon Tommaso de Borja, the Viceroy of Aragon, made an attempt to perform\r\nthe last duties, but all without success. This same Don Tommaso, who\r\nafterwards became Archbishop of Saragossa, wrote a detailed history of\r\nthis phenomenon which he calls miraculous. Various explanations are\r\ngiven of the sudden and complete _rigor mortis_, which, however, are\r\nmystical, not practical ones. It is said that modesty prevented the\r\ndisrobing, or that it was intended to hide the scars of long-practised\r\nausterities, or that the greatest reverence was due to the body which\r\nhad been the temple of the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nHis family, and all who in his life had known him, looked upon Padre\r\nFrancisco de Borja as a saint: as such, they privately venerated his\r\nfragrant memory, and invoked the aid of his intercession. No public\r\nhonours were accorded, for his right to these had not yet been made\r\nclear: but it was alleged that these private invocations produced\r\nmarvellous results. Two shall be named. The physicians attending the\r\nDuchess of Uzeda in child-bed found themselves unable to effect delivery\r\nowing to congenital malformation. After the invocation of the dead\r\nJesuit, instant safe and painless delivery took place with perfect\r\nhealth to mother and child. Queen Doña Margarita, wife of King Don\r\nFelipe III of Spain, endured puerperal fever. The invocation of Padre\r\nFrancisco brought a cure. Then, and with these credentials, the Company\r\nof Jesus formally petitioned the Papal Nuncio in Spain, Monsignor Decio\r\nCarafa afterwards Cardinal, to order an enquiry into the virtues and\r\nmiracles of the Servant of God, their departed General. Five tribunals\r\nwere found at Valencia, Madrid, Barcelona, Saragossa, and Recanati;\r\nmultitudes of witnesses were examined and cross-examined. Padre\r\nRibadaneira, confessor of the deceased, confirmed on oath his book on\r\nthe life of Padre Francisco de Borja. From this book, many of the\r\nforegoing facts are taken. In 1615, after thirty-seven years’ labour,\r\nthe proceedings of the five tribunals in writing were sent to Rome,\r\nwhere Spain’s ambassador presented them to the Lord Paul P.P. V with\r\nrecommending letters from King Don Felipe III, the Grandees and Hidalgos\r\nof Spain, archbishops and bishops, cathedral chapters, municipalities,\r\nand universities.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Pontiff was pleased to refer the matter to the Sacred\r\nCongregation of Rites, the Roman tribunal competent to deal with such a\r\ncase. Before this court, all evidence was verified; and a decree was\r\nissued attesting the orthodoxy of the teaching of the Venerable Servant\r\nof God, his sanctity of life, and the authenticity of the alleged\r\nmiracles, satisfactorily to have been proved; and granted permission to\r\nproceed to Beatification. The Lord Paul P.P. V confirmed this decree;\r\nand named three Apostolic Commissioners to carry on the cause in Spain.\r\nThe proceedings of a Royal Commission are so well understood, that it\r\nmerely is necessary to say that the business of an Apostolic Commission\r\nis to search for information, to hear and weigh evidence, and to compile\r\na report on a given subject.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the claims of Spain to possess the remains of her renowned\r\nson were recognized; and on the twenty-third of February 1617, the body\r\nof the Venerable Francisco de Borja, (except an arm retained at the Gesù\r\nin Rome,) was translated to the chapel of the Jesuit House in Madrid.\r\n\r\nIn 1623, the eight years labours of the Apostolic Commission were\r\nconcluded; and brought to the usual scrutiny in Rome. Later, the verdict\r\nwas given to the effect that the sanctity and miracles of the Venerable\r\nFrancisco de Borja fully had been established; and that, therefore, he\r\nwas worthy of Beatification: which decision duly was confirmed by the\r\nLord Gregory P.P. XV.\r\n\r\nThirty-one years later, on the thirty-first of August 1654, a decree in\r\naccord with this decision was issued by the Sacred Congregation of\r\nRites, and ratified by the Lord Urban P.P. VIII[111], Who, on the\r\ntwenty-fourth of November, published the Bull of Beatification with the\r\nOffice and Mass in honour of the Blessed Francisco de Borja for the\r\nUniversal Church.\r\n\r\nAnother seventeen years of public prayers and legal action passed; and\r\non the eleventh of April 1671, the Lord Clement P.P. XI solemnly\r\ncanonized Saint Francisco de Borja, adding to the Roman Martyrology,\r\nwhich is the official roll of sanctitude, the three lines, in which the\r\nHoly Roman Catholic Church delivers Her authoritative judgment, and of\r\nwhich the following is a literal translation: “_Sixth day of the Ides of\r\nOctober. This day, at Rome, is kept the festival of Saint Francisco of\r\nBorja, Repositor-General of the Company of Jesus, memorable, having\r\nabdicated secular things and refused dignities of the Church, by\r\nasperity of life, by the gift of prayer._\r\n\r\nIn 1680, the reliques of the saint were translated to the gorgeous\r\nchurch in Madrid which the Duke of Lerma built A.M.D.G. To the Greater\r\nGlory of God, and of his ancestor St. Francisco de Borja. So, a century\r\nafter his death, a Borgia was numbered with the Saints.\r\n\r\nRational human judgment may be glad to stand aside before the sober\r\njudgment of the Church, so far removed from bias, from ecstatic\r\nextravagance, so calmly judicially personal. She has divined all, and is\r\nreticent. She has settled his key, She has struck his note, and is\r\nsufficient. She has shewn him in an _Ideal Content_. He “left all”; and\r\nfor that She honours him: and She has Scriptural Warrant.\r\n\r\n“An accomplished courtier, a clever diplomatist, a brilliant and\r\ngracious viceroy, a perfect religious.\r\n\r\n“A masterful imperious character—in breaking his own will he broke\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“A magnified non-natural man.\r\n\r\n“Saint Francisco de Borja—Memorable—By asperity of life—By the gift of\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\n“Memorable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Ashes\r\n\r\n  “_A fire, that is kindled, begins with smoke and hissing, while it\r\n      lays hold on the faggots; bursts into a roaring blaze, with raging\r\n      tongues of flame, devouring all in reach, spangled with sparks\r\n      that die; settles into the steady genial glare, the brilliant\r\n      light, that men call fire: burns away to slowly-expiring ashes_;—\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the birthday to the Life eternal of St. Francisco de Borja, the\r\nSpanish Branch of the House in his direct descendants increased and\r\nmultiplied; intermarried with the grandest names in Spain; and decreased\r\nin importance, until its extinction in the penultimate decade of the\r\nlast century. Four only, of these, need be mentioned here.\r\n\r\nDon Gaspard de Borja was a great-grandson of the Saint, and son of Duke\r\nDon Francisco de Gandia by his wife Doña Juana de Velasco Tovar. He\r\nstudied at the Complutensian University, becoming a Laureate in Theology\r\nand Dean of the University. He was the first Grandee of Spain to occupy\r\nthe Chair of Professor and Public Lecturer. At the instance of the\r\nCatholic King, he obtained a Canonry at the Metropolitan Cathedral of\r\nToledo; and here he began to nourish the enormous ambition of becoming\r\nthe third Pope of the House of Borgia.[112]\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth of August 1611, he was named Cardinal-Presbyter of\r\nthe Title of Santa Croce _in Gerusalemme_, being then a youth;\r\n“invenis,” says Ciacconi; twenty-two years of age, says the exact and\r\nuniquely well-informed Moroni. On the fifteenth of May 1630, he was\r\nraised to the Cardinal-Bishopric of Albano, and named Archbishop of\r\nSeville. In Rome, he was on the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office,\r\nand ambassador of the Catholic King to the Holy See. In the Kingdom of\r\nNaples, he was Viceroy. He bought, (Mr. Henry Harland wittily says that\r\none may buy such things,) the additional title of “Father of the Poor,”\r\nby distributing annually in charity ten thousand crowns; and he\r\nexchanged his archbishopric of Seville for that of Toledo. In 1641, he\r\nheld a diocesan synod over which his Vicar-General presided as his\r\nproxy, and governed his archdiocese, while he was cultivating his\r\nambition in Rome. He was an unwilling assistant at the two Conclaves,\r\nwhich elected the Lord Gregory P.P. XV and the Lord Urban P.P. VIII. And\r\nin November 1645, while England was in the throes of the Great\r\nRebellion, he died at Madrid, after fifty-six years of life, and\r\nthirty-four of cardinalate, a disappointed man, and was buried in the\r\nmetropolitan cathedral of Toledo.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDon Francisco de Borja, great-great-grandson of the Saint, son of Duke\r\nDon Carlos de Gandia by his wife Doña Maria Ponce de Leon, was born on\r\nthe twenty-seventh of March 1659. He was a man of singular and\r\nextraordinary piety and learning, Archdeacon of Calatrava and Canon of\r\nToledo. By his proved fidelity he gained the favour of the Catholic King\r\nDon Carlos II, who made him Councillor of Aragon. From Rome, he received\r\nthe bishopric of Calagurita; and (on the fourteenth of November 1699,\r\naccording to Moroni, or on the twenty-first of June 1700, according to\r\nGuarnacci,) the scarlet hat of the cardinalate and the archbishopric of\r\nBurgos. He died on the fourth of April 1702, undistinguishable from\r\nother ecclesiastics of his rank.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDon Carlos de Borja was brother to the foregoing. Born at Gandia his\r\nfamily’s fief on the thirtieth of April 1653 (Moroni), or 1663\r\n(Guarnacci,) he studied theology at the college of Sant’ Ildefonso, and\r\nsucceeded his brother as Archdeacon of Calatrava and Canon of Toledo. On\r\nthe death of Archbishop Don Pedro de Portocarrero, the Lord Clement P.P.\r\nXI named him Archbishop of Tyre and Trebizond _in partibus infidelium_;\r\na see held at the present moment by an Englishman who is the ornament of\r\nthe “Black” drawing-rooms of Rome. From Tyre and Trebizond, Archbishop\r\nDon Carlos de Borja rose to the Patriarchate of the Indies, continuing\r\nto reside in Spain where he shewed piety and zeal as chaplain and\r\nalmoner to the Catholic King Don Felipe V. On the thirtieth of September\r\n1720, he was raised to the Sacred College; and in his capacity of\r\ncardinal, hurried to Rome for the Conclave of 1721. There, he found\r\nalready elected and crowned, the Lord Innocent P.P. XIII, who named him\r\nCardinal-Presbyter of the Title of Santa Pudenziana, and placed him on\r\nthe Sacred Congregations of The Index of Prohibited Books, of\r\nIndulgences, of Signaturae Gratiae. He died at the Royal Villa of Sant’\r\nIldefonso near Madrid on the eighth of August 1733, and honourably was\r\nburied there. He has left nothing of his personality, save a physically\r\neffete but beautiful gentle generous shadowy visage, in his portrait\r\npainted by Procaccini, and engraved by Rossi in Guarnacci II. 357–8.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo the Senior Branch, in the line of the direct descendants of the\r\nmurdered Duke of Gandia, bastard of the Lord Alexander P.P. VI, withered\r\nin sumptuous obscurity; heaping up secular titles and estates by\r\nmarriage, heaping up ecclesiastical dignity and preferment by the\r\nenchantment of the Borja name added to personal merit, until its final\r\nextinction only eighteen years ago. The names and titles of the last of\r\nthe Spanish Borja, here recorded, will shew what that House had\r\naccumulated in a bare four hundred years—three principalities, seven\r\nduchies, ten marquessates, sixteen counties, and one viscounty, besides\r\nknightly orders and decorations.\r\n\r\nHis name was\r\n\r\n  Don Mariano Tellez-Giron y Beaufort Spontin Pimentel de Quiñones\r\n      Fernandes de Velasco y Herrera Diego Lopez de Zuñiga Perez de\r\n      Guzman Sotomayor Mendoza Maza Ladrón de Lizana Carroz y Arborea\r\n      Borja y Centelles Ponce de Leon Benavides Enriquez Toledo\r\n      Salm-Salm Hurtado de Mendoza y Orozco Silva Gomez de Sandoval y\r\n      Rojas Pimentel y Osorio Luna Guzman Mendoza Aragon de la Cerda\r\n      Enriquez Haro y Guzman.\r\n\r\nHis titles were\r\n\r\n  Prince of Squillace[113], Eboli, Melito;\r\n\r\n  Duke of Osuna, Infantado, Benevente, Plasencia, Béjar, Gandia, Arcos\r\n      de la Frontera, Medina de Rioseco y Lerma;\r\n\r\n  Marquess of Tavara, Santillana, Algecilla, Argüesco, Gibraleon,\r\n      Zahara, Lombay, Peñafiel, Almenara y Cea;\r\n\r\n  Count of Benevente, Plasencia, Béjar, Gandia, Arcos de la Frontera,\r\n      Medina de Rioseco y Lerma, Real de Manzanares, La Oliva,\r\n      Belaleazar, Ureña, Casares, Melgar, Baiten, Mayorga y Fontenar;\r\n\r\n  Viscount of La Puebla de Alcocer.\r\n\r\nHe was Ten Times Grandee of Spain of the First Class, Knight of the\r\nOrders of Calatrava, of St. John of Jerusalem, of the Golden Fleece,\r\nKnight Grand Cross and Collar of the Orders of Carlos V, of St.\r\nHermenegild, of St. Alexandra Newski, of the Christ of Portugal, of the\r\nCrown of Bavaria, of the Legion of Honour, etc., etc., etc.,\r\n\r\nHe died without issue on the second of June 1882.[114]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =Book the Fourth=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       A Flicker from the Embers\r\n\r\n  _A fire, that is kindled, begins with smoke and hissing, while it lays\r\n      hold on the faggots; bursts into a roaring blaze, with raging\r\n      tongues of flame, devouring all in reach, spangled with sparks\r\n      that die; settles into the steady genial glare, the brilliant\r\n      light, that men call fire: burns away to slowly-expiring ashes;\r\n      save where smouldering embers flicker, and nurse the glow_,—\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile St. Francisco de Borja was his contemporary in the Spanish Branch,\r\nDon Pietro Borgia, (the great-grandson of that Don Pietrogorio Borgia\r\nwho was the Trusty familiar of Duke Cesare de Valentinois della Romagna\r\nand Viceroy of the Abruzzi,) was living in Velletri on the frontier of\r\nthe Regno, the little Volscian city where his family had been settled\r\nsince Don Niccolo Borgia was its Regent in 1417. He married Madonna\r\nFilomena—_gentildonna molto pia_, is the sweet breath of her, which\r\nArchbishop Bonaventura Theuli has preserved for us,[115]—and had three\r\nchildren:\r\n\r\n  (α) The youngest son, Don Polidoro Borgia, died in his youth, the year\r\n        before St Francisco de Borgia died General of Jesuits in Rome.\r\n        His epitaph, in the porch of Santa Maria del Trivito at\r\n        Velletri, is as follows\r\n\r\n                                D .

III, 1181–1185. (_Ricchi._)\r\nLater, he went to his uncle the Prince-Archbishop Alessandro Borgia of\r\nFermo, with whom he lived, and under whom he studied, till the latter’s\r\ndeath in 1756. The nature of this education can be judged from Don\r\nStefano’s after-life in which he cut so noble a figure as ecclesiastic,\r\ndiplomatist, ruler, scholar, archæologist, man of letters, and Christian\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nAt the age of nineteen years, he had written a learned little treatise\r\non the monument of the Lord John P.P. XVI; and a Short History of the\r\nancient city of Tadino in Umbria, with an exact account of the latest\r\nresearches among its ruins, two octavo volumes published in Rome 1750–1:\r\nso that when he arrived in the Eternal City after his uncle’s death, he\r\nfound himself appreciated not only for his illustrious name, but also\r\nfor the crescent ability of which he had given evidence. Three years\r\nlater, in 1759, he was named Governor of the city and duchy of\r\nBenevento, the pontifical fief formerly occupied by another Borgia, the\r\nmurdered Duke of Gandia. Here he wrote his Historical Memorials of the\r\nPontifical City of Benevento from the Eighth to the Eighteenth Century,\r\nin three quarto volumes published in Rome 1763–9. In 1764 he was\r\nsecretary to the Sacred Congregation On Indulgences. In 1765, at the age\r\nof thirty-four years, his hands were anointed and he received the order\r\nof priesthood. In 1770 he was named Secretary _a secretis_ to the Sacred\r\nCongregation of the Propagation of the Faith, (v. title-page of his _De\r\nCruce_.)\r\n\r\nHis career was now well-begun; and he had time to pursue his favourite\r\noccupations of letters and archæology. Writing under his initials S. B.,\r\nhe published in 1773 his discovery of a Venetian Kalendar of the\r\nEleventh Century from a vellum MS., and a Koptic and Latin Fragment of\r\nthe Acts of St. Koluthus. In 1774, he published an edition of the Lord\r\nPius P.P. II’s (Enea Silvio) work, _Against the Turks_. In 1775 the\r\nSignor Abbate Stefano Borgia addressed to the Etruscan Academies of\r\nCortona and Florence, a duodecimo Philological Dissertation on an\r\nantique gem-intaglio, “la pregiabile vetusta agata—la bella e rara\r\ngemma—Gemma Borgiana—”; which the celebrated and learned antiquary\r\nMartinello, in a letter to Padre Ignazio della Croce a sandalled\r\nAugustinian, calls _most scholarly and precious_. In 1776 he produced a\r\nwork in quarto on the Shrine of St. Peter in the Vatican Basilica. In\r\n1779, he published a folio on the curious Cross of the Vatican which is\r\nvenerated on Good Friday, with the Syriac Rite of Salutation of the\r\nCross, all most learnedly set forth and illustrated with notes and\r\ncommentaries.\r\n\r\nHe did not forget his House, or his native city of Velletri: for he\r\nestablished there the Borgia Museum of Antiquities, which chiefly was\r\nfamous for the Mexican Codex of his presentation, lately found worthy to\r\nbe produced in facsimile in Rome with a splendour and importance\r\nunapproachable by English publishers.\r\n\r\nIn 1780, he brought out his quarto on the Ancient Cross of Velletri, “a\r\ncross-full of reliques conserved in the cathedral with much decency.”\r\n(_Theuli II._ 158.) It is a curious and luscious work, which relates the\r\nhistory of the Cross, a fine gold piece encrusted with large single\r\npearls (unionibus) and other gems, from the middle of the Thirteenth\r\nCentury, when it was given to the Veliternian Cathedral of St. Clement\r\nby the Lord Alexander P.P. IV, who, before His election was known as the\r\nLord Rainaldo de’ Conti di Segni,[122] Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia and\r\nVelletri.[123] The year 1788, saw the issue of a new quarto from his\r\ngifted pen, being a Short History of the Temporal Dominion of the\r\nApostolic See in the Two Sicilies; which went into a second edition the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nBut at this point, the year of the French Revolution, the fortunes of\r\nthe Abbate Stefano Borgia took a signal turn opening limitless\r\npossibilities. The Lord Pius P.P. VI named him Cardinal-Presbyter of the\r\nTitle of San Clemente, in the Consistory of the thirtieth of March 1789;\r\nand promoted him from the secretariate of Propaganda to the Prefectures\r\nof the Sacred Congregation of Index and of the Pontifical Gregorian\r\nUniversity of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe cardinalitial scarlet is the proper setting for this noble\r\npersonage. The Most Eminent Lord Stefano Cardinal Borgia becomes at once\r\na type of the huge and sumptuous princes of the church, to whom letters\r\nand the fine arts lend their glamour. “Quest’ Amplissimo Porporato,” as\r\nhis friend and biographer the sandalled Carmelite Fra Pietro Paolino da\r\nSan Bartolomeo calls him, had the two marks whereby the perfect\r\ngentleman and scholar universally may be known. He had a pretty taste\r\nfor letters, a habit of acquiring rare books and manuscripts; and was\r\nhimself a writer of extreme distinction. He had also a passion for\r\ncollecting beautiful and singular things, especially engraved gems. The\r\nmagic of carven precious stones enchanted him, as camei and intaglii\r\never have enchanted men of delicate and powerful mental mould. The times\r\nin which he lived were not convenient for the cultivation of these\r\nexquisite tastes: but it is in no case desirable that they should be\r\ncultivated. They lead nowhere, neither to heaven, nor to hell.\r\nEssentially they have no relation to the work of life, or death; and it\r\nis not well that they should usurp attention—for there are greater\r\nthings. But the possession of these tastes is an imperative necessity to\r\nhim who would do those greater things; for they bring, as nought else\r\nbrings, the habit of discrimination, of selection, of appreciation; they\r\nrefine and temper and grace the steel with which the greater deeds of\r\nlife, and death, are done: and, so, their only end is served; while he\r\nwho has them in the nature of him, not laboriously acquired but\r\ncongenitally possessed, is the better man, the more capable man, the\r\nmore enduring, skilful, potent, and triumphant man, and, correlatively,\r\nthe happier man. Cardinal Stefano Borgia, then, having this gentle\r\ngenerous love for books and precious stones, most naturally became one\r\nof the most distinguished ecclesiastics of his age.\r\n\r\nIn 1791, he published as a supplement to his Short History, a learned\r\nquarto in Defence of the Temporal Dominion of the Apostolic See in the\r\nTwo Sicilies. To this, he added, in 1793, a treatise on two Koptic\r\nsaints, Koluthus and Panesnice, whose original Acts were in his\r\npossession. But it chiefly was as cardinal of the Curia, as Protector of\r\nReligious, as Ruler and Governour, as Proprefect of Propaganda (to which\r\nhe was appointed in 1798,) that he manifested his ability and sterling\r\nworth. When the armies of Revolutionary France invaded Italy, engaging\r\nin those extravagant monstrosities of turpitude which habitually\r\ndisgrace the French toward the close of every century, His Eminence\r\nallowed nothing of war or tumult to disturb the serene and strenuous\r\nperformance of his multifarious offices. In those horrid times, when\r\nanother or lesser man would have been paralysed, he retired with superb\r\ndignity from Rome to Padua, whence he continued to administer and govern\r\nnot his own estates only, but all the foreign dioceses and missions\r\nthroughout the world which were subject to Propaganda. And it was here\r\nin Padua that he quietly found time to do a beautiful and noble deed, by\r\nwhich alone, had he done nothing else, he would have prepared for\r\nhimself a more illustrious name.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the College of Cardinals contained a certain August\r\nPersonage, an Englishman of paramount importance.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the Revolution of 1688, King James II Stewart had been driven\r\nfrom his kingdom of England by the Prince of Orange, His Majesty took\r\nrefuge in France. His son Prince James, vulgarly called the Old\r\nPretender, unsuccessfully warred for his rights in 1715; and, on the\r\ndeath of his father, assumed in exile his birthright with the style,\r\nJames III D.G. of Great Britain France and Ireland King F.D. King James\r\nIII had two sons,—observe the admirable insouciant carriage of head on\r\ntheir medals as boys. The elder, Prince Charles Edward, as Prince of\r\nWales, vulgarly called the Young Pretender, advanced his father’s claim\r\nto the crown of England by force of arms in 1745. The result was the\r\nMassacre of Culloden Moor. The younger, Prince Henry Benedict, the Duke\r\nof York, was a priest. Hunted from France by Hanoverian diplomacy, King\r\nJames III found refuge in Rome, where, at length, he died; the Prince of\r\nWales succeeding him as King Charles III. Prince Henry Benedict\r\nmeanwhile rose in ecclesiastical rank through the Cardinal-Bishopric of\r\nOstia and Velletri (Cardinal Borgia’s city), to the Cardinal-Bishopric\r\nof Tusculum and the Vicechancellorship of the Holy Roman Church. His\r\nmedal, by Filippo Cropanesi, dated 1766, shows his royal Stewart\r\nprofile, still with the admirable high carriage of head, and the legend\r\n\r\n         HENRICUS M.D. EP. TUSC. CARD. DUX. EBOR S.R.E.V. CANC.\r\n\r\nIn 1788, his brother, King Charles III, died at Rome; and was buried\r\nwith his father in the crypt of the Vatican Basilica. As he left no\r\nlegitimate heirs, his rights in the Majesty of England devolved upon\r\nCardinal Henry Benedict Stewart, who was known as His Royal Highness the\r\nCardinal-Duke of York. This Personage combined with transcendent beauty\r\nand truly royal demeanour, rare and solid virtue and the extreme of good\r\nsense. Nothing could have been more perfectly kingly than his easy and\r\nready realization of his situation. He was aware, as well of his\r\nhereditary rights, as of the fact that his subjects, having settled down\r\nunder an usurping dynasty, had disowned and would disown his claims on\r\ntheir allegiance. He had seen war in his path. He had no insatiable\r\ncraving for a crown. He arrived at a decision absolutely luminously\r\nwise. That the rights of his dynasty should suffer no diminution, by\r\nrenunciation on his part, he made a technical assertion of his\r\nsovereignty, proclaiming his accession in such a way that the usurpation\r\nof his throne by the Elector of Hanover, (vulgarly called George III)\r\nshould be undisturbed, _except by England’s Will_. He caused a medal to\r\nbe struck, bearing on the obverse His Majesty’s effigy in a cardinal’s\r\nhabit with zucchetto and the pectoral-cross of his episcopate,—the\r\nkingly head is drooping now—; with the legend\r\n\r\n HENRY THE NINTH, OF GREAT BRITAIN FRANCE AND IRELAND KING, DEFENDER OF\r\n    THE FAITH, CARDINAL-BISHOP OF TUSCULUM.\r\n\r\nThe reverse shows a design of Faith, at whose feet are the cardinalitial\r\nhat and kingly crown, and who turns from the Lion to the Cross; with the\r\nlegend\r\n\r\n           NOT BY THE DESIRES OF MEN BUT BY THE WILL OF GOD.\r\n\r\nAt the same time was struck a touch-piece, for distribution among the\r\nfew loyal English who had not bowed the knee to Hanoverian Baal, and for\r\ncuring those afflicted with struma or _kings evil_; an occult power\r\nwhich died with this last Stewart. The obverse bears a design of a\r\nfrigate with the legend\r\n\r\n HENRY THE NINTH, OF GREAT BRITAIN FRANCE AND IRELAND, KING BY THE GRACE\r\n    OF GOD, DEFENDER OF THE FAITH, CARDINAL-BISHOP OF TUSCULUM.\r\n\r\nThe reverse shows St. Michael Archangel overcoming the Dragon, with the\r\nlegend\r\n\r\n                         TO GOD ALONE BE GLORY.\r\n\r\nAnd that was all,—an enduring record, carven in perennial bronze, that\r\nthe King’s Majesty had come to the inheritance of his ancestors. He\r\nbelieved in his Divine Right, the right implied in his existence, his\r\nexistence by the Sanction of Him by Whom kings do reign; and he simply\r\naffirmed his Right, waiting for his people to recognize him as their\r\nlawful sovereign, to do their part as he had done his. Could anything be\r\nmore superbly, more contemptuously kingly than this distinction of the\r\nparts of sovereign and subject? Cardinal King Henry IX was happy in his\r\nlot, for he had a goodly heritage,—in the Holy Roman Church. Had His\r\nMajesty desired, the Supreme Pontiff could have released him from his\r\necclesiastical estate and obligations by a stroke of the pontifical pen,\r\nto enable him to prosecute his indubitable right. But he did not so\r\ndesire. He had chosen the better part—peace—and the happiness of the\r\nsubjects who were his, but who never would own him as their liege lord\r\nand sovereign. No more splendid and disinterested example of\r\nself-sacrifice exists in human history than the spectacle of this King\r\nof England who scorned to seek to compel unwilling homage. It was indeed\r\nthe act of a king.\r\n\r\nAfter the technical assumption of sovereignty, His Majesty made no\r\nfurther claim.[124] He did not hesitate to use his regal style on\r\nmonuments which he erected in his Sub-Urban Diocese, or in similar\r\nplaces: but he was content to be called the Cardinal-Duke of York, as\r\nbefore, though all the world knew him as he really was, and invariably\r\naccorded the respect due to him as a prince of the church. There was,\r\nhowever, one notorious exception. The chivalrous nation of France, which\r\nformerly had revenged itself on the Lord Alexander P.P. VI by attacking\r\nMadonna Giovanna de’ Catanei and Madonna Giulia Orsini nata Farnese, was\r\njust as ready now to strike at the old and helpless; and it is to the\r\nshameful atrocities of France that England owes the noble action of a\r\nBorgia in regard to the last of the Royal House of Stewart.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Cardinal Stefano Borgia was at Padua in the autumn\r\nof 1799 while the regicidal armies of the French Consulate were earning\r\ninfamy by ravaging the pontifical states. From Padua His Eminence\r\nindited a private letter, dated the fourteenth of September 1799,\r\naddressed to an English baronet, one Sir John Coxe Hippisley, at\r\nGrosvenor Street, London, which will tell a tale. The Cardinal wrote as\r\nfollows, in beautiful Italian with the incorrect spelling of a gentleman\r\nborn:\r\n\r\n  “The friendship with which you honoured me in Rome encourages me to\r\n  lay before you a case worthy of your most mature reflection: which is,\r\n  that, among the other cardinals who have taken refuge in Padua, here\r\n  is also the Cardinal-Duke; and it is greatly afflicting to me to see\r\n  so great a Personage, the last descendant of his Royal House, reduced\r\n  to such distressed circumstances, having been barbarously stripped by\r\n  the French of all his property” (_dai Francesi barbaramente spogliato\r\n  di tutto_;) “and, if they deprived him not of life also, it was\r\n  through the mercy of the Almighty, Who protected him in his flight\r\n  both by sea and land, the miseries of which, nevertheless, greatly\r\n  injured his health, at the advanced age of seventy-five; and produced\r\n  a very grievous sore in one of his legs.\r\n\r\n  “Those who are well-informed of this most worthy Cardinal’s affairs,\r\n  have assured me that, since his flight, having left behind him his\r\n  rich and magnificent valuables, which were all sacked and plundered\r\n  both at Rome and Frascati, he has been supported by the silver plate\r\n  which he had taken with him, and of which he began to dispose at\r\n  Messina; and, I understand, that in order to supply his wants during a\r\n  few months in Venice, he has sold all that remained.\r\n\r\n  “Of the jewels[125] that he possessed, very few remain, as the most\r\n  valuable had been sacrificed in the well-known contributions (_forced\r\n  levies_ would be a juster word than the gentle Cardinal’s meek\r\n  _contributions_) “to the French our destructive plunderers; and, with\r\n  respect to his income, having suffered the loss of forty-eight\r\n  thousand Roman crowns annually by the French Revolution, the remainder\r\n  was lost also by the fall of Rome; namely, the yearly sum of ten\r\n  thousand crowns assigned to him by the Apostolic Chamber, and also his\r\n  particular funds in the Roman Bank.\r\n\r\n  “The only income which he has left is that of his benefices in\r\n  Spain,[126] which amount to fourteen thousand crowns: but this, as it\r\n  is only payable in paper at present, is greatly reduced by the\r\n  disadvantage of exchange; and even that has remained unpaid for more\r\n  than a year, owing, perhaps, to the interrupted communication with\r\n  that kingdom.\r\n\r\n  “But here it is necessary that I should add that the Cardinal is\r\n  heavily burdened with the annual sum of four thousand crowns for the\r\n  dowry of the Countess of Albany his sister-in-law; three thousand\r\n  crowns for the mother[127] of his deceased niece; and fifteen hundred\r\n  for divers annuities of his father and brother: nor has he credit to\r\n  supply the means of acquitting these obligations.\r\n\r\n  “This picture, nevertheless, which I present to your friendship, may\r\n  well excite the compassion of every one who will reflect upon the high\r\n  birth, the elevated dignity, and the advanced age of the Personage\r\n  whose situation I now sketch in the plain language of truth, without\r\n  resorting to the aid of eloquence. I will only entreat you to\r\n  communicate it to those distinguished persons who have influence with\r\n  your government; persuaded as I am that English Magnanimity[128] (_la\r\n  Magnanimitá Inglese_) will not suffer an Illustrious Personage of the\r\n  same nation to perish in misery.\r\n\r\n  “But here I pause, not wishing to offend your national delicacy, which\r\n  delights to act from its own generous disposition, rather than from\r\n  the impulse and urgency of others.[129]\r\n\r\n  “We have here (Padua) not only the Cardinal-Duke, but other cardinals,\r\n  namely, the two Doria, Caprara, and Livizzani; and perhaps very soon\r\n  they will all be here, as it is probable that the Conclave will be\r\n  held in this place; for it has pleased God to deliver from all His\r\n  labours the so eminently unfortunate Lord Pius P.P. VI, Who cherished\r\n  for you the most tender affection, and Who was pleased when He was in\r\n  the Carthusian convent (_Certosa_) at Florence to invest me with the\r\n  charge of the Proprefecture of the Congregation of the Propagation of\r\n  the Faith.\r\n\r\n  “My paper fails me, but I shall never fail of being\r\n\r\n                 “Your true friend and servitor (_servitore_)\r\n                                             “STEFANO, CARDINAL BORGIA.”\r\n\r\nThat letter was written in September 1799. It is not clear by what route\r\nCardinal Borgia’s courier carried it to England, nor how long was\r\noccupied by the journey. It manifestly is probable that the frightful\r\ndisorders in France closed the short road through that country; and the\r\nshort road in time of peace was not traversed in less than three weeks.\r\nAn English lady[130] who married Don Lorenzo Sforza-Cesarini Duca di\r\nSegni, etc., (they were the grand-parents of the present Duke Lorenzo,)\r\nmade the journey with post-horses in the autumn of 1837; and described\r\nit in detail to the present writer a few years ago, incidentally\r\nmentioning that, between London and Rome, it was necessary to pass in\r\nand out of the Pontifical States no less than five times, with the usual\r\ncustom-house inconveniences. What then would the journey have been in\r\n1799, when France, internally distracted, was inimical to all and\r\nsundry, especially to England and England’s friends! Further the journey\r\nfrom Vienna to Venice occupied a fortnight, as may be seen from the\r\ndates of succeeding letters on a later page. These considerations are\r\nnecessary to explain the fact that three months elapsed before Cardinal\r\nBorgia was able to acknowledge Sir John Coxe Hippisley’s reply; for,\r\nduring those three months, the journey—the long journey—had to be made\r\ntwice over by the courier, going and returning; which would leave little\r\ntime for action between.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to think that these events occurred only a hundred years\r\nago; and that this intimate view of the private and secret history of\r\nthe last royal Stewart, and the last illustrious Borgia, should have\r\nbeen suffered to remain obscure. Had there been any disgraceful element\r\nin the transaction, concealment could be understood: but contrariwise,\r\nthe very greatest credit is reflected upon all concerned, on Borgia, on\r\nStewart, on Englishmen, and—to give the devil his due—on the Elector of\r\nHanover, vulgarly called George III. The indiscretions, the human\r\nweaknesses of the earlier Borgia are the things by which they are\r\nremembered:\r\n\r\n              “The evil, that men do, lives after them;\r\n              The good is oft interred with their bones.”\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a good deed of a Borgia, which incontinently shall be\r\ntranslated from its inadequate sepulchre, ostended for the veneration of\r\nthe faithful, and enshrined anew more worthily. Upon receiving Cardinal\r\nBorgia’s enchanting letter, Sir John Coxe Hippisley sent to his Eminence\r\na draft for £500, begging him to offer this to the August Personage,\r\n“for the exigencies of the moment”; and promising to air the matter in a\r\nproper quarter.\r\n\r\nThe meticulous precautions which invariably are taken to secure the\r\nfreedom of the Conclave for the election of a Pope, already have been\r\ndescribed here. On the death of the Lord Pius P.P. VI alluded to in\r\nCardinal Borgia’s letter, when Rome was in the hands of the French and\r\nall Italy distracted by foreign occupation, the Sacred College made its\r\nway by slow degrees and amid infinite peril to Venice, where it\r\nassembled in the convent on the Island of San Giorgio, and enclosed\r\nitself in Conclave with all formality. This means, among other things,\r\nthat no cardinals were allowed to receive or to send out letters, unless\r\nthese were subjected to a rigorous examination by the Cardinal-Censors;\r\nthe object of which is to prevent the voting from being influenced by\r\nsecular and external Powers or considerations.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth of January 1800, the said Cardinal-Censors on the Island\r\nof San Giorgio permitted the egress of a letter from Cardinal Borgia to\r\nSir John Coxe Hippisley, acknowledging the receipt of the £500, speaking\r\nof the gratitude and satisfaction of the August Personage at knowing\r\nwhat was being done on his behalf. “I find myself shut up here in\r\nConclave for the election of a new pontiff, (says Cardinal Borgia,) with\r\nthirty-four cardinals, who, when they heard of the English generosity to\r\ntheir Illustrious Colleague,”[131]—and he describes the many kindly\r\ncomplimentary and genuinely admiring sentiments which these Italian\r\nCardinals, in common with Italians of all epochs and of all ranks,\r\n(excepting cardinals of the Nineteenth Century)[132] always felt and\r\nfeel for England and the English. The letter is subscribed in the\r\npolitely respectful third person,\r\n\r\n               “Suo servitore cordialissinio ed Amico\r\n                                       “S. CARD. BORGIA.”\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-sixth of February 1800 a second letter was allowed to pass\r\nout of the Conclave from Cardinal Borgia to Sir John; a short note, in\r\nfact, which said that an English gentleman[133] had just been permitted\r\nto enter the Conclave, being the bearer of “a very polite letter from\r\nLord Minto” to the August Personage. This “very polite letter” is given\r\nin its original form, as well for its own sake, as for an example of the\r\nFrench of English diplomacy a hundred years ago. It is addressed to the\r\nCardinal-Duke of York.\r\n\r\n                                              “DE VIENNA, _9 Feb. 1800_.\r\n\r\n  “MONSEIGNEUR,\r\n\r\n  J’ai reçu les Ordres de Sa Majesté le Roi de la Grande Bretagne de\r\n  faire remettre à Votre Eminence la somme de deux mille livres\r\n  Sterling, et d’assurer V.E. qu’en acceptant cette marque de l’interêt\r\n  et de l’estime de S.M. elle lui fera un sensible plaisir. Il “m’est en\r\n  même terns ordonné de faire part à V.E. des intentions de SM. de lui\r\n  transmettre une pareille somme de £2000 Sterling au mois de Juillet si\r\n  les circonstances demeuraient telles que V.E. continuât à la desirer.\r\n\r\n  “J’ai donc l’honneure de la prevenir que la somme de £2000 Stg. est\r\n  déposée à la maison de Messieurs Coutts et Cie., Banquiers à Londres à\r\n  la disposition de Votre Eminence.

Plen. de S.M.B.\r\n                                             “à la Cour de Vienne._”\r\n\r\nStripped of polite verbiage this letter conveyed to Cardinal King Henry\r\nIX the offer of an annuity of £4000 for so long as he might please to\r\nneed it. It is ungracious to say with some Scots that, after all, the\r\nElector of Hanover only offered to the Majesty of England a calf of his\r\nown cow. The situation was fraught with difficulty. The essentials and\r\nthe accidentals of his birth combined to make Cardinal Henry Benedict\r\nStewart the only rightful King of England. He could not help that; any\r\nmore than any man can help being the son of his father and mother, born\r\nin lawful wedlock; and King-ship, being of Divine origin, can only be\r\nconferred or transferred or confirmed by the Divinity acting through His\r\nEarthly Vicegerent, the Roman Pontiff. With these principles to guide\r\nhim, and the circumstances being as they were, Cardinal Henry grandly\r\ndecided to be king only in name. His mere existence, however, made the\r\ntenure of the occupant of the English Throne to some extent uncertain:\r\nfor an alien dynasty can never feel entirely comfortable while any of\r\nthe dispossessed remain. The old order had changed, and had given place\r\nto new: but the New could not know that the Old would accept—would\r\ncondescend to accept—help in its private necessity. It was a most\r\ndelicate position. On the other hand, it was out of the question that\r\nthe King’s Majesty should make known to Englishmen his desperate plight,\r\nfor Cardinal Henry was every inch a King. But the good heart and clever\r\npen of Cardinal Stefano Borgia solved that difficulty, by invoking on\r\ngrounds of private friendship the intervention of Sir John Coxe\r\nHippisley.\r\n\r\nThe method of relief, when relief was seen to be required, was a task\r\nfor the wits of diplomacy. When the English choose to change their\r\nsovereign dynasties, they at least should secure their nation against\r\nthe disgrace of seeing, perishing in indigence, one who truly could say\r\n_My grandfather formerly wore the Crown, touched for the king’s evil on\r\nthe steps of St. Winifred’s Well, and reigned as King in England_. The\r\nspectacle of the blind beggar of Constantinople, crying “Date obolum\r\nBelisario” is shameful enough for one continent, and can be spared the\r\ndisgrace of repetition. A pension on the Civil List would have met the\r\nneeds of the case: but it would have had many disadvantages. It would\r\nnecessitate publicity; it would have been most disagreeable to the\r\ngentle pride of the August Personage whose life and character commanded\r\nnothing but respect.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, one is accustomed to hear members of a certain class\r\nof Scot, desirous of shining at least in a reflected light, boasting\r\nthat their forbears were “out in the ’15” or “out in the ’45.” One does\r\nnot so often hear an Englishman congratulating himself on his descent\r\nfrom heroes who endured confiscation, attainder, in the self-same\r\ncause—but in 1688. The English resist aggression at the outset; they are\r\nused to, are glad to, make sacrifices for, not bargains of, their\r\nsovereigns; and, needing no reflected light, they are not good boasters.\r\nThere is no doubt that a great deal of Scots flesh was given in 1715 and\r\nin 1745 for the House of Stewart. There is no doubt that some Scots gold\r\nwas offered on the same account. But one has not heard that the loyal\r\nScots—loyal, as they say, to the Stewarts,—ever attempted to minister to\r\nthe necessities of their liege Lord, the Cardinal King Henry the Ninth.\r\nEthics, derived from Master John Knox, whose iconoclastic ardour stopped\r\nat the “saxpence” and made it the idolatrous object of supreme worship\r\nof dulia and hyperdulia and latria, no doubt mitigated the sentiment of\r\nloyalty in regard to a king who happened to be a prelatical papist. A\r\nnational fund, a fund raised by the adherents of the Stewarts, to\r\nprovide a yearly income for their exiled sovereign, would have been\r\ngraceful and acceptable. It is the duty of a people to maintain its\r\nmonarch; and it is not beneath the dignity of monarchy to accept such\r\nmaintenance offered in loyalty. Peter’s Pence is nothing but a fund of\r\nyearly offerings instituted by King Ælfred the Great of England for the\r\nmaintenance of the Sovereign Pontiff. In the case of Cardinal King Henry\r\nthe Ninth, however, no such guaranteed annuity was forthcoming from the\r\nnation of which no inconsiderable part admitted his right to rule.\r\nLoyalty to the Stewarts—practical living loyalty—was confined to\r\nindividuals, few in number; and it became necessary to seek another\r\nmethod of solving the difficulty.\r\n\r\nPrivate munificence, towards the King _de jure_, on the part of—let it\r\nbe said, for Cardinal Henry himself said it, and none had more right to\r\ndecide than he—on the part of the King _de facto_, King George the\r\nThird, the official representative of the English nation, was the only\r\npossible method, which was likely to be agreeable or acceptable.\r\nTherefore, an annuity of £4000 was offered, not from the Civil List, not\r\nfrom the Nation, but from the Privy Purse, from King George to Cardinal\r\nHenry—from one English Gentleman to another. The delicate tact and\r\nstraightforwardness with which the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary of His Britannic Majesty at the Court of Vienna made the\r\noffer; the complimentary terms of his letter to the “August Personage;”\r\nhis guarded denunciation of the French robbers of the Cardinal as “the\r\nUniversal Plague of our time which seems to design the destruction of\r\nall that is most worthy of Veneration and Respect;” his proffered\r\nhomage;—all these qualities egregiously deserved Cardinal Stefano\r\nBorgia’s epithet “very polite,” and made the proposal one which\r\nhonourably and gratefully could be accepted. At least the Cardinal-Duke\r\nof York was pleased to think so, as the two letters following here will\r\nshew. It may be observed that they are written in incoherent and\r\npeculiar English. Let it be remembered that they were written by a very\r\nold gentleman, under circumstance of extreme agitation; in a language of\r\nappalling difficulty which, though his native tongue, was altogether\r\nstrange to him; for he had not lived in England, and, in his life-long\r\nexile, he used nothing but Latin with his clergy or Italian with his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nHe wrote from the Conclave on the Island of San Giorgio on the\r\ntwenty-sixth of February 1800; and the letters are sealed with the Royal\r\nArms of England and France surmounted with the Cardinalitial Hat instead\r\nof the Crown.\r\n\r\n(I. To Lord Minto.)\r\n\r\n  “With the arrival of Mr. Oakley who has been this morning with Me, I\r\n  have received by his discourse, and much more by your letters, so many\r\n  Tokens of your regard, singular consideration, and attention for My\r\n  Person, that oblige Me to abandon all sort of ceremony, and to begin\r\n  abruptly to assure you My dear lord, that your letters have been most\r\n  acceptable to Me in all shapes and regards. I did not in the least\r\n  doubt of the noble way of thinking of your generous and beneficent\r\n  Sovereign; but I did not expect to see in writing so many and so\r\n  obliging expressions that well calculated by the Persons who receive\r\n  them and understand their force, impressed in their minds a lively\r\n  sense of tenderness and gratitude which, I own to you, obliges me more\r\n  than the generosity spontaneously imparted.\r\n\r\n  “I am in reality at a loss to express in writing all the sentiments of\r\n  My Heart, and for that reason leave it entirely to the interest you\r\n  take in all that regards My Person to make known in an energetical and\r\n  convenient manner all I fain would say to express My thankfulness\r\n  which may easily be by you comprehended after having perused the\r\n  contents of this letter.\r\n\r\n  “I am much obliged to you to have indicated to Me the way I may write\r\n  unto Coutts the Court Banker, and shall follow your friendly\r\n  insinuations. In the meantime I am very desirous that you should be\r\n  convinced of My sentiments of sincere esteem and friendship with which\r\n  My dear lord with all My heart I embrace you.\r\n\r\n                                                       “HENRY CARDINAL.”\r\n\r\n(II. To Sir John Coxe Hippisley.)\r\n\r\n  “Your letters fully convince me of the cordial interest you take in\r\n  all that regards My Person, and am happy to acknowledge that\r\n  principally I owe to your friendly efforts, and to them of your\r\n  friends, the succour generously granted to relieve the extreme\r\n  necessities into which I have been driven by the present dismal\r\n  circumstances. I cannot sufficiently express how sensible I am to your\r\n  good heart: and write these few lines in the first place to contest to\r\n  you these My most sincere and grateful sentiments and then to inform\r\n  you by means of Mr. Oakley an English Gent^n arrived here last week, I\r\n  have received a letter from Lord Minto from Vienna, advising Me that\r\n  he had orders from his Court to remit to Me the sum of £2000 Sterling,\r\n  and that in the month of July I may again draw, if I desire it, for\r\n  another equal sum. The letter is written in so extremely obliging and\r\n  genteel a manner, and with expressions of singular regard and\r\n  consideration for Me, that, I assure you, excited in Me most\r\n  particular and lively sentiments, not only of satisfaction for the\r\n  delicacy with which the affair has been managed, but also of gratitude\r\n  for the generosity with which has been provided for my necessity.\r\n\r\n  I have answered Lord Minto’s letter, and gave it saturday last to Mr.\r\n  Oakley who was to send it by that evening’s post” (the ambassadorial\r\n  courier) “to Vienna, and have written in a manner that I hope will be\r\n  to his lordship’s satisfaction. I own to you that the succour granted\r\n  to Me could not be more timely, for, without it, it would have been\r\n  impossible for Me to subsist on account of the absolutely irreparable\r\n  loss of all My income, the very funds being also destroyed; so that I\r\n  would otherwise have been reduced during the short remainder of My\r\n  life to languish in misery and indigence. I would not loose a moment’s\r\n  time to apprize you of all this, and am very certain that your\r\n  experimented good heart will find proper means to make known in an\r\n  energical and proper manner, these sentiments of My grateful\r\n  acknowledgment.\r\n\r\n                                   “Your best of friends,\r\n                                                       “HENRY CARDINAL.”\r\n\r\nOf the remaining history of H.R.H. The Cardinal-Duke of York it is not\r\nnecessary to speak here. He died in 1807, and was honourably buried in\r\nthe Vatican Basilica with his father and his brother, in a tomb which\r\nbears their names and styles, James III, Charles III, Henry IX, last of\r\nthe Royal House of Stewart, three kings “who paid three crowns for a\r\nmass,” who sacrificed the crowns of Great Britain, France, and Ireland,\r\nrather than their religious convictions. May they rest in peace.[134]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe action of Cardinal Stefano Borgia which just has been described, was\r\nnot the only evidence of nobility of soul that he exhibited during the\r\nlong Conclave of 1799–1800. He did, or rather he did not do, another\r\ndeed; the neglect of which suffices to win him high renown.\r\n\r\nIt already has been manifested here, that the tide of human ambition\r\nruns at its highest in the Conclave for the election of a Pope. At\r\ndifferent periods of history, the papacy has been regarded as an\r\nappanage of the empire, or of the great Italian baronies, Crescenzi,\r\nColonna, Orsini, Savelli, Medici. The House of Borgia, not without\r\nreason of a kind, desired to rank with these; and cardinals of that\r\nHouse complacently expected election. There already had been two Borgia\r\nPopes, the strenuous Lord Calixtus P.P. III. and the invincible Lord\r\nAlexander P.P. VI. The great-grandson of St. Francisco de Borja,\r\nCardinal Don Gaspero, publicly hoped to be the third, and was\r\ndisappointed. Now, in the last year of the Eighteenth Century, was\r\nenclosed in another Conclave another Borgia Cardinal, the noble Cardinal\r\nStefano, and it confidently was expected that he would emerge therefrom\r\nnot Stefano, but Peter, crowned with the Triregno, the pontifical diadem\r\nmade of feathers of white peacocks encircled with three crowns of gold.\r\n\r\nHumanly speaking his chance of election was not chance but certainty. He\r\nwas admitted on all hands to be _facile Princeps_ of the Sacred College.\r\nHis learning, his dominant power, his simple piety, his universally\r\nsympathetic personality, assured him of an unanimous majority, had he\r\nchosen to enter the ranks of the cardinals-competitors, that is to say,\r\nof the cardinals who were eligible and also willing.\r\n\r\nWhen a man is aware of his own ability to do certain legitimate and\r\nbeneficent deeds, the world is wont to call him fool as well as knave\r\nwhen he neglects to seek the situation, the opportunity, for exercising\r\nhis peculiar talent. In this matter, the world is not ill-advised. Then,\r\nif an ecclesiastic is convinced that, in a certain position of\r\nauthority, he can do God-service, why should he be deterred from seeking\r\nthat position by craven terror of the inevitable scowls, rhodomontades,\r\nand lampoons of envious incompetent venal mediocrity? The Lord Pius P.P.\r\nII was not afraid. He knew His own powers. He was convinced of the\r\npurity of His intentions; and, as Cardinal Enea Silvio Bartolomeo de’\r\nPiccolhuomini, he met the schemes of Cardinal Guillaume d’Estoutville in\r\nthe Conclave of 1458 with counter-schemes, and accomplished His Own\r\nelevation to the pontifical throne. There is another and more intimate\r\nexample, nearer home, and no later than the last century: the example of\r\na provost of a metropolitan cathedral chapter, who knew his power, who\r\nknew the lawfully designated successor of the archbishop to be unfitted\r\nfor the responsibilities of office, who kept an agent at the Vatican to\r\nurge his candidature when the see was vacant, until the Lord Pius P.P.\r\nIX, declaring it to be _un colpo-di-stato di Domeniddio_, transformed\r\nthe convert-provost into Westminster’s Archbishop. It cannot be alleged\r\nthat Cardinal Henry Edward Manning became inglorious by giving practical\r\nevidence of his contempt for the ridiculous and wicked doctrine which is\r\npreached by vicious degenerates, that _the Almighty intends much of His\r\nGood Work to be wasted_. It cannot be alleged that Cardinal Manning was\r\nactuated by personal arrogance, or by desire for personal\r\naggrandisement. His whole life of saint-like self-sacrifice, of\r\nintensest humility, of ascetic mortification, of ceaseless toil for the\r\nspiritual and temporal welfare of all men without distinction of creed,\r\nhas proved the contrary. By the same token, on this score, there would\r\nhave been no stain on the noble character of Cardinal Stefano Borgia had\r\nhe desired to exert himself to compass his own election to the Throne of\r\nPeter.\r\n\r\nBut he did not so desire. Indeed, he shewed himself unwilling to be\r\nelected; and the Sacred College made choice of the next Most Eminent\r\nLord, the Benedictine Cardinal Gregorio Luigi Barnabo Chiaramonte, whose\r\naccession was proclaimed under the name of the Lord Pius P.P. VII. So\r\nChristendom still lacks the third Borgia Pontiff,—a lack unlikely soon\r\nto be made good; seeing that, since Cardinal Stefano, no Borgia wears\r\nthe scarlet hat; yet by no means irremediable, seeing that the House of\r\nBorgia is living, and not dead.\r\n\r\nLittle remains to be written of the last pre-eminent Borgia. On the\r\ndeath of Cardinal Gerdil, Cardinal Stefano was promoted from the\r\nProprefecture to the Prefecture of Propaganda Fide.\r\n\r\nIn 1804, while attending the debile Lord Pius P.P. VII to Paris,\r\n(whither His Holiness had been summoned for the coronation as emperor of\r\nthe Corsican upstart Consul Napoleon Buonaparte,) Cardinal Stefano\r\nBorgia died, at the age of seventy-three years, on the Festival of St.\r\nClement the twenty-third of November, at Lyons, and was buried there in\r\nthe cathedral. It is worth noting that he had been baptized in the\r\ncathedral of St. Clement at Velletri in December 1731; that he derived\r\nhis cardinalitial Title from the church of St. Clement in Rome; and that\r\non the Festival of St. Clement 1804, he died. His friend, Fra Pietro\r\nPaolino da San Bartolomeo, a sandalled Carmelite, wrote his biography.\r\nThe celebrated Cancellieri composed his elegy, which has been\r\nrepublished by Bodoni. The Borgia Museum of Antiquities which he\r\nestablished in Velletri, and whose elaborate catalogue is the work of\r\nhis uncle Don Filippaurelio Visconti, in chief part is in the Royal\r\nMuseum of Naples; the College of Propaganda has the lesser part, and\r\nalso his splendid library.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe House of Borgia continues to flourish in the descendants of Cardinal\r\nStefano’s brother, the CAVALIERE GIAMPAOLO BORGIA OF VELLETRI, a general\r\nin the pontifical army; who married the representative of two of the\r\nmost important houses of the Romagna, often mentioned in these pages as\r\nhaving been subdued by the splendid Duke Cesare (detto Borgia) di\r\nValentinois della Romagna, in the campaigns of 1499 and 1501–2,—the\r\nCountess Alcmena[135] Baglioni-Malatesta of Perugia. Eighteen children\r\nwere the issue of this marriage. The names of five have been recovered\r\nat the date of writing, viz., the eldest, Cavaliere Camillo; Don\r\nClemente; Don Alessandro; Don Cesare; and the youngest Don Francesco.\r\n\r\n  (α) THE CAVALIERE CAMILLO BORGIA, born 1777, was Adjutant-General\r\n        and Field-Marshal under King Joachim Murat of Naples;\r\n        Aulic-Counsellor and Chargé d’affaires of the King of Denmark\r\n        in Rome; Knight of the Legion of Honour,[136] and of the Order\r\n        of the Two Sicilies.[137] Distinguished in arms by his\r\n        military talent, he was not less renowned in the kingdom of\r\n        Letters. After his retirement from the army, he travelled much\r\n        in Northern Africa to study Latin antiquities. At least one of\r\n        his works has achieved fame—the _Planisfero Borgiano_. He\r\n        married Mdlle. Adelaide Quaison, (who died in 1865); and he\r\n        died in 1817, leaving issue\r\n\r\n      DON ETTORE BORGIA, born at Velletri in 1802, a Roman Patrician,\r\n        Knight of Honour and Devotion of the Order of St. John of\r\n        Jerusalem of Malta, Knight-Commander of the Order of St.\r\n        Gregory the Great,[138] Gonfalonier of Velletri, National\r\n        Representative of Velletri in the Roman Parliament of 1848,\r\n        and Provisional Governour of Velletri in 1871. He departed\r\n        this life, in 1892, at Melazzo in Sicily, being of the age of\r\n        ninety years; and his death without issue extinguished the\r\n        Veliternian Branch of the House of Borgia.\r\n\r\n  (β) DON CLEMENTE BORGIA OF ROME, who married Donna Luisa Calderoni,\r\n        and died in 1852, leaving issue,\r\n\r\n  (α) Don Adriano, who died unmarried:\r\n\r\n  (β) Don Tito, who died unmarried:\r\n\r\n  (γ) Don Costantino, a prelate, (author of _De Cathedra Romana Sancti\r\n        Petri Principus Apostolorum Oratio_, etc. a quarto published at\r\n        Rome in 1845;) died unmarried in 1878:\r\n\r\n  (δ) DON AUGUSTO, a prelate, born 1820. His death, on the second of\r\n        September 1900, without issue, extinguished the Roman Branch of\r\n        the House of Borgia.\r\n\r\n  (γ) DON ALESSANDRO BORGIA, born 1788, Balì of the Order of St. John of\r\n        Jerusalem of Malta, died 1872.\r\n\r\n  (δ) DON CESARE BORGIA, was a Knight-Commander of the Order of St. John\r\n        of Jerusalem of Malta; and followed the profession of a man of\r\n        letters in Ferrara, (the city of which his kinswoman, Madonna\r\n        Lucrezia, formerly had been the sovereign duchess,) until his\r\n        death in 1861.\r\n\r\n_(Here should be inserted the names of thirteen children of the\r\nCavaliere Giampaolo Borgia and his wife the Countess Alcmena\r\nBaglioni-Malatesta of Perugia, which, at present are not accessible.

The sacred offices\r\nof mother and wife, of comforter and helper, chiefly occupied them. Yet\r\nno stupid restrictions were invented to harass and embitter the\r\nexceptions to this rule, the freaks, the Sports of Nature, (in modern\r\nmedical phraseology;) and thus the splenetic self-assertive\r\nabnormalities of the twentieth century were avoided. Women, who so\r\nwilled, were absolutely free; they were admitted to the same\r\nintellectual training as men in the universities and colleges[140];\r\nprofessorial chairs rewarded talent male or female; and a learned lady\r\nwas called Virago, in no sarcastic vein but in flattering admiration,\r\nthe word being used in its scriptural sense. (_Vulgate_, Gen. ii. 23.)\r\n\r\nOf these the most famous were Madonna Vittoria Colonna and Madonna\r\nVeronica Gambara. The first was the daughter of Don Fabrizio Colonna,\r\nGrand Constable of Naples, (who already has been mentioned as helping\r\nthe Duchess Lucrezia Borgia’s consort to evade the snare of the Lord\r\nJulius P.P. II,) by his wife Madonna Agnesina di Montefeltro, daughter\r\nof Duke Federigo of Urbino. She was born in 1490; and married at\r\nnineteen in 1509 to Don Ferrando Francisco d’Avalos, who died in 1525.\r\nShe consecrated the remaining twenty-two years of her life to her\r\nhusband’s memory and to the duties of religion, residing, for the sake\r\nof her reputation, as a parlour-boarder in religious houses at Orvieto,\r\nViterbo, Ischia, and Rome, where she kept a literary salon. Many\r\ncelebrated men were her frequent visitors, among whom may be mentioned\r\nCardinals Reginald Pole and Giacopo Sadoleto; the poets Marcantonio\r\nFlaminio and Pietro Carnesecchi; and Fra Bernardino Ochino the second\r\ngeneral of the new religion called _Cappuccini_, who, after apostatizing\r\nto write his Twenty-one Dialogues advocating Polygamy as authorized by\r\nthe example of the Patriarchs, was in turn expelled by the heresiarchs\r\nof Geneva. But by far the greatest of Madonna Vittoria Colonna’s\r\nadmirers was the sculptor-painter-poet Messer Michelangelo Buonarroti,\r\nwho respectfully inscribed to her many beautiful sonnets—sonnets which\r\nhe hewed out of language, as also he hewed statues out of marble, and\r\nwith the same aloof and rugged majesty. The following is given as a\r\nspecimen, not only of the style of Messer Michelangelo Buonarroti, but\r\nalso for the profession of faith contained in the latter half of the\r\nsestett—a human document which lends marvellous light to the more secret\r\nsoul of this true artist and gigantic misanthrope.\r\n\r\n “Per ritornar là donde venne fora   “As one who will reseek her home of\r\n                                       light,\r\n “L’immortal forma al tuo carcer     “Thy form immortal to this\r\n   terreno                             prison-house\r\n “Venne com’angel di pietà si pieno  “Descended, like an angel piteous,\r\n “Che sana ogn’intelleto, e’l mondo  “To heal all hearts and make the\r\n   onora.                              whole world bright.\r\n “Questo sol m’arde, e questo        “’Tis this that thralls my soul in\r\n   m’innamora;                         love’s delight,\r\n “Non pur di fora il tuo volto       “Not thy clear face of beauty\r\n   sereno:                             glorious;\r\n “Ch’amor non già di cosa che vien   “For he who harbours virtue still\r\n   meno                                will choose\r\n “Tien ferma speme, in cu’ virtù     “To love what neither years nor\r\n   dimora.                             death can blight.\r\n “Ne altro avvien di cose altere e   “So fares it ever with things high\r\n   nuove                               and rare\r\n “In cui si preme la natura; e’l     “Wrought in the sweat of nature;\r\n   cielo                               heaven above\r\n “E ch’a lor parto largo             “Showers on their birth the\r\n   s’apparecchia.                      blessings of her prime:\r\n “Ne Dio, suo grazia, mi se mostra   “Nor hath God deigned to shew\r\n   altrove,                            Himself elsewhere\r\n “Piu che’n alcun leggiadro e mortal “More clearly than inhuman forms\r\n   velo;                               sublime,\r\n “E quel sol amo, perche’n quel si   “Which, since they image Him, alone\r\n   specchia.

It may be mentioned that her descendant\r\nand namesake the beautiful Princess Vittoria Colonna married into the\r\npatrician House of Sforza-Cesarina, so prominent in these pages, and is\r\nthe mother of the present Duke Lorenzo.\r\n\r\nMadonna Veronica Gambara, the friend and fellow-virago of Madonna\r\nVittoria Colonna was the daughter of Count Gianfrancesco Gambara, and\r\nMadonna Alda Pia da Carpi. She was born in 1485, and educated by Messer\r\nPietro Bembo (afterwards Cardinal); married in 1509 to Don Guilberto di\r\nCor Reggio; and widowed nine years later. At her Palazzo Marsili at\r\nBologna, on the occasion of the coronation of Caesar Carlos V in 1530,\r\nshe received in princely state the scholars of the day, “Bembo, Molza,\r\nthe witty Francesco Berni, the learned Vida, the stately Trissio, the\r\nnoble-hearted Marcantonio Flaminio, Paolo Giovio and Francesco\r\nGuicciardini.” She lived till 1550, a good mother to her two sons,\r\nIppolito and Girolamo, noble, learned, virtuous, and a poet and\r\nwoman-of-letters of much distinction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Appendix II\r\n          CREATURE UNPROCLAIMED, OF THE LORD ALEXANDER P.P.

This pose was engendered of the revival of learning\r\nupon human vanity. Scholars were the favourites of princes and of kings;\r\nand they modelled their mental deportment on that plane. The man who\r\ncalled himself Pomponius Laetus (for they Latinized or Hellenized even\r\ntheir names,) was a νόθος of the baronial House of Sanseverini, who\r\nrevivified certain pagan cults and, with Cardinal Platino and others,\r\nsolemnly and habitually practised them in secret Catacombs. Really, he\r\nwas a learned man who owed his learning to his own wits and exertions,\r\nand not to the help or influence of his own kin; who, while he was a\r\npoor unknown pupil of Messer Lorenzo Valla, refused to acknowledge him.\r\nBut, when at last he had won fame and was sought by the best society,\r\nthe Sanseverini, being anxious to have at least the credit of an\r\nintellect, made him an overture of friendship, and offered to take him\r\nto their arms. His rejoinder is worth preservation as a specimen as well\r\nof the effect of megalomania, as of the successful imitation of a\r\nclassic style. With delicious arrogance he wrote,\r\n\r\n        “_Pomponius Laetus cognatis et propinquis suis salutem.\r\n        “Quod petitis fieri non potest.” Valete._\r\n\r\nWriters of the Borgian Era curiously translated contemporary terms and\r\ntitles into their classic phraseological equivalent. The Pope was\r\n_Pontifex Maximus_, and _Princeps_. The Emperor was _Caesar Augustus_,\r\nand sometimes _Princeps_. The Cardinals were _Senators_ or _Augurs_,\r\nelders in charge of the lightning (“aliquis senior qui publica fulgura\r\ncondit.”) Nuns were _Vestal Virgins_. Excommunication was _Dirae_.\r\nCarnival was the _Lupercalia_. The Padre Eterno became, by the pen of\r\nBishop Vida of Alba in Piedmont, _Superum Pater Nimbipotens_ and\r\n_Regnator Olympi_. The Santissimo Salvatore was known as Ἥρως; and the\r\nSanto Spirito as Ζέφυρος. Madonna was Ἥρα, Ἀφροδίτη, and Ἀθήνη παρθένος\r\nupon occasion. The saints were gods, δῖος ἢ δῖα, divus vel diva; St.\r\nChristopher was _Herakles_; St. Sebastian, or St. Michael Archangel, was\r\nΦοῖβος Ἀπόλλων; St. Gabriel Archangel was _Hermes_; St. Raphael\r\nArchangel was _Asklepios_; St. George, St. Maurice, St. Theodore, were\r\n_Perseus_ or _Theseus_ according to the taste of the writer. This pose\r\nwas affected in England as well as in Italy, as may be seen in the\r\nfollowing verse from William Caxton’s _Boke of Curtesye_, A.D. 1477.\r\n\r\n             “Loke also/ upon Dan John Lydgate\r\n               “My maister whylome/ monke at berye\r\n             “Worthy to be renomede/ as poete laureate\r\n               “I praye to gode in bliss his soul be mercy\r\n               “Syngynge _Rex Splendens_ that heuenly kyrye\r\n                 “Among the Muses Nine celestyalle\r\n                 “Before the hyest Iubyter of alle.”\r\n\r\nThe scholarship of the Renascence of learning, however, was not all\r\nempty foolishness, not all the merest pose. The extravagances of the\r\nYellow School of the day were inevitable; and, though their unreality\r\nsoon palls and cloys, they afford ephemeral amusement. But the new\r\nlearning did much to improve taste; and, in the hand of men of goodwill,\r\nwas of vast benefit to the purity of letters. The following verses are\r\nquoted as additional examples of the style of noted scholars of the\r\nBorgian Era.\r\n\r\n\r\n            ANGELI POLITIANI, MONODIA IN LAURENTIUM MEDICEM.\r\n\r\n                     (Intonata per Arrighum Isae.)\r\n\r\n                       Quis dabit capiti meo\r\n                       aquam?

VIII, 1630. Prior to that, they were styled _Most\r\n  Illustrious_ (Illustrissimo); or, in the case of the Cardinal-Dean and\r\n  Cardinal-Nephews, _Most Honourable_ and _Most Worshipful_\r\n  (Osservantissimo, Colendissimo).\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  They claim descent from the Gens Julia. Their armorials show the Bear\r\n  (Orsini) chained to the Column (Colonna) with the Imperial Eagle\r\n  displayed in chief.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  The kingdoms of Aragon, Naples, the two Sicilies, and Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  _Pater Patrum_; the official style of the Roman Pontiff.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  The process of canonisation of King Ælfred, though initiated by a\r\n  Majesty of England (himself a saint _by acclamation_), has not yet\r\n  been completed by the Court of Rome after four hundred and fifty\r\n  years.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Religion—a gathering together for a pious purpose. It was the\r\n  fifteenth century equivalent for Order or Society.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  The Lord Clement P.P. VII (Giulio de Medici), 1523–34, appears on\r\n  Cellini’s lovely medals in a full beard. Probably, in His case, there\r\n  was no choice; for, during the Sack of Rome in 1527 by the Lutheran\r\n  Goths and Catholic Catalans of the Elect-Emperor, Carlos V., His\r\n  Holiness was holding the Mola of Hadrian, or Castle of Santangelo, and\r\n  enduring the hard privations of a siege. Afterwards He did not shave;\r\n  and full beards became the fashion for the clergy. Later, the Lord\r\n  Alexander P.P. VII (Flavio Chigi), made the Vandyke beard and upturned\r\n  mustachio the clerical mode; and, later still, the whole face was\r\n  shaved according to the present rule. But, at the time when the\r\n  Cardinal of Avignon reflected upon the Cardinal of Trebizond’s beard,\r\n  there appears to have been a distinct prejudice in favour of a shaven,\r\n  indeed of a shorn, pope. This may be seen in the medals of popes and\r\n  cardinals of the fifteenth century (when cleanliness was a mark of\r\n  gentility), where the large tonsure and shaven faces are very\r\n  noticeable.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  In the Acta Consistorialia of the Vatican Secret Archives, this Pope\r\n  is called Calixtus the Fourth, evidently by the stupidity of some\r\n  Apostolic Scribe, who happened to know that one John, Abbot of Struma,\r\n  called himself Calixtus III. (having got himself schismatically and\r\n  uncanonically elected in the reign of the Lord Alexander P.P. III);\r\n  and who had not the sense to know that the Holy Roman Church has the\r\n  habit of ignoring pseudopontiffs and other pretenders.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Villanueva (I. 18,181) quotes two Bulls of the Lord Calixtus P.P. III,\r\n  giving relics to the church at Xativa. On p. 51, Villanueva alludes to\r\n  him as “_Don Alonso de Borja, natural de la Torre de Canals, bautizado\r\n  en la Iglesia Collegial de Xativa, hoy S. Felipe, electo en 20 de\r\n  Agosto de 1429 por el Legado de Martin V. Conservo el gobierno de esta\r\n  Iglesia hasta el año en que murió, sienda yu Papa Calixto III. En 1457\r\n  concedió á esta Iglesia un jubileo en el dia de la Asuncion de nuestra\r\n  Señora, imponiendo para la fabrica la contribucion de diez sueldos._”\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  The pontifical diadem, consisting of a conical cap woven of the\r\n  plumage of white peacocks and encircled by three crowns of gold. It is\r\n  sometimes called the Tiara, and must be distinguished from the Mitre.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  The _fiorino d’oro_, _ducato d’oro_, and _scudo d’oro_ were coins\r\n  worth about half a guinea, which, in the fifteenth century, had a\r\n  purchasing value of £2 to £2 10_s._\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  The first printing-press in Italy did not arrive till October 1465 at\r\n  Subjaco in the Sabine Hills.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  The first Pontiff of this name, fifth in succession from the Lord St.\r\n  Peter P.P., is named in the Canon of the Mass as XYSTUS [Ξυστός, _cf._\r\n  Xanthus (Ξάνθος)]. The same form XYSTUS occurs in the Kalendarium,\r\n  and, in fact, in all officially issued liturgies; and is adopted also\r\n  in the authorised English version of the Liturgy. The word SIXTUS does\r\n  not appear to be a Latin word at all, and is not in Andrew’s\r\n  Latin-English Lexicon. It most likely is a debased corruption from\r\n  XYSTUS, when Latin liquefied into the Italian SISTO.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  The business of these Orators (ambassadors) was conducted more by\r\n  means of florid eloquence than by the writing of despatches; though,\r\n  of course, the last was not neglected.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  “... horribilesque ultimosque Britannos.” C. Valerius Catullus XI.\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  _Huszar_, derived by a roundabout route from Italian _cossaro_,\r\n  corsair, freelance (v. Murray).\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  Pragmatic Sanction, term of Byzantine origin, was applied to Imperial\r\n  Edicts (Τὸ Πραγματικόν) containing decrees issued as Fundamental Laws.\r\n  The Decrees of the Council of Basilea were embodied in a Pragmatic\r\n  Sanction by the Diet of Mainz, 1434; but at the Council of Vienna 1448\r\n  most of the advantages which it intended to secure for the Church in\r\n  Germany were abandoned.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  Sikelian—Greek—Latin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  Note his epitaph in the Church of Santa Maria _sopra_ Minerva,\r\n  recorded by Ciacconi.\r\n\r\n               “Cardineo Divus Honore Decoravit Calixtus.”\r\n\r\n  Obviously the fifteenth century used “Divus” as Tacitus also used it\r\n  of Julius and Augustus; and as the twentieth century would say “the\r\n  late ——.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  The Lord Pius P.P. II (Enea Silvio).\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  The saving virtue of a drink of human blood was no new idea. Compare\r\n  Tertullian Apol. IX. “_Item illi qui munere in arena noxiorum\r\n  iugulatorum sanguinem recentem (de iugulo decurrentem exceptum) avida\r\n  siti comitiali morbo medentes hauserunt, ubi sunt?_”\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  Only one piece of antique silver, a salt-cellar, was possessed by the\r\n  House of Sforza in the latter years of the last century. All the rest\r\n  was not recovered from that Don Marino Torlonia, who usurped the\r\n  Sforza-Cesarini titles and estates from 1832 to 1836, when he was\r\n  deprived of them by the Ruota, the Supreme Tribunal of the Holy See,\r\n  in favour of Don Lorenzo Sforza-Cesarini, grandfather of the present\r\n  duke. The line of the great Francesco Sforza-Visconti, Duke of Milan,\r\n  to which Cardinal Ascanio Maria belonged, is now extinct. The present\r\n  House of Sforza-Cesarini descends from Don Bosio Sforza, Count of\r\n  Santafiora, 1441–1476, brother of the great Francesco, and second son\r\n  of Don Giovanni Muzio Attendolo, detto Sforza.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  This paragraph rests entirely upon the gossip and conjectures of\r\n  Manfredi, Orator of Ferrara at Florence; Stefano Infessura (Ed.\r\n  Tommasini); Hans Burchard (Ed Thuasne); Bernardino Corio (Storia di\r\n  Milano).\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  For an English parallel of riotous superlatives, compare the\r\n  inscription on a picture of Elizabeth in the Hall of the\r\n  Post-Reformation Jesus College, Oxford.\r\n\r\n  “Diva Elizabetha Virgo Invictissima Semper Augusta Plus Quam Caesarea\r\n  Angliæ Franciae et Hiberniae Potentissima Imperatrix Fidei Christianae\r\n  Fortissima Propugnatrix Literarum Omnium Scientissima Fautrix Immenso\r\n  Oceani Felicissima Triumphatrix Collegii Jesu Oxon Fundatrix.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  Sdegnati di questa collazione contro del Papa, il Re tenne il dì\r\n  medesimo gran consiglio, dove furono proposte e trattate piu cose\r\n  contro del Papa in riformatione della chiesa. (Dispatch of 31 Aug.\r\n  1493, Canestrini, Négociations avec la Toscane. I. 249.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  There is a tale about this personage, that, having allowed himself to\r\n  be frightened by one of the calumnies of Cardinal Giuliano della\r\n  Rovere, to the effect that the Pope expected to be paid for the red\r\n  hat (in addition to the six hundred ducats which every cardinal offers\r\n  in return for the cardinalitial sapphire ring), he became so nervous\r\n  on Ash Wednesday, when it was his office to scatter ashes on the head\r\n  of the Sovereign Pontiff, as to substitute for the formula of\r\n  administration, “Memento, homo, quia pulvis es, et in pulverem\r\n  reverteris,” the words “Memento, homo, quia Papa es, et ego pecunias\r\n  non habeo.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  Infessura, in Eccard II. 2015.

Every patrician had the right to\r\n  inflict it on his plebeians; and every inventory of palaces begins\r\n  with “Ropes for the Cord.” In many palaces and castles, iron rings\r\n  through which the Cord was passed remain to be seen. The witness had\r\n  his hands tied, hanging loosely behind him. One end of the long Cord\r\n  was attached to his wrists; the other end was flung over a beam or\r\n  through a ring and held by the official torturer. Then the witness\r\n  delicately was drawn up as high as possible. He hung there by his\r\n  wrists which were strained backward and upward, with his shoulders\r\n  generally dislocated. Then, with a frightful jerk he was dropped to\r\n  within a braccia (2 feet 7 inches) of the floor, completing the\r\n  dislocation with a shock. At this moment, the Question was put; his\r\n  answer distinguished from his shrieks, and written down. Any\r\n  stubbornness, or insolence, or reticence, was met by attaching weights\r\n  to his feet, and subjecting him to fresh elevations and fresh drops,\r\n  till his arms were torn from the sockets and his sinews strained to\r\n  the uttermost. Or, as a variant, he was left to hang until his\r\n  questioner had obtained the information required. Evidence of\r\n  commoners, without the Question, appears to have been considered by\r\n  the Fifteenth Century as valueless as evidence unsupported by oath or\r\n  affidavit and untested by cross-examination at the present day. The\r\n  nearest modern equivalent to the Torture of the Cord would be the\r\n  smelling of a greasy testament _plus_ the stratagems of a\r\n  cross-examining counsel. It was merely a legal form.\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  “Una de las mas principales causas que dava, para que el Cardenal de\r\n  Valencia dexasse el capelo era, porque siendo a quel Cardenal,\r\n  mientras en la Iglesia estuviesse, era bastante para impedir que no se\r\n  hiziesse in reformacion.”—Zurita, 126.\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  But She won a signal and decisive victory there, with the aid of Our\r\n  Lady of Victory (Νιχή, Poliziano would have said), in 1572.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  “Mores esse profligatos pietatis studium restinctum, flagitiorum\r\n  licentiam solutam, sanctissimas pretio indignissimis addici—remque\r\n  esse in extremum poene discrimen adductam.”—(Osorius De rebus gestis\r\n  Emanuelis, Op.

The _Princeps_ of the Holy Roman\r\n  Empire only becomes _Caesar Romanorum Imperator Semper Augustus mundi\r\n  totius Dominus universis dominis universis principibus et populis\r\n  Semper Venerandus_ by the herald’s proclamation after he has been\r\n  stripped, anointed, clothed in the consecrated dalmatica, ordained\r\n  deacon, and crowned with the Iron Crown of Monza and the Gold Diadem\r\n  of the Empire by the hands of the Supreme Pontiff Himself. The title\r\n  at present is dormant. If the sovereign is of the Swabian House,\r\n  precedent demands that he must go to Monza or to Sant’ Ambrogio at\r\n  Milan for the Iron Crown, and to San Giovanni Laterano at Rome for the\r\n  Gold Diadem. But Imperial coronations, (the sovereign not being of the\r\n  Swabian House,) at the Pope’s pleasure have taken place elsewhere.\r\n  Caesar Friedrich IV was the last Emperor crowned in Rome. Caesar\r\n  Francis II was the last to wear the imperial crown. He resigned it in\r\n  1806, having taken the title of Emperor of Austria in 1804. Before\r\n  coronation by the Pope the title of “The Elect-Emperor” is used; and\r\n  that is all which Maximilian can claim.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  “Non de prefato duca sed de Nobis et dicta muliere soluta.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  Gregorovius F., _Lucrezia Borgia_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  The present writer once witnessed the reception, in all amity, by the\r\n  present Sforza, of the present Pasolini dell’ Onda, who came peaceably\r\n  to gain information for his book in praise of Madonna Caterina\r\n  Sforza-Riario.

The Hospitallers were dedicated to the\r\n  service of the poor; and wore a black habit, with an eight-pointed\r\n  Maltese Cross, in white, on the breast. They took vows of poverty,\r\n  chastity and obedience. The Regular Foundation was delayed till 1104\r\n  when Baldwin I was king in Jerusalem. The Rule was that of St.\r\n  Aurelius Augustine; and the Order was finally confirmed by the Bull of\r\n  the Lord Paschal P.P. II in 1113. Its Constitution admitted of Knights\r\n  of Honour and Brothers of Devotion; the former swore to defend the\r\n  Faith against all enemies, the latter to minister to pilgrims and\r\n  afflicted. There were two badges, a cross of six points in gold\r\n  enamelled white, and a crowned cross of eight points of the same, worn\r\n  on a black riband. The Order had a Priory in London before the\r\n  Reformation—St. John of Jerusalem in Clerkenwell—whose original gate\r\n  and crypt may yet be seen.

II, their guest.\r\n\r\nFootnote 129:\r\n\r\n  Could any hint be more obscurely obvious, more insinuatory of\r\n  compliment?

XIII accorded that\r\n  formal Recognition of the late Queen’s Majesty as Queen, by the\r\n  presence of an Apostolic Ablegate at the Jubilee of 1887. In the\r\n  course of this book the immense importance which sovereigns of the\r\n  Borgian Era attached to this Recognition has been shewn. They were\r\n  ready to fight for it, knowing that without it they could not hope to\r\n  stand. In the present instance it was not even asked for; and its\r\n  spontaneous granting by the Roman Pontiff should emphasize the fact\r\n  that, what formerly might have been a matter for discussion, is now an\r\n  imperative religious duty, namely, undeviating loyalty to the Royal\r\n  and Imperial Dynasty of Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nFootnote 135:\r\n\r\n  Ἀλκμήνη. It is curious to note the survival of Greek names in the\r\n  ancient families of Etruria.\r\n\r\nFootnote 136:\r\n\r\n  The Legion of Honour is a French Order founded during the Consulate of\r\n  Napoleon Buonaparte, 20 Fiorile, An. x: ratified by the Christian King\r\n  Louis XVIII on VI July, 1814. It is governed by a Grand Master who is\r\n  the Emperor, King, or President of France according to the fashion. It\r\n  contains five classes. The Knights and Officers wear silver crosses.\r\n  The Commanders, Grand Officers and Grand Crosses wear the decoration\r\n  in gold. The motto is HONNEUR ET PATRIE. (_Tettoni e Saladini. Teatro\r\n  Araldico._)\r\n\r\nFootnote 137:\r\n\r\n  The Order of the Two Sicilies were founded by Joseph Buonaparte, XXIV\r\n  Feb. 1808, to recompense loyalty, courage, and long service. (_Tettoni\r\n  e Saladini. Teatro Araldico._)\r\n\r\nFootnote 138:\r\n\r\n  The Order of St. Gregory the Great was founded by the Lord Gregory\r\n  P.P. XVI for Merit, Civil and Military, 1 Sept. 1831. There are four\r\n  classes, viz. First, and Second Grand Cross, Commanders, and Knights.\r\n  The obverse of the octagonal silver medal bears an eight-pointed cross\r\n  in red enamel, with a shield in pretence shewing an effigy of the Lord\r\n  St. Gregory P.P. I the Great (the Pope who sent St. Augustine to\r\n  convert the English, A.D. 596.) The reverse bears the legend, PRO DEO\r\n  ET PRINCIPE GREGORIUS XVI. P.M. ANNO I. (_Tettoni e Saladini. Teatro\r\n  Araldico._)\r\n\r\nFootnote 139:\r\n\r\n  On the second of April 1814, M. le Comte d’Artois permitted the\r\n  National Guard of Paris to wear a silver Fleurdelys suspended from a\r\n  white watered riband, in recognition of service. On the twenty-sixth\r\n  of April, a Star was substituted for the Fleurdelys, and a blue border\r\n  added to the white riband. The Decoration was called the Order of the\r\n  Lily of France, and all _decorés_ made to swear an oath of fidelity to\r\n  God, and of obedience to the King, (_Tettoni e Saladini.
