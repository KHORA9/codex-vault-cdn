In 1763, its number was\r\nchanged to Eighteen, which number it bore till it was disbanded in\r\n1821. The history of its achievements has been written by Captain H.\r\nMalet.\r\n\r\nThe second regiment that bore the number was raised at a critical\r\nperiod in our history, in 1779. It had but a brief and uneventful\r\nexistence, and was disbanded in 1783.\r\n\r\nThe third regiment was raised as the Twenty-Third Light Dragoons in\r\n1781, for service in India, where it was immediately sent; the first\r\nBritish cavalry regiment that went to India. On the disbandment of\r\nthe second regiment, in 1783, the Twenty-third was re-numbered the\r\nNineteenth, and, for fourteen years, it continued to be the only\r\nBritish cavalry regiment in India. During the twenty-four years\r\nof its sojourn in the East it bore a conspicuous share in every\r\nimportant military undertaking of the time, with the exception of the\r\ncampaign against Holkar when it was too far distant from the scene of\r\naction to take part. Those twenty-four years, from Warren Hastings\r\nto Wellesley, mark the turning point of our power in India. When\r\nthe Nineteenth landed at Madras our very existence in Southern India\r\nhung in the balance. The gallantry of our army was paralysed by the\r\nfeebleness of the administration that directed their efforts. When\r\nthe regiment re-embarked for England, the supremacy of our military\r\npower had been fully established. Under their distinguished leader,\r\nJohn Floyd, the Nineteenth played no small part in the campaigns\r\nof 1790, ’91, and ’92, against Tippoo, attracting to themselves an\r\namount of interest in Southern India that no other regiment did. They\r\nassisted at the capture of Pondicherry, and the crowning victory of\r\nSeringapatam. It was their good fortune to serve under the Duke of\r\nWellington in the first independent commands he held in the field.\r\nThey took part in the destruction of the noted freebooter Dhoondia\r\nWao; a short but stirring campaign that deserves more notice than\r\nit generally receives. At Assaye, the charge of the Nineteenth and\r\nthe native cavalry brigaded with them restored the fortunes of the\r\nfight at a critical moment. They played their part at Argaum, and,\r\na few months before sailing from India, were actors with Gillespie\r\nin his remarkable feat at Vellore. Soon after the declaration of\r\nwar by the United States against Great Britain, in 1812, they were\r\nsent to Canada. The conditions of that war afforded little scope for\r\ncavalry action, so that the share of the Nineteenth in the various\r\noperations was a subordinate one. The campaigns on the Canadian\r\nfrontier have been so completely eclipsed by our struggles against\r\nNapoleon in Europe, that the arduous nature of the lake and forest\r\nwarfare carried on by a mere handful of British troops and Canadian\r\nmilitia is hardly known. A squadron of the Nineteenth, under an\r\nofficer whose whole career was identified with the regiment, formed\r\nfor eighteen months part of the small band that upheld the honour\r\nof the British arms under Sir Gordon Drummond, at Lundy’s Lane and\r\nother actions on the Niagara frontier. In the course of the wholesale\r\nreductions that took place after Waterloo this fine regiment ceased\r\nto exist, and its place in the Army List knew it no more.\r\n\r\nThe fourth regiment, the one that now bears the title of the\r\nNineteenth Princess of Wales’ Own Hussars, was originally raised\r\nby the East India Company on the outbreak of the Mutiny of the\r\nBengal Army, and received its present number on the transfer of its\r\nservices to the Crown. In 1882, they formed part of the expedition\r\nto Egypt under Lord Wolseley, to put down the rebellion of Arabi\r\nPasha. In 1884, they formed part of the expedition to Suakin under\r\nSir Gerald Graham, and fought at El-Teb and Tamai, suffering severe\r\nlosses in the first of the two actions. In 1885, they were selected\r\nby Lord Wolseley to form part of the expedition to Khartoum; the\r\nonly horsemen that accompanied the force. The Head Quarters of the\r\nregiment formed part of the Desert Column, under Sir Herbert Stewart,\r\nand fought at Abu Klea and Abu Krou, while a squadron of the regiment\r\naccompanied the River Column, under General Earle, and were present\r\nat the action at Kirbekan. A third portion of the regiment was at the\r\nsame time employed at Suakin, where it experienced serious losses.\r\nFor its services in 1885 the regiment was granted the distinctive\r\ntitle it now bears; a proof that it is no unworthy successor of the\r\nregiment that helped to strengthen the foundations of our power in\r\nIndia, under Cornwallis, Harris and Wellington, and whose honourable\r\nbadges it wears, in addition to those it has won for itself.\r\n\r\nThe history of a regiment of the British Army is part of the history\r\nof the Empire at some of its most momentous epochs. To understand\r\nit properly, requires a setting of general history that cannot be\r\ndispensed with. In compiling these annals I have chiefly aimed at\r\nproviding a work that shall be of interest and use to those who have\r\nserved, or, in the future may serve, in the regiment. At the same\r\ntime there is much which will, I believe, be of interest to the\r\nstudent of Indian Military History, and will not be unacceptable to\r\nthe general reader.\r\n\r\nThe bones of British soldiers lie scattered far and wide. In every\r\nportion of the globe, their unmarked graves are strewed on mountain\r\nand plain, by stream and forest, by swamp and desert; silent\r\nwitnesses of their devotion to their Sovereign and country. But they\r\nhave not died in vain, if the remembrance of their achievements\r\nsurvives, to swell the hearts and nerve the arms of their successors,\r\nand to remind their countrymen what they owe to their sufferings and\r\ntheir valour.\r\n\r\nIn compiling these Annals I have received assistance from many\r\nunexpected sources. To Mr W. C. L. Floyd I am indebted for much\r\nassistance from the papers of his grandfather, under whom the 19th\r\nLight Dragoons won their spurs in the Mysore campaigns; to Major\r\nGeneral Gillespie, who has kindly placed at my disposal the only\r\nauthentic portrait of his celebrated grandfather; and to Lieut.\r\nGeneral Sir Francis Norman, who collected notes of the career of\r\nthe old 19th Light Dragoons, many years ago. My thanks are also due\r\nto Mr James Wilson and Major Ernest Cruikshank of the Lundy’s Lane\r\nHistorical Society, who have done so much to rescue from oblivion\r\nthe details of the war on the Niagara frontier, and to Mr Douglas\r\nBrymner, the Dominion Government Archivist at Ottawa. I am also\r\nindebted to Mr S. M. Milne for the kindly interest he has taken\r\nin my work; to Lt. Colonel Frank Barrow who placed at my disposal\r\nthe letters written by his distinguished brother during the Soudan\r\ncampaigns of 1884 and 1885, to Colonel K. J. W. Coghill, C.B., who\r\ncommanded the regiment at Tel-el-Kebir, and to Colonel J. C. Hanford,\r\nC.B. (formerly Hanford-Flood) who commanded the squadron with the\r\nRiver Column, without whose encouragement and aid this work would not\r\nhave been undertaken. I refrain from adding more names, but the list\r\nof those to whom my thanks are due is not exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART I\r\n\r\n  THE NINETEENTH LIGHT DRAGOONS\r\n\r\n  DROGHEDA’S HORSE--1759-1763\r\n\r\n  PAGE\r\n\r\n  State of affairs in Europe in 1756--Declaration of War against\r\n  France--Increase of the Army--Early Years of the War--Invasion\r\n  expected--Orders for raising the 19th Light Dragoons--Death of\r\n  George II.--End of the Seven Years’ War--Reduction of Military\r\n  Establishments--19th Light Dragoons become the 18th--Uniform of\r\n  the Regiment                                                       1\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART II\r\n\r\n  THE NINETEENTH LIGHT DRAGOONS\r\n\r\n  1779-1783\r\n\r\n  War in America--Declaration of War by France--Increase\r\n  of the Army--Orders for raising the 19th Light\r\n  Dragoons--Uniform--Peace proclaimed--Reduction of Military\r\n  Establishments--Regiment disbanded                                10\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART III\r\n\r\n  THE TWENTY-THIRD, AFTERWARDS THE NINETEENTH LIGHT DRAGOONS\r\n\r\n  (1781-1822)\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.--1781-1782\r\n\r\n  THE TWENTY-THIRD LIGHT DRAGOONS.\r\n\r\n  Alarming state of Public Affairs--Want of Cavalry in\r\n  India--Orders for raising the 23rd Light Dragoons--Colonel\r\n  Sir John Burgoyne--Regiment embark for India--Arrive\r\n  in Madras--Desperate State of Affairs--Madras\r\n  Misgovernment--Horses for the Regiment                            19\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n  TROUBLES AT MADRAS--1783-1785\r\n\r\n  Sultan Tippoo Sahib of Mysore--Operations in Southern\r\n  India--Death of Sir Eyre Coote--Attack on Cuddalore--Peace\r\n  with France--Tippoo makes Peace--Strained relations between\r\n  civil and military in India--The E.I.

In India, under the veil of alliance with\r\nopposing Native Princes, war was actively prosecuted, and it was with\r\ndifficulty that British interests maintained a precarious footing\r\nin that country. In North America, the French claimed the whole\r\ncontinent, except the ill defined New England settlements along the\r\ncoast, and denied the right of the English to trade in the interior.\r\nKeeping themselves in the background, they waged a bloody war against\r\nthe English settlers, by means of the Indians, whom they subsidized,\r\nand whose disguise they often adopted. Both in the East and the West,\r\nFrench officials were acting with the support and countenance of the\r\nCourt of Versailles, and the English officials on the spot were not\r\nslow to retaliate when occasion offered. It was evident that a crisis\r\ncould not long be averted, but it was advantageous to the French to\r\npostpone an open rupture as long as possible, while the French navy\r\nwas being strengthened. On the other hand, it was the interest of\r\nEngland to hasten the rupture, when war was seen to be inevitable,\r\nsince the objects to be fought for were beyond the seas. The English\r\nnavy was, at that time, greatly superior in strength to the French\r\nnavy, while the French military forces were eight or ten times as\r\nstrong as the English army, which had been greatly reduced since the\r\nconclusion of the late war. As time went on, less pains were taken\r\nto conceal the warlike measures undertaken on either side. In the\r\nbeginning of 1755, Braddock’s ill-fated expedition was dispatched to\r\nNew England, while a counter-expedition for Canada was sent out from\r\nBrest and Rochefort, a few weeks later. Neither side was acting in\r\ngood faith: on both sides, secret instructions for active hostilities\r\nwere given to the commanders. In June, two French ships, with troops\r\non board, were captured by Boscawen off the coast of Newfoundland.\r\nExactly a month later, Braddock’s force was cut to pieces by the\r\nFrench and Indians. Still the pretence of peace was preserved. In\r\nApril 1756, a French expedition sailed from Toulon to attack Minorca,\r\nwhich for half a century had been a British possession. Byng’s\r\nwell-known failure to relieve Minorca ensued, and the place fell on\r\n27th June.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the absurdity of maintaining the semblance of peace under\r\nsuch circumstances had become patent to the British cabinet, and in\r\nMay, war was formally declared. In August, the coalition of France\r\nand Austria, soon to be joined by Russia, was declared against\r\nPrussia, and Great Britain found herself engaged in hostilities in\r\nGermany, India and America at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe early years of the war were neither fortunate nor creditable to\r\nGreat Britain. After the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, the Army within\r\nthe three kingdoms had been reduced to about eighteen thousand men.\r\nIn December 1755, an increase of fifteen thousand men had been voted.\r\nBut armies are not made in a day, and the direction of affairs was\r\nin incompetent hands. Pitt, who alone commanded the confidence of\r\nthe country, was regarded with disfavour by the King. In November\r\n1756, Pitt was recalled to office, and a new spirit was infused\r\ninto the management of affairs. A Militia Bill was introduced, the\r\nregular Army was increased to forty-five thousand men, and steps\r\nwere taken for enlisting into the service of the State the Highland\r\nclans who had so recently been in arms against the Crown. In April\r\n1757, Pitt was dismissed from office, and all again was confusion.\r\nFor three months England was without a Government; at the end of that\r\ntime, Pitt was again in office. But the ill effects of the political\r\ncontest at home were reflected in the ill-success of our arms abroad,\r\nand two years were to elapse before the nation felt secure. The year\r\n1757 was a gloomy one in England. A French invasion was believed to\r\nbe imminent: an expedition, dispatched in May, against Louisbourg in\r\nAmerica, failed, owing to the feebleness and tardiness of execution\r\non the part of those to whom it was entrusted: Fort William Henry\r\nwas taken by Montcalm, and its garrison massacred by the Indians. In\r\nEurope, an expedition, dispatched in September, against Rochefort,\r\nfailed, through the disagreements of the naval and military officers\r\nin command. The Duke of Cumberland was forced to evacuate Hanover,\r\nand sign the convention of Kloster-Severn, and many months were\r\nto elapse before the triumph of Clive at Plassy became known in\r\nEngland. In 1758, matters improved somewhat. In July, Louisbourg was\r\ntaken, but an attack on Ticonderago in the same month was defeated,\r\nand Lord Howe, described by Wolfe as “the noblest Englishman that has\r\nappeared in my time, and the best soldier in the British army,” was\r\nslain in a skirmish. In Germany, the British troops, under Prince\r\nFerdinand of Brunswick, drove the French out of Hanover, while two\r\nsuccessful raids were made on the French coast, in which Cherbourg\r\nand St. Servan were temporarily occupied, and a great quantity of\r\nwarlike stores destroyed or captured.\r\n\r\nPitt’s genius was now beginning to be felt in every branch of the\r\nservice, and, from this time, matters improved steadily, by land and\r\nsea. In May 1759, Guadaloupe was captured. In July, Rodney destroyed\r\nthe French boats in Havre prepared for the invasion of England, while\r\nHawke blockaded Brest. In August, Boscawen defeated a French fleet\r\nin the Bay of Lagos. In the same month, the French were decisively\r\ndefeated at Minden by an inferior English and Hanoverian force:\r\non the 13th September, Quebec was taken by Wolfe, who fell in the\r\nmoment of victory, and French interests in America received their\r\ndeath blow. To complete the year’s triumphs, on 20th November, Hawke\r\ndestroyed a French fleet under Conflans in Quiberon Bay, in an action\r\nfought in the midst of a tempest. The nation could breathe freely\r\nagain; there was no more fear of invasion, and England was confident\r\nof ultimate success. But Pitt’s efforts were not relaxed, and many\r\nregiments of Cavalry and Infantry were added to the Army during the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nBy Royal Warrants, dated respectively 17th March, 4th August, 10th\r\nOctober and 17th November 1759, the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th Light\r\nDragoons were raised for service abroad and at home. In December,\r\nsteps were taken to raise the 19th Regiment of Light Dragoons in\r\nIreland, and, in the following month, a Notification to that effect\r\nwas issued from Dublin Castle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_By the Lord Lieutenant General and General Governor of Ireland._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1760.]\r\n\r\n  Bedford,\r\n\r\n  His Majesty having been pleased to Order a Regiment of Light\r\n  Dragoons to be forthwith raised in this Kingdom, under the\r\n  Command of the Earl of Drogheda,[1] to consist of one Lieutenant\r\n  Colonel Commandant, one Lieutenant Colonel, one Major, three\r\n  Captains, six Lieutenants, six Cornets, one Chaplain, one\r\n  Surgeon, one Surgeon’s Mate, one Adjutant, six Quartermasters,\r\n  eighteen Serjeants, eighteen Corporals, twelve Drummers, six\r\n  Hautboys, and six Troops of seventy Men per Troop: and His\r\n  Majesty’s Letter being shortly expected for placing the said\r\n  Regiment upon the Military Establishment of this Kingdom from the\r\n  seventh day of December last past inclusive, to be paid at such\r\n  times and in such manner as other Regiments of Dragoons in this\r\n  Kingdom are paid, the pay of such Commission and Staff Officers\r\n  and the Subsistance of the Non Commission Officers to commence\r\n  from the date of their respective Commission, Warrants, and\r\n  Appointments, and the Subsistance of the private Men, approved\r\n  by the Officer who shall be appointed to review them from the\r\n  Days of their being severally attested inclusive.

Given at our Court of St.\r\n  James the 12th day of February 1760 in the 33rd Year of our reign.\r\n\r\n  By His Majesty’s Command,\r\n\r\n      HOLLES NEWCASTLE.\r\n      H. B. LEGGE.\r\n      JAMES OSWALD.\r\n\r\n  Entered at the Signet office\r\n  the 25th February 1760\r\n\r\n      GEO. BROWN, _Dy._\r\n\r\n  To Our Right Trusty and Right Entirely Beloved Cousin and\r\n  Councillor John Duke of Bedford Lieutenant General and General\r\n  Governor of our Kingdom of Ireland and to Our Lieutenant Deputy\r\n  or other Chief Governor or Governors of that Our Kingdom for the\r\n  time being.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th March, the Muster Master General was again addressed,\r\nand instructed that, in consequence of an application from the Earl\r\nof Drogheda, “the orders relating to the Magistrates attesting the\r\nmen raised to be Protestants and to making returns of the several\r\nplaces where the recruits were enlisted may be dispensed with, proper\r\ncertificates that the men are Protestants having been obtained from\r\nthe Clergymen of the Parishes where such men were severally enlisted,\r\nand all other requisites in the Earl of Rothes’ said instructions\r\nhaving been complied with.”\r\n\r\nOn 25th October 1760, George II. died; in February 1763, the Peace of\r\nParis was concluded, and the Seven Years’ War came to an end. During\r\nthe whole of this time, the Regiment, which was generally known as\r\n“Drogheda’s Horse,” remained in Ireland; but little or nothing can\r\nbe learned concerning it. Considerable reductions of establishment\r\nwere made directly peace was assured. The 17th (Aberdour’s Horse),\r\nwhich had never been able to complete its strength, ceased to exist,\r\nand the 18th Light Dragoons became the 17th. The 19th in the same way\r\nbecame the 18th, under which number it gained much distinction in\r\nthe West Indies, Holland, the Peninsula, and Waterloo, being finally\r\ndisbanded in 1821. Lord Drogheda, who had raised the regiment,\r\ncontinued to be its Colonel Commandant till its disbandment, nearly\r\nsixty two years afterwards, an unbroken term of service with one\r\nregiment probably unparalleled.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible at this date to ascertain what was the uniform of\r\nthe regiment, before its number was changed. It certainly wore the\r\nred light dragoon coat of the period, and the facings were probably\r\nwhite, with red and white lace, similar to what it wore after its\r\nnumber was changed, until blue was substituted for red in all the\r\nLight Dragoon regiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE NINETEENTH LIGHT DRAGOONS\r\n\r\n1779-1783\r\n\r\n  War in America--Declaration of War by France--Increase of the\r\n  Army--Orders for raising the 19th Light Dragoons--Uniform--Peace\r\n  proclaimed--Reduction of Military Establishments--Regiment\r\n  disbanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The year of which we treat, presented the most aweful appearance\r\nof public affairs, which this country had perhaps beheld for many\r\nages.”[2] The condition of affairs in England, in 1779, was truly\r\nalarming. Since the spring of 1775, Great Britain had been striving\r\nto subdue her rebellious colonies in America. The war was mismanaged,\r\nthe Ministry was incapable: the successes gained were barren of\r\nresults, while serious disasters had been experienced. In March 1778,\r\nFrance, which had long been secretly aiding the rebellious colonies,\r\nthrew off the mask, and openly espoused their cause. The warlike\r\nspirit of the country was roused, and those who would have conceded\r\npeace on almost any terms to American demands, refused to consider\r\nit at the intervention of France. The French forces however effected\r\nnothing of importance during the year; towards the end of it, the\r\nprobability of Spain joining the coalition against England became\r\nknown, though the actual declaration of war was delayed till June\r\n1779. The national spirit was now thoroughly roused, but there was\r\ngreat apprehension of invasion. Supplies were freely voted, great\r\nadditions were made to the naval and military establishments, camps\r\nwere formed in many places in the south of England, the militia were\r\nembodied, and militia camps formed at Cox Heath, Warley, Portsmouth,\r\nPlymouth, Chatham, and Aldborough. The most strenuous efforts were\r\nmade to place the defences of the country on an efficient footing.\r\n\r\nIn April, the following Letter of Service was addressed to Major\r\nGeneral Russell Manners, Lieutenant-Colonel of the 2nd Dragoon Guards.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Warrant._\r\n\r\n  _George R._ Whereas we have thought fit to order a Regiment of\r\n  Light Dragoons to be forthwith formed under your Command which\r\n  is to consist of six troops with four Sergeants four Corporals\r\n  one Trumpeter one Hautboy and fifty-four private men and horses\r\n  in each Troop beside the usual number of Commissioned Officers:\r\n  These are to authorize you by beat of drum or otherwise to raise\r\n  so many men in any County or part of our Kingdom of Great Britain\r\n  as shall be wanted to complete the said Regiment to the numbers\r\n  above mentioned. And all Magistrates Justices of the Peace\r\n  Constables and other our Civil Officers whom it may concern are\r\n  hereby required to be assisting unto you in providing Quarters\r\n  impressing carriages and otherwise as there shall be occasion.\r\n\r\n  Given this 25th day of April 1779 in the 19th year of our Reign.\r\n\r\n  By His Majesty’s Command\r\n      C. JENKINSON.\r\n\r\n  To Our Trusty and Wellbeloved Russell Manners Esq.\r\n        &c.      &c.      &c.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, similar Warrants were issued for raising the 20th\r\nand 21st Light Dragoons.\r\n\r\nIn July, a small Corps of Light Dragoons, known as Lister’s Corps,\r\nwas raised, and in August, the 22nd Light Dragoons was formed. At the\r\nsame time, all out pensioners of Chelsea were inspected to see which\r\nof them “were fit for garrison or other duty.”\r\n\r\nThe 19th Light Dragoons were formed by drafts from the 1st and\r\n2nd Dragoon Guards, and the 4th and 10th Dragoons, and encamped\r\nat Salisbury; where also were the 11th Light Dragoons. The 15th,\r\n20th, and 21st Light Dragoons were encamped on Lexden Heath near\r\nColchester. On the 9th October 1779, the 19th were inspected by\r\nLieutenant-General James Johnston, when the effective strength was\r\n355 Non-Commissioned Officers and Privates, and 347 horses. The\r\nInspecting Officer reported that the Officers wore scarlet, with\r\nsilver button holes and green lappels, and “were mostly young genteel\r\nmen with a good air, and great attention, and tolerable horsemen.”\r\nThe Non-Commissioned Officers were said to be too tall for Light\r\nDragoons, few of them being under 5 ft. 10 in.\r\n\r\nFurther orders for recruiting were issued in February 1780, and\r\nagain in February 1781. Regimental clothing accounts were formidable\r\nthings in those days, and two years after the Regiment was raised\r\nit was found that the clothing money of the men drafted to the 19th\r\nLight Dragoons from other Regiments had been paid, for two years, to\r\nthe wrong person; so the following warrant, directing Major-General\r\nManners to refund, was issued.\r\n\r\n  _“Warrant to make good a deficiency in the Offreckonings of the\r\n  several Regiments of Dragoon Guards and Dragoons within specified\r\n  from 25th April 1779 to 5th July 1781 out of ye Offreckonings of\r\n  ye 19th 20th and 21st Regiments of Light Dragoons which were\r\n  formed by sundry Non Commissioned Officers and Private Men turned\r\n  over from the said Regiments of Dragoon Guards and Dragoons.”_\r\n\r\n  _George R._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1781.]\r\n\r\n  Whereas we were pleased to direct that our several Regiments of\r\n  Dragoon Guards and Dragoons should be augmented from the 25th\r\n  March 1778 and also further augmented from 25th August following\r\n  and Whereas on the 25th April 1779 We were pleased to order three\r\n  Regts. of Light Dragoons to be formed (out of a proper number\r\n  of Non Commissioned Officers and Private Men turned over to\r\n  them from the several Regiments of Dragoon Guards and Dragoons\r\n  as specified in the State hereunto annexed), and whereas in\r\n  Consequence of this We were pleased to direct that each Troop of\r\n  our said Regiments of Dragoon Guards and Dragoons should from the\r\n  25th April 1779, be reduced so as to consist of Two Sergeants,\r\n  Two Corporals, One Trumpeter, One Hautbois and thirty seven\r\n  Private Men, and no more besides the usual Commissioned and other\r\n  Officers, whereby a Deficiency hath arisen in the Assignment of\r\n  the Offreckoning of each of our said Corps between 25th April\r\n  1779 and 5th July 1781 and We having been most humbly besought to\r\n  grant Our Warrants to make good the said deficiency It appearing\r\n  that the several Colonels above mentioned did turn over the Non\r\n  Commissioned Officers and Private Men (Specified against each of\r\n  their names in the State annexed) fully clothed and appointed\r\n  according to our Regulations, Our Will and Pleasure therefore\r\n  is that out of the Offreckonings arising on the Establishment\r\n  of each of the new Corps specified in the annexed State and\r\n  directed by our Warrant of the 29th March 1781, to be retained\r\n  in your hands, you do pay from time to time to the said several\r\n  Colonels or their Assigns the Amount (as the same hath or shall\r\n  become payable according to the custom of the Service) of the\r\n  Offreckonings of the Non Commissioned Officers and Private Men\r\n  turned over to the New Corps that have accrued from 25th April\r\n  1779 to 5th July following as also that shall accrue from 6th\r\n  July 1779 to 5th July 1781, in full satisfaction of the Claims of\r\n  the said several Colonels of Our said Regiments of Dragoon Guards\r\n  and Dragoons for the deficiency on their respective Assignments\r\n  already passed by them up to 5th July 1779 and 5th July 1781, And\r\n  for so doing &c.

The declaration of war by Holland,\r\nin January 1781, caused their transfer to Norwich, and, during\r\nthe summer of that year, they were distributed between Saxmundham,\r\nBungay, Beccles, Yarmouth, Halesworth, and Woodbridge, with a troop\r\nat each place. In October, the Regiment was inspected at Yarmouth by\r\nMajor-General Tryon, who reported “This Regiment is a good corps, and\r\nfitt for any Service.” Each Dragoon was armed with a sword, a pair of\r\npistols, carbine and bayonet.\r\n\r\nIn the following spring, the Regiment was at Bury St. Edmunds and\r\nSudbury, three troops at each place. Soon afterwards they were moved\r\nto the neighbourhood of London, for employment on revenue duties,\r\nand, in August, we find the Head quarters of the Regiment with three\r\nTroops at Epsom; the other three troops being quartered at Croydon,\r\nMitcham, and Horsham. Soon afterwards, a Troop was sent to Bromley,\r\nand another to Ewell, one Troop being withdrawn from Epsom.\r\n\r\nBut the Regiment was not destined to see active service. In November\r\n1782, the preliminary articles of peace had been signed, by which\r\nEngland recognised the independence of the United States, and the\r\nusual reduction of military establishments took place. In June 1783,\r\nthe Regiment was disbanded under the following order--\r\n\r\n_Orders and Instructions for Disbanding the 19th Regiment of Light\r\nDragoons._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1783.]\r\n\r\n  Whereas We have thought fit to Order that Our 19th Regiment of\r\n  (Light) Dragoons, under your Command be forthwith disbanded,\r\n  Our Will and Pleasure is, that you, or such person or persons\r\n  as you shall appoint for this Service, do immediately repair to\r\n  the respective Quarters of the Troops of Our Said Regiment, and\r\n  disband them accordingly and that in the disbanding of them the\r\n  following Rules be observed--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1st.]\r\n\r\n  Before such disbanding You are to cause an exact Muster to be\r\n  taken of the several Troops of the said Regiment, which You may\r\n  draw together at some convenient place and You are to transmit\r\n  to Our Secretary at War, for Our Information, an Account of their\r\n  Condition and Numbers at the time of Disbanding, together with an\r\n  exact List of the Names and Rank of the Officers, specifying also\r\n  if any of them holds their Commissions to which Pay is annexed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2nd.]\r\n\r\n  It being Our Intention only to pay off at present, and clear the\r\n  Non Commissioned Officers and Private Men of Our Said Regiments,\r\n  (and give an allowance of Half Pay to the Commissioned Officers\r\n  entitled thereto, from the time of their Disbanding), You are\r\n  to take care before their Disbanding, that the Quarters of each\r\n  Troop be duly satisfied, that the Accounts between the Non\r\n  Commissioned Officers and Private Men hereby disbanded, and their\r\n  Officers, be made up, and that they be fully satisfied, and paid\r\n  their Arrears, Grass Money, and all other just pretentions, to\r\n  the day of their being disbanded, whereof the said Officers, are\r\n  to take Acquittances, and Discharges from them respectively,\r\n  distinguishing each head of Payment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 3rd.]\r\n\r\n  That care be taken, that the Arms delivered out of Our Stores\r\n  of Ordnance, and indented for, be returned into Our said Stores\r\n  again, and Acquittances taken for the same, from such persons as\r\n  shall be appointed to receive them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 4th.]\r\n\r\n  That care be taken that each Non Commissioned Officer and Private\r\n  Man hereby to be disbanded be permitted to carry away with him\r\n  his Cloak and Clothes which he now wears, and that their Horses\r\n  be disposed of according to the regulation following.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 5th.]\r\n\r\n  Where any Dragoon who shall be discharged in pursuance hereof,\r\n  hath served Us, One whole year, He shall be entitled to Three\r\n  Pounds in lieu of His Horse, and all the Horses of the disbanded\r\n  Men are to be Sold, and an account kept, in order to the disposal\r\n  of the Surplus Money in such Manner as We shall direct.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 6th.]\r\n\r\n  That the Dragoons who in pursuance of the above Regulation are\r\n  entitled to £3 as aforesaid, be paid six days full pay, and\r\n  those who are not so entitled, be paid Eighteen days full pay,\r\n  from the day of Disbanding, exclusive; which We are pleased to\r\n  give them, as of Our Royal Bounty, to carry them to the places\r\n  of their former Residence: You are therefore to cause payment\r\n  thereof to be made to each of them respectively and to take\r\n  Receipts for the same from each Non Commissioned Officer, and\r\n  Private Dragoon, And all such Acquittances, Discharges, and\r\n  Receipts, are to be transmitted to the Agent of the Regiment, to\r\n  be produced to Our Secretary at War, as Vouchers for the several\r\n  Payments herein directed, and for which You are to draw Bills on\r\n  the said Agent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 7th.]\r\n\r\n  You are also to send to Our Secretary at War, an Authentic List,\r\n  attested in the best manner by Yourself, or Officer performing\r\n  this Service; of the names of the Non Commissioned Officers and\r\n  Private Men, so disbanded, and to give them passes in case they\r\n  shall desire the same, to the places of their former Residence,\r\n  allowing them a convenient time to repair thither, and giving\r\n  them a strict charge that they do not presume to travel with\r\n  Arms, nor more than three in Company together, upon pain of\r\n  the severest punishment, And to the end that the said Non\r\n  Commissioned Officers and Private Dragoons may be sensible of\r\n  the care We have taken of them upon their dismission, You are to\r\n  cause these Our directions to be read at the head of each Troop,\r\n  for a more ready compliance with Our Pleasure hereby signified,\r\n  and see the same put into Execution--Given at Our Court at St.\r\n  James’s, this 12th day of June, 1783, in the twenty third Year of\r\n  Our Reign.\r\n\r\n  By His Majesty’s Command,\r\n      R.

Generals Johnston, Mocher and Sloper,\r\nrelative to the appointments of the 19th, 20th and 21st Regts. of\r\nLight Dragoons &c.,” it is stated that the appointments are little\r\nbetter than lumber. The following paragraph refers to the 19th Light\r\nDragoons--\r\n\r\n  “In regard to the seventh regiment, no report having been sent\r\n  us with your letter, and no officer having appeared before us to\r\n  give us any insight into the transaction between the Colonels of\r\n  that and the 19th Regiment of Light Dragoons, we can only say,\r\n  that as the 19th light Regt. was raised at the same time, and has\r\n  had pretty near the same duty, we imagine the same objections\r\n  will lay against the appointments of that regiment, as to the\r\n  others.\r\n\r\n  To Lt.

In January, a rupture occurred with Holland, so that Great\r\nBritain found herself simultaneously at war with France, Spain and\r\nHolland, while engaged at the same time with her revolted Colonies\r\nin America. The navy was overtaxed and inadequate to the demands\r\nmade on it, and the command of the sea had passed into the hands of\r\nour enemies. Gibraltar had been besieged since July 1779, the siege\r\ncontinuing till February 1783, the only assistance that could be\r\ngiven being in the shape of stores and reinforcements at uncertain\r\nintervals. In America, things had gone from bad to worse. On 19th\r\nOctober 1781, Cornwallis was forced to capitulate at Yorktown with\r\nthe whole of his army, a disaster which practically brought the\r\nwar in America to a close, though it lingered on for nearly a year\r\nand a half longer. In India, affairs were nearly as bad. The three\r\nmost important of the native powers at that time were Hyder Ali of\r\nMysore, the Mahrattas, and the Nizam of Hyderabad, and matters had so\r\nturned out that we were at war with them all three. On the outbreak\r\nof war between England and France, the French settlements quickly\r\nfell into our hands. Hyder Ali was much under French influence, and\r\nthe fall of the French Settlement at Mahé, which was detrimental to\r\nhis interests, aroused his resentment. He was an able soldier and\r\nadministrator, and his army was, at that time, the best organised\r\namong the native powers. Collecting his forces, he fell like an\r\navalanche on the Carnatic which he desolated. Some troops sent\r\nagainst him, under Colonel Baillie, were literally annihilated;\r\nanother force, under Sir Hector Munro, was obliged to retreat, so\r\nthat at the end of 1780, the Company’s authority in the South of\r\nIndia extended little beyond the precincts of the town of Madras.\r\nReinforcements were sent from Bengal under Sir Eyre Coote. The\r\nresults of the campaign of 1781 were, however, indecisive, in spite\r\nof a victory gained by Sir Eyre Coote, at Porto Novo (1st July), and\r\nsome minor successes. It was estimated that one-third of the British\r\nforces were lost in the campaign. In Western India, the Bombay\r\nGovernment had engaged in hostilities against the Mahrattas, and met\r\nwith disaster. On the coast a powerful French fleet had appeared\r\nunder Suffren, one of the ablest seamen France ever produced. The\r\nEuropean forces of the East India Company were at that time in a\r\nmiserable state. Public recruiting in England was forbidden, and the\r\nranks were filled with the refuse of society. Felons with fetters\r\non them were shipped as soldiers; foreigners and adventurers of all\r\nranks were received; many of whom only wanted a passage to India, in\r\norder that they might desert, as soon as possible, after they landed\r\nin the country; invalids, vagrants, and men under the proper size\r\nfor military service. The whole were “in a most wretched condition,\r\nalmost indeed without subordination.” The only reliable European\r\ntroops in the country were the King’s troops, and the Company’s\r\nArtillery into which the best of their recruits were drafted. Lord\r\nCornwallis, writing six years later of some troops he had recently\r\ninspected, says:\r\n\r\n  “What shall I say of the Company’s Europeans? I did not think\r\n  Britain could have furnished such a set of wretched objects--I\r\n  would infinitely rather take the 73rd regiment upon service with\r\n  me, than the whole six Company’s battalions--Indeed I have great\r\n  doubts whether by drafting the whole six, I could complete one\r\n  serviceable battalion to the present establishment.”\r\n\r\nIt is only by appreciating the condition and circumstances of our\r\nmilitary services in India at this time, and the jealousy existing in\r\nthe highest quarters in England of the exercise of the authority of\r\na Government by the East India Company, that the almost independent\r\nposition held by the King’s troops in India can be understood. The\r\nchief want was in Cavalry, and it is a proof of the ill-judged\r\nparsimony or poverty of the Company that, in a country so well\r\nadapted for that arm, where the cavalry of the enemy were counted by\r\ntens of thousands, they should have failed, till the time treated of,\r\nto produce an efficient mounted Corps. M. le Maitre de la Tour, a\r\nFrench officer in the service of Hyder Ali, writing about the events\r\nthen occurring, says:\r\n\r\n  “ ... The English have never yet succeeded in the attempt to form\r\n  a good troop of European horse in India. As they have sent a\r\n  regiment of dragoons[3] from England, it is probable that their\r\n  arrival may place the affair on another footing. Though it may\r\n  not immediately be conceived, the reason of the want of success\r\n  in forming their intended troop of horse, consisted in the good\r\n  discipline to which they were desirous of subjecting them.\r\n\r\n  “The excellence of the English cavalry is sufficiently\r\n  acknowledged in Europe: and its advantages consist less in the\r\n  goodness of the horse, than in the choice of the horsemen. The\r\n  pay of a horseman in England is such as renders his situation\r\n  very eligible; so that the sons of rich farmers and tradesmen are\r\n  very desirous of entering into the service. This being the case,\r\n  it is in the power of the officers to select handsome well-formed\r\n  men of good character, and to keep them in good discipline merely\r\n  by the fear of being dismissed. The officers who were first\r\n  entrusted with the formation of a body of cavalry in India,\r\n  thought to establish and preserve the same discipline among them,\r\n  without attending to the great difference of time, place, and\r\n  persons. The recruits sent from England to India are in general\r\n  libertines, and people of bad character: and, as the Company will\r\n  not dismiss a soldier, all the punishment inflicted on a horseman\r\n  is, to reduce him to serve in the infantry; so that a man is no\r\n  sooner put among the cavalry, than he is sent back to his former\r\n  station. The French have succeeded in forming very good cavalry\r\n  in India, by attending more to their horsemanship, and less to\r\n  their discipline and manners.”\r\n\r\nHyder Ali’s cavalry numbered at that time about twenty-five thousand\r\nhorsemen, among which was a body of French dragoons and hussars. The\r\nCompany maintained no Cavalry establishment, beyond a small European\r\ntroop formed, as related by M. le Maitre de la Tour. When at war,\r\nthey borrowed a few hundreds of horsemen from the Nawab of Arcot,\r\nunpaid, undrilled, and undisciplined.\r\n\r\nSir Eyre Coote, the Commander-in-chief in India, was loud in his\r\ndemands for Cavalry. In his dispatch on his victory at Porto Novo he\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n  “From the want of a corps of cavalry on our side equal in\r\n  number to the service required, we were, with victory decidedly\r\n  declared, obliged to halt just beyond the enemy’s grounds, not\r\n  being able to take advantage of so distinguished a day; for with\r\n  a corps of cavalry, the enemy’s guns, stores, &c., would, to a\r\n  certainty have fallen into our hands.”\r\n\r\nAgain, after the battle of Arnee, (2nd June 1782) he wrote:\r\n\r\n  “There was nothing wanting to have enabled me on this occasion\r\n  to ruin and disperse Hyder’s army, but a respectable body of\r\n  cavalry. One thing is certain, that had I such a corps we should\r\n  have captured the greatest part, if not the whole of his cannon.”\r\n\r\nUnder the urgent demands made on them, the Court of Directors applied\r\nto the Crown for the loan of a Cavalry Regiment, and, in accordance\r\nwith the usual practice at that date, it was determined to raise a\r\nRegiment for service in India. On the 24th Sept. 1781, the following\r\nWarrant was issued to Colonel Sir John Burgoyne Bart., of the 14th\r\nLight Dragoons, a cousin of General Burgoyne who surrendered at\r\nSaratoga in 1777.\r\n\r\n  _Warrant for forming a Regiment of (Light) Dragoons under the\r\n  Command of Colonel Sir John Burgoyne Bart._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1781.]\r\n\r\n  George R.\r\n\r\n  Whereas We have thought fit to Order a Regiment of Light Dragoons\r\n  to be forthwith formed under your Command which is to consist of\r\n  Six Troops with Four Serjeants, Four Corporals, One Trumpeter,\r\n  One Hautboy, and Fifty four Private Men in each Troop, beside the\r\n  usual Number of Commissioned Officers; These are to Authorize you\r\n  by beat of Drum or otherwise to raise so many men in any County\r\n  or part of Our Kingdom of Great Britain, as shall be wanted to\r\n  complete the said Regiment, to the Numbers above mentioned.

J. Venables Hinde of 16th Dragoons.\r\n\r\nThe roll of officers was completed in subsequent Gazettes, but\r\nseveral changes took place before the embarkation of the Regiment.\r\n\r\nColonel Sir John Burgoyne, Bart, of Sutton Park in Bedfordshire,\r\nwas an officer who had served in several Regiments, the 7th\r\nRoyal Fusiliers, the 52nd Foot, the 58th Foot, and was Lieutenant\r\nColonel of the 14th Light Dragoons at the time of his appointment\r\nas Colonel of the 23rd Light Dragoons. He also held the offices of\r\nComptroller of the Port of Chester, and Muster Master of foreign\r\ntroops serving in North America. On being appointed to serve in\r\nIndia, he was granted local rank as Major General in the East Indies\r\nfrom 1st June 1781, and was subsequently made Major General in the\r\nArmy, 20th November 1782.[4] It is probable that the regiment was\r\nlargely composed of drafts from the regiments that furnished it with\r\nofficers, viz.: the 8th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 20th, and 21st Light\r\nDragoons. The Regiment was first brought together in the vicinity\r\nof his home, and, under order dated 28th December, marched from\r\nBedford to Portsmouth to embark for India. The following orders and\r\ninstructions had previously been issued, and subsequent events were\r\nto show how much the admonition as to disputes with the officers of\r\nthe East India Company were needed.\r\n\r\n  _Orders and Instructions to Sir John Burgoyne Colonel of the 23rd\r\n  Regiment of (Light) Dragoons for the Conduct of his Regiment on\r\n  their passage to the East Indies dated 29th November 1781._\r\n\r\n  George R.\r\n\r\n  You will before embarking call together the Officers of the\r\n  Regiment under Your Command, and recommend to them in a\r\n  particular manner the avoiding all manner of disputes with the\r\n  Officers of the East India Company, and that they use their\r\n  utmost Endeavours to live with them in the greatest harmony, as\r\n  the contrary behaviour will be very displeasing unto Us, as well\r\n  as detrimental to the Service they are jointly to be employed\r\n  in;--the respective Officers of Companies are to recommend the\r\n  same to the Non Commissioned Officers and Soldiers under their\r\n  Command; The Officers of the East India Company having the same\r\n  orders, as to their behaviour to Our Land Forces.\r\n\r\n  You will give the strictest orders for keeping up good discipline\r\n  and regularity both whilst the Troops are on board the East India\r\n  Companie’s Ships, and on Shore, and if any Commissioned, Non\r\n  Commissioned Officer or Soldier shall be guilty of any Crime or\r\n  disorder whilst on board the said Ships, he shall be immediately\r\n  confined, and you will order Courts Martial to be held and the\r\n  delinquent to be punished there.\r\n\r\n  The Officers of our said Forces on board the said Ships, shall\r\n  give the necessary orders for the Men under their Command,\r\n  consulting with the Commanders of the said Ships, in every\r\n  thing relating to their Service on board, dividing the Men into\r\n  Watches, with a proportionable Number of Commissioned and Non\r\n  Commissioned Officers.\r\n\r\n  The necessary Orders shall likewise be given for airing the\r\n  bedding daily, for keeping the births (_sic_) clean and sweet,\r\n  for preventing gaming, and selling Drams or spirituous liquors\r\n  and putting out the Lights between Decks with all which\r\n  Commissioned Officers shall be chargeable.\r\n\r\n  No Officers or Soldiers shall go on Shore out of any of the said\r\n  Ships, without the Consent of the Captain of the Ship as well\r\n  as ye Commanding Officer of the Land Forces, and whenever any\r\n  men are allowed to go on Shore, Commissioned or Non Commissioned\r\n  Officers are to be sent with them, who are to be answerable for\r\n  their Conduct whilst on Shore, and are to make a report thereof\r\n  upon their return on board.\r\n\r\n  Weekly returns of the Officers and Men of Our said Forces, on\r\n  board each Ship, shall be constantly made out, and sent to You,\r\n  as often as opportunity offers, and Monthly returns of Our said\r\n  Forces under your Command shall be transmitted by You for Us,\r\n  to Our Secretary at War, as also a Report of every thing that\r\n  happens when you have an opportunity of sending them.\r\n\r\n  You will transmit with as much expedition as the opportunity of\r\n  time, distance and place can admit, the original proceedings and\r\n  Sentences of every General Court Martial, to the Commander in\r\n  Chief in the East Indies who is to send the same to the Judge\r\n  Advocate General in London.\r\n\r\n  In every thing you will consider the honour of Our Forces,\r\n  the good of Our Service, and the Interest of the East India\r\n  Company whose Territories and Commerce You are sent to protect\r\n  and establish, You will therefore chearfully (_sic_) concur\r\n  in all things which the principal Officers of the East India\r\n  Company shall judge conducive thereto, and for that purpose you\r\n  will use your utmost endeavours to preserve a good harmony and\r\n  understanding betwixt Our Land Forces and those of the East India\r\n  Company.\r\n\r\n  Given at Our Court at St James’s this 29th day of November 1781,\r\n  in the Twenty first Year of Our Reign.\r\n\r\n  By His Majesty’s Command\r\n      BARRINGTON.\r\n\r\nIn a letter, dated London 25th January 1782, from the East India\r\nDirectors to the President and Council at Fort St. George, the Madras\r\nauthorities were thus advised of the dispatch of the Regiment to\r\nIndia--\r\n\r\n  “His Majesty having been graciously pleased to order a Regiment\r\n  of Light Dragoons, dismounted, and two Regiments of Foot[5] to\r\n  proceed to the East Indies for the protection and defence of the\r\n  Company’s possessions, we hereby inform you that they embark on\r\n  board the ships now under dispatch for India.

In the same fleet sailed the two newly raised Infantry\r\nRegiments, a Hanoverian regiment raised to serve the East India\r\nCompany for seven years, drafts for four King’s regiments then\r\nserving in India, and some recruits, raised in Ireland, for the\r\nCompany’s service. Lieutenant Colonel Floyd, with the greater part\r\nof the Regiment, was on board the _Ceres_. Sir John Burgoyne, with\r\nthe rest of the Regiment, sailed in the _Royal Henry_. Floyd was\r\nin command of the Regiment: Sir John Burgoyne being apparently in\r\ncommand of the whole of the Troops. The voyage was an uneventful\r\none, though not without some apprehension of meeting a French\r\nfleet. It was known that a French fleet was fitting out in Brest,\r\nunder the Comte de Guiche, to intercept them. On the 27th February,\r\nintelligence was received of a combined French and Spanish fleet of\r\n41 sail of the line and 18 frigates, that was cruising to intercept\r\nthe convoy. The frigate that brought the intelligence had also passed\r\nclose to a French squadron of 14 sail, that had only just missed the\r\nconvoy: probably the squadron from Brest. But no enemy was seen, and\r\non 28th April, the fleet was safely anchored in Rio, where it lay\r\ntill 3rd June. In those days it was the custom to carry beer for\r\ntroops at sea, as a protection against scurvy. The log of the _Ceres_\r\nrecords that on 3rd March the beer had come to an end, and spirits\r\nwere served to the troops. On the 15th March, the log records that\r\nthere was “delivered to Lieut. Colonel Floyd, Commanding Officer of\r\nthe troops on board, 1 Chest of Tea belonging to the Honble Company,\r\nfor the use of the military.” Later on again the issue of spruce\r\nbeer to the troops is recorded. It is evident that much attention,\r\naccording to the medical lights of that day, was paid to the health\r\nof the troops, with a view to landing them in India in as healthy\r\na condition as possible. On the 31st March, they crossed the line\r\nwith all the ceremonies observed on those occasions, now long since\r\nobsolete. The log records that at P.M. the Captain “mustered the\r\nship’s Company to know who had crossed the Line before, when we found\r\n81 who had not, who all agreed to pay the usual forfeit except one\r\nSeaman and two Boys who were accordingly ducked three times from ye\r\nLee Main Yard Arm.” We may be sure that all on board relieved the\r\nmonotony of the voyage by taking part in the rough festivities of the\r\nday. Lt. Colonel Floyd says in a private letter, “Our dragoons are\r\ndivided into two watches, and relieve each other every four hours, so\r\nthe half of them are always on deck, chiefly for the sake of their\r\nhealth, and to assist the seamen in the operations of the ship,\r\nat which they now begin to be very handy.” On the 15th July, when\r\nnearing the Cape, a Danish ship “fresh from the Cape” was spoken,\r\nand gave news that, on the 13th, 4 French sail of the line and 9\r\ntransports were to have sailed for the Mauritius: also, that on 26th\r\nJune, a French frigate and 12 transports with troops had sailed from\r\nthe Cape. But nothing more eventful occurred, and on 6th Sept., the\r\nwhole fleet anchored in Bombay. There the convoy was broken up, and,\r\non 15th, the _Ceres_ and _Royal Henry_ sailed for Madras, where they\r\ncast anchor on 19th and 20th October. Hardly had they done so, when\r\nbad weather set in; the ships were blown from their anchorage, and,\r\nit was not till 26th and 27th October, that the Regiment disembarked;\r\nthe first British Cavalry Regiment to land in India. Three deaths\r\noccurred among the men during the voyage, Private Jonas Bateman on\r\n23rd April, Private Joseph Gardner on 4th June, and Private Simon\r\nKemp on 23rd September.\r\n\r\nThe reinforcements were sorely needed. So badly had the East India\r\nCompany’s affairs prospered that, in October, there appeared a\r\nprobability of the whole of the British establishments in southern\r\nIndia being destroyed. Every where was discord, and disaster. The\r\nrelations of the Madras Council, both with the naval and military\r\ncommanders, were greatly strained. Sir Eyre Coote had been obliged\r\nto return to Bengal for a time on account of his health, and Sir\r\nHector Munro, Commander-in-Chief in Madras, had resigned his command,\r\nwhile the pay of the Native Army was many months in arrears. So\r\ngreat had been the losses among the European officers, that, in\r\nspite of the stringent orders of the Court of Directors, the Madras\r\nGovernment had granted Commissions to anybody they could lay their\r\nhands on. Four naval actions had taken place off the coast during\r\nthe year, between the French fleet under Suffren and the English\r\nfleet under Hughes, without any decisive result, though the balance\r\nof advantage was with the French. Trincomalee had been captured by\r\nthe French, and the shattered English ships had no place nearer than\r\nBombay where they could refit. By land, operations had been equally\r\nunsuccessful. In February, a British detachment consisting of about\r\n100 Europeans, 1500 sepoys, 360 Cavalry, and 9 field pieces under\r\nColonel Brathwaite, was forced to surrender to a combined Mysore and\r\nFrench force, and, in April, Cuddalore yielded to the same enemy.\r\nThe operations of Sir Eyre Coote, who was at that time Commander in\r\nChief in India had not been successful. In an attempt on Arnee he was\r\noutmanœuvred by Hyder, several small reverses were experienced, and,\r\nfinally, he had fallen so seriously ill that he was forced to resign\r\nhis command, and sail for Bengal. Negapatam was attacked by Suffren\r\nand Hyder in July, and was only saved by the timely appearance of the\r\nBritish fleet. To make matters worse, famine was raging in Madras.\r\nThe country had been abandoned to the undisturbed possession of\r\nthe enemy; great numbers of natives had flocked into the town for\r\nprotection from Hyder’s Cavalry, and the ill success of our arms,\r\ntogether with scarcity of funds and bad management, prevented the\r\ncollection of adequate supplies. “Hundreds perished daily.”[6]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of October, there were only 30,000 bags of rice in\r\nthe place, the monthly consumption being 50,000. A large quantity of\r\nrice was afloat in the roads but could not be landed, owing to all\r\nthe harbour boats being taken up for the service of the fleet.[7] On\r\n15th October, a terrible storm arose: the fleet was blown off the\r\ncoast, the flag ship being so much damaged that she was kept afloat\r\nwith difficulty; several merchant ships were stranded or foundered\r\nat their anchors, and all the rice afloat was lost. “The shore for\r\nseveral miles was covered with wrecks and with the bodies of the\r\ndead and dying.”[8] Before the storm, the Admiral had declared his\r\nintention of carrying his ships round to Bombay, and had positively\r\nrefused to stop on the coast, though the absence of the fleet\r\nimperilled the safety of Madras. Some relief had been gained by the\r\nestablishment of peace with the Mahrattas, in May (treaty of Salbye),\r\nthough the final ratifications were not exchanged till February 1783:\r\nso that even in this quarter peace was not definitely secured.\r\n\r\nIt was under these depressing circumstances that the 23rd Light\r\nDragoons landed in India, not to leave it again until the British\r\narms were triumphant everywhere; a result to which the Regiment\r\ncontributed in no small degree. Their arrival gave promise that\r\nfuture successes in the field should not be so barren in results\r\nas had frequently been the case in the past. In their dispatch of\r\n31st October 1782, the Madras Government, showing their satisfaction\r\nat the arrival of the 23rd Light Dragoons, quote Sir Eyre Coote’s\r\nopinion that “a body of cavalry would have procured him the most\r\nsolid and decisive advantages over the enemy” in the earlier\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe regiment landed with a strength of 360 privates fit for duty,\r\nand, by all accounts, appears to have been a splendid lot of men.\r\nMadras letters described the troops landed as “remarkably healthy,\r\nand as fine a body of men as ever came to India ... particularly\r\nBurgoyne’s men, who, when mounted, will be as fine a body of men\r\nas ever went into the field.” A contemporary writer mentions them\r\nas “this sightly corps,” and Burgoyne himself, in the midst of his\r\ntroubles two years later, writes, “the men are now the finest you\r\ncan imagine.” Immediately after landing, firelocks were served out\r\nto the men, and a party of them were exercised in heavy gun drill.\r\nIn the course of the general mismanagement that distinguished the\r\nMadras administration at that day, the regiment was first quartered\r\nin Fort St. George, in what has been described as “a suffocating\r\nbombproof, from which three or four hundred French prisoners,\r\nafflicted with various pestilential diseases had been recently\r\nremoved. The consequences were such as might have been expected. A\r\nfatal mortality so much prevailed that no less than two or three\r\nof the men were daily sent to their graves.” In consequence of the\r\nscarcity of provisions, biscuit was issued to all the European troops\r\ninstead of rice. After a time, the regiment was moved to San Thomé,\r\nfour or five miles from Madras. The four hundred horses ordered to\r\nbe in readiness for the regiment, were not forthcoming, the few\r\nhorses available in Madras not being large enough to carry European\r\ndragoons. An application for horses had been made to Bengal, but\r\nreceived a discouraging reply. An allowance of Rs. 600 per horse was\r\ntherefore made to Sir John Burgoyne, to do his best with in mounting\r\nthe regiment. The Bengal government were ready to send horses but\r\ncould not find means of transport. In the Calcutta _Gazette_ for\r\n21st December an advertisement appears, asking owners and freighters\r\nof ships to quote rates, and state what number of horses they would\r\nconvey to Madras for government. A week later, the _Gazette_ mentions\r\nthat “Lt. Colonel Eyre’s regiment of (native) cavalry is arrived at\r\nCowgatchy from Monghyr. It is reported that this regiment is to be\r\ndismounted, and the horses sent to Madras for the European cavalry\r\nlately arrived there.” But freight for the horses was not obtained.\r\nBengal had been denuded of troops, and it was impossible to send\r\nthe horses by land without a strong escort. It was not till June\r\nfollowing that four hundred horses arrived from Bengal, by land, and\r\nthe regiment was at last complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTROUBLES AT MADRAS\r\n\r\n1783-1785\r\n\r\n  Sultan Tippoo Sahib of Mysore--Operations in Southern\r\n  India--Death of Sir Eyre Coote--Attack on Cuddalore--Peace\r\n  with France--Tippoo makes Peace--Strained relations between\r\n  civil and military in India--The E.

It brought no relief to British interests.\r\nHis son and successor, Tippoo, was an experienced soldier, though\r\ninferior to Hyder in ability. He was noted for his religious\r\nfanaticism and a violent temper, joined to a most barbarous cruelty\r\nof disposition. To this was added a spirit of implacable hostility\r\nto the English, the only European power in the country that appeared\r\nformidable to him. Possessed of a full treasury and a powerful\r\narmy, he at once took the field with a force that contained 900\r\nEuropean troops, 250 Topasses,[9] and 2000 French sepoys, besides\r\nmany thousands of his own Mysore troops. To oppose him, the Madras\r\nGovernment could dispose only of some 2950 European, and 11,500\r\nnative troops. With this force, Major General Stuart took the field\r\nin January, and made his way by slow marches to Vellore. Meanwhile,\r\nTippoo was forced to withdraw to the westward to defend Mysore from\r\nan attack on that side. On the arrival at Bombay of reinforcements in\r\nSir Richard Bickerton’s convoy, about 500 of the Company’s recruits,\r\ndestined for Madras, were detained, and, on the arrival of the King’s\r\ntroops at Madras, about 400 of them were at once sent back to Bombay.\r\nOut of this material a force had been organized, under Major General\r\nMatthews, to advance against Mysore from the west coast. After the\r\ncapture of several places, the force was hemmed in at Bednore, and\r\nobliged to surrender to Tippoo, on 30th April 1783. A great loss\r\nwas experienced at this time in the death of Sir Eyre Coote at\r\nMadras, on 27th April, three days after his return to resume command\r\nof the operations. After this nothing was done till June, when an\r\nineffective attack was made on Cuddalore by Major General Stuart.\r\nThe French were on the point of striking a counter blow which would\r\nprobably have proved successful, when the announcement of peace in\r\nEurope changed the complexion of affairs. The French force with\r\nTippoo was withdrawn, but otherwise the war continued. At this point\r\nthe Mahrattas intervened. Tippoo’s character and his great power\r\nrendered him a menace to the other native Princes, and it was no\r\npart of the Mahratta policy that he should be allowed to crush the\r\nEnglish. They therefore called on him to desist from hostilities.\r\nOn his refusing to comply, they signed a treaty of alliance against\r\nhim with the English. In the meantime, a successful expedition\r\nunder Colonel Fullarton, strengthened by the troops set free by the\r\npeace with France, had penetrated into Mysore, from the south, and\r\nthreatened Seringapatam. Under these circumstances, Lord Macartney\r\nand the Madras Council induced Tippoo to sign a treaty of peace, 11th\r\nMarch 1784; a treaty discreditable to themselves, and disapproved of\r\nby Warren Hastings.\r\n\r\nIn a letter, dated 6th September 1783, addressed to the Court of\r\nDirectors, the Select Committee of the Madras Council states that\r\nSir John Burgoyne’s regiment, being reported fit for service, had\r\nbeen ordered to take the field. But the regiment did not move\r\nfrom San Thomé. The Council desired to send the regiment into the\r\nfield without Burgoyne. On the latter notifying his intention of\r\naccompanying his regiment, under orders from General Stuart, the move\r\nwas countermanded. The incident was part of the fast ripening quarrel\r\nbetween the Civil Government and the King’s officers, which must be\r\nmentioned on account of the serious results it had on the fortunes of\r\nthe Colonel of the 23rd Light Dragoons.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of their first military establishment in India, the\r\nCompany had always evinced great distrust of their military officers,\r\na feeling that was not without some justification in view of the\r\ncharacter of the adventurers, who at first took service with the\r\nCompany. The Company’s troops on their part were under the influence\r\nof the feeling, prevalent in England, that the exercise of sovereign\r\nrights by a company of merchants was derogatory to the dignity of\r\nthe Crown. Hence it arose that the Company’s officers were less\r\ndeferential to the authority of the Company, than they should have\r\nbeen, while the Company became more exacting of the respect due to\r\nthem, and made it their policy to keep down the army, in numbers, in\r\nrank, and in authority. This feeling of jealousy became intensified\r\nwhen the services of King’s troops were placed at the disposal of the\r\nCompany; and many quarrels detrimental to the public service ensued.\r\nAt the time we are treating of, the King’s troops in India were the\r\nmainstay of the Company’s power. The Company was under stringent\r\nengagements to pay them regularly, instead of allowing their pay to\r\nfall into arrears, as was always the case with their own troops. They\r\nwere to be commanded as far as possible by King’s officers only, and\r\nthe Commander in Chief at each Presidency was appointed by the Crown.\r\nEvery King’s officer, whatever the date of his commission, took rank\r\nabove all Company’s officers holding similar commissions, and every\r\nfield officer of King’s troops, while in India, was given a step of\r\nBrevet rank above his regimental rank. This naturally caused some ill\r\nfeeling between the King’s and Company’s officers. The arrangement\r\nhad first been made when there was only a single battalion of King’s\r\ntroops in India. As the number of King’s troops increased, the extra\r\nrank given to the officers became a very serious grievance to the\r\nCompany’s officers, which was further aggravated by the Company’s\r\npolicy of maintaining a very small number of field officers, and\r\nof having their regiments commanded by Captains. The instructions\r\nfor avoiding disputes with the Company’s officers, that were issued\r\nto Sir John Burgoyne, before sailing from England, had been a\r\nstereotyped formula of orders for all officers sent with troops to\r\nIndia for more than twenty years past: but such admonitions were of\r\nlittle use under conditions that made friction inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe Madras Government was possessed at that time of a perverse\r\nspirit, that led them into all kinds of extravagancies and never\r\nending quarrels. The Members of the Council fought amongst\r\nthemselves; they evaded or disobeyed the orders of the Court of\r\nDirectors, and ignored the authority of the Governor General.\r\nIndividually, they commanded little respect. Collectively, they\r\nmismanaged everything. They interfered in military matters, that in\r\na time of war were peculiarly in the province of the chief military\r\nauthority; and they frittered away the forces at their disposal in\r\nill-conceived and badly equipped expeditions that frequently ended\r\nin disaster. Finally, they quarrelled with everybody who was not\r\nimmediately under their orders, and wrote long winded complaints to\r\nthe Court of Directors and to Bengal, instead of doing their best\r\nunder the trying circumstances of the time. The King’s officers on\r\ntheir side were also difficult to deal with. They asserted their\r\nright to direct how and where the King’s troops should be employed,\r\nand, in other respects, claimed an independence of the Civil\r\nGovernment incompatible with public interests. In 1780, when the\r\nCommander in Chief, Sir Eyre Coote, had been sent down from Bengal,\r\nafter the disaster to Colonel Baillie’s army, he was furnished with\r\norders for the suspension of the acting Governor, Mr Whitehill,\r\nagainst whom the gravest charges had been made, and he was specially\r\ninvested with powers that to a great extent made him independent\r\nof the Madras Council, including the exclusive direction of the\r\ntreasure transmitted for the prosecution of the war. The temporary\r\ngrant of such powers was necessary under existing circumstances, but\r\nwas none the less resented by the Madras Council; though there was\r\nlittle active opposition till the assumption of the Governorship by\r\nLord Macartney in June 1781. The Council complained that more was\r\nnot accomplished, Sir Eyre Coote complained that his troops were\r\nsent into the field without supplies; the Council sent an expedition\r\nagainst the Dutch settlements, without consulting the General, and an\r\nopen rupture occurred, in which the Admiral took part, in consequence\r\nof dispatches addressed to both Commanders being opened by the\r\nResident at Tanjore. At this stage of the quarrel, Sir Eyre Coote’s\r\nhealth forced him to leave for Bengal. The command devolved on Major\r\nGeneral Stuart, and the quarrel went on worse than ever.\r\n\r\nLord Macartney at once assumed the direction of the campaign, and\r\nmade himself ridiculous by forcing Stuart to destroy three of his\r\nown forts, the preservation of which was anxiously desired by Sir\r\nEyre Coote. Stuart, on his side, claimed the right of exercising the\r\nspecial powers that had been conferred on Sir Eyre Coote. Stuart’s\r\nposition was a peculiar one. While on the King’s half pay list, in\r\n1775, his services were lent to the Company, who conferred on him the\r\nrank of Brigadier General. In October 1781, the Crown gave him the\r\ncommission of Major General in India, and, three months later, his\r\ncommission was antedated. His position, however, differed from that\r\nof other General Officers, in that he was not borne on the strength\r\nof any regiment, and his status in England was only that of a half\r\npay Colonel. He had done good service already in the campaign against\r\nHyder, in which he had lost a leg by a cannon shot.\r\n\r\nIn December 1782, Stuart withdrew the garrison of Masulipatam for\r\nservice elsewhere, without consulting the Government, and at once\r\nboth parties entered into a paper war, that absorbed all the energies\r\nthat should have been devoted to the war with Tippoo and the French.\r\nEach party bombarded the other with notes and minutes, that continued\r\nto be exchanged after the army had taken the field for Cuddalore,\r\nand the Council wrote to London and Calcutta in the gloomiest terms,\r\nexpressing their fears of General Stuart’s designs.[10] In neither\r\nquarter did they elicit any sympathy. In terms of measured sarcasm\r\nWarren Hastings pointed out that their “collected mass of complaint\r\nand invective” was directed in turn against every single British\r\nauthority in India except themselves, including the Naval Commander\r\nin Chief, as well as against the Nawab of Arcot and his ministers.\r\n\r\nThe Madras Government had become contemptible alike in the eyes of\r\nfriends and enemies, and it was impossible to work with them. Lost\r\nto all sense of public duty, they formed the project of refusing\r\nto place the troops under command of Sir Eyre Coote on his return\r\nin April. Sir Eyre Coote was, on this occasion, nominated by the\r\nBengal Government to take the command of all the troops on the Coast,\r\nexcept the garrison actually required at Madras. Not an unreasonable\r\narrangement, as Sir Eyre Coote was Commander in Chief in India, and\r\nthe Madras Government was dependent for money on Bengal. The Madras\r\nGovernment sent peremptory orders for Stuart to hasten his march,\r\nin order that the troops might be far distant when Sir E. Coote\r\narrived, and passed a resolution that he should not have the command.\r\nA letter addressed by the Madras Council to Sir Eyre Coote when he\r\nwas dying, drew down upon them a censure from Warren Hastings that\r\nwas calculated to penetrate the most pachydermatous self-conceit,\r\nbut it had apparently no effect on Lord Macartney and his Council.\r\nEven before Sir Eyre Coote’s death, the feeling of Lord Macartney and\r\nthe Council against the King’s officers was shown by a minute of the\r\nCouncil, at the time of the preparation of the army for the siege\r\nof Cuddalore, wherein an attempt was made to deprive the Generals\r\nbearing the King’s commission of any employment in the field. In it,\r\nan endeavour was made to elicit from Major General Stuart an opinion\r\nthat the public interests would be best served by leaving those\r\nofficers, five in number, in garrison. This idea was resisted by\r\nStuart, and Major General Bruce was sent with the army to Cuddalore.\r\nThe frigate that conveyed the news of the cessation of hostilities\r\nwith France, to the army before Cuddalore, brought also peremptory\r\norders to Stuart to embark at once for Madras, to answer charges of\r\nmisconduct. Bruce was forced by ill health to return a few days later.\r\n\r\nThe command of the force in the field then devolved temporarily on\r\nColonel Gordon, till Sir John Burgoyne took command of the returning\r\narmy on 13th August. But Sir John Burgoyne had likewise come under\r\nthe displeasure of the Select Committee. In the same letter[11] to\r\nthe Court of Directors in which they announced the supersession of\r\nStuart, and their intention to give the command to Burgoyne, they\r\nwrote--\r\n\r\n  “Sir John Burgoyne expecting a Preference to be given to his men\r\n  in point of accommodations and every other respect above all\r\n  other Corps of His Majesty’s or the Company’s troops, and making\r\n  no allowance for the calamities of the times and the Exigencies\r\n  of our situation, has been loud and frequent in his complaints,\r\n  and the utmost endeavours on our Part to show attention to\r\n  himself as well as to his Regiment have fallen short of the sense\r\n  he entertained of the claims of both.”\r\n\r\nIn another part of the same letter they stated that Burgoyne had\r\nclaimed to be a Major General, but they had only his word for it, as\r\nthe fact had not been notified to them. Yet, in the Directors’ letter\r\nof 25th January 1782, Burgoyne’s rank as Major General in the East\r\nIndies from 1st June 1781, is precisely stated.\r\n\r\nBurgoyne was justifiably angry at the treatment his regiment had\r\nexperienced. Nothing had been done by the Madras Government to\r\nhave horses in readiness for the regiment on arrival. The quarters\r\nin which the men were first placed were so unhealthy, that by the\r\nmiddle of July, less than nine months after landing, 78 had died.\r\nHis own claims to the rank and allowances of a Major General were\r\nchallenged; while, in common with all the senior officers of King’s\r\ntroops, he was exasperated by the animus displayed against them by\r\nLord Macartney and the Council, and the openly avowed intention to\r\nignore their just claims, in defiance of the intentions of the Crown.\r\nIn a letter, dated 3rd September 1783, in which he reports to the\r\nMinistry at home, the fact of his having assumed the command of the\r\narmy returning from Cuddalore, he dwells on the grievances of the\r\nKing’s General officers, especially “the declaration of the Governor,\r\nwho says no King’s officer shall ever Command in Chief here, let\r\nhis rank be what it may; and that a junior officer in the Company’s\r\nservice should have rank given him superior to what any King’s\r\nofficer may have to entitle him to command.” It is evident that the\r\nviolent measures shortly afterwards taken by Lord Macartney, were in\r\npursuance of a long contemplated scheme for getting rid of the King’s\r\nGeneral officers.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Stuart had been quarrelsome and unreasonable in\r\nhis dealings with the rest of the Council. The Council complained\r\nloudly of the slowness of his advance on Cuddalore. For this he does\r\nnot appear to have been responsible, as the delay was caused by\r\nhis having to wait for the squadron and store ships which did not\r\narrive before Cuddalore till after the army had encamped before the\r\nplace. Among other causes of quarrel was the desire of the General\r\nto give effect to the views of the Bengal Government in the affairs\r\nof the Nawab of Arcot; views which were strenuously opposed by the\r\nrest of the Council. Soon after the return of the army to Madras\r\nthe Council passed a resolution dismissing Stuart from the service,\r\nand conferring the Commander in Chiefship on Burgoyne. On the 17th\r\nSeptember this was announced to Burgoyne, who was addressed as\r\nCommander in Chief, and requested to attend the Council immediately.\r\nIn a General order of the same date, the Council, anticipating\r\nobjections, justified their action by arguing that Stuart held only a\r\nhalf pay commission from the King, and that the Company could do as\r\nthey pleased with him as he held no position under the Crown in India.\r\n\r\nAs Burgoyne entered the Fort a salute was fired from the ramparts,\r\nbut he at once informed the Council that, while they could dispose\r\nof the command of the Company’s forces as they pleased, he had no\r\npower to supersede Stuart who held the King’s commission of Major\r\nGeneral, and the command of the King’s troops _de jure_, and, so\r\nlong as he was able to act, could only be deprived of his command by\r\nthe King’s order. On this he was told that, if he did not accept the\r\ncommand, it was intended to make Lieutenant Colonel Lang a Company’s\r\nofficer, a Lieutenant General, and appoint him Commander-in-Chief.\r\nBurgoyne continued firm in his resolve, but was detained till 8 in\r\nthe evening on various pretexts. Meanwhile, without his knowledge,\r\narrangements were made for Stuart’s arrest, and a letter was sent to\r\nLieutenant Colonel Lang appointing him Commander-in-Chief of the army\r\nwith the rank of Lieutenant General. The order issued a few hours\r\npreviously, appointing Burgoyne Commander-in-Chief, was ignored as if\r\nit had never existed. Burgoyne was then told that he might retire.\r\nOn leaving the Council room, he found the gates closed and the\r\ndrawbridges drawn up, and learned that Stuart had been arrested by a\r\ncompany of sepoys, in his own house, and brought, a close prisoner,\r\ninto the Fort, under circumstances of much indignity. The excuse\r\nafterwards assigned by the Select Committee for this extraordinary\r\nproceeding was, that they believed Stuart was about to seize the\r\nGovernment by force.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Burgoyne wrote to the Select Committee,\r\nexpressing his intention of taking command of the King’s troops,\r\nsince Stuart was incapacitated from acting. He received no reply,\r\nand, on arrival at the camp he found two orders, one constituting\r\nLang a Lieutenant General, and the other directing Lang to take\r\ncommand of the whole army; thus superseding Burgoyne and four other\r\nMajor Generals and several Lieutenant Colonels, who had been senior\r\nto Lang.\r\n\r\nBurgoyne at once assembled the King’s Officers in his tent, and\r\nrelated to them what had passed. For his own part, he said, he\r\nshould consider himself wanting in his duty, to pay obedience to\r\nany other than a senior officer of the King’s appointment: that\r\nGeneral Stuart being deprived of the possibility of acting, the\r\ncommand of the King’s troops devolved on himself. He did not\r\nattempt to bias the opinions of any of the gentlemen present: he\r\nrecommended the avoidance of altercation or even discussion with the\r\nCompany’s officers, lest unforeseen consequences might ensue. The\r\nofficers present said they would obey no orders but those of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief representing the King, viz.: Sir John Burgoyne.\r\n\r\nThe same afternoon Lang arrived in camp, and met the King’s officers\r\nin Burgoyne’s tent, where he delivered an order from the Council\r\ninstructing Burgoyne to surrender the command of the Army to him.\r\nBurgoyne replied that he would give over the command of the Company’s\r\ntroops to whomsoever the Council chose to appoint, but that his duty\r\nto the King required that he should not deliver over the command\r\nof the King’s troops to any person not regularly authorized by His\r\nMajesty: he placed his tents at Colonel Lang’s service. Lang replied\r\nthat he had a house at the Mount, and remained silent some time,\r\ntill, on the officers calling out that they would obey Sir John\r\nBurgoyne only, he got up and went away. On the same day a letter\r\nwas addressed to the Admiral by Sir John, asking for advice and\r\nsupport, and requesting an asylum on board the flag ship, in the\r\nevent of any attempt being made on his person. The Admiral was so\r\nsituated that he might have discreetly acted as mediator between\r\nthe contending parties had he been so disposed; but, perhaps, his\r\nprevious experiences of the Madras Council made him unwilling to be\r\nmixed up in the quarrel. Anyhow, he refused to have anything to do\r\nwith the matter.\r\n\r\nVery little was needed to produce a conflict between the King’s and\r\nCompany’s troops that night. The King’s troops had been exasperated\r\nat the animosity displayed by the Council towards Sir Eyre Coote and\r\nthe King’s officers in general. They were alarmed at the violence\r\noffered to General Stuart, and were resolved to repel by force any\r\nrepetition of this violence in Burgoyne’s case. In order to prevent\r\nsurprise, guards were posted round the Camp. The Council, on their\r\npart, had been haunted all along by the idea that the King’s Officers\r\naimed at subverting the Government. Two battalions of Bengal Sepoys\r\nwith some guns were ordered down to protect Lang’s house, and the\r\ngates of the Fort were kept shut. Each party expected to be attacked,\r\nand, for the next forty-eight hours, a very slight occurrence might\r\nhave precipitated a disastrous conflict.\r\n\r\nThe following day, Burgoyne summoned Major Generals Bruce, Campbell,\r\nOgle, and Adams to confer with him, and a remonstrance, signed by\r\nthe five, was drawn up and forwarded to the Council; to the effect\r\nthat they were determined not to act under Lang’s orders. Lang had\r\nmeanwhile issued orders for the Army to march on the following day,\r\nin order to test their obedience. Lieut. Colonel Floyd was also\r\nsenior to Lang by the date of his commission. Several regiments gave\r\nassurances of support to Burgoyne and Floyd. At a conference of the\r\nsenior officers a course of action was determined on, and Burgoyne\r\nwithdrew from the camp, at midnight, to his house in Madras. The\r\nvedettes round the camp were at once withdrawn. The next morning,\r\nFloyd likewise withdrew from the army; handing over his command to\r\nLt. Colonel Mackenzie of the 73rd, who was junior to Lang by date of\r\ncommission. The force marched, and took up fresh ground in rear of\r\ntheir former position.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Madras, Burgoyne addressed a letter to the Select\r\nCommittee notifying his withdrawal from the camp, and offering\r\nhimself for arrest if Government had a mind to seize his person. The\r\noffer was somewhat embarrassing to the Select Committee, who evaded\r\nthe point by saying that, as Burgoyne had refused to take command of\r\nthe Army, Lang had been appointed in his place, and there was nothing\r\nmore to be said in the matter. On this, Burgoyne deputed Floyd to\r\ncarry a letter to Lord Macartney, in which he asserted his position\r\nas senior officer bearing the King’s commission, and pointed out that\r\nhe alone had power to convene Courts Martial.[12]\r\n\r\nLord Macartney was a man of violent temper and overbearing\r\ndisposition that kept him in continual hot water. He demanded\r\nunhesitating submission to his views from all with whom he came in\r\ncontact. His relations with the supreme government at Calcutta were\r\nas unyielding as with those in immediate contact with him at Madras.\r\nHis chief merit was his personal honesty in money matters, at a time\r\nof great laxity; a merit on which he was by no means silent, and\r\nwhich he did not insist on in his colleagues. He threw himself with\r\nardour into the chronic quarrels carried on by the Madras Council\r\nwith the Bengal Government and the military authorities, and, in\r\npursuit of the quarrels, lost sight of the great interests at stake,\r\nand brought the Madras settlement to the verge of anarchy. Even\r\nbefore Sir Eyre Coote’s death he had been induced to believe that\r\nGeneral Stuart had designs against the Government. This belief, for\r\nwhich not a scrap of evidence was ever brought forward, led him into\r\na line of conduct that brought about corresponding and increasing\r\nopposition from Stuart. After Stuart’s arrest, the same suspicion\r\nwas transferred to Burgoyne, with even less presumption of justice\r\nthan had existed in Stuart’s case. Burgoyne proposed an interview\r\nin the presence of witnesses. Had Lord Macartney been less bent on\r\nthe quarrel, he would have grasped the opportunity of coming to\r\nsome understanding. Instead of this he used the most uncompromising\r\nlanguage to Floyd. “Government would not recede; Government must\r\nbe peremptory;” and he still affected to treat Burgoyne as having\r\nrefused the command of the army. The following day, Burgoyne received\r\na letter from the Select Committee arguing the old point of General\r\nStuart’s commission, and asserting that Burgoyne had acknowledged the\r\nvalidity of Lang’s promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General, in\r\nspite of which he had withdrawn from camp without Lang’s permission.\r\nThe Committee would not contest with him about any authority he\r\nmight undertake to exercise, unless it endangered the public safety,\r\nbut would not countenance his resumption of command. Lang’s command\r\nextended to the King’s as well as the Company’s troops, and they (the\r\nCommittee) would convey dispatches addressed to either Commander\r\nin Chief, to Lang. If Sir John Burgoyne thought proper to act as\r\nCommander in Chief, and to convene Courts Martial, the Committee\r\nhad no objection “unless their duty forced them to interfere.” Such\r\nunworkable arrangements were bound to lead to further quarrels.\r\nOn the same day, as previously proposed by him, Sir John Burgoyne\r\nhad an interview with Lord Macartney, Major General Bruce and Lt.\r\nColonel Floyd being present. Throughout the quarrel, Burgoyne had\r\nbeen actuated by a desire to arrive at some working arrangement that\r\nwould enable the public service to be carried on, while preserving\r\nthe rights of the King whose senior representative he was. In this\r\nspirit he sought an interview with the Governor. But there was no\r\ncorresponding desire for peace on the side of the Governor and\r\nCouncil, and Lord Macartney’s behaviour was disingenuous. Burgoyne\r\nasked for explanations to some parts of the Select Committee’s\r\nletter, which he discussed generally. Lord Macartney would give no\r\ndirect answer, and was very guarded in what he said. He was only a\r\nMember of the Government, not authorized to decide, but only to speak\r\ntheir sentiments, and to represent matters to the other Members.\r\nWould Sir John put down in writing what questions he pleased, he\r\nwould engage to lay them before the Select Committee, and obtain\r\nreplies to them. Lord Macartney’s intention was to obtain the same\r\ncontrol over the King’s troops, as he exercised over the Company’s\r\ntroops. To gain this end he was resolved to give the command to a\r\nCompany’s officer, who would naturally be more pliable than a King’s\r\nofficer, though it was a recognised principle with the British\r\nGovernment to keep the command of the King’s troops under an officer\r\nof their own appointment. It is almost incredible that this miserable\r\nquarrel should have gone on at a time of the greatest public\r\ndistress, when Tippoo was triumphant in the field, and it was still\r\nuncertain that the Mahrattas would not take up arms again.\r\n\r\nStuart was, shortly afterwards, shipped off to England under close\r\narrest, in a ship specially purchased for the purpose, though, for\r\nwant of funds, the pay of the troops was in some instances over two\r\nyears in arrears. During imprisonment, he was denied the use of pen\r\nand ink, and was only allowed to see Burgoyne on public business\r\nin presence of the officer on duty over him. At the time of his\r\nembarkation, he believed that it was intended to put him to death at\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nBurgoyne assumed the command of the King’s troops without further\r\ndirect opposition, but the Council lost no opportunity of thwarting\r\nhim and lowering his authority, while they encouraged others to\r\nresist it. Burgoyne, on his part, cast moderation aside, and was\r\nbent on pushing his claims to extremity. He ignored General Lang,\r\nand issued orders that clashed with those of the civil government,\r\nproducing confusion, perplexity, and relaxation of discipline in\r\nevery rank. The Major Generals, who had joined in signing the\r\nprotest against Lang’s promotion, and several others among the\r\nofficers commanding regiments withdrew their support from Burgoyne.\r\nIn October, Burgoyne placed Lieutenant Colonel Sterling of the\r\n36th under arrest for disobedience of orders: the Select Committee\r\nreleased him. The soldiers too had their grievances about batta which\r\nshould have been paid to them, but was withheld by Lord Macartney.\r\nThe men of the 98th were on the eve of mutiny, and the men of\r\nBurgoyne’s own regiment formed the project of going to the Fort in a\r\nbody to ask redress. Burgoyne sternly repressed both movements, but\r\nthe Select Committee gave him credit for causing them. A fresh crisis\r\nin the quarrel was inevitable.\r\n\r\nIn December, General Ogle reported certain matters seriously\r\naffecting the private character of an officer of the 73rd. The rest\r\nof the officers of the regiment refused to allow the matter to be\r\npatched up, as General Ogle desired. Burgoyne had no option but to\r\nconvene a General Court Martial, which he did, appointing Lieutenant\r\nColonel Straubenzee of the 52nd as President. The Court was also\r\nto try two soldiers of the 98th, who had appealed from a Regimental\r\nCourt Martial. On such occasions it was customary for the Council to\r\nappoint the Judge Advocate. They refused to nominate one for this or\r\nany Court Martial Sir John might order to assemble, and refused to\r\ngrant a place in the Fort for the Court to assemble in. They also\r\nforbade Straubenzee to leave Poonamallee where he was commanding.\r\nBurgoyne then arranged for the Court to assemble at Poonamallee,\r\nbut without making the change known, and ordered Straubenzee still\r\nto hold himself in readiness to preside. He also ordered Colonel\r\nSterling to appear for trial before the Court. The Select Committee\r\nthereupon, on the 31st December, issued an order placing Burgoyne\r\nunder arrest for disobedience of orders in September, and for\r\nexciting mutiny and sedition, and appointed Major General Alan\r\nCampbell to command the King’s troops. No attempt was made on this\r\noccasion to place the King’s troops under Lang.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity of the Select Committee’s action, both in Stuart’s\r\nand Burgoyne’s cases, was shown by their inability to form a Court\r\nMartial for the trial of those officers. They tried to get Burgoyne\r\nto proceed to England, but he refused to go. He proceeded, for a\r\ntime, to Pondicherry under open arrest, while the dual commands of\r\nthe King’s and Company’s forces continued. For the next eighteen\r\nmonths Lord Macartney’s quarrels and intrigues, added to his unjust\r\nmeasures touching the pay and allowances of the army, produced\r\nresults that bid fair to end in the ruin of the British government on\r\nthe Coast.\r\n\r\nIn April 1784, a mutiny occurred among four newly formed Native\r\nCavalry Regiments at Arnee. Arrears of pay for twelve months were\r\nowing to them, and they likewise had unsatisfied claims on the Nawab\r\nof Arcot, from whose service they had been transferred. They seized\r\nthe fort of Arnee, and imprisoned their officers. A month’s pay\r\nwas given them, but they held out for the whole arrears. The 36th\r\nFoot and one hundred men of the 23rd Light Dragoons were dispatched\r\nto Arcot, to join General Lang. On the night of the 15th May they\r\nmarched for Arnee, which they reached soon after daybreak, and after\r\na brief parley the mutineers laid down their arms.[13] In October,\r\none of the King’s infantry regiments at Arcot broke out into open\r\nmutiny, but were overawed by the men of the 23rd, and the two other\r\nregiments in garrison, who stuck to their officers. These were by no\r\nmeans the only instances of grave insubordination both among King’s\r\nor Company’s troops, due to Lord Macartney’s ill-advised measures.\r\nThe officers had to complain of broken faith as well as the men.\r\n\r\nSir John Burgoyne’s arrest did not prevent him from looking after\r\nthe welfare of the regiment. There had been many casualties among\r\nthe horses,[14] as well as among the men; and Lord Macartney is said\r\nto have conceived the idea of gradually allowing the 23rd Light\r\nDragoons to disappear from want of horses and men, and of raising\r\na corps of European cavalry in their place. As the men died, the\r\nextra horses were taken from the regiment, and Lt. Colonel Floyd\r\nwas forbidden to entertain recruits, of whom a certain number were\r\nprocurable, probably from Infantry regiments on the spot. Sir John\r\nthereupon addressed the Bengal Government, by whom a reference was\r\nmade to Madras recommending the deficiencies to be made good. The\r\nMadras Government thought the regiment was very well as it was, and\r\ndemurred to corresponding with Sir John while he was under arrest.\r\nThe Bengal Govt. pointed out that that need not prevent them from\r\ncorresponding with the next officer in the regiment. They dwelt on\r\nthe importance of maintaining the regiment in an efficient state, and\r\nexpressed their sense of the value of the services rendered by the\r\nRegiment in dealing with the Mutiny of the Native Cavalry at Arnee,\r\nand their “desire of giving the Company’s service the full benefit\r\nof the good discipline of H.M.’s 23rd Light Dragoons.” The Madras\r\nGovernment replied that they would be glad if the Bengal Govt. would\r\ntake over the whole of the charges of the regiment. For their part,\r\nthey thought it useless to recruit for the regiment, when there were\r\nalready more men than horses, and it would be better to transfer\r\nthe superfluous men to the Infantry, as horses were expensive, and\r\na diminution in their number was a useful economy. Warren Hastings\r\nbrushed all such cobwebs aside, and sent 147 horses from Hyderabad\r\nto remount the regiment. In spite of their protests, the Madras\r\nGovernment entered into a correspondence with Sir John which was\r\ncharacterized on both sides by much bitterness. A detachment of the\r\nregiment was at this time at Ellore in the Masulipatum district.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been some expectation at this time that the\r\nregiment would be recalled to England, probably on account of Lord\r\nMacartney’s recommendations to the Court of Directors. Anyhow, a\r\nMadras letter, dated 26th May 1785, published in the _Calcutta Public\r\nAdvertiser_, says: “The 23rd Regiment is to remain in India. The\r\nappointments and recommendations of Sir John Burgoyne, are approved\r\nof.” In the middle of July, a detachment of the regiment was sent to\r\nArcot, but was almost immediately recalled to San Thomé.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sir John Burgoyne’s troubles were coming to an end. On\r\nthe news of the quarrels, resulting in Burgoyne’s arrest, reaching\r\nEngland, much interest was excited in the highest quarters. The\r\nmatter was twice discussed in the House of Commons, on the 19th July\r\nand 9th August, and it was generally recognised that the trouble had\r\nprimarily arisen from a faulty system. Burgoyne was held to have\r\nbeen correct in his behaviour, and received reassuring letters,\r\nwritten by the King’s commands, pending the official settlement of\r\nthe question. It was determined to appoint at once a new Commander in\r\nChief of Madras, besides filling the vacancy caused by the death of\r\nSir Eyre Coote, and to remove the chief actors in the quarrel on both\r\nsides. Burgoyne continued under arrest till the nearly simultaneous\r\narrival in Madras, at the beginning of June, of Lieut. General Robert\r\nSloper as Commander in Chief in India, and Lieut. General Sir John\r\nDalling as Commander in Chief in Madras. General Sloper brought with\r\nhim instructions to convene a Court Martial for Burgoyne’s trial,\r\nand for Burgoyne’s return to England after the trial, whatever its\r\nresult might be. Lord Macartney, at the same time, received orders\r\nfor the surrender of the assignment to the Nawab of Arcot, and\r\nprivate intelligence of the appointment of his successor. He had\r\nbeen severely wounded, a few months before, in a duel with one of\r\nthe Council, due to his own overbearing temper, and his health was\r\nbad. Believing that he was about to be recalled, he resigned his\r\npost, and sailed for Calcutta to confer with the Bengal Government\r\nbefore sailing for Europe. While in Calcutta, he received news of\r\nhis appointment to succeed Warren Hastings; but his health would not\r\npermit him to stop in India, and he sailed for England.[15]\r\n\r\nGeneral Sloper appointed a Court Martial on Burgoyne, with Sir\r\nJohn Dalling as President. The Madras Council at once claimed the\r\nright to appoint the Prosecutor, which being disallowed, they wrote\r\ncomplaints in their usual style to the Court of Directors. Another\r\ngrievance with the Council was, that they were not given a copy of\r\nthe Proceedings. Their desire apparently was to prosecute the quarrel\r\nthrough Lord Macartney in England. The wish of the Government in\r\nEngland, and of the Court of Directors, was to bury the unseemly\r\nquarrel as speedily as possible, and the Proceedings were withheld.\r\nA year and a half later, the Madras Government were still writing to\r\nthe Governor General for a copy. The exact charges, of which there\r\nwere nineteen, cannot now be ascertained, but they partially related\r\nto Sir John Burgoyne’s behaviour in September 1783, more than three\r\nmonths before the date of his arrest, and charged him with causing\r\nand exciting mutiny and sedition, and refusing to take command of the\r\nKing’s troops. On the 11th July, after sitting for nineteen days, the\r\nCourt came to the following resolutions--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1st.]\r\n\r\n  That Major General Sir John Burgoyne did not refuse to take upon\r\n  him the command of the King’s troops after Major General Stuart\r\n  was put under an arrest; but that he declined superseding that\r\n  Major General, so long as he viewed him especially appointed by\r\n  the King, and he remained in the capacity of acting as such.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2nd.]\r\n\r\n  That the line of conduct pursued by Major General Sir John\r\n  Burgoyne on the 19th September and quitting camp the eve of that\r\n  day, was productive of the happiest consequences.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 3rd.]\r\n\r\n  That in no instance whatsoever did Major General Sir John\r\n  Burgoyne disobey any orders immediately proceeding from the\r\n  Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 4th.]\r\n\r\n  That the equivocal situation of Lieut. General Lang, from his\r\n  standing in both services,[16] and this Government having\r\n  at present no charter rights to confer such high ranks, well\r\n  warranted his Majesty’s general officers in witholding from him\r\n  their obedience.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 5th.]\r\n\r\n  That the orders sent to Lieut. Colonel Sterling by Major\r\n  General Sir John Burgoyne, seem to be solely for promoting good\r\n  discipline in his Majesty’s troops, and to respect only their\r\n  internal economy, which, as the King’s Commander in Chief, he had\r\n  not only a right to give, but enforce also.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 6th.]\r\n\r\n  That in the instance for which Major General Sir John Burgoyne\r\n  was originally put in arrest, it appears the government acted\r\n  from half information, not having before them the postscript to\r\n  the General Orders of Major General Sir John Burgoyne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 7th.]\r\n\r\n  That the letters before the Court from Major General Sir John\r\n  Burgoyne to Lord Macartney or the Presidency, so far from being\r\n  mutinous or seditious, are not even disrespectful. The facts\r\n  which they assert are strong; but in the manner and expression\r\n  they are as decent and proper as the circumstances which gave\r\n  them birth could reasonably admit.\r\n\r\n  SENTENCE.\r\n\r\n  The Court having thus maturely considered of the evidence and\r\n  records in support of the prosecution, and likewise the defence\r\n  and those in support of it, is of opinion that the Prisoner Major\r\n  General Sir John Burgoyne Bart. is not guilty of the charges\r\n  alledged against him; and doth therefore most fully and honorably\r\n  acquit him of all and every part of the same.[17]\r\n\r\n  (Signed)\r\n\r\n      JOHN DALLING,\r\n\r\n      Lieut. General & President.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the close of the proceedings, the Council addressed\r\nBurgoyne in peremptory and discourteous terms, desiring him to\r\nleave the country; and there appeared every chance of a fresh\r\nquarrel arising, when some influence (probably Sir John Dalling’s)\r\nintervened, and thenceforward there was peace. Burgoyne’s claims\r\nfor arrears of pay and allowances, for himself as Commander in\r\nChief, his Aide-de-camp, and his secretary, for the period he had\r\nbeen under arrest, were admitted; his passage money was advanced to\r\nhim, and he was preparing to sail, when death overtook him on the\r\n23rd of September at the age of forty-six. A tablet to his memory\r\nwas placed in St. Mary’s Church in the Fort, by the officers of the\r\nKing’s troops. Lang was withdrawn from the service by the Court\r\nof Directors who granted him a special pension of one thousand a\r\nyear. Stuart, a few years later, was given the Colonelcy of H.M.’s\r\n31st. In consequence of these disputes, the offices of Governor and\r\nCommander-in-Chief were, soon after, vested in the same person, in\r\neach of the Presidencies. In order to prevent a recurrence of the\r\ndispute in General Sloper’s case, it was ordered, at the time of his\r\nappointment, that in the event of the Company ceasing to employ him,\r\nhis right to command the King’s troops should also cease. A project\r\nfor amalgamating the King’s and Company’s forces in India, in order\r\nto put an end to the rivalry between the two services, was seriously\r\nconsidered two years later, but the only change made was to put an\r\nend to the supersession of the Company’s by the King’s officers.\r\n\r\nIn studying the details of this unhappy quarrel, the conviction\r\nforces itself upon one that there were persons in the background,\r\nwho, for their own purposes, fomented the dispute, and aggravated\r\nthe differences between the principal parties, by filling their\r\nminds with suspicions and ideas that were equally groundless and\r\nmischievous. This is plainly stated to have been the case by\r\nan officer of the 73rd Highlanders who published a Narrative of\r\nthe war with Hyder. “Had it not been for the cordiality and good\r\nfellowship which universally subsisted betwixt the King’s and\r\nCompany’s officers, who had shared the fatigues of war together,\r\nnotwithstanding the artful steps that had been taken to sow the seeds\r\nof dissension amongst them, these broils might have terminated in\r\na manner very fatal to the settlement.”[18] Long afterwards, Lord\r\nMacartney acknowledged his mistake. In December 1797, speaking to Sir\r\nDavid Baird, he said, “Had I known as much of you military gentlemen,\r\nwhen I was in India, as I have learned since, we never should have\r\nhad any difference.” Sir John Burgoyne’s justification was complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCHANGE OF NUMBER\r\n\r\n1786-1789\r\n\r\n  Regiment moved to Shevtamodoo--John Floyd--Number of regiment\r\n  changed to 19th--Uniform--Sir William Howe appointed\r\n  Colonel--Foundation of Indian native cavalry system laid by Floyd\r\n  and the 19th Light Dragoons.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of Sir John Dalling, after composing the\r\nquarrels between the Civil Government and the King’s troops in\r\nMadras, was to draw up a scheme for brigading the troops in\r\nCantonments. The scheme never took shape, beyond the formation of a\r\nlarge Cantonment, in February 1786, at Wallajabad, near Conjeveram,\r\nabout fifty miles from Madras. Among the troops detailed for the new\r\nCantonment were the 23rd Light Dragoons. Before leaving their\r\nquarters at San Thomé, they were reviewed by the Commander-in-Chief.\r\nBeing the only English Cavalry regiment in the country, the review\r\nattracted some attention, and the following account was published in\r\nthe _Madras Courier_ for 29th March 1786.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n_Lieut: General Sir John Floyd Bart._\r\n\r\n_from a portrait believed to be by A. W. Devis._\r\n\r\n  _Walker & Boutall ph. sc._]\r\n\r\n  “The review of the 23rd Dragoons on Saturday last, was far\r\n  superior to any expectation that had been formed of it, displayed\r\n  the most brilliant military exhibition that has ever been seen\r\n  in India, and it is presumed, equal to any that has taken place\r\n  at anytime in Europe. It reflects the highest honour on the\r\n  Commanding Officer, whose great military knowledge, joined\r\n  to indefatigable exertions, has brought the regiment to that\r\n  degree of perfection which, while it pleases and astonishes,\r\n  teaches the very useful, though long doubted lesson, that men\r\n  can be disciplined, and horses trained in this country equally\r\n  as well as in Europe. The most particularly striking manœuvre\r\n  was a charge at full speed for near three hundred yards in\r\n  a perfect line; and that of two squadrons dispersing, and\r\n  pursuing, supported by the regiment; these were performed with\r\n  the exactness of mechanical precision, and produced the most\r\n  beautiful effect; but what is very extraordinary the horses were\r\n  all perfectly obedient, and scarcely a single accoutrement of the\r\n  riders was discomposed.\r\n\r\n  “A Correspondent observes, that too much praise cannot be given\r\n  to the 23rd dragoons, for the excellent manner in which they\r\n  performed their manœuvres, at the review on Saturday last; that\r\n  the men were in the highest perfection of discipline; and that\r\n  the officers, the finest body belonging to any one corps that\r\n  he recollects to have seen, were so perfectly masters of every\r\n  manœuvre, and led each motion with so much judgment, that it were\r\n  impossible for any troops under them to make a single mistake.”\r\n\r\nThe 23rd Light Dragoons were not cantoned at Wallajabad, but Floyd\r\nwas directed to select a spot within a certain indicated area. He\r\nfixed on Shevtamodoo, about two miles from Conjeveram, and nine miles\r\nfrom Wallajabad.\r\n\r\n  “The spot is extremely beautiful, exceeding anything I have met\r\n  with in India, except among the hills. My barracks are building\r\n  something within the edge of an open grove of immense tamarinds.\r\n  The Officers’ barracks are within the grove. A plain extends\r\n  about half a mile in front, and something less in breadth along\r\n  the north bank of the river Paliar, above the ordinary level of\r\n  the country, with a large lake on the other side of the ground\r\n  towards its extremity, with a small woody island in it skirting\r\n  the whole plain. The plain is sprinkled by nature’s masterly hand\r\n  with enormous banyan trees, far exceeding the size of the very\r\n  largest trees known in Europe. My own barracks will stand at some\r\n  distance, nearly in the middle of the plain, under the largest of\r\n  these extraordinary trees.”[19]\r\n\r\nIt was here that Floyd laid the foundation of that excellence in\r\ndiscipline and efficiency, that fitted the regiment to play the\r\ndistinguished part it was destined in after years to fill, with such\r\nsuccess, in the stirring affairs of southern India. This will be a\r\nsuitable place to give some account of this distinguished soldier.\r\n\r\nJohn Floyd, born in 1748, was the son of an officer in the 1st\r\nDragoon Guards who served at Minden, and died in Germany six weeks\r\nafter the battle. In recognition of his father’s services, John Floyd\r\nwas given a commission in the 15th (Elliott’s) Light Dragoons, in\r\nthe year after the regiment was raised, and was present with it at\r\nthe battle of Emsdorf, on the 16th July 1760, when only twelve years\r\nold. There he had his horse shot under him, while charging the French\r\nranks, and was only saved by a brother officer who cut down his\r\nassailant. The sword of the French hussar is still preserved in the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe 15th Light Dragoons under Sir John Elliott and Lord Pembroke were\r\nregarded at that time as the school for British Light Cavalry. Lord\r\nPembroke had made a special study of military equitation, concerning\r\nwhich he had written a book,[20] that went through several editions,\r\nand was a recognized text book on military riding. He interested\r\nhimself in Floyd, and took pains to give him a complete education,\r\nand made him a proficient horseman. Later, on Lord Pembroke obtaining\r\nthe command of the Royal Dragoons, he employed Floyd for twelve\r\nmonths in teaching his system to that regiment. In 1777-78-79, Floyd,\r\nunder Lord Pembroke’s auspices, visited nearly every Court in Europe,\r\nand reported on their armies. In December 1778, he was appointed\r\nMajor of the 21st Light Dragoons, and, on the formation of the 23rd\r\nLight Dragoons for Indian service, he was selected to be its Lt.\r\nColonel. No better choice could have been made. A thorough soldier,\r\nand a horseman from his youth up, brought up in the school of two\r\nsuch cavalry soldiers as Sir John Elliott and Lord Pembroke, he was\r\nan enthusiastic believer in the power of cavalry. Writing from San\r\nThomé in 1784, he says:\r\n\r\n  “You may depend upon it, the first military miracle that is to be\r\n  performed in India, will be wrought by cavalry. No one here has\r\n  an idea of that arm; a small body of well disciplined Europeans\r\n  on horseback, judiciously led, will defeat and destroy myriads of\r\n  Indian enemies. If I am of the party, it may perhaps afford me an\r\n  opportunity of deserving your applause.”\r\n\r\nAll soldiers know how an able commander can impress his character on\r\na regiment, to endure long after his connexion with it has ceased.\r\nSuch was the case with the regiment that gathered laurels as the 19th\r\nLight Dragoons, and no small part of its glory was due to its first\r\nLieutenant Colonel, John Floyd. The correctness of his views as to\r\nthe great part cavalry might play, and the excellence of his system,\r\nwere demonstrated on many a field in which the regiment fought during\r\nits career in India.\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown[21] how, in June 1783, the 19th Light\r\nDragoons and all Cavalry regiments above that number, on the\r\nestablishment in England, were disbanded. For three years, the fate\r\nof the 23rd seems to have hung in the balance. At last, on 26th\r\nApril 1786, an order was issued to the effect that henceforward\r\nthe regiment was to be numbered the 19th, instead of the 23rd, a\r\ndesignation under which it was destined to win itself fame and\r\nhonour.[22]\r\n\r\nBefore this, a change was made in the uniform of all the Light\r\nDragoon regiments in the service. Hitherto, all mounted regiments had\r\nworn scarlet. In 1784, it was determined to distinguish the Light\r\nDragoons, by dressing them in blue, and the following order gives the\r\nwhole dress in detail.\r\n\r\n  _Regulations for the Clothing of the Light Dragoons, April 1784._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1784. April.]\r\n\r\n  The Clothing of a private Light Dragoon to consist of a Jacket\r\n  and Shell under waistcoat and leather Breeches.\r\n\r\n  The Jacket and Shell to be of blue cloth, the Collars and Cuffs\r\n  of the Royall Regiments to be Red;--and those of the other\r\n  Regiments to be of the colour of the facing of the Regiment,\r\n  looped upon the breast, and edged with white _thread_ Cord, and\r\n  to be lined with white, the 11th and 13th Regiments excepted,\r\n  which are to be lined with Buff.\r\n\r\n  The under waistcoat to be of flannel with Sleeves, and made so as\r\n  to be buttoned within the waistband of the Breeches.\r\n\r\n  The Breeches to be of Buckskin.\r\n\r\n  _N.B._--The make of the Dress and method of placing the Cord\r\n  upon the Breast of the Jacket, to be exactly conformable to the\r\n  pattern approved of by His Majesty.\r\n\r\n  OFFICERS AND QUARTER MASTERS.\r\n\r\n  The Dress Uniform of the Officers and Quarter Masters of the\r\n  Light Dragoons to be made according to the King’s regulation of\r\n  the 19th December 1768, excepting that the Coats are to be Blue\r\n  and faced with the same colour as the private Men, and that the\r\n  Royall Regiments are to be faced with scarlet.\r\n\r\n  FIELD UNIFORM OF THE OFFICERS AND QUARTER MASTERS.\r\n\r\n  The Jacket and shell to be made up in the same manner as those of\r\n  the Men, excepting that the Shell is to have Sleeves, and that\r\n  the Looping is to be of Silver, the 13th Regiment excepted which\r\n  is to be of gold.\r\n\r\n  SERJEANTS.\r\n\r\n  The Serjeants of the Light Dragoons to be distinguished by Gold\r\n  or silver looping.\r\n\r\n  CORPORALS.\r\n\r\n  The Corporals of the Light Dragoons to be distinguished by a Gold\r\n  or Silver Cord round the Collar and Cuff.\r\n\r\n  TRUMPETERS.\r\n\r\n  The Trumpeters to have a Jacket and Shell the Colour of the\r\n  facing of the Regiment, with Lace instead of Looping in front and\r\n  down the Seams.\r\n\r\n  _N.B._--A Pattern Suit of Clothing made up according to these\r\n  Regulations, will be deposited at the Army-Comptroller’s\r\n  Office--Horse Guards.\r\n\r\nNo record now exists to show what facings were worn by the Regiment\r\nup to this date. Probably, their facings had never been decided on,\r\nowing to their departure from England so soon after embodiment,\r\nas, in December 1786, an order was issued, approving a pattern of\r\nyellow cloth for their facings. The blue jacket with primrose yellow\r\nfacings and white or silver braid, continued to be the uniform of\r\nthe regiment till December 1802, when an order came into force for\r\nDragoon regiments, serving in India, to wear grey instead of blue.\r\nIn February 1786 an order was issued directing the Colonels of Light\r\nDragoon regiments to supply their men with blue cloaks instead of red.\r\n\r\nThe vacancy caused by the death of Sir John Burgoyne was filled by\r\nthe appointment of Lieutenant General the Hon. Sir William Howe,[23]\r\nK.B., Colonel of the 23rd Foot, to be Colonel. He was an officer who\r\nhad seen much active service, principally in America, where he had\r\ngained the reputation of a brave rather than of a skilful soldier.\r\nAs a young man he took part in the conquest of Quebec by Wolfe, and\r\nled the forlorn hope of twenty-four men that forced the entrenched\r\npath by which Wolfe’s force scaled the heights of Abraham. He served\r\nat the siege of Belleisle (1761), where he was wounded. He commanded\r\nthe British troops at the pyrrhic victory of Bunker’s Hill; and\r\ngained victories over the revolted colonists at Long Island and at\r\nBrandywine.\r\n\r\nWe get a glimpse of the regiment on 15th December 1788, when they\r\nwere inspected by the Governor and Commander in Chief, Sir Archibald\r\nCampbell, who, in a minute to the rest of the Government, recorded\r\nthat “H.M.’s 19th Regiment of Light Dragoons were complete in\r\nhorses and accoutrements, and their discipline equal to any Corps\r\nin Europe.” In a general order he said “The rapid and accurate\r\nmanner with which the several evolutions were performed, and the\r\nextraordinary velocity of their charge, than which nothing could\r\nbe more regular and correct, does infinite honour to Colonel Floyd\r\nand the officers under his command, by whose unremitting zeal and\r\nattention the discipline of the corps has been carried to so high a\r\nstate of perfection.”\r\n\r\nThe regimental muster rolls for 1788 and 1789 show that the strength\r\nof the 19th, in those years, varied from 300 to 350 men present at\r\nShevtamodoo. The strength in horses seems to have exceeded that in\r\nmen, but the wear and tear in horseflesh was apparently very great,\r\nand remounts in considerable numbers were constantly required.\r\n\r\nIt was during these years spent by the regiment at Shevtamodoo, that\r\nthe Madras Government dealt in earnest with the question of forming a\r\nservice of Native Cavalry. To assist them in this work they selected\r\nFloyd, who was given a free hand in all that concerned the discipline\r\nand equipment of the Native regiments. The system founded by him may\r\nbe said to have lasted nearly up to the present time.\r\n\r\nFrom this time up to the date of their departure from India, the 19th\r\nLight Dragoons never ceased to furnish non-commissioned officers and\r\nprivates as instructors to the Native Cavalry, not only in Madras,\r\nbut also in Bengal. In every muster roll they are shown on duty, at\r\nMadras, Vellore, Hyderabad, Seringapatam, Poonamallee, and other\r\nmilitary stations in the Madras Presidency. In Bengal there were\r\nalways from four to sixteen sergeants, corporals, and privates on\r\nthis duty, as long as the regiment was in India, and, for a time,\r\nsome were on similar duty in Bombay and Poona. A General Order,\r\ndated Fort William 3rd December 1795, sanctions the sergeants of the\r\n19th Light Dragoons “now on service in this presidency instructing\r\nthe native cavalry, to receive the pay and allowances of Sergeant\r\nMajors of Cavalry.” In 1798 a General Order was issued, directing\r\n“the brass chapes and sockets to be made up according to the pattern\r\nfurnished by Major General Floyd.” And in December 1805, a few months\r\nbefore the regiment left India, each native cavalry regiment in the\r\nPresidency was ordered to send a detachment to Arcot, for instruction\r\nin one uniform system by Lieutenant Neville, 19th Light Dragoons.\r\nThe system observed in the Company’s native cavalry up till 1857,\r\nmay be said to have been founded by Colonel Floyd and the 19th Light\r\nDragoons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWAR WITH TIPPOO\r\n\r\n1790\r\n\r\n  War with Tippoo--19th take the field--Advance on\r\n  Coimbatore--Division under Floyd detached towards Guzzulhutti\r\n  Pass--Frequent skirmishes--Satyamunglum--Dispersion of the\r\n  Army--Advance of Tippoo--19th hotly engaged--Tippoo’s Body-Guard\r\n  destroyed--Retreat from Satyamunglum--Casualties--March in\r\n  pursuit of Tippoo--Private Parkes--The Tapoor Pass--Tippoo eludes\r\n  pursuit, and ravages the Carnatic--Army returns to Madras.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1790, the Government of India again became involved in war with\r\nTippoo. He had been constrained to sign the peace of Mangalore by the\r\nwithdrawal of the French alliance, and the coalition of the British\r\nand Mahrattas against him. But the war had been a triumph for Mysore\r\narms. South of the Kistna river, Mysore was the most powerful state\r\nin India, and no single power could hold its own against the son of\r\nHyder Ali. But Tippoo failed to realize the increase of power of the\r\nEnglish Company, due to five years of peace. In 1785, a quarrel broke\r\nout between him and the Mahrattas, who allied themselves with the\r\nNizam, and invaded Mysore territory. The campaign that ensued was\r\nin Tippoo’s favour, and peace was concluded between the contending\r\nparties in April 1787. Tippoo’s warlike restlessness continued to be\r\na menace to the other powers in India. In the end of 1787, overtures\r\nfor an alliance against him, were made to Calcutta by the Mahrattas.\r\nTo this, Lord Cornwallis, who had assumed the direction of affairs\r\nas Governor General and Commander in Chief in September 1786, gave\r\na refusal. But nothing could keep Tippoo quiet. In 1788 he sent\r\nan embassy to France, to propose an alliance against the English,\r\nand, in December 1789, he attacked the Rajah of Travancore whom we\r\nwere bound by treaty to protect. Preparations were at once made to\r\npunish the aggression, and orders were transmitted to Madras for the\r\ncommencement of operations against Mysore.\r\n\r\nThe time had come for the 19th Light Dragoons to show their worth.\r\nOne morning, early in January, came the news that war was imminent,\r\nand that the Regiment was to join the army ordered to assemble at\r\nTrichinopoly. “My men were on horseback, going to water, when the\r\nnews arrived, and they received it with three most cordial cheers.\r\nNothing but good humour and high hope prevail in the Army. My\r\nregiment is ready in all that depends on us, and willing beyond\r\ndescription.”[24] But great delay ensued, and some weeks elapsed\r\nbefore a move was made. The Madras Government disobeyed the stringent\r\norders of Cornwallis, to warn Tippoo that an attack on Travancore\r\nwould entail war, and to take all necessary steps for prosecuting\r\nwar if the attack was made. There was a complete want of military\r\npreparation. Fortunately, on 19th February, Major General Medows\r\narrived from England with full powers as Governor and Commander in\r\nChief in Madras, and preparations for the campaign were made in\r\nearnest. A force was assembled near Wallajabad, and marched for\r\nTrichinopoly on 29th March. The 19th Light Dragoons at this time\r\nmustered 355 sabres. Meanwhile Tippoo took advantage of the delay\r\nto prosecute his conquest over Travancore, which he would have\r\ncompleted, had not a small force from Bombay, under Colonel Hartley,\r\nlanded in Travancore, in the end of April, and taken up a strong\r\ndefensive position. On 24th May, General Medows took command of the\r\narmy at Trichinopoly, amounting to about 15,000 men. On the same day,\r\nTippoo turned his back on Travancore, and made his way northwards to\r\nconfront his foes.\r\n\r\nMysore, the heart of Tippoo’s Kingdom, is a high plateau from 2000\r\nto 3000 feet above the sea, open towards the north, but fenced in\r\nto the East, South and West by precipitous, cliff-like ranges that\r\noverlook the low country outside, and are only passable for an army\r\nat certain places. Tippoo had also extensive possessions in the low\r\ncountry, from which he drew large revenues and plentiful military\r\nsupplies. According to the plan of operations adopted, Medows was\r\nto advance on Mysore from the southward, and, if possible, enter it\r\nby the Guzulhutti Pass, after making himself master of the rich low\r\ncountry about Coimbatore, where abundant supplies could be obtained.\r\nAs this movement would uncover Madras, a small force was held at\r\nConjeveram, under Colonel Kelly, which was augmented later by a force\r\nof six battalions of sepoys and some artillery, that were dispatched\r\noverland from Bengal. On the west, a force from Bombay under\r\nMajor General Abercromby[25] was destined to act against Tippoo’s\r\npossessions in Malabar, and, if events rendered it desirable, to\r\neffect a junction with Medows. On the occurrence of Tippoo’s attack\r\non Travancore in December, the Peishwa had renewed his offers of\r\nalliance to Lord Cornwallis. This time they were accepted, and a\r\ntriple convention between the Peishwa, the Nizam and the British,\r\nwas concluded. By it, the two former engaged to attack Tippoo’s\r\nNorthern possessions at once with 25,000 horse, and after the rains,\r\nto act with their utmost means. So dilatory were their movements,\r\nthat it was not till the following year that their operations had any\r\nshare of importance in the campaign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map\r\n\r\nto illustrate MYSORE CAMPAIGNS\r\n\r\n  _Walker & Boutall sc._]\r\n\r\nOn the 26th May, the army marched from Trichinopoly, but, owing to\r\nbadness of transport, it was not till 15th June that Karoor was\r\noccupied. Avaracoorchi and Darapooram were occupied, on the 5th\r\nand 10th July respectively. Tippoo was at this time at Coimbatore,\r\nwhere it was hoped he would make a stand. The siege guns and stores\r\nwere therefore deposited in Darapooram, and the army advanced.\r\nInformation was soon received of his having gone northward, and\r\nascended the defiles on to the Mysore plateau, leaving a force of\r\nCavalry numbering from 3000 to 5000, under Said Sahib, as a corps\r\nof observation. After recovering the heavy guns, the advance was\r\ncontinued, watched by Said Sahib who fell back on Coimbatore, with\r\nthe intention of burning the town on the near approach of the British\r\nforce. To prevent this, Floyd with the cavalry was dispatched to\r\noccupy the town, which was accomplished on 21st July, the main body\r\narriving the following day, while Said Sahib fell back to Demiacotta\r\non the Bhowani river. Floyd, with the 19th Light Dragoons, three\r\nregiments of Native Cavalry, two companies of sepoys and four 6\r\npr. guns, was dispatched in pursuit. About ten o’clock at night on\r\nthe 22nd, after a thirty-mile march, he surprised near Demiacotta\r\na small body of horse, about thirty of whom were made prisoners.\r\nThe exaggerated accounts they gave him, led him to believe that the\r\nforce with Said Sahib was larger than had been supposed. The Fort of\r\nDemiacotta having taken the alarm, opened fire, and, there being no\r\nforage obtainable, Floyd considered it prudent to fall back a few\r\nmiles. On the 28th, he moved forward again, and, on reaching the\r\nbanks of the river, discovered that Said Sahib had carried his force\r\nacross the river, and was encamped on the other side. The Bhowani\r\nriver, at this time, was only fordable at certain places. A few long\r\nshots from the six pounders made Said Sahib decamp, and direct his\r\nmarch towards the Guzulhutti Pass. Floyd then fell back to Velladi,\r\nand remained in observation of the two roads leading from Coimbatore\r\nto the Bhowani river, moving occasionally to Shawoor and Occarro. On\r\nthe 16th of August, Colonel Floyd with a Corporal and six Dragoons,\r\nset out from Shawoor to visit Occarro, where there was a troop of\r\nNative Cavalry on detachment duty. On arrival at Occarro, it was\r\nreported to him that there was a body of the enemy’s horse in the\r\nneighbourhood. Taking twelve men of the troop with his original\r\nescort, he went in search of them, and discovered them close to\r\nthe village. He immediately charged them, and put the whole body\r\nto flight. Four days later, Major Affleck[26] of the 19th Light\r\nDragoons, with two troops of the 19th and an equal number of the\r\n5th Native Cavalry, while patrolling, fell in with a large body of\r\nthe enemy’s horsemen whom they instantly attacked, killing upwards\r\nof forty, and capturing twenty horses. Not many days after this, an\r\nequally successful skirmish occurred under the command of Lieut.\r\nBayly of the 19th Light Dragoons, who, with a troop of the 19th and\r\ntwo troops of Native Cavalry, put a large body of the enemy’s horse\r\nto rout, and drove them into the river. In a private letter written\r\nfour months later, Floyd says: “Among a great number of cavalry\r\nskirmishes I was always successful, and fully established for the\r\nfirst time in India, the infinite superiority of European over Native\r\nhorse.”\r\n\r\nWhile Floyd was thus engaged to the north of Coimbatore, a force\r\nunder Colonel Oldham was sent against Erode, which surrendered,\r\non the 6th August, after a feeble resistance. Another force, under\r\nColonel Stuart, was sent against Dindigal, which surrendered, after\r\none unsuccessful assault, on the 23rd August. Several other small\r\nforts in the neighbourhood were also captured. Further reinforcements\r\nwere sent to Stuart, who was directed to proceed against Palghat. A\r\nbreach was effected, and the place surrendered on 22nd September;\r\nbut, before this, events had occurred that completely altered the\r\naspect of affairs.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of August, having been reinforced by three battalions of\r\nsepoys and five guns, Floyd crossed the Bhowani, and made himself\r\nmaster of the Fort of Satyamunglum, which was taken by surprise\r\nwithout any loss. A native battalion was placed in the Fort, and all\r\nSaid Sahib’s detached horsemen were driven into the Guzulhutti Pass.\r\nThe force was then withdrawn to the south bank of the river, the\r\nfords of which were constantly visited by strong patrols. Further\r\nreinforcements reached Floyd, whose force now consisted of the 19th\r\nLight Dragoons and three regiments of Native Cavalry, H.M. 36th, and\r\nfour battalions of sepoys, with eleven guns of different calibres.\r\nExclusive of the artillerymen, the force numbered about two thousand\r\neight hundred fighting men.\r\n\r\nSo far, all had gone well in spite of much sickness in the army, and\r\ngreat difficulties due to the heavy rains. A chain of posts had been\r\nestablished to the foot of the Guzulhutti Pass, the flanks of the\r\narmy were well protected, and Tippoo’s garrisons had been expelled\r\nfrom every important place in the Coimbatore district. The force\r\nunder Medows, at Coimbatore, had been reduced to three native and\r\ntwo European battalions without their flank companies. Floyd, with\r\nthe force already mentioned, was watching the Guzulhutti Pass, some\r\nforty miles to the northward. With Stuart besieging Palghat, some\r\nthirty miles south west of Coimbatore, were one regiment of Native\r\nCavalry, one European and five Native battalions of Infantry, besides\r\nsix European companies belonging to three different Regiments, and\r\na detachment of Artillery. Besides this, there were detachments\r\noccupying Karoor, Erode, Darapooram, Dindigal, and a few other\r\nsmall posts. Nothing but the fall of Palghat was wanting to permit\r\nof a concentrated forward movement on the Guzulhutti Pass. To the\r\neastward, the force that had been left at Conjeveram under Colonel\r\nKelly had been reinforced by the division from Bengal, and had\r\nmoved to Arnee, where Colonel Kelly’s death gave the command to\r\nColonel Maxwell. It consisted of one regiment of Native Cavalry,\r\nthree European and eight Native battalions of Infantry, and some\r\nArtillery, amounting altogether to nine thousand five hundred men.\r\nTo the southward on the Travancore border was Colonel Hartley,\r\nwith one European and four Native battalions of Infantry, moving\r\ntowards Palghat, which he reached after its capture. The whole\r\nforce was dangerously scattered, and Tippoo, who had excellent\r\nintelligence of all that occurred, was not slow to take advantage of\r\nthe circumstance. So far, the only active measure he had undertaken\r\nhad been the dispatch of a small body of marauding horse into the\r\nCarnatic by the Changama Pass. They plundered and burned Porto Novo,\r\nbut did little other damage.\r\n\r\nLeaving Seringapatam on the 2nd September, with forty thousand men\r\nand a large train of Artillery, Tippoo reached the Guzulhutti Pass\r\non the 9th, and completed the descent in the two following days.\r\nFloyd was not unaware of the increased force in his front, and of\r\nthe reports of Tippoo’s advance, and, in his report to Medows,\r\nsuggested the advisability of his falling back towards Coimbatore.\r\nBut the intelligence was disbelieved, and he was ordered to maintain\r\nhis position. He was at that time encamped on the south side of the\r\nBhowani opposite to Satyamunglum. On the 12th Floyd dispatched an\r\nexpress messenger to Medows telling of the increased forces of the\r\nenemy, and that Tippoo was advancing in person. At two o’clock in the\r\nmorning of the 13th, Cavalry picquets of the 19th Light Dragoons and\r\n2nd and 5th Native Cavalry, under Captain Child of the 19th, were\r\nordered to reconnoitre towards the Poongar ford, about ten miles up\r\nthe river. A few hours later, the 5th Native Cavalry, under Major\r\nDarley, was ordered to follow in support. By some mischance, Darley\r\ntook a different road from that which Child had followed. Tippoo had\r\nhowever begun to pass his troops over the river the day before, after\r\nthe withdrawal of the morning reconnoissance, and Child suddenly\r\nfound himself opposed by a considerable body of horse. Charging them\r\nat once, he drove them into the river, whereby many were killed and\r\ndrowned: he then fell back by the same road. The country all around\r\nwas laid out in small enclosures with cactus hedges, rendering it\r\nvery difficult to see any distance. Major Darley, advancing by the\r\nother road, charged and overthrew a body of about two hundred horse,\r\ninflicting great loss, but was, immediately after, nearly surrounded\r\nby some six or seven thousand of the enemy’s Cavalry. Sending back\r\nnews to the camp, he took up a position on some high ground where\r\nhis flanks were protected by cactus hedges, and kept the enemy at\r\nbay by carbine fire. After some time he was joined by the 3rd Native\r\nCavalry, and, a little later, Floyd with the 19th Light Dragoons,\r\nand the picquets under Captain Child, attracted by the firing,\r\ncame up. On seeing these reinforcements, the enemy drew off, Floyd\r\nfollowed them up and inflicted heavy losses on them. Two squadrons\r\nof the 19th charged a large body of the Sultan’s Body Guard that had\r\ngot entangled in an enclosure from which there was no outlet, and\r\nput upwards of five hundred, it is said, to the sword. The enemy’s\r\nleader was slain by a private dragoon, while his standard bearer\r\nwas cut down and the standard taken by a Corporal. The green flag of\r\nIslam was also captured. The field was cleared of every opponent,\r\nand the cavalry returned to camp. Scarcely had they dismounted when\r\na large force was seen approaching on the north bank of the river,\r\nwhence some heavy guns were brought to bear. At the same time, a\r\nsecond force was perceived approaching the left flank along the\r\nsouth bank. This necessitated a change of position by our troops,\r\nand the Sultan contented himself with keeping up a heavy cannonade,\r\nwithout a closer attack. During the whole day, the force remained in\r\nthis trying position. Floyd’s eleven guns were not only outnumbered,\r\nbut were obliged to husband their ammunition which was limited.\r\nThe cannonade ceased at nightfall, and the enemy withdrew to some\r\ndistance. Tippoo never liked camping too close to the English, for\r\nfear of a night surprise. Of the English guns, three were disabled,\r\nand there had been serious casualties among the troops, the horses,\r\nand the gun bullocks. Many of the bullock drivers had also deserted.\r\nThe night was very dark with heavy rain, the Infantry lay on their\r\narms, and the Cavalry remained at the heads of their horses. About\r\nmidnight, it was determined to fall back upon Coimbatore, through\r\nShawoor, the force having been driven from the direct line of retreat\r\nthrough Velladi. It was necessary first to bring the garrison of\r\nSatyamunglum across the river. In doing this, great delay ensued, and\r\nit was four o’clock before the troops could be put in motion. Owing\r\nto the destruction among the gun bullocks, three guns were obliged\r\nto be left behind. Fortunately for the English, the Sultan’s army\r\nhad been greatly inconvenienced by the heavy rain during the night,\r\nand it was some hours before Tippoo could collect a sufficient force\r\nto follow the retreat. When he moved, his well-equipped artillery\r\nsoon caught up the slow-moving British column, and pressed heavily\r\non its flanks and rear. The first attack was made by a body of\r\nCavalry, who fell upon the baggage, the greater part of which was\r\nlost, and the Surgeon’s mate, Sutherland, of the 19th Light Dragoons\r\nkilled. The force reached Occarro about eleven o’clock, but after a\r\nshort halt was obliged to resume its march, as Tippoo’s army was now\r\nmoving on its flank. Owing to the exhaustion of the gun bullocks,\r\nthree more guns were obliged to be left behind there. The safety of\r\nthe remaining guns was assured by a number of officers sacrificing\r\ntheir baggage, and giving their private bullocks to draw the guns.\r\nOn account of the close nature of the country, the rear guard duty\r\nhad to be taken by the Infantry, and the Cavalry was sent forward.\r\nDuring the whole march, the force was exposed to a continuous fire\r\nof musketry, heavy guns, and rockets, which was especially directed\r\nagainst H.M.’s 36th. On approaching Shawoor, the enemy pressed so\r\nclosely on the column, that the Infantry were obliged to form up\r\nand show a front, while the Cavalry, unable to act among the cactus\r\nhedges, led the column. At this moment, a report was spread that\r\nGeneral Medows had arrived to their assistance, and a detachment\r\nof the 19th Light Dragoons which had passed through Shawoor, and\r\nappeared on the opposite side of the village, was mistaken for the\r\nhead of his column. The news was greeted with cheers; and Tippoo was\r\nalso deceived by the report which spread through both armies. The\r\nInfantry advanced, and drove back the enemy, whose discomfiture was\r\ncompleted by the Cavalry, who pursued on both flanks, and completely\r\ncleared the field. The force remained in Shawoor during the night,\r\nwithout being molested, Tippoo, who at first believed the news of\r\nMedow’s arrival, having drawn off to some distance. Floyd fired\r\nthree signal guns to show his position to General Medows, who had\r\nmarched on the same day to Floyd’s assistance, but not being aware\r\nof his retreat by the Shawoor route, had marched on Velladi, where\r\nhe encamped that evening. Floyd had received intelligence of Medow’s\r\nmarch on Velladi, and, recognizing the great importance of forming\r\na junction, marched again before daylight, and reached Velladi on\r\nthe evening of the 15th. The enemy did not pursue, and the troops\r\nwere enabled to get food and rest, after being three days without\r\neither. Medows however was not at Velladi, having gone on towards\r\nDemiacotta, to which circumstance may be ascribed the peaceful march\r\nof Floyd’s troops on the 15th. The junction between the two forces\r\nwas effected on the 16th. The Sultan, on hearing of Medows’ movement\r\ntowards Demiacotta, withdrew on the same day to the north side of\r\nthe Bhowani. Had he acted with greater energy, and pressed Floyd’s\r\nforce on the 15th, he might have won a great success. The troops\r\nwere exhausted, and would have yielded to determined attacks on the\r\nthird day of their retreat. In such an event, the disaster would\r\ncertainly have extended to Medows’ force, which consisted only of\r\nfive incomplete battalions, and Stuart’s force at Palghat would also\r\nhave been involved in ruin. The respect with which Tippoo treated the\r\nretreating force was largely due to the gallant bearing of the 19th,\r\nand especially to the severe lesson they taught the enemy on the\r\n13th. In addition to the six guns abandoned, the losses of the whole\r\ndetachment under Floyd, during the 13th and 14th, were as follows:--\r\n\r\n  _Europeans_--\r\n        Killed        43\r\n        Wounded       98\r\n        Missing        7\r\n\r\n  _Natives_--\r\n        Killed       128\r\n        Wounded      137\r\n        Missing      148\r\n\r\n  _Horses_--\r\n        Killed        22\r\n        Wounded        8\r\n        Missing       28\r\n\r\nThe Infantry were the principal sufferers. The losses of the 19th\r\nLight Dragoons amounted to\r\n\r\n  _Killed_--\r\n        1 Assistant Surgeon.\r\n        5 Troopers.\r\n\r\n  _Wounded_--\r\n        1 Quarter-Master.\r\n        8 Troopers.\r\n  _Horses_--\r\n        5 killed.\r\n        3 wounded.\r\n\r\nFive officers killed and eight wounded were among the casualties\r\nof the force, and nearly the whole of the baggage was lost. The\r\nlosses of the enemy were very heavy, among the slain being Tippoo’s\r\nbrother-in-law and many leaders of note. In spite of their tactical\r\nsuccess, the result of the two days’ fighting was to depress the\r\nspirits of Tippoo’s men, while the minds of the British troops were\r\nproportionately elated at their successful retreat, in presence of\r\nsuch an overwhelming force. Floyd received much credit, and Medows\r\nwas generous enough to acknowledge his error, in leaving the force\r\nin such an exposed position. Tippoo ascribed his want of success to\r\nthe cactus hedges, and, some years later, ordered them to be levelled\r\nthroughout the whole district. The gallant bearing of the 19th Light\r\nDragoons in this portion of the campaign, made an impression that\r\nspread to every Native Court in southern India, and gained them a\r\nreputation for fighting, that clung to them during the whole of their\r\nservice in India.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th, Medows marched from Velladi, and returned to Coimbatore\r\non the 23rd, after visiting Shawoor. At Coimbatore, he was joined by\r\nColonel Stuart from Palghat. On the 29th he left Coimbatore again,\r\nmarching northward to the Bhowani. Tippoo meanwhile had gone towards\r\nErode, which fell into his hands on the 25th. From Erode, Tippoo\r\nmarched towards Karoor, hoping to cut off a large convoy destined for\r\nMedows’ army. Medows followed, and received his convoy safely on the\r\n7th October. Tippoo meanwhile marched on Darapooram, which he took on\r\nthe 8th, and then marched towards Coimbatore, where Medows had left\r\nstores and heavy guns with but a feeble garrison. Fortunately, under\r\norders from Medows, Colonel Hartley, on reaching Palghat, had sent\r\non three sepoy battalions, which reached Coimbatore in time to save\r\nit from attack, and Tippoo turned off northwards when within a few\r\nmiles of the place. Medows reached Coimbatore on the 15th, and, after\r\nstrengthening the defences, again marched for Erode, which he reached\r\non the 2nd November. Some slight skirmishing with a small party of\r\nthe enemy’s horse occurred on the march, during which Private Parkes\r\nof the 19th Light Dragoons signalised himself, while on flanking\r\nduty, by attacking, single handed, six horsemen whom he encountered\r\nin a narrow road, and bringing in three horses and a prisoner.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Maxwell’s force had advanced from Arnee, and entered the\r\nBaramahal district near Vaniembadi on the 24th October. This forced\r\nTippoo to leave the Coimbatore district, and march northward to\r\nintercept Maxwell. So well was the movement covered, that several\r\ndays elapsed before Medows discovered where he had gone. But Tippoo,\r\nfailing to find Maxwell in a position favourable for attack, withdrew\r\nafter threatening him for four days, and was nearly caught between\r\ntwo fires by Medows’ advancing force. On the 17th, the two armies\r\nformed a junction, 12 miles south of Cauveripatam. Supplies were\r\nabundant, and Medows was now at the head of the finest army the\r\nCompany had ever put into the field. But Tippoo’s excellent system\r\nof intelligence, and the greater mobility of his army gave him the\r\ngreat advantage of choosing his own field of action, so long as he\r\nwas not brought to bay in the heart of his own country. He calculated\r\nwith justice that, if he moved in the direction of the Carnatic,\r\nMedows would be obliged to follow him, and relinquish his projects\r\non Mysore. Accordingly, on the 18th, he put his army in motion for\r\nTrichinopoly by the Tapoor Pass. As fortune would have it, Medows\r\nmarched on the same day, with the intention of traversing the same\r\nPass, and reached it after the Sultan’s army had begun to enter\r\nit. The British advance brigade, under Colonel Floyd, consisted\r\nof the 19th Light Dragoons, three regiments of Native Cavalry and\r\nthree sepoy battalions. The Sultan’s rear was covered by a body of\r\ntwo thousand Cavalry, who showed a bold front. Medows became over\r\ncautious, and waited for his artillery. So well were the Mysore\r\nCavalry handled, that no advantage was gained beyond the cutting off\r\nfrom the Pass of three battalions which were forced into the jungle.\r\nTippoo’s baggage also was unable to enter the Pass, but suffered no\r\nloss; the main body got through, and continued its march without\r\nmishap. Thus was let slip an opportunity of striking a severe blow\r\nunder most advantageous conditions.\r\n\r\nTippoo continued his march on Trichinopoly, wasting the country as he\r\nproceeded, and hoping to make himself master of the place, which was\r\nnot strongly defended, before Medows could reach it. But the swollen\r\nstate of the Cauvery river saved the place from attack, and Tippoo\r\nwithdrew, in time to avoid Medows, who arrived before Trichinopoly\r\non the 14th December. Two days before this, Lord Cornwallis arrived\r\nin Madras, with the intention of taking command of the army in the\r\nfield; and at once summoned Medows to bring the force to Madras.\r\nMeanwhile, Tippoo turned northwards, and, ravaging the country as\r\nhe passed, attacked Tiaghur, a small rock fortress, under the walls\r\nof which a great number of the country people had gathered for\r\nprotection. Here also Tippoo was rejoined by his heavy baggage,\r\nwhich had become separated from him at the Tapoor Pass. After two\r\nassaults, which were repulsed with heavy loss to the assailants,\r\nthe Sultan left Tiaghur, and marched on Trinomalli which was not\r\ngarrisoned. After a feeble resistance from the inhabitants, the place\r\nwas plundered, and great barbarities committed. Turning eastward,\r\nTippoo took Permacoil, where there was only a single company of\r\nNative Infantry, whose commander had orders to retreat if threatened.\r\nOwing to treachery, Tippoo was able to surround the place before this\r\ncould be done. Tippoo then marched towards Pondicherry, where he\r\nremained some time, and dispatched an embassy to France, proposing\r\nan alliance, and asking for a force of 6000 French troops to be\r\nsent him. Medows followed the Mysore force as far as Trinomalli,\r\nwhence he turned towards Madras. The siege-guns and heavy stores\r\nwere left at Arnee, with a division under Major General Musgrave,\r\nand the remainder of the force reached Vellout, eighteen miles from\r\nMadras, on the 27th January 1791. Before this, a brilliant success\r\nhad been gained by Colonel Hartley, who, with three battalions,\r\ncompletely routed a large Mysore force near Calicut, on the 10th\r\nDecember, capturing Tippoo’s lieutenant and two thousand four hundred\r\nprisoners, in the action and in the subsequent pursuit. The Bombay\r\nforce under General Abercromby, whose movements had been greatly\r\ndelayed, was not able to commence operations till the beginning of\r\nDecember. Then Tippoo’s garrisons in Malabar were quickly captured,\r\nand the whole province occupied.\r\n\r\nThe Mahrattas and the Nizam had been tardy in their operations.\r\nBoth were unwilling to come within Tippoo’s reach, until they could\r\nbe certain of his being fully occupied with the English forces. On\r\nthe 25th August, the Mahrattas commenced operations, and, on 18th\r\nSeptember, laid siege to Dharwar. The attack was so badly conducted,\r\nthat the place did not capitulate till 4th April following, when the\r\nMahratta force, under Pareshram Bhow and Hari Punt, moved on toward\r\nSeringapatam. The Nizam moved in concert with the Mahrattas, but\r\ndelayed greatly, after crossing the Kistna, before attacking Kopaul,\r\nthe siege of which was begun on the 28th October. The fortress\r\ncapitulated on the 18th April following.\r\n\r\nAccording to a muster roll taken at Clive’s Choultry on 24th\r\nDecember, the 19th Light Dragoons had fifty men in hospital, out of a\r\ntotal of 270 non-commissioned officers and troopers present. Fourteen\r\ndeaths occurred in the preceding six months. During the same period,\r\n50 horses had died, and 14 had been rendered unfit for further\r\nservice, out of a total effective strength of 386.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCORNWALLIS’ CAMPAIGNS\r\n\r\n1791-1792\r\n\r\n  Cornwallis takes command of the Army--Advance on Bangalore--Order\r\n  of March--Floyd’s reconnoissance--Imprudent advance--Floyd\r\n  badly wounded--Casualties--Capture of Bangalore--Advance on\r\n  Seringapatam--Battle of Arikera--Army in great straits--Forced\r\n  to retreat--Junction of Mahratta contingent--19th sent to\r\n  Madras--Rejoin Cornwallis--Advance on Seringapatam--Night\r\n  attack--Floyd detached to meet Abercromby--Seringapatam\r\n  invested--Peace made--Tippoo’s hostages--19th return to\r\n  Shevtamodoo.\r\n\r\n\r\nCornwallis assumed command of the army, at Vellout, on the 29th\r\nJanuary 1791. By taking the field in person, he ensured the fullest\r\nco-operation of the civil and military administration, while it was\r\nhoped that his presence at the head of the troops, would induce the\r\nNizam and the Mahrattas to prosecute the war with more vigour than\r\nthey had yet shown. Instead of attacking Mysore from the south, as\r\nhad been done in the preceding year, Cornwallis proposed to operate\r\non a more direct line. The considerations that had led to the\r\nrejection of this line in 1790, were, that Seringapatam could not\r\nbe approached without first taking Bangalore, a place only second\r\nto Seringapatam in strength. The siege of Bangalore would have to\r\nbe carried on at a distance of ninety miles from the nearest depôt,\r\nAmboor; and the country between Seringapatam and Bangalore was\r\nunfertile, and not likely to furnish much in the way of supplies.\r\n\r\nThe army left Vellout on the 5th February. Tippoo, who had remained\r\nin the neighbourhood of Pondicherry, on hearing of the movement,\r\nhastily regained Mysore by the Changama and Palicode Passes.\r\nCornwallis, after making a feint towards Amboor, which completely\r\ndeceived the Sultan, turned northwards, and carried the army through\r\nthe Mooglee Pass without opposition. Without firing a shot, the whole\r\narmy was concentrated on the Mysore plateau by the 18th February.\r\nHere the army was joined by sixty-seven elephants from Bengal, the\r\nfirst occasion of these animals being employed in any considerable\r\nnumber by a British force. Hitherto, the movements of our armies had\r\nbeen greatly hampered by the difficulties of moving heavy siege guns;\r\nbut on this occasion, by yoking the bullocks four instead of two\r\nabreast, and by the use of elephants to lift and push the guns in bad\r\nground, the heavy guns were able to move with nearly as much ease as\r\nany other part of the army.\r\n\r\nAmong other beneficial changes made by Lord Cornwallis, was an\r\nimprovement in the order of march of the army. Before this war, our\r\narmies in India had marched with few cavalry and very small trains\r\nof artillery. They moved in a single column two or three files deep,\r\nwith the stores, baggage and camp followers on one flank, covered by\r\na strong party. This order was fatiguing to the troops, made rapid\r\nmovement impossible, caused great delay in assuming any formation\r\non coming in contact with the enemy, and exposed the camp followers\r\nand baggage to great losses from the enemy’s cavalry. Colonel\r\nFullarton, in his brief campaign of 1783, remedied this, to some\r\nextent, by making the army move on a broad front of three brigades,\r\nthe artillery and baggage following in rear covered on each flank\r\nby other brigades. The troops marched with intervals to permit of\r\nspeedily forming line in any direction.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the campaign of 1790 the old order was\r\nreverted to. The battering train, which marched in rear of the\r\ncolumn, often fell so far behind, that it did not reach the camping\r\nground till the following day. It was then placed in the centre of\r\nthe column. This only had the effect of delaying all in rear of\r\nthe guns, and separating the army into two portions. It was then\r\ntried to improve matters, by placing the heavy guns in front of the\r\ncolumn. This answered better when the guns were few, but with a large\r\nbattering train gave bad results. The plan adopted by Cornwallis,\r\nwas to make the infantry and cavalry move in parallel columns, some\r\ndistance apart. Between them, moved two columns one composed of\r\nartillery and stores, while the other was composed of the baggage and\r\ncamp followers, controlled by a baggage master. The army thus moved\r\nin a huge oblong, with the fighting men on the flanks. The front\r\nwas covered by the advance guard, consisting of a cavalry regiment\r\nand the infantry picquets coming on duty. In the same way, the rear\r\nwas covered by a regiment of cavalry and the infantry picquets last\r\non duty, forming the rear guard. The same order was observed in\r\nencamping. The infantry and cavalry camped in two lines, facing\r\noutwards, with the artillery, engineer corps, stores, baggage and\r\ncamp followers in the space between. The order thus established by\r\nCornwallis during this campaign, may be said to have held good in\r\nIndia up till the present day.\r\n\r\nThis appearance of a British army on the plateau of Mysore, marks\r\nthe increase that had taken place in the military power of the East\r\nIndia Company during the past five years. In our previous wars with\r\nHyder Ali and Tippoo, the operations of our armies had been confined\r\nto the low-lying country below the Ghauts, and the scene of warfare\r\nhad been almost always the Company’s own territories in the vicinity\r\nof Madras, or the territories of our native allies in the Carnatic.\r\nNow, for the first time, the war was carried into the very heart of\r\nMysore territory.\r\n\r\nTippoo’s movements, at this time, were characterised by unwonted\r\nindecision and want of energy. Instead of impeding and harassing\r\nthe march of the army, he contented himself with watching the\r\nadvance, with the intention rather of taking advantage of any mistake\r\ncommitted by the English commander, than of following any plan of his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th March, the British force reached Bangalore, and took\r\nup its ground without any loss, beyond a few casualties caused by\r\na distant cannonade on the march. On the following day, the army\r\nchanged ground, and took up a better position on the North West face\r\nof the pettah.[27] In the afternoon, Colonel Floyd was detached\r\nto the south west of the town, to cover a reconnoissance by the\r\nengineers. He had with him his own brigade, consisting of the 19th\r\nLight Dragoons under Captain Child, and five Regiments of native\r\nCavalry, besides a Brigade of three battalions of Infantry, with a\r\ndetachment of Artillery under Major Gowdie.\r\n\r\nThe work was satisfactorily accomplished, and the force was about\r\nto return, when a body of the enemy’s horse appeared. Leaving the\r\ninfantry and guns, Floyd moved against it, and, on its giving way,\r\ndiscovered some Mysore infantry, and guns, with large masses of\r\nbaggage and stores, elephants, bullock carts, camels and all the\r\nparaphernalia of an Eastern Army on the march. Tippoo was changing\r\nhis ground, and, by accident, the reconnoitring party had crossed the\r\nrear of his line of march. Disregarding his orders, Floyd allowed\r\nhimself to be persuaded to attack, by the young officers who were\r\nclamorous for the fray. The temptation was irresistible, and the\r\ncavalry advanced at a gallop. Some parties of infantry were charged\r\nand broken, and nine guns captured. As the advance continued, the\r\nground became much broken with ravines and low rocky hills. The\r\nhorses were exhausted, and the enemy, collecting their forces, opened\r\na heavy fire of musketry and rockets that checked the advance. At\r\nthis moment, Floyd fell from his horse, apparently dead, with a\r\nmusket ball in his head. At his fall, the squadron behind him made a\r\nhalf wheel to avoid trampling on their leader. This threw the line\r\ninto confusion, the flank squadrons took it for a signal to retire,\r\nand, in a few moments, the whole force was falling back. Fortunately\r\nfor Floyd, Corporal Murray and Private Buchanan remained with him,\r\nand, examining his wound, found that it was not mortal. Murray\r\nremained with him, while Buchanan galloped after the regiment, and in\r\na short time returned with a troop of the 19th, under Cornet Roderick\r\nMackenzie: Floyd was mounted on Buchanan’s horse and brought back to\r\nthe regiment. He was able to halt the regiment, and show a front to\r\nthe enemy, which checked them; but darkness was coming on; the enemy\r\npressed on, and the confusion was very great. The exhausted horses\r\nwere scarcely able to get back through the ravines they had cleared\r\nwith ease in their advance, and had it not been for the good judgment\r\nof Major Gowdie, who had advanced a mile beyond the place where he\r\nhad been left, and covered the retreat with his brigade, the losses\r\nwould have been very great. Lord Cornwallis, who had been able to see\r\nwhat was occurring from the encampment, put a division in motion,\r\nand met the whole detachment returning. Floyd’s wound was caused by\r\na bullet through his cheek, which lodged in his neck. It was never\r\nextracted, and he carried it to his grave, but he was sufficiently\r\nrecovered to take up his command again eleven days later. The losses\r\nof the detachment were as follows:--\r\n\r\n  _Killed_--\r\n        1 Officer.\r\n        1 Trumpeter.\r\n        18 Rank and File.\r\n        36 Horses.\r\n\r\n  _Wounded_--\r\n        2 Officers (European).\r\n        3 Native Officers.\r\n        43 Rank and File.\r\n        7 Horses.\r\n\r\n  _Missing_--\r\n        2 Trumpeters.\r\n        1 Rank and File.\r\n        228 Horses.\r\n\r\nThe losses of the 19th Light Dragoons were--\r\n\r\n  _Killed_--\r\n        1 Trumpeter.\r\n        2 Rank and File.\r\n        11 Horses.\r\n\r\n  _Wounded_--\r\n        1 Lieutenant Colonel.\r\n        7 Rank and File.\r\n\r\n  _Missing_--\r\n        4 Horses.\r\n\r\nMajor Skelly, Lord Cornwallis’ aide-de-camp, writing of the event a\r\nshort time afterwards, says: “I never saw Lord Cornwallis completely\r\nangry before that evening. To this day he cannot speak of that\r\nnight’s business without evident signs of disapprobation.”\r\n\r\nThe loss of so many horses at this early stage of the campaign was\r\na serious one, as they could not be replaced. The cavalry had been\r\nconstantly employed for the last three days, and the horses had not\r\nbeen regularly fed. Those that did not succumb on this occasion were\r\nof little use for the remainder of the campaign.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the pettah was taken by assault, and some\r\nmuch-needed supplies were obtained: but there was great scarcity\r\nof forage, and horses and transport animals suffered greatly. “The\r\ndraught cattle were daily dying at their pickets; grain and every\r\nother necessary, including ammunition, were at the lowest ebb.” In\r\nthese straits, Lord Cornwallis resolved to try and take the Fort by a\r\n_coup-de-main_. On the night of the 21st, the assault was delivered\r\nby moonlight, and in an hour the Fort was captured under the eyes of\r\nthe Sultan, who made no serious attempt to cause a diversion.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Bangalore was the first great blow that had\r\nbeen struck against the power of Mysore, by any foe, since its\r\nestablishment by Hyder Ali.\r\n\r\nLeaving a garrison in the place, Cornwallis moved northward, on the\r\n28th, with the twofold object of forming a junction with a corps of\r\nthe Nizam’s cavalry, and of meeting a convoy that was expected from\r\nAmboor. After some delay, caused by false intelligence purposely\r\nspread by Tippoo, the British force was joined at Cotapilli, on\r\n13th April, by 10,000 irregular horse of the Nizam’s, and, a week\r\nlater, the much-needed convoy, escorted by four thousand men, was\r\nmet at Venkitagheri. The combined force then returned to Bangalore,\r\nwhich was reached on the 28th. Arrangements were at once made for\r\nthe siege of Seringapatam, against which the Sultan sought to guard\r\nhimself, by wasting the intervening country; a measure that was not\r\nwithout effect on subsequent events.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th May, the British force reached Arikera, about nine miles\r\nfrom Seringapatam. The army moved with extreme difficulty, and\r\nthere was great distress, owing to the inadequate transport and the\r\nwasted state of the country. The Nizam’s cavalry refused to forage\r\nbeyond the outposts, and added to the scarcity: great quantities of\r\nammunition were dependent for carriage on the private resources of\r\nofficers and other individuals with the army. Before laying siege\r\nto Seringapatam, it was Cornwallis’ object to cross the Cauvery\r\nat Caniembadi, and form a junction with the Bombay force, under\r\nAbercromby, which was shortly expected. The Sultan, who had hitherto\r\nconfined himself to harassing the line of march, found it necessary\r\nto offer battle, to prevent if possible the threatened junction. With\r\nthis purpose he took up an extremely strong position about three\r\nmiles from Seringapatam, with his right resting on the Cauvery, and\r\nhis left on a rugged hill. His front was covered by a deep, swampy\r\nravine the passages of which were defended by batteries along the\r\nwhole front. Cornwallis determined to turn Tippoo’s left wing, and,\r\nby a night march, to place himself between Seringapatam and a great\r\nportion of the Mysore army. Halting at Arikera on the 14th, the\r\nforce marched at night, leaving the camp standing, with the heavy\r\nguns and stores. Unfortunately, there was a storm of extraordinary\r\nviolence that lasted several hours, which added to the confusion and\r\ndifficulties of a night march, and, when day broke, the force had\r\nonly accomplished three or four miles. All hope of surprise was at\r\nan end, but Cornwallis continued his advance. To meet the movement,\r\nTippoo threw back his left, and in order to cover his change of\r\nfront, detached a large corps of cavalry and infantry, with eight\r\nguns, to occupy a strong rocky ridge on his left, at right angles\r\nto the line of march of the British column. Owing to the depth of\r\nthe ravine to be crossed, and the weakness of the gun bullocks, it\r\ntook two hours before the British force could form up in line for\r\nattack; during which it was exposed to a galling artillery fire, and\r\nto some charges of cavalry, which were repulsed. The British force\r\nwas disposed, with nine battalions under Major General Medows, in the\r\nfirst line, opposite to the enemy’s main body; four battalions in\r\nthe second line, under Lt. Col. Harris; while five battalions, under\r\nLt. Col. Maxwell, were destined to attack the enemy’s corps on the\r\nridge to the right. The cavalry under Floyd, consisting of the 19th\r\nLight Dragoons and five Regiments of Native Cavalry, and the Nizam’s\r\nhorse, were left on the opposite side of the ravine, out of reach of\r\nartillery fire.\r\n\r\nThe action commenced by an advance of Maxwell’s force against the\r\nridge, which was taken, while the cavalry crossed the ravine, and\r\nfell on the rear of the Mysore infantry, inflicting considerable\r\nloss. But the exhausted horses could not raise a gallop, and they\r\nwere obliged to fall back from a strong body of infantry, that\r\nhad rallied and made a stand in some broken rocky ground. At this\r\njuncture, the Nizam’s horse, which had followed the British cavalry\r\nacross the ravine, threw itself in an unwieldy mass in front of the\r\nleft wing, preventing its advance, and detaining it under the fire of\r\nthe enemy’s batteries in Seringapatam. This unfortunate circumstance,\r\nwhich by many was ascribed to treachery on the part of the Nizam’s\r\ncommander, saved the enemy from destruction. The British line was\r\nfor some time unable to advance, and the enemy’s guns and infantry,\r\nin great confusion, were able to withdraw under protection of their\r\nbatteries across the river. Four guns were taken. The British loss\r\nwas 81 killed, 339 wounded, and 6 missing. Of this, the 19th Light\r\nDragoons lost\r\n\r\n  _Killed_--\r\n        1 Officer.    Cornet James Patterson.\r\n        2 Troopers.\r\n\r\n  _Wounded_--\r\n        2 Officers.   Cornet Roderick Mackenzie.\r\n                      Cornet John Fortnam.\r\n        2 Troopers.\r\n\r\n  _Horses_--\r\n        13 Killed.\r\n        11 Wounded.\r\n\r\nThe army was now in such a state, owing to want of proper supplies,\r\nwant of carriage, and an epidemic of smallpox, that it was\r\nnecessary to join hands with the Bombay force under Abercromby,\r\nbefore undertaking the siege. Abercromby had encountered great\r\ndifficulties in ascending the Passes into Mysore, and so excellent\r\nwas the work done by Tippoo’s cavalry, that Cornwallis was without\r\nany precise information as to his advance. Nor was anything known\r\nof the Mahratta contingent, beyond the fact that they had captured\r\nDharwar. Cornwallis therefore resolved on continuing his march on\r\nCaniembadi, to meet Abercromby. “For two marches, all the battering\r\ntrain and almost every public cart in the army were dragged by the\r\ntroops,” and Cornwallis came to the conclusion, that the state of\r\nhis force rendered a retirement on Bangalore imperative. The siege\r\ntrain and heavy stores could be carried no farther, and it was\r\nresolved to destroy them. On the 21st May, orders were despatched\r\nto Abercromby, who was then at Periapatam, about 25 miles to the\r\nwestward, to destroy his heavy stores, and retire below the Passes,\r\nand Cornwallis’ army was retained five days in position, to cover\r\nAbercromby’s movement. On the 22nd, the whole of the battering train\r\nand heavy stores were destroyed, and on the 26th, the first march\r\nof six miles was made in retreat. The distress was very great:\r\nthe troops were on half rations, and the only way of carrying what\r\ngrain was available was to distribute it among the fighting men.\r\n“Great part of the horses of the cavalry were so reduced by want\r\nand fatigue, that they could no longer carry their riders; and\r\nmany, unable to march, were shot at their pickets. The ground at\r\nCaniembadi, where the army had encamped but six days, was covered,\r\nin a circuit of several miles, with the carcasses of cattle and\r\nhorses.”[28] “All that occurred of mortality among the cattle, during\r\nthe siege of Bangalore, fell far short of the horrible scene and\r\npestilential air of this disgusting ground.”[29]\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the first day’s painful march, a body of two\r\nthousand cavalry appeared on the left flank. Preparations were\r\nmade to meet them, and shots were fired, when it was suddenly\r\ndiscovered that they were the advanced guard of the Mahratta force.\r\nIt was not known that they were within a hundred and fifty miles of\r\nSeringapatam, and not one of the numerous messengers they had sent to\r\nconvey notice of their approach, had succeeded in escaping Tippoo’s\r\nscouts. There were, in fact, two forces; one, under Hari Punt,\r\nconsisting of twelve thousand horse, and the other, under Pareshram\r\nBhow, of twenty thousand horse and foot, with two battalions of\r\nBombay sepoys, under Captain Little. They brought with them abundant\r\nsupplies, and plenty once more reigned in the British camp. Their\r\ncavalry foraged boldly in every direction, bringing in supplies from\r\ngreat distances, in striking contrast to the behaviour of the Nizam’s\r\nforce. But they came too late to permit of an attack on Seringapatam.\r\nHad Cornwallis known of their approach five days sooner, all would\r\nhave been well, and another campaign would have been spared him. But\r\nhis siege train no longer existed, the Bombay force had descended\r\nthe Ghauts, and there was nothing for it but to adhere to his resolve\r\nof falling back. The allied forces remained in the vicinity of\r\nSeringapatam till the 6th June, when they leisurely moved northwards\r\nto Nagmunglum, and thence eastward to Bangalore, taking the small\r\nhill fort of Hooliadroog on the way. “So reduced were the horses of\r\nour cavalry from want and fatigue, that the only service they could\r\nnow render was to walk on slowly with the sick and wounded soldiers\r\non their backs, for whom we were in great want of conveyance; and it\r\nwas highly pleasing to see the cheerfulness with which the troopers\r\nwalked by the side of their horses, while their distressed comrades\r\nof the infantry rode upon the march.”[30] The Mahratta cavalry\r\neffectually prevented the march being harassed by the enemy, from\r\nwhom they took some convoys and elephants.\r\n\r\nPending the completion of arrangements for another advance on\r\nSeringapatam, the Mahratta force withdrew northwards to Sara; the\r\nNizam’s force also withdrew to Gunjicotta, which, with several other\r\nsmall places, had been captured by a force of the Nizam’s.\r\n\r\nThe 19th Light Dragoons with the rest of the cavalry were sent, under\r\nFloyd, to the Carnatic, to recruit. The regiment reached Madras early\r\nin August; and, as horses to remount the cavalry were not procurable,\r\nthree native cavalry regiments were dismounted in order to complete\r\nthe horses required for the 19th. The 3rd and 5th Native cavalry had\r\ntheir ranks partially filled in the same way, so that by the end of\r\nthe monsoon these three Regiments were ready to rejoin the army.\r\n\r\n  “The 19th Light Dragoons, which under their gallant leader, had\r\n  made so powerful an impression on the minds of the enemy during\r\n  the war, was again completely remounted; and with the addition\r\n  of the draughts and recruits that had arrived from England, was\r\n  in nearly as great force as when it first took the field. This\r\n  favourite corps was reviewed by General Musgrave at the Mount\r\n  in the beginning of October, when it shewed near four hundred\r\n  mounted, both men and horses in perfect order.”[31]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the army at Bangalore was engaged in securing the passes\r\ninto the Carnatic, and in reducing the numerous hill fortresses\r\nthat abounded in Mysore. The most important of these, Nundydroog\r\nand Savandroog, were taken by assault on the 19th October and 21st\r\nDecember, respectively. Tippoo, on his side, had not been idle.\r\nIn the middle of June a large Mysore force invested Coimbatore,\r\nwhich was weakly held. The defence was obstinate, and after a two\r\nmonths’ siege the place was relieved from Palghat. In October, it\r\nwas invested a second time, and, the attempts to relieve it being\r\nunsuccessful, Coimbatore was forced to surrender, on 3rd November.\r\nSeveral parties of Mysore horse also succeeded in making raids into\r\nthe Carnatic, doing much mischief. One party penetrated to within\r\na few miles of Madras, early in January, after the cavalry had\r\nmarched to rejoin Cornwallis, and carried off much plunder. During\r\nthe preceding half century, the country within fifty miles of Madras\r\nhad been the constant scene of warlike operations. In that period,\r\nMadras had fallen to a French attack, and been held by them for four\r\nyears. Again, it had been frequently threatened and once besieged,\r\nby France, and Hyder had dictated a peace within sight of Fort St.\r\nGeorge. Too often, the inhabitants of Madras had heard the sound\r\nof an enemy’s guns, and seen the sky red with the glare of burning\r\nvillages: and now again the horsemen of Mysore were plundering and\r\nburning within sight of the Mount. But it was for the last time.\r\nShevtamodoo was plundered and burned by one of these parties.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, large convoys of supplies and material were being\r\nforwarded to Bangalore, the last and most important, conveying\r\nall the ammunition for the army, being escorted by the 19th Light\r\nDragoons under Colonel Floyd. Ascending by the Pednaikdirgum Pass,\r\non the 23rd December, and marching by Kolar, Ooscotta and Bangalore,\r\nhe joined Cornwallis at Magre, near Ootradroog, on the 12th January\r\n1792. Everything was now ready for an advance on Seringapatam,\r\nand the army was in a more efficient state than it had been at\r\nany time since the war began. Owing to Lord Cornwallis’ excellent\r\narrangements, supplies of all sorts were in the greatest abundance.\r\nThe only deficiency was in horses for the Cavalry. The losses\r\nexperienced in this respect, in the previous year, had not been made\r\ngood, and this arm of the service was represented only by the 19th\r\nLight Dragoons, six troops, the 3rd Native Cavalry, six troops,\r\nthe 5th Native Cavalry, four troops, and the Body Guards of Lord\r\nCornwallis and General Medows, one troop each. The force altogether\r\nconsisted of 22,033 men, of which about 15,500 were infantry. The\r\nadvance was still delayed by the absence of the Nizam’s force, which\r\nwas occupied in the siege of Gurramconda. On the 25th January it\r\narrived, under the command of the Nizam’s son, Secunder Jah. Part of\r\nthe Mahratta contingent, under Hari Punt, had already joined Lord\r\nCornwallis, but the greater part, under Pareshram Bhow, had gone off\r\non a plundering expedition to the northwestward, in defiance of the\r\nagreement made six months before. It did not join the British force,\r\ntill the campaign was over.\r\n\r\nThe Bombay army, under Abercromby, consisting of eight thousand four\r\nhundred men, was also on the march from the westward. Ascending by\r\nthe Poodicherim Pass, Abercromby directed his march by Periapatam\r\nand Eratoor, so as to join hands with Cornwallis in front of\r\nSeringapatam.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st January, Cornwallis held a review of his whole force\r\nat Hooliadroog, for the benefit of his allies. As the Nizam’s son\r\nreached the right of the line “a salute of 21 guns was fired from the\r\npark, while the cavalry, with drawn swords and trumpets sounding,\r\nreceived him with due honours as he passed their front. He returned\r\nthe officers’ salute, and looked attentively at the troops. The 19th\r\nDragoons, of which they had all heard, attracted their particular\r\nnotice.”[32] On the following day, the army marched, and encamped\r\nwithin sight of Seringapatam, at about seven miles’ distance, on the\r\n5th February. No opposition on the march was experienced.\r\n\r\nSeringapatam is situated on an island in the Cauvery river, four\r\nmiles in length and a mile and a half broad. At the western end of\r\nthe island was the fortress, the eastern portion being also strongly\r\ndefended by connected batteries and redoubts. On the north side, on\r\nwhat may be called the main land, was an oblong space about three\r\nmiles in length, enclosed by a hedge of cactus and other thorny\r\nplants, and commanded by redoubts on the highest points. In this\r\nspace Tippoo was encamped. He believed that he could protract the\r\ndefence, till the coming of the monsoon and the scarcity of supplies\r\nshould force Cornwallis to raise the siege; he further believed that\r\nno serious attack would be made on the position, till the arrival\r\nof Abercromby’s force. But Cornwallis had plans of a very different\r\nnature. The 6th being spent in reconnoitring, orders were issued,\r\nabout sunset, for the troops to parade at once for a night attack.\r\nAbout 8 o’clock all was ready, and the infantry advanced in three\r\ncolumns, the centre column being headed by Cornwallis in person. The\r\ncavalry were left to guard the camp, and the artillery were left\r\nbehind also. When all was ready, Cornwallis sent word of his plans to\r\nhis native allies, who were dismayed at hearing of an advance against\r\na fortified camp without artillery, and that his lordship should have\r\ngone to fight “like a common soldier.” Moving in silence, the heads\r\nof the columns, which were more than a mile apart, came in touch with\r\nthe enemy about half past ten. The attack was completely successful.\r\nOne redoubt after another was carried, Tippoo’s camp was taken, some\r\nof the troops, in their ardour, crossing the stream and penetrating\r\nto the farther side of the island. The brunt of the fighting fell on\r\nthe centre column, which, towards daylight, was heavily attacked by\r\nthe Mysore troops, who had recovered from their first surprise. The\r\nfighting continued till five o’clock in the afternoon of the 7th, the\r\nlast serious attack being headed by Tippoo’s French regiment. But\r\nnothing availed to dislodge the British troops from the positions\r\nthey had gained, and Tippoo was forced to withdraw on to the island,\r\nwhere also our troops had made good their footing. Our loss amounted\r\nto 535 of all ranks, killed, wounded and missing. Eighty guns and\r\nan enormous quantity of supplies were captured. The enemy’s loss\r\nwas estimated at four thousand killed, great numbers having been\r\nforced into the river and drowned. Greater still was the loss caused\r\nby desertion; numbers of the enemy having taken advantage of the\r\nconfusion, to throw down their arms and make off to their homes.\r\nThe whole loss to the Sultan, in killed, wounded and missing, was\r\nestimated at twenty thousand men.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th, the cavalry under Floyd were detached to meet\r\nAbercromby, with whom he effected a junction on the 14th. In a\r\nprivate letter, still extant, he writes:--\r\n\r\n  “On the 11th February I convoyed 13,000 Brinjarries (Brinjara\r\n  bullocks carrying grain) into camp. On the 12th February, I was\r\n  detached with nine squadrons, one battalion of sepoys, and about\r\n  1500 allied horse, to meet General Abercromby, and his army.\r\n\r\n  On the 14th of February, I was attacked by full 4000 of the\r\n  enemy’s horse, who had got in among my baggage, and attached\r\n  themselves to my allied horse. I soon recovered every article\r\n  of my baggage, but was forced to stop there, not being able to\r\n  distinguish friend from foe. The Nizam’s Horse under a son of\r\n  the Nawab of Canoul, and the Mahratta Horse also kept firm. The\r\n  enemy drew off, rather worsted by the allied horse. Immediately,\r\n  the head of Abercromby’s column appeared at a distance, and the\r\n  enemy made for them. I posted my battalion, my allied horse, and\r\n  my baggage, and ranged along between the enemy and Abercromby’s\r\n  with the nine squadrons of our own horse; the enemy collected and\r\n  went clear off.”\r\n\r\nDirom, the principal chronicler of the campaign, says:--\r\n\r\n  “Tippoo had meant a more serious opposition to this junction,\r\n  and for that purpose had detached the whole of his cavalry on\r\n  the evening of the 13th; they had crossed (the Cauvery) a few\r\n  miles above the fort, and lay in wait till Colonel Floyd moved in\r\n  the morning of the 14th. The detachment of allies, in spite of\r\n  the Colonel’s orders, and the remonstrance of Major Scott, who\r\n  was sent with them, remained loitering on the ground for some\r\n  time after the Colonel had marched: the Sultan’s horse seized\r\n  the opportunity, and attacked them with great vigour. They stood\r\n  their ground for some time, and then retreating towards Colonel\r\n  Floyd, he returned to support them, and soon put the enemy to the\r\n  rout.”\r\n\r\nOn the 16th, Abercromby joined Cornwallis on the north side of\r\nSeringapatam, without further hindrance, and preparations were made\r\nfor prosecuting the siege. On the 19th, Abercromby made a detour,\r\nand, crossing the Cauvery, invested the place from the south. A\r\nstrong Brigade, under Colonel Stuart, was entrenched on the island,\r\nand Floyd with the Cavalry was stationed about four thousand yards\r\nto the eastward, linking up the distance between Cornwallis and\r\nAbercromby. Seringapatam was completely invested. On the 22nd,\r\nan attack on Abercromby’s force was repulsed with loss, and then\r\nTippoo, who had been for some days in negotiation with Cornwallis,\r\nrealised that the time for surrender had arrived. The losses he had\r\nexperienced in the fighting of the 6th and 7th, rendered prolonged\r\nresistance impossible.\r\n\r\nIt was no part of Lord Cornwallis’ policy to destroy the Mysore\r\nState, but the disposition of Tippoo, “a faithless and violent\r\ncharacter on whom no dependence could be placed” required that his\r\npower should be so far curtailed, as to render him less dangerous. On\r\nthe 23rd February, the preliminaries of peace were signed by Tippoo,\r\nand warlike operations ceased, much to the disgust of the army,\r\nwhose minds were inflamed to an extraordinary degree against the\r\nSultan, on account of the barbarous cruelties inflicted by him on all\r\nprisoners that fell into his hands. One of the stipulations was that\r\ntwo of Tippoo’s sons should be handed over, as hostages for the due\r\nperformance of the treaty of peace. On the 26th, the young princes\r\nwere received by Lord Cornwallis with much ceremony. The occasion\r\nseems to have made a great impression at the time. Three,[33] if not\r\nmore, pictures of the event were painted by A. W. Devis, a well-known\r\nartist, who was present. In all of them, Colonel Floyd is prominently\r\nrepresented, a fine martial figure. Cornet Hale and Captain Child of\r\nthe 19th Light Dragoons also appear in some of the pictures. This\r\nwas evidently regarded in India as the most striking event in Lord\r\nCornwallis’ career in the country. The base of the statue erected to\r\nhim in Madras, has another representation of the scene.\r\n\r\nThe Princes remained in British territory till March 1794, when they\r\nwere sent back to the Sultan with all honour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OFFICER OF THE XIX^{TH} LIGHT DRAGOONS, 1792.\r\n\r\n  _to face p. 99._]\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of prize money gained during the war was\r\nfurther enhanced by the surrender of their respective shares by Lord\r\nCornwallis and General Medows, and by liberal gratuities from the\r\nGovernment. The share of every private soldier amounted to £14, 11.\r\n9., the shares of other ranks being in proportion.\r\n\r\nSixty-seven forts and eight hundred and one guns were captured during\r\nthe three campaigns; of which, fifty-six forts and six hundred and\r\nfifty-six guns were captured by the British forces, the remainder\r\nfalling to their native allies.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th March, the Treaty of Peace was duly ratified, and on\r\nthe 26th, the army marched from Seringapatam, for Madras, which was\r\nreached about the end of May. The 19th Light Dragoons returned to\r\ntheir old quarters at Shevtamodoo.\r\n\r\nA medal for the three campaigns, 1790-92, was bestowed on the Bengal\r\nnative troops who took part in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nFALL OF MYSORE\r\n\r\n1793-1799.\r\n\r\n  France declares War--Expedition against Pondicherry--Surrender\r\n  of Pondicherry--Peace reigns in India--Lunkia Naik--Floyd’s\r\n  large allowances--French adventurers in India--Tippoo’s\r\n  growing hostility--Disarmament of Nizam’s force under\r\n  French officers--Army formed under General Harris--Tippoo’s\r\n  intrigues--Galloper Guns--Advance on Mysore--Battle of\r\n  Mallavelly--Seringapatam invested--The Bombay Army--The Rajah\r\n  of Coorg--Signal guns--Seringapatam taken--Tardy recognition in\r\n  England of services performed in India--Badge of “Seringapatam.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 1st February 1793, the French National Convention declared war\r\nagainst Great Britain. The news was at once dispatched to India by\r\nthe British Consul at Alexandria, and reached Calcutta on the 11th\r\nJune. Lord Cornwallis acted with great promptitude, and, without\r\nawaiting further communications from England, issued orders for\r\ntaking possession of the French territories in India. The troops in\r\nthe vicinity of Wallajabad, among whom were the 19th Light Dragoons,\r\nwere at once put in motion under Colonel Floyd, and encamped before\r\nPondicherry on the 11th July, while the place was blockaded by sea by\r\nsuch ships as were available. On the 28th July, Colonel Brathwaite,\r\nwho had succeeded Major General Medows as local Commander in Chief,\r\ntook command of the force, which by this time amounted to 10,500\r\nmen. According to the returns of 1st August, the strength of the\r\n19th Light Dragoons, at that date, was 274, exclusive of sick. Siege\r\noperations were commenced on the 10th August, and fire was opened\r\non the 20th. On the 22nd Pondicherry capitulated, and was taken\r\npossession of on the following day. The British loss amounted to 248\r\nkilled, wounded, and missing. One hundred and sixty-six guns, with a\r\ngreat quantity of military stores, fell into the hands of our troops,\r\nand Pondicherry ceased to be a French possession until the Peace of\r\nAmiens. The part taken in the siege by the cavalry was naturally a\r\nsubordinate one, as the enemy had no force in the field that could\r\ninterrupt operations.\r\n\r\nOn the fall of Pondicherry, the 19th Light Dragoons returned for a\r\ntime to their old quarters at Shevtamodoo. Colonel Floyd remained\r\nat Pondicherry, in command of the place, for a few months, when he\r\nwas appointed to command the Southern Division of the Madras forces,\r\nwith his Head Quarters at Trichinopoly. In 1794, we find the 19th\r\nquartered at Seringham, near Trichinopoly. In the following year,\r\nthey were encamped on the Trichinopoly plain, and in 1796, they were\r\nmoved into the cavalry cantonments at Trichinopoly.\r\n\r\nFor five years the war was confined to Europe. The French flag was\r\nnot seen on the coasts of India, nor was any Frenchman in arms, with\r\nthe exception of those in the service of Native States, to be found\r\nin the country. While war raged in Europe, the peace of India was\r\npractically undisturbed. In the beginning of June 1795, a detachment\r\nof the 19th was employed in the capture of an insurgent Polygar\r\nchief, named Lunkia Naik, under the following circumstances. On the\r\nnight of the 7th June, Lieutenant Oliphant, with a detachment of\r\ntwo native officers and twenty-two sepoys, surprised and captured\r\nLunkia Naik, at Manapur, about twenty-four miles from Trichinopoly.\r\nThe Chief’s retainers gathered to the rescue in large numbers, and\r\nattacked Oliphant, who had retired with his prisoner into a Choultry,\r\nwhere he defended himself for nine hours, repelling several assaults.\r\nThe following morning, two troops of the 19th appeared, drove off the\r\nassailants, and brought Oliphant’s detachment back to Trichinopoly,\r\nwith Lunkia Naik securely tied to a trooper.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1796, the 25th Light Dragoons landed in Madras\r\nfrom England.\r\n\r\nIn his first regimental order to the regiment, when it was raised,\r\nSir John Burgoyne took occasion to point out that service in India\r\nwas “not less honourable than lucrative.” There could be no doubt on\r\nthe latter point, so far as the senior officers were concerned. The\r\nadvantages given to the King’s officers in point of rank over the\r\nCompany’s officers, had the intended effect of throwing most of the\r\nchief commands into their hands, and the allowances that were granted\r\nin some cases, showed how strong a shake they were able to give to\r\nthe “pagoda tree.” Lieutenant Colonel Stapleton Cotton (afterwards\r\nLord Combermere) in a letter from Madras in January 1797, wrote--\r\n\r\n  “As the command of a station is everything here ... I am very\r\n  desirous of getting the rank of Colonel, which would ensure a\r\n  command. An officer commanding at any station receives full\r\n  batta, which, if a Colonel, is very considerable. I now only\r\n  receive half batta, as a Lieutenant Colonel, and my King’s pay.\r\n  On the Bengal establishment every officer receives full batta,\r\n  and the Commanding Officer double full batta. A Bengal command is\r\n  a sure fortune in five years. General Floyd is now (including his\r\n  King’s pay as Major General and Lieutenant Colonel of the 19th\r\n  Light Dragoons, his Company’s pay, and his allowance from the\r\n  Company and the Nizam as Commandant of the Southern District) in\r\n  the receipt of from £14,000 to £16,000.”\r\n\r\nEvents were in progress, that were, before long, destined to bring\r\nthe British armies in India into the field again. British authority\r\nin India was menaced by French hostility in a peculiarly subtle and\r\ndangerous form. The memory of his defeats and losses in 1792, had\r\nlong rankled in Tippoo’s mind, and his animosity against the English\r\nwas inflamed by the numerous French officers in his employ, through\r\nwhom he maintained informal relations with France. In Hyderabad,\r\nthere was a fairly disciplined force of 14,000 infantry, with an\r\nadequate proportion of artillery, commanded by French officers in\r\nthe Nizam’s service, who flew the tricolour flag, and were in secret\r\ncorrespondence with Tippoo. In upper India, Scindia’s disciplined\r\nbattalions were also commanded by a French officer. Fortunately, the\r\nMahrattas were at this time too much occupied with their own quarrels\r\nto meddle with affairs in the South. The news of French successes,\r\nunder Bonaparte, induced Tippoo to believe that the time had arrived\r\nto strike a blow against the English.\r\n\r\nIn March 1796, he dispatched an embassy to Cabul, inviting Zeman\r\nShah to invade India, conquer Delhi, and join hands with him in\r\ndestroying the British, the Portuguese, the Mahrattas, and the\r\nNizam. In the following year, Tippoo despatched ambassadors to the\r\nMauritius, proposing an offensive and defensive alliance against\r\nthe English, and asking for a French force, which he engaged to pay\r\nand to furnish with all necessary supplies. But the Governor of the\r\nMauritius had no troops to spare, and could only send under 100 men,\r\namong whom were several officers and artificers, who landed in India\r\nin April 1798. A few weeks later, Tippoo despatched an embassy to\r\nParis. In May 1798, Lord Mornington, afterwards known as the Marquis\r\nof Wellesley, arrived in India to take up the office of Governor\r\nGeneral, and Tippoo’s dealings with the French became known, a\r\nfew days after his arrival. It was known also that a great French\r\nexpedition was preparing in the Mediterranean, which was believed\r\nto be aimed at Egypt, as in fact it was. The times were critical,\r\nand demanded prompt action: the new Governor General was not the\r\nman to waste time, when action was required. The first move made\r\nby Lord Mornington was to break up the force at Hyderabad, which\r\nfor the moment was the most dangerous factor in the situation. The\r\nNizam and his ministers were loyal to the British alliance, but the\r\nFrench officers present had become possessed of so much influence,\r\nthat the Hyderabad Government had lost control of them, while their\r\narrogance and overbearing conduct filled the Nizam and his ministers\r\nwith alarm. The Nizam therefore willingly entered into a Treaty\r\nengaging himself to get rid of his French officers, and to break up\r\nthe formidable body they had created. By dexterous measures, and\r\nby taking advantage of a mutiny that occurred in the force, it was\r\nsurrounded and disarmed without bloodshed, on 22nd October. One\r\nhundred and twenty-four French officers, whose lives were at the\r\ntime in danger from their own men, were removed and shipped off to\r\nCalcutta, and a serious danger successfully averted.[34] Four days\r\nbefore this occurrence, intelligence of the invasion of Egypt by\r\nBonaparte reached Calcutta. Meanwhile, by way of precaution against a\r\nsudden blow from Tippoo, a force was collected at Wallajabad, among\r\nwhich was the 19th Light Dragoons, who marched from Trichinopoly at\r\nthe beginning of August. From Wallajabad the regiment was moved to\r\nMadras; their muster roll, dated 20th September, shows that they\r\nwere cantoned at the Mount on that date. The effective strength of\r\nthe regiment, then present, was 361 of all ranks; of whom 12 were\r\nrecruits recently received from England, and 30 were volunteers\r\nfrom the 12th, 19th, 73rd, and 74th Regiments. So valuable were\r\nEuropean Cavalry, that on the bare prospect of war their numbers were\r\nat once filled up from the Infantry. The dispersal of the French\r\nContingent at Hyderabad having been accomplished, Lord Mornington\r\naddressed Tippoo with regard to his dealings with the French\r\nGovernment. Preparations were at the same time made for an advance\r\non Seringapatam from the Bombay coast, while the Madras forces\r\nassembled at Vellore. Tippoo’s replies were evasive. His object was\r\nto gain time, till the arrival of the expected French force. Delay\r\nwas dangerous, and it was evident that further negotiations could\r\nlead to no good result, so, early in February 1799, the advance of\r\nthe army was determined on. Meanwhile, Shah Zeman had reached Lahore,\r\nand, though he was unable to advance farther south, and was forced to\r\nreturn to Cabul, on account of his own territories being invaded by\r\nPersia, his presence in the Punjab necessitated the preparation of a\r\nBritish force in the North, to hold him in check.\r\n\r\nUp till this time the artillery of the British Army in India was\r\nentirely drawn by bullocks. An attempt to furnish artillery of\r\ngreater mobility was now made. While the army lay at Vellore, an\r\norder was issued for attaching to each regiment of European dragoons\r\nand native Cavalry two 6 Pr. guns, in order to increase their\r\nindependent action.\r\n\r\n  “The plan adopted by Government for attaching flying artillery\r\n  to the cavalry corps having been communicated to the heads of\r\n  regiments respectively, the Commander in Chief is now pleased\r\n  to direct that the detail of European artillery and gun lascars\r\n  to be attached to each regiment be sent to the several corps\r\n  from the 1st and 2nd battalions of artillery agreeably to the\r\n  following arrangements, viz: 1 Lieutenant Fireworker, 1 Serjeant,\r\n  1 Corporal, 1 Syrang, 2 Second Tindals and 20 Lascars for each\r\n  regiment of European dragoons, and 1 Serjeant, 1 Gunner, 1 First\r\n  Tindal, and 18 Lascars for each regiment of native Cavalry.\r\n  (G.O.C.C. 13th January 1799).”[35]\r\n\r\nLittle mention of these guns is anywhere made during the ensuing\r\ncampaign, though their efficiency on subsequent occasions is\r\nfrequently mentioned. Thorn, the historian of the Mahratta War,\r\nwriting four years later of the formation of the army under the\r\nCommander in Chief, says:--\r\n\r\n  “Among the different military improvements practised on these\r\n  occasions, the use of the galloper guns was one of the most\r\n  important, as afterwards appeared in the terror which they\r\n  produced on the Mahratta horse. Two of these guns, of six\r\n  pounders, were attached to each regiment; and nothing could\r\n  exceed the celerity and exactness of the manœuvres made with them\r\n  at full speed by this large body of cavalry &c. &c.”[36]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the good service done by the galloper guns on many\r\noccasions, difficulties as to their control in the field frequently\r\narose, after the formation of a corps of artillery drawn by horses,\r\nin 1805, owing to their not having formed an integral part of the\r\nRegiment they were attached to.\r\n\r\nAt first the guns closely attended their regiment, in action,\r\nseconding its efforts with their fire when possible. In line of\r\nbattle they were placed in pairs, in the intervals between different\r\ncorps. After a time this system was discontinued, and the guns were\r\nbrigaded together under command of a Cavalry officer, or they were\r\nbrigaded with Artillery guns, in which case difficulties arose as to\r\ntheir command. In 1815, it was ordered that, whenever galloper guns\r\nwere brigaded, they should be commanded by an Artillery officer. But\r\ncomplaints were made that the want of uniform training rendered them\r\nunfit to be brigaded with Horse Artillery guns, and they were finally\r\nabolished in May 1819.\r\n\r\nThe 19th Light Dragoons, taking their galloper guns with them,\r\nas well as those for the 25th Light Dragoons and the 1st Native\r\nCavalry, marched from Madras on 23rd January, to join the army\r\nunder General Harris, which was assembled at Vellore to the number\r\nof nearly 21,000 men. On the 14th February, the whole force moved\r\nforward. The Cavalry under Major General Floyd comprised the 19th,\r\n430 strong, the 25th Dragoons, and four Regiments of Native Cavalry:\r\n2635 sabres in all, divided into two Brigades. On the 20th, the army\r\nwas joined by 16,000 men from Hyderabad, about 10,000 of which were\r\nthe contingent furnished by the Nizam, who, throughout the campaign,\r\nco-operated most heartily with the British Commander. The command of\r\nthe Nizam’s Contingent was given to Colonel the Honourable Arthur\r\nWellesley,[37] who had with him also his own regiment, the 33rd\r\nFoot. Simultaneously, the force from Bombay consisting of 6400 men\r\nunder Lieutenant General Stuart,[38] advanced from Cannanore, and, on\r\n2nd March, encamped on the Mysore frontier, near Periapatam.\r\n\r\nMarching by Rycottah, General Harris crossed the Mysore frontier\r\non 5th, and directed his march northwards, as if for the purpose\r\nof attacking Bangalore. When in sight of that place he turned\r\nsouthwards, and encamped five miles from Mallavelly, on the 26th\r\nMarch. Meanwhile, Tippoo had not been idle. On the 6th, he crossed\r\nthe frontier near Periapatam, and attempted to cut off a detached\r\nBrigade of the Bombay force at Sedaseer. In spite of his great\r\nnumerical superiority, the attack was repulsed with heavy loss,\r\nand Tippoo withdrew to Seringapatam. He had between seventy and\r\neighty thousand men, about thirty thousand of which were in or near\r\nSeringapatam, the whole in a state of complete efficiency.\r\n\r\nAs General Harris’ force approached their camping ground, on the\r\n26th, the Cavalry found themselves confronted by a large body of\r\nthe enemy commanded by Tippoo in person. As the Infantry closed\r\nup, the Sultan slowly moved off, and the British force encamped\r\nwithin sight of the enemy, who withdrew towards Mallavelly. At\r\ndaybreak, on the 27th, the army marched on Mallavelly, while the\r\nNizam’s contingent under Wellesley moved parallel to it, on the\r\nleft, enclosing the baggage between the two bodies. The front was\r\ncovered by Major General Floyd with five regiments of Cavalry. On\r\napproaching Mallavelly, the heights beyond the village were seen\r\nto be occupied by infantry, while a large force of cavalry were on\r\nthe British right. Wellesley’s division was directed to attack the\r\nenemy’s right, supported by Floyd and his cavalry, while the right\r\nwing of the army entered Mallavelly, and attacked the enemy’s centre.\r\nAs the force advanced, the enemy drew back, as though declining an\r\naction, and preparations were made by the British troops for marking\r\nout a new encampment. While this was in progress, the enemy suddenly\r\nopened fire from twelve or fourteen guns, which did some execution.\r\nUpon this, the infantry picquets, the 25th Light Dragoons and a\r\nNative Cavalry Regiment pushed forward, and occupied a village in\r\nfront of the enemy’s left, in which was a party of the enemy’s horse\r\nand rocket men, while the rest of the army formed line of battle.\r\nIn the meanwhile, Colonel Wellesley’s division advanced, supported\r\nby Major General Floyd, with the 19th Light Dragoons, and 1st and\r\n3rd regiments of Native cavalry. As the British force advanced,\r\nnearly simultaneous attacks were made by the enemy on both flanks.\r\nOn the right a large body of cavalry hovered on the flanks, while\r\na smaller corps charged the 1st Brigade under Major General Baird.\r\nThe steady fire of the 12th Foot and the Scotch Brigade repulsed\r\nthem with considerable loss. On the left, a body of men, about 2000\r\nstrong, advanced in good order against the 33rd, till it was thrown\r\ninto confusion by a heavy fire at sixty paces’ distance. Seizing\r\nthe moment, Floyd charged with his three regiments of Cavalry, and\r\ncompletely routed them, taking six standards and sabreing many men.\r\n“Into them, with disciplined impetuosity, dashed General Floyd\r\nat the head of the old 19th Light Dragoons and two regiments of\r\nNative Cavalry, who in a few minutes sabred nearly the whole of\r\nthe fugitives.”[39] The retreat of the enemy became general, as\r\nthe advance of the British continued, and by two o’clock they had\r\ncompletely withdrawn from the field. After the action, the army\r\nreturned and camped near Mallavelly. This success was purchased with\r\na loss of only seven killed, fifty-three wounded and six missing.\r\nThe 19th Light Dragoons, which suffered the most among the Cavalry\r\nRegiments, had eight wounded, among them Captain Kennedy, three\r\nhorses killed, twenty-two wounded, and three missing. It is said\r\nthat, of the column charged by Major General Floyd, all but 230 were\r\nput _hors de combat_.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th and 30th, the army crossed the Cauvery at Sosilay. This\r\nmove was entirely unexpected by Tippoo, who had made up his mind\r\nthat the army would march directly on Seringapatam to attack it, as\r\nCornwallis had attacked it seven years before. In this belief, he had\r\nwasted the whole country in the vicinity on the north bank of the\r\nriver. By this adroit move General Harris was favourably situated to\r\njoin hands with the Bombay force on its arrival, while he was able\r\nto draw abundant supplies from the villages in his neighbourhood,\r\nand from the rich country in his rear, which Tippoo had preserved\r\nfor himself. Continuing his march westward, within five miles of\r\nSeringapatam, and watched, but not molested by Tippoo’s cavalry,\r\nGeneral Harris took up ground for the siege, on the 5th April,\r\nopposite the west face of the fort of Seringapatam, and at a distance\r\nof two miles from it. The left of the army rested on the river; the\r\ncavalry were encamped in the rear of the army.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th April at daybreak, Floyd with four regiments of Cavalry,\r\namong them the 19th Light Dragoons, six regiments of Infantry, twenty\r\nguns, and a corps of the Nizam’s horse, marched westward to join the\r\nBombay force under Major General Stuart. On the 8th, he established\r\ncommunication with Stuart, and on the 10th, the two forces were\r\nunited at Periapatam. During the whole march, Floyd’s force was\r\nclosely attended by the enemy’s cavalry, who were however unable to\r\nmake any impression.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah of Coorg, our constant and loyal ally, had accompanied\r\nMajor General Stuart to Periapatam, from which place he was to return\r\nto look after his own territories, and to arrange for forwarding\r\nsupplies to the army.\r\n\r\n  “His romantic character rendered him an object of peculiar\r\n  interest to General Floyd and the officers of the division\r\n  from the eastward; and a squadron of the 19th Dragoons sent as\r\n  an escort with General Stuart (the first European cavalry the\r\n  Rajah had ever seen) was a novelty at which he expressed his\r\n  admiration.... He accepted with enthusiasm the invitation to see\r\n  the line of the eastern division under arms, and was received\r\n  with suitable honours. He expressed a just admiration, but\r\n  continued after his return to General Floyd’s tent, to testify\r\n  his particular and unwearied admiration of the 19th regiment,\r\n  intimating a wish to procure at a proper time for his own\r\n  personal use, one of the dragoon’s swords.... On his rising to\r\n  take leave General Floyd unclasped his own sword, and in a few\r\n  words judiciously suited to the occasion, begged that he might be\r\n  permitted to present it for the Rajah’s use.”[40]\r\n\r\nAt half-past seven in the evening of the 13th, Floyd’s signal guns\r\nwere heard in General Harris’ camp, and were answered ten minutes\r\nlater to show that they were understood.[41] Twenty-four hours later,\r\nthe united forces of Floyd and Stuart joined General Harris in front\r\nof Seringapatam. On the same date letters reached the army from the\r\nGovernor General congratulating them on the success at Mallavelly.\r\nThese letters were brought by a native messenger, written on a very\r\nnarrow slip of paper, and sealed up in a quill. This was the general\r\nmethod of communication, public and private, as would appear from the\r\nfollowing notice in the _Calcutta Gazette_.\r\n\r\n  _Fort William, Public Department, 10th April 1799._\r\n\r\n  “Notice is hereby given that all letters, whether public or\r\n  private, for the Grand Army in the Field, are in future to be\r\n  limited to a small slip of paper not exceeding one eighth of a\r\n  sheet of quarter-post, rolled (not folded up), which restriction\r\n  will continue until further notice.”\r\n\r\nSome of these notes, 2 inches wide by 6⅜ inches long, are still in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nSome solicitude was experienced at this time concerning supplies,\r\nand the cavalry were busily employed in protecting and bringing in\r\nconvoys. On the 16th, Floyd, with five regiments of cavalry and the\r\nleft wing of the army, brought in a party of Brinjarries who had been\r\nsent out to the southward to collect cattle and grain. On the 19th,\r\nFloyd marched again with the whole of the regular cavalry, a brigade\r\nof infantry, and the Nizam’s cavalry, towards the Coveripoorum Pass,\r\nfor the purpose of protecting two large convoys of provisions en\r\nroute from Coimbatore and the Baramahal. On the 30th, he was joined\r\nby the convoy from Rykottah, at the head of the Pass, but it was\r\nnot till the 6th May that the Coimbatore convoy arrived, and on the\r\n11th, the whole returned to Seringapatam bringing with them forty\r\nthousand bullocks, most of which carried loads of grain, twenty-one\r\nthousand nine hundred sheep and other necessaries, thus placing the\r\nsubsistence of the army out of danger for many days.\r\n\r\nBut the campaign was already at an end. A practicable breach having\r\nbeen made, at one o’clock on the 4th May, Seringapatam was stormed\r\nby the British troops, and after two hours’ desperate fighting the\r\nBritish colours were planted in the fortress. Tippoo’s dead body was\r\nfound at night under a heap of slain, the short-lived Mahommedan\r\nKingdom of Mysore was at an end, and the most imminent menace to\r\nBritish rule in India was averted. This gallant feat of arms cost the\r\nBritish force a loss of 367 in killed, wounded, and missing, of whom\r\n321 were Europeans. Nine hundred and twenty-nine guns and an enormous\r\nquantity of warlike material fell into the hands of the victors. The\r\nFrench officers found in Seringapatam had commissions from the French\r\nGovernment. By Tippoo’s orders, all the European prisoners who fell\r\ninto his hands during the siege had been barbarously put to death.\r\nA number of prisoners also, who had fallen into his hands in former\r\nwars, and who had been detained, in breach of agreements in 1784 and\r\n1792, were massacred by his orders at the commencement of hostilities.\r\n\r\nIn an order published after the siege, General Harris thus spoke of\r\nthe Cavalry Division:--\r\n\r\n  “The advantage derived from the exertions of the Cavalry upon\r\n  every occasion, although opposed by such superior numbers on the\r\n  part of the enemy, are so important, as to give this corps the\r\n  strongest claims to the warmest approbation of the Commander in\r\n  Chief, which he requests Major General Floyd will take an early\r\n  occasion of conveying to them.”\r\n\r\nThe 19th Light Dragoons remained in Mysore during the settlement of\r\nthe country, in the course of which the representative of the old\r\nruling family was replaced on the Mysore throne. On the 13th November\r\nthey parted from Wellesley at Ooscottah, and marched for Vellore, and\r\nso back to their old quarters at Trichinopoly, which they reached\r\nabout the end of the year.\r\n\r\nGreat reluctance appears to have been felt by the Government in\r\nEngland, to treat services performed under the East India Company as\r\nworthy of recognition by the Crown. The Court of Directors issued a\r\nmedal in 1808 to the officers and men of the King’s and Company’s\r\ntroops who had taken part in the operations in Mysore, but the royal\r\npermission for the King’s troops to wear the medal in England was\r\nnot granted till 1815, in which year General Harris was raised to\r\nthe peerage for his services in 1799. In 1818 his lordship made a\r\nspecial representation for some permanent badge to be bestowed on the\r\nregiments concerned, when permission to bear the word “Seringapatam”\r\non colours and appointments was granted.\r\n\r\n      HORSE GUARDS,\r\n      _24th June 1818_.\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\n  I have the honour to acquaint you, that His Royal Highness the\r\n  Prince Regent, in the Name and on the Behalf of His Majesty\r\n  has been pleased to approve of the 19th Regiment of Light\r\n  Dragoons (Lancers) being permitted to bear on its Colours and\r\n  Appointments, in addition to any other Badges or Devices which\r\n  may have heretofore been granted to the Regiment, the Word\r\n  “Seringapatam,” in commemoration of the distinguished gallantry\r\n  displayed by the Regiment in the Storming and Capture of\r\n  Seringapatam, in the month of May 1799.\r\n\r\n  I have &c.\r\n\r\n      HARRY CALVERT\r\n      A. G.\r\n\r\n  M. General\r\n  Sir J. O. VANDELEUR, K.C.B.\r\n  Colonel of the 19th Lancers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nDHOONDIA WAO\r\n\r\n1800-1802\r\n\r\n  Floyd leaves 19th--Dhoondia Wao--Force formed under Colonel\r\n  Wellesley to capture him--Advance on Ranee Bednore--Capture of\r\n  Koondgul, Dummul, Gudduck--Division of Dhoondia’s force destroyed\r\n  at Manoli--Dhoondia doubles back--Again hemmed in--Dhoondia\r\n  crosses Malpurba river--Pursuit drawing to a close--Dhoondia\r\n  caught at Conaghul--Dhoondia killed, and his force\r\n  destroyed--19th return to Mysore--The Rajah of Bullum--Regiment\r\n  ordered to Arcot.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor nearly nineteen years, ever since the regiment had existed,\r\nthe 19th Light Dragoons had served under Major General Floyd in\r\nquarters and in the field, and now the time had come for separation.\r\nIn January 1800, Floyd sailed for England, the last of the officers\r\noriginally appointed to the regiment. Soon after his arrival in\r\nEngland, he was appointed Colonel of the 26th Light Dragoons, and\r\nhis connection with his old regiment was permanently severed.\r\nHe afterwards become Colonel of the 8th Light Dragoons, and was\r\nappointed Governor of Gravesend and Tilbury. He maintained his\r\ninterest in everything calculated to improve our cavalry system to\r\nthe end of his life. A General Order from the Adjutant General’s\r\noffice in Dublin, dated 7th October 1811, contains a Riding Lesson,\r\n“suggested by Lieut. General Floyd,” which Officers Commanding\r\ncavalry regiments are directed to practise. It is the foundation of\r\nour present riding school system. In 1816, he was created a Baronet\r\nfor his services, and died at the age of 70, two years later.\r\n\r\nThe regiment did not remain long at Trichinopoly. It was soon called\r\non to take part in a short but remarkable campaign. When Seringapatam\r\nfell, there was a prisoner in Tippoo’s power, named Dhoondia Wao, a\r\nnoted freebooter, who had at one time been in the service of Hyder\r\nAli. During Lord Cornwallis’ campaign in 1791-92, he had deserted\r\nfrom the Mysore service. After the conclusion of peace, he collected\r\na party of desperate men, and committed depredations in the country\r\nround Dharwar. Being hard pressed on one occasion by the Peishwa’s\r\ntroops, he took refuge in Mysore territory, thinking to make his\r\npeace with Tippoo. On falling into Tippoo’s hands, he was forcibly\r\nconverted to Mohammedanism, and thrown into prison, where he remained\r\ntill Seringapatam fell. In the confusion consequent on the capture\r\nof the place, he was set at liberty by an officer who did not know\r\nhis character. He at once collected a number of Tippoo’s disbanded\r\nsoldiers, and made for the Bednore district. In the confusion\r\nconsequent on the overthrow of Tippoo’s power, he gained possession\r\nof many of the principal forts in the province. His adherents rapidly\r\nincreased in number, and he ravaged the surrounding country, his\r\nexactions being accompanied by acts of the most atrocious cruelty.\r\nBeing provided with artillery, ammunition and money, he asserted\r\nhis right to the Bednore province, and assumed the title of King of\r\nthe Two Worlds. It was the golden age of adventurers. Forty years\r\nearlier, Hyder Ali had founded a kingdom on the ruins of the ancient\r\nprincipality of Mysore. In the far north Runjeet Singh was founding\r\na Sikh State in the Punjab. Between the Ganges and the Jumna,\r\nPerron was aiming at forming a province under French protection.\r\nOn the borders of the Indian desert, Thomas, the Irish sailor, had\r\nestablished an independent principality in Hurrianah, while other\r\nadventurers like Ameer Khan and Ghuffoor Khan, the future founders of\r\nthe States of Tonk and Jowrah, traversed the centre of India at the\r\nhead of plundering hordes. Outside British territory was universal\r\nconfusion and anarchy, in which any man possessed of a bold heart and\r\na discerning brain might hope to carve out a Kingdom for himself,\r\nwhatever his faith or nationality. Any Chief whose service promised\r\nplenty of plunder could command a following, which in a few months of\r\nsuccessful enterprize might swell to the dimensions of an army. But\r\nDhoondia had neither the talents nor the opportunity to become more\r\nthan a brigand on an unusually large scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH MAP\r\n\r\nto illustrate the march of the Army in pursuit of Dhoondia Wao in\r\nJuly, August, and September 1800.\r\n\r\n  _Walker & Boutall sc._]\r\n\r\nEarly in July 1799, the Commander in Chief sent two flying columns\r\ninto the field against him, and the Head Quarters of the Army\r\nwere also moved northwards for the same purpose. Several forts in\r\nthe hands of Dhoondia’s men were taken by storm, a number of the\r\nfreebooters were killed in various encounters, and, on the 17th\r\nAugust, Dhoondia himself was defeated and forced to take refuge\r\nin the Peishwa’s territory. There he was attacked by one of the\r\nPeishwa’s officers named Dhoondia Punt Gokla, his elephants,\r\nbullocks, and guns captured, and his remaining followers dispersed.\r\nIt was thought that the last had been heard of Dhoondia Wao, but in a\r\nfew months he was in the field again with a larger force than ever.\r\nHaving been joined by the whole of Tippoo’s disbanded cavalry and a\r\nnumber of disaffected men from the Hyderabad country, he obtained\r\npossession of several places in the Southern Mahratta country, and\r\nthreatened to re-enter Mysore. Dhoondia’s head quarters were in what\r\nis now the Dharwar district, from whence he ravaged impartially the\r\nPeishwa’s and Nizam’s territories adjoining, as well as the newly\r\nconquered Mysore country under British administration. His belief, no\r\ndoubt, was that the three powers concerned would never act in unison,\r\nand that, if at any time he was hard pressed on one side, he would\r\nalways be able to secure a retreat by crossing into the adjoining\r\nterritory, where mutual jealousies would afford him a temporary\r\nasylum. A force of 5000 horse and a large body of infantry, sent\r\nagainst him by the Peishwa, was defeated. His adherents increased in\r\nnumbers, till it was found that he was at the head of 40,000 men, and\r\nbeyond the control of the feeble government of the Peishwa, in whose\r\nterritory he had established himself. Owing to these circumstances,\r\nin the beginning of May 1800, orders were sent to Colonel the Honble.\r\nA. Wellesley, who was in full civil and military charge of Mysore,\r\ndirecting him to assemble a field force, as speedily as possible,\r\nand pursue and destroy Dhoondia Wao’s forces wherever he should find\r\nthem. To prevent Dhoondia from again securing himself by taking\r\nrefuge in the Peishwa’s country, the consent of the Peishwa was\r\nobtained for the British troops to follow Dhoondia into Mahratta\r\nterritory, if necessary. The campaign was one of unusual character.\r\nThe task was not the subjugation and occupation of a particular\r\ntract of country, nor the coercion of an enemy with whom terms\r\nwere eventually to be made. The object in view was the extirpation\r\nof a band of freebooters, whose numbers had swelled to those of a\r\nformidable army, provided with artillery and ample resources, and who\r\nhad possessed themselves of a province belonging to a power with whom\r\nwe were in alliance. “You are to pursue Dhoondia Wao wherever you\r\nmay find him, and to hang him on the first tree.” So ran Wellesley’s\r\ninstructions. By the 24th June, Wellesley’s force, which assembled\r\nat Chitteldroog, had crossed the Toombadra river near Hurryhur,\r\nand on the 27th, it marched on Ranee Bednore. The force consisted\r\nof H.M.’s 19th and 25th Light Dragoons, three regiments of Native\r\nCavalry, two regiments of European Infantry, and five regiments of\r\nNative Infantry. A detachment of the Hyderabad Subsidiary Force,\r\nbetween three and four thousand strong, co-operated under Lieut.\r\nColonel Bowser: the Peishwa also sent a force to assist, acting\r\nindependently. A body of the Nizam’s horse also joined Wellesley’s\r\nforce. On reaching Ranee Bednore, the advanced guard was fired on:\r\nthe fort was at once attacked and carried by escalade, and Dhoondia’s\r\ngarrison, about 500 in number, put to the sword. So atrocious had\r\nbeen the cruelties committed by Dhoondia’s men, that quarter was\r\nseldom given to any of them found in arms. The next few days were\r\nspent in clearing the neighbourhood of Dhoondia’s partisans, and in\r\nobtaining supplies, Wellesley then moved to Deogheri, where four\r\ndays were spent in making a bridge across the Werdah river, and\r\nconstructing a small redoubt to protect it. Meanwhile, a disaster\r\nhad occurred to the northward. Dhoondia Punt Gokla, the Mahratta\r\nChief who had inflicted a defeat on Dhoondia Wao the previous year,\r\nwas at Kittoor, with 10,000 horse, 5000 foot and eight guns, for the\r\npurpose of co-operating with the British. He was suddenly attacked\r\nby Dhoondia Wao on 30th June, his guns taken, his force routed, and\r\nhimself killed.\r\n\r\nWellesley, having crossed the Werdah river, marched to Savanoor on\r\nthe 12th July, leaving a small detachment to protect the bridge.\r\nThe plan Wellesley had in his mind, and which he eventually carried\r\nout, begins to appear. It was to seize all fortified places in\r\nDhoondia’s hands, and, if he still remained in arms, gradually\r\ndrive him eastwards into one of the narrow angles formed by the\r\nKistna, Toombadra and other rivers, and destroy him. It was the\r\ntime of full monsoon, and the rivers could only be crossed by the\r\naid of boats, which were difficult to procure. If Dhoondia was kept\r\nconstantly on the move, he would be unable to make them. At Savanoor,\r\nWellesley received news that Dhoondia was advancing to attack him.\r\nHe accordingly took up a position in front of the town. Dhoondia\r\nreconnoitred the position, and retreated, without attacking, to\r\nKoondgul. Wellesley followed him, and, reaching that place after a\r\ntwenty-two mile march, and after the troops had been above twelve\r\nhours under arms, carried it by escalade on the same day. But\r\nDhoondia had gone on, leaving only a garrison of 600 men behind him.\r\nOn the 16th, Wellesley relieved Sirhetty which was being besieged by\r\none of Dhoondia’s adherents, and then returned to Savanoor for the\r\nbaggage and stores he had left behind there in his rapid advance.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th, Wellesley was joined at Savanoor by the Mahratta Cavalry\r\nthat had been so roughly handled on the 30th June, when Dhoondia\r\nPunt Gokla was killed, and on the 22nd, he moved in the direction of\r\nDummul, where the King of the Two Worlds was said to be. Dhoondia\r\nhad however moved off, leaving a garrison of 1000 men in the place.\r\nThe garrison was summoned, but refused to surrender. The place\r\nwas immediately attacked and carried by escalade, 26th July. On\r\nthe following day, Wellesley marched to Gudduck, and occupied the\r\nfort which was evacuated before his arrival. Dhoondia, having thus\r\nlost all his forts in Savanoor and in the Dharwar country, moved\r\nnorthwards with the intention of crossing the river Malpurba. While\r\nencamped at Soondooti, he heard of Wellesley’s approach, and broke up\r\nhis army into three divisions. One division with the baggage encamped\r\nopposite Manoli, without crossing the river. Wellesley’s intention\r\nhad been to await the arrival of Lieut. Colonel Bowser’s column\r\nthat was operating to the eastward, but on hearing of the division\r\nof Dhoondia’s force, and of the baggage being on the Malpurba\r\nnear Manoli, he resolved to attack at once. Making a rapid march\r\nof twenty-six miles, he fell upon the enemy with the cavalry at 3\r\no’clock in the afternoon of the 30th, effecting a complete surprise.\r\nThe enemy were driven into the river, where great numbers of those\r\nwho escaped the swords of the horsemen were drowned: six guns, and\r\na great number of animals, especially horses, were captured, and the\r\nwhole force destroyed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Dhoondia with another Division had doubled back westward\r\nalong the south bank of the Malpurba. His adherents were beginning to\r\nleave him. Part of the Hyderabad detachment, augmented by a native\r\ncavalry regiment from Wellesley’s force, was now placed under Colonel\r\nStevenson, and directed to follow Dhoondia along the Malpurba, while\r\nWellesley moved parallel with Stevenson in the same direction, at\r\na distance of fifteen miles from the river. On the 5th August,\r\nWellesley reached Kittoor, where he halted for some days, for the\r\npurpose of making boats to cross the Malpurba. Here he learned that\r\nDhoondia had crossed the Malpurba near its sources, and had again\r\nturned eastward to Cowdelghee. Stevenson meanwhile had marched on\r\nHanoor. Dhoondia’s track was marked by the dead bodies of human\r\nbeings and animals.\r\n\r\nThe 16th, 17th and 18th were occupied by Wellesley in crossing the\r\nMalpurba, to Hoobli: Lieut. Colonel Capper with a Brigade of infantry\r\nand a regiment of native cavalry were left on the south side of the\r\nriver. At this time, Stevenson was marching along the south bank of\r\nthe Gutpurba river by Hanoor, Gokauk, Cowdelghee and Bhagelcottah;\r\nBowser was at Shapoor; while Wellesley moved eastwards along the\r\nnorth bank of the Malpurba. Dhoondia was steadily being pressed into\r\nthe fork of the Gutpurba and Malpurba rivers. South of the Malpurba,\r\nCapper was moving parallel with the other British forces, through\r\nSoondooti, Hooli, and Jellahal. The only chance of Dhoondia’s escape\r\nwas by a ford across the Malpurba, a little above its junction with\r\nthe Kistna, but the swollen state of the river seemed to render the\r\npassage improbable. Still, to provide for this contingency, the\r\nMahratta cavalry with Capper were directed to push on and hold the\r\nford; but the rough handling they had received on the 30th June, at\r\nKittoor, was still fresh in their minds, and they refused to leave\r\nthe British camp. As fortune would have it, the improbable happened.\r\nThe Malpurba suddenly fell, and Dhoondia crossed it on the 24th and\r\n25th. He was however obliged to abandon five guns, some ammunition,\r\narms &c. and ten thousand grain-carrying bullocks, all of which fell\r\ninto Wellesley’s hands. Capper, who had taken the forts of Hooli and\r\nSyringhi by escalade on the 22nd, was at Jellahal when he crossed.\r\n\r\nDhoondia was now in the fork of the Kistna and Toombadra rivers,\r\nand had placed himself, for the moment, so far on the flank of\r\nhis pursuers that, by rapid marching, he might have doubled back\r\nto Savanoor, where he would have done much mischief in destroying\r\nsupplies prepared for Wellesley; or he might have crossed the\r\nToombadra, with the aid of some local Chiefs who were believed to\r\nbe favourable to him, and entered Mysore. To prevent the execution\r\nof either design, Wellesley crossed the Malpurba at Jellahal, and\r\nmarched, first to Hunmunsagur, and then southward to Khanagheri,\r\nwhich he reached on the 7th September: Stevenson continued his march\r\nwestward, crossed the Malpurba, and reached Hoonagoonda, on the 5th;\r\nfrom thence he continued eastward towards Deodroog. Between the\r\ntwo forces, were the Nizam’s and Peishwa’s horse, collected in one\r\nbody. The chase was now drawing to a close. On the 8th, Wellesley\r\nleft Khanagheri with the cavalry, and pressed on to Buswapore, the\r\ninfantry and baggage following more slowly. On the 9th, he reached\r\nYepalpurri, the infantry being fifteen miles behind at Shinoor.\r\nOn the same day, Dhoondia broke up his camp at Mudgheri and moved\r\nnorthwards towards the Kistna, but, sighting Stevenson’s force, he\r\nturned south again, and encamped three miles from Conaghul, and\r\nabout nine miles from Wellesley at Yepalpurri.\r\n\r\nWellesley had news of Dhoondia’s position the same evening, but the\r\nnight was so bad, and the horses of the cavalry so fatigued, that\r\nhe did not move till next day. Marching early on the 10th, he came\r\non Dhoondia’s force, consisting of about 5000 horsemen, at Conaghul\r\nsix miles from Yepalpurri. Dhoondia had left his camp and baggage,\r\nand was on the march westward, with the view of passing between the\r\nNizam’s and Mahratta cavalry and Wellesley’s force, which he believed\r\nto be at Shinoor. He drew up at once in a very strong position, with\r\nhis rear and left flank covered by the village and rock of Conaghul,\r\n“and stood for some time with apparent firmness.” Wellesley formed\r\nthe 19th and 25th Light Dragoons and 1st and 2nd Native Cavalry into\r\none line, and charged at their head.\r\n\r\n“Such was the rapidity and determination of the charge made by those\r\nfour regiments, which I was obliged to form in one line in order at\r\nall to equalise in length that of the enemy, that the whole gave way,\r\nand were pursued by my cavalry for many miles.”[42] Dhoondia’s body\r\nwas recognised among the slain, and brought into camp on a galloper\r\ngun of the 19th. The same evening, Colonel Stevenson came up with the\r\nremains of the retreating enemy near Deodroog, and entirely dispersed\r\nthem, capturing their remaining guns, baggage and cattle.\r\n\r\nThe episode of Dhoondia Wao is an instance of the danger likely to\r\narise out of the overthrow of a military government, when a large\r\nnumber of disbanded men are suddenly thrown out of employ without\r\nmeans of subsistence. It was the overthrow of Tippoo’s kingdom\r\nand the dispersal of his large army that enabled Dhoondia to\r\ngather together so formidable a force. In like manner, it was the\r\ndisbanding of so many French officers and soldiers in 1814, that gave\r\nNapoleon’s return from Elba a chance of success, and, in more recent\r\ntimes, the trouble that arose after the conquest of Burmah in 1886\r\nwas partly due to the large number of armed men suddenly deprived of\r\nmeans of subsistence, and left without control.\r\n\r\nThe short three months’ campaign had been a most harassing one to the\r\ntroops, and especially to the cavalry, while it lasted. Writing to\r\nthe Commander in Chief, at the close of operations, Wellesley says\r\n“The 19th and 25th Light Dragoons were in fine order when they joined\r\nthe force, and I am happy to say they remain so in spite of the very\r\nharassing nature of the operations in which they have been engaged.”\r\n\r\nThe 19th had been commanded by Major Paterson during the campaign.\r\nAt its close the regiment returned to Seringapatam with Wellesley.\r\nEarly in 1801, they were moved to Cheyloor. The country was still in\r\na very disturbed state. Several of the Hindoo feudatory Chiefs, known\r\nas Polygars, claimed independence for themselves on the overthrow\r\nof Tippoo’s rule; and, from their jungle fastnesses, committed\r\ndepredations on the surrounding country. Chief among them were\r\nthe Pyche Rajah, Kistnapah Naik, and a zemindar chief who styled\r\nhimself the Rajah of Bullum. The Mysore forces were unable to deal\r\neffectually with them without the aid of British troops. Towards\r\nthe end of the year, arrangements were made to settle accounts with\r\nthe Rajah of Bullum, and, on the 8th January 1802, Wellesley left\r\nSeringapatam with 540 European infantry of the 77th and the Regiment\r\nde Meuron, four battalions of Sepoys, 500 pioneers, ten guns, and\r\nfour mortars. On the 8th, he was joined, at Chinroypatam, by the 19th\r\nLight Dragoons, under Major Paterson, and the 5th Native Cavalry,\r\nwith their galloper guns.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah of Bullum occupied a tract of dense forest, called\r\nArrekeery, near the Coorg border, about eighteen miles in\r\ncircumference, covering the approach to Mysore by the Bissolee Pass.\r\nIn this tract of forest were a number of fortified villages defended\r\nby dense bamboo hedges, and all approaches through the forest were\r\ndefended by bamboo barriers. For two years the Bullum Rajah had\r\nbeen able to defy the newly resuscitated power of the Mysore Rajah;\r\nplundering the adjoining British districts in Canara, and closing\r\nthe road between Mysore and the coast. After three days spent in\r\nreconnoitring the ground, Wellesley delivered his attack at 10 A.M.\r\non the 16th. The infantry, in three divisions, entered the forest\r\nsimultaneously at three different points. The 19th accompanied\r\nthe column headed by Wellesley, which was destined to attack the\r\nprincipal posts. The attack was completely successful, and, after\r\na brief conflict, all resistance ceased. The loss of the troops\r\nwas trifling. The 19th had two men wounded. The Rajah managed to\r\nescape, but was captured three weeks later by some Mysore horsemen.\r\nBefore returning to Seringapatam, Wellesley reviewed the 19th at\r\nHassan on the 13th February, when he issued the following brief\r\norder: “Colonel Wellesley will have great pleasure in reporting\r\nto the Commander-in-Chief the excellent state in which he found\r\nthe 19th Light Dragoons.” The Regiment then marched to Sara, where\r\narrangements were made to build barracks for them. Hardly were the\r\nbarracks completed, when so much sickness broke out in the regiment,\r\nthat they were moved back to their old quarters at Cheyloor at the\r\nbeginning of June. A fortnight later, as matters did not improve,\r\nthey were ordered to Arcot. They were soon to take the field again,\r\nto encounter the most formidable army then existing in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nINDIA IN 1803\r\n\r\n  State of affairs in India in 1803--The Mahratta Confederacy--The\r\n  Peishwa--Scindia--European Adventurers in India--Scindia’s\r\n  disciplined forces--Perron--Quarrels among the Mahratta\r\n  Chiefs--Peishwa takes refuge in Bombay--Places himself under\r\n  protection of the British--Scindia’s hostility aroused--Mahratta\r\n  combination against the British--Peishwa restored to\r\n  Poona--Preparations for hostilities--Summary of campaign that\r\n  followed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the state of affairs existing in India at the\r\nbeginning of 1803, a brief retrospect is necessary. The Mogul Empire\r\nhad ceased to exist except in name. The old Emperor Shah Alum, still\r\noccupied the palace at Delhi, but only as a blind pensioner of the\r\nMahrattas. Everywhere on the ruins of Mahommedan rule new Hindoo\r\nStates had come into vigorous existence, and were even beginning to\r\nquarrel over the spoils. In the North the Sikhs, and to the East\r\nthe Goorkhas, were fast forming powerful States. In the South, the\r\nshort-lived kingdom of Hyder Ali and Tippoo had been swept out of\r\nexistence, while the power of the Nizam was gradually growing weaker\r\nunder the encroachment of his Mahratta neighbours. In the great\r\ntract of country stretching from the Sutlej to the Kistna, and from\r\nthe Company’s territories in Bengal to the Bay of Cambay, a tract\r\nmeasuring approximately a thousand miles from North to South, and\r\nfrom East to West, the supremacy of the Mahratta Chiefs was complete.\r\nCalcutta, Benares, Bombay, Hyderabad, and Madras were all within easy\r\nstriking distance of their predatory hordes. Their principal Chiefs\r\nwere the Rajah of Satara, the Peishwa with his seat of government\r\nat Poona, the Scindia with his capital at Oojain, the Holkar whose\r\ncapital was at Indore, the Gaekwar at Baroda, the Bhonslay of Berar,\r\nwhose capital was Nagpore, and the Rajah of Kolapore. The nominal\r\nChiefship of the whole confederacy rested in the Rajah of Satara,\r\nthe descendant of Sivaji, the founder of the Mahratta power. But the\r\nSatara Rajahs had long sunk into the grade of petty princes devoid of\r\nmilitary or political influence. As the power of the Satara Rajahs\r\ndeclined, that of the Peishwa, the hereditary Prime Minister, rose.\r\nRuling at first in the name of the Satara Chief, the Peishwas had in\r\ntime grown into independent princes, wielding the whole power of the\r\nMahratta Confederacy. But the power of the Peishwas in its turned\r\nwaned, so that, in 1776, the Peishwa Rughonath Rao was forced to seek\r\nasylum with the English in Bombay. Since then a partial revival of\r\nthe Peishwa’s power had taken place under the protection of Scindia,\r\nwho had become the foremost Chief in the Confederacy; and partly\r\nowing to the abilities of the Peishwa’s Minister, Nana Farnawis.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1803, Scindia was the most powerful Chief in\r\nIndia. Drawing great revenues from a vast area, he held Delhi with\r\nits pensioner monarch in the North, received tribute from the Rajpoot\r\nStates in the centre, and had a predominant voice in the Councils\r\nof the Poona Court in the Deccan. The fiction of ruling in the name\r\nof the Satara Chief had long ceased to be maintained: government\r\nin the name of the Peishwa was fast becoming a fiction. A cardinal\r\npoint in the policy of Nana Farnawis was to promote friendship with\r\nthe English Government, in order to preserve some check on Scindia’s\r\npredominance. One of the most important sources of Scindia’s power\r\nwas the large force maintained by him, disciplined and commanded by\r\nEuropeans. At that date, India swarmed with adventurers of every\r\nnationality, two-thirds of whom were of French extraction. Their\r\npresence in India was an important factor in the politics of the\r\nday. Every Chief, however unimportant he might be, had Europeans to\r\nlead his troops. The first Chief in India to thoroughly recognize\r\nthe importance of European organization and discipline had been\r\nHyder Ali of Mysore. But his efforts had been directed rather to\r\nforming complete Corps of European Artillery, Cavalry, and Infantry,\r\nwhich never exceeded a few hundreds in number. He also had many\r\nEuropeans as leaders of his native troops, but little was done by\r\nhim to discipline native troops on the European model. It was Madho\r\nRao Scindia who first developed the system of disciplining his\r\nnative troops in European fashion under the celebrated De Boigne,\r\nwhich quickly rendered him the most powerful Chief in India. At the\r\ntime of which we are treating, his nephew and successor, Dowlut Rao\r\nScindia, had in his service a force estimated at 43,650 men, with\r\n464 guns, armed and disciplined in European fashion, and commanded\r\nby Europeans. This formidable body of men had lived in a state of\r\ncontinuous warfare ever since it was first raised in 1784. At the\r\nhead of Scindia’s disciplined forces was the Frenchman Perron, who,\r\nhad raised himself practically to an independent position. Acting as\r\nScindia’s lieutenant in the North, he ruled over a great tract of\r\ncountry, extending from the Jumna to the foot of the Himalayas, and\r\nfrom the Sutlej to the Chumbul, and, owing to difficulties in which\r\nScindia had become recently involved in the Deccan, he entertained\r\ndreams of independence. Perron was known to be in correspondence with\r\nthe French Directory at Paris, and the British government was again\r\nthreatened with the possibility of the establishment of French power\r\nin India on the ruins of the Native States in the North-West and the\r\nDeccan. Perron and the British Governor General each recognised in\r\nthe other his most formidable foe. Next in importance to Scindia,\r\namong the Mahratta Chiefs, was Holkar, whose military talents made\r\nhim Scindia’s most dangerous rival. His disciplined battalions,\r\ncommanded by Europeans, were second only in number and efficiency\r\nto Scindia’s. Fortunately the dissensions between these Chiefs had\r\nreached a height that made co-operation between them out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nFrom the conclusion of the Treaty of Salbye, 17th May 1782, to the\r\nend of 1802, no serious clash of interests had occurred between the\r\nBritish government and the Mahratta Chiefs. While Scindia and Holkar\r\nalternately extended their conquests at the expense of the Mahommedan\r\nand Rajpoot States, or strove together for supremacy at Poonah, the\r\nBritish Government preserved an attitude of neutrality, till events\r\noccurred that led Scindia into direct collision with the British\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIn 1798, dissensions broke out between Scindia and the widows of\r\nhis late uncle Madho Rao Scindia; in the following year, the ladies\r\nfled for protection to the Rajah of Kolapore, who was then at war\r\nwith the Peishwa. Raising a large force, the Kolapore Chief advanced\r\non Poona, and severe fighting ensued. The Peishwa and Scindia were\r\nhard pressed, the flame spread, and the whole Southern Mahratta\r\ncountry was thrown into disorder. Taking advantage of his rival’s\r\ndifficulties, Holkar took the field in Malwa, and ravaged Scindia’s\r\nterritories. Perron meanwhile was fully occupied in the North in\r\npreparations to resist a threatened Afghan invasion, and could\r\nrender no assistance to his master. At this juncture Nana Farnawis\r\ndied (13th March 1800), and a fresh dispute over his property arose\r\nbetween Scindia and the Peishwa. Fresh umbrage was taken by Scindia\r\nat the permission granted by the Peishwa for British troops to\r\nfollow Dhoondia Wao into Mahratta territory. In the midst of these\r\nembarrassments, Scindia’s presence in Malwa to oppose Holkar became\r\nimperatively necessary, and he left Poona. His movements were,\r\nhowever, so slow and ill-considered that Holkar was able to overwhelm\r\nin succession two of his disciplined brigades, under M‘Intyre and\r\nHessing (July 1801), and plundered Oojain. Roused by this disaster,\r\nScindia quickly dealt a counterstroke on the 14th Oct. 1801, when\r\nhe signally defeated Holkar in front of Indore, and plundered that\r\ncity. Failing however to follow up the blow, his possessions in\r\nKandeish were devastated by Holkar, who was soon in the field again,\r\nmoving towards Poona. Scindia’s General, Sadasheo Bhow, interposed\r\nbetween Holkar’s army and the capital; but Holkar was not to be\r\ndenied, and, on 25th Oct. 1802, the combined armies of Scindia and\r\nthe Peishwa were completely defeated at Poona, after a sanguinary\r\nengagement which was fought under the eyes of the British Resident.\r\nDismayed at this catastrophe, the Peishwa fled to the coast, where\r\nhe was received on board a British vessel, and conveyed to Bassein,\r\nnear Bombay. There, on the 31st December, was signed the Treaty of\r\nBassein, by which the Peishwa formally placed himself under the\r\nprotection and guidance of the British Govt., with whom he concluded\r\nan offensive and defensive alliance. It soon became evident that the\r\nPeishwa’s treaty had aroused Scindia’s hostility, and that he was\r\npreparing for war.\r\n\r\nTill recently, Scindia had viewed the Company’s power with\r\ncomparative indifference. Their undertakings had not always been\r\nsuccessful; their resources, so far as he was able to judge, were\r\ngreatly inferior to his own, and, with his disciplined battalions,\r\nhe believed himself able to give a good account of any army the\r\nBritish Government could bring into the field. His resentment was\r\nfirst awakened by the treaty concluded in September 1798 between the\r\nCompany and the Nizam, on whom the Mahratta Chiefs conceived that\r\nthey had claims. On the outbreak of the war between Tippoo and the\r\nEnglish, Scindia formed the project of attacking the Nizam, but the\r\nfall of Tippoo, before he could take the field, caused him to abandon\r\nthe plan, and Scindia became aware that the Company’s power was more\r\nformidable than he had suspected. It was, however, no policy of\r\nwanton aggression on our part that brought about the wars waged by\r\nthe Marquis of Wellesley. The real contest was between the British\r\nand French power in India. England and France were locked in a deadly\r\nstruggle, which in India, on the French side, was fought out by\r\nNative Chiefs directed by French officers in correspondence with the\r\nFrench Directory in Paris. Had it not been so, our policy would have\r\nbeen directed to smoothing over matters in India, while our whole\r\nweight was thrown into the scale elsewhere. But circumstances did\r\nnot allow of this, and it was in pursuance of the policy forced on\r\nus, that, first, Tippoo the centre of French influence in India was\r\nstruck down; next, the French party at Hyderabad were dispersed by\r\nour assuming protection of the Nizam; and finally Scindia, the Rajah\r\nof Berar and Holkar were humbled by the defeat of their disciplined\r\narmies by Lake and Wellesley.\r\n\r\nThe assumption of the protectorate of the Peishwa, was regarded\r\nby Scindia as a challenge for the mastery of India. A defensive\r\nalliance was offered to him by the British, which he rejected, and\r\nhis apprehensions were worked on by the Bhonslay Rajah of Berar,\r\nwho was the prime mover in the war that followed. The quarrel with\r\nHolkar was patched up, and an alliance was formed between Scindia,\r\nHolkar and the Bhonslay to be directed against the Peishwa, the\r\nNizam, and the East India Company. An able and comprehensive plan\r\nfor simultaneous action was devised by Perron, by which one hundred\r\nand fifteen thousand predatory horse and ninety-four battalions\r\nwould have at once carried fire and sword into the Company’s and\r\nthe Nizam’s territories, and would have prevented any co-operation\r\nbetween the three powers thus assailed. But the plan came to nothing.\r\nPerron’s intrigues had aroused the distrust of Scindia, while the\r\nlong existing animosity between Scindia and Holkar was too recent\r\nand too bitter to allow of prompt co-operation. The Mahratta Chiefs\r\ncalculated on the British forces not moving till after the rainy\r\nseason, and expected no active hostilities before October. Holkar’s\r\nforces were so tardily set in motion, that they were still on the\r\nNerbudda when the battle of Assaye was fought. On receipt of the news\r\nhe withdrew his troops to Indore, and avoided compromising himself\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\nScindia, having suspended all operations against Holkar, had marched\r\nsouthwards to Burhanpore, towards the end of February, where he was\r\njoined by the Nagpore Rajah. Their joint forces then advanced towards\r\nthe Nizam’s frontier where they encamped.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Scindia’s hostile intentions became known, a force of\r\nnearly 20,000 men was assembled at Hurryhur, on the north-west\r\nfrontier of Mysore, under Major General the Hon. A. Wellesley. The\r\nrestoration of the Peishwa to his capital was the first thing to be\r\ndone. On the 9th March, Wellesley marched for Poona with 10,617 men,\r\namong whom were the 19th Light Dragoons, drawing 412 sabres. The\r\nremainder of the force was commanded by Colonel Stevenson, acting in\r\nconcert with Wellesley. On the 20th April, Wellesley reached Poona,\r\nthe last sixty miles being covered in 32 hours by the cavalry, who\r\nhad been pushed on ahead to save the city from being plundered.[43]\r\nHolkar’s forces withdrew on his approach, and, on the 13th May, the\r\nPeishwa arrived from Bassein escorted by British troops. Wellesley\r\nthen advanced to Walkee, six miles from Ahmednuggur, while\r\nnegotiations with the confederated Mahratta Chiefs continued. By the\r\nend of July all hope of preserving peace had disappeared. The British\r\nResident with Scindia was therefore directed to withdraw, which he\r\ndid on the 3rd August.\r\n\r\nThe campaign that ensued was remarkable, not only for its complete\r\nsuccess, but for the extended nature of the operations carried on\r\nsimultaneously by a number of bodies of troops, acting to a great\r\nextent in complete independence of each other, after the signal for\r\nhostilities had been given. No better lesson in the art of war could\r\nbe studied than in the dispositions made by the Marquis of Wellesley\r\nto bring matters to a successful issue, when the maintenance of\r\npeace was no longer possible. A brief resumé of them here will not\r\nbe out of place. As the negotiations with Scindia made the warlike\r\nintentions of that Chief more and more evident, troops were assembled\r\nat various points, so that, on the outbreak of hostilities, the\r\ndistribution of forces on both sides was as follows.\r\n\r\nThe combined Mahratta Chiefs, without Holkar, could dispose of 87\r\nbattalions of Infantry, 500 guns, and over 80,000 Cavalry. In the\r\nnorth, Perron had his Head Quarters at Alyghur, a fortress on which\r\nmuch dependence was placed. He had over 16,000 regular Infantry,\r\nabout 5000 regular Cavalry, and a great number of irregular troops.\r\nEn route to join him from the Deccan were 25,000 men, under a French\r\nofficer, Dudrenec, of whom nearly 8000 were regular Infantry. With\r\nScindia, in the Deccan, were over 16,000 Infantry and upwards of\r\n50,000 Mahratta Cavalry. In Bundelcund, under Shumshere Bahadoor,\r\nwere about 3000 regular Infantry, 20 guns, and 10,000 Cavalry.\r\nAll fortresses and fortified towns were strongly held, and there\r\nwere many detached corps of considerable strength in Cuttack and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nOn the British side, a force under the Commander-in-Chief, General\r\nLake, consisting of 10,500 men, was assembled at Cawnpore, destined\r\nto act against Perron. At Allahabad, a force of 3500 men, under Lt.\r\nColonel Powell, was assembled to operate in Bundelcund. At Chunar\r\nand Mirzapore, 2000 men were stationed under Major General Deare,\r\nto cover Benares and act on the defensive. From the Saone, near\r\nSasseram, to Pachet on the Damodar river, a similar force was so\r\ndisposed, under Lt. Colonel Broughton, as to cover the Company’s\r\nterritories in that region. This force was afterwards reinforced, and\r\ntook the offensive in the eastern provinces of Berar. Farther to the\r\nsouth east, at Midnapore, a force of 1300 men, under Colonel Fenwick,\r\nwas posted to cover the frontier and threaten Cuttack. At Ganjam, a\r\nforce of 3540 men was ready, under Lt. Colonel Campbell, to operate\r\nin Cuttack, supported by 500 men at Balasore, under Captain Morgan,\r\nand 854 men under Lt. Colonel Ferguson, at Jalasore. The Cuttack\r\noperations were however carried out by Lieut. Colonel Harcourt, in\r\nconsequence of the serious illness of Lt. Colonel Campbell at the\r\nvery commencement of field operations.\r\n\r\nIn the Deccan, to operate against Scindia, 8900 men, under Major\r\nGeneral the Honourable Arthur Wellesley, were encamped at Walkee near\r\nAhmednuggur. Farther to the eastward, and north of the Godavery, was\r\nColonel Stevenson with the Hyderabad subsidiary force, consisting\r\nof 7900 men and the Nizam’s own troops, acting as a separate corps\r\nin co-operation with Wellesley. In Guzerat, 7350 men under Colonel\r\nMurray, acting under the orders of Wellesley, furnished a corps of\r\n2187 men north of the Nerbudda, covering Baroda, and a second corps\r\nof 2094 men, south of the Tapti between Songhur and Surat: the\r\nremainder being employed to garrison Surat, Cambay, and Baroda, thus\r\neffectually cutting off Scindia’s access to the coast. In addition\r\nto these, garrisons of 1600 men and 2000 men were posted at Poona\r\nand Hyderabad respectively, to ensure tranquillity and protect those\r\ncapitals, while a reserve of 4032 men, under Major General Campbell,\r\nwas stationed at Moodgul, south of the Kistna.\r\n\r\nThat the strain on the Company’s resources was very great is evident\r\nfrom the fact that the Governor General sent his Body Guard into the\r\nfield, though he himself remained in Calcutta. The truest policy\r\ndemanded that the war should be actively prosecuted and brought\r\nto a decisive termination as soon as possible, before further\r\ncomplications should arise; not the least of which was the expected\r\narrival of a French squadron from Europe. How clearly this policy was\r\nrecognised and adopted, and how splendidly it was carried out may be\r\nseen from the mere record of achievements. The rapidity with which\r\nblow after blow was struck, will be best gathered from the following\r\ntable:--\r\n\r\n  _7th August_             General Lake commenced his advance towards\r\n                           Delhi.\r\n\r\n  _8th_   ”                The fortified town of Ahmednuggur taken\r\n                           by assault, by Major General Wellesley.\r\n\r\n  _10th_  ”                Fort of Ahmednuggur capitulated: taken\r\n                           possession of on 12th.\r\n\r\n  _26th_  ”                General Lake encamped on the frontier;\r\n                           received authority to commence hostilities.\r\n\r\n  _29th_  ”                Perron’s camp outside Alyghur captured by\r\n                           General Lake: Perron flies to Agra.\r\n\r\n     ”    ”                Broach, in Guzerat, taken by assault, by\r\n                           Lt.

The fort was an\r\nexceedingly strong one, and the pettah or fortified town was also\r\nstrongly held. An immediate assault on the pettah was ordered, which\r\nwas completely successful. The town was taken, at a cost of 27 killed\r\nand 92 wounded: the 19th Light Dragoons had one man wounded. This\r\nwas a brilliant opening to the campaign, which impressed friends and\r\nenemies alike. A Mahratta Chief, commanding a body of the Peishwa’s\r\nhorse in Wellesley’s camp, wrote to his friends in Poona: “These\r\nEnglish are a strange people, and their General a wonderful man: they\r\ncame here in the morning, looked at the pettah wall, walked over it,\r\nkilled all the garrison and returned to breakfast!” In attacking\r\nfortified places that did not require regular siege operations,\r\nWellesley successfully followed the plan, both in 1800 and on this\r\noccasion, of attacking by escalade directly he appeared before the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak on the 10th, a battery was opened against the fort, which\r\nsurrendered on the 12th.\r\n\r\nAfter arranging for the settlement of the Ahmednuggur district,\r\nWellesley crossed the Godavery at Toka, and advanced to Aurungabad,\r\nwhich he reached on the 29th August. The crossing of the Godavery\r\ntook seven days to complete. Scindia’s force meanwhile had entered\r\nthe Nizam’s territory by the Ajunta Pass, and had taken Jaulna. The\r\nMahratta army then moved southwards, as if intending to cross the\r\nGodavery and attack Hyderabad, but were baffled by Wellesley moving\r\nsouthward along the left bank of the Godavery. They therefore turned\r\nnorthward again, from Partoor, towards the Ajunta Pass, and encamped\r\nin the neighbourhood of Bokerdun and Assaye. In the interval,\r\nStevenson, who had been operating to the north-eastward, returned and\r\nretook Jaulna on the 2nd September. On the 6th, and again on the 9th,\r\nhe surprised the camps of two parties of Mahratta horse, after which\r\nhe halted at Budnapore, near Jalgaum. Wellesley was delayed on the\r\nGodavery till the 18th, pending the arrival of a large convoy.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st, he reached Jalgaum, where he concerted a plan of\r\noperation with Stevenson. According to the best information, the\r\nenemy was believed to be at Bokerdun and Jaffirabad, about thirty\r\nmiles distant, but the enormous numbers of the enemy’s cavalry made\r\nit impossible to procure trustworthy information by reconnoissance.\r\nIt was agreed that the two forces should advance next day by\r\nseparate roads, and fall on the enemy on the 24th. At the end of\r\nthe first day’s march, on the 22nd, news was brought to Wellesley,\r\nat Paugri, that the enemy was moving westward, and was making for\r\nthe Ajunta Pass. The news was false. Stevenson’s line of march lay\r\nabout fifteen miles westward of Wellesley’s. On the 23rd, Wellesley\r\nmade a fourteen-mile march to Naulniah. On arriving there, he found\r\nthat, instead of being ten or twelve miles from the enemy, as he had\r\nanticipated, he was only half that distance from them. He was also\r\ntold that their cavalry had moved off, and the infantry were about to\r\nfollow. It was necessary to ascertain the truth at once. The baggage\r\nwas accordingly left at Naulniah, under charge of a battalion of\r\nNative Infantry and the rearguard picquets,[44] and the rest of the\r\nforce moved forwards. The General, at the same time, pushed on ahead\r\nwith the Cavalry. Without counting the force detached to guard the\r\nbaggage in Naulniah, Wellesley’s force consisted of nearly 6000 men\r\n(of whom about 1600 were Europeans), and 14 guns, of which eight were\r\nthe 6 Pr. galloper guns of the Cavalry. There were also contingents\r\nof the Mysore and Peishwa’s horsemen. After going about three miles,\r\nhe suddenly, about one o’clock, came in sight of the enemy’s camp\r\nbeyond the Kaitna, near the village of Assaye, in a peninsula formed\r\nby the junction of the Kaitna and Juah rivers. The Kaitna was only\r\npassable at certain points; the Juah had less water in it, but had\r\nvery steep banks. Along both rivers the ground was much broken by\r\nravines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF ASSAYE\r\n\r\n23rd. September 1803.\r\n\r\n  _Walker & Boutall sc._]\r\n\r\nWellesley’s position was a difficult one. He had unexpectedly come\r\ninto close contact with a vastly superior force ready to receive\r\nhim, instead of being in the act of moving off, as he had been led\r\nto expect. Stevenson’s force, in co-operation with which he had\r\nintended to fight the action, was ten or twelve miles away. Should\r\nhe retreat to Naulniah and wait for Stevenson, he would be followed\r\nand forced to fight under disadvantageous circumstances, and, owing\r\nto the enemy’s great superiority in cavalry, would probably lose a\r\nportion of his baggage. He resolved to cross the river and attack\r\nat once. He saw that if he could carry his force across the Kaitna\r\nanywhere near its junction with the Juah, the great superiority in\r\nnumbers of the Mahrattas would be to a certain extent neutralized by\r\nthe narrower front on which they would be obliged to engage. At the\r\nsame time, should his attack fail, Wellesley was liable to be forced\r\nback into the acute angle formed by the two rivers, and be destroyed,\r\nlike Charles XII. at Pultava. It was a choice of risks, and Wellesley\r\nchose the smaller one. The direct ford was commanded by the powerful\r\nMahratta artillery, which made crossing at that point extremely\r\nhazardous. Examining the ground with his glasses, Wellesley noticed\r\nthe two villages of Peepulgaon and Waroor close together on opposite\r\nsides of the river, and, in spite of the denial of his guides,\r\njumped to the conclusion that there must be a ford there. A search\r\nshowed that he was right, and word was sent back for the infantry to\r\ndirect their march on Peepulgaon. Meanwhile the Cavalry (A. in plan)\r\nremained facing a large body of the enemy’s Cavalry (B. in plan),\r\nthat had crossed the river. By this time, the Mahratta camp had been\r\nstruck, and their army appeared drawn up in a long line (C. in plan),\r\ncovered by the Kaitna, with a great mass of cavalry on the right, and\r\nthe guns on the left.\r\n\r\nAs the British force moved across the enemy’s front, part of it came\r\nwithin range of the Mahratta Artillery, but beyond a Staff Officer\r\nbeing slightly wounded, and the General’s orderly dragoon having\r\nhis head carried off by a round shot, no loss was incurred. The\r\ncrossing of the Kaitna was effected without opposition, and the\r\nBritish force was drawn up across the fork between the two rivers\r\nin three lines (F. in plan). The first two lines, with an interval\r\nof about 300 paces between them, were composed of infantry, H.M.’s\r\n78th Regiment being on the left of the first line, and H.M.’s 74th\r\non the right of the 2nd line. The cavalry formed the third line.\r\nThe Peishwa’s and Mysore cavalry remained on the south side of the\r\nKaitna (D. in plan), to keep in check a large body of the enemy’s\r\ncavalry. There was a good deal of delay in crossing the Kaitna, which\r\nwas taken advantage of by the enemy to change front to the left of\r\ntheir first line, and they now occupied a long line (E. in plan),\r\nwith its left resting on the village of Assaye, and defended along\r\nthe whole front by upwards of one hundred guns. The village of Assaye\r\nwas occupied with infantry, and had a number of guns disposed in\r\nfront of it. The Mahratta line of battle, exclusive of a large body\r\nof troops detailed to guard stores and baggage, consisted of thirteen\r\nbattalions of disciplined infantry, one hundred and fifteen guns, and\r\nover thirty-five thousand horsemen. There were also a large number of\r\nundisciplined infantry.\r\n\r\nWhile the British lines were forming, the movement was covered by\r\nartillery fire. This was quickly responded to by the Mahratta guns,\r\nwhich caused such severe losses among the British gun bullocks, that\r\nthe guns had to be left behind when the advance was made.\r\n\r\nWellesley had not given the enemy credit for being able to change\r\ntheir front with so large a force, without falling into disarray. On\r\nperceiving the alteration in the enemy’s position, he saw that it was\r\nnecessary to extend his front. He accordingly ordered the picquets,\r\nwhich formed the right of the first line, to move obliquely to the\r\nright, so as to allow the native infantry battalions in the second\r\nline to come up on the right of the first line, H.M.’s 74th being\r\ndirected to take the right of the whole. Wellesley’s intention was to\r\nforce back the enemy from their guns, then, operating by his left, to\r\nthrow them back on the Juah, and complete their destruction with his\r\ncavalry. Wellesley himself led the left of the line, while Lieutenant\r\nColonel Maxwell and the cavalry were ordered to support the right,\r\nwhich was still greatly outflanked. Particular orders were given to\r\nthe officer in command of the picquets, which formed the battalion\r\nof direction, to keep out of gunshot of Assaye. But the losses\r\ncaused by the Mahratta artillery were so severe, that the advance\r\nbecame necessary before the formation was complete. Every shot told,\r\nknocking over men, horses, and bullocks, and putting several of\r\nthe British guns out of action. Wellesley on the left, impatient\r\nto advance, sent repeated messages to the officer commanding the\r\npicquets. He was told that the guns were disabled, to which he\r\nreplied “Well, tell him to get on without them.”\r\n\r\nAs the line advanced, the Mahratta infantry gave ground, abandoning\r\ntheir guns. By mistake, the officer commanding the picquets continued\r\nhis oblique movement too far, and led direct on Assaye, masking the\r\n74th; a mistake that had an important influence on the course of\r\nthe battle. This caused a great gap in the British line, separated\r\nthe picquets and H.M. 74th from the rest of the line, and brought\r\nthem under a tremendous fire of artillery and small arms. They\r\nwere further impeded in their advance and thrown into disarray, by\r\nhaving to pass some cactus hedges. The Mahratta infantry, as they\r\nfell back from their guns, separated into two distinct bodies. The\r\ngreater number threw back their right, forming a second line (H. in\r\nplan), with the Juah river at its back, and its left still resting\r\non Assaye; while one whole Brigade, under a German named Pohlman,\r\ncontinued to retreat directly to its rear (M. in plan). At the same\r\ntime, great numbers of the enemy threw themselves down, pretending to\r\nbe dead, and allowed the British line to pass over them. The British\r\nline swung round to its right (I. in plan), to attack the enemy’s\r\nsecond line, and, here the first critical period of the battle\r\noccurred. The picquets and H.M. 74th Foot were no longer able to\r\nadvance under the terrible fire to which they were exposed. Numbers\r\nfell at every step; all formation was lost, and a body of Mahratta\r\nhorse, wheeling round the village of Assaye, charged the 74th in\r\nflank, sabreing numbers of them. They also recaptured some of their\r\nown guns, and gained possession of some of the British guns that had\r\nnot been able to keep up with the advance, killing the gunners and\r\nturning the guns against the British rear. It was a critical moment,\r\nand, with a soldier’s instinct, Maxwell saw that the time for action\r\nhad come. Advancing with his brigade, Maxwell charged the enemy’s\r\nleft, driving them into the Juah with great slaughter: then, as the\r\nrest of the line advanced and drove the enemy into the nullah, the\r\nCavalry crossed the Juah, and charged the broken masses of the enemy\r\n(J. in plan), making a horrid slaughter of them, and driving them off\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\n  “The 19th Light Dragoons, who only drew 360 swords, received the\r\n  intimation with one loud huzza! Accompanied by the 4th native\r\n  cavalry who emulated their conduct throughout this arduous day,\r\n  the 19th passed through the broken but invincible 74th, whose\r\n  very wounded joined in cheering them as they went on, cut in and\r\n  routed the horse, and dashed on at the infantry and guns. Never\r\n  did cavalry perform better service or contribute more to the\r\n  success of a battle.”[45]\r\n\r\nBut the battle was not yet over. A great body of the enemy still\r\nremained, holding Assaye and the ground between the village and the\r\nJuah, while the guns they had got possession of in different parts\r\nof the field played on the rear of the exhausted British troops.\r\nPohlman’s brigade also was unbroken, and threatened an attack. Two\r\nsepoy battalions sent successively against Assaye were repulsed.\r\nMaxwell’s cavalry were still across the Juah in pursuit of the broken\r\nMahratta battalions, and, had the Mahratta horsemen behaved at this\r\njuncture with the same spirit that had led them to charge the 74th,\r\nthe day might have been theirs. At this crisis, Maxwell with the\r\ncavalry returned from across the Juah, and formed up on the left of\r\nthe British line. Directing Maxwell with the 19th Light Dragoons and\r\ntwo of his native regiments to face Pohlman’s brigade, Wellesley\r\ntook H.M.’s 78th and a regiment of Native Cavalry, and moved against\r\nAssaye. The enemy did not await the attack, but retreated across\r\nthe Juah in tolerable order. In this movement, the General had his\r\nhorse killed by a cannon shot. Then, moving along the whole line\r\nfirst occupied by the enemy (E. in plan), he recaptured all the\r\nguns, not without some severe fighting. Meanwhile, Maxwell led the\r\n19th Light Dragoons and the two native regiments (L. in plan),\r\nto charge Pohlman’s brigade. Both men and horses were exhausted\r\nwith the efforts they had made, and the attack, instead of being\r\ndelivered perpendicular to the enemy’s front, was made obliquely\r\nagainst Pohlman’s left. The well disciplined Mahrattas reserved their\r\nfire till they could deliver it with good effect, and Maxwell fell\r\ndead pierced by a grape shot. The fall of their leader checked the\r\nsquadrons almost at the moment of contact, and the British horsemen\r\nswept to the left, receiving the fire of the Mahratta infantry as\r\nthey passed, at so close a distance, that several of the squadron\r\nofficers had their horses wounded with bayonets. No further effort\r\nwas made, the squadrons “halted, and then walked, and then trotted\r\nback.”[46] The British troops were so few in numbers, so weakened and\r\nfatigued by their exertions, as to be incapable of farther efforts,\r\nand Pohlman marched off the field without farther molestation.\r\nThus ended the conflict. The Mysore and friendly Mahratta horse,\r\nwho throughout the contest had only one casualty, would not pursue\r\nwithout the British cavalry, and the British cavalry were too\r\nexhausted to give them a lead. Out of the small British force, there\r\nwere, among the Europeans, 198 killed, 442 wounded, and 4 missing;\r\namong the Natives, 230 killed, 696 wounded, and 14 missing. The\r\n19th Light Dragoons, who had the greatest share of casualties among\r\nthe cavalry, lost two officers killed, Lieutenant Colonel Maxwell\r\nand Captain Boyle, four officers wounded, Captains Cathcart and\r\nSale, and Lieutenants Wilson and Young; fifteen Rank and File and\r\neighty-seven horses killed, thirty-six Rank and File and thirty-six\r\nhorses wounded, two horses missing. Of the enemy, it was computed\r\nthat twelve hundred lay dead on the field, and four thousand eight\r\nhundred were wounded. One hundred and two guns,[47] seven stands of\r\ncolours, and a vast quantity of ammunition and stores remained in the\r\nhands of the victors.\r\n\r\nIt was eight o’clock in the evening before the field was entirely\r\nclear of the enemy. The cavalry were then sent back to Naulniah\r\nto bring on the camp equipage, &c., which they did the following\r\nmorning. The rest of the force bivouacked as best they could on the\r\nbloody field. Wellesley, who had had one horse killed, and another\r\nwounded with a spear, passed the night on the ground, close to an\r\nofficer whose leg was shot off, and within five yards of a dead\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\n  “The General was so overcome by his great and gallant exertions\r\n  throughout the day, so overpowered both in mind and body, that\r\n  during the greater part or whole of the following night he sat on\r\n  the ground with his head bent down between his knees, and said\r\n  not a word to any one!”[48]\r\n\r\nLong after his victorious career was ended, he spoke of Assaye as\r\nthe bloodiest battle for the number engaged that he ever saw. Of\r\nthe ten officers forming the General’s staff eight were wounded\r\nor had their horses shot. The 74th and the picquet battalion were\r\nalmost annihilated; one picquet half company alone had 21 killed, 22\r\nwounded, and three missing. The 74th lost 401 of all ranks, killed\r\nand wounded. Two of the native cavalry regiments, being newly raised,\r\nwere not as forward as they should have been, so that the brunt of\r\nthe cavalry work was borne by the 19th Light Dragoons and the 4th\r\nNative Cavalry. Much of the heavy loss suffered by the British troops\r\nwas due to the misunderstanding of Wellesley’s orders by the officer\r\ncommanding the picquets, though, as Wellesley generously said, in a\r\nletter written a month later, “I must acknowledge that it was not\r\npossible for a man to lead a body into a hotter fire than he did the\r\npicquets on that day against Assaye.” The early use of the cavalry,\r\nhowever, prevented the total destruction of the enemy that he had\r\nintended. The exhaustion caused by their efforts too early in the\r\nbattle, prevented them from entirely breaking up and routing the\r\ndisciplined Mahratta infantry.\r\n\r\nA singular circumstance is said to have occurred after the battle.\r\nEach of the Commanders of the three armies, put to death his head spy.\r\n\r\n  “Colonel Stevenson, because he suspected or believed his own\r\n  to have led him intentionally astray from the road: General\r\n  Wellesley, by reason of his own having given him false\r\n  intelligence respecting the march of the Mahratta Army to pass\r\n  the Ajunta Ghaut; and Scindia, from his man not having made\r\n  him acquainted with the separation of the two divisions of the\r\n  British Army.”[49]\r\n\r\nAmple testimony has been borne to the conspicuous gallantry of the\r\n19th in this hard fought field.\r\n\r\n  “Nothing could exceed the zeal of some of the cavalry,\r\n  particularly the 19th dragoons; every officer and man fought\r\n  as if on his arm depended the victory. As instances may be\r\n  mentioned, Lieutenant Nathan Wilson, who with his arm shattered\r\n  by a grape shot, and dangling by his side, charged on at the\r\n  head of his troop. Lieutenant Alex. Grant of the Madras Native\r\n  Infantry, Major of brigade to Colonel Maxwell, observing a gun\r\n  pointed ready to discharge on the flank of the 19th dragoons,\r\n  the match suspended on the touch-hole, with a noble impulse, in\r\n  hopes of preventing it, darted forward almost on its muzzle, and\r\n  with such force, that his horse stuck between the cannon and its\r\n  wheel: in this situation the gun went off, as he was in the act\r\n  of endeavouring to prevent it, by cutting down the artillery man.\r\n  Captain George Sale was attacking a man who defended himself\r\n  with a pike or short spear, a weapon with which all Scindia’s\r\n  Artillery men were armed; the man’s comrade standing on a gun,\r\n  made a thrust from above at Captain Sale, but it was turned off\r\n  by the breastbone and glanced off diagonally across his chest;\r\n  his covering serjeant named Strange, laid the man dead who\r\n  wounded his officer, but in the act was himself speared through\r\n  the lungs, by another man from below the gun. Captain Sale went\r\n  on but begged the serjeant to fall in the rear; this however he\r\n  gallantly refused, and rode out the day. Captain Sale and others\r\n  afterwards saw him when in hospital, blow out a candle from his\r\n  lungs--the reader will be pleased to learn that the gallant\r\n  serjeant recovered.”[50]\r\n\r\nAmong other incidents may be mentioned the case of Cornet Serle of\r\nthe 19th who was under arrest at the time of the action, for some\r\ndisagreement with his commanding officer. At the commencement of the\r\nbattle he broke his arrest, and joined his corps, and, by his gallant\r\nbehaviour throughout the day, regained permission to wear his sword\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Colonel Maxwell’s splendid service was fittingly\r\nrecognized by the East India Company, who granted a pension of £300\r\nto his widow, “although we find that there is no example of the\r\nCompany’s making any allowance to the widow of a King’s Officer.”[51]\r\n\r\n  “As long as the word Assaye exists, and has a meaning will the\r\n  valiant deeds and reckless bravery of the old 19th Light Dragoons\r\n  the 74th and 78th Highlanders be remembered.”[52]\r\n\r\nIn his dispatch to the Governor General, dated the day after the\r\nbattle, Wellesley wrote: “I have also to draw your Excellency’s\r\nnotice to the conduct of the Cavalry commanded by Lieutenant Colonel\r\nMaxwell, particularly that of the 19th Dragoons”: and, in a General\r\nOrder published in Calcutta on the 30th October, it was said, “The\r\nGovernor General in Council has remarked with great satisfaction\r\nthe gallant and skilful conduct of the Cavalry, commanded by Lt.\r\nColonel Maxwell and particularly of His Majesty’s nineteenth regiment\r\nof Light Dragoons, a corps distinguished in India by a long and\r\nuninterrupted course of arduous service and of progressive honour.”\r\nHonorary colours in commemoration of the battle were granted to\r\nthe 19th Light Dragoons, the 74th and 78th “to be used by those\r\ncorps while they shall continue in India, or until His Majesty’s\r\nmost gracious pleasure be signified through his Excellency the\r\nCommander-in-Chief.”\r\n\r\nThe damage inflicted on the Mahratta host was far in excess of that\r\nindicated by their loss in men and material. Many of the disciplined\r\nbattalions had been destroyed, and hearty co-operation between the\r\nleaders was at an end. They fled northwards through the Ajunta Pass,\r\nabandoning some guns which were afterwards picked up by Stevenson,\r\nand then separated. Scindia, who believed that he had not been\r\nloyally supported by the Berar Rajah, retreated to Thalnair in\r\nKhandesh; the Berar Rajah retired to his fortress at Gawilghur, while\r\nfive battalions belonging to the Begum Somroo, four of which had\r\nbeen employed to guard the Mahratta camp, and therefore took no part\r\nin the action, retreated to Burhanpore, whence they made their way\r\nback to Sirdhana in the North West, and took no further part in the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nThe sound of Wellesley’s guns at Assaye was heard by Stevenson, who\r\nat once broke up camp and attempted to join him; but being without\r\ninformation, and misled by his guides, he marched first on Bokerdun,\r\nwhich he did not reach till next day, being entangled in a nullah\r\nduring the night. His force was greatly harassed by night marching\r\nand want of rest, so that he did not join Wellesley till the evening\r\nof the 24th. All the 25th he remained at Assaye, in order that his\r\nsurgeons might assist the wounded, and, on the 26th, marched in\r\npursuit of the enemy. Wellesley remained encamped near the field of\r\nbattle till the 8th October, to make arrangements for the care of\r\nhis numerous wounded, and for the captured guns and stores. Nor was\r\nthere urgent necessity for an immediate move, till something was\r\nknown of the movements of the enemy. The General’s first movements\r\nafter the battle were in the direction of Aurungabad, as Scindia\r\nshowed an intention of marching on Poona. Then, learning that\r\nScindia had turned back towards Burhanpore, on which place Stevenson\r\nwas advancing, Wellesley turned northwards to Ajunta. Stevenson\r\nmeanwhile had occupied Burhanpore on the 15th, and attacked the\r\nfortress of Asseerghur, which surrendered on the 21st. Wellesley,\r\nhearing that Scindia and the Berar Rajah had joined forces again, and\r\nwere threatening Stevenson, descended the Ajunta Pass on the 18th,\r\nand moved northwards; but, on receiving news that Asseerghur had\r\nfallen, and that the confederates had again separated, he retraced\r\nhis steps, ascended the Pass on the 25th, and marched to Aurungabad\r\nto protect some convoys which were threatened by the Berar Rajah.\r\nFrom Aurungabad he made several attempts to surprise the Bhonslay’s\r\ncamp without success, although he forced him to move his camp five\r\ntimes between the 29th and the 31st.\r\n\r\nWellesley continued moving slowly eastwards, to cover the Nizam’s\r\nterritory, till the 11th November, when he struck northwards from\r\nPatree to Rajoora, which he reached on the 23rd. For some days,\r\nScindia, under the influence of his defeat at Assaye in conjunction\r\nwith bad news from his forces in the North West, had made overtures\r\nfor a cessation of hostilities, and, on the 23rd, an armistice was\r\nagreed on; the principal condition of which was that Scindia should\r\nseparate himself from the Berar Rajah, and take up a position fifty\r\nmiles east of Ellichpore.\r\n\r\nThe agreement was not however faithfully observed by Scindia, some\r\nof whose troops took part in the subsequent battle. The Berar Rajah,\r\nmeanwhile, had entered his own territories, and was encamped at\r\nArgaum. On the 27th, Wellesley reached Akola, and, about 2 o’clock\r\nin the afternoon on the 29th, he joined Stevenson at Parterly, for\r\nthe purpose of undertaking the siege of Gawilghur with their united\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nThe Berar Rajah, who was encamped at Argaum about six miles from\r\nParterly, had meanwhile opened negotiations with Stevenson for a\r\nsuspension of hostilities, so preparations were made for encamping at\r\nParterly. On putting out the picquets to take up the ground, they\r\nwere molested by parties of the enemy, and, a reconnoissance showed\r\nthe Mahratta army drawn up in battle array, on an extensive plain\r\nin front of the village of Argaum. The troops were at once ordered\r\nto fall in, and the two divisions moved to the front in parallel\r\ncolumns. At about 1000 yards in front of the enemy was the village\r\nof Sirsoni. It was Wellesley’s intention to pass by the left of the\r\nvillage, and then, wheeling to the right, to form line in front of\r\nit, parallel with the Mahratta line of battle. The column was led\r\nby the native infantry picquets, accompanied by some field pieces\r\ndrawn by bullocks, followed by two native infantry battalions, all\r\nof whom had taken part in the battle of Assaye. On the head of the\r\ncolumn clearing the village, the Mahratta guns opened fire with\r\ngreat effect. The bullock drivers lost their presence of mind and\r\nthe management of their cattle, which turned round and threw into\r\nconfusion the ranks behind them. The troops coming up in rear, not\r\nknowing the cause of the confusion, and suffering from the cannonade,\r\nwere seized with panic, and fell back in disorder, to seek shelter\r\nbehind the village. Wellesley, who was close by, giving orders to the\r\nbrigadiers, seeing what had happened,\r\n\r\n  “stepped out in front hoping by his presence to restore the\r\n  confidence of the troops; but seeing that this did not produce\r\n  the desired effect, he mounted his horse, and rode up to the\r\n  retreating battalions; when, instead of losing his temper,\r\n  upbraiding them and endeavouring to force them back to the spot\r\n  from which they had fled, as most people would have done, he\r\n  quietly ordered the officers to lead their men under cover of the\r\n  village, and then to rally and get them into order as quickly as\r\n  possible. This being done, he put the column again in motion,\r\n  and leading these very same runaways round the other side of the\r\n  village, formed them up on the very spot he originally intended\r\n  them to occupy, the remainder of the column following and\r\n  prolonging the line to the right.”[53]\r\n\r\nThe lesson is one to be borne in mind by those to whose lot it may\r\nfall to rally troops thrown into disorder under fire.\r\n\r\nIn order to cover the formation, some guns were brought into action\r\non each side of the village, and, as each battalion came into\r\nposition, it was made to lie down, which further helped to steady the\r\ntroops. The infantry were formed into a single line, with Stevenson’s\r\ndivision on the left, while the six cavalry regiments of the two\r\ndivisions, under command of Lieutenant Colonel the Honble. Arthur St\r\nLeger, were formed in two lines in rear of the right. The British\r\nleft was covered by the native auxiliary horse. The Mahratta line was\r\nabout five miles in length, the infantry and guns in the centre, with\r\ncavalry on both flanks.\r\n\r\nIt was half past four in the afternoon before the British line\r\nadvanced. On the signal being given, the British cavalry moved\r\nrapidly forward, and brought their galloper guns into action against\r\na great body of the enemy’s cavalry and rocket men. Meanwhile, the\r\ninfantry advanced steadily against the Mahratta centre. When almost\r\nwithin musket shot, a body of the enemy’s infantry, nearly a thousand\r\nstrong, composed of Arabs or Pathans, dashed forward against the\r\n74th and 78th, and perished almost to a man under the Highland\r\nmusket and bayonet. Almost at the same moment, a body of Scindia’s\r\ncavalry charged the British left, and were repulsed with loss, while\r\nthe 19th and the five native regiments on the right charged the\r\ncavalry in front of them. The Mahrattas did not stand the shock,\r\nbut broke and fled, and at once the whole of the enemy’s force was\r\ndissolved in flight. The cavalry pursued for many miles, killing\r\ngreat numbers, and capturing many elephants and camels, and much\r\nbaggage. Thirty-eight guns and many standards fell into the hands of\r\nthe victors. The British loss amounted to 46 killed, 308 wounded\r\nand 7 missing. As at Assaye, the principal loss fell on the 74th and\r\n78th, who, between them, lost 13 killed, and 84 wounded. The 19th\r\nLight Dragoons had 6 men wounded. The battle of Argaum was fought on\r\na perfectly level plain intersected by small water courses, without\r\nany buildings or other natural obstacles between the two lines, after\r\nthey had been formed, and was carried out exactly like a field day as\r\nthen practised. The pursuit of the enemy by the British cavalry was\r\nmaintained for six miles, and was then taken up and continued by the\r\nallied Mysore and Nizam’s horse for another twenty miles. The loss\r\nof the enemy, in the battle and subsequent pursuit, was estimated at\r\nfive thousand men. At Assaye, the principal Mahratta loss fell on\r\nScindia’s troops; at Argaum the loss fell chiefly on the Berar forces.\r\n\r\nThe victory at Argaum effected a complete separation of the Mahratta\r\nconfederate chiefs. Scindia still had a considerable force in the\r\nfield, but it had ceased to be formidable after Assaye. The Berar\r\nRajah’s field army had disappeared, and his territories lay open to\r\nthe invading British force. Scindia’s capital was far off, and he\r\nmight yet give trouble, so Wellesley determined to finish once for\r\nall with the Berar Rajah, in order that he might be able to devote\r\nundivided attention to Scindia afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe day following the battle, Stevenson marched in pursuit of the\r\nenemy: Wellesley followed a day later, and the two divisions were\r\nre-united at Ellichpore on the 5th December. Thence they marched on\r\nGawilghur, a fortress of great strength, regarded as the key of the\r\nDeccan, in which the defeated infantry from Argaum had taken refuge.\r\nThe place was taken by assault on the 15th, with the loss of 13\r\nkilled, no wounded, and three missing. Fifty-two guns, together with\r\na great quantity of small arms and military stores, fell into the\r\nhands of the victors. Nagpore, the Berar Rajah’s capital, now lay\r\nopen to the British troops, and the Rajah hastened to sue for peace.\r\nThe negotiation was conducted with the decision that characterized\r\nall Wellesley’s actions, and peace was concluded at Deogam, on the\r\n17th, two days after the fall of Gawilghur. His hands being now free\r\non this side, Wellesley gave notice to Scindia, that, on the 27th, he\r\nshould regard the agreement for suspension of hostilities at an end,\r\nunless that Chief came to definite terms. Left without an ally, with\r\nhis armies defeated both in the North-West and in the Deccan, Scindia\r\nhad no hope of continuing the struggle with success, and peace was\r\nsigned in Wellesley’s camp on the 30th December, at Surjee Anjengaum.\r\n\r\nThus triumphantly ended a war which for boldness of conception of\r\ncampaign, rapidity of execution, the great extent over which it was\r\nwaged, and the hard fighting that characterized it both in the North\r\nand South, stands in marked contrast to any war we had previously\r\nwaged in India.\r\n\r\n  “The seat of war, extending over the continent of India exhibited\r\n  in the short space of four months as many general battles, eight\r\n  regular sieges and storming of fortresses, without including\r\n  that of Gwalior, which was not captured till the beginning of\r\n  the next year; in all of which British valour prevailed over\r\n  accumulated obstacles, the combination of formidable powers, and\r\n  every advantage arising from local position, military means and\r\n  numerical strength.... Their (the Mahratta) numerous armies,\r\n  amounting on an average to two hundred and fifty thousand men,\r\n  were defeated in every engagement; while the corps organized\r\n  by their French auxiliaries, consisting at the least of forty\r\n  thousand more, and upon whom the fullest reliance was placed,\r\n  were completely destroyed; in all which reverses the confederates\r\n  left in the hands of the victors upwards of one thousand\r\n  pieces of cannon, with ammunition, treasure and stores in\r\n  proportion.”[54]\r\n\r\nBut the most valuable result to England was that she learned from the\r\nAssaye campaign that she had in her army a General who was fit to\r\ncope with the best Generals of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe war was over, and arrangements were made for the return of the\r\ntroops to their quarters. Leaving Stevenson’s division, Wellesley\r\nturned southwards to Jaulna, which he reached on the 19th January\r\n1804. A few days before the conclusion of peace, in writing to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, Wellesley remarked: “The 19th Dragoons have now\r\nbetter horses than I have ever seen with them.” It was well that it\r\nwas so, for a severe effort was still required of them. The Nizam’s\r\ndominions were at that time infested with banditti, mostly disbanded\r\nsoldiers, who plundered the country in all directions, and had become\r\nso daring that they had not hesitated to attack detachments of\r\nBritish troops. On reaching Jaulna, news was brought to Wellesley of\r\na large body of freebooters who were plundering the country to the\r\nsouthward. Crossing the Godavery, he marched to Neemgaum, where, on\r\nthe 2nd February, he received information of the whereabouts of the\r\nmarauders. He accordingly made up a light flying column consisting\r\nof the 19th Light Dragoons and the rest of the cavalry that had\r\nbeen with him at Assaye, the remnants of the gallant 74th, a sepoy\r\nbattalion, and details from other sepoy regiments, 150 pioneers, and\r\nfour guns,[55] and marched on the 3rd, reaching Sailgaon on the 4th,\r\na distance of about thirty miles in a direct line. Marching again the\r\nsame night, he came up with the freebooters about 9 A.M. on the 5th.\r\nThe cavalry charged at once, slaying great numbers and dispersing\r\nthem, at the same time capturing their guns, camp, and stores. An\r\nunfortunate mishap occurred on this occasion. The 19th mistook\r\nsome of the allied Mahratta horse for the enemy, and charged them,\r\ncutting down two or three of them, and having one of their own number\r\ncut down, before the mistake was discovered. The achievement was\r\nremarkable for the long and rapid marching performed by the troops.\r\nWriting of it, two days later, Wellesley says:\r\n\r\n  “The exertion made by the troops is the greatest I ever\r\n  witnessed. Everything was over by 12 o’clock on the 5th, and, I\r\n  think that, by that time, the infantry must have marched 60 miles\r\n  from six in the morning of the 4th. We halted from 12 in the day\r\n  till 10 at night on the 4th, so that we marched 60 miles with\r\n  infantry in twenty hours.”\r\n\r\nWell might he add:\r\n\r\n  “I think we now begin to beat the Mahrattas in the celerity of\r\n  our movements.”\r\n\r\nThe force then marched for Poona.\r\n\r\nHardly had peace been secured, when Holkar, who had hitherto held\r\naloof, took the field. The 19th Light Dragoons took, however, no part\r\nin the campaign that followed, but remained encamped at Panwell near\r\nBombay till the end of 1804, when they marched for Arcot.\r\n\r\nIn 1807, the royal permission was given to the regiment to wear\r\na badge of the Elephant with the word “Assaye,” on colours and\r\nappointments, in commemoration of the gallantry displayed by the\r\nregiment in the battle and during the campaign. Nothing can be traced\r\nof the honorary standard presented to the regiment for Assaye There\r\ncan be no doubt that it was given to the 19th as it was to the 74th\r\nand 78th.\r\n\r\n      HORSE GUARDS,\r\n      _15th April 1807_.\r\n\r\n  MY LORD\r\n\r\n  I have received the Commander in Chief’s directions to inform\r\n  you, that the Marquis of Wellesley and Major General the Honble.\r\n  Sir Arthur Wellesley have represented to H.R.H. the distinguished\r\n  services of the 19th Light Dragoons in the course of the arduous\r\n  Campaigns which occurred during the period of his Lordship’s\r\n  Government in India, and have earnestly solicited permission,\r\n  that the Regiment may be distinguished by some emblematical Badge.\r\n\r\n  The Commander in Chief has with great satisfaction submitted this\r\n  representation to the King, and His Majesty has in consequence\r\n  thereof been most graciously pleased to approve of the “Elephant”\r\n  being used in Colours and Appointments of the 19th Light Dragoons\r\n  with the word “_Assaye_” superscribed, in Commemoration of the\r\n  Gallantry and good Conduct displayed in the Action fought at that\r\n  place on the 23rd of September 1803.\r\n\r\n  I have the honour to be &c.\r\n\r\n      HARRY CALVERT,\r\n      A.G.\r\n\r\n  General Visct. HOWE, K.B.\r\n  or O.C. 19th Light Dragoons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE VELLORE MUTINY\r\n\r\n1805-1807\r\n\r\n  Lieut. Colonel Gillespie--19th at Arcot--Mutiny of Vellore--A\r\n  military wonder--19th ordered to England--A quarter of a\r\n  century’s changes--The “terrors of the East”--Farewell\r\n  orders--19th land in England.\r\n\r\n      “‘Trumpeter, sound for the Light Dragoons,\r\n        Sound to saddle and spur,’ he said,\r\n      ‘He that is ready may ride with me,\r\n        And he that can may ride ahead.’”\r\n                                 --_Newbolt._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn January 1801, a second Lieut. Colonel had been added to the\r\nestablishment of the regiment, in the person of Major Edgar Hunter,\r\npromoted from the 2nd Dragoon Guards, without purchase. Lt. Colonel\r\nHunter remained in England, and never joined the regiment. The\r\nvacancy caused by Maxwell’s death at Assaye was filled for a time\r\nby the Governor General, at Sir Arthur Wellesley’s recommendation,\r\nappointing Lieutenant Colonel William Wallace of the 74th Highlanders\r\nto command the 19th Light Dragoons. But the appointment was\r\nnot confirmed in England, and, the following year, Wallace was\r\ntransferred to H.M. 80th, to make way for Major James Kennedy, who\r\nhad been promoted to fill the vacancy. A little later, Lieutenant\r\nColonel Sir Robert Wilson was brought from half-pay of Hompesch’s\r\nMounted Riflemen to be Lieutenant Colonel, in place of Hunter, who\r\nwas placed on half-pay. But Wilson also did not join the regiment,\r\nand, three months later, exchanged into the 20th Light Dragoons with\r\nLieutenant Colonel Robert Rollo Gillespie, who, during the short\r\ntime he was with the 19th, was destined to perform one of the most\r\ncurious feats of arms ever done by an individual.\r\n\r\nIn an age prolific of daring deeds Gillespie was already widely\r\nknown as the hero of many a desperate adventure. Headstrong and\r\nimpetuous by nature, in action he was a brave and gallant soldier\r\nto whom nothing appeared impossible. The only child of a Scotch\r\ngentleman settled in Ireland, at the age of ten Gillespie was\r\ngazetted as Ensign to the 45th Foot, from which he was transferred\r\nas Lieutenant to the 104th. On that regiment being disbanded in the\r\nbeginning of 1783, he was transferred as Cornet to the 6th Dragoon\r\nGuards, then quartered in Ireland. Four years later, he was concerned\r\nin an affair that attracted much notice at the time, and nearly\r\nbrought his military career to an abrupt close. While quartered at\r\nAthy in Kildare, an altercation took place one day in Gillespie’s\r\nroom, between one of his brother officers, named Mackenzie, and\r\na Mr Barrington, brother of Sir Jonah Barrington, whose estate\r\nwas in the neighbourhood. In a duelling age, the Barringtons were\r\nremarkable for their fire-eating propensities. A meeting was fixed\r\nupon for the following morning, Barrington insisting on fighting\r\nin a particular part of his family estate. Gillespie attended as\r\nsecond to Mackenzie. Shots were exchanged without result, and it was\r\nproposed by the seconds that the affair should be considered at an\r\nend. Barrington objected, and a fierce quarrel arose between him and\r\nGillespie. A challenge to fight on the spot was given and accepted.\r\nGillespie, knowing Barrington’s reputation as a duellist, drew out\r\nhis handkerchief, proposing that each should hold one end of it. Both\r\nfired at the same moment: Barrington fell shot through the heart, but\r\nGillespie escaped with only a slight wound, the bullet having glanced\r\noff a button. Gillespie was tried at the summer assizes of 1788, at\r\nMaryborough, for wilful murder, and acquitted by the jury, with a\r\nverdict of justifiable homicide.\r\n\r\nIn 1792, Gillespie was promoted to a Lieutenancy in the newly raised\r\n20th Light Dragoons, which was enlisted for service in Jamaica,\r\nand maintained at the expense of the island. In the attack of\r\nPort-au-Prince in St Domingo he distinguished himself, along with\r\nCaptain Rowley of the Navy, by swimming ashore, their swords in\r\ntheir mouths, as bearers of a flag of truce. They were fired on as\r\nthey swam, and would have been shot on landing, if Gillespie had not\r\nmade himself known as a freemason to the Governor, who was also a\r\nfellow craftsman. While in St Domingo, an attack at night was made on\r\nGillespie’s house by eight men. Awakened by the cries of his servant,\r\nwho was being murdered, he attacked the assailants with his sword,\r\nand killed six of them. The remaining two fled, after inflicting\r\na dangerous wound on him. On exchanging to the 19th, he obtained\r\npermission to find his way out to India overland, and travelled\r\nthrough Germany, which was then in the hands of the French, Austria,\r\nServia, Constantinople, where he fought a successful duel with a\r\nFrench Officer who picked a quarrel with him, Aleppo and Baghdad. The\r\njourney was a hazardous one at that time, and he had more than one\r\nnarrow escape. On reaching Arcot, the command of the whole garrison\r\ndevolved on him, in virtue of his brevet rank. Hardly had he assumed\r\nthe command, when an event occurred at the neighbouring station of\r\nVellore that will always be associated with Gillespie’s name.\r\n\r\nMatters relating to food, dress and other petty details of social\r\nlife, which in Europe are treated as matters of personal caprice,\r\nhave, in the East, become so intermingled with religious observances,\r\nthat they have, in the course of time, come to be regarded as an\r\nessential part of the religion of the people, and of paramount\r\nimportance in the conduct of their lives. Nowhere are these\r\nquasi-religious observances so tenaciously held as in India, and\r\nnowhere do they relate more to matters which in other countries\r\nare held to be of trivial importance. The lesson is one that is\r\ncontinually forcing itself on the notice of Indian administrators,\r\nand is continually being forgotten.[56]\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Seringapatam, in 1799, the strong fortress of\r\nVellore was selected to be the place of residence of the numerous\r\nfamily of Tippoo Sultan. Beyond being required to reside in Vellore,\r\nthey were under no restraint. They were in receipt of large money\r\nallowances from the British Government, and they had gathered around\r\nthem a swarm of needy followers who were ripe for any mischief. In\r\nNovember 1805, Lieutenant General Sir J. Cradock, who had assumed the\r\ncommand of the forces in Madras a few months earlier, issued an order\r\nestablishing a new pattern of turbans for the native army. Two months\r\nlater, a volume of regulations for the army was issued from the\r\nAdjutant General’s office, in which Native soldiers were forbidden\r\nfrom wearing caste marks on their faces while in uniform, and the\r\nshaving and trimming of beards and mustachios was prescribed, in a\r\nmanner to assimilate sepoys to English soldiers. In April, made-up\r\npatterns of the new turbans were sent to different regiments. The\r\nmen took it into their heads that these turbans closely resembled\r\nthe hats worn by half-castes and native Christians; and, connecting\r\nthis with the orders about caste marks and shaving, leaped to the\r\nconclusion that their forcible conversion to Christianity was\r\nintended. A sepoy battalion at Vellore at once made known their\r\nrefusal to wear the turban. The Commander-in-Chief, unable to\r\nunderstand the feelings aroused by his orders, treated the refusal\r\nas a mere matter of insubordination. The battalion was sent away\r\nfrom Vellore, another being brought in its place; and a number of\r\nnon-commissioned officers and men in the battalion were punished.\r\nHardly had this taken place, when it became known that in other\r\nplaces the same objections to the new turban had been manifested. The\r\nattention of Government was now roused, but still nothing was done to\r\nrepeal the obnoxious order. The punishment that had been meted out\r\nto the battalion at Vellore only served to confirm the fears of the\r\nrest of the native garrison. Meetings were held, at which retainers\r\nof the Mysore princes attended, and did their best to foment\r\nmischief and increase the fears of the sepoys, while at the same\r\ntime communications were opened with other sepoys in the different\r\nMadras garrisons, encouraging them to combine in resisting the attack\r\non their religion. In the beginning of July, the garrison of the\r\nfort consisted of four companies of H.M.’s 69th regiment amounting\r\nto 11 officers and 372 rank and file, and a battalion and a half\r\nof sepoys, amounting to 35 native officers and 1775 rank and file,\r\nwith their European officers. A considerable number of the sepoys\r\nlived in the pettah, their arms being kept in the fort. The fort and\r\ngarrison were under the command of Colonel Fancourt of H.M.’s 34th\r\nRegt. No suspicion existed that any danger threatened; while the\r\nGovernment departments were still corresponding with each other, and\r\ndeliberating about the new turban, and the feeling it had caused in\r\nthe native army, without further warning, the storm burst.\r\n\r\nIt happened that a field day for one of the sepoy battalions had been\r\nordered for the early morning of the 10th July. It was customary on\r\nsuch occasions for the sepoys, instead of remaining in their huts\r\nin the pettah, to sleep inside the fort, in order to get under arms\r\nwithout delay in the morning. The sepoy guards inside the fort\r\nwere furnished by the other native battalion. So favourable did the\r\nopportunity appear to the mutineers, that it led to a premature\r\nexplosion of the plot that had been formed in concert with sepoys\r\nin other stations. At three o’clock in the morning of the 10th, a\r\ngeneral attack by the sepoys was suddenly made on the men of the 69th\r\nand the European officers in the fort. At the same moment, the guards\r\nand sentries were attacked and overpowered, the sick men in hospital\r\nmassacred, the officers’ quarters surrounded and fired into, while\r\nthe principal body of mutineers poured volley after volley into the\r\nbarracks where the 69th were sleeping, and brought two fieldpieces\r\nto play on them, obtained from the magazine. The men surprised and\r\nshot down in their sleep, and without officers, could do little more\r\nthan shelter themselves as they best might, and hold the entrance\r\nto the barracks. Colonel Fancourt, with several other officers, was\r\nshot down at once, and the complete massacre of every European in\r\nthe fort appeared inevitable. Without waiting for the completion of\r\ntheir work, the mutineers brought out one of the sons of Tippoo, and\r\nproclaimed him Sultan, hoisting at the same time a Mysore flag that\r\nhad been prepared for the occasion.\r\n\r\nIn the confusion and darkness, a few officers and a sergeant of the\r\n69th, named Brady, managed to meet in the quarters of one of the\r\nofficers. After maintaining themselves some time, they broke out and\r\nforced their way into the 69th barracks, on which a heavy fire was\r\nstill kept up. Having rallied the survivors, they sallied out through\r\nthe windows, and gained the adjoining ramparts under a heavy fire. It\r\nwas now broad daylight, and the men, who had had at the outset only\r\nsix cartridges each, had scarcely any ammunition left. Nevertheless,\r\nthey made their way along the ramparts, driving the mutineers before\r\nthem, till they reached the Magazine which was on the opposite\r\nside of the fort. Finding that all the ball ammunition had been\r\nalready removed by the mutineers, they retraced their steps as far\r\nas the work over the main gateway, after pulling down the rebel\r\nflag. Here they resolved to make their last stand, their numbers\r\ngreatly reduced, the only unwounded officers left being two Assistant\r\nSurgeons, and the whole party being exposed to a continual fire to\r\nwhich they were scarcely able to respond. They had obtained a few\r\ncartridges from the pouches of dead mutineers, with which they still\r\nkept up a feeble appearance of defence. In the confusion of making\r\ntheir way along the ramparts to the Magazine, some thirty men of the\r\n69th, with two or three officers, got separated from the main body.\r\nFinding a rope suspended from the wall, which had been used to admit\r\nmutinous sepoys, they let themselves down by it, and took refuge in a\r\nsmall detached redoubt, where Lt. Colonel Forbes with a few unarmed\r\nsepoys who had remained faithful, had taken post. Hopeless as the\r\nwhole situation appeared at this juncture, help was fast approaching.\r\nIt happened that Major Coates of the 69th and several of the native\r\ninfantry officers resided outside the walls. On being aroused by the\r\nfiring and tumult, and being unable to enter the fort, Coates guessed\r\nwhat had happened, and at once dispatched an officer to Arcot with a\r\nletter to Gillespie.\r\n\r\nGillespie had appointed that very morning to ride over to Arcot,\r\nto breakfast with Colonel Fancourt. He had mounted his horse at\r\ndaybreak, and started on his ride, accompanied by Captain Wilson of\r\nthe 19th, when he was met by Coates’ messenger riding at full speed,\r\nwho told him that the gates of the fortress were shut, that there\r\nwas heavy firing and a dreadful noise within. Making at once for\r\nthe Cavalry lines, Gillespie was in a few minutes hastily galloping\r\nalong the road to Vellore, at the head of a squadron of the 19th\r\nunder Captain Wilson, and a troop of the 7th Native Cavalry, leaving\r\norders for the rest of the cavalry and the galloper guns of the 19th\r\nto follow as soon as possible, under Lieut. Colonel Kennedy. As the\r\ntroopers approached the walls, they were seen by the little party who\r\nstill held out over the gateway. The 69th had been in Jamaica four\r\nyears before. To Sergeant Bradys astonishment, he beheld at the head\r\nof the little band of dragoons the well-known Colonel Gillespie, whom\r\nhe had seen only a short time before in the West Indies. “If Colonel\r\nGillespie be alive, God Almighty has sent him from the West Indies\r\nto save our lives in the East!” he exclaimed. The moment was indeed\r\nmost critical. The small party over the gateway had fired their last\r\ncartridge, and the sepoys, who for a time had dispersed to plunder,\r\nwere gathering to complete their work. On seeing the relief party\r\nadvancing, a great number of the mutineers retired to the further\r\nramparts, leaving the gateway and one bastion in possession of the\r\nlittle party under Sergeant Brady. The entrance to the fortress was\r\nthrough four successive gates. The two outer gates were fortunately\r\nopen, and the drawbridge was down. Encouraged by Gillespie, some of\r\nthe 69th let themselves down by their pouch and bayonet belts, and\r\nopened the third gate from within, not without losing several of\r\ntheir number, but the fourth and the strongest gate was beyond their\r\npowers. In order to open it, Gillespie formed the desperate expedient\r\nof forcing the wicket and opening the gate from the inside. The\r\nwicket was forced, and Gillespie for a brief interval, accompanied\r\nby Captain Wilson and three men on foot, stood inside the fort,\r\nexposed to the fire of the square and palace yard full of men. But\r\ntheir efforts to break the locks and force the bars were fruitless,\r\nand, seeing that perseverance in the attempt could only end in their\r\ndestruction, the little party withdrew. Still casting about for some\r\nmeans of joining the party over the gateway, Gillespie suddenly\r\nspied a rope. The end was at once thrown up and secured, and in a\r\nfew minutes, by its assistance, Gillespie joined the remnants of the\r\n69th over the gateway. Seeing a pair of regimental colours on the\r\nwall Gillespie seized them, and, collecting as many of the 69th as\r\nhe could find, at once headed a bayonet charge against a three gun\r\nbattery, out of which the enemy were driven. Though there was not\r\na single round of ammunition procurable, a gun, turned round and\r\npointed towards the mutineers, held them in check, at a time when\r\nevery minute was valuable. But the effect did not last long, and just\r\nas it seemed as if no further effort could be made to stave off the\r\nimpending fate of the party, the remainder of the 19th with their\r\ngalloper guns suddenly appeared at the gate. Forcing his way back to\r\nthe wall above the gateway, Gillespie gave orders for the gate to be\r\nburst open, which was done with the first shot. The great square was\r\nfull of men ready to dispute the entrance of the cavalry, and the\r\nentrance being very narrow, and moreover being commanded by two guns,\r\nGillespie called on the remnant of the 69th for one final effort.\r\nPutting himself at their head, a gallant bayonet charge was made to\r\nclear the entrance for the cavalry, which was attended with further\r\nloss. The dragoons poured in, headed by Captain Skelton of the 19th,\r\nand supported loyally by some of the 7th native cavalry, and the\r\nwork of retribution commenced. Between three and four hundred of the\r\nmutineers were cut down in the fort, while numbers, who escaped by a\r\nsally port, were caught and slain outside, by a squadron of the 19th\r\nunder Lieutenant Young, and a party of the 7th Native Cavalry under\r\nLieutenant Woodhouse. One party of mutineers maintained themselves\r\nfor some time in one of the barracks, firing on all who approached;\r\ntill some of the 19th dismounted and stormed the building, putting\r\nthem all to the sword. By 10 o’clock all was over, and the safety of\r\nthe fortress secured, but Gillespie has left it on record that, had\r\nhe delayed scaling the wall for five minutes, none of those inside\r\nthe fort could have escaped. The loss of the 69th amounted to 115\r\nrank and file killed, and 76 wounded. Of the officers of different\r\nregiments, fifteen were killed and five wounded. Several, who had\r\nbeen unable to make their way to the 69th barracks, saved themselves\r\nby concealment during the tumult. Among the 19th Light Dragoons, one\r\ntrooper was killed and three wounded, a loss that would have been\r\nmuch greater but for the gallantry of the 69th in clearing a space\r\nfor the cavalry to form in after entering the fort. Gillespie was\r\naccidentally ridden down by a dragoon, and badly bruised, in the\r\n_mêlée_.\r\n\r\nInvestigation showed that the sepoys in many other stations were\r\nprepared to mutiny, and, but for the failure at Vellore, which\r\nwas the centre of disaffection, would have risen. By Gillespie’s\r\nresolution and intrepidity in stamping out the mutiny before it could\r\ngather force, a great and unexpected danger had been averted. Well\r\nmight the Commander-in-Chief say that Gillespie had performed “a\r\nmilitary wonder.” The princes of Tippoo’s family were at once sent\r\ndown to Madras, escorted by the 19th Light Dragoons, and embarked for\r\nCalcutta, on board the _Culloden_, on the 30th. The 19th remained in\r\nMadras three days, encamped by the Race Stand, and then returned to\r\nArcot. Gillespie was employed at Wallajabad and other places where\r\ndangerous symptoms of disaffection had appeared. At the same time, he\r\nwas appointed to be Inspector and Exercising officer of Cavalry in\r\nthe Presidency, but the appointment was discontinued as unnecessary,\r\na year later, by the Court of Directors. To show their appreciation\r\nof his services, the Court of Directors granted Gillespie a money\r\nreward of £2500. A proportionate sum was granted to Sergeant Brady,\r\nwho was also recommended for a Commission, and each non-commissioned\r\nand private of the 19th Light Dragoons who had been employed at\r\nVellore, received a gratuity of one month’s pay. Suitable rewards\r\nwere also given to the men of the native cavalry, who behaved loyally\r\non the occasion. In consequence of the mutiny, both the Governor and\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief were recalled to England.\r\n\r\nGillespie’s connection with the 19th practically terminated three\r\nmonths later, when the regiment left India, and the rest of his\r\ncareer does not come within the scope of this history. On the\r\nregiment sailing for England, he remained in India, and, in the\r\nfollowing year, exchanged into the 8th Light Dragoons with Lieut.\r\nColonel John Ormsby Vandeleur. His gallant deeds at the conquest of\r\nJava, and subsequently, while in command of the troops there, can\r\nnever be forgotten. His death was in keeping with his whole life.\r\nHe fell under the walls of Kalunga in the Deyrah Dhoon, on the 31st\r\nOctober 1814, at the beginning of the first Nepaul War, while vainly\r\ntrying to force an entrance at the head of some dismounted dragoons,\r\nafter the first attack had failed. His remains were carried to Meerut\r\nfor interment. By the irony of fate, on the 10th May 1857, the first\r\nshots of the great sepoy mutiny were fired within a mile of the\r\nmonument over his grave, and were the beginning of events that at\r\none time threatened to involve British power in the East in ruin,\r\nand that have changed the whole course of Indian history. If that\r\ngallant spirit was still permitted to take interest in the events of\r\nthat day, how it must have chafed at the exhibition of incapacity and\r\nindecision that led to such disastrous consequences. In view of what\r\nhappened at Vellore, it is allowable to believe that the Great Mutiny\r\nof 1857 would never have assumed the proportions it did, had the\r\nfirst outbreak been met by the same display of energy and resolution\r\nas was shown, under similar circumstances, fifty-one years earlier.\r\nOn the 2nd January 1815, before the news of his death reached\r\nEngland, Gillespie was gazetted as K.C.B. A monument to his memory,\r\nby Chantrey, was erected in St Paul’s Cathedral, at the expense of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Major General R. R. Gillespie_\r\n\r\n_from a miniature in the possession of his grandson Colonel\r\nGillespie._\r\n\r\n  _G. Chinnery, pinx._\r\n  _Walker & Boutall, ph. sc._]\r\n\r\nThe time had now arrived when the 19th was to bring to a close its\r\nlong and distinguished career in India. Orders were received for\r\nthe regiment to march to Madras, for embarkation to Europe by the\r\nnext homeward bound fleet. At Poonamallee, on 5th October, they made\r\nover their horses to the 25th Light Dragoons, who had been brought\r\ndown from Bengal, by sea, to take their place. In the twenty-four\r\nyears that had elapsed since the regiment had landed in India, great\r\nwere the changes it had witnessed. At the time of its arrival, the\r\nvery existence of the British settlements in Southern India hung\r\nby a thread. England had then been at war with France, and the two\r\ncountries were still at war. But the conditions were changed. Now\r\nthe French flag had disappeared from India, and not a single native\r\npower dared meet a British army in the field, without risking its\r\nown existence. From a trading corporation the East India Company had\r\ngrown into a great and powerful government, whose supremacy in India\r\nwas unchallenged. In achieving this result, the 19th Light Dragoons\r\nhad played no small part. On their first arrival in India the\r\nprevailing sentiment with which they were regarded was curiosity. The\r\nhorsemen of native powers were numbered by tens of thousands. Their\r\nmethod was to waste and ravage the country round an enemy’s force, to\r\nharass the line of march, to cut off stragglers, to intercept convoys\r\nand to wear down an enemy by these indirect methods. To charge home,\r\nsword in hand, into the ranks of an unbroken enemy was foreign to\r\ntheir ideas of properly conducted warfare. The first appearance of\r\nthe 19th in the field came therefore as a surprise to friend and\r\nfoe; it was like the introduction of a new weapon. Before the first\r\ncampaign against Tippoo was six months old, the reputation of the\r\n19th Light Dragoons had penetrated to every part of southern India.\r\nThe impression thus created grew with every successive appearance of\r\nthe regiment in the field of action; and, as long as they remained in\r\nIndia, they continued to evoke an amount of interest and attention\r\nthat was bestowed on no other regiment in the service. One who\r\ncharged with them at Assaye and Argaum, and fought his way into\r\nVellore with them, though not belonging to the regiment, wrote of\r\nthe nineteenth as “a fine specimen of what a regiment ought to be.\r\nThey called themselves the ‘Terrors of the East.’ Indeed, such was\r\nthe respect in which they were held by the natives, that when they\r\nembarked for England, all the black town of Madras was emptied to see\r\nthem off.” Before sailing, an entertainment in their honour was given\r\nby the Commander-in-Chief, and the subjoined orders were published:--\r\n\r\n  _General Order (Madras Govt.)._\r\n\r\n  _Fort St. George, October 10th, 1806._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1806.]\r\n\r\n  On the occasion of the intended return of His Majesty’s 19th\r\n  regiment of light dragoons to Europe, the right honourable the\r\n  governor in council feels the greatest satisfaction in testifying\r\n  in the most public manner, his highest approbation of that\r\n  distinguished and valuable corps. From the period of the arrival\r\n  of his majesty’s 19th dragoons in India, in the year 1782, until\r\n  the present time, that regiment has shared in almost every action\r\n  of difficulty and of glory, in which the British arms have\r\n  been engaged during that long and eventful interval, and has\r\n  deservedly established a degree of reputation seldom equalled,\r\n  never surpassed. His lordship in council deems it unnecessary\r\n  at this moment to enumerate the various instances in which his\r\n  majesty’s 19th dragoons have rendered the most important service\r\n  to their country: but the glory acquired by that regiment in the\r\n  field of Assaye, and the important advantages which resulted\r\n  from its bravery, discipline and activity, on a late memorable\r\n  occasion, (furnish?) an instance which cannot be omitted, and\r\n  which can never be obliterated from the annals of this country,\r\n  or from the memory of the British nation. His lordship in council\r\n  was pleased, by a general order under date the 27th August, 1805,\r\n  to confer a particular mark of his lordship’s approbation on his\r\n  majesty’s 74th regiment, at the period of the embarkation of\r\n  that distinguished corps for Europe, by granting to the officers\r\n  a donation of three months’ full batta. Impressed with similar\r\n  sentiments on the present occasion, his lordship in council\r\n  has, in consideration of the long and brilliant services of his\r\n  majesty’s 19th regiment of dragoons, resolved to extend to the\r\n  officers of that regiment a donation of the same amount, which is\r\n  accordingly directed to be paid previously to their departure.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _General Order. (Lieut. General Sir J. Cradock)_\r\n\r\n  _Head Quarters, Choultry Plain,_\r\n\r\n  _Oct. 13th, 1806._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1806.]\r\n\r\n  The eulogium that government has been pleased to express in\r\n  their late order upon the services of his majesty’s 19th light\r\n  dragoons, throughout its long and distinguished course in\r\n  this Country, leaves to the commander-in-chief but little to\r\n  add, except his warmest wishes for the continuance of their\r\n  uninterrupted honor and success, in other regions of the British\r\n  Empire. The records of government everywhere proclaim the value\r\n  of his majesty’s 19th light dragoons, in India, and stamp\r\n  the occasions, where this regiment has perhaps secured the\r\n  foundations of our empire.\r\n\r\n  Such subjects belong to the highest authority, and have only\r\n  been briefly mentioned with grateful acknowledgment. The bounded\r\n  limits of an order were unequal to the history.\r\n\r\n  It therefore only remains with the commander-in-chief, to\r\n  state the humbler sentiments of approbation of the discipline,\r\n  good order, obedience, and harmony that prevail in the 19th\r\n  light dragoons, which confirm all opinion, that such are the\r\n  foundations that lead to glory, cause admiration and respect,\r\n  while a regiment remains in a foreign country, and ensures to\r\n  them, on their departure the deepest regret.\r\n\r\nAnd so, on the 20th October 1806, twenty-four years to a day since\r\nthey first arrived in Madras, the 19th Light Dragoons with their\r\nhonours thick upon them, embarked in the _Streatham_, _William\r\nPitt_, and _Jane Duchess of Gordon_, to sail for England three days\r\nlater, under convoy of the squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Sir\r\nEdward Pellew. The voyage was uneventful. Table Bay was reached\r\n30th December, and St Helena 23rd January. On the 18th April 1807,\r\nthe regiment disembarked at Tilbury, one detachment being landed at\r\nPlymouth, and marched to Northampton. A muster taken a week after\r\nlanding shows the strength of the regiment to have been 245 rank\r\nand file. Recruiting parties were at once sent out to Birmingham,\r\nGlasgow, Dublin and Waterford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nWAR WITH UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n1808-1813\r\n\r\n  19th in Ireland--United States declare War--19th\r\n  ordered to Canada--United States’ plans--Operations of\r\n  1812--Mackinaw--Detroit--Armistice--Battle of Queenston\r\n  Heights--General Brock killed--Montreal threatened--Operations\r\n  of 1813--Proctor’s victory at Frenchtown--Fort Meigs--United\r\n  States’ victory on Lake Erie--Battle of the Thames; Proctor’s\r\n  defeat--York captured--Fort George and Erie evacuated--Stoney\r\n  Creek: Harvey’s brilliant exploit--Fitzgibbon’s success at Beaver\r\n  Dam--Arrival of squadron of 19th on Niagara frontier--Engagement\r\n  on Lake Ontario--Fort George re-occupied--Fort Niagara\r\n  surprised--Black Rock and Buffalo captured--Abortive attack\r\n  on Sackett’s Harbour--United States’ operations against\r\n  Montreal--Battle of Chateaugay--Battle of Chrystler’s\r\n  Farm--Importance of Kingston and Sackett’s Harbour.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the following six years the regiment remained at home,\r\nand took no part in the stirring events then occurring in Spain\r\nand Portugal. At the end of 1808, they moved from Northampton to\r\nNorwich and Ipswich, with a detachment at Birmingham, while their\r\nrecruiting parties were actively engaged in different parts of the\r\nUnited Kingdom. In March 1809, the regiment moved to Romford, and, in\r\nDecember, embarked for Ireland. For two years the regiment remained\r\nin quarters at Tullamore, Philipstown and Longford. By an order dated\r\n23rd April 1811, the establishment was augmented from 400 to 570\r\nprivates, making the total strength of all ranks 685. In March 1812,\r\nthe regiment marched to Clonmel, and in June, to Dublin. The regiment\r\nwas soon to proceed on active service again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING’S GUIDON.\r\n\r\nSQUADRON GUIDON.\r\n\r\nGUIDONS OF THE XIX^{TH} LIGHT DRAGOONS.\r\n\r\n  _to face p. 172._]\r\n\r\nOn the 18th June, 1812, the United States declared war against\r\nEngland. The declaration reached the British Government on the 30th\r\nJuly; but, as the British Orders in Council respecting the trade of\r\nneutral nations, that had been put forward on the American side as\r\nthe chief reason for the war, had been rescinded on 23rd June, it\r\nwas still believed in England that peace would be maintained. In\r\nspite of the hostilities that immediately commenced, it was not till\r\nOctober that conditional orders for reprisals were issued, and the\r\nformal declaration of war by Great Britain was not made till 9th\r\nJanuary 1813. The war party in the States had the upper hand at the\r\ntime: they were determined on war, and cared little for the pretext.\r\nTo outward appearance, it seemed, in 1812, that England could not\r\nmuch longer hold out against Napoleon, who had the whole continent\r\nof Europe, except Russia, at his feet, while the British armies in\r\nSpain seemed to make no progress. In truth Napoleon’s power was\r\nalready beginning to totter. The British armies in Spain, hardened\r\nand consolidated by three years of war under their great leader, were\r\ninvincible. Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz had fallen, and Wellington had\r\nalready begun his victorious advance that was to carry him across the\r\nPyrenees. At the same time Napoleon was preparing for his disastrous\r\ninvasion of Russia which dealt the first deadly blow to his power.\r\nBut the war party in the United States were unable to discern this.\r\nThe British troops in Canada were few in number, the colonists were\r\nbelieved to be lukewarm in their loyalty to Great Britain, and the\r\nwar party promised their countrymen that Canada would prove an easy\r\nprey. Under the thin veil of resenting injuries a war of conquest was\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nOn 6th March 1813, an order was issued for three squadrons of the\r\n19th Light Dragoons, completed to eighty rank and file per troop,\r\nto be held in readiness to embark for North America, under Lieut.\r\nColonel the Hon. J. O’Neill. The horses of the officers, sergeants\r\nand corporals were to be taken, but all other horses were to be left\r\nbehind. In the same month the regiment reached Cork, and embarked\r\non 4th April, in company with other troops, under convoy of the\r\n_Sybelle_ frigate and _Cygnet_ sloop; almost the first reinforcements\r\nsent from England to Canada since the United States’ declaration of\r\nwar. They reached Quebec about the 17th May,[57] and were at once\r\nsent to La Prairie on the St Lawrence near Montreal.\r\n\r\nThe war in which the regiment was about to engage, was one in which\r\ncavalry could play only a subordinate part. The country in which\r\nthey were to operate was a vast expanse of forest and swamp, with a\r\nfew sparsely inhabited clearings. The chief mode of communication\r\nwas by boat. The war was one to be fought out by small bodies of men\r\nfar from their supports, wielding the axe and the oar as much as the\r\nrifle: forage was hard to get, and there was little place for mounted\r\nmen. Under these conditions, the 19th Light Dragoons were only\r\nengaged in small detachments, never more than a squadron, seldom more\r\nthan a troop. Their duties were of a most harassing kind, on outpost\r\nand reconnoissance duty. Never once did they have an opportunity of\r\ncrossing swords with the enemy’s cavalry. The only cavalry charges\r\nrecorded during the war were those made by the United States’ cavalry\r\nthat overwhelmed Proctor’s force at the battle of the Thames, and the\r\ncharge repulsed by the 89th at Chrystler’s Farm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CANADIAN FRONTIER\r\n\r\nin 1812.\r\n\r\n  _Walker & Boutall sc._]\r\n\r\nImmediately on landing, one troop, taking with it only ten horses,\r\nwas dispatched to Upper Canada. With it went Lieut. Colonel O’Neill\r\nand a convoy of ammunition. The three hundred horses, that were to\r\nhave been ready by 1st July, had not been obtained. A fortnight\r\nlater, a second troop followed, with sixty-five horses, most of\r\nwhich had been brought from Ireland with the regiment. The squadron\r\nwas destined for the Niagara frontier, where it was engaged, under\r\nCaptain Lisle, till the end of the war.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in spite of the belief in England that war would not\r\nbe prosecuted by the States, when the rescinding of the orders in\r\nCouncil was known, hostilities had been in active progress from the\r\nfirst declaration. The British regular troops in Canada, in June\r\n1812, were about 4500 in number; of which 3000 were in garrison at\r\nQuebec and Montreal, the remainder being scattered along the Upper\r\nCanada frontier. Their small number was effectively supplemented\r\nby the Canadian militia, who fought for the protection of their\r\nhomes with a gallantry and devotion that could not be exceeded.\r\nTheir numbers were however liable to constant fluctuations owing\r\nto the frequent necessity for their presence at their homes for\r\nagricultural purposes. A considerable number of Indians also, at\r\ntimes, co-operated; allies of doubtful value, who could never be\r\nrelied on, and whose numbers varied from day to day. In population\r\nand resources the United States were in the proportion of more than\r\nten to one compared to Canada. On the British side therefore the war\r\nwas necessarily of a defensive character. The points on which Canada\r\nwas most vulnerable were, 1. on the Detroit frontier between Lake\r\nHuron and Lake Erie; 2. on the Niagara frontier between Lake Erie and\r\nLake Ontario; and, 3. on the line of the St Lawrence between Kingston\r\nand Montreal. The United States’ plan was to invade Canada on all\r\nthree points, and three separate expeditions were prepared for the\r\npurpose. The first attack was made on the Detroit frontier, where,\r\nunder pretence of punishing some Indians, troops had been assembled\r\nbefore the declaration of war.\r\n\r\nBefore noticing the more important operations of 1812, it is\r\nnecessary to mention the capture of the United States’ fort and\r\nisland of Mackinaw, which was effected by a party of regulars,\r\nmilitia and Indians, under Captain Roberts, on 17th July, and\r\nretained till the end of the war. The capture was of some importance,\r\nas the island commanded the navigation between Lakes Michigan and\r\nHuron.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th July, a United States’ force of 2500 men, under General\r\nHull, crossed from Detroit, and occupied the small village of\r\nSandwich. On the same day Hull issued a proclamation that struck the\r\nkeynote of the war. In it he called on the Canadians to seek his\r\nprotection, threatening them with a war of extermination should they\r\nventure to take up arms against him. Acting in the spirit of this\r\nproclamation, the United States’ troops throughout the war committed\r\nexcesses against the non-combatant population that had long been\r\ncondemned by all civilized nations, and effectually alienated any\r\nsympathy they might have found among the Canadians. The reprisals,\r\nthat are inevitable in such cases, followed, and the war was marked\r\nby a rancour on both sides, that contrasted strongly with the more\r\ndecorous but not less deadly warfare that was being waged by French\r\nand British troops in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe small British force of 350 men in the neighbourhood of Detroit,\r\nconsisting mainly of militia, and not counting Indians, were gathered\r\nat Amherstberg under Lieutenant Colonel Proctor. Hull, instead\r\nof advancing at once, and overwhelming it, remained at Sandwich,\r\nindulging in petty outpost affairs. Proctor passed a small force\r\nacross the river, and cut off his supplies, which forced Hull to\r\nwithdraw his force, on the 7th August, from the Canadian side, and\r\nretreat to Detroit. On the 12th, Major General Brock, commanding\r\nin Upper Canada, reached Amherstberg with three hundred men, and,\r\nthree days later, crossed the river, and advanced on Detroit. On the\r\n16th, Hull capitulated with his whole force. Over fifteen hundred\r\nprisoners, thirty-three guns, 2500 stands of arms and the Michigan\r\nterritory passed into the hands of the British.\r\n\r\nAt this time a lull in the war took place through the action\r\nof Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, Governor, and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of Canada, who, throughout the war, was the\r\nevil genius of the British cause. In the United States’ manifesto\r\nthe British Orders in Council had been put forward as the chief\r\ncause of the war. On hearing that the orders had been repealed, Sir\r\nGeorge Prevost believed that the war would not be persevered with.\r\nHe accordingly, in spite of the hostilities that had occurred,\r\nproposed an armistice to the United States’ commander of the force\r\nthreatening Montreal, till the latter should receive further orders\r\nfrom Washington. But the United States’ government were determined\r\non war, and hostilities were resumed on 8th September. The armistice\r\nwas of much advantage to the States, as, while it lasted, they were\r\nable to convey without hindrance, by water, the supplies collected\r\nat Oswego for the use of their troops destined to act on the Niagara\r\nfrontier, at a time when the British had an undoubted superiority on\r\nLake Ontario.\r\n\r\nThe United States’ force threatening the line between Lakes Erie and\r\nOntario numbered 6300 men, under General Van Rensselaar. To oppose\r\nthem, Major General Brock had but 1200 men (by one account 1500),\r\na large proportion of which were militia and Indians. These troops\r\nwere posted at Fort Erie and Fort George, the two extreme points of\r\nthe line, with a few companies at Queenston and one or two other\r\npoints to command landing places. Early in the morning of the 13th\r\nOctober, about 1600 United States’ troops crossed at Queenston, and\r\nmade good their footing. In the course of the fighting General Brock\r\nfell at the head of his men, and the United States’ commander was\r\nbadly wounded. Reinforcements coming up, in the afternoon, from Fort\r\nGeorge, under Major General Sheaffe, brought the British-Canadian\r\nforce on the spot up to about 1000 men including Indians. An attack\r\nwas made on the enemy’s position: they were driven into their boats,\r\nand the United States’ General Wadsworth, with 958 officers and\r\nmen were made prisoners. One gun and a colour were also captured.\r\nThe loss on the British side cannot be exactly stated. Besides the\r\nGeneral, one officer was killed and two wounded. Among the rank and\r\nfile there were about 16 killed and 70 wounded, and about a dozen\r\nIndians: but the success was dearly bought with the death of Sir\r\nIsaac Brock.[58]\r\n\r\nAt one in the morning of 28th November, another attempt was made\r\nto cross, about two miles below Fort Erie. But the crossing was\r\nmismanaged, and the whole attempt carried out in a half-hearted way.\r\nAfter inflicting and sustaining some loss, the United States’ troops\r\nre-embarked, and thus ended for the year all serious operations on\r\nthis part of the frontier.\r\n\r\nThe United States’ force intended to operate against Montreal was\r\nequally unsuccessful. Assembled at Plattsburg on Lake Champlain,\r\nabout 7000 strong, under General Dearborn, it advanced to the\r\nfrontier on 15th November. On this being known in Montreal, the\r\navailable troops, about 1900 strong more than half of which were\r\nmilitia, advanced to La Prairie. Nothing however occurred beyond an\r\nunimportant skirmish between small detachments, after which, Dearborn\r\nretreated to Plattsburg, and went into quarters for the winter. Thus\r\nended hostilities for the year. At every point the United States’\r\nforces had been foiled by inferior numbers. Fort Detroit and the\r\nState of Michigan, together with the island of Mackinaw, commanding\r\nthe navigation between Lakes Michigan and Huron, remained in British\r\nhands. The only real success gained by the United States was in the\r\nnaval strength they had been able to develop on the Lakes, owing\r\nto superior resources, and to the absence of any assistance to\r\nCanada from England. The superiority thus bloodlessly established\r\nhad important results on the subsequent course of the war in Upper\r\nCanada. By sea, successes were scored by the United States in five\r\nfrigate duels, mainly due to the superior size and armament of the\r\nUnited States’ ships. Effectual measures were then taken in England,\r\nand the United States’ flag practically disappeared from the high\r\nseas for the rest of the war. The complete mastery of the sea by\r\nGreat Britain caused the U.S. government to direct their naval\r\nresources to the Canadian lakes, a result that had an important\r\nbearing on the succeeding years’ warfare.\r\n\r\nThe United States’ plan of operations for the following year was, as\r\nbefore, to invade Canada with three separate corps. The first was\r\ndestined to retake Detroit, and acquire possession of Amherstberg.\r\nThe second attack was to be made from the eastern end of Lake\r\nOntario, to capture Kingston and Toronto, then known as York, and\r\nthen, in co-operation with a force collected at Buffalo, to act\r\nagainst Forts George and Erie on the Niagara frontier. The third\r\nwas to operate against Montreal, by a combined advance from the\r\nneighbourhood of Plattsburg, and from the eastern end of Ontario.\r\n\r\nOn the Detroit frontier the Canadian forces numbered about 2,300 men,\r\nmore than half of which were Indians, under Colonel Proctor; opposed\r\nto a U.S. force of double that number, under General Harrison.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th January, a force of 1000 men under General Winchester,\r\nadvancing from Sandusky, drove in the British picquets at Frenchtown,\r\nforty-five miles from Detroit. On the 22nd, Colonel Proctor\r\nadvancing from Detroit with four guns and 950 men, half of whom\r\nwere Indians, attacked General Winchester in front of Frenchtown,\r\nand gained a complete victory. Winchester with 538 men were taken\r\nprisoners. In consequence of the greatly superior numbers of the\r\nU.S. troops in the neighbourhood, Proctor then withdrew to Detroit\r\nand Sandwich. Little further occurred till 23rd April, when Proctor\r\nled a small expedition against a U.S. work on the Miami river called\r\nFort Meigs. The attempt was unsuccessful, and Proctor returned\r\nto Sandwich about 12th May. The only noteworthy incident was the\r\nsevere punishment inflicted on the U.S. force in a sortie on the\r\n5th May, in which nearly 500 were taken prisoners. The British loss\r\nwas comparatively small. On the 2nd August, Proctor made a similar\r\nattempt on a fort newly constructed at the mouth of the Sandusky\r\nriver. After an attempt to storm, which was repulsed with the\r\nloss of 100 killed and wounded, he retired. After this no further\r\nmovement on either side occurred till September, when a change in\r\nthe situation was wrought by a success gained by the U.S. navy on\r\nthe lake. On 10th September, a naval action was fought on Lake Erie,\r\nbetween six British and nine U.S. ships, in which the latter were\r\ncompletely victorious. This rendered Proctor’s position extremely\r\ncritical. He at once evacuated Detroit and Amherstberg, and, with a\r\nforce of less than 1000 men, not counting Indians, retreated along\r\nthe river Thames, closely followed by Harrison. On the 5th October,\r\nhe decided to make a stand. Attacked by a greatly superior force, he\r\nwas at once overwhelmed by charges of cavalry, of which Harrison had\r\n1200 in the field, and the greater part of his men made prisoners.\r\nProctor, with some 200 men only, made good his retreat to Ancaster,\r\neighty-five miles distant. The celebrated Indian Chief, Tecumseh, was\r\nslain on this occasion, and the state of Michigan passed again into\r\nUnited States’ keeping. Harrison, after destroying Moravian town, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of which the action had been fought, returned to\r\nDetroit and Amherstberg, and, shortly afterwards, embarked with a\r\nportion of his force for the Niagara frontier.\r\n\r\nActive operations at the eastern end of Lake Ontario commenced in\r\nApril. Early in that month, a United States’ force of about 6000 men\r\nwas collected at Sackett’s Harbour, which was the United States’\r\nchief naval depot on the lake. On 27th, the U.S. lake squadron with\r\n2000 troops on board appeared off Toronto,[59] and at once began to\r\nland under the guns of the fleet. Major General Sheaffe, who had 500\r\nregular troops and militia and some Indians, after ineffectually\r\nopposing the landing, was forced to withdraw towards Kingston, and\r\nthe town was occupied by the enemy. General Pike, commanding the\r\nU.S. troops, was killed, and both sides suffered considerable loss\r\nby the explosion of a magazine. On the 8th May, after burning the\r\npublic buildings, the U.S. force withdrew, and were conveyed to the\r\nmouth of the Niagara river, where they landed, with a view to joining\r\nin operations against Forts George and Erie. The vessels were then\r\nemployed in bringing further re-inforcements from Sackett’s Harbour,\r\nfor the contemplated attack on Fort George.\r\n\r\nThe British force on the Niagara frontier consisted at this time\r\nof 1800 regular troops, 500 militia, and 40 Indians, under Major\r\nGeneral Vincent. On 27th May, the U.S. force, numbering 6000 to 7000\r\nmen, under General Dearborn, crossed under cover of the guns of the\r\nflotilla and of Fort Niagara. After a stubborn contest, in which\r\nthey suffered a loss of 445 killed and wounded, the British troops\r\nevacuated Fort George, and retired to Burlington Heights at the head\r\nof Lake Ontario. Fort Erie was also evacuated. Four days later,\r\nDearborn detached 3500 men under Generals Chandler and Winder to\r\nfollow Vincent, and, on 5th June, the U.S. force encamped at Stoney\r\nCreek, seven miles from Vincent’s position. In this critical position\r\nVincent resolved on a night attack. At 2 o’clock in the morning, 700\r\nmen of the 8th and 49th regiments, led by Colonel Harvey, penetrated\r\nthe U.S. camp. Four guns were captured; the greatest confusion was\r\ncaused in the surprised camp, from which the enemy were driven. In\r\norder to conceal the smallness of his force, Harvey withdrew before\r\ndaylight, taking with him two guns and 123 prisoners, among whom were\r\nthe two United States Generals. In this spirited affair the British\r\nloss amounted to 23 killed, 136 wounded and 55 missing. The U.S.\r\nforce, after burning its tents and stores, fell back precipitately to\r\nForty-mile Creek, 11 miles in rear of the field. Two days later, a\r\nsmall British squadron from Kingston, under Sir James Yeo, bringing\r\nsome reinforcements for Vincent, appeared and drove the U.S. force\r\nfrom their camp which was taken possession of. Harvey’s gallant\r\nexploit had saved the frontier. On the 24th June, in retaliation for\r\nthe affair at Stoney Creek, a U.S. force under Colonel Boerstler\r\nattempted to surprise an outpost of Canadian rangers at Beaver Dam,\r\nunder Lieutenant Fitzgibbon. Through the loyalty of the wife of a\r\nCanadian farmer, Fitzgibbon received timely warning. Disposing of\r\nhis little force of 200 men, mostly Indians, to the best advantage,\r\nthe advancing enemy were caught in an ambush, and, after suffering\r\nsome loss, Boerstler capitulated with 25 officers, 519 men, two guns\r\nand a stand of colours. Fifty-six of the U.S. force were killed and\r\nwounded, Boerstler himself being among the latter. At the moment of\r\ncapitulation, a reinforcement of 200 men under Major du Haren joined\r\nFitzgibbon, and enabled him to guard his prisoners. These successive\r\nreverses dispirited the U.S. troops in this part of the frontier to\r\nsuch an extent, that they suffered themselves to be blockaded in Fort\r\nGeorge by very inferior numbers. On the 4th and 11th of July, Forts\r\nSchlosser and Black Rock were captured by separate _coups de main_,\r\nand the military stores destroyed or carried off. In the second\r\naffair Lieutenant Colonel Bisshopp, an officer of great promise, was\r\nunfortunately killed. On the 31st July, the United States’ squadron\r\non Ontario paid a second visit to Toronto, which was undefended, and\r\nburned some more buildings. This unexpected move on the part of the\r\nenemy occurred just as the first troop of the 19th dispatched from\r\nLower Canada was near Toronto, and the ammunition and baggage were\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Major General de Rottenburg had taken over command on the\r\nNiagara frontier, from Vincent, and, on 20th July, the first troop of\r\nthe 19th from Lower Canada joined the army at Four Mile Creek. Two\r\ndays later we find the General reporting “two of our cavalry vedettes\r\nwere taken yesterday by the enemy.” On the 17th August, Lieutenant\r\nGladwin of the 19th was wounded in a skirmish near Fort George. About\r\nthe 20th August, Sir George Prevost joined de Rottenburg, bringing\r\nwith him some reinforcements, among which was the second troop of\r\nthe 19th Light Dragoons, completing the squadron under Captain\r\nLisle. On the 24th, a demonstration was made against Fort George.\r\nThe advance was led by thirty of the 19th, under their Lieutenant\r\nColonel the Hon. J. O’Neill. Beyond driving the enemy, for a short\r\ntime, out of the town of Newark, and capturing 60 or 70 prisoners\r\nthe demonstration was without result. The British force suffered the\r\nloss of an officer and ten men, who advanced too far, and were taken\r\nprisoners. On the 11th September an engagement took place between the\r\ntwo Ontario squadrons, the day after the engagement on Lake Erie,\r\nalready mentioned. In this also the U.S. squadron had the best of it,\r\nbut there were no decisive results. In both engagements the British\r\nsquadrons were at a disadvantage through want of regular sailors: the\r\ngreater part of their crews consisting of Canadians and soldiers.\r\nEarly in September, Sir George Prevost returned to Kingston, leaving\r\nGeneral de Rottenburg in command. On the 1st October, part of the\r\nU.S. force embarked at Niagara, and were conveyed to Sackett’s\r\nHarbour to join in operations against Kingston and Montreal, leaving\r\nGeneral McClure in command at Fort George and Niagara. The following\r\nday, the 49th and 104th Regiments, under de Rottenburg, started for\r\nKingston, which they reached on the 16th, leaving Vincent in command\r\non the Niagara frontier. Their presence secured Kingston from attack,\r\nand helped to furnish the force that triumphed at Chrystler’s Farm.\r\nTwo companies of de Watteville’s regiment, proceeding from Toronto to\r\nKingston, were less fortunate, being captured by the U.S. squadron.\r\nOn the 9th October, the news of Proctor’s defeat on the Thames\r\nreached Vincent, causing him to withdraw from the neighbourhood\r\nof Fort George, and fall back to Burlington Heights; where he was\r\njoined by the remains of Proctor’s force. The difficulty in obtaining\r\nsupplies, always great, were apparently almost insurmountable at this\r\ntime; for we find Vincent recommending that Major Lisle’s squadron\r\nshould return to Kingston and Montreal. The discouragement in the\r\nBritish force was very great. Sir George Prevost, believing that\r\nUpper Canada was lost, sent orders to Vincent to collect his troops,\r\nand bring them to Kingston; but the order was not obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. troops in Fort George under McClure, at this time indulged\r\nin a series of cruel and wanton excesses against the Canadian\r\ninhabitants in the neighbourhood. In order to put some check on\r\nthese excesses Vincent detached a small force of about 500 men under\r\nColonel Murray in the direction of Fort George. With them went a\r\ntroop of the 19th. As Murray advanced, McClure’s outposts fell back.\r\nOn Murray making a sudden dash forwards, McClure precipitately\r\nabandoned Fort George, on 12th December, and retreated across\r\nthe Niagara river, after burning the little town of Newark: an\r\ninhuman act at such an inclement season of the year, and the more\r\ninexcusable, in that he left in the Fort, without destroying them,\r\nhis tents standing, a great quantity of stores, and some guns. “With\r\nthe same intention, Queenston was deliberately bombarded with red-hot\r\nshot from the batteries at Lewiston. Many isolated farm houses were\r\ndestroyed by marauding parties of soldiers, or, when they proved too\r\nsubstantial for instant demolition, were rendered uninhabitable by\r\nremoval of the doors and windows. The few cattle still remaining in\r\nthe possession of the country people were mercilessly slaughtered or\r\ndriven away, and their grain and flour removed or destroyed.”[60]\r\nAt this juncture, Lieutenant General Drummond,[61] who had been\r\nappointed to the command of Upper Canada, arrived and took command\r\nof the troops. Following up the success at Fort George, Drummond\r\nresolved on attacking Niagara. On the night of the 18th December,\r\na force of 550 men of the 41st and 100th, under Colonel Murray,\r\nwas silently ferried across the river, three miles above the Fort.\r\nAdvancing silently in two columns, with unloaded muskets and\r\nbayonets fixed, the enemy’s picquets were seized before any alarm\r\ncould be given: one party escaladed one of the bastions, while the\r\nother entered by the gate that had been left open for the relief\r\nof sentries. The garrison made but a feeble resistance, and, in\r\na few minutes the British force was in complete possession of the\r\nFort, with 27 guns, over 3000 stand of arms and 344 prisoners. The\r\ndrummers of the 100th found their way to the roof of the principal\r\nbuilding, and played “The British Grenadiers” as a signal of success\r\nto their comrades across the river. This brilliant success was gained\r\nwith a loss of only six men killed and five wounded. A few hours\r\nlater, a second force was ferried across, and seized Lewiston after\r\na slight skirmish, capturing two guns and other military stores. In\r\nretaliation for the burning of Newark, Lewiston and four neighbouring\r\nvillages were laid in ruins.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. force, about 2500 strong, was now commanded by General Hall,\r\nand quartered at Black Rock and Buffalo. Intent on following up his\r\nsuccess, Drummond placed his head quarters near Fort Erie. On the\r\nnight of the 29th, Major General Riall, with 600 men and about 100\r\nIndians, crossed the Niagara river about two miles below Black Rock,\r\ndrove in a U.S. picquet, and took up a position at a bridge over a\r\nsmall stream. At daylight on the 31st, the Royal Scots, about 800\r\nstrong, with a detachment of Major Lisle’s squadron of the 19th Light\r\nDragoons, the whole under command of Lt. Colonel Gordon, crossed\r\nover, under fire, to land above Black Rock. Joining hands with Riall,\r\nBlack Rock was attacked and occupied after a short resistance, the\r\ndefending force retreating to Buffalo. The advance was continued, and\r\nBuffalo taken after a poor resistance: 130 prisoners and 8 guns were\r\ncaptured, and four armed vessels of the U.S. squadron on Lake Erie,\r\nburned. Black Rock and Buffalo were burned to the ground. The work\r\nwas completed by Major Lisle’s squadron, which swept the frontier\r\nfrom Buffalo to Lewiston, bringing the operations to an end on the\r\n2nd January 1814. The British troops were then withdrawn to the\r\nCanadian side, with the exception of a garrison left in Fort Niagara.\r\nThus closed operations at this part of the frontier for the year.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the year on the eastern frontier have now to be\r\nrecorded. Taking advantage of the frozen state of the St Lawrence,\r\nskirmishing parties of U.S. troops, from Ogdensburg, crossed the\r\nriver in January and February, and committed depredations on the\r\nCanadian side. In order to put an end to these attacks, Major\r\nMacdonell, with 480 men and three field pieces, crossed the ice\r\non the morning of the 22nd February, drove the enemy from their\r\nposition, capturing 11 guns and over 70 prisoners. After burning\r\ntwo armed schooners and two gunboats, as well as the barracks,\r\nMacdonell returned to the Canadian shore. This brilliant little\r\naffair was accomplished with the loss of eight killed and fifty-two\r\nwounded. On the 27th May, an expedition, under Sir George Prevost,\r\nsailed from Kingston to capture Sackett’s Harbour. Owing to the\r\nincapacity and irresolution of Sir George Prevost, the affair ended\r\nin failure. After unnecessary delay, which enabled the enemy to\r\nmake preparations for defence, the troops landed, on 29th, and\r\ndrove the enemy from their positions. In anticipation of having to\r\ncapitulate, their navy-yard and ships were set on fire by the enemy,\r\nand a great quantity of naval stores and provisions, captured at\r\nYork, destroyed; when Sir George Prevost, against the advice of his\r\nofficers, gave the order to retreat, at the moment that success was\r\nin his grasp. The troops re-embarked and returned to Kingston, with\r\nabout 100 prisoners, having suffered a loss of 50 killed and 211\r\nwounded. The capture of Sackett’s Harbour by the British would have\r\nhad a tremendous influence on the war. It was the principal United\r\nStates’ base on the lake, and its capture would have given Canada\r\nthe complete supremacy of Lake Ontario as long as the war lasted,\r\nbesides the possession of the great quantities of naval and military\r\nstores that had been collected there by the United States’ Government.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd June, an attack was made by four armed vessels of the U.S.\r\nsquadron on Lake Champlain, upon the post of Isle aux Noix, about 40\r\nmiles from Montreal; resulting in the capture of two U.S. sloops.\r\nOn 29th July, a flotilla, composed of the two captured vessels and\r\nthree gunboats, transported over land from the St Lawrence, embarked\r\nabout 1000 men of the 13th and 100th regiments under Lieutenant\r\nColonel Murray, and arrived, the next day, before Plattsburg. The\r\nU.S. militia in charge of the place, retired without making any\r\nresistance. The barracks and blockhouses were burned, and a quantity\r\nof naval stores carried off. Four thousand U.S. troops under\r\nGeneral Hampton, destined to act against Montreal, lay inactive at\r\nBurlington, without interfering with Murray.\r\n\r\nNothing further of importance happened till October, when the U.S.\r\npreparations for the attack on Montreal were complete. For this\r\npurpose, a corps of 8800 men, under General Wilkinson, was assembled\r\nat Grenadier Island, at the eastern end of Ontario, fully provided\r\nwith boats. At the same time a second corps of about 5700 men, under\r\nGeneral Hampton, was assembled on Lake Champlain. The two corps were\r\nintended to join hands at St Regis, and act in combination. The first\r\nmovement was made by Hampton. Advancing from Plattsburg, he reached\r\nFour Corners on the Chateaugay river, about 8th October. To oppose\r\nhim, Sir G. Prevost detached a body of Canadian militia, about 1000\r\nstrong, under Lt. Colonel de Salaberry, who, after some skirmishing\r\nto ascertain the direction of Hampton’s advance, took up a position\r\non the west bank of the Chateaugay river.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st, Hampton crossed the frontier, and advanced, cutting\r\nroads for his guns, and repairing bridges as he moved forward.\r\nDuring the night of the 25th, Hampton detached a brigade under\r\nColonel Purdy to ford the Chateaugay river, march down the right\r\nbank, and take the Canadian position in rear, while he himself\r\nassailed it in front. De Salaberry’s position, a naturally strong\r\none in a dense forest, intersected by ravines, had been further\r\nstrengthened by breaking down bridges in the front, and making\r\ntimber breastworks. Hampton commenced his attack at 10 o’clock on\r\nthe morning of the 26th, but it was not pushed home. By keeping his\r\nmen under cover, and placing buglers in the woods, de Salaberry gave\r\nthe impression to the enemy of having a much greater number of men\r\nthan had been supposed. Meanwhile, Purdy’s brigade, which had lost\r\nits way in the woods, came up, attracted by the firing, and overthrew\r\na company of Canadians on the right bank. Re-inforcements coming up\r\nunder Macdonell, the officer who distinguished himself at Ogdensburg\r\nin February, Purdy was driven into the woods with loss and confusion,\r\nand took no further part in the battle. So disorganised were his\r\ntroops that, during the following night, they opened fire on each\r\nother, causing themselves further losses. Seeing the failure of the\r\nflank attack on which he had principally depended, and believing the\r\nCanadian force in his front to be stronger than it was, Hampton drew\r\noff and fell back, first on Four Corners, and, a few days later, to\r\nPlattsburgh; whence his force shortly afterwards went into winter\r\nquarters. This brilliant affair was fought entirely by the Canadian\r\nmilitia at a cost of 5 killed, 16 wounded, and four missing. A month\r\nafter the action, an officer and twenty-five men of the 19th Light\r\nDragoons were dispatched to join de Salaberry at Chateaugay.\r\n\r\nIt was not till 5th November that Wilkinson’s corps left Grenadier\r\nIsland, in a flotilla of between two and three hundred open boats,\r\nprotected by gunboats, and entered the St Lawrence. According to\r\nthe original plan, the capture of Kingston had been intended; but\r\nthis was relinquished on the arrival there of the re-inforcements\r\nsent under de Rottenburg. On arriving near Ogdensburg, the force was\r\nlanded on the south bank of the river, and marched down to a point\r\n14 miles below that place, in order to avoid the risk of passing\r\nthe small Canadian post of Fort Wellington at Prescott. The boats\r\nwere brought down at night with muffled oars. On the 9th, the force\r\nwas again landed, this time on the left bank, in order to pass the\r\nrapid known as the Long Sault. The following day, one division, under\r\nGeneral Brown, marched to occupy Cornwall; the other division, under\r\nGeneral Boyd, was retained at the head of the rapid, to oppose a\r\nBritish force that was hanging on their rear.\r\n\r\nDirectly the start of the U.S. expedition down the St Lawrence was\r\nknown in Kingston, as many men as could be safely spared, had been\r\ndetached under Lieutenant Colonel Morrison of the 89th, convoyed by\r\na few gunboats, to follow on Wilkinson’s rear. At Fort Wellington,\r\nMorrison received a further accession of force, which brought up\r\nhis numbers to 800 rank and file. On the 9th, he landed, thirteen\r\nmiles lower down, and, in a few hours, was in touch with Wilkinson’s\r\nforce. During the following day some skirmishing took place, and then\r\nMorrison, finding that Boyd was preparing to attack him in force,\r\ntook up a position at a place named “Chrystler’s Farm.” Morrison’s\r\nforce was made up of some companies of the 49th, 89th, some militia,\r\nthree 6 Pr. guns and thirty Indians. Boyd had 2500 men, among which\r\nwas a strong force of cavalry, and ten guns. Unlike all previous\r\nactions in this war, the battle of Chrystler’s Farm was fought in\r\nopen country. This conferred an advantage on the better trained and\r\ndisciplined British troops, that atoned for their inferiority in\r\nnumbers. The action commenced about 2 o’clock in the afternoon of\r\nthe 11th, and, after three hours’ fighting, in the course of which\r\na charge of United States’ dragoons was defeated by three companies\r\nof the 89th, Boyd fell back, repulsed at every point, with the loss\r\nof one gun, 339 killed and wounded, among the former of whom was the\r\nU.S. General Covington, and over 100 prisoners. The British loss was\r\n21 killed, 148 wounded and 12 missing. Boyd fell back on his boats,\r\nand embarked after the action, crossing over to the right bank of\r\nthe river. The following day, he descended the rapid, and joined\r\nBrown’s force near Cornwall. The cavalry, and some of the artillery,\r\nmarched along the Canadian bank, without embarking. Morrison, with\r\nhis small force, continued his march down the left bank. On his force\r\nbeing re-united, Wilkinson learned that he could expect no aid from\r\nHampton. He at once decided on giving up the attempt on Montreal, and\r\nretreating by the only way open to him. Embarking his whole force,\r\non the 13th, he descended the St Lawrence to the mouth of the Salmon\r\nriver, and ascended that river seven miles to French Mills. Here he\r\nlay, expecting to be attacked, till 12th February, when he set fire\r\nto his boats, huts, and blockhouses, and retreated to Plattsburgh and\r\nBurlington on Lake Champlain.\r\n\r\nThus, in loss and disaster, ended the second and most serious attempt\r\nagainst Montreal, made during the war. A handful of Canadians at\r\nChateaugay, in the woods that gave their special fighting powers\r\na signal opportunity, and a small number of British troops at\r\nChrystler’s Farm, where the field of action gave full scope to their\r\ntraining and discipline, had saved Canada.\r\n\r\nOf the three invasions of the Canadian frontier, the one by Detroit\r\nwas alone successful. Proctor’s defeat on the Thames was irreparable.\r\nFortunately for Canada, it was the point at which the enemy’s success\r\nwas least important. Vincent’s spirited affair at Stoney Creek was\r\nthe turning-point of the year’s campaign. Had he been overwhelmed,\r\nthe Niagara frontier would have been lost, and the re-inforcements\r\nthat saved Kingston from attack could not have been spared. The fall\r\nof Kingston might have led to the fall of Montreal.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the year showed the extreme importance to Canada\r\nof the mastery on Ontario, and the retention of Kingston. The whole\r\ncountry was an almost trackless forest. The only way of moving troops\r\nand stores was by water. Full subsistence for the troops in Upper\r\nCanada could not be procured among the scanty population, and they\r\nwere largely dependent for rations on pork and biscuit from England.\r\nSo long as the waterway was open, the defence of the Niagara frontier\r\nwas possible. As the supremacy of the U.S. navy on Lake Erie made\r\nit impossible for the British to continue the war on the Detroit\r\nfrontier, so a decisive defeat on Lake Ontario would have lost the\r\nNiagara frontier also. But, till the end of the war, the U.S. navy\r\nnever succeeded in establishing more than a temporary supremacy on\r\nOntario.\r\n\r\nThe failure of Wilkinson’s expedition showed the risk of attacking\r\nMontreal, while Kingston was strongly held by a hostile force. An\r\nexpedition, once launched on the St Lawrence, could not re-ascend\r\nagainst the current, and was liable to be caught between two fires,\r\nas actually happened in Wilkinson’s case. The true objective of the\r\nUnited States, throughout the war, was Kingston; the possession of\r\nwhich would have made them masters of Upper Canada without a further\r\neffort, and would have placed Montreal in jeopardy. But Kingston was\r\nnever seriously attacked during the whole war.\r\n\r\nOn the Canadian side, the importance of gaining possession of\r\nSackett’s Harbour was not clearly recognized. The capture and\r\nretention of that place would have practically secured the Niagara\r\nfrontier, and assured the safety of Montreal. But Sir George\r\nPrevost’s half-hearted and abortive attack in May, was the only\r\nattempt made during the war. To both sides, the capture of their\r\nenemy’s depôt on the lake was of supreme importance. The keys of\r\nsuccessful attack and defence were at Sackett’s Harbour and Kingston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE NIAGARA FRONTIER\r\n\r\n1814-1821\r\n\r\n  United States’ plans--Attempt on Mackinaw--La Colle--State\r\n  of affairs on Niagara frontier--Drummond’s raid on\r\n  Oswego--Dover--Advance of U.S. force--Capture of Fort\r\n  Erie--Battle of Chippewa--Critical position of British\r\n  force--Battle of Lundy’s Lane--Retreat of U.S. forces--Fort Erie\r\n  invested--Assault on Fort Erie--Sergeant Powell--Conclusion of\r\n  operations on Niagara frontier--Prevost’s abortive attack on\r\n  Plattsburgh--Defeat of British squadron on Lake Champlain--Other\r\n  operations--Bladensberg--Capture of Washington--General Ross\r\n  killed--Victory at Baltimore--Expedition against New Orleans--Its\r\n  defeat--Fort Bowyer captured--Treaty of Ghent--Sir William\r\n  Payne--Sir John Vandeleur--Badge “Niagara” granted--Regiment\r\n  returns to England--Equipped as Lancers--Embark for\r\n  Ireland--Disbanded.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plans of the United States’ government for the campaign of 1814\r\nvaried considerably from those of the preceding years. They realised\r\nthe mistake they had made in advancing on Montreal without first\r\ngetting possession of Kingston, and they recognized the delusion on\r\nwhich they had acted, in believing that the Canadians would welcome\r\ntheir troops wherever they appeared on Canadian soil. It was, indeed,\r\nthe unflinching loyalty of the Canadians to the British flag that\r\nhad so far preserved Canada, as the troops England had been able to\r\nspare, would, by themselves, have been inadequate for the purpose.\r\nThe United States’ plans for 1814 were therefore directed to the\r\nfollowing objects. To retake the island of Mackinaw; to renew the\r\ninvasion of the Niagara frontier; and, after getting possession of\r\nForts George and Niagara, to proceed against Kingston. The United\r\nStates’ officers on the Niagara frontier, had also learned that\r\nenthusiasm without discipline was of little value, when opposed\r\nin the open field to a disciplined enemy; the winter and spring\r\ntherefore were utilised by them in enforcing a higher degree of drill\r\nand discipline than had hitherto been aimed at. This resulted in a\r\nmarked improvement in the fighting qualities of their troops during\r\nthe remainder of the war.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of April, a reinforcement of 100 men, conveying a\r\nquantity of much-needed supplies and stores, under Colonel McDouall,\r\nwas sent from Toronto to Mackinaw, which was reached after a most\r\ndifficult journey on 18th May. A great number of Indians then\r\nflocked into the post, which prompted McDouall to fit out a small\r\nexpedition of 150 men with 500 Indians against a small post that had\r\nbeen lately established at Prairie du Chien on the Mississippi, 200\r\nmiles north-west of the present town of Chicago. Moving by water, the\r\nexpedition, under Colonel M‘Kay, was completely successful, and the\r\npost was captured with two guns, and 61 prisoners, on 19th July, at\r\na cost of only three Indians wounded.\r\n\r\nOn 26th July, a U.S. expedition from Detroit, consisting of five\r\narmed vessels and about 750 troops, arrived off Mackinaw, and landed\r\non 4th August, when they were completely repulsed in an attack on\r\nMcDouall’s position, regaining their ships with loss and confusion.\r\nNo further attempt was made, but part of the expedition uselessly\r\nremained in the vicinity for some time, losing two armed vessels,\r\nwhich were taken, on 3rd and 6th September, by a small party of\r\nseamen and militia under Lieutenants Bulger and Worseley. No further\r\nfighting took place in this quarter, and Mackinaw remained in the\r\nhands of the British till the end of the war.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th March, General Wilkinson at the head of 4000 U.S. troops\r\nadvanced from Plattsburgh, crossed Lake Champlain on the ice, and\r\nattacked a small British force, in a stone mill at La Colle, under\r\nMajor Handcock. Wilkinson was repulsed with some loss, and returned\r\nto Plattsburgh.\r\n\r\nThe position of the British troops on the Niagara frontier early in\r\nthe year was very discouraging. The hardships they had undergone\r\nduring the operations in December had caused great sickness, so that\r\nthe abandonment of Fort Niagara was at one time seriously entertained.\r\n\r\n  “The region between Chippewa and Erie had been so completely\r\n  laid waste that it remained almost uninhabited. In addition\r\n  to his troops, Drummond had several thousand non-combatants\r\n  to feed, and, in the destitute condition of the country, this\r\n  seemed an almost hopeless task. Most of the western Indians that\r\n  had survived General Proctor’s defeat, as well as the whole\r\n  Six Nations from the Grand River, three thousand persons in\r\n  all, of whom two-thirds were helpless women and children, had\r\n  sought refuge near the British cantonments at Burlington. Their\r\n  depredations so harassed and alarmed many of the inhabitants in\r\n  the vicinity, that they abandoned their farms, and took shelter\r\n  in the soldiers’ quarters. The homeless fugitives from the\r\n  Niagara were also dependent upon the over-taxed commissariat.\r\n  Thus, while his armed force numbered less than two thousand,\r\n  between seven and eight thousand rations were issued daily....\r\n  The Indians daily consumed twice as much flour as the whole\r\n  of the troops. In the garrison of Fort Erie alone, not much\r\n  exceeding one hundred persons, no less than sixty-nine cases of\r\n  ague were reported in a single week.”[62]\r\n\r\nA great number of Indians on the United States’ side were forced\r\nto take up arms. Marauding parties from Detroit made frequent\r\nincursions, carrying off loyal inhabitants, and destroying Delaware\r\nand Point aux Pins. By the end of January, Black Rock was re-occupied\r\nby United States’ troops, whence they annoyed Fort Erie by artillery\r\nfire. It was in the midst of these difficulties that Drummond was\r\nobliged to send the re-inforcements under McDouall to Mackinaw, as\r\nalready mentioned, and to further weaken his available forces by\r\nwithdrawing a regiment from Toronto to strengthen Kingston.\r\n\r\nBy great exertions and the employment of soldiers in the shipyards,\r\nthe British naval forces on Ontario had established a superiority.\r\nDrummond wished to attack Sackett’s Harbour, and destroy the enemy’s\r\nvessels there; but Sir George Prevost refused to provide the\r\nnecessary troops. On the 5th May, Drummond made a successful dash\r\nfrom Kingston, with a force of about 1000 troops, upon Oswego. They\r\nlanded on the 6th, captured the fort, destroyed all military stores\r\nthat could not be carried off, and re-embarked. This successful\r\nattack delayed the United States’ operations on the Niagara frontier\r\nfor several weeks, and enabled a strict blockade of Sackett’s Harbour\r\nto be established.\r\n\r\nEarly in March, Major Lisle, with a troop of the 19th Light Dragoons\r\nand a few militia, was placed in the little village of Dover, near\r\nLong Point on Lake Erie, to watch any attempt of the enemy from that\r\nside against Burlington. On the 15th May, eight hundred U.S. infantry\r\ncrossed the lake in armed vessels, and landed. Major Lisle withdrew\r\nhis men, and Dover was burned to the ground; after which the invading\r\nforce re-embarked.\r\n\r\nBy the end of June, the United States’ troops on the Niagara frontier\r\nhad gathered in great numbers, and it was evident that an invasion\r\nwas imminent. Drummond had vainly urged on Sir George Prevost\r\nthe necessity of reinforcing the troops on the frontier; but Sir\r\nGeorge was convinced that the principal attack would come from Lake\r\nChamplain, and withheld the much-needed troops. From Toronto to\r\nLong Point on Lake Erie, Drummond’s force did not much exceed 4000\r\nmen. A number of important points had to be guarded, and the force\r\nunder General Riall on the actual frontier was only about 2200 men,\r\nincluding Indians, distributed on a length of thirty-six miles, and\r\nincluding the garrison in Niagara. Only about seven hundred men were\r\navailable for field operations. At the end of June, the strength of\r\nMajor Lisle’s squadron was six officers, eleven sergeants, and one\r\nhundred and eighteen rank and file, in five different detachments, at\r\nFort George, Queenston, Chippewa, Fort Erie, and Long Point.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 3rd July, the United States’ force, 4000\r\nstrong, under General Brown, was ferried across in two divisions\r\nabove and below Fort Erie, under cover of a fog. A picquet of the\r\n19th Light Dragoons narrowly escaped being cut off, and the fort\r\nwas at once invested. It was occupied at that time by a garrison of\r\n170 men, and, though in no condition to make a proper defence, it\r\nwas expected to maintain itself for a short time. It was however\r\nsurrendered after the exchange of a few cannon shots. Riall, with\r\nhis inferior numbers, contented himself by maintaining a small corps\r\nof observation in his front, while he himself remained encamped on\r\nthe left bank of the Chippewa. On the 4th, Brown advanced, driving\r\nbefore him the corps of observation which destroyed the bridges as it\r\nfell back. A detachment of the 19th Light Dragoons under Lieutenant\r\nHorton, covering the rear, became involved in a skirmish in which\r\nthey drove a party of the enemy into a house, which would probably\r\nhave been captured had not assistance come to them. Four men and\r\neight horses of the 19th were wounded in the skirmish. Brown encamped\r\nthat night within sight of Riall’s position.\r\n\r\nRiall was reinforced on the 5th by the arrival of the 8th regiment\r\nfrom Toronto, and, greatly under-estimating Brown’s force, which now\r\namounted to about 5000 men with nine guns, he resolved on leaving\r\nhis field works, and attacking. At three in the afternoon, Riall,\r\nwhose force now amounted to about 1900 men, threw forward a body\r\nof militia and Indians on his right flank. After some desultory\r\nskirmishing they were driven back by increasing numbers, and fell\r\nback on the three light infantry companies, who received their\r\nassailants under U.S. General Porter with a terrific volley, driving\r\nthem back in complete disorder, till they themselves were in turn\r\nforced to fall back by superior numbers. Riall, meanwhile, had passed\r\nthe Chippewa, and drawn up his whole force in order of battle with\r\nthree guns. After some cannonading, he formed six companies of the\r\nRoyal Scots, and five companies of the 100th in two columns, and led\r\nthem against the enemy’s centre. They were received with a tremendous\r\nfire against which they were unable to advance: almost every field\r\nofficer, excepting Riall himself, was struck down, and the columns,\r\nsuffering heavy losses, were obliged to withdraw, leaving their dead\r\nand many of their wounded on the field. The 8th regiment covered the\r\nretreat, which was not pressed, and the force recrossed the Chippewa\r\nto its former position. “The guns were removed only by the gallant\r\nexertions of some troopers of the 19th Dragoons, who attached their\r\nown horses to the carriages, and rode off with them in the teeth of\r\nthe enemy.”[63] The British loss amounted to 515 killed, wounded, and\r\nmissing, which fell principally on the Royal Scots and 100th, who\r\nlost 422 officers and men out of a total of 950 engaged. The 19th\r\nLight Dragoons had one sergeant and five men wounded. General Riall,\r\nin his dispatch after the battle, says:--\r\n\r\n  “I am particularly obliged to Major Lisle of the 19th Light\r\n  Dragoons for the manner in which he covered and protected one\r\n  of the 24-pounders which had been disabled. Lieutenant Colonel\r\n  Pearson has reported to me, in the most favourable terms, the\r\n  excellent manner in which Lieutenant Horton, with a party of the\r\n  19th Light Dragoons observed the motions of the enemy, while he\r\n  occupied the position he took on his first landing (on 3rd July),\r\n  and during his advance to this place.”\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this repulse, nearly the whole of his Indians\r\nand many of the militia left Riall, in order to look after their\r\nfamilies. On the 8th, Brown threw a bridge across the Chippewa, three\r\nmiles up the stream, thus turning Riall’s right. Riall thereupon\r\nbroke up his camp, and withdrew to Fort George. Brown continued\r\nhis advance, occupied Queenston Heights, and took up a position,\r\ninvesting Fort George, with his right resting on the Niagara river,\r\nand his left on the lake. Riall, after strengthening the garrisons\r\nin the forts, withdrew in the direction of Burlington Heights. To\r\ndo this, he executed a remarkable night march, to avoid the enemy\r\nby whom he was hemmed in. At midnight, his force entered the lake,\r\nwhich is very shallow for a hundred yards from the shore, and, wading\r\nthrough the water for two miles and a half, he marched round the\r\nleft wing of the investing army, without being detected by their\r\nvedettes. For ten days Brown lay inactive, looking for the arrival of\r\nthe U.S. Ontario squadron to enable him to strike a decisive blow.\r\nBut the squadron had been blockaded in Sackett’s Harbour ever since\r\nthe capture of Oswego, and was unable to render him any assistance.\r\nFrequent skirmishes took place, in which the United States’ troops\r\nsuffered losses, often at the hands of the Canadians who were roused\r\nto fury by the outrages committed on them. On one occasion the U.S.\r\nGeneral Swift was killed by a patrol of the 8th regiment; a wagon\r\ntrain was destroyed, and the picquet guard at Erie cut off to a man.\r\nIn retaliation for these losses, the United States’ troops burned the\r\nvillage of St David’s, and destroyed every dwelling-house between\r\nQueenston and Niagara Falls; under circumstances of such barbarity\r\nthat the Colonel in command was dismissed from the army.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Riall received some reinforcements from Toronto, and\r\na great number of militia again joined him, badly armed and\r\nundisciplined, but exasperated beyond measure at the brigand-like\r\nacts of the invaders. This enabled him to advance, and threatened\r\nBrown’s communications. On the 20th, Brown advanced to Fort George,\r\nand commenced preparations for a siege, in the hopes that Riall would\r\nagain hazard an engagement with inferior forces to relieve the Fort.\r\nTwo days later, Riall with 1700 regular troops, 700 militia, and\r\nsome Indians, took post in front of Twelve Mile Creek, in readiness\r\nto fall upon Brown if he should commence active operations against\r\nFort George. On the 23rd, Brown received intelligence that the U.S.\r\nsquadron was closely blockaded in Sackett’s Harbour, and was in no\r\nposition to render him assistance. He at once broke up his camp,\r\nand withdrew to the right bank of the Chippewa, with the intention\r\nof depositing all unnecessary baggage and stores at Erie, and then\r\nmaking a rapid advance on Burlington and Toronto. On the same day,\r\nGeneral Drummond reached Toronto, from Kingston, with the 89th\r\nregiment. These were at once sent forward, under Lieutenant Colonel\r\nTucker, to Fort Niagara, with instructions to take drafts from the\r\ngarrisons of the different forts, and to march, on the 25th, to\r\nLewiston, where Brown had established a base of supplies. Riall was,\r\nat the same time, ordered to advance towards the Chippewa. Drummond\r\nhimself embarked for Niagara, on the afternoon of the 24th, leaving\r\nToronto with only a few invalids as a garrison.\r\n\r\nAt midnight of the 24th, Riall detached about 900 men under\r\nLieutenant Colonel Pearson, with whom was a troop of the 19th Light\r\nDragoons under Major Lisle, to advance and occupy the high ground\r\nnear the Niagara Falls. By seven o’clock the next morning, after\r\na fourteen-mile march, Pearson occupied a hill by Lundy’s Lane,\r\nwithin three miles of the United States’ camp, and one mile from\r\nthe Niagara Falls. At the same time, Drummond landed and commenced\r\nhis march along the left bank of the Niagara river, while Tucker,\r\nin accordance with previous orders, marched along the right bank on\r\nLewiston. Lewiston was captured at noon, and the two parties reunited\r\nat Queenston. Sending back part of the force, Drummond, with 815 men\r\nand two guns, held on his way to Lundy’s Lane. Brown, on receiving\r\nintelligence of Tucker’s advance on Lewiston, believing that his\r\nmore considerable stores at Fort Schlosser were threatened, and that\r\nPearson’s party at Lundy’s Lane was only a strong patrol, resolved to\r\nmake a countermove on Queenston and Fort George. Riall’s remaining\r\nbrigades at Twelve Mile Creek were under arms at daybreak to support\r\nPearson. Their advance was then countermanded, and they remained in\r\ncamp till noon, when a force, numbering 1230 rank and file, with four\r\nguns, under Colonel Scott, was ordered to march at once for Lundy’s\r\nLane. On neither side was there any immediate expectation of a battle.\r\n\r\nA little before five in the afternoon Brown detached a force of about\r\n1800 men and two guns under General Scott to advance on Queenston. On\r\ncoming in contact with Pearson’s outposts, Scott became aware that\r\nthe force in front of him was stronger than he had supposed, and\r\ndelayed his attack, while he sent back to Brown for more troops.\r\nRiall, who had ridden on to join Pearson, took Scott’s brigade for\r\nthe advance of Brown’s whole force. He at once sent back word to the\r\nforce advancing from Twelve Mile Creek, which was still three miles\r\naway, to retire on the heights near Queenston, and ordered Pearson to\r\nretreat on that point. After retiring half a mile, Riall and Pearson\r\nmet Drummond advancing. Drummond at once took the command, ordered\r\nthe position at Lundy’s Lane to be re-occupied, and sent word to\r\ncountermand Riall’s last order to Colonel Scott, whom he directed to\r\npress on and join him.\r\n\r\nScott (U.S.), fearing an ambush, advanced with great caution, which\r\njust allowed time for the British force to regain the hill before\r\nit could be occupied by the enemy. Drummond’s force now amounted to\r\nabout 1700 men, thus disposed. On the summit of the hill were two\r\nguns: a little behind them were five companies of the Royal Scots,\r\na detachment of the 41st, the 89th, with their left resting on the\r\nroad running parallel with the river from Queenston to Niagara Falls.\r\nThe line was prolonged towards the river by some of the 8th and some\r\nmilitia. On the road, somewhat retired, was Major Lisle’s troop of\r\nthe 19th Light Dragoons. Both flanks were thrown forward, the woods\r\non the right of the line being occupied by the Glengarry regiment, a\r\ncorps of the Macdonald clan raised in Canada, that fought all through\r\nthe war with great distinction. By a curious coincidence, Drummond\r\nhad under his command three regiments, in which he had served as a\r\nregimental officer; the Royal Scots, the 8th, and the 41st.\r\n\r\nScott commenced his attack about half past six, along the entire\r\nfront. On Drummond’s right and centre, the attack was not pushed\r\nhome, and the British guns on the hill, from their advantageous\r\nposition, had a decided superiority over the attacking artillery.\r\nBut on Drummond’s left, the attack was successful. A battalion,\r\nordered by Scott to make a wide turning movement through the dense\r\nforest between the road and the river, suddenly attacked the Canadian\r\nmilitia in flank, threw them into disorder, and captured some\r\nprisoners, occupied the road, and forced back Lisle’s troop of the\r\n19th for over a mile. At this juncture, General Riall was severely\r\nwounded, and, being taken to the road, was conducted by mistake, in\r\nthe growing darkness, into a party of the enemy, by whom he was at\r\nonce made prisoner. The Canadian militia, however, quickly recovered\r\nthemselves, and formed up in rear of the 89th, at right angles to\r\nthem, covering the flank and rear of the British position. They also\r\ncleared the road to the rear, and the enemy made no further headway\r\non this flank during the remainder of the battle.\r\n\r\nScott now made a determined attack, with the rest of his troops,\r\non the British centre. It was repulsed after some severe fighting,\r\nin which both sides suffered heavily. A lull in the action then\r\noccurred, during which the artillery on both sides maintained their\r\nfire. Scott, while reforming his ranks, was joined by Brown and\r\nthe rest of the United States’ troops; at the same time, Drummond\r\nwas joined by the rear division of Riall’s troops, which had been\r\nmarching and counter-marching, under conflicting orders, since they\r\nleft Twelve Mile Creek. With them came the second troop of the 19th.\r\n\r\n  “For a few minutes firing almost ceased, and this interval was\r\n  employed by the United States’ artillerymen in bringing forward\r\n  fresh supplies of ammunition, and a daring officer, Captain\r\n  Brooke, stealthily crept up the hillside until within a few yards\r\n  of the British battery, with a dark lantern, which he suspended\r\n  in a thicket, as a guide for his gunners to take aim by; for\r\n  although the moon had risen, its light was rendered faint and\r\n  uncertain by drifting clouds of smoke and dust, and the position\r\n  of either line of battle was simply indicated at intervals, by\r\n  the flash of their guns.”[64]\r\n\r\nDrummond employed part of his reinforcement to strengthen his right,\r\nwhile the remainder formed a second line in rear of the first. A\r\nfield gun was also brought up in line with the two guns on the hill.\r\n\r\nThe United States’ commander was now convinced that the capture\r\nof the hill and the guns on it was necessary to success. Forming\r\na brigade, 1400 strong, in the hollow of the hill, he sent them\r\nstraight against the guns. Part of them recoiled under the heavy\r\nfire, but one battalion was able to approach under a screen of dense\r\nthickets, and gained a position behind a log fence within twenty\r\nyards of the guns without being observed. Pouring in a volley, they\r\nrushed on the gunners with the bayonet, and were at once masters of\r\nthe guns, which were turned upon the British line. A large body of\r\nUnited States’ infantry were then brought up on to the hill, and\r\ntheir artillery ascended the slope at a gallop. In doing this, one\r\ngun, of which the drivers were killed by a sudden volley, was taken\r\nby the horses into the British ranks, and secured.\r\n\r\n  “The remainder of the British artillery was at the same time\r\n  brought forward, until the muzzles of the (opposing) guns were\r\n  only a few yards asunder, and the battle thenceforward became a\r\n  confused, ferocious and sanguinary struggle, waged frequently\r\n  at the bayonet’s point, or with clubbed muskets, the British\r\n  striving desperately to regain the ground they had lost, and\r\n  their opponents to thrust them down into the hollow beyond, and\r\n  drive them from the field. Regiments, companies, and sections\r\n  were broken up and mingled together. They retired, rallied, and\r\n  were led to the charge again.”[64]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF LUNDY’S LANE\r\n\r\n9 p.m. 25th. July, 1814.\r\n\r\nFrom L.L.H.S. Publications.\r\n\r\n  _Walker & Boutall sc._]\r\n\r\nFor over two hours this desperate struggle in the dark continued,\r\nwith varying fortunes. At one moment, the 103rd, a young regiment,\r\nwas forced back in disorder; at another the U.S. guns were captured,\r\nand two of them spiked. Neither side could make headway, in spite of\r\nfrequent attacks and counter-attacks. Drummond was severely wounded\r\nbut kept the field: nearly one-third of the British force were killed\r\nand wounded. The U.S. forces were in equally bad case. Three of their\r\ngenerals were wounded, while the rank and file had lost heavily. In\r\nthe confusion and darkness the whole force had become disorganized;\r\nScott’s brigade, that had commenced the fight, had dwindled to a few\r\ncompanies: there were an enormous number of stragglers. Closing their\r\nranks for a last attack the wearied British troops, headed by the\r\nlight company of the 41st, regained possession of the hill and of\r\nthe guns, just as Brown had decided on withdrawing. Desultory firing\r\ncontinued for a few minutes: it was not till near midnight that the\r\nBritish troops, wearied by prolonged marching and fighting, remained\r\nin undisturbed possession of the field. Two of the enemy’s guns\r\nremained in their possession, while one British gun was carried off.\r\n\r\nThus ended the battle of Lundy’s Lane, the most severely contested\r\naction of the war. On the British side both generals were severely\r\nwounded, one of them being taken prisoner. Out of a total strength\r\nof somewhat less than 3000, the total British loss amounted to 5\r\nofficers and 76 men killed, 30 officers and 532 men wounded, 14\r\nofficers and 219 men missing and prisoners. The disproportion of\r\nwounded to killed, in this and other actions, was mainly due to the\r\nfrequent use of buckshot by the enemy. The heaviest losses fell on\r\nthe Royal Scots and 89th, who, out of a total of about 900 present,\r\nsuffered a loss of 426. The 19th Light Dragoons had two wounded and\r\none missing, together with three horses killed, ten wounded, and one\r\nmissing. The United States’ loss was never correctly stated. Of the\r\nfour generals engaged, three were wounded, while the disorganization\r\nof their force of about 4500 men engaged, and the loss of 16 officers\r\nkilled and 56 wounded, makes it probable that their loss in killed\r\nand wounded was not less than 1200. Several hundred prisoners\r\nremained in the hands of the British. In his dispatch, General\r\nDrummond writes, “In reviewing the action from its commencement, the\r\nfirst object which presents itself as deserving of notice, is the\r\nsteadiness and good countenance of the squadron of the 19th Light\r\nDragoons, under Major Lisle, and the very creditable and excellent\r\ndefence made by the incorporated militia-battalion &c.” This refers\r\nto the first period of the action when the left of the line was\r\nforced back.\r\n\r\nThe following day, General Ripley, who had succeeded to the command\r\nof the United States’ troops, advanced across the Chippewa to see\r\nto his dead and wounded; finding the field in occupation of the\r\nBritish, he immediately retired, broke down the bridge, destroyed a\r\nquantity of camp equipage and stores, and retired precipitately to\r\nErie, which he reached on 27th. The light troops, cavalry and Indians\r\nwere sent in pursuit, and made a few prisoners. On reaching Erie,\r\nRipley at once set to work to enlarge and strengthen the defences, in\r\nanticipation of attack.\r\n\r\nDrummond, after repairing the bridge, and receiving some\r\nreinforcements that brought his effective strength up to 3150 men,\r\nfollowed in Ripley’s footsteps, and appeared before Erie, which he\r\ninvested on 3rd August. Ripley’s position was now very strong, with\r\nnew earthworks and batteries extending from the fort to the edge of\r\nthe lake. On the river side he was covered by the batteries at Black\r\nRock: while from the lake, his defences were flanked by the fire of\r\nthree gunboats. On the night of the 3rd, Drummond threw a small party\r\nof about 450 men across the river to capture the batteries at Black\r\nRock. Failing to effect a surprise, they recrossed, with the loss\r\nof 25 men k.w.m. Two days later, the spirits of the besieged were\r\nraised by the arrival of General Gaines to supersede Ripley. On the\r\nnight of the 12th, a daring exploit was performed by Captain Dobbs\r\nof the Royal Navy. With 75 seamen from Lake Ontario, he attacked\r\nand captured, in open boats transported overland, two of the three\r\ngunboats on Lake Erie: the third gunboat cut its cable, and escaped.\r\nOn the 13th, Drummond’s batteries opened fire on the enemy’s works,\r\nand continued the cannonade on the following day, preparatory to a\r\ngrand assault. At 2 A.M. on the 15th, the assault was delivered in\r\nthree columns. The right column, headed by Sergeant Powell of the\r\n19th Light Dragoons, “who was perfectly acquainted with the ground,\r\nvolunteered to act as guide, and preceded the leading subdivision in\r\nthe most intrepid style,” was to attack a work called Snake Hill at\r\nthe border of the lake. The picquet of cavalry under Captain Eustace,\r\n19th Light Dragoons was detailed to act with the right column. The\r\nrest of the squadron was drawn up in the rear of the most advanced\r\nbattery, in readiness to receive prisoners, and conduct them to\r\nthe rear. The centre and left columns were to assault the fort at\r\ndifferent points. The scaling ladders with the right attack were\r\ntoo short; after prolonged efforts, and suffering great losses,\r\nthe column was obliged to retire without gaining a footing. The\r\nleft column also was beaten back, losing its leader and many men.\r\nThe centre column, which was the weakest of the three, led by Lt.\r\nColonel Drummond, the general’s nephew, alone effected a lodgment,\r\nand maintained its position till daylight, in spite of the most\r\ndesperate efforts of the garrison. Lt. Colonel Drummond fell; but\r\nhis men, reinforced from the left column, continued to resist all\r\nattacks made to dislodge them, till a tremendous explosion of stored\r\nammunition took place, killing many, and forcing the remainder to\r\nretire. Almost every officer with the centre and left columns was\r\nkilled or wounded. This disastrous repulse cost the British force a\r\nloss of 905 of all ranks, killed, wounded and missing; great part of\r\nthe loss being ascribed to the explosion.\r\n\r\nDrummond continued the blockade, and his troops now began to suffer\r\ngreatly from sickness. On the 2nd September, General Brown, who\r\nhad recovered from his wound received at Lundy’s Lane, resumed\r\ncommand of the U.S. forces at Erie, in place of Gaines who had\r\nbeen severely wounded. On the morning of the 7th, a United States’\r\npicquet, consisting of an officer and 21 men, was surprised and\r\ncut off to a man, by a small party of infantry and a detachment of\r\nthe 19th Light Dragoons under Captain Eustace, the whole commanded\r\nby Captain Powell, D.A.Q.M.G. The General Order of the same day\r\nsays: “Sergeant Powell, 19th Light Dragoons, has been named to the\r\nLieutenant General as having again distinguished himself on this\r\noccasion.” This brave soldier was subsequently taken prisoner, and\r\nis believed to have died before he could be exchanged. On the 17th\r\nSeptember, favoured by a heavy fall of rain, Brown made a sortie\r\nin three strong divisions. The battery guards were surprised, and\r\nthe whole line of entrenchments was for a time in the assailants’\r\nhands; till Drummond, bringing up troops from the camp, drove out the\r\nenemy, and recovered possession of his batteries. The sortie cost\r\nthe British troops 609 killed, wounded and prisoners, in addition\r\nto three of their few heavy guns destroyed, and other damage. This,\r\ntogether with continuous bad weather and increasing sickness among\r\nhis troops, caused Drummond to give up the blockade, on the 21st, and\r\nwithdraw his Head Quarters across the Chippewa on the 24th, which was\r\ndone without molestation. A strong body of troops was maintained in\r\nadvance of the Chippewa, occupying the line of the Black Creek. In\r\nhis dispatch of 2nd October to Sir George Prevost, Drummond reports\r\nthe capture by the enemy of a patrol of a corporal and six men of\r\nthe 19th Light Dragoons. “The Dragoons must have been most culpably\r\ncareless and confident, or the circumstance could not have happened.”\r\nAbout the 8th October, General Izard, with a large body of U.S.\r\ntroops, arrived by land at Lewiston, from Sackett’s Harbour. Instead\r\nof crossing the river to Drummond’s rear, as he should have done, he\r\ncontinued along the river to Black Rock, and assumed the command at\r\nErie. Izard’s force now amounted to over 8000 men, from whom some\r\ndecisive action was to be expected. Izard advanced to Black Creek,\r\nand offered battle, which Drummond was not strong enough to accept.\r\nBeyond some skirmishing, Izard made no further use of his superiority\r\nof force, awaiting co-operation from the lake. But the U.S. squadron\r\non Ontario was held fast in Sackett’s Harbour by Sir James Yeo. Izard\r\nremained inactive till 20th October, when he fell back, and carried\r\nhis force across the river to Black Rock and Buffalo. On the 5th\r\nNovember, he blew up Fort Erie and evacuated the place. Drummond at\r\nonce disposed the men in winter quarters. Major Lisle’s squadron was\r\nordered to hold itself in readiness to proceed to Lower Canada, and\r\none troop under Captain Eustace was sent to Ancaster.\r\n\r\nSeveral times during the summer marauding parties from the United\r\nStates, taking advantage of the undefended state of the Detroit\r\nfrontier, had crossed the border, plundering and burning, and\r\ncarrying off peaceable inhabitants. Drummond was unable to spare any\r\nforce to meet this evil, and the province suffered cruelly. Towards\r\nthe end of October, a mounted force of 1500 undisciplined men, under\r\nGeneral McArthur, crossed the border by Lake St Clair, and marched\r\nto Moravian town on the Thames river, continuing eastwards in the\r\ndirection of Burlington Heights, where only a few militia and some\r\n300 of the 103rd, under Lt. Colonel Smelt, were stationed. Smelt at\r\nonce moved forward to Grand River with about 170 men of the 103rd,\r\n27 of the 19th Light Dragoons, 150 militia and some Indians. After\r\nmaking a demonstration of crossing, McArthur turned back and regained\r\nDetroit, on the 17th November, without having effected anything\r\nbeyond the destruction of a great quantity of property. “Both in\r\ntheir advance and in their retreat their progress was marked by\r\nplunder and devastation.” Captain Eustace and his party marched to\r\nDover.\r\n\r\nA return, dated 8th November, shows that out of 7552 men on the\r\nfrontier between Toronto and Long Point, 1327 were in hospital at\r\nthat date. The total strength of the 19th Light Dragoons’ squadron\r\nwas 123, of whom 34 were sick.\r\n\r\nThe operations for the year were at an end on this part of the\r\nfrontier. Fort Niagara still remained in British hands, and the\r\nprojected attack on Kingston had not been made. The only results\r\nof the strenuous efforts made by the United States’ government, at\r\nthis point, had been to show the improvement of their troops, both\r\nin generalship and fighting power, since the beginning of the war.\r\nBeyond this, there was nothing to show for the offensive operations\r\nundertaken by the United States during the year.\r\n\r\nThe abdication of Napoleon, and the peace concluded in Paris at\r\nthe end of May, set free for service in America the troops serving\r\nunder Wellington in the south of France. A number of regiments\r\nwere embarked at once for Quebec, so that, by the end of August,\r\nSir George Prevost had upwards of 16,000 British troops in Lower\r\nCanada. With them came instructions to attack Plattsburgh, which,\r\nto observers at a distance, appeared to be the point from which\r\nthe most formidable attack might be directed against Montreal. The\r\nstrategy was at fault, as the experience of the preceding year had\r\nshown that, while Kingston continued to be held in force, no attack\r\nfrom Plattsburgh was likely to be successful. On the other hand, a\r\nBritish success at Plattsburgh could lead to no decisive result.\r\nThe true point of attack was Sackett’s Harbour, on Lake Ontario.\r\nThe occupation and retention of this point would have destroyed the\r\nU.S. naval power on the lake; Montreal and Kingston would have been\r\nsecured from attack; and Sir Gordon Drummond would have been master\r\nof the situation on the Niagara frontier. The U.S. government gauged\r\nthe situation more correctly, and denuded Plattsburgh of troops to\r\nreinforce Sackett’s Harbour. The event showed that Plattsburgh was\r\nonly of secondary importance.\r\n\r\nFor the expedition against Plattsburgh Sir George Prevost formed\r\nthree brigades on the frontier extending from the Richelieu river\r\nto the St Lawrence commanded by Major Generals Power, Robinson and\r\nBrisbane. The whole division was under command of Major General de\r\nRottenburg, and amounted to 11,000 men. With it was the rest of the\r\n19th Light Dragoons not engaged on the Niagara frontier.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of September, Sir George Prevost, advancing by Chateaugay\r\nfrom the St Lawrence, crossed the frontier to Chazy, and, on the 5th,\r\nreached, without opposition, a point eight miles from Plattsburgh.\r\nThe U.S. troops about Plattsburgh, at the time, amounted to about\r\n1500 men, of inferior quality, under General Macomb. This force was\r\naugmented by about 3000 militia from the surrounding neighbourhood\r\nduring the operations, but neither in quality or numbers was it\r\nfit to stand before the troops under Prevost. On the 6th, the army\r\nadvanced on Plattsburgh, driving in the U.S. pickets and outposts.\r\nSo feeble was the resistance made that General Macomb mentions in\r\nhis dispatch that the British troops pressed on in column, not even\r\ndeigning to fire, except by their flankers and advanced patrols, on\r\nthe militia that they brushed out of their way. In the advance, the\r\n19th Light Dragoons had one man and two horses wounded, two men and\r\nsix horses missing. Plattsburgh stands on the Saranac creek which\r\nruns at right angles into Lake Champlain. The high ground on the\r\nsouth side of the Saranac was occupied by Macomb with some hastily\r\nconstructed redoubts. The houses on the north of the Saranac were\r\noccupied by British troops, on the 6th. On the lake lay the U.S.\r\nsquadron, consisting of four vessels and ten gunboats. The British\r\nsquadron, consisting of four vessels and twelve gunboats, was still\r\nat the north end of Lake Champlain, awaiting the completion of the\r\nflag-ship which had only been launched ten days previously, and whose\r\ncrew had hardly joined her from Quebec. Sir George Prevost had only\r\nto advance on the 7th to make himself master of the feeble defences\r\nopposed to him, when he suddenly conceived the idea that he must\r\nawait the co-operation of his lake squadron. For four days Prevost\r\nlay inactive, while he urged Captain Downie with his ill-prepared\r\nships to join him, and engage the enemy’s squadron: the time was\r\nutilised by Macomb in strengthening his defences and collecting\r\nreinforcements. On the 11th, the British squadron appeared in sight,\r\nand engaged the U.S. ships, while Prevost put his troops tardily in\r\nmotion. They forded the Saranac, and ascended the opposing heights,\r\nwhen, with victory in their grasp, they suddenly received the order\r\nto withdraw to their former positions. The British lake squadron,\r\nafter a most deadly contest of over two hours, had been completely\r\ndefeated, and Sir George Prevost at once threw up the sponge. The\r\nsame night, leaving his sick and wounded, together with a quantity\r\nof stores, he commenced a retreat, which much resembled a flight,\r\nto the Canadian frontier. In the many wars in which the British army\r\nhas fought, it would be hard to find a parallel instance in which\r\nBritish troops have been so mishandled. The co-operation of the fleet\r\nwas unnecessary, as the enemy’s squadron could not have maintained\r\nits position with the whole of Plattsburgh in British hands. Nine\r\nthousand of Wellington’s veterans, who had defeated Napoleon’s\r\nchoicest troops again and again, were made to retreat from an\r\ninferior force that could not have withstood them for an hour, with a\r\nloss of less than 40 killed since they had crossed the frontier. No\r\nwonder that the enemy first took the retreat for a _ruse de guerre_,\r\nand that a British General broke his sword, vowing he would never\r\nserve again. In the whole of the operations against Plattsburgh,\r\nthe land forces under Prevost’s immediate command suffered a total\r\nloss of 37 killed, 150 wounded and 55 missing. In their anger at the\r\nfiasco, an immense number of men deserted during the retreat, causing\r\na greater loss than a successful prosecution of the enterprise could\r\npossibly have entailed. The 19th Light Dragoons while covering the\r\nretirement, lost five men and horses taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nOnly brief mention need be made of land operations elsewhere, as\r\nthey do not come within the scope of operations in which the 19th\r\nLight Dragoons were concerned. In the middle of August, a combined\r\nmilitary and naval expedition fitted out from Bermuda, under Major\r\nGeneral Ross and Vice Admiral Cockburn, landed at Benedict in the\r\nPotomac river, 50 miles from Washington, and marched on that town. At\r\nBladensberg, on the 24th, Ross encountered a U.S. army of about 8000\r\nmen under General Winder, and gained a complete and easy victory,\r\ntaking 10 guns.[65] Washington was occupied the same evening. On\r\nthe following evening, after burning the most important public\r\nbuildings, in retaliation for the outrages committed on the Canadian\r\nnon-combatants, the force retired, and re-embarked on the 29th,\r\nwithout molestation.\r\n\r\nAt daylight on the 12th September, the same force landed 13 miles\r\nfrom Baltimore, and advanced on that place. On first coming in touch\r\nwith the enemy, Ross was killed by a chance shot. Colonel Brook\r\nassumed the command, and at about five miles from Baltimore a United\r\nStates’ force of about 7000 men was encountered and overthrown in\r\nless than half an hour. Two field pieces and many prisoners were\r\ncaptured. Preparations were then made for a combined attack on the\r\ncity, when it was discovered that the harbour was so effectually\r\nclosed by sunken vessels, that naval co-operation was impossible.\r\nIt being considered that, under these circumstances, the loss that\r\nmust be incurred in taking the place by storm would be out of\r\nproportion to any benefit to be gained, the troops were withdrawn,\r\nand re-embarked without the slightest molestation, on the 15th. The\r\ntroopships, after hovering on the coast, rather aimlessly for another\r\nmonth, then set sail for Jamaica, where an expedition was preparing\r\nagainst New Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe mistake that had been made by the United States government\r\nin the early part of the war, in under-rating the difficulty of\r\nconquering Canada, and in believing that the inhabitants would join\r\nthe invaders, was now to be repeated by the British government.\r\nBritish Ministers had been brought to believe that the inhabitants of\r\nLouisiana were disaffected to the U.S. government, and that the State\r\ncould easily be taken possession of. With this object, an expedition\r\nagainst New Orleans had been planned in England; and, it was in order\r\nto save the troops for this purpose, that the attack on Baltimore had\r\nbeen abandoned. New Orleans, though a great commercial centre, was\r\ndevoid of any military importance, and the expedition was destined to\r\nfurnish another example of the faulty strategy that was exhibited on\r\nboth sides during the war.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th December, the expedition under Major General Sir\r\nEdward Pakenham, appeared off the coast, and, on the night of the\r\n12th, captured the enemy’s squadron of gunboats. On the 16th, the\r\nlanding of the troops commenced, at the mouth of the Pearl river.\r\nConsiderable delay ensued, owing to the swampy nature of the\r\nground, and the advance did not approach the city till the 23rd.\r\nGeneral Jackson, in command at New Orleans, occupied a long line of\r\nentrenchments at right angles to the river. He was also assisted by\r\narmed vessels on the Mississippi which inflicted severe losses on the\r\nBritish troops, and greatly delayed their advance. On the morning\r\nof the 8th January, the attack was made, and repulsed with heavy\r\nslaughter. Pakenham fell at the head of his men; Major General Gibbs\r\ndied of his wounds the following day, and Major General Keane was\r\nseverely wounded. The total loss amounted to 2119 killed, wounded and\r\nmissing. So strongly were the enemy posted, that his loss did not\r\nexceed about 80 men. Under this disastrous repulse the expedition\r\nwithdrew on the 18th, and re-embarked. A portion of the expedition\r\nwas then directed against Fort Bowyer, on Mobile Point, which\r\ncapitulated, on 12th February, without resistance. Twenty-eight guns\r\nand over 300 prisoners fell into the hands of the British.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of March, news was received that a Treaty of Peace had\r\nbeen signed at Ghent on 24th December, and the war was at an end.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1814, the Head Quarters of the regiment was\r\nmoved from La Prairie to Chambly, where they remained as long as\r\nthe regiment was in Canada. The four troops left behind in Ireland\r\nhad been moved, on the embarkation of the regiment for Canada,\r\nto Radipole Barracks, near Weymouth; and thence to Maidstone, in\r\nFebruary 1814. In July of the same year, the regiment lost its\r\nColonel, Lord Howe, by death. In his place, Lieutenant General Sir\r\nWilliam Payne Bt., was transferred as Colonel, from the 23rd Light\r\nDragoons. He was an officer who had served in the Royal Dragoons,\r\nand commanded the British Cavalry at the battle of Talavera. His\r\nconnection with the regiment was very brief, as, in the following\r\nJanuary, he was appointed Colonel of the 12th Light Dragoons. In his\r\nplace, Major General Sir John Ormsby Vandeleur K.C.B., Lieutenant\r\nColonel in the regiment, was appointed Colonel.\r\n\r\nSir John Vandeleur had entered the army in 1781, and saw service in\r\nFlanders in 1794, and at the Cape of Good Hope in 1796. He commanded\r\na brigade of cavalry, under Lake, in the wars against Scindia and\r\nHolkar, 1803-5, and especially distinguished himself at Laswaree,\r\nand on other occasions. In 1807, he exchanged into the 19th as\r\nalready mentioned.[66] In 1811, he commanded an infantry brigade in\r\nSpain, under Wellington, and, at Ciudad Rodrigo, led the assault\r\nafter Craufurd’s fall, when he was severely wounded. Afterwards he\r\ncommanded the 4th cavalry brigade at Waterloo, and succeeded to the\r\ncommand of the whole of the cavalry, on Lord Uxbridge being wounded.\r\n\r\nDuring 1814, gold lace was substituted for silver in the uniform of\r\nthe regiment.\r\n\r\nIn May 1815, sanction was granted, under the following order, for\r\nMajor Lisle’s squadron to wear the badge “Niagara” for their services\r\non the Niagara frontier. The privilege seems to have been extended\r\nlater to the whole regiment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1815.\r\n\r\n19th Light Dragoons (Squadron under Major Lisle).

CALVERT\r\n      A. G.\r\n\r\n  Lt. General\r\n  Sir GEORGE PREVOST Bt.\r\n  or General Officer Commanding Canada.\r\n\r\nDetachments of the regiment were quartered at La Prairie, Isle aux\r\nNoix, Blairfindie, Quebec, Montreal, and St John’s.\r\n\r\nIn 1816, the whole of the ten troops of the regiment, amounting to\r\n620 rank and file, appear to have been in Canada. At the very end\r\nof the year, the strength of the Canadian establishment was fixed\r\nat 5000 rank and file. In order to bring it down to this number,\r\nthe 19th were held under orders to return to England, but, it was\r\nnot till the following 6th August that they embarked at Quebec,\r\nand landed at Tilbury, 13th September. On landing they marched to\r\nRomford, where they remained till the following March.\r\n\r\nThe execution done by the Polish lancers at Waterloo induced the\r\nmilitary authorities in England to arm four regiments with lances.\r\nAccordingly, the 9th, 12th, 16th, and 23rd Light Dragoons were\r\nequipped as Lancers, in September 1816. But great reductions in the\r\nmilitary establishments were in progress, and, in October 1817, the\r\n23rd were disbanded, their horses being made over to the 19th, whose\r\nestablishment was reduced to eight troops. At the same time, the 19th\r\nwere ordered to be equipped as lancers.[67]\r\n\r\nIn March 1818, the regiment was moved to Hounslow and Hampton Court,\r\nwith detachments at Pimlico and Kensington. On the 26th May, the\r\nregiment, together with the 10th Hussars, was reviewed at Hounslow by\r\nthe Prince Regent, and, in November, they were on duty, at Datchet,\r\nfor Queen Charlotte’s funeral.\r\n\r\nThe regimental muster rolls show that in October the regiment had 455\r\nrank and file.\r\n\r\nIn June of the following year the regiment moved to Brighton, with\r\ntroops at Hastings, Arundel and Rottingdean.\r\n\r\nA year later (June 1820), the regiment was ordered to Nottingham,\r\nwith troops at Mansfield, Sheffield, Loughborough, Peterborough and\r\nDerby. In spite of the distance, they marched to Hounslow to be\r\nreviewed, on 4th August, in company with the 10th Hussars and 12th\r\nLancers, by George IV., when His Majesty expressed his “unqualified\r\napprobation” of the three regiments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OFFICERS OF THE XIX^{TH} LANCERS, 1818.\r\n\r\n_to face p. 218._]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter, the regiment marched to Manchester, and, in the\r\nend of May, embarked for Ireland, where they were quartered at\r\nNewbridge. But further reductions were in progress, and, on 23rd\r\nAugust 1821, warrants were issued for the disbandment of the 18th\r\nLight Dragoons and 19th Lancers, which were carried into effect on\r\n10th September. The strength of the 19th, at the time of disbandment,\r\nwas 103 officers and non-commissioned officers, 336 rank and file,\r\n273 horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nTHE NINETEENTH “PRINCESS OF WALES’ OWN” HUSSARS\r\n\r\n(1858-1899)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nRAISING OF THE REGIMENT\r\n\r\n(1858-1882)\r\n\r\n  The East India Company raises European Cavalry regiments--Their\r\n  formation--The Bengal 1st European Light Cavalry--Services\r\n  transferred to the Crown--The “White Mutiny”--Made 19th Light\r\n  Dragoons, afterwards Hussars--General Pattle--Regiment at\r\n  Meerut--General Hall--Regiment ordered to England--Badges of old\r\n  19th Light Dragoons granted--Regiment ordered to Ireland--Guidons\r\n  of old 19th Light Dragoons presented to the regiment--Regiment\r\n  returns to England--Ordered on active service.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May 1857, the mutiny of the Bengal Native Army occurred, which so\r\nprofoundly changed the nature of British administration in India.\r\nThrough carelessness and false economy, the East India Company\r\nhad allowed the number of European troops in India to sink to a\r\ndangerously low level, in proportion to the number of native troops.\r\nAs against some 230,000 native soldiers, the European troops numbered\r\nless than 40,000 men, of whom about 23,500 were royal troops. The\r\nCompany’s European troops in India consisted, at that time, of nine\r\nbattalions of Infantry, seventeen troops of Horse Artillery, and\r\nforty-eight companies of Foot Artillery. Apart from other measures\r\nfor restoring tranquillity, it was determined to raise three\r\nadditional battalions of Infantry, and to replace the mutinous Bengal\r\nNative Cavalry by Europeans. Of the ten regiments of regular Bengal\r\nNative Cavalry, seven had mutinied, and two had been disarmed.\r\n\r\nIn November 1857, intimation was sent to the Governor General that\r\nit had been decided to form four regiments of Cavalry, for the\r\nCompany’s service, of men recruited in England, of ages between 20\r\nand 30 years, and of a standard height not less than 5 ft., and not\r\nexceeding 5 ft. 4 in. Each regiment was to consist of ten troops,\r\nwith 70 privates per troop, together with the usual number of\r\nofficers, non-commissioned officers and staff. All accoutrements,\r\narms, and equipments were to be of a lighter description than those\r\nin common use by British Cavalry: and the men were to be collected at\r\na depot in England (Warley), to be trained for three months, before\r\nbeing embarked for India. A lower standard of height than that of\r\nthe Royal Army was adopted, with the intention that the recruiting\r\nfor the Royal Army should not be interfered with, and it was thought\r\nthat, by tapping a new stratum of recruits, men would be easily\r\nobtained. These anticipations were justified. The whole nation had\r\nbeen roused by the sufferings of our countrywomen in India, and\r\nrecruits flocked in. Three weeks later, the Court of Directors were\r\nobliged to write to the Governor General that, in consequence of the\r\nvery rapid recruiting, accommodation could not be provided for the\r\nmen, in England, and it was necessary to embark a large body of them,\r\nfor Calcutta, at once.\r\n\r\nWith regard to these undersized men, it may be said here, that a\r\nlarge number of them made excellent soldiers in time; but there was\r\na considerable proportion of them, big men on short legs, over 25\r\nyears of age at the time of enlistment, who were unfit for cavalry\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nAfter being kept some time near Calcutta, the men were gradually\r\nforwarded to Allahabad, where they were collected in June 1858, an\r\nalmost undisciplined mob, without permanent officers, without horses,\r\nand without equipments. On the 17th June, we find Major General\r\nSir William Mansfield (afterwards Lord Sandhurst) writing to Major\r\nGeneral Sir Hope Grant, then in the field against the rebels: “We\r\nare about to organize the four regiments of Bengal Dragoons, and to\r\ndivide the recruits into four bodies without delay. How would it suit\r\nyou to have one of these young corps attached to the ‘Bays’ (2nd\r\nDragoon Guards), and another to the 7th (Hussars)? Not a man has ever\r\nbeen on a horse, and the men are at present armed with _muskets_.”\r\n\r\nBy the end of June, the apportioning of the men into regiments was\r\ncomplete, and, on the 3rd July, the regiment with which our interest\r\nlies, became established as the Bengal 1st European Light Cavalry,\r\nto be quartered at Allahabad. The other three regiments marched for\r\nvarious cantonments in North Western India. A fifth regiment was\r\nformed at Peshawur, in November, of volunteers from Royal infantry\r\nregiments, who had been formed into a cavalry corps for temporary\r\nservice during the Mutiny.\r\n\r\nTo officer each of these regiments, the officers of two of the ten\r\nmutinied or disbanded Bengal Native Cavalry regiments were utilized:\r\nbut, instead of placing them upon a single list, they were kept on\r\nseparate lists for promotion, which were styled Right and Left Wings,\r\ncorresponding to their late regiments. All officers newly appointed,\r\nwho had belonged to neither of the old Native regiments, were to be\r\nborne on the strength of the Right Wing, so that, in process of time,\r\nthe Left Wing was destined to disappear; but the process would have\r\nbeen one of thirty years or more, according to the rate of promotion\r\nthen existing in the Company’s service.\r\n\r\nThe Bengal 1st European Light Cavalry was officered by the surviving\r\nofficers of the 1st and 3rd Bengal Native Cavalry, both of which\r\nregiments had mutinied. For remounts, the men were given a number of\r\nhorses hastily purchased at the Cape of Good Hope and in Australia,\r\nmost of them wild unbroken bush horses that had never been handled.\r\nAn officer who served with the regiment at this time, writing of it\r\nforty years afterwards, says:--\r\n\r\n  “No regiments were ever raised under such absurd conditions, and,\r\n  if the object had been to prove them a failure, no course better\r\n  calculated to achieve that end could have been pursued. The only\r\n  old soldiers sent to assist us were two or three infantry men\r\n  from a Fusilier regiment, none higher in rank than Corporal.\r\n  When the authorities were addressed on this subject, one or two\r\n  cavalry soldiers, I think from the 7th Hussars, were sent; the\r\n  highest in rank being a Lance Corporal who was promptly made a\r\n  Troop Sergeant Major, and I don’t think turned out a success. The\r\n  horses, like the men, were all untrained, and some of the horses\r\n  from the Cape were perfect devils, very difficult to clean, and\r\n  for some time impossible to ride or to shoe. I have a vivid\r\n  recollection of one roan, who stood in his stall for days covered\r\n  with mud, because no one could go near him. Out of the crowd of\r\n  raw recruits, we had to find all our Non-Commissioned officers\r\n  from Troop Sergeant Major downwards, so it may be imagined what\r\n  little respect was paid to the highest grades.”\r\n\r\nOn the 1st November 1858, the Crown assumed the government of India,\r\nand the East India Company thenceforth ceased to exist. No attention\r\nwas paid to the view that might be taken of the change, in the\r\nranks of the Company’s army. The British soldier, though he yields\r\nto discipline, never forgets that he is a soldier by his own free\r\nwill; he objects to be treated like a conscript. The late Company’s\r\nEuropean soldiers quickly came to believe that their rights had been\r\ninfringed. Had they been asked to volunteer for service under the\r\nCrown, they would have done so almost to a man; but they objected\r\nto be handed over “like bullocks,” as they expressed it. The Indian\r\ngovernment consulted its legal advisers, who treated the objection as\r\na purely technical one, prompted by a wish for the offer of a bounty.\r\nSo long as the men were retained for the local service for which they\r\nhad enlisted, it was considered that they had no grievance. It was\r\ndecided that the men had no case, and a General Order to this effect\r\nwas published in April 1859. The agitation quickly assumed a serious\r\naspect, and, during May, there was a time when, in a few cantonments,\r\na collision between the Royal and the late Company’s European troops\r\nappeared possible. The movement was not confined to the newly raised\r\nregiments, but was equally shared in by the old soldiers of the late\r\nCompany, who had shown their fine qualities on many a hard fought\r\nfield. The behaviour of the 1st Bengal European Light Cavalry was\r\nsimilar to that of the local European forces in most other places.\r\nAll guards and barrack duties were performed without demur, but the\r\nmen refused to turn out for parade. On one occasion the canteen was\r\nbroken into, and an attempt was made to release prisoners. Mutinous\r\nlanguage was used to officers in a few instances, and shots fired\r\nin defiance, but not with evil intent. Under the circumstances\r\nalready related, it is surprising that nothing worse occurred. In one\r\ninstance alone, in one of the newly raised infantry regiments, was\r\nthere a dangerous attempt to act as an organized armed body hostile\r\nto the State. This was speedily repressed, and the ringleader shot.\r\n\r\nThe Calcutta government quickly recognized its mistake. In the end\r\nof June, orders were published allowing the men the option of\r\ndischarge, but no bounty was offered to those who elected to remain,\r\nwhile those who took their discharge were not allowed the option of\r\nre-enlistment, as long as they remained in the country. Under the\r\nfeeling of exasperation that had grown up, upwards of 10,000 men\r\nelected to take their discharge, of whom 2800 re-enlisted on reaching\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with the Indian local European forces, in 1859, has been\r\nfrequently cited as a cogent reason against the maintenance of a body\r\nof British troops in India, for local service only; a measure that\r\nwould overcome many difficulties now felt in army administration.\r\nThose who study the events of 1859 must recognize that the trouble\r\narose, not from the conditions of service, but from the mistakes\r\nof those in authority at Calcutta. The “White Mutiny” was no mere\r\noutbreak against discipline: it was the vindication of the men’s\r\nclaim to be consulted in the disposal of their services.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were in progress, orders were received for the\r\nregiment to march to Cawnpore, which it did in June.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1861, it was determined to cease the maintenance of any\r\nEuropean force for local service in India, and, on 6th May, the\r\nofficers, non-commissioned officers and men were called on to\r\nvolunteer for General Service. They responded, almost to a man, and\r\nthe regiment received the designation of the 19th Light Dragoons. In\r\nthe same way, the Bengal 2nd and 3rd European Light Cavalry became\r\nthe 20th and 21st Light Dragoons; the 4th and 5th being disbanded.\r\nAt the same time, the establishment was assimilated to that of other\r\nBritish cavalry regiments in India, viz. nine troops (one at the\r\ndepot in England) with 585 corporals and privates: 693 of all ranks.\r\nThree months later, under Horse Guards order of 17th August 1861,\r\nthe designation of the regiment was changed to the 19th Hussars.\r\nThe standard for recruits was assimilated to that of other Hussar\r\nregiments.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of February 1862, the regiment was moved to Lucknow.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th July, in the same year, the complete roll of officers was\r\ngazetted.\r\n\r\n  _Lieutenant Colonel_   Charles Vanbrugh Jenkins.\r\n\r\n  _Major_                John Hatfield Brooks.\r\n                         Roland Richardson.\r\n\r\n                         Henry Cadogan Craigie.\r\n                         _Sir_ John Hill, _Bt.

He was an old Company’s officer who had entered the\r\nservice in 1800. He served under Lord Lake in the Mahratta campaigns\r\nof 1803 and 1804, and was present at the battles of Alyghur, Delhi,\r\nLaswaree, the siege of Bhurtpore &c. He served through the Mahratta\r\nwar of 1817-18, and commanded the cavalry under Sir Charles Napier,\r\nduring the conquest of Scinde, and at the battles of Meeanee and\r\nHyderabad.\r\n\r\nUnder orders from the War office, dated 6th January 1863, the\r\nestablishment was reduced by one troop, leaving seven service troops\r\nand one at Maidstone.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn, orders were received for the regiment to march to\r\nMeerut, where it arrived 28th November. Here the regiment remained\r\ntill the end of 1867. The only events to be noticed during these four\r\nyears are a reduction of establishment by 56 privates in 1866: and\r\nthe presence of the regiment at the great Durbar held by the Viceroy,\r\nSir John Lawrence, at Agra, in November 1866, when the 19th were\r\nbrigaded with the 2nd Dragoon Guards.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1865, the regiment lost its Colonel by death. In\r\nhis place Lieutenant General John Hall was appointed Colonel.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th December 1867, the Head Quarters of the regiment, with\r\nfour troops, marched for Benares, being followed, a month later, by\r\nthe remaining three troops, who marched to Cawnpore.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary course of relief, the regiment was intended to leave\r\nIndia in 1872. In a sudden fit of economy, the Indian Government\r\ndecided to get rid of two cavalry regiments, so that, without any\r\nprevious warning, the regiment received telegraphic orders, on 18th\r\nJanuary 1870, to proceed to England immediately. Similar orders were\r\nsent to the 7th Hussars, then serving in India. Volunteering was at\r\nonce opened to men electing to serve in other regiments remaining in\r\nIndia, and, on 24th January, the regiment was re-united at Allahabad,\r\nwhence it proceeded to Bombay, where it embarked on board the _Jumna_\r\non the 14th February. So unexpected had been the move, that a draft\r\nfor the regiment, from England, joined it four days before sailing.\r\nThe strength of the regiment leaving India, was as follows: 18\r\nofficers, 51 sergeants and corporals, 7 trumpeters, 257 privates, 28\r\nwomen and 55 children.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd March, the regiment landed at Dover, and proceeded to\r\nCanterbury, whence all the Cavalry Depot troops, excepting those\r\nof the 20th and 21st Hussars, had been moved to Maidstone. But the\r\nBritish Government were as unwilling to have the home military\r\nestablishment increased by the two regiments thus sent from India,\r\nas the Indian Government had been to retain them, and the idea of\r\ndisbanding two regiments was entertained. The Manchester school was\r\npredominant; shortsighted financial considerations alone had any\r\nweight. The changes rung in the establishment of the regiment for\r\nthe next four months show the hesitating counsels that prevailed.\r\nOn the 1st April, one troop was absorbed. A month later, the\r\nestablishment was nominally fixed at 25 officers, 457 Sergeants and\r\nprivates, and 300 horses, but recruiting to make the regiment up to\r\nthat strength was forbidden. At the end of June the establishment of\r\nhorses was reduced to 200. A week later, the war between France and\r\nGermany broke out, while the question of the strength of military\r\nestablishments was still being bandied about between the Treasury and\r\nthe War Office. On the 1st August, orders were received to complete\r\nthe strength of the regiment up to 540 of all ranks, which was done\r\nby the end of September. The number of horses was also raised to 350.\r\n\r\nConsequent on the increase of establishment, an eighth troop was\r\nformed in February 1871.\r\n\r\nIn May, the Head Quarters of the regiment and five troops marched to\r\nBrighton; the other three troops going to the camp at Shorncliffe.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th June, an inspection of the regiment was held at Brighton\r\nby its Colonel, General John Hall.\r\n\r\nIn August 1872, the regiment marched to Aldershot, and, a few days\r\nafter arrival, marched to take part in the Wiltshire manœuvres at\r\nPewsey, where it was brigaded under the command of Major General\r\nShute C.B.; returning to Aldershot in September.\r\n\r\nDuring 1872, the regiment lost its Colonel, Lieutenant General Hall,\r\nwho was succeeded by General John Yorke C.B. He was an old officer of\r\nthe Royal Dragoons, which regiment he commanded in the Crimean War,\r\nand was severely wounded at Balaclava.\r\n\r\nIn June 1873, the regiment marched to Windsor, to take part in the\r\nreview held in honour of H.M. the Shah of Persia, on the 24th;\r\nreturning to Aldershot the following day.\r\n\r\nIn August, manœuvres were held at Dartmoor, in which the regiment\r\ntook part; proceeding by train as far as Exeter, and returning to\r\nAldershot by route march. The fine appearance of the regiment, and\r\nits proficiency in outpost and reconnoissance duties attracted more\r\nthan usual attention on this occasion.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1874, the regiment was granted the privilege of wearing the\r\nbadges so gloriously earned by the old 19th Light Dragoons.\r\n\r\n      HORSE GUARDS _24th Feb. 1874_.\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\n  I have the honor, by desire of His Royal Highness the Field\r\n  Marshall Commanding in Chief to acquaint you that Her Majesty has\r\n  been graciously pleased to approve of the regiment under your\r\n  command being permitted to wear the badges granted to the old\r\n  19th Light Dragoons for achievements during the present Century,\r\n  viz.:\r\n\r\n       The Elephant\r\n\r\n  “Assaye”      “Niagara”\r\n\r\n      J. W. ARMSTRONG,\r\n      Depy. Adj. General\r\n\r\n  To the\r\n  Officer Commanding\r\n  19th Hussars.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the “Seringapatam” badge, granted to the\r\nold 19th Light Dragoons for four campaigns in the last century, was\r\nwithheld. The 23rd of September is now observed as an annual holiday\r\nin the regiment, in commemoration of Assaye.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th May, the regiment took part in the review held at\r\nAldershot, in honour of H.I.M. the Emperor of Russia.\r\n\r\nAt the end of June, the regiment marched to new quarters at Hounslow,\r\nwith a troop at Hampton Court, and another at Kensington.\r\n\r\nAt the end of July 1875, the regiment marched to Leeds, with troops\r\nat Preston and Bury.\r\n\r\nIn June 1876, the regiment proceeded to Ireland. After going through\r\nthe drill season at the Curragh, it went into quarters at Longford,\r\nGort, Castlebar, Dunmore, and Athlone. In the following spring it\r\nreturned to the Curragh, and, in October, marched to Dublin, where it\r\nwas quartered in the Royal Barracks and Arbour Hill. In the following\r\nAugust, it again marched to the Curragh, whence, after a month, it\r\nmarched for Ballincollig, with out-quarters at Cork, Cahir, Limerick,\r\nBandon, Fermoy, and afterwards Waterford. In these quarters the\r\nregiment remained till May 1880, when it was again ordered to the\r\nCurragh. In August, the regiment again marched to Dublin, leaving\r\none squadron at the Curragh. Three months later, a wing was ordered\r\nto Ballinrobe and Lough Mask, by rail, in aid of the civil power,\r\nreturning to Dublin after a fortnight’s work, in, what was then\r\ncalled, the “Boycott” campaign.\r\n\r\nIn May 1881, the regiment moved to Dundalk, with two troops at\r\nBelfast and one at Belturbet. The time was one of much excitement in\r\nIreland, when the Land League conspiracy was in full force, and the\r\nregiment was employed, during the winter, in much harassing work in\r\nsupport of the civil power.\r\n\r\nWhile at Belfast the regiment became possessed of some greatly prized\r\nrelics of the old 19th Light Dragoons, through the generosity of a\r\nlady whose husband had served in the old regiment. As is well known,\r\nall cavalry regiments except Hussars and Lancers, at the beginning\r\nof the century, had a standard or guidon for each squadron. After\r\ntheir return from India, and shortly after the conferring of the\r\nElephant and Assaye badges (1807) the 19th Light Dragoons received\r\na new set of guidons.[68] On the regiment being equipped as Lancers\r\n(1817) the guidons could no longer be used, and, on the disbanding\r\nof the regiment they became the property of the Colonel, Sir John\r\nVandeleur. At his death he bequeathed them to his relative Major\r\nWilliam Armstrong of Farney Castle, Thurles, who had served in the\r\n19th from 1809 to 1819. Major Armstrong’s widow now made known her\r\nwish to restore the guidons to the regiment that bears the number and\r\nbadges which the old regiment so worthily earned. On the 28th March\r\n1882, the Belfast squadron paraded, under Lieutenant Colonel Coghill,\r\nand received the guidons with a royal salute. The Princess of Wales’\r\nOwn Yorkshire Regiment (formerly the 19th Foot) lent the services of\r\ntheir band, and the guidons were marched in all honour, through the\r\ntown, to barracks, where they were deposited in the Mess Room, after\r\na royal salute and an address to the squadron from Colonel Coghill.\r\n\r\nThe honorary guidon granted to the old regiment for Assaye, has not\r\nbeen traced. If it is still in existence, it is to be hoped that the\r\npossessor will restore it to its rightful guardians.\r\n\r\nAccording to the old custom one guidon in each regiment was known\r\nas the King’s. The King’s guidon was of crimson silk with the\r\nUnion badge in the centre. The regimental guidons were of the same\r\ncolour as the regimental facings, with the regimental badge in the\r\ncentre. Guidons were discarded on active service, after 1811, if not\r\nearlier.[69]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OFFICER OF THE XIX^{TH} HUSSARS, 1882.\r\n\r\n  _to face p. 232._]\r\n\r\nIn June 1882, the regiment received orders to return to England,\r\nand, while on the march for Aldershot, where it arrived 14th July,\r\nnews was received that it was to proceed at once to Egypt on active\r\nservice. Weak and sickly men were drafted into Depot, to remain\r\nbehind, the four squadrons being completed by volunteers from other\r\nregiments and from the Reserve.

In the beginning of 1881, a\r\nspirit of insubordination began to show itself among the officers of\r\nthe Egyptian army, who quickly recognised their own power to enforce\r\ndemands, and adopted as leader, one of their number, Said Ahmed\r\nArabi, better known as Arabi Pasha. By September, the pretensions\r\nof the army had so far increased that, they forced the Khedive to\r\ndismiss his Ministers. Attempts were soon afterwards made to get rid\r\nof the Anglo-French control. Arabi’s influence increased daily; he\r\ncaused himself to be appointed Minister of War; and, by April 1882,\r\nhad practically got the whole of the country into his hands. The\r\nKhedive was helpless. In May, the French and English fleets were\r\nsent to Alexandria, in order to strengthen the Khedive’s hands.\r\nBut matters did not improve: Arabi openly assumed the direction of\r\naffairs, and began to strengthen the forts commanding the Alexandria\r\nharbour. On the 11th June, serious riots broke out in Alexandria,\r\nin the course of which a number of Europeans were killed, and their\r\nhouses pillaged. It was seen in England that a military expedition\r\nto restore order would probably be necessary, and preparations, in\r\nanticipation, began to be made.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the work on the Alexandria fortifications had so\r\nfar advanced as to endanger the safety of the fleets. The French\r\nGovernment was unwilling to take action: the remonstrances of the\r\nBritish Admiral were met by evasions and denials from Arabi Pasha.\r\nAt last, on 11th July, after due notice, the forts were bombarded\r\nand destroyed by the British fleet. A force of seamen and marines\r\nwas landed to secure the safety of the Khedive, and put an end to\r\nthe pillaging and burning of the town by Arab marauders, and, on\r\nthe 17th, two battalions of British infantry, from Cyprus, under\r\nMajor General Sir Archibald Alison, landed to hold the town. On the\r\n20th, the British Government definitely decided to send a military\r\nexpedition to Egypt, to restore the Khedive’s authority. The French\r\nGovernment refused to co-operate, and withdrew from further action.\r\n\r\nThe force sent from England and the Mediterranean stations amounted\r\nto 25,450 men, of whom 2400 were cavalry: the whole being commanded\r\nby Lieutenant General Sir Garnet Wolseley. There being no fear of\r\ntheir being attacked at sea, they were sent without convoy, as\r\nsoon as the ships could be got ready. By the 11th August, the last\r\ntransport had sailed from England for Alexandria. The 19th Hussars\r\nwere among the last to go. On the 10th August, they embarked at\r\nSouthampton, in the _Assyrian Monarch_ and the _Montreal_, with a\r\ntotal strength of 33 officers, 553 non-commissioned officers and\r\nprivates, and 464 horses, under command of Lieutenant Colonel K. J.\r\nW. Coghill. Previous to this, a detachment of 20 men under Lieutenant\r\nAylmer had sailed in the _Orient_ as escort to H.R.H. the Duke\r\nof Connaught. It was also arranged for a Contingent from India to\r\noperate from Suez, consisting of one battalion of British infantry,\r\nthree battalions of Native infantry, and three regiments of Native\r\ncavalry, under command of Major General Sir Herbert Macpherson.\r\n\r\nArabi’s army, at the beginning of July, consisted only of about 9000\r\nmen. By calling out reserves, and enlisting Arabs, it soon reached\r\nthe number of 60,000 men, and eventually amounted to 100,000.\r\n\r\nBefore the expedition left England, it had been determined to seize\r\nthe Suez Canal, and advance on Cairo from Ismailia; but, as it was\r\nexpedient that the Canal should not be blocked or injured, Alexandria\r\nwas appointed as the rendezvous of the troops on the Mediterranean\r\nside, and measures were taken to spread the belief that the advance\r\non Cairo would be made from that place.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the troops being gathered at Alexandria, on\r\nthe 18th August, preparations were made as if an attack on Aboukir\r\nwas intended. Troops were re-embarked, and sailed under convoy of\r\nthe fleet, at noon on the 19th, anchoring in Aboukir Bay the same\r\nafternoon. After dark, while demonstrations of bombarding the Aboukir\r\nforts were made, the transports weighed anchor, entered the Canal,\r\nand commenced landing at Ismailia on the 20th. The movement was\r\nunexpected by the enemy, and no resistance was experienced. By the\r\n22nd, complete command had been gained of the whole Canal from Port\r\nSaid to Suez. On the 21st, Nefisha, four miles in front of Ismailia,\r\nwas occupied. Early on the 24th, a small force was pushed forward\r\nto El Magfar, which was occupied after a slight skirmish, in which\r\nLieutenant Aylmer’s detachment of the 19th Hussars took part. At El\r\nMagfar, it was found necessary to push on to Tel-el-Mahuta, to secure\r\nthe water supply. The place was strongly occupied by the enemy, and\r\nthe small British force was exposed to long range fire of guns and\r\nsmall arms, for many hours, while reinforcements were coming up,\r\nwhich did not happen till the evening. The next morning, the whole\r\nforce advanced, and occupied Tel-el-Mahuta after a slight opposition,\r\nwhile the cavalry pushed forward, and occupied the enemy’s camp at\r\nMahsamah without resistance. Seven guns, with a large quantity of\r\nsmall arms, ammunition and stores, fell into the hands of the British\r\ntroops. Early on the 26th, Kassassin was occupied by a brigade of\r\ninfantry under Major General Graham, and the troops from Suez began\r\nto arrive at Ismailia.\r\n\r\nThe 19th Hussars, in the _Assyrian Monarch_ and the _Montreal_, did\r\nnot reach Alexandria in time to take part in these operations. They\r\nreached Ismailia on the 24th, and completed their disembarkation\r\nby the evening of the 26th. The duty assigned to them was to act\r\nas Divisional troops; the Right Wing, consisting of two squadrons\r\nunder Lieutenant Colonel Coghill, formed part of the 1st Division\r\nunder Lieutenant General Willis; the remaining two squadrons, under\r\nLieutenant Colonel A. G. Webster, formed part of the 2nd Division\r\nunder Lieutenant General Sir E. Hamley. One troop was detailed as\r\nescort to Sir Garnet Wolseley throughout the campaign. The Right Wing\r\njoined the Head Quarters of the 1st Division at Tel-el-Mahuta, on the\r\nevening of the 27th.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th, a demonstration was made by the enemy against Graham’s\r\nforce at Kassassin. The Right Wing of the 19th was ordered in support\r\nto Mahsamah; but, on its being ascertained that no serious attack\r\nwas intended they returned to Tel-el-Mahuta. Graham, having been\r\nreinforced, and expecting the Heavy Cavalry Brigade to join him, made\r\na general advance after sunset. The orders for the heavy cavalry had,\r\nhowever, miscarried, and did not reach Major General Lowe for several\r\nhours. Making a wide sweep into the desert, Lowe fell upon the left\r\nof the enemy in the dark, and charged, rolling up their infantry;\r\nthe darkness made pursuit impossible. The sound of the heavy firing,\r\ncaused the Division at Tel-el-Mahuta to turn out again, but after a\r\nbrief advance they returned to camp, with the exception of the 19th\r\nHussars, who pushed on to Kassassin, which they reached at daybreak.\r\nIt was not till noon, after visiting the scene of the previous\r\nnight’s encounter, that they were able to off-saddle and rest.\r\n\r\nThe following twelve days were spent in preparing for the advance\r\non Tel-el-Kebir, 13 miles from Kassassin, where Arabi’s army had\r\nconstructed a formidable line of entrenched works. During these days,\r\nthe 19th Hussars and the Indian Native Cavalry were employed in\r\ncontinual outpost and reconnoissance duties. On the 5th, Lieutenant\r\nHolland was badly wounded.\r\n\r\nBy the 8th, all was ready for massing the whole force at Kassassin\r\npreparatory to the advance on Tel-el-Kebir. Early on the 9th, Arabi\r\nadvanced in force on Kassassin, attacking in two separate bodies\r\nsimultaneously, one in front from Tel-el-Kebir, and the other in\r\nflank from Es Salihiyeh. Willis repelled the double attack with ease,\r\nand pushed the enemy back to within cannon shot of Tel-el-Kebir,\r\ncapturing four guns.\r\n\r\nSoon after dark on the 12th, the whole force consisting of 17,000\r\nmen, with 61 guns, moved out of camp to some high ground in front of\r\nKassassin, in preparation for an attack on Arabi Pasha’s entrenched\r\nlines. At 1.30 in the morning, the troops moved silently forwards\r\nthrough the desert, their march directed by a naval officer steering\r\nby the stars. The four infantry brigades, in two lines, led the\r\nway, supported on the right by the heavy cavalry brigade and horse\r\nartillery, and on the left by the naval brigade. In rear of the\r\nnaval brigade, followed the 19th Hussars under Lieutenant Colonel\r\nCoghill. One troop of the regiment remained at Mahsamah, and another\r\nat Tel-el-Mahuta, to guard those points. At five in the morning\r\nthe attack was delivered; after half an hour’s severe fighting, the\r\nBritish infantry was in complete possession of the lines. While the\r\nheavy cavalry pushed on to Zagazig to cut off fugitives, the 19th,\r\nunder Coghill, passed through an opening in the entrenchments, and\r\nseized the Tel-el-Kebir railway station and bridge, cutting off a\r\ngreat number of fugitives. Thence the pursuit was continued for\r\nthree hours, when the 19th returned to the enemy’s late camp. In\r\nthe afternoon they started again in the track of the heavy cavalry,\r\nleaving a troop to protect burial parties, and reached Belbeis that\r\nevening. On the following evening Cairo was taken possession of, and\r\nArabi surrendered himself. The only casualty in the regiment was\r\nLieutenant Barclay who was struck by a fragment of shell from one of\r\nthe first guns fired by the enemy at Tel-el-Kebir.\r\n\r\nThe war was over. A medal, with clasp for Tel-el-Kebir, was given to\r\nall who took part in the campaign. The medals were presented to the\r\nregiment by Lady Dufferin, in Her Majesty’s name, in the following\r\nFebruary. H.H. the Khedive also gave a star.\r\n\r\nA few weeks after the arrival of the regiment in Cairo, a virulent\r\nepidemic attacked the horses. In order to shake it off, the regiment\r\nwas moved to Helouan, at the end of the first week in November, with\r\n248 sick horses, 56 having died in Cairo. A good deal of sickness\r\nalso set in among the men. In the following March the regiment\r\nreturned to Cairo, and occupied the Abassiyeh barracks, having lost\r\n18 men and 141 horses in the interval. When the regiment went to\r\nEgypt it had four coloured squadrons, chesnut, bay, brown, and black,\r\nwhile the band were mounted on greys. Experience showed that the\r\ngreys bore the climate better than any others; the chesnuts also bore\r\nthe climate well. The dark coloured horses suffered most, and were\r\nmore liable, than the others, to sore backs. In respect to age, the\r\npercentage of deaths among horses between five and ten years, was\r\ndouble that among horses between ten and fifteen years. In the hurry\r\nof departure from England, about twenty horses, over fifteen years of\r\nage, were taken. They were employed as waggon horses, and had perhaps\r\nharder work than those under saddle; yet they stood the climate and\r\nwork better than all the others.\r\n\r\nAffairs in Lower Egypt, to outward appearance, seemed to be settling\r\ndown so satisfactorily that, in November, the regiment received\r\norders to hold itself in readiness to proceed to England. This\r\nprospect endured only for a week, when news from Upper Egypt was\r\nreceived, altering all arrangements.\r\n\r\nWhile the British government were busying themselves with Lower\r\nEgypt, they paid scanty attention to the Soudan, which they regarded\r\nas a burden and encumbrance that Egypt would do well to get rid of.\r\nThe Khedive’s government did not hold this view, and continued to\r\noccupy themselves in dealing with a movement that had originated in\r\nKordofan, the importance of which was greatly under-estimated at\r\nthe time. Simultaneously with the insubordination of the Egyptian\r\narmy and the rise of Arabi Pasha, another pretender to power, of a\r\nmore serious type had arisen in the South. In May 1881, an Arab,\r\nin Kordofan, named Mahomed Ahmed, proclaimed himself to be the\r\nMahdi, and preached a religious war. Matters were not improved by\r\ncommunications from Arabi, published in the Soudan, proclaiming\r\nthat the Khedive’s government was at an end, and that no obedience\r\nshould be paid to it. By the end of 1882, the Mahdi had gathered a\r\nlarge force of fighting men, and had inflicted several disastrous\r\ndefeats on the Egyptian troops. In April 1883, an Egyptian force,\r\nwhich came to be known as the “English Army,” was organized at\r\nKhartoum, under the command of Major General Hicks, who had with\r\nhim a number of English officers, to advance on Kordofan, and put\r\ndown the revolt.[70] In October, this force was utterly destroyed,\r\nand the whole of the Soudan was in a blaze. It was at once realized\r\nthat the reconquest of Kordofan and the complete suppression of\r\nthe Mahdi would require operations on a scale that could not then\r\nbe undertaken. A complete withdrawal from the Western Soudan was\r\ntherefore determined on. To effect this, Colonel Gordon with £40,000\r\nwas sent to Khartoum. Meanwhile, the uprising of the tribes had\r\ndeveloped in another direction.\r\n\r\nIn August 1883, a slave trader, named Osman Digna, in the Eastern\r\nSoudan, had raised the tribesmen, in the name of the Mahdi, and\r\nattacked the Egyptian posts in the vicinity of Suakin, the principal\r\nseaport of the Soudan, laying siege to Sinkat and Tokar. An Egyptian\r\nforce for the relief of these places was organized in Cairo, and\r\nsent down, under Major General Baker, in December. On the 4th\r\nFebruary 1884, while advancing to the relief of Tokar, it was utterly\r\ndestroyed, Baker and his staff making their escape with difficulty.\r\nThe fall of Sinkat and massacre of its garrison quickly followed. The\r\npresence of British men-of-war at Suakin, alone saved that place.\r\nIt was evident that without British troops nothing could be done.\r\nBut beyond securing the safety of Suakin and effecting the relief of\r\nTokar, the British Government had no definite plans.\r\n\r\nTo effect these objects, a force was organized at Cairo, under Major\r\nGeneral Graham, and dispatched from Suez. The 19th Hussars commanded\r\nby Lieutenant Colonel A. G. Webster, left Cairo on the 17th February,\r\nand embarked in the _Osiris_ and the _Neera_, with a strength of\r\n20 officers, 457 non-commissioned officers and men, and 395 horses.\r\nThree hundred of the horses were small Syrian Arabs procured from the\r\nEgyptian cavalry. The force was destined to land at Trinkitat, about\r\n50 miles south of Suakin, and the nearest point on the coast to Tokar.\r\n\r\nThe _Osiris_ reached Trinkitat on the 22nd February, and the\r\nportion of the 19th on board, disembarked the following day. In a\r\nreconnoissance made on the 24th, they came in touch with the enemy at\r\nonce. The _Neera_, less fortunate, struck on a rock off Suakin, and\r\nbecame a total wreck, though men and horses were all saved; but they\r\ndid not reach Trinkitat till the 25th. The regiment was brigaded with\r\nthe 10th Hussars and mounted infantry, about 750 men in all, under\r\nColonel Herbert Stewart. On the 28th, the whole force, consisting of\r\nabout 4500 men, moved from Trinkitat to Fort Baker, but, before this,\r\nthe news of the fall of Tokar had been received.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th, the force advanced against the enemy, who occupied a\r\nstrong position at El Teb. Moving in a large square, they found the\r\nArab force in position on an isolated ridge covered with bush scrub,\r\nand protected with parapets and rifle pits. A squadron of the 10th\r\nHussars covered the front and left face of the square; a troop of the\r\n19th covered the right face. The rest of the cavalry were disposed in\r\nrear of the square, in three lines, commanded respectively by Lieut.\r\nColonel Wood, 10th Hussars, Lieut. Colonels Barrow and Webster, 19th\r\nHussars. By their defeat of General Baker, and the capture of Tokar,\r\nthe enemy had become possessed of guns, small arms and ammunition,\r\nwhich they used very efficiently. As the British force came within\r\nrange, the cavalry cleared away from the front of the square, which\r\nmoved to the right, across the front of the position, so as to attack\r\nthe left flank of the enemy, and the British guns came into action.\r\nIn forty minutes, the enemy’s guns being silenced, the square moved\r\nforward again. As they approached the ridge, the enemy’s fire ceased,\r\nand, in small groups of twenty and thirty men, the Arabs dashed at\r\nthe face of the square with the most reckless valour. Not one of them\r\nsucceeded in reaching it. Again the British infantry advanced, and\r\nagain with desperate courage a great force of Arabs hurled themselves\r\non the British bayonets. There are no braver men than the Arabs of\r\nthe Soudan. Armed with sword and spear, in spite of hundreds being\r\nshot down, many of them succeeded in coming hand to hand with their\r\nfoes and the matter was decided by the bayonet. Thus, fighting at\r\nevery step, the British infantry swept steadily along the whole line\r\nof the enemy’s position, capturing seven guns in their progress. The\r\nenemy’s number was computed at from 6000 to 10,000 men. Of these,\r\nover 2000 lay dead on the ridge. As the remainder drew off across\r\nthe plain beyond, the first two lines of British cavalry swept round\r\nthe end of the ridge, and pursued. After driving the main body of\r\nthe enemy before them for some distance, it was found necessary to\r\nreturn to encounter a large body of the enemy they had passed in\r\nthe broken ground, and that now interposed between them and the\r\ninfantry. The 10th Hussars, and two squadrons of the 19th under\r\nLieutenant Colonel Barrow, charged a large body of Arabs composed of\r\nhorsemen, men on camels, and footmen, and at once became involved in\r\na desperate hand to hand conflict. This body of Arabs had not been\r\nengaged with our infantry, and were quite fresh. Thirty Arab horsemen\r\ncharged one of the leading squadrons, three of them getting through\r\nand wheeling their horses in pursuit regardless of the second line.\r\nThe Arab swordsmen and spearmen, taking advantage of the scrub and\r\nbroken ground, hamstrung horses as they passed, and then attacked\r\nthe riders. Captain Freeman of the 19th and several men were\r\nkilled, and many wounded. Of all those who lost their horses in the\r\n_mêlée_, Colonel Barrow alone escaped alive. His horse was killed,\r\nand he received a thrust from a spear that passed through his arm\r\nand penetrated his side. Surrounded by numbers of the enemy, he must\r\nhave been killed, had it not been for the devotion of Quarter Master\r\nSergeant William Marshall who rode to his assistance, seconded by\r\nSergeant Fenton and Private Boseley. Marshall gave the Colonel his\r\nhand. Running in this fashion, in rear of the charging squadrons,\r\nBarrow, with the heavy spear swaying to and fro in his side,\r\nmanaged to get free of the enemy before he sank down. His attendant\r\ntrumpeter, in spite of sixteen terrible wounds, kept his horse going,\r\nand escaped from the press, to die of his injuries later. Captain\r\nJenkins, on whom the command of the two squadrons devolved, on Barrow\r\nbeing disabled, was engaged by three of the enemy at once. His horse\r\nwas wounded in three places, but he himself escaped with a slight\r\nwound. Horsemen, as a rule, have little difficulty in dispersing and\r\ndriving before them disordered infantry: but, so extraordinary was\r\nthe activity and bravery of the Arabs, and the skill with which they\r\nused their spears and two-handed swords that, in the uneven ground\r\ncovered with low mimosa bushes, they were more than a match for\r\nhorsemen. It was not till some men had dismounted, and opened fire on\r\nthem, that they sullenly drew off and retreated.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the other two squadrons of the regiment, acting\r\nindependently under Lieutenant Colonel Webster and Major\r\nHanford-Flood, had cleared the flank of numerous small parties of\r\nthe enemy. By 1.30 the action was at an end. The total British\r\nloss was 34 killed or died of wounds, and 155 wounded. To this\r\nthe 19th Hussars contributed one officer killed, two wounded, 13\r\nnon-commissioned officers and men killed or died of wounds, 20\r\nwounded; a heavier loss than fell on any other regiment engaged\r\nat El Teb. Every single casualty in the regiment was caused in\r\nhand-to-hand combat, by sword or spear. For his gallant behaviour,\r\nQuartermaster Sergeant William Marshall received the Victoria Cross.\r\nLieutenant Colonel Barrow’s wound was of so terrible a nature that it\r\nwas not thought possible he could survive, but he lived to go through\r\nanother and more arduous campaign.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the force advanced on Tokar. Sergeant James Fatt\r\nof the 19th while scouting in advance, rode boldly into the village,\r\nwhile it was still uncertain whether there would be any opposition,\r\nand brought out one of the villagers. Osman Digna’s camp was taken\r\nwithout resistance: two guns and a great quantity of small arms,\r\nammunition and stores, captured from General Baker’s force, being\r\ntaken by the cavalry.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th March, the regiment paraded, for inspection by General\r\nGraham and Colonel Stewart, and received complimentary addresses from\r\nboth officers.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th, the force re-embarked at Trinkitat, and landed at Suakin\r\nthe following day, to encounter Osman Digna in person, who was\r\nencamped at Tamai, sixteen miles from Suakin. On the night of the\r\n12th, the whole force bivouacked in front of Osman Digna’s position;\r\nthe infantry at about one mile, the cavalry four miles in rear of\r\nthe infantry. At eight the next morning, the advance commenced:\r\nthe two infantry brigades in squares, the cavalry in rear of the\r\nleft. The Arab skirmishers, who had pelted the British encampment\r\nwith rifle fire during the night, fell back, increasing in numbers\r\nas they retired. Seeing a great number of the enemy in front of\r\nthem, massed in a ravine, the front line of the 2nd brigade charged\r\nwith the bayonet, destroying the formation of their square. The\r\nactive Arabs broke into the opening, stabbing and slashing at close\r\nquarters. Numbers followed, and for a few minutes a catastrophe was\r\nimminent. The cavalry galloped forward on the left, dismounted, and\r\npoured volley after volley into the flank of the advancing Arabs,\r\nwhile the bayonet and spear contended for victory within the square\r\nitself. The 1st brigade, which had repulsed a similar charge, swept\r\nthe right face of the 2nd brigade square with its fire, and, in a few\r\nminutes, the last surviving Arab who had penetrated the square had\r\npaid the penalty. The ranks were reformed, and the infantry advance\r\nwas resumed, the cavalry clearing away the numerous small parties of\r\nthe enemy who still clung to the broken ground. The battle was over.\r\nIn those few minutes over 2000 of the enemy had fallen, out of an\r\nestimated number of 12,000: of the British force, 109 officers and\r\nmen were killed, and 112 wounded. The 19th Hussars lost one killed\r\nand two wounded.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the force advanced to Tamai, burned Osman\r\nDigna’s camp, and returned to Suakin. For a fortnight the force\r\nlay at Suakin, the cavalry and mounted infantry being employed in\r\ndaily reconnoissances. On the 27th, the whole force advanced for a\r\ndistance of 25 miles to ascertain if the enemy remained in any force.\r\nA few hundreds only were found. Beyond some desultory skirmishing,\r\nwhich drew from the General in command a highly complimentary order,\r\nnothing serious occurred, and the force returned to Suakin.\r\n\r\n  “Too high praise can scarcely be given to the Cavalry and Mounted\r\n  Infantry, who bore the brunt of a long skirmish on rocky ground\r\n  unsuited for cavalry action, and who, the following morning,\r\n  although nearly twenty-four hours without water for their horses,\r\n  performed admirable scouting duty during the advance of the force\r\n  in a mountainous district, when distant peaks and ridges had to\r\n  be crowned and watched.”[71]\r\n\r\nIt being considered that the objects of the expedition had been\r\nfully attained, the force was broken up and withdrawn. The 19th\r\nembarked on the 1st April, and returned to Cairo on the 6th.\r\n\r\nBy G.O. 10 of January 1885 the regiment was permitted to add the date\r\n“1884” to the badges on its appointments. A medal with clasps for El\r\nTeb and Tamai were granted to those present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGN ON THE NILE\r\n\r\n1884-1899\r\n\r\n  Troubles in the Western Soudan--Expedition to relieve\r\n  Khartoum--19th ordered up the Nile--Korti--The Desert\r\n  Column--Action at Abu Klea--Action at Abu Krou--Quartermaster\r\n  Lima killed--The horses--Metemmeh--Fall of Khartoum--Return of\r\n  the Column--The River Column--Action at Kirbekan--Return of the\r\n  Column--Summer Quarters--Regiment returns to Cairo--Squadron sent\r\n  to Suakin--Serious losses--Returns to Cairo--Designation granted\r\n  of “Princess of Wales’ Own”--Death of Colonel Barrow--19th\r\n  returns to England--Badge of “Mysore” granted--19th embarks for\r\n  India--Bangalore--Secunderabad.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, matters in the Western Soudan had steadily been\r\ngetting worse. In March, the Mahdi’s forces had reached Khartoum;\r\nby the end of May Berber had fallen, cutting off communication\r\nbetween Khartoum and Cairo, and the wave of rebellion rolled steadily\r\nnorthward. Still the Government in England did nothing. They had\r\nresolutely ignored the whole Soudan question, and allowed matters to\r\ndrift. Gordon’s urgent advice to occupy Berber with British troops,\r\nin order to keep open the route to Suakin, had been disregarded, and\r\nhis demand for Zobehr Pasha to be sent to Khartoum, as the only\r\nchance of saving the situation, was emphatically refused. It was not\r\ntill August, that the British Cabinet recognised that some effort\r\nmight be required to relieve Khartoum, and even to defend Lower Egypt\r\nfrom the Mahdi. By the middle of August preparations were made for\r\ndispatching a small body of troops to Wady Halfa, and a squadron of\r\nthe 19th Hussars was held in readiness. Then followed more delay. It\r\nwas not till the middle of September that preparations for an advance\r\nbeyond Wady Halfa began to be made in earnest.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th October, three squadrons of the regiment, under Lieut.\r\nColonel Barrow, left Cairo, and reached Wady Halfa, by rail and\r\nsteamer, on 12th November, with a total strength of 21 officers, and\r\n353 Non-Commissioned officers and men. Two instances of the eager\r\nspirit to get to the front, that animated the whole regiment, must\r\nnot go unrecorded. At the moment of leaving the barracks in Cairo,\r\na man met with an accident that necessitated his being left behind.\r\nIn a minute one of the men detailed to remain at Cairo stepped\r\nforward in his place, in marching order, with kit complete. He had\r\ngot himself ready on the chance of some such opportunity occurring,\r\nand it is pleasant to know that he got it. At Assiout, next morning,\r\na stowaway was discovered, a bandboy, who accounted for himself by\r\nsaying “He was the only _man_ in the band without a medal, and he\r\ncould not stand it.”\r\n\r\nExperience had shown that English horses could not stand hard work\r\nunder a tropical sun, with scarcity of water and desert fare. It\r\nwas therefore decided, before leaving Cairo, to mount the regiment\r\nentirely on the small Syrian Arab horses used by the Egyptian\r\ncavalry. Three hundred and fifty of these little horses had been sent\r\nup in advance, and were taken over by the regiment on arrival at Wady\r\nHalfa. The regiment was at this time in superb condition. The men\r\nhad an average of seven years’ service, and most of them had been\r\nthrough the preceding campaigns of Tel-el-Kebir and Suakin. From Wady\r\nHalfa the regiment marched, by squadrons, to Korti, where it arrived\r\non the 20th December.\r\n\r\nHere was assembled the expeditionary force, under General Lord\r\nWolseley; perhaps the most singular force ever put into the field\r\nby Great Britain, to fight in one of the most remarkable campaigns;\r\nstarting from a base a thousand miles from the sea. In addition to\r\nthe 19th Hussars, who were the only horsemen with the force, and\r\nnine battalions of infantry, there were four Camel Corps, composed\r\nrespectively of picked men from different Heavy and Light Cavalry\r\nregiments, the Foot Guards, and Infantry of the Line; a Naval Brigade\r\nof Bluejackets and Marines; a Battery of Royal Artillery, and two\r\nCamel Batteries. The boats by which the Nile had been ascended had\r\nbeen built in England, and were managed by Canadian voyageurs, some\r\nof whom were of Indian blood, and by Kroomen from the west coast of\r\nAfrica, while the camels were managed by Arab drivers brought for the\r\npurpose from Aden.\r\n\r\nThe original intention had been to follow the course of the river the\r\nwhole way to Khartoum, but now a fresh disposition became necessary.\r\nA letter from Gordon, dated 4th November, was received, showing that\r\nprovisions in Khartoum were running short, and time would not allow\r\nof the slow but less hazardous advance along the river. The new plan\r\nwas to send a compact flying column across the desert to Metemmeh,\r\nunder Brigadier General Sir Herbert Stewart, for the purpose of\r\nopening communication with Khartoum. A second column, under Major\r\nGeneral W. Earle, was to ascend the river, clearing away all parties\r\nof the enemy, and, eventually, to recapture Berber. The rest of the\r\nforce was to remain at Korti, where Lord Wolseley’s Head Quarters\r\nwere fixed. The 19th Hussars were destined to furnish a contingent to\r\nboth columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DESERT COLUMN\r\n\r\nThe task before the Desert Column was no easy one. Between Korti\r\nand Metemmeh 176 miles of barren desert have to be traversed. At\r\ntwo places only is water in any considerable quantity procurable;\r\nat Jakdul 98 miles from Korti, and at Abu Klea, about 53 miles from\r\nJakdul. The first operation was to establish a post at Jakdul, where\r\nas yet the enemy had not appeared.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th December, a force of 1107 men of all ranks, with 2200\r\ncamels, started from Korti, under Sir Herbert Stewart. With them went\r\n2 officers and 32 men of the 19th. Being the only horsemen with the\r\nforce, the whole of the scouting duties devolved upon the men of the\r\n19th. The rest of the force were mounted on camels. One gallon of\r\nwater for each man, and two for each horse, were carried on camels.\r\nIn the early morning of the 2nd January, the Jakdul wells were\r\nreached, in 63 hours after leaving Korti. Only a few stragglers of\r\nthe enemy were sighted. On the same evening the force set out on its\r\nreturn to Korti, leaving a garrison of 420 men at Jakdul.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th January, Sir Herbert Stewart again started with the main\r\ncolumn, consisting of 1607 men, 2228 camels, and 306 camel drivers.\r\nThe 19th Hussars, on this occasion, mustered 135 officers and men,\r\nwith 155 horses, under Lieut. Colonel Barrow. On the 14th, the column\r\nleft Jakdul: about 1800 combatants of all ranks, with 1118 camels.\r\nEarly on the 16th, the 19th were pushed on ahead of the column,\r\nand came in touch with the enemy in front of the Abu Klea wells. A\r\npatrol, under Major French, pursued a small body of men right into\r\nthe gorge leading to the wells, and captured one of them, on the spot\r\nwhere next day’s action was fought. A number of horsemen appearing\r\nand threatening to cut him off, French was obliged to relinquish\r\nhis prisoner, and retire to the entrance of the gorge. Here Barrow\r\ndismounted his men in order to keep the road open for Stewart’s\r\nforce. Though threatened on both flanks by the enemy’s horsemen, the\r\nposition was easily held by carbine fire, and the power of the enemy\r\nto dispute the advance of the column at this point was checkmated.\r\nOn the arrival of the column a zeriba was formed for the night,\r\nthree and a half miles from the water. As the camp was being formed,\r\nthe enemy appeared in considerable numbers, and opened a distant\r\nfire, wounding one man and several horses of the 19th. As darkness\r\nclosed in the enemy became bolder, and, during the whole night, the\r\nforce was exposed to a constant fire which did little harm beyond\r\ndisturbing the much needed rest of the men. At daybreak, the fire\r\nincreased in intensity; several officers and men were struck down,\r\nand the 19th had several horses killed and disabled while standing at\r\ntheir pickets. At 9 A.M. the force was formed in square, preparatory\r\nto an advance towards the water which was of such vital importance.\r\nWhile the square was forming, the 19th were ordered to move out and\r\nhold in check a body of some 500 of the enemy, horsemen and footmen\r\ncombined, who threatened to get round to the rear of the square.\r\nAn hour after the hussars had left, the square advanced. The small\r\nforce moved slowly, frequent halts being necessary to permit of the\r\ncamels, loaded with ammunition and water, closing up. The ground was\r\nuneven, with ravines and hollows that prevented the full strength of\r\nthe enemy being seen. Suddenly a great body of Arabs, 5000 strong,\r\nrose from a fold in the ground, and rushed at the square. So rapid\r\nand overwhelming was their attack, aided by the inequalities of the\r\nground, and the fact that the fire from the square was at first\r\nimpeded by its own retiring skirmishers that, in spite of the heavy\r\nfire poured upon them, the Arabs succeeded in penetrating the square,\r\nas at Tamai, stabbing and slashing in every direction. At the same\r\nmoment, a squadron of horsemen charged the square, but were repulsed.\r\nFor five minutes the hand-to-hand conflict raged, till the last Arab\r\nwho penetrated the formation was killed. The remainder, who had been\r\nheavily punished by rifle and artillery fire drew off, though for\r\na time it seemed doubtful if they would not renew the attack. The\r\n19th, who had helped the square with dismounted fire, followed and\r\ncut off many stragglers, but the number of the enemy was too great\r\nto admit of a charge on the main body. The horses also were hardly\r\nable to move out of a walk, having been thirty hours without water.\r\nIn this brief conflict the small British force lost 74 killed, and 94\r\nwounded, some of whom died of their injuries. As at El Teb and Tamai,\r\nthe fatal skill with which the Arabs used their weapons is shown\r\nby the relative numbers of killed and wounded. Of the Arabs, whose\r\nstrength was estimated at about 9000 men, 1100 dead were counted in\r\nclose proximity to the square.\r\n\r\nOn the retreat of the enemy, Barrow pushed on and occupied the wells,\r\nfrom which the enemy had to be driven by carbine fire. It was late at\r\nnight before the infantry obtained the much needed water.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the 18th was spent in building a small fort at\r\nAbu Klea, and establishing a post there, for the protection of the\r\nwounded and defence of the wells. While this was in progress, the\r\n19th returned to the battle field and buried the British dead. Late\r\nin the afternoon the small column moved out, to traverse the 25 miles\r\nof desert that must be crossed before the Nile could be reached. The\r\n19th Hussars led the way. As night closed in, progress became very\r\nslow. Men and camels were exhausted, and, in the darkness, great\r\nconfusion ensued. Night marching over an unknown route is a doubtful\r\nexpedient. In the early morning of the 19th, the line of the Nile,\r\nwith villages, was sighted about six miles distant. But between\r\nthem and the column was a gravel ridge on which the enemy appeared,\r\nand soon, dense masses of them were visible, swarming out to meet\r\nthe column. In view of the distress for want of water, it had been\r\nSir Herbert Stewart’s wish to reach the Nile without fighting; but\r\nthis was now impossible. The camels were collected together, and a\r\nzeriba of brushwood, saddles, boxes &c. formed. By 8 o’clock the\r\nenemy’s fire became heavy. Among the earliest to be struck was the\r\ncommander of the column, Sir Herbert Stewart, who received a wound\r\nthat afterwards proved mortal. Speaking to Colonel Barrow just before\r\nhe received the fatal wound, he said, “Take care of the 19th Hussars,\r\nthey have done well.” The command devolved on Colonel Sir Charles\r\nWilson. It was necessary to drive the enemy away, but nothing could\r\nbe done till the zeriba was complete, and, owing to the exhaustion of\r\nthe men, the work proceeded slowly. In the interval there were many\r\ncasualties, and here the 19th Hussars lost Quarter Master A. G. Lima,\r\nwho was killed by a shot through the head.\r\n\r\nAt last all was ready. The 19th Hussars came in, and picketted their\r\nhorses, which were so exhausted as to be scarcely able to carry the\r\nmen. Colonel Barrow and his men were detailed to assist in holding\r\nthe zeriba, while the rest of the force marched out to engage the\r\nenemy. By 2 o’clock the square had formed up outside the zeriba,\r\nand moved off. With it went a few dismounted men of the 19th, under\r\nLieutenant Craven.\r\n\r\nAs the square moved towards the Nile, the enemy’s fire increased,\r\nand many men fell. The progress made was very slow. The bush and\r\nsandhills on three sides swarmed with Arabs. As the square neared the\r\nridge, the men dropped fast under the heavy rifle fire to which they\r\nwere exposed. Suddenly the enemy’s fire ceased, and a great swarm of\r\nArabs poured down on the square. There were no skirmishers to mask\r\nthe fire, as at Abu Klea, and the Arabs were met by a steady fire\r\nthat swept away the foremost ranks wholesale. Not an Arab lived to\r\nreach the square, and a ringing British cheer went up as the enemy\r\nwere seen to be flying in all directions. The way to the Nile was no\r\nlonger closed. Half an hour after dark the river was reached, near\r\nthe village of Abu Krou. It was not till the afternoon of the 20th\r\nthat the 19th Hussar horses were able to drink. Half of them had been\r\n72 hours without water; none of them less than 56 hours, yet only\r\n3 succumbed. If English horses had been employed, probably not one\r\nwould have survived.\r\n\r\n  “The cavalry horses were quite done up. The way in which Barrow\r\n  managed to bring the 19th Hussars across the desert is one of\r\n  the best things in the expedition; but the horses had only had\r\n  a short drink at Abu Klea, and then they had barely enough to\r\n  wash their mouths out until they got to the Nile on the 20th. The\r\n  scouting of the Hussars during the march was admirably done; they\r\n  were ubiquitous. But want of food and water no horses can fight\r\n  against, and they were but a sorry spectacle as they moved out of\r\n  the zeriba to go down to the river. They reached the Nile almost\r\n  useless as cavalry, and could only be employed for scouting\r\n  purposes, at short distances from the camp.”[72]\r\n\r\nDuring the whole march from Korti the entire scouting duty had been\r\ntaken by the 19th Hussars, so that, each day, they covered far more\r\nground than the rest of the force. The men also were thoroughly\r\nexhausted with the tremendous efforts they had been called on to\r\nmake, but their health continued to be good. There was wonderful\r\nfreedom from sickness of any kind. The casualties in the whole force\r\non the 19th January, amounted to 1 officer and 22 non-commissioned\r\nofficers and men killed; 8 officers and 90 non-commissioned officers\r\nand men wounded. Many non-combatants also were killed or wounded.\r\n\r\nThe 20th was occupied in placing the village of Gubat in a state of\r\ndefence, and, at dawn of the 21st, Barrow and his Hussars rode out to\r\nreconnoitre Metemmeh, preparatory to an attack in force. So exhausted\r\nwere the horses that all the Hussars could do was to ride up in a\r\nbody to some high ground on the north of the village, while the rest\r\nof the force opened fire from the east side. While the attack was\r\nproceeding, four small steamers sent down by Gordon from Khartoum on\r\nthe 14th December, appeared in sight, and landed some native troops.\r\nThey brought intelligence of Arab reinforcements being on the march\r\nfrom Khartoum. It was important to husband ammunition, and incur no\r\nfurther losses of men, so the attack was withdrawn. But the Arab\r\nreinforcements never reached Metemmeh. The news of the disastrous\r\ndefeats their comrades had sustained at Abu Klea and Abu Krou, caused\r\nthem to retrace their steps.\r\n\r\nReconnoissances having shown that no large force of the enemy was in\r\nthe vicinity, Sir Charles Wilson started on the 24th for Khartoum,\r\nwith two of the steamers, taking with him two hundred men. On the\r\n28th, after great difficulties, Khartoum was reached, and found to\r\nbe in the hands of the Arabs. The town had been captured by the\r\nMahdi, two days before, and Gordon was dead. On the 4th February,\r\nSir Charles Wilson and his party rejoined the camp at Gubat, after\r\nadventures that read more like a page of romance than of modern\r\nhistory. In the interval, both his steamers had been wrecked, and\r\nthe whole party had been continuously under fire for eight days\r\nand a half. In the meantime, the force at Gubat received some\r\nreinforcements and supplies from Korti. The 19th were engaged in\r\ndaily skirmishes with the outlying pickets of the enemy who showed\r\na wholesome respect for them: “Even the fierce Baggara horsemen\r\nappeared unwilling to cross swords with our Hussars,” wrote one who\r\nwas present with the force. On the 11th, Major General Sir Redvers\r\nBuller arrived to take command of the force, with orders to retire on\r\nAbu Klea.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th February, Gubat was evacuated, and Abu Klea reached on\r\nthe 15th, followed by the enemy who annoyed the force with long range\r\nrifle fire. At Abu Klea, on the 17th, a smart skirmish took place\r\nwhich cost the force 3 killed and 27 wounded. Among the killed was\r\nSergeant Horwood of the 19th Hussars, who was acting as Sergeant\r\nMajor with the Mounted Infantry. It had been intended to occupy\r\nAbu Klea permanently, in view of a second advance on Khartoum in\r\nthe autumn; but want of food, scarcity of water, and the complete\r\nbreakdown of transport necessitated Buller’s withdrawal to Korti. On\r\nthe 16th, the 19th Hussars marched out for Jakdul, leaving at Abu\r\nKlea with Sir R. Buller a small detachment under Major French. The\r\nmarch was a painful one, about half the men being on foot. While on\r\nthe march they heard of Sir Herbert Stewart’s death near Jakdul.\r\nWishing to be present at the funeral of the commander they had\r\nserved under in two campaigns, they made a long forced march into\r\nJakdul, but arrived too late. They had the melancholy satisfaction\r\nof erecting a walled enclosure, with headstone, round his grave. On\r\nthe 3rd March they left Jakdul, and reached Korti on the 8th. On\r\nthe 23rd February the last of the desert column left Abu Klea, and\r\nreturned to Korti, 16th March. In a dispatch from Jakdul, dated 26th\r\nFebruary, Sir R. Buller wrote of the 19th Hussars:--\r\n\r\n  “I wish expressly to remark on the very excellent work done\r\n  by the small detachment of the 19th Hussars, both during our\r\n  occupation of Abu Klea and during our retirement. Each man has\r\n  done the work of ten, and it is not too much to say that the\r\n  force owes much to Major French and his 13 troopers.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the men of the 19th, left at Korti, had not been idle. In\r\nFebruary they were engaged in establishing two watering posts in the\r\ndesert, distant respectively twelve and thirty miles from Korti, for\r\nthe use of the retiring force. The water was conveyed in tin lined\r\nbiscuit boxes, and every animal in camp was pressed into the service.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIVER COLUMN\r\n\r\nThe primary object of General Earle’s column was to clear the river\r\nline of all hostile parties as far as Abu Hamed, punishing, _en\r\nroute_, the Monassir tribe of Arabs who had treacherously murdered\r\nColonel Stewart and a small party sent down by Gordon from Khartoum,\r\nin September. At Abu Hamed a base was to be established for a further\r\nadvance on Berber. The force, under General Earle, consisted of four\r\nbattalions of infantry, a battery of Egyptian Artillery, an Egyptian\r\nCamel Corps, and one squadron of the 19th Hussars; the latter under\r\nMajor Hanford-Flood, amounting to 91 sabres and 107 horses. The total\r\nstrength of the force was about 3000 officers and men.\r\n\r\nThe force left Korti, in detachments, for Hamdab, about 50 miles\r\nup the river, whence the final start was to be made. On the 18th\r\nJanuary, 60 men of the 19th Hussars together with the Egyptian Camel\r\nCorps, under Major Flood, made a forced march into the desert to\r\nsurprise a party of the enemy collected at the wells of El Kooa, 35\r\nmiles from Hamdab. The Arabs having received timely notice of their\r\ncoming, hastily broke up their camp and disappeared, before Flood’s\r\narrival. The detachment returned to Hamdab after 32 hours’ absence.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th, the start was made; the Hussars, Camel Corps and\r\nbaggage, marching along the left bank, the infantry and stores in\r\nboats. Progress was very slow, the banks of the river being rough\r\nand difficult, and the frequent rapids and cataracts causing great\r\nlabour in tracking the boats up. On the 27th, the cavalry skirmishers\r\nfirst came in touch with the enemy, but beyond a harmless interchange\r\nof shots at long range nothing occurred. This happened frequently,\r\nthe enemy falling back, day by day, as the river column advanced.\r\nThe progress of the boats was very slow owing to the succession of\r\nrapids here formed by the Nile. Major Flood’s men worked and camped\r\nindependently, reconnoitring along the left bank, far ahead of the\r\nmain body, and, owing to the rocky nature of the ground, often at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the river. The rocky ridge, on which the\r\nbattle of Kirbekan was afterwards fought, was ascended and mapped,\r\nand a reconnoissance of the 19th Hussars was pushed some way into the\r\nShukook Pass, five days before the action. On the 6th February, a two\r\ndays’ halt at Birti became necessary, in consequence of the fall of\r\nKhartoum making a change of plans possible. The enemy meanwhile had\r\nfallen back to the Shukook Pass.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th, the advance was resumed, and it became known that the\r\nenemy, about 1000 strong, had advanced from the Shukook Pass, and\r\ntaken position in some extremely strong ground at Kirbekan, in front\r\nof the Pass, about 14 miles from Earle’s Head Quarters. The 8th\r\nand 9th were employed in reconnoitring, and closing up the troops\r\npreparatory to the attack. On the 8th, Major Flood, with twenty of\r\nhis men, exchanged volleys with the enemy, and drove in some of their\r\nadvanced posts. On the 9th, the whole of the mounted troops felt\r\nthe enemy again. That night the troops bivouacked in their allotted\r\nstations, the most advanced of the infantry being only a short mile\r\nfrom the enemy’s position.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 10th, General Earle, with 1196 men of all\r\nranks, moved forward to the attack. The enemy occupied a position\r\non a line of low rocky eminences at right angles to the river, and\r\na detached steep ridge in echelon with the rocky eminences. It was\r\ndetermined to march right round the rear of their position by the\r\ndesert side, closing their retreat, and attack them in flank and rear\r\nfrom the river side. Two companies of the Staffordshire regiment,\r\nwith two guns were left in front of the position to occupy the\r\nenemy’s attention, and keep down their fire. The 19th Hussars led the\r\nway, and the force marched right round the enemy’s position till the\r\nriver was again reached in the enemy’s right rear. As soon as they\r\nsaw their retreat was cut off, a number of the enemy tried to escape\r\nby swimming the river, many of them being shot in the attempt. But a\r\nconsiderable number of them still held their ground. The Black Watch\r\nwere accordingly ordered to assault the line of rocky eminences,\r\nwhile the Staffordshire regiment assaulted the ridge. As the Black\r\nWatch won their way along the lower eminences, a desperate rush was\r\nmade by a body of the enemy, which was repulsed, and the eminences\r\ncrowned by the Highlanders; the Arabs gallantly fighting to the last\r\nman. In the moment of victory, General Earle was killed by a shot\r\nfrom a hut which he had incautiously approached. The assault on the\r\nhigh steep ridge offered greater difficulties, but the position was\r\ngallantly carried by the Staffordshire men. Both regiments had their\r\ncommanding officers killed.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Flood’s Hussars and the Egyptian Camel Corps had\r\ngained the entrance to the Shukook Pass, and captured one of the\r\nenemy’s camps, in which were a number of standards, camels and\r\ndonkeys. The enemy opened fire from the surrounding hills without\r\neffect. The victory was purchased with the loss of three officers\r\nand nine men killed, four officers and forty-four men wounded. The\r\nenemy’s force was subsequently ascertained to have been from fifteen\r\nhundred to two thousand men, but of these only about six hundred\r\nfought well.\r\n\r\nThe advance of the column was continued, on the 12th, under Colonel\r\nH. Brackenbury, on whom the command had devolved by General Earle’s\r\ndeath. The enemy had disappeared, but progress was slow, through\r\nthe continuous rapids. On the 20th, a suitable place was found for\r\ncrossing the Nile. A scouting party of the 19th was first rowed\r\nacross, and brushed away some of the enemy’s scouts. By the afternoon\r\nof the 21st, the whole force was transported to the right bank, at\r\nHebbeh, the scene of Colonel Stewart’s murder in September. The\r\nmurderers had fled, and beyond the destruction of their property no\r\nother punishment could be meted out to them. By the evening of the\r\n23rd, the whole force was concentrated at Huella, 26 miles from Abu\r\nHamed.\r\n\r\nAll was ready for the advance on Abu Hamed, where a strong force of\r\nthe enemy was known to be posted. Hardly had the troops commenced\r\ntheir march, on the 24th, when orders were received from Korti\r\ndirecting their return to Merawi. Sir Redvers Buller’s withdrawal\r\nfrom Abu Klea rendered a farther advance on Berber out of the\r\nquestion, and the River Column had to return. While the main body\r\ncommenced to descend the river, Major Flood’s squadron scouted\r\nanother six miles towards Abu Hamed, without seeing an enemy.\r\nDescending by the right bank, Merawi was reached on the 5th March,\r\nand, on the 6th, after recrossing the river to Abu Dom, the River\r\nColumn was broken up. One troop of the 19th was left at Abu Dom,\r\nwhile the remainder marched for Korti.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the extremely hard work, the health of the troops, as\r\nwith the Desert Column, had been excellent. Not a single man of Major\r\nFlood’s party had been on the sick list, from the time of leaving\r\nKorti till the date of return. Of the horses, three had succumbed.\r\nThe performance of the small Arab horses both with the River and\r\nDesert Columns, carrying a heavy weight, on scanty fare and less\r\nwater, is a marvel of endurance.\r\n\r\nThe next few days were spent in arranging for the distribution of\r\nthe troops into summer quarters, in anticipation of the advance on\r\nKhartoum in the autumn. The quarters selected for the 19th were\r\nMerawi, Abu Dom, Tani, Kurot, Abu Kussi, and Dongola. By the 1st\r\nApril, they were all located in the assigned positions. Before\r\nleaving Korti, the regiment was inspected by Lord Wolseley, who\r\naddressed them in terms of commendation that will long be remembered\r\nin the regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS NEAR SUAKIN\r\n\r\nWhile their comrades had thus been busy on the Nile, the remnant\r\nof the regiment left at Cairo had found work to do. The effect\r\nof the operations, near Suakin, in March 1884, had been quite\r\ntemporary. Osman Digna had recovered his authority, and was again\r\nthreatening the port. It was also considered that, by making a\r\ndiversion at Suakin, the operations near Berber and the reopening\r\nof the Suakin-Berber road would be facilitated. It was determined,\r\ntherefore, to send a sufficient force to crush Osman Digna, and to\r\nmake a railway line to Berber. The capture of Berber, before the\r\ngreat heat of the summer set in, was then considered feasible.\r\n\r\nBefore the force, which was to be commanded by Lieut. General Sir\r\nGerald Graham, could arrive, a weak squadron of the 19th Hussars,\r\nunder Captain Apthorp, was dispatched from Cairo on the 24th January,\r\ntogether with two Horse Artillery guns, followed next day by a\r\nbattalion of infantry. On landing at Suakin, reconnoissances were\r\ninstituted to ascertain the strength and position of the enemy. On\r\nthe 1st February, a small force of all arms reconnoitred, under Major\r\nGeneral Fremantle, towards Hasheem, 8 miles west of Suakin. The Arabs\r\nwere found in great numbers, in a position too strong to attack. The\r\ninfantry were formed in square, while the cavalry and guns were sent\r\nforward to try and draw the enemy out of their position. But the\r\nmemory of El-Teb and Tamai were too fresh in the Arab mind for them\r\nto be induced to attack the arrayed infantry. They refused to quit\r\ntheir position, and after a prolonged skirmish, General Fremantle’s\r\nforce returned to camp. One Egyptian trooper was wounded, and the\r\n19th Hussars lost a horse.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd, Captain Apthorp was sent with 40 of his own men and 40\r\nEgyptian troopers to reconnoitre along the Berber road. At Hamdoob,\r\n10 miles from Suakin, a camp and village, occupied by the enemy, was\r\nsurprised and burnt. While the small party were thus occupied, a\r\ngreat body of Arabs, 5000 strong, had moved from Tamai and Hasheem\r\nto intercept them, and took post in a ravine two miles from Hamdoob,\r\ncompletely blocking their return to Suakin. The Arab force was so\r\nwell concealed that the squadron was almost in contact with them\r\nbefore their presence was discovered, and the great mass of Arabs,\r\nfootmen and men mounted on camels, bore down on the small body of\r\ncavalry at once. There was no time to dismount and fire, and it was\r\nhopeless to attempt to break through: nothing was left them but to\r\nride for Suakin by a circuitous route. Turning eastwards the squadron\r\nstarted on a long gallop round the enemy’s flank. The Arabs followed\r\nin overwhelming numbers, and, moving on a shorter line, together with\r\ntheir knowledge of the ground, were able to harass the squadron for\r\nseveral miles. The 19th lost 8 men and 11 horses, while the Egyptian\r\ntroop lost three men and six horses.\r\n\r\nThe number of Arabs in the neighbourhood of Suakin was too great to\r\nallow of distant reconnoissances, little more of interest occurred,\r\ntherefore, till the arrival of Sir Gerald Graham’s force. Early in\r\nMarch, they began to arrive, but the whole force was not completed\r\ntill nearly the middle of April. On the 17th March, the 19th Hussar\r\nsquadron re-embarked for Cairo in order to join the Head Quarters of\r\nthe regiment at Dongola, in readiness for the advance on Khartoum in\r\nthe autumn.\r\n\r\nOur interest with the Suakin force ceases here. It is sufficient\r\nto say that it amounted to 12,500 men, composed of troops from\r\nEngland, a contingent of native troops from India, and a contingent\r\nfrom New South Wales consisting of two batteries of artillery, and\r\n500 infantry. It had also with it a balloon detachment, the first\r\noccasion on which balloons were used by British troops in warfare.\r\nOn the 20th March, it fought a successful action at Hasheem, and\r\nagain on the 22nd, at Tofrik, when an enormous number of the enemy\r\nwere killed at a rather heavy cost to the British troops engaged. On\r\nthe 3rd April, Tamai was occupied, and the last of the enemy’s force\r\nbroken up. By the end of April, 18 miles of railway were completed,\r\nand the tribes in the neighbourhood had given in their submission;\r\nwhen the intention of the British Government to abandon the advance\r\non Khartoum became known. On the 17th May, the withdrawal of the\r\ntroops commenced, and again Suakin was left with only a small force\r\nto protect the port.\r\n\r\nWe left the three squadrons of the 19th at Dongola and other stations\r\nsouth of that place, with all thoughts concentrated on preparations\r\nfor the autumn advance on Khartoum. The regimental establishment\r\nwas increased by 110 men, bringing up the strength to 740 sabres.\r\nFour strong squadrons were being prepared for the field: but over\r\n13 years were to elapse before Khartoum was again seen by British\r\ntroops. About the 22nd April it was announced that the intention\r\nof advancing on Khartoum in the autumn had been abandoned, and\r\norders were issued for the withdrawal of the troops. The retirement\r\ncommenced on the 26th May, when Merawi was evacuated. The troops were\r\nwithdrawn down the river in detachments, each post being evacuated\r\nin turn as it became the southernmost point of occupation. On the\r\n22nd June, the Head Quarters of the 19th marched out of Dongola, the\r\nlast of the force to leave for Lower Egypt. At Wady Halfa the hot\r\nand tedious march came to an end, and from that point the regiment\r\nreached the railway at Assiout in barges. At Wady Halfa, Korosko and\r\nAssouan they made over their horses to the 20th Hussars, and, by\r\nthe 14th August, the regiment was reunited in Cairo. In the whole\r\ncampaign the regiment had suffered a total loss of two officers,\r\nLt. Colonel Taylor (died of fever) and Quarter Master Lima, and 18\r\nnon-commissioned officers and men.\r\n\r\nIn July 1885, Her Majesty was graciously pleased to confer on the\r\nregiment the designation of “Princess of Wales’ Own,” in recognition\r\nof “its distinguished services in Egypt and the Soudan.”\r\n\r\nBy G.O. 10 of January 1886 the regiment was permitted to bear on its\r\nappointments, the words “Nile 1884-85” “Abu Klea,” in commemoration\r\nof the ascent of the river Nile and the operations in the Eastern\r\nSoudan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLONEL PERCY BARROW, C.B.\r\n\r\n  _From a Photograph._]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1886, the regiment experienced a severe loss\r\nin the death of its commander, Colonel Percy Barrow. The desperate\r\nwound he had received at El Teb, on the 19th February 1884, was\r\none from which complete recovery was impossible. In spite of grave\r\ninconvenience to himself, he had gone through the most arduous part\r\nof the Nile campaign without flinching, while the skill and judgment\r\nwith which he handled his men during the march of the Desert Column\r\nwon the applause of the whole force. While preparing the regiment\r\nfor some regimental games, a violent exertion re-opened the old\r\nwound, and after thirty hours of intense suffering he expired on the\r\n13th January, in his 38th year. In him the army lost a soldier of\r\ngreat promise. The son of a well known Indian Officer, Major General\r\nLousada Barrow, who commanded a Corps of Volunteer Cavalry in the\r\nIndian Mutiny and at the relief of Lucknow, Percy Barrow entered the\r\n19th Hussars as Cornet in 1868. In 1879, he was selected to command a\r\ncorps of Mounted Infantry and some irregular troops in the Zulu war;\r\nand served through the Boer war of 1881 in command of the Mounted\r\nInfantry. The soldierly spirit that animated him, and his intense\r\ndevotion to everything that concerned the welfare of the regiment,\r\ncan only be appreciated by those who have been privileged to read his\r\nletters written in quarters and in the field. Telegrams of condolence\r\nto the regiment from Her Majesty the Queen and from Her Royal\r\nHighness the Princess of Wales testified to the general appreciation\r\nof the loss the public service had suffered in his death. His remains\r\nwere removed to England and interred at Saltwood near Hythe. To\r\ncommand the regiment, his brother-in-law, Colonel Boyce Combe, was\r\ntransferred from the 10th Hussars to the 19th.\r\n\r\nIn May, the regiment was ordered to proceed to England, and embarked\r\nat Alexandria on the 19th, in the _Geelong_ and the _Iona_, leaving\r\ntheir horses behind them. On the 6th and 7th June, they landed at\r\nHarwich and Woolwich, and proceeded to Norwich, three troops being\r\nsent to Colchester. The regiment was much gratified at the receipt,\r\non landing, of a telegram, welcoming them to England, from H.R.H. the\r\nPrincess of Wales. In July, one of the Colchester troops was recalled\r\nto Head Quarters. The establishment of the regiment was fixed at 24\r\nofficers, 469 warrant officers non-commissioned officers and men, and\r\n300 horses.\r\n\r\nIn the following March, the two troops at Colchester were sent to\r\nBirmingham, being replaced, in September, at Colchester by two troops\r\nfrom Head Quarters.\r\n\r\nIn October, the establishment was increased by 132 rank and file and\r\n80 horses. For this purpose the necessary horses were transferred to\r\nthe regiment from the 14th and 21st Hussars. A month later, by which\r\ntime 56 recruits had been enlisted, the order was cancelled, and the\r\nhorses were transferred to the 18th and 20th Hussars. At the end of\r\nthe year, the Colchester squadron rejoined Head Quarters.\r\n\r\nIn April 1888, the regiment marched from Norwich and Birmingham to\r\nHounslow, Hampton Court and Kensington.\r\n\r\nIn September, the regiment was brought on the strength of the 1st\r\nArmy Corps, and its establishment increased to 707 of all ranks with\r\n424 horses.\r\n\r\nIn March 1889, under Army Order No. 136, the regiment was granted\r\npermission to wear “Mysore” on its appointments, in commemoration of\r\nthe campaigns against Tippoo in the last century, in which the old\r\n19th Light Dragoons had borne so distinguished a part. The badge is\r\ncertainly more appropriate than the old one of “Seringapatam” which\r\nwas discarded.\r\n\r\nIn the same month the regiment lost its Colonel, Major General John\r\nYorke, C.B. In his place Major General and Honorary Lieut. General\r\nCoote Synge Hutchinson was gazetted to the regiment. He was an old\r\n2nd Dragoon Guards’ officer, and had served with that regiment\r\nthrough the Indian Mutiny.\r\n\r\nIn the following June, the regiment marched to Aldershot. On the 3rd\r\nJuly, it was employed in London on the occasion of H.M. the Shah of\r\nPersia visiting the City.\r\n\r\nIn September 1890, the regiment took part in the manœuvres on\r\nBerkshire Downs.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th June 1891, a special inspection of the regiment was held\r\nby H.R.H. the Princess of Wales; and, on the 8th July, the 19th took\r\npart in a review at Hounslow before H.I.M. the German Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe regiment was again destined for foreign service. At the end of\r\nJuly, it marched to Shorncliffe, and, on 1st September, embarked at\r\nPortsmouth, in the _Euphrates_, for India, arriving at Bombay on the\r\n28th, whence it was forwarded by train to Secunderabad in relief of\r\nthe 7th Hussars. In November the regiment was transferred, by train,\r\nto Bangalore.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1892 the squadron system was substituted for the\r\ntroop system in the regiment.\r\n\r\nIn October 1896, the 19th P.W.O. Hussars were transferred to\r\nSecunderabad. Here we must take leave of the regiment. The history\r\nof a regiment in quarters possesses little interest. “Soldiers in\r\npeace are like chimneys in summer.” When the time comes for the 19th\r\nP.W.O. Hussars to take the field again, they will be found like their\r\npredecessors, over one hundred years ago, “ready in all that depends\r\nupon them, and willing beyond description.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\nYEARLY LISTS OF THE OFFICERS OF THE NINETEENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +--------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+\r\n  |              |       1760       |        1761      |        1762      |\r\n  +--------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+\r\n  |              |                  |                  |                  |\r\n  |_Lieut.Colonel|Charles, _Earl of_|Charles, _Earl of_|Charles, _Earl of_|\r\n  |  Commandant_ |  Drogheda.       |  Drogheda.       |  Drogheda.       |\r\n  |              |                  |                  |                  |\r\n  |_Lieut.       | John Wynne.      | John Wynne.      | Richard Gorges.  |\r\n  |  Colonel_    |                  |                  |                  |\r\n  |              |                  |                  |                  |\r\n  |_Major_       | Wm.

From the commencement of\r\nthe campaign, no other regiment has done more valuable service,\r\nor displayed greater dash and daring, than the 19th Hussars,\r\nespecially on the 29th February.

As a cavalry officer I had not the chance\r\nto notice each act of bravery as others had, but the conduct of the\r\nregiment, and its steadiness and boldness were noticed by several\r\nInfantry Officers who were better able to see and judge than I, and\r\nwho have spoken to me in the highest possible terms of the way in\r\nwhich it discharged its difficult duties.\r\n\r\n“Your loss has been heavy, but your victory has been sure. I mourn\r\nthe fate of my comrades in arms, and of your second in command Lieut.\r\nColonel Barrow.\r\n\r\n“I had heard of your drill, and I proved the efficiency of the\r\nregiment when it was on the Curragh, and its present state of\r\nefficiency is admirable. Words are inadequate to convey to you how\r\nmuch I would wish to thank you, but I do thank you from the bottom of\r\nmy heart.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX G.\r\n\r\n  CASUALTIES IN THE NINETEENTH HUSSARS DURING THE SOUDAN CAMPAIGN\r\n  OF 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nABU KLEA (16th and 17th January).\r\n\r\n  _Killed_--\r\n\r\n      _Corporal_                       J.

The late Genl. Sir H. Stewart told me,\r\nafter the campaign of 1884 in the Eastern Soudan, of the good work\r\nyou did there, and said that there was no regiment of cavalry in\r\nHer Majesty’s Service which knew its work more thoroughly, or could\r\nhave performed it better than the 19th Hussars, and that you were\r\neverything a Hussar regiment should be.\r\n\r\n“He was no bad judge, and I know you will value what he said.\r\n\r\n“I for my part have heard this opinion confirmed on all sides, during\r\nthe campaign, and, from what I have personally seen of you, I believe\r\nit to be true. Your success is due not only to the Officers and\r\nNon-Commissioned Officers, who have taught you, and who lead you, but\r\nto the Private Soldiers, each one of whom knows his work as a Cavalry\r\nSoldier, and does his duty so thoroughly.\r\n\r\n“This is of the highest importance in a Light Cavalry Regiment, and\r\nyou have proved its value. You have several months of hot weather in\r\nfront of you, but I know you will face it cheerfully, as your duty;\r\nand I hope that you will keep well, so that when the autumn comes,\r\nand we advance on Khartoum, I may see the 19th Hussars leading the\r\nway, and giving a good account of the enemy, as they have done before.\r\n\r\n“I shall have very much pleasure in reporting to H.R.H. the Field\r\nMarshal Commanding in Chief what I have told you to-day.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX K.\r\n\r\n  REPORT BY COLONEL BARROW ON THE ARAB HORSES RIDDEN BY THE\r\n  NINETEENTH HUSSARS DURING THE NILE CAMPAIGN OF 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Description of Horse._\r\n\r\nArab stallion. Average height, 14 hands; average age, 8 years to 9\r\nyears; some 15 per cent. over 12 years; bought by Egyptian Government\r\nin Syria and Lower Egypt; average price, 18_l._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Work done previous to Campaign._\r\n\r\nSome 50 per cent. had been through the campaign in the Eastern Soudan\r\nwith the 19th Hussars in February and March 1884, and returned in a\r\nvery exhausted state, and about 10 per cent. had been at Tel-el-Kebir.\r\n\r\nIn June 1884 the whole number were taken by Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nTaylor, with the Egyptian Cavalry, from Cairo to Assouan in barges,\r\nand remained there for two months.\r\n\r\nIn September 1884 they were marched by Major Grenfell from Assouan\r\nto Wady Halfa, 210 miles, and there awaited the arrival of the 19th\r\nHussars. 350 of these ponies were handed over to the 19th Hussars on\r\n13th November 1884, all except some 10 per cent., being in a very\r\nfair marching condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The March up the Nile._\r\n\r\nThe 19th Hussars marched by squadrons from Wady Halfa to Korti,\r\ndistance 360 miles. Average daily march about 16 miles, not including\r\nhalts.\r\n\r\nHalts were made for one day at Absarat, one day at Dongola, and two\r\ndays at Shabadood when crossing the river.\r\n\r\nThe ration was supposed to be 8 lb. of grain, barley or dhourra, and\r\n10 lb. of dhourra stalk; but owing to scarcity of grain, the horses\r\ngenerally received about 6 lb. of grain and 10 lb. of dhourra stalks.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at Korti in very good condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Halt at Korti._\r\n\r\nThe horses remained at Korti from 20th December to 7th January, and\r\nreceived 8 lb. green dhourra stalk daily instead of dry stalk. They\r\nimproved during the halt at Korti.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th December 40 horses proceeded to Jakdul, 100 miles, and\r\nperformed the reconnaissance duties of the column. The march to\r\nJakdul was performed in 63 hours, 15 hours’ rest there, and the\r\nreturn journey in 63 hours. Six horses returned the 100 miles in 46\r\nhours; the last 50 miles in 7½ hours.\r\n\r\nDuring the 141 hours of this march the horses were ridden for 83\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Desert March._\r\n\r\nFrom the 8th to the 19th of January, the 19th Hussars, strength\r\nas below, marched across the desert with General Sir H. Stewart’s\r\nColumn:--\r\n\r\n  Officers          8\r\n  Men             127\r\n  Horses          155\r\n\r\nIn addition, therefore, to one extra horse for each Officer, there\r\nwere 12 spare horses.\r\n\r\nThe following table will show the daily work performed and amount of\r\nfood and water given daily to each horse.\r\n\r\nThe 40 horses referred to in previous paragraph returned to Korti on\r\nthe 5th, and started again on the 8th, as fit as any horses in the\r\ntroop.\r\n\r\nThere was not one casualty out of the 40:--\r\n\r\n  +---------+----------------------+-----+----+----------+--------+------+\r\n  |         |                      |  No. of  |  When    | Amount | Food |\r\n  |  Date.  |   Time of March.     |Hours.    | Watered. |   of   |Grain.|\r\n  |         |                      |    Miles.|          |  Water.|      |\r\n  |---------+----------------------+-----+----+----------+--------+------+\r\n  |         |                      |     |    |          |        |  lb. |\r\n  |Janry.8th| 2p.m. to 6p.m.       |  4  | 16 | ...  ... |   ...  |   6  |\r\n  |         |                      |     |    |          |        |      |\r\n  |  ”  9th | 2.45a.m. to 10a.m.   |  7¼ | 29 | 10.30a.m.| 1½ gal.|   6  |\r\n  |         | 2p.m. to 6p.m.       |  4  | 16 |  6.15p.m.|  ½  ”  |      |\r\n  |         |                      |     |    |          |        |      |\r\n  |  ” 10th | 3a.m. to 9am.        |  6  | 24 | ...  ... |   ...  |   6  |\r\n  |         |12.15p.m. to 4.30p.m. |  4½ | 17 |  4.45p.m.|  ¼ gal.|      |\r\n  |         |                      |     |    |          |        |      |\r\n  |  ” 11th | 3.30a.m. to 12.30p.m.|  9  | 36 | 12.45p.m.|F’ldr’nk|   6  |\r\n  |         |                      |     |    |          |        |      |\r\n  |  ” 12th |  ...    ...    ...   | ... | ...|  9a.m.   |    ”   |   6  |\r\n  |         |12.30p.m. to 4.30p.m. |  4  | 16 |  4.45p.m.|    ”   |      |\r\n  |         |                      |     |    |          |        |      |\r\n  |  ” 13th |  Halt at Gakdul      | ... | ...| 8.30a.m.,|    ”   |   6  |\r\n  |         |                      |     |    |  4.45p.m.|        |      |\r\n  |         |                      |     |    |          |        |      |\r\n  |  ” 14th |  ...    ...    ...   | ... | ...|  6a.m.,  |    ”   |   6  |\r\n  |         |                      |     |    |  1p.m.   |        |      |\r\n  |         | 2.30p.m. to 6.30p.m. |  4  | ...| ...  ... |   ...  |      |\r\n  |         |                      |     |    |          |        |      |\r\n  |  ” 15th | 5a.m to 10a.m.       |  5  | 20 | 10.30a.m.| 1¼ gal.|   5  |\r\n  |         | 1.30p.m. to 6p.m.    |  4½ | 18 | ...  ... |   ...  |      |\r\n  |         |                      |     |    |          |        |      |\r\n  |  ” 16th | 4.30a.m. to 4p.m.    | 11½ | 40 |  6p.m.   |  ½ gal.|   4  |\r\n  |         |                      |     |    |          |        |      |\r\n  |  ” 17th | 8a.m. to 4p.m.       |  8  | 32 |  4p.m.   |  2 gal.|   4  |\r\n  |         |                      |     |    |          |        |      |\r\n  |  ” 18th |  ...    ...    ...   | ... | ...|  7a.m.   |  1 gal.|   3  |\r\n  |         | 4p.m. to 12p.m.      |  8  | 32 | ...  ... |   ...  |  ... |\r\n  |         |                      |     |    |          |        |      |\r\n  |  ” 19th | 12p.m. to 9a.m.      |  9  | 36 | ...  ... |   ...  |   1  |\r\n  |         |  9a.m. to 12 noon    | 21  | ...| ...  ... |   ...  |  ... |\r\n  |         |                      |     |    |          |        |      |\r\n  |  ” 20th | 12 noon to 1p.m.     | 13  | ...| ...  ... |   ...  |  ... |\r\n  |         |  ...    ...    ...   |  1  |  4 |  2p.m.   |F’ldr’nk|  ... |\r\n  +---------+----------------------+-----+----+----------+--------+------+\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above table, that the average forage ration\r\nfor the first 10 days was about 5 lb. to 6 lb. of grain, and 2\r\ngallons of water, the horses performing 31 miles daily, not counting\r\none day’s halt.\r\n\r\nWhen the final advance was made on Matammeh, the horses marched to\r\nthe Nile without having received a drop of water for 55 hours, and\r\nonly 1 lb. of grain. Some 15 to 20 horses received no water for 70\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Halt at Gubat._\r\n\r\nDuring the period, 20th January to 14th February, the horses received\r\nno grain, but were fed on dhourra stalk, or green dhourra stalk,\r\nabout 8 lb. daily; two days before marching they received 6 lb. of\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nThey performed outpost and patrol duty, averaging some 8 miles daily.\r\nUnder the above conditions the horses recovered from the effort made\r\nduring the desert march, but many were in a weak state.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Return to Korti and Dongola._\r\n\r\nThe first 75 miles, the horses performed the whole distance on 4 lb.\r\nof grain and 3 gallons of water, the remainder of the journey water\r\nwas plentiful, and the 8 lb. of grain was supplied. Two marches of\r\nover 40 miles were performed, which shows that the horses were still\r\nable to march. After two weeks’ rest at Korti, the horses marched\r\nstrong and well to Dongola and other stations, receiving plenty of\r\nfood and water, and after two months’ halt they were in quite as good\r\ncondition as when they left Wady Haifa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Return March--Dongola to Wady Haifa._\r\n\r\nOn the return march to Wady Haifa the distance, some 250 miles, was\r\nperformed at the average rate of some 16 miles a day, with one halt\r\nfor two days.\r\n\r\nThe marching was done mostly at night, but the horses were generally\r\nexposed to a hot sun all day, as there was not much shelter for them\r\nunder the palm trees.\r\n\r\nExcept two fractures from kicks, no horses were lost or left on the\r\nline of march.\r\n\r\nThe horses were conveyed from Wady Haifa to Assouan in barges, and\r\nafter two weeks’ rest at Assouan were handed over to the 20th Hussars\r\nin quite as good order as when they left Wady Haifa nine months\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\nThe attached statement gives a list of casualties.\r\n\r\nI think it may be considered a most remarkable circumstance, that out\r\nof 350 horses during nine months on a hard campaign, only 12 died\r\nfrom disease.\r\n\r\nThis result must be attributed to the two facts:--\r\n\r\n  1. That the climate of the Soudan is most suitable for horses.\r\n\r\n  2. That the Syrian horse has a wonderful constitution, and is\r\n  admirably suited for warfare in an eastern climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nThe distance actually marched from point to point, not taking any\r\naccount of reconnaissances, &c., was over 1500 miles.\r\n\r\nThe weight carried was reduced to the minimum, but averaged about\r\n14 stone. The weather during the last four months of the campaign\r\nwas trying. Food was often very limited, and during the desert march\r\nwater very scarce. Under the above conditions, I venture to think\r\nthat the performances of the regiment on the Arab ponies, will\r\ncompare with the performance of any horsemen on record.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Casualty Return of Arab ponies, 19th (Princess of Wales’ Own)\r\n  Hussars, 13th November 1884 to 1st July 1885._\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\n  Killed in action         20\r\n  Destroyed                37\r\n  Drowned                   1\r\n  Missing                   1\r\n  Died                     12\r\n                           --\r\n               Total       71\r\n                          ===\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASE.\r\n\r\n  Bullet wounds            23\r\n  Exhaustion               31\r\n  Fractures                 7\r\n  Paralysis                 1\r\n  Enteritis                 1\r\n  Farcy                     1\r\n  Purpura hæmorrhagica      1\r\n  Rupture of intestine      1\r\n  Rupture of stomach        1\r\n  Saddle gall               1\r\n  Colic spasmodic           1\r\n  Missing                   1\r\n  Drowned                   1\r\n                           --\r\n               Total       71\r\n                          ===\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Casualty Return of Arab Ponies, 19th (Princess of Wales’ Own)\r\n  Hussars, from 13th November 1884, to 1st July 1885, showing the\r\n  period during which the horses died._\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+----------+------------+-------------+--------+\r\n  |       Period.        |Number of |Destroyed or|Destroyed or | Killed |\r\n  |                      | horses   | died from  |  died from  |   in   |\r\n  |                      |effective.|debility and|other causes.| action.|\r\n  |                      |          | exhaustion.|             |        |\r\n  +----------------------+----------+------------+-------------+--------+\r\n  |                      |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |Wady Haifa to Korti,  |    350   |      ...   |       5     |   ...  |\r\n  |  13th November to    |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |  8th January         |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |                      |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |Korti to Matammeh and |    155   |       19   |       5     |    20  |\r\n  |  back, 8th January   |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |  to 8th March        |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |                      |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |At Korti, 8th January |     73   |      ...   |       2     |   ...  |\r\n  |  to 8th March        |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |                      |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |With River Column,    |    107   |        3   |       1     |   ...  |\r\n  |  1st January to      |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |  8th March           |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |                      |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |Korti, Dongola, and   |    347   |        5   |       9     |   ...  |\r\n  |  other Stations,     |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |  9th March to        |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |  20th June           |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |                      |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |Dongola, Assouan,     |    380   |      ...   |       2     |   ...  |\r\n  |  21st June to        |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |  1st July 1885       |          |            |             |        |\r\n  |                      +----------+------------+-------------+--------+\r\n  |     Total deaths     |    ...   |       27   |      24     |    20  |\r\n  +----------------------+----------+------------+-------------+--------+\r\n\r\n_A few practical lessons learnt._\r\n\r\n1. When water was limited to two gallons or less it was given in\r\nsmall quantities, not all at once. Even one pint to the horses, or\r\njust enough to moisten their mouths, enabled them to come up to\r\ntime again. On one occasion, late at night, the horses were much\r\nexhausted--we were 35 miles from water, and less than one pint left\r\nper horse--the horses could not eat, their mouths were so parched. I\r\nhad a sack of dhourra meal, and with the water made a number of moist\r\nballs of meal. These balls revived the horses, and they marched on\r\ntheir 35 miles next morning. I obtained this hint, previous to the\r\ncampaign, from General V. Baker, who told me that the Turkomans used\r\nto carry in skins balls of grease, or oil and meal.\r\n\r\n2. The horses were saved on every possible occasion, and by every\r\npossible device. The men never sat on their horses’ backs for a\r\nmoment longer than necessary. Marches in column were avoided,\r\nextended line being used, so that each horse had pure air to breathe;\r\nwhen picketed, horses always had plenty of room and their heads to\r\nthe breeze; when possible, they were washed two or three times a\r\nweek, which tended much towards their healthy condition.\r\n\r\n3. Several horses were severely wounded, but recovered rapidly,\r\nalthough in a very exhausted condition.\r\n\r\n4. The horses were fed, whenever possible, on the grass of the Bayuda\r\nDesert. This grass was very dry. The horses chewed it, but ate very\r\nlittle. During the last few days of the march to Matammeh, there was\r\nno opportunity for giving the horses any grass.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions, tins of mouldy biscuit, unfit for issue to the\r\nmen, were obtained from the Commissariat, and the biscuit given to\r\nthe horses.\r\n\r\nThey ate this greedily and worked on it.\r\n\r\n  P.

Dispatch to Court of Directors 31st Oct. 1782.\r\n\r\n[7] This was the reason given by the Madras Council. According to\r\nanother account, the rice was not landed, because the Governor, Lord\r\nMacartney, had laid an embargo on it, and would neither give an\r\nadequate price for it, nor suffer it to be landed for sale to the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n[8] _Annual Register._\r\n\r\n[9] Portuguese half castes and native Christians.\r\n\r\n[10] “We conceive that there is a slight transition from refusal to\r\nemploy the King’s troops upon a requisition by the Civil Government,\r\nto the employing them without a requisition, and we submit to you\r\nto what uses such an authority might be applied, and where the\r\nconsequences might end.”--_Letter to Court of Directors, December\r\n1782._\r\n\r\n[11] _13th August 1783._\r\n\r\n[12] The power of ordering Courts Martial for the trial of officers\r\nand soldiers, both in the service of the King and those acting under\r\nthe Company, was vested in the Commander in Chief of His Majesty’s\r\nforces for the time being.\r\n\r\n[13] Twelve of the ringleaders were selected for execution. Eleven\r\nof them were blown away from guns: the twelfth was pardoned after\r\nthe gun had missed fire three times. This was the recognised mode of\r\nexecution in India for military mutiny, and the Company’s European\r\ntroops were equally liable to this punishment.\r\n\r\n[14] 135 horses died or were cast between 1st June 1783 and 10th May\r\n1785.\r\n\r\n[15] Soon after his arrival in England he received a challenge\r\nfrom General Stuart, by whom he was wounded in a duel, fought near\r\nKensington, 8th June 1786. A letter from Sir John Burgoyne, written\r\nwhilst under arrest, shows his intention of calling Lord Macartney to\r\naccount in a similar way.\r\n\r\n[16] This would seem to show that Lang, like Stuart, also held a\r\nhalf-pay commission from the King.\r\n\r\n[17] _Calcutta Gazette. 18th August 1785._\r\n\r\n[18] Narrative of the Military operations on the Coromandel Coast.\r\n_Innes Munro._ 1789.\r\n\r\n[19] _Lieut.

He commanded a corps, and, in company with another corps\r\ncommander, an American named Boyd, made known his determination to\r\nuphold the Company’s authority against French intrigues. Some time\r\nafter the disarmament of the Nizam’s troops he was reinstated in his\r\nposition in the Nizam’s service.\r\n\r\n[35] In November 1802 the number of gun lascars was reduced to 1\r\nFirst Tindal and 10 men for each European Regiment.\r\n\r\n[36] _Thorn._\r\n\r\n[37] Afterwards Field Marshal the Duke of Wellington.\r\n\r\n[38] Not the officer of the same name who was formerly\r\nCommander-in-Chief in Madras.\r\n\r\n[39] _Lord Combermere’s correspondence._\r\n\r\n[40] _Wilks’s Mysore._\r\n\r\n[41] “Time and the number of guns formed the principle of our\r\nsignals; for example, three guns at half-past seven denoted a\r\nposition two marches from Seringapatam: two guns at eight might have\r\ndenoted any other communication. And in this manner may detachments\r\nor armies on some occasions communicate intelligence, which, by\r\nmessenger, might be impracticable. To ascertain that the signal of\r\nthe Bombay army was understood, it was agreed to fire the same number\r\nof guns, in our camp ten minutes afterwards.”--_Beatson’s Mysore\r\nWar._ General Floyd’s signal to establish communication with General\r\nStuart on the 8th was two guns fired precisely at four o’clock; and,\r\na little afterwards, four guns at intervals of a minute each. In\r\nabout half an hour afterwards the same signal was repeated.--_Memoirs\r\nof a Field Officer._\r\n\r\n[42] _Wellesley correspondence._\r\n\r\n[43] The rest of the army did not reach Poona till the 23rd.\r\n\r\n[44] According to the order of march observed, the advanced guard was\r\ncomposed of one half company from each Infantry Regiment, forming the\r\npicquets coming on duty, under the Field Officer of the day. In the\r\nsame way, the rearguard was formed of the picquets coming off duty.\r\n\r\n[45] _Grant Duff’s History of the Mahrattas._\r\n\r\n[46] _Life of Mountstuart Elphinstone._\r\n\r\n[47] _History of the Madras Army._ The number of guns captured at\r\nAssaye is generally stated as 98.

Though this was probably an exaggeration, it\r\nsuffices to show that they were very numerous.\r\n\r\n[56] “Nothing would appear to be more trivial to the public interests\r\nthan the length of the hair on the upper lip of a sepoy, yet to the\r\nindividual himself, the shape and fashion of the whisker is a badge\r\nof his caste, and an article of his religion.”--_Report of Special\r\nCommission on mutiny at Vellore._\r\n\r\n[57] _Quebec Mercury_, 18th May 1813.\r\n\r\n[58] He had been created a Knight of the Bath for his victory at\r\nDetroit.\r\n\r\n[59] The present town of Toronto was known as York in 1813.\r\n\r\n[60] _Lundy’s Lane Hist.

Ross\r\nattacked without waiting for his Rear Division and the rest of the\r\nNaval Brigade.\r\n\r\n[66] _See_ page 167.\r\n\r\n[67] Horse Guards order, dated 28th October 1817.\r\n\r\n[68] It is not quite certain whether the guidons were new ones given\r\nto the Regiment in 1808, or the old ones with the badges embroidered\r\non them in that year.\r\n\r\n[69] _Standards and Colours of the Army_, by S. M. Milne. I am mainly\r\nindebted to Mr Milne for the drawings from which the accompanying\r\nPlate was prepared.\r\n\r\n[70] The force was mainly composed of the men who had fought against\r\nus under Arabi. They could hardly have been expected to fight well.\r\n\r\n[71] G.O. by Sir G. Graham.\r\n\r\n[72] Sir Charles Wilson, in _From Korti to Khartoum_.\r\n\r\n[73] Number of regiment changed to the Eighteenth in this year.\r\n\r\n[74] Number of the regiment changed in this year to the Nineteenth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\n  Some placenames have been adjusted to be consistent within the\r\n  book. Some have been left unchanged even when they are probably\r\n  incorrect, for example ‘Ticonderago’ and ‘Chumbul’.\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been\r\n  corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within\r\n  the text and consultation of external sources.\r\n\r\n  In Appendix A which has tables of the officer lists for most\r\n  years from 1760 to 1899, lists for the years 1764 to 1778,\r\n  1822 to 1858 and 1862 were absent from the original book.\r\n\r\n  The { and } bracketing has been removed from the tables in the\r\n  Appendices, and from the tables on pages 14, 28 and 226, in order\r\n  to save table space and make the etext more readable. In the\r\n  tables of Appendix A, sometimes a space has been removed to fit a\r\n  name or title in a cell; for example, ‘_Asst. Surgeon_’ has been\r\n  changed to ‘_Asst.Surgeon_’.\r\n\r\n  Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text,\r\n  and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained: for example,\r\n  overtaxed, over-taxed; reinforcements, re-inforcements; aweful;\r\n  feudatory; necessaries; signalised; chesnut.\r\n\r\n  Pg 66: ‘up acccording to’ replaced by ‘up according to’.\r\n  Pg 97: ‘Abercomby joined’ replaced by ‘Abercromby joined’.\r\n  Pg 144 Footnote 46: ‘Life of Mounstuart’ replaced by\r\n         ‘Life of Mountstuart’.\r\n  Pg 163: ‘hastily gallopping’ replaced by ‘hastily galloping’.\r\n  Pg 177: ‘Sir George Prevot,’ replaced by ‘Sir George Prevost,’.\r\n  Pg 194: ‘on the Mississipi,’ replaced by ‘on the Mississippi,’.\r\n  Pg 215: ‘Mississipi which’ replaced by ‘Mississippi which’.\r\n  Pg 227: ‘battles of Meanee’ replaced by ‘battles of Meeanee’.\r\n  Pg 230: ‘Abor Hill’ replaced by ‘Arbour Hill’.\r\n  Pg 236: ‘at Mahsama without’ replaced by ‘at Mahsamah without’.\r\n\r\n  Index: ‘Jaffrabad,’ replaced by ‘Jaffirabad,’.\r\n  Index: ‘Mahsama,’ replaced by ‘Mahsamah,’.\r\n  Index: ‘M‘Arthur,’ replaced by ‘McArthur,’.\r\n  Index: ‘M‘Clure,’ replaced by ‘McClure,’.\r\n  Index: ‘M‘Douall,’ replaced by ‘McDouall,’.",
