In Holland, they joined the army of the\r\nPrince of Orange, afterwards William III., King of England. After\r\ndriving the armies of Louis XIV. out of Ireland, they met the French\r\nat Ramilies, Blenheim, and Malplacquet, and other battles in the Low\r\nCountries. A Huguenot engineer directed the operations at the siege of\r\nNamur, which ended in its capture. Another conducted the siege of\r\nLille, which was also taken.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the greatest number of Huguenot nobles entered the\r\nPrussian service. Their descendants revisited France on more than one\r\noccasion. They overran the northern and eastern parts of France in\r\n1814 and 1815; and last of all they vanquished the descendants of\r\ntheir former persecutors at Sedan in 1870. Sedan was, prior to the\r\nRevocation of the Edict of Nantes, the renowned seat of Protestant\r\nlearning; while now it is known as the scene of the greatest military\r\ncatastrophe which has occurred in modern history.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister of France, M. Jules Simon, not long ago recorded\r\nthe fateful effects of Louis XIV.'s religious intolerance. In\r\ndiscussing the perpetual ecclesiastical questions which still disturb\r\nFrance, he recalled the fact that not less than eighty of the German\r\nstaff in the late war were representatives of Protestant families,\r\ndriven from France by the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.\r\n\r\nThe first of the appended memoirs is that of Samuel de Péchels, a\r\nnoble of Languedoc, who, after enduring great privations, reached\r\nEngland through Jamaica, and served as a lieutenant in Ireland under\r\nWilliam III. Many of his descendants have been distinguished soldiers\r\nin the service of England. The second is Captain Rapin, who served\r\nfaithfully in Ireland, and was called away to be tutor to the young\r\nDuke of Portland. He afterwards spent his time at Wesel on the Rhine,\r\nwhere he wrote his \"History of England.\" The third is Captain Riou,\r\n\"the gallant and the good,\" who was killed at the battle of\r\nCopenhagen. These memoirs might be multiplied to any extent; but those\r\ngiven are enough to show the good work which the Huguenots and their\r\ndescendants have done in the service of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSix years since, I published a book entitled _The Huguenots: their\r\nSettlements, Churches, and Industries, in England and Ireland_. Its\r\nobject was to give an account of the causes which led to the large\r\nmigrations of foreign Protestants from Flanders and France into\r\nEngland, and to describe their effects upon English industry as well\r\nas English history.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to give a brief _résumé_ of the history of the\r\nReformation in France down to the dispersion of the Huguenots, and the\r\nsuppression of the Protestant religion by Louis XIV. under the terms\r\nof the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.\r\n\r\nUnder that Act, the profession of Protestantism was proclaimed to be\r\nillegal, and subject to the severest penalties. Hence, many of the\r\nFrench Protestants who refused to be \"converted,\" and had the means of\r\nemigrating, were under the necessity of leaving France and\r\nendeavouring to find personal freedom and religious liberty elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe refugees found protection in various countries. The principal\r\nportion of the emigrants from Languedoc and the south-eastern\r\nprovinces of France crossed the frontier into Switzerland, and settled\r\nthere, or afterwards proceeded into the states of Prussia, Holland,\r\nand Denmark, as well as into England and Ireland. The chief number of\r\nemigrants from the northern and western seaboard provinces of France,\r\nemigrated directly into England, Ireland, America, and the Cape of\r\nGood Hope. In my previous work, I endeavoured to give as accurate a\r\ndescription as was possible of the emigrants who settled in England\r\nand Ireland, to which, the American editor of the work (the Hon. G. P.\r\nDisosway) has added an account of those who settled in the United\r\nStates of America.\r\n\r\nBut besides the Huguenots who contrived to escape from Franco during\r\nthe dragonnades which preceded and the persecutions which followed the\r\nRevocation of the Edict of Nantes, there was still a very large number\r\nof Huguenots remaining in France who had not the means wherewith to\r\nfly from their country. These were the poorer people, the peasants,\r\nthe small farmers, the small manufacturers, many of whom were spoiled\r\nof their goods for the very purpose of preventing them from\r\nemigrating. They were consequently under the necessity of remaining in\r\ntheir native country, whether they changed their religion by force or\r\nnot. It is to give an account of these people, as a supplement to my\r\nformer book, that the present work is written.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to fix precisely the number of the Huguenots who\r\nleft France to avoid the cruelties of Louis XIV., as well as of those\r\nwho perforce remained to endure them. It shakes one's faith in history\r\nto observe the contradictory statements published with regard to\r\nFrench political or religious facts, even of recent date. A general\r\nimpression has long prevailed that there was a Massacre of St.\r\nBartholemew in Paris in the year 1572; but even that has recently been\r\ndenied, or softened down into a mere political squabble. It is not,\r\nhowever, possible to deny the fact that there was a Revocation of the\r\nEdict of Nantes in 1685, though it has been vindicated as a noble act\r\nof legislation, worthy even of the reputation and character of Louis\r\nthe Great.\r\n\r\nNo two writers agree as to the number of French citizens who were\r\ndriven from their country by the Revocation. A learned Roman Catholic,\r\nMr. Charles Butler, states that only 50,000 persons \"retired\" from\r\nFrance; whereas M. Capefigue, equally opposed to the Reformation, who\r\nconsulted the population tables of the period (although the intendants\r\nmade their returns as small as possible in order to avoid the reproach\r\nof negligence), calculates the emigration at 230,000 souls, namely,\r\n1,580 ministers, 2,300 elders, 15,000 gentlemen, the remainder\r\nconsisting almost entirely of traders and artisans.\r\n\r\nThese returns, quoted by M. Capefigue, were made only a few years\r\nafter the Revocation, although the emigration continued without\r\nintermission for many years later. M. Charles Coquerel says that\r\nwhatever horror may be felt for the Massacre of St. Bartholomew of\r\n1572, the persecutions which preceded and followed the Act of\r\nRevocation in 1685, \"kept France under a perpetual St. Bartholomew for\r\nabout sixty years.\" During that time it is believed that more than\r\n1,000,000 Frenchmen either left the kingdom, or were killed,\r\nimprisoned, or sent to the galleys in their efforts to escape.\r\n\r\nThe Intendant of Saintonge, a King's officer, not likely to exaggerate\r\nthe number of emigrants, reported in 1698, long before the emigration\r\nhad ceased, that his province had lost 100,000 Reformers. Languedoc\r\nsuffered far more; whilst Boulainvilliers reports that besides the\r\nemigrants who succeeded in making their escape, the province lost not\r\nfewer than 100,000 persons by premature death, the sword,\r\nstrangulation, and the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe number of French emigrants who resorted to England may be inferred\r\nfrom the fact that at the beginning of last century there were not\r\nfewer than _thirty-five_ French Protestant churches in London alone,\r\nat a time when the population of the metropolis was not one-fourth of\r\nwhat it is now; while there were other large French settlements at\r\nCanterbury, Norwich, Southampton, Bristol, Exeter, &c., as well as at\r\nDublin, Lisburn, Portarlington, and other towns in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThen, with respect to the much larger number of Protestants who\r\nremained in France after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, there\r\nis the same difference of opinion. A deputation of Huguenot pastors\r\nand elders, who waited upon the Duc de Noailles in 1682 informed him\r\nthat there were then 1,800,000 Protestant _families_ in France. Thirty\r\nyears after that date, Louis XIV. proclaimed that there were no\r\nProtestants whatever in France; that Protestantism had been entirely\r\nsuppressed, and that any one found professing that faith must be\r\nconsidered as a \"relapsed heretic,\" and sentenced to imprisonment, the\r\ngalleys, or the other punishments to which Protestants were then\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of about seventy-five years, during which\r\nProtestantism (though suppressed by the law) contrived to lead a sort\r\nof underground life--the Protestants meeting by night, and sometimes\r\nby day, in caves, valleys, moors, woods, old quarries, hollow beds of\r\nrivers, or, as they themselves called it, \"in the Desert\"--they at\r\nlength contrived to lift their heads into the light of day, and then\r\nRabaut St. Etienne stood up in the Constituent Assembly at Paris, in\r\n1787, and claimed the rights of his Protestant fellow-countrymen--the\r\nrights of \"2,000,000 useful citizens.\" Louis XVI. granted them an\r\nEdict of Tolerance, about a hundred years after Louis XIV. had revoked\r\nthe Edict of Nantes; but the measure proved too late for the King, and\r\ntoo late for France, which had already been sacrificed to the\r\nintolerance of Louis XIV. and his Jesuit advisers.\r\n\r\nAfter all the sufferings of France--after the cruelties to which her\r\npeople have been subjected by the tyranny of her monarchs and the\r\nintolerance of her priests,--it is doubtful whether she has yet learnt\r\nwisdom from her experience and trials. France was brought to ruin a\r\ncentury ago by the Jesuits who held the entire education of the\r\ncountry in their hands. They have again recovered their ground, and\r\nthe Congreganistes are now what the Jesuits were before. The\r\nSans-Culottes of 1793 were the pupils of the priests; so were the\r\nCommunists of 1871.[1] M. Edgar Quinet has recently said to his\r\ncountrymen: \"The Jesuitical and clerical spirit which has sneaked in\r\namong you and all your affairs has ruined you. It has corrupted the\r\nspring of life; it has delivered you over to the enemy.... Is this to\r\nlast for ever? For heaven's sake spare us at least the sight of a\r\nJesuits' Republic as the coronation of our century.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 1: M. Simiot's speech before the National Assembly,\r\n         16th March, 1873.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these prophecies of ruin, we have M. Veuillot frankly\r\navowing his Ultramontane policy in the _Univers_. He is quite willing\r\nto go back to the old burnings, hangings, and quarterings, to prevent\r\nany freedom of opinion about religious matters. \"For my part,\" he\r\nsays, \"I frankly avow my regret not only that John Huss was not burnt\r\nsooner, but that Luther was not burnt too. And I regret further that\r\nthere has not been some prince sufficiently pious and politic to have\r\nmade a crusade against the Protestants.\"\r\n\r\nM. Veuillot is perhaps entitled to some respect for boldly speaking\r\nout what he means and thinks. There are many amongst ourselves who\r\nmean the same thing, without having the courage to say so--who hate\r\nthe Reformation quite as much as M. Veuillot does, and would like to\r\nsee the principles of free examination and individual liberty torn up\r\nroot and branch.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the proposed crusade against Protestantism, it will be\r\nseen from the following work what the \"pious and politic\" Louis XIV.\r\nattempted, and how very inefficient his measures eventually proved in\r\nputting down Protestantism, or in extending Catholicism. Louis XIV.\r\nfound it easier to make martyrs than apostates; and discovered that\r\nhanging, banishment, the galleys, and the sword were not amongst the\r\nmost successful of \"converters.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of the Huguenots during the time of their submergence as\r\nan \"underground church\" is scarcely treated in the general histories\r\nof France. Courtly writers blot them out of history as Louis XIV.\r\ndesired to blot them out of France. Most histories of France published\r\nin England contain little notice of them. Those who desire to pursue\r\nthe subject further, will obtain abundant information, more\r\nparticularly from the following works:--\r\n\r\nELIE BÉNOÎT: _Histoire de l'Édit de Nantes._ CHARLES COQUEREL:\r\n_Histoire des Églises du Désert._ NAPOLEON PEYRAT: _Histoire des\r\nPasteurs du Désert._ ANTOINE COURT: _Histoire des Troubles de\r\nCevennes._ EDMUND HUGHES: _Histoire de la Restauration du\r\nProtestantisme en France au xviii. Siècle._ A. BONNEMÈRE: _Histoire\r\ndes Camisardes._ ADOLPHE MICHEL: _Louvois et Les Protestantes._\r\nATHANASE COQUEREL FILS; _Les Forçats pour La Foi, &c., &c._\r\n\r\nIt remains to be added that part of this work--viz., the \"Wars of the\r\nCamisards,\" and the \"Journey in the Country of the Vaudois\"--originally\r\nappeared in _Good Words_.\r\n\r\n                                                  S.S.\r\n\r\nLONDON, _October_, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUGUENOTS IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nREVOCATION OF THE EDICT OF NANTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Revocation of the Edict of Nantes was signed by Louis XIV. of\r\nFrance, on the 18th of October, 1685, and published four days\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Revocation was the personal act of the King, it was\r\nnevertheless a popular measure, approved by the Catholic Church of\r\nFrance, and by the great body of the French people.\r\n\r\nThe King had solemnly sworn, at the beginning of his reign, to\r\nmaintain, the tolerating Edict of Henry IV.--the Huguenots being\r\namongst the most industrious, enterprising, and loyal of his subjects.\r\nBut the advocacy of the King's then Catholic mistress, Madame de\r\nMaintenon, and of his Jesuit Confessor, Père la Chaise, overcame his\r\nscruples, and the deed of Revocation of the Edict was at length signed\r\nand published.\r\n\r\nThe aged Chancellor, Le Tellier, was so overjoyed at the measure, that\r\non affixing the great seal of France to the deed, he exclaimed, in the\r\nwords of Simeon, \"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,\r\nfor mine eyes have seen the salvation.\"\r\n\r\nThree months later, the great Bossuet, the eagle of Meaux, preached\r\nthe funeral sermon of Le Tellier; in the course of which he testified\r\nto the immense joy of the Church at the Revocation of the Edict. \"Let\r\nus,\" said he, \"expand our hearts in praises of the piety of Louis. Let\r\nour acclamations ascend to heaven, and let us say to this new\r\nConstantine, this new Theodosius, this new Marcian, this new\r\nCharlemagne, what the thirty-six fathers formerly said in the Council\r\nof Chalcedon: 'You have affirmed the faith, you have exterminated the\r\nheretics; it is a work worthy of your reign, whose proper character it\r\nis. Thanks to you, heresy is no more. God alone can have worked this\r\nmarvel. King of heaven, preserve the King of earth: it is the prayer\r\nof the Church, it is the prayer of the Bishops.'\"[2]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 2: Bossuet, \"Oraison Funèbre du Chancelier\r\n         Letellier.\"]\r\n\r\nMadame de Maintenon also received the praises of the Church. \"All good\r\npeople,\" said the Abbé de Choisy, \"the Pope, the bishops, and all the\r\nclergy, rejoice at the victory of Madame de Maintenon.\" Madame enjoyed\r\nthe surname of Director of the Affairs of the Clergy; and it was said\r\nby the ladies of St. Cyr (an institution founded by her), that \"the\r\ncardinals and the bishops knew no other way of approaching the King\r\nsave through her.\"\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that her price for obtaining the King's\r\nconsent to the Act of Revocation, was the withdrawal by the clergy of\r\ntheir opposition to her marriage with the King; and that the two were\r\nprivately united by the Archbishop of Paris at Versailles, a few days\r\nafter, in the presence of Père la Chaise and two more witnesses. But\r\nLouis XIV. never publicly recognised De Maintenon as his wife--never\r\nrescued her from the ignominious position in which she originally\r\nstood related to him.\r\n\r\nPeople at court all spoke with immense praises of the King's\r\nintentions with respect to destroying the Huguenots. \"Killing them\r\noff\" was a matter of badinage with the courtiers. Madame de Maintenon\r\nwrote to the Duc de Noailles, \"The soldiers are killing numbers of the\r\nfanatics--they hope soon to free Languedoc of them.\"\r\n\r\nThat picquante letter-writer, Madame de Sévigné, often referred to the\r\nHuguenots. She seems to have classed them with criminals or wild\r\nbeasts. When residing in Low Brittany during a revolt against the\r\nGabelle, a friend wrote to her, \"How dull you must be!\" \"No,\" replied\r\nMadame de Sévigné, \"we are not so dull--hanging is quite a refreshment\r\nto me! They have just taken twenty-four or thirty of these men, and\r\nare going to throw them off.\"\r\n\r\nA few days after the Edict had been revoked, she wrote to her cousin\r\nBussy, at Paris: \"You have doubtless seen the Edict by which the King\r\nrevokes that of Nantes. There is nothing so fine as that which it\r\ncontains, and never has any King done, or ever will do, a more\r\nmemorable act.\" Bussy replied to her: \"I immensely admire the conduct\r\nof the King in destroying the Huguenots. The wars which have been\r\nwaged against them, and the St. Bartholomew, have given some\r\nreputation to the sect. His Majesty has gradually undermined it; and\r\nthe edict he has just published, maintained by the dragoons and by\r\nBourdaloue,[3] will soon give them the _coup de grâce_.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 3: Bourdaloue had just been sent from the Jesuit\r\n         Church of St. Louis at Paris, to Montpellier, to aid the\r\n         dragoons in converting the Protestants, and bringing them\r\n         back to the Church.]\r\n\r\nIn a future letter to Count Bussy, Madame de Sévigné informed him of\r\n\"a dreadfully fatiguing journey which her son-in-law M. de Grignan had\r\nmade in the mountains of Dauphiny, to pursue and punish the miserable\r\nHuguenots, who issued from their holes, and vanished like ghosts to\r\navoid extermination.\"\r\n\r\nDe Baville, however, the Lieutenant of Languedoc, kept her in good\r\nheart. In one of his letters, he said, \"I have this morning condemned\r\nseventy-six of these wretches (Huguenots), and sent them to the\r\ngalleys.\" All this was very pleasant to Madame de Sévigné.\r\n\r\nMadame de Scuderi, also, more moderately rejoiced in the Act of\r\nRevocation. \"The King,\" she wrote to Bussy, \"has worked great marvels\r\nagainst the Huguenots; and the authority which he has employed to\r\nunite them to the Church will be most salutary to themselves and to\r\ntheir children, who will be educated in the purity of the faith; all\r\nthis will bring upon him the benedictions of Heaven.\"\r\n\r\nEven the French Academy, though originally founded by a Huguenot,\r\npublicly approved the deed of Revocation. In a discourse uttered\r\nbefore it, the Abbé Tallemand exclaimed, when speaking of the Huguenot\r\ntemple at Charenton, which had just been destroyed by the mob, \"Happy\r\nruins, the finest trophy France ever beheld!\" La Fontaine described\r\nheresy as now \"reduced to the last gasp.\" Thomas Corneille also\r\neulogized the zeal of the King in \"throttling the Reformation.\"\r\nBarbier D'Aucourt heedlessly, but truly, compared the emigration of\r\nthe Protestants \"to the departure of the Israelites from Egypt.\" The\r\nAcademy afterwards proposed, as the subject of a poem, the Revocation\r\nof the Edict of Nantes, and Fontenelle had the fortune, good or bad,\r\nof winning the prize.\r\n\r\nThe philosophic La Bruyère contributed a maxim in praise of the\r\nRevocation. Quinault wrote a poem on the subject; and Madame\r\nDeshoulières felt inspired to sing \"The Destruction of Heresy.\" The\r\nAbbé de Rancé spoke of the whole affair as a prodigy: \"The Temple of\r\nCharenton destroyed, and no exercise of Protestantism, within the\r\nkingdom; it is a kind of miracle, such as we had never hoped to have\r\nseen in our day.\"\r\n\r\nThe Revocation was popular with the lower class, who went about\r\nsacking and pulling down the Protestant churches. They also tracked\r\nthe Huguenots and their pastors, where they found them evading or\r\nbreaking the Edict of Revocation; thus earning the praises of the\r\nChurch and the fines offered by the King for their apprehension. The\r\nprovosts and sheriffs of Paris represented the popular feeling, by\r\nerecting a brazen statue of the King who had rooted out heresy; and\r\nthey struck and distributed medals in honour of the great event.\r\n\r\nThe Revocation was also popular with the dragoons. In order to\r\n\"convert\" the Protestants, the dragoons were unduly billeted upon\r\nthem. As both officers and soldiers were then very badly paid, they\r\nwere thereby enabled to live at free quarters. They treated everything\r\nin the houses they occupied as if it were their own, and an assignment\r\nof billets was little loss than the consignment of the premises to the\r\nmilitary, to use for their own purposes, during the time they occupied\r\nthem.[4]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 4: Sir John Reresby's Travels and Memoirs.]\r\n\r\nThe Revocation was also approved by those who wished to buy land\r\ncheap. As the Huguenots were prevented holding their estates unless\r\nthey conformed to the Catholic religion, and as many estates were\r\naccordingly confiscated and sold, land speculators, as well as grand\r\nseigneurs who wished to increase their estates, were constantly on the\r\nlook-out for good bargains. Even before the Revocation, when the\r\nHuguenots were selling their land in order to leave the country,\r\nMadame de Maintenon wrote to her nephew, for whom she had obtained\r\nfrom the King a grant of 800,000 francs, \"I beg of you carefully to\r\nuse the money you are about to receive. Estates in Poitou may be got\r\nfor nothing; the desolation of the Huguenots will drive them to sell\r\nmore. You may easily acquire extensive possessions in Poitou.\"\r\n\r\nThe Revocation was especially gratifying to the French Catholic\r\nChurch. The Pope, of course, approved of it. _Te Deums_ were sung at\r\nRome in thanksgiving for the forced conversion of the Huguenots. Pope\r\nInnocent XI. sent a brief to Louis XIV., in which he promised him the\r\nunanimous praises of the Church, \"Amongst all the proofs,\" said he,\r\n\"which your Majesty has given of natural piety, not the least\r\nbrilliant is the zeal, truly worthy of the most Christian King, which\r\nhas induced you to revoke all the ordinances issued in favour of the\r\nheretics of your kingdom.\"[5]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 5: Pope Innocent XI.'s Letter of November 13th,\r\n         1685.]\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits were especially elated by the Revocation. It had been\r\nbrought about by the intrigues of their party, acting on the King's\r\nmind through Madame de Maintenon and Père la Chaise. It enabled them\r\nto fill their schools and nunneries with the children of Protestants,\r\nwho were compelled by law to pay for their education by Jesuit\r\npriests. To furnish the required accommodation, nearly the whole of\r\nthe Protestant temples that had not been pulled down were made over\r\nto the Jesuits, to be converted into monastic schools and nunneries.\r\nEven Bossuet, the \"last father of the Church,\" shared in the spoils of\r\nthe Huguenots. A few days after the Edict had been revoked, Bossuet\r\napplied for the materials of the temples of Nauteuil and Morcerf,\r\nsituated in his diocese; and his Majesty ordered that they should be\r\ngranted to him.[6]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 6: \"Louvois et les Protestants,\" par Adolphe\r\n         Michel, p. 286.]\r\n\r\nNow that Protestantism had been put down, and the officers of Louis\r\nannounced from all parts of the kingdom that the Huguenots were\r\nbecoming converted by thousands, there was nothing but a clear course\r\nbefore the Jesuits in France. For their religion was now the favoured\r\nreligion of the State.\r\n\r\nIt is true there were the Jansenists--declared to be heretical by the\r\nPopes, and distinguished for their opposition to the doctrines and\r\nmoral teaching of the Jesuits--who were suffering from a persecution\r\nwhich then drove some of the members of Port Royal into exile, and\r\neventually destroyed them. But even the Jansenists approved the\r\npersecution of the Protestants. The great Arnault, their most\r\nillustrious interpreter, though in exile in the Low Countries,\r\ndeclared that though the means which Louis XIV. had employed had been\r\n\"rather violent, they had in nowise been unjust.\"\r\n\r\nBut Protestantism being declared destroyed, and Jansenism being in\r\ndisgrace, there was virtually no legal religion in France but\r\none--that of the Roman Catholic Church. Atheism, it is true, was\r\ntolerated, but then Atheism was not a religion. The Atheists did not,\r\nlike the Protestants, set up rival churches, or appoint rival\r\nministers, and seek to draw people to their assemblies. The Atheists,\r\nthough they tacitly approved the religion of the King, had no\r\nopposition to offer to it--only neglect, and perhaps concealed\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nHence it followed that the Court and the clergy had far more\r\ntoleration for Atheism than for either Protestantism or Jansenism. It\r\nis authentically related that Louis XIV. on one occasion objected to\r\nthe appointment of a representative on a foreign mission on account of\r\nthe person being supposed to be a Jansenist; but on its being\r\ndiscovered that the nominee was only an Atheist, the objection was at\r\nonce withdrawn.[7]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 7: _Quarterly Review._]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Revocation, when the King and the Catholic Church\r\nwere resolved to tolerate no religion other than itself, the Church\r\nhad never seemed so powerful in France. It had a strong hold upon the\r\nminds of the people. It was powerful in its leaders and its great\r\npreachers; in fact, France has never, either before or since,\r\nexhibited such an array of preaching genius as Bossuet, Bourdaloue,\r\nFléchier, and Massillon.\r\n\r\nYet the uncontrolled and enormously increased power conferred upon the\r\nFrench Church at that time, most probably proved its greatest\r\ncalamity. Less than a hundred years after the Revocation, the Church\r\nhad lost its influence over the people, and was despised. The Deists\r\nand Atheists, sprung from the Church's bosom, were in the ascendant;\r\nand Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot, and Mirabeau, were regarded as\r\ngreater men than either Bossuet, Bourdaloue, Fléchier, or Massillon.\r\n\r\nNot one of the clergy we have named, powerful orators though they\r\nwere, ever ventured to call in question the cruelties with which the\r\nKing sought to compel the Protestants to embrace the dogmas of their\r\nChurch. There were no doubt many Catholics who deplored the force\r\npractised on the Huguenots; but they were greatly in the minority,\r\nand had no power to make their opposition felt. Some of them\r\nconsidered it an impious sacrilege to compel the Protestants to take\r\nthe Catholic sacrament--to force them to accept the host, which\r\nCatholics believed to be the veritable body of Christ, but which the\r\nHuguenots could only accept as bread, over which some function had\r\nbeen performed by the priests, in whose miraculous power of conversion\r\nthey did not believe.\r\n\r\nFénélon took this view of the forcible course employed by the Jesuits;\r\nbut he was in disgrace as a Jansenist, and what he wrote on the\r\nsubject remained for a long time unknown, and was only first published\r\nin 1825. The Duc de Saint-Simon, also a Jansenist, took the same view,\r\nwhich he embodied in his \"Memoirs;\" but these were kept secret by his\r\nfamily, and were not published for nearly a century after his death.\r\n\r\nThus the Catholic Church remained triumphant. The Revocation was\r\napparently approved by all, excepting the Huguenots. The King was\r\nflattered by the perpetual conversions reported to be going on\r\nthroughout the country--five thousand persons in one place, ten\r\nthousand in another, who had abjured and taken the communion--at once,\r\nand sometimes \"instantly.\"\r\n\r\n\"The King,\" says Saint-Simon, \"congratulated himself on his power and\r\nhis piety. He believed himself to have renewed the days of the\r\npreaching of the Apostles, and attributed to himself all the honour.\r\nThe Bishops wrote panegyrics of him; the Jesuits made the pulpits\r\nresound with his praises.... He swallowed their poison in deep\r\ndraughts.\"[8]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 8: \"Memoirs of the Duke of Saint-Simon,\" translated\r\n         by Bayle St. John, vol. III. p 250.]\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. lived for thirty years after the Edict of Nantes had been\r\nrevoked. He had therefore the fullest opportunity of observing the\r\nresults of the policy he had pursued. He died in the hands of the\r\nJesuits, his body covered with relics of the true cross. Madame de\r\nMaintenon, the \"famous and fatal witch,\" as Saint-Simon called her,\r\nabandoned him at last; and the King died, lamented by no one.\r\n\r\nHe had banished, or destroyed, during-his reign, about a million of\r\nhis subjects, and those who remained did not respect him. Many\r\nregarded him as a self-conceited tyrant, who sought to save his own\r\nsoul by inflicting penance on the backs of others. He loaded his\r\nkingdom with debt, and overwhelmed his people with taxes. He destroyed\r\nthe industry of France, which had been mainly supported by the\r\nHuguenots. Towards the end of his life he became generally hated; and\r\nwhile his heart was conveyed to the Grand Jesuits, his body, which was\r\nburied at St. Denis, was hurried to the grave accompanied by the\r\nexecrations of the people.\r\n\r\nYet the Church remained faithful to him to the last. The great\r\nMassillon preached his funeral sermon; though the message was draped\r\nin the livery of the Court. \"How far,\" said he, \"did Louis XIV. carry\r\nhis zeal for the Church, that virtue of sovereigns who have received\r\npower and the sword only that they may be props of the altar and\r\ndefenders of its doctrine! Specious reasons of State! In vain did you\r\noppose to Louis the timid views of human wisdom, the body of the\r\nmonarchy enfeebled by the flight of so many citizens, the course of\r\ntrade slackened, either by the deprivation of their industry, or by\r\nthe furtive removal of their wealth! Dangers fortify his zeal. The\r\nwork of God fears not man. He believes even that he strengthens his\r\nthrone by overthrowing that of error. The profane temples are\r\ndestroyed, the pulpits of seduction are cast down. The prophets of\r\nfalsehood are torn from their flocks. At the first blow dealt to it by\r\nLouis, heresy falls, disappears, and is reduced either to hide itself\r\nin the obscurity whence it issued, or to cross the seas, and to bear\r\nwith it into foreign lands its false gods, its bitterness, and its\r\nrage.\"[9]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 9: Funeral Oration on Louis XIV.]\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the temper which the Huguenots displayed when\r\nthey were driven from France by persecution, they certainly carried\r\nwith them something far more valuable than rage. They carried with\r\nthem their virtue, piety, industry, and valour, which proved the\r\nsource of wealth, spirit, freedom, and character, in all those\r\ncountries--Holland, Prussia, England, and America--in which these\r\nnoble exiles took refuge.\r\n\r\nWe shall next see whether the Huguenots had any occasion for\r\nentertaining the \"rage\" which the great Massillon attributed to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE REVOCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Revocation struck with civil death the entire Protestant\r\npopulation of France. All the liberty of conscience which they had\r\nenjoyed under the Edict of Nantes, was swept away by the act of the\r\nKing. They were deprived of every right and privilege; their social\r\nlife was destroyed; their callings were proscribed; their property was\r\nliable to be confiscated at any moment; and they were subjected to\r\nmean, detestable, and outrageous cruelties.\r\n\r\nFrom the day of the Revocation, the relation of Louis XIV. to his\r\nHuguenot subjects was that of the Tyrant and his Victims. The only\r\nresource which remained to the latter was that of flying from their\r\nnative country; and an immense number of persons took the opportunity\r\nof escaping from France.\r\n\r\nThe Edict of Revocation proclaimed that the Huguenot subjects of\r\nFrance must thenceforward be of \"the King's religion;\" and the order\r\nwas promulgated throughout the kingdom. The Prime Minister, Louvois,\r\nwrote to the provincial governors, \"His Majesty desires that the\r\nseverest rigour shall be shown to those who will not conform to His\r\nReligion, and those who seek the foolish glory of wishing to be the\r\nlast, must be pushed to the utmost extremity.\"\r\n\r\nThe Huguenots were forbidden, under the penalty of death, to worship\r\npublicly after their own religious forms. They were also forbidden,\r\nunder the penalty of being sent to the galleys for life, to worship\r\nprivately in their own homes. If they were overheard singing their\r\nfavourite psalms, they were liable to fine, imprisonment, or the\r\ngalleys. They were compelled to hang out flags from their houses on\r\nthe days of Catholic processions; but they were forbidden, under a\r\nheavy penalty, to look out of their windows when the Corpus Domini was\r\nborne along the streets.\r\n\r\nThe Huguenots were rigidly forbidden to instruct their children in\r\ntheir own faith. They were commanded to send them to the priest to be\r\nbaptized and brought up in the Roman Catholic faith, under the penalty\r\nof five hundred livres fine in each case. The boys were educated in\r\nJesuit schools, the girls in nunneries, the parents being compelled to\r\npay the required expenses; and where the parents were too poor to pay,\r\nthe children were at once transferred to the general hospitals. A\r\ndecree of the King, published in December, 1685, ordered that every\r\nchild of _five years_ and upwards was to be taken possession of by the\r\nauthorities, and removed from its Protestant parents. This decree\r\noften proved a sentence of death, not only to the child, but to its\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Protestant temples throughout France were subject to\r\ndemolition. The expelled pastors were compelled to evacuate the\r\ncountry within fifteen days. If, in the meantime, they were found\r\nperforming their functions, they were liable to be sent to the galleys\r\nfor life. If they undertook to marry Protestants, the marriages were\r\ndeclared illegal, and the children bastards. If, after the expiry of\r\nthe fifteen days, they were found lingering in France, the pastors\r\nwere then liable to the penalty of death.\r\n\r\nProtestants could neither be born, nor live, nor die, without state\r\nand priestly interference. Protestant _sages-femmes_ were not\r\npermitted to exercise their functions; Protestant doctors were\r\nprohibited from practising; Protestant surgeons and apothecaries were\r\nsuppressed; Protestant advocates, notaries, and lawyers were\r\ninterdicted; Protestants could not teach, and all their schools,\r\npublic and private, were put down. Protestants were no longer employed\r\nby the Government in affairs of finance, as collectors of taxes, or\r\neven as labourers on the public roads, or in any other office. Even\r\nProtestant grocers were forbidden to exercise their calling.\r\n\r\nThere must be no Protestant librarians, booksellers, or printers.\r\nThere was, indeed, a general raid upon Protestant literature all over\r\nFrance. All Bibles, Testaments, and books of religious instruction,\r\nwere collected and publicly burnt. There were bonfires in almost every\r\ntown. At Metz, it occupied a whole day to burn the Protestant books\r\nwhich had been seized, handed over to the clergy, and condemned to be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nProtestants were even forbidden to hire out horses, and Protestant\r\ngrooms were forbidden to give riding lessons. Protestant domestics\r\nwere forbidden to hire themselves as servants, and Protestant\r\nmistresses were forbidden to hire them under heavy penalties. If they\r\nengaged Protestant servants, they were liable to be sent to the\r\ngalleys for life. They were even prevented employing \"new converts.\"\r\n\r\nArtisans were forbidden to work without certificates that their\r\nreligion was Catholic. Protestant apprenticeships were suppressed.\r\nProtestant washerwomen were excluded from their washing-places on the\r\nriver. In fact, there was scarcely a degradation that could be\r\ninvented, or an insult that could be perpetrated, that was not\r\npractised upon those poor Huguenots who refused to be of \"the King's\r\nreligion.\"\r\n\r\nEven when Protestants were about to take refuge in death, their\r\ntroubles were not over. The priests had the power of forcing their way\r\ninto the dying man's house, where they presented themselves at his\r\nbedside, and offered him conversion and the viaticum. If the dying man\r\nrefused these, he was liable to be seized after death, dragged from\r\nthe house, pulled along the streets naked, and buried in a ditch, or\r\nthrown upon a dunghill.[10]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 10: Such was, in fact, the end of a man so\r\n         distinguished as M. Paul Chenevix, Councillor of the Court of\r\n         Metz, who died in 1686, the year after the Revocation.\r\n         Although of the age of eighty, and so illustrious for his\r\n         learning, his dead body was dragged along the streets on a\r\n         hurdle and thrown upon a dunghill. See \"Huguenot Refugees and\r\n         their Descendants,\" under the name _Chenevix_. The present\r\n         Archbishop of Dublin is descended from his brother Philip\r\n         Chenevix, who settled in England shortly after the\r\n         Revocation.]\r\n\r\nFor several years before the Revocation, while the persecutions of the\r\nHuguenots had been increasing, many had realised their means, and fled\r\nabroad into Switzerland, Germany, Holland, and England. But after the\r\nRevocation, emigration from France was strictly forbidden, under\r\npenalty of confiscation of the whole goods and property of the\r\nemigrant. Any person found attempting to leave the country, was liable\r\nto the seizure of all that belonged to him, and to perpetual\r\nimprisonment at the galleys; one half the amount realised by the sale\r\nof the property being paid to the informers, who thus became the most\r\nactive agents of the Government. The Act also ordered that all landed\r\nproprietors who had left France before the Revocation, should return\r\nwithin four months, under penalty of confiscation of all their\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nAmongst those of the King's subjects who were the most ready to obey\r\nhis orders were some of the old Huguenot noble families, such as the\r\nmembers of the houses of Bouillon, Coligny, Rohan, Tremouille, Sully,\r\nand La Force. These great vassals, whom a turbulent feudalism had\r\nprobably in the first instance induced to embrace Protestantism, were\r\nnow found ready to change their profession of religion in servile\r\nobedience to the monarch.\r\n\r\nThe lesser nobility were more faithful and consistent. Many of them\r\nabandoned their estates and fled across the frontier, rather than live\r\na daily lie to God by forswearing the religion of their conscience.\r\nOthers of this class, on whom religion sat more lightly, as the only\r\nmeans of saving their property from confiscation, pretended to be\r\nconverted to Roman Catholicism; though, we shall find, that these \"new\r\nconverts,\" as they were called, were treated with as much suspicion on\r\nthe one side as they were regarded with contempt on the other.\r\n\r\nThere were also the Huguenot manufacturers, merchants, and employers of\r\nlabour, of whom a large number closed their workshops and factories,\r\nsold off their goods, converted everything into cash, at whatever\r\nsacrifice, and fled across the frontier into Switzerland--either\r\nsettling there, or passing through it on their way to Germany, Holland,\r\nor England.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to stop this emigration, which was rapidly\r\ndiminishing the population, and steadily impoverishing the country. It\r\nwas indeed a terrible thing for Frenchmen, to tear themselves away\r\nfrom their country--Frenchmen, who have always clung so close to\r\ntheir soil that they have rarely been able to form colonies of\r\nemigration elsewhere--it was breaking so many living fibres to leave\r\nFrance, to quit the homes of their fathers, their firesides, their\r\nkin, and their race. Yet, in a multitude of cases, they were compelled\r\nto tear themselves by the roots out of the France they so loved.\r\n\r\nYet it was so very easy for them to remain. The King merely required\r\nthem to be \"converted.\" He held that loyalty required them to be of\r\n\"his religion.\" On the 19th of October, 1685, the day after he had\r\nsigned the Act of Revocation, La Reynée, lieutenant of the police of\r\nParis, issued a notice to the Huguenot tradespeople and\r\nworking-classes, requiring them to be converted instantly. Many of\r\nthem were terrified, and conformed accordingly. Next day, another\r\nnotice was issued to the Huguenot bourgeois, requiring them to\r\nassemble on the following day for the purpose of publicly making a\r\ndeclaration of their conversion.\r\n\r\nThe result of those measures was to make hypocrites rather than\r\nbelievers, and they took effect upon the weakest and least-principled\r\npersons. The strongest, most independent, and high-minded of the\r\nHuguenots, who would _not_ be hypocrites, resolved passively to resist\r\nthem, and if they could not be allowed to exercise freedom of\r\nconscience in their own country, they determined to seek it elsewhere.\r\nHence the large increase in the emigration from all parts of France\r\nimmediately after the Act of Revocation had been proclaimed.[11] All\r\nthe roads leading to the frontier or the sea-coast streamed with\r\nfugitives. They went in various forms and guises--sometimes in bodies\r\nof armed men, at other times in solitary parties, travelling at night\r\nand sleeping in the woods by day. They went as beggars, travelling\r\nmerchants, sellers of beads and chaplets, gipsies, soldiers,\r\nshepherds, women with their faces dyed and sometimes dressed in men's\r\nclothes, and in all manner of disguises.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 11: It is believed that 400,000 emigrants left\r\n         France through religious persecution during the twenty years\r\n         previous to the Revocation, and that 600,000 escaped during\r\n         the twenty years after that event. M. Charles Coquerel\r\n         estimates the number of Protestants in France at that time to\r\n         have been two millions of _men_ (\"Églises du Désert,\" i. 497)\r\n         The number of Protestant pastors was about one thousand--of\r\n         whom six hundred went into exile, one hundred were executed\r\n         or sent to the galleys, and the rest are supposed to have\r\n         accepted pensions as \"new converts.\"]\r\n\r\nTo prevent this extensive emigration, more violent measures were\r\nadopted. Every road out of France was posted with guards. The towns,\r\nhighways, bridges, and ferries, were all watched; and heavy rewards\r\nwere promised to those who would stop and bring back the fugitives.\r\nMany were taken, loaded with irons, and dispatched by the most public\r\nroads through France--as a sight to be seen by other Protestants--to\r\nthe galleys at Marseilles, Brest, and other ports. As they went along\r\nthey were subject to every sort of indignity in the towns and villages\r\nthrough which they passed. They were hooted, stoned, spit upon, and\r\nloaded with insult.\r\n\r\nMany others went by sea, in French as well as in foreign ships. Though\r\nthe sailors of France were prohibited the exercise of the reformed\r\nreligion, under the penalty of fines, corporal punishment, and seizure\r\nof the vessels where the worship was allowed, yet many of the\r\nemigrants contrived to get away by the help of French ship captains,\r\nmasters of sloops, fishing-boats, and coast pilots--who most probably\r\nsympathized with the views of those who wished to fly their country\r\nrather than become hypocrites and forswear their religion. A large\r\nnumber of emigrants, who went hurriedly off to sea in little boats,\r\nmust have been drowned, as they were never afterwards heard of.\r\n\r\nThere were also many English ships that appeared off the coast to take\r\nthe flying Huguenots away by night. They also escaped in foreign ships\r\ntaking in their cargoes in the western harbours. They got cooped up in\r\ncasks or wine barraques, with holes for breathing places; others\r\ncontrived to get surreptitiously into the hold, and stowed themselves\r\naway among the goods. When it became known to the Government that many\r\nProtestants were escaping in this way, provision was made to meet the\r\ncase; and a Royal Order was issued that, before any ship was allowed\r\nto set sail for a foreign port, the hold should be fumigated with\r\ndeadly gas, so that any hidden Huguenot who could not otherwise be\r\ndetected, might thus be suffocated![12]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 12: We refer to \"The Huguenots: their Settlements,\r\n         Churches, and Industries in England and Ireland,\" where a\r\n         great many incidents are given relative to the escape of\r\n         refugees by land and sea, which need not here be repeated.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, numerous efforts were being made to convert\r\nthe Huguenots. The King, his ministers, the dragoons, the bishops, and\r\nclergy used all due diligence. \"Everybody is now missionary,\" said the\r\nfascinating Madame de Sévigné; \"each has his mission--above all the\r\nmagistrates and governors of provinces, _helped by the dragoons_. It\r\nis the grandest and finest thing that has ever been imagined and\r\nexecuted.\"[13]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 13: Letter to the President de Moulceau, November\r\n         24th, 1685.]\r\n\r\nThe conversions effected by the dragoons were much more sudden than\r\nthose effected by the priests. Sometimes a hundred or more persons\r\nwere converted by a single troop within an hour. In this way Murillac\r\nconverted thousands of persons in a week. The regiment of Ashfeld\r\nconverted the whole province of Poitou in a month.\r\n\r\nDe Noailles was very successful in his conversions. He converted\r\nNismes in twenty-four hours; the day after he converted Montpellier;\r\nand he promised in a few weeks to deliver all Lower Languedoc from the\r\nleprosy of heresy. In one of his dispatches soon after the Revocation,\r\nhe boasted that he had converted 350 nobility and gentry, 54\r\nministers, and 25,000 individuals of various classes.\r\n\r\nThe quickness of the conversions effected by the dragoons is easily to\r\nbe accounted for. The principal cause was the free quartering of\r\nsoldiers in the houses of the Protestants. The soldiers knew what was\r\nthe object for which they were thus quartered. They lived freely in\r\nall ways. They drank, swore, shouted, beat the heretics, insulted\r\ntheir women, and subjected them to every imaginable outrage and\r\ninsult.\r\n\r\nOne of their methods of making converts was borrowed from the\r\npersecutions of the Vaudois. It consisted in forcing the feet of the\r\nintended converts into boots full of boiling grease, or they would\r\nhang them up by the feet, sometimes forgetting to cut them down until\r\nthey were dead. They would also force them to drink water perpetually,\r\nor make them sit under a slow dripping upon their heads until they\r\ndied of madness. Sometimes they placed burning coals in their hands,\r\nor used an instrument of torture resembling that known in Scotland as\r\nthe thumbscrews.[14] Many of their attempts at conversion were\r\naccompanied by details too hideous to be recorded.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 14: Thumbscrews were used in the reign of James II.\r\n         Louis and James borrowed from each other the means of\r\n         converting heretics; but whether the origin of the thumbscrew\r\n         be French or Scotch is not known.]\r\n\r\nOf those who would not be converted, the prisons were kept full. They\r\nwere kept there without the usual allowance of straw, and almost\r\nwithout food. In winter they had no fire, and at night no lamp. Though\r\nill, they had no doctors. Besides the gaoler, their only visitors were\r\npriests and monks, entreating them to make abjuration. Of course many\r\ndied in prison--feeble women, and aged and infirm men. In the society\r\nof obscene criminals, with whom many were imprisoned, they prayed for\r\nspeedy deliverance by death, and death often came to their help.\r\n\r\nMore agreeable, but still more insulting, methods of conversion were\r\nalso attempted. Louis tried to bribe the pastors by offering them an\r\nincrease of annual pay beyond their former stipends. If there were a\r\nProtestant judge or advocate, Louvois at once endeavoured to bribe him\r\nover. For instance, there was a heretical syndic of Strasbourg, to\r\nwhom Louvois wrote, \"Will you be converted? I will give you 6,000\r\nlivres of pension.--Will you not? I will dismiss you.\"\r\n\r\nOf course many of the efforts made to convert the Huguenots proved\r\nsuccessful. The orders of the Prime Minister, the free quarters\r\nafforded to the dragoons, the preachings and threatenings of the\r\nclergy, all contributed to terrify the Protestants. The fear of being\r\nsent to the galleys for life--the threat of losing the whole of one's\r\ngoods and property--the alarm of seeing one's household broken up, the\r\nchildren seized by the priests and sent to the nearest monkery or\r\nnunnery for maintenance and education--all these considerations\r\ndoubtless had their effect in increasing the number of conversions.\r\n\r\nPersecution is not easy to bear. To have all the powers and\r\nauthorities employed against one's life, interests, and faith, is\r\nwhat few can persistently oppose. And torture, whether it be slow or\r\nsudden, is what many persons, by reason of their physical capacity,\r\nhave not the power to resist. Even the slow torment of dragoons\r\nquartered in the houses of the heretics--their noise and shoutings,\r\ntheir drinking and roistering, the insults and outrages they were\r\nallowed to practise--was sufficient to compel many at once to declare\r\nthemselves to be converted.\r\n\r\nIndeed, pain is, of all things, one of the most terrible of\r\nconverters. One of the prisoners condemned to the galleys, when he saw\r\nthe tortures which the victims about him had to endure by night and by\r\nday, said that sufferings such as these were \"enough to make one\r\nconform to Buddhism or Mahommedanism as well as to Popery\"; and\r\ndoubtless it was force and suffering which converted the Huguenots,\r\nfar more than love of the King or love of the Pope.\r\n\r\nBy all these means--forcible, threatening, insulting, and\r\nbribing--employed for the conversion of the Huguenots, the Catholics\r\nboasted that in the space of three months they had received an\r\naccession of five hundred thousand new converts to the Church of Rome.\r\n\r\nBut the \"new converts\" did not gain much by their change. They were\r\nforced to attend mass, but remained suspected. Even the dragoons who\r\nconverted them, called them dastards and deniers of their faith. They\r\ntried, if they could, to avoid confession, but confess they must.\r\nThere was the fine, confiscation of goods, and imprisonment at the\r\npriest's back.\r\n\r\nPlaces were set apart for them in the churches, where they were penned\r\nup like lepers. A person was stationed at the door with a roll of\r\ntheir names, to which they were obliged to answer. During the service,\r\nthe most prominent among them were made to carry the lights, the holy\r\nwater, the incense, and such things, which to Huguenots were an\r\nabomination. They were also required to partake of the Host, which\r\nProtestants regarded as an awful mockery of the glorious Godhead.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Saint-Simon, in his memoirs, after referring to the unmanly\r\ncruelties practised by Louis XIV. on the Huguenots, \"without the\r\nslightest pretext or necessity,\" characterizes this forced\r\nparticipation in the Eucharist as sacrilegious and blasphemous folly,\r\nnotwithstanding that nearly all the bishops lent themselves to the\r\npractice. \"From simulated abjuration,\" he says, \"they [the Huguenots]\r\nare dragged to endorse what they do not believe in, and to receive the\r\ndivine body of the Saint of saints whilst remaining persuaded that\r\nthey are only eating bread which they ought to abhor. Such is the\r\ngeneral abomination born of flattery and cruelty. From torture to\r\nabjuration, and from that to the communion, there were only\r\ntwenty-four hours' distance; and the executioners were the conductors\r\nof the converts, and their witnesses. Those who in the end appeared to\r\nhave become reconciled, when more at leisure did not fail, by their\r\nflight or their behaviour, to contradict their pretended\r\nconversion.\"[15]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 15: \"Memoirs of the Duke of Saint-Simon,\" Bayle St.\r\n         John's Translation, iii. 259.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, many of the new converts, finding life in France to be all but\r\nintolerable, determined to follow the example of the Huguenots who had\r\nalready fled, and took the first opportunity of disposing of their\r\ngoods and leaving the country. One of the first things they did on\r\nreaching a foreign soil, was to attend a congregation of their\r\nbrethren, and make \"reconnaisances,\" or acknowledgment of their\r\nrepentance for having attended mass and pretended to be converted to\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church.[16] At one of the sittings of the\r\nThreadneedle Street Huguenot Church in London, held in May, 1687--two\r\nyears after the Revocation--not fewer than 497 members were again\r\nreceived into the Church which, by force, they had pretended to\r\nabandon.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 16: See \"The Huguenots: their Settlements, &c., in\r\n         England and Ireland,\" chap. xvi.]\r\n\r\nNot many pastors abjured. A few who yielded in the first instance\r\nthrough terror and stupor, almost invariably returned to their ancient\r\nfaith. They were offered considerable pensions if they would conform\r\nand become Catholics. The King promised to augment their income by\r\none-third, and if they became advocates or doctors in law, to dispense\r\nwith their three years' study, and with the right of diploma.\r\n\r\nAt length, most of the pastors had left the country. About seven\r\nhundred had gone into Switzerland, Holland, Prussia, England, and\r\nelsewhere. A few remained going about to meetings of the peasantry, at\r\nthe daily risk of death; for every pastor taken was hung. A reward of\r\n5,500 livres was promised to whoever should take a pastor, or cause\r\nhim to be taken. The punishment of death was also pronounced against\r\nall persons who should be discovered attending such meetings.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, meetings of the Protestants continued to be held, with\r\npastors or without. They were, for the most part, held at night,\r\namidst the ruins of their pulled-down temples. But this exposed them\r\nto great danger, for spies were on the alert to inform upon them and\r\nhave them apprehended.\r\n\r\nAt length they selected more sheltered places in remote quarters,\r\nwhere they met for prayer and praise, often resorting thither from\r\ngreat distances. They were, however, often surprised, cut to pieces by\r\nthe dragoons, who hung part of the prisoners on the neighbouring\r\ntrees, and took the others to prison, from whence they were sent to\r\nthe galleys, or hung on the nearest public gibbet.\r\n\r\nFulcran Rey was one of the most celebrated of the early victims. He\r\nwas a native of Nismes, twenty-four years old. He had just completed\r\nhis theological studies; but there were neither synods to receive him\r\nto pastoral ordination, nor temples for him to preach in. The only\r\nreward he could earn by proceeding on his mission was death, yet he\r\ndetermined to preach. The first assemblies he joined were in the\r\nneighbourhood of Nismes, where his addresses were interrupted by\r\nassaults of the dragoons. The dangers to his co-religionaries were too\r\ngreat in the neighbourhood of this populous town; and he next went to\r\nCastres and the Vaunage; after which he accepted an invitation to\r\nproceed into the less populous districts of the Cevennes.\r\n\r\nHe felt the presentiment of death upon him in accepting the\r\ninvitation; but he went, leaving behind him a letter to his father,\r\nsaying that he was willing, if necessary, to give his life for the\r\ncause of truth. \"Oh! what happiness it would give me,\" he said, \"if I\r\nmight be found amongst the number of those whom the Lord has reserved\r\nto announce his praise and to die for his cause!\"\r\n\r\nHis apostolate was short but glorious. He went from village to village\r\nin the Cevennes, collected the old worshippers together, prayed and\r\npreached to them, encouraging all to suffer in the name of Christ. He\r\nremained at this work for about six weeks, when a spy who accompanied\r\nhim--one whom he had regarded as sincere a Huguenot as himself--informed\r\nagainst him for the royal reward, and delivered him over to the\r\ndragoons.\r\n\r\nRey was at first thrown into prison at Anduze, when, after a brief\r\nexamination by the local judge, he was entrusted to thirty soldiers,\r\nto be conveyed to Alais. There he was subjected to further\r\nexamination, avowing that he had preached wherever he had found\r\nfaithful people ready to hear him. At Nismes, he was told that he had\r\nbroken the law, in preaching contrary to the King's will. \"I obey the\r\nlaw of the King of kings,\" he replied; \"it is right that I should obey\r\nGod rather than man. Do with me what you will; I am ready to die.\"\r\n\r\nThe priests, the judges, and other persons of influence endeavoured to\r\ninduce him to change his opinions. Promises of great favours were\r\noffered him if he would abjure; and when the intendant Baville\r\ninformed him of the frightful death before him if he refused, he\r\nreplied, \"My life is not of value to me, provided I gain Christ.\" He\r\nremained firm. He was ordered to be put to the torture. He was still\r\nunshaken. Then he was delivered over to the executioner. \"I am\r\ntreated,\" he said, \"more mildly than my Saviour.\"\r\n\r\nOn his way to the place of execution, two monks walked by his side to\r\ninduce him to relent, and to help him to die. \"Let me alone,\" he said,\r\n\"you annoy me with your consolations.\" On coming in sight of the\r\ngallows at Beaucaire, he cried, \"Courage, courage! the end of my\r\njourney is at hand. I see before me the ladder which leads to\r\nheaven.\"\r\n\r\nThe monks wished to mount the ladder with him. \"Return,\" said he, \"I\r\nhave no need of your help. I have assistance enough from God to take\r\nthe last step of my journey.\" When he reached the upper platform, he\r\nwas about, before dying, to make public his confession of faith. But\r\nthe authorities had arranged beforehand that this should be prevented.\r\nWhen he opened his mouth, a roll of military drums muffled his voice.\r\nHis radiant look and gestures spoke for him. A few minutes more, and\r\nhe was dead; and when the paleness of death spread over his face, it\r\nstill bore the reflex of joy and peace in which he had expired. \"There\r\nis a veritable martyr,\" said many even of the Catholics who were\r\nwitnesses of his death.\r\n\r\nIt was thought that the public hanging of a pastor would put a stop to\r\nall further ministrations among the Huguenots. But the sight of the\r\nbodies of their brethren hung on the nearest trees, and the heads of\r\ntheir pastors rolling on the scaffold, did not deter them from\r\ncontinuing to hold religious meetings in solitary places, more\r\nespecially in Languedoc, Viverais, and the provinces in the south-east\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nBetween the year 1686, when Fulcran Rey was hanged at Beaucaire, and\r\nthe year 1698, when Claude Brousson was hanged at Montpellier, not\r\nfewer than seventeen pastors were publicly executed; namely, three at\r\nNismes, two at St. Hippolyte and Marsillargues in the Cevennes, and\r\ntwelve on the Peyrou at Montpellier--the public place on which\r\nProtestant Christians in the South of France were then principally\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nThere has been some discussion lately as to the massacre of the\r\nHuguenots about a century before this period. It has been held that\r\nthe St. Bartholomew Massacre was only a political squabble, begun by\r\nthe Huguenots, in which they got the worst of it. The number of\r\npersons killed on the occasion has been reduced to a very small\r\nnumber. It has been doubted whether the Pope had anything to do with\r\nthe medal struck at Rome, bearing the motto _Ugonottorum Strages_\r\n(\"Massacre of the Huguenots\"), with the Pope's head on one side, and\r\nan angel on the other pursuing and slaying a band of flying heretics.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said of the massacre of St. Bartholomew, there can be\r\nno mistake about the persecutions which preceded and followed the\r\nRevocation of the Edict of Nantes. They were continued for more than\r\nhalf a century, and had the effect of driving from France about a\r\nmillion of the best, most vigorous, and industrious of Frenchmen. In\r\nthe single province of Languedoc, not less than a hundred thousand\r\npersons (according to Boulainvilliers) were destroyed by premature\r\ndeath, one-tenth of whom perished by fire, strangulation, or the\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\nIt could not be said that Louis XIV. and the priests were destroying\r\nFrance and tearing its flesh, and that Frenchmen did not know it. The\r\nproclamations, edicts and laws published against the Huguenots were\r\nknown to all Frenchmen. Bénoît[17] gives a list of three hundred and\r\nthirty-three issued by Louis XIV. during the ten years subsequent to\r\nthe Revocation, and they were continued, as we shall find, during the\r\nsucceeding reign.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 17: \"Histoire de l'Édit de Nantes,\" par Elie\r\n         Bénoît.]\r\n\r\n\"We have,\" says M. Charles Coquerel, \"a horror of St. Bartholomew!\r\nWill foreigners believe it, that France observed a code of laws framed\r\nin the same infernal spirit, which maintained _a perpetual St.\r\nBartholomew's day in this country for about sixty years_! If they\r\ncannot call us the most barbarous of people, their judgment will be\r\nwell founded in pronouncing us the most inconsistent.\"[18]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 18: \"Histoire des Églises du Désert,\" par Charles\r\n         Coquerel, i. 498.]\r\n\r\nM. De Félice, however, will not believe that the Revocation of the\r\nEdict of Nantes was popular in France. He takes a much more patriotic\r\nview of the French people. He cannot believe them to have been\r\nwilfully guilty of the barbarities which the French Government\r\ncommitted upon the Huguenots. It was the King, the priests, and the\r\ncourtiers only! But he forgets that these upper barbarians were\r\nsupported by the soldiers and the people everywhere. He adds, however,\r\nthat if the Revocation _were_ popular, \"it would be the most\r\noverwhelming accusation against the Church of Rome, that it had thus\r\neducated and fashioned France.\"[19] There is, however, no doubt\r\nwhatever that the Jesuits, during the long period that they had the\r\nexclusive education of the country in their hands, _did_ thus fashion\r\nFrance; for, in 1793, the people educated by them treated King,\r\nJesuits, priests, and aristocracy, in precisely the same manner that\r\nthey had treated the Huguenots about a century before.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 19: De Felice's \"History of the Protestants of\r\n         France,\" book iii. sect. 17.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCLAUDE BROUSSON, THE HUGUENOT ADVOCATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo give an account in detail of the varieties of cruelty inflicted on\r\nthe Huguenots, and of the agonies to which they were subjected for\r\nmany years before and after the passing of the Act of Revocation,\r\nwould occupy too much space, besides being tedious through the mere\r\nrepetition of like horrors. But in order to condense such an account,\r\nwe think it will be more interesting if we endeavour to give a brief\r\nhistory of the state of France at that time, in connection with the\r\nbiography of one of the most celebrated Huguenots of his period, both\r\nin his life, his piety, his trials, and his endurance--that of Claude\r\nBrousson, the advocate, the pastor, and the martyr of Languedoc.\r\n\r\nClaude Brousson was born at Nismes in 1647. He was designed by his\r\nparents for the profession of the law, and prosecuted his studies at\r\nthe college of his native town, where he graduated as Doctor of Laws.\r\n\r\nHe commenced his professional career about the time when Louis XIV.\r\nbegan to issue his oppressive edicts against the Huguenots. Protestant\r\nadvocates were not yet forbidden to practise, but they already\r\nlaboured under many disabilities. He continued, however, for some time\r\nto exercise his profession, with much ability, at Castres,\r\nCastelnaudry, and Toulouse. He was frequently employed in defending\r\nProtestant pastors, and in contesting the measures for suppressing\r\ntheir congregations and levelling their churches under existing\r\nedicts, some time before the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes had\r\nbeen finally resolved upon.\r\n\r\nThus, in 1682, he was engaged in disputing the process instituted\r\nagainst the ministers and elders of the church at Nismes, with the\r\nview of obtaining an order for the demolition of the remaining\r\nProtestant temple of that city.[20] The pretext for suppressing this\r\nchurch was, that a servant girl from the country, being a Catholic,\r\nhad attended worship and received the sacrament from the hands of M.\r\nPeyrol, one of the ministers.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 20: John Locke passed through Nismes about this\r\n         time. \"The Protestants at Nismes,\" he said, \"have now but one\r\n         temple, the other being pulled down by the King's order about\r\n         four years since. The Protestants had built themselves an\r\n         hospital for the sick, but that is taken from them; a chamber\r\n         in it is left for the sick, but never used, because the\r\n         priests trouble them when there. Notwithstanding these\r\n         discouragements [this was in 1676, _before_ the Revocation],\r\n         I do not find many go over; one of them told me, when I asked\r\n         them the question, that the Papists did nothing but by force\r\n         or by money.\"--KING'S _Life of Locke_, i. 100.]\r\n\r\nBrousson defended the case, observing, at the conclusion of his\r\nspeech, that the number of Protestants was very great at Nismes; that\r\nthe ministers could not be personally acquainted with all the people,\r\nand especially with occasional visitors and strangers; that the\r\nministers were quite unacquainted with the girl, or that she professed\r\nthe Roman Catholic religion: \"facts which rendered it probable that\r\nshe was sent to the temple for the purpose of furnishing an occasion\r\nfor the prosecution.\" Sentence was for the present suspended.\r\n\r\nAnother process was instituted during the same year for the\r\nsuppression of the Protestant church at Uzes, and another for the\r\ndemolition of the large Protestant temple at Montpellier. The pretext\r\nfor destroying the latter was of a singular character.\r\n\r\nA Protestant pastor, M. Paulet, had been bribed into embracing the\r\nRoman Catholic religion, in reward for which he was appointed\r\ncounsellor to the Presidial Court of Montpellier. But his wife and one\r\nof his daughters refused to apostatize with him. The daughter, though\r\nonly between ten and eleven years old, was sent to a convent at\r\nTeirargues, where, after enduring considerable persecution, she\r\npersisted in her steadfastness, and was released after a twelvemonth's\r\nconfinement. Five years later she was again seized and sent to another\r\nconvent; but, continuing immovable against the entreaties and threats\r\nof the abbess and confessor, she was again set at liberty.\r\n\r\nAn apostate priest, however, who had many years before renounced the\r\nProtestant faith, and become director and confessor of the nuns at\r\nTeirargues, forged two documents; the one to show that while at the\r\nconvent, Mdlle. Paulet had consented to embrace the Catholic religion,\r\nand the other containing her formal abjuration. It was alleged that\r\nher abjuration had been signified to Isaac Dubourdieu, of Montpellier,\r\none of the most distinguished pastors of the French Church; but that,\r\nnevertheless, he had admitted her to the sacrament. This, if true, was\r\ncontrary to law; upon which the Catholic clergy laid information\r\nagainst the pastor and the young lady before the Parliament of\r\nToulouse, when they obtained sentence of imprisonment against the\r\nformer, and the penance of _amende honorable_ against the latter.\r\n\r\nThe demolition of temples was the usual consequence of convictions\r\nlike these. The Duc de Noailles, lieutenant-general of the province,\r\nentered the city on the 16th of October, 1682, accompanied by a strong\r\nmilitary force; and at a sitting of the Assembly of the States which\r\nshortly followed, the question of demolishing the Protestant temple at\r\nMontpellier was brought under consideration. Four of the Protestant\r\npastors and several of the elders had before waited upon De Noailles\r\nto claim a respite until they should have submitted their cause to the\r\nKing in Council.\r\n\r\nThe request having been refused, one of the deputation protested\r\nagainst the illegality of the proceedings, and had the temerity to ask\r\nhis excellency whether he was aware that there were eighteen hundred\r\nthousand Protestant families in France? Upon which the Duke, turning\r\nto the officer of his guard, said, \"Whilst we wait to see what will\r\nbecome of these eighteen hundred thousand Protestant families, will\r\nyou please conduct these gentlemen to the citadel?\"[21]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 21: When released from prison, Gaultier escaped to\r\n         Berlin and became minister of a large Protestant congregation\r\n         there. Isaac Dubourdieu escaped to England, and was appointed\r\n         one of the ministers of the Savoy Church in London.]\r\n\r\nThe great temple of Montpellier was destroyed immediately on receipt\r\nof the King's royal mandate. It required the destruction of the place\r\nwithin twenty-four hours; \"but you will give me pleasure,\" added the\r\nKing, in a letter to De Noailles, \"if you accomplish it in two.\"\r\n\r\nIt was, perhaps, scarcely necessary, after the temple had been\r\ndestroyed, to make any effort to justify these high-handed\r\nproceedings. But Mdlle. Paulet, on whose pretended conversion to\r\nCatholicism the proceedings had been instituted, was now requested to\r\nadmit the authenticity of the documents. She was still imprisoned in\r\nToulouse; and although entreated and threatened by turns to admit\r\ntheir truth, she steadfastly denied their genuineness, and asking for\r\na pen, she wrote under each of them, \"I affirm that the above\r\nsignature was not written by my hand.--Isabeau de Paulet.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the documents were forged; but they had answered their\r\npurpose. The Protestant temple of Montpellier lay in ruins, and\r\nIsabeau de Paulet was recommitted to prison. On hearing of this\r\nincident, Brousson remarked, \"This is what is called instituting a\r\nprocess against persons _after_ they have been condemned\"--a sort of\r\n\"Jedwood justice.\"\r\n\r\nThe repetition of these cases of persecution--the demolition of their\r\nchurches, and the suppression of their worship--led the Protestants of\r\nthe Cevennes, Viverais, and Dauphiny to combine for the purpose of\r\nendeavouring to stem the torrent of injustice. With this object, a\r\nmeeting of twenty-eight deputies took place in the house of Brousson,\r\nat Toulouse, in the month of May, 1683. As the Assembly of the States\r\nwere about to take steps to demolish the Protestant temple at\r\nMontauban and other towns in the south, and as Brousson was the\r\nwell-known advocate of the persecuted, the deputies were able to meet\r\nat his house to conduct their deliberations, without exciting the\r\njealousy of the priests and the vigilance of the police.\r\n\r\nWhat the meeting of Protestant deputies recommended to their brethren\r\nwas embodied in a measure, which was afterwards known as \"The\r\nProject.\" The chief objects of the project were to exhort the\r\nProtestant people to sincere conversion, and the exhibition of the\r\ngood life which such conversion implies; constant prayer to the Holy\r\nSpirit to enable them to remain steadfast in their profession and in\r\nthe reading and meditation of the Scriptures; encouragements to them\r\nto hold together as congregations for the purpose of united worship;\r\n\"submitting themselves unto the common instructions and to the yoke of\r\nChrist, in all places wheresoever He shall have established the true\r\ndiscipline, although the edicts of earthly magistrates be contrary\r\nthereto.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Brousson drew up a petition to the Sovereign, humbly\r\nrequesting him to grant permission to the Huguenots to worship God in\r\npeace after their consciences, copies of which were sent to Louvois\r\nand the other ministers of State. On this and other petitions,\r\nBrousson observes, \"Surely all the world and posterity will be\r\nsurprised, that so many respectful petitions, so many complaints of\r\ninjuries, and so many solid reasons urged for their removal, produced\r\nno good result whatever in favour of the Protestants.\"\r\n\r\nThe members of the churches which had been interdicted, and whose\r\ntemples had been demolished, were accordingly invited to assemble in\r\nprivate, in the neighbouring fields or woods--not in public places,\r\nnor around the ruins of their ancient temples--for the purpose of\r\nworshipping God, exciting each other to piety by prayer and singing,\r\nreceiving instruction, and celebrating the Lord's Supper.\r\n\r\nVarious meetings were accordingly held, in the following month of\r\nJuly, in the Cevennes and Viverais. At St. Hypolite, where the temple\r\nof the Protestants had been destroyed, about four thousand persons met\r\nin a field near the town, when the minister preached to them from the\r\ntext--\"Render unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's, and unto God\r\nthe things which are God's.\" The meeting was conducted with the utmost\r\nsolemnity; and a Catholic priest who was present, on giving\r\ninformation to the Bishop of Nismes of the transaction, admitted that\r\nthe preacher had advanced nothing but what the bishop himself might\r\nhave spoken.\r\n\r\nThe dragoons were at once sent to St. Hypolite to put an end to these\r\nmeetings, and to \"convert\" the Protestants. The town was almost wholly\r\nProtestant. The troops were quartered in numbers in every house; and\r\nthe people soon became \"new converts.\"\r\n\r\nThe losses sustained by the inhabitants of the Cevennes from this\r\nforced quartering of the troops upon them--and Anduze, Sauvé, St.\r\nGermain, Vigan, and Ganges were as full of them as St. Hypolite--may\r\nbe inferred from the items charged upon the inhabitants of St.\r\nHypolite alone[22]:--\r\n\r\n  To the regiment of Montpezat, for a billet for\r\n     sixty-five days                             50,000 livres.\r\n  To the three companies of Red Dragoons,\r\n     for ninety-five days                        30,000    \"\r\n  To three companies of Villeneuve's Dragoons,\r\n     for thirty days                              6,000    \"\r\n  To three companies of the Blue Dragoons of\r\n     Languedoc, for three months and nine days   37,000    \"\r\n  To a company of Cravates (troopers) for\r\n     fourteen days                                1,400    \"\r\n  To the transport of three hundred and nine\r\n     companies of cavalry and infantry           10,000    \"\r\n  To provisions for the troops                   60,000    \"\r\n  To damage sustained by the destruction done\r\n     by the soldiers, of furniture, and losses\r\n     by the seizure of property, &c.             50,000    \"\r\n                                               ----------\r\n                                          Total 244,400\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 22: Claude Brousson, \"Apologie du Projet des\r\n         Réformés.\"]\r\n\r\nMeetings of the persecuted were also held, under the terms of \"The\r\nProject,\" in Viverais and Dauphiny. These meetings having been\r\nrepeated for several weeks, the priests of the respective districts\r\ncalled upon their bishops for help to put down this heretical display.\r\nThe Bishop of Valence (Daniel de Cosmac) accordingly informed them\r\nthat he had taken the necessary steps, and that he had been apprised\r\nthat twenty thousand soldiers were now on their march to the South to\r\nput down the Protestant movement.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival, the troops were scattered over the country, to watch\r\nand suppress any meetings that might be held. The first took place on\r\nthe 8th of August, at Chateaudouble, a manufacturing village in Drome.\r\nThe assembly was surprised by a troop of dragoons; but most of the\r\ncongregation contrived to escape. Those who were taken were hung upon\r\nthe nearest trees.\r\n\r\nAnother meeting was held about a fortnight later at Bezaudun, which\r\nwas attended by many persons from Bourdeaux, a village about half a\r\nleague distant. While the meeting was at prayer, intelligence was\r\nbrought that the dragoons had entered Bourdeaux, and that it was a\r\nscene of general pillage. The Bourdeaux villagers at once set out for\r\nthe protection of their families. The troopers met them, and suddenly\r\nfell upon them. A few of the villagers were armed, but the principal\r\npart defended themselves with stones. Of course they were overpowered;\r\nmany were killed by the sword, and those taken prisoners were\r\nimmediately hanged.\r\n\r\nA few, who took to flight, sheltered themselves in a barn, where the\r\nsoldiers found them, set fire to the place, and murdered them as they\r\nendeavoured to escape from the flames. One young man was taken\r\nprisoner, David Chamier,[23] son of an advocate, and related to some\r\nof the most eminent Protestants in France. He was taken to the\r\nneighbouring town of Montelimar, and, after a summary trial, he was\r\ncondemned to be broken to death upon the wheel. The sentence was\r\nexecuted before his father's door; but the young man bore his\r\nfrightful tortures with astonishing courage.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 23: The grandfather of this Chamier drew up for\r\n         Henry IV. the celebrated Edict of Nantes. The greater number\r\n         of the Chamiers left France. Several were ministers in London\r\n         and Maryland, U.S. Captain Chamier is descended from the\r\n         family.]\r\n\r\nThe contumacious attitude of the Protestants after so many reports had\r\nreached Louis XIV. of their entire \"conversion,\" induced him to take\r\nmore active measures for their suppression. He appointed Marshal\r\nSaint-Ruth commander of the district--a man who was a stranger to\r\nmercy, who breathed only carnage, and who, because of his ferocity,\r\nwas known as \"The Scourge of the Heretics.\"\r\n\r\nDaniel de Cosmac, Bishop of Valence, had now the help of Saint-Ruth\r\nand his twenty thousand troops. The instructions Saint-Ruth received\r\nfrom Louvois were these: \"Amnesty has no longer any place for the\r\nViverais, who continue in rebellion after having been informed of the\r\nKing's gracious designs. In one word, you are to cause such a\r\ndesolation in that country that its example may restrain all other\r\nHuguenots, and may teach them how dangerous it is to rebel against the\r\nKing.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a work quite congenial to Saint-Ruth[24]--rushing about the\r\ncountry, scourging, slaughtering, laying waste, and suppressing the\r\nassemblies--his soldiers rushing upon their victims with cries of\r\n\"Death or the Mass!\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 24: Saint-Ruth was afterwards, in 1691, sent to\r\n         Ireland to take the command of the army fighting for James\r\n         II. against William III. There, Saint-Ruth had soldiers, many\r\n         of them Huguenots banished from France, to contend with; and\r\n         he was accordingly somewhat less successful than in Viverais,\r\n         where his opponents were mostly peasants and workmen, armed\r\n         (where armed at all) with stones picked from the roads.\r\n         Saint-Ruth and his garrison were driven from Athlone, where a\r\n         Huguenot soldier was the first to mount the breach. The army\r\n         of William III., though eight thousand fewer in number,\r\n         followed Saint-Ruth and his Irish army to the field of\r\n         Aughrim. His host was there drawn up in an almost impregnable\r\n         position--along the heights of Kilcommeden, with the Castle\r\n         of Aughrim on his left wing, a deep bog on his right, and\r\n         another bog of about two miles extending along the front, and\r\n         apparently completely protecting the Irish encampment.\r\n         Nevertheless, the English and Huguenot army under Ginckle,\r\n         bravely attacked it, forced the pass to the camp, and routed\r\n         the army of Saint-Ruth, who himself was killed by a\r\n         cannon-ball. The principal share of this victory was\r\n         attributed to the gallant conduct of the three regiments of\r\n         Huguenot horse, under the command of the Marquess de Ruvigny\r\n         (himself a banished Huguenot nobleman) who, in consequence of\r\n         his services, was raised to the Irish peerage, under the\r\n         title of Earl of Galway.]\r\n\r\nTracking the Protestants in this way was like \"a hunt in a great\r\nenclosure.\" When the soldiers found a meeting of the people going on,\r\nthey shot them down at once, though unarmed. If they were unable to\r\nfly, they met death upon their knees. Antoine Court recounts meetings\r\nin which as many as between three and four hundred persons, old men,\r\nwomen, and children, were shot dead on the spot.\r\n\r\nDe Cosmac, the bishop, was very active in the midst of these\r\nmassacres. When he went out to convert the people, he first began by\r\nsending out Saint-Ruth with the dragoons. Afterwards he himself\r\nfollowed to give instructions for their \"conversion,\" partly through\r\nfavours, partly by money. \"My efforts,\" he himself admitted, \"were not\r\nalways without success; yet I must avow that the fear of the dragoons,\r\nand of their being quartered in the houses of the heretics,\r\ncontributed much more to their conversion than anything that I did.\"\r\n\r\nThe same course was followed throughout the Cevennes. It would be a\r\nsimple record of cruelty to describe in detail the military\r\nproceedings there: the dispersion of meetings; the hanging of persons\r\nfound attending them; the breaking upon the wheel of the pastors\r\ncaptured, amidst horrible tortures; the destruction of dwellings and\r\nof the household goods which they contained. But let us take the\r\nsingle instance of Homel, formerly pastor of the church at Soyon.\r\n\r\nHomel was taken prisoner, and found guilty of preaching to his flock\r\nafter his temple had been destroyed. For this offence he was sentenced\r\nto be broken to death upon the wheel. To receive this punishment he\r\nwas conducted to Tournon, in Viverais, where the Jesuits had a\r\ncollege. He first received forty blows of the iron bar, after which he\r\nwas left to languish with his bones broken, for forty hours, until he\r\ndied. During his torments, he said: \"I count myself happy that I can\r\ndie in my Master's service. What! did my glorious Redeemer descend\r\nfrom heaven and suffer an ignominious death for my salvation, and\r\nshall I, to prolong a miserable life, deny my blessed Saviour and\r\nabandon his people?\" While his bones were being broken on the wheel,\r\nhe said to his wife: \"Farewell, once more, my beloved spouse! Though\r\nyou witness my bones broken to shivers, yet is my soul filled with\r\ninexpressible joy.\" After life was finally extinct, his heart was\r\ntaken to Chalençon to be publicly exhibited, and his body was exposed\r\nin like manner at Beauchatel.\r\n\r\nDe Noailles, the governor, when referring in one of his dispatches to\r\nthe heroism displayed by the tortured prisoners, said: \"These wretches\r\ngo to the wheel with the firm assurance of dying martyrs, and ask no\r\nother favour than that of dying quickly. They request pardon of the\r\nsoldiers, but there is not one of them that will ask pardon of the\r\nKing.\"\r\n\r\nTo return to Claude Brousson. After his eloquent defence of the\r\nHuguenots of Montauban--the result of which, of course, was that the\r\nchurch was ordered to be demolished--and the institution of processes\r\nfor the demolition of fourteen more Protestant temples, Brousson at\r\nlast became aware that the fury of the Catholics and the King was not\r\nto be satisfied until they had utterly crushed the religion which he\r\nserved.\r\n\r\nBrousson was repeatedly offered the office of counsellor of\r\nParliament, equivalent to the office of judge, if he would prove an\r\napostate; but the conscience of Brousson was not one that could be\r\nbought. He also found that his office of defender of the doomed\r\nHuguenots could not be maintained without personal danger, whilst (as\r\nevents proved) his defence was of no avail to them; and he resolved,\r\nwith much regret, to give up his profession for a time, and retire for\r\nsafety and rest to his native town of Nismes.\r\n\r\nHe resided there, however, only about four months. Saint-Ruth and De\r\nNoailles were now overawing Upper Languedoc with their troops. The\r\nProtestants of Nismes had taken no part in \"The Project;\" their\r\nremaining temple was still open. But they got up a respectful petition\r\nto the King, imploring his consideration of their case. Roman\r\nCatholics and Protestants, they said, had so many interests in common,\r\nthat the ruin of the one must have the effect of ruining the\r\nother,--the flourishing manufactures of the province, which were\r\nmostly followed by the Protestants, being now rapidly proceeding to\r\nruin. They, therefore, implored his Majesty to grant them permission\r\nto prosecute their employments unmolested on account of their\r\nreligious profession; and lastly, they conjured the King, by his\r\npiety, by his paternal clemency, and by every law of equity, to grant\r\nthem freedom of religious worship.\r\n\r\nIt was of no use. The hearts of the King, his clergy, and his\r\nministers, were all hardened against them. A copy of the above\r\npetition was presented by two ministers of Nismes and several\r\ninfluential gentlemen of Lower Languedoc to the Duke de Noailles, the\r\ngovernor of the province. He treated the deputation with contempt, and\r\ntheir petition with scorn. Writing to Louvois, the King's prime\r\nminister, De Noailles said: \"Astonished at the effrontery of these\r\nwretched persons, I did not hesitate to send them all prisoners to the\r\nCitadel of St. Esprit (in the Cevennes), telling them that if there\r\nhad been _petites maisons_[25] enough in Languedoc I should not have\r\nsent them there.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 25: The prisons of Languedoc were already crowded\r\n         with Protestants, and hundreds had been sent to the galleys\r\n         at Marseilles.]\r\n\r\nNismes was now placed under the same ban as Vivarais, and denounced as\r\n\"insurrectionary.\" To quell the pretended revolt, as well as to\r\ncapture certain persons who were supposed to have been accessory to\r\nthe framing of the petition, a detachment of four hundred dragoons was\r\nordered into the place. One of those to be apprehended was Claude\r\nBrousson. Hundreds of persons knew of his abode in the city, but\r\nnotwithstanding the public proclamation (which he himself heard from\r\nthe window of the house where he was staying), and the reward offered\r\nfor his apprehension, no one attempted to betray him.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining in the city for three days, he adopted a disguised\r\ndress, passed out of the Crown Gate, and in the course of a few days\r\nfound a safe retreat in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nPeyrol and Icard, two of the Protestant ministers whom the dragoons\r\nwere ordered to apprehend, also escaped into Switzerland, Peyrol\r\nsettling at Lausanne, and Icard becoming the minister of a Huguenot\r\nchurch in Holland. But although the ministers had escaped, all the\r\nproperty they had left behind them was confiscated to the Crown.\r\nHideous effigies of them were prepared and hung on gibbets in the\r\nmarket-place of Nismes by the public executioner, the magistrates and\r\ndragoons attending the sham proceeding with the usual ceremony.\r\n\r\nAt Lausanne, where Claude Brousson settled for a time, he first\r\nattempted to occupy himself as a lawyer; but this he shortly gave up\r\nto devote himself to the help of the persecuted Huguenots. Like Jurieu\r\nand others in Holland, who flooded Europe with accounts of the hideous\r\ncruelties of Louis XIV. and his myrmidons the clergy and dragoons, he\r\ncomposed and published a work, addressed to the Roman Catholic party\r\nas well as to the Protestants of all countries, entitled, \"The State\r\nof the Reformed Church of France.\" He afterwards composed a series of\r\nletters specially addressed to the Roman Catholic clergy of France.\r\n\r\nBut expostulation was of no use. With each succeeding year the\r\npersecution became more bitter, until at length, in 1685, the Edict\r\nwas revoked. In September of that year Brousson learnt that the\r\nProtestant church of his native city had been suppressed, and their\r\ntemple given over to a society of female converters; that the wives\r\nand daughters of the Protestants who refused to abjure their faith had\r\nbeen seized and imprisoned in nunneries and religious seminaries; and\r\nthat three hundred of their husbands and fathers were chained together\r\nand sent off in one day for confinement in the galleys at Marseilles.\r\n\r\nThe number of Huguenots resorting to Switzerland being so great,[26]\r\nand they often came so destitute, that a committee was formed at\r\nLausanne to assist the emigrants, and facilitate their settlement in\r\nthe canton, or enable them to proceed elsewhere. Brousson was from the\r\nfirst an energetic member of this committee. Part of their work was to\r\nvisit the Protestant states of the north, and find out places to which\r\nthe emigrants might be forwarded, as well as to collect subscriptions\r\nfor their conveyance.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 26: Within about three weeks no fewer than\r\n         seventeen thousand five hundred French emigrants passed into\r\n         Lausanne. Two hundred Protestant ministers fled to\r\n         Switzerland, the greater number of whom settled in Lausanne,\r\n         until they could journey elsewhere.]\r\n\r\nIn November 1685, a month after the Revocation, Brousson and La Porte\r\nset out for Berlin with this object. La Porte was one of the ministers\r\nof the Cevennes, who had fled before a sentence of death pronounced\r\nagainst him for having been concerned in \"The Project.\" At Berlin they\r\nwere received very cordially by the Elector of Brandenburg, who had\r\nalready given great assistance to the Huguenot emigrants, and\r\nexpressed himself as willing to do all that he could for their\r\nprotection. Brousson and La Porte here met the Rev. David Ancillon,\r\nwho had been for thirty-three years pastor at Metz,[27] and was now\r\npastor of the Elector at Berlin; Gaultier, banished from Montpellier;\r\nand Abbadie, banished from Saumur--all ministers of the Huguenot\r\nChurch there; with a large number of banished ministers and emigrant\r\nProtestants from all the provinces of France.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 27: Ancillon was an eminently learned man. His\r\n         library was one of the choicest that had ever been collected,\r\n         and on his expulsion from Metz it was pillaged by the\r\n         Jesuits. Metz, now part of German Lorraine, was probably not\r\n         so ferociously dragooned as other places. Yet the inhabitants\r\n         were under the apprehension that the massacre of St.\r\n         Bartholomew was about to be repeated upon them on Christmas\r\n         Day, 1685, the soldiers of the garrison having been kept\r\n         under arms all night. The Protestant churches were all pulled\r\n         down, the ministers were expelled, and many of their people\r\n         followed them into Germany. There were numerous Protestant\r\n         soldiers in the Metz garrison, and the order of the King was\r\n         that, like the rest of his subjects, they should become\r\n         converted. Many of the officers resigned and entered the\r\n         service of William of Orange, and many of the soldiers\r\n         deserted. The bribe offered for the conversion of privates\r\n         was as follows: Common soldiers and dragoons, two pistoles\r\n         per head; troopers, three pistoles per head. The Protestants\r\n         of Alsace were differently treated. They constituted a\r\n         majority of the population; Alsace and Strasbourg having only\r\n         recently been seized by Louis XIV. It was therefore necessary\r\n         to be cautious in that quarter; for violence would speedily\r\n         have raised a revolution in the province which would have\r\n         driven them over to Germany, whose language they spoke.\r\n         Louvois could therefore only proceed by bribing; and he was\r\n         successful in buying over some of the most popular and\r\n         influential men.]\r\n\r\nThe Elector suggested to Brousson that while at Berlin he should\r\ncompose a summary account of the condition of the French Protestants,\r\nsuch as should excite the interest and evoke the help of the\r\nProtestant rulers and people of the northern States. This was done by\r\nBrousson, and the volume was published, entitled \"Letters of the\r\nProtestants of France who have abandoned all for the cause of the\r\nGospel, to other Protestants; with a particular Letter addressed to\r\nProtestant Kings, Electors, Rulers, and Magistrates.\" The Elector\r\ncirculated this volume, accompanying it with a letter written in his\r\nname, to all the princes of the Continent professing the Augsburg\r\nConfession; and it was thus mainly owing to the Elector's intercession\r\nthat the Huguenots obtained the privilege of establishing\r\ncongregations in several of the states of Germany, as well as in\r\nSweden and Denmark.\r\n\r\nBrousson remained nearly five months at Berlin, after which he\r\ndeparted for Holland to note the progress of the emigration in that\r\ncountry, and there he met a large number of his countrymen. Nearly two\r\nhundred and fifty Huguenot ministers had taken refuge in Holland;\r\nthere were many merchants and manufacturers who had set up their\r\nbranches of industry in the country; and there were many soldiers who\r\nhad entered the service of William of Orange. While in Holland,\r\nBrousson resided principally with his brother, a banished Huguenot,\r\nwho had settled at Amsterdam as a merchant.\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished all that he could for his Huguenot brethren in\r\nexile, Brousson returned to Lausanne, where he continued his former\r\nlabours. He bethought him very much of the Protestants still remaining\r\nin France, wandering like sheep without shepherds, deprived of\r\nguidance, books, and worship--the prey of ravenous wolves,--and it\r\noccurred to him whether the Protestant pastors had done right in\r\nleaving their flocks, even though by so doing they had secured the\r\nsafety of their own lives. Accordingly, in 1686, he wrote and\r\npublished a \"Letter to the Pastors of France at present in Protestant\r\nStates, concerning the Desolation of their own Churches, and their own\r\nExile.\"\r\n\r\nIn this letter he says:--\"If, instead of retiring before your\r\npersecutors, you had remained in the country; if you had taken refuge\r\nin forests and caverns; if you had gone from place to place, risking\r\nyour lives to instruct and rally the people, until the first shock of\r\nthe enemy was past; and had you even courageously exposed yourselves\r\nto martyrdom--as in fact those have done who have endeavoured to\r\nperform your duties in your absence--perhaps the examples of\r\nconstancy, or zeal, or of piety you had discovered, might have\r\nanimated your flocks, revived their courage, and arrested the fury of\r\nyour enemies.\" He accordingly exhorted the Protestant ministers who\r\nhad left France to return to their flocks at all hazards.\r\n\r\nThis advice, if acted on, was virtually condemning the pastors to\r\ndeath. Brousson was not a pastor. Would _he_ like to return to France\r\nat the daily risk of the rack and the gibbet? The Protestant ministers\r\nin exile defended themselves. Bénoît, then residing in Germany,\r\nreplied in a \"History and Apology for the Retreat of the Pastors.\"\r\nAnother, who did not give his name, treated Brousson's censure as that\r\nof a fanatic, who meddled with matters beyond his vocation. \"You who\r\ncondemn the pastors for not returning to France at the risk of their\r\nlives,\" said he, \"_why do you not first return to France yourself?_\"\r\n\r\nBrousson was as brave as his words. He was not a pastor, but he might\r\nreturn to the deserted flocks, and encourage and comfort them. He\r\ncould no longer be happy in his exile at Lausanne. He heard by night\r\nthe groans of the prisoners in the Tower of Constance, and the noise\r\nof the chains borne by the galley slaves at Toulon and Marseilles. He\r\nreproached himself as if it were a crime with the repose which he\r\nenjoyed. Life became insupportable to him and he fell ill. His health\r\nwas even despaired of; but one day he suddenly rose up and said to his\r\nwife, \"I must set out; I will go to console, to relieve, to strengthen\r\nmy brethren, groaning under their oppressions.\"\r\n\r\nHis wife threw herself at his feet. \"Thou wouldst go to certain\r\ndeath,\" she said; \"think of me and thy little children.\" She implored\r\nhim again and again to remain. He loved his wife and children, but he\r\nthought a higher duty called him away from them. When his friends told\r\nhim that he would be taken prisoner and hung, he said, \"When God\r\npermits his servants to die for the Gospel, they preach louder from\r\nthe grave than they did during life.\" He remained unshaken. He would\r\ngo to the help of the oppressed with the love of a brother, the faith\r\nof an apostle, and the courage of a martyr.\r\n\r\nBrousson knew the danger of the office he was about to undertake.\r\nThere had, as we have seen, been numerous attempts made to gather the\r\nProtestant people together, and to administer consolation to them by\r\npublic prayers and preaching. The persons who conducted these services\r\nwere not regular pastors, but only private members of their former\r\nchurches. Some of them were very young men, and they were nearly all\r\nuneducated as regards clerical instruction. One of the most successful\r\nwas Isaac Vidal, a lame young man, a mechanic of Colognac, near St.\r\nHypolite, in the Cevennes. His self-imposed ministrations were\r\nattended by large numbers of people. He preached for only six months\r\nand then died--a natural death, for nearly all who followed him were\r\nfirst tortured and then hung.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to Fulcran Rey, who preached for about nine\r\nmonths, and was then executed. In the same year were executed\r\nMeyrueis, by trade a wool-carder, and Rocher, who had been a reader in\r\none of the Protestant churches. Emanuel Dalgues, a respectable\r\ninhabitant of Salle, in the Cevennes, also received the crown of\r\nmartyrdom. Ever since the Revocation of the Edict, he had proclaimed\r\nthe Gospel o'er hill and dale, in woods and caverns, to assemblies of\r\nthe people wherever he could collect them. He was executed in 1687.\r\nThree other persons--Gransille, Mercier, and Esclopier--who devoted\r\nthemselves to preaching, were transported as slaves to America; and\r\nDavid Mazel, a boy twelve years of age, who had a wonderful memory,\r\nand preached sermons which he had learned by heart, was transported,\r\nwith his father and other frequenters of the assemblies, to the\r\nCarribee Islands.\r\n\r\nAt length Brousson collected about him a number of Huguenots willing\r\nto return with him into France, in order to collect the Protestant\r\npeople together again, to pray with them, and even to preach to them\r\nif the opportunity occurred. Brousson's companions were these: Francis\r\nVivens, formerly a schoolmaster in the Cevennes; Anthony Bertezene, a\r\ncarpenter, brother of a preacher who had recently been condemned to\r\ndeath; and seven other persons named Papus, La Pierre, Serein,\r\nDombres, Poutant, Boisson, and M. de Bruc, an aged minister, who had\r\nbeen formerly pastor of one of the churches in the Cevennes. They\r\nprepared to enter France in four distinct companies, in the month of\r\nJuly, 1689.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCLAUDE BROUSSON, PASTOR AND MARTYR.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrousson left Lausanne on the 22nd of July, accompanied by his dear\r\nfriend, the Rev. M. de Bruc. The other members of the party had\r\npreceded them, crossing the frontier at different places. They all\r\narrived in safety at their destination, which was in the mountain\r\ndistrict of the Cevennes. They resorted to the neighbourhood of the\r\nAigoual, the centre of a very inaccessible region--wild, cold, but\r\nfull of recesses for hiding and worship. It was also a district\r\nsurrounded by villages, the inhabitants of which were for the most\r\npart Protestant.\r\n\r\nThe party soon became diminished in number. The old pastor, De Bruc,\r\nfound himself unequal to the fatigue and privations attending the\r\nwork. He was ill and unable to travel, and was accordingly advised by\r\nhis companions to quit the service and withdraw from the country.\r\n\r\nPersecution also destroyed some of them. When it became known that\r\nassemblies for religious observances were again on foot, an increased\r\nforce of soldiers was sent into the district, and a high price was set\r\non the heads of all the preachers that could be apprehended. The\r\nsoldiers scoured the country, and, helped by the paid spies, they\r\nshortly succeeded in apprehending Boisson and Dombres, at St. Paul's,\r\nnorth of Anduze, in the Cevennes. They were both executed at Nismes,\r\nbeing first subjected to torture on the rack, by which their limbs\r\nwere entirely dislocated. They were then conveyed to the place of\r\nexecution, praying and singing psalms on the way, and finished their\r\ncourse with courage and joy.\r\n\r\nWhen Brousson first went into the Cevennes, he did not undertake to\r\npreach to the people. He was too modest to assume the position of a\r\npastor; he merely undertook, as occasion required, to read the\r\nScriptures in Protestant families and in small companies, making his\r\nremarks and exhortations thereupon. He also transcribed portions of\r\nhis own meditations on the Scriptures, and gave them away for\r\ndistribution from hand to hand amongst the people.\r\n\r\nWhen it was found that his instructions were much appreciated, and\r\nthat numbers of people assembled to hear him read and exhort, he was\r\nstrongly urged to undertake the office of public instructor amongst\r\nthem, especially as their ministers were being constantly diminished\r\nby execution.\r\n\r\nHe had been about five months in the Cevennes, and was detained by a\r\nfall of snow on one of the mountains, where his abode was a sheepcote,\r\nwhen the proposal that he should become a preacher was first made to\r\nhim. Vivens was one of those who most strongly supported the appeal\r\nmade to Brousson. He spent many hours in private prayer, seeking the\r\napproval of God for the course he was about to undertake. Vivens also\r\nprayed in the several assemblies that Brousson might be confirmed, and\r\nthat God would be pleased to pour upon him his Holy Spirit, and\r\nstrengthen him so that he might become a faithful and successful\r\nlabourer in this great calling.\r\n\r\nBrousson at length consented, believing that duty and conscience alike\r\ncalled upon him to give the best of his help to the oppressed and\r\npersecuted Protestants of the mountains. \"Brethren,\" he said to them,\r\nwhen they called upon him to administer to them the Holy Sacrament of\r\nthe Eucharist--\"Brethren, I look above you, and hear the most High God\r\ncalling me through your mouths to this most responsible and sacred\r\noffice; and I dare not be disobedient to his heavenly call. By the\r\ngrace of God I will comply with your pious desires; dedicate and\r\ndevote myself to the work of the ministry, and spend the remainder of\r\nmy life in unwearied pains and endeavours for promoting God's glory,\r\nand the consolation of precious souls.\"\r\n\r\nBrousson received his call to the ministry in the Cevennes amidst the\r\nsound of musketry and grapeshot which spread death among the ranks of\r\nhis brethren. He was continuously tracked by the spies of the Jesuits,\r\nwho sought his apprehension and death; and he was hunted from place to\r\nplace by the troops of the King, who followed him in his wanderings\r\ninto the most wild and inaccessible places.\r\n\r\nThe perilous character of his new profession was exhibited only a few\r\ndays after his ordination, by the apprehension of Olivier Souverain at\r\nSt. Jean de Gardonenque, for preaching the Gospel to the assemblies.\r\nHe was at once conducted to Montpellier and executed on the 15th of\r\nJanuary, 1690.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year, Dumas, another preacher in the Cevennes, was\r\napprehended and fastened by the troopers across a horse in order to be\r\ncarried to Montpellier. His bowels were so injured and his body so\r\ncrushed by this horrible method of conveyance, that Dumas died before\r\nhe was half way to the customary place of martyrdom.\r\n\r\nThen followed the execution of David Quoite, a wandering and hunted\r\npastor in the Cevennes for several years. He was broken on the wheel\r\nat Montpellier, and then hanged. \"The punishment,\" said Louvreleuil,\r\nhis tormentor, \"which broke his bones, did not break his hardened\r\nheart: he died in his heresy.\" After Quoite, M. Bonnemère, a native of\r\nthe same city, was also tortured and executed in like manner on the\r\nPeyrou.\r\n\r\nAll these persons were taken, executed, destroyed, or imprisoned,\r\nduring the first year that Brousson commenced his perilous ministry in\r\nthe Cevennes.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time three women, who had gone about instructing the\r\nfamilies of the destitute Protestants, reading the Scriptures and\r\npraying with them, were apprehended by Baville, the King's intendant,\r\nand punished. Isabeau Redothière, eighteen years of age, and Marie\r\nLintarde, about a year younger, both the daughters of peasants, were\r\ntaken before Baville at Nismes.\r\n\r\n\"What! are you one of the preachers, forsooth?\" said he to Redothière.\r\n\"Sir,\" she replied, \"I have exhorted my brethren to be mindful of\r\ntheir duty towards God, and when occasion offered, I have sought God\r\nin prayer for them; and, if your lordship calls that preaching, I have\r\nbeen a preacher.\" \"But,\" said the Intendant, \"you know that the King\r\nhas forbidden this.\" \"Yes, my lord,\" she replied, \"I know it very\r\nwell, but the King of kings, the God of heaven and earth, He hath\r\ncommanded it.\" \"You deserve death,\" replied Baville.\r\n\r\nBut the Intendant awarded her a severer fate. She was condemned to be\r\nimprisoned for life in the Tower of Constance, a place echoing with\r\nthe groans of women, most of whom were in chains, perpetually\r\nimprisoned there for worshipping God according to conscience.\r\n\r\nLintarde was in like manner condemned to imprisonment for life in the\r\ncastle of Sommières, and it is believed she died there. Nothing,\r\nhowever, is known of the time when she died. When a woman was taken\r\nand imprisoned in one of the King's torture-houses, she was given up\r\nby her friends as lost.\r\n\r\nA third woman, taken at the same time, was more mercifully dealt with.\r\nAnne Montjoye was found assisting at one of the secret assemblies. She\r\nwas solicited in vain to abjure her faith, and being condemned to\r\ndeath, was publicly executed.\r\n\r\nShortly after his ordination, Brousson descended from the Upper\r\nCevennes, where the hunt for Protestants was becoming very hot, into\r\nthe adjacent valleys and plains. There it was necessary for him to be\r\nexceedingly cautious. The number of dragoons in Languedoc had been\r\nincreased so as to enable them regularly to patrol the entire\r\nprovince, and a price had been set upon Brousson's head, which was\r\ncalculated to quicken their search for the flying pastor.\r\n\r\nBrousson was usually kept informed by his Huguenot friends of the\r\ndirection taken by the dragoons in their patrols, and hasty assemblies\r\nwere summoned in their absence. The meetings were held in some secret\r\nplace--some cavern or recess in the rocks. Often they were held at\r\nnight, when a few lanterns were hung on the adjacent trees to give\r\nlight. Sentinels were set in the neighbourhood, and all the adjoining\r\nroads were watched. After the meeting was over the assemblage\r\ndispersed in different directions, and Brousson immediately left for\r\nanother district, travelling mostly by night, so as to avoid\r\ndetection. In this manner he usually presided at three or four\r\nassemblies each week, besides two on the Sabbath day--one early in the\r\nmorning and another at night.\r\n\r\nAt one of his meetings, held at Boucoiran on the Gardon, about half\r\nway between Nismes and Anduze, a Protestant nobleman--a _nouveau\r\nconvertis_, who had abjured his religion to retain his estates--was\r\npresent, and stood near the preacher during the service. One of the\r\nGovernment spies was present, and gave information. The name of the\r\nProtestant nobleman was not known. But the Intendant, to strike terror\r\ninto others, seized six of the principal landed proprietors in the\r\nneighbourhood--though some of them had never attended any of the\r\nassemblies since the Revocation--and sent two of them to the galleys,\r\nand the four others to imprisonment for life at Lyons, besides\r\nconfiscating the estates of the whole to the Crown.\r\n\r\nBrousson now felt that he was bringing his friends into very great\r\ntrouble, and, out of consideration for them, he began to think of\r\nagain leaving France. The dragoons were practising much cruelty on the\r\nProtestant population, being quartered in their houses, and at liberty\r\nto plunder and extort money to any extent. They were also incessantly\r\non the look out for the assemblies, being often led by mounted priests\r\nand spies to places where they had been informed that meetings were\r\nabout to be held. Their principal object, besides hanging the persons\r\nfound attending, was to seize the preachers, more especially Brousson\r\nand Vivens, believing that the country would be more effectually\r\n\"converted,\" provided they could be seized and got out of the way.\r\n\r\nBrousson, knowing that he might be seized and taken prisoner at any\r\nmoment, had long considered whether he ought to resist the attempts\r\nmade to capture him. He had at first carried a sword, but at length\r\nceased to wear it, being resolved entirely to cast himself on\r\nProvidence; and he also instructed all who resorted to his meetings to\r\ncome to them unarmed.\r\n\r\nIn this respect Brousson differed from Vivens, who thought it right to\r\nresist force by force; and in the event of any attempt being made to\r\ncapture him, he considered it expedient to be constantly provided with\r\narms. Yet he had only once occasion to use them, and it was the first\r\nand last time. The reward of ten thousand livres being now offered for\r\nthe apprehension of Brousson and Vivens, or five thousand for either,\r\nan active search was made throughout the province. At length the\r\nGovernment found themselves on the track of Vivens. One of his known\r\nfollowers, Valderon, having been apprehended and put upon the rack,\r\nwas driven by torture to reveal his place of concealment. A party of\r\nsoldiers went in pursuit, and found Vivens with three other persons,\r\nconcealed in a cave in the neighbourhood of Alais.\r\n\r\nVivens was engaged in prayer when the soldiers came upon him. His hand\r\nwas on his gun in a moment. When asked to surrender he replied with a\r\nshot, not knowing the number of his opponents. He followed up with two\r\nother shots, killing a man each time, and then exposing himself, he\r\nwas struck by a volley, and fell dead. The three other persons in the\r\ncave being in a position to hold the soldiers at defiance for some\r\ntime, were promised their lives if they would surrender. They did so,\r\nand with the utter want of truth, loyalty, and manliness that\r\ncharacterized the persecutors, the promise was belied, and the three\r\nprisoners were hanged, a few days after, at Alais. Vivens' body was\r\ntaken to the same place. The Intendant sat in judgment upon it, and\r\ncondemned it to be drawn through the streets upon a hurdle and then\r\nburnt to ashes.\r\n\r\nBrousson was becoming exhausted by the fatigues and privations he had\r\nencountered during his two years' wanderings and preachings in the\r\nCevennes; and he not only desired to give the people a relaxation from\r\ntheir persecution, but to give himself some absolutely necessary rest.\r\nHe accordingly proceeded to Nismes, his birthplace, where many people\r\nknew him; and where, if they betrayed him, they might easily have\r\nearned five thousand livres. But so much faith was kept by the\r\nProtestants amongst one another, that Brousson felt that his life was\r\nquite as safe amongst his townspeople as it had been during the last\r\ntwo years amongst the mountaineers of the Cevennes.\r\n\r\nIt soon became known to the priests, and then to the Intendant, that\r\nBrousson was resident in concealment at Nismes; and great efforts were\r\naccordingly made for his apprehension. During the search, a letter of\r\nBrousson's was found in the possession of M. Guion, an aged minister,\r\nwho had returned from Switzerland to resume his ministry, according as\r\nhe might find it practicable. The result of this discovery was, that\r\nGuion was apprehended, taken before the Intendant, condemned to be\r\nexecuted, and sent to Montpellier, where he gave up his life at\r\nseventy years old--the drums beating, as usual, that nobody might hear\r\nhis last words. The house in which Guion had been taken at Nismes was\r\nordered to be razed to the ground, in punishment of the owner who had\r\ngiven him shelter.\r\n\r\nAfter spending about a month at Nismes, Brousson was urged by his\r\nfriends to quit the city. He accordingly succeeded in passing through\r\nthe gates, and went to resume his former work. His first assembly was\r\nheld in a commodious place on the Gardon, between Valence, Brignon,\r\nand St. Maurice, about ten miles distant from Nismes. Although he had\r\nrequested that only the Protestants in the immediate neighbourhood\r\nshould attend the meeting, so as not to excite the apprehensions of\r\nthe authorities, yet a multitude of persons came from Uzes and Nismes,\r\naugmented by accessions from upwards of thirty villages. The service\r\nwas commenced about ten o'clock, and was not completed until midnight.\r\n\r\nThe concourse of persons from all quarters had been so great that the\r\nsoldiers could not fail to be informed of it. Accordingly they rode\r\ntowards the place of assemblage late at night, but they did not arrive\r\nuntil the meeting had been dissolved. One troop of soldiers took\r\nambush in a wood through which the worshippers would return on their\r\nway back to Uzes. The command had been given to \"draw blood from the\r\nconventicles.\" On the approach of the people the soldiers fired, and\r\nkilled and wounded several. About forty others wore taken prisoners.\r\nThe men were sent to the galleys for life, and the women were thrown\r\ninto gaol at Carcassone--the Tower of Constance being then too full of\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nAfter this event, the Government became more anxious in their desire\r\nto capture Brousson. They published far and wide their renewed offer\r\nof reward for his apprehension. They sent six fresh companies of\r\nsoldiers specially to track him, and examine the woods and search the\r\ncaves between Uzes and Alais. But Brousson's friends took care to\r\nadvise him of the approach of danger, and he sped away to take shelter\r\nin another quarter. The soldiers were, however, close upon his heels;\r\nand one morning, in attempting to enter a village for the purpose of\r\ndrying himself--having been exposed to the winter's rain and cold all\r\nnight--he suddenly came upon a detachment of soldiers! He avoided them\r\nby taking shelter in a thicket, and while there, he observed another\r\ndetachment pass in file, close to where he was concealed. The soldiers\r\nwere divided into four parties, and sent out to search in different\r\ndirections, one of them proceeding to search every house in the\r\nvillage into which Brousson had just been about to enter.\r\n\r\nThe next assembly was held at Sommières, about eight miles west of\r\nNismes. The soldiers were too late to disperse the meeting, but they\r\nwatched some of the people on their return. One of these, an old\r\nwoman, who had been observed to leave the place, was shot on entering\r\nher cottage; and the soldier, observing that she was attempting to\r\nrise, raised the butt end of his gun and brained her on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe hunted pastors of the Cevennes were falling off one by one.\r\nBernard Saint Paul, a young man, who had for some time exercised the\r\noffice of preacher, was executed in 1692. One of the brothers Du Plans\r\nwas executed in the same year, having been offered his life if he\r\nwould conform to the Catholic religion. In the following year Paul\r\nColognac was executed, after being broken to death on the wheel at\r\nMasselargais, near to which he had held his last assembly. His arms,\r\nthighs, legs, and feet were severally broken with the iron bar some\r\nhours before the _coup de grace_, or deathblow, was inflicted.\r\nColognac endured his sufferings with heroic fortitude. He was only\r\ntwenty-four. He had commenced to preach at twenty, and laboured at the\r\nwork for only four years.\r\n\r\nBrousson's health was fast giving way. Every place that he frequented\r\nwas closely watched, so that he had often to spend the night under the\r\nhollow of a rock, or under the shelter of a wood, exposed to rain and\r\nsnow,--and sometimes he had even to contend with a wolf for the\r\nshelter of a cave. Often he was almost perishing for want of food; and\r\noften he found himself nearly ready to die for want of rest. And yet,\r\neven in the midst of his greatest perils, his constant thought was of\r\nthe people committed to him, and for whose eternal happiness he\r\ncontinued to work.\r\n\r\nAs he could not visit all who wished to hear him, he wrote out sermons\r\nthat might be read to them. His friend Henry Poutant, one of those who\r\noriginally accompanied him from Switzerland and had not yet been taken\r\nprisoner by the soldiers, went about holding meetings for prayer, and\r\nreading to the people the sermons prepared for them by Brousson.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of writing out his sermons, Brousson carried about\r\nwith him a small board, which he called his \"Wilderness Table.\" With\r\nthis placed upon his knees, he wrote the sermons, for the most part in\r\nwoods and caves. He copied out seventeen of these sermons, which he\r\nsent to Louis XIV., to show him that what \"he preached in the deserts\r\ncontained nothing but the pure word of God, and that he only exhorted\r\nthe people to obey God and to give glory to Him.\"\r\n\r\nThe sermons were afterwards published at Amsterdam, in 1695, under\r\nthe title of \"The Mystic Manna of the Desert.\" One would have expected\r\nthat, under the bitter persecutions which Brousson had suffered during\r\nso many years, they would have been full of denunciation; on the\r\ncontrary, they were only full of love. His words were only burning\r\nwhen he censured his hearers for not remaining faithful to their\r\nChurch and to their God.\r\n\r\nAt length, the fury of Brousson's enemies so increased, and his health\r\nwas so much impaired, that he again thought of leaving France. His\r\nlungs were so much injured by constant exposure to cold, and his voice\r\nhad become so much impaired, that he could not preach. He also heard\r\nthat his family, whom he had left at Lausanne, required his\r\nassistance. His only son was growing up, and needed education. Perhaps\r\nBrousson had too long neglected those of his own household; though he\r\nhad every confidence in the prudence and thoughtfulness of his wife.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, about the end of 1693, Brousson made arrangements for\r\nleaving the Cevennes. He set out in the beginning of December, and\r\narrived at Lausanne about a fortnight later, having been engaged on\r\nhis extraordinary mission of duty and peril for four years and five\r\nmonths. He was received like one rescued from the dead. His health was\r\nso injured, that his wife could scarcely recognise her husband in that\r\nwan, wasted, and weatherbeaten creature who stood before her. In fact,\r\nhe was a perfect wreck.\r\n\r\nHe remained about fifteen months in Switzerland, during which he\r\npreached in the Huguenots' church; wrote out many of his pastoral\r\nletters and sermons; and, when his health had become restored, he\r\nagain proceeded on his travels into foreign countries. He first went\r\ninto Holland. He had scarcely arrived there, when intelligence reached\r\nhim from Montpellier of the execution, after barbarous torments, of\r\nhis friend Papus,--one of those who had accompanied him into the\r\nCevennes to preach the Gospel some six years before. There were now\r\nvery few of the original company left.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of the martyrdom of Papus, Brousson, in a pastoral letter\r\nwhich he addressed to his followers, said: \"He must have died some\r\nday; and as he could not have prolonged his life beyond the term\r\nappointed, how could his end have been more happy and more glorious?\r\nHis constancy, his sweetness of temper, his patience, his humility,\r\nhis faith, his hope, and his piety, affected even his judges and the\r\nfalse pastors who endeavoured to seduce him, as also the soldiers and\r\nall that witnessed his execution. He could not have preached better\r\nthan he did by his martyrdom; and I doubt not that his death, will\r\nproduce abundance of fruit.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in Holland, Brousson took the opportunity of having his sermons\r\nand many of his pastoral letters printed at Amsterdam; after which he\r\nproceeded to make a visit to his banished Huguenot friends in England.\r\nHe also wished to ascertain from personal inquiry the advisability of\r\nforwarding an increased number of French emigrants--then resident in\r\nSwitzerland--for settlement in this country. In London, he met many of\r\nhis friends from the South of France--for there were settled there as\r\nministers, Graverol of Nismes, Satur of Montauban, four ministers from\r\nMontpellier for whom he had pleaded in the courts at Toulouse--the two\r\nDubourdieus and the two Berthaus--fathers and sons. There were also La\r\nCoux from Castres, De Joux from Lyons, Roussillon from Montredon,\r\nMestayer from St. Quentin, all settled in London as ministers of\r\nHuguenot churches.\r\n\r\nAfter staying in England for only about a month, Brousson was suddenly\r\nrecalled to Holland to assume the office to which he was appointed\r\nwithout solicitation, of preacher to the Walloon church at the Hague.\r\nThough his office was easy--for he had several colleagues to assist\r\nhim in the duties--and the salary was abundant for his purposes, while\r\nhe was living in the society of his wife and family--Brousson\r\nnevertheless very soon began to be ill at ease. He still thought of\r\nthe abandoned Huguenots \"in the Desert\"; without teachers, without\r\npastors, without spiritual help of any kind. When he had undertaken\r\nthe work of the ministry, he had vowed that he would devote his time\r\nand talents to the support and help of the afflicted Church; and now\r\nhe was living at ease in a foreign country, far removed from those to\r\nwhom he considered his services belonged. These thoughts were\r\nconstantly recurring and pressing upon his mind; and at length he\r\nceased to have any rest or satisfaction in his new position.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after only about four months' connection with the Church\r\nat the Hague, Brousson decided to relinquish the charge, and to devote\r\nhimself to the service of the oppressed and afflicted members of his\r\nnative Church in France. The Dutch Government, however, having been\r\ninformed of his perilous and self-sacrificing intention, agreed to\r\ncontinue his salary as a pastor of the Walloon Church, and to pay it\r\nto his wife, who henceforth abode at the Hague.\r\n\r\nBrousson determined to enter France from the north, and to visit\r\ndistricts that were entirely new to him. For this purpose he put\r\nhimself in charge of a guide. At that time, while the Protestants\r\nwere flying from France, as they continued to do for many years, there\r\nwere numerous persons who acted as guides for those not only flying\r\nfrom, but entering the country. Those who guided Protestant pastors on\r\ntheir concealed visits to France, were men of great zeal and\r\ncourage--known to be faithful and self-denying--and thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the country. They knew all the woods, and fords, and\r\ncaves, and places of natural shelter along the route. They made the\r\nitinerary of the mountains and precipices, of the byways and deserts,\r\ntheir study. They also knew of the dwellings of the faithful in the\r\ntowns and villages where Huguenots might find relief and shelter for\r\nthe night. They studied the disguises to be assumed, and were prepared\r\nwith a stock of phrases and answers adapted for every class of\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\nThe guide employed by Brousson was one James Bruman--an old Huguenot\r\nmerchant, banished at the Revocation, and now employed in escorting\r\nHuguenot preachers back to France, and escorting flying Huguenot men,\r\nwomen, and children from it.[28] The pastor and his guide started\r\nabout the end of August, 1695. They proceeded by way of Liége; and\r\ntravelling south, they crossed the forest of Ardennes, and entered\r\nFrance near Sedan.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 28: Many of these extraordinary escapes are given\r\n         in the author's \"Huguenots: their Settlements, Churches, and\r\n         Industries, in England and Ireland.\"]\r\n\r\nSedan, recently the scene of one of the greatest calamities that has\r\never befallen France, was, about two centuries ago, a very prosperous\r\nplace. It was the seat of a great amount of Protestant learning and\r\nProtestant industry. One of the four principal Huguenot academies of\r\nFrance was situated in that town. It was suppressed in 1681, shortly\r\nbefore the Revocation, and its professors, Bayle, Abbadie, Basnage,\r\nBrazy, and Jurieu, expelled the country. The academy buildings\r\nthemselves had been given over to the Jesuits--the sworn enemies of\r\nthe Huguenots.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Sedan had been the seat of great woollen\r\nmanufactures, originally founded by Flemish Protestant families, and\r\nfor the manufacture of arms, implements of husbandry, and all kinds of\r\nsteel and iron articles.[29] At the Revocation, the Protestants packed\r\nup their tools and property, suddenly escaped across the frontier,\r\nnear which they were, and went and established themselves in the Low\r\nCountries, where they might pursue their industries in safety. Sedan\r\nwas ruined, and remained so until our own day, when it has begun to\r\nexperience a little prosperity from the tourists desirous of seeing\r\nthe place where the great French Army surrendered.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 29: There were from eighty to ninety establishments\r\n         for the manufacture of broadcloth in Sedan, giving employment\r\n         to more than two thousand persons. These, together with the\r\n         iron and steel manufactures, were entirely ruined at the\r\n         Revocation, when the whole of the Protestant mechanics went\r\n         into exile, and settled for the most part in Holland and\r\n         England.]\r\n\r\nWhen Brousson visited the place, the remaining Protestants resided\r\nchiefly in the suburban villages of Givonne and Daigny. He visited\r\nthem in their families, and also held several private meetings, after\r\nwhich he was induced to preach in a secluded place near Sedan at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThis assembly, however, was reported to the authorities, who\r\nimmediately proceeded to make search for the heretic preacher. A party\r\nof soldiers, informed by the spies, next morning invested the house in\r\nwhich Brousson slept. They first apprehended Bruman, the guide, and\r\nthought that in him they had secured the pastor. They next rummaged\r\nthe house, in order to find the preacher's books. But Brousson,\r\nhearing them coming in, hid himself behind the door, which, being\r\nsmall, hardly concealed his person.\r\n\r\nAfter setting a guard all round the house, ransacking every room in\r\nit, and turning everything upside down, they left it; but two of the\r\nchildren, seeing Brousson's feet under the door, one of them ran after\r\nthe officer of the party, and exclaimed to him, pointing back, \"Here,\r\nsir, here!\" But the officer, not understanding what the child meant,\r\nwent away with his soldiers, and Brousson's life was, for the time,\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nThe same evening, Brousson changed his disguise to that of a\r\nwool-comber, and carrying a parcel on his shoulder, he set out on the\r\nsame evening with another guide. He visited many places in which\r\nProtestants were to be found--in Champagne, Picardy, Normandy,\r\nNevernois, and Burgundy. He also visited several of his friends in the\r\nneighbourhood of Paris.\r\n\r\nWe have not many details of his perils and experiences during his\r\njourney. But the following passage is extracted from a letter\r\naddressed by him to a friend in Holland: \"I assure you that in every\r\nplace through which I passed, I witnessed the poor people truly\r\nrepenting their fault (_i.e._ of having gone to Mass), weeping day and\r\nnight, and imploring the grace and consolations of the Gospel in their\r\ndistress. Their persecutors daily oppress them, and burden them with\r\ntaxes and imposts; but the more discerning of the Roman Catholics\r\nacknowledge that the cruelties and injustice done towards so many\r\ninnocent persons, draw down misery and distress upon the kingdom. And\r\ntruly it is to be apprehended that God will abandon its inhabitants to\r\ntheir wickedness, that he may afterwards pour down his most terrible\r\njudgments upon that ungrateful and vaunting country, which has\r\nrejected his truth and despised the day of visitation.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the twelve months that Brousson was occupied with his perilous\r\njourney through France, two more of his friends in the Cevennes\r\nsuffered martyrdom--La Porte on the 7th of February, 1696, and Henri\r\nGuerin on the 22nd of June following. Both were broken alive on the\r\nwheel before receiving the _coup de grace_.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the year, Brousson arrived at Basle, from whence\r\nhe proceeded to visit his friends throughout the cantons of\r\nSwitzerland, and then he returned to Holland by way of the Rhine, to\r\nrejoin his family at the Hague.\r\n\r\nAt that time, the representatives of the Allies were meeting at\r\nRyswick the representatives of Louis XIV., who was desirous of peace.\r\nBrousson and the French refugee ministers resident in Holland\r\nendeavoured to bring the persecutions of the French Protestants under\r\nthe notice of the Conference. But Louis XIV. would not brook this\r\ninterference. He proposed going on dealing with the heretics in his\r\nown way. \"I do not pretend,\" he said, \"to prescribe to William III.\r\nrules about his subjects, and I expect the same liberty as to my own.\"\r\n\r\nFinding it impossible to obtain redress for his fellow-countrymen\r\nunder the treaty of Ryswick, which was shortly after concluded,\r\nBrousson at length prepared to make his third journey into France in\r\nthe month of August 1697. He set out greatly to the regret of his\r\nwife, who feared it might be his last journey, as indeed it proved to\r\nbe. In a letter which he wrote to console her, from some remote place\r\nwhere he was snowed up about the middle of the following December, he\r\nsaid: \"I cannot at present enter into the details of the work the\r\nLord has given me grace to labour in; but it is the source of much\r\nconsolation to a large number of his poor people. It will be expedient\r\nthat you do not mention where I am, lest I should be traced. It may be\r\nthat I cannot for some time write to you; but I walk under the conduct\r\nof my God, and I repeat that I would not for millions of money that\r\nthe Lord should refuse me the grace which renders it imperative for me\r\nto labour as I now do in His work.\"[30]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 30: The following was the portraiture of Brousson,\r\n         issued to the spies and police: \"Brousson is of middle\r\n         stature, and rather spare, aged forty to forty-two, nose\r\n         large, complexion dark, hair black, hands well formed.\"]\r\n\r\nWhen the snow had melted sufficiently to enable Brousson to escape\r\nfrom the district of Dauphiny, near the High Alps, where he had been\r\nconcealed, he made his way across the country to the Viverais, where\r\nhe laboured for some time. Here he heard of the martyrdom of the third\r\nof the brothers Du Plans, broken on the wheel and executed like the\r\nothers on the Peyrou at Montpellier.\r\n\r\nDuring the next nine months, Brousson laboured in the north-eastern\r\nprovinces of Languedoc (more particularly in the Cevennes and\r\nViverais), Orange, and Dauphiny. He excited so much interest amongst\r\nthe Protestants, who resorted from a great distance to attend his\r\nassemblies, that the spies (who were usually pretended Protestants)\r\nsoon knew of his presence in the neighbourhood, and information was at\r\nonce forwarded to the Intendant or his officers.\r\n\r\nPersecution was growing very bitter about this time. By orders of the\r\nbishops the Protestants were led by force to Mass before the dragoons\r\nwith drawn swords, and the shops of merchants who refused to go to\r\nMass regularly were ordered to be closed. Their houses were also\r\nfilled with soldiers. \"The soldiers or militia,\" said Brousson to a\r\nfriend in Holland, \"frequently commit horrible ravages, breaking open\r\nthe cabinets, removing every article that is saleable, which are often\r\npurchased by the priests at insignificant prices; the rest they burn\r\nand break up, after which the soldiers are removed; and when the\r\nsufferers think themselves restored to peace, fresh billets are\r\nordered upon them. Many are consequently induced to go to Mass with\r\nweeping and lamentation, but a great number remain inflexible, and\r\nothers fly the kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it became known that Brousson, in the course of his journeyings,\r\nhad arrived, about the end of August, 1698, in the neighbourhood of\r\nNismes, Baville was greatly mortified; and he at once offered a reward\r\nof six hundred louis d'or for his head. Brousson nevertheless entered\r\nNismes, and found refuge amongst his friends. He had, however, the\r\nimprudence to post there a petition to the King, signed by his own\r\nhand, which had the effect of at once setting the spies upon his\r\ntrack. Leaving the city itself, he took refuge in a house not far from\r\nit, whither the spies contrived to trace him, and gave the requisite\r\ninformation to the Intendant. The house was soon after surrounded by\r\nsoldiers, and was itself entered and completely searched.\r\n\r\nBrousson's host had only had time to make him descend into a well,\r\nwhich had a niche in the bottom in which he could conceal himself. The\r\nsoldiers looked down the well a dozen times, but could see nothing.\r\nBrousson was not in the house; he was not in the chimneys; he was not\r\nin the outhouses. He _must_ be in the well! A soldier went down the\r\nwell to make a personal examination. He was let down close to the\r\nsurface of the water, and felt all about. There was nothing! Feeling\r\nawfully cold, and wishing to be taken out, he called to his friends,\r\n\"There is nothing here, pull me up.\" He was pulled up accordingly, and\r\nBrousson was again saved.\r\n\r\nThe country about Nismes being beset with spies to track the\r\nProtestants and prevent their meetings, Brousson determined to go\r\nwestward and visit the scattered people in Rouerge, Pays de Foix, and\r\nBigorre, proceeding as far as Bearn, where a remnant of Huguenots\r\nstill lingered, notwithstanding the repeated dragooning to which the\r\ndistrict had been subjected. It was at Oberon that he fell into the\r\nhands of a spy, who bore the same name as a Protestant friend to whom\r\nhis letter was addressed. Information was given to the authorities,\r\nand Brousson was arrested. He made no resistance, and answered at once\r\nto his name.\r\n\r\nWhen the Judas who had betrayed him went to M. Pénon, the intendant of\r\nthe province, to demand the reward set upon Brousson's head, the\r\nIntendant replied with indignation, \"Wretch! don't you blush to look\r\nupon the man in whose blood you traffic? Begone! I cannot bear your\r\npresence!\"\r\n\r\nBrousson was sent to Pau, where he was imprisoned in the castle of\r\nFoix, at one time the centre of the Reformation movement in the South\r\nof France--where Calvin had preached, where Jeanne d'Albret had lived,\r\nand where Henry IV. had been born.\r\n\r\nFrom Pau, Brousson was sent to Montpellier, escorted by dragoons. At\r\nToulouse the party took passage by the canal of Languedoc, which had\r\nthen been shortly open. At Somail, during the night, Brousson saw that\r\nall the soldiers were asleep. He had but to step on shore to regain\r\nhis liberty; but he had promised to the Intendant of Bearn, who had\r\nallowed him to go unfettered, that he would not attempt to escape. At\r\nAgade there was a detachment of a hundred soldiers, ready to convey\r\nthe prisoner to Baville, Intendant of Languedoc. He was imprisoned in\r\nthe citadel of Montpellier, on the 30th October, 1698.\r\n\r\nBaville, who knew much of the character of Brousson--his peacefulness,\r\nhis piety, his self-sacrifice, and his noble magnanimity--is said to\r\nhave observed on one occasion, \"I would not for a world have to judge\r\nthat man.\" And yet the time had now arrived when Brousson was to be\r\njudged and condemned by Baville and the Presidial Court. The trial was\r\na farce, because it had been predetermined that Brousson should die.\r\nHe was charged with preaching in France contrary to the King's\r\nprohibition. This he admitted; but when asked to whom he had\r\nadministered the Sacrament, he positively refused to disclose, because\r\nhe was neither a traitor nor informer to accuse his brethren. He was\r\nalso charged with having conspired to introduce a foreign army into\r\nFrance under the command of Marshal Schomberg. This he declared to be\r\nabsolutely false, for he had throughout his career been a man of\r\npeace, and sought to bring back Christ's followers by peaceful means\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nHis defence was of no avail. He was condemned to be racked, then to be\r\nbroken on the wheel, and afterwards to be executed. He received the\r\nsentence without a shudder. He was tied on the rack, but when he\r\nrefused to accuse his brethren he was released from it. Attempts were\r\nmade by several priests and friars to add him to the number of \"new\r\nconverts,\" but these were altogether fruitless. All that remained was\r\nto execute him finally on the public place of execution--the Peyrou.\r\n\r\nThe Peyrou is the pride of modern Montpellier. It is the favourite\r\npromenade of the place, and is one of the finest in Europe. It\r\nconsists of a broad platform elevated high above the rest of the town,\r\nand commanding extensive views of the surrounding country. In clear\r\nweather, Mont Ventoux, one of the Alpine summits, may be seen across\r\nthe broad valley of the Rhône on the east, and the peak of Mont\r\nCanizou in the Pyrenees on the west. Northward stretches the mountain\r\nrange of the Cevennes, the bold Pic de Saint-Loup the advanced\r\nsentinel of the group; while in the south the prospect is bounded by\r\nthe blue line of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe Peyrou is now pleasantly laid out in terraced walks and shady\r\ngroves, with gay parterres of flowers--the upper platform being\r\nsurrounded with a handsome stone balustrade. An equestrian statue of\r\nLouis XIV. occupies the centre of the area; and a triumphal arch\r\nstands at the entrance to the promenade, erected to commemorate the\r\n\"glories\" of the same monarch, more particularly the Revocation by him\r\nof the Edict of Nantes--one of the entablatures of the arch displaying\r\na hideous figure, intended to represent a Huguenot, lying trampled\r\nunder foot of the \"Most Christian King.\"\r\n\r\nThe Peyrou was thus laid out and ornamented in the reign of his\r\nsuccessor, Louis XV., \"the Well-beloved,\" during which the same policy\r\nfor which Louis XIV. was here glorified by an equestrian statue and a\r\ntriumphal arch continued to be persevered in--of imprisoning,\r\nbanishing, hanging, or sending to the galleys such of the citizens of\r\nFrance as were not of \"the King's religion.\"\r\n\r\nBut during the reign of Louis XIV. himself, the Peyrou was anything\r\nbut a pleasure-ground. It was the infamous place of the city--the\r\n_place de Grève_--a desert, barren, blasted table-land, where\r\nsometimes half-a-dozen decaying corpses might be seen swinging from\r\nthe gibbets on which they had been hung. It was specially reserved,\r\nbecause of its infamy, for the execution of heretics against Rome; and\r\nhere, accordingly, hundreds of Huguenot martyrs--whom power, honour,\r\nand wealth failed to bribe or to convert--were called upon to seal\r\ntheir faith with their blood.\r\n\r\nBrousson was executed at this place on the 4th of November, 1698. It\r\nwas towards evening, while the sun was slowly sinking behind the\r\nwestern mountains, that an immense multitude assembled on the Peyrou\r\nto witness the martyrdom of the devoted pastor. Not fewer than twenty\r\nthousand persons were there, including the principal nobility of the\r\ncity and province, besides many inhabitants of the adjoining mountain\r\ndistrict of the Cevennes, some of whom had come from a great distance\r\nto be present. In the centre of the plateau, near where the equestrian\r\nstatue of the great King now stands, was a scaffold, strongly\r\nsurrounded by troops to keep off the crowd. Two battalions, drawn up\r\nin two lines facing each other, formed an avenue of bayonets between\r\nthe citadel, near at hand, and the place of execution.\r\n\r\nA commotion stirred the throng; and the object of the breathless\r\ninterest excited shortly appeared in the person of a middle-sized,\r\nmiddle-aged man, spare, grave, and dignified in appearance, dressed in\r\nthe ordinary garb of a pastor, who walked slowly towards the\r\nscaffold, engaged in earnest prayer, his eyes and hands lifted towards\r\nheaven. On mounting the platform, he stood forward to say a few last\r\nwords to the people, and give to many of his friends, whom he knew to\r\nbe in the crowd, his parting benediction. But his voice was instantly\r\nstifled by the roll of twenty drums, which continued to beat a quick\r\nmarch until the hideous ceremony was over, and the martyr, Claude\r\nBrousson, had ceased to live.[31]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 31: The only favour which Brousson's judges showed\r\n         him at death was as regarded the manner of carrying his\r\n         sentence into execution. He was condemned to be broken alive\r\n         on the wheel, and then strangled; whereas by special favour\r\n         the sentence was commuted into strangulation first and the\r\n         breaking of his bones afterwards. So that while Brousson's\r\n         impassive body remained with his persecutors to be broken,\r\n         his pure unconquered spirit mounted in triumph towards\r\n         heaven.]\r\n\r\nStrange are the vicissitudes of human affairs! Not a hundred years\r\npassed after this event, before the great grandson of the monarch, at\r\nwhose instance Brousson had laid down his life, appeared upon a\r\nscaffold in the Place Louis XIV. in Paris, and implored permission to\r\nsay his few last words to the people. In vain! His voice was drowned\r\nby the drums of Santerre!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nOUTBREAK IN LANGUEDOC.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the arbitrary measures of the King were felt all over France,\r\nthey nowhere excited more dismay and consternation than in the\r\nprovince of Languedoc. This province had always been inhabited by a\r\nspirited and energetic people, born lovers of liberty. They were among\r\nthe earliest to call in question the despotic authority over mind and\r\nconscience claimed by the see of Rome. The country is sown with the\r\nashes of martyrs. Long before the execution of Brousson, the Peyrou at\r\nMontpellier had been the Calvary of the South of France.\r\n\r\nAs early as the twelfth century, the Albigenses, who inhabited the\r\ndistrict, excited the wrath of the Popes. Simple, sincere believers in\r\nthe Divine providence, they rejected Rome, and took their stand upon\r\nthe individual responsibility of man to God. Count de Foix said to the\r\nlegate of Innocent III.: \"As to my religion, the Pope has nothing to\r\ndo with it. Every man's conscience must be free. My father has always\r\nrecommended to me this liberty, and I am content to die for it.\"\r\n\r\nA crusade was waged against the Albigenses, which lasted for a period\r\nof about sixty years. Armies were concentrated upon Languedoc, and\r\nafter great slaughter the heretics were supposed to be exterminated.\r\n\r\nBut enough of the people survived to perpetuate the love of liberty in\r\ntheir descendants, who continued to exercise a degree of independence\r\nin matters of religion and politics almost unknown in other parts of\r\nFrance. Languedoc was the principal stronghold of the Huguenots in the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries; and when, in 1685, Louis XIV.\r\nrevoked the Edict of Nantes, which interdicted freedom of worship\r\nunder penalty of confiscation, banishment, and death, it is not\r\nsurprising that such a policy should have occasioned widespread\r\nconsternation, if not hostility and open resistance.\r\n\r\nAt the period of the Revocation there were, according to the Intendant\r\nof the province, not fewer than 250,000 Protestants in Languedoc, and\r\nthese formed the most skilled, industrious, enterprising, and wealthy\r\nportion of the community. They were the best farmers, vine-dressers,\r\nmanufacturers, and traders. The valley of Vaunage, lying to the\r\nwestward of Nismes, was one of the richest and most highly cultivated\r\nparts of France. It contained more than sixty temples, its population\r\nbeing almost exclusively Protestant; and it was known as \"The Little\r\nCanaan,\" abounding as it did in corn, and wine, and oil.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the commerce of the South of France was conducted\r\nby the Protestant merchants of Nismes, of whom the Intendant wrote to\r\nthe King in 1699, \"If they are still bad Catholics, at any rate they\r\nhave not ceased to be very good traders.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquis d'Aguesseau bore similar testimony to the intelligent\r\nindustry of the Huguenot population. \"By an unfortunate fatality,\"\r\nsaid he, \"in nearly every kind of art the most skilful workmen, as\r\nwell as the richest merchants, belong to the pretended reformed\r\nreligion.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquis, who governed Languedoc for many years, was further of\r\nopinion that the intelligence of the Protestants was in a great\r\nmeasure due to the instructions of their pastors. \"It is certain,\"\r\nsaid he, \"that one of the things which holds the Huguenots to their\r\nreligion is the amount of information which they receive from their\r\ninstructors, and which it is not thought necessary to give in ours.\r\nThe Huguenots _will_ be instructed, and it is a general complaint\r\namongst the new converts not to find in our religion the same mental\r\nand moral discipline they find in their own.\"\r\n\r\nBaville, the intendant, made an observation to a similar effect in a\r\nconfidential communication which he made to the authorities at Paris\r\nin 1697, in which he boasted that the Protestants had now all been\r\nconverted, and that there were 198,483 new converts in Languedoc.\r\n\"Generally speaking,\" he said, \"the new converts are much better off,\r\nbeing more laborious and industrious than the old Catholics of the\r\nprovince. The new converts must not be regarded as Catholics; they\r\nalmost all preserve in their heart their attachment to their former\r\nreligion. They may confess and communicate as much as you will,\r\nbecause they are menaced and forced to do so by the secular power. But\r\nthis only leads to sacrilege. To gain them, _their hearts must be\r\nwon_. It is there that religion resides, and it can only be solely\r\nestablished by effecting that conquest.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the number, as well as the wealth and education, of the\r\nProtestants of Languedoc, it is reasonable to suppose that the\r\nemigration from this quarter of France should have been very\r\nconsiderable during the persecutions which followed the Revocation. Of\r\ncourse nearly all the pastors fled, death being their punishment if\r\nthey remained in France. Hence many of the most celebrated French\r\npreachers in Holland, Germany, and England were pastors banished from\r\nLanguedoc. Claude and Saurin both belonged to the province; and among\r\nthe London preachers were the Dubourdieus, the Bertheaus, Graverol,\r\nand Pégorier.\r\n\r\nIt is also interesting to find how many of the distinguished Huguenots\r\nwho settled in England came from Languedoc. The Romillys and Layards\r\ncame from Montpellier; the Saurins from Nismes; the Gaussens from\r\nLunel; and the Bosanquets from Caila;[32] besides the Auriols,\r\nArnauds, Péchels, De Beauvoirs, Durands, Portals, Boileaus, D'Albiacs,\r\nD'Oliers, Rious, and Vignoles, all of whom belonged to the Huguenot\r\nlanded gentry of Languedoc, who fled and sacrificed everything rather\r\nthan conform to the religion of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 32: There are still Gaussens at St. Mamert, in the\r\n         department of Gard; and some of the Bosanquet family must\r\n         have remained on their estates or returned to Protestantism,\r\n         as we find a Bosanquet of Caila broken alive at Nismes,\r\n         because of his religion, on the 7th September, 1702, after\r\n         which his corpse was publicly exposed on the Montpellier high\r\n         road.]\r\n\r\nWhen Brousson was executed at Montpellier, it was believed that\r\nProtestantism was finally dead. At all events, it was supposed that\r\nthose of the Protestants who remained, without becoming converted,\r\nwere at length reduced to utter powerlessness. It was not believed\r\nthat the smouldering ashes contained any sparks that might yet be\r\nfanned into flames. The Huguenot landed proprietors, the principal\r\nmanufacturers, the best of the artisans, had left for other countries.\r\nProtestantism was now entirely without leaders. The very existence of\r\nProtestantism in any form was denied by the law; and it might perhaps\r\nreasonably have been expected that, being thus crushed out of sight,\r\nit would die.\r\n\r\nBut there still remained another important and vital element--the\r\ncommon people--the peasants, the small farmers, the artisans, and\r\nlabouring classes--persons of slender means, for the most part too\r\npoor to emigrate, and who remained, as it were, rooted to the soil on\r\nwhich they had been born. This was especially the case in the\r\nCevennes, where, in many of the communes, almost the entire\r\ninhabitants were Protestants; in others, they formed a large\r\nproportion of the population; while in all the larger towns and\r\nvillages they were very numerous, as well as widely spread over the\r\nwhole province.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mountainous district of the Cevennes is the most rugged, broken,\r\nand elevated region in the South of France. It fills the department of\r\nLozère, as well as the greater part of Gard and Herault. The principal\r\nmountain-chain, about a hundred leagues in length, runs from\r\nnorth-east to south-west, and may almost be said to unite the Alps\r\nwith the Pyrenees. From the centre of France the surface rises with a\r\ngradual slope, forming an inclined plane, which reaches its greatest\r\nheight in the Cevennic chain, several of the summits of which are\r\nabout five thousand five hundred feet above the sea level. Its\r\nconnection with the Alpine range is, however, broken abruptly by the\r\ndeep valley of the Rhône, running nearly due north and south.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this mountain district maybe regarded as a triangular\r\nplateau rising gradually from the northwest, and tilted up at its\r\nsouth-eastern angle. It is composed for the most part of granite,\r\noverlapped by strata belonging to the Jurassic-system; and in many\r\nplaces, especially in Auvergne, the granitic rocks have been burst\r\nthrough by volcanoes, long since extinct, which rise like enormous\r\nprotuberances from the higher parts of the platform. Towards the\r\nsouthern border of the district, the limestone strata overlapping the\r\ngranite assume a remarkable development, exhibiting a series of\r\nflat-topped hills bounded by perpendicular cliffs some six or eight\r\nhundred feet high.\r\n\r\n\"These plateaux,\" says Mr. Scrope, in his interesting account of the\r\ngeology of Central France, \"are called 'causses' in the provincial\r\ndialect, and they have a singularly dreary and desert aspect from the\r\nmonotony of their form and their barren and rocky character. The\r\nvalleys which separate them are rarely of considerable width. Winding,\r\nnarrow, and all but impassable cliff-like glens predominate, giving to\r\nthe Cevennes that peculiarly intricate character which enabled its\r\nProtestant inhabitants, in the beginning of the last century, to offer\r\nso stubborn and gallant a resistance to the atrocious persecutions of\r\nLouis XIV.\"\r\n\r\nSuch being the character of this mountain district--rocky, elevated,\r\nand sterile--the people inhabiting it, though exceedingly industrious,\r\nare for the most very poor. Sheep-farming is the principal occupation\r\nof the people of the hill country; and in the summer season, when the\r\nlower districts are parched with drought, tens of thousands of sheep\r\nmay be seen covering the roads leading to the Upper Cevennes, whither\r\nthey are driven for pasture. There is a comparatively small breadth of\r\narable land in the district. The mountains in many places contain only\r\nsoil enough to grow juniper-bushes. There is very little verdure to\r\nrelieve the eye--few turf-clad slopes or earth-covered ledges to\r\nrepay the tillage of the farmer. Even the mountains of lower elevation\r\nare for the most part stony deserts. Chestnut-trees, it is true, grow\r\nluxuriantly in the sheltered places, and occasionally scanty crops of\r\nrye on the lower mountain-sides. Mulberry-trees also thrive in the\r\nvalleys, their leaves being used for the feeding of silkworms, the\r\nrearing of which forms one of the principal industries of the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nEven in the immediate neighbourhood of Nismes--a rich and beautiful\r\ntown, abounding in Roman remains, which exhibit ample evidences of its\r\nancient grandeur--the country is arid, stony, and barren-looking,\r\nthough here the vine, the olive, and the fig-tree, wherever there is\r\nsoil enough, grow luxuriantly in the open air. Indeed, the country\r\nvery much resembles in its character the land of Judea, being rocky,\r\nparched, and in many places waste, though in others abounding in corn\r\nand wine and oil. In the interior parts of the district the scenery is\r\nwild and grand, especially in the valleys lying under the lofty\r\nmountain of Lozère. But the rocks and stones are everywhere in the\r\nascendant.\r\n\r\nA few years ago we visited the district; and while proceeding in the\r\nold-fashioned diligence which runs between Alais and Florac--for the\r\ndistrict is altogether beyond the reach of railways--a French\r\ncontractor, accompanying a band of Italian miners, whom he was taking\r\ninto the mountains to search for minerals, pointing to the sterile\r\nrocks, exclaimed to us, \"Messieurs, behold the very poorest district\r\nin France! It contains nothing but juniper-bushes! As for its\r\nagriculture, it produces nothing; manufactures, nothing; commerce,\r\nnothing! _Rien, rien, rien!_\"\r\n\r\nThe observation of this French _entrepreneur_ reminds us of an\r\nanecdote that Telford, the Scotch engineer, used to relate of a\r\ncountryman with reference to his appreciation of Scotch mountain\r\nbeauty. An English artist, enraptured by the scenery of Ben MacDhui,\r\nwas expatiating on its magnificence, and appealed to the native guide\r\nfor confirmation of his news. \"I dinna ken aboot the scenery,\" replied\r\nthe man, \"but there's plenty o' big rocks and stanes; an' the kintra's\r\nawfu' puir.\" The same observation might doubtless apply to the\r\nCevennes. Yet, though the people may be poor, they are not miserable\r\nor destitute, for they are all well-clad and respectable-looking\r\npeasants, and there is not a beggar to be seen in the district.\r\n\r\nBut the one country, as the other, grows strong and brave men. These\r\nbarren mountain districts of the Cevennes have bred a race of heroes;\r\nand the men are as simple and kind as they are brave. Hospitality is a\r\ncharacteristic of the people, which never fails to strike the visitor\r\naccustomed to the exactions which are so common along the hackneyed\r\ntourist routes.\r\n\r\nAs in other parts of France, the peasantry here are laborious almost\r\nto excess. Robust and hardy, they are distinguished for their\r\nperseverance against the obstacles which nature constantly opposes to\r\nthem. Out-door industry being suspended in winter, during which they\r\nare shut up in their cabins for nearly six months by the ice and snow,\r\nthey occupy themselves in preparing their wool for manufacture into\r\ncloth. The women card, the children spin, the men weave; and each\r\ncottage is a little manufactory of drugget and serge, which is taken\r\nto market in spring, and sold in the low-country towns. Such was the\r\nindustry of the Cevennes nearly two hundred years since, and such it\r\nremains to the present day.\r\n\r\nThe people are of a contented nature, and bear their poverty with\r\ncheerfulness and even dignity. While they partake of the ardour and\r\nstrong temper which characterize the inhabitants of the South of\r\nFrance, they are probably, on the whole, more grave and staid than\r\nFrenchmen generally, and are thought to be more urbane and\r\nintelligent; and though they are unmanageable by force, they are\r\nremarkably accessible to kindness and moral suasion.\r\n\r\nSuch, in a few words, are the more prominent characteristics of the\r\ncountry and people of the Cevennes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the popular worship of the mountain district of Languedoc--in\r\nwhich the Protestants constituted the majority of the population--was\r\nsuppressed, great dismay fell upon the people; but they made no signs\r\nof resistance to the royal authority. For a time they remained\r\ncomparatively passive, and it was at first thought they were\r\nindifferent. Their astonished enemies derisively spoke of them as\r\ndisplaying \"the patience of a Huguenot,\"--the words having passed into\r\na proverb.\r\n\r\nBut their persecutors did not know the stuff of which these\r\nmountaineers were made. They had seen their temples demolished one\r\nafter another, and their pastors banished, leaving them \"like poor\r\nstarved sheep looking for the pasture of life.\" Next they heard that\r\nsuch of their pastors as had been apprehended for venturing to\r\nminister to them in \"the Desert\" had been taken to Nismes and\r\nMontpellier and hanged. Then they began to feel excited and indignant.\r\nFor they could not shake off their own belief and embrace another\r\nman's, even though that man was their king. If Louis XIV. had ordered\r\nthem to believe that two and two make six, they could not possibly\r\nbelieve, though they might pretend to do so, that it made any other\r\nnumber than four. And so it was with the King's order to them to\r\nprofess a faith which they could not bring their minds to believe in.\r\n\r\nThese poor people entertained the conviction that they possessed\r\ncertain paramount rights as men. Of these they held the right of\r\nconscience to be one of the principal. They were willing to give unto\r\nCæsar the things that were Cæsar's; but they could not give him those\r\nwhich belonged unto God. And if they were forced to make a choice,\r\nthen they must rather disobey their King than the King of kings.\r\n\r\nThough deprived of their leaders and pastors, the dispossessed\r\nHuguenots emerged by degrees from their obscurity, and began to\r\nrecognise each other openly. If their temples were destroyed, there\r\nremained the woods and fields and mountain pastures, where they might\r\nstill meet and worship God, even though it were in defiance of the\r\nlaw. Having taken counsel together, they resolved \"not to forsake the\r\nassembling of themselves together;\" and they proceeded, in all the\r\nProtestant districts in the South of France--in Viverais, Dauphiny,\r\nand the Cevennes--to hold meetings of the people, mostly by night, for\r\nworship--in woods, in caves, in rocky gorges, and in hollows of the\r\nhills. Then began those famous assemblies of \"the Desert,\" which were\r\nthe nightmare of Louvois and the horror of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to the knowledge of the authorities that such meetings\r\nwere being held, large bodies of troops were sent into the southern\r\nprovinces, with orders to disperse them and apprehend the ringleaders.\r\nThese orders were carried out with much barbarity. Amongst various\r\nassemblies which were discovered and attacked in the Cevennes, were\r\nthose of Auduze and Vigan, where the soldiers fell upon the\r\ndefenceless people, put the greater number to the sword, and hanged\r\nupon the nearest trees those who did not succeed in making their\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nThe authorities waited to see the effect of these \"vigorous measures;\"\r\nbut they were egregiously disappointed. The meetings in the Desert\r\nwent on as before, and even increased in number. Then milder means\r\nwere tried. Other meetings were attacked in like manner, and the\r\npeople found attending them taken prisoners. They were then threatened\r\nwith death unless they became converted, and promised to attend Mass.\r\nThey declared that they preferred death. A passion for martyrdom even\r\nseemed to be spreading amongst the infatuated people!\r\n\r\nThen the peasantry began secretly to take up arms for their defence.\r\nThey had thus far been passive in their resistance, and were content\r\nto brave death provided they could but worship together. At length\r\nthey felt themselves driven in their despair to resist force by\r\nforce--acting, however, in the first place, entirely on the\r\ndefensive--\"leaving the issue,\" to use the words of one of their\r\nsolemn declarations, \"to the providence of God.\"\r\n\r\nThey began--these poor labourers, herdsmen, and wool-carders--by\r\ninstituting a common fund for the purpose of helping their distressed\r\nbrethren in surrounding districts. They then invited such as were\r\ndisposed to join them to form themselves into companies, so as to be\r\nprepared to come together and give their assistance as occasion\r\nrequired. When meetings in the Desert were held, it became the duty of\r\nthese enrolled men to post themselves as sentinels on the surrounding\r\nheights, and give notice of the approach of their enemies. They also\r\nconstituted a sort of voluntary police for their respective districts,\r\ntaking notice of the changes of the royal troops, and dispatching\r\ninformation by trusty emissaries, intimating the direction of their\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nThe Intendant, Baville, wrote to Louvois, minister of Louis XIV.\r\nduring the persecutions, expressing his surprise and alarm at the\r\napparent evidences of organization amongst the peasantry. \"I have just\r\nlearned,\" said he in one letter,[33] \"that last Sunday there was an\r\nassembly of nearly four hundred men, many of them armed, at the foot\r\nof the mountain of Lozère. I had thought,\" he added, \"that the great\r\nlesson taught them at Vigan and Anduze would have restored\r\ntranquillity to the Cevennes, at least for a time. But, on the\r\ncontrary, the severity of the measures heretofore adopted seems only\r\nto have had the effect of exasperating and hardening them in their\r\niniquitous courses.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 33: October 20, 1686.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the massacres had failed, the question next arose whether the\r\ninhabitants might not be driven into exile, and the country entirely\r\ncleared of them. \"They pretend,\" said Louvois, \"to meet in 'the\r\nDesert;' why not take them at their word, and make the Cevennes\r\n_really_ a Desert?\" But there were difficulties in the way of\r\nexecuting this plan. In the first place, the Protestants of Languedoc\r\nwere a quarter of a million in number. And, besides, if they were\r\ndriven out of it, what would become of the industry and the wealth of\r\nthis great province--what of the King's taxes?\r\n\r\nThe Duke de Noailles advised that it would be necessary to proceed\r\nwith some caution in the matter. \"If his Majesty,\" he wrote to\r\nBaville, \"thinks there is no other remedy than changing the whole\r\npeople of the Cevennes, it would be better to begin by expelling those\r\nwho are not engaged in commerce, who inhabit inaccessible mountain\r\ndistricts, where the severity of the climate and the poverty of the\r\nsoil render them rude and barbarous, as in the case of those people\r\nwho recently met at the foot of the Lozère. Should the King consent to\r\nthis course, it will be necessary to send here at least four\r\nadditional battalions of foot to execute his orders.\"[34]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 34: Noailles to Baville, 29th October, 1686.]\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made to carry out this measure of deportation of the\r\npeople, but totally failed. With the aid of spies, stimulated by high\r\nrewards, numerous meetings in the Desert were fallen upon by the\r\ntroops, and those who were not hanged were transported--some to Italy,\r\nsome to Switzerland, and some to America. But transportation had no\r\nterrors for the people, and the meetings continued to be held as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nBaville then determined to occupy the entire province with troops, and\r\nto carry out a general disarmament of the population. Eight\r\nregiments of regular infantry were sent into the Cevennes, and fifty\r\nregiments of militia were raised throughout the province, forming\r\ntogether an army of some forty thousand men. Strong military posts\r\nwere established in the mountains, and new forts and barracks were\r\nerected at Alais, Anduze, St. Hyppolyte, and Nismes. The\r\nmountain-roads being almost impassable, many of them mere mule paths,\r\nBaville had more than a hundred new high-roads and branch-roads\r\nconstructed and made practicable for the passage of troops and\r\ntransport of cannon.\r\n\r\nBy these means the whole country became strongly occupied, but still\r\nthe meetings in the Desert went on. The peasantry continued to brave\r\nall risks--of exile, the galleys, the rack, and the gibbet--and\r\npersevered in their assemblies, until the very ferocity of their\r\npersecutors became wearied. The people would not be converted either\r\nby the dragoons or the priests who were stationed amongst them. In the\r\ndead of the night they would sally forth to their meetings in the\r\nhills; though their mountains were not too steep, their valleys not\r\ntoo secluded, their denies not too impenetrable to protect them from\r\npursuit and attack, for they were liable at any moment to be fallen\r\nupon and put to the sword.\r\n\r\nThe darkness, the dangers, the awe and mystery attending these\r\nmidnight meetings invested them with an extraordinary degree of\r\ninterest and even fascination. It is not surprising that under such\r\ncircumstances the devotion of these poor people should have run into\r\nfanaticism and superstition. Singing the psalms of Marot by night,\r\nunder the shadow of echoing rocks, they fancied they heard the sounds\r\nof heavenly voices filling the air. At other times they would meet\r\namidst the ruins of their fallen sanctuaries, and mysterious sounds of\r\nsobbing and wailing and groaning would seem as if to rise from the\r\ntombs of their fathers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnder these distressing circumstances--in the midst of poverty,\r\nsuffering, and terror--a sort of religious hysteria suddenly developed\r\nitself amongst the people, breaking out and spreading like many other\r\nforms of disease, and displaying itself chiefly in the most persecuted\r\nquarters of Dauphiny, Viverais, and the Cevennes. The people had lost\r\ntheir pastors; they had not the guidance of sober and intelligent\r\npersons; and they were left merely to pray and to suffer. The terrible\r\nraid of the priests against the Protestant books had even deprived\r\nmost of the Huguenots of their Bibles and psalm-books, so that they\r\nwere in a great measure left to profit by their own light, such as it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nThe disease to which we refer, had often before been experienced,\r\nunder different forms, amongst uneducated people when afflicted by\r\nterror and excitement; such, for instance, as the Brotherhood of the\r\nFlagellants, which followed the attack of the plague in the Middle\r\nAges; the Dancing Mania, which followed upon the Black Death; the\r\nChild's Pilgrimages, the Convulsionaires, the Revival epilepsies and\r\nswoons, which have so often accompanied fits of religious devotion\r\nworked up into frenzy; these diseases being merely the result of\r\nexcitement of the senses, which convulse the mind and powerfully\r\naffect the whole nervous system.\r\n\r\nThe \"prophetic malady,\" as we may call it, which suddenly broke out\r\namongst the poor Huguenots, began with epileptic convulsions. They\r\nfell to the ground senseless, foamed at the mouth, sobbed, and\r\neventually revived so far as to be able to speak and \"prophesy,\" like\r\na mesmerised person in a state of _clairvoyance_. The disease spread\r\nrapidly by the influence of morbid sympathy, which, under the peculiar\r\ncircumstances we have described, exercises an amazing power over human\r\nminds. Those who spoke with power were considered \"inspired.\" They\r\nprayed and preached ecstatically, the most inspired of the whole being\r\nwomen, boys, and even children.\r\n\r\nOne of the first \"prophets\" who appeared was Isabel Vincent, a young\r\nshepherdess of Crest, in Dauphiny, who could neither read nor write.\r\nHer usual speech was the patois of her country, but when she became\r\ninspired she spoke perfectly, and, according to Michelet, with great\r\neloquence. \"She chanted,\" he says, \"at first the Commandments, then a\r\npsalm, in a low and fascinating voice. She meditated a moment, then\r\nbegan the lamentation of the Church, tortured, exiled, at the galleys,\r\nin the dungeons: for all those evils she blamed our sins only, and\r\ncalled all to penitence. Then, starting anew, she spoke angelically of\r\nthe Divine goodness.\"\r\n\r\nBoucher, the intendant of the province, had her apprehended and\r\nexamined. She would not renounce. \"You may take my life,\" she said,\r\n\"but God will raise up others to speak better things than I have\r\ndone.\" She was at last imprisoned at Grenoble, and afterwards in the\r\nTower of Constance.\r\n\r\nAs Isabel Vincent had predicted, many prophets followed in her steps,\r\nbut they did not prophesy as divinely as she. They denounced \"Woe,\r\nwoe\" upon their persecutors. They reviled Babylon as the oppressor of\r\nthe House of Israel. They preached the most violent declamations\r\nagainst Rome, drawn from the most lugubrious of the prophets, and\r\nstirred the minds of their hearers into the most furious indignation.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which the contagion of convulsive prophesying spread\r\nwas extraordinary. The adherents were all of the poorer classes, who\r\nread nothing but the Bible, and had it nearly by heart. It spread from\r\nDauphiny to Viverais, and from thence into the Cevennes. \"I have\r\nseen,\" said Marshal Villars, \"things that I could never have believed\r\nif they had not passed under my own eyes--an entire city, in which all\r\nthe women and girls, without exception, appeared possessed by the\r\ndevil; they quaked and prophesied publicly in the streets.\"[35]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 35: \"Vie du Maréchal de Villars,\" i. 125.]\r\n\r\nFlottard says there were eight thousand persons in one province who\r\nhad inspiration. All were not, however, equally inspired. There were\r\nfour degrees of ecstasy: first, the being called; next, the\r\ninspiration; then, the prophesy; and, lastly, the gift, which was the\r\ninspiration in the highest degree.\r\n\r\nAll this may appear ludicrous to some. And yet the school of credulity\r\nis a very wide one. Even in these enlightened times in which we live,\r\nwe hear of tables turning, spelling out words, and \"prophesying\" in\r\ntheir own way. There are even philosophers, men of science, and\r\nliterati who believe in spiritualists that rise on sofas and float\r\nabout in the air, who project themselves suddenly out of one window\r\nand enter by another, and do many other remarkable things. And though\r\nour spiritual table-rapping and floating about may seem to be of no\r\npossible use, the \"prophesying\" of the Camisards was all but essential\r\nto the existence of the movement in which they were engaged.\r\n\r\nThe population became intensely excited by the prevalence of this\r\nenthusiasm or fanaticism. \"When a Huguenot assembly,\" says Brueys,\r\n\"was appointed, even before daybreak, from all the hamlets round, the\r\nmen, women, boys, girls, and even infants, came in crowds, hurrying\r\nfrom their huts, pierced through the woods, leapt over the rocks, and\r\nflew to the place of appointment.\"[36]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 36: Brueys, \"Histoire du Fanaticisme de Notre\r\n         Temps.\"]\r\n\r\nMere force was of no avail against people who supposed themselves to\r\nbe under supernatural influences. The meetings in the Desert,\r\naccordingly, were attended with increased and increasing fascination,\r\nand Baville, who had reported to the King the entire pacification and\r\nconversion of Languedoc, to his dismay found the whole province\r\nbursting with excitement, which a spark at any moment might fire into\r\nfrenzy. And that spark was shortly afterwards supplied by the\r\narchpriest Chayla, director of missions at Pont-de-Montvert.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was known that many of the peasantry attended the meetings\r\narmed, there had as yet been no open outbreak against the royal\r\nauthority in the Cevennes. At Cheilaret, in the Vivarais, there had\r\nbeen an encounter between the troops and the peasantry; but the people\r\nwere speedily dispersed, leaving three hundred dead and fifty wounded\r\non the field.\r\n\r\nThe Intendant Baville, after thus pacifying the Vivarais, was\r\nproceeding on his way back to Montpellier, escorted by some companies\r\nof dragoons and militia, passing through the Cevennes by one of the\r\nnew roads he had caused to be constructed along the valley of the\r\nTarn, by Pont-de-Montvert to Florac. What was his surprise, on passing\r\nthrough the village of Pont-de-Montvert, to hear the roll of a drum,\r\nand shortly after to perceive a column of rustics, some three or four\r\nhundred in number, advancing as if to give him battle. Baville at once\r\ndrew up his troops and charged the column, which broke and fled into\r\nan adjoining wood. Some were killed and others taken prisoners, who\r\nwere hanged next day at St. Jean-du-Gard. A reward of five hundred\r\nlouis d'or was advertised for the leader, who was shortly after\r\ntracked to his hiding-place in a cavern situated between Anduze and\r\nAlais, and was there shot, but not until after he had killed three\r\nsoldiers with his fusil.\r\n\r\nAfter this event persecution was redoubled throughout the Cevennes.\r\nThe militia ran night and day after the meetings in the Desert. All\r\npersons found attending them, who could be captured, were either\r\nkilled on the spot or hanged. Two companies of militia were quartered\r\nin Pont-de-Montvert at the expense of the inhabitants; and they acted\r\nunder the direction of the archpriest Du Chayla. This priest, who was\r\na native of the district, had been for some time settled as a\r\nmissionary in Siam engaged in the conversion of Buddhists, and on his\r\nreturn to France he was appointed to undertake the conversion of the\r\npeople of the Cevennes to the faith of Rome.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe village of Pont-de-Montvert is situated in the hollow of a deep\r\nvalley formed by the mountain of Lozère on the north, and of Bougès on\r\nthe south, at the point at which two streams, descending from their\r\nrespective summits, flow into the Tarn. The village is separated by\r\nthese streams into three little hamlets, which are joined together by\r\nthe bridge which gives its name to the place. The addition of \"Mont\r\nVert,\" however, is a misnomer; for though seated at the foot of a\r\nsteep mountain, it is not green, but sterile, rocky, and verdureless.\r\nThe village is best reached from Florac, from which it is about twenty\r\nmiles distant. The valley runs east and west, and is traversed by a\r\ntolerably good road, which at the lower part follows the windings of\r\nthe Tarn, and higher up runs in and out along the mountain ledges, at\r\nevery turn presenting new views of the bold, grand, and picturesque\r\nscenery which characterizes the wilder parts of the Cevennes. Along\r\nthis route the old mule-road is still discernible in some places--a\r\ndifficult, rugged, mountain path, which must have kept the district\r\nsealed up during the greater part of the year, until Baville\r\nconstructed the new road for the purpose of opening up the country for\r\nthe easier passage of troops and munitions of war.\r\n\r\nA few poor hamlets occur at intervals along the road, sometimes\r\nperched on apparently inaccessible rocks, and at the lower part of the\r\nvalley an occasional château is to be seen, as at Miral, picturesquely\r\nsituated on a height. But the country is too poor by nature--the\r\nbreadth of land in the bottom of the ravine being too narrow and that\r\non the mountain ledges too stony and sterile--ever to have enabled it\r\nto maintain a considerable population. On all sides little is to be\r\nseen but rocky mountain sides, stony and precipitous, with bold\r\nmountain peaks extending beyond them far away in the distance.\r\n\r\nPont-de-Montvert is the centre of a series of hamlets, the inhabitants\r\nof which were in former times almost exclusively Protestant, as they\r\nare now; and where meetings in the Desert were of the most frequent\r\noccurrence. Strong detachments of troops were accordingly stationed\r\nthere and at Florac for the purpose of preventing the meetings and\r\noverawing the population. Besides soldiers, the authorities also\r\nestablished missions throughout the Cevennes, and the principal\r\ninspector of these missions was the archpriest Chayla. The house in\r\nwhich he resided at Pont-de-Montvert is still pointed out. It is\r\nsituated near the north end of the bridge over the Tarn; but though\r\nthe lower part of the building remains as it was in his time, the\r\nupper portion has been for the most part rebuilt.\r\n\r\nChayla was a man of great force of character--zealous, laborious, and\r\nindefatigable--but pitiless, relentless, and cruel. He had no bowels\r\nof compassion. He was deaf to all appeals for mercy. With him the\r\npenalty of non-belief in the faith of Rome was imprisonment, torture,\r\ndeath. Eight young priests lived with him, whose labours he directed;\r\nand great was his annoyance to find that the people would not attend\r\nhis ministrations, but continued to flock after their own\r\nprophet-preachers in the Desert.\r\n\r\nMoral means having failed, he next tried physical. He converted the\r\narched cellars of his dwelling into dungeons, where he shut up those\r\nguilty of contumacy; and day by day he put them to torture. It seems\r\nlike a satire on religion to say that, in his attempt to convert\r\nsouls, this vehement missionary made it one of his principal studies\r\nto find out what amount of agony the bodies of those who differed from\r\nhim would bear short of actual death. He put hot coals into their\r\nhands, which they were then made to clench; wrapped round their\r\nfingers cotton steeped in oil, which was then set on fire; besides\r\npractising upon them the more ordinary and commonplace tortures. No\r\nwonder that the archpriest came to be detested by the inhabitants of\r\nPont-de-Montvert.\r\n\r\nAt length, a number of people in the district, in order to get beyond\r\nreach of Chayla's cruelty, determined to emigrate from France and take\r\nrefuge in Geneva. They assembled one morning secretly, a cavalcade of\r\nmen and women, and set out under the direction of a guide who knew the\r\nmountain paths towards the east. When they had travelled a few hours,\r\nthey fell into an ambuscade of militia, and were marched back to the\r\narchpriest's quarters at Pont-de-Montvert. The women were sent to\r\nMende to be immured in convents, and the men were imprisoned in the\r\narchpriest's dungeons. The parents of some of the captives ran to\r\nthrow themselves at his feet, and implored mercy for their sons; but\r\nChayla was inexorable. He declared harshly that the prisoners must\r\nsuffer according to the law--that the fugitives must go the galleys,\r\nand their guide to the gibbet.\r\n\r\nOn the following Sunday, the 23rd of July, 1702, one of the preaching\r\nprophets, Pierre Seguier of Magistavols, a hamlet lying to the south\r\nof Pont-de-Montvert, preached to an assembly on the neighbouring\r\nmountain of Bougès; and there he declared that the Lord had ordered\r\nhim to take up arms to deliver the captives and exterminate the\r\narchpriest of Moloch. Another and another preacher followed in the\r\nsame strain, the excited assembly encouraging them by their cries, and\r\ncalling upon them to execute God's vengeance on the persecutors of\r\nGod's people.\r\n\r\nThat same night Seguier and his companions went round amongst the\r\nneighbouring hamlets to summon an assemblage of their sworn followers\r\nfor the evening of the following day. They met punctually in the\r\nAltefage Wood, and under the shadow of three gigantic beech trees, the\r\ntrunks of which were standing but a few years ago, they solemnly swore\r\nto deliver their companions and destroy the archpriest.\r\n\r\nWhen night fell, a band of fifty determined men marched down the\r\nmountain towards the bridge, led by Seguier. Twenty of them were armed\r\nwith guns and pistols. The rest carried scythes and hatchets. As they\r\napproached the village, they sang Marot's version of the\r\nseventy-fourth Psalm. The archpriest heard the unwonted sound as they\r\ncame marching along. Thinking it was a nocturnal assembly, he cried to\r\nhis soldiers, \"Run and see what this means.\" But the doors of the\r\nhouse were already invested by the mountaineers, who shouted out for\r\n\"The prisoners! the prisoners!\" \"Back, Huguenot canaille!\" cried\r\nChayla from the window. But they only shouted the louder for \"The\r\nprisoners!\"\r\n\r\nThe archpriest then directed the militia to fire, and one of the\r\npeasants fell dead. Infuriated, they seized the trunk of a tree, and\r\nusing it as a battering-ram, at once broke in the door. They next\r\nproceeded to force the entrance to the dungeon, in which they\r\nsucceeded, and called upon the prisoners to come forth. But some of\r\nthem were so crippled by the tortures to which they had been\r\nsubjected, that they could not stand. At sight of their sufferings the\r\nfury of the assailants increased, and, running up the staircase, they\r\ncalled out for the archpriest. \"Burn the priest and the satellites of\r\nBaal!\" cried their leader; and heaping together the soldiers' straw\r\nbeds, the chairs, and other combustibles, they set the whole on fire.\r\n\r\nChayla, in the hope of escaping, jumped from a window into the garden,\r\nand in the fall broke his leg. The peasants discovered him by the\r\nlight of the blazing dwelling. He called for mercy. \"No,\" said\r\nSeguier, \"only such mercy as you have shown to others;\" and he struck\r\nhim the first blow.\r\n\r\nThe others followed. \"This for my father,\" said the next, \"whom you\r\nracked to death!\"\r\n\r\n\"This for my brother,\" said another, \"whom you sent to the galleys!\"\r\n\r\n\"This for my mother, who died of grief!\"\r\n\r\nThis for my sister, my relatives, my friends, in exile, in prison, in\r\nmisery!\r\n\r\nAnd thus blow followed blow, fifty-two in all, half of which would\r\nprobably have been mortal, and the detested Chayla lay a bleeding mass\r\nat their feet!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of the Country of the Cevennes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nINSURRECTION OF THE CAMISARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poor peasants, wool-carders, and neatherds of the Cevennes, formed\r\nonly a small and insignificant section of the great body of men who\r\nwere about the same time engaged in different countries of Europe in\r\nvindicating the cause of civil and religious liberty. For this cause,\r\na comparative handful of people in the Low Countries, occupying the\r\nDutch United Provinces, had banded themselves together to resist the\r\narmies of Spain, then the most powerful monarchy in the world. The\r\nstruggle had also for some time been in progress in England and\r\nScotland, where it culminated in the Revolution of 1688; and it was\r\nstill raging in the Vaudois valleys of Piedmont.\r\n\r\nThe object contended for in all these cases was the same. It was the\r\nvindication of human freedom against royal and sacerdotal despotism.\r\nIt could only have been the direst necessity that drove a poor,\r\nscattered, unarmed peasantry, such as the people of the Cevennes, to\r\ntake up arms against so powerful a sovereign as Louis XIV. Their\r\npassive resistance had lasted for fifteen long years, during which\r\nmany of them had seen their kindred racked, hanged, or sent to the\r\ngalleys; and at length their patience was exhausted, and the\r\ninevitable outburst took place. Yet they were at any moment ready to\r\nlay down their arms and return to their allegiance, provided only a\r\nreasonable degree of liberty of worship were assured to them. This,\r\nhowever, their misguided and bigoted monarch, would not tolerate; for\r\nhe had sworn that no persons were to be suffered in his dominions save\r\nthose who were of \"the King's religion.\"\r\n\r\nThe circumstances accompanying the outbreak of the Protestant\r\npeasantry in the Cevennes in many respects resembled those which\r\nattended the rising of the Scotch Covenanters in 1679. Both were\r\noccasioned by the persistent attempts of men in power to enforce a\r\nparticular form of religion at the point of the sword. The resisters\r\nof the policy were in both cases Calvinists;[37] and they were alike\r\nindomitable and obstinate in their assertion of the rights of\r\nconscience. They held that religion was a matter between man and his\r\nGod, and not between man and his sovereign or the Pope. The peasantry\r\nin both cases persevered in their own form of worship. In Languedoc,\r\nthe mountaineers of the Cevennes held their assemblies in \"The\r\nDesert;\" and in Scotland, the \"hill-folk\" of the West held their\r\nmeetings on the muirs. In the one country as in the other, the\r\nmonarchy sent out soldiers as their missionaries--Louis XIV. employing\r\nthe dragoons of Louvois and Baville, and Charles II. those of\r\nClaverhouse and Dalzell. These failing, new instruments of torture\r\nwere invented for their \"conversion.\" But the people, in both cases,\r\ncontinued alike stubborn in their adherence to their own simple and,\r\nas some thought, uncouth form of faith.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 37: Whether it be that Calvinism is eclectic as\r\n         regards races and individuals, or that it has (as is most\r\n         probably the case) a powerful formative influence upon\r\n         individual character, certain it is that the Calvinists of\r\n         all countries have presented the strongest possible\r\n         resemblance to each other--the Calvinists of Geneva and\r\n         Holland, the Huguenots of France, the Covenanters of\r\n         Scotland, and the Puritans of Old and New England, seeming,\r\n         as it were, to be but members of the same family. It is\r\n         curious to speculate on the influence which the religion of\r\n         Calvin--himself a Frenchman--might have exercised on the\r\n         history of France, as well as on the individual character of\r\n         Frenchmen, had the balance of forces carried the nation\r\n         bodily over to Protestantism (as was very nearly the case)\r\n         towards the end of the sixteenth century. Heinrich Heine has\r\n         expressed the opinion that the western races contain a large\r\n         proportion of men for whom the moral principle of Judaism has\r\n         a strong elective affinity; and in the sixteenth and\r\n         seventeenth centuries, the Old Testament certainly seems to\r\n         have exercised a much more powerful influence on the minds of\r\n         religious reformers than the New. \"The Jews,\" says Heine,\r\n         \"were the Germans of the East, and nowadays the Protestants\r\n         in German countries (England, Scotland, America, Germany,\r\n         Holland) are nothing more nor less than ancient Oriental\r\n         Jews.\"]\r\n\r\nThe French Calvinist peasantry, like the Scotch, were great in their\r\npreachers and their prophets. Both devoted themselves with enthusiasm\r\nto psalmody, insomuch that \"psalm-singers\" was their nickname in both\r\ncountries. The one had their Clement Marot by heart, the other their\r\nSternhold and Hopkins. Huguenot prisoners in chains sang psalms in\r\ntheir dungeons, galley slaves sang them as they plied at the oar,\r\nfugitives in the halting-places of their flight, the condemned as they\r\nmarched to the gallows, and the Camisards as they rushed into battle.\r\nIt was said of the Covenanters that \"they lived praying and preaching,\r\nand they died praying and fighting;\" and the same might have been said\r\nof the Huguenot peasantry of the Cevennes.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of the outbreak of the insurrection in both\r\ncountries was also similar. In the one case, it was the cruelty of the\r\narchpriest Chayla, the inventor of a new machine of torture called\r\n\"the Squeezers,\"[38] and in the other the cruelty of Archbishop\r\nSharpe, the inventor of that horrible instrument called \"the Iron\r\nBoot,\" that excited the fury of the people; and the murder of the one\r\nby Seguier and his band at Pont-de-Montvert, as of the other by\r\nBalfour of Burley and his companions on Magus Muir, proved the signal\r\nfor a general insurrection of the peasantry in both countries. Both\r\nacts were of like atrocity; but they corresponded in character with\r\nthe cruelties which had provoked them. Insurrections, like\r\nrevolutions, are not made of rose-water. In such cases, action and\r\nreaction are equal; the violence of the oppressors usually finding its\r\ncounterpart in the violence of the oppressed.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 38: The instrument is thus described by Cavalier,\r\n         in his \"Memoirs of the Wars of the Cevennes,\" London, 1726:\r\n         \"This inhuman man had invented a rack (more cruel, if it be\r\n         possible, than that usually made use of) to torment these\r\n         poor unfortunate gentlemen and ladies; which was a beam he\r\n         caused to be split in two, with vices at each end. Every\r\n         morning he would send for these poor people, in order to\r\n         examine them, and if they refused to confess what he desired,\r\n         he caused their legs to be put in the slit of the beam, and\r\n         there squeezed them till the bones cracked,\" &c., &c. (p.\r\n         35).]\r\n\r\nThe insurrection of the French peasantry proved by far the most\r\ndetermined and protracted of the two; arising probably from the more\r\ndifficult character of the mountain districts which they occupied and\r\nthe quicker military instincts of the people, as well as because\r\nseveral of their early leaders and organizers were veteran soldiers\r\nwho had served in many campaigns. The Scotch insurgents were\r\nsuppressed by the English army under the Duke of Monmouth in less than\r\ntwo months after the original outbreak, though their cause eventually\r\ntriumphed in the Revolution of 1688; whereas the peasantry of the\r\nCevennes, though deprived of all extraneous help, continued to\r\nmaintain a heroic struggle for several years, but were under the\r\nnecessity of at last succumbing to the overpowering military force of\r\nLouis XIV., after which the Huguenots of France continued to be\r\nstamped out of sight, and apparently out of existence, for nearly a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter, we left the archpriest Chayla a corpse at\r\nthe feet of his murderers. Several of the soldiers found in the\r\nchâteau were also killed, as well as the cook and house-steward, who\r\nhad helped to torture the prisoners. But one of the domestics, and a\r\nsoldier, who had treated them with kindness, were, at their\r\nintercession, pardoned and set at liberty. The corpses were brought\r\ntogether in the garden, and Seguier and his companions, kneeling round\r\nthem--a grim and ghastly sight--sang psalms until daybreak, the\r\nuncouth harmony mingling with the crackling of the flames of the\r\ndwelling overhead, and the sullen roar of the river rushing under the\r\nneighbouring bridge.\r\n\r\nWhen the grey of morning appeared, the men rose from their knees,\r\nemerged from the garden, crossed the bridge, and marched up the main\r\nstreet of the village. The inhabitants had barricaded themselves in\r\ntheir houses, being in a state of great fear lest they should be\r\nimplicated in the murder of the archpriest. But Seguier and his\r\nfollowers made no further halt in Pont-de-Montvert, but passed along,\r\nstill singing psalms, towards the hamlet of Frugères, a little further\r\nup the valley of the Tarn.\r\n\r\nSeguier has been characterised as \"the Danton of the Cevennes.\" This\r\nfierce and iron-willed man was of great stature--bony and\r\ndark-visaged, without upper teeth, his hair hanging loose over his\r\nshoulders--and of a wild and mystic appearance, occasioned probably by\r\nthe fits of ecstasy to which he was subject, and the wandering life he\r\nhad for so many years led as a prophet-preacher in the Desert. This\r\nterrible man had resolved upon a general massacre of the priests, and\r\nhe now threw himself upon Frugères for the purpose of carrying out the\r\nenterprise begun by him at Pont-de-Montvert. The curé of the hamlet,\r\nwho had already heard of Chayla's murder, fled from his house at sound\r\nof the approaching psalm-singers, and took refuge in an adjoining\r\nrye-field. He was speedily tracked thither, and brought down by a\r\nmusket-ball; and a list of twenty of his parishioners, whom he had\r\ndenounced to the archpriest, was found under his cassock.\r\n\r\nFrom Frugères the prophet and his band marched on to St. Maurice de\r\nVentalong, so called because of the winds which at certain seasons\r\nblow so furiously along the narrow valley in which it is situated; but\r\nthe prior of the convent, having been warned of the outbreak, had\r\nalready mounted his horse and taken to flight. Here Seguier was\r\ninformed of the approach of a body of militia who were on his trail;\r\nbut he avoided them by taking refuge on a neighbouring mountain-side,\r\nwhere he spent the night with his companions in a thicket.\r\n\r\nNext morning, at daybreak, he descended the mountain, crossed the\r\ntrack of his pursuers, and directed himself upon St. André de Lancèze.\r\nThe whole country was by this time in a state of alarm; and the curé\r\nof the place, being on the outlook, mounted the clock-tower and rang\r\nthe tocsin. But his parishioners having joined the insurgents, the\r\ncuré was pursued, captured in the belfry, and thrown from its highest\r\nwindow. The insurgents then proceeded to gut the church, pull down the\r\ncrosses, and destroy all the emblems of Romanism on which they could\r\nlay their hands.\r\n\r\nSeguier and his band next hurried across the mountains towards the\r\nsouth, having learnt that the curés of the neighbourhood had assembled\r\nat St. Germain to assist at the obsequies of the archpriest Chayla,\r\nwhose body had been brought thither from Pont-de-Montvert on the\r\nmorning after his murder. When Seguier was informed that the town and\r\ncountry militia were in force in the place, he turned aside and went\r\nin another direction. The curés, however, having heard that Seguier\r\nwas in the neighbourhood, fled panic-stricken, some to the château of\r\nPortes, others to St. André, while a number of them did not halt until\r\nthey had found shelter within the walls of Alais, some twenty miles\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nThus four days passed. On the fifth night Seguier appeared before the\r\nchâteau of Ladevèze, and demanded the arms which had been deposited\r\nthere at the time of the disarmament of the peasantry. The owner\r\nreplied by a volley of musketry, which killed and wounded several of\r\nthe insurgents, at the same time ringing the alarm-bell. Seguier,\r\nfurious at this resistance, at once burst open the gates, and ordered\r\na general massacre of the household. This accomplished, he ransacked\r\nthe place of its arms and ammunition, and before leaving set the\r\ncastle on fire, the flames throwing a lurid glare over the surrounding\r\ncountry. Seguier's band then descended the mountain on which the\r\nchâteau is situated, and made for the north in the direction of\r\nCassagnas, arriving at the elevated plateau of Font-Morte a little\r\nbefore daybreak.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Baville, the intendant of the province, was hastening\r\nto Pont-de-Montvert to put down the insurrection and avenge the death\r\nof the archpriest. The whole country was roused. Troops were\r\ndispatched in hot haste from Alais; the militia were assembled from\r\nall quarters and marched upon the disturbed district. The force was\r\nplaced under the orders of Captain Poul, an old soldier of fortune,\r\nwho had distinguished himself in the German wars, and in the recent\r\ncrusade against the Italian Vaudois. It was because of the individual\r\nprowess which Captain Poul had displayed in his last campaign, that,\r\nat the peace of Ryswick, Baville requested that he should be attached\r\nto the army of Languedoc, and employed in putting down the insurgents\r\nof the Cevennes.\r\n\r\nCaptain Poul was hastening with his troops to Florac when, having been\r\ninformed of the direction in which Seguier and his band had gone, he\r\nturned aside at Barre, and after about an hour's march eastward, he\r\ncame up with them at Font-Morte. They suddenly started up from amongst\r\nthe broom where they had lain down to sleep, and, firing off their\r\nguns upon the advancing host, without offering any further resistance,\r\nfled in all directions. Poul and his men spurred after them, cutting\r\ndown the fugitives. Coming up with Seguier, who was vainly trying to\r\nrally his men, Poul took him prisoner with several others, and they\r\nwere forthwith chained and marched to Florac. As they proceeded along\r\nthe road, Poul said to Seguier, \"Well, wretch! now I have got you, how\r\ndo you expect to be treated after the crimes you have committed?\" \"As\r\nI would myself have treated you, had I taken you prisoner,\" was the\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nSeguier stood before his judges calm and fearless. \"What is your\r\nname?\" he was asked. \"Pierre Seguier.\" \"Why do they call you Esprit?\"\r\n\"Because the Spirit of God is in me.\" \"Your abode?\" \"In the Desert,\r\nand shortly in heaven.\" \"Ask pardon of the King!\" \"We have no other\r\nKing but the Eternal.\" \"Have you no feeling of remorse for your\r\ncrimes?\" \"My soul is as a garden full of shady groves and of peaceful\r\nfountains.\"\r\n\r\nSeguier was condemned to have his hands cut off at the wrist, and he\r\nburnt alive at Pont-de-Montvert. Nouvel, another of the prisoners, was\r\nbroken alive at Ladevèze, and Bonnet, a third, was hanged at St.\r\nAndré. They all suffered without flinching. Seguier's last words,\r\nspoken amidst the flames, were, \"Brethren, wait, and hope in the\r\nEternal. The desolate Carmel shall yet revive, and the solitary\r\nLebanon shall blossom as the rose!\" Thus perished the grim,\r\nunflinching prophet of Magistavols, the terrible avenger of the\r\ncruelties of Chayla, the earliest leader in the insurrection of the\r\nCamisards!\r\n\r\nIt is not exactly known how or when the insurgents were first called\r\nCamisards. They called themselves by no other name than \"The Children of\r\nGod\" (_Enfants de Dieu_); but their enemies variously nicknamed them\r\n\"The Barbets,\" \"The Vagabonds,\" \"The Assemblers,\" \"The Psalm-singers,\"\r\n\"The Fanatics,\" and lastly, \"The Camisards.\" This name is said to have\r\nbeen given them because of the common blouse or camisole which they\r\nwore--their only uniform. Others say that it arose from their wearing a\r\nwhite shirt, or camise, over their dress, to enable them to distinguish\r\neach other in their night attacks; and that this was not the case, is\r\npartly countenanced by the fact that in the course of the insurrection a\r\nbody of peasant royalists took the field, who designated themselves the\r\n\"_White_ Camisards,\" in contradistinction from the others. Others say\r\nthe word is derived from _camis_, signifying a roadrunner. But whatever\r\nthe origin of the word may be, the Camisards was the name most commonly\r\napplied to the insurgents, and by which they continue to be known in\r\nlocal history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Poul vigorously followed up the blow delivered at Font-Morte.\r\nHe apprehended all suspected persons in the Upper Cevennes, and sent\r\nthem before the judges at Florac. Unable to capture the insurgents who\r\nhad escaped, he seized their parents, their relations, and families,\r\nand these were condemned to various punishments. But what had become\r\nof the insurgents themselves? Knowing that they had nothing but death\r\nto expect, if taken, they hid themselves in caves known only to the\r\ninhabitants of the district, and so secretly that Poul thought they\r\nhad succeeded in making their escape from France. The Intendant\r\nBaville arrived at the same conclusion, and he congratulated himself\r\naccordingly on the final suppression of the outbreak. Leaving sundry\r\ndetachments of troops posted in the principal villages, he returned to\r\nAlais, and invited the fugitive priests at once to return to their\r\nrespective parishes.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining in concealment for several days, the surviving\r\ninsurgents met one night to consult as to the steps they were to take,\r\nwith a view to their personal safety. They had by this time been\r\njoined by several sympathizers, amongst others by three veteran\r\nsoldiers--Laporte, Espérandieu, and Rastelet--and by young Cavalier,\r\nwho had just returned from Geneva, where he had been in exile, and was\r\nnow ready to share in the dangers of his compatriots. The greater\r\nnumber of those present were in favour of bidding a final adieu to\r\nFrance, and escaping across the frontier into Switzerland, considering\r\nthat the chances of their offering any successful resistance to their\r\noppressors, were altogether hopeless. But against this craven course\r\nLaporte raised his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Brethren,\" said he, \"why depart into the land of the stranger? Have\r\nwe not a country of our own, the country of our fathers? It is, you\r\nsay, a country of slavery and death! Well! Free it! and deliver your\r\noppressed brethren. Never say, 'What can we do? we are few in number,\r\nand without arms!' The God of armies shall be our strength. Let us\r\nsing aloud the psalm of battles, and from the Lozère even to the sea\r\nIsrael will arise! As for arms, have we not our hatchets? These will\r\nbring us muskets! Brethren, there is only one course worthy to be\r\npursued. It is to live for our country; and, if need be, to die for\r\nit. Better die by the sword than by the rack or the gallows!\"\r\n\r\nFrom this moment, not another word was said of flight. With one voice,\r\nthe assembly cried to the speaker, \"Be our chief! It is the will of\r\nthe Eternal!\" \"The Eternal be the witness of your promises,\" replied\r\nLaporte; \"I consent to be your chief!\" He assumed forthwith the title\r\nof \"Colonel of the Children of God,\" and named his camp \"The camp of\r\nthe Eternal!\"\r\n\r\nLaporte belonged to an old Huguenot family of the village of\r\nMassoubeyran, near Anduze. They were respectable peasants, some of\r\nwhom lived by farming and others by trade. Old John Laporte had four\r\nsons, of whom the eldest succeeded his father as a small farmer and\r\ncattle-breeder, occupying the family dwelling at Massoubeyran, still\r\nknown there as the house of \"Laporte-Roland.\" It contains a secret\r\nretreat, opening from a corner of the floor, called the \"Cachette de\r\nRoland,\" in which the celebrated chief of this name, son of the\r\nowner, was accustomed to take refuge; and in this cottage, the old\r\nBible of Roland's father, as well as the halbert of Roland himself,\r\ncontinue to be religiously preserved.\r\n\r\nTwo of Laporte's brothers were Protestant ministers. One of them was\r\nthe last pastor of Collet-de-Deze in the Cevennes. Banished because of\r\nhis faith, he fled from France at the Revocation, joined the army of\r\nthe Prince of Orange in Holland, and came over with him to England as\r\nchaplain of one of the French regiments which landed at Torbay in\r\n1688. Another brother, also a pastor, remained in the Cevennes,\r\npreaching to the people in the Desert, though at the daily risk of his\r\nlife, and after about ten years' labour in this vocation, he was\r\napprehended, taken prisoner to Montpellier, and strangled on the\r\nPeyrou in the year 1696.\r\n\r\nThe fourth brother was the Laporte whom we have just described in\r\nundertaking the leadership of the hunted insurgents remaining in the\r\nUpper Cevennes. He had served as a soldier in the King's armies, and\r\nat the peace of Ryswick returned to his native village, the year after\r\nhis elder brother had suffered martyrdom at Montpellier. He settled\r\nfor a time at Collet-de-Deze, from which his other brother had been\r\nexpelled, and there he carried on the trade of an ironworker and\r\nblacksmith. He was a great, brown, brawny man, of vehement piety, a\r\nconstant frequenter of the meetings in the Desert, and a mighty\r\npsalm-singer--one of those strong, massive, ardent-natured men who so\r\npowerfully draw others after them, and in times of revolution exercise\r\na sort of popular royalty amongst the masses. The oppression which had\r\nraged so furiously in the district excited his utmost indignation,\r\nand when he sought out the despairing insurgents in the mountains,\r\nand found that they were contemplating flight, he at once gave\r\nutterance to the few burning words we have cited, and fixed their\r\ndetermination to strike at least another blow for the liberty of their\r\ncountry and their religion.\r\n\r\nThe same evening on which Laporte assumed the leadership (about the\r\nbeginning of August, 1702) he made a descent on three Roman Catholic\r\nvillages in the neighbourhood of the meeting-place, and obtained\r\npossession of a small stock of powder and balls. When it became known\r\nthat the insurgents were again drawing together, others joined them.\r\nAmongst these were Castonet, a forest-ranger of the Aigoal mountain\r\ndistrict in the west, who brought with him some twelve recruits from\r\nthe country near Vebron. Shortly after, there arrived from Vauvert the\r\nsoldier Catinet, bringing with him twenty more. Next came young\r\nCavalier, from Ribaute, with another band, armed with muskets which\r\nthey had seized from the prior of St. Martin, with whom they had been\r\ndeposited.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Laporte's nephew, young Roland, was running from village to\r\nvillage in the Vaunage, holding assemblies and rousing the people to\r\ncome to the help of their distressed brethren in the mountains. Roland\r\nwas a young man of bright intelligence, gifted with much of the\r\npreaching power of his family. His eloquence was of a martial sort,\r\nfor he had been bred a soldier, and though young, had already fought\r\nin many battles. He was everywhere received with open arms in the\r\nVaunage.\r\n\r\n\"My brethren,\" said he, \"the cause of God and the deliverance of\r\nIsrael is at stake. Follow us to the mountains. No country is better\r\nsuited for war--we have the hill-tops for camps, gorges for\r\nambuscades, woods to rally in, caves to hide in, and, in case of\r\nflight, secret tracts trodden only by the mountain goat. All the\r\npeople there are your brethren, who will throw open their cabins to\r\nyou, and share their bread and milk and the flesh of their sheep with\r\nyou, while the forests will supply you with chestnuts. And then, what\r\nis there to fear? Did not God nourish his chosen people with manna in\r\nthe desert? And does He not renew his miracles day by day? Will not\r\nhis Spirit descend upon his afflicted children? He consoles us, He\r\nstrengthens us, He calls us to arms, He will cause his angels to march\r\nbefore us! As for me, I am an old soldier, and will do my duty!\"[39]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 39: Brueys, \"Histoire de Fanatisme;\" Peyrat,\r\n         \"Histoire des Pasteurs du Désert.\"]\r\n\r\nThese stirring words evoked an enthusiastic response. Numbers of the\r\npeople thus addressed by Roland declared themselves ready to follow\r\nhim at once. But instead of taking with him all who were willing to\r\njoin the standard of the insurgents, he directed them to enrol and\r\norganize themselves, and await his speedy return; selecting for the\r\npresent only such as were in his opinion likely to make efficient\r\nsoldiers, and with these he rejoined his uncle in the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe number of the insurgents was thus raised to about a hundred and\r\nfifty--a very small body of men, contemptible in point of numbers\r\ncompared with the overwhelming forces by which they were opposed, but\r\nall animated by a determined spirit, and commanded by fearless and\r\nindomitable leaders. The band was divided into three brigades of fifty\r\neach; Laporte taking the command of the companions of Seguier; the\r\nnew-comers being divided into two bodies of like number, who elected\r\nRoland and Castanet as their respective chiefs.\r\n\r\nLaporte occupied the last days of August in drilling his troops, and\r\nfamiliarising them with the mountain district which was to be the\r\nscene of their operations. While thus engaged, he received an urgent\r\nmessage from the Protestant herdsmen of the hill-country of Vebron,\r\nwhose cattle, sheep, and goats a band of royalist militia, under\r\nColonel Miral, had captured, and were driving northward towards\r\nFlorac. Laporte immediately ran to their help, and posted himself to\r\nintercept them at the bridge of Tarnon, which they must cross. On the\r\nmilitia coming up, the Camisards fell upon them furiously, on which\r\nthey took to flight, and the cattle were driven back in triumph to the\r\nvillages.\r\n\r\nLaporte then led his victorious troops towards Collet, the village in\r\nwhich his brother had been pastor. The temple in which he ministered\r\nwas still standing--the only one in the Cevennes that had not been\r\ndemolished, the Seigneur of the place intending to convert it into a\r\nhospital. Collet was at present occupied by a company of fusiliers,\r\ncommanded by Captain Cabrières. On nearing the place, Laporte wrote to\r\nthis officer, under an assumed name, intimating that a religious\r\nassembly was to be held that night in a certain wood in the\r\nneighbourhood. The captain at once marched thither with his men, on\r\nwhich Laporte entered the village, and reopened the temple, which had\r\ncontinued unoccupied since the day on which his brother had gone into\r\nexile. All that night Laporte sang psalms, preached, and prayed by\r\nturns, solemnly invoking the help of the God of battles in this holy\r\nwar in which he was engaged for the liberation of his country. Shortly\r\nbefore daybreak, Laporte and his companions retired from the temple,\r\nand after setting fire to the Roman Catholic church, and the houses of\r\nthe consul, the captain, and the curé, he left the village, and\r\nproceeded in a northerly direction.\r\n\r\nThat same morning, Captain Poul arrived at the neighbouring valley of\r\nSt. Germain, for the purpose of superintending the demolition of\r\ncertain Protestant dwellings, and then he heard of Laporte's midnight\r\nexpedition. He immediately hastened to Collet, assembled all the\r\ntroops he could muster, and put himself on the track of the Camisards.\r\nAfter a hot march of about two hours in the direction of Coudouloux,\r\nPoul discerned Laporte and his band encamped on a lofty height, from\r\nthe scarped foot of which a sloping grove of chestnuts descended into\r\nthe wide grassy plain, known as the \"Champ Domergue.\"\r\n\r\nThe chestnut grove had in ancient times been one of the sacred places\r\nof the Druids, who celebrated their mysterious rites in its recesses,\r\nwhile the adjoining mountains were said to have been the honoured\r\nhaunts of certain of the divinities of ancient Gaul. It was therefore\r\nregarded as a sort of sacred place, and this circumstance was probably\r\nnot without its influence in rendering it one of the most frequent\r\nresorts of the hunted Protestants in their midnight assemblies, as\r\nwell as because it occupied a central position between the villages of\r\nSt. Frézal, St. Andéol, Dèze, and Violas. Laporte had now come hither\r\nwith his companions to pray, and they were so engaged when the scouts\r\non the look-out announced the approach of the enemy.\r\n\r\nPoul halted his men to take breath, while Laporte held a little\r\ncouncil of war. What was to be done? Laporte himself was in favour of\r\naccepting battle on the spot, while several of his lieutenants advised\r\nimmediate flight into the mountains. On the other hand, the young and\r\nimpetuous Cavalier, who was there, supported the opinion of his chief,\r\nand urged an immediate attack; and an attack was determined on\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nThe little band descended from their vantage-ground on the hill, and\r\ncame down into the chestnut wood, singing the sixty-eighth Psalm--\"Let\r\nGod arise, let his enemies be scattered.\" The following is the song\r\nitself, in the words of Marot. When the Huguenots sang it, each\r\nsoldier became a lion in courage.\r\n\r\n  \"Que Dieu se montre seulement\r\n   Et l'on verra dans un moment\r\n     Abandonner la place;\r\n   Le camp des ennemies épars,\r\n   Épouvanté de toutes parts,\r\n     Fuira devant sa face.\r\n\r\n   On verra tout ce camp s'enfuir,\r\n   Comme l'on voit s'évanouir;\r\n     Une épaisse fumée;\r\n   Comme la cire fond au feu,\r\n   Ainsi des méchants devant\r\n     Dieu, La force est consumée.\r\n\r\n   L'Éternel est notre recours;\r\n   Nous obtenons par son secours,\r\n     Plus d'une déliverance.\r\n   C'est Lui qui fut notre support,\r\n   Et qui tient les clefs de la mort,\r\n     Lui seul en sa puissance.\r\n\r\n   A nous défendre toujours prompt,\r\n   Il frappe le superbe front\r\n     De la troupe ennemie;\r\n   On verra tomber sous ses coups\r\n   Ceux qui provoquent son courroux\r\n     Par leur méchante vie.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the \"Marseillaise\" of the Camisards, their war-song in many\r\nbattles, sung by them as a _pas de charge_ to the music of Goudimal.\r\nPoul, seeing them approach from under cover of the wood, charged them\r\nat once, shouting to his men, \"Charge, kill, kill the Barbets!\"[40]\r\nBut \"the Barbets,\" though they were only as one to three of their\r\nassailants, bravely held their ground. Those who had muskets kept up a\r\nfusillade, whilst a body of scythemen in the centre repulsed Poul, who\r\nattacked them with the bayonet. Several of these terrible scythemen\r\nwere, however, slain, and three were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 40: The \"Barbets\" (or \"Water-dogs\") was the\r\n         nickname by which the Vaudois were called, against whom Poul\r\n         had formerly been employed in the Italian valleys.]\r\n\r\nLaporte, finding that he could not drive Poul back, retreated slowly\r\ninto the wood, keeping up a running fire, and reascended the hill,\r\nwhither Poul durst not follow him. The Royalist leader was satisfied\r\nwith remaining master of the hard-fought field, on which many of his\r\nsoldiers lay dead, together with a captain of militia.\r\n\r\nThe Camisard chiefs then separated, Laporte and his band taking a\r\nwesterly direction. The Royalists, having received considerable\r\nreinforcements, hastened from different directions to intercept him, but\r\nhe slipped through their fingers, and descended to Pont-de-Montvert,\r\nfrom whence he threw himself upon the villages situated near the sources\r\nof the western Gardon. At the same time, to distract the attention of\r\nthe Royalists, the other Camisard leaders descended, the one towards the\r\nsouth, and the other towards the east, disarming the Roman Catholics,\r\ncarrying off their arms, and spreading consternation wherever they went.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Count Broglie, Captain Poul, Colonel Miral, and the\r\ncommanders of the soldiers and militia all over the Cevennes, were\r\nhunting the Protestants and their families wherever found, pillaging\r\ntheir houses, driving away their cattle, and burning their huts; and\r\nit was evident that the war on both sides was fast drifting into one\r\nof reprisal and revenge. Brigands, belonging to neither side,\r\norganized themselves in bodies, and robbed Protestants and Catholics\r\nwith equal impartiality.\r\n\r\nOne effect of this state of things was rapidly to increase the numbers\r\nof the disaffected. The dwellings of many of the Protestants having\r\nbeen destroyed, such of the homeless fugitives as could bear arms fled\r\ninto the mountains to join the Camisards, whose numbers were thus\r\naugmented, notwithstanding the measures taken for their extermination.\r\n\r\nLaporte was at last tracked by his indefatigable enemy, Captain Poul,\r\nwho burned to wipe out the disgrace which he conceived himself to have\r\nsuffered at Champ-Domergue. Information was conveyed to him that\r\nLaporte and his band were in the neighbourhood of Molezon on the\r\nwestern Gardon, and that they intended to hold a field-meeting there\r\non Sunday, the 22nd of October.\r\n\r\nPoul made his dispositions accordingly. Dividing his force into two\r\nbodies, he fell upon the insurgents impetuously from two sides, taking\r\nthem completely by surprise. They hastily put themselves in order of\r\nbattle, but their muskets, wet with rain, would not fire, and Laporte\r\nhastened with his men to seek the shelter of a cliff near at hand.\r\nWhile in the act of springing from one rock to another, he was seen to\r\nstagger and fall. He had been shot dead by a musket bullet, and his\r\ncareer was thus brought to a sudden close. His followers at once fled\r\nin all directions.\r\n\r\nPoul cut off Laporte's head, as well as the heads of the other\r\nCamisards who had been killed, and sent them in two baskets to Count\r\nBroglie. Next day the heads were exposed on the bridge of Anduze; the\r\nday after on the castle wall of St. Hypolite; after which these\r\nghastly trophies of Poul's victory were sent to Montpellier to be\r\npermanently exposed on the Peyrou.\r\n\r\nSuch was the end of Laporte, the second leader of the Camisards.\r\nSeguier, the first, had been chief for only six days; Laporte, the\r\nsecond, for only about two months. Again Baville supposed the\r\npacification of the Cevennes to be complete. He imagined that Poul, in\r\ncutting off Laporte's head, had decapitated the insurrection. But the\r\nCamisard ranks had never been so full as now, swelled as they were by\r\nthe persecutions of the Royalists, who, by demolishing the homes of\r\nthe peasantry, had in a measure forced them into the arms of the\r\ninsurgents. Nor were they ever better supplied with leaders, even\r\nthough Laporte had fallen. No sooner did his death become known, than\r\nthe \"Children of God\" held a solemn assembly in the mountains, at\r\nwhich Roland, Castanet, Salomon, Abraham, and young Cavalier were\r\npresent; and after lamenting the death of their chief, they with one\r\naccord elected Laporte's nephew, Roland, as his successor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few words as to the associates of Roland, whose family and origin\r\nhave already been described. André Castanet of Massavaque, in the\r\nUpper Cevennes, had been a goatherd in his youth, after which he\r\nworked at his father's trade of a wool-carder. An avowed Huguenot, he\r\nwas, shortly after the peace of Ryswick, hunted out of the country\r\nbecause of his attending the meetings in the Desert; but in 1700 he\r\nreturned to preach and to prophesy, acting also as a forest-ranger in\r\nthe Aigoal Mountains. Of all the chiefs he was the greatest\r\ncontroversialist, and in his capacity of preacher he distinguished\r\nhimself from his companions by wearing a wig. There must have been\r\nsomething comical in his appearance, for Brueys describes him as a\r\nlittle, squat, bandy-legged man, presenting \"the figure of a little\r\nbear.\" But it was an enemy who drew the picture.\r\n\r\nNext there was Salomon Conderc, also a wool-carder, a native of the\r\nhamlet of Mazelrode, south of the mountain of Bougès. For twenty years\r\nthe Condercs, father and son, had been zealous worshippers in the\r\nDesert--Salomon having acted by turns as Bible-reader, precentor,\r\npreacher, and prophet. We have already referred to the gift of\r\nprophesying. All the leaders of the Camisards were prophets. Elie\r\nMarion, in his \"Théâtre Sacré de Cevennes,\" thus describes the\r\ninfluence of the prophets on the Camisard War:--\r\n\r\n\"We were without strength and without counsel,\" says he; \"but our\r\ninspirations were our succour and our support. They elected our\r\nleaders, and conducted them; they were our military discipline. It was\r\nthey who raised us, even weakness itself, to put a strong bridle upon\r\nan army of more than twenty thousand picked soldiers. It was they who\r\nbanished sorrow from our hearts in the midst of the greatest peril, as\r\nwell as in the deserts and the mountain fastnesses, when cold and\r\nfamine oppressed us. Our heaviest crosses were but lightsome burdens,\r\nfor this intimate communion that God allowed us to have with Him bore\r\nup and consoled us; it was our safety and our happiness.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the Condercs had suffered for their faith. The archpriest\r\nChayla had persecuted them grievously. One of their sisters was seized\r\nby the soldiery and carried off to be immured in a convent at Mende,\r\nbut was rescued on the way by Salomon and his brother Jacques. Of the\r\ntwo, Salomon, though deformed, had the greatest gift in prophesying,\r\nand hence the choice of him as a leader.\r\n\r\nAbraham Mazel belonged to the same hamlet as Conderc. They were both\r\nof the same age--about twenty-five--of the same trade, and they were\r\nas inseparable as brothers. They had both been engaged with Seguier's\r\nband in the midnight attack on Pont-de-Montvert, and were alike\r\ncommitted to the desperate enterprise they had taken in hand. The\r\ntribe of Mazel abounds in the Cevennes, and they had already given\r\nmany martyrs to the cause. Some emigrated to America, some were sent\r\nto the galleys; Oliver Mazel, the preacher, was hanged at Montpellier\r\nin 1690, Jacques Mazel was a refugee in London in 1701, and in all the\r\ncombats of the Cevennes there were Mazels leading as well as\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nNicholas Joany, of Genouillac, was an old soldier, who had seen much\r\nservice, having been for some time quartermaster of the regiment of\r\nOrleans. Among other veterans who served with the Camisards, were\r\nEspérandieu and Rastelet, two old sub-officers, and Catinat and\r\nRavenel, two thorough soldiers. Of these Catinat achieved the greatest\r\nnotoriety. His proper name was Mauriel--Abdias Mauriel; but having\r\nserved as a dragoon under Marshal Catinat in Italy, he conceived such\r\nan admiration for that general, and was so constantly eulogizing him,\r\nthat his comrades gave him the nickname of Catinat, which he continued\r\nto bear all through the Camisard war.\r\n\r\nBut the most distinguished of all the Camisard chiefs, next to Roland,\r\nwas the youthful John Cavalier, peasant boy, baker's apprentice, and\r\neventually insurgent leader, who, after baffling and repeatedly\r\ndefeating the armies of Louis XIV., ended his remarkable career as\r\ngovernor of Jersey and major-general in the British service.\r\n\r\nCavalier was a native of Ribaute, a village on the Gardon, a little\r\nbelow Anduze. His parents were persons in humble circumstances, as may\r\nbe inferred from the fact that when John was of sufficient age he was\r\nsent into the mountains to herd cattle, and when a little older he was\r\nplaced apprentice to a baker at Anduze.\r\n\r\nHis father, though a Protestant at heart, to avoid persecution,\r\npretended to be converted to Romanism, and attended Mass. But his\r\nmother, a fervent Calvinist, refused to conform, and diligently\r\ntrained her sons in her own views. She was a regular attender of\r\nmeetings in the Desert, to which she also took her children.\r\n\r\nCavalier relates that on one occasion, when a very little fellow, he\r\nwent with her to an assembly which was conducted by Claude Brousson;\r\nand when he afterwards heard that many of the people had been\r\napprehended for attending it, of whom some were hanged and others sent\r\nto the galleys, the account so shocked him that he felt he would then\r\nhave avenged them if he had possessed the power.\r\n\r\nAs the boy grew up, and witnessed the increasing cruelty with which\r\nconformity was enforced, he determined to quit the country; and,\r\naccompanied by twelve other young men, he succeeded in reaching Geneva\r\nafter a toilsome journey of eight days. He had not been at Geneva more\r\nthan two months, when--heart-sore, solitary, his eyes constantly\r\nturned towards his dear Cevennes--he accidentally heard that his\r\nfather and mother had been thrown into prison because of his\r\nflight--his father at Carcassone, and his mother in the dreadful tower\r\nof Constance, near Aiguesmortes, one of the most notorious prisons of\r\nthe Huguenots.\r\n\r\nHe at once determined to return, in the hope of being able to get them\r\nset at liberty. On his reaching Ribaute, to his surprise he found them\r\nalready released, on condition of attending Mass. As his presence in\r\nhis father's house might only serve to bring fresh trouble upon\r\nthem--he himself having no intention of conforming--he went up for\r\nrefuge into the mountains of the Cevennes.\r\n\r\nThe young Cavalier was present at the midnight meeting on the Bougès,\r\nat which it was determined to slay the archpriest Chayla. He implored\r\nleave to accompany the band; but he was declared to be too young for\r\nsuch an enterprise, being a boy of only sixteen, so he was left behind\r\nwith his friends.\r\n\r\nBeing virtually an outlaw, Cavalier afterwards joined the band of\r\nLaporte, under whom he served as lieutenant during his short career.\r\nAt his death the insurrection assumed larger proportions, and recruits\r\nflocked apace to the standard of Roland, Laporte's successor.\r\nHarvest-work over, the youths of the Lower Cevennes hastened to join\r\nhim, armed only with bills and hatchets. The people of the Vaunage\r\nmore than fulfilled their promise to Roland, and sent him five hundred\r\nmen. Cavalier also brought with him from Ribaute a further number of\r\nrecruits, and by the end of autumn the Camisards under arms, such as\r\nthey were, amounted to over a thousand men.\r\n\r\nRoland, unable to provide quarters or commissariat for so large a\r\nnumber, divided them into five bodies, and sent them into their\r\nrespective cantonments (so to speak) for the winter. Roland himself\r\noccupied the district known as the Lower Cevennes, comprising the\r\nGardonnenque and the mountain district situated between the rivers\r\nVidourle and the western Gardon. That part of the Upper Cevennes,\r\nwhich extends between the Anduze branch of the Gardon and the river\r\nTarn, was in like manner occupied by a force commanded by Abraham\r\nHazel and Solomon Conderc, while Andrew Castanet led the people of the\r\nwestern Cevennes, comprising the mountain region of the Aigoal and the\r\nEsperou, near the sources of the Gardon d'Anduze and the Tarnon. The\r\nrugged mountain district of the Lozère, in which the Tarn, the Ceze,\r\nand the Alais branch of the Gardon have their origin, was placed under\r\nthe command of Joany. And, finally, the more open country towards the\r\nsouth, extending from Anduze to the sea-coast, including the districts\r\naround Alais, Uzes, Nismes, as well as the populous valley of the\r\nVaunage, was placed under the direction of young Cavalier, though he\r\nhad scarcely yet completed his seventeenth year.\r\n\r\nThese chiefs were all elected by their followers, who chose them, not\r\nbecause of any military ability they might possess, but entirely\r\nbecause of their \"gifts\" as preachers and \"prophets.\" Though Roland\r\nand Joany had been soldiers, they were also preachers, as were\r\nCastanet, Abraham, and Salomon; and young Cavalier had already given\r\nremarkable indications of the prophetic gift. Hence, when it became\r\nthe duty of the band to which he belonged to select a chief, they\r\npassed over the old soldiers, Espérandieu, Raslet, Catinat, and\r\nRavenel, and pitched upon the young baker lad of Ribaute, not because\r\nhe could fight, but because he could preach; and the old soldiers\r\ncheerfully submitted themselves to his leadership.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of this remarkable Camisard chief represents him as a\r\nlittle handsome youth, fair and ruddy complexioned, with lively and\r\nprominent blue eyes, and a large head, from whence his long fair hair\r\nhung floating over his shoulders. His companions recognised in him a\r\nsupposed striking resemblance to the scriptural portrait of David, the\r\nfamous shepherd of Israel.\r\n\r\nThe Camisard legions, spread as they now were over the entire Cevennes,\r\nand embracing Lower Languedoc as far as the sea, were for the most part\r\noccupied during the winter of 1702-3 in organizing themselves, obtaining\r\narms, and increasing their forces. The respective districts which they\r\noccupied were so many recruiting-grounds, and by the end of the season\r\nthey had enrolled nearly three thousand men. They were still, however,\r\nvery badly armed. Their weapons included fowling-pieces, old matchlocks,\r\nmuskets taken from the militia, pistols, sabres, scythes, hatchets,\r\nbillhooks, and even ploughshares. They were very short of powder, and\r\nwhat they had was mostly bought surreptitiously from the King's\r\nsoldiers, or by messengers sent for the purpose to Nismes and Avignon.\r\nBut Roland, finding that such sources of supply could not be depended\r\nupon, resolved to manufacture his own powder.\r\n\r\nA commissariat was also established, and the most spacious caves in\r\nthe most sequestered places were sought out and converted into\r\nmagazines, hospitals, granaries, cellars, arsenals, and powder\r\nfactories. Thus Mialet, with its extensive caves, was the\r\nhead-quarters of Roland; Bouquet and the caves at Euzet, of Cavalier;\r\nCassagnacs and the caves at Magistavols, of Salomon; and so on with\r\nthe others. Each chief had his respective canton, his granary, his\r\nmagazine, and his arsenal. To each retreat was attached a special body\r\nof tradesmen--millers, bakers, shoemakers, tailors, armourers, and\r\nother mechanics; and each had its special guards and sentinels.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the peculiar geological features of the\r\nCevennes, and to the limestone strata which embraces the whole\r\ngranitic platform of the southern border almost like a frame. As is\r\nalmost invariably the case in such formations, large caves, occasioned\r\nby the constant dripping of water, are of frequent occurrence; and\r\nthose of the Cevennes, which are in many places of great extent,\r\nconstituted a peculiar feature in the Camisard insurrection. There is\r\none of such caves in the neighbourhood of the Protestant town of\r\nGanges, on the river Herault, which often served as a refuge for the\r\nHuguenots, though it is now scarcely penetrable because of the heavy\r\nfalls of stone from the roof. This cavern has two entrances, one from\r\nthe river Herault, the other from the Mendesse, and it extends under\r\nthe entire mountain, which separates the two rivers. It is still known\r\nas the \"Camisards' Grotto.\" There are numerous others of a like\r\ncharacter all over the district; but as those of Mialet were of\r\nspecial importance--Mialet, \"the Metropolis of the Insurrection,\"\r\nbeing the head-quarters of Roland--it will be sufficient if we briefly\r\ndescribe a visit paid to them in the month of June, 1870.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe town of Anduze is the little capital of the Gardonnenque, a\r\ndistrict which has always been exclusively Protestant. Even at the\r\npresent day, of the 5,200 inhabitants of Anduze, 4,600 belong to that\r\nfaith; and these include the principal proprietors, cultivators, and\r\nmanufacturers of the town and neighbourhood. During the wars of\r\nreligion, Anduze was one of the Huguenot strongholds. After the death\r\nof Henry IV. the district continued to be held by the Duc de Rohan,\r\nthe ruins of whose castle are still to be seen on the summit of a\r\npyramidal hill on the north of the town. Anduze is jammed in between\r\nthe precipitous mountain of St. Julien, which rises behind it, and the\r\nriver Gardon, along which a modern quay-wall extends, forming a\r\npleasant promenade as well as a barrier against the furious torrents\r\nwhich rush down from the mountains in winter.\r\n\r\nA little above the town, the river passes through a rocky gorge formed\r\nby the rugged grey cliffs of Peyremale on the one bank and St. Julien\r\non the other. The bare precipitous rocks rise up on either side like\r\ntwo cyclopean towers, flanking the gateway of the Cevennes. The gorge\r\nis so narrow at bottom that there is room only for the river running\r\nin its rocky bed below, and a roadway along either bank--that on the\r\neastern side having been partly formed by blasting out the cliff which\r\noverhangs it.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the five-arched bridge which spans the Gardon, the road\r\nproceeds along the eastern bank, up the valley towards Mialet. It\r\nbeing market-day at Anduze, well-clad peasants were flocking into the\r\ntown, some in their little pony-carts, others with their baskets or\r\nbundles of produce, and each had his \"Bon jour, messieurs!\" for us as\r\nwe passed. So long as the road held along the bottom of the valley,\r\npassing through the scattered hamlets and villages north of the town,\r\nour little springless cart got along cleverly enough. But after we had\r\nentered the narrower valley higher up, and the cultivated ground\r\nbecame confined to a little strip along either bank, then the mountain\r\nbarriers seemed to rise in front of us and on all sides, and the road\r\nbecame winding, steep, and difficult.\r\n\r\nA few miles up the valley, the little hamlet of Massoubeyran,\r\nconsisting of a group of peasant cottages--one of which was the\r\nbirthplace of Roland, the Camisard chief--was seen on a hill-side to\r\nthe right; and about two miles further on, at a bend of the road, we\r\ncame in sight of the village of Mialet, with its whitewashed,\r\nflat-roofed cottages--forming a little group of peasants' houses lying\r\nin the hollow of the hills. The principal building in it is the\r\nProtestant temple, which continues to be frequented by the\r\ninhabitants; the _Annuaire Protestant_ for 1868-70, stating the\r\nProtestant population of the district to be 1,325. Strange to say, the\r\npresent pastor, M. Seguier, bears the name of the first leader of the\r\nCamisard insurrection; and one of the leading members of the\r\nconsistory, M. Laporte, is a lineal descendant of the second and third\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nFrom its secluded and secure position among the hills, as well as\r\nbecause of its proximity to the great Temelac road constructed by\r\nBaville, which passed from Anduze by St. Jean-de-Gard into the Upper\r\nCevennes, Mialet was well situated as the head-quarters of the\r\nCamisard chief. But it was principally because of the numerous\r\nlimestone caves abounding in the locality, which afforded a ready\r\nhiding-place for the inhabitants in the event of the enemies'\r\napproach, as well as because they were capable of being adapted for\r\nthe purpose of magazines, stores, and hospitals, that Mialet became of\r\nso much importance as the citadel of the insurgents. One of such\r\ncaverns or grottoes is still to be seen about a mile below Mialet, of\r\nextraordinary magnitude. It extends under the hill which rises up on\r\nthe right-hand side of the road, and is entered from behind, nearly\r\nat the summit. The entrance is narrow and difficult, but the interior\r\nis large and spacious, widening out in some places into dome-shaped\r\nchambers, with stalactites hanging from the roof. The whole extent of\r\nthis cavern cannot be much less than a quarter of a mile, judging from\r\nthe time it took to explore it and to return from the furthest point\r\nin the interior to the entrance. The existence of this place had been\r\nforgotten until a few years ago, when it was rediscovered by a man of\r\nAnduze, who succeeded in entering it, but, being unable to find his\r\nway out, he remained there for three days without food, until the\r\nalarm was given and his friends came to his rescue and delivered him.\r\n\r\nImmediately behind the village of Mialet, under the side of the hill,\r\nis another large cavern, with other grottoes branching out of it,\r\ncapable, on an emergency, of accommodating the whole population. This\r\nwas used by Roland as his principal magazine. But perhaps the most\r\ninteresting of these caves is the one used as a hospital for the sick\r\nand wounded. It is situated about a mile above Mialet, in a limestone\r\ncliff almost overhanging the river. The approach to it is steep and\r\ndifficult, up a footpath cut in the face of the rock. At length a\r\nlittle platform is reached, about a hundred feet above the level of\r\nthe river, behind which is a low wall extending across the entrance to\r\nthe cavern. This wall is pierced with two openings, intended for two\r\nculverins, one of which commanded the road leading down the pass, and\r\nthe other the road up the valley from the direction of the village.\r\nThe outer vault is large and roomy, and extends back into a lofty\r\ndome-shaped cavern about forty feet high, behind which a long tortuous\r\nvault extends for several hundred feet. The place is quite dry, and\r\nsufficiently spacious to accommodate a large number of persons; and\r\nthere can be no doubt as to the uses to which it was applied during\r\nthe wars of the Cevennes.\r\n\r\nThe person who guided us to the cave was an ordinary working man of\r\nthe village--apparently a blacksmith--a well-informed, intelligent\r\nperson--who left his smithy, opposite the Protestant temple at which\r\nour pony-cart drew up, to show us over the place; and he took pride in\r\nrelating the traditions which continue to be handed down from father\r\nto son relating to the great Camisard war of the Cevennes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nEXPLOITS OF CAVALIER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe country round Nismes, which was the scene of so many contests\r\nbetween the Royalists and the Camisard insurgents at the beginning of\r\nlast century, presents nearly the same aspect as it did then,\r\nexcepting that it is traversed by railways in several directions. The\r\nrailway to Montpellier on the west, crosses the fertile valley of the\r\nVaunage, \"the little Canaan,\" still rich in vineyards as of old. That\r\nto Alais on the north, proceeds for the most part along the valley of\r\nthe Gardon, the names of the successive stations reminding the passing\r\ntraveller of the embittered contests of which they were the scenes in\r\nformer times: Nozières, Boucoiran, Ners, Vezenobres, and Alais itself,\r\nnow a considerable manufacturing town, and the centre of an important\r\ncoal-mining district.\r\n\r\nThe country in the neighbourhood of Nismes is by no means picturesque.\r\nThough undulating, it is barren, arid, and stony. The view from the\r\nTour Magne, which is very extensive, is over an apparently skeleton\r\nlandscape, the bare rocks rising on all sides without any covering of\r\nverdure. In summer the grass is parched and brown. There are few trees\r\nvisible; and these mostly mulberry, which, when, cropped, have a\r\nblasted look. Yet, wherever soil exists, in the bottoms, the land is\r\nvery productive, yielding olives, grapes, and chestnuts in great\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\nAs we ascend the valley of the Gardon, the country becomes more\r\nundulating and better wooded. The villages and farmhouses have all an\r\nold-fashioned look; not a modern villa is to be seen. We alight from\r\nthe train at the Ners station--Ners, where Cavalier drove Montrevel's\r\narmy across the river, and near which, at the village of Martinargues,\r\nhe completely defeated the Royalists under Lajonquière. We went to see\r\nthe scene of the battle, some three miles to the south-east, passing\r\nthrough a well-tilled country, with the peasants busily at work in the\r\nfields. From the high ground behind Ners a fine view is obtained of\r\nthe valley of the Gardon, overlooking the junction of its two branches\r\ndescending by Alais and Anduze, the mountains of the Cevennes rising\r\nup in the distance. To the left is the fertile valley of Beaurivage,\r\ncelebrated in the Pastorals of Florian, who was a native of the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nDescending the hill towards Ners, we were overtaken by an aged peasant\r\nof the village, with a scythe over his shoulder, returning from his\r\nmorning's work. There was the usual polite greeting and exchange of\r\nsalutations--for the French peasant is by nature polite--and a ready\r\nopening was afforded for conversation. It turned out that the old man\r\nhad been a soldier of the first empire, and fought under Soult in the\r\ndesperate battle of Toulouse in 1814. He was now nearly eighty, but\r\nwas still able to do a fair day's work in the fields. Inviting us to\r\nenter his dwelling and partake of his hospitality, he went down to his\r\ncellar and fetched therefrom a jug of light sparkling wine, of which\r\nwe partook. In answer to an inquiry whether there were any Protestants\r\nin the neighbourhood, the old man replied that Ners was \"all\r\nProtestant.\" His grandson, however, who was present, qualified this\r\nsweeping statement by the remark, _sotto voce_, that many of them were\r\n\"nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation then turned upon the subject of Cavalier and his\r\nexploits, when our entertainer launched out into a description of the\r\nbattle of Martinargues, in which the Royalists had been \"toutes\r\nabattus.\" Like most of the Protestant peasantry of the Cevennes, he\r\ndisplayed a very familiar acquaintance with the events of the civil\r\nwar, and spoke with enthusiasm and honest pride of the achievements of\r\nthe Camisards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have in previous chapters described the outbreak of the\r\ninsurrection and its spread throughout the Upper Cevennes; and we have\r\nnow rapidly to note its growth and progress to its culmination and\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nWhile the Camisards were secretly organizing their forces under cover\r\nof the woods and caves of the mountain districts, the governor of\r\nLanguedoc was indulging in the hope that the insurrection had expired\r\nwith the death of Laporte and the dispersion of his band. But, to his\r\nimmense surprise, the whole country was suddenly covered with\r\ninsurgents, who seemed as if to spring from the earth in all quarters\r\nsimultaneously. Messengers brought him intelligence at the same time\r\nof risings in the mountains of the Lozère and the Aigoal, in the\r\nneighbourhoods of Anduze and Alais, and even in the open country about\r\nNismes and Calvisson, down almost to the sea-coast.\r\n\r\nWherever the churches had been used as garrisons and depositories of\r\narms, they were attacked, stormed, and burnt. Cavalier says he never\r\nmeddled with any church which had not been thus converted into a \"den\r\nof thieves;\" but the other leaders were less scrupulous. Salomon and\r\nAbraham destroyed all the establishments and insignia of their enemies\r\non which they could lay hands--crosses, churches, and presbyteries.\r\nThe curé of Saint-Germain said of Castanet in the Aigoal that he was\r\n\"like a raging torrent.\" Roland and Joany ran from village to village\r\nransacking dwellings, châteaux, churches, and collecting arms. Knowing\r\nevery foot of the country, they rapidly passed by mountain tracks from\r\none village to another; suddenly appearing in the least-expected\r\nquarters, while the troops in pursuit of them had passed in other\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nCavalier had even the hardihood to descend upon the low country, and\r\nto ransack the Catholic villages in the neighbourhood of Nismes. By\r\nturns he fought, preached, and sacked churches. About the middle of\r\nNovember, 1702, he preached at Aiguevives, a village not far from\r\nCalvisson, in the Vaunage. Count Broglie, commander of the royal\r\ntroops, hastened from Nismes to intercept him. But pursuing Cavalier\r\nwas like pursuing a shadow; he had already made his escape into the\r\nmountains. Broglie assembled the inhabitants of the village in the\r\nchurch, and demanded to be informed who had been present with the\r\nCamisard preacher. \"All!\" was the reply: \"we are all guilty.\" He\r\nseized the principal persons of the place and sent them to Baville.\r\nFour were hanged, twelve were sent to the galleys, many more were\r\nflogged, and a heavy fine was levied on the entire village.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Cavalier had joined Roland near Mialet, and again descended\r\nupon the low country, marching through the villages along the valley\r\nof the Vidourle, carrying off arms and devastating churches. Broglie\r\nsent two strong bodies of troops to intercept them; but the\r\nlight-footed insurgents had already crossed the Gardon.\r\n\r\nA few days later (December 5th), they were lying concealed in the\r\nforest of Vaquières, in the neighbourhood of Cavalier's head-quarters\r\nat Euzet. Their retreat having been discovered, a strong force of\r\nsoldiers and militia was directed upon them, under the command of the\r\nChevalier Montarnaud (who, being a new convert, wished to show his\r\nzeal), and Captain Bimard of the Nismes militia.\r\n\r\nThey took with them a herdsman of the neighbourhood for their guide,\r\nnot knowing that he was a confederate of the Camisards. Leading the\r\nRoyalists into the wood, he guided them along a narrow ravine, and\r\nhearing no sound of the insurgents, it was supposed that they were\r\nlying asleep in their camp.\r\n\r\nSuddenly three sentinels on the outlook fired off their pieces. At\r\nthis signal Ravenel posted himself at the outlet of the defile, and\r\nCavalier and Catinat along its two sides. Raising their war-song, the\r\nsixty-eighth psalm the Camisards furiously charged the enemy. Captain\r\nBimard fell at the first fire. Montarnaud turned and fled with such of\r\nthe soldiers and militia as could follow him; and not many of them\r\nsucceeded in making their escape from the wood.\r\n\r\n\"After which complete victory,\" says Cavalier, \"we returned to the\r\nfield of battle to give our hearty thanks to Almighty God for his\r\nextraordinary assistance, and afterwards stripped the corpses of the\r\nenemy, and secured their arms. We found a purse of one hundred\r\npistoles in Captain Bimard's pocket, which was very acceptable, for we\r\nstood in great need thereof, and expended part of it in buying hats,\r\nshoes, and stockings for those who wanted them, and with the\r\nremainder bought six great mule loads of brandy, for our winter's\r\nsupply, from a merchant who was sending it to be sold at Anduze\r\nmarket.\"[41]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 41: \"Memoirs of the Wars of the Cevennes,\" p. 74.]\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday following, Cavalier held an assembly for public worship\r\nnear Monteze on the Gardon, at which about five hundred persons were\r\npresent. The governor of Alais, being informed of the meeting,\r\nresolved to put it down with a strong hand; and he set out for the\r\npurpose at the head of a force of about six hundred horse and foot. A\r\nmule accompanied him, laden with ropes with which to bind or hang the\r\nrebels. Cavalier had timely information, from scouts posted on the\r\nadjoining hills, of the approach of the governor's force, and though\r\nthe number of fighting men in the Camisard assembly was comparatively\r\nsmall, they resolved to defend themselves.\r\n\r\nSending away the women and others not bearing arms, Cavalier posted\r\nhis little band behind an old entrenchment on the road along which the\r\ngovernor was approaching, and awaited his attack. The horsemen came on\r\nat the charge; but the Camisards, firing over the top of the\r\nentrenchment, emptied more than a dozen saddles, and then leaping\r\nforward, saluted them with a general discharge. At this, the horsemen\r\nturned and fled, galloping through the foot coming up behind them, and\r\nthrowing them into complete disorder. The Camisards pulled off their\r\ncoats, in order the better to pursue the fugitives.\r\n\r\nThe Royalists were in full flight, when they were met by a\r\nreinforcement of two hundred men of Marsilly's regiment of foot. But\r\nthese, too, were suddenly seized by the panic, and turned and fled\r\nwith the rest, the Camisards pursuing them for nearly an hour, in the\r\ncourse of which they slew more than a hundred of the enemy. Besides\r\nthe soldiers' clothes, of which they stripped the dead, the Camisards\r\nmade prize of two loads of ammunition and a large quantity of arms,\r\nwhich they were very much in need of, and also of the ropes with which\r\nthe governor had intended to hang them.\r\n\r\nEmboldened by these successes, Cavalier determined on making an attack\r\non the strong castle of Servas, occupying a steep height on the east\r\nof the forest of Bouquet. Cavalier detested the governor and garrison\r\nof this place because they too closely watched his movements, and\r\noverlooked his head-quarters, which were in the adjoining forest; and\r\nthey had, besides, distinguished themselves by the ferocity with which\r\nthey attacked and dispersed recent assemblies in the Desert.\r\n\r\nCavalier was, however, without the means of directly assaulting the\r\nplace, and he waited for an opportunity of entering it, if possible,\r\nby stratagem. While passing along the road between Alais and Lussan\r\none day, he met a detachment of about forty men of the royal army,\r\nwhom he at once attacked, killing a number of them, and putting the\r\nrest to flight. Among the slain was the commanding officer of the\r\nparty, in whose pockets was found an order signed by Count Broglie\r\ndirecting all town-majors and consuls to lodge him and his men along\r\ntheir line of march. Cavalier at once determined on making use of this\r\norder as a key to open the gates of the castle of Servas.\r\n\r\nHe had twelve of his men dressed up in the clothes of the soldiers who\r\nhad fallen, and six others in their ordinary Camisard dress bound with\r\nropes as prisoners of war. Cavalier himself donned the uniform of the\r\nfallen officer; and thus disguised and well armed, the party moved up\r\nthe steep ascent to the castle. On reaching the outer gate Cavalier\r\npresented the order of Count Broglie, and requested admittance for the\r\npurpose of keeping his pretended Camisard prisoners in safe custody\r\nfor the night. He was at once admitted with his party. The governor\r\nshowed him round the ramparts, pointing out the strength of the place,\r\nand boasting of the punishments he had inflicted on the rebels.\r\n\r\nAt supper Cavalier's soldiers took care to drop into the room, one by\r\none, apparently for orders, and suddenly, on a signal being given, the\r\ngovernor and his attendants were seized and bound. At the same time\r\nthe guard outside was attacked and overpowered. The outer gates were\r\nopened, the Camisards rushed in, the castle was taken, and the\r\ngarrison put to the sword.\r\n\r\nCavalier and his band carried off with them to their magazine at\r\nBouquet all the arms, ammunition, and provisions they could find, and\r\nbefore leaving they set fire to the castle. There must have been a\r\nlarge store of gunpowder in the vaults of the place besides what the\r\nCamisards carried away, for they had scarcely proceeded a mile on\r\ntheir return journey when a tremendous explosion took place, shaking\r\nthe ground like an earthquake, and turning back, they saw the\r\nbattlements of the detested Château Servas hurled into the air.\r\n\r\nShortly after, Roland repeated at Sauvé, a little fortified town hung\r\nalong the side of a rocky hill a few miles to the south of Anduze, the\r\nstratagem which Cavalier had employed at Servas, and with like\r\nsuccess. He disarmed the inhabitants, and carried off the arms and\r\nprovisions in the place: and though he released the commandant and\r\nthe soldiers whom he had taken prisoners, he shot a persecuting priest\r\nand a Capuchin monk, and destroyed all the insignia of Popery in\r\nSauvé.\r\n\r\nThese terrible measures caused a new stampede of the clergy all over\r\nthe Cevennes. The nobles and gentry also left their châteaux, the\r\nmerchants their shops and warehouses, and took refuge in the fortified\r\ntowns. Even the bishops of Mende, Uzes, and Alais barricaded and\r\nfortified their episcopal palaces, and organized a system of defence\r\nas if the hordes of Attila had been at their gates.\r\n\r\nWith each fresh success the Camisards increased in daring, and every\r\nday the insurrection became more threatening and formidable. It\r\nalready embraced the whole mountain district of the Cevennes, as well\r\nas a considerable extent of the low country between Nismes and\r\nMontpellier. The Camisard troops, headed by their chiefs, marched\r\nthrough the villages with drums beating in open day, and were\r\nquartered by billet on the inhabitants in like manner as the royal\r\nregiments. Roland levied imposts and even tithes throughout his\r\ndistrict, and compelled the farmers, at the peril of their lives, to\r\nbring their stores of victual to the \"Camp of the Eternal.\" In the\r\nmidst of all, they held their meetings in the Desert, at which the\r\nchiefs preached, baptized, and administered the sacrament to their\r\nflocks.\r\n\r\nThe constituted authorities seemed paralyzed by the extent of the\r\ninsurrection, and the suddenness with which it spread. The governor of\r\nthe province had so repeatedly reported to his royal master the\r\npacification of Languedoc, that when this last and worst outbreak\r\noccurred he was ashamed to announce it. The peace at Ryswick had set at\r\nliberty a large force of soldiers, who had now no other occupation than\r\nto \"convert\" the Protestants and force them to attend Mass. About five\r\nhundred thousand men were now under arms for this purpose--occupied as a\r\nsort of police force, very much to their own degradation as soldiers.\r\n\r\nA large body of this otherwise unoccupied army had been placed under\r\nthe direction of Baville for the purpose of suppressing the\r\nrebellion--an army of veteran horse and foot, whose valour had been\r\ntried in many hard-fought battles. Surely it was not to be said that\r\nthis immense force could be baffled and defied by a few thousand\r\npeasants, cowherds, and wool-carders, fighting for what they\r\nridiculously called their \"rights of conscience!\" Baville could not\r\nbelieve it; and he accordingly determined again to apply himself more\r\nvigorously than ever to the suppression of the insurrection, by means\r\nof the ample forces placed at his disposal.\r\n\r\nAgain the troops were launched against the insurgents, and again and\r\nagain they were baffled in their attempts to overtake and crush them.\r\nThe soldiers became worn out by forced marches, in running from one\r\nplace to another to disperse assemblies in the Desert. They were\r\ndistracted by the number of places in which the rebels made their\r\nappearance. Cavalier ran from town to town, making his attacks\r\nsometimes late at night, sometimes in the early morning; but before\r\nthe troops could come up he had done all the mischief he intended, and\r\nwas perhaps fifty miles distant on another expedition. If the\r\nRoyalists divided themselves into small bodies, they were in danger of\r\nbeing overpowered; and if they kept together in large bodies, they\r\nmoved about with difficulty, and could not overtake the insurgents,\r\n\"by reason,\" said Cavalier, \"we could go further in three hours than\r\nthey could in a whole day; regular troops not being used to march\r\nthrough woods and mountains as we did.\"\r\n\r\nAt length the truth could not be concealed any longer. The States of\r\nLanguedoc were summoned to meet at Montpellier, and there the\r\ndesperate state of affairs was fully revealed. The bishops of the\r\nprincipal dioceses could with difficulty attend the meeting, and were\r\nonly enabled to do so by the assistance of strong detachments of\r\nsoldiers--the Camisards being masters of the principal roads. They\r\nfilled the assembly with their lamentations, and declared that they\r\nhad been betrayed by the men in power. At their urgent solicitation,\r\nthirty-two more companies of Catholic fusiliers and another regiment\r\nof dragoons were ordered to be immediately embodied in the district.\r\nThe governor also called to his aid an additional regiment of dragoons\r\nfrom Rouergue; a battalion of marines from the ships-of-war lying at\r\nMarseilles and Toulon; a body of Miguelets from Roussillon, accustomed\r\nto mountain warfare; together with a large body of Irish officers and\r\nsoldiers, part of the Irish Brigade.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd how did it happen that the self-exiled Irish patriots were now in\r\nthe Cevennes, helping the army of Louis XIV. to massacre the Camisards\r\nby way of teaching them a better religion? It happened thus: The\r\nbanishment of the Huguenots from France, and their appearance under\r\nWilliam III. in Ireland to fight at the Boyne and Augrhim, contributed\r\nto send the Irish Brigade over to France--though it must be confessed\r\nthat the Irish Brigade fought much better for Louis XIV. than they had\r\never done for Ireland.\r\n\r\nAfter the surrender of Limerick in 1691, the principal number of the\r\nIrish followers of James II. declared their intention of abandoning\r\nIreland and serving their sovereign's ally the King of France. The\r\nIrish historians allege that the number of the brigade at first\r\namounted to nearly thirty thousand men.[42] Though, they fought\r\nbravely for France, and conducted themselves valiantly in many of her\r\ngreat battles, they were unfortunately put forward to do a great deal\r\nof dirty work for Louis XIV. One of the first campaigns they were\r\nengaged in was in Savoy, under Catinat, in repressing the Vaudois or\r\nBarbets.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 42: O'Callaghan's \"History of the Irish Brigades in\r\n         the service of France,\" p. 29.]\r\n\r\nThe Vaudois peasantry were for the most part unarmed, and their only\r\ncrime was their religion. The regiments of Viscount Clare and Viscount\r\nDillon, principally distinguished themselves against the Vaudois. The\r\nwar was one of extermination, in which many of the Barbets were\r\nkilled. Mr. O'Connor states that between the number of the Alpine\r\nmountaineers cut off, and the extent of devastation and pillage\r\ncommitted amongst them by the Irish, Catinat's commission was executed\r\nwith terrible fidelity; the memory of which \"has rendered their name\r\nand nation odious to the Vaudois. Six generations,\" he remarks, \"have\r\nsince passed, away, but neither time nor subsequent calamities have\r\nobliterated the impression made by the waste and desolation of this\r\nmilitary incursion.\"[43] Because of the outrages and destruction\r\ncommitted upon the women and children in the valleys in the absence of\r\ntheir natural defenders, the Vaudois still speak of the Irish as \"the\r\nforeign assassins.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 43: Ibid., p. 180.]\r\n\r\nThe Brigade having thus faithfully served Louis XIV. in Piedmont,\r\nwere now occupied in the same work in the Cevennes. The historian of\r\nthe Brigade does not particularise the battles in which they were\r\nengaged with the Camisards, but merely announces that \"on several\r\noccasions, the Irish appear to have distinguished themselves,\r\nespecially their officers.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Cavalier heard of the vast additional forces about to be thrown\r\ninto the Cevennes, he sought to effect a diversion by shifting the\r\ntheatre of war. Marching down towards the low country with about two\r\nhundred men, he went from village to village in the Vaunage, holding\r\nassemblies of the people. His whereabouts soon became known to the\r\nRoyalists, and Captain Bonnafoux, of the Calvisson militia, hearing\r\nthat Cavalier was preaching one day at the village of St. Comes,\r\nhastened to capture him.\r\n\r\nBonnafoux had already distinguished himself in the preceding year, by\r\nsabring two assemblies surprised by him at Vauvert and Caudiac, and\r\nhis intention now was to serve Cavalier and his followers in like\r\nmanner. Galloping up to the place of meeting, the Captain was\r\nchallenged by the Camisard sentinel; and his answer was to shoot the\r\nman dead with his pistol. The report alarmed the meeting, then\r\noccupied in prayer; but rising from their knees, they at once formed\r\nin line and advanced to meet the foe, who turned and fled at their\r\nfirst discharge.\r\n\r\nCavalier next went southward to Caudiac, where he waited for an\r\nopportunity of surprising Aimargues, and putting to the sword the\r\nmilitia, who had long been the scourge of the Protestants in that\r\nquarter. He entered the latter town on a fair day, and walked about\r\namongst the people; but, finding that his intention was known, and\r\nthat his enterprise was not likely to succeed, he turned aside and\r\nresolved upon another course. But first it was necessary that his\r\ntroops should be supplied with powder and ammunition, of which they\r\nhad run short. So, disguising himself as a merchant, and mounted on a\r\nhorse with capacious saddlebags, he rode off to Nismes, close at hand,\r\nto buy gunpowder. He left his men in charge of his two lieutenants,\r\nRavanel and Catinat, who prophesied to him that during his absence\r\nthey would fight a battle and win a victory.\r\n\r\nCount Broglie had been promptly informed by the defeated Captain\r\nBonnafoux that the Camisards were in the neighbourhood; and he set out\r\nin pursuit of them with a strong body of horse and foot. After several\r\ndays' search amongst the vineyards near Nismes and the heathery hills\r\nabout Milhaud, Broglie learnt that the Camisards were to be found at\r\nCaudiac. But when he reached that place he found the insurgents had\r\nalready left, and taken a northerly direction. Broglie followed their\r\ntrack, and on the following day came up with them at a place called\r\nMas de Gaffarel, in the Val de Bane, about three miles west of Nismes,\r\nThe Royalists consisted of two hundred militia, commanded by the Count\r\nand his son, and two troops of dragoons, under Captain la Dourville\r\nand the redoubtable Captain Poul.\r\n\r\nThe Camisards had only time to utter a short prayer, and to rise from\r\ntheir knees and advance singing their battle psalm, when Poul and his\r\ndragoons were upon them. Their charge was so furious that Ravanel and\r\nhis men were at first thrown into disorder; but rallying, and bravely\r\nfighting, they held their ground. Captain Poul was brought to the\r\nground by a stone hurled from a sling by a young Vauvert miller named\r\nSamuelet; Count Broglie himself was wounded by a musket-ball, and many\r\nof his dragoons lay stretched on the field. Catinat observing the fall\r\nof Poul, rushed forward, cut off his head with a sweep of his sabre,\r\nand mounting Poul's horse, almost alone chased the Royalists, now\r\nflying in all directions. Broglie did not draw breath until he had\r\nreached the secure shelter of the castle of Bernis.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were in progress, Cavalier was occupied on his\r\nmission of buying gunpowder in Nismes. He was passing along the\r\nEsplanade--then, as now, a beautiful promenade--when he observed from\r\nthe excitement of the people, running about hither and thither, that\r\nsomething alarming had occurred. On making inquiry he was told that\r\n\"the Barbets\" were in the immediate neighbourhood, and it was even\r\nfeared they would enter and sack the city. Shortly after, a trooper\r\nwas observed galloping towards them at full speed along the\r\nMontpellier Road, without arms or helmet. He was almost out of breath\r\nwhen he came up, and could only exclaim that \"All is lost! Count\r\nBroglie and Captain Poul are killed, and the Barbets are pursuing the\r\nremainder of the royal troops into the city!\"\r\n\r\nThe gates were at once ordered to be shut and barricaded; the\r\n_générale_ was beaten; the troops and militia were mustered; the\r\npriests ran about in the streets crying, \"We are undone!\" Some of the\r\nRoman Catholics even took shelter in the houses of the Protestants,\r\ncalling upon them to save their lives. But the night passed, and with\r\nit their alarm, for the Camisards did not make their appearance. Next\r\nmorning a message arrived from Count Broglie, shut up in the castle\r\nof Bernis, ordering the garrison to come to his relief.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Cavalier, with the assistance of his friends in\r\nNismes, had obtained the articles of which he was in need, and\r\nprepared to set out on his return journey. The governor and his\r\ndetachment were issuing from the western gate as he left, and he\r\naccompanied them part of the way, still disguised as a merchant, and\r\nmounted on his horse, with a large portmanteau behind him, and\r\nsaddlebags on either side full of gunpowder and ammunition. The\r\nCamisard chief mixed with the men, talking with them freely about the\r\nBarbets and their doings. When he came to the St. Hypolite road he\r\nturned aside; but they warned him that if he went that way he would\r\ncertainly fall into the hands of the Barbets, and lose not only his\r\nhorse and his merchandise, but his life. Cavalier thanked them for\r\ntheir advice, but said he was not afraid of the Barbets, and proceeded\r\non his way, shortly rejoining his troop at the appointed rendez-vous.\r\n\r\nThe Camisards crossed the Gardon by the bridge of St. Nicholas, and\r\nwere proceeding towards their head-quarters at Bouquet, up the left\r\nbank of the river, when an attempt was made by the Chevalier de St.\r\nChaptes, at the head of the militia of the district, to cut off their\r\nretreat. But Ravanel charged them with such fury as to drive the\r\ngreater part into the Gardon, then swollen by a flood, and those who\r\ndid not escape by swimming were either killed or drowned.\r\n\r\nThus the insurrection seemed to grow, notwithstanding all the measures\r\ntaken to repress it. The number of soldiers stationed in the province\r\nwas from time to time increased; they were scattered in detachments\r\nall over the country, and the Camisards took care to give them but\r\nfew opportunities of exhibiting their force, and then only when at a\r\ncomparative disadvantage. The Royalists, at their wits' end,\r\nconsidered what was next to be done in order to the pacification of\r\nthe country. The simple remedy, they knew, was to allow these poor\r\nsimple people to worship in their own way without molestation. Grant\r\nthem this privilege, and they were at any moment ready to lay down\r\ntheir arms, and resume their ordinary peaceful pursuits.\r\n\r\nBut this was precisely what the King would not allow. To do so would\r\nbe an admission of royal fallibility which neither he nor his advisers\r\nwere prepared to make. To enforce conformity on his subjects, Louis\r\nXIV. had already driven some half-a-million of the best of them into\r\nexile, besides the thousands who had perished on gibbets, in dungeons,\r\nor at the galleys. And was he now to confess, by granting liberty of\r\nworship to these neatherds, carders, and peasants, that the rigorous\r\npolicy of \"the Most Christian King\" had been an entire mistake?\r\n\r\nIt was resolved, therefore, that no such liberty should be granted,\r\nand that these peasants, like the rest of the King's subjects, were to\r\nbe forced, at the sword's point if necessary, to worship God in _his_\r\nway, and not in theirs. Viewed in this light, the whole proceeding\r\nwould appear to be a ludicrous absurdity, but for its revolting\r\nimpiety and the abominable cruelties with which it was accompanied.\r\nYet the Royalists even blamed themselves for the mercy which they had\r\nhitherto shown to the Protestant peasantry; and the more virulent\r\namongst them urged that the whole of the remaining population that\r\nwould not at once conform to the Church of Rome, should forthwith be\r\nput to the sword!\r\n\r\nBrigadier Julien, an apostate Protestant, who had served under William\r\nof Orange in Ireland, and afterwards under the Duke of Savoy in\r\nPiedmont, disappointed with the slowness of his promotion, had taken\r\nservice under Louis XIV., and was now employed as a partizan chief in\r\nthe suppression of his former co-religionists in Languedoc. Like all\r\nrenegades, he was a bitter and furious persecutor; and in the councils\r\nof Baville his voice was always raised for the extremest measures. He\r\nwould utterly exterminate the insurgents, and, if necessary, reduce\r\nthe country to a desert. \"It is not enough,\" said he, \"merely to kill\r\nthose bearing arms; the villages which supply the combatants, and\r\nwhich give them shelter and sustenance, ought to be burnt down: thus\r\nonly can the insurrection be suppressed.\"\r\n\r\nIn a military point of view Julien was probably right; but the savage\r\nadvice startled even Baville. \"Nothing can be easier,\" said he, \"than\r\nto destroy the towns and villages; but this would be to make a desert\r\nof one of the finest and most productive districts of Languedoc.\" Yet\r\nBaville himself eventually adopted the very policy which he now\r\ncondemned.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, however, it was determined to pursue and destroy\r\nCavalier and his band. Eight hundred men, under the Count de Touman,\r\nwere posted at Uzes; two battalions of the regiment of Hainault, under\r\nJulien, at Anduze; while Broglie, with a strong body of dragoons and\r\nmilitia, commanded the passes at St. Ambrose. These troops occupied,\r\nas it were, the three sides of a triangle, in the centre of which\r\nCavalier was known to be in hiding in the woods of Bouquet. Converging\r\nupon him simultaneously, they hoped to surround and destroy him.\r\n\r\nBut the Camisard chief was well advised of their movements. To draw\r\nthem away from his magazines, Cavalier marched boldly to the north,\r\nand slipping through between the advancing forces, he got into\r\nBroglie's rear, and set fire to two villages inhabited by Catholics.\r\nThe three bodies at once directed themselves upon the burning\r\nvillages; but when they reached them Cavalier had made his escape, and\r\nwas nowhere to be heard of. For four days they hunted the country\r\nbetween the Garden and the Ceze, beating the woods and exploring the\r\ncaves; and then they returned, harassed and vexed, to their respective\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nWhile the Royalists were thus occupied, Cavalier fell upon a convoy of\r\nprovisions which Colonel Marsilly was leading to the castle of\r\nMendajols, scattered and killed the escort, and carried off the mules\r\nand their loads to the magazines at Bouquet. During the whole of the\r\nmonth of January, the Camisards, notwithstanding the inclemency of the\r\nweather, were constantly on the move, making their appearance in the\r\nmost unexpected quarters; Roland descending from Mialet on Anduze, and\r\nrousing Broglie from his slumbers by a midnight fusillade; Castanet\r\nattacking St. André, and making a bonfire of the contents of the\r\nchurch; Joany disarming Genouillac; and Lafleur terrifying the\r\nvillages of the Lozère almost to the gates of Mende.\r\n\r\nAlthough the winters in the South of France, along the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, are comparatively mild and genial, it is very different\r\nin the mountain districts of the interior, where the snow lies thick\r\nupon the ground, and the rivers are bound up by frost. Cavalier, in\r\nhis Memoirs, describes the straits to which his followers were reduced\r\nin that inclement season, being \"destitute of houses or beds,\r\nvictuals, bread, or money, and left to struggle with hunger, cold,\r\nsnow, misery, and poverty.\"\r\n\r\n     \"General Broglie,\" he continues, \"believed and hoped that though\r\n     he had not been able to destroy us with the sword, yet the\r\n     insufferable miseries of the winter would do him that good\r\n     office. Yet God Almighty prevented it through his power, and by\r\n     unexpected means his Providence ordered the thing so well that at\r\n     the end of the winter we found ourselves in being, and in a\r\n     better condition than we expected.... As for our retiring places,\r\n     we were used in the night-time to go into hamlets or sheepfolds\r\n     built in or near the woods, and thought ourselves happy when we\r\n     lighted upon a stone or piece of timber to make our pillows\r\n     withal, and a little straw or dry leaves to lie upon in our\r\n     clothes. We did in this condition sleep as gently and soundly as\r\n     if we had lain upon a down bed. The weather being extremely cold,\r\n     we had a great occasion for fire; but residing mostly in woods,\r\n     we used to get great quantity of faggots and kindle them, and so\r\n     sit round about them and warm ourselves. In this manner we spent\r\n     a quarter of a year, running up and down, sometimes one way and\r\n     sometimes another, through great forests and upon high mountains,\r\n     in deep snow and upon ice. And notwithstanding the sharpness of\r\n     the weather, the small stock of our provisions, and the marches\r\n     and counter-marches we were continually obliged to make, and\r\n     which gave us but seldom the opportunity of washing the only\r\n     shirt we had upon our back, not one amongst us fell sick. One\r\n     might have perceived in our visage a complexion as fresh as if we\r\n     had fed upon the most delicious meats, and at the end of the\r\n     season we found ourselves in a good disposition heartily to\r\n     commence the following campaign.\"[44]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 44: Cavalier's \"Memoirs of the Wars of the\r\n         Cevennes,\" pp. 111-114.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1703, the third year of the insurrection, began\r\nunfavourably for the Camisards. The ill-success of Count Broglie as\r\ncommander of the royal forces in the Cevennes, determined Louis\r\nXIV.--from whom the true state of affairs could no longer be\r\nconcealed--to supersede him by Marshal Montrevel, one of the ablest of\r\nhis generals. The army of Languedoc was again reinforced by ten\r\nthousand of the best soldiers of France, drawn from the armies of\r\nGermany and Italy. It now consisted of three regiments of dragoons and\r\ntwenty-four battalions of foot--of the Irish Brigade, the Miguelets,\r\nand the Languedoc fusiliers--which, with the local militia,\r\nconstituted an effective force of not less than sixty thousand men!\r\n\r\nSuch was the irresistible army, commanded by a marshal of France,\r\nthree lieutenant-generals, three major-generals, and three\r\nbrigadier-generals, now stationed in Languedoc, to crush the peasant\r\ninsurrection. No wonder that the Camisard chiefs were alarmed when the\r\nintelligence reached them of this formidable force having been set in\r\nmotion for their destruction.\r\n\r\nThe first thing they determined upon was to effect a powerful\r\ndiversion, and to extend, if possible, the area of the insurrection.\r\nFor this purpose, Cavalier, at the head of eight hundred men,\r\naccompanied by thirty baggage mules, set out in the beginning of\r\nFebruary, with the object of raising the Viverais, the north-eastern\r\nquarter of Languedoc, where the Camisards had numerous partizans. The\r\nsnow was lying thick upon the ground when they set out; but the little\r\narmy pushed northward, through Rochegude and Barjac. At the town of\r\nVagnas they found their way barred by a body of six hundred militia,\r\nunder the Count de Roure. These they attacked with great fury and\r\nspeedily put to flight.\r\n\r\nBut behind the Camisarde was a second and much stronger royalist\r\nforce, eighteen hundred men, under Brigadier Julien, who had hastened\r\nup from Lussan upon Cavalier's track, and now hung upon his rear in\r\nthe forest of Vagnas. Next morning the Camisards accepted battle,\r\nfought with their usual bravery, but having been trapped into an\r\nambuscade, they were overpowered by numbers, and at length broke and\r\nfled in disorder, leaving behind them their mules, baggage, seven\r\ndrums, and a quantity of arms, with some two hundred dead and\r\nwounded. Cavalier himself escaped with difficulty, and, after having\r\nbeen given up for lost, reached the rendez-vous at Bouquet in a state\r\nof complete exhaustion, Ravanel and Catinat having preceded him\r\nthither with, the remains of his broken army.\r\n\r\nRoland and Cavalier now altered their tactics. They resolved to avoid\r\npitched battles such as that at Vagnas, where they were liable to be\r\ncrushed at a blow, and to divide their forces into small detachments\r\nconstantly on the move, harassing the enemy, interrupting their\r\ncommunications, and falling upon detached bodies whenever an\r\nopportunity for an attack presented itself.\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of Montrevel, who supposed the Camisards finally\r\ncrushed at Vagnas, the intelligence suddenly reached him of a\r\nmultitude of attacks on fortified posts, burning of châteaux and\r\nchurches, captures of convoys, and defeats of detached bodies of\r\nRoyalists.\r\n\r\nJoany attacked Genouillac, cut to pieces the militia who defended it,\r\nand carried off their arms and ammunition, with other spoils, to the\r\ncamp at Faux-des-Armes. Shortly after, in one of his incursions, he\r\ncaptured a convoy of forty mules laden with cloth, wine, and\r\nprovisions for Lent; and, though hotly pursued by a much superior\r\nforce, he succeeded in making his escape into the mountains.\r\n\r\nCastanet was not less active in the west--sacking and burning Catholic\r\nvillages, and putting their inhabitants to the sword by way of\r\nreprisal for similar atrocities committed by the Royalists. At the\r\nsame time, Montrevel pillaged and burned Euzet and St. Jean de\r\nCeirarges, villages inhabited by Protestants; and there was not a\r\nhamlet but was liable at any moment to be sacked and destroyed by one\r\nor other of the contending parties.\r\n\r\nNor was Roland idle. Being greatly in want of arms and ammunition, as\r\nwell as of shoes and clothes for his men, he collected a considerable\r\nforce, and made a descent, for the purpose of obtaining them, on the\r\nrich and populous towns of the south; more particularly on the\r\nmanufacturing town of Ganges, where the Camisards had many friends.\r\nAlthough Roland, to divert the attention of Montrevel from Ganges,\r\nsent a detachment of his men into the neighbourhood of Nismes to raise\r\nthe alarm there, it was not long before a large royalist force was\r\ndirected against him.\r\n\r\nHearing that Montrevel was marching upon Ganges, Roland hastily left\r\nfor the north, but was overtaken near Pompignan by the marshal at the\r\nhead of an army of regular horse and foot, including several regiments\r\nof local militia, Miguelets, marines, and Irish. The Royalists were\r\nposted in such a manner as to surround the Camisards, who, though they\r\nfought with their usual impetuosity, and succeeded in breaking through\r\nthe ranks of their enemies, suffered a heavy loss in dead and wounded.\r\nRoland himself escaped with difficulty, and with his broken forces\r\nfled through Durfort to his stronghold at Mialet.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle, Marshal Montrevel returned to Ganges, where he\r\nlevied a fine of ten thousand livres on the Protestant population,\r\ngiving up their houses to pillage, and hanging a dozen of those who\r\nhad been the most prominent in abetting the Camisards during their\r\nrecent visit. At the game time, he reported to head-quarters at Paris\r\nthat he had entirely destroyed the rebels, and that Languedoc was now\r\n\"pacified.\"\r\n\r\nMuch to his surprise, however, not many weeks elapsed before\r\nCavalier, who had been laid up by the small-pox during Roland's\r\nexpedition to Ganges, again appeared in the field, attacking convoys,\r\nentering the villages and carrying off arms, and spreading terror anew\r\nto the very gates of Nismes. He returned northwards by the valley of\r\nthe Rhône, driving before him flocks and herds for the provisioning of\r\nhis men, and reached his retreat at Bouquet in safety. Shortly after,\r\nhe issued from it again, and descended upon Ners, where he destroyed a\r\ndetachment of troops under Colonel de Jarnaud; next day he crossed the\r\nGardon, and cut up a reinforcement intended for the garrison of\r\nSommières; and the day after he was heard of in another place,\r\nattacking a convoy, and carrying off arms, ammunition, and provisions.\r\n\r\nMontrevel was profoundly annoyed at the failure of his efforts thus\r\nfar to suppress the insurrection. It even seemed to increase and\r\nextend with every new measure taken to crush it. A marshal of France,\r\nat the head of sixty thousand men, he feared lest he should lose\r\ncredit with his friends at court unless he were able at once to root\r\nout these miserable cowherds and wool-carders who continued to bid\r\ndefiance to the royal authority which he represented; and he\r\ndetermined to exert himself with renewed vigour to exterminate them\r\nroot and branch.\r\n\r\nIn this state of irritation the intelligence was one day brought to\r\nthe marshal while sitting over his wine after dinner at Nismes, that\r\nan assembly of Huguenots was engaged in worship in a mill situated on\r\nthe canal outside the Port-des-Carmes. He at once ordered out a\r\nbattalion of foot, marched on the mill, and surrounded it. The\r\nsoldiers burst open the door, and found from two to three hundred\r\nwomen, children, and old men engaged in prayer; and proceeded to put\r\nthem to the sword. But the marshal, impatient at the slowness of the\r\nbutchery, ordered the men to desist and to fire the place. This order\r\nwas obeyed, and the building, being for the most part of wood, was\r\nsoon wrapped in flames, from amidst which rose the screams of women\r\nand children. All who tried to escape were bayoneted, or driven back\r\ninto the burning mill. Every soul perished--all excepting a girl, who\r\nwas rescued by one of Montrevel's servants. But the pitiless marshal\r\nordered both the girl and her deliverer to be put to death. The former\r\nwas hanged forthwith, but the lackey's life was spared at the\r\nintercession of some sisters of mercy accidentally passing the place.\r\n\r\nIn the same savage and relentless spirit, Montrevel proceeded to\r\nextirpate the Huguenots wherever found. He caused all suspected\r\npersons in twenty-two parishes in the diocese of Nismes to be seized\r\nand carried off. The men were transported to North America, and the\r\nwomen and children imprisoned in the fortresses of Roussillon.\r\n\r\nBut the most ruthless measures were those which were adopted in the\r\nUpper Cevennes: there nothing short of devastation would satisfy the\r\nmarshal. Thirty-two parishes were completely laid waste; the cattle,\r\ngrain, and produce which they contained were seized and carried into\r\nthe towns of refuge garrisoned by the Royalists--Alais, Anduze,\r\nFlorac, St. Hypolite, and Nismes--so that nothing should be left\r\ncalculated to give sustenance to the rebels. Four hundred and\r\nsixty-six villages and hamlets were reduced to mere heaps of ashes and\r\nblackened ruins, and such of their inhabitants as were not slain by\r\nthe soldiery fled with their families into the wilderness.\r\n\r\nAll the principal villages inhabited by the Protestants were thus\r\ncompletely destroyed, together with their mills and barns, and every\r\nbuilding likely to give them shelter. Mialet was sacked and\r\nburnt--Roland, still suffering from his wounds, being unable to strike\r\na blow in defence of his stronghold. St. Julien was also plundered and\r\nlevelled, and its inhabitants carried captive to Montpellier, where\r\nthe women and children were imprisoned, and the men sent to the\r\ngalleys.\r\n\r\nWhen Cavalier heard of the determination of Montrevel to make a desert\r\nof the country, he sent word to him that for every Huguenot village\r\ndestroyed he would destroy two inhabited by the Romanists. Thus the\r\nsacking and burning on the one side was immediately followed by\r\nincreased sacking and burning on the other. The war became one of\r\nmutual destruction and extermination, and the unfortunate inhabitants\r\non both sides were delivered over to all the horrors of civil war.\r\n\r\nSo far, however, from the Camisards being suppressed, the destruction\r\nof the dwellings of the Huguenots only served to swell their numbers,\r\nand they descended from their mountains upon the Catholics of the\r\nplains in increasing force and redoubled fury. Montlezan was utterly\r\ndestroyed--all but the church, which was strongly barricaded, and\r\nresisted Cavalier's attempts to enter it. Aurillac, also, was in like\r\nmanner sacked and gutted, and the destroying torrent swept over all\r\nthe towns and villages of the Cevennes.\r\n\r\nCavalier was so ubiquitous, so daring, and often so successful in his\r\nattacks, that of all the Camisard leaders he was held to be the most\r\ndangerous, and a high price was accordingly set upon his head by the\r\ngovernor. Hence many attempts were made to betray him. He was haunted\r\nby spies, some of whom even succeeded in obtaining admission to his\r\nranks. More than once the spies were detected--it was pretended\r\nthrough prophetic influence--and immediately shot. But on one occasion\r\nCavalier and his whole force narrowly escaped destruction through the\r\nbetrayal of a pretended follower.\r\n\r\nWhile the Royalists were carrying destruction through the villages of\r\nthe Upper Cevennes, Cavalier, Salomon, and Abraham, in order to divert\r\nthem from their purpose, resolved upon another descent into the low\r\ncountry, now comparatively ungarrisoned. With this object they\r\ngathered together some fifteen hundred men, and descended from the\r\nmountains by Collet, intending to cross the Gardon at Beaurivage. On\r\nSunday, the 29th of April, they halted in the wood of Malaboissière, a\r\nlittle north of Mialet, for a day's preaching and worship; and after\r\nholding three services, which were largely attended, they directed\r\ntheir steps to the Tower of Belliot, a deserted farmhouse on the south\r\nof the present high road between Alais and Anduze.\r\n\r\nThe house had been built on the ruins of a feudal castle, and took its\r\nname from one of the old towers still standing. It was surrounded by a\r\ndry stone wall, forming a court, the entrance to which was closed by\r\nhurdles. On their arrival at this place late at night, the Camisards\r\npartook of the supper which had been prepared for them by their\r\npurveyor on the occasion--a miller of the neighbourhood, named\r\nGuignon--whose fidelity was assured not only by his apparent piety,\r\nbut by the circumstance that two of his sons belonged to Cavalier's\r\nband.\r\n\r\nNo sooner, however, had the Camisards lain down to sleep than the\r\nmiller, possessed by the demon of gold, set out directly for Alais,\r\nabout three miles distant, and, reaching the quarters of Montrevel,\r\nsold the secret of Cavalier's sleeping-place to the marshal for fifty\r\npieces of gold, and together with it the lives of his own sons and\r\ntheir fifteen hundred companions.\r\n\r\nThe marshal forthwith mustered all the available troops in Alais,\r\nconsisting of eight regiments of foot (of which one was Irish) and two\r\nof dragoons, and set out at once for the Tower of Belliot, taking the\r\nprecaution to set a strict guard upon all the gates, to prevent the\r\npossibility of any messenger leaving the place to warn Cavalier of his\r\napproach. The Royalists crept towards the tower in three bodies, so as\r\nto cut off their retreat in every direction. Meanwhile, the Camisards,\r\nunapprehensive of danger, lay wrapped in slumber, filling the tower,\r\nthe barns, the stables, and outhouses.\r\n\r\nThe night was dark, and favoured the Royalists' approach. Suddenly,\r\none of their divisions came upon the advanced Camisard sentinels. They\r\nfired, but were at once cut down. Those behind fled back to the\r\nsleeping camp, and raised the cry of alarm. Cavalier started up,\r\ncalling his men \"to arms,\" and, followed by about four hundred, he\r\nprecipitated himself on the heads of the advancing columns. Driven\r\nback, they rallied again, more troops coming up to their support, and\r\nagain they advanced to the attack.\r\n\r\nTo his dismay, Cavalier found the enemy in overwhelming force,\r\nenveloping his whole position. By great efforts he held them back\r\nuntil some four or five hundred more of his men had joined him, and\r\nthen he gave way and retired behind a ravine or hollow, probably\r\nforming part of the fosse of the ancient château. Having there rallied\r\nhis followers, he recrossed the ravine to make another desperate\r\neffort to relieve the remainder of his troop shut up in the tower.\r\n\r\nA desperate encounter followed, in the midst of which two of the\r\nroyalist columns, mistaking each other for enemies in the darkness,\r\nfired into each other and increased the confusion and the carnage. The\r\nmoon rose on this dreadful scene, and revealed to the Royalists the\r\nsmallness of the force opposed to them. The struggle was renewed again\r\nand again; Cavalier still seeking to relieve those shut up in the\r\ntower, and the Royalists, now concentrated and in force, to surround\r\nand destroy him.\r\n\r\nAt length, after the struggle had lasted for about five hours,\r\nCavalier, in order to save the rest of his men, resolved on retiring\r\nbefore daybreak; and he succeeded in effecting his retreat without\r\nbeing pursued by the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe three hundred Camisards who continued shut up in the tower refused\r\nto surrender. They transformed the ruin into a fortress, barricading\r\nevery entrance, and firing from every loophole. When their ammunition\r\nwas expended, they hurled stones, joists, and tiles down upon their\r\nassailants from the summit of the tower. For four more hours they\r\ncontinued to hold out. Cannon were sent for from Alais, to blow in the\r\ndoors; but before they arrived all was over. The place had been set on\r\nfire by hand grenades, and the imprisoned Camisards, singing psalms\r\namidst the flames to their last breath, perished to a man.\r\n\r\nThis victory cost Montrevel dear. He lost some twelve hundred dead and\r\nwounded before the fatal Tower of Belliot; whilst Cavalier's loss was\r\nnot less than four hundred dead, of whom a hundred and eighteen were\r\nfound at daybreak along the brink of the ravine. One of these was\r\nmistaken for the body of Cavalier; on which Montrevel, with\r\ncharacteristic barbarity, ordered the head to be cut off and sent to\r\n_Cavalier's mother_ for identification!\r\n\r\nFrom the slight glimpses we obtain of the _man_ Montrevel in the\r\ncourse of these deplorable transactions, there seems to have been\r\nsomething ineffably mean and spiteful in his nature. Thus, on another\r\noccasion, in a fit of rage at having been baffled by the young\r\nCamisard leader, he dispatched a squadron of dragoons to Ribaute for\r\nthe express purpose of pulling down the house in which Cavalier had\r\nbeen born!\r\n\r\nA befitting sequel to this sanguinary struggle at the Tower of Belliot\r\nwas the fate of Guignon, the miller, who had betrayed the sleeping\r\nCamisards to Montrevel. His crime was discovered. The gold was found\r\nupon him. He was tried, and condemned to death. The Camisards, under\r\narms, assembled to see the sentence carried out. They knelt round the\r\ndoomed man, while the prophets by turn prayed for his soul, and\r\nimplored the clemency of the Sovereign Judge. Guignon professed the\r\nutmost contrition, besought the pardon of his brethren, and sought\r\nleave to embrace for the last time his two sons--privates in the\r\nCamisard ranks. The two young men, however, refused the proffered\r\nembrace with a gesture of apparent disgust; and they looked on, the\r\nsad and stern spectators of the traitor's punishment.\r\n\r\nAgain Montrevel thought he had succeeded in crushing the insurrection,\r\nand that he had cut off its head with that of the Camisard chief. But\r\nhis supposed discovery of the dead body proved an entire mistake; and\r\nnot many days elapsed before Cavalier made his appearance before the\r\ngates of Alais, and sent in a challenge to the governor to come out\r\nand fight him. And it is to be observed that by this time a fiercely\r\ncombative spirit, of fighting for fighting's sake, began to show\r\nitself among the Camisards. Thus, Castanet appeared one day before the\r\ngates of Meyreuis, where the regiment of Cordes was stationed, and\r\nchallenged the colonel to come out and fight him in the open; but the\r\nchallenge was declined. On another occasion, Cavalier in like manner\r\nchallenged the commander of Vic to bring out thirty of his soldiers\r\nand fight thirty Camisards. The challenge was accepted, and the battle\r\ntook place; they fought until ten men only remained alive on either\r\nside, but the Camisards were masters of the field.\r\n\r\nMontrevel only redoubled his efforts to exterminate the Camisards. He\r\nhad no other policy. In the summer of 1703 the Pope (Clement XI.) came\r\nto his assistance, issuing a bull against the rebels as being of \"the\r\nexecrable race of the ancient Albigenses,\" and promising \"absolute and\r\ngeneral remission of sins\" to all such as should join the holy militia\r\nof Louis XIV. in \"exterminating the cursed heretics and miscreants,\r\nenemies alike of God and of Cæsar.\"\r\n\r\nA special force was embodied with this object--the Florentines, or\r\n\"White Camisards\"--distinguished by the white cross which they wore in\r\nfront of their hats. They were for the most part composed of\r\ndesperadoes and miscreants, and went about pillaging and burning, with\r\nso little discrimination between friend and foe, that the Catholics\r\nthemselves implored the marshal to suppress them. These Florentines\r\nwere the perpetrators of such barbarities that Roland determined to\r\nraise a body of cavalry to hunt them down; and with that object,\r\nCatinat, the old dragoon, went down to the Camargues--a sort of\r\nisland-prairies lying between the mouths of the Rhône--where the Arabs\r\nhad left a hardy breed of horses; and there he purchased some two\r\nhundred steeds wherewith to mount the Camisard horse, to the command\r\nof which Catinat was himself appointed.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to particularise the variety of combats, of\r\nmarchings and countermarchings, which occurred during the progress of\r\nthe insurrection. Between the contending parties, the country was\r\nreduced to a desert. Tillage ceased, for there was no certainty of the\r\ncultivator reaping the crop; more likely it would be carried off or\r\nburnt by the conflicting armies. Beggars and vagabonds wandered about\r\nrobbing and plundering without regard to party or religion; and social\r\nsecurity was entirely at an end.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Montrevel still called for more troops. Of the twenty\r\nbattalions already entrusted to him, more than one-third had perished;\r\nand still the insurrection was not suppressed. He hoped, however, that\r\nthe work was now accomplished; and, looking to the wasted condition of\r\nthe country, that the famine and cold of the winter of 1703-4 would\r\ncomplete the destruction of such of the rebels as still survived.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter, however, the Camisard chiefs had not only been able\r\nto keep their forces together, but to lay up a considerable store of\r\nprovisions and ammunition, principally by captures from the enemy; and\r\nin the following spring they were in a position to take the field in\r\neven greater force than ever. They, indeed, opened the campaign by\r\ngaining two important victories over the Royalists; but though they\r\nwere their greatest, they were also nearly their last.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Martinargues was the Cannæ of the Camisards. It was\r\nfought near the village of that name, not far from Ners, early in the\r\nspring of 1704. The campaign had been opened by the Florentines, who,\r\nnow that they had made a desert of the Upper Cevennes, were burning\r\nand ravaging the Protestant villages of the plain. Cavalier had put\r\nhimself on their track, and pursued and punished them so severely,\r\nthat in their distress they called upon Montrevel to help them,\r\ninforming him of the whereabouts of the Camisards.\r\n\r\nA strong royalist force of horse and foot was immediately sent in\r\npursuit, under the command of Brigadier Lajonquière. He first marched\r\nupon the Protestant village of Lascours, where Cavalier had passed the\r\nprevious night. The brigadier severely punished the inhabitants for\r\nsheltering the Camisards, putting to death four persons, two of them\r\ngirls, whom he suspected to be Cavalier's prophetesses. On the people\r\nrefusing to indicate the direction in which the Camisards had gone, he\r\ngave the village up to plunder, and the soldiers passed several hours\r\nransacking the place, in the course of which they broke open and\r\npillaged the wine-cellars.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Cavalier and his men had proceeded in a northerly\r\ndirection, along the right bank of the little river Droude, one of the\r\naffluents of the Gardon. A messenger from Lascours overtook him,\r\ntelling him of the outrages committed on the inhabitants of the\r\nvillage; and shortly after, the inhabitants of Lascours themselves\r\ncame up--men, women, and children, who had been driven from their\r\npillaged homes by the royalist soldiery. Cavalier was enraged at the\r\nrecital of their woes; and though his force was not one-sixth the\r\nstrength of the enemy, he determined to meet their advance and give\r\nthem battle.\r\n\r\nPlacing the poor people of Lascours in safety, the Camisard leader\r\ntook up his position on a rising ground at the head of a little valley\r\nclose to the village of Martinargues. Cavalier himself occupied the\r\ncentre, his front being covered by a brook running in the hollow of a\r\nravine. Ravanel and Catinat, with a small body of men, were posted\r\nalong the two sides of the valley, screened by brushwood. The\r\napproaching Royalists, seeing before them only the feeble force of\r\nCavalier, looked upon his capture as certain.\r\n\r\n\"See!\" cried Lajonquière, \"at last we have hold of the Barbets we have\r\nbeen so long looking for!\" With his dragoons in the centre, flanked by\r\nthe grenadiers and foot, the Royalists advanced with confidence to the\r\ncharge. At the first volley, the Camisards prostrated themselves, and\r\nthe bullets went over their heads. Thinking they had fallen before his\r\nfusillade, the commander ordered his men to cross the ravine and fall\r\nupon the remnant with the bayonet. Instantly, however, Cavalier's men\r\nstarted to their feet, and smote the assailants with a deadly volley,\r\nbringing down men and horses. At the same moment, the two wings, until\r\nthen concealed, fired down upon the Royalists and completed their\r\nconfusion. The Camisards, then raising their battle-psalm, rushed\r\nforward and charged the enemy. The grenadiers resisted stoutly, but\r\nafter a few minutes the entire body--dragoons, grenadiers, marines,\r\nand Irish--fled down the valley towards the Gardon, and the greater\r\nnumber of those who were not killed were drowned, Lajonquière himself\r\nescaping with difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn this battle perished a colonel, a major, thirty-three captains and\r\nlieutenants, and four hundred and fifty men, while Cavalier's loss was\r\nonly about twenty killed and wounded. A great booty was picked up on\r\nthe field, of gold, silver, jewels, ornamented swords, magnificent\r\nuniforms, scarfs, and clothing, besides horses, as well as the plunder\r\nbrought from Lascours.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Lascours wine-cellars proved the ruin of the\r\nRoyalists, for many of the men were so drunk that they were unable\r\neither to fight or fly. After returning thanks to God on the\r\nbattle-field, Cavalier conducted the rejoicing people of Lascours back\r\nto their village, and proceeded to his head-quarters at Bouquet with\r\nhis booty and his trophies.\r\n\r\nAnother encounter shortly followed at the Bridge of Salindres, about\r\nmidway between Auduze and St. Jean du Gard, in which Roland inflicted\r\nan equally decisive defeat on a force commanded by Brigadier Lalande.\r\nInformed of the approach of the Royalists, Roland posted his little\r\narmy in the narrow, precipitous, and rocky valley, along the bottom of\r\nwhich runs the river Gardon. Dividing his men into three bodies, he\r\nposted one on the bridge, another in ambuscade at the entrance to the\r\ndefile, and a third on the summit of the precipice overhanging the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nThe Royalists had scarcely advanced to the attack of the bridge, when\r\nthe concealed Camisards rushed out and assailed their rear, while\r\nthose stationed above hurled down rocks and stones, which threw them\r\ninto complete disorder. They at once broke and fled, rushing down to\r\nthe river, into which they threw themselves; and but for Roland's\r\nneglect in guarding the steep footpath leading to the ford at the\r\nmill, the whole body would have been destroyed. As it was, they\r\nsuffered heavy loss, the general himself escaping with difficulty,\r\nleaving his white-plumed hat behind him in the hands of the Camisards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nEND OF THE CAMISARD INSURRECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe insurrection in the Cevennes had continued for more than two\r\nyears, when at length it began to excite serious uneasiness at\r\nVersailles. It was felt to be a source of weakness as well as danger\r\nto France, then at war with Portugal, England, and Savoy. What\r\nincreased the alarm of the French Government was the fact that the\r\ninsurgents were anxiously looking abroad for help, and endeavouring to\r\nexcite the Protestant governments of the North to strike a blow in\r\ntheir behalf.\r\n\r\nEngland and Holland had been especially appealed to. Large numbers of\r\nHuguenot soldiers were then serving in the English army; and it was\r\nsuggested that if they could effect a landing on the coast of\r\nLanguedoc, and co-operate with the Camisards, it would at the same\r\ntime help the cause of religious liberty, and operate as a powerful\r\ndiversion in favour of the confederate armies, then engaged with the\r\narmies of France in the Low Countries and on the Rhine.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain the feasibility of the proposed landing, and the\r\ncondition of the Camisard insurgents, the ministry of Queen Anne sent\r\nthe Marquis de Miremont, a Huguenot refugee in England, on a mission\r\nto the Cevennes; and he succeeded in reaching the insurgent camp at\r\nSt. Felix, where he met Roland and the other leaders, and arranged\r\nwith them for the descent of a body of Huguenot soldiers on the coast.\r\n\r\nIn the month of September, 1703, the English fleet was descried in the\r\nGulf of Lyons, off Aiguesmortes, making signals, which, however, were\r\nnot answered. Marshal Montrevel had been warned of the intended\r\ninvasion; and, summoning troops from all quarters, he so effectually\r\nguarded the coast, that a landing was found impracticable. Though\r\nCavalier was near at hand, he was unable at any point to communicate\r\nwith the English ships; and after lying off for a few days, they\r\nspread their sails, and the disheartened Camisards saw their intended\r\nliberators disappear in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe ministers of Louis XIV. were greatly alarmed by this event. The\r\ninvasion had been frustrated for the time, but the English fleet might\r\nreturn, and eventually succeed in effecting a landing. The danger,\r\ntherefore, had to be provided against, and at once. It became clear,\r\neven to Louis XIV. himself, that the system of terror and coercion\r\nwhich had heretofore been exclusively employed against the insurgents,\r\nhad proved a total failure. It was accordingly determined to employ\r\nsome other means, if possible, of bringing this dangerous insurrection\r\nto an end. In pursuance of this object, Montrevel, to his intense\r\nmortification, was recalled, and the celebrated Marshal Villars, the\r\nvictor of Hochstadt and Friedlingen, was appointed in his stead, with\r\nfull powers to undertake and carry out the pacification of Languedoc.\r\n\r\nVillars reached Nismes towards the end of August, 1704; but before his\r\narrival, Montrevel at last succeeded in settling accounts with\r\nCavalier, and wiped out many old scores by inflicting upon him the\r\nseverest defeat the Camisard arms had yet received. It was his first\r\nvictory over Cavalier, and his last.\r\n\r\nCavalier's recent successes had made him careless. Having so often\r\novercome the royal troops against great odds, he began to think\r\nhimself invincible, and to despise his enemy. His success at\r\nMartinargues had the effect of greatly increasing his troops; and he\r\nmade a descent upon the low country in the spring of 1704, at the head\r\nof about a thousand foot and two hundred horse.\r\n\r\nAppearing before Bouciran, which he entered without resistance, he\r\ndemolished the fortifications, and proceeded southwards to St. Géniès,\r\nwhich he attacked and took, carrying away horses, mules, and arms.\r\nNext day he marched still southward to Caveirac, only about three\r\nmiles east of Nismes.\r\n\r\nMontrevel designedly published his intention of taking leave of his\r\ngovernment on a certain day, and proceeding to Montpellier with only a\r\nvery slender force--pretending to send the remainder to Beaucaire, in\r\nthe opposite direction, for the purpose of escorting Villars, his\r\nsuccessor, into the city. His object in doing this was to deceive the\r\nCamisard leader, and to draw him into a trap.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence became known to Cavalier, who now watched the\r\nMontpellier road, for the purpose of inflicting a parting blow upon\r\nhis often-baffled enemy. Instead, however, of Montrevel setting out\r\nfor Montpellier with a small force, he mustered almost the entire\r\ntroops belonging to the garrison of Nismes--over six thousand horse\r\nand foot--and determined to overwhelm Cavalier, who lay in his way.\r\nMontrevel divided his force into several bodies, and so disposed them\r\nas completely to surround the comparatively small Camisard force,\r\nnear Langlade. The first encounter was with the royalist regiment of\r\nFirmarcon, which Cavalier completely routed; but while pursuing them\r\ntoo keenly, the Camisards were assailed in flank by a strong body of\r\nfoot posted in vineyards along the road, and driven back upon the main\r\nbody. The Camisards now discovered that a still stronger battalion was\r\nstationed in their rear; and, indeed, wherever they turned, they saw\r\nthe Royalists posted in force. There was no alternative but cutting\r\ntheir way through the enemy; and Cavalier, putting himself at the head\r\nof his men, led the way, sword in hand.\r\n\r\nA terrible struggle ensued, and the Camisards at last reached the\r\nbridge at Rosni; but there, too, the Royalists were found blocking the\r\nroad, and crowding the heights on either side. Cavalier, to avoid\r\nrecognition, threw off his uniform, and assumed the guise of a simple\r\nCamisard. Again he sought to force his way through the masses of the\r\nenemy. His advance was a series of hand-to-hand fights, extending over\r\nsome six miles, and the struggle lasted for nearly the entire day.\r\nMore than a thousand dead strewed the roads, of whom one half were\r\nCamisards. The Royalists took five drums, sixty-two horses, and four\r\nmules laden with provisions, but not one prisoner.\r\n\r\nWhen Villars reached Nismes and heard of this battle, he went to see\r\nthe field, and expressed his admiration at the skill and valour of the\r\nCamisard chief. \"Here is a man,\" said he, \"of no education, without\r\nany experience in the art of war, who has conducted himself under the\r\nmost difficult and delicate circumstances as if he had been a great\r\ngeneral. Truly, to fight such a battle were worthy of Cæsar!\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the conduct of Cavalier in this struggle so impressed Marshal\r\nVillars, that he determined, if possible, to gain him over, together\r\nwith his brave followers, to the ranks of the royal army. Villars was\r\nno bigot, but a humane and honourable man, and a thorough soldier. He\r\ndeplored the continuance of this atrocious war, and proceeded to take\r\nimmediate steps to bring it, if possible, to a satisfactory\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, the defeat of the Camisards had been\r\nfollowed by other reverses. During the absence of Cavalier in the\r\nSouth, the royalist general Lalande, at the head of five thousand\r\ntroops, fell upon the joint forces of Roland and Joany at Brenoux, and\r\ncompletely defeated them. The same general lay in wait for the return\r\nof Cavalier with his broken forces, to his retreat near Euzet; and on\r\nhis coming up, the Royalists, in overpowering numbers, fell upon the\r\ndispirited Camisards, and inflicted upon them another heavy loss.\r\n\r\nBut a greater calamity, if possible, was the discovery and capture of\r\nCavalier's magazines in the caverns near Euzet. The royalist soldiers,\r\nhaving observed an old woman frequently leaving the village for the\r\nadjoining wood with a full basket and returning with an empty one,\r\nsuspected her of succouring the rebels, arrested her, and took her\r\nbefore the general. When questioned at first she would confess\r\nnothing; on which she was ordered forthwith to be hanged. When taken\r\nto the gibbet in the market-place, however, the old woman's resolution\r\ngave way, and she entreated to be taken back to the general, when she\r\nwould confess everything. She then acknowledged that she had the care\r\nof an hospital in the adjoining wood, and that her daily errands had\r\nbeen thither. She was promised pardon if she led the soldiers at once\r\nto the place; and she did so, a battalion following at her heels.\r\n\r\nAdvancing into the wood, the old woman led the soldiers to the mouth\r\nof a cavern, into which she pointed, and the men entered. The first\r\nsight that met their eyes was a number of sick and wounded Camisards\r\nlying upon couches along ledges cut in the rock. They were immediately\r\nput to death. Entering further into the cavern, the soldiers were\r\nsurprised to find in an inner vault an immense magazine of grain,\r\nflour, chestnuts, beans, barrels of wine and brandy; farther in,\r\nstores of drugs, ointment, dressings, and hospital furnishings; and\r\nfinally, an arsenal containing a large store of sabres, muskets,\r\npistols, and gunpowder, together with the materials for making it; all\r\nof which the Royalists seized and carried off.\r\n\r\nLalande, before leaving Euzet, inflicted upon it a terrible\r\npunishment. He gave it up to pillage, then burnt it to the ground, and\r\nput the inhabitants to the sword--all but the old woman, who was left\r\nalone amidst the corpses and ashes of the ruined village. Lalande\r\nreturned in triumph to Alais, some of his soldiers displaying on the\r\npoints of their bayonets the ears of the slain Camisards.\r\n\r\nOther reverses followed in quick succession. Salomon was attacked near\r\nPont-de-Montvert, the birthplace of the insurrection, and lost some\r\neight hundred of his men. His magazines at Magistavols were also\r\ndiscovered and ransacked, containing, amongst other stores, twenty\r\noxen and a hundred sheep.\r\n\r\nThus, in four combats, the Camisards lost nearly half their forces,\r\ntogether with a large part of their arms, ammunition, and provisions.\r\nThe country occupied by them had been ravaged and reduced to a state\r\nof desert, and there seemed but little prospect of their again being\r\nable to make head against their enemies.\r\n\r\nThe loss of life during the last year of the insurrection had been\r\nfrightful. Some twenty thousand men had perished--eight thousand\r\nsoldiers, four thousand of the Roman Catholic population, and from\r\nseven to eight thousand Protestants.\r\n\r\nVillars had no sooner entered upon the functions of his office than he\r\nset himself to remedy this dreadful state of things. He was encouraged\r\nin his wise intentions by the Baron D'Aigalliers, a Protestant\r\nnobleman of high standing and great influence, who had emigrated into\r\nEngland at the Revocation, but had since returned. This nobleman\r\nentertained the ardent desire of reconciling the King with his\r\nProtestant subjects; and he was encouraged by the French Court to\r\nendeavour to bring the rebels of the Cevennes to terms.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things Villars did, was to proceed on a journey\r\nthrough the devastated districts; and he could not fail to be\r\nhorrified at the sight of the villages in ruins, the wasted vineyards,\r\nthe untilled fields, and the deserted homesteads which met his eyes on\r\nevery side. Wherever he went, he gave it out that he was ready to\r\npardon all persons--rebels as well as their chiefs--who should lay\r\ndown their arms and submit to the royal clemency; but that, if they\r\ncontinued obstinate and refused to submit, he would proceed against\r\nthem to the last extremity. He even offered to put arms in the hands\r\nof such of the Protestant population as would co-operate with him in\r\nsuppressing the insurrection.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the defeated Camisards under Roland were reorganizing\r\ntheir forces, and preparing again to take the field. They were\r\nunwilling to submit themselves to the professed clemency of Villars,\r\nwithout some sufficient guarantee that their religious rights--in\r\ndefence of which they had taken up arms--would be respected. Roland\r\nwas already establishing new magazines in place of those which had\r\nbeen destroyed; he was again recruiting his brigades from the\r\nProtestant communes, and many of those who had recovered from their\r\nwounds again rallied under his standard.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, D'Aigalliers suggested to Villars that a negotiation\r\nshould be opened directly with the Camisard chiefs to induce them to\r\nlay down their arms. Roland refused to listen to any overtures; but\r\nCavalier was more accessible, and expressed himself willing to\r\nnegotiate for peace provided his religion was respected and\r\nrecognised.\r\n\r\nAnd Cavalier was right. He saw clearly that longer resistance was\r\nfutile, that it could only end in increased devastation and\r\ndestruction; and he was wise in endeavouring to secure the best\r\npossible terms under the circumstances for his suffering\r\nco-religionists. Roland, who refused all such overtures, was the more\r\nuncompromising and tenacious of purpose; but Cavalier, notwithstanding\r\nhis extreme youth, was by far the more practical and politic of the\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt also that Cavalier had begun to weary of the\r\nstruggle. He became depressed and sad, and even after a victory he\r\nwould kneel down amidst the dead and wounded, and pray to God that He\r\nwould turn the heart of the King to mercy, and help to re-establish\r\nthe ancient temples throughout the land.\r\n\r\nAn interview with Cavalier was eventually arranged by Lalande. The\r\nbrigadier invited him to a conference, guaranteeing him safe conduct,\r\nand intimating that if he refused the meeting, he would be regarded as\r\nthe enemy of peace, and held responsible before God and man for all\r\nfuture bloodshed. Cavalier replied to Lalande's invitation, accepting\r\nthe interview, indicating the place and the time of meeting.\r\n\r\nCatinat, the Camisard general of horse, was the bearer of Cavalier's\r\nletter, and he rode on to Alais to deliver it, arrayed in magnificent\r\ncostume. Lalande was at table when Catinat was shown in to him.\r\nObserving the strange uniform and fierce look of the intruder, the\r\nbrigadier asked who he was. \"Catinat!\" was the reply. \"What,\" cried\r\nLalande, \"are you the Catinat who killed so many people in Beaucaire?\"\r\n\"Yes, it is I,\" said Catinat, \"and I only endeavoured to do my duty.\"\r\n\"You are hardy, indeed, to dare to show yourself before me.\" \"I have\r\ncome,\" said the Camisard, \"in good faith, persuaded that you are an\r\nhonest man, and on the assurance of my brother Cavalier that you would\r\ndo me no harm. I come to deliver you his letter.\" And so saying, he\r\nhanded it to the brigadier. Hastily perusing the letter, Lalande said,\r\n\"Go back to Cavalier, and tell him that in two hours I shall be at the\r\nBridge of Avène with only ten officers and thirty dragoons.\"\r\n\r\nThe interview took place at the time appointed, on the bridge over the\r\nAvène, a few miles south of Alais. Cavalier arrived, attended by three\r\nhundred foot and sixty Camisard dragoons. When the two chiefs\r\nrecognised each other, they halted their escorts, dismounted, and,\r\nfollowed by some officers, proceeded on foot to meet each other.\r\n\r\nLalande had brought with him Cavalier's younger brother, who had been\r\nfor some time a prisoner, and presented him, saying, \"The King gives\r\nhim to you in token of his merciful intentions.\" The brothers, who\r\nhad not met since their mother's death, embraced and wept. Cavalier\r\nthanked the general; and then, leaving their officers, the two went on\r\none side, and conferred together alone.\r\n\r\n\"The King,\" said Lalande, \"wishes, in the exercise of his clemency, to\r\nterminate this war amongst his subjects; what are your terms and your\r\ndemands?\" \"They consist of three things,\" replied Cavalier: \"liberty\r\nof worship; the deliverance of our brethren who are in prison and at\r\nthe galleys; and, if the first condition be refused, then free\r\npermission to leave France.\" \"How many persons would wish to leave the\r\nkingdom?\" asked Lalande. \"Ten thousand of various ages and both\r\nsexes.\" \"Ten thousand! It is impossible! Leave might possibly be\r\ngranted for two, but certainly not for ten.\" \"Then,\" said Cavalier,\r\n\"if the King will not allow us to leave the kingdom, he will at least\r\nre-establish our ancient edicts and privileges?\"\r\n\r\nLalande promised to report the result of the conference to the\r\nmarshal, though he expressed a doubt whether he could agree to the\r\nterms proposed. The brigadier took leave of Cavalier by expressing the\r\ndesire to be of service to him at any time; but he made a gross and\r\nindelicate mistake in offering his purse to the Camisard chief. \"No,\r\nno!\" said Cavalier, rejecting it with a look of contempt, \"I wish for\r\nnone of your gold, but only for religious liberty, or, if that be\r\nrefused, for a safe conduct out of the kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nLalande then asked to be taken up to the Camisard troop, who had been\r\nwatching the proceedings of their leader with great interest. Coming\r\nup to them in the ranks, he said, \"Here is a purse of a hundred louis\r\nwith which to drink the King's health.\" Their reply was like their\r\nleader's, \"We want no money, but liberty of conscience.\" \"It is not\r\nin my power to grant you that,\" said the general, \"but you will do\r\nwell to submit to the King's will.\" \"We are ready,\" said they, \"to\r\nobey his orders, provided he grants our just demands; but if not, we\r\nare prepared to die arms in hand.\" And thus ended this memorable\r\ninterview, which lasted for about two hours; Lalande and his followers\r\nreturning to Alais, while Cavalier went with his troop in the\r\ndirection of Vezenobres.\r\n\r\nCavalier's enemies say that in the course of his interview with\r\nLalande he was offered honours, rewards, and promotion, if he would\r\nenter the King's service; and it is added that Cavalier was tempted by\r\nthese offers, and thereby proved false to his cause and followers. But\r\nit is more probable that Cavalier was sincere in his desire to come to\r\nfair terms with the King, observing the impossibility, under the\r\ncircumstances, of prolonging the struggle against the royal armies\r\nwith any reasonable prospect of success. If Cavalier were really\r\nbribed by any such promises of promotion, at all events such promises\r\nwere never fulfilled; nor did the French monarch reward him in any way\r\nfor his endeavours to bring the Camisard insurrection to an end.\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of Roland to hold aloof from these negotiations,\r\nand refuse to come to any terms whatever with \"Baal.\" As if to\r\nseparate himself entirely from Cavalier, he withdrew into the Upper\r\nCevennes to resume the war. At the very time that Cavalier was holding\r\nthe conference with the royalist general at the Bridge of the Avène,\r\nRoland and Joany, with a body of horse and foot, waylaid the Count de\r\nTournou at the plateau of Font-morte--the place where Seguier, the\r\nfirst Camisard leader, had been defeated and captured--and suddenly\r\nfell upon the Royalists, putting them to flight.\r\n\r\nA rich booty fell into the hands of the Camisards, part of which\r\nconsisted of the quarter's rental of the confiscated estate of Salgas,\r\nin the possession of the King's collector, Viala, whom the royalist\r\ntroops were escorting to St. Jean de Gard. The collector, who had made\r\nhimself notorious for his cruelty, was put to death after frightful\r\ntorment, and his son and nephew were also shot. So far, therefore, as\r\nRoland and his associates were concerned, there appeared to be no\r\nintention of surrender or compromise; and Villars was under the\r\nnecessity of prosecuting the war against them to the last extremity.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Cavalier was hailed throughout the low country as the\r\npacificator of Languedoc. The people on both sides had become heartily\r\nsick of the war, and were glad to be rid of it on any terms that\r\npromised peace and security for the future. At the invitation of\r\nMarshal Villars, Cavalier proceeded towards Nismes, and his march from\r\ntown to town was one continuous ovation. He was eagerly welcomed by\r\nthe population; and his men were hospitably entertained by the\r\ngarrisons of the places through which they passed. Every liberty was\r\nallowed him; and not a day passed without a religious meeting being\r\nheld, accompanied with public preaching, praying, and psalm-singing.\r\nAt length Cavalier and his little army approached the neighbourhood of\r\nNismes, where his arrival was anticipated with extraordinary interest.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful old city had witnessed many strange sights; but probably\r\nthe entry of the young Camisard chief was one of the most remarkable\r\nof all. This herd-boy and baker's apprentice of the Cevennes, after\r\nholding at bay the armies of France for nearly three years, had come\r\nto negotiate a treaty of peace with its most famous general. Leaving\r\nthe greater part of his cavalry and the whole of his infantry at St.\r\nCésaire, a few miles from Nismes, Cavalier rode towards the town\r\nattended by eighteen horsemen commanded by Catinat. On approaching the\r\nsouthern gate, he found an immense multitude waiting his arrival. \"He\r\ncould not have been more royally welcomed,\" said the priest of St.\r\nGermain, \"had he been a king.\"\r\n\r\nCavalier rode at the head of his troop gaily attired; for fine dress\r\nwas one of the weaknesses of the Camisard chiefs. He wore a\r\ntight-fitting doeskin coat ornamented with gold lace, scarlet\r\nbreeches, a muslin cravat, and a large beaver with a white plume; his\r\nlong fair hair hanging over his shoulders. Catinat rode by his side on\r\na high-mettled charger, attracting all eyes by his fine figure, his\r\nmartial air, and his magnificent costume. Cavalier's faithful friend,\r\nDaniel Billard, rode on his left; and behind followed his little\r\nbrother in military uniform, between the Baron d'Aigalliers and\r\nLacombe, the agents for peace.\r\n\r\nThe cavalcade advanced through the dense crowd, which could with\r\ndifficulty be kept back, past the Roman Amphitheatre, and along the\r\nRue St. Antoine, to the Garden of the Récollets, a Franciscan convent,\r\nnearly opposite the elegant Roman temple known as the Maison\r\nCarrée.[45] Alighting from his horse at the gate, and stationing his\r\nguard there under the charge of Catinat, Cavalier entered the garden,\r\nand was conducted to Marshal Villars, with whom was Baville, intendant\r\nof the province; Baron Sandricourt, governor of Nismes; General\r\nLalande, and other dignitaries. Cavalier looked such a mere boy, that\r\nVillars at first could scarcely believe that it was the celebrated\r\nCamisard chief who stood before him. The marshal, however, advanced\r\nseveral steps, and addressed some complimentary words to Cavalier, to\r\nwhich he respectfully replied.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 45: The Nismes Theatre now occupies part of the\r\n         Jardin des Récollets.]\r\n\r\nThe conference then began and proceeded, though not without frequent\r\ninterruptions from Baville, who had so long regarded Cavalier as a\r\ndespicable rebel, that he could scarcely brook the idea of the King's\r\nmarshal treating with him on anything like equal terms. But the\r\nmarshal checked the intendant by reminding him that he had no\r\nauthority to interfere in a matter which the King had solely entrusted\r\nto himself. Then turning to Cavalier, he asked him to state his\r\nconditions for a treaty of peace.\r\n\r\nCavalier has set forth in his memoirs the details of the conditions\r\nproposed by him, and which he alleges were afterwards duly agreed to\r\nand signed by Villars and Baville, on the 17th of May, 1704, on the\r\npart of the King. The first condition was liberty of conscience, with\r\nthe privilege of holding religious assemblies in country places. This\r\nwas agreed to, subject to the Protestant temples not being rebuilt.\r\nThe second--that all Protestants in prison or at the galleys should be\r\nset at liberty within six weeks from the date of the treaty--was also\r\nagreed to. The third--that all who had left the kingdom on account of\r\ntheir religion should have liberty to return, and be restored to their\r\nestates and privileges--was agreed to, subject to their taking the\r\noath of allegiance. The fourth--as to the re-establishment of the\r\nparliament of Languedoc on its ancient footing--was promised\r\nconsideration. The fifth and sixth--that the province should be free\r\nfrom capitation tax for ten years, and that the Protestants should\r\nhold Montpellier, Cette, Perpignan, and Aiguesmortes, as cautionary\r\ntowns--were refused. The seventh--that those inhabitants of the\r\nCevennes whose houses had been burnt during the civil war should pay\r\nno imposts for seven years--was granted. And the eighth--that Cavalier\r\nshould raise a regiment of dragoons to serve the King in Portugal--was\r\nalso granted.\r\n\r\nThese conditions are said to have been agreed to on the distinct\r\nunderstanding that the insurrection should forthwith cease, and that\r\nall persons in arms against the King should lay them down and submit\r\nthemselves to his majesty's clemency.\r\n\r\nThe terms having been generally agreed to, Cavalier respectfully took\r\nhis leave of the marshal, and returned to his comrades at the gate.\r\nBut Catinat and the Camisard guard had disappeared. The conference had\r\nlasted two hours, during which Cavalier's general of horse had become\r\ntired of waiting, and gone with his companions to refresh himself at\r\nthe sign of the Golden Cup. On his way thither, he witched the world\r\nof Nismes with his noble horsemanship, making his charger bound and\r\nprance and curvet, greatly to the delight of the immense crowd that\r\nfollowed him.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the Camisard guard to the Récollets, Cavalier mounted\r\nhis horse, and, escorted by them, proceeded to the Hôtel de la Poste,\r\nwhere he rested. In the evening, he came out on the Esplanade, and\r\nwalked freely amidst the crowd, amongst whom were many ladies, eager\r\nto see the Camisard hero, and happy if they could but hear him speak,\r\nor touch his dress. He then went to visit the mother of Daniel, his\r\nfavourite prophet, a native of Nismes, whose father and brother were\r\nboth prisoners because of their religion. Returning to the hotel,\r\nCavalier mustered his guard, and set out for Calvisson, followed by\r\nhundreds of people, singing together as they passed through the town\r\ngate the 133rd Psalm--\"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for\r\nbrethren to dwell together in unity!\"\r\n\r\nCavalier remained with his companions at Calvisson for eight days,\r\nduring which he enjoyed the most perfect freedom of action. He held\r\npublic religious services daily, at first amidst the ruins of the\r\ndemolished Protestant temple, and afterwards, when the space was\r\ninsufficient, in the open plain outside the town walls. People came\r\nfrom all quarters to attend them--from the Vaunage, from Sommières,\r\nfrom Lunel, from Nismes, and even from Montpellier. As many as forty\r\nthousand persons are said to have resorted to the services during\r\nCavalier's sojourn at Calvisson. The plains resounded with preaching\r\nand psalmody from morning until evening, sometimes until late at\r\nnight, by torchlight.\r\n\r\nThese meetings were a great cause of offence to the more bigoted of\r\nthe Roman Catholics, who saw in them the triumph of their enemies.\r\nThey muttered audibly against the policy of Villars, who was\r\ntolerating if not encouraging heretics--worthy, in their estimation,\r\nonly of perdition. Fléchier, Bishop of Nismes, was full of\r\nlamentations on the subject, and did not scruple to proclaim that war,\r\nwith all its horrors, was even more tolerable than such a peace as\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, the peace proved only of short duration, and Cavalier's\r\nanticipations of unity and brotherly love were not destined to be\r\nfulfilled. Whether Roland was jealous of the popularity achieved by\r\nCavalier, or suspected treachery on the part of the Royalists, or\r\nwhether he still believed in the ability of his followers to conquer\r\nreligious liberty and compel the re-establishment of the ancient\r\nedicts by the sword, does not clearly appear. At all events, he\r\nrefused to be committed in any way by what Cavalier had done; and when\r\nthe treaty entered into with Villars was submitted to Roland for\r\napproval, he refused to sign it. A quarrel had almost occurred between\r\nthe chiefs, and hot words passed between them. But Cavalier controlled\r\nhimself, and still hoped to persuade Roland to adopt a practicable\r\ncourse, and bring the unhappy war to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nIt was at length agreed between them that a further effort should be\r\nmade to induce Villars to grant more liberal terms, particularly with\r\nrespect to the rebuilding of the Protestant temples; and Cavalier\r\nconsented that Salomon should accompany him to an interview with the\r\nmarshal, and endeavour to obtain such a modification of the treaty as\r\nshould meet Roland's views. Accordingly, another meeting shortly after\r\ntook place in the Garden of the Récollets at Nismes, Cavalier leaving\r\nit to Salomon to be the spokesman on the occasion.\r\n\r\nBut Salomon proved as uncompromising as his chief. He stated his\r\n_ultimatum_ bluntly and firmly--re-establishment of the Edict of\r\nNantes, and complete liberty of conscience. On no other terms, he\r\nsaid, would the Camisards lay down their arms. Villars was courtly and\r\npolite as usual, but he was as firm as Salomon. He would adhere to the\r\nterms that had been agreed to, but could not comply with the\r\nconditions proposed. The discussion lasted for two hours, and at\r\nlength became stormy and threatening on the part of Salomon, on which\r\nthe marshal turned on his heel and left the apartment.\r\n\r\nCavalier's followers had not yet been informed of the conditions of\r\nthe treaty into which he had entered with Villars, but they had been\r\nled to believe that the Edict was to be re-established and liberty of\r\nworship restored. Their suspicions had already been roused by the\r\nhints thrown out by Ravanel, who was as obdurate as Roland in his\r\nrefusal to lay down his arms until the Edict had been re-established.\r\n\r\nWhile Cavalier was still at Nismes, on his second mission to Villars,\r\naccompanied by Salomon, Ravanel, who had been left in charge of the\r\ntroop at Calvisson, assembled the men, and told them he feared they\r\nwere being betrayed--that they were to be refused this free exercise\r\nof their religion in temples of their own, but were to be required to\r\nembark as King's soldiers on shipboard, perhaps to perish at sea.\r\n\"Brethren,\" said he, \"let us cling by our own native land, and live\r\nand die for the Eternal.\" The men enthusiastically applauded the stern\r\nresolve of Ravanel, and awaited with increasing impatience the return\r\nof the negotiating chief.\r\n\r\nOn Cavalier's return to his men, he found, to his dismay, that instead\r\nof being welcomed back with the usual cordiality, they were drawn up\r\nin arms under Ravanel, and received him in silence, with angry and\r\nscowling looks. He upbraided Ravanel for such a reception, on which\r\nthe storm immediately burst. \"What is the treaty, then,\" cried\r\nRavanel, \"that thou hast made with this marshal?\"\r\n\r\nCavalier, embarrassed, evaded the inquiry; but Ravanel, encouraged by\r\nhis men, proceeded to press for the information. \"Well,\" said\r\nCavalier, \"it is arranged that we shall go to serve in Portugal.\"\r\nThere was at once a violent outburst from the ranks. \"Traitor! coward!\r\nthen thou hast sold us! But we shall have no peace--no peace without\r\nour temples.\"\r\n\r\nAt sound of the loud commotion and shouting, Vincel, the King's\r\ncommissioner, who remained at Calvisson pending the negotiations, came\r\nrunning up, and the men in their rage would have torn him to pieces,\r\nbut Cavalier threw himself in their way, exclaiming, \"Back, men! Do\r\nhim no harm, kill me instead.\" His voice, his gesture, arrested the\r\nCamisards, and Vincel turned and fled for his life.\r\n\r\nRavanel then ordered the _générale_ to be beaten. The men drew up in\r\ntheir ranks, and putting himself at their head, Ravanel marched them\r\nout of Calvisson by the northern gate. Cavalier, humiliated and\r\ndowncast, followed the troop--their leader no more. He could not part\r\nwith them thus--the men he had so often led to victory, and who had\r\nfollowed him so devotedly--but hung upon their rear, hoping they would\r\nyet relent and return to him as their chief.\r\n\r\nCatinat, his general of horse, observing Cavalier following the men,\r\nturned upon him. \"Whither wouldst thou go, traitor?\" cried Catinat.\r\nWhat! Catinat, of all others, to prove unfaithful? Yet it was so!\r\nCatinat even, presented his pistol at his former chief, but he did not\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nCavalier would not yet turn back. He hung upon the skirts of the\r\ncolumn, entreating, supplicating, adjuring the men, by all their\r\nformer love for him, to turn, and follow him. But they sternly marched\r\non, scarcely even deigning to answer him. Ravanel endeavoured to drive\r\nhim back by reproaches, which at length so irritated Cavalier, that he\r\ndrew his sword, and they were about to rush at each other, when one\r\nof the prophets ran between them and prevented bloodshed.\r\n\r\nCavalier did not desist from following them for several miles, until\r\nat length, on reaching St. Estève, the men were appealed to as to whom\r\nthey would follow, and they declared themselves for Ravanel. Cavalier\r\nmade a last appeal to their allegiance, and called out, \"Let those who\r\nlove me, follow me!\" About forty of his old adherents detached\r\nthemselves from the ranks, and followed Cavalier in the direction of\r\nNismes. But the principal body remained with Ravanel, who, waving his\r\nsabre in the air, and shouting, \"Vive l'Épée de l'Éternel!\" turned his\r\nmen's faces northward and marched on to rejoin Roland in the Upper\r\nCevennes.\r\n\r\nCavalier was completely prostrated by the desertion of his followers.\r\nHe did not know where next to turn. He could not rejoin the Camisard\r\ncamp nor enter the villages of the Cevennes, and he was ashamed to\r\napproach Villars, lest he should be charged with deceiving him. But he\r\nsent a letter to the marshal, informing him of the failure of his\r\nnegotiations, the continued revolt of the Camisards, and their\r\nrejection of him as their chief. Villars, however, was gentle and\r\ngenerous; he was persuaded that Cavalier had acted loyally and in good\r\nfaith throughout, and he sent a message by the Baron d'Aigalliers,\r\nurgently inviting him to return to Nismes and arrange as to the\r\nfuture. Cavalier accordingly set out forthwith, accompanied by his\r\nbrother and the prophet Daniel, and escorted by the ten horsemen and\r\nthirty foot who still remained faithful to his person.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary further to pursue the history of Cavalier.\r\nSuffice it to say that, at the request of Marshal Villars, he\r\nproceeded to Paris, where he had an unsatisfactory interview with\r\nLouis XIV.; that fearing an intention on the part of the Roman\r\nCatholic party to make him a prisoner, he fled across the frontier\r\ninto Switzerland; that he eventually reached England, and entered the\r\nEnglish army, with the rank of Colonel; that he raised a regiment of\r\nrefugee Frenchmen, consisting principally of his Camisard followers,\r\nat the head of whom he fought most valiantly at the battle of Almanza;\r\nthat he was afterwards appointed governor of Jersey, and died a\r\nmajor-general in the British service in the year 1740, greatly\r\nrespected by all who knew him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough Cavalier failed in carrying the treaty into effect, so far as\r\nhe was concerned, his secession at this juncture proved a deathblow to\r\nthe insurrection. The remaining Camisard leaders endeavoured in vain\r\nto incite that enthusiasm amongst their followers which had so often\r\nbefore led them to victory. The men felt that they were fighting\r\nwithout hope, and as it were with halters round their necks. Many of\r\nthem began to think that Cavalier had been justified in seeking to\r\nsecure the best terms practicable; and they dropped off, by tens and\r\nfifties, to join their former leader, whose head-quarters for some\r\ntime continued to be at Vallabergue, an island in the Rhône a little\r\nabove Beaucaire.\r\n\r\nThe insurgents were also in a great measure disarmed by Marshal\r\nVillars, who continued to pursue a policy of clemency, and at the same\r\ntime of severity. He offered a free pardon to all who surrendered\r\nthemselves, but threatened death to all who continued to resist the\r\nroyal troops. In sign of his clemency, he ordered the gibbets which\r\nhad for some years stood _en permanence_ in all the villages of the\r\nCevennes, to be removed; and he went from town to town, urging all\r\nwell-disposed people, of both religions, to co-operate with him in\r\nputting an end to the dreadful civil war that had so long desolated\r\nthe province.\r\n\r\nMoved by the marshal's eloquent appeals, the principal towns along the\r\nGardon and the Vidourle appointed deputies to proceed in a body to the\r\ncamp of Roland, and induce him if possible to accept the proffered\r\namnesty. They waited upon him accordingly at his camp of St. Felix and\r\ntold him their errand. But his answer was to order them at once to\r\nleave the place on pain of death.\r\n\r\nVillars himself sent messengers to Roland--amongst others the Baron\r\nd'Aigalliers--offering to guarantee that no one should be molested on\r\naccount of his religion, provided he and his men would lay down their\r\narms; but Roland remained inflexible--nothing short of complete\r\nreligious liberty would induce him to surrender.\r\n\r\nRoland and Joany were still at the head of about a thousand men in the\r\nUpper Cevennes. Pont-de-Montvert was at the time occupied by a body of\r\nMiguelets, whom they determined if possible to destroy. Dividing their\r\narmy into three bodies, they proceeded to assail simultaneously the\r\nthree quarters of which the village is composed. But the commander of\r\nthe Miguelets, informed of Roland's intention, was prepared to receive\r\nhim. One of the Camisard wings was attacked at the same time in front\r\nand rear, thrown into confusion and defeated; and the other wings were\r\ndriven back with heavy loss.\r\n\r\nThis was Roland's last battle. About a month later--in August,\r\n1704--while a body of Camisards occupied the Château of Castelnau, not\r\nfar from Ners, the place was suddenly surrounded at night by a body of\r\nroyalist dragoons. The alarm was raised, and Roland, half-dressed,\r\nthrew himself on horseback and fled. He was pursued, overtaken, and\r\nbrought to a stand in a wood, where, setting his back to a tree he\r\ndefended himself bravely for a time against overpowering numbers, but\r\nwas at last shot through the heart by a dragoon, and the Camisard\r\nchief lay dead upon the ground.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection did not long survive the death of Roland. The other\r\nchiefs wandered about from place to place with their followers, but\r\nthey had lost heart and hope, and avoided further encounters with the\r\nroyal forces. One after another of them surrendered. Castanet and\r\nCatinat both laid down their arms, and were allowed to leave France\r\nfor Switzerland, accompanied by twenty-two of their men. Joany also\r\nsurrendered with forty-six of his followers.\r\n\r\nOne by one the other chiefs laid down their arms--all excepting\r\nAbraham and Ravanel, who preferred liberty and misery at home to peace\r\nand exile abroad. They continued for some time to wander about in the\r\nUpper Cevennes, hiding in the woods by day and sleeping in caves by\r\nnight--hunted, deserted, and miserable. And thus at last was Languedoc\r\npacified; and at the beginning of January, 1705, Marshal Villars\r\nreturned to Versailles to receive the congratulations and honours of\r\nthe King.\r\n\r\nSeveral futile attempts were afterwards made by the banished leaders\r\nto rekindle the insurrection from its embers, Catinat and Castanet,\r\nwearied of their inaction at Geneva, stole back across the frontier\r\nand rejoined Ravanel in the Cevennes; but their rashness cost them\r\ntheir lives. They were all captured and condemned to death. Castanet\r\nand Salomon were broken alive on the wheel on the Peyrou at\r\nMontpellier, and Catinat, Ravanel, with several others, were burnt\r\nalive on the Place de la Beaucaire at Nismes.\r\n\r\nThe last to perish were Abraham and Joany. The one was shot while\r\nholding the royal troops at bay, firing upon them from the roof of a\r\ncottage at Mas-de-Couteau; the other was captured in the mountains\r\nnear the source of the Tarn. He was on his way to prison, tied behind\r\na trooper, like Rob Roy in Scott's novel, when, suddenly freeing\r\nhimself from his bonds while crossing the bridge of Pont-de-Montvert,\r\nhe slid from the horse, and leapt over the parapet into the Tarn. The\r\nsoldiers at once opened fire upon the fugitive, and he fell, pierced\r\nwith many balls, and was carried away in the torrent. And thus\r\nPont-de-Montvert, which had seen the beginning, also saw the end of\r\nthe insurrection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nGALLEY-SLAVES FOR THE FAITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the last of the Camisard leaders, there was no\r\nfurther effort at revolt. The Huguenots seemed to be entirely put\r\ndown, and Protestantism completely destroyed. There was no longer any\r\nresistance nor protest. If there were any Huguenots who had not become\r\nCatholics, they remained mute. Force had at last succeeded in stifling\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA profound quiet reigned for a time throughout France. The country had\r\nbecome a circle, closely watched by armed men--by dragoons, infantry,\r\narchers, and coastguards--beyond which the Huguenots could not escape\r\nwithout running the risk of the prison, the galley, or the gibbet.\r\n\r\nThe intendants throughout the kingdom flattered Louis XIV., and Louis\r\nXIV. flattered himself, that the Huguenots had either been converted,\r\nextirpated, or expelled the kingdom. The King had medals struck,\r\nannouncing the \"_extinction of heresy_.\" A proclamation to this effect\r\nwas also published by the King, dated the 8th of March, 1715,\r\ndeclaring the entire conversion of the French Huguenots, and\r\nsentencing those who, after that date, relapsed from Catholicism to\r\nProtestantism, to all the penalties of heresy.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, had become of the Huguenots? They were for the moment\r\nprostrate, but their life had not gone out of them. Many were no doubt\r\n\"converted.\" They had not strength to resist the pains and penalties\r\nthreatened by the State if they refused. They accordingly attended\r\nMass, and assisted in ceremonies which at heart they detested. Though\r\nthey blushed at their apostasy, they were too much broken down and\r\nweary of oppression and suffering to attempt to be free.\r\n\r\nBut though many Huguenots pretended to be \"converted,\" the greater\r\nnumber silently refrained. They held their peace and bided their time.\r\nMeanwhile, however, they were subject to all the annoyances of\r\npersecution. Persecution had seized them from the day of their birth,\r\nand never relaxed its hold until the day of their death. Every\r\nnew-born child must be taken to the priest to be baptized. When the\r\nchildren had grown into boys and girls, they must go to school and be\r\neducated, also by the priest. If their parents refused to send them,\r\nthe children were forcibly seized, taken away, and brought up in the\r\nJesuit schools and nunneries. And lastly, when grown up into young men\r\nand women, they must be married by the priest, or their offspring be\r\ndeclared illegitimate.\r\n\r\nThe Huguenots refused to conform to all this. Nevertheless, it was by\r\nno means easy to continue to refuse obeying the priest. The priest was\r\nwell served with spies, though the principal spy in every parish was\r\nhimself. There were also numerous other professional spies--besides\r\nidlers, mischief-makers, and \"good-natured friends.\" In time of peace,\r\nalso, soldiers were usually employed in performing the disgraceful\r\nduty of acting as spies upon the Huguenots.\r\n\r\nThe Huguenot was ordered to attend Mass under the penalty of fine and\r\nimprisonment. Supposing he refused, because he did not believe that\r\nthe priest had the miraculous power of converting bread and wine into\r\nsomething the very opposite. The priest insisted that he did possess\r\nthis power, and that he was supported by the State in demanding that\r\nthe Huguenot _must_ come and worship his transubstantiation of bread\r\ninto flesh and wine into blood. \"I do not believe it,\" said the\r\nHuguenot. \"But I _order_ you to come, for Louis XIV. has proclaimed\r\nyou to be a converted Catholic, and if you refuse you will be at once\r\nsubject to all the penalties of heresy.\" It was certainly very\r\ndifficult to argue with a priest who had the hangman at his back, or\r\nwith the King who had his hundred thousand dragoons. And so, perhaps,\r\nthe threatened Huguenot went to Mass, and pretended to believe all\r\nthat the priest had said about his miraculous powers.\r\n\r\nBut many resolutely continued to refuse, willing to incur the last and\r\nheaviest penalties. Then it came to be seen that Protestantism,\r\nalthough, declared defunct by the King's edict, had not in fact expired,\r\nbut was merely reposing for a time in order to make a fresh start\r\nforward. The Huguenots who still remained in France, whether as \"new\r\nconverts\" or as \"obstinate heretics,\" at length began to emerge from\r\ntheir obscurity. They met together in caves and solitary places--in deep\r\nand rocky gorges--in valleys among the mountains--where they prayed\r\ntogether, sang together their songs of David, and took counsel one with\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nAt length, from private meetings for prayer, religious assemblies\r\nbegan to be held in the Desert, and preachers made their appearance.\r\nThe spies spread about the country informed the intendants. The\r\nmeetings were often surprised by the military. Sometimes the soldiers\r\nwould come upon them suddenly, and fire into the crowd of men, women,\r\nand children. On some occasions a hundred persons or more would be\r\nkilled upon the spot. Of those taken prisoners, the preachers were\r\nhanged or broken on the wheel, the women were sent to prison, and the\r\nchildren, to nunneries, while the men were sent to be galley-slaves\r\nfor life.[46]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 46: In the Viverais and elsewhere they sang the\r\n         song of the persecuted Church:--\r\n\r\n                \"Nos filles dans les monastères,\r\n                 Nos prisonniers dans les cachots.\r\n             Nos martyrs dont le sang se répand à grands flots,\r\n                 Nos confesseurs sur les galères,\r\n                 Nos malades persécutés,\r\n             Nos mourants exposés à plus d'une furie,\r\n                 Nos morts traînés à la voierie,\r\n                 Te disent (ô Dieu!) nos calamités.\"]\r\n\r\nThe persecutions to which Huguenot women and children were exposed\r\ncaused a sudden enlargement of all the prisons and nunneries in\r\nFrance. Many of the old castles were fitted up as gaols, and even\r\ntheir dungeons were used for the incorrigible heretics. One of the\r\nworst of these was the Tour de Constance in the town of Aiguesmortes,\r\nwhich is to this day remembered with horror as the principal dungeon\r\nof the Huguenot women.\r\n\r\nThe town of Aiguesmortes is situated in the department of Gard, close\r\nto the Mediterranean, whose waters wash into the salt marshes and\r\nlagunes by which it is surrounded. It was erected in the thirteenth\r\ncentury for Philip the Bold, and is still interesting as an example of\r\nthe ancient feudal fortress. The fosse has since been filled up, on\r\naccount of the malaria produced by the stagnant water which it\r\ncontained.\r\n\r\nThe place is approached by a long causeway raised above the marsh, and\r\nthe entrance to the tower is spanned by an ancient gatehouse. In\r\nadvance of the tower, to the north, in an angle of the wall, is a\r\nsingle, large round tower, which served as a citadel. It is sixty-six\r\nfeet in diameter and ninety feet high, surmounted by a lighthouse\r\nturret of thirty-four feet. It consists of two large vaulted\r\napartments, the staircase from the one to the other being built within\r\nthe wall itself, which is about eighteen feet thick. The upper chamber\r\nis dimly lighted by narrow chinks through the walls. The lowest of the\r\napartments is the dungeon, which is almost without light and air. In\r\nthe centre of the floor is a hole connected with a reservoir of water\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThis Tour de Constance continued to be the principal prison for\r\nHuguenot women in France for a period of about a hundred years. It was\r\nalways horribly unhealthy; and to be condemned to this dungeon was\r\nconsidered almost as certain though a slower death than to be\r\ncondemned to the gallows. Sixteen Huguenot women confined there in\r\n1686 died within five months. Most of them were the wives of merchants\r\nof Nismes, or of men of property in the district. When the prisoners\r\ndied off, the dungeon was at once filled up again with more victims,\r\nand it was rarely, if ever, empty, down to a period within only a few\r\nyears before the outbreak of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe punishment of the men found attending religious meetings, and\r\ntaken prisoners by the soldiers, was to be sentenced to the galleys,\r\nmostly for life. They were usually collected in large numbers, and\r\nsent to the seaports attached together by chains. They were sent\r\nopenly, sometimes through the entire length of the kingdom, by way of\r\na show. The object was to teach the horrible delinquency of professing\r\nProtestantism; for it could not be to show the greater beautifulness\r\nand mercifulness of Catholicism.\r\n\r\nThe punishment of the Chain varied in degree. Sometimes it was more\r\ncruel than at other times. This depended upon the drivers of the\r\nprisoners. Marteilhe describes the punishment during his conveyance\r\nfrom Havre to Marseilles in the winter of 1712.[47] The Chain to which\r\nhe belonged did not reach Marseilles until the 17th January, 1713. The\r\nseason was bitterly cold; but that made no difference in the treatment\r\nof Huguenot prisoners.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 47: \"Autobiography of a French Protestant condemned\r\n         to the Galleys because of his Religion.\" Rotterdam, 1757.\r\n         (Since reprinted by the Religious Tract Society.)]\r\n\r\nThe Chain consisted of a file of prisoners, chained one to another in\r\nvarious ways. On this occasion, each pair was fastened by the neck\r\nwith a thick chain three feet long, in the middle of which was a round\r\nring. After being thus chained, the pairs were placed in file, couple\r\nbehind couple, when another long thick chain was passed through the\r\nrings, thus running along the centre of the gang, and the whole were\r\nthus doubly-chained together. There were no less than four hundred\r\nprisoners in the chain described by Marteilhe. The number had,\r\nhowever, greatly fallen off through deaths by barbarous treatment\r\nbefore it reached Marseilles.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be added, that the whole gang did not consist of\r\nHuguenots, but only a part of it--the Huguenots being distinguished by\r\ntheir red jackets. The rest consisted of murderers, thieves,\r\ndeserters, and criminals of various sorts.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty which the prisoners had in marching along the roads was\r\nvery great; the weight of chain which each member had to carry being\r\nno less than one hundred and fifty pounds. The lodging they had at\r\nnight was of the worst description. While at Paris, the galley-slaves\r\nwere quartered in the Château de la Tournelle, which was under the\r\nspiritual direction of the Jesuits. The gaol consisted of a large\r\ncellar or dungeon, fitted with huge beams of oak fixed close to the\r\nfloor. Thick iron collars were attached by iron chains to the beams.\r\nThe collar being placed round the prisoner's neck, it was closed and\r\nriveted upon an anvil with heavy blows of a hammer.\r\n\r\nTwenty men in pairs were thus chained to each beam. The dungeon was so\r\nlarge that five hundred men could thus be fastened up. They could not\r\nsleep lying at full length, nor could they sleep sitting or standing\r\nup straight; the beam to which they were chained being too high in the\r\none case and too low in the other. The torture which they endured,\r\ntherefore, is scarcely to be described. The prisoners were kept there\r\nuntil a sufficient number could be collected to set out in a great\r\nchain for Marseilles.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the first stage out of Paris, at Charenton, after\r\na heavy day's fatigue, their lodging was no better than before. A\r\nstable was found in which they were chained up in such a way that they\r\ncould with difficulty sit down, and then only on a dung-heap. After\r\nthey had lain there for a few hours, the prisoners' chains were taken\r\noff, and they were turned out into the spacious courtyard of the inn,\r\nwhere they were ordered to strip off their clothes, put them down at\r\ntheir feet, and march over to the other side of the courtyard.\r\n\r\nThe object of this proceeding was to search the pockets of the\r\nprisoners, examine their clothes, and find whether they contained any\r\nknives, files, or other tools which might be used for cutting the\r\nchains. All money and other valuables or necessaries that the clothes\r\ncontained were at the same time taken away.\r\n\r\nThe night was cold and frosty, with a keen north wind blowing; and\r\nafter the prisoners had been exposed to it for about half an hour,\r\ntheir bodies became so benumbed that they could scarcely move across\r\nthe yard to where their clothes were lying. Next morning it was found\r\nthat eighteen of the unfortunates were happily released by death.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to describe the tortures endured by the\r\ngalley-slaves to the end of their journey. One little circumstance\r\nmay, however, be mentioned. While marching towards the coast, the\r\nexhausted Huguenots, weary and worn out by the heaviness of their\r\nchains, were accustomed to stretch out their little wooden cups for a\r\ndrop of water to the inhabitants of the villages through which they\r\npassed. The women, whom they mostly addressed, answered their\r\nentreaties with the bitterest spite. \"Away, away!\" they cried; \"you\r\nare going where you will have _water enough_!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the gang or chain reached the port at which the prisoners were to\r\nbe confined, they were drafted on board the different galleys. These\r\nwere for the most part stationed at Toulon, but there were also other\r\ngalleys in which Huguenots were imprisoned--at Marseilles, Dunkirk,\r\nBrest, St. Malo, and Bordeaux. Let us briefly describe the galley of\r\nthose days.\r\n\r\nThe royal galley was about a hundred and fifty feet long and forty feet\r\nbroad, and was capable of containing about five hundred men. It had\r\nfifty benches for rowers, twenty-five on each side. Between these two\r\nrows of benches was the raised middle gallery, commonly called the waist\r\nof the ship, four feet high and about three or four feet broad. The oars\r\nwere fifty feet long, of which thirty-seven feet were outside the ship\r\nand thirteen within. Six men worked at each oar, all chained to the same\r\nbench. They had to row in unison, otherwise they would be heavily struck\r\nby the return rowers both before and behind them. They were under the\r\nconstant command of the _comite_ or galley-slave-driver, who struck all\r\nabout him with his long whip in urging them to work. To enable his\r\nstrokes to _tell_, the men sat naked while they rowed.[48] Their dress\r\nwas always insufficient, summer and winter--the lower part of their\r\nbodies being covered with a short red jacket and a sort of apron, for\r\ntheir manacles prevented them wearing any other dress.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 48: Le comite ou chef de chiourme, aidé de deux\r\n         _sous-comites_, allait et venait sans cesse sur le coursier,\r\n         frappant les forçats à coup de nerfs de boeuf, comme un\r\n         cocher ses chevaux. Pour rendre les coups plus sensible et\r\n         pour économiser les vêtements, _les galériens étaient nus_\r\n         quand ils ramaient.--ATHANASE COQUEREL FILS. _Les Forçats\r\n         pour la Foi_, 64.]\r\n\r\nThe chain which bound each rower to his bench was fastened to his leg,\r\nand was of such a length as to enable his feet to come and go whilst\r\nrowing. At night, the galley-slave slept where he sat--on the bench on\r\nwhich he had been rowing all day. There was no room for him to lie\r\ndown. He never quitted his bench except for the hospital or the grave;\r\nyet some of the Huguenot rowers contrived to live upon their benches\r\nfor thirty or forty years!\r\n\r\nDuring all these years they toiled in their chains in a hell of foul\r\nand disgusting utterance, for they were mixed up with thieves and the\r\nworst of criminals. They ate the bread and drank the waters of\r\nbitterness. They seemed to be forsaken by the world. They had no one\r\nto love them, for most had left their families behind them at home, or\r\nperhaps in convents or prisons. They lived under the constant threats\r\nof their keepers, who lashed them to make them row harder, who lashed\r\nthem to make them sit up, or lashed them to make them lie down. The\r\nChevalier Langeron, captain of _La Palme_, of which Marteilhe was at\r\nfirst a rower, used to call the _comite_ to him and say, \"Go and\r\nrefresh the backs of these Huguenots with a salad of strokes of the\r\nwhip.\" For the captain, it seems, \"held the most Jesuitical\r\nsentiments,\" and hated his Huguenot prisoners far worse than his\r\nthieves or his murderers.[49]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 49: \"The Autobiography of a French Protestant,\"\r\n         68.]\r\n\r\nAnd yet, at any moment, a word spoken would have made these Huguenots\r\nfree. The Catholic priests frequently visited the galleys and\r\nentreated them to become converted. If \"converted,\" and the Huguenots\r\nwould only declare that they believed in the miraculous powers of the\r\nclergy, their chains would fall away from their limbs at once; and\r\nthey would have been restored to the world, to their families, and to\r\nliberty! And who would not have declared themselves \"converted,\"\r\nrather than endure these horrible punishments? Yet by far the greater\r\nnumber of the Huguenots did not. They could not be hypocrites. They\r\nwould not lie to God. Rather than do this, they had the heroism--some\r\nwill call it the obstinacy--to remain galley-slaves for life!\r\n\r\nMany of the galley-slaves did not survive their torture long. Men of\r\nall ages and conditions, accustomed to indoor life, could not bear the\r\nexposure to the sun, rain, and snow, which the punishment of the\r\ngalley-slave involved. The old men and the young soon succumbed and\r\ndied. Middle-aged men survived the longest. But there was always a\r\nchange going on. When the numbers of a galley became thinned by death,\r\nthere were other Huguenots ready to be sent on board--perhaps waiting\r\nin some inland prison until another \"Great Chain\" could be made up for\r\nthe seaports, to go on board the galley-ships, to be manacled,\r\ntortured, and killed off as before.\r\n\r\nSuch was the treatment of the galley-slaves in time of peace. But the\r\ngalleys were also war-ships. They carried large numbers of armed men\r\non board. Sometimes they scoured the Mediterranean, and protected\r\nFrench merchant-ships against the Sallee rovers. At other times they\r\nwere engaged in the English channel, attacking Dutch and English\r\nships, sometimes picking up a prize, at other times in actual\r\nsea-fight.\r\n\r\nWhen the service required, they were compelled to row incessantly\r\nnight and day, without rest, save in the last extremity; and they were\r\ntreated as if, on the first opportunity, in sight of the enemy, they\r\nwould revolt and betray the ship; hence they were constantly watched\r\nby the soldiers on board, and if any commotion appeared amongst them,\r\nthey were shot down without ceremony, and their bodies thrown into the\r\nsea. Loaded cannons were also placed at the end of the benches of\r\nrowers, so as to shoot them down in case of necessity.\r\n\r\nWhenever an enemy's ship came up, the galley-slaves were covered over\r\nwith a linen screen, so as to prevent them giving signals to the\r\nenemy. When an action occurred, they were particularly exposed to\r\ndanger, for the rowers and their oars were the first to be shot\r\nat--just as the boiler or screw of a war-steamer would be shot at\r\nnow--in order to disable the ship. The galley-slaves thus suffered\r\nmuch more from the enemy's shot than the other armed men of the ship.\r\nThe rowers benches were often filled with dead, before the soldiers\r\nand mariners on board had been touched.\r\n\r\nMarteilhe, while a galley-slave on board _La Palme_, was engaged in an\r\nadventure which had nearly cost him his life. Four French galleys,\r\nafter cruising along the English coast from Dover to the Downs, got\r\nsight of a fleet of thirty-five merchant vessels on their way from the\r\nTexel to the Thames, under the protection of one small English\r\nfrigate. The commanders of the galleys, taking counsel together,\r\ndetermined to attack the frigate (which they thought themselves easily\r\nable to master), and so capture the entire English fleet.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the frigate, when he saw the galleys approach him,\r\nordered the merchantmen to crowd sail and make for the Thames, the\r\nmouth of which they had nearly reached. He then sailed down upon the\r\ngalleys, determined to sacrifice his ship if necessary for the safety\r\nof his charge. The galleys fired into him, but he returned never a\r\nshot. The captain of the galley in which Marteilhe was, said, \"Oh, he\r\nis coming to surrender!\" The frigate was so near that the French\r\nmusqueteers were already firing full upon her. All of a sudden the\r\nfrigate tacked and veered round as if about to fly from the galleys.\r\nThe Frenchmen called out that the English were cowards in thus trying\r\nto avoid the battle. If they did not surrender at once, they would\r\nsink the frigate!\r\n\r\nThe English captain took no notice. The frigate then turned her stern\r\ntowards the galley, as if to give the Frenchmen an opportunity of\r\nboarding her. The French commander ordered the galley at once to run\r\nat the enemy's stern, and the crew to board the frigate. The rush was\r\nmade; the galley-slaves, urged by blows of the whip, rowing with great\r\nforce. The galley was suddenly nearing the stern of the frigate, when\r\nby a clever stroke of the helm the ship moved to one side, and the\r\ngalley, missing it, rushed past. All the oars on that side were\r\nsuddenly broken off, and the galley was placed immediately under the\r\nbroadside of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThen began the English part of the game. The French galley was seized\r\nwith grappling irons and hooked on to the English broadside. The men\r\non board the galley were as exposed as if they had been upon a raft or\r\na bridge. The frigate's guns, which were charged with grapeshot, were\r\ndischarged full upon them, and a frightful carnage ensued. The English\r\nalso threw hand grenades, which went down amongst the rowers and\r\nkilled many. They next boarded the galley, and cut to pieces all the\r\narmed men they could lay hold of, only sparing the convicts, who could\r\nmake no attempt at defence.\r\n\r\nThe English captain then threw off the galley, which he had broadsided\r\nand disarmed, in order to look after the merchantmen, which some of\r\nthe other galleys had gone to intercept on their way to the mouth of\r\nthe Thames. Some of the ships had already been captured; but the\r\ncommanders of the galleys, seeing their fellow-commodores flying\r\nsignals of distress, let go their prey, and concentrated their attack\r\nupon the frigate. This they surrounded, and after a very hard struggle\r\nthe frigate was captured, but not until the English captain had\r\nascertained that all the fleet of which he had been in charge had\r\nentered the Thames and were safe.\r\n\r\nIn the above encounter with the English frigate Marteilhe had nearly\r\nlost his life. The bench on which he was seated, with five other\r\nslaves, was opposite one of the loaded guns of the frigate. He saw\r\nthat it must be discharged directly upon them. His fellows tried to\r\nlie down flat, while Marteilhe himself stood up. He saw the gunner\r\nwith his lighted match approach the touchhole; then he lifted up his\r\nheart to God; the next moment he was lying stunned and prostrate in\r\nthe centre of the galley, as far as the chain would allow him to\r\nreach. He was lying across the body of the lieutenant, who was killed.\r\nA long time passed, during which the fight was still going on, and\r\nthen Marteilhe came to himself, towards dark. Most of his\r\nfellow-slaves were killed. He himself was bleeding from a large open\r\nwound on his shoulder, another on his knee, and a third in his\r\nstomach. Of the eighteen men around him he was the only one that\r\nescaped, with his three wounds.\r\n\r\nThe dead were all thrown into the sea. The men were about to throw\r\nMarteilhe after them, but while attempting to release him from his\r\nchain, they touched the wound upon his knee, and he groaned heavily.\r\nThey let him remain where he lay. Shortly after, he was taken down to\r\nthe bottom of the hold with the other men, where he long lay amongst\r\nthe wounded and dying. At length he recovered from his wounds, and was\r\nagain returned to his bench, to re-enter the horrible life of a\r\ngalley-slave.\r\n\r\nThere was another mean and unmanly cruelty, connected with this\r\ngalley-slave service, which was practised only upon the Huguenots. If\r\nan assassin or other criminal received a wound in the service of the\r\nstate while engaged in battle, he was at once restored to his\r\nliberty; but if a Huguenot was wounded, he was never released. He was\r\nreturned to his bench and chained as before; the wounds he had\r\nreceived being only so many additional tortures to be borne by him in\r\nthe course of his punishment.\r\n\r\nMarteilhe, as we have already stated, was disembarked when he had\r\nsufficiently recovered, and marched through the entire length of\r\nFrance, enchained with other malefactors. On his arrival at\r\nMarseilles, he was placed on board the galley _Grand Réale_, where he\r\nremained until peace was declared between England and France by the\r\nTreaty of Utrecht.[50]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 50: \"Autobiography of a French Protestant,\"\r\n         112-21.]\r\n\r\nQueen Anne of England, at the instigation of the Marquis de Rochegade,\r\nthen made an effort to obtain the liberation of Protestants serving at\r\nthe galleys; and at length, out of seven hundred and forty-two\r\nHuguenots who were then enslaved, a hundred and thirty-six were\r\nliberated, of whom Marteilhe was one. He was thus enabled to get rid\r\nof his inhuman countrymen, and to spend the remainder of his life in\r\nHolland and England, where Protestants were free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nANTOINE COURT\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost at the very time that Louis XIV. was lying on his death-bed at\r\nVersailles, a young man conceived the idea of re-establishing\r\nProtestantism in France! Louis XIV. had tried to enter heaven by\r\nsuperstition and cruelty. On his death-bed he began to doubt whether\r\nhe \"had not carried his authority too far.\"[51] But the Jesuits tried\r\nto make death easy for him, covering his body with relics of the true\r\ncross.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 51: Saint-Simon and Dangeau.]\r\n\r\nVery different was the position of the young man who tried to undo all\r\nthat Louis XIV., under the influence of his mistress De Maintenon, and\r\nhis Jesuit confessor, Père la Chase,[52] had been trying all his life\r\nto accomplish. He was an intelligent youth, the son of Huguenot\r\nparents in Viverais, of comparatively poor and humble condition. He\r\nwas, however, full of energy, activity, and a zealous disposition for\r\nwork. Observing the tendency which Protestantism had, while bereft of\r\nits pastors, to run into gloomy forms of fanaticism, Antoine Court\r\nconceived the idea of reviving the pastorate, and restoring the\r\nproscribed Protestant Church of France. It was a bold idea, but the\r\nresult proved that Antoine Court was justified in entertaining it.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 52: Amongst the many satires and epigrams with\r\n         which Louis XIV. was pursued to the grave, the following\r\n         epitaph may be given:--\r\n\r\n           \"Ci gist le mari de Thérèse\r\n           De la Montespan le Mignon,\r\n           L'esclave de la Maintenon,\r\n           Le valet du père La Chaise.\"\r\n\r\n         At the death of Louis XIV., Voltaire, an _élève_ of the\r\n         Jesuits, was appropriately coming into notice. At the age of\r\n         about twenty he was thrown into the Bastille; for having\r\n         written a satire on Louis XIV., of which the following is an\r\n         extract:--\r\n\r\n           \"J'ai vu sous l'habit d'une femme\r\n             Un démon nous donner la loi;\r\n           Elle sacrifia son Dieu, sa foi, son âme,\r\n           Pour séduire l'esprit d'un trop crédule roi.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n             J'ai vu l'hypocrite honoré:\r\n           J'ai vu, c'est dire tout, le jésuite adoré:\r\n             J'ai vu ces maux sous le règne funeste\r\n           D'un prince que jadis la colère céleste\r\n           Accorda, par vengeance, à nos désirs ardens:\r\n             J'ai vu ces maux, et je n'ai pas vingt ans.\"\r\n\r\n         Voltaire denied having written this satire.]\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. died in August, 1715. During that very month, Court\r\nsummoned together a small number of Huguenots to consider his\r\nsuggestions. The meeting was held at daybreak, in an empty quarry near\r\nNismes, which has already been mentioned in the course of this\r\nhistory. But it may here be necessary to inform the reader of the\r\nearly life of this enthusiastic young man.\r\n\r\nAntoine Court was born at Villeneuve de Berg, in Viverais, in the year\r\n1696. Religious persecution was then at its height; assemblies were\r\nvigorously put down; and all pastors taken prisoners were hanged on\r\nthe Peyrou at Montpellier. Court was only four years old when his\r\nfather died, and his mother resolved, if the boy lived, to train him\r\nup so that he might consecrate himself to the service of God. He was\r\nstill very young while the Camisard war was in progress, but he heard\r\na great deal about it, and vividly remembered all that he heard.\r\n\r\nAntoine Court, like many Protestant children, was compelled to attend\r\na Jesuit school in his neighbourhood. Though but a boy he abhorred the\r\nMass. With Protestants the Mass was then the symbol of persecution; it\r\nwas identified with the Revocation of the Edict--the dragonnades, the\r\ngalleys, the prisons, the nunneries, the monkeries, and the Jesuits.\r\nThe Mass was not a matter of knowledge, but of fear, of terror, and of\r\nhereditary hatred.\r\n\r\nAt school, the other boys were most bitter against Court, because he\r\nwas the son of a Huguenot. Every sort of mischief was practised upon\r\nhim, for little boys are generally among the greatest of persecutors.\r\nCourt was stoned, worried, railed at, laughed at, spit at. When\r\nleaving school, the boys called after him \"He, he! the eldest son of\r\nCalvin!\" They sometimes pursued him with clamour and volleys of stones\r\nto the door of his house, collecting in their riotous procession all\r\nthe other Catholic boys of the place. Sometimes they forced him into\r\nchurch whilst the Mass was being celebrated. In fact, the boy's hatred\r\nof the Mass and of Catholicism grew daily more and more vehement.\r\n\r\nAll these persecutions, together with reading some of the books which\r\ncame under his notice at home, confirmed his aversion to the\r\nJesuitical school to which he had been sent. At the same time he\r\nbecame desirous of attending the secret assemblies, which he knew were\r\nbeing held in the neighbourhood. One day, when his mother set out to\r\nattend one of them, the boy set out to follow her. She discovered him,\r\nand demanded whither he was going. \"I follow you, mother,\" said he,\r\n\"and I wish you to permit me to go where you go. I know that you go to\r\npray to God, and will you refuse me the favour of going to do so with\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nShe shed tears at his words, told him of the danger of attending the\r\nassembly, and strongly exhorted him to secrecy; but she allowed him to\r\naccompany her. He was at that time too little and weak to walk the\r\nwhole way to the meeting; but other worshippers coming up, they took\r\nthe boy on their shoulders and carried him along with them.\r\n\r\nAt the age of seventeen, Court began to read the Bible at the\r\nassemblies. One day, in a moment of sudden excitement, common enough\r\nat secret meetings, he undertook to address the assembly. What he said\r\nwas received with much approval, and he was encouraged to go on\r\npreaching. He soon became famous among the mountaineers, and was\r\nregarded as a young man capable of accomplishing great things.\r\n\r\nAs he grew older, he at length determined to devote his life to\r\npreaching and ministering to the forsaken and afflicted Protestants.\r\nIt was a noble, self-denying work, the only earthly reward for which\r\nwas labour, difficulty, and danger. His mother was in great trouble,\r\nfor Antoine was her only remaining son. She did not, however, press\r\nhim to change his resolution. Court quoted to her the text, \"Whoever\r\nloves father and mother more than me, is not worthy of me.\" After\r\nthis, she only saw in her son a victim consecrated, like another\r\nAbraham, to the Divine service.\r\n\r\nAfter arriving at his decision, Court proceeded to visit the Huguenots\r\nin Low Languedoc, passing by Uzes to Nismes, and preaching wherever he\r\ncould draw assemblies of the people together. His success during this\r\nrapid excursion induced him to visit Dauphiny. There he met Brunel,\r\nanother preacher, with knapsack on his back, running from place to\r\nplace in order to avoid spies, priests, and soldiers. The two were\r\nequally full of ardour, and they went together preaching in many\r\nplaces, and duly encouraging each other.\r\n\r\nFrom Dauphiny, Court directed his steps to Marseilles, where the royal\r\ngalleys stationed there contained about three hundred Huguenot\r\ngalley-slaves. He penetrated these horrible floating prisons, without\r\nbeing detected, and even contrived to organize amongst them a regular\r\nsystem of secret worship. Then he returned to Nismes, and from thence\r\nwent through the Cevennes and the Viverais, preaching to people who\r\nhad never met for Protestant worship since the termination of the wars\r\nof the Camisards. To elude the spies, who began to make hot search for\r\nhim, because of the enthusiasm which he excited, Court contrived to be\r\nalways on the move, and to appear daily in some fresh locality.\r\n\r\nThe constant fatigue which he underwent undermined his health, and he\r\nwas compelled to remain for a time inactive at the mineral waters of\r\nEuzet. This retirement proved useful. He began to think over what\r\nmight be done to revivify the Protestant religion in France. Remember\r\nthat he was at that time only nineteen years of age! It might be\r\nthought presumptuous in a youth, comparatively uninstructed, even to\r\ndream of such a subject. The instruments of earthly power--King, Pope,\r\nbishops, priests, soldiers, and spies--were all arrayed against him.\r\nHe had nothing to oppose to them but truth, uprightness, conscience,\r\nand indefatigable zeal for labour.\r\n\r\nWhen Court had last met the few Protestant preachers who survived in\r\nLanguedoc, they were very undecided about taking up his scheme. They\r\nhad met at Nismes to take the sacrament in the house of a friend.\r\nThere were Bombonnoux (an old Camisard), Crotte, Corteiz, Brunel, and\r\nCourt. Without coming to any decision, they separated, some going to\r\nSwitzerland, and others to the South and West of France. It now rested\r\nwith Court, during his sickness, to study and endeavour to arrange the\r\nmethod of reorganization of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe Huguenots who remained in France were then divided into three\r\nclasses--the \"new converts,\" who professed Catholicism while hating\r\nit; the lovers of the ancient Protestant faith, who still clung to it;\r\nand, lastly, the more ignorant, who still clung to prophesying and\r\ninspiration. These last had done the Protestant Church much injury,\r\nfor the intelligent classes generally regarded them as but mere\r\nfanatics.\r\n\r\nCourt found it would be requisite to keep the latter within the\r\nleading-strings of spiritual instruction, and to encourage the \"new\r\nconverts\" to return to the church of their fathers by the\r\nre-establishment of some efficient pastoral service. He therefore\r\nurged that religious assemblies must be continued, and that discipline\r\nmust be established by the appointment of elders, presbyteries, and\r\nsynods, and also by the training up of a body of young pastors to\r\npreach amongst the people, and discipline them according to the rules\r\nof the Protestant Church. Nearly thirty years had passed since it had\r\nbeen disorganized by the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, so that\r\nsynods, presbyteries, and the training of preachers had become almost\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nThe first synod was convened by Court, and held in the abandoned\r\nquarry near Nismes, above referred to, in the very same month in which\r\nLouis XIV. breathed his last. It was a very small beginning. Two or\r\nthree laymen and a few preachers[53] were present, the whole meeting\r\nnumbering only nine persons. The place in which the meeting was held\r\nhad often before been used as a secret place of worship by the\r\nHuguenots. Religious meetings held there had often been dispersed by\r\nthe dragoons, and there was scarcely a stone in it that had not been\r\nsplashed by Huguenot blood. And now, after Protestantism had been\r\n\"finally suppressed,\" Antoine Court assembled his first synod to\r\nre-establish the proscribed religion!\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 53: Edmund Hughes says the preachers were probably\r\n         Rouviere (or Crotte), Jean Huc, Jean Vesson, Etienne Arnaud,\r\n         and Durand.]\r\n\r\nThe first meeting took place on the 21st of August, 1715, at daybreak.\r\nAfter prayer, Court, as moderator, explained his method of\r\nreorganization, which was approved. The first elders were appointed\r\nfrom amongst those present. A series of rules and regulations was\r\nresolved upon and ordered to be spread over the entire province. The\r\npreachers were then charged to go forth, to stir up the people and\r\nendeavour to bring back the \"new converts.\"\r\n\r\nThey lost no time in carrying out their mission. The first districts\r\nin which they were appointed to work were those of Mende, Alais,\r\nViviers, Uzes, Nismes, and Montpellier, in Languedoc--districts which,\r\nfifteen years before, had been the scenes of the Camisard war. There,\r\nin unknown valleys, on hillsides, on the mountains, in the midst of\r\nhostile towns and villages, the missionaries sought out the huts, the\r\nfarms, and the dwellings of the scattered, concealed, and\r\nhalf-frightened Huguenots. Amidst the open threats of the magistrates\r\nand others in office, and the fear of the still more hateful priests\r\nand spies, they went from house to house, and prayed, preached,\r\nadvised, and endeavoured to awaken the zeal of their old allies of the\r\n\"Religion.\"\r\n\r\nThe preachers were for the most part poor, and some of them were\r\nlabouring men. They were mostly natives of Languedoc. Jean Vesson, a\r\ncooper by trade, had in his youth been \"inspired,\" and prophesied in\r\nhis ecstasy. Mazelet, now an elderly man, had formerly been celebrated\r\namong the Camisards, and preached with great success before the\r\nsoldiers of Roland. At forty he was not able to read or write; but\r\nhaving been forced to fly into Switzerland, he picked up some\r\neducation at Geneva, and had studied divinity under a fellow-exile.\r\n\r\nBombonnoux had been a brigadier in the troop of Cavalier. After his\r\nchief's defection he resolved to continue the war to the end, by\r\npreaching, if not by fighting. He had been taken prisoner and\r\nimprisoned at Montpellier, in 1705. Two of his Camisard friends were\r\nfirst put upon the rack, and then, while still living, thrown upon a\r\npile and burnt to death before his eyes. But the horrible character of\r\nthe punishment did not terrify him. He contrived to escape from prison\r\nat Montpellier, and then went about convoking assemblies and preaching\r\nto the people as before.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there were Huc, Corteiz, Durand, Arnaud, Brunel, and\r\nRouviere or Crotte, who all went about from place to place, convoking\r\nassemblies and preaching. There were also some local preachers, as\r\nthey might be called--old men who could not move far from home--who\r\nworked at their looms or trades, sometimes tilling the ground by day,\r\nand preaching at night. Amongst these were Monteil, Guillot, and\r\nBonnard, all more than sixty years of age.\r\n\r\nCourt, because of his youth and energy, seems to have been among the\r\nmost active of the preachers. One day, near St. Hypolite, a chief\r\ncentre of the Huguenot population, he convoked an assembly on a\r\nmountain side, the largest that had taken place for many years. The\r\npriests of the parish gave information to the authorities; and the\r\ngovernor of Alais offered a reward of fifty pistoles to anyone who\r\nwould apprehend and deliver up to him the young preacher. Troops were\r\nsent into the district; upon which Court descended from the mountains\r\ntowards the towns of Low Languedoc, and shortly after he arrived at\r\nNismes.\r\n\r\nAt Nismes, Court first met Jacques Roger, who afterwards proved of\r\ngreat assistance to him in his work. Roger had long been an exile in\r\nWurtemburg. He was originally a native of Boissieres, in Languedoc,\r\nand when a young man was compelled to quit France with his parents,\r\nwho were Huguenots. His heart, however, continued to draw him towards\r\nhis native country, although it had treated himself and his family so\r\ncruelly.\r\n\r\nAs Roger grew older, he determined to return to France, with the\r\nobject of helping his friends of the \"Religion.\" A plan had occurred\r\nto him, like that which Antoine Court was now endeavouring to carry\r\ninto effect. The joy with which Roger encountered Court at Nismes, and\r\nlearnt his plans, may therefore be conceived. The result was, that\r\nRoger undertook to \"awaken\" the Protestants of Dauphiny, and to\r\nendeavour to accomplish there what Court was already gradually\r\neffecting in Languedoc. Roger held his first synod in Dauphiny in\r\nAugust, 1716, at which seven preachers and several elders or _anciens_\r\nassisted.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Antoine Court again set out to visit the churches\r\nwhich had been reconstructed along the banks of the Gardon. He had\r\nbeen suffering from intermittent fever, and started on his journey\r\nbefore he was sufficiently recovered. Having no horse, he walked on\r\nfoot, mostly by night, along the least known by-paths, stopping here\r\nand there upon his way. At length he became so enfeebled and ill as to\r\nbe unable to walk further. He then induced two men to carry him. By\r\ncrossing their hands over each other, they took him up between them,\r\nand carried him along on this improvised chair.\r\n\r\nCourt found a temporary lodging with a friend. But no sooner had he\r\nlaid himself down to sleep, than the alarm was raised that he must get\r\nup and fly. A spy had been observed watching the house. Court rose,\r\nput on his clothes, and though suffering great pain, started afresh.\r\nThe night was dark and rainy. By turns shivering with cold and in an\r\naccess of fever, he wandered alone for hours across the country,\r\ntowards the house of another friend, where he at last found shelter.\r\nSuch were the common experiences of these wandering, devoted,\r\nproscribed, and heroic ministers of the Gospel.\r\n\r\nTheir labours were not carried on without encountering other and\r\ngreater dangers. Now that the Protestants were becoming organized, it\r\nwas not so necessary to incite them to public worship. They even\r\nrequired to be restrained, so that they might not too suddenly awaken\r\nthe suspicion or excite the opposition of the authorities. Thus, at\r\nthe beginning of 1717, the preacher Vesson held an open assembly near\r\nAnduze. It was surprised by the troops; and seventy-two persons made\r\nprisoners, of whom the men were sent to the galleys for life, and the\r\nwomen imprisoned in the Tour de Constance. Vesson was on this occasion\r\nreprimanded by the synod, for having exposed his brethren to\r\nunnecessary danger.\r\n\r\nWhile there was the danger of loss of liberty to the people, there was\r\nthe danger of loss of life to the pastors who were bold enough to\r\nminister to their religious necessities. Etienne Arnaud having\r\npreached to an assembly near Alais, was taken prisoner by the\r\nsoldiers. They took him to Montpellier, where he was judged,\r\ncondemned, and sent back to Alais to be hanged. This brave young man\r\ngave up his life with great courage and resignation. His death caused\r\nmuch sorrow amongst the Protestants, but it had no effect in\r\ndissuading the preachers and pastors from the work they had taken in\r\nhand. There were many to take the place of Arnaud. Young Bètrine\r\noffered himself to the synod, and was accepted.\r\n\r\nScripture readers were also appointed, to read the Bible at meetings\r\nwhich preachers were not able to attend. There was, however, a great\r\nwant of Bibles amongst the Protestants. One of the first things done\r\nby the young King Louis XV.--the \"Well-beloved\" of the Jesuits--on his\r\nascending the throne, was to issue a proclamation ordering the seizure\r\nof Bibles, Testaments, Psalm-books, and other religious works used by\r\nthe Protestants. And though so many books had already been seized and\r\nburnt in the reign of Louis XIV., immense piles were again collected\r\nand given to the flames by the executioners.\r\n\r\n\"Our need of books is very great,\" wrote Court to a friend abroad; and\r\nthe same statement was repeated in many of his letters. His principal\r\nneed was of Bibles and Testaments; for every Huguenot knew the greater\r\npart of the Psalms by heart. When a Testament was obtained, it was\r\nlent about, and for the most part learnt off. The labour was divided\r\nin this way. One person, sometimes a boy or girl, of good memory,\r\nwould undertake to learn one or more chapters in the Gospels, another\r\na certain number in the Epistles, until at last a large portion of the\r\nbook was committed to memory, and could be recited at the meetings of\r\nthe assemblies. And thus also it happened, that the conversation of\r\nthe people, as well as the sermons of their preachers, gradually\r\nassumed a strongly biblical form.\r\n\r\nStrong appeals were made to foreign Protestants to supply the people\r\nwith books. The refugees who had settled in Switzerland, Holland, and\r\nEngland sent the Huguenots remaining in France considerable help in\r\nthis way. They sent many Testaments and Psalm-books, together with\r\ncatechisms for the young, and many devotional works written by French\r\ndivines residing in Holland and England--by Drelincourt, Saurin,\r\nClaude and others. These were sent safely across the frontier in\r\nbales, put into the hands of colporteurs, and circulated amongst the\r\nProtestants all over the South of France. The printing press of Geneva\r\nwas also put in requisition; and Court had many of his sermons printed\r\nthere and distributed amongst the people.\r\n\r\nUntil this time, Court had merely acted as a preacher; and it was now\r\ndetermined to ordain and consecrate him as a pastor. The ceremony,\r\nthough, comparatively unceremonious, was very touching. A large number\r\nof Protestants in the Vaunage assembled on the night of the 21st\r\nNovember, 1718, and, after prayer, Court rose and spoke for some time\r\nof the responsible duties of the ministry, and of the necessity and\r\nadvantages of preaching. He thanked God for having raised up ministers\r\nto serve the Church when so many of her enemies were seeking for her\r\nruin. He finally asked the whole assembly to pray for grace to enable\r\nhim to fulfil with renewed zeal the duties to which, he was about to\r\nbe called, together with all the virtues needed for success. At these\r\ntouching words the assembled hearers shed tears. Then Corteiz, the old\r\npastor, drew near to Court, now upon his knees, and placing a Bible\r\nupon his head, in the name of Jesus Christ, and with the authority of\r\nthe synod, gave him power to exercise all the functions of the\r\nministry. Cries of joy were heard on all sides. Then, after further\r\nprayer, the assembly broke up in the darkness of the night.\r\n\r\nThe plague which broke out in 1720 helped the progress of the new\r\nChurch. The Protestants thought the plague had been sent as a\r\npunishment for their backsliding. Piety increased, and assemblies in\r\nthe Desert were more largely attended than before. The intendants\r\nceased to interfere with them, and the soldiers were kept strictly\r\nwithin their cantonments. More preachers were licensed, and more\r\nelders were elected. Many new churches were set up throughout\r\nLanguedoc; and the department of the Lozère, in the Cevennes, became\r\nagain almost entirely Protestant. Roger and Villeveyre were almost\r\nequally successful in Dauphiny; and Saintonge, Normandy, and Poitou\r\nwere also beginning to maintain a connection with the Protestant\r\nchurches of Languedoc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nREORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH IN THE DESERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Church in the Desert is one of the most\r\ncurious things in history. Secret meetings of the Huguenots had long\r\nbeen held in France. They were began several years before the Act of\r\nRevocation was proclaimed, when the dragonnades were on foot, and\r\nwhile the Protestant temples were being demolished by the Government.\r\nThe Huguenots then arranged to meet and hold their worship in retired\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nAs the meetings were at first held, for the most part, in Languedoc,\r\nand as much of that province, especially in the district of the\r\nCevennes, is really waste and desert land, the meetings were at first\r\ncalled \"Assemblies in the Desert,\" and for nearly a hundred years they\r\nretained that name.\r\n\r\nWhen Court began to reorganize the Protestant Church in France,\r\nshortly after the Camisard war, meetings in the Desert had become\r\nalmost unknown. There were occasional prayer-meetings, at which\r\nchapters of the Bible were read or recited by those who remembered\r\nthem, and psalms were sung; but there were few or no meetings at which\r\npastors presided. Court, however, resolved not only to revive the\r\nmeetings of the Church in the Desert, but to reconstitute the\r\ncongregations, and restore the system of governing them according to\r\nthe methods of the Huguenot Church.\r\n\r\nThe first thing done in reconstituting a congregation, was to appoint\r\ncertain well-known religious men, as _anciens_ or elders. These were\r\nvery important officers. They formed the church in the first instance;\r\nfor where there were no elders, there was no church. They were members\r\nof the _consistoire_ or presbytery. They looked after the flock,\r\nvisited them in their families, made collections, named the pastors,\r\nand maintained peace, order, and discipline amongst the people. Though\r\nfirst nominated by the pastors, they were elected by the congregation;\r\nand the reason for their election was their known ability, zeal, and\r\npiety.\r\n\r\nThe elder was always present at the assemblies, though the minister\r\nwas absent. He prevented the members from succumbing to temptation and\r\nfalling away; he censured scandal; he kept up the flame of religious\r\nzeal, and encouraged the failing and helpless; he distributed amongst\r\nthe poorest the collections made and intrusted to him by the Church.\r\n\r\nWe have said that part of the duty of the elders was to censure\r\nscandal amongst the members. If their conduct was not considered\r\nbecoming the Christian life, they were not visited by the pastors and\r\nwere not allowed to attend the assemblies, until they had declared\r\ntheir determination to lead a better life. What a punishment for\r\ninfraction of discipline! to be debarred attending an assembly, for\r\nbeing present at which, the pastor, if detected, might be hanged, and\r\nthe penitent member sent to the galleys for life![54]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 54: C. Coquerel, \"Église du Désert,\" i. 105.]\r\n\r\nThe elders summoned the assemblies. They gave the word to a few\r\nfriends, and these spread the notice about amongst the rest. The news\r\nsoon became known, and in the course of a day or two, the members of\r\nthe congregation, though living perhaps in distant villages, would be\r\nduly informed of the time and place of the intended meeting. It was\r\nusually held at night,--in some secret place--in a cave, a hollow in\r\nthe woods, a ravine, or an abandoned farmstead.\r\n\r\nMen, women, and even children were taken thither, after one, two, or\r\nsometimes three leagues' walking. The meetings were always full of\r\ndanger, for spies were lurking about. Catholic priests were constant\r\ninformers; and soldiers were never far distant. But besides the\r\ndifficulties of spies and soldiers, the meetings were often dispersed\r\nby the rain in summer, or by the snow in winter.\r\n\r\nAfter the Camisard war, and before the appearance of Court, these\r\nmeetings rarely numbered more than a hundred persons. But Court and\r\nhis fellow-pastors often held meetings at which more than two thousand\r\npeople were present. On one occasion, not less than four thousand\r\npersons attended an assembly in Lower Languedoc.\r\n\r\nWhen the meetings were held by day, they were carefully guarded and\r\nwatched by sentinels on the look-out, especially in those places near\r\nwhich garrisons were stationed. The fleetest of the young men were\r\nchosen for this purpose. They watched the garrison exits, and when the\r\nsoldiers made a sortie, the sentinels communicated by signal from hill\r\nto hill, thus giving warning to the meeting to disperse. But the\r\nassemblies were mostly held at night; and even then the sentinels were\r\ncarefully posted about, but not at so great a distance.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the whole organization was the pastor. First, there were\r\nthe members entitled to church, privileges; next the _anciens_; and\r\nlastly the pastors. As in Presbyterianism, so in Huguenot Calvinism,\r\nits form of government was republican. The organization was based upon\r\nthe people who elected their elders; then upon the elders who selected\r\nand recommended the pastors; and lastly upon the whole congregation of\r\nmembers, elders, and pastors (represented in synods), who maintained\r\nthe entire organization of the Church.\r\n\r\nThere were three grades of service in the rank of pastor--first\r\nstudents, next preachers, and lastly pastors. Wonderful that there\r\nshould have been students of a profession, to follow which was almost\r\nequal to a sentence of death! But there were plenty of young\r\nenthusiasts ready to brave martyrdom in the service of the proscribed\r\nChurch. Sometimes it was even necessary to restrain them in their\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nCourt once wrote to Pierre Durand, at a time when the latter was\r\nrestoring order and organization in Viverais: \"Sound and examine well\r\nthe persons offering themselves for your approval, before permitting\r\nthem to enter on this glorious employment. Secure good, virtuous men,\r\nfull of zeal for the cause of truth. It is piety only that inspires\r\nnobility and greatness of soul. Piety sustains us under the most\r\nextreme dangers, and triumphs over the severest obstacles. The good\r\nconscience always marches forward with its head erect.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the character of the young applicants was approved, their studies\r\nthen proceeded, like everything else connected with the proscribed\r\nreligion, in secret. The students followed the professor and pastor in\r\nhis wanderings over the country, passing long nights in marching,\r\nsometimes hiding in caves by day, or sleeping under the stars by\r\nnight, passing from meeting to meeting, always with death looming\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\n\"I have often pitched my professor's chair,\" said Court, \"in a torrent\r\nunderneath a rock. The sky was our roof, and the leafy branches thrown\r\nout from the crevices in the rock overhead, were our canopy. There I\r\nand my students would remain for about eight days; it was our hall,\r\nour lecture-room, and our study. To make the most of our time, and to\r\npractise the students properly, I gave them a text of Scripture to\r\ndiscuss before me--say the first eleven verses of the fifth chapter of\r\nLuke. I would afterwards propose to them some point of doctrine, some\r\npassage of Scripture, some moral precept, or sometimes I gave them\r\nsome difficult passages to reconcile. After the whole had stated their\r\nviews upon the question under discussion, I asked the youngest if he\r\nhad anything to state against the arguments advanced; then the others\r\nwere asked in turn; and after they had finished, I stated the views\r\nwhich I considered most just and correct. When the more advanced\r\nstudents were required to preach, they mounted a particular place,\r\nwhere a pole had been set across some rocks in the ravine, and which\r\nfor the time served for a pulpit. And when they had delivered\r\nthemselves, the others were requested by turns to express themselves\r\nfreely upon the subject of the sermon which they had heard.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the _proposant_ or probationer was considered sufficiently able\r\nto preach, he was sent on a mission to visit the churches. Sometimes\r\nhe preached the approved sermons of other pastors; sometimes he\r\npreached his own sermons, after they had been examined by persons\r\nappointed by the synod. After a time, if approved by the moderator and\r\na committee of the synod, the _proposant_ was licensed to preach. His\r\nwork then resembled that of a pastor; but he could not yet administer\r\nthe sacrament. It was only when he had passed the synod, and been\r\nappointed by the laying on of hands, that he could exercise the higher\r\npastoral functions.\r\n\r\nThen, with respect to the maintenance of the pastors and preachers,\r\nCourt recounts, not without pride, that for the ten years between 1713\r\nand 1723 (excepting the years which he spent at Geneva), he served the\r\nHuguenot churches without receiving a farthing. His family and friends\r\nsaw to the supply of his private wants. With respect to the others,\r\nthey were supported by collections made at the assemblies; and, as the\r\npeople were nearly all poor, the amount collected was very small. On\r\none occasion, three assemblies produced a halfpenny and six\r\nhalf-farthings.\r\n\r\nBut a regular system of collecting moneys was framed by the synods\r\n(consisting of a meeting of pastors and elders), and out of the common\r\nfund so raised, emoluments were assigned, first to those preachers who\r\nwere married, and afterwards to those who were single. In either case\r\nthe pay was very small, scarcely sufficient to keep the wolf from the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe students for the ministry were at first educated by Court and\r\ntrained to preach, while he was on his dangerous journeys from one\r\nassembly in the Desert to another. Nor was the supply of preachers\r\nsufficient to visit the congregations already organized. Court had\r\nlong determined, so soon as the opportunity offered, of starting a\r\nschool for the special education of preachers and pastors, so that the\r\nwork he was engaged in might be more efficiently carried on. He at\r\nfirst corresponded with influential French refugees in England and\r\nHolland with reference to the subject. He wrote to Basnage and Saurin,\r\nbut they received his propositions coolly. He wrote to William Wake,\r\nthen Archbishop of Canterbury, who promised his assistance. At last\r\nCourt resolved to proceed into Switzerland, to stir up the French\r\nrefugees disposed to help him in his labours.\r\n\r\nArrived at Geneva, Court sought out M. Pictet, to whom he explained\r\nthe state of affairs in France. It had been rumoured amongst the\r\nforeign Protestants that fanaticism and \"inspiration\" were now in the\r\nascendant among the Protestants of France. Court showed that this was\r\nentirely a mistake, and that all which the proscribed Huguenots in\r\nFrance wanted, was a supply of properly educated pastors. The friends\r\nof true religion, and the enemies of fanaticism, ought therefore to\r\ncome to their help and supply them with that of which they stood most\r\nin need. If they would find teachers, Court would undertake to supply\r\nthem with congregations. And Huguenot congregations were rapidly\r\nincreasing, not only in Languedoc and Dauphiny, but in Normandy,\r\nPicardy, Poitou, Saintonge, Bearn, and the other provinces.\r\n\r\nAt length the subject became matured. It was not found desirable to\r\nestablish the proposed school at Geneva, that city being closely\r\nwatched by France, and frequently under the censure of its government\r\nfor giving shelter to refugee Frenchmen. It was eventually determined\r\nthat the college for the education of preachers should begin at\r\nLausanne. It was accordingly commenced in the year 1726, and\r\nestablished under the superintendence of M. Duplan.\r\n\r\nA committee of refugees called the \"Society of Help for the Afflicted\r\nFaithful,\" was formed at Lausanne to collect subscriptions for the\r\nmaintenance of the preachers, the pastors, and the seminary. These\r\nwere in the first place received from Huguenots settled in\r\nSwitzerland, afterwards increased by subscriptions obtained from\r\nrefugees settled in Holland, Germany, and England. The King of England\r\nsubscribed five hundred guineas yearly. Duplan was an indefatigable\r\nagent. In fourteen years he collected fourteen thousand pounds. By\r\nthese efforts the number of students was gradually increased. They\r\ncame from all parts of France, but chiefly from Languedoc. Between\r\n1726 (the year in which it was started) and 1753, ninety students had\r\npassed through the seminary.\r\n\r\nWhen the students had passed the range of study appointed by the\r\nprofessors, they returned from Switzerland to France to enter upon the\r\nwork of their lives. They had passed the school for martyrdom, and\r\nwere ready to preach to the assemblies--they had paved their way to\r\nthe scaffold!\r\n\r\nThe preachers always went abroad with their lives in their hands. They\r\ntravelled mostly by night, shunning the open highways, and selecting\r\nabandoned routes, often sheep-paths across the hills, to reach the\r\nscene of their next meeting. The trace of their steps is still marked\r\nupon the soil of the Cevennes, the people of the country still\r\nspeaking of the solitary routes taken by their instructors when\r\npassing from parish to parish, to preach to their fathers.\r\n\r\nThey were dressed, for disguise, in various ways; sometimes as\r\npeasants, as workmen, or as shepherds. On one occasion, Court and\r\nDuplan travelled the country disguised as officers! The police heard\r\nof it, and ordered their immediate arrest, pointing out the town and\r\nthe very house where they were to be taken. But the preachers escaped,\r\nand assumed a new dress.\r\n\r\nWhen living near Nismes, Court was one day seated under a tree\r\ncomposing a sermon, when a party of soldiers, hearing that he was in\r\nthe neighbourhood, came within sight. Court climbed up into the tree,\r\nwhere he remained concealed among the branches, and thus contrived to\r\nescape their search.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, he was staying with a friend, in whose house he\r\nhad slept during the previous night. A detachment of troops suddenly\r\nsurrounded the house, and the officer knocked loudly at the door.\r\nCourt made his friend go at once to bed pretending to be ill, while he\r\nhimself cowered down in the narrow space between the bed and the wall.\r\nHis wife slowly answered the door, which the soldiers were threatening\r\nto blow open. They entered, rummaged the house, opened all the chests\r\nand closets, sounded the walls, examined the sick man's room, and\r\nfound nothing!\r\n\r\nCourt himself, as well as the other pastors, worked very hard. On one\r\noccasion, Court made a round of visits in Lower Languedoc and in the\r\nCevennes, at first alone, and afterwards accompanied by a young\r\npreacher. In the space of two months and a few days he visited\r\nthirty-one churches, holding assemblies, preaching, and administering\r\nthe sacrament, during which he travelled over three hundred miles. The\r\nweather did not matter to the pastors--rain nor snow, wind nor storm,\r\nnever hindered them. They took the road and braved all. Even sickness\r\noften failed to stay them. Sickness might weaken but did not overthrow\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe spies and police so abounded throughout the country, and were so\r\nactive, that they knew all the houses in which the preachers might\r\ntake refuge. A list of these was prepared and placed in the hands of\r\nthe intendant of the province.[55] If preachers were found in them,\r\nboth the shelterers and the sheltered knew what they had to expect.\r\nThe whole property and goods of the former were confiscated and they\r\nwere sent to the galleys for life; and the latter were first tortured\r\nby the rack, and then hanged. The houses in which preachers were found\r\nwere almost invariably burnt down.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 55: It has since been published in the \"Bulletin de\r\n         la Société du Protestantisme Français.\"]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great secrecy with which the whole organization\r\nproceeded, preachers were frequently apprehended, assemblies were\r\noften surprised, and many persons were imprisoned and sent to the\r\ngalleys for life. Each village had its chief spy--the priest; and\r\nbeneath the priest there were a number of other spies--spies for\r\nmoney, spies for cruelty, spies for revenge.\r\n\r\nWas an assembly of Huguenots about to be held? A spy, perhaps a\r\ntraitor, would make it known. The priest's order was sufficient for\r\nthe captain of the nearest troop of soldiers to proceed to disperse\r\nit. They marched and surrounded the assembly. A sound of volley-firing\r\nwas heard. The soldiers shot down, hanged, or made prisoners of the\r\nunlawful worshippers. Punishments were sudden, and inquiry was never\r\nmade into them, however brutal. There was the fire for Bibles,\r\nTestaments, and psalm-books; galleys for men; prisons and convents for\r\nwomen; and gibbets for preachers.\r\n\r\nIn 1720 a large number of prisoners were captured in the famous old\r\nquarry near Nismes, long the seat of secret Protestant worship. But\r\nthe troops surrounded the meeting suddenly, and the whole were taken.\r\nThe women were sent for life to the Tour de Constance, and the men,\r\nchained in gangs, were sent all through France to La Rochelle, to be\r\nimprisoned in the galleys there. The ambassador of England made\r\nintercession for the prisoners, and their sentence was commuted into\r\none of perpetual banishment from France. They were accordingly\r\ntransported to New Orleans on the Mississippi, to populate the rising\r\nFrench colony in that quarter of North America.\r\n\r\nThus crimes abounded, and cruelty when practised upon Huguenots was\r\nnever investigated. The seizure and violation of women was common.\r\nFathers knew the probable consequence when their daughters were\r\nseized. The daughter of a Huguenot was seized at Uzes, in 1733, when\r\nthe father immediately died of grief. Two sisters were seized at the\r\nsame place to be \"converted,\" and their immediate relations were\r\nthrown into gaol in the meantime. This was a common proceeding. The\r\nTour de Constance was always filling, and kept full.\r\n\r\nThe dying were tortured. If they refused the viaticum they were\r\ntreated as \"damned persons.\" When Jean de Molènes of Cahors died,\r\nmaking a profession of Protestantism, his body was denounced as\r\ndamned, and it was abandoned without sepulture. A woman who addressed\r\nsome words of consolation to Joseph Martin when dying was condemned to\r\npay a fine of six thousand livres, and be imprisoned in the castle of\r\nBeauregard; and as for Martin, his memory was declared to be damned\r\nfor ever. Many such outrages to the living and dead were constantly\r\noccurring.[56] Gaolers were accustomed to earn money by exhibiting the\r\ncorpses of Huguenot women at fairs, inviting those who paid for\r\nadmission, to walk up and \"see the corpse of a damned person.\"[57]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 56: Edmund Hughes, \"Histoire de la Restauration du\r\n         Protestantisme en France,\" ii. 94.]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 57: Bénoît, \"Edit de Nantes,\" v. 987.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all these cruelties, Protestantism was making\r\nconsiderable progress, both in Languedoc and Dauphiny. In reorganizing\r\nthe Church, the whole country had been divided into districts, and\r\npreachers and pastors endeavoured to visit the whole of their members\r\nwith as much regularity as possible. Thus Languedoc was divided into\r\nseven districts, and to each of those a _proposant_ or probationary\r\npreacher was appointed. The presbyteries and synods met regularly and\r\nsecretly in a cave, or the hollow bed of a river, or among the\r\nmountains. They cheered each other up, though their progress was\r\nusually over the bodies of their dead friends.\r\n\r\nFor any pastor or preacher to be apprehended, was, of course, certain\r\ndeath. Thus, out of thirteen Huguenots who were found worshipping in a\r\nprivate apartment at Montpellier, in 1723, Vesson, the pastor, and\r\nBonicel and Antoine Comte, his assistants, were at once condemned and\r\nhanged on the Peyrou, the other ten persons being imprisoned or sent\r\nto the galleys for life.\r\n\r\nShortly after, Huc, the aged pastor, was taken prisoner in the\r\nCevennes, brought to Montpellier, and hanged in the same place. A\r\nreward of a thousand livres was offered by Bernage, the intendant, for\r\nthe heads of the remaining preachers, the fatal list comprising the\r\nnames of Court, Cortez, Durand, Rouviere, Bombonnoux, and others. The\r\nnames of these \"others\" were not mentioned, not being yet thought\r\nworthy of the gibbet.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was at this time that the Bishop of Alais made an appeal to\r\nthe government against the toleration shown to the Huguenots! In 1723,\r\nhe sent a long memorial to Paris, alleging that Catholicism was\r\nsuffering a serious injury; that not only had the \"new converts\"\r\nwithdrawn themselves from the Catholic Church, but that the old\r\nCatholics themselves were resorting to the Huguenot assemblies; that\r\nsometimes their meetings numbered from three to four thousand persons;\r\nthat their psalms were sometimes overheard in the surrounding\r\nvillages; that the churches were becoming deserted, the curés in some\r\nparishes not being able to find a single Catholic to serve at Mass;\r\nthat the Protestants had ceased to send their children to school, and\r\nwere baptized and married without the intervention of the Church.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these representations, the then Regent, the Duke of\r\nBourbon, sent down an urgent order to the authorities to carry out the\r\nlaw--to prevent meetings, under penalty of death to preachers, and\r\nimprisonment at the galleys to all who attended them, ordering that\r\nthe people should be _forced_ to go to church and the children to\r\nschool, and reviving generally the severe laws against Protestantism\r\nissued by Louis XIV. The result was that many of the assemblies were\r\nshortly after attacked and dispersed, many persons were made prisoners\r\nand sent to the galleys, and many more preachers were apprehended,\r\nracked, and hanged.\r\n\r\nRepeated attempts were made to apprehend Antoine Court, as being the\r\nsoul of the renewed Protestant organization. A heavy reward was\r\noffered for his head. The spies and police hunted after him in all\r\ndirections. Houses where he was supposed to be concealed were\r\nsurrounded by soldiers at night, and every hole and corner in them\r\nransacked. Three houses were searched in one night. Court sometimes\r\nescaped with great difficulty. On one occasion he remained concealed\r\nfor more than twenty hours under a heap of manure. His friends\r\nendeavoured to persuade him to leave the country until the activity of\r\nthe search for him had passed.\r\n\r\nSince the year 1722, Court had undertaken new responsibilities. He had\r\nbecome married, and was now the father of three children. He had\r\nmarried a young Huguenot woman of Uzes. He first met her in her\r\nfather's house, while he was in hiding from the spies. While he was\r\nengaged in his pastoral work his wife and family continued to live at\r\nUzes. Court was never seen in her company, but could only visit his\r\nfamily secretly. The woman was known to be of estimable character, but\r\nit gave rise to suspicions that she had three children without a known\r\nfather. The spies were endeavouring to unravel the secret, tempted by\r\nthe heavy reward offered for Court's head.\r\n\r\nOne day the new commandant of the town, passing before the door of the\r\nhouse where Court's wife lived, stopped, and, pointing to the house,\r\nput some questions to the neighbours. Court was informed of this, and\r\nimmediately supposed that his house had become known, that his wife\r\nand family had been discovered and would be apprehended. He at once\r\nmade arrangements for having them removed to Geneva. They reached that\r\ncity in safety, in the month of April, 1729.\r\n\r\nShortly after, Court, still wandering and preaching about Languedoc,\r\nbecame seriously ill. He feared for his wife, he feared for his\r\nfamily, and conceived the design of joining them in Switzerland. A few\r\nmonths later, exhausted by his labours and continued illness, he left\r\nLanguedoc and journeyed by slow stages to Geneva. He was still a young\r\nman, only thirty-three; but he had worked excessively hard during the\r\nlast dozen years. Since the age of fourteen, in fact, he had\r\nevangelized Languedoc.\r\n\r\nShortly before Court left France for Switzerland, the preacher,\r\nAlexandre Roussel, was, in the year 1728, added to the number of\r\nmartyrs. He was only twenty-six years of age. The occasion on which he\r\nwas made prisoner was while attending an assembly near Vigan. The\r\nwhole of the people had departed, and Roussel was the last to leave\r\nthe meeting. He was taken to Montpellier, and imprisoned in the\r\ncitadel, which had before held so many Huguenot pastors. He was asked\r\nto abjure, and offered a handsome bribe if he would become a Catholic.\r\nHe refused to deny his faith, and was sentenced to die. When Antoine\r\nCourt went to offer consolation to his mother, she replied, \"If my son\r\nhad given way I should have been greatly distressed; but as he died\r\nwith constancy, I thank God for strengthening him to perform this last\r\nwork in his service.\"\r\n\r\nCourt did not leave his brethren in France without the expostulations\r\nof his friends. They alleged that his affection for his wife and\r\nfamily had cooled his zeal for God's service. Duplan and Cortez\r\nexpostulated with him; and the churches of Languedoc, which he himself\r\nhad established, called upon him to return to his duties amongst them.\r\n\r\nBut Court did not attend to their request. His determination was for\r\nthe present unshaken. He had a long arrears of work to do in quiet. He\r\nhad money to raise for the support of the suffering Church of France,\r\nand for the proper maintenance of the college for students, preachers,\r\nand pastors. He had to help the refugees, who still continued to leave\r\nFrance for Switzerland, and to write letters and rouse the Protestant\r\nkingdoms of the north, as Brousson had done before him some thirty\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nThe city of Berne was very generous in its treatment of Court and the\r\nHuguenots generally. The Bernish Government allotted Court a pension\r\nof five hundred livres a-year--for he was without the means of\r\nsupporting his family--all his own and his wife's property having been\r\nseized and sequestrated in France. Court preached with great success\r\nin the principal towns of Switzerland, more particularly at Berne, and\r\nafterwards at Lausanne, where he spent the rest of his days.\r\n\r\nThough he worked there more peacefully, he laboured as continuously as\r\never in the service of the Huguenot churches. He composed addresses to\r\nthem; he educated preachers and pastors for them; and one of his\r\nprincipal works, while at Lausanne, was to compose a history of the\r\nHuguenots in France subsequent to the Revocation of the Edict of\r\nNantes.\r\n\r\nWhat he had done for the reorganization of the Huguenot Church in\r\nFrance may be thus briefly stated. Court had begun his work in 1715,\r\nat which time there was no settled congregation in the South of\r\nFrance. The Huguenots were only ministered to by occasional wandering\r\npastors. In 1729, the year in which Court finally left France, there\r\nwere in Lower Languedoc 29 organized, though secretly governed,\r\nchurches; in Upper Languedoc, 11; in the Cevennes, 18; in the Lozère\r\n12; and in Viverais, 42 churches. There were now over 200,000\r\nrecognised Protestants in Languedoc alone. The ancient discipline had\r\nbeen restored; 120 churches had been organized; a seminary for the\r\neducation of preachers and pastors had been established; and\r\nProtestantism was extending in Dauphiny, Bearn, Saintonge,[58] and\r\nother quarters.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 58: In 1726, a deputation from Guyenne, Royergue,\r\n         and Poitou, appeared before the Languedoc synod, requesting\r\n         preachers and pastors to be sent to them. The synod agreed to\r\n         send Maroger as preacher. Bètrine (the first of the Lausanne\r\n         students) and Grail were afterwards sent to join him.\r\n         Protestantism was also reawakening in Saintonge and Picardy,\r\n         and pastors from Languedoc journeyed there to administer the\r\n         sacrament. Preachers were afterwards sent to join them, to\r\n         awaken the people, and reorganize the congregations.]\r\n\r\nSuch were, in a great measure, the results of the labours of Antoine\r\nCourt and his assistants during the previous fifteen years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH IN THE DESERT, 1730-62--PAUL RABAUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe persecutions of the Huguenots increased at one time and relaxed at\r\nanother. When France was at war, and the soldiers were fighting in\r\nFlanders or on the Rhine, the bishops became furious, and complained\r\nbitterly to the government of the toleration shown to the Protestants.\r\nThe reason was that there were no regiments at liberty to pursue the\r\nHuguenots and disperse their meetings in the Desert. When the soldiers\r\nreturned from the wars, persecution began again.\r\n\r\nIt usually began with the seizing and burning of books. The\r\nbook-burning days were considered amongst the great days of fête.\r\n\r\nOne day in June, 1730, the Intendant of Languedoc visited Nismes,\r\nescorted by four battalions of troops. On arriving, the principal\r\nCatholics were selected, and placed as commissaries to watch the\r\nhouses of the suspected Huguenots. At night, while the inhabitants\r\nslept, the troops turned out, and the commissaries pointed out the\r\nHuguenot houses to be searched. The inmates were knocked up, the\r\nsoldiers entered, the houses were rummaged, and all the books that\r\ncould be found were taken to the Hôtel de Ville.\r\n\r\nA few days after a great _auto-da-fé_ was held. The entire Catholic\r\npopulation turned out. There were the four battalions of troops, the\r\ngendarmes, the Catholic priests, and the chief dignitaries; and in\r\ntheir presence all the Huguenot books were destroyed. They were thrown\r\ninto a pile on the usual place of execution, and the hangman set fire\r\nto this great mass of Bibles, psalm-books, catechisms, and\r\nsermons.[59] The officers laughed, the priests sneered, the multitude\r\ncheered. These bonfires were of frequent occurrence in all the towns\r\nof Languedoc.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 59: E. Hughes, \"Histoire de la Restauration, du\r\n         Protestantisme en France,\" ii. 96.]\r\n\r\nBut if the priests hated the printed word, still more did they hate\r\nthe spoken word. They did not like the Bible, but they hated the\r\npreachers. Fines, _auto-da-fés_, condemnation to the galleys, seizures\r\nof women and girls, and profanation of the dead, were tolerable\r\npunishments, but there was nothing like hanging a preacher. \"Nothing,\"\r\nsaid Saint-Florentin to the commandant of La Devese, \"can produce more\r\nimpression than hanging a preacher; and it is very desirable that you\r\nshould immediately take steps to arrest one of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe commandant obeyed orders, and apprehended Pierre Durand. He was on\r\nhis way to baptize the child of one of his congregation, who lived on\r\na farm in Viverais. An apparent peasant, who seemed to be waiting his\r\napproach, offered to conduct him to the farm. Durand followed him. The\r\npeasant proved to be a soldier in disguise. He led Durand directly\r\ninto the midst of his troop. There he was bound and carried off to\r\nMontpellier.\r\n\r\nDurand was executed at the old place--the Peyrou--the soldiers\r\nbeating their drums to stifle his voice while he prayed. His corpse\r\nwas laid beside that of Alexandre Roussel, under the rampart of the\r\nfortress of Montpellier. Durand was the last of the preachers in\r\nFrance who had attended the synod of 1715. They had all been executed,\r\nexcepting only Antoine Court, who was safe in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe priests were not so successful with Claris, the preacher, who\r\ncontrived to escape their clutches. Claris had just reached France on\r\nhis return from the seminary at Lausanne. He had taken shelter for the\r\nnight with a Protestant friend at Foissac, near Uzes. Scarcely had he\r\nfallen asleep, when the soldiers, informed by the spies, entered his\r\nchamber, bound him, and marched him off on foot by night, to Alais. He\r\nwas thrown into gaol, and was afterwards judged and condemned to\r\ndeath. His friends in Alais, however, secretly contrived to get an\r\niron chisel passed to him in prison. He raised the stone of a chamber\r\nwhich communicated with his dungeon, descended to the ground, and\r\nsilently leapt the wall. He was saved.\r\n\r\nPastors and preachers continued to be tracked and hunted with renewed\r\nardour in Saintonge, Poitou, Gascony, and Dauphiny. \"The Chase,\" as it\r\nwas called, was better organized than it had been for twenty years\r\npreviously. The Catholic clergy, however, continued to complain. The\r\nchase, they said, was not productive enough! The hangings of pastors\r\nwere too few. The curates of the Cevennes thus addressed the\r\nintendants: \"You do not perform your duty: you are neither active\r\nenough nor pitiless enough;\"[60] and they requested the government to\r\nadopt more vigorous measures.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 60: E. Hughes, ii. 99. Coquerel, \"L'Église dans le\r\n         Désert,\" i. 258.]\r\n\r\nThe intendants, who were thus accused, insisted that they _had_ done\r\ntheir duty. They had hanged all the Huguenot preachers that the\r\npriests and their spies had discovered and brought to them. They had\r\nalso offered increased rewards for the preachers' heads. If\r\nProtestantism counted so large a number of adherents, _they_ were\r\nsurely not to blame for that! Had the priests themselves done _their_\r\nduty? Thus the intendants and the curés reproached each other by\r\nturns.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the pastors and preachers had not been spared. They had been\r\nhanged without mercy. They knew they were in the peril of constant\r\ndeath. \"I have slept fifteen days in a meadow,\" wrote Cortez, the\r\npastor, \"and I write this under a tree.\" Morel, the preacher, when\r\nattending an assembly, was fired at by the soldiers and died of his\r\nwounds. Pierre Dortial was also taken prisoner when holding an\r\nassembly. The host with whom he lived was condemned to the galleys for\r\nlife; the arrondissement in which the assembly had been held was\r\ncompelled to pay a fine of three thousand livres; and Dortial himself\r\nwas sentenced to be hanged. When the aged preacher was informed of his\r\nsentence he exclaimed: \"What an honour for me, oh my God! to have been\r\nchosen from so many others to suffer death because of my constancy to\r\nthe truth.\" He was executed at Nismes, and died with courage.\r\n\r\nIn 1742 France was at war, and the Huguenots enjoyed a certain amount\r\nof liberty. The edicts against them were by no means revoked; their\r\nexecution was merely suspended. The provinces were stripped of troops,\r\nand the clergy could no longer call upon them to scatter the meetings\r\nin the Desert. Hence the assemblies increased. The people began to\r\nthink that the commandants of the provinces had received orders to\r\nshut their eyes, and see nothing of the proceedings of the Huguenots.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting held in a valley between Calvisson and Langlade, in\r\nLanguedoc, no fewer than ten thousand persons openly met for worship.\r\nNo troops appeared. There was no alarm nor surprise. Everything passed\r\nin perfect quiet. In many other places, public worship was celebrated,\r\nthe sacrament was administered, children were baptized, and marriages\r\nwere celebrated in the open day.[61]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 61: Although marriages by the pastors had long been\r\n         declared illegal, they nevertheless married and baptized in\r\n         the Desert. After 1730, the number of Protestant marriages\r\n         greatly multiplied, though it was known that the issue of\r\n         such marriages were declared, by the laws of France to be\r\n         illegal. Many of the Protestants of Dauphiny went across the\r\n         frontier into Switzerland, principally to Geneva, and were\r\n         there married.]\r\n\r\nThe Catholics again urgently complained to the government of the\r\nincreasing number of Huguenot meetings. The Bishop of Poitiers\r\ncomplained that in certain parishes of his diocese there was not now a\r\nsingle Catholic. Low Poitou contained thirty Protestant churches,\r\ndivided into twelve arrondissements, and each arrondissement contained\r\nabout seven thousand members. The Procureur-Général of Normandy said,\r\n\"All this country is full of Huguenots.\" But the government had at\r\npresent no troops to spare, and the Catholic bishops and clergy must\r\nnecessarily wait until the war with the English and the Austrians had\r\ncome to an end.\r\n\r\nAntoine Court paid a short visit to Languedoc in 1744, to reconcile a\r\ndifference which had arisen in the Church through the irregular\r\nconduct of Pastor Boyer. Court was received with great enthusiasm, and\r\nwhen Boyer was re-established in his position as pastor, after making\r\nhis submission to the synod, a convocation of Huguenots was held near\r\nSauzet, at which thousands of people were present. Court remained for\r\nabout a month in France, preaching almost daily to immense audiences.\r\nAt Nismes, he preached at the famous place for Huguenot meetings--in\r\nthe old quarry, about three miles from the town. There were about\r\ntwenty thousand persons present, ranged, as in an amphitheatre, along\r\nthe sides of the quarry. It was a most impressive sight. Peasants and\r\ngentlemen mixed together. Even the \"beau monde\" of Nismes was present.\r\nEverybody thought that there was now an end of the persecution.[62]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 62: Of the preachers about this time (1740-4) the\r\n         best known were Morel, Foriel, Mauvillon, Voulaud, Corteiz,\r\n         Peyrot, Roux, Gauch, Coste, Dugnière, Blachon, Gabriac,\r\n         Déjours, Rabaut, Gibert, Mignault, Désubas, Dubesset, Pradel,\r\n         Morin, Defferre, Loire, Pradon,--with many more. Defferre\r\n         restored Protestantism in Berne. Loire (a native of St. Omer,\r\n         and formerly a Catholic), Viala, Préneuf, and Prudon, were\r\n         the apostles of Normandy, Rouergue, Guyenne, and Poitou.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the clergy continued to show signs of increasing\r\nirritation. They complained, denounced, and threatened. Various\r\ncalumnies were invented respecting the Huguenots. The priests of\r\nDauphiny gave out that Roger, the pastor, had read an edict purporting\r\nto be signed by Louis XV. granting complete toleration to the\r\nHuguenots! The report was entirely without foundation, and Roger\r\nindignantly denied that he had read any such edict. But the report\r\nreached the ears of the King, then before Ypres with his army; on\r\nwhich he issued a proclamation announcing that the rumour publicly\r\ncirculated that it was his intention to tolerate the Huguenots was\r\nabsolutely false.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the war terminated, and the army returned to France,\r\nthan the persecutions recommenced as hotly as ever. The citizens of\r\nNismes, for having recently encouraged the Huguenots and attended\r\nCourt's great meeting, were heavily fined. All the existing laws for\r\nthe repression and destruction of Protestantism were enforced.\r\nSuspected persons were apprehended and imprisoned without trial. A new\r\n\"hunt\" was set on foot for preachers. There were now plenty of\r\nsoldiers at liberty to suppress the meetings in the Desert, and they\r\nwere ordered into the infested quarters. In a word, persecution was\r\nlet loose all over France. Nor was it without the usual results. It\r\nwas very hot in Dauphiny. There a detachment of horse police,\r\naccompanied by regular troops and a hangman, ran through the province\r\nearly in 1745, spreading terror everywhere. One of their exploits was\r\nto seize a sick old Huguenot, drag him from his bed, and force him\r\ntowards prison. He died upon the road.\r\n\r\nIn February, it was ascertained that the Huguenots met for worship in\r\na certain cavern. The owner of the estate on which the cavern was\r\nsituated, though unaware of the meetings, was fined a thousand crowns,\r\nand imprisoned for a year in the Castle of Cret.\r\n\r\nNext month, Louis Ranc, a pastor, was seized at Livron while baptizing\r\nan infant, taken to Die, and hanged. He had scarcely breathed his\r\nlast, when the hangman cut the cord, hewed off the head, and made a\r\nyoung Protestant draw the corpse along the streets of Die.\r\n\r\nIn the month of April, 1745, Jacques Roger, the old friend and\r\ncoadjutor of Court--the apostle of Dauphiny as Court had been of\r\nLanguedoc--was taken prisoner and conducted to Grenoble. Roger was\r\nthen eighty years old, worn out with privation and hard work. He was\r\ncondemned to death. He professed his joy at being still able to seal\r\nwith his blood the truths he had so often proclaimed. On his way to\r\nthe scaffold, he sang aloud the fifty-first Psalm. He was executed in\r\nthe Place du Breuil. After he had hung for twenty-four hours, his body\r\nwas taken down, dragged along the streets of Grenoble, and thrown into\r\nthe Isère.\r\n\r\nAt Grenoble also, in the same year, seven persons were condemned to\r\nthe galleys. A young woman was publicly whipped at the same place for\r\nattending a Huguenot meeting. Seven students and pastors who could not\r\nbe found, were hanged in effigy. Four houses were demolished for\r\nhaving served as asylums for preachers. Fines were levied on all\r\nsides, and punishments of various kinds were awarded to many hundred\r\npersons. Thus persecution ran riot in Dauphiny in the years 1745 and\r\n1746.\r\n\r\nIn Languedoc it was the same. The prisons and the galleys were always\r\nkept full. Dragoons were quartered in the Huguenot villages, and by\r\nthis means the inhabitants were soon ruined. The soldiers pillaged the\r\nhouses, destroyed the furniture, tore up the linen, drank all the\r\nwine, and, when they were in good humour, followed the cattle, swine,\r\nand fowl, and killed them off sword in hand. Montauban, an old\r\nHuguenot town, was thus ruined in the course of a very few months.\r\n\r\nOne day, in a Languedoc village, a soldier seized a young girl with a\r\nfoul intention. She cried aloud, and the villagers came to her rescue.\r\nThe dragoons turned out in a body, and fired upon the people. An old\r\nman was shot dead, a number of the villagers were taken prisoners,\r\nand, with their hands tied to the horses' tails, were conducted for\r\npunishment to Montauban.\r\n\r\nAll the towns and villages in Upper Languedoc were treated with the\r\nsame cruelty. Nismes was fined over and over again. Viverais was\r\ntreated with the usual severity. M. Désubas, the pastor, was taken\r\nprisoner there, and conducted to Vernoux. As the soldiers led him\r\nthrough the country to prison, the villagers came out in crowds to see\r\nhim pass. Many followed the pastor, thinking they might be able to\r\ninduce the magistrates of Vernoux to liberate him. The villagers were\r\nno sooner cooped up in a mass in the chief street of the town, than\r\nthey were suddenly fired upon by the soldiers. Thirty persons were\r\nkilled on the spot, more than two hundred were wounded, and many\r\nafterwards died of their wounds.\r\n\r\nDésubas, the pastor, was conducted to Nismes, and from Nismes to\r\nMontpellier. While on his way to death at Montpellier, some of his\r\npeasant friends, who lived along the road, determined to rescue him.\r\nBut when Paul Rabaut heard of the proposed attempt, he ran to the\r\nplace where the people had assembled and held them back. He was\r\nopposed to all resistance to the governing power, and thought it\r\npossible, by patience and righteousness, to live down all this\r\nhorrible persecution.\r\n\r\nDésubas was judged, and, as usual, condemned to death. Though it was\r\nwinter time, he was led to his punishment almost naked; his legs\r\nuncovered, and only in thin linen vest over his body. Arrived at the\r\ngallows, his books and papers were burnt before his eyes, and he was\r\nthen delivered over to the executioner. A Jesuit presented a crucifix\r\nfor him to kiss, but he turned his head to one side, raised his eyes\r\nupwards, and was then hanged.\r\n\r\nThe same persecution prevailed over the greater part of France. In\r\nSaintonge, Elie Vivien, the preacher, was taken prisoner, and hanged\r\nat La Rochelle. His body remained for twenty-four hours on the\r\ngallows. It was then placed upon a forked gibbet, where it hung until\r\nthe bones were picked clean by the crows and bleached by the wind and\r\nthe sun.[63]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 63: E. Hughes, \"Histoire de la Restauration,\" &c.,\r\n         ii. 202.]\r\n\r\nThe same series of persecutions went on from one year to another. It\r\nwas a miserable monotony of cruelty. There was hanging for the\r\npastors; the galleys for men attending meetings in the Desert; the\r\nprisons and convents for women and children. Wherever it was found\r\nthat persons had been married by the Huguenot pastors, they were haled\r\nbefore the magistrate, fined and imprisoned, and told that they had\r\nbeen merely living in concubinage, and that their children were\r\nillegitimate.\r\n\r\nSometimes it was thought that the persecutors would relent. France was\r\nagain engaged in a disastrous war with England and Austria; and it was\r\nfeared that England would endeavour to stir up a rebellion amongst the\r\nHuguenots. But the pastors met in a general synod, and passed\r\nresolutions assuring the government of their loyalty to the King,[64]\r\nand of their devotion to the laws of France!\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 64: On the 1st of November, 1746, the ministers of\r\n         Languedoc met in haste, and wrote to the Intendant, Le Nain:\r\n         \"Monseigneur, nous n'avons aucune connaissance de ces gens\r\n         qu'on appelle émissaires, et qu'on dit être envoyés des pays\r\n         étrangers pour solliciter les Protestants à la révolte. Nous\r\n         avons exhorté, et nous nous proposons d'exhorter encore dans\r\n         toutes les occasions, nos troupeaux à la soumission au\r\n         souverain et à la patience dans les afflictions, et de nous\r\n         écarter jamais de la pratique de ce précepte: Craignez Dieu\r\n         et honorez le roi.\"]\r\n\r\nTheir \"loyalty\" proved of no use. The towns of Languedoc were as\r\nheavily fined as before, for attending meetings in the Desert.[65]\r\nChildren were, as usual, taken away from their parents and placed in\r\nJesuit convents. Le Nain apprehended Jean Desjours, and had him hanged\r\nat Montpellier, on the ground that he had accompanied the peasants\r\nwho, as above recited, went into Vernoux after the martyr Désubas.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 65: Près de Saint-Ambroix (Cevennes) se tint un\r\n         jour une assemblée. Survint un détachement. Les femmes et les\r\n         filles furent dépouillées, violées, et quelques hommes furent\r\n         blessés.--E. HUGHES, _Histoire de la Restauration, &c._, ii.\r\n         212.]\r\n\r\nThe Catholics would not even allow Protestant corpses to be buried in\r\npeace. At Levaur a well-known Huguenot died. Two of his friends went\r\nto dig a grave for him by night; they were observed by spies and\r\ninformed against. By dint of money and entreaties, however, the\r\nfriends succeeded in getting the dead man buried. The populace,\r\nstirred up by the White Penitents (monks), opened the grave, took out\r\nthe corpse, sawed the head from the body, and prepared to commit\r\nfurther outrages, when the police interfered, and buried the body\r\nagain, in consideration of the large sum that had been paid to the\r\nauthorities for its interment.\r\n\r\nThe populace were always wild for an exhibition of cruelty. In\r\nProvence, a Protestant named Montague died, and was secretly interred.\r\nThe Catholics having discovered the place where he was buried\r\ndetermined to disinter him. The grave was opened, and the corpse taken\r\nout. A cord was attached to the neck, and the body was hauled through\r\nthe village to the music of a tambourine and flageolet. At every step\r\nit was kicked or mauled by the crowd who accompanied it. Under the\r\nkicks the corpse burst. The furious brutes then took out the entrails\r\nand attached them to poles, going through the village crying, \"Who\r\nwants preachings? Who wants preachings?\"[66]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 66: Antoine Court, \"Mémoire Historique,\" 140.]\r\n\r\nTo such a pitch of brutality had the kings of France and their\r\ninstigators, the Jesuits--who, since the Revocation of the Edict, had\r\nnearly the whole education of the country in their hands--reduced the\r\npeople; from whom they were themselves, however, to suffer almost an\r\nequal amount of indignity.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these hangings and cruelties, the bishops again\r\ncomplained bitterly of the tolerance granted to the Huguenots. M. de\r\nMontclus, Bishop of Alais, urged \"that the true cause of all the evils\r\nthat afflict the country was the relaxation of the laws against heresy\r\nby the magistrates, that they gave themselves no trouble to persecute\r\nthe Protestants, and that their further emigration from the kingdom\r\nwas no more to be feared than formerly.\" It was, they alleged, a great\r\ndanger to the country that there should be in it two millions of men\r\nallowed to live without church and outside the law.[67]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 67: See \"Memorial of General Assembly of Clergy to\r\n         the King,\" in _Collection des procès-verbaux_, 345.]\r\n\r\nThe afflicted Church at this time had many misfortunes to contend\r\nwith. In 1748, the noble, self-denying, indefatigable Claris died--one\r\nof the few Protestant pastors who died in his bed. In 1750, the\r\neloquent young preacher, François Benezet,[68] was taken and hanged at\r\nMontpellier. Meetings in the Desert were more vigorously attacked and\r\ndispersed, and when surrounded by the soldiers, most persons were\r\nshot; the others were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 68: The King granted 480 livres of reward to the\r\n         spy who detected Benezet and procured his apprehension by the\r\n         soldiers.]\r\n\r\nThe Huguenot pastors repeatedly addressed Louis XV. and his ministers,\r\nappealing to them for protection as loyal subjects. In 1750 they\r\naddressed the King in a new memorial, respectfully representing that\r\ntheir meetings for public worship, sacraments, baptisms, and\r\nmarriages, were matters of conscience. They added: \"Your troops pursue\r\nus in the deserts as if we were wild beasts; our property is\r\nconfiscated; our children are torn from us; we are condemned to the\r\ngalleys; and although our ministers continually exhort us to discharge\r\nour duty as good citizens and faithful subjects, a price is set upon\r\ntheir heads, and when they are taken, they are cruelly executed.\" But\r\nLouis XV. and his ministers gave no greater heed to this petition than\r\nthey had done to those which had preceded it.\r\n\r\nAfter occasional relays the Catholic persecutions again broke out. In\r\n1752 there was a considerable emigration in consequence of a new\r\nintendant having been appointed to Languedoc. The Catholics called\r\nupon him to put in force the powers of the law. New brooms sweep\r\nclean. The Intendant proceeded to carry out the law with such ferocity\r\nas to excite great terror throughout the province. Meetings were\r\nsurrounded; prisoners taken and sent to the galleys; and all the gaols\r\nand convents were filled with women and children.\r\n\r\nThe emigration began again. Many hundred persons went to Holland; and\r\na still larger number went to settle with their compatriots as silk\r\nand poplin weavers in Dublin. The Intendant of Languedoc tried to stop\r\ntheir flight. The roads were again watched as before. All the outlets\r\nfrom the kingdom were closed by the royalist troops. Many of the\r\nintending emigrants were made prisoners. They were spoiled of\r\neverything, robbed of their money, and thrown into gaol. Nevertheless,\r\nanother large troop started, passed through Switzerland, and reached\r\nIreland at the end of the year.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, emigration was going on from Normandy and Poitou,\r\nwhere persecution was compelling the people to fly from their own\r\nshores and take refuge in England. This religious emigration of 1752\r\nwas, however, almost the last which took place from France. Though the\r\npersecutions were drawing to an end, they had not yet come to a close.\r\n\r\nIn 1754, the young pastor Tessier (called Lafage), had just returned\r\nfrom Lausanne, where he had been pursuing his studies for three years.\r\nHe had been tracked by a spy to a certain house, where he had spent\r\nthe night. Next morning the house was surrounded by soldiers. Tessier\r\ntried to escape by getting out of a top window and running along the\r\nroofs of the adjoining houses. A soldier saw him escaping and shot at\r\nhim. He was severely wounded in the arm. He was captured, taken before\r\nthe Intendant of Languedoc, condemned, and hanged in the course of the\r\nsame day.\r\n\r\nReligious meetings also continued to be surrounded, and were treated\r\nin the usual brutal manner. For instance, an assembly was held in\r\nLower Languedoc on the 8th of August, 1756, for the purpose of\r\nordaining to the ministry three young men who had arrived from\r\nLausanne, where they had been educated. A number of pastors were\r\npresent, and as many as from ten to twelve thousand men, women, and\r\nchildren were there from the surrounding country. The congregation was\r\nsinging a psalm, when a detachment of soldiers approached. The people\r\nsaw them; the singing ceased; the pastors urging patience and\r\nsubmission. The soldiers fired; every shot told; and the crowd fled in\r\nall directions. The meeting was thus dispersed, leaving the\r\nmurderers--in other words, the gallant soldiers--masters of the field;\r\na long track of blood remaining to mark the site on which the\r\nprayer-meeting had been held.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to recount further cruelties and tortures.\r\nAssemblies surrounded and people shot; preachers seized and hanged;\r\nmen sent to the galleys; women sent to the Tour de Constance; children\r\ncarried off to the convents--such was the horrible ministry of torture\r\nin France. When Court heard of the re-inflictions of some old form of\r\ntorture--\"Alas,\" said he, \"there is nothing new under the sun. In all\r\ntimes, the storm of persecution has cleansed the threshing-floor of\r\nthe Lord.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, notwithstanding all the bitterness of the persecution, the\r\nnumber of Protestants increased. It is difficult to determine their\r\nnumbers. Their apologists said they amounted to three millions;[69]\r\ntheir detractors that they did not amount to four hundred thousand.\r\nThe number of itinerant pastors, however, steadily grew. In 1756 there\r\nwere 48 pastors at work, with 22 probationary preachers and students.\r\nIn 1763 there were 62 pastors, 35 preachers, and 15 students.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 69: Ripert de Monclar, procureur-général, writing\r\n         in 1755, says: \"According to the jurisprudence of this\r\n         kingdom, there are no French Protestants, and yet, according\r\n         to the truth of facts, there are three millions. These\r\n         imaginary beings fill the towns, provinces, and rural\r\n         districts, and the capital alone contains sixty thousand of\r\n         them.\"]\r\n\r\nThen followed the death of Antoine Court himself in Switzerland--after\r\nwatching over the education and training of preachers at the Lausanne\r\nSeminary. Feeling his powers beginning to fail, he had left Lausanne,\r\nand resided at Timonex. There, assisted by his son Court de Gébelin,\r\nProfessor of Logic at the College, he conducted an immense\r\ncorrespondence with French Protestants at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nCourt's wife died in 1755, to his irreparable loss. His \"Rachel,\"\r\nduring his many years of peril, had been his constant friend and\r\nconsoler. Unable, after her death, to live at Timonex, so full of\r\ncruel recollections, Court returned to Lausanne. He did not long\r\nsurvive his wife's death. While engaged in writing the history of the\r\nReformed Church of France, he was taken ill. His history of the\r\nCamisards was sent to press, and he lived to revise the first\r\nproof-sheets. But he did not survive to see the book published. He\r\ndied on the 15th June, 1760, in the sixty-fourth year of his age.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Court's death--indeed from the time that Court left\r\nFrance to settle at Lausanne--Paul Rabaut continued to be looked upon\r\nas the leader and director of the proscribed Huguenot Church. Rabaut\r\noriginally belonged to Bedarieux in Languedoc. He was a great friend\r\nof Pradel's. Rabaut served the Church at Nismes, and Pradel at Uzes.\r\nBoth spent two years at Lausanne in 1744-5. Court entertained the\r\nhighest affection for Rabaut, and regarded him as his successor. And\r\nindeed he nobly continued the work which Court had begun.\r\n\r\nBesides being zealous, studious, and pious, Rabaut was firm, active,\r\nshrewd, and gentle. He stood strongly upon moral force. Once, when the\r\nHuguenots had become more than usually provoked by the persecutions\r\npractised on them, they determined to appear armed at the assemblies.\r\nRabaut peremptorily forbade it. If they persevered, he would forsake\r\ntheir meetings. He prevailed, and they came armed only with their\r\nBibles.\r\n\r\nThe directness of Rabaut's character, the nobility of his sentiments,\r\nthe austerity of his life, and his heroic courage, evidently destined\r\nhim as the head of the work which Court had begun. Antoine Court! Paul\r\nRabaut! The one restored Protestantism in France, the other rooted and\r\nestablished it.\r\n\r\nRabaut's enthusiasm may be gathered from the following extract of a\r\nletter which he wrote to a friend at Geneva: \"When I fix my attention\r\nupon the divine fire with which, I will not say Jesus Christ and the\r\nApostles, but the Reformed and their immediate successors, burned for\r\nthe salvation of souls, it seems to me that, in comparison with them,\r\nwe are ice. Their immense works astound me, and at the same time cover\r\nme with confusion. What would I not give to resemble them in\r\neverything laudable!\"\r\n\r\nRabaut had the same privations, perils, and difficulties to undergo as\r\nthe rest of the pastors in the Desert. He had to assume all sorts of\r\nnames and disguises while he travelled through the country, in order\r\nto preach at the appointed places. He went by the names of M. Paul, M.\r\nDenis, M. Pastourel, and M. Theophile; and he travelled under the\r\ndisguises of a common labourer, a trader, a journeyman, and a baker.\r\n\r\nHe was condemned to death, as a pastor who preached in defiance of the\r\nlaw; but his disguises were so well prepared, and the people for whom\r\nhe ministered were so faithful to him, that the priests and other\r\nspies never succeeded in apprehending him. Singularly enough, he was\r\nin all other respects in favour of the recognition of legal authority,\r\nand strongly urged his brethren never to adopt any means whatever of\r\nforcibly resisting the King's orders.\r\n\r\nMany of the military commanders were becoming disgusted with the\r\ndespicable and cowardly business which the priests called upon them to\r\ndo. Thus, on one occasion, a number of Protestants had assembled at\r\nthe house of Paul Rabaut at Nismes, and, while they were on their\r\nknees, the door was suddenly burst open, when a man, muffled up,\r\npresented himself, and throwing open his cloak, discovered the\r\nmilitary commandant of the town. \"My friends,\" he said, \"you have Paul\r\nRabaut with you; in a quarter of an hour I shall be here with my\r\nsoldiers, accompanied by Father ----, who has just laid the\r\ninformation against you.\" When the soldiers arrived, headed by the\r\ncommandant and the father, of course no Paul Rabaut was to be found.\r\n\r\n\"For more than thirty years,\" says one of Paul Rabaut's biographers,\r\n\"caverns and huts, whence he was unearthed like a wild animal, were\r\nhis only habitation. For a long time he dwelt in a safe hiding-place\r\nthat one of his faithful guides had provided for him, under a pile of\r\nstones and thorn-bushes. It was discovered at length by a shepherd,\r\nand such was the wretchedness of his condition, that, when he was\r\nforced to abandon the place, he still regretted this retreat, which\r\nwas more fit for savage beasts than men.\"\r\n\r\nYet this hut of piled stones was for some time the centre of\r\nProtestant affairs in France. All the faithful instinctively turned to\r\nRabaut when assailed by fresh difficulties and persecutions, and acted\r\non his advice. He obtained the respect even of the Catholics\r\nthemselves, because it was known that he was a friend of peace, and\r\nopposed to all risings and rebellions amongst his people.\r\n\r\nOnce he had the courage to present a petition to the Marquis de\r\nPaulmy, Minister of War, when changing horses at a post-house between\r\nNismes and Montpellier. Rabaut introduced himself by name, and the\r\nMarquis knew that it was the proscribed pastor who stood before him.\r\nHe might have arrested and hanged Rabaut on the spot; but, impressed\r\nby the noble bearing of the pastor, he accepted the petition, and\r\npromised to lay it before the king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nEND OF THE PERSECUTIONS--THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1762, the execution of an unknown Protestant at Toulouse\r\nmade an extraordinary noise in Europe. Protestant pastors had so often\r\nbeen executed, that the punishment had ceased to be a novelty.\r\nSometimes they were simply hanged; at other times they were racked,\r\nand then hanged; and lastly, they were racked, had their larger bones\r\nbroken, and were then hanged. Yet none of the various tortures\r\npractised on the Protestant pastors had up to that time excited any\r\nparticular sensation in France itself, and still less in Europe.\r\n\r\nCruelty against French Huguenots was so common a thing in those days,\r\nthat few persons who were of any other religion, or of no religion at\r\nall, cured anything about it. The Protestants were altogether outside\r\nthe law. When a Protestant meeting was discovered and surrounded, and\r\nmen, women, and children were at once shot down, no one could call the\r\nmurderers in question, because the meetings were illegal. The persons\r\ntaken prisoners at the meetings were brought before the magistrates\r\nand sentenced to punishments even worse than death. They might be sent\r\nto the galleys, to spend the remainder of their lives amongst\r\nthieves, murderers, and assassins. Women and children found at such\r\nmeetings might also be sentenced to be imprisoned in the Tour de\r\nConstance. There were even cases of boys of twelve years old having\r\nbeen sent to the galleys for life, because of having accompanied their\r\nparents to \"the Preaching.\"[70]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 70: Athanase Coquerel, \"Les Forçats pour la Foi,\"\r\n         91.]\r\n\r\nThe same cruelties were at that time practised upon the common people\r\ngenerally, whether they were Huguenots or not. The poor creatures,\r\nwhose only pleasure consisted in sometimes hunting a Protestant, were\r\nso badly off in some districts of France that they even fed upon\r\ngrass. The most distressed districts in France were those in which the\r\nbishops and clergy were the principal owners of land. They were the\r\nlast to abandon slavery, which continued upon their estates until\r\nafter the Revolution.\r\n\r\nAll these abominations had grown up in France, because the people had\r\nbegun to lose the sense of individual liberty. Louis XIV. had in his\r\ntime prohibited the people from being of any religion different from\r\nhis own. \"His Majesty,\" said his Prime Minister Louvois, \"will not\r\nsuffer any person to remain in his kingdom who shall not be of his\r\nreligion.\" And Louis XV. continued the delusion. The whole of the\r\ntyrannical edicts and ordinances of Louis XIV. continued to be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nIt was not that Louis XIV. and Louis XV. were kings of any virtue or\r\nreligion. Both were men of exceedingly immoral habits. We have\r\nelsewhere described Louis XIV., but Louis XV., the Well-beloved, was\r\nperhaps the greatest profligate of the two. Madame de Pompadour, when\r\nshe ceased to be his mistress, became his procuress. This infamous\r\nwoman had the command of the state purse, and she contrived to build\r\nfor the sovereign a harem, called the Parc-aux-Cerfs, in the park of\r\nVersailles, which cost the country at least a hundred millions of\r\nfrancs.[71] The number of young girls taken from Paris to this place\r\nexcited great public discontent; and though morals generally were not\r\nvery high at that time, the debauchery and intemperance of the King\r\n(for he was almost constantly drunk)[72] contributed to alienate the\r\nnation, and to foster those feelings of hatred which broke forth\r\nwithout restraint in the ensuing reign.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 71: \"Madame de Pompadour découvrit que Louis XV.\r\n         pourrait lui-même s'amuser à faire l'éducation de ces jeunes\r\n         malheureuses. De petites filles de neuf à douze ans,\r\n         lorsqu'elles avaient attiré les regards de la police par leur\r\n         beauté, étaient enlevées à leurs mères par plusieurs\r\n         artifices, conduites à Versailles, et retenues dans les\r\n         parties les plus élevées et les plus inaccessibles des petits\r\n         appartements du roi.... Le nombre des malheureuses qui\r\n         passèrent successivement à Parc-aux-Cerfs est immense; à leur\r\n         sortie elles étaient mariées à des hommes vils ou crédules\r\n         auxquels elles apportaient une bonne dot. Quelques unes\r\n         conservaient un traitement fort considerable.\" \"Les dépenses\r\n         du Parc-aux-Cerfs, dit Lacratelle, se payaient avec des\r\n         acquits du comptant. Il est difficile de les évaluer; mais il\r\n         ne peut y avoir aucune exagération à affirmer qu'elles\r\n         coûtèrent plus de 100 millions à l'État. Dans quelques\r\n         libelles on les porte jusqu'à un milliard.\"--SISMONDI,\r\n         _Histoire de Française_, Brussels, 1844, xx. 153-4. The\r\n         account given by Sismondi of the debauches of this persecutor\r\n         of the Huguenots is very full. It is _not_ given in the \"Old\r\n         Court Life of France,\" recently written by a lady.]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 72: Sismondi, xx. 157.]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this public disregard for virtue, a spirit of\r\nribaldry and disregard for the sanctions of religion had long been\r\nmaking its appearance in the literature of the time. The highest\r\nspeculations which can occupy the attention of man were touched with a\r\nrecklessness and power, a brilliancy of touch and a bitterness of\r\nsatire, which forced the sceptical productions of the day upon the\r\nnotice of all who studied, read, or delighted in literature;--for\r\nthose were the days of Voltaire, Rousseau, Condorcet, and the great\r\nmen of \"The Encyclopædia.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the King indulged in his vicious pleasures, and went reeking\r\nfrom his debaucheries to obtain absolution from his confessors, the\r\npersecution of the Protestants went on as before. Nor was it until\r\npublic opinion (such as it was) was brought to bear upon the hideous\r\nincongruity that religious persecutions were at once brought summarily\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\nThe last executions of Huguenots in France because of their\r\nProtestantism occurred in 1762. Francis Rochette, a young pastor,\r\ntwenty-six years old, was laid up by sickness at Montauban. He\r\nrecovered sufficiently to proceed to the waters of St. Antonin for the\r\nrecovery of his health, when he was seized, together with his two\r\nguides or bearers, by the burgess guard of the town of Caussade. The\r\nthree brothers Grenier endeavoured to intercede for them; but the\r\nmayor of Caussade, proud of his capture, sent the whole of the\r\nprisoners to gaol.\r\n\r\nThey were tried by the judges of Toulouse on the 18th of February.\r\nRochette was condemned to be hung in his shirt, his head and feet\r\nuncovered, with a paper pinned on his shirt before and behind, with\r\nthe words written thereon--\"_Ministre de la religion prétendue\r\nréformée._\" The three brothers Grenier, who interfered on behalf of\r\nRochette, were ordered to have their heads taken off for resisting the\r\nsecular power; and the two guides, who were bearing the sick Rochette\r\nto St. Antonin for the benefit of the waters, were sent to the galleys\r\nfor life.\r\n\r\nBarbarous punishments such as these were so common when Protestants\r\nwere the offenders, that the decision, of the judges did not excite\r\nany particular sensation. It was only when Jean Calas was shortly\r\nafter executed at Toulouse that an extraordinary sensation was\r\nproduced--and that not because Calas was a Protestant, but because his\r\npunishment came under the notice of Voltaire, who exposed the inhuman\r\ncruelty to France, Europe, and the world at large.\r\n\r\nThe reason why Protestant executions terminated with the death of\r\nCalas was as follows:--The family of Jean Calas resided at Toulouse,\r\nthen one of the most bigoted cities in France. Toulouse swarmed with\r\npriests and monks, more Spanish than French in their leanings. They\r\nwere great in relics, processions, and confraternities. While\r\n\"mealy-mouthed\" Catholics in other quarters were becoming somewhat\r\nashamed of the murders perpetrated during the Massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew, and were even disposed to deny them, the more outspoken\r\nCatholics of Toulouse were even proud of the feat, and publicly\r\ncelebrated the great southern Massacre of St. Bartholomew which took\r\nplace in 1572. The procession then held was one of the finest church\r\ncommemorations in the south; it was followed by bishops, clergy, and\r\nthe people of the neighbourhood, in immense numbers.\r\n\r\nCalas was an old man of sixty-four, and reduced to great weakness by a\r\nparalytic complaint. He and his family were all Protestants excepting\r\none son, who had become a Catholic. Another of the sons, however, a\r\nman of ill-regulated life, dissolute, and involved in pecuniary\r\ndifficulties, committed suicide by hanging himself in an outhouse.\r\n\r\nOn this, the brotherhood of White Penitents stirred up a great fury\r\nagainst the Protestant family in the minds of the populace. The monks\r\nalleged that Jean Calas had murdered his son because he wished to\r\nbecome a Catholic. They gave out that it was a practice of the\r\nProtestants to keep an executioner to murder their children who wished\r\nto abjure the reformed faith, and that one of the objects of the\r\nmeetings which they held in the Desert, was to elect this executioner.\r\nThe White Penitents celebrated mass for the suicide's soul; they\r\nexhibited his figure with a palm branch in his hand, and treated him\r\nas a martyr.\r\n\r\nThe public mind became inflamed. A fanatical judge, called David, took\r\nup the case, and ordered Calas and his whole family to be sent to\r\nprison. Calas was tried by the court of Toulouse. They tortured the\r\nwhole family to compel them to confess the murder;[73] but they did\r\nnot confess. The court wished to burn the mother, but they ended by\r\ncondemning the paralytic father to be broken alive on the wheel.[74]\r\nThe parliament of Toulouse confirmed the atrocious sentence, and the\r\nold man perished in torments, declaring to the last his entire\r\ninnocence. The rest of the family were discharged, although if there\r\nhad been any truth in the charge for which Jean Calas was racked to\r\ndeath, they must necessarily have been his accomplices, and equally\r\nliable to punishment.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 73: Sismondi, xx. 328.]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 74: To be broken alive on the wheel was one of the\r\n         most horrible of tortures, a bequest from ages of violence\r\n         and barbarism. It was preserved in France mainly for the\r\n         punishment of Protestants. The prisoner was extended on a St.\r\n         Andrew's cross, with eight notches cut on it--one below each\r\n         arm between the elbow and wrist, another between each elbow\r\n         and the shoulders, one under each thigh, and one under each\r\n         leg. The executioner, armed with a heavy triangular bar of\r\n         iron, gave a heavy blow on each of these eight places, and\r\n         broke the bone. Another blow was given in the pit of the\r\n         stomach. The mangled victim was lifted from the cross and\r\n         stretched on a small wheel placed vertically at one of the\r\n         ends of the cross, his back on the upper part of the wheel,\r\n         his head and feet hanging down. There the tortured creature\r\n         hung until he died. Some lingered five or six hours, others\r\n         much longer. This horrible method of torture was only\r\n         abolished at the French Revolution in 1790.]\r\n\r\nThe ruined family left Toulouse and made for Geneva, then the\r\nhead-quarters of Protestants from the South of France. And here it was\r\nthat the murder of Jean Calas and the misfortunes of the Calas family\r\ncame under the notice of Voltaire, then living at Ferney, near Geneva.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the persecutions of the Protestants a great many\r\nchanges had been going on in France. Although the clergy had for more\r\nthan a century the sole control of the religious education of the\r\npeople, the people had not become religious. They had become very\r\nignorant and very fanatical. The upper classes were anything but\r\nreligious; they were given up for the most part to frivolity and\r\nlibertinage. The examples of their kings had been freely followed.\r\nThough ready to do honour to the court religion, the higher classes\r\ndid not believe in it. The press was very free for the publication of\r\nlicentious and immoral books, but not for Protestant Bibles. A great\r\nwork was, however, in course of publication, under the editorship of\r\nD'Alembert and Diderot, to which Voltaire, Rousseau, and others\r\ncontributed, entitled \"The Encyclopædia.\" It was a description of the\r\nentire circle of human knowledge; but the dominant idea which pervaded\r\nit was the utter subversion of religion.\r\n\r\nThe abuses of the Church, its tyranny and cruelty, the ignorance and\r\nhelplessness in which it kept the people, the frivolity and unbelief\r\nof the clergy themselves, had already condemned it in the minds of the\r\nnation. The writers in \"The Encyclopædia\" merely gave expression to\r\ntheir views, and the publication of its successive numbers was\r\nreceived with rapture. In the midst of the free publication of\r\nobscene books, there had also appeared, before the execution of Calas,\r\nthe Marquis de Mirabeau's \"Ami des Hommes,\" Rousseau's \"Émile,\" the\r\n\"Contrat Social,\" with other works, denying religion of all kinds, and\r\npointing to the general downfall, which was now fast approaching.\r\n\r\nWhen the Calas family took refuge in Geneva, Voltaire soon heard of\r\ntheir story. It was communicated to him by M. de Végobre, a French\r\nrefugee. After he had related it, Voltaire said, \"This is a horrible\r\nstory. What has become of the family?\" \"They arrived in Geneva only\r\nthree days ago.\" \"In Geneva!\" said Voltaire; \"then let me see them at\r\nonce.\" Madame Calas soon arrived, told him the whole facts of the\r\ncase, and convinced Voltaire of the entire innocence of the family.\r\n\r\nVoltaire was no friend of the Huguenots. He believed the Huguenot\r\nspirit to be a republican spirit. In his \"Siècle de Louis XIV.,\" when\r\ntreating of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, he affirmed that\r\nthe Reformed were the enemies of the State; and though he depicted\r\nfeelingly the cruelties they had suffered, he also stated clearly that\r\nhe thought they had deserved them. Voltaire probably owed his hatred\r\nof the Protestants to the Jesuits, by whom he was educated. He was\r\nbrought up at the Jesuit College of Louis le Grand, the chief\r\npersecutor of the Huguenots. Voltaire also owed much of the looseness\r\nof his principles to his godfather, the Abbé Chateauneuf, grand-prior\r\nof Vendôme, the Abbé de Chalieu, and others, who educated him in an\r\nutter contempt for the doctrines they were appointed and paid to\r\nteach. It was when but a mere youth that Father Lejay, one of\r\nVoltaire's instructors, predicted that he would yet be the Coryphæus\r\nof Deism in France.\r\n\r\nNor was Voltaire better pleased with the Swiss Calvinists. He\r\nencountered some of the most pedantic of them while residing at\r\nLausanne and Geneva.[75] At the latter place, he covered with sarcasm\r\nthe \"twenty-four periwigs\"--the Protestant council of the city. They\r\nwould not allow him to set up a theatre in Geneva, so he determined to\r\nset up one himself at La Chatelaine, about a mile off, but beyond the\r\nGenevese frontier. His object, he professed, was \"to corrupt the\r\npedantic city.\" The theatre is still standing, though it is now used\r\nonly as a hayloft. The box is preserved from which Voltaire cheered\r\nthe performance of his own and other plays.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 75: While Voltaire lived at Lausanne, one of the\r\n         baillies (the chief magistrates of the city) said to him:\r\n         \"Monsieur de Voltaire, they say that you have written against\r\n         the good God: it is very wrong, but I hope He will pardon\r\n         you.... But, Monsieur de Voltaire, take very good care not to\r\n         write against their excellencies of Berne, our sovereign\r\n         lords, for be assured that they will _never_ forgive you.\"]\r\n\r\nBut though Voltaire hated Protestantism like every other religion, he\r\nalso hated injustice. It was because of this that he took up the case\r\nof the Calas family, so soon as he had become satisfied of their\r\ninnocence. But what a difficulty he had to encounter in endeavouring\r\nto upset the decision of the judges, and the condemnation of Calas by\r\nthe parliament of Toulouse. Moreover, he had to reverse their decision\r\nagainst a dead man, and that man a detested Huguenot.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Voltaire took up the case. He wrote letters to his\r\nfriends in all parts of France. He wrote to the sovereigns of Europe.\r\nHe published letters in the newspapers. He addressed the Duke de\r\nChoiseul, the King's Secretary of State. He appealed to philosophers,\r\nto men of letters, to ladies of the court, and even to priests and\r\nbishops, denouncing the sentence pronounced against Calas,--the most\r\niniquitous, he said, that any court professing to act in the name of\r\njustice had ever pronounced. Ferney was visited by many foreigners,\r\nfrom Germany, America, England, and Russia; as well as by numerous\r\npersons of influence in France. To all these he spoke vehemently of\r\nCalas and his sentence. He gave himself no rest until he had inflamed\r\nthe minds of all men against the horrible injustice.\r\n\r\nAt length, the case of Calas became known all over France, and in fact\r\nall over Europe. The press of Paris rang with it. In the boudoirs and\r\nsalons, Calas was the subject of conversation. In the streets, men\r\nmeeting each other would ask, \"Have you heard of Calas?\" The dead man\r\nhad already become a hero and a martyr!\r\n\r\nAn important point was next reached. It was decided that the case of\r\nCalas should be remitted to a special court of judges appointed to\r\nconsider the whole matter. Voltaire himself proceeded to get up the\r\ncase. He prepared and revised the memorials, he revised all the\r\npleadings of the advocates, transforming them into brief, conclusive\r\narguments, sparkling with wit, reason, and eloquence. The revision of\r\nthe process commenced. The people held their breaths while it\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\nAt length, in the spring of 1766--four years after Calas had been\r\nbroken to death on the wheel--four years after Voltaire had undertaken\r\nto have the unjust decision of the Toulouse magistrates and parliament\r\nreversed, the court of judges, after going completely over the\r\nevidence, pronounced the judgment to have been entirely unfounded!\r\n\r\nThe decree was accordingly reversed. Jean Calas was declared to have\r\nbeen innocent. The man was, however, dead. But in order to compensate\r\nhis family, the ministry granted 36,000 francs to Calas's widow, on\r\nthe express recommendation of the court which reversed the abominable\r\nsentence.[76]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 76: It may be added that, after the reversal of the\r\n         sentence, David, the judge who had first condemned Calas,\r\n         went insane, and died in a madhouse.]\r\n\r\nThe French people never forgot Voltaire's efforts in this cause.\r\nNotwithstanding all his offences against morals and religion, Voltaire\r\non this occasion acted on his best impulses. Many years after, in\r\n1778, he visited Paris, where he was received with immense enthusiasm.\r\nHe was followed in the streets wherever he went. One day when passing\r\nalong the Pont Royal, some person asked, \"Who is that man the crowd is\r\nfollowing?\" \"Ne savez vous pas,\" answered a common woman, \"que c'est\r\nle sauveur de Calas!\" Voltaire was more touched with this simple\r\ntribute to his fame than with all the adoration of the Parisians.\r\n\r\nIt was soon found, however, that there were many persons still\r\nsuffering in France from the cruelty of priests and judges; and one of\r\nthese occurred shortly after the death of Calas. One of the ordinary\r\npractices of the Catholics was to seize the children of Protestants\r\nand carry them off to some nunnery to be educated at the expense of\r\ntheir parents. The priests of Toulouse had obtained a _lettre de\r\ncachet_ to take away the daughter of a Protestant named Sirven, to\r\ncompel her to change her religion. She was accordingly seized and\r\ncarried off to a nunnery. She manifested such reluctance to embrace\r\nCatholicism, and she was treated with such cruelty, that she fled from\r\nthe convent in the night, and fell into a well, where she was found\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\nThe prejudices of the Catholic bigots being very much excited about\r\nthis time by the case of Calas, blamed the family of Sirven (in the\r\nsame manner as they had done that of Calas) with murdering their\r\ndaughter. Foreseeing that they would be apprehended if they remained,\r\nthe whole family left the city, and set out for Geneva. After they\r\nleft, Sirven was in fact sentenced to death _par contumace_. It was\r\nabout the middle of winter when they set out, and Sirven's wife died\r\nof cold on the way, amidst the snows of the Jura.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at Geneva, Sirven stated his case to Voltaire, who took\r\nit up as he had done that of Calas. He exerted himself as before.\r\nAdvocates of the highest rank offered to conduct Sirven's case; for\r\npublic opinion had already made considerable progress. Sirven was\r\nadvised to return to Toulouse, and offer himself as a prisoner. He did\r\nso. The case was tried with the same results as before; the advocates,\r\nacting under Voltaire's instructions and with his help, succeeded in\r\nobtaining the judges' unanimous decision that Sirven was innocent of\r\nthe crime for which he had already been sentenced to death.\r\n\r\nAfter this, there were no further executions of Protestants in France.\r\nBut what became of the Huguenots at the galleys, who still continued\r\nto endure a punishment from day to day, even worse than death\r\nitself?[77] Although, they were often cut off by fever, starvation,\r\nand exposure, many of them contrived to live on to a considerable age.\r\nAfter the trials of Calas and Sirven, the punishment of the galleys\r\nwas evidently drawing to an end. Only two persons were sent to the\r\ngalleys during the year in which Pastor Rochette was hanged. But a\r\ncircumstance came to light respecting one of the galley-slaves who had\r\nbeen liberated in that very year (1762), which had the effect of\r\neventually putting an end to the cruelty.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 77: The Huguenots sometimes owed their release from\r\n         the galleys to money payments made by Protestants (but this\r\n         was done secretly), the price of a galley-slave being about a\r\n         thousand crowns; sometimes they owed it to the influence of\r\n         Protestant princes; but never to the voluntary mercy of the\r\n         Catholics. In 1742, while France was at war with England, and\r\n         Prussia was quietly looking on, Antoine Court made an appeal\r\n         to Frederick the Great, and at his intervention with Louis\r\n         XV. thirty galley-slaves were liberated. The Margrave of\r\n         Bayreuth, Culmbach and his wife, the sister of the Great\r\n         Frederick, afterwards visited the galleys at Toulon, and\r\n         succeeded in obtaining the liberation of several\r\n         galley-slaves.]\r\n\r\nThe punishment was not, however, abolished by Christian feeling, or by\r\ngreater humanity on the part of the Catholics; nor was it abolished\r\nthrough the ministers of justice, and still less by the order of the\r\nKing. It was put an end to by the Stage! As Voltaire, the Deist,\r\nterminated the hanging of Protestants, so did Fenouillot, the player,\r\nput an end to their serving as galley-slaves. The termination of this\r\nlatter punishment has a curious history attached to it.\r\n\r\nIt happened that a Huguenot meeting for worship was held in the\r\nneighbourhood of Nismes, on the first day of January, 1756. The place\r\nof meeting was called the Lecque,[78] situated immediately north of\r\nthe Tour Magne, from which the greater part of the city has been\r\nbuilt. It was a favourable place for holding meetings; but it was not\r\nso favourable for those who wished to escape. The assembly had\r\nscarcely been constituted by prayer, when the alarm was given that the\r\nsoldiers were upon them! The people fled on all sides. The youngest\r\nand most agile made their escape by climbing the surrounding rocks.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 78: This secret meeting-place of the Huguenots is\r\n         well known from the engraved picture of Boze.]\r\n\r\nAmongst these, Jean Fabre, a young silk merchant of Nismes, was\r\nalready beyond reach of danger, when he heard that his father had been\r\nmade a prisoner. The old man, who was seventy-eight, could not climb\r\nas the others had done, and the soldiers had taken him and were\r\nleading him away. The son, who knew that his father would be sentenced\r\nto the galleys for life, immediately determined, if possible, to\r\nrescue him from this horrible fate. He returned to the group of\r\nsoldiers who had his father in charge, and asked them to take him\r\nprisoner in his place. On their refusal, he seized his father and drew\r\nhim from their grasp, insisting upon them taking himself instead. The\r\nsergeant in command at first refused to adopt this strange\r\nsubstitution; but, conquered at last by the tears and prayers of the\r\nson, he liberated the aged man and accepted Jean Fabre as his\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nJean Fabre was first imprisoned at Nismes, where he was prevented\r\nseeing any of his friends, including a certain young lady to whom he\r\nwas about shortly to be married. He was then transferred to\r\nMontpellier to be judged; where, of course, he was condemned, as he\r\nexpected, to be sent to the galleys for life. With this dreadful\r\nprospect before him, of separation from all that he loved--from his\r\nfather, for whom he was about to suffer so much; from his betrothed,\r\nwho gave up all hope of ever seeing him again--and having no prospect\r\nof being relieved from his horrible destiny, his spirits failed, and\r\nhe became seriously ill. But his youth and Christian resignation came\r\nto his aid, and he finally recovered.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants of Nismes, and indeed of all Languedoc, were greatly\r\nmoved by the fate of Jean Fabre. The heroism of his devotion to his\r\nparent soon became known, and the name of the volunteer convict was\r\nin every mouth. The Duc de Mirepoix, then governor of the province,\r\nendeavoured to turn the popular feeling to some account. He offered\r\npardon to Fabre and Turgis (who had been taken prisoner with him)\r\nprovided Paul Rabaut, the chief pastor of the Desert, a hard-working\r\nand indefatigable man, would leave France and reside abroad. But\r\nneither Fabre, nor Rabaut, nor the Huguenots generally, had any\r\nconfidence in the mercy of the Catholics, and the proposal was coldly\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nFabre was next sent to Toulon under a strong escort of cavalry. He was\r\nthere registered in the class of convicts; his hair was cut close; he\r\nwas clothed in the ignominious dress of the galley-slave, and placed\r\nin a galley among murderers and criminals, where he was chained to one\r\nof the worst. The dinner consisted of a porridge of cooked beans and\r\nblack bread. At first he could not touch it, and preferred to suffer\r\nhunger. A friend of Fabre, who was informed of his starvation, sent\r\nhim some food more savoury and digestible; but his stomach was in such\r\na state that he could not eat even that. At length he became\r\naccustomed to the situation, though the place was a sort of hell, in\r\nwhich he was surrounded by criminals in rags, dirt, and vermin, and,\r\nworst of all, distinguished for their abominable vileness of speech.\r\nHe was shortly after seized with a serious illness, when he was sent\r\nto the hospital, where he found many Huguenot convicts imprisoned,\r\nlike himself, because of their religion.[79]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 79: Letter of Jean Fabre, in Athanase Coquerel's\r\n         \"Forçats pour la Foi,\" 201-3.]\r\n\r\nRepeated applications were made to Saint-Florentin, the Secretary of\r\nState, by Fabre's relatives, friends, and fellow Protestants for his\r\nliberation, but without result. After he had been imprisoned for some\r\nyears, a circumstance happened which more than anything else\r\nexasperated his sufferings. The young lady to whom he was engaged had\r\nan offer of marriage made to her by a desirable person, which her\r\nfriends were anxious that she should accept. Her father had been\r\nstruck by paralysis, and was poor and unable to maintain himself as\r\nwell as his daughter. He urged that she should give up Fabre, now\r\nhopelessly imprisoned for life, and accept her new lover.\r\n\r\nFabre himself was consulted on the subject; his conscience was\r\nappealed to, and how did he decide? It was only after the bitterest\r\nstruggle, that he determined on liberating his betrothed. He saw no\r\nprospect of his release, and why should he sacrifice her? Let her no\r\nlonger be bound up with his fearful fate, but be happy with another if\r\nshe could.\r\n\r\nThe young lady yielded, though not without great misgivings. The day\r\nfor her marriage with her new lover was fixed; but, at the last\r\nmoment, she relented. Her faithfulness and love for the heroic\r\ngalley-slave had never been shaken, and she resolved to remain\r\nconstant to him, to remain unmarried if need be, or to wait for his\r\nliberation until death!\r\n\r\nIt is probable that her noble decision determined Fabre and Fabre's\r\nfriends to make a renewed effort for his liberation. At last, after\r\nhaving been more than six years a galley-slave, he bethought him of a\r\nmethod of obtaining at least a temporary liberty. He proposed--without\r\nappealing to Saint-Florentin, who was the bitter enemy of the\r\nProtestants--to get his case made known to the Duc de Choiseul,\r\nMinister of Marine. This nobleman was a just man, and it had been in a\r\ngreat measure through his influence that the judgment of Calas had\r\nbeen reconsidered and reversed.\r\n\r\nFabre, while on the rowers' bench, had often met with a M. Johannot, a\r\nFrench Protestant, settled at Frankfort-on-Maine, to whom he stated\r\nhis case. It may be mentioned that Huguenot refugees, on their visits\r\nto France, often visited the Protestant prisoners at the galleys,\r\nrelieved their wants, and made intercession for them with the outside\r\nworld. It may also be incidentally mentioned that this M. Johannot was\r\nthe ancestor of two well-known painters and designers, Alfred and\r\nTony, who have been the illustrators of some of our finest artistic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nJohannot made the case of Fabre known to some French officers whom he\r\nmet at Frankfort, interested them greatly in his noble character and\r\nself-sacrifice, and the result was that before long Fabre obtained,\r\ndirectly from the Duc de Choiseul, leave of absence from the position\r\nof galley-slave. The annoyance of Saint-Florentin, Minister of State,\r\nwas so well-known, that Fabre, on his liberation, was induced to\r\nconceal himself. Nor could he yet marry his promised wife, as he had\r\nnot been discharged, but was only on leave of absence; and\r\nSaint-Florentin obstinately refused to reverse the sentence that had\r\nbeen pronounced against him.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Fabre's name was becoming celebrated. He had no idea,\r\nwhile privately settled at Ganges as a silk stocking maker, that great\r\npeople in France were interesting themselves about his fate. The\r\nDuchesse de Grammont, sister of the Duc de Choiseul, had heard about\r\nhim from her brother; and the Prince de Beauvau, governor of\r\nLanguedoc, the Duchesse de Villeroy, and many other distinguished\r\npersonages, were celebrating his heroism.\r\n\r\nInquiry was made of the sergeant who had originally apprehended Fabre,\r\nupon his offering himself in exchange for his father (long since\r\ndead), and the sergeant confirmed the truth of the noble and generous\r\nact. At the same time, M. Alison, first consul at Nismes, confirmed\r\nthe statement by three witnesses, in presence of the secretary of the\r\nPrince de Beauvau. The result was, that Jean Fabre was completely\r\nexonerated from the charge on account of which he had been sent to the\r\ngalleys. He was now a free man, and at last married the young lady who\r\nhad loved him so long and so devotedly.\r\n\r\nOne day, to his extreme surprise, Fabre received from the Duc de\r\nChoiseul a packet containing a drama, in which he found his own\r\nhistory related in verse, by Fenouillot de Falbaire. It was entitled\r\n\"The Honest Criminal.\" Fabre had never been a criminal, except in\r\nworshipping God according to his conscience, though that had for\r\nnearly a hundred years been pronounced a crime by the law of France.\r\n\r\nThe piece, which was of no great merit as a tragedy, was at first\r\nplayed before the Duchesse de Villeroy and her friends, with great\r\napplause, Mdlle. Clairon playing the principal female part.\r\nSaint-Florentin prohibited the playing of the piece in public,\r\nprotesting to the last against the work and the author. Voltaire\r\nplayed it at Ferney, and Queen Marie Antoinette had it played in her\r\npresence at Versailles. It was not until 1789 that the piece was\r\nplayed in the theatres of Paris, when it had a considerable success.\r\n\r\nWe do not find that any Protestants were sent to be galley-slaves\r\nafter 1762, the year that Calas was executed. A reaction against this\r\nbarbarous method of treating men for differences of opinion seems to\r\nhave set in; or, perhaps, it was because most men were ceasing to\r\nbelieve in the miraculous powers of the priests, for which the\r\nProtestants had so long been hanged and made galley-slaves.\r\n\r\nAfter the liberation of Fabre in 1762, other galley-slaves were\r\nliberated from time to time. Thus, in the same year, Jean Albiges and\r\nJean Barran were liberated after eight years of convict life. They had\r\nbeen condemned for assisting at Protestant assemblies. Next year,\r\nMaurice was liberated; he had been condemned for life for the same\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nWhile Voltaire had been engaged in the case of Calas he asked the Duc\r\nde Choiseul for the liberation of a galley-slave. The man for whom he\r\ninterceded, had been a convict twenty years for attending a Protestant\r\nmeeting. Of course, Voltaire cared nothing for his religion, believing\r\nCatholicism and Protestantism to be only two forms of the same\r\nsuperstition. The name of this galley-slave was Claude Chaumont. Like\r\nnearly all the other convicts he was a working man--a little\r\ndark-faced shoemaker. Some Protestant friends he had at Geneva\r\ninterceded with Voltaire for his liberation.\r\n\r\nOn Chaumont's release in 1764, he waited upon his deliverer to thank\r\nhim. \"What!\" said Voltaire, on first seeing him, \"my poor little bit\r\nof a man, have they put _you_ in the galleys? What could they have\r\ndone with you? The idea of sending a little creature to the\r\ngalley-chain, for no other crime than that of praying to God in bad\r\nFrench!\"[80] Voltaire ended by handing the impoverished fellow a sum\r\nof money to set him up in the world again, when he left the house the\r\nhappiest of men.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 80: \"Voltaire et les Genevois,\" par J. Gaberel,\r\n         74-5.]\r\n\r\nWe may briefly mention a few of the last of the galley-slaves. Daniel\r\nBic and Jean Cabdié, liberated in 1764, for attending religious\r\nmeetings. Both were condemned for life, and had been at the\r\ngalley-chain for ten years.\r\n\r\nJean Pierre Espinas, an attorney, of St. Felix de Châteauneuf, in\r\nViverais, who had been condemned for life for having given shelter to\r\na pastor, was released in 1765, at the age of sixty-seven, after being\r\nchained at the galleys for twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nJean Raymond, of Fangères, the father of six children, who had been a\r\ngalley-slave for thirteen years, was liberated in 1767. Alexandre\r\nChambon, a labourer, more than eighty years old, condemned for life in\r\n1741, for attending a religious meeting, was released in 1769, on the\r\nentreaty of Voltaire, after being a galley-slave for twenty-eight\r\nyears. His friends had forgotten him, and on his release he was\r\nutterly destitute and miserable.[81]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 81: \"Lettres inédites des Voltaire,\" publiées par\r\n         Athanase Coquerel fils, 247.]\r\n\r\nIn 1772, three galley-slaves were liberated from their chains. André\r\nGuisard, a labourer, aged eighty-two, Jean Roque, and Louis Tregon, of\r\nthe same class, all condemned for life for attending religious\r\nmeetings. They had all been confined at the chain for twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe two last galley-slaves were liberated in 1775, during the first\r\nyear of the reign of Louis XVI., and close upon the outbreak of the\r\nFrench Revolution. They had been quite forgotten, until Court de\r\nGébelin, son of Antoine Court, discovered them. When he applied for\r\ntheir release to M. de Boyne, Minister of Marine, he answered that\r\nthere were no more Protestant convicts at the galleys; at least, he\r\nbelieved so. Shortly after, Turgot succeeded Boyne, and application\r\nwas made to him. He answered that there was no need to recommend such\r\nobjects to him for liberation, as they were liberated already.\r\n\r\nOn the two old men being told they were released, they burst into\r\ntears; but were almost afraid of returning to the world which no\r\nlonger knew them. One of them was Antoine Rialle, a tailor of Aoste,\r\nin Dauphiny, who had been condemned by the parliament of Grenoble to\r\nthe galleys for life \"for contravening the edicts of the King\r\nconcerning religion.\" He was seventy-eight years old, and had been a\r\ngalley-slave for thirty years.\r\n\r\nThe other, Paul Achard, had been a shoemaker of Châtillon, also in\r\nDauphiny. He was condemned to be a galley-slave for life by the\r\nparliament of Grenoble, for having given shelter to a pastor. Achard\r\nhad also been confined at the galleys for thirty years.\r\n\r\nIt is not known when the last Huguenot women were liberated from the\r\nTour de Constance, at Aiguesmortes. It would probably be about the\r\ntime when the last Huguenots were liberated from the galleys. An\r\naffecting picture has been left by an officer who visited the prison\r\nat the release of the last prisoners. \"I accompanied,\" he says, \"the\r\nPrince de Beauvau (the intendant of Languedoc under Louis XVI.) in a\r\nsurvey which he made of the coast. Arriving at Aiguesmortes, at the\r\ngate of the Tour de Constance, we found at the entrance the principal\r\nkeeper, who conducted us by dark steps through a great gate, which\r\nopened with an ominous noise, and over which was inscribed a motto\r\nfrom Dante--'Lasciate ogni speranza voi che'ntrate.'\r\n\r\n\"Words fail me to describe the horror with which we regarded a scene\r\nto which we were so unaccustomed--a frightful and affecting picture,\r\nin which the interest was heightened by disgust. We beheld a large\r\ncircular apartment, deprived of air and of light, in which fourteen\r\nfemales still languished in misery. It was with difficulty that the\r\nPrince smothered his emotion; and doubtless it was the first time that\r\nthese unfortunate creatures had there witnessed compassion depicted\r\nupon a human countenance; I still seem to behold the affecting\r\napparition. They fell at our feet, bathed in tears, and speechless,\r\nuntil, emboldened by our expressions of sympathy, they recounted to us\r\ntheir sufferings. Alas! all their crime consisted in having been\r\nattached to the same religion as Henry IV. The youngest of these\r\nmartyrs was more than fifty years old. She was but _eight_ when first\r\nimprisoned for having accompanied her mother to hear a religious\r\nservice, and her punishment had continued until now!\"[82]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 82: Froissard, \"Nismes et ses Environs,\" ii. 217.]\r\n\r\nAfter the liberation of the last of the galley-slaves there were no\r\nfurther apprehensions nor punishments of Protestants. The priests had\r\nlost their power; and the secular authority no longer obeyed their\r\nbehests. The nation had ceased to believe in them; in some places they\r\nwere laughed at; in others they were detested. They owed this partly\r\nto their cruelty and intolerance, partly to their luxury and\r\nself-indulgence amidst the poverty of the people, and partly to the\r\nsarcasms of the philosophers, who had become more powerful in France\r\nthan themselves. \"It is not enough,\" said Voltaire, \"that we prove\r\nintolerance to be horrible; we must also prove to the French that it\r\nis ridiculous.\"\r\n\r\nIn looking back at the sufferings of the Huguenots remaining in France\r\nsince the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes; at the purity,\r\nself-denial, honesty, and industry of their lives; at the devotion\r\nwith which they adhered to religious duty and the worship of God; we\r\ncannot fail to regard them--labourers and peasants though they\r\nwere--as amongst the truest, greatest, and worthiest heroes of their\r\nage. When society in France was falling to pieces; when its men and\r\nwomen were ceasing to believe in themselves and in each other; when\r\nthe religion of the State had become a mass of abuse, consistent only\r\nin its cruelty; when the debauchery of its kings[83] had descended\r\nthrough the aristocracy to the people, until the whole mass was\r\nbecoming thoroughly corrupt; these poor Huguenots seem to have been\r\nthe only constant and true men, the only men holding to a great idea,\r\nfor which they were willing to die--for they were always ready for\r\nmartyrdom by the rack, the gibbet, or the galleys, rather than forsake\r\nthe worship of God freely and according to conscience.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 83: Such was the dissoluteness of the manners of\r\n         the court, that no less than 500,000,000 francs of the public\r\n         debt, or £20,000,000 sterling, had been incurred for expenses\r\n         too ignominious to bear the light, or even to be named in the\r\n         public accounts. It appears from an authentic document,\r\n         quoted in Soulavie's history, that in the sixteen months\r\n         immediately preceding the death of Louis XV., Madame du Barry\r\n         (originally a courtesan,) had drawn from the royal treasury\r\n         no less than 2,450,000 francs, or equal to about £200,000 of\r\n         our present money. [\"Histoire de la Décadence de la Monarchie\r\n         Française,\" par Soulavie l'Aîné, iii. 330.] \"La corruption,\"\r\n         says Lacretelle, \"entrait dans les plus paisibles ménages,\r\n         dans les familles les plus obscures. Elle [Madame du Barri]\r\n         était savamment et longtemps combinée par ceux qui servaient\r\n         les débauches de Louis. Des émissaires étaient employées à\r\n         séduire des filles qui n'étaient point encore nubiles, à\r\n         combattre dans de jeunes femmes des principes de pudeur et de\r\n         fidélité. Amant de grade, il livrait à la prostitution\r\n         publique celles de ses sujettes qu'il avait prématurement\r\n         corrompues. Il souffrait que les enfans de ses infâmes\r\n         plaisirs partageassent la destinée obscure et dangereuse de\r\n         ceux qu'un père n'avoue point.\" LACRETELLE, _Histoire de\r\n         France pendant le xviii Siècle_, iii. 171-173.]\r\n\r\nBut their persecution was now in a great measure at an end. It is\r\ntrue the Protestants were not recognised, but they nevertheless held\r\ntheir worship openly, and were not interfered with. When Louis XVI.\r\nsucceeded to the throne in 1774, on the administration of the oath for\r\nthe extermination of heretics denounced by the Church, the Archbishop\r\nof Toulouse said to him: \"It is reserved for you to strike the final\r\nblow against Calvinism in your dominions. Command the dispersion of\r\nthe schismatic assemblies of the Protestants, exclude the sectarians,\r\nwithout distinction, from all offices of the public administration,\r\nand you will insure among your subjects the unity of the true\r\nChristian religion.\"\r\n\r\nNo attention was paid to this and similar appeals for the restoration\r\nof intolerance. On the contrary, an Edict of Toleration was issued by\r\nLouis XVI. in 1787, which, though granting a legal existence to the\r\nProtestants, nevertheless set forth that \"The Catholic, Apostolic, and\r\nRoman religion alone shall continue to enjoy the right of public\r\nworship in our realm.\"\r\n\r\nOpinion, however, moved very fast in those days. The Declaration of\r\nRights of 1789 overthrew the barriers which debarred the admission of\r\nProtestants to public offices. On the question of tolerance, Rabaut\r\nSaint-Etienne, son of Paul Rabaut, who sat in the National Assembly\r\nfor Nismes, insisted on the freedom of the Protestants to worship God\r\nafter their accustomed forms. He said he represented a constituency of\r\n360,000, of whom 120,000 were Protestants. The penal laws against the\r\nworship of the Reformed, he said, had never been formally abolished.\r\nHe claimed the rights of Frenchmen for two millions of useful\r\ncitizens. It was not toleration he asked for, _it was liberty_.\r\n\r\n\"Toleration!\" he exclaimed; \"sufferance! pardon! clemency! ideas\r\nsupremely unjust towards the Protestants, so long as it is true that\r\ndifference of religion, that difference of opinion, is not a crime!\r\nToleration! I demand that toleration should be proscribed in its turn,\r\nand deemed an iniquitous word, dealing with us as citizens worthy of\r\npity, as criminals to whom pardon is to be granted!\"[84]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 84: \"History of the Protestants of France,\" by G.\r\n         de Félice, book v. sect. i.]\r\n\r\nThe motion before the House was adopted with a modification, and all\r\nFrenchmen, without distinction of religious opinions, were declared\r\nadmissible to all offices and employments. Four months later, on the\r\n15th March, 1790, Rabaut Saint-Etienne himself, son of the long\r\nproscribed pastor of the Desert, was nominated President of the\r\nConstituent Assembly, succeeding to the chair of the Abbé Montesquieu.\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, occupy the position long. In the struggles of the\r\nConvention he took part with the Girondists, and refused to vote for\r\nthe death of Louis XVI. He maintained an obstinate struggle against\r\nthe violence of the Mountain. His arrest was decreed; he was dragged\r\nbefore the revolutionary tribunal, and condemned to be executed within\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of the French Revolution hide the doings of Protestantism\r\nand Catholicism alike for several years, until Buonaparte came into\r\npower. He recognised Catholicism as the established religion, and paid\r\nfor the maintenance of the bishops and priests. He also protected\r\nProtestantism, the members of which were entitled to all the benefits\r\nsecured to the other Christian communions, \"with the exception of\r\npecuniary subvention.\"\r\n\r\nThe comparative liberty which the Protestants of France had enjoyed\r\nunder the Republic and the Empire seemed to be in some peril at the\r\nrestoration of the Bourbons. The more bigoted Roman Catholics of the\r\nSouth hailed their return as the precursors of renewed persecution:\r\nand they raised the cry of \"Un Dieu, un Roi, une Foi.\"\r\n\r\nThe Protestant mayor of Nismes was publicly insulted, and compelled to\r\nresign his office. The mob assembled in the streets and sang ferocious\r\nsongs, threatening to \"make black puddings of the blood of the\r\nCalvinists' children.\"[85] Another St. Bartholomew was even\r\nthreatened; the Protestants began to conceal themselves, and many fled\r\nfor refuge to the Upper Cevennes. Houses were sacked, their inmates\r\noutraged, and in many cases murdered.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 85: See the Rev. Mark Wilks's \"History of the\r\n         Persecutions endured by the Protestants of the South of\r\n         France, 1814, 1815, 1816.\" Longmans, 1821.]\r\n\r\nThe same scenes occurred in most of the towns and villages of the\r\ndepartment of Gard; and the authorities seemed to be powerless to\r\nprevent them. The Protestants at length began to take up arms for\r\ntheir defence; the peasantry of the Cevennes brought from their secret\r\nplaces the rusty arms which their fathers had wielded more than a\r\ncentury before; and another Camisard war seemed imminent.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the subject of the renewed Protestant persecutions in\r\nthe South of France was, in May, 1816, brought under the notice of the\r\nBritish House of Commons by Sir Samuel Romilly--himself the descendant\r\nof a Languedoc Huguenot--in a powerful speech; and although the\r\nmotion was opposed by the Government, there can be little doubt that\r\nthe discussion produced its due effect; for the Bourbon Government,\r\nitself becoming alarmed, shortly after adopted vigorous measures, and\r\nthe persecution was brought to an end.\r\n\r\nSince that time the Protestants of France have remained comparatively\r\nunmolested. Evidences have not been wanting to show that the\r\npersecuting spirit of the priest-party has not become extinct. While\r\nthe author was in France in 1870, to visit the scenes of the wars of\r\nthe Camisards, he observed from the papers that a French deputy had\r\nrecently brought a case before the Assembly, in which a Catholic curé\r\nof Ville-d'Avray refused burial in the public cemetery to the corpse\r\nof a young English lady, because she was a Protestant, and remitted it\r\nto the place allotted for criminals and suicides. The body accordingly\r\nlay for eighteen days in the cabin of the gravedigger, until it could\r\nbe transported to the cemetery of Sèvres, where it was finally\r\ninterred.\r\n\r\nBut the people of France, as well as the government, have become too\r\nindifferent about religion generally, to persecute any one on its\r\naccount. The nation is probably even now suffering for its\r\nindifference, and the spectacle is a sad one. It is only the old, old\r\nstory. The sins of the fathers are being visited on the children.\r\nLouis XIV. and the French nation of his time sowed the wind, and their\r\ndescendants at the Revolution reaped the whirlwind. And who knows how\r\nmuch of the sufferings of France during the last few years may have\r\nbeen due to the ferocious intolerance, the abandonment to vicious\r\npleasures, the thirst for dominion, and the hunger for \"glory,\" which\r\nabove all others characterized the reign of that monarch who is in\r\nhistory miscalled \"the Great?\"\r\n\r\nIt will have been noted that the chief scenes of the revival of\r\nProtestantism described in the preceding pages occurred in Languedoc\r\nand the South of France, where the chief strength of the Huguenots\r\nalways lay. The Camisard civil war which happened there, was not\r\nwithout its influence. The resolute spirit which it had evoked\r\nsurvived. The people were purified by suffering, and though they did\r\nnot conquer civil liberty, they continued to live strong, hardy,\r\nvirtuous lives. When Protestantism was at length able to lift up its\r\nhead after so long a period of persecution, it was found that, during\r\nits long submergence, it had lost neither in numbers, in moral or\r\nintellectual vigour, nor in industrial power.\r\n\r\nTo this day the Protestants of Languedoc cherish the memory of their\r\nwanderings and worshippings in the Desert; and they still occasionally\r\nhold their meetings in the old frequented places. Not far from Nismes\r\nare several of these ancient meeting-places of the persecuted, to\r\nwhich we have above referred. One of them is about two miles from the\r\ncity, in the bed of a mountain torrent. The worshippers arranged\r\nthemselves along the slopes of the narrow valley, the pastor preaching\r\nto them from the grassy level in the hollow, while sentinels posted\r\non the adjoining heights gave warning of the approach of the enemy.\r\nAnother favourite place of meeting was the hollow of an ancient quarry\r\ncalled the Echo, from which the Romans had excavated much of the stone\r\nused in the building of the city. The congregation seated themselves\r\naround the craggy sides, the preacher's pulpit being placed in the\r\nnarrow pass leading into the quarry. Notwithstanding all the\r\nvigilance of the sentinels, many persons of both sexes and various\r\nages were often dragged from the Echo to imprisonment or death. Even\r\nafter the persecutions had ceased, these meeting-places continued to\r\nbe frequented by the Protestants of Nismes, and they were sometimes\r\nattended by five or six thousand persons, and on sacrament days by\r\neven double that number.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Protestants of Languedoc for the most part belong to the\r\nNational Reformed Church, the independent character of the people has\r\nled them to embrace Protestantism in other forms. Thus, the\r\nEvangelical Church is especially strong in the South, whilst the\r\nEvangelical Methodists number more congregations and worshippers in\r\nLanguedoc than in all the rest of France. There are also in the\r\nCevennes several congregations of Moravian Brethren. But perhaps one\r\nof the most curious and interesting issues of the Camisard war is the\r\nbranch of the Society of Friends still existing in Languedoc--the only\r\nrepresentatives of that body in France, or indeed on the European\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nWhen the Protestant peasants of the Cevennes took up arms and\r\ndetermined to resist force by force, there were several influential\r\nmen amongst them who kept back and refused to join them. They held\r\nthat the Gospel they professed did not warrant them in taking up arms\r\nand fighting, even against the enemies who plundered and persecuted\r\nthem. And when they saw the excesses into which the Camisards were led\r\nby the war of retaliation on which they had entered, they were the\r\nmore confirmed in their view that the attitude which the rebels had\r\nassumed, was inconsistent with the Christian religion.\r\n\r\nAfter the war had ceased, these people continued to associate\r\ntogether, maintaining a faithful testimony against war, refusing to\r\ntake oaths, and recognising silent worship, without dependence on\r\nhuman acquirements. They were not aware of the existence of a similar\r\nbody in England and America until the period of the French Revolution,\r\nwhen some intercourse began to take place between them.\r\n\r\nIn 1807, Stephen Grellet, an American Friend, of French origin,\r\nvisited Languedoc, and held many religious meetings in the towns and\r\nvillages of the Lower Cevennes, which were not only attended by the\r\nFriends of Congenies, St. Hypolite, Granges, St. Grilles, Fontane's,\r\nVauvert, Quissac, and other places in the neighbourhood of Nismes, but\r\nby the inhabitants at large, Roman Catholics as well as Protestants.\r\nAt that time, as now, Congenies was regarded as the centre of the\r\ndistrict principally inhabited by the Friends, and there they possess\r\na large and commodious meeting-house, built for the purpose of\r\nworship.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Stephen Grellet's visit, he especially mentioned Louis\r\nMajolier as \"a father and a pillar\" amongst the little flock.[86] And\r\nit may not be unworthy to note that the daughter of the same Louis\r\nMajolier is at the present time one of the most acceptable female\r\npreachers of the Society of Friends in England.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 86: \"Life of Stephen Grellet,\" third edition.\r\n         London, 1870.]\r\n\r\nIt may also be mentioned, in passing, that there still exist amongst\r\nthe Vosges mountains the remnants of an ancient sect--the Anabaptists\r\nof Munster--who hold views in many respects similar to those of the\r\nFriends. Amongst other things, they testify against war as\r\nunchristian, and refuse under any circumstances to carry arms. Rather\r\nthan do so, they have at different times suffered imprisonment,\r\npersecution, and even death. The republic of 1793 respected their\r\nscruples, and did not require the Anabaptists to fight in the ranks,\r\nbut employed them as pioneers and drivers, while Napoleon made them\r\nlook after the wounded on the field of battle, and attend to the\r\nwaggon train and ambulances.[87] And we understand that they continue\r\nto be similarly employed down to the present time.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 87: Michel, \"Les Anabaptistes des Vosges.\" Paris,\r\n         1862.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt forms no part of our subject to discuss the present state of the\r\nFrench Protestant Church. It has lost no part of its activity during\r\nthe recent political changes. Although its clergy had for some time\r\nbeen supported by the State, they had not met in public synod until\r\nJune, 1872, after an interval of more than two hundred years. During\r\nthat period many things had become changed. Rationalism had invaded\r\nEvangelicalism. Without a synod, or a settled faith, the Protestant\r\nchurches were only so many separate congregations, often representing\r\nmerely individual interests. In fact, the old Huguenot Church required\r\nreorganization; and great results are expected from the proceedings\r\nadopted at the recently held synod of the French Protestant\r\nChurch.[88]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 88: The best account of the proceedings at this\r\n         synod is given in _Blackwood's Magazine_ for January, 1873.]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the French Catholic Church, its relative position to\r\nthe Protestants remains the same as before. But it has no longer the\r\npower to persecute. The Gallican Church has been replaced by the\r\nUltramontane Church, but its impulses are no kindlier, though it has\r\nbecome \"Infallible.\"\r\n\r\nThe principal movement of the Catholic priests of late years has been\r\nto get up appearances of the Virgin. The Virgin appears, usually, to\r\na child or two, and pilgrimages are immediately got up to the scene of\r\nher visit. By getting up religious movements of this kind, the priests\r\nand their followers believe that France will yet be helped towards the\r\n_Revanche_, which she is said to long for.\r\n\r\nBut pilgrimages will not make men; and if France wishes to be free,\r\nshe will have to adopt some other methods. Bismarck will never be put\r\ndown by pilgrimages. It was a sad saying of Father Hyacinthe at\r\nGeneva, that \"France is bound to two influences--Superstition and\r\nIrreligion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMOIRS OF DISTINGUISHED HUGUENOT REFUGEES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nSTORY OF SAMUEL DE PÉCHELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Louis XIV. revoked the Edict of Nantes, he issued a number of\r\ndecrees or edicts for the purpose of stamping out Protestantism in\r\nFrance. Each decree had the effect of an Act of Parliament. Louis\r\ncombined in himself the entire powers of the State. The King's word\r\nwas law. \"_L'état c'est Moi_\" was his maxim.\r\n\r\nThe Decrees which Louis issued were tyrannical, brutal, and cowardly.\r\nSome were even ludicrous in their inhumanity. Thus Protestant grooms\r\nwere forbidden to give riding-lessons; Protestant barbers were\r\nforbidden to cut hair; Protestant washerwomen were forbidden to wash\r\nclothes; Protestant servants were forbidden to serve either Roman\r\nCatholic or Protestant mistresses. They must all be \"converted.\" A\r\nprofession of the Roman Catholic faith was required from simple\r\nartisans--from shoemakers, tailors, masons, carpenters, and\r\nsuch-like--before they were permitted to labour at their respective\r\ncallings.\r\n\r\nThe cruelty went further. Protestants were forbidden to be employed as\r\nlibrarians and printers. They could not even be employed as labourers\r\nupon the King's highway. They could not serve in any public office\r\nwhatever. They were excluded from the collection of the taxes, and\r\nfrom all government departments. Protestant apothecaries must shut up\r\ntheir shops. Protestant advocates were forbidden to plead before the\r\ncourts. Protestant doctors were forbidden to practise medicine and\r\nsurgery. The _sages-femmes_ must necessarily be of the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nThe cruelty was extended to the family. Protestant parents were\r\nforbidden to instruct their children in their own faith. They were\r\nenjoined, under a heavy penalty, to have their children baptized by\r\nthe Roman Catholic priest, and brought up in the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion. When the law was disobeyed, the priests were empowered to\r\nseize and carry off the children, and educate them, at the expense of\r\nthe parents, in monasteries and nunneries.\r\n\r\nThen, as regards the profession of the Protestant religion:--It was\r\ndecreed by the King, that all the Protestant temples in France should\r\nbe demolished, or converted to other uses. Protestant pastors were\r\nordered to quit the country within fifteen days after the date of the\r\nRevocation of the Edict of Nantes. If found in the country after that\r\nperiod, they were condemned to death. A reward of five thousand five\r\nhundred livres was offered for the apprehension of any Protestant\r\npastor. When apprehended he was hung. Protestant worship was\r\naltogether prohibited. If any Protestants were found singing psalms,\r\nor engaged in prayer, in their own houses, they were liable to have\r\ntheir entire property confiscated, and to be sent to the galleys for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThese monstrous decrees were carried into effect--at a time when\r\nFrance reigned supreme in the domain of intellect, poetry, and the\r\narts--in the days of Racine, Corneille, Molière--of Bossuet,\r\nBourdaloue, and Fénélon. Louis XIV. had the soldier, the hangman, and\r\nthe priest at his command; but they all failed him. They could\r\nimprison, they could torture, they could kill, they could make the\r\nProtestants galley-slaves; they could burn their Bibles, and deprive\r\nthem of everything that they valued; but the impregnable rights of\r\nconscience defied them.\r\n\r\nThe only thing left for the Protestants was to fly from France in all\r\ndirections. They took refuge in Switzerland, Germany, Holland, and\r\nEngland. The flight from France had begun before the Revocation of the\r\nEdict of Nantes, but after that act the flight rapidly increased. Not\r\nless than a million of persons are supposed to have escaped from\r\nFrance in consequence of the Revocation.\r\n\r\nSteps were, however, taken by the King to stop the emigration. He\r\nissued a decree ordering that the property and goods of all those\r\nProtestants who had already escaped should be confiscated to the\r\nCrown, unless they returned within three months from the date of the\r\nRevocation. Then, with respect to the Protestants who remained in\r\nFrance, he decreed that all French_men_ found attempting to escape\r\nwere to be sent to the galleys for life; and that all French_women_\r\nfound attempting to escape were to be imprisoned for life. The spies\r\nwho denounced the fugitive Protestants were rewarded by the\r\napportionment of half their goods.\r\n\r\nThis decree was not, however, considered sufficiently severe, and it\r\nwas shortly after followed by another, proclaiming that any captured\r\nfugitives, as well as any person found acting as their guide, should\r\nbe condemned to death. Another royal decree was issued respecting\r\nthose fugitives who attempted to escape by sea. It was to the effect,\r\nthat before any ship was allowed to set sail for a foreign port, the\r\nhold should be fumigated with a deadly gas, so that any hidden\r\nHuguenot who could not otherwise be detected, might be suffocated to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThese measures, however, did not seem to have the effect of\r\n\"converting\" the French Protestants. The Dragonnades were next\r\nresorted to. Louis XIV. was pleased to call the dragoons his Booted\r\nMissionaries, _ses missionnaires bottés_. The dragonnades are said to\r\nhave been the invention of Michel de Marillac, whose name will\r\ndoubtless descend to infamous notoriety, like those of Catherine de\r\nMédicis, the Guises, and the authors of the Massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew.\r\n\r\nYet there was not much genius displayed in the invention of the\r\nDragonnades. It merely consisted in this: whenever it was found that a\r\ntown abounded with Huguenots, the dragoons, hussars, and troops of\r\nvarious kinds were poured into it, and quartered on the inhabitants.\r\nTwenty, thirty, or forty were quartered together, according to the\r\nsize of the house. They occupied every room; they beat their drums and\r\nblew their trumpets; they smoked, drank, and swore, without any regard\r\nto the infirm, the sick, or the dying, until the inmates were\r\n\"converted.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole army of France was let loose upon the Huguenots. They had\r\nbeen beaten out of Holland by the Dutch Calvinists; and they could now\r\nfearlessly take their revenge out of their unarmed Huguenot\r\nfellow-countrymen. Whenever they quartered themselves in a dwelling,\r\nit was, for the time being, their own. They rummaged the cellars,\r\ndrank the wines, ordered the best of everything, pillaged the house,\r\nand treated everybody who belonged to it as a slave. The Huguenots\r\nwere not only compelled to provide for the entertainment of their\r\nguests, but to pay them their wages. The superior officers were paid\r\nfifteen francs a day, the lieutenants nine francs, and the common\r\nsoldiers three francs. If the money was not paid, the household\r\nfurniture, the horses and cows, and all the other articles that could\r\nbe seized, were publicly sold.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that so many Huguenots were \"converted\" by the dragoons.\r\nForty thousand persons were converted in Poitou. The regiment of\r\nAsfeld was the instrument of their conversion. A company and a half of\r\ndragoons occupied the house of a single lady at Poitiers until she was\r\nconverted to the Roman Catholic faith. What bravery!\r\n\r\nThe Huguenots of Languedoc were amongst the most obstinate of all.\r\nThey refused to be converted by the priests; and then Louis XIV.\r\ndetermined to dragonnade them. About sixty thousand troops were\r\nconcentrated on the province. Noailles, the governor, shortly after\r\nwrote to the King that he had converted the city of Nismes in\r\ntwenty-four hours. Twenty thousand converts had been made in\r\nMontauban; and he promised that by the end of the month there would be\r\nno more Huguenots left in Languedoc.\r\n\r\nMany persons were doubtless converted by force, or by the fear of\r\nbeing dragonnaded; but there were also many more who were ready to run\r\nall risks rather than abjure their faith. Of those who abjured, the\r\ngreater number took the first opportunity of flying from France, by\r\nland or by sea, and taking refuge in Switzerland, Germany, Holland, or\r\nEngland. Many instances might be given of the heroic fortitude with\r\nwhich the Huguenots bore the brutality of their enemies; but, for the\r\npresent, it may be sufficient to mention the case of the De Péchels of\r\nMontauban.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Montauban had been terribly treated before and after\r\nthe Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The town had been one of the\r\nprincipal Huguenot places of refuge in France. Hence its population\r\nwas principally Protestant. Its university had been shut up. Its\r\nchurches had been levelled to the ground. Its professors and pastors\r\nhad been banished from France. And now it was to be dragonnaded.\r\n\r\nThe town was filled with troops, who were quartered on the\r\nProtestants. One of the burgesses called upon the Intendant, threw\r\nhimself at his feet, and prayed to be delivered from the dragoons. \"On\r\none condition only!\" replied Dubois, \"that you become a Catholic.\" \"I\r\ncannot,\" said the townsman, \"because, if the Sultan quartered twenty\r\njanissaries on me, I might, for the same reason, be forced to become a\r\nTurk.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough many of the townsmen pretended to be converted, the\r\nProtestant chiefs held firm to their convictions, and resisted all\r\npersuasions, promises, and threats, to induce them to abjure their\r\nreligion. Amongst them were Samuel de Péchels de la Boissonade and the\r\nMarquise de Sabonnières, his wife, who, in the midst of many trials\r\nand sorrows, preferred to do their duty to every other consideration.\r\n\r\nThe family of De Péchels had long been settled at Montauban. Being\r\nregarded as among the heads of the Protestant party in Montauban, they\r\nwere marked out by the King's ministers for the most vigorous\r\ntreatment. When the troops entered the town on the 20th of August,\r\n1685, they treated the inhabitants as if the town had been taken by\r\nassault. The officers and soldiers vied with each other in committing\r\nacts of violence. They were sanctioned by the magistrate, who\r\nauthorised their excesses, in conformity with the King's will. Tumult\r\nand disorder prevailed everywhere. Houses were broken into. Persons of\r\nthe reformed religion, without regard to age, sex, or condition, were\r\ntreated with indignity. They were sworn at, threatened, and beaten.\r\nTheir families were turned out of doors. Every room in the house was\r\nentered and ransacked of its plate, silk, linen, and clothes. When the\r\nfurniture was too heavy to be carried away, it was demolished. The\r\nmirrors were slashed with swords, or shot at with pistols. In short,\r\nso far as regarded their household possessions, the greater number of\r\nthe Protestants were completely ruined.\r\n\r\nSamuel de Péchels de la Boissonade had no fewer than thirty-eight\r\ndragoons and fusiliers quartered upon him. It was intended at first to\r\nquarter these troopers on Roupeiroux, the King's adjutant; but having\r\npromptly changed his religion to avoid the horrors of the dragonnade,\r\nthey were removed to the house of De Péchels, and he was ordered by\r\nChevalier Duc, their commander, to pay down the money which he had\r\nfailed to get from Roupeiroux, during the days that the troopers\r\nshould have occupied his house. De Péchels has himself told the story\r\nof his sufferings, and we proceed to quote his own words:--\r\n\r\n\"Soon after,\" he says, \"my house was filled with officers, troopers,\r\nand their horses, who took possession of every room with such\r\nunfeeling harshness that I could not reserve a single one for the use\r\nof my family; nor could I make these unfeeling wretches listen to my\r\ndeclaration that I was ready to give up all that I possessed without\r\nresistance. Doors were broken open, boxes and cupboards forced. They\r\nliked better to carry off what belonged to me in this violent manner\r\nthan to take the keys which my wife and I, standing on either side,\r\ncontinued to offer. The granaries served for the reception of their\r\nhorses among the grain and meal, which the wretches, with the greatest\r\nbarbarity, made them trample underfoot. The very bread destined for my\r\nlittle children, like the rest, was contemptuously trodden down by the\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing could stop the brutality of these madmen. I was thrust out\r\ninto the street with my wife, now very near her confinement, and four\r\nvery young children, taking nothing with me but a little cradle and a\r\nsmall supply of linen, for the babe whose birth was almost momentarily\r\nexpected. The street being full of people, diverted at seeing us thus\r\nexposed, we were delayed some moments near the door, during which we\r\nwere pitilessly drenched by the troopers, who amused themselves at the\r\nwindows with emptying upon our heads pitchers of water, to add to\r\ntheir enjoyment of our sad condition.\r\n\r\n\"From this moment I gave up both house and goods to be plundered,\r\nwithout having in view any place of refuge but the street, ill suited,\r\nit must be owned, for such a purpose, and especially so to a woman\r\nexpecting her confinement hourly, and to little children of too tender\r\nan age to make their own way--some of them, indeed, being unable to\r\nwalk or speak--and having no hope but in the mercy of God and His\r\ngracious protection.\"\r\n\r\nDe Péchels proceeded to the house of Marshal Boufflers, commander of\r\nthe district, thinking it probable that a man of honour, such as he\r\nwas supposed to be, would discourage such barbarities, and place the\r\ndragoons under some sort of military control. But no! The Marshal\r\ncould not be found. He carefully kept out of the way of all Protestant\r\ncomplainants. De Péchels, however, met Chevalier Duc, who commanded\r\nthe soldiers that had turned him out of his house. In answer to the\r\nexpostulations of De Péchels, the Chevalier gave him to understand\r\nthat the same treatment would be continued unless he \"changed his\r\nreligion.\" \"Then,\" answered De Péchels, \"by God's help I never will.\"\r\n\r\nAt length, when De Péchels' house had been thoroughly stripped, and\r\nthe dragoons had decamped elsewhere, he received an order to return,\r\nin order to entertain another detachment of soldiers. The criminal\r\njudge, who had possession of the keys, entered the house, and found it\r\nin extreme disorder. \"I was obliged to remain in it,\" says De Péchels,\r\n\"amidst dirt and vermin, in obedience to the Intendant's orders,\r\nreiterated in the strictest manner by the criminal judge, that I\r\nshould await the arrival of a fresh party of lodgers, who accordingly\r\ncame on the day following.\"\r\n\r\nThe new party consisted of six soldiers of the regiment of fusiliers,\r\nwho called themselves simply \"missionaries,\" as distinct from the\r\n\"booted missionaries\" who had just left. They were savage at not\r\nfinding anything to plunder, their predecessors having removed\r\neverything in the shape of booty. The fusiliers were shortly followed\r\nby six soldiers of Dampier's regiment, who were still more ferocious.\r\nThey gave De Péchels and his wife no peace day or night; they kept the\r\nhouse in a constant uproar; swore and sang obscene songs, and carried\r\ntheir insolence to the utmost pitch. At length De Péchels was forced\r\nto quit the house, on account of his wife, who was near the time of\r\nher confinement. These are his own words:--\r\n\r\n\"For a long time we were wandering through the streets, no one daring\r\nto offer us an asylum, as the ordinance of the Intendant imposed a\r\nfine of four or five hundred livres[89] upon any one who should\r\nreceive Protestants into their houses. My mother's house had long been\r\nfilled with soldiers, as well as that of my sister De Darassus; and\r\nnot knowing where to go, I suffered great agony of mind for fear my\r\npoor wife should give birth to her infant in the street. In this\r\nlamentable plight, the good providence of God led us to the house of\r\nMdlle. de Guarrison, my wife's sister, from whence, most fortunately,\r\na large number of soldiers, with their officers, were issuing. They\r\nhad occupied it for some time, and had allowed the family no rest. Now\r\nthey were changing their quarters, to continue their lawless mission\r\nin some country town. The stillness of the house after their departure\r\ninduced us to enter it at once, and hardly had my wife accepted the\r\nbed Mdlle. de Guarrison offered her, than she was happily delivered of\r\na daughter, blessed be God, who never leaves Himself without a witness\r\nto those who fear His name.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 89: The French livre was worth three francs, or\r\n         about two shillings and sixpence English money.]\r\n\r\n\"That same evening a great number of soldiers arrived, and took up\r\ntheir quarters in M. de Guarrison's house, and two days after, this\r\nburden was augmented by the addition of a colonel, a captain, and two\r\nlieutenants, with a large company of soldiers and several servants,\r\nall of whom conducted themselves with a degree of violence scarcely to\r\nbe described. They had no regard for the owners of the house, but\r\nrobbed them with impunity. They had no pity for my poor wife, weak and\r\nill as she was; nor for the helpless children, who suffered much under\r\nthese miserable conditions.\r\n\r\n\"Officers, soldiers, and servants pillaged the house with odious\r\nrivalry, took possession of all the rooms, drove out the owners, and\r\nobliged the poor sick woman (by their continual threats and abominable\r\nconduct) to get up and try to retire to some other place. She crept\r\ninto the courtyard, where, with her infant, she was detained in the\r\ncold for a long time by the soldiers, who would not allow her to quit\r\nthe premises. At length, however, my poor wife got into the street,\r\nstill, however, guarded by soldiers, who would not allow her to go out\r\nof their sight, or to speak with any one. She complained to the\r\nIntendant of their cruel ways, but instead of procuring her any\r\nrelief, he aggravated her affliction, ordering the soldiers to keep\r\nstrict watch over her, never to leave her, and to inform him with what\r\npersons she found a refuge, that he might make them pay the penalty.\"\r\n\r\nDe Péchels' wife was thus under the necessity of sleeping, with her\r\nbabe and her children, in the street. After all was quiet, they sought\r\nfor a door-step, and lay down for the night under the stars.\r\n\r\nMadame de Péchels at length found temporary shelter. Mademoiselle de\r\nDelada, a friend of the Intendant, touched by the poor woman's sad\r\ncondition, implored the magistrate's permission to give her refuge;\r\nand being a well-known Roman Catholic, she was at length permitted to\r\ntake Madame de Péchels and her babe into her house, but on condition\r\nthat four soldiers should still keep her in view. She remained there\r\nfor a short time, until she was able to leave her bed, when she was\r\nprivily removed to a country house belonging to Mademoiselle de\r\nDelada, not far from the town of Montauban.\r\n\r\nTo return to Samuel de Péchels. His house was still overflowing with\r\nsoldiers. They proceeded to wreck what was left of his household\r\neffects; they carried off and sold his papers and his library, which\r\nwas considerable. Some of the soldiers of Dampier's regiment carried\r\noff in a sack a pair of brass chimney dogs, the shovel and tongs, a\r\ngrate, and some iron spits, the wretched remains of his household\r\nfurniture. They proceeded to lay waste his farms and carry off his\r\ncattle, selling the latter by public auction in the square. They next\r\npulled down his house, and sold the materials. After this, ten\r\nsoldiers were quartered in a neighbouring tavern, at De Péchels'\r\nexpense. Not being able to pay the expenses, the Intendant sent some\r\narchers to him to say that he would be carried off to prison unless\r\nhe changed his religion. To that proposal he answered, as before, that\r\n\"by the help of God he would never make that change, and that he was\r\nquite prepared to go to any place to which his merciful Saviour might\r\nlead him.\"\r\n\r\nHe was accordingly taken, into custody, and placed, for a time, in the\r\nRoyal Château. On the same day, his sister De Darassus was committed\r\nto prison. Still holding steadfast by his faith, De Péchels was, after\r\na month's imprisonment at Montauban, removed to the prison of Cahors,\r\nwhere he was put into the lowest dungeon. \"By the grace of my\r\nSaviour,\" said he, \"I strengthened myself more in my determination to\r\ndie rather than renounce the truth.\"\r\n\r\nAfter lying for more than three months in the dampest mould of the\r\nlowest dungeon in the prison of Cahors, and being still found\r\nimmovable in his faith, De Péchels was ordered to be taken to the\r\ncitadel of Montpellier, to wait there until he could be transported to\r\nAmerica. His wife, the Marquise de Sabonnières, having heard of his\r\ncondemnation (though he was never tried), determined to see him before\r\nhe left France for ever. The road from Cahors to Montpellier did not\r\npass through Montauban, but a few miles to the east of it. Having\r\nspent the night in prayer to God, that He might endow her with\r\nfirmness to sustain the trials of a scene, which was as heroic in her\r\nas it was touching to those who witnessed it, she went forth in the\r\nmorning to wait along the roadside for the arrival of the illustrious\r\nbody of prisoners, who were on their way, some to the galleys, some to\r\nbanishment, some to imprisonment, and some to death.\r\n\r\nAt length the glorious band arrived. They were chained two and two.\r\nThey were for the most part ladies and gentlemen who had refused to\r\nabjure their religion. Among them were M. Desparvés, a gentleman from\r\nthe neighbourhood of Laitoure, old and blind, led by his wife; M. de\r\nla Rességuerie, of Montauban, and many more. Madame de Péchels\r\nimplored leave of the guard who conducted the prisoners to have an\r\ninterview with her husband. It was granted. She had been supplied with\r\nthe fortitude for which she had so ardently and piously prayed to God\r\nduring the whole of the past night. It seemed as if some supernatural\r\npower had prompted the discourse with her husband, which softened the\r\nhearts of those who, up to that time, had appeared inaccessible to the\r\nsentiments of humanity. The superintendent allowed the noble couple to\r\npray together; after which they were separated without the least\r\nweakness betraying itself on the part of Madame de Péchels, who\r\nremained unmoved, whilst all the bystanders were melted into tears.\r\nThe procession of guards and prisoners then went on its way.\r\n\r\nThe trials of Madame de Péchels were not yet ended. Though she had\r\nparted with her husband, who was now on his way to banishment, she had\r\nstill the children with her; and, cruellest torture of all! these were\r\nnow to be torn from her. One evening a devoted friend came to inform\r\nher that a body of men were to arrive next morning and take her\r\nchildren, even the baby from her breast, and immure them in a convent.\r\nShe was also informed that she herself was to be seized and\r\nimprisoned.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence fell like a thunderbolt upon the tender mother. What\r\nwas she to do? Was she to abjure her religion? She prayed for help\r\nfrom God. Part of the night was thus spent before she could make up\r\nher mind to part from her innocent children, who were to be brought up\r\nin a religion at variance with her own. In any case, a separation was\r\nnecessary. Could she not fly, like so many other Protestant women, and\r\nlive in hopes of better days to come? It was better to fly from France\r\nthan encounter the horrors of a French prison. Before she parted with\r\nher children she embraced them while they slept; she withdrew a few\r\nsteps to tear herself from them, and again she came back to bid them a\r\nlast farewell!\r\n\r\nAt length, urged by the person who was about to give her a refuge in\r\nhis house, she consented to follow him. The man was a weaver by trade,\r\nand all day long he carried on his work in the only room which he\r\npossessed. Madame de Péchels passed the day in a recess, concealed by\r\nthe bed of her entertainers, and in the evening she came out, and the\r\ngood people supplied her with what was necessary. She passed six\r\nmonths in this retreat, without any one knowing what had become of\r\nher. It was thought that she had taken refuge in some foreign country.\r\n\r\nNumbers of ladies had already been able to make their escape. The\r\nfrontier was strictly guarded by troops, police, and armed peasantry.\r\nThe high-roads as well as the byways were patrolled day and night, and\r\nall the bridges were strongly guarded. But the fugitives avoided the\r\nfrequented routes. They travelled at night, and hid themselves during\r\nthe day. There were Protestant guides who knew every pathway leading\r\nout of France, through forests, wastes, or mountain paths, where no\r\npatrols were on the watch; and they thus succeeded in leading\r\nthousands of refugee Protestants across the frontier. And thus it was\r\nthat Madame de Péchels was at length enabled, with the help of a\r\nguide, to reach Geneva, one of the great refuges of the Huguenots.\r\n\r\nOn arrival there she felt the loss of her children more than ever.\r\nShe offered to the guide who had conducted her all the money that she\r\npossessed to bring her one or other of her children. The eldest girl,\r\nthen nine or ten years old, was communicated with, but having already\r\ntasted the pleasure of being her own mistress, she refused the\r\nproposal to fly into Switzerland to join her mother. Her son Jacob was\r\nnext communicated with. He was seven years old. He was greatly moved\r\nat the name of his mother, and he earnestly entreated to be taken to\r\nwhere she was. The guide at once proceeded to fulfil his engagement.\r\nThe boy fled with him from France, passing for his son. The way was\r\nlong--some five hundred miles. The journey occupied them about three\r\nweeks. They rested during the day, and travelled at night. They\r\navoided every danger, and at length the faithful guide was able to\r\nplace the loving son in the arms of his noble and affectionate mother.\r\n\r\nSamuel de Péchels was condemned to banishment without the shadow of a\r\ntrial. He could not be dragooned into denying his faith, and he was\r\ntherefore imprisoned, preparatory to his expulsion from France. \"I was\r\ntold,\" he said, \"by the Sieur Raoul, Roqueton (or chief archer) to the\r\nIntendant of Montauban, that if I would not change my religion, he had\r\norders from the King and the Intendant to convey me to the citadel of\r\nMontpellier, from thence to be immediately shipped for America. My\r\nreply was, that I was ready to go forthwith whithersoever it was God's\r\npleasure to lead me, and that assuredly, by God's help, I would make\r\nno change in my religion.\"\r\n\r\nAfter five months' imprisonment at Cahors, he was taken out and\r\nmarched, as already related, to the citadel of Montpellier. The\r\ncitadel adjoins the Peyrou, a lofty platform of rock, which commands\r\na splendid panoramic view of the surrounding country. It is now laid\r\nout as a pleasure-ground, though it was then the principal\r\nhanging-place of the Languedoc Protestants. Brousson, and many other\r\nfaithful pastors of the \"Church in the Desert,\" laid down their lives\r\nthere. Half-a-dozen decaying corpses might sometimes be seen swinging\r\nfrom the gibbets on which the ministers had been hung.\r\n\r\nA more bitter fate was, however, reserved for De Péchels. After about\r\na month's imprisonment in the citadel, he was removed to Aiguesmortes,\r\nunder the charge of several mounted archers and foot soldiers. He was\r\naccompanied by fourteen Protestant ladies and gentlemen, on their way\r\nto perpetual imprisonment, to the galleys, or to banishment.\r\nAiguesmortes was the principal fortified dungeon in the south of\r\nFrance, used for the imprisonment of Huguenots who refused to be\r\nconverted. It is situated close to the Mediterranean, and is\r\nsurrounded by lagunes and salt marshes. It is a most unhealthy place;\r\nand imprisonment at Aiguesmortes was considered a slower but not a\r\nless certain death than hanging. Sixteen Huguenot women were confined\r\nthere in 1686, and the whole of them died within five months. When the\r\nprisoners died off, the place was at once filled again. The castle of\r\nAiguesmortes was thus used as a prison for nearly a hundred years.\r\n\r\nDe Péchels gives the following account of his journey from Montpellier\r\nto Aiguesmortes:--\"Mounted on asses, harnessed in the meanest manner,\r\nwithout stirrups, and with wretched ropes for halters, we entered\r\nAiguesmortes, and were there locked up in the Tower of Constance, with\r\nthirty other male prisoners and twenty women and girls, who had also\r\nbeen brought hither, tied two and two. The men were placed in an\r\nupper apartment of the tower, and the women and girls below, so that\r\nwe could hear each other pray to God and sing His praises with a loud\r\nvoice.\"\r\n\r\nDe Péchels did not long remain a prisoner at Aiguesmortes. He was\r\nshortly after put on board a king's ship bound for Marseilles. He was\r\nvery ill during the voyage, suffering from seasickness and continual\r\nfainting fits. On reaching Marseilles he was confined in the hospital\r\nprison used for common felons and galley-slaves. It was called the\r\nChamber of Darkness, because of its want of light. The single\r\napartment contained two hundred and thirty prisoners. Some of them\r\nwere chained together, two and two; others, three and three. The\r\nmiserable palliasses on which they slept had been much worn by the\r\ngalley-slaves, who had used them during their illnesses. The women\r\nwere separated from the men by a linen cloth attached to the ceiling,\r\nwhich was drawn across every evening, and formed the only partition\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nAs may easily be supposed, the condition of the prisoners was\r\nfrightful. The swearing of the common felons was mixed with the\r\nprayers of the Huguenots. The guards walked about all night to keep\r\nwatch and ward over them. They fell upon any who assembled and knelt\r\ntogether, separating them and swearing at them, and mercilessly\r\nill-treating them, men and women alike. \"But all their strictness and\r\nrage,\" says De Péchels, \"could not prevent one from seeing always, in\r\ndifferent parts of the dungeon, little groups upon their knees,\r\nimploring the mercy of God and singing His praises, whilst others kept\r\nnear the guards so as to hinder them from interfering with the little\r\nbands of worshippers.\"\r\n\r\nAt length the time arrived for the embarkation of the Huguenots for\r\nAmerica. On the 18th of September, 1687, De Péchels, with fifty-eight\r\nmen and twenty-one women, was put on board a _flûte_ called the\r\n_Mary_--the French _flûte_ consisting of a heavy narrow-sterned\r\nvessel, called in England a \"pink.\" De Péchels was carefully separated\r\nfrom all with whom he had formed habits of intimacy, and whose\r\npresence near him would doubtless have helped him to bear the\r\nbitterness of his fate. On the same day, ninety prisoners of both\r\nsexes were embarked in another ship, named the _Concord_, bound for\r\nthe same destination. The two vessels set sail in the first place for\r\nToulon, in order to obtain an escort of two ships-of-war.\r\n\r\nThe voyage was very disastrous. Three hours after the squadron had\r\nleft Toulon, the _Mary_ was nearly dashed against a rock, owing to the\r\nroughness of the weather. Three days after, a frightful storm arose,\r\nand dashed the prisoners against each other. All were sick; indeed, De\r\nPéchels' malady lasted during the entire voyage. The squadron first\r\ncast anchor amongst the Formentera Islands, off the coast of Spain,\r\nwhere they took in water. On the next day they anchored in the Straits\r\nof Gibraltar for the same purpose. They next sailed for Cadiz, but a\r\nstrong west wind having set in, the ship was forced back to the road\r\nof Gibraltar. After waiting there for three days they again started,\r\nunder the shelter of a Dutch fleet of eighteen sail, \"which,\" says De\r\nPéchels, \"providentially saved us from falling into the hands of the\r\nAlgerine corsairs, some of whom had appeared in sight, and from whose\r\nhands God, in His great mercy, delivered us.\" As if the Algerine\r\ncorsairs would have treated the Huguenots worse than their own king\r\nwas now treating them. The Algerine corsairs would have sold them into\r\nslavery; whilst the French king was transporting them to America for\r\nthe same purpose.\r\n\r\nAt length the squadron reached Cadiz roads. Many ships were\r\nthere--English as well as Dutch. When the foreigners heard of the\r\nstate and misfortunes of the Huguenots on board the French ships, they\r\ncame to visit them in their anchoring ground, and were profuse in\r\ntheir charity to the prisoners for conscience' sake confined in the\r\ntwo French vessels. \"God, who never leaves Himself without witness,\r\nbrought us consolation and relief from this town, where superstition\r\nand bigotry reign in their fullest force.\" As it was in De Péchels'\r\nday, so it is now.\r\n\r\nAt length the French squadron set sail for America. The voyage was\r\ntedious and miserable. There were about a hundred and thirty prisoners\r\non board. Seventy of them were sick felons, chained with heavy irons.\r\nBeing useless for the French galleys, they were now being transported\r\nto America, to be sold as slaves. The imprisoned Huguenots--men and\r\nwomen--were fifty-nine in number. They were crammed into a part of the\r\nship that could scarcely hold them. They could not stand upright; nor\r\ncould they lie down. They had to lie upon each other. The den was\r\nmoreover very dark, the only light that entered it being through the\r\nnarrow hatchway; and even this was often closed. The wonder is that\r\nthey were not suffocated outright.\r\n\r\nThe burning heat of the sun shining on the deck above them, the\r\nnever-ceasing fire of the kitchen, which was situated alongside their\r\nplace of confinement, created such a stifling heat, that the prisoners\r\nhad to take off their shirts to relieve their agony. The horrid stench\r\narising from so many persons being crowded together, and the entire\r\nwant of the means of cleanliness, caused the inmates to become covered\r\nwith vermin. They were also tormented by the intolerable thirst which\r\nno means were taken to allay. Their feeding was horrible; for they\r\nmust be kept alive in some way, in order that the intentions of their\r\ngracious sovereign might be carried into effect. One day they had\r\nstinking salt beef; the next, cod fish half boiled; then peas as hard\r\nas when they were put into the pot; and at other times, dried cod\r\nfish, or rank cheese. These things, together with the violent motion\r\nof the sea, occasioned severe sickness, from which many of the\r\nsufferers were relieved by death. This deplorable voyage extended over\r\nfive months. Here is De Péchels' account of the sufferings of the\r\nprisoners, written in his own words:--\r\n\r\n\"The intense and suffocating heat, the horrible odour, the maddening\r\nswarm of vermin that devoured us, the incessant thirst and wretched\r\nfare, sufficed not to satisfy our overseers. They sometimes struck us\r\nrudely, and very often threw down sea-water upon us, when they saw us\r\nengaged in prayer and praise to God. The common talk of these enemies\r\nof the truth was how they would hang, when they came to America, every\r\nman who would not go to mass, and how they would deliver the women to\r\nthe natives. But far from being frightened at these threats, or even\r\nmoved by all the barbarities of which we were the victims, many of us\r\nfelt a secret joy that we were chosen to suffer for the holy name of\r\nJesus, who strengthened us with a willingness to die for His sake. For\r\nmyself, these menaces had been so often repeated during my\r\nimprisonments, that they had become familiar; insomuch that, far from\r\nbeing shaken by them any more than by the sufferings to which it had\r\npleased my Saviour to call me, I considered them as transient things,\r\nnot worthy to be weighed against the glory to come, and such as would\r\nprocure me a weight of glory supremely excellent. 'Blessed are they\r\nwho are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom\r\nof heaven.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of January, 1688, the island of San Domingo came in sight.\r\nIt was for the most part inhabited by savages. The French had a\r\nsettlement on the west coast of the island, and the Spaniards occupied\r\nthe eastern part. Dense forests separated the two settlements. The\r\n_Mary_ coasted along the island, and afterwards made sail for\r\nGuadaloupe, another colony belonging to the French. The ship seemed as\r\nyet to have had no proper destination, for, four days later, the\r\n_Mary_ weighed her anchor, and sailed to St. Christopher, another\r\nisland partly belonging to the French. \"It was well situated,\" says De\r\nPéchels, \"as may readily be believed, when I add that it possessed a\r\ncolony of Jesuits--an order which never selects a bad situation. The\r\nJesuits here are very rich and in high repute. Two of the fraternity,\r\nhaving come on board, were received by the crew with every\r\ndemonstration of respect; and on their retirement, three guns were\r\nfired as a mark of honour to the distinguished visitors.\"\r\n\r\nThe Huguenots were still under hatches,--weary, longing, wretched, and\r\nmiserable. They were most anxious to be put on shore--anywhere, even\r\namong savages. But the _Mary_ had not yet arrived at her destination.\r\nShe again set sail, and passed St. Kitts, St. Eustace, St. Croix,\r\nPorto Rico, and at length again reached San Domingo. The ship dropped\r\nanchor before Port au Prince, the residence of the governor. The\r\ngalley-slaves were disembarked and sold. Some of the Huguenots were\r\nalso sold for slaves, though De Péchels was not among them. The rest\r\nwere transferred to the _Maria_, a king's ship, commanded by M. de\r\nBeauguay, who treated the prisoners with much humanity. The ship then\r\nset sail for Léogane, another part of the colony, where the remaining\r\nHuguenots were disembarked. They were quartered on the inhabitants at\r\nthe pleasure of the governor.\r\n\r\nDe Péchels says that he passed his time at this place in tranquillity,\r\nwaiting till it might please God to afford him an opportunity of\r\nescaping from his troubles. He visited the inhabitants, especially\r\nthose of his own religious persuasion--a circumstance which gave much\r\numbrage to the Dominican monks. They ordered some of the bigots among\r\ntheir parishioners to lodge a complaint against him with the governor,\r\nto the effect that he was hindering his fellow-prisoners from becoming\r\nRoman Catholics, and preventing those who had become so from going to\r\nmass. He accordingly received a verbal command from M. Dumas, the\r\nKing's lieutenant, to repair immediately to Avache (probably La\r\nVache), an island about a hundred leagues distant from Léogane. He was\r\naccordingly despatched by ship to Avache, which he reached on the 8th\r\nof June. He was put in charge of Captain Laurans, a renowned\r\nfreebooter, and was specially lodged under his roof. The captain was\r\nordered never to lose sight of his prisoner.\r\n\r\nDe Péchels suffered much at this place in consequence of the intense\r\nheat, and the insects, mosquitoes, and horrible flies by which he was\r\nsurrounded. \"And yet,\" he says, \"God in His great mercy willed that in\r\nthis very place I should find the means of escaping from my exile, and\r\nmaking my way to the English island of Jamaica. On the 13th of August\r\na little shallop of that generous nation, in its course from the\r\nisland of St. Thomas to Jamaica, stopped at Avache to water and take\r\nprovisions. Two months already had I watched for such an opportunity,\r\nand now that God had presented me with this, I thought it should not\r\nbe neglected. So fully was I persuaded of this, that without\r\nreflecting upon the smallness of the shallop, I put myself on board\r\nwith victuals for four days, although assured that the passage would\r\nonly occupy three. But instead of performing the passage in three\r\ndays, as we had thought, it was ten days before we made the island,\r\nduring the whole of which time I was constantly unwell from bad\r\nweather and consequent seasickness. During the last three days I\r\nsuffered also from hunger, my provisions being spent, with the\r\nexception of some little wretched food, salt and smoky, which the\r\nsailors eat to keep themselves from starving. God, in His great\r\ncompassion, preserved me from all dangers, and brought me happily to\r\nJamaica, where, however, I thought to leave my bones.\"\r\n\r\nThe voyage was followed by a serious illness. De Péchels was obliged\r\nto take to his bed, where he lay for fifteen days prostrated by fever,\r\naccompanied by incessant pains in his head. After the fever had left\r\nhim, he could neither walk nor stand. By slow degrees his strength\r\nreturned. He was at length able to walk; and he then began to make\r\narrangements for setting out for England. On the 1st of October he\r\nembarked on board an English vessel bound for London. During his\r\nvoyage north he suffered from cold, as much as he had before suffered\r\nfrom heat. At length the coast of England was sighted. Two days after,\r\nthe ship reached the Downs; and on the 22nd of December it was borne\r\nup the Thames by the tide, to within about seven miles from London\r\nBridge. There the ship stopped to discharge part of her cargo; and De\r\nPéchels, having taken his place on board a small sloop for the great\r\ncity, arrived there at ten o'clock the same night.\r\n\r\nOn arrival in London, De Péchels proceeded to make inquiry amongst his\r\nHuguenot friends--who had by that time reached England in great\r\nnumbers--for his wife, his children, his mother, and his sisters.\r\nAlas! what disappointment! He found no wife, no child, nor any\r\nrelation ready to welcome him. His wife, however, was living at\r\nGeneva, with their only son; for the youngest had died at Montauban\r\nduring De Péchels' exile. His daughters were still at Montauban--the\r\neldest in a convent. His mother and youngest sister were both in\r\nprison--the one at Moissac, the other at Auvillard. A message was,\r\nhowever, sent to Madame de Péchels, that her husband was now in\r\nEngland, and longing to meet her.\r\n\r\nIt was long before the message reached Madame de Péchels; and still\r\nlonger before she could join her husband in London. While at Geneva,\r\nshe had maintained herself and her son by the work of her hands. On\r\nreceiving the message she immediately set out, but her voyage could\r\nnot fail to be one of hardship to a person in her reduced\r\ncircumstances. We are not informed how she and her son contrived to\r\ntravel the long distance of eight hundred miles (by way of the Rhine\r\nand Holland) from Geneva to London; but at length she reached the\r\nEnglish capital, when she had the mortification to find that her\r\nhusband was not there, but had left London for Ireland only four days\r\nbefore. During the absence of her husband, Madame de Péchels, whose\r\ncourage never abandoned her, chose rather to stoop to the most\r\ntoilsome labours than to have recourse to the charity of the\r\ngovernment, of which many, less self-helping, or perhaps more\r\nnecessitous, did not scruple to take advantage.\r\n\r\nWe must now revert to the circumstances under which De Péchels left\r\nLondon for Ireland. At the time when he arrived in England, the\r\ncountry was in the throes of a Revolution. Only a month before,\r\nWilliam of Orange had landed at Torbay, with a large body of troops,\r\na considerable proportion of which consisted of Huguenot officers and\r\nsoldiers. There were three strong regiments of Huguenot infantry, and\r\na complete squadron of Huguenot cavalry. Marshal Schomberg, next in\r\ncommand to William of Orange, was a banished Huguenot; and many of his\r\nprincipal officers were French.\r\n\r\nJames II. had so distinctly shown his disposition to carry back the\r\nnation to the Roman Catholic religion, that the Prince of Orange, on\r\nhis landing at Torbay, was hailed as the deliverer of England. His\r\ntroops advanced direct upon London. He was daily joined by fresh\r\nadherents; by the gentry, officers, and soldiers. There was scarcely a\r\nshow of resistance; and when he entered London, James was getting on\r\nboard a smack in the Thames, and slinking ignominiously out of his\r\nkingdom. Towards the end of June, 1689, William and Mary were\r\nproclaimed King and Queen of Great Britain; and they were solemnly\r\ncrowned at Westminster about three months after.\r\n\r\nBut James II. had not yet been got rid of. In the spring of 1689 he\r\nlanded at Kinsale, in Ireland, with substantial help obtained from the\r\nFrench king. Before many weeks had elapsed, forty thousand Irish stood\r\nin arms to support his cause. It was clear that William III. must\r\nfight for his throne, and that Ireland was to be the battle-field. He\r\naccordingly called his forces together again--for the greater part had\r\nbeen disbanded--when he prepared to take the field in person. Four\r\nHuguenot regiments were at once raised, three infantry regiments, and\r\none cavalry regiment. The cavalry regiment was raised by Marshal\r\nSchomberg, its colonel. It was composed of French gentlemen, privates\r\nas well as officers. De Péchels was offered a commission in the\r\nregiment, which he cheerfully accepted. He assumed the name of his\r\nbarony, La Boissonade, as was common in those days; and he acted as\r\nlieutenant in the company of La Fontain.\r\n\r\nThe regiment, when completed, was at once despatched to the north of\r\nIreland to join the little army of about ten thousand Protestants, who\r\nhad already laid siege to and taken the fortified town of\r\nCarrickfergus. Schomberg's regiment embarked from Chester, on Monday,\r\nthe 25th of August, 1689; and on the following Saturday the squadron\r\narrived in Belfast Lough. The troopers were landed a little to the\r\nwest of Carrickfergus, and marched along the road towards Belfast,\r\nwhich is still known as \"Troopers' Lane.\" Next day the Duke moved on\r\nin pursuit of the enemy. The regiment passed through Belfast, which\r\nwas then a very small place. It consisted of a few streets of thatched\r\ncottages, grouped around what is now known as the High Street of\r\nBelfast. Schomberg's regiment joined the infantry and the\r\nEnniskilleners, who were encamped in a wood on the west of the town.\r\n\r\nNext morning the little army started in pursuit of the enemy, who,\r\nthough in much greater numbers, fled before them, laying waste the\r\ncountry. At night Schomberg's troops encamped at Lisburn; on the\r\nfollowing day at Dromore; on the third at Brickclay (this must be\r\nLoughbrickland); and then on to Newry. All the villages they passed\r\nwere either burnt or burning. At length they heard that James's Irish\r\narmy was at Newry, and that the Duke of Berwick (James's natural son)\r\nwas in possession of the town with a strong body of horse. But before\r\nSchomberg could reach the place the Duke of Berwick had evacuated it,\r\nleaving the town in flames. The Duke had fled with such haste that he\r\nhad left some of his baggage behind him, and thrown his cannon into\r\nthe river. Schomberg ordered his cavalry to advance rapidly upon\r\nDundalk, in order to prevent the town from sharing the same fate as\r\nNewry. This forced march took the enemy by surprise. They suddenly\r\nabandoned Dundalk, without burning it, and never paused until they had\r\nreached the entrenched camp of King James.\r\n\r\nThe weather had now become cold, dreary, and rainy. Provisions were\r\nscarcely to be had. The people of Dundalk were themselves starving.\r\nStrong bodies of cavalry foraged the country, but were able to find\r\nnext to nothing in the shape of food for themselves, or corn for their\r\nhorses. The ships from England, laden with provisions which ought to\r\nhave arrived at Belfast, were forced back by contrary winds. Thus the\r\narmy was becoming rapidly famished. Disease soon made its appearance,\r\nand carried off the men by hundreds. Schomberg's camp, outside\r\nDundalk, was situated by the side of a marsh--a most unwholesome\r\nposition; but the marsh protected him from the enemy, who were not far\r\noff. The rain and snow continued; the men and the horses were\r\nperpetually drenched; and scouring winds blew across the camp. Ague,\r\ndysentery, and fever everywhere prevailed. Dalrymple has recorded that\r\nof fifteen thousand men who belonged to Schomberg's army, not less\r\nthan eight thousand perished. Under these circumstances, the greatly\r\nreduced force broke up from their cantonments and went into winter\r\nquarters. Schomberg's cavalry regiment was stationed at Lurgan, then a\r\nsmall village, which happily had not been burnt. De Péchels was one of\r\nthose who had been sick in camp, and was disabled from pursuing the\r\ncampaign further. After remaining for some weeks at Lurgan, he\r\nobtained leave from the Duke of Schomberg to return to London. And\r\nthere, after the lapse of four years, he found and embraced his\r\nbeloved and noble wife.\r\n\r\nDe Péchels continued invalided, and was unable to rejoin the army of\r\nKing William. \"After some stay in London,\" he says, in the memoir from\r\nwhich the above extracts are made, \"it was the King's pleasure to\r\nexempt from further service certain officers specified by name, and to\r\nassign them a pension. Through a kind Providence I was included in the\r\nnumber. When I had lived in London on the pension which it had pleased\r\nthe king to allow those officers who were no longer in a position to\r\nserve him, until the 1st of August, 1692, I then left that city, in\r\ncompany with my wife and son, to remove into Ireland, whither my\r\npension was transferred.\"\r\n\r\nDe Péchels accordingly arrived in Dublin, where he spent the rest of\r\nhis days in peace and quiet. He lived to experience the truth of the\r\npromise \"that every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or\r\nsisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my\r\nname's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit\r\neverlasting life.\" De Péchels died in 1732, at a ripe old age, in his\r\neighty-seventh year, and was interred in the Huguenot cemetery in the\r\nneighbourhood of Dublin.\r\n\r\nAnd what of the children left by De Péchels at Montauban? The two\r\ndaughters who were torn from their mother's care, and immured in a\r\nconvent, were brought up in the Roman Catholic faith. The little boy,\r\nwho was also taken from her, died shortly after. The daughters\r\naccordingly secured the possession of the family estates. The eldest\r\nmarried M. de Cahuzac, and the youngest, who was taken as a babe from\r\nher mother's breast, married M. de St. Sardos; and the descendants of\r\nthe latter still possess La Boissonade, which exists as an old château\r\nnear Montauban.\r\n\r\nIt was left for Jacob de Péchels, the only son of Samuel de Péchels\r\nand his wife, the Marquise de Sabonnières, to build up the family\r\nfortunes in England. Following the military instincts of the French,\r\nhe entered the English army at an early age. His name was entered\r\n\"Pechell\" in his War Office commission. Probably this change of name\r\noriginated in the disposition of the naturalised Huguenots to adopt\r\nnames of an English sound rather than to retain their French names.\r\nNumerous instances of this have already been given.[90] Jacob Pechell\r\nwas a gallant officer. He rose in the army, step by step. He fought\r\nthrough the wars in the Low Countries, under Marlborough and Ligonier,\r\nthe latter being a Huguenot like himself. He rose through the various\r\ngrades of ensign, lieutenant, captain, and major, until he attained\r\nthe rank of colonel of the 16th regiment. Colonel Pechell married an\r\nIrish heiress, Jane Elizabeth Boyd, descended from the Earls of\r\nKilmarnock. By her he had three sons and a daughter. Samuel, the\r\neldest, studied law, and became a Master in Chancery. George and Paul\r\nobedient to their military instincts, entered the army, and became\r\ndistinguished officers. George was killed at Carthagena, and it was\r\nleft for Paul to maintain the fortunes of the family.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 90: In \"The Huguenots in England and Ireland,\" 319,\r\n         323, last edition.]\r\n\r\nIn those days the exiled Huguenots and their descendants lived very\r\nmuch together. They married into each other's families. The richer\r\nhelped the poorer. There were distinguished French social circles,\r\nwhere, though their country was forbidden them, they delighted to\r\nspeak in their own language. Like many others, the Pechells\r\nintermarried with Huguenot families. Thus Samuel Pechell married the\r\ndaughter of François Gaultier, Esq., and his sister Mary married\r\nBrigadier-General Cailland, of Aston Rowant.\r\n\r\nAmong the distinguished French nobles in London was the Marquis de\r\nMontandre, descended from the De la Rochefoucaulds, one of the\r\ngreatest families in France. De Montandre was a field-marshal in the\r\nEnglish army, having rendered important services in the Spanish war.\r\nHis wife was daughter of Baron de Spanheim, Ambassador Extraordinary\r\nfor the King of Prussia, and descended from another Protestant\r\nrefugee. The field-marshal left his fortune to his wife, and when she\r\ndied, she left Samuel Pechell, Master in Chancery, her sole executor\r\nand residuary legatee. The sum of money to which he became entitled on\r\nher decease amounted to upwards of £40,000. But Mr. Pechell, from a\r\nhighly sensitive conscience--such as is rarely equalled--did not feel\r\nhimself perfectly justified in acquiring so large a fortune until he\r\nknew that there were no relations of the testatrix in existence, whose\r\nclaim to inherit the property might be greater than his own. He\r\ntherefore collected all her effects, and put them into Chancery, in\r\norder that those who could make good their claims by kindred to the\r\nMarchioness might do so before the Chancellor. Accordingly, one family\r\nfrom Berlin and another from Geneva appeared, and claimed, and\r\nobtained the inheritance. These relations, in acknowledgment of the\r\nkindness and honesty of Mr. Pechell, resolved on presenting him with a\r\nset of Sèvres china, which was at that time beyond all price in value.\r\nIt could only be had as a great favour from the manufactory at Sèvres,\r\nand was only purchased by, or presented to, crowned heads.[91]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 91: This china is now at Castle Goring, and, with\r\n         the whole of the family documents, is in the possession of\r\n         the Dowager Lady Burrell.]\r\n\r\nPaul Pechell, who had entered the army, became a distinguished\r\nofficer, and rose to the rank of general. In 1797 he was created a\r\nbaronet, and married Mary, the only daughter and heiress of Thomas\r\nBrooke, Esq., of Pagglesham, Essex. His eldest son, Sir Thomas, was a\r\nmajor-general in the army, and was for some time M.P. for Downton. The\r\nsecond son, Augustus, was appointed Receiver-General of the Post\r\nOffice in 1785, and of the Customs in 1790. Many of his descendants\r\nstill survive, and the baronetcy reverted to his second son. He was\r\nsucceeded by his two sons, one of whom became rear-admiral, and the\r\nother vice-admiral. The latter, Sir George Richard Brooke Pechell,\r\nentered the Royal Navy in 1803, and served with distinction in several\r\nengagements. After the peace, he represented the important borough of\r\nBrighton in Parliament for twenty-four years. He married the daughter\r\nand coheir of Cecil, Lord Zouche, and added Castle Goring to part of\r\nthe ancient possessions of the Bisshopp family, which she inherited at\r\nher father's death.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cecil Pechell, the only son of Sir George, again following the\r\nmilitary instincts of his race, entered the army, and became captain\r\nof the 77th regiment, with which he served during the Crimean war. He\r\nfell leading on his men to repel an attack made by the Russians on the\r\nadvanced trenches before Sebastopol, on the 3rd of September, 1855. He\r\nwas beloved and deeply lamented by all who knew him; and sorrow at his\r\nloss was expressed by the Queen, by the Commander-in-Chief, by the\r\nwhole of the light division, and by the mayor and principal\r\ninhabitants of Brighton. A statue of Captain Pechell, by Noble, was\r\nerected by public subscription, and now stands in the Pavilion at\r\nBrighton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN RAPIN,\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF THE \"HISTORY OF ENGLAND.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Louis XIV. revoked the Edict of Nantes, he expelled from France\r\nnearly all his subjects who would not conform to the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion. He drove out the manufacturers, who were for the most part\r\nProtestants, and thus destroyed the manufacturing supremacy of France.\r\nHe expelled Protestants of every class--advocates, judges, doctors,\r\nartists, scientists, teachers, and professors. And, last of all, he\r\nexpelled the Protestant soldiers and sailors.\r\n\r\nAccording to Vauban, 12,000 tried soldiers, 9,000 sailors, and 600\r\nofficers left France, and entered into foreign service. Some went to\r\nEngland, some to Holland, and some to Prussia. Those who took refuge\r\nin Holland entered the service of William, Prince of Orange. Most of\r\nthem accompanied him to Torbay in 1688. They fought against the armies\r\nof Louis XIV. at the Boyne, at Athlone, and at Aughrim, and finally\r\ndrove the French out of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe sailors also did good service under the flags of England and\r\nHolland. They distinguished themselves at the sea-fight off La Hogue,\r\nwhere the English and Dutch fleets annihilated the expedition\r\nprepared by Louis XIV. for a descent upon England.\r\n\r\nThe expatriated French soldiers occasionally revisited the country of\r\ntheir birth, not as friends, but as enemies. They encountered the\r\narmies of Louis XIV. in all the battles of the Low Countries. They\r\nfought at Ramilies, Blenheim, and Malplacquet. A Huguenot engineer\r\ndirected the operations at the siege of Namur, which ended in the\r\ncapture of the fortress. Another Huguenot engineer conducted the\r\noperations at Lisle, which was also taken by the allied forces. While\r\nthere, a flying party, consisting chiefly of French Huguenots,\r\npenetrated as far as the neighbourhood of Paris, when they nearly\r\nsucceeded in carrying off the Dauphin.\r\n\r\nThe Huguenot officers who took refuge in Prussia entered the service\r\nof Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. Some were raised to the\r\nhighest offices in his army. Marshal Schomberg was one of the number.\r\nBut when he found that William of Orange was assembling a large force\r\nin Holland for the purpose of making a descent upon England, he\r\nrequested leave to join him; and his friend Prince Frederick William,\r\nthough with great regret, at length granted him permission to leave\r\nthe Prussian service.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the following narrative was a French refugee, who\r\nentered the service of William of Orange. To find the beginning of his\r\nancestry, we must reach far back into history. The Rapins were\r\nsupposed to have been driven from the Campagna of Rome during the\r\npersecutions of Nero. They took refuge in one of the wildest and most\r\npicturesque valleys of the Alps. In 1250 we find the Rapins\r\nestablished near Saint-Jean de la Maurienne, in Savoy, close upon the\r\nFrench frontier. Saint-Jean de la Maurienne was so called because of\r\nthe supposed relic of the bones of St. John the Baptist, which had\r\nbeen deposited there by a female pilgrim, Sainte Thècle, who was, it\r\nis supposed, a Rapin by birth. The fief of Chaudane en Valloires was\r\nthe patrimony of the Rapins, which they long continued to hold. In\r\n1692 the descendants of the family endeavoured to prove, from the\r\nnumerous titles which they possessed, that they had been nobles for\r\neight or nine hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe home of the Rapins was situated in the country of the Vaudois. In\r\n1375 the Vaudois descended from their mountains and preached the\r\ngospel in the valleys of Savoy. The Pope appealed to the King of\r\nFrance, who sent an army into the district. The Vaudois were crushed.\r\nThose who remained fled back to the mountains. Nevertheless the\r\nReformed religion spread in the district. An Italian priest, Raphaël\r\nBordeille, even preached the gospel in the cathedral of Saint-Jean de\r\nMaurienne. But he was suddenly arrested. He was seized, tried for the\r\ncrime of heresy, and burnt in front of the cathedral on Holy Thursday,\r\nin Passion Week, 1550.\r\n\r\nThough the Rapin family held many high offices in Church and State,\r\nseveral of them attached themselves to the Reformed religion. Three\r\nbrothers at length left their home in Savoy, and established\r\nthemselves in France during the reign of Francis I. Without entering\r\ninto their history during the long-continued religious wars which\r\ndevastated the south of France, it may be sufficient to state that two\r\nof the brothers took an active part under Condé. Antoine de Rapin held\r\nimportant commands at Toulouse, at Montauban, at Castres and\r\nMontpellier. Philibert de Rapin, his younger brother, was one of the\r\nmost valiant and trusted officers of the Reformed party. He was\r\nselected by the Prince of Condé to carry into Languedoc the treaty of\r\npeace signed at Longjumeaux on the 20th March, 1568.\r\n\r\nFeeling safe under the royal commission, he presented to the\r\nParliament at Toulouse the edict with which he was intrusted. He then\r\nretired to his country house at Grenade, on the outskirts of Toulouse.\r\nHe was there seized like a criminal, brought before the judges, and\r\nsentenced to be beheaded in three days. The treaty was thus annulled.\r\nWar went on as before. Two years after, the army of Coligny appeared\r\nbefore Toulouse. The houses and châteaux of the councillors of\r\nParliament were burnt, and on their smoking ruins were affixed the\r\nsignificant words, \"_Vengeance de Rapin_.\"\r\n\r\nPhilibert de Rapin's son Pierre embraced the career of arms almost\r\nfrom his boyhood. He served under the Prince of Navarre. He was almost\r\nas poor as the Prince. One day he asked him for some pistoles to\r\nreplace a horse which had been killed under him in action. The Prince\r\nreplied, \"I should like to give you them, but do you see I have only\r\nthree shirts!\" Pierre at length became Seigneur and Baron of Manvers,\r\nthough his château was destroyed and burnt during his absence with the\r\narmy. Destructions of the same kind were constantly taking place\r\nthroughout the whole of France. But, to the honour of humanity, it\r\nmust be told that when his château was last destroyed, the Catholic\r\ngentlemen of the neighbourhood brought their labourers to the place,\r\nand tilled and sowed his abandoned fields. When Rapin arrived eight\r\nmonths later, he was surprised and gratified to find his estate in\r\nperfect order. This was a touching proof of the esteem with which this\r\nProtestant gentleman was held by his Catholic neighbours.\r\n\r\nPierre de Rapin died in 1647 at the age of eighty-nine. He left\r\ntwenty-two children by his second wife. His eldest son Jean succeeded\r\nto the estate of Manvers and to the title of baron. Like his father,\r\nhe was a soldier. He first served under the Prince of Orange, who was\r\nthen a French prince, head of the principality of Orange. He served\r\nunder the King of France in the war with Spain. He was a frank and\r\nloyal soldier, yet firmly attached to the faith of his fathers. He\r\nbelonged to the old Huguenot phalanx, who, as the Duke de Mayenne\r\nsaid, \"were always ready for death, from father to son.\" After the\r\nwars were over, he gave up the sword for the plough. His château was\r\nin ruins, and he had to live in a very humble way until his fortunes\r\nwere restored. He used to say that his riches consisted in his four\r\nsons, who were all worthy of the name they bore.\r\n\r\nJacques de Rapin, Seigneur de Thoyras, was the second son of Pierre de\r\nRapin. Thoyras was a little hamlet near Grenade, adjacent to the\r\nbaronial estate of Manvers. Jacques studied the law. He became an\r\nadvocate, and practised with success, for about fifty years, at\r\nCastres and other cities and towns in the south of France. When the\r\nEdict of Nantes was revoked, the Protestants were no longer permitted\r\nto practise the law, and he was compelled to resign his profession. He\r\ndied shortly after, but the authorities would not even allow his\r\ncorpse to be buried in the family vault. They demolished his place of\r\ninterment, and threw his body into a ditch by the side of the road.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Paul de Rapin, son of Jean, Baron de Manvers, had\r\nmarried the eldest daughter of Jacques, Seigneur de Thoyras. Paul,\r\nlike many of his ancestors, entered the army. He served with\r\ndistinction under the Duke of Luxembourg in Holland, Flanders, and\r\nItaly, yet he never rose above the rank of captain. On his death in\r\n1685, his widow and two daughters (being Protestants) were apprehended\r\nin their château at Manvers, and incarcerated in convents at\r\nMontpellier and Toulouse. Her sons were also taken away, and placed in\r\nother convents. They were only liberated after five years'\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\nMadame de Rapin then resolved to quit France entirely. She contrived\r\nto reach Holland, and established her family at Utrecht. Her\r\nbrother-in-law, Daniel de Rapin, had already escaped from France, and\r\nachieved the position of colonel in the Dutch service.\r\n\r\nRaoul de Cazenove, the author of \"Rapin-Thoyras, sa Famille, sa Vie,\r\net ses OEuvres,\" says, \"The women of the house of Rapin distinguished\r\nthemselves more than once by like courage. Strengthened and fortified\r\nby persecutions, the Reformed were willing to die in exile, far from\r\ntheir beloved children who had been violently snatched from them, but\r\nleaving with them a holy heritage of example and of firmness in their\r\nfaith. The pious lessons of their mothers, profoundly engraved on the\r\nhearts of their daughters, sufficed more than once to save them from\r\napostasy, which was rendered all the more easy by the feebleness of\r\ntheir youth and the perfidious suggestions by which they were\r\nsurrounded.\"\r\n\r\nWe return to Paul de Rapin-Thoyras, second son of Madame de Rapin. He\r\nwas born at Castres in 1661. He received his first lessons at home. He\r\nlearnt the Latin rudiments, but his progress was not such as to\r\nplease his father. He was then sent to the academy at Puylaurens,\r\nwhere the Protestant noblesse of the south of France were still\r\npermitted to send their sons. The celebrated Bayle was educated there.\r\nBut in 1685 the academy of Puylaurens was suppressed, as that of\r\nMontauban had been a few years before; and then young Rapin was sent\r\nto Saumur, one of the few remaining schools in France where\r\nProtestants were allowed to be educated.\r\n\r\nRapin finished his studies and returned home. He wished to enter the\r\narmy, but his father was so much opposed to it, that he at length\r\nacceded to his desires and commenced the study of the law. He was\r\nalready prepared for being received to the office of advocate, when\r\nthe royal edict was passed which prevented Protestants from practising\r\nbefore the courts; and, indeed, prevented them from following any\r\nprofession whatever. Immediately after the death of his father, Paul\r\nde Rapin, accompanied by his younger brother Solomon, emigrated from\r\nFrance and proceeded into England.\r\n\r\nIt was not without a profound feeling of sadness that Rapin-Thoyras\r\nleft his native country. He left his widowed mother in profound grief,\r\narising from the recent death of her husband. She was now exposed to\r\npersecutions which were bitterer by far than the perils of exile. It\r\nwas at her express wish that Rapin left his native country and\r\nemigrated to England. And yet it was for France that his fathers had\r\nshed their blood and laid down their lives. But France now repelled\r\nthe descendants of her noblest sons from her bosom.\r\n\r\nShortly after his arrival in London, Rapin made the acquaintance of\r\nthe Abbé of Denbeck, nephew of the Bishop of Tournay. The Abbé was an\r\nintimate friend of Rapin's uncle, Pélisson, a man notorious in those\r\ntimes for buying up consciences with money. Louis XIV. consecrated to\r\nthis traffic one-third of the benefices which fell to the Crown during\r\ntheir vacancy. They were left vacant for the purpose of paying for the\r\nabjurations of the heretics. Pélisson had the administration of the\r\nfund. He had been born a Protestant, but he abjured his religion, and\r\nfrom a convert he became a converter. Voltaire says of him, in his\r\n\"Siècle de Louis XIV.,\" \"Much more a courtier than a philosopher,\r\nPélisson changed his religion and made a fortune.\"\r\n\r\nPélisson wrote to his friend the Abbé of Denbeck, then in London at\r\nthe court of James II., to look after his nephew Rapin-Thoyras, and\r\nendeavour to bring him over to the true faith. It is even said that\r\nPélisson offered Rapin the priory of Saint-Orens d'Auch if he would\r\nchange his religion. The Abbé did his best. He introduced Rapin to M.\r\nde Barillon, then ambassador at the English court. James II. was then\r\nthe pensioner of France, and accordingly had many intimate\r\ntransactions with the French ambassador. M. de Barillon received the\r\nyoung refugee with great kindness, and, at the recommendation of the\r\nAbbé and Pélisson, offered to present him to the King. Their object\r\nwas to get Rapin appointed to some public office, and thereby help his\r\nconversion.\r\n\r\nBut Rapin fled from the temptation. Though no great theologian, he\r\nfelt it to be wrong to be thus entrapped into a faith which was not\r\nhis own; and without much reasoning about his belief, but merely\r\nacting from a sense of duty, he left London at once and embarked for\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\nAt Utrecht he joined his uncle, Daniel de Rapin, who was in command of\r\na company of cadets wholly composed of Huguenot gentlemen and nobles.\r\nDaniel had left the service of France on the 25th of October, 1685,\r\nthree days after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. He was then\r\ncaptain of a French regiment in Picardy, but he could no longer,\r\nwithout denying his God, serve his country and his King. In fact, he\r\nwas compelled, like all other Protestant officers, to leave France\r\nunless he would at once conform to the King's faith.\r\n\r\nRapin was admitted to the company of refugee cadets commanded by his\r\nuncle. He was now twenty-seven years old. His first instincts had been\r\nmilitary, and now he was about to pursue the profession of arms in his\r\nadopted country. His first prospects were not brilliant. He was put\r\nunder a course of discipline, his pay amounting to only sixpence a\r\nday. Indeed, the States-General of Holland were at first unwilling to\r\ntake so large a number of refugee Frenchmen into their service; but on\r\nthe Prince of Orange publicly declaring that he would himself pay the\r\nexpenses of maintaining the military refugees, they hesitated no\r\nlonger, but voted money enough to enrol them in their service.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Orange had now a large body of troops at his command. No\r\none knew for what purpose they were enrolled. Some thought they were\r\nintended for an attack upon France in revenge for Louis' devastation\r\nof Holland a few years before. James II. never dreamt that they were\r\nintended for a descent upon the coasts of England. Yet he was rapidly\r\nalienating the loyalty of his subjects by hypocrisy, by infidelity to\r\nthe laws of England, and by unmitigated persecution of those who\r\ndiffered from him in religious belief. In this state of affairs\r\nEngland looked to the Prince of Orange for help.\r\n\r\nWilliam III. was doubly related to the royal family of England. He was\r\nnephew of Charles I. and son-in-law of James II. His wife was the\r\nheiress-presumptive to the British throne. Above all, he was a\r\nProtestant, while James II. was a Roman Catholic. \"Here,\" said the\r\nArchbishop of Rheims of the latter, \"is a good sort of man who has\r\nlost his three kingdoms for a mass!\"\r\n\r\nWilliam was at length ready with his troops. Louis XIV. suddenly\r\nwithdrew his army from Flanders and poured them into Germany. William\r\nseized the opportunity. A fleet of more than six hundred vessels,\r\nincluding fifty men-of-war, assembled at Helvoetsluys, near the mouth\r\nof the Maas. The troops were embarked with great celerity. William\r\nhoisted his flag with the words emblazoned on it, \"The Protestant\r\nReligion and Liberties of England,\" and underneath the motto of the\r\nHouse of Nassau, _Je maintiendra_--\"I will maintain.\"\r\n\r\nThe fleet set sail on the 19th October, the English Admiral Herbert\r\nleading the van, the Prince of Orange commanding the main body of the\r\nfleet, and the Dutch Vice-Admiral Evertzen bringing up the rear.\r\n\r\nThe wind was fair. It was the \"Protestant wind\" that the people of\r\nEngland had so long been looking for. In a few hours the strong\r\neastern breeze had driven the fleet half across the sea that divides\r\nthe Dutch and English coasts. Then the wind changed. It began to blow\r\nfrom the west. The wind increased until it blew a violent tempest. The\r\nfleet seemed to be in the midst of a cyclone. The ships were blown\r\nhither and thither, so that in less than two hours the fleet was\r\ncompletely dispersed. At daybreak next morning scarce two ships could\r\nbe seen together.\r\n\r\nThe several ships returned to their rendez-vous at Goeree, in the\r\nMaas. They returned in a miserable condition--some with their sails\r\nblown away, some without their bulwarks, some without their masts.\r\nMany ships were still missing. The horses had suffered severely. They\r\nhad been stowed away in the holds and driven against each other during\r\nthe storm. Many had been suffocated, others had their legs broken, and\r\nhad to be killed when the vessels reached the shore. The banks at\r\nGoeree were covered with dead horses taken from the ships. Four\r\nhundred had been lost.\r\n\r\nRapin de Thoyras and M. de Chavernay, commanding two companies of\r\nFrench Huguenots, were on board one of the missing ships. The\r\nfrightful tempest had separated them from the fleet. They had been\r\ndriven before the wind as far as the coast of Norway. They thought\r\nthat each moment might be their last. But the sailors were brave, and\r\nthe ship was manageable. After enduring a week's storm the wind at\r\nlast abated. The ship was tacked, and winged its way towards the\r\nsouth. At length, after about eight days' absence, they rejoined the\r\nfleet, which had again assembled in the Maas. There were now only two\r\nvessels missing, containing four companies of the Holstein regiment,\r\nand about sixty French Huguenot officers.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Prince of Orange had caused all the damages in the\r\ncombined fleet to be repaired. New horses were embarked, new men were\r\nadded to the army, and new ships were hired for the purpose of\r\naccommodating them. The men-of-war were also increased. After eleven\r\ndays the fleet was prepared to put to sea again.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of November, 1688, the armament started on its second\r\nvoyage for the English coast. The fleet at first steered northward,\r\nand it was thought to be the Prince's intention to land at the mouth\r\nof the Humber. But a violent east wind having begun to blow during the\r\nnight, the fleet steered towards the south-eastern coast of England;\r\nafter which the ships shortened sail for fear of accidents.\r\n\r\nThe same wind that blew the English and Dutch fleet towards the\r\nChannel, had the effect of keeping King James's fleet in the Thames,\r\nwhere they remained anchored at Gunfleet, sixty-one men-of-war, under\r\ncommand of Admiral Lord Dartmouth.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of November, the fleet under the Prince of Orange entered\r\nthe English Channel, and lay between Calais and Dover to wait for the\r\nships that were behind. \"It is easy,\" says Rapin Thoyras, \"to imagine\r\nwhat a glorious show the fleet made. Five or six hundred ships in so\r\nnarrow a channel, and both the English and French shores covered with\r\nnumberless spectators, are no common sight. For my part, who was then\r\non board the fleet, I own it struck me extremely.\"\r\n\r\nSunday, the 4th of November, was the Prince's birthday, and it was\r\ndedicated to devotion. The fleet was then off the Isle of Wight. Sail\r\nwas slackened during the performance of divine service. The fleet then\r\nsped on its way down-channel, in order that the troops might be landed\r\nat Dartmouth or Torbay; but during the night the wind freshened, and\r\nthe fleet was carried beyond the desired ports. Soon after, however,\r\nthe wind changed to the south, when the fleet tacked in splendid\r\norder, and made for the shore in Torbay. The landing was effected with\r\nsuch diligence and tranquillity that the whole army was on shore\r\nbefore night.\r\n\r\nThere was no opposition to the landing. King James's army greatly\r\noutnumbered that of the Prince of Orange. It amounted to about forty\r\nthousand troops, exclusive of the militia. But the King's forces had\r\nbeen sent northward to resist the anticipated landing of the\r\ndelivering army at the mouth of the Humber, so that the south-west of\r\nEngland was nearly stripped of troops.\r\n\r\nNor could the King depend upon his forces. The King had already\r\noutraged and insulted the gallant noblemen and gentlemen who had\r\nheretofore been the bulwark of his throne. He had imprisoned the\r\nbishops, dismissed Protestant clergymen from their livings, refused to\r\nsummon a Parliament, and caused terror and dismay throughout England\r\nand Scotland. He had created discontent throughout the army by his\r\ndismissal of Protestant officers, and the King now began to fear that\r\nthe common soldiers themselves would fail to serve him in his time of\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nHis fears proved prophetic. When the army of the Prince of Orange\r\nadvanced from Brixton (where it had landed) to Exeter, and afterwards\r\nto Salisbury and London, it was joined by noblemen, gentlemen,\r\nofficers, and soldiers. Lord Churchill, afterwards Duke of\r\nMarlborough, Lord Cornbury, with four regiments of dragoons, passed\r\nover to the Prince of Orange. The Prince of Denmark, the King's\r\nson-in-law, deserted him. His councillors abandoned him. His\r\nmistresses left him. The country was up against him. At length the\r\nKing saw no remedy before him but a precipitate flight.\r\n\r\nThe account given by Rapin of James's departure from England is\r\nsomewhat ludicrous. The Queen went first. On the night between the 9th\r\nand 10th of December she crossed the Thames in disguise. She waited\r\nunder the walls of a church at Lambeth until a coach could be got\r\nready for her at the nearest inn. She went from thence to Gravesend,\r\nwhere she embarked with the Prince of Wales on a small vessel, which\r\nconveyed them safely to France. The King set out on the following\r\nnight. He entered a small boat at Whitehall, dressed in a plain suit\r\nand a bob wig, accompanied by a few friends. He threw the Great Seal\r\ninto the water, from whence it was afterwards dragged up by a\r\nfisherman's net. Before he left, he gave the Earl of Feversham orders\r\nto disband the army without pay, in order, probably, to create anarchy\r\nafter his flight.\r\n\r\nJames reached the south shore of the Thames. He travelled, with relays\r\nof horses, to Emley Ferry, near the Island of Sheppey. He went on\r\nboard the little vessel that was to convey him to a French frigate\r\nlying in the mouth of the Thames ready to transport him to France. The\r\nwind blew strong, and the vessel was unable to sail.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen of the neighbourhood boarded the vessel in which the\r\nKing was. They took him for the chaplain of Sir Edward Hales, one of\r\nhis attendants. They searched the King, and found upon him four\r\nhundred guineas and several valuable seals and jewels, which they\r\nseized. A constable was present who knew the King, and he ordered\r\nrestitution of the valuables which had been taken from him. The King\r\nwished to be gone, but the people by a sort of violence conducted him\r\nto a public inn in the town of Feversham. He then sent for the Earl of\r\nWinchelsea, Lord-Lieutenant of the county, who prevailed upon him not\r\nto leave the kingdom, but to return to London.\r\n\r\nAnd to London he went. The Prince of Orange was by this time at\r\nWindsor. On the King's arrival in London he was received with\r\nacclamations, as if he had returned from victory. He resumed\r\npossession of his palace. He published a proclamation, announcing that\r\nhaving been given to understand that divers outrages had been\r\ncommitted in various parts of the kingdom, by burning, pulling down,\r\nand defacing of houses, he commanded all lord-lieutenants, &c., to\r\nprevent such outrages for the future, and suppress all riotous\r\nassemblies.\r\n\r\nThis was his last public act. He was without an army. He had few\r\nfriends. The Dutch Guards arrived in London, and took possession of\r\nSt. James's and Whitehall. The Prince of Orange sent three lords to\r\nthe King to desire his Majesty's departure for Ham--a house belonging\r\nto the Duchess of Lauderdale; but the King desired them to tell the\r\nPrince that he wished rather to go to Rochester. The Prince gave his\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\nNext morning the King entered his barge, accompanied by four earls,\r\nsix of the Yeomen of his Guard, and about a hundred of the Dutch\r\nGuard, commanded by a colonel of the regiment. They arrived at\r\nGravesend, where the King entered his coach, and proceeded across the\r\ncountry to Rochester.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Barillon, the French ambassador, was requested to\r\nleave England. St. Ledger, a French refugee, was requested to attend\r\nhim and see him embark. While they were on the road St. Ledger could\r\nnot forbear saying to the ambassador, \"Sir, had any one told you a\r\nyear ago that a French refugee should be commissioned to see you out\r\nof England, would you have believed it?\" To which the ambassador\r\nanswered, \"Sir, cross over with me to Calais, and I will give you an\r\nanswer.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after, James embarked in a small French ship, which landed him\r\nsafely at Ambleteuse, a few miles north of Boulogne; while the army of\r\nWilliam marched into London amidst loud congratulations, and William\r\nhimself took possession of the Palace of St. James's, which the\r\nrecreant King had left for his occupation.\r\n\r\nJames II. fled from England at the end of December, 1688. Louis XIV.\r\nreceived him courteously, and entertained him and his family at St.\r\nGermain and Versailles. But he could scarcely entertain much regard\r\nfor the abdicated monarch. James had left his kingdom in an\r\nignominious manner. Though he was at the head of a great fleet and\r\narmy, he had not struck a single blow in defence of his kingly rights\r\nAnd now he had come to the court of Louis XIV. to beg for the\r\nassistance of a French fleet and army to recover his throne.\r\n\r\nThough England had rejected James, Ireland was still in his favour.\r\nThe Lord-Deputy Tyrconnel was devoted to him; and the Irish people,\r\nexcepting those of the north, were ready to fight for him. About a\r\nhundred thousand Irishmen were in arms. Half were soldiers; the rest\r\nwere undrilled Rapparees. James was urged by messengers from Ireland\r\nto take advantage of this state of affairs. He accordingly begged\r\nLouis XIV. to send a French army with him into Ireland to help him to\r\nrecover his kingdom.\r\n\r\nBut the French monarch, who saw before him the prospect of a\r\ncontinental war, was unwilling to send a large body of troops out of\r\nhis kingdom. But he did what he could.\r\n\r\nHe ordered the Brest fleet to be ready. He put on board arms and\r\nammunition for ten thousand men. He selected four hundred French\r\nofficers for the purpose of disciplining the Irish levies. Count\r\nRosen, a veteran warrior, was placed in command. Over a hundred\r\nthousand pounds of money was also put on board. When the fleet was\r\nready to sail, James took leave of his patron, Louis XIV. \"The best\r\nthing that I can wish you,\" said the French king, \"is that I may never\r\nsee you again in this world.\"\r\n\r\nThe fleet sailed from Brest on the 7th of March, 1689, and reached\r\nKinsale, in the south of Ireland, four days later. James II. was\r\nreceived with the greatest rejoicing. Next day he went on to Cork; he\r\nwas received by the Earl of Tyrconnel, who caused one of the\r\nmagistrates to be executed because he had declared for the Prince of\r\nOrange.\r\n\r\nThe news went abroad that the King had landed. He entered Dublin on\r\nthe 24th of March, and was received in a triumphant manner. All Roman\r\nCatholic Ireland was at his feet. The Protestants in the south were\r\ndisarmed. There was some show of resistance in the north; but no doubt\r\nwas entertained that Enniskillen and Derry, where the Protestants had\r\ntaken refuge, would soon be captured and Protestantism crushed.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Orange, who had now been proclaimed King at Westminster,\r\nfound that he must fight for his throne, and that Ireland was to be\r\nthe battle-field. Londonderry was crowded with Protestants, who held\r\nout for William III. James believed that the place would fall without\r\na blow. Count Rosen was of the same opinion. The Irish army proceeded\r\nnorthwards without resistance. The country, as far as the walls of\r\nDerry, was found abandoned by the population. Everything valuable had\r\nbeen destroyed by bands of Rapparees. There was great want of food for\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, James proceeded as far as Derry. Confident of success,\r\nhe approached within a hundred yards of the southern gate, when he was\r\nreceived with a shout of \"No surrender!\" The cannon were fired from\r\nthe nearest bastion. One of James's officers was killed by his side.\r\nThen he fled. A few days later he was on his way to Dublin,\r\naccompanied by Count Rosen.\r\n\r\nLondonderry, after an heroic contest, was at length relieved. A fleet\r\nfrom England, laden with food, broke the boom which had been thrown by\r\nthe Irish army across the entrance to the harbour. The ships reached\r\nthe quay at ten o'clock at night. The whole population were there to\r\nreceive them. The food was unloaded, and the famished people were at\r\nlength fed. Three days after, the Irish army burnt their huts, and\r\nleft the long-beleaguered city. They retreated along the left bunk of\r\nthe Boyne to Strabane.\r\n\r\nWhile the Irish forces were lying there, the news of another disaster\r\nreached them. The Duke of Berwick lay with a strong detachment of\r\nIrish troops before Enniskillen. He had already gained some advantage\r\nover the Protestant colonists, and the command reached him from Dublin\r\nthat he was immediately to attack them. The Irish were five thousand\r\nin number; the Enniskilleners under three thousand.\r\n\r\nAn engagement took place at Newton Butler. The Enniskillen horse swept\r\nthe Irish troops before them. Fifteen hundred were put to the sword,\r\nand four hundred prisoners were taken. Seven pieces of cannon,\r\nfourteen barrels of powder, and all the drums and colours were left in\r\nthe hands of the victors. The Irish army were then at Strabane, on\r\ntheir retreat from Londonderry. They at once struck their tents, threw\r\ntheir military stores into the river, and set out in full retreat for\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a French fleet had landed at Bantry Bay, with three\r\nthousand men on board, and a large convoy of ammunition and\r\nprovisions. William III., on his part, determined, with the consent of\r\nthe English Parliament, to send a force into Ireland to encounter the\r\nFrench and Irish forces under King James.\r\n\r\nWilliam's troops consisted of English, Scotch, Dutch, and Danes, with\r\na large admixture of French Huguenots. There were a regiment of\r\nHuguenot horse, of eight companies, commanded by the Duke of\r\nSchomberg, and three regiments of Huguenot foot, commanded by La\r\nMellonière, Du Cambon, and La Caillemotte. Schomberg, the old Huguenot\r\nchief, was put in command of the entire force.\r\n\r\nRapin accompanied the expedition as a cadet. The army assembled at\r\nHighlake, about sixteen miles from Chester. About ninety vessels of\r\nall sorts were assembled near the mouth of the Dee. Part of the army\r\nwas embarked on the 12th of August, and set sail for Ireland. About\r\nten thousand men, horse and foot, were landed at Bangor, near the\r\nsouthern entrance to Belfast Lough. Parties were sent out to scour the\r\nadjacent country, and to feel for the enemy. This done, the army set\r\nout for Belfast.\r\n\r\nJames's forces had abandoned the place, and retired to Carrickfergus,\r\nsome ten miles from Belfast, on the north coast of the Lough.\r\nCarrickfergus was a fortified town. The castle occupies a strong\r\nposition on a rock overlooking the Lough. The place formed a depôt for\r\nJames's troops, and Schomberg therefore determined to besiege the\r\nfortress.\r\n\r\nRapin has written an account of William's campaigns in England and\r\nIreland; but with becoming modesty he says nothing about his own\r\nachievements. We must therefore supply the deficiency. Before the\r\nsiege of Carrickfergus, he had been appointed ensign in Lord\r\nKingston's regiment. He was helped to this office by his uncle Daniel,\r\nwho accompanied the expedition. Several regiments of Schomberg's army\r\nwere detached from Belfast to Carrickfergus, to commence the siege.\r\nAmong these was Lord Kingston's regiment.\r\n\r\nOn their approach, the enemy beat a parley. They desired to march out\r\nwith arms and baggage. Schomberg refused, and the siege began. The\r\ntrenches were opened, the batteries were raised, and the cannon\r\nthundered against the walls of the old town. Several breaches were\r\nmade. The attacks were pursued with great vigour for four days, when a\r\ngeneral assault was made. The besieged hoisted the white flag. After a\r\nparley, it was arranged that the Irish should surrender the place, and\r\nmarch out with their arms, and as much baggage as they could carry on\r\ntheir backs.\r\n\r\nCarrickfergus was not taken without considerable loss to the\r\nbesiegers. Lieutenant Briset, of the Flemish Guards, was killed by the\r\nfirst shot fired from the castle. The Marquis de Venours was also\r\nkilled while leading the Huguenot regiments to the breach. Rapin\r\ndistinguished himself so much during the siege that he was promoted\r\nto the rank of lieutenant. He was at the same time transferred to\r\nanother regiment, and served under Lieutenant-General Douglas during\r\nthe rest of the campaign.\r\n\r\nMore troops having arrived from England, Schomberg marched with his\r\naugmented army to Lisburn, Drummore, and Loughbrickland. Here the\r\nEnniskillen Horse joined them, and offered to be the advanced guard of\r\nthe army. The Enniskilleners were a body of irregular horsemen, of\r\nsingularly wild and uncouth appearance. They rode together in a\r\nconfused body, each man being attended by a mounted servant, bearing\r\nhis baggage. The horsemen were each mounted and accoutred after their\r\nown fashion, without any regular dress, or arms, or mode of attack.\r\nThey only assumed a hasty and confused line when about to rush into\r\naction. They fell on pell-mell. Yet they were the bravest of the\r\nbrave, and were never deterred from attacking by inequality of\r\nnumbers. They were attended by their favourite preachers, who urged\r\nthem on to deeds of valour, and encouraged them \"to purge the land of\r\nidolatry.\"\r\n\r\nThus reinforced, Schomberg pushed on to Newry. The Irish were in force\r\nthere, under command of the Duke of Berwick. But although it was a\r\nvery strong place, the Irish abandoned the town, first setting fire to\r\nit. This news having been brought to Schomberg, he sent a trumpet to\r\nthe Duke of Berwick, acquainting him that if they went on to burn\r\ntowns in that barbarous manner, he would give no quarter. This notice\r\nseems to have had a good effect, for on quitting Dundalk the\r\nretreating army did no harm to the town. Schomberg encamped about a\r\nmile north of Dundalk, in a low, moist ground, where he entrenched his\r\narmy. Count Rosen was then at Drogheda with about twenty thousand\r\nmen, far outnumbering the forces under Schomberg.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of September, King James's army approached the lines of\r\nDundalk. They drew up in order of battle. The English officers were\r\nfor attacking the enemy, but Schomberg advised them to refrain. A\r\nlarge party of horse appeared within cannon shot, but they made no\r\nfurther attempt. In a day or two after James drew off his army to\r\nArdee, Count Rosen indignantly exclaiming, \"If your Majesty had ten\r\nkingdoms, you would lose them all.\" In the meantime, Schomberg\r\nremained entrenched in his camp. The Enniskilleners nevertheless made\r\nvarious excursions, and routed a body of James's troops marching\r\ntowards Sligo.\r\n\r\nGreat distress fell upon Schomberg's army. The marshy land on which\r\nthey were encamped, the wet and drizzly weather, the scarcity and\r\nbadness of the food, caused a raging sickness to break out. Great\r\nnumbers were swept away by disease. Among the officers who died were\r\nSir Edward Deering, of Kent; Colonel Wharton, son of Lord Wharton; Sir\r\nThomas Gower and Colonel Hungerford, two young gentlemen of\r\ndistinguished merit. Two thousand soldiers died in the camp. Many\r\nafterwards perished from cold and hunger. Schomberg at length left the\r\ncamp at Dundalk, and the remains of his army went into winter\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nRapin shared all the suffering of the campaign. When the army\r\nretreated northward, Rapin was sent with a party of soldiers to occupy\r\na fortified place between Stranorlar and Donegal. It commanded the\r\nPass of Barnes Gap. This is perhaps the most magnificent defile in\r\nIreland. It is about four miles long. Huge mountains rise on either\r\nside. The fortalice occupied by Rapin is now in ruins. It stands on a\r\nheight overlooking the northern end of the pass. It is now called\r\nBarrack Hill. The Rapparees who lived at the lower end of the Gap were\r\naccustomed to come down upon the farming population of the lowland\r\ncountry on the banks of the rivers Finn and Mourne, and carry off all\r\nthe cattle that they could seize; Rapin was accordingly sent with a\r\nbody of troops to defend the lowland farmers from the Rapparees.\r\nBesides, it was found necessary to defend the pass against the forces\r\nof King James, who then occupied Sligo and the neighbouring towns,\r\nunder the command of General Sarsfield.\r\n\r\nSchomberg was very much blamed by the English Parliament for having\r\neffected nothing decisive in Ireland. But what could he do? He had to\r\noppose an army more than three times stronger in numbers than his own.\r\nKing William, Rapin says, wrote twice to him, \"pressing him to put\r\nsomewhat to the venture.\" But his army was wasted by disease, and had\r\nhe volunteered an encounter and been defeated, his whole army, and\r\nconsequently all Ireland, would have been lost, for he could not have\r\nmade a regular retreat. \"His sure way,\" says Rapin, \"was to preserve\r\nhis army, and that would save Ulster and keep matters entire for\r\nanother year. And therefore, though this conduct of his was blamed by\r\nsome, yet better judges thought that the managing of this campaign as\r\nhe did was one of the greatest parts of his life.\"\r\n\r\nWinter passed. Nothing decisive had been accomplished on either side.\r\nPart of Ulster was in the hands of William; the remainder of Ireland\r\nwas in the hands of James. Schomberg's army was wasted by famine and\r\ndisease. James made no use of his opportunity to convert his athletic\r\npeasants into good soldiers. On the contrary, Schomberg recruited his\r\nold regiments, drilled them constantly, and was ready to take the\r\nfield at the approach of spring.\r\n\r\nHis first achievement was the capture of Charlemont, midway between\r\nArmagh and Dungannon. It was one of the strongest forts in the north\r\nof Ireland. It overlooked the Blackwater, and commanded an important\r\npass. It was surrounded by a morass, and approachable only by two\r\nnarrow causeways. When Teague O'Regan, who commanded the fort, was\r\nsummoned to surrender, he replied, \"Schomberg is an old rogue, and\r\nshall not have this castle!\" But Caillemotte, with his Huguenot\r\nregiments, sat down before the fortress, and starved the garrison into\r\nsubmission. Captain Francis Rapin, cousin of our hero, was killed\r\nduring the siege.\r\n\r\nThe armies on both sides were now receiving reinforcements. Louis XIV.\r\nsent seven thousand two hundred and ninety men of all ranks to the\r\nhelp of James, under the command of Count Lauzun. They landed at Cork\r\nin March, 1689, and marched at once to Dublin. Lauzun described the\r\ncountry as a chaos such as he had read of in the Book of Genesis. On\r\nhis arrival at Dublin, Lauzun was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nIrish army, and took up his residence in the castle.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Schomberg's forces were recruited by seven thousand\r\nDanes, under a treaty which William III. had entered into with the\r\nKing of Denmark. New detachments of English and Scotch, of Huguenots,\r\nDutch, Flemings, and Brandenburgers, were also added to the allied\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nWilliam landed at Carrickfergus on the 14th of June. He passed on to\r\nBelfast, where he met Schomberg, the Prince of Wurtemberg,\r\nMajor-General Kirk, and other general officers. He then pushed on to\r\nLisburn, the head-quarters of his army. He there declared that he\r\nwould not let the grass grow under his feet, but would pursue the war\r\nwith the utmost vigour. He ordered the whole army to assemble at\r\nLoughbrickland. He found them to consist of sixty-two squadrons of\r\ncavalry and fifty-two battalions of infantry--in all, thirty-six\r\nthousand English, Dutch, French, Danes, and Germans, well appointed in\r\nevery respect. Lieutenant-General Douglas commanded the\r\nadvance-guard--to which Rapin belonged--and William III., Schomberg,\r\nand St. Gravenmore commanded the main body.\r\n\r\nWilliam III. had no hesitation in entering at once on the campaign. He\r\nhad been kept too long in London by parliamentary turmoil, by\r\nintrigues between Whigs and Tories, and sometimes by treachery on both\r\nsides. But now that he was in the field his spirits returned, and he\r\ndetermined to lose not a day in measuring swords with his enemy. He\r\nhad very little time to spare. He must lose or win his crown; though\r\nhis determination was to win. Accordingly he marched southward without\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nWilliam had been in Ireland six days before James knew of his arrival.\r\nThe passes between Newry and Dundalk had been left unguarded--passes\r\nwhere a small body of well-disciplined troops might easily have\r\nchecked the advance of William's army. Dundalk was abandoned. Ardee\r\nwas abandoned. The Irish army were drawn up in a strong position on\r\nthe south of the Boyne to arrest the progress of the invading army.\r\nJames had all the advantages that nature could give him. He had a deep\r\nriver in front, a morass on his left, and the narrow bridge of Slane\r\non his right. Behind was a rising ground stretching along the whole of\r\nthe field. In the rear lay the church and village of Donore, and the\r\nPass of Duleek. Drogheda lay towards the mouth of the river, where the\r\ngreen and white flags of Ireland and France were flying, emblazoned\r\nwith the harp and the lilies.\r\n\r\nWilliam never halted until he reached the summit of a rising ground\r\noverlooking the beautiful valley of the Boyne. It is about the most\r\nfertile ground in Ireland. As he looked from east to west, William\r\nsaid to one of his staff, \"Behold a land worth fighting for!\" Rapin\r\nwas there, and has told the story of the crossing of the Boyne. He\r\nsays that the forces of King James, lying on the other side of the\r\nriver, amounted to about the same number as those under King William.\r\nThey included more than seven thousand veteran French soldiers. There\r\nwas a splendid body of Irish horse, and about twenty thousand Irish\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nJames's officers were opposed to a battle; they wished to wait for the\r\nlarge fleet and the additional forces promised by Louis XIV. But James\r\nresolved to maintain his position, and thought that he might have one\r\nfair battle for his crown. \"But,\" says Rapin, \"notwithstanding all his\r\nadvantages--the deep river in front, the morass on his right, and the\r\nrising ground behind him--he ordered a ship to be prepared for him at\r\nWaterford, that in case of a defeat he might secure his retreat to\r\nFrance.\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 30th of June, William ordered his whole army to\r\nmove by break of day by three lines towards the river, about three\r\nmiles distant. The King marched in front. By nine o'clock they were\r\nwithin two miles of Drogheda. Observing a hill east of the enemy, the\r\nKing rode up to view the enemy's camp. He found it to lie all along\r\nthe river in two lines. Here he had a long consultation with his\r\nleading officers. He then rode to the pass at Old Bridge, within\r\nmusket-shot of the ford; next he rode westward, so as to take a full\r\nview of the enemy's camp. He fixed the place where his batteries were\r\nto be planted, and decided upon the spot where his army was to cross\r\nthe river on the following day.\r\n\r\nThe Irish on the other side of the river had not been unobservant of\r\nthe King's movements. They could see him riding up and down the banks,\r\nfor they were not sixty yards apart. The Duke of Berwick, the Viceroy\r\nTyrconnel, General Sarsfield, and other officers were carefully\r\nwatching his movements. While the army was marching up the river-side,\r\nWilliam dismounted and sat down upon a rising ground to partake of\r\nsome refreshments, for he had been on horseback since early dawn.\r\nDuring this time a party of Irish horse on the other side brought\r\nforward two field-pieces through a ploughed field, and planted them\r\nbehind a hedge. They took their sight and fired. The first shot killed\r\na man and two horses close by the King. William immediately mounted\r\nhis horse. The second gun was not so well aimed. The shot struck the\r\nwater, but rising _en ricochet_, it slanted on the King's right\r\nshoulder, took a piece out of his coat, and tore the skin and the\r\nflesh. William rode away stooping in his saddle. The Earl of Coningsby\r\nput a handkerchief over the wound, but William said \"there was no\r\nnecessity, the bullet should have come nearer.\"\r\n\r\nThe enemy, seeing the discomfiture of the King's party, and that he\r\nrode away wounded, spread abroad the news that he was killed. \"They\r\nimmediately,\" says Rapin, \"set up a shout all over their camp, and\r\ndrew down several squadrons of their horse upon a plain towards the\r\nriver, as if they meant to pass and pursue the English army. Nay, the\r\nreport of the King's death flew presently to Dublin, and from thence\r\nspread as far as Paris, where the people were encouraged to express\r\ntheir joy by bonfires and illuminations.\" In the meantime William\r\nreturned to his tent, where he had his wound dressed, and again\r\nmounted and showed himself to the whole army, in order to dissipate\r\ntheir apprehensions. He remained on horseback until nine at night,\r\nthough he had been up since one o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nWilliam then called a council of war, and declared his resolution of\r\nforcing the river next day. Schomberg opposed this, but finding the\r\nKing determined, he urged that a strong body of horse and foot should\r\nbe sent to Slane bridge that night, so as to be able to cross the\r\nbridge and get between the enemy and the Pass of Duleek, which lay\r\nbehind King James's army. This advice, if followed, might perhaps have\r\nended the war in one campaign. Such is Rapin's opinion. The proposal\r\nwas, however, rejected; and it was determined to cross the river in\r\nforce on the following morning. William inspected the troops at\r\nmidnight. He rode along the whole army by torchlight, and after giving\r\nout the password \"Westminster,\" he returned to his tent for a few\r\nhours' sleep.\r\n\r\nThe shades of night lay still over that sleeping host. The stars\r\nlooked down in peace on these sixty thousand brethren of the same\r\nhuman family, ready to rise with the sun and imbrue their hands in\r\neach other's blood. Tyrannical factions and warring creeds had set\r\nthem at enmity with each other, and turned the sweetness and joy of\r\ntheir nature into gall and bitterness. The night was quiet. The murmur\r\nof the river fell faintly on the ear. A few trembling lights gleamed\r\nthrough the dark from the distant watchtowers of Drogheda. The only\r\nsounds that rose from the vast host that lay encamped in the valley of\r\nthe Boyne were the challenges of the sentinels to each other as they\r\npaced their midnight rounds.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose clear and beautiful. It was the first day of July--a day\r\nfor ever memorable in the history of Ireland as well as England. The\r\n_générale_ was beat in the camp of William before daybreak, and as\r\nsoon as the sun was up the battle began. Lieutenant-General Douglas\r\nmarched towards the right with six battalions of foot, accompanied by\r\nCount Schomberg (son of the Marshal) with twenty-four squadrons of\r\nhorse. They crossed the river below the bridge of Slane, and though\r\nopposed by the Irish, they drove them back and pressed them on towards\r\nDuleek.\r\n\r\nWhen it was supposed that the left wing had crossed the Boyne, the\r\nDutch Blue Guards, beating a march till they reached the river's edge,\r\nwent in eight or ten abreast, the water reaching above their girdles.\r\nWhen they had gained the centre of the stream they were saluted with a\r\ntremendous fire from the Irish foot, protected by the breastworks,\r\nlanes, and hedges on the farther side of the river. Nevertheless they\r\npushed on, formed in two lines, and drove the Irish before them.\r\nSeveral Irish battalions were brought to bear upon them, but without\r\neffect. Then a body of Irish cavalry assailed them, but still they\r\nheld their ground.\r\n\r\nWilliam, seeing his troops hardly pressed, sent across two Huguenot\r\nregiments and one English regiment to their assistance. But a regiment\r\nof Irish dragoons, at the moment of their reaching the shore, fell\r\nupon their flank, broke their ranks, and put many of them to the\r\nsword. Colonel Caillemotte, leader of the Huguenots, received a mortal\r\nwound. He was laid on a litter and carried to the rear. As he met his\r\nmen coming up to the help of their comrades, he called out, \"A la\r\ngloire, mes enfants! à la gloire!\" A squadron of Danish horse forded\r\nthe river, but the Irish dragoons, in one of their dashing charges,\r\nbroke and defeated them, and drove them across the river in great\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nDuke Schomberg, who was in command of the centre, seeing that the day\r\nwas going against King William, and that the French Huguenots were\r\nfighting without their leader, crossed the river and put himself at\r\ntheir head. Pointing to the Frenchmen in James's ranks, he cried out\r\nto his men, \"Allons, messieurs, voilà vos persécuteurs!\" The words\r\nwere scarcely out of his mouth when a troop of James's guards,\r\nreturning full speed to their main body, fell furiously upon the Duke\r\nand inflicted two sword cuts upon his head. The regiment of Cambon\r\nbegan at once to fire upon the enemy, but by a miss shot they hit the\r\nDuke. \"They shot the Duke,\" says Rapin, \"through the neck, of which he\r\ninstantly died, and M. Foubert, alighting to receive him, was shot in\r\nthe arm.\"\r\n\r\nThe critical moment had arrived. The centre of William's army was in\r\nconfusion. Their leaders, Schomberg and Caillemotte, were killed. The\r\nmen were waiting for orders. They were exposed to the galling fire of\r\nthe Irish infantry and cavalry. King James was in the rear on the hill\r\nof Dunmore surrounded by his French body-guard. He was looking down\r\nupon the field of battle, viewing now here, now there. It is even said\r\nthat when he saw the Irish dragoons routing the cavalry and riding\r\ndown the broken infantry of William, he exclaimed, \"Spare! oh, spare\r\nmy English subjects!\"\r\n\r\nThe firing had now lasted uninterruptedly for more than an hour, when\r\nWilliam seized the opportunity of turning the tide of battle against\r\nhis spiritless adversary. Putting himself at the head of the left\r\nwing, he crossed the Boyne by a dangerous and difficult ford a little\r\nlower down the river; his cavalry for the most part swimming across\r\nthe tide. The ford had been left unguarded, and the whole soon reached\r\nthe opposite bank in safety. But even there the horse which William\r\nrode sank in a bog, and he was forced to alight until the horse was\r\ngot out. He was helped to remount, for the wound in his shoulder was\r\nvery painful. So soon as the troops were got into sufficient order,\r\nWilliam drew his sword, though his wound made it uneasy for him to\r\nwield it. He then marched on towards the enemy.\r\n\r\nWhen the Irish saw themselves menaced by William's left wing, they\r\nhalted, and retired towards Dunmore. But gaining courage, they faced\r\nabout and fell upon the English horse. They gave way. The King then\r\nrode up to the Enniskilleners, and asked, \"What they would do for\r\nhim?\" Not knowing him, the men were about to shoot him, thinking him\r\nto be one of the enemy. But when their chief officer told them that it\r\nwas the King who wanted their help, they at once declared their\r\nintention of following him. They marched forward and received the\r\nenemy's fire. The Dutch troops came up, at the head of whom William\r\nplaced himself. \"In this place,\" says Rapin, \"Duke Schomberg's\r\nregiment of horse, composed of French Protestants, and strengthened by\r\nan unusual number of officers, behaved with undaunted resolution, like\r\nmen who fought for a nation amongst whom themselves and their friends\r\nhad found shelter against the persecution of France.\"\r\n\r\nGinckel's troops now arrived on the scene; but they were overpowered\r\nby the Irish horse, and forced to give way. Sir Albert Cunningham's\r\nand Colonel Levison's dragoons then came up, and enabled Ginckel's\r\ntroops to rally; and the Irish were driven up the hill, after an\r\nhour's hard fighting. James's lieutenant-general, Hamilton, was taken\r\nprisoner and brought before the King. He was asked \"Whether the Irish\r\nwould fight any more?\" \"Yes,\" he answered; \"upon my honour I believe\r\nthey will.\" The Irish slowly gave way, their dragoons charging again\r\nand again, to cover the retreat of the foot. At Dunmore they made a\r\ngallant stand, driving back the troops of William several times. The\r\nfarmstead of Sheephouse was taken and retaken again and again.\r\n\r\nAt last the Irish troops slowly retreated up the hill. The French\r\ntroops had scarcely been engaged. Sarsfield implored James to put\r\nhimself at their head, and make a last fight for his crown. Six\r\nthousand fresh men coming into action, when the army of William was\r\nexhausted by fatigue, might have changed the fortune of the day. But\r\nJames would not face the enemy. He put himself at the head of the\r\nFrench troops and Sarsfield's regiment--the first occasion on which he\r\nhad led during the day--and set out for Dublin, leaving the rest of\r\nhis army to shift for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Irish army now poured through the Pass of Duleek. They were\r\npursued by Count Schomberg at the head of the left wing of William's\r\narmy. The pursuit lasted several miles beyond the village of Duleek,\r\nwhen the Count was recalled by express orders of the King. The Irish\r\narmy retreated in good order, and they reached Dublin in safety. James\r\nwas the first to carry thither the news of his defeat. On reaching\r\nDublin Castle, he was received by Lady Tyrconnel, the wife of the\r\nViceroy. \"Madam,\" said he, \"your countrymen can run well.\" \"Not quite\r\nso well as your Majesty,\" was her retort, \"for I see that you have won\r\nthe race.\"\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the Irish soldiers may be understood from their saying,\r\nafter their defeat, \"Change generals, and we will fight the battle\r\nover again.\" \"James had no royal quality about him,\" says an able\r\nCatholic historian; \"nature had made him a coward, a monk, and a\r\ngourmand; and, in spite of the freak of fortune that had placed him on\r\na throne, and seemed inclined to keep him there, she vindicated her\r\nauthority, and dropped him ultimately in the niche that suited him--\r\n\r\n  'The meanest slave of France's despot lord.'\"\r\n\r\nWilliam halted on the field that James had occupied in the morning.\r\nThe troops remained under arms all night. The loss of life was not so\r\ngreat as was expected. On William's side not more than four hundred\r\nmen were killed; but amongst them were Duke Schomberg, Colonel\r\nCaillemotte, and Dr. George Walker, the defender of Derry. \"King\r\nJames's whole loss in this battle,\" says Rapin, \"was generally\r\ncomputed at fifteen hundred men, amongst whom were the Lord Dungan,\r\nthe Lord Carlingford, Sir Neil O'Neil, Colonel Fitzgerald, the Marquis\r\nd'Hocquincourt, and several prisoners, the chief of whom was\r\nLieutenant-General Hamilton, who, to do him justice, behaved with\r\ngreat courage, and kept the victory doubtful, until he was taken\r\nprisoner.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day Drogheda surrendered without resistance. The\r\ngarrison laid down their arms, and departed for Athlone. James stayed\r\nat Dublin for a night, and on the following morning he started for\r\nWaterford, causing the bridges to be broken down behind him, for fear\r\nof being pursued by the allied forces. He then embarked on a\r\nship-of-war, and was again conveyed to France.\r\n\r\nWilliam's army proceeded slowly to Dublin. The Duke of Ormond entered\r\nthe city two days after the battle of the Boyne, at the head of nine\r\ntroops of horse. On the next day the King, with his whole army,\r\nmarched to Finglas, in the neighbourhood of Dublin; and on the 6th of\r\nJuly he entered the city, and proceeded to St. Patrick's Church, to\r\nreturn thanks for his victory.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Irish army proceeded towards Athlone and Limerick,\r\nintending to carry on the war behind the Shannon. William sent a body\r\nof his troops, under Lieutenant-General Douglas, to Athlone, while he\r\nhimself proceeded to reduce and occupy the towns of the South. Rapin\r\nfollowed his leader, and hence his next appearance at the siege of\r\nAthlone.\r\n\r\nRapin conducted himself throughout the Irish campaign as a true soldier.\r\nHe was attentive, accurate, skilful, and brave. He did the work he had\r\nto do without any fuss; but he _did_ it. Lieutenant-General Douglas,\r\nunder whom he served, soon ascertained his merits, saw through his\r\ncharacter, and became much attached to him. He promoted him to the rank\r\nof aide-de-camp, so that he might have this able Frenchman continually\r\nabout his person.\r\n\r\nDouglas proceeded westward, with six regiments of horse and ten of\r\nfoot, to reduce Athlone. But the place was by far too strong for so\r\nsmall a force to besiege, and still less to take it. Athlone had\r\nalways been a stronghold. For centuries the bridge and castle had\r\nformed the great highway into Connaught. The Irish town is defended on\r\nthe eastern side by the Shannon, a deep and wide river, almost\r\nimpossible to pass in the face of a hostile army.\r\n\r\nDouglas summoned the Irish garrison to surrender. Colonel Richard\r\nGrace, the gallant old governor, returned a passionate defiance.\r\n\"These are my terms,\" he said, discharging a pistol at the messenger:\r\n\"when my provisions are consumed, I will defend my trust until I have\r\neaten my boots.\"\r\n\r\nAbandoning as indefensible the English part of the town, situated on\r\nthe east side of the Shannon, Grace set fire to it, and retired with\r\nall his forces to the western side, blowing up an arch of the bridge\r\nbehind him. The English then brought up the few cannon they had with\r\nthem, and commenced battering the walls. The Irish had more cannon,\r\nand defended themselves with vigour. The besiegers made a breach in\r\nthe castle, but it was too high and too small for an assault.\r\n\"Notwithstanding this,\" says Rapin, \"the firing continued very brisk\r\non both sides; but the besiegers having lost Mr. Neilson, their best\r\ngunner, and the cavalry suffering very much for want of forage; and at\r\nthe same time it being reported that Sarsfield was advancing with\r\nfifteen thousand men to relieve the place, Douglas held a council of\r\nwar, wherein it was thought fit to raise the siege, which he\r\naccordingly did on the 25th, having lost near four hundred men before\r\nthe town, the greatest part of whom died of sickness.\"\r\n\r\nThus, after a week's ineffectual siege, Douglas left Athlone, and made\r\nall haste to rejoin the army of William, which had already reduced the\r\nmost important towns in the south of Ireland. On the 7th of August he\r\nrejoined William at Cahirconlish, a few miles west of Limerick. The\r\nflower of the Irish army was assembled at Limerick. The Duke of\r\nBerwick and General Sarsfield occupied the city with their forces. The\r\nFrench general, Boileau, commanded the garrison. The besieged were\r\nalmost as numerous as the besiegers. William, by garrisoning the towns\r\nof which he took possession, had reduced his forces to about twenty\r\nthousand men.\r\n\r\nLimerick was fortified by walls, batteries, and ramparts. It was also\r\ndefended by a castle and citadel. It had always been a place of great\r\nstrength. The chivalry of the Anglo-Norman monarch, the Ironsides of\r\nCromwell, had been defeated under its walls; and now the victorious\r\narmy of William III. was destined to meet with a similar repulse.\r\n\r\nLimerick is situated in an extensive plain, watered by the noble\r\nShannon. The river surrounds the town on three sides. Like Athlone,\r\nthe city is divided into the English and Irish towns, connected\r\ntogether by a bridge. The English town was much the strongest. It was\r\nbuilt upon an island, surrounded by morasses, which could at any time\r\nbe flooded on the approach of an enemy. The town was well supplied\r\nwith provisions--all Clare and Galway being open to it, from whence\r\nit could draw supplies.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the strength of the fortress, William resolved to\r\nbesiege it. He was ill supplied with cannon, having left his heavy\r\nartillery at Dublin. He had only a field train with him, which was\r\nquite insufficient for his purpose. William's advance-guards drove the\r\nIrish outposts before them; the pioneers cutting down the hedges and\r\nfilling up the ditches, until they came to a narrow pass between two\r\nbogs, where a considerable body of Irish horse and foot were assembled\r\nto dispute the pass.\r\n\r\nTwo field-pieces were brought up, which played with such effect upon\r\nthe Irish horse that they soon quitted their post. At the same time\r\nColonel Earle, at the head of the English foot, attacked the Irish who\r\nwere firing through the hedges, so that they also retired after two\r\nhours' fighting. The Irish were driven to the town walls, and\r\nWilliam's forces took possession of two important positions,\r\nCromwell's fort and the old Chapel. The Danes also occupied an old\r\nDanish fort, built by their ancestors, of which they were not a little\r\nproud.\r\n\r\nThe army being thus posted, a trumpeter was sent, on the 9th of\r\nAugust, to summon the garrison to surrender. General Boileau answered,\r\nthat he intended to make a vigorous defence of the town with which his\r\nMajesty had intrusted him. In the meantime, William had ordered up his\r\ntrain of artillery from Dublin. They were on their way to join him,\r\nwhen a spy from William's camp went over to the enemy, and informed\r\nthem of the route, the motions, and the strength of the convoy.\r\nSarsfield at once set out with a strong body of horse. He passed the\r\nShannon in the night, nine miles above Limerick, lurked all day in\r\nthe mountains near Ballyneety, and waited for the approach of the\r\nconvoy.\r\n\r\nThe men of William's artillery, seeing no enemy, turned out their\r\nhorses to graze, and went to sleep in the full sense of security.\r\nSarsfield's body of horse came down upon them, slew or dispersed the\r\nconvoy, and took possession of the cannon. Sarsfield could not,\r\nhowever, take the prizes into Limerick. He therefore endeavoured to\r\ndestroy them. Cramming the guns with powder up to their muzzles, and\r\nburying their mouths deep in the earth, then piling the stores,\r\nwaggons, carriages, and baggage over them, he laid a train and fired\r\nit, just as Sir John Lanier, with a body of cavalry, was arriving to\r\nrescue the convoy. The explosion was tremendous, and was heard at the\r\ncamp of William, more than seven miles off. Sarsfield's troops\r\nreturned to Limerick in triumph.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these grievous discouragements, William resolved to\r\npersevere. He recovered two of the guns, which remained uninjured. He\r\nobtained others from Waterford. The trenches were opened on the 17th\r\nof August. A battery was raised below the fort to the right of the\r\ntrenches. Firing went on on both sides. Several redoubts were taken.\r\nBy the 25th, the trenches were advanced to within thirty paces of the\r\nditch near St. John's Gate, and a breach was made in the walls about\r\ntwelve yards wide.\r\n\r\nThe assault was ordered to take place on the 27th. The English\r\ngrenadiers took the lead, supported by a hundred French officers and\r\nvolunteers. The enemy were dislodged from the covered way and the two\r\nforts which guarded the breach on each side. The assailants entered\r\nthe breach, but they were not sufficiently supported. The Irish\r\nrallied. They returned to the charge, helped by the women, who pelted\r\nthe besiegers with stones, broken bottles, and such other missiles as\r\ncame readily to hand. A Brandenburg regiment having assailed and taken\r\nthe Black Battery, it was blown up by an explosion, which killed many\r\nof the men. In fine, the assault was vigorously repulsed; and\r\nWilliam's troops retreated to the main body, with a loss of six\r\nhundred men killed on the spot and as many mortally wounded.\r\n\r\nRapin was severely wounded. A musket shot hit him in the shoulder, and\r\ncompletely disabled him. His brother Solomon was also wounded. His\r\nyounger brother fell dead by his side. They belonged to the \"forlorn\r\nhope,\" and were volunteers in the assault on the breach. Rapin was\r\nraised to the rank of captain.\r\n\r\nThe siege of Limerick was at once raised. The heavy baggage and cannon\r\nwere sent away on the 30th of August, and the next day the army\r\ndecamped and marched towards Clonmel. The King intrusted the command\r\nof his army to Lieutenant-General Ginckel, and set sail for England\r\nfrom Duncannon Fort, near Waterford, on the 5th of September.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was not yet over. The Earl of Marlborough landed near\r\nCork with four thousand men. Reinforced by four thousand Danes and\r\nFrench Huguenots, he shortly succeeded in taking the fortified towns\r\nof Cork and Kinsale. After garrisoning these places the Earl returned\r\nto England.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ginckel went into winter quarters at Mullingar, in Westmeath.\r\nThe French troops, under command of Count Lauzun, went into Galway.\r\nLauzun shortly after returned to France, and St. Ruth was sent over to\r\ntake command of the French and Irish army. But they hung about Galway\r\ndoing nothing. In the meantime Ginckel was carefully preparing for the\r\nrenewal of the campaign. He was reinforced by an excellent body of\r\ntroops from Scotland, commanded by General Mackay. He was also well\r\nsupplied, through the vigilance of William, with all the necessaries\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nRapin's friend, Colonel Lord Douglas, pressed him to accompany him to\r\nFlanders as his aide-de-camp; but the wound in his shoulder still\r\ncaused him great pain, and he was forced to decline the appointment.\r\nStrange to say, his uncle Pélisson--the converter, or rather the\r\nbuyer, of so many Romish converts in France--sent him a present of\r\nfifty pistoles through his cousin M. de la Bastide, which consoled him\r\ngreatly during his recovery.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ginckel broke up his camp at Mullingar at the beginning of\r\nJune, and marched towards Athlone. The Irish had assembled a\r\nconsiderable army at Ballymore, about midway between Mullingar and\r\nAthlone. They had also built a fort there, and intended to dispute the\r\npassage of Ginckel's army. A sharp engagement took place when his\r\nforces came up. The Irish were defeated, with the loss of over a\r\nthousand prisoners and all their baggage.\r\n\r\nGinckel then appeared before Athlone, but the second resistance of the\r\nbesieged was much less successful than the first. St. Ruth, the French\r\ngeneral, treated the Irish officers and soldiers under his command\r\nwith supercilious contempt. He admitted none of their officers into\r\nhis councils. He was as ignorant of the army which he commanded as of\r\nthe country which he occupied. Nor was he a great general. He had been\r\nprincipally occupied in France in hunting and hanging the poor\r\nProtestants of Dauphiny and the Cevennes. He had never fought a\r\npitched battle; and his incapacity led to the defeat of the Irish at\r\nAthlone, and afterwards at Aughrim.\r\n\r\nSt. Ruth treated his English adversaries with as much contempt as he\r\ndid his Irish followers. When he heard that the English were about to\r\ncross the Shannon, he said \"it was impossible for them to take the\r\ntown, and be so near with an army to succour it.\" He added that he\r\nwould give a thousand louis if they _durst_ attempt it. To which\r\nSarsfield retorted, \"Spare your money and mind your business; for I\r\nknow that no enterprise is too difficult for British courage to\r\nattempt.\"\r\n\r\nGinckel took possession of the English town after some resistance,\r\nwhen the Irish army retreated to the other side of the Shannon.\r\nBatteries were planted, pontoons were brought up, and the siege began\r\nwith vigour. Ginckel attempted to get possession of the bridge. One of\r\nthe arches was broken down, on the Connaught side of the river. Under\r\ncover of a heavy fire, a party of Ginckel's men succeeded in raising a\r\nplank-work for the purpose of spanning the broken arch. The work was\r\nnearly completed, when a sergeant and ten bold Scots belonging to\r\nMaxwell's Brigade on the Irish side, pushed on to the bridge; but they\r\nwere all slain. A second brave party was more successful than the\r\nfirst. They succeeded in throwing all the planks and beams into the\r\nriver, only two men escaping with their lives.\r\n\r\nGinckel then attempted to repair the broken arch by carrying a close\r\ngallery on the bridge, in order to fill up the gap with heavy planks.\r\nAll was ready, and an assault was ordered for next day. It was\r\nresolved to cross the Shannon in three places--one body to cross by\r\nthe narrow ford below the bridge, another by the pontoons above it,\r\nwhile the main body was to force the bridge itself. On the morning of\r\nthe intended crossing, the Irish sent a volley of grenades among the\r\nwooden work of the bridge, when some of the fascines took fire, and\r\nthe whole fabric was soon in a blaze. The smoke blew into the faces of\r\nthe English, and it was found impossible to cross the river that day.\r\n\r\nA council of war was held, to debate whether it was advisable to renew\r\nthe attack or to raise the siege and retreat. The cannonade had now\r\ncontinued for eight days, and nothing had been gained. Some of the\r\nofficers were for withdrawing, but the majority were in favour of\r\nmaking a general assault on the following day--seeing more danger in\r\nretreating than in advancing. The Duke of Wurtemberg, Major-Generals\r\nMackay, Talmash, Ruvigny, Tetleau, and Colonel Cambon urged \"that no\r\nbrave action could be performed without hazard; and that the attempt\r\nwas like to be attended with success.\" Moreover, they proffered\r\nthemselves to be the first to pass the river and attack the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe assault was therefore agreed upon. The river was then at the\r\nlowest state at which it had been for years. Next morning, at six\r\no'clock--the usual hour for relieving guards--the detachments were led\r\ndown to the river. Captain Sands led the first party of sixty\r\ngrenadiers. They were supported by another strong detachment of\r\ngrenadiers and six battalions of foot. They went into the water twenty\r\nabreast, clad in armour, and pushed across the ford a little below the\r\nbridge. The stream was very rapid, and the passage difficult, by\r\nreason of the great stones which lay at the bottom of the river. The\r\nguns played over them from the batteries and covered their passage.\r\nThe grenadiers reached the other side amidst the fire and smoke of\r\ntheir enemies. They held their ground and made for the bridge. Some of\r\nthem laid planks over the broken arch, and others helped at preparing\r\nthe pontoons. Thus the whole of the English army were able to cross to\r\nthe Irish side of the river. In less than half an hour they were\r\nmasters of the town. The Irish were entirely surprised. They fled in\r\nall directions, and lost many men. The besiegers did not lose above\r\nfifty.\r\n\r\nSt. Ruth, the Irish commander-in-chief, seemed completely idle during\r\nthe assault. It is true he ordered several detachments to drive the\r\nEnglish from the town after it had been taken; but, remembering that\r\nthe fortifications of Athlone, nearest to his camp, had not been\r\nrazed, and that they were now in possession of the enemy, he recalled\r\nhis troops, and decamped from before Athlone that very night. In a few\r\ndays Ginckel followed him, and inflicted on his army a terrible defeat\r\nat the battle of Aughrim. With that, however, we have nothing to do at\r\npresent, but proceed to follow the fortunes of Rapin.\r\n\r\nRapin entered Athlone with his regiment, and conducted himself with\r\nhis usual valour. Ginckel remained only a few days in the place, in\r\norder to repair the fortifications. That done, he set out in pursuit\r\nof the enemy. He left two regiments in the castle, one of which was\r\nthat to which Rapin belonged. The soldiers, who belonged to different\r\nnationalities, had many contentions with each other. The officers\r\nstood upon their order of precedence. The men were disposed to\r\nquarrel. Aided by a friend, a captain like himself, Rapin endeavoured\r\nto pacify the men, and to bring the officers to reason. By his kind,\r\ngentle, and conciliatory manner, he soon succeeded in restoring quiet\r\nand mutual confidence; and during his stay at Athlone no further\r\ndisturbance occurred among the garrison.\r\n\r\nRapin was ordered to Kilkenny, where he had a similar opportunity of\r\ndisplaying his qualities of conciliation. A quarrel had sprung up\r\nbetween the chief magistrate of the town and the officers of the\r\ngarrison. Rapin interceded, and by his firmness and moderation he\r\nreconciled all differences; and, at the same time, he gained the\r\nrespect and admiration of both the disputing parties.\r\n\r\nBy this time the second siege of Limerick had occurred. Ginckel\r\nsurrounded the city, and battered the walls and fortresses for six\r\nweeks. The French and Irish armies at length surrendered. Fourteen\r\nthousand Irish marched out with the honours of war. A large proportion\r\nof them joined the army of Louis XIV., and were long after known as\r\n\"The Irish Brigade.\" Although they fought valiantly and honourably in\r\nmany well-known battles, they were first employed in Louis'\r\npersecution of the Protestants in the Vaudois and Cevennes mountains.\r\nTheir first encounter was with the Camisards, under Cavalier, their\r\npeasant leader. They gained no glory in that campaign, but a good deal\r\nof discredit.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Ireland had been restored to peace. After the\r\nsurrender of Limerick no further resistance was offered to the arms of\r\nWilliam III. A considerable body of English troops remained in Ireland\r\nto garrison the fortresses. Rapin's regiment was stationed at Kinsale,\r\nand there he rejoined it in 1693. He made the intimate friendship of\r\nSir James Waller, the governor of the town. Sir James was a man of\r\nmuch intelligence, a keen observer, and an ardent student. By his\r\nknowledge of political history, he inspired Rapin with a like taste,\r\nand determined him at a later period in his life to undertake what was\r\na real want at the time, an intelligent and readable history of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nRapin was suddenly recalled to England. He was required to leave his\r\nregiment and report himself to King William. No reason was given; but\r\nwith his usual obedience to orders he at once set out. He did not\r\nleave Ireland without regret. He was attached to his numerous Huguenot\r\ncomrades, and he hoped yet to rise to higher guides in the King's\r\nservice. By special favour he was allowed to hand over his company to\r\nhis brother Solomon, who had been wounded at the first siege of\r\nLimerick. His brother received the promotion which he himself had\r\ndeserved, and afterwards became lieutenant-colonel of dragoons.\r\nRapin's fortune led him in quite another direction.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that, by the recommendation of the Earl of Galway\r\n(formerly the Marquis de Ruvigny, another French Huguenot), he had\r\nbeen recalled to London for the purpose of being appointed governor\r\nand tutor to Lord Woodstock, son of Bentinck, Earl of Portland, one of\r\nKing William's most devoted servants. Lord Galway was consulted by the\r\nKing as to the best tutor for the son of his friend. He knew of\r\nRapin's valour and courage during his campaigns in Ireland; he also\r\nknew of his discretion, his firmness, and his conciliatory manners, in\r\nreconciling the men under his charge at Athlone and Kilkenny; and he\r\nwas also satisfied about his thoughtfulness, his delicacy of spirit,\r\nhis grace and his nobleness--for he had been bred a noble, though he\r\nhad first served as a common soldier in the army of William.\r\n\r\nThe King immediately approved the recommendation of Lord Galway. He\r\nknew of Rapin's courage at the battle of the Boyne; and he\r\nremembered--as every true captain does remember--the serious wound he\r\nhad received while accompanying the forlorn hope at the first siege of\r\nLimerick. Hence the sudden recall of Rapin from Ireland. On his\r\narrival in London he was presented to the King, and immediately after\r\nhe entered upon his new function of conducting the education of the\r\nfuture Duke of Portland.\r\n\r\nHenry, Lord Woodstock, was then about fifteen. Being of delicate\r\nhealth, he had hitherto been the object of his father's tender care,\r\nand it was not without considerable regret that Lord Portland yielded\r\nto the request of the King and handed over his son to the government\r\nof M. Rapin. Though of considerable intelligence, the powers of his\r\nheart were greater than those of his head. Thus Rapin had no\r\ndifficulty in acquiring the esteem and affection of his pupil.\r\n\r\nPortland House was then the resort of the most eminent men of the Whig\r\nparty, through whose patriotic assistance the constitution of England\r\nwas placed in the position which it now occupies. Rapin was introduced\r\nby Lord Woodstock to his friends. Having already mastered the English\r\nlanguage, he had no difficulty in understanding the conflicting\r\nopinions of the times. He saw history developing itself before his\r\neyes. He heard with his ears the discussions which eventuated in Acts\r\nof Parliament, confirming the liberties of the English people, the\r\nliberty of speech, the liberty of writing, the liberty of doing,\r\nwithin the limits of the common law.\r\n\r\nAll this was of great importance to Rapin. It prepared him for writing\r\nhis afterwards famous works, his \"History of England,\" and his\r\nDissertation on the Whigs and Tories. Rapin was not only a man of\r\ngreat accomplishments, but he had a remarkable aptitude for\r\nlanguages. He knew French and English, as well as Italian, Spanish,\r\nand German. He had an extraordinary memory, and a continuous\r\napplication and perseverance, which enabled him to suck the contents\r\nof many volumes, and to bring out the facts in future years during the\r\npreparation of his works. His memory seems to have been of the same\r\norder as that of Lord Macaulay, who afterwards made use of his works,\r\nand complimented his predecessor as to their value.\r\n\r\nAccording to the custom of those days, the time arrived when Rapin was\r\nrequired to make \"the grand tour\" with his pupil and friend, Lord\r\nWoodstock. This was considered the complement of English education\r\namongst the highest classes. It was thought necessary that young\r\nnoblemen should come in contact with foreigners, and observe the\r\nmanners and customs of other countries besides their own; and that\r\nthus they might acquire a sort of cosmopolitan education. Archbishop\r\nLeighton even considered a journey of this sort as a condition of\r\nmoral perfection. He quoted the words of the Latin poet: \"Homo sum, et\r\nnihil hominem à me alienum puto.\"\r\n\r\nNo one could be better fitted than Rapin to accompany the young lord\r\non his foreign travels. They went to Holland, Germany, France, Spain,\r\nand Italy. Rapin diligently improved himself, while instructing his\r\nfriend. He taught him the languages of the countries through which\r\nthey passed; he rendered him familiar with Greek and Latin; he\r\nrendered him familiar with the principles of mathematics. He also\r\nstudied with him the destinies of peoples and of kings, and pointed\r\nout to him the Divine will accomplishing itself amidst the destruction\r\nof empires. Withal he sought to penetrate the young soul of the friend\r\ncommitted to his charge with that firmness of belief and piety of\r\nsentiment which pervaded his own.\r\n\r\nIt was while in Italy that the Earl of Portland, at the instigation of\r\nRapin, requested copies to be made for him of the rarest and most\r\nprecious medals in point of historic interest; and also to purchase\r\nfor him objects of ancient workmanship. Hence Rapin was able to secure\r\nfor him the _Portland Vase_, now in the British Museum, one of the\r\nmost exquisite products of Roman and Etruscan ceramic art.\r\n\r\nIn 1699, the Earl of Portland was sent by William III. as ambassador\r\nto the court of Louis XIV., in connection with the negotiations as to\r\nthe Spanish succession. Lord Woodstock attended the embassy, and Rapin\r\naccompanied him. They were entertained at Versailles. Persecution was\r\nstill going on in France, although about eight hundred thousand\r\npersons had already left the country. Rapin at one time thought of\r\nleaving Lord Woodstock for a few days, and making a rapid journey\r\nsouth to visit his friends near Toulouse. But the thought of being\r\nmade a prisoner and sent to the galleys for life stayed him, and he\r\nremained at Versailles until the return of the embassy.\r\n\r\nRapin remained with Lord Woodstock for thirteen years. In the meantime\r\nhe had married, at the Hague, Marie Anne Testart, a refugee from\r\nSaint-Quentin. Jean Rou describes her as a true helpmeet for him,\r\nyoung, beautiful, rich, and withal virtuous, and of the most pleasing\r\nand gentle temper in the world. Her riches, however, were not great.\r\nShe had merely, like Rapin, rescued some portion of her heritage from\r\nthe devouring claws of her persecutors. Rapin accumulated very little\r\ncapital during his tutorship of Lord Woodstock; but to compensate him,\r\nthe King granted him a pension of £100 a year, payable by the States\r\nof Holland, until he could secure some better income.\r\n\r\nRapin lived for some time at the Hague. While there he joined a\r\nsociety of learned French refugees. Among them were Rotolf de la\r\nDenèse, Basnage de Beauval, and Jean Rou, secretary to the\r\nStates-General. One of the objects of the little academy was to\r\ntranslate the Psalms anew into French verse; but before the version\r\nwas completed, Rapin was under the necessity of leaving the Hague.\r\nWilliam III., his patron, died in 1701, when his pension was stopped.\r\nHe was promised some remunerative employment, but he was forgotten\r\namidst the press of applicants.\r\n\r\nAt length he removed to the little town of Wesel, on the Lower Rhine,\r\nin the beginning of May, 1707. He had a wife and four children to\r\nmaintain, and living was much more reasonable at Wesel than at the\r\nHague. His wife's modest fortune enabled him to live there to the end\r\nof his days. Wesel was also a resort of the French refugees--persons\r\nof learning and taste, though of small means. It was at his modest\r\nretreat at Wesel that Rapin began to arrange the immense mass of\r\ndocuments which he had been accumulating during so many years,\r\nrelating to the history of England. The first work which he published\r\nwas \"A Dissertation on the Origin and Nature of the English\r\nConstitution.\" It met with great success, and went through many\r\neditions, besides being translated into nearly all the continental\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nHe next proceeded with his great work, \"The History of England.\"\r\nDuring his residence in Ireland and England, he had read with great\r\ninterest all books relating to the early history of the Government of\r\nEngland. He began with, the history of England after the Norman\r\nConquest; but he found that he must begin at the beginning. He studied\r\nthe history of the Anglo-Saxons, but found it \"like a vast forest,\r\nwhere the traveller, with great difficulty, finds a few narrow paths\r\nto guide his wandering steps. It was this, however, that inspired him\r\nwith the design of clearing this part of the English history, by\r\nremoving the rubbish, and carrying on the thread so as to give, at\r\nleast, a general knowledge of the earlier history.\" Then he went back\r\nto Julius Cæsar's account of his invasion of Britain, for the purpose\r\nof showing how the Saxons came to send troops into this country, and\r\nnow the conquest which had cost them so much was at last abandoned by\r\nthe Romans. He then proceeded, during his residence in England, with\r\nhis work of reading and writing; but when he came to the reign of\r\nHenry II. he was about to relinquish his undertaking, when an\r\nunexpected assistance not only induced him to continue it, but to\r\nproject a much larger history of England than he had at first\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected assistance was the publication of Rymer's \"Foedera,\"\r\nat the expense of the British Government. The volumes as they came out\r\nwere sent to Rapin by Le Clerc (another refugee), a friend of Lord\r\nHalifax, who was one of the principal promoters of the publication.\r\nThis book was of infinite value to Rapin in enabling him to proceed\r\nwith his history. He prepared abstracts of seventeen volumes (now in\r\nthe Cottonian collection), to show the relation of the acts narrated\r\nin Rymer's \"Foedera\" to the history of England. He was also able to\r\ncompare the facts stated by English historians with, those of the\r\nneighbouring states, whether they were written in Latin, French,\r\nItalian, or Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe work was accomplished with great labour. It occupied seventeen\r\nyears of Rapin's life. The work was published at intervals. The first\r\ntwo volumes appeared in November, 1723. During the following year six\r\nmore volumes were published. The ninth and tenth volumes were left in\r\nmanuscript ready for the press. They ended with the coronation of\r\nWilliam and Mary at Westminster. Besides, he left a large number of\r\nMSS., which were made use of by the editor of the continuation of\r\nRapin's history.\r\n\r\nRapin died at Wesel in 1725, at the age of sixty-four. His work, the\r\ncause of his fatal illness, was almost his only pleasure. He was worn\r\nout by hard study and sedentary confinement, and at last death came to\r\nhis rescue. He had struggled all his life against persecution; against\r\nthe difficulties of exile; against the enemy; and though he did not\r\ndie on the field of battle, he died on the breach pen in hand, in work\r\nand duty, striving to commemorate the independence through which a\r\nnoble people had worked their way to ultimate freedom and liberty. The\r\nfollowing epitaph was inscribed over his grave:--\r\n\r\n  \"Ici le casque et la science,\r\n  L'esprit vif, la solidité,\r\n  La politesse et la sincérité\r\n  Ont fait une heureuse alliance,\r\n  Dont le public a profité.\"\r\n\r\nThe first edition of Rapin's history, consisting of ten volumes, was\r\npublished at the Hague by Rogessart. The Rev. David Durand added two\r\nmore volumes to the second edition, principally compiled from the\r\nmemoranda left by Rapin at his death. The twelfth volume concluded the\r\nreign of William III.\r\n\r\nThe fourth edition appeared in 1733. Being originally composed and\r\npublished in French, the work was translated into English by Mr. N.\r\nTindal, who added numerous notes. Two editions wore published\r\nsimultaneously in London, and a third translation was published some\r\nsixty years later. The book was attacked by the Jacobite authors, who\r\ndefended the Stuart party against the statements of the author. In\r\nthose fanatical times impartiality was nothing to them. A man must be\r\nemphatically for the Stuarts, or against them. Yet the work of Rapin\r\nheld its ground, and it long continued to be regarded as the best\r\nhistory that had up to that time been written.\r\n\r\nThe Rapin family are now scattered over the world. Some remain in\r\nHolland, some have settled in Switzerland, some have returned to\r\nFrance, but the greater number are Prussian subjects. James, the only\r\nson of Rapin, studied at Cleves, then at Antwerp, and at thirty-one he\r\nwas appointed to the important office of Director of the French\r\nColonies at Stettin and Stargardt. Charles, Rapin's eldest brother,\r\nwas a captain of infantry in the service of Prussia. Two sons of Louis\r\nde Rapin were killed in the battles of Smolensko and Leipsic.\r\n\r\nMany of the Rapins attained high positions in the military service of\r\nPrussia. Colonel Philip de Rapin-Thoyras was the head of the family in\r\nPrussia. He was with the Allied Army in their war of deliverance\r\nagainst France in the years 1813, 1814, and 1815. He was consequently\r\ndecorated with the Cross and the Military Medal for his long and\r\nvalued services to the country of his adoption.\r\n\r\nThe handsome volume by Raoul de Cazenove, entitled \"Rapin-Thoyras, sa\r\nFamille, sa Vie, et ses OEuvres,\" to which we are indebted for much of\r\nthe above information, is dedicated to this distinguished military\r\nchief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN RIOU, R.N.\r\n\r\n   \"Brave hearts! to Britain's pride\r\n      Once so faithful and so true,\r\n    On the deck of fame that died,\r\n      With the gallant good Riou:\r\n  Soft sigh the winds of heaven o'er their grave!\"\r\n\r\n      CAMPBELL'S _Battle of the Baltic_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words in which Campbell describes Captain Riou in his noble ode\r\nare nearly identical with those used by Lord Nelson himself when\r\nalluding to his death in the famous despatch relative to the battle of\r\nCopenhagen. These few but pregnant words, \"the gallant and the good,\"\r\nconstitute nearly all the record that exists of the character of this\r\ndistinguished officer, though it is no slight glory to have them\r\nembalmed in the poetry of Campbell and the despatches of Nelson.\r\n\r\nHaving had the good fortune, in the course of recent inquiries as to\r\nthe descendants of illustrious Huguenots in England, to become\r\nacquainted with the principal events in Captain Riou's life, drawn\r\nfrom family papers, I now propose to supplement Lord Nelson's brief\r\nepitome of his character by the following memoir of this distinguished\r\nseaman.\r\n\r\nCaptain Riou was descended from the ancient Riou family of Vernoux, in\r\nLanguedoc, of whom early mention is made in French history, several\r\nmembers of it having specially distinguished themselves as generals in\r\nthe wars in Spain. Like many other noble families of Languedoc in the\r\nseventeenth century, the Rious were staunch Huguenots; and when, in\r\n1685, Louis XIV. determined to stamp out Protestantism in France, and\r\nrevoked the Edict of Nantes, the principal members of the family,\r\nrefusing to conform, left the country, and their estates were\r\nconfiscated by the Crown.\r\n\r\nEstienne Riou, heir to the estate at Vernoux, was born after the death\r\nof his father, who was a man of eminent repute in his neighbourhood;\r\nand he did not leave France until his eleventh year, when he fled with\r\nhis paternal uncle, Matthew Labrune, across the frontier, and took\r\nrefuge with him at Berne, in Switzerland. There the uncle engaged in\r\nbusiness as a merchant, while the nephew, when of sufficient age,\r\ndesirous of following the usual career of his family, went into\r\nPiedmont to join the little Huguenot army from England, then engaged\r\nin assisting the Duke of Savoy against the armies of the French king.\r\nEstienne was admitted a cadet in Lord Galway's regiment, then engaged\r\nin the siege of Casale; and he remained with it for two years, when,\r\non the army returning to England, he received an honourable discharge,\r\nand went back to reside for a time with his bachelor uncle at Berne.\r\n\r\nIn 1698 both uncle and nephew left Switzerland to settle in London as\r\nmerchants, bringing with them a considerable capital. They exported\r\nEnglish manufactured goods to the East Indies, Holland, Germany, and\r\nItaly; and imported large quantities of raw silk, principally from\r\nSpain and Italy, carrying on their business with uniform probity and\r\ncredit. In course of time Estienne married Magdalen Baudoin, the\r\ndaughter of a refugee gentleman from Touraine,--the members of\r\nrefugee families usually intermarrying for several generations after\r\ntheir settlement in England. The issue of this marriage was an only\r\nson, Stephen Riou, who, like his ancestors, embraced the profession of\r\narms, rising to be captain in the Horse Grenadier Guards. He\r\nafterwards attended the Confederate forces in Flanders as an engineer,\r\nand on the conclusion of peace, he travelled for nearly four years\r\nthrough the principal countries of Europe, accompanying Sir P. Ker\r\nPorter on his embassy to Constantinople. He afterwards settled,\r\nmarried, and had two sons,--Philip, the elder, who entered the Royal\r\nArtillery, and died senior colonel at Woolwich in 1817; and Edward,\r\nthe second son, who entered the navy--the subject of the present\r\nmemoir.\r\n\r\nEdward Riou was born at Mount Ephraim, near Faversham, on the 20th\r\nNovember, 1762. The family afterwards removed to London, where Edward\r\nreceived his education, partly at the Marylebone Grammar School and\r\npartly at home, where his father superintended his instruction in\r\nfortification, and navigation. Though of peculiarly sweet and amiable\r\ndisposition, young Riou displayed remarkable firmness and even\r\nfearlessness as a boy. He rejoiced at all deeds of noble daring, and\r\nit was perhaps his love of adventure that early determined his choice\r\nof a profession; for, even when a very little fellow, he was usually\r\nstyled by the servants and by his playmates, \"the noble captain.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when only twelve years old, he went to sea as midshipman\r\non board Admiral Pye's ship, the _Harfleur_; from whence, in the\r\nfollowing year, he was removed to the _Romney_, Captain Keith\r\nElphinstone, on the Newfoundland station; and on the return of the\r\nship to England in 1776, he had the good fortune to be appointed\r\nmidshipman on board the _Discovery_, Captain Charles Clarke, which\r\naccompanied Captain Cook in the _Resolution_ in his last voyage round\r\nthe world. Nothing could have been more to the mind of our sailor-boy\r\nthan this voyage of adventure and discovery, in company with the\r\ngreatest navigator of the age.\r\n\r\nThe _Discovery_ sailed from the Downs on the 18th of June, but had no\r\nsooner entered the Channel than a storm arose which did considerable\r\ndamage to the ship, which was driven into Portland Roads. At Plymouth,\r\nthe _Discovery_ was joined by the _Resolution_; but as the former had\r\nto go into harbour for repairs, Captain Cook set sail for the Cape\r\nalone, leaving orders for Captain Clarke to follow him there. The\r\n_Discovery_ at length put to sea, and after a stormy voyage joined\r\nCaptain Cook in Table Bay on the 11th of August. Before setting sail\r\non the longer voyage, Riou had the felicity of being transferred to\r\nthe _Resolution_, under the command of Captain Cook himself.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that we should describe this celebrated voyage,\r\nwith which every boy is familiar--its storms and hurricanes; the\r\nlandings on islands where the white man's face had never been seen\r\nbefore; the visits to the simple natives of Huahine and Otaheite, then\r\na little Eden; the perilous coasting along the North American seaboard\r\nto Behring's Straits, in search of the North-Western passage; and\r\nfinally, the wintering of the ships at Owyhee, where Captain Cook met\r\nhis cruel death, of which young Riou was a horror-struck spectator\r\nfrom the deck of the _Resolution_, on the morning of the 14th of\r\nFebruary, 1779.\r\n\r\nAfter about four years' absence on this voyage, so full of adventure\r\nand peril, Riou returned to England with the _Resolution_, and was\r\nshortly after appointed lieutenant of the sloop _Scourge_, Captain\r\nKnatchbull, Commander, which took part, under Lord Rodney, in the\r\nbombardment and capture of St. Eustatia. Here Riou was so severely\r\nwounded in the eye by a splinter that he lost his sight for many\r\nmonths. In March, 1782, he was removed to the _Mediator_, forty-four\r\nguns, commanded by Captain Luttrell, and shared in the glory which\r\nattached to the officers and crew of that ship through its almost\r\nunparalleled achievement of the 12th of December of that year.\r\n\r\nIt was at daybreak that the _Mediator_ sighted five sail of the enemy,\r\nconsisting of the _Ménagère_, thirty-six guns _en flûte_; the\r\n_Eugène_, thirty-six; and the _Dauphin Royal_, twenty-eight (French);\r\nin company with the _Alexander_, twenty-eight guns, and another brig,\r\nfourteen (American), formed in line of battle to receive the\r\n_Mediator_, which singly bore down upon them. The skilful seamanship\r\nand dashing gallantry of the English disconcerted the combinations of\r\nthe enemy, and after several hours' fighting two of their vessels fell\r\nout of the line, and went away, badly crippled, to leeward. About an\r\nhour later the _Alexander_ was cut off, the _Mediator_ wearing between\r\nher and her consorts, and in ten minutes she struck. A chase then\r\nensued after the larger vessels, and late in the evening the\r\n_Ménagère_, being raked within pistol shot, hailed for quarter. The\r\nrest of the squadron escaped, and the gallant _Mediator_, having taken\r\npossession of her two prizes, set sail with them for England, arriving\r\nin Cawsand Bay on the 17th of December.\r\n\r\nIn the year following, Captain Luttrell, having been appointed to the\r\n_Ganges_, took with him Mr. Riou as second lieutenant. He served in\r\nthis ship until the following summer, when he retired for a time on\r\nhalf-pay, devoting himself to study and continental travel until\r\nMarch, 1786, when we find him serving under Admiral Elliot as second\r\nlieutenant of the _Salisbury_. It was about this time that he\r\nsubmitted to the Admiralty a plan, doubtless suggested by his voyage\r\nwith Captain Cook, \"for the discovery and preservation of a passage\r\nthrough the continent of North America, and for the increase of\r\ncommerce to this kingdom.\" The plan was very favourably received, but\r\nas war seemed imminent, no steps were then taken to carry it into\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe young officer had, however, by this time recommended himself for\r\npromotion by his admirable conduct and his good service; and in the\r\nspring of 1789 he was appointed to the command of the _Guardian_,\r\nforty-four guns, armed _en flûte_, which was under orders to take out\r\nstores and convicts to New South Wales. In a chatty, affectionate letter\r\nwritten to his widowed mother, from on shipboard at the Cape while on\r\nthe voyage out, he says,--\"I have no expectation, after the promotion\r\nthat took place before I left England, of finding myself master and\r\ncommander on my return.\" After speculating as to what might happen in\r\nthe meantime while he was so far from home, and expressing an anxiety\r\nwhich was but natural on the part of an enterprising young officer eager\r\nfor advancement in his profession, he proceeded,--\"Politics must take a\r\ngreat turn, I think, by the time of my return. War will likely be begun;\r\nin that case we may bring a prize in with us. But our foresight is\r\nshort--and mine particularly so. I hardly ever look forward to beyond\r\nthree months. 'Tis in vain to be otherwise, for Providence, which\r\ndirects all things, is inscrutable.\" And he concluded his letter\r\nthus,--\"Now for Port Jackson. I shall sail to-night if the wind is fair.\r\nGod for ever bless you.\"\r\n\r\nBut neither Riou nor the ill-fated _Guardian_ ever reached Port\r\nJackson! A fortnight after setting sail from the Cape, while the ship\r\nwas driving through a thick fog (in lat. 44·5, long. 41) a severe\r\nshock suddenly called Riou to the deck, where an appalling spectacle\r\npresented itself. The ship had struck upon an iceberg. A body of\r\nfloating ice twice as high as the masthead was on the lee beam, and\r\nthe ship appeared to be entering a sort of cavern in its side. In a\r\nfew minutes the rudder was torn away, a severe leak was sprung, and\r\nall hands worked for bare life at the pumps. The ship became\r\ncomparatively unmanageable, and masses of overhanging ice threatened\r\nevery moment to overwhelm her. At length, by dint of incessant\r\nefforts, the ship was extricated from the ice, but the leak gained\r\nfearfully, and stores, cattle, guns, booms, everything that could be\r\ncut away, was thrown overboard.\r\n\r\nIt was all in vain. The ship seemed to be sinking; and despair sat on\r\nevery countenance save that of the young commander. He continued to\r\nhope even against hope. At length, after forty-eight hours of\r\nincessant pumping, a cry arose for \"the boats,\" as presenting the only\r\nchance of safety. Riou pleaded with the men to persevere, and they\r\nwent on bravely again at the pumps. But the dawn of another day\r\nrevealed so fearful a position of affairs that the inevitable\r\nfoundering of the ship seemed to be a matter of minutes rather than\r\nof hours. The boats were hoisted out, discipline being preserved to\r\nthe last. Riou's servant hastened to him to ask what boat he would\r\nselect to go in, that he himself might take a place beside him. His\r\nanswer was that \"he would stay by the ship, save her if he could, and\r\nif needs be sink with her, but that the people were at liberty to\r\nconsult their own safety.\" He then sat down and wrote the following\r\nletter to the Admiralty, giving it in charge to Mr. Clements, the\r\nmaster, whose boat was the only one that ever reached land:--\r\n\r\n                                   \"Her Majesty's Ship _Guardian_,\r\n                                        \"_December, 1789._\r\n\r\n     \"If any part of the officers or crew of the _Guardian_ should\r\n     ever survive to reach home, I have only to say that their\r\n     conduct, after the fatal stroke against an island of ice, was\r\n     admirable and wonderful in everything that relates to their\r\n     duties, considered either as private men or in his Majesty's\r\n     service. As there seems no possibility of my remaining many hours\r\n     in this world, I beg leave to recommend to the consideration of\r\n     the Admiralty a sister, to whom, if my conduct or services should\r\n     be found deserving any memory, favour might be shown, together\r\n     with a widowed mother.\r\n\r\n     \"I am, sir, with great respect,\r\n               \"Your ever obedient servant,\r\n                                        \"EDWARD RIOU.\r\n\r\n     \"PHILIP STEPHENS, ESQ.,\r\n        \"Admiralty.\"\r\n\r\nAbout half the crew remained with Riou, some because they determined\r\nto stand by their commander, and others because they could not get\r\naway in the boats, which, to avoid being overcrowded, had put off in\r\nhaste, for the most part insufficiently stored and provided. The sea,\r\nstill high, continued to make breaches over the ship, and many were\r\ndrowned in their attempts to reach the boats. Those who remained were\r\nexhausted by fatigue; and, without the most distant hope of life, some\r\nwere mad with despair. A party of these last contrived to break open\r\nthe spirit-room, and found a temporary oblivion in intoxication. \"It\r\nis hardly a time to be a disciplinarian,\" wrote Riou in his log, which\r\ncontinues a valued treasury in his family, \"when only a few more hours\r\nof life seem to present themselves; but this behaviour greatly hurts\r\nme.\" This log gives a detailed account, day by day, of the eight\r\nweeks' heroic fortitude and scientific seamanship which preserved the\r\n_Guardian_ afloat until she got into the track of ships, and was\r\nfinally towed by Dutch whalers into Table Bay, Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nThe master's boat, in which were also the purser and chaplain, had by\r\na miracle been picked up, and those officers, on their return to\r\nEngland, reported to the Admiralty \"the total loss of the _Guardian_\".\r\nThey also at the same time spoke of Riou's noble conduct in terms of\r\nsuch enthusiasm as to awaken general admiration, and occasion the\r\ngreatest regret at his loss. Accordingly, when the Admiralty received\r\nfrom his own hand the unexpected intelligence of his safety, his\r\nwidowed mother and only sister had the affectionate sympathy of all\r\nEngland. Lord Hood himself, before unknown to the family, hastened to\r\ntheir house with the news, calling to the servants as he ran up the\r\nstairs to \"throw off their mourning!\" The following was Riou's brief\r\nletter to his mother, which he found time to scrawl and send off by a\r\nship just leaving Table Bay for England as the poor helpless\r\n_Guardian_ was being towed in:--\r\n\r\n                                   \"Cape of Good Hope,\r\n                                        \"_February, 22, 1790_.\r\n\r\n     \"DEAREST,--God has been merciful. I hope you have no fatal\r\n     accounts of the _Guardian_. I am safe; I am well, notwithstanding\r\n     you may hear otherwise. Join with me in prayer to that blessed\r\n     Saviour who hath hung over my ship for two months, and kept thy\r\n     dear son safe, to be, I hope, thankful for almost a miracle. I\r\n     can say no more because I am hurried, and the ship sails for\r\n     England this afternoon.\r\n\r\n     \"Yours ever and ever,\r\n                                        \"EDWARD RIOU.\"\r\n\r\nRiou remained many months at the Cape trying to patch up the\r\n_Guardian_, and repair it so as to bring it back to port; but all his\r\nexertions were fruitless, and in October the Admiralty despatched the\r\n_Sphinx_ ship-of-war to bring him and the survivors of his crew to\r\nEngland, where they landed shortly after. There was, of course, the\r\nusual court-martial held upon him for the loss of his ship, but it was\r\nmerely a matter of form. At its conclusion he was complimented by the\r\nCourt in the warmest terms; and \"as a mark of the high consideration\r\nin which the magnanimity of his conduct was held, in remaining by his\r\nship from an exalted sense of duty when all reasonable prospects of\r\nsaving her were at an end,\" he received the special thanks of the\r\nAdmiralty, was made commander, and at the same time promoted to the\r\nrank of post captain.\r\n\r\nNo record exists of the services of Captain Riou from the date of his\r\npromotion until 1794, when we find him in command of his Majesty's\r\nship _Rose_, assisting in the reduction of Martinique. He was then\r\ntransferred to the _Beaulieu_, and remained cruising in the West\r\nIndian seas till his health became so injured by the climate that he\r\nfound himself compelled to solicit his recall, and he consequently\r\nreturned to England in the _Theseus_ in the following year. Shortly\r\nafter, in recognition of his distinguished services, he was appointed\r\nto the command of the royal yacht, the _Princess Augusta_, in which he\r\nremained until the spring of 1790. So soon as his health was\r\nsufficiently re-established, he earnestly solicited active employment,\r\nand he was accordingly appointed to the command of the fine frigate,\r\nthe _Amazon_, thirty-eight guns, whose name afterwards figured so\r\nprominently in Nelson's famous battle before Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nAfter cruising about in her on various stations, and picking up a few\r\nprizes, the _Amazon_, early in 1801, was attached to Sir Hyde Parker's\r\nfleet, destined for the Baltic. The last letter which Riou wrote home\r\nto his mother was dated Sunday, the 29th March, \"at the entrance to\r\nthe Sound;\" and in it he said:--\"It yet remains in doubt whether we\r\nare to fight the Danes, or whether they will be our friends.\" Already,\r\nhowever, Nelson was arranging his plan of attack, and on the following\r\nday, the 30th, the Admiral and all the artillery officers were on\r\nboard the _Amazon_, which proceeded to examine the northern channel\r\noutside Copenhagen Harbour. It was on this occasion that Riou first\r\nbecame known to Nelson, who was struck with admiration at the superior\r\ndiscipline and seamanship which were observable on board the frigate\r\nduring the proceedings of that day.\r\n\r\nEarly in the evening of the 1st of April the signal to prepare for\r\naction was made; and Lord Nelson, with Riou and Foley, on board the\r\n_Elephant_--all the other officers having returned to their\r\nrespective ships--arranged the order of battle on the following day.\r\nWhat remains to be told of Riou is matter of history. The science and\r\nskill in navigation which made Nelson intrust to him the last\r\nsoundings, and place under his command the fire-ships which were to\r\nlead the way on the following morning,--the gallantry with which the\r\ncaptain of the _Amazon_ throw himself, _impar congressus_, under the\r\nfearful fire of the Trekroner battery, to redeem the failure\r\nthreatened by the grounding of the ships of the line,--have all been\r\ntold with a skilful pen, and forms a picture of a great sailor's last\r\nhours, which is cherished with equal pride in the affections of his\r\nfamily and the annals of his country.\r\n\r\nSir Hyde Parker's signal to \"leave off action,\" which Nelson, putting\r\nhis telescope to his blind eye, refused to see, was seen, by Riou and\r\nreluctantly obeyed. Indeed, nothing but that signal for retreat saved\r\nthe _Amazon_ from destruction, though it did not save its heroic\r\ncommander. As he unwillingly drew off from the destructive fire of the\r\nbattery he mournfully exclaimed, \"What will Nelson think of us!\" His\r\nclerk had been killed by his side. He himself had been wounded in the\r\nhead by a splinter, but continued to sit on a gun encouraging his men,\r\nwho were falling in numbers around him. \"Come then, my boys,\" he\r\ncried, \"let us all die together.\" Scarcely had he uttered the words,\r\nwhen a raking shot cut him in two. And thus, in an instant, perished\r\nthe \"gallant good Riou,\" at the early age of thirty-nine.\r\n\r\nRiou was a man of the truest and tenderest feelings, yet the bravest\r\nof the brave. His private correspondence revealed the most endearing\r\nqualities of mind and heart, while the nobility of his actions was\r\nheightened by lofty Christian sentiment, and a firm reliance on the\r\npower and mercy of God. His chivalrous devotion to duty in the face of\r\ndifficulty and danger heightened the affectionate admiration with\r\nwhich he was regarded, and his death before Copenhagen was mourned\r\nalmost as a national bereavement. The monument erected to his memory\r\nin St. Paul's Cathedral represented, however inadequately, the widely\r\nfelt sorrow which pervaded all classes at the early death of this\r\nheroic officer. \"Except it had been Nelson himself,\" says Southey,\r\n\"the British navy could not have suffered a severer loss.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Riou's only sister married Colonel Lyde Browne, who closed his\r\nhonourable career of twenty-three years' active service in Dublin, on\r\nJuly 23rd, 1803. Within two years of her bitter mourning for the death\r\nof her brother, she had also to mourn for the loss of her husband. He\r\nwas colonel of the 21st Fusiliers. He was hastening to the assistance\r\nof Lord Kilwarden on the fatal night of Emmett's rebellion, when he\r\nwas basely assassinated. He was buried in the churchyard of St.\r\nPaul's, Dublin, where his brother officers erected a marble tablet to\r\nhis memory. He left an only daughter, who was married, in 1826, to M.\r\nG. Benson, Esq., of Lulwyche Hall, Salop. It is through this lady that\r\nwe have been permitted to inspect the family papers relating to the\r\nlife and death of Captain Riou.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO THE COUNTRY OF THE VAUDOIS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"The country of Felix Neff.\" (Dauphiny.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDauphiny is one of the least visited of all the provinces of France.\r\nIt occupies a remote corner of the empire, lying completely out of the\r\ntrack of ordinary tourists. No great road passes through it into\r\nItaly, the Piedmontese frontier of which it adjoins; and the annual\r\nstreams of English and American travellers accordingly enter that\r\nkingdom by other routes. Even to Frenchmen, who travel little in their\r\nown country and still less in others, Dauphiny is very little known;\r\nand M. Joanne, who has written an excellent Itinerary of the South of\r\nFrance, almost takes the credit of having discovered it.\r\n\r\nYet Dauphiny is a province full of interest. Its scenery almost vies\r\nwith that of Switzerland in grandeur, beauty, and wildness. The great\r\nmountain masses of the Alps do not end in Savoy, but extend through\r\nthe south-eastern parts of France, almost to the mouths of the Rhône.\r\nPacked closer together than in most parts of Switzerland, the\r\nmountains of Dauphiny are furrowed by deep valleys, each with its\r\nrapid stream or torrent at bottom, in some places overhung by\r\nprecipitous rocks, in others hemmed in by green hills, over which are\r\nseen the distant snowy peaks and glaciers of the loftier mountain\r\nranges. Of these, Mont Pelvoux--whose double pyramid can be seen from\r\nLyons on a clear day, a hundred miles off--and the Aiguille du Midi,\r\nare among the larger masses, rising to a height little short of Mont\r\nBlanc itself.\r\n\r\nFrom the ramparts of Grenoble the panoramic view is of wonderful\r\nbeauty and grandeur, extending along the valleys of the Isère and the\r\nDrac, and across that of the Romanche. The massive heads of the Grand\r\nChartreuse mountains bound the prospect to the north; and the summits\r\nof the snow-clad Dauphiny Alps on the south and east present a\r\ncombination of bold valley and mountain scenery, the like of which is\r\nnot to be seen in France, if in Europe.\r\n\r\nBut it is not the scenery, or the geology, or the flora of the\r\nprovince, however marvellous these may be, that constitutes the chief\r\ninterest for the traveller through these Dauphiny valleys, so much as\r\nthe human endurance, suffering, and faithfulness of the people who\r\nhave lived in them in past times, and of which so many interesting\r\nremnants still survive. For Dauphiny forms a principal part of the\r\ncountry of the ancient Vaudois or Waldenses--literally, the people\r\ninhabiting the _Vaux_, or valleys--who for nearly seven hundred years\r\nbore the heavy brunt of Papal persecution, and are now, after all\r\ntheir sufferings, free to worship God according to the dictates of\r\ntheir conscience.\r\n\r\nThe country of the Vaudois is not confined, as is generally supposed,\r\nto the valleys of Piedmont, but extends over the greater part of\r\nDauphiny and Provence. From the main ridge of the Cottian Alps, which,\r\ndivide France from Italy, great mountain spurs are thrown out, which\r\nrun westward as well as eastward, and enclose narrow strips of\r\npasturage, cultivable land, and green shelves on the mountain sides,\r\nwhere a poor, virtuous, and hard-working race have long contrived to\r\nearn a scanty subsistence, amidst trials and difficulties of no\r\nordinary kind,--the greatest of which, strange to say, have arisen\r\nfrom the pure and simple character of the religion they professed.\r\n\r\nThe tradition which exists among them is, that the early Christian\r\nmissionaries, when travelling from Italy into Gaul by the Roman road\r\npassing over Mont Genèvre, taught the Gospel in its primitive form to\r\nthe people of the adjoining districts. It is even surmised that St.\r\nPaul journeyed from Rome into Spain by that route, and may himself\r\nhave imparted to the people of the valleys their first Christian\r\ninstruction. The Italian and Gallic provinces in that quarter were\r\ncertainly Christianized in the second century at the latest, and it is\r\nknown that the early missionaries were in the habit of making frequent\r\njourneys from the provinces to Rome. Wherefore it is reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the people of the valleys would receive occasional visits\r\nfrom the wayfaring teachers who travelled by the mountain passes in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood of their dwellings.\r\n\r\nAs years rolled on, and the Church at Rome became rich and allied\r\nitself with the secular power, it gradually departed more and more\r\nfrom its primitive condition,[92] until at length it was scarcely to\r\nbe recognised from the Paganism which it had superseded. The heathen\r\ngods were replaced by canonised mortals; Venus and Cupid by the Virgin\r\nand Child; Lares and Penates by images and crucifixes; while incense,\r\nflowers, tapers, and showy dresses came to be regarded as essential\r\nparts of the ceremonial of the new religion as they had been of the\r\nold. Madonnas winked and bled again, as the statues of Juno and Pompey\r\nhad done before; and stones and relics worked miracles as in the time\r\nof the Augurs.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 92: The ancient Vaudois had a saying, known in\r\n         other countries--\"Religion brought forth wealth, and the\r\n         daughter devoured the mother;\" and another of like meaning,\r\n         but less known--\"When the bishops' croziers became golden,\r\n         the bishops themselves became Wooden.\"]\r\n\r\nAttempts were made by some of the early bishops to stem this tide of\r\ninnovation. Thus, in the fourth, century, Ambrose, Bishop of Milan,\r\nand Philastrius, Bishop of Brescia, acknowledging no authority on\r\nearth as superior to that of the Bible, protested against the\r\nintroduction of images in churches, which they held to be a return to\r\nPaganism. Four centuries later, Claude, Bishop of Turin, advanced like\r\nviews, and opposed with energy the worship of images, which he\r\nregarded as absolute idolatry. In the meanwhile, the simple Vaudois,\r\nshut up in their almost inaccessible valleys, and knowing nothing of\r\nthese innovations, continued to adhere to their original primitive\r\nform of worship; and it clearly appears, from a passage in the\r\nwritings of St. Ambrose, that, in his time, the superstitions which\r\nprevailed elsewhere had not at all extended into the mountainous\r\nregions of his diocese.\r\n\r\nThe Vaudois Church was never, in the ordinary sense of the word, a\r\n\"Reformed\" Church, simply because it had not become corrupted, and did\r\nnot stand in need of \"reformation.\" It was not the Vaudois who left\r\nthe Church, but the Roman Church that left them in search of idols.\r\nAdhering to their primitive faith, they never recognised the paramount\r\nauthority of the Pope; they never worshipped images, nor used incense,\r\nnor observed Mass; and when, in the course of time, these corruptions\r\nbecame known to them, and they found that the Western Church had\r\nceased to be Catholic, and become merely Roman; they openly separated\r\nfrom it, as being no longer in conformity with the principles of the\r\nGospel as inculcated in the Bible and delivered to them by their\r\nfathers. Their ancient manuscripts, still extant, attest to the purity\r\nof their doctrines. They are written, like the Nobla Leyçon, in the\r\nRomance or Provençal--the earliest of the modern classical languages,\r\nthe language of the troubadours--though now only spoken as a _patois_\r\nin Dauphiny, Piedmont, Sardinia, the north of Spain, and the Balearic\r\nIsles.[93]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 93: Sismondi, \"Littérature du Midi de l'Europe,\" i.\r\n         159.]\r\n\r\nIf the age counts for anything, the Vaudois are justified in their\r\nclaim to be considered one of the oldest churches in Europe. Long\r\nbefore the conquest of England by the Normans, before the time of\r\nWallace and Bruce in Scotland, before England had planted its foot in\r\nIreland, the Vaudois Church existed. Their remoteness, their poverty,\r\nand their comparative unimportance as a people, for a long time\r\nprotected them from interference; and for centuries they remained\r\nunnoticed by Rome. But as the Western Church extended its power, it\r\nbecame insatiable for uniformity. It would not tolerate the\r\nindependence which characterized the early churches, but aimed at\r\nsubjecting them to the exclusive authority of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Vaudois, however, persisted in repudiating the doctrines and\r\nformularies of the Pope. When argument failed, the Church called the\r\nsecular arm to its aid, and then began a series of persecutions,\r\nextending over several centuries, which, for brutality and ferocity,\r\nare probably unexampled in history. To crush this unoffending but\r\nfaithful people, Rome employed her most irrefragable arguments--the\r\ncurses of Lucius and the horrible cruelties of Innocent--and the\r\n\"Vicar of Christ\" bathed the banner of the Cross in a carnage from\r\nwhich the wolves of Romulus and the eagles of Cæsar would have turned\r\nwith loathing.\r\n\r\nLong before the period of the Reformation, the Vaudois valleys were\r\nravaged by fire and sword because of the alleged heresy of the people.\r\nLuther was not born until 1483; whereas nearly four centuries before,\r\nthe Vaudois were stigmatized as heretics by Rome. As early as 1096, we\r\nfind Pope Urban II. describing Val Louise, one of the Dauphiny\r\nvalleys--then called Vallis Gyrontana, from the torrent of Gyr, which\r\nflows through it--as \"infested with heresy.\" In 1179, hot persecution\r\nraged all over Dauphiny, extending to the Albigeois of the South of\r\nFrance, as far as Lyons and Toulouse; one of the first martyrs being\r\nPierre Waldo, or Waldensis,[94] of Lyons, who was executed for heresy\r\nby the Archbishop of Lyons in 1180.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 94: It has been surmised by some writers that the\r\n         Waldenses derived their name from this martyr; but being\r\n         known as \"heretics\" long before his time, it is more probable\r\n         that they gave the name to him than that he did to them.]\r\n\r\nOf one of the early persecutions, an ancient writer says: \"In the year\r\n1243, Pope Innocent II. ordered the Bishop of Metz rigorously to\r\nprosecute the Vaudois, especially because they read the sacred books\r\nin the vulgar tongue.\"[95] From time to time, new persecutions were\r\nordered, and conducted with ever-increasing ferocity--the scourge, the\r\nbrand, and the sword being employed by turns. In 1486, while Luther\r\nwas still in his cradle, Pope Innocent VIII. issued a bull of\r\nextermination against the Vaudois, summoning all true Catholics to the\r\nholy crusade, promising free pardon to all manner of criminals who\r\nshould take part in it, and concluding with the promise of the\r\nremission of sins to every one who should slay a heretic.[96] The\r\nconsequence was, the assemblage of an immense horde of brigands, who\r\nwere let loose on the valleys of Dauphiny and Piedmont, which they\r\nravaged and pillaged, in company with eighteen thousand regular\r\ntroops, jointly furnished by the French king and the Duke of Savoy.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 95: Jean Leger, \"Histoire Générale des Églises\r\n         Évangéliques des Vallées de Piedmont, ou Vaudoises.\" Leyde,\r\n         1669. Part ii. 330.]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 96: Leger, ii. 8-20.]\r\n\r\nSometimes the valleys were under the authority of the kings of France,\r\nsometimes under that of the dukes of Savoy, whose armies alternately\r\noverran them; but change of masters and change of popes made little\r\ndifference to the Vaudois. It sometimes, however, happened, that the\r\npersecution waxed hotter on one side of the Cottian Alps, while it\r\ntemporarily relaxed on the other; and on such occasions the French and\r\nItalian Vaudois were accustomed to cross the mountain passes, and take\r\nrefuge in each others' valleys. But when, as in the above case, the\r\nkings, soldiers, and brigands, on both sides, simultaneously plied the\r\nbrand and the sword, the times were very troublous indeed for these\r\npoor hunted people. They had then no alternative but to climb up the\r\nmountains into the least accessible places, or hide themselves away\r\nin dens and caverns with their families, until their enemies had\r\ndeparted. But they were often, tracked to their hiding-places by their\r\npersecutors, and suffocated, strangled, or shot--men, women, and\r\nchildren. Hence there is scarcely a hiding-place along the\r\nmountain-sides of Dauphiny but has some tradition connected with it\r\nrelating to those dreadful times. In one, so many women and children\r\nwere suffocated; in another, so many perished of cold and hunger; in a\r\nthird, so many were ruthlessly put to the sword. If these caves of\r\nDauphiny had voices, what deeds of horror they could tell!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat is known as the Easter massacre of 1655 made an unusual sensation\r\nin Europe, but especially in England, principally through the attitude\r\nwhich Oliver Cromwell assumed in the matter. Persecution had followed\r\npersecution for nearly four hundred years, and still the Vaudois were\r\nneither converted nor extirpated. The dukes of Savoy during all that\r\ntime pursued a uniform course of treachery and cruelty towards this\r\nportion of their subjects. Sometimes the Vaudois, pressed by their\r\npersecutors, turned upon them, and drove them ignominiously out of\r\ntheir valleys. Then the reigning dukes would refrain for a time; and,\r\nprobably needing their help in one or other of the wars in which they\r\nwere constantly engaged, would promise them protection and privileges.\r\nBut such promises were invariably broken; and at some moment when the\r\nVaudois were thrown off their guard by his pretended graciousness, the\r\nduke for the time being would suddenly pounce upon them and carry fire\r\nand sword through their valleys.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the dukes of Savoy seem to have been about the most\r\nwrong-headed line of despots that ever cursed a people by their rule.\r\nTheir mania was soldiering, though they were oftener beaten than\r\nvictorious. They were thrashed out of Dauphiny by France, thrashed out\r\nof Geneva by the citizens, thrashed out of the valleys by their own\r\npeasantry; and still they went on raising armies, making war, and\r\nmassacring their Vaudois subjects. Being devoted servants of the Pope,\r\nin 1655 they concurred with him in the establishment of a branch of\r\nthe society _De Propaganda Fide_ at Turin, which extended over the\r\nwhole of Piedmont, for the avowed purpose of extirpating the heretics.\r\nOn Palm Sunday, the beginning of Holy Week, the society commenced\r\nactive proceedings. The army of Savoy advanced suddenly upon La Tour,\r\nand were let loose upon the people. A general massacre began,\r\naccompanied with shocking brutalities, and continued for more than a\r\nweek. In many hamlets not a cottage was left standing, and such of the\r\npeople as had not been able to fly into the upper valleys were\r\nindiscriminately put to the sword. And thus was Easter celebrated.\r\n\r\nThe noise of this dreadful deed rang through Europe, and excited a\r\ngeneral feeling of horror, especially in England. Cromwell, then at\r\nthe height of his power, offered the fugitive Vaudois an asylum in\r\nIreland; but the distance which lay between was too great, and the\r\nVaudois asked him to help them in some other way. Forthwith, he\r\naddressed letters, written by his secretary, John Milton,[97] to the\r\nprincipal European powers, calling upon them to join him in putting a\r\nstop to these horrid barbarities committed upon an unoffending\r\npeople. Cromwell did more. He sent the exiles £2,000 out of his own\r\npurse; appointed a day of humiliation and a general collection all\r\nover England, by which some £38,000 were raised; and dispatched Sir\r\nSamuel Morland as his plenipotentiary to expostulate in person with\r\nthe Duke of Savoy. Moreover, a treaty was on the eve of being signed\r\nwith France; and Cromwell refused to complete it until Cardinal\r\nMazarin had undertaken to assist him in getting right done to the\r\npeople of the valleys.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 97: It was at this time that Milton wrote his noble\r\n         sonnet, beginning--\r\n\r\n           \"Avenge, O Lord, Thy slaughter'd saints, whose bones\r\n            Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold,\" &c.]\r\n\r\nThese energetic measures had their effect. The Vaudois who survived\r\nthe massacre were permitted to return to their devastated homes, under\r\nthe terms of the treaty known as the \"Patents of Grace,\" which was\r\nonly observed, however, so long as Cromwell lived. At the Restoration,\r\nCharles II. seized the public fund collected for the relief of the\r\nVaudois, and refused to remit the annuity arising from the interest\r\nthereon which Cromwell had assigned to them, declaring that he would\r\nnot pay the debts of a usurper!\r\n\r\nAfter that time, the interest felt in the Vaudois was very much of a\r\ntraditional character. Little was known as to their actual condition,\r\nor whether the descendants of the primitive Vaudois Church continued\r\nto exist or not. Though English travellers--amongst others, Addison,\r\nSmollett, and Sterne--passed through the country in the course of last\r\ncentury, they took no note of the people of the valleys. And this\r\nstate of general ignorance as to the district continued down to within\r\nabout the last fifty years, when quite a new interest was imparted to\r\nthe subject through the labours and researches of the late Dr. Gilly,\r\nPrebendary of Durham.\r\n\r\nIt happened that that gentleman was present at a meeting of the\r\nSociety for Promoting Christian Knowledge, in the year 1820, when a\r\nvery touching letter was read to the board, signed \"Frederick Peyrani,\r\nminister of Pramol,\" requesting the assistance of the society in\r\nsupplying books to the Vaudois churches of Piedmont, who were\r\ndescribed as maintaining a very hard struggle with poverty and\r\noppression. Dr. Gilly was greatly interested by the reading of this\r\nletter. Indeed, the subject of it so strongly arrested his attention,\r\nthat he says it \"took complete possession of him.\" He proceeded to\r\nmake search for information about the Vaudois, but could find very\r\nlittle that was definite or satisfactory respecting them. Then it was\r\nthat he formed the determination of visiting the valleys and\r\nascertaining the actual condition of the people in person.\r\n\r\nHis visit was made in 1823, and in the course of the following year\r\nDr. Gilly published the result in his \"Narrative of an Excursion to\r\nthe Mountains of Piedmont.\" The book excited much interest, not only\r\nin England, but in other countries; and a movement was shortly after\r\nset on foot for the relief and assistance of the Vaudois. A committee\r\nwas formed, and a fund was raised--to which the Emperor of Russia and\r\nthe Kings of Prussia and Holland contributed--with the object, in the\r\nfirst place, of erecting a hospital for the sick and infirm Vaudois at\r\nLa Tour, in the valley of Luzern. It turned out that the money raised\r\nwas not only sufficient for this purpose, but also to provide schools\r\nand a college for the education of pastors, which were shortly after\r\nerected at the same place.\r\n\r\nIn 1829, Dr. Gilly made a second visit to the Piedmontese valleys,\r\npartly in order to ascertain how far the aid thus rendered to the poor\r\nVaudois had proved effectual, and also to judge in what way certain\r\nfurther sums placed at his disposal might best be employed for their\r\nbenefit.[98] It was in the course of his second visit that Dr. Gilly\r\nbecame aware of the fact that the Vaudois were not confined to the\r\nvalleys of Piedmont, but that numerous traces of them were also to be\r\nfound on the French side of the Alps, in Dauphiny and Provence. He\r\naccordingly extended his journey across the Col de la Croix into\r\nFrance, and cursorily visited the old Vaudois district of Val\r\nFressinières and Val Queyras, of which an account will be given in the\r\nfollowing chapters. It was while on this journey that Dr. Gilly became\r\nacquainted with the self-denying labours of the good Felix Neff among\r\nthose poor outlying Christians, with whose life and character he was\r\nso fascinated that he afterwards wrote and published the memoir of\r\nNeff, so well known to English readers.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 98: Dr. Gilly's narrative of his second visit to\r\n         the valleys was published in 1831, under the title of\r\n         \"Waldensian Researches.\"]\r\n\r\nSince that time occasional efforts have been made in aid of the French\r\nVaudois, though those on the Italian side have heretofore commanded by\r\nfar the larger share of interest. There have been several reasons for\r\nthis. In the first place, the French valleys are much less accessible;\r\nthe roads through some of the most interesting valleys are so bad that\r\nthey can only be travelled on foot, being scarcely practicable even\r\nfor mules. There is no good hotel accommodation in the district, only\r\n_auberges_, and these of an indifferent character. The people are also\r\nmore scattered, and even poorer than they are on the Italian side of\r\nthe Alps. Then the climate is much more severe, from the greater\r\nelevation of the sites of most of the Vaudois villages; so that when\r\npastors were induced to settle there, the cold, and sterility, and\r\nwant of domestic accommodation, soon drove them away. It was to the\r\nrigour of the climate that Felix Neff was eventually compelled to\r\nsuccumb.\r\n\r\nYet much has been done of late years for the amelioration of the\r\nFrench Vaudois; and among the most zealous workers in their behalf\r\nhave been the Rev. Mr. Freemantle, rector of Claydon, Bucks, and Mr.\r\nEdward Milsom, the well-known merchant of Lyons. It was in the year\r\n1851 that the Rev. Mr. Freemantle first visited the Vaudois of\r\nDauphiny. His attention was drawn to the subject while editing the\r\nmemoir of a young English clergyman, the Rev. Spencer Thornton, who\r\nhad taken Felix Neff for his model; and he was thereby induced to\r\nvisit the scene of Neff's labours, and to institute a movement on\r\nbehalf of the people of the French valleys, which has issued in the\r\nerection of schools, churches, and pastors' dwellings in several of\r\nthe most destitute places.\r\n\r\nIt is curious and interesting to trace the influence of personal\r\nexample on human life and action. As the example of Oberlin in the Ban\r\nde la Roche inspired Felix Neff to action, so the life of Felix Neff\r\ninspired that of Spencer Thornton, and eventually led Mr. Freemantle\r\nto enter upon the work of extending evangelization among the Vaudois.\r\nIn like manner, a young French pastor, M. Bost, also influenced by the\r\nlife and labours of Neff, visited the valleys some years since, and\r\nwrote a book on the subject, the perusal of which induced Mr. Milsom\r\nto lend a hand to the work which the young Genevese missionary had\r\nbegun. And thus good example goes on ever propagating itself; and\r\nthough the tombstone may record \"Hic jacet\" over the crumbling dust of\r\nthe departed, his spirit still lives and works through other\r\nminds--stimulates them to action, and inspires them with\r\nhope--\"allures to brighter worlds, and leads the way.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few words as to the origin of these fragmentary papers. In chalking\r\nout a summer holiday trip, one likes to get quite away from the\r\nordinary round of daily life and business. Half the benefits of such a\r\ntrip consists in getting out of the old ruts, and breathing fresh air\r\namidst new surroundings. But this is very difficult if you follow the\r\nordinary tourist's track. London goes with you and elbows you on your\r\nway, accompanied by swarms of commissionaires, guides, and beggars.\r\nYou encounter London people on the Righi, on the Wengern Alp, and\r\nespecially at Chamouni. Think of being asked, as I once was on\r\nentering the Pavilion at Montanvert, after crossing the Mer de Glace\r\nfrom the Mauvais Pas, \"Pray, can you tell me what was the price of\r\nBrighton stock when you left town?\"\r\n\r\nThere is no risk of such rencontres in Dauphiny, whose valleys remain\r\nin almost as primitive a state as they were hundreds of years ago.\r\nAccordingly, when my friend Mr. Milsom, above mentioned, invited me to\r\naccompany him in one of his periodical visits to the country of the\r\nVaudois, I embraced the opportunity with pleasure. I was cautioned\r\nbeforehand as to the inferior accommodation provided for travellers\r\nthrough the district. Tourists being unknown there, the route is not\r\npadded and cushioned as it is on all the beaten continental rounds.\r\nEnglish is not spoken; Bass's pale ale has not yet penetrated into\r\nDauphiny; nor do you encounter London tourists carrying their tin\r\nbaths about with them as you do in Switzerland. Only an occasional\r\nnegotiant comes up from Gap or Grenoble, seeking orders in the\r\nvillages, for whom the ordinary auberges suffice.\r\n\r\nWhere the roads are practicable, an old-fashioned diligence may\r\noccasionally be seen plodding along, freighted with villagers bound\r\nfor some local market; but the roads are, for the most part, as silent\r\nas the desert.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, the traveller in the valleys must be prepared to\r\n\"rough it\" a little. I was directed to bring with me only a light\r\nknapsack, a pair of stout hob-nailed shoes, a large stock of patience,\r\nand a small parcel of insect powder. The knapsack and the shoes I\r\nfound exceedingly useful, indeed indispensable; but I had very little\r\noccasion to draw upon either my stock of patience or insect powder.\r\nThe French are a tidy people, and though their beds, stuffed with\r\nmaize chaff, may be hard, they are tolerably clean. The food provided\r\nin the auberges is doubtless very different from what one is\r\naccustomed to at home; but with the help of cheerfulness and a good\r\ndigestion that difficulty too may be got over.\r\n\r\nIndeed, among the things that most strikes a traveller through France,\r\nas characteristic of the people, is the skill with which persons of\r\neven the poorest classes prepare and serve up food. The French women\r\nare careful economists and excellent cooks. Nothing is wasted. The\r\n_pot au feu_ is always kept simmering on the hob, and, with the help\r\nof a hunch of bread, a good meal may at any time be made from it. Even\r\nin the humblest auberge, in the least frequented district, the dinner\r\nserved up is of a quality such as can very rarely be had in any\r\nEnglish public-house, or even in most of our country inns. Cooking\r\nseems to be one of the lost arts of England, if indeed it ever\r\npossessed it; and our people are in the habit, through want of\r\nknowledge, of probably _wasting_ more food than would sustain many\r\nanother nation. But in the great system of National Education that is\r\nto be, no one dreams of including as a branch of it skill in the\r\npreparation and economy in the use of human food.\r\n\r\nThere is another thing that the traveller through France may always\r\ndepend upon, and that is civility. The politeness of even the French\r\npoor to each other is charming. They respect themselves, and they\r\nrespect each other. I have seen in France what I have not yet seen in\r\nEngland--young working men walking out their aged mothers arm in arm\r\nin the evening, to hear the band play in the \"Place,\" or to take a\r\nturn on the public promenade. But the French are equally polite to\r\nstrangers. A stranger lady may travel all through the rural districts\r\nof France, and never encounter a rude look; a stranger gentleman, and\r\nnever receive a rude word. That the French are a self-respecting\r\npeople is also evinced by the fact that they are a sober people.\r\nDrunkenness is scarcely known in France; and one may travel all\r\nthrough it and never witness the degrading sight of a drunken man.\r\n\r\nThe French are also honest and thrifty, and exceedingly hard-working.\r\nThe industry of the people is unceasing. Indeed it is excessive; for\r\nthey work Sunday and Saturday. Sunday has long ceased to be a Sabbath\r\nin France. There is no day of rest there. Before the Revolution, the\r\nsaints' days which the Church ordered to be observed so encroached\r\nupon the hours required for labour, that in course of time Sunday\r\nbecame an ordinary working day. And when the Revolution abolished\r\nsaints' days and Sabbath days alike, Sunday work became an established\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nWhat the so-called friends of the working classes are aiming at in\r\nEngland, has already been effected in France. The public museums and\r\npicture-galleries are open on Sunday. But you look for the working\r\npeople there in vain. They are at work in the factories, whose\r\nchimneys are smoking as usual; or building houses, or working in the\r\nfields, or they are engaged in the various departments of labour. The\r\ngovernment works all go on as usual on Sundays. The railway trains run\r\nprecisely as on week days. In short, the Sunday is secularised, or\r\nregarded but as a partial holiday.[99]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 99: I find the following under the signature of \"An\r\n         Operative Bricklayer,\" in the _Times_ of the 30th July, 1867:\r\n         \"I found there were a great number of men in Paris that\r\n         worked on the buildings who were not residents of the city.\r\n         The bricklayers are called _limousins_; they come from the\r\n         old province Le Limousin, where they keep their home, and\r\n         many of them are landowners. They work in Paris in the summer\r\n         time; they come up in large numbers, hire a place in Paris,\r\n         and live together, and by so doing they live cheap. In the\r\n         winter time, when they cannot work on the buildings, they go\r\n         back home again and take their savings, and stop there until\r\n         the spring, which is far better than it is in London; when\r\n         the men cannot work they are hanging about the streets. It\r\n         was with regret that I saw so many working on the Sunday\r\n         desecrating the Sabbath. I inquired why they worked on\r\n         Sunday; they told me it was to make up the time they lose\r\n         through wet and other causes. I saw some working with only\r\n         their trousers and shoes on, with a belt round their waist to\r\n         keep their trousers up. Their naked back was exposed to the\r\n         sun, and was as brown as if it had been dyed, and shone as if\r\n         it had been varnished. I asked if they had any hard-working\r\n         hearty old men. They answered me \"No; the men were completely\r\n         worn out by the time they reached forty years.\" That was a\r\n         clear proof that they work against the laws of nature. I\r\n         thought to myself--Glory be to you, O Englishmen, you know\r\n         the Fourth Commandment; you know the value of the seventh\r\n         day, the day of rest!\"]\r\n\r\nAs you pass through the country on Sundays, as on week-days, you see\r\nthe people toiling in the fields. And as dusk draws on, the dark\r\nfigures may be seen moving about so long as there is light to see by.\r\nIt is the peasants working the land, and it is _their own_. Such is\r\nthe \"magical influence of property,\" said Arthur Young, when he\r\nobserved the same thing.\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared, however, that the French peasantry are afflicted\r\nwith the disease which Sir Walter Scott called the \"earth-hunger;\" and\r\nthere is danger of the gravel getting into their souls. Anyhow, their\r\ncontinuous devotion to bodily labour, without a seventh day's rest,\r\ncannot fail to exercise a deteriorating effect upon their physical as\r\nwell as their moral condition; and this we believe it is which gives\r\nto the men, and especially to the women of the country, the look of a\r\nprematurely old and overworked race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY OF THE ROMANCHE--BRIANÇON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe route from Grenoble to the frontier fortress of Briançon lies for\r\nthe most part up the valley of the Romanche, which presents a variety\r\nof wild and beautiful scenery. In summer the river is confined within\r\ncomparatively narrow limits; but in autumn and spring it is often a\r\nfurious torrent, flooding the low-lying lands, and forcing for itself\r\nnew channels. The mountain heights which bound it, being composed for\r\nthe most part of schist, mica slate, and talcose slate, large masses\r\nbecome detached in winter--split off by the freezing of the water\r\nbehind them--when they descend, on the coming of thaw, in terrible\r\navalanches of stone and mud. Sometimes the masses are such as to dam\r\nup the river and form temporary lakes, until the accumulation of force\r\nbehind bursts the barrier, and a furious flood rushes down the valley.\r\nBy one of such floods, which occurred a few centuries since, through\r\nthe bursting of the hike of St. Laurent in the valley of the Romanche,\r\na large part of Grenoble was swept away, and many of the inhabitants\r\nwere drowned.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Romanche is no sooner entered, a few miles above\r\nGrenoble, than the mountains begin to close, the scenery becomes\r\nwilder, and the fury of the torrent is evinced by the masses of débris\r\nstrewed along its bed. Shortly after passing the picturesque defile\r\ncalled L'Étroit, where the river rushes through a deep cleft in the\r\nrocks, the valley opens out again, and we shortly come in sight of the\r\nancient town of Vizille--the most prominent building in which is the\r\nchâteau of the famous Duc de Lesdiguières, governor of the province in\r\nthe reign of Henry IV., and Constable of France in that of Louis XIII.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWherever you go in Dauphiny, you come upon the footmarks of this great\r\nsoldier. At Grenoble there is the Constable's palace, now the\r\nPrefecture; and the beautiful grounds adjoining it, laid out by\r\nhimself, are now the public gardens of the town. Between Grenoble and\r\nVizille there is the old road constructed by him, still known as \"Le\r\nchemin du Connétable.\" At St. Bonnet, in the valley of the Drac,\r\nformerly an almost exclusively Protestant town, known as \"the Geneva\r\nof the High Alps,\" you are shown the house in which the Constable was\r\nborn; and a little lower down the same valley, in the commune of\r\nGlaizil, on a hill overlooking the Drac, stand the ruins of the family\r\ncastle; where the Constable was buried. The people of the commune were\r\nin the practice of carrying away the bones from the family vault,\r\nbelieving them to possess some virtue as relics, until the prefect of\r\nthe High Alps ordered it to be walled up to prevent the entire removal\r\nof the skeletons.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of his career, Lesdiguières was one of the most\r\ntrusted chiefs of Henry of Navarre, often leading his Huguenot\r\nsoldiers to victory; capturing town after town, and eventually\r\nsecuring possession of the entire province of Dauphiny, of which\r\nHenry appointed him governor. In that capacity he carried out many\r\nimportant public works--made roads, built bridges, erected fourteen\r\nfortresses, and enlarged and beautified his palace at Grenoble and his\r\nchâteau at Vizille. He enjoyed great popularity during his life, and\r\nwas known throughout his province as \"King of the Mountains.\" But he\r\ndid not continue staunch either to his party or his faith. As in the\r\ncase of many of the aristocratic leaders of those times, Lesdiguières'\r\nreligion was only skin deep. It was but a party emblem--a flag to\r\nfight under, not a faith to live by. So, when ambition tempted him,\r\nand the Constable's baton dangled before his eyes, it cost the old\r\nsoldier but little compunction to abandon the cause which he had so\r\nbrilliantly served in his youth. To secure the prize which he so\r\ncoveted, he made public abjuration of his faith in the church, of St.\r\nAndrew's at Grenoble in 1622, in the presence of the Marquis de\r\nCrequi, the minister of Louis XIII., who, immediately after\r\nLesdiguières' first mass, presented him with the Constable's baton.\r\n\r\nBut the Lesdiguières family has long since passed away, and left no\r\ntraces. At the Revolution, the Constable's tomb was burst open, and\r\nhis coffin torn up. His monument was afterwards removed to Gap, which,\r\nwhen a Huguenot, he had stormed and ravaged. His château at Vizille\r\npassed through different hands, until in 1775 it came into the\r\npossession of the Périer family, to which the celebrated Casimir\r\nPérier belonged. The great Gothic hall of the château has witnessed\r\nmany strange scenes. In 1623, shortly after his investment as\r\nConstable, Lesdiguières entertained Louis XIII. and his court there,\r\nwhile on his journey into Italy, in the course of which he so\r\ngrievously ravaged the Vaudois villages. In 1788, the Estates of\r\nDauphiny met there, and prepared the first bold remonstrance against\r\naristocratic privileges, and in favour of popular representation,\r\nwhich, in a measure, proved the commencement of the great Revolution.\r\nAnd there too, in 1822, Felix Neff preached to large congregations,\r\nwho were so anxious and attentive that he always after spoke of the\r\nplace as his \"dear Vizille;\" and now, to wind up the vicissitudes of\r\nthe great hall, it is used as a place for the printing of Bandana\r\nhandkerchiefs!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Neff made his flying visits to Vizille, he was temporarily\r\nstationed at Mens, which was the scene of his first labours in\r\nDauphiny. The place lies not far from Vizille, away among the\r\nmountains towards the south. During the wars of religion, and more\r\nespecially after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, Mens became a\r\nplace of refuge for the Protestants, who still form about one-half of\r\nits population. Although, during the long dark period of religious\r\npersecution which followed the Revocation, the Protestants of Mens and\r\nthe neighbouring villages did not dare to show themselves, and\r\nworshipped, if at all, only in their dwellings, in secret, or in \"the\r\nDesert,\" no sooner did the Revolution set them at liberty than they\r\nformed themselves again into churches, and appointed pastors; and it\r\nwas to serve them temporarily in that capacity that Felix Neff first\r\nwent amongst them, and laboured there and at Vizille with such good\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot far from Mens is a place which has made much more noise in the\r\nworld--no other than La Salette, the scene of the latest Roman\r\n\"miracle.\" La Salette is one of the side-valleys of the large valley\r\nof the Drac, which joins the Romanche a few miles above Grenoble.\r\nThere is no village of La Salette, but a commune, which is somewhat\r\nappropriately called La Salette-Fallavaux, the latter word being from\r\n_fallax vallis_, or \"the lying valley.\"\r\n\r\nAbout twenty-seven years ago, on the 19th of September, 1846, two\r\nchildren belonging to the hamlet of Abladens--the one a girl of\r\nfourteen, the other a boy of twelve years old--came down from the\r\nlofty pasturage of Mont Gargas, where they had been herding cattle,\r\nand told the following strange story. They had seen the Virgin Mary\r\ndescend from heaven with a crucifix suspended from her neck by a gold\r\nchain, and a hammer and pincers suspended from the chain, but without\r\nany visible support. The figure sat down upon a large stone, and wept\r\nso piteously as shortly to fill a large pool with her tears.\r\n\r\nWhen the story was noised abroad, people came from all quarters, and\r\nwent up the mountain to see where the Virgin had sat. The stone was\r\nsoon broken off in chips and carried away as relics, but the fountain\r\nfilled with the tears is still there, tasting very much, like ordinary\r\nspring water.\r\n\r\nTwo priests of Grenoble, disgusted at what they believed to be an\r\nimposition, accused a young person of the neighbourhood, one Mdlle. de\r\nLamerlière, as being the real author of the pretended miracle, on\r\nwhich she commenced an action against them for defamation of\r\ncharacter. She brought the celebrated advocate Jules Favre from Paris\r\nto plead her cause, but the verdict was given in favour of the two\r\npriests. The \"miracle\" was an imposture!\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this circumstance, the miracle came to be generally\r\nbelieved in the neighbourhood. The number of persons who resorted to\r\nthe place with money in their pockets steadily increased. The question\r\nwas then taken up by the local priests, who vouched for the\r\nauthenticity of the miracle seen by the two children. The miracle was\r\nnext accepted by Rome.[100] A church was built on the spot by means of\r\nthe contributions of the visitors--L'Église de la Salette--and thither\r\npilgrims annually resort in great numbers, the more devout climbing\r\nthe hill, from station to station, on their knees. As many as four\r\nthousand persons of both sexes, and of various ages, have been known\r\nto climb the hill in one day--on the anniversary of the appearance of\r\nthe apparition--notwithstanding the extreme steepness and difficulties\r\nof the ascent.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 100: An authorised account was prepared by Cardinal\r\n         Wiseman for English readers, entitled \"Manual of the\r\n         Association of our Lady of Reconciliation of La Salette,\" and\r\n         published as a tract by Burns, 17, Portman Street, in 1853.\r\n         Since I passed through the country in 1869, the Germans have\r\n         invaded France, the surrender has occurred at Sedan, the\r\n         Commune has been defeated at Paris, but Our Lady of La\r\n         Salette is greater than ever. A temple of enormous dimensions\r\n         has risen in her honour; the pilgrims number over 100,000\r\n         yearly, and the sale of the water from the Holy Well, said to\r\n         have sprung from the Virgin's tears, realises more than\r\n         £12,000. Since the success of La Salette, the Virgin has been\r\n         making repeated appearances in France. Her last appearance\r\n         was in a part of Alsace which is strictly Catholic. The\r\n         Virgin appeared, as usual, to a boy of the mature age of six,\r\n         \"dressed in black, floating in the air, her hands bound with\r\n         chains,\"--a pretty strong religio-political hint. When a\r\n         party of the 5th Bavarian Cavalry was posted in Bettweiler,\r\n         the Virgin ceased to make her appearance.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a pendant to this story, another may be given of an entirely\r\ndifferent character, relating to the inhabitants of another commune in\r\nthe same valley, about midway between La Salette and Grenoble. In\r\n1860, while the discussion about the miracle at La Salette was still\r\nin progress, the inhabitants of Notre-Dame-de-Comiers, dissatisfied\r\nwith the conduct of their curé, invited M. Fermaud, pastor of the\r\nProtestant church at Grenoble, to come over and preach to them, as\r\nthey were desirous of embracing Protestantism. The pastor, supposing\r\nthat they were influenced by merely temporary irritation against their\r\ncuré, cautioned the deputation that waited upon him as to the gravity\r\nof their decision in such a matter, and asked them to reflect further\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nFor several years M. Fermaud continued to maintain the same attitude,\r\nuntil, in 1865, a formal petition was delivered to him by the mayor of\r\nthe place, signed by forty-three heads of families, and by nine out of\r\nthe ten members of the council of the commune, urging him to send them\r\nover a minister of the evangelical religion. Even then he hesitated,\r\nand recommended the memorialists to appeal to the bishop of the\r\ndiocese for redress of the wrongs of which he knew they complained,\r\nbut in vain, until at length, in the beginning of 1868, with the\r\nsanction of the consistory of Grenoble a minister was sent over to\r\nComiers to perform the first acts of Protestant worship, including\r\nbaptism and marriage; and it was not until October in the same year\r\nthat Pastor Fermaud himself went thither to administer the sacrament\r\nto the new church.\r\n\r\nThe service was conducted in the public hall of the commune, and was\r\nattended by a large number of persons belonging to the town and\r\nneighbourhood. The local clergy tried in vain to check the movement.\r\nQuite recently, when the curé entered one of the schools to inscribe\r\nthe names of the children who were to attend their first mass, out of\r\nfifteen of the proper age eleven answered to the interrogatory of the\r\npriest, \"Monsieur, nous sommes Protestantes.\" The movement has also\r\nextended into the neighbouring communes, helped by the zeal of the new\r\nconverts, one of whom is known in the neighbourhood as \"Père la\r\nBible,\" and it is possible that before long it may even extend to La\r\nSalette itself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe route from Vizille up the valley of the Romanche continues hemmed\r\nin by rugged mountains, in some places almost overhanging the river.\r\nAt Séchilienne it opens out sufficiently to afford space for a\r\nterraced garden, amidst which stands a handsome château, flanked by\r\ntwo massive towers, commanding a beautiful prospect down the valley.\r\nThe abundant water which rushes down from the mountain behind is\r\npartly collected in a reservoir, and employed to feed a _jet d'eau_\r\nwhich rises in a lofty column under the castle windows. Further up,\r\nthe valley again contracts, until the Gorge de Loiret is passed. The\r\nroad then crosses to the left bank, and used to be continued along it,\r\nbut the terrible torrent of 1868 washed it away for miles, and it has\r\nnot yet been reconstructed. Temporary bridges enable the route to be\r\npursued by the old road on the right bank, and after passing through\r\nseveral hamlets of little interest, we arrive at length at the\r\ncultivated plain hemmed in by lofty mountains, in the midst of which\r\nBourg d'Oisans lies seated.\r\n\r\nThis little plain was formerly occupied by the lake of St. Laurent,\r\nformed by the barrier of rocks and débris which had tumbled down from\r\nthe flank of the Petite Voudène, a precipitous mountain escarpment\r\noverhanging the river. At this place, the strata are laid completely\r\nbare, and may be read like a book. For some distance along the valley\r\nthey exhibit the most extraordinary contortions and dislocations,\r\nimpressing the mind with the enormous natural forces that must have\r\nbeen at work to occasion such tremendous upheavings and disruptions.\r\nElie de Beaumont, the French geologist, who has carefully examined the\r\ndistrict, says that at the Montagne d'Oisans he found the granite in\r\nsome places resting upon the limestone, cutting through the Calcareous\r\nbeds, rising like a wall and lapping over them.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Bourg d'Oisans, we put up at the Hôtel de Milan close\r\nby the bridge; but though dignified with the name of hotel, it is only\r\na common roadside inn. Still, it is tolerably clean, and in summer the\r\nwant of carpets is not missed. The people were civil and attentive,\r\ntheir bread wholesome, their pottage and bouilli good--being such fare\r\nas the people of the locality contrive to live and thrive upon. The\r\naccommodation of the place is, indeed, quite equal to the demand; for\r\nvery few travellers accustomed to a better style of living pass that\r\nway. When the landlady was asked if many tourists had passed this\r\nyear, she replied, \"Tourists! We rarely see such travellers here. You\r\nare the first this season, and perhaps you may be the last.\"\r\n\r\nYet these valleys are well worthy of a visit, and an influx of\r\ntourists would doubtless have the same effect that it has already had\r\nin Switzerland and elsewhere, of greatly improving the hotel\r\naccommodation throughout the district. There are many domestic\r\narrangements, costing very little money, but greatly ministering to\r\ncleanliness and comfort, which might very readily be provided. But the\r\npeople themselves are indifferent to them, and they need the requisite\r\nstimulus of \"pressure from without.\" One of the most prominent\r\ndefects--common to all the inns of Dauphiny--having been brought\r\nunder the notice of the landlady, she replied, \"C'est vrai, monsieur;\r\nmais--il laisse quelque chose à desirer!\" How neatly evaded! The very\r\ndefect was itself an advantage! What would life be--what would hotels\r\nbe--if there were not \"something left to be desired!\"\r\n\r\nThe view from the inn at the bridge is really charming. The little\r\nriver which runs down the valley, and becomes lost in the distance, is\r\nfinally fringed with trees--alder, birch, and chestnut. Ridge upon\r\nridge of mountain rises up behind on the right hand and the left, the\r\nlower clothed with patches of green larch, and the upper with dark\r\npine. Above all are ranges of jagged and grey rocks, shooting up in\r\nmany places into lofty peaks. The setting sun, shining across the face\r\nof the mountain opposite, brings out the prominent masses in bold\r\nrelief, while the valley beneath hovers between light and shadow,\r\nchanging almost from one second to another as the sun goes down. In\r\nthe cool of the evening, we walked through the fields across the\r\nplain, to see the torrent, visible from the village, which rushes from\r\nthe rocky gorge on the mountain-side to join its waters to the\r\nRomanche. All along the valleys, water abounds--sometimes bounding\r\nfrom the heights, in jets, in rivulets, in masses, leaping from rock\r\nto rock, and reaching the ground only in white clouds of spray, or, as\r\nin the case of the little river which flows alongside the inn at the\r\nbridge, bursting directly from the ground in a continuous spring;\r\nthese waterfalls, and streams, and springs being fed all the year\r\nthrough by the immense glaciers that fill the hollows of the mountains\r\non either side the valley.\r\n\r\nThough the scenery of Bourg d'Oisans is not, as its eulogists allege,\r\nequal to that of Switzerland, it will at least stand a comparison\r\nwith that of Savoy. Its mountains are more precipitous and abrupt, its\r\npeaks more jagged, and its aspect more savage and wild. The scenery of\r\nMont Pelvoux, which is best approached from Bourg d'Oisans, is\r\nespecially grand and sublime, though of a wild and desolate character.\r\nThe road from Bourg d'Oisans to Briançon also presents some\r\nmagnificent scenery; and there is one part of it that is not perhaps\r\nsurpassed even by the famous Via Mala leading up to the Splügen. It is\r\nabout three miles above Bourg d'Oisans, from which we started early\r\nnext morning. There the road leaves the plain and enters the wild\r\ngorge of Freney, climbing by a steep road up the Rampe des Commières.\r\nThe view from the height when gained is really superb, commanding an\r\nextremely bold and picturesque valley, hemmed in by mountains. The\r\nledges on the hillsides spread out in some places so as to afford\r\nsufficient breadths for cultivation; occasional hamlets appear amidst\r\nthe fields and pine-woods; and far up, between you and the sky, an\r\noccasional church spire peeps up, indicating still loftier\r\nsettlements, though how the people contrive to climb up to those\r\nheights is a wonder to the spectator who views them from below.\r\n\r\nThe route follows the profile of the mountain, winding in and out\r\nalong its rugged face, scarped and blasted so as to form the road. At\r\none place it passes along a gallery about six hundred feet in length,\r\ncut through a precipitous rock overhanging the river, which dashes,\r\nroaring and foaming, more than a thousand feet below, through the\r\nrocky abyss of the Gorge de l'Infernet. Perhaps there is nothing to be\r\nseen in Switzerland finer of its kind than the succession of charming\r\nlandscapes which meet the eye in descending this pass.\r\n\r\nBeyond the village of Freney we enter another defile, so narrow that\r\nin places there is room only for the river and the road; and in winter\r\nthe river sometimes plays sad havoc with the engineer's constructions.\r\nAbove this gorge, the Romanche is joined by the Ferrand, an impetuous\r\ntorrent which comes down from the glaciers of the Grand Rousses.\r\nImmediately over their point of confluence, seated on a lofty\r\npromontory, is the village of Mizoën--a place which, because of the\r\noutlook it commands, as well as because of its natural strength, was\r\none of the places in which the Vaudois were accustomed to take refuge\r\nin the times of the persecutions. Further on, we pass through another\r\ngallery in the rock, then across the little green valley of Chambon to\r\nLe Dauphin, after which the scenery becomes wilder, the valley--here\r\ncalled the Combe de Malaval (the \"Cursed Valley\")--rocky and sterile,\r\nthe only feature to enliven it being the Cascade de la Pisse, which\r\nfalls from a height of over six hundred feet, first in one jet, then\r\nbecomes split by a projecting rock into two, and finally reaches the\r\nground in a shower of spray. Shortly after we pass another cascade,\r\nthat of the Riftort, which also joins the Romanche, and marks the\r\nboundary between the department of the Isère and that of the Hautes\r\nAlpes, which we now enter.\r\n\r\nMore waterfalls--the Sau de la Pucelle, which falls from a height of\r\nsome two hundred and fifty feet, resembling the Staubbach--besides\r\nrivulets without number, running down the mountain-sides like silver\r\nthreads; until we arrive at La Grave, a village about five thousand\r\nfeet above the sea-level, directly opposite the grand glaciers of\r\nTabuchet, Pacave, and Vallon, which almost overhang the Romanche,\r\ndescending from the steep slopes of the gigantic Aiguille du Midi, the\r\nhighest mountain in the French Alps,--being over 13,200 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter resting some two hours at La Grave, we proceeded by the two\r\ntunnels under the hamlet of Ventelong--one of which is 650 and the\r\nother 1,800 feet long--to the village of Villard d'Arene, which,\r\nthough some five thousand feet above the level of the sea, is so\r\nsurrounded by lofty mountains that for months together the sun never\r\nshines on it. From thence a gradual ascent leads up to the summit of\r\nthe Col de Lauteret, which divides the valley of the Romanche from\r\nthat of the Guisanne. The pastures along the mountain-side are of the\r\nrichest verdure; and so many rare and beautiful plants are found\r\ngrowing there that M. Rousillon has described it as a \"very botanical\r\nEden.\" Here Jean Jacques Rousseau delighted to herborize, and here the\r\ncelebrated botanist Mathonnet, originally a customs officer, born at\r\nthe haggard village of Villard d'Arene, which we have just passed,\r\ncultivated his taste for natural history, and laid the foundations of\r\nhis European reputation. The variety of temperature which exists along\r\nthe mountain-side, from the bottom to the summit, its exposure to the\r\nfull rays of the sun in some places, and its sheltered aspect in\r\nothers, facilitate the growth of an extraordinary variety of beautiful\r\nplants and wild flowers. In the low grounds meridional plants\r\nflourish; on the middle slopes those of genial climates; while on the\r\nsummit are found specimens of the flora of Lapland and Greenland. Thus\r\nalmost every variety of flowers is represented in this brilliant\r\nnatural garden--orchids, cruciferæ, leguminæ, rosaceæ, caryophyllæ,\r\nlilies of various kinds, saxifrages, anemones, ranunculuses, swertia,\r\nprimula, varieties of the sedum, some of which are peculiar to this\r\nmountain, and are elsewhere unknown.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the Hospice near the summit of the Col, the valley of\r\nthe Guisanne comes in sight, showing a line of bare and rugged\r\nmountains on the right hand and on the left, with a narrow strip of\r\nland in the bottom, in many parts strewn with stones carried down by\r\nthe avalanches from the cliffs above. Shortly we come in sight of the\r\ndistant ramparts of Briançon, apparently closing in the valley, the\r\nsnow-clad peak of Monte Viso rising in the distance. Halfway between\r\nthe Col and Briançon we pass through the village of Monestier, where,\r\nbeing a saint's day, the bulk of the population are in the street,\r\nholding festival. The place was originally a Roman station, and the\r\npeople still give indications of their origin, being extremely\r\nswarthy, black-haired, and large-eyed, evidently much more Italian\r\nthan French.\r\n\r\nBut though the villagers of Monestier were taking holiday, no one can\r\nreproach them with idleness. Never was there a more hard-working\r\npeople than the peasantry of these valleys. Every little patch of\r\nground that the plough or spade can be got into is turned to account.\r\nThe piles of stone and rock collected by the sides of the fields\r\ntestify to the industry of the people in clearing the soil for\r\nculture. And their farming is carried on in the face of difficulties\r\nand discouragements of no ordinary character, for sometimes the soil\r\nof many of the little farms will be swept away in a night by an\r\navalanche of snow in winter or of stones in spring. The wrecks of\r\nfields are visible all along the valley, especially at its upper part.\r\nLower down it widens, and affords greater room for culture; the sides\r\nof the mountains become better wooded; and, as we approach the\r\nfortress of Briançon, with its battlements seemingly piled one over\r\nthe other up the mountain-sides, the landscape becomes exceedingly\r\nbold and picturesque.\r\n\r\nWhen passing the village of Villeneuve la Salle, a few miles from\r\nBriançon, we were pointed to a spot on the opposite mountain-side,\r\nover the pathway leading to the Col de l'Echuada, where a cavern was\r\ndiscovered a few years since, which, upon examination, was found to\r\ncontain a considerable quantity of human bones. It was one of the\r\ncaves in which the hunted Vaudois were accustomed to take refuge\r\nduring the persecutions; and it continued to be called by the\r\npeasantry \"La Roche armée\"--the name being thus perpetuated, though\r\nthe circumstances in which it originated had been forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe fortress of Briançon, which we entered by a narrow winding roadway\r\nround the western rampart, is the frontier fortress which guards the\r\npass from Italy into France by the road over Mont Genèvre. It must\r\nalways have been a strong place by nature, overlooking as it does the\r\nvalley of the Durance on the one hand, and the mountain road from\r\nItaly on the other, while the river Clairée, running in a deep defile,\r\ncuts it off from the high ground to the south and east. The highest\r\npart of the town is the citadel, or Fort du Château, built upon a peak\r\nof rock on the site of the ancient castle. It was doubtless the\r\nnucleus round which the early town became clustered, until it filled\r\nthe lower plateau to the verge of the walls and battlements. There\r\nbeing no room for the town to expand, the houses are closely packed\r\ntogether and squeezed up, as it were, so as to occupy the smallest\r\npossible space. The streets are narrow, dark, gloomy, and steep, being\r\naltogether impassable for carriages. The liveliest sight in the place\r\nis a stream of pure water, that rushes down an open conduit in the\r\nmiddle of the principal street, which is exceedingly steep and narrow.\r\nThe town is sacrificed to the fortifications, which dominate\r\neverywhere. With the increasing range and power of cannon, they have\r\nbeen extended in all directions, until they occupy the flanks of the\r\nadjoining mountains and many of their summits, so that the original\r\ncastle now forms but a comparatively insignificant part of the\r\nfortress. The most important part of the population is the\r\nsoldiery--the red-trousered missionaries of \"civilisation,\" according\r\nto the gospel of Louis Napoleon, published a short time before our\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nOther missionaries, are, however, at work in the town and\r\nneighbourhood; and both at Briançon and Villeneuve Protestant stations\r\nhave been recently established, under the auspices of the Protestant\r\nSociety of Lyons. In former times, the population of Briançon included\r\na large number of Protestants. In the year 1575, three years after the\r\nmassacre of St. Bartholomew, they were so numerous and wealthy as to\r\nbe able to build a handsome temple, almost alongside the cathedral,\r\nand it still stands there in the street called Rue du Temple, with the\r\nmotto over the entrance, in old French, \"Cerches et vos troveres.\" But\r\nat the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the temple was seized by the\r\nKing and converted into a granary, and the Protestants of the place\r\nwere either executed, banished, or forced to conform to the Papal\r\nreligion. Since then the voice of Protestantism has been mute in\r\nBriançon until within the last few years, during which a mission has\r\nbeen in operation. Some of the leading persons in the town have\r\nembraced the Reform faith, amongst others the professor of literature\r\nin the public college; but he had no sooner acknowledged to the\r\nauthorities the fact of his conversion, than he was dismissed from his\r\noffice, though he has since been appointed to a more important\r\nprofession at Nice. The number of members is, however, as yet very\r\nsmall, and the mission has to contend with limited means, and to carry\r\non its operations in the face of many obstructions and difficulties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat are the prospects of the extension of Protestantism in France?\r\nVarious answers have been given to the question. Some think that the\r\nprevailing dissensions among French Protestants interpose a serious\r\nbarrier in the way of progress. Others, more hopeful, think, that\r\nthese divisions are only the indications of renewed life and vigour,\r\nof the friction of mind with mind, which evinces earnestness, and\r\ncannot fail to lead to increased activity and effort. The observations\r\nof a young Protestant pastor on this point are worth repeating.\r\n\"Protestantism,\" said he, \"is based on individualism: it recognises\r\nthe free action of the human mind; and so long as the mind acts freely\r\nthere will be controversy. The end of controversy is death. True,\r\nthere is much incredulity abroad; but the incredulity is occasioned by\r\nthe incredibilities of Popery. Let the ground once be cleared by free\r\ninquiry, and our Church will rise up amidst the ruins of superstition\r\nand unbelief, for man _must_ have religion; only it must be consistent\r\nwith reason on the one hand, and with Divine revelation on the other.\r\nI for one do not fear the fullest and freest inquiry, having the most\r\nperfect confidence in the triumph of the truth.\"\r\n\r\nIt is alleged by others that the bald form in which Protestantism is\r\nfor the most part presented abroad, is not conformable with the\r\n\"genius\" of the men of Celtic and Latin race. However this may be, it\r\nis too generally the case that where Frenchmen, like Italians and\r\nSpaniards, throw off Roman Catholicism, they do not stop at rejecting\r\nits superstitions, but reject religion itself. They find no\r\nintermediate standpoint in Protestantism, but fly off into the void of\r\nutter unbelief. The same tendency characterizes them in politics. They\r\nseem to oscillate between Cæsarism and Red Republicanism; aiming not\r\nat reform so much as revolution. They are averse to any _via media_.\r\nWhen they have tried constitutionalism, they have broken down. So it\r\nhas been with Protestantism, the constitutionalism of Christianity.\r\nThe Huguenots at one time constituted a great power in France; but\r\ndespotism in politics and religion proved too strong for them, and\r\nthey were persecuted, banished, and stamped for a time out of\r\nexistence, or at least out of sight.\r\n\r\nProtestantism was more successful in Germany. Was it because it was\r\nmore conformable to the \"genius\" of its people? When the Germans\r\n\"protested\" against the prevailing corruptions in the Church, they did\r\nnot seek to destroy it, but to reform it. They \"stood upon the old\r\nways,\" and sought to make them broader, straighter, and purer. They\r\nhave pursued the same course in politics. Cooler and less impulsive\r\nthan their Gallican neighbours, they have avoided revolutions, but are\r\nconstantly seeking reforms. Of this course England itself furnishes a\r\nnotable example.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly a remarkable fact, that the stronghold of\r\nProtestantism in France was recently to be found among the population\r\nof Germanic origin seated along the valley of the Rhine; whereas in\r\nthe western districts Protestantism is split up by the two\r\nirreconcilable parties of Evangelicals and Rationalists. At the same\r\ntime it should be borne in mind that Alsace did not become part of\r\nFrance until the year 1715, and that the Lutherans of that province\r\nwere never exposed to the ferocious persecutions to which the\r\nEvangelical Protestants of Old France were subjected, before as well\r\nas after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.\r\n\r\nIn Languedoc, in Dauphiny, and in the southern provinces generally,\r\nmen and women who professed Protestantism were liable to be hanged or\r\nsent to the galleys, down to nearly the end of the last century. A\r\nProtestant pastor who exercised his vocation did so at the daily peril\r\nof his life. Nothing in the shape of a Protestant congregation was\r\npermitted to exist, and if Protestants worshipped together, it was in\r\nsecret, in caves, in woods, among the hills, or in the \"Desert.\" Yet\r\nProtestantism nevertheless contrived to exist through this long dark\r\nperiod of persecution, and even to increase. And when at length it\r\nbecame tolerated, towards the close of the last century, the numbers\r\nof its adherents appeared surprising to those who had imagined it to\r\nbe altogether extinct.\r\n\r\nIndeed, looking at the persistent efforts made by Louis XIV. to\r\nexterminate the Huguenots, and to the fact that many hundred thousand\r\nof the best of them emigrated into foreign countries, while an equal\r\nnumber are supposed to have perished in prison, on the scaffold, at\r\nthe galleys, and in their attempts to escape, it may almost be\r\nregarded as matter of wonder that the Église Reformée--the Church of\r\nthe old Huguenots--should at the present day number about a thousand\r\ncongregations, besides the five hundred Lutheran congregations of\r\nAlsatia, and that the Protestants of France should amount, in the\r\nwhole, to about two millions of souls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nVAL LOUISE--HISTORY OF FELIX NEFF.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome eight miles south of Briançon, on the road to Fort Dauphin, a\r\nlittle river called the Gyronde comes down from the glaciers of Mont\r\nPelvoux, and falls into the Durance nearly opposite the village of La\r\nBessie. This river flows through Val Louise, the entrance into which\r\ncan be discerned towards the northwest. Near the junction of the\r\nrivers, the ruins of an embattled wall, with entrenchments, are\r\nobserved extending across the valley of the Durance, a little below\r\nthe narrow pass called the \"Pertuis-Rostan,\" evidently designed to\r\nclose it against an army advancing from the south. The country people\r\nstill call those ruins the \"Walls of the Vaudois;\"[101] and according\r\nto tradition a great Vaudois battle was fought there; but of any such\r\nbattle history makes no mention.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 101: A gap in the mountain-wall to the left, nearly\r\n         over La Bessie, is still known as \"La Porte de Hannibal,\"\r\n         through which, it is conjectured, that general led his army.\r\n         But opinion, which is much divided as to the route he took,\r\n         is more generally in favour of his marching up the Isère, and\r\n         passing into Italy by the Little St. Bernard.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, so far as can be ascertained, the Vaudois of Dauphiny rarely\r\nif ever fought battles. They were too few in number, too much\r\nscattered among the mountains, and too poor and ill-armed, to be able\r\nto contend against the masses of disciplined soldiery that were\r\noccasionally sent into the valleys. All that they did was to watch,\r\nfrom their mountain look-outs, their enemies' approach, and hide\r\nthemselves in caves; or flee up to the foot of the glaciers till they\r\nhad passed by. The attitude of the French Vaudois was thus for the\r\nmost part passive; and they very rarely, like the Italian Vaudois,\r\noffered any determined or organized resistance to persecution. Hence\r\nthey have no such heroic story to tell of battles and sieges and\r\nvictories. Their heroism was displayed in patience, steadfastness, and\r\nlong-suffering, rather than in resisting force by force; and they were\r\nusually ready to endure death in its most frightful forms rather than\r\nprove false to their faith.\r\n\r\nThe ancient people of these valleys formed part of the flock of the\r\nArchbishop of Embrun. But history exhibits him as a very cruel\r\nshepherd. Thus, in 1335, there appears this remarkable entry in the\r\naccounts current of the bailli of Embrun: \"Item, for persecuting the\r\nVaudois, eight sols and thirty deniers of gold,\" as if the persecution\r\nof the Vaudois had become a regular department of the public service.\r\nWhat was done with the Vaudois when they were seized and tried at\r\nEmbrun further appears from the records of the diocese. In 1348,\r\ntwelve of the inhabitants of Val Louise were strangled at Embrun by\r\nthe public executioner; and in 1393, a hundred and fifty inhabitants\r\nof the same valley were burned alive at the same place by order of the\r\nInquisitor Borelli. But the most fatal of all the events that befell\r\nthe inhabitants of Val Louise was that which occurred about a century\r\nlater, in 1488, when nearly the whole of the remaining population of\r\nthe valley were destroyed in a cavern near the foot of Mont Pelvoux.\r\n\r\nThis dreadful massacre was perpetrated by a French army, under the\r\ndirection of Albert Catanée, the papal legate. The army had been sent\r\ninto Piedmont with the object of subjugating or destroying the Vaudois\r\non the Italian side of the Alps, but had returned discomfited to\r\nBriançon, unable to effect their object. The legate then determined to\r\ntake his revenge by an assault upon the helpless and unarmed French\r\nVaudois, and suddenly directed his soldiers upon the valleys of\r\nFressinières and Louise. The inhabitants of the latter valley,\r\nsurprised, and unable to resist an army of some twenty thousand men,\r\nabandoned their dwellings, and made for the mountains with all haste,\r\naccompanied by their families, and driving their flocks before them.\r\nOn the slope of Mont Pelvoux, about a third of the way up, there was\r\nformerly a great cavern, on the combe of Capescure, called La\r\nBalme-Chapelle--though now nearly worn away by the disintegration of\r\nthe mountain-side--in which the poor hunted people contrived to find\r\nshelter. They built up the approaches to the cavern, filled the\r\nentrance with rocks, and considered themselves to be safe. But their\r\nconfidence proved fatal to them. The Count La Palud, who was in\r\ncommand of the troops, seeing that it was impossible to force the\r\nentrance, sent his men up the mountain provided with ropes; and fixing\r\nthem so that they should hang over the mouth of the cavern, a number\r\nof the soldiers slid down in full equipment, landing on the ledge\r\nright in front of the concealed Vaudois. Seized with a sudden panic,\r\nand being unarmed, many of them precipitated themselves over the rocks\r\nand were killed. The soldiers slaughtered all whom they could reach,\r\nafter which they proceeded to heap up wood at the cavern mouth which\r\nthey set on fire, and thus suffocated the remainder. Perrin says four\r\nhundred children were afterwards found in the cavern, stifled, in the\r\narms of their dead mothers, and that not fewer than three thousand\r\npersons were thus ruthlessly destroyed. The little property of the\r\nslaughtered peasants was ordered by the Pope's legate to be divided\r\namongst the vagabonds who had carried out his savage orders. The\r\npopulation having been thus exterminated, the district was settled\r\nanew some years later, in the reign of Louis XII., who gave his name\r\nto the valley; and a number of \"good and true Catholics,\" including\r\nmany goitres and idiots,[102] occupied the dwellings and possessed the\r\nlands of the slaughtered Vaudois. There is an old saying that \"the\r\nblood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church,\" but assuredly it does\r\nnot apply to Val Louise, where the primitive Christian Church has been\r\ncompletely extinguished.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 102: It has been noted that these unfortunates\r\n         abound most in the villages occupied by the new settlers.\r\n         Thus, of the population of the village of St. Crepin, in the\r\n         valley of the Durance, not fewer than one-tenth are deaf and\r\n         dumb, with a large proportion of idiots.]\r\n\r\nThere were other valleys in the same neighbourhood, whither we are now\r\nwending, where the persecution, though equally ferocious, proved less\r\ndestructive; the inhabitants succeeding in making their escape into\r\ncomparatively inaccessible places in the mountains before they could\r\nbe put to the sword. For instance, in Val Fressinières--also opening\r\ninto the valley of the Durance a little lower down than Val\r\nLouise--the Vaudois Church has never ceased to exist, and to this day\r\nthe majority of the inhabitants belong to it. From the earliest times\r\nthe people of the valley were distinguished for their \"heresy;\" and as\r\nearly as the fourteenth century eighty persons of Fressinières and\r\nthe neighbouring valley of Argentières,--willing to be martyrs rather\r\nthan apostates,--were burnt at Embrun because of their religion. In\r\nthe following century (1483) we find ninety-nine informations laid\r\nbefore John Lord Archbishop of Embrun against supposed heretics of Val\r\nFressinières. The suspected were ordered to wear a cross upon their\r\ndress, before and behind, and not to appear at church without\r\ndisplaying such crosses. But it further appears from the records,\r\nthat, instead of wearing the crosses, most of the persons so informed\r\nagainst fled into the mountains and hid themselves away in caves for\r\nthe space of five years.\r\n\r\nThe nest steps taken by the Archbishop are described in a Latin\r\nmanuscript,[103] of which the following is a translation:--\r\n\r\n     \"Also, that in consequence of the above, the monk Francis\r\n     Splireti, of the order of Mendicants, Professor in Theology, was\r\n     deputed in the quality of Inquisitor of the said valleys; and\r\n     that in the year 1489, on the 1st of January, knowing that those\r\n     of Freyssinier had relapsed into infamous heresy, and had not\r\n     obeyed their orders, nor carried the cross on their dress, but on\r\n     the contrary had received their excommunicated and banished\r\n     brethren without delivering them over to the Church, sent to them\r\n     new citation, to which not having appeared, an adjournment of\r\n     their condemnation as hardened heretics, when their goods would\r\n     be confiscated, and themselves handed over the secular power, was\r\n     made to the 28th of June; but they remaining more obstinate than\r\n     ever, so much so that no hope remains of bringing them back, all\r\n     persons were forbidden to hold any communication whatsoever with\r\n     them without permission of the Church, and it was ordered by the\r\n     Procureur Fiscal that the aforesaid Inquisitor do proceed,\r\n     without further notice, to the execution of his office.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 103: This was one of the MSS deposited by Samuel\r\n         Morland (Oliver Cromwell's ambassador to Piedmont) at\r\n         Cambridge in 1658, and is quoted by Jean Leger in his History\r\n         of the Vaudois Churches.]\r\n\r\nWhat the execution of the Inquisitor's office meant, is, alas! but too\r\nwell known. Bonds and imprisonment, scourgings and burnings at Embrun.\r\nThe poor people appealed to the King of France for help against their\r\npersecutors, but in vain. In 1498 the inhabitants of Fressinières\r\nappeared by a procurator at Paris, on the occasion of the new\r\nsovereign, Louis XII., ascending the throne. But as the King was then\r\nseeking the favour of a divorce from his wife, Anne of Brittany, from\r\nPope Alexander VI., he turned a deaf ear to their petition for mercy.\r\nOn the contrary, Louis confirmed all the decisions of the clergy, and\r\nin return for the divorce which he obtained, he granted to the Pope's\r\nson, the infamous Cæsar Borgia, that very part of Dauphiny inhabited\r\nby the Vaudois, together with the title of Duke of Valentinois. They\r\nhad appealed, as it were, to the tiger for mercy, and they were\r\nreferred to the vulture.\r\n\r\nThe persecution of the people of the valleys thus suffered no\r\nrelaxation, and all that remained for them was flight into the\r\nmountains, to places where they were most likely to remain unmolested.\r\nHence they fled up to the very edge of the glaciers, and formed their\r\nsettlements at almost the farthest limits of vegetation. There the\r\nbarrenness of the soil, the inhospitality of the climate, and the\r\ncomparative inaccessibility of their villages, proved their security.\r\nOf them it might be truly said, that they \"wandered about in\r\nsheepskins and goat-skins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented (of\r\nwhom the world was not worthy); they wandered in deserts and in\r\nmountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.\" Yet the character of\r\nthese poor peasants was altogether irreproachable. Even Louis XII.\r\nsaid of them, \"Would to God that I were as good a Christian as the\r\nworst of these people!\" The wonder is that, in the face of their\r\nlong-continued persecutions, extending over so many centuries, any\r\nremnant of the original population of the valleys should have been\r\npreserved. Long after the time of Louis XII. and Cæsar Borgia, the\r\nFrench historian, De Thou (writing in 1556), thus describes the people\r\nof Val Fressinières: \"Notwithstanding their squalidness, it is\r\nsurprising that they are very far from being uncultivated in their\r\nmorals. They almost all understand Latin; and are able to write fairly\r\nenough. They understand also as much of French as will enable them to\r\nread the Bible and to sing psalms; nor would you easily find a boy\r\namong them who, if he were questioned as to the religious opinions\r\nwhich they hold in common with the Waldenses, would not be able to\r\ngive from memory a reasonable account of them.\"[104]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 104: De Thou's History, book xxvii.]\r\n\r\nAfter the promulgation of the Edict of Nantes, the Vaudois enjoyed a\r\nbrief respite from their sufferings. They then erected temples,\r\nappointed ministers, and worshipped openly. This, however, only lasted\r\nfor a short time, and when the Edict was revoked, and persecution\r\nbegan again, in the reign of Louis XIV., their worship was suppressed\r\nwherever practicable. But though the Vaudois temples were pulled down\r\nand their ministers banished, the Roman Catholics failed to obtain a\r\nfooting in the valley. Some of the pastors continued to brave the fury\r\nof the persecutors, and wandered about from place to place among the\r\nscattered flocks, ministering to them at the peril of their lives.\r\nRewards were offered for their apprehension, and a sort of \"Hue and\r\nCry\" was issued by the police, describing their age, and height, and\r\nfeatures, as if they had been veritable criminals. And when they were\r\napprehended they were invariably hanged. As late as 1767 the\r\nparliament of Grenoble condemned their pastor Berenger to death for\r\ncontinuing to preach to congregations in the \"Desert.\"\r\n\r\nThis religious destitution of the Vaudois continued to exist until a\r\ncomparatively recent period. The people were without either pastors or\r\nteachers, and religion had become a tradition with them rather than an\r\nactive living faith. Still, though poor and destitute, they held to\r\ntheir traditional belief, and refused to conform to the dominant\r\nreligion. And so they continued until within the last forty years,\r\nwhen the fact of the existence of these remnants of the ancient\r\nVaudois in the valleys of the High Alps came to the knowledge of Felix\r\nNeff, and he determined to go to their help and devote himself to\r\ntheir service.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne would scarcely expect to find the apostle of the High Alps in the\r\nperson of a young Swiss soldier of artillery. Yet so it was. In his\r\nboyhood, Neff read Plutarch, which filled his mind with admiration of\r\nthe deeds of the great men of old. While passing through the soldier\r\nphase of his career the \"Memoirs of Oberlin\" accidentally came under\r\nhis notice, the perusal of which gave quite a new direction to his\r\nlife. Becoming impressed by religion, his ambition now was to be a\r\nmissionary. Leaving the army, in which he had reached the rank of\r\nsergeant at nineteen, he proceeded to prepare himself for the\r\nministry, and after studying for a time, and passing his preliminary\r\nexaminations, he was, in conformity with the custom of the Geneva\r\nChurch, employed on probation as a lay helper in parochial work. In\r\nthis capacity Neff first went to Mens, in the department of Isère,\r\nwhere he officiated in the absence of the regular pastor, as well as\r\noccasionally at Vizille, for a period of about two years.\r\n\r\nIt was while residing at Mens that the young missionary first heard of\r\nthe existence of the scattered communities of primitive Christians on\r\nthe High Alps, descendants of the ancient Vaudois; and his mind became\r\ninflamed with the desire of doing for them what Oberlin had done for\r\nthe poor Protestants of the Ban de la Roche. \"I am always dreaming of\r\nthe High Alps,\" he wrote to a friend, \"and I would rather be stationed\r\nthere than under the beautiful sky of Languedoc.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was first necessary that he should receive ordination for the\r\nministry; and accordingly in 1823, when in his twenty-fifth year, he\r\nleft Mens with that object. He did not, however, seek ordination by\r\nthe National Church of Geneva, which, in his opinion, had in a great\r\nmeasure ceased to hold Evangelical truth; but he came over to London,\r\nat the invitation of Mr. Cook and Mr. Wilks, two Congregational\r\nministers, by whom he was duly ordained a minister in the Independent\r\nChapel, Poultry.\r\n\r\nShortly after his return to France, Neff, much to his own\r\nsatisfaction, was invited as pastor to the very district in which he\r\nso much desired to minister--the most destitute in the High Alps.\r\nBefore setting out he wrote in his journal, \"To-morrow, with the\r\nblessing of God, I mean to push for the Alps by the sombre and\r\npicturesque valley of L'Oisan.\" After a few days, the young pastor was\r\nin the scene of his future labours; and he proceeded to explore hamlet\r\nafter hamlet in search of the widely-scattered flock committed to his\r\ncharge, and to arrange his plans for the working of his extensive\r\nparish.\r\n\r\nBut it was more than a parish, for it embraced several of the most\r\nextensive, rugged, and mountainous arrondissements of the High Alps.\r\nThough the whole number of people in his charge did not amount to more\r\nthan six or seven hundred, they lived at great distances from each\r\nother, the churches to which he ministered being in some cases as much\r\nas eighty miles apart, separated by gorges and mountain-passes, for\r\nthe most part impassable in winter. Neff's district extended in one\r\ndirection from Vars to Briançon, and in another from Champsaur in the\r\nvalley of the Drac to San Veran on the slope of Monte Viso, close to\r\nthe Italian frontier. His residence was fixed at La Chalp, above\r\nQueyras, but as he rarely slept more than three nights in one place,\r\nhe very seldom enjoyed its seclusion.\r\n\r\nThe labour which Neff imposed upon himself was immense; and it was\r\nespecially in the poorest and most destitute districts that he worked\r\nthe hardest. He disregarded alike the summer's heat and the winter's\r\ncold. His first visit to Dormilhouse, in Val Fressinières, was made in\r\nJanuary, when the mountain-paths were blocked with ice and snow; but,\r\nassembling the young men of the village, he went out with them armed\r\nwith hatchets, and cut steps in the ice to enable the worshippers from\r\nthe lower hamlets to climb up to service in the village church. The\r\npeople who first came to hear him preach at Violens brought wisps of\r\nstraw with them, which they lighted to guide them through the snow,\r\nwhile others, who had a greater distance to walk, brought pine\r\ntorches.\r\n\r\nNothing daunted, the valiant soldier, furnished with a stout staff and\r\nshod with heavy-nailed shoes, covered with linen socks to prevent\r\nslipping on the snow, would set out with his wallet on his back across\r\nthe Col d'Orcières in winter, in the track of the lynx and the\r\nchamois, with the snow and sleet beating against his face, to visit\r\nhis people on the other side of the mountain. His patience, his\r\nperseverance, his sweetness of temper, were unfailing. \"Ah!\" said one\r\nunbelieving Thomas of Val Fressinières in his mountain patois, \"you\r\nhave come among us like a woman who attempts to kindle a fire with\r\ngreen wood; she exhausts her breath in blowing it to keep the little\r\nflame alive, but the moment she quits it, it is instantly\r\nextinguished.\"\r\n\r\nNeff nevertheless laboured on with hope, and neither discouragement\r\nnor obstruction slackened his efforts. And such labours could not fail\r\nof their effect. He succeeded in inspiring the simple mountaineers\r\nwith his own zeal, he evoked their love, and excited their\r\nenthusiastic admiration. When he returned to Dormilhouse after a brief\r\nabsence, the whole village would turn out and come down the mountain\r\nto meet and embrace him. \"The rocks, the cascades, nay, the very\r\nglaciers,\" he wrote to a friend, \"all seemed animated, and presented a\r\nsmiling aspect; the savage country became agreeable and dear to me\r\nfrom the moment its inhabitants were my brethren.\"\r\n\r\nUnresting and indefatigable, Neff was always at work. He exhorted the\r\npeople in hovels, held schools in barns in which he taught the\r\nchildren, and catechised them in stables. His hand was in every good\r\nwork. He taught the people to sing, he taught them to read, he taught\r\nthem to pray. To be able to speak to them familiarly, he learnt their\r\nnative patois, and laboured at it like a schoolboy. He worked as a\r\nmissionary among savages. The poor mountaineers had been so long\r\ndestitute of instruction, that everything had as it were to be begun\r\nwith them from the beginning. Sharing in their hovels and stables,\r\nwith their squalor and smoke, he taught them how to improve them by\r\nadding chimneys and windows, and showed how warmth might be obtained\r\nmore healthfully than by huddling together in winter-time with the\r\ncattle. He taught them manners, and especially greater respect for\r\nwomen, inculcating the lesson by his own gentleness and tender\r\ndeference. Out of doors, he showed how they might till the ground to\r\ngreater advantage, and introduced an improved culture of the potato,\r\nwhich more than doubled the production. Observing how the pastures of\r\nDormilhouse were scorched by the summer sun, he urged the adoption of\r\na system of irrigation. The villagers were at first most obstinate in\r\ntheir opposition to his plans; but he persevered, laid out a canal,\r\nand succeeded at last in enlisting a body of workmen, whom he led out,\r\npickaxe in hand, himself taking a foremost part in the work; and at\r\nlast the waters were let into the canal amidst joy and triumph. At\r\nViolens he helped to build and finish the chapel, himself doing\r\nmason-work, smith-work, and carpenter-work by turns. At Dormilhouse a\r\nschool was needed, and he showed the villagers how to build one;\r\npreparing the design, and taking part in the erection, until it was\r\nfinished and ready for use. In short, he turned his hand to\r\neverything--nothing was too high or too low for this noble citizen of\r\ntwo worlds. At length, a serious accident almost entirely disabled\r\nhim. While on one of his mountain journeys, he was making a détour\r\namongst a mass of rocky débris, to avoid the dangers of an avalanche,\r\nwhen he had the misfortune to fall and severely sprain his knee. He\r\nbecame laid up for a time, and when able to move, he set out for his\r\nmother's home at Geneva, in the hope of recovering health and\r\nstrength; for his digestive powers were also by this time seriously\r\ninjured. When he went away, the people of the valleys felt as if they\r\nshould never see him more; and their sorrow at his departure was\r\nheart-rending. After trying the baths of Plombiéres without effect, he\r\nproceeded onwards to Geneva, which he reached only to die; and thus\r\nthis good and noble soldier--one of the bravest of earth's\r\nheroes--passed away to his eternal reward at the early age of\r\nthirty-one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe valley of Fressinières--the principle scene of Neff's\r\nlabours--joins the valley of the Durance nearly opposite the little\r\nhamlet of La Roche. There we leave the high road from Briançon to Fort\r\nDauphin, and crossing the river by a timber bridge, ascend the steep\r\nmountain-side by a mule path, in order to reach the entrance to the\r\nvalley of Fressinières, the level of which is high above that of the\r\nDurance. Not many years since, the higher valley could only be\r\napproached from this point by a very difficult mountain-path amidst\r\nrocks and stones, called the Ladder, or Pas de l'Échelle. It was\r\ndangerous at all times, and quite impassable in winter. The mule-path\r\nwhich has lately been made, though steep, is comparatively easy.\r\n\r\nWhat the old path was, and what were the discomforts of travelling\r\nthrough this district in Neff's time, may be appreciated on a perusal\r\nof the narrative of the young pastor Bost, who in 1840 determined to\r\nmake a sort of pilgrimage to the scenes of his friend's labours some\r\nseventeen years before. M. Bost, however, rather exaggerates the\r\ndifficulties and discomforts of the valleys than otherwise. He saw no\r\nbeauty nor grandeur in the scenery, only \"horrible mountains in a\r\nstate of dissolution\" and constantly ready to fall upon the heads of\r\nmassing travellers. He had no eyes for the picturesque though gloomy\r\nlake of La Roche, but saw only the miserable hamlet itself. He slept\r\nin the dismal little inn, as doubtless Neff had often done before, and\r\nwas horrified by the multitudinous companions that shared his bed;\r\nand, tumbling out, he spent the rest of the night on the floor. The\r\nfood was still worse--cold _café noir_, and bread eighteen months old,\r\nsoaked in water before it could be eaten. His breakfast that morning\r\nmade him ill for a week. Then his mounting up the Pas de l'Échelle,\r\nwhich he did not climb \"without profound emotion,\" was a great trouble\r\nto him. Of all this we find not a word in the journals or letters of\r\nNeff, whose early life as a soldier had perhaps better inured him to\r\n\"roughing it\" than the more tender bringing-up of Pastor Bost.\r\n\r\nAs we rounded the shoulder of the hill, almost directly overlooking\r\nthe ancient Roman town of Rama in the valley of the Durance\r\nunderneath, we shortly came in sight of the little hamlet of Palons, a\r\ngroup of \"peasants' nests,\" overhung by rocks, with the one good house\r\nin it, the comfortable parsonage of the Protestant pastor, situated at\r\nthe very entrance to the valley. Although the peasants' houses which\r\nconstitute the hamlet of Palons are still very poor and miserable, the\r\nplace has been greatly improved since Neff's time, by the erection of\r\nthe parsonage. It was found that the pastors who were successively\r\nappointed to minister to the poor congregations in the valley very\r\nsoon became unfitted for their work by the hardships to which they\r\nwere exposed; and being without any suitable domestic accommodation,\r\none after another of them resigned their charge.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this defect, a movement was begun in 1852 by the Rev. Mr.\r\nFreemantle, rector of Claydon, Bucks, assisted by the Foreign Aid\r\nSociety and a few private friends, with the object of providing\r\npastors' dwellings, as well as chapels when required, in the more\r\ndestitute places. The movement has already been attended with\r\nconsiderable success; and among its first results was the erection in\r\n1857 of the comfortable parsonage of Palons, the large lower room of\r\nwhich also serves the purpose of a chapel. The present incumbent is M.\r\nCharpiot, of venerable and patriarchal aspect, whose white hairs are a\r\ncrown of glory--a man beloved by his extensive flock, for his parish\r\nembraces the whole valley, about twelve miles in extent, including the\r\nfour villages of Ribes, Violens, Minsals, and Dormilhouse; other\r\npastors having been appointed of late years to the more distant\r\nstations included in the original widely-scattered charge of Felix\r\nNeff.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the parsonage and adjoining grounds at Palons is\r\ncharmingly picturesque. It stands at the entrance to the defile which\r\nleads into Val Fressinières, having a background of bold rocks\r\nenclosing a mountain plateau known as the \"Camp of Catinat,\" a\r\nnotorious persecutor of the Vaudois. In front of the parsonage extends\r\na green field planted with walnut and other trees, part of which is\r\nwalled off as the burying-ground of the hamlet. Alongside, in a deep\r\nrocky gully, runs the torrent of the Biasse, leaping from rock to rock\r\non its way to the valley of the Durance, far below. This fall, or\r\ncataract, is not inappropriately named the \"Gouffouran,\" or roaring\r\ngulf; and its sullen roar is heard all through the night in the\r\nadjoining parsonage. The whole height of the fall, as it tumbles from\r\nrock to rock, is about four hundred and fifty feet; and about halfway\r\ndown, the water shoots into a deep, dark cavern, where it becomes\r\ncompletely lost to sight.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the hamlet are a poor hard-working people, pursuing\r\ntheir industry after very primitive methods. Part of the Biasse, as it\r\nissues from the defile, is turned aside here and there to drive little\r\nfulling-mills of the rudest construction, where the people \"waulk\" the\r\ncloth of their own making. In the adjoining narrow fields overhanging\r\nthe Gouffouran, where the ploughs are at work, the oxen are yoked to\r\nthem in the old Roman fashion, the pull being by a bar fixed across\r\nthe animals' foreheads.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Palons, as at various other places in the\r\nvalley, there are numerous caverns which served by turns in early\r\ntimes as hiding-places and as churches, and which were not\r\nunfrequently consecrated by the Vaudois with their blood. One of these\r\nis still known as the \"Glesia,\" or \"Église.\" Its opening is on the\r\ncrest of a frightful precipice, but its diameter has of late years\r\nbeen considerably reduced by the disintegration of the adjoining rock.\r\nNeff once took Captain Cotton up to see it, and chanted the _Te Deum_\r\nin the rude temple with great emotion.\r\n\r\nPalons is, perhaps, the most genial and fertile spot in the valley; it\r\nlooks like a little oasis in the desert. Indeed, Neff thought the soil\r\nof the place too rich for the growth of piety. \"Palons,\" said he in\r\nhis journal, \"is more fertile than the rest of the valley, and even\r\nproduces wine: the consequence is, that there is less piety here.\"\r\nNeff even entertained the theory that the poorer the people the\r\ngreater was their humility and fervour, and the less their selfishness\r\nand spiritual pride. Thus, he considered \"the fertility of the commune\r\nof Champsaur, and its proximity to the high road and to Gap, great\r\nstumbling-blocks.\" The loftiest, coldest, and most barren spots--such\r\nas San Veran and Dormilhouse--were, in his opinion, by far the most\r\npromising. Of the former he said, \"It is the highest, and consequently\r\nthe most pious, village in the valley of Queyras;\" and of the\r\ninhabitants of the latter he said, \"From the first moment of my\r\narrival I took them to my heart, and I ardently desired to be unto\r\nthem even as another Oberlin.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE VAUDOIS MOUNTAIN-REFUGE OF DORMILHOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe valley of Fressinières could never have maintained a large\r\npopulation. Though about twelve miles in extent, it contains a very\r\nsmall proportion of arable land--only a narrow strip, of varying\r\nwidth, lying in the bottom, with occasional little patches of\r\ncultivated ground along the mountain-sides, where the soil has settled\r\non the ledges, the fields seeming in many cases to hang over\r\nprecipices. At the upper end of the valley, the mountains come down so\r\nclose to the river Biasse that no space is left for cultivation, and\r\nthe slopes are so rocky and abrupt as to be unavailable even for\r\npasturage, excepting of goats.\r\n\r\nYet the valley seems never to have been without a population, more or\r\nless numerous according to the rigour of the religious persecutions\r\nwhich prevailed in the neighbourhood. Its comparative inaccessibility,\r\nits inhospitable climate, and its sterility, combined to render it one\r\nof the most secure refuges of the Vaudois in the Middle Ages. It could\r\nneither be easily entered by an armed force, nor permanently occupied\r\nby them. The scouts on the hills overlooking the Durance could always\r\nsee their enemies approach, and the inhabitants were enabled to take\r\nrefuge in caves in the mountain-sides, or flee to the upper parts of\r\nthe valley, before the soldiers could clamber up the steep Pas de\r\nl'Échelle, and reach the barricaded defile through which the Biasse\r\nrushes down the rocky gorge of the Gouffouran. When the invaders\r\nsucceeded in penetrating this barrier, they usually found the hamlets\r\ndeserted and the people fled. They could then only wreak their\r\nvengeance on the fields, which they laid waste, and on the dwellings,\r\nwhich they burned; and when the \"brigands\" had at length done their\r\nworst and departed, the poor people crept back to their ruined homes\r\nto pray, amidst their ashes, for strength to enable them to bear the\r\nheavy afflictions which they were thus called upon to suffer for\r\nconscience' sake.\r\n\r\nThe villages in the lower part of the valley were thus repeatedly\r\nravaged and destroyed. But far up, at its extremest point, a difficult\r\nfootpath led, across the face almost of a precipice, which the\r\npersecutors never ventured to scale, to the hamlet of Dormilhouse,\r\nseated on a few ledges of rock on a lofty mountain-side, five thousand\r\nfeet above the level of the sea; and this place, which was for\r\ncenturies a mountain fastness of the persecuted, remains a Vaudois\r\nsettlement to this day.\r\n\r\nAn excursion to this interesting mountain hamlet having been arranged,\r\nour little party of five persons set out for the place on the morning\r\nof the 1st of July, under the guidance of Pastor Charpiot. Though the\r\nmorning was fine and warm, yet, as the place of our destination was\r\nsituated well up amongst the clouds, we were warned to provide\r\nourselves with umbrellas and waterproofs, nor did the provision prove\r\nin vain. We were also warned that there was an utter want of\r\naccommodation for visitors at Dormilhouse, for which we must be\r\nprepared. The words scratched on the window of the Norwegian inn\r\nmight indeed apply to it: \"Here the stranger may find very good\r\nentertainment--_provided he bring it with him_!\" We accordingly\r\ncarried our entertainment with us, in the form of a store of blankets,\r\nbread, chocolate, and other articles, which, with the traveller's\r\nknapsacks, were slung across the back of a donkey.\r\n\r\nAfter entering the defile, an open part of the valley was passed,\r\namidst which the little river, at present occupying very narrow\r\nlimits, meandered; but it was obvious from the width of the channel\r\nand the débris widely strewn about, that in winter it is a roaring\r\ntorrent. A little way up we met an old man coming down driving a\r\nloaded donkey, with whom one of our party, recognising him as an old\r\nacquaintance, entered into conversation. In answer to an inquiry made\r\nas to the progress of the good cause in the valley, the old man\r\nreplied very despondingly. \"There was,\" he said, \"a great lack of\r\nfaith, of zeal, of earnestness, amongst the rising generation. They\r\nwere too fond of pleasures, too apt to be led away by the fleeting\r\nvanities of this world.\" It was only the old story--the complaint of\r\nthe aged against the young. When this old peasant was a boy, his\r\nelders doubtless thought and said the same of him. The generation\r\ngrowing old always think the generation still young in a state of\r\ndegeneracy. So it was forty years since, when Felix Neff was amongst\r\nthem, and so it will be forty years hence. One day Neff met an old man\r\nnear Mens, who recounted to him the story of the persecutions which\r\nhis parents and himself had endured, and he added: \"In those times\r\nthere was more zeal than there is now; my father and mother used to\r\ncross mountains and forests by night, in the worst weather, at the\r\nrisk of their lives, to be present at divine service performed in\r\nsecret; but now we are grown lazy: religious freedom is the deathblow\r\nto piety.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour's walking brought us to the principal hamlet of the commune,\r\nformerly called Fressinières, but now known as Les Ribes, occupying a\r\nwooded height on the left bank of the river. The population is partly\r\nRoman Catholic and partly Protestant. The Roman Catholics have a\r\nchurch here, the last in the valley, the two other places of worship\r\nhigher up being Protestant. The principal person of Les Ribes is M.\r\nBaridon, son of the Joseph Baridon, receiver of the commune, so often\r\nmentioned with such affection in the journal of Neff. He is the only\r\nperson in the valley whose position and education give him a claim to\r\nthe title of \"Monsieur;\" and his house contains the only decent\r\napartment in the Val Fressinières where pastors and visitors could be\r\nlodged previous to the erection, by Mr. Freemantle, of the pleasant\r\nlittle parsonage at Palons. This apartment in the Baridons' house Neff\r\nused to call the \"Prophet's Chamber.\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour higher up the valley we reached the hamlet of Violens,\r\nwhere all the inhabitants are Protestants. It was at this place that\r\nNeff helped to build and finish the church, for which he designed the\r\nseats and pulpit, and which he opened and dedicated on the 29th of\r\nAugust, 1824, the year before he finally left the neighbourhood.\r\nViolens is a poor hamlet situated at the bottom of a deep glen, or\r\nrocky abyss, called La Combe; the narrow valleys of Dauphiny, like\r\nthose of Devon, being usually called combes, doubtless from the same\r\noriginal Celtic word _cwm_, signifying a hollow or dingle.\r\n\r\nA little above Violens the valley contracts almost to a ravine, until\r\nwe reach the miserable hamlet of Minsals, so shut in by steep crags\r\nthat for nine months of the year it never sees the sun, and during\r\nseveral months in winter it lies buried in snow. The hamlet consists\r\nfor the most part of hovels of mud and stone, without windows or\r\nchimneys, being little better than stables; indeed, in winter time,\r\nfor the sake of warmth, the poor people share them with their cattle.\r\nHow they contrive to scrape a living out of the patches of soil\r\nrescued from the rocks, or hung upon the precipices on the\r\nmountain-side, is a wonder.\r\n\r\nOne of the horrors of this valley consists in the constant state of\r\ndisintegration of the adjoining rocks, which, being of a slaty\r\nformation, frequently break away in large masses, and are hurled into\r\nthe lower grounds. This, together with the fall of avalanches in\r\nwinter, makes the valley a most perilous place to live in. A little\r\nabove Minsals, only a few years since, a tremendous fall of rock and\r\nmud swept over nearly the whole of the cultivated ground, since which\r\nmany of the peasantry have had to remove elsewhere. What before was a\r\nwell-tilled meadow, is now only a desolate waste, covered with rocks\r\nand débris.\r\n\r\nAnother of the horrors of the place is its liability to floods, which\r\ncome rushing down, from the mountains, and often work sad havoc.\r\nSometimes a fall of rocks from the cliffs above dams up the bed of the\r\nriver, when a lake accumulates behind the barrier until it bursts, and\r\nthe torrent swoops down the valley, washing away fields, and bridges,\r\nand mills, and hovels.\r\n\r\nEven the stouter-built dwelling of M. Baridon at Les Ribes was nearly\r\ncarried away by one of such inundations twelve years ago. It stands\r\nabout a hundred yards from the mountain-stream which comes down from\r\nthe Pic de la Séa. One day in summer a storm burst over the mountain,\r\nand the stream at once became swollen to a torrent. The inmates of the\r\ndwelling thought the house must eventually be washed away, and gave\r\nthemselves up to prayer. The flood, bearing with it rolling rocks,\r\ncame nearer and nearer, until it reached a few old walnut trees on a\r\nline with the torrent. A rock of some thirty feet square tumbled\r\nagainst one of the trees, which staggered and bent, but held fast and\r\nstopped the rock. The débris at once rolled upon it into a bank, the\r\ncourse of the torrent was turned, and the dwelling and its inmates\r\nwere saved.\r\n\r\nAnother incident, illustrative of the perils of daily life in Val\r\nFressinières, was related to me by Mr. Milsom while passing the scene\r\nof one of the mud and rock avalanches so common in the valley. Etienne\r\nBaridon, a member of the same Les Ribes family, an intelligent young\r\nman, disabled for ordinary work by lameness and deformity, occupied\r\nhimself in teaching the children in the Protestant school at Violens,\r\nwhither he walked daily, accompanied by the pupils from Les Ribes. One\r\nday, a heavy thunderstorm burst over the valley, and sent down an\r\navalanche of mud, débris, and boulders, which rolled quite across the\r\nvalley and extended to the river. The news of the circumstance reached\r\nEtienne when in school at Violens; the road to Les Ribes was closed;\r\nand he was accordingly urged to stay over the night with the children.\r\nBut thinking of the anxiety of their parents, he determined to guide\r\nthem back over the fall of rocks if possible. Arrived at the place, he\r\nfound the mass still on the move, rolling slowly down in a ridge of\r\nfrom ten to twenty feet high, towards the river. Supported by a stout\r\nstaff; the lame Baridon took first one child and then another upon\r\nhis hump-back; and contrived to carry them across in safety; but while\r\nmaking his last journey with the last child, his foot slipped and his\r\nleg got badly crushed among the still-rolling stones. He was, however,\r\nable to extricate himself, and reached Les Ribes in safety with all\r\nthe children. \"This Etienne,\" concluded Mr. Milsom, \"was really a\r\nnoble fellow, and his poor deformed body covered the soul of a hero.\"\r\n\r\nAt length, after a journey of about ten miles up this valley of the\r\nshadow of death, along which the poor persecuted Vaudois were so often\r\nhunted, we reached an apparent _cul-de-sac_ amongst the mountains,\r\nbeyond which further progress seemed impracticable. Precipitous rocks,\r\nwith their slopes of débris at foot, closed in the valley all round,\r\nexcepting only the narrow gullet by which we had come; but, following\r\nthe footpath, a way up the mountain-side gradually disclosed itself--a\r\nzigzag up the face of what seemed to be a sheer precipice--and this we\r\nwere told was the road to Dormilhouse. The zigzag path is known as the\r\nTourniquet. The ascent is long, steep, and fatiguing. As we passed up,\r\nwe observed that the precipice contained many narrow ledges upon which\r\nsoil has settled, or to which it has been carried. Some of these are\r\nvery narrow, only a few yards in extent, but wherever there is room\r\nfor a spade to turn, the little patches bear marks of cultivation; and\r\nthese are the fields of the people of Dormilhouse!\r\n\r\nFar up the mountain, the footpath crosses in front of a lofty\r\ncascade--La Pisse du Dormilhouse--which leaps from the summit of the\r\nprecipice, and sometimes dashes over the roadway itself. Looking down\r\ninto the valley from this point, we see the Biasse meandering like a\r\nthread in the hollow of the mountains, becoming lost to sight in the\r\nravine near Minsals. We have now ascended to a great height, and the\r\nair feels cold and raw. When we left Palons, the sun was shining\r\nbrightly, and its heat was almost oppressive, but now the temperature\r\nfeels wintry. On our way up, rain began to fall; as we ascended the\r\nTourniquet the rain became changed to sleet; and at length, on\r\nreaching the summit of the rising ground from which we first discerned\r\nthe hamlet of Dormilhouse, on the first day of July, the snow was\r\nfalling heavily, and all the neighbouring mountains were clothed in\r\nthe garb of winter.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the famous mountain fastness of the Vaudois--their last\r\nand loftiest and least accessible retreat when hunted from their\r\nsettlements in the lower valleys hundreds of years ago. Driven from\r\nrock to rock, from Alp to Alp, they clambered up on to this lofty\r\nmountain-ledge, five thousand feet high, and made good their\r\nsettlement, though at the daily peril of their lives. It was a place\r\nof refuge, a fortress and citadel of the faithful, where they\r\ncontinued to worship God according to conscience during the long dark\r\nages of persecution and tyranny. The dangers and terrors of the\r\nsituation are indeed so great, that it never could have been chosen\r\neven for a hiding-place, much less for a permanent abode, but from the\r\ndirest necessity. What the poor people suffered while establishing\r\nthemselves on these barren mountain heights no one can tell, but they\r\ncontrived at length to make the place their home, and to become inured\r\nto their hard life, until it became almost a second nature to them.\r\n\r\nThe hamlet of Dormilhouse is said to have existed for nearly six\r\nhundred years, during which the religion of its inhabitants has\r\nremained the same. It has been alleged that the people are the\r\ndescendants of a colony of refugee Lombards; but M. Muston, and others\r\nwell able to judge, after careful inquiry on the spot, have come to\r\nthe conclusion that they bear all the marks of being genuine\r\ndescendants of the ancient Vaudois. In features, dress, habits, names,\r\nlanguage, and religious doctrine, they have an almost perfect identity\r\nwith the Vaudois of Piedmont at the present day.\r\n\r\nDormilhouse consists of about forty cottages, inhabited by some two\r\nhundred persons. The cottages are perched \"like eagles' nests,\" one\r\ntier ranging over another on the rocky ledges of a steep\r\nmountain-side. There is very little soil capable of cultivation in the\r\nneighbourhood, but the villagers seek out little patches in the valley\r\nbelow and on the mountain shelves, from which they contrive to grow a\r\nlittle grain for home use. The place is so elevated and so exposed,\r\nthat in some seasons even rye will not ripen at Dormilhouse, while the\r\npasturages are in many places inaccessible to cattle, and scarcely\r\nsafe for sheep.\r\n\r\nThe principal food of the people is goats' milk and unsifted rye,\r\nwhich they bake into cakes in the autumn, and these cakes last them\r\nthe whole year--the grain, if left unbaked, being apt to grow mouldy\r\nand spoil in so damp an atmosphere. Besides, fuel is so scarce that it\r\nis necessary to exercise the greatest economy in its use, every stick\r\nburnt in the village having to be brought from a distance of some\r\ntwelve miles, on the backs of donkeys, by the steep mountain-path\r\nleading up to the hamlet. Hence, also, the unsavoury means which they\r\nare under the necessity of adopting to economize warmth in the winter,\r\nby stabling the cattle with themselves in the cottages. The huts are\r\nfor the most part wretched constructions of stone and mud, from which\r\nfresh air, comfort, and cleanliness seem to be entirely excluded.\r\nExcepting that the people are for the most part comfortably dressed,\r\nin clothing of coarse wool, which they dress and weave themselves,\r\ntheir domestic accommodation and manner of living are centuries behind\r\nthe age; and were a stranger suddenly to be set down in the village,\r\nhe could with difficulty be made to believe that he was in the land of\r\ncivilised Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nThe place is dreary, stern, and desolate-looking even in summer. Thus,\r\nwe entered it with the snow falling on the 1st of July! Few of the\r\nbalmy airs of the sweet South of France breathe here. In the hollow of\r\nthe mountains the heat may be like that of an oven; but here, far up\r\non the heights, though the air may be fresh and invigorating at times,\r\nwhen the wind blows it often rises to a hurricane. Here the summer\r\ncomes late and departs early. While flowers are blooming in the\r\nvalleys, not a bud or blade of corn is to be seen at Dormilhouse. At\r\nthe season when vegetation is elsewhere at its richest, the dominant\r\nfeatures of the landscape are barrenness and desolation. The very\r\nshapes of the mountains are rugged, harsh, and repulsive. Right over\r\nagainst the hamlet, separated from it by a deep gully, rises up the\r\ngrim, bare Gramusac, as black as a wall, but along the ledges of\r\nwhich, the hunters of Dormilhouse, who are very daring and skilful, do\r\nnot fear to stalk the chamois.\r\n\r\nBut if the place is thus stern and even appalling in summer, what must\r\nit be in winter? There is scarcely a habitation in the village that is\r\nnot exposed to the danger of being carried away by avalanches or\r\nfalling rocks. The approach to the mountain is closed by ice and\r\nsnow, while the rocks are all tapestried with icicles. The\r\n_tourmente_, or snow whirlwind, occasionally swoops up the valley,\r\ntears the roofs from the huts, and scatters them in destruction.\r\n\r\nHere is a passage from Neff's journal, vividly descriptive of winter\r\nlife at Dormilhouse:--\r\n\r\n     \"The weather has been rigorous in the extreme; the falls of snow\r\n     are very frequent, and when it becomes a little milder, a general\r\n     thaw takes place, and our hymns are often sung amid the roar of\r\n     the avalanches, which, gliding along the smooth face of the\r\n     glacier, hurl themselves from precipice to precipice, like vast\r\n     cataracts of silver.\"\r\n\r\nWriting in January, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"We have been buried in four feet of snow since of 1st of\r\n     November. At this very moment a terrible blast is whirling the\r\n     snow in thick blinding clouds. Travelling is exceedingly\r\n     difficult and even dangerous among these valleys, particularly in\r\n     the neighbourhood of Dormilhouse, by reason of the numerous\r\n     avalanches falling everywhere.... One Sunday evening our scholars\r\n     and many of the Dormilhouse people, when returning home after the\r\n     sermon at Violens, narrowly escaped an avalanche. It rolled\r\n     through a narrow defile between two groups of persons: a few\r\n     seconds sooner or later, and it would have plunged the flower of\r\n     our youth into the depths of an unfathomable gorge.... In fact,\r\n     there are very few habitations in these parts which are not\r\n     liable to be swept away, for there is not a spot in the narrow\r\n     corner of the valley which can be considered absolutely safe. But\r\n     terrible as their situation is, they owe to it their religion,\r\n     and perhaps their physical existence. If their country had been\r\n     more secure and more accessible, they would have been\r\n     exterminated like the inhabitants of Val Louise.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the interesting though desolate mountain hamlet to the service\r\nof whose hardy inhabitants the brave Felix Neff devoted himself during\r\nthe greater part of his brief missionary career. It was characteristic\r\nof him to prefer to serve them because their destitution was greater\r\nthan that which existed in any other quarter of his extensive parish;\r\nand he turned from the grand mountain scenery of Arvieux and his\r\ncomfortable cottage at La Chalp, to spend his winters in the dismal\r\nhovels and amidst the barren wastes of Dormilhouse.\r\n\r\nWhen Neff first went amongst them, the people were in a state of\r\nalmost total spiritual destitution. They had not had any pastor\r\nstationed amongst them for nearly a hundred and fifty years. During\r\nall that time they had been without schools of any kind, and\r\ngeneration after generation had grown up and passed away in ignorance.\r\nYet with all the inborn tenacity of their race, they had throughout\r\nrefused to conform to the dominant religion. They belonged to the\r\nVaudois Church, and repudiated Romanism.\r\n\r\nThere was probably a Protestant church existing at Dormilhouse\r\nprevious to the Revocation, as is shown by the existence of an ancient\r\nVaudois church-bell, which was hid away until of late years, when it\r\nwas dug up and hung in the belfry of the present church. In 1745, the\r\nRoman Catholics endeavoured to effect a settlement in the place, and\r\nthen erected the existing church, with a residence for the curé. But\r\nthe people, though they were on the best of terms with the curé,\r\nrefused to enter his church. During the twenty years that he\r\nministered there, it is said the sole congregation consisted of his\r\ndomestic servant, who assisted him at mass.\r\n\r\nThe story is still told of the curé bringing up from Les Ribes a large\r\nbag of apples--an impossible crop at Dormilhouse--by way of tempting\r\nthe children to come to him and receive instruction. But they went\r\nonly so long as the apples lasted, and when they were gone the\r\nchildren disappeared. The curé complained that during the whole time\r\nhe had been in the place he had not been able to get a single person\r\nto cross himself. So, finding he was not likely to be of any use\r\nthere, he petitioned his bishop to be allowed to leave; on which, his\r\nrequest being complied with, the church was closed.\r\n\r\nThis continued until the period of the French Revolution, when\r\nreligious toleration became recognised. The Dormilhouse people then\r\ntook possession of the church. They found in it several dusty images,\r\nthe basin for the holy water, the altar candlesticks, and other\r\nfurniture, just as the curé had left them many years before; and they\r\nare still preserved as curiosities. The new occupants of the church\r\nwhitewashed the pictures, took down the crosses, dug up the old\r\nVaudois bell and hung it up in the belfry, and rang the villagers\r\ntogether to celebrate the old worship again. But they were still in\r\nwant of a regular minister until the period when Felix Neff settled\r\namongst them. A zealous young preacher, Henry Laget, had before then\r\npaid them a few visits, and been warmly welcomed; and when, in his\r\nlast address, he told them they would see his face no more, \"it\r\nseemed,\" said a peasant who related the incident to Neff, \"as if a\r\ngust of wind had extinguished the torch which was to light us in our\r\npassage by night across the precipice.\" And even Neff's ministry, as\r\nwe have above seen, only lasted for the short space of about three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nSome years after the death of Neff, another attempt was made by the\r\nRoman Catholics to establish a mission at Dormilhouse. A priest went\r\nup from Les Ribes accompanied by a sister of mercy from Gap--\"the\r\npearl of the diocese,\" she was called--who hired a room for the\r\npurpose of commencing a school. To give _éclat_ to their enterprise,\r\nthe Archbishop of Embrun himself went up, clothed in a purple dress,\r\nriding a white horse, and accompanied by a party of men bearing a\r\ngreat red cross, which he caused to be set up at the entrance to the\r\nvillage. But when the archbishop appeared, not a single inhabitant\r\nwent out to meet him; they had all assembled in the church to hold a\r\nprayer-meeting, and it lasted during the whole period of his visit.\r\nAll that he accomplished was to set up the great red cross, after\r\nwhich he went down the Tourniquet again; and shortly after, the priest\r\nand the sister of mercy, finding they could not obtain a footing, also\r\nleft the village. Somehow or other, the red cross which had been set\r\nup mysteriously disappeared, but how it had been disposed of no one\r\nwould ever reveal. It was lately proposed to commemorate the event of\r\nthe archbishop's visit by the erection of an obelisk on the spot where\r\nhe had set up the red cross; and a tablet, with a suitable\r\ninscription, was provided for it by the Rev. Mr. Freemantle, of\r\nClaydon. But when he was told that the site was exposed to the full\r\nforce of the avalanches descending from the upper part of the mountain\r\nin winter, and would speedily be swept away, the project of the\r\nmemorial pillar was abandoned, and the tablet was inserted, instead,\r\nin the front wall of the village church, where it reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n          À LA GLOIRE DE DIEU\r\n        DONT DE LES TEMPS ANCIENS\r\n  ET À TRAVERS LE MARTYR DE LEURS PÈRES\r\n              A MAINTENU\r\n            À DORMILHOUSE\r\n        LA FOI DONNE AUX SAINTS\r\n    ET LA CONNAISSANCE DE LA PAROLE\r\n        LES HABITANTS ONT ÉLEVÉ\r\n              CETTE PIERRE\r\n               MDCCCLXIV.\r\n\r\nHaving thus described the village and its history, a few words remain\r\nto be added as to the visit of our little party of travellers from\r\nPalons. On reaching the elevated point at which the archbishop had set\r\nup the red cross, the whole of the huts lay before us, and a little\r\nway down the mountain-side we discerned the village church,\r\ndistinguished by its little belfry. Leaving on our right the\r\nSwiss-looking châlet with overhanging roof, in which Neff used to\r\nlodge with the Baridon-Verdure family while at Dormilhouse, and now\r\nknown as \"Felix Neff's house,\" we made our way down a steep and stony\r\nfootpath towards the school-house adjoining the church, in front of\r\nwhich we found the large ash trees, shading both church and school,\r\nwhich Neff himself had planted. Arrived at the school-house, we there\r\nfound shelter and accommodation for the night. The schoolroom, fitted\r\nwith its forms and desks, was our parlour, and our bedrooms, furnished\r\nwith the blankets we had brought with us, were in the little chambers\r\nadjoining.\r\n\r\nAt eight in the evening the church bell rang for service--the\r\nsummoning bell. The people had been expecting the visit, and turned\r\nout in full force, so that at nine o'clock, when the last bell rang,\r\nthe church was found filled to the door. Every seat was occupied--by\r\nmen on one side, and by women on the other. The service was conducted\r\nby Mr. Milsom, the missionary visitor from Lyons, who opened with\r\nprayer, then gave out the twenty-third Psalm, which was sung to an\r\naccompaniment on the harmonium; then another prayer, followed by the\r\nreading of a chapter in the New Testament, was wound up by an address,\r\nin which the speaker urged the people to their continuance in\r\nwell-doing. In the course of his remarks he said: \"Be not discouraged\r\nbecause the results of your Labours may appear but small. Work on and\r\nfaint not, and God will give the spiritual increase. Pastors,\r\nteachers, and colporteurs are too often ready to despond, because the\r\nfruit does not seem to ripen while they are watching it. But the best\r\nfruit grows slowly. Think how the Apostles laboured. They were all\r\npoor men, but men of brave hearts; and they passed away to their rest\r\nlong before the seed which they planted grew up and ripened to\r\nperfection. Work on then in patience and hope, and be assured that God\r\nwill at length help you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Milsom's address was followed by another from the pastor, and then\r\nby a final prayer and hymn, after which the service was concluded, and\r\nthe villagers dispersed to their respective homes a little after ten\r\no'clock. The snow had ceased falling, but the sky was still overcast,\r\nand the night felt cold and raw, like February rather than July.\r\n\r\nThe wonder is, that this community of Dormilhouse should cling to\r\ntheir mountain eyrie so long after the necessity for their living\r\nabove the clouds has ceased; but it is their home, and they have come\r\nto love it, and are satisfied to live and die there. Rather than live\r\nelsewhere, they will walk, as some of them do, twelve miles in the\r\nearly morning, to their work down in the valley of the Durance, and\r\ntwelve miles home again, in the evenings, to their perch on the rocks\r\nat Dormilhouse.\r\n\r\nThey are even proud of their mountain home, and would not change it\r\nfor the most smiling vineyard of the plains. They are like a little\r\nmountain clan--all Baridons, or Michels, or Orcieres, or Bertholons,\r\nor Arnouds--proud of their descent from the ancient Vaudois. It is\r\ntheir boast that a Roman Catholic does not live among them. Once, when\r\na young shepherd came up from the valley to pasture his flock in the\r\nmountains, he fell in love with a maiden of the village, and proposed\r\nto marry her. \"Yes,\" was the answer, with this condition, that he\r\njoined the Vaudois Church. And he assented, married the girl, and\r\nsettled for life at Dormilhouse.[105]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 105: Since the date of our visit, we learn that a\r\n         sad accident--strikingly illustrative of the perils of\r\n         village life at Dormilhouse--has befallen this young\r\n         shepherd, by name Jean Joseph Lagier. One day in October,\r\n         1869, while engaged in gathering wood near the brink of the\r\n         precipice overhanging Minsals, he accidently fell over and\r\n         was killed on the spot, leaving behind him a widow and a\r\n         large family. He was a person of such excellent character and\r\n         conduct, that he had been selected as colporteur for the\r\n         neighbourhood.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning broke clear and bright overhead. The sun shone along\r\nthe rugged face of the Gramusac right over against the hamlet,\r\nbringing out its bolder prominences. Far below, the fleecy clouds were\r\nstill rolling themselves up the mountain-sides, or gradually\r\ndispersing as the sun caught them on their emerging from the valley\r\nbelow. The view was bold and striking, displaying the grandeur of the\r\nscenery of Dormilhouse in one of its best aspects.\r\n\r\nSetting out on the return journey to Palons, we descended the face of\r\nthe mountain on which Dormilhouse stands, by a steep footpath right in\r\nfront of it, down towards the falls of the Biasse. Looking back, the\r\nwhole village appeared above us, cottage over cottage, and ledge over\r\nledge, with its stern background of rocky mountain.\r\n\r\nImmediately under the village, in a hollow between two shoulders of\r\nrock, the cascade of the Biasse leaps down into the valley. The\r\nhighest leap falls in a jet of about a hundred feet, and the lower,\r\ndivided into two by a projecting ledge, breaks into a shower of spray\r\nwhich falls about a hundred and fifty feet more into the abyss below.\r\nEven in Switzerland this fall would be considered a fine object; but\r\nin this out-of-the-way place, it is rarely seen except by the\r\nvillagers, who have water and cascades more than enough.\r\n\r\nWe were told on the spot, that some eighty years since an avalanche\r\nshot down the mountain immediately on to the plateau on which we\r\nstood, carrying with it nearly half the village of Dormilhouse; and\r\nevery year the avalanches shoot down at the same place, which is\r\nstrewn with the boulders and débris that extend far down into the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the Tourniquet we joined M. Charpiot, accompanying\r\nthe donkey laden with the blankets and knapsacks, and proceeded with\r\nhim on our way down the valley towards his hospitable parsonage at\r\nPalons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nGUILLESTRE AND THE VALLEY OF QUEYRAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left Palons on a sharp, bright morning in July, with the prospect\r\nof a fine day before us, though there had been a fall of snow in the\r\nnight, which whitened the tops of the neighbouring hills. Following\r\nthe road along the heights on the right bank of the Biasse, and\r\npassing the hamlet of Chancellas, another favourite station of Neff's,\r\na rapid descent led us down into the valley of the Durance, which we\r\ncrossed a little above the village of St. Crepin, with the strong\r\nfortress of Mont Dauphin before us a few miles lower down the valley.\r\n\r\nThis remote corner in the mountains was the scene of much fighting in\r\nearly times between the Roman Catholics and the Huguenots, and\r\nafterwards between the French and the Piedmontese. It was in this\r\nneighbourhood that Lesdiguières first gave evidence of his skill and\r\nvalour as a soldier. The massacre of St. Bartholomew at Paris in 1572\r\nhad been followed by like massacres in various parts of France,\r\nespecially in the south. The Roman Catholics of Dauphiny, deeming the\r\nopportunity favourable for the extirpation of the heretical Vaudois,\r\ndispatched the military commandant of Embrun against the inhabitants\r\nof Val Fressinières at the head of an army of twelve hundred men.\r\nLesdiguières, then scarce twenty-four years old, being informed of\r\ntheir march, hastily assembled a Huguenot force in the valley of the\r\nDrac, and, crossing the Col d'Orcières from Champsaur into the valley\r\nof the Durance, he suddenly fell upon the enemy at St. Crepin, routed\r\nthem, and drove them down the valley to Embrun. Twelve years later,\r\nduring the wars of the League, Lesdiguières distinguished himself in\r\nthe same neighbourhood, capturing Embrun, Guillestre, and Château\r\nQueyras, in the valley of the Guil, thereby securing the entire\r\nprovince for his royal master, Henry of Navarre.\r\n\r\nThe strong fortress of Mont Dauphin, at the junction of the Guil with\r\nthe Durance, was not constructed until a century later. Victor-Amadeus\r\nII., when invading the province with a Piedmontese army, at sight of\r\nthe plateau commanding the entrance of both valleys, exclaimed, \"There\r\nis a pass to fortify.\" The hint was not neglected by the French\r\ngeneral, Catinat, under whose directions the great engineer, Vauban,\r\ntraced the plan of the present fortifications. It is a very strong\r\nplace, completely commanding the valley of the Durance, while it is\r\nregarded as the key of the passage into Italy by the Guil and the Col\r\nde la Croix.\r\n\r\nGuillestre is a small old-fashioned town, situated on the lowest slope\r\nof the pine-clad mountain, the Tête de Quigoulet, at the junction of\r\nthe Rioubel and the Chagne, rivulets in summer but torrents in winter,\r\nwhich join the Guil a little below the town. Guillestre was in ancient\r\ntimes a strong place, and had for its lords the Archbishops of Embrun,\r\nthe ancient persecutors of the Vaudois. The castle of the archbishop,\r\nflanked by six towers, occupied a commanding site immediately\r\noverlooking the town; but at the French Revolution of 1789, the first\r\nthing which the archbishop's flock did was to pull his castle in\r\npieces, leaving not one stone upon another; and, strange to say, the\r\nonly walled enclosure now within its precincts is the little\r\nburying-ground of the Guillestre Protestants. One memorable stone has,\r\nhowever, been preserved, the stone trough in which the peasants were\r\nrequired to measure the tribute of grain payable by them to their\r\nreverend seigneurs. It is still to be seen laid against a wall in an\r\nopen space in front of the church.\r\n\r\nIt happened that the fair of Guillestre, which is held every two\r\nmonths, was afoot at the time of our visit. It is frequented by the\r\npeople of the adjoining valleys, of which Guillestre is the centre, as\r\nwell as by Piedmontese from beyond the Italian frontier. On the\r\nprincipal day of the fair we found the streets filled with peasants\r\nbuying and selling beasts. They were apparently of many races. Amongst\r\nthem were many well-grown men, some with rings in their\r\nears--horse-dealers from Piedmont, we were told; but the greater\r\nnumber were little, dark, thin, and poorly-fed peasants. Some of them,\r\ndark-eyed and tawny-skinned, looked like Arabs, possibly descendants\r\nof the Saracens who once occupied the province. There were one or two\r\ngroups of gipsies, differing from all else; but the district is too\r\npoor to be much frequented by people of that race.\r\n\r\nThe animals brought for sale showed the limited resources of the\r\nneighbourhood. One hill-woman came along dragging two goats in milk;\r\nanother led a sheep and a goat; a third a donkey in foal; a fourth a\r\ncow in milk; and so on. The largest lot consisted of about forty\r\nlambs, of various sizes and breeds, which had been driven down from\r\nthe cool air of the mountains, and, gasping with heat, were cooling\r\ntheir heads against the shady side of a stone wall. There were several\r\nlots of pigs, of a bad but probably hardy sort--mostly black,\r\nround-backed, long-legged, and long-eared. In selling the animals,\r\nthere was the usual chaffering, in shrill patois, at the top of the\r\nvoice--the seller of some poor scraggy beast extolling its merits, the\r\nintending buyer running it down as a \"misérable bossu,\" &c., and\r\ndisputing every point raised in its behalf, until the contest of words\r\nrose to such a height--men, women, and even children, on both sides,\r\ntaking part in it--that the bystander would have thought it impossible\r\nthey could separate without a fight. But matters always came to a\r\npeaceable conclusion, for the French are by no means a quarrelsome\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThere were also various other sorts of produce offered for sale--wool,\r\nundressed sheepskins, sticks for firewood, onions and vegetable\r\nproduce, and considerable quantities of honeycomb; while the sellers\r\nof scythes, whetstones, caps, and articles of dress, seemed to meet\r\nwith a ready sale for their wares, arranged on stalls in the open\r\nspace in front of the church. Altogether, the queer collection of\r\nbeasts and their drivers, who were to be seen drinking together\r\ngreedily and promiscuously from the fountains in the market-place; the\r\nsteep streets, crowded with lean goats and cows and pigs, and their\r\nbuyers and sellers; the braying of donkeys and the shrieking of\r\nchafferers, with here and there a goitred dwarf of hideous aspect,\r\npresented a picture of an Alpine mountain fair, which, once seen, is\r\nnot readily forgotten.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar fair held at the village of La Bessie, before\r\nmentioned, a little higher up the Durance, on the road to Briançon;\r\nbut it is held only once a year, at the end of October, when the\r\ninhabitants of Dormilhouse come down in a body to lay in their stock\r\nof necessaries for the winter. \"There then arrives,\" says M. Albert,\r\n\"a caravan of about the most singular character that can be imagined.\r\nIt consists of nearly the whole population of the mountain hamlet, who\r\nresort thither to supply themselves with the articles required for\r\nfamily use during the winter, such as leather, lint, salt, and oil.\r\nThese poor mountaineers are provided with very little money, and, to\r\nprocure the necessary commodities, they have recourse to barter, the\r\nmost ancient and primitive method of conducting trade. Hence they\r\nbring with them rye, barley, pigs, lambs, chamois skins and horns, and\r\nthe produce of their knitting during the past year, to exchange for\r\nthe required articles, with which they set out homeward, laden as they\r\nhad come.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe same circumstances which have concurred in making Guillestre the\r\nseat of the principal fair of the valleys, led Felix Neff to regard it\r\nas an important centre of missionary operations amongst the Vaudois.\r\nIn nearly all the mountain villages in its neighbourhood descendants\r\nof the ancient Vaudois are to be found, sometimes in the most remote\r\nand inaccessible places, whither they had fled in the times of the\r\npersecutions. Thus at Vars, a mountain hamlet up the torrent Rioubel,\r\nabout nine miles from Guillestre, there is a little Christian\r\ncommunity, which, though under the necessity of long concealing their\r\nfaith, never ceased to be Vaudois in spirit.[106] Then, up the valley\r\nof the Guil, and in the lateral valleys which join it, there are, in\r\nsome places close to the mountain barrier which divides France from\r\nItaly, other villages and hamlets, such as Arvieux, San Veran,\r\nFongilarde, &c., the inhabitants of which, though they concealed their\r\nfaith subsequent to the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, never\r\nconformed to Roman Catholicism, but took the earliest opportunity of\r\ndeclaring themselves openly so soon as the dark period of persecution\r\nhad passed by.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 106: The well-known Alpine missionary, J. L.\r\n         Rostan, of whom an interesting biography has recently been\r\n         published by the Rev. A. J. French, for the Wesleyan\r\n         Conference, was a native of Vars. He was one of the favourite\r\n         pupils of Felix Neff, with whom he resided at Dormilhouse in\r\n         1825-7; Neff saying of him: \"Among the best of my pupils, as\r\n         regards spiritual things and secular too, is Jean Rostan, of\r\n         Vars: he is probably destined for the ministry; such at least\r\n         is my hope.\" Neff bequeathed to him the charge of his parish\r\n         during his temporary absence, but he never returned; and\r\n         shortly after, Rostan left, to pursue his studies at\r\n         Montauban. He joined the Methodist Church, settled and\r\n         ministered for a time in La Vaunage and the Cevennes,\r\n         afterwards labouring as a missionary in the High Alps, and\r\n         eventually settled as minister of the church at Lisieux,\r\n         Jersey, in charge of which he died, July, 1859.]\r\n\r\nThe people of these scattered and distant hamlets were, however, too\r\npoor to supply themselves with religious instructors, and they long\r\nremained in a state of spiritual destitution. Felix Neff's labours\r\nwere too short, and scattered over too extensive a field, to produce\r\nmuch permanent effect. Besides, they were principally confined to the\r\nvillage of Dormilhouse, which, as being the most destitute, had, he\r\nthought, the greatest claim upon his help; and at his death\r\ncomparatively little had been done or attempted in the Guillestre\r\ndistrict. But he left behind him what was worth more than any\r\nendowment of money, a noble example, which still lives, and inspires\r\nthe labourers who have come after him.\r\n\r\nIt was not until within the last twenty years that a few Vaudois\r\nfamilies of Guillestre began to meet together for religious purposes,\r\nwhich they did at first in the upper chamber of an inn. There the Rev.\r\nMr. Freemantle found them when paying his first visit to the valleys\r\nin 1851. He was rejoiced to see the zeal of the people, holding to\r\ntheir faith in the face of considerable opposition and opprobrium; and\r\nhe exerted himself to raise the requisite funds amongst his friends in\r\nEngland to provide the Guillestre Vaudois with a place of worship of\r\ntheir own. His efforts were attended with success; and in 1854 a\r\ncomfortable parsonage, with a commodious room for public worship, was\r\npurchased for their use. A fund was also provided for the maintenance\r\nof a settled ministry; a pastor was appointed; and in 1857 a\r\ncongregation of from forty to seventy persons attended worship every\r\nSunday. Mr. Freemantle, in a communication with which he has favoured\r\nus, says: \"Our object has not been to make an aggression upon the\r\nRoman Catholics, but to strengthen the hands and establish the faith\r\nof the Vaudois. And in so doing we have found, not unfrequently, that\r\nwhen an interest has been excited among the Roman Catholic population\r\nof the district, there has been some family or hereditary connection\r\nwith ancestors who were independent of the see of Rome, and such have\r\nagain joined themselves to the faith of their fathers.\"\r\n\r\nThe new movement was not, however, allowed to proceed without great\r\nopposition. The \"Momiers,\" or mummers--the modern nickname of the\r\nVaudois--were denounced by the curé of the place, and the people were\r\ncautioned, as they valued their souls' safety, against giving any\r\ncountenance to their proceedings. The curé was doubtless seriously\r\nimpressed by the gravity of the situation; and to protect the parish\r\nagainst the assaults of the evil one, he had a large number of crosses\r\nerected upon the heights overlooking the town. On one occasion he had\r\na bad dream, in which he beheld the valley filled with a vast assembly\r\ncome to be judged; and on the site of the judgment-seat which he saw\r\nin his dream, he set up, on the summit of the Come Chauve, a large tin\r\ncross hearted with wood. We were standing in the garden in front of\r\nthe parsonage at Guillestre late in the evening, when M. Schell, the\r\npastor, pointing up to the height, said, \"There you see it now; that\r\nis the curé's erection.\" The valley below lay in deep shadow, while\r\nthe cross upon the summit brightly reflected the last rays of the\r\nsetting sun.\r\n\r\nThe curé, finding that the \"Momiers\" did not cease to exist, next\r\nadopted the expedient of preaching them down. On the occasion of the\r\nFête Napoleon, 1862, when the Rev. Mr. Freemantle visited Guillestre\r\nfor the purpose of being present at the Vaudois services on Sunday,\r\nthe 10th of August, the curé preached a special sermon to his\r\ncongregation at early morning mass, telling them that an Englishman\r\nhad come into the town with millions of francs to buy up the souls of\r\nGuillestre, and warning them to abstain from such men.\r\n\r\nThe people were immediately filled with curiosity to know what it was\r\nthat this stranger had come all the way from England to do, backed by\r\n\"millions of francs.\" Many of them did not as yet know that there was\r\nsuch a thing as a Vaudois church in Guillestre; but now that they did\r\nknow, they were desirous of ascertaining something about the doctrines\r\ntaught there. The consequence was, that a crowd of people--amongst\r\nwhom were some of the highest authorities in the town, the registrar,\r\nthe douaniers, the chief of a neighbouring commune, and persons of all\r\nclasses--assembled at noon to hear M. de Faye, the Protestant pastor,\r\nwho preached to them an excellent sermon under the trees of the\r\nparsonage orchard, while a still larger number attended in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nWhen the curé heard of the conduct of his flock he was greatly\r\nannoyed. \"What did you hear from the heretics?\" he asked of one of the\r\ndelinquents. \"I heard _your_ sermon in the morning, and a sermon _upon\r\ncharity_ in the afternoon,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nGreat were the surprise and excitement in Guillestre when it became\r\nknown that the principal sergeant of gendarmerie--the very embodiment\r\nof law and order in the place--had gone over and joined the \"Momiers\"\r\nwith his wife and family. M. Laugier was quite a model gendarme. He\r\nwas a man of excellent character, steady, sensible, and patient, a\r\ndiligent self-improver, a reader of books, a botanist, and a bit of a\r\ngeologist. He knew all the rare mountain plants, and had a collection\r\nof those that would bear transplantation, in his garden at the back of\r\nthe town. No man was more respected in Guillestre than the sergeant.\r\nHis long and faithful service entitled him to the _médaille\r\nmilitaire_, and it would have been awarded to him, but for the\r\ncircumstance which came to light, and which he did not seek to\r\nconceal, that he had joined the Protestant connexion. Not only was the\r\nmedal withheld, but influence was used to get him sent away from the\r\nplace; and he was packed off to a station in the mountains at Château\r\nQueyras.\r\n\r\nThough this banishment from Guillestre was intended as a punishment,\r\nit only served to bring out the sterling qualities of the sergeant,\r\nand to ensure his eventual reward. It so happened that the station at\r\nChâteau Queyras commanded the approaches into an extensive range of\r\nmountain pasturage. Although not required specially to attend to their\r\nsafety, our sergeant had nevertheless carefully noted the flocks and\r\nherds as they went up the valleys in the spring. When winter\r\napproached, they were all brought down again from the mountains for\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nThe winter of that year set in early and severely. The sergeant,\r\nmaking his observations on the flocks as they passed down the valley,\r\nnoted that one large flock of about three thousand sheep had not yet\r\nmade its appearance. The mountains were now covered with snow, and he\r\napprehended that the sheep and their shepherds had been storm-stayed.\r\nSummoning to his assistance a body of men, he set out at their head in\r\nsearch of the lost flock. After a long, laborious, and dangerous\r\njourney--for the snow by this time lay deep in the hollows of the\r\nhills--he succeeded in discovering the shepherds and the sheep, almost\r\nreduced to their last gasp--the sheep, for want of food, actually\r\ngnawing each other's tails. With great difficulty the whole were\r\nextricated from their perilous position, and brought down the\r\nmountains in safety.\r\n\r\nNo representation was made to head-quarters by the authorities of\r\nGuillestre of the conduct of the Protestant sergeant in the matter;\r\nbut when the shepherds got down to Gap, they were so full of the\r\nsergeant's praises, and of his bravery in rescuing them and their\r\nflock from certain death, that a paragraph descriptive of the affair\r\nwas inserted in the local papers, and was eventually copied into the\r\nParisian journals. Then it was that an inquiry was made into his\r\nconduct, and the result was so satisfactory that the sergeant was at\r\nonce decorated not only with the _médaille militaire_, but with the\r\n_médaille de sauvetage_--a still higher honour; and, shortly after, he\r\nwas allowed to retire from the service on full pay. He then returned\r\nto his home and family at Guillestre, where he now officiates as\r\n_Regent_ of the Vaudois church, reading the prayers and conducting the\r\nservice in the absence of the stated minister.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe spent a Sunday in the comfortable parsonage at Guillestre. There\r\nwas divine service in the temple at half-past ten A.M., conducted by\r\nthe regular pastor, M. Schell, and instruction and catechizing of the\r\nchildren in the afternoon. The pastor's regular work consists of two\r\nservices at Guillestre and Vars on alternate Sundays, with\r\nSunday-school and singing lesson; and on week days he gives religious\r\ninstruction in the Guillestre school. The missionary's wife is a true\r\n\"helpmeet,\" and having been trained as a deaconess at Strasbourg, she\r\nregularly visits the poor, occasionally assisting them with medical\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nAnother important part of the work at Guillestre is the girls' school,\r\nfor which suitable premises have been taken; and it is conducted by an\r\nexcellent female teacher. Here not only the usual branches of\r\neducation are taught, but domestic industry of different kinds.\r\nThrough the instrumentality of Mr. Milsom, glove-sewing has been\r\ntaught to the girls, and it is hoped that by this and similar efforts\r\nthis branch of home manufacture may become introduced in the High\r\nAlps, and furnish profitable employment to many poor persons during\r\ntheir long and dreary winter.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of a special fund, a few girl boarders, belonging to\r\nscattered Protestant families who have no other means for the\r\neducation of their children, are also received at the school. The\r\ngirls seem to be extremely well taken care of, and the house, which we\r\nwent over, is a very pattern of cleanliness and comfort.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe route from Guillestre into Italy lies up the valley of the Guil,\r\nthrough one of the wildest and deepest gorges, or rather chasms, to be\r\nfound in Europe. Brockedon says it is \"one of the finest in the Alps.\"\r\nM. Bost compares it to the Moutier-Grand-Val, in the canton of Berne,\r\nbut says it is much wilder. He even calls it frightful, which it is\r\nnot, except in rainy weather, when the rocks occasionally fall from\r\noverhead. At such times people avoid travelling through the gorge. M.\r\nBost also likens it to the Via Mala, though here the road, at the\r\nnarrowest and most precipitous parts, runs in the _bottom_ of the\r\ngorge, in a ledge cut in the rock, there being room only for the river\r\nand the road. It is only of late years that the road has been\r\ncompleted, and it is often partly washed away in winter, or covered\r\nwith rock and stones brought down by the torrent. When Neff travelled\r\nthe gorge, it was passable only on foot, or on mule-back. Yet\r\nlight-footed armies have passed into Italy by this route. Lesdiguières\r\nclambered over the mountains and along the Guil to reach Château\r\nQueyras, which he assaulted and took. Louis XIII. once accompanied a\r\nFrench army about a league up the gorge, but he turned back, afraid to\r\ngo farther; and the hamlet at which his progress was arrested is still\r\ncalled Maison du Roi. About three leagues higher up, after crossing\r\nthe Guil from bank to bank several times, in order to make use of such\r\nledges of the rock as are suitable for the road, the gorge opens into\r\nthe Combe du Queyras, and very shortly the picturesque-looking Castle\r\nof Queyras comes in sight, occupying the summit of a lofty conical\r\nrock in the middle of the valley.\r\n\r\nAs we approached Château Queyras the ruins of a building were pointed\r\nout by Mr. Milsom in the bottom of the valley, close by the\r\nriver-side. \"That,\" said he, \"was once the Protestant temple of the\r\nplace. It was burnt to the ground at the Revocation. You see that old\r\nelm-tree growing near it. That tree was at the same time burnt to a\r\nblack stump. It became a saying in the valley that Protestantism was\r\nas dead as that stump, and that it would only reappear when that dead\r\nstump came to life! And, strange to say, since Felix Neff has been\r\nhere, the stump _has_ come to life--you see how green it is--and again\r\nProtestantism is like the elm-tree, sending out its vigorous\r\noffshoots, in the valley.\"\r\n\r\nChâteau Queyras stands in the centre of the valley of the Guil, which\r\nis joined near this point by two other valleys, the Combe of Arvieux\r\njoining it on the right bank, and that of San Veran on the left. The\r\nheads of the streams which traverse these valleys have their origin in\r\nthe snowy range of the Cottian Alps, which form the boundary between\r\nFrance and Italy. As in the case of the descendants of the ancient\r\nVaudois at Dormilhouse, they are here also found at the farthest limit\r\nof vegetation, penetrating almost to the edge of the glacier, where\r\nthey were least likely to be molested. The inhabitants of Arvieux were\r\nformerly almost entirely Protestant, and had a temple there, which was\r\npulled down at the Revocation. From that time down to the Revolution\r\nthey worshipped only in secret, occasionally ministered to by Vaudois\r\npastors, who made precarious visits to them from the Italian valleys\r\nat the risk of their lives.\r\n\r\nAbove Arvieux is the hamlet of La Chalp, containing a considerable\r\nnumber of Protestants, and where Neff had his home--a small, low\r\ncottage undistinguishable from the others save by its whitewashed\r\nfront. Its situation is cheerful, facing the south, and commanding a\r\npleasant mountain prospect, contrasting strongly with the barren\r\noutlook and dismal hovels of Dormilhouse. But Neff never could regard\r\nthe place as his home. \"The inhabitants,\" he observed in his journal,\r\n\"have more traffic, and the mildness of the climate appears somehow or\r\nother not favourable to the growth of piety. They are zealous\r\nProtestants, and show me a thousand attentions, but they are at\r\npresent absolutely impenetrable.\" The members of the congregation at\r\nArvieux, indeed, complained of his spending so little of his time\r\namong them; but the comfort of his cottage at La Chalp, and the\r\ncomparative mildness of the climate of Arvieux, were insufficient to\r\nattract him from the barren crags but warm hearts of Dormilhouse.\r\n\r\nThe village of San Veran, which lies up among the mountains some\r\ntwelve miles to the east of Arvieux, on the opposite side of the Val\r\nQueyras, was another of the refuges of the ancient Vaudois. It is at\r\nthe foot of the snowy ridge which divides France from Italy. Dr. Gilly\r\nsays, \"There is nothing fit for mortal to take refuge in between San\r\nVeran and the eternal snows which mantle the pinnacles of Monte Viso.\"\r\nThe village is 6,692 feet above the level of the sea, and there is a\r\nprovincial saying that San Veran is the highest spot in Europe where\r\nbread is eaten. Felix Neff said, \"It is the highest, and consequently\r\nthe most pious, in the valley of Queyras.\" Dr. Gilly was the second\r\nEnglishman who had ever found his way to the place, and he was\r\naccompanied on the occasion by Mrs. Gilly. \"The sight of a female,\"\r\nhe says, \"dressed entirely in linen, was a phenomenon so new to those\r\nsimple peasants, whose garments are never anything but woollen, that\r\nPizarro and his mail-clad companions were not greater objects of\r\ncuriosity to the Peruvians than we were to these mountaineers.\"\r\n\r\nNot far distant from San Veran are the mountain hamlets of Pierre\r\nGrosse and Fongillarde, also ancient retreats of the persecuted\r\nVaudois, and now for the most part inhabited by Protestants. The\r\nremoteness and comparative inaccessibility of these mountain hamlets\r\nmay be inferred from the fact that in 1786, when the Protestants of\r\nFrance were for the first time since the Revocation of the Edict of\r\nNantes permitted to worship in public without molestation, four years\r\nelapsed before the intelligence reached San Veran.\r\n\r\nWe have now reached almost the extreme limits of France; Italy lying\r\non the other side of the snowy peaks which shut in the upper valleys\r\nof the Alps. In Neff's time the parish of which he had charge extended\r\nfrom San Veran, on the frontier, to Champsaur, in the valley of the\r\nDrac, a distance of nearly eighty miles. His charge consisted of the\r\nscattered population of many mountain hamlets, to visit which in\r\nsuccession involved his travelling a total distance of not less than\r\none hundred and eighty miles. It was, of course, impossible that any\r\nsingle man, no matter how inspired by zeal and devotion, could do\r\njustice to a charge so extensive. The difficulties of passing through\r\na country so wild and rugged were also very great, especially in\r\nwinter. Neff records that on one occasion he took six hours to make\r\nthe journey, in the midst of a snow-storm which completely hid the\r\nfootpath, from his cottage at La Chalp to San Veran, a distance of\r\nonly twelve miles.\r\n\r\nThe pastors who succeeded Neff had the same difficulties to encounter,\r\nand there were few to be found who could brave them. The want of proper\r\ndomestic accommodation for the pastors was also felt to be a great\r\nhindrance. Accordingly, one of the first things to which the Rev. Mr.\r\nFreemantle directed his attention, when he entered upon his noble work\r\nof supplying the spiritual destitution of the French Vaudois, was to\r\ntake steps not only to supply the poor people with more commodious\r\ntemples, but also to provide dwelling-houses for the pastors. And in the\r\ncourse of a few years, helped by friends in England, he has been enabled\r\nreally to accomplish a very great deal. The extensive parish of Neff is\r\nnow divided into five sub-parishes--that of Fressinières, which includes\r\nPalons, Violins, and Dormilhouse, provided with three temples, a\r\nparsonage, and schools; Arvieux, with the hamlets of Brunissard (where\r\nworship was formerly conducted in a stable) and La Chalp, provided with\r\ntwo temples, a parsonage, and schools; San Veran, with Fongillarde and\r\nPierre Grosse, provided with three temples, a parsonage, and a school;\r\nSt. Laurent du Cros and Champsaur, in the valley of the Drac, provided\r\nwith a temple, school, &c., principally through the liberality of Lord\r\nMonson; and Guillestre and Vars, provided with two temples, a parsonage,\r\nand a girls' school. A temple, with a residence for a pastor, has also\r\nof late years been provided at Briançon, with a meeting-place also at\r\nthe village of Villeneuve.\r\n\r\nSuch are the agencies now at work in the district of the High Alps,\r\nhelped on by a few zealous workers in England and abroad. While the\r\nobject of the pastors, in the words of Mr. Freemantle, is \"not to\r\nregard themselves as missionaries to proselytize Roman Catholics, but\r\nas ministers residing among their own people, whose faith, and love,\r\nand holiness they have to promote,\" they also endeavour to institute\r\nmeasures with the object of improving the social and domestic\r\ncondition of the Vaudois. Thus, in one district--that of St. Laurent\r\ndu Cros--a _banque de prévoyance_, or savings-bank, has been\r\nestablished; and though it was at first regarded with suspicion, it\r\nhas gradually made its way and proved of great value, being made use\r\nof by the indigent Roman Catholics as well as Protestant families of\r\nthe district. Such efforts and such agencies as these cannot fail to\r\nbe followed by blessings, and to be greatly instrumental for good.\r\n\r\nOur last night in France was spent in the miserable little town of\r\nAbries, situated immediately at the foot of the Alpine ridge which\r\nseparates France from Italy. On reaching the principal hotel, or\r\nrather auberge, we found every bed taken; but a peep into the dark and\r\ndirty kitchen, which forms the entrance-hall of the place, made us\r\nalmost glad that there was no room for us in that inn. We turned out\r\ninto the wet streets to find a better; but though we succeeded in\r\nfinding beds in a poor house in a back lane, little can be said in\r\ntheir praise. We were, however, supplied with a tolerable dinner, and\r\ncontrived to pass the night in rest, and to start refreshed early on\r\nthe following morning on our way to the Vaudois valleys of Piedmont.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Valley of Luserne.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY OF THE PELICE--LA TOUR--ANGROGNA--THE PRA DU TOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe village of Abries is situated close to the Alpine ridge, the\r\nsummit of which marks the boundary between France and Italy. On the\r\nother side lie the valleys of Piedmont, in which the French Vaudois\r\nwere accustomed to take refuge when persecution ravaged their own\r\nvalleys, passing by the mountain-road we were now about to travel, as\r\nfar as La Tour, in the valley of the Pelice.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are occasional villages along the route, there is no\r\ngood resting-place for travellers short of La Tour, some twenty-six\r\nmiles distant from Abries; and as it was necessary that we should walk\r\nthe distance, the greater part of the road being merely a track,\r\nscarcely practicable for mules, we were up betimes in the morning, and\r\non our way. The sun had scarcely risen above the horizon. The mist\r\nwas still hanging along the mountain-sides, and the stillness of the\r\nscene was only broken by the murmur of the Guil running in its rocky\r\nbed below. Passing through the hamlet of Monta, where the French\r\ndouane has its last frontier station, we began the ascent; and soon,\r\nas the sun rose and the mists cleared away, we saw the profile of the\r\nmountain up which we were climbing cast boldly upon the range behind\r\nus on the further side of the valley. A little beyond the ravine of\r\nthe Combe de la Croix, along the summit of which the road winds, we\r\nreached the last house within the French frontier--a hospice, not very\r\ninviting in appearance, for the accommodation of travellers. A little\r\nfurther is the Col, and passing a stone block carved with the\r\nfleur-de-lis and cross of Savoy, we crossed the frontier of France and\r\nentered Italy.\r\n\r\nOn turning a shoulder of the mountain, we looked down upon the head of\r\nthe valley of the Pelice, a grand and savage scene. The majestic,\r\nsnow-capped Monte Viso towers up on the right, at the head of the\r\nvalley, amidst an assemblage of other great mountain masses. From its\r\nfoot seems to steal the river Pelice, now a quiet rivulet, though in\r\nwinter a raging torrent. Right in front, lower down the valley, is the\r\nrocky defile of Mirabouc, a singularly savage gorge, seemingly rent\r\nasunder by some tremendous convulsion of nature; beyond and over which\r\nextends the valley of the Pelice, expanding into that of the Po, and\r\nin the remote distance the plains of Piedmont; while immediately\r\nbeneath our feet, as it were, but far below, lies a considerable\r\nbreadth of green pasture, the Bergerie of Pra, enclosed on all sides\r\nby the mountains over which we look.\r\n\r\nThe descent from the Col down into the Pra is very difficult, in some\r\nplaces almost precipitous--far more abrupt than on the French side,\r\nwhere the incline up to the summit is comparatively easy.\r\n\r\nThe zigzag descends from one rock to another, along the face of a\r\nshelving slope, by a succession of notches (from which the footpath is\r\nnot inappropriately termed _La Coche_) affording a very insecure\r\nfooting for the few mules which occasionally cross the pass. Dr. Gilly\r\ncrossed here from La Tour with Mrs. Gilly in 1829, when about to visit\r\nthe French valleys; but he found the path so difficult and dangerous,\r\nthat the lady had to walk nearly the whole way.\r\n\r\nAs we descended the mountain almost by a succession of leaps, we\r\novertook M. Gariod, deputy judge of Gap, engaged in botanizing among\r\nthe rocks; and he informed us that among the rarer specimens he had\r\ncollected in the course of his journey on the summit were the\r\n_Polygonum alpinum_ and _Silene vallesia_, above Monta; the\r\n_Leucanthemum alpinum_, near the Hospice; the _Linaria alpina_ and\r\n_Cirsium spinosissimus_ on the Col; while the _Lloydia serotina_,\r\n_Arabis alpina_, _Phyteuma hemisphericum_, and _Rhododendrum\r\nferrugineum_, were found all over the face of the rocky descent to the\r\nPra.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the _Coche_ we arrived at the first house in Italy, the\r\nlittle auberge of the Pra, a great resort of sportsmen, who come to\r\nhunt the chamois in the adjoining mountains during the season. Here is\r\nalso the usual customs station, with a few officers of the Italian\r\ndouane, to watch the passage of merchandise across the frontier.\r\n\r\nThe road from hence to la Tour is along the river Pelice, which is\r\nkept in sight nearly the whole way. A little below the Pra, where it\r\nenters the defile of Mirabouc, the path merely follows what is the\r\nbed of the torrent in winter. The descent is down ledges and notches,\r\nfrom rock to rock, with rugged precipices overhanging the ravine for\r\nnearly a mile. At its narrowest part stand the ruins of the ancient\r\nfort of Mirabouc, built against the steep escarpments of the mountain,\r\nwhich, in ancient times, completely commanded and closed the defile\r\nagainst the passage of an enemy from that quarter. And difficult\r\nthough the Col de la Croix is for the passage of an army, it has on\r\nmore than one occasion been passed by French detachments in their\r\ninvasion of Italy.\r\n\r\nIt is not until we reach Bobi, or Bobbio, several miles lower down the\r\nPelice, that we at last feel we are in Italy. Here the valley opens\r\nout, the scenery is soft and inviting, the fields are well tilled, the\r\nvegetation is rich, and the clusters of chestnut-trees in magnificent\r\nfoliage. We now begin to see the striking difference between the\r\nFrench and the Italian valleys. The former are precipitous and\r\nsterile, constant falls of slaty rock blocking up the defiles; while\r\nhere the mountains lay aside their savage aspects, and are softened\r\ndown into picturesquely wooded hills, green pastures, and fertile\r\nfields stretching along the river-sides, yielding a rich territory for\r\nthe plough.\r\n\r\nYet, beautiful and peaceful though this valley of the Pelice now\r\nappears, there is scarcely a spot in it but has been consecrated by\r\nthe blood of martyrs to the cause of liberty and religion. In the\r\nrugged defile of the Mirabouc, which we have just passed, is the site\r\nof a battle fought between the Piedmontese troops and the Vaudois\r\npeasants, at a place called the Pian-del-Mort, where the persecuted,\r\nturning upon the persecutors, drove them back, and made good their\r\nretreat to their mountain fastnesses. Bobi itself was the scene of\r\nmany deadly struggles. A little above the village, on a rocky plateau,\r\nare the remains of an ancient fort, near the hamlet of Sibaud, where\r\nthe Vaudois performed one of their bravest exploits under Henri\r\nArnaud, after their \"Glorious Return\" from exile,--near which, on a\r\nstone still pointed out, they swore fidelity to each other, and that\r\nthey would die to the last man rather than abandon their country and\r\ntheir religion.\r\n\r\nNear Bobi is still to be seen a remarkable illustration of English\r\ninterest long ago felt in the people of these valleys. This is the\r\nlong embankment or breakwater, built by a grant from Oliver Cromwell,\r\nfor the purpose of protecting the village against the inundations of\r\nthe Pelice, by one of which it was nearly destroyed in the time of the\r\nProtectorate. It seems strange indeed that England should then have\r\nstretched out its hand so far, to help a people so poor and\r\nuninfluential as the Vaudois; but their sufferings had excited the\r\nsympathies of all Europe, and of Protestant England in particular,\r\nwhich not only sent them sympathy, but substantial succour. Cromwell\r\nalso, through the influence of Cardinal Mazarin, compelled the Duke of\r\nSavoy to suspend for a time the persecution of his subjects,--though\r\nshortly after the Protector's death it waxed hotter than ever.\r\n\r\nAll down the valley of the Pelice, we come upon village after\r\nvillage--La Piante, Villar, and Cabriol--which have been the scenes\r\nsometimes of heroic combats, and sometimes of treacherous massacres.\r\nYet all the cruelty of Grand Dukes and Popes during centuries did not\r\navail in turning the people of the valley from their faith. For they\r\ncontinue to worship after the same primitive forms as they did a\r\nthousand years ago; and in the principal villages and hamlets, though\r\nRomanism has long been supported by the power of the State and the\r\npatronage of the Church, the Protestant Vaudois continue to constitute\r\nthe majority of the population.\r\n\r\nRising up on the left of the road, between Villar and La Tour, are\r\nseen the bold and almost perpendicular rocks of Castelluzzo,\r\nterminating in the tower-like summit which has given to them their\r\nname. On the face of these rocks is one of the caverns in which the\r\nVaudois were accustomed to hide their women and children when they\r\nthemselves were forced to take the field. When Dr. Gilly first\r\nendeavoured to discover this famous cavern in 1829, he could not find\r\nany one who could guide him to it. Tradition said it was half way down\r\nthe perpendicular face of the rock, and it was known to be very\r\ndifficult to reach; but the doctor could not find any traces of it.\r\nDetermined, however, not to be baffled, he made a second attempt a\r\nmonth later, and succeeded. He had to descend some fifty feet from the\r\ntop of the cliff by a rope ladder, until a platform of rock was\r\nreached, from which the cavern was entered. It was found to consist of\r\nan irregular, rugged, sloping gallery in the face of the rock, of\r\nconsiderable extent, roofed in by a projecting crag. It is quite open\r\nto the south, but on all other sides it is secure; and it can only be\r\nentered from above. Such were the places to which the people of the\r\nvalleys were driven for shelter in the dark days so happily passed\r\naway.\r\n\r\nOne of the best indications of the improved _régime_ that now\r\nprevails, shortly presented itself in the handsome Vaudois church,\r\nsituated at the western entrance of the town of La Tour, near to which\r\nis the college for the education of Vaudois pastors, together with\r\nresidences for the clergy and professors. The founding of this\r\nestablishment, as well as of the hospital for the poor and infirm\r\nVaudois, is in a great measure due to the energetic zeal of the Dr.\r\nGilly so often quoted above, whose writings on behalf of the faithful\r\nbut destitute Protestants of the Piedmontese valleys, about forty\r\nyears since, awakened an interest in their behalf in England, as well\r\nas in foreign countries, which has not yet subsided.\r\n\r\nMore enthusiastic, if possible, even than Dr. Gilly, was the late\r\nGeneral Beckwith, who followed up, with extraordinary energy, the work\r\nwhich the other had so well begun. The general was an old Peninsular\r\nveteran, who had followed the late Duke of Wellington through most of\r\nhis campaigns, and lost a leg while serving under him at the battle of\r\nWaterloo. Hence the designation of him by a Roman Catholic bishop in\r\nan article published by him in one of the Italian journals, as \"the\r\nadventurer with the wooden leg.\"\r\n\r\nThe general's attention was first attracted to the subject of the\r\nVaudois in the following curiously accidental way. Being a regular\r\nvisitor at Apsley House, he called on the Duke one morning, and,\r\nfinding him engaged, he strolled into the library to spend an idle\r\nhalf-hour among the books. The first he took up was Dr. Gilly's\r\n\"Narrative,\" and what he read excited so lively an interest in his\r\nmind that he went direct to his bookseller and ordered all the\r\npublications relative to the Vaudois Church that could be procured.\r\n\r\nThe general's zeal being thus fired, he set out shortly after on a\r\nvisit to the Piedmontese valleys. He returned to them again and again,\r\nand at length settled at La Tour, where he devoted the remainder of\r\nhis life and a large portion of his fortune to the service of the\r\nVaudois Church and people. He organized a movement for the erection\r\nof schools, of which not fewer than one hundred and twenty were\r\nprovided mainly through his instrumentality in different parts of the\r\nvalleys, besides restoring and enlarging the college at La Tour,\r\nerecting the present commodious dwellings for the professors,\r\nproviding a superior school for the education of pastors' daughters,\r\nand contributing towards the erection of churches wherever churches\r\nwere needed.\r\n\r\nThe general was so zealous a missionary, so eager for the propagation\r\nof the Gospel, that some of his friends asked him why he did not\r\npreach to the people. \"No,\" said he; \"men have their special gifts,\r\nand mine is _a brick-and-mortar gift_.\" The general was satisfied to\r\ngo on as he had begun, helping to build schools, colleges, and\r\nchurches for the Vaudois, wherever most needed. His crowning work was\r\nthe erection of the grand block of buildings on the Viale del Ré at\r\nTurin, which not only includes a handsome and commodious Vaudois\r\nchurch, but an English church, and a Vaudois hospital and schools,\r\nerected at a cost of about fourteen thousand pounds, principally at\r\nthe cost of the general himself, generously aided by Mr. Brewin and\r\nother English contributors.\r\n\r\nNor were the people ungrateful to their benefactor. \"Let the name of\r\nGeneral Beckwith be blessed by all who pass this way,\" says an\r\ninscription placed upon one of the many schools opened through his\r\nefforts and generosity; and the whole country responds to the\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\nTo return to La Tour. The style of the buildings at its western\r\nend--the church, college, residences, and adjoining cottages, with\r\ntheir pretty gardens in front, designed, as they have been, by English\r\narchitects--give one the idea of the best part of an English town.\r\nBut this disappears as you enter the town itself, and proceed through\r\nthe principal street, which is long, narrow, and thoroughly Italian.\r\nThe situation of the town is exceedingly fine, at the foot of the\r\nVandalin Mountain, near the confluence of the river Angrogna with the\r\nPelice. The surrounding scenery is charming; and from the high\r\ngrounds, north and south of the town, extensive views may be had in\r\nall directions--especially up the valley of the Pelice, and eastward\r\nover the plains of Piedmont--the whole country being, as it were,\r\nembroidered with vineyards, corn-fields, and meadows, here and there\r\nshaded with groves and thickets, spread over a surface varied by\r\nhills, and knolls, and undulating slopes.\r\n\r\nThe size, importance, industry, and central situation of La Tour have\r\nalways caused it to be regarded as the capital of the valleys.\r\nOne-half of the Vaudois population occupies the valley of the Pelice\r\nand the lateral valley of Angrogna; the remainder, more widely\r\nscattered, occupying the valleys of Pérouse and Pragela, and the\r\nlateral valley of St. Martin--the entire number of the Protestant\r\npopulation in the several valleys amounting to about twenty thousand.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as we have already said, there is scarcely a hamlet in the\r\nvalleys but has been made famous by the resistance of its inhabitants\r\nin past times to the combined tyranny of the Popes of Rome and the\r\nDukes of Savoy, perhaps the most interesting events of all have\r\noccurred in the neighbourhood of La Tour, but more especially in the\r\nvalley of Angrogna, at whose entrance it stands.\r\n\r\nThe wonder is, that a scattered community of half-armed peasantry,\r\nwithout resources, without magazines, without fortresses, should have\r\nbeen able for any length of time to resist large bodies of regular\r\ntroops--Italian, French, Spanish, and even Irish!--led by the most\r\nexperienced commanders of the day, and abundantly supplied with arms,\r\ncannon, ammunition, and stores of all kinds. All that the people had\r\non their side--and it compensated for much--was a good cause, great\r\nbravery, and a perfect knowledge of the country in which, and for\r\nwhich, they fought.\r\n\r\nThough the Vaudois had no walled towns, their district was a natural\r\nfortress, every foot of which was known to them--every pass, every\r\ndefile, every barricade, and every defensible position. Resistance in\r\nthe open country, they knew, would be fatal to them. Accordingly,\r\nwhenever assailed by their persecutors, they fled to their mountain\r\nstrongholds, and there waited the attack of the enemy.\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest of such places--the Thermopylæ of the\r\nVaudois--was the valley of Angrogna, up which the inhabitants of La\r\nTour were accustomed to retreat on any sudden invasion by the army of\r\nSavoy. The valley is one of exquisite beauty, presenting a combination\r\nof mingled picturesqueness and sublimity, the like of which is rarely\r\nto be seen. It is hemmed in by mountains, in some places rounded and\r\nmajestic, in others jagged and abrupt. The sides of the valley are in\r\nmany places finely wooded, while in others well-tilled fields,\r\npastures, and vineyards slope down to the river-side. Orchards are\r\nsucceeded by pine-woods, and these again by farms and gardens.\r\nSometimes a little cascade leaps from a rock on its way to the valley\r\nbelow; and little is heard around, save the rippling of water, and the\r\noccasional lowing of cattle in the pastures, mingled with the music of\r\ntheir bells.\r\n\r\nShortly after entering the valley, we passed the scene of several\r\nterrible struggles between the Vaudois and their persecutors. One of\r\nthe most famous spots is the plateau of Rochemalan, where the heights\r\nof St. John abut upon the mountains of Angrogna. It was shortly after\r\nthe fulmination of a bull of extermination against the Vaudois by Pope\r\nInnocent VIII., in 1486, that an army of eighteen thousand regular\r\nFrench and Piedmontese troops, accompanied by a horde of brigands to\r\nwhom the remission of sins was promised on condition of their helping\r\nto slay the heretics, encircled the valleys and proceeded to assail\r\nthe Vaudois in their fastnesses. The Papal legate, Albert Catanée,\r\nArchdeacon of Cremona, had his head-quarters at Pignerol, from whence\r\nhe superintended the execution of the Pope's orders. First, he sent\r\npreaching monks up the valleys to attempt the conversion of the\r\nVaudois before attacking them with arms. But the peasantry refused to\r\nbe converted, and fled to their strongholds in the mountains.\r\n\r\nThen Catanée took the field at the head of his army, advancing upon\r\nAngrogna. He extended his lines so as to enclose the entire body of\r\nheretics, with the object of cutting them off to a man. The Vaudois,\r\nhowever, defended themselves resolutely, though armed only with pikes,\r\nswords, and bows and arrows, and everywhere beat back the assailants.\r\nThe severest struggle occurred at Rochemalan, which the crusaders\r\nattacked with great courage. But the Vaudois had the advantage of the\r\nhigher ground, and, encouraged by the cries and prayers of the women,\r\nchildren, and old men whom they were defending, they impetuously\r\nrushed forward and drove the Papal troops downhill in disorder,\r\npursuing them into the very plain.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Papalini renewed the attack, ascending by the bottom\r\nof the valley, instead of by the plateau on which they had been\r\ndefeated. But one of those dense mists, so common in the Alps, having\r\nsettled down upon the valley, the troops became confused, broken up,\r\nand entangled in difficult paths; and in this state, marching\r\napprehensively, they were fallen upon by the Vaudois and again\r\ncompletely defeated. Many of the soldiers slid over the rocks and were\r\ndrowned in the torrent,--the chasm into which the captain of the\r\ndetachment (Saquet de Planghère) fell, being still known as _Toumpi de\r\nSaquet_, or Saquet's Hole.\r\n\r\nThe resistance of the mountaineers at other points, in the valleys of\r\nPragela and St. Martin, having been almost equally successful, Catanée\r\nwithdrew the Papal army in disgust, and marched it back into France,\r\nto wreak his vengeance on the defenceless Vaudois of the Val Louise,\r\nin the manner described in a preceding chapter.\r\n\r\nLess than a century later, a like attempt was made to force the\r\nentrance to the valley of Angrogna, by an army of Italians and\r\nSpaniards, under the command of the Count de la Trinité. A\r\nproclamation had been published, and put up in the villages of\r\nAngrogna, to the effect that all would be destroyed by fire and sword\r\nwho did not forthwith return to the Church of Rome. And as the\r\npeasantry did not return, on the 2nd November, 1560, the Count\r\nadvanced at the head of his army to extirpate the heretics. The\r\nVaudois were provided with the rudest sort of weapons; many of them\r\nhad only slings and cross-bows. But they felt strong in the goodness\r\nof their cause, and prepared to defend themselves to the death.\r\n\r\nAs the Count's army advanced, the Vaudois retired until they reached\r\nthe high ground near Rochemalan, where they took their stand. The\r\nenemy followed, and halted in the valley beneath, lighting their\r\nbivouac fires, and intending to pass the night there. Before darkness\r\nfell, however, an accidental circumstance led to an engagement. A\r\nVaudois boy, who had got hold of a drum, began beating it in a ravine\r\nclose by. The soldiers, thinking a hostile troop had arrived, sprang\r\nup in disorder and seized their arms. The Vaudois, on their part,\r\nseeing the movement, and imagining that an attack was about to be made\r\non them, rushed forward to repel it. The soldiers, surprised and\r\nconfused, for the most part threw away their arms, and fled down the\r\nvalley. Irritated by this disgraceful retreat of some twelve hundred\r\nsoldiers before two hundred peasants, the Count advanced a second\r\ntime, and was again, repulsed by the little band of heroes, who\r\ncharged his troops with loud shouts of \"Viva Jesu Christo!\" driving\r\nthe invaders in confusion down the valley.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned that the object of the Savoy general, in making\r\nthis attack, was to force the valley, and capture the strong position\r\nof the Pra du Tour, the celebrated stronghold of the Vaudois, from\r\nwhence we shall afterwards find them, again driven back, baffled and\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\nA hundred years passed, and still the Vaudois remained unconverted and\r\nunexterminated. The Marquis of Pianesse now advanced upon\r\nAngrogna--always with the same object, \"ad extirpandos hereticos,\" in\r\nobedience to the order of the Propaganda. On this occasion not only\r\nItalian and Spanish but Irish troops were engaged in a combined effort\r\nto exterminate the Vaudois. The Irish were known as \"the assassins\"\r\nby the people of the valleys, because of their almost exceptional\r\nferocity; and the hatred they excited by their outrages on women and\r\nchildren was so great, that on the assault and capture of St. Legont\r\nby the Vaudois peasantry, an Irish regiment surprised in barracks was\r\ncompletely destroyed.\r\n\r\nA combined attack was made on Angrogna on the 15th of June, 1655. On\r\nthat day four separate bodies of troops advanced up the heights from\r\ndifferent directions, thereby enclosing the little Vaudois army of\r\nthree hundred men assembled there, and led by the heroic Javanel. This\r\nleader first threw himself upon the head of the column which advanced\r\nfrom Rocheplate, and drove it downhill. Then he drew off his little\r\nbody towards Rochemalan, when he suddenly found himself opposed by the\r\ntwo bodies which had come up from St. John and La Tour. Retiring\r\nbefore them, he next found himself face to face with the fourth\r\ndetachment, which had come up from Pramol. With the quick instinct of\r\nmilitary genius, Javanel threw himself upon it before the beaten\r\nRocheplate detachment were able to rally and assail him in flank; and\r\nhe succeeded in cutting the Pramol force in two and passing through\r\nit, rushing up to the summit of the hill, on which he posted himself.\r\nAnd there he stood at bay.\r\n\r\nThis hill is precipitous on one side, but of comparatively easy ascent\r\non the side up which the little band of heroes had ascended. At the\r\nfoot of the slope the four detachments, three thousand against three\r\nhundred, drew up and attacked him; but firing from a distance, their\r\naim was not very deadly. For five hours Javanel resisted them as he\r\nbest could, and then, seeing signs of impatience and hesitation in the\r\nenemy's ranks, he called out to his men, \"Forward, my friends!\" and\r\nthey rushed downhill like an avalanche. The three thousand men\r\nrecoiled, broke, and fled before the three hundred; and Javanel\r\nreturned victorious to his entrenchments before Angrogna.\r\n\r\nYet, again, some eight years later, in 1663, was this neighbourhood\r\nthe scene of another contest, and again was Javanel the hero. On this\r\noccasion, the Marquis de Fleury led the troops of the Duke of Savoy,\r\nwhose object, as before, was to advance up the valley, and assail the\r\nVaudois stronghold of Pra du Tour; and again the peasantry resisted\r\nthem successfully, and drove them back into the plains. Javanel then\r\nwent to rejoin a party of the men whom he had posted at the \"Gates of\r\nAngrogna\" to defend the pass up the valley; and again he fell upon the\r\nenemy engaged in attempting to force a passage there, and defeated\r\nthem with heavy loss.\r\n\r\nSuch are among the exciting events which have occurred in this one\r\nlocality in connection with the Vaudois struggle for country and\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed up the valley of Angrogna, towards the famous\r\nstronghold of the Pra du Tour, the object of those repeated attacks of\r\nthe enemy in the neighbourhood of Rochemalan. As we advance, the\r\nmountains gradually close in upon the valley, leaving a comparatively\r\nsmall width of pasture land by the river-side. At the hamlet of Serre\r\nthe carriage road ends; and from thence the valley grows narrower, the\r\nmountains which enclose it become more rugged and abrupt, until there\r\nis room enough only for a footpath along a rocky ledge, and the\r\ntorrent running in its deep bed alongside. This continues for a\r\nconsiderable distance, the path in some places being overhung by\r\nprecipices, or encroached upon by rocks and boulders fallen from the\r\nheights, until at length we emerge from the defile, and find ourselves\r\nin a comparatively open space, the famous Pra du Tour; the defile we\r\nhave passed, alongside the torrent and overhung by the rocks, being\r\nknown as the Barricade.\r\n\r\nThe Pra du Tour, or Meadow of the Tower, is a little amphitheatre\r\nsurrounded by rugged and almost inaccessible mountains, situated at\r\nthe head of the valley of Angrogna. The steep slopes bring down into\r\nthis deep dell the headwaters of the torrent, which escape among the\r\nrocks down the defile we have just ascended. The path up the defile\r\nforms the only approach to the Pra from the valley, but it is so\r\nnarrow, tortuous, and difficult, that the labours of only a few men in\r\nblocking up the pathway with rocks and stones that lie ready at hand,\r\nmight at any time so barricade the approach as to render it\r\nimpracticable. The extremely secluded position of the place, its\r\nnatural strength and inaccessibility, and its proximity to the\r\nprincipal Vaudois towns and villages, caused it to be regarded from\r\nthe earliest times as their principal refuge. It was their fastness,\r\ntheir fortress, and often their home. It was more--it was their school\r\nand college; for in the depths of the Pra du Tour the pastors, or\r\n_barbas_,[107] educated young men for the ministry, and provided for\r\nthe religious instruction of the Vaudois population.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 107: _Barba_--a title of respect; in the Vaudois\r\n         dialect literally signifying an _uncle_.]\r\n\r\nIt was the importance of the Pra du Tour as a stronghold that rendered\r\nit so often the object of attack through the valley of Angrogna. When\r\nthe hostile troops of Savoy advanced upon La Tour, the inhabitants of\r\nthe neighbouring valleys at once fled to the Pra, into which they\r\ndrove their cattle, and carried what provisions they could; there\r\nconstructing mills, ovens, houses, and all that was requisite for\r\nsubsistence, as in a fort. The men capable of bearing arms stood on\r\ntheir guard to defend the passes of the Vachére and Roussine, at the\r\nextreme heads of the valley, as well as the defile of the Barricade,\r\nwhile other bodies, stationed lower down, below the Barricade,\r\nprepared to resist the troops seeking to force an entrance up the\r\nvalley; and hence the repeated battles in the neighbourhood of\r\nRochemalan above described.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the defeat of the Count de la Trinité by the little\r\nVaudois band near the village of Angrogna, in November, 1560, the\r\ngeneral drew off, and waited the arrival of reinforcements. A large\r\nbody of Spanish veterans having joined him, in the course of the\r\nfollowing spring he again proceeded up the valley, determined, if\r\npossible, to force the Barricade--the royal forces now numbering some\r\nseven thousand men, all disciplined troops. The peasants, finding\r\ntheir first position no longer tenable in the face of such numbers,\r\nabandoned Angrogna and the lower villages, and retired, with the whole\r\npopulation, to the Pra du Tour. The Count followed them with his main\r\narmy, at the same time directing two other bodies of troops to advance\r\nupon the place round by the mountains, one by the heights of the\r\nVachére, and another by Les Fourests. The defenders of the Pra would\r\nthus be assailed from three sides at once, their forces divided, and\r\nvictory rendered certain.\r\n\r\nBut the Count did not calculate upon the desperate bravery of the\r\ndefenders. All three bodies were beaten back in succession. For four\r\ndays the Count made every effort to force the defile, and failed. Two\r\ncolonels, eight captains, and four hundred men fell in these desperate\r\nassaults, without gaining an inch of ground. On the fifth day a\r\ncombined attack was made with the reserve, composed of Spanish\r\ncompanies, but this, too, failed; and the troops, when ordered to\r\nreturn to the charge, refused to obey. The Count, who commanded, is\r\nsaid to have wept as he sat on a rock and looked upon so many of his\r\ndead--the soldiers themselves exclaiming, \"God fights for these\r\npeople, and we do them wrong!\"\r\n\r\nAbout a hundred years later, the Marquis de Pianesse, who, like the\r\nCount de la Trinité, had been defeated at Rochemalan, made a similar\r\nattempt to surprise the Vaudois stronghold, with a like result. The\r\npeasants were commanded on this occasion by John Leger, the pastor and\r\nhistorian. Those who were unarmed hurled rocks and stones on the\r\nassailants from the heights; and the troops being thus thrown into\r\nconfusion, the Vaudois rushed from behind their ramparts, and drove\r\nthem in a state of total rout down the valley.\r\n\r\nOn entering the Pra du Tour, one of the most prominent objects that\r\nmeets the eye is the Roman Catholic chapel recently erected there,\r\nthough the few inhabitants of the district are still almost entirely\r\nProtestant. The Roman Catholic Church has, however, now done what the\r\nRoman Catholic armies failed to do--established itself in the midst of\r\nthe Vaudois stronghold, though by no means in the hearts of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nDesirous of ascertaining, if possible, the site of the ancient\r\ncollege, we proceeded up the Pra, and hailed a young woman whom we\r\nobserved crossing the rustic bridge over the Pêle, one of the mountain\r\nrivulets running into the torrent of Angrogna. Inquiring of her as to\r\nthe site of the college, she told us we had already passed it, and led\r\nus back to the place--up the rocky side of the hill leading to the\r\nVachére--past the cottage where she herself lived, and pointed to the\r\nsite: \"There,\" she said, \"is where the ancient college of the Vaudois\r\nstood.\" The old building has, however, long since been removed, the\r\npresent structure being merely part of a small farmsteading. Higher up\r\nthe steep hill-side, on successive ledges of rock, are the ruins of\r\nvarious buildings, some of which may have been dwellings, and one,\r\nlarger than the rest, on a broader plateau, with an elder-tree growing\r\nin the centre, may possibly have been the temple.\r\n\r\nFrom the higher shelves on this mountain-side the view is extremely\r\nwild and grand. The acclivities which surround the head of the Pra\r\nseem as if battlemented walls; the mountain opposite throws its sombre\r\nshadow over the ravine in which the torrent runs; whilst, down the\r\nvalley, rock seems piled on rock, and mountain on mountain. All is\r\nperfectly still, and the silence is only audible by the occasional\r\ntinkling of a sheep-bell, or the humming of a bee in search of flowers\r\non the mountain-side. So peaceful and quiet is the place, that it is\r\ndifficult to believe it could ever have been the scene of such deadly\r\nstrife, and rung with the shouts of men thirsting for each other's\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nAfter lingering about the place until the sun was far on his way\r\ntowards the horizon, we returned, by the road we had come, the valley\r\nseeming more beautiful than ever under the glow of evening, and\r\narrived at our destination about dusk, to find the fireflies darting\r\nabout the streets of La Tour.\r\n\r\nThe next day saw us at Turin, and our summer excursion at an end. Mr.\r\nMilsom, who had so pleasantly accompanied me through the valleys, had\r\nbeen summoned to attend the death-bed of a friend at Antibes, and he\r\nset out on the journey forthwith. While still there, he received a\r\ntelegram intimating the death of his daughter at Allevard, near\r\nGrenoble, and he arrived only in time to attend her funeral. Two\r\nmonths later, he lost another dear daughter; shortly after, his\r\nmother-in-law died; and in the following December he himself died\r\nsuddenly of heart disease, and followed them to the grave.\r\n\r\nOne could not but conceive a hearty liking for Edward Milsom--he was\r\nsuch a thoroughly good man. He was a native of London, but spent the\r\ngreater part of his life at Lyons, in France, where he long since\r\nsettled and married. He there carried on a large business as a silk\r\nmerchant, but was always ready to give a portion of his time and money\r\nto help forward any good work. He was an \"ancien,\" or elder, of the\r\nEvangelical church at Lyons, originally founded by Adolphe Monod, to\r\nwhom he was also related by marriage.\r\n\r\nSome years since he was very much interested by the perusal of Pastor\r\nBost's account of his visit to the scene of Felix Neff's labours in\r\nthe High Alps. He felt touched by the simple, faithful character of\r\nthe people, and keenly sympathised with their destitute condition.\r\n\"Here,\" said he, \"is a field in which I may possibly be of some use.\"\r\nAnd he at once went to their help. He visited the district of\r\nFressinières, including the hamlet of Dormilhouse, as well as the more\r\ndistant villages of Arvieux and Sans Veran, up the vale of Queyras;\r\nand nearly every year thereafter he devoted a certain portion of his\r\ntime in visiting the poorer congregations of the district, giving them\r\nsuch help and succour as lay in his power.\r\n\r\nHis repeated visits made him well known to the people of the valleys,\r\nwho valued him as a friend, if they did not even love him as a\r\nbrother. His visits were also greatly esteemed by the pastors, who\r\nstood much in need of encouragement and help. He cheered the wavering,\r\nstrengthened the feeble-hearted, and stimulated all to renewed life\r\nand action. Wherever he went, a light seemed to shine in his path; and\r\nwhen he departed, he was followed by many blessings.\r\n\r\nIn one place he would arrange for the opening of a new place of\r\nworship; in another, for the opening of a boys' school; in a third,\r\nfor the industrial employment of girls; and wherever there was any\r\nlittle heartburning or jealousy to be allayed, he would set himself to\r\nremove it. His admirable tact, his unfailing temper, and excellent\r\ngood sense, rendered him a wise counsellor and a most successful\r\nconciliator.\r\n\r\nThe last time Mr. Milsom visited England, towards the end of 1869, he\r\nwas occupied, as usual, in collecting subscriptions for the poor\r\nVaudois of the High Alps. Now that the good \"merchant missionary\" has\r\nrested from his labours, they will indeed feel the loss of their\r\nfriend. Who is to assume his mantle?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE GLORIOUS RETURN:\r\n\r\nAN EPISODE IN THE HISTORY OF THE ITALIAN VAUDOIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is known as The Glorious Return, or re-entry of the exiled\r\nVaudois in 1689 to resume possession of the valleys from which they\r\nhad been banished, will always stand out as one of the most remarkable\r\nevents in history.\r\n\r\nIf ever a people fairly established their right to live in their own\r\ncountry, and to worship God after their own methods, the Vaudois had\r\nsurely done so. They had held conscientiously and consistently to\r\ntheir religion for nearly five hundred years, during which they\r\nlaboured under many disabilities and suffered much persecution. But\r\nthe successive Dukes of Savoy were no better satisfied with them as\r\nsubjects than before. They could not brook that any part of their\r\npeople should be of a different form of religion from that professed\r\nby themselves; and they continued, at the instance of successive\r\npopes, to let slip the dogs of war upon the valleys, in the hopes of\r\neventually compelling the Vaudois to \"come in\" and make their peace\r\nwith the Church.\r\n\r\nThe result of these invasions was almost uniform. At the first sudden\r\ninroad of the troops, the people, taken by surprise, usually took to\r\nflight; on which their dwellings were burnt and their fields laid\r\nwaste. But when they had time to rally and collect their forces, the\r\nalmost invariable result was that the Piedmontese were driven out of\r\nthe valleys again with ignominy and loss. The Duke's invasion of 1655\r\nwas, however, attended with greater success than usual. His armies\r\noccupied the greater part of the valleys, though the Vaudois still\r\nheld out, and made occasional successful sallies from their mountain\r\nfastnesses. At length, the Protestants of the Swiss Confederation,\r\ntaking compassion on their co-religionists in Piedmont, sent\r\nambassadors to the Duke of Savoy at Turin to intercede for their\r\nrelief; and the result was the amnesty granted to them in that year\r\nunder the title of the \"Patents of Grace.\" The terms were very hard,\r\nbut they were agreed to. The Vaudois were to be permitted to re-occupy\r\ntheir valleys, conditional on their rebuilding all the Catholic\r\nchurches which had been destroyed, paying to the Duke an indemnity of\r\nfifty thousand francs, and ceding to him the richest lands in the\r\nvalley of Luzerna--the last relics of their fortunes being thus taken\r\nfrom them to remunerate the barbarity of their persecutors.\r\n\r\nIt was also stipulated by this treaty, that the pastors of the Vaudois\r\nchurches were to be natives of the district only, and that they were\r\nto be at liberty to administer religious instruction in their own\r\nmanner in all the Vaudois parishes, excepting that of St. John, near\r\nLa Tour, where their worship was interdicted. The only persons\r\nexcepted from the terms of the amnesty were Javanel, the heroic old\r\ncaptain, and Jean Leger, the pastor-historian, the most prominent\r\nleaders of the Vaudois in the recent war, both of whom were declared\r\nto be banished the ducal dominions.\r\n\r\nUnder this treaty the Vaudois enjoyed peace for about thirty years,\r\nduring which they restored the cultivation of the valleys, rebuilt the\r\nvillages, and were acknowledged to be among the most loyal, peaceable,\r\nand industrious of the subjects of Savoy.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, certain parts of the valleys to which the amnesty\r\ngranted by the Duke did not apply. Thus, it did not apply to the\r\nvalleys of Pérouse and Pragela, which did not then form part of the\r\ndominions of Savoy, but were included within the French frontier. It\r\nwas out of this circumstance that a difficulty arose with the French\r\nmonarch, which issued in the revival of the persecution in the\r\nvalleys, the banishment of the Vaudois into Switzerland, and their\r\neventual \"Glorious Return\" in the manner we are about briefly to\r\nnarrate.\r\n\r\nWhen Louis XIV. of France revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685, and\r\ninterdicted all Protestant worship throughout his dominions, the law\r\nof course applied to the valleys of Pérouse and Pragela as to the\r\nother parts of France. The Vaudois pastors were banished, and the\r\npeople were forbidden to profess any other religion than that\r\nprescribed by the King, under penalty of confiscation of their goods,\r\nimprisonment, or banishment. The Vaudois who desired to avoid these\r\npenalties while they still remained staunch to their faith, did what\r\nso many Frenchmen then did--they fled across the frontier and took\r\nrefuge in foreign lands. Some of the inhabitants of the French valleys\r\nwent northward into Switzerland, while others passed across the\r\nmountains towards the south, and took refuge in the valley of the\r\nPelice, where the Vaudois religion continued to be tolerated under\r\nthe terms of the amnesty above referred to, which had been granted by\r\nthe Duke of Savoy.\r\n\r\nThe French king, when he found his Huguenot subjects flying in all\r\ndirections rather than remain in France and be \"converted\" to Roman\r\nCatholicism, next tried to block up the various avenues of escape, and\r\nto prevent the rulers of the adjoining countries from giving the\r\nfugitives asylum. Great was his displeasure when he heard of the\r\nflight of the Vaudois of Pérouse and Pragela into the adjoining\r\nvalleys. He directed the French ambassador at Turin to call upon the\r\nDuke of Savoy, and require him to prevent their settlement within his\r\ndominions. At the same time, he called upon the Duke to take steps to\r\ncompel the conversion of his people from the pretended reformed faith,\r\nand offered the aid of his troops to enforce their submission, \"at\r\nwhatever cost.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke was irritated at the manner in which he was approached. Louis\r\nXIV. was treating him as a vassal of France rather than as an\r\nindependent sovereign. But he felt himself to be weak, and\r\ncomparatively powerless to resent the insult. So he first temporised,\r\nthen vacillated, and being again pressed by the French king, he\r\neventually yielded. The amnesty was declared to be at an end, and the\r\nVaudois were ordered forthwith to become members of the Church of\r\nRome. An edict was issued on the 31st of January, 1686, forbidding the\r\nexercise by the Vaudois of their religion, abolishing their ancient\r\nprivileges, and ordering the demolition of all their places of\r\nworship. Pastors and schoolmasters who refused to be converted were\r\nordered to quit the country within fifteen days, on pain of death and\r\nconfiscation of their goods. All refugee Protestants from France were\r\nordered to leave under the same penalty. All children born of\r\nProtestant parents were to be compulsorily educated as Roman\r\nCatholics. This barbarous measure was merely a repetition by the Duke\r\nof Savoy in Piedmont of what his master Louis XIV. had already done in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe Vaudois expostulated with their sovereign, but in vain. They\r\npetitioned, but there was no reply. They requested the interposition\r\nof the Swiss Government as before, but the Duke took no notice of\r\ntheir memorial. The question of resistance was then discussed; but the\r\npeople were without leaders. Javanel was living in banishment at\r\nGeneva--old and worn out, and unable to lead them. Besides, the\r\nVaudois, before taking up arms, wished to exhaust every means of\r\nconciliation. Ambassadors next came from Switzerland, who urged them\r\nto submit to the clemency of the Duke, and suggested that they should\r\npetition him for permission to leave the country! The Vaudois were\r\nstupefied by the proposal. They were thus asked, without a contest, to\r\nsubmit to all the ignominy and punishment of defeat, and to terminate\r\ntheir very existence as a people! The ambassadors represented that\r\nresistance to the combined armies of Savoy, France, and Spain, without\r\nleaders, and with less than three thousand combatants, was little\r\nshort of madness.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a number of the Vaudois determined not to leave their\r\nvalleys without an attempt to hold them, as they had so often\r\nsuccessfully done before. The united armies of France and Savoy then\r\nadvanced upon the valleys, and arrangements were made for a general\r\nattack upon the Vaudois position on Easter Monday, 1686, at break of\r\nday,--the Duke of Savoy assailing the valley of Luzerna, while\r\nCatinat, commander of the French troops, advanced on St. Martin.\r\nCatinat made the first attack on the village of St. Germain, and was\r\nbeaten back with heavy loss after six hours' fighting. Henry Arnaud,\r\nthe Huguenot pastor from Die in Dauphiny, of which he was a native,\r\nparticularly distinguished himself by his bravery in this affair, and\r\nfrom that time began to be regarded as one of the most promising of\r\nthe Vaudois leaders.\r\n\r\nCatinat renewed the attack on the following day with the assistance of\r\nfresh troops; and he eventually succeeded in overcoming the resistance\r\nof the handful of men who opposed him, and sweeping the valley of St.\r\nMartin. Men, women, and children were indiscriminately put to the\r\nsword. In some of the parishes no resistance was offered, the\r\ninhabitants submitting to the Duke's proclamation; but whether they\r\nsubmitted or not, made no difference in their treatment, which was\r\nbarbarous in all cases.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Duke of Savoy's army advanced from the vale of Luzerna\r\nupon the celebrated heights of Angrogna, and assailed the Vaudois\r\nassembled there at all points. The resistance lasted for an entire\r\nday, and when night fell, both forces slept on the ground upon which\r\nthey had fought, kindling their bivouac fires on both sides. On the\r\nfollowing day the attack was renewed, and again the battle raged until\r\nnight. Then Don Gabriel of Savoy, who was in command, resolved to\r\nemploy the means which Catinat had found so successful: he sent\r\nforward messengers to inform the Vaudois that their brethren of the\r\nVal St. Martin had laid down their arms and been pardoned, inviting\r\nthem to follow their example. The result of further parley was, that\r\non the express promise of his Royal Highness that they should receive\r\npardon, and that neither their persons nor those of their wives or\r\nchildren should be touched, the credulous Vaudois, still hoping for\r\nfair treatment, laid down their arms, and permitted the ducal troops\r\nto take possession of their entrenchments!\r\n\r\nThe same treacherous strategy proved equally successful against the\r\ndefenders of the Pra du Tour. After beating back their assailants and\r\nfirmly holding their ground for an entire day, they were told of the\r\nsurrender of their compatriots, promised a full pardon, and assured of\r\nlife and liberty, on condition of immediately ceasing further\r\nhostilities. They accordingly consented to lay down their arms, and\r\nthe impregnable fastness of the Pra du Tour, which had never been\r\ntaken by force, thus fell before falsehood and perfidy. \"The defenders\r\nof this ancient sanctuary of the Church,\" says Dr. Huston, \"were\r\nloaded with irons; their children were carried off and scattered\r\nthrough the Roman Catholic districts; their wives and daughters were\r\nviolated, massacred, or made captives. As for those that still\r\nremained, all whom the enemy could seize became a prey devoted to\r\ncarnage, spoliation, fire, excesses which cannot be told, and outrages\r\nwhich it would be impossible to describe.\"[108]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 108: Huston's \"Israel of the Alps,\" translated by\r\n         Montgomery; Glasgow, 1857; vol. i. p. 446.]\r\n\r\n\"All the valleys are now exterminated,\" wrote a French officer to his\r\nfriends; \"the people are all killed, hanged, or massacred.\" The Duke,\r\nVictor Amadeus, issued a decree, declaring the Vaudois to be guilty of\r\nhigh treason, and confiscating all their property. Arnaud says as many\r\nas eleven thousand persons were killed, or perished in prison, or died\r\nof want, in consequence of this horrible Easter festival of blood.\r\nSix thousand were taken prisoners, and the greater number of these\r\ndied in gaol of hunger and disease. When the prisons were opened, and\r\nthe wretched survivors were ordered to quit the country, forbidden to\r\nreturn to it on pain of death, only about two thousand six hundred\r\ncontrived to struggle across the frontier into Switzerland.\r\n\r\nAnd thus at last the Vaudois Church seemed utterly uprooted and\r\ndestroyed. What the Dukes of Savoy had so often attempted in vain was\r\nnow accomplished. A second St. Bartholomew had been achieved, and Rome\r\nrang with _Te Deums_ in praise of the final dispersion of the Vaudois.\r\nThe Pope sent to Victor Amadeus II. a special brief, congratulating\r\nhim on the extirpation of heresy in his dominions; and Piedmontese and\r\nSavoyards, good Catholics, were presented with the lands from which\r\nthe Vaudois had been driven. Those of them who remained in the country\r\n\"unconverted\" were as so many scattered fugitives in the\r\nmountains--sheep wandering about without a shepherd. Some of the\r\nVaudois, for the sake of their families and homes, pretended\r\nconversion; but these are admitted to have been comparatively few in\r\nnumber. In short, the \"Israel of the Alps\" seemed to be no more, and\r\nits people utterly and for ever dispersed. Pierre Allix, the Huguenot\r\nrefugee pastor in England, in his \"History of the Ancient Churches of\r\nPiedmont,\" dedicated to William III., regarded the Vaudois Church as\r\nobliterated--\"their present desolation seeming so universal, that the\r\nworld looks upon them no otherwise than as irrecoverably lost, and\r\nfinally destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nThree years passed. The expelled Vaudois reached Switzerland in\r\ngreatly reduced numbers, many women and children having perished on\r\ntheir mountain journey. The inhabitants of Geneva received them with\r\ngreat hospitality, clothing and feeding them until they were able to\r\nproceed on their way northward. Some went into Brandenburg, some into\r\nHolland, while others settled to various branches of industry in\r\ndifferent parts of Switzerland. Many of them, however, experienced\r\ngreat difficulty in obtaining a settlement. Those who had entered the\r\nPalatinate were driven thence by war, and those who had entered\r\nWurtemburg were expelled by the Grand Duke, who feared incurring the\r\nire of Louis XIV. by giving them shelter and protection. Hence many\r\nlittle bands of the Vaudois refugees long continued to wander along\r\nthe valley of the Rhine, unable to find rest for their weary feet.\r\nThere were others trying to earn, a precarious living in Geneva and\r\nLausanne, and along the shores of Lake Leman. Some of these were men\r\nwho had fought under Javanel in his heroic combats with the\r\nPiedmontese; and they thought with bitter grief of the manner in which\r\nthey had fallen into the trap of Catinat and the Duke of Savoy, and\r\nabandoned their country almost without a struggle.\r\n\r\nThen it was that the thought occurred to them whether they might not\r\nyet strike a blow for the recovery of their valleys! The idea seemed\r\nchimerical in the extreme. A few hundred destitute men, however\r\nvaliant, to think of recovering a country defended by the combined\r\narmies of France and Savoy! Javanel, the old Vaudois hero, disabled by\r\nage and wounds, was still alive--an exile at Geneva--and he was\r\nconsulted on the subject. Javanel embraced the project with,\r\nenthusiasm; and the invasion of the valleys was resolved upon! A more\r\ndaring, and apparently more desperate enterprise, was never planned.\r\n\r\nWho was to be their leader? Javanel himself was disabled. Though his\r\nmind was clear, and his patriotic ardour unquenched, his body was\r\nweak; and all that he could do was to encourage and advise. But he\r\nfound a noble substitute in Henry Arnaud, the Huguenot refugee, who\r\nhad already distinguished himself in his resistance to the troops of\r\nSavoy. And Arnaud was now ready to offer up his life for the recovery\r\nof the valleys.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise was kept as secret as possible, yet not so close as to\r\nprevent the authorities of Berne obtaining some inkling of their\r\nintentions. Three confidential messengers were first dispatched to the\r\nvalleys to ascertain the disposition of the population, and more\r\nparticularly to examine the best route by which an invasion might be\r\nmade. On their return with the necessary information, the plan was\r\nsettled by Javanel, as it was to be carried out by Arnaud. In the\r\nmeantime, the magistrates of Geneva, having obtained information as to\r\nthe intended movement, desirous of averting the hostility of France\r\nand Savoy, required Javanel to leave their city, and he at once\r\nretired to Ouchy, a little farther up the lake.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty experienced by the Vaudois in carrying out\r\ntheir enterprise was the want of means. They were poor, destitute\r\nrefugees, without arms, ammunition, or money to buy them. To obtain\r\nthe requisite means, Arnaud made a journey into Holland, for the\r\npurpose of communicating the intended project to William of Orange.\r\nWilliam entered cordially into the proposed plan, recommended Arnaud\r\nto several Huguenot officers, who afterwards took part in the\r\nexpedition, supplied him with assistance in money, and encouraged him\r\nto carry out the design. Several private persons in Holland--amongst\r\nothers the post-master-general at Leyden--also largely contributed to\r\nthe enterprise.\r\n\r\nAt length all was ready. The men who intended to take part in the\r\nexpedition came together from various quarters. Some came from\r\nBrandenburg, others from Bavaria and distant parts of Switzerland; and\r\namong those who joined them was a body of French Huguenots, willing to\r\nshare in their dangers and their glory. One of their number, Captain\r\nTurrel, like Arnaud, a native of Die in Dauphiny, was even elected as\r\nthe general of the expedition. Their rendez-vous was in the forest of\r\nPrangins, near Nyon, on the north bank of the Lake of Geneva; and\r\nthere, on the night of the 16th of August, 1689, they met in the\r\nhollow recesses of the wood. Fifteen boats had been got together, and\r\nlay off the shore. After a fervent prayer by the pastor-general\r\nArnaud, imploring a blessing upon the enterprise, as many of the men\r\nas could embark got into the boats. As the lake is there at its\r\nnarrowest, they soon rowed across to the other side, near the town of\r\nYvoire, and disembarked on the shore of Savoy. Arnaud had posted\r\nsentinels in all directions, and the little body waited the arrival of\r\nthe remainder of their comrades from the opposite shore. They had all\r\ncrossed the lake by two o'clock in the morning; and about eight\r\nhundred men, divided into nineteen companies,[109] each provided with\r\nits captain, were now ready to march.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 109: Of the nineteen companies three were composed\r\n         of the Vaudois of Angrogna; those of Bobi and St. John\r\n         furnished two each; and those of La Tour, Villar, Prarustin,\r\n         Prali, Macel, St. Germain, and Pramol, furnished one each.\r\n         The remaining six companies were composed of French Huguenot\r\n         refugees from Dauphiny and Languedoc under their respective\r\n         officers. Besides these, there were different smaller parties\r\n         who constituted a volunteer company. The entire force of\r\n         about eight hundred men was marshalled in three\r\n         divisions--vanguard, main body, and rearguard--and this\r\n         arrangement was strictly observed in the order of march.]\r\n\r\nAt the very commencement, however, they met with a misfortune. One of\r\nthe pastors, having gone to seek a guide in the village near at hand,\r\nwas seized as a prisoner by the local authorities, and carried off. On\r\nthis, the Vaudois, seeing that they were treated as enemies, sent a\r\nparty to summon Yvoire to open its gates, and it obeyed. The lord of\r\nthe manor and the receiver of taxes were taken as hostages, and made\r\nto accompany the troop until they reached the next commune, when they\r\nwere set at liberty, and replaced by other hostages.\r\n\r\nWhen it became known that the little army of Vaudois had set out on\r\ntheir march, troops were dispatched from all quarters to intercept\r\nthem and cut them off; and it was believed that their destruction was\r\ninevitable. \"What possible chance is there,\" asked the _Historic\r\nMercury_ of the day, \"of this small body of men penetrating to their\r\nnative country through the masses of French and Piedmontese troops\r\naccumulating from all sides, without being crushed and exterminated?\"\r\n\"It is impossible,\" wrote the _Leyden Gazette_, \"notwithstanding\r\nwhatever precautions they may take, that the Vaudois can extricate\r\nthemselves without certain death, and the Court of Savoy may therefore\r\nregard itself safe so far as they are concerned.\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the boats left the shore at Nyon for the further side of\r\nthe lake than the young seigneur of Prangins, who had been watching\r\ntheir movements, rode off at full speed to inform the French resident\r\nat Geneva of the departure of the Vaudois; and orders were at once\r\ndispatched to Lyons for a strong body of cavalry to march immediately\r\ntowards Savoy to cut them off. But the Vaudois had well matured their\r\nplans, and took care to keep out of reach of the advancing enemy.\r\nTheir route at first lay up the valleys towards the mountains, whose\r\ncrests they followed, from glacier to glacier, in places almost\r\ninaccessible to regular troops, and thus they eluded the combined\r\nforces of France and Savoy, which, vainly endeavoured to bar their\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nThe first day's march led them into the valley of the Arve, by the Col\r\nde Voirons, from which they took their last view of the peaceful Lake\r\nof Geneva; thence they proceeded by the pyramidal mountain called the\r\nMole to the little town of Viu, where they rested for two hours,\r\nstarting again by moonlight, and passing through St. Joire, where the\r\nmagistrates brought out a great cask of wine, and placed it in the\r\nmiddle of the street for their refreshment. The little army, however,\r\ndid not halt there, but marched on to the bare hill of Carman, where,\r\nafter solemn prayer, they encamped about midnight, sleeping on the\r\nbare ground. Next day found them in front of the small walled town of\r\nCluse, in the rocky gorge of the Arve. The authorities shut the gates,\r\non which the Vaudois threatened to storm the place, when the gates\r\nwere opened, and they marched through the town, the inhabitants\r\nstanding under arms along both sides of the street. Here the Vaudois\r\npurchased a store of food and wine, which they duly paid for.\r\n\r\nThey then proceeded on to Sallanches, where resistance was threatened.\r\nThey found a body of men posted on the wooden bridge which there\r\nseparated the village of St. Martin from Sallanches; but rushing\r\nforward, the defenders of the bridge fled, and the little army passed\r\nover and proceeded to range themselves in order of battle over against\r\nthe town, which was defended by six hundred troops. The Vaudois having\r\nthreatened to burn the town, and kill the hostages whom they had taken\r\non the slightest show of resistance, the threat had its effect, and\r\nthey were permitted to pass without further opposition, encamping for\r\nthe night at a little village about a league further on. And thus\r\nclosed the second day's march.\r\n\r\nThe third day they passed over the mountains of Lez Pras and Haute\r\nLuce, seven thousand feet above the sea-level, a long and fatiguing\r\nmarch. At one place the guide lost his way, and rain fell heavily,\r\nsoaking the men to the skin. They spent a wretched night in some empty\r\nstables at the hamlet of St. Nicholas de Verose; and started earlier\r\nthan usual on the following morning, addressing themselves to the\r\nformidable work of climbing the Col Bonhomme, which they passed with\r\nthe snow up to their knees. They were now upon the crest of the Alps,\r\nlooking down upon the valley of the Isère, into which they next\r\ndescended. They traversed the valley without resistance, passing\r\nthrough St. Germain and Scez, turning aside at the last-mentioned\r\nplace up the valley of Tignes, thereby avoiding the French troops\r\nlying in wait for them in the neighbourhood of Moutiers, lower down\r\nthe valley of the Isère. Later in the evening they reached Laval, at\r\nthe foot of Mont Iseran; and here Arnaud, for the first time during\r\neight days, snatched a few hours' sleep on a bed in the village.\r\n\r\nThe sixth day saw the little army climbing the steep slopes of Mont\r\nIseran, where the shepherds gave them milk and wished them God-speed;\r\nbut they warned them that a body of troops lay in their way at Mont\r\nCenis. On they went--over the mountain, and along the crest of the\r\nchain, until they saw Bonneval in the valley beneath them, and there\r\nthey descended, passing on to Bessant in the valley of the Arc, where\r\nthey encamped for the night.\r\n\r\nNext day they marched on Mont Cenis, which they ascended. As they were\r\ncrossing the mountain a strange incident occurred. The Vaudois saw\r\nbefore them a large convoy of mules loaded with baggage. And shortly\r\nafter there came up the carriage and equipage of some grand personage.\r\nIt proved to be Cardinal Ranuzzi, on his way to Rome to take part in\r\nthe election of Pope Alexander VIII. The Vaudois seized the mules\r\ncarrying the baggage, which contained important documents compromising\r\nLouis XIV. with Victor Amadeus; and it is said that in consequence of\r\ntheir loss, the Cardinal, who himself aspired to the tiara, afterwards\r\ndied of chagrin, crying in his last moments, \"My papers! oh, my\r\npapers!\"\r\n\r\nThe passage of the Great and Little Cenis was effected with great\r\ndifficulty. The snow lay thick on the ground, though it was the month\r\nof August, and the travellers descended the mountain of Tourliers by a\r\nprecipice rather than a road. When night fell, they were still\r\nscattered on the mountain, and lay down to snatch a brief sleep,\r\novercome with hunger and fatigue. Next morning they gathered together\r\nagain, and descended into the sterile valley of the Gaillon, and\r\nshortly after proceeded to ascend the mountain opposite.\r\n\r\nThey were now close upon the large towns. Susa lay a little to the\r\neast, and Exilles was directly in their way. The garrison of the\r\nlatter place came out to meet them, and from the crest of the mountain\r\nrolled large stones and flung grenades down upon the invaders. Here\r\nthe Vaudois lost some men and prisoners, and finding the further\r\nascent impracticable, they retreated into the valley from which they\r\nhad come, and again ascended the steep slope of Tourliers in order to\r\nturn the heights on which the French troops were posted. At last,\r\nafter great fatigue and peril, unable to proceed further, they gained\r\nthe crest of the mountain, and sounded their clarions to summon the\r\nscattered body.\r\n\r\nAfter a halt of two hours they proceeded along the ridge, and\r\nperceived through the mist a body of soldiers marching along with\r\ndrums beating; it was the garrison of Exilles. The Vaudois were\r\nrecognised and followed by the soldiers at a distance. Proceeding a\r\nlittle further, they came in sight of the long valley of the Doire,\r\nand looking down into it, not far from the bridge of Salabertrans,\r\nthey discerned some thirty-six bivouac fires burning on the plain,\r\nindicating the presence of a large force. These were their enemies--a\r\nwell-appointed army of some two thousand five hundred men--whom they\r\nwere at last to meet in battle. Nothing discouraged, they descended\r\ninto the valley, and the advanced guard shortly came in contact with\r\nthe enemy's outposts. Firing between them went on for an hour and a\r\nhalf, and then night fell.\r\n\r\nThe Vaudois leaders held a council to determine what they should do;\r\nand the result was, that an immediate attack was resolved upon, in\r\nthree bodies. The principal attack was made on the bridge, the passage\r\nof which was defended by a strong body of French soldiers, under the\r\ncommand of Colonel de Larrey. On the advance of the Vaudois in the\r\ndarkness, they were summoned to stand, but continued to advance, when\r\nthe enemy fired a volley on them, killing three men. Then the Vaudois\r\nbrigade rushed to the bridge, but seeing a strong body on the other\r\nside preparing to fire again, Arnaud called upon his men to lie down,\r\nand the volley went over their heads. Then Turrel, the Vaudois\r\ncaptain, calling out \"Forward! the bridge is won!\" the Vaudois jumped\r\nto their feet and rushed on. The two wings at the same time\r\nconcentrated their fire on the defenders, who broke and retired, and\r\nthe bridge was won. But at the further side, where the French were in\r\noverpowering numbers, they refused to give way, and poured down their\r\nfire on their assailants. The Vaudois boldly pressed on. They burst\r\nthrough the French, force, cutting it in two; and fresh men pouring\r\nover, the battle was soon won. The French, commander was especially\r\nchagrined at having been beaten by a parcel of cowherds. \"Is it\r\npossible,\" he exclaimed, \"that I have lost both the battle and my\r\nhonour?\"\r\n\r\nThe rising moon showed the ground strewed with about seven hundred\r\ndead; the Vaudois having lost only twenty-two killed and eight\r\nwounded. The victors filled their pouches with ammunition picked up on\r\nthe field, took possession of as many arms and as much provisions as\r\nthey could carry, and placing the remainder in a heap over some\r\nbarrels of powder, they affixed a lighted match and withdrew. A\r\ntremendous explosion shook the mountains, and echoed along the valley,\r\nand the remains of the French camp were blown to atoms. The Vaudois\r\nthen proceeded at once to climb the mountain of Sci, which had to be\r\ncrossed in order to enter the valley of Pragelas.\r\n\r\nIt was early on a Sabbath morning, the ninth day of their march, that\r\nthe Vaudois reached the crest of the mountain overlooking\r\nFenestrelles, and saw spread out before them the beloved country which\r\nthey had come to win. They halted for the stragglers, and when these\r\nhad come up, Arnaud made them kneel down and thank God for permitting\r\nthem again to see their native land; himself offering up an eloquent\r\nprayer, which cheered and strengthened them for further effort. And\r\nthen they descended into the valley of Pragelas, passing the river\r\nClusone, and halting to rest at the little village of La Traverse.\r\nThey were now close to the Vaudois strongholds, and in a country every\r\nfoot of which was familiar to most of them. But their danger was by no\r\nmeans over; for the valleys were swarming with dragoons and\r\nfoot-soldiers; and when they had shaken off those of France, they had\r\nstill to encounter the troops of Savoy.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon the little army again set out for the valley of\r\nSt. Martin, passing the night in the mountain hamlet of Jussand, the\r\nhighest on the Col du Pis. Next day they descended the Col near Seras,\r\nand first came in contact with the troops of Savoy; but these having\r\ntaken to flight, no collision occurred; and on the following day the\r\nVaudois arrived, without further molestation, at the famous Balsille.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated stronghold is situated in front of the narrow defile\r\nof Macel, which leads into the valley of St. Martin. It is a rampart\r\nof rock, standing at the entrance to the pass, and is of such natural\r\nstrength, that but little art was needed to make it secure against any\r\nforce that could be brought against it. There is only one approach to\r\nit from the valley of St. Martin, which is very difficult; a portion\r\nof the way being in a deep wooded gorge, where a few men could easily\r\narrest the progress of an army. The rock itself consists of three\r\nnatural stages or terraces, the highest part rising steep as a wall,\r\nbeing surmounted by a natural platform. The mountain was well supplied\r\nwith water, which gushed forth in several places. Caverns had been\r\nhollowed out in the sides of the rocks, which served as hiding-places\r\nduring the persecutions which so often ravaged the valleys; and these\r\nwere now available for storehouses and barracks.\r\n\r\nThe place was, indeed, so intimately identified with the past\r\nsufferings and triumphs of the Vaudois, and it was, besides, so\r\ncentrally situated, and so secure, that they came to regard its\r\npossession as essential to the success of their enterprise. The aged\r\nJavanel, who drew up the plan of the invasion before the eight hundred\r\nset out on their march, attached the greatest importance to its early\r\noccupation. \"Spare no labour nor pains,\" he said, in the memorandum of\r\ndirections which he drew up, \"in fortifying this post, which will be\r\nyour most secure fortress. Do not quit it unless in the utmost\r\nextremity.... You will, of course, be told that you cannot hold it\r\nalways, and that rather than not succeed in their object, all France\r\nand Italy will gather together against you.... But were it the whole\r\nworld, and only yourselves against all, fear ye the Almighty alone,\r\nwho is your protection.\"\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the Vaudois at the Balsille, they discerned a small\r\nbody of troops advancing towards them by the Col du Pis, higher up the\r\nvalley. They proved to be Piedmontese, forty-six in number, sent to\r\noccupy the pass. They were surrounded, disarmed, and put to death, and\r\ntheir arms were hid away amongst the rocks. No quarter was given on\r\neither side during this war; the Vaudois had no prisons in which to\r\nplace their captives; and they themselves, when taken, were treated\r\nnot as soldiers, but as bandits, being instantly hung on the nearest\r\ntrees. The Vaudois did not, however, yet take up their permanent\r\nposition at the Balsille, being desirous of rousing the valleys\r\ntowards the south. The day following, accordingly, they marched to\r\nPralis, in the valley of the Germanasca, when, for the first time\r\nsince their exile, they celebrated Divine worship in one of the\r\ntemples of their ancestors.\r\n\r\nThey were now on their way towards the valley of the Pelice, to reach\r\nwhich it was necessary that they should pass over the Col Julian. An\r\narmy of three thousand Piedmontese barred their way, but nothing\r\ndaunted by the great disparity of force, the Vaudois, divided into\r\nthree bodies, as at Salabertrans, mounted to the assault. As they\r\nadvanced, the Piedmontese cried, \"Come on, ye devil's Barbets, there\r\nare more than three thousand of us, and we occupy all the posts!\" In\r\nless than half an hour the whole of the posts were carried, the pass\r\nwas cleared, and the Piedmontese fled down the further side of the\r\nmountain, leaving all their stores behind them. On the following day\r\nthe Vaudois reached Bobi, drove out the new settlers, and resumed\r\npossession of the lands of the commune. Thus, after the lapse of only\r\nfourteen days, this little band of heroes had marched from the shores\r\nof the Lake of Geneva, by difficult mountain-passes, through bands of\r\nhostile troops, which they had defeated in two severe fights, and at\r\nlength reached the very centre of the Vaudois valleys, and entered\r\ninto possession of the \"Promised Land.\"\r\n\r\nThey resolved to celebrate their return to the country of their\r\nfathers by an act of solemn worship on the Sabbath following. The\r\nwhole body assembled on the hill of Silaoud, commanding an extensive\r\nprospect of the valley, and with their arms piled, and resting under\r\nthe shade of the chestnut-trees which crown the hill, they listened to\r\nan eloquent sermon from the pastor Montoux, who preached to them\r\nstanding on a platform, consisting of a door resting upon two rocks,\r\nafter which they chanted the 74th Psalm, to the clash of arms. They\r\nthen proceeded to enter into a solemn covenant with each other,\r\nrenewing the ancient oath of union of the valleys, and swearing never\r\nto rest from their enterprise, even if they should be reduced to only\r\nthree or four in number, until they had \"re-established in the valleys\r\nthe kingdom of the Gospel.\" Shortly after, they proceeded to divide\r\nthemselves into two bodies, for the purpose of occupying\r\nsimultaneously, as recommended by Javanel, the two valleys of the\r\nPelice and St. Martin.\r\n\r\nBut the trials and sufferings they had already endured were as nothing\r\ncompared with those they were now about to experience. Armies\r\nconcentrated on them from all points. They were pressed by the French\r\non the north and west, and by the Piedmontese on the south and east.\r\nEncouraged by their success at Bobi, the Vaudois rashly attacked\r\nVillar, lower down the valley, and were repulsed with loss. From\r\nthence they retired up the valley of Rora, and laid it waste; the\r\nenemy, in like manner, destroying the town of Bobi and laying waste\r\nthe neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe war now became one of reprisals and mutual devastation, the two\r\nparties seeking to deprive each other of shelter and the means of\r\nsubsistence. The Vaudois could only obtain food by capturing the\r\nenemy's convoys, levying contributions from the plains, and making\r\nincursions into Dauphiny. The enterprise on which they had entered\r\nseemed to become more hopeless from day to day. This handful of men,\r\nhalf famished and clothed in rags, had now arrayed against them\r\ntwenty-two thousand French and Sardinians, provided with all the\r\nmunitions of war. That they should have been able to stand against\r\nthem for two whole months, now fighting in one place, and perhaps the\r\nnext day some twenty miles across the mountains in another, with\r\nalmost invariable success, seems little short of a miracle. But flesh\r\nand blood could not endure such toil and privations much longer. No\r\nwonder that the faint-hearted began to despair. Turrel, the military\r\ncommander, seeing no chance of a prosperous issue, withdrew across the\r\nFrench frontier, followed by the greater number of the Vaudois from\r\nDauphiny;[110] and there remained only the Italian Vaudois, still\r\nunconquered in spirit, under the leadership of their pastor-general\r\nArnaud, who never appeared greater than in times of difficulty and\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 110: The greater number of them, including Turrel,\r\n         were taken prisoners and shot, or sent to the galleys, where\r\n         they died. This last was the fate of Turrel.]\r\n\r\nWith his diminished forces, and the increasing numbers of the enemy,\r\nArnaud found it impossible to hold both the valleys, as intended;\r\nbesides, winter was approaching, and the men must think of shelter and\r\nprovisions during that season, if resistance was to be prolonged. It\r\nwas accordingly determined to concentrate their little force upon the\r\nBalsille, and all haste was made to reach that stronghold without\r\nfurther delay. Their knowledge of the mountain heights and passes\r\nenabled them to evade their enemies, who were watching for them along\r\nthe valleys, and they passed from the heights of Rodoret to the\r\nsummit of the Balsille by night, before it was known that they were in\r\nthe neighbourhood. They immediately set to work to throw up\r\nentrenchments and erect barricades, so as to render the place as\r\nsecure as possible. Foraging parties were sent out for provisions, to\r\nlay in for the winter, and they returned laden with corn from the\r\nvalley of Pragelas. At the little hamlet of Balsille they repaired the\r\nmill, and set it a-going, the rivulet which flowed down from the\r\nmountain supplying abundance of water-power.\r\n\r\nIt was at the end of October that the little band of heroes took\r\npossession of the Balsille, and they held it firmly all through the\r\nwinter. For more than six months they beat back every force that was\r\nsent against them. The first attack was made by the Marquis\r\nd'Ombrailles at the head of a French detachment; but though the enemy\r\nreached the village of Balsille, they were compelled to retire, partly\r\nby the bullets of the defenders, and partly by the snow, which was\r\nfalling heavily. The Marquis de Parelles next advanced, and summoned\r\nthe Vaudois to surrender; but in vain. \"Our storms are still louder\r\nthan your cannon,\" replied Arnaud, \"and yet our rocks are not shaken.\"\r\nWinter having set in, the besiegers refrained for a time from further\r\nattacks, but strictly guarded all the passes leading to the fortress;\r\nwhile the garrison, availing themselves of their knowledge of the\r\nlocality, made frequent sorties into the adjoining valleys, as well as\r\ninto those of Dauphiny, for the purpose of collecting provisions, in\r\nwhich they were usually successful.\r\n\r\nWhen the fine weather arrived, suitable for a mountain campaign, the\r\nFrench general, Catinat, assembled a strong force, and marched into\r\nthe valley, determined to make short work of this little nest of\r\nbandits on the Balsille. On Sunday morning, the 30th of April, 1690,\r\nwhile Arnaud was preaching to his flock, the sentinels on the look-out\r\ndiscovered the enemy's forces swarming up the valley. Soon other\r\nbodies were seen approaching by the Col du Pis and the Col du Clapier,\r\nwhile a French regiment, supported by the Savoyard militia, climbed\r\nMont Guinevert, and cut off all retreat in that quarter. In short, the\r\nBalsille was completely invested.\r\n\r\nA general assault was made on the position on the 2nd of May, under\r\nthe direction of General Catinat in person. Three French regiments,\r\nsupported by a regiment of dragoons, opened the attack in front;\r\nColonel de Parat, who commanded the leading regiment, saying to his\r\nsoldiers as they advanced, \"My friends, we must sleep to-night in that\r\nbarrack,\" pointing to the rude Vaudois fort on the summit of the\r\nBalsille. They advanced with great bravery; but the barricade could\r\nnot be surmounted, while they were assailed by a perfect storm of\r\nbullets from the defenders, securely posted above.\r\n\r\nCatinat next ordered the troops stationed on the Guinevert to advance\r\nfrom that direction, so as to carry the position from behind. But the\r\nassailants found unexpected intrenchments in their way, from behind\r\nwhich the Vaudois maintained a heavy fire, that eventually drove them\r\nback, their retreat being accelerated by a shower of stones and a\r\nblinding fall of snow and hail. In the meantime, the attack on the\r\nbastion in front continued, and the Vaudois, seeing the French troops\r\nfalling back in disorder, made a vigorous sortie, and destroyed the\r\nwhole remaining force, excepting fifteen men, who fled, bare-headed\r\nand without arms, and carried to the camp the news of their total\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\nA Savoyard officer thus briefly described the issue of the disastrous\r\naffair in a letter to a friend: \"I have only time to tell you that the\r\nFrench have failed in their attack on the Balsille, and they have been\r\nobliged to retire after having lost one hundred and fifty soldiers,\r\nthree captains, besides subalterns and wounded, including a colonel\r\nand a lieutenant-colonel who have been made prisoners, with the two\r\nsergeants who remained behind to help them. The lieutenant-colonel was\r\nsurprised at finding in the fort some nineteen or twenty officers in\r\ngold and silver lace, who treated him as a prisoner of war and very\r\nhumanely, even allowing him to go in search of the surgeon-major of\r\nhis regiment for the purpose of bringing him into the place, and doing\r\nall that was necessary.\"\r\n\r\nCatinat did not choose again to renew the attack in person, or to\r\nendanger his reputation by a further defeat at the hands of men whom\r\nhe had described as a nest of paltry bandits, but entrusted the\r\ndirection of further operations to the Marquis de Féuquières, who had\r\nhis laurels still to win, while Catinat had his to lose. The Balsille\r\nwas again completely invested by the 12th of May, according to the\r\nscheme of operations prepared by Catinat, and the Marquis received by\r\nanticipation the title of \"Conqueror of the Barbets.\" The entire\r\nmountain was surrounded, all the passes were strongly guarded, guns\r\nwere planted in positions which commanded the Vaudois fort, more\r\nparticularly on the Guinevert; and the capture or extermination of the\r\nVaudois was now regarded as a matter of certainty. The attacking army\r\nwas divided into five corps. Each soldier was accompanied by a pioneer\r\ncarrying a fascine, in order to form a cover against the Vaudois\r\nbullets as they advanced.\r\n\r\nSeveral days elapsed before all the preliminaries for the grand attack\r\nwere completed, and then the Marquis ordered a white flag to be\r\nhoisted, and a messenger was sent forward, inviting a parley with the\r\ndefenders of the Balsille. The envoy was asked what he wanted. \"Your\r\nimmediate surrender!\" was the reply. \"You shall each of you receive\r\nfive hundred louis d'or, and good passports for your retirement to a\r\nforeign country; but if you resist, you will be infallibly destroyed.\"\r\n\"That is as the Lord shall will,\" replied the Vaudois messenger.\r\n\r\nThe defenders refused to capitulate on any terms. The Marquis himself\r\nthen wrote to the Vaudois, offering them terms on the above basis, but\r\nthreatening, in case of refusal, that every man of them would be hung.\r\nArnaud's reply was heroic. \"We are not subjects,\" he said, \"of the\r\nKing of France; and that monarch not being master of this country, we\r\ncan enter into no treaty with his servants. We are in the heritage\r\nwhich our fathers have left to us, and we hope, with the help of the\r\nGod of armies, to live and die in it, even though there may remain\r\nonly ten of us to defend it.\" That same night the Vaudois made a\r\nvigorous sortie, and killed a number of the besiegers: this was their\r\nfinal answer to the summons to surrender.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of May the battery on Mont Guinevert was opened, and the\r\nenemy's cannon began to play upon the little fort and bastions, which,\r\nbeing only of dry stones, were soon dismantled. The assault was then\r\nmade simultaneously on three sides; and after a stout resistance, the\r\nVaudois retired from their lower intrenchments, and retreated to\r\nthose on the higher ledges of the mountain. They continued their\r\nresistance until night, and then, taking counsel together, and feeling\r\nthat the place was no longer defensible in the face of so overpowering\r\na force, commanded, as it was, at the same time by the cannon on the\r\nadjoining heights, they determined to evacuate the Balsille, after\r\nholding it for a period of nearly seven months.\r\n\r\nA thick mist having risen up from the valley, the Vaudois set out,\r\nlate at night, under the guidance of Captain Poulat, a native of the\r\ndistrict, who well knew the paths in the mountains. They climbed up on\r\nto the heights above, over icy slopes, passing across gaping crevices\r\nand along almost perpendicular rocks, admitting of their passage only\r\nin single file, sometimes dragging themselves along on their bellies,\r\nclinging to the rocks or to the tufts of grass, occasionally resting\r\nand praying, but never despairing. At length they succeeded, after a\r\nlong détour of the mountain crests, in gaining the northern slope of\r\nGuinevert. Here they came upon and surprised the enemy's outpost,\r\nwhich fled towards the main body; and the Vaudois passed on, panting\r\nand half dead with fatigue. When the morning broke, and the French\r\nproceeded to penetrate the last redoubt on the Balsille, lo, it was\r\nempty! The defenders had abandoned it, and they could scarcely believe\r\ntheir eyes when they saw the dangerous mountain escarpment by which\r\nthey had escaped in the night. Looking across the valley, far off,\r\nthey saw the fugitives, thrown into relief by the snow amidst which\r\nthey marched, like a line of ants, apparently making for the mass of\r\nthe central Alps.\r\n\r\nFor three days they wandered from place to place, gradually moving\r\nsouthwards, their object now being to take up their position at the\r\nPra du Tour, the ancient fortress of the Barbas in the valley of\r\nAngrogna. Before, however, they could reach this stronghold, and while\r\nthey were still at Pramol in the valley of Perosa, news of the most\r\nunexpected kind reached them, which opened up the prospect of their\r\ndeliverance. The news was no other than this--Savoy had declared war\r\nagainst France!\r\n\r\nA rupture between the two powers had for some time been imminent.\r\nLouis XIV. had become more and more exacting in his demands on the\r\nDuke of Savoy, until the latter felt himself in a position of\r\noppressive vassalage. Louis had even intimated his intention of\r\noccupying Verrua and the citadel of Turin; and the Duke, having\r\npreviously ascertained through his cousin, Prince Eugène, the\r\nwillingness of the Emperor of Austria, pressed by William of Orange,\r\nto assist him in opposing the pretensions of France, he at length took\r\nup his stand and declared war against Louis.\r\n\r\nThe Vaudois were now a power in the state, and both parties alike\r\nappealed to them for help, promising them great favours. But the\r\nVaudois, notwithstanding the treachery and cruelty of successive Dukes\r\nof Savoy, were true to their native prince. They pledged themselves to\r\nhold the valleys and defend the mountain passes against France.\r\n\r\nIn the first engagements which took place between the French and the\r\nPiedmontese, the latter were overpowered, and the Duke became a\r\nfugitive. Where did he find refuge? In the valleys of the Vaudois, in\r\na secluded spot in the village of Rora, behind the Pelice, he found a\r\nsafe asylum amidst the people whose fathers he had hunted, proscribed,\r\nand condemned to death.\r\n\r\nBut the tide of war turned, and the French were eventually driven out\r\nof Piedmont. Many of the Vaudois, who had settled in Brandenburg,\r\nHolland, and Switzerland, returned and settled in the valleys; and\r\nthough the Dukes of Savoy, with their accustomed treachery, more than\r\nonce allowed persecution to recommence, their descendants continue to\r\nenjoy the land, and to worship after the manner of their fathers down\r\nto the present day.\r\n\r\nThe Vaudois long laboured under disabilities, and continued to be\r\ndeprived of many social and civil rights. But they patiently bided\r\ntheir time; and the time at length arrived. In 1848 their emancipation\r\nwas one of the great questions of North Italy. It was taken up and\r\nadvocated by the most advanced minds of Piedmont. The petition to\r\nCharles Albert in their favour was in a few days covered with the\r\nnames of its greatest patriots, including those of Balbo, Cavour, and\r\nD'Azeglio. Their emancipation was at length granted, and the Vaudois\r\nnow enjoy the same rights and liberties as the other subjects of\r\nVictor Emanuel.\r\n\r\nNor is the Vaudois Church any longer confined to the valleys, but it\r\nhas become extended of late years all over Italy--to Milan, Florence,\r\nBrescia, Verona, Genoa, Leghorn, Naples, Palermo, Cataneo, Venice, and\r\neven to Rome itself. In most of these places there are day-schools and\r\nSunday-schools, besides churches. The new church at Venice, held in\r\nthe Cavagnis palace, seems to have proved especially successful, the\r\nSunday services being regularly attended by from three to four hundred\r\npersons; while the day-schools in connection with the churches at\r\nTurin, Leghorn, Naples, and Cataneo have proved very successful.\r\n\r\nThus, in the course of a few years, thirty-three Vaudois churches and\r\nstations, with about an equal number of schools, have been established\r\nin various parts of Italy. The missionaries report that the greatest\r\ndifficulties they have to encounter arise from the incredulity and\r\nindifference which are the natural heritage of the Romish Church; but\r\nthat, nevertheless, the work makes satisfactory progress--the good\r\nseed is being planted, and will yet bring forth its increase in God's\r\ndue time.\r\n\r\nFinally, it cannot but be acknowledged that the people of the valleys,\r\nin so tenaciously and conscientiously adhering to their faith, through\r\ngood and through evil, during so many hundred years, have set a\r\nglorious example to Piedmont, and have possibly been in no small\r\ndegree instrumental in establishing the reign of right and of liberty\r\nin Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aiguesmortes, Huguenot prison at, 193, 273, 300.\r\n  Albigenses, 75.\r\n  Anabaptists of Munster, 282-3.\r\n  Anduze, visit to, 125.\r\n  Angrogna, valley of, 481;\r\n    fighting in, 481-86, 498.\r\n  Arnaud, Henry, 215, 512;\r\n    leads back the Vaudois, 503-15;\r\n    defends the Balsille, 515-19.\r\n  Athlone, siege of, 349-50, 355-8.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Balsille, the, 510;\r\n    defence of, 515-19;\r\n    given up, 519.\r\n  Baridon, Etienne, 442-3.\r\n  Barillon, M. de, 323, 330-1.\r\n  Baville on the Protestants of Languedoc, 77, 86;\r\n    occupies the Cevennes, 87;\r\n    at Pont-de-Montvert, 92.\r\n  Beauval, Basnage de, 364.\r\n  Beauvau, Prince de, 273-4.\r\n  Beckwith, General, 478.\r\n  Berwick, Duke of, 310-11, 333, 351.\r\n  Bibles, destruction and scarcity of, 215-16.\r\n  Boileau, General, 351-2.\r\n  Bonnafoux repulsed by Camisards, 142.\r\n  Book-burning, 215, 235-6.\r\n  Bordeille, Raphaël, 318.\r\n  Bourg d'Oisans, 409-10.\r\n  Boyne, battle of the, 341-7.\r\n  Briançon, 414-16.\r\n  Briset, Lieut., death of, 335.\r\n  Broglie, Count, 143-4, 148;\r\n    superseded, 149.\r\n  Brousson, Claude, 30;\r\n    advocate for Protestant church at Nismes, 31;\r\n    meeting in house of, 34;\r\n    petition by, 35;\r\n    escape from Nismes, 42;\r\n    at Lausanne, 43, 46;\r\n    at Berlin, 44;\r\n    in the Cevennes, 50-2, 54;\r\n    reward offered for, 56; at Nismes, 57;\r\n    preaching of, 58-9;\r\n    to Lausanne, England, and Holland, 61-2;\r\n    at Sedan, 64;\r\n    through France, 66-7;\r\n    portraiture of, 68 (note);\r\n    to Nismes again, 69;\r\n    taken, tried, and executed, 70-3.\r\n  Browne, Col.
