GLAZEBROOK, K.C.B., D.Sc., F.R.S.\r\n\r\n       _Past President of the Institute of Electrical Engineers\r\n        and late Director of the National Physical Laboratory_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis splendid volume has a tragic story. Dedicated to Lord Kelvin,\r\nit opens with an introduction by Silvanus Thompson and a preface by\r\nthe distinguished author who himself passed from us before the book\r\ncontaining the fruit of many years of toil was ready for issue.\r\n\r\nAnd what toil! A Bibliographical History of Electricity and Magnetism\r\ncovering 4458 years, from 2637 B.C., when Hoang-Ti, Emperor\r\nof China, is said to have directed the pursuit of his troops after a\r\nrebellious subject by the aid of the compass, up to Christmas Day,\r\nA.D. 1821, when Faraday first caused a wire carrying a current\r\nto rotate in a magnetic field.\r\n\r\nThe early centuries are passed over quickly. Homer’s name occurs with\r\nquotations from the _Odyssey_:\r\n\r\n    “In wondrous ships self-mov’d, instinct with mind,\r\n    No helm secures their course, no pilot guides;\r\n    Like men intelligent, they plough the tides.”\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that the Greeks knew of the compass? The author is\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nThales, 600–580 B.C., the discoverer of frictional electricity,\r\nfollows. The Crusaders wrote of the magnet. A facsimile page is given\r\nof Vincent de Beauvais’ _Speculum Naturale_, and Gauthier d’Espinois,\r\nwho lived about A.D. 1250, sang to his mistress:\r\n\r\n    “Tout autresi (ainsi) comme l’aimant deçoit (detourne)\r\n    L’aigulette pas force de vertu\r\n    A ma dame tot le mont (monde) retennue\r\n    Qui sa beauté connoit et aperçoit.”\r\n\r\nAnd when one passes to more recent years, there is not a name one knows\r\nomitted from the list. There are also many included who all contributed\r\nin some way to the growth of natural knowledge, but who can only be\r\nknown to the few, the very few, who have burrowed in past records\r\nscattered far and wide with the perseverance, the patience, and the\r\nskill of Dr. Mottelay.\r\n\r\nAnd he has discovered interesting facts without number, and at the same\r\ntime has supported his case with full references to original works. To\r\nthe question, How can I find out what--some unknown writer--has written\r\nabout Electricity? there can in future be but one answer: Look him\r\nup in Dr. Mottelay’s _Bibliographical History_. Our debt to the\r\nauthor is no small one; our regrets that he is not here to be gratified\r\nby the reception his book must meet with are deep and sincere.\r\n\r\nThe Great War delayed the issue of the book. The public are indebted\r\nto Messrs. C. Griffin & Co., Ltd., for bringing out a work of the kind\r\nunder the difficulties which all scientific publications have met with\r\nsince 1918, and Dr. Mottelay realized to the full the value of the\r\nassistance they gave him. I trust with confidence that electricians\r\nthroughout the world (for the interest of the book is world-wide) will\r\nnot be slow to show their appreciation of the work of all those who\r\nhave combined to render them so marked a service.\r\n\r\n                                                    R. T. GLAZEBROOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  TO\r\n                          THE REVERED MEMORY\r\n                                  OF\r\n                              LORD KELVIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present work is the definitive edition of my “Chronological History\r\nof Magnetism, Electricity and the Telegraph,” which had tentative\r\npublication (1891–1892) serially in four leading technological\r\nJournals, viz. “Engineering” of London, “The Electrical World” of New\r\nYork, “La Lumière Electrique” of Paris, and “L’Industrie Moderne” of\r\nBrussels.\r\n\r\nSince the time of that first publication, it has received a most\r\nthorough revision of the original text, for correction of faults of\r\nform, or of substance, suggested by learned critics conversant with the\r\nhistory of electricity and magnetism; and there have been added a very\r\nlarge number of new entries besides exhaustive notices of the work done\r\nby Peregrinus, Gilbert, Oersted, Faraday and other great pathfinders,\r\nalso biographical and bibliographical notices of all the prominent\r\nancient writers mentioned in the original compilation.\r\n\r\nThis bibliography commences B.C. 2637--conclusively shown\r\nto be the earliest date at which history notes anything resembling\r\nthe application of the magnetic influence--and it ends with Michael\r\nFaraday, esteemed by Tyndall to be “the greatest experimental\r\nphilosopher the world has ever seen,” and who is held “to have\r\ndone more for the development of electrical science than any other\r\ninvestigator.” Thus is the chronological series shown to cover 4458\r\nyears, being purposely made to terminate at A.D. 1820–1821\r\n(Oersted, Ampère, Arago, Faraday, etc.), the culminating period when,\r\nthrough the splendid discovery of electro-magnetism, the two immense\r\ngroups of phenomena were first linked together.\r\n\r\nBesides the matter distinctly involved in the title of the new work,\r\nit has been deemed advisable to note in this History all the most\r\nimportant forms of the optical telegraph, or semeiograph. Many of the\r\nancient and historical methods for communicating intelligence swiftly\r\nat great distances are noticed in their chronological order: doubtless,\r\nthis will prove to the generality of readers no less interesting than\r\nthe vast multitude of curious facts pertaining to the direct line of\r\nresearches. An exhaustive cross-entry Index of Selected Names and\r\nSubjects, embracing fuller titles and much additional data that could\r\nnot well be entered into the body of the work, will, for the first\r\ntime, make this mass of historical data readily accessible.\r\n\r\nTo bar controversies and partisan discussion as to the relative\r\nmerits of different discoverers and inventors, concerning which\r\nauthorities are at variance, it has been thought best to quote all\r\nof the weightiest known authorities under the respective heads and\r\ndates of the several claimants. To the would-be historian and to the\r\ndelving student, this will certainly appear the better course. A case\r\nin point, and it is no uncommon one, attaches to the invention of the\r\nmariner’s compass, where that instrument and its original employment in\r\nnavigation are credited with equal assurance to China, Iceland, France,\r\nEngland and Italy, by equally eminent historians and scientists. And,\r\nas nearly all, except the very earliest, discoveries of any high\r\nimportance have already been traced to their respective origins by many\r\nauthors, additional data have been gathered and quoted wherever such\r\ndata seemed deserving of more than the ordinary notices previously\r\naccorded them in print, or where the peculiar nature of the discovery,\r\nor the identity of its author, merited authentication to preclude doubt\r\nor controversy.\r\n\r\nThe unusual number of cumulative references purposely given throughout\r\nmany entries (the most important of which were originally set in\r\nitalics) cannot be seriously objected to, as they afford ready means\r\nfor making searches through different accessible channels, covering\r\nvarious phases of a subject, and they facilitate the verification of\r\nall extracts and of all quoted passages. They likewise effectually\r\noffset the likelihood of misprints necessarily attaching to many of\r\nthe authorities which are cited from, and which often can be found\r\nsolely in, rare early publications or in more or less unintelligible\r\nmanuscripts. Only those who have had to make important searches through\r\nsuch can appreciate the difficulties which continually beset the\r\ninvestigator. Many of the older serials likewise prove quite unreliable\r\nand disappointing, either through wrong pagination or irregular and\r\nsometimes conflicting dates of publication, as well as through the\r\nrearrangement or redistribution of parts or series, at various periods\r\nand in different volumes. This is the case, more particularly, with “Le\r\nJournal des Savants” and with “The Philosophical Transactions,” as it\r\nis also with many technical serial publications of various countries\r\nwhich are referred to in the following pages.\r\n\r\nIn the Preface to his “Experimental Researches,” the great Faraday\r\njustly remarked that: “The date of a scientific paper containing any\r\npretensions to discovery is frequently a matter of serious importance,\r\nand it is a great misfortune that there are many most valuable\r\ncommunications, essential to the history and progress of science, with\r\nrespect to which this point cannot now be ascertained. This arises\r\nfrom the circumstance of the papers having no dates attached to them\r\nindividually, and of the Journals in which they appear having such as\r\nare inaccurate, _i. e._ dates of a period earlier than that of\r\npublication.”\r\n\r\nOf the afore-named serials, the very important “Philosophical\r\nTransactions” have doubtless been most frequently alluded to herein,\r\nboth in their original and abridged forms, and, for that reason, the\r\nassistance of representatives of the Royal Society has been sought in\r\norder to give a proper account to date, showing the difficulties which\r\nhave throughout been encountered by its many successive editors. It\r\nwill be seen, at pages 546–547, that there were numerous irregularities\r\nin the publication of the unabridged series from the initial date of\r\n1665, only seven numbers having been issued from 1679 to 1682, whilst\r\nneither numbers nor volumes appeared between 1688 and 1690, and that,\r\nthrough lax editing, various numbers were often, during subsequent\r\nyears, assigned to volumes differently designated. In the many abridged\r\nreports, irregularities are still greater, as shown at pages 547–548.\r\nDuring 1721, Motte edited “an abridgment, 1700–1720, in three volumes\r\nwhich was very incorrect” (“Dict. Nat. Biog.,” Vol. XXXIX. p. 194).\r\nThe six volumes of 1720–1732 also appeared in two volumes, published\r\n1733. The two volumes of 1719–1733 contained an “Index to the previous\r\nseven volumes” by different authors. This was made up by John Martyn,\r\nwho published in five volumes an abridgment of the Transactions for\r\n1719–1750, which he had previously issued in three sets of two volumes\r\neach. Mr. Samuel H. Scudder’s remarks as to various discrepancies are\r\nworthy of notice. He says (“Cat. of Scient. Serials,” 1879, p. 27) that\r\n“the Philosophical Transactions Abridged have been very irregularly\r\nissued. The first five volumes went through several editions (from\r\nfive to two, according to the volume) between 1705 and 1781; the\r\nlater volumes through only one, 1734–1756.” He adds: “There is a\r\nstrange discrepancy here, the fourth edition of the first volume being\r\nsometimes dated 1731, sometimes 1781, and sometimes 1782, whilst the\r\nfifth edition of volumes one to three is dated 1749; the eighth volume\r\nis again sometimes dated 1734, sometimes 1747.”\r\n\r\nWere I to indite an _apologia_ for the present work, I could\r\nnot hope to express it more happily than does Mr. J. J. Fahie in the\r\npreface to his “History of Wireless Telegraphy, 1838–1899”; or, I might\r\nadopt the words of two of the most learned French authors of the day:\r\n\r\n“Si je donne ces détails, nouveaux, ou peu connus, c’est qu’il est\r\ntoujours intéressant de remonter à l’origine et au développement\r\nsuccessif des inventions.” (M. Berthelot, in the “Comptes Rendus.”)\r\n\r\n“S’il n’y a pas beaucoup de gens qu’elles intéressent, il y en a\r\nqu’elles intéressent beaucoup. À ceux-ci, nous avons, en rédigeant ces\r\nnotes, eu l’intention et l’espérance de venir quelquefois en aide. Tout\r\ncatalogue a des points obscurs, même les meilleurs.... L’office propre,\r\nle devoir de la critique, est de rechercher si ces points obscurs ne\r\npourraient pas être éclairés par quelque lumière. Il est vrai qu’elle\r\ny perd souvent sa peine. Mais cela ne doît jamais la décourager.” (M.\r\nHauréau, in “Le Journal des Savants.”)\r\n\r\nI am especially thankful for the warm encouragement which I have\r\nreceived, on all sides, since the original work appeared in serial\r\nform. This History has been frequently called for, and I regret that\r\nI have been hitherto prevented from bringing it out earlier in its\r\npresent desirable book form. This is the more to be regretted as it\r\nlong ago received the practical endorsement of the _doyen_ of\r\nthe electrical profession, Lord Kelvin (formerly styled Sir William\r\nThomson), to whom it is dedicated. Leave to do this was obtained\r\nthrough a mutual friend in such a cordial manner that I cannot refrain\r\nfrom giving the correspondence attaching thereto:\r\n\r\n                                             _Westminster Chambers,\r\n                                                 London, S.W.,\r\n                                                    January 4, 1894._\r\n\r\n    “DEAR MOTTELAY,\r\n\r\n   “I duly received yours of the 21st ... but the point on which\r\n   I feel guilty is your _dedication_....

Thompson,\r\nD.Sc., F.R.S., for the interest he has throughout manifested in, and\r\nthe material aid he has given to, the improvement and development of\r\nthe present work. Especial acknowledgment is made of Dr. Thompson’s\r\npersonal revision of the articles on Petrus Peregrinus (at A.D. 1269),\r\non William Gilbert (at A.D. 1600), and on Michael Faraday (at A.D.\r\n1821). With all of these authors, he has become very prominently\r\nidentified through the several special publications concerning them,\r\nwhich have been issued by him at different periods, and all of which\r\nare herein noticed in their proper order.\r\n\r\nThanks are likewise due, and are also by me hereby tendered, more\r\nparticularly to Dr. Elihu Thomson, of the Massachusetts Institute\r\nof Technology; to Dr. J. A. Fleming, M.A., F.R.S.; to Mr. W. D.\r\nWeaver, late Editor of the “Electrical World”; to Mr. Wm. J. Hammer,\r\nrepresentative of Mr. Thomas A. Edison; to Mr. A. Hastings White,\r\nassistant-librarian, Royal Society, London; to Messrs. Charles Spon\r\nand Louis H.

Parshall,\r\nfor many valuable suggestions and other aid given by all of them at\r\ndifferent periods to the material benefit of this compilation.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary adding that, notwithstanding the great care\r\ngiven to the preparation of this very extensive Bibliography, and\r\nto its difficult “proof” reading, errors will undoubtedly present\r\nthemselves. It is, however, hoped these will not prove of material\r\nimportance. Such mistakes as are of a typographical nature can easily\r\nbe recognized and in due time remedied; those, however, resulting from\r\nthe conflict of authorities are more difficult to trace, and I shall\r\ngreatly appreciate their being pointed out to me, with the view to\r\nimproving future editions.\r\n\r\n                                                  P. FLEURY MOTTELAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone who enters on the perilous paths of Bibliography realizes,\r\nsooner or later, the truth that “of the making of books there is no\r\nend.” But there was a beginning: and if the Bibliography of Electricity\r\npromises to stretch onward into the future in endless line, at least\r\nits backward reach might seem to be finite in date. Nevertheless, the\r\nstudent of the early periods of book production, when the science of\r\nelectricity was literally in that “infancy” from which in our time it\r\nhas emerged, is continually finding that there are early works of which\r\nhe was unaware, and of which even our best libraries are destitute.\r\nHe finds, as he progresses backward, toward the origins of things, in\r\nhow many points our ancestors in the domain of electric science had\r\nanticipated the discoveries of later date. He finds that, again and\r\nagain, by some rare stroke of insight, the great minds that had devoted\r\nthemselves to the research of phenomena had seen--it may be, with dim\r\nor imperfect glimpses--many of the things which are commonly regarded\r\nas quite modern. The pioneer, unbiased by the views of contemporary\r\nphilosophers, unhampered by the load of textbook tradition, often sees\r\nfurther than the professed researcher who comes after him.\r\n\r\nThe art of scientific discovery--for it is an art--can be attained in\r\nbut one way, the way of attainment in all arts, namely, by practising\r\nit. In the practice of art, the aspirant may at least learn something\r\nthat all the textbooks cannot drill out of him, and which will help him\r\nin his practice, by the careful examination of the actual ways in which\r\nthe discoveries of science, now facts of history, were actually made.\r\nBut, to do this, he must throw overboard for a time the systematic\r\ntextbooks, he must abandon the logical expositions which embody, at\r\nsecond hand, or at third hand, the antecedent discoveries, and he must\r\ngo to the original sources, the writings and records of the discoverers\r\nthemselves, and learn from them how they set to work. The modern\r\ncompendious handbooks in which the results of hundreds of workers have\r\nbeen boiled down, as it were, to a uniform consistency, is exactly the\r\nintellectual pabulum which he must eschew. Let him read Faraday, not\r\nthrough the eyes of Maxwell or of Tyndall, but in his own words in the\r\nimmortal pages of the “Experimental Researches,” with their wealth of\r\npetty detail and their apparent vagueness of speculation. Let him\r\nread Ohm’s own account of the law of the circuit, not some modern\r\nwatered-down version. Let him turn over the pages of Franklin’s letters\r\nto Collinson, as his observations dropped red-hot out of the crucible\r\nof his endeavours. Let him read Stephen Gray’s charming experiments in\r\nthe old-world diction that befitted a pensioner of the Charterhouse.\r\nLet him go back to old Gilbert, who had talked with Drake and Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh in the flesh, who had discussed magnetism with Fra Paolo\r\nSarpi and had experimented on the dip of the needle with Robert Norman.\r\nGilbert’s account of his own experiments is for the would-be scientific\r\ndiscoverer worth a hundredfold the Novum Organon of the overpraised\r\nFrancis Bacon. Nay, let him go back to Peter Peregrinus, the\r\nsoldier-pioneer, and see how he experimented with floating lodestones\r\nbefore he penned his account of the pivoted magnet--the earliest known\r\ninstrument that can rightly be called a mariner’s compass. Not until he\r\nhas thus become a bit of an antiquary will he have fully understood how\r\nthe discoveries of old were made. And, in precisely the same spirit of\r\nquest, though with the wealth of modern appliances at his command, must\r\nhe go to work, if new discoveries are to be made by him.\r\n\r\nBut, for all this, he needs a guide to tell him what are the records\r\nof the original pioneers, by what names their works are called, and\r\nwhere they can be found. Such a guide doubtless exists to some extent\r\nin the mere catalogues of electrical literature, such as the catalogue\r\nof the Ronalds’ Library at the Institution of Electrical Engineers, in\r\nLondon; or, more fully, even, in the new Catalogue of the Latimer Clark\r\nLibrary, now known as the Wheeler Collection, at the American Institute\r\nof Electrical Engineers, in New York. The Chronological History of\r\nElectricity which Mr. P. F. Mottelay contributed, week by week, to the\r\ncolumns of the “Electrical World” and of “Engineering” in the years\r\n1891–1892, was the beginning of an attempt to provide an even more\r\ncomplete analysis of the earlier literature of the subject. But these\r\nare only the beginnings.\r\n\r\nIn the “Bibliographical History of Electricity and Magnetism,” which\r\nMr. Mottelay is now giving to the world, a far more exhaustive and\r\ndetailed account is rendered of the earlier workers and writers in our\r\ndual science. He has particularly worked up all important electrical\r\nchannels, and in the more extended articles, some of which it has\r\nbeen the writer’s privilege to peruse in advance, there are presented\r\nvaluable monographs dealing with particular workers who each in his own\r\nday made notable contributions to the advance of the science.\r\n\r\nTo all who would tread in their paths, and add something to the\r\never-widening domain of electrical discovery, this Bibliographical\r\nHistory may be commended, not only for what it contains, but for the\r\nappreciative spirit in which it brings before the reader the work of\r\nthose men who made the science what it is.\r\n\r\nPioneers; O Pioneers!\r\n\r\n                                                SILVANUS P.

It is related that, during this sixty-first\r\nyear of the reign of Hoang-ti (Yeou-hioung-che, also named Koung-fun\r\nand Hiuen-yuen), the emperor’s troops, who were pursuing the rebellious\r\nprince Tchéyeou (Tchi-yeou), lost their way, as well as the course\r\nof the wind, and likewise the sight of their enemy, during the heavy\r\nfogs prevailing in the plains of Tchou-lou. Seeing which, Hoang-ti\r\nconstructed a chariot upon which stood erect a prominent female figure\r\nwhich indicated the four cardinal points, and which always turned to\r\nthe south whatever might be the direction taken by the chariot. Thus he\r\nsucceeded in capturing the rebellious prince, who was put to death.\r\n\r\nSome say that upon this chariot stood a needle, to denote the four\r\nparts of the world. That, states the French author writing in 1736,\r\nwould “indicate the use of the compass, or something very similar to it\r\n... and it is unfortunate that the device has not been explained more\r\nfully.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Du Halde, “Description de la Chine ...,” La Haye,\r\n   1736.

Mailla (Joseph A. M. de Moyriac de)\r\nin his “Histoire ... traduite du Thoung-Kian-Kang-Mou,” Paris, 1777,\r\nVol. I. p. 28, makes the latter date 2599, as do likewise, Dr. Hœfer\r\n(“Nouvelle Biographie Générale,” Paris, 1858, Vol. XXIV. pp. 817–819)\r\nand Pierre Larousse (“Grand Dict, du XIX^e Siècle,” 1873, Vol. IX. p.\r\n317), but Michaud (“Biogr. Univer.,” 1857, Vol. XIX. pp. 476–477) says\r\nhe reigned from 2698 to 2577 B.C., and, in “La Grande Encyclop.,” Vol.\r\nXX. pp. 157–158, we are told that the correct period is 2697–2597 B.C.\r\n(“L’art de vérifier les dates,” Paris, 1819, Vol. IV. p. 8).\r\n\r\nThe above-named work of Jean Baptiste Du Halde on China is considered\r\nthe most complete account of that vast empire that has appeared in\r\nEurope (“New Gen. Biogr. Dict.,” London, 1850, Vol. VIII. p. 175). In\r\nany case, remarks Mr. Demetrius C. Boulger (“History of China,” London,\r\n1881, Vol. I. pp. 4–5), it is incontestable that the individuality of\r\nHoang-ti, who was the successor of “Fo-hi,” the first great Chinese\r\nemperor, is much more tangible than that of any of his predecessors.[1]\r\nBy him, it is well recorded that the extensive Chinese territory\r\n(Empire) was divided into ten provinces, or _Chow_, each of which was\r\nsubdivided into ten departments, or _Tsee_, and these again into ten\r\ndistricts, or _Tou_, each of them containing ten towns, or _Ye_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=B.C. 1110.=--Tcheou-Koung is said to have at this date taught the\r\nuse of the needle compass to the envoys from Youa-tchang. “As the\r\nambassadors sent from Cochin China and Tonquin” (Humboldt, “Cosmos”\r\nVol. V. p. 51) “were about to take their departure” (which was in\r\nthe twenty-second cycle, more than 1040 years B.C.), “Tcheou-Koung\r\ngave them an instrument which upon one side always turned toward the\r\nnorth and on the opposite side to the south, the better to direct them\r\nupon their homeward voyage.[2] This instrument was called _tchi-nan_\r\n(chariot of the south), and it is still the name given to the compass,\r\nwhich leads to the belief that Tcheou-Koung invented the latter.” In\r\nhis chapter on “The Magnetic Needle,” Humboldt says the apparatus was\r\ncalled _fse-nan_ (indicator of the south).\r\n\r\nTcheou-Koung (Ki-tan) was Chinese Minister of State under both Von-Vang\r\n(the first emperor of the Tcheou dynasty, who ruled seven years) and\r\nTsching-Vang (second emperor, who ruled thirty-seven years), and lived\r\nto be 100 years old. He was one of the most learned and most popular\r\nmen China has ever known, and is spoken of to this day by the Chinese\r\n“with an admiration bordering upon enthusiasm” (Saillant et Nyon,\r\n“Mémoires concernant l’Histoire,” Paris, 1776, Vol. III. p. 37). The\r\nemperor Tsching-Vang caused Tcheou-Koung’s body to be interred near his\r\nfather’s remains, after giving it imperial funeral honours.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Du Halde, “Description de la Chine ...,” La Haye,\r\n   1736, Vol. I. p. 312; Klaproth, “Boussole,” p. 81; Azuni,\r\n   “Boussole,” pp. 190–191; Humboldt, “Cosmos,” London, 1849, Vol.\r\n   II. p. 628, and Vol. V. p. 52.\r\n\r\n\r\n=B.C. 1084.=--According to Æschylus, the father of the Athenian drama,\r\nAgamemnon employed a line of optical signals to advise his queen\r\nClytemnestra of the fall of Troy. Robert Browning’s translation,\r\nLondon, 1877, runs as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Troia, the Achaioi hold....\r\n    Hephaistos--sending a bright blaze from Idé\r\n    Beacon did beacon send, from fire the poster,\r\n    Hitherward: Idé to the rock Hermaian\r\n    Of Lemnos: and a third great torch o’ the island\r\n    Zeus’ seat received in turn, the Athoan summit.\r\n    And--so upsoaring as to stride sea over,\r\n    The strong lamp-voyager, and all for joyance--\r\n    Did the gold-glorious splendor, any sun like,\r\n    Pass on....”\r\n\r\nAnna Swanwick thus renders Æschylus’ “Agamemnon,” London, 1881, p. 13:\r\n\r\n    “For Priam’s city have the Argives won.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Hephaestos sending forth Idaian fire.\r\n    Hither through swift relays of courier flame....”\r\n\r\nAt page 193 of his “Agamemnon,” London, 1873, E. H. Plumptre refers\r\nto the system of posts or messengers which the Persian kings seem to\r\nhave been first to organize, and which impressed the minds of both the\r\nHebrews (Esther viii. 14) and the Greeks (Herod., viii. 98) by their\r\nregular transmission of the king’s edicts or of special news.\r\n\r\nWhat of the passage from the celebrated patriarch Job (xxxviii. 35):\r\n“Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, ‘Here\r\nwe are?’” (original Hebrew, “Behold us”). As has been remarked, this\r\nseems prophetic, when taken in connection with the electric telegraph.\r\n\r\nThe fire beacons are also alluded to by Plutarch in his Life of Quintus\r\nSertorius; and Mardonius prepared fire signals to notify Xerxes, then\r\nat Sardis, of the second taking of Athens.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Le Théâtre des Grecs,” P.

Humboldt states, besides, that, even in the third century\r\nof our era, Chinese vessels navigated the Indian Ocean under the\r\ndirection of magnetic needles pointing to the south, and that, at\r\npages xxxviii-xlii, Vol. I. of his “Asie Centrale,” he has shown what\r\nadvantages this means of topographical direction, as well as the early\r\nknowledge and application of the magnetic needle, gave the Chinese\r\ngeographers over the Greeks and Romans, to whom, for instance, even\r\nthe true direction of the Pyrenees and the Apennines always remained\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Humboldt, “Cosmos,” London, 1849, Vol. I. p. 173,\r\n   also his “Examen Critique de l’histoire de la Géographie,” Vol.\r\n   III. p. 36; “Mœurs de Reg.

The Spanish Jesuit Pineda and\r\nAthanasius Kircher assert the same, and state that Solomon’s subjects\r\nemployed it in their navigations.

The selections made are as follows:\r\n\r\n    “In wond’rous ships, self-mov’d, instinct with mind;\r\n    No helm secures their course, no pilot guides;\r\n    Like man intelligent, they plough the tides.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Though clouds and darkness veil th’ encumber’d sky,\r\n    Fearless thro’ darkness and thro’ clouds they fly.”\r\n\r\n   Alexander Pope, “The Odyssey of Homer,” London, 1818, p. 135.\r\n\r\n    “...; for here\r\n    In our Phæacian ships no pilots are,\r\n    Nor rudders, as in ships of other lands.\r\n    Ours know the thoughts and the intents of men.\r\n    To them all cities and all fertile coasts\r\n    Inhabited by men are known; they cross\r\n    The great sea scudding fast, involved in mist\r\n    And darkness, with no fear of perishing\r\n    Or meeting harm.”\r\n\r\n   Wm. Cullen Bryant, “The Odyssey of Homer,” Boston, 1875, Vol. I.\r\n   p. 174.\r\n\r\n    “For unto us no pilots appertain,\r\n    Rudder nor helm which other barks obey.\r\n    These ruled by reason, their own course essay\r\n    Sparing men’s mind ...\r\n    Sail in a fearless scorn of scathe or overthrow.”\r\n\r\n   Philip Stanhope Worsley, “The Odyssey of Homer,” London, 1861,\r\n   Vol. I. p. 198.\r\n\r\n    “For all unlike the ships of other men,\r\n    Nor helm nor steersman have our country’s barks,\r\n    But of themselves they know the thoughts of men;\r\n    ... and wrapped in gloom and mist\r\n    O’er the broad ocean gulfs they hold their course\r\n    Fearless of loss and shipwreck....”\r\n\r\n   Earl of Carnarvon, “The Odyssey of Homer,” London, 1886, p. 201.\r\n\r\n   “These marvellous ships, endued with human sense, and\r\n   anticipating the will of their masters, flit unseen over the\r\n   sea.”--“Homer’s Odyssey,” by W.

Ewart Gladstone either in his “Juventus Mundi” or throughout\r\nhis very extensive “Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age.”\r\n\r\nSonnini tells us that as this period is about the same as that of the\r\nChinese chronicles, it can scarcely be doubted that the knowledge of\r\nboth the polarity of the needle and of the use of the compass for\r\nnavigation date back 3000 years (Buffon, “Terre,” Paris, An. VIII. p.\r\n304).\r\n\r\nThis ill accords, however, with the views of others who have concluded,\r\nperhaps rightly, that the Greeks, Romans, Tuscans and Phœnicians[3]\r\nwere ignorant of the directive property of the magnet, from the fact\r\nthat none of the writings, more especially of Theophrastus, Plato,\r\nAristotle, Lucretius and Pliny, make explicit allusion thereto.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Humboldt, “Cosmos,” 1859, Vol. V. p. 51; “Good\r\n   Words,” 1874, p. 70; Brumoy, “Théâtre des Grecs,” 1820, Vol. I.\r\n   p. 55; Pope’s translation of the “Iliad,” 1738, Vol. I. pp. 14,\r\n   20; Schaffner, “Telegraph Manual,” p. 19; also references under\r\n   both the A.D. 121 and the A.D. 265–419 dates.\r\n\r\n\r\n=B.C. 600–580.=--Thales of Miletus, Ionia, one of the “seven wise men\r\nof Greece” (the others being Solon, Chilo, Pittacus, Bias, Cleobolus\r\nand Periander), founder of the Ionic philosophy, and from whose\r\nschool came Socrates, is said to have been the first to observe the\r\nelectricity developed by friction in amber.\r\n\r\nThales, Theophrastus, Solinus, Priscian and Pliny, as well as other\r\nwriters, Greek and Roman, mention the fact that when a vivifying heat\r\nis applied to amber it will attract straws, dried leaves, and other\r\nlight bodies in the same way that a magnet attracts iron (“Photii\r\nBibliotheca” Rothomagi, 1653, folio, col. 1040–1041, cod. 242).\r\n\r\nRobert Boyle (“Philosophical Works,” London, 1738, Vol. I. p. 506, or\r\nLondon, 1744, Vol. III. p. 647) treats of different hypotheses advanced\r\nto solve the phenomena of electrical attraction, saying: “The first\r\nis that of the learned Nicholas Cabaeus (A.D. 1629), who thinks the\r\ndrawing of light bodies by amber ... is caused by the steams which\r\nissue out of such bodies and discuss and expel the neighbouring air\r\n... making small whirlwind.... Another is that of the eminent English\r\nphilosopher, Sir Kenelm Digby (A.D. 1644), and embraced by the very\r\nlearned Dr. Browne (A.D. 1646) and others, who believed that ... chafed\r\namber is made to emit certain rays of unctuous steams, which, when they\r\ncome to be a little cooled by the external air, are somewhat condensed\r\n... carrying back with them those light bodies to which they happen to\r\nadhere at the time of their retraction.... Pierre Gassendi (A.D. 1632)\r\nthinks the same, and adds that these electrical rays ... get into the\r\npores of a straw ... and by means of their decussation take the faster\r\nhold of it ... when they shrink back to the amber whence they were\r\nemitted ... Cartesius (Descartes, A.D. 1644) accounts for electrical\r\nattractions by the intervention of certain particles, shaped almost\r\nlike small pieces of riband, which he supposes to be formed of this\r\nsubtile matter harboured in the pores or crevices of glass.”\r\n\r\nThe ancients were acquainted with but two electrical bodies--amber\r\n(_electron_), which has given the denomination of the science; and\r\n_lyncurium_, which is either the tourmaline or the topaz (Dr. Davy,\r\n“Mem. Sir Humphry Davy,” 1836, Vol. I. p. 309). From a recent article\r\ntreating of gems, the following is extracted: “The name of the precious\r\nstone inserted in the ring of Gyges has not been handed down to us,\r\nbut it is probable that it was the topaz, whose wonders Philostratus\r\nrecounts in the Life of Apollonius. An attribute of the sun and of\r\nfire, the ancients called it the _gold magnet_, as it was credited\r\nwith the power of attracting that metal, indicating its veins, and\r\ndiscovering treasures. Heliodorus, in his story of Theagenes and\r\nCaricles, says that the topaz saves from fire all those who wear it,\r\nand that Caricles was preserved by a topaz from the fiery vengeance of\r\nArsaces, Queen of Ethiopia. This stone was one of the first talismans\r\nthat Theagenes possessed in Egypt. The topaz, at present, symbolizes\r\nChristian virtues--faith, justice, temperance, gentleness, clemency.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Greek Thinkers,” by Theodor Gomperz, translation\r\n   of L.

Pliny even asserts that they\r\nhad a secret method of not only “drawing it (the lightning) down”\r\nfrom the clouds, but of afterwards “turning it aside” in any desired\r\ndirection. They recognized different sources of lightning, those\r\ncoming from the sky (_a sideribus venientia_), which always struck\r\nobliquely, and others from the earth (_infera_, _terrena_), which rose\r\nperpendicularly. The Romans, on the other hand, recognized only two\r\nsorts, those of the day, attributed to Jupiter, and those of the night,\r\nattributed to Summanus (see Vassalli-Eandi at A.D. 1790).\r\n\r\nThis Vassalli-Eandi--like L. Fromondi--made special study of the very\r\nextensive scientific knowledge displayed by the ancients and, as shown\r\nin his “Conghietture ...” he concluded that they really possessed the\r\nsecret of attracting and directing lightning. The above-named extracts\r\nconcerning the Etruscans and Romans are made from the subjoined work of\r\nMme. Blavatsky, wherein the following is likewise given.\r\n\r\nTradition says that Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, was\r\ninitiated by the priests of the Etruscan divinities, and instructed by\r\nthem in the secret of forcing Jupiter, the Thunderer, to descend upon\r\nearth. Salverte believes that before Franklin discovered his refined\r\nelectricity, Numa had experimented with it most successfully, and that\r\nTullus Hostilius, the successor of Numa, was the first victim of the\r\ndangerous “heavenly guest” recorded in history. Salverte remarks that\r\nPliny makes use of expressions which seem to indicate two distinct\r\nprocesses; the one obtained thunder (_impetrare_), the other forced\r\nit to lightning (_cogere_). Tracing back the knowledge of thunder and\r\nlightning possessed by the Etruscan priests, we find that Tarchon,\r\nthe founder of the theurgism of the former, desiring to preserve his\r\nhouse from lightning, surrounded it by a hedge of the white bryony, a\r\nclimbing plant which has the property of averting thunderbolts. The\r\nTemple of Juno had its roofs covered with numerous pointed blades of\r\nswords. Ben David, says the author of “Occult Sciences,” has asserted\r\nthat Moses (born about 1570 B.C.) possessed some knowledge of the\r\nphenomena of electricity. Prof. Hirt, of Berlin, is of this opinion.\r\nMichaelis remarks that there is no indication that lightning ever\r\nstruck the Temple of Jerusalem during a thousand years: that, according\r\nto Josephus, a forest of points, of gold and very sharp, covered the\r\nroof of the temple, and that this roof communicated with the caverns in\r\nthe hill by means of pipes in connection with the gilding which covered\r\nall the exterior of the building, in consequence of which the points\r\nwould act as conductors. Salverte further asserts that in the days of\r\nCtesias--Ktesias--India was acquainted with the use of conductors of\r\nlightning. This historian plainly states that iron placed at the bottom\r\nof a fountain, and made in the form of a sword, with the point upward,\r\npossessed, as soon as it was thus fixed in the ground, the property of\r\naverting storms and lightning.\r\n\r\n“Ancient India, as described by Ktesias, the Knidian,” J. H. McCrindle,\r\nLondon, 1882, alludes, p. 68, to iron swords employed to ward off\r\nlightning. Reference is made to the _pantarbe_ at pp. 7–8, 69–70,\r\nand to the _elektron_ (amber) at pp. 20, 21, 23, 51, 52, 70, 86. See\r\naccount of Ktesias in “Nouvelle Biogr. Génér.,” Vol. XII. pp. 568–571,\r\nand in “Larousse Dict.,” Vol. V. p. 614.\r\n\r\nIn his “Observations sur la Physique,” Vols. XXIV. pp. 321–323,\r\nXXV. pp. 297–303, XXVI. pp. 101–107, M. l’Abbé Rosier gives the\r\ncorrespondence between M. de Michaelis, Professor at Göttingen, and Mr.\r\nLichtenberg, showing conclusively how the numerous points distributed\r\nover the surface of the roof of the Temple of Solomon effectively\r\nserved as lightning conductors. Mr. Lichtenberg in addition shows that\r\nthe bell tower located upon a hill at the country seat of Count Orsini\r\nde Rosenberg, was, during a period of several years, so repeatedly\r\nstruck by lightning, with great loss of life, that divine service had\r\nto be suspended in the church. The tower was entirely destroyed in 1730\r\nand soon after rebuilt, but it was struck as often as ten times during\r\none prolonged storm, until finally a fifth successive attack, during\r\nthe year 1778, compelled its demolition. For the third time the tower\r\nwas reconstructed, and the Count placed a pointed conductor, since\r\nwhich time no damage has been sustained.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Mme.

B. Randolph, at p. 48) quotes\r\nan instance, which, being merely given on his own authority, and he\r\nseeming uncertain whether the story comes from Macrinus or some other\r\nwriter, may be taken for what it is worth. He found good evidence, he\r\nsays, during his stay in Egypt, that one of the Cleopatras actually\r\nsent news by a wire to all of the cities from Heliopolis (the\r\nmagnificent chief seat of sun-worship) to the island of Elephantine, on\r\nthe Upper Nile.\r\n\r\nFurther on, Mme. Blavatsky thus alludes to the loadstone:\r\n\r\n“The stone magnet is believed by many to owe its name to Magnesia....”\r\nWe consider, however, the opinion of the Hermetists to be the correct\r\none. The word _magh_, _magus_, is derived from the Sanscrit _mahaji_,\r\nmeaning the great or wise ... so the magnet stone was called in honour\r\nof the Magi, who were the first to discover its wonderful properties.\r\nTheir places of worship were located throughout the country in all\r\ndirections, and among these were some temples of Hercules, hence\r\nthe stone--when it became known that the priests used it for their\r\ncurative and magical purposes--received the name of Magnesian or\r\nHerculean stone. Socrates, speaking of it, says: “Euripides calls it\r\nthe Magnesian stone, but the common people the Herculean” (Plato,\r\n“Ion”--Burgess--Vol. IV. p. 294). In the same Vol. I. of “Isis\r\nUnveiled” we are likewise informed that Electricity in the Norse\r\nlegends is personated by Thor, the son of Odin, at Samothrace by the\r\nKabeirian Demeter (Joseph Ennemoser, “History of Magic,” London,\r\n1854, Vol. II.; J. S. C. Schweigger, “Introd. to Mythol. through Nat\r\nHist.,” Halle, 1836), and that it is denoted by the “twin brothers,”\r\nthe Dioskuri. Also that the _celestial_, pure fire of the Pagan altar\r\nwas electrically drawn from the astral light, that magnetic currents\r\ndevelop themselves into electricity upon their exit from the body, and\r\nthat the first inhabitants of the earth brought down the heavenly fire\r\nto their altars (J. S. C. Schweigger in Ennemoser’s “Hist. of Magic,”\r\nVol. II. p. 30; Maurus Honoratus Servius, “Virgil,” Eclog. VI. v. 42).\r\n\r\n\r\n=B.C. 321.=--Theophrastus, Greek philosopher, first observed the\r\nattractive property of the _lyncurium_, supposed by many to be the\r\n_tourmaline_, and gave a description of it in his treatise upon stones\r\n(“De Lapidibus,” sec. 53; or the translation of Sir John Hill, 1774,\r\nchap. xlix.-l., p. 123). This crystal was termed _lapis lyncurius_ by\r\nPliny in his “Nat. Hist.,” and _lapis electricus_ by Linnæus in his\r\n“Flora Zeylanica” (U. Aldrovandus, “Mus. Metal.”; Philemon Holland,\r\n“The Historie of the World,” commonly called “The Naturall Historie of\r\nC. Plinius Secundus,” London, 1601).\r\n\r\nTheophrastus and Pliny speak of this native magnet as possessing, like\r\namber, the property of attracting straw, dried leaves, bark and other\r\nlight bodies. The different sorts of loadstones, of which the best were\r\nblue in colour (as stated by Taisnier, Porta, Barthol. de Glanville and\r\nothers), are thus alluded to by Pliny (“Nat. Hist.,” lib. xxxvi. cap.\r\n16): “Sotacus describes five kinds: the Æthiopian; that of Magnesia, a\r\ncountry which borders on Macedonia; a third from Hyettus, in Boetia; a\r\nfourth from Alexandria, in Troas; and a fifth from Magnesia, in Asia”\r\n(Porta, “Natural Magick,” Book VII. chap. i.). He further says that\r\niron cannot resist it; “the moment the metal approaches it, it springs\r\ntoward the magnet, and, as it clasps it, is held fast in the magnet’s\r\nembrace.” It is by many called _ferrum vivum_, or quick iron.[6]\r\n\r\nClaudian speaks of it as “a stone which is preferred to all that is\r\nmost precious in the East.... Iron gives it life and nourishes it”\r\n(Claudian, Idyl V; Ennemoser, “Hist. of Magic,” Vol. II. p. 27).\r\n\r\nHippocrates, the father of medical science, calls it “the stone which\r\ncarries away iron.”\r\n\r\nEpicurus, an Athenian of the Ægean tribe, says: “The _loadstone or\r\nmagnet_ attracts iron, because the particles which are continually\r\nflowing from it, as from all bodies, have such a peculiar fitness in\r\nform to those which flow from iron that, upon collision, they easily\r\nunite.... The mutual attraction of _amber_ and like bodies may be\r\nexplained in the same manner.”\r\n\r\nHier. Cardan intimates that “it is a certain appetite or desire\r\nof nutriment that makes the loadstone snatch the iron....” (“De\r\nSubtilitate,” Basileæ, 1611, lib. vii. p. 381).\r\n\r\nDiogenes of Apollonia (lib. ii. “Nat. Quæst.,” cap. xxiii.) says that\r\n“there is humidity in iron which the dryness of the magnet feeds upon.”\r\n\r\nCornelius Gemma supposed invisible lines to stretch from the magnet to\r\nthe attracted body, a conception which, says Prof. Tyndall, reminds us\r\nof Faraday’s lines of force.\r\n\r\nLucretius accounts for the adhesion of the steel to the loadstone by\r\nsaying that on the surface of the magnet there are hooks, and, on the\r\nsurface of the steel, little rings which the hooks catch hold of.\r\n\r\nThales, Aristotle, Anaxagoras of Clazomenæ and the Greek sophist\r\nHippias, ascribe the loadstone’s attractive virtue to the _soul_ with\r\nwhich they say it is endowed. Humboldt (“Cosmos,” article on the\r\nMagnetic Needle) says _soul_ signifies here “the inner principle of\r\nthe moving agent,” and he adds in a footnote: “Aristotle (“De Anima,”\r\nI. 2) speaks only of the animation of the magnet as of an opinion that\r\noriginated with Thales.” Diogenes Laertius interprets this statement as\r\napplying also distinctly to amber, for he says: “Aristotle and Hippias\r\nmaintain as to the doctrine enounced by Thales.”\r\n\r\nThe native magnet appears to have long been known in nearly every\r\nquarter of the globe (Humboldt, “Cosmos,” 1848, Vol. V., and Harris,\r\n“Rudimentary Magnetism,” Parts I and II).\r\n\r\nIn the Talmud, it is called _achzhàb’th_, the stone which attracts;\r\nin the Aztec, _tlaihiomani tetl_, the stone that draws by its breath;\r\nin the Sanscrit, _ayaskânta_, loving toward iron; in the Siamese,\r\n_me-lek_, that which attracts iron; in the Chinese, _thsu-chy_, love\r\nstone, also _hy-thy-chy_, stone that snatches up iron; in the French,\r\n_l’aimant_, and in the Spanish, _iman_, loving stone; in the Hungarian,\r\n_magnet kö_, love stone; while in the Greek it is called _siderites_,\r\nowing to its resemblance to iron.\r\n\r\nFor _lyncurium_ of the ancients see _Phil. Trans._, Vol. LI. p. 394,\r\nand Hutton’s “Abridgments,” Vol. XI. p. 419.\r\n\r\nEuripides (“Fragmenta Euripidis,” Didot edit., 1846, p. 757) called it\r\n_lapis herculaneus_, from its power over iron, and it was also known as\r\n_lapis heracleus_, doubtless because the best was, at one time, said\r\nto be found near Heraclea in Lydia (Plato, “Ion”--Burgess--Vol. IV. p.\r\n294; see, besides, Blavatsky, “Isis Unveiled,” Vol. I. p. 130; Hervart\r\n(J. F.), Ingolstadii, 1623).\r\n\r\nIt has likewise been designated as follows: Chinese, _tchu-chy_,\r\ndirecting stone; Icelandic, _leiderstein_, leading stone; Swedish,\r\n_segel-sten_, seeing stone; Tonkinin, _d’ànamtchûm_, stone which shows\r\nthe south; and, by reason of its great hardness, the Greeks called\r\nit _calamita_; the Italians _calamita_; the French _calamite_, also\r\n_diamant_; the Hebrews _khalamish_ or _kalmithath_, and the Romans\r\n_adamas_, while _adamant_ was the name given to the magnetic needle\r\n(compass) by the English of the time of Edward III (T. H. H. Martin,\r\n“De l’aimant, de ses noms divers et de ses variétés,” Paris, 1861;\r\nButtmann, “Bemerkungen ... des Magnetes und des Basaltes,” 1808, Band\r\nII.; G. A. Palm, “Der Magnet in Alterthum,” 1867).[7]\r\n\r\n“This stone adamas is dyuers and other than an Magnas, for yf an adamas\r\nbe sette by yren it suffryth not the yren come to the magnas, but\r\ndrawyth it by a manere of vyolence fro the magnas” (Trevisa, “Barth, de\r\nProp, reb.,” XVI. 8).[8]\r\n\r\n“The adamant cannot draw yron if the diamond lye by it” (Lyly,\r\n“Euphues,” sig. K. p. 10).\r\n\r\n“Right as an adamound, iwys, can drawen to hym sotylly the yren” (“Rom.\r\nRose”).\r\n\r\n“In Ynde groweth the admont stone ... she by her nature draweth to her\r\nyron” (Caxton, “Myrrour,” II. vii. 79).\r\n\r\n“The adamant placed neare any iron will suffer it to be drawen away of\r\nthe lode stone” (Maplet, “Greene Forest,” I.).\r\n\r\n“You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant; but yet you draw not iron; for\r\nmy heart is true as steel” (Shakespeare, “Midsum. Night’s Dream,” Act.\r\nii. sc. 1).\r\n\r\n“As sun to day, as turtle to her mate, as iron to adamant”\r\n(Shakespeare, “Troilus and Cressida,” Act iii. sc. 2).\r\n\r\n“The grace of God’s spirit, like the true load stone or adamant, draws\r\nup the yron heart of man to it” (Bishop Hall, “Occas. Medit.,” 52.).\r\n\r\n“The adamant ... is such an enemy to the magnet that, if it be bound to\r\nit, it will not attract iron” (Leonardus, “Mirr. Stones,” 63).\r\n\r\nAccording to Beckmann (Bohn, 1846, pp. 86–98) the real _tourmaline_ was\r\nfirst brought from Ceylon (where the natives called it _tournamal_),\r\nat the end of the seventeenth century or beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury (see A.D. 1707).\r\n\r\nIt is classed by Pliny as a variety of carbuncle (lib. xxxvii. cap.\r\nvii.). John de Laet says (“De Gemmis,” 1647, 8vo, p. 155): “The\r\ndescription of the _lyncurium_ does not ill agree with the hyacinth of\r\nthe moderns.” Watson thinks likewise (“Phil. Trans.,” Vol. LI. p. 394)\r\nand so does John Serapion-Serapio Mauritanus--Yuhanna Ibn Serapion Ben\r\nIbrahim (alluded to by Gilbert, “De Magnete,” Book I. chap. i.) in his\r\n“Lib. de simplicibus medicinis,” Argent. 1531, fol. p. 263; and Anselm\r\nBoèce de Boot, Flemish naturalist (“Gem. et Lap. Hist.,” Leyden, 1636);\r\nwhile Epiphanius (“De Gemmis,” XII.) states that he could find in the\r\nBible no mention of the _lyncurium_, which latter he also believes to\r\nhave been the hyacinth. On the other hand, the Duke de Noya Caraffa\r\n(“Recueil de Mém. Æpinus,” Petersb. 1762, 8vo, p. 122) considers the\r\n_tourmaline_ to be identical with the _theamedes_ of the ancients\r\n(Pliny, lib. xx. 50, and xxxvi., 25; Cardan, “De Subtilitate,” lib.\r\nvii. p. 386).\r\n\r\nThe _betylos_ has doubtless been likewise named in this connection.\r\nStrabo, Pliny, Helancius--all speak of the electrical or\r\nelectro-magnetic power of the betyli. They were worshipped in the\r\nremotest antiquity in Egypt and Samothrace as magnetic stones\r\n“containing souls which had fallen from heaven,” and the priests\r\nof Cybelè wore a small _betylos_ on their bodies (Blavatsky, “Isis\r\nUnveiled,” Vol. I. p. 332).\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Enfield, “Dict.

Therein it is\r\nsaid: “Timochares (and not Dinochares, Dinocrates, Demochrates or\r\nChirocrates) suspended the statue in mid-air (_dans les hauteurs\r\naëriennes du temple_).... Under the ceiling-vault crowned with\r\nloadstones, a bluish magnet draws, by means of an iron hair, the young\r\nwoman it holds in its embrace.”\r\n\r\n“Dinocrates began to make the arched roofe of the temple of Arsinoë all\r\nof magnet, or this loadstone, to the end, that within that temple the\r\nstatue of the said princesse made of yron, might seeme to hang in the\r\naire by nothing” (Holland, “Plinie,” Book XXXIV. cap. 14).\r\n\r\nKing Theodoric alludes (Cassiodor, “Variar,” lib. i. epist. 45) to a\r\nstatue of Cupid in the temple of Diana at Ephesus (one of the seven\r\nWonders of the World), and St. Augustine (“De Civitate Dei,” XXI. 6)\r\nspeaks of a bronze figure in the temple of Serapis at Alexandria, both\r\nsuspended by means of a magnet attached to the ceiling.[9]\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--De Mirmont, “La Moselle,” 1889, “Commentaire,”\r\n   pp. 93 and 95; St. Isidore, “Originum,” lib. xvi. cap. 4; G.\r\n   Cedrinus, “Compend.

Hist. et Crit.”), was\r\nexcited solely by the attractive property of the loadstone.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Father Joseph de Acosta (“Natural and Moral History of the\r\nIndies,” translation of C. R. Markham, lib. i. cap. 16) thus alludes to\r\nthe above subject: “I finde not that, in ancient bookes, there is any\r\nmention made of the vse of the Iman or Loadstone, nor of the Compasse\r\n(_aguja de marear_) to saile by; I beleeve they had no knowledge\r\nthereof.... Plinie speakes nothing of that vertue it hath, alwaies\r\nto turne yron which it toucheth towards the north.... Aristotle,\r\nTheophrastus, Dioscorides, Lucretius, Saint Augustine, nor any other\r\nwriters or Naturall Philosophers that I have seene, make any mention\r\nthereof, although they treat of the loadstone.”\r\n\r\nThomas Creech, in the notes to his translation of Lucretius’ “De\r\nNatura” says: “Nor indeed, do any of the ancients treat of this last\r\n(the directive) power of the loadstone ... and Guido Pancirollus justly\r\nplaces it among the modern inventions.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Klaproth, “La Boussole,” Paris, 1834, pp. 9, 10,\r\n   66; Azuni, “Boussole,” Paris, 1809, p. 30; “English Cycl.”--Arts\r\n   and Sciences--Vol. V. p. 420; Humboldt, “Cosmos,” 1848, Vol. II.\r\n   p. 628; John Francis Davis, “The Chinese,” London, 1836, Vol.\r\n   II. pp. 221, etc., or the 1844 edition, Vol. III. p. 12; Geo.\r\n   Adams, “Essay ...” 1785, p. 428.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 218.=--Salmasius, in his Commentary upon Solinus, asserts\r\nthat, at this date, amber was known among the Arabs as _Karabe_, or\r\n_Kahrubá_, a word which, Avicenna states, is of Persian origin and\r\nsignifies the power of attracting straws; the magnet being called\r\n_Ahang-rubá_, or attractor of iron.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Encycl.

The “Amer. Journ. of Science and the\r\nArts” (Vol. XL. p. 249) adds that, from this date, the construction of\r\na magnetic car seems to have been a puzzle ... and the knowledge of\r\nthe invention appears to have been confined within very narrow limits.\r\nHumboldt says that the magnetic wagon was used as late as the fifteenth\r\ncentury of our era; the “American Journal” states that it cannot be\r\ntraced later than 1609.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 265–419.=--What is by many believed to be the earliest reliable,\r\ndistinct mention or actually printed record of the use of the magnet\r\nfor navigation, appears in the justly prominent Chinese dictionary or\r\nrather encyclopædia, “Poei-wen-yun-fou,” wherein it is mentioned that\r\nthere were during this period (that of the second Tsin dynasty) ships\r\ndirected to the South by the _ching_ or needle. It is likewise therein\r\nstated that the figure then placed upon the magnetic cars represented\r\n“a genius in a feather dress” and that, when the emperor went out upon\r\nstate occasions this car “always led the way and served to indicate the\r\nfour points of the compass.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Homer at B.C. 1000–907; Davis, “The Chinese,” Vol.\r\n   III. p. 12; Klaproth, “Boussole,” pp. 66, 67; Johnson, “Univ.\r\n   Cycl.,” Vol. I. p. 927. ed. 1877; Miller, “Hist.

When this needle floats on the\r\nwater it is much agitated. If the fingernails touch the upper edge\r\nof the basin in which it floats, they agitate it strongly; only it\r\ncontinues to slide and falls easily. It is preferable, in order to show\r\nits virtues in the best way, to suspend it as follows: Take a single\r\nfilament from a piece of new cotton and attach it exactly to the middle\r\nof the needle by a bit of wax as large as a mustard seed. Hang it up in\r\na place where there is no wind. Then the needle always shows the south;\r\nbut among such needles there are some which, being rubbed, indicate the\r\nnorth. Our soothsayers have some which show the south and some which\r\nshow the north.

When two flames are\r\nseen together, they are called Castor and Pollux, “twin gods of the\r\nsea, guiding the mariner to port,” and are considered by seamen an\r\nindication of good luck and of fine weather; but when only one flame is\r\nvisible it is called Helena, and is supposed to be an evil omen, the\r\nbeacon of an avenging God luring the sailor to death.\r\n\r\nSt. Elmo’s fire is also known to the Italians as the fire of _St.\r\nPeter_ and of _St. Nicholas_, to the Portuguese as _San Telmo_ and\r\nas _Corpos Santos_, and to the English sailors as _comazant_ or\r\n_corposant_.\r\n\r\nThe historian of Columbus’ second voyage says that during the month\r\nof October 1493 “St. Elmo appeared on the topgallant-masts with seven\r\nlighted tapers.” It is also alluded to by Pliny, “Nat.

He was probably the most voluminous writer of the earlier\r\nChristian centuries. He was the author of no less than 232 books, in\r\naddition to many tractates or homilies and innumerable epistles (“Books\r\nand their Makers, during the Middle Ages,” Geo. Haven Putnam, New York,\r\n1896, Vol. I. p. 3). In the “De Civitate Dei” he tells us (Basileæ,\r\n1522, pp. 718–719) of the experiment alluded to herein at A.D. 1558.\r\nThis had better be given in his own words (“De Civitate Dei,” lib. ii.\r\ncap. 4, Dod’s translation, Edinburgh, 1871):\r\n\r\n“When I first saw it (the attraction of the magnet), I was\r\nthunderstruck (_vehementer inhorrui_), for I saw an iron ring attracted\r\nand suspended by the stone; and then, as if it had communicated its\r\nown property to the iron it attracted and had made it a substance like\r\nitself, this ring was put near another and lifted it up, and, as the\r\nfirst ring clung to the magnet, so did the second ring to the first.\r\nA third and fourth were similarly added, so that there hung from\r\nthe stone a kind of chain of rings with their hoops connected, not\r\ninterlinking but attached together by their outer surface. Who would\r\nnot be amazed by this virtue of the stone, subsisting as it does, not\r\nonly in itself, but transmitted through so many suspended rings and\r\nbinding them together by invisible links? Yet far more astonishing\r\nis what I heard about the stone from my brother in the episcopate,\r\nSeverus, Bishop of Milevis. He told me that Bathanarius, once Count of\r\nAfrica, when the Bishop was dining with him, produced a magnet and held\r\nit under a silver plate on which he placed a bit of iron; then as he\r\nmoved his hand with the magnet underneath the plate, the iron upon the\r\nplate moved about accordingly. The intervening silver was not affected\r\nat all, but precisely as the magnet was moved backward and forward\r\nbelow it, no matter how quickly, so was the iron attracted above. I\r\nhave related what I have myself witnessed: I have related what I was\r\ntold by one whom I trust as I trust my own eyes.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Vie de St. Augustin,” by Poujoulat, second\r\n   edition, Paris, 1852, and by G.

It\r\nattracts iron and unites itself with it; and, for this reason, it is\r\ncommonly called the stone which licks up iron. When an iron point is\r\nrubbed upon the magnet, it acquires the property of pointing to the\r\nsouth, yet it declines always to the east, and is not perfectly true to\r\nthe south.... If the needle be passed through a wick or a small tube of\r\nthin reed, and placed upon water, it will indicate the south, but with\r\na continual inclination towards the point _ping_, that is to say, East\r\nfive-sixths South.”\r\n\r\nIn the “Mung-khi-py-than,” also composed under the Soung dynasty, it is\r\nstated that fortune-tellers rub the needle with the loadstone in order\r\nto make it indicate the south.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Comptes Rendus_, Vol. XIX. p. 365; “Am.

It is therein said\r\nthat sailors were at that time in the habit of rubbing needles upon the\r\nugly brown stone called _marinière_, “to which iron adheres of its\r\nown accord,” and that, as soon as placed afloat upon a small piece of\r\nstraw in the water, the needles would point to the North. The passage\r\nalluding to the compass has been copied by D. A. Azuni, member of the\r\nTurin Academy of Sciences, from the original manuscript, and is given\r\nentire, with the French translation, at p. 137 of his “Dissertation\r\n...” second edition, Paris, 1809:\r\n\r\n    “De notre père l’apostoile (le pape)\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Ils l’appellent la tresmontaigne\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Par la vertu de la marinière,\r\n    Une pierre laide et brumière,\r\n    Ou li fers volontiers se joint....”\r\n\r\nThe passage is also given by Klaproth, at pp. 41–43, and by Venanson,\r\nat p. 72, of their respective works already cited; likewise by\r\nBertelli, p. 59 of his Memoir published in 1868.\r\n\r\nSonnini (C.

In these he states that the seamen of his\r\ntime employed instruments of measurement, sea charts and the magnetic\r\nneedle (_tenian_, _los mareantes_, _instrumento_, _carta_, _compas y\r\naguja_), and he describes the improvements made in the astrolabes\r\n(designed for the determination of time and of geographical latitudes\r\nby meridian altitudes and capable of being employed at sea) from the\r\nperiod that the astrolabium of the Majorcan pilots was in use.\r\n\r\nThe application of the astrolabe to navigation, Mr. Irving says (“Hist.\r\nof the Life ... of Columbus,” London, 1828, Vol. I. pp. 76–78), was\r\n“one of those timely events which seem to have some thing providential\r\nin them. It was immediately after this that Columbus proposed his\r\nvoyage of discovery to the crown of Portugal.”\r\n\r\nLully also confirms the fact that the Barcelonians employed atlases,\r\nastrolabes[11] and compasses long before Don Jaime Ferrer penetrated to\r\nthe mouth of the Rio de Ouro, on the western coast of Africa, which was\r\nabout fifty years after the date of the last-named work.\r\n\r\nIncidentally it may be added that Lully, posing as an alchemist, is\r\nsaid to have in the presence of the English King, Edward I, converted\r\niron into gold, which latter was coined into rose-nobles (Bergman,\r\n“Hist. of Chem.”; Louis Figuier, “L’Alchimie et les Alchimistes,”\r\nParis, 1860, p. 148).\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--For Lul.

He cites Aristotle as having written a book,\r\n“De Lapide,” containing a notice of the magnet’s use in navigation,\r\nbut none of Aristotle’s known works appear to have the passage given.\r\nCabæus and others rather judge that book to be the work of some Arabic\r\nwriter (Thomas Creech, “Lucretius”). Libri, however, says that a\r\ntranslation or _abrégé_ of the MS. of “De Lapide” is at the Paris\r\nLibrary--MSS. Arabes, No. 402 (“Hist. des sc. Mathém.,” Vol. I. p. 101).\r\n\r\nLe Sieur Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt (see A.D. 1269) alludes\r\nclearly to the polarity of the needle in an epistle, “Ad Sigerum de\r\nFoucaucourt--Fontancourt--militem de Magnete,” written toward the end\r\nof the thirteenth century, and the magnet is, at about the same period,\r\nreferred to in the following lines of the minstrel Gauthier d’Espinois,\r\ncontemporary of the Count of Champagne, Thibaud VI, who lived before\r\nthe middle of the thirteenth century (“Hist. Lit. de la France,” 1856,\r\nVol. XXIII--chansonniers--pp. 576, 831):\r\n\r\n    “Tout autresi (ainsi) comme l’aimant déçoit (détourne)\r\n    L’aiguilette par force de vertu\r\n    A ma dame tot le mont (monde) retennue\r\n    Qui sa beauté connoit et aperçoit.”\r\n\r\nVincent de Beauvais applies the terms _zohron_ and _aphron_ (not\r\n_afon_) to the south and north ends of the needle, and Mr. J. Klaproth\r\n(“Lettre à M. de Humboldt sur l’invention de la Boussole,” Paris, 1834,\r\npp. 49–51), says these words are Arabian, notwithstanding assertions\r\nmade to the contrary by Martinus Lipenius in his “Navigatio Salomonis\r\nOphiritica Illustrata,” 1660, cap. v. sec. 3, as well as by many others\r\nwho have written upon the compass.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Sonnini, in Buffon, “Minéraux,” VIII. p. 76;\r\n   Humboldt, “Cosmos,” 1859–1860, Vol. II. pp. 253–254, and Vol.\r\n   V. p. 54; Azuni, “Boussole,” pp. 41, 42, and 44; Klaproth, p.\r\n   13; Miller, “History Philosophically Illustrated,” London, 1849,\r\n   Vol. I. p. 179, note. “Simonis Maioli ...

(See the different entries concerning the last-named\r\nwork at pp. 663–664 of Libri’s Catalogue, Vol. II, for 1861.) One more\r\nwork bears title “Picture of the World”--“l’Image du Monde”--written\r\nby Gautier de Metz, a French poet of the thirteenth century, on the\r\nlines of still another encyclopædic “Imago Mundi,” by Honorius d’Autun\r\n(Neubauer, “Traductions historiques de l’Image du Monde,” 1876, p.\r\n129; Haase, likewise Fritsche, “Untersuch ... der Image du Monde,”\r\n1879 and 1880; Fant, “l’Image du Monde, étudié dans ses diverses\r\nrédactions françaises,” Upsal, 1886.

Shields, New York, 1877, p. 133).\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1254.=--Albertus Magnus, of the family of the Counts of\r\nBollstädt, one of the most prominent philosophers and theologians of\r\nthe Middle Ages, likewise alludes to the book “De Lapide” already\r\nreferred to at A.D. 1250, and to the Arabic terms _zohron_ and\r\n_aphron_, giving to these words, however, a wrong interpretation.[13]\r\n\r\nAlbertus Magnus (1193–1280) was justly styled _Doctor Universalis_,\r\nfor, from the time he entered the Order of the Dominican Friars\r\nin 1221, as well as throughout his teachings, mainly at Bologna,\r\nStrasburg, Freiburg and Cologne, he displayed an intimate acquaintance\r\nwith almost all branches of the natural sciences. He was especially\r\nwell versed in philosophy, astronomy and mathematics--_in rebus magicis\r\nexpertus fuit_--and was justly considered by many as the most erudite\r\nphilosopher of his generation; an encomium of the very rarest kind,\r\nwhen such rivals as Alexander of Hales and Thomas Aquinas could dispute\r\nthe palm with him. Natural science, says Humboldt (“Cosmos,” 1860,\r\nVol. II. pp. 243–245), was intimately associated with medicine and\r\nphilosophy among the learned Arabs, and, in the Christian Middle Ages,\r\nwith theological polemics. The latter, from their tendency to assert an\r\nexclusive influence, repressed empirical inquiry into the departments\r\nof physics, organic morphology, and also astronomy, the last being,\r\nfor the most part, closely allied to astrology. The study of the\r\ncomprehensive works of Aristotle, introduced by Arabs and by Jewish\r\nRabbis, had tended to lead to a philosophical fusion of all branches\r\nof study (Jourdain, “Sur les traductions d’Aristotle,” p. 256; Michael\r\nSachs, “Die Religiöse Poesie der Juden in Spanien,” 1845, s. 180–200),\r\nand hence Ibn-Sina (Avicenna), Ibn-Roschd (Averroës), Albertus Magnus\r\nand Roger Bacon passed for the representatives of all the knowledge of\r\ntheir time. The fame which in the Middle Ages surrounded the names of\r\nthese four great men was proportionate to the general diffusion of this\r\nopinion of their endowments.\r\n\r\nAlbertus was the first scholastic who systematically reproduced the\r\nphilosophy of Aristotle with reference to the Arabian commentators and\r\nwho remodelled it to meet the requirements of ecclesiastical dogma.\r\nThe cause of the new development of scholasticism in the thirteenth\r\ncentury was the translation, for the first time, into Latin of the\r\ncomplete works of Aristotle, which latter only came to the knowledge of\r\nthe scholastics (1210–1225) through the agency of Arabian philosophy.\r\nThe leading Arabian philosophers were Avicenna, Averroës and Avempace,\r\nwhilst, in the new movement, Albertus Magnus, St. Thomas Aquinas and\r\nJoannes Duns Scotus represented the culmination of scholastic thought\r\nand its consolidation into a system.[14]\r\n\r\nAlbertus, according to Humboldt, must be mentioned as an independent\r\ninvestigator in the domain of analytic chemistry, improving as he did\r\nthe practical manipulation of ores, and having actually enlarged the\r\ninsight of men into the general mode of action of the chemical forces\r\nof nature. His “Liber Cosmographicus” is a singularly able presentment\r\nof physical geography. He also wrote very extensively upon plant-life,\r\nand is the author of commentaries upon practically all the physical\r\nworks of the Stagirite, although in the commentary on Aristotle’s\r\n“Historia Animalium” he is said to have closely followed the Latin\r\ntranslation of Michael Scotus from the Arabic. Albertus doubtless owes\r\nthe praise conferred upon him by Dante less to himself than to his\r\nbeloved pupil Aquinas, who accompanied him from Cologne to Paris in\r\n1245, and returned with him to Germany in 1248.\r\n\r\n    “Questi, che m’ è a destra più vicino,\r\n    Frate e maestro fummi; ed’ esse Alberto\r\n    E’ di Cologna, ed io Thomas d’Aquino.”\r\n\r\n    “Il Paradiso,” X. 97–99.\r\n\r\nGilbert refers to Albertus in “De Magnete,” Book I. chaps, i. and vi.,\r\nalso in Book II. chap. xxxviii.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Albert the Great,” by Dr. Joachim Sighart,\r\n   translated by Rev.

Plumptre, 1866),\r\nsometimes called Friar Bacon (1214–1294), a Franciscan monk of\r\nIlchester, who devoted himself to the study of science at Oxford and\r\nParis and “whose deep penetration into the mysteries of nature justly\r\nentitled him to the appellation of “The Wonderful Doctor,” treats of\r\nthe magnet and of its properties at pp. 383–384 of his “Opus Minus” (J.\r\nS. Brewer, “Fr. R. Bacon,” London, 1859), and dwells upon the loadstone\r\nas a _miraculum in parte notum_.\r\n\r\nBacon is also the author of many other works, the most important of\r\nwhich are his “Opus Majus” and “Opus Tertium” (first published in\r\nEnglish respectively in 1733 and 1859), the last named having been\r\noriginally written out for Pope Clement IV and intended to serve as a\r\npreamble to the “Opus Minus” and “Opus Majus,” although it was later\r\nthan either in the date of its composition (Brewer, _op. cit._ p.\r\nxliv). Leland has said that it is easier to collect the leaves of the\r\nSybil than the titles of all of Bacon’s works. At pp. 218–222, Vol.\r\nIII. of the ninth edition “Encyclopædia Britannica” will be found a\r\nsynopsis of the six parts into which Jebb divided the “Opus Majus”\r\n(pronounced by Whewell “at once the Encyclopædia and the Organum of\r\nthe thirteenth century”), and likewise an account of his other works,\r\nbesides numerous references to leading authorities.\r\n\r\nIn the “Opus Tertium,” the last of the series of three which, it is\r\nsaid, were all completed in about eighteen months, he speaks more than\r\nonce of A.D. 1267 as being the then current year. This happens\r\nto be but two years prior to the date of the epistle of Pierre Pélerin\r\nde Maricourt, the great experimentalist (Petrus Peregrinus), whom he\r\ncommends (p. lxxv) in the following words: “For there are only two\r\nperfect mathematicians, Master John of London[16] and Master Peter of\r\nMaricourt, the Picard ... who is worth more than any of them ... of\r\nwhom I have fully written in my ‘Opus Minus’ and of whom I shall write\r\nmore in its proper place.” Of this Master Peter, whom he calls one\r\nof his most illustrious pupils, he further says that, being “struck\r\nwith the genius that dawned in his countenance,” he took him under his\r\nprotection from his fifteenth year and instructed him so carefully\r\nthat he outstripped all of his contemporaries both at Oxford and at\r\nParis. “There is no one,” adds he, “who knows so much of the root of\r\nPhilosophy ...” and one who, “through experiment, gains such knowledge\r\nof things natural, medical, chemical; indeed, of everything in the\r\nheavens or earth.”\r\n\r\nGilbert states (“De Magnete,” Book I. chap. i.) that many believe the\r\nwork of Peter Peregrinus on the magnet owes its origin to the opinions\r\nof Roger Bacon. And in the Appendix I to Brewer’s work--p. 537, chap.\r\nvi. “De Experimentis Mirabilibus”--will be found Bacon’s views fully\r\nexposed on the operations of the magnet.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Fratris Rogeri Bacon, O.

In Canto XII. vv. 28–30 of his “Paradiso,” translated by Dr.\r\nPlumptre, he thus alludes to the mariner’s compass:\r\n\r\n    “Then from the heart of one of those new lights,\r\n    There came a voice which made me turn to see,\r\n    E’en as the star the needle’s course incites.”\r\n\r\nGuido Guinicelli (1240–1276), priest and scholar, and whom Dante\r\nconsidered not only the greatest of living Bolognese poets, but his\r\nmaster in poetry (Note: “Purg.,” XXVI. Vol. I. p. 327, v. 92) refers to\r\nthe nautical compass in nearly the same terms as Dante (“Rime. Ant.,”\r\np. 295). He adds: “The mountains of loadstone give the virtue to the\r\nair of attracting iron, but, because it (the loadstone) is far off,\r\n(it) wishes to have the help of a similar stone to make it (the virtue)\r\nwork, and to direct the needle toward the star” (P.

J. Butler, London, 1885, Canto XII. v.\r\n29, reads: “_Si mosse voce, che l’ago (needle) alla stella_,” and\r\nFazio degli Uberti in the “Dittamondo” (about 1360) has “_Quel gran\r\ndisio, che mi, traeva addietro come ago a calamita_” (III. 2).\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Hœfer, “Nouv.

Most of\r\nthese have been very ably analyzed by P. D. Timoteo Bertelli Barnabita\r\nin the exhaustive Memoirs published by him in Rome during 1868, and\r\nstill better detailed by Dr. Silvanus P. Thompson in his several\r\nvaluable printed researches and lectures on the subject, but there has\r\nbeen of it only one printed issue in book form, that of the Lindau\r\nphysician, A. P. Gasser, which appeared at Augsburg during 1558.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts at translation have been made, notably by Guillaume\r\nLibri (“Histoire des Sciences Mathématiques ...” Paris, 1838, Vol. II.\r\np. 487) who admitted that, with the aid of several paleographers, he\r\ncould not decipher many of the abbreviated faint characters existing in\r\nthe Bibliothèque Nationale manuscript (No. 7378A in quarto,\r\nat folio 67), and by Tiberius Cavallo, who does scarcely better with\r\nthe Leyden copy (Fol. Cod. No. 227) which was discovered by him,\r\nand but a portion of which he transcribes in the supplement to his\r\n“Treatise on Magnetism,” London, 1800, pp. 299–320. A translation\r\nwas also made by Brother Arnold, of the La Salle Institute in Troy,\r\nN.Y., and published during 1904, but the most meritorious version now\r\nexisting is the one entitled “Done into English by Silvanus P. Thompson\r\nfrom the printed Latin versions of Gasser 1558, Bertelli 1868, and\r\nHellmann 1898, and amended by reference to the manuscript copy in his\r\npossession, formerly amongst the Phillipps’ manuscripts, dated 1391.”\r\nThis translation, “printed in the year 1902, in the Caxton type, to the\r\nnumber of 250 copies,” reflects very great credit upon Prof. Thompson,\r\nwho has given us such a faithful interpretation of the original work\r\nas would naturally be expected at his hands, and who has, besides,\r\nrubricated this right royal little volume and caused it to be issued in\r\none of the most attractive typographical fashions of the Chiswick Press.\r\n\r\nThe Hellmann 1898 Berlin version just alluded to, which appeared in\r\n“Neudrucke von Schriften und Karten ...” No. 10 (_Rara Magnetica_),\r\ncontains a photographic reproduction of the Augsburg 1558 title-page,\r\nand, it may be added, the volume of Phillipps’ manuscripts, of\r\nwhich Prof. Thompson became the fortunate possessor, includes one\r\nof Chaucer’s treatises on the Astrolabe, besides the Peregrinus’\r\nmanuscript in question.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1562 much of the original epistle was pilfered by\r\nJoannes Taisnier Hannonius, who badly condensed and deformed it and\r\nincorporated it as new matter, conjointly with some papers of his own,\r\nin a book entitled “Oposculum ... de Natura Magnetis et ejus effectibus\r\n...” Coloniæ, 1562; and that much was translated “into Englishe” by\r\nRicharde Eden, London, about 1579, under title of “A very necessarie\r\nand profitable booke concerning navigation.”\r\n\r\nMuch has been said at different times regarding the contents of the\r\nabove-named epistle, the full title of the Paris MS. No. 7378 of which\r\nreads\r\n\r\n    “_Epistola Petri Peregrini de Maricourt ad Sygerum de Foucaucourt\r\n    militem de magnete_,”\r\n\r\nbut no _résumé_ of it could better be given than by quoting here its\r\nfirst page, which has been translated as follows:\r\n\r\n   This treatise on the magnet contains two parts, of which Part I\r\n   is complete in ten chapters, and Part II in three.\r\n\r\n   Of Part I: Chap. I states the object of the work;\r\n\r\n   Chap. II, of what the investigator in this line of work should\r\n   be;\r\n\r\n   Chap. III, of a knowledge of the loadstone;\r\n\r\n   Chap. IV, of the science of the discovery of the parts of the\r\n   loadstone;\r\n\r\n   Chap. V, of the source of the discovery of poles in the\r\n   loadstone--which of them is the north and which the south;\r\n\r\n   Chap. VI, in what manner a magnet attracts a magnet;\r\n\r\n   Chap. VII, how iron touched with the magnet turns towards the\r\n   poles of the globe;\r\n\r\n   Chap. VIII, in what manner a magnet attracts iron;\r\n\r\n   Chap. IX, why the northern part attracts the southern part, and\r\n   the converse;\r\n\r\n   Chap. X, of the inquiry whence the magnet derives the natural\r\n   power it possesses.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Petrus Peregrinus. “Epistola ... de Magnete.”\r\n\r\n  The earliest known treatise of experimental science, now in\r\n  the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.]\r\n\r\n   Of Part II: Chap. I, on the construction of an instrument\r\n   (floating compass) by which the azimuth of the sun and moon, and\r\n   of any star above the horizon, can be ascertained;\r\n\r\n   Chap. II, on the construction of a better instrument (pivoted\r\n   compass) for like purpose;\r\n\r\n   Chap. III, on the construction of a wheel for perpetual motion.\r\n\r\nAn analyzation of each chapter in turn will show how satisfactorily\r\nPeregrinus has developed, in connected series, all of the early\r\nexperiments upon which are based his theories of the loadstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART I\r\n\r\n   Chap. I states that the intention or object of the work is to\r\n   make known the hitherto hidden nature, occult properties, of\r\n   the loadstone, the art of treating the latter, the making of\r\n   scientific instruments, and matters of interest to students of\r\n   nature, astrologers and sailors.\r\n\r\n   Chap. II. The investigator in this line should know the natures\r\n   of things and understand the motions of the heavenly bodies,\r\n   but, above all, he should be assiduous in handiwork for\r\n   experimental research.\r\n\r\n   Chap. III indicates four different requisite qualities of the\r\n   loadstone, and tells where they are to be found and how to\r\n   select and test them--the best of them being free from flaws, of\r\n   great density and of a bluish or celestial colour.\r\n\r\n   Chap. IV shows how to find in the loadstone the two poles,\r\n   one north and the other south, using preferably a globular\r\n   magnet,[17] placing thereon a needle or an oblong piece of\r\n   iron, and, either drawing lines in the direction taken by the\r\n   needle, so that they “may meet at two points, just as all the\r\n   meridian circles of the world meet at the two opposite poles\r\n   of the world,” or, by merely marking the magnet so that “the\r\n   opposite points will be correctly placed just as are the poles\r\n   in a sphere.”\r\n\r\n   Chap. V. In order to find the poles in a stone--which of them is\r\n   the North and which the South--take a round wooden vessel shaped\r\n   like a skiff (_paropsidis_, _parascidis_), and place\r\n   the stone therein, then put the vessel containing the stone into\r\n   another large vessel filled with water, so that the first-named\r\n   vessel may float into the larger one: “The stone in the first\r\n   vessel will be like a sailor in a ship, and the first vessel\r\n   may float roomily into the second as does a ship in a river,\r\n   and the stone so placed will turn its small vessel acting as\r\n   the Northern pole in the direction of the Northern heaven....\r\n   If this pole were then turned away a thousand times, a thousand\r\n   times would it return to its place by the will of God.”\r\n\r\n   Chap. VI. Having found which pole is the Northern, mark it so\r\n   that it may be known when necessary. Place the stone into a\r\n   small vessel, as shown in Chap. V, then hold another stone in\r\n   the hand and approach its Northern part to the Southern part of\r\n   the stone floating in the vessel, and the floating stone will\r\n   follow the other “as if it wished to adhere thereto.... Know\r\n   that, as a rule, the Northern part of one stone attracts the\r\n   Southern part of another stone and the Southern the Northern.”\r\n\r\n   Chap. VII. When the needle or oblong piece of iron (alluded to\r\n   in Chap. IV) has touched the magnet and been attached to a light\r\n   piece of wood or stalk and then placed in a vessel of water,\r\n   one part will be turned towards the mariner’s star because it\r\n   is near the pole, “the fact being that it does not turn towards\r\n   the aforesaid star but towards the pole.” That end of the iron\r\n   which has touched the Southern end of the stone turns towards\r\n   the Northern quarter of the sky, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n   Chap. VIII. If you wish to attract iron floating on water, hold\r\n   the Southern part of a loadstone to the Northern part of the\r\n   iron and the iron will follow. But, if you bring the North end\r\n   of the stone near the North end of the iron, the latter will\r\n   avoid the stone. “If, however, violence is used towards the\r\n   ends, so that, for instance, the Southern end of the iron which\r\n   was touched with the Northern end of the magnet is now touched\r\n   with the Southern end of the magnet ... the power in the iron\r\n   will easily be changed, and that will become Southern which was\r\n   previously Northern, and the converse.”\r\n\r\n   Chap. IX. “The Northern part of the magnet attracts the Southern\r\n   and the reverse, as has been shown; in which attraction the\r\n   magnet is an ‘agent’ of greater power while the ‘patient’\r\n   (_i. e._ the other which is acted upon) is, of weaker.” This\r\n   is proved by taking a loadstone--marking it, for instance,\r\n   AD--dividing, separating it into two parts, and placing one\r\n   part (the Northern, marked A, called the “agent”) into water\r\n   so that it will float. It will turn “to the North, as before,\r\n   for the division does not deprive the parts of the stone of\r\n   their properties, if it be homogeneous.” The other part (the\r\n   Southern, marked D, called the “patient”) is next to be floated\r\n   in a similar manner. When this is done, the other ends of the\r\n   two stones should be marked respectively B and C. It will then\r\n   be observed that “if the same parts are again brought near each\r\n   other, one will attract the other, so that they will be joined\r\n   together again at B and C where the division took place. Whence\r\n   it is that they become one body with the same natural propensity\r\n   as at first. The proof of this is that if they are joined\r\n   together they will possess the same oppositions (opposite poles)\r\n   they first contained. The ‘agent,’ therefore, as you will see by\r\n   experiment, intends to unite its ‘patient’ to itself, and this\r\n   takes place on account of the similitude between them.... And,\r\n   in the same way, it will happen that if A is joined with D, the\r\n   two lines will become one, by virtue of that very attraction,\r\n   in this order CD--AB ... there will then remain the identity of\r\n   the extreme parts as at first, before they were reunited, for C\r\n   will be the North point and B the South point, as B and C were\r\n   before.... It is therefore evident, from these observations,\r\n   why the Southern parts do attract the Northern, and the reverse,\r\n   and why the attraction of the South by the South, and the North\r\n   by the North, is not according to Nature.”\r\n\r\n   Chap. X. “Some weak inquirers have imagined that the power which\r\n   the magnet exercises over iron lies in those mineral places in\r\n   which the magnet is found ... but it is found in different parts\r\n   of the world.... Besides, when iron or the magnet turns towards\r\n   the Southern as well as to the Northern quarter, as is evident\r\n   from what has already been said, we are compelled to decide\r\n   that the attraction is exercised on the poles of the magnet not\r\n   only from the locality of its quarry, from which ensues the\r\n   evident result that, wheresoever a man may be, the direction\r\n   of this stone appears to his eye, according to the position of\r\n   his meridian circle. All the meridian circles, however, meet\r\n   together at the poles of the globe, wherefore it is that the\r\n   poles of the magnet receive their power from the poles of the\r\n   world. From this, it manifestly appears that the direction of\r\n   the magnet is not towards the mariner’s star, as the meridian\r\n   circles do not meet there, but all the poles, for the mariner’s\r\n   star is always found beyond the meridian circle of any region\r\n   unless it be twice in a complete revolution of the firmament.\r\n   Likewise from this, it is manifest that the parts of the magnet\r\n   receive their power from the world’s poles ... the whole\r\n   magnet from the whole heavens.”[18] Then follows a suggestive\r\n   experiment looking towards perpetual motion, by which one may\r\n   secure “a wonderful secret” and even “be saved the trouble of\r\n   having any clock.” Here, it is given that a _terrella_,\r\n   poised on its poles in the meridian, moves circularly with a\r\n   complete revolution in twenty-four hours. This is explained by\r\n   N. Cabæus in his “Phil. Magn.,” lib. iii. cap. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART II\r\n\r\n   Chap. I. He takes a round, or an ovoid magnet, and, after noting\r\n   its poles, files it between the two poles on both sides so that\r\n   it may be like a compressed sphere and thus occupy less space.\r\n   He then encloses this magnet between two light wooden capsules,\r\n   or boxes (_cassulas_) after the manner of a mirror ...\r\n   so fastened (with glue) that they cannot be opened and water\r\n   cannot enter. Then, says he, “place the capsules thus adjusted\r\n   in a large vessel full of water in which the two quarters of the\r\n   globe, viz. the South and the North, are found and marked, and\r\n   let them be indicated by a thread extending from the Northern to\r\n   the Southern part of the vessel; allow the capsules, or boxes,\r\n   to float and let there be above them a slender piece of wood in\r\n   the form (position) of a diameter. Then move this piece of wood\r\n   above the boxes until it is equidistant from the meridianal line\r\n   previously found and indicated by the thread, or is the same\r\n   (line) itself. This being done, according to the piece of wood\r\n   so situated, draw a line on the capsules, or boxes, and it will\r\n   be the perpetual meridianal line in all countries. That line,\r\n   therefore, when cut at right angles by another will be divided\r\n   in the centre and will be the line of the East and West. You\r\n   will thus have four quadrants actually marked on the capsules,\r\n   or boxes, representing the four quarters of the globe, of which\r\n   each will be divided into ninety, so that there may be in the\r\n   universe CCCLX parts (degrees) in the entire circumference of\r\n   the capsules, or boxes. Inscribe divisions on it as they were\r\n   formerly inscribed on the back of the astrolabe. There should\r\n   be, besides, a slender and light ruler above the capsules so\r\n   inscribed after the manner of the ruler on the back of the\r\n   astrolabe. Instead, however, of the sights (_pinnularum_),\r\n   should be erected at right angles two pins over the ends of the\r\n   ruler.”\r\n\r\n      This floating compass and the pivoted compass described\r\n      in the following chapter are to be found illustrated, pp.\r\n      67–77, figs. 10 and 12, at end of Part II of Bertelli\r\n      Barnabita’s Memoirs above referred to.\r\n\r\n   Chap. II. For the construction of a “better instrument and of\r\n   more certain effects” (the pivoted compass) he says: “Let there\r\n   be made a vessel of wood, brass or any other solid material\r\n   that you desire, and let it be turned in the shape of a jar\r\n   (_pixidis tornatum_) somewhat deep and tolerably large and\r\n   let a cover of transparent material, such as glass or crystal,\r\n   be fitted to it. If the whole vessel were of transparent\r\n   substance so much the better. Let there be placed in the centre\r\n   of the same vessel a slender axis of brass or silver, applying\r\n   its extremities to the two parts of the jar, that is to say (to\r\n   the) higher and lower. Let two holes be then made in the centre\r\n   of the axis facing each other at right angles. Then let a piece\r\n   of iron wire, like a needle, be passed through one of these\r\n   holes and another wire of silver or brass be passed through the\r\n   other, intersecting the iron at right angles. Let the cover at\r\n   first be divided into quadrants and each of the quadrants into\r\n   ninety parts, as was taught regarding the other instrument. Let\r\n   North and South and East and West be marked on it and let a rule\r\n   of transparent material be added to it with wires set upright at\r\n   the ends. You will approach what part of the magnet you please,\r\n   whether North or South, to the crystal until the needle moves\r\n   towards it and receives virtue from it. When this is done,\r\n   turn the vessel until one end (of the needle) stands directly\r\n   over the North in the instrument coinciding with the Northern\r\n   quarter of the sky. This being done, turn the rule to the sun,\r\n   by day, and to the stars, by night, in manner above indicated.\r\n   By means of this instrument, you will be enabled to direct your\r\n   footsteps to states and islands and to any places on the globe,\r\n   and wheresoever you may be, whether on land or on sea, so long\r\n   as their latitudes and longitudes are known to you.”\r\n\r\n   Chap. III. He constructs “a wheel which shall be constantly\r\n   in motion,” by making a very thin concave, silver case, after\r\n   the manner of a mirror, suitably perforated, around the rim\r\n   of which he inserts small iron nails, or teeth, bent closely\r\n   toward each other and which he then places upon an immovable\r\n   axis so that it may revolve easily.” He continues: “Let a silver\r\n   wire be added to this axis, fixed to it and placed between two\r\n   bowls on the end of which let a magnet be set, prepared in this\r\n   manner. Let it be rounded and its poles ascertained, as before\r\n   indicated; afterwards, let it be fashioned in the shape of an\r\n   egg with the poles intact, and let it be somewhat filed down\r\n   in two intermediate and opposite parts with the object of its\r\n   being compressed and occupying less space so that it may not\r\n   touch the inner walls ... let the magnet be placed on the wire\r\n   ... and let the North pole be somewhat inclined towards the\r\n   small teeth of the wheel so that it may exercise its power ...\r\n   so that each tooth shall arrive at the North pole and, owing\r\n   to the impetus of the wheel, shall pass it by and approach the\r\n   Southern quarter. Thus every small tooth will be in a perpetual\r\n   state of attraction and avoidance. And, in order that the wheel\r\n   may perform its duty with greater rapidity, insert, between\r\n   the cases, a small round brass or silver pebble of such size\r\n   that it may be caught between any two of the small teeth, so\r\n   that, as one part of the wheel comes uppermost, the pebble may\r\n   fall to the opposite part. Wherefore, whilst the motion of the\r\n   wheel is perpetual on one side, the same will be in the case\r\n   of the pebble on the other side, or the fall of the pebble\r\n   caught between any two of the teeth will be perpetual to the\r\n   opposite side because as it is drawn towards the centre of the\r\n   earth by its weight, it assists the motion by not suffering the\r\n   small teeth to remain at rest in front of the stone. Let there\r\n   be spaces, however, between the small teeth conveniently curved,\r\n   so as to catch the pebble as it falls in the way the present\r\n   description indicates.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Petrus Peregrinus. Facsimile of a Ms. at the\r\n  Bodleian Library, of the “Epistola de Magnete,” wherein is\r\n  described the earliest known pivoted compass.]\r\n\r\nGilbert alludes to this perpetual-motion engine as having been devised\r\nor delineated by Peregrinus after he had got the idea from others (“De\r\nMagnete,” Book II. chap. xxxv.), and says that Jerome Cardan writes\r\n(“Opera,” Batav., 1663; “De Rerum Varietate,” Book, IX. chap. xlviii.)\r\nhe could construct one out of iron and loadstone--not that he ever saw\r\nsuch a machine; that he merely offers the idea as an opinion and quotes\r\nfrom a report of the physician Antonio de Fantis of Treviso published\r\nin “Tabula generalis ac mare magnum scotice subtilitatis....”\r\n\r\nIn the “Magisterium Naturæ et Artis,” P. Francisci Tertii de Lanis,\r\nBrixiæ, 1684, Tractatus Tertius, Caput Secundum, p. 489, under\r\nProblema, I, _Motus perpetuus magnetis_, will be found allusion\r\nto the machines of (1) P. Peregrinus, as described in his epistle;\r\n(2) Taisnier; (3) Ant. de Fantis (cited by Cardan, as stated above);\r\nalso mention of those of P. Schottus, Athan. Kircherus, Hieronimus\r\nFinugius and others; the most important of these being again alluded to\r\nthroughout the third chapter of the same tract.\r\n\r\nGilbert makes further allusion to P. Peregrinus in his Book I. chap.\r\ni.; Book II. chap. xxxv.; Book III. chap. i.; Book IV. chap. i.; Book\r\nVI. chap. iv.\r\n\r\nThe Peregrinus’ Leyden manuscript (Fol. Cod. No. 227) already alluded\r\nto, Libri says (“Histoire des Sciences Mathém....” 1838, Vol. I. p.\r\n383, note), is but a poor copy of the manuscript in the Paris Library\r\n(No. 7378A), from which latter the words _Petri ad Sygerum_ have been\r\nunfortunately transformed into _Petri Adsigerii_. He adds (Vol. II. pp.\r\n70–71) that Humboldt cites (“Examen Critique,” p. 243) several authors\r\nwho have alluded to the pretended Adsigerius. Mention is also made of\r\nthe fact that W. Wenkebach, professor at the Hague Military School,\r\nexamined the manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, Nos. 1629, 1794 and\r\n2458, containing the treatise of Peregrinus, and that not one of them\r\nhas the passage alluding to the declination. The Leyden manuscript,\r\nby the way, is said to be the only one, besides the Vatican copy, No.\r\n5733, bearing the full date, which latter was first made known by\r\nThévenot in his “Recueil de Voyages.” And it was a passage found in the\r\nLeyden manuscript (Q 27) which led to the belief that Peregrinus had\r\nfirst observed the variation or declination of the magnetic needle.\r\nThe passage is as follows: “Take note that the magnet, as well as\r\nthe needle that has been touched by it, does not point exactly to the\r\npoles, but that the part of it which is supposed to point to the South\r\nsometimes declines a little to the West, and that the part which looks\r\ntowards the North sometimes inclines to the East. The exact quantity of\r\nthis declination I have ascertained, after numerous experiments, to be\r\nfive degrees. However, this declination is no obstacle to our guidance,\r\nbecause we make the needle itself decline from the true South by nearly\r\none point and a half towards the West. A point contains five degrees.”\r\nThis passage is unquestionably a late addition, being written in a\r\ndifferent hand in a circle which itself is an incompleted outline of\r\none of the figures of Peregrinus’ primitive compass.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Encyclopædia Metropolitana,” Vol. III. p. 737\r\n   (“Bibliotheca Bibliothecarum,” fol. 11, p. 1400; “Catalogue\r\n   of the MSS. in the library of Geneva,” by Senebier, p. 207);\r\n   “Bulletino di bibliographia e di storia delle scienze ...” B.\r\n   Boncompagni, Vol. I. pp. 1–32, 65–99, 101–139, 319–420; Vol. IV.\r\n   pp. 257–288, 303–331; “Cat. bibl. publicæ univers.

This is, however,\r\nsupported by no evidence, nor is any allusion whatever made to the fact\r\nin the account he rendered of his voyage. Before Marco Polo set out on\r\nhis travels, as Humboldt states, the Catalans had already made voyages\r\n“along the northern islands of Scotland as well as along the western\r\nshores of tropical Africa, while the Basques had ventured forth in\r\nsearch of the whale, and the Northmen had made their way to the Azores\r\n(the Bracir islands of Picignano).”\r\n\r\nPolo relates that he set out from Acre in 1271, and returned to Venice\r\n“in the year 1295 of Christ’s Incarnation.” His “Travels” (“Il Milione\r\ndi Messer Marco Polo”) according to the review of Col. Henry Yule,\r\nconsists of a prologue and four books. It was dictated by him to a\r\nfellow prisoner, Rusticiano or Rusticello, of Pisa, and “it would\r\nappear now to be definitely settled that the original was ... of just\r\nsuch French as we might expect in the thirteenth century from a Tuscan\r\namanuensis following the oral dictation of an Orientalized Venetian.”\r\n\r\nPolo’s journeyings extended “so far to the north that he leaves the\r\nNorth Star behind him, and thence so far to the south that the North\r\nStar is never seen.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Becquerel, “Elec. et Magn.,” Vol. I. p. 70;\r\n   Sonnini, in Buffon, “Minéraux,” Vol. VI. p. 84; Humboldt,\r\n   “Cosmos,” 1849, Vol. II. pp. 625, 656, or 1860, pp. 250–251;\r\n   “The Book of Ser Marco Polo,” by Sir Henry Yule, New York,\r\n   1903, which contains a very extensive bibliography at end of\r\n   the second volume; Libri, “Hist. des Sc.

They afterwards take a loadstone of sufficient size to fill\r\nthe palm of the hand, or even smaller; bring it to the surface of the\r\nwater, give to their hands a rotatory motion towards the right so that\r\nthe needle turns on the water’s surface; they then suddenly and quickly\r\nwithdraw their hands, when the two points of the needle face north and\r\nsouth. I have seen them, with my own eyes, do that during my voyage at\r\nsea from Tripolis to Alexandria.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--E.

This view is\r\nsupported by Briet (Philippe), “Annales Mundi,” Vol. VI: Géog. et\r\nHydrog., lib. x. cap. 8; by Voltaire (“Essai sur les Mœurs,” 1819,\r\nVol. III. chap. cxli.), and by many others, but Klaproth (“Lettre ...”\r\n1834, pp. 132–136) quotes Anthony of Bologna, called the Panormitan,\r\nas saying that Gioia lived in the fourteenth century and wrote both\r\n“_Prima dedit nautis usum magnetis Amalphis_” and “_Inventrix\r\npræclara fuit magnetis Amalphis_.” He adds that a statement to the\r\nsame effect was made by Arrigi Brechmann in his “Historia Pandectarum\r\nAmalphitorum,” Dissertatio I, No. 22, Neapoli, 1735, p. 925, but that\r\nboth are equally incorrect, for Gioja could not have invented an\r\ninstrument which had already been in use more than a hundred years\r\nbefore his time.[19]\r\n\r\nIn his “Essay on Several Important Subjects,” London, 1676, Joseph\r\nGlanvill remarks (p. 33): “I think there is more acknowledgment due to\r\nthe name of this obscure fellow, that hath scarce any left, than to a\r\nthousand Alexanders and Cæsars or to ten times the number of Aristotles\r\nand Aquinas’. And he really did more for the increase of knowledge\r\nand advantage of the world, by this one experiment, than the numerous\r\n_subtile disputers_ that have lived ever since the creation of the\r\nSchool of Wrangling.”\r\n\r\nIn the “Navigator’s Supply,” published 1597, William Barlowe speaks of\r\n“the lame tale of one Flavius at Amelphus in the Kingdome of Naples;\r\nfor to have devised it (the compass) is of very slender probabilitie.”\r\n\r\nM. D. A. Azuni says (“Boussole,” 1809, p. 144) that Gioja may have\r\npossibly invented the method of suspending the magnetic needle upon a\r\nperpendicular pivot so that it would remain horizontal whatever the\r\nmovements of the vessel. This is very likely; at any rate, it must be\r\nadmitted that this particular mode of support permits a freer movement\r\nto the needle in any direction and admits of more exact observations\r\nthan when the needle is floating upon the water.\r\n\r\nAt pp. 487–505, Vol. II of his “Histoire des Sciences Mathématiques,”\r\nGuillaume Libri transcribes all he is able to from the almost illegible\r\nPeter Peregrinus’ manuscript, No. 7378A, in the Paris Bibliothèque,\r\nand refers to the imperfect mode of suspending the magnetic needle\r\ntherein shown. It is, says he, similar to that spoken of by Francesco\r\nda Buti (Libri, Vol. II. pp. 67–68; Bertelli, “Pietro Peregrino,” pp.\r\n63–66), who makes first mention of the compass in the Dante commentary\r\n(“Comment, sopra la Divina Commedia”) to be found in the collection of\r\nmanuscripts No. 29, held by the Magliabechiana Library of Florence.\r\nHe adds that the suspension of the needle is likewise alluded to by\r\nGuerino detto il Meschino, in a work first composed prior to the\r\n“Divina Commedia” (an Italian romance, attributed to one Andrew the\r\nFlorentine) as _imbellico_, or _in bellico_, _in bilico_, meaning\r\nin suspense, throughout the editions of Padua, 1473, Bologna, 1475,\r\nMilan, 1482 and Venice, 1480, 1498.

Arouet de Voltaire,\r\nwho asserts it at Vol. III. pp. 251–252 of his “Essai sur les Mœurs et\r\nl’Esprit des Nations,” Paris, 1809, “that the first well-authenticated\r\nuse of the compass” was made by the English during this period, which\r\nis that of the reign of King Edward III.\r\n\r\nBy Voltaire, the extraordinary (_prodigieuse_) antiquity of the\r\nChinese is not questioned. They knew of the compass, but he says “it\r\nwas not employed by them for its proper use, that of guiding vessels\r\nat sea. They travelled only along the shores. Possessed, as they were,\r\nof a country that furnished everything, they did not feel the need\r\nof going, as we do, to the other end of the world” (Vol. I. pp. 239,\r\n247). Speaking of the Portuguese (Vol. III. p. 257) he says: “It was\r\nnot before known if the magnetic needle would point to the south on\r\napproaching the South Pole; it was found to point constantly to the\r\nnorth during the year 1486.”\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Edward III, the compass was known in England by the\r\nnames of _adamant_, _sailing needle_ and _sail-stone dial_, as has been\r\nshown in the writings of Chaucer and others, the most important of\r\nwhich will be duly quoted in their order. The compass was alluded to,\r\nmore particularly, by John Gower, “Confessio Amantis,”[20] Books I and\r\nVI; by Richard Hakluyt, “Voyages,” Vol. I. pp. 213, 215; and by Edward\r\nFairfax, “Godefroy de Boulogne,” Book XV. s. 18.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to record here that Voltaire was “confessedly the\r\nforemost name, the acknowledged head of European literature of his\r\ntime.” Goethe calls him “the greatest literary man of all time,\r\nthe most astonishing creation of the Author of Nature” (“Nouvelle\r\nBiographie,” Vol. XLV. i. p. 445). Though not the first French author\r\nwho wrote on the wonderful discoveries of Newton, he was the first to\r\nmake them extensively known on the Continent.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Sir Harris Nicolas, “Hist.

T. Bertelli, who has been mentioned under the A.D. 1190 date,\r\ncould not find any reference, however remote, to the directive property\r\nof the loadstone throughout a careful examination of Latin and Greek\r\nworks dating from the sixth century B.C. to the tenth century A.D.\r\nHe admits that the directive property was known to the Chinese, who\r\nhad made rude floating needle compasses before the beginning of the\r\nChristian era, although these compasses are likely to have been brought\r\nhome by the Amalfian sailors, who are, by some writers, represented as\r\nhaving substituted the pivoted needle as well as added the Rose of the\r\nWinds.[21] He will not, however, recognize the claims made in favour of\r\nFlavio Gioja. On the other hand, A. Botto has shown that the Amalfitans\r\nintroduced the compass between the tenth and the eleventh centuries\r\n(“Contributo agli studi storici sull’origine della bussola nautica,”\r\n1899). Consult likewise Vol. IX of “Annales de Géogr. et de Bibliogr.,”\r\n1899, p. 8.\r\n\r\nAt p. 195 of the December 1904 issue of “Terrestrial Magnetism” is a\r\nshort article relative to the claim made that the compass was invented\r\nby a Veronese named Salomone Ireneo Pacifico (A.D. 776–846) during the\r\nfirst half of the ninth century. It states that Bertelli considers this\r\ndue to a misinterpretation of an inscription on Pacifico’s tomb, and\r\nit alludes to Bertelli’s previous paper on the subject in “Terrestr.\r\nMagn.,” Vol. VIII. No. 4, p. 179 (see also the number of “Terrestr.\r\nMagn.” for June 1905, p. 108, and the “Geographical Journal” for March\r\n1905, pp. 334–335).\r\n\r\nThe earliest recorded use of the compass in a Spanish vessel, according\r\nto Capmany (“Memorias Historicas,” 1792), is to be found in the\r\nChronicle of Don Pedro Niño, Conde de Buelna, as follows: “It is\r\nreported that Conde’s galleys left the island of La Alharina along the\r\ncoast of Bombay ... and the pilots compared their needles which had\r\nbeen rubbed with the magnet stone....”\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Plumptre’s notes on Dante, reference is made to the fact that\r\nthe European knowledge of the magnetic needle came from Arabia, and,\r\nlike Humboldt, he quotes in support thereof an allusion from the\r\nSpanish “Leyes de las Partidas” belonging to the first half of the\r\nthirteenth century. The passage in the last named is spoken of by M.\r\nFern de Navarrete in his “Discurso historico,” etc., 1802 (II. tit. ix.\r\nley 28) and reads thus: “The needle which guides the seaman in the dark\r\nnight and shows him, both in good and in bad weather, how to direct his\r\ncourse is the mediatrix (_medianera_) between the loadstone (_la\r\npiedra_) and the north star....” Humboldt adds: “See the passage in\r\n‘Las siete Partidas del sabio Rey Don Alonso el IX’ [according to the\r\nusually adopted chronological order, Alfonso the tenth], Madrid, 1829,\r\nVol. I. p. 473.”[22]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the knowledge of the compass by the Arabs in the\r\nthirteenth century has been most decidedly contested by E. Renaudot\r\n(“Anciennes Relations des Indes et de la Chine,” Paris, 1717, p. 3);\r\nby D. A. Azuni (“Dissertation sur l’origine de la Boussole,” Paris,\r\n1809, pp. 102, 127); by Giovanni Battista Ramusio (“Coll. Voy.,” 1554,\r\nVol. I. p. 379); by A. Collina (“Considerazioni,” etc., Faenza, 1748,\r\np. 121, etc.). Buffon says (“Théorie de la Terre,” Paris, An. VIII.\r\ntome i. p. 300): “I know that some pretend the Arabs have invented\r\nthe compass and have used it long before the French (see ‘Abrégé de\r\nl’histoire des Sarrazins,’ de Bergeron, p. 119) ... but that opinion\r\nalways appeared to me devoid of reason; for there is no word in the\r\nArabian, Turkish or Persian tongue which can be made to signify the\r\ncompass.... They employ the Italian word _bossola_....”\r\n\r\nThe same view is entertained by Dr. William Robertson, principal of\r\nthe University of Edinburgh, who, after announcing in his “History\r\nof the Reign of Charles V,” London, 1769, Vol. I. p. 78, that the\r\nmariner’s compass was invented soon after the close of the Holy War,\r\ngives at pp. 333–335 of his “Historical Disquisition,” London, 1812,\r\na translation of the above passage taken from an early edition of\r\nthat illustrious French naturalist George Louis Le Clerc, Comte de\r\nBuffon. Robertson adds: “This shows that the knowledge of this useful\r\ninstrument was communicated to them (the Arabs) by the Europeans. There\r\nis not one single observation of ancient date made by the Arabians on\r\nthe variation of the needle, or any instruction deduced from it for the\r\nassistance of navigators.... When Mr. Niehbuhr was at Cairo, he found a\r\nmagnetic needle in the possession of a Mohammedan which served to point\r\nout the _Kaaba_, and gave it the name of _el magnetis_, a\r\nclear proof of its European origin.”\r\n\r\nThe claims of France to the discovery of the compass have been laid\r\nby some to the fact that the north point of the early instruments\r\nwas generally drawn in the form of a _fleur de lys_, but Voltaire\r\nsays (“Essai,” etc., Vol. III. p. 251), that the Italians drew this\r\nin honour of the sovereigns of Naples, a branch of the French royal\r\nfamily. The able writer in the English Cyclopædia (“Arts and Sciences,”\r\nVol. III. p. 102) considers the design to be only “an _ornamented\r\ncross_ which originated in devotion to the mere symbol; though, as the\r\ncompass undoubtedly came, he says, into Europe from the Arabs, the\r\n_fleur de lys_ might possibly be a modification of the _mouasala_, or\r\ndart, the name by which the Arabs called the needle” (“Phil.

The\r\nknowledge of the latter, which is so indispensable to the correction of\r\na ship’s reckoning, was then ascertained less by the sun’s rising and\r\nsetting than by the polar star.\r\n\r\nOne of Bianco’s charts, now in the Biblioteca Marciana, Venice, shows\r\ntwo islands at the West of the Azores, leading many to believe that he\r\npossessed some knowledge of the existence of North and South America.\r\n\r\nIn Justin Winsor’s description of Dr. John G. Kohl’s collection of\r\nearly maps (“Harvard Univ. Bulletin,” Vol. III. pp. 175–176), it is\r\nsaid that the original of Andrea Bianco’s Map of the World A.D. 1436,\r\nnow at Venice, was reproduced by Joachim Lelewell (“Géographie du Moyen\r\nAge,” Pl. XXXII), and also in M. F. de Barros de Santarem’s “Essai\r\nsur l’histoire de la cosmographie et de la cartographie” (Pls. XXIII,\r\nXLIII).[23] Reference is also made thereto in Winsor’s “Bibliography of\r\nPtolemy’s Geography,” sub anno 1478. Mr. Winsor adds: “Bianco’s views\r\nare of interest in early American cartography from the deductions which\r\nsome have drawn from the configuration of the islands ‘Antillia’ and\r\n‘De la man Satanaxio’--(two islands on its western verge)--that they\r\nrepresent Pre-Columbian discovery of South and North America.” Humboldt\r\n(“Crit. Untersuchungen,” I. 413, 416) has discussed the question, and\r\npointed out that one island, “Antillia,” had earlier appeared on a map\r\nof 1425, and D’Avezac finds even earlier references to the same island.\r\n\r\nTo Andrea Bianco may be ascribed the best of all known forms of\r\nwind-roses. Admiral L. Fincati illustrates, in his well-known pamphlet\r\n“Il Magnete, la Calamita e la Bussola,” Rome, 1878, all the best-known\r\nexamples from 1426 to 1612, those of Bianco having upon them either\r\nthe _fleur de lys_ (referred to at A.D. 1327–1377) or the letter\r\n=T=[symbol], or designs of a triangle or trident, to indicate the\r\nnorth, whilst the east is designated by a cross, in same manner as\r\nshown in the 1426 Giraldi and the Oliva 1612–1613.[24]\r\n\r\nFor other forms and accounts of these rose-of-the-winds or compass\r\ncards, it would be well to consult more particularly Nordenskiöld,\r\nNils Adolf Erik (1832–1901), “Periplus” (1897), as well as his\r\n“Facsimile Atlas” published eight years previously; Pedro de Medina,\r\n“Arte de Navegar”; Francesco Da Buti, “Comment, sopra la Div.

(Livio Sanuto, “Geographia\r\ndistincta in XII libri ...” wherein the whole of Book I is given to\r\nreported observations of the compass and to accounts of different\r\nnavigators.)\r\n\r\nColumbus did not, as many imagine, make the first observations of the\r\nexistence of magnetic variation, for this is set down upon the charts\r\nof Andrea Bianco, but he was the first who remarked, on the 13th of\r\nSeptember, 1492, that “2½ degrees east of the island of Corvo, in\r\nthe Azores, the magnetic variation changed and passed from N.E. to\r\nN.W.” Washington Irving thus describes the discovery (“History ... Ch.\r\nColumbus,” Paris, 1829, Vol. I. p. 198): “On the 13th of September, in\r\nthe evening, being about two hundred leagues from the island of Ferro\r\n(the smallest of the Canaries), Columbus, for the first time, noticed\r\nthe variation of the needle, a phenomenon which had never before been\r\nremarked. He perceived, about nightfall, that the needle, instead of\r\npointing to the North Star, varied about half a point, or between five\r\nand six degrees to the north-west, and still more on the following\r\nmorning. Struck with this circumstance, he observed it attentively\r\nfor three days and found that the variation increased as he advanced.\r\nHe at first made no mention of this phenomenon, knowing how ready his\r\npeople were to take alarm; but it soon attracted the attention of the\r\npilots, and filled them with consternation. It seemed as if the laws\r\nof nature were changing as they advanced, and that they were entering\r\ninto another world, subject to unknown influences (Las Casas, ‘Hist.\r\nInd.,’ l. i. c. 6). They apprehended that the compass was about to lose\r\nits mysterious virtues; and, without that guide, what was to become\r\nof them in a vast and trackless ocean? Columbus tasked his science\r\nand ingenuity for reasons with which to allay their terrors. He told\r\nthem that the direction of the needle was not to the polar star but\r\nto some fixed and invisible point. The variation, therefore, was not\r\ncaused by any fallacy in the compass, but by the movement of the North\r\nStar itself, which, like the other heavenly bodies, had its changes\r\nand revolutions, and every day described a circle around the pole. The\r\nhigh opinion that the pilots entertained of Columbus as a profound\r\nastronomer gave weight to his theory, and their alarm subsided.”\r\n\r\nHumboldt says: “We can, with much certainty, fix upon three places in\r\nthe _Atlantic line of no declination_ for the 13th of September,\r\n1492, the 21st of May, 1496 and the 16th of August, 1498.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Columbus and his Discoveries,” in the “Narrative\r\n   and Critical History of America,” by Justin Winsor, Boston,\r\n   1889, Vol. II. pp. 1–92; “Christopher Columbus, His life, work\r\n   ...” by John Boyd Thacher, 1903; Giov.

Cellarius, Riccioli and other writers\r\nassert that Behaim had, before Columbus, visited the American\r\nContinent, while Stuvenius shows, in his treatise “De vero novi orbis\r\ninventore,” that the islands of America and the strait of Magalhæns\r\nwere accurately traced upon the very celebrated globe called the\r\n“World Apple” completed by Behaim in the year 1492, and which is still\r\nto be seen in Behaim’s native city of Nürnberg.[26] (See Mr. Otto’s\r\nletter to Dr. Franklin, in the second volume of the “Transactions of\r\nthe American Philosophical Society held at Philadelphia for promoting\r\nuseful knowledge,” likewise Humboldt, “Examen critique de l’histoire\r\nde la Géographie,” Vol. II. pp. 357–369; “The Reliquary,” London,\r\nVol. VI.

Nothing is to be found regarding way-measurers\r\nin the literature of the Middle Ages until we come to the period of\r\nseveral “books of nautical instruction,” written or printed by this\r\nsame Pigafetta (“Trattato di Navigazione,” probably before 1530); by\r\nFrancisco Falero, a brother of Ruy Falero, the astronomer (“Regimiento\r\npara observar la longitud en la mar,” 1535); by Pedro da Medina, of\r\nSeville (“Arte de Navegar,” 1545); by Martin Cortez, of Bujalaroz\r\n(“Breve Compendio de la esfera, y de la arte de navegar,” 1551), and by\r\nAndres Garcia de Cespedes (“Regimiento de Navigacion y Hidrografia,”\r\n1606). From almost all these works--some of which, if not all, have\r\nnaturally become very scarce--as well as from the “Summa de Geografia”\r\nwhich Martin Fernandez de Enciso had published in 1519, we learn most\r\ndistinctly that the “distance sailed over” was then ascertained in\r\nSpanish and Portuguese ships not by any distinct measurement, but\r\nonly through estimation of the eye, according to certain established\r\nprinciples. Medina says (lib. iii. caps. 11–12): “In order to know\r\nthe course of the ship, as to the length of distance passed over,\r\nthe pilot must set down in his register how much distance the vessel\r\nhath made according to hours (_i. e._ guided by the hour-glass,\r\n_ampoleta_); and, for this, he must know that the most a ship\r\nadvances in an hour is four miles, and, with feebler breezes, three\r\nor only two.” Cespedes, in his “Regimiento” (pp. 99 and 156) calls\r\nthis mode of proceeding _echar punto por fantasia_, and he justly\r\nremarks that if great errors are to be avoided, this _fantasia_\r\nmust depend on the pilot’s knowledge of the qualities of his ship.\r\nColumbus, Juan de la Cosa, Sebastian Cabot and Vasco da Gama, were\r\nnot acquainted with the log and its mode of application, and they all\r\nestimated the ship’s speed merely by the eye, while they ascertained\r\nthe distance they had made merely through the running down of the sand\r\nin the glasses known as _ampoletas_.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--For F.

For\r\nexample, the Portuguese navigator Roderigues de Lazos--Lagos--takes\r\nit to be one-half point off the Island of St. Helena; the Dutch, in\r\ntheir nautical journal, make it one point there; Kendall, an expert\r\nEnglish navigator, makes it only one-sixth of a point, using a true\r\nmeridional compass. Diego Alfonso finds no variation at a point a\r\nlittle south-east of Cape das Agulhas,[27] and, by the astrolabe, shows\r\nthat the compass points due north and south at Cape das Agulhas if it\r\nbe of the Portuguese style, in which the variation is one-half point to\r\nthe south-east.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Azuni, “Boussole,” p. 121; Klaproth, “Boussole,” p.\r\n   64; Knight, “Mech.

This may be proved as\r\nfollows: I make a needle a finger long, which stands horizontally on a\r\npointed pivot, so that it nowhere inclines toward the earth, but stands\r\nhorizontal on both sides; but, as soon as I stroke one of the ends\r\n(with the loadstone) it matters not which end it be, then the needle\r\nno longer stands horizontal, but points downward (_fällt unter sich_)\r\nsome nine degrees, more or less. The reason why this happens I was not\r\nable to indicate to his Royal Majesty.” The above seems to establish\r\nthe fact that Hartmann first observed the dip of the magnetic needle\r\nindependently of Robert Norman.\r\n\r\nGilbert refers (“De Magnete,” Book I. chap. i.) to Fortunius\r\nAffaitatus--Affaydatus--an Italian physicist who, says he, has some\r\nrather silly philosophizing about the attraction of iron and of its\r\nturning to the poles, thus alluding to the latter’s small work called\r\n“Physicæ (et) ac astronomiæ (astronomicæ) considerationes,” which\r\nappeared at Venice in 1549.

In this book, Gilbert says (“De Magnete,”\r\nlib. i. cap. 1) allusion is made to a certain magnetic island and to\r\nmountains in the north possessing such power of attraction that ships\r\nhave to be constructed with wooden pegs so that as they sail by the\r\nmagnetic cliffs there be no iron nails to draw out.\r\n\r\nTo this, reference is made by Thos. Browne (“Pseud.

Of these\r\nexperiments, he gives a full account in his “Magiæ Naturalis,” the\r\nfirst edition of which is said to have been published at Naples when\r\nPorta was but fifteen years of age (“Encycl. Brit.,” article “Optics”).\r\nProf. Stanley Jones says this is the earliest work in which he has\r\nfound allusions to a magnetic telegraph.\r\n\r\nPorta’s observations are so extraordinary--and they attracted so much\r\nattention as to justify eighteen separate editions of his work in\r\ndifferent languages prior to the year 1600--that extracts must needs\r\nhere prove interesting. They are taken out of “Natural Magick in XX\r\nBookes by John Baptist Porta, a Neapolitaine ... London 1658,” the\r\nseventh book of which treats “Of the wonders of the loadstone.”\r\n\r\n_Proem_: “And to a friend that is at a far distance from us and\r\nfast shut up in prison, we may relate our minds; which I doubt not may\r\nbe done by two mariner’s compasses, having the alphabet writ about them\r\n...”\r\n\r\nChap. I (alluding to the loadstone):\r\n\r\n    “The Greeks do call it _Magnes_ from the place,\r\n    For that the Magnet’s hand it doth embrace.”\r\n\r\nNicander thinks the stone was so called--and so doth Pliny--from one\r\n_Magnes_, a shepherd.\r\n\r\nIn Chap. XVIII he states that “the situation makes the Vertues of the\r\nStone contrary ... for the stone put above the table will do one thing,\r\nand another thing if it be put under the table ... that part that\r\ndrew above will drive off beneath; and that will draw beneath that\r\ndrove off above: that is, if you place the stone above and beneath in a\r\nperpendicular.”\r\n\r\nIn Chap. XXV, in allusion to “a long concatenation of iron rings,” he\r\nthus quotes Lucretius:\r\n\r\n    “A stone there is that men admire much\r\n    That makes rings hang in chains by touch.\r\n    Sometimes five or six links will be\r\n    Fast joyn’d together and agree.\r\n    All this vertue from the Stone ariseth,\r\n    Such force it hath ...”\r\n\r\nChap. XXVII alludes to the Statue hung by Dinocrates: “... but that is\r\nfalse, that Mahomet’s chest hangs by the roof of the Temple. Petrus\r\nPellegrinus saith, he shewed in another work how that might be done:\r\nbut that work is not to be found.... But I say it may be done--because\r\nI have now done it--to hold it fast by an invisible band, to hang in\r\nthe air: onely so, that it be bound with a small thread beneath, that\r\nit may not rise higher: and then striving to catch hold of the stone\r\nabove, it will hang in the air, and tremble and wag itself.”\r\n\r\nIn Chap. XXVIII he says that “Whilst the loadstone is moved under a\r\ntable of wood, stone or any metal, except iron, the needle in the\r\nmariner’s compass will move above, as if there is no body between them.\r\nSt. Augustine (‘Liber de Civitate Dei’) knew this experiment (likewise\r\nalluded to by Camillus Leonardus in his ‘Speculum Lapidum,’ published\r\n1502). But that is much more wonderful that I have heerd: that if one\r\nhold a loadstone under a piece of silver, and put a piece of iron above\r\nthe silver, as he moves his hand underneath that holds the stone, so\r\nwill the iron move above; and the silver being in the middle, and\r\nsuffering nothing, running so swiftly up and down, that the stone was\r\npulled from the hand of the man, and took hold of the iron.”\r\n\r\nChap. XXX is headed: “A loadstone on a plate of iron, will not stir\r\niron,” and he again quotes Lucretius:\r\n\r\n    “Pieces of iron I have seen\r\n    When onely brass was put between\r\n    Them and the Loadstone, to recoil:\r\n    Brass in the middle made this broil.”\r\n\r\nIn Chap. XXXII he tells us that an Italian “whose name was Amalphus\r\n... knew not the Mariner’s Card, but stuck the needle in a reed, or a\r\npiece of wood, cross over: and he put the needles into a vessel full of\r\nwater that they might flote freely: then carrying about the loadstone,\r\nthe needles would follow it: which being taken away, as by a certain\r\nnatural motion, the points of the needles would turn to the north\r\npole: and, having found that, stand still.... Now the Mariner’s Compass\r\nis made, and a needle touched with the Loadstone, is so fitted to it,\r\nthat, by discovering the pole by it, all other parts of the heavens are\r\nknown. There is made a rundle with a Latin-navel upon a point of the\r\nsame metal, that it may run roundly freely. Whereupon, by the touching\r\nonely of one end, the needle not alone partakes of the vertues of it,\r\nbut of the other end also, whether it will or not....”\r\n\r\nChap. XLVIII is headed “Whether Garlick can hinder the vertues of the\r\nloadstone.” By Porta we are informed that “Plutarch saith Garlick is at\r\ngreat enmity with the loadstone; and such antipathy and hatred there\r\nis between these invisible creatures, that if a loadstone be smeered\r\nwith Garlick, it will drive away iron from it,” which is confirmed by\r\nPtolemy, who states “that the loadstone will not draw iron, if it be\r\nanoynted with Garlick; as Amber will no more draw straws, and other\r\nlight things to it, if they be first steeped in oyl.” He found that\r\nwhen the loadstone “was all anoynted over the juice of Garlick, it did\r\nperform its office as well as if it had never been touched with it.”\r\n\r\nIn Chap. LIII Porta denies “that the diamond doth hinder the\r\nloadstone’s vertue.” “Some pretend,” says he, “there is so much discord\r\nbetween the qualities of the loadstone and the diamond, and they are so\r\nhateful, one against the other, and secret enemies, that if the diamond\r\nbe put to the loadstone, it presently faints and loses all its forces.\r\n(Pliny.) The loadstone so disagreeth with the diamond, that if iron be\r\nlaid by it, it will not let the loadstone draw it; and if the loadstone\r\ndo attract it, it will snatch it away again from it. (St. Augustine.)\r\nI will say that I have read of the loadstone: how that, if the diamond\r\nbe by it, it will not draw iron; and, if it do when it comes neer the\r\ndiamond, it will let it fall” (Marbodeus, of the Loadstone ... Marbodei\r\nGalli ... de lapidibus pretiosis Enchiridion ... Freiburg, 1530, 1531):\r\n\r\n    “All loadstones by their vertue iron draw;\r\n    But of the diamond it stands in awe:\r\n    Taking the iron from’t by Nature’s Law.”\r\n\r\n“I tried this often, and found it false; and that there is no truth in\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nWith reference to the above, see Plat (at A.D. 1653), who also\r\nalludes to the fact of the softening of the diamond with Goat’s blood.\r\nThis is alluded to by Porta in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nChapter LIV contains extracts from Castianus in Geoponic.

Five years later (1581) Norman\r\npublishes a pamphlet “The Newe Attractive, containing a short discourse\r\nof the Magnes or Lodestone, and amongest other his vertues, of a newe\r\ndiscouered secret, and subtill propertie concernyng the Declinyng of\r\nthe Needle, touched therewith, under the Plaine of the Horizon ...”\r\nfrom which is taken the following:\r\n\r\n“Hauing made many and diuers compasses and using alwaies to finish and\r\nend them before I touched the needle, I found continuallie that after I\r\nhad touched the yrons with the stone, that presentlie the north point\r\nthereof woulde bend or decline downwards under the horizon in some\r\nquantitie; in so much that to the flie of the compass, which was before\r\nlevell, I was still constrained to put some small piece of ware on the\r\nsouth point and make it equall againe ...” (Weld, “History of the Royal\r\nSociety,” 1848, Vol. II. p. 432).\r\n\r\nIn the fourth chapter of his work, Norman describes the mode of making\r\nthe particular instrument with which he was enabled to establish the\r\nfirst accurate measurement of the dip “which for this citie of London,\r\nI finde, by exact obseruations to be about 71 degrees 50 mynutes.”\r\n\r\nWhewell thus alludes to several investigations in the same line:\r\n\r\n“Other learned men have, in long navigations, observed the differences\r\nof magnetic variations, as Thomas Hariot, Robert Hues, Edward Wright,\r\nAbraham Kendall, all Englishmen: others have invented magnetic\r\ninstruments and convenient modes of observation such as are requisite\r\nfor those who take long voyages, as William Borough, in his book\r\nconcerning the variation of the compass; William Barlo, in his\r\n‘Supplement’; Robert Norman, in his ‘Newe Attractive.’ This is that\r\nRobert Norman (a good seaman and an ingenious artificer) who first\r\ndiscovered the _dip_ of magnetic iron” (“Enc. Metr.,” p. 738; read\r\nalso paragraph 366 of J. F. W. Herschel’s “Prelim. Disc.,” 1855).\r\n\r\nIn Book I. chap. i. of Gilbert’s “De Magnete,” he says that Norman\r\nposits a point and place toward which the magnet looks but whereto\r\nit is not drawn: toward which magnetized iron, according to him, is\r\ncollimated but which does not attract it. He alludes again to this\r\n“respective point” (Book IV. chaps. i. and vi.), saying that Norman\r\noriginated the idea of the “respective point” looking, as it were,\r\ntoward hidden principles, and held that toward this the magnetized\r\nneedle ever turns, and not toward any attractional point: but he was\r\ngreatly in error, albeit he exploded the ancient false opinion about\r\nattraction. Gilbert then proceeds to show how this theory is proved by\r\nNorman. The original passage in Norman’s “Newe Attractive” (London,\r\n1581, Chap. VI) is as follows:\r\n\r\n“Your reason towards the earth carrieth some probabilitie, but I prove\r\nthat there be no _Attractive_, or drawing propertie in neyther of these\r\ntwo partes, then is the _Attractive_ poynt lost, and falsly called\r\nthe poynt _Attractive_, as shall be proved. But because there is a\r\ncertain poynt that the needle alwayes respecteth or sheweth, being\r\nvoide and without any _Attractive_ propertie: in my judjment this\r\npoynt ought rather to bee called the poynt _Respective_.... This poynt\r\n_Respective_, is a certayne poynt, which the touched needle doth always\r\n_Respect_ or shew....”\r\n\r\nFor the means of determining the _dip or inclination_, see “English\r\nEncy.”--Arts and Sciences--Vol. VIII. p. 160.\r\n\r\nWe have thus far learned that the _declination or variation_ was\r\nalluded to by Peter Peregrinus (A.D. 1269) in the Leyden MS.; that\r\nNorman was the first to determine the _dip or inclination_, and we\r\nshall, under the 1776 date, find that Borda determined the third\r\nmagnetic element called the _intensity_.\r\n\r\nIn 1581 appeared “The newe attractive ... a discours of the variation\r\nof the cumpas ... made by W. B(orough).” This was followed, in 1585 and\r\nin 1596, by “The newe Attractive ... newly corrected and amended by M.\r\nW. B.,” also, in 1614, by “The New Attractive, with the application\r\nthereof for finding the true variation of the compass, by W. Burrowes.”\r\n\r\nNorman is also the author of “The safegarde of Saylers, or Great Rutter\r\n... translated out of Dutch ... by R.

So that although certain\r\nproperties of the loadstone were knowne before, yet all the reasons of\r\nthose properties were vtterly vnknowne and never before revealed (as I\r\ntake it) vnto the sonnes of man....” Just before the Preface appears\r\nthe following letter which (as William Sturgeon remarks) affords a good\r\nidea of the opinion entertained by Gilbert of Barlowe’s talents in this\r\nbranch of science: “To the Worshipfull, my good friend, Mr. William\r\nBarlow, at Easton by Winchester.

We are here introduced to Gilbert’s\r\n_versorium_--a rotating needle electroscope[33]--and are given the\r\nresults of his many experimental observations[34] and the opinions of\r\nothers relative to magnetic coition or attraction. We find, throughout\r\nthe whole of the second chapter, the first systematic study of amber,\r\nwith an interesting list of electrics and the recognition of a group of\r\nanelectrics--non-electrics. After pointing out the different kinds of\r\nattractions admitted by Galen and other ancient writers, we are told\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n   “Only feeble power of attraction is possessed by some electrics\r\n   (all which have their own distinct effluvia) in favouring dry\r\n   atmosphere: observable in midwinter while the atmosphere is very\r\n   cold, clear and thin, when the electric effluvia of the earth\r\n   offer less impediment and electric bodies are harder--that these\r\n   bodies then draw, as well, all metals, wood, leaves, stones,\r\n   earths, even water and oil, in short, whatever things appeal to\r\n   our senses or are solid.\r\n\r\n   “All bodies are attracted by electrics, save those which are\r\n   afire or flaming or extremely rarefied.\r\n\r\n   “Very many electric bodies do not attract at all, unless they\r\n   are first rubbed. An ordinary piece of amber does not attract by\r\n   heat, even when brought to the flaming point, but it attracts by\r\n   friction, without which latter few bodies give out their true\r\n   natural electric emanation and effluvium. By friction, the amber\r\n   is made moderately hot and also smooth; these conditions must\r\n   in most cases concur; but a large polished piece of amber or of\r\n   jet attracts even without friction, though not so strongly; yet,\r\n   if it be carefully brought nigh to a flame or a red coal, it\r\n   does not attract corpuscles; further, the sun’s heat heightened\r\n   by means of a burning-glass imparts no power to amber, for it\r\n   dissipates and spoils all the electric effluvia. Again, flaming\r\n   sulphur and burning sealing-wax (of lac) do not attract.\r\n\r\n   “The loadstone, though susceptible of very high polish, has not\r\n   the electric attraction. The force does not come through the\r\n   lustre proceeding from the rubbed and polished electric; for the\r\n   vincentina, diamond and pure glass attract when they are rough.\r\n   Effluvia that attract but feebly when the weather is clear\r\n   produce no motion at all when it is cloudy. For the effluvium\r\n   from rock crystal, glass, diamond--substances very hard and\r\n   very highly compressed--there is no need of any notable outflow\r\n   of substance. Such an electric as sound cypress-wood, after a\r\n   moment’s friction, emits powers subtle and fine, far beyond all\r\n   odours; but sometimes an odour is also emitted by amber, jet,\r\n   sulphur, these bodies being more readily resolved; hence it is\r\n   that, usually, they attract after the gentlest friction because\r\n   their effluvia are stronger and more lasting.\r\n\r\n   “Rock crystal, mica, glass, and other electric bodies do not\r\n   attract if they be burned or highly heated, for their primordial\r\n   humour is destroyed by the heat, is altered, is discharged as\r\n   vapour. All bodies that derive their origin principally from\r\n   humours and that are firmly concreted attract all substances\r\n   whether humid or dry; but bodies consisting mostly of humour\r\n   and not firmly compacted by nature, wherefore they do not stand\r\n   friction but either fall to pieces or grow soft or are sticky,\r\n   do not attract corpuscles.\r\n\r\n   “Electrical movements come from the matter (_materia_)\r\n   but magnetic from the prime form (_forma_). Moist air\r\n   blown from the mouth, moisture from steam, or a current of\r\n   humid air from the atmosphere chokes the effluvium. But olive\r\n   oil that is light and pure does not prevent it; and, if a sheet\r\n   of paper or a linen cloth be interposed, there is no movement.\r\n   But loadstone, neither rubbed nor heated, and even though it be\r\n   thoroughly drenched with liquid, and whether in air or water,\r\n   attracts magnetic bodies, and that though solidest bodies or\r\n   boards or thick slabs of stone or plates of metal stand between.\r\n\r\n   “Electrics attract all things save flame and objects aflame, and\r\n   thinnest air ... for it is plain that the effluvia are consumed\r\n   by flame and igneous heat ... yet they draw to themselves the\r\n   smoke from an extinguished candle; and, the lighter the smoke\r\n   becomes as it ascends, the less strongly is it attracted, for\r\n   substances that are too rare do not suffer attraction.”\r\n\r\nThis Chapter II ends with the following explanation of the difference\r\nbetween electric and magnetic bodies, viz. all magnetic bodies\r\ncome together by their joint forces (mutual strength); electric\r\nbodies attract the electric only, and the body attracted undergoes\r\nno modification through its own native force, but is drawn freely\r\nunder impulsion in the ratio of its matter (composition). Bodies\r\nare attracted to electrics in a right line toward the centre of\r\nelectricity: a loadstone approaches another loadstone on a line\r\nperpendicular to the circumference only at the poles, elsewhere\r\nobliquely and transversely, and adheres at the same angles. The\r\nelectric motion is the motion of conservation of matter; the magnetic\r\nis that of arrangement and order. The matter of the earth’s globe is\r\nbrought together and held together by itself electrically. The earth’s\r\nglobe is directed and revolves magnetically; it both coheres, and, to\r\nthe end it may be solid, it is in its interior fast joined.\r\n\r\nOf the other interesting chapters in this Book II, attention is called\r\nmore particularly to:\r\n\r\n   Chap. IV. “Of the strength of a loadstone and its form: the\r\n   cause of coition.” The magnetic nature is proper to the earth\r\n   and is implanted in all its real parts ... there is in the\r\n   earth a magnetic strength or energy (_vigour_) of its own ...\r\n   thus we have to treat of the earth, which is a magnetic body,\r\n   a loadstone. An iron rod held in the hand is magnetized in the\r\n   end where it is grasped and the magnetic force travels to the\r\n   other extremity, not along the surface only but through the\r\n   inside, through the middle.... Iron instantly receives from\r\n   the loadstone verticity and natural conformity to it, being\r\n   absolutely metamorphosed into a perfect magnet. As soon as it\r\n   comes within the loadstone’s sphere of influence it changes\r\n   instantly and has its form renewed, which before was dormant and\r\n   inert, but now is quick and active.\r\n\r\n   Chaps. VI and XXVII illustrate the _Orbis Virtutis_ (Orb of\r\n   Virtue, or the magnetic atmosphere surrounding both earth\r\n   and loadstone alike), showing how the earth and loadstone\r\n   conform magnetic movements, the centre of the magnetic forces\r\n   of the earth being the earth’s centre and in the terrella the\r\n   terrella’s centre. All loadstones alike, whether spherical or\r\n   oblong, have the selfsame mode of turning to the poles of the\r\n   world ... whatever the shape, verticity is present and there are\r\n   poles.\r\n\r\n   Chap. VII. “Of the potency of the magnetic force, and of its\r\n   spherical extension.” The magnetic energy is not hindered by any\r\n   dense or opaque body, but goes out freely and diffuses its force\r\n   every whither: in the case of the terrella, and in a spherical\r\n   loadstone, it extends outside the body in a circle, but, in the\r\n   case of an oblong loadstone, it extends into an area of form\r\n   determined by the shape of, and is everywhere equidistant from,\r\n   the stone itself.\r\n\r\n   Chap. XIII. “Of the magnetic axis and poles.”\r\n\r\n   Chap. XV. “The magnetic force imparted to iron is more apparent\r\n   in an iron rod than in an iron sphere or cube, or iron in any\r\n   other shape.”\r\n\r\n   Chap. XVI. “Motion is produced by the magnetic force through\r\n   solid bodies interposed: of the interposition of a plate of\r\n   iron.”\r\n\r\n   Chaps. XVII-XXII. Herein are detailed as many as twelve\r\n   different experiments to prove the increased efficiency of armed\r\n   loadstones.\r\n\r\n   Chap. XXV. “Intensifying the loadstone’s forces.” Magnetic\r\n   bodies can restore soundness (when not totally lost) to magnetic\r\n   bodies, and can give to some of them powers greater than they\r\n   originally had; but to those that are by their nature in the\r\n   highest degree perfect, it is not possible to give further\r\n   strength.\r\n\r\n   Chap. XXVIII. “A loadstone does not attract to a fixed point\r\n   or pole only, but to every part of a terrella, except the\r\n   equinoctial line.”\r\n\r\n   Chap. XXIX. “Of differences of forces dependent on quantity or\r\n   mass.” Four experiments.\r\n\r\n   Chaps. XXXVIII and XXXIX are the last, and they treat of the\r\n   attractions of other bodies and of mutually repellant bodies.\r\n   All electrics attract objects of every kind: they never repel or\r\n   propel.\r\n\r\n   In the preceding Chapter XXXV, Gilbert had alluded to the\r\n   perpetual-motion engine actuated by the attraction of a\r\n   loadstone, which we have given an account of at Peter\r\n   Peregrinus, A.D. 1269.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK III\r\n\r\nIn this Third Book, we learn of the directive (or versorial) force\r\nwhich is called _verticitas_--verticity--what it is, how it\r\nresides in the loadstone, and how it is acquired when not naturally\r\nproduced; how iron acquires it and how this verticity is lost or\r\naltered; why iron magnetized takes opposite verticity; of magnetizing\r\nstones of different shapes; why no other bodies save the magnetic\r\nare imbued with verticity by friction with a loadstone and why no\r\nbody which is not magnetic can impart and awaken that force; of\r\ndisagreements between pieces of iron on the same pole of a loadstone,\r\nand how they may come together and be conjoined; that verticity exists\r\nin all smelted iron not excited by the loadstone, as shown by its\r\nlying, being placed--or, preferably, by hammering hot iron--in the\r\nmagnetic meridian; that the magnetized needle turns to conformity with\r\nthe situation of the earth; of the use of rotary needles and their\r\nadvantages; how the directive iron rotary needles of sundials and the\r\nneedles of the mariner’s compass are to be rubbed with loadstone in\r\norder to acquire stronger verticity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK IV\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Book treats of the variation at different places; says that\r\nit is due to inequality among the earth’s elevations;[35] shows that\r\nvariation and direction are due to the controlling force of the earth\r\nand the rotatory magnetic nature, not by an attraction or a coition or\r\nby other occult cause; explains the different modes of constructing the\r\nmariner’s compass, in vogue at the time,[36] and how the deviation of\r\nthe needle is greater or less according to the distance of place.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK V\r\n\r\nIn this Fifth Book is to be found everything relative to the dip of the\r\nmagnetic needle, likewise the description of an instrument for showing,\r\nby the action of a loadstone, the degree of dip below the horizon in\r\nany latitude; and the announcement that the magnetic force is animate\r\nor imitates a soul; in many respects, it surpasses the human soul while\r\nthat is united to an organic body.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK VI\r\n\r\nThroughout this last Book, Gilbert glories in the Copernican theory,\r\nthe open, unquestioned, advocacy and endorsement of which according\r\nto many seems, after all, to have been the object of the work. He\r\nmaintains that the magnetic axis of the earth remains invariable; he\r\ntreats of the daily magnetic revolution of the globes, as against the\r\ntime-honoured opinion of a _primum mobile_, the fixed stars being\r\nat different distances from the earth; of the circular motion of the\r\nearth and of its primary magnetic nature, whereby her poles are made\r\ndifferent from the poles of the ecliptic, as well as of the precession\r\nof the equinoxes and of the obliquity of the zodiac.\r\n\r\nAccording to Humboldt,[37] Gilbert was the first to make use of the\r\nwords _electric_ force, _electric_ emanations, _electric_ attraction,\r\nbut, he says, there is not found in “De Magnete” either the abstract\r\nexpression _electricitas_ or the barbarous word _magnetismus_\r\nintroduced in the seventeenth century. We likewise owe to Gilbert\r\nthe words _equator_, _magneticum_, _terrella_, _versorium_ and\r\n_verticitas_, but not the word _pole_, which had before been used by P.\r\nPeregrinus and others.\r\n\r\nThe second edition of “De Magnete” appeared at Stettin in 1628,\r\n“embellished with a curious title-page in the form of a monument ...\r\nand a fantastic indication of the earliest European mariner’s compass,\r\na floated lodestone, but floating in a bowl on the sea and left behind\r\nby the ship sailing away from it.”[38]\r\n\r\nThe third edition was also published at Stettin during 1633. Gilbert\r\nleft, besides, a posthumous work, “De Mundo Nostro Sublunari\r\nPhilosophia Nova,” Amsterdam, 1651, which latter, says Prof. Robison,\r\nconsists of an attempt to establish a new system of natural philosophy\r\nupon the ruins of the Aristotelian doctrine.[39]\r\n\r\nTo give here such an analysis as Gilbert’s admirable work merits would\r\nbe impracticable, but the short review of it made by Prof. Robison\r\n(at p. 209 of his “System of Mechanical Philosophy,” London, 1822)\r\ndeserves full reproduction, as follows: “In the introduction, he\r\nrecounts all the knowledge of the ancients on the subject treated, and\r\ntheir supine inattention to what was so entirely in their hands, and\r\nthe impossibility of ever adding to the stock of useful knowledge,\r\nso long as men imagined themselves to be philosophizing, while they\r\nwere only repeating a few cant words and the unmeaning phrases of the\r\nAristotelian school. It is curious to mark the almost perfect sameness\r\nof Dr. Gilbert’s sentiments and language with those of Lord Bacon. They\r\nboth charge, in a peremptory manner, all those who pretend to inform\r\nothers, to give over their dialectic labours, which are nothing but\r\nringing changes on a few trite truths, and many unfounded conjectures,\r\nand immediately to betake themselves to experiment. He has pursued\r\nthis method on the subject of magnetism, with wonderful ardour, and\r\nwith equal genius and success; for Dr. Gilbert was possessed both\r\nof great ingenuity, and a mind fitted for general views of things.\r\nThe work contains a prodigious number and variety of experiments and\r\nobservations, collected with sagacity from the writings of others, and\r\ninstituted by himself with considerable expense and labour. It would,\r\nindeed, be a miracle if all of Dr. Gilbert’s general inferences were\r\njust, or all his experiments accurate. It was untrodden ground. But,\r\non the whole, this performance contains more real information than\r\nany writing of the age in which he lived, and is scarcely exceeded\r\nby any that has appeared since. We may hold it with justice as the\r\nfirst fruits of the Baconian or experimental philosophy.” Elsewhere,\r\nProf. Robison remarks: “It is not saying too much of this work to\r\naffirm that it contains almost everything we know of magnetism. His\r\nunwearied diligence in searching every writing on the subject and in\r\ngetting information from navigators, and his incessant occupation in\r\nexperiments, have left very few facts unknown to him. We meet with many\r\nthings in the writings of posterior inquirers, some of them of high\r\nreputation and of the present day, which are published and received as\r\nnotable discoveries, but are contained in the rich collection of Dr.\r\nGilbert.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Wm. Whewell says in his “History of the Inductive Sciences”\r\n(Vol. III. p. 49) that in the “De Magnete,” a book of only 240 pages,\r\nupon which Dr. Gilbert has been engaged for nearly eighteen years, are\r\ncontained “all the fundamental facts of the science, so fully examined,\r\nindeed, that, even at this day, we have little to add to them.”\r\n\r\nDr. John Davy remarks (“Memoirs of the Life of Sir Humphry Davy,”\r\nLondon, 1836, Vol. I. p. 309): “Gilbert’s work is worthy being\r\nstudied, and I am surprised that an English Edition (translation)\r\nof it has never been published.” He also alludes to the well-known\r\nreproach thrown upon Gilbert’s philosophy by Francis Bacon, who, in\r\nhis “De Augmentis Scientiarum,” observes that “Gilbert has attempted\r\nto raise a general system upon the magnet, endeavouring to build a\r\nship out of materials not sufficient to make the rowing-pins of a\r\nboat.” On the other hand, Digby and Barlowe place Gilbert upon a level\r\nwith Harvey, Galileo, Gassendi and Descartes (“Nouvelle Biographie\r\nGénérale,” 1858, Vol. VIII. p. 494) while the celebrated historian\r\nof the Council of Trent, Fra Paolo Sarpi--who will not be thought an\r\nincompetent judge--names Gilbert, with Francis Vieta (the greatest\r\nFrench mathematician of the sixteenth century) as the only original\r\nwriter among his contemporaries (“Lettere di Fra Paolo,” p. 31; Hallam,\r\n“Intro. to Lit.,” 1859, Vol. II. p. 464).\r\n\r\nIn Thos. Thomson’s “History of the Royal Society,” London, 1812, the\r\n“De Magnete” is thus alluded to: “Dr. Gilbert’s book on magnetism,\r\npublished in 1600, is one of the finest examples of inductive\r\nphilosophy that has ever been presented to the world. It is the more\r\nremarkable because it preceded the ‘Novum Organum’ of Bacon, in which\r\nthe inductive method of philosophizing was first explained.” How far\r\nGilbert was ahead of his time is best proven by the works of those\r\nwho wrote on magnetism during the first few decades after his death.\r\nThey contributed in reality nothing to the extension of this branch of\r\nphysical science. Poggendorff, from whose “Geschichte der Physik,” p.\r\n286, this is extracted, as already stated, calls Gilbert “the Galileo\r\nof Magnetism.” By Dr. Priestley, he was named “the Father of Modern\r\nElectricity.”\r\n\r\nThe tribute of Henry Hallam is to the following effect: “The year 1600\r\nwas the first in which England produced a remarkable work in physical\r\nscience; but this was one sufficient to raise a lasting reputation for\r\nits author. Gilbert, a physician, in his Latin treatise on the magnet,\r\nnot only collected all the knowledge which others had possessed on the\r\nsubject, but became at once the father of experimental philosophy in\r\nthis island, and, by a singular felicity and acuteness of genius, the\r\nfounder of theories which have been revived after a lapse of ages, and\r\nare almost universally received into the creed of science. Gilbert was\r\none of the earliest Copernicans, at least as to the rotation of the\r\nearth, and, with his usual sagacity, inferred, before the invention of\r\nthe telescope, that there are a multitude of fixed stars beyond the\r\nreach of our vision” (“Introduction to the Literature of the Fifteenth,\r\nSixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries,” London, 1859, Vol. II. p. 463).\r\n\r\nIn the “Principal Navigations ...” Edinburgh, 1889, Vol. XII. p. 10,\r\nRichard Hakluyt speaks of “... my worshipfull friend M. douctour\r\nGilbert, a gentleman no lesse excellent in the chiefest secrets of the\r\nMathematicks (as that rare iewel lately set forth by him in Latine\r\ndoeth euidently declare) then in his oune profession of physicke.”\r\n\r\nWe conclude this account of Gilbert in the quaint words of old Dr.\r\nFuller: “He has (said my informer[40]) the _clearness of Venice Glass_\r\nwithout the _Brittleness_ thereof, soon _Ripe_ and long _lasting_ is\r\nhis Perfection. He commenced _Doctor_ in _Physick_, and was _Physician_\r\nto Queen _Elizabeth_, who stamped on him many marks of her Favour,\r\nbesides an annuall Pension to encourage his studies. He addicted\r\nhimself to _Chemistry_, attaining to great exactness therein. One saith\r\nof him that he was _Stoicall_, but not _Cynicall_, which I understand\r\n_Reserved_; but not _Morose_, never married, purposely to be more\r\nbeneficial to his brethren. Such his _Loyalty_ to the Queen that, as\r\nif unwilling to survive, he dyed in the same year with her, 1603. His\r\n_Stature_ was _Tall_, Complexion Chearful, an Happiness not ordinary in\r\nso hard a student and so retired a person. He lyeth buried in _Trinity\r\nChurch_ in Colchester under a plain monument.”\r\n\r\n“_Mahomet’s Tombe_, at Mecha, is said strangely to _hang_ up, attracted\r\nby some invisible _Loadstone_, but the memory of this _Doctor_ will\r\nnever fall to the ground, which his incomparable book ‘De Magnete’\r\nwill _support_ to eternity” (“The History of the Worthies of England\r\nEndeavoured by Thomas Fuller, D.D.,” London, 1662, p. 332--Essex).\r\n\r\nIn his Epistle to Dr. Walter Charleton, physician in ordinary to King\r\nCharles I (Epist. III. p. 15, Vol. XI of the Works of Dryden, London,\r\n1803) the celebrated English poet predicts that:\r\n\r\n    “_Gilbert shall live till loadstones cease to draw\r\n    Or British fleets the boundless ocean awe._”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“La Grande Encyclopédie,” Vol. XVIII. p. 930;\r\n   “Dictionary of National Biography,” London, 1890, Vol. XXI. p.\r\n   338; “Bibliographica Britannica,” London, 1757, Vol. IV. p.\r\n   2202; Larousse, “Dict.

As Humboldt expresses it, the rich\r\nabundance of accurate observations furnished by Tycho Brahé, himself\r\nthe zealous opponent of the Copernican system, laid the foundation\r\nfor the discovery of those eternal laws of planetary movements which\r\nprepared imperishable renown for the name of Kepler, and which,\r\ninterpreted by Newton, proved to be theoretically and necessarily\r\ntrue, have been now transferred into the bright and glorious domain of\r\nthought as _the intellectual recognition of nature_ (“Cosmos,” 1860,\r\nVol. II. p. 313).\r\n\r\nAs his very able biographer, Dr. J. L. E. Dreyer, of the Armagh\r\nObservatory, remarks in his admirable work (Edinburgh, 1890): “Without\r\nBrahé, Kepler never could have found out the secrets of the planetary\r\nmotions, and, in the words of Delambre, ‘Nous ignorerions peut être\r\nencore le véritable système du monde.’ The most important inheritance\r\nwhich Tycho left to Kepler and to posterity was the vast mass of\r\nobservations all which, Kepler justly said, ‘deserved to be kept\r\namong the royal treasures, as the reform of astronomy could not be\r\naccomplished without them ...’ at one breath blowing away the epicycles\r\nand other musty appendages which disfigured the Copernican system....\r\nTycho Brahé had given Kepler the place to stand on and Kepler did move\r\nthe world!”\r\n\r\nBrahé was the first to recognize the variation, _i. e._ the\r\ninequality, in the moon’s motion. In opposition to the opinion of\r\nSédillot, M. Biot maintains that this fine discovery of Tycho by no\r\nmeans belongs to Abul-Wefa, and that the latter was acquainted not\r\nwith the “variation” but only with the second part of the “evection”\r\n(“Cosmos,” 1860, Vol. II. p. 222, wherein are many references to the\r\n_Comptes Rendus_ and to the “Journal des Savants”).\r\n\r\nThe biographical division of the “English Cyclopædia,” 1866, Vol. I.\r\npp. 898–903, gives a list of Brahé’s numerous writings, headed by his\r\nearliest publication, “De Nova Stella,” 1573, which is so extremely\r\nrare that, until 1890, when Dr. Dreyer gave a description of it, not\r\na single historian of astronomy had ever seen it or been able to even\r\ngive its title correctly (“Journal of Br.

Reference\r\nis likewise made to the fact that in December 1584 the King turned\r\nto Tycho for help, writing that he was under the impression he had\r\nreturned a compass made by Tycho, believing there was something wrong\r\nwith it; that, if this proved to be the case, Tycho was to send back\r\nthe compass, but, if not, he was to make two new ones similar to the\r\nold one (F. R.

Dr. Gilbert, a most excellent philosopher, and one of the ordinarie\r\nphysicians to Her Majestie.”\r\n\r\nHe had previously published, in 1589, “A briefe description of\r\nuniversal mappes and cardes and of their use; and also the use of\r\nPtolemy his Tables,” which was followed, during 1594, by his well-known\r\nwork on navigation. From the rare sixth edition of the latter (London,\r\n1622) the curious title page is worth reproducing as follows: “M.\r\nBlundeville, His Exercises, contayning eight treatises, the titles\r\nwhereof are set down in the next printed page: which treatises are\r\nvery necessary to be read and learned of all Young Gentlemen that\r\nhaue not beene exercised in such Disciplines and yet are desirous to\r\nhaue knowledge as well in Cosmographie, Astronomie and Geographie,\r\nas also in the art of navigation, in which art it is impossible, to\r\nprofit without the helpe of these or such like Instructions. To the\r\nfurtherance of which Art of Navigation the sayd Master Blundeville\r\nespecially wrote the said Treatises and of meere good will doth\r\ndedicate the same to all Young Gentlemen of this Realme.” The contents\r\nof this curious work treat of Arithmetic, Cosmography, Terrestrial and\r\nCelestial Globes, Peter Plancius, his Universal Map, Mr. Blagrau, his\r\nAstrolabe, The First Principles of Navigation, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nThe Mr. Blagrau here mentioned is John Blagrave, eminent English\r\nmathematician, author of “The Mathematical Jewel,” as well as of “The\r\nmaking and use of the familiar staffe,” of “The Art of Dialling,” and\r\nof “Astrolabium Uranicum Generale, a necessary and pleasunt solace and\r\nrecreation for Navigators in their long journeying, containing the use\r\nof an instrument or astrolabe.” From the last named, it appears that\r\nBlagrave was a convert to the heliocentric theory of Copernicus (“New\r\nGen. Biog. Dict.,” by Rev. H. J. Rose, London, 1850, Vol. IV. p. 277).\r\nThe invention of the dipping needle by Mr. Blagrave was before the\r\ndiscovery of the change of the needle’s variation by Mr. Gellibrand\r\n(“Philos.

Kepler’s doctrine is thus enunciated by Dr. Whewell (“Physical\r\nAstronomy,” Chap. I): “A certain Force or Virtue resides in the sun\r\nby which all bodies within his influence are carried around him.\r\nHe illustrates (‘De Stella Martis,’ Chap. XXXIV. p. 3) the nature\r\nof this Virtue in various ways, comparing it to Light and to the\r\nMagnetic Power, which it resembles in the circumstances of operating\r\nat a distance, and also in exercising a feebler influence as the\r\ndistance becomes greater.” In the Table of Contents of the work on the\r\nplanet Mars, the purport of the chapter to which allusion has been\r\nmade is stated as follows: “A Physical speculation, in which it is\r\ndemonstrated that the vehicle of that virtue which urges the planets,\r\ncirculates through the spaces of the universe after the manner of a\r\nriver or whirlpool (vortex), moving quicker than the planets.” It will\r\ndoubtless be found by any one who reads Kepler’s phrases concerning\r\nthe _moving force_--the _magnetic nature_--the _immaterial virtue_\r\nof the sun, that they convey no distinct conception, except so far\r\nas they are interpreted by the expressions here quoted: “A vortex of\r\nfluid constantly whirling around the sun, kept in this whirling motion\r\nby the rotation of the sun himself and carrying the planets around\r\nthe sun by its revolution, as a whirlpool carries straws, could be\r\nreadily understood; and though it appears to have been held by Kepler\r\nthat this current and vortex was immaterial, he ascribes to it the\r\npower of overcoming the inertia of bodies, and of putting them and\r\nkeeping them in motion, the only material properties with which he had\r\nanything to do. Kepler’s physical reasonings, therefore amount, in\r\nfact, to the doctrine of vortices around the central bodies and are\r\noccasionally so stated by himself; though by asserting these vortices\r\nto be ‘an immaterial species,’ and by the fickleness and variety of his\r\nphraseology on the subject, he leaves his theory in some confusion; a\r\nproceeding, indeed, which both his want of sound mechanical conceptions\r\nand his busy and inventive fancy might have led us to expect. Nor, we\r\nmay venture to say, was it easy for any one at Kepler’s time to devise\r\na more plausible theory than the theory of vortices might have been\r\nmade. It was only with the formation and progress of the science of\r\nmechanics that this theory became untenable.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Kepler, sa vie et ses ouvrages,” in the “Journal\r\n   des Savants” for June, July and August 1847; Kepler’s\r\n   manuscripts, “Phil.

Of this treatise,\r\nLibri says that the author, in his preface, deals tolerantly with\r\nthe many and varied theories concerning magnetic bodies, instancing\r\nmany of the most notable from those of Pliny and Nicander to those of\r\nRobert Norman. He is particularly emphatic concerning the production\r\nof perpetual motion by means of the loadstone, finding it “by the\r\nexperience of many ingenious practices ... impossible to be done.”\r\n\r\nFrom the notice given him in “Dict. of Nat. Biog.,” 1896, Vol.\r\nXLVIII. pp. 285–286, we learn that in the above-named work, he claims\r\nacquaintance with William Gilbert, whom he commends as the greatest\r\ndiscoverer in magnetical science, and that after giving twenty-four\r\nchapters on the properties and description of the magnet, he discusses\r\nthe variation of the compass and methods of estimating it in eight\r\nchapters, the inclinatory needle in eight others, concluding with\r\na chapter on finding the longitude and one “of the matter of the\r\nmagnetical globe of the earth by the needle.”\r\n\r\nIn 1617, he published “Animadversions on a late work entitled\r\nMagnetical Advertisement; or, Observations on the Nature and Properties\r\nof the Loadstone.”\r\n\r\n   =References.=--A.

The\r\nlast-named work, observes Macaulay, “takes in at once all the domains\r\nof science--all the past, the present and the future, all the errors\r\nof two thousand years, all the encouraging signs of the passing times,\r\nall the bright hopes of the coming age.” Prof. Playfair says of it\r\nthat “the power and compass of the mind which could form such a plan\r\nbeforehand, and trace not merely the outline but many of the most\r\nminute ramifications of sciences which did not yet exist, must be an\r\nobject of admiration to all succeeding ages.”\r\n\r\nIt was Sir John Herschel who remarked that “previous to the publication\r\nof the ‘Novum Organum’ natural philosophy, in any legitimate and\r\nextensive sense of the word, could hardly be said to exist.” In the\r\naddress presented in 1623 by the University of Oxford to Sir Francis\r\nBacon, he is represented “as a mighty Hercules who had by his own hand\r\ngreatly advanced those pillars in the learned world which by the rest\r\nof the world were supposed immovable.”\r\n\r\nTreating of the electric fluid, Bacon has given (“Physiological\r\nRemains,” London, 1648) a detailed list of attractive and\r\nnon-attractive bodies and the results of his very extensive experiments\r\nand observations in physical science generally, as well as of the\r\ninvestigations contained in Dr. Gilbert’s work. To the latter, however,\r\nmany allusions had already been made in Bacon’s “The Advancement\r\nof Learning,” published during 1605, two years before he was made\r\nSolicitor-General.\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory analyzation of Bacon’s researches is to be found\r\nin the attractive edition of his complete works published by Spedding,\r\nEllis and Heath, fifteen volumes, Boston, 1863. Therein will be seen\r\nthe following references to the magnet and magnetic virtue:\r\n\r\n   Vol. I. p. 435 (note). In Gilbert’s philosophy, the earth’s\r\n   magnetic action is not distinguished from gravity (De Mundo, II.\r\n   c. 3). That the magnetic action of the earth or of a magnet is\r\n   confined to a definite orb, appears from a variety of passages\r\n   (see “De Magnete,” II. c. 7, and the definitions prefixed to\r\n   this work). Gilbert distinguished between the “Orb of Virtue”\r\n   which includes the whole space through which any magnetic action\r\n   extends, and the “Orb of Coition” which is _totum illud\r\n   spatium per quod minimum magneticum per magnetem movetur_. He\r\n   asserts that the orb of the magnetic virtue extends to the moon\r\n   and ascribes the moon’s inequalities to the effects it produces\r\n   (“De Mundo,” II. c. 19).\r\n\r\n   Vol. VIII. Aphorisms. “If, before the discovery of the magnet,\r\n   any one had said that a certain instrument had been invented\r\n   by means of which the quarters and points of the heavens could\r\n   be taken and distinguished with exactness ... it would have\r\n   been judged altogether incredible ...” (pp. 141–142). “The\r\n   ‘Clandestine Instances’--which I also call ‘Instances of the\r\n   Twilight’ [the attraction or coming together of bodies]--and\r\n   which are pretty nearly the opposite of ‘Striking Instances....’\r\n   The most remarkable ‘Striking Instance’ is the magnet ... a\r\n   ‘Clandestine Instance’ is a magnet armed with iron; or, rather,\r\n   the iron is an armed magnet ...” (pp. 224–226). “The polarity\r\n   of the iron needle when touched with the magnet” (p. 261).\r\n   “The magnetic or attractive virtue admits of media without\r\n   distinction, nor is the virtue impeded in any kind of a medium”\r\n   (p. 269). “There is no medium known by the interposition of\r\n   which the operation of the magnet, in drawing iron, is entirely\r\n   prevented” (pp. 285–286). “A piece of a magnet does not draw\r\n   so much iron as the whole magnet” (p. 301). “As for the help\r\n   derived from the virtue of a cognate body, it is well seen in\r\n   an armed magnet, which excites in iron the virtue of detaining\r\n   iron by similarity of substance; the torpor of the iron being\r\n   cast off by the virtue of the magnet” (p. 311). “There are\r\n   four virtues or operations in the magnet ... the first is the\r\n   attraction of magnet to magnet, or of iron to magnet, or of\r\n   magnetised iron to iron; the second is its polarity, and at the\r\n   same time its declination; the third, its power of penetrating\r\n   through gold, glass, stone, everything; the fourth, its power\r\n   of communicating its virtue from stone to iron, and from iron\r\n   to iron, without communication of substance” (p. 313). “But the\r\n   flight of iron from one pole of the magnet is well observed by\r\n   Gilbert to be not a flight strictly speaking, but a conformity\r\n   and meeting in a more convenient situation” (p. 315). “The\r\n   magnet endues iron with a new disposition of its parts and a\r\n   conformable motion, but loses nothing of its own virtue” (p.\r\n   318).\r\n\r\n   Vol. IX. In the fifth book of “De Augmentis Scientiarum,” these\r\n   questions are asked: (1) A magnet attracts a solid piece of\r\n   iron; will a piece of a magnet dipped in a dissolution of iron\r\n   attract the iron itself and so get a coating of iron? (2) Again,\r\n   the magnetic needle turns to the pole; does it, in so doing,\r\n   follow the same course as the heavenly bodies? (3) And, if one\r\n   should turn the needle the wrong way, that is, point it to the\r\n   South and hold it there for a while, and then let it go; would\r\n   it, in returning to the North, go round by the West rather than\r\n   by the East? (pp. 75–76).\r\n\r\n   Vol. X. This contains, at pp. 269–272, the “Inquiry respecting\r\n   the Magnet,” of which the original paper is to be found in Vol.\r\n   IV. pp. 121–125. In Dr. Rawley’s list of works composed by\r\n   Bacon, during the last five years of his life, this “Inquisitio\r\n   de Magnete,” first published in 1658, stands last but two. At\r\n   p. 335 this same Vol. X will be found an extract from “De fluxu\r\n   et reflexu maris” (“The ebb and flow of the sea”) relative to\r\n   the inquiry as to whether the earth itself is a magnet, as was\r\n   asserted by Gilbert.\r\n\r\nBesides the “Clandestine Instances” or “Instances of the Twilight”\r\nalluded to above, mention could have been made more particularly of\r\nBacon’s observations (in s. 3 of the “Nov. Organ.”) under the direct\r\nheadings of “Instantiæ Citantes ... Supplementi ... Radii ... Magicæ,”\r\nas well as of “Motus Magneticus ... Excitationis ... Fugæ,” etc., which\r\nare fully explained at ss. 190–200 of Sir John Herschel’s “Discourse on\r\nthe study of Natural Philosophy.”\r\n\r\nThey have been analyzed as follows:\r\n\r\n   _Instantiæ Citantes_, to which may be reduced the “discovery of\r\n   a moving magnetic fluid, or an action circular and perpendicular\r\n   to the electrical current, yet connected with it.”\r\n\r\n   _Instantiæ Supplementi_, such as the magnet which attracts iron\r\n   through many substances that may be interposed. Perhaps, says\r\n   he, “some medium may be found to deaden this virtue more than\r\n   any other medium; such an instance of _substitution_, would be\r\n   in the way of degree, or _approximation_”; that is, it would\r\n   approach toward destroying the magnetic virtue. Iron possesses,\r\n   perhaps, this quality in a more marked manner than any other\r\n   substance.\r\n\r\n   _Instantiæ Radii_, leading to the suggestion that there may\r\n   exist some kind of “magnetic virtue which operates by consent,\r\n   between the globe of the earth and heavenly bodies; or between\r\n   the globe of the moon and the waters of the sea; or between the\r\n   starry heavens and the planets, by which they may be drawn to\r\n   their apogees,” or greatest distances from the earth.\r\n\r\n   _Instantiæ Magicæ_, such as the loadstone animating a number of\r\n   needles without loss of its own magnetism.\r\n\r\n   _Motus Magneticus_, such as the attraction of the heavenly\r\n   bodies, from an idea, perhaps, that it might be due to a species\r\n   of magnetism.\r\n\r\n   _Motus Excitationis_, such as the new property which is given to\r\n   iron by the magnet without any loss of power by the latter.\r\n\r\n   _Motus Fugæ_, such as “the repulsion of electrified pith balls;\r\n   also of the similar poles of two magnets. In the latter case,\r\n   all the force of a strong man has proved insufficient to make\r\n   the two north poles touch each other.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last-named work of Sir John Herschel is alluded to, under the\r\nheading of “Prerogative Instances” (“Prærogativæ Instantiarum”)\r\nby Thomas Fowler, who calls attention to the fact that among the\r\ncontemporaries of Francis Bacon by whom the Copernican theory was\r\nrejected are: Tycho Brahé (who, however--having died in 1601--did not\r\nlive to become acquainted with the discoveries of Galileo); Vieta, the\r\ngreatest mathematician of the sixteenth century (who died as early as\r\n1603); Christopher Clavius (who was employed by Gregory XIII to reform\r\nthe Calendar and was called the Euclid of his age); and possibly, from\r\nhis silence, the famous mechanician Stevinus (Delambre, “Histoire de\r\nl’Astronomie Moderne”).\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--The works of Sir Francis Bacon, Lord Chancellor\r\n   of England, by Basil Montagu, 16 vols., London, 1825–1834,\r\n   and the review thereof made by Thomas Babington Macaulay\r\n   (“Essays,” 1855, Vol. II. pp. 142–254 (“Edinburgh Review,” July\r\n   1837); Dr. W.

It was, in truth, to me a book, indeed, a miraculous\r\nbook, for it had neither leaves nor characters, and to read it, one\r\nhad no need of eyes, the ears alone answering the purpose. It was only\r\nnecessary to start the little machine, whence would soon come all the\r\ndistinct and different sounds common to the human voice.”\r\n\r\nAnother translation reads as follows: “On opening the box I found\r\ninside a concern of metal, something like one of our watches, full of\r\ncurious little springs and minute machinery. It was really a book,\r\nbut a wonderful book that has no leaves or letters; a book, for the\r\nunderstanding of which the eyes are of no use--only the ears are\r\nnecessary. When any one wishes to read, he winds up the machine with\r\nits great number of nerves of all kinds, and turns the pointer to the\r\nchapter he wishes to hear, when there come out, as if from the mouth\r\nof a man or of an instrument of music, the distinct and various sounds\r\nwhich serve the Great Lunarians as the expression of language.”\r\n\r\nAs has been said by one of his biographers, “amid the extravagance\r\nof some of his works, Bergerac nevertheless exhibited a pretty good\r\nacquaintance with the philosophy of Descartes.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Article “Aeronautics” in the “Encycl.

His theories on magnetism greatly resemble those of\r\nParacelsus, but in his treatment of them he shows himself much\r\nsuperior to the Swiss alchemist, whom Dr. Hœfer says he took as his\r\nmodel. “Magnetism,” Van Helmont observes, “is an unknown property of\r\na heavenly nature, very much resembling the stars, and not at all\r\nimpeded by any boundaries of space or time.... Every created being\r\npossesses his own celestial power and is closely allied with heaven\r\n... the spirit is everywhere diffused; and the spirit is the medium of\r\nmagnetism ... it is not the spirits of heaven and of hell which are\r\nmasters over physical nature, but the soul and spirit of man which are\r\nconcealed in him as the fire is concealed in the flint.”\r\n\r\nThe above-named work of Van Helmont was “translated, illustrated and\r\nampliated,” in 1650 by Dr. Walter Charleton, physician in ordinary to\r\nKing Charles I, under the name of “A Ternary of Paradoxes.” From its\r\ninteresting contents, we make the following extracts:\r\n\r\n   _Page 10._ “A loadstone placed upon a small trencher of wood,\r\n   floating on water, does instantly in one determinate point\r\n   _australize_, and in the other _septentrionate_ ... all which\r\n   various and admirable effects of the loadstone, thou maiest,\r\n   if thy judgement relish them, finde made good by multiplyed\r\n   observations, by William Gilbert, not many yeers past, a\r\n   physician in London, in his book, ‘De Magnete’: of which subject\r\n   no man ever writ more judiciously or experimentally: and by\r\n   whose industry the variation of the compasse may be restored....”\r\n\r\n   _Page 12._ “There is a book imprinted at Franekera, in the year\r\n   1611, by Vldericus Dominicus Balck, of the _Lamp of Life_. In\r\n   which you shall finde, out of Paracelsus, the true magneticall\r\n   cure of most diseases, as of the Dropsie, Gout, Jaundice, etc.”\r\n\r\n   _Page 15._ “Doth not the needle of the Mariner’s Compasse,\r\n   through a firme glasse, closely sealed up with melted soder (in\r\n   which there can be no pore or crany discovered) steer it self to\r\n   the Artick pole? ... wherefore the same numericall _accident_\r\n   streaming in one continued _radius_ from the loadstone into the\r\n   _aer_, passes through the glasse, and perhaps goes as farre as\r\n   to touch the pole it self....”\r\n\r\n   _Page 38._ “Wherefore the loadstone owes its polarity to a\r\n   natural inhærent faculty, flowing from its owne seminall\r\n   entity, and not to any forreigne alliciency, or attractive\r\n   influx transmitted from the north star. But that otherwise the\r\n   loadstone may, by its own instinct, be elevated towards the\r\n   Zenith, we have upon ocular demonstration found it true, by a\r\n   certain instrument invented by Guilielme Guilbert (the glory\r\n   of which excellent invention Ludovicus Fonseca hath lately\r\n   endeavoured to ravish) ... which by the spontaneous elevation of\r\n   the loadstone in a brasse ring suspended by a thread or small\r\n   wier, shews not only the latitude but also the altitude of the\r\n   pole, in all places of the earth.”\r\n\r\n   Page 39. “... the loadstone is endued with a _domestick pilot, a\r\n   directive faculty_, which guides it to some determinate place,\r\n   but is not at all attracted by the pole.”\r\n\r\n   Page 40. “The loadstone onely by the affriction of _Garlick_,\r\n   amits its _verticity_, and neglects the pole, conserving to\r\n   it self, in the meane time, its peculiar forme, materiall\r\n   constitution, and all other dependent proprieties. The reason,\r\n   because _Garlick_ is the loadstone’s proper Opium, and by it\r\n   that spirituall sensation in the magnet is consopited and layd\r\n   asleep.... Verily, that alliciency of the pole must be extreame\r\n   weake and of inconsiderable energy, which passing through so\r\n   many and so immense orbes of heaven, and striking through great\r\n   and firme buildings, and thick walls, cannot yet be of power\r\n   sufficient to pierce the thin juice of Garlick or the fume of\r\n   Mercury....”\r\n\r\n   Page 42. “There is therefore inhærent in the magnet an\r\n   _influentiall virtue_, which, being not obliged to the\r\n   propinquinty or comtiguous admotion of its object, is after\r\n   the nobler names of coelestiall influences, freely and without\r\n   interruption or languor transmitted so farre as to the pole it\r\n   self: since there is a spontaneous _eradiation_, or emission of\r\n   atomicall _radii_ from the body of the magnet to the pole.”\r\n\r\n   Page 74. “That the magnetisme of the loadstone and other\r\n   inanimate creatures is performed by a certaine naturall\r\n   sensation, the immediate anthrix of all sympathy, is a truth\r\n   unquestionable.”\r\n\r\n   Page 75. “For by one phansy it is directed to iron, and by\r\n   another to the pole ... the phansy of _amber_ delights to allect\r\n   strawes, chaffe, and other festucous bodies; by an attraction,\r\n   we confesse, observe obscure and weake enough, yet sufficiently\r\n   manifest and strong to attest an _Electricity_ or attractive\r\n   signature....”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Dict. of Nat.

This starre, from age to age, hath insensibly still crept\r\nnearer to the pole so that at this present it is not past three degrees\r\ndistant from the pole of the Æquator.

Therein, he says that Baptista Porta, who has made the\r\nseventh book of his “Magia Naturalis” a very storehouse and repertory\r\nof magnetic wonders, knows little about the movements of the loadstone\r\nand never has seen much of them, and that a great deal of what he has\r\nlearned about its obvious properties, either through Messer Paolo, the\r\nVenetian, or through his own studies, is not very accurately noted and\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to the 1658 edition of his “Natural Magick,” Porta\r\nadmits that he gained some knowledge of Sarpi, who, says he, is of all\r\nmen he ever knew the most learned and skilful and the ornament and\r\nsplendour not only of Venice or of Italy, but of the entire world.\r\nBertelli refers (“Memor. sopra P. Peregrino,” p. 24, note) to P.\r\nGarbio’s “Annali di Serviti,” Lucca, 1721, Vol. II. pp. 263, 272, 274,\r\nand to Fra Fulgenzio Micanzio’s “Life of Sarpi,” Helmstat--Verona,\r\n1750, in which it is stated that not only Porta but likewise a\r\ncelebrated _ultramontane_ studied magnetism under him. Garbio asks:\r\n“Could this _ultramontane_ be Gilbert of Colchester?”\r\n\r\nBy Griselini (“Vita de Fra P. Sarpi”--memoria anecdote--Lausanne,\r\n1760), Paolo is said to have written a treatise on the magnet and to\r\nhave therein recorded many observations, including the earliest mention\r\nthat magnetic properties are destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nBertelli--whose afore-named memoir we must confine ourselves to, as\r\nit is more satisfactory than are the accounts elsewhere given--makes\r\nmention that he has had in his possession, by courtesy of Sig. Giuseppe\r\nValentinelli, the Royal Librarian of the Marciana at Venice, copy of\r\na manuscript (Cod. CXXIX, classe 2, MS. Ital.) containing a brief\r\ncomparison of Sarpi’s magnetic researches with those of Musschenbroek.\r\nThis manuscript is again alluded to by Bertelli (Memor., p. 88)\r\nwherein it is said that lines 5–38 of the first column, p. 170, are\r\nheaded “Observations of F.P.S. on the loadstone, collated with P.\r\nMusschenbroek’s Researches,” and embrace five paragraphs translated as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n   1. The author had first tried the action of one magnet on\r\n   another without entering into the question of calculation,\r\n   but modern authors have, in view of the observations made,\r\n   endeavoured to discover a method of computing magnetic forces\r\n   in any proportion to the distances, and in the same better\r\n   regulated systems they have discovered the cause to be uncertain\r\n   (or varying) owing to the contemporaneous action of magnetic\r\n   repulsion.\r\n\r\n   2. He was acquainted with the well-known action of the\r\n   magnet on iron, but he understood--as even at this day\r\n   some understand--that it was caused by the atmosphere. New\r\n   experiments have made us seriously doubt this. He did not pay\r\n   attention to the proportion of the magnetic forces as compared\r\n   with the distances of iron, to the discovery of which the\r\n   efforts of present philosophers are directed but in vain. He\r\n   saw, however, that the facility or difficulty of attraction\r\n   depends upon the size of the iron (maximum and minimum).\r\n\r\n   3. He was not ignorant of the direction of the magnet and of\r\n   iron rubbed with the magnet towards certain quarters of the sky\r\n   when he mentions the new discovery of the poles in the magnet,\r\n   and the variation of the magnetized needle, from the Northern or\r\n   the Southern quarters, but he did not know a greater number than\r\n   two poles found in the magnet, the variation of the declination,\r\n   or, I should rather say, the uncertainty of the variation and\r\n   the different inclinations of the needle at different places on\r\n   the earth.\r\n\r\n   4. Almost all the experiments referred to by Academies, with\r\n   reference to the action of one piece of iron on another piece\r\n   of iron, magnetized and not magnetized, and with regard to the\r\n   changes of forces which arise from the various inflections of\r\n   iron, have been sufficiently sketched out by F. P. S.\r\n\r\n   5. The magnetic effects acquired by an old piece of iron\r\n   continually exposed to the air have also been alluded to. Now,\r\n   however, natural philosophers have observed that this iron\r\n   exposed for a length of time in the magnetic meridian points\r\n   with greater readiness to the above-mentioned quarters. They\r\n   have, moreover, ascertained that iron when heated and afterwards\r\n   cooled in water is more sensitive to magnetization: which is\r\n   directly opposed to the opinion of F. P. S.\r\n\r\nBertelli further remarks that, from information given in the\r\nmanuscript, it is seen that Sarpi was at that time acquainted with the\r\ngreater number of the magnetic phenomena referred to by Porta, and\r\ndeveloped by Gilbert, viz.:\r\n\r\n   1. The reciprocal action of magnets;\r\n\r\n   2. The action of magnets on iron;\r\n\r\n   3. The manifestation of magnetic activity about the poles\r\n   (sphere of action or field of force);\r\n\r\n   4. The _Maximum_ and the _Minimum_ of the attractive\r\n   force of magnets on iron, according to the size of the latter;\r\n\r\n   5. The inversion of polarity which may arise in the\r\n   magnetization of needles--(but not the corresponding\r\n   poles--the magnetic variation or declination--Petrus\r\n   Peregrinus, A.D. 1269--yet not the variation of the\r\n   variation--Henry Gellibrand, A.D. 1635--nor the dip or\r\n   inclination--Robert Norman, A.D. 1576).\r\n\r\n   6. The magnetic properties acquired by iron constantly exposed\r\n   to the air.\r\n\r\nAfter detailing the observations of Giulio Cesare Moderati, Filippo\r\nCosta (Costæus) of Mantua, Ulysses Aldrovandi, Francesco Acoromboni,\r\nLuigi Matteini, Father Garzoni and Father Cabæus concerning the\r\nmagnetized ironwork of the belfry of the church of St. Augustine at\r\nArimini (the parochial church of St. John the Baptist, which at that\r\ntime, 1586, belonged to the monks of St. Augustine) and relative to the\r\niron rail in the belfry of the tower of St. Laurence at Rome, Bertelli\r\nsays: “From all that precedes, we gather at all events, that the fact\r\nof the spontaneous magnetization of iron was well known in Italy before\r\nSarpi, Porta and Gilbert. This, Gilbert, and still better Cabæus,\r\nexplained as the influence of terrestrial magnetism. However, with\r\nregard to the observations of the needle’s deviation made by Father\r\nGarzoni at Rome, we can, without having attributed it, as does Cabæus,\r\nto the magnetization of pieces of iron concealed in its wall, explain\r\nit, as is done in the new and important experiments of the illustrious\r\nprofessor Silvestro Gherardi, who attributes it to the magnetic\r\npolarity of the _Mattoni_ [bricks] in the structure itself.”\r\n\r\nIt is said by Humboldt (“Cosmos,” 1849, Vol. II. p. 718, note) that\r\nthis observation, the first of the kind, was made on the tower of\r\nthe church of the Augustines at Mantua (Mantova) and that Grimaldi\r\nand Gassendi were acquainted with similar instances (instancing the\r\ncross of the church of St. Jean, at Aix, in Provence), in geographical\r\nlatitudes where the inclination of the magnetic needle is very\r\nconsiderable. Some writers give Gassendi’s observation as occurring\r\nduring 1632 (see Rohaulti, “Physica,” 1718, Par. III. cap. 8, p. 399;\r\nor, Rohault’s “System of Nat. Phil.,” 1728, p. 176).\r\n\r\n“As the iron cross of an hundred weight upon the Church of St. John\r\nin Ariminum, or that load-stoned iron of Cæsar Moderatus, set down by\r\nAldrovandus” (Sir Thomas Browne, “Pseudodoxia Epidemica,” 1658, p. 66).\r\n\r\nConsult “Lettera dell’Eccel. Cavallara.,” Mantova, 1586, for a detailed\r\naccount of this discovery, made January 6, of the last-named year. The\r\niron rod supported a brick ornament in the form of an acorn, and stood\r\non a pyramid at the summit of the belfry of the church of St. Augustine\r\n(Cabæus, “Philos. Magn.,” p. 62; “Ulysses Aldrovandi, Patr. Bonon ...\r\nBarthol. Ambros ...” Lib. i, cap. 6, p. 134).\r\n\r\nFor the account given by Aldrovandi of the Arimini observation and for\r\nreferences to Browne’s “Pseudodoxia Epidemica,” as well as to Boyle’s\r\n“Experiments,” see p. 53 of the valuable “Notes on the ‘De Magnete’ of\r\nDr. William Gilbert,” by Silvanus P. Thompson, attached to the English\r\ntranslation of the original 1600 edition, which was so attractively\r\nproduced by the Gilbert Club during the year 1900.

Epidemica,” London,\r\n1650, p. 48; U. Aldrovandi, “Musæum Metallicum,” Milan, 1648, p. 134).\r\n\r\nIn the “Vie de Pierre Gassendi,” par le Père Bougerel de l’Oratoire,\r\nParis, 1737, p. 14, it is related that during the month of September\r\n1621, while promenading about three leagues’ distance from Aix in a\r\nvillage named Peynier, he observed a light in the heavens to which he\r\ngave the name of _aurora borealis_, as much on account of its location\r\nas by reason of its resemblance to the light which precedes the rising\r\nof the sun.\r\n\r\nFrom the “History of the Royal Society,” by C. R. Weld, 1848, Vol. II.\r\np. 430, is taken the following, communicated by Humboldt:\r\n\r\n“The movement of the magnetic lines, the first recognition of which is\r\nusually ascribed to Gassendi, was not even yet conjectured by William\r\nGilbert; but, at an early period, Acosta, ‘from the information of\r\nPortuguese navigators,’ assumed four lines of no declination upon the\r\nsurface of the globe.... In the remarkable map of America appended to\r\nthe Roman edition of the Geography of Ptolemy in 1508, we find, to\r\nthe north of Gruentland (Greenland), a part of Asia represented and\r\nthe magnetic pole marked as an insular mountain. Martin Cortez, in\r\nthe ‘Breve Compendio de la Sphera’ (1545), and Livio Sanuto, in the\r\n‘Geographia di Tolomeo’ (1588), place it more to the south. Sanuto\r\nentertained a prejudice, which, strange to say, has existed in later\r\ntimes, that a man who should be so fortunate as to reach the magnetic\r\npole (_Il calamitico_) would then experience _alcun miracoloso\r\nstupendo effecto_” (“Cosmos,” translated under the superintendence of\r\nCol. Sabine, Vol. II. p. 280). In a footnote to the Otté translation of\r\nHumboldt, 1859, Vol. V. p. 58, it is stated that _calamitico_ was the\r\nname given to the instruments in consequence of the first needles for\r\nthe compass having been made in the shape of a frog.\r\n\r\nIn Gilbert’s “De Magnete,” allusion is made to Martinus Cortez, Book\r\nI. chap. i., also Book III. chap. i. and Book IV. chap. i.,[43] and to\r\nLivio Sanuto in Book I. chap. i., also in Book IV. chaps. i. and ix. In\r\nthese several passages, Gilbert tells us that Martinus Cortez holds the\r\nloadstone’s seat of attraction to be beyond the poles, and he states\r\nthe views of other writers in this respect, citing more particularly\r\nT. de Bessard (author of “Le Dialogue de la Longitude”), Jacobus\r\nServertius (who wrote “De Orbis Catoptrici”), as well as Robert Norman,\r\nFranciscus Maurolycus, Marsilio Ficino, Cardan, Scaliger, Costa and\r\nPetrus Peregrinus (M.

He told me that, at such a short\r\ndistance, the action could not be witnessed to advantage; so I sent\r\nhim away and said that I could not just then go to Egypt or Muscovy to\r\nsee his experiment, but if he would go there himself I would stay and\r\nattend to the rest in Venice.”\r\n\r\nThis _Sagredus_ (Iohannes Franciscus), or Sagredo (Giovanni Francisco),\r\nbesides being “a great magneticall man,” was a noble Venetian, even a\r\ndoge, and had represented his country as ambassador at several courts.\r\nWe read in Mr. Conrad W. Cooke’s very able article on William Gilbert\r\nof Colchester, originally printed in London “Engineering,” that this\r\nsame _Sagredus_ was the intimate friend of Galileo, and that, together\r\nwith the powerful Sarpi, he used the whole might of his name and\r\ninfluence to protect the great philosopher and mathematician from the\r\nattacks of the clerical party. Pietro Sarpi, otherwise known as Father\r\nPaul, was, as already shown, a most illustrious Venetian scholar, who\r\nattained great proficiency in the medical and physiological sciences\r\nas well as in mathematics and in natural philosophy. _Sagredus_ made\r\nseveral meritorious researches in magnetism, and, while on a voyage\r\nto Aleppo, ascertained the declination of the magnetic needle at that\r\nplace. As a tribute to the scientific attainments of _Sagredus_,\r\nGalileo gave his name to one of the characters in his “Systema\r\nCosmicum,” and many references to the work by William Gilbert are put\r\ninto the mouth of _Sagredus_.\r\n\r\nIn further illustration of Galileo’s appreciation of Gilbert, the\r\nfollowing is quoted from the great astronomer’s own writing: “I\r\nextremely admire and envy the author of ‘De Magnete.’ I think him\r\nworthy of the greatest praise for the many new and true observations\r\nwhich he has made, to the disgrace of so many vain and fabling authors,\r\nwho write not from their own knowledge only, but repeat everything\r\nthey hear from the foolish and vulgar, without attempting to satisfy\r\nthemselves of the same by experience; perhaps that they may not\r\ndiminish the size of their books” (Drinkwater’s “Life of Galileo”).\r\n\r\nGalileo had also published, in 1630, the first edition of his “I\r\ndiscorsi e demonstrazioni ...” which Lagrange considers to be Galileo’s\r\nmost substantial title to scientific glory.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Galileo’s Biography in “Engl.

The _diurnal and horary\r\nvariation_ was found by Graham in 1722, and the _annual variation_ was\r\ndiscovered by Cassini, 1782–1791.\r\n\r\nGellibrand’s discovery is published in a small quarto pamphlet\r\nentitled “A discourse mathematical on the variation of the magneticall\r\nneedle--together with the admirable diminution lately discovered,” and\r\nis the result of his study of the observations made by Burrough and\r\nGunter as well as of observations made by himself, all showing that the\r\nnorth-east of the needle was gradually moving to the westward.\r\n\r\nMention has already been made of the fact that the _variation of the\r\nvariation_ was at this period attracting the attention it deserved,\r\nand it is worth while giving here an account of the discovery in the\r\nauthor’s own words:\r\n\r\n“Thus, hitherto, according to the Tenents of all our Magnetical\r\nPhilosophers, we have supposed the variations of all particular places\r\nto continue one and the same. So that when a Seaman shall happly return\r\nto a place where formerly he found the same variation, he may hence\r\nconclude he is in the same former longitude. For it is the assertion\r\nof Mr. Dr. Gilbert’s _Variatio unicuiusq; loci constans est_, that\r\nis to say, the same place doth always retaine the same variation.\r\nNeither hath this assertion, for ought I ever heard, been questioned\r\nby any man. But most diligent magneticall observations have plainely\r\noffered violence to the same, and proved the contrary, namely, that the\r\nvariation is accompanied with a variation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1637.=--Bond (Henry), Professor of Mathematics in London,\r\nand who appears in one of his treatises as “a famous teacher of the\r\nart of navigation,” is the author of the “Seaman’s Kalendar ... with a\r\ndiscovery of the ... secret of longitude ...” of which other editions\r\nappeared during 1640 and 1696.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by many papers on the variation (the most important\r\nof which are to be found in _Phil. Trans._ for 1668, 1672, 1673)\r\nand, during 1678 by “The Longitude not found, or an answer to a\r\ntreatise written by H. B. ...” This treatise was in a sixty-five page\r\npamphlet which had been issued by Mr. Bond’s father during 1676, under\r\ncaption: “The Longitude Found; or a treatise shewing an easie and\r\nspeedy way, as well by Night as by Day, to find the Longitude, having\r\nbut the Latitude of the Place and the Inclination of the Magneticall\r\nInclinatorie Needle ...” wherein he explains his discovery of the\r\nprogress of the deviation of the compass and foretells the variations\r\nfor London, 1663 to 1716. This treatise led to the controversy with\r\nPeter Blackborrow (Beckborrow), the title to whose published work\r\nreads: “The Longitude not found: or an answer to a treatise written by\r\nH. Bond, senior, shewing a way to find the longitude by the magnetical\r\ninclinatory needle: wherein is proved that the longitude is not nor\r\ncannot be found by the magnetic inclinatory needle.”\r\n\r\nAs Humboldt remarks, the resulting controversy, together with Acosta’s\r\nview that there were four lines of no variation which divided the\r\nearth’s surface, may, as already stated, have had some influence on\r\nthe theory advanced, in 1683, by Edmund Halley, of four magnetic poles\r\nor points of convergence (“Cosmos,” 1859–1860, Vol. I. p. 193, note;\r\nVol. II. pp. 280–281, note; Vol. V. p. 58; also Humboldt’s “Examen\r\nCritique de l’Histoire de la Géographie,” Vol. III. p. 60.

There being always a certain space\r\nof intermission, for the passage of the voice, betwixt its going into\r\nthese cavities and its coming out; he conceives that if both ends were\r\nseasonably stopped, while the sound was in the midst, it would continue\r\nthere till it had some vent. _Huic tubo verba nostra insusurremus,\r\net cum probe munitur tabellario committamus_, etc. When the friend\r\nto whom it is sent shall receive and open it, the words shall come out\r\ndistinctly, and in the same order wherein they were spoken. From such\r\na contrivance as this [saith the same author] did Albertus Magnus make\r\nhis Image, and Friar Bacon his Brazen Head, to utter certain words.”\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth chapter, he makes suggestions for “a language that\r\nmay consist of only tunes and musical notes, without any articulate\r\nsound.”\r\n\r\nHe had previously described a novel mode of telegraphing by the use of\r\nonly three torches (or lights), to designate the twenty-four letters of\r\nthe alphabet. These letters were, according to the plan of Joachimus\r\nFortius, to be placed in three classes of eight each. One torch\r\nindicated Class I, two torches Class II, three torches Class III, and\r\nthe number of the letter was shown by the number of times a torch was\r\nelevated.\r\n\r\nBishop Wilkins also described a method of telegraphing by means of two\r\nlights attached to long poles, which, he says, “for its quickness and\r\nspeed is much to be preferred before any of the rest.” To interpret\r\nmessages at long distances, he suggested the use of the then newly\r\ninvented telescope; which he called “Galileus his perspective.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--The third edition of above-named work, Chap.

He asserted that, although every particle of matter\r\nand even the intangible “powers” were magnetic, they did not themselves\r\nconstitute a magnet. _There is but one Magnet in the universe, and\r\nfrom it proceeds the magnetization of everything existing._ This\r\nmagnet is, of course, what the Kabalists term the central Spiritual\r\nSun, or God.... He demonstrates the difference between mineral\r\nmagnetism and zoömagnetism, or animal magnetism, and says that the sun\r\nis the most magnetic of all bodies.... It imparts the binding power to\r\nall things falling under its direct rays (“Isis Unveiled,” pp. 208–210).\r\n\r\nAnother Jesuit, Jacobo Grandamico (1588–1672), published in 1645, “Nova\r\ndemonstratio immobilitatis terræ petita ex virtute magnetica,” wherein\r\nhe shares fully the views of Niccolas Cabæus, Athanasius Kircher,\r\nVincentus Leotaudus and others of the same Order relative to the\r\nearth’s magnetism (Larousse, “Dict.,” Vol. VIII. p. 1445).\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Journal des Sçavans” pour 1665 et 1666, pp.\r\n   519–525, 571–578; “Nouveau Larousse,” par Claude Augé, Paris,\r\n   Vol. V. p. 485; “Salmonsen ... konversationsleksikon,” 1900, p.\r\n   480; Van Swinden, “Recueil,” 1784, Vol. II. pp. 352, 361, 394,\r\n   and the different works named in Ronalds’s “Catalogue,” pp.\r\n   266–267; ninth ed. “Encycl.

In\r\nshort, then, all the knowledge he gott of this subject was by forming\r\na little loadstone into the shape of the earth. By which meanes he\r\ncompassed a wonderful designe, which was to make the whole globe of the\r\nearth maniable; for he found the properties of the whole earth in that\r\nlittle body; which he therefore called a Terrella, or little earth;\r\nand which he could manage and trye experiences vpon att his will. And,\r\nin like manner, any man that hath an ayme to aduance much in naturall\r\nsciences, must endeauour to draw the matter he inquireth of, into some\r\nsuch modell, or some kinde of manageable methode; which he may turne\r\nand winde as he pleaseth.

His main idea was that a rush of subtle matter passes very\r\nrapidly through the earth from the equator towards each pole, being\r\nopposed by magnetic substances throughout its passage and that the sun\r\nis the centre of a vortex of an ethereal fluid, whose whirling motion\r\nproduces the revolution of planets about the sun, or around the fixed\r\nstars. Moreover, as Noad states it, “the vortex moves with the greatest\r\nfacility in a particular direction, one of its ends being always turned\r\ntoward the north.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent fellow-students of Descartes was Marin\r\nMersenne, who joined the religious Order of “Minimes,” and who, after\r\npublishing in 1634 and 1639 “Les Mécaniques de Galilée” and “Nouvelles\r\nDécouvertes de Galilée,” brought out, during the years 1644 and 1647,\r\nhis well-known “Cogitata physico-mathematica,” which, Montucla says,\r\ncontains _un océan d’observations de toutes espèces_ ... and embraces\r\na very interesting treatise on navigation besides many letters from\r\nleading scientists of that period not elsewhere to be found.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“La grande Encyclopédie,” Vol. XXIII. pp. 730–731;\r\n   Larousse, “Dict.,” Vol. XI. p. 94; “Biographie Générale,” Vol.\r\n   XXXV. pp. 118–123; “The English Cyclopædia,” Vol. IV. p. 206;\r\n   Alex.

And this is pretended from the sympathy of two needles, touched\r\nwith the same loadstone, and placed in the centre of two abecedary\r\ncircles or rings, with letters described round about them, one friend\r\nkeeping one and another keeping the other, and agreeing upon the hour\r\nwhen they will communicate, at what distance of place soever, when one\r\nneedle shall be removed unto another letter, the other, by wonderful\r\nsympathy, will move unto the same.”\r\n\r\nAs the result of experiment, he found that “though the needles were\r\nseparated but half a span, when one was moved the other would stand\r\nlike the pillars of Hercules, and if the earth stand still, have surely\r\nno motion at all.... By electrical bodies,” he says, “I understand not\r\nsuch as are metallical, mentioned by Pliny and the ancients; for their\r\n_electrum_ was a mixture made of gold, with the addition of a fifth\r\npart of silver; a substance now as unknown as true _aurichalcum_, or\r\n_Corinthian_ brass, and set down among things lost by Pancirollus. Nor\r\nby electric bodies do I imagine such only as take up shavings, straws\r\nand light bodies, amongst which the ancients placed only _jet_ and\r\n_amber_, but such as, conveniently placed unto their objects, attract\r\nall bodies palpable whatsoever. I say conveniently placed, that is, in\r\nregard of the object, that it be not too ponderous or any way affixed;\r\nin regard of the agent, that it be not foul or sullied, but wiped,\r\nrubbed and excitated; in regard of both, that they be conveniently\r\ndistant, and no impediment interposed. I say, all bodies palpable,\r\nthereby excluding fire, which indeed it will not attract, nor yet\r\ndraw through it, for fire consumes its effluxions by which it should\r\nattract.”\r\n\r\nThe different chapters of this second book treat of the loadstone, of\r\nbodies magnetical and electrical, of magnetical rocks and attractive\r\nmountains, and also make allusion to the cross on the church of St.\r\nJohn in Ariminium, to the reported magnetical suspension of Mahomet’s\r\ntomb, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nAt pp. 64, 81 and 87 of Chap. II he says: “Neither is it onely true,\r\nwhat Gilbertus first observed, that irons refrigerated North and\r\nSouth acquire a directive faculty; but if they be cooled upright and\r\nperpendicularly, they will also obtain the same.... Now this kind\r\nof practice, Libavius, Gilbertus and lately Swickardus, condemn, as\r\nvain and altogether unuseful; because a loadstone in powder hath no\r\nattractive power; for, in that form, it omits the polarity and loseth\r\nthose parts which are the rule of attraction.... Glasse attracts but\r\nweakely though cleere, some slick stones and thick glasses attract\r\nindifferently; Arsenic not at all; Saltes generally but weakely, as Sal\r\nGemma, Allum and also Talke, nor very discoverably by any frication;\r\nbut, if gently warmed at the fire and wiped with a dry cloth, they will\r\nbetter develop their Electricities.”\r\n\r\nAt Chapter XVII of the seventh book of the above-mentioned treatise,\r\nBrowne makes allusion to “the story of Frier Bacon that made a Brazen\r\nHead to speak these words: “_Time is_....”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Library of Literary Criticism,” Chas.

Philippi Harsdoerffer (Senator of Nuremberg), to\r\n“La Récréation Mathématique” of Jean Leurechon, and to the works of\r\nCardan, Mizauld, Aldrovandi and others.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Notice Raisonnée des Ouvrages de Gaspar Schott,”\r\n   par M.

It\r\nconsisted of a globe of sulphur, cast in a glass sphere, and mounted\r\nupon a revolving axis, which when rubbed by a cloth pressed against\r\nit by the hand, emitted both sound and light. It was Guericke who\r\n“heard the first sound and saw the first light in artificially excited\r\nelectricity.” He proved that light bodies, when attracted by an excited\r\nelectric, were immediately repelled by the latter and became incapable\r\nof a second attraction until touched by some other body; also that\r\nlight bodies develop electrical excitation when suspended within the\r\nsphere of an excited electric.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Experimenta Nova Magdeburgica,” 1672, lib.\r\n   iv, cap. 15, p. 147, also all relating to the sulphur globe\r\n   reproduced from the “Experimenta Nova” at end of Figuier’s\r\n   “Exposition et Histoire,” etc., Vol. IV.

The globular end may be\r\nsubjected to quite a smart stroke without breaking, but if a particle\r\nof the tail is nipped off, the whole flies into fine powder with almost\r\nexplosive violence.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Peter did show us the experiment (which I had heard talked of) of\r\nthe chymicall glasses, which break all to dust by breaking off a little\r\nsmall end; which is a great mystery to me” (Samuel Pepys, “Diary,”\r\nJanuary 13, 1662).\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster discovered that the fracture of these unannealed\r\ndrops was accompanied by the evolution of electrical light, which\r\nappears even when they are broken under water. Mr. Bennet observed\r\nthat when one of the drops was placed upon a book, the latter was\r\nelectrified negatively.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--The articles on “Annealing,” “Optics,” and\r\n   “Electricity” in the “Encyclopædia Britannica”; also the\r\n   biography in “Penny Cycl.,” Vol. XX. pp. 226–227; Le Cat,\r\n   “Memoir,” London, 1749–1750, or _Philos.

It is as follows: “But yet\r\nto advance another instance. That men should confer at very distant\r\nremoves by an extemporary intercourse is a reputed impossibility; but\r\nyet there are some hints in natural operations that give us probability\r\nthat ’tis feasible, and may be compassed without unwarrantable\r\nassistance from demoniack correspondence. That a couple of needles\r\nequally touched by the same magnet, being set in two dials exactly\r\nproportioned to each other, and circumscribed by the letters of the\r\nalphabet, may effect this ‘magnale’ (_i. e._ important result)\r\nhath considerable authorities to avouch it.\r\n\r\n“The manner of it is thus represented: Let the friends that would\r\ncommunicate take each a dial, and, having appointed a time for their\r\nsympathetic conference, let one move his impregnate needle to any\r\nletter in the alphabet, and its affected fellow will precisely respect\r\nthe same. So that, would I know what my friend would acquaint me with,\r\n’tis but observing the letters that are pointed at by my needle, and\r\nin their order transcribing them from their sympathized index, as its\r\nmotion directs; and I may be assured that my friend described the same\r\nwith his, and that the words on my paper are of his inditing. Now,\r\nthough there will be some ill-contrivance in a circumstance of this\r\ninvention, in that the thus impregnate needles will not move to, but\r\navert from each other (as ingenious Dr. Browne hath observed), yet this\r\ncannot prejudice the main design of this way of secret conveyance;\r\nsince it is but reading counter to the magnetic informer, and noting\r\nthe letter which is most distant in the Abecederian circle from that\r\nwhich the needle turns to, and the case is not altered.\r\n\r\n“Now, though this desirable effect may possibly not yet answer the\r\nexpectations of inquisitive experiment, yet ’tis no despicable item,\r\nthat by some other such way of magnetick efficiency it may hereafter\r\nwith success be attempted, when magical history shall be enlarged by\r\nriper inspections; and ’tis not unlikely but that present discoveries\r\nmight be improved to the performance.”\r\n\r\nGlanvill is also the author of “Philosophical Considerations Touching\r\nWitches and Witchcraft,” 1666, and of “The Sadducismus Triumphatus,”\r\n1681.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Dict. of Nat.

This explains its extreme scarcity. It was this work\r\nwhich led to the public controversy between Hevelius and Dr. Hooke\r\nwho published, in London, during 1674 his “Animad. in Mach. Celest.\r\nHevelii.”\r\n\r\nIt is said that, next to John Flamsteed, Hevelius was the most accurate\r\nobserver of the heavens in his day (“The Reliquary,” London, Vol. XIV.\r\npp. 149–159 and Vol. XV. pp. 34–38; “Journal des Savants” for March,\r\nJune and November 1836).

Bray, London, p. 716), says of Boyle:\r\n“It must be confess’d that he had a marvailous sagacity in finding out\r\nmany usefull and noble experiments. Never did stubborn matter come\r\nunder his inquisition but he extorted a confession of all that lay in\r\nher most intimate recesses; and what he discover’d he as faithfully\r\nregister’d, and frankly communicated....”\r\n\r\nProf. Tyndall remarks (“Lecture,” February 4, 1875): “The tendency\r\nto physical theory showed itself in Boyle. He imagined that the\r\nelectrified body threw out a glutinous or unctuous effluvium, which\r\nlaid hold of small bodies, and, in its return to the source from which\r\nit emanated, carried them along with it.”\r\n\r\nA few of his many characteristic remarks and observations are, however,\r\nbest given in his own words, as extracted from the “Philosophical\r\nWorks” above alluded to:\r\n\r\n“The invention of the mariner’s needle, which giveth the direction, is\r\nno less benefit for navigation than the invention of the sails, which\r\ngive the motion” (London, 1738, Vol. I. p. 62).\r\n\r\n“I, with a certain body (rough diamond), not bigger than a pea, but\r\nvery vigorously attractive, moved a steel needle, freely poised, about\r\nthree minutes after I had left off rubbing it” (Vol. I. p. 508).\r\nSpeaking elsewhere of his experiments with diamonds, he says: “But when\r\nI came to apply it (the loadstone) to one more, which look’d somewhat\r\nduller than almost any of the rest, I found that it had in it particles\r\nenough of an iron nature to make it a magnetical body and observed\r\nwithout surprise that not only it would suffer itself to be taken up\r\nby the strongest pole of the loadstone, but when the pole was offer’d\r\nwithin a convenient distance it would readily leap through the air to\r\nfasten itself to it.”\r\n\r\n“I removed a piece of amber in the sunbeams till they had made it\r\nmoderately hot and then found it would attract those light bodies it\r\nwould not stir before” (Vol. I. p. 400, and Vol. III. p. 52).\r\n\r\n“Whether from such experiments one may argue that it is but, as it\r\nwere, by accident that amber attracts another body, and not this the\r\namber; and whether these ought to make us question, if _electrics\r\nmay_, with so much propriety, as has been generally supposed, _be\r\nsaid to attract_, are doubts, that my design does not oblige me to\r\nexamine” (Vol. IV. p. 350).\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--John Evelyn’s “Diary,” Letter to Mr. Wotton, March\r\n   30, 1696; Libes’ “Histoire Phil. du Progrès de la Physique,”\r\n   Paris, 1810; Boyle’s “Mechanical Origine or Production of\r\n   Electricity,” 1675; Birch, “Life of Hon.

Dr. Law, in Suffolk:\r\n\r\n   “Dear Doctor,” it begins, “He that in ye mine of knowledge\r\n   deepest diggeth, hath, like every other miner ye least breathing\r\n   time, and must sometimes at least come to terr; alt (terra\r\n   alta) for air.

Sometimes, it is termed by him, a subtil\r\nspirit, as in the latter part of his “Principia,” and sometimes a\r\nsubtil ætherial medium, as in his “Optics.” By many it is supposed to\r\npervade all space, also the interior of solid bodies, and to be the\r\nmedium of the transmission of light and heat. The æther of Descartes\r\nwas his _materia subtilis_ or his First Element: by which he\r\nunderstood a “most subtil matter very swiftly agitated, fluid, and\r\nkeeps to no certain figure, but which suits itself to the figure of\r\nthose bodies that are about it. His Second Element consists of small\r\nGlobules; that is, bodies exactly round and very solid, which do not\r\nonly, like the First Element, fill up the pores of bodies but also\r\nconstitute the purest substance of the Æther and Heaven” (Blome’s\r\ntranslation of Descartes’ “Philosophy,” p. 101; R. Lovett, “The Subtil\r\nMedium Prov’d”; _Phil. Mag._, Vol. XVIII. p. 155).\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1686 and 1687 Newton composed his “Principia,” a\r\nwork which Lagrange pronounced “la plus haute production de l’esprit\r\nhumain”: “the greatest work on science ever produced” (Sir Robt. Ball),\r\nand “which will be memorable not only in the annals of one science or\r\nof one country, but which will form an epoch in the history of the\r\nworld.” This was published at Halley’s expense. As Brewster says (1686,\r\nChap. XII): “It is to Halley alone that science owes this debt of\r\ngratitude. It was he who tracked Newton to his college, who drew from\r\nhim his great discoveries, and who generously gave them to the world.”\r\n\r\nIn the twenty-third proposition of the second book, fifth section,\r\nNewton says: “The virtue of the magnet is contracted by the\r\ninterposition of an iron plate and is almost terminated at it, for\r\nbodies further off are not so much attracted by the magnet as by the\r\niron plate.” And in Book III. prop. vi. he thus expresses himself:\r\n“The magnetic attraction is not as the matter attracted; some bodies\r\nare attracted more by the magnet, others less; most bodies not at all.\r\nThe power of magnetism in one and the same body may be increased and\r\ndiminished, and is sometimes far stronger for the quantity of matter\r\nthan the power of gravity; and in receding from the magnet decreases,\r\nnot in the duplicate, but almost in the triplicate proportion of the\r\ndistance, as nearly as I could judge from some rude observations.”\r\n\r\nNewton is said to have carried in his ring a magnet weighing but three\r\ngrains, which could raise 746 grains, or nearly 250 times its own\r\nweight. This magnet naturally excited much admiration, but is greatly\r\nsurpassed in power by that formerly belonging to Sir John Leslie,\r\nand now in the Physical Collection at Edinburgh, weighing three and\r\none-half grains, and having a carrying power of 1560 grains.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Brewster’s “Life of Sir I.

Works,”\r\nLondon, 1738, with this addition: “One of the compasses, pointing West,\r\nwas brought to New England, where, the glass being broke and the air\r\ngaining entrance, it lost its virtue.

But this kind\r\n   lives especially in the river Itapecuro, in the country of the\r\n   Maragnani, and it is called _Perache_, or, as Gaspar Barlæus\r\n   observed, _Puraquam_, among those Barbarians. In shape and\r\n   greatness it resembles a kind of lamprey (or Muræna); they\r\n   use to kill it by striking it with staves; but the arm of him\r\n   that strikes and then his whole body is stupefied, and shakes\r\n   presently. Of which thing, Frier Christopher Severineus, Bishop\r\n   elect of Angola is my ocular witness....”\r\n\r\n   “Doubt” 7, p. 93. “For it is evident from experience that iron\r\n   is so indisposed by some qualities that it cannot be moved by\r\n   the magnet. That fishes swimming over the _Torpedo_, enclosed in\r\n   the mud or sand for the purpose, when they come to the places\r\n   whereto the virtue of the _Torpedo_ is extended can stir no\r\n   further; by which art she catches and eats them, as Aristotle\r\n   relates (6 ‘de Hist. Animal.,’ cap. 10; and 9 ‘de Hist.,’ cap.\r\n   37).”\r\n\r\n   “Doubt” 7, p. 94. “For if amber be dulled by moisture, its\r\n   virtue cannot produce motion in straws. If the virtue of the\r\n   _Torpedo_ reach the fishes swimming over her, or the\r\n   fisher’s arm their motive power cannot produce motion.”\r\n\r\n   “Doubt” 7, p. 96. “And for this cause, the virtue of the magnet\r\n   can produce motion in iron, not in other bodies, because it\r\n   finds in it Dispositions necessary on the part of the agent\r\n   which, being present, it can operate; not in other things. And,\r\n   for the same reason, amber moves straws, not iron nor stones.”\r\n\r\nThe preface to the “Arbor Vitæ ...” is written by Richard Browner M.L.\r\nColl. Med., London, who translated out of Latin “The Cure of Old Age,”\r\nby Roger Bacon, wherein he gives quite a good account of the latter’s\r\nlife and writings, and from which we extract but one passage likely\r\nhere to be of some little interest, viz. at p. 155, regarding the\r\ncomponent parts of a medicine: “By Amber here our author intends Amber\r\nGryse (a bituminous body found floating on the sea): For he calls it\r\nAmbra and not Succinum (which is solid Amber). Besides, Succinum was\r\nnever reckoned a spice as Amber is here. And though both Ambra and\r\nSuccinum be great restorers of the animal spirits, yet the former is\r\nmore efficacious.”\r\n\r\nThe “Biographie Générale,” Vol. III. p. 348, says that Duarte Madeyra\r\nArraess, who died at Lisbon in 1652, was the author also of “Apologia,”\r\n1638, of “Methodo,” 1642, and of “Novæ Philosophiæ,” 1650.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1683.=--Halley (Edmund), LL.D., who became English astronomer\r\nroyal, makes known his theory of four magnetic poles and of the\r\nperiodical movement of the magnetic line without declination. He states\r\nthat the earth’s magnetism is caused by four poles of attraction,\r\ntwo of them being in each hemisphere near each pole of the earth. By\r\nthe word _pole_ he means a point where the total magnetic force is a\r\nmaximum, or, as he himself styles it, “a point of greatest attraction”\r\n(Walker, “Magnetism,” p. 317, etc.).\r\n\r\nOne of the magnetic poles he places near the meridian of Land’s End,\r\nnot above 7 degrees from the North Pole, the other being about 15\r\ndegrees from the North Pole in the meridian of California, while the\r\ntwo south magnetic poles are placed respectively about 16 and about\r\n20 degrees from the South Pole of the earth, and 95 degrees west, 120\r\ndegrees east of London.\r\n\r\nIn order to test Halley’s theory, the English Government permitted him\r\nto make three voyages in the Atlantic Ocean (1698, 1699, 1702), in\r\nvessels of which he had the command as post-captain. Humboldt states\r\nthat these were the first expeditions equipped by any government for\r\nthe establishment of a great scientific object--that of observing one\r\nof the elements of terrestrial force on which the safety of navigators\r\nis especially dependent.\r\n\r\nThe result of these voyages was the construction of the first accurate\r\nMagnetic Chart, whereon the points at which navigators have found an\r\nequal amount of variation were connected together by curved lines. This\r\nwas the model of all charts of a similar nature since constructed.\r\nHalley remarked upon its completion: “The nice determination of the\r\nvariation, and several other particulars in the magnetic system, is\r\nreserved for a remote posterity. All that we can hope to do is to\r\nleave behind us observations that may be confided in, and to propose\r\nhypotheses which after-ages may examine, amend or refute.”\r\n\r\nSee copy of his chart in Vol. I. No. I of “Terrestrial Magnetism,” also\r\nin Musschenbroek’s “Essais de Physique,” or, preferably, in Bouguer’s\r\n“Traité de Navigation,” where the lines for 1700 are in red ink, while\r\nthose for 1744 are traced in black, thus readily indicating the changes\r\nin the declination.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Cavallo, “Magnetism,” and “Nat. or Exp.

Trans._, No. 347) a distinct\r\nhistory of this phenomenon, which has certainly an electric as well as\r\nmagnetic origin, and to which Gassendi originally gave the name it now\r\nbears, as has been stated at A.D. 1632.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Lardner (“Lectures,” Vol. I. p. 137), Prof. Eberhart,\r\nof Halle, and Paul Frisi, of Pisa, first proposed an explanation of the\r\naurora founded upon the following: 1. Electricity transmitted through\r\nrarefied air exhibits a luminous appearance, precisely similar to\r\nthat of the aurora borealis. 2. The strata of atmospheric air become\r\nrarefied as their altitude above the surface of the earth is increased,\r\na theory which has since been countenanced by many scientists. It has\r\nbeen observed, notably by Dalton, of Manchester, that the primitive\r\nbeams of the aurora are constantly in a direction parallel to that\r\nof the dipping needle, and that the latter appears most affected\r\nwhen the aurora is the brightest. Arago noticed that the changes of\r\ninclination amounted, upon one occasion to 7’ or 8’. The discovery that\r\nthe magnetic needle was agitated during the presence of an aurora has\r\nbeen ascribed to Wargentin (_Am. Journal Sc._, Vol. XXX. p. 227),\r\nthough it is claimed by the friends of Olav Hiörter (see A.D.\r\n1740), that it was independently ascertained by the latter during the\r\nyear 1741.\r\n\r\nThe well-known Swiss chemist Auguste Arthur De la Rive has made many\r\nimportant observations upon the electric character of the aurora,\r\nthe experiments carried on by him in the mountains of Finland being\r\nthus described: “We surrounded the peak of a mountain with copper\r\nwire, pointed at intervals with tin nibs. We next charged the wire\r\nwith electricity, and nearly every night during our stay produced a\r\nyellowish white light on the tin points, in which the spectroscope\r\nanalysis revealed the greenish yellow rays so characteristic of the\r\naurora borealis. On the peak of Pietarintumturi we were especially\r\nsuccessful, an auroral ray making its appearance directly over and\r\nabout 150 yards above the copper coil.”\r\n\r\nA complete list of all auroras appearing prior to 1754 is to be found\r\nin Jean Jacques d’Ortons de Mairan’s, Paris, 1731, “Traité Physique de\r\nl’Aurore Boréale,” and a catalogue of auroræ observed, 1800–1877, has\r\nbeen made up by M. Zenger (_Sci. Am. Supp._, p. 10915). One of the most\r\ninteresting displays is known as the _purple aurora_, alluded to in the\r\nAnnals of Clan-mac-noise as having appeared A.D. 688 (Biot “Note sur la\r\ndirection,” etc., _Comptes Rendus_, Tome XIX for 1844, p. 822). Between\r\nSeptember 19, 1838, and April 8, 1839, Lottin, Bravais, Lilliehöök\r\nand Siljeström observed 160 auroras at Bossekop (69° 58’ N. lat.)\r\nin Finmark and at Jupvig (70° 6’ N. lat.); they were most frequent\r\nduring the period the sun remained below the horizon, that is, from\r\nNovember 17 to January 25. During this night of 70 times 24 hours there\r\nwere 64 auroras visible (_Comptes Rendus_, Tome X. p. 289; Martin,\r\n“Météorologie,” 1843, p. 453; Argelander, in the “Vorträgen geh. in der\r\nKönigsberg Gesellschaft,” Bd. I. s. 259).\r\n\r\nA Finnish physicist, named S. Lenström, who had been attached to the\r\nNordenskjold Polar Expedition of 1868, visited Lapland in 1871, and,\r\nafter a series of important observations, constructed an apparatus that\r\npermitted him to “artificially reproduce the light of the aurora.” The\r\nintensity of this light is so great at times that Lowenörn perceived\r\nthe coruscations in bright sunshine on the 29th of January, 1786, and\r\nParry saw the aurora throughout the day during the voyage of 1821–1823.\r\n\r\nThe height of the aurora has been variously estimated, but it is seldom\r\nfound to be less than forty-five miles above the surface of the earth.\r\nFather Boscovich estimated at 825 miles the height of the one observed\r\nby the Marquis of Poleni on the 16th of December, 1737. The extent of\r\nthe aurora, according to Dalton, has been known to cover an area of\r\n7000 or 8000 square miles.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Mem. de Turin,” An. 1784–5, Vol. I. part ii. pp.\r\n   328, 338; Young, “Lectures,” Vol. I. pp. 687, 716; Herschel,\r\n   “Prelim.

Thomson attribute\r\nto it any electric or magnetic origin.\r\n\r\nIn the _Report of the Proceedings of the Reale Istituto Lombardo_,\r\n1876, however, appears the account of many observations confirmed by\r\nM. Serpieri which “demand absolutely” the conclusion that the zodiacal\r\nlight “is an electrical aurora preceding and following the sun round\r\nthe earth.”\r\n\r\nAngstrom asserted that he observed the auroral line in the spectrum of\r\nthe zodiacal light, and Lewis saw the latter during the aurora of May\r\n2, 1877. Humboldt, who observed it (“Cosmos,” 1849, Vol. I. p. 126) in\r\nthe Andes at an elevation of 13,000 to 15,000 feet, as well as on “the\r\nboundless grassy plains, the Llanos of Venezuela, and on the seashore,\r\nbeneath the ever-clear sky of Cumana,” believes it to be caused by “a\r\nvery compressed annulus of nebulous matter, revolving freely in space\r\nbetween the orbits of Venus and Mars.” In this connection he refers to\r\nArago in the _Annuaire_ for 1832, p. 246, and to a letter published\r\nin _Comptes Rendus_, XVI, 1843, p. 687, from which the following is\r\nextracted: “Several physical facts appear to indicate that, in a\r\nmechanical separation of matter into its smallest particles, if the\r\nmass be very small in relation to the surface, the electrical tension\r\nmay increase sufficiently for the production of light and heat.”\r\n\r\nIn Chambers’ “Descript. Astronomy,” p. 257, the historian Nicephorus\r\nis credited with first calling attention to the existence of this\r\nphenomenon, to which Giovanni Domenico Cassini gave the name of\r\nZodiacal Light, after determining its relations in space during the\r\nyear 1683 (_Mém. de l’Académie_, 1730, Tome VIII. pp. 188 and 276),\r\nbut to Childrey belongs the credit of having given to Europe the\r\nfirst explicit description of this phenomenon at p. 183 of his 1661\r\n“Britannia Baconica.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Sturgeon’s _Annals_, etc., Vol. II. pp. 140–142;\r\n   Prof. C.

In the daytime these devices were\r\ndrawn up by a rope behind the screen and made visible in the open\r\nspace, while during the night use was made of torches, lanterns or\r\nlights.\r\n\r\nHooke also showed, in 1684, that iron and steel rods can be permanently\r\nmagnetized by strongly heating them and by rapidly cooling them in the\r\nmagnetic meridian (“Enc. Brit.” 1857, Vol. XIV. p. 3).\r\n\r\nBut, what is still more singular, he had, even previous to the\r\nabove-named date (_i. e._ in 1667), alluded to the possibility\r\nof telephoning, that is, communicating sound through a wire. He thus\r\nexpresses himself: “And as glasses have highly promoted our seeing,\r\nso it is not improbable that there may be found many mechanical\r\ninventions to improve our other senses--of hearing, smelling, tasting,\r\ntouching.... ’Tis not impossible to hear a whisper a furlong’s\r\ndistance, it having been already done; and perhaps the nature of the\r\nthing would not make it more impossible though that furlong should be\r\nten times multiplied. And though some famous authors have affirmed\r\nit impossible to hear through the thinnest plates of Muscovy glass,\r\nI know a way by which it is easy to hear one speak through a wall\r\na yard thick. It has not been examined how far acoustics may be\r\nimproved, nor what other ways there may be of quickening our hearing,\r\nor conveying sound through other bodies than the air, for that is not\r\nthe only medium. I can assure the reader that I have, by the help of a\r\ndistended wire, propagated the sound to a very considerable distance\r\nin an instant, or with as seemingly quick a motion as that of light,\r\nat least, incomparably swifter than that which at the same time was\r\npropagated through the air; and this not only in a straight line, or\r\ndirect, but in one bended in many angles.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Hooke’s entire paper in Derham’s “Phil.

For this purpose they made a three-footed\r\nstool ... upon which, having laid a basin of divers metals, they placed\r\nthe twenty-four letters of the alphabet around it; then one of these\r\nphilosophers, who was a magician ... holding in one hand vervain and in\r\nthe other a ring which hung at the end of a small thread, pronounced\r\n... conjurations ... at which the three-footed stool turning around and\r\nthe ring moving of itself, and turning from one side to the other over\r\nthe letters, it caused them to fall upon the table ... which foretold\r\nthem ... that the Furies were waiting for the emperor at Mimas; ...\r\nafter which the enchanted ring, turning about again over the letters in\r\norder to express the name of him who should succeed the emperor, formed\r\nfirst of all these capital letters, T H E O. After adding a D, to form\r\nT H E O D, the ring stopped, and was not seen to move any more, at\r\nwhich one of the assistants cried out ... ‘Theodorus is the person whom\r\nthe gods appoint for our emperor’” (“History of Christianity,” by the\r\nRev.

It was then observed\r\nthat the iron cross was covered with a heavy coating of rust, which\r\nlatter proved to be so highly magnetic that a special report upon it\r\nwas made in the “Journal des Sçavans” by M. de la Hire, December 3,\r\n1691, at the request of Giovanni Dom.

Reasons of these experiments. The earth magnetical.”\r\n\r\nIn explanation of all this, M. de la Hire supposes “that the mass of\r\nthe earth is a great loadstone, which directs the poles of the same\r\nname in all the loadstones and touch’d needles, towards the same place\r\nof the earth; so that the two hang’d needles do but remove from this\r\nnatural position by the particular force they have of driving away\r\neach other’s poles of the same name; which force, in a certain degree,\r\nis not sufficient to overcome the power of the great loadstone of the\r\nearth.”\r\n\r\nAn account of M.

Physica de Mercurio Lucente,” etc., Basel, 1719). This procured\r\nthe favourable notice of King Frederick I, of Prussia, who rewarded\r\nhim with a medal. John Bernoulli I (1667–1748) was a member of nearly\r\nevery learned society of Europe and “one of the first mathematicians\r\nof a mathematical age.” His exceedingly valuable memoirs, found in all\r\nthe scientific transactions of the day, were first collected in their\r\nentirety during the year 1742, by Cramer, Professor of Mathematics, and\r\npublished at Lausanne and Geneva.\r\n\r\n“Is it not surprising,” remarks Prof. Robison, in his able article on\r\n“Dynamics” (Eighth “Britannica,” Vol. VIII. p. 363), “that, twenty-five\r\nyears after the publication of Newton’s ‘Principia,’ a mathematician on\r\nthe Continent should publish a solution in the Memoirs of the French\r\nAcademy, and boast that he had given the first demonstration of it?\r\nYet, John Bernoulli did this in 1710. Is it not more remarkable that\r\nthis should be precisely the solution given by Newton, beginning from\r\nthe same theorem, the 40th I., Prin., following Newton in every step\r\nand using the same subsidiary lines? Yet, so it is.” This was five\r\nyears after he had accepted (1705) the chair of mathematics made vacant\r\nby the death of his brother, James I.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BERNOULLI FAMILY\r\n\r\nThe Bernoulli family is as well known in the history of mathematics, by\r\nthe distinguished services of eight of its members, as is the Cassini\r\nfamily through the successes achieved by four of its representatives in\r\nthe development of astronomical studies.\r\n\r\nDaniel Bernoulli (1700–1782), second son of John I, constructed a\r\ndipping needle, which is described on p. 85 of the Eighth “Britannica,”\r\nVol. XIV, and with which he observed the dip to diminish half a degree\r\nduring an earthquake in the year 1767. Before Daniel was twenty-four\r\nyears old he had declined the Presidency of the Academy of Sciences\r\nat Genoa, and, at the age of twenty-five, was appointed Professor of\r\nMathematics at St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nJohn Bernoulli II (1710–1790), youngest of the three sons of John I,\r\ngained three prizes from the French Academy of Sciences for Memoirs on\r\nthe Capstan, on the Propagation of Light and on the Magnet.\r\n\r\nJohn Bernoulli III (1744–1807), grandson of John I, took the degree of\r\nDoctor of Philosophy at the age of thirteen, and, when nineteen years\r\nold, was appointed Astronomer Royal of Berlin. He published several\r\nvolumes of travels, in one of which he relates (A. L. Ternant, “Le\r\nTélégraphe,” 1881, p. 32) that he saw, in the last-named city, an\r\ninstrument constructed of five bells, with which all letters of the\r\nalphabet could be expressed.\r\n\r\nJames Bernoulli I (1654–1705), brother of John I, while at London, was\r\nintroduced into the philosophical meetings of Boyle, Hooke, Edward\r\nStillingfleet and other learned and scientific men. He opened, in\r\n1682, the _Collegium Experimentale Physico-Mechanicum_ for public\r\ninstruction, but his lasting fame dates from the year 1684, when the\r\ngreat Von Leibnitz published his treatise “De Gravitate Ætheris.” Three\r\nyears later, in 1687, James occupied the mathematical chair of the\r\nUniversity of Basel, made vacant by the death of the learned Megerlin.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Whewell, “Hist. of the Inductive Sciences,” 1859,\r\n   Vol. I. pp. 358–366, 375–380, 393, 430, and Vol. II. pp. 32–39,\r\n   42; “Hist. de l’Acad.

He shows that a considerable\r\nquantity of light can be produced by agitating mercury in partly\r\nexhausted as well as in thoroughly exhausted glass vessels. When the\r\nmercury is made to break into a shower, flashes of light are seen to\r\nstart everywhere “in as strange a form as lightning.”\r\n\r\nHe also showed light _in vacuo_ produced by rubbing amber and by\r\nrubbing glass upon woollen. He says (Priestley, “Hist. and Present\r\nState of Electricity,” London, 1775, p. 19) that every fresh glass\r\nfirst gave a purple and then a pale light, and that woollen, tinctured\r\nwith salt or spirits, produced a new, strong and fulgurating light.\r\n\r\nHauksbee constructed a powerful electrical machine wherein the Von\r\nGuericke sulphur globe was replaced by one of glass, as had already\r\nbeen done by Sir Isaac Newton (at A.D. 1675). With it he found\r\nthat upon exhausting the air, whirling the globe rapidly and placing\r\nhis hand upon the outside, a strong light appeared upon the interior,\r\nand that the light would show itself also upon the outside when air was\r\nlet into the globe (“Physico-Mech. Exp.,” pp. 12, 14, 26, 32, 34).\r\n\r\nThe machine, which the celebrated mechanician Leupold had constructed\r\nat Leipzig for Mr. Wolfius, only differed from the original one made\r\nby Hauksbee in that the glass globe turned vertically instead of\r\nhorizontally.\r\n\r\nOther experiments with coated glass globes, globes of sulphur, etc.,\r\nare detailed in the “Physico-Mech.

And if a loadstone be put\r\ninto the fire, insomuch that the internal structure of the parts be\r\nchanged or wholly destroyed, then it will lose all its former virtue\r\nand will scarce differ from other stones.... And what some generally\r\nboast of, concerning effluvia, a subtile matter, particles adapted to\r\nthe pores of the loadstone, etc., does not in the least lead us to a\r\nclear and distinct explication of these operations; but notwithstanding\r\nall these things, the magnetick virtues must be still reckoned amongst\r\nthe occult qualities.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1706.=--Hartsoeker (Nicolas), Dutch natural philosopher, friend\r\nof Christian Huyghens, while Professor of Mathematics at Düsseldorf,\r\nwrites his “Conjectures Physiques,” four editions of which were\r\npublished during the three years 1708, 1710 and 1712.\r\n\r\nThe Tenth Discourse of the Second Book (pp. 140–182) treats of the\r\nnature and properties of the loadstone and gives numerous observations\r\nconcerning magnetical phenomena, which are well illustrated.

He believes\r\nthat the native loadstone is made up of ordinary stone and of iron\r\ncontaining many small bodies through which run magnetic channels;\r\nthat the latter are held together so strongly as to be disintegrated\r\nwith difficulty, and that they are filled with a subtile matter which\r\ncirculates incessantly through and around them.\r\n\r\nThe First Discourse of the Fourth Book treats of Meteors, and at pp.\r\n91–99 of his “Eclaircissements, ...” published in 1710 he gives further\r\nreports of his curious observations on magnetic phenomena.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Journal des Sçavans,” Vol. XXIV for 1696, pp.\r\n   649–656.\r\n\r\n   For particulars of the very celebrated natural philosopher,\r\n   Christian Huyghens--Hugenius van Zuglichen (1629–1695) above\r\n   alluded to, consult: the “Vita Hugenii,” prefixed to his\r\n   “Opera Varia,” published by Van ’Sgravesande in 1724; “Meyer’s\r\n   Konversations-Lexikon,” Leipzig und Wien, 1895, Vol. IX. pp.\r\n   93–94, also the biography, embracing a detailed list of his\r\n   geometrical, mechanical, astronomical and optical works at pp.\r\n   536–538 of the “English Cyclopædia”; Vol. II. of Houzeau et\r\n   Lancaster, “Bibliog.

He next discovered that\r\nelectricity can be communicated from excited bodies to bodies\r\nincapable of ready excitation. When first suspending a hempen line with\r\npack threads he could not transmit electricity, but when suspending\r\nthe line with silken threads he transmitted the electrical influence\r\nseveral hundred feet. The latter he did at the suggestion of his friend\r\nGranville Wheeler--Wheler--(not Checler, as Aglave et Boulard have it\r\nin “Lumière Electrique,” p. 20), thinking that “silk might do better\r\nthan pack thread on account of its smallness, as less of the virtue\r\nwould probably pass off by it than by the thickness of the hempen line\r\nwhich had been previously used.” They both tried experiments with\r\nlonger lines of pack thread, but failed, as they likewise did after\r\nsubstituting thin brass wire for the thread. This afterwards led to the\r\ndiscovery of other insulating substances, like hair, resin, etc. During\r\nthe months of June 1729, and August 1730, Grey and Wheeler succeeded in\r\ntransmitting electricity through pack thread supported by silken cords\r\na distance of 765 feet, and through wire at a distance of 800–886 feet.\r\n\r\nGrey demonstrated also that electric attraction is not proportioned to\r\nthe quantity of matter in bodies, but to the extent of their surface,\r\nand he likewise discovered the conducting powers of fluids and of\r\nthe human body. Of the cracklings and flashes of light he remarks:\r\n“And although these effects are at present but _in minimis_,\r\nit is probable, in time, there may be found out a way to collect a\r\ngreater quantity of the electric fire, and consequently to increase\r\nthe force of that power, which by several of those experiments, if we\r\nare permitted to compare great things with small, seems to be of the\r\nsame nature with that of thunder and lightning” (_Phil. Trans._,\r\nabridgment of John Martyn, Vol. VIII. p. 401).\r\n\r\nStephen Grey may be said to have continued his experiments while lying\r\nupon his death-bed, for, unable to write, he dictated to the last, as\r\nbest he could, the progress he had made in his studies to Dr. Mortimer,\r\nthe Secretary of the Royal Society (_Phil. Trans._, 1735–1736,\r\nVol. XXXIX. p. 400).\r\n\r\nGrey’s own description of a new electric planetarium deserves\r\nreproduction here: “I have lately made several new experiments upon\r\nthe projectile and pendulous motions of small bodies by electricity;\r\nby which small bodies may be made to move about larger ones, either\r\nin circles or ellipses, and those either concentric or excentric to\r\nthe centre of the large body about which they move, so as to make many\r\nrevolutions about them. And this motion will constantly be the same way\r\nthat the planets move around the sun, viz. from the right hand to the\r\nleft, or from west to east. But these little planets, if I may so call\r\nthem, move much faster in their apogeon than in the perigeon part of\r\ntheir orbits, which is directly contrary to the motion of the planets\r\naround the sun.” To this should be added the following description of\r\nthe manner in which these experiments can be made: “Place a small iron\r\nglobe, of an inch or an inch and a half in diameter, on the middle of\r\na circular cake of rosin, seven or eight inches in diameter, greatly\r\nexcited; and then a light body, suspended by a very fine thread, five\r\nor six inches long, held in the hand over the centre of the cake,\r\nwill, of itself, begin to move in a circle around the iron globe, and\r\nconstantly from west to east. If the globe is placed at any distance\r\nfrom the centre of the circular cake, it will describe an ellipse,\r\nwhich will have the same excentricity as the distance of the globe\r\nfrom the centre of the cake. If the cake of rosin be of an elliptical\r\nform, and the iron globe be placed in the centre of it, the light body\r\nwill describe an elliptical orbit of the same excentricity with the\r\nform of the cake. If the globe be placed in or near one of the foci\r\nof the elliptical cake, the light body will move much swifter in the\r\napogee than in the perigee of its orbit. If the iron globe is fixed on\r\na pedestal an inch from the table, and a glass hoop, or a portion of\r\na hollow glass cylinder, excited, be placed around it, the light body\r\nwill move as in the circumstance above mentioned, and with the same\r\nvarieties.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Priestley, “Hist. and Present State of Elec.,”\r\n   1775, pp. 26–42, 55–63; and “A New Universal History of Arts and\r\n   Sciences,” _Electricity_, Vol. I. p. 460; _Saturday Review_,\r\n   August 21, 1858, p. 190; Wilson, “Treatise,” 1752, Section IV.\r\n   prop. i. p. 23, note; _Phil.

Trans._, No. 368.\r\n\r\nIn order to arrive at a proper determination of the laws of magnetic\r\nforce, Dr. Taylor--and also Whiston and Hauksbee--according to Sir\r\nDavid Brewster, considered “the deviation of a compass needle from the\r\nmeridian, produced by the action of a magnet at different distances;\r\nand the conclusion which they all drew from their experiments was that\r\nthe magnetic force was proportional to the sines of half the arcs of\r\ndeviation, or nearly in the inverse sesqui-duplicate ratio of the\r\ndistance, or as the square roots of the fifth powers of the distances.\r\nDr. Taylor had already come to the conclusion that the force was\r\ndifferent in various magnets, and decreased quicker at great distances\r\nthan at small ones, an experimental fact, as shown by Sir W. S. Harris,\r\n‘Rud. Mag.,’ Part III. p. 224.”\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Thomas Thomson’s “History of the Royal Society” we read, however\r\n(p. 461), that Brooke Taylor, and after him Musschenbroek, attempted\r\nwithout success to determine by experiment the rate at which the\r\nmagnetic attractions and repulsions vary. This rate was successfully\r\ninvestigated by the subsequent experiments of Lambert, Robison and\r\nCoulomb. The nature of magnetic curves was first satisfactorily\r\nexplained by Lambert, Robison and Playfair. Brooke Taylor gave four\r\npoles to a wire by touching it at one end or at various parts, as\r\nindicated in _Phil.

He finds\r\nthat its northern extremity begins to move westward at about seven\r\nor eight o’clock in the morning, and continues to deviate in that\r\ndirection until about two o’clock in the afternoon, when it becomes\r\nstationary; it soon begins to return to the eastward and becomes\r\nagain stationary during the night. Graham made nearly a thousand\r\nobservations, between the 6th of February and the 12th of May, 1722,\r\nand found that the greatest westerly variation was 14° 45’, and the\r\nleast 13° 50’; in general, however, it varied between 14° and 14° 35’,\r\ngiving 35’ for the amount of the daily variation.\r\n\r\nGraham’s discovery--afterwards amplified by Anders Celsius\r\n(A.D. 1740)--attracted but little attention until 1750, when\r\nthe subject was ably taken up by Wargentin, Secretary to the Swedish\r\nAcademy of Sciences. Between 1750 and 1759 Mr. John Canton made about\r\n4000 observations on the same subject, and was followed by the Dutch\r\nscientist Gerard van Swieten, the favourite pupil of Boerhaave, with\r\nlike results.\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Lardner states (“Lectures on Science and Art,” 1859, Vol. II.\r\np. 115), the same phenomenon has been observed more recently by Col.\r\nBeaufoy (at A.D. 1813), by Prof. Hansteen (at A.D. 1819) and by many\r\nothers. He further states that Cassini, who observed the _diurnal_\r\nvariation of the needle at Paris, found that neither the solar heat nor\r\nlight influenced it, for it was the same in the deep caves constructed\r\nunder the Observatory in Paris, where a sensibly constant temperature\r\nis preserved, and from which light is excluded, as at the surface. In\r\nnorthern regions these diurnal changes are greater and more irregular;\r\nwhile, toward the line, their amplitudes are gradually diminished until\r\nat length they disappear altogether.\r\n\r\nIt was Graham who first entertained the idea of measuring the magnetic\r\nintensity through the vibrations of the needle, a method subsequently\r\nused by Coulomb, and which many believe was invented by the latter.\r\nFrom the observations made by Humboldt and by Gay-Lussac in this\r\nmanner, Biot has reduced the variation of intensity in different\r\nlatitudes.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“_Am.

In\r\nconnection with the increased energy which magnets acquire by being\r\narmed, that is, fitted with a cap of polished iron at each pole, Dr.\r\nWhewell remarks that it is only at a later period any notice was taken\r\n“of the distinction which exists between the magnetical properties of\r\nsoft iron and of hard steel; the latter being susceptible of being\r\nformed into _artificial magnets_, with permanent poles; while soft\r\niron is only _passively magnetic_, receiving a temporary polarity\r\nfrom the action of a magnet near it, but losing this property when the\r\nmagnet is removed. About the middle of the last century various methods\r\nwere devised of making artificial magnets, which exceeded in power all\r\nmagnetic bodies previously known” (“Hist. of the Ind. Sc.,” 1859, Vol.\r\nII. p. 220).\r\n\r\nHamilton alludes to a loadstone weighing 139 grains, with a lifting\r\npower of 23,760 grains! We have referred, amongst others, to the\r\nloadstone belonging to Sir Isaac Newton at A.D. 1675, and to\r\nthe wonderful collection belonging to Mr. Butterfield at A.D.\r\n1809. A loadstone weighing twelve ounces, capable of lifting sixty\r\npounds of iron, is referred to in Terzagus, “Musæum Septalianum,” 1664,\r\np. 42, while another weighing two and a half grains and lifting 783\r\ngrains is mentioned at p. 272, Vol. III. of the “Records of General\r\nScience”; and Salviatus (“Dialogues of Galileo,” Dial.

II, IV and V he discourses about the extent of the magnetic\r\nfluid and explains the phenomena of meteors, St. Elmo’s fire, thunder,\r\netc., besides recording the experiments of Grey, Dufay and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1733.=--Dufay (Charles François de Cisternay), French scientist\r\nand superintendent of the _Jardin du Roi_, now the _Jardin des\r\nPlantes_, of Paris (in which latter position he was succeeded by\r\nBuffon), communicates to the French Academy of Sciences the history of\r\nelectricity brought down to the year 1732 (_Dantzig Memoirs_, Vol. I.\r\np. 195).\r\n\r\nHe is said to have originated the theory of two kinds of electricity\r\npermeating matter and producing all the known phenomena of attraction,\r\nrepulsion and induction, though the honour of this important discovery\r\nshould be shared by M. White, who was associated at one time with\r\nStephen Grey and who, it appears, independently discovered the fact\r\nwhile in England. Dufay thus announces his discovery: “... there are\r\ntwo kinds of electricity, very different from one another, one of\r\nwhich I call _vitreous_ (positive) and the other _resinous_ (negative)\r\nelectricity. The first is that of glass, rock crystal, precious stones,\r\nhairs of animals, wool and many other bodies. The second is that of\r\namber, copal, gum-lac, silk, thread, paper and a vast number of other\r\nsubstances. The characteristics of these two electricities are that\r\nthey repel themselves and attract each other. Thus a body of the\r\nvitreous electricity repels all other bodies possessed of the vitreous,\r\nand, on the contrary, attracts all those of the resinous electricity.\r\nThe resinous also repels the resinous and attracts the vitreous. From\r\nthis principle one may easily deduce the explanation of a great number\r\nof the phenomena; and it is probable that this truth will lead us to\r\nthe discovery of many other things” (see Franklin, at A.D. 1752, and\r\nSymmer, at A.D. 1759).\r\n\r\nUpon repeating Grey’s experiments, Dufay observed, amongst other\r\nthings, that, by wetting pack thread, electricity was more readily\r\ntransmitted through it, and he was enabled thus easily to convey the\r\nfluid a distance of 1256 feet, though the wind was high and although\r\nthe line made eight returns.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Fontenelle, “Eloge”; Priestley, “History and\r\n   Present State of Electricity,” 1775, Period IV. pp. 43–54;\r\n   Sturgeon, _Lectures_, 1842, p. 23; “An Epitome of El. and Mag.,”\r\n   Philad., 1809, p. 29; _Mém. de l’Acad.

In the “Principia” Part I. chap. ix.,\r\nis to be found his treatment of what he calls the second or magnetic\r\nelement of the world; in Part III. chap. i. he gives a comparison of\r\nthe sidereal heaven with the magnetic sphere, but he devotes the whole\r\nof Part II to the magnet in following chapters:\r\n\r\n   I. On the causes and mechanism of the magnetic forces;\r\n\r\n   II. On the attractive forces of two or more magnets, and the\r\n   ratio of the forces to the distances;\r\n\r\n   III. On the attractive forces of two magnets when their poles\r\n   are alternated;\r\n\r\n   IV. On the attractive forces of two magnets when their axes\r\n   are parallel or when the equinoctial of the one lies upon the\r\n   equinoctial of the other;\r\n\r\n   V. On the disjunctive and repulsive forces of two or more\r\n   magnets when the cognomical or inimical poles are applied to\r\n   each other;\r\n\r\n   VI. On the attractive forces of the magnet and of iron;\r\n\r\n   VII. On the influence of the magnet upon ignited iron;\r\n\r\n   VIII. On the quantity of exhalations from the magnet and their\r\n   penetration through hard bodies, etc.;\r\n\r\n   IX. On the various modes of destroying the power of the magnet;\r\n   and on the chemical experiments made with it;\r\n\r\n   X. On the friction of the magnet against iron, and on the force\r\n   communicated from the former to the latter;\r\n\r\n   XI. On the conjunctive force of the magnet, as exercised upon\r\n   several pieces of iron;\r\n\r\n   XII. On the operation of iron and of the magnet upon the\r\n   mariner’s needle; and on the reciprocal operation of one needle\r\n   upon another;\r\n\r\n   XIII. On other methods of making iron magnetical;\r\n\r\n   XIV. The declination of the magnet calculated upon the foregoing\r\n   principles;\r\n\r\n   XV. On the causes of the magnetic declination;\r\n\r\n   XVI.

He also\r\nalludes to the variation charts of Dr. Halley and to the alterations\r\ntherein made by advice of William Mountaine and Jacob Dooson--James\r\nDodson--of London, as well as to the methods of ascertaining the\r\nvariation of the magnetic needle pointed out both by Manuel de\r\nFigueyredo, at Chaps. IX-X of his “Hidrographie ou Examen des Pilotes,”\r\nprinted at Lisbon in 1608, and by Don Lazare de Flores at Chap. I, part\r\nii. of his “Art de Naviguer,” printed in 1672. The latter, he says,\r\nasserts, in Chap. IX, that the Portuguese find his method so reliable\r\nthat they embody it in all the instructions given for the navigation of\r\ntheir vessels.\r\n\r\nAt pp. 66, 67, Chap. X of vol. ii. Ulloa makes the earliest recorded\r\nreference to the _aurora australis_, as follows: “At half-past\r\nten in the evening, and as we stood about two leagues from the island\r\nof _Tierra de Juan Fernandez_, we observed upon the summit of a\r\nneighbouring mountain a very brilliant and extraordinary light....\r\nI saw it very distinctly from its inception, and I noticed that it\r\nwas very small at first, and gradually extended until it looked like\r\na large, lighted torch. This lasted three or four minutes, when the\r\nlight began to diminish as gradually as it had grown, and finally\r\ndisappeared.”\r\n\r\nIncidentally, it may be stated here that the very learned Dr. John\r\nDalton reported having seen the _aurora australis_ in England, and to\r\nhave besides observed the _aurora borealis_ as far as 45° latitude\r\nsouth (see accounts in _Philosophical Transactions_, _Philosophical\r\nMagazine_, _Manchester Transactions_ and _Nicholson’s Journal_), while\r\nHumboldt remarks (“Cosmos,” 1849, Vol. I. p. 192, note) that in south\r\npolar bands, composed of very delicate clouds, observed by Arago,\r\nat Paris, on the 23rd of June, 1844, dark rays shot upward from an\r\narch running east and west, and that he had already made mention of\r\nblack rays resembling dark smoke, as occurring in brilliant nocturnal\r\nnorthern lights.\r\n\r\nReferences to the _aurora australis_ are made by the naturalist John\r\nReinhold Forster, in the article on “Aurora Borealis” of the “Encycl.\r\nBritannica.”\r\n\r\nFor Mountaine and Dodson, consult the _Phil.

The latter was at\r\nfirst supported by a man insulated upon cakes of resin and afterward\r\nsuspended by silken strings. M. Boze discovered that capillary tubes\r\ndischarging water by drops give a continuous run when electrified.

Trans._ for 1739. Some of\r\nthese experiments were made on the 15th of April, 1738, at H.R.H. the\r\nPrince of Wales’ house at Cliefden.\r\n\r\nHe was the first to divide bodies into “electrics,” or non-conductors,\r\nand “non-electrics,” or conductors. He ranked pure _air_ amongst\r\nhis electrics (Tyndall, Lecture I) and stated that “cold air in frosty\r\nweather, when vapours rise least of all, is preferable for electrical\r\npurposes to warm air in summer, when the heat raises the vapours”\r\n(_Phil. Trans._, John Martyn abridgment, Vol. VIII. p. 437).\r\nIt was Desaguliers who announced that he could render bars of iron\r\nmagnetic, either by striking them sharply against the ground while in\r\na vertical position or by striking them with a hammer when placed at\r\nright angles to the magnetic meridian.\r\n\r\nHis “Dissertation Concerning Electricity” London, 1742, which won for\r\nhim the grand prize of the Bordeaux Academy, is said to be the second\r\nwork on the subject published in the English language, the first\r\nhaving been Boyle’s “Mechanical Origin and Production of Electricity,”\r\nmentioned at A.D. 1675.\r\n\r\nDesaguliers was the second to receive the Copley medal, it having been\r\npreviously bestowed by the Royal Society only upon Stephen Grey, who\r\nobtained it in 1731 and 1732 for his “New Electrical Experiments.” The\r\nlist of recipients of this distinguished honour, given by C. R. Weld\r\nat p. 385, Vol. I of the “History of the Royal Society,” shows that\r\nDesaguliers received _three_ Copley medals; these were awarded him\r\nduring the years 1734, 1736 and 1741, for his “Experiments in Natural\r\nPhilosophy.” John Canton was given two of the medals, in 1751 and 1764,\r\nthe only other electrician similarly favoured being Michael Faraday,\r\nwho received them during the years 1832 and 1838, while Sir Humphry\r\nDavy is credited with only one, conferred upon him in 1805.\r\n\r\n    “Can Britain ...\r\n    ... Permit the weeping muse to tell\r\n    How poor neglected Desaguliers fell?\r\n    How he, who taught two gracious kings to view,\r\n    All Boyle ennobled, and all Bacon knew,\r\n    Died in a cell, without a friend to save,\r\n    Without a guinea, and without a grave?”\r\n\r\n    Cawthorn, “Vanity of Human Enjoyments,” V. 147–154.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1742, Desaguliers received the prize of the _Académie\r\nRoyale de Bordeaux_ for a treatise on the electricity of bodies,\r\nwhich latter was separately published at the time in a quarto volume of\r\ntwenty-eight pages. The same Academy had previously conferred important\r\nprizes for dissertations, upon the nature of thunder and lightning\r\nby Louis Antoine Lozeran du Fech in 1726, upon the variations of the\r\nmagnetic needle by Nicolas Sarrabat in 1727, and also subsequently\r\ndecreed similar awards, to Laurent Béraud for an essay on magnets in\r\n1748, to Denis Barberet for a treatise on atmospherical electricity in\r\n1750, and to Samuel Theodor Quellmalz for a dissertation on medical\r\nelectricity in 1753.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Phil.

In this illustration a lady is pressing her hand against the\r\nglass globe, which is being rotated rapidly, thus developing upon its\r\nsurface the vitreous electricity, while the resinous electricity passes\r\nthrough her body to the earth. The young man who is suspended and\r\ninsulated by silken cords, represents the prime conductor introduced\r\nby Prof. Boze (A.D. 1738). The vitreous electricity passes\r\nfrom the surface of the glass globe, through his feet and entire body,\r\nand is communicated by his hand to the young girl, who stands upon a\r\nlarge section of resin, and is able to attract small parcels of gold\r\nleaf by means of the electric fluid. Another machine, taken from the\r\nsame French work (originally published at Paris in 1748), is said to\r\nhave been at that time much in use throughout Holland and principally\r\nat Amsterdam. The man rotates a glass globe, against which the operator\r\npresses his hand, and the electricity is conveyed through the metallic\r\nrod supported by silk-covered stands and held by a third party, who is\r\nigniting spirits in the manner indicated at the A.D. 1744 date.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCE.--_Dantzig Memoirs_, Vol. I. pp. 278, 279.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1743.=--Boerhaave--Boerhaaven--(Hermann), illustrious\r\nphysician, mathematician and natural philosopher (1668–1738), who\r\nheld the chairs of theoretical medicine, practical medicine, botany\r\nand chemistry at the University of Leyden, F.R.S. and member French\r\nAcademy of Sciences, writes an Essay on the virtue of Magnetical Cures,\r\nof which there were subsequently many editions and translations in\r\ndifferent languages.\r\n\r\nOne of his biographers calls him “the Galen, the Ibn Sina, the Fernel\r\nof his age.” Another remarks that he was, perhaps, the greatest\r\nphysician of modern times: “A man who, when we contemplate his genius,\r\nhis erudition, the singular variety of his talents, his unfeigned\r\npiety, his spotless character, and the impress which he left not only\r\non contemporaneous practice, but on that of succeeding generations,\r\nstands forth as one of the brightest names on the page of medical\r\nhistory, and may be quoted as an example not only to physicians, but\r\nto mankind at large. No professor was ever attended, in public as well\r\nas at private lectures, by so great a number of students, from such\r\ndistant and different parts, for so many years successively; none heard\r\nhim without conceiving a veneration for his person, at the same time\r\nthat they expressed their surprise at his prodigious attainments; and\r\nit may be justly affirmed, that none in so private a station ever\r\nattracted a more universal esteem.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Biographica Philosophica,” Benj.

Bishop Wilkins alludes to this machine as well as\r\nto a brazen head devised by Friar Bacon, which could be made to utter\r\ncertain words (“Journal des Savants” for 1899, and J. S. Brewer, “F.\r\nRog.

G. Kratzenstein, etc.\r\n\r\nTwo more curious productions, in pretty much the same line as\r\nBergerac’s, can, with equal propriety, be inserted here.\r\n\r\nThe first is taken from the April number, 1632, of the _Courier\r\nVéritable_, a little monthly publication in which novel fancies were\r\nfrequently aired: “Captain Vosterloch has returned from his voyage to\r\nthe southern lands, which he started on two years and a half ago, by\r\norder of the States-General. He tells us, among other things, that\r\nin passing through a strait below Magellan’s, he landed in a country\r\nwhere Nature has furnished men with a kind of sponge which holds sounds\r\nand articulations as our sponges hold liquids. So, when they wish to\r\ndispatch a message to a distance, they speak to one of the sponges, and\r\nthen send it to their friends. They, receiving the sponges, take them\r\nup gently and press out the words that have been spoken into them, and\r\nlearn by this admirable means all that their correspondents desire them\r\nto know.”\r\n\r\nThe second is the production of one Thomas Ward, theological poet, who\r\nwas born in 1640 and died in 1704.

In order to\r\nascertain whether an exhausted tube would give light when it was\r\nelectrified, as well as when it was excited, he presented one eight\r\ninches long and a third of an inch wide, to the electrified conductor,\r\nand was surprised to find the light dart very vividly along the entire\r\nlength of the tube. He likewise observed that some time after the tube\r\nhad been presented to the conductor, and exposed to nothing but the\r\nair, it gave light again without being brought to an electrified body\r\n(see _Dantzig Memoirs_, Vol. I. p. 417).\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1745.=--Dr. Miles (Rev.

This gentleman’s\r\ntube happening to be in excellent order upon this occasion, he\r\nobserved, and doubtless was the first to notice, _pencils of luminous\r\nrays_, which he called _coruscations_, darting from the tube without\r\nthe aid of any conductor approaching it.\r\n\r\nIn a paper which Dr. Miles read before the same Society on the 25th\r\nof January, 1746, he gave an account of other equally interesting\r\nexperiments, one of which was the kindling of ordinary lamp spirits\r\nwith a piece of black sealing wax excited by dry flannel or white and\r\nbrown paper.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Dict.

It was first announced in a letter\r\nto Von Kleist, dean of the cathedral of Kamin--Cammin--in Pomerania,\r\ndated the 4th of November, 1745, and addressed to Dr. Lieberkühn, who\r\ncommunicated it to the Berlin Academy. The following is an extract:\r\n“When a nail or a piece of thick brass wire is put into a small\r\napothecary’s phial and electrified, remarkable effects follow; but\r\nthe phial must be very dry or warm; I commonly rub it over beforehand\r\nwith a finger, on which I put some pounded chalk. If a little mercury,\r\nor a few drops of spirit of wine, be put into it, the experiment\r\nsucceeds the better. As soon as this phial and nail are removed from\r\nthe electrifying glass, or the prime conductor to which it has been\r\nexposed is taken away, it throws out a pencil of flame so long that,\r\nwith this burning machine in my hand, I have taken above sixty steps in\r\nwalking about my room; when it is electrified strongly I can take it\r\ninto another room and there fire spirits of wine with it. If while it\r\nis electrifying I put my finger, or a piece of gold which I hold in my\r\nhand, to the nail, I receive a shock which stuns my arms and shoulders.”\r\n\r\nIt is said that Cunæus, rich burgess of Leyden, accidentally made\r\nthe same discovery in January 1746. It appears that Pieter Van\r\nMusschenbroek, the celebrated professor, while experimenting with his\r\ncolleagues, Cunæus and Allamand, observed that excited bodies soon\r\nlost their electricity in the open air, attributable to the vapours\r\nand effluvia carried in the atmosphere, and he conceived the idea that\r\nthe electricity might be retained by surrounding the excited bodies\r\nwith others that did not conduct electricity. For this purpose he\r\nchose water, the most readily procured non-electric, and placed some\r\nin a glass bottle. No important results were obtained until Cunæus,\r\nwho was holding the bottle, attempted to withdraw the wire which\r\nconnected with the conductor of a powerful electric machine. He at once\r\nreceived a severe shock in his arms and breast, as did also the others\r\nupon renewing the experiment. In giving an account of it to the great\r\nscientist, René de Réaumur, Musschenbroek remarked: “For the whole\r\nkingdom of France, I would not take a second shock.” Allamand states\r\nthat when he himself took the shock “he lost the use of his breath for\r\nsome minutes, and then felt so intense a pain along his right arm that\r\nhe feared permanent injury from it.”\r\n\r\nIn his “Cours Elémentaire de Physique,” Musschenbroek describes one\r\nof the peculiar electrical machines then being constructed by the\r\nwell-known London instrument maker, George Adams, and a cut of it can\r\nbe seen at p. 353, Vol. I. of the translation made by Sigaud de la\r\nFond at Paris during 1769. Another of Adams’ machines is described and\r\nillustrated at p. 126 of the French translation of Cavallo’s “Complete\r\nTreatise,” published at Paris in 1785.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the Leyden jar is claimed with equal pertinacity for\r\nKleist, Musschenbroek and Cunæus. While it is necessarily conceded\r\nthat Von Kleist first published his discovery, it cannot be denied\r\nthat his explanation of it is so obscure as, for the time, to have\r\nbeen of no practical use to others. It is stated by Priestley:\r\n“Notwithstanding Mr. Kleist immediately communicated an account of this\r\nfamous experiment (which indeed it is evident he has but imperfectly\r\ndescribed) to Mr. Winckler, at Leipzig, Mr. Swiettiki, of Denmark, Mr.\r\nKruger, of Halle, and to the professors of the Academy of Lignitz,\r\nas well as to Dr. Lieberkühn, of Berlin, above mentioned, they all\r\nreturned him word that the experiment did not succeed with them. Mr.\r\nGralath, of Dantzig, was the first with whom it answered; but this was\r\nnot till after several fruitless trials, and after receiving further\r\ninstructions from the inventor. The Abbé Nollet had information of\r\nthis discovery, and, in consequence of it says, in a letter to Mr.\r\nSamuel Wolfe, of the Society of Dantzig, dated March 9, 1746, that the\r\nexperiment at Leyden was upon principles similar to that made with\r\na phial half full of water and a nail dipped in it; and that this\r\ndiscovery would have been called the Dantzig experiment if it had not\r\nhappened to have got the name of that of Leyden.”\r\n\r\nIn the thirty-eighth volume of the _Philosophical Transactions_,\r\nNo. 432, p. 297, is given an abstract of a letter (dated Utrecht,\r\nJanuary 15, 1733, O. S.), from Petrus Van Musschenbroek, M.D., F.R.S.,\r\nto Dr. J. T. Desaguliers, concerning experiments made on the Indian\r\nMagnetic Sand, chiefly gathered along the seashore in Persia. After\r\ndetailing his many observations, Van Musschenbroek asks: “And, now,\r\nwhat can this _sand_ be? Is it an imperfect magnet, or Subtile\r\nPowder of it, which, when it is grown up into a greater lump, makes\r\nthe vulgar Loadstones? So I conjectured at first; but when I found by\r\nexperience that common Loadstones, exposed to the fire, according to\r\nsome of the methods above-mention’d, did rather lose of their force\r\nthan gain, I alter’d my opinion; and now confess that I have not yet\r\npenetrated into the knowledge of the nature of this matter.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Dalibard, “Histoire Abrégée,” p. 33; _Dantzig\r\n   Memoirs_, Vol. I. pp. 407, 409, 411; Johann Gottlob Kruger,\r\n   “Dissert. de Elect.,” Helmstadt, 1756 (Poggendorff, I. p. 1323);\r\n   Priestley, 1777, “The Hist. and Pres.

He says: “When the phial is well electrified,\r\nand you apply your hand thereto, you see the fire flash from the\r\noutside of the glass wherever you touch it, and it crackles in your\r\nhand.” It is to him that we owe the double coating of the jar, as well\r\nas the _plus_ and _minus_ of electricity.\r\n\r\nHe also shows conclusively that glass globes and tubes do not possess\r\nin themselves the electrical power, but only serve “as the first movers\r\nor determiners of that power,” and he also proves that the electric\r\nfluid takes the shortest course, passing through the substance of\r\nthe best medium of connection and not along its surface. This, he\r\ndemonstrated by discharging a phial through a wire covered with a\r\nmixture of wax and resin.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain the velocity of the electric fluid from the\r\nLeyden phial and the distance at which it could be transmitted (John\r\nWood, at A.D. 1726), Watson directed a series of experiments\r\nupon a very grand scale, with the assistance of Martin Folkes,\r\nPresident of the Royal Society, Lord Charles Cavendish, Dr. Bevis, Mr.\r\nGraham, Dr. Birch, Peter Daval and Messrs. Trembley, Ellicott, Robins\r\nand Short. On the 14th and 18th of July, 1747, they experimented upon\r\na wire carrying the electricity from the Thames bank at Lambeth to\r\nthe opposite bank at Westminster, across Westminster Bridge, and, on\r\nthe 24th of July, at the New River, Stoke Newington, they sent a shock\r\nthrough 800 feet of water and 2000 feet of land, as well as through\r\n2800 feet of land and 8000 feet of water. Other experiments followed\r\non the 28th of July and the 5th of August, as well as on the 14th of\r\nAugust of the same year, proving the instantaneous transmission of the\r\nfluid; while a year later, August 5, 1748, additional observations\r\nwere made, through 12,276 feet of wire, at Shooter’s Hill, showing\r\nagain that the time occupied in the passage of the electricity was\r\n“altogether inappreciable.” Regarding these experiments, Prof.\r\nMusschenbroek wrote to Dr. Watson, “_Magnificentissimis tuis\r\nexperimentis superasti conatus omnium_.”\r\n\r\nWatson’s experiments were repeated, notably by Franklin, across the\r\nSchuylkill at Philadelphia, in 1748; by Deluc, across the Lake of\r\nGeneva, in 1749; and by Winckler, at Leipzig, in 1750. It is said\r\nthat Lemonnier (A.D. 1746) produced shocks at Paris through\r\n12,789 feet of wire and that Bétancourt (A.D. 1795) discharged\r\nelectric jars through a distance of twenty-six miles.\r\n\r\nTo Dr. Watson is also due the first demonstration of the passage of\r\nelectricity through a vacuum. Noad tells us that he caused the spark\r\nfrom his conductor to pass in the form of coruscations of a bright\r\nsilver hue through an exhausted tube three feet in length, and he\r\ndischarged a jar through a vacuum interval of ten inches in the form\r\nof “a mass of very bright embodied fire.” These demonstrations were\r\nrepeated and varied by Canton, Smeaton and Wilson.\r\n\r\nHis experiments in firing gunpowder, hydrogen, etc., by the electric\r\nspark, are detailed at p. 78 of Priestley’s “History,” etc., London,\r\n1775.\r\n\r\nWatson was rewarded with the Copley medal for his researches in\r\nelectricity, which brought him also honorary degrees from two German\r\nuniversities. He was knighted in 1786, one year before his death.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Watson’s Experiments and Observations on\r\n   Electricity,” 1745, also his “Account of the Experiments made\r\n   by some gentlemen of the Royal Society,” etc., 1748; _Phil.\r\n   Trans._, Vol. XLIII. p. 481; Vol. XLIV. pp. 41, 388, 695,\r\n   704; Vol. XLV. pp. 49–120, 491–496; Vol. XLVI. p. 348; Vol.\r\n   XLVII. pp. 202, 236, 362, 567; Vol. XLVIII. p. 765; Vol. LI.\r\n   p. 394 (lyncurium of the ancients); Vol. LIII. p. 10; also the\r\n   following abridgments: Hutton, Vol. IX. pp. 151, 195, 308, 368,\r\n   408, 410, 440, 553; Vol. X. pp. 12, 189, 197, 227, 233, 242,\r\n   303, 372–379, 525; Vol. XI. p. 419 (lyncurium of the ancients),\r\n   580, 660, 679; Vol. XII. p. 127; John Martyn, Vol. X. part\r\n   ii. pp. 279–280, 290, 294, 329, 339, 347, 368, 407, 410.

Trans._, Vol.\r\nXLIV for 1746, p. 290; Snow Harris, “Treatise on Frict. Elect.,”\r\nLondon, 1867, p. 239, and “Hist. de l’Acad.,” 1746). He found that an\r\nanvil weighing two hundred pounds gives but an inconsiderable spark,\r\nwhile the spark from a tin speaking-trumpet eight or nine feet long,\r\nbut weighing only ten pounds, is almost equal to the shock of the\r\nLeyden phial. A solid ball of lead, four inches in diameter, gives a\r\nspark of the same force as that obtained from a thin piece of lead of\r\nlike superficies bent in the form of a hoop. He took a thin and long\r\npiece of lead, and noticed that when it was electrified in its whole\r\nlength it gave a very strong spark, but a very small one when it was\r\nrolled into a lump (_Ac. Par._, 1746, M. p. 369). It had likewise\r\nbeen shown by Le Roi and D’Arcy that a hollow sphere accepted the same\r\ncharge when empty as when filled with mercury, which latter increased\r\nits weight sixtyfold; all proving the influence of _surface_ as\r\ndistinguished from that of mass (Tyndall, Notes on Lecture IV).\r\n\r\nLemonnier discovered that electricity is ever present in the\r\natmosphere, that it daily increases in quantity from sunrise till about\r\nthree or four o’clock in the afternoon, diminishing till the fall of\r\ndew, when it once more increases for a while, and finally diminishes\r\nagain before midnight, when it becomes insensible. He observed a\r\ncontinual diminution of electricity as the rain began to fall, and he\r\nsays: “When the wire was surrounded with drops of rain, it was observed\r\nthat only some of them were electrical, which was remarkable by the\r\nconic figure they had; whilst the others remained round as before.\r\nIt was also perceived that the electrical and non-electrical drops\r\nsucceeded almost alternately; this made us call to mind a very singular\r\nphenomenon which happened some years before, to five peasants who were\r\npassing through a cornfield, near Frankfort upon the Oder, during a\r\nthunderstorm; when the lightning killed the first the third and the\r\nfifth of them, without injuring the second or the fourth” (_Phil.\r\nTrans._, Vol. XLVII. p. 550).\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Le Monnier, “Lois du Magnétisme,” Paris, 1776–1778;\r\n   _Phil.

As water only played the part of a conductor, he rightly\r\nthought that metal would do equally well, and he therefore filled\r\nthree jars with leaden shot instead of with water. When the metallic\r\nconnection was made it was found that the discharge from three jars was\r\ngreater than that from two and the discharge from two much greater than\r\nthat from one. This showed that the seat of the electric force is the\r\nsurface of the metal and the glass, and proves that the force of the\r\ncharge is in proportion to the quantity of coated surface.\r\n\r\nThus to Dr. Bevis belongs the credit of having constructed the first\r\nelectric battery, although the honour has been claimed by the friends\r\nof Daniel Gralath (A.D. 1747).\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Phil.

This result was confirmed by the\r\nAbbé Nollet, who filled two pots with vegetating seeds and found that\r\nthe pot which he had constantly electrified for fifteen consecutive\r\ndays put forth earlier sprouts as well as more numerous and longer\r\nshoots than did the other.\r\n\r\nLike experiments were at the same time carried on with equal success\r\nby M. Jallabert and M. Boze, as well as by the Abbé Menon, Principal\r\nof the College of Bueil at Angers, France. The last named also found\r\nthat electricity increases the insensible perspiration of animals.\r\nHe chose cats, pigeons and chaffinches, and observed after they were\r\nelectrified, that one cat was sixty-five or seventy grains lighter than\r\nthe other, the pigeon from thirty-five to thirty-eight grains, and the\r\nchaffinch had lost six or seven grains. He also electrified a young\r\nperson between the ages of twenty and thirty, for five hours and found\r\na loss in weight of several ounces.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the effect of electricity on different varieties of\r\ngrowing plants, a paper in Boston not long ago published the following:\r\n\r\n   “In the last few years some very interesting experiments in\r\n   gardening by electricity have been made by Prof. Selim Lemström,\r\n   of the University of Helsingfors. These have been carried out\r\n   both upon the potted plants in the hot-house and upon plants in\r\n   the open field, the insulated wires in the latter case being\r\n   stretched upon poles over the plot of ground, and provided\r\n   with a point for each square metre of area. The current has\r\n   been supplied by Holtz machines run from eight to eighteen\r\n   hours daily, the positive pole being connected with the network\r\n   of wires and the negative with a zinc plate buried in the\r\n   ground. The electric influence was scarcely perceptible in\r\n   the growing plants, but was very marked in the yield of many\r\n   species, especially of barley and wheat, of which the crop was\r\n   increased by half in some cases. In the hot-house the maturity\r\n   of strawberries was greatly advanced. The results have shown\r\n   that plants may be divided into two groups: one, the development\r\n   of which is favoured by electricity, comprising wheat, rye,\r\n   barley, oats, red and white beets, parsnips, potatoes,\r\n   celeriac, beans, raspberries, strawberries and leeks; and the\r\n   other, whose development is more or less interfered with by\r\n   electricity, including peas, carrots, kohlrabi, rutabagas,\r\n   turnips, white cabbages and tobacco. The more fertile the soil,\r\n   and consequently the more vigorous the vegetation, the greater\r\n   has been the excess of the crop under electric influence. Prof.\r\n   Lemström’s experiments up to 1887 were carried on in Finland,\r\n   but he has since repeated his work in France, and demonstrated\r\n   that the electric influence is the same in any climate, though\r\n   likely to be injurious under a scorching sun.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Nollet, “Recherches sur l’Electricité,” pp. 366,\r\n   382; _Phil.

The method, which he\r\nlong succeeded in keeping secret, was described after his death, in\r\nthe _Phil. Trans._ for 1746–1747, Vol. XLIV. It consists of placing\r\ntwo magnets in the same straight line, with their opposite poles close\r\nto or very near each other, and in laying under them the bar to be\r\nmagnetized after having it tempered at a cherry-red heat. The magnets\r\nare then drawn apart in opposite directions along the bar, so that the\r\nsouth pole of one magnet passes over the north polar half, and the\r\nnorth pole of the other magnet passes over the south polar half of the\r\nbar.\r\n\r\nThis was how Dr. Knight made the bars of the two great magnets of\r\nthe Royal Society. Each magnet contained two hundred and forty bars,\r\nfifteen inches long, one inch wide and half an inch thick. Dr. Robison\r\ndescribed, in 1800, the effect of pressing together the dissimilar\r\npoles of the two magnets, and, thirty years later, Prof. Faraday, upon\r\nplacing a soft iron cylinder, one foot long and three-quarters of an\r\ninch in diameter, across the dissimilar poles, found that he required a\r\nforce of one hundred pounds to break down the attractive power.\r\n\r\nPreviously to Dr. Knight’s discovery, the method of making artificial\r\nmagnets most in use was by simply rubbing the bar to be magnetized upon\r\none of the poles of a natural magnet in a plane at right angles to the\r\nline joining its two poles.\r\n\r\nAnother secret of Dr. Knight was also, after his death, made known to\r\nthe Royal Society by its secretary, Mr. Benjamin Wilson. It was the\r\nmode of making artificial paste magnets. He collected a large quantity\r\nof iron filings, which he cleansed and made into a fine powder under\r\nwater and afterward dried and mixed, preferably with linseed oil. This\r\nwas baked into cakes, which were magnetized by placing them between the\r\nends of his magazine of artificial magnets.\r\n\r\nTo Dr. Knight was given the first English patent in the Class of\r\nElectricity and Magnetism. It bears date June 10, 1766, No. 850, and is\r\nfor the construction of “Compasses so as to prevent them being affected\r\nby the motion of the ship,” etc.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Phil.

During the month of April 1746, he\r\ntransmitted, in the presence of the French King, an electrical shock\r\nfrom a small phial through a chain of one hundred and eighty of the\r\nRoyal Guards, and at the Carthusian Convent, not long afterward, he\r\nsent a shock through a line of monks stretched a distance of over a\r\nmile, causing them all to experience instantaneously the same sensation.\r\n\r\nNollet’s work, “Essai sur l’électricité des corps,” was originally\r\npublished at Paris in 1746. He was the first to observe that pointed\r\nbodies electrified give out streams of light (the smallest points\r\ndisplaying “brushes of electric light”), but that they do not exhibit\r\nas powerful indications of electricity as are shown by blunt bodies.\r\nHe also found that glass and other non-conductors are more strongly\r\nexcited in air than _in vacuo_; that the electric spark is more diffuse\r\nand unbroken _in vacuo_; and that an excited tube loses none of its\r\nelectricity by being placed in the focus of a concave mirror when the\r\nsunlight is therein concentrated.\r\n\r\nHis experiments upon the evaporation of fluids by electricity, as well\r\nas upon the electrification of capillary tubes full of water (observed\r\nalso by Boze), and upon the electrification of plants and animals, are\r\ndetailed in his “Recherches,” etc., pp. 327, 351, 354–356, while his\r\nobservations upon the electrical powers of different kinds of glass are\r\ngiven in the sixth volume of the “Leçons de Physique Expérimentale,”\r\nissued in 1764.\r\n\r\nAs has been truly said, it is no easy matter to form an adequate idea\r\nof Nollet’s theory of electricity, which was opposed at the time by\r\nalmost all the eminent electrical philosophers of Europe. He asserted\r\nthat when an electric is excited, electricity flows to it from all\r\nquarters, and when it is thus _affluent_, it drives light bodies before\r\nit. Hence the reason why excited bodies attract. When the electricity\r\nis _effluent_ the light bodies are of course driven from the electric,\r\nwhich in that condition appears to repel. He therefore believed every\r\nelectric to be possessed of two different kinds of pores, one for the\r\nemission of the electric matter, and the other for its reception.\r\n\r\nNollet is the first one who published the close relationship existing\r\nbetween lightning and the electric spark. This he did during the year\r\n1748, in the fourth volume of his “Leçons,” already alluded to and\r\nfrom which the following is extracted: “If any one should undertake to\r\nprove, as a clear consequence of the phenomenon, that thunder is in\r\nthe hands of nature what electricity is in ours--that those wonders\r\nwhich we dispose at our pleasure are only imitations on a small scale\r\nof those grand effects which terrify us, and that both depend on the\r\nsame mechanical agents ... I confess that this idea, well supported,\r\nwould please me much.... The universality of the electric matter,\r\nthe readiness of its actions, its instrumentality and its activity\r\nin giving fire to other bodies, its property of striking bodies,\r\nexternally and internally, even to their smallest parts ... begin to\r\nmake me believe that one might, by taking electricity for the model,\r\nform to one’s self, in regard to thunder and lightning, more perfect\r\nand more probable ideas than hitherto proposed.”\r\n\r\nFor a memoir treating of the cause of thunder and lightning, written\r\nby the Rev. Father de Lozeran de Fech, of Perpignan, the Bordeaux\r\nAcademy of Sciences had in 1726 awarded him its annual prize; and the\r\nsame institution conferred a similar award, in August 1750, upon M.\r\nBergeret, a physician of Dijon, whose memoir admitted the close analogy\r\nbetween lightning and electricity.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Ronalds’ “Catalogue,” pp. 369–371; Jean Morin,\r\n   “Réplique,” Paris, 1749; A.

To\r\nthis ether are ascribed the principal phenomena of attraction and\r\nrepulsion, whereas the light, the smell, and other sensible qualities\r\nof the electric fluid are referred to the grosser particles of bodies,\r\ndriven from them by the forcible action of this ether. Many phenomena\r\nin electricity are also attempted to be explained by means of a\r\nsubtile medium, at the surface of all bodies, which is the cause of\r\nthe refraction and reflection of the rays of light, and also resist\r\nthe entrance and exit of this ether. This medium, he says, extends to\r\na small distance from the body, and is of the same nature with what is\r\ncalled the electric fluid.[50] On the surface of conductors this medium\r\nis rare and easily admits the passage of the electric fluid, whereas\r\non the surface of electrics it is dense and resists it. This medium is\r\nrarefied by heat, which converts non-conductors into conductors.”\r\n\r\nAt pp. 71 and 88, 1746 edition, and at p. 88, Prop. XI. of the 1752\r\nedition of this same “Essay,” Wilson says that during the year 1746\r\nhe discovered a method of giving the shock of the Leyden jar to any\r\nparticular part of the body without affecting any other portion; that\r\nhe increased the shock from the jar by plunging it into water, thereby\r\ngiving it a coating of water on the outside as high as it was filled on\r\nthe inside; and that the accumulation of electricity in the Leyden jar\r\nis always in proportion to the thinness of the glass, the surface of\r\nthe glass and that of the non-electrics in contact with the inside and\r\noutside thereof.\r\n\r\nIt was in this same year, 1746, that Wilson first observed the _lateral\r\nshock_ or _return stroke_, which was not, however, explained until\r\nLord Mahon, third Earl of Stanhope, published his “Principles of\r\nElectricity,” in 1779.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of November, 1760, a paper of Mr. Wilson’s was read before\r\nthe Royal Society, in which he detailed several of his ingenious\r\nexperiments on the _plus_ and _minus_ of electricity, and showed\r\nthat these can be produced at pleasure by carefully attending to the\r\nform of bodies, their sudden or gradual removal and the degrees of\r\nelectrifying. He had previously noticed that when two electrics are\r\nrubbed together, the body whose substance is hardest and electric power\r\nstrongest is always electrified positively and the other negatively.\r\nRubbing the tourmaline and amber together he produced a _plus_\r\nelectricity on both sides of the stone and a _minus_ on the amber; but,\r\nrubbing the diamond and the tourmaline, both sides of the tourmaline\r\nwere electrified _minus_ and the diamond _plus_. When insulated silver\r\nand glass were rubbed, the silver became _minus_ and the glass _plus_.\r\n\r\nHe further observed that when directing a stream of air against a\r\ntourmaline, a pane of glass or a piece of amber, these were electrified\r\n_plus_ on both sides. Prof. Faraday subsequently showed that no\r\nelectrical effect is produced in these cases unless the air is either\r\ndamp or holds dry powders in suspension, the electricity being\r\nproduced by the friction of particles of water in the one case and\r\nby the particles of powder in the other. Sir David Brewster, who thus\r\nmentions the latter fact, likewise singles out two more of Mr. Wilson’s\r\nobservations, viz. that when a stick of sealing-wax is broken across or\r\nwhen a dry, warm piece of wood is rent asunder, one of the separated\r\nsurfaces becomes vitreously and the other resinously electrified.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--De La Rive, “Electricity,” Vol. I. p. 203; Wilson,\r\n   “Treatise on Electricity”; Wilson and Hoadley, “Observations\r\n   on a Series of Electrical Experiments”; _Phil.

This was the principle upon which Mr. Gralath constructed the\r\nelectrometer shown in _Dantzig Memoirs_, Vol. I. p. 525.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the experiments of Boze (A.D. 1738) and of Nollet\r\n(A.D. 1746) made with capillary tubes, he says that the siphon,\r\nthough electrified, will only deliver the water by drops if the\r\nbasin containing the water is also electrified. He explains Nollet’s\r\nobservation, that the electric matter issues more sensibly from the\r\npoint at the extremity of the conductor, by saying that the effluvia,\r\nin rushing from the globe along the conductor, as they approach the\r\npoint are brought nearer together, and therefore are denser there,\r\nand if the light be owing to the density and velocity of the effluvia\r\nit will be visible at the point and nowhere else. Ellicott’s theory\r\nof electricity is founded upon the following data: (1) electrical\r\nphenomena are produced by effluvia; (2) these effluvia repel each\r\nother; (3) they are attracted by all other matter. If the word\r\n_fluid_ is substituted for effluvia, these data absolutely agree with\r\nthose adopted by Æpinus and Cavendish, forming the basis of the only\r\nsatisfactory theory of electricity hitherto proposed.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Boulanger, “Traité de la Cause et des phénomènes de\r\n   l’électricité,” Paris, 1750, p. 324; _Phil.

Veratti,\r\nof Bologna, and by M. Bianchi, of Turin; also by Prof. Winckler, of\r\nLeipzig, who satisfied himself of the power of electricity on sulphur,\r\ncinnamon, and on balsam of Peru even at a distance.\r\n\r\nBy the above-named means of applying the electric fluid Pivati is\r\nreported to have effected cures of ordinary pains and aches, and to\r\nhave even relieved of gout the old Bishop Donadoni, of Sebenico, who\r\nhad long been a sufferer, and who was at the time seventy-five years\r\nof age. This pretended transudation and its medical effects could not,\r\nhowever, be verified, even with the directions asked of and given by\r\nProf. Winckler, when very careful and exhaustive experiments were made,\r\non the 12th of June, 1751, at the house of Dr. Watson, in presence\r\nof the president and other officers as well as friends of the Royal\r\nSociety.

William), M.D., is the first who\r\nadvanced that earthquakes are probably caused by electricity. This he\r\ndid in a paper read before the Royal Society, March 22, 1749, having\r\nreference to the subterranean disturbances noticed in London, February\r\n8 and March 8 of the same year. In this communication, as well as in a\r\nsubsequent one read to the same Society, December 6, 1750, bearing upon\r\na similar disturbance observed throughout England during the previous\r\nmonth of September, he explains why earthquakes are not the result of\r\nsubterraneous winds, fires, vapours, etc.\r\n\r\nOne of his strongest arguments is that no such vapours could\r\ninstantaneously have destroyed thirteen great cities as did the\r\nearthquake which occurred in Asia Minor, A.D. 17, and which is\r\nreckoned to have shaken a cone of earth three hundred miles diameter\r\nin base and two hundred miles in the axis. This quantity of earth, he\r\nsays, “all the gunpowder which has ever been made since the invention\r\nof it would not have been able to stir, much less any vapours, which\r\ncould be supposed to be generated so far below the surface,” and, he\r\nadds, “if the concussion depended upon a subterraneous eruption the\r\nshock would precede the noise.”\r\n\r\nHe observes that the earth for months prior to the afore-named\r\ndisturbances “must have been in a state of electricity ready for that\r\nparticular vibration in which electrification exists”; that all the\r\nvegetation had been “uncommonly forward ... and electricity is well\r\nknown to quicken vegetation”; that the aurora borealis had been very\r\nfrequent about the same time and had been twice repeated just before\r\nthe earthquake, “of such colours as had never been seen before,”\r\nthere being, one evening, “a deep red aurora borealis covering the\r\ncope of heaven very terrible to behold”; that the whole year had been\r\n“remarkable for fire-balls, thunder, lightning and coruscations, almost\r\nthroughout all England,” all which “are rightly judged to proceed from\r\nthe electrical state of the atmosphere”; and, finally, that, a little\r\nbefore the earthquake, “a large and black cloud suddenly covered the\r\natmosphere, which probably occasioned the shock by the discharge of\r\na shower.” He adds that, according to Dr. Childrey, earthquakes are\r\nalways preceded by rain and sudden tempests of rain in times of great\r\ndrought.\r\n\r\nDr. Stephen Hales (1677–1761), who was Stukeley’s classmate at Bennet\r\nCollege, Cambridge, and later his chief assistant in the study of\r\nthe natural sciences, and who afterward became celebrated for his\r\nphysical investigations and discoveries, arrives at a like conclusion.\r\nHe thinks that “the electric appearances were only occasioned by the\r\ngreat agitation which the electric fluid was put into by the shock\r\nof so great a mass of the earth.” The great noise which attended the\r\ndisturbance of March 8, 1749, he conjectured was “owing to the rushing\r\nor sudden expansion of the electric fluid at the top of St. Martin’s\r\nspire, where all the electric effluvia, which ascended along the large\r\nbody of the tower, being strongly condensed, and accelerated at the\r\npoint of the weathercock, as they rushed off made so much the louder\r\nexpansive explosion.” It may be added here that Dr. Hales is the\r\none who, at a previous date, had communicated to the Royal Society\r\nhis observation of the fact that the electric spark proceeding from\r\nwarm iron is of a bright, light colour, while that from warm copper\r\nis green, and the colour from a warm egg of a light yellow. In his\r\nopinion, these experiments appeared to argue that some particles of\r\nthose different bodies are carried off in the electric flashes wherein\r\nthose different colours are exhibited.\r\n\r\nFor Stephen Hales, consult the _Phil.

By\r\nmaking his Leyden experiments with a jar in which the water is frozen,\r\nhe shows that ice is a conductor of electricity. He improves upon\r\nNollet’s experiments, and demonstrates conclusively that plants which\r\nare electrified grow faster and have finer stems, etc., than those not\r\nelectrified. He is the first to observe that a body pointed at one\r\nend and round at the other produces different appearances upon the\r\nsame body, according as the pointed or the rounded end is presented to\r\nit. The _Dantzig Memoirs_, Vol. II. p. 378, tell us that Carolus\r\nAugustus Van Bergen, Professor of Medicine at Frankfort on Oder, had\r\npreviously noticed, “as a small step toward discovering the effect of\r\npointed bodies,” that sparks taken from a polished body are stronger\r\nthan those from a rough one. With the latter he found it difficult to\r\nfire spirits, but he could easily do it with a polished conductor.\r\n\r\nM. Jallabert is also known to have effected some medical cures through\r\nthe agency of the electric fluid, as related in the “Expériences” above\r\nalluded to.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Biog.

Antheaulme, the method introduced by Gowin Knight (A.D. 1746)\r\nfor making artificial magnets, which latter process was found to be\r\ndefective when applied to very large bars. To Le Maire, however, is due\r\n(_Mem. de l’Acad. de Paris_, 1745 and 1750), the notable improvement\r\nwhich consists in magnetizing at the same time two steel bars of any\r\nshape by placing them parallel to each other and connecting their\r\nextremities, with pieces of soft iron placed at right angles, in order\r\nto form a closed rectangular parallelogram. Two strong magnets, or two\r\nbunches of small magnetic bars, with their similar poles together, are\r\nthen applied to the centre of one of the bars to be magnetized and are\r\ndrawn away from each other, practically as in Dr. Knight’s method,\r\nwhile being held at an inclination of about forty-five degrees. The\r\noperation is repeated upon the other bar and continued alternately\r\nuntil sufficient magnetism is imparted to both, it being borne in mind\r\nthat before the treatment is given to the second bar the poles must in\r\neach instance be reversed, _i. e._ the pole which was to the right hand\r\nshould be turned to the left. The entire operation is to be repeated\r\nupon the reverse side of both bars.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Harris, “Rudim. Magn.,” I. and II. pp. 85 and 86;\r\n   P. Larousse, “Dict.

Trans._ In this he gives his observations of the result produced\r\non the magnetic needle by the aurora borealis.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen (under the A.D. 1683 date), that the discovery\r\nof the fact that magnets are affected by the polar lights has been\r\nascribed to Wargentin, and we have also learned (A.D. 1722) that he\r\nascertained the diurnal changes of the magnetic needle with more\r\nprecision than had been done by George Graham.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Walker, “Magnetism,” p. 116; _American Journal\r\n   Science and Arts_, 1841, Vol. XXX. p. 227; Celsius, A.D. 1740,\r\n   and the abridgments of Hutton, Vol. X. p. 165.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1750.=--Michell (John), an eminent English man of science,\r\nProfessor at Queens’ College, Cambridge, publishes “A treatise of\r\nArtificial Magnets, in which is shown an easy and expeditious method of\r\nmaking them superior to the best natural ones.”\r\n\r\nThe process introduced by this work is known as that of the “double\r\ntouch.” This consists in first joining, at about a quarter of an\r\ninch distance, two bundles of strongly magnetized bars, having their\r\nopposite poles together, and in drawing these bars backward and forward\r\nupon and along the entire length of the bars to be magnetized, which\r\nlatter have already been laid down end to end and in a straight line.\r\nThe operation is to be repeated upon each side of the bars. The central\r\nbars of a series thus acquire at first a higher degree of magnetism\r\nthan do the outer ones, but by transposing the latter and treating all\r\nalike the magnetic virtue is evenly distributed. In this process the\r\nexternal bars act the same part as do the pieces of soft iron employed\r\nin the Duhamel method.\r\n\r\nAt Chap. VI. p. 20 of the third volume of his “Rudimentary Magnetism,”\r\nHarris thus expresses himself: “Michell advanced the idea that in\r\nall the experiments of Hauksbee, Dr. Brooke Taylor, William Whiston\r\nand Musschenbroek, the force may really be in the inverse duplicate\r\nratio of the distances, proper allowance being made for the disturbing\r\nchanges in the magnetic forces so inseparable from the nature of the\r\nexperiment. He is hence led to conclude that the true law of the force\r\nis identical with that of gravity, although he does not set it down as\r\ncertain.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Harris, “Rud.

Sir John Leslie states that\r\nthe _silurus_ is furnished with a very peculiar and complex nervous\r\napparatus which has been fancifully likened to an electrical battery,\r\nand that, from a healthy specimen exhibited in London, vivid sparks\r\nwere drawn in a darkened room.

Royale des Sciences” for\r\n1782, p. 692.\r\n\r\nAdanson also called attention, in 1756, to the electrical powers of\r\nthe _malapterus electricus_, but, according to the able naturalist,\r\nJames Wilson (“Ichthyology,” _Encycl.

S.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1752.=--Franklin (Benjamin) (1706–1790), an able American\r\neditor, philosopher and statesman, crowns his many experiments with\r\nthe brilliant discovery of the identity of electricity and lightning.\r\nHumboldt says: “From this period the electric process passes from the\r\ndomain of speculative physics into that of cosmical contemplation--from\r\nthe recesses of the study to the freedom of nature” (“Cosmos,” Vol. II.\r\n1849, p. 727). Wall (A.D. 1708) had only alluded to the resemblance of\r\nelectricity to thunder and lightning; Grey (A.D. 1720) had conjectured\r\ntheir identity and implied that they differed only in one degree, while\r\nNollet (A.D. 1746) pointed out a closer relationship than ever before\r\nadduced between lightning and the electric spark; but it was left for\r\nFranklin to prove the fact with empirical certainty.\r\n\r\nFranklin’s attention was first directed to electrical studies in 1745,\r\nby a letter from Peter Collinson, Fellow of the Royal Society of\r\nLondon, to the Literary Society of Philadelphia, and he first wrote\r\non the subject to that gentleman on the 28th of July, 1747. This was\r\nfollowed by several other similar communications up to April 18, 1754,\r\nthe whole of which comprise most of what subsequently appeared under\r\nthe title “New Experiments and Observations on Electricity, made at\r\nPhiladelphia, in America, by Benjamin Franklin, LL.D. and F.R.S.”\r\n\r\nFranklin first entertained the idea that lightning was not likely to\r\nbe attracted by a pointed rod unless the latter was placed at a great\r\nheight, and he therefore waited for the erection of a tall spire in\r\nPhiladelphia which he intended to utilize for his observations, but\r\ndelay in its completion led him to use a kite pointed with an iron rod,\r\nnot doubting that the electric fluid could, during a thunderstorm, be\r\ndrawn from it through a string.\r\n\r\nThe manner of constructing and employing the kite, and the attending\r\nresults, are thus given in a letter dated Oct. 19, 1752 (Letter XII,\r\n“Experiments and observations on Electricity”): “Make a small cross\r\nof two light strips of cedar, the arms so long as to reach to the\r\nfour corners of a large thin silk handkerchief when extended. Tie the\r\ncorners of the handkerchief to the extremities of the cross, so you\r\nhave the body of a kite which, being properly accommodated with a\r\ntail, loop and string, will rise in the air like those made of paper;\r\nbut, this being made of silk, is fitter to bear the wet and wind of a\r\nthunder-gust without tearing. To the top of the upright stick of the\r\ncross is to be fixed a very sharp-pointed wire, rising a foot or more\r\nabove the wood. In the end of the twine, next the hand, is to be held a\r\nsilk ribbon, and where the silk and twine join a key may be fastened.\r\nThis kite is to be raised when a thunder-gust appears to be coming on,\r\nand the person who holds the string must stand within a door or window,\r\nor under some cover, so that the silk ribbon may not be wet, and care\r\nmust be taken that the twine does not touch the frame of the door or\r\nwindow. As soon as any of the thunder clouds come over the kite, the\r\npointed wire will draw the electric fire from them, and the kite with\r\nall the twine will be electrified, and the lose filaments of the twine\r\nwill stand out every way and be attracted by an approaching finger. And\r\nwhen the rain has wetted the kite so that it can conduct the electric\r\nfire freely, you will find it stream out plentifully from the key on\r\nthe approach of your knuckle. At this key, the phial (Leyden jar)\r\nmay be charged, and from electric fire thus obtained spirits may be\r\nkindled, and all the other electric experiments be performed which are\r\nusually done by the help of a rubber glass globe or tube, and thereby\r\nthe sameness of the electric matter with that of lightning completely\r\ndemonstrated.”\r\n\r\nIt was during the month of June 1752, on the approach of a storm, that\r\nhe and his son walked out upon the Philadelphia Commons and first\r\nraised the kite. At the outset no important results were obtained,\r\nbut as soon as the cord became wet by the shower that followed, the\r\nelectric sparks were easily drawn from the key and enabled Franklin to\r\ncharge and give shocks from a Leyden jar.\r\n\r\nThus, says Sabine, was Benjamin Franklin successful in one of the\r\nboldest experiments ever made by man upon the powers of nature, and\r\nfrom that moment he became immortal.\r\n\r\nHe had already, in 1749, made public the following, which is\r\nembodied in one of his letters to Mr. Collinson: “The electrical\r\nspark is zigzag, and not straight; so is lightning. Pointed bodies\r\nattract electricity; lightning strikes mountains, trees, spires,\r\nmasts and chimneys. When different paths are offered to the escape\r\nof electricity, it chooses the best conductor; so does lightning.\r\nElectricity fires combustibles; so does lightning. Electricity fuses\r\nmetals; so does lightning. Lightning rends bad conductors when it\r\nstrikes them; so does electricity when rendered sufficiently strong.\r\nLightning reverses the poles of a magnet; electricity has the same\r\neffect.”\r\n\r\nFranklin had, likewise, published at about the same period the plan\r\nfor an experiment to ascertain from elevated structures whether the\r\nclouds that contain lightning are electrified or not. He himself had\r\nproposed to put the plan to execution; but he was led to try the kite\r\nexperiment, and, meanwhile, his suggestions had been successfully acted\r\nupon, in France, by M. Dalibard and de Lor, as will be shown later on.\r\n\r\n   “The lightning, which doth cease to be, ere one can say, ‘it\r\n   lightens.’”--Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n   “First let me talk with this philosopher; what is the cause of\r\n   thunder?”--Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n   “... a way for the lightning of the thunder.”--Job xxviii. 26,\r\n   and xxxviii. 25.\r\n\r\n   “It related not to the instances of the _magneticalness_ of\r\n   lightning.”--“Hist. of Roy. Soc.,” by Thomas Birch, Vol. IV. p.\r\n   253.\r\n\r\nWhen specifying the great points of coincidence existing between the\r\nordinary electric discharge and lightning, Franklin, as already partly\r\nstated, had remarked that flashes of lightning are frequently waving\r\nand crooked, of a zigzag or forked appearance, sometimes diffused\r\nand sometimes coloured (“On the Nature of Thunderstorms,” W. Snow\r\nHarris, London, 1843, p. 24; Priestley, “History and Present State\r\nof Electricity,” London, 1769, p. 166; “Encycl. Metropol.,” article\r\n“Electricity”; Biot, “Traité de Physique,” Vol. II). In treating of\r\nthe subject of lightning flashes, Dr. L. D. Gale (trans. of M. F. J.\r\nF. Duprez’s paper on “Atmospheric Electricity,” taken from the memoirs\r\nof the Royal Academy of Brussels) alludes to the attempts made by C.\r\nG. Helvig to determine the velocity of the linear flashes (Gilbert’s\r\n_Annalen_, Vol. LI. pp. 136 and 139, ss. 2, 10) which he estimated to\r\nbe 40,000 to 50,000 feet in a second, and states that M. Weigsenborn,\r\nof Weimar (_Comptes Rendus_, Vol. IX. p. 218), calculated the velocity\r\nof a flash observed in 1839 to be more than two leagues, while M.\r\nFrançois Arago (“Annuaire,” etc., pour l’année 1838, pp. 249, 255,\r\n257, 459, estimated the lengths of certain flashes to be 3·3, 3·6,\r\n3·8 leagues.

Brandes (“Beiträge zur Witterungskunde,”\r\netc., 1820, p. 353), C. H. Pfaff and L. E. Kaemtz (J. S. T. Gehler,\r\n“Dict. de Phys.,” Vol. I. p. 1001, and “Lehrbuch d.

T.\r\nGehler, “Dict. de Phys.,” Vol. I. p. 999), are also set forth in the\r\nabove-named translation of M. Duprez’s valuable work.\r\n\r\nHumboldt informs us that “the most important ancient notice of\r\nthe relations between lightning and conducting metals is that of\r\nCtesias, in his _Indica_, Cap. IV. p. 169. He possessed two iron\r\nswords, presents from the King Artaxerxes Mnemon, and from his mother\r\nParysatis, which, when planted in the earth, averted clouds, hail and\r\n_strokes of lightning_. He had himself seen the operation, for the king\r\nhad twice made the experiment before his eyes” (“Cosmos,” Vol. II. N.\r\n186). Ctesias was a man of great learning. He was a contemporary of\r\nXenophon, and lived for a number of years at the Court of Artaxerxes\r\nMnemon as private physician to the king. Diodorus states that Ctesias\r\nwas highly honoured at the Persian court. An abridged edition of the\r\n_Indica_ was printed by Stephens in 1594 (“Hist. Roy. Soc.,” C. R.\r\nWeld, London, 1848, Vol. II. p. 93; “La Grande Encyclopédie,” Vol.\r\nXIII. p. 536; “Biographie Générale,” Vol. XII. p. 568).\r\n\r\nIn imitation of Franklin, Doctor Lining, of Charleston, in South\r\nCarolina, sent a kite into a thunder cloud, and by that means\r\ndissipated the lightning (_Philosophical Transactions_ for 1754, Vol.\r\nXLVIII. p. 757).\r\n\r\nThe opinion entertained by Franklin regarding the nature of electricity\r\ndiffers from that previously submitted by Dufay (A.D. 1733),\r\nin the manner shown by Noad at p. 6 of his Manual, London, 1859 edition.\r\n\r\nWhat Dufay considered to be two distinct species of electricities,\r\n_vitreous_ and _resinous_, Franklin conceived to be two different\r\nstates of the same electricity, which he called _positive_ and\r\n_negative_. This, which constitutes the foundation of the present\r\ntheory of electricity, is usually called the Franklinian theory, but it\r\ncan be said to belong equally to Dr. Watson, for he had communicated it\r\nto the Royal Society before Franklin’s opinion on the subject was known\r\nin England (_Phil. Trans._ for 1748, Vol. XLV. pp. 49, 491; Thomson,\r\n“Hist. Roy. Soc.,” p. 436). Noad, in paragraph 12, applies the latter\r\ntheory to the case of a charged Leyden jar, alluding to Franklin’s\r\ndiscovery of the location of electricity in the jar, wherefrom is\r\ndrawn the conclusion that it is upon the glass that the electricity\r\nis deposited, and that the conducting coatings serve “only, like the\r\narmature of the loadstone, to unite the forces of the several parts and\r\nbring them at once to any point desired” (see “Œuvres de Franklin,”\r\ntrans. of Barbeu-Dubourg, Tome II. p. 16, 3^e lettre).\r\n\r\nOf his _plus_ and _minus_ theory, Franklin thus wrote to Mr. Collinson:\r\n“To electrise _plus_ or _minus_ no more needs to be known than this,\r\nthat the parts of the tube or sphere that are rubbed do, in the\r\ninstant of the friction, attract the electrical fire, and therefore\r\ntake it from the thing rubbing; the same parts, immediately as the\r\nfriction upon them ceases, are disposed to give the fire they have\r\nreceived to any body that has less.”\r\n\r\nIn an appendix to his official report as U.S. Commissioner at the\r\nParis Universal Exposition of 1867, entitled “Franklin and Electrical\r\nSemaphores,” Professor Samuel F. B. Morse, LL.D., expressed himself as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“It has frequently been asserted (on what authority I know not) that\r\nthe first idea of an electric semaphore originated with Franklin. I\r\nhave sought in vain in the publication of Franklin’s experiments and\r\nworks for anything confirmatory of this assertion. On mentioning the\r\nsubject to my friend Professor Blake, he kindly proposed examining the\r\nwritings of Franklin in order to elicit the truth. From him I have\r\nreceived the following:\r\n\r\n“‘I consulted several works for the purpose of ascertaining, if\r\npossible, the foundation for the statement that Franklin suggested the\r\nidea of semaphores by static electricity. I have not yet found any\r\nsuch suggestion, but I have noted that, following the experiments by\r\nDr. Watson and others, in England, to determine the _velocity_ of\r\nthe electric discharge, and the time supposed to be required for the\r\nelectrical discharges across the Thames, by which spirits were kindled,\r\netc. (in 1747), Dr. Franklin (in 1748) made some similar experiments\r\nupon the banks of the Schuylkill, and amused his friends by sending a\r\nspark “from side to side through the river without any other conductor\r\nthan the water” (vide Priestley’s “History of Electricity”). This was\r\nin 1748, at the end of the year. In 1756 “J. A., Esq.,” of New York\r\n(James Alexander), presented to the Royal Society a proposition “to\r\nmeasure the time taken by an electric spark in moving through any\r\ngiven space” by sending the discharge or spark down the Susquehanna or\r\nPotomac, and round by way of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, so that\r\nthe “electric fire” would have a circuit of some thousands of miles to\r\ngo. All this was upon the supposition or assumption that the electric\r\nfire would choose a continuous water conductor rather than to return\r\nor pass through the earth. Franklin presented a paper in reply, in\r\nwhich he says “the proposed experiment (though well imagined and very\r\ningenious) of sending the spark round through a vast length of space,\r\netc. etc., would not afford the satisfaction desired, though we could\r\nbe sure that the motion of the electric fluid would be in that tract,\r\nand not underground in the wet earth by the shortest way”’ (‘Franklin’s\r\nExperiments on Electricity, and Letters and Papers on Philosophical\r\nSubjects,’ 4to, London, MDCCLXIX, pp. 282, 283).\r\n\r\n“Can it be possible that Franklin’s experiment of firing spirits and\r\nshowing the spark and the effects of the electric discharge across the\r\nriver originated, or forms the foundation for, the statement that he\r\nsuggested the semaphoric use of electricity?”\r\n\r\nAfter speaking of the experiments, to which allusion was made (at\r\nWatson, A.D. 1745), Franklin writes: “... It is proposed to\r\nput an end to them for this season, somewhat humorously, in a party of\r\npleasure, on the banks of the Schuylkill. Spirits at the same time are\r\nto be fired by a spark sent from side to side through the river without\r\nany other conductor than the water--an experiment which we some time\r\nsince performed to the amazement of many. A turkey is to be killed for\r\nour dinner by the electrical shock, and roasted by the electrical jack,\r\nbefore a fire kindled by the electrified bottle, when the healths of\r\nall the famous electricians in England, Holland, France and Germany are\r\nto be drank in electrified bumpers under the discharge of guns from the\r\nelectrical battery.”\r\n\r\nIt was toward the close of the year 1750 that Franklin entertained the\r\npracticability of a lightning conductor (see Winckler, A.D.\r\n1733), and, for this, he says, he was indebted to an experiment made\r\nby his friend Mr. Thomas Hopkinson (vide Franklin’s “Complete Works,”\r\nLondon, 1806, Vol. I. p. 172). In his “Poor Richard’s Almanac” for\r\n1753, he refers to the lightning rod as security for “habitations and\r\nother buildings from mischief by thunder and lightning.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--J. B.

He says that he sent a charge of electricity\r\n“through a small glass tube that had borne it well when empty, but when\r\nfilled with water was shattered to pieces and driven all about the\r\nroom. Finding no part of the water on the table, I suspected it to have\r\nbeen reduced to vapour. I was confirmed in that suspicion afterward\r\nwhen I had filled a like piece of tube with ink and laid it on a sheet\r\nof paper, whereon after the explosion I could find neither any moisture\r\nnor any sully from the ink. This experiment of the explosion of water,\r\nwhich I believe was first made by that most ingenious electrician,\r\nFather Beccaria, may account for what we sometimes see in a tree struck\r\nby lightning, when part of it is reduced to fine splinters like a\r\nbroom; the sap vessels being so many tubes containing a watery fluid,\r\nwhich, when reduced to vapour, sends every tube lengthways. And,\r\nperhaps it is this rarefaction of the fluids in animal bodies killed\r\nby lightning or electricity, that by separating its fibres renders\r\nthe flesh so tender and apt so much sooner to putrefy. I think, too,\r\nthat much of the damage done by lightning to stone and brick walls may\r\nsometimes be owing to the explosion of water found during showers,\r\nrunning or lodging in the joints or small cavities or cracks that\r\nhappen to be in the walls.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Majus--May--(Heinrich), “Disp. de fulmine” and\r\n   “Disp. de tonitru,” Marp., 1673, as at Pogg., _Annalen_, Vol.\r\n   II. p. 21; Giuseppe Saverio Poli, “La formazione del Tuono,”\r\n   etc., 1772, and his other works on the same subject which\r\n   appeared during the years 1773, 1779 and 1787; _Phil.

Dalibard’s apparatus consisted of a pointed iron rod,\r\none inch in diameter and about forty feet long, which was protected\r\nfrom the rain by a sentry box and attached to three long wooden posts\r\ninsulated by silken strings.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of May, 1752, during Dalibard’s absence, an old soldier\r\nby the name of Coiffier, who was at the time employed as a carpenter\r\nand who had been left in charge, on observing the approach of a storm,\r\nhurried to the apparatus prepared to carry out the instructions\r\npreviously given him. It was not long before he succeeded in obtaining\r\nlarge sparks on presenting a phial to the rod, and these sparks, which\r\nwere all accompanied by a large snapping noise, were likewise obtained\r\nby the curate of Marly, M. Raulet, whom he had sent for and with whose\r\naid Coiffier subsequently succeeded in charging an electric jar. On the\r\n13th of May, Dalibard made, to the French Academy of Sciences, a report\r\nof the results thus obtained by Coiffier, to whom, it may be said,\r\nproperly belongs the distinction of having been _the first man who\r\nsaw the electric spark drawn from the atmosphere_.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of the same month of May, M. de Lor, of the French\r\nUniversity, drew similar sparks from a rod ninety-nine feet high at\r\nhis house in the Estrapade, at Paris, and the same phenomenon was\r\nafterward exhibited to the French King. It is said that the conductor\r\nafforded sparks even when the cloud had moved at least six miles from\r\nthe place of observation. Other experiments of a like nature were made\r\na few days later by Buffon at Montbar, and, during the ensuing months\r\nof July and August, in the vicinity of London, by Canton, who, it is\r\nsaid, succeeded in drawing atmospheric electricity by means of a common\r\nfishing rod (Dissertation Fifth, Eighth “Britannica,” Vol. I).\r\n\r\nAn account of the Dalibard and de Lor experiments was transmitted by\r\nthe Abbé Mazéas, on the 20th of May, to the Royal Society of London.\r\n\r\nMazéas erected, in the upper section of his residence, a magazine\r\nconsisting of several insulated iron bars connected with the pointed\r\nrod. The lightning was brought into the house by means of a projecting\r\nwooden pole, having at its extremity a glass tube filled with resin\r\nwhich received a pointed iron rod twelve feet long. This apparatus was,\r\nhowever, too much exposed to afford reliable observations, and Mazéas\r\ntherefore arranged to make more accurate experiments at the Château\r\nde Maintenon, during the months of June, July and October 1753. The\r\nresults he obtained were communicated to the English Royal Society by\r\nDr. Stephen Hales. The letters of the Abbé Mazéas to the Rev. Stephen\r\nHales, detailing some of M. Le Monnier’s experiments as well as\r\nobservations made by M. Ludolf at Berlin and transmitted by M. Euler,\r\nare to be found at pp. 354–552, Vol. XLVII. _Phil. Trans._ for 1753.\r\nFor Mazéas, see also _Phil. Trans._, Vol. XLVII. p. 534, Vol. XLVIII.\r\npart i. p. 377, and Hutton’s abridgments, Vol. X. pp. 289, 434.\r\n\r\nThomas Ronayne in Ireland, and Andrew Crosse[51] in England (see\r\n“Account of an apparatus for ascertaining and collecting the\r\nelectricity of the atmosphere”) made use of long wires in horizontal\r\npositions insulated by being attached to glass pillars, but Mazéas, in\r\nhis Maintenon experiments, attached the iron wire by a silken cord to\r\nthe top of a steeple ninety feet in height, whence it entered an upper\r\nroom of the castle, a total distance of 370 feet. With this, Mazéas\r\nascertained that electric effects are produced at all hours of the\r\nday during clear, dry and particularly hot weather, the presence of\r\na thunderstorm not being requisite for the production of atmospheric\r\nelectricity. In the driest summer nights he could discover no signs of\r\nelectricity in the air, but when the sun reappeared the electricity\r\naccompanied it, to vanish again in the evening about half an hour after\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--W.

Perhaps the word _Vivacity_ might not have been an improper\r\none; but it is too late to think of changing a name it has so long\r\nobtain’d.” In the Third Part, he explains that “by the Fire passing\r\nfrom and to the Sun, it so pervades iron aptly placed, as to make it\r\nattractive and produce the various operations of magnetism.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCE.--“Gentleman’s Magazine,” London, Vol. XVI for 1746,\r\n   pp. 521, 557.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1752.=--In this year was published at Leipzig the “Biblia\r\nNaturæ,” written by John Swammerdam, a celebrated Dutch natural\r\nphilosopher (1637–1682), all of whose works were translated into\r\nEnglish and published in folio during the year 1758.\r\n\r\nIn the second volume of the _Biblia_, he thus alludes to one of many\r\nexperiments made by him in 1678, before the Grand Duke of Tuscany: “Let\r\nthere be a cylindrical glass tube in the interior of which is placed a\r\nmuscle, whence proceeds a nerve that has been enveloped in its course\r\nwith a small silver wire, so as to give us the power of raising it\r\nwithout pressing it too much or wounding it. This wire is made to pass\r\nthrough a ring bored in the extremity of a small copper support and\r\nsoldered to a sort of piston or partition; but the little silver wire\r\nis so arranged that on passing between the glass and the piston the\r\nnerve may be drawn by the hand and so touch the copper. The muscle is\r\nimmediately seen to contract.”\r\n\r\nThrough Swammerdam, the Germans lay claim to the origin of what\r\nhas been called galvanism.

This account, fully\r\nillustrated, appears in the Society’s Vol. LXVII for the years 1751 and\r\n1752, pp. 415–428.\r\n\r\nHe observes that, upon heating the middle of a large iron bar to\r\na great heat, the hot part can be as strongly electrified as the\r\ncold parts on each side of it. He also finds that if anybody who is\r\ninsulated presses the flat part of his hand heavily against the globe,\r\nwhile another person standing upon the floor does the same, in order to\r\nexcite it, the one who is insulated will hardly be electrified at all;\r\nbut that, if he only lays his fingers lightly upon the globe, he will\r\nbe very strongly electrified.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Wilson, “Treatise on Electricity,” pp. 129–216;\r\n   _Phil.

Sparks two inches in length were at\r\nfirst drawn by a discharging rod, and, when the kite was afterwards\r\nallowed to reach an elevation of six hundred and fifty feet, he\r\nreceived many flashes one foot long, three inches wide and three lines\r\ndiameter, accompanied by a noise audible at as great a distance as five\r\nhundred feet.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of August, M. de Romas raised the kite with about one\r\nthousand feet of string and obtained thirty beams of fire, nine or ten\r\nfeet long and about an inch thick, accompanied by a noise similar to\r\nthat of a pistol shot (“Encycl. Britannica,” eighth edition, Vol. VIII.\r\np. 582). Three years later, August 26, 1756, and also during the year\r\n1757, De Romas obtained similar results from numerous experiments.\r\nHe finally apprehended much danger from the raising of the kite and\r\nthereafter coiled the string upon a small carriage, which he drew along\r\nby means of silken lines as the cord was being unwound.\r\n\r\nThe researches of De Romas concerning the electricity of isolated\r\nmetallic bars are embraced in six letters addressed by him to the\r\nBordeaux Academy of Sciences between July 12, 1752, and June 14, 1753.\r\nIt is reported that they have never been printed and that they are\r\nkept, together with other manuscript matter of the same physicist, in\r\nthe private archives of the institution.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of De Romas upon isolated bars were first repeated by\r\nBoze at Wittenberg, by Gordon at Erfurt, and by Lomonozow in Russia\r\n(_Phil.

He hastened away\r\nin company with his engraver, M. Sokolow, and upon their arrival home\r\nthey found the plummet of the electrometer elevated four degrees from\r\nthe perpendicular. Richmann stooped toward the latter to ascertain the\r\nforce of the electricity, and “as he stood in that posture, a great\r\nwhite and bluish fire appeared between the rod of the electrometer\r\nand his head.

This he proves on taking a\r\ntube, which had been roughened by grinding it with thin sheet-lead\r\nand flour-of-emery mixed with water, and which developed vitreous\r\nelectricity when rubbed with dry oil silk, and resinous or negative\r\nelectricity when rubbed with new flannel. Rough quartz will, it is\r\nsaid, show like results. He also took a tube, of which only one-half\r\nhad been made rough while the other half was polished, and he\r\ndemonstrated that the different electricities are produced at a single\r\nstroke with the same rubber.\r\n\r\nHe likewise discovered that the exciting power of the rubber or cushion\r\nof the electrical machine will be very greatly increased by applying to\r\nit an amalgam of mercury and tin mixed with a little chalk or whiting\r\n(see Winckler, at A.D. 1733, for the introduction of the\r\ncushion).\r\n\r\nHis very remarkable experiments upon many descriptions of tourmaline,\r\nreported to the Royal Society in December 1759, were followed by\r\nmany others detailed by Priestley, at pp. 298–301 of his “History of\r\nElectricity,” London, 1775, and Canton was the first to discover the\r\nelectrical properties of the topaz, which latter were made known during\r\nthe early part of the year 1760. (Consult Wilhelm Hankel, “Uber die\r\ntherm. eigen. des Topases,” Leipzig, 1870.)\r\n\r\nHe was also the first to establish properly the fundamental fact of\r\nelectrification by induction, or, as he terms it, “relating to bodies\r\nimmerged in electric atmospheres,” which afterward led Wilcke (A.D.\r\n1757) and Æpinus (A.D. 1759) to the method of charging a plate of\r\nair like a plate of glass, and to make the most perfect imitation\r\nof the phenomena of thunder and lightning (George Adams, “Essay on\r\nElectricity,” London, 1799, pp. 351–356; Noad, “Manual,” Chapter I,\r\nand Priestley, “History,” etc., s. 5).

The principle enounced is that “the electric fluid, when there\r\nis a redundancy of it in any body, repels the electric fluid in any\r\nother body when they are brought within the sphere of each other’s\r\ninfluence and drives it into the remote parts of the body; or quite\r\nout of it, if there be any outlet for that purpose. In other words,\r\nbodies immerged in electric atmospheres always become possessed of the\r\nelectricity contrary to that of the body in whose atmosphere they are\r\nimmerged.”\r\n\r\nCanton is the first to show that the air of a room can be electrified\r\neither positively or negatively, and can be made to retain the\r\nelectricity when received. He thus explains his method: “Take a charged\r\nphial in one hand and a lighted candle insulated in the other, and,\r\ngoing into any room, bring the wire of the phial very near to the\r\nflame of the candle and hold it there about half a minute, then carry\r\nthe phial and candle out of the room and return with the pith balls\r\n(suspended by fine linen threads) held out at arm’s length. The balls\r\nwill begin to separate on entering the room and will stand an inch and\r\na half or two inches apart when brought near the middle of it.”\r\n\r\nThe construction of artificial magnets by Canton, through the\r\ncombination of the Duhamel (A.D. 1749) and the Michell (A.D. 1750)\r\nmethods, as well as without the aid of natural loadstones or artificial\r\nmagnets, is detailed by Noad at Chapter XV of his “Manual,” London,\r\n1859.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Phil.

He was the first who recorded the phenomena\r\nof thunderstorms, and his many observations thereon are detailed\r\nthroughout Part I. period x. and s. 10 of Priestley’s great work on\r\nelectricity. Beccaria says that all clouds, whether of thunder, rain,\r\nsnow or hail, are formed by the electric fluid; that the electric\r\nmatter is continually darting from the clouds in one place at the\r\nsame time that it is discharged from the earth in another; and that\r\nthe clouds serve as conductors to convey the electric fluid from those\r\nplaces of the earth which are overloaded with it to those which are\r\nexhausted of it. Having shown that the polarity of the magnetic needle\r\nis determined by the direction in which the electric current has passed\r\nthrough it, he suggests taking the polarity acquired by ferruginous\r\nbodies as a test for ascertaining the kind of electricity with which\r\nthe thunder cloud is charged.\r\n\r\nHe also shows that the meteor called a _falling star_ is an electrical\r\nappearance, explains the cause of the peculiar noise attending the\r\nelectric spark, and states that the passage of electricity is not\r\ninstantaneous through the best conductors. He found a spark to occupy\r\nat least half a second in passing through 500 feet of wire, and six and\r\na half seconds through a hempen cord of the same length, although when\r\nthe cord was dampened it passed through it in two or three seconds.\r\n\r\nHe was the first to show the electric spark while in its passage\r\nthrough water, and he observed that the water sank in the tubes\r\nwhenever a spark passed from one to the other as the air was repelled\r\nby the electric fluid. He found the effect of the electric spark upon\r\nwater greater than the effect of common fire on gunpowder, and says\r\nhe does not doubt that, if a method could be found of managing them\r\nequally well, a cannon charged with water would be more effective\r\n(“dreadful”) than one charged with gunpowder.\r\n\r\nHe demonstrates that air, contiguous to an electrified body, gradually\r\nacquires the same electricity; that the electricity of the body is\r\ndiminished by that of the air; that there is mutual repulsion between\r\nair and the electric fluid, and that the latter, in passing through any\r\nportion of air, creates a temporary vacuum.\r\n\r\nThe production of what he calls his _new inventive phosphorus_ and\r\nthe method he employs for _revivifying metals_, are described,\r\nrespectively, at pp. 365 and 282 of his “Lettere dell’ elettricismo.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Beccaria, “Lettere,” etc., Bologna, 1758, pp. 146,\r\n   etc., 193, 266, 268, 290, 310, 345; likewise his “Elettricismo\r\n   Artificiale,” Turin, 1753, pp. 110, 114, 227; _Phil.

The\r\napparatus was composed of a pole surmounted by an iron rod supporting\r\ntwelve curved up branches and terminating in the same number of\r\nmetallic boxes filled with iron ore and closed by a boxwood cover\r\ntraversed by twenty-seven sharp iron points which plunged at their base\r\nin the ore. All the system of wires was united to the earth by a large\r\nchain. The enemies of Diwish, jealous of his success at the court of\r\nVienna, excited the peasants of the locality against him, and, under\r\nthe pretext that his lightning rod was the cause of the great drought,\r\nthey made him take down the lightning rod which he had utilized for\r\nsix years and then imprisoned him.

He says that the electric fluid\r\nexplains the sympathy known to exist between amber and straws--shown by\r\nthe analogy observed between electricity and magnetism to be the same\r\nas that existing between iron and the loadstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1754.=--Mr. Strype produces the sixth and last edition of\r\nthe original “Survey of London” by John Stow, which first appeared\r\nduring the year 1598.\r\n\r\nIn his account of Cornehill Ward, allusion is made to the “fair new\r\nsteeple” of the Church of Saint Michael th’ Archangel, “begun to be\r\nbuilt in the year 1421,” and, at p. 74, occurs the following: “As I\r\nhave oft heard my father report, upon St. James’ night, certain men\r\nin the loft next under the bells, ringing of a peal, a tempest of\r\nlightning and thunder did arise, an ugly shapen sight appeared to\r\nthem, coming in at the South window and lighted on the North, for fear\r\nwhereof they all fell down and lay as dead for the time, letting the\r\nbells ring and cease of their own accord; when the ringers came to\r\nthemselves, they found certain stones of the North window to be razed\r\nand scratched, as if they had been so much butter, printed with a\r\nlion’s claw; the same stones were fastened there again and so remain to\r\nthis day.”\r\n\r\nIn one of the notes to William T. Thoms’ reprint of the above-named\r\n“now perfectly invalyable” work, he says: “It is quite clear from the\r\ntone in which Stow speaks of this ‘ugly shapen sight’ and the marks\r\n‘printed with a lion’s claw,’ that he suspected this instance of the\r\npower of the electric fluid to be nothing less than a visitation from\r\nthe foul fiend himself.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of St. Paul’s Cathedral, Stow tells us that its pulpit cross\r\n“was by tempest of lightning and thunder defaced,” and that “on\r\nWednesday, the fourth of June (in the year 1561), betweene three, four\r\nand five of the clock, in the after-noone, the steeple of Paule’s in\r\nLondon, being fired by lightning brast forth (as it seemed to the\r\nbeholders) two or three yards beneath the foote of the crosse, and from\r\nthence burnt downe the speere to the stone worke and bels, so terribly,\r\nthat within the space of foure houres, the same steeple with the roofes\r\nof the church ... were consumed.” Very curious and interesting reading\r\nwill be found in the “Burnynge of Paule Church, London, in 1561, and\r\nthe iiii day of June, by lyghtnynge at three of the clocke ...” by\r\nWyllyam Seres, London, 1563; as well as in his previous work on like\r\nsubject, published in 1561.

F. de la Perriere de Roiffé\r\n(not Reiffé) is the author of “Méchanismes de l’Electricité et de\r\nl’Univers,” published at Paris, wherein he pretends to account for all\r\nelectrical phenomena.\r\n\r\nAt p. 12 of his Préface, he curiously states that as everybody\r\ncomprehends the distinction between elastic and non-elastic bodies,\r\nlikewise the existence, nature and diversity of the properties of\r\natmospheric fluids, with which all bodies are impregnated and by which\r\nthey are surrounded, also the various expansive modes of activity to\r\nwhich they are subject, as well as their immiscibility as regards the\r\nsurrounding air, without which latter they could not, however, subsist,\r\nhe will in his new theory apply these principles to the mechanisms of\r\nelectricity and of the universe as affected by the general laws and the\r\ninvariable results attaching to shock and motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1756.=--In the “Subtil Medium Proved,” etc., of Mr. R.\r\nLovett, lay-clerk of the cathedral church at Worcester, England, are\r\nshown numerous medical cures successfully made by electricity.

Brit.,” Fifth\r\nDissertation of the eighth edition, Vol. I. p. 742).\r\n\r\nHe adopted the theory of Descartes that the magnetic fluid moves\r\nfrom the equator to the poles, and he endeavoured to determine\r\nmathematically the course of the magnetic needle over the earth’s\r\nsurface. He announces that “the magnetic direction on the earth follows\r\nalways the small circle which passes through the given place and the\r\ntwo magnetic poles of the earth,” or, as worded by Sir David Brewster,\r\nthat “the horizontal needle is a tangent to the circle passing through\r\nthe place of observation and through the two points on the earth’s\r\nsurface where the dipping needle becomes vertical or the horizontal\r\nneedle loses its directive power.”\r\n\r\nHe entertained very peculiar ideas regarding the source of power\r\nin the loadstone, the pores of which he imagined were filled with\r\nvalves admitting of the entrance of the current and preventing its\r\nreturn. His notions on this subject are best given in his own words:\r\n“Non-magnetic bodies are freely pervaded by the magnetic matter in all\r\ndirections; loadstones were pervaded by it in one direction only ...\r\nwater, we know, contains in its pores particles of air ... air, again,\r\nit is equally certain, contains in its pores a fluid incomparably\r\nmore subtile, viz. _æther_, and which, on many occasions, is\r\nseparated from it, as in Electricity; and now we see a still further\r\nprogression, and that ether contains a matter much more subtile than\r\nitself--the magnetic matter which may, perhaps, contain in its turn\r\nothers still more subtile.... The loadstone, besides a great many pores\r\nfilled with ether, like all other bodies, contains some still much more\r\nnarrow into which the _magnetic matter_ alone can find admission.\r\nThese pores are disposed in such a manner as to have communication with\r\neach other, and constitute tubes or canals through which the magnetic\r\nmatter passes from the one extremity to the other. Finally, this matter\r\ncan be transmitted through these tubes only in one direction, without\r\nthe possibility of returning in the opposite direction.... As we see\r\nnothing that impels the iron toward the loadstone, we say that the\r\nlatter attracts it. It cannot be doubted, however, that there is a\r\nvery subtile, though invisible matter, which produces this effect by\r\nactually impelling the iron towards the loadstone.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Journal des Savants” for March and April 1868;\r\n   Euler’s “Letters,” translated into English, 1802, Vol. I. p.\r\n   214, and Vol. II. pp. 240, 242, 244; “Berlin Memoirs,” for\r\n   1746, p. 117; 1757, p. 175; 1766, p. 213; _Poggendorff_, Vol.\r\n   I. p. 702; “Nova Act.

He gives the name of _spontaneous_ to the electricity\r\nproduced by the liquefaction of electrics, observing that the\r\nelectricity of melted sulphur does not appear until it commences to\r\ncool and to contract, its _maximum_ being reached at its point of\r\ngreatest contraction. Melted sealing wax, he says, becomes negatively\r\nelectrified when poured into glass, but, when poured into sulphur, it\r\nis positively electrified, leaving the sulphur negative (Sir Humphry\r\nDavy, “Bakerian Lectures,” London, 1840, p. 36 and notes).\r\n\r\nWhile in Berlin, he and Æpinus investigate the subject of electric\r\natmospheres, and they are led to the discovery that plates of air\r\ncan be charged in the same manner as plates of glass. (See Canton,\r\nA.D. 1753.) This they did by suspending large wooden boards,\r\nwhich were covered with tin and whose flat surfaces were held parallel\r\nto and near each other. They found that upon electrifying one of the\r\nboards positively the other was always negative, and that with them\r\ncould be given shocks like those produced by a Leyden jar. They likened\r\nthe state of the boards to the condition of the clouds and the earth\r\nduring a thunderstorm, the earth being in one state and the clouds in\r\nthe opposite, the body of air between them answering the same purpose\r\nas the small plate of air between the boards or the plate of glass\r\nbetween the two metallic coatings of the Leyden jar.\r\n\r\nIn Wilcke’s treatise, alluded to below, he defines the two\r\nelectricities much more clearly than had previously been done.\r\nHe distinguishes three causes of excitation, viz. _warming_,\r\n_liquefaction_ and _friction_; the _spontaneous electricity_ already\r\nalluded to, he further says, is the result of the apposition or\r\nmutual action of two bodies, in consequence of which one of them\r\nis electrified positively and the other negatively; _communicated\r\nelectricity_, on the other hand, is that which is superinduced upon the\r\nwhole or part of a body, electric or non-electric, without the body\r\nhaving been previously heated, melted or rubbed, or without any mutual\r\naction between it and any other body. This distinction is, in general,\r\nvery obvious, but Mr. Wilcke defines it throughout his work in a very\r\nclear manner, citing cases wherein they are frequently confounded.\r\n\r\nWilcke and Anton Brugmans (A.D. 1778) first propounded the theory of\r\ntwo magnetic fluids, which was afterward established by Coulomb (A.D.\r\n1785) and perfected by the great mathematician Poisson (A.D. 1811).\r\nThe hypothesis of the two fluids supposes that a magnet contains\r\nminute invisible particles of iron, each of which possesses by itself\r\nthe properties of a separate magnet. It is assumed that there are two\r\ndistinct fluids--the _austral_ and the _boreal_--which reside in each\r\nparticle of iron. These fluids are inert and neutral when combined, as\r\nin ordinary iron, but when they are decomposed the particles of the\r\n_austral_ attract those of the _boreal_, and _vice versa_, while they\r\neach repel one another.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Wilcke, “Disputatio inauguralis physica,” etc.,\r\n   published Rostock, 1757, also his “Herrn Franklin’s briefe von\r\n   der electricitat,” etc., Leipzig, 1758, his “Jal om Magneten,”\r\n   1764, and his “Über den Magneten,” Leipzig, 1758; besides\r\n   1794–1795; likewise his different Memoirs in the “Swedisches\r\n   Musæum,” Vol. I. p. 31, and in both the “Schwedischen Akad.\r\n   Abhandlungen,” etc. (also _Neue Abhand_.) and the “Vetensk Acad.\r\n   Handl.” for 1758, 1759, 1761–1763, 1766–1770, 1772, 1775, 1777,\r\n   1780, 1782, 1785, 1786, 1790; “The Electrical Researches of Hon.\r\n   Hy.

One of the most interesting of these\r\ndemonstrates the progressive motion of the electrical discharge.

W.\r\nMoulton, Buffalo, 1901–1902, Vol. IV. pp. 110–129).\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1759.=--Æpinus (Franz Maria Ulrich Theodor) (1724–1802),\r\ncelebrated German natural philosopher, member of the Scientific\r\nAcademies of Berlin and St. Petersburg, publishes in the latter\r\ncity his most important work, “Tentamen Theoriæ Electricitatis et\r\nMagnetismi,” wherein he adopts, as did Wilcke, all the general\r\nprinciples of Franklin’s theory of positive and negative electricities.\r\nTherein he also shows that the phenomena of electricity depend mainly\r\nupon the tendency of the fluid to attain a state of equilibrium by\r\npassing from bodies containing an excess to others which have less\r\nthan the natural quantity; that the electric fluid existing in the\r\npores of all bodies moves without obstruction in non-electrics and\r\nwith much difficulty in electrics; that all bodies contain a fluid\r\nwhose particles mutually repel one another with forces decreasing as\r\nthe distance between them increases, and, according to the same law,\r\nattract the particles of the bodies with which they are in combination.\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that, in conjunction with Wilcke, he found\r\nthe means of charging a plate of air. This experiment, suggested by\r\nsome of the observations made by Canton and Franklin, led to what\r\nmay be considered one of the greatest discoveries in the science of\r\nelectricity, for in this was first demonstrated the grand principle\r\nof induction (see Grey at A.D. 1720), and the result led to\r\nVolta’s discovery of the _electrophorus_. Volta, also, was the\r\nfirst to apply to an electrometer the apparatus invented by Æpinus for\r\ncondensing electricity.\r\n\r\nÆpinus first discovers to its fullest the affinity existing between\r\nelectricity and magnetism, explaining nearly all the phenomena of\r\nmagnetism (“De Similitudine vis electricæ et magneticæ”; “Similitudinis\r\neffectuum vis magnet. et. elect.: novum specimen” in the “Novi Comment.\r\nAcad. Petrop.,” Vol. X. p. 296). He improves upon the methods employed\r\nby both Duhamel and Michell for the construction of artificial magnets\r\nin a different line from that employed by John Canton, A.D.\r\n1753. He lays the bar to be magnetized upon the ends of the opposite\r\npoles of two powerful field magnets, and places two bunches of magnetic\r\nbars upon the middle of the bar, separating the bunches by a piece of\r\nwood and keeping together the poles of each of the same name as that\r\nof the powerful fixed magnet nearest to it. These two bunches are then\r\nheld at an inclination of 15 to 20 degrees, and are drawn away from\r\neach other to the end of the bar which is to be magnetized, so that\r\neach half of the bar receives the same number of strokes. When the bar\r\nis very thick, the process should be repeated upon its reverse, and\r\nin order to make the result more effective, the united ends of the\r\nbars should at the outset be ground together, and pressure should be\r\napplied while the operation is going on.\r\n\r\nÆpinus was the first to discover the polarity of the tourmaline. After\r\nM. Lechman acquainted him with its attractive power, he made many\r\nexperiments, of which he communicated the very important results,\r\nduring the year 1756, to the Academy of Sciences and Belles-Lettres at\r\nBerlin. Up to this time but little was known regarding the necessity\r\nof heat to excite the tourmaline. Æpinus found that he could electrify\r\nit to a high degree by placing the stone in boiling water, and that\r\nit was necessary to heat it to between 99½ degrees and 212 degrees\r\nFahrenheit to develop its attractive powers. One of the extremities of\r\nthe tourmaline terminated by the six-sided pyramid then becomes charged\r\nwith positive electricity, while the other extremity is negative. When\r\nthe stone is of considerable size, flashes of light can be seen along\r\nits surface.\r\n\r\nM. De Romé Delisle, in his “Essai de Cristallographie,” Paris, 1772, p.\r\n268, alludes to what has already been stated relative to the necessity\r\nof heating the tourmaline (see J. G. S. at A.D. 1707, and\r\nLeméry at A.D. 1717), and he gives an extract from the work\r\nattributed to Adanson, as mentioned at A.D. 1751. Delisle’s\r\nreferences embrace: “Act.

He says that equal quantities of these fluids\r\nare contained in all bodies while in their natural condition; that when\r\na body is positively electrified it does not hold a larger share of\r\nelectric matter, but a larger portion of one of the active powers, and\r\nwhen negatively electrified a larger portion of the other, and not, as\r\nFranklin’s theory supposes, an actual deficiency of electric matter.\r\nSymmer’s theory is perhaps best explained in his own words, as follows:\r\n“It is my opinion that there are two electric fluids (or emanations of\r\ntwo distinct electric powers), essentially different from each other;\r\nthat electricity does not consist in the efflux and afflux of these\r\nfluids, but in the accumulation of the one or the other in the body\r\nelectrified; or, in other words, it consists in the possession of a\r\nlarger portion of the one or of the other power than is requisite to\r\nmaintain an even balance within the body, and lastly, that according as\r\nthe one or the other power prevails, the body is electrified in one or\r\nthe other manner.”\r\n\r\nVery curious reading may be had by reference to the volumes of the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_ named below, in which Symmer details many\r\nexperiments with pieces of silk, as well as with white and coloured,\r\nnew and newly cleansed silk and worsted stockings. Therein he shows\r\nhis ability to charge the Leyden jar with either positive or negative\r\nelectricity, according as he presents a black or white stocking to the\r\nwire of the phial. These experiments, which Symmer admits to have made\r\nfor the express purpose of proving the existence of two electricities,\r\nfurther illustrate the phenomenon of electrical cohesion, although\r\nthe latter is still better demonstrated by means of panes of ordinary\r\nglass. He thus expresses himself: “Upon these considerations, we may\r\nexpect, from the experiment in hand, the means of determining whether\r\nthe distinction of electricity into two different kinds is merely\r\nnominal, or if there is an essential difference between them; for,\r\nafter the glass plates have been electrified in one position, so as to\r\nbe incapable of receiving any more electricity, if they be inverted,\r\nand in that new position presented to the chain and wire, and the globe\r\nagain be put in motion, according as one or other of those opinions\r\nhold, corresponding effects will follow.”\r\n\r\nSymmer also proves his two distinct powers of electricity by the\r\nexperiment of passing the electric shock through a quire of paper\r\ninstead of through a single card (“Lib. Useful Knowledge,” London,\r\n1829, “Electricity,” p. 44).\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Electricity in the Service of Man,” R.

He believes that lightning does not\r\nmelt metal by a cold fusion, as Dr. Franklin and himself had formerly\r\nsupposed, and that when it passes, for instance, through the blade of\r\na sword, if the quantity is not very great, it may heat the point so\r\nas to melt it, while the broadest and the thickest part may not be\r\nsensibly warmer than before.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the effects of electricity upon air, Kinnersley devised\r\nan instrument which he called an _electrical air thermometer_,\r\nand which is described at p. 626, Vol. VIII of the 1855 “Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica.” With this he could show the sudden rarefaction which air\r\nundergoes during the passage of the electric spark through it, heat\r\nbeing produced without accompaniment of any chemical change in the\r\nheated body.\r\n\r\nSome other important observations made by Kinnersley, who, besides\r\nbeing an intimate friend, was the original associate of Ben. Franklin,\r\nare summed up as follows: A coated flask containing boiling water\r\ncannot be charged, the electricity passing off with the steam; but when\r\nthe water gets cold the flask may be charged as usual. A person in a\r\nnegative state of electricity standing upon an electric, and holding up\r\na long sharp needle out of doors in the dark, observes light upon the\r\npoint of it. No heat is produced by electrifying a thermometer, nor by\r\npassing shocks through large wire, but small wire is heated red-hot,\r\nexpanded and melted (_Phil. Trans._ for 1763, Vol. LIII. p. 84;\r\nThomson, “Hist. Roy. Soc.,” p. 445).\r\n\r\nIn the New York “Electrical Review” of May 13, 1905, will be found\r\nthe following curious reference to the Boston Art Club exhibits of\r\nPresident R. H. W. Dwight:\r\n\r\n“Among these is an interesting broadside, which gives a summary of\r\ntwo lectures on electricity by Ebenezer Kinnersley delivered in\r\nFaneuil Hall in September, 1751--the first lectures probably ever\r\ndelivered on the then new subject of electricity. Kinnersley was an\r\nEnglishman, who was head master in English literature in the College\r\nof Philadelphia, from 1753 to 1773, a student of science, who made a\r\nnumber of discoveries in electricity and invented a number of quaint\r\nelectrical devices. He and Franklin were on intimate terms, and were\r\nclosely associated in their electrical experiments. Kinnersley has\r\nbeen erroneously cited as an anticipator of Oersted’s discovery of the\r\ndeflection of a magnetic needle by an electric current. The former’s\r\nexperiment, however, was purely electrostatic. In the summary of these\r\ntwo lectures, among other things, it states that electricity ‘is an\r\nextremely subtile fluid; that it doth not take up any perceptible time\r\nin passing through large portions of space; that it is mixed with the\r\nsubstance of all other fluids and solids of our globe; that our bodies\r\nat all times contain enough of it to set a house on fire.’”\r\n\r\nThe exhibits of President Dwight are:\r\n\r\n“An artificial spider animated by the electric fire so as to act like\r\na live one; a shower of sand which rises again as fast as it falls; a\r\nleaf of the most mighty of metals suspended in the air, as is said of\r\nMahomet’s tomb; electrified money which scarce anybody will take when\r\noffered to them; a curious machine, acting by means of the electric\r\nfire, and playing a variety of tunes on eight musical bells.”\r\n\r\nThis broadside of 1751 appears to antedate any other similar notice of\r\nelectrical experiments.\r\n\r\nThe “Electrical Review” of April 23, 1904, p. 621, had published copy\r\nof an advertisement from the Massachusetts _Gazette_ of March 7,\r\n1765, giving notice of a course of lectures by David Mason, illustrated\r\nby “entertaining experiments on electricity similar to those cited in\r\nthe broadside under date of 1751.” The advertisement of 1765, here\r\nreferred to, appears at A.D. 1771.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Sturgeon’s “Lectures,” London, 1842, p. 169; “The\r\n   Electrical Researches of Hon.

C. Bakewell, “Manual of Electricity”\r\nLondon, 1857, Chap. III. p. 28).\r\n\r\nThe passage in the edition “Nouvelle Théorie des Plaisirs,” published\r\nin 1767, is thus given by Sabine, “Electric Telegraph,” 1872, p. 15:\r\n“On taking two pieces of different metals--silver and zinc--and placing\r\none of them above and the other underneath his tongue, he found that,\r\nso long as the metals did not make contact with each other, he felt\r\nnothing; but that when the edges were brought together over the tip\r\nof his tongue, the moment contact took place and during the time it\r\nlasted, he experienced an itching sensation and a taste resembling\r\nthat of sulphate of iron....” Sulzer does not appear to have been much\r\nsurprised at the result, thinking it “not improbable that, by the\r\ncombination of the two metals, a solution of either of them may have\r\ntaken place, in consequence of which the dissolved particles penetrate\r\ninto the tongue; or we may conjecture that the combination of these\r\nmetals occasions a trembling motion in the respective particles, which,\r\nexciting the nerves of the tongue, causes that peculiar sensation.”\r\n\r\nAnd thus, remarks Pepper, a prominent fact has slept in obscurity from\r\nthe time of Sulzer to the time of Galvani.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Izarn, “Manuel,” Paris, 1804, p. 4; Sturgeon,\r\n   _Annals_, Vol. VIII. p. 363; also note at p. 491 of Ronalds’\r\n   “Catalogue”; _Mém. de l’Acad. de Berlin_, “Théorie Générale du\r\n   Plaisir”; also “Temple du Bonheur,” published at Bouillon (Pays\r\n   Bas), 1769, Tome III. p. 124, this last-named work being alluded\r\n   to in the _Journal des Débats_, 7 Vendémiaire, au X; Edm.

He thus supplies\r\nthe main defect of Dufay’s theory (A.D. 1733) by proving that the two\r\nopposite electricities are produced simultaneously.

In the second Memoir the curves of the magnetic\r\ncurrent are investigated by the action of the directive or polar force\r\nof a magnet upon a small needle. Lambert concludes that the effect\r\nof each particle of the magnet on each particle of the needle, and\r\nreciprocally, is as the absolute force or magnetic intensity of the\r\nparticles directly, and as the squares of the distances inversely.\r\n\r\nNoad states (“Manual,” London, 1859, p. 580) that Lambert’s deductions\r\nwere confirmed twenty years later by Coulomb, through the agency of his\r\ndelicate torsion balance, and more recently (about the year 1817) by\r\nProf. Hansteen, of Christiania.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the above-named date, in 1760, Lambert had published,\r\nboth at Leipzig and at Augsburg, his “Photometria, sive de Mensura et\r\nGradibus Luminis, Colorum et Umbræ,” the sequel to a tract printed two\r\nyears before, wherein he indicates the mode of measuring the intensity\r\nof the light of various bodies. The celebrated mathematician and\r\nastronomer, Pierre Bouguer (1698–1758), who had published, in 1729, his\r\n“Essai d’Optique,” etc., which was greatly enlarged in his “Traité,”\r\netc., brought out by La Caille in 1760, may be considered the founder\r\nof this branch of the science of optics, to which the name _photometry_\r\nhas been given by English writers. The photometer designed by Sir\r\nBenjamin Thompson, _Count Rumford_ (entered at A.D. 1802), has been\r\ndescribed in _Phil. Trans._ for 1794, Vol. LXVII. His method is to cast\r\ntwo shadows of a given object near each other on the same surface, the\r\nlights being removed to such distances that the shadows appear equally\r\ndark.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Sir John Leslie’s “Fifth Dissertation” in the\r\n   eighth “Encycl.

At p.\r\n38 of the same work he details the experiments made to prove the\r\ncorrectness of Mollet’s doctrine regarding the constant motion of\r\nelectrical atmospheres, and at p. 42 are given his experiments to show\r\nthe production of electricity in the clouds. With a long insulated pole\r\nprojecting from the mountain side he observed, among other effects,\r\nthat when small clouds of vapour produced by the sun’s heat touched\r\nonly the end of the pole the latter was electrified, but that it was\r\nnot affected if the entire pole was covered by the vapour (“Lib. Useful\r\nKnowledge,” “Electricity,” Chap. XI. Nos. 154, etc.).\r\n\r\nLullin, it is said, proposed a modification of Reusser’s plan of\r\ntelegraphing, in manner stated at p. 69 of Reid’s 1887 “Telegraph in\r\nAmerica.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1766.=--L’Abbé Poncelet, a native of Verdun, France, publishes\r\nat Paris “La Nature dans la formation du Tonnerre,” etc., wherein he\r\nindicates a method of protecting from lightning residences, pavilions\r\nand other structures, by constructing them of resinous woods and lining\r\nthem with either silk or waxed cloths. He quaintly remarks that as\r\nthey thus present “on all sides resinous surfaces, which never receive\r\nphlogiston by communication, the latter (thunder and lightning), after\r\nhaving leaped lightly around the pavilion and finding itself unable\r\nto attack it, will probably depart in order to pursue its ravages\r\nelsewhere.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Scientific American Supplement_, No. 66, p. 1053,\r\n   for a copy of the frontispiece of the above-named work; also\r\n   Figuier, “Exposition et Histoire,” etc., 1857, Vol. IV. pp. 234,\r\n   235.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1767.=--Bozolus (Joseph), an Italian Jesuit, Professor of\r\nNatural Philosophy at Rome, is the first (and not Cavallo, A.D. 1775)\r\nto suggest employing the active principle of the Leyden jar for the\r\ntransmission of intelligence.\r\n\r\nHis plan is to place underground two wires which are to be brought\r\nat each station close enough to admit of the passage of a spark. One\r\nof the wires is to be connected with the inner coating and the other\r\nwith the outer surface of a Leyden phial; the sparks observed at the\r\nopening between the wires being there made to express any meaning\r\naccording to a preconcerted code of signals.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Latin poem entitled “Mariani Parthenii\r\n   Electricorum,” in six books, Roma, 1767, lib. i. p. 34\r\n   (describing the _telegrafo elettrico scintillante_); also\r\n   _Saturday Review_, August 21, 1858, p. 190, and _Cornhill\r\n   Magazine_ for 1860, Vol. II. p. 66.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1767.=--Priestley (Joseph), the earliest historian of electrical\r\nscience, publishes, by advice of Benjamin Franklin, the first edition\r\nof his great work, “The History and Present State of Electricity,” of\r\nwhich there were four other separate enlarged issues, in 1769, 1775,\r\n1775 and 1794. During the year 1766 he had been given the degree of\r\nDoctor of Laws by the Edinburgh University and he had also, at the\r\ninstance of Franklin, Watson and others, been made a member of the\r\nEnglish Royal Society, which, a few years later, bestowed upon him the\r\nCopley medal.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the above-named work, Dr. Lardner says (“Lectures, 1859,\r\nVol. I. p. 136): “This philosopher did not contribute materially to the\r\nadvancement of the science by the development of any new facts; but\r\nin his ‘History of Electricity’ he collected and arranged much useful\r\ninformation respecting the progress of the science.” Nevertheless,\r\nto him is due the first employment of the conductor supported by an\r\ninsulating pillar, as described by Noad, who gives an account of\r\nPriestley’s electrical machine at Chap. IV of his “Manual”; and he is\r\nalso the first to investigate upon an extensive scale the chemical\r\neffects of ordinary electricity. The observations of M. Warltire, a\r\nlecturer on natural philosophy, and Priestley’s own experiments in\r\nthis line, made by passing the electric spark through water tinged\r\nblue by litmus, also through olive oil, turpentine, etc., as well as\r\nhis researches more particularly upon the gases and upon the influence\r\nof the electric fluid in expanding solid bodies, are detailed at the\r\n“Electricity” chapter of the “Encycl. Brit.”\r\n\r\nAt pp. 660–665 of the fourth edition of his “History,” Priestley\r\ndescribes the experiments he made to illustrate what he called the\r\n_lateral force of electrical explosions_; that is, the tendency of\r\nthe fluid to diverge, as is the case with lightning when any material\r\nobstruction lies in its path.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important of all Dr. Priestley’s electrical\r\ndiscoveries (Thomson, “Hist. Roy. Soc.,” p. 445) was that charcoal is\r\na conductor of electricity, and so good a conductor that it vies even\r\nwith the metals themselves. When the conducting power of charcoal was\r\ntried by succeeding electricians, it was found to vary in the most\r\nunaccountable manner, sometimes scarcely conducting at all, sometimes\r\nimperfectly and sometimes remarkably well; a diversity naturally\r\nindicating some difference in the nature of the different specimens\r\nof English charcoal (Priestley’s “History,” etc., Part VIII. s. 3).\r\nCharcoal being examined by Mr. Kinnersley (at A.D. 1761), was\r\nalso by him observed to vary in its conducting power. Oak, beech and\r\nmaple charcoal he found to conduct satisfactorily; the charcoal from\r\nthe pine would not conduct at all, while a line drawn upon paper by a\r\nheavy black lead pencil conducted pretty well (_Phil.

The rod is usually divided into inches and tenths,\r\nindicating the force of the discharge which takes place when the\r\nknob of the jar is placed in contact with the prime conductor of an\r\nelectrical machine, and the charge is strong enough to leap from one to\r\nthe other. In Mr. Lane’s experiments the shocks were twice as frequent\r\nwhen the interval between the balls was one twenty-fourth of an inch\r\nas when twice as much: from which he concluded that the quantity of\r\nelectricity required for a discharge is in exact proportion to the\r\ndistance between the surfaces of the balls.\r\n\r\nA combination of the Lane and other electrometers was made by Mr.\r\nCuthbertson, as shown at p. 528, Vol. II of _Nicholson’s Journal of\r\nNatural Philosophy_, and at p. 451, Vol. LVII of the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Phil.

He alludes (“Natural History of Guiana”)\r\nalso to the _gymnotus electricus_, which, he says, gives much stronger\r\nstrokes than the _torpedo_; the shocks received from the larger animals\r\nbeing almost invariably fatal.\r\n\r\nThe discharge of the _gymnotus_ has been estimated to be equal to that\r\nof a battery of Leyden jars of three thousand five hundred square\r\ninches, fully charged. At a later date, the American physicians, Garden\r\nand Williamson, showed that as the fluid discharged by that fish\r\naffects the same parts that are affected by the electric fluid; as it\r\nexcites sensations perfectly similar; as it kills and stuns animals in\r\nthe same manner; as it is conveyed by the same bodies that carry the\r\nelectric fluid and refuses to be conveyed by others that refuse to take\r\nthe fluid, it must be the electric fluid itself, and the shock given by\r\nthe eel must be the electric shock.\r\n\r\nHumboldt, speaking of the results obtained by M. Samuel Fahlberg,\r\nof Sweden, says: “This philosopher has seen an electric spark, as\r\nWalsh and Ingen-housz had done before him at London, by placing the\r\n_gymnotus_ in the air and interrupting the conducting chain by\r\ntwo gold leaves pasted upon glass and a line distant from each other”\r\n(_Edinburgh Journal_, Vol. II. p. 249). Faraday, who gives this\r\nextract at paragraph 358 of his “Experimental Researches” says he could\r\nnot, however, find any record of such an observation by either Walsh or\r\nIngen-housz and does not know where to refer to that by Fahlberg.

F. Partington, with appendix, London, 1825.)\r\n\r\nIn his first lecture he says that the most remarkable properties of the\r\nloadstone are: (1) it attracts iron and steel only; (2) it constantly\r\nturns one of its sides to the north and the other to the south, when\r\nsuspended to a thread that does not twist; (3) it communicates all its\r\nproperties to a piece of steel when rubbed upon it without losing any\r\nitself. He cites the experiments of Dr. Helsham, according to whom,\r\nsays he, the attraction of the loadstone decreases as the square of the\r\ndistance increases. He also treats of electrical attraction generally,\r\nand reports in the sixth lecture having “heard that lightning,\r\nstriking upon the mariner’s compass, will sometimes turn it round and\r\noften make it stand the contrary way, or with the north pole towards\r\nthe south.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1770.=--Hell--Hehl--Heyl--Höll (Maximilian), Hungarian scientist\r\n(1720–1792), member of the Order of Jesuits and Professor of Astronomy\r\nat Vienna, who had great faith in the influence of the loadstone,\r\ninvented a singular arrangement of steel plates to which he afterward\r\nattributed the cure “with extraordinary success” of many diseases, as\r\nwell as of a severe attack of rheumatism from which he himself had long\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nHe communicated his discovery to Friedrich Anton Mesmer, who was so\r\nstrongly impressed by Hell’s observations that he immediately procured\r\nevery conceivable description of magnet, with which he made many\r\nexperiments that led to his introduction of animal magnetism, or rather\r\n_mesmerism_.\r\n\r\nHe is the author of many works, the most important being “Elementa\r\nAlgebræ Joannis Crivelii magis illustrata et novis demonstrationibus et\r\nproblematibus aucta,” Vienna, 1745; “Observ.

David Mason, a prominent figure among the patriots\r\nat Leslie’s Retreat, gave a course of lectures on ‘Electricity’ at\r\nhis house near North Bridge. The Rev. John Prince, LL.D., minister\r\nof the First Church from 1779 to 1836, was especially interested in\r\nelectricity, and is said to have made the first electrical machine\r\nin Salem, if not in the country. Col. Francis Peabody, assisted by\r\nJonathan Webb, the apothecary, was much interested in the subject, and,\r\nin 1829, gave a series of lectures, illustrated with a machine made\r\nby himself, which had a glass plate wheel imported from Germany at a\r\nreported cost of $1500.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Charles Grafton Page, another native of Salem, invented the first\r\nelectric motor in which solenoids were used, and as early as 1850\r\nconstructed a motor which developed over 10 h.p. The next year he made\r\na trial trip with his electro-magnetic locomotive over the Baltimore\r\nand Washington Railroad. Prof. Moses Gerrish Farmer lived in Pearl\r\nStreet between the years 1850 and 1870, and, as far back as 1859,\r\nilluminated the house with divided electric lights--_probably the\r\nfirst time that any house in the world was lighted by electricity_.\r\nIn 1847 Prof. Farmer had constructed and exhibited in public an\r\nelectro-magnetic locomotive drawing a car holding two passengers, on a\r\ntrack one foot and a half wide.\r\n\r\n“Many of Prof. Alexander Graham Bell’s early experiments were conducted\r\nin Salem, and the first lecture on the telephone in this country, if\r\nnot in the world, was delivered by him before the Essex Institute\r\nin Lyceum Hall, February 12, 1877. The late Prof. Osbun, teacher of\r\nchemistry and physics at the Normal School in Salem, was also an\r\nelectrical expert. He exhibited the first arc lights in Salem, and\r\nwas the inventor of the storage battery system from which lights were\r\nexhibited.”\r\n\r\nThe advertisement of March 7, 1765, previously alluded to herein at\r\nKinnersley, A.D. 1761, is as follows:\r\n\r\n                    “A COURSE OF EXPERIMENTS ON THE\r\n\r\nnewly discovered _Electrical Fire_, to be accompanied with methodical\r\nLECTURES on the Nature and Properties of that wonderful Element\r\nwill be exhibited by DAVID MASON, at his House opposite Mr. _Thomas\r\nJackson_; Distiller, near Sudbury-Street.--To consist of two Lectures,\r\nat one Pistareen each Lecture.--The first Lectures to be on Monday and\r\nThursday, and the Second on Tuesday and Friday Evenings every week,\r\nWeather permitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      “OF ELECTRICITY IN GENERAL\r\n\r\n“That the Electric Fire is a real Element,--That our Bodies at all\r\nTimes contain enough of it to set an House on Fire,--That this Fire\r\nwill live in Water,--A Representation of the seven Planets, shewing a\r\nprobable Cause of their keeping their due Distances from each other,\r\nand the Sun in the Centre,--The Salute repulsed by the Ladies’ Fire,\r\nor Fire darting from a Lady’s Lips, so that she may defy any Person to\r\nsalute her,--A Battery of Eleven Guns discharged by the Electric Spark,\r\nafter it has passed through eight Feet of Water,--Several Experiments\r\nshewing that the Electric Fire and Lightning are the same, and that\r\nPoints will draw off the Fire so as to prevent the Stroke,--With a\r\nnumber of other entertaining Experiments, too many to be inserted in an\r\nAdvertisement.\r\n\r\n“TICKETS to be had either at his House above or at his Shop in\r\nQueen-Street.”\r\n\r\nAnother advertisement, which appeared in the Salem _Gazette_ of\r\nTuesday, January 1, 1771, is thus worded: “To-morrow evening (if\r\nthe Air be dry) will be exhibited A Course of Experiments in that\r\ninstructive and entertaining branch of Natural Philosophy called\r\nElectricity; to be accompanied with Methodical Lectures on the nature\r\nand properties of the wonderful element; by David Mason, at his\r\ndwelling-house near the North-Bridge.

The results proved so favourable that Hell was induced\r\nto publish an account of them, but he incurred the displeasure of his\r\nfriend by attributing the cures merely to the _form_ of the plates.\r\n\r\nMesmer subsequently arrived at the conclusion that the magnet was\r\nincapable, by itself, of so acting upon the nerves as to produce the\r\nresults obtained and that another principle was necessarily involved;\r\nhe did not, however, give an explanation of it, and managed to keep his\r\nprocess a secret for quite a while. He had observed that nearly all\r\nsubstances can be magnetized by the touch, and in due time he announced\r\nhis abandonment of the use of the magnet and of electricity in his\r\nproduction of what became known as _mesmerism_.\r\n\r\nIn 1779 he published his “Mémoire sur la découverte du magnétisme\r\nanimal,” in which he says: “I had maintained that the heavenly\r\nspheres possessed a direct power on all of the constituent principles\r\nof animated bodies, particularly on the _nervous system_, by\r\nthe agency of an all-penetrating fluid. I determined this action\r\nby the intension and the remission of the properties of matter and\r\norganized bodies, such as gravity, cohesion, elasticity, irritability\r\nand electricity. I supported this doctrine by various examples of\r\nperiodical revolutions; and I named that property of the animal matter\r\nwhich renders it susceptible to the action of celestial and earthly\r\nbodies, _animal magnetism_. A further consideration of the subject\r\nled me to the conviction that there does exist in nature a universal\r\nprinciple, which, independently of ourselves, performs all that we\r\nvaguely attribute to nature or to art.”\r\n\r\nThe whole theory and practice of mesmerism was, however, openly\r\nrejected by one of Mesmer’s most capable pupils, Claude Louis\r\nBerthollet (A.D. 1803), a very distinguished French chemical\r\nphilosopher, founder of the “Société Chimique d’Arcueil,” and who, in\r\nconjunction with Lavoisier (A.D. 1781), Guyton de Morveau (A.D. 1771),\r\nand Fourcroy (A.D. 1801), planned the new philosophical nomenclature\r\nwhich has since proved of such service to chemical science (“La Grande\r\nEncycl.,” Tome VI. p. 449; “Biog. Universelle,” Tome IV. pp. 141–149).\r\n\r\nMesmer gave all his manuscripts to Dr. Wolfart, of Berlin, who\r\npublished in 1814, “Mesmerism ... as the general curative of mankind.”\r\nAnd it was one of Mesmer’s students, le Marquis de Puységur, who\r\ndiscovered magnetic somnambulism, an entirely new phenomenon in animal\r\nmagnetism. (See the article “Somnambulism” in the “Encyl.

It is generally attached to the prime\r\nconductor to measure the state of action of the electrical machine.\r\n\r\nHe is also the inventor of the _universal discharger_, for\r\ndirecting the charge of jars or batteries (Edw. Whitaker\r\nGray--1748–1807--“Observations on manner glass is charged and\r\ndischarged by the electric fluid” in Hutton’s abridgments, Vol. XVI. p.\r\n407).\r\n\r\nIn the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1774, Henley and Nairne give an\r\naccount of many curious experiments proving the superiority of points\r\nover balls as conductors. The same is shown by William Swift in the\r\n_Phil. Trans._, Vol. LXVIII. p. 155. (For Wm. Swift consult, besides,\r\nthe _Phil. Trans._, Vol. LXIX. p. 454, and Hutton’s abridgments,\r\nVol. XIV. pp. 314, 571.) Henley also states that the vapour of water\r\nis a conductor of electricity; that when the flame of a candle is\r\nintroduced into the circuit and a Leyden jar is discharged through it,\r\nthe flame always inclines toward the negative side; and he proves that\r\nelectricity cannot effect a passage through glass (_Phil. Trans._,\r\nVol. LXVIII. p. 1049). He likewise makes a number of experiments\r\nto determine the relative conducting power of the different metals\r\naccording to the quantity of a wire, each of a given size, melted by\r\nequal electrical shocks passed through them, and finds the metals to\r\nhold the order following as conductors: gold, brass, copper silvered,\r\nsilver, iron. It was also shown by Nairne that copper conducts better\r\nthan iron, in the _Phil. Trans._ for 1780, Vol. LXX. p. 334.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Harris, “Rud.

His papers embrace twenty-seven\r\nmathematical propositions upon the action of the electric fluid, and\r\ncontain the first distinct statement of the difference between common\r\nand animal electricity.\r\n\r\nCavendish made many very important experiments upon the relative\r\nconducting power of different substances. He found that a solution of\r\none part of salt in one part of water conducts a hundred times better,\r\nand that a saturated solution of sea-salt conducts seven hundred and\r\ntwenty times better than fresh water, also that electricity experiences\r\nas much resistance in passing through a column of water one inch long\r\nas it does in passing through an iron wire of the same diameter four\r\nhundred million inches long, whence he concludes that rain or distilled\r\nwater conducts four hundred million times less than iron wire.\r\n\r\nHe decomposed atmospheric air by means of the electric spark, and he\r\nsuccessfully demonstrated the formation of nitric acid by exploding a\r\ncombination of seven measures of oxygen with three of nitrogen. The\r\nlatter he did on the 6th of December, 1787, with the assistance of Mr.\r\nGeorge Gilpin, in presence of the English Royal Society. (For George\r\nGilpin, consult “Bibl. Britan.,” Vol. XXXVI, 1807, p. 3; _Phil.\r\nTrans._ for 1806.)\r\n\r\nHe improved upon Priestley’s experiments after studying thoroughly the\r\npower of electricity as a chemical agent. In one of his experiments\r\nhe fired as many as five hundred thousand measures of hydrogen with\r\nabout two and a half times that quantity of atmospheric air, and having\r\nby this means obtained 135 grains of pure water, he was led to the\r\nconclusion which Mr. Watt had previously maintained, that water is\r\ncomposed of two gases, viz. oxygen and hydrogen.\r\n\r\nHe explains why no spark is given by the electrical fishes: the latter\r\nmay contain sufficient electricity to give a shock without being able\r\nto make it traverse the space of air necessary for the production of a\r\nspark, as the distance through which the spark flies is inversely (or\r\nrather in a greater proportion) as the square root of the number of\r\njars in operation.\r\n\r\nFor an account of his experiments anticipating Faraday’s discovery\r\nof the specific inductive capacity of various substances, see Chap.\r\nXI. pp. 69–142 of Gordon’s “Physical Treatise,” etc., London, 1883.\r\nSee, likewise, J.

In\r\nthe letter announcing the fact, which he addressed to Franklin, then\r\nin London, he says: “He, who predicted and showed that electricity\r\nwings the formidable bolt of the atmosphere, will hear with attention\r\nthat in the deep it speeds a humbler bolt, silent and invisible; he,\r\nwho analyzed the electric phial, will hear with pleasure that its\r\nlaws prevail in _animated_ phials; he, who by reason became an\r\nelectrician, will hear with reverence of an instructive electrician\r\ngifted at its birth with a wonderful apparatus, and with skill to use\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nMr. Walsh’s experiments were made off Leghorn, in company with Dr.\r\nDrummond, as stated in _Phil.

Dr. Walsh gave him for examination a\r\nfish about eight inches long, two inches thick and twelve inches broad,\r\nand Hunter found in each electrical organ as many as 470 columns; but\r\nin a very large fish, four and a half feet long and weighing 73 pounds,\r\nhe counted as many as 1182 in each organ.\r\n\r\nHe remarks that there is no part of any animal with which he is\r\nacquainted, however strong and constant its natural action, which\r\nhas so great a proportion of nerves; and he concludes that, if it be\r\nprobable these nerves are not necessary for the purposes of sensation\r\nor action, they are subservient to the formation, collection or\r\nmanagement of the electric fluid.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Phil.

M., or Charles Morrison, at A.D. 1753). His\r\napparatus consists of twenty-four metallic wires insulated from each\r\nother and communicating with separate electrometers formed of small\r\nballs of elder held by threads and each marked with different letters\r\nof the alphabet. Whenever the electric current was transmitted, the\r\nballs indicated the desired letter.\r\n\r\nLesage was not, however, satisfied with a telegraph upon so small a\r\nscale as to be utilized only in one building, and on the 22nd of June\r\n1782 he addressed a letter to M. Pierre Prévost, at Geneva, on the\r\nsubject of “a ready and swift method of correspondence between two\r\ndistant places by means of electricity.” This, he says, had occurred\r\nto him thirty or thirty-five years before, and had been “then reduced\r\nto a simple system, far more practicable than the form with which\r\nthe new inventor has endowed it.” He employed a subterranean tube of\r\nglazed earthenware, divided at every fathom’s length by partitions with\r\ntwenty-four separate openings intended to hold apart that number of\r\nwires, the extremities of the wires being “arranged horizontally, like\r\nthe keys of a harpsichord, each wire having suspended above it a letter\r\nof the alphabet, while immediately underneath, upon a table, are pieces\r\nof gold leaf, or other bodies that can be as easily attracted, and are\r\nat the same time easily visible.” Upon touching the end of any wire\r\nwith an excited glass tube, its other extremity would cause the little\r\ngold leaf to play under a certain letter, which would form part of the\r\nintended message.\r\n\r\nGeorges Louis Lesage (sen.) wrote a work on “Meteors,” etc., published\r\nat Geneva in 1730, and alluded to in _Poggendorff_, Vol. I. p. 1433.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Abbé Moigno, “Traité,” etc., 2nd ed.

This work was followed in 1777, 1782, 1787,\r\n1795, 1802 by his “Complete Treatise on Electricity,” etc.; by his\r\n“Essay on the Theory and Practice of Medical Electricity” (London,\r\n1780, 1781; Leipzig, 1782, 1785; Naples, 1784); and during 1787\r\nwas also published in London the first edition of his “Treatise on\r\nMagnetism,” a supplement to which appeared eight years later.\r\n\r\nHe had made many very remarkable observations during the year 1787 on\r\nthe phenomena of electricity in glass tubes containing mercury, and he\r\nhad particularly experimented with various substances floating upon\r\nmercury in order to test their magnetism.\r\n\r\nBefore the year 1795 he contrived what he called a _multiplier of\r\nelectricity_, a good illustration of which is to be found, more\r\nparticularly, opposite p. 270, Vol. II. of his “Elements,” etc.,\r\npublished at Philadelphia in 1825. It consisted of two brass plates\r\ninsulated upon glass pillars, and of a third plate which could be\r\ninsulated or uninsulated at will, and which, turning on a pivot, or\r\nrather a movable arm, could be made to successively convey electricity\r\nfrom one plate to the other until the desired quantity was accumulated.\r\n(For the _multiplier_, see Jean Damel Colladon in “Bibl. Britan.,”\r\nVol. XXIX, N.S. for 1825, p. 316.)\r\n\r\nCavallo also invented a small electroscope and a _condenser of\r\nelectricity_. The latter consisted of an insulated tin plate between\r\nthe sides of a wooden frame lined with gilt paper, one edge of the\r\nplate being connected with the body containing the electricity, and\r\nthe condensation making itself observable at the opposite edge by the\r\nelectroscope.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth edition of his “Treatise on Electricity” (1795), which,\r\nlike the previous editions, was freely translated into other languages,\r\nwill be found at pp. 285–296 of the third volume mention of the\r\npossibility of transmitting intelligence by combinations of sparks and\r\npauses. For his experiments he made use of brass wires 250 English feet\r\nin length, and his electric alarm was based upon either the explosion\r\nof a mixture of hydrogen and of oxygen, or of gunpowder, phosphorus,\r\nphosphuretted hydrogen, etc., fired by the Leyden phial (vide Bozolus\r\nat A.D. 1767). It is in Vol. I. p. 358 of the afore-named\r\nfourth edition that Cavallo explains the mode of action of the charged\r\nLeyden jar. His concluding words deserve reproduction: “Which shows\r\nthat one side of a charged electric may contain a greater quantity\r\nof electricity than that which is sufficient to balance the contrary\r\nelectricity of the opposite side. This redundant electricity should be\r\ncarefully considered in performing experiments of a delicate nature.”\r\nThe same is expressed in other words in the 1825 American edition of\r\nhis “Natural Philosophy,” Chap. IV. Therein he asserts that glass is\r\nimpervious to the electric fluid, saying: “If the additional electric\r\nfluid penetrates a certain way into the substance of the glass, it\r\nfollows that a plate may be given so thin as to be permeable to the\r\nelectric fluid, and, of course, incapable of a charge; yet glass balls\r\nblown exceedingly thin, viz. about the six-hundredth part of an inch\r\nthick, when coated, etc., were found capable of holding a charge.”\r\n(Consult Cavendish’s experiments which produced this remarkable\r\ndiscovery, in _Phil. Trans._, Vols. LXXV and LXXVIII.)\r\n\r\nAn electrical machine used by Cavallo in 1777 had a glass cylinder\r\nrotated by means of a cord passing around the neck and the wheel, also\r\na cushion (amalgamated with two parts of mercury, one of tinfoil, some\r\npowdered chalk and grease) holding a silk flap and freely moving along\r\na groove, and provided with a prime conductor resting on glass legs and\r\nwith collecting points.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Sturgeon, “Lectures,” London, 1842, p. 12;\r\n   Young’s “Lectures,” London, 1807, Vol. I. pp. 682, 686, 694,\r\n   714; _Nicholson’s Journal_, 1797, Vol. I. p. 394; Du Moncel,\r\n   “Exposé,” Vol. III; Aikin’s “General Biography,” Vol. X; _Phil.\r\n   Transactions_, 1776, Vol. LXVI. p. 407; 1777, Vol. LXVII. pp.\r\n   48, 388; 1780, Vol. LXX. p. 15; 1786, p. 62; 1787, p. 6; 1788,\r\n   pp. 1 and 255, and 1793, p. 10 (Volta’s letters); likewise\r\n   Hutton’s abridgments, Vol. XVI. pp. 57, 170, 354, 449; Vol.\r\n   XIV. pp. 60, 129, 180, 608; see also “Encycl.

This consists of two\r\ncircular metallic plates having between them a round disc of resin,\r\nwhich is excited by being struck a number of times with either a\r\nsilk kerchief or pieces of dry warm fur or flannel. During 1782 he\r\ndiscovered what he called an electrical condenser, wherein the disc\r\nof resin is replaced by a plate of marble or of varnished wood. With\r\nthis he is reported (_Philosophical Transactions_, Vol. LXXII) to\r\nhave ascertained the existence of negative electricity in the vapour\r\nof water, in the smoke of burning coals, and in the gas produced by a\r\nsolution of iron in weak sulphuric acid. An account of the above named\r\nand of other discoveries, as well as of various experiments, appears in\r\nletters addressed by him to Prof. Don Bassiano Carminati, of the Pavia\r\nMedical University, April 3, 1792, and to Tiberius Cavallo, Sept. 13,\r\nand Oct. 25, 1792, as shown in the _Philosophical Transactions_ of the\r\nRoyal Society, which institution gave him its gold Copley medal.\r\n\r\nVolta’s crowning effort lies in the discovery of the development of\r\nelectricity in metallic bodies and in the production of the justly\r\nfamous pile which bears his name. The latter consisted of an equal\r\nnumber of zinc and copper discs separated by circular plates of\r\ncloth, paper or pasteboard soaked in salt-water or dilute acid, all\r\nbeing suitably connected to develop a large quantity of the electric\r\nfluid. Thus, says Dr. Dickerson in his address at Princeton College,\r\nVolta gave to the world that new manifestation of electricity called\r\nGalvanism. In that form this subtle agent is far more manageable than\r\nin the form of static electricity; and by the use of galvanic batteries\r\na current of low tension, but of enormously greater power, can be\r\nmaintained with little difficulty; whereas static electricity is like\r\nlightning, and readily leaps and escapes on the surfaces on which it is\r\nconfined.\r\n\r\n“It was Volta who removed our doubtful knowledge. Such knowledge is\r\nthe early morning light of every advancing science, and is essential to\r\nits development; but the man who is engaged in dispelling that which is\r\ndeceptive in it, and revealing more clearly that which is true, is as\r\nuseful in his place and as necessary to the general progress of science\r\nas he who first broke through the intellectual darkness and opened a\r\npath into knowledge before unknown” (Faraday’s “Researches”).\r\n\r\nThe last mentioned discovery, though made in 1796, was first announced\r\nonly on the 20th of March, 1800, in a letter written from Como to Sir\r\nJoseph Banks, by whom it was communicated to the Royal Society. It was\r\npublicly read June 26, 1800 (_Phil. Trans._ for 1800, Part II. p. 408).\r\n\r\nAt pp. 428–429 of “La Revue Scientifique,” Paris, April 8, 1905, will\r\nbe found a review of J. Bosscha’s work entitled “La correspondance\r\nde A. Volta et de M. Van Marum,” published at Leyden. Bosscha\r\ncalls especial attention to letters numbered XIII and XIV, dated\r\nrespectively August 30 and October 11, 1792, wherein Volta describes\r\nhis construction of the apparatus which, as already stated, was not\r\nmade known until March 20, 1800. M. Bosscha’s work is also referred to\r\nin the “Journal des Savants” for August 1905.\r\n\r\nVolta, at about the same period, constructed an electrical battery,\r\nwhich has been named _La Couronne de Tasses_ (the crown of cups),\r\nand which consisted of a number of cups arranged in a circle, each cup\r\ncontaining a saline liquid and supporting against its edges a strip\r\nof zinc and one of silver. As the upper part of each zinc strip was\r\nconnected by a wire with a strip of silver in the adjoining cup, the\r\nsilver strip of the first cup and the zinc strip of the last cup formed\r\nthe poles of the battery. It is said that twenty such combinations\r\ndecomposed water, and that thirty gave a distinct shock.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th, 18th and 20th of November 1800 (Brumaire an. IX), Volta,\r\nwho had obtained permission of the Italian Government to go to\r\nParis with his colleague Prof. Brugnatelli, delivered lectures and\r\nexperimented before the French National Institute (Sue, “Histoire\r\ndu Galvanisme,” Vol. II. p. 267). As a member of the latter body,\r\nBonaparte, the First Consul, who had attended the second lecture and\r\nwitnessed the electro-chemical decomposition of water, proposed that\r\na gold medal be stuck to commemorate Volta’s discovery, and that a\r\ncommission be formed to repeat all of Volta’s experiments upon a\r\nlarge scale. The commission embraced such prominent men as Laplace,\r\nCoulomb, Hallé, Monge, Fourcroy, Vauquelin, Pelletan, Charles, Brisson,\r\nSabathier, Guyton De Morveau and Biot. Biot, the chairman of the\r\ncommission, made a report December 11, 1800, which appears in Vol. V\r\nof the _Mémoires de l’Institut National de France_, as well as in\r\nthe _Annales de Chimie_, Vol. XLI. p. 3. In addition to the gold\r\nmedal, Volta received from Bonaparte the sum of six thousand francs and\r\nthe cross of the Legion of Honour.\r\n\r\nTo Volta has been attributed the fact of having, as early as 1777,\r\nentertained the idea of an electric telegraph, although nothing more\r\nappears to be on record in relation to the matter. Fahie quotes a\r\nletter of Sir Francis Ronalds, alluding to an autograph manuscript,\r\ndated Como, April 15, 1777, and gives its translation by César Cantu,\r\nwherein Volta states that he does not doubt the possibility of\r\nexploding his electrical pistol at Milan, through wires supported by\r\nposts, whenever he discharges a powerful Leyden jar at Como.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Arago, “Eloge Historique de Volta” and “Notices\r\n   Biographiques,” Tome I. p. 234 (“Raccolta Pratica di Scienze,”\r\n   etc. for March and April 1835); London _Times_ of January 26,\r\n   1860; the eulogies pronounced by Giorn.

The cause which led to his\r\nresignation is best given in the following extract from his biography\r\nin the English Cyclopedia:\r\n\r\n“During the year 1777 a dispute arose among the members of the Royal\r\nSociety relative to the form which should be given to electrical\r\nconductors so as to render them most efficacious in protecting\r\nbuildings from the destructive effects of lightning. Franklin had\r\npreviously recommended the use of points, and the propriety of this\r\nrecommendation had been acknowledged and sanctioned by the Society\r\nat large. But, after the breaking out of the American Revolution,\r\nFranklin was no longer regarded by many of the members in any other\r\nlight than an enemy of England, and, as such, it appears to have been\r\nrepugnant to their feelings to act otherwise than in disparagement\r\nof his scientific discoveries. Among this number was their patron\r\nGeorge III, who, according to a story current at the time, and of the\r\nsubstantial truth of which there is no doubt, on its being proposed to\r\nsubstitute knobs instead of points, requested that Sir John Pringle\r\nwould likewise advocate their introduction. The latter hinted that the\r\nlaws and operations of nature could not be reversed at royal pleasure;\r\nwhereupon it was intimated to him that a President of the Royal\r\nSociety entertaining such an opinion ought to resign, and he resigned\r\naccordingly.”\r\n\r\nIn Benjamin Franklin’s letter to Dr. Ingen-housz, dated Passy, Oct.\r\n14, 1777, occurs the following: “The King’s changing his _pointed_\r\nconductors for _blunt_ ones is therefore a matter of small importance\r\nto me. If I had a wish about it, it would be that he had rejected them\r\naltogether as ineffectual.” It was shortly after the occurrence above\r\nalluded to that the following epigram was written by a friend of Dr.\r\nFranklin:\r\n\r\n    “While you Great George, for knowledge hunt,\r\n    And sharp conductors change for blunt,\r\n          The nation’s out of joint:\r\n    Franklin a wiser course pursues,\r\n    And all your thunder useless views,\r\n          By keeping to the _point_.”\r\n\r\nThomson informs us (“Hist. Roy. Soc.” pp. 446–447) that the Board\r\nof Ordnance having consulted the Royal Society about the best mode\r\nof securing the powder magazine, at Purfleet, from the effects of\r\nlightning, the Society appointed Mr. Cavendish, Dr. Watson, Dr.\r\nFranklin, Mr. Robertson and Mr. Wilson a committee to examine the\r\nbuilding and report upon it. These gentlemen went accordingly, and\r\nthe first four recommended the erecting of pointed conductors in\r\nparticular parts of the building, as a means which they thought\r\nwould afford complete security. Mr. Wilson dissented from the other\r\ngentlemen, being of the opinion that the conductors ought not to be\r\npointed but blunt, because pointed conductors solicit and draw down\r\nthe lightning which might otherwise pass by. He published a long paper\r\non the subject, assigning a great variety of reasons for his preference\r\n(_Philosophical Transactions_, Vol. LXIII. p. 49). It was this\r\ndissent of Mr. Wilson which produced between the electricians of the\r\nRoyal Society a controversy respecting the comparative merits of\r\npointed and blunt conductors, which continued a number of years, and\r\na variety of papers in support of which made their appearance in the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_. The controversy, in fact, engaged\r\nalmost the exclusive attention of the writers on electricity for\r\nseveral successive volumes of that work.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--William Henley, “Experiments ... pointed and\r\n   blunted rods ...” in _Phil.

Noad, treating of the laws of magnetic force, says\r\n(“Electricity” p. 579) that Martin and Tobias Mayer both came to the\r\nconclusion that the true law of the magnetic force is identical with\r\nthat of gravitation, and that, in the previous experiments of Hauksbee\r\nand others, proper allowance had not been made for the disturbing\r\nchanges in the magnetic forces so inseparable from the nature of the\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nHis first Lecture explains all the phenomena of electricity and\r\nmagnetism, the appendix thereto detailing numerous experiments of\r\nMr. John Canton, and giving many additional facts concerning the\r\nmanufacture of artificial magnets. From his preface the following\r\nextracts will, doubtless, prove interesting: “We are arrived at great\r\ndexterity since Sir Isaac Newton’s time; for we can now almost prove\r\nthe existence of this _aether_ by the phenomena of electricity;\r\nand then we find it very easy to prove that electricity is nothing\r\nbut this very _aether_ condensed and made to shine. But I believe,\r\nwhen we inquire into the nature and properties of this _aether_ and\r\nelectricity, we shall find them so very different and dissimilar, that\r\nwe cannot easily conceive how they should thus mutually prove each\r\nother.... I see no cause to believe that the matter of electricity is\r\nanything like the idea we ought to have of the _spiritus subtilissimus_\r\nof Sir Isaac.... The smell also of _electrical fire_ is so very much\r\nlike that of _phosphorus_, that we may be easily induced to believe a\r\ngreat part of the composition of both is the same.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Encycl.

According to Lord Cavendish, the theory developed in the\r\nabove-named work is that “A positively electrified body surrounded\r\nby air will deposit upon all the particles of that air, which shall\r\ncome successively into contact with it, a proportional part of its\r\n_superabundant_ electricity. By which means, the _air_ surrounding the\r\nbody will also become _positively_ electrified; that is to say, it will\r\nform round that positive body an electrical atmosphere, which will\r\nlikewise be positive.... That the _Density_ of all such atmospheres\r\ndecreases when the distance from the charged body is increased.”\r\n\r\nTyndall says (Notes on Lecture VII) that Lord Mahon fused metals and\r\nproduced strong physiological effects by the return stroke.\r\n\r\nIn 1781, the English scientist, John Turberville Needham (1713–1781),\r\npublished at Brussels his French translation of Lord Mahon’s work under\r\nthe title of “Principes de l’Electricité.” Needham was the first of the\r\nCatholic clergy elected to a fellowship of the English Royal Society,\r\nto whose Transactions he made several contributions.

Dr. Priestley states that Ingen-housz and Ramsden invented it\r\nindependently of one another. He describes a circular plate of glass\r\nnine inches in diameter turning vertically and rubbing against four\r\ncushions, each an inch and a half long and placed at the opposite\r\nends of the vertical diameter. The conductor is a brass tube bearing\r\ntwo horizontal branches extending to within about half an inch of the\r\nextremity of the glass, so that each branch takes off the electricity\r\nexcited by two of the cushions (Dr. Thomas Young, “Course of Lectures,”\r\nVol. II. p. 432).\r\n\r\nThe plate machine of Dr. Ingen-housz is illustrated at p. 16 of\r\n“Electricity” in the “Library of Useful Knowledge.” For other plate\r\nmachines see, more particularly, Dr. Young’s “Course of Lectures,”\r\nVol. II. p. 431; _Phil.

Thouin and blooms for\r\nthe first time in the Botanic Gardens of Upsala, Sweden.\r\n\r\nIn the “Scientific American” of February 26, 1881, reference is made\r\nto the interesting account of this plant given by Sir J. D. Hooker\r\nin Curtis’ “Botanical Magazine,” as well as to the following extract\r\nfrom Prof. Asa Gray’s report concerning it: “The first announcement\r\nof the tendency of the leaves of the compass plant to direct their\r\nedges to the north and south was made by General (then Lieutenant)\r\nAlvord, of the U.S. Army, during the year 1842, and again in 1844, in\r\ncommunications to the American Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience.... The lines in “Evangeline” (familiar to many readers):\r\n\r\n    “Look at this delicate plant that lifts its head from the meadow,\r\n    See how its leaves all point to the north as true as the magnet;\r\n    It is the compass plant that the finger of God has suspended,\r\n    Here on its fragile stalk, to direct the traveller’s journey,\r\n    Over the sealike, pathless, limitless waste of the desert----”\r\n\r\nwere inspired through a personal communication made by General Alvord\r\nto the poet Longfellow.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, the following article, headed “A Wonderful Magnetic\r\nPlant,” translated from _La Nature_ by the London _Court Journal_, will\r\nprove interesting: “There has been discovered in the forests of India a\r\nstrange plant (_Philotacea electrica_) which possesses to a very high\r\ndegree astonishing magnetic power. The hand which breaks a leaf from\r\nit receives immediately a shock equal to that which is produced by the\r\nconductor of an induction coil. At a distance of six metres a magnetic\r\nneedle is affected by it, and it will be quite deranged if brought\r\nnear. The energy of this singular influence varies with the hours\r\nof the day. All powerful about two o’clock in the afternoon, it is\r\nabsolutely annulled during the night. At times of storm its intensity\r\naugments to striking proportions. While it rains the plant seems to\r\nsuccumb: it bends its head during a thunder-shower and remains without\r\nforce or virtue even if one should shelter it with an umbrella. No\r\nshock is felt at that time in breaking the leaves, and the needle is\r\nunaffected by it. One never by any chance sees a bird or insect alight\r\non this electric plant; an instinct seems to warn them that in so doing\r\nthey would find sudden death. It is also important to remark that where\r\nit grows none of the magnetic metals are found, neither iron, nor\r\ncobalt, nor nickel--an undeniable proof that the electric force belongs\r\nexclusively to the plant. Light and heat, phosphorescence, magnetism,\r\nelectricity, how many mysteries and botanical problems does this\r\nwondrous Indian plant conceal within its leaf and flower!”\r\n\r\nThe results of some interesting researches on plant-electricity have\r\nbeen reported by A. D. Waller, who finds that whenever a plant is\r\nwounded, a positive electric current is established between the wounded\r\npart and the intact parts. This may start with an electromotive force\r\nof 0·1 volt, but it afterward diminishes. He writes further:\r\n\r\n“Actual wounding is not necessary to obtain this manifestation; an\r\nelectro-positive current is set up when there is mechanical excitation,\r\nbut it is much weaker (0·02 volt). And light acts like mechanical\r\nexcitation with certain plants, such as the leaves of the iris, of\r\ntobacco, of the begonia, etc. From the illuminated to the darkened\r\npart flows a positive electric current that may be as strong as\r\n0·02 volt. A similar reaction in the petals is not always observed.\r\nThere is a certain correlation between the vigour of a plant and the\r\nelectric reaction. The more vigorous the plant is, the stronger the\r\ncurrent. Plants grown from fresh seeds give a more powerful current\r\nthan those from old seeds. A bean a year old gave a current of 0·0170\r\nvolt; one five years old, a current of 0·0014; and the reaction is\r\ninversely and regularly proportional to the age of the seed from\r\nwhich the plant springs. There is observed in vegetable tissues,\r\nsubjected to an excitation of the same intensity at regular intervals,\r\nthe characteristic changes of reaction that are present in animal\r\ntissues--fatigue, recuperation, etc. Temperature plays a part in all\r\nthese phenomena; below -4° to -6° C. [+° to + 25° F.] and above 40° C.\r\n[108° F.] there is no reaction.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1781.=--Lavoisier (Antoine Laurent), an eminent French natural\r\nphilosopher, the chief founder of modern chemistry as well as of\r\nthe prevailing system of chemical nomenclature which ended in the\r\nexpulsion of the phlogistic theory, demonstrates by experiments made in\r\nconjunction with Volta and Laplace that electricity is developed when\r\nsolid or fluid bodies pass into the gaseous state. Sir David Brewster\r\nsays that the bodies to be evaporated or dissolved were placed upon an\r\ninsulating stand and were made to communicate by a chain or wire with a\r\nCavallo electrometer, or with Volta’s condenser, when it was suspected\r\nthat the electricity increased gradually. When sulphuric acid, diluted\r\nwith three parts of water, was poured upon iron filings, inflammable\r\nair was disengaged with a brisk effervescence; and, at the end of a\r\nfew minutes, the condenser was so highly charged as to yield a strong\r\nspark of negative electricity. Similar results were obtained when\r\ncharcoal was burnt on a chafing dish, or when fixed air or nitrous gas\r\nwas generated from powdered chalk by means of the sulphuric and nitrous\r\nacids.\r\n\r\nThe phlogistic theory alluded to above, which was so named by George\r\nErnest Stahl in 1697 after Johann Joachim Beccher (1635–1682) had\r\npointed out its principle in 1669, had for its most energetic defender\r\nthe editor of the _Journal de Physique_, M. J. C. De La Méthérie,\r\nwho is entered at A.D. 1785, and it was in order to offset the\r\ninfluence which this gave him that the antiphlogistians established the\r\n_Annales de Chimie_, so frequently mentioned in these pages.[52]\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--George Adams’ “Lectures on Nat. and Exp.\r\n   Philosophy,” London, 1799, Vol. I. pp. 575–587, wherein\r\n   Lavoisier’s system is confuted by the German chemist Wieglib,\r\n   whose views are endorsed by Mr. Green, while for Stahl and\r\n   Beccher, refer to Sir H.

In\r\nthis, as has been truly said, are seen all the essential parts of the\r\nfrictional apparatus now in use.\r\n\r\nThis machine, according to Cuthbertson, was originally constructed\r\nin 1774, and was far more powerful than any before made. Nairne also\r\nconstructed the largest battery known up to that time. It contained 50\r\nsquare feet of coated surface, and it could be given so high a charge\r\nas to ignite 45 inches of iron wire ¹⁄₁₅₀ of an inch diameter, which up\r\nto that period was the greatest length of wire ever ignited. Nairne,\r\nwhile improving upon some of Priestley’s experiments, found that a\r\npiece of hard drawn iron wire, ten inches long and one-hundredth of an\r\ninch diameter, after receiving successively the discharge of 26 feet\r\nof coated glass (nine jars), was shortened three-fortieths of an inch\r\nby such discharge. Dr. Priestley had previously observed that a chain\r\n28 inches long was shortened one quarter of an inch after having had\r\ntransmitted through it a charge of 64 square feet of coated glass, and\r\nBrooke Taylor found that by passing a charge of nine bottles of 16\r\nfeet of coated surface nine times in succession through a steel wire\r\n12 inches long and one one-hundredth of an inch diameter, the wire was\r\nshortened one and one-half inches, or one-eighth its entire length.\r\n\r\nTo Nairne was granted the third English patent in the Class of\r\nElectricity and Magnetism, the first having been issued to Gowin\r\nKnight in 1766 (see A.D. 1746) and the second to Gabriel Wright, June\r\n25, 1779, for “a new constructed azimuth and amplitude compass.” Knight\r\nsubsequently covered other similar inventions, July 5, 1791, and Jan.\r\n19, 1796. Nairne’s patent bears date Feb. 5, 1782, No. 1318, and is\r\nfor what he calls “The Insulated Medical Electrical Machine,” the\r\nconductors of which are so arranged as to readily give either shocks or\r\nsparks. He says that “by means of the conductors and jointed tubes, the\r\nhuman body can be in any part affected with either kind of electricity\r\nin any convenient manner.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Philosophical Transactions_ for 1772, 1774,\r\n   1778, 1780, 1783, Vol. LXIV. p. 79; Vol. LXVIII. p. 823; Vol.\r\n   LXX. p. 334; also Hutton’s abridgments, Vol. XIII. pp. 360\r\n   (dipping needle), 498; Vol. XIV. pp. 427–446, 688; Vol. XV.\r\n   p. 388; “General Biog.

C. Borda (at A.D. 1776). For accounts of\r\nthe _secular_ and _annual_, as well as of the _diurnal_ and _horary_\r\nvariations of the dip, the reader should consult the First Section of\r\nHumboldt’s “Cosmos” treating of telluric phenomena and some of the very\r\nnumerous references therein given.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the influence of the sun’s position upon the manifestation\r\nof the magnetic force of the earth, Humboldt remarks that the most\r\ndistinct intimation of this relation was afforded by the discovery\r\nof _horary_ variations, although it had been obscurely perceived by\r\nKepler, who surmised that all the axes of the planets were magnetically\r\ndirected toward one portion of the universe. He says that the sun may\r\nbe a magnetic body, and that on that account the force which impels\r\nthe planets may be centred in the sun (Kepler, in “Stella Martis,”\r\npp. 32–34--compare with it his treatise, “Mysterium Cosmogr.,” cap.\r\n20, p. 71). He further observes that the _horary_ variations of the\r\ndeclination, which, although dependent upon true time are apparently\r\ngoverned by the sun as long as it remains above the horizon, diminish\r\nin angular value with the magnetic latitude of place. Near the equator,\r\nfor instance, in the island of Rawak, they scarcely amount to three\r\nor four minutes, whilst the variations are from thirteen to fourteen\r\nminutes in the middle of Europe. As in the whole northern hemisphere\r\nthe north point of the needle moves from east to west on an average\r\nfrom 8½ in the morning until 1½ at midday, in the southern hemisphere\r\nthe same north point moves from west to east (Arago, _Annuaire_,\r\n1836, p. 284, and 1840, pp. 330–358). Attention has been drawn, with\r\nmuch justice, to the fact that there must be a region of the earth,\r\nbetween the terrestrial and the magnetic equator, where no horary\r\ndeviations in the declination are to be observed. This fourth curve\r\n(in contradistinction to the _isodynamic_, _isoclinic_ and _isogonic_\r\nlines, or those respectively of equal force, equal inclination and\r\nequal declination), which might be called the _curve of no motion_, or\r\nrather _the line of no variation of horary declination_, has not yet\r\nbeen discovered. No point has hitherto been found at which the needle\r\ndoes not exhibit a _horary_ motion, and, since the erection of magnetic\r\nstations, the important and very unexpected fact has been evolved that\r\nthere are places in the southern magnetic hemisphere at which the\r\n_horary_ variations of the dipping needle alternately participate in\r\nthe phenomena (types) of the hemispheres.\r\n\r\nHumboldt also alludes, in the article on “Magnetic Variation,” to his\r\nrecognition of the “four motions of the needle, constituting, as it\r\nwere, four periods of magnetic ebbing and flowing, analogous to the\r\nbarometrical periods,” which will be found recorded in Hansteen’s\r\n“Magnetismus der Erde,” 1819, s. 459, and he likewise refers to the\r\nlong-disregarded _nocturnal_ alterations of variation, for which\r\nhe calls attention to Faraday “On the Night Episode,” ss. 3012–3024.\r\n(See also, Poggendorff’s _Annalen der Physik_, Bd. XV. s. 330, and\r\nBd. XIX. s. 373.)\r\n\r\nThe _Phil. Trans._ for 1738, p. 395, contain the description of a new\r\ncompass for ascertaining the variation “with greater ease and exactness\r\nthan any ever yet contrived for that purpose.” This was devised by\r\nCapt. Christopher Middleton, whose many interesting observations are\r\nto be found in the same volume of the _Phil.

Partly with the assistance of his learned nephew, James Philip\r\nMaraldi, Cassini made many important discoveries, among which may be\r\nsignalled the finding of the first, second, third and fifth satellites\r\nof Saturn, as well as the dual character of that planet’s ring, the\r\ndetermination of the rotation of Jupiter, Mars and Venus, and the laws\r\nof the moon’s axial rotation. (See Thomson, “Hist. of the Roy. Soc.,”\r\np. 331; “Anc. Mém. de Paris,” I, VIII, X; Thos. Morrell, “Elem. of the\r\nHist. of Phil. and Sc.,” London, 1827, pp. 377–379.)\r\n\r\nJacques (James) Cassini (1677–1756), the only son of the preceding,\r\nbecame director of the Paris Observatory upon the death of his father,\r\nmade many very important astronomical observations, and wrote several\r\ntreatises upon electricity, etc. In one of his works, “De la Grandeur\r\net de la Figure de la Terre,” Paris, 1720, he gives an account of the\r\ncontinuation of the measurement of Picard’s arc of the meridian from\r\nParis northward, begun by Domenico Cassini and La Hire in 1680, and\r\nrecommenced by Domenico and Jacques Cassini in 1700. (See “Mém. de\r\nParis,” Vol. VII. pp. 455, 456, 508, 572; and for years 1705, pp. 8,\r\n80; 1708, pp. 173, 292; 1729, Hist. I., Mem. 321.)\r\n\r\nCesar François Cassini de Thury (1714–1784), son of Jacques, whom he\r\nin turn succeeded at the Observatory, was, as above stated, the father\r\nof Jean Dominique Cassini (1747–1845). He made numerous researches\r\nwhile in the Director’s Chair, his most remarkable work being the large\r\ntriangulation of France published in 1744, under the title of “La\r\nMéridienne,” etc. (See “Hist. de l’Acad. des Sciences de Paris” pour\r\n1752, p. 10.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1783.=--Robespierre (François-Maximilien-Joseph-Isidore de),\r\nwho afterward became leader of the famous French Jacobin Club, and was\r\nat the time practising law in his native town of Arras, distinguishes\r\nhimself by successfully defending the cause of the Sieur de Vissery\r\nde Boisvalé, a landed proprietor of that place, who had erected a\r\nlightning conductor on his house, “much to the scandal of the discreet\r\ncitizens” of the locality--“Deistical philosophy; away with it!”\r\n(Eighth “Britannica,” Vol. XIX. p. 233).\r\n\r\nMr. de Boisvalé’s case was an appeal from a judgment delivered by\r\nthe sheriff of Saint-Omer, ordering the destruction of the lightning\r\nconductor, and its printed report bears the following epigraph:\r\n\r\n    “L’usage appuyé sur les temps\r\n    Et les préjugés indociles.\r\n    Ne se retire qu’à pas lents\r\n    Devant les vérités utiles.”\r\n\r\nJean Paul Marat, docteur en médecine et médecin des Gardes de corps de\r\nM. le Comte d’Artois, who, like Robespierre, was a member of the French\r\nNational Convention as well as a declared enemy of the Girondins,\r\nand who was killed by Charlotte Corday, July 13, 1793, made many\r\nelectrical experiments. These greatly interested Benjamin Franklin,\r\nwho used to visit him (Ninth “Encycl. Brit.,” Vol. XV. p. 526). He\r\nwas the author of many electrical works during the years 1779–1784,\r\nnotably “Découvertes sur le feu, l’électricité et la lumière,”\r\n“Recherches Physiques,” and a memoir on medical electricity (“Œuvres de\r\nMarat,” Paris, 1788; A.

H.), Scotch physician, publishes at\r\nEdinburgh his “Tentamen Philosophico-medicum de Electricitate,” which\r\nis followed, during 1798 and 1799, by other works upon electricity,\r\nwherein he cites a number of marvellous cures of intermittent fevers\r\nsimilar to those made by Cavallo, also of amaurosis (_goutte sereine_)\r\nand of quinsy (_squinancie_) like those performed by Lovet, Becket and\r\nMauduyt.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1804 appeared the first edition, in two volumes, of\r\nhis “Elements of Galvanism in Theory and Practice,” containing a very\r\ncomprehensive review of the discovery from the time of Galvani’s early\r\nexperiments. In this last-named work, however, he shows that incipient\r\namaurosis and the completely formed gutta serena have not yielded to\r\nhis own treatment by galvanic influence as had been the case with Dr.\r\nC. J. C. Grapengieser, who published many accounts of surprising cures\r\n(Grapengieser, “Versuche den Galvanismus ...” Berlin, 1801 and 1802,\r\nor Brewer and Delaroche, “Essai ...” Paris, 1802). The whole of Chap.\r\nXXXVI is devoted to the application of galvanism to medicine, whereto\r\nallusion had already been made in the first chapter of the same work.\r\n\r\nWilkinson refers also to the electricity of the _torpedo_, and to the\r\nobservations made thereon by Hippocrates, Plato, Theophrastus, Pliny\r\nand Ælian, also by Belon, Rondelet, Salviana and Gesner, as well as by\r\nMusschenbroek, Redi, Réaumur, Walsh, Hunter, Spallanzani, ’Sgravesande,\r\nSteno, Borelli, Galvani and others. Much space is likewise given to the\r\nobservations recorded on animal electricity, notably by Fontana, De La\r\nMéthérie, Berlinghieri, Vassali-Eandi, Humboldt, Pfaff, Lehot, Hallé,\r\nAldini, and to the experiments of Valli as they were repeated before\r\nthe French Academy of Sciences and before the Royal Society of Medicine\r\nof Paris, in presence of M. Mauduyt. When treating of the powers of\r\ngalvanism as a chemical agent, reference is made to the decomposition\r\nof water, thus first effected in 1795 by Creve, the discoverer of\r\nmetallic irritation, and to the operations of Nicholson and Carlisle,\r\nDr. Henry, Cruikshanks, Haldane, Henry Moyes, Richter, Gibbes, etc.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--J.

In\r\ncontradistinction, Mr. T. Ronayne found in Ireland that the electricity\r\nof the atmosphere is positive in winter when the air is clear, but that\r\nit diminishes in frosty or foggy weather and that he could detect no\r\nelectricity in the air during summer except on the approach of fogs,\r\nwhen the electricity proved to be positive. During the year 1785, M.\r\nde Saussure observed at Geneva that, during the winter, the intensity\r\nof atmospherical electricity attained its first maximum at 9 a.m.,\r\ndiminishing from that hour until it reached its minimum at 6 p.m.,\r\nafter which it began to increase until attaining its second maximum\r\nat 8 p.m., diminishing gradually thereafter till it recorded its\r\nsecond minimum at 6 a.m. During the summer he found the electricity\r\nincreasing from sunrise till between 3 and 4 p.m., when it would reach\r\nits maximum; after that it appeared to diminish till the dew fell, when\r\nit again became stronger, but was scarcely sensible during the night.\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster informs us in his able article on “Electricity”\r\nin the “Britannica” that De Saussure made a number of elaborate\r\nexperiments on the electricity of evaporation and combustion. He\r\nobserved at first that the electricity was sometimes positive and\r\nsometimes negative when water was evaporated from a heated crucible,\r\nbut in his subsequent trials he found it to be always positive in\r\nan iron and in a copper crucible. In a silver, also in a porcelain\r\ncrucible, the electricity was negative and the evaporation of\r\nboth alcohol and of ether in a silver crucible also gave negative\r\nelectricity. M. de Saussure made many fruitless attempts to obtain\r\nelectricity from combustion, and he likewise failed in his efforts to\r\nprocure it from evaporation without ebullition.\r\n\r\nTo De Saussure is often erroneously attributed the authorship of\r\nLullin’s “Dissertatio physica de electricitate,” alluded to at\r\nA.D. 1766.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--De Saussure’s “Dissertatio de Igne,” “Exposition\r\n   abrégée,” etc. (translated by Giuseppe Toaldo, in both his\r\n   “Della maniera,” etc., and “Dei conduttori,” etc., Venezia, 1772\r\n   and 1778), “Voyage dans les Alpes,” all published at Geneva,\r\n   1759, 1771, 1779, also the important 1786 Neuchatel edition of\r\n   the last-named work, more particularly at pp. 194, 197, 203,\r\n   205, 206, 211, 212, 216, 218, 219, 228, 252, 254 of Vol. II, and\r\n   at pp. 197, 257 of Vol. IV; likewise his Memoirs relative to the\r\n   electricity of the atmosphere, of vegetables, of microscopic\r\n   animals, etc., etc., alluded to in _Journal de Physique_ for\r\n   1773, 1784, 1788; in _Journal de Paris_ for 1784, 1785; in Vol.\r\n   I of Lazaro Spallanzani’s “Opuscoli di fisica,” etc., for 1776;\r\n   in Vol. III of the “Opuscoli Scelti di Milano,” and in the\r\n   _Philosophical Transactions_.

Phil.”). The latter contains all the essays sent\r\nto the Electoral Academy of Bavaria on the subject--“Is There a Real\r\nand Physical Analogy Between Electric and Magnetic Forces; and, if Such\r\nAnalogy Exist, in What Manner Do These Forces Act Upon the Animal Body?”\r\n\r\nVan Swinden’s essay, which gained him one of the prizes, shows that,\r\nin his opinion, the similarity between electricity and magnetism\r\namounts merely to an apparent resemblance, and does not constitute a\r\nreal physical analogy. He infers from this that these two powers are\r\nessentially different and distinct from one another, but the contrary\r\nopinion was maintained by Profs. Steiglehuer and Hubner, who contended\r\nthat so close an analogy as that exhibited by these two classes of\r\nphenomena indicated the effects of a single agent, varied only in\r\nconsequence of a diversity of circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe eminent professor, Gerard Moll, of Utrecht, has communicated to the\r\nEdinburgh _Journal of Science_ (1826, Vol. I. part ii. pp. 197–208)\r\na biographical notice of Van Swinden, wherein he gives a list of the\r\nlatter’s principal works and there speaks of one of his best-known\r\nproductions in following manner: “The _Positiones Physicæ_ (Opusc.\r\nScelti, X. 7), as far as they are published (Harderovici, 1786, Vol.\r\nI and Vol. II. part i.), are allowed to rank among the best elements\r\nof natural philosophy, and have been found by actual experience to\r\nbelong to the best sources from which the young student could draw\r\nhis information on those parts of natural philosophy, and its general\r\nprinciples, as are contained in the first volume and part of the\r\nsecond, which is all that was published. The work itself is on a most\r\nextensive plan; and the multifarious avocations which crowded on Van\r\nSwinden in Amsterdam delayed the publications, and made him afterward\r\nabandon all thoughts of completing a work which would have done the\r\ngreatest honour to its author, and which even now, unfinished as it is,\r\nis celebrated as an excellent specimen of sound reasoning and profound\r\nlearning.”\r\n\r\nVan Swinden was the first President of the Royal Institute of the\r\nNetherlands. He entered with ardour into all the new discoveries of\r\nhis day and kept up an extensive correspondence with many of the\r\nleading scientific characters of the time, notably with the Swiss\r\nphilosopher, Charles Bonnet (whose “Contemplations de la Nature” he\r\nannotated extensively); with Dr. Matthew Maty (who became secretary\r\nof the Royal Society upon the resignation of Dr. Birch in 1765, and\r\nwho was appointed, by the king, principal librarian of the British\r\nMuseum upon the death of Dr. Gowin Knight, 1772); with the eminent\r\nFrench physician, Michel-Augustin Thouret, Dean of the Paris “Faculté\r\nde Médecine”; as well as with Delambre, Euler, De Saussure, and many\r\nothers who have been named elsewhere in this “Bibliographical History.”\r\n\r\nThe following is further extracted from Prof. Moll’s interesting\r\npaper: “Mr. Biot, in his treatise on Natural Philosophy (Tome III. p.\r\n143) asserts that we are indebted to Cassini IV. (see Jean Dominique,\r\nComte de Cassini, at A.D. 1782–1791) for much of what we know even\r\nabout the diurnal variation of the needle. This, I think, is not fair.\r\nWe do not mean to undervalue Mr. Cassini’s observations, but it is\r\nunquestionable that long before the publication of that philosopher’s\r\nwork, Mr. Van Swinden had observed and published (‘Recherches sur\r\nles aiguilles aimantées et leurs variations’--Mémoires présentés à\r\nl’Académie des Sciences de Paris, Tome VIII--prize essay 1777) that\r\nwhich Mr. Biot less accurately is pleased to ascribe to his countryman.\r\nIn this respect, however, Mr. Van Swinden was treated with more justice\r\nby other eminent philosophers, such as Haüy, Halley and Burkhardt.”\r\n(Consult also the “Acta Acad. Petrop.” for 1780, Part I. Hist. p. 10.)\r\n\r\nIn the afore-named very meritorious work, “Recueil de Mémoires,”\r\netc., crowned by the Bavarian Academy, Van Swinden has treated fully\r\nof the then current theories relative to electrical and magnetical\r\nphenomena, reviewing the entire field of their application. In so\r\ndoing he has necessarily made numerous references to discoverers and\r\nexperimenters of all countries, the names of many of which appear in\r\nthe present compilation, and while it is, of course, useless here to\r\nquote these anew, it has been thought best, for a record, to specify\r\nsuch as are infrequently met with, and which appear in many of his most\r\nimportant articles, even at the risk of being accused of diffuseness or\r\nprolixity.

Vivenzio under date October 2, 1784: “The\r\nobservation which I mentioned some days ago, when we were discoursing\r\ntogether of the electrical animals, upon which I said I believed the\r\nmouse to be one of that number, is the following: Toward the latter end\r\nof March, I was sitting with a table before me and observing something\r\nto move about my foot, which drew my attention. Looking toward the\r\nfloor I saw a small domestic mouse, which, as its coat indicated,\r\nmust have been very young. As the little animal could not move very\r\nquick, I easily laid hold of it by the skin of the back and turned it\r\nupside down; then with a small knife that laid by me, I intended to\r\ndissect it. When I first made the incision into the epigastric region,\r\nthe mouse was situated between the thumb and finger of my left hand,\r\nand its tail was got between the last two fingers. I had hardly cut\r\nthrough part of the skin of that region, when the mouse vibrated its\r\ntail between the fingers, and was so violently agitated against the\r\nthird finger that, to my great astonishment, I felt a shock through\r\nmy left arm as far as the neck, attended with an internal tremor, a\r\npainful sensation in the muscles of the arm, and such giddiness of the\r\nhead, that, being affrighted, I dropped the mouse. The stupor of the\r\narm lasted upward of a quarter of an hour, nor could I afterwards think\r\nof the incident without emotion. I had no idea that such an animal was\r\nelectrical; but in this I had the positive proof of experience.” (See\r\nG. Vivenzio, “Teoria e pratica della elettricità med.” ... Napoli,\r\n1784.)\r\n\r\nCotugno’s observations attracted much attention throughout Italy and\r\ngave rise to many experiments, notably by Vassalli, who, however,\r\nmerely concluded from them that the animal’s body could retain\r\naccumulated electricity in some unaccountable manner.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Essai sur l’histoire_, etc., J.

Some\r\nhave asserted that Lord Stanhope had previously established the law\r\nwith regard to electricity, but it has not been seriously questioned\r\nthat its extension to magnetism belongs exclusively to Coulomb.\r\nJohann Lamont (“Handbuch ...” p. 427) gives the credit of the latter\r\ndiscovery to Giovannantonio Della Bella, of Padua, who is mentioned\r\nby Poggendorff (“Biog.-Liter. Handwörterbuch,” Vol. I. p. 139) as the\r\nauthor of several works on electricity and magnetism, but the claim\r\ndoes not appear to be established upon any satisfactory foundation.\r\n\r\nWith his torsion balance, or rather electrometer, Coulomb measured\r\nthe force by the amount of twist it gave to a long silken thread\r\ncarrying a horizontal needle, constructed, preferably, of a filament\r\nof gum-lac or of straw covered with sealing-wax. From his experiments\r\nhe concluded: That the attractive force of two small globes, one\r\nelectrified positively and the other negatively, is in the inverse\r\nratio of the squares of the distances of their centres, and that the\r\nrepulsive force of two small globes, charged either with positive or\r\nnegative electricity, is inversely as the squares of the distances of\r\nthe centres of the globes (“Mém. de l’Acad. Roy. des Sciences,” 1784,\r\n1785).\r\n\r\nIn one of his three memoirs to the French Academy during 1785, he\r\nstates that a balance used by him was so delicate that each degree of\r\nthe circle of torsion expressed a force of only one hundred-thousandth\r\nof an English grain, that another, suspended by a single fibre of\r\nsilk four inches long, made a complete revolution with a force of one\r\nseventy-thousandth of a grain, and turned to the extent of a right\r\nangle when a stick of sealing-wax, which had been rubbed, was presented\r\nto it at the distance of a yard. It is said that a similar electrometer\r\nhas been constructed in which the movement of one degree recorded a\r\nforce not exceeding twenty-one million six-hundred-thousandths of a\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nThe many valuable experiments made by Coulomb on the dissipation of\r\nelectricity and upon the distribution of electricity upon the surfaces\r\nof bodies are fully recorded in the able article of Sir David Brewster\r\nin the “Encyclopædia Britannica” (F. C. Achard, “Mém. de Berlin,”\r\n1780, p. 47); M. Vernier, “De la dist. ... conducteurs,” Paris,\r\n1824; J. L. F. Bertrand, “Programme d’une thèse ...” Paris, 1839; D.\r\nBourdonnay, “Sur la dist. ... conducteurs,” Paris, 1840; Ed. A. Roche\r\nin “Montp. Acad. Sect. Sciences,” Vol. II. p. 115).\r\n\r\nHe discovered that shellac is the most perfect of all insulators, also\r\nthat a thread of gum-lac insulates ten times better than a dry silken\r\nthread of the same length and diameter: and he established the law that\r\nthe densities of electricity insulated by different lengths of fine\r\ncylindrical fibres, such as those of gum-lac, hair, silk, etc., vary as\r\nthe square root of the lengths of the fibre.\r\n\r\nBesides the communications above alluded to, Coulomb sent to the French\r\nAcademy, during the years 1786, 1787, 1788 and 1789, many papers upon\r\nElectricity and Magnetism, and, up to within two years of his death\r\n(1806), he made many notable experiments, especially in magnetism, of\r\nwhich full accounts are given in several of the Mémoires noted at foot.\r\nThe theory of the two magnetic fluids appeared in his 1789 paper. It is\r\nalso in this same paper that Coulomb describes his improved method of\r\nmaking artificial magnets by employing compound magnets as first made\r\nuse of by Gowin Knight and as explained at A.D. 1746. Still further\r\nimprovements in these were brought about more particularly by the young\r\nFlemish scientist, Etienne Jean Van Geuns (1767–1795), by Jean Baptiste\r\nBiot (see A.D. 1803), and by the Rev. Dr. Scoresby during the year 1836.\r\n\r\nCoulomb found that a steel wire is, by twisting, rendered capable of\r\nbeing nine times more strongly magnetized; that the magnetic power\r\ndwells on the surface of iron bodies and is independent of their mass;\r\nthat the directive force of a magnetized bar reached its maximum\r\nwhen tempered to a bright cherry-red heat at 900 degrees, and that\r\nevery substance is susceptible of magnetism to a degree of actual\r\nmeasurement. This last important research was communicated by him to\r\nthe French Institute during the year 1802. His experiments proved\r\nthat a grain of iron could communicate sensible magnetism to twenty\r\npounds’ weight of another substance, and that when even beeswax had\r\nincorporated with it a portion of iron filings equal only to the one\r\nhundred-and-thirty-thousandth part of its weight it was yet sensibly\r\naffected by the magnet.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Thomas Young, Coulomb’s improvements in the theory of\r\nelectricity may be considered as having immediately prepared the way\r\nfor the elegant inventions of Volta and for the still more marvellous\r\ndiscoveries of Davy. Dr. Young gives reports of some of Coulomb’s\r\nexperiments at p. 439, Vol. II of his “Course of Lectures” London,\r\n1807 (“Journal of the Royal Institution” Vol. I. p. 134; “Décade\r\nPhilosophique,” No. 21).\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Mém. de l’Acad.

According to Cavallo (_Nat. Phil._, 1825, Vol. II.\r\np. 194) it consisted of two circular plates of French glass, each\r\nsixty-five inches in diameter, parallel with each other on a common\r\naxis, and about seven and a half inches apart. Each plate was excited\r\nby four rubbers, the prime conductor being divided into two branches\r\nwhich entered between the plates and, by means of points, collected the\r\nelectric fluid from their inner surfaces only.\r\n\r\nIn Van Marum’s machine, the positive and negative electricity could\r\nonly be obtained in succession, but Dr. Hare, of the University\r\nof Pennsylvania, remedied this by causing the plates to revolve\r\nhorizontally. It is said the machine was so powerful that bodies at a\r\ndistance of forty feet were sensibly affected; a single spark from it\r\nmelted a leaf of gold and fired various kinds of combustibles; a thread\r\nbecame attracted at the distance of thirty-eight feet, and a pointed\r\nwire was tipped with a star of light at a distance of twenty-eight feet\r\nfrom the conductor.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of his machines are given by Dr. Van Marum in letters\r\nto the Chevalier Marsiglio Landriani and to Dr. Ingen-housz, both\r\nprinted in Haarlem during 1789 and 1791. The first quarto volume of\r\n_Nicholson’s Journal_ also contains a reference thereto and gives (p.\r\n83) the extract from a letter read June 24, 1773 (_Phil. Trans._, Vol.\r\nLXIII. pp. 333–339), addressed to Dr. Franklin, F.R.S., by John Merwin\r\nNooth, M.D., who describes improvements by which machines are rendered\r\neffective in all kinds of weather. Nooth was the inventor of the silk\r\nflap, of which mention was made in the description of Cavallo’s machine\r\n(under A.D. 1775).\r\n\r\nVan Marum also constructed a powerful battery, the metallic coatings of\r\nwhich were equal to 225 square feet, enabling him to give polarity to\r\nsteel bars nine inches long, nearly half an inch wide and one-twelfth\r\nof an inch thick, as well as to sever a piece of boxwood four inches\r\ndiameter and four inches long, and to melt three hundred inches of iron\r\nwire one hundred-and-fiftieth of an inch in diameter, or ten inches\r\nof one-fortieth of an inch in diameter. It is said that, during these\r\nexperiments, the report was so loud as to stun the ears, and the flash\r\nso bright as to dazzle the sight.\r\n\r\nDr. Van Marum likewise made experiments upon the electricity developed\r\nduring the melting and cooling of resinous bodies, which are detailed\r\nin the article “Electricity” 8th Edit. “Encyclopædia Britannica,” Vol.\r\nVIII. p. 565, and also upon the effects of electricity on animals and\r\nvegetables, which are given at pp. 49–51 of the article “Electricity”\r\nin the “Library of Useful Knowledge,” as well as in the 1855 Edit.\r\n“Encyclopædia Britannica,” Vol. VIII. pp. 602, 603.\r\n\r\nIn 1785 again Van Marum discovered that electric sparks, on passing\r\nthrough oxygen gas, gave rise to a peculiar sulphurous or electrical\r\nodour, which Cavallo called “electrified air,” and the presence of\r\nwhich Dr. John Davy, brother of Sir Humphry Davy, found the means of\r\ndetecting.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of October 1801 Volta wrote a letter to Van Marum\r\nasking him to make, in concert with Prof. C. H. Pfaff, of Kiel, several\r\nexperiments on the electricity of the pile with the very powerful\r\napparatus of the Teylerian Society. The extended researches of these\r\ntwo scientists are embodied in the _Phil. Mag._, Vol. XII. p. 161,\r\nas well as in the “Lettre à Volta” etc., published at Haarlem during\r\n1802, and are likewise treated of in a very complete manner throughout\r\nChaps. XVI and XXXII of Wilkinson’s well-known work on galvanism. Their\r\nunited observations confirm the doctrine of Volta as to the identity of\r\nthe current of the fluid put in motion by the voltaic pile and that to\r\nwhich an impulsion is given by an electrical machine. Thus is answered\r\nthe question asked during May 1801 by the Haarlem Society of Sciences,\r\nviz. “Can the voltaic pile be explained in a satisfactory manner by\r\nthe known laws and properties of electricity; or is it necessary to\r\nconclude the existence of a particular fluid, distinct from the one\r\nwhich is denominated electrical?” They also demonstrated that the\r\ncurrent put in motion by the voltaic pile has an enormous celerity\r\n“which surpasses all that the imagination can conceive.” With a pile\r\nof one hundred and ten pairs of very large copper and zinc plates,\r\nthey made experiments on the fusion of iron wires and ascertained the\r\ncauses of the more considerable effects of large piles in the fusion\r\nand oxidation of metals, proving, among other facts, as Biot and\r\nCuvier had already done, that a part of the oxygen is absorbed whether\r\nthe operation be carried on in the open air or _in vacuo_ (Biot\r\nand Cuvier, _Soc. Philomathique_, An. IX. p. 40; _Annales de\r\nChimie_, Vol. XXXIX. p. 247).\r\n\r\nAnother of Van Marum’s experiments is related in a letter to M.\r\nBerthollet, wherein he says: “... I have succeeded in the decomposition\r\nof water, by means of the current of the electrical machine, provided\r\nwith a plate of thirty-one inches diameter, constructed by me on a\r\nnew plan (see the _Journal de Physique_ for June, 1795).... I\r\ntook a thermometrical tube, of the kind employed in making the most\r\nsensitive thermometers of Crawford and Hunter, for which purpose I\r\nhad procured several of these tubes some time before in London. Its\r\ndiameter interiorly was not more than the one-hundredth part of an\r\ninch; and I introduced into it an iron wire of the diameter of about\r\nthe three-hundredth part of an inch, to the depth of about twelve\r\ninches. I now closed the end of my thermometrical tube with sealing\r\nwax in such a way that the extremity of the iron wire should scarcely\r\nproject, and I placed the tube itself, by means of a cork, within a\r\nlarger tube containing water. The rest of the apparatus was arranged\r\nin the customary manner. By directing the powerful current of the\r\nabove-mentioned machine to this apparatus, the copper ball belonging to\r\nwhich, placed on the thermometrical tube, was at the distance of about\r\nthree or four lines from the conductor, I succeeded in decomposing the\r\nwater with a promptitude nearly equal to that which results from a\r\nvoltaic pile of a hundred pairs of metallic plates.” This method of\r\ndecomposing water is a very tedious one, and is in fact the result of\r\nan interrupted explosion, while the process of Dr. Wollaston (alluded\r\nto at A.D. 1801) is tranquil and progressive.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Biogr.

The spark shown within an ivory ball, an orange, an\r\napple, or under the thumb, illuminates these bodies throughout. A lemon\r\nis especially suited to this experiment, flashing forth, at every\r\nspark, as a spheroid of very brilliant golden light, and a row of eggs\r\nis also brilliantly illuminated throughout, at the passage of every\r\nspark from a Leyden jar. Morgan likewise made several experiments to\r\nascertain the influence of electricity on the animal functions.

His “Lectures on Electricity” appeared\r\nin Norwich during the year 1794. In the second volume he describes (pp.\r\n225–236) “the form, noise, colours and devastation of the electric\r\nflash,” and treats (pp. 383–397) of the “relation of the electric\r\nfluid to vegetation,” alluding more particularly to the experiments\r\nof Maimbray, Nollet, Achard, Duvernier, Ingen-housz, Van Breda, Dr.\r\nCarmoy and the Abbé d’Ormoy.

The manuscript giving the result of\r\nhis experiments upon the Electricity of Metals is dated Sept. 20, 1786.\r\n\r\nFrom papers in the “Bolognese Transactions” noted below, it would\r\nappear that he had, even before the year 1780, made many observations\r\non the muscular contraction of frogs by electrical agency. Upon\r\none occasion his wife happened to be holding a scalpel against the\r\ndissected legs and parts of the spine of a frog, which lay in close\r\nproximity to the conductor of an electrical machine recently charged\r\nby one of Galvani’s pupils. She noticed that whenever the dissecting\r\nknife touched the muscles they were violently convulsed, and, upon\r\ncommunicating the fact to her husband, he repeated and extended the\r\nexperiment and found it necessary to pass the electric fluid through a\r\nmetallic substance in order to develop the result originally observed.\r\nAt first the frogs had been hung upon a copper hook fastened to an\r\niron railing, but he afterward substituted an arc composed of both\r\nmetals and with which he could readily produce the same results as were\r\nobtainable with an electrical machine.\r\n\r\nGalvani also made experiments to ascertain the effect of atmospheric\r\nelectricity upon the nerves of frogs. He connected the latter with rods\r\nleading to lightning conductors erected upon the roof of his house,\r\nattaching also ground wires to the legs of the animals, and found that\r\nthe same convulsions appeared whenever lightning was seen and likewise\r\nwhen heavy storm clouds passed over the house.\r\n\r\nThe results of his many interesting observations were first\r\nmade public in the celebrated work entitled “Aloysii Galvani de\r\nviribus electricitatis in motu musculari. Commentarius: cum Aldini\r\ndissertatione et notis,” which appeared during 1791–1792. Therein, he\r\nexpresses the belief that the bodies of animals possess a peculiar\r\nkind of electricity by which motion is communicated through both nerve\r\nand muscle, positive electricity going to the nerve, while negative\r\nelectricity goes to the muscle, and that the muscles represent the\r\nexterior and the nerves the interior of the Leyden jar, the discharge\r\nbeing similarly produced by the metal which communicates with both.\r\n\r\nGalvani’s singular experiments naturally attracted everywhere the\r\nattention of philosophers, by whom they were repeated and varied,\r\nbut by none were they more assiduously prosecuted than by Volta, who\r\nwas then a Professor at the Pavia University, and who, as already\r\nindicated, was led by them to the discovery of the voltaic pile and of\r\nvoltaic or galvanic electricity.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of Galvani’s observations was made in Germany,\r\nnotably by J. F. Ackermann (“Medicinisch-chirurgische Zeitung”), by\r\nM. Er (“Physiologische Darstellung der Lebenskräfte”), by M. Smuck\r\n(“Beiträge zur weiteren Kenntniss,” etc.), and by F. A. C. Gren\r\n(“Journal der Physik,” Vols. VI, VII and VIII), while experiments\r\nwere continued upon an extensive scale by the Italians F. Fontana,\r\nCarlo Francesco Bellingeri, M. Giulio and F. Rossi, as well as by\r\nSamuel T. Von Sömmering, by Wilhelm Behrends and by Karl Friedrich\r\nKielmayer (Kielmaier), Professor of Medicine at the Tübingen University\r\n(Poggendorff, Vol. I. p. 1253).

They absolutely show that the human subject possesses no\r\nspecies of electrical organs which are under the regulation of the\r\nwill. Of his many observations, the following are worth recording: He\r\nfound that the electricity of the body is common to all ages and sexes;\r\nthat its intensity and character often vary in the same body (in 2422\r\nexperiments, it was 1252 times positive, 771 times negative and 399\r\ntimes imperceptible); that the electricity of the body is naturally\r\npositive, it being always so when subject to no violent exertion,\r\nand that when the body is subjected to sudden or violent motion the\r\nelectricity becomes negative, the case also when the body experiences\r\neither cold or extreme lassitude.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Encycl.

From this\r\nit appears that he (Lomond) has made an alphabet of motions. As the\r\nlength of the brass wire makes no difference in the effect, you could\r\ncorrespond with it at a great distance, as, for example, with a\r\nbesieged city or for objects of much more importance.

These cubes are white, have a specific gravity of 2·566,\r\nand are composed of two atoms of boracic acid combined with one atom\r\nof magnesia. They are distinguished among mineralogists by the name of\r\n_boracite_. If we examine the cubic crystals of boracite, we shall find\r\nthat only four of the solid angles are complete, constituting alternate\r\nangles placed at the extremity of two opposite diagonals at the upper\r\nand lower surface of the cube. The other four solid angles are replaced\r\nby small equilateral triangles. When the boracite is heated all the\r\nperfect solid angles become charged with _negative_ electricity, while\r\nall the angles replaced by equilateral triangles become charged with\r\n_positive_ electricity. So that the boracite has eight poles: four\r\npositive and four negative. Those are obviously the extremities of four\r\ndiagonals connecting the solid angles with each other. One extremity\r\nof each of these diagonals is charged with positive and the other\r\nextremity with negative electricity. In general, the electricity of\r\nboracite is not so strong as that of the _tourmaline_.” This curious\r\nlaw of the excitability of the boracite and of its eight poles was\r\ndiscovered by Haüy in 1791 (Haüy’s “Minéralogie,” 260, second edition).\r\n\r\n_Axinite_, _mesotype_, and the _silicate of zinc_ are also minerals\r\nwhich become electric when heated, and which, like the _tourmaline_,\r\nexhibit two opposite poles, the one positive, the other negative. It\r\nis not every crystal of axinite and mesotype which possesses this\r\nproperty, but such only as are unsymmetrical, that is to say, such as\r\nhave extremities of different shapes. No doubt this remark applies\r\nalso to the silicate of zinc; though as the crystals of that mineral\r\nare usually acicular it is not so easy to determine by observation the\r\ndegree of symmetry which they may possess.\r\n\r\nThe _topaz_, _prehnite_, and the titaniferous mineral called _sphene_\r\nare also capable of being excited by heat, and have two opposite poles\r\nlike those already mentioned.\r\n\r\nHaüy also made the most extensive and accurate observations known\r\nupon the development of electricity in minerals by friction. Detailed\r\nlists of the different classes of minerals, as well as the conclusions\r\narrived at through various experiments, are given in the “Encyclopedia\r\nBritannica,” Vol. VIII, 1855, pp. 538, 539, while at pp. 529 and 558\r\nof the same work are to be found accounts of his observations on the\r\nelectricity of the _tourmaline_, as well as a description of the\r\ndifferent electroscopes employed in his many experiments.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Priestley, “History of Electricity,” 1767, pp.\r\n   314–326; Gmelin’s “Chemistry,” Vol. I. p. 319; Noad, “Manual,”\r\n   pp. 27–31; also article “Electricity” in “Library Useful\r\n   Knowledge,” pp. 3, 54, 56; M.

Abraham), F.R.S., first describes in\r\nthe _Philosophical Transactions_ for this year, pp. 26–32, the\r\ngold-leaf electroscope which bears his name and which is considered\r\nthe most sensitive and the most important of all known instruments for\r\ndetecting the presence of electricity. It consists of a glass cylinder\r\nwhich is covered with a projecting brass cap, made flat in order to\r\nreceive upon it whatever article or substance is to be electrified,\r\nand having an opening for the insertion of wires and of a metallic\r\npoint to collect the electricity of the atmosphere. The interior of the\r\ncap holds a tube which carries two strips of gold leaf in lieu of the\r\ncustomary wires or threads, and upon two opposite sides of the interior\r\nof the cylinder are pasted two pieces of tinfoil directly facing the\r\ngold-leaf strips. The cap is turned around until the strips hang\r\nparallel to the pieces of tinfoil, so that any electricity present will\r\ncause the strips to diverge and make them strike the tinfoil, which\r\nwill carry the electricity through the support of the cylinder to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThis electroscope, says Wilkinson, possesses great sensibility, and\r\nthrough the movable coatings introduced by Mr. Pepys, very small\r\nportions of electricity are discernible. Another very excellent\r\nelectroscope is formed with either extremely fine silver thread,\r\nprepared after the manner of Mr. Read, or with the minutest thread\r\nfound in a bundle of very fine flax, having a little isinglass glue\r\napplied gently over it with the finger and thumb.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous observations made by Bennet, the following interesting\r\nextract relative to the phenomenon of evaporation is taken from the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_ for the year 1787. “If a metal\r\ncup with a red hot coal in it be placed upon the cap of a gold leaf\r\nelectroscope, a spoonful of water thrown in electrifies the cup\r\nresinously; and if a bent wire be placed in the cup with a piece of\r\npaper fastened to it to increase its surface, the vitreous electricity\r\nof the ascending column of vapour may be seen by introducing the paper\r\ninto it. The experiments on the evaporation of water may be tried\r\nwith more ease and certainty of success by heating the small end of a\r\ntobacco pipe and pouring water into the head, which, running down to\r\nthe heated part, is suddenly expanded, and will show its electricity\r\nwhen projected upon the cap of the electrometer more sensibly than any\r\nother way that I have tried. If the pipe be fixed in a cloven stick and\r\nplaced in the cup of one electrometer while the steam is projected upon\r\nanother, it produces both electricities at once.”\r\n\r\nSome of Mr. Bennet’s experiments with the electroscope on the\r\nelectricity of sifted powders, upon the electricity of the atmosphere,\r\netc., are recorded at pp. 564 and 566 of the “Britannica,” Vol. VIII,\r\nand at p. 56 of “Library of Useful Knowledge.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bennet also invented the _electrical doubler_, designed to increase\r\nsmall quantities of electricity by continually doubling them until\r\nvisible in sparks or until the common electrometer indicates their\r\npresence and quality (_Phil. Trans._ for 1787, p. 288). It consists of\r\nthree plates of brass, illustrated and explained at Fig. 9, p. 20, Vol.\r\nI of Prescott’s “Electricity and the Electric Telegraph,” 1885 edition,\r\nwherein it is stated that in forty seconds the electricity can thus, by\r\ncontinual duplication, be augmented five hundred thousand times. (See,\r\nfor doublers, C. B. Désormes and J. N. P. Hachette, in _Annales de\r\nChimie_, Vol. XLIX for 1804; J. Read (_Phil. Trans._ for 1794, p. 266);\r\nSir Francis Ronalds (Edin. “Phil. Journal,” Vol. IX. pp. 323–325).)\r\n\r\nAt p. 105 of his “Rudim. Magnetism,” Snow Harris mentions the fact\r\nthat, in some of his experiments, Mr. Bennet employed a magnetic\r\nneedle suspended by filaments of a spider’s web as a magnetometer.\r\nIn this connection, it may be said that, in the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_ for 1792, the assertion is made that a fine, and\r\nweakly magnetic steel wire suspended from a spider’s thread of three\r\ninches in length will admit of being twisted around eighteen thousand\r\ntimes and yet continue to point accurately in the meridian, so little\r\nis the thread sensible of torsion (Young’s “Course of Lectures,” 1807,\r\nVol. II. p. 445). The use of the spider’s line had, during the year\r\n1775, been recommended as a substitute for wires by Gregorio Fontana,\r\nwho, it is said, obtained threads as fine as the eight-thousandth\r\npart of a line. In a lecture delivered at Boston, Mass., during the\r\nyear 1884, Prof. Wood alluded to spiders’ threads estimated to be one\r\ntwo-millionths of a hair in thickness.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Bennet, “New Experiments on Electricity,” etc.,\r\n   Derby, 1789, and “A New Suspension of the Magnetic Needle,”\r\n   etc., London, 1792; Introduction to “Electrical Researches,” by\r\n   Lord Henry Cavendish; _Sc.

These were “presumed to be\r\nso far improved that they could convey their directive power to a\r\ndistance, thus, by the sympathetic movements of the hands or needles in\r\nconnection with a dial alphabet, communications between distant friends\r\ncould be carried on.”\r\n\r\nWriting to Mme. du Deffand in 1772, he observes:\r\n\r\n“It is said that with two timepieces the hands of which are magnetic,\r\nit is enough to move one of these hands to make the other take the\r\nsame direction, so that by causing one to strike twelve the other will\r\nstrike the same hour. Let us suppose that artificial magnets were\r\nimproved to the point that their virtue could communicate itself from\r\nhere to Paris; you have one of these timepieces, we another of them;\r\ninstead of hours we find the letters of the alphabet on the dial. Every\r\nday at a certain hour we turn the hand, and M. Wiard [Mme. du Deffand’s\r\nsecretary] puts together the letters and reads.... This idea pleases\r\nme immensely.

This he\r\ncommunicates through his “Uber d. Elektricität d. Staubbachs,”\r\npublished at Leipzig.\r\n\r\nIn the Report on Atmospheric Electricity of Francis J. F. Duprez,\r\ntranslated from the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Brussels by Dr. L.\r\nD. Gale, we read that one day while in the Alps, opposite the cascade\r\nof Staubbach, near Lauterbrunnen, Tralles “presented his atmospheric\r\nelectrometer, not armed with the metallic wire, to the fine spray which\r\nresulted from the dispersion of the water. He immediately obtained very\r\ndistinct signs of negative electricity. The same effect was exhibited\r\nat the cascade of Reichenbach. Volta, a short time after, verified the\r\ncorrectness of this observation, not only above the great cascades,\r\nbut also wherever a fall of water existed, however small, provided\r\nthe intervention of the wind caused the dispersion of the drops. The\r\nelectricity always appeared to him, as it did to Tralles, negative.\r\nSchübler repeated the same experiments in his journey to the Alps in\r\n1813. He observed farther, that this negative electricity was very\r\nstrong, since it became perceptible at a distance of 300 feet from the\r\ncascade of Reichenbach; and at a distance of 100 feet his electrometer\r\nindicated 400 and even 500 degrees.... Tralles attributed it at first\r\nto the friction of the minute drops of water against the air; but soon\r\nafter he thought, with Volta, that the cause was to be found in the\r\nevaporation which the same minute drops experience in falling....”\r\n\r\nThe Italian physicist, Giuseppe Belli, who published at Milan,\r\nduring 1836, “Sulla Elettricità negativa delle cascate,” entertains\r\nan opinion contrary to that advanced by M. Becquerel, and believes\r\n“that the electrical phenomenon of the water of cascades is owing to\r\nthe development of electricity by the induction which the positive\r\nelectricity of the atmosphere exercises on the water. The water, he\r\nsays, is by induction in the negative state, when the atmosphere is,\r\nas it is ordinarily, charged with positive electricity. At the moment\r\nwhen this water divides into thousands of minute drops, it cannot fail\r\nto carry the electricity with which the electrical induction of the\r\natmosphere has impregnated it to all bodies which it meets.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Œuvres de Volta,” Vol. II. p. 239; Franz Samuel\r\n   Wilde, “Expériences sur l’électricité des cascades” (“Mémoires\r\n   de Lausanne,” Vol. III, “Histoire,” p. 13, 1790); “Bibliographie\r\n   Universelle,” N.

Eandi, who was, like his uncle, a\r\npupil of Beccaria, publishes his views concerning the electricity of\r\nbodies and regarding other investigations, as well as a report upon\r\nexperiments relative to the electricity of water and of ice, which\r\nappear respectively in L. V. Brugnatelli’s _Annali di Chimica_,\r\nVol. I. p. 53, in the “Bibl. Fis. d’Europa,” Vol. XVII. p. 144, and in\r\nthe third volume of “Mem. della Soc. Italiana.”\r\n\r\nHe was one of the most prolific of Italian writers, his more important\r\nessays, which number 160, being written in Italian, Latin and French,\r\nand covering almost every leading branch of physical science. One of\r\nhis biographers tells us, _Il a embrassé, pour ainsi dire, l’ensemble\r\ndes connaissances humaines_, and that he is one of whom his country\r\nmay justly be proud.\r\n\r\nIn his investigations concerning aerolites, which appeared in\r\n1786 (“Memoria ... sopra ... bolidi in generale”), he explains\r\nthe movements of those bodies much more satisfactorily than had\r\npreviously been done by any scientist. Essays published by him during\r\nthe same year, as well as in 1789 and 1791, treat of the effect of\r\nelectricity upon vegetables; then follow his papers relative to\r\nBertholon’s “Electricité des Météores,” to Haüy’s theories and to the\r\nmeteorological observations of Senebier, De Saussure, Toaldo and Monge,\r\nup to 1792, when Vassalli was made Professor of Natural Philosophy at\r\nthe Turin University. He had also in the meantime carefully looked\r\ninto the scientific knowledge possessed by the ancients, and was led\r\nto believe, as shown in his “Conghietture sopra l’arte,” etc., that\r\nthey had the means of attracting and directing thunder and lightning.\r\nThe latter fact has been alluded to in this “Bibliographical History,”\r\nunder the B.C. 600 entry. (See J. Bouillet, “De l’état des\r\nconnaissances,” etc., Saint Etienne, 1862.)\r\n\r\nHe was after this made perpetual secretary of the Royal Academy of\r\nSciences of Turin, then became Director of the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory, as well as of the Observatory situated in the last-named city,\r\nwhich position he held at the time of his death.\r\n\r\nHis other essays treat more particularly of animal electricity, the\r\nelectricity of fishes, the effects of electricity upon recently\r\ndecapitated bodies, the application of electricity and of galvanism to\r\nmedicine, and cover very extended observations on meteorology. He was\r\nthe editor of both the “Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences of Turin,\r\nfrom 1792 to 1809,” and of the “Annals of the Turin Observatory, from\r\n1809 to 1818” (Larousse, “Dictionnaire Universel,” Vol. XV. p. 801);\r\nwas likewise editor of the “Bibliothèque Italienne,” in conjunction\r\nwith Giulio Gioberti and Francesco Rossi, and is said to have devised\r\nan electrometer superior to that of Volta.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Vassalli-Eandi, Giulio (or Julio) e Rossi, “Rapport\r\n   présenté,” etc., Turin, 1802, or “Transunto del Rapporto,” etc.,\r\n   Milano, 1803 (“Opusc.

III of the first volume of Gmelin’s\r\n“Handbook of Chemistry,” it is stated that during 1791 James Keir\r\n(Kier) first showed, by immersing iron in a solution of nitrate of\r\nsilver or fuming nitric acid, that many metals can be made to pass from\r\ntheir ordinary _active_ state into a _passive_ or electro-negative\r\nstate and lose either wholly or in part their tendency to decompose\r\nacids and metallic oxides.\r\n\r\nAt pp. 167–170, Sixth Memoir, of Wm. Sturgeon’s “Scientific Researches”\r\n(Bury, 1850), treating of the application of electro-chemistry to the\r\ndissolution of simple metals in fluids, reference is made to the long\r\nline of investigations carried on by both Bergman and Keir, the last\r\nnamed having demonstrated that iron “acquires that _altered_\r\nstate by the action of nitric acid which Sir John Herschel met with\r\nin his experiments, and has called _prepared_ state, and that\r\nSchönbein and others call the _peculiar_ or the _inactive_\r\nstate” (Noad’s “Manual of Electricity,” London, 1859, p. 534). The iron\r\nwhich is active in nitric acid was called by Keir “fresh iron,” while\r\nthat which became inactive he designated as “altered iron” (Sturgeon’s\r\n“Annals of Electricity,” Vol. V. p. 439).\r\n\r\nSome remarkable phenomena in the display of which but one individual\r\npiece of metal is used, as first shown by Keir, remain, Sturgeon says,\r\n“without even an attempt at explanation by any of the philosophers\r\nunder whose notice they have appeared.” Sir John Herschel pronounces\r\nthem as of an “extraordinary character”; Prof. Andrews, after giving\r\nsome very satisfactory explanations of several phenomena, acknowledges\r\nthat he “can offer no explanation of most of the particular facts which\r\nhave been described,” and Professor Schönbein “has not made public any\r\nconclusive explanation of them whatever” (_Phil. Mag._ for October\r\n1837, p. 333, and for April 1838, p. 311).\r\n\r\nThis same James Keir, called by Watt “a mighty chemist” (1735–1820),\r\nhas strangely by some been confounded with Robert Kerr, also a\r\nScotchman, who was an able scientific writer and lived at about the\r\nsame period (1755–1813). Kerr made valuable translations from Lavoisier\r\nand Linnæus which, during 1805, won for him a fellowship in the\r\nEdinburgh Royal Society. (Consult Sidney Lee, “Dict. of Nat.

After describing his\r\ninvestigations with frogs, he remarks that the same movements and\r\ncontractions can be produced on animals with hot blood, but that the\r\nlatter require a peculiar process. He says that after having dissected\r\nthe crural or any other considerable nerve, and cut it at a certain\r\nheight to separate it from its superior part, it should have a piece of\r\ntinfoil wrapped around its summit, and the communication should be made\r\nin the usual way by touching the coating with one of the extremities of\r\nthe exciting arc and the muscles in which the nerve is distributed with\r\nthe other extremity.\r\n\r\nMany other investigations of Berlinghieri were, later on, communicated\r\nto the Société Philomathique, by whom they were successfully renewed,\r\nand, during the year 1810, a translation of his paper on the method of\r\nimparting magnetism to a bar of iron without a magnet appeared at p.\r\n157, Vol. XXXV. of the _Philosophical Magazine_.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Rozier, XL. p. 133, and XLI. p. 314; “Giorn. di\r\n   Med.

Miot,\r\nchief of one of the divisions of the War Department, gave the name of\r\ntelegraph during the year 1793. Chappe had not long before devised a\r\ncontrivance somewhat like that alluded to by Barthélémy (A.D. 1788),\r\nbut it was not apparently brought into use.\r\n\r\nHis _sémaphore_ consisted of a vertical wooden pillar 15 feet or 16\r\nfeet high, bearing a transverse beam 11 feet or 12 feet long, which\r\nturned upon its centre and held at each extremity pivoted arms so\r\nworked by cords or levers as to admit of 256 distinct signals. The\r\nsemaphores were placed upon high towers, about four miles apart, on\r\nlevel ground, and even as much as ten miles apart upon intervening\r\nelevations. This system of signals was presented by Chappe to the\r\nAssemblée Législative, and was originally erected during the month of\r\nAugust 1794 upon stations between Paris and Lille (Lisle), a distance\r\nof about 148 miles. One of the first sentences conveyed between the two\r\nplaces by the Committee of Public Safety consumed 13 minutes and 40\r\nseconds, but it was not long before dispatches could be conveyed in two\r\nminutes’ time, and it was through Chappe’s apparatus that the news of\r\nthe recapture of the city of Condé was conveyed to the Assembly shortly\r\nafter the entry of the troops of the Republic.\r\n\r\nIt is not now believed that Claude Chappe was acquainted with the\r\ndevices of either Robert Hooke (at A.D. 1684) or of Guillaume Amontons\r\n(at A.D. 1704), as was at the time claimed by many of his jealous\r\ncontemporaries. No doubt exists that he is justly entitled to the\r\ncredit of having, with the assistance of other members of his family,\r\ndeveloped an entirely new system of signals as well as the mechanism\r\nby which they were operated. The histories of telegraphy written by\r\nI. U. J.

Le Roy, Vicq\r\nd’Azyr, Coulomb and Fourcroy, was directed to repeat them. The most\r\nimportant were repeated in Fourcroy’s laboratory on the 12th of July\r\n1792.\r\n\r\nValli was the first to demonstrate that when an arc of two metals,\r\nplumber’s lead and silver, is employed upon an animal, the most violent\r\ncontractions are produced while the lead is applied to the nerves and\r\nthe silver to the muscles. He also showed that of all metals, zinc,\r\nwhen applied to the nerves, has the most remarkable power of exciting\r\ncontractions; and he found that when a frog had lost its sensibility to\r\nthe passage of a current, it regained it by repose.\r\n\r\nThese experiments were also repeated before the French Royal Society\r\nof Medicine. M. Mauduyt, who was present, deduced from the results\r\nobtained by Valli that the metals were charged with a different\r\nquantity of the electric fluid, in so much that when they were brought\r\nin contact with each other a discharge ensued. And, secondly, that the\r\nanimal body, by which the electric fluid is rendered perceptible, is a\r\nmore delicate electrometer than any one heretofore discovered.\r\n\r\nMany new and very interesting investigations were afterward made by\r\nValli upon different animals, the results of which were given to\r\nthe public through the columns of the _Journal de Physique_ as\r\nshown below. These embrace thirteen experiments upon animals rendered\r\ninsensible by means of opium and powdered tobacco, showing electricity\r\nto be independent of their vitality, as well as others to show that the\r\nelectric fluid is necessary to man and animals. He fully established\r\nthe identity of the nervous and the electric fluids, and proved that\r\nthe convulsions took place by merely bringing the muscles themselves\r\ninto contact with the nerves, without the intervention of any metal\r\nwhatever. In answer to the inquiry of M. Vicq d’Azyr, member of the\r\nlate French Academy of Sciences, he supported by nineteen experiments\r\nthe assertion that however the blood vessels may be, as they assuredly\r\nare, conductors of electricity, the nerves alone prove capable of\r\nexciting muscular movements in consequence of the mode in which they\r\nare disposed.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Brugnatelli, _Annali di Chimica_, Vol. VII. pp.\r\n   40, 213, 228 (and pp. 138, 159, 186, 208 for Caldani); also\r\n   the “Giornale Fis.

Some of his previous observations\r\nin the same line had already been made known through his “Di Moti\r\ndell’ Iride,” 1765, and “Richerche filosofiche,” 1775, all which led\r\nto an active correspondence in after years with the Italian Giochino\r\nCarradori, as will be seen by consulting the volumes of Luigi Valentino\r\nBrugnatelli’s well-known “Giomale Fisico-Medico” (Cuvier, in “Biog.\r\nUniv.,” Vol. XV. p. 8, par. 1816; “Giornale Fisico-Medico,” Vol. IV. p.\r\n116).\r\n\r\nFontana (Gregorio), younger brother of Felice Fontana, likewise an\r\nable natural philosopher, succeeded the celebrated Ruggiero Giuseppe\r\nBoscovich in the Chair of Higher Mathematics at the University of\r\nPadua, and is the author of “Disquisitiones physico-mathematicæ,”\r\nPapiæ, 1780, as well as of many papers in the “Mem. della Soc.

Canterzani, in the Chair of Physics\r\nat the Bologna University, established in the last-named Institution a\r\nscientific society whose open object was to combat all of Volta’s works\r\nand which became very hostile to the organization already formed in the\r\nUniversity of Pavia by Felice Fontana, Bassiano Carminati and Gioachino\r\nCarradori against the followers of Galvani. Similar societies espousing\r\nthe cause of Volta were subsequently organized in England, at the\r\nsuggestion of Cavallo and others, and during five years, the scientists\r\nof Europe were divided between the two discoverers, without, however,\r\nany material benefit accruing therefrom to either faction.\r\n\r\nAldini proved to be an indefatigable investigator, as shown by the\r\nnumerous Memoirs sent by him to the publications named below, up to\r\nthe month of October 1802, when he experimented before the Galvani\r\nSociety of Paris. An account of these experiments is given in his\r\n“Essai théorique,” etc., where, among other results, attention is\r\ncalled to the curious fact that contractions can be excited in a\r\nprepared frog by holding it in the hand and plunging its nerves into\r\nthe interior of a wound made in the muscle of a living animal (Figuier,\r\n“Exposition,” etc., Vol. IV. p. 308). His interesting investigations\r\nof the artificial piles of muscle and brain, first made by M. La Grave\r\nand shown to the French Galvani Society, are alluded to in _Nicholson’s\r\nJournal_, Vol. X. p. 30, in the _Journal de Physique_, An. XI. pp. 140,\r\n159, 233, 472, and in Sturgeon’s “Scientific Researches,” Bury, 1850,\r\np. 195.\r\n\r\nNearly all of Aldini’s experiments were successfully repeated in\r\nLondon at Mr. Wilson’s Anatomical Theatre, where Mr. Cuthbertson\r\nassisted Prof. Aldini in arranging the apparatus, and where a student,\r\nby the name of Hutchins, furnished the anatomical preparations, but\r\nthe demonstration, of all others, which attracted most attention was\r\ndoubtless the one made in London on the 17th of January 1803. The\r\nmurderer Forster had just been executed and, after his body lay for\r\none hour exposed in the cold at Newgate, it was handed over to Mr.\r\nKoate, President of the London College of Surgeons, who, with Aldini,\r\nmade upon it numerous important observations to ascertain the precise\r\neffects of galvanism with a voltaic column of one hundred and twenty\r\ncopper and zinc couples. The extraordinary results obtained, which\r\ncannot properly be enumerated here, are to be found in the “Essai\r\nThéorique,” etc., already alluded to. They led Aldini to believe\r\nhe could, by the galvanic agency, bring back those in whom life was\r\nnot totally extinct, such as in cases of the recently drowned or\r\nasphyxiated. (Consult M. Bonnejoy’s method of proving death by ...\r\nFaradization, Paris, 1866, and Georgio Anselmo, “Effets du Galvanisme\r\n...” Turin, 1803; S. T.

Henley, for\r\nelectricity as a stimulant ... drowned or ... suffocated, “Trans. of\r\nthe Humane Society,” Vol. I. p. 63.)\r\n\r\nAnother of Aldini’s curious experiments was the production of very\r\npowerful muscular contractions upon the heads of oxen and other\r\nanimals recently decapitated, by introducing into one of the ears a\r\nwire connecting with one of the battery poles and into the nostrils\r\nor tongue a wire communicating with the other pole. Thus were the\r\neyes made repeatedly to open and roll in their orbits while the ears\r\nwould shake, the tongue move and the nostrils dilate very perceptibly\r\n(De la Rive, “A Treatise on Electricity,” 1856, Vol. II. p. 489, and\r\n1858, Vol. III. p. 588; Pepper, “Voltaic Electricity,” 1869, pp. 287,\r\n288). In the experiments which Aldini made during 1804 upon corpses,\r\nthe body became violently agitated and even raised itself as if about\r\nto walk, the arms alternately rose and fell and the forearm was made\r\nto hold a weight of several pounds, while the fists clenched and beat\r\nviolently the table upon which the body lay. Natural respiration was\r\nalso artificially re-established and, through pressure exerted against\r\nthe ribs, a lighted candle placed before the mouth was several times\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nFor the experiments of the eminent French physiologist and anatomist\r\nMarie François Xavier Bichat, of Vassalli-Eandi, Giulio, Rossi, Nysten,\r\nHallé, Mezzini, Klein, Bonnet, Pajot-Laforest, Dudoyon, Berlinghieri,\r\nFontana, Petit-Radel, Alizeau, Lamartillière, Guillotin, Nauche\r\nand others upon animals and men recently decapitated, see Bichat’s\r\n“Recherches Physiologiques sur la vie et la mort,” Paris, 1805;\r\nFrancesco Rossi’s “Rapport des expériences,” etc., Turin, 1803; P.

Gregory at pp. 374–381, Vol. I of his “Economy of Nature,” etc.,\r\nthird edition, published in London during the year 1804.\r\n\r\nDr. Fowler observed that the contractions in a frog are excited by\r\nmaking the metals touch under water even at the distance of an inch\r\nfrom the divided spine of the animal. He succeeded in causing the heart\r\nto contract, but could not produce the same effect upon the stomach\r\nand intestines. He also found, as did Prof. John Robison, of Edinburgh,\r\nat the same period, that the senses of touch and smell are unaffected\r\nby the metals, but that when these are applied to the eye, or, what is\r\nbetter, when they are thrust up between the teeth and the lips, and\r\nthen made to touch, a flash of light is rendered visible. This is the\r\ncase also when the metals are placed between the gums and the upper and\r\nlower lips, as proven by the experiments of Dr. Rutherford and of Mr.\r\nGeorge Hunter, of York. Fowler likewise observed that all pure metals\r\nprove excellent conductors of the galvanic influence and that living\r\nvegetables afford it a ready passage, but that stones and oils seem to\r\nbe possessed of no conducting power whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with Mr. Alexander Munro, Fowler published a work\r\non animal electricity (translated into German under the title of\r\n“Abhandlung ueber thierische elekt.” etc.), while, in the “Bibliotheca\r\nBritannica” for May 1796, mention will be found of the observations of\r\nDr. Fowler respecting the muscular irritability excited by electricity,\r\nas well as on the reproduction of the nervous substance, on the action\r\nof poisons, on the phenomena of muscular contraction, etc. etc.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Essays and Observations,” etc., Edinburgh, 1793,\r\n   in Library of the Royal Institution; Gilbert Blane’s paper read\r\n   to the English Royal Society, of which an extract can be found\r\n   in Bacher’s “Medical Journal,” Vol. XC. p. 127; Figuier, “Exp.\r\n   et Hist. des Princip.

This aurora\r\nwas seen in places one hundred and seventy miles apart and covered an\r\narea of 7000 to 8000 square miles. In Vol. XIV of the same Encyclopædia\r\nwill be found (p. 15), an account of another aurora observed at Kendal,\r\nFebruary 12, 1793, while at p. 12 are given Dalton’s views as to the\r\nconnection between the heat and magnetism of the earth, and, at p.\r\n66, his conclusions as to the cause of the aurora and its magnetic\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Memoirs of Dalton’s Life,” by Dr. W.

These are to be found\r\nthroughout the eighteen volumes and two supplements to the third\r\n“Encyclopædia Britannica,” where they cover such subjects as Physics,\r\nElectricity, Magnetism, Thunder, Variation, etc. etc. Taken together,\r\n“they exhibited,” according to Dr. Thomas Young, “a more complete view\r\nof the modern improvements of physical science than had previously been\r\nin the possession of the British public.”\r\n\r\nIt was after his retirement from the navy that Robison devoted himself\r\nto scientific studies, becoming the successor of Dr. Black in the\r\nlectureship of chemistry at the University of Glasgow during 1766,\r\nand accepting, seven years later (1773), the Professorship of Natural\r\nPhilosophy at Edinburgh, where he taught all branches of physics\r\nand of the higher mathematics. In 1783 he was made Secretary of the\r\nPhilosophical Society of Edinburgh, received the degree of Doctor of\r\nLaws, 1798–1799, and was elected foreign member of the Saint Petersburg\r\nAcademy of Sciences in 1800. Of him, Mr. James Watt wrote, Feb. 7,\r\n1805: “He was a man of the clearest head and the most science of\r\nanybody I have known” (Arago’s “Eloge of Jas. Watt,” London, 1839, p.\r\n81).\r\n\r\nIt was while acting as midshipman under Admiral Saunders that Robison\r\nhimself observed the effect of the aurora borealis on the compass,\r\nwhich had been remarked by Hiörter, Wargentin, and Mairan several years\r\nbefore, but which was not then generally known. The aurora borealis,\r\nhe afterwards wrote, “is observed in Europe to disturb the needle\r\nexceedingly, sometimes drawing it several degrees from its position. It\r\nis always observed to increase its rate of deviation from the meridian;\r\nthat is an aurora borealis makes the needle point more westerly. This\r\ndisturbance sometimes amounts to six or seven degrees, and is generally\r\nobserved to be greatest when the aurora borealis is most remarkable....\r\nVan Swinden says he seldom or never failed to observe aurora borealis\r\nimmediately after any anomalous motion of the needle, and concluded\r\nthat there had been one at the time, though he could not see it....\r\nThis should farther incite us to observe the circumstance formerly\r\nmentioned, viz., that the South end of the dipping needle points to\r\nthat part of the heavens where the rays of the aurora borealis appear\r\nto converge....”\r\n\r\nThe experiments of J. H. Lambert (at A.D. 1766–1776) upon the\r\nlaws of magnetic action were carefully repeated by Robison, who, in\r\n1769 or 1770, tried various methods and made numerous investigations\r\nfrom which he deduced that the force is inversely as the square of\r\nthe distance. When he observed, however, some years afterward, that\r\nÆpinus had in 1777 conceived the force to vary inversely as the simple\r\ndistance, he carefully again repeated the experiments and added others\r\nmade with the same magnet and with the same needle placed at one side\r\nof the magnet instead of above it. By this simple arrangement the\r\nresult was still more satisfactory, and the inverse law of the square\r\nof the distance was well established.\r\n\r\nThroughout his numerous investigations, Prof. Robison found that when\r\na good magnet was struck for three-quarters of an hour, and allowed in\r\nthe meantime to ring, its efficacy was destroyed, although the same\r\noperation had little effect when the ringing was impeded; so that the\r\ncontinued exertion of the cohesive and repulsive powers appears to\r\nfavour the transmission of the magnetic as well as of the electric\r\nfluid. The internal agitation, produced in bending a magnetic wire\r\naround a cylinder, also destroys its polarity, and, it is said, the\r\noperation on a file has the same effect. M. Cavallo found that brass\r\nbecomes generally much more capable of being attracted when it has been\r\nhammered, even between two flints; and that this property is again\r\ndiminished by fire: in this case, Dr. Thomas Young remarks, it may\r\nbe conjectured that hammering increases the conducting power of the\r\niron contained in the brass, and thus renders it more susceptible of\r\nmagnetic action.\r\n\r\nOf his other very important observations in the same line it would\r\nbe difficult to select the most interesting, and it may suffice to\r\ncall attention merely to such as are noted throughout Prof. Alfred M.\r\nMayer’s valuable contributions on “The Magnet, Magnetism,” etc., in\r\nJohnson’s “New Universal Encyclopædia,” as well as in his “Practical\r\nExperiments in Magnetism,” etc., published through the columns of the\r\n_Scientific American Supplement_.\r\n\r\nProf. Robison’s electrical investigations are scarcely less\r\ninteresting. In the theories advanced by Æpinus and Cavendish it\r\nwas shown that the action of the electrical fluid diminished with\r\nthe distance, while M. Coulomb proved, by a series of elaborate\r\nexperiments, that it varied like gravity in the inverse ratio of the\r\nsquare of the distance. Robison had previously determined that in the\r\nmutual repulsion of two similarly electrified spheres the law was\r\nslightly in excess of the inverse duplicate ratio of the distance,\r\nwhile in the attraction of oppositely electrified spheres the deviation\r\nfrom that ratio was in defect; and he therefore arrived at the same\r\nconclusion formed by Lord Stanhope, that the law of electrical\r\nattraction is similar to that of gravity.\r\n\r\nAt the close of Richard Fowler’s “Experiments and Observations,” etc.,\r\nEdinburgh, 1793, is a letter from Prof. Robison, wherein he gives the\r\nfollowing results of many curious investigations, mostly made upon\r\nhimself, to ascertain the effects of the galvanic influence. He found\r\nthe latter influence well defined on applying one of two metallic\r\nsubstances to a wound which he had accidentally received; discovered\r\nby their tastes the solders in gold and silver trinkets; and showed\r\nthat the galvanic sensation can be felt when the metallic substances\r\nare placed at a distance from each other. He proved the last-named fact\r\nby placing a piece of zinc between one of the cheeks and the gums,\r\nand a piece of silver on the opposite side within the other cheek. He\r\nnext introduced a zinc rod between the piece of zinc and the cheek\r\non the one side, and a silver rod between the silver and the cheek\r\non the other, and when he afterward carefully brought into contact\r\nthe extremities of the rods outside the mouth a flash appeared and a\r\npowerful sensation was noticeable in the gums. He experienced the same\r\nsensation when he again separated the rods and brought them to a short\r\ndistance from each other, but he could perceive no galvanic effect\r\nwhen he placed the rods (or wires) in such manner that the silver rod\r\nshould touch the zinc or the zinc rod touch the piece of silver. He\r\nalso ascribed to galvanic effect the well-known fact that the drinking\r\nof porter out of a pewter pot produces a more brisk sensation than when\r\nit is taken out of a glass vessel. In this instance, he says there is\r\na combination of one metal and of two dissimilar fluids. In the act of\r\ndrinking, one side of the pewter pot is exposed to the saliva and the\r\nhumidity of the mouth, while the other metallic side is in contact with\r\nthe porter. In completing the circuit, in the act of drinking, a brisk\r\nand lively sensation arises, which imparts an agreeable relish to the\r\nliquid. He likewise observed that the conducting power of silk thread\r\ndepends greatly on its colour, or rather on the nature of its dye. When\r\nof a brilliant white, or a black, its conducting power is the greatest;\r\nwhile either a high golden yellow or a nut-brown renders it the best\r\ninsulator. Human hair, when completely freed from everything that water\r\ncould wash out of it, and then dried by lime and coated with lac, was\r\nequal to silk.\r\n\r\nRobison’s last publication was made in 1804, one year before his death,\r\nand constituted the first part of a series which was to appear under\r\nthe head of “Elements of Mechanical Philosophy.” This portion, together\r\nwith some MSS. intended for the second part, and his principal articles\r\ncontributed to the “Encyclopædia Britannica,” were collected in 1822 by\r\nSir David Brewster, and published with notes in 4 vols. under the title\r\nof “System of Mechanical Philosophy.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Playfair in “Transactions of the Royal Society of\r\n   Edinburgh,” Vol. VII. p. 495; Stark’s “Biographia Scotica”;\r\n   _Philosophical Magazine_, Vol. XIII. pp. 386–394 (Biogr.\r\n   Memoir); Aikin’s “General Biography,” London, 1813, Vol.\r\n   VIII; Dr. Gleig in _Anti-Jacobin Magazine_ for 1802, Vol. XI;\r\n   Chalmer’s “Biographical Dictionary,” London, 1816, Vol. XXV; Dr.\r\n   Thomas Young, “Course of Lectures,” London, 1807, Vol. II. pp.\r\n   438, 444.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1793.=--Prof. Georg.

Of 987 trials, he found that 664 gave\r\nindications of positive electricity, and out of 404 trials made during\r\ntwelve months, the air was positively electrical in 241, negatively\r\nin 156, and insensible in only seven observations. He also found the\r\nvapour near the ground, in the act of condensing into dew, always\r\nhighly electric.\r\n\r\nHe made many observations upon the electricity of vegetable bodies,\r\nwhich were afterward developed by M. Pouillet, and it was also Mr. Read\r\nwho introduced a new hand-exploring instrument as well as an improved\r\nfixed thunder rod for collecting atmospherical electricity. These are\r\ndescribed at p. 608 of the eighth volume of the 1855 “Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Wilkinson (“Elements of Galvanism,” etc., London,\r\n1804, Vol. II. p. 344), Mr. Read was the first to apply the apparatus\r\ncalled the condenser to the electroscope in order that it should evince\r\nsmall intensities of electricity. He says: “The very minute portion\r\nof the fluid given out by the single contact of two different metals,\r\ndoes not produce any disturbance of the gold leaves; but when several\r\nminute portions are accumulated, a separation of the leaves takes\r\nplace. The electroscope, in its simple state, will be as much charged\r\nthe first time as if the contact had been made a thousand times, and\r\ncannot therefore acquire a greater quantity of the fluid than suffices\r\nto place it _in equilibrio_ with the metallic plates. This portion\r\nbeing inadequate to the production of any divergency of the leaves,\r\nMr. Read applied the principle of the electrical doubler to the above\r\ninstrument, by which means he was enabled to charge an intervening\r\nplate of air. By thus accumulating every minute portion of the fluid\r\nimparted through the metallic plate, and by apparently condensing and\r\nincreasing its intensity, he ultimately succeeded in producing marked\r\nsigns of disturbance.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Philosophical Transactions_ for 1791, p. 185; for\r\n   1792, p. 225; for 1794, pp. 185, 266: also Hutton’s abridgments,\r\n   Vol. XVII. pp. 52, 207, 423; “Bibl.

As Prof. Alexander Herschel informs\r\nus, in his lecture, delivered (1867) before the British Association at\r\nDundee, Chladni conceived that a class of cosmical bodies exists in all\r\nparts of the solar system, each forming by itself a peculiar concourse\r\nof atoms, and that the earth from time to time encounters them, moving\r\nwith a velocity as great as its own, and doubtless in orbits of very\r\nvarious eccentricity around the sun. Prof. Muirhead says that through\r\ntheir exceeding great velocity, which is increased by the attraction\r\nof the earth and the violent friction of the atmosphere, a strong\r\nelectricity and heat must necessarily be excited, by which means they\r\nare reduced to a flaming and melted condition, and great quantities of\r\nvapour and different kinds of gases are thus disengaged, which distend\r\nthe liquid mass to a monstrous size, until, by still further expansion\r\nof these elastic fluids, they must at length explode (Chladni’s\r\nhypothesis in “Enc. Brit.,” article “Meteorolite”).\r\n\r\nHumboldt gives (“Cosmos,” London, 1849, Vol. I. p. 104, note) the\r\nfollowing upon the same subject, taken from Biot’s “Traité d’Astronomie\r\nPhysique,” third edition, 1841, Vol. I. pp. 149, 177, 238, 312: “My\r\nlamented friend Poisson endeavoured in a singular manner to solve the\r\ndifficulty attending an assumption of the spontaneous ignition of\r\nmeteoric stones at an elevation where the density of the atmosphere is\r\nalmost null. These are his words: ‘It is difficult to attribute, as\r\nis usually done, the incandescence of aerolites to friction against\r\nthe molecules of the atmosphere, at an elevation above the earth\r\nwhere the density of the air is almost null. May we not suppose\r\nthat the electric fluid, in a neutral condition, forms a kind of\r\natmosphere, extending far beyond the mass of our own atmosphere, yet\r\nsubject to terrestrial attraction, although physically imponderable,\r\nand consequently following our globe in its motion?’ According to\r\nhis hypothesis, the bodies of which we have been speaking would, on\r\nentering this imponderable atmosphere, decompose the neutral fluid by\r\ntheir unequal action on the two electricities, and they would thus\r\nbe heated, and in a state of incandescence, by becoming electrified”\r\n(Poisson, “Rech. sur la Probabilité des Jugements,” 1837, p. 6).\r\n\r\nThe theories advanced by Chladni were confirmed four years later by\r\nBrandes and Benzenberg at Göttingen, and, during the month of April\r\n1809, he inserted a “Catalogue of Meteors” in the “Bulletin de la\r\nSociété Philomathique,” which was followed by a paper on “Fiery\r\nMeteors” published at Vienna during 1819.\r\n\r\nIn his “Traité d’Acoustique,” Chladni treats of the line of experiments\r\nto which he was led, as well by the discovery of Lichtenberg’s\r\nelectrical figures (see A.D. 1777, and Tyndall, “Sound,”\r\nLecture IV), an account of which latter appeared in the “Mémoires de\r\nla Société Royale de Göttingen,” as through the suggestions made him\r\nby Lichtenberg himself during the year 1792 relative to the origin of\r\nmeteors. The results of Chladni’s researches concerning the last named\r\nappeared in a Memoir published at Leipzig during 1794, translated by M.\r\nEugène Coquebert Mombret for Vol. V of the _Journal des Mines_.\r\n\r\nIt may here be properly added that, in one of the editions of his\r\n“Lectures on Sound,” Prof. Tyndall gives a portrait of Chladni and\r\nquotes a letter received from Prof. Weber wherein he says: “I knew\r\nChladni personally. From my youth up he was my leader and model as a\r\nman of science, and I cannot too thankfully acknowledge the influence\r\nwhich his stimulating encouragement during the last years of his life\r\nhad upon my own scientific labours.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Quetelet (Lambert A.

While treating of this subject, it\r\n   may be well to add here that up to the year 1887 diamonds were\r\n   not known to exist in meteorites. In a very remarkable paper by\r\n   Prof. A. E. Foote, read before the Geological section of the\r\n   Am. Asso. Adv. Sci., at its meeting in Washington, he described\r\n   having, during the month of June 1891, explored Crater Mountain\r\n   (Cañon Diablo), 185 miles north of Tucson, Ariz., where he\r\n   found some extraordinary specimens. The extreme hardness of one\r\n   of these attracted particular attention, and upon carefully\r\n   examining it he discovered in some of the cavities many small\r\n   black diamonds as well as a white diamond one-fiftieth of an\r\n   inch in diameter. This is said to be the most extensive find of\r\n   the kind yet made.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1794.=--Mr. J.

On this\r\nplate are glued little squares of tinfoil, cut after the fashion of\r\nluminous panes, and each standing for a letter of the alphabet. From\r\none side of these little squares extend long wires, enclosed in glass\r\ntubes, which go underground to the place whither the despatch is to be\r\ntransmitted. The distant ends are there connected to tinfoil strips,\r\nsimilar ... to the first, and, like them, each marked by a letter\r\nof the alphabet; the free ends of all the strips are connected to\r\none return wire, which goes to the transmitting table. If, now, one\r\ntouches the outer coating of a Leyden jar with the return wire, and\r\nconnects the inner coating with the free end of that piece of tinfoil\r\nwhich corresponds to the letter required to be indicated, sparks will\r\nbe produced, as well at the near as at the distant tinfoil, and the\r\ncorrespondent there watching will write down the letter....”\r\n\r\nReusser also suggested calling the attention of the correspondent by\r\nfiring an electrical pistol through the spark; to him, therefore,\r\nbelongs the credit of having first clearly indicated the use of a\r\nspecial call for the telegraph.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Vail’s “History,” p. 121; Voigt’s “Magazin ...”\r\n   Vol. VII. part ii. p. 57; Shaffner, “Manual,” pp. 133, 134;\r\n   Forster’s “Bauzeitung,” 1848, p. 238; Ed.

It\r\nconsisted merely of four pointers, in the form of wedges or isosceles\r\ntriangles, placed upon four portable vertical posts and the different\r\npositions of which were arranged to represent letters and numbers.\r\n\r\nEdgeworth claimed to have made experiments, as early as 1767, with\r\nan ordinary windmill, the arms and sails of which were arranged in\r\ndifferent positions to indicate the several letters of the alphabet.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Edgeworth’s Letter to Lord Charlemont on the\r\n   Tellograph, also his “Essay on the Art of Conveying Secret and\r\n   Swift Intelligence,” Dublin, 1797, republished in Vol. VI of the\r\n   _Trans. of the Royal Irish Academy_; “Appleton’s Encycl.,” 1871,\r\n   Vol. XV. p. 334.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1795.--Lord George Murray, of England, submits to the\r\nAdmiralty his six-shutter telegraph, an improvement upon Chappe’s\r\noriginal plan.

By its means,\r\ninformation was transmitted from London to Dover in seven minutes, and\r\nit answered nearly all the requirements of the Admiralty up to the year\r\n1816, when it was superseded by the semaphore of Rear Admiral Popham.\r\nMurray’s method was, however, useless during foggy weather, when relays\r\nof horses had to be employed for conveying the news.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--English Encyclopædia, “Arts and Sciences,” Vol.\r\n   VIII. p. 66; Tomlinson’s “Telegraph”; Turnbull, _El.

It is not necessary to keep\r\ntwenty-two men at Mataro nor twenty-two Leyden jars at Barcelona,\r\nif we fix the ends of each pair of the wires in such a way that one\r\nor two men may be able to discriminate the signals. In this way six\r\nor eight jars at each end would suffice for intercommunication, for\r\nMataro can as easily speak with Barcelona as Barcelona with Mataro ...\r\nor the wires can be rolled together in one strong cable ... laid in\r\nsubterranean tubes, which, for greater insulation, should be covered\r\nwith one or two coats of resin.”\r\n\r\nHe is said to have approved of the use of luminous panes as indicated\r\nby Reusser; to have also suggested, as early as December 16, 1795,\r\nthe idea of a _submarine telegraphic cable_ carrying several\r\nconductors, and to have proposed, at the same period, the laying of a\r\ncable between Barcelona and Palma in the island of Majorca.\r\n\r\nIn 1798, Salvá constructed a single wire telegraphic line between\r\nMadrid and Aranjuez, a distance of twenty-six miles, through which\r\nthe signals were transmitted in the shape of sparks from Leyden jars.\r\nThis is the line which is credited to Augustin de Bétancourt, a French\r\nengineer, by Alexander Von Humboldt, in a note at p. 14 of Gauss and\r\nWeber’s _Resultate_, etc., for the year 1837.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of May 1800, and on the 22nd of February 1804, Salvá\r\ncommunicated to the Academy of Sciences at Barcelona two papers on\r\ngalvanism applied to electricity, wherein he shows that a cheaper\r\nmotive power is produced by the electricity of a number of frogs,\r\nand proposes a telegraphic apparatus in conjunction with the voltaic\r\ncolumn which is illustrated and described at pp. 224 and 225 of Fahie’s\r\n“History of Telegraphy.” From the latter the following is taken: “This\r\nillustrious Spanish physician (Salvá) was therefore the first person\r\nwho attempted to apply electricity dynamically for the purpose of\r\ntelegraphing. It is, says Saavedra, not without reason, I must confess,\r\nnotwithstanding my cosmopolitan opinions on scientific questions,\r\nthat _the Catalans hold Salvá to be the inventor of electric\r\ntelegraphy_. With documents as authentic as those which I have\r\nseen with my own eyes in the very hand writing of this distinguished\r\nprofessor (which documents are at this present moment to be found in\r\nthe library of the Academy of Sciences of Barcelona) it is impossible\r\nfor any author to henceforth deny, even if others did precede Salvá in\r\ntelegraphic experiments with static electricity, that no one preceded\r\nhim in the application of the docile electro-dynamic fluid to distant\r\ncommunications.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Comptes Rendus_, séance, 1838; Memorial of Joseph\r\n   Henry, 1880, p. 224; Ed.

He says that Mr. Walsh found\r\nthe _torpedo_ “possessed of the power of shocking only in two parts of\r\nits body, directly opposite to each other and near to the head. A spot\r\non the back and another on the belly opposite to the former being of a\r\ndifferent colour led him to make the experiment, and he found that the\r\nelectrical virtue was confined to these, and that any other part of the\r\nfish might be handled, without receiving a shock, while it was out of\r\nthe water. Either of these places separately might be handled without\r\nthe shock being received until a communication between them was formed.\r\nThis makes it appear probable that the same may also be the case with\r\nthe Guiana eel. One of these spots must therefore be always in the\r\npositive and the other in the negative state; or, rather, they are both\r\ngenerally in the natural state, until, by an effort of the fish’s will,\r\nthey are suddenly put into different states, as we frequently found\r\nthat the hand might be in the water, which formed the communication,\r\nwithout receiving any shock. This cannot be the case with the Leyden\r\nbottle when charged, which suddenly discharges itself upon forming the\r\ncommunication. Whether there be any electric atmosphere round these\r\nspots in the _torpedo_ we cannot tell, as we had no opportunity of\r\nexamining this matter in the eel, nor have we heard whether Mr. Walsh\r\nmade any experiments for ascertaining this.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ELECTRICITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE\r\n\r\nThe investigations of John Ewing concerning atmospheric electricity\r\nwere in reality quite extensive. He not only repeated the experiments\r\nof Franklin, but he examined thoroughly those of other scientists in\r\nthe same channel, especially the investigations of Henry Eeles, which\r\nwill be found detailed in the latter’s “Trinity College Lectures” as\r\nwell as in his “Philosophical Essays,” London, 1771.\r\n\r\nFor a very interesting historical review of theories as to the origin\r\nof atmospherical electricity, it would be well to consult M.

Trans._ a paper on the influence which incites the muscles\r\nof animals to contract in Galvani’s experiments. Therein he was the\r\nfirst to demonstrate that voltaic action is produced through charcoal\r\ncombined with another substance of different conducting power, and\r\nthis he did by causing noticeable convulsions in a frog through the\r\ncombination of charcoal and zinc. (See “Ency. Met.,” Vol. IV. pp. 220,\r\n221, for the experiments of both Dr. Wells and Dr. Fowler.) Fahie\r\nstates that Davy subsequently constructed a pile which consisted of\r\na series of eight glasses containing well-burned charcoal and zinc,\r\nusing a red sulphate of iron solution as the liquid conductor. It is\r\nsaid this series gave sensible shocks and rapidly decomposed water and\r\nthat, compared with an equal and similar series of silver and zinc,\r\nits effects were much stronger. (See Priestley’s discovery of the\r\nelectrical conductibility of charcoal at A.D. 1767, and the description\r\nof Davy’s charcoal battery in “Jour. Roy. Inst.” and _Nicholson’s\r\nJournal_, N.

(chaps.\r\ni.-viii. pp. 299–386) is devoted to the history of and discoveries\r\nrelative to electricity, its principles and theories, as well as to\r\nelectrical apparatus and electrical phenomena and to galvanism or\r\nanimal electricity.\r\n\r\nGregory is also the author of “Popular Lectures on Experimental\r\nPhilosophy, Astronomy and Chemistry; Intended Chiefly for the Use\r\nof Students and Young Persons,” 2 vols., 12 mo, published in London\r\n1808–1809, one year after Gregory’s death.\r\n\r\nIt was the perusal of the latter work which led Joseph Henry to\r\nembrace a scientific career, just as the reading of “Mrs. Marcet’s\r\nConversations on Chemistry” had induced Michael Faraday to enter the\r\nfield in which he afterward became so highly distinguished. Prof. Asa\r\nGray, in his Biographical Memoir of Henry, says that Gregory’s work\r\nalluded to is an unpretending volume but a sensible one, and that it\r\nbegins by asking three or four questions, such as these: “You throw a\r\nstone, or shoot an arrow into the air; why does it not go forward in\r\nthe line or direction that you give it? Why does it stop at a certain\r\ndistance and then return to you?... On the contrary, why does flame\r\nor smoke always mount upward, though no force is used to send them in\r\nthat direction? And why should not the flame of a candle drop toward\r\nthe floor when you reverse it, or hold it downward, instead of turning\r\nup and ascending into the air?... Again, you look into a clear well\r\nof water and see your own face and figure as if painted there? Why is\r\nthis? You are told that it is done by reflection of light. But what is\r\nreflection of light?” As Prof. Gray remarks, young Henry’s mind was\r\naroused by these apt questions, and allured by the explanations. He now\r\ntook in a sense of what knowledge was. The door to knowledge opened to\r\nhim, that door which it thence became the passion of his life to open\r\nwider. The above-named volume is preserved in Prof. Henry’s library,\r\nand bears upon a fly-leaf the following entry:\r\n\r\n“This book, although by no means a profound work, has, under\r\nProvidence, exerted a remarkable influence upon my life. It\r\naccidentally fell into my hands when I was about sixteen years old, and\r\nwas the first work I ever read with attention. It opened to me a new\r\nworld of thought and enjoyment; invested things before almost unnoticed\r\nwith the highest interest; fixed my mind on the study of nature,\r\nand caused me to resolve at the time of reading it, that I would\r\nimmediately commence to devote my life to the acquisition of knowledge.\r\nJ.

Trans._ for 1797, and\r\na full transcript of it is to be found in _Nicholson’s Journal_, 4to,\r\nVol. I. pp. 241–248, 299–305, and 349–355.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Wilkinson has it, “Dr. Pearson supposes the decomposition of\r\nwater by electricity to be effected by the interposition of the dense\r\nelectric fire, between the constituent elements of the water, which he\r\nplaces beyond the sphere of attraction for each other, each ultimate\r\nparticle of oxygen and hydrogen uniting with a determinate quantity\r\nof the electric fire to bestow on them their gaseous form. Hence the\r\ndoctor supposes that the electric fire, after effecting the disunion,\r\nassumes the state of caloric.\r\n\r\n“On the reproduction of water by the passage of an electric spark\r\nthrough a proportionate quantity of oxygen and hydrogen gases, Dr.\r\nPearson ingeniously conjectures that by the influence of the electric\r\nflame the ultimate particles of these gases, the nearest to the flame,\r\nare driven from it in all directions, so as to be brought within the\r\nsphere of each other’s attractions. In one of these cases Dr. Pearson\r\nsupposes that the caloric destroys the attraction, which in the other\r\ninstance it occasions.\r\n\r\n“It is with diffidence that I take on me to controvert the opinions of\r\nthis very respectable physician; but I presume that the whole of the\r\nphenomena of the synthesis and analysis of water are more readily to be\r\nexplained on the principles I have laid down than by the adoption of\r\nthe mysterious terms of attraction and repulsion. By the operation of\r\ngalvanism, water is more rapidly decomposed than by common electricity.\r\nIn this operation there is no evolution of dense electrical fire, but\r\nmerely a current of a small intensity of electricity acting permanently\r\nand incessantly. To reproduce water, a flame must be generated\r\nsufficient to kindle the contiguous portion of the hydrogen gas, then\r\nthe next portion, and so on, the combustion being preserved by the\r\npresence of the oxygen gas. As these processes proceed with immense\r\nrapidity as soon as the gases are intermixed, so as to appear like one\r\nsudden explosion, the caloric of each of them being thus disengaged,\r\ntheir bases unite and constitute water.”\r\n\r\nDr. Pearson also made many interesting experiments to ascertain the\r\neffect of the application of galvanic electricity for the treatment of\r\ndiseases, and Noad, who describes one of his successful operations,\r\nalso details (“Manual,” pp. 343–349) the observations of many others\r\nin the same line, notably those of Drs.

William\r\nSchlegel, then a medical student.\r\n\r\nNumerous extracts from both the above very important papers, which\r\ntreat extensively of galvanic experiments upon animals, vegetables,\r\nmetals, etc., will be found at pp. 123–195, Vol. I of Sue’s “Histoire\r\ndu Galvanisme,” Paris, 1802. Both dissertations review galvanism from\r\nits origin and make mention of many works which had not up to that time\r\nappeared in print.\r\n\r\nIn the first volume of his “Elements of Galvanism,” London, 1804,\r\nMr. C. H. Wilkinson devotes the entire Chap. VIII (pp. 188–260) to\r\nReinhold’s able review of galvanism, wherein are first cited Gardiner\r\n(author of “Observations on the Animal Economy”), Lughi, Klugel and\r\nGardini as “anterior to the discovery of the doctrine of animal\r\nelectricity.” Then follow accounts of their writings, as well as of\r\nthose of Galvani and of Volta, “the Prince of Italian naturalists,”\r\nafter which due mention is made, in their proper order, of the\r\nobservations of Aldini, Valli, Fontana, Berlinghieri, Monro, Fowler,\r\nCorradori, Robison, Cavallo, Wells, Havgk, Colsmann, Creve, Hermestædt,\r\nKlein, Pfaff, Ackermann, Humboldt (letters to Blumenbach, Crell, Pictet\r\nand M. de Mons), Eschenmeyer, Achard, Grapengieser, Gren, Michaelis,\r\nCaldani, Schmuck, Mezzini, Behrends, Giulio, Ludwig, Webster, Vasco,\r\nHebenstreit and others.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the eighth and last section of Reinhold’s Dissertations,\r\nas Wilkinson expresses it, consists of the exposition of the hypotheses\r\nof different authors on the galvanic fluid. These hypotheses he brings\r\ninto two classes, as they relate to the seat which is assigned to the\r\ncause of the phenomena. The first of these classes belongs to the\r\nanimal which is to be galvanized, and the second to the substance\r\napplied to its body, or to the arc. As the galvanic phenomena are\r\nascribed by several physiologists to electricity, Reinhold makes a\r\nnew division, relatively to the opinion of those who assert that\r\nthe galvanic and electric fluids are the same, and of those who are\r\npersuaded that the former differs from the latter. Under the first head\r\nor division he ranges Galvani, Aldini, Valli, Carradori, Volta, in the\r\nearly time of the discovery; then Schmuck, Voigt, and Hufeland; while\r\nunder the second come Fowler and Humboldt. Of the latter division he\r\nmakes subdivisions, in the first of which he comprehends Volta, Pfaff,\r\nWells, Yelin and Monro, the second embracing Creve and Fabbroni. The\r\nother authors, not having openly avowed their opinion, he passes over\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\nReinhold is likewise the author of “Versuche um die eigentliche,”\r\netc. (Gilb. “Annal.,” X, 1802, pp. 301–355), “Untersuchungen über die\r\nnatur.,” etc. (Gilb. “Annal.,” X, 1802, pp. 450–481, and XII, 1803,\r\npp. 34–48); “Galvanisch-elektrische Versuche,” etc. (Gilb. “Annal.,”\r\nXI, 1802, pp. 375–387); “Geschichte des Galvanismus,” Leipzig, 1803;\r\n“Versuch einer skizzirten,” etc. (Reil. “Archiv.,” VIII, 1807–1808, pp.\r\n305–354); “Ueber Davy’s Versuche” (Gilb. “Annal.,” XXVIII, 1808, pp.\r\n484–485).\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Schlegel, “De Galvanismo”; Figuier, “Exp. et Hist.\r\n   des Principales Découvertes,” Vol. IV. pp. 310, 433; J.

James Madison, then President of\r\nWilliam and Mary College, details several experiments made by him to\r\nascertain the effect of a magnet upon the Torricellian vacuum, and to\r\nexplain the phenomena exhibited by magnets in proximity to iron filings.\r\n\r\nHe says: “Many ingenious men have supposed that the arrangement of the\r\nfilings clearly indicated the passage of a magnetic fluid or effluvia\r\nin curved lines from one pole to another of a different denomination,”\r\nbut that the experiments which he relates prove the attractive force\r\nof the magnets, at either pole, to be the real cause of the phenomena\r\nwhich the filings exhibit, and that the action of the magnet upon the\r\nfilings, when they approach within a certain distance, renders them\r\nmagnetic. In every magnet, says he, there is at least one line, called\r\nthe equator, from which, in the direction of both poles, the attractive\r\npower increases so that the filings will “incline toward them, forming\r\nangles which appear to be such as the resolution of two forces, one\r\nlateral and the other polar, would necessarily produce.”\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson, above named, succeeded Benjamin Franklin as\r\nUnited States Minister Plenipotentiary to Paris, 1784–1789, became\r\nVice-President of the United States in 1796, and was sworn in as the\r\nsuccessor of John Adams to the Presidency on the 4th of March 1801. The\r\nRev. James Madison, D.D., second cousin of the fourth President of the\r\nUnited States bearing the same name, became President of William and\r\nMary College in 1777, and was consecrated first Bishop of Virginia by\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury in Lambeth Palace, Sept. 19, 1790.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Transactions of the Am.

F. N. Jadelot”) appeared\r\nin Paris during the year 1799, before which date, Noad remarks, no one\r\nhad applied the galvanic arc, as he did, to so many animals in various\r\nparts of their bodies. Among other results, he discovered the action of\r\nthe electric current upon the pulsation of the heart, the secretions\r\nfrom wounds, etc., and he proved upon himself that its action was not\r\nlimited to the sole instants of the commencement and end of its passage.\r\n\r\nIn the first volume of his very interesting work on “Galvanism”\r\n(pp. 166–174, 261–310, 407–434) Wilkinson reviews the above-named\r\npublication which M. Vassalli-Eandi, in 1799, pronounced “the most\r\ncomplete that has hitherto appeared.” The following sectional extracts\r\nare mainly taken from Mr. Wilkinson’s book, Chap. IX. part ii.\r\nHumboldt’s first experiments were made with the aid of M. Venturi,\r\nProfessor of Natural Philosophy at Modena, and they were followed\r\nquite assiduously for a while, but it was not until he learned of the\r\nimportant observations made by Fowler, Hunter and Pfaff on animal\r\nelectricity and irritability, that he was spurred on to still further\r\nextended investigations, which were carried on more particularly in\r\npresence of Jurine, Pictet, Scarpa, Tralles and Volta. Humboldt’s work\r\nis divided into ten sections, as follows:\r\n\r\nSect. I treats of the relation between galvanic irritation and\r\nincitability.\r\n\r\nSect. II deals with the galvanic irritation produced without a coating,\r\nor metallic or charcoal substances (repeating the investigations of M.\r\nCotugno, which led to the experiments of Vassalli during 1789).\r\n\r\nSect. III treats of the excitement produced by a simple metallic\r\nsubstance, or by homogeneous metallic parts (detailing the experiments\r\nof Aldini, Galvani, Berlinghieri, Lind, Pfaff and Volta).\r\n\r\nSect. IV discourses on heterogeneous metals. During his experiments\r\nin this line, which were aided by his elder brother, chance led him\r\nto a very interesting discovery. He found that the coatings of the\r\nnerve and muscle being homogeneous, the contractions may be produced\r\nwhen the degree of excitability is extremely feeble, provided the\r\ncoatings of this nature are united by exciting substances, among which\r\nthere is a heterogeneous one, having one of its surfaces covered by\r\na fluid in a state of vapour. This observation, which was originally\r\nmade at the commencement of 1796, surprised Humboldt so much that he\r\ninstantly communicated it to Sömmering, Blumenbach, Hertz and Goethe.\r\nHe had not as yet found recorded in the published works on galvanism\r\nany experiment the result of which had the smallest analogy with his\r\ndiscovery; and it was not until after the publication of the works of\r\nPfaff on animal electricity that he became acquainted with any one\r\nsimilar to his own. There were, however, some differences, as he proves\r\nby several passages cited from the above author.\r\n\r\nSect. V relates to the classification of active substances into\r\n_exciters_ and _conductors_ of the galvanic fluid.\r\n\r\nSect. VI treats of experiments on the comparative effects of animal and\r\nvegetable substances employed in the galvanic chain.\r\n\r\nSect. VII describes, in a tabular form, the conducting substances, and\r\nthose by which the galvanic fluid is insulated. In the employment of\r\nvery long conductors, it was not possible for Humboldt to remark any\r\ninterval between the instant when the muscle contracts and the moment\r\nthe contact of the conductor takes place, the muscle and nerve being\r\nfrom two hundred to three hundred feet distant from each other. This\r\nannounces a celerity of twelve hundred feet per second. The effect\r\nwould be the same, should the conductors even be from ten thousand\r\nto twenty thousand feet in length. Thus Haller, in his physiology,\r\nascribes to the nervous fluid a swiftness sufficient to enable it to\r\nrun over a space of nine thousand feet a second. The calculation of\r\nSauvages is carried to thirty-two thousand four hundred feet in the\r\nsame space of time; and what is still infinitely more surprising, its\r\ncelerity is estimated by the author of the essays on the mechanism of\r\nthe muscles at five hundred and seventy-six millions of feet (upward\r\nof one hundred thousand miles) in the above space of a second of\r\ntime. It ought here to be noticed that the great differences in these\r\ncalculations arise from the different kinds of experiments on which\r\nthey are founded.\r\n\r\nSect. VIII proves that the nerve which is intended to excite\r\ncontractions in a muscle should be organically united with it, and it\r\ndeals with the effects of galvanism upon vegetables, aquatic worms,\r\ninsects and fishes.\r\n\r\nSect. IX describes the effects of galvanism upon amphibious animals,\r\nreferring to the observations of Nollet, Rosel, Haller, Spallanzani, P.\r\nMichaelis and Herembstads.\r\n\r\nSect. X treats of the all-important effects of galvanism upon man, and\r\nmakes allusion to the experiments of Hunter, Pfaff, Fowler, Munro,\r\nRobison, Hecker, Carradori, Achard, Grapengieser, Schmuck, Ludwig,\r\nCreve, Webster and Volta. In speaking of the observations made by the\r\nlast named upon the tongue, he observes that some idea of them had been\r\ngiven thirty years before, in Sulzer’s work entitled “The New Theory of\r\nPleasures,” published in 1767; and that if, at the above period, the\r\nconsideration of the superficial situation of the nerves of the tongue\r\nhad led to the artificial discovery of a nerve, the important discovery\r\nof metallic irritation would have been made in the time of Haller,\r\nFranklin, Trembley, Camper, and Buffon. How great a progress would not\r\nthis revelation have made if the above philosophers had transmitted to\r\nus, thirty years ago, the theory and experiments which we leave to our\r\nsuccessors?\r\n\r\nVolta having singled out the differences, in point of savour, which\r\nresult from galvanic experiments on the tongue according to the nature\r\nand disposition of the coatings, Humboldt repeated these experiments\r\nand added to them several of his own, with a nearly similar result. His\r\ndifferent trials, however, having failed to produce any contraction\r\nof the tongue, appear to have established the truth of the ancient\r\nassertion of Galen, confirmed by Scarpa, namely, that the nerve with\r\nwhich the tongue is supplied by the third branch of the fifth pair is\r\nexclusively devoted to the sense of tasting, and that the ninth pair\r\nare exclusively destined for the motion of the tongue. This has been\r\nevidently proved by the galvanic experiments on the nerve in question.\r\n\r\nThe termination, in the pituitous membrane, of the nerves belonging\r\nto the organ of smelling, which originate in the first pair and in\r\nthe first two branches of the fifth, together with the observation of\r\nthe innumerable phenomena of sympathy between the organs of sight and\r\nthose of smell and taste, had led to a presumption that, by galvanizing\r\nthe nostrils, the smell would be affected. This supposition has not,\r\nhowever, been confirmed by any experiment.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh chapter of Wilkinson’s work contains the analysis of\r\nthe report drawn up by Mr. J. N. Hallé in behalf of the commission\r\nappointed by the French National Institute. This commission, which was\r\norganized to look into (_examiner et vérifier_) the different\r\ngalvanic experiments which had been made and to ascertain their effects\r\nand results, was composed of such distinguished French physiologists as\r\nCoulomb, Fourcroy, Vauquelin, Charles, Sabathier, Hallé, Pelletan and\r\nGuyton de Morveau, who were afterward joined by both Humboldt and the\r\ncelebrated Prof. Venturi, of Modena.\r\n\r\nHumboldt’s observations respecting the application of galvanism to\r\nmedicine are embodied in his well-known letter to M. Loder, inserted\r\nin “La Bibliothèque Germanique,” Vol. IV, Messidor, An. VIII. p. 301,\r\nand are likewise detailed by Wilkinson (Chap. XIII) where references\r\nare made, more particularly, to the experiments of Hufeland, Behrends,\r\nCreve, Hymly, Pfaff and Anschell.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1799 and 1804 Von Humboldt made observations upon\r\nthe magnetic intensity of the earth, of which an account will be found\r\nin Vol. XV of the _Annalen der Physik_. These were made upon the\r\nAmerican Continent during the course of his well-known journey, the\r\nequal of which latter, says Petersen, has not been seen since the days\r\nwhen Alexander the Great fitted out an extensive scientific expedition\r\nfor Aristotle.\r\n\r\nHumboldt’s observations in the same line were continued for many years,\r\nnotably between 1805 and 1806, in company with Gay-Lussac during\r\na tour which they made together through France, Switzerland, Italy\r\nand Germany, as related in the first volume of the _Mémoires de la\r\nSociété d’Arcueil_.\r\n\r\nSome idea can be formed of the extent of Humboldt’s share in the\r\nmagnetical labours of the first half of the century by perusing the\r\nlast chapters of his “Cosmos” and the third volume of his “Relation\r\nHistorique.” At p. 615 of the last-named work, he himself says: “The\r\nobservations on the variation of terrestrial magnetism, to which I\r\nhave devoted myself for thirty-two years, by means of instruments\r\nwhich admit of comparison with one another, in America, Europe and\r\nAsia, embrace an area extending over 188 degrees of longitude from the\r\nfrontier of Chinese Dzoungarie to the West of the South Sea, bathing\r\nthe coasts of Mexico and Peru, and reaching from 60 degrees North\r\nlatitude to 12 degrees South latitude. I regard the discovery of the\r\nlaw of the decrement of magnetic force from the pole to the equator as\r\nthe most important result of my American voyage.”\r\n\r\nHumboldt was the first who made especial observations of\r\nthose irregular perturbations to which he applied the name of\r\n“magnetic-storms,” and the effects of which he originally observed at\r\nBerlin in 1806. These are treated of in his “Cosmos,” London, 1858,\r\nVol. V. pp. 135, etc., wherein he states that, when the ordinary\r\nhorary movement of the needle is interrupted by a magnetic-storm, the\r\nperturbation manifests itself often simultaneously, in the strictest\r\nsense of the word, over land and sea, covering hundreds and thousands\r\nof miles, or propagates itself gradually, in short intervals of\r\ntime, in every direction over the earth’s surface. In this same work\r\n(“Cosmos,” Sabine’s translation, Vol. I. p. 180), he contributes a\r\ngraphic description of the concurrent and successive phases of a\r\ncomplete aurora borealis, reference to which is made by Noad (“Manual,”\r\netc., pp. 228, 229, 235), who, likewise, gives (pp. 612–615) an account\r\nof the establishment of magnetic stations at different points, for\r\nsimultaneous observations, upon a plan originally laid out by Humboldt.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1806, this great naturalist had published at Erfurt\r\nhis “Inquiry Concerning Electrical Fishes.” While at Naples with\r\nGay-Lussac, during the previous year, they had examined the properties\r\nof the _torpedo_, and had observed more particularly that the animal\r\nmust be irritated previous to the shock, preceding which latter a\r\nconvulsive movement of the pectoral fins is noticeable, and that\r\nelectrical action is prevented by the least injury done to the brain\r\nof the fish; also, that a person accustomed to electrical discharges\r\ncould with difficulty support the shock of a vigorous torpedo only\r\nfourteen inches long; that the discharge can be felt with a single\r\nfinger placed upon the electrical organs, and that an insulated person\r\nwill not receive the shock if the fish is touched with a key or other\r\nconducting body (_Phil. Mag._, Vol. XXII. p. 356; _Annales de Chimie_,\r\nNo. 166; “Encycl. Brit.,” 1855, Vol. VIII. p. 573). Humboldt’s account\r\nof the mode of capturing gymnoti is detailed at pp. 575, 576 of the\r\nlast-named work, as well as at pp. 472–474 of Noad’s “Manual of\r\nElectricity,” London, 1859.\r\n\r\nAt request of the King of Prussia, Humboldt returned from Paris to his\r\nnative city in 1827, and it was during the winter of 1827–1828 that he\r\nbegan in Berlin his lectures on “Cosmos, or Physical Universe.” This\r\nis the title of his chief work, which has universally been recognized\r\none of the greatest productions ever published, and one which Ritter\r\npronounced as being the culminating point both in the history of\r\nscience and in the annals of civilization.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Klenke, “Alex.

Their pile consisted\r\nof seventeen silver half-crown pieces alternated with equal discs of\r\ncopper and cloth soaked in a weak solution of ordinary salt, and,\r\nhaving used a little water to make good the contact of the conducting\r\nwire with a plate to which the electricity was to be transmitted,\r\nCarlisle observed that gas was being set free in the water, while\r\nNicholson recognized the odour of hydrogen proceeding from it. The\r\nbetter to observe this result they afterward (May 2, 1800) employed a\r\nsmall glass tube, which, after being filled with water, was stopped at\r\nboth ends with corks through which passed two brass wires extending\r\na little distance into the water. When platinum wires were used, gas\r\nbubbles appeared from both wires, and the two gases, hydrogen from the\r\nnegative and oxygen from the positive end, were found to be nearly in\r\nthe proportion to constitute water. (See account of above in Pepper’s\r\n“Electricity,” p. 312, as well as at pp. 193 and 194 of Fahie’s\r\n“History of Telegraphy to 1837,” and at pp. 339 and 340 of Vol. I of\r\nLardner’s “Lectures.”)\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1781 William Nicholson had published the first edition\r\nof “An Introduction to Natural Philosophy.” In the second section of\r\nthe third book of the latter work he treats of magnetism, the methods\r\nof communicating it, and the variation of the compass. The loadstone,\r\nhe says, “is a ponderous ore of iron, usually of a dirty black colour\r\nand hard enough to emit sparks with steel. It is found in most parts\r\nof the world, and possesses a natural magnetism acquired most probably\r\nfrom its situation or position with respect to the earth.” In the\r\nthird section of the same third book he discourses upon electrical\r\nmatter, electrical jars, electrical instruments, and devotes much\r\nspace to the explanation of experiments and facts touching natural and\r\natmospheric electricity, balls of fire, of the _ignis fatuus_, or\r\n_will-with-the-wisp_, of waterspouts, earthquakes, etc., alluding\r\nto most of the then well-known observations thereon recorded by\r\ndifferent scientists.\r\n\r\nTo Nicholson is due the invention of a revolving doubler, an\r\nimprovement upon that of Abraham Bennet, which is described and\r\nillustrated in the “Encyclopædia Britannica,” as well as in No. 647,\r\np. 10327, of the _Sci.

Cavallo’s remarks upon the defects\r\nin Bennet’s doubler).\r\n\r\nThe above-named discovery of Nicholson and Carlisle, which, Mr. Davy\r\nsays (_Phil. Trans._ for 1826, p. 386) was the true origin of all that\r\nhad been previously done in electro-chemical science, together with\r\nHisinger and Berzelius’ decomposition of salts, and the successful\r\ndecomposition of ammonia, nitric acid, etc., made by the distinguished\r\nEnglish chemical philosopher, Dr. William Henry (_Nicholson’s Journal_,\r\nVol. IV. pp. 30, 209, 223 and 245; “Encyclopædia Metropolitana,” Vol.\r\nIV. pp. 221 and 611; Hutton’s abridgment of _Phil.

It\r\nwas for a contrivance which he operated between Martha’s Vineyard and\r\nBoston, about ninety miles’ distance, from hilltop to hilltop, and\r\nwhich was sighted by telescopes (“Telegraph in America,” J. D. Reid,\r\n1887, p. 5; also “Growth of Industrial Art,” Washington, 1888, p. 55).\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1800.=--Cruikshanks (William), of Woolwich, England, confirms\r\nNicholson and Carlisle’s experiments, and, in his further prosecution\r\nof them, employs a pile consisting of from forty to a hundred pairs of\r\nzinc and silver plates, as well as a tube holding silver terminals or\r\nelectrodes, in place of the platinum electrodes, which they were first\r\nto make use of.\r\n\r\nHe discovers that hydrogen is always evolved from the silver or copper\r\nend of the voltaic pile and oxygen from the other; that, under like\r\ncircumstances, metals can be “completely revived” from their solutions;\r\nthat pure oxygen is freed when a wire of non-oxidable metal, like\r\ngold, is connected with the zinc plate, and that fluids that contain\r\nno oxygen cannot transmit the voltaic current. These results were\r\nverified by Lieut. Col. Henry Haldane, whose many observations upon the\r\nseries of metals best suited to the production of voltaic electricity\r\nand their respective powers in connection therewith are related at pp.\r\n242 and 313, Vol. IV of _Nicholson’s Journal_ for Sept. and Oct. 1800.\r\n\r\nCruikshanks was also the first to discover, in 1800, that when passing\r\nthe electric current through water tinged with lithmus, the wire\r\nconnected with the zinc end of the pile imparted a red tinge to the\r\nfluid contiguous to it, and that by using water coloured with Brazil\r\nwood, the wire connected with the silver end of the pile produced a\r\ndeeper shade of colour in the surrounding fluid, whence it appeared\r\nthat an acid was formed in the former case, and an alkali in the\r\nlatter. Fahie, who thus mentions the fact, justly remarks that upon\r\nthis discovery are dependent the electro-chemical telegraphs proposed\r\nby Bakewell, Caselli, Bonelli, D’Arlincourt, Sawyer and others.\r\n\r\nCruikshanks is the inventor of the galvanic trough, an improvement\r\nupon the voltaic pile, made by soldering together rectangular plates\r\nof zinc and copper, and so arranging them horizontally, in a box of\r\nbaked wood coated with an insulating substance, as to allow of open\r\nspaces which can be filled with a solution of salt and water or with\r\ndiluted acid, to take the place of the wet plates of cloth, paper or\r\npasteboard. Cruikshanks’ plan was adopted in the construction of the\r\npowerful battery of 600 pairs, which Napoleon Bonaparte presented to\r\nthe Ecole Polytechnique and upon which Gay-Lussac and Thénard made\r\ntheir important experiments during the year 1808. As Noad remarks, it\r\nis a very convenient form when sulphate of copper is used, for Dr. Fyfe\r\nhas shown (_Phil. Mag._, Vol. XI. p. 145) that this exciting agent\r\nincreases the electro-chemical intensity of the electric current as\r\ncompared with that evolved by dilute sulphuric acid in the proportion\r\nof 72 to 16.\r\n\r\nBoth the above and Volta’s form of battery were much improved upon by\r\nDr. William Babington (1756–1833), who united the pairs of zinc and\r\ncopper plates by soldering them at one point, and by attaching them\r\nto a strip of wood in such a manner as to allow of the entire line\r\nbeing immersed at will into an earthenware or wooden trough having\r\na corresponding number of cells or partitions. The extraordinarily\r\nstrong voltaic battery, constructed in 1808 for the Royal Institution\r\nof London, by Mr. Eastwick under the direction of Sir Humphry Davy and\r\nof John George Children, was built upon this plan. It consisted of 200\r\nseparate parts, each part being composed of ten double plates, in all\r\n2000 double plates of zinc and copper with a total surface of 128,000\r\nsquare inches, and the charge which William H. Pepys was accustomed\r\nto give it consisted of a mixture of 1168 parts of water, 108 parts\r\nnitrous acid, and 25 parts sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Wilkinson, “Elements of Galvanism,” 1804, Vol. II.\r\n   pp. 52–63, 96–99; Pepper, “Electricity,” 1809, pp. 313–315;\r\n   Noad, “Manual,” pp. 263, 264; Tomlinson, “Cyclopædia of Arts,”\r\n   Vol. I. p. 566; Napier, “Electro-Metallurgy,” 1853, pp. 27,\r\n   28; _Nicholson’s Journal_, Vol. IV. pp. 187, 254, 261 and\r\n   511; _Sturgeon’s Annals_, Vol. IX. p. 309; Cruikshanks, “Some\r\n   Experiments and Observations on Galvanic Electricity,” July\r\n   1800; also “Additional Remarks on Galvanic Electricity,”\r\n   September 1800.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1801.=--Davy (Humphry), a very eminent English chemical\r\nphilosopher, whose early studies had been greatly influenced\r\nboth by Dr. John Tonkin, of Penzance, and by Gregory Watt, son\r\nof the celebrated inventor, James Watt, as well as by Mr. Davies\r\nGiddy Gilbert, who brought him to the notice of the English Royal\r\nInstitution, delivers before the latter body, on the 25th of April\r\n1801, his first lecture, wherein he traces the history of galvanism,\r\nand describes the different methods of “accumulating” it.\r\n\r\nHis first communication to the Royal Society was made in June\r\nof the same year, and is entitled, “An Account of Some Galvanic\r\nCombinations Formed by the Arrangement of Single Metallic Plates and\r\nFluids, Analogous to the New Galvanic Apparatus of Volta.” As his\r\nable biographer, Prof. T. James Stewart Traill, M.D., of Edinburgh,\r\nremarks, this paper is the first of that series of electro-chemical\r\ninvestigations which have immortalized his name. In all hitherto\r\nconstructed piles, the series had consisted of not less than two\r\nmetals, or of one plate of metal, another of charcoal, and some\r\ninterposed fluid. He showed in this paper that the usual galvanic\r\nphenomena might be energetically exhibited by a single metallic\r\nplate and two strata of different fluids, or that a battery might\r\nbe constructed of one metal and two fluids, provided one of the\r\nfluids was capable of causing oxidation on one of the surfaces of the\r\nmetal (“Bakerian Lectures,” London, 1840, pp. 32, etc., and _Phil.\r\nTrans._, Vol. XCI. p. 297).\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of November 1806 was read before the Royal Society Davy’s\r\nfirst Bakerian lecture, “On Some Chemical Agencies of Electricity.”\r\nThis essay was universally regarded as one of the most valuable\r\ncontributions thus far made to chemistry, and obtained for Davy the\r\nprize founded by Napoleon when First Consul, to be awarded by the\r\nFrench Institute, “à celui, qui par ses expériences et ses découvertes,\r\nfera faire a l’électricité et au galvanisme un pas comparable à\r\ncelui qu’ont fait faire à ces sciences Franklin et Volta” (“Bakerian\r\nLectures,” 1840, p. 56, and notes at p. 349, Vol. I of Dr. Lardner’s\r\n“Lectures,” etc., 1859).\r\n\r\nOf the French Institute Davy became a member in 1817. Regarding the\r\nabove-named important paper, given in full at pp. 1–56, of the volume\r\nof “Bakerian Lectures,” already referred to, Davy says (_Phil.\r\nTrans._ for 1826, p. 389): “Referring to my experiments of 1800,\r\n1801 and 1802, and to a number of new facts, which showed that\r\ninflammable substances and oxygen, alkalies and acids, and oxidable and\r\nnoble metals, were in electrical relations of positive and negative,\r\nI drew the conclusion _that the combinations and decompositions by\r\nelectricity were referable to the law of electrical attractions and\r\nrepulsions_,” and advanced the hypothesis “_that chemical and\r\nelectrical attractions were produced by the same cause, acting in the\r\none case on particles; in the other on masses; ... and that the same\r\nproperty, under different modifications, was the cause of all the\r\nphenomena exhibited by different voltaic combinations_” (Vol. I.\r\npp. 678–684 of Dr. Thomas Young’s “Course of Lectures,” London, 1807,\r\non “Electricity in Motion,” also Dr. Henry M. Noad’s “Manual,” London,\r\n1859, pp. 362–365).\r\n\r\nThe second Bakerian lecture, “On some new phenomena of chemical changes\r\nproduced by electricity, particularly the decomposition of the fixed\r\nalkalies, and the exhibition of the new substances which constitute\r\ntheir bases; and on the general nature of alkaline bodies,” was read\r\nNov. 19, 1807. In this he gives an account of the most brilliant of\r\nall his discoveries (made during the previous month), proving that the\r\nso-called fixed alkalies are merely combinations of oxygen with metals.\r\nIt has been stated by Dr. John Ayrton Paris that since the days of\r\nNewton no such happy and successful instance of philosophical induction\r\nhas ever been afforded as that by which Davy reached the above-named\r\nresults (_Phil. Trans._ for 1808, Vol. XCVIII. pp. 1–44). Davy’s\r\nobservations were fully confirmed by Gay-Lussac, Thénard, Berzelius\r\nand Pontin (_Annales de Chimie_, Vol. LXXII. p. 193; Vol. LXXV.\r\npp. 256–291; _Bibl. Brit._ for June 1809, p. 122). Although Davy\r\nwas less successful in his attempt to decompose the proper earths, he\r\nproved that they consist of bases united to oxygen. It was reserved\r\nfor Friedrich Wöhler, Berzelius and Bussy to exhibit the bases by\r\nthemselves, and to show that all, excepting silica, are metallic, and\r\ncapable of uniting with iron.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the original 500-plate batteries of the Royal\r\nInstitution were so worn in the course of Davy’s experiments as to\r\nbe almost unserviceable, and that he suggested to the managers the\r\npropriety of starting a subscription for the purchase of a large\r\ngalvanic battery. This being acted upon during the month of July 1808,\r\nhe was placed in possession of the battery already alluded to in the\r\nCruikshanks article (A.D. 1800), and which was the most powerful\r\nconstructed up to that time. “With this battery Davy did not reach\r\nany new results of importance; but he was enabled to demonstrate\r\nthe galvanic phenomena upon a more brilliant scale. Nor was the\r\nincreased power necessary to carry on successfully the experiments on\r\nthe decomposition of the alkalies and the earths as was apparently\r\nbelieved by many of those historians of science ... who attributed the\r\nauthor’s brilliant success in electro-chemical research to his supposed\r\nextraordinary means, the enormous voltaic batteries of the Royal\r\nInstitution.” In this connection, the terse notes appearing at foot of\r\npp. 62, 63, 106, 107 of the 1840 edition of the “Bakerian Lectures”\r\nwill prove interesting reading.\r\n\r\nIt was with the afore-named galvanic combination that Davy openly\r\nmade--in 1809–1810, and not in 1813, as has been frequently stated--the\r\nfirst display of the continuous electric arc (John Davy, “Memoirs of\r\nthe Life of Sir Humphry Davy,” p. 446).\r\n\r\n“When the cells of this battery were filled with sixty parts of water\r\nmixed with one part of nitric acid and one part of sulphuric acid,”\r\nhe says, “they afforded a series of brilliant and impressive effects.\r\nWhen pieces of charcoal about an inch long and one-sixth of an inch in\r\ndiameter were brought near each other (within the thirtieth or fortieth\r\npart of an inch), a bright spark was produced, and more than half the\r\nvolume of the charcoal became ignited to whiteness, and by withdrawing\r\nthe points from each other a constant discharge took place through the\r\nheated air, in a space equal at least to four inches, producing a most\r\nbrilliant ascending arch of light, broad and conical in form in the\r\nmiddle. When any substance was introduced into this arch, it instantly\r\nbecame ignited; platina melted as readily in it as wax in the flame\r\nof a common candle; quartz, the sapphire, magnesia, lime, all entered\r\ninto fusion; fragments of diamond, and points of charcoal and plumbago,\r\nrapidly disappeared, and seemed to evaporate in it, even when the\r\nconnection was made in a receiver exhausted by the air pump; but there\r\nwas no evidence of their having previously undergone fusion” (“Elements\r\nof Chemical Philosophy,” 1812, p. 154).\r\n\r\nDr. Paris says that Davy had already produced the spark upon a small\r\nscale as far back as 1800 (_Nicholson’s Journal_, Vol. III, quarto,\r\np. 150), and we learn, through an article published upon the early\r\nexperiments with the electric light, the names of others who had\r\nlikewise noticed the arc at about the same period, while Quetelet\r\ninforms us that M. Curtet is reported to have observed the light\r\nbetween carbon points during the year 1802 (Curtet’s letter to J. B.\r\nVan Mons in the latter’s _Journal de Chimie_, No. VI. p. 272, and in\r\n_Journal de Physique_, An. XI. p. 54). The article referred to is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“Dr. S. P. Thompson has given the following interesting details in\r\nregard to this subject: In looking over an old volume of the _Journal\r\nde Paris_, I found, under date of the Twenty-second Ventose, An. X\r\n(March 12, 1802), this passage, which evidently refers to an exhibition\r\nof the electric arc: ‘Citizen (E. G.) Robertson, the inventor of\r\nthe phantasmagoria (magic lantern), is at present performing some\r\ninteresting experiments that must doubtless advance our knowledge\r\nconcerning galvanism. He has just mounted metallic piles to the number\r\nof 2500 zinc plates and as many of rosette copper. We shall forthwith\r\nspeak of his results, as well as of a new experiment that he performed\r\nyesterday with two glowing carbons. The first having been placed at\r\nthe base of a column of 120 zinc and silver elements, and the second\r\ncommunicating with the apex of the pile, they gave at the moment they\r\nwere united a brilliant spark of an extreme whiteness that was seen by\r\nthe entire society. Citizen Robertson will repeat the experiment on the\r\n25th.’”\r\n\r\nThe date generally given for this discovery by Humphry Davy is 1809,\r\nbut earlier accounts of his experiments are found in Cuthbertson’s\r\n“Electricity” (1807), and in several other works.\r\n\r\nIn the _Phil. Mag._, Vol. IX. p. 219, under date of Feb. 1, 1801,\r\nin a memoir by Dr. H. Moyes, of Edinburgh, relative to experiments\r\nmade with the pile, we find the following passage: “When the column\r\nin question had reached the height of its power, its sparks were\r\nseen by daylight, even when they were made to jump with a piece of\r\ncarbon held in the hand.” In the same volume of the _Phil. Mag._,\r\nand immediately following Dr. Moyes’ letter to Dr. Garthshore, on\r\nexperiments with the voltaic pile, will be found an account of similar\r\ninvestigations made in Germany, and communicated by Dr. Frulander, of\r\nBerlin.\r\n\r\nIn the “Journal of the Royal Institution” (1802), Vol. I. p. 106, Davy\r\ndescribes a few experiments made with the pile, and says: “When instead\r\nof metals, pieces of well-calcined carbon were employed, the spark\r\nwas still larger and of a clear white.” On p. 214 he describes and\r\nfigures an apparatus for taking the galvano-electric spark into fluid\r\nand aeriform substances. This apparatus consisted of a glass tube open\r\nat the top, and having at the side another tube through which passed a\r\nwire that terminated in a carbon. Another wire, likewise terminating in\r\ncarbon, traversed the bottom, and was cemented in a vertical position.\r\n\r\nBut all these observations are subsequent to a letter printed in\r\n“Nicholson’s Journal” for October 1800, p. 150, entitled “Additional\r\nexperiments on Galvanic Electricity in a letter to Mr. Nicholson.” The\r\nletter is dated Dowry Square, Hotwells, Sept. 22, 1800, and is signed\r\nby Humphry Davy, who at this epoch was assistant to Dr. Beddoes at the\r\nPhilosophical (Pneumatic) Institution of Bristol. It begins thus:\r\n\r\n“Sir: The first experimenters in animal electricity remarked the\r\nproperty that well calcined carbon has of conducting ordinary galvanic\r\naction. I have found that this substance possesses the same properties\r\nas metallic bodies for the production of the spark when it is used for\r\nestablishing a communication between the extremities of Signor Volta’s\r\npile.”\r\n\r\nAmong the papers read by Davy before the Royal Society between June\r\n30, 1808, and Feb. 13, 1814, are the following: “Electro-chemical\r\nresearches on the decomposition of the earths, with observations on the\r\nmetals obtained from the alkaline earths, and on the amalgam procured\r\nfrom ammonia”; “An account of some new analytical researches on the\r\nnature of certain bodies,” etc., and the Bakerian lecture “On some\r\nnew electro-chemical researches, on various objects, particularly the\r\nmetallic bodies from the alkalies and earths, and on some combinations\r\nof hydrogen”; “Elements of chemical philosophy, detailing experiments\r\non electricity in vegetation.”\r\n\r\nIn alluding to the important subjects covered by him during the\r\nabove-named period, his brother and biographer, John Davy, M.D.,\r\nF.R.S., says: “I shall not attempt an analysis of these papers; I\r\nshall give merely a sketch of the most important facts and discoveries\r\nwhich they contain, referring the chemical reader to the original for\r\nfull satisfaction. After the extraction of metallic bases from the\r\nfixed alkalies, analogies of the strongest kind indicated that the\r\nalkaline earths are similarly constituted; and he succeeded in proving\r\nthis in a satisfactory manner. But, owing to various circumstances of\r\npeculiar properties, he was not able on his first attempts to obtain\r\nthe metals of those earths in a tolerably pure and insulated state\r\nfor the purpose of examination. On his return to the laboratory after\r\nhis illness, this was one of the first undertakings. He accomplished\r\nit to a certain extent by uniting a process of Messrs. Berzelius and\r\nPontin, who were then engaged in the same enquiry, with one of his own.\r\nBy negatively electrifying the earths, slightly moistened, and mixed\r\nwith red oxide of mercury, in contact with a globule of mercury, he\r\nobtained amalgams of their metallic bases; and, by distillation, with\r\npeculiar precautions, he expelled the greater part of the mercury.\r\nEven now, in consequence of the very minute quantities of the bases\r\nwhich he procured, and their very powerful attraction for oxygen,\r\nhe was only able to ascertain a few of their properties in a hasty\r\nmanner. They were of silvery lustre, solid at ordinary temperatures,\r\nfixed at a red heat, and heavier than water. At a high temperature\r\nthey abstracted oxygen from the glass, and, at ordinary temperatures,\r\nfrom the atmosphere and water, the latter of which in consequence they\r\ndecomposed. The names he proposed for them, and by which they have\r\nsince been called, were barium, strontium, calcium and magnium, which\r\nlatter he afterwards altered to magnesium....”\r\n\r\nThe reviewer of Davy, in the columns of the “Chemical News,” writing in\r\n1879, states that his papers on numerous subjects flowed into the Royal\r\nSociety’s archives in an uninterrupted stream, and it may be said,\r\nwithout exaggeration, that his work, especially during the six years\r\nfrom 1806 to 1812, did more for chemistry than the 60 which followed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBetween the last-named dates, Davy was asked by the Dublin Society\r\nto give a course of lectures on electro-chemical science, which he\r\ndelivered Nov. 8–29, 1810. Trinity College afterward conferred on him\r\nthe degree of LL.D., and he was knighted by the Prince Regent one\r\nday before resigning from the Royal Institution, wherein he gave his\r\nfarewell address on April 9, 1812.\r\n\r\nIn 1813, accompanied by his bride and Mr. Faraday (his “assistant\r\nin experiments and in writing”), Davy made his first trip to the\r\nContinent, where he met Ampère, Humboldt, Gay-Lussac, Vauquelin,\r\nCuvier, Laplace and other distinguished scientists, and where\r\nhe carried on many experiments, of which the results were duly\r\ncommunicated to the Royal Society, as were also the observations made\r\nby him up to the time of the completion of his second trip in 1820.\r\n\r\nBesides the Rumford medal conferred on him in 1816, he received a\r\nbaronetcy two years later, and was given, in 1827, the medal of the\r\nRoyal Society, the presidential chair of which he occupied for seven\r\nconsecutive years.\r\n\r\nOne of the four memoirs produced by Davy in 1818–1829 treats of\r\nelectro-magnetism. In 1820, Davy, Arago and Seebeck independently\r\ndiscovered the magnetizing power of the electric current on steel\r\nand iron needles or filings. In Davy’s experiments, it is said,\r\nthe filings adhered to the wire connecting the poles of a voltaic\r\napparatus, consisting of a hundred pairs of plates of four inches, in\r\nsuch considerable quantities as to form a mass around it ten or twelve\r\ntimes the thickness of the wire (_Phil. Trans._ for 1821, p. 9;\r\n_Annales de Chimie et de Physique_, Vol. XV. p. 93).\r\n\r\nDavy was actively engaged during 1821–1822 in experiments on\r\nelectro-magnetism and on electricity in vacuo, reaching the conclusion,\r\nin the last-named channel, that electric light as well as electrical\r\nattractions and repulsions are observable in the most perfect vacuum\r\nobtainable. This is readily demonstrated with either the apparatus\r\nemployed by Tyndall in his Lecture VIII, “On the analogies of light,\r\nheat and sound,” or with the apparatus used by Davy and illustrated at\r\nPlate CCXXIII of the “Encyclopædia Britannica,” eighth edition. From\r\nthe numerous experiments and observations recorded in the last-named\r\nwork the following are extracted:\r\n\r\n“A spark capable of passing through only half an inch in common air\r\nwill pass through six inches of the Torricellian vacuum.... When the\r\nminutest quantity of rare air was introduced into the mercurial vacuum,\r\nthe colour of the electric light changed from bright _green_ to _sea\r\ngreen_, and by increasing the quantity, to _blue_ and _purple_. At a\r\nlow temperature the vacuum became a much better conductor. A vacuum\r\nabove fused tin exhibited nearly the same phenomena. At temperatures\r\nbelow zero the light was yellow and of the palest phosphorescent kind,\r\njust visible in great darkness, and not increased by heat. When the\r\nvacuum was formed by pure olive oil and by chloride of antimony, the\r\nelectric light through the vapour of the chloride was more brilliant\r\nthan that through the vapour of the oil; and in the last it was more\r\nbrilliant than in the vapour of mercury at common temperatures. The\r\nlight was of a _pure white_ with the chloride, and of a _red_ inclining\r\nto _purple_ in the oil.... In carbonic acid gas the light of the spark\r\nis white and brilliant, and in hydrogen gas it is red and faint. When\r\nthe sparks are made to pass through balls of wood or ivory they are\r\nof a _crimson_ colour. They are _yellow_ when taken over powdered\r\ncharcoal, _green_ over the surface of silvered leather, and _purple_\r\nfrom imperfect conductors.”\r\n\r\nDavy’s Bakerian lecture for 1826 was entitled “On the relation of\r\nelectrical and chemical changes.” Two years previous to its reading\r\nhe had communicated to the English Government his discovery of what\r\nhe erroneously considered a remedy against the rapid deterioration\r\nof copper sheathing for ships. His plan consisted in altering the\r\nelectrical condition of the copper by adding plates of zinc or iron\r\n(called “protectors”), but the bottoms of the vessels became so foul\r\nthrough the deposition of calcareous matter and the adhesion of large\r\nbalani and lepades, etc., to the copper, that the attempt had to be\r\nabandoned (A. Bobierre, “Thèse ... pour doubler les navires,” Nantes,\r\n1858). It was in the same year (1824) that Davy made an important\r\njourney through Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Holstein, and Hanover, during\r\nwhich he met Oersted, Berzelius, Gauss, Olbers, Schumacher and other\r\nsavants.\r\n\r\nHis last communication to the Royal Society, “Remarks on the\r\nElectricity of the _Torpedo_,” was sent from Rome in 1828, one year\r\nbefore his death, and embodies the result of many observations made\r\nwhile on the Continent, more especially during the years 1814–1815.\r\nThe investigations in this line which, owing to continued ill health,\r\nhe was unable to carry on, were completed by his brother, Dr. John\r\nDavy, who established the following points of difference between the\r\nphenomena of the _torpedo_ and those of other kinds of electricity:\r\n\r\n“Compared with voltaic electricity, its effect on the multiplier is\r\nfeeble: its power of decomposing water and metallic solutions is\r\ninconsiderable; but its power of giving a shock is great, and so also\r\nis its power of magnetizing iron. Compared with common electricity,\r\nit has a power of affecting the multiplier, which, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, common electricity does not exhibit; its chemical\r\neffects are more distinct; its power of magnetizing iron and giving\r\na shock appears very similar; its power of passing through air is\r\ninfinitely less as is also (if it possess it at all) the power of\r\nproducing heat and light.”\r\n\r\nDavy likewise made noteworthy observations concerning the\r\npyro-electricity of the tourmaline, confirming previous investigations\r\nin the same line, and asserting that “when the stone is of considerable\r\nsize, flashes of light may be seen along its surface” (“Elements\r\nof Chemical Philosophy,” Vol. I. p. 130), a curious fact which Sir\r\nDavid Brewster says he does not believe has ever been verified by any\r\nsubsequent observer.\r\n\r\nIt is not within the scope of this “Bibliographical History” to\r\ndescribe Davy’s other notable papers relative to the miner’s safety\r\nlamp, etc., but reference should be made here to his first scientific\r\nmemoir, “On heat, light and the combination of light” (Sir H. Davy’s\r\nworks, Vol. II) of which copious extracts are given by Prof. John\r\nTyndall in the appendix to his third lecture on “Heat considered as a\r\nmode of motion.”\r\n\r\nAs regards the caloric theory, which had deservedly been engaging\r\nthe attention of so many scientists, it is, however, thought best\r\nto quote here from Deschanel’s article on thermo-dynamics: “Strange\r\nto say, this theory survived the many exposures of its weakness and\r\nthe, if possible, still more conclusive experiment of Sir Humphry\r\nDavy, who showed that two pieces of ice, when rubbed together, were\r\nconverted into water, a change which involves not the evolution but the\r\nabsorption of latent heat, and which cannot be explained by diminution\r\nof thermal capacity, since the specific heat of water is much greater\r\nthan that of ice. Davy, like Rumford, maintained that heat consisted\r\nin motion, and the same view was maintained by Dr. Thomas Young;\r\nbut the doctrine of caloric nevertheless continued to be generally\r\nadopted until about the year 1840, since which time the experiments of\r\nJoule, the eloquent advocacy of Meyer, and the mathematical deductions\r\nof Thomson, Rankine and Clausius, have completely established the\r\nmechanical theory of heat, and built up an accurate science of\r\nthermo-dynamics.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“The Life of Sir H.

During\r\nthis memorable voyage he carefully observed the cause of errors in\r\nthe variation of the magnetic needle as depending on the direction in\r\nazimuth of the ship’s head, having often noticed, as a writer in the\r\nEnglish _Quarterly Review_ expresses it (Vol. CXVIII. p. 343), that the\r\ndirection of the compass needle frequently wandered from that which the\r\nknown variation due to the geographical position of the ship assigned\r\nto it. To correct those disturbances he suggested placing aft of the\r\ncompass a vertical bar of soft iron, whose upper end, having like\r\nmagnetism as the imaginary mass in the ship’s head, would, in acting on\r\nthe opposite pole of the compass needle, rectify its disturbances.\r\n\r\nFlinders had, during the year 1795, made observations in the same line\r\nas those recorded by the astronomer Bayly, who had sailed with Captain\r\nCook during his last two voyages, but it was not until his return from\r\nthe unfortunate first voyage above alluded to that he properly recorded\r\nhis investigations for the benefit of navigators.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Encyclopædia Britannica,” 1856, Vol. X. p. 295,\r\n   and article “Australia,” Vol. IV. pp. 253, 254; “English\r\n   Cyclopædia” (Biography), Vol. II. pp. 933–935; _Sci.

Gautherot says that the results he obtained should become the\r\nsource or basis of several other experiments, and concur more than any\r\nother to the discovery of the theory of this new branch of physics.\r\n\r\nIn this same year Gautherot observed the power of adhesion of the\r\ntwo wires in contact with the upper and lower ends of the pile, a\r\nreport upon which appears at p. 209, Vol. XXXIX of the _Annales de\r\nChimie_, while a full account of his observations on the subject\r\nforms the substance of a separate work printed in London during the\r\nyear 1828.\r\n\r\nThe French physicist, C. J. Lehot, makes allusion to the last-named\r\ndiscovery in the following words, at p. 4 of his pamphlet entitled\r\n“Observations sur le Galvanisme et le Magnétisme”:\r\n\r\n“It has long been known that the two wires which terminate a pile\r\nattract one another, and, after contact, adhere like two magnets.\r\nThis attraction between the two wires, one of which receives, and the\r\nother loses, the galvanic fluid, differs essentially from electrical\r\nattraction, as Ritter observed, since it is not followed by a repulsion\r\nafter contact, but continues as long as the chain is closed.”\r\n\r\nJ. J. Fahie, who also quotes this passage, says:\r\n\r\n“The discovery in question seems to have been made independently,\r\nand at about the same time by Gautherot (_Philosophical Magazine_ or\r\n_Annals_ for 1828, Vol. IV. p. 458), by P. S. Laplace, and by J. B.\r\nBiot (_Journal de Physique et de Chimie_, for 1801, Vol. LIII. p. 266).\r\nThe latter made the further very acute observation that, if the wires\r\nare attached to plates of metal, and these plates approached by their\r\nedges, they will attract one another; while if approached by their\r\nfaces no action whatever takes place. For other interesting experiments\r\nof this kind see ‘Nicholson’s Journal’ for 1804, Vol. VII. p. 304.”\r\n\r\nPrevious to the aforesaid discoveries, on the 12th Brumaire, An. IX\r\n(Nov. 1800), Gautherot had published his refutation of Volta’s contact\r\ntheory, through the Paris “Société Philotechnique,” and it is to be\r\nfound recorded at p. 471, Vol. I of the “Mémoires des Sociétés Savantes\r\net Littéraires de la République Française.”\r\n\r\nLater on he devoted so much attention to galvanic researches that\r\nMessrs. A. F. de Fourcroy and L. N. Vauquelin made a special report\r\nupon the five important memoirs containing the results of his many\r\nobservations to the French Institute on the 21st Fructidor.\r\n\r\nThe first memoir gives the whole theory and practice of the various\r\nkinds of conductors, and describes an apparatus devised by Gautherot to\r\nascertain the conducting powers of different natural, solid, liquid and\r\neven gaseous bodies (Izarn, “Manuel du Galvanisme” 1804, pp. 56–60). He\r\nenters into full details as to the effects of the voltaic pile in many\r\nexperiments made upon himself, and draws consequences which apparently\r\ndisprove the identity of the electric and the galvanic fluids.\r\n\r\nThe second memoir treats of the galvanic properties of charcoal, and\r\nshows that it is a less perfect conductor than are metallic substances.\r\n\r\nIn the third memoir he makes known his discovery that charcoal and zinc\r\nform a galvanic apparatus which will produce shocks, the decomposition\r\nof water, etc. He observes “that in the decomposition of water,\r\ncharcoal decomposes that fluid in the same way with non-oxydable\r\nmetals; or, in other words, that when two pieces of charcoal are\r\nemployed for this purpose, one of them disengages the hydrogen gas, and\r\nthe other the oxygen ... when the portions of charcoal touch each other\r\nin the water, its decomposition is not stopped on that account, as\r\nhappens when metallic substances are brought in contact under the same\r\ncircumstances. Indeed, if to bring more immediately together, one of\r\nthe pieces of charcoal be cut in a furcated shape, this does not become\r\nan obstacle to the decomposition of the water.”\r\n\r\nThe fourth memoir treats further of different kinds of conductors, and\r\nof various methods of constructing galvanic columns.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth and last memoir, Gautherot relates his important discovery\r\nthat an effective galvanic apparatus can be made without metals.\r\nHe constructed one of forty layers of charcoal and plumbago, which\r\ncommunicated a strong and pungent taste, accompanied by the galvanic\r\nflash of light, and which finally produced the decomposition of water,\r\nthe charcoal side disengaging the hydrogen gas (Izarn, “Manuel du\r\nGalvanisme,” 1804, p. 177).\r\n\r\nDuring the month of March 1803, he read before the “Institut National”\r\na memoir entitled “Recherches,” etc. (researches upon the causes which\r\ndevelop electricity in the galvanic apparatus). This appeared in the\r\n_Journal de Physique_, Vol. LVI. p. 429.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Biographie Générale,” Vol. XIX. p. 694; Larousse,\r\n   “Dict.

VIII, and which appeared in the _Annales de Chimie_ (Vol. XXXVII.\r\np. 132), as well as in the “Mémoires Récréatifs, Scientifiques,” etc.,\r\npublished in Paris during 1840, three years after Robertson’s death.\r\n\r\nRobertson states that as he was delivering a lecture on the 9th\r\nVendémaire, An. IX, during which he alluded to differences which\r\nhe found to exist between the galvanic and electric fluids, he was\r\ninterrupted by Prof. Brugnatelli, who stated that Volta, who was then\r\npresent, desired an opportunity to correct the wrong impressions\r\nthe lecturer laboured under. Volta called upon him early the day\r\nfollowing and brought a live frog as well as apparatus, with which\r\nthey experimented quite extensively, and the results of which brought\r\nRobertson completely over to the views of the Italian scientist.\r\nVolta frequently repeated his visits, which led to the development\r\nof a lasting friendship between the two. They visited together\r\nall the prominent scientific bodies, such as l’Ecole de Médecine,\r\nl’Ecole Polytechnique, etc., but found to their great astonishment\r\nthat Robertson was the only one in Paris who had as yet given the\r\nnew discovery any serious attention. At pp. 250–253, Vol. I of his\r\n“Mémoires,” etc., will be found a full account of the above as well as\r\nof the very indifferent reception first given them by the celebrated\r\nProf. Charles.\r\n\r\nRobertson adds (p. 256 of last-named work) that he was asked by Volta\r\nto witness the latter’s notable experiments made before the members of\r\nthe National Institute of France, Nov. 16, 18, 20, 1800, and already\r\nalluded to herein at A.D. 1775. The sessions of that body were being\r\nheld at the time in the Palais du Louvre, and the excitement caused\r\nby the meetings was so great that all the approaches were guarded by\r\nsoldiery. After Prof. Volta had explained his theory and alluded to the\r\nidentity of electricity and galvanism, he announced that Robertson had\r\nfirst illustrated the fact, and he asked him to repeat his original\r\nexperiment, which the latter did after the necessary hydrogen gas had\r\nbeen procured from the neighbouring cabinet of Prof. Charles.\r\n\r\nRobertson is also the author of several other interesting memoirs\r\non the electrophorus, the improved “couronne de tasses” and “acide\r\ngalvanique” which can be found in Vol. XXXVII of the _Journal de\r\nPhysique_ and in the _Journal de Paris_ for the year 1800 (“Recueil des\r\nActes de la Soc. de Lyon,” Tome II. p. 370).\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1801.=--Gerboin (A. C.), Professor at the Medical School of\r\nStrasbourg, is the first to report upon the peculiar agitation of\r\nmercury when the voltaic current passes through it.\r\n\r\nHe states, in his “Recherches expérimentales sur un nouveau mode de\r\nl’action électrique” (Strasbourg, 1808), that his many researches\r\nwere instigated by the observation he had made during the winter of\r\n1798, while in company with some friends watching a child play with a\r\nhollow wooden ball. The Italian physicist, Abbate Fortis (1740–1803),\r\nwho wrote several works on natural philosophy, but who is best known\r\nby his “Viaggio di Dalmazia,” had already announced that a pyritical\r\ncube suspended by a thread held between the thumb and index would\r\nimmediately, without any movement of the fingers, assume a circular\r\nmotion upon being approached by another body. The “Morgenblatt” of\r\nTübingen and the French “Archives Littéraires” render in 1807 a very\r\ncomplete account of Ritter’s researches upon the Fortis pendulum,\r\nand N. Meissas states, at pp. 181–187 of his “Nouveaux Eléments de\r\nPhysique,” Paris, 1838, that he repeated the experiment of Ritter and\r\nof his friend Gerboin and observed many very curious results. These he\r\nembodied in a communication during the month of April 1829 to Ampère,\r\nwho looked into Meissas’ work in company with M. Becquerel, also a\r\nmember of the French Institute.\r\n\r\nIn his experiments, Gerboin employed a tube bent in U[ symbol] form,\r\nfilled half full of mercury, which later was covered with a stratum\r\nof water, and he placed therein the wires connecting with a pile. The\r\nsurface of the mercury beneath the negative pole was slightly oxidized,\r\nbut the surface under the positive point moved so violently as to\r\ncause small bodies placed within to be thrown outward upon the surface\r\nof the tube. These bodies moved in a contrary direction, v from the\r\ncircumference toward the interior, if the positive pole was made to\r\ntouch the liquid metal.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Observations of M.

F. V. Delaunay, “Manuel,” etc., Paris, 1809).\r\n\r\nIn his “Traité,” Prof. Libes dispels the previous generally accepted\r\nbelief as to the production of electricity by pressure. Experiments\r\nmade by Æpinus and by Haüy had shown that such minerals as developed\r\npositive electricity by friction likewise exhibited the same\r\nelectricity by pressure, and that those furnishing resinous or negative\r\nelectricity by pressure developed the same electricity by friction.\r\n\r\nIt is known that varnished silk (_taffetas gommé_) acquires\r\nresinous electricity by ordinary friction, but Libes found the means of\r\ncausing it to develop vitreous or positive electricity. This is shown\r\nwhen a metallic disc insulated by a glass handle is _pressed_ upon\r\nthe silk; the latter will acquire positive electricity while the disc\r\nwill develop resinous or negative electricity. If, on the contrary, the\r\ndisc is _rubbed_ or _rolled_ upon the silk so as to produce\r\nfriction, the silk acquires resinous electricity and the disc vitreous\r\nor positive electricity. If a glass plate is substituted for the disc,\r\nthe silk again acquires vitreous electricity and the glass resinous\r\nelectricity, that is to say, they both develop contrary electricities\r\nto that furnished through ordinary rubbing.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Larousse, “Dict.

They thought that by\r\nusing many discs they could increase the force of the current and also\r\ndecompose water more rapidly, but found this was not the case, and that\r\nwith an enlarged pile the combustion of metallic wires was more rapid\r\nand brilliant, thus proving that the degree of combustion is relative\r\nto the surface of the plates (“Encyclopædia Britannica,” 1855, Vol.\r\nXXI. p. 626).\r\n\r\nThe grand experiment made conjointly by Fourcroy, Vauquelin and Seguin\r\non the composition of water from its constituent gases was commenced\r\nMay 13, 1790, and continued by them without intermission until its\r\ncompletion, nine days later. “The gases were fixed in a close vessel\r\nby means of electricity, and produced a nearly equal weight of water”\r\n(_Trans.

J.), French physicist, sends a curious and\r\nlengthy memoir, regarding the circulation of a very subtile fluid in\r\nthe galvanic chain, to the Institut National, before which body it is\r\nread on the 26 Frimaire, An. IX.\r\n\r\nTo the analyzation of the above-named memoir, Wilkinson devotes more\r\nthan half the tenth chapter of his “Elements of Galvanism,” calling\r\nattention to a very singular result from numerous experiments which\r\nis worthy of special mention. It is the possibility of actually\r\ndistinguishing one metal from another without seeing or feeling either\r\nof them, and he says that by his arrangement of the chain, M. Lehot\r\nwas able to recognize a portion of zinc from a piece of silver, at the\r\nextremity of metallic threads several yards in length.\r\n\r\nLehot’s contributions to the science of animal electricity are too\r\nnumerous to be given here. Noad summarizes them in the translation from\r\npp. 17, 18 of C. Matteucci’s “Traité des phénomènes ...” Paris, 1844.\r\n\r\nHe ascertained that in a recently killed animal contractions are\r\nexcited by the electric current in whatever direction it may be\r\napplied, but, when the vitality of the animal has become diminished,\r\nif the current is sent in the direction of the ramifications of the\r\nnerves, contractions are produced only at the _commencement_ of\r\nthe current; the reverse takes place when the current is directed\r\ncontrary to the ramifications of the nerves; _i. e._ in this\r\ncase the contractions only take place when the current ceases. After\r\nstudying the sensation excited by the current on the organs of taste,\r\nLehot concluded that the current which traverses a nerve in the\r\ndirection of its ramifications excites a sensation when it ceases to\r\npass, though this influence is only exerted at the _commencement_\r\nof its passage when the nerve is traversed in a direction contrary to\r\nits ramifications. The later experiments of Carlo Francesco Bellingeri\r\nand Stefano Giovanni Marianini entirely confirm those of Lehot.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Annales de Chimie_, Vol. XXXVIII. p. 42; _Journal\r\n   de Physique_, An.

He concluded that the decomposition must depend\r\nupon duly proportioning the strength of the charge to the quantity of\r\nwater, and that the quantity exposed to its action at the surface of\r\ncommunication depends on the extent of that surface. He observes:\r\n\r\n“Having procured a small wire of fine gold, and given to it as fine a\r\npoint as I could, I inserted it into a capillary glass tube, and after\r\nhaving heated the tube so as to make it adhere to the point and cover\r\nit at every part, I gradually ground it down till, with a pocket lens,\r\nI could discern that the point of gold was disclosed. I coated several\r\nwires in this manner, and found that when sparks from a conductor were\r\nmade to pass through water by means of a point so guarded, a spark\r\npassing to the distance of ⅛ of an inch would decompose water, when\r\nthe point did not exceed ¹⁄₇₀₀ of an inch in diameter. With another\r\npoint, which I estimated at ¹⁄₁₅₀₀, a succession of sparks ¹⁄₂₀ of an\r\ninch in length afforded a current of small bubbles of air. With a still\r\nfiner filament of gold, the mere current of electricity, without any\r\nperceptible sparks, evolved gas from water.”\r\n\r\nIn his Bakerian lecture of Nov. 20, 1806, Sir Humphry Davy relates\r\nexperiments made after the manner contrived by Wollaston, showing\r\nthat the principle of action is the same in common as in voltaic\r\nelectricity. Dr. Robert Hare, in a paper read before the Academy of\r\nNatural Sciences, “On the Objections to the Theories Severally of\r\nFranklin, Dufay and Ampère,” etc., says that, instead of proving the\r\nidentity of galvanism with frictional electricity, the above-named\r\nexperiments show that in one characteristic at least there is a\r\ndiscordancy, but that at the same time they possibly “indicate that\r\nethereal may give rise to ethereo-ponderable undulations.” Noad remarks\r\nthat in these ingenious experiments true electro-chemical decomposition\r\nwas not effected; that is, “the law which regulates the transference\r\nand the final place of the evolved bodies had no influence.” The water\r\nwas decomposed at both poles independently of each other, and the\r\noxygen and hydrogen gases evolved at the wires are the elements of the\r\nwater before existing in those places. Faraday observes:\r\n\r\n“That the poles, or rather points, have no mutual decomposing\r\ndependence, may be shown by substituting a wire or the finger for one\r\nof them, a change which does not at all interfere with the other,\r\nthough it stops all action at the charged pole. This fact may be\r\nobserved by turning the machine for some time; for though bubbles will\r\nrise from the point left unaltered in quantity sufficient to cover\r\nentirely the wire used for the other communication, if they could be\r\napplied to it, yet not a single bubble will appear on that wire.”\r\n\r\nWollaston communicated a paper to the Royal Society (_Phil.\r\nTrans._, Vol. XCI. p. 427) showing that the oxidation of the\r\nmetal is the primary cause of the electrical phenomena obtained in\r\nthe voltaic pile. The oxidating power is finely shown by his eighth\r\nexperiment, which he thus describes:\r\n\r\n“Having coloured a card with a strong infusion of litmus, I passed a\r\ncurrent of electric sparks along it, by means of two fine gold points,\r\ntouching it at the distance of an inch from each other. The effect, as\r\nin other cases, depending on the smallness of the quantity of water,\r\nwas most discernible when the card was nearly dry. In this state a very\r\nfew turns of the machine were sufficient to occasion a redness at the\r\npositive wire, very manifest to the naked eye. The negative wire, being\r\nafterward placed on the same spot, soon restored it to its original\r\nblue colour.”\r\n\r\nHe verified in 1802 the laws of double refraction in Iceland spar\r\nannounced by Huyghens, and wrote a treatise thereon which was read\r\nbefore the Royal Society on the 24th of June, and which contains\r\nadditional evidence deduced from Dr. Wollaston’s superior mode of\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nHe is said to have been the first to propose forming the spectrum by\r\nusing a very narrow pencil of daylight instead of sunlight, and to\r\nhave first made an accurate examination of the electric light. In his\r\ncommunication to the Philosophical Transactions for 1802 he says:\r\n\r\n“When the object viewed is a _blue_ line of electric light, I\r\nhave found the spectrum to be separated into several images; but the\r\nphenomena are somewhat different from the preceding (viz. the spectrum\r\nof the blue portion of the flame of a candle). It is, however, needless\r\nto describe minutely appearances which vary according to the brilliancy\r\nof the light, and which I cannot undertake to explain.”\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1815, Wollaston made a great improvement in the\r\nconstruction of voltaic batteries. Having observed that the power\r\nof a battery is much increased with a corresponding economy in zinc\r\nplates, when both zinc surfaces are opposed to a surface of copper, he\r\ndevised what he called an _elementary galvanic battery_. Each couple\r\nof the latter is made up only of a plate of copper doubled up around a\r\nzinc plate from which it is kept apart by strips of cork or wood, and\r\nthe connecting strips of metal are attached to a wooden rod which is\r\nlowered or elevated when the battery is in or out of action. He found\r\nthat a properly mounted plate of zinc, one inch square, was more than\r\nsufficient to ignite a wire of platina ¹⁄₃₀₀₀ of an inch in diameter,\r\neven when the acid is very diluted (fifty parts of water to one of\r\nsulphuric acid).\r\n\r\nHe was a very careful workman, and in order to adapt his apparatus\r\nto the popular uses, he generally endeavoured to construct them upon\r\nthe most reduced scale (_dans des proportions très exigues_). He\r\nproduced platinum wire so extremely fine as to be almost imperceptible\r\nto the naked eye. It was estimated that 30,000 pieces of this wire,\r\nplaced side by side in contact, would not cover more than an inch; that\r\nit would take 150 pieces of this wire bound together to form a thread\r\nas thick as a filament of raw silk, and that a mile of this wire would\r\nnot weigh more than a grain. It may be well to add here that the wire\r\nmade with John Wennstrom’s sapphire plates, for delicate electrical\r\napparatus, is so fine that thirty-six miles of it, properly insulated\r\nfor Government use in torpedo experiments, measures only about five\r\ninches in length by three in diameter when wound upon a spool. The\r\nfibre used as carbon filaments in the incandescent lamps is scraped to\r\nan even thinness by being drawn through sapphire plates from ³⁰⁄₁₀₀₀ to\r\n⁴⁄₁₀₀₀ of an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe smallest battery that Wollaston formed of the above-described\r\nconstruction consisted of a thimble without its top, flattened until\r\nits opposite sides were about two-tenths of an inch asunder. The bottom\r\npart was then nearly one inch wide and the top about three-tenths, and\r\nas its length did not exceed nine-tenths of an inch, the plate of zinc\r\nto be inserted was less than three-fourths of an inch square (_Annals\r\nof Philosophy_, Vol. VI. p. 210).\r\n\r\nWe are also indebted to Dr. Wollaston for the first idea of the\r\npossibility of producing electro-magnetic rotations. Prof. Schweigger\r\nopposed the action of revolving magnetism upon the ground that if it\r\nwere true, a magnet might be made to revolve around the uniting wire,\r\nbut Faraday found experimentally not only that a magnet could be made\r\nto revolve round the uniting wire, but that a movable uniting wire\r\nmight be made to revolve around a magnet. (See Faraday’s “Experimental\r\nResearches,” Vol, II. pp. 159–162 for “Historical Statement Respecting\r\nElectro-magnetic Rotation.”)\r\n\r\nWollaston was made secretary of the Royal Society in 1806, became its\r\npresident in 1820 after the death of Sir Joseph Banks, and contributed\r\nin all thirty-eight memoirs to the _Philosophical Transactions_ of\r\nthat Institution.\r\n\r\nHis death occurred Dec. 22, 1828, and during the following February\r\nDr. Fitton, President of the Geological Society, concluded his annual\r\naddress with the following encomium:\r\n\r\n“It would be difficult to name a man who so well combined the qualities\r\nof an English gentleman and a philosopher, or whose life better\r\ndeserves the eulogium given by the first of our orators to one of our\r\nmost distinguished public characters; for it was marked by a constant\r\nwish and endeavour to be useful to mankind.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Phil.

We are apt to laugh at the _subtil matter_ of Descartes and\r\nthe _aether_ of Euler, as occult qualities, which modern philosophy\r\nwill not admit into its creed, but this effluvium is a _subtil_ matter,\r\nan _aether_, equally as inexplicable and as equally out of the reach of\r\nour five senses to scrutinize; however, if we may venture to guess at\r\ncauses by effects, and to compare analogies with what we can see, feel,\r\netc., I think we have infinite data in favour of an electro-magnetic\r\nfluid, superior to any proof that can be brought of æther being the\r\ncause of gravity, light, vision, etc.”\r\n\r\nJohn Read’s letter to the author concerning the _electrophorus_ appears\r\nat pp. 47–49 of the second volume (Poggendorff, Vol. II. pp. 1248–1249).\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1802.=--Alexandre (Jean), who is said to have been the natural\r\nson of Jean Jacques Rousseau, and to have studied for the medical\r\nprofession, operates his secret telegraph (_télégraphe intime_) at\r\nPoitiers, and afterwards addresses M. Chaptal, Ministre de l’Intérieur,\r\nasking for financial aid in order that he may be enabled to go to\r\nParis and submit his invention to the French Government. This request\r\nbeing refused on account of Alexandre’s unwillingness to divulge his\r\nsecret, he next obtained an audience of M. Cochon, Prefect of Vienne,\r\nbefore whom he demonstrated his invention so successfully that the\r\nlatter was induced to make a report of it to M. Chaptal, advising him\r\nto invite Alexandre to Paris at the expense of the State. A second\r\nrefusal, however, followed, and Alexandre went to Tours, where he there\r\nalso failed to obtain the desired assistance, after giving successful\r\nexhibitions of his telegraph before the Prefect of Indre-et-Loire,\r\nGeneral Rommereul, as well as before the Mayor and the city officials.\r\n\r\nThe substance of Prefect Cochon’s communication is to be found\r\ntranslated at pp. 111–113 of Fahie’s “History of Electric Telegraphy,”\r\nwhich latter also contains a full translation of the report addressed,\r\n10 Fructidor, An. X by the celebrated French astronomer, J. B.\r\nJ. Delambre, to the First Consul, suggesting for the inventor’s\r\nrepresentative, M. Beauvais, an interview which Bonaparte, however,\r\nrefused to grant.\r\n\r\nAlexandre died, 1832–1833, without having revealed his secret to\r\nany one but M. Beauvais. It is stated by Fahie that in the English\r\n_Chronicle_ of June 19–22, 1802, appears a brief account of the\r\nabove-named exhibition given at Tours, concluding as follows: “The art\r\nor mechanism by which this is effected is unknown, but the inventor\r\nsays that he can extend it to the distance of four or five leagues,\r\neven though a river should be interposed.” A copy of the above-named\r\nnewspaper, doubtless unique, was in Latimer Clark’s library.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Annales Télégraphiques,” March-April, 1859, pp.\r\n   188–199, for M.

He gilded two large\r\nsilver medals on bringing them in communication, by means of the steel\r\nwire, with the negative pole of a voltaic pile, and by keeping them\r\none after the other immersed in ammoniurets of gold newly prepared and\r\nwell saturated (_Phil. Mag._ for 1805).\r\n\r\nHe also electro-deposited bright metallic silver upon platinum, and\r\nobserved that when the current entered the liquid by means of a pole\r\nof copper or zinc, those metals were dissolved and then deposited upon\r\nthe negative pole. Spon tells us (“Dictionary of Engineering,” London,\r\n1874, Vol. II. p. 1378) that the solutions employed by Brugnatelli were\r\nalkaline; they consisted of ammoniurets of gold, silver or platina,\r\nthat is, the product obtained by treating the chlorides of gold and\r\nplatina or the azotate of silver, by ammonia. There is much obscurity\r\nin the descriptions of Brugnatelli, but according to the _Journal\r\nde Physique et Chimie_ of Van Mons, the most expeditious method of\r\nreducing, by means of the battery, dissolved metallic oxides, is to\r\nmake use of their ammoniurets by placing the ends of two conducting\r\nwires of platina into ammoniuret of mercury. The wire of the negative\r\npole speedily becomes covered with small particles of this metal. MM.\r\nBarral, Chevalier and Henri tried to reproduce Brugnatelli’s operation\r\nby following his descriptions, but with very imperfect results, the\r\nnature of the dissolvent employed by the learned Italian not being\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nAt p. 136, Vol. XVIII of his _Annali di Chimica_, etc., Brugnatelli\r\npublishes a memoir entitled “Chemical Observations on the Electric\r\nAcid.” He says:\r\n\r\n“Naturalists have hitherto merely abandoned one erroneous hypothesis\r\nfor another, in considering the nature of the electric fluid. Some\r\nhave regarded it as identical with heat; while others have been led to\r\nconsider it as a modified caloric. The disciples of Stahl ascribed it\r\nto the nature of their _phlogistic_ or, at least, supposed it to\r\nbe a fluid abundantly provided with that principle. Henley conjectured\r\nit to be phlogistic, when in a state of repose, and fire, when in a\r\nstate of activity. Among the moderns, several have been found who\r\nhave declared it to be an acid; but their opinion has been combated\r\nby Gardini, who, by means of several ingenious observations, has\r\nendeavoured to demonstrate that it is composed of caloric and hydrogen.”\r\n\r\nIn the earlier experiments on the decomposition of even chemically\r\npure water by the voltaic column, the presence of an acid was always\r\napparent at the pole evolving oxygen, while alkaline matter appeared at\r\nthe other (_Nicholson’s Journal_, quarto, Vol. IV. p. 183).\r\n\r\nMr. William Cruikshanks supposed the former to be the nitrous acid\r\nresulting from a combination of the oxygen at the positive pole with\r\nthe azote of the air held in solution by the water, while the alkali,\r\nhe said, proceeded from the combination of the same principle with the\r\nhydrogen evolved at the negative pole (_Nicholson’s Journal_, quarto,\r\nVol. IV. p. 261). Mr. C. B. Desormes afterward endeavoured to show that\r\nthe products were ammonia and muriatic acids (_Annales de Chimie_,\r\nVol. XXXVII. p. 233). Brugnatelli’s experiments with the _couronne de\r\ntasses_, however, led him to consider it to be an acid _sui generis_\r\nproduced by the combination of one of the constituents of water with\r\npositive electricity. He classed it as _oxi-electric_, and of all the\r\nmetals, gold and platina alone appeared to him not to be sensibly\r\naffected by this electric acid.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--For Brugnatelli’s record of other experiments\r\n   and observations and for his Memoirs upon different piles,\r\n   upon animal electricity, upon the identity of the electric and\r\n   galvanic fluids, etc. etc., see his “Principes,” etc., 1803,\r\n   and “Grundsätze des Elektricität,” etc., 1812, his _Annali\r\n   di Chimica_, Vols.

XII. pp. 123, 127; XIII. pp. 399–433; XXIII. pp.\r\n59–84, and LII. pp. 81–108.\r\n\r\nThe views of Jäger were fully endorsed by Berzelius, who, like Scholz\r\nand Reinhold, endeavoured to extend them, and who says that we are\r\nindebted to the German physicist for actually the most complete\r\nelucidation of the theory of the voltaic pile.\r\n\r\nIn Vol. XLIX of Gilbert’s _Annalen_ for 1815, pp. 47–66, will be\r\nfound Jäger’s observations and experiments on Zamboni’s column as well\r\nas the papers of Zamboni and Deluc on dry piles. Dr. Thomson says that\r\nsince Dr. Jäger found that, when the temperature was raised to 104\r\ndegrees, or as high as 140 degrees, the pile begins again to act as\r\nwell as ever, we must conclude from this that dry paper, while cold, is\r\na nonconductor of electricity, but that it becomes again a conductor\r\nwhen heated up to 104 degrees or 140 degrees.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Poggendorff, Vol. I. pp. 1186, 1187; “Catalogue of\r\n   Scientific Papers of the Royal Society,” Vol. III. p. 525; Jäger\r\n   on the tourmaline in Gilbert’s _Annalen_ for 1817, Vol. LV. pp.\r\n   369, 416, and Jäger, Bohnenberger and Zamboni in the _Annalen_\r\n   for 1819, Vol. LXII. pp. 227–246; Figuier, “Expos. et Histoire,”\r\n   1857, Vol. IV. p. 433; Davy, “Bakerian Lectures,” 1840, pp.\r\n   44–56, on the “Agencies of Electricity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1802.=--Gale (T.), an American physician, publishes at Troy\r\n“Electricity or Ethereal Fire ... considered naturally, astronomically\r\nand medically, and comprehending both the theory and practice of\r\nmedical electricity,” etc. Among other things, he describes at pp. 27,\r\n28, various experiments made with his galvanometer; explains at pp.\r\n46–64 how the Newtonian principles are erroneous; and shows at p. 264\r\nhow to extract lightning from the clouds; while at pp. 272, etc., are\r\ngiven directions for using electricity both as a sure preventive and\r\ncure of diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1802.=--Gibbes (George Smith), M.D., of Bath, reads before\r\nthe Royal Society a paper on the Phenomena of Galvanism thus noticed\r\nby Dr. Young at pp. 672, 673, Vol. II. of his “Course of Lectures,”\r\nLondon, 1707:\r\n\r\n“Dr. Gibbes begins with reciting some experiments on the oxidation\r\nproduced during the union of tinfoil with mercury, first in the air\r\nand then under water. He assumes a different opinion from that of\r\nDr. Wollaston, respecting the origination of electricity in chemical\r\nchanges, and maintains on the contrary that the electrical changes are\r\nto be considered as preceding and favouring the chemical. He imagines\r\nthat the simple contact of various substances produces changes of\r\nelectrical equilibrium, and that the action of acids is effectual in\r\npromoting these changes, by bringing their surfaces into contact. Dr.\r\nGibbes observes upon Dr. Wollaston’s experiment of immersing zinc and\r\nsilver in an acid solution, that if they are placed in two separate\r\nportions of the fluid, and the parts not immersed are brought into\r\ncontact there is no emission of gas from the silver; but that it is\r\ncopiously produced when the contact takes place in the same fluid. He\r\nproceeds to relate some experiments which seem to show a difference\r\nbetween galvanism and electricity, particularly that galvanism does not\r\nappear to be attracted by metallic points. He also states an experiment\r\nin which a piece of paper is placed on tinfoil, and rubbed with elastic\r\ngum, and although the tinfoil is not insulated, sparks are produced on\r\nraising the paper. Dr. Gibbes concludes with some arguments against\r\nthe doctrine of the decomposition of water; and advances as a probable\r\nopinion, that oxygen and hydrogen gas are composed of water as a basis,\r\nunited with two other elements, which, combined, form heat.”\r\n\r\nAs remarked by Wilkinson (“Elements of Galvanism,” London, 1804, Vol.\r\nII. pp. 385, 386), Dr. Gibbes’ hypothesis as to the composition of\r\nwater having been deduced from Richter’s experiments, and these latter\r\nproving erroneous, the ingenious superstructure which the doctor has\r\nerected must necessarily fall to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1802.=--Romagnosi (Gian Domenico Gregorio Giuseppe), Italian\r\njurist of Salsomaggiore, near Piacenza, who had devoted much time to\r\nscientific investigation, and was about taking the law professorship\r\nat the Parma University, communicates, Aug. 3, 1802, to the _Gazetta\r\ndi Trento_, his important paper entitled “Articulo sul Galvanismo.”\r\nOf the latter, a translation, made from the reprint at p. 8 of Gilb.\r\nGovi’s “Romagnosi e l’Elettro-magnetismo,” appears at pp. 259, 260 of\r\nFahie’s “History of Electric Telegraphy.”\r\n\r\nTo Romagnosi has by many been given the credit of having discovered\r\nthe directive influence of the galvanic current upon a magnetic\r\nneedle. This claim has of late years been again made for him, notably\r\nby Dr. Donato Tommasi, of Paris (_Cosmos, les Mondes_ of June\r\n30, 1883), while Dr. J. Hamel endeavoured to prove (pp. 37–39 of\r\n“Historical Account ... Galv. and Mag. Elec. ...” reprinted by W. F.\r\nCooke for the Society of Arts, London, 1859) that Oersted was aware\r\nof Romagnosi’s experiments at the time he published the discovery of\r\nelectro-magnetism. This is what Dr. Hamel says:\r\n\r\n“I cannot forego stating my belief that Oersted knew of Romagnosi’s\r\ndiscovery announced in 1802, which was eighteen years before the\r\npublication of his own observations. It was mentioned in the book of\r\nGiovanni Aldini (the nephew of Galvani) ... Oersted was in Paris 1802\r\nand 1803, and it appears from the book of Aldini, that at the time\r\nhe finished it Oersted was still in communication with him; for he\r\nsays at the end (p. 376) he had not been able to add the information\r\nreceived from Oersted, Doctor of the University at Copenhagen, about\r\nthe galvanic labours of scientific men in that country.... It deserves\r\nto be remembered, that from Aldini’s book (“Essai théorique et\r\nexpérimental sur le galvanisme,” etc., Paris, 1804, qto. p. 191, or\r\nVol. I. of the 8vo ed., pp. 339–340) it was known that the chemist,\r\nGiuseppe Mojon (Joseph Mojon, in the French), at Genoa, had before\r\n1804 observed in unmagnetized needles exposed to the galvanic current\r\n‘a sort of polarity.’ Joseph Izarn repeats this also in his ‘Manuel du\r\nGalvanisme’ (Paris, An. xii., 1804, sec. iii. p. 120, or 1805, sec.\r\nix.), which book was one of those that by order were to be placed in\r\nthe library of every lycée of France.”\r\n\r\nRobert Sabine remarks (“The Electric Telegraph,” 8vo., 1867, p. 22;\r\n“History of the Electric Telegraph,” in Weale’s Rudimentary Treatises,\r\n1869, pp. 23, 24; “History and Progress of the Electric Telegraph,” 3rd\r\ned., 1872, p. 23):\r\n\r\n“The discovery of the power of a galvanic current to deflect a magnetic\r\nneedle, as well as to polarize an unmagnetized one, were known to,\r\nand described as early as 1804, by Prof. Izarn.... The paragraph\r\nwhich especially refers to this subject is headed ‘Appareil pour\r\nreconnaitre l’action du galvanisme, sur la polarité d’une aiguille\r\naimantée.’ After explaining the way to prepare the apparatus, which\r\nconsists simply in putting a freely suspended magnetic needle parallel\r\nand close to a straight metallic conductor through which a galvanic\r\ncurrent is circulating, he described the effects in the following\r\nwords: ‘According to the observations of Romagnosi, a physicist of\r\nTrent, a magnetized needle which is submitted to a galvanic current\r\nundergoes (_éprouve_) a declination; and according to those of J.\r\nMojon, a learned chemist of Genoa, unmagnetized needles acquire by this\r\nmeans a sort of magnetic polarity.’ To Romagnosi, physicist of Trent,\r\ntherefore, and not, as is generally believed, to Oersted, physicist at\r\nCopenhagen (who observed, in 1820, the phenomenon of the deflection of\r\na magnet needle by a voltaic current), is due the credit of having made\r\nthis important discovery.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Gilb. Govi, who gives in his afore-named work a good\r\nillustration of Romagnosi’s experiment, explains that it resembles in\r\nno way the experiment of Oersted, there being no magnetic action of\r\nthe column on the magnetic needle, which latter is in fact repelled\r\nby the mere electricity of the pile. Ronalds states that Romagnosi’s\r\nexperiment, much like that made by Schweigger (A. F. Gehlen’s\r\n_Journal für die Chimie und Physik_, 1808, pp. 206–208), was\r\na modification if not a repetition of the one which Thomas Milner\r\nperformed with static electricity (T. Milner’s “Experiments and\r\nObservations in Electricity,” London, 1783, p. 35), wherein a magnetic\r\nneedle forms the electrometer since improved upon by J. C. A. Peltier.\r\n\r\nTo the ordinary mind, a conclusive proof that Romagnosi had no part in\r\nthe discovery of electro-magnetism would seem to be, as Fahie rightly\r\nobserves, the fact that he himself never claimed any, although he lived\r\nuntil 1835, fifteen years after the announcement made by the Danish\r\nphilosopher. Fahie calls attention, for some experiments in the same\r\nline, to J. B. Van Mons’ _Journal de Chimie_, Bruxelles, January 1803,\r\np. 52, and to Nicholson’s _Journal of Nat. Phil._, Vol. VII. p. 304,\r\nas well as to the 1746 and 1763 _Phil. Trans._ for investigations\r\nmade by B. Robins and Ebenezer Kinnersley, and he likewise alludes to\r\nothers recorded in the _Amer. Polytechnic Review_ for 1831, and in the\r\n_Quarterly Journal of Science and the Arts_ for 1826, to all of which,\r\nhe says, as little real attention should be given as can properly be\r\nattached to the observations of Aldini and of Izarn previously referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES.--“Notizia di G.

The\r\nsuperior manner in which all his observations were carried on have led\r\nmany to consider him justly entitled to the credit of being the founder\r\nof the theory (Figuier, “Exposition et Histoire,” etc., Paris, 1857,\r\nVol. IV. chapitre viii. pp. 426–429).\r\n\r\nHe commenced his experiments in 1801, and first recorded them in a\r\nmemoir which was crowned the same year by the Batavi Scientific Society\r\nof Haarlem. His other papers on the same subject followed in rapid\r\nsuccession, mainly through L. W. Gilbert’s _Annalen der Physik_,\r\nunder such heads as: “Sketch of a New Theory of Galvanic Electricity,\r\nand Concerning the Decomposition of Water,” etc. (“Combination of\r\nInduction and Chemical Action,” Gilb., Vol. XII. p. 49, Seypfer, p.\r\n200), “How to Measure Electricity,” “Relative to the Electrometer,”\r\n“The Effects of the Condenser,” and “The Theory of Volta Concerning\r\nGalvanic Electricity,” all of which appeared in Vol. LXI. of the\r\n_Annalen_. These papers were alluded to in his letter to the\r\neditors of the _Annales de Chimie et de Physique_ (_An. Ch. et\r\nPhys._, Vol. XLII. p. 45), and were afterward greatly amplified in\r\nhis “Treatise on Natural Philosophy.”\r\n\r\nParrot started with the determination to demolish completely the\r\ntheories of Volta and to thoroughly instruct him anew (_instruire\r\nde toutes pièces le procès du physicien de Pavie_), and it must be\r\nadmitted that the many important facts enounced by Parrot were such as\r\nwould have ordinarily created a disturbing influence, but they became\r\nknown after Volta’s views had been thoroughly espoused by many German\r\nand French scientists and consequently attracted comparatively little\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nAt p. 466, Vol. II of Dr. Thomas Young’s “Course of Lectures,” London,\r\n1807, reference is made to a paper in Gilbert’s _Annalen der\r\nPhysik_ (X. p. 11, also XIII. p. 244), concerning Parrot’s theory\r\nof evaporation, with mention of the fact that the same paper contains\r\na proposal for inoculating the clouds with thunder and lightning, by\r\nprojecting bombs to a sufficient height.\r\n\r\nParrot also devised a scheme for telegraphing, which is described in\r\nthe _Mem. Acad. Petropol._, ser. vi. Vol. I for 1838, and is\r\nalluded to in the Report on Telegraphs for the United States, made\r\nat request of the Hon. Levi Woodbury, Secretary of the Treasury, by\r\nthe Committee on Science and the Arts of the Franklin Institute. The\r\nproposed telegraph, as worded in the Report, “consists of a single\r\narm or _indicator_, which should be about nine feet long and one\r\nfoot wide, with a cross-piece at one end, about three feet long and\r\none wide; the whole being movable about an axis at its centre.... The\r\nmovements may be communicated with ease and certainty, either by an\r\nendless chain passing over a wheel on the axis, and a wheel in the\r\nbuilding; or by a cog-wheel on the axis, and an endless screw on a\r\nvertical bar. For night signals, three lamps are used, one swinging\r\nbeyond the end of the arm, the other two beyond the ends of the\r\ncross-piece.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Gilbert’s _Annalen_, Vols.

Of the very great number of scientific papers\r\nwhich he communicated to learned Societies, that entitled “An Essay on\r\nthe Division of Salts through Galvanism” deserves especial mention, for\r\nin it, he lays down the electro-chemical theory, the honour of being\r\nthe original propounder of which is by many claimed for Sir Humphry\r\nDavy.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with Gottlieb Gahn, with W. Hisinger, of Elfstorps Bruk,\r\nand with the Swedish physician, Magnus Martin de Pontin, Berzelius made\r\nmany very extensive observations and published numerous treatises, the\r\nmost important of which are embraced in the papers named at foot (Sir\r\nHumphry Davy, “Bakerian Lectures,” London, 1840, more particularly at\r\npp. 13, 20, 109, 111, 122–123).\r\n\r\nAs has been before observed, the brilliant investigations of Berzelius\r\nand Hisinger, together with those of Nicholson and Carlisle, of Dr.\r\nWilliam Henry and of Sir Humphry Davy, actually created a new epoch\r\nin the history of chemistry. Prof. Wm. B. Rogers better expressed the\r\nfact in his address of Jan. 16, 1879, when saying that “through the\r\nlabours mainly of Berzelius and of Davy, the great generalization of\r\nelectro-positive and electro-negative substances was established, and\r\nwith it the fruitful theory of the electro-chemical exposition of\r\ncompound bodies.” Such of the experiments of Berzelius as were repeated\r\nby Sir Humphry Davy before the English Royal Institution, are embodied\r\nin Davy’s paper (partly alluded to above in “Bakerian Lectures”) which\r\nwas read before the Royal Society, June 30, 1808. According to J. F. W.\r\nHerschel, Berzelius and Hisinger ascertained it as a general law, that\r\nin all of the chemical decompositions which they effected, the acids\r\nand oxygen become transferred to, and accumulated around, the positive\r\npole, and hydrogen, alkaline earths and metals around the negative pole\r\nof a voltaic circuit; being transferred in an invisible, and, as it\r\nwere, a latent or torpid state, by the action of the electric current,\r\nthrough considerable spaces, and even through large quantities of water\r\nor other liquid, again to reappear with all their properties at their\r\nappropriate resting-places.\r\n\r\nBerzelius discovered selenium while examining certain substances found\r\nin the acid manufactured at Gripsholm, Sweden. He includes selenium\r\namong the metals; but as it is a nonconductor of electricity, also a\r\nmost imperfect conductor of heat, and as, in other respects, it bears\r\nmuch analogy to sulphur, it is generally placed among the non-metallic\r\ncombustibles (Brande, “Manual of Chemistry,” London, 1848, Vol. I. p.\r\n435; Berzelius, “Lehrbuch der Chemie,” “Traité,” etc., Paris, 1846,\r\nVol. II. p. 184; “Annales de Chimie et de Physique,” Vol. IX. p. 160;\r\n“Annals of Philosophy,” Vol. XIII. p. 401 and Vol. VIII, N.S. p. 104).\r\nThe important rôle which the high electrical resistance of selenium has\r\nin its early days been made to play by Mr. Willoughby Smith, Dr. Werner\r\nSiemens and others, is alluded to at pp. 791–794 of Vol. IV supplement\r\nto “Ure’s Dict. of Arts,” etc., London, 1878.\r\n\r\nFor full accounts of Berzelius’ numerous contributions to science,\r\nattention is called to the following:\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Royal Society Catal. of Sc.

Charcoal was permanently\r\nignited a length of nearly two inches and the galvanic action was\r\nstrong enough to light it after passing through a circuit of sixteen\r\npersons holding one another by the hand. Gold leaf displayed a bright\r\nwhite light, accompanied with smoke; silver leaf gave an intense green\r\nlight without sparks, but with still more smoke; while sheets of lead\r\nburned actively, with accompaniment of very red sparks mixed with the\r\nflame (Figuier, “Exposition,” etc., Paris, 1857, Vol. IV. p. 347).\r\n\r\nLater on, another battery was constructed by him for the London\r\nInstitution. This consisted of 400 pairs of plates five inches square,\r\nand of 40 pairs one foot square. With it, Davy ignited cotton, sulphur,\r\nresin, oil and ether, melted a platinum wire, burned several inches of\r\nan iron wire one three-hundredth of an inch in diameter, and boiled\r\neasily such liquids as oil and water, even decomposing and transforming\r\nthem into gases. It was during the year 1808 that Pepys finished\r\nthe enormous battery of 2000 double plates already alluded to under\r\nthe Cruikshanks (A.D. 1800) and the Davy (A.D. 1801) articles, and\r\nwhich is to be found described at p. 110 of the “Elements of Chemical\r\nPhilosophy.”\r\n\r\nOne year before that (1807) Pepys constructed a new form of eudiometer,\r\nof which a description was given before the Royal Society on the 4th of\r\nJune, as shown at p. 270 Vol. I of the “Abstracts of Papers,” etc., of\r\nthat Institution, as well as in the 1807 volume of the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_.\r\n\r\nOf the many ingenious experiments by which Pepys distinguished himself,\r\nscarcely none attracted more attention than those which are referred\r\nto in the last-named _Transactions_ for 1866, pp. 339–439. It is only\r\nsince 1815, when he employed the electric current to heat iron wire\r\nand diamond dust together, whereby he obtained steel, that the direct\r\ncarburization of iron by the diamond has been clearly established.\r\nPrior to this date, during 1798, Clouet had melted a little crucible of\r\niron weighing 57·8 grammes containing a diamond weighing 0·907 gramme,\r\nand produced a fused mass of steel. Guyton de Morveau reported upon\r\nClouet’s experiment in the _Annales de Chimie_ for 1799 (Vol. XXXI. p.\r\n328) and his investigations were repeated by many scientists, notably\r\nby Margueritte, as recently as 1865. The latter’s observations, which\r\nwere communicated to the _Annales de Chimie et de Physique_ (Tome\r\nVI), showed that, although carburization can be effected by simple\r\ncontact of carbon and iron in a gaseous atmosphere, it is nevertheless\r\ntrue that in the ordinary process of cementation the carbonic oxide\r\ngas plays an important part, which had until then been overlooked\r\n(Translation of Prof. W. C. Roberts-Austen, F.R.S. For Mr. Children’s\r\ninvestigations in the same line, see the _Phil. Trans._ for 1815, p.\r\n370, also A.D. 1809).\r\n\r\nSir Humphry Davy employed in his experiments on the decomposition and\r\ncomposition of the fixed alkalies two mercurial gasometers of Pepys’\r\ndesign, described in No. 14 of the _Phil. Trans._ for 1807, in\r\nconjunction with the same apparatus used by Messrs. Allen and Pepys for\r\nthe combustion of the diamond (“Bakerian Lectures,” London, 1840, pp.\r\n84 and 93).\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1822 Pepys constructed for electro-magnetic\r\nexperiments a very large spiral galvanic battery, which was put\r\ntogether for the London Institution on the plan of the one first\r\nbuilt by Dr. Robert Hare, Professor of Chemistry in the University\r\nof Pennsylvania. Pepys called it a _calorimotor_, by reason of its\r\nremarkable power of producing heat, and it is well illustrated in the\r\n8th Edit. “Encyclopædia Britannica” article on “Voltaic Electricity.”\r\nIt consisted only of two metallic sheets, copper and zinc, fifty to\r\nsixty feet long by two feet wide, coiled around a cylinder of wood and\r\nprevented from coming together by three ropes of horse-hair, the whole\r\nbeing suspended over a tub of acid so that, by a pulley or otherwise,\r\nit could be immersed or taken up. As stated in Vol. V of the _Trans. of\r\nthe Amer. Phil. Soc._, this battery required nearly fifty-five gallons\r\nof fluid, and the solution used contained about one-fortieth of strong\r\nnitrous acid.\r\n\r\nWhen, as Noad observes, it is stated that a piece of platinum wire may\r\nbe heated to redness by a pair of plates only four inches long and two\r\nbroad, the calorific power of such an arrangement as the above may be\r\nimagined to have been immense. The energy of the simple circle depends\r\non the size of the plates, the intensity of the chemical action on\r\nthe oxidizable metal, the rapidity of its oxidation, and the speedy\r\nremoval of the oxide. Pouillet is said to have constructed one of these\r\nbatteries with twelve couples for the Paris Faculté des Sciences, and\r\nfound it very powerful in producing large quantities of electricity\r\nwith low tension. The best liquid for this battery was water with\r\none-fortieth in volume of sulphuric acid and one-sixtieth of nitric\r\nacid. With the above-described battery of Mr. Pepys, Sir Humphry Davy\r\nperformed a remarkable experiment which is to be found described in\r\nthe _Phil. Trans._ for 1823. A similar apparatus was produced\r\nindependently, at about the same time, by Dr. Seebeck, of Berlin.\r\n\r\nAnother of Pepys’ inventions is the substitution, for the tinfoil\r\ncoatings within the glass of Bennet’s electroscope, of two plates,\r\nforming an acute angle, which, by means of a regulating screw, can be\r\nadjusted to any required distance from the gold leaves. The angular\r\npart is secured to the bottom; the open part perpendicularly upward.\r\nBy this mode of approximating the coatings to the gold leaves, the\r\nresistance being diminished, a weaker intensity of electricity suffices\r\nfor their disturbance.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Quarterly Journal of Science_, Vol. I for 1816;\r\n   _Phil.

His work on the\r\nsubject, entitled “Sur l’anatomie comparée,” etc., is alluded to\r\nin Vol. I. An. xi. No. 5 of the “Annales du Museum,” whence it is\r\ntranslated for the fifteenth volume of the _Phil. Mag._\r\n\r\nHis analyzation of the fluid in the cells of the _torpedo_ showed it\r\nto consist of albumen and gelatine; and he discovered some organs\r\nanalogous to those of the _torpedo_ in different species of the same\r\ngenus _raia_, which, strange to say, do not appear possessed of any\r\nelectrical power.\r\n\r\nThe electrical organs of the _silurus electricus_ he found to be much\r\nless complicated than those of other electrical fishes. They lie\r\nimmediately below the skin and stretch all around the body of the\r\nanimal. Their substance, he says, is a reticulated mass, the meshes\r\nof which are plainly visible, and these cells are filled, like those\r\nof other electrical fishes, with an albuminous gelatinous matter. The\r\nnerves distributed over the electrical organs proceed from the brain,\r\nand the two nerves of the eighth pair have a direction and nature\r\npeculiar to this species. (Consult C. Matteucci, “Traité des Phénomènes\r\n...” Paris, 1844, Chaps. VI and VII. pp. 301–327.)\r\n\r\nIn his great work on Egypt (Pl. XII, 2) Geoffroy gives the figure of\r\na _malapterus electricus_ (see Adanson, A.D. 1751) which is opened\r\nto show the viscera, but, by a singular inaccuracy, says Mr. James\r\nWilson, the fish is represented as scaly, whereas there are no scales\r\nwhatever upon this fish, and no fish known to possess electric powers\r\nhas either scales or spines. The _torpedo_, the _gymnotus_ and the\r\n_malapterus_ have all naked skins. The _tetraodon electricus_ (see Shaw\r\nat A.D. 1791) is also destitute of spines on the skin, although all its\r\ncongeners have skins as bristly as those of a hedgehog.\r\n\r\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire (Isidore), son of Etienne, was also a\r\ndistinguished naturalist. He became Assistant Professor of Zoölogy to\r\nhis father in 1829, likewise his assistant at the Faculté des Sciences\r\nin 1837, and, when Etienne became blind, during the year 1841, he\r\nsucceeded to the Professorship of Zoölogy at the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory.

He first made an opening into\r\nthe windpipe and, after introducing about three pints of oxygen into\r\nthe lungs, he applied conductors to the phrenic nerve as well as to\r\nother parts of the body, the lungs being at the same time occasionally\r\ninflated, but no action could be excited in the diaphragm. The\r\napplication of conductors to the inside of the nostrils and elsewhere,\r\nhowever, excited very considerable contractions in the right auricle\r\nmore than three hours after death, the ventricles being, as in Aldini’s\r\nexperiments, perfectly motionless.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Galvanic Experiments Made by Carpue on the Body of\r\n   Michael Carney,” etc., London, 1804 (_Phil.

Boissier,\r\n“Mémoire,” etc., Paris, 1801). After numerous investigations they\r\nadopted a compound consisting of common starch and either salts,\r\nvarnishes or gums, with which they made the necessary discs. These\r\ndiscs were dried and placed alternately between the copper and zinc\r\ncouples, but were afterward found to be too easily affected by moisture\r\nto prove very effective (D. Tommasi, “Traité des Piles Electriques,”\r\nParis, 1889, p. 529).\r\n\r\nIn the columns of the _Annales de Chimie_, named below, will be\r\nfound detailed the numerous experiments with the galvanic pile\r\ncarried on individually and collectively by Hachette, Desormes and\r\nother scientists; those of Hachette and Thénard upon the ignition of\r\nmetallic wires claiming especial notice.

Hachette and Desormes endeavoured to ascertain the direction\r\nwhich would be taken by a voltaic pile, whose poles were not joined,\r\nwhen freely suspended horizontally. Their pile, as Fahie gives it,\r\nwas composed of 1480 thin plates of copper tinned with zinc, of the\r\ndiameter of a five-franc piece, and was placed upon a boat floating\r\non the water of a large vat; but it assumed no determinate direction,\r\nalthough a magnetized steel bar, of a weight nearly equal to that of\r\nthe pile, and likewise placed upon the boat, would turn, after some\r\noscillations, into the magnetic meridian.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Annales de Chimie_, Vol. XXXVII. pp. 284–321;\r\n   XLIV. pp. 267–284; XLVII (Biot’s Observations), p. 13; XLIX.\r\n   pp. 45–54, and XLV for 1808.

The facts\r\nobtained by him were communicated to the Institute on the 29th\r\nMessidor, An. XI, and also appeared at the time in the Paris _Journal\r\ndes Débats_ (_Phil. Mag._, Vol. XVI. p. 299).\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of August of the year following (1804) Biot accompanied\r\nGay-Lussac in the latter’s first memorable balloon ascent. This\r\naeronautic voyage, sanctioned by the French Government mainly through\r\nthe efforts of Berthollet and Laplace, was the first of the kind\r\nundertaken solely for a scientific object.\r\n\r\nBesides numerous barometers and electrometers, Biot and Gay-Lussac\r\ncarried with them two compasses, a dipping needle and other\r\ninstruments. For the examination of the electricity of different\r\nstrata of the atmosphere, they had several metallic wires from 60 to\r\n300 feet in length, also a small electrophorus feebly charged, while\r\nfor galvanic experiments they added some discs of copper and zinc,\r\ntogether with a supply of frogs, insects and birds. An account of\r\nthe exceedingly important results obtained by those scientists at\r\ndifferent elevations, of which the highest reached exceeded four miles,\r\nwas read before the National Institute, Aug. 27, 1804. It was also\r\npublished in London during the latter year, and alluded to at p. 371,\r\nVol. XIX of the _Philosophical Magazine_. Mary Somerville remarks\r\n(“Connection of the Physical Sciences,” 1846, p. 334) that according\r\nto the observations of Biot and Gay-Lussac, the magnetic action is\r\nnot confined to the surface of the earth, but extends into space. The\r\nmoon has become highly magnetic by induction, in consequence of her\r\nproximity to the earth, and because her greatest diameter always points\r\ntoward it. Her influence on terrestrial magnetism is now ascertained;\r\nthe magnetism of the hemisphere that is turned toward the earth\r\nattracts the pole of our needles that is turned toward the south and\r\nincreases the magnetism of our hemisphere; and as the magnetic, like\r\nthe gravitating force, extends through space, the induction of the sun,\r\nmoon and planets must occasion perpetual variations in the intensity\r\nof terrestrial magnetism, by the continual changes in their relative\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nIn 1805 Biot published an investigation of the laws which should\r\ngovern the dip and intensity, in the hypothesis of a magnet situated\r\nat the centre of the earth, having its poles infinitely close to each\r\nother and directed to opposite points on the surface of the globe\r\nand, as justly adds Major Edward Sabine (Report Seventh Meeting Brit.\r\nAsso.), it is a well-known consequence of this hypothesis that the\r\nlines of equal dip and equal intensity on the earth’s surface should\r\neverywhere be parallel to each other. The phenomena of electricity\r\nhad been brought within the pale of mixed mathematics by C. A.\r\nCoulomb (A.D. 1785), whose considerations mainly attached\r\nto the distribution of electricity upon the surface of spheres, and\r\nhis investigations were at once diligently pursued by the French\r\nscientists, Biot, Laplace and Poisson. Laplace, who undertook to\r\ninvestigate the distribution of electricity upon the surface of\r\nellipsoids of revolution, showed that the thickness of the coating\r\nof the fluid at the pole was to its thickness at the equator as the\r\nequatorial is to the polar diameter, or, what is the same thing, that\r\nthe repulsive force of the fluid, or its tension at the pole, is to\r\nthat at the equator as the polar is to the equatorial axis. Biot\r\nextended this investigation to all spheroids differing little from\r\na sphere, whatever may be the irregularity of their figure, and his\r\nsolution of the problem will be found in No. 51 of the _Bulletin des\r\nSciences_. He also determined, analytically, that the losses of\r\nelectricity form a geometrical progression when the two surfaces of a\r\njar or plate of coated glass are discharged by successive contacts, and\r\nhe found that the same law regulated the discharge when a series of\r\njars or plates are placed in communication with each other (Whewell,\r\n“History of the Inductive Sciences,” Vol. II. pp. 208, 223; Noad’s\r\n“Manual,” p. 15; Eighth “Britannica,” Vol. VIII. p. 531. For Biot’s\r\nexperiments, touching upon electrical attraction and demonstrating\r\npractically the distribution of electricity upon the surface of a\r\nconductor, see the last-named volume of the “Britannica,” pp. 552, 556,\r\nand Noad, p. 56).\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with Frederick Cuvier, Mr. Biot investigated the\r\nconnection of chemical charge with the production of electricity. Like\r\nMr. W. H. Pepys, they examined the effect produced by the pile on\r\nthe atmosphere in which it is located. Mr. Pepys placed the pile in\r\nan atmosphere of oxygen, and found that in the course of a night 200\r\ncubic inches of the gas had been absorbed, but that in an atmosphere\r\nof azote the pile ceased to act. Biot and Cuvier likewise observed the\r\nquantity of oxygen absorbed, and inferred from their experiments that\r\n“although, strictly speaking, the evolution of electricity in the pile\r\nwas produced by oxidation, the share which this had in producing the\r\neffects of the instrument bore no comparison with that which was due\r\nto the contact of the metals, the extremity of the series being in\r\ncommunication with the ground.” Their investigation was attended by\r\nthe discovery that as long as any oxygen remained to be absorbed, the\r\nchemical and physiological effects of the apparatus still continued,\r\nbut with decreasing intensity; so that if the conducting wires attached\r\nto the two poles are made to return from under the receiver in tubes of\r\nglass they may be used to decompose water and communicate shocks to the\r\norgans. All these effects, however, cease when the surrounding oxygen\r\nis exhausted (_Annales de Chimie_, Vol. XXXIX. p. 242; _Soc.\r\nPhilomathique_, An. IX. p. 40; Sue, “Histoire du Galv.,” Vol. II. p.\r\n161).\r\n\r\nIn the second volume of Biot’s “Traité de Physique” will be found\r\nrecorded his many observations on the nature and origin of the electric\r\nlight, extracts from which are given by Sir David Brewster in the\r\nelectricity article of the “Britannica.” Biot remarks that the light\r\nwhich is observed during an electric explosion was for a long time\r\nconsidered by philosophers as a modification of the electric principle\r\nitself, which they supposed to be the quality of becoming luminous\r\nat a certain degree of accumulation (John Farrar, “Elem. of Elec.,\r\nMag. and El. Mag.,” 1826, p. 118). Brewster adds that this eminent\r\nFrench writer, however, considered the opinion as erroneous, and he\r\nhas devoted a whole chapter to prove that electricity has the same\r\norigin as the light disengaged from air by mechanical pressure, “and\r\nthat it is purely the effect of the compression produced on the air by\r\nthe explosion of electricity.” In order to establish this theory, Mr.\r\nBiot has stated, on the authority of several experiments, “that the\r\nintensity of electric light depends always on the ratio which exists\r\nbetween the quantity of electricity transmitted and the resistance\r\nof the medium”; and he has shown, by an experiment with Kinnersley’s\r\nthermometer, “that at each spark the air of the cylinder, driven by\r\nthe repulsive force, presses on the surface of mercury, which rises\r\nsuddenly in the small tube, and falls back again immediately after the\r\nexplosion.” He adds:\r\n\r\n“This indication proves the separation produced between the particles\r\nof the mass of air where the electricity passes; and from what\r\nwe know of its extreme velocity it is certain that the particles\r\nexposed immediately to its shock ought in the first moment to sustain\r\nindividually all the effect of the compression. They ought, then, from\r\nthis cause alone to disengage light, as when they are subjected to any\r\nother mechanical pressure. Thus one part at least of the electric light\r\nis necessarily due to this cause; and this being the case, there is no\r\nexperiment which can lead us to conjecture that it is not all due to\r\nthis cause.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Encycl.

B. Biot’s son, Edward Constant Biot (1803–1850), is the author of\r\nthe extended catalogue of shooting stars and other meteors observed in\r\nChina during twenty-four centuries, which was presented to the French\r\nAcademy during 1841, and a supplement to which was published at Paris\r\nin 1848 (_Acad. des Sciences_, _Savants Etrangers_, Tome X).\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1803–1805.=--Acting upon the discovery of Gautherot, the\r\nBavarian philosopher Johann Wilhelm Ritter (1776–1810) is the first to\r\nconstruct an electrical accumulator.\r\n\r\nRitter’s “ardency of research and originality of invention” had, as\r\nfar back as 1796, shown itself in the numerous very able scientific\r\npapers relating to Electricity, Galvanism and Magnetism which he had\r\ncommunicated mainly through L. W. Gilbert’s _Annalen der Physik_,\r\nJ. H. Voigt’s _Mag. für Naturkunde_ and A. F. Gehlen’s _Journal\r\nfür die Chemie_, all which obtained recognition in several foreign\r\npublications. These papers secured for him membership in the Munich\r\nAcademy during the year 1805.\r\n\r\nFrom Prof. H. W. Dove’s discourse before the Society for Scientific\r\nLectures, of Berlin, the following is extracted:\r\n\r\n“As the (then considered) essential portions of a galvanic circuit\r\nwere two metals and a fluid, innumerable combinations were possible,\r\nfrom which the most suitable had to be chosen. This gigantic task was\r\nundertaken by Ritter, an inhabitant of a village near Leignitz, who\r\nalmost sacrificed his senses to the investigation. He discovered the\r\npeculiar pile which bears his name, and opened that wonderful circle\r\nof actions and reactions which, through the subsequent discoveries of\r\nOersted, Faraday, Seebeck and Peltier, drew with ever-tightening band\r\nthe isolated forces of nature into an organic whole. But he died early,\r\nas Günther did before him, exhausted by restless labour, sorrow and\r\ndisordered living.”\r\n\r\nRitter’s _charging or secondary pile_ consists of but one metal,\r\nthe discs of which are separated by circular pieces of cloth, flannel\r\nor cardboard, moistened in a liquid which cannot chemically affect the\r\nmetal. When the extremities are put in communication with the poles of\r\nan ordinary voltaic pile it becomes electrified and can be substituted\r\nfor the latter; and it will retain the charge, so that for a time there\r\ncan be obtained from it sparks, shocks, as well as the decomposition of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the article at p. 268 of the April 1802 _Monthly\r\nMagazine_, making reference to _an artificial magnet_ discovered at\r\nVienna (Bakewell, “Elec. Science,” p. 40), no doubt alludes to the\r\nabove-named charging or secondary pile, in the construction of which\r\nRitter made many modifications. At first he arranged 32 copper and\r\ncard discs in three series, two of which series contained 16 copper\r\ndiscs while the intermediate series consisted of 32 card discs. He\r\nthen placed them so that the discs alternated, employing but 31 discs\r\nof copper, and he also used 64 as well as 128 copper discs alternating\r\nwith similar ones of cardboard. In each case he compared the chemical\r\naction through the decomposition of water as well as the physiological\r\neffect or shock and the physical property or electrical tension. The\r\nresults obtained are given in his many papers alluded to below.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the English scientists he discovered the property\r\npossessed by the voltaic pile of decomposing water as well as saline\r\ncompounds, and of collecting oxygen and acids at the positive pole\r\nwhile hydrogen and the bases collect at the negative pole. He conceived\r\nthat he had procured oxygen from water without hydrogen, by making\r\nsulphuric acid the medium of the communication at the negative surface,\r\nbut, as Davy says, in this case sulphur is deposited, while the\r\noxygen from the acid and the hydrogen from the water are respectively\r\nrepelled, and the new combination produced.\r\n\r\nA correspondent in Alex. Tilloch’s _Philosophical Magazine_ (Vol.\r\nXXIII for 1805–1806, pp. 51–54--Extracts from a letter of M. Christ.\r\nBernoulli abridged from Van Mons’ _Journal_, Vol. VI) thus alludes\r\nto some of Ritter’s experiments communicated in May 1805 to the Munich\r\nRoyal Society:\r\n\r\n“I have seen him galvanize a louis d’or. He places it between two\r\npieces of pasteboard thoroughly wetted, and keeps it six or eight\r\nminutes in the circuit of the pile. Thus it becomes charged, though\r\nnot immediately in contact with the conducting wires. If applied to\r\nthe recently bared crural nerves of a frog the usual contractions\r\nensue. I put a louis d’or thus galvanized into my pocket, and Ritter\r\ntold me, some minutes after, that I might discover it from the rest\r\nby trying them in succession upon the frog. I made the trial, and\r\nactually distinguished, among several others, one in which only the\r\nexciting quality was evident. The charge is retained in proportion to\r\nthe time that the coin has been in the circuit of the pile. Thus, of\r\nthree different coins, which Ritter charged in my presence, none lost\r\nits charge under five minutes. A metal thus retaining the galvanic\r\ncharge, though touched by the hand and other metals, shows that this\r\ncommunication of galvanic virtue has more affinity with magnetism than\r\nwith electricity, and assigns to the galvanic fluid an intermediate\r\nrank between the two. Ritter can, in the way I have just described,\r\ncharge at once any number of pieces. It is only necessary that the two\r\nextreme pieces of the number communicate with the pile through the\r\nintervention of wet pasteboards. It is with metallic discs charged\r\nin this manner and placed upon one another, with pieces of wet\r\npasteboard alternately interposed, that he constructs his charging\r\npile, which ought, in remembrance of its inventor, to be called the\r\n_Ritterian pile_. The construction of this pile shows that each\r\nmetal galvanized in this way acquires polarity, as the needle does when\r\ntouched with a magnet.”\r\n\r\nThe same correspondent alludes to experiments made with Ritter’s\r\nbattery of 100 pairs of metallic plates, the latter having their edges\r\nturned up so as “to prevent the liquid pressed out from flowing away”\r\n(_Phil. Mag._, Vol. XXIII. p. 51), but he says he was unable to\r\nsee either Ritter’s great battery of 2000 pieces, or the one of 50\r\npieces, each 36 inches square, the action of which is said to have\r\ncontinued very perceptibly for a fortnight. He writes as follows:\r\n\r\n“After showing me his experiments on the different contractibility of\r\nvarious muscles (“Beiträge zur nähern Kenntniss,” etc., Jena, 1802,\r\nB. II) Ritter made me observe that the piece of gold galvanized by\r\ncommunication with the pile exerts at once the action of two metals, or\r\nof one voltaic couple, and that the face which in the voltaic circuit\r\nwas next the negative pole became positive, and the face toward the\r\npositive pole negative. Having discovered a way to galvanize metals,\r\nas iron is rendered magnetic, and having found that the galvanized\r\nmetals always exhibit two poles as the magnetized needle does, Ritter\r\nsuspended a galvanized gold needle on a pivot, and perceived that it\r\nhad a certain dip and variation, or deflection, and that the angle of\r\ndeviation was always the same in all his experiments. It differed,\r\nhowever, from that of the magnetic needle, and it was the positive pole\r\nthat always dipped.”\r\n\r\nIt can truly be said that the nearest approach to a solution of the\r\nquestion as to the analogy between electric and magnetic forces, which\r\nhad remained unsettled since the time of Van Swinden (see A.D. 1784),\r\nwas given by Ritter, who announced “that a needle composed of silver\r\nand zinc arranged itself in the magnetic meridian and was slightly\r\nattracted and repelled by the poles of a magnet; that by placing a gold\r\ncoin in the voltaic circuit, he had succeeded in giving to it positive\r\nand negative electric poles; that the polarity so communicated was\r\nretained by the gold after it had been in contact with other metals,\r\nand appeared therefore to partake of the nature of magnetism; that a\r\ngold needle under similar circumstances acquired still more decided\r\nmagnetic properties; that a metallic wire, after being exposed to\r\nthe voltaic current, took a direction N.E. and S.W.” Dr. Roget gives\r\nthese same extracts in his article on “Electro-Magnetism,” and justly\r\nremarks that Ritter’s speculations were of too crude a nature to\r\nthrow any distinct light on the true connection between magnetism and\r\nelectricity, nor was much notice taken of Ritter’s announcements, owing\r\nto the vague manner in which they were made. No satisfactory results\r\nwere in fact obtained until Oersted (at A.D. 1820) made his famous\r\ndiscovery which forms the basis of the science of electro-magnetism.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--The “Encyclopædia Britannica” article relating to\r\n   the influence of magnetism on chemical action, for an account\r\n   of Ritter’s other experiments; also Faraday’s “Experimental\r\n   Researches,” No. 1033; Ritter’s “Physisch.

Similar experiments were made in the Weser;\r\nafterwards, with two wells, 21 feet deep and 200 feet apart; and,\r\nlastly, across a meadow 3000 to 4000 feet wide. Whenever the ground\r\nwas dry it was only necessary to wet it in order to feel a shock sent\r\nthrough an insulated wire from the distant battery. Erman, of Berlin,\r\nin 1803, and Sömmering, of Munich, in 1811, performed like experiments,\r\nthe one in the water of the Havel, near Potsdam, and the other along\r\nthe river Isar.\r\n\r\nFahie, from whom we take the above, alludes to Gilbert’s _Annalen der\r\nPhysik_, Vol. XIV. pp. 26 and 385, as well as to Hamel’s “Historical\r\nAccount,” p. 17, of Cooke’s reprint, and adds that Fechner, of Leipzig,\r\nafter referring to Basse’s and Erman’s experiments in his “Lehrbuch\r\ndes Galvanismus,” p. 268, goes on to explain the conductibility of the\r\nearth in accordance with Ohm’s law. As he immediately after alludes to\r\nthe proposals for electric telegraphs, he has sometimes been credited\r\nwith the knowledge of the fact that the earth could be used to complete\r\nthe circuit in such cases. This, however, is not so, as we learn from\r\na letter which Fechner addressed to Prof. Zetzsche, on the 19th of\r\nFebruary 1872.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Zetzsche’s “Geschichte der Elektrischen\r\n   Telegraphie,” p. 19.

XI. These precepts, De la Rive says (“Treatise\r\non Elect.,” translated by C. V. Walker, London, 1858, Vol. III. pp.\r\n587, 588), are followed to this day and are extremely simple, requiring\r\nonly the use of metallic brushes held by an insulated handle and put\r\ninto communication with the conductor of the machine; and directing\r\nthe application of electricity in its mildest form as well as its\r\ngradual increase to as much as the invalid is able to support, besides\r\nallowing of the concurrent employment of other means acting in the same\r\ndirection, such as frictions, blisters, etc.\r\n\r\nAntoine Thillaye-Platel’s uncle, Jean Baptiste Jacques Thillaye\r\n(1752–1822), French physician and Professor of Anatomy at Rouen and in\r\nParis, published “Eléments de l’Elect. et du Galv.,” Paris, 1816–1817,\r\nten years after the death of his nephew (Poggendorff, Vol. II. p. 1094;\r\nLarousse, “Dict.

By this simple\r\ndevice the power of the apparatus is quadrupled, it being made capable\r\nof indicating in all 252 changes.\r\n\r\nThe night signals are given by a coloured lamp mounted in the centre of\r\nthe seventh or sliding shutter and by six white lights fastened to the\r\noutside of the frame, to produce, through their display or concealment\r\nby slides, the same signals as, under ordinary circumstances, are given\r\nby the opening and closing of the shutters.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1805.=--Grotthus--Grothuss--(Theodor--more properly Christian\r\nJohann Dietrich, Baron von) makes known his theory of electro-chemical\r\ndecompositions, through the “Mémoire,” etc., published in 12mo at Rome,\r\nand of which an English translation appeared in London during 1806.\r\n\r\nAs Lardner and Fahie have it, Grotthus’ theory was the most plausible\r\nof the many proposed at this early period of experimental inquiry\r\nto explain chemical decomposition by the voltaic apparatus. The\r\nabove-named “Mémoire ...” which appeared in the _Phil. Mag._ for 1806,\r\nVol. XXV. pp. 330–334, is analyzed by both of these writers (Lardner,\r\n“Electricity, Mag. and Meteor.,” Vol. I. pp. 135–137, or “Popular\r\nLectures,” 1851, Vol. I. pp. 348, 349; Fahie, “Hist. of Elec. Teleg.,”\r\npp. 210, 211), but it may be briefly stated in the words of Sir David\r\nBrewster as follows:\r\n\r\n“Grotthus (_Annales de Chimie_ for 1806, Vol. LVIII. p. 61) regards the\r\npile as an electric magnet with _attracting_ and _repelling_ poles, the\r\none attracting hydrogen and repelling oxygen, and the other attracting\r\noxygen and repelling hydrogen. The force exerted upon each molecule of\r\nthe body is supposed to be inversely as its distance from the poles,\r\nand a succession of decompositions and recompositions is supposed to\r\nexist among the intervening molecules.”\r\n\r\nIn this connection it will be well to add here, by way of contrast,\r\nand again according to Sir David Brewster, the views held by other\r\nexperimentalists of the same period. Sir Humphry Davy adopts the idea\r\nof attractions at the poles, diminishing to the middle or neutral\r\npoints, and he thinks a succession of decompositions and recompositions\r\nprobable. Messrs. Riffault and Chompré regard the negative current as\r\ncollecting and carrying the acids on to the positive pole, and the\r\npositive current as doing the same, with the bases toward the negative\r\npole. Biot attributes the effects to the opposite electrical states of\r\nthe decomposing substances in the vicinity of the two poles. M. De la\r\nRive considers the portions decomposed to be those contiguous to both\r\npoles, the current from the positive pole combining with the hydrogen\r\nor the bases which are there present, and leaving the oxygen or acids\r\nat liberty, but carrying the substances in union with it across to the\r\nnegative pole, where it is separated from them, entering the conducting\r\nmetal, and leaving on its surface the hydrogen or its bases. Faraday\r\nregards the poles as exercising no specific action, but merely as\r\nsurfaces or doors by which the electricity enters into or passes out of\r\nthe substance undergoing decomposition. He supposes that “the effects\r\nare due to a modification of the electric current and the chemical\r\naffinity of the particles through or by which that current is passing,\r\ngiving them the power of acting more forcibly in one direction than in\r\nanother, and consequently making them travel by a series of successive\r\ndecompositions and recompositions in opposite directions, and finally\r\ncausing their repulsion or exclusion at the boundaries of the body\r\nunder decomposition in the direction of the current, and that, in\r\nlarger or smaller quantities, according as the current is more or less\r\npowerful.”\r\n\r\nIn 1810 Grotthus published his “Uber d. elektricität ... wassers\r\nentwickelt,” one of his curious observations being the fact that when\r\nwater is rapidly frozen in a Leyden jar, the outside coating, not being\r\ninsulated, receives a weak electrical discharge, the inside being\r\npositive and the outside negative, and when the ice is rapidly thawed,\r\nthe inside is negative and the outside positive.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Faraday’s “Experimental Researches,” articles 481,\r\n   485, 489, 492, 507, etc.; also _Phil.

Clausius\r\nmaintained that the exchanges were going on continuously, although no\r\ncurrent was flowing; while the assumption of Arrhénius was that in\r\nevery electrolyte, a certain number of molecules break up into ions and\r\nthat all electrolytes contain some of these free ions. This is the much\r\ncontroverted dissociation theory (Dr. Henry S. Carhart’s Presidential\r\nAddress).\r\n\r\nThe “Encycl. Amer.,” New York, 1903, Vol. II says that the\r\nestablishment of the theory of electrolytic dissociation, which is due\r\nto the noted Swedish chemist, Svante Arrhénius, supplies a reasonable\r\nexplanation of many chemical phenomena otherwise insoluble, and\r\ncorrelates various facts between which no connection was previously\r\ndiscovered. Two important publications by Arrhénius are “Sur la\r\nconductibilité galvanique des electrolytes” (1884), and a treatise in\r\nGerman on electro-chemistry (1902).

P. Kelland,\r\nM.A., F.R.S., during the year 1845.\r\n\r\nThe above-named work comprises the sixty lectures which Dr. Young\r\ndelivered during his connection with the Royal Institution and includes\r\nalso his optical and other memoirs, as well as a very extended\r\nclassified catalogue of publications in every leading department of\r\nscience. His biographer in the “English Encyclopædia” remarks that\r\nYoung’s lectures embody a complete system of natural and mechanical\r\nphilosophy, drawn from original sources, and are distinguished\r\nnot only by extent of learning and accuracy of statement, but by\r\nthe beauty and originality of the theoretical principles. One of\r\nthese is the principle of interferences in the undulatory theory of\r\nlight. “This discovery alone,” says Sir John Herschel, “would have\r\nsufficed to have placed its author in the highest rank of scientific\r\nimmortality, were even his other almost innumerable claims to such a\r\ndistinction disregarded.” The first reception, however, of Dr. Young’s\r\ninvestigations of light was very unfavourable. The novel theory of\r\nundulation especially was attacked in the _Edinburgh Review_, and\r\nDr. Young wrote a pamphlet in reply, of which it is said but one copy\r\nwas sold, but it is now generally received in place of the molecular or\r\nemanatory theory.\r\n\r\nHis review and treatment of the field of electrical and magnetic\r\nphenomena, as may be imagined from the foregoing, is very extensive,\r\nand as no justice could be done it by making therefrom such extracts as\r\nwould suitably come within the scope of the present “Bibliographical\r\nHistory,” only an extract from the lecture treating of “Aqueous and\r\nIgneous Meteors” will here be given.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the aurora borealis, he says “that it is doubtful if its\r\nlight may not be of an electrical nature. The phenomenon is certainly\r\nconnected with the general cause of magnetism. The primitive beams of\r\nlight are supposed to be at an elevation of at least 50 or 100 miles\r\nabove the earth, and everywhere in a direction parallel to that of the\r\ndipping needle; but perhaps, although the substance is magnetical, the\r\nillumination, which renders it visible, may still be derived from the\r\npassage of electricity, at too great a distance to be discovered by any\r\nother test.... It is certainly in some measure a magnetical phenomenon;\r\nand if iron were the only substance capable of exhibiting magnetic\r\neffects, it would follow that some ferruginous particles must exist in\r\nthe upper regions of the atmosphere. The light usually attending this\r\nmagnetical meteor may possibly be derived from electricity, which may\r\nbe the immediate cause of a change in the distribution of the magnetic\r\nfluid contained in the ferruginous vapours that are imagined to float\r\nin the air.”\r\n\r\nThe assumption of ferruginous particles or vapours, remarks Prof.\r\nRobert Jameson, of the Edinburgh University, seems, however, purely\r\ngratuitous and imaginary; and as iron is not the only substance or\r\nmatter capable of exhibiting magnetic effects, light itself being\r\nsusceptible of polarization, the above hypothesis is, therefore,\r\nuntenable even on the ground upon which it has been rested by its\r\nauthor. But it is, nevertheless, certain that the cause of this\r\nluminous meteor is intimately connected with magnetism and electricity;\r\nor, rather, as the magnetic is variously modified and effected by the\r\nelectric power, with the phenomena of electro-magnetism.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Young’s Catalogue for “Aurora Borealis” and\r\n   “Terrestrial Magnetism” (“Lectures,” London, 1807, Vol. II. pp.\r\n   440–443, 488–490), “Journal Roy.

After he had seen the French semaphore during\r\n1809 he improved his telegraph, employing but one post, upon which were\r\nthree pairs of pivoted arms representing hundreds, tens and units.\r\n\r\nIn 1823 Pasley (then a Lieutenant-Colonel, Royal Engineers) issued\r\na pamphlet entitled “Description of the Universal Telegraph for Day\r\nand Night Signals,” wherein he announces the abandonment of the\r\npolygrammatic principle. For day service he employs an upright post\r\nwith two movable arms attached to the top on a pivot. Each arm is\r\ncapable of assuming seven different positions, besides the quiescent\r\nposition called the _stop_, in which the arms are turned down and\r\nconcealed by the post. To prevent signals being seen in reverse,\r\nanother arm, called an _indicator_, is added to one side of the post.\r\nFor night signals he places a central lamp at the top of the post, as\r\nwell as a lamp at the end of each arm, and suspends a fourth lamp, as\r\nan indicator, upon a light crane projecting horizontally beyond the\r\nrange of both movable arms. Motion to the arms was communicated by\r\nmeans of an endless chain passing over two pulleys. Up to this time\r\nthe semaphores employed by the Admiralty had been constructed without\r\nprovision being made for the display of night signals.\r\n\r\nPasley was the first to apply the heating power of the galvanic battery\r\nto a useful practical purpose. While engaged on the River Thames he was\r\nwritten to by Mr. Palmer (Alfred Smee, “Electro-Metallurgy,” p. 297),\r\nwho advised him to employ the galvanic battery instead of the long fuse\r\nthen in common use, and as soon as he was made acquainted with the\r\nmethod of operating he at once adopted it and applied it effectively,\r\nduring the year 1839, to the removal of the sunken hull of the “Royal\r\nGeorge,” at Spithead.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Sturgeon’s “Scientific Researches,” Bury, 1850, p.\r\n   174; Knight’s “Mech.

A patented\r\n   telegraph by James Boaz is alluded to in Vol. XII. pp. 84–87 of\r\n   the _Phil. Magazine_.\r\n\r\nFollowing close upon Pasley’s original telegraphic contrivance were\r\nseveral other methods of conveying intelligence at a distance,\r\nintroduced at this period, worthy of mention here.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier A. N. Edelcrantz, Swedish savant, sent to the London\r\nSociety of Arts a model of his apparatus, which is to be found minutely\r\ndescribed in Vol. XXVI. pp. 20, 184–189, of the _Transactions_ of\r\nthat institution. A description of his earlier contrivances for the\r\nsame purpose had already been published at Stockholm in the year\r\n1796, and after being translated into French had been noticed in\r\nWilliam Nicholson’s _Journal of Natural Philosophy_ for 1803. The\r\none he finally adopted in 1808 consisted of ten boards placed in\r\nthree vertical ranks, the central one having four boards and the side\r\nranks three boards each. By this arrangement 1024 signals could be\r\nclearly shown, and it was possible, by observing the _order_ in which\r\nthe boards were exhibited, to make as many as 4,037,912 changes. He\r\nsubsequently advised attaching lamps to the boards for night service.\r\nHis system of working the boards, though very complicated, could be\r\ncontrolled by only one person, while the English method required\r\nseveral men to hold the shutters during heavy weather. As it was, his\r\nmethod is said to have been in constant use for fully twelve years\r\nprior to 1808 on both sides of the Baltic, and to have likewise served\r\nto transmit signals between Sweden and England.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Ward, who had observed the difficulty with which the\r\ntelegraph was worked at Blandford, in Dorsetshire, contrived the\r\napparatus described in Vol. XXVI. pp. 20, 207–209 of the London\r\n_Journal of the Society of Arts_. The grooved wheels which are\r\nfixed upon the axis of the shutters to receive the ropes by which they\r\nare turned have the grooved portion of the rim formed in two segments,\r\nwhich are so attached to the periphery of the wheels by steel springs\r\nthat they fly off and remain a little distance off when there is\r\nno strain upon the ropes, although so soon as a rope is pulled its\r\npressure forces the segments into close contact with the solid rim of\r\nthe wheel. In the segments are two notches, which, when the shutters\r\nare in either of their required positions, engage with a fixed catch\r\nso soon as the strain on the ropes is relaxed, and thus hold the\r\nshutters steady without any aid from the attendant. The pulling of a\r\nrope by drawing the segments close to the wheel releases the catch,\r\nand consequently enables the attendant to return any shutter to its\r\noriginal position.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel John Macdonald, F.R.S., who was already favourably\r\nknown by two Reports on the Diurnal Variation of the Magnetic\r\nNeedle observed at Fort Marlborough, Sumatra, and at St. Helena\r\n(_Philosophical Transactions_ for 1796, p. 340, and for 1798, p. 397,\r\nalso “Eighth Encycl. Brit.,” Vol. XIV. p. 54), publishes (1808–1817)\r\ntwo treatises upon his “Terrestrial Telegraph,” accompanied by an\r\nextensive “Telegraphic Dictionary.” His contrivance consists of\r\nthirteen boards or shutters arranged, like those of Edelcrantz, into\r\nthree vertical ranks representing hundreds, tens and units. Twelve of\r\nthe boards are capable of producing 4095 distinct combinations, and\r\nthe thirteenth or auxiliary board, which is mounted over the centre\r\nof the apparatus, doubles that number. A flag or vane is added to the\r\nhundred side to distinguish it in whatever direction it may be viewed,\r\nand a ball sliding upon the staff which supports it affords the means\r\nof again doubling the number, so that, on the whole, 16,380 distinct\r\nsignals can be obtained. He subsequently adopted a modification of the\r\ncontrivance introduced by Pasley in 1809, and also described a sort\r\nof a “Symbolic Telegraph,” in which symbols like those of Dr. Hooke,\r\nbut representing numerals instead of alphabetical characters, were\r\ndropped into open spaces denoting hundreds, tens and units. He further\r\nsuggested a useful flag telegraph for the navy and devised several\r\nschemes for night telegraphs both for land and sea, one of which latter\r\nconsists of three sets of four lights each, with an additional or\r\n_director_ light to each set, affording the same extensive powers as\r\nhis large board or shutter telegraph (_Phil. Mag._, Vols. LVII. pp.\r\n88–93, and LVIII. pp. 99–103).\r\n\r\nMajor Charles Le Hardy communicates in 1808 to the London Society of\r\nArts, Vol. XXVI. pp. 20, 180–183, a novel contrivance consisting of a\r\nlarge framework with nine radiating bars, representing the numerals\r\nfrom 1 to 9, and four sets of other bars intersecting them so as to\r\nform four concentric polygons, which latter express units, tens,\r\nhundreds and thousands; thousands being shown by the innermost polygon.\r\nAttached to the centre of the apparatus are four slender arms, carrying\r\nfour square boards, the lengths of these arms being such that the board\r\nof one may, during the revolution of the arm, traverse the polygon\r\nwhich represents thousands, that of another the polygon representing\r\nhundreds, etc. By the addition of two other boards at the upper\r\ncorners, one of which denotes 10,000 and the other 20,000, or, when\r\ndisplayed together, 30,000, the total range of the telegraph is from 1\r\nto 39,999 (_Philosophical Magazine_, Vol. XXXIII. p. 343).\r\n\r\nIn the twenty-seventh volume of the _Transactions_ of the London\r\nSociety of Arts will be found the telegraphic devices of Knight\r\nSpencer and of Lieutenant James Spratt (pp. 20, 163–169), while the\r\nthirty-third volume contains (at pp. 23, 118–121) a description of\r\nthe contrivance of Alexander Law, intended for service on both sea\r\nand land. These, it may be said, are the only additional telegraphic\r\nmethods worthy of note introduced up to the time when the English\r\nAdmiralty adopted the system proposed by Sir Home Popham in 1816. The\r\n“anthropo-telegraph” of Knight Spencer, though laid before the Society\r\nof Arts in 1808, had been used as early as 1805. It consisted merely of\r\ntwo circular discs of wicker work, painted white with a black circle\r\nin the centre, to be held in different positions with respect to each\r\nother. The device of Lieutenant Spratt was more simple still, for it\r\nconsisted only in holding a kerchief in various positions; yet, simple\r\nas it was, it served as a means of communication between vessels before\r\nthe battle of Trafalgar, and it was also successfully used to converse\r\nbetween Spithead and the ramparts at Portsmouth, etc.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--For Mr. Knight Spencer’s other papers, see the\r\n   _Philosophical Magazine_, Vols.

This consisted of twenty pairs of copper and zinc\r\nplates, each six feet long and two feet eight inches wide, the\r\nunited capacities of the cells being 945 gallons. With this battery\r\nhe confirmed Davy’s observation that “intensity increases with the\r\nnumber (of plates) and the quantity of the electricity with the extent\r\nof surface.” It is reported that, when in full action, the battery\r\nrendered a platinum wire five feet six inches long and ¹¹⁄₁₀₀ of\r\nan inch in diameter red-hot throughout so as to be visible in full\r\ndaylight; that eight feet six inches of platinum wire ⁴⁴⁄₁₀₀ of an inch\r\nin diameter were easily heated red; that a bar of platinum one-sixth of\r\nan inch square and two and a quarter inches long was heated red-hot and\r\nfused at the end; and that a round bar of the same metal, ²⁷⁶⁄₁₀₀₀ of\r\nan inch in diameter and two and a half inches long, was heated bright\r\nred throughout.\r\n\r\nThe result of many other investigations which he also made in 1813 and\r\nduring 1815 showed that metallic wires (eight inches long and ¹⁄₃₀ of\r\nan inch diameter) became red-hot in the following order: platinum,\r\niron, copper, gold, zinc, silver; and he deduced that their conducting\r\npower was in the inverse order, silver conducting best and platinum\r\nleast. Tin and lead fused immediately at the point of contact, and the\r\noxides of tungsten, uranium, cerium, titanium, iridium and molybdenum\r\nwere also fused.

Tulk and published in London,\r\nduring 1847, by the Royal Society, under the title of “Elements of\r\nPhysico-Philosophy.”\r\n\r\nThis work, says his biographer in the “English Cyclopædia” (Vol. IV.\r\np. 557), takes the widest possible view of natural science: it is\r\ninteresting as a document in the history of a great mental movement and\r\ncontains the germs of those principles which are now regarded as the\r\nsecure generalization of well-observed facts.\r\n\r\nFrom the epitome of the work given in the “Encyclopædia Britannica,”\r\nthe following is extracted: “Polarity is the first force which appears\r\nin the world.... Galvanism is the principle of life ... the vital force\r\n... the galvanic process is one with the vital process.... There is no\r\nother vital force than the galvanic polarity.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Richard Owen, Lorenz Oken contends that organism\r\nis galvanism residing in a thoroughly homogeneous mass. A galvanic\r\npile, pounded into atoms, must become alive. In this manner, nature\r\nbrings forth organic bodies. The basis of electricity is the air; of\r\nmagnetism, metal; of chemism (the name he gives to the influence that\r\nproduces chemical combination), salts. The basis of galvanism, in\r\nlike manner, is the organic mass. Accordingly, whatever is organic is\r\ngalvanic; whatever is alive is galvanic. Life, organism, galvanism,\r\nare one. Life is the vital process; the vital process is an organic\r\nor galvanic process. Galvanism is the basis of all the processes of\r\nthe organic world.... God did not make man out of nothing, but took\r\nan elemental body then existing, an earth-clod or carbon, moulded it\r\ninto form, thus making use of water, and breathed into it life, viz.\r\nair, whereby galvanism or the vital process arose.... Organization\r\nis produced by the co-operating process of light and heat. The ether\r\nimparts the substance, the heat the form, the light the life....\r\nThe life of an inorganic body is a threefold action of the three\r\nterrestrial elements, in which three processes galvanism consists. The\r\nnutrient process is magnetic, present and entire in every part of the\r\nbody, and wheresoever it is withdrawn there is death.... These three\r\nprocesses constitute the galvanic process. Thus the galvanic circle\r\nis complete, and motion is the manipulation of galvanism. The process\r\nof motion is synonymous with the galvanic process--this is the vital\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--The extended biography of Lorenz Oken, embracing\r\n   a list of his chief works and original essays at pp. 498–503,\r\n   Vol. XVI of the Eighth “Encycl.

He had,\r\nindeed, on other occasions shown somewhat too much scepticism in the\r\nrejection of new facts; and he had never been convinced even of Mr.\r\nCavendish’s all-important discovery of the composition of water.\r\n\r\nThe paper was afterwards published in _Nicholson’s Journal_ (Vol.\r\nXXVI), and the dry column described in it was constructed by various\r\nexperimental philosophers. It exhibited a continual vibrating motion,\r\nmade sensible by the sound of a little bell, which was struck by the\r\npendulum at each alternation; and during many months the vibration was\r\nmore or less rapid, according to circumstances affecting the column.\r\n\r\nThis dry column consists of discs of Dutch gilt paper, alternated\r\nwith similar discs of laminated zinc, so arranged that the order of\r\nsuccession will be maintained throughout. When sufficiently dry these\r\nare piled upon each other, the gilt side of the paper being in contact\r\nwith the zinc, and all are pressed together in a glass tube by a brass\r\ncap and screw connected at each end with a metallic wire. The column\r\npresented by De Luc to the Royal Society consisted of 300 discs of zinc\r\nand of 300 discs of gilt paper. It is said that, with a larger column,\r\nthe vibration of a brass ball suspended between two bells was so\r\ncontinued as to maintain a perpetual ringing for over two years; that\r\nwith an apparatus comprising 20,000 groups of silver, zinc and double\r\ndiscs of writing paper, sparks have been obtained, while a Leyden jar\r\nwas charged in ten minutes with sufficient electricity to produce\r\nshocks and to fuse an inch of platinum wire of an inch in diameter; and\r\nthat a similar pile, in the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford, rang ten\r\nsmall bells continuously for over forty years.\r\n\r\nIn Vols. XXXV, XXXVI and XXXVII of the “Phil. Mag.,” and in Vols.\r\nXXVII and XXVIII of “Nicholson’s Journal,” André de Luc shows how the\r\ndry column can be used for determining the insulating qualities and\r\nconducting power of bodies, it having been also employed as are aerial\r\nelectroscopes to indicate the electrical changes taking place in the\r\natmosphere.

XXXVII and XXXVIII; _Journal Society of Arts_, Vol. VII.\r\np. 235). The complete apparatus consists of thirty-five gold rods\r\nplaced into glass tubes starting from a reservoir of acidulated water\r\nand connecting with thirty-five silk-covered wires, which are run\r\ninto thirty-five apertures of copper (corresponding with twenty-five\r\nletters and ten figures) upon a wooden stand into each opening of\r\nwhich the wires of the voltaic pile can be inserted. When the latter\r\nare connected, the bubbles rising through the decomposition of the\r\nwater are made to enter the lettered glass receivers through which\r\nthe messages can be deciphered. On August 8, 1809, he was able to\r\ntransmit intelligence a distance of 1000 feet, and twenty days later\r\nhe presented his apparatus to the Bavarian Academy of Sciences (Fahie,\r\n“Hist. of Electric Telegraphy,” p. 228).\r\n\r\nSömmering’s telegraph was carried by Dominique Jean Larrey, chief\r\nsurgeon of the French armies, to Paris, where it was delivered by him\r\nto the French Academy of Sciences, Dec. 5, 1809, and Dr. Hamel states\r\nthat Biot, Carnot, Charles and Monge were appointed by that body to\r\nreport upon the new invention (_Journal of the Franklin Institute_\r\nfor 1859, Vol. XXXVIII. p. 398). In 1810 and 1811, Sömmering reduced\r\nthe number of wires in his apparatus to twenty-seven. These brass or\r\ncopper wires were first insulated with a covering of gum lac and then\r\nwith silk thread, after which they were united into a thread-covered\r\ncable 1000 feet in length. The cable was in turn covered with heated\r\ngum lac or with a ribbon plunged in a solution of the same substance.\r\nThe Russian Count Jeroslas Potocki took the new instrument to Vienna\r\nand submitted it, July 1, 1811, to the Emperor Francis I, while another\r\nmodel of the apparatus was sent to William Sömmering, then at Geneva,\r\nwhere it was shown to De la Rive, Auguste Pictet and other scientists.\r\nDuring March 1812 this instrument carried intelligence 10,000 feet, or\r\nten times the distance previously reached.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Dr. Hamel, Cooke’s reprint, pp. 7, 8.

Reference\r\nis made to the first germ of pneumatic telegraphy sown by the English\r\nengineer, George Medhurst, during the year 1810.\r\n\r\nThe London _Telegraphic Journal_, which gives an extract from\r\nthe specification of Medhurst’s patent “for a new method of conveying\r\nletters and goods with great certainty and rapidity by air,” states\r\nthat the process took practical form only in 1854, when Latimer\r\nClark laid down a one-and-a-half-inch lead pipe between the Electric\r\nTelegraph Company’s central station, Lothbury, and the London Stock\r\nExchange. The system was extended in 1858 to Mincing Lane, and, two\r\nyears later, Varley introduced the use of compressed air, so that\r\nmessages were drawn one way by a vacuum, and propelled in the opposite\r\ndirection by a prenum, instead of employing a vacuum both ways, as\r\nLatimer Clark had previously done. During the year 1865 the system,\r\nthen considerably modified, was introduced into Paris, and it was\r\nalso made use of, at about the same time, by the Messrs. Siemens, who\r\nemployed it between the Bourse and the telegraph station in the city\r\nof Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1810.=--Jacopi (Joseph), Italian physician, anatomist and\r\nphysiologist (1774–1813), pupil of the famous Scarpa, makes known\r\nthrough his “Elementi di Fisiologia e Notomia comparata” (“Eléments de\r\nPhysiologie et d’Anatomie comparée”), the results of his very extended\r\ninvestigations of the electrical organs of the _torpedo_.\r\n\r\nTo him is due the first clear description of the electrical lobes\r\nsituated in the _torpedo’s_ brain and of its relation to the eighth\r\npair of nerves distributed throughout the hexagonal columns, which\r\nlatter received also from him a very extended notice in the above-named\r\nwork. The fifth ramification of nerves was first observed by Carus,\r\nand the most valuable investigation relative to the fourth and last\r\nimportant group of nerves directly connected with the electrical organs\r\nwas made by the celebrated Italian professor, Carlo Matteucci.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Larousse, “Dict.

One of his\r\nbiographers remarks that Poisson’s object was “to leave no branch\r\nof physics unexplored by aid of the new and powerful methods of\r\ninvestigation which a school, yet more modern than that of Lagrange and\r\nLaplace, had added to the pure mathematics.”\r\n\r\nAs shown, notably by Sir David Brewster in his able article on\r\n“Electricity” in the eighth “Encycl. Brit.” (Vol. VIII. p. 531), and by\r\nNoad, in his “Manual” (London, 1859, pp. 15, 16):\r\n\r\n“Poisson adopted as the basis of his investigations the theory of two\r\nfluids, proposed by Symmer and Dufay, with such modifications and\r\nadditions as were suggested by the researches of Coulomb. He deduced\r\ntheorems for determining the distribution of the electric fluid on the\r\nsurfaces of two conducting spheres, when they are placed in contact\r\nor at any given distance, the truth of which had been established\r\nexperimentally by Coulomb before the theorems themselves had been\r\ninvestigated. On bodies of elongated forms, or those which have edges,\r\ncorners or points, it is shown as a consequence of the theory of two\r\nfluids that the electric fluid accumulates in greater depths about the\r\nedges, corners or points than in other places. Its expansive force,\r\nbeing therefore greater at such parts than elsewhere, exceeds the\r\natmospheric pressure and escapes, while at other points of the surface\r\nit is retained.”\r\n\r\nIn the latter connection Mary Somerville remarks:\r\n\r\n“There can hardly be a doubt but that all the phenomena of magnetism,\r\nlike those of electricity, may be explained on the hypothesis of one\r\nethereal fluid, which is condensed or redundant in the positive pole,\r\nand deficient in the negative; a theory that accords best with the\r\nsimplicity and general nature of the laws of creation; nevertheless,\r\nPoisson has adopted the hypothesis of two extremely rare fluids,\r\npervading all the particles of iron, and incapable of leaving them.\r\nWhether the particles of these fluids are coincident with the molecules\r\nof the iron, or that they only fill the interstices between them, is\r\nunknown and immaterial. But it is certain that the sum of all the\r\nmagnetic molecules, added to the sum of all the spaces between them,\r\nwhether occupied by matter or not, must be equal to the whole volume\r\nof the magnetic body.... M. Poisson has proved that the result of the\r\naction of all the magnetic elements of a magnetized body is a force\r\nequivalent to the action of a very thin stratum covering the whole\r\nsurface of a body, and consisting of the two fluids--the austral and\r\nthe boreal, occupying different parts of it; in other words, the\r\nattractions and repulsions externally exerted by a magnet are exactly\r\nthe same as if they proceeded from a very thin stratum of each fluid\r\noccupying the surface only, both fluids being in equal quantities,\r\nand so distributed that their total action upon all the points in the\r\ninterior of the body is equal to nothing. Since the resulting force is\r\nthe difference of the two polarities, its intensity must be greatly\r\ninferior to that of either” (J. C. Wilcke at A.D. 1757, “Conn.\r\nof the Phys. Sci.,” 1846, s. 30 pp. 308, 309).\r\n\r\nThe “Mémoires de l’Institut” for 1811 contain Poisson’s very able\r\npapers showing the manner in which electricity is distributed on the\r\nsurfaces of bodies of various figures and the thickness of the stratum\r\nof electricity existing throughout these bodies. Mrs. Somerville\r\nfurther observes of work already cited (s. 28):\r\n\r\n“Although the distribution of the electric fluid has employed the\r\neminent analytical talents of M. Poisson and M. Ivory, and though many\r\nof their computed phenomena have been confirmed by observation, yet\r\nrecent experiments show that the subject is still involved in much\r\ndifficulty. Electricity is entirely confined to the surface of bodies;\r\nor, if it does penetrate their substance, the depth is inappreciable;\r\nso that the quantity bodies are capable of receiving does not follow\r\nthe proportion of their bulk, but depends principally upon the form\r\nand extent of surface over which it is spread; thus the exterior may\r\nbe positively or negatively electric, while the interior is in a state\r\nof perfect neutrality.” (Consult J. Farrar, “Elem. of Elect. Magn. and\r\nElectro-Magn.,” 1826, pp. 50–56.)\r\n\r\nIn his treatment of the theories of magnetism, Brewster alludes\r\nagain to the masterly investigations of Poisson, who, says he,\r\nappears to have been “the first to conceive the idea of absolute\r\nmagnetic measurement.” In a short but luminous article at the end of\r\nthe “Connaissance des Temps” for 1828, he describes the method for\r\nobtaining the value of H[ symbol] in absolute measure. His first\r\nand second “Mémoire sur la Théorie du Magnétisme” appeared during\r\n1824–1825, at pp. 247, 488, Vol. V of the Transactions of the Paris\r\nRoyal Academy, and were closely followed (Vol. VI. p. 441) by his\r\nMemoir on the theory of Magnetism in motion. _Translations_ of\r\nthese will be found at pp. 336–358, 373, Vol. I and pp. 328–330, Vol. V\r\nof the _Edin. Jour. of Sci._ and at pp. 334, 335 of John Farrar’s\r\n“Elem. of Elect. Magn. and Electro-Mag.,” all published during the year\r\n1826.\r\n\r\nPoisson’s theoretical prediction of magne-crystallic action is thus\r\nalluded to by Dr. John Tyndall in his “Researches on Diamagnetism,”\r\netc., London, 1870, pp. 13 and 66, 67:\r\n\r\n“In March 1851, Professor William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) drew attention\r\nto an exceedingly remarkable instance of theoretic foresight on the\r\npart of Poisson, with reference to the possibility of magne-crystallic\r\naction.\r\n\r\n“Poisson,” says Sir William, “in his mathematical theory of\r\nmagnetic induction founded on the hypothesis of magnetic fluids\r\n(moving within the infinitely small magnetic elements), of which he\r\nassumes magnetizable matter to be constituted, does not overlook\r\nthe possibility of those magnetic elements being non-spherical and\r\nsymmetrically arranged in crystalline matter, and he remarks that\r\na finite spherical portion of such a substance would, when in the\r\nneighbourhood of a magnet, act differently according to the different\r\npositions into which it might be turned with its centre tube fixed.\r\nBut (such a circumstance not having yet been observed), he excludes\r\nthe consideration of the structure which would lead to it from his\r\nresearches, and confines himself in his theory of magnetic induction\r\nto the case of matter consisting either of spherical magnetic elements\r\nor of non-symmetrically disposed elements of any forms. Now, however,\r\nwhen a recent discovery of Plucker’s has established the very\r\ncircumstance, the observation of which was wanting to induce Poisson to\r\nenter upon a full treatment of the subject, the importance of working\r\nout a magnetical theory of magnetic induction is obvious.\r\n\r\n“Sir William Thomson then proceeds to make the necessary ‘extension of\r\nPoisson’s Mathematical Theory of Magnetic Induction,’ and he publishes\r\na striking quotation from the ‘Mémoires de l’Institut,’ 1821–1822,\r\nParis, 1826.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Biography in “English Encycl.,” Vol. IV. p.\r\n   899; _Phil.

He suggests the use of but two wires, and of two piles of\r\nunequal power. With these, all desired characters could be transmitted,\r\nthrough a preconcerted code regarding the meaning of such letters and\r\nfigures as would be represented by the weaker or the stronger pile, in\r\nconjunction with the duration of the gas evolutions or the space of\r\ntime separating them. He also suggested, for an alarum, the use of a\r\npistol, by connecting a battery to the pile, in lieu of liberating an\r\nalarm by means of accumulated gas as Sömmering had done.\r\n\r\nTwo months after Oersted’s great discovery, which was announced in July\r\n1820, Schweigger read at Halle (September 16, 1820) and communicated\r\nto the German _Literary Gazette_ (No. 296 for November 1820), a paper\r\nrelative to an important improvement made in his _galvano magnetic\r\nindicator_. The latter, which had been described at pp. 206–208 of\r\nGehlen’s (1808) _Journal für Chemie_, was merely an electroscope,\r\nemployed to indicate the attraction and repulsion of ordinary\r\nfrictional electricity in lieu of a Coulomb balance, the improved\r\napparatus being the result of his discovery that, by coiling an\r\n_insulated_ wire several times around a magnetic needle, the deflecting\r\npower of the voltaic current increases with the number of turns (Kuhn,\r\n“Ang. Elek.-Lehre,” p. 514).\r\n\r\nAlluding to Schweigger’s multiplier, the Abbé Moigno says:\r\n\r\n“A conducting wire twisted upon itself and forming one hundred turns\r\nwill, when traversed by the same current, produce an effect one hundred\r\ntimes greater than a wire with a single turn: provided always that the\r\nelectric fluid pass through circumvolutions of the wire without passing\r\nlaterally from one contour to another” (_Cornhill Magazine_, Vol. II\r\nfor 1860, pp. 61, 64).\r\n\r\nIt was, however, shown by Dr. Seebeck that the power of multiplication\r\ndoes not increase with the number of windings in the uniting wire, for\r\nthe resistance to transmission naturally increases with the length of\r\nthe wire, thus diminishing its conducting power.\r\n\r\nTo his new instrument Schweigger gave the name of _electro-magnetic\r\nmultiplier_ (_multiplicator_) or _galvanometer multiplier_, and it has\r\nbecome the most important for indicating and measuring the strength of\r\nthe galvanic current.\r\n\r\nProf. W. B. Rogers says that Schweigger’s apparatus as improved by\r\nNobili (_Ital. Soc. Mem._, Vol. XX. p. 173) became indispensable in\r\nthe measurement of current electricity, and that through the later\r\nimprovements given it by Sir William Thomson (also by Du Bois Reymond),\r\nit has been made one of the most perfect and delicate of all known\r\nmeans of measuring force. Schweigger’s multipliers with improvements\r\nmade thereon by Oersted and Nobili are illustrated at p. 642, Vol. XXI\r\nof the eighth “Ency. Britannica,” where reference is made to drawings\r\non a large scale shown at Plate 522, article “Thermo-Electricity,” of\r\nthe “Edinburgh Encyclopædia.”\r\n\r\nAccording to a footnote, p. 273 of “Report Smithsonian Inst.” for\r\n1878, Schweigger’s multiplier is alluded to in the “Additions to\r\nOersted’s Electroma-gnetic Experiments,” a memoir read at the\r\n_Naturforschende Gesellschaft_ at Halle, September 16 and November\r\n4, 1820. An abstract of this paper was published in the _Allgemeine\r\nLiteratur-Zeitung_ of Halle (4to), November 1820, No. 296, Vol.\r\nIII. col. 621–624, whilst the full memoir appeared in the _Journal\r\nfür Chemie und Physik_, 1821, Vol. XXXI. pp. 1–17; and “Additional\r\nRemarks ...” by Dr. Schweigger, in the same volume, pp. 35–41. It is\r\nfurther stated in the afore-mentioned note that:\r\n\r\n“A galvanometer of somewhat different form, having a vertical helix\r\nand employing an unmagnetized needle, was very shortly afterward\r\nindependently devised by Johann Christian Poggendorff, of Berlin;\r\nand as he preceded Schweigger in publishing an account of it, he is\r\nsometimes regarded as the original inventor. Schweigger designated his\r\ndevice an ‘Electro-magnetic Multiplicator’; Poggendorff designated\r\nhis arrangement a ‘Galvano-magnetic Condensator.’ Prof. Oersted\r\nremarks: ‘Immediately after the discovery of electro-magnetism, M.\r\nSchweigger, professor at Halle, invented an apparatus admirably\r\nadapted for exhibiting by means of the magnetic needle the feeblest\r\nelectric currents.... M. Poggendorff, a distinguished young savant,\r\nof Berlin, constructed an electro-magnetic multiplier very shortly\r\nafter M. Schweigger, with which he made some striking experiments. M.\r\nPoggendorff’s work having been cited in a book on electro-magnetism by\r\nthe celebrated M. Erman (published immediately after the discovery of\r\nthese phenomena), became known to several philosophers before that of\r\nM. Schweigger’ (_Annales de Chimie et de Physique_, 1823, Vol.\r\nXXII. pp. 358–360).\r\n\r\n“The researches of Schweigger and Bart leave us little or no doubt\r\nthat the ancients were well acquainted with the mutual attraction of\r\niron and the lodestone, as well as with the positive and negative\r\nproperties of electricity, by whatever name they may have called it.\r\nThe reciprocal magnetic relations to the planetary orbs, which are all\r\nmagnets, was with them an accepted fact, and aerolites were not only\r\ncalled by them magnetic stones, but used in the Mysteries for purposes\r\nto which we now apply the magnet.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Isis Unveiled,” Vol. I. pp. 281, 282.

Ph._,\r\nBand X. heft i. for 1814.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1811.=--Monsieur Dessaignes is first to establish a relation\r\nbetween electricity and phosphorescence, as is shown in the extract\r\npublished in London from the Memoir which he had presented two years\r\nbefore to the French Institute. The general view he takes is that\r\nphosphorescence is produced by a particular fluid, which is set in\r\nmotion by light, by heat, by electricity, as well as by friction, and\r\nthat it is dissipated by overheating or by too long exposure to light.\r\n\r\nIt is asserted by Fahie (“Hist. of El. Tel.,” pp. xiv, 297) that it was\r\nDessaignes and not Seebeck who first discovered thermo-electricity.\r\n“Dessaignes,” he says, “showed us how difference of temperature or\r\nheat could produce electricity.” This was in 1815, or six years before\r\nSeebeck, who is always credited with the observation (Bostock’s\r\n“History of Galvanism,” London, 1818, p. 101). Many observations\r\nbearing on _thermo-electricity_ had been made even long before\r\nDessaignes.... In 1759 Æpinus called attention to the same phenomena,\r\nand pointed out that electricity of opposite kinds was developed at\r\nopposite ends of the crystal (tourmaline). In 1760 Canton observed the\r\nsame properties in the topaz; and between 1789 and 1791 Haüy showed the\r\nthermo-electric properties of various other substances, as mesotype,\r\nprehnite, Iceland spar, and boracite.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Priestley’s “History of Electricity,” 1767, pp.\r\n   314–326.

Mr. William\r\nSturgeon, who mentions the fact (“Lectures of Electricity,” London,\r\n1842, p. 208), adds that Mr. Harris “has formed the conductors into\r\nstrips of copper, which are inserted in grooves in the after side of\r\nthe masts from top to bottom and through the keelson to the sea. In\r\none of the smaller men-of-war Mr. Harris carried his mizzen conductor\r\nthrough the powder magazine!!! The evils attending these conductors\r\narise principally from lateral explosions and electro-magnetic\r\ninfluence.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--For Wm. Sturgeon, consult _Phil.

Other observations previously carried on by Schübler,\r\nduring 1805 and subsequent years, at Ellvanguen and Stuttgart are\r\ndetailed at pp. 579, 580, Vol. VIII--and are also alluded to in article\r\n“Meteorology”--of the eighth “Britannica.”\r\n\r\nWhile De Lor was the first to observe, in 1752, the existence of\r\nelectricity in the atmosphere, even when no lightning is visible,\r\nSchübler made the earliest known report upon the daily periodicity\r\nof the intensity of the electricity. The annual periodicity had been\r\npreviously demonstrated by G. B. Beccaria, who published at Turin two\r\nable treatises on the subject during 1769 and 1775.\r\n\r\nThe origin of atmospheric electricity was, by Lavoisier, Laplace and\r\nSir H. Davy, attributed in great part to the constant combustion\r\ntaking place upon the earth’s surface. Volta and Saussure believed it\r\nto arise from the process of evaporation, while Pouillet pointed out\r\nthe influence of the processes of vegetation; Reich, however, showed\r\nthat as neither developed electricity they could not produce it in\r\nthe atmosphere. Peltier advanced the theory that mere evaporation\r\nwithout chemical action is not enough, and the experiments of Faraday\r\nand Armstrong showed that evaporation without friction is likewise\r\ninsufficient. These theories are treated of in “Gaea-Natur und Leben,”\r\nKöln and Leipzig, 1873, p. 322, and in Lardner’s “Popular Lectures,”\r\n1859, Vol. II. pp. 149–160. The last named gives tables of many\r\nobservations, and reports, among other matters, that the series of\r\nobservations on the diurnal changes of atmospheric electricity which\r\nSchübler made, in 1811–1812, were repeated and confirmed at Paris in\r\n1830 by M. Arago. During the month of March 1811 Schübler found that\r\nthe mean time of the morning maximum was eight hours thirty minutes,\r\nand M. Arago ascertained the mean time for the same month to be eight\r\nhours forty-eight minutes.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Edin. Jour. of Sci._, new series, Vol. III;\r\n   _Biblio.

In a quiescent state, it had the appearance\r\nof a circular cloud, revolving on the water like a horizontal wheel,\r\nin various and irregular involutions, expanding itself gradually on\r\nthe lee side, when suddenly a column of the blackest cinders, ashes,\r\nand stones, would shoot up in the form of a spire, rapidly succeeded\r\nby others, each acquiring greater velocity and breaking into various\r\nbranches resembling a group of pines; these again forming themselves\r\ninto festoons of white feathery smoke. During these bursts, the most\r\nvivid flashes of lightning continually issued from the densest portion\r\nof the volcano, and the columns rolled off in large masses of fleecy\r\nclouds, gradually expanding themselves before the wind, in a direction\r\nnearly horizontal, and drawing up a quantity of water spouts, which\r\nformed a striking addition to the scene. In less than an hour, a peak\r\nwas visible, and, in three hours from the time of our arrival, the\r\nvolcano then being four hours old, a crater was formed twenty feet\r\nhigh, and from four to five hundred feet in diameter. The eruptions\r\nwere attended by a noise like the firing of cannon and musketry mixed;\r\nas also with shocks of earthquakes sufficient to throw down a large\r\npart of the cliff on which we stood.” (See description of the sudden\r\nappearance of the Island of St. Michael, etc., in Lectures by Dr.\r\nWebster, Professor of Chemistry and Mineralogy at Harvard College,\r\nBoston, 1822.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1811–1818.=--Ure (Andrew), M.D., F.R.S., the first astronomer\r\nappointed to the Glasgow Observatory and the author of a Dictionary of\r\nChemistry (the undisputed standard until the appearance of a similar\r\nwork by Henry Watts), makes known the result of his electrical\r\nexperiments in the same line as those made by Aldini (A.D. 1793) upon\r\nthe body of a recently executed criminal. Noad, who gives a greatly\r\ndetailed account of the investigations, at pp. 338–341 of his “Manual,”\r\nremarks that they “serve to convey a tolerably accurate idea of the\r\nwonderful physiological effects of the electrical agent, and will be\r\nimpressive from their conveying the most terrific expressions of human\r\npassion and human agony.”\r\n\r\nDr. Ure is the inventor of an improved eudiometer, for detonating\r\nor exploding gases by means of an electric shock or spark, which is\r\nfully described and illustrated in the “Electricity” article of the\r\n“Britannica.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--De la Rive, “Treatise on Electricity,” Vol. II.\r\n   pp. 489–490, also “Encycl.

Brit.,” article on “Voltaic Electricity,” also in\r\n   No. 12 of the _Journal Sci. and Arts_, and at p. 56, Vol. LIII\r\n   of the _Philosophical Magazine_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1812.=--Through the _New York Columbian_, of July 1812, Mr.\r\nChristopher Colles informs the public that the operation of his new\r\ntelegraphs “will be shown from the top of the Custom House on Tuesdays,\r\nThursdays and Saturdays from four to six o’clock in the afternoon.”\r\n\r\nIn an explanatory pamphlet, he states that “eighty-four letters can\r\nbe exhibited by this machine in five minutes, to the distance of one\r\ntelegraphic station averaged at ten miles, and by the same proportion a\r\ndistance of 2600 miles in fifteen minutes, twenty-eight seconds.”\r\n\r\nJames D. Reid, who mentions this fact at p. 5 of his “Telegraph in\r\nAmerica,” says that the above was nothing but the already well-known\r\nEuropean semaphore or visual signal, and that Colles worked his\r\n“machine” between New York and Sandy Hook for several years.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1812.=--On April 1 and 15, May 13 and June 17, Mr. M. Donovan,\r\nsecretary of the Kirwanian Society of Dublin, reads before the latter\r\nbody a long communication “On the Inadequacy of the Hypothesis\r\nat Present Received to Account for (explain) the Phenomena of\r\nElectricity,” which was afterward ably criticized by J. A. de Luc,\r\nas will be seen by reference to the _Philosophical Magazine_, Vols.\r\nXLV. pp. 97, 200, 329–332, and XLVI. pp. 13, 14. In his treatment of\r\nEeles’ hypothesis (see A.D. 1755) Donovan gives some attention to the\r\ndesigned suppression by Priestley of Eeles’ valuable papers from the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_.\r\n\r\nThe above communication was followed by still more valuable and much\r\nlonger ones, read by Mr. Donovan before the same society, February 22,\r\nMarch 8, and March 22, 1815, entitled “On the Origin, Progress and\r\nPresent State of Galvanism ... and Inadequacy of the Hypotheses to\r\nExplain Its Phenomena ...” a modified form of which obtained for its\r\nauthor the prize of the Irish Royal Society.\r\n\r\nThe sketch of the history of galvanism is divided into three periods.\r\nThe first treats of the discoveries attaching to muscular contraction,\r\nand alludes to the observations of Sulzer, Galvani, Fabbroni,\r\nHumboldt, Pfaff, Fontana, Valli, Monro, Vassalli-Eandi, Fowler, Smuck,\r\nMarsigli, Grapengieser, Giulio, Rossi, Aldini and Wells. The second\r\nperiod reviews the gradual development of the physical and chemical\r\npower of combined galvanic arrangements, beginning with Nicholson and\r\nCarlisle, and refers to the many conclusions reached by Cruikshanks,\r\nHenry, Haldane, Ritter, Robertson, Brugnatelli, Fourcroy, Vauquelin,\r\nThénard, Lehot, Trommsdorff, Simon, Helwige (Major Helvig), Twast,\r\nBourguet, Erman, Grapengieser, Wollaston, Davy, Pfaff, Van Marum,\r\nBiot, Cuvier, Desormes, Bostock, Cuthbertson, Aldini, Lagrave, Jordan,\r\nRitter and Wilkinson. The third period commences with the well-known\r\ngeneralizations of the chemical effects of galvanism made by Hisinger\r\nand Berzelius; their experiments on the invisible transfer of elements\r\nat a distance, and the explanation given by Grotthus of the invisible\r\ntransfer of the elements of water. Following this, Donovan alludes\r\nto the announced decomposition of muriatic acid by W. Peel, Francis\r\nPacchiani, and others, as well as the discovery of the source of\r\nmistakes in the Galvani Society investigations by Pfaff, Biot, Thénard\r\nand Davy; after which reference is made to the special observations\r\nof Sylvester, Grotthus, Wilson, Erman, Davy, Pontin, Gay-Lussac and\r\nThénard, Children, De Luc, Singer, Murray and Maycock.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of April 1815, Donovan reviewed the hypotheses of Volta and\r\nFabbroni, as well as of the British philosophers Wollaston, Bostock\r\nand Davy, and, on the 19th of the same month, he read an additional\r\npaper on the inadequacy of the galvanic hypothesis, having previously\r\n(Dec. 28, 1814, and Jan. 11, 1815) presented to the Kirwanian Society a\r\ncommunication relative to a new theory of Galvanism.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Phil.

He dispenses entirely with the zinc plates of De Luc and employs\r\nonly discs of paper having one side tinned and the other coated with a\r\nthin layer of black oxide of manganese pulverized in a mixture of flour\r\nand milk (“Note historique sur les piles sèches,” _Annales de Chimie et\r\nde Physique_, Vol. XI. p. 190).\r\n\r\nHis pile terminates in metallic plates, compressing the paper discs\r\nby means of silk ligatures, and the column is insulated by giving it\r\na coating of either sulphur or shellac. In this apparatus the tinned\r\nsurface is the positive element, the negative being the oxide of\r\nmanganese, which replaces M. De Luc’s Dutch gilt paper. In the later\r\nforms of Zamboni’s pile the discs were formed of gilt and silvered\r\npaper pasted back to back. William Sturgeon remarks (“Scientific\r\nResearches,” Bury, 1850, p. 200) that the Zamboni piles are those which\r\nhave been the most securely protected against the action of the ambient\r\nair and which alone have maintained their original electrical intensity.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Larousse, “Dict.

This was\r\nlaid both underground and under the sea, and, it is asserted that, by\r\nmeans of an arrangement of charcoal points, he was enabled to explode\r\npowder mines across the Neva, near St. Petersburg, as well as also\r\nacross the Seine, during the occupation of Paris by the allied armies.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Hamel, “Bull.

Am. Suppl.,” No. 405).\r\nHamel states (at p. 41 of Cooke’s reprint) that one of his contrivances\r\nwas exhibited to the Emperor Alexander as early as 1825. Of this,\r\nDr. E. N. Dickerson, in his Henry Memorial Address before Princeton\r\nCollege, gives the date as 1824. Be that as it may, it was only after\r\nhis return from China in 1832 (two years after Sömmering’s death)\r\nthat, following Ampère’s suggestion as to the availment of Oersted’s\r\ndiscovery, he submitted the apparatus which established for him the\r\ncredit of having invented the electro-magnetic telegraph.\r\n\r\nMany authors have erroneously described Schilling’s apparatus as\r\nconsisting of a number of platinum wires insulated and bound together\r\nwith a silken cord which put in motion thirty-six magnetic needles\r\nplaced vertically in the centre of the multiplier by means of a species\r\nof key connecting with a galvanic pile. This account appeared at p.\r\n43 of the “Journal des Travaux de l’Acad. de l’Industrie Française”\r\nfor March 1839. The fact is that he employed but one magnetic needle\r\nand multiplier, with two leading wires, as proposed by Fechner, and\r\nwas enabled by means of a combination of the deflections of the needle\r\nto the right and left to give all necessary signals for a complete\r\ncorrespondence by changing the poles of the battery at the ends of\r\nthe wires. His call signal was given by a bell in connection with a\r\nclockwork, released by the deflection of a magnet.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--For a detailed explanation of the working of\r\n   Schilling’s telegraph, J. S. T. Gehler’s “Physikalisches\r\n   Wörterbuch” for 1838, Vol. IX. p. 111; Fahie’s “History,” pp.\r\n   310–313; “Sc. Am. Suppl.,” No. 405, p. 6467.\r\n\r\nFrom the account of the telegraphic collection at the 1873 Exposition,\r\npublished by Dr. Edward Zetzsche in the “Austellungblatte” of the\r\nVienna “Neue Freie Presse,” the following is extracted: “Even after\r\nProf. Oersted, of Copenhagen, had observed the deviation of a magnetic\r\nneedle under the influence of the current, neither the proposition\r\nof Ampère, at Paris, in 1820 (of employing thirty needles and sixty\r\nwires) nor that of Fechner, at Leipzig, in 1829 (twenty-four needles\r\nand forty-eight wires) gave any impulse to telegraphy. Only in 1832 did\r\nthe Russian Councillor of State, Baron Schilling de Kannstadt (who had\r\nseen the telegraph of his friend Sömmering, and had made it known in\r\nRussia), invent a new instrument with but five wires, which number he\r\nsubsequently reduced to one. In it, the movements of the needle were\r\nrendered more perceptible by means of little discs of paper attached\r\nto a silk thread, holding the needle in suspension. This telegraph, it\r\nis true, was not put in application on a large scale, for Schilling\r\ndied in 1837, but, on the 23rd of Sept. 1835, he had already brought\r\nout his apparatus at Bonn and at Frankfort-on-the-Main, where it was\r\nseen amongst other persons by Prof. Muncke, who doubtless constructed a\r\nsimilar one which he took with him to Heidelberg.”\r\n\r\nIt was only one year before his death that Schilling succeeded in\r\nobtaining the support of the Russian Government for his telegraph,\r\nand it was only after Muncke had shown it (March 6, 1836) to Wm.\r\nFothergill Cooke, then a student in medicine at Heidelberg, that the\r\nlatter produced his needle telegraph, which was followed by Cooke and\r\nWheatstone’s still more perfect instrument in 1837 (Prime’s “Life of\r\nMorse,” pp. 265, 276). Some improvements in Schilling’s so-called\r\ndeflective telegraph had, in the meantime, been made by Gauss and Weber\r\nat Göttingen, as well as by Steinheil at Munich.\r\n\r\nPrior to his visiting Bonn (Meeting of Naturalists--Isis, Nog., 1836)\r\nSchilling had taken the working model of his telegraph to Vienna, where\r\nhe made many experiments with it in conjunction with Baron Jacquin and\r\nwith Prof. Andreas von Ettinghausen. Upon his return home from Germany\r\nin 1836, he declined invitations made him to bring his instruments to\r\nEngland (Dr. Hamel’s St. Petersburg lecture on “The Telegraph and Baron\r\nPaul Schilling”), whilst, by direction of the Russian Commission of\r\nInquiry, he set up an experimental telegraph in two chambers of the\r\nPalace of the Admiralty connecting the apparatus by a long line over\r\nground and by a cable laid in the waters of the canal. The results\r\nproved so satisfactory that in May 1837 the Emperor Nicholas ordered\r\na submarine line to be laid between St. Petersburg and Cronstadt.\r\nSchilling’s death, on the 25th of July following, prevented, however,\r\nthe execution of the project.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Biography in _Sci.

T. Riess and L. Moser, are detailed at p. 48 of Brewster’s\r\n(1837) “Treatise on Magnetism.” At p. 12 of his article (Vol. XIV of\r\nthe eighth “Britannica”), Sir David Brewster states that Morichini’s\r\nexperiments were successfully repeated by both Dr. Carpi at Rome and\r\nthe Marquis Ridolfi at Florence; but M. d’Hombre Firmas, at Alais,\r\nin France; Prof. Pietro Configliachi, of Pavia, and M. Berard, of\r\nMontpelier, failed in obtaining decided effects from the violet rays.\r\nIn 1814 Morichini exhibited the actual experiment to Sir Humphry Davy,\r\nand in 1817 Dr. Carpi showed it to Prof. Playfair. A few months later\r\nSir David Brewster met Davy at Geneva, and learned from him the fact\r\nthat he had paid the most diligent attention to one of Morichini’s\r\nexperiments, and that he had actually seen with his own eyes an\r\nunmagnetized needle rendered magnetic by violet light.

He says:\r\n\r\n“Without the slightest wish to throw a doubt over the originality of\r\nMr. Sömmering’s invention, I beg leave to mention that an experiment,\r\nshowing the advantages to be obtained from the application of the\r\ncertain and rapid motion of the electric principle through an extensive\r\nvoltaic circuit to the purpose of the ordinary telegraph, was exhibited\r\nby me before the Right Hon. the Lords of the Admiralty, in the\r\nbeginning of February 1813.”\r\n\r\nIt is said that the Lords of the Admiralty spoke approvingly of it, but\r\nstated that as the war was over, and money scarce, they could not carry\r\nit into effect (_Saturday Review_ for August 21, 1858, p. 190).\r\n\r\nRonalds says (“Catal.,” p. 473):\r\n\r\n“No description of this telegraph appears to have been printed. It was\r\nmentioned at the Admiralty after the invention and full description of\r\nSömmering’s, described fully and with figures in the Denkschriften of\r\nthe Academy of Munich for 1809–1810, issued in 1811.”\r\n\r\nMr. Benjamin Sharpe, nephew of J. R. Sharpe, is the author of “A\r\nTreatise on the Construction and Submersion of Deep-Sea Electric\r\nTelegraph Cables,” London, 1861, wherein he alludes to the above, and\r\nasserts that his uncle “conveyed signals a distance of seven miles\r\nunder water” (Fahie’s “History,” pp. 244–246; _Sci. Am. Supp._,\r\nNo. 404, pp. 6, 446).\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1813.=--Deleuze (Joseph Philippe François), French\r\nphysician, publishes his “Histoire Critique du Magnétisme Animal,”\r\ncontaining the result of observations made by him during the previous\r\ntwenty-five years upon animal magnetism.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Allen Thomson, of the University of Glasgow, Deleuze\r\nbelieved in the existence of an all-pervading magnetic fluid. This\r\nfluid, says he, is under the control of the will, and is constantly\r\nescaping from our bodies, forming around them an atmosphere, which,\r\nhaving no determinate current, does not act sensibly on the person near\r\nus; but, when urged and directed by our volition, it moves with all\r\nthe force which we impress upon it; it is moved like the luminous rays\r\nemitted by substances in a state of combustion. The chief difference\r\nbetween the Deleuze and Puységur schools has reference to the various\r\nmodes in which the magnetic fluid should be brought into action, and\r\nthe suitable occasions for its employment.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1815 the Magnetic Society was established in Paris,\r\nwith M. De Puységur as its president and M. Deleuze as vice-president,\r\nbut it expired in 1820. In 1819 M. Deleuze had published his “Défense\r\ndu Magnétisme Animal,” in reply to the attack made upon the subject\r\nby M. Virey through the “Dictionnaire des Sciences Médicales,” and he\r\nwas followed, more particularly, by M. Bertrand, who issued in 1823\r\nhis “Traité du Somnambulisme,” and in 1826 his still more important\r\nwork, “Du Magnétisme Animal en France,” etc. Respecting the last named\r\nDeleuze says:\r\n\r\n“Of all the attacks directed against magnetism up to the present\r\nday, this is the most powerful, the most imposing, and the most ably\r\ncombined. The author is a man of genius, etc. He has been occupied\r\nwith magnetism for some years. He has joined its practice to that of\r\nmedicine, and he has even taught its doctrines in public lectures.\r\nA more attentive examination and new experiments have dissuaded him\r\nfrom a belief which he himself propagated; he undertakes to undeceive\r\nothers, and to prove that magnetism is a mere chimera. Certainly his\r\nconviction must be very strong.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Article “Somnambulism,” in the “Britannica,” more\r\n   especially for a review of, and extracts from, Deleuze’s great\r\n   work, also the translation of the latter by T.

In like experiments subsequently made\r\nby Golding Bird, coagulation took place in the positive vessel, while\r\nnone occurred in the negative; after a time the contents of the former\r\nhad an acid taste, and of the latter a caustic alkaline flavour. When\r\nall in the positive vessel was coagulated by the galvanic action, he\r\nfound there hydrochloric acid mixed with chlorine and the alkali in the\r\nnegative vessel.\r\n\r\nHe also repeated the experiments of Davy on the light developed by\r\ncharcoal points connected with a powerful galvanic battery, and found\r\nthat this light was as effectual as solar light in decomposing muriate\r\nof silver and other bodies, and in acting upon hydrogen and chlorine\r\ngases, causing them to detonate, but he could not produce the same\r\neffect by the moon’s rays or by any other light.\r\n\r\nThe electricity developed in flame, which had received much attention\r\nfrom Paul Erman and others, was likewise investigated by Prof. Brande,\r\nwhose conclusions are to be found detailed at Sec. III. chap. iii.\r\npart i. of the “Electricity” article in the “Encyclopædia Britannica.”\r\nTherein is recalled the fact that A. L. Lavoisier, P. S. Laplace and\r\nAless. Volta previously obtained clear indications of electricity by\r\nthe combustion of charcoal, while H. B. de Saussure failed to develop\r\nelectricity either by the combustion or explosion of gunpowder, and\r\nHumphry Davy could not obtain it through the combustion of charcoal\r\nor of iron in air or in pure oxygen. In the above-named article will\r\nalso be found an account of the investigations of Pouillet and of\r\nBecquerel in the same line; some of the other well-known scientists\r\nwho have treated more or less directly upon the subject being E.

It is also to be found illustrated at p.\r\n81, Vol. XIV of the eighth “Britannica,” wherein it is said that he\r\nemployed it in the valuable series of magnetic observations made by him\r\nbetween the years 1813 and 1821. It consists of a telescope, underneath\r\nthe axis of which is a magnetic needle whose position is alterable in\r\norder to indicate the exact angle of deviation, or the declination of\r\nthe needle from the true meridian.\r\n\r\nBrewster states (eighth “Brit.,” Vol. XIV. p. 54) that when the diurnal\r\nvariation of the needle was first discovered it was supposed to have\r\nonly two changes in its movements during the day. About 7 a.m. its\r\nnorth end began to deviate to the west, and about 2 p.m. it reached\r\nits maximum westerly deviation. It then returned to the eastward to\r\nits first position, and remained stationary till it again resumed its\r\nwesterly course in the following morning. When magnetic observations\r\nbecame more accurate, it was found that the diurnal movement commences\r\nmuch earlier than 7 a.m., but its motion is to the east. At 7.30\r\na.m. it reaches its greatest easterly deviation, and then begins its\r\nmovement to the west till 2 p.m. It then returns to the eastward till\r\nthe evening, when it has again a slight westerly motion; and in the\r\ncourse of the night, or early in the morning, it reaches the point\r\nfrom which it set out twenty-four hours before. The most accurate\r\nobservations made in England were those of Colonel Beaufoy, when the\r\nvariation was about 24½´ west. In these the absolute maxima were\r\nearlier than in Canton’s observations, and the second maximum west\r\nabout 11 p.m. Dr. Thomas Thomson alludes to the diurnal investigations\r\nof Barlow and Christie and others, and gives (“Outline of the\r\nSciences,” London, 1830, pp. 543–550) a table of the mean monthly\r\nvariation of the compass from April 1817 to March 1819 as determined\r\nby Colonel Beaufoy. Mr. Peter Barlow, he says, has given in his “Essay\r\non Magnetic Attractions” a very ingenious and plausible explanation of\r\nthe daily variation by supposing the sun to possess a certain magnetic\r\naction on the needle.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Phil.

Mag._ regarding\r\nEzekiel Walker’s theory of combustion as deduced from galvanic\r\nphenomena. Murray thinks there is much obscurity in Mr. Walker’s\r\nsolution, which arises “from his using indiscriminately the terms\r\nheat (caloric) and combustion. Now caloric (the matter of heat) and\r\ncombustion (the act of ignition) are not identical. What may be\r\ncollected, however, from the general tenor of that paper is the theory\r\nof Lavoisier in a new dress.”\r\n\r\nAt p. 17 of this same volume is a paper from Mr. John Webster on the\r\nagency of electricity in contributing the peculiar properties of bodies\r\nand producing combustion, while, at p. 20, is a letter from Mr. George\r\nJ.

Of its construction or mode of action he\r\nappears, however, to have left no particulars.\r\n\r\nAt pp. 178 and 180 of “The Wedgwoods ...” by Llewellyn Jewett, London,\r\n1865, appears the following:\r\n\r\n“This Thomas Wedgwood was, I believe, cousin to Josiah, being son\r\nof Aaron Wedgwood, etc., etc. ... He was a man of high scientific\r\nattainments, and has the reputation of being the first inventor of the\r\nelectric telegraph (afterward so ably carried out by his son Ralph)\r\nand of many other valuable works.... In 1806 Ralph Wedgwood established\r\nhimself at Charing Cross, and soon afterward his whole attention began\r\nto be engrossed with his scheme of the electric telegraph, which in\r\nthe then unsettled state of the kingdom--in the midst of war, it must\r\nbe remembered--he considered would be of the utmost importance to the\r\ngovernment. In 1814, having perfected his scheme, he submitted his\r\nproposals to Lord Castlereagh, and most anxiously waited the result\r\n... was informed that ‘the war being at an end, the old system was\r\nsufficient for the country.’ The plan, therefore, fell to the ground,\r\nuntil Prof. Wheatstone, in happier and more enlightened times, again\r\nbrought up the subject with such eminent success. The plan thus brought\r\nforward by Ralph Wedgwood, in 1814, and of which, as I have stated,\r\nhe received the first idea from his father, was described by him in a\r\npamphlet, entitled ‘An Address to the Public on the Advantages of a\r\nProposed Introduction of the Stylographic Principle of Writing Into\r\nGeneral Use; And Also an Improved Species of Telegraphy, Calculated for\r\nthe Use of the Public, as Well as for the Government.’”\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet is dated May 29, 1815.

Mr. Singer remarks that\r\nhis arrangement so effectually precludes moisture that some of the\r\n“electrometers constructed in 1810 and which have never yet (1814)\r\nbeen warmed or wiped, have still apparently the same insulating power\r\nas at first.” The use of this apparatus is strongly recommended by Dr.\r\nFaraday, whose instructions for the use of electrometers are given at\r\ngreat length at pp. 617–619, Vol. VIII of the eighth “Britannica.”\r\n\r\nAfter describing the above-named electrometer, Mr. William Sturgeon\r\nremarks (“Lectures,” London, 1842, pp. 42, 43):\r\n\r\n“It is frequently exceedingly difficult, without extensive reading, to\r\nconfer the merit that is due to invention on the right party, and even\r\nthen we sometimes err for want of proper information. Mr. Singer has\r\nhitherto, with most writers, had the exclusive merit of insulating the\r\naxial wire of the electroscope from the brass cap, by a glass tube; and\r\nit would appear from the description he gives of this improvement in\r\nhis excellent treatise on electricity that he was not aware of anything\r\nof the kind being previously done. It appears, however, by an article\r\nof Mr. Erman in the _Journal de Physique_, Vol. LIX. p. 98, and\r\n_Nicholson’s Journal_, Vol. X, published in 1805, that a Mr. Weiss\r\nhad applied the glass tube for the purpose of insulating the axial wire\r\nof Bennet’s electroscope. The account runs thus: ‘The electrometer he\r\n(Mr. Erman) used was that distinguished in Germany as the electrometer\r\nof Weiss.’ From this it would appear to have been long known. ‘The\r\nlength of its leaves of gold is half an inch, and the diameter of the\r\nglass cylinder which encloses them is three-quarters of an inch, the\r\nheight being an inch and a half. Its cover of ivory does not project\r\nabove the glass, and is perforated in the middle with a hole in which\r\na _smaller glass tube is fixed, and through this last tube passes\r\nthe metallic rod that serves to suspend the gold leaves_.’ Singer’s\r\nimprovement, first published in 1814, would, therefore, consist in\r\nadding the brass ferrule, which covers the glass tube first introduced\r\nby Weiss.”\r\n\r\nSinger is also the inventor of one of the best-known amalgams for the\r\ncushions of the electric machine. It is described at p. 536, Vol.\r\nVIII of the eighth “Britannica,” where it is said that a mixture of\r\none part tin and two parts mercury is very effective, as is also the\r\namalgam consisting of mosaic gold and the deutosulphuret of tin. (Other\r\ndescriptions of the application of mosaic gold on the rubber are to\r\nbe found at p. 432, Vol. II of “Young’s Course of Lectures”; Woulfe,\r\n_Phil.

Sir David Brewster says that in order to obtain a\r\ncontinuous line of electrical light Fraunhofer brought to within half\r\nan inch of each other two conductors, and united them by a very fine\r\nglass thread. One of the conductors was connected with an electrical\r\nmachine and the other communicated with the ground. In this manner\r\nthe light appeared to pass continuously along the fibre of glass,\r\nwhich consequently formed a fine and brilliant line of light. When\r\nthis luminous line was expanded by refraction, Fraunhofer saw that,\r\nin relation to the lines of its spectrum, electric light was very\r\ndifferent both from the light of the sun and from that of a lamp. In\r\nthis spectrum he met with several lines partly very clear, and one of\r\nwhich, in the green space, seemed very brilliant compared with other\r\nparts of the spectrum (_Edin. Jour. of Sci._, No. XV. p. 7). He\r\nsaw in the orange another line not quite so bright, which appeared to\r\nbe of the same colour as that in lamplight spectra; but in measuring\r\nits angle of refraction he found that its light was much more strongly\r\nrefracted, and nearly as much as the yellow rays of lamplight. In the\r\nred rays toward the extremity of the spectrum, he observed a line\r\nof very little brightness, and yet its light had the same degree of\r\nrefrangibility as the clear line of lamplight, while in the rest of\r\nthe spectrum he saw the other four lines sufficiently bright. In a\r\nsubsequent paper read at Munich in 1823 (“Neue Modifikation des Lichtes\r\n...” or “New Modification of Light”) and in Schumacher’s “Astronomische\r\nAbhandlungen,” Fraunhofer states that, by means of the large electrical\r\nmachine in the cabinet of the Academy of Munich, he obtained a spectrum\r\nof electric light in which he recognized a great number of light lines,\r\nand that he had determined the relative place of the lightest lines as\r\nwell as the ratios of their intensities.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the electric spark for the purpose of volatilizing\r\nmetals was an important step in the development of spectral analysis,\r\nbut although used by both Wollaston and Fraunhofer its true value in\r\nthat particular line was not realized for many years after their time.\r\n\r\nFraunhofer is not only celebrated as one of the founders of spectrum\r\nanalysis, but he is well known also as the inventor of many important\r\nphilosophical instruments, being the constructor of the great Dorpat\r\nparallactic telescope, called by Struve _the giant refractor_. It\r\nwas during the year 1814 that he measured and described the innumerable\r\ndark lines of the solar spectrum known as Fraunhofer’s lines, which\r\nwere first noticed by Wollaston and reported upon by the latter to the\r\nRoyal Society in 1802.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--M.

I do not know how far\r\nexperiment has determined galvanic action to be communicated by means\r\nof wires; but there is no reason to suppose it confined as to limits,\r\ncertainly not as to time. Now, by means of apparatus fixed at certain\r\ndistances, as telegraphic stations, by tubes for the decomposition\r\nof water, metallic salts, etc., regularly arranged, such a key might\r\nbe adopted as would be requisite to communicate words, sentences or\r\nfigures, from one station to another, and so on to the end of the\r\nline.... As it takes up little room, and may be fixed in private, it\r\nmight in many cases of besieged towns, etc., convey useful intelligence\r\nwith scarcely a chance of detection by the enemy. However fanciful in\r\nspeculation, I have no doubt that, sooner or later, it will be rendered\r\nin useful practice. I have thus, my dear sir, ventured to encroach\r\non your time with some crude ideas that may serve perhaps to elicit\r\nsome useful experiments in the hands of others. When we consider what\r\nwonderful results have arisen from the first trifling experiments\r\nof the junction of a small piece of silver and zinc in so short a\r\nperiod, what may not be expected from the further extension of galvanic\r\nelectricity? I have no doubt of its being the chief agent in the hands\r\nof nature in the mighty changes that occur around us. If metals are\r\ncompound bodies, which I doubt not, will not this active principle\r\ncombine their constituents in numerous places so as to explain their\r\nmetallic formation; and if such constituents are in themselves\r\naeriform, may not galvanism reasonably tend to explain the existence of\r\nmetals in situations in which their specific gravities certainly do not\r\nentitle us to look for them?”\r\n\r\nCoxe does not appear, however, to have at any time made satisfactory\r\nexperiments, and his systems were considered impracticable until worked\r\nout by Alex. Bain during the year 1840.\r\n\r\nAt pp. 99–110, Vol. II of Dr. Coxe’s _Emporium of Arts and Sciences_,\r\nPhiladelphia, 1812, will be found his illustrated “Description of a\r\nRevolving Telegraph,” for conveying intelligence by figures, letters,\r\nwords or sentences, upon which plan, he says, he constructed a small\r\ntelegraph that worked “readily and appropriately, although by no means\r\nfitted with the various pulleys, etc., to facilitate the motion of the\r\nropes.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--For full explanation of Coxe’s systems, see L.\r\n   Turnbull, “Elect.

Mr. Todd found the\r\ncolumns of their electrical organs to be larger and less numerous in\r\nproportion than those described by Hunter, and that they appeared to\r\nbe of a cylindrical form, while from a number of experiments he drew,\r\namong other conclusions, the fact that a more intimate relation exists\r\nbetween the nervous system and electrical organs of the _torpedo_,\r\nboth as to structure and functions, than between the same and\r\nwhatsoever organs of any known animal.

The day telegraph\r\nconsisted of a framework, having two circular openings, in each of\r\nwhich was a semicircular screen or shutter which, revolving upon\r\nan axis in the centre of the circle, was capable of assuming four\r\ndifferent positions. This contrivance expressed an alphabet of sixteen\r\nletters, by dividing the latter into four classes of four each, and\r\nmaking one screen or shutter express the class, while the other\r\nindicated the number of the letter in that class.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1816.=--Sir Home Riggs Popham (1762–1820) British naval\r\nofficer, who had been a rear-admiral in 1814, introduces his land\r\nsemaphore which shows a great improvement upon all previous ones and\r\nat once replaces the Murray apparatus heretofore used by the English\r\nAdmiralty (see A.D. 1795). It consists only of two arms placed\r\nupon the same hollow hexagonal mast, and movable upon separate pivots,\r\neach of which can be made to assume six different positions, giving\r\ntogether forty-eight different signals. It is fully described and\r\nillustrated at pp. 30, 167–177, Vol. XXXIV of the _Trans. of the Soc.\r\nof Arts_, and also appears in the “Telegraph” article, Vol. II of\r\nthe “Encycl. of Useful Arts,” as well as at p. 149, Vol. XXIV of the\r\n“Penny Encycl.,” at pp. 67, 68, Vol. VIII of the (“Arts and Sciences”)\r\n“English Encycl.,” and in the “Telegraph” article by Sir John Barrow,\r\none of the secretaries to the Admiralty, in the seventh “Britannica.”\r\n\r\nIn this same year (1816), Sir Home Popham also introduced a ship\r\nsemaphore, which latter, as well as other similar devices of his\r\nconstruction, is to be found in the several publications already\r\nmentioned (the “Navy” article of the “Britannica” and pp. xii, xiii of\r\nRonalds’ “Catalogue”).\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1816.=--Ronalds (Francis), English experimentalist\r\n(1788–1873)--F.R.S., 1844, knighted 1870--whose serious attention\r\nto the development of electrical science appears to date from his\r\nmeeting with M. De Luc in 1814, constructs at Hammersmith his telegraph\r\nwhich is the type of all dial instruments and which first presents\r\nthe employment of two synchronous movements at the two stations. The\r\ntelegraph is fully described and illustrated in the “Description of an\r\nElectrical Telegraph and of Some Other Electrical Apparatus,” 8vo, 83\r\npages, which Mr. Ronalds issued in pamphlet form, London, 1823, and\r\nwhich is said to be the first work published on electric telegraphy.\r\nCopious extracts from this are to be found at pp. viii-xi of the\r\nRonalds “Catalogue,” and at pp. 129, 135–145, of Fahie’s “History,” the\r\nlatter also containing several fine plates reproduced from the original\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nFor his experimental line, Ronalds “erected two strong frames of wood\r\nat a distance of 20 yards from each other, and each containing 19\r\nhorizontal bars; to each bar he attached 37 hooks, and to the hooks\r\nwere applied as many silken cords, which supported a small iron wire\r\n(by these means well insulated), which (making its inflections at the\r\npoints of support) composed in one continuous length a distance of\r\nrather more than eight miles.” After making many experiments with this\r\noverhead line, he thus laid one underground:\r\n\r\n“A trench was dug in the garden 525 feet in length, and four feet deep.\r\nIn this was laid a trough of wood two inches square, well lined on the\r\ninside and out with pitch, and within this trough thick glass tubes\r\nwere placed, through which the wire ran.”\r\n\r\nHis biographer, Mr. Frost, adds:\r\n\r\n“In order to prevent the tubes from breaking by the variation of\r\ntemperature, each length was laid a short distance from the next\r\nlength, and the joint made with soft wax. The trough was then covered\r\nwith pieces of wood, screwed upon it whilst the pitch was hot. They\r\nwere also well covered with pitch, and the earth then thrown into the\r\ntrench again.”\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Highton, at p. 40 of his work, the “Electric Telegraph,”\r\n1852, says:\r\n\r\n“Ronalds employed an ordinary electric machine and the pith-ball\r\nelectrometer in the following manner. He placed two clocks at two\r\nstations; these two clocks had upon the second hand arbor a dial with\r\ntwenty letters on it; a screen was placed in front of each of these\r\ndials, and an orifice was cut in each screen, so that only one letter\r\nat a time could be seen on the revolving dial. The clocks were made to\r\ngo isochronously; and as the dials moved round the same letter always\r\nappeared through the orifices of each of these screens. The pith-ball\r\nelectrometers were hung in front of the dials. The attention of the\r\nobserver was called through the agency of an inflammable air gun fired\r\nby an electric spark.”\r\n\r\nRealizing the value of his invention, Ronalds strove to bring it before\r\nthe English Government, but was met (Aug. 5, 1816), with much the same\r\nencouragement we have seen vouchsafed Sharpe (A.D. 1813), and Wedgwood\r\n(A.D. 1814), viz. “Telegraphs of any kind are now wholly unnecessary\r\nand no other than the one now in use will be adopted.” The one alluded\r\nto was the semaphore line between London and Portsmouth, originally\r\nof the Chappe pattern and improved upon by Charles W. Pasley and Rear\r\nAdmiral Popham.\r\n\r\nAlluding to Mr. (afterward Sir) John Barrow’s letter in a note at p. 24\r\nof his work Ronalds says:\r\n\r\n“... Should they again become necessary, however, perhaps electricity\r\nand electricians may be indulged by his Lordship and Mr. Barrow with an\r\nopportunity of proving what they are capable of in this way.”\r\n\r\nHe was so disappointed that he not long after announced his “taking\r\nleave of a science which once afforded him a favourite source of\r\namusement,” and that he was “compelled to bid a cordial adieu to\r\nelectricity.” Fortunately for the scientific world, however, he\r\nafterward gave his attention again to electrical matters as is\r\nevidenced by many important papers contained in the publications noted\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nIn Ronalds’ afore-named work the phenomenon of retardation of signals\r\nin buried wires is clearly foreseen and described, although Zetzsche\r\nendeavours to combat this assertion at p. 38 of his “Geschichte der\r\nElektrischen Telegraphie,” Berlin, 1867. Speaking of the apprehended\r\ndifficulty of keeping the wire charged with electricity, Ronalds\r\nsuggests that when not at work “the machine be still kept in gentle\r\nmotion to supply the loss of electricity by default of insulation;\r\nwhich default, perhaps, could not be avoided, because (be the\r\natmosphere ever so dry, and the glass insulators ever so perfect),\r\nconductors are, I believe, robbed of their electricity by the same\r\nthree processes by which Sir Humphry Davy and Mr. Leslie say that\r\nbodies are robbed of their sensible heat, viz. by radiation, by\r\nconduction, and by the motion of the particles of air.” He also gives\r\ndescriptions of an improved electrical machine (eighth “Britannica,”\r\nVol. VIII. p. 536; _Sci. Am. Supp._, No. 647, p. 10326; Noad’s\r\n“Manual,” p. 69), of a new method of electrical insulation and of some\r\nexperiments on Vesuvius (_Quarterly Jour. of Sci._, Vols. II.\r\np. 249; XIV. pp. 332–334), of a new electrograph for registering the\r\ncharge of atmospheric electricity, of a pendulum doubler (_Edin.\r\nPhil. Jour._, Vol. IX, 1823, pp. 323–325) and of an attempt to apply\r\nM. De Luc’s electric column to the measurement of time. His other\r\ncontributions relative to the dry pile are to be found in the _Phil.\r\nMag._, Vols. XLIII. p. 414, and XLV. p. 466.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Biog.

It has since been found that the same result\r\noccurs in a minor degree when saline solutions are electrolyzed,\r\nand, generally, the greater the resistance which the liquid offers\r\nto electrolysis the greater is the amount which is thus mechanically\r\ncarried over.... It appears from the researches of Wiedemann (Pogg.,\r\n_Ann._, Vol. LXXXVII. p. 321), which have been confirmed by those of\r\nQuincke, that the amount of liquid transferred, _cæteris paribus_,\r\nis proportioned to the strength or intensity of the current; that it\r\nis independent of the thickness of the diaphragm by which the two\r\nportions of liquid are separated; and that when different solutions\r\nare employed, the amount transferred in each case, by currents of\r\nequal intensity, is directly proportional to the specific resistance\r\nof the liquid. Miller, from whom the above is taken, says that this\r\ntransfer has been minutely studied by Quincke, and gives an account of\r\nthe latter’s work extracted from the _Ann. de Chimie_, LXIII. p. 479.\r\nBrewster’s allusion to Porret and Wiedemann (eighth “Britannica,” Vol.\r\nVIII. p. 630) is followed by the statement that Mr. Graham considers\r\nordinary endosmose as produced by the electricity of chemical action.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Graham, Vol. II. p. 266; De la Rive’s\r\n   “Electricity,” Chap.

Connolly makes known through an English\r\nand French pamphlet, entitled “An Essay on Universal Telegraphic\r\nCommunication,” the details of his portable telegraph.\r\n\r\nAs shown in the thirty-sixth volume of the _Transactions of the\r\nSociety of Arts_ and in the twenty-fourth volume of the “Penny\r\nCyclopædia,” his apparatus consists merely of three square boards\r\npainted with simple devices, like triangles, crescents, etc., the\r\ncolours on the one side being the reverse of those on the other. Each\r\nof the six figures thus obtained is capable of producing four different\r\ndistinct signals, making in all twenty-four, by successively turning\r\neach side of the board downward. In experiments made at Chatham, boards\r\nonly eighteen inches square were found to answer for a distance of two\r\nmiles, with a telescope having a magnifying power of twenty-five; and\r\nMr. Connolly had also, it is said, exhibited these signals between\r\nGros-nez and Sarque, a distance of seventeen miles, with boards twelve\r\nfeet square.\r\n\r\nAt pp. 205, 208, of the _Transactions of the Society of Arts_,\r\n1818, Vol. XXXV, and at p. 98, Vol. XXXVI for 1819, will be found\r\nMr. Connolly’s system of telegraphing by means of flags in manner\r\ndifferent from that of Lieut.-Col. John Macdonald alluded to at Pasley,\r\nA.D. 1808.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1817.=--In the “Encycl. Brit.” article treating of the influence\r\nof magnetism on chemical action, it is said that M. Muschman, Professor\r\nof Chemistry in the University of Christiania, made experiments to\r\nascertain the effect of the earth’s magnetism on the precipitation of\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nDesirous of explaining the chemical theory of the tree of Diana\r\n(_Arbor Dianæ_, first observed by Leméry), “he took a tube like a\r\nsiphon and poured mercury into it, which accordingly occupied the lower\r\npart of the two branches; above the mercury he poured a strong solution\r\nof nitrate of silver. He then placed the two branches of the siphon\r\nso that the plane passing through them was in the magnetic meridian,\r\nand after standing a few seconds the silver began to precipitate\r\nitself with its natural lustre; but it accumulated particularly in the\r\nnorthern branch of the siphon, while that which was less copiously\r\nprecipitated in the other branch had a less brilliant lustre, and was\r\nmixed with the mercurial salt deposited from the solution.” Muschman\r\nand Prof. Hansteen, having repeated this experiment with the same\r\nresult, concluded that the magnetism of the earth had an influence\r\non the precipitation of silver from a solution of its nitrate, and\r\nMuschman inferred from the experiment the identity of galvanism and\r\nmagnetism (eighth “Britannica,” Vol. XIV. p. 42).\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1817.=--Freycinet (Claude Louis Desaulses de) (1779–1842),\r\ncaptain in the French navy, is sent in command of an expedition fitted\r\nout by the French Government for the purpose of making scientific\r\nobservations in a voyage round the world. The experimental stations\r\nwere the Island of Rawak (near the coast of Guinea), Guam (one of the\r\nLadrones), the Isle of France, Mowi (one of the Sandwich Islands),\r\nRio Janeiro, Port Jackson, Cape of Good Hope, Paris and the Falkland\r\nIslands, as described in his “Voyage Autour du Monde ...” Paris, 1842.\r\n\r\nHis observations on the diurnal variations of the needle, which confirm\r\nthe investigations made by Lieut.-Col. John Macdonald (A.D.\r\n1808), are to be found at p. 54, Vol. XIV of the eighth “Britannica.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--His “Voyage de Découvertes ... 1800–1804 ...” (F.\r\n   Péron and Louis Freycinet), also his “Navigation et Géog. ...”\r\n   1815; the note at p. 158, Vol. I of Humboldt’s “Cosmos,” London,\r\n   1849; _Phil.

This is said to\r\nconsist of several “bar magnets smeared over with oil placed in a frame\r\nbehind the grindstone.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1818.=--Bostock (John) (1774–1846), English physician, F.R.S.,\r\nlecturer at Guy’s Hospital, publishes in London his “Account of the\r\nHistory and Present State of Galvanism,” which is scarcely more than a\r\ncompilation of works treating of that branch of science.\r\n\r\nOne of the passages is, however, worth quoting, for it reflects the\r\nopinion shared by many physicists of the time that the resources of\r\nthe galvanic field were already wellnigh exhausted. It thus appears\r\nat p. 102: “Although it may be somewhat hazardous to form predictions\r\nrespecting the progress of science, I may remark that the impulse which\r\nwas given in the first instance by Galvani’s original experiments,\r\nwas revived by Volta’s discovery of the pile, and was carried to\r\nthe highest pitch by Sir H. Davy’s application of it to chemical\r\ndecomposition, seems to have, in a great measure, subsided. It may be\r\nconjectured that we have carried the power of the instrument to the\r\nutmost extent of which it admits; and it does not appear that we are at\r\npresent in the way of making any important additions to our knowledge\r\nof its effects, or of obtaining any new light upon the theory of its\r\naction.”\r\n\r\nBostock is also the author of “Outline of the History of the Galvanic\r\nApparatus”; “On the Theory of Galvanism” (_Nicholson’s Journal_ for\r\n1802); “On the Hypothesis of Galvanism” (_Annals of Philosophy_, III,\r\n1814), and of other works upon different scientific subjects. Reference\r\nis made by Mr. William Leithead (“Electricity,” London, 1837, Chap. VI.\r\npp. 296, 297) to Bostock’s “Elementary System of Physiology,” 1827,\r\nVol. II. pp. 413, etc., wherein is shown among other results, that,\r\ncontrary to the views of Dr. Philip, there is no necessary connection\r\nbetween “the nervous influence” and the action of the glands. At p. 306\r\nof Leithead appears another extract, from the third volume of Bostock,\r\nrelative to the application of the electro-physiological theory in\r\nelucidating the phenomena of disease.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Poggendorff, Vol. I. pp. 249, 250; “Nicholson’s\r\n   Journal,” Vols.

This work, which is\r\nsaid to have been practically completed in 1813 (Humboldt, “Cosmos,”\r\n1859, Vol. V. p. 66), was translated by the celebrated Peter Andreas\r\nHansen (Poggendorff, Vol. I. pp. 1013–1015) from the original\r\nmanuscript and published in German. It attracted much attention\r\nthroughout the scientific world, and so highly was it thought of that\r\nin almost all the voyages of discovery afterwards undertaken most\r\nmagnetic observations were made according to its directions.\r\n\r\nThrough the “Encyclopædia Britannica” we learn that Hansteen’s able\r\nwork was first made known in England by Sir David Brewster through\r\ntwo articles in the _Edin. Phil. Journal_ for 1820, Vol. III. p.\r\n138, and Vol. IV. p. 114, and that an account of his subsequent\r\nresearches, drawn up by Hansteen himself, appeared in the _Edin.\r\nJournal of Science_ for 1826, Vol. V. p. 65. It is also stated that\r\nthe Royal Society of Denmark proposed in 1811 the prize question,\r\n“Is the supposition of one magnetical axis sufficient to account for\r\nthe magnetical phenomena of the earth, or are two necessary?” Prof.\r\nHansteen’s attention had been previously drawn to this subject by\r\nseeing a terrestrial globe, on which was drawn an elliptical line\r\nround the south pole and marked _Regio polaris magnetica_, one of the\r\nfoci being called _Regio fortior_, and the other _Regio debilior_. As\r\nthis figure professed to be drawn by Wilcke, from the observations of\r\nCooke and Furneaux, Hansteen was led to compare it with the facts; and\r\nthe result of his researches was favourable to that part of Halley’s\r\ntheory which assumes the existence of four poles and two magnetic axes.\r\nHansteen’s Memoir, which was crowned by the Danish Society, forms\r\nthe groundwork of his larger volume published in 1819. “In his fifth\r\nchapter, on the Mathematical Theory of the Magnet, he deduces the law\r\nof magnetic action from a series of experiments similar to those of\r\nHauksbee and Lambert.... In determining the intensity of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism Professor Hansteen observed that the time of vibration of\r\na horizontal needle varied during the day. Graham had previously\r\nsuspected a change of this kind, but his methods were not accurate\r\nenough to prove it. Hansteen found that the minimum intensity took\r\nplace between ten and eleven a.m., and the maximum between four and\r\nfive p.m. He concluded also that there was an annual variation, the\r\nintensity being considerably greater in winter near the perihelion, and\r\nin summer near the aphelion; that the greatest monthly variation was a\r\nmaximum when the earth is in its perihelion or aphelion, and a minimum\r\nnear the equinoxes; and that the greatest daily variation is least in\r\nwinter and greatest in summer. He found also that the aurora borealis\r\nweakened the magnetic force, and that the magnetic intensity is always\r\nweakest when the moon crosses the equator.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Whewell (“History of Induc. Sciences,” 1859, Vol. II.\r\np. 226), the conclusions reached by Hansteen respecting the position\r\nof the four magnetic “poles” excited so much interest in his own\r\ncountry that the Norwegian Storthing, or Parliament, by a unanimous\r\nvote provided funds for a magnetic expedition which he was to conduct\r\nalong the north of Europe and Asia, and this they did at the very time\r\nwhen, strange to say, they refused to make a grant to the King for\r\nbuilding a palace at Christiania. The expedition was made in 1828–1830,\r\nand verified Hansteen’s anticipations as to the existence of a region\r\nof magnetic convergence in Siberia, which he considered as indicating\r\na “pole” to the north of that country. The results were published in\r\nHansteen and Due’s “Resultate magnetischer ...” (“Magn., Astron. and\r\nMéteor. Obs. on Journey through Siberia”) which appeared in 1863.\r\n\r\nIn the Sixth Dissertation, Chap. VII of the “Encycl. Brit.,” it is\r\nsaid that, next to Prof. Hansteen, science is mainly indebted for\r\nthe great extension of our knowledge of the facts and the laws of\r\nterrestrial magnetism to two illustrious German philosophers, Baron\r\nAlexander von Humboldt and Prof. Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855). An\r\naccount is therein given of Gauss’s individual investigations, as well\r\nas of the researches he made in conjunction with Wilhelm Eduard Weber\r\n(1804–1891), who was likewise a professor at Göttingen. Of Alex. von\r\nHumboldt, we have spoken fully under date 1799, and of Gauss and Weber,\r\nmention has already been made at Schilling (A.D. 1812).\r\n\r\nThe very valuable contributions of Gauss and Weber appear throughout\r\nall the many scientific publications of the period, notably in the\r\n“Abhandlung d. Gött. Geselsch. d. Wiss.,” their joint work being shown\r\nto advantage in the important “Resultate ... des Magnet. Vereins,”\r\npublished in Leipzig, 1837–1843.[58]\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--For M.

(A full\r\nreview of this work is to be found more particularly at p. 206, Vol.\r\nLIV of the _Philosophical Magazine_; in the “Encycl. Metropol.,”\r\nVol. IV (Galvanism), p. 222; in Ure’s “Dictionary of Chemistry,” Am.\r\ned., article “Calorimotor”; at p. 187 of the _Phil.

Jour. of Sci._, the last named\r\nbeing accompanied by a very fine illustration of the Calorimotor.)\r\n\r\nThis apparatus, which has already been alluded to (Pepys, A.D. 1802),\r\nconsists of sheets of zinc about 9 inches by 6, and of copper about 14\r\ninches by 6, coiled around one another nearly half an inch apart; there\r\nbeing in all 80 coils, 2½ inches in diameter, which are let down by\r\nmeans of a lever into glass vessels containing the acid solution. Dr.\r\nHare observes:\r\n\r\n“Volta considered all galvanic apparatus as consisting of one or more\r\nelectromotors, or movers of the electric fluid. To me it appeared\r\nthat they were movers of both heat and electricity; the ratio of the\r\nquantity of the latter put in motion to the quantity of the former put\r\nin motion being as the number of the series to the superficies. Hence\r\nthe word _electromotor_ can only be applicable when the caloric\r\nbecomes evanescent, and electricity almost the sole product, as in De\r\nLuc’s and Zamboni’s columns; and the word _calorimotor_ ought to\r\nbe used when electricity becomes evanescent and caloric appears the\r\nsole product.”\r\n\r\n“It afterwards appeared quite natural,” remarks Mr. W. B. Taylor (Note\r\nB, “Mem. of Jos. Henry,” p. 376) “to distinguish these classes of\r\neffects by the old terms--‘intensity’ for electromotive force, and\r\n‘quantity’ for calorimotive force. There is obviously a close analogy\r\nbetween these differences of condition and resultant, and the more\r\nstrongly contrasted conditions of mechanical and chemical electricity;\r\nand indeed the whole may be said to lie in a continuous series,\r\nfrom the highest ‘intensity’ with minimum quantity, to the greatest\r\n‘quantity’ with minimum intensity.”\r\n\r\nTwo years later (1821), Dr. Hare constructed his _galvanic\r\ndeflagrator_. It consists of two pairs of troughs, each ten feet\r\nlong, and containing 150 galvanic pairs, so arranged that the plates\r\ncan all be simultaneously immersed into or withdrawn from the acid.\r\nEach pair turns on pivots made of iron, coated with brass or copper,\r\nand a communication is established between these and the voltaic series\r\nwithin by means of small strips of copper. The “Encycl. Brit.” gives\r\na full description of the construction and working of the apparatus,\r\nas do also the “Encycl. Metropol.,” Vol. IV (Galv.), p. 176; Noad\r\n(“Manual,” pp. 266, 267); Gmelin (“Chemistry,” Vol. I. pp. 409, 410),\r\nand Silliman (“Journal of Sci. and Arts,” Vol. VII. p. 347). The\r\nfirst-named publication says of Dr. Hare’s _deflagrator_:\r\n\r\n“A brilliant light, equal to that of the sun, was produced between\r\ncharcoal points, and plumbago and charcoal were fused by Profs.\r\nSilliman and Griscom. By a series of 250, baryta was deflagrated, and\r\na platina wire, three-sixteenths of an inch in thickness, ‘was made to\r\nflow like water.’ In the experiments with charcoal, the charcoal on the\r\ncopper side had no appearance of fusion, but a crater-shaped cavity was\r\nformed within it, indicating that the charcoal was volatilized at this\r\nside and transferred to the other, where it was condensed and fused,\r\nthe piece of charcoal at this pile being elongated considerably. This\r\nfused charcoal was four times denser than before fusion. In a letter\r\nfrom Prof. Silliman, which was transcribed in the _Sc. Am. Sup._\r\nfor Sept. 21, 1878, he says: ‘Undoubtedly the earliest exhibitions\r\nof electric light from the voltaic battery were those made with the\r\ndeflagrators of Dr. Hare by Prof. Silliman at New Haven in 1822, and\r\nsubsequently on a magnificent scale at Boston in 1834, when an arc of\r\nover five inches diameter was produced by the simultaneous immersion\r\nof 900 large-sized couples of Hare’s deflagrator. But no means had\r\nthen been devised for the regulation of the electric light to render\r\nit constant, and although the writer as early as 1842 used this light\r\nsuccessfully to produce daguerreotypes, the progress of invention had\r\nyet to make further use of the discovery of science before electrical\r\nillumination was possible.’”\r\n\r\nThe description of Dr. Hare’s electrical machine (before alluded\r\nto at Van Marum A.D. 1785), wherein the plate is mounted\r\nhorizontally so as to show both negative and positive electricity,\r\nwas published in London during 1823, and can be found in Vol. LXII of\r\nthe _Phil. Mag._, as well as at pp. 538, 604, 605, Vol. VIII of\r\nthe 1855 “Encycl. Brit.” In the last-named article mention is made of\r\nthe introduction of a band (illustrated Fig. 7, Plate CCXXII) which\r\nprevents the plate from being cracked, as it frequently is, through\r\nsome hasty effort to put it in motion while it adheres to the cushions.\r\nIt is also therein stated that in order to offset the heavy expense\r\nattending the breakage of large cylinders and plates, M. Walkiers\r\nde St. Amand, of Brussels, among many others, made an apparatus\r\nof varnished silk 25 feet long and 5 feet wide, capable of giving\r\nsparks 15 inches long (see A.D. 1785), while Dr. Ingen-housz\r\nconstructed machines with pasteboard discs four feet in diameter,\r\nsoaked in copal or amber varnish dissolved in linseed oil, which gave\r\nsparks of one and even two feet in length.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth volume, new series, of the _Amer. Phil. Trans._\r\nwill be found Dr. Hare’s “Description of an Electrical Machine,” with\r\na plate four feet in diameter, so constructed as to be above the\r\noperator; also of a battery discharger employed therewith, and some\r\nobservations on the causes of the diversity in the length of the sparks\r\nerroneously distinguished by the terms positive and negative. Hare is\r\nalso the inventor of a single gold-leaf electroscope of such great\r\ndelicacy that it has, he says, enabled him to detect the electricity\r\nproduced by one contact between a zinc and copper disc, each six\r\ninches in diameter (Noad, “Manual,” p. 29; Harris’ “Rudim. Elect.,”\r\np. 50; Silliman’s _Journal_, Vol. XXXV). He invented several\r\nother electrical appliances, and he is likewise the author of numerous\r\nimportant memoirs which it would be impossible to detail in the narrow\r\nlimits of this “Bibliographical History.” They will, however, be found\r\nrecorded in the publications named below.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Phil.

Chemie,” which embodies\r\nthe whole extent of chemical science as it then existed and the fourth\r\nand last edition of which, under the author’s supervision, appeared\r\nduring 1843–1845. This extensive work is well known, both in its\r\noriginal form and through the very able translation of it made by Mr.\r\nHenry Watts. In the report of the Council of the Chemical Society for\r\n1854, it is said that “the greatest service which Gmelin rendered to\r\nscience--a service in which he surpassed all his predecessors and all\r\nhis contemporaries--consists in this: that he collected and arranged\r\nin order all the facts that have been discovered in connection with\r\nchemistry. His Handbuch der theoret Chemie stands alone. Other writers\r\non chemistry have indeed arranged large quantities of materials in\r\nsystematic order, but for completeness and fidelity of collation and\r\nconsecutiveness of arrangement, Gmelin’s Handbuch is unrivalled.”\r\n\r\nAlthough many references have been made herein to Leopold Gmelin’s\r\ntreatment of such departments of science as directly appeal to the\r\nreaders of this compilation, it is well to mention some of the\r\nheadings under which they are to be found. They are, “Electricity,”\r\n“Electro-chemical Theories,” “Electrolysis,” “Technical Apparatus of\r\nElectricity,” “Theory of Galvanism,” “Galvanic Batteries,” “Magnetic\r\nCondition of All Matter,” etc., etc., the whole occupying pp. 304 to\r\n519, Vol. I of Gmelin’s English edition. The list of many of Leopold\r\nGmelin’s valuable contributions to science is given in the “Catalogue\r\nSc. Papers Roy. Soc.,” besides which may be mentioned his “Uber e\r\nangebl. meteorische masse” (Gilbert, _Annalen_, LXXIII for 1823),\r\nand his “Versuch einer elektro-chemisch. theorie” (Poggendorff’s\r\n_Annalen der Physik und Chemie_, Vol. XLIV for 1838, while at pp.\r\n547–550 of Mr. J. J. Griffin’s able work, published in London during\r\n1858, will be found the results obtained by Prof. G. Magnus and by\r\nProf. Faraday with a summary of Gmelin’s conclusions under the heading\r\nof “The Evidence of Electrolysis in Favour of the Radical Theory.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             GMELIN FAMILY\r\n\r\nThis family, which, through four generations, has been continuously\r\ndistinguished for its valuable contributions to chemistry as well as to\r\nthe natural and medical sciences, deserves equally well here of such a\r\nspecial mention as was accorded to the Bernoulli and Cassini families,\r\nunder dates A.D. 1700 and 1782–1791.\r\n\r\nJohann Georg Gmelin (1674–1728), a very able chemist and pharmaceutist\r\nof Tübingen, was the father of:\r\n\r\n   Johann Conrad Gmelin (1707–1759), physician and author in the\r\n   same city of Tübingen.\r\n\r\n   Johann Georg Gmelin (1709–1755), distinguished naturalist and\r\n   chemist, who graduated as M.D. in his nineteenth year, became\r\n   a member of the St. Petersburg Acad. of Sc. and was sent by\r\n   the Empress Anna, in company with G. A. Müller and other noted\r\n   scientists, upon a ten years’ exploring expedition through\r\n   Siberia. He was one of the first explorers of Northern Asia, and\r\n   a genus of Asiatic plants was named Gmelina after him by Linnæus.\r\n\r\n   Philip Friedrich Gmelin (1722–1768), Professor of Botany and of\r\n   Chemistry at Tübingen, author of many scientific monographs.\r\n\r\nSamuel Gottlieb Gmelin (1744–1774), elder son of Philip Friedrich,\r\nwho, like his uncle, graduated M.D. at nineteen and was sent two\r\nyears later by the Empress Catherine II upon a scientific tour through\r\nSouth-Eastern Russia, is the author of “Historia Fucorum ...” as well\r\nas of other contributions which were edited through the famous Pallas.\r\nHis biographical notice appears in the last volume of the “Reise durch\r\nRussland ...” published at St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nJohann Friedrich Gmelin (1748–1804), M.D., succeeded his father,\r\nPhilip Friedrich, in the chair of chemistry and botany at the Tübingen\r\nUniversity, became Professor of Medicine at Göttingen in 1778 and a\r\nmember of “l’Académie des Curieux de la Nature.” He is the author\r\nof the thirteenth edition of Linnæus’ “Systema Naturæ,” which,\r\nnotwithstanding Cuvier’s severe criticism of it, is said to be the\r\nonly work which even professes to embrace all the objects of natural\r\nhistory described up to the year 1790 (“Encycl. Brit.,” 1855, Vol. IX.\r\np. 4). He is also the author of “Geschichte der Chemie ...” Göttingen,\r\n1797–1799, and of “Prælectio de col. metal. a Volta ...” (“Commentat.\r\nSoc. Gött.” XV (Phys.) for 1800–1803, p. 38). (See J. C. Poggendorff,\r\n“Biogr.-Literar. Handwörterbuch,” Vol. I. pp. 914–915.)\r\n\r\nHis son, Leopold Gmelin (1788–1853), who has already been noticed,\r\npractised chemical manipulation in the Tübingen pharmaceutical\r\nlaboratory of Dr. Christian Gmelin, the son of Johann Conrad, and\r\nstudied at Göttingen, Vienna and in Italy, after which he became\r\nmedical and chemical professor at Heidelberg, 1817–1851 (Poggendorff,\r\nVol. I. pp. 915–916).\r\n\r\nFerdinand Gottlob von Gmelin (1782–1848), elder son of Dr. Christian\r\nGmelin, was Professor of Medicine and of Natural History in the\r\nTübingen University, and wrote “Diss. sistens obs. phys. et chem. de\r\nelectricitate et galvanismo” during 1802 (Poggendorff, Vol. I. pp.\r\n916–917).\r\n\r\nChristian Gottlob Gmelin (1792–1860), brother of the last named, M.D.,\r\nwas Professor of Chemistry and Pharmacy at the Tübingen University, and\r\nthe author of “Experimenta electricitatem ...” 1820; “Uber d.

F.), M.D. (1793–1827), Chemical Assistant\r\nin Harvard University and Lecturer on Chemistry and Pharmacy in\r\nDartmouth College, writes, Jan. 25, 1819, to Prof. Benjamin Silliman\r\nconcerning his new form of portable electrical battery.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus, consisting of alternate plates of flat glass and of\r\ntinfoil, the sheets of which latter are connected together, is fully\r\ndescribed at pp. 292–294, and is illustrated opposite p. 288, Vol. I\r\nof Silliman’s _American Journal of Science_, 1818, wherein it is\r\nstated that, while “in a battery of the common form, 2 feet long, 1\r\nfoot wide and 10 inches high, containing 18 coated jars, there will be\r\nno more than 3500 square inches of coated surface,” a battery of Dana’s\r\nconstruction will have no less than 8000 square inches covered with\r\ntinfoil, allowing the sheet of glass and of foil to be a quarter of an\r\ninch thick. In a brief description of this apparatus, which appears\r\nat p. 468, Vol. V of Tilloch’s _Phil. Mag. and Journal_, it is\r\nstated that a “battery constructed in this way contains, in the bulk of\r\na quarto volume, a very powerful instrument; and when made of glass it\r\nis extremely easy, by varnishing the edges, to keep the whole of the\r\ninner surfaces from the air, and to retain it in a constant state of\r\ndry insulation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1820.=--Oersted--Örsted (Hans Christian), native of Denmark\r\n(1770–1851), Professor of Natural Philosophy and founder of the\r\nPolytechnic School in Copenhagen, makes known, through a small\r\nfour-page pamphlet entitled “Experimenta circa effectum conflictus\r\nelectrici in acum magneticam,” his great discovery of the intimate\r\nrelation existing between electricity and magnetism (Thomson’s _Annals\r\nof Philosophy_ for October 1820, Vol. XVI, first series, pp. 273–276).\r\nHe thus lays the foundation of the science of electro-magnetism, which\r\nsubsequently was so materially developed by Ampère and Faraday.\r\n\r\nIt is said that after taking his doctor’s degree in 1799, he gave much\r\nattention to galvanism, and that in the year 1800 he made important\r\ndiscoveries as to the action of acids during the production of galvanic\r\nelectricity. He was one of the earliest to show the opposite conditions\r\nof the poles of the galvanic battery, also that acids and alkalies are\r\nproduced in proportion as they neutralize each other. Upon his return\r\nfrom a trip to France and Germany, 1801–3, he lectured on electricity\r\nand the cognate sciences, publishing thereon a number of essays.

Voigt’s _Magazin_, Vol.\r\nIII. p. 412; Van Mons’ _Journal_, No. IV. p. 68; the _Bulletin of the\r\nSociété Philomathique_, No. LXVII. an. xi. p. 128; A. F. Gehlen’s\r\n_Neues Allgem. Journal d.

Forhandlinger,” 1814–1815; “Nyt Biblioth. f.\r\nPhysik,” etc., Vol. IX, and in the _Journal de Physique_ as well as in\r\nthe _Journal du Galvanisme_.)\r\n\r\nHe revisited Germany during 1812, and, at the suggestion of Karsten\r\nNiebuhr, published in Berlin his work “Ansicht der Chemischen\r\nNaturgesetze. ...” (“Inquiry into the identity of chemical and electric\r\nforces”), a translation of which was made by M. P. Marcel T. de Serres\r\nunder the title of “Recherches sur l’Identité. ...” (Fahie, “Hist. of\r\nElectric Teleg.,” 1884, pp. 270–273). The last-named work appeared\r\nat Paris during 1813, and not, as stated at p. 41, Vol. LVII of the\r\n_Philosophical Magazine_, during 1807, which was the date of the\r\noriginal small German edition.[59]\r\n\r\nOne of his biographers says that Oersted was lecturing one day to a\r\nclass of advanced students, when, as a means of testing the soundness\r\nof the theory which he had long been meditating, it occurred to him\r\nto place a magnetic needle under the influence of a wire uniting the\r\nends of a voltaic battery in a state of activity. “In galvanism,” said\r\nhe, “the force is more latent than in electricity, and, still more\r\nso in magnetism than in galvanism; it is necessary therefore to try\r\nwhether electricity, in its latent state, will not affect the magnetic\r\nneedle.” He tried the experiment upon the spot and found that the\r\nneedle tended to turn at right angles to the wire, thus proving the\r\nexistence of electro-magnetism, or the relation of electricity and\r\nmagnetism as mutually productive of each other, and as evidences of a\r\ncommon source of power. Previous to this time the identity of magnetism\r\nand electricity had only been suspected. For several months Oersted\r\nprosecuted experiments on the subject, and on the 21st of July 1820\r\npromulgated his discovery through the Latin pamphlet above alluded to.\r\nTherein he contends that there is always a magnetic circulation around\r\nthe electric conductor, and that the electric current in accordance\r\nwith a certain law always exercises determined and similar impressions\r\non the direction of the magnetic needle, even when it does not pass\r\nthrough the needle but near it (the eighth edition of the “Encycl.\r\nBritannica,” Fifth Dissertation, pp. 739, 740, 745; and the Sixth\r\nDissertation, pp. 973–976; Schaffner, “Tel. Manual,” 1859, Chap. VIII;\r\n_Practical Mechanic_, Glasgow, 1842, Vol. III. p. 45).\r\n\r\nFor this discovery, which naturally excited the wonder of the entire\r\nscientific world, he received the Copley medal of the English Royal\r\nSociety, the Dannebrog order of knighthood and numerous testimonials\r\nfrom nearly every quarter of Europe. As observed by Mr. J. D. Forbes\r\n(Sixth Disser. “Encycl. Brit.,” Vol. I), “the _desideratum_ of\r\na clear expression of the manifest alliance between electricity and\r\nmagnetism has been so long and so universally felt that the discovery\r\nplaced its author in the first rank of scientific men.... The prize of\r\nthe French Institute, which had been awarded to Davy for his galvanic\r\ndiscoveries, was bestowed upon Oersted.”\r\n\r\nOersted’s experiments were repeated before the French Academy of\r\nSciences by M. De la Rive on Sept. 11, 1820, and, seven days later, as\r\nwe shall see, Ampère made known the law governing electro-magnetism\r\n(Mme. Le Breton, “Hist. et. Appl. de l’Elect.,” Paris, 1884, pp.\r\n72, 73; W. Sturgeon, “Sci. Researches,” Bury, 1850, p. 18; Higg’s\r\nTranslation of Fontaine’s “Electric Lighting,” London, 1878, p. 54).\r\n\r\nThe many investigations subsequently carried on by Oersted in different\r\nbranches of sciences are alluded to in the works named below. Perhaps\r\nthe most interesting, outside of the ones already spoken of, are those\r\nattaching to thermo-electricity which he made in conjunction with Baron\r\nFourier, and independently of Dr. Seebeck.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Eighth “Britannica,” pp. 651 and 652, Vol. XXI, as\r\n   well as pp. 11 and 12, Vol. XIV of Oersted’s “Efterretning om\r\n   nogle nye, af Fourier og Oersted ...” Kiobenhaven, 1822–1823,\r\n   translated into French as mentioned in Vol. XXII of the _Annales\r\n   de Chimie et de Physique_; “Oversigt over det Kongl. ...” for\r\n   1822–1823 and 1823–1824; Poggendorff, Vol. III. pp. 309–312;\r\n   “Catal.

Boisgeraud, Jr., reads, before the French\r\nAcadémie des Sciences, a paper concerning many of his experiments,\r\nwhich prove to be merely variations of those previously made by Oersted.\r\n\r\nHe observed that connecting wires, or arcs, placed anywhere in the\r\nbattery, affect the needle, and he noticed the difference of intensity\r\nin the effects produced when electrical conductors are employed to\r\ncomplete the circuit. He proposed to ascertain the conducting power\r\nof different substances by placing them in one of the arcs, cells or\r\ndivisions of the battery, and bringing the magnetic needle, or Ampère’s\r\ngalvanometer, toward another arc, viz. to the wire or other connecting\r\nbody used to complete the circuit in the battery. With regard to\r\nthe positions of the needle and wire, as observed by Boisgeraud,\r\nthey are all confirmatory of Prof. Oersted’s statement (“Ency. Met.”\r\n(Electro.-Mag.), Vol. IV. p. 6).\r\n\r\nOne month later, Nov. 9, 1820, Boisgeraud reads, before the same\r\nAcadémie, his paper “On the Action of the Voltaic Pile upon the\r\nMagnetic Needle,” which will be found on pp. 203–206 and 257, 258, Vol.\r\nLVII of the _Philosophical Magazine_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1820.=--Banks (Sir Joseph) (1743–1820), a very eminent\r\nEnglish naturalist and traveller, to whom reference has been made\r\nunder the A.D. 1775 date, deserves mention here were it alone\r\nfor the fact that while occupying the presidential chair of the Roy.\r\nSoc., during the extraordinary long and unequalled period of over\r\n_forty-two years_ (1777, date of Sir John Pringle’s retirement,\r\nto 1820, the date of President Banks’ death) he was instrumental in\r\nbringing prominently before the world many of the most important\r\ndiscoveries and experiments known in the annals of magnetism and\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Banks was succeeded in the presidency of the Royal Society\r\nby William Hyde Wollaston, M.D., June 29, 1820, and by Sir Humphry\r\nDavy, Bart., Nov. 30, 1820, the last named holding the office seven\r\nyears (R. Weld, “Hist. Roy. Soc.,” 1848, Vol. II. p. 359). Banks and\r\nDr. Solander, the pupil of Linnæus, had sailed (1768–1771) with Captain\r\nCook in his voyage around the globe, in the capacity of naturalists,\r\nand afterwards (1772) visited Iceland, where they made many important\r\ndiscoveries. In 1781 Banks was created a baronet; he received the Order\r\nof the Bath in 1795 and subsequently had many honours conferred upon\r\nhim by different English and foreign societies. It is said that he was\r\nnever known to be appealed to in vain by men of science, either for\r\npecuniary assistance or for the use of his extensive library.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Tilloch’s _Phil.

(1776–1827), who taught\r\nmathematics at the Military Academy of Woolwich from 1806 to 1847,\r\nbrings out the first edition of his “Essay on Magnetic Attractions,\r\nParticularly as Respects the Deviation of the Compass on Shipboard\r\nOccasioned by the Local Influence of the Guns, etc., with an Easy\r\nPractical Method of Observing the Same in all Parts of the World.”\r\nOne of his biographers states that through this valuable publication,\r\nwhich received the Parliamentary reward from the then existing Board\r\nof Longitude, as well as presents from the Russian Emperor, he was\r\nthe first to reduce to strictly mathematical principles the method of\r\ncompensating compass errors in vessels (_Edin. Jour. of Sci._,\r\nLondon, 1826, Vols. I. pp. 181, 182; II. p. 379).\r\n\r\nThis work contains the results of the many experiments to ascertain\r\nthe influence of spherical and other masses of iron upon the needle,\r\nwhich Barlow instituted, more particularly after Prof. Hansteen’s\r\ninvestigations became generally known. Sir David Brewster details\r\nBarlow’s work in the “Encycl. Brit.,” and refers to the separate\r\nobservations of Mr. Wm. Wales (at A.D. 1774), Mr. Downie (at A.D.\r\n1790), Captain Flinders (at A.D. 1801), and Charles Bonnycastle (at\r\nA.D. 1820), mentioning the fact that it is to Mr. W. Bain we owe the\r\ndistinct establishment and explanation of the source of error in the\r\ncompass arising from the attraction of all the iron on board of ships.\r\nThe small 140-page book which Mr. Bain published on the subject in 1817\r\nis entitled “An Essay on the Variation of the Compass, Showing how Far\r\nit is Influenced by a Change in the Direction of the Ship’s Head, with\r\nan Exposition of the Dangers Arising to Navigators from not Allowing\r\nfor this Change of Variation.” Brewster remarks that additional light\r\nwas thrown upon Mr. Bain’s observations by Captains Ross, Parry and\r\nSabine, but that we owe to Prof. Barlow alone a series of brilliant\r\nexperiments which terminated in his invention of the neutralizing\r\nplate for correcting in perfect manner this source of error in the\r\ncompass (Noad’s “Manual,” pp. 531, 532; Olmstead’s “Introduct. to Nat.\r\nHist.,” 1835, pp. 206, 210). The simple contrivance therein alluded to\r\nis described and illustrated at pp. 9 and 90–91 of the “Britannica,”\r\narticle on “Navigation,” and may briefly be said to consist of only a\r\nthin circular plate of iron placed in a vertical position immediately\r\nbehind the binnacle or compass (Fifth Dissertation of “Britannica,”\r\nVol. I. p. 745, and article “Seamanship,” in Vol. XX. p. 27). Such\r\nplates were immediately tried in all parts of the world and were at\r\nonce applied to the English vessels “Conway,” “Leven” and “Barracouta”\r\n(_Trans.

Trans._ for 1833, pp.\r\n667–675, Plates XVII, XVIII. He remarks that the very spot where his\r\nofficer found the needle perpendicular, “that is, the pole itself, is\r\nprecisely that point in my globe and chart in which, by supposing all\r\nthe lines to meet, the several curves would best preserve their unity\r\nof character, both separately and conjointly as a system” (eighth\r\n“Britan.,” Vol. XIV, note, p. 50; Noad, “Manual,” p. 617; D. Olmstead,\r\n“Intr. to Nat. Phil.,” 1835, p. 192).\r\n\r\nMr. Barlow’s electro-magnetic globe was exhibited by Dr. Birkbeck in\r\nhis lectures on “Electro-Magnetism” at the London Institution, May\r\n26, 1824. (Its construction is fully described, more particularly, at\r\np. 65 of the English “Encycl. Brit.” (Magnetism); p. 91 of the “Lib.\r\nof Useful Knowledge” (Electro-Magnetism); pp. 139–140, Vol. I of the\r\n_Edin. Jour. of Science_, London, 1826, and pp. 120–122, Part III of\r\nHarris’ “Rud. Mag.”) Its purpose was to show that what had hitherto\r\nbeen considered as the magnetism of the earth might be only modified\r\nelectricity, and it was also intended to illustrate the theory advanced\r\nby M. Ampère, who, as is well known, attributed all magnetic phenomena\r\nto electric currents. In the words of Dr. Brewster:\r\n\r\n“Barlow considers it as probable that magnetism as a distinct quality\r\nhas no existence in Nature. As all the phenomena of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism can be explained on the supposition that the magnetic power\r\nresides on its surface, it occurred to Mr. Barlow that if he could\r\ndistribute over the surface of an artificial globe a series of galvanic\r\ncurrents in such a way that their tangential power should everywhere\r\ngive a corresponding direction to the needle, this globe would exhibit,\r\nwhile under electrical induction, all the magnetic phenomena of the\r\nearth upon a needle freely suspended above it. Mr. Barlow says ‘he\r\nhas proved the existence of a force competent to produce all the\r\nphenomena without the aid of any body usually called magnetic,’ yet\r\nhe acknowledges that ‘we have no idea how such a system of currents\r\ncan have existence on the earth, because, to produce them, we have\r\nbeen obliged to employ a particular arrangement of metals, acids, and\r\nconductors.’”\r\n\r\nBarlow was the first to test the practicability of Ampère’s suggestion\r\nthat by sending the galvanic current through long wires connecting two\r\ndistant stations, the deflections of enclosed magnetic needles would\r\nconstitute very simple and efficient signals for an instantaneous\r\ntelegraph (_Ann. de Chimie et de Phys._, 1820, Vol. XV. pp. 72, 73). He\r\nhas thus stated the result: “In a very early stage of electro-magnetic\r\nexperiments, it had been suggested (by Laplace, Ampère and others) that\r\nan instantaneous telegraph might be established by means of conducting\r\nwires and compasses. The details of this contrivance are so obvious,\r\nand the principle on which it is founded so well understood, that there\r\nwas only one question which could render the result doubtful; and this\r\nwas, is there any diminution of effect by lengthening the conducting\r\nwires? It had been said that the electric fluid from a common (tinfoil)\r\nelectric battery had been transmitted through a wire four miles in\r\nlength without any sensible diminution of effect, and, to every\r\nappearance, instantaneously; and if this should be found to be the case\r\nwith the galvanic circuit, then no question could be entertained of\r\nthe practicability and utility of the suggestion above adverted to. I\r\nwas therefore induced to make the trial; but I found such a sensible\r\ndiminution with only 200 feet of wire, as at once to convince me of the\r\nimpracticability of the scheme. It led me, however, to an inquiry as\r\nto the cause of the diminution, and the laws by which it is governed.”\r\nThis passage is quoted in “Smithsonian Report” for 1878, p. 279; Fahie,\r\n“Hist. El. Tel.,” p. 306; “Memor. of Jos. Henry,” 1880, pp. 223, 224,\r\nthe last named containing the following footnote: “On the Laws of\r\nElectro-Magnetic Action,” _Edinburgh Philosophical Journal_, Jan.,\r\n1825, Vol. XII. pp. 105–113:\r\n\r\n“In explanation and justification of this discouraging judgment from\r\nso high an authority in magnetics, it must be remembered that both in\r\nthe galvanometer and in the electro-magnet, the coil best calculated to\r\nproduce large effects was that of least resistance; which unfortunately\r\nwas not that best adapted to a long circuit. On the other hand the most\r\nefficient magnet or galvanometer was not found to be improved in result\r\nby increasing the number of galvanic elements. Barlow in his inquiry as\r\nto the law of diminution was led (erroneously) to regard the resistance\r\nof the conducting wire as increasing in the ratio of _the square_\r\nroot of its length” (pp. 110, 111 of the last-cited “Journal.)”]\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor justly adds that subsequent experiments have proved Ohm’s\r\nlaw (announced three years after Barlow’s) of a simple ratio of\r\nresistance to length as approximately correct.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--G.

Henry Barlow, second son of Peter Barlow, is the author of a\r\ntreatise, “On the spontaneous electrical currents observed in the wires\r\nof the electric telegraph,” which was published in London during 1849\r\nand appeared in Part I of the _Phil. Trans._, for that year. He is also\r\nthe inventor of a new electrical machine alluded to herein at Hare\r\n(A.D. 1819), also at p. 130 of the “Annual of Sc. Disc.,” at pp. 76–77\r\nof Noad’s “Manual,” and at p. 428, Vol. XXXVII of the “Philosophical\r\nMagazine.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1820.=--Laplace (Pierre Simon, Marquis de) (1749–1827), a\r\nvery distinguished French astronomer and mathematician, suggests for\r\ntelegraphic purposes the employment of magnetic needles suspended in\r\nmultipliers of wire, in place of the voltameters of Sömmering, and on\r\nthe 2nd of October 1820 his theory is thus explained by Ampère in a\r\npaper read before the French Academy of Sciences:\r\n\r\n“According to the success of the experiment to which Laplace drew my\r\nattention, one could, by means of as many pairs of live wires and\r\nmagnetic needles as there are letters of the alphabet, and by placing\r\neach letter on a separate needle, establish, by the aid of a distant\r\npile, and which could be made to communicate by its two extremities\r\nwith those of each pair of conductors, a sort of telegraph, which\r\nwould be capable of indicating all the details that one would wish to\r\ntransmit through any number of obstacles to a distant observer. By\r\nadapting to the battery a keyboard whose keys were each marked with\r\nthe same letters and establishing connection (with the various wires)\r\nby their depression, this means of correspondence could be established\r\nwith great facility, and would only occupy the time necessary for\r\npressing down the keys at the one station and to read off the letters\r\nfrom the deflected needles at the other.”\r\n\r\nLaplace is, perhaps, best known by his “Traité de Mécanique Céleste,”\r\nthe sixteen books and supplements to which are by many considered, next\r\nto Newton’s “Principia,” the greatest of astronomical works; a book\r\nwhich has been truly said to have had no predecessor and which has been\r\ncalled the crowning glory of Laplace’s scientific career. His next\r\nimportant work was the “Théorie Analytique des Probabilités,” the most\r\nmathematically profound treatise on the subject which had yet appeared,\r\nwhile his “Système du Monde” was called by Arago “one of the most\r\nperfect monuments of the French language.” By Prof. Nichols, Laplace is\r\ncalled “the titanic geometer”; by Mr. Airy “the greatest mathematician\r\nof the past age”; by Prof. Forbes “a sort of exemplar or type of the\r\nhighest class of mathematical natural philosophers of this, or rather\r\nthe immediately preceding age.”\r\n\r\nLaplace also wrote, in conjunction with Lavoisier, a treatise “On the\r\nElectricity which Bodies Absorb when Reduced to Vapor” (_Mém. de\r\nParis_ for 1781). Prof. Denison Olmstead, treating of the origin\r\nof atmospherical electricity (“Introd. to Nat.

Cycl.,” Biography, Vol. II. p. 977).\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1820.=--Dutrochet (René Joachim Henri) (1776–1847) a\r\ndistinguished French natural philosopher, and likewise medical adviser\r\nto the King of Spain, Joseph Bonaparte, publishes an interesting\r\ntreatise on meteors, in conjunction with Mr. Nathaniel Bowditch, who\r\nhad already written many very able papers on astronomical subjects and\r\nwho afterwards translated the “Mécanique Céleste” of Laplace. Eight\r\nyears later (1828) appeared Dutrochet’s “Nouvelles Recherches ...”\r\nwherein he attributes to electricity the direction taken by fluids\r\nthrough animal and vegetable membranes. The passage of a fluid from\r\nwithout inwardly he called _endosmosis_, and the passage of the\r\nfluid from within outwardly he termed _exosmosis_.\r\n\r\nOf Dutrochet, Dr. John Hutton Balfour, of Edinburgh, makes mention\r\nwhen treating of the temperature of plants. He thus expresses himself:\r\n“While the nutritive processes are going on in the plant, there is a\r\ncertain amount of heat produced. This, however, is speedily carried\r\naway by evaporation and other causes, and it is not easily rendered\r\nevident. Dutrochet, by means of Becquerel’s thermo-electric needle,\r\nshowed an evolution of heat in plants. In doing this, he prevented\r\nevaporation by putting the plant in a moist atmosphere. In these\r\ncircumstances the temperature of the active vegetating parts, the\r\nroots, the leaves, and the young shoots, indicated a temperature above\r\nthe air of ½ to ¾ of a degree Fahrenheit. Van Beek and Bergsma, in\r\ntheir experiments on the _Hyacinthus Orientalis_ and the _Entelea\r\nArborescens_, found the proper heat of the active parts of plants about\r\n1·8° F. above that of the air. The vital or proper heat of plants,\r\naccording to Dutrochet, is found chiefly in the green plants, and it\r\nundergoes a quotidian paroxysm, reaching the maximum during the day,\r\nand the minimum during the night. When stems become hard and ligneous,\r\nthey lose this vital heat. Large green cotyledons gave indications of\r\na proper heat. The hour of quotidian maximum varied from 10 a.m. to 3\r\np.m. in different plants.”\r\n\r\nIt is stated by Becquerel that in the act of vegetation, the earth\r\nacquires continually an excess of positive electricity, while the bark\r\nand part of the wood receive an excess of negative electricity. The\r\nleaves act like the green part of the parenchyma of the bark--that is\r\nto say, the sap which circulates in their tissues is negative with\r\nrelation to the wood, to the pith, and to the earth, and positive with\r\nregard to the cambium. The electric effects observed in vegetables are\r\ndue to chemico-vital action, and he asserts that the opposite electric\r\nstates of vegetables and of the earth give reason to think that, from\r\nthe enormous vegetation in certain parts of the globe, they must exert\r\nsome influence on the electric phenomena of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Gmelin’s “Chemistry,” Vol. I. p. 447; “Biog.\r\n   Gén.,” Vol. XV. p. 506; Poggendorff, “Annalen,” Vol. I. p. 663;\r\n   Larousse, “Dict.

Ital.,” Vol. XXVII. p. 107 for references to the “Annals\r\nof Philosophy,” in which he mentions an experiment upon a young poplar,\r\n“whereby it would seem that copper was imbibed in the branches, etc.,\r\nfrom a solution placed at its roots, and that it was precipitated on a\r\nknife used to cut off a branch.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=A.D. 1820.=--Brewster (Sir David) (1781–1868), a very distinguished\r\nEnglish natural philosopher and writer, who had just founded the\r\n“Edinburgh Philosophical Journal” in conjunction with Prof. Robert\r\nJameson, announces his discovery of the existence of two poles of\r\ngreatest cold on opposite sides of the northern pole of the earth.\r\nBy this he was, like other authors, led to the belief that there\r\nmight be some connection between the magnetic poles and those of\r\nmaximum cold, and he remarks (Noad “Manual,” London, 1859, p. 545,\r\nand article “Magnetism” in “Encycl. Brit.”): “Imperfect as the\r\nanalogy is between the isothermal and magnetic centres, it is yet too\r\nimportant to be passed over without notice. Their local coincidence\r\nis sufficiently remarkable, and it would be to overstep the limits of\r\nphilosophical caution to maintain that they have no other connection\r\nbut that of accidental locality; and if we had as many measures of\r\nthe mean temperature as we have of the variation of the needle, we\r\nmight determine whether the isothermal poles were fixed or movable.”\r\nSimilar opinions entertained by Dr. Dalton, Dr. Traill and Mr. Christie\r\nare also mentioned by Noad, who quotes from Oersted’s treatise on\r\n“Thermo-Electricity” the statement of the Danish philosopher “that the\r\nmost efficacious excitation of electricity upon the earth appears to be\r\nproduced by the sun, causing daily evaporation, deoxidation and heat,\r\nall of which excite electrical currents.”\r\n\r\nFrom his able paper in the _Edinburgh Philosophical Transactions_\r\nfor 1820, one is led to share Sir David Brewster’s belief “that two\r\nmeridians of greatest heat and two of greatest cold are called into\r\nplay, and that the magnetism of our globe depends in great measure\r\nupon electro or rather thermo-magnetic currents.” The electro-magnetic\r\nhypothesis was, he says, ably supported by Prof. Barlow in his paper\r\n“On the probable electric origin of all the phenomena of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism,” communicated to the _Phil. Trans._ for 1831. Brewster\r\nthus locates the two poles of maximum cold: The American pole in N.\r\nLat. 73, and W. Long. 100 from Greenwich, a little to the East of Cape\r\nWalker; the Asiatic pole in N. Lat. 73 and E. Long. 80, between Siberia\r\nand Cape Matzol, on the Gulf of Oby. Hence the two warm meridians will\r\nbe in W. Long. 10 and E. Long. 170, and the two cold meridians in W.\r\nLong. 100 and E. Long. 80.\r\n\r\nAs has already been indicated (under A.D. 1717, Leméry), Sir David\r\nBrewster was the discoverer of the pyro-electrical condition of the\r\ndiamond, the garnet, the amethyst, etc. His development of some of\r\nHaüy’s experiments led to a similar discovery, attaching to several\r\nmineral salts as well as to the plates and powders of the tourmaline,\r\nof the scolezite and the melozite; and he likewise experimented with\r\nthe boracite, mesotype and with the several minerals and artificial\r\ncrystals detailed at pp. 208–215, Vol. I of the _Edin. Jour. of\r\nScience_, London, 1826; and in Chap. II. s. 1, vol. viii of the eighth\r\n“Encycl. Brit.,” article on “Electricity.”\r\n\r\nAt Part I. chap. i. s. 6 of the last-named article will be found\r\nBrewster’s observations on the nature and origin of electrical light,\r\nhis latest researches having been made, like those of Joseph von\r\nFraunhofer (see A.D. 1814–1815), on the dark and on the luminous lines\r\nwhich appear in the spectrum formed from it by a prism.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1831 appeared Brewster’s “Treatise on Optics,” his\r\n“Life of Sir Isaac Newton,” and his “Letters on Natural Magic.” It\r\nis in one of the chapters of the last-named work that he treats of\r\nautomatic talking machines and remarks: “We have no doubt that before\r\nanother century is completed a talking and a singing machine will be\r\nnumbered among the conquests of science.”\r\n\r\nBrewster’s other scientific treatises are too numerous and cover too\r\nwide a range to be enumerated here. The “Catal. of Sci. Papers of the\r\nRoy. Soc.” (Vol. I. pp. 612–623) gives the titles of as many as 299\r\ncontributions made by him on important subjects, and he has had no less\r\nthan 76 papers in the first 39 parts of the _North British Review_, 30\r\nin the _Phil. Trans._ and 28 in the _Edin. Review_. They appear, in\r\nfact, in all the prominent publications of his time, and have won for\r\nhim leading honours, more especially from the Edinburgh and Aberdeen\r\nUniversities and the Scotch, Irish, English and French Societies, the\r\nFrench Academy of Sciences doing him the signal honour of selecting him\r\nas one of its eight foreign associates in place of Berzelius, deceased.\r\nConjointly with Davy, Herschel and Charles Babbage, he originated the\r\nBritish Association during 1831, and it was in this same year that\r\nhe was knighted and decorated by King William IV. He had been made a\r\nFellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1808, and had during the\r\nsame year undertaken the editorship of the “Edinburgh Encyclopædia of\r\nSci., Lit. and Art.” This he continued for twenty-two years, after\r\nwhich he edited the _Edin. Jour. of Sci._, and also entered with Taylor\r\nand Phillips upon the editorship of the _London and Edin. Phil. Mag.\r\nand Journal_. Many of our readers will doubtless be glad to know that\r\nthe last named was a continuation of the well-known _Philosophical\r\nMagazine_ so often quoted in this “Bibliographical History.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--The obituary notice contributed by Dr. J.

A similar\r\ninfluence was perceptible on placing magnets in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe chronometers. This conclusion was confirmed by experiments made for\r\nthis purpose by Mr. Barlow, who ascertained that masses of iron devoid\r\nof all permanent magnetism occasioned an alteration in the rates of\r\nchronometers placed in different positions in their vicinity.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Fisher’s article “On the Errors in Longitude as\r\n   Determined by Chronometers at Sea, Arising from the Action of\r\n   the Iron in the Ships upon the Chronometers,” communicated\r\n   by John Barrow, F.R.S., to the _Phil.

Snow), member of the College of Surgeons, and\r\na very distinguished English scientist (1791–1867), proposes to the\r\nBoard of the Admiralty his system of lightning conductors, of which an\r\naccount appears at p. 231, Vol. LX of the _Phil. Mag._, as well as in\r\na separate work published at London during 1822. This is followed by\r\nhis “Observations on the Effects of Lightning ...” 1823, and by papers\r\nrelative to the defence of ships and buildings from lightning, which\r\nwere published, more particularly, in several numbers of the _Nautical\r\nMagazine_, the _Phil. Mag._, the _Annals of Electricity_, and in the\r\n_Proc. Lond. Elec. Soc._ for 1842, as well as in his “Record of Phil.\r\nPapers,” and under separate heads during many years between 1827 and\r\n1854. One of his biographers remarks:\r\n\r\n“His researches have gone far to remove certain popular errors as to\r\nwhat have been called ‘conductors’ and ‘non-conductors’ of electricity,\r\nand to show the inutility of the old form of lightning rod in the\r\nmajority of cases; it being necessary, in place of such rod form, to\r\nlink into one great chain all the metallic bodies employed in the\r\nconstruction of a building, thus providing a connection with these\r\nconductors between the highest parts and the ground, the single\r\nconductor, in one highest part, being possibly insufficient to divert\r\nthe course of the fluid and protect the whole fabric. These general\r\nprinciples have been largely applied to the protection of the ships of\r\nthe Royal Navy during the last five and twenty years, under his advice\r\nand direction; and, laying aside the opinions which had been commonly\r\nreceived, the masts themselves of a ship have all been rendered\r\nperfectly conducting by incorporating with the spars capacious plates\r\nof copper, whilst all the large metallic masses in the hull have been\r\ntied, as it were, into a general conducting chain, communicating with\r\nthe great conducting channels in the masts, and with the sea. This may\r\nbe considered as the greatest experiment ever made by any country in\r\nthe employment of metallic conductors for ships, and the result has\r\nbeen to secure the navy from a destructive agent, and to throw new\r\nlight upon an interesting department of science” (Whewell, “Hist. of\r\nInduc. Sci.,” Vol. II. pp. 199, 200; _Phil. Mag._ for March 1841;\r\neighth “Encycl. Britannica,” Vols. VIII. pp. 535, 610, 611, and XX. p.\r\n24; “Edin. Review” for Oct. 1844, Vol. LXXX. pp. 444–473).\r\n\r\nHarris was the first, says Brewster, who introduced accurate\r\nquantitative measures into the investigation of the laws of statical\r\nelectricity--the unit measure by which quantity is minutely\r\nestimated--and also the hydro-electrometer and scale-beam balance by\r\nwhich its intensity and the laws of attractive forces at all distances\r\nare demonstrated. Of not less value is the thermo-electrometer, by\r\nwhich the heating effects of given quantities of electricity are\r\nmeasured and rendered comparable with the varying conditions of\r\nquantity and intensity. Besides these instruments, we owe to Harris\r\nthe discovery of a new reactive force, through which repulsion and\r\nother small physical forces are investigated and determined by means\r\nof his bifilar balance, founded upon the reactive force of two\r\nvertically suspended parallel threads when twined upon each other at\r\na given angle, and acted upon by a suspended weight. With the aid of\r\nthese instruments he has carried on a variety of important inquiries\r\ninto the laws of electrical forces, and the laws and operations of\r\nelectrical accumulation (eighth “Brit.,” Vol. VIII. p. 535). His\r\npapers on the subject appeared in 1825 and 1828, and a _résumé_\r\nof them is given by Noad (“Manual” 1859, pp. 35, 137–140), as well\r\nas in the “Electricity” article of the “Britannica,” both of which\r\ncontain descriptions and illustrations of Harris’ unit jar and\r\nelectro-thermometer.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1827 Mr. Harris published in the _Trans. Roy. Soc. of\r\nEdinburgh_ his memoir entitled “Experimental Inquiries Concerning\r\nthe Laws of Magnetic Forces,” which experiments were made by means\r\nof a new and very accurate apparatus invented by him for examining\r\nthe phenomena of induced magnetism. The above was followed by two\r\nother memoirs, published in the _Phil.

R. S. in 1831, and received the Copley medal\r\nfour years later. It was in 1843 he published his well-known work “On\r\nthe Nature of Thunderstorms,” the plans he advocated being adopted in\r\n1847, when he received the order of knighthood as well as a large money\r\ngrant from the English Government in acknowledgment of his scientific\r\nservices. The following appears in the obituary notice of Sir Wm. Snow\r\nHarris, contributed by Mr. Charles Tomlinson to the _Proceedings of\r\nthe Roy. Soc._ (XVI, 1868):\r\n\r\n“Harris’ sympathies were with the Bennetts, the Cavendishes, the\r\nSingers, the Voltas of a past age. Frictional electricity was his\r\n_forte_ and the source of his triumphs. He was bewildered and\r\ndazzled by the electrical development of the present day, and almost\r\nshut his eyes to it. He was attached too closely and exclusively to\r\nthe old school of science to recognize the broad and sweeping advance\r\nof the new. He was not conscious even of being behind his age when\r\nhe presented to the Royal Society in 1861 an elaborate paper on an\r\nimproved form of Bennett’s discharger, and still less in 1864, when he\r\ndiscussed the laws of electrical distribution, and yet relied upon the\r\nLeyden jar and the unit jar.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--_Trans. of the Plymouth Institution_, also _Trans.\r\n   of the Roy.

Of all these scientists, Ampère proved\r\nthe most energetic, and, within three months of the announcement of\r\nOersted’s discovery, his first memoir on the subject was publicly read\r\nin Paris.\r\n\r\nIn this first paper, Sept. 18, he explains the law determining the\r\nposition of the magnetic needle in relation to the electric current,\r\nand he also makes known his intended experiments with spiral or helical\r\nwires, which he predicts will acquire and retain the properties of\r\nmagnets so long as the electrical current flows through them. He\r\nlikewise explains his theory of magnets, saying that if we assume a\r\nmagnet to consist of an assemblage of minute currents of electricity\r\nwhirling all with the same direction of rotation around the steel\r\nmolecules and in planes at right angles to the axis of the bar, we will\r\nhave an hypothesis which will account for all the known properties of a\r\nmagnet. He constructed his spirals and helices, and to the astonishment\r\nof all, he produced magnets formed only of spools of copper wire\r\ntraversed by electric currents. We can readily imagine, adds Prof.\r\nA. M. Mayer, the intense interest awakened by this discovery, a\r\ndiscovery which caused Arago to exclaim, “What would Newton, Halley,\r\nDufay, Æpinus, Franklin and Coulomb have said if one had told them\r\nthat the day would come when a navigator would be able to lay the\r\ncourse of his vessel without a magnetic needle and solely by means\r\nof electric currents?” “The vast field of physical science,” says\r\nArago, “perhaps never presented so brilliant a discovery, conceived,\r\nverified and completed with such rapidity.” Thus Ampère became the\r\nauthor of a beautiful generalization, which not only included the\r\nphenomena exhibited by the new combinations of Oersted, but also\r\ndisclosed forces existing in arrangements already familiar, although\r\nthey were never detected till it was thus pointed out how they were to\r\nbe looked for. His electro-dynamic theory of the action of currents\r\nand of magnets has been thought worthy of a place near the Principia\r\nof Newton ... it deservedly gained for him the title of the Newton of\r\nelectro-dynamics, as he did for this branch of science even more than\r\nCoulomb had previously done for electro-statics (Profs. A. M. Mayer and\r\nW. B. Rogers, “Memorial of Jos. Henry,” 1880, pp. 81, 476; Lardner,\r\n“Lectures,” 1859, Vol. II. p. 120; Fahie, “Hist. Tel.,” p. 276).\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Oersted and Ampère were at once greatly extended\r\nby many scientists, among whom may be especially mentioned MM.\r\nYelin, Bœckmann, Van Beek, De la Rive, Moll, Nobili, Barlow and\r\nCumming. The last named apparently gave the earliest notice of the\r\nincreased effects of a convolution of wire around the magnetic needle,\r\nand constructed the first astatic needle galvanometer (_Trans.\r\nCamb. Soc._, Vol. I. p. 279). The Chevalier Julius Konrad Yelin\r\n(1771–1826), German mathematician, ascertained that the electricity\r\nof an ordinary machine when passed along a helix, either in simple\r\nelectrical sparks or by discharges from a battery, has the effect\r\nof rendering an included needle magnetic. According to Dr. Henry,\r\nM. Bœckmann found in varying these experiments that no modification\r\nof the effect is produced by altering the diameter of the helix\r\nfrom half an inch to thirteen inches. With a helix of thirty-four\r\ninches diameter, and a coated surface of 300 square inches, much less\r\nmagnetism was, however, imparted; and with one of eighty-four inches\r\nit was scarcely perceptible. It was found that a needle outside of the\r\nhelix was magnetized as much as one within; that after being once fully\r\nmagnetized a continuation of the discharges diminished its power; and\r\nthat five jars, each of 300 square inches, did not produce, by repeated\r\ndischarges, much more effect than one of them (Poggendorff, Vol. II. p.\r\n1382; Gilbert’s _Annalen_ for 1820–1823).\r\n\r\nIn his second paper, Sept. 25 (_Ann. de Chim. et de Phys._, Vol.\r\nXV. pp. 59–170), Ampère makes known the results of his experiments on\r\nthe mutual attractions and repulsions of electrical currents, showing\r\nconclusively that when the voltaic current is passed in the same\r\ndirection through two parallel wires, so placed as to move freely,\r\nthey attract each other, and that they are repelled if the currents\r\nare passed in opposite directions. Thus he establishes the second\r\nfundamental law of electro-magnetism, the first law, instituted as\r\nwe have seen by Oersted, being that the magnetical effect of the\r\nelectrical current is a circular motion around the current. In the\r\nlast-named paper he also proposes the hypothesis of currents of\r\nelectricity circulating from east to west around the terrestrial\r\nglobe in planes at right angles to the direction of the dipping\r\nneedle, to account for the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism (Roget,\r\n“Electro-Magn.,” p. 47).\r\n\r\nIn his third paper, Oct. 9, Ampère investigates the properties of\r\ncurrents transmitted through wires forming closed curves (_courbes\r\nfermées_) or complete geometrical figures, an inquiry also alluded\r\nto in another memoir read Oct. 30, 1820.\r\n\r\nThese papers were immediately followed by others, which engaged nearly\r\nall the sittings of the Academy between Dec. 4, 1820, and Jan. 15,\r\n1821. In these he brings forth new confirmations of his theories, and\r\nreduces the phenomena of electro-magnetism to mathematical analysis.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel Prime remarks (“Life of Morse,” 1875, p. 266) that the\r\ndiscovery of the action of the spiral coil upon the magnetic needle\r\nseems to have been independently made by Ampère in 1821:\r\n\r\n“I showed that the current which is in the pile acts on the magnetic\r\nneedle by the conjunctive wire. I described the instrument, which I\r\nproposed to construct, and, among others, the galvanic spiral. I read\r\na note upon the electro-chemical effects of a spiral of iron wire,\r\nsubjected to the action of the earth, directing an electric current\r\nas well as a magnet. I announced the new fact of the attraction and\r\nrepulsion of two electric currents, without the intermediation of any\r\nmagnet, a fact which I had observed in conductors twisted spirally\r\n(Tilloch’s _Journal of Science_, Vol. LVII. p. 47, 1821).\r\n\r\nOne of his biographers, Professor Chrystal says: “Scarcely had the\r\nnews of Oersted’s discovery reached France, when a French philosopher,\r\nAmpère, set to work to develop the important consequences which it\r\ninvolved. Physicists had long been looking for the connection between\r\nmagnetism and electricity, and had, perhaps, inclined to the view that\r\nelectricity was somehow to be explained as a magnetic phenomenon. It\r\nwas, in fact, under the influence of such ideas, that Oersted was led\r\nto his discovery. Ampère showed that the explanation was to be found\r\nin an opposite direction. He discovered the ponderomotive action of\r\none electric current on another, and, by a series of well-chosen\r\nexperiments, he established the elementary laws of electro-dynamic\r\naction, starting from which, by a brilliant train of mathematical\r\nanalysis, he not only evolved the complete explanation of all the\r\nelectro-magnetic phenomena observed before him, but predicted many\r\nhitherto unknown. The results of his researches may be summarized\r\nin the statement that an electric current, in a linear circuit of\r\nany form, is equivalent in its action, whether on magnets or other\r\ncircuits, to a magnetic shell bounded by the circuit, whose strength\r\nat every point is constant and proportional to the strength of the\r\ncurrent. By his beautiful theory of molecular currents, he gave a\r\ntheoretical explanation of that connection between electricity and\r\nmagnetism which had been the dream of previous investigators. _If\r\nwe except the discovery of the laws of the induction of electric\r\ncurrents_, made about ten years later by Faraday, _no advance in\r\nthe science of electricity can compare for completeness and brilliancy\r\nwith the work of Ampère_. Our admiration is equally great,\r\nwhether we contemplate the clearness and power of his mathematical\r\ninvestigations, the aptness and skill of his experiments, or the\r\nwonderful rapidity with which he elucidated his discovery when he had\r\nonce found the clew.”\r\n\r\n“Oersted,” remarks M. Babinet, “was the Christopher Columbus of\r\nmagnetism; Ampère became its Pizarro and its Fernand Cortez.”\r\n\r\nOf Ampère’s _astatic_ needles, a description, taken from one of\r\nhis memoirs (_Ann. de Ch. et de Ph._, Vol. XVIII. p. 320), appears\r\nat pp. 280–281 of Fahie’s “History” (Knight’s “Mech. Dict.,” 1874, Vol.\r\nI. p. 171, and Vol. II. p. 1181). For this greatly perfected form of\r\ngalvanometer the credit has erroneously been given to Prof. Cumming,\r\nwho first suggested the idea of neutralizing the directive force of\r\nthe needle arising from the earth’s magnetism, which he did by placing\r\na magnetized needle immediately beneath the movable or index needle.\r\nFahie adds, in a footnote: “In Prof. Cumming’s paper ‘On the Connection\r\nof Galvanism and Magnetism,’ read before the Cambridge Philosophical\r\nSociety, April 2, 1821, he described a near approach to the astatic\r\nneedle. In order to neutralize the terrestrial magnetism he placed\r\na small magnetized needle under the galvanometer needle” (_Trans.\r\nCam. Phil. Soc._, Vol. I. p. 279). The credit of Ampère’s discovery\r\nis sometimes given to Nobili, as in Noad’s “Manual of Electricity,”\r\nLondon, 1859, p. 327; also Roget’s “Electro-Magnetism” in “Library of\r\nUseful Knowledge,” London, 1832, p. 42.\r\n\r\nAs has been already shown (Laplace, A.D. 1820), the first proposal to\r\napply Oersted’s discovery to telegraphic purposes by substituting the\r\ndeflection of the magnetic needle through electric currents for the\r\ndivergence of the pith balls of the electroscope, was made by Ampère,\r\nin his Memoir of Oct. 2, 1820, which appears in the _Comptes Rendus_,\r\nand at p. 72, Vol. XV of the _Annales de Chimie et de Physique_. His\r\nplan, remarks Sabine, was, however, doomed to the same fate as that of\r\nSömmering, of never coming into practice, and for the same reasons,\r\nprincipally the number of line wires. Had Ampère combined his system,\r\nor rather the one of Laplace, with that which Schweigger proposed of\r\nreducing Sömmering’s telegraph to two wires, or with any other using a\r\ncode of signals, the problem of the electric telegraph would have been\r\nsolved from the year 1820. Ampère makes no mention of surrounding the\r\nneedles with _coils of wire_, as is so frequently stated by writers\r\non the telegraph. Indeed he could not then have even heard of the\r\ngalvanometer; for, although Schweigger’s paper on the subject was read\r\nat Halle on the 16th of September 1820, it was not published until the\r\nNovember following.\r\n\r\nM.

Into the axis of a galvanic conductor made\r\nin the form of a coil, or helix, he placed a needle, the extremities\r\nof the wire coil being connected to the poles of a battery, and\r\nwith this he proved that the wire not only acted on bodies already\r\nmagnetized, but that it could develop magnetism in such as did not\r\nalready possess the power. When soft iron was used, the magnetism\r\ngiven was only temporary, but on repeating the experiment, M. Arago\r\nsucceeded completely in permanently magnetizing small steel needles.\r\nArago’s paper on the subject appears at p. 94, Vol. XV of the _Ann.\r\nde Ch. et de Ph._, and it is said that at about the same time Dr.\r\nThos. J. Seebeck (1770–1831), and Georg Friedrich Pohl (1788–1849) laid\r\nsimilar results before the Berlin Academy, also that Sir Humphry Davy\r\nindependently made a like discovery, of which he advised Dr. Wollaston,\r\nNov. 12, 1820. Reference to this fact has already been made at Davy,\r\nunder date A.D. 1801, wherein it was stated that the latter\r\nhad found iron filings to so adhere to the connecting wire as to form\r\na mass ten or twelve times the thickness of the wire. This was also\r\nthe case in the experiments of M. Arago, who, upon observing that the\r\nfilings rose before coming in contact with the conjugate wire, drew the\r\nconclusion that each small piece of iron was converted into a temporary\r\nmagnet. Thus was Arago led to the discovery of what is called magnetic\r\ninduction by electric currents, or, in other words, that an electrical\r\ncurrent passing through a conductor will induce magnetic action in such\r\nbodies near it as are capable of being magnetized (_Phil. Trans._\r\nfor 1821, p. 9; Tilloch’s _Jour. of Sci._, Vol. LVII. p. 42, 1821;\r\neighth “Britannica,” Vol. VIII. p. 532 and Vol. XIV. p. 640; Thomas\r\nThomson, “Outline of the Sciences,” p. 563).\r\n\r\nA fact worth noting in connection with the development of Oersted’s\r\ndiscovery by both Arago and Ampère, is that in order “to prevent the\r\ncommunication of the electricity laterally in the folds of the coil,\r\nthe wire was insulated by varnish in the first instance and afterward\r\nby winding silk or cotton around it” (F. C. Bakewell, “Elec. Sci.,”\r\nLondon, 1853, p. 37).\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of November 1824, Arago announced to the French Academy\r\nof Sciences the remarkable discovery made by him of a new source of\r\nmagnetism in rotatory motion. He was led to this by observing that\r\nwhen a magnetic needle was oscillating above or close by any body,\r\nsuch as water or a plate of metal, it gradually oscillated in arcs of\r\nless and less amplitude, as if it were standing in a resisting medium,\r\nand, besides, that the oscillations performed in a given time were the\r\nsame in number (Humboldt’s “Cosmos,” “Magnetic Observations,” 1825).\r\nHe caused a circular copper plate to revolve immediately beneath a\r\nmagnetic needle or magnet, freely suspended so that the latter might\r\nrotate in a plane parallel to that of the copper plate, and he found\r\nthat the needle tends to follow the circumvolution of the plate; that\r\nit will deviate from its true direction, and that by increasing the\r\nvelocity of the plate the deviation will increase till the needle\r\npasses the opposite point, when it will continue to revolve, and at\r\nlast with such rapidity that the eye will be unable to distinguish it.\r\nThis, says Mrs. Somerville, is quite independent of the motion of the\r\nair, since it is the same if a pane of glass be interposed between the\r\nmagnet and the copper. When the magnet and the plate are at rest, not\r\nthe smallest effect, attractive, repulsive, or of any kind, can be\r\nperceived between them. In describing this phenomenon Arago states that\r\nit takes place not only with metals, but with all substances, although\r\nthe intensity depends upon the kind of substance in motion.\r\n\r\nArago’s experiments were repeated in London, March 7, 1825. His\r\nvaluable discovery, which obtained for him the Copley medal, and which\r\nconfirms the doctrine of the universal prevalence of magnetism in\r\nall bodies, is recorded in Arago’s “Sur les Déviations ... aiguille\r\naimantée” (_An. de Ch. et de Ph._, Vol. XXXIII, and _Phil. Trans._,\r\np. 467 for 1825), and a solution of the phenomena is given by Faraday\r\nin _Phil. Trans._ for 1832, p. 146, by Sir John Leslie in the Fifth\r\nDissertation of the eighth “Britannica,” p. 746, as well as in the\r\narticle “Magnetism” of the latter publication, and in Mrs. Somerville’s\r\n“Conn. of Phys. Sc.,” pp. 325–327. (See also the observations recorded\r\nin Humboldt’s “Cosmos,” 1849, Vol. I. pp. 172, 173; in Dr. Thomson’s\r\n“Outline of the Sciences,” pp. 556–558; Fahie, pp. 282, 283, 321; Dr.\r\nWhewell, Vol. II. pp. 254–256; Brewster’s _Edin. Jour. of Sci._, 1826,\r\nVol. III. p. 179; “Dict. Gén. de Biogr. et d’Histoire,” Paris, 2^e ed.\r\np. 126.)\r\n\r\nIn Brewster’s _Edinburgh Journal of Science_ (Vol. V. p. 325), notice\r\nis given of Arago’s then recent researches on the influence which\r\nbodies considered not magnetic have on the motions of the magnetic\r\nneedle, and reference is made to a new communication transmitted\r\nby Arago to the Académie des Sciences, as well as to a report of\r\nadditional experiments in the same line given at meetings held July\r\n3 and 10, 1826. Arago satisfactorily meets the denials made by\r\nLeopoldo Nobili and another Italian natural philosopher (Liberato\r\nGiovanni Bacelli) that substances not metallic have any influence\r\non the magnetic oscillations, and he announces as a result of his\r\ninvestigations that, for certain positions of a vertical needle, and\r\nfor velocities of rotation sufficiently rapid, the repulsive force\r\nwhich is exerted in the direction of the radius is as great as the\r\nforce perpendicular to the radius, of which the effects are observed\r\nupon a horizontal needle.\r\n\r\nPoisson having stated in his memoir “On the Theory of Magnetism” in\r\nmotion (see Poisson at A.D. 1811) that Coulomb had recognized\r\nthe magnetic virtue in all bodies, independently of the iron which\r\nthey contain, Arago remarked that the idea of Coulomb was quite\r\ndifferent from his, Coulomb having been of opinion that a quantity of\r\niron, although too small for chemical analysis even to appreciate, was\r\nsufficient to produce in bodies which contained it appreciable magnetic\r\neffects. MM. Thénard and La Place confirmed this remark. Brewster adds\r\nthat, in justice to Coulomb, it is necessary to state that he is the\r\nundoubted author of the discovery that _all bodies, whether organic\r\nor inorganic, are sensible to the influence of magnetism_. M. Biot\r\nhas remarked that there are two ways of explaining this, _either all\r\nsubstances in nature are susceptible of magnetism, or they all contain\r\nportions of iron, or other magnetic metals, which communicate to them\r\nthis property_. This last explanation, though adopted by Coulomb, by\r\nno means affects his claim to the discovery of the general fact that\r\nall bodies, whether organic or inorganic, are susceptible of becoming\r\nmagnetic. Prof. Hansteen has drawn from numerous experiments and\r\nobservations the important conclusion that _every vertical object, of\r\nwhatever material it is composed, has a magnetic south pole above, and\r\na north pole below_ (_Edin. Phil. Journal_ for January-April\r\n1821).\r\n\r\nM. Arago made many valuable investigations concerning the influence of\r\nthe aurora borealis on the needle, on the variations of the latter,\r\nupon the nature of meteors, lightning, the zodiacal light, magnetic\r\nstorms, etc. etc., which are admirably recorded more particularly in\r\nthe great work of Alex. von Humboldt. The latter remarks that Arago has\r\nleft behind him a treasury of magnetical observations (upward of 52,600\r\nin number) carried on from 1818 to 1835, which have been carefully\r\nedited by M. Fédor Thoman, and published in the “Œuvres Complètes de\r\nFrançois Arago” (Vol. IV. p. 493). Much could be said, especially\r\nregarding Arago’s paper, presented by him to the Academy of Sciences\r\nin 1811, which is considered to have established the foundation of\r\nchromatic polarization. Mention must at any rate be made of the fact\r\nthat in Humboldt’s estimation the discovery of the two kinds of\r\npolarization of light may be considered the most brilliant of the\r\ncentury. They, unquestionably, rank among the most splendid of optical\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nEtienne Louis Malus, a distinguished French philosopher (Fifth Dissert.\r\nof “Encycl. Brit.”), discovered in 1808 polarization by reflection\r\nfrom polished surfaces, and Arago, during 1811, made the discovery of\r\ncoloured polarization. A world of wonder, remarks Humboldt, composed\r\nof manifold modified waves of light having new properties was now\r\nrevealed. A ray of light which reaches our eyes, after traversing\r\nmillions of miles from the remotest regions of heaven, announces\r\nof itself in Arago’s polariscope (consisting of a plate of quartz\r\ncut across the axis placed in one end of a tube, at the other end\r\nof which is a doubly refracting prism) whether it is reflected or\r\nrefracted, whether it emanates from a solid or fluid, or gaseous body,\r\neven announcing the degree of its intensity (Delambre, “Histoire de\r\nl’Astronomie,” p. 652; Humboldt, “Cosmos,” 1849, Vol. I. p. 33; Vol.\r\nII. p. 715).\r\n\r\nIn 1818, Arago was elected a F.R.S.; he became a member of the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society and also member of the Bureau des Longitudes\r\nduring 1822, was made Perpetual Secretary of the Academy and Director\r\nof the Paris Observatory eight years later, and received the Rumford\r\nmedal in 1850. The Copley medal given him in 1825 had never before been\r\nconferred upon a Frenchman of science. It was upon his urgent request\r\nthat the “Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes” and “Les Comptes Rendus\r\nhebdomadaires” were commenced by the Academy, 1828–1835.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Schumacher, Humboldt speaks of Arago as “one gifted with\r\nthe noblest of natures, equally distinguished for intellectual power\r\nand for moral excellence.” In conjunction with Gay-Lussac, Arago was,\r\nfor almost half a century, Humboldt’s most intimate friend, and their\r\never-increasing intimacy became such as to lead to a perfect unity of\r\nthought on scientific subjects. It cannot, therefore, be considered an\r\nexaggerated expression of feeling when, in a letter to Geoffroy St.\r\nHilaire, dated Berlin, June 24, 1829, Humboldt should conclude with the\r\nwords: “Pray remember me to MM. Valenciennes, Deleuze and Cuvier, but\r\nespecially to him whom I hold dearest in this life, to M. Arago.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Poggendorff, Vol. I. pp. 53, 54, and the several\r\n   biographies named at p. 202, Vol. I of “Johnson’s New Univ.\r\n   Cycl.,” 1877; J. A. Barral, “Œuvres de F.

Premising his reference to\r\nthis discovery of Mr. Faraday, whose original papers thereon appear\r\nin the _Quarterly Journal of Sciences and the Arts_, Vol. XII.\r\npp. 75, 186, 283 and 416 (the first bearing date September 11, 1821),\r\nDr. Whewell says that on attempting to analyze the electro-magnetic\r\nphenomena observed by Oersted and others into their simplest forms,\r\nthey appeared, at least at first sight, to be different from any\r\nmechanical actions which had yet been observed. It seemed as if the\r\nconducting wire exerted on the pole of the magnet a force which was not\r\nattractive or repulsive, but _transverse_; not tending to draw the\r\npoint acted on nearer, or to push it further off, in the line which\r\nreached from the acting point, but urging it to move at right angles\r\nto this line. The forces appeared to be such as Kepler had dreamt of\r\nin the infancy of mechanical conceptions, rather than such as those of\r\nwhich Newton had established the presence in the solar system, and such\r\nas he, and all his successors, had supposed to be the only kinds of\r\nforce which exist in nature. The north pole of the needle moved as if\r\nit were impelled by a vortex revolving round the wire in one direction,\r\nwhile the south pole seemed to be driven by an opposite vortex (called\r\nby Wollaston _vertiginous magnetism_ and considered by Mr. Barlow\r\nas the result of _tangential action_). The case seemed novel, and\r\nalmost paradoxical. It was soon established by experiments, made in a\r\ngreat variety of forms, that the mechanical action was really of this\r\ntransverse kind. And a curious result was obtained, which a little\r\nwhile before would have been considered as altogether incredible: that\r\nthis force would cause a constant and rapid revolution of either of the\r\nbodies about the other--of the conducting wire about the magnet, or of\r\nthe magnet about the conducting wire (Vol. XII of the “Journal of the\r\nRoyal Institution”; Watkins, “Popular Sketch of Electro-Magnetism; or\r\nElectro-Dynamics,” London, 1828; Mrs. Somerville, “Connection of Phys.\r\nSciences,” 1846, p. 315).\r\n\r\nPassing over many of Faraday’s important scientific investigations\r\nin other lines, we come to his second great discovery, that of\r\n_magneto-electric induction_, which is the converse of Oersted’s\r\n(developed by Ampère and Arago), the production of electricity by\r\nmagnetism. This is recorded in the first series of “Experimental\r\nResearches in Electricity,” read November 24, 1831 before the Royal\r\nSociety, of which body Faraday had become a Fellow during 1824, and it\r\nis published at p. 125 of the _Phil. Trans._ for 1832.\r\n\r\nIt appears that upon observing certain phenomena, which he described\r\nas _Volta-electric_, he concluded before long that magnetism\r\nin motion ought to produce an electric current just as electricity\r\nwas made to imitate all the effects of magnetism. He carried on many\r\nexperiments, and after the announcements made by Arago to the French\r\nAcademy, November 22, 1824, he endeavoured to make the conducting\r\nwire of the voltaic circuit excite electricity in a neighbouring wire\r\nby induction, just as the conductor charged with common electricity\r\nwould have done, but he obtained no satisfactory results until August\r\n29, 1831 (_Annales de Chimie_, Vol. XLVIII. p. 402). He remarks:\r\n“Certain effects of the induction of electrical currents have already\r\nbeen recognized and described; as those of magnetism; Ampère’s\r\nexperiments of bringing a copper disc near to a flat spiral; his\r\nrepetition, with electro-magnets, of Arago’s extraordinary experiments,\r\nand perhaps a few others. Still it appeared unlikely that these could\r\nbe all the effects which induction by currents could produce....\r\nThese considerations, with their consequence, the hope of obtaining\r\nelectricity from ordinary magnetism, have stimulated me at various\r\ntimes to investigate experimentally the inductive effects of electric\r\ncurrents. I lately arrived at positive results, and not only had my\r\nhopes fulfilled, but obtained a theory which appeared to me to open out\r\na full explanation of Arago’s magnetic phenomena, and also to discover\r\na new state which may probably have great influence in some of the most\r\nimportant effects of electric currents.” His very important conclusion\r\nwas finally verified, October 1–17, in the following manner. He had\r\ntaken a helix, or spool of copper wire, which latter, Prof. Brande\r\ntells us, was covered with silk as in his former experiments and which\r\nwas connected by its extremities with a galvanometer, the deflection of\r\nwhich would of course announce a current of electricity in the spiral\r\nand wires connected with it, and he found that while in the act of\r\nintroducing the pole of a powerful bar-magnet within the coils of the\r\nspiral, a deflection of the galvanometer took place in one direction,\r\nand that when in the act of withdrawing, it took place in the opposite\r\ndirection; so that each time the conducting wire cut the magnetic\r\ncurves, a current of electricity was, for the moment, produced in it.\r\nDr. Whewell’s account of the discovery is so well interspersed with\r\nreferences that it deserves repetition here:\r\n\r\n“In 1831, Faraday again sought for electro-dynamical induction,\r\nand, after some futile trials, at last found it in a form different\r\nfrom that in which he had looked for it. It was then seen, that at\r\nthe precise time of making or breaking the contact which closed the\r\ngalvanic circuit, a momentary effect was induced in a neighbouring\r\nwire, but disappeared instantly (_Phil Trans._, 1832, p. 127,\r\n1st ser., Art. 10). Once in possession of this fact, Mr. Faraday ran\r\nrapidly up the ladder of discovery, to the general point of view.\r\nInstead of suddenly making or breaking the contact of the inducing\r\ncircuit, a similar effect was produced by removing the inducible wire\r\nnearer to or further from the circuit (Art. 18)--the effects were\r\nincreased by the proximity of soft iron (Art. 28)--when the soft iron\r\nwas affected by an ordinary magnet, instead of the voltaic wire, the\r\nsame effect still recurred (Art. 37)--and thus it appeared, that by\r\nmaking and breaking magnetic contact, a momentary electric current was\r\nproduced. It was produced also by moving the magnet (Art. 39)--or by\r\nmoving the wire with reference to the magnet (Art. 53). Finally, it\r\nwas found that the earth might supply the place of a magnet in this as\r\nin other experiments (2nd ser., _Phil. Trans._, p. 163) and the\r\nmere motion of a wire, under proper circumstances, produced in it, it\r\nappeared, a momentary electric current (Art. 141). These facts were\r\ncuriously confirmed by the results in special cases. They explained\r\nArago’s experiments: for the momentary effect became permanent by the\r\nrevolution of the plate. And without using the magnet, a revolving\r\nplate became an electrical machine (Art. 150), a revolving globe\r\nexhibited electro-magnetic action (Art. 164), the circuit being\r\ncomplete in the globe itself without the addition of any wire; and a\r\nmere motion of the wire of a galvanometer produced an electro-dynamic\r\neffect upon its needle (Art. 171).... And thus he was enabled, at the\r\nend of his second series of ‘Researches’ (December 1831), to give,\r\nin general terms, the law of nature to which may be referred the\r\nextraordinary number of new and curious experiments which he has stated\r\n(Arts. 256–264), namely, that if a wire move so as to cut a magnetic\r\ncurve, a power is called into action which tends to urge a magnetic\r\ncurrent through the wire; and that if a mass move so that its parts do\r\nnot move in the same direction across the magnetic curves, and with the\r\nsame angular velocity, electrical currents are called into play in the\r\nmass. And here might properly be added the experimental distinction\r\nbetween a helix and a magnet, which Faraday subsequently pointed out\r\n(‘Exper. Res.,’ Art. 3273): ‘Whereas an unchangeable magnet can never\r\nraise up a piece of soft iron to a state more than equal to its own, as\r\nmeasured by the moving wire, a helix carrying a current can develop in\r\nan iron core magnetic lines of force of a hundred or more times as much\r\npower as that possessed by itself when measured by the same means.’”\r\n\r\nAn article on the reduction of Mr. Faraday’s discoveries in\r\nmagneto-electric induction to a general law appeared in the\r\n“Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society” Vol. III. p. 37, and\r\nat Vol. IV. p. 11, new series, of the _Philosophical Magazine_ (see\r\nFaraday’s first two Memoirs in the _Phil. Trans._, Book XIII. chaps. v\r\nand viii; letter to Gay-Lussac in _Annales de Chimie_, Vol. LI. 1832,\r\npp. 404–434; _Phil. Mag._, Vol. XVII. pp. 281, 356); while, in the\r\n_Phil. Trans._ for 1832, p. 132, is the Report of his production of the\r\nelectric spark through a modified arrangement in which the electric\r\ncurrent was induced by an electro-magnet, as shown in his subsequent\r\nwork published in London during 1834. This is alluded to in Vol. V.\r\npp. 349–354 of the _Phil. Mag._ for latter year, and in Poggendorff’s\r\n_Annalen_, Vol. XXXIV. pp. 292–301 for 1835. (See also Bakewell,\r\n“Elect. Science,” pp. 39, 140, 144.)\r\n\r\n    “Around the magnet, Faraday\r\n    Is sure that Volta’s lightnings play;\r\n    But how to draw them from the wire?\r\n    He took a lesson from the heart\r\n    ’Tis when we meet--’tis when we part,\r\n    Breaks forth the electric fire.”\r\n\r\n    HERBERT MAYO, in _Blackwood_.\r\n\r\nIn Prof. Alfred M. Mayer’s address, delivered before the American\r\nAssociation at Boston, August 26, 1880, we read: “It is not generally\r\nknown or appreciated that Henry and Faraday independently discovered\r\nthe means of producing the electric current and the electric spark from\r\na magnet. Tyndall, in speaking of this great discovery of Faraday,\r\nsays: ‘I cannot help thinking while I dwell upon them, that this\r\ndiscovery of magneto-electricity is the greatest experimental result\r\never obtained by an investigator. It is the Mont Blanc of Faraday’s own\r\nachievements. He always worked at great elevations, but higher than\r\nthis he never subsequently attained.’ And it is this same physicist who\r\nfurther remarks (‘Johnson’s Cycl.,’ Vol. II. pp. 26–27) that all our\r\ninduction coils, our medical machines, and the electric light so far as\r\nit has been applied to lighthouses, are the direct progeny of Faraday’s\r\ndiscovery. In the paper here referred to (Nov. 24, 1831) he for the\r\nfirst time calls the ‘magnetic curves,’ formed when iron-filings are\r\nstrewn around a magnet, ‘lines of magnetic force.’ All his subsequent\r\nresearches upon magnetism were made with reference to those lines. They\r\nenabled him to play like a magician with the magnetic force, guiding\r\nhim securely through mazes of phenomena which would have been perfectly\r\nbewildering without their aid. The spark of the _extra current_, which\r\nI believe was noticed for the first time by Prof. Joseph Henry, had\r\nbeen noticed independently by Mr. William Jenkin. Faraday at once\r\nbrought this observation under the yoke of his discovery, proving that\r\nthe augmented spark was the product of a secondary current evoked by\r\nthe reaction of the primary upon its own wire.” The phenomenon of the\r\nspark from the _extra current_ here alluded to was first announced by\r\nHenry in July 1832. He had observed that when the poles of a battery\r\nare united by means of a short wire of low resistance, no spark or at\r\nleast a very faint one is produced, but when the poles of the battery\r\nare connected by a long copper wire and mercury cups, a brilliant\r\nspark is obtained at the moment the circuit is broken by raising one\r\nend of the wire out of its cup of mercury and also that the longer the\r\nwire and the greater the number of its helical convolutions, the more\r\npowerful would be the effect (Silliman, “Am. Jour. of Sc.,” Vol. XXII).\r\nThe results of Faraday’s investigation of the _extra current_ first\r\nappeared in the _Phil. Mag._ for November 1834.\r\n\r\nThe references already named give an account of many other important\r\nresults attained by Faraday during 1831 and up to the date of the\r\npublication of the third series of his “Experimental Researches” (p.\r\n76), wherein he recognizes the “Identity of Electricities derived from\r\ndifferent sources”[60] (Vol. I. par. 265 and 360), after investigating\r\nthe electricities of the machine, the pile, and of the electrical\r\nfishes, and after employing as conductors the entire plant of the\r\nmetallic gas pipes and water pipes of the city of London (_Phil.\r\nTrans._ for 1833, p. 23; Poggendorff, _Annalen_, Vol. XXIX,\r\n1833, pp. 274, 365).\r\n\r\nIn the fourth series, relating to “A New law of electric conduction”\r\n(Vol. I. par. 380, 381, 394, 410), he demonstrates the influence of\r\nwhat is called “the state of aggregation” upon the transmission of\r\nthe current. He found that although the latter was conveyed through\r\nwater it did not pass through ice. This he subsequently explained by\r\nsaying that the liquid condition enables the molecule of water to turn\r\nround so as to place itself in the proper line of polarization, which\r\nthe rigidity of ice prevents. This polar arrangement must precede\r\ndecomposition, and decomposition is an accompaniment of conduction\r\n(_Phil. Trans._ for 1833, p. 507; Poggendorff, _Annalen_, Vol. XXXI,\r\n1834, p. 225; also _Phil. Mag._, Vol. X. p. 98; “Royal Inst. Proc.,”\r\nVol. II. p. 123; Silliman’s _Journal_, Vol. XXI. p. 368).\r\n\r\nOther series (pars. 309, 450, 453–454, 472, 477, 661–662, 669, etc.)\r\ntreat of “Electro-chemical or electrolytic decomposition.” The\r\nexperiments of Wollaston in this line have been given under the A.D.\r\n1801 date, where Prof. Faraday’s opinion of them is also expressed.\r\nFaraday was successful in the employment of Wollaston’s apparatus for\r\nthe decomposition of water, and he afterwards devised an arrangement\r\nenabling him to effect true electro-chemical decompositions by common\r\nelectricity as well as by the voltaic pile. For this, it is said, he\r\nused an electric battery consisting of fifteen jars and a plate machine\r\nhaving two sets of rubbers and a glass disc fifty inches in diameter,\r\nthe whole presenting a surface of 1422 inches. One revolution of\r\nthe plate could be made to give ten or twelve sparks, each one inch\r\nlong, while the conductors afforded sparks ten to fourteen inches in\r\nlength. He also devised a _discharging train_, to instantaneously\r\ncarry off electricity of the feeblest tension by connecting a thick\r\nwire as he had previously done with the London gas and water pipes. A\r\ngood description of the methods by which he succeeded with the latter\r\napparatus in establishing the analogy between ordinary and voltaic\r\nelectricity is given in the eighth “Britannica,” Vol. VIII. pp.\r\n596–597. He had shown, at paragraph 371 and p. 105 of his “Researches,”\r\nthat as a measure of quantity, a voltaic group of two small wires of\r\nplatinum and zinc, placed near each other, and immersed in dilute\r\nacid for three seconds, yields as much electricity as the electrical\r\nbattery, charged by thirty turns of a large machine; a fact that was\r\nestablished both by its momentary electro-magnetic effect, and by the\r\namount of its chemical action, but, in order to enable him to establish\r\na principle of definite measurement, he devised a _voltameter_ or\r\n_volta-electrometer_ as mentioned at paragraph No. 739 (Noad, “Manual,”\r\np. 365). By means of this apparatus he calculated that a single grain\r\nof water in a voltaic cell will require for its decomposition a\r\nquantity of electricity equal to that liberated in 800,000 discharges\r\nof the great Leyden battery of the Royal Institution (“Researches,”\r\npar. 861). Also, that the decomposition of a single grain of water by\r\nfour grains of zinc in the active cell of the voltaic circle, produces\r\nas great an amount of polarization and decomposition in the cell\r\nof decomposition, as 950,000 charges of a large Leyden battery, of\r\nseveral square feet of coated surface; an enormous quantity of power,\r\nequal to a most destructive thunderstorm. Tyndall remarks (“Notes on\r\nElectricity,” No. 118, also “Faraday as a Discoverer,” 1868, p. 44)\r\nthat Weber and Kohlrausch ascertained that the quantity of electricity\r\nassociated with one milligramme of hydrogen in water, if diffused\r\nover a cloud 1000 metres above the earth, would exert, upon an equal\r\nquantity of the opposite electricity at the earth’s surface, an\r\nattractive force of 2,268,000 kilogrammes.[61]\r\n\r\nFaraday introduced new terms to express more specifically the\r\ncircumstances attending electro-chemical decomposition. Objections\r\nhad long been made to the designation _poles_--one _positive_, the\r\nother _negative_--on the ground that such did not convey a correct\r\nidea of the effects produced. These designations had been given\r\nunder erroneous supposition that the poles exerted an attractive and\r\nrepulsive energy towards the elements of the decomposing liquid, much\r\nas the poles of the magnet act towards iron. When connecting the\r\nextremities of a battery, the electricity simply makes a circuit;\r\nthe current passes _through_ the substance to be decomposed and the\r\nelements remain in operation until the connection is broken. Since the\r\npoles merely act as a path to the current he calls them electrodes\r\n(_electron_, electricity, _odos_, a way); that part of the surface of\r\nthe decomposing matter which the current enters--immediately touching\r\nthe positive pole--he designates as _anode_ (_ana_, upward) and the\r\npart of the matter which the current leaves--next to the negative\r\npole--_cathode_ (_kata_, downward). He names _electrolyte_ (_luo_, to\r\nset free) the fluid decomposed directly by electricity passing through\r\nit; the term _electrolyzed_ meaning electro-chemically decomposed.\r\nThe elements of an _electrolyte_ are named _ions_ (_ion_, going), the\r\n_anion_ being the body (in sulphate of copper solution, the acid) which\r\n_goes up_ to the positive pole, to the _anode_ of the decomposing\r\nbody, whilst the _cation_ is that (in sulphate of copper solution, the\r\nmetal) which _goes down_ to the negative pole, to the _cathode_ of the\r\ndecomposing body.\r\n\r\nThe many tests which he made with his voltameter led him to\r\nthe conclusion “that under every variety of circumstance, the\r\ndecompositions of the voltaic current are as definite in their\r\ncharacter as those chemical combinations which gave birth to the\r\natomic theory” (_Phil. Trans._ for 1833, p. 675; for 1834, p. 77;\r\nPoggendorff, _Annalen_, Vols. XXXII. p. 401; XXXIII. pp. 301, 433,\r\n481; Bakewell, “Electric Science,” p. 124; “Brit. Assoc. Report” for\r\n1833, p. 393; Henry’s “Memoirs of Dalton,” p. 106).\r\n\r\nThe eighth series of his “Researches” (Vol. I. pars. 875, etc.) treats\r\nof the “electricity of the voltaic pile,” a further investigation\r\nof which is shown through the papers constituting his sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth series as per Index of Vol. II. p. 302. Faraday establishes\r\nby very simple experiments the most powerful known refutation of\r\nVolta’s contact theory and shows conclusively that the current in the\r\npile results from the mutual chemical action of its elements, just\r\nas Fabbroni and Wollaston had stated before him. An extract from the\r\nconclusion of his very elaborate defence of the chemical theory reads\r\nas follows: “... the contact theory assumes, that a force which is\r\nable to overcome powerful resistance ... can arise out of nothing:\r\nthat, without any change in the acting matter, or the consumption of\r\nany generating force, a current can be produced, which shall go on\r\nfor ever against a constant resistance, or only be stopped as in the\r\nvoltaic trough, by the ruins which its exertion has heaped upon its own\r\ncourse.... The chemical theory sets out with a power, the existence of\r\nwhich is pre-proved, and then follows its variations, rarely assuming\r\nanything which is not supported by some corresponding simple chemical\r\nfact. The contact theory sets out with an assumption to which it adds\r\nothers, as the cases require, until at last the contact force, instead\r\nof being the firm unchangeable thing at first supposed by Volta, is as\r\nvariable as chemical force itself. Were it otherwise than it is, and\r\nwere the contact theory true, the equality of cause and effect must\r\nbe denied. Then would perpetual motion also be true; and it would not\r\nbe at all difficult, upon the first given case of an electric current\r\nby contact alone, to produce an electro-magnetic arrangement, which,\r\nas to its principle, would go on producing mechanical effects for\r\never” (“Exp. Res.,” pars. 2071–2073, Vol. II. pp. 103–104; _Phil.\r\nTrans._ for 1834, p. 425; for 1840, pp. 61, 93; Poggendorff,\r\n_Annalen_, Vols.

Researches,” Vol. I. pp. 322–323--induction of\r\ngalvanic current upon itself).\r\n\r\nFaraday’s theory of induction offers nothing new as to the nature\r\nof the electric forces--it simply indicates the manner of their\r\ndistribution and the laws by which they are affected. His experiments\r\nshow that electrization by influence is possible only by means\r\nof continuous particles of air or other non-conducting medium\r\n(dielectric), that no electric action occurs at a distance greater than\r\nthe interval existing between two adjacent molecules of such medium, in\r\nwhich latter a true polarization of the particles takes place, and that\r\nit is by means of this polarization that electric force is transferred\r\nto a distance. Induction only takes place through insulators: induction\r\nis insulation, it being the action of a charged body upon insulating\r\nmatter, of which latter the particles communicate to each other in a\r\nvery minute degree the electric forces whereby they become polarized\r\nand are enabled to transmit an equal amount of the opposite force to\r\na distance. The latter property is termed _inductive force_ or\r\n_specific inductive capacity_, and Faraday discovered that the\r\nintensity of electric induction varies in different insulating media;\r\nfor instance, the induction through shell-lac (the first substance he\r\nexperimented with) being twice as great as through a like thickness of\r\nair. It was while experimenting with shell-lac that he first observed\r\nthe singular phenomenon of the _return_ or _residual charge_,\r\ni. e. the charge which would of itself gradually reappear in the\r\napparatus after the latter had been suddenly and perfectly discharged.\r\nThis, he considered due to the penetration, into the substance of the\r\ndielectric, of a portion of the charge by conduction. The inductive\r\ncapacity of all gases he found to be the same as that of air, and this\r\nproperty does not alter with variations in their density.\r\n\r\nHis discovery of the specific inductive capacity of various substances\r\nhas been already alluded to (A.D. 1772, Cavendish). Faraday’s\r\nbiographer in the ninth “Britannica” says: “It appears, from hitherto\r\nunpublished papers, that Henry Cavendish had, before 1773, not only\r\ndiscovered that glass, wax, rosin and shell-lac have higher specific\r\ninductive capacities than air but had actually determined the numerical\r\nratios of these capacities. This, of course, was not known to Faraday\r\nor other electricians of his time.” It was on the 30th of November,\r\n1837, Faraday communicated to the Royal Society the paper on Induction\r\nwherein he announces the re-discovery of _specific inductive capacity_.\r\nOne of its most important results to-day, remarks John Tyndall, “is\r\nthe establishment of the specific inductive capacity of insulators--a\r\nsubject of supreme importance in connection with submarine cables.\r\nAs a striking illustration of Faraday’s insight, it may be mentioned\r\nthat as early as 1838 he had virtually foreseen and predicted the\r\nretardation produced by the inductive action between the wires of\r\nsubmarine cables and the surrounding sea-water” (Tyndall’s “Notes on\r\nElectricity,” 1871, pp. 160–161; “Exper. Researches,” Index Vol. I.;\r\n“Faraday as a Discoverer,” new edition, p. 89). Consult, also, the\r\nreferences entered at Cavendish, A.D. 1772; J. E. H.

Researches” (Vol. II. pars.\r\n1749–1795), Faraday gives the results of his experiments proving the\r\nidentity of the power of the _gymnotus_ or the _torpedo_ with common\r\nelectricity. He concludes that “a single medium discharge of the fish\r\nis at least equal to the electricity of a Leyden battery of fifteen\r\njars, containing 3500 square inches of glass coated on both sides,\r\ncharged to its highest degree” (p. 8); “all the water and all the\r\nconducting matter around the fish, through which a discharge circuit\r\ncan in any way be completed, is filled at the moment with circulating\r\nelectric power and this state might be easily represented generally\r\nin a diagram by drawing the lines of inductive action upon it. In the\r\ncase of a _gymnotus_ surrounded equally in all directions by water,\r\nthese would resemble generally in disposition the magnetic curves of\r\na magnet having the same straight or curved shape as the animal, that\r\nis, provided he in such cases employed, as may be expected, his four\r\nelectric organs at once” (p. 12) (C. Matteucci, “Traité des phénom.\r\n...” Paris, 1844, pp. 188–192).\r\n\r\nThen follow in due course, Faraday’s remarkable papers relating to\r\nthe magnetization of light and the illumination of magnetic lines of\r\nforce, the polar and other condition of diamagnetic bodies, etc. These\r\ncommunications, which he made to the Royal Society in November and\r\nDecember 1845, contain the particulars of what many consider to be his\r\nmost brilliant discoveries. He first shows that when a ray of polarized\r\nlight passes through a piece of silicated borate of lead glass placed\r\nbetween the poles of a natural (or preferably an electro-) magnet, so\r\nthat the line of magnetic force shall pass through its length, the\r\npolarized ray will experience a rotation. The law is thus expressed:\r\n“If a magnetic line of force be _going_ from a North pole or coming\r\nfrom a South pole, along the path of a polarized ray, _coming_ to the\r\nobserver, it will rotate that ray to the right hand, or if such a line\r\nof force be coming from a North pole or going from a South pole it\r\nwill rotate such a ray to the left hand” (_Phil. Trans._ for 1846 and\r\n1856; Poggendorff, _Annalen_, Vol. C. pp. 111, 439; Noad, “Manual,”\r\npp. 804–805; Harris, “Rud. Mag.,” Parts I and II. p. 71; Whewell,\r\n“Hist. of the Inductive Sciences,” Vol. II. pp. III, 133; Gmelin’s\r\n“Chemistry,” Vol. I. pp. 168–169). At the Faraday Centenary Celebration\r\nheld in London, June 18, 1891, Lord Rayleigh observed that “the full\r\nsignificance of the last-named discovery was not yet realized. A large\r\nstep towards realizing it, however, was contained in the observation\r\nof Sir William Thomson, that the rotation of the plane of polarization\r\nproved that something in the nature of rotation must be going on within\r\nthe medium when subjected to the magnetizing force, but the precise\r\nnature of the rotation was a matter for further speculation, and\r\nperhaps might not be known for some time to come.”\r\n\r\nThrough Faraday’s other communication, is made known the discovery\r\nof _diamagnetism_. Therein he shows, as the result of his customary\r\ncareful experimental explorations that the magnetism of every known\r\nsubstance (even tissues of the human frame) is manifested in one of\r\ntwo ways. Either the body is, like iron, attracted by the magnet,\r\ntaking a position coincident with the magnetic forces which he calls\r\n_paramagnetic_ (_para_ beside or near, _magnetes_, _magnes_, magnet)\r\nor bodies--like bismuth, for instance--are repelled by the poles\r\nand should therefore be called _diamagnetic_ (_dia_, across) for\r\nthey set themselves across, equatorially, or at right angles to the\r\nmagnetic lines. As far back as 1788, the repulsion by bismuth was\r\nfirst observed by Brugmans, while M. Becquerel, during 1827, confirmed\r\nthe observation, said to have been made by Coulomb, that a needle of\r\nwood could be made to point across the magnetic curves, and stated\r\nthat he had found such a needle place itself parallel to the wires\r\nof a galvanometer. Yet, neither M. Becquerel nor M. Lebaillif, who\r\n(after Saigy and Seebeck) had called attention to the repulsion of\r\nboth bismuth and antimony by the magnet, made a distinction of the\r\ndiamagnetic force from the paramagnetic as Faraday did. Amongst other\r\nresults, this English scientist found that phosphorus is at the head\r\nof all diamagnetic substances, bismuth taking the lead amongst the\r\nmetals, whilst, of many gases and vapours, oxygen proved to be the\r\nleast diamagnetic, in fact, the only one which is paramagnetic (“Lond.,\r\nEdin., and Dub. Phil. Mag.” for December 1850). All the facts set\r\nforth in Mr. Faraday’s paper are, according to Brande, resolvable\r\nby induction into the general law; that while every particle of a\r\nmagnetic body is attracted, every particle of a diamagnetic body is\r\nrepelled by either pole of a magnet: these forces continue as long as\r\nthe magnetic power is sustained, and cease on the cessation of that\r\npower, standing therefore in the same general antithetical relation to\r\neach other as the positive and negative conditions of electricity, the\r\nnorthern and southern polarities of ordinary magnetism, or the lines\r\nof electric and magnetic force in magneto-electricity.

Having suspended four bars of the metal horizontally\r\nbetween the poles of the electro-magnet, the first pointed _axially_;\r\nthe second _equatorially_; another _equatorial_ in one position,\r\nand _obliquely equatorial_ if turned round on its axis fifty or\r\nsixty degrees; the fourth _equatorially and axially_ under the same\r\ntreatment; whilst all of them were repelled by a single magnetic pole,\r\nthus showing their strong and well-marked diamagnetic character. These\r\nvariations were attributed to the regularly crystalline condition\r\nof the bars. He then chose carefully selected crystals and, after\r\ndescribing their peculiar action between the poles, he says that\r\n“the results are altogether very different from those produced by\r\ndiamagnetic action. They are equally distinct from those dependent on\r\nordinary magnetic action. They are also distinct from those discovered\r\nand described by Plücker, in his beautiful researches into the\r\nrelation of the optic axis to magnetic action; for there the force is\r\nequatorial, whereas here it is axial. So they appear to present to us\r\na new force, or a new form of force in the molecules of matter, which,\r\nfor convenience’ sake, I will conventionally designate by a new word,\r\nas the _magne-crystallic force_.” Prof. A. M. Mayer justly observes\r\n(“Johnson’s Cycl.,” I. 1342) that the above-named facts “received their\r\nfull explanation at the hands of Tyndall, whose subtile examination or\r\nlucid explanation of these phenomena--though not popularly known--we\r\nthink form his greatest claim to illustrious distinction as a man\r\nof science.” For an extract from the last-named work relative to M.\r\nPoisson’s remarkable theoretic prediction of magne-crystallic action,\r\nsee the article concerning that scientist at A.D. 1811.

Papers of the Royal Society.” Among those may be singled out\r\nhis additional investigations regarding the magnetism of gases and\r\nthe magnetic relations of flames and gases, the lines of magnetic\r\nforce, subterraneous electro-telegraphic wires (_Phil. Mag._ s. 4,\r\nVol. VII. 1854), the relation of gravity to electricity, atmospheric\r\nmagnetism, likewise his recorded observations on hydro-electricity,\r\nmagneto-electric light for lighthouses, pyro-electricity, the\r\nelectrophorus, Wheatstone’s telegraph, etc. (“Roy. Inst. Proc.” for\r\n1854–1858, pp. 555–560). It was in 1848 he wrote of the powerful\r\ninsulating properties of gutta-percha (Gmelin’s “Chemistry,” Vol. I. p.\r\n313; “Lond. and Edin. Phil. Mag.,” Vol. XXXII. p. 165), and he not long\r\nafter constructed a very singular apparatus to a Leyden jar consisting\r\nof a wire 140 miles long, perfectly insulated with gutta-percha, one\r\nend of which communicated with an insulated pile of 360 elements of\r\nzinc and copper charged with acidulated water, as described in the\r\n“Britannica.” The results of his inquiries concerning the Leyden\r\njar charge of buried electric conducting wires were, according to\r\nWhitehouse’s pamphlet on the Atl. Tel. (p. 5) communicated to the Roy.\r\nInst. during the year 1854.\r\n\r\nThe life of Michael Faraday is an admirable example of extraordinary\r\nsuccesses achieved through patient endeavour and constancy of purpose\r\nover unusual obstacles of birth and education. M. Dumas, in the\r\nsixteenth volume of the London “Chemical News,” tells us he was the\r\nonly man in England who raised himself to the first rank in science,\r\nwhose every attribute can be fearlessly held up as a model. He had\r\nnone of the “ambition, eternal pining after rank or hauteur” of\r\nDavy, nor “the secretiveness and coldness” of Wollaston. “Faraday’s\r\nintellect, while it burnt as brightly as Davy’s, was as deep searching\r\nas Wollaston’s, and as reverent as Newton’s, yet it had nothing in\r\nit which could repel us, chill us, or forbid our affection.” The son\r\nof a blacksmith, he was first placed in a bookseller’s shop, then\r\napprenticed to a bookbinder, but his tastes were averse to the trade\r\nand he was led to seek instruction in another line, more particularly\r\nafter attending the evening lectures of Mr. Tatum, yet, as already\r\nstated (see Dr. George Gregory, A.D. 1796), it was while in\r\nM. Riebau’s (the bookbinder’s) employ that chance threw in his way the\r\nworks which led him to enter the channels in which he subsequently\r\nbecame so distinguished. To a friend, he writes:\r\n\r\n“Your subject interested me deeply every way; for Mrs. Marcet was a\r\ngood friend to me, as she must have been to many of the human race. I\r\nentered the shop of a bookseller and bookbinder at the age of thirteen,\r\nin the year 1804, remaining there eight years, and during the chief\r\npart of the time bound books. Now it was in those books, in the hours\r\nafter work, that I found the beginning of my philosophy. There were\r\ntwo that especially helped me, the ‘Encyclopædia Britannica,’ from\r\nwhich I gained my first notions of electricity, and Mrs. Marcet’s\r\n‘Conversations on Chemistry,’ which gave me my foundation in that\r\nscience. Do not suppose that I was a very deep thinker, or was marked\r\nas a precocious person ... but facts were important to me and saved\r\nme. I could trust a fact and always cross-examined an assertion. So\r\nwhen I questioned Mrs. Marcet’s book by such little experiments as I\r\ncould find means to perform, and found it true to the facts as I could\r\nunderstand them, I felt that I had got hold of an anchor in chemical\r\nknowledge, and clung fast to it....” (“Faraday as a Discoverer,” by\r\nJohn Tyndall, 1868, pp. 6–7).\r\n\r\nThink of the startling, not to say marvellous, achievements growing out\r\nof Faraday’s subsequent first experiments with an electrical machine\r\nmade out of an old bottle and by the aid of a Leyden jar constructed\r\nwith a medicine phial!\r\n\r\nIn 1812, he was taken by Mr. Dance to the lectures of Sir Humphry\r\nDavy, whose chemical assistant he became the following year and in\r\nwhose company, as we have already seen (A.D. 1801), he travelled on\r\nthe Continent until 1815. Mr. Davies Gilbert, to whom is due Davy’s\r\nintroduction to the Royal Institution, has said of the last-named\r\nillustrious philosopher that the greatest of all his discoveries was\r\nthe discovery of Faraday. In 1816, Michael Faraday was placed by Mr.\r\nBrande in charge of the “Quarterly Journal of Science,” and, during\r\n1823, he was elected corresponding Member of the French Academy,\r\nbecoming F.R.S. the ensuing year through the influence of his friend\r\nRichard Phillips. It was during 1825–1826 he published in the _Phil.\r\nTrans._ the chemical papers wherein he announces the discovery of\r\nbenzole (called by him bicarburet of hydrogen) to which, says Hoffmann,\r\n“we virtually owe our supply of aniline, with all its magnificent\r\nprogeny of colours.” In 1827, Faraday succeeded Davy as lecturer at\r\nthe Royal Institution, and, from 1829 to 1842, he occupied the post\r\nof chemical lecturer at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. The\r\n“Experimental Researches,” to which we have so often alluded, first\r\nappeared in the 1831 _Phil. Trans._, and were afterwards collected\r\nin three volumes, which were published respectively during 1839, 1844,\r\n1855. Faraday was made D.C.L. in 1832 by Oxford University, and, one\r\nyear later, he received the Fullerian professorship of chemistry in the\r\nRoyal Institution, which he held till his death. A pension was given\r\nhim by the English Government in 1835, and he also received the Royal\r\nMedal, which latter was again conferred upon him, together with the\r\nRumford Medal, during 1846. Ten years before (1836) he had become a\r\nmember of the Senate of the London University, and during the year 1858\r\nthe Queen allotted him the residence in Hampton Court where he died in\r\n1867. “Taking him for all in all,” says Tyndall, “it will, I think,\r\nbe conceded that Faraday was the greatest experimental philosopher\r\nthat the world has ever seen; and I would hazard the opinion that the\r\nprogress of future research will tend not to diminish but to enhance\r\nthe labours of this mighty explorer.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Life of Faraday,” by Dr. H.

A\r\nvery good analysis of Anaxagoras’ philosophical opinions is to be found\r\nin the “Biographical Dictionary of the Society of Useful Knowledge.”\r\nGilbert alludes to him (_De Magnete_, Book II. chap. iii. and Book\r\nV. chap. xiii.) as believing that the loadstone was endowed with a sort\r\nof life, because it possessed the power of moving and attracting iron,\r\nand as declaring in fact that the entire world is endowed with a soul.\r\n\r\nAnaxagoras is accused, by Pliny and other early writers, of having\r\npredicted the fall of aerolites from the sun, and of regarding all\r\nbodies in the universe “as fragments of rocks, which the fiery ether,\r\nin the force of its gyratory motion, has torn from the earth and\r\nconverted into stars” (Humboldt, “Cosmos” 1859–1860, Vol. I. pp.\r\n133–135, note; Vol. II. p. 309; Vol. III. pp. 11–12; Vol. IV. pp.\r\n206–207).\r\n\r\nAristotle also attacks Anaxagoras for not properly etymologizing the\r\nword _aether_, from αιθεἲν, to burn, and on this account using it for\r\nfire. He shows that _aether_, which signifies to run perpetually,\r\nimplies that a perpetual motion and perpetuity of subsistence belongs\r\nto the heavenly bodies (“Treatises of Aristotle,” by Thos. Taylor,\r\nLondon, 1807, p. 43, note).\r\n\r\nAccording to Anaximenes, named above (born at Miletus about 528\r\nB.C.), the primal principle was Aer, of which all things are\r\nformed and into which all things are resolved. He belonged to the\r\nbranch called the dynamical, whose doctrines as to the heavenly bodies\r\nwere opposed to those of mechanical philosophers such as Anaxagoras,\r\nEmpedocles and Anaximander of Miletus (“Engl.

He is\r\nwell worthy the profound respect and high admiration in which he is\r\nheld always by Gilbert, who alludes to him in Book I. chap. i. and\r\nin Book II. chap. iii. of his _De Magnete_. The chief work of St.\r\nThomas Aquinas is the “Summa Theologiæ,” to which he devoted the last\r\nnine years of his life and which by many has been called the supreme\r\nmonument of the thirteenth century. The first part of the “Summa\r\nTheologiæ” is said to have been originally published in 1465 and the\r\nsecond part in 1471, the completed work first appearing during the year\r\n1485.[62]\r\n\r\nOne of his critics remarks that those wishing to thoroughly comprehend\r\nthe peculiar character of metaphysical thought in the Middle Ages\r\nshould study Aquinas, in whose writings it is seen with the greatest\r\nconsistency. He is thus spoken of in Dr. Wm. Turner’s “History of\r\nPhilosophy,” published by Ginn & Co., 1903: “He had a comprehensiveness\r\nof purpose which, in these modern times, seems nothing short of\r\nstupendous. It is only when, as we study the history of later\r\nscholasticism and the history of the philosophy of modern times, we\r\nshall look back to the thirteenth century through the perspective of\r\nages of less successful attempts at philosophical synthesis, that we\r\nshall begin to realize the true grandeur of the most commanding figure\r\nin the history of mediæval thought.”\r\n\r\nAquinas died at the Cistercian Monastery in 1274, and was canonized\r\nforty-nine years later by Pope John XXII.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Carle (P.

In this way, there is found\r\na certain composite movement, resulting from the attraction, the\r\nspontaneous motion and the impulsion; which composite motion, however,\r\nis rightly to be referred to attraction, because the beginning of this\r\nmotion is invariably from one term, and its end is there too; and that\r\nis precisely the distinguishing character of attraction.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Eloy (N.

But Stadius, holding the directly opposite opinion,\r\nproves by observations, that the latitudes have grown less. ‘The\r\nlatitude of Rome,’ says he, ‘is given in the _Geographia_ of Ptolemy\r\nas 41⅔°; and lest any one should say that some error has crept into\r\nthe text of Ptolemy, Pliny relates, and Vitruvius in his ninth book\r\ntestifies, that at Rome on the day of the equinox the ninth part of\r\nthe gnomon’s shadow is lacking.

Aphr. (Quæst.

He was considered, by far, the most learned\r\nthinker of his age, and, according to Carl Snyder, who dedicates “The\r\nWorld Machine,” 1907, to Democritus, he was justly esteemed by Bacon as\r\nthe mightiest of the ancients, for he wrote illuminatively upon almost\r\nevery branch of natural knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe following note to “The Atomistic Philosophy” appears at p. 230,\r\nVol. II of Dr. E. Zeller’s “History of Greek Philosophy,” translation\r\nof S. F. Alleyne, London, 1881:\r\n\r\n“Leucippus and Democritus derive all action and suffering from contact.\r\nOne thing suffers from another, if parts of the latter penetrate the\r\nempty interspaces of the former.... Democritus thought that the magnet\r\nand the iron consist of atoms of similar nature but which are less\r\nclosely packed together in the magnet. As, on the one hand, like draws\r\nlike, and, on the other, all moves in the Void, the emanations of the\r\nmagnet penetrate the iron, and pass out a part of its atoms, which,\r\non their side, strain towards the magnet, and penetrate its empty\r\ninterspaces. The iron itself follows this movement, while the magnet\r\ndoes not move towards the iron, because the iron has fewer spaces for\r\nreceiving the effluences.”\r\n\r\nThe attraction of the magnet, as explained by Diogenes of Appollonia,\r\nis thus given by Alex. Aphr. (Quæst. Nat., II. 23, p. 138, Speng):\r\n“Empedocles supposed that, after the emanations of the magnet have\r\npenetrated into the pores of the iron, and the air which choked them\r\nhas been expelled, powerful emanations from the iron pass into the\r\nsymmetrical pores of the magnet, which draw the iron to itself and hold\r\nit fast.”\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the Atomic Doctrine of Leucippus and Democritus\r\nwas opposed to the Homoiomeria of Anaxagoras of Clazomenæ--the last\r\ngreat philosopher of the Ionian School.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Ueberweg (Fr.), “History of Philosophy,” trans.\r\n   of G.

His singular precocity attracted\r\nJoseph J. Scaliger, who undertook to direct his studies at the Leyden\r\nUniversity, where it is said he achieved brilliant success in all\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\nOne of his biographers remarks that, in the annals of precocious\r\ngenius, there is no greater prodigy on record than Hugo Grotius, who\r\nwas able to write good Latin verses at nine (1592), was ripe for\r\nthe University at twelve (1595), and at the age of fifteen (1598),\r\nedited the Encyclopædic work of Martianus Capella--a writer of the\r\nfifth century--with the aid of his father, Jan de Groot, the Delft\r\nburgomaster. It might be added that, in 1597, he had delivered public\r\ndiscourses on mathematics, philosophy and jurisprudence; in 1598, he\r\nwas so highly sought for everywhere, that he was asked to, and did,\r\naccompany Count Justin of Nassau and Olden Barneveldt on their special\r\nembassy to the French Court, and that, in 1599, he not only took his\r\ndegree of doctor of law and pleaded his first cases before the Hague\r\nCourts, but was able, through his superior knowledge of mathematics, to\r\ntranslate into Latin Simon Stevin’s work on navigation. Later on, 1603,\r\nhe was appointed historiographer of the United Provinces, becoming\r\nfiscal general in 1607 (also Council Pensionary at Rotterdam six years\r\nlater), and during 1609, he published his first work “De Mare Liberum,”\r\nwhich was a treatise against the claims of the English to exclusive\r\nright over certain seas. This was followed in 1610 by “De Antiq.\r\nReipub. Batavæ,” and some years afterwards by his chief work, “De Jure\r\nBelli et Pacis,” considered the basis of international law and freely\r\ntranslated into all the principal languages.

He was the\r\nactual originator of astronomical tables amongst the Greeks and, in\r\nthe new map of the world which he constructed and founded upon that\r\nof Eratosthenes, the geographical degrees of latitude and longitude\r\nwere based on lunar observations, and on the measurement of shadows,\r\nwherever such an application of astronomy was admissible (“Cosmos,”\r\nLondon, 1849, Vol. II. p. 545; Ideler, “Handbuch der Chronologie,” Vol.\r\nI. ss. 212, 329).\r\n\r\nThe mathematician Eratosthenes, alluded to above, was a native\r\nof Cyrene, and pronounced the most celebrated of the Alexandrian\r\nlibrarians. He is reported to have made the earliest attempt at\r\nmeasurement of an arc of the meridian. The next measurement of record\r\nis that of the astronomers of Almamon in the plains of Mesopotamia\r\n(“Encycl. Brit.,” ninth edition, Edinburgh, 1876, Vol. X. p. 177). The\r\nfirst arc of the meridian measured in modern times with an accuracy any\r\nway corresponding to the difficulty of the problem was by Snellius,\r\nwho has given an account of it in his most remarkable work called\r\n“Eratosthenes Batavus,” published at Leyden in 1617 (“Ency.

Hart Milman, London, 1840, Vol.\r\nII. p. 384), and became a very extensive writer. Dufresnoy enumerates\r\nas many as eighty-six editions of his entire works, besides separate\r\npublications of his different treatises, appearing between the years\r\n1461–1465 and 1739; the best editions being given in Vols. X-XI of\r\nthe “Bibliotheca Patrum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum ...” by Gersdorf\r\n(Ephraim Gotthelf), Leipzig, 1842–1844 and in Migne (Jacques Paul)\r\n“Patrologiæ,” Vols. VI-VII, 1844. His principal work is the “Divinarum\r\nInstitutionum,” the third book of which (“De falsa sapientia”) is\r\nreferred to by Gilbert (_De Magnete_, Chap. III), when he says\r\nthat Lactantius, like the most unlearned of the vulgar, or like an\r\nuncultured bumpkin, treats with ridicule the mention of antipodes and\r\nof a round globe of earth.\r\n\r\nGeo. Hakewill, who has already appeared in this “Bibliographical\r\nHistory,” at A.D. 1627, alludes to the above (“Apologie,” Oxford,\r\n1635, lib. iii. p. 281), in manner following: “Yet that which to me\r\nseemeth more strange is that those two learned Clearkes, Lactantius\r\n(_Divin. Inst._, lib. iii. cap. 24), and Augustine (_De Civitate Dei_,\r\nI. lib. xvi. cap. 9), should with that earnestnesse deny the being\r\nof any antipodes.... Zachary, Bishop of Rome, and Boniface, Bishop\r\nof Mentz, led (as it seems), by the authority of these Fathers, went\r\nfarther herein, condemning one Vergilius, a Bishop of Saltzburg, as\r\nan heretique, only for holding that there were antipodes.” Madame\r\nBlavatsky (“Isis Unveiled,” Vol. I. p. 526) says: “In 317 A.D. we find\r\nLactantius teaching his pupil Crispus Cæsar, that the earth is a plane\r\nsurrounded by the sky, which is composed of fire and water, and warning\r\nhim against the heretical doctrine of the earth’s globular form!”\r\n\r\nThe following notes concerning the antipodes are likely to prove\r\ninteresting:\r\n\r\n“Pythagoras left no writings--Aristotle speaks only of his school--but\r\nDiogenes Laertius in one passage (‘Vitæ,’ VIII. I. Pythag. 25), quotes\r\nan authority to the effect that Pythagoras asserted the earth to be\r\nspherical and inhabited all over, so that there were antipodes, to whom\r\nthat is _over_ which to us is _under_.... Plato makes Socrates say that\r\nhe took up the work of Anaxagoras, hoping to learn whether the earth\r\nwas round or flat (‘Phædo,’ 46, Stallb.

Mention thereof is to be\r\nfound in the “Trésor” of Brunetto Latini, in the “Divina Commedia,” in\r\nthe “Convito” (Dante, Opere Minori, Vol. I. p. 93), and in the “Acerba”\r\nof Francesco degli Stabili (Cecco d’Ascoli), at ff. 8–11, lib. i.\r\ncap. 3; as well as in most cosmographical treatises of the fourteenth\r\ncentury (Libri, Vol. II. p. 197, note).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Cecco D’Ascoli.

It was the standard\r\nup to the time of the marine discoveries of the fifteenth century, and\r\nhas been translated and published into editions too numerous to mention\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the “Geographia Universalis” issue of 1540 is the\r\nfirst to embrace a proper map bearing the name “America,” and that,\r\nto the identical account of Columbus which originally appeared in\r\nthe 1522 and 1525 editions, Servetus appended a few words concerning\r\nthe absurdity of putting the claims of Americus Vespuccius before\r\nthose of the real discoverer.[69] The first book in which the name\r\nAmerica was formally given to the new Continent is entitled “Globus\r\nMundi,” published 1507–1510, and attributed to Henricus Loritus--de\r\nGlaris--Glareanus. The suggestion of the name had, indeed, been made by\r\nthe geographer Waldseemüller (Martinus Hylacomylus) of Freiburg, in his\r\n“Cosmographiæ Introductio,” published at St. Dié, in Lorraine, April\r\n25, 1507, but the “Globus Mundi” was first to put it into effect.\r\n\r\nThe Waldseemüller suggestion above alluded to is thus translated: “And\r\nthe fourth part of the world, having been discovered by Americus, it\r\nmay be called Amerige; that is, the land of Americus, or America.” In\r\n1901, Prof. Jos. Fischer, of Beldkirch, discovered, at Wolfegg Castle\r\nin Würtemberg, two huge maps, measuring together eight feet by four\r\nand a half feet, which proved to be those of Waldseemüller, of which\r\nall trace had been lost for centuries. They were reproduced in London,\r\nduring the year 1903, and were thus alluded to by one of the writers at\r\nthe time:\r\n\r\n“Ever since Humboldt first called attention to the ‘Cosmographiæ\r\nIntroductio’ no lost maps have ever been sought for so diligently as\r\nthose of Waldseemüller. It is not too much to say that the honour of\r\nbeing their lucky discoverer has long been considered as the highest\r\npossible prize to be obtained amongst students in the field of ancient\r\ncartography. But until the summer of 1901, although many copies of the\r\nbook are known in various editions, no specimen of either the globe or\r\nmap has ever been seen or heard of in modern times. Some historians\r\nand geographers have even gone so far as to state definitely that they\r\nwere never issued at all, and the book published alone. Others have\r\nheld that they never got beyond their manuscript form, while some\r\nhave contended that they were actually issued with the book, but,\r\nbeing separate, had become lost in the course of time. The writers\r\nholding this last view have been brought to their belief by tracing the\r\nsupposed influence of the St. Dié cartography in later maps, and these\r\nauthorities have been proved to be right by Prof. Fischer’s discovery.\r\nThe expectation that the missing map would be found to bear the name\r\nof AMERICA on the newly discovered Western Lands has also been duly\r\nrealized.”\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Le nom d’Amérique et les grandes mappemondes\r\n   ... de 1507 et 1516,” in “Annales de Géographie,” 15 Janvier\r\n   1904, pp. 29–36; “History of North America,” by Alfred Brittin,\r\n   Philadelphia, 1903, at p. 293, Vol. I of which is a fine\r\n   reproduction of a sheet from Waldseemüller’s “Cosmographiæ\r\n   Introductio” published in May 1507, showing the passage that\r\n   first suggested calling the new world by the name of America;\r\n   “Martinus Hylacomylus Waltzemüller, ses ouvrages et ses\r\n   collaborateurs, par un géographe bibliophile” (M. d’Avezac),\r\n   Paris, 1867; “Geographical Journal,” Vol. XIX. pp. 201–209,\r\n   389; Humboldt, “Examen Critique,” Paris, 1836, Vol. I. p. 22;\r\n   also Vol. IV and Vol. V _passim_; “Amerigo Vespucci,” Vol. II.\r\n   pp. 129–179 of Justin Winsor’s “Narrative and Critical History\r\n   of America,” Boston, 1889.

To Puteanus, Gilbert alludes (_De Magnete_, Book I. chap.\r\ni. and Book II. chap. iii.) saying that he discusses the loadstone\r\nbriefly and crudely and deduces its power, not from a property of its\r\nwhole substance unknown to any one and incapable of demonstration\r\n(as Galen held and, after him, nearly all physicians), but from “its\r\nsubstantial form as from a prime motor and self-motor, and as from its\r\nown most potent nature and its natural temperament, as the instrument\r\nwhich the efficient form of its substance, or the second cause, which\r\nis without a medium, employs in its operations. So the loadstone\r\nattracts iron not without a physical cause, and for the sake of some\r\ngood.” But nothing like this, adds Gilbert, is done in other bodies by\r\nany substantial form unless it be the primary one, and this Puteanus\r\ndoes not recognize.\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--“Biographie Générale,” Vol. XV. p. 367; Larousse,\r\n   “Dict.

He settled\r\nfinally at Crotona in Lower Italy, during the year 529 B.C. and there\r\nestablished the school that has made him famous.\r\n\r\nTo a complete exposition of the Pythagorean school or sect, the\r\n“Biographie Générale” devotes, in Vol. XLI, twenty-four full columns,\r\nwhilst the notices of the Pythagoreans which Aristotle gives in the\r\nfirst book of the “Metaphysics” contain about all that is of importance\r\nin their theory.\r\n\r\nAccording to the report of Philolaus of Croton, the Pythagoreans taught\r\nthe progressive movement of the non-rotating Earth, its revolution\r\naround the focus of the world (the central fire, _hestia_), while Plato\r\nand Aristotle imagined that the Earth neither rotated nor advanced\r\nin space, but that, fixed to one central point, it merely oscillated\r\nfrom one side to the other. Humboldt, from whose “Cosmos” the above\r\nis taken, further says that the figurative and poetical myths of the\r\nPythagorean and Platonic pictures of the universe were as changeable\r\nas the fancy from which they emanated, and he cites Plato, who, in the\r\n_Phædrus_, adopts the system of Philolaus, whilst, in the _Timæus_,\r\nhe accepts the system according to which the earth is immovable in\r\nthe centre and which was subsequently called the Hipparchian or\r\nPtolemaic.[70]\r\n\r\n   REFERENCES.--Ueberweg (Dr. Friedrich), “History of Philosophy,”\r\n   tr. of Geo.

Beginning with the\r\nIonian School, on the right, before the statue of Minerva, the aged\r\nperson whose head is covered with linen, after the Egyptian manner is\r\nThales; whom Raphael has represented as walking with a Stick, because,\r\nwith that, he measured the Pyramids. Next to Thales is Archelaus of\r\nMessenia.... Behind them is Anaxagoras, resting his foot upon a marble\r\nbook and almost hidden; in reference to the persecutions he underwent.\r\nThe next figure, standing alone, at a little distance, to show that\r\nhe is of another School, represents Pythagoras; who seems resolved\r\nto continue fixed at one spot, to show the unchangeableness of his\r\nideas ... his head and body being turned different ways shows his\r\nmetaphorical method of teaching important truths; and the crown, formed\r\nby his hair, refers to his initiation in all mysteries. The Figure\r\nleaning on a column is Parmenides; close to whom sits a youth, his\r\nadopted son Zeno, who is writing something short; referring to a Poem,\r\nby Parmenides, which compared, in two hundred lines, all the various\r\nSystems of Philosophy. Two masters only of the Eleatic School are\r\nintroduced; because its followers were few in number. The metaphysics\r\nof Parmenides and Zeno gave rise to the Sceptical Philosophy of Pyrrho,\r\nexpressed by the next figure.... At the opposite side of the Picture,\r\ntalking with his fingers to a Figure in armour, supposed to represent\r\nAlcibiades, is Socrates ... who, like Thales, appears to be walking;\r\nbecause geometry was never taught in a fixed place.... Plato and\r\nAristotle are placed together on a flight of steps in the centre of the\r\nPicture: Plato, representative of the speculative school, holds the\r\nTimæus: his sublime style is expressed by his attitude, denoting that\r\nhis thoughts soar above this earth; and the cord attached to his neck\r\nmarks his initiation at the Eleusinian Mysteries.... Aristotle, founder\r\nof ethical and physical philosophy, points earthward. The Figure in\r\nshade, nearest to Plato, is Archothæa.... The next Figure, in the same\r\nline, indicates roughness of character, and represents Xenocrates....\r\nBehind Socrates and another Figure, Lasthenia, is a bearded old man\r\nZeno of Citium, the founder of the sect called Stoics.... Behind Zeno\r\nof Citium is Antisthenes, in shade, because his School is expressed\r\nby that of Zeno. On the side of Aristotle, the tallest and most\r\nconspicuous Figure is Theophrastus ... said to be the portrait of\r\nCardinal Bembo. The next figures are Strato of Lampsacus, Demetrius\r\nPhalereus, Callisthenes, Neophron, Glycon. Behind the last named is\r\nHeraclides and in rear of the disciples of Aristotle are Euclid of\r\nMegara and Eubulides of Miletus, his pupil: the last hated Aristotle,\r\nand is looking angrily at him. The lower part of the Picture, on\r\nthe side with the statue of Apollo, represents the Philosophy of\r\nLeucippus, the disciple of Zeno, though the author of a very opposite\r\nsystem. He first taught the doctrine of Atoms.... Democritus, his most\r\ncelebrated disciple, is sitting near him--booted, in the manner of his\r\ncountrymen, the Abderites--and writing upon a stone table, shaped like\r\nthe sarcophagi among which he used to meditate: he lost his fortune,\r\ntherefore his dress indicates poverty; and he is represented in deep\r\nmeditation, to show his uncommon studiousness. Opposite to Leucippus\r\nsits Empedocles, resting on a _cube_, though not with _contempt_,\r\naccording to the principles of Leucippus; because Empedocles adhered,\r\non some points, to the Pythagorean system. The youth holding, before\r\nEmpedocles, Pythagoras’s Table of the Generation of Numbers and the\r\nHarmonies, is Meton.... The Figure in an Oriental costume bending over\r\nPythagoras, represents Averrhoes, or one of the Magi, from which sect\r\nthe Grecian Schools derived part of their doctrines. Behind Empedocles,\r\nis Epicharmus.... The Figure in a toga is Lucretius, placed near\r\nEmpedocles, as having been his follower; but looking another way,\r\nbecause he differed from his master. This figure is the portrait of\r\nFrancesco, Duke of Urbino, nephew to Julius II. The person crowned with\r\nvine-leaves and resting a book on a pedestal, is Epicurus, looking gay,\r\naccording to the account given of him, and the Figure leaning upon his\r\nshoulder is Metrodorus; next to whom is Heraclitus, wearing a black\r\nveil, like that of the Ephesian Diana, in whose temple he exposed his\r\nworks. Seated on the second step, near the centre of the Picture, is\r\nDiogenes, and below him is a Portrait of the great architect, Bramante\r\n(under the character of Archimedes), who is tracing an hexagonal\r\nfigure on the pavement ... the enthusiastic-looking person who points\r\nto the hexagon, is supposed to be Archytas of Tarentum; the boy on\r\nhis knees, is Phenix of Alexandria; and behind him, with a hand on\r\nhis back, is Ctesibius. In the angle of the picture are Zoroaster and\r\nPtolemy, one holding a celestial and the other a terrestrial globe, as\r\nrepresentatives of Astronomy and Geometry; the figure wearing a crown,\r\nunder the character of Zoroaster, being Alphonso, King of Arragon,\r\nSicily and Naples; the person with a black turban on his head, and\r\nlikewise holding a Globe, may probably represent Confucius: and the two\r\npersons with whom Alphonso seems conversing are portraits of Raphael\r\nand of his master Pietro Perugino. The statues and _bassi-relievi_\r\nwith which Raphael has ornamented his scene, are emblematical of\r\nthe different Schools of Philosophy: and the picture, in point of\r\ncomposition, is considered to be his _chef-d’œuvre_, the Sibyls of S^a\r\nMaria della Pace excepted.\r\n\r\nA more detailed description of the above will be found in the works\r\nof Trendelenburg (Berlin, 1843), and of Richter (Heidelberg, 1882),\r\nbearing title “Ueber Rafael’s Schule von Athen.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX II\r\n\r\n          DISCOVERIES MADE BY WILLIAM GILBERT--DESIGNATED IN\r\n                 “DE MAGNETE” BY THE LARGER ASTERISKS\r\n\r\n       (_Alluded to in the Gilbert_ A.D. _1600 Article, p. 83_)\r\n\r\n\r\n   Book I. chap. iii.

The name\r\nof Mercator, it is said, was given to Kremer on account of the great\r\nusefulness of his reported invention to mercators or merchants.\r\n\r\nMercator’s earliest map was published in 1537. One year later appeared\r\nhis Map of the World (rediscovered during 1878 in New York), and, in\r\n1541, he introduced a terrestrial globe which was followed, ten years\r\nafterwards, by his equally well-known celestial globe. Then appeared,\r\nin 1568–1569, the first edition of his celebrated planisphere, intended\r\nfor use in navigation, which is the earliest known map on what is\r\ncalled “Mercator’s Projection,” and, in later years, he brought out\r\nmany other maps as well as geographical tables, etc., which are too\r\nnumerous to be specified here. [See article _Mercator_ in the\r\nBelgian “Biographie Nationale,” Vol. XIV, 1897, and consult likewise\r\n“L’œuvre géographique de Mercator” by Van Ostroy, “Meyers Konversations\r\nLexikon,” 1897, Vol. XII, pp. 153–154, also “La Nouvelle Biographie\r\nGénérale” de Mr. le Dr. Hœfer, Vol. XXV. p. 11.]\r\n\r\nThe original constructor of the chart known as “Mercator’s Projection”\r\nis, however, said to be a very able English mathematician, Edward\r\nWright (1560–1615) who is alluded to herein at pp. 78, 79, 520, 524,\r\n532. He was the designer of a very large sphere for Prince Henry, which\r\nshowed the motion of the planets, etc., and he predicted the eclipses\r\nfor a period of 17,100 years.\r\n\r\nSo much has been said herein regarding different well-known maps that\r\nthe following cannot but prove interesting. It is in apparently just\r\nclaim on behalf of Edward Wright to the above-named invention, and,\r\nas stated in the volume published during 1880 by John Davis for the\r\nHakluyt Society, the first Map of the World that was engraved in\r\nEngland on Wright’s (Mercator’s) projection is fully described by Mr.\r\nC. M. Coote in a Note at pp. 85–95 of the Davis “Voyages and Works.”\r\nThat map, he says, was published one year after Wright had explained\r\nthe principle of the projection in his “Certain Errors.” From Mr.\r\nCoote’s description, the following is extracted:\r\n\r\nWhat appears to have escaped the notice of Hallam, and those who have\r\nattempted to describe it at various times down to our day, is, that our\r\nmap is laid down upon the projection commonly known as Mercator’s. So\r\nlittle appears to be known as to the early history of this projection,\r\nthat as recently as April 16, 1878, it has been suggested by Mr. Elias\r\nF. Hall that charts upon this projection were not in general use among\r\nseamen at a period much earlier than 1630. Still more recently it has\r\nbeen gravely asserted that a distinguished Admiral of the American\r\nnavy only knew of it as the Merchant’s projection, and that he never\r\nknew that there was such a man as Mercator. In 1569 was produced at\r\nDuisbourg, Mercator’s well-known _Mappemonde_, and many years\r\nelapsed before it attracted the notice of other mapmakers. However\r\ninteresting it may be to us as a monument of geography, it is now\r\nadmitted that, as regards the projection, it is only approximately\r\ncorrect up to latitude 40. For the want of a demonstration of the true\r\nprinciples upon which such a projection was to be laid down, beyond the\r\nlegend on the _Mappemonde_, it found but few imitators. The only\r\nthree known to us are Bernardus Puteanus of Bruges in 1579, Cornelius\r\nde Jode in 1589, and Petrus Plancius in 1594. Of the first and third\r\nno examples of their maps on this projection are known to exist, these\r\ntwo doubtless had all the imperfections of the original Mercator. De\r\nJode’s “Speculum Orbis Terrarum” of 1589 is remarkable, as, while being\r\non the old plane projection with the lines of latitude and longitude\r\nequidistant, there is to be seen on it a feeble attempt to divide the\r\ncentral meridional line according to the idea of Mercator, one of\r\nthe best possible proofs how imperfectly this idea was understood by\r\nMercator’s own fellow-countrymen. About 1597 was published by Jodocus\r\nHondius in Amsterdam, a map entitled Typus Totius Orbis Terrarum, etc.,\r\neasily to be recognized by an allegorical figure, at the bottom of it,\r\nof a Christian soldier armed for the fight against all the powers of\r\nevil. This is on the true projection, known as Mercator’s, but which is\r\nreally that of Edward Wright. From Hondius’ connection with Mercator,\r\nand whose joint portraits from the frontispiece of the well-known Atlas\r\nof the latter, it might with good reason be supposed that Hondius\r\nacquired the art of projecting this map from Mercator, yet if one thing\r\nis more certain than another in the history of this projection, it is\r\nthe fact that Hondius did not acquire this art from Mercator or his\r\nmap, but from Edward Wright, the friend and colleague of Hakluyt.\r\n\r\nIn proof of this, the following evidence is adduced. We learn from\r\nBlundeville that, at some previous period, probably as early as 1592,\r\nWright sent his friend, the author, “a table to drawe thereby the\r\nparallells in the Mariner’s Carde, together with the vse thereof in\r\ntrewer sort, with a draught” or diagram of the projection. These, it\r\nis evident, were extracts from Wright’s “Errors in Navigation,” then\r\nin MS. Wright, in his preface to the reader, in his work when printed,\r\nbitterly complains that he was induced to lend MS. to Hondius, who,\r\nwith its aid and without Wright’s consent, prepared and published\r\nseveral “mappes of the World, which maps had been vnhatched, had not\r\nhe [Hondius] learned the right way to lay the groundwork of some of\r\nthem out of his book.” That the above Typus is one of the printed maps\r\ncomplained of, seems to be proved by the allusion to Wright to be found\r\non it.\r\n\r\nThe strongest evidence against the theory of Hondius having acquired\r\nthis art from Mercator, is the fact that in none of the subsequent\r\neditions of Mercator’s Atlases edited by him is there a map on this\r\nprojection to be found. The truth is, that to Wright, and not to\r\nMercator, is due the honour of being the first to demonstrate the true\r\nprinciples upon which such maps were to be laid down by means of the\r\nnow well-known Tables of meridional parts.\r\n\r\nThe first legitimate attempt to lay down a map upon the really true\r\nprojection, is no other than the original of our map. Before proceeding\r\nto point out some of its remaining points of interest, it will be\r\nconvenient here to endeavour to remove one or two misapprehensions\r\nrespecting it, which are even now entertained by more than one of our\r\neminent booksellers.\r\n\r\nMr. Quaritch, without adducing the least amount of evidence, asserts\r\nthat “Hakluyt intended to insert this map in his work of 1589.” This is\r\nimpossible, as from internal evidence it could not possibly have been\r\nproduced at an earlier period than 1598 or 1599, as has been before\r\npointed out. Upon this point we fear that Mr. Quaritch has allowed\r\nhimself to be misled by the pardonable blunder of Hallam. Again he\r\nsays, that Hakluyt calls the original of our great map a terrestrial\r\nglobe. This is also a mistake. When Hakluyt said a globe, he meant one,\r\nand not a map; such a globe as he describes was forthcoming in 1592,\r\nat a period midway between the first edition of the “Voyages” and the\r\nappearance of our map. The only example of this globe at present known\r\nto exist is preserved in the Library of the Middle Temple.\r\n\r\nHitherto one of the difficulties in describing and establishing the\r\nidentity of this map has been its anonymous authorship. Mr. Quaritch,\r\nin an otherwise fair appreciation of the writer’s labours in this\r\ndirection, has thought fit, in another part of his catalogue, to\r\ncharge the writer with appropriating Mr. Quaritch’s labours in this\r\nmatter of authorship. The charge has found no foundation in any fact\r\nwhatsoever. The writer’s conclusions about it were based solely upon\r\na comparison made between our map and a globe, two things which Mr.\r\nQuaritch has confounded. The globe referred to is known to be by\r\nMolyneux, the reference to it in the title of the map led the writer to\r\nthe not unnatural inference that they were by one and the same author.\r\nThis position the writer strengthened by two quotations from a scarce\r\ntract by the late Dr. J. G. Kohl of Bremen, which was published twenty\r\nyears before Mr. Quaritch’s catalogue of 1877 [No. 11919] saw the\r\nlight. The conclusion arrived at by the writer, without any assistance\r\nfrom Quaritch, was that our map, circa 1600, was a new one, on a new\r\nprojection, made by one of the most eminent globe-makers of his time,\r\nprobably under the superintendence of Hakluyt. The evidence upon this\r\npoint is of course strongly circumstantial only, which future research\r\nmay either refute or confirm. Be this as it may, one thing is now quite\r\ncertain, namely, that our map, to a very great extent, bears evidence\r\nupon the face of it of the handiwork of another of Hakluyt’s friends\r\nand colleagues, hitherto unsuspected, we take it, even by Mr. Quaritch.\r\nAllusion has been already made to Wright’s “Errors in Navigation,” the\r\nfirst edition of which was published in 1599. In 1610 appeared the\r\nsecond edition, in which mention is made of a general map, which map\r\nit has not been our good fortune to see, as the copy in our national\r\nlibrary is without it. Several editions were subsequently published by\r\nMoxon. In these are to be seen copies of a map laid down upon lines\r\nalmost identical with ours. They have geographical additions up to\r\ndate, and also indicate the variations of the compass. These later maps\r\nare avowedly ascribed to Wright, and a comparison of any one of them\r\nwith our map most certainly points to one common source, namely, the\r\noriginal. The conclusion is therefore irresistible, that whatever may\r\nbe due to Molineux or Hakluyt in the execution of the original, it also\r\nrepresents the first map upon the true projection by Edward Wright. It\r\nwill be observed as a somewhat happy coincidence that Hallam’s almost\r\nfirst words of introduction to our map are a reference to the Arctic\r\nwork of Davis, 1585–1587. On the map is also to be observed a record\r\nof the discovery by the Dutchman Barents, of northern Novaya Zemlya,\r\nin his third voyage in 1596. This is the latest geographical discovery\r\nrecorded upon it, which serves not only to determine the date of the\r\nmap, but to establish for it the undoubted claim of being the earliest\r\none engraved in England, whereon this last important Arctic discovery\r\nis to be found. The striking similarity between our map and Molineux’s\r\nglobe, in the delineations of these Arctic discoveries of Davis and\r\nBarents, seems to point to the conclusion that, so far as the geography\r\nis concerned, they both came from one source, namely, the hands of\r\nMolyneux.\r\n\r\nArctic discovery did not escape the notice of our immortal Shakespere.\r\nIn some fifty lines preceding his supposed reference to our map in\r\n“Twelfth Night,” occur the following words. “You are now sailed into\r\nthe north of my lady’s opinion, where you will hang like an icicle\r\non a Dutchman’s beard.” The antithetical idea being of course the\r\nequatorial region of the lady’s opinion. If the date assigned to it\r\nis correct it is probable in the extreme that the thought underlying\r\nthese words was suggested to the mind of Shakespere by a glance at\r\nthe upper portion of our map, evidently well known in his time as a\r\nseparate publication. The remaining points that call for notice are as\r\nfollows. The improved geography of the whole of the eastern portion of\r\nour map, as compared with its contemporaries, and the traces of the\r\nfirst appearance of the Dutch under Davis and Houtman at Bantam. On all\r\nthe maps was to be seen the huge Terra Australis of the old geography.\r\nThis, as Hallam remarked, had been left out on our map; but what is so\r\nremarkable is that upon it is to be observed, rising “like a little\r\ncloud out of the seas, like a man’s hand,” the then unknown continent\r\nof Australia. It will be observed that Hallam describes the original\r\nas “the best map of the sixteenth century.” Mr. Quaritch improves upon\r\nthis, and says it is “by far the finest chartographical labour which\r\nappeared, from the epoch of the discovery of America down to the time\r\nof d’Anville.” If this implies a reference to our map as a work of art,\r\n_i. e._ an engraving, we beg to differ from him, as such terms\r\nare misleading. As a specimen of map engraving, it will not compare\r\nwith even its pirated prototype by Hondius. The art of engraving by\r\nEnglishmen, more particularly that of maps, was at this period, as is\r\nwell known, in its infancy. Maps and illustrations for books were for\r\nthe most part executed abroad, and those who did work here were almost\r\nall foreigners. The two best known were Augustus Ryther, who executed\r\namong other things the maps for Saxton’s Atlas, and Hondius, who did\r\nthose for Speed’s Atlas. Mr. Richard Fisher writes: “We have scarcely\r\nany record of any Englishmen practising engraving in this country prior\r\nto the commencement of the seventeenth century.” The names, however,\r\nof two are afforded us by Davis himself in his Introduction to the\r\n“Seaman’s Secrets,” namely, those of Molyneux and Hillyer. It is to\r\nbe hoped that the position of our map in the history of cartography\r\nis secured upon firmer grounds than those suggested by the best\r\nintentions of Mr. Quaritch. It was the writer’s belief in this that\r\nfirst led him to express the hope that the original of the facsimile,\r\nso admirably done for the Society, would henceforth be as firmly\r\nassociated with Shakespere’s “Twelfth Night” as it certainly is now,\r\nnot only with the page of Hakluyt, but with the publications of the\r\nSociety that bears his name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n          (_Embracing much additional data._--See _Preface_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   A\r\n\r\n    Abano--Apponensis, Aponus, Apianus, Apian, Bienewitz--Pietro di,\r\n        “Tractatus de Venenis”; “Conciliator differentiarum ...,” 26,\r\n        35, 124, 501, 515, 526, 527.\r\n      _See_ Mazzuchelli, G.

Le cycle de 60 années dont les séries se suivent depuis la\r\n61^e année du règne de Hoang-ti, sans interruption et avec autant de\r\nrégularité que les siècles dans les computs Européens.” And Saillant\r\net Nyon (“Mémoires concernant l’histoire,” Vol. XIII. p. 76) add\r\nconclusively: “Depuis l’année courante (1769) jusqu’à la 2637^e avant\r\nl’ère Chrétienne, qui répond exactement à la 61^e du règne de Hoang-ti,\r\non peut sans crainte de s’égarer, suivre un des plus beaux sentiers de\r\nl’histoire, pendant l’espace de 4406 ans.”\r\n\r\nIncidentally, we may add that in his “History of Chaldea,” New York,\r\n1866, pp. 195, 213, 364, Mr. Z. A. Ragozin says that that country can\r\npoint to a monumentally recorded date nearly 4000 B.C.--more than\r\nEgypt can do--and he says, furthermore, “we cannot possibly accept a\r\ndate later than 4000 B.C. for the foreign immigration, and, for the\r\nShumiro-Accadian culture, less than 1000 years, thus taking us as far\r\nback as 5000 B.C. The date of 3750 B.C. is that of Naram-Sin, and\r\n3800 B.C. is now generally accepted for Sargon of Agadê--_perhaps the\r\nremotest authentic date yet arrived at in history_. To such as are\r\ninclined to doubt the authenticity of these early dates, as well as\r\nthe truthfulness of “the mensuration of divine periods,” and of “the\r\nobservations of celestial bodies throughout the whole of time,” it will\r\nbe interesting to note the following, taken from the Greek “Iamblichus”\r\ntranslation of Thomas Taylor, Chiswick, 1821, p. 318: “Proclus (in\r\n_Tim._, lib. iv. p. 277) informs us that the Chaldeans had observations\r\nof the stars which embraced whole mundane periods ... likewise\r\nconfirmed by Cicero, who says (in his first book on Divination) that\r\nthey had records of the stars for the space of 370,000 years, and by\r\nDiodorus Siculus (‘Bibl.,’ lib. xi. p. 118), who states that their\r\nobservations comprehended the space of 473,000 years!”\r\n\r\n[2] “Le monument le plus ancien (de pierre sculptée) signalé\r\npar le King-che-so porte sur une façade cette scène d’histoire:\r\n‘Tcheou-Choung, régent de l’empire pendant la minorité de son\r\nneveu Tching-Ouang (1110 av. J. C.) reçoit les envois du roi des\r\nYue-tchang-che.... Les anciens auteurs Chinois rapportent que ces\r\nambassadeurs offrirent à la cour de Chine des éléphants et des faisans\r\nblancs et que pour leur retour Tcheou-Koung leur fit présent de chars\r\nqui montraient le sud.’” (“L’art Chinois,” par M. Paléologue, Paris,\r\n1888, pp. 132–134; J. P. Pauthier, “Chine,” p. 87.)\r\n\r\n[3] While the Greeks steered by the Great Bear, which, if a more\r\nvisible, was a far more uncertain guide, the Phœnicians had, at an\r\nearly time, discovered a less conspicuous but more trustworthy guide\r\nin the polar star, which the Greeks call _The Phœnician Star_\r\n(“History of Antiquity,” Prof. Max Duncker, translated by Evelyn\r\nAbbott, London, 1882, Vol. II. p. 293).\r\n\r\n[4] The Etruscans “inquired, under the direction of technical rules,\r\ninto the hidden properties of nature, particularly those of the\r\nelectric phenomena.” “History of the Romans,” by Chas. Merivale, New\r\nYork, 1880, Vol. II. p. 395. (Cicero, “De Divin.,” i. 41–42; Diod.\r\nSic., v. 40; Senec., “Nat. Qu.,” ii. 32; Micali, “l’Italie,” ii. 246\r\nfoll.).\r\n\r\n[5] In this Chapter I of Book II Gilbert says that Aristotle admits\r\nonly of two simple movements of his elements, from the centre and\r\ntoward the centre ... so that in the earth there is but one motion of\r\nall its parts towards the centre of the world--a wild headlong falling.\r\nJohannes Franciscus Offusius (the author of “De divina astrorum\r\nfacultate,” Paris, 1570), says he distinguishes several magnetic\r\nmovements, the first to the centre, the second to the pole, traversing\r\nseventy-seven degrees, the third to iron, the fourth to a loadstone.\r\n\r\n[6] At p. 16, note No. 4, of his “Dawn of Civilization,” New York,\r\n1894, Mr. G. Maspero says that the well-known French archæologist,\r\nCharles Théodule Deveria (1831–1871), was the first to prove that the\r\nEgyptians believed the sky to be made of iron or steel. This was done\r\nin his monograph entitled “Le fer et l’aimant, leur nom et leur usage\r\ndans l’ancienne Egypte,” published originally at Paris during 1872\r\nin “Mélanges d’Archéologie,” Vol. I. pp. 2–10; also by M. Charas, in\r\n“l’antiquité Historique,” first edition, pp. 64–67, and at pp. 339–356,\r\nVol. V. of the “Bibliothèque Egyptologique,” issued in Paris during\r\n1897. So well established was the belief in a sky-ceiling of iron,\r\nsays M. Charas, that it was preserved in common speech by means of\r\nthe name given to the metal itself, viz. _Bai-ni-pit_ (in the Coptic,\r\n_Benipi_, _benipe_)--_metal of heaven_. Reference is thereto made in\r\n“The Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature,” Vol. XIV. second\r\nseries, p. 291, by Mr. J. Offord, Jr., who speaks of the splendid and\r\nexceedingly valuable papyrus in the Louvre “Catalogue des Manuscripts,”\r\nParis, 1874, pp. 170–171 of M. Deveria, who frequently referred to it\r\nin the preparation of the monograph above alluded to upon Iron and\r\nthe Loadstone in Ancient Egypt (“Zeitschrift für Ægyptische Sprache\r\nund Alterthumskunde”--Review founded by M. le Docteur H. Brugsch).\r\nDeveria says: “Cette matière céleste (dont parle Plutarque) devait\r\nêtre l’aimant, la substance d’Horus, la siderites des Romains, plutôt\r\nque le fer non-magnétique, substance typhonienne.... Ils disent aussi\r\nque la pierre d’aimant est un des os de Horus et le fer un des os de\r\nTyphon: c’est Manathon qui nous l’apprend.” For Deveria, see “La Grande\r\nEncyclopédie,” H. Lamirault et Cie., Paris, n. d., Vol. XIV. p. 375.\r\n\r\n[7] The word _calamita_ was first used by the Italians. It is\r\nemployed by Petri de Vineis (Pierre des Vignes), Matthieu de Messine,\r\nthe notary of Lentino, and by Guido Guinicelli of Bologna (Libri,\r\n“Hist. des Sc. Mathém.,” Vol. II. pp. 66–69). Consult likewise C.\r\nFalconet, “Dissert. Histor.,” Paris, 1746; “Le Journal des Sçavans” for\r\nJuly-December 1724, Vol. LXXV. pp. 22–28; W. Falconer, Vol. III. of the\r\n“Mem. of the Society of Manchester,” also “Bibl. Britan.,” 1798, Vol.\r\nVIII. p. 281.\r\n\r\nIn the “Essai d’un Glossaire Occitanien” (“Le Journal des Savants”\r\nfor June 1820, pp. 369–370) it is said about M. de Rochegude that\r\nhe discovered in “La Vie de St. Honorat de Lérins,” written by\r\nRaimont Féraut in 1300, the words _caramida_, _caramita_, which he\r\ninterprets as _calamite_, _aimant_, _boussole_, and that he also read\r\nin the “Bergeries” of Remy Belleau (1528–1577) the words _calamite\r\nou aiguille aimantée_. He found that Joachim du Bellay (1524–1560)\r\nhad written “Comme le fer qui suit la calamite,” and Nicholas Rapin\r\n(1540–1608) “Tourne ma calamite,” but, after examining all the\r\nancient works obtainable, he concluded that the poem of Raimont\r\nFéraut, admitted by him to have been translated from an old Latin\r\nMS., is the earliest publication containing the word adopted by many\r\nto designate the compass. The poem alluded to is the only one extant\r\nof Raimont Féraut--Raymond Féraudi de Thoard--a troubadour, long at\r\nthe court of Charles II of Naples, who died about A.D. 1324 (“Biogr.\r\nGénér.”--Hœfer--Vol. XVII. p. 354).\r\n\r\n[8] “If an adamant be set by iron, it suffereth not the iron to come to\r\nthe magnet, but it draweth it by a manner of violence, from the magnet,\r\nso that though the magnet draweth iron to itself, the adamant draweth\r\nit away from the magnet” (Mediæval Lore, “Gleanings from Barthol. de\r\nGlanvilla,” by Robert Steele, London, 1893, Chap. IX. p. 32). The great\r\n“Liber de Proprietatibus Rerum,” which has been elsewhere cited in this\r\ncompilation, was undoubtedly written by Glanvilla (who, according to\r\nSalimbene, author of the “Chronicles of Parma,” had been a professor of\r\ntheology in the Paris University) before the year 1260, for, as Steele\r\nremarks, he cites Albertus Magnus, who was in Paris during 1248, but\r\ndoes not quote from either Vincent de Beauvais, Thomas Aquinas, Roger\r\nBacon or Egidius Colonna, all of whom were in Paris during the second\r\nhalf of the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\n[9] It is scarcely necessary to add that the afore-named method of\r\nsuspension is impracticable. This curious problem was deemed worthy of\r\na memoir by M. J. Plateau, communicated to the “Académie des Sciences”\r\nat its _séance_ of November 28, 1864 (“Le Moniteur Scientifique,”\r\npar le Dr. Quesneville, Vol. VI. p. 1146).\r\n\r\n[10] The “Historiæ Hierosolimitanæ” relates all that passed in the\r\nkingdom of Jerusalem from 1177 to the siege of Ptolemais inclusively\r\n(“History of the Crusades,” Joseph François Michaud, translated by W.\r\nRobson, Vol. I. p. 456).\r\n\r\n[11] THE ASTROLABE.--For descriptions of astrolabes used by\r\nthe Arabs, see pp. 338–357 of “Matériaux ... Sciences Mathém.,” by\r\nL. A. Sedillot, Paris, 1845, and for plates showing the construction\r\nof the compass and other nautical instruments of his time, consult\r\nCrescentio (Bartolomeo), “Nautica Mediterranea,” Rome, 1602.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the astrolabe is ascribed to Hipparchus, and Chaucer’s\r\ndescription in 1391 is the first book treating of it in time and\r\nimportance. In Chaucer’s “Treatise on the Astrolabe,” he declares his\r\nintention of making use of the calendars of the reverend clerks John\r\nSomer and Nicholas of Lynne. His reference here is to the Minorite\r\nastronomer John Somer--Semur--Somerarius--and to the Carmelite\r\nNicholas, who was lecturer in theology at Oxford (“Dict. of Nat.\r\nBiog.,” Vol. LIII. p. 219).\r\n\r\nSee the illustrated description of an astrolabe by S. A. Ionides, in\r\n“Geog. Journ.” for Oct. 1904, pp. 411–417, accompanying references to\r\nother works treating of astrolabes; “Le Courrier du Livre,” Quebec,\r\n1899, Vol. III. p. 159, alluding to three works on the astrolabe of\r\nSamuel Champlin and Geoffrey Chaucer; “Canada,” by J. G. Bourinot,\r\nLondon, 1897, p. 79, with cut of Champlin’s lost astrolabe made in\r\nParis during 1603; also the entry for Nicholas Bion to be found herein\r\nat A.D. 1702.\r\n\r\n[12] Vincent de Beauvais desired to facilitate the pursuit of learning\r\nby collecting into one large work everything useful to be known in art,\r\nhistory, natural science and philosophy, “so that the great edifice of\r\nscience should be once more presented with all its halls and porticos\r\nforming one harmonious whole, _domed_ over, if we may so express\r\nourselves, with theology and surmounted by the Cross” (“Eccl. History,”\r\nRohrbacher, Vol. XVIII. p. 444, quoted at pp. 86 and 89 of “Christian\r\nSchools and Scholars,” London, 1867). His “Speculum Majus,” of which\r\nthe most trustworthy edition was that published at Strasbourg in ten\r\nlarge folio volumes during 1473, consisted of three parts: “Speculum\r\nNaturale,” 32 books and 3718 chapters; “Speculum Doctrinale,” 17 books\r\nand 2374 chapters; “Speculum Historiale,” 31 books and 3793 chapters,\r\na total of 80 books and 9885 chapters (“Encycl. Britan.,” ninth ed.,\r\nVol. XXIV. p. 235; “Paris et ses historiens,” Paris, 1867, p. 100,\r\nnote, indicating that, according to Fabricius, the “Speculum Naturale”\r\nmentions as many as 350 different names of Arabian, Greek and Latin\r\nauthors). The influence of the mediæval encyclopædias of Vincent\r\nde Beauvais, Brunetto Latini and Bartholomew Anglicus on Western\r\nLiterature of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries is presented\r\nin Liliencron’s “Festrede,” München, 1876 (J. E. Sandys, “Classical\r\nScholarship,” 1903, p. 558).\r\n\r\n[13] In his “De Mineralibus” (Lyons ed. 1651, Treat. III. lib. ii.\r\ncap. 6, p. 243), Albertus says: “One angle ... is to the _zohron_\r\n(north) ... but another angle of the magnet opposite to it attracts\r\nto the _aphron_ (south).” Cardan (“De Subtilitate,” Lugduni,\r\n1663); Salmanazar (Book II. “of the Egyptian Hermitus, 19 stars, and 15\r\nstones, and 15 herbs, and 15 figures”: “on one side the magnet attracts\r\niron, on the other side repels it); Pietro d’ Abano (“Conciliator\r\nDifferentiarum,” Mantuæ, 1472, Diff. 51, p. 104, or the 1520 Venice\r\nedition, p. 73: “know that a magnet is discovered which attracts iron\r\non one side and repels it on the other”).\r\n\r\n[14] Albertus was the first schoolman who lectured on the Stagirite,\r\nand who in his unbounded range of knowledge comprehends the whole\r\nmetaphysical, moral, physical, as well as logical system of Aristotle\r\n(“History of Latin Christianity,” by the Rev. H. H. Milman, London,\r\n1857, Vol. VI. pp. 270, 277). The first knowledge of the Aristotelian\r\nphilosophy in the Middle Ages was acquired by translators of\r\nAristotle’s works out of the Arabic. The Arabian commentators were\r\nconsidered the most skilful and authentic guides in the study of his\r\nsystem (“Hist. of the Reign of Charles V,” Robertson and Prescott,\r\nPhilad., 1883, Vol. I. p. 308; Conring, “Antiq.

Drissler,” New York, 1894; Humboldt, “Cosmos,” 1860, Vol.\r\nII. pp. 215–216).\r\n\r\n[15] See “Omar Khayyám and his position in the History of Sufism,” to\r\nbe found at end of the singularly attractive volume entitled “Sufi\r\nInterpretations ...” by C. H. A. Bjerregaard, New York, 1902. For\r\nan account of Omar Khayyám--Kheyyám (died in 1123), who was a very\r\ndistinguished Persian philosopher, mathematician, poet and astronomer,\r\nalso Director of the Bagdad Observatory, consult the ninth ed. of the\r\n“Encycl. Britann.,” Vol. XVII. pp. 771–772; “La Grande Encycl.,” Vol.\r\nXXV. pp. 372–373; “The Universal Cyclopædia,” Chas. Kendall Adams, New\r\nYork, 1900, Vol. VIII. p. 588.\r\n\r\n[16] Identified by some authors as John Peckham, a disciple of St.\r\nBonaventura, who became Archbishop of Canterbury from 1278 to 1293\r\n(“Christian Schools and Scholars,” by Augusta Th. Drane, London, 1867,\r\nVol. II. p. 172).\r\n\r\n[17] To Peregrinus is due the first inception of the _terrella_.\r\nHe makes the magnet round, and says, “You must know that this stone\r\nbears in itself a likeness of the heavens and contains two points,\r\none North and the other South, thus resembling the poles of the\r\nsky....” In his Memoria Prima, “Sopra P. P. de Maricourt,” 1868, P.\r\nD. Timoteo Bertelli Barnabita states (Chap. VI. p. 22) that, besides\r\nthe _terrella_, Gilbert appropriated other observations and\r\nexperiments of Peregrinus, and, farther on (Chap. VII. p. 28), he gives\r\nus the following extract from Thévenot: “_L’on voit encore que la\r\npluspart des choses que l’on attribue à Gilbert et qui luy ont donné\r\nla réputation de Père de la Philosophie de l’Ayman estaient scües dès\r\nle treizième siècle._” This, says he (in a note, pp. 28–29), is\r\ndoubtless an exaggeration. That Gilbert took from P. Peregrinus his\r\n_terrella_ and many excellent scientific plans on magnetism,\r\nthe ideas of others also, is probable, but it is indubitable that\r\nmuch was his own, and that, for his time, his work is a _veritable\r\nchef-d’œuvre_ of inductive and experimental method and the most\r\nfinished treatise on magnetism which had up to that time appeared.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, Bertelli adds (Part III. p. 92): “We must conclude\r\nthat historical truth was undoubtedly distorted when, for so long a\r\nperiod, it was asserted and repeated, without any sufficient mature\r\ninvestigation, that the famous William Gilbert of Colchester was the\r\nreal and sole founder of magnetism and of the inductive method in\r\nexperimental science. We certainly must not deny him the no small\r\nmerit which is his due, nor the share he had in the discoveries at\r\nthe commencement of the seventeenth century, but we must, likewise,\r\nconfess that the copious collection of facts which he gives us, and\r\nthe experimental and discursive method with which he presents them\r\nis neither altogether his own nor is it new” (see W. Wenkebach, “Sur\r\nPetrus Adsigerius,” Rome, 1865, p. 8; “Universal Lexicon,” Leipzig,\r\n1741; N. Cabæus, “Phil. Magn.,” Ferrara, 1629, p. 23).\r\n\r\n[18] In this same sense does Ristoro d’Arezzo write in his “La\r\nCompositione del Mondo ... del 1282,” transcribed by Enrico Narducci,\r\nRoma, 1859, pp. 172, 316, xi, xii. Ristoro calls the needle\r\n_angola_ (lib. xxxix. p. 326,), which, says he, guides the mariner\r\nand which is itself directed (_per la virtu del cielo_) by the\r\nstar called tramontane (pp. 110, 263–4, 326); see “Pietro Peregrino,”\r\nBertelli, 1858, pp. 55, 130.\r\n\r\n[19] Dr. Geo. Miller names (“Hist. Phil. Ill.,” London, 1849, Vol. I.\r\np. 180, note) Guyot de Provins, Jacques de Vitry and Brunetto Latini,\r\nas referring to the compass. He adds that the Chronicle of France\r\nintimates the use of this instrument under the name of _marinette_\r\ntowards the time of the first of the voyages of the Crusaders\r\nundertaken by Louis IX, and that Hughes de Bercy, a contemporary of\r\nthat prince, speaks of it as well known in that country. For these\r\nreasons, says he, “the credit of the invention must be denied to Flavio\r\nde Melfi, or Flavio Gioia, a Neapolitan, who is commonly said to have\r\nconstructed the first compass about the year 1302, on account of which\r\nthe province of Principato, in which he was born, bears one of these\r\ninstruments for its arms.\r\n\r\n[20] It is interesting to note that the “Confessio Amantis,” which went\r\nthrough as many as four editions before the year 1560, is a huge work\r\nof nearly thirty-five thousand lines which was written at the desire of\r\nKing Richard II of England between the years 1377 and 1393.\r\n\r\n[21] Les Roses des Vents n’apparaissent pas sur les cartes avant\r\nle xvi^e siècle (“Annales de Géographie,” VI. 1897, p. 14 de la\r\nBibliographie). See A.D. 1436 entry.\r\n\r\n[22] Incidentally, it may be mentioned that when the laws of Castile\r\nwere collected in a Code, during the reign of Alfonso the tenth,\r\nsurnamed _El Sabio_, the learned, the compilers divided the work\r\ninto seven volumes or parts (_siete partidas_) in order that\r\neach volume or part might be dedicated to one of the seven letters\r\nconstituting Alfonso’s name (“Dedication of Books,” New York, 1881, pp.\r\n17–18).\r\n\r\n[23] See “Geographical Journal,” Vol. V. March 1895, No. 3,\r\n“Pre-Columbian Discovery of America,” pp. 222, 224, 226, for sketches\r\nof Andrea Bianco’s Map of 1448.\r\n\r\n[24] In Kohl’s collection of early maps already alluded to as given\r\nin “Harv. Univ. Bull.,” Vol. III, reference is made (p. 175) to the\r\nportolano--A.D. 1426--of a Venetian hydrographer, Giacomo\r\nGiraldi, which has been preserved in the Biblioteca Marciana and which\r\nwas reproduced at Venice by Ongania in 1881, also (p. 303) to the Map\r\nof America published during 1570 by Abraham Oertel--Ortell--_b._\r\n1527, _d._ 1598, and at p. 365 to the Map of the World by Joannes\r\nOliva, A.D. 1613, as well as to an Atlas by Salvatore Oliva,\r\nA.D. 1620, showing both the Americas. In an article headed\r\n“The first true Maps,” to be found in “Nature” of December 15, 1904,\r\npp. 159–161, mention is made that the oldest dated portolan is the\r\nfirst of Pietro Vesconte--Visconti--executed in 1311.\r\n\r\n[25] For Nautonniez, see Houzeau et Lancaster, “Bibl. Gén.,” Vol.\r\nI. part ii. p. 1193, also J-G. T. Græsse, “Trésor de Livres Rares,”\r\nDresde, 1863, Vol. IV. p. 651, and Brunet, “Manuel,” p. 827, at\r\nwhich latter appears the statement of M. Frère to the effect that\r\nGuillaume de Nautonnier--Nautonniez--caused to be reprinted, under the\r\nabove-named title of “Mécométrie de l’Eymant,” the “Dialogue de la\r\nLongitude” of Toussaincte de Bessard originally published at Rouen in\r\n1574.\r\n\r\nFor the reported investigation of Pedro da Medina, who, Gilbert says,\r\n(“De Magnete,” Book IV. chap. viii.) does not accept variation and has\r\nwith many errors disgraced the art of navigation, consult, preferably,\r\nthe Venetia 1555 edition entitled “L’Arte del navegar,” Libro sesto,\r\n“Della Aguggia, over bossolo da navegar,” pp. cviii-cxvi. The leaf\r\nxxiii contains a Map of America. This last-named map of the Nuevo Mundo\r\n“may be taken to represent the results of Spanish discovery about 1540,\r\nPedro da Medina having been the official examiner of pilots. It is\r\ninteresting as showing the mouth of the Spirito Santo (the Mississippi)\r\nand the lands around the river and gulf of St. Lawrence. The Island of\r\nCape Breton appears as part of Nova Scotia and of the mainland; but\r\nNewfoundland is represented as three islands, divided from Northern\r\nCanada by a much wider expanse of water than the actual Straits of\r\nBelle Isle. This is, however, a striking instance of the great extent\r\nof Medina’s geographical knowledge. The river Saguenay is shown at its\r\nentry into the St. Lawrence, which is also a remarkable feature in so\r\nearly a map.”\r\n\r\n[26] Behaim’s justly famous globe was made up from the authorities of\r\nPtolemy, Pliny and Strabo, as well as from the reports of Marco Polo’s\r\ntravels and the semi-fabulous travels of Sir John Mandeville (“English\r\nCyclopædia,” Vol. I. p. 617).\r\n\r\n[27] Aguilhas, in Portuguese, signifies needles: Walker, “Magnetism of\r\nShips,” 1853, p. 2; Sir Thomas Browne, “Pseud.

It\r\nis difficult to connect the periodic variations which characterize\r\nthe three principal forms of magnetic phenomena (the isoclinic, the\r\nisogonic and the isodynamic lines) with this rigid system of the\r\ndistribution of force and mass, unless we represent to ourselves the\r\nattractive force of the material particles modified by similar periodic\r\nchanges of temperature in the interior of the terrestrial planet....\r\nOf these lines, the isogonic are the most important in their immediate\r\napplication to navigation, whilst we find from the most recent views\r\nthat the isodynamic, especially those which indicate the horizontal\r\nforce, are the most valuable elements in the theory of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism (Humboldt, “Cosmos,” 1859–1860, Vol. I. pp. 180–181, 185;\r\nVol. II. p. 334, wherein references are made to Gauss, “Resultate\r\nder Beob. des Magn. Vereins,” 1838, s. 21; Sabine, “Report on the\r\nVariations of the Magnetic Intensity,” p. 63).\r\n\r\n[31] The reader is referred to Appendix I herein for “Accounts of early\r\nwriters and others alluded to in Gilbert’s ‘De Magnete,’ not already\r\ndisposed of throughout this Bibliographical History.” Gilbert says\r\nthat only a few points touching the loadstone are briefly mentioned by\r\nMarbodeus Gallus, Albertus, Mattæus Silvaticus, Hermolaus Barbarus,\r\nCamillus Leonhardus, Cornelius Agrippa, Fallopius, Joannes Langius,\r\nCardinal de Cusa, Hannibal Rosetius Calaber, all of whom repeat only\r\nthe figments of others.\r\n\r\n[32] Sir Kenelm Digby (“Treatise of the Nature of Bodies,” 1645, Chap.\r\nXX. p. 225) says that the manner in which Gilbert “arrived to discover\r\nso much of magnetical philosophy” and “all the knowledge he got on the\r\nsubject, was by forming a little loadstone into the shape of the earth.\r\nBy which means he composed a wonderful designe, which was to make the\r\nwhole globe of the earth maniable; for he found the properties of the\r\nwhole earth in that little body ... which he could manage and try\r\nexperiments upon at his will....” In the note at p. 47 (P. Peregrinus,\r\nA.D. 1269), it will be seen that the _terrella_ was constructed by\r\nboth in practically the same manner: only Peregrinus considered it\r\n“a likeness to the heavens,” whilst Gilbert regarded it as the earth\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[33] The magnetized versorium consisted of a piece of iron, or needle,\r\nresting upon a point, or pin, and was put in motion, excited, by the\r\nloadstone or natural magnet. The non-magnetized versorium was made of\r\nany sort of metal, for use in electrical experiments (“De Magnete,”\r\nBook II. chap. ii.; Book III. chap. i.).\r\n\r\n[34] Asterisks. As Gilbert remarks in his Author’s Preface, he has set\r\nover against “the great multitude” of his discoveries and experiments\r\nlarger and smaller asterisks according to their importance and their\r\nsubtility; all of his experiments having been, says he, “investigated\r\nand again and again done and repeated under our eyes.” There are, in\r\nall, 178 small and 21 large asterisks, some of them being attached to\r\nillustrations, of which latter there are as many as 84 throughout the\r\nwork. See Appendix II herein.\r\n\r\n[35] Humboldt, “Cosmos,” 1849, Vol. I. p. 170, and Vol. II. pp. 717–718.\r\n\r\n[36] Sir Wm.

Possessed of a more minute and practical\r\nknowledge of natural philosophy than Bacon, his opposition to the\r\nphilosophy of the schools was more searching and particular, and at the\r\nsame time probably little less efficient” (“Memoirs of the Life of Sir\r\nHumphry Davy,” London, 1836, Vol. I. p. 311).\r\n\r\n[40] Gilbert’s near kinsman, Rev. William Gilbert, of Brental Ely, in\r\nSuffolk.\r\n\r\n[41] At the first chapter of Books I., III. and IV.\r\n\r\n[42] “Philosophia magnetica in qua magnetis natura penitus\r\nexplicatur....” An important work on the loadstone, in which the author\r\noften confutes the published treatise of Dr. Gilbert of Colchester, and\r\nquotes the inedited writings of L. Garzoni, who, even before Gilbert,\r\nhad made researches respecting the magnet. A curious chapter in the\r\n“Philosophia” institutes a comparison between electrical and magnetical\r\nattraction (Libri, “Catalogue,” 1871, Part. I. p. 161).\r\n\r\n[43] It is in the afore-mentioned Book IV. chap. i. that Gilbert makes\r\nmention of Norumbega, “the lost city of New England,” regarding which\r\nlatter very interesting particulars will be found in the following\r\npublications: “Magazine of Amer. Hist.” for 1877, pp. 14, 321, and for\r\n1886, p. 291; “New England’s Lost City Found”; Lang’s “Sagas of the\r\nKings of Norway”; “Antiquitates Americanæ,” Royal Soc. of Copenhagen;\r\nShea’s “Catholic Church in Colonial Days”; “Narrative and Critical\r\nHistory of America,” by Justin Winsor, Boston, 1889, Vol. II. pp.\r\n451, 453, 459, 472; Vol. III. pp. 169–218; Vol. IV. pp. 53, 71, 88,\r\n91–99, 101, 152, 373, 384; Vol. V. p. 479; R.

After this, I did collect all such Notes\r\nto this purpose, as I met with in the course of my other Studies.\r\nFrom whence when I had received full satisfaction, I did for mine own\r\nfurther delight compose them into this method.”--_The Author._\r\n\r\n[45] In the second edition of Digby’s “The Immortality of Reasonable\r\nSoules” (“a treatise on the soul proving its immortality”), published\r\nduring the year 1645, are to be found attractive portraits of himself\r\nand of his wife, Venetia Anastasia Stanley, daughter of Sir Edward\r\nStanley, of Tongue Castle, one of the celebrated beauties of her day.\r\n\r\n[46] Libri says (“Catal.,” 1861, Pt. II. p. 701) that the learned\r\nJesuit, Schott, seems to have been very conversant with angels, for\r\nhe not only dedicated his “Magia Naturalis” to an angel, but likewise\r\nanother of his works, the “Magia Arithmetica,” wherein he indicates\r\nthe total _number of the angels_ in existence, that number being\r\ncomposed of sixty-eight numerical figures.\r\n\r\n[47] “The meetings, from which the Royal Society originated, commenced\r\nabout the year 1645, a number of persons having then begun to assemble\r\nfor the consideration of all subjects connected with experimental\r\ninquiries; all questions of theology and policy being expressly\r\nprecluded” (Dr. Geo. Miller, from Harris’s “Life of Charles II,” Vol.\r\nI. p. 7, London, 1766).\r\n\r\n[48] In the entry at p. 223, Part I of Libri’s “Catal.” for 1861 it is\r\nsaid that, in the first volume of the works of A. S. Conti, who was the\r\nintimate friend of Sir Isaac Newton, we find for the first time mention\r\nof the fact that the aurora is supposed to be an electrical phenomenon.\r\n\r\n[49] “La perte de l’illustre M. Huygens est inestimable, peu de gens le\r\nsavent autant que moi; il a égalé, à mon avis, la réputation de Galilée\r\net de Descartes, et, aidé par ce qu’ils avaient fait, il a surpassé\r\nleurs découvertes.” (Extracted from a letter written by Leibnitz to\r\nBosange, July 26, 1695--“Journal des Savants,” for Nov. 1905, “Oeuvres\r\ncomplètes de Christian Huygens,” La Haye, 1905.)\r\n\r\n[50] Just here we may refer to the fact--for it is a fact--that the\r\nelectrical energy transmitted over a line, which may be many miles in\r\nlength, really does not travel by the wire connecting the two points.\r\nIt travels in the ether surrounding the wire. The wire itself is, in\r\nfact, the guiding core of the disturbances in the ether which proceed\r\noutward in all directions to unlimited distances. The guiding core\r\nor conducting wire is needed to focalize or direct the delivery of\r\nthe energy. This curious conclusion of science, then, that the power\r\nfrom the power-station wire travels in the space around the wires led\r\nfrom the station, is one of the results of recent electrical studies,\r\njust as with light those studies begun by Maxwell and Hertz have led\r\nto the inevitable conclusion that the light of the candle, the light\r\nof a kerosene lamp, and the light of a gas burner are all in essence\r\nelectrical phenomena, as are all forms of radiation in the ether\r\n(“Electricity During the Nineteenth Century,” Prof. Elihu Thomson,\r\nWashington, 1901).\r\n\r\n[51] Mr. Andrew Crosse (1784–1855) was a distinguished English\r\nscientist, author of “Experiments in Voltaic Electricity,” 1815,\r\nalluded to in _Phil.

The difference between the two theories is briefly\r\nthis, that according to the earlier a body is conceived to be deprived\r\nin combustion of a component principle, whereas according to the later\r\na component part of the atmosphere is conceived to be combined with it”\r\n(Dr. Geo.

The following curious array of figures is\r\nselected from Gauss’ many interesting calculations. He found that the\r\nearth’s magnetism is such as would result from the existence, in every\r\ncubic yard of its mass, of six magnetized steel bars, each weighing one\r\npound. Compared with one such magnet, the magnetism of the earth is\r\nrepresented by 8,464,000,000,000,000,000,000 (“Am. Ann. of Sc. Dis.,”\r\n1852, p. iii).\r\n\r\n[59] Whewell, “Hist. of Induc. Sci.,” 1859, Vol. II. p. 244. It paved\r\nthe way for his subsequent identification of the forces of electricity,\r\ngalvanism and magnetism.\r\n\r\nProf. W. B. Rogers remarks that attempts to discover this connection\r\nhad been made with galvanic piles or batteries whose poles were not\r\nconnected by conductors, under the expectation that these would\r\nshow magnetical relations, although in such cases the electricity\r\naccumulated at the extremities was evidently stagnant. It was reserved\r\nfor Oersted first to bring into prominent view the fact that it was\r\nnot while the electricity was thus at rest, but while it was flowing\r\nthrough the wire connecting the two poles, that it exhibited magnetic\r\naction, and that a wire thus carrying a current, while it had the\r\npower of affecting a magnetic needle, was in turn susceptible of being\r\nacted on by a magnet; and this was the initial step in the science of\r\nelectro-magnetism.\r\n\r\n[60] See the 1839 ed. of “Experimental Researches”: I, “Voltaic\r\nElectricity,” par. 268; II, “Ordinary Electricity,” par. 284; III,\r\n“Magneto-Electricity,” par. 343; IV, “Thermo-Electricity,” par. 349; V,\r\n“Animal Electricity,” par. 351.\r\n\r\n[61] In English measure, the metre is ¹⁄₁₁ yd., the milligramme is ¹⁄₆₅\r\nof a grain; the kilogramme is 2 lb. 3¼ oz.\r\n\r\n[62] In the Summa of Theology was presented, says Ozanam Antoine\r\nFrédéric, a vast synthesis of the moral sciences, in which was unfolded\r\nall that could be known of God, of man and of their mutual relations--a\r\ntruly Catholic philosophy.... Sixtus of Sienna and Trithemius both\r\ndeclare that St. Thomas explained _all_ the works of Aristotle and\r\nthat he was the first Latin Doctor who did so (“Christian Schools and\r\nScholars,” p. 81).\r\n\r\nIt may also be added that, in the estimation of one of his biographers,\r\nthe greatest of the many disciples of St. Thomas was, by far, Dante\r\nAlighieri, in whose “Divina Commedia” the theology and philosophy of\r\nthe Middle Ages, as fixed by St. Thomas, have received the immortality\r\nwhich poetry alone can bestow.\r\n\r\n[63] Almagest was the name given to the great work of Aboulwéfa and was\r\nafterwards often applied to astronomical writings treating of celestial\r\nphenomena in general. The word is of Greek, not Arabic, origin, and\r\nsignifies a composition made up on a very extensive scale (“Journ. des\r\nSavants,” December 1843, p. 725, and March 1845, p. 150). Almagest\r\nwas also the name given to the extensive astronomical work by Ptolemy\r\nof Alexandria, which established the Ptolemaic System as astronomical\r\nscience for 1400 years, until overthrown by the system of Copernicus.\r\nPtolemy’s work (originally entitled “The Great Composition”), the Arabs\r\ncalled by the Greek word, _magisté_, “greatest,” and, with the\r\naddition by Arabic translators of their article _al_, “the,” the\r\nhybrid name “Almagest” came into use (“Encycl. Amer.,” Vol. I. n. p.;\r\n“Encycl. Britan.,” Edin., 1886, Vol. XX).\r\n\r\n[64] See résumé concerning the Astrolabe at A.D.\r\n1235–1315--Raymond Lully.\r\n\r\n[65] Sacro Bosco, here alluded to, is John Holywood or Halifax--in\r\nLatin, Johannes de Sacro Bosco or Sacro Busto--an English\r\nmathematician, said to have studied at Oxford and to have afterwards\r\nbecome a Professor of Astronomy at the University of Paris about the\r\nyear 1230. Sacro Bosco was one of the first, in the Middle Ages, to\r\navail himself of the Arabian writings on astronomy and is believed to\r\nhave condensed pretty much all the science therein contained in his own\r\nwell-known “Tractatus de Sphæra.” Of the latter, which was the second\r\nastronomical work to appear in print and which was first issued at\r\nFerrara in 1472, there were, it is said, as many as twenty-four more\r\neditions published before the year 1500. Houzeau says this “Tractatus”\r\nwas the standard for three centuries, and the writer in “La Grande\r\nEncyclopédie,” Vol. XXIX. p. 44, states that there were more than\r\nseventy Latin editions of it published between the fifteenth and the\r\nseventeenth centuries.\r\n\r\nHe is also the author of numerous other works, including “De\r\nAstrolabio” and a very meritorious “Tractatus de Arte Numerandi,” which\r\nlatter is reproduced at pp. 1–26 of the “Rara Mathematica” of Jas.\r\nOrchard Halliwell, London, 1839.\r\n\r\nThe best commentary ever written on the astronomy of Sacro Bosco is\r\nthe “Commentarius in sphæram ... of Christopher Clavius,” called the\r\nEuclid of his country. Clavius was born at Bamberg in 1538, died at\r\nRome in 1612, and, according to Houzeau, was the author of as many as\r\ntwenty-six different works on mathematics and astronomy. An almost\r\nequally valuable Commentary on the Sphere of Sacro Bosco was written\r\nby the famous encyclopedist Cecco d’Ascoli (1257–1327) whose real\r\nname, as we have already been informed, was Francesco degli Stabili\r\n(Libri, “Hist. des Sc.

He was a pupil of Plato, and is frequently mentioned by\r\nAratus, Archimedes, Aristotle, Cicero, Hipparchus, Proclus, Ptolemy,\r\nSeneca, Strabo, Vitruvius and others. Cicero calls him the greatest\r\nastronomer that has ever lived, and Strabo quotes him as a very\r\ndistinguished mathematician.\r\n\r\n[67] Apollonius of Tyana, a Pythagorean philosopher who lived in first\r\ncentury after Christ and who, in the account of his extraordinary\r\ntravels through India, reports having seen the precious stone\r\n_pantarbes_ casting rays of fire, and attracting all other gems,\r\nwhich adhered to it like swarms of bees (“Engl. Cycl.,” Chas. Knight,\r\nBiography, Vol. I. p. 266).\r\n\r\n[68] Comte (Isidore Auguste Marie François-Xavier) (1798–1857). Very\r\ncelebrated French philosopher, founder of Positivism, called Le\r\nFondateur de la religion de l’humanité. Consult: Caird (Edward), “The\r\nSocial Philosophy and Religion of Comte.”\r\n\r\n[69] With reference to the real discoverer, we can add here with\r\npropriety the words of John Fiske: “No ingenuity of argument can take\r\nfrom Columbus the glory of an achievement which has, and can have, no\r\nparallel in the whole career of mankind. It was a thing that could be\r\ndone but once!”\r\n\r\n[70] “... Aristotle adds that some say the earth being situated\r\nin the centre, is rolled around the pole, as it is written in the\r\n_Timæus_ ... there are three significations of the pole with\r\nPlato. Thus, in the _Phædo_, he calls heaven the pole, and also\r\nthe extremities of the axis about which the heaven revolves. But, in\r\nother places of the _Timæus_, and also in the present passage he\r\ncalls the axis the pole” (“The Treatises of Aristotle,” Thos. Taylor,\r\nLondon, 1807, p. 235; Humboldt, “Cosmos,” 1849, Vol. II. p. 695, note).\r\nThe Earth “is said by Plato to be conglobed about the pole, which is\r\nextended through the universe; because she (the Earth) is contained\r\nand compressed about its axis. For the axis also is the pole. And the\r\npole is thus now denominated because the universe revolves about it\r\n... on this account, the pole is said by Plato to be extended through\r\nthe universe, as entirely pervading the centre of the Earth” (“The Six\r\nBooks of Proclus,” Thos. Taylor, London, 1816, Book VII. chap. xxii.\r\npp. 172–173).\r\n\r\n[71] It was for a copy of the valuable works of this popular Arabian\r\nphysician, which he borrowed from “La Faculté de Médecine” of Paris,\r\nthat Louis XI had to deposit in pledge a large quantity of plate and\r\nhad, besides, to procure a nobleman to join him as surety in a Deed\r\nbinding himself under great forfeiture to restore these extraordinarily\r\nscarce books (Gabr. Naudé, “Additions à l’histoire de Louis XI,” par\r\nComines, Vol. IV. p. 281). Rhazès was born and brought up at Rai,\r\nthe most northern town of Irak Ajemi, where he is said to have died\r\nA.D. 923 or 932 (“Engl.

Jones, fellow of King’s College, Cambridge” (“Dict. of Nat.\r\nBiogr.,” Vol. XXXIX. p. 194).\r\n\r\n[76] These volumes, IV and V, are generally adopted, instead of those\r\nby Benjamin Motte, “a printer who had issued a bad abridgment of the\r\nsame portion” before that of Henry Jones (“Dict. Nat.
