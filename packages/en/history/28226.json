It is based\r\nchiefly on the records of the Air Ministry collected and preserved at\r\nthe Historical Section. The staff of the Section have spared no trouble\r\nto collect an immense amount of material and arrange it for use, to\r\nconsult living witnesses, to verify facts down to the minutest details,\r\nand to correct any errors that may have crept into the narrative. Their\r\nmain purpose has been to secure that any statement of fact made in this\r\nbook shall be true and demonstrable. If in any particular instances they\r\nhave failed in this purpose, it has not been for lack of pains and care.\r\n\r\nOfficial records do not in themselves make history. They are colourless\r\nand bare. In the business of interpreting and supplementing them we have\r\nbeen much helped by the kindness of many military and naval officers and\r\nof many civilian experts. Their help, most of which is acknowledged in\r\nthe text, has supplied us with the liveliest things in this book. We\r\ncould wish that we had more of it. Naval and military officers do not\r\nadvertise, and are reluctant to speak publicly of the part that they\r\nplayed in the war. They are silent on all that may seem to tell to their\r\nown credit or to the discredit of others, and this silence easily\r\ndevelops into a fixed habit of reticence. We are the more grateful to\r\nthose who have helped us to a true account by telling of what they saw.\r\nThe best part of the book is yet to come; if the theme is to be worthily\r\ntreated, it must be by the help of those who remember and of those who\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this history has endeavoured to make his narrative\r\nintelligible to those who, like himself, are outsiders, and, with that\r\nend in view, he has avoided, as far as possible, the masonic dialect of\r\nthe services. For the few and cautious opinions that he has expressed he\r\nalone is responsible. In controverted questions, though he has not\r\nalways been careful to conceal his own opinion, he has always tried so\r\nto state the grounds for other opinions that those who hold these other\r\nopinions may think his statement not unfair. If his own opinion is\r\nwrong, the corrective will usually be found near at hand. The position\r\nof an outsider has grave disabilities; if a measure of compensation for\r\nthese disabilities is anywhere to be found, it must be sought in freedom\r\nfrom the heat of partisan zeal and from the narrowness of corporate\r\nloyalty.\r\n\r\nSome of the men who early took thought for their country's need, and\r\nquietly laboured to prepare her against the day of trial, are here\r\ncelebrated, and their names, we hope, rescued from neglect. The men who\r\nflew over the fire of enemy guns were so many that comparatively few of\r\ntheir names, and these chosen almost by accident, can here be mentioned.\r\nThere were thousands of others just as good. The heroes of this story,\r\nlet it be said once and for all, are only samples.\r\n\r\nSome apology perhaps is necessary for the variety which has been found\r\ninevitable in naming particular men. A man's christian name and surname\r\nare his own, but change and promotion were rapid during the war, so that\r\nthe prefixes to these names varied from year to year. Where we are\r\ndescribing a particular deed, we give the actors the rank that they held\r\nat the time. Where we speak more generally, we give them the rank that\r\nthey held when this history was written.\r\n\r\n                                        WALTER RALEIGH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTION                                                pp. 1-14\r\n\r\nNew means of warfare in the Great War--submarines and aircraft.

How the air will come into its\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Great Britain declared war upon Germany in August 1914, she staked\r\nher very existence as a free nation upon an incalculable adventure. Two\r\nnew means and modes of warfare, both of recent invention, enormously\r\nincreased the difficulties of forecast and seemed to make precedents\r\nuseless. Former wars had been waged on the land and on the sea; the\r\ndevelopment of submarines and aircraft opened up secret ways of travel\r\nfor armed vessels under the sea and promised almost unlimited\r\npossibilities of observation and offence from the heights of the air.\r\n\r\nOf these two new weapons the submarine was brought earlier to a state of\r\nwar efficiency, and because it seemed to threaten the security of our\r\nisland and the power of our navy, it excited the greater apprehension.\r\nBut the navigation of the air, whether by airship or aeroplane, is now\r\nrecognized for the more formidable novelty. The progress of the war has\r\nproved that within the narrow seas the submarine can be countered, and\r\nthat the extension of its capabilities on the high seas is beset with\r\ndifficulties. For aircraft the possibilities are immense. It is not\r\nextravagant to say that the 17th of December 1903, when the Wright\r\nbrothers made the first free flight through the air in a power-driven\r\nmachine, marks the beginning of a new era in the history of the world.\r\n\r\nThe differences to be looked for in this new era were both\r\nover-estimated and under-estimated, according to the temper of those who\r\nconsidered them. Imaginative people, and sentimental people, looked for\r\nthe speedy fulfilment of Tennyson's vision:\r\n\r\n  For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,\r\n  Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;\r\n  Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,\r\n  Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales;\r\n  Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rain'd a ghastly dew\r\n  From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue;\r\n  Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm,\r\n  With the standards of the peoples plunging thro' the thunder-storm;\r\n  Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer, and the battle-flags were furl'd\r\n  In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the World.\r\n\r\nThe Germans, who as a people fall easy victims to agreeable sentiment,\r\nindulged extravagant hopes from war in the air, and expected great\r\nachievements from their Zeppelins. On the other hand, the English, who\r\nare less excitable, were comparatively slow as a nation to appreciate\r\nthe importance of the new invention. Conservative and humorous minds are\r\nalways conscious chiefly of the immutable and stable elements in human\r\nlife, and do not readily pay respect to novelty. Those who were\r\nresponsible for the naval and military defences of the country preserved\r\ngreat coolness, and refused to let judgement outrun experience. They\r\nknew well that the addition to man's resources of yet another mode of\r\ntravel or transport does not alter the enduring principles of strategy.\r\nThey regarded the experiment benevolently, and, after a time, were\r\nwilling to encourage it, but 'up to the end of the year 1911', says an\r\nofficial report, 'the policy of the Government with regard to all\r\nbranches of aerial navigation was based on a desire to keep in touch\r\nwith the movement rather than to hasten its development. It was felt\r\nthat we stood to gain nothing by forcing a means of warfare which tended\r\nto reduce the value of our insular position and the protection of our\r\nsea-power.' When the Wright brothers offered to sell their invention to\r\nthe British Admiralty, the offer was refused.\r\n\r\nIt is natural enough that believers in the new art, who devoted years of\r\ndisinterested thought and labour to getting it recognized, and who truly\r\nforesaw its enormous importance, should be impatient of so cautious an\r\nattitude. But the attitude itself was also natural and excusable. The\r\nBritish navy is a great trust, responsible not so much for the progress\r\nof the nation as for its very existence. Untried courses, new\r\ninvestments, brilliant chances, do not commend themselves to trustees.\r\nBy adherence to a tried policy and to accustomed weapons the navy had\r\nridden out many a storm that threatened national wreckage; what it had\r\ndone so often it believed that it could do again; and it was slow to\r\ngrasp at new weapons before their value was proved. So the progress of\r\naerial science followed what, in this country, is the normal course. We\r\nhave had many great poets and many great inventors. We sometimes starve\r\nour poets, but we make classics of their works. We sometimes leave our\r\ninventors to struggle unaided with difficulties, but when they succeed\r\nwe adopt their inventions as part of the national inheritance, and pay\r\nto their names a respect greater than bounty-fed dependence can ever\r\ncommand or deserve. Their failures are their own, their successes\r\nbelong to their country; and if success brings them no other reward,\r\nthey can at least claim a part in the honour universally paid to\r\nsoldiers and sailors, whose profession is sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it became clear that no nation could without extreme peril to\r\nitself neglect the new weapon, the Government took up the problem in\r\nearnest. Private enterprise might, no doubt, have been trusted to\r\nimprove and develop aircraft for the various uses of peace, but the\r\nquestion was a question of war. The purposes and ambitions of the German\r\nEmpire had again and again been freely expressed, in no moderate\r\nlanguage, and the German menace lay like a long vague shadow across the\r\npeace of Europe. Peaceful citizens, with many other things to think of,\r\nmight fail to see it, but no such blindness was possible for those who\r\nhad charge of the defences of the country. The Committee of Imperial\r\nDefence, in the few years before the war, took expert advice. The\r\nGovernment, acting on this advice, furnished us with the nucleus of an\r\nair force. They made their own flying school, and established their own\r\nfactory for the output of aircraft. They organized an air service with\r\nnaval and military wings. They formed advisory and consultative\r\ncommittees to grapple with the difficulties of organization and\r\nconstruction. They investigated the comparative merits and drawbacks of\r\nairships and aeroplanes. The airships, because they seemed fitter for\r\nreconnaissance over the sea, were eventually assigned wholly to the\r\nNaval Wing. No very swift progress was made with these in the years\r\nbefore the war. The expenses of adequate experiment were enormous, and\r\nthe long tale of mishaps to Zeppelins seemed to show that the risks were\r\ngreat. The experts who were consulted pointed out that the only way to\r\ntest the value of the larger type of airship was to build such airships\r\nourselves, that Germany had patiently persevered in her airship policy\r\nin the face of disaster and loss, and that if we were to succeed with\r\nairships it would be necessary to warn the public that heavy losses, in\r\nthe initial stage, were unavoidable. Opinion in this island, it is right\r\nto remember, was strong against the airship, or gas-bag, and Germany's\r\nenthusiastic championship of the Zeppelin made the aeroplane more\r\npopular in England. So our airship policy was tentative and\r\nexperimental; a few small airships were in use, but none of the large\r\nsize and wide range required for effective naval reconnaissance. Good\r\nand rapid progress, on the other hand, was made with aeroplanes and\r\nseaplanes, and when war broke out we had a small but healthy service,\r\nboth naval and military, ready to take the air.\r\n\r\nFour squadrons of the Military Wing, or Royal Flying Corps, that is to\r\nsay, forty-eight machines, with a few additional machines in reserve,\r\nbore a part in the retreat from Mons. A detachment of the Naval Wing, or\r\nRoyal Naval Air Service, was sent to Belgium, and after bearing a part\r\nin the defence of Antwerp, established itself at Dunkirk, which remained\r\nthroughout the war a centre for aerial operations. These were the\r\nbeginnings; in the four years and three months of the war the air\r\nservice grew and multiplied a hundredfold. At the date of the armistice,\r\nthe 11th of November 1918, there were operating in France and Belgium\r\nninety-nine squadrons of the Royal Air Force. In August 1914 there had\r\nbeen less than two hundred and fifty officers in the service, all told;\r\nin November 1918 there were over thirty thousand. In August 1914 the\r\ntotal of machines, available for immediate war service, was about a\r\nhundred and fifty; in November 1918 there were more than twenty-two\r\nthousand in use, almost all of them enormously more powerful and\r\nefficient than the best machines of the earlier date. In the course of\r\nthe war our air forces accounted for more than eight thousand enemy\r\nmachines; dropped more than eight thousand tons of bombs on enemy\r\nobjectives; fired more than twelve million rounds of ammunition at\r\ntargets on the ground; took more than half a million photographs;\r\nbrought down nearly three hundred enemy balloons; and suffered a total\r\nof casualties not far short of eighteen thousand. Not less important in\r\nits influence on the fortunes of the war than any of these achievements,\r\nperhaps more important than all of them, was the work done by aircraft\r\nin detecting movements of the enemy and in directing the fire of our\r\ngunners upon hostile batteries. This work cannot be exactly assessed or\r\ntabulated, but the German gunner knew where to look for the enemy he\r\nmost dreaded.\r\n\r\nA rapid summary of this kind shows that the history of the war in the\r\nair is inseparable from the history of the development of the art of\r\nflying. Of those who were competent to handle a machine in the air\r\nduring the years before the war by far the greater number served with\r\nthe colours. With the outbreak of war civilian flying, except for\r\ntraining purposes, abruptly ceased. The necessities of war compelled and\r\nquickened invention. When a nation is fighting for its life, money and\r\nenergy are expended without check, and it may be doubted whether in the\r\nwhole history of mankind any art in its infant stage has been so\r\nmagnificently supported and advanced by war as the art of flying was\r\nsupported and advanced by the greatest war of all.\r\n\r\nNo history can be expected to furnish a full record of all the acts of\r\nprowess that were performed in the air during the long course of the\r\nwar. Many of the best of them can never be known; the Victoria Cross has\r\nsurely been earned, over and over again, by pilots and observers who\r\nwent east, and lie in unvisited graves. The public dearly loves a hero;\r\nbut the men who have been both heroic and lucky must share their\r\nhonours, as they are the first to insist, with others whose courage was\r\nnot less, though their luck failed them. There is a quaint system, in\r\nuse in the air service, of reckoning the activities of the service in\r\nterms of hours flown, taking as the unit for addition every single hour\r\nflown by each individual machine. By this method of calculation, the\r\nhours flown by the air service, on all fronts, during the war can be\r\nshown to be much over a million. The work of an ant-hill, reckoned on\r\nthe same basis, would present a stupendous total. If the heroism of the\r\nair service, that is to say, their deeds of surpassing courage and\r\ndevotion, could be thus computed, the figure would run into thousands;\r\nand this would be the fairest, though not the most dramatic, statement\r\nof the case. The officers in command have always been unwilling to pay\r\nregard to 'star turns'; what they have coveted for the service is not a\r\nlow range of achievement rising now and again into sharp fantastic\r\npeaks, but a high tableland of duty and efficiency. They obtained their\r\ndesire, in a result more surprising than any single exploit can ever be.\r\nThey made courage and devotion the rule, not the exception. The work of\r\nthe air service on a war front consists of often-repeated short periods\r\nof intense strain. One pilot described it well by saying that it is like\r\ngoing to the dentist every day. To exact the highest standard of conduct\r\nunder this strain, not as an ideal to be aimed at, but as a working\r\nrule, might well seem to be winding up human nature to a point where it\r\nmust break. The commanders of the air service did not hesitate to take\r\nthe risk. They trusted human nature, and were amply rewarded. The\r\nexperiences of the war revealed, to a generation that had almost\r\nforgotten them, the ancient and majestic powers of man, the power of\r\nhis mind over his body, the power of his duty over his mind. When the\r\nbuilders have been praised for their faith and for their skill, the last\r\nword of wonder and reverence must be kept for the splendid grain of the\r\nstuff that was given them to use in the architecture of their success.\r\n\r\nThose matters are fittest for history which exhibit a process of growth.\r\nThe great periods of human history are not the long periods; they are\r\nthose times of change and crisis when the movements of humanity are\r\nquickened and made visible, when the stationary habits and conservative\r\ntraditions of mankind are broken up, and one phase of civilization gives\r\nplace to another, as the bud, long and slowly matured, suddenly bursts\r\ninto flower. The story of the war in the air is a perfect example of\r\nthis quickening process, whereby developments long secretly prepared,\r\nand delayed until hope is saddened, are mysteriously touched with life,\r\nand exhibit the tendencies of ages condensed in the events of a few\r\ncrowded years. The flying machine, which at the end of the nineteenth\r\ncentury was a toy, ten years later was added to the most valuable\r\nresources of man, and ten years later again bid fair to alter the\r\nconditions of his life on the surface of the earth. The war, though it\r\ndid not cause this great change, accelerated it enormously. War is\r\nexacting, and it is difficult to think of any peaceful uses of aircraft\r\nwhich do not find their counterpart in naval and military operations.\r\nWhen General Townshend was besieged in Kut, there came to him by\r\naeroplane not only food (in quantities sadly insufficient for his\r\nneeds), but salt, saccharine, opium, drugs and surgical dressings,\r\nmails, spare parts for wireless plant, money, and a millstone weighing\r\nseventy pounds, which was dropped by means of a parachute. In the actual\r\noperations of the war the uses of aircraft, and especially of the\r\naeroplane, were very rapidly extended and multiplied. The earliest and\r\nmost obvious use was reconnaissance. To the Commander-in-Chief a\r\ndetailed knowledge of the enemy's dispositions and movements is worth\r\nmore than an additional army corps; aeroplanes and balloons furnished\r\nhim with eyes in the air. As observation was the first purpose of\r\naircraft, so it remains the most important. During the war it was\r\ndeveloped in many directions. The corps machines operating on the\r\nwestern front devoted themselves among other things to detecting enemy\r\nbatteries and to directing the fire of our own artillery. As soon as a\r\nwireless installation for aeroplanes came into use, and the observer was\r\nthus brought into close touch with his own gunners, this kind of\r\nobservation became deadly in its efficiency, and was the chief agent in\r\ndefeating the German scheme of victory by gun-power. When once a hostile\r\nbattery was located, and our guns, by the aid of observation from the\r\nair, were ranged upon it, the fire of that battery was quickly silenced.\r\nOther branches of observation, developed during the war, were\r\nphotography from the air and contact patrol. Complete photographic maps\r\nof Hun-land, as the territory lying immediately behind the enemy lines\r\nwas everywhere called, were made from a mosaic of photographs, and were\r\ncontinually renewed. No changes, however slight, in the surface of the\r\nsoil could escape the record of the camera when read by the aid of a\r\nmagnifying glass. Contact patrol, or reports by low-flying aeroplanes on\r\nthe exact position of the advancing infantry, came later, and\r\nsupplemented the use of the telephone, which was liable to be destroyed\r\nby shell-fire. Our contact patrols saved us from a world of those most\r\ndistressing of casualties, the losses inflicted on troops by their own\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nSerious battle in the air, which was engaged on no large scale until\r\nthe second year of the war, was, in its essence, an attempt to put out\r\nthe eyes of the other side. In the early days officers often took a\r\nrevolver, a carbine, or a rifle, into the air with them, but machines\r\ndesigned expressly for fighting, and armed with Lewis or Vickers guns,\r\ndid not appear in force until it became necessary to counter the attacks\r\nmade by the Fokker on our observation machines. Then began that long\r\nseries of dramatic combats, splendid in many of its episodes, which\r\nfascinated the attention of the public, and almost excluded from notice\r\nthe humbler, but not less essential, and not less dangerous, duties of\r\nthose whose main business it was to observe.\r\n\r\nLastly, the offensive powers of aircraft have been so rapidly developed,\r\nespecially during the latest period of the war, that it was only the\r\ncoming of the armistice that saved mankind from a hurricane of\r\nslaughter. In 1914 a few small bombs were carried by officers into the\r\nair, and were gingerly dropped over the side of the machine. Accuracy of\r\naim was impossible. In the large modern bombing machine the heavier\r\nbombs weigh almost three-quarters of a ton; they are mechanically\r\nreleased from the rack on which they are hung, and when the machine is\r\nflying level, at a known pace and height, good practice can be made, by\r\nthe aid of an adjustable instrument, on any target. Even more desolating\r\nin its effect is the work done by low-flying aeroplanes, armed with\r\nmachine-guns, against enemy troops on the march. Raids on the enemy\r\ncommunications, for the destruction of supplies and the cutting off of\r\nreinforcements, played a great part in the later phases of the war; and\r\nlong-distance raids over enemy centres served to bring the civil\r\npopulation into sympathy with the sufferings of the army.\r\n\r\nAll these activities belong to war on the land, and the aeroplanes of\r\nthe Royal Naval Air Service bore a part in them. Members of the naval\r\nsquadrons at Antwerp carried out the earliest bombing raids into\r\nGermany. The kite balloons, which rose like a palisade behind our lines\r\nand kept the enemy under observation, were, in the early time of the\r\nwar, supplied by the navy. Moreover, the navy had work of its own to do\r\nin the air. The business of coast defence and patrol, the convoy of\r\nvessels--in short, all the office-work that would fall to an\r\nInspector-General of the Seven Seas had to be done by the navy. The\r\nseaplane and the flying boat can come to rest on the surface of the sea,\r\nbut it is no secret that they are not always comfortable there, and\r\nthere were attached to the Naval Air Service certain special vessels,\r\nconstructed or adapted to be seaplane-carriers. The credit of defeating\r\nGermany's submarine campaign belongs, in part at least, to the air\r\nservice, working in co-operation with the destroyers and a swarm of\r\nsmaller craft. In favourable weather submarines below the surface of the\r\nwater can sometimes be seen from the air, and the depth-charge, another\r\ninvention of the war, dropped by surface craft, is the means of their\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nAn occasional duty of aircraft may fitly be mentioned here. It is\r\nsometimes desirable that a missionary should be deposited at a quiet\r\nspot behind the enemy lines, and when he wishes to communicate with\r\nthose who sent him out it sometimes becomes necessary to supply him with\r\na basket of pigeons. When communication is interrupted on the troubled\r\nsurface of the earth, it can often be renewed in the air.\r\n\r\nAs the uses of aircraft multiplied, so did their designs, and where many\r\nvarious tasks were performed, in the beginning of the war, by a single\r\ntype of machine, good in its day, there are now many types of machine,\r\neach with special fitness for its own purpose. How far these\r\ndevelopments may yet go, no man can tell, and prophecy is idle; what is\r\ncertain is that many operations of war and peace which have never yet\r\nbeen performed are within the reach of the aircraft that are now at our\r\ndisposal. A beleaguered city could be victualled. A force of a thousand\r\nmen, with rations and ammunition, could be landed, in a few hours, to\r\noperate in the rear of an invading army. But the world is tired of war,\r\nand the advances of the immediate future will rather be made in the\r\ndirection of peaceful traffic and peaceful communication.\r\n\r\nThe history of the war in the air is the history of the rapid progress\r\nof an art and the great achievements of a service. In the nature of\r\nthings the progress of the art must claim a share in the record. If the\r\nbattle of Trafalgar had been fought only some ten short years after the\r\nfirst adventurer trusted himself to the sea on a crazy raft, the ships,\r\nrather than the men, would be the heroes of that battle, and Nelson\r\nhimself would be overshadowed by the _Victory_. The men who fought the\r\nwar in the air have overcome more than their enemies; they, and those\r\nwho worked for them on the ground, have successfully grappled with\r\nproblem after problem in the perfecting of the art of flight. A whole\r\nworld of scientific devices, from the Pitot tube, which indicates the\r\nspeed of the machine through the air, to the Dreyer automatic oxygen\r\napparatus, which enables the pilot to breathe in the rarefied upper\r\nreaches of the atmosphere and to travel far above the summit of high\r\nmountain ranges, has become a part of daily usage. A machine is the\r\nembodiment of human thought, and if it sometimes seems to be almost\r\nalive, that is because it springs of live parents. The men of science,\r\nwho worked for humanity, must have an honour only less than the honour\r\npaid to the men of action, who died for their country. These last, the\r\npilots and observers who are dead and gone, would not ask to be exalted\r\nabove other branches of the fighting services. Their pride was to serve\r\nthe army on the land and the navy on the sea. The men who march often\r\nadmire and extol the courage of the men who fly, and they are right; but\r\nthe men who fly, unless they are very thoughtless, know that the\r\nheaviest burden of war, its squalor and its tediousness, is borne on the\r\ndevoted shoulders of the infantryman. All other arms, even ships of war\r\nthemselves, in many of their uses, are subservient to the infantry. Man\r\nmust live, and walk, and sleep on the surface of the earth, and there,\r\nin the few feet of soil that have been fertilized by contact with the\r\nair, he must grow his food. These are the permanent conditions, and they\r\ngive the infantry its supremacy in war. A country that is conquered must\r\nbe controlled and administered; a city that surrenders must be occupied.\r\nBattles can be won in the air or on the sea, and the mark of victory is\r\nthis, that the patient infantry, military and civil, can then advance,\r\nto organize peace. An immense sympathy for the sufferings of the\r\ninfantry, an immense admiration for their dogged perseverance in their\r\nnever-ending task, is felt by all those whose business it is to assist\r\nthem from the air. It would be an ill service to the men of the air\r\nforce, and a foolish ambition, to try to raise them in consideration\r\nabove the heads of the men whose servants and helpers they are.\r\n\r\nThere is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon. The air\r\nservice has its own advantages, its own trials, and its own marks of\r\ndistinction. Life in the service was lived at high pressure, and was\r\ncommonly short. Throughout the war our machines were continually at work\r\nover enemy territory, but the pilots of the beginning of the war were\r\nnot crossing the lines at its close. A few were acting in administrative\r\nposts; some had returned, disabled, to civil life; the rest have\r\npassed, and their work has been carried on by generation after\r\ngeneration of their successors. The air service still flourishes; its\r\nhealth depends on a secret elixir of immortality, which enables a body\r\nto repair its severest losses. The name of this elixir is tradition, and\r\nthe greatest of all the achievements of the air service is that in a\r\nvery few years, under the hammer of war, it has fashioned and welded its\r\ntradition, and has made it sure. Critics who speak of what they have not\r\nfelt and do not know have sometimes blamed the air service because,\r\nbeing young, it has not the decorum of age. The Latin poet said that it\r\nis decorous to die for one's country; in that decorum the service is\r\nperfectly instructed. But those who meet the members of a squadron in\r\ntheir hours of ease, among gramophones and pictorial works of art\r\nsuggestive of luxury, forget that an actor in a tragedy, though he play\r\nhis part nobly on the stage, is not commonly tragic in the green-room.\r\nIf they desire intensity and gravity, let them follow the pilot out on\r\nto the aerodrome, and watch his face in its hood, when the chocks are\r\npulled away, and he opens the throttle of the engine. No Greek sculpture\r\nis finer in its rendering of life and purpose. To see him at his best\r\nthey would have to accompany him, through the storm of the anti-aircraft\r\nguns, into those fields of air where every moment brings some new trial\r\nof the quickness of his brain and the steadiness of his nerve. He is now\r\nin the workshop where tradition is made, to be handed down as an\r\nheirloom to the coming generations. It will not fail to reach them. The\r\nRoyal Air Force is strong in the kind of virtue that propagates itself\r\nand attains to a life beyond a life. The tradition is safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF THE AIR\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know next to nothing of man's greatest achievements. His written\r\nhistory is the history of yesterday, and leaves him very much the same\r\nbeing as it finds him, with the same habits, the same prejudices, and\r\nonly slightly enhanced powers. The greatest and most significant\r\nadvances were prehistoric. What invention, of which any record remains,\r\ncan compare in importance with the invention of speech; and what day in\r\nthe world's history is more worthy of celebration than that day, the\r\nbirthday of thought and truth, when a sound, uttered by the breath, from\r\nbeing the expression of a feeling became the mark of a thing? The man\r\nwho first embarked on the sea has been praised for the triple armour of\r\nhis courage; but he must be content with praise; his biography will\r\nnever be written. The North American Indians are reckoned a primitive\r\npeople, but when first they come under the notice of history they bring\r\nwith them one of the most perfect of human inventions--the birch-bark\r\ncanoe. What centuries of dreams and struggles and rash adventures went\r\nto the inventing and perfecting of that frail boat? What forgotten names\r\ndeserve honour for the invention of the paddle and the sail? The whole\r\nstory is beyond recovery in the rapidly closing backward perspective of\r\ntime. Man's eyes are set in his head so that he may go forward, and\r\nwhile he is healthy and alert he does not trouble to look behind him. If\r\nthe beginnings of European civilization are rightly traced to certain\r\ntribes of amphibious dwellers on the coast of the Mediterranean, who\r\nreared the piles of their houses in the water, and so escaped the\r\ngreater perils of the land, then some sort of rudimentary navigation was\r\nthe first condition of human progress, and sea-power, which defies the\r\ndevastators of continents, had earlier prophets than Admiral Mahan. But\r\nthe memory of these thousands of years has passed like a watch in the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of the sea can never be recorded in history; even the\r\nconquest of the air, which was achieved within the lifetime of all but\r\nthe very youngest of those who are now alive, admits of no sure or\r\nperfect record. The men who bore a part in it, and still survive, are\r\npreoccupied with the future, and are most of them impatient of their own\r\npast. Where knowledge begins, there begin also conflicting testimonies\r\nand competing claims. It is no part of the business of this history of\r\nthe war in the air to compare these testimonies or to resolve these\r\nclaims. To narrate how man learned to fly would demand a whole treatise,\r\nand the part of the history which ends in December 1903 is the most\r\ndifficult and uncertain part of all. Yet the broad outlines of the\r\nprocess can be sketched and determined. It is a long story of legends\r\nand dreams, theories and fancies, all suddenly transformed into facts; a\r\ntale of the hopes of madmen suddenly recognized as reasonable ambitions.\r\nWhen in the light of the present we look back on the past our eyes are\r\nopened, and we see many things that were invisible to contemporaries. We\r\nare able, for the first time, to pay homage to the pioneers, who saw the\r\npromised kingdom, but did not enter it. No place has hitherto been found\r\nfor their names in serious history. _The Dictionary of National\r\nBiography_, with its supplement, includes the lives of all the famous\r\nmen of this nation who died before King George the Fifth was king. Yet\r\nit contains no mention of Sir George Cayley, the Father of British\r\nAeronautics; nor of John Stringfellow, who, in 1848, constructed the\r\nfirst engine-driven aeroplane that ever flew through the air; nor of\r\nFrancis Herbert Wenham, whose classic treatise on Aerial Locomotion,\r\nread at the first meeting of the Aeronautical Society, in 1866, expounds\r\nalmost every principle on which modern aviation is founded; nor of James\r\nGlaisher, who, in 1862; made the highest recorded balloon ascent; nor of\r\nPercy Sinclair Pilcher, who lost his life in experimenting with one of\r\nhis own gliders in 1899. These men attracted little enough notice in\r\ntheir own day, and were regarded as amiable eccentrics; but they all\r\nthought long and hard on aerial navigation, and step by step, at their\r\nown costs, they brought it nearer to accomplishment.\r\n\r\nNow that the thing has been done, it seems strange that it was not done\r\nearlier. At no time was it possible for man to forget his disabilities;\r\nthe birds were always above him, in easy possession. If he attributed\r\ntheir special powers wholly to the lightness of their structure and the\r\nstrength of their muscles, the variety of flying creatures might have\r\ntaught him better. The fact is that there is no unique design for\r\nflight; given the power and its right use, almost anything can fly. If\r\nthe sea-gull can fly, so can the duck, with a much heavier body and a\r\nmuch less proportion of wing. The moth can fly; but so can the beetle.\r\nThe flying-fish can fly, or rather, can leap into the air and glide for\r\na distance of many yards. With the requisite engine-power a portmanteau\r\nor a tea-tray could support itself in the air. The muscular power of\r\nman, it is now generally accepted, is not sufficient to support his\r\nweight in level flight on still air, but if the principles of flight had\r\nbeen understood, there was no need to wait for the invention of the\r\npowerful internal-combustion engine; a steam-engine in a well-designed\r\naeroplane might have performed very useful flights. It was knowledge\r\nthat lingered. Newton, when he saw an apple fall in his garden at\r\nWoolsthorpe, 'began to think of gravity extending to the orb of the\r\nmoon'. If he had been in the habit of skimming flat stones on calm\r\nwater, he might have bent his mind to the problem of flight, and might\r\neven have anticipated some of the discoveries in aerodynamics which were\r\nreserved for the last century--in particular, the relations of speed and\r\nangle of incidence to the reactions of air resistance on a moving plane.\r\nThe fact which is the basis of all aeroplane flight is that a perfectly\r\nhorizontal plane, free to fall through the air, has its time of falling\r\nmuch retarded if it is in rapid horizontal motion. This is what makes\r\ngliding possible. Now let the plane which is being propelled in a\r\nhorizontal direction be slightly tilted up, so that its front, or\r\nleading edge, is higher than its back, or trailing edge. The reaction of\r\nthe air can then be resolved into two components, technically called\r\n'lift' and 'drag'; lift, which tends to raise the plane, and drag, which\r\nretards it in its forward motion. When the angle of incidence of the\r\nplane is small, that is, when it is only slightly tilted from its\r\ndirection of motion, the greater part of the air reaction is converted\r\ninto lift. This is what makes flying possible. A moderate speed through\r\nthe air will enable the plane to lift much more than its own weight.\r\n\r\nThis is not a technical treatise, but some further facts of signal\r\nimportance in the theory and practice of flight are better explained at\r\nonce, in so far as the beautiful exactitude of mathematical\r\ndemonstration can be expressed in the crudities of popular speech. The\r\nlift produced by the reaction of the air acts on the whole plane, but\r\nnot equally on all parts of it. At a flying angle, that is, when the\r\nangle of incidence of the plane is small, the upward force is greatest\r\non those parts of the plane which are immediately behind the leading\r\nedge. The wings of any soaring bird are long and narrow, and thus are\r\nperfectly designed for their work. A square-winged bird would be a poor\r\nsoarer; a bird the breadth of whose wings should be greater than their\r\nlength could hardly fly at all. The wings of a flying machine are called\r\nplanes, or aerofoils; the length of the wing is called the span of the\r\nplane; the breadth of the wing is called the chord of the plane. The\r\nproportion of the span to the chord, that is, the proportion of the\r\nlength of the wing to its breadth, is called the 'aspect ratio' of the\r\nplane; and a plane, or wing, that is long and narrow is said to have a\r\nhigh aspect ratio. A higher aspect ratio than is found in any bird or\r\nany flying machine would theoretically improve its powers of flight, but\r\nthe practicable span of the plane, or length of the wing, is limited by\r\nthe need for rigidity and strength. The albatross, nevertheless, the\r\nking of soaring birds, has enormously long and narrow wings; and the\r\nplanes of some flying machines have an aspect ratio almost as high as\r\nthe slats of a Venetian blind.\r\n\r\nThe wings of a flying machine, it has been said, are called planes, but\r\nthey are not true planes. Like the wings of a bird, they are 'cambered',\r\nthat is to say, they curve upward from the leading edge and downward\r\nagain to the trailing edge. Some of the most valuable work contributed\r\nby the laboratory to the science of flight has had for its object the\r\ndetermination of the best form of camber, or curve of the plane. In the\r\nresult, that form of camber has been found to be best which attains its\r\nmaximum depth a little way only behind the leading edge, and gradually\r\nbecomes shallower towards the trailing edge. Such a form of curve\r\nproduces a comparatively smooth and untroubled partial vacuum above the\r\nplane, just behind its leading edge, and this vacuum is the factor of\r\nchief importance in the lift of the plane.\r\n\r\nThe above is a brief and rough statement of some principles of aviation\r\nwhich have been ascertained by long experiment and the labour of many\r\nminds. It is by experiment that flight has been achieved. The Newton\r\nwho shall reduce all the observed phenomena to a few broad and simple\r\nlaws is yet to come. A bird is simpler than an aeroplane in that its\r\nwings both support it and drive it forward, whereas all aerial machines,\r\nboth those that are heavier than air and those that are lighter than\r\nair, are at present driven forward by the thrust of an airscrew,\r\nrevolving at the rate of some twenty to thirty times a second.\r\n\r\nThere are only two kinds of flying machine, the lighter than air and the\r\nheavier than air, of which two kinds the simplest types are the\r\nsoap-bubble and the arrow. These two kinds have often been in\r\ncompetition with each other; and their rivalry, which has sometimes\r\ndelayed progress, still continues. The chief practical objection to\r\nmachines lighter than air is that they are buoyed up by vulnerable\r\nreceptacles containing hydrogen or some other highly inflammable gas. As\r\nsoon as helium, which is a light non-inflammable gas, shall be produced\r\nin quantity at a reasonable expense, this objection will be lessened.\r\nThe advantage of the lighter-than-air, or floating, machine over the\r\nheavier-than-air, or soaring, machine is that it can remain stationary\r\nin the air without loss of height, and that its great size and lifting\r\npower enable it to supply comfortable quarters for its staff, who not\r\nonly travel in it, but, if need be, can inhabit it for days. The airship\r\nhas a promising future, but it can never wholly supersede the soaring\r\nmachine, which is heavier than air, and flies as birds fly.\r\n\r\nA fascinating story, part legend, part fiction, might be told of the\r\nearliest reputed inventors. The fable of Daedalus perhaps grew up round\r\nthe memory of a man of mechanical genius, for Daedalus was the author of\r\nmany inventions before he flew from Crete to Italy. Aulus Gellius, in\r\nhis entertaining book of anecdotes called the _Attic Nights_, tells how\r\nthe philosopher Archytas of Tarentum invented a mechanical pigeon,\r\nwhich was filled with some kind of light air, and flew. The two schools\r\nof aeronautics were here reconciled. Other mechanists were Roger Bacon,\r\nwho is reported to have designed a flying chariot; and Regiomontanus,\r\nastronomer and mathematician, who made a mechanical eagle which flew to\r\nmeet the Emperor Charles the Fifth, on his solemn entry into the city of\r\nNuremberg. It is not necessary to inquire whether these stories are true\r\nor false; what is certain is that the inventors did not leave their\r\ninventions as a legacy to their fellows. For a like reason Leonardo da\r\nVinci, who busied himself with a mechanism which should enable man to\r\noperate wings with his legs, and who left a short treatise on the art of\r\nflight, has no place in the history. His mechanism is merely a drawing;\r\nhis treatise remained in manuscript. The adventurers who risked their\r\nlives on wings of their own making are truer ancestors of the flying\r\nman. In 1507 John Damian, who was held in esteem as an alchemist and\r\nphysician at the court of King James IV of Scotland, 'took in hand to\r\nfly with wings, and to that effect he caused make a pair of wings of\r\nfeathers, which being fastened upon him, he flew off the castle wall of\r\nStirling, but shortly he fell to the ground and brake his\r\nthigh-bone'.[1] The poet Dunbar attacked him in a satirical poem, and\r\nthe reputation of a charlatan has stuck to him, but he deserves credit\r\nfor his courageous attempt. So does the Marquis de Bacqueville, who, in\r\n1742, attached to his arms and legs planes of his own design, and\r\nlaunched himself from an upper story of his house in Paris, in the\r\nattempt to fly across the river Seine to the Tuileries, about two\r\nhundred yards away. He glided some distance, and then fell on a\r\nwasherwoman's barge in the stream, breaking his leg in the fall. These\r\nand other disastrous attempts might be defended in the words of Wilbur\r\nWright, written in 1901, while he was experimenting with his own\r\ngliders. 'There are two ways', he says, 'of learning how to ride a\r\nfractious horse: one is to get on him and learn by actual practice how\r\neach motion and trick may be best met; the other is to sit on a fence\r\nand watch the beast awhile, and then retire to the house and at leisure\r\nfigure out the best way of overcoming his jumps and kicks. The latter\r\nsystem is the safest; but the former, on the whole, turns out the larger\r\nproportion of good riders. It is very much the same in learning to ride\r\na flying machine; if you are looking for perfect safety you will do well\r\nto sit on a fence and watch the birds; but if you really wish to learn\r\nyou must mount a machine and become acquainted with its tricks by actual\r\ntrial.'[2] This pronouncement, by the highest authority, may serve as an\r\napology for some of those whose attempts were reckoned madness or\r\nquackery, and whose misfortunes, during many long centuries, are the\r\nonly material available for the history of human flight.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: From the _History of Scotland_, by John Lesley, Bishop\r\n    of Ross, written about 1570.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: _Journal of the Western Society of Engineers_, vol. vi,\r\n    No. 6, December 1901.]\r\n\r\nTwo periods of modern European history are notable for a quickening of\r\nhuman interest in the problem of aerial navigation. They are the age of\r\nLouis XIV of France, and the age of the French Revolution. Both were\r\ntimes of great progress in science, and of illimitable hopes; but the\r\nearlier period, which in England witnessed the foundation of the Royal\r\nSociety, was notable chiefly for advance in the physical and\r\nmathematical sciences; while the later period was more addicted to\r\nchemistry, and was the age of Lavoisier, Priestley, Cavendish, and\r\nBlack. The former age, though it attained to nothing practical, made\r\nsome progress in the theory of flight; the latter age invented the\r\nballoon.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society took its origin in the meetings in London, during the\r\ntroublous times of the Civil War, of 'divers worthy persons inquisitive\r\ninto natural philosophy'. One of these worthy persons was John Wilkins,\r\nmathematician, philosopher, and divine, who, being parliamentarian in\r\nhis sympathies, was, on the expulsion of the Royalists from Oxford, made\r\nWarden of Wadham College in that University. At Wadham, in the Warden's\r\nlodgings, the 'Experimental philosophical Club', as Aubrey calls it,\r\nrenewed its meetings. Sprat, the early historian of the Royal Society,\r\nexplains that religion and politics were forbidden topics. 'To have been\r\nalways tossing about some theological question would have been to make\r\nthat their private diversion of which they had had more than enough in\r\npublic; to have been musing on the Civil Wars would have made them\r\nmelancholy; therefore Nature alone could entertain them.' After the\r\nRestoration a meeting was held at Gresham College in London, and a\r\ncommittee was appointed, with Wilkins as chairman, to draw up a scheme\r\nfor the Royal Society. The King approved of the scheme submitted to him,\r\nand the society received its charter in 1662.\r\n\r\nWilkins was a famous man in his day; he married a sister of Oliver\r\nCromwell, and in his later years was Bishop of Chester. But his great\r\nwork was the founding of the Royal Society; and his philosophical (or,\r\nas they would now be called, scientific) writings, which belong to his\r\nearlier years in London, show very clearly with what high expectations\r\nthe society started on its labours. The first of these writings,\r\npublished in 1638, is a discourse to prove that there may be another\r\nhabitable World in the Moon. The second considers the possibility of a\r\npassage thither. The third maintains that it is probable that our Earth\r\nis one of the planets. The fourth, which is entitled _Mercury; or, the\r\nSecret Messenger_, discusses how thoughts may be communicated from a\r\ndistance. The fifth and last, published in 1648, is called _Mathematical\r\nMagic_, and is divided into two books, under the titles _Archimedes; or,\r\nMechanical Powers_, and _Daedalus; or, Mechanical Motions_. In this\r\nlatter book Wilkins treats of mills, clocks, and the contrivance of\r\nmotion by rarefied air; of the construction of an ark for submarine\r\nnavigation, and of its uses in war; of a sailing chariot, to be driven\r\non the land as ships are on the sea; of the possibility of perpetual\r\nmotion; and, in chapters vii and viii, of the art of flying. There are\r\nfour ways, according to Wilkins, whereby flying in the air may be\r\nattempted. The first is by spirits or angels; but this branch of the\r\nsubject does not belong to natural philosophy. The next is by the help\r\nof fowls, which the learned Francis Bacon thought deserving of further\r\nexperiment. Two ways remain of flying by our own strength; we may use\r\nwings fastened immediately to the body, or we may devise a flying\r\nchariot. If we are to use wings, he says, we must be brought up in the\r\nconstant practice of them from youth, first 'running on the ground, as\r\nan ostrich or tame goose will do ... and so by degrees learn to rise\r\nhigher.... I have heard it from credible testimony, that one of our own\r\nnation hath proceeded so far in this experiment, that he was able by the\r\nhelp of wings, in such a running pace, to step constantly ten yards at a\r\ntime.' The arms of a man extended are weak, and easily wearied, so he\r\nthinks it would be worth the inquiry whether the wings might not be\r\nworked by the legs being thrust out and drawn in again one after the\r\nother, so as each leg should move both wings. But the best way of flying\r\nwould be by a flying chariot, big enough to carry several persons, who\r\nmight take turns to work it. Wilkins is quite honest in recognizing the\r\ndifficulties of this scheme. He deals fully with the chief of\r\nthem--whether so large and heavy a machine can be supported by so thin\r\nand light a body as the air; and whether the strength of the persons in\r\nit can be sufficient for the motion of it. In his attempt to show that\r\nthese objections are not insuperable, he makes some true remarks. He had\r\nwatched soaring birds, and had seen how they could swim up and down in\r\nthe air without any sensible motion of the wings. When the right\r\nproportions of the machine are found out, and men by long practice have\r\nattained to skill and experience, we may perhaps, he thinks, be able to\r\nimitate the birds. If, after all, it be found that some greater motive\r\npower is required, we must not despair of the invention of such a power.\r\nThe main difficulty will be not so much in maintaining the machine in\r\nflight as in raising it from the ground. 'When once it is aloft in the\r\nair, the motion of it will be easy, as it is in the flight of all kind\r\nof birds, which being at any great distance from the earth, are able to\r\ncontinue their motion for a long time and way, with little labour and\r\nweariness.' The right proportion of the wings, both for length and\r\nbreadth; the special contrivances necessary for ascent, descent, or a\r\nturning motion--these and many more such questions can only be resolved,\r\nhe maintains, by particular experiments. The sails of ships have been\r\nperfected by degrees, and the attempt to fly must meet with many\r\ndifficulties and inconveniences for which only long experience and\r\nfrequent trial can suggest a remedy.\r\n\r\nSo far Wilkins went; and he went no farther. His speculations, however,\r\nmade a deep impression on his own age, gave a bias to the researches of\r\nhis fellows, and, incidentally, aroused a storm of ridicule. When Joseph\r\nGlanvill, in his vigorous little treatise called _Scepsis Scientifica_\r\n(1665), wrote a forecast of the possible achievements of the Royal\r\nSociety, he borrowed his hopes from Wilkins. 'Should these heroes go\r\non', he says, 'as they have happily begun, they will fill the world\r\nwith wonders, and posterity will find many things that are now but\r\nrumours, verified into practical realities. It may be, some ages hence,\r\na voyage to the southern unknown tracts, yea, possibly the Moon, will\r\nnot be more strange than one to America. To them that come after us it\r\nmay be as ordinary to buy a pair of wings to fly into remotest regions,\r\nas now a pair of boots to ride a journey. And to confer at the distance\r\nof the Indies, by sympathetic conveyances, may be as usual to future\r\ntimes, as to us in a literary correspondence. The restoration of grey\r\nhairs to juvenility, and renewing the exhausted marrow, may at length be\r\neffected without a miracle; and the turning the now comparative desert\r\nworld into a paradise, may not improbably be expected from late\r\nagriculture.' Again, when Sir William Temple, some thirty years later,\r\ncast contempt upon the Moderns in his _Essay of Ancient and Modern\r\nLearning_, it was the speculations of Wilkins that provoked his keenest\r\nsatire. 'I have indeed heard of wondrous Pretensions and Visions of Men,\r\npossess'd with Notions of the strange Advancement of Learning and\r\nSciences, on foot in this Age, and the Progress they are like to make in\r\nthe next; as, the Universal Medicine, which will certainly cure all that\r\nhave it; the Philosopher's Stone, which will be found out by Men that\r\ncare not for Riches: the transfusion of young Blood into old Men's\r\nVeins, which will make them as gamesome as the Lambs, from which 'tis to\r\nbe derived; an Universal Language, which may serve all Men's Turn, when\r\nthey have forgot their own: the Knowledge of one another's Thoughts,\r\nwithout the grievous Trouble of Speaking: the Art of Flying, till a Man\r\nhappens to fall down and break his Neck: Double-bottom'd Ships, whereof\r\nnone can ever be cast away, besides the first that was made: the\r\nadmirable Virtues of that noble and necessary Juice called Spittle,\r\nwhich will come to be sold, and very cheap, in the Apothecaries' Shops:\r\nDiscoveries of new Worlds in the Planets, and Voyages between this and\r\nthat in the Moon, to be made as frequently as between York and London:\r\nwhich such poor Mortals as I am think as wild as those of Ariosto, but\r\nwithout half so much Wit, or so much Instruction; for there, these\r\nmodern Sages may know where they may hope in Time to find their lost\r\nSenses, preserved in Vials, with those of Orlando.'\r\n\r\nBoth Sir William Temple and Joseph Glanvill were men of acute\r\nintelligence and complete sanity; the one an aged statesman deeply\r\nversed in the deceits and follies of men; the other a young cleric,\r\neducated in the Oxford of the Commonwealth, and stirred to enthusiasm by\r\nwhat he had there heard of the progress of natural philosophy. In this\r\nperennial debate the man of the world commonly triumphs; he plays for\r\nthe stakes that are on the table, and does not put faith in deferred\r\ngains. For something like two hundred years Sir William Temple's triumph\r\nwas almost complete. Now things have changed, and Glanvill's rhapsody\r\ncomes nearer to the truth. Wireless telegraphy, radium, the discoveries\r\nof bacteriology, and not least the conquest of the air, have taken the\r\nedge off the sallies of the wit, and have verified the dreams of the\r\nprophet.\r\n\r\nWhat most delayed the science and art of flight, which made no progress\r\nduring the whole of the eighteenth century, was an imperfect\r\nunderstanding of the flight of birds. The right way to achieve flight,\r\nas events were to prove, was by the study and practice of gliding. But\r\nbirds were believed to support, as well as to raise, themselves in the\r\nair chiefly by what in the jargon of science is called orthogonal\r\nflight, that is, by direct downward flapping of the wings. This view\r\nreceived authoritative support from a famous treatise written in the\r\nseventeenth century by Giovanni Alfonso Borelli, an Italian professor of\r\nmathematical and natural philosophy. Borelli, who held professorships at\r\nthe Universities of Florence and Pisa, and corresponded with many\r\nmembers of the Royal Society, was an older man than Wilkins, but his\r\nbook on the movements of animals (_De Motu Animalium_), which included a\r\nsection on the flight of birds (_De Volatu_), was not published till\r\n1680, when both he and Wilkins were dead. It was long held in high\r\nesteem for its anatomical exposition of the action of flying, and some\r\nof its main contentions cast a damp upon the hopes of man. The bones of\r\na bird, says Borelli, are thin tubes of exceeding hardness, much\r\nlighter, and at the same time stronger, than the bones of a man. The\r\npectoral muscles, which move the wings, are massive and strong--more\r\nthan four times stronger, in proportion to the weight they have to move,\r\nthan the legs of a man. And he states his conclusion roundly--it is\r\nimpossible that man should ever achieve artificial flight by his own\r\nstrength. This view, dogmatically stated by one who was a good\r\nmathematician and a good anatomist, became the orthodox view, and had an\r\nenduring influence. All imitation of the birds by man, and further, all\r\nschemes of navigating the air in a machine dynamically supported,\r\nseemed, by Borelli's argument, to have been thrust back into the limbo\r\nof vanities.\r\n\r\nThere remained only the hope that some means might be found of buoying\r\nman up in the air, thereby leaving him free to apply his muscular and\r\nmechanical powers to the business of driving himself forward. Another\r\ncelebrated treatise of the seventeenth century pointed the way to such a\r\nmeans. Francesco Lana, a member of the Society of Jesus in Rome, spent\r\nthe greater part of his life in scientific research. He planned a large\r\nencyclopaedia, embodying all existing science, in so far as it was based\r\non experiment and proof. Of this work only two volumes appeared during\r\nhis lifetime; he died at Brescia in the year 1687. But long before he\r\ndied, he had produced, in 1670, a preliminary sketch of his great work;\r\nand it is this earlier and shorter treatise which contains the two\r\nfamous chapters on the Aerial Ship. The aerial ship is to be buoyed up\r\nin the air by being suspended from four globes, made of thin copper\r\nsheeting, each of them about twenty-five feet in diameter. From these\r\nglobes the air is to be exhausted, so that each of them, being lighter\r\nthan air, will support the weight of two or three men. The ship being\r\nthus floated can be propelled by oars and sails.\r\n\r\nAny modern reader, without asking for further specifications, can\r\npronounce this design absurd. Lana was prevented by his vow of poverty\r\nfrom spending any money on experiment, so that he had to meet only\r\nargumentative objections, not those much more formidable obstacles, the\r\nordeal of the inventor, which present themselves when a machine is\r\ntheoretically perfect and will not work. The difficulties which he\r\nforesaw are real enough. The process of exhausting the air from the\r\nglobes might, he thought, prove troublesome. The pressure of the\r\natmosphere on the outer surface, it might be held, would crush or break\r\nthe globes, to which he replied that that pressure would be equal on all\r\nsides, and would therefore rather strengthen the globes than break them.\r\nThe ship, some might object, could not be propelled by oars; Lana thinks\r\nit could, but suggests, to comfort the objectors, that oars will rarely\r\nbe necessary, for there will always be a wind. The weight of the machine\r\nand of the persons in it will fortunately prevent it from rising to\r\nheights where breathing becomes impossible. 'I do not foresee', says\r\nLana, 'any other difficulties that could prevail against this invention,\r\nsave one only, which to me seems the greatest of them all, and that is\r\nthat God would never surely allow such a machine to be successful,\r\nsince it would create many disturbances in the civil and political\r\ngovernments of mankind. Where is the man who can fail to see that no\r\ncity would be proof against surprise, when the ship could at any time be\r\nsteered over its squares, or even over the courtyards of\r\ndwelling-houses, and brought to earth for the landing of its crew?...\r\nIron weights could be hurled to wreck ships at sea, or they could be set\r\non fire by fireballs and bombs; nor ships alone, but houses, fortresses,\r\nand cities could be thus destroyed, with the certainty that the airship\r\ncould come to no harm as the missiles could be hurled from a vast\r\nheight.'\r\n\r\nThe extravagance of Lana's design must not be allowed to rob him of the\r\ncredit of being, in some sense, the inventor of the balloon. A balloon\r\nfilled with gas, and lighter than air, was in his day inconceivable; the\r\ncomposition of the atmosphere was unknown, and the chemistry of gases\r\nwas not understood. But he had followed the physical investigations of\r\nthe seventeenth century, and was well acquainted with Torricelli's\r\ndemonstration of the weight of the atmosphere. The only practical way\r\nfor him to make a vessel lighter than air was to empty it of the air\r\nwithin it, and Torricelli's invention of the barometer seemed to bring\r\nsuch a device within reach. The common pump begat the barometer; the\r\nbarometer begat the balloon. But the enormous pressure of the atmosphere\r\non a vessel encasing a vacuum, though Lana had triumphed over it in\r\nargument, could not be so easily dealt with in practice. The success of\r\nthe balloon was delayed until, by the discovery and production of a gas\r\nlighter than air, a frail and thin envelope could be supported against\r\nthe pressure from without by an equal pressure from within.\r\n\r\nFor ballooning what was chiefly necessary was a thorough knowledge of\r\ngases and of the means of producing them. The older chemistry, or\r\nalchemy, devoted all its attention, for centuries, to the precious\r\nmetals, and knew nothing of gas. Medical chemistry, which succeeded it,\r\nwas concerned chiefly with the curative properties of various chemical\r\npreparations. When Robert Boyle, and the investigators who came after\r\nhim, put aside this age-long preoccupation with wealth and healing, and\r\nset themselves to determine, by observation and experiment, the nature\r\nof common substances, and the possibility of resolving them into simpler\r\nelements, modern chemistry began. Four states of matter, namely, earth,\r\nair, fire, and water, were recognized by the older chemists, and were by\r\nthem called elements; it was the work of the eighteenth century to\r\ninvestigate these, and especially to separate the constituents of air\r\nand of water. In 1774 Joseph Priestley discovered oxygen. In 1782 Henry\r\nCavendish showed that hydrogen, when burnt, produces water. At a much\r\nearlier date hydrogen had been produced by the action of acid on metals,\r\nand had been found to be many times lighter than air. Dr. Joseph Black,\r\nprofessor of chemistry in the University of Edinburgh, was the first to\r\nsuggest, in 1767, that a balloon inflated with hydrogen would rise in\r\nthe air; and the experiment was successfully tried with soap-bubbles by\r\nTiberius Cavallo, in the year 1782.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the famous first balloon, which ascended in 1783, was not\r\nfilled with hydrogen, and was invented by what may be called a happy\r\naccident. The brothers Joseph and Jacques Montgolfier were the sons of a\r\nwealthy paper-maker at Annonay, not very far from Lyons. The suggestion\r\nof their balloon came to them from observing that thick opaque clouds\r\nfloat high in the air. Linen material was readily accessible to them at\r\nthe factory, and they resolved to try whether a large balloon, some\r\nthirty-three feet in diameter, filled with smoke vapours, would rise in\r\nthe air. Their experiment was successful. On the 5th of June 1783 they\r\nfilled their balloon with smoke (and therefore with hot air) over a fire\r\nof chips and shavings; it rose easily, and travelled to a distance of\r\nabout a mile and a half before it cooled and sank. The fame of this\r\nexperiment quickly reached Paris, the centre of science and fashion, and\r\nawakened rivalry. Under the direction of Professor Charles, a well-known\r\nphysicist, two brothers whose surname was Robert made from varnished\r\nsilk a balloon of about thirteen feet in diameter; it was filled with\r\nhydrogen, and on the 27th of August 1783, in the presence of a large and\r\nexcited assembly, it rose from the Champ de Mars and travelled some\r\nfifteen miles into the country, where it fell, and produced a panic\r\namong the peasantry. On the 19th of September Joseph Montgolfier was\r\nbrought to Versailles to give a demonstration of his new invention in\r\nthe presence of the King and Queen. On this occasion his balloon rose\r\n1,500 feet into the air, carrying with it a sheep, a cock, and a duck,\r\nthe first living passengers, whom it deposited unhurt when it came to\r\nground again after a short flight. Thereafter society went balloon-mad.\r\nPilatre de Rozier, a young native of Metz, determined to attempt an\r\naerial voyage. During the month of October he experimented with a\r\ncaptive balloon of the Montgolfier type, from which he suspended a\r\nbrazier, so that by a continued supply of heated air the balloon should\r\nmaintain its buoyancy. On the 21st of November 1783, accompanied by the\r\nMarquis d'Arlandes, he rose in a free balloon from the Bois de Boulogne,\r\nand made a successful voyage of twenty minutes, during which time he\r\ntravelled over Paris for a distance of about five miles. Ten days later,\r\non behalf of the savants, M. Charles retorted with a voyage of\r\ntwenty-seven miles, in a hydrogen balloon, from Paris to Nesle; he was\r\naccompanied by one of the brothers Robert, and when Robert left the car\r\nat Nesle the balloon, lightened of a part of its burden, rose rapidly\r\nwith M. Charles to a height of two miles in the air. Most of the\r\nfittings of the modern hydrogen balloon, the hoop and netting, for\r\ninstance, from which the car is suspended, and the valve at the top of\r\nthe balloon for the release of the gas, were devised by Charles. The\r\nunfortunate Pilatre de Rozier met his death on the 15th of June 1785, in\r\nan attempt to cross from Boulogne to England. In order to avoid a\r\nconstant wastage of hydrogen in controlling the height of the balloon,\r\nhe devised a double balloon; the larger one, above, was filled with\r\nhydrogen, the smaller one, below, was worked with hot air from a\r\nbrazier, on the Montgolfier principle. At a height of some three\r\nthousand feet, while it was still over French territory, the double\r\nballoon caught fire and fell flaming to the earth.\r\n\r\nThe earliest balloon ascents in England followed close upon the French\r\nexperiments. On the 25th of November 1783 Count Francesco Zambeccari\r\nsent up an oil-silk hydrogen balloon, ten feet in diameter, from the\r\nArtillery Ground in Moorfields; it travelled forty-eight miles, and fell\r\nat Petworth in Sussex. On the 22nd of February 1784 a balloon of five\r\nfeet in diameter, liberated at Sandwich in Kent, travelled seventy-five\r\nmiles, and after crossing the Channel, fell at Warneton in Flanders. To\r\ninflate a bag with gas and let it take its chance in the air is no great\r\nachievement, but these were flights of good promise. The first person in\r\nGreat Britain to navigate the air was James Tytler, a Scot, who on the\r\n27th of August 1784 ascended in a fire-balloon, that is, a balloon\r\nfilled with hot air, from Comely Gardens, Edinburgh, and travelled about\r\nhalf a mile. Tytler had been employed by the booksellers to edit the\r\nsecond edition of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_, of which he wrote the\r\ngreater part, at a salary of seventeen shillings a week; he passed his\r\nlife in poverty, and his balloon adventure attracted little attention.\r\nThe public mania for ballooning as a spectacle began with the ascents of\r\nVincenzo Lunardi, secretary to the Neapolitan ambassador in England.\r\nLunardi's first ascent, which was well advertised, was made from the\r\nArtillery Ground in Moorfields on the 15th of September 1784, in the\r\npresence of nearly two hundred thousand spectators. His hydrogen\r\nballoon, of about thirty-two feet in diameter, sailed high over London,\r\nand descended near Ware in Hertfordshire. His record of his sensations,\r\nwritten in imperfect English, and published in 1784 under the title of\r\n_An Account of the First Aerial Voyage in England_, deserves quotation:\r\n\r\n'At five minutes after two, the last gun was fired, the cords divided,\r\nand the Balloon rose, the company returning my signals of adieu with the\r\nmost unfeigned acclamations and applauses. The effect was that of a\r\nmiracle on the multitudes which surrounded the place; and they passed\r\nfrom incredulity and menace into the most extravagant expressions of\r\napprobation and joy.\r\n\r\n'At the height of twenty yards, the Balloon was a little depressed by\r\nthe wind, which had a fine effect; it held me over the ground for a few\r\nseconds, and seemed to pause majestically before its departure.\r\n\r\n'On discharging a part of the ballast, it ascended to the height of two\r\nhundred yards. As a multitude lay before me of a hundred and fifty\r\nthousand people, who had not seen my ascent from the ground, I had\r\nrecourse to every stratagem to let them know I was in the gallery, and\r\nthey literally rent the air with their acclamations and applause. In\r\nthese stratagems I devoted my flag, and worked with my oars, one of\r\nwhich was immediately broken and fell from me. A pigeon too escaped,\r\nwhich, with a dog, and cat, were the only companions of my excursion.\r\n\r\n'When the thermometer had fallen from 68 deg. to 61 deg. I perceived a great\r\ndifference in the temperature of the air. I became very cold, and found\r\nit necessary to take a few glasses of wine. I likewise eat the leg of a\r\nchicken, but my bread and other provisions had been rendered useless by\r\nbeing mixed with the sand which I carried as ballast.\r\n\r\n'When the thermometer was at fifty, the effect of the atmosphere, and\r\nthe combination of circumstances around, produced a calm delight, which\r\nis inexpressible, and which no situation on earth could give. The\r\nstillness, extent, and magnificence of the scene rendered it highly\r\nawful. My horizon seemed a perfect circle; the terminating line several\r\nhundred miles in circumference. This I conjectured from the view of\r\nLondon; the extreme points of which, formed an angle of only a few\r\ndegrees. It was so reduced on the great scale before me, that I can find\r\nno simile to convey an idea of it. I could distinguish Saint Paul's and\r\nother churches, from the houses. I saw the streets as lines, all\r\nanimated with beings, whom I knew to be men and women, but which I\r\nshould otherwise have had a difficulty in describing. It was an enormous\r\nbeehive, but the industry of it was suspended. All the moving mass\r\nseemed to have no object but myself, and the transition from the\r\nsuspicion, and perhaps contempt, of the preceding hour, to the\r\naffectionate transport, admiration and glory of the present moment, was\r\nnot without its effect on my mind. I recollected the puns[3] on my name,\r\nand was glad to find myself calm. I had soared from the apprehensions\r\nand anxieties of the Artillery Ground, and felt as if I had left behind\r\nme all the cares and passions that molest mankind.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: In some of the papers, witticisms appeared on the\r\n    affinity of Lunatic and Lunardi.]\r\n\r\n'Indeed, the whole scene before me filled the mind with a sublime\r\npleasure, of which I never had a conception. The critics imagine, for\r\nthey seldom speak from experience, that terror is an ingredient in every\r\nsublime sensation. It was not possible for me to be on earth in a\r\nsituation so free from apprehension. I had not the slightest sense of\r\nmotion from the Machine, I knew not whether it went swiftly or slowly,\r\nwhether it ascended or descended, whether it was agitated or tranquil,\r\nbut by the appearance or disappearance of objects on the earth. I moved\r\nto different parts of the gallery, I adjusted the furniture, and\r\napparatus, I uncorked my bottle, eat, drank, and wrote, just as in my\r\nstudy. The height had not the effect, which a much lesser degree of it\r\nhas near the earth, that of producing giddiness. The broomsticks of the\r\nwitches, Ariosto's flying-horse, and even Milton's sunbeam, conveying\r\nthe angel to the earth, have all an idea of effort, difficulty, and\r\nrestraint, which do not affect a voyage in the Balloon.\r\n\r\n'Thus tranquil, and thus situated, how shall I describe to you a view,\r\nsuch as the ancients supposed Jupiter to have of the earth, and to copy\r\nwhich there are no terms in any language. The gradual diminution of\r\nobjects, and the masses of light and shade are intelligible in oblique\r\nand common prospects. But here every thing wore a new appearance, and\r\nhad a new effect. The face of the country had a mild and permanent\r\nverdure, to which Italy is a stranger. The variety of cultivation, and\r\nthe accuracy with which property is divided, give the idea ever present\r\nto a stranger in England, of good civil laws and an equitable\r\nadministration; the rivers meandering; the sea glist'ning with the rays\r\nof the sun; the immense district beneath me spotted with cities, towns,\r\nvillages, houses, pouring out their inhabitants to hail my appearance:\r\nyou will allow me some merit at not having been exceedingly intoxicated\r\nwith my situation.\r\n\r\n'The interest which the spectators took in my voyage was so great, that\r\nthe things I threw down were divided and preserved as our people would\r\nrelicks of the most celebrated saints. And a gentlewoman, mistaking the\r\noar for my person, was so affected with my supposed destruction, that\r\nshe died in a few days.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor many months after this the Flying Man was the chief topic of\r\nconversation in the town. Even in the previous year reports of the\r\nFrench ascents had produced a fever of excitement in London. 'Balloons',\r\nsaid Horace Walpole, writing in December 1783, 'occupy senators,\r\nphilosophers, ladies, everybody.' All other interests yielded\r\nprecedence. Miss Burney's _Cecilia_ was the novel of the season, but it\r\nhad to give way. 'Next to the balloon,' said Mrs. Barbauld, in a letter\r\nwritten in January 1784, 'Miss Burney is the object of public\r\ncuriosity.' A few weeks earlier, Dr. Johnson passed the day with three\r\nfriends, and boasted to Mrs. Thrale that no mention had been made by any\r\nof them of the air balloon, 'which has taken full possession, with a\r\nvery good claim, of every philosophical mind and mouth'. Some days after\r\nLunardi's first ascent Johnson wrote to a friend, 'I had this day in\r\nthree letters three histories of the flying man in the great Ballon. I\r\nam glad that we do as well as our neighbours.' Three letters were\r\nenough, and on the same day Johnson wrote to Sir Joshua Reynolds, 'Do\r\nnot write about the balloon, whatever else you may think proper to say'.\r\nOn the 29th of September 1784 Lunardi's balloon caught fire by accident,\r\nand was burnt on the ground. Johnson's quiet and sensible comment is\r\nconveyed in a letter to his friend Dr. Brocklesby, on the 6th of\r\nOctober: 'The fate of the balloon I do not much lament: to make new\r\nballoons is to repeat the jest again. We now know a method of mounting\r\ninto the air, and, I think, are not likely to know more. The vehicles\r\ncan serve no use till we can guide them; and they can gratify no\r\ncuriosity till we mount with them to greater heights than we can reach\r\nwithout; till we rise above the tops of the highest mountains, which we\r\nhave yet not done. We know the state of the air in all its regions, to\r\nthe top of Teneriffe, and therefore, learn nothing from those who\r\nnavigate a balloon below the clouds. The first experiment, however, was\r\nbold, and deserved applause and reward.'\r\n\r\nJohnson died in December of that same year; the balloon had made its\r\nappearance just in time for his comments. Another critic, Horace\r\nWalpole, was in two minds about balloons. Sometimes they seemed to him\r\n'philosophic playthings'. He was growing old, and did not care to spend\r\nhis time in 'divining with what airy vehicles the atmosphere will be\r\npeopled hereafter, or how much more expeditiously the east, west, or\r\nsouth will be ravaged and butchered, than they have been by the old\r\nclumsy method of navigation'. Yet in spite of his elegant indifference,\r\nhe could not help being interested; and some of his divinations come\r\nvery near to the truth. He pictures Salisbury Plain, Newmarket Heath,\r\nand all downs, arising into dockyards for aerial vessels; and he\r\nprofesses himself willing to go to Paris by air, 'if there is no air\r\nsickness'. The best defence of the new invention was spoken by Benjamin\r\nFranklin, who when he was asked in Paris, 'What is the use of balloons?'\r\nreplied by another question--'What is the use of a newborn infant?'\r\n\r\nThe infancy of the balloon lasted long; indeed, if lack of self-control\r\nbe the mark of infancy, the balloon was an infant during the whole of\r\nthe nineteenth century. In the early days, new achievements, in distance\r\nor height, kept public expectation alive. Jean Pierre Blanchard, a\r\nFrench aeronaut, and rival of Lunardi, succeeded, on the 7th of January\r\n1785, in crossing the English Channel from Dover. Thereafter ascents\r\nbecame so numerous that it is impossible to keep count of them.\r\nGlaisher, writing about 1870, says that the most remarkable ascent of\r\nthe century was that fitted out by Robert Hollond, Esq., M.P. The\r\nballoonist was Charles Green, and they were accompanied by Mr. Monck\r\nMason, who published an account of the voyage. In Mr. Green's balloon,\r\nafterwards called the _Great Nassau_, they left Vauxhall Gardens on the\r\nafternoon of Monday, the 7th of November 1836, with provisions to last a\r\nfortnight. They were soon lost in the clouds, and after crossing the\r\nsea, had no very clear idea of what country they were over. After\r\neighteen hours' journey, fearing that they had reached Poland or Russia,\r\nthey came to earth, and found that they had travelled five hundred\r\nmiles, to the neighbourhood of the town of Weilburg, in the duchy of\r\nNassau. Charles Green was the most experienced aeronaut of his time; he\r\nwas the first to use coal-gas in place of hydrogen, and he was the\r\ninventor of the guide-rope, which is dropped from a balloon to allow her\r\nto be secured by a landing party, or is trailed on the ground to reduce\r\nher speed and to assist in maintaining a steady height.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of the balloon were diminished by the labours of scientific\r\nmen, but its disabilities remained. No one who travelled in a balloon\r\ncould choose his destination. The view of the earth, and of the clouds,\r\nobtainable from a height, was beautiful and unfamiliar, but in the\r\nabsence of any specific utility the thing became a popular toy. In\r\npublic gardens a balloon could be counted on to attract a crowd, and the\r\nshowman soon gave it its place, as a miracle of nature, by the side of\r\nthe giant and the dwarf, the living skeleton, and the fat woman. A horse\r\nis not seen to advantage in the car of a balloon, but it is a marvel\r\nthat a horse should be seen there at all, and equestrian ascents became\r\none of the attractions of the Cremorne Gardens in 1821.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1859 that an organized attempt was made to reclaim the\r\nballoon for the purposes of science. In that year a committee, appointed\r\nby the British Association to make observations on the higher strata of\r\nthe atmosphere, met at Wolverhampton. Volunteers were lacking until, in\r\n1862, James Glaisher, one of the members of the committee, declared his\r\nwillingness to prepare the apparatus and to make the observations from a\r\nballoon. Glaisher had spent many years on meteorological observation, in\r\nIreland, at Cambridge University, and at the Royal Observatory,\r\nGreenwich. He proposed to investigate the effect of different elevations\r\non the temperature of the dew-point; on the composition and electrical\r\ncondition of the atmosphere, and on the rate and direction of the wind\r\ncurrents in it; on the earth's magnetism, and the solar spectrum; on\r\nsound, and on solar radiation. From 1862 to 1866 he made twenty-eight\r\nascents, with Henry Coxwell as his balloonist. The most famous of these\r\nwas from Wolverhampton on the 5th of September 1862, when Glaisher\r\nclaimed to have reached a height of fully seven miles. After recording a\r\nheight of 29,000 feet Glaisher swooned; Coxwell lost the use of his\r\nlimbs, but succeeded in pulling the cord of the valve with his teeth.\r\nWhen Glaisher swooned the balloon was ascending rapidly; when he came\r\nto, thirteen minutes later, it was descending rapidly, and the height\r\nthat he claimed was an inference, supported by the reading of a minimum\r\nthermometer. Critics have pointed out that his calculations made no\r\nallowance for the slackening of the upward pace of the balloon as it\r\nneared its limit, nor for the time it would take, with the valve feebly\r\npulled, to change its direction and acquire speed in its descent. They\r\nare inclined to allow him a height of about six miles, which is a\r\nsufficiently remarkable achievement.\r\n\r\nAll these ascents, though they proved that the balloon had a certain\r\nutility for the exploration of the upper reaches of the atmosphere, did\r\nlittle or nothing for aerial navigation. The great vogue of the balloon\r\ndistracted attention from the real problem of flight. That problem was\r\nnot abandoned; a number of men, working independently, without any sort\r\nof public recognition, made steady advance during the whole course of\r\nthe nineteenth century. By the end of the century, three years before\r\nflight was achieved, those who were most deeply concerned in the attempt\r\nknew that success was near. The great difficulty of scientific research\r\nlies in choosing the right questions to ask of nature. Every lawyer\r\nknows that it is easy to put a question so full of false assumptions\r\nthat no true answer to it is possible; and many a laborious man of\r\nscience has spent his life in framing such questions, and in looking for\r\nan answer to them. The contribution of the nineteenth century to the\r\nscience of flight was that it got hold of the right questions, and\r\nformulated them more or less exactly, so that the answers, when once\r\nthey were supplied by continued observation and experiment, were things\r\nof value.\r\n\r\nThe earliest of these pioneers was Sir George Cayley, a country\r\ngentleman with estates in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, who devoted his\r\nlife to scientific pursuits. He was born in 1773, and the balloons which\r\nexcited the world during his boyhood directed his mind to the subject of\r\naerial navigation. He invented many mechanical contrivances, and he laid\r\ngreat and just stress on the importance of motive power for successful\r\nflight. In 1809 he published, in _Nicholson's Journal_, a paper on\r\nAerial Navigation, which has since become a classic, for although it\r\nstops short of a complete exposition, it is true so far as it goes, and\r\ncontains no nonsense and no fantasy. He endeavoured, in the first year\r\nof Queen Victoria's reign, to establish an aeronautical society, but the\r\nill repute of the balloon and the bad company it kept deprived him of\r\ninfluential support. He did his duty by his county, as a Whig magnate,\r\nand amused his leisure with science, till his death in 1857.\r\n\r\nCayley's work is difficult to assess. He had all the right ideas, though\r\nthe means of putting them into practice did not lie ready to his hand.\r\nIf he had been a poor man, he might have gone farther. He designed, so\r\nto say, both an airship and an aeroplane; there was no one to execute\r\nhis designs, and the scheme fell through. He more than once anticipated\r\nlater inventions, but he put nothing on the market. His mind was fertile\r\nin mechanical devices, so that if one proved troublesome, he could\r\nalways turn his attention to another. He is content to enunciate a\r\ntruth, and to call it probable. 'Probably', he says, in discussing\r\nengines of small weight and high power, 'a much cheaper engine of this\r\nsort might be produced by a gas-light apparatus and by firing the\r\ninflammable air generated with a due portion of common air under a\r\npiston.' This is an exact forecast of the engine used to-day in all\r\nflying machines. He has some good remarks on the shape that offers least\r\nresistance to the air in passing through it, that is, on the doctrine of\r\nthe streamline. He knew that the shape of the hinder part of a solid\r\nbody which travels through the air is of as much importance as the shape\r\nof the fore-part in diminishing resistance. He does not seem to have\r\nknown that it is of more importance. He knew that the resistance of the\r\nair acting on concave wings, or planes, at a small angle of incidence\r\nwas resolved chiefly into lift, and he suspected that the amount of the\r\nlift was greater than the mathematical theory of his day allowed. Above\r\nall, his treatise is stimulating, and suggests further inquiry and\r\nexperiment along lines which have since proved to be the right lines.\r\n\r\nCayley's ideas were developed in practice by John Stringfellow, a\r\nmanufacturer of lace machinery at Chard, in Somersetshire, and by his\r\nfriend W. S. Henson, a young engineer. They constructed a light\r\nsteam-engine, and designed an aeroplane, of which they entertained such\r\nhigh hopes that they took out a patent, and applied to Parliament for an\r\nAct to incorporate an Aerial Steam Transit Company. The reaction of\r\npublic opinion on their proposals took the form of drag rather than\r\nlift, and they were thrown back on their own resources. In 1847 they\r\nmade a model aeroplane, twenty feet in span, driven by two four-bladed\r\nairscrews, three feet in diameter, and they experimented with it on Bala\r\nDown, near Chard. It did not fly. Henson, completely discouraged,\r\nmarried and went to America; Stringfellow persisted, and in 1848 made a\r\nsmaller model, ten feet in span, with airscrews sixteen inches in\r\ndiameter. This machine, which had wings slightly cambered, with a rigid\r\nleading edge and a flexible trailing edge, made several successful\r\nflights, first in a long covered room at Chard, and later, before a\r\nnumber of witnesses, at Cremorne Gardens. After this success\r\nStringfellow did no more for many years, until the foundation of the\r\nAeronautical Society of Great Britain in 1866 roused him again to\r\nactivity. At the society's exhibition of 1868, held in the Crystal\r\nPalace, he produced a model triplane, which ran along suspended from a\r\nwire, and, when its engine was in action, lifted itself as it ran.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the Aeronautical Society, with the Duke of Argyll as\r\npresident and with a council of men of science, attracted fresh minds to\r\nthe study of flight, and gave the subject a respectable standing. Mr.\r\nWenham's paper, read to the society on the 27th of June 1866, proved\r\nthat the effective sustaining area of a wing is limited to a narrow\r\nportion behind the leading edge; that, in order to increase this area,\r\nthe planes of a flying machine might advantageously be placed one above\r\nanother--an idea which was borrowed and put into practice by Mr.\r\nStringfellow in his triplane--and that a heavy body, supported on\r\nplanes, requires less power to drive it through the air at a high speed\r\nthan to maintain it in flight at a low speed. For some years the society\r\nflourished; then its energies declined, and it fell into a state of\r\nsuspended animation. At its second exhibition, in 1885, there were only\r\nsixteen exhibits as against seventy-eight at the exhibition of 1868. The\r\nprospects of practical success seemed remoter than ever. At last, thirty\r\nyears after its foundation, it sprang into renewed activity, and, with\r\nMajor B. F. S. Baden-Powell as secretary, did an immense work, from 1897\r\nonwards, in directing and furthering the study of aviation. The\r\n_Aeronautical Journal_, which was published quarterly by the revived\r\nsociety, is a record of the years of progress and triumph.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this sudden revival is to be sought in the extraordinary\r\nfermentation which had been going on under the surface, both in Europe\r\nand America. The public was careless and sceptical; inventors who were\r\nseeking practical success were shy of premature publicity; papers read\r\nto learned societies were more concerned with theory than with practice;\r\nbut there was hope in the air, and hundreds of minds were independently\r\nat work on the problem of flight. Some idea of the variety of\r\nsuggestions and devices may be gathered from Mr. Octave Chanute's\r\n_Progress in Flying Machines_, a reprint of a series of articles by him,\r\nwhich appeared, from 1891 onwards, in _The Railroad and Engineering\r\nJournal_ of New York City. It was said in the ancient world that there\r\nis nothing so absurd but some philosopher has believed it; there is no\r\nimaginable way of flight that has not engaged the time and effort of\r\nsome inventor. Yet among the multitude of attempts it is not difficult\r\nto trace the ancestry of the modern flying machine. Wing-flapping\r\nmachines left no issue. Machines supported in the air by helicopters,\r\nthat is, by horizontal revolving blades, can be made to rise from the\r\nground, but cannot easily be made to travel. The way to success was by\r\nimitation of soaring birds; and it is worthy of note that some of the\r\nbest minds were, from the first, fascinated by this method of flight,\r\nand were never tired of observing it. Cayley remarks that the swift,\r\nthough it is a powerful flyer, is not able to elevate itself from level\r\nground. Wenham records how an eagle, sitting in solitary state in the\r\nmidst of the Egyptian plain, was fired at with a shotgun, and had to run\r\nfull twenty yards, digging its talons into the soil, before it could\r\nraise itself into the air. M. Mouillard, of Cairo, spent more than\r\nthirty years in watching the flight of soaring birds, and devoted the\r\nwhole of his book, _L'Empire de l'Air_ (1881), to the investigation of\r\nsoaring flight. The pelican, the turkey-buzzard, the vulture, the\r\ncondor, have all had their students and disciples. M. Mouillard, indeed,\r\nmaintains that if there be a moderate wind, a bird can remain a whole\r\nday soaring in the air, with no expenditure of power whatever. To those\r\nwho have watched seagulls this may perhaps seem credible; but air is\r\ninvisible, and soaring birds are skilful to choose a place, in the wake\r\nof a ship or in the neighbourhood of a cliff, where there is an\r\nup-current of air, so that when they glide by their own weight, though\r\nthey are losing height in relation to the air, they are losing none in\r\nrelation to the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe parents of the modern flying machine were the gliders, that is, the\r\nmen who launched themselves into the air on wings or planes of their own\r\ndevising. The scientific investigators, who experimented with machines\r\nembodying the same principle, did much to assist the gliders, but in\r\njustice they must take a second place. The men who staked their lives\r\nwere the men who, after many losses, were rewarded with the conquest of\r\nthe air. There are stories of a certain Captain Lebris, how in 1854,\r\nnear Douarnenez in Brittany, he constructed an artificial albatross, and\r\ntying it by a slip rope to a cart which was driven against the wind,\r\nmounted in it to a height of three hundred feet. But the first glider of\r\nwhom we have any full knowledge is Otto Lilienthal of Berlin. He devoted\r\nhis whole life to the study of aviation at a time when in Germany people\r\nlooked upon such a pursuit as little better than lunacy. The principal\r\nprofessor of mathematics at the Berlin Gewerbe Academie, on hearing that\r\nLilienthal was experimenting with aeronautics, advised him to spend no\r\nmoney on such things--a piece of advice which, Lilienthal remarks, was\r\nunhappily quite superfluous. In 1889 he completed, with the help of his\r\nbrother, a series of experiments on the carrying capacity of arched, or\r\ncambered, wings, and published the results in a book entitled _Bird\r\nFlight as the Basis of Aviation_. In his youth every crow that flew by\r\npresented him with a problem to solve in its slowly moving wings.\r\nProlonged study led him to the conclusion that the slight fore-and-aft\r\ncurvature of the wing was the secret of flying. But he knew too much to\r\nsuppose that this conclusion solved the problem. A dozen other\r\ndifficulties, including the difficulty of balance, remained to be\r\nmastered. When German societies for the advancement of aerial navigation\r\nbegan to be formed, he at first held aloof from them, for the balloon,\r\nwhich he regarded as the chief obstacle to the development of flight,\r\nmonopolized their entire attention. His insistence on the cambered wing\r\ndid not convince others, who went on experimenting with flat planes.\r\nGerman and Austrian aviators, it is true, were induced by his book to\r\nput aside flat surfaces and introduce arched wings. 'However,' he\r\nremarks, 'as this was done mainly on paper, in projects, and in\r\naeronautical papers and discussions, I felt impelled myself to carry out\r\nmy theory in practice.' So, in the summer of 1891, on a pair of\r\nbird-like wings, with eighty-six square feet of supporting surface,\r\nstabilized by a horizontal tail and a vertical fin aft, he began his\r\ngliding experiments. His whole apparatus, made of peeled willow sticks,\r\ncovered with cotton shirting, weighed less than forty pounds. He was\r\nsupported in it wholly on his forearms, which passed through padded\r\ntubes, while his hands grasped a cross-bar. He guided the machine and\r\npreserved its balance by shifting his weight, backwards or forwards or\r\nsideways. In this apparatus, altered and improved from time to time,\r\nLilienthal, during the next five years, made more than two thousand\r\nsuccessful glides. At first he used to jump off a spring-board; then he\r\npractised on some hills in the suburbs of Berlin; then, in the spring of\r\n1894, he built a conical hill at Gross-Lichterfelde to serve him as a\r\nstarting-ground. Later on, he moved to the Rhinow hills. His best glides\r\nwere made against a light breeze at a gradient of about 1 in 10; and he\r\ncould easily travel a hundred yards through the air. 'Regulating the\r\ncentre of gravity', he says, 'becomes a second nature, like balancing on\r\na bicycle; it is entirely a matter of practice and experience.' His most\r\nalarming experiences were from gusts of wind which would suddenly raise\r\nhim many metres in the air and suspend him in a stationary position. But\r\nhis skill was so great that he always succeeded in resuming his flight\r\nand alighting safely. He continued to improve and develop his machine.\r\nHe made a double-surface glider, on the biplane principle, and flew on\r\nit. He experimented with engines, intended to flap the extremities of\r\nthe wings--first a steam-engine of two horse-power, weighing forty-four\r\npounds, then a simpler and lighter type, worked by compressed carbonic\r\nacid gas. But he explains that these can be safely introduced only if\r\nthey do not impair the gliding efficiency of the machine, and he does\r\nnot seem to have made much progress with them. His last improvement was\r\na movable horizontal tail, or elevator, worked by a line attached to his\r\nhead, to control the fore-and-aft balance of the machine. This fresh\r\ncomplexity was perhaps the cause of his death. On the 9th of August 1896\r\nhe started on a long glide from a hill about a hundred feet high; a\r\nsudden gust of wind caught him, and it is supposed that the involuntary\r\nmovements of his head in the effort to regain his balance made matters\r\nworse; the machine plunged to the ground, and he was fatally injured.\r\n\r\nLilienthal was a good mathematician, a careful recorder of the results\r\nof his experiments, and a disinterested student of nature. Complete\r\nsuccess was denied to him, but his work informed and stimulated others.\r\nThe Wright brothers, when they first took up the problem of flight, had\r\nthe advantage of acquaintance with Professor S. P. Langley's\r\naeronautical researches, but their gliding experiments were shaped and\r\ninspired by what they had read of Lilienthal's achievements.\r\n\r\nThe other pioneer, who has earned a place beside Lilienthal, is Percy\r\nPilcher. In 1893, at the age of twenty-seven, he became assistant\r\nlecturer in naval architecture and marine engineering at Glasgow\r\nUniversity. He devoted all his spare time to aeronautics, and in 1895\r\nbuilt his first glider, which he named 'The Bat'. The machine was built,\r\nwith the help of his sister, in the sitting-room of their lodging in\r\nKersland street, Glasgow, and was tested on the banks of the Clyde, near\r\nCardross. Some defects were revealed by the tests; when these were\r\nremedied, and the glider was towed by a rope, Pilcher rose to a height\r\nof twenty feet, and remained in the air for nearly one minute.\r\nThereafter he built, in rapid succession, three new gliders, all of\r\ndifferent design, which he called 'The Beetle', 'The Gull', and 'The\r\nHawk'. The professor of naval architecture at Glasgow, Sir John Biles,\r\nsays of him, 'He was one of the few men I have met who had no sense of\r\nfear.... I was deterred from helping him as much as I ought to have done\r\nby a fear of the risks that he ran. He at one time talked to Lord Kelvin\r\nabout helping him: Lord Kelvin spoke to me about it, and said that on no\r\naccount would he help him, nor should I, as he would certainly break his\r\nneck. This was unfortunately too true a prophecy.' The Hawk was the best\r\nof his gliders; at Eynsford in Kent, on the 19th of June 1897, he made a\r\nperfectly balanced glide of 250 yards across a deep valley, towed only\r\nby a thin fishing line, 'which one could break with one's hands'. After\r\nthis, Pilcher began to make plans for fitting an engine to his glider.\r\nSince the first appearance of the Otto engine in 1876, and of the\r\nDaimler engine eight years later, the oil-engine had steadily developed\r\nin lightness and power, but no engine exactly suitable for his purpose\r\nwas on the market, so he resolved to build one. An engine of four\r\nhorse-power, weighing forty pounds, with a wooden airscrew five feet in\r\ndiameter, was, by his calculations, amply sufficient to maintain his\r\nglider in horizontal flight. The light engine has now been so enormously\r\nimproved, that it comes near to developing one horse-power for every\r\npound of weight. The violent have taken the kingdom of the air by force:\r\nin Pilcher's day the problem was more delicate. He worked at his engine\r\nin his leisure time, and, leaving the firm of Maxim & Nordenfeldt, by\r\nwhom he had been employed from 1896 onwards, made, in 1898, his own\r\nfirm of Wilson & Pilcher. In the spring of 1899 he was much impressed\r\nby Mr. Laurence Hargrave's soaring kites, exhibited by the inventor at a\r\nmeeting of the Aeronautical Society, and it seems that he embodied some\r\nof Mr. Hargrave's ideas in his latest built machine, a triplane. He\r\nintended to fly this machine at Stanford Hall, Market Harborough, where\r\nhe was staying with Lord Braye, but on the day appointed, the 30th of\r\nSeptember 1899, the weather proved too wet. Nevertheless Pilcher\r\nconsented to give some demonstrations on The Hawk, towed by a light\r\nline; during the second of these, while he was soaring at a height of\r\nthirty feet, one of the guy-wires of the tail broke, and the machine\r\nturned over and crashed. Pilcher never recovered consciousness, and died\r\ntwo days later. His name will always be remembered in the history of\r\nflight. If he had survived his risks for a year or two more, it seems\r\nnot unlikely that he would have been the first man to navigate the air\r\non a power-driven machine. He left behind him his gallant example, and\r\nsome advances in design, for he improved the balance of the machine by\r\nraising its centre of gravity, and he provided it with wheels, fitted on\r\nshock-absorbers, for taking off and alighting.\r\n\r\nLilienthal and Pilcher are pre-eminent among the early gliders, for\r\ntheir efforts were scientific, continuous, and progressive. But there\r\nwere others; and it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine the\r\ncomparative value of experiments carried on, many of them in private, by\r\ninventors of all countries. Professor J. J. Montgomery, of California,\r\ncarried out some successful glides, on machines of his own devising, as\r\nearly as 1884; and Mr. Octave Chanute, the best historian of all these\r\nearly efforts, having secured the services of Mr. A. M. Herring, a much\r\nyounger man who had already learned to use a Lilienthal machine, made a\r\nseries of experiments, with gliders of old and new types, on the shores\r\nof Lake Michigan, during the summer of 1896. About the same time some\r\npower-driven machines, attached to prepared tracks, were successfully\r\nflown. In 1893 Horatio Phillips flew a model, with many planes arranged\r\none above another like a Venetian blind, on a circular track at Harrow;\r\nand in the same year Sir Hiram Maxim's large machine, with four thousand\r\nfeet of supporting surface, was built at Baldwin's Park in Kent, and,\r\nwhen it was tested, developed so great a lift that it broke the guide\r\nrails placed to restrain it. Clement Ader, a French electrical engineer,\r\nworked at the problem of flight for many years, and, having obtained the\r\nsupport of the French Government, constructed a large bat-like machine,\r\ndriven by a steam-engine of forty horse-power. In 1897 this machine was\r\nsecretly tried, at the military camp of Satory, near Paris, and was\r\nreported on by a Government commission; all that was known thereafter\r\nwas that the Government had refused to advance further funds, and that\r\nAder had abandoned his attempts. When the Wrights had made their\r\nsuccessful flights, a legend of earlier flights by Ader grew up in\r\nFrance; a heated controversy ensued, and the friends of M. Santos\r\nDumont, who claimed that he was the first to fly over French soil, at\r\nlength induced the French Government to publish the report on the trial\r\nof Ader's machine. The report proved that the machine had not left the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIt is not in mortals to command success; but those who study the record\r\nof the ingenious, persevering, and helpful work done for a quarter of a\r\ncentury by Mr. Laurence Hargrave, of Sydney, New South Wales, will agree\r\nwith Mr. Chanute that this man deserved success. His earliest important\r\npaper was read to the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1884. In the\r\ncourse of the next ten years he made with his own hands eighteen\r\ndifferent flying machines, of increasing size, all of which flew. His\r\nearlier machines were not much larger than toys, and were supplied with\r\npower by the pull of stretched india-rubber. On this scale he was\r\nsuccessful with a machine driven by an airscrew and with a machine\r\ndriven by the flapping of wings. As his machines grew in size he turned\r\nhis attention to engines. He was successful with compressed air; he made\r\nmany experiments with explosion motors; and he succeeded in producing a\r\nsteam-engine which weighed seven pounds and developed almost two-thirds\r\nof one horse-power. In 1893 he invented the box-kite, which is a true\r\nbiplane, with the vertical sides of the kite doing the work of a\r\nstabilizing fin. This kite had a marked influence on the design of some\r\nearly flying machines. He also invented the soaring kite. His hope that\r\nman would fly was more than hope; he refused to argue the question with\r\nobjectors, for 'I know', he said, 'that success is dead sure to come'.\r\nMoreover he put all his researches at the disposal of others. He refused\r\nto take out any patents. He did all he could to induce workers to follow\r\nhis example and communicate their ideas freely, so that progress might\r\nbe quickened. His own ideas, his own inventions, and his own carefully\r\nrecorded experiments were a solid step in that staircase of knowledge\r\nfrom which at last man launched himself into the air, and flew.\r\n\r\nIn America the pioneer who did most to further the science of human\r\nflight was Professor Samuel Pierpont Langley, of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitute, in Washington. He was well known as an astronomer before ever\r\nhe took up with aeronautics. From 1866 to 1887 he was professor of\r\nastronomy at the Western University of Pennsylvania, at Pittsburg.\r\nDuring his later years there he built a laboratory for aerial\r\ninvestigations, and carried out his famous experiments. His whirling\r\ntable, with an arm about thirty feet long, which could be moved at all\r\nspeeds up to seventy miles an hour, was devised to measure the lifting\r\npower of air resistance on brass plates suspended to the arm. In 1891 he\r\npublished his _Experiments in Aerodynamics_, which embodied the definite\r\nmathematical results obtained by years of careful research. It would be\r\ndifficult to exaggerate the importance of this work. The law which\r\ngoverns the reaction of the air on planes travelling at various speeds\r\nand various angles of incidence had been guessed at, or seen in\r\nglimpses, by earlier investigators; but here were ascertained numerical\r\nvalues offered to students and inventors. The main result is best stated\r\nin Professor Langley's own words: 'When the arm was put in motion I\r\nfound that the faster it went the less weight the plates registered on\r\nthe scales, until at great speed they almost floated in the air.... I\r\nfound that only one-twentieth of the force before supposed to be\r\nrequired to support bodies under such conditions was needed, and what\r\nbefore had seemed impossible began to look possible.... Some\r\nmathematicians, reasoning from false data, had concluded that if it took\r\na certain amount of power to keep a thing from falling, it would take\r\nmuch additional power to make it advance. My experiment showed just the\r\nreverse ... that the faster the speed the less the force required to\r\nsustain the planes, and that it would cost less to transport such planes\r\nthrough the air at a high rate of speed than at a low one. I found\r\nfurther that one horse-power could carry brass plates weighing two\r\nhundred pounds at the rate of more than forty miles an hour in\r\nhorizontal flight.'\r\n\r\nWhen these researches were known and understood, their effect upon the\r\npractical handling of the problem of flight was immediate and decisive.\r\nThe aeroplane, or gliding machine, had many rivals; they were all killed\r\nby Professor Langley's researches, which showed that the cheapest and\r\nbest way to raise a plane in the air is to drive it forward at a small\r\nupward inclination; and that its weight can be best countered not by\r\napplying power to raise it vertically, but by driving it fast. In the\r\nstatistical tables that he prepared he called the upward pressure of the\r\nair _Lift_; the pressure which retards horizontal motion he called\r\n_Drift_. The words make a happy pair, but the word _Drift_ is badly\r\nneeded to describe the leeway of an aeroplane in a cross-wind, so that\r\nin England another pair of words, _Lift_ and _Drag_, has been\r\nauthoritatively substituted.\r\n\r\nFrom this time onward Langley devoted himself to those other problems,\r\nespecially the problems of balance, of mechanical power, and of safety\r\nin taking off and alighting, which had to be solved if he was to make a\r\nmachine that should fly. He was much influenced, he says, by a\r\nmechanical toy, produced as early as 1871 by an ingenious Frenchman\r\ncalled Penaud, and named by its inventor the 'planophore'. This toy,\r\nwhich weighed only a little over half an ounce, was supported on wings,\r\nand was driven forward by an airscrew made of two feathers. The motive\r\npower was supplied by twisted strands of rubber which, as they\r\nuntwisted, turned the airscrew. The wings were set at a dihedral angle,\r\nthat is, they were bent upwards at the tips; and fore-and-aft stability\r\nwas secured by a smaller pair of wings just in front of the airscrew.\r\n'Simple as this toy looked,' says Professor Langley, 'it was the father\r\nof a future flying machine, and France ought to have the credit of it.'\r\nHis own steam-driven flying machine was produced and successfully flown\r\nin 1896. It had two wings and a tail, with a supporting surface in all\r\nof seventy square feet; its total weight was seventy-two pounds; the\r\nengine, constructed by himself, weighed only seven pounds and developed\r\none horse-power, which served to drive two airscrews, revolving in\r\nopposite directions. The best flight of this machine was more than\r\nthree-quarters of a mile, and was made over the Potomac river. When, on\r\nits first flight, it had flown for a minute, 'I felt', says Professor\r\nLangley, 'that something had been accomplished at last, for never in any\r\npart of the world or in any period had any machine of man's construction\r\nsustained itself in the air before for even half of this brief time'.\r\nHis flying machines were called by Langley 'aerodromes', and the word\r\n'aeroplane' was used by him, as it is used in the _New English\r\nDictionary_ of 1888, only in the sense of a single plane surface used\r\nfor aerial experiments. But no usage, however authoritative, can\r\nwithstand the tide of popular fashion; the machine is now an aeroplane,\r\nwhile aerodrome is the name given to the flying-ground from which it\r\nstarts.\r\n\r\nThe success of his machine became widely known, and in 1898 the War\r\nDepartment of the United States, having ascertained that Langley was\r\nwilling to devote all his spare time to the work, allotted fifty\r\nthousand dollars for the development, construction, and test of a large\r\n'aerodrome', big enough to carry a man. The construction was long\r\ndelayed by the difficulty of finding a suitable engine. This difficulty\r\nhampered all early attempts at flight. The internal-combustion engine\r\nwas by this time pretty well understood, and, with the will to do it,\r\nmight have been made light enough for the purpose. But it was almost an\r\naxiom with engineering firms that a very light engine could not wear\r\nwell and was untrustworthy in other ways. One horse-power to the\r\nhundredweight was what they regarded as the standard of solid merit.\r\nFurther, they were prejudiced against that extremely rapid movement of\r\nthe parts which is necessary if the crank-shaft is to revolve more than\r\na thousand times a minute. They were asked to depart from all their\r\ncherished canons and to risk failure and break-down in order that man\r\nshould achieve what many of them regarded as an impossibility. It was\r\nwith Langley as it was with Pilcher and the Wrights; he had to make his\r\nown engine. By 1901 he had completed with the aid of his assistants an\r\nengine of fifty-two horse-power, weighing, with all its appurtenances,\r\nless than five pounds to the horse-power. A year and a half more was\r\nspent in adapting and co-ordinating the frame and appliances, and in\r\ncarrying out the shop tests. At last, on the 7th of October 1903, from a\r\nhouse-boat moored in the Potomac river, about forty miles below\r\nWashington, the first trial was made. The machine caught in the\r\nlaunching mechanism, and fell into the river, where it broke. It was\r\nrepaired, and a second trial was made on the 8th of December 1903. Again\r\nthe machine failed to clear the launching car, and plunged headlong into\r\nthe river, where the frame was broken by zealous efforts to salve it in\r\nthe dark. Nine days after this final failure the Wrights made their\r\nfirst successful power-driven flight, at Kitty Hawk, on the coast of\r\nNorth Carolina.\r\n\r\nLangley was almost seventy years old when his last and most ambitious\r\nmachine failed. He lived for two years more. If his contributions to the\r\nscience of flight, which are his chief title to fame, were ruled out of\r\nthe account, he would still be remembered as something more than a good\r\nastronomer--a man of many sciences, who cared little for his own\r\nadvancement, and much for the advancement of knowledge.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it is now possible to conceive how things stood\r\nwhen the brothers, Wilbur and Orville Wright, first attacked the problem\r\nof flying in the air. Men had flown, or rather had glided through the\r\nair, without engines to support and drive them. Machines had flown,\r\nwithout men to control and guide them. If the two achievements could be\r\ncombined in one, the problem was solved; but the combination, besides\r\nbringing together both sets of difficulties and dangers, added new\r\ndangers and difficulties, greater than either. Plainly, there were two\r\nways, and only two, of going about the business. Professor Langley held\r\nthat in order to learn to fly, you must have a flying machine to begin\r\nwith. Wilbur Wright, whose views on the point never varied from first to\r\nlast, held that you must have a man to begin with. The brothers were\r\nimpatient of 'the wasteful extravagance of mounting delicate and costly\r\nmachinery on wings which no one knew how to manage'. When they began\r\ntheir experiments they had already reached the conclusion that the\r\nproblem of constructing wings to carry the machine, and the problem of\r\nconstructing a motor to drive it, presented no serious difficulty; but\r\nthat the problem of equilibrium had been the real stumbling-block, and\r\nthat this problem of equilibrium was the problem of flight itself. 'It\r\nseemed to us', says Wilbur Wright, 'that the main reason why the problem\r\nhad remained so long unsolved was that no one had been able to obtain\r\nany adequate practice. We figured that Lilienthal in five years of time\r\nhad spent only about five hours in actual gliding through the air. The\r\nwonder was not that he had done so little, but that he had accomplished\r\nso much. It would not be considered at all safe for a bicycle rider to\r\nattempt to ride through a crowded city street after only five hours'\r\npractice, spread out in bits of ten seconds each over a period of five\r\nyears; yet Lilienthal with this brief practice was remarkably successful\r\nin meeting the fluctuations and eddies of wind gusts. We thought that if\r\nsome method could be found by which it would be possible to practise by\r\nthe hour instead of by the second there would be hope of advancing the\r\nsolution of a very difficult problem.'\r\n\r\nWhen this was written, in 1901, it was a forecast; it is now the history\r\nof a triumph. By prolonged scientific practice, undertaken with every\r\npossible regard to safety, on soaring and gliding machines, the Wrights\r\nbecame master pilots and conquerors of the air. Their success had in it\r\nno element of luck; it was earned, as an acrobat earns his skill. So\r\nconfident did they become that to the end their machines were all\r\nmachines of an unstable equilibrium, dependent for their safety on the\r\nskill and quickness of the pilot. Their triumph was a triumph of mind\r\nand character. Other men had more than their advantages, and failed,\r\nwhere these men succeeded. Great things have sometimes been done by a\r\nhappy chance; it was not so with the Wrights. They planned great things,\r\nand measured themselves against them, and were equal to them.\r\n\r\nWilbur and Orville Wright were the sons of Milton Wright, of Dayton,\r\nOhio. They came of New England stock. One of their ancestors emigrated\r\nfrom Essex in 1636, and settled at Springfield, Massachusetts; a later\r\nancestor moved west, to Dayton. Wilbur was born in 1867, and Orville in\r\n1871. They had two elder brothers and one younger sister; but Wilbur and\r\nOrville were so closely united in their lives and in their thoughts,\r\nthat it is not easy to speak of them apart. Mr. Griffith Brewer, who\r\nknew them both, was often asked which of the two was the originator, and\r\nwould reply, 'I think it was mostly Wilbur'; but would add, 'The thing\r\ncould not have been done without Orville'. Wilbur, being four years the\r\nelder, no doubt took the lead; but all their ideas and experiments were\r\nshared, so that their very thought became a duet. Wilbur, who died in\r\n1912, was a man of a steady mind and of a dominant character, hard-knit,\r\nquiet, intense. He has left some writings which reflect his nature; they\r\nhave a certain grim humour, and they mean business; they push aside all\r\nirrelevance, and go straight to the point. After adventures in printing\r\nand journalism the two brothers set up at Dayton as cycle manufacturers.\r\nThe death of Lilienthal, reported in the newspapers in 1896, first\r\ncalled their attention to flight, and they began to read all available\r\nbooks on the subject. They found that an immense amount of time and\r\nmoney had been spent on the problem of human flight--all to no effect.\r\nMakers of machines had abandoned their efforts. As for gliders, after\r\nthe death of Lilienthal, Mr. Chanute had discontinued his experiments,\r\nand, a little later, Mr. Pilcher fell and was killed. When knowledge of\r\nthese things came to the brothers, it appealed to them like a challenge.\r\nFrom 1899 onwards they turned all their thoughts to the problem. They\r\nwatched the flight of birds to see if they could surprise the secret of\r\nbalance. They studied gliding machines, and resolved to construct a\r\nmachine of their own, more or less on the model of Mr. Chanute's most\r\nsuccessful glider, which was a biplane, or 'double-decker'. When their\r\nmachine was partly built, they wrote to the weather bureau at\r\nWashington, and learned that the strongest and most constant winds were\r\nto be found on the coast of North Carolina. They then wrote to the\r\npostmaster of Kitty Hawk, who testified that the sand-hills of that\r\nplace were round and soft, well fitted for boys playing with flying\r\nmachines. They took the parts of their machine to Kitty Hawk, assembled\r\nand completed it in a tent, and forthwith began their long years of\r\ncontinuous and progressive experiment. Their chief helper was Mr.\r\nChanute. 'In the summer of 1901', they said, 'we became personally\r\nacquainted with Mr. Chanute. When he learned that we were interested in\r\nflying as a sport and not with any expectation of recovering the money\r\nwe were expending on it, he gave us much encouragement. At our\r\ninvitation he spent several weeks with us at our camp at Kill Devil\r\nHill, four miles south of Kitty Hawk, during our experiments of that and\r\nthe two succeeding years.'\r\n\r\nThe first two summers, 1900 and 1901, brought them some familiarity in\r\nthe handling of their first two gliders, which they navigated lying face\r\ndownward on the lower plane. In all their gliding experiments they\r\nstudied safety first. They knew that the business they had embarked on\r\nwas of necessity a long and dangerous one; that they were bound to\r\nencounter many dangers, and that each of them had only one life. They\r\ntook no avoidable risks. Gliding seemed to them, at first, to have been\r\ndiscredited by the deaths of Lilienthal and Pilcher, so they planned to\r\ntry their machine by tethering it with a rope and letting it float a few\r\nfeet from the ground, while they practised manipulation. The wind proved\r\nto be not strong enough to sustain the weighted machine, and they were\r\ncompelled to take to gliding. All their early glides were made as near\r\nthe ground as possible. The machine had no vertical rudder, but they\r\nfitted it, in front, with what they called a horizontal rudder, that is,\r\nan elevator. By the use of this they could bring it to the ground at\r\nonce when the wind was tricky and their balance was threatened. The\r\nlateral balance they attempted to control by warping the wings, but with\r\nno satisfactory results. They made glides longer than any on record, but\r\nwhile the problem of stability was still unsolved, there could be no\r\nreal progress. At the end of 1901, Wilbur Wright made the prediction\r\nthat men would some time fly, but that it would not be in their\r\nlifetime.\r\n\r\nThey returned to Dayton, and spent the winter in experiment and\r\nresearch. They had taken up aeronautics partly as a sport; they were now\r\ndrawn deeper and deeper into the scientific study of it. They made a\r\nwind-tunnel, sixteen inches square and about six feet long, and tested\r\nin it the lift and drag of model wings, made in various sizes and with\r\nvarious aspect ratios. The tables which they compiled from these\r\nexperiments were continually used by them thereafter, and superseded\r\nthe tables of Lilienthal and Langley, which took no account of the\r\naspect ratio. When they returned to Kitty Hawk, in the autumn of 1902,\r\nthey took with them a greatly improved glider. The aspect ratio of the\r\nplanes was six to one, instead of about three to one, as in their second\r\nglider. Further, while preserving the horizontal vane, or elevator, at\r\nthe front of the machine, they added a vertical vane, or rudder, at the\r\nrear. It was their failure to control the lateral balance in the\r\nexperiments of 1901 that suggested this device to them. From the first\r\nthey had discarded the method, practised by Lilienthal and Pilcher, of\r\nadjusting the lateral balance by shifting the weight of the operator's\r\nbody. This method seemed to them 'incapable of expansion to meet large\r\nconditions, because the weight to be moved and the distance of possible\r\nmotion were limited, while the disturbing forces steadily increased,\r\nboth with wing area and with wing velocity'. Accordingly they invented a\r\nmethod of warping the wings, to present them to the wind at different\r\nangles on the right and left sides. Thus the force of the wind was used\r\nto restore the balance which the wind itself had disturbed. But in their\r\nearly gliders this warping process acted in an unexpected way. The wing\r\nwhich, in order to raise that side of the machine, was presented to the\r\nwind at the greater angle of incidence often proved to be the wing which\r\nlagged and sank. The decrease in speed, due to the extra drag, more than\r\ncounterbalanced the effect of the larger angle. When they attempted to\r\nremedy this by introducing a fixed vertical vane in the rear, 'it\r\nincreased the trouble and made the machine 'absolutely dangerous'. Any\r\nside-slip became irrecoverable by causing the vertical fixed vane to\r\nstrike the wind on the side toward the low wing, instead of on the side\r\ntoward the high wing, as it should have done to correct the balance.\r\n'It was some time', the brothers remark, 'before a remedy was\r\ndiscovered. This consisted of movable rudders working in conjunction\r\nwith the twisting of the wings.' So that now three different parts of\r\nthe machine had to be controlled by wires, worked swiftly and correctly\r\nby the operator, to preserve the balance. There were the wing tips which\r\nhad to be warped. There was the horizontal vane in front which had to be\r\nadjusted, to keep the machine in level flight or to bring it to the\r\nground. There was the vertical vane behind which had to be moved this\r\nway and that to secure the desired effect from the warping of the wings.\r\n'For the sake of simplicity,' says Wilbur Wright, 'we decided to attach\r\nthe wires controlling the vertical tail to the wires warping the wings,\r\nso that the operator, instead of having to control three things at once,\r\nwould have to attend to only the forward horizontal rudder and the wing\r\nwarping mechanism; and only the latter would be needed for controlling\r\nlateral balance.'\r\n\r\nThe thing was done. They had built an aeroplane that could fly; and the\r\nlater introduction of an engine was as simple a matter as the harnessing\r\nof a horse to a carriage. 'With this apparatus', says Wilbur Wright,\r\nspeaking of the glider of 1902, 'we made nearly seven hundred glides in\r\nthe two or three weeks following. We flew it in calms and we flew it in\r\nwinds as high as thirty-five miles an hour. We steered it to right and\r\nleft, and performed all the evolutions necessary for flight. This was\r\nthe first time in the history of the world that a movable vertical tail\r\nhad been used in controlling the direction or the balance of a flying\r\nmachine. It was also the first time that a movable vertical tail had\r\nbeen used, in combination with wings adjustable to different angles of\r\nincidence, in controlling the balance and direction of an aeroplane. We\r\nwere the first to functionally employ a movable vertical tail in a\r\nflying aeroplane. We were the first to employ wings adjustable to\r\nrespectively different angles of incidence in a flying aeroplane. We\r\nwere the first to use the two in combination in a flying aeroplane.'\r\n\r\nIt is a large claim, and every word of it is true. New inventions are\r\ncommonly the work of many minds, and it would be easy to name at least\r\nhalf a dozen men to whose work the Wrights were indebted. But these were\r\ntributaries; the main achievement belongs wholly to the Wrights. Their\r\nquiet perseverance, through long years, in the face of every kind of\r\ndifficulty, is only a part of their distinction; the alertness and\r\nhumility of mind which refused all traffic with fixed ideas, and made\r\ndangers and disappointments the material of education, is what stamps\r\nthem with greatness. They put themselves to school to the winds. They\r\nknew that there is no cheap or easy way to master nature, and that only\r\nthe human spirit, at its best and highest, can win through in that long\r\nstruggle. Their patience never failed. 'Skill', says Wilbur Wright,\r\n'comes by the constant repetition of familiar feats rather than by a few\r\noverbold attempts at feats for which the performer is yet hardly\r\nprepared.' Man must learn to fly as he learns to walk. 'Before trying to\r\nrise to any dangerous height a man ought to know that in an emergency\r\nhis mind and muscles will work by instinct rather than by conscious\r\neffort. There is no time to think.'\r\n\r\nThe machine of 1902, which might be called the victory machine, deserves\r\na full description. It was a double-decked machine, with two planes\r\nfixed by struts one above the other about five feet apart. The planes\r\nwere thirty-two feet in span, and five feet in chord. The total area of\r\ntheir supporting surfaces was about three hundred and five square feet.\r\nThe operator lay on his face in the middle of the lower plane. The\r\nhorizontal rudder in front had a supporting surface of fifteen square\r\nfeet. The vertical tail, as they called it, which was the true rudder,\r\nwas reduced after trial to six square feet. The machine was supported on\r\nthe ground by skids, and was very strongly built. It weighed a hundred\r\nand sixteen and a half pounds, to which must be added about a hundred\r\nand forty pounds for the weight of the operator. It performed about a\r\nthousand glides, with only one injury, though it made many hard landings\r\nat full speed on uneven ground. The longest glide was 622-1/2 feet,\r\ntraversed in twenty-six seconds. The glides were made from the Kill\r\nDevil sand-hills, near Kitty Hawk--mounds of sand heaped up by the wind,\r\nthe biggest having a height of a hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe time had now come to invite an engine to bear a part in the\r\nproceedings. In the autumn of 1903 the brothers returned to Kitty Hawk\r\nfor their fourth season of experiment. They had built in the winter a\r\nmachine weighing six hundred pounds, including the operator and an eight\r\nhorse-power motor. Finding that the motor gave more power than had been\r\nestimated, they added a hundred and fifty pounds of weight in\r\nstrengthening the wings and other parts. The airscrews, built from their\r\nown calculations, gave in useful work two-thirds of the power expended.\r\nBefore trying this machine, however, they continued their practice with\r\nthe old glider, and made a number of flights in which they remained in\r\nthe air for over a minute, often soaring for a considerable time in one\r\nspot, without any descent at all.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the season, the 17th of December 1903, when they first\r\ntried the power machine. A general invitation to be present at the trial\r\nhad been given to the people living within five or six miles, but 'not\r\nmany were willing to face the rigours of a cold December wind in order\r\nto see, as they no doubt thought, another flying machine _not_ fly'.\r\nFive persons besides the brothers were present. Mr. Orville Wright's\r\nnarrative, written for the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain, must\r\nbe given in his own words:\r\n\r\n'On the morning of December 17th, between the hours of 10.30 o'clock and\r\nnoon, four flights were made, two by Mr. Orville Wright, and two by Mr.\r\nWilbur Wright. The starts were all made from a point on the levels, and\r\nabout 200 feet west of our camp, which is located about a quarter of a\r\nmile north of the Kill Devil Sand Hill, in Dare County, North Carolina.\r\nThe wind at the time of the flights had a velocity of twenty-seven miles\r\nan hour at 10 o'clock, and 24 miles an hour at noon, as recorded by the\r\nanemometer at the Kitty Hawk weather bureau station. This anemometer is\r\n30 feet from the ground. Our own measurements, made with a\r\nhand-anemometer at a height of four feet from the ground, showed a\r\nvelocity of about 22 miles when the first flight was made, and 20-1/2\r\nmiles at the time of the last one. The flights were directly against the\r\nwind. Each time the machine started from the level ground by its own\r\npower alone, with no assistance from gravity or any other sources\r\nwhatever. After a run of about 40 feet along a mono-rail track, which\r\nheld the machine eight inches from the ground, it rose from the track\r\nand, under the direction of the operator, climbed upward on an inclined\r\ncourse till a height of 8 or 10 feet from the ground was reached, after\r\nwhich the course was kept as near horizontal as the wind gusts and the\r\nlimited skill of the operator would permit. Into the teeth of a December\r\ngale the Flyer made its way forward with a speed of 10 miles an hour\r\nover the ground, and 30 to 35 miles an hour through the air. It had\r\npreviously been decided that, for reasons of personal safety, these\r\nfirst trials should be made as close to the ground as possible. The\r\nheight chosen was scarcely sufficient for manoeuvring in so gusty a wind\r\nand with no previous acquaintance with the conduct of the machine and\r\nits controlling mechanisms. Consequently the first flight was short. The\r\nsucceeding flights rapidly increased in length and at the fourth trial a\r\nflight of 59 seconds was made, in which time the machine flew a little\r\nmore than a half-mile through the air and a distance of 852 feet over\r\nthe ground. The landing was due to a slight error of judgement on the\r\npart of the operator. After passing over a little hummock of sand, in\r\nattempting to bring the machine down to the desired height the operator\r\nturned the rudder too far, and the machine turned downward more quickly\r\nthan had been expected. The reverse movement of the rudder was a\r\nfraction of a second too late to prevent the machine from touching the\r\nground and thus ending the flight. The whole occurrence occupied little,\r\nif any, more than one second of time.\r\n\r\n'Only those who are acquainted with practical aeronautics can appreciate\r\nthe difficulties of attempting the first trials of a flying machine in a\r\n25-mile gale. As winter was already well set in, we should have\r\npostponed our trials to a more favourable season, but for the fact that\r\nwe were determined, before returning home, to know whether the machine\r\npossessed sufficient power to fly, sufficient strength to withstand the\r\nshock of landings, and sufficient capacity of control to make flight\r\nsafe in boisterous winds, as well as in calm air. When these points had\r\nbeen definitely established, we at once packed our goods and returned\r\nhome, knowing that the age of the flying machine had come at last.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE AEROPLANE AND THE AIRSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe age of the flying machine had come at last. A power-driven aeroplane\r\nhad been built, and had been flown under the control of its pilot. What\r\nremained to do was to practise with it and test it; to improve it, and\r\nperfect it, and put it on the market. The time allowed for all this was\r\nnot long; in less than eleven years, if only the world had known it, the\r\nworld would be at war, and would be calling for aeroplanes by the\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nRomance, for all that it is inspired by real events, is never quite like\r\nreal life. It makes much of prominent dates and crises, and passes\r\nlightly and carelessly over the intervening shallows and flats. Yet\r\nthese shallows and flats are the place where human endurance and purpose\r\nare most severely tested. The problem of flight had been solved; the\r\npeople of the world, it might be expected, springing to attention, would\r\nsalute the new invention, and welcome the new era. Nothing of the kind\r\nhappened. America, which is more famous for journalistic activity than\r\nany other country on earth, remained profoundly inattentive. The Wrights\r\nreturned to their home at Dayton, and there continued their experiments.\r\n\r\nA legend has grown up that these experiments were conducted under a\r\nclose-drawn veil of secrecy. On the contrary, the proceedings of the\r\nbrothers were singularly public--indeed, for the preservation of their\r\ntitle to their own invention, almost dangerously public. 'In the spring\r\nof 1904,' says Wilbur Wright, through the kindness of Mr. Torrence\r\nHuffman, of Dayton, Ohio, we were permitted to erect a shed, and to\r\ncontinue experiments, on what is known as the Huffman Prairie, at Simms\r\nStation, eight miles east of Dayton. The new machine was heavier and\r\nstronger, but similar to the one flown at Kill Devil Hill. When it was\r\nready for its first trial every newspaper in Dayton was notified, and\r\nabout a dozen representatives of the Press were present. Our only\r\nrequest was that no pictures be taken, and that the reports be\r\nunsensational, so as not to attract crowds to our experiment grounds.\r\nThere were probably fifty persons altogether on the ground. When\r\npreparations had been completed a wind of only three or four miles was\r\nblowing--insufficient for starting on so short a track--but since many\r\nhad come a long way to see the machine in action, an attempt was made.\r\nTo add to the other difficulty, the engine refused to work properly. The\r\nmachine, after running the length of the track, slid off the end without\r\nrising into the air at all. Several of the newspaper men returned again\r\nthe next day, but were again disappointed. The engine performed badly,\r\nand after a glide of only sixty feet the machine came to the ground.\r\nFurther trial was postponed till the motor could be put in better\r\nrunning condition. The reporters had now, no doubt, lost confidence in\r\nthe machine, though their reports, in kindness, concealed it. Later,\r\nwhen they heard that we were making flights of several minutes'\r\nduration, knowing that longer flights had been made with airships, and\r\nnot knowing any essential difference between airships and flying\r\nmachines, they were but little interested.'\r\n\r\nThe indifference and scepticism of the public and the press provided a\r\nvery effective veil of secrecy, and the brothers prosecuted their\r\nresearches undisturbed. In 1904 they made more than a hundred flights,\r\npractising turning movements and complete circles, and learning how to\r\nhandle the machine so as to prevent it from 'stalling', that is, from\r\nlosing flying speed and falling to earth out of control when the air\r\nresistance caused by its manoeuvring reduced its speed. In 1905 they\r\nbuilt another machine and resumed their experiments in the same field.\r\nThey did not want to attract a crowd. The cars on the electric line\r\nadjoining the field ran every thirty minutes, and they timed their\r\nflights between the runs. The farmers living near by saw the flying, but\r\ntheir business was with the earth, not the air, and after looking on for\r\ntwo years they lost what little interest they had. On the 5th of October\r\n1905 one of them, from a neighbouring field, saw the great white form\r\nrushing round on its circular course in the air. 'Well,' he remarked,\r\n'the boys are at it again'; and he kept on cutting corn. The season's\r\nwork is summarized by Mr. Orville Wright in a letter dated the 17th of\r\nNovember 1905, and communicated to the Aeronautical Society of Great\r\nBritain:\r\n\r\n'Up to September 6 we had the machine on but eight different days,\r\ntesting a number of changes which we had made since 1904.... During the\r\nmonth of September we gradually improved in our practice, and on the\r\n26th made a flight of a little over eleven miles. On the 30th we\r\nincreased this to twelve and one-fifth miles, on October 3 to fifteen\r\nand one-third miles, on October 4 to twenty and three-fourth miles, and\r\non the 5th to twenty-four and one-fourth miles. All of these flights\r\nwere made at about thirty-eight miles an hour, the flight of the 5th\r\noccupying thirty minutes three seconds.... We had intended to place the\r\nrecord above the hour, but the attention these flights were beginning to\r\nattract compelled us suddenly to discontinue our experiments in order\r\nto prevent the construction of the machine from becoming public.\r\n\r\n'The machine passed through all of these flights without the slightest\r\ndamage. In each of these flights we returned frequently to the\r\nstarting-point, passing high over the heads of the spectators.'\r\n\r\nA young druggist called Foust, a friend of the Wrights, was present at\r\nthe flight of the 5th of October. He was told not to divulge what he had\r\nseen, but his enthusiasm would not be restrained, and he talked to such\r\neffect that next day the field was crowded with sightseers and the\r\nfences were lined with photographers. Very reluctantly the brothers\r\nended their work for the year. They took apart their flyer, and brought\r\nit back to the city.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on, for a period of almost three years, the brothers\r\ndisappear from view. The secrets which it had cost them so much time and\r\neffort to discover might, by a single photograph, be made into public\r\nproperty. They were bound to do what they could to assert their claim to\r\ntheir own invention. Their first task was to secure patent rights in\r\ntheir machine; and, after that, to negotiate with the American, French,\r\nand British Governments for its purchase. The bringer of so great a gift\r\nas flight is worthy of his reward; but the attitude of the brothers to\r\ntheir hard-won possession was not selfish or commercial. They thought\r\nmore of their responsibilities than of their profits; and in attempting\r\nto dispose of their machine they handled the matter as if it were a\r\npublic trust. These years were full of disappointment, much unlike the\r\nearlier years of progress and open-air holiday and happiness. No one,\r\nexcept a few intimates and disciples, believed in the Wrights'\r\nachievements. The American Government would not touch their invention.\r\nWhen it was thrice offered to the British Government, between the years\r\n1906 and 1908, it was thrice refused, twice by the War Office and once\r\nby the Admiralty. At an earlier period the French Government, more\r\nactive than the other two, sent Captain Ferber, who had made many\r\ngliding experiments of his own, to report after viewing the machine at\r\nDayton. The Wrights refused to show it to him, but their account of what\r\nthey had done impressed him by its truthfulness, and he reported in\r\ntheir favour, though he told them that there was not a man in all France\r\nwho believed that they had done what they claimed. The French Government\r\nwould not buy; and things were at a standstill, until Mr. Hart O. Berg,\r\na good man of business who had helped the Wrights to secure their\r\npatents, urged on them the necessity of putting in an appearance in\r\nEurope and showing what they could do. By this time they had made\r\nvarious improvements, especially in their engine, and had supplied\r\nthemselves with two machines. With one of these, in the summer of 1908,\r\nWilbur Wright came to France; with the other Orville Wright was to\r\nattempt to secure the contract in America for an army aeroplane. A\r\nFrench syndicate had agreed to buy the Wright patents and a certain\r\nnumber of machines on condition that two flights of not less than fifty\r\nkilometres each should be made in a single week, the machines to carry a\r\npassenger or an equivalent weight, and the flights to be made in a wind\r\nof not less than eleven metres a second, that is, about twenty-five\r\nmiles an hour. The conditions for the American army contract were no\r\nless severe. The machine was to remain in continuous flight for at least\r\nan hour; it was to be steered in all directions; and was to land,\r\nwithout damage, at its starting-point. The place chosen for the French\r\ntests was the Hunaudieres racecourse, near Le Mans. There Wilbur Wright\r\nset up his shed, and, from the 8th of August onward, made many little\r\nflights, showing his complete control of his machine by the elaborate\r\nmanoeuvres which he performed in the air. On the 9th of September there\r\ncame the news that Orville Wright had flown for over an hour at Fort\r\nMyer in America. This liberated Wilbur Wright, who had been holding back\r\nin order to give America the precedence, and on the 21st of September he\r\nflew for more than an hour and a half, covering a distance of over sixty\r\nmiles. About three weeks later he fulfilled the conditions of his test\r\nby successive passenger-carrying flights. Encouraged by his example, two\r\ndistinguished French pioneers, Henri Farman and Leon Delagrange, soon\r\nbegan to make long flights on French machines, and from this time\r\nonwards the progress of flying was rapid and immense. A great industry\r\ncame into being, and, after a short time, ceased to pay any tribute\r\nwhatever to the inventors. Merely to secure recognition of their\r\npriority, it became necessary for the Wrights to bring actions at law\r\nagainst the infringers of their patents. The tedious and distasteful\r\nbusiness of these law-suits troubled and shortened the days of Wilbur\r\nWright, who died at Dayton on the 30th of May 1912. In 1913, by\r\narrangement between the parties, a test action was begun against the\r\nBritish Government. When the war broke out, and the trial of this action\r\nwas still pending, the supporters of the Wrights hastily met, and\r\noffered to forgo all their claims for fifteen thousand pounds, a sum\r\nsubstantial enough to establish the Wrights' priority, yet merely\r\nnominal as a payment for the benefits conferred. So the matter was\r\nsettled. The last thoughts of Wilbur Wright were given, not to financial\r\nprofits, but to further developments of the art of flight. He was\r\nconstantly meditating on the possibility of soaring flight, which should\r\ntake advantage of the wind currents, and maintain the machine in the air\r\nwith but little expenditure of power. In a letter written not many days\r\nbefore he died, and addressed to a German aviator at the Johannisthal\r\nflying camp, he says, 'There must be a method whereby human beings can\r\nremain in the air once they really find themselves aloft.... The birds\r\ncan do it. Why shouldn't men?' The coming of the war, with its\r\nperemptory demand for power and yet more power, did much to develop\r\nstrong flight, but postponed experiment on this delicate and fascinating\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nThe name of the Wrights is so much the greatest name in the history of\r\nflying that it is only fair to give their achievements a separate place.\r\nIn 1905 they were in possession of a practical flying machine. In 1908\r\nthey proved their powers and established their claims in the sight of\r\nthe world. During these three years events had not stood still; European\r\ninventors were busy with experiments. There were rumours of the American\r\nsuccess, but the rumours were disbelieved, and the problem was attacked\r\nagain from the beginning. Long after the Wrights had circled in the air,\r\nat their own free will, over the Huffman Prairie, European inventors\r\nwere establishing records, as they believed, by hopping off the ground\r\nfor a few yards in machines of their own construction.\r\n\r\nThe earliest of these European pioneers was Mr. I. C. H. Ellehammer, a\r\nDanish engineer, who had built motor-cycles and light cars. In 1904 he\r\nbuilt a flying machine, and having prepared a ground in the small Danish\r\nisland of Lindholm, suspended the machine by a wire attached to a\r\ncentral mast, and tested its lifting power. In the course of his\r\nexperiments he increased his engine-power, and added to the first\r\nbird-like pair of wings a second pair placed above them. With this\r\nimproved machine he claims to have made, on the 12th of September 1906,\r\nthe first free flight in Europe, travelling in the air for forty-two\r\nmetres at a height of a metre and a half. With later machines he had\r\nsome successes, but the rapid progress of French aviation left him\r\nbehind, and his latest invention was an application to the aeroplane of\r\na helicopter, to raise it vertically in the air. The helicopter idea\r\ncontinues to fascinate some inventors, and it would be rash to condemn\r\nit, but the most it seems to promise is a flight like that of the\r\nlark--an almost vertical ascent and a glide to earth again. A machine of\r\nthis kind might conceivably, at some future time, become a substitute,\r\nin war, for the kite balloon; it is not likely to supersede the\r\naeroplane.\r\n\r\nOf all European countries France was the most intelligent and the most\r\nalert in taking up the problem of flight. The enduring rivalry between\r\nthe airship and the flying machine is well illustrated in the history of\r\nFrench effort. Long before the first true flying machine was built and\r\nflown balloons of a fish-like shape had been driven through the air by\r\nmechanical airscrews. A bird is much heavier than the air it displaces;\r\na fish is about the same weight as the water it displaces; and the\r\nquestion which of the two examples is better for aircraft, whether\r\nflying or swimming is the better mode, remained an open question,\r\ndividing opinion and distracting effort. The debate is not yet\r\nconcluded. It is now not very hazardous to say that both methods are\r\ngood, and that the partisans of the one side and the other were right in\r\ntheir faith and wrong in their heresy-hunting. National rivalry\r\ncertainly quickened the competition between the two modes; the early\r\nprogress of aviation in France gave a great impulse to the development\r\nof the Zeppelin in Germany. But the two modes are so entirely distinct\r\nthat they are better treated separately. None of the chief nations of\r\nthe world has dared wholly to neglect either; from the very beginning\r\nthe two have grown up side by side, and interest has been concentrated\r\nnow on the one and now on the other. When, in 1912, Great Britain took\r\nin hand the creation of an air force, military and naval, France was\r\nalready furnished with a very large number of aeroplanes, organized for\r\nservice with the army, and Germany was provided with airships of\r\nunprecedented power and range. France also had some airships, and\r\nGermany, alarmed by the progress of French aviation, had begun to turn\r\nher attention to aeroplanes, but the pride of Germany was in her\r\nairships, and the pride of France was in her aeroplanes. These were the\r\nconditions with which Great Britain had to reckon; they had grown up\r\nrapidly in the course of a few years; and it will be convenient to speak\r\nfirst of the airship, which, invented by France, was adopted and\r\nimproved by Germany; and then of the aeroplane, which was made by France\r\ninto so formidable a military engine that Germany had no choice but to\r\nimitate again. Meantime Great Britain, during the earlier years of these\r\ndevelopments, entrusted her aerial fortunes to a few balloons, which\r\nwere operated by the Royal Engineers and were not very favourably\r\nregarded by the chiefs of the army. The unpreparedness of Great Britain\r\nin all national crises is a time-honoured theme. The Englishman, if he\r\ndoes not wholly distrust science, at least distrusts theory. Facts\r\nexcite him, and rouse him to exertion. In an address delivered in 1910,\r\nMr. R. B. Haldane, who consistently did all that he could to promote and\r\nencourage science, uttered a prophecy which deserves record. 'When a new\r\ninvention,' he said, 'like the submarine or the motor, comes to light,\r\nthe Englishman is usually behind. Give him a few years and he has not\r\nonly taken care of himself in the meantime, but is generally leading. As\r\nit was with these inventions, so I suspect it will prove to be with\r\naircraft.'\r\n\r\nThe airship, like the balloon, was a French invention. When the balloon\r\nfirst came into vogue many attempts were made to deflect or guide its\r\ncourse by the use of oars. Those who made these attempts were almost\r\nunanimous in declaring that the use of oars enabled them to alter the\r\ncourse of a balloon by several points of the compass. Another method of\r\nsteering employed sails, held up to the wind by the drag of a guide-rope\r\non the ground. The control to be obtained by means like these was\r\npathetically small, and the real problem was soon seen to be the problem\r\nof a motor. The spherical balloon is obviously unsuited for\r\npower-navigation; in 1784, only a year after the invention of the\r\nballoon, General Meusnier, of the French army, made designs for an\r\negg-shaped power-balloon to be driven by three airscrews, supported on\r\nthe rigging between the car and the balloon. To keep the balloon fully\r\ninflated and stiff, in order to drive it against the wind, he planned a\r\ndouble envelope, the inner space to contain hydrogen, the outer space to\r\nbe pumped full of air. He may thus be said to have invented the\r\nballonet, or air-chamber of the balloon, and to be the father of later\r\nsuccessful airships. His designs were mere descriptions; they could not\r\nbe carried out; there was at that time no light engine in existence, and\r\nhis own suggestion that the airscrews should be worked by manual labour\r\nmay be called a design for an engine that weighs something over half a\r\nton for every horse-power of energy exerted. In 1798 the French author\r\nBeaumarchais recommended the construction of airships in the long shape\r\nof a fish. As the years passed, models were made on this plan. In 1834\r\nMr. Monck Mason exhibited at the Lowther Arcade in London a model\r\nairship, thirteen and a half feet long, and six and a half feet in\r\ndiameter; its airscrew was operated by a spring; it was fitted with\r\nhorizontal planes for setting its course; and in its very short flights\r\nit attained a speed of something over five miles an hour. A larger\r\nmodel, with two airscrews driven by clockwork, was exhibited in 1850 by\r\nM. Jullien, a clockmaker of Paris, and flew successfully against a\r\nslight breeze. The first successful man-carrying airship was built in\r\n1852 by Henry Giffard, the French engineer, and was flown at Paris on\r\nthe 24th of September in that year. It was spindle-shaped, with a\r\ncapacity of 87,000 cubic feet, and a length of 144 feet. The airscrew,\r\nten feet in diameter, was driven by a steam-engine of three horse-power,\r\nand the speed attained was about six miles an hour. It would take long\r\nto record all the unsuccessful or partially successful experiments in\r\nthe history of the airship--the elaborately constructed ships which\r\nnever rose from the ground, the carefully thought out devices which did\r\nnot work. Progress was very slow and gradual, a mere residue in a\r\nhistory of failures. The first use of the gas-engine was in an Austrian\r\ndirigible, which made a single captive ascent at Brunn in 1872, and\r\ndeveloped a speed of three miles an hour. After 1870 the reconstituted\r\nFrench Government showed itself willing to encourage aeronautics, and in\r\n1872, at the cost of the State, a large dirigible was built by Dupuy de\r\nLome, the inventor of the ironclad. This ship, with an airscrew driven\r\nby manpower, attained a speed of five and a half miles an hour. The\r\nfirst really successful power-driven airship, that is, the first airship\r\nto return to its starting-point at the end of a successful voyage, was\r\nbuilt in 1884 for the French army by Captain Krebs and Captain Charles\r\nRenard, who subsequently became director of the French department of\r\nmilitary aeronautics. This dirigible, named _La France_, was\r\nfish-shaped; its length was a hundred and sixty-five feet; its greatest\r\ndiameter, near the bows, was twenty-seven and a half feet, or one-sixth\r\nof its length; it was fitted with an electric motor of eight and a half\r\nhorse-power which operated an airscrew of twenty-three feet in diameter,\r\nsituated in front of the car; it was steered by vertical and horizontal\r\nrudders, and made several ascents in the neighbourhood of Meudon. It was\r\nthe progenitor and type of all later non-rigid dirigibles.\r\n\r\nThe success of _La France_ brought Germany into the field. Towards the\r\nclose of the century a German engineer called Woelfert constructed a\r\ndirigible rather smaller than the French airship, with a slightly more\r\npowerful engine, and two airscrews of twelve feet in diameter. This was\r\nin one respect a forerunner of the most famous of the German airships,\r\nfor the car, instead of hanging loose, was rigidly connected to the\r\nenvelope by means of struts. The trials took place in 1896 at Tempelhof,\r\nnear Berlin; the airship was held captive by ropes; it answered well to\r\nits rudders, and attained a speed of about nine miles an hour.\r\nEncouraged by this experiment, Dr. Woelfert in the following year built a\r\nsecond smaller dirigible, fitted with a Daimler benzine motor, and made\r\na free ascent in it on the 14th of June 1897, near Berlin. As soon as it\r\nwas well in the air, the ship caught fire and fell flaming to the\r\nground, killing Dr. Woelfert and his assistant. Later in the same year\r\nthe first completely rigid dirigible was built by a German called David\r\nSchwarz; it was made of thin aluminium sheeting, internally braced by\r\nsteel wires, and was driven by a twelve horse-power Daimler motor which\r\nworked twin airscrews, one on either side. It took the air near Berlin\r\non the 3rd of November 1897, but something went wrong with the airscrew\r\nbelts, and it was seriously damaged in its hasty descent. Thereupon the\r\ncrowd of people who had assembled to applaud it fell upon it, and\r\nwrecked it. The behaviour of the crowd deserves a passing mention in any\r\nhistory of flight; it was not the least of the ordeals of the early\r\naeronaut. The aeroplane or airship pilot who disappointed the\r\nexpectations of his public found no better treatment than Christian and\r\nFaithful met with in Bunyan's Vanity Fair. There is here no question of\r\nnational weaknesses; in France and Germany, in England and America, the\r\nthing has happened again and again. If an ascent was announced, and was\r\nput off because the weather was bad, the crowd jeered, and hooted, and\r\nthrew stones. On more than one occasion a pilot has been driven by the\r\ntaunts of the crowd to attempt an impossible ascent; and has met his\r\ndeath. If a damaged machine fell to earth, the crowd often wreaked their\r\nvengeance on it, as deer fall upon a wounded comrade. The men who made\r\nup the crowd were most of them kind and trustworthy in their private\r\nrelations, and in matters that they understood were not unreasonable or\r\ninconsiderate. But aerial navigation was a new thing, and their attitude\r\nto it was wholly spectacular. They came to see it because they craved\r\nexcitement, and under the influence of that cruel passion they were\r\ncapable of the worst excesses of the Roman populace at a gladiatorial\r\nshow.\r\n\r\nIn the years that joined the centuries, that is, from 1898 to 1903,\r\naviation seemed a forlorn hope, but there was great activity in the\r\nconstruction of airships, and something like a race for supremacy\r\nbetween France and Germany. In 1898 the Brazilian, Alberto Santos\r\nDumont, made his first gallant appearance in an airship of his own\r\nconstruction. Born in 1873, the son of a prosperous coffee-planter of\r\nSan Paulo in Brazil, Santos Dumont was a young and wealthy amateur,\r\ngifted with mechanical genius, and insensible to danger. The accidents\r\nand perils that he survived in his many aerial adventures would have\r\nkilled a cat. One of his airships collapsed and fell with him on to the\r\nroofs of Paris. Another collapsed and fell with him into the\r\nMediterranean. A third caught fire in the air, and he beat out the\r\nflames with his Panama hat. He survived these and other mishaps, unhurt,\r\nand after making more than a hundred ascents in airships, turned his\r\nattention to aeroplanes, and was the first man to rise from French soil\r\nin a flying machine. From his boyhood mechanisms had attracted him; he\r\nwas well acquainted with all the machines on his father's plantation,\r\nand he records an observation that he made there--the only bad machine\r\non the plantation, he says, was an agitating sieve; the good machines\r\nall worked on the rotary principle. He became a champion of the wheel,\r\nand of the rotary principle. There was something of the fierceness of\r\ntheological dispute in the controversies of these early days. The wheel,\r\nit was pointed out, is not in nature; it is a pedantic invention of man.\r\nBirds do not employ it to fly with, nor fish to swim with. The\r\nnaturalist school of aeronauts declared against it. In 1892 M. A. le\r\nCompagnon made experiments, not very successfully, in Paris, with a\r\ncaptive dirigible balloon driven by a pair of oscillating wings. As late\r\nas 1904 Mr. Thomas Moy, in a paper read to the Aeronautical Society of\r\nGreat Britain, maintained that the greatest hindrances to the solution\r\nof the problem of mechanical flight have always been the balloon and the\r\nairscrew. Mr. William Cochrane, in a paper read a few months earlier,\r\nlaid it down that the airscrew must give place to a more efficient form\r\nof propulsion. Utterances like these help to explain the fervour with\r\nwhich Santos Dumont, in the book called _My Airships_ (1904), defends\r\nthe rotary principle, which is the life of machines. Like the Wrights,\r\nhe believed in practice, and was a skilled and experienced balloonist\r\nbefore he attempted to navigate an airship. His first airship was almost\r\nabsurdly small; it had little more than six thousand feet of cubic\r\ncapacity, was cigar-shaped, and was driven by a three and a half\r\nhorse-power petrol motor. The others followed in rapid succession. M.\r\nDeutsch de la Meurthe had offered a prize of a hundred thousand francs\r\nfor the first airship that should rise from the Aero Club ground at St.\r\nCloud and voyage round the Eiffel Tower, returning within half an hour\r\nto its starting-point. On the 19th of October 1901 the prize was won by\r\nSantos Dumont in the sixth of his airships. The ship had over twenty-two\r\nthousand feet of cubic capacity; its length was more than five times its\r\ndiameter; and it was driven by a twelve horse-power petrol motor. It\r\ntravelled six and three-quarter miles within the half-hour, part of the\r\njourney being accomplished against a wind of about twelve miles an hour.\r\nThis achievement quickened interest in airships and gained a European\r\nfame for Santos Dumont. His later airships were modelled on the egg\r\nrather than the cigar; the smallest of these was so perfectly under\r\ncontrol that he was able, he says, to navigate it by night through the\r\nstreets of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe development of the airship continued for many years to pay toll in\r\nwreckage and loss of life. In 1902 three notable airships were built and\r\nflown in France; two of these were destroyed in the air above Paris,\r\nwithin a few minutes of their first ascent. Senhor Augusto Severo, a\r\nBrazilian, made a spindle-shaped airship, ninety-eight feet long, driven\r\nby two airscrews, placed one at each end of a framework which formed the\r\nlongitudinal axis of the airship. It ascended on the 12th of May, and\r\nwhen it had reached a height of thirteen hundred feet, exploded in\r\nflames. Senhor Severo and his assistant perished in it. The other ship\r\nwas designed by Baron Bradsky, secretary to the German Embassy in Paris;\r\nits total weight was made exactly equivalent to the weight of the air\r\nthat it displaced, and it was to be raised by the operation of an\r\nairscrew rotating horizontally under the car. By the action of this\r\nscrew the car itself began to rotate, and to drag the ship round with\r\nit; the resistance of the air on the body of the ship put too great a\r\nstrain on the steel wires by which the car was suspended; they broke,\r\nand from a height of many hundred feet Baron Bradsky and his engineer,\r\nM. Morin, fell to earth with the car, and were killed. This second\r\ndisaster happened on the 13th of October 1902, at Stains, near Paris.\r\nTwelve days later, on the 25th of October, a much more fortunate\r\nairship, the dirigible built for the brothers Lebaudy, made its first\r\nascent at Moisson. This vessel was more successful than any of its\r\npredecessors, and became the model for airships of the semi-rigid type.\r\nIt was fish-shaped, with a capacity of more than eighty thousand cubic\r\nfeet, and was driven by a forty horse-power Daimler petrol motor, which\r\nworked two airscrews, eight feet in diameter, at a rate exceeding a\r\nthousand revolutions a minute. The lower part of the envelope was flat,\r\nand secured to a rigid metal framework; six steel tubes, attached to\r\nthis framework, supported the car below, and, besides distributing the\r\nload, conveyed the thrust of the airscrew to the ship above. In the\r\ncourse of a year the ship made twenty-eight return journeys, covering\r\ndistances up to twenty-two miles. In November 1903 it broke all records,\r\nfirst by making the longest voyage that had ever been made by a\r\nnavigable balloon, that is, from Moisson to Paris, a distance of about\r\nforty miles, and next, a week later, by successfully combating a wind of\r\nmore than twenty miles an hour. 'Aerial navigation', said Colonel\r\nRenard, who witnessed this trial, 'is no longer a Utopia.' After a time\r\nthe ship was taken over by the French army, and its immediate Lebaudy\r\nsuccessors, _La Patrie_ of 1906 and _La Republique_ of 1908, also became\r\nmilitary airships. Both were wrecked after a short career, but the\r\nmilitary airship had made good its promise, and three new\r\nairship-building firms were established in France. In 1902 the Astra\r\nCompany, in 1909 and 1910 the Zodiac Company and the Clement-Bayard\r\nCompany, began to build airships, some for the French army and some for\r\nforeign powers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at the time when Santos Dumont was gaining credit for the\r\nsmallest airship ever known, the largest known airship had been designed\r\nand launched in Germany. On the 2nd of July 1900 the first Zeppelin made\r\nits trial trip from the floating shed at Manzell, near Friedrichshafen,\r\non Lake Constance. When the Great War shall be only a faded memory, when\r\nthe sufferings of millions of men and women shall be condensed into\r\nmatter for handbooks, and their sacrifices shall be expressed only in\r\narithmetical figures, certain incidents and names, because they caught\r\nthe popular imagination, will still be narrated and repeated. The names\r\nthat will live are the names that symbolize the causes for which they\r\nstood. Edith Cavell will never be forgotten; when she persevered in her\r\nwork of mercy, and calmly faced the ultimate cruelties of a monstrous\r\nsystem, all that was best in the war seemed to find expression in that\r\nlonely passion. She was brought home to England in a warship, and was\r\ncarried to her grave on a gun-carriage, under the Union Jack, because\r\nher cause was her country's cause, and England claimed a title in her\r\nsacrifice. It is a far cry from Edith Cavell to the old soldier who gave\r\nGermany the giant airship, but the Zeppelin will also be remembered,\r\nbecause the popular imagination, which is often both just and fanciful,\r\nfound a symbol of Germany's cause in this engine of terror, so carefully\r\nand admirably planned down to the minutest detail, so impressive by its\r\nbulk, so indiscriminate in its destructive action, and so frail. Its\r\ninventor was Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, a Lieutenant-General in the\r\nGerman army. His first balloon ascent had been made during the American\r\nCivil War, in one of the military balloons of the Federal army. Later\r\non, in the Franco-Prussian War, he distinguished himself by his daring\r\ncavalry reconnaissances in Alsace. At about that time there was in\r\nAlsace a Frenchman named Spiess, who had drawn a design for a rigid\r\nairship not unlike the later Zeppelin, and had endeavoured, without\r\nsuccess, to patent it. The suggestion has been made, but with no proof,\r\nthat Count Zeppelin may have seen Spiess's plans, and borrowed from\r\nthem. If so, the borrowed idea took long in maturing. It was not until\r\n1898 that the Count went to work on a large scale, and formed a company\r\nwith a capital of a million marks. It was not until 1908, after ten\r\nyears of struggle and disaster, that the German Government made him a\r\ngrant for the continuance of his experiments, and the German people,\r\nimpressed by his pertinacity and courage in misfortune, raised for him a\r\nsubscription of three hundred thousand pounds, to enable him to build\r\nthe great airship works at Friedrichshafen. From this time the Zeppelin\r\nwas a national ship. Sheds to harbour airships were built at strategic\r\npoints on the western and eastern fronts, and plans were set on foot to\r\nhouse naval Zeppelins at Heligoland, Emden, and Kiel. With\r\ncharacteristic German thoroughness a network of weather stations on\r\nGerman soil, and, it is believed, of secret weather reports from other\r\ncountries, was provided for the guidance of airship pilots. All this was\r\na monument to the perseverance, which might almost be called obstinacy,\r\nof the indomitable Count. He built enormous and costly airships, one\r\nafter another; one after another they were wrecked or burnt, and then he\r\nbuilt more. The German people watched him as King Robert the Bruce\r\nwatched the spider, with a scepticism that was gradually turned into\r\nwonder, till, in the end, when disaster after disaster found him willing\r\npatiently to begin again, they resolved to make him their teacher and to\r\ntake a lesson from him.\r\n\r\nCount Zeppelin was about sixty years old when he began to make airships;\r\nhe had been long studying the problem and preparing his plans; so that\r\nhis many airships do not much differ among themselves in general design,\r\nand a description of the first gives a fair enough idea of its\r\nsuccessors. It was a pencil-shaped rigid structure, about four hundred\r\nand twenty feet long, with a diameter almost exactly one-eleventh part\r\nof its length. The framework, built of aluminium, consisted of sixteen\r\nhoops, connected by longitudinal pieces, and kept rigid by diagonal wire\r\nstays. Before it was covered it resembled a vast bird-cage, and looked\r\nas frail as a cobweb, but was stronger and stiffer than it looked. It\r\nwas divided by aluminium bulkheads into seventeen compartments; of these\r\nall but the two end compartments contained separate balloons or\r\ngas-bags. Two or three of these might collapse without completely\r\ndestroying the buoyancy of the ship. The whole structure was covered\r\nwith a fabric of rubberized cotton. A triangular latticed aluminium keel\r\nran along below, to give strength to the ship, and to furnish a\r\npassage-way from end to end. At points about a third of the way from\r\neither end of the ship spaces in the keel were made for the two cars, in\r\neach of which was a sixteen horse-power Daimler motor driving two small\r\nhigh velocity airscrews, one on each side of the ship. The lateral\r\nsteering was done by a large vertical rudder, placed aft. The\r\nlongitudinal balance was controlled in several ways. In the first ship a\r\nheavy sliding weight in the keel was moved at will, fore and aft. This\r\nwas supplemented or superseded in later ships by four sets of elevating\r\nplanes, two sets in the fore-part and two sets aft. An advantage of the\r\nrigid ship is that she can tilt herself without danger from the pressure\r\nof the gas on the higher end. Moreover, she can be driven at a very high\r\nspeed, and the gas-bags, being housed in the compartments and protected\r\nfrom the outer air, are less liable to sudden contraction and expansion\r\ncaused by variations of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe great disadvantage of the rigid type has hitherto been that in bad\r\nweather the airship cannot land. A non-rigid airship in a nasty wind can\r\nland and deflate itself at once by ripping the panel in the envelope, at\r\nno greater price than the loss of its gas, and probably some damage to\r\nits car. To land in a rigid ship is at best a ticklish business; indeed,\r\nthe rigid airship is in exactly the same case as a large sea-going\r\nvessel; its chief dangers are from the land, which it cannot touch with\r\nimpunity. Its troubles have been greatly diminished, since the war, by\r\nthe development of the mooring-mast, which does away with the necessity\r\nof housing the ship after every flight. The prevailing type of weather\r\nin this country is unsettled, and the changes in the force and direction\r\nof the wind are rapid and numerous. The landing and housing of an\r\nairship demands hundreds of men for its performance, and is not safely\r\nto be undertaken in a wind that blows more than eighteen miles an hour.\r\nA staff of from eight to ten men is sufficient to anchor a large airship\r\nto a mooring-mast, where it has been proved by experiment that she can\r\nsafely ride out a wind that blows fifty miles an hour. At Pulham, our\r\nlargest airship station, which was taken over from the Royal Air Force\r\nby the Controller-General of Civil Aviation in December 1920, a number\r\nof valuable experiments have since been carried out with an improvised\r\nmooring-mast, and it has been shown that with a properly designed and\r\nconstructed mast, fitted with adequate receiving gear and hauling\r\napparatus, there will be no difficulty in landing the largest rigid\r\nairships in a wind of from thirty-five to forty miles an hour. This\r\nspells an immense advance. Sheds will still be necessary for overhauls\r\nand repairs, as a dry dock is necessary for sea-going vessels. But an\r\nairship on service may be moored to the mast, as a sea-going vessel is\r\nmoored to a quay, and can take on board or discharge cargo, passengers,\r\nand fuel.\r\n\r\nThe trial trip of the first Zeppelin was short, because of accidents to\r\nthe steering-gear, but on the whole was not unsuccessful. The ship was\r\nperfectly stable, and in its voyage of three and a half miles proved\r\nthat it could make headway against a wind of sixteen miles an hour. A\r\nsecond ascent, lasting for an hour and twenty minutes, was made on the\r\n17th of October 1900. These trials were of value in discovering the\r\nfaults of the ship; in the following year it was broken up, and Count\r\nZeppelin went to work again. In his second ship of 1905 the power of\r\neach engine was increased to eighty-five horse-power, and other\r\nimprovements were made. This ship suffered many minor mishaps. At last,\r\nin January 1906, it ascended over Lake Constance to a height of 1,800\r\nfeet; then the motors failed, the helm jammed; when the ship attempted\r\nto descend the ground was frozen and the anchors would not hold, it was\r\ndriven against some trees, and a high wind arising in the night made it\r\na total wreck.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following list shows the number of Zeppelin airships built up to the\r\noutbreak of the war, and the fate of each of them:\r\n\r\n  _Zeppelin   _Year of\r\n     No._     Completion_   _Name_               _Remarks_\r\n\r\n  1             1900        L.Z.I      Broken up after experiments spring\r\n                                         1901.\r\n  2             1905        L.Z.

Dismantled\r\n                                         August 1914.\r\n\r\nThe list is full of wreckage; what it does not show is the immense\r\nprogress made in a few years. As early as 1907 Count Zeppelin made a\r\nvoyage of eight hours in his third airship, covering 211 miles. In 1909\r\nhe voyaged, in stages, from Friedrichshafen to Berlin, landing at Tegel\r\nin the presence of the Emperor on the 29th of August, and returning\r\nsafely to Friedrichshafen by the 2nd of September. But the growing\r\nefficiency of the Zeppelin and the growing confidence of the German\r\npublic are best seen in the records of passenger-carrying flights. The\r\nZeppelin Company, being founded and supported by national enterprise,\r\ndid not sell any ships to foreign powers. For passenger-carrying\r\npurposes it supplied ships to the subsidiary company usually called the\r\nDelag (that is, the Deutsche Luftschiffahrt Aktien-Gesellschaft), which\r\nhad its headquarters at Frankfort-on-the-Main. The Delag acquired six\r\nZeppelin airships, which, unlike the military and naval ships, bore\r\nnames. A record of the voyages made by the _Viktoria Luise_, the\r\n_Hansa_, and the _Sachsen_ will show how rapidly the German people were\r\nfamiliarized with the Zeppelin, and how safe air-travel became, when\r\nsafety was essential, as it is in all passenger-carrying enterprises.\r\nThe _Viktoria Luise_ made her first trip on the 4th of March 1912, with\r\ntwenty-three passengers on board, from Friedrichshafen to\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Main--a distance of about two hundred miles, which she\r\ncovered in seven and a half hours. She made her hundredth trip on the\r\n23rd of June 1912; her two-hundredth on the 21st of October in the same\r\nyear; in the following year her three-hundredth trip was made on the\r\n30th of June, and her four-hundredth on the 26th of November. In these\r\nfour hundred trips she carried 8,551 persons and travelled 29,430 miles.\r\nSome of them were made over the sea; on the 27th of June, for instance,\r\nshe left Hamburg in the morning, and reached Cuxhaven in about two\r\nhours. There she picked up with a Hamburg-America liner starting for New\r\nYork, and accompanied the steamer for some distance; then she steered\r\nfor Heligoland, and flying round the island very low was greeted with\r\ncheers by the inhabitants. Part of her return journey was made against a\r\nhead-wind of sixteen miles an hour, and she reached Hamburg after a\r\nvoyage of eight hours, during which she had covered a distance of about\r\ntwo hundred and fifty miles. The _Hansa_, beginning in July 1912, by the\r\nend of 1913 had made two hundred and seventy-five trips, carrying 5,697\r\npersons and travelling 22,319 miles. The _Sachsen_, beginning in May\r\n1913, before the end of the year had made two hundred and six trips,\r\ncarrying 4,857 persons and travelling about 13,700 miles. A wrecked\r\nZeppelin is such a picture of destruction, such a vast display of\r\ntwisted metal and rags lying wreathed across a landscape, that those who\r\nsee it are apt to get an exaggerated idea of the dangers of airship\r\ntravel. With all his misfortunes, it was Count Zeppelin's luck for many\r\nyears that no life was lost among those who travelled in his ships.\r\n\r\nIn May 1906, before Count Zeppelin's enterprise had received the\r\nstamp of Imperial and national approval, there was formed, under the\r\ninspiration of the German Emperor, a society for airship development.\r\nThe success of the Lebaudy airship in France prompted the\r\nconstruction in Germany of two types of semi-rigid airship--the\r\nParseval and the Gross. Only four of the latter type were built, and\r\nall four suffered mishap; the last and best of them, built in 1911,\r\nis said to have shown a better performance than the best contemporary\r\nZeppelin. The Parseval was designed in 1906 by Major August von Parseval,\r\nof the Third Bavarian Infantry Regiment, who retired from the German\r\narmy in 1907 in order to devote himself entirely to scientific work.\r\nHe was already famous for the kite balloon, which he had invented in\r\ncollaboration with Hauptmann Bartsch von Sigsfeld, who died in 1906.\r\nThe Parseval kite balloon was adopted or imitated by all other\r\nnations during the war. The Parseval airship was as good an airship,\r\nof the non-rigid type, as had ever been built; it was supplanted,\r\nlater on, by the rigid type, because an airship's lift depends on\r\nits size, and very large airships could not be built without a rigid\r\nframework. The society for airship development bought up Major von\r\nParseval's plans, and began to construct Parseval airships. The\r\nstatutes of the society forbade it to sell ships for profit, so an\r\nallied company was formed, the Luftfahrzeugbau-Gesellschaft, with\r\nworks at Bitterfeld, and a subsidiary company, the L.V.G., or\r\nLuftverkehrs-Gesellschaft, to exploit Parseval airships for\r\npassenger-carrying, with its headquarters at Berlin and sheds at\r\nJohannisthal. Two passenger-carrying ships were built, the\r\n_Stollwerk_ in 1910, and the _Charlotte_ in 1912. The Parseval\r\nships, perhaps because, being non-rigid, they were held to be\r\ninferior to the Zeppelins, were freely sold to foreign powers--one\r\nto the Austrian army in 1909, one to the Russian and one to the\r\nTurkish army in 1910, one to the Japanese army in 1912, another to\r\nthe Russian and two to the Italian army in 1913; last of all, in the\r\nsame year, one to the British Admiralty. Some eighteen Parseval\r\nairships were built and launched between 1909 and 1913. The third\r\ngreat airship-building company in Germany was the Schuette-Lanz\r\nCompany, with its factory in Mannheim. It was named from Heinrich\r\nLanz, the founder of machine works near Mannheim, who supplied the\r\nmoney, and Professor Schuette, of the Technical University, Danzig,\r\nwho supplied the skill. Its rigid airships were made of wood; they\r\nwere built from 1912 onwards expressly for the uses of the army and\r\nnavy, and they played a great part in the war.\r\n\r\nThose who were responsible for the development of the airship in Germany\r\ntook the people into partnership, and devoted themselves largely to\r\npassenger-carrying. The airship became popular; and the officers and men\r\nwho worked it were practised in navigation all the year round. The\r\npeople, for their part, regarded the Zeppelin with the enthusiasm of\r\npatriotic fervour. France had taken the lead and had shown the way with\r\nthe dirigible, but Germany, by recruiting the people for the cause, soon\r\nout-distanced her. The passenger ships served as training-ships for\r\ncrews, and, if occasion should arise, were readily convertible to\r\nwarlike purposes. Yet things changed and moved so fast, that before the\r\nwar broke out, although the German people still believed that the\r\nZeppelin gave them the sovereignty of the air, the German Government had\r\nbeen troubled by doubts, had changed its policy, and was striving hard\r\nto overtake the French in the construction and manning of army\r\naeroplanes. The consequence was that the war found Germany better\r\nprovided with aeroplanes for use on the western front than with airships\r\nfor operations oversea. The German Emperor, speaking to a wounded\r\nsoldier, is reported to have said that he never willed this war. One\r\nproof that this war was not the war he willed may be found in the state\r\nof preparation of the German air force. If war with England had been any\r\npart of the German plan, German airships would have been more numerous,\r\nand would have been ready for immediate action, as the armies that\r\ninvaded Belgium were ready. The German theory was that England was not\r\nprepared for war, which, with certain brilliant and crucial exceptions,\r\nwas true, and that therefore England would not go to war, which proved\r\nto be false. The French were supplying themselves with a great force of\r\naeroplanes, and for all that could be known, air operations on the\r\nwestern front might determine the fortunes of the campaign. So the\r\nGerman Government turned its attention to machines that are heavier than\r\nair.\r\n\r\nWhat had brought about this situation was the rapid and surprising\r\ndevelopment of the aeroplane by France. Here it is necessary to go back\r\nand take up the story again at the beginning of those few and headlong\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nFrench aviation derives directly from Lilienthal and collaterally from\r\nthe Wrights. The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church; but the\r\nmartyrs, for the most part, die in faith, without assurance of the\r\nharvest that is to come. When Lilienthal was killed he can hardly have\r\nknown that his example and his careful records would so soon bear fruit\r\nin other countries. He was regarded by his fellow-countrymen as a\r\nwhimsical acrobat, who took mad risks and paid the price. But as soon as\r\nhe was dead, the story of what he had done got abroad, and began to\r\nraise up for him disciples and successors, who carried on his\r\nexperiments. The chief of these in France was Captain F. Ferber, an\r\nofficer of artillery and a student of science, who from 1896 onwards was\r\na teacher in the military school at Fontainebleau. It was in 1898 that\r\nhe first came across an account of Lilienthal; the reading of it\r\nimpressed him as deeply as it impressed the Wrights. Here was a man, he\r\nthought, who had discovered the right way of learning to fly; if only\r\nthe way were followed, success was sure. Like the Wrights, Ferber lays\r\nstress chiefly on practice. It was he, not Lilienthal, who was the\r\nauthor of the saying, 'To design a flying machine is nothing; to build\r\none is nothing much; to try it in the air is everything'. In the book on\r\naviation which he wrote shortly before his death in 1909 he expounds his\r\ncreed and narrates his experiences. His mathematical knowledge, he says,\r\nserved him well, for it saved him from being condemned as an empiric by\r\nthose dogmatic men of science, very numerous in France (and, he might\r\nhave added, in the universities of all countries), who believe that\r\nscience points the way to practice, whereas the most that science can\r\ndo, says Ferber, is to follow in the wake of practice, and interpret it.\r\nSo he set himself to work on a plan as old as the world--first to create\r\nthe facts, and then to expound them in speech and writing.\r\n\r\nHe began to build gliders, but had no success with them until he found\r\nout for himself what he had not gathered from his reading of\r\nLilienthal--that an up-current of wind is necessary for a prolonged\r\nglide. His first successful flight was made with his fourth glider on\r\nthe 7th of December 1901. He got into touch with Mr. Chanute, another of\r\nLilienthal's scattered disciples, and through him was supplied with\r\npapers and photographs concerning the gliding experiments of the\r\nWrights. These were a revelation to him, and he used them in making his\r\nfifth glider, which was a great improvement on its predecessors. He\r\nlectured at Lyons to the Aero Club of the Rhone on the progress of\r\naviation by means of gliding, and published his lecture in the _Revue\r\nd'Artillerie_ of March 1904. About this time the air was full of rumours\r\nof flight. M. Ernest Archdeacon, of Paris, took up the subject with\r\nardour, wrote many articles on it, and encouraged others to work at it.\r\nA young man, called Gabriel Voisin, who heard Captain Ferber lecture at\r\nLyons, came on to the platform after the lecture and declared that he\r\nwished to devote his life to the cause of aviation. The next morning he\r\nstarted for Paris, and with the help of M. Archdeacon founded the\r\nearliest aeroplane factory in France--the firm of the brothers Voisin,\r\nwhich became the mainstay of early French aviation.\r\n\r\nFerber himself was carrying out a series of experiments at Nice with an\r\naeroplane which he fitted with a six horse-power engine and suspended\r\nfrom a tall mast, when he was invited by Colonel Renard to help with the\r\nwork of the official research laboratory at Chalais Meudon. He joined\r\nthe staff, but found that the officials of a Government organization are\r\nas ill qualified as the theorists of a university for progress in\r\npractical invention. The lower members of the hierarchy are men under\r\norders, who do what they are told to do; the higher members are hampered\r\nby having to work through subordinates, who often do not understand\r\ntheir aims and take no particular interest in the work in hand.\r\nNevertheless, he improved his aeroplane, stabilizing it by means of a\r\nlong tail, and fitting it with wheels for landing, in place of the skids\r\nwhich were used by the Wrights. Then, like those who had gone before\r\nhim, he was held up by the question of the engine. Engineers are a\r\nconservative race of men, and perhaps the perfected aeroplane would\r\nstill be waiting for a suitable engine if they had not been prompted to\r\ninnovation by the fashion of motor-racing. There are strange links in\r\nthe chain of cause and effect; the pneumatic tyre made the motor-bicycle\r\npossible; for motor-bicycle races a light engine was devised which later\r\non was adapted to the needs of the aeroplane. Ferber made acquaintance\r\nwith M. Levavasseur, who had invented an engine of eighty horse-power\r\nweighing less than five pounds per horse-power, and had won many races\r\nwith it. This engine was named the _Antoinette_ in honour of the\r\ndaughter of M. Gastambide, a capitalist, who had supplied the inventor\r\nwith funds. The most famous of early French aviators, Santos Dumont,\r\nFarman, Bleriot, Delagrange, and others, owed much to this engine.\r\nFerber might have had it before any of them, for M. Levavasseur offered\r\nto build it for him--twenty-four horse-power with a weight of about a\r\nhundred and twelve pounds--but public moneys could not be advanced for\r\nan engine that did not exist, so the other pioneers, who had followed\r\nFerber in gliding experiments, preceded him in flying. In 1906 Ferber\r\nobtained Government permission to join the Antoinette firm for a period,\r\nand by 1908 he was flying in an aeroplane of his own design. He was\r\nkilled in September 1909, on the aerodrome of Beuvrequen, near Boulogne,\r\nby capsizing on rough ground in the act of alighting. His own estimate\r\nof his work was modest; he had acted, he said, as a ferment and a\r\npopularizer, and had helped to put France on the right track; but it was\r\nhis pride that he belonged to the great school, the school of\r\nLilienthal, Pilcher, Chanute, and the Wrights, who went to work by a\r\nprogressive method of practical experiment, who combined daring with\r\npatience, and found their way into the air.\r\n\r\nFerber, after his visit to America, had failed to induce the French\r\nauthorities to purchase the Wright aeroplane, which he had never seen,\r\nbut which, from descriptions and photographs, he was able to\r\nreconstruct, much as a geologist reconstructs an animal from fossil\r\nbones. The refusal of the French Government to purchase and the\r\nwithdrawal of the Wrights from their public experiments gave France a\r\nperiod of respite for two years, during which time French aviation\r\nrapidly developed on lines of its own. At the back of this movement was\r\nM. Archdeacon, who as early as 1903 had established a fund and had\r\noffered a cup as a prize for the first officially recorded flight of\r\nmore than twenty-five metres. The Voisin brothers, Gabriel and Charles,\r\nhaving set up their factory at Billancourt-sur-Seine, built machines for\r\nhim, box-kites and aeroplanes. After a time the Voisin brothers went\r\ninto business on their own account, and employed M. Colliex as their\r\nengineer. Their earliest customers, Leon Delagrange, who had been\r\ntrained as a sculptor, and Henri Farman, who had combined the\r\nprofessions of cyclist, painter, and motor-racer, were distinguished\r\nearly French flyers. That both these men had been artists seems to bear\r\nout the favourite contention of Wilbur Wright and of Captain Ferber. To\r\nbe an artist a man must create or initiate; the accumulation of\r\nknowledge will do little for him. A politician or a lawyer can reach to\r\nhigh distinction in his profession without the power of initiating\r\nanything. It is enough for him to handle other men's ideas, to combine\r\nthem and balance them, to study and conciliate other men, and to suggest\r\na compromise. But the artist, like the scientific discoverer, must act\r\non his own ideas, and do battle, single-handed, with the nature of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThe earliest experiments of M. Archdeacon and the Voisins were made with\r\nman-carrying Hargrave box-kites, or with gliders made on the same\r\nprinciple, which were towed in the air behind a fast motor-boat\r\ntravelling down the Seine. The next step was to fit an aeroplane with an\r\nengine and wheels so that it might attempt to rise from the ground. The\r\nVoisins collaborated with most of the early French aviators, with Louis\r\nBleriot and Robert Esnault-Pelterie, as well as with Farman and\r\nDelagrange. At one time they were closely associated with Bleriot, at\r\nanother time with Farman. Their first machines depended for lateral\r\nstability on the vertical panels of the box-kite structure. This was\r\ninsufficient, and the French designers had to grapple, one by one, with\r\nall the difficulties that had been met and conquered by the Wrights.\r\nThey had this advantage, that the design of the Wrights' machine was,\r\nthough not exactly, yet in its main features known to them. All the\r\nearly aeroplanes which mounted their elevators in front of the machine\r\nmay, without much doubt, be affiliated to the Wrights. The elevator is\r\nnot best placed in front; its action in that position is too quick and\r\nviolent, but it is under the eye of the operator, and with cool nerves\r\nhe can learn to work it.\r\n\r\nWhile the group of enthusiasts who gathered round the Voisins were\r\ndesigning and experimenting, Santos Dumont, having turned his attention\r\nto machines heavier than air, suddenly appeared among them, made the\r\nfirst successful flight over French soil, and carried off the Archdeacon\r\nprize. His machine was a biplane, built on the box-kite principle, with\r\nthree vertical panels on each side between the planes, and a box-kite\r\nelevator projecting far in front. The wings were fixed at a considerable\r\ndihedral angle, and the engine was a twenty-four horse-power Antoinette.\r\nIn his first trial, which took place at Bagatelle on the 23rd of July\r\n1906, Santos Dumont attached a spindle-shaped balloon to the upper\r\nsurface of the machine, to help it into the air. The combination of the\r\ntwo modes he soon found to be impossible; with the balloon attached to\r\nit the machine could not develop speed enough to support itself in the\r\nair. His next step was to practise the machine by running it down an\r\ninclined cable; then he discarded as much weight as he could, doubled\r\nthe horse-power of the motor, and began to taxi freely along the ground.\r\nOn a day in September the machine raised itself for a very short space\r\ninto the air. The first officially witnessed flight, of about eighty\r\nyards, took place on the 23rd of October 1906, and gained the Archdeacon\r\nCup. About a month later he made a flight of more than a furlong.\r\nThereafter he established himself at Saint-Cyr and developed a machine\r\nof the monoplane type, with a long tail. But he was too far from the\r\nresources of Paris, and when, on the 13th of January 1908, Henri Farman\r\novertook his records and won the Deutsch-Archdeacon prize for a flight\r\nof one kilometre in a closed circuit, Santos Dumont lost his leading\r\nposition in the world of aviation, after a brief and meteoric career\r\nwhich has stamped his name on history.\r\n\r\nDuring these early years the Voisin brothers had the foresight and\r\nwisdom to put themselves wholly at the service of others. The promise of\r\nflight had taken hold of many minds in France and there was no lack of\r\ninventors and would-be inventors who wished to test their own ideas and\r\nto have machines built to their own designs. If the Voisins had refused\r\nto gratify them, these clients would have disappeared; and the work done\r\nfor them, though much of it was done in the old blind alleys of\r\nhorizontal elevating airscrews and wing-flapping machines, yet had this\r\nadvantage, that it kept the workshop active and made it self-supporting.\r\nInventors are a difficult and jealous people; they received every\r\nindulgence from the Voisins. The machines built for them were named\r\nafter them, though most of the skill and experience that went to the\r\nmaking came from the factory. In the same way M. Archdeacon gave up all\r\npractical experiment after 1905 and was content to play the part of the\r\ngood genius of aviation, presiding at the Aero Club, offering prizes for\r\nnew achievements, bringing inventors together and encouraging the\r\nexchange of ideas. The rapidity of French progress was not a little due\r\nto this self-effacing and social instinct, so characteristic of the\r\nFrench spirit, which kept the patron and the engineers in the\r\nbackground, and brought order and progress out of the chaos of personal\r\nrivalry.\r\n\r\nProgress was slow at first. The experiments made in 1906 by Bleriot in\r\nconjunction with the Voisins were made, for safety, on the water of the\r\nLake of Enghien, but it proved impossible to get up sufficient speed on\r\nthe water to rise into the air. In 1907 a greater success attended the\r\nexperiments made at Vincennes, at Bagatelle, and at Issy-les-Moulineaux,\r\nwhere Henri Farman had obtained permission to use the army manoeuvre\r\nground and had built himself a hangar, or shed, for his aeroplane. On\r\nthe 30th of March, at Bagatelle, the Delagrange aeroplane made a flight\r\nof sixty metres. A few months later, Farman, on a similar machine fitted\r\nwith landing-wheels which worked on pivots, like castors, began to make\r\nshort flights. On the 30th of September he flew for eighty metres.\r\nSeeing is believing, but many of those who saw Farman fly did not\r\nbelieve. The machine, they said, was only hopping into the air with the\r\nspeed it had gathered on the ground; it would never fly. When, on the\r\n26th of October, Farman made a flight of more than seven hundred metres\r\nthe pessimists found another objection. The machine, they said, would\r\nnever be able to turn; it could only continue in a straight line. They\r\nhad hit on a real difficulty, but the Voisins and Farman himself, who,\r\nstarting without any knowledge of aeroplanes or flying, had soon\r\ndeveloped practical ideas of his own, were hard at work to meet it. The\r\nWrights had simplified the handling of a machine by combining the\r\ncontrol of the vertical rudder with the control of the wing-warping. In\r\nthe early Voisin machines there was no wing-warping, and the pilots had\r\nto attempt to balance and turn the machine without it; but a rod with a\r\nwheel attached to it was used to control both the elevating plane in\r\nfront and the vertical rudder behind. By turning the wheel the rudder\r\nwas operated, by moving the rod the elevator was raised or lowered. It\r\nwas on a machine of this kind that Farman began to practise gradual\r\nturning movements. The lateral inclination of the machine was feared\r\nand, as much as possible, avoided in these first experiments, though it\r\nis not only harmless in turning movements, but is necessary for their\r\ncomplete success, just as the banking of a motor race-track is necessary\r\nto keep the machines on the course. Farman made rapid progress; and, as\r\nhas been said, by the beginning of 1908 he gained the two thousand pound\r\nDeutsch-Archdeacon prize for a closed circuit of one kilometre in\r\nlength. The wonderful skill of this achievement will be fully\r\nappreciated only by the best modern pilots, who would not like to be\r\nasked to repeat it on a machine unprovided with ailerons (that is to\r\nsay, hinged flaps on the trailing edge of the planes), and controlled\r\nonly by the elevator and the rudder. There is nothing very extravagant\r\nin dating the conquest of the air, as some French writers have dated it,\r\nfrom the circular flights of Farman. It is true that the Wrights had\r\nattained a much higher skill in manoeuvring, but they had retired, like\r\nAchilles, to their tent, whereas Farman's flight showed the way to many\r\nothers. In the spring of the same year Delagrange began to execute\r\nturning flights; on the 6th of July Farman gained the prize offered by\r\nM. Armengaud, the president of the society of aerial navigation, for a\r\nflight of a quarter of an hour's duration, and after the arrival of\r\nWilbur Wright at Le Mans progress became so rapid that records were\r\nbroken week by week and almost day by day. In January 1909 the Aero Club\r\nof France issued their first list of pilots' certificates. Eight names,\r\nall famous, made up the list--Leon Delagrange, Alberto Santos Dumont,\r\nRobert Esnault-Pelterie, Henri Farman, Wilbur Wright, Orville Wright,\r\nCaptain Ferdinand Ferber, Louis Bleriot. To make this a list of the\r\nchief French pioneers, the names of the Wrights would have to be\r\nomitted, and the names of some who were not famous pilots but who did\r\nmuch for flying, especially the names of M. Ernest Archdeacon and\r\nGabriel Voisin, would have to be included.\r\n\r\nThese men, and those who worked for them, gave to France her own school\r\nof aviation. Louis Bleriot and Robert Esnault-Pelterie broke away from\r\nwhat, since the days of Francis Wenham, had been accepted as the\r\northodox doctrine of the biplane, and, taking the bird for master,\r\ndevised swift, light, and easily handled monoplanes. The Bleriot\r\nmonoplane, which first flew the Channel; the R.E.P. (or Robert\r\nEsnault-Pelterie) monoplane; the Antoinette monoplane, on which Hubert\r\nLatham performed his exploits; the small and swift Demoiselle monoplane,\r\ndesigned and flown by Santos Dumont; and the Tellier monoplane, which\r\nfor a time held the record for cross-country flight--all these made\r\nhistory by their performances in the crowded years from 1908 to 1910.\r\nThe monoplane is, without any doubt, the prettiest of machines in the\r\nair. When Captain Ferber gave this reason to Mr. Chanute for preferring\r\nit to the biplane, Mr. Chanute, he says, laughed a good deal at an\r\nargument so characteristically French. But there is sense and weight in\r\nthe argument. No flying animal is half so ugly as the early Wright\r\nbiplane. In the world of natural fliers beauty and efficiency are one.\r\nPurity of line and economy of parts are beautiful and efficient. A good\r\nillustration of this may be found in the question of the airscrew. The\r\nearly French biplanes of the Voisin and Farman type were what would now\r\nbe called 'pusher' machines; their airscrews operated behind the main\r\nplanes, and their tails were supported by an open structure of wood or\r\nmetal which left room for the play of the screw. In this ugly\r\narrangement the loss of efficiency is easy to see. The screw works in a\r\ndisturbed medium, and the complicated metal-work presents a large\r\nresistance to the passage of the machine through the air. The monoplane,\r\nfrom the first, was a 'tractor' machine; its airscrew was in front of\r\nthe planes, and its body, or fuselage, was covered in and streamlined,\r\nso as to offer the least possible resistance to the air. A later\r\ndifficulty caused by the forward position of the airscrew had nothing to\r\ndo with flying. When the war came, and machine-guns were mounted on\r\naeroplanes, a clear field was needed for forward firing. This difficulty\r\nwas ultimately met by the invention of a synchronizing gear, which timed\r\nthe bullets between the strokes of the airscrew-blades. In all but a few\r\ntypes of machine the airscrew is now retained in the forward position.\r\nThe debate between monoplane and biplane is not yet concluded; the\r\nbiplane holds its own because with the same area of supporting surface\r\nit is much stronger and more compact than the monoplane.\r\n\r\nInstead of wing-warping, which puts a strain on the supporting surfaces\r\nand is liable to distort them, the French (to whom Bleriot is believed\r\nto have shown the way) introduced ailerons, that is, small subsidiary\r\nhinged planes attached to the extremities of the wings. By controlling\r\nthese, one up and the other down, in conjunction with the rudder, the\r\npilot can preserve his lateral balance, and turn the machine to right or\r\nleft. Later on, these ailerons, when they were borrowed by the Voisin\r\nand Farman biplanes, were not fitted to the extremities of the planes,\r\nbut became hinged flaps forming the extreme section of the trailing\r\nedge; and this position they have kept in all modern aeroplanes. An even\r\ngreater advance was made by the French school in its device for the\r\ncontrol of the machine. The machine which Wilbur Wright flew in France\r\nwas controlled by two upright levers, grasped by the pilot, one in\r\neither hand. The left-hand lever moved only backwards and forwards; it\r\ncontrolled the elevator and directed the machine upwards or downwards.\r\nThe right-hand lever controlled the rudder and the warping of the wings.\r\nBy moving it backwards or forwards the pilot turned the machine to right\r\nor left; by moving it sideways he warped the wings. There is nothing\r\ninstinctive or natural in these correspondences; the backward and\r\nforward movement which in one lever spells up and down in the other\r\nspells right and left. It is a testimony to the extraordinary\r\ncool-headed skill of the Wrights, and to their endless practice and\r\nperseverance, that they were able to fly such a machine in safety, and\r\nto outfly their rivals. The French school centralized the control in a\r\nsingle lever with a universal joint attachment at the lower end. The\r\nmovements of this lever in any direction produced the effects that would\r\ninstinctively be expected; a backward or forward movement turned the\r\nmachine upwards or downwards, a sideways movement raised one wing or the\r\nother so as to bank the machine or to bring it to a level position\r\nagain. The vertical rudder was controlled either by a wheel attached to\r\nthis central lever, or by the pressure of the pilot's feet on a\r\nhorizontal bar. The French moreover improved the means of taking off and\r\nalighting. The early Wright machines were launched on rails, and\r\nalighted on skids attached to the machine like the skids of a sledge. To\r\nrise into the air again after a forced landing was impossible without\r\nspecial apparatus. By means of wheels elastically fixed to an\r\nundercarriage the French inventors made the aeroplane available for\r\ncross-country journeys. But the greatest difference between the two\r\ntypes of aeroplane, the American and the French, was their difference in\r\nstability. The Wright machine demanded everything of the pilot; it could\r\nnot fly itself. If the pilot relaxed his attention for a moment, or took\r\nhis hands from the levers, a crash was the certain result. The machine\r\nwas a bird which flew with extended bill and without a tail; whereas the\r\nFrench machines had a horizontal tail-plane, which, being held rigidly\r\nat a distance from the main planes, gave to the machine a far greater\r\nmeasure of longitudinal stability.\r\n\r\nAll these advantages told in favour of French aviation, and secured for\r\nit progress and achievement.\r\n\r\nA few dates and facts may serve to show its rapid progress at a time\r\nwhen it was making history week by week. On the 30th of September 1908\r\nHenri Farman made the first cross-country flight, from Chalons to\r\nRheims, a distance of twenty-seven kilometres, which he covered in\r\ntwenty minutes. Three days later, at Chalons, he remained in the air for\r\njust under three-quarters of an hour, covering twenty-five miles, that\r\nis, about forty times the distance that had won him the\r\nDeutsch-Archdeacon prize in January. Between April and September of the\r\nsame year Leon Delagrange had four times in succession raised the\r\nworld's official records (which, of course, took no note of the Wrights)\r\nfor duration of flight. On the 31st of October Louis Bleriot made the\r\nfirst cross-country circuit flight, from Toury to Artenay and back, a\r\ndistance of about seventeen miles, in the course of which flight he\r\ntwice landed and rose again into the air. All these and many similar\r\nachievements were dwarfed by Wilbur Wright's performance at the\r\nHunaudieres racecourse near Le Mans. His first flight, on Saturday the\r\n8th of August, lasted one minute and forty-seven seconds. Three days\r\nlater, though he flew for only four minutes, the figures of eight and\r\nother manoeuvres which he executed in the air caused M. Delagrange, who\r\nwitnessed them, to remark, 'Eh bien. Nous n'existons pas. Nous sommes\r\nbattus.' On the last day of the year he flew for two hours and twenty\r\nminutes, covering seventy-seven miles. In the intervening time he had\r\nbeaten the French records for duration, distance, and height.\r\nCross-country work he did not attempt; his machine at that time was\r\nill-fitted for it. During the winter he went to Pau to instruct his\r\nfirst three pupils--the Count de Lambert and MM. Paul Tissandier and\r\nAlfred Leblanc.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1909 the mystery and craft of flying was\r\nstill known only to the few. In the two years that followed it was\r\ndivulged to the many, and became a public spectacle. The age of the\r\ndesigners was followed by the age of the performers. Flying machines and\r\nmen who could fly them rapidly increased in number. A man working in a\r\nlaboratory on difficult and uncertain experiments cannot engage or\r\nretain the attention of the public; a flying man, who circles over a\r\ncity or flies across great tracts of populated country, is visible to\r\nall, and, when he is first seen, excites a frenzy of popular enthusiasm.\r\nThese years were the years of competition and adventure, of races, and\r\nof record-breaking in distance, speed, duration, and height. Flying was\r\nthe newest sport; and the aviator, whose courage, coolness, and skill\r\ncarried him through great dangers, was the hero of the day. The press,\r\nwith its ready instinct for profitable publicity, offered magnificent\r\nencouragement to the new art. Large money prizes were won by gallant\r\ndeeds that have made history. The _Daily Mail_, of London, offered a\r\nprize of a thousand pounds for the first flight across the English\r\nChannel. Hubert Latham, in his Antoinette monoplane, attempted this\r\nflight on the 19th of July from the neighbourhood of Calais, but the\r\nfailure of his sparking plugs brought him down on to the water about six\r\nmiles from the French coast, where he was picked up by his accompanying\r\ndestroyer. He was preparing another attempt when Louis Bleriot, suddenly\r\narriving at Calais, anticipated him. At half-past four on the morning of\r\nSunday, the 25th of July, Bleriot rose into the air on his monoplane,\r\nfurnished with an Anzani engine of twenty-five horse-power, and headed\r\nfor Dover. He flew without map or compass, and soon out-distanced the\r\nFrench destroyer which had been appointed to escort him. For ten minutes\r\nhe lost sight of all land, but he corrected his course by observing the\r\nsteamers below him, and landed in the Northfall meadow behind Dover\r\nCastle after a flight of forty minutes. Two other newspaper prizes, one\r\nof ten thousand pounds offered by the London _Daily Mail_ for a flight\r\nfrom London to Manchester, in three stages, the other of ten thousand\r\ndollars offered by the New York _World_ for a flight from Albany to New\r\nYork, were won in 1910. The first of these flights was attempted on the\r\n24th of April by an Englishman, Claude Grahame-White, who flew a Farman\r\nbiplane, but was compelled by engine trouble to descend near Lichfield,\r\nwhere his machine was damaged by wind in the night. Three days later\r\nLouis Paulhan, also mounted on a Farman biplane, covered the whole\r\ndistance to Manchester in something over four hours, with only one\r\nlanding. Paulhan had first learned to fly in July 1909; Grahame-White\r\nhad obtained his pilot's certificate from the French Aero Club as late\r\nas December 1909. The flight of a hundred and twenty miles from Albany\r\nto New York, down the Hudson river, was achieved on the 29th of May in\r\ntwo hours and thirty-two minutes by Glenn H. Curtiss, one of the most\r\ndistinguished of American pioneers. Later on in 1910 a prize of a\r\nhundred thousand francs was offered by the Paris newspaper, the _Matin_,\r\nfor what was called the _Circuit de l'Est_, a voyage from Paris and back\r\nby way of Troyes, Nancy, Mezieres, Douai, and Amiens, a distance of four\r\nhundred and eighty-eight miles, to be completed in six stages, on\r\nalternate days, from the 7th of August to the 17th of August. This\r\ncompetition was won by Wilbur Wright's pupil, Alfred Leblanc, on a\r\nBleriot monoplane. The eastern part of this circuit, a territory not\r\nmuch larger than Yorkshire, has since been made famous and sacred by the\r\nbattles of the Marne and Verdun and a hundred other places.\r\n\r\nOf more value for the furtherance of the art than any of these\r\nindividual exploits were the series of meetings which brought aviators\r\ntogether in friendly rivalry, to see and to be seen. The most notable\r\nof these meetings was also the first, the Champagne Week of Rheims,\r\nwhich was organized by the Marquis de Polignac, and was held, during the\r\nlast week of August 1909, on the Betheny Plain, near Rheims. The number\r\nof spectators day by day was from forty to fifty thousand, and the\r\ngate-money taken during the week was about L35,000. Henri Farman, Hubert\r\nLatham, and Glenn Curtiss earned among them almost L6,000 in prizes. The\r\nGrand Prix de la Champagne for the flight of longest duration was won by\r\nFarman, who remained in the air, plodding steadily round the course, for\r\nmore than three hours. He also won the passenger-carrying prize in a\r\nflight which carried two passengers round the ten-kilometre course in\r\nabout ten minutes and a half. Latham gained the altitude prize by flying\r\nto a height of more than five hundred feet. The Gordon Bennett Cup, for\r\nthe best speed over two rounds of the course, was won by Curtiss in\r\nfifteen minutes fifty and three-fifths seconds, with Bleriot only some\r\nfive seconds behind him. There were many other prizes distributed among\r\nthe more fortunate of the competitors. Perhaps the greatest gain of the\r\nmeeting was that it did away with the notion that the aeroplane is a\r\nfair-weather toy. There was rain and storm, and Paulhan flew in a wind\r\nof twenty-five miles an hour. The meeting witnessed the first public\r\nsuccess of the most famous (and most revolutionary) of aeroplane\r\nengines--the rotary Gnome engine, in which the cylinders rotate bodily\r\nround a fixed crank-shaft. This engine was built by the brothers Louis\r\nand Laurent Seguin, who had a small motor factory in Paris. Most of the\r\nregular aviators looked askance at it, but Seguin offered to instal it\r\nin a Voisin biplane of the box-kite pattern which had just been won as a\r\nprize by Louis Paulhan. In the result the old box-kite flew as never\r\nbox-kite flew before, and produced a great impression at the Rheims\r\nmeeting. The Gnome engine was also mounted by Henri Farman on one of the\r\nmachines that he flew at Rheims, and by the solitary English competitor,\r\nMr. G. B. Cockburn, who, according to Mr. Holt Thomas, was the first to\r\nuse this engine in the air.\r\n\r\nOther meetings followed in rapid succession, gaining recruits for the\r\nnew art and converting the nations to a belief in it. Two of these, held\r\nsimultaneously at Blackpool and Doncaster, soon after the Rheims\r\nmeeting, were spoilt by bad weather and high winds, but at Blackpool\r\nHubert Latham gave a marvellous display on his Antoinette machine by\r\nflying in a wind of about forty miles an hour, when no one else ventured\r\nthe attempt. During 1910 aviation weeks were held in February at\r\nHeliopolis, Egypt, and in April at Nice. In October of the same year an\r\nInternational Aviation Tournament was held in America at Belmont Park,\r\nLong Island, where the highest honour, the prize for the Gordon Bennett\r\nspeed contest, was won by Claude Grahame-White on a Bleriot machine. In\r\nGreat Britain many meetings were held during the summer of 1910: one at\r\nWolverhampton; another at Bournemouth, where the Hon. C. S. Rolls, who a\r\nmonth before had flown across the Channel and back without alighting,\r\nwas killed; another at Lanark; and yet another at Blackpool, where\r\nGeorge Chavez flew to a height of 5,887 feet. In the following month\r\nChavez flew across the Alps, over the Simplon Pass, into Italy, but was\r\nfatally injured in alighting at Domodossola. These are specimen deeds\r\nonly, taken from a story of adventure and progress, danger and disaster,\r\nwhich, if it were fully told, would fill volumes. Records, as they are\r\ncalled, were made and broken so fast that the heroic achievement of the\r\nspring became the daily average performance of the ensuing autumn. The\r\nmovement was fairly under way, and nothing could stop it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFLIGHT IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all these doings England bore but a small part. English aviators were\r\nfew; and those who distinguished themselves in public competition had\r\nlearned their flying in France. To speak of England's share in these\r\namazing years of progress is to tell the history of a backward parish,\r\nand to describe its small contribution to a great world-wide movement.\r\nYet the story, for that very reason, has an extraordinary interest.\r\nEngland never has been cosmopolitan. All her beginnings, even where she\r\nhas led the way and set the fashion to the world, were parochial. If a\r\nchange is in question, England makes trial of it, late and reluctantly,\r\non a small scale, in her own garden. All the noisy exhortations of a\r\nthousand newspapers cannot touch her apprehension or rouse her to\r\nexcitement. Next year's fashions do not much preoccupy her mind; she\r\nknows that they will come to her, in due time, from France, to be taken\r\nor rejected. When a change is something more than a fashion, and vital\r\nconditions begin to be affected, her lethargy is broken in a moment and\r\nshe is awake and alert. So it was with the fashion of air-travel. The\r\nfirst aviator's certificate granted by a British authority was issued by\r\nthe Royal Aero Club of the United Kingdom to Mr. J. T. C. Moore-Brabazon\r\nin March 1910, when already the exploits of flying men were the theme of\r\nall the world. By the 1st of November in the same year the Royal Aero\r\nClub had issued twenty-two certificates; that is to say, twenty-two\r\npilots, some of them self-taught, and some trained in France, were\r\nlicensed by the sole British authority as competent to handle a machine\r\nin the air. Eight years later, in November 1918, when the armistice put\r\nan end to the active operations of the war, the Royal Air Force was the\r\nlargest and strongest of the air forces of the world. We were late in\r\nbeginning, but once we had begun we were not slow. We were rich in\r\nengineering skill and in material for the struggle. Best of all, we had\r\na body of youth fitted by temperament for the work of the air, and\r\neducated, as if by design, to take risks with a light heart--the boys of\r\nthe Public Schools of England. As soon as the opportunity came they\r\noffered themselves in thousands for a work which can never be done well\r\nwhen it is done without zest, and which calls for some of the highest\r\nqualities of character--fearlessness, self-dependence, and swift\r\ndecision. The Germans, before the war, used to speak with some contempt,\r\nperhaps with more than they felt, of the English love of sport, which\r\nthey liked to think was frivolous and unworthy of a serious nation.\r\nTheir forethought and organization, which was intensely, almost\r\nmaniacally, serious, was defeated by what they despised; and the love of\r\nsport, or, to give it its noblest name, the chivalry, of their enemies,\r\nwhich they treated as a foolish relic of romance, proved itself to be\r\nthe most practical thing in the world.\r\n\r\nThe English pioneers of flight, who had learned their flying abroad,\r\nbrought back their knowledge, and did what they could to arouse their\r\ncountry to effort. What their success would have been if the peace of\r\nEurope had continued unbroken and unthreatened it is impossible to say,\r\nbut progress would probably have been slow--an affair of sporadic\r\nattempts and scattered adventures. The two strongest motives, patriotic\r\ndevotion and commercial gain, would have been lacking. The English have\r\nnever been good at preparing for a merely possible war; they are apt,\r\nindeed, to regard such preparation as ill-omened and impious. This\r\nstrenuous and self-dependent breed of men, being conscious that they do\r\nnot desire war, and believing that he is thrice armed who has his\r\nquarrel just, have always been content, in the face of many warnings, to\r\nrepose their main confidence in the virtue of their cause and the\r\nstrength of their character. The risks that they run through this\r\nconfidence have often been pointed out, but it should also be remembered\r\nthat by their reluctance to act on theory they have often been saved\r\nfrom the elaborate futility and expense of acting on a false theory. The\r\ndisaster which has befallen Germany cannot but strengthen them in their\r\nbelief that it is dangerous to devote care and thought to preparing for\r\nall imaginable conflicts. So also in the activities of civil life,\r\nbefore they undertake a large outlay they ask to be assured of solid\r\ngains. They leave it to the adventurers, who have never failed them, to\r\nblaze the track for commerce. Where a new science is concerned, this\r\nmode of progress is slow. Private enterprise and personal rivalry too\r\noften bring with them the tactics of secrecy. Science is not an\r\nindividual possession, and the man who tries to appropriate it to\r\nhimself often sterilizes his work and forfeits his place in the history\r\nof progress. In his anxiety to assert his own claims he forgets that his\r\nwork has been made possible only by what has come to him as a free gift\r\nfrom others, that his own contribution to human knowledge is a slight\r\nthing, that in protecting himself against imitators he is also depriving\r\nhimself of helpers and pupils, and is bartering the dignity of science\r\nfor the rewards of a patentee. The Wrights in America and Captain Ferber\r\nin France left behind them a full and frank record of all their doings,\r\nthereby conferring an enormous benefit on others, and securing for\r\nthemselves an unassailable position in the history of flight. Much may\r\nbe said in favour of the traditional English doctrine of free\r\ncompetition. Where knowledge is readily accessible, and the field is\r\nopen to all, free competition stimulates and rewards industry and skill.\r\nOn the other hand, where a new science is struggling into being,\r\ncommercial competition often retards it by a network of restrictions and\r\nconcealments, and converts knowledge, which ought to be a public trust,\r\nto the darker purposes of private gain. The coming of the war burst\r\nthese bonds, and immensely quickened the progress of the science of\r\nflight. Inventors, who are usually poor men, so soon as their country\r\ncalled on them, put themselves at her disposal, and found their chief\r\nreward in helping to save her at her need.\r\n\r\nThe course of events during the early years of the twentieth century\r\nleft England no time for developing the art of flight in her own\r\ntentative and permissive fashion. The coming of the new art coincided\r\nwith the rapid gathering of the storm-cloud that was to burst in the\r\nGreat War. In 1903 the Wrights first flew in a power-driven machine. In\r\n1909 the achievements of the Rheims meeting marked the end of the\r\ninfancy of the art. In 1912 the Royal Flying Corps was formed. During\r\nthis same period of ten years armaments were being piled up by all the\r\ngreater European countries, international tension was increasing, and\r\nominous events, small in themselves, but impressive by the gravity and\r\nsolemnity with which they were regarded by the chancelleries of Europe,\r\nrecurred in a series of growing intensity and significance. Germany was\r\nnot threatened in any part of the world, but Germany was known to\r\nbelieve in war, and many responsible observers were uneasily and\r\nreluctantly forced to the conviction that Germany intended war, and\r\nwould make war for unlimited purposes on any small occasion created or\r\nchosen by herself. The Royal Flying Corps was formed not for far-sighted\r\nulterior ends, as an instrument of progress and research, but for a very\r\npresent need, as a weapon to be placed in the hands of the country on\r\nthe day when battle should be joined. Two years before the corps was\r\nformed the aeronautical force at the disposal of the nation was centred\r\nin the balloon factory and balloon school at Aldershot. The naval and\r\nmilitary officers who had interested themselves in aeronautics were few,\r\nbut they were competent and enthusiastic; they believed in the air, and\r\nwere quick to recognize inventions of promise. The consequence of this\r\nwas that the aeroplane and the airship in England, from the very first,\r\ngrew up more or less tended by the Government, and received as much\r\nencouragement as could possibly be given under the severe restrictions\r\nof parliamentary finance. Almost every airship that was built was built\r\nby the Government. Almost every pioneer of flight in England sooner or\r\nlater came into touch with the Government, and did work for the nation.\r\nAs early as 1904 Mr. S. F. Cody, who had been connected in early life\r\nwith the theatrical profession in America, and had made many experiments\r\nin aeronautics, was supplying kites to the balloon factory. In 1906 he\r\nwas appointed chief instructor in kiting, and in 1908 he built for\r\nhimself an aeroplane, similar in type to the machine of Mr. Glenn H.\r\nCurtiss, and made many experimental flights over Laffan's Plain. He was\r\na picturesque and hardy individualist of the old school; though he had\r\nhad no technical training as an engineer, his wide practical knowledge,\r\nhis courage, and his exuberant vitality made him a man of mark, and\r\nengaged the admiration of the public. Most of his work was official; he\r\nwas killed by the breaking of his machine in the air while flying over\r\nLaffan's Plain, in August 1913. Another early inventor, Lieutenant J. W.\r\nDunne, joined the balloon factory in 1906, and at once began to carry\r\nout systematic trials with gliders. Encouraged by Colonel J. E. Capper,\r\nwho was in charge of the factory, and assisted by Sir Hiram Maxim, he\r\ndevised a biplane glider with a box-kite tail, which when it was\r\nsuspended from a kind of revolving gallows at the Crystal Palace\r\nattained a speed in the air of seventy miles an hour and rose to a\r\nheight of seventy feet. Later on the experiments were transferred to\r\nBlair Atholl in Perthshire, where the power-driven Dunne aeroplane was\r\nproduced and flown. It had backward sloping wings which performed the\r\nfunction of a stabilizing tail. Most aeroplanes are modelled more or\r\nless closely on flying animals; the Dunne aeroplane took hints from the\r\nzannonia leaf, which, being weighted in front by the seed-pod, and\r\ncurved back on either side, becomes, as the tips of the leaf wither and\r\ncurl, a perfectly stable aerofoil for conveying the seed to a distance.\r\nThe gliding powers of the zannonia leaf were first noticed by Ahlborn of\r\nBerlin, and several foreign aeroplanes were modelled on it. The\r\nstability of the Dunne machine was surprising, and it performed many\r\ngood flights before the war, but it sacrificed speed and lifting power\r\nto stability, so that its history in the war is a blank. Stability\r\nspells safety, and safety is not the first condition insisted on by war.\r\nAn obstinately stable machine is good for trudging along in the air, but\r\nit is not easy to manoeuvre in face of the enemy. The Dunne machine\r\nadjusted itself more readily to the gusts and currents of the air than\r\nto the demands of the pilot. Skilled war-pilots prefer to handle a\r\nmachine which is as quick as a squirrel and responds at once to the\r\npressure of a finger on the control. If the aeroplane had been developed\r\nwholly in peace, some of the stable machines of the early inventors\r\nwould have come into their own, and would have had a numerous following.\r\n\r\nThe first flight ever made over English soil was made by Mr. A. V. Roe,\r\nin a machine of his own construction. Mr. Roe began life as an\r\napprentice at the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Locomotive Works,\r\nand very early distinguished himself in cycle racing. He then qualified\r\nas a fitter at Portsmouth Dockyard, studied naval engineering at King's\r\nCollege, London, and spent three years, from 1899 to 1902, in the\r\nmerchant service as a marine engineer. The seagulls and the albatross of\r\nthe southern seas set him thinking, and he began to make model gliders.\r\nReturned home again, he spent some time as a draughtsman in the motor\r\nindustry. The news of the Wrights' achievements found in him a ready\r\nbeliever, and he wrote to _The Times_ to combat the prevailing\r\nscepticism. His letter was printed, with a foot-note by the engineering\r\neditor to the effect that all attempts at artificial flight on such a\r\nbasis as Mr. Roe described were not only dangerous to human life, but\r\nwere foredoomed to failure from the engineering standpoint. From 1906\r\nonwards Mr. Roe devoted all his time and all his savings to aviation. In\r\n1907 he made a full-size flying machine and took it to the Brooklands\r\nmotor track. He had no sufficient engine power, and while he was waiting\r\nmany months for the arrival of a twenty-four horse-power Antoinette\r\nengine from France he induced sympathetic motorists to give him\r\nexperimental towing flights. It was difficult, he says, to induce the\r\nmotorists to let go at once when the machine began to swerve in the air;\r\nthey often held on with inconvenient fidelity, and many of the\r\nexperiments ended in a dive and a crash. In the spring of 1908 his\r\nAntoinette engine arrived, and on the 8th of June he made the first\r\nflight ever made in England, covering some sixty yards at a height of\r\ntwo feet from the ground. Then he received notice to quit Brooklands. He\r\nhad never been much favoured by the management, who perhaps thought that\r\nthe wreckage of aeroplanes would not add to the popularity of a\r\nmotor-racing track, and his experiments had been made under very\r\ndifficult conditions, for he was not allowed to sleep in the shed where\r\nhis machine was housed, nor to practise with the machine during the\r\nhours when the track was in use. He applied to the War Office for leave\r\nto erect his shed by the side of Mr. Cody's at Laffan's Plain, but was\r\nrefused. He then consulted a map of London, and pitched upon Lea\r\nMarshes, where there were some large fields open to the public, and some\r\nrailway arches, a couple of which he rented and boarded up. In the\r\nstable of a house at Putney belonging to one of his brothers he had\r\nalready built a tractor triplane which he now removed to Lea Marshes.\r\nUnder the stress of his misfortunes he had parted with his Antoinette\r\nengine, so he had nothing better for his triplane than a nine\r\nhorse-power J.A.P. motor-cycle engine designed by John Alfred Prestwich.\r\nWith this, the lowest-powered engine that has ever flown in England, he\r\nmade, in June 1909, the first successful flight on an all-British\r\naeroplane. Thereafter he made many flights; the earliest of these were\r\nshort and low, earning him the name of 'Roe the Hopper', but before long\r\nhe was making flights of three hundred yards in length at a height of\r\nfrom six to ten feet. One day in the summer of 1909 a young woman who\r\nhad come down to commit suicide in the river Lea saw his machine\r\nskimming about and went home; then she wrote to Mr. Roe urging him to\r\nlet her take his place as pilot and so save his life at the expense of\r\nhers. Mr. Roe very tactfully replied that he would gladly let her fly\r\nthe machine when he had perfected it, thus offering her something to\r\nlook forward to. But his chief troubles were with the local authorities,\r\nwho employed a bailiff to watch him and prevent his flying. At\r\nBrooklands Mr. Roe had become accustomed to early rising, and it was\r\nsome time before the bailiff caught him in the act of preparing to fly,\r\nbut he was caught at last, and police-court proceedings were instituted.\r\nJust at that time Bleriot flew the Channel, and the case was dropped, so\r\nthat the authorities were not called upon to decide whether flying is\r\nlegal or illegal. As for Mr. Roe, he moved on to Wembley Park, where he\r\nflew with steadily increasing success. In 1910 he made an aviation\r\npartnership with his brother, who had prospered as a manufacturer of\r\nwebbing in Manchester. In the same year he had his revenge on\r\nBrooklands, for the new manager, Major Lindsay Lloyd, saw the\r\npossibilities of aviation, and converted the centre of the track into an\r\naerodrome. There the Roes were welcomed, and there they produced and\r\nflew their thirty-five horse-power tractor triplane. After a visit to\r\nAmerica they settled down to their work and had their revenge on the War\r\nOffice by producing the famous Avro machine, so named after its\r\ninventor. In its original form it was a tractor biplane with a Gnome\r\nengine of fifty horse-power, shortly afterwards increased to eighty\r\nhorse-power. It became, and has remained, the standard training machine\r\nfor the Royal Air Force. It is sufficiently stable, and yet sensitive,\r\nand can fly safely at high or low speeds. It set the fashion to the\r\nworld in tractor biplanes. Mr. Roe had never believed in the front\r\nelevators of the early American and French aeroplanes, with the pilot\r\nsitting on the front edge of the plane, exposed to the air; nor in the\r\ntail held out by booms, as it is in the pusher machines, with the\r\nairscrews revolving between the body of the machine and the tail. For\r\nhis perfected machine of 1913 he had the advice of experts and\r\nmathematicians, but the general design of the machine was his own,\r\nworked out by pure air-sense, or, in his own words, by 'eye and\r\nexperience'. Early in 1914 the German Government bought an Avro\r\nseaplane, which soon after was the first heavier-than-air machine to\r\nmake the voyage from the mainland to Heligoland. No machine designed in\r\nthe early days of flying can compare with the Avro. As it was in 1913,\r\nso, but for improvements in detail not easy to detect, it remained\r\nthroughout the war. Its achievements in the field belong to the\r\nbeginnings of the war; it raided the airship sheds at Friedrichshafen,\r\nand, handled by Commander A. W. Bigsworth, it was the first of our\r\nmachines to attack and damage a Zeppelin in the air. For fighting\r\npurposes it has had to give way to newer types, but as a training\r\nmachine it has never been superseded, and even those aeroplanes which\r\nsurpass it in fighting quality are most of them its own children.\r\n\r\nThe early history of Mr. A. V. Roe has been here narrated, not to praise\r\nhim, though he deserves praise, nor to blame the Government, though it\r\nis always easy to blame the Government, but to show how things are done\r\nin England. His career, though distinguished, is typical; many other\r\npioneers and inventors, whose story will never be written, faced\r\ndifficulties as he did, and helped to lay the foundations of their\r\ncountry's excellence in the newly-discovered art. It has become almost\r\nusual, among those who do nothing but write, to insist that the duty of\r\nofficials, and other persons publicly appointed, is to save Englishmen\r\nthe trouble of thinking and acting for themselves. If the nation were\r\nconverted to this belief, the greatness of England would be nearing its\r\nterm. But the nation stands in the old ways, and clings to the old\r\nadventurous instincts. As it took to the sea in the sixteenth century to\r\ndefeat the Spanish tyranny, so it took to the air in the twentieth\r\ncentury to defeat the insolence of the Germans. The late Mr. Gladstone\r\nonce explained, in the freedom of social conversation, that it is the\r\nduty of a progressive party leader to test the strength of his movement\r\nby leaning back, so that he may be sure that any advance he makes is\r\nadequately supported by the pressure of the forces behind him. It is not\r\nthe most heroic view of the duties of a leader, but it has in it some of\r\nthe wisdom of an old engineer, whose business compels him to measure\r\nforces accurately. Queen Elizabeth, if she never expounded the doctrine\r\nin relation to the leadership of a nation, at least acted on it. The\r\nEnglish people have always proved themselves equal to the demand thus\r\nmade upon them; if initiative be lacking in the leaders, there is plenty\r\nof it among the rank and file. The leaders themselves, once they are\r\nbuoyed up and carried forward by the rising tide, often seize their\r\nopportunity, and surpass themselves.\r\n\r\nThe history of flight in England from 1908, when Mr. Roe and Mr. Cody\r\nfirst flew, to 1912, when flying became a part of the duty of the\r\nmilitary and naval forces of the Crown, is the history of a ferment, and\r\ncannot be exhibited in any tight or ordered sequence of cause and\r\neffect. Before the Government took in hand the building up of an air\r\nservice, there were many beginnings of private organization. A man\r\ncannot fly until he has a machine and a place for starting and\r\nalighting. These are expensive and elaborate requirements, not easily\r\nfurnished without co-operation. The Aeronautical Society did much to\r\nmake flight possible, but its labours were mainly scientific and\r\ntheoretical. In 1901 Mr. F. Hedges Butler earned his place among the\r\npioneers of the air by founding the Aero Club of the United Kingdom.\r\nThis club has played a great and honourable part in the promotion of\r\naerial navigation. When it was founded no power-driven aeroplane had as\r\nyet carried a man in the air, and the original interest of its members\r\nwas in the airship, which had been brought into high credit by M. Santos\r\nDumont; but they were quick to recognize the coming of the aeroplane,\r\nand the Hon. C. S. Rolls, who helped Mr. Butler to found the club, was\r\none of the boldest and most skilful of early pilots. The club brought\r\ntogether inventors and sportsmen, and supplied them with a suitable\r\nground for their experiments. It undertook the training of aviators, and\r\nfrom 1910 onwards, issued its certificates, which, when the Government\r\nbegan to build the Flying Corps, were officially recognized as a warrant\r\nof proficiency in the new art. An immense service was rendered in these\r\nearly years by gentlemen adventurers, engineers and pilots, who, all for\r\nlove and nothing for reward, built machines and flew them. Some of\r\nthese, when the storm broke, became the mainstay of the national force.\r\nTo take only two names out of the first hundred to whom the Aero Club\r\ngranted its certificate--a list crowded with distinction and\r\nachievement--it is not easy to assess the national debt to Mr. T. O. M.\r\nSopwith and Mr. Geoffrey de Havilland. It was in the latter part of 1911\r\nthat Mr. Sopwith, having flown with skill and distinction on the\r\nmachines which he had bought, began to build an aeroplane from his own\r\ndesigns. At that time there were no aeroplane draughtsmen, and he had to\r\nstand by and instruct his mechanics point by point. He could not afford\r\nto rent a proper workshop; the machine was built in a rough wooden shed,\r\nunsupplied with water, and lighted after dark by paraffin lamps. Six men\r\nbuilt the machine, and Mr. Sopwith flew it from the ground on which the\r\nshed stood. Its performance was better than had ever been obtained from\r\na machine of equal horse-power. It was subsequently bought by the\r\nAdmiralty, and Mr. Sopwith began to build another aeroplane of higher\r\npower, and a flying boat. In 1912 he took premises at Kingston, and\r\nthere finished these two machines. The aeroplane was successful; the\r\nflying boat was smashed during its trial flight. Another was put in\r\nhand, and was bought by the Admiralty. Aeroplane designing was in its\r\nexperimental stage, so that no large orders were obtainable, and even\r\nwhere three of a kind were ordered, numerous alterations, demanded\r\nduring the process of construction, prevented three of a kind from being\r\nbuilt. These were the beginnings of the famous Sopwith machines, and\r\nespecially of the single-seater biplane scout type, with its many\r\nvarieties. The Sopwith 'Tabloid', the Sopwith 'Pup', the Sopwith\r\n'Camel', and, last and best of all, the Sopwith 'Snipe', which was new\r\nat the front when the war ended--all these were engines of victory. So\r\nwere the equally famous machines designed for the Government by Mr. de\r\nHavilland, of which the D.H. 4 is perhaps the greatest in achievement.\r\nMr. de Havilland built his first machine early in 1910, at his own cost.\r\nOn its trial it travelled some forty yards down a slope under its own\r\npower, then it rose too steeply into the air, and when it was corrected\r\nby Mr. de Havilland, who piloted it, the strain proved too great for the\r\nstruts, which were made of American whitewood; the left main plane\r\ndoubled up, and the machine, falling heavily to the ground thirty-five\r\nyards from its starting-point, was totally wrecked. The great things of\r\nthe air have most of them been done by survivors from wrecks. Mr. de\r\nHavilland went to work again on a much improved machine, designed to be\r\nan army biplane; in December 1910 he became a member of the staff of the\r\nballoon factory at Farnborough, and had a main hand, as shall be told\r\nhereafter, in the best of the Government aeroplane designs.\r\n\r\nThese are instances only; the story of progress is everywhere the same.\r\nThe wonderful national air force was built by the skill and intelligence\r\nof a few men out of the mass of material offered to them by the private\r\npioneers. The work of these pioneers can best be concisely described in\r\nconnexion with the various centres, or aerodromes, where they gathered\r\ntogether to put their ideas to the test of practice. Not all the early\r\nexperimenters were attracted to these communities; some preferred to\r\nwork in secret; but the most fruitful work was done in open fellowship.\r\nAmong those who, in the days before aerodromes, devoted time and effort\r\nto the problem of flight, Mr. Jose Weiss deserves more than a passing\r\nmention. After experimenting with models, he devised a man-carrying\r\nbird-like glider, twenty-four feet in span, and in the year 1905, while\r\nflight was still no more than a rumour, flew it successfully on the\r\nslopes of Amberley Mount, between Arundel and Pulborough. His pilots\r\nwere Mr. Gordon England and Mr. Gerald Leake. The former of these, in a\r\nwind of about twenty-five miles an hour, rose some hundred feet above\r\nhis starting-point and then glided safely to earth again. The machine,\r\nsays Mr. Weiss, who, shortly before his death in 1919, kindly furnished\r\nthis account, had no vertical rudder, and relied on ailerons only, so\r\nthat it was difficult to steer. 'The combination of ailerons', he adds,\r\n'with the vertical rudder introduced by the brothers Wright was the\r\nfactor which determined the advent of the aeroplane.' The advent of the\r\naeroplane and its development for war purposes has given an air of\r\nantiquity to the researches of Mr. Weiss. Yet many subtle and delicate\r\nproblems connected with soaring and gliding flight are still unsolved;\r\nthere was no time for them during the war. Mr. Weiss was firmly\r\nconvinced that in moving currents of air flight without an engine is\r\npossible, though he did not under-estimate the difficulties to be\r\nsurmounted. His glider was inherently stable, and had funds been\r\navailable, might have been made into an efficient power-driven machine.\r\nThe Etrich glider, which was invented at about the same time in Austria\r\nand closely resembles the Weiss machine, became the model and basis for\r\nthe famous German Taube type of monoplane.\r\n\r\nOnce flying had begun in England it was not very long before home-built\r\naeroplanes were obtainable. Most of the pioneers built their own\r\nmachines. The first aeroplane factory for the supply of machines to\r\ncustomers was set up by Mr. T. Howard Wright in two of the arches of\r\nthe London, Chatham and Dover Railway at Battersea, alongside of certain\r\nother arches occupied by the balloon factory of Messrs. Eustace and\r\nOswald Short, who were at that time the official balloon constructors to\r\nthe Aero Club. Like the Voisins in France Mr. Howard Wright put his\r\nskill at the service of others. During the winter of 1908-9 he was\r\nengaged in building experimental aeroplanes of strange design, chiefly\r\nfor foreign customers. His own biplane, which resembled the Henri Farman\r\nmachine, made its appearance in 1910. He also built a type of monoplane,\r\nknown as the Avis, for the Scottish Aviation Company, a firm in which\r\nthe Hon. Alan Boyle and Mr. J. Herbert Spottiswoode were interested. On\r\nthis monoplane Mr. Boyle made the first cross-country trip in England;\r\nthe trip lasted for five minutes, and was made over the ground just\r\noutside the Brooklands track. It was on this monoplane also that Mr.\r\nSopwith, who understood motor racing, rapidly learned to fly, and a\r\nlittle later, before he became a designer and manufacturer, it was on a\r\nHoward Wright biplane that he flew from Eastchurch to a point in\r\nBelgium, thus winning Baron de Forest's prize for the longest flight\r\ninto the continent of Europe. After a time Mr. Howard Wright joined the\r\nCoventry Ordnance Works, where he built a machine for the Military\r\nTrials of 1912, and he subsequently took charge of the aviation\r\ndepartment of the torpedo-boat firm of Messrs. J. S. White and Co. of\r\nCowes.\r\n\r\nThe Short brothers followed suit. After seeing Wilbur Wright fly at Le\r\nMans, in 1908, Mr. Eustace Short engaged the help of his brother, Mr.\r\nHorace Short, who was an expert in steam-turbines, and they established\r\na primitive aerodrome at Shellness, on the marshes of the Isle of\r\nSheppey, near the terminus of the Sheppey Railway. Here the more\r\nenthusiastic of the members of the Aero Club set to work with\r\naeroplanes. The leading pioneers were Mr. Frank McClean, Mr. Alec\r\nOgilvie, Mr. Moore-Brabazon, and Mr. Percy Grace, all of whom at a later\r\ndate held commissions in one or other of the national air services; and\r\ntwo more, who held no such commissions, because before the Flying Corps\r\nwas in being they had given their lives to the cause--Mr. Cecil Grace\r\nand the Hon. Charles Rolls. None of these men was in the business for\r\nprofit, they were sportsmen and something more than sportsmen; they\r\nloved the new adventure and they spent their own money freely, but\r\npleasure was not their goal; they understood what flying meant for the\r\nwelfare of their country, and they worked for the safety and progress of\r\nthe British Empire. It was at Shellness in October 1909 that Mr.\r\nMoore-Brabazon, on a machine designed and built by Mr. Horace Short and\r\nfitted with a Green engine, flew the first circular mile ever flown on a\r\nBritish aeroplane. There were many other experiments and achievements at\r\nShellness. These were the days, says Mr. C. G. Grey (to whose knowledge\r\nof early aviation this book is much indebted), when the watchers lay\r\nflat on the ground in order to be sure that the aeroplane had really\r\nleft it. At the close of 1909, Mr. Frank McClean, who devoted his whole\r\nfortune to the cause of aviation, purchased a large tract of ground,\r\nlevel and free from ditches, in the middle of the Isle of Sheppey, close\r\nto the railway station at Eastchurch, and gave the use of it free to the\r\nAero Club. To this ground the Short brothers, who, besides building\r\ntheir own machines, had taken over the Wright patents for Great Britain,\r\nremoved their factory, and Eastchurch very quickly became the scientific\r\ncentre of British aviation. Early in 1911 the Admiralty were persuaded\r\nto allow four naval officers to learn to fly. The machines on which they\r\nlearned were supplied free of cost by Mr. McClean, and another member\r\nof the Aero Club, Mr. G. B. Cockburn, who was the solitary\r\nrepresentative of Great Britain at the Rheims meeting of 1909, supplied\r\nthe tuition, also free of cost. The instructor naturally marked out for\r\nthis purpose, says Mr. Cockburn, was Mr. Cecil Grace, a fine pilot, a\r\ngreat sportsman, and a man quite untouched by the spirit of\r\ncommercialism, but only a few weeks earlier he had been lost while\r\nflying over the Channel from France to England. So Mr. Cockburn\r\nundertook the task, and for about six weeks took up his residence at\r\nEastchurch. The four naval officers were Lieutenants C. R. Samson, R.\r\nGregory, and A. M. Longmore, of the Royal Navy; and Captain E. L.\r\nGerrard, of the Royal Marine Light Infantry. They were keen and apt\r\npupils, as they needs must have been to qualify for their certificates\r\nin six weeks of bad weather, which included one considerable snow-storm.\r\nInstruction in those days was no easy matter; the machines were pushers;\r\nthe pilot sat in front with the control on his right hand, the pupil sat\r\nhuddled up behind the instructor, catching hold of the control by\r\nstretching his arm over the instructor's shoulder, and getting\r\noccasional jabs in the forearm from the instructor's elbows as a hint to\r\nlet go. Mr. Cockburn weighed over fourteen stone, and Captain Gerrard\r\nonly a little less, so the old fifty horse-power Gnome engine had all it\r\ncould do to get the machine off the ground. In a straight flight along\r\nthe aerodrome the height attained was often no more than from twenty to\r\nthirty feet; then the machine had to make a turn at that dangerously\r\nsmall elevation, or fly into the trees at the end. Fortunately the\r\naerodrome was clear except for a few week-end pilots who practised on\r\nSaturdays and Sundays; the instructor and his pupils were energetic,\r\nflying at dawn and at dusk to avoid the high winds; and the training was\r\ncompleted with only two crashes, neither of them very serious. The navy\r\npupils were encouraged throughout by frequent visits from their senior\r\nofficer at Sheerness, Captain Godfrey Paine, who befriended aviation\r\nfrom the first. Eastchurch soon became the recognized centre for the\r\ntraining of naval officers in the use of aeroplanes, and when, upon the\r\ndeath of Mr. Horace Short, in 1917, the Short brothers vacated\r\nEastchurch, and concentrated at their Rochester works, Eastchurch passed\r\nwholly under naval control. No honour or reward that could be given to\r\nthe members of the Royal Aero Club, and especially to Mr. McClean and\r\nMr. Cockburn, can possibly equal this, that they were part founders of\r\nthe Naval Air Service.\r\n\r\nIf Eastchurch was the earliest centre of scientific experiment and\r\npractical training in aviation, it was at the great Brooklands aerodrome\r\nthat flying first became popular. Mr. Roe had been allowed to use a shed\r\nin the paddock for his first aeroplane, and had made his first flight\r\nthere, at a very humble elevation, but the conversion of the centre of\r\nthe track into an aerodrome was not effected till late in 1909. The\r\nmotor-racing track, about three and a half miles in length, enclosed a\r\npiece of land which was partly farmland and partly wilderness, watered\r\nby the river Wey. On the west side of it there was the Weybridge sewage\r\nfarm, which, when flying began, added new terrors to a forced descent.\r\nWhen Mr. Henri Farman visited England, in January 1908, he inspected\r\nBrooklands and expressed an unfavourable opinion of its fitness as a\r\nsite for an aerodrome. So nothing was done until the visit of M. Louis\r\nPaulhan, late in 1909. The performances of M. Paulhan at the Rheims\r\nmeeting, and later at the Blackpool meeting, excited much admiration,\r\nand Mr. G. Holt Thomas, who had long studied aviation, and never grew\r\ntired of advocating its claims, determined to engage popular interest\r\nand, if possible, official support by bringing Paulhan to London, there\r\nto display his powers. By arrangement with Mr. Locke King, the\r\nproprietor of Brooklands, and Major Lindsay Lloyd, the new manager, one\r\nof the fields of the farm was cleared of obstacles and was mowed and\r\nrolled, as a landing ground for Paulhan. There in the closing days of\r\nOctober 1909 Paulhan gave many exhibition flights on a Farman biplane.\r\nThe longest of these, which lasted nearly three hours and covered\r\nninety-six miles, was made on the 1st of November and was witnessed by\r\nLord Roberts. The exhibition was not a financial success; thousands of\r\nspectators watched the flying from outside the ground, without\r\ncontributing to the expenses; but it impressed the committee of the\r\nBrooklands Automobile Racing Club, and they resolved to turn the\r\ninterior of their track into an aerodrome. Obstacles were removed, pits\r\nand ponds were filled in, the solider portions of the ground were\r\nfurnished with a fairly good grass surface, rows of wooden sheds were\r\nerected, and the pioneers of the new art were invited by public\r\nadvertisement to become their tenants. By the spring of 1910 many\r\naeroplanes were at work on the Brooklands ground, most of them running\r\nabout it in the earnest endeavour to get up sufficient speed to rise\r\ninto the air.\r\n\r\nThere were no instructors. Among the earliest of the pioneers was the\r\nHon. Alan Boyle, and an account which he has kindly supplied, telling\r\nhow he learned to fly his little Avis machine, describes the usual\r\nmethod of the learners. 'I asked Mr. Howard Wright', he says, 'to build\r\nme this monoplane, which we placed upon the market as proprietors....\r\nShe was fitted with an Anzani engine of nominal twenty-five horse-power,\r\nbut which really gave about eighteen to twenty horse-power.... She\r\nusually ran for about five minutes, and then got overheated and tired\r\nand struck work.... I took my little Avis to Brooklands about February\r\n1910, after it had been exhibited at the Aero Show. I partitioned off a\r\ncorner of my shed, and slept in a hammock, so that I was able to take\r\nadvantage of the still hours in the early morning. It is amusing to look\r\nback now and remember how I used to watch anxiously a little flag which\r\nI flew above my shed, to see what strength of wind was blowing. At first\r\nI never used to go out until the flag was practically hanging from the\r\nmast, or was only flapping very gently in the light air, which occurred\r\nusually in the very early morning. At that time there were at\r\nBrooklands, I think, the following: Grahame-White, who was even then a\r\ncomparatively experienced pilot; Charles Lane, who like me had brought\r\nout a monoplane, but with a curious tail, a fixed cambered surface with\r\nanother elevating plane above and within eight inches or so of it.\r\nHowever, it flew very steadily indeed, when it was tested some months\r\nlater.... A. V. Roe was also there experimenting with his triplanes.\r\nLater on he got them flying well. He did the most astonishing things\r\nwith them. They were beautiful little machines and beautifully built,\r\nand it was a delight to watch them in the air. It was wonderful the way\r\nin which they answered to the helm. He used to go straight to a point,\r\nput his rudder over, and without any fuss or \"bank\" or anything, you\r\nwould suddenly find the machine pointing in the exact opposite\r\ndirection.... Then there were also there, with Bleriot machines, Messrs.\r\nJames Radley and Graham Gilmour. The latter was afterwards killed.\r\nRadley got his certificate on the same day as I. We were all learners at\r\nBrooklands in those days: I am the possessor of a silver cup kindly\r\npresented by the Brooklands Race Club authorities for making a circular\r\nflight, which shows we were not very advanced. In fact no one except\r\nGrahame-White and A. V. Roe knew anything about it at all, and they\r\ndidn't know much.\r\n\r\n'I started by simply rolling about the ground in the ordinary way, and\r\nthen in a short time opened her out and made short hops in an endeavour\r\nto get off the ground. I remember quite well, after I had been out,\r\nwalking along my wheel tracks and examining them, and being fearfully\r\npleased when I saw them disappear for a yard or two. That showed that I\r\nhad flown.\r\n\r\n'After I had done this sort of thing for about a month, Mr. Manning came\r\ndown and produced a larger jet for my engine, and warned me that if the\r\nmachine would fly, she would do so now with the extra power the new jet\r\nwould give the engine. He then sat down to pick up the pieces, and off I\r\nwent! After making a few hops to get my hand in I opened her out and\r\nmade a long steady flight of about a hundred yards, six feet up, and\r\nlanded shouting. I had waited and worked for that for some time, so you\r\ncan imagine my delight.\r\n\r\n'I did \"straights\" for some weeks and then started to do curves, and of\r\ncourse the banking of the machine terrified me. However, I grew used to\r\nthat, and made my curves shorter and shorter until at last I thought I\r\nwould try for a circle. I pointed the Avis to a part of the ground which\r\nhad not yet been levelled, and of course once I was over that I jolly\r\nwell had to get round somehow: so I made my first circuit. After I had\r\nbeen doing circuits for some time and had begun to have a little\r\nconfidence in myself, I decided that it was necessary to do a\r\n_volplane_. I made inquiries and was told that immediately I shut off\r\nthe engine it was necessary to put the nose of the machine down to\r\napproximately her gliding angle, otherwise she would \"stall\" and glide\r\nback on her tail. You will sympathize with me when I say that I\r\npreferred to avoid this latter alternative, although as a matter of\r\nfact, having a flat tail which carried no weight, she would no doubt\r\nhave taken up her gliding angle naturally. Anyway, I didn't know this,\r\nand in April (I think) in some trepidation I got over that step in my\r\nprogress. I confess that I went four times round Brooklands with my hand\r\non the switch before I could make up my mind to do the deed, and of\r\ncourse when I did so, I found there was nothing in it, and realized the\r\ndelight of coming down without the noise of the engine in my ears. So\r\nmuch for learning to fly.'\r\n\r\nBrooklands was a well-known place; large crowds of people had often\r\nvisited it to see the motor races; and it was near London; so that from\r\nthe first it attracted sportsmen and aeroplane designers. It became the\r\nexperimental ground of the British aircraft industry. Among its early\r\ntenants were the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company, founded by the\r\nlate Sir George White of Bristol, and commonly known as the Bristol\r\nCompany; Messrs. Martin and Handasyde, the makers of the Martinsyde\r\nmachines; Mr. A. V. Roe; the Scottish Aviation Company, with their Avis\r\nmonoplanes; Mr. J. V. Neal, who, in the endeavour to avoid the Wrights'\r\npatents, produced a curious biplane with a new system of control, and\r\nmany others. Sheds were occupied by Mr. Douglas Graham Gilmour, one of\r\nthe finest pilots in his day that this country had produced, who was\r\nkilled in an accident at Richmond, and by Mr. F. P. Raynham, who became\r\nnotable as a test-pilot. Many sportsmen rented sheds and tried their\r\nhands at building machines. Mrs. Hewlett, the wife of the novelist,\r\nhaving learned to fly, started a school at Brooklands in partnership\r\nwith M. Blondeau, a French engineer and pilot. Her son, like the\r\nswallows, was taught to fly by his mother. By the middle of 1911 a whole\r\nvillage of sheds had grown up. Most of the tenants were men of means,\r\nbut they spent so much money on their experiments that they had very\r\nlittle left for the amenities of life. Mr. C. G. Grey remembers men, the\r\npossessors of comfortable incomes, who lived for years on thirty or\r\nforty shillings a week, and spent the rest on their aeroplanes. It was\r\na society like the early Christians; it practised fellowship and\r\ncommunity of goods. To the eyes of a casual visitor there was no\r\napparent difference between the owner of an aeroplane and his mechanics;\r\nall alike lived in overalls, except in hot weather, when overalls gave\r\nplace to pyjamas. If any one lacked tools or materials he borrowed them\r\nfrom another shed; they were lent with goodwill, though the owner knew\r\nthat his only chance of seeing them again was to borrow them back. The\r\nsocial centre of the place was a shed in the middle of the front row,\r\nwhich was let by Major Lindsay Lloyd as a restaurant, and was called\r\n'The Blue Bird'. This restaurant was run by the wife of one of the\r\ncommunity; it united in itself all the utilities of a public-house, a\r\nclub, a parliament, and a town-hall. Living as they did for ends of\r\ntheir own and apart from the great world, the brotherhood naturally took\r\npride in themselves as a chosen people, dedicated to high purposes, and\r\nthey scorned the Philistines who came in crowds to see the motor racing.\r\nOn race days the Philistines were permitted, for reasons connected with\r\nthe balance sheet, to have tea at 'The Blue Bird'; some of them would\r\nwander over the aerodrome, and even into the sheds, to ask the sort of\r\nquestion that is often asked by those who will not undertake the\r\nliabilities but think it graceful to assume the airs of a patron.\r\n\r\nAfter a few years, when aeroplane construction and design settled down\r\ninto a regular industry, the glory of this primitive Arcadian community\r\npassed away, and its members were scattered far and wide. Brooklands\r\nbecame a place of business; in one row of sheds the Bristol Company, in\r\nanother Messrs. Vickers, established schools where many distinguished\r\npilots who served their country in the war learned to make their first\r\nflights. Before the war broke out the British branch of the Bleriot\r\nCompany had also taken a number of sheds, and had transformed them into\r\na regular aircraft factory; the Martin and Handasyde firm had adapted\r\nthree or four sheds, and were building a couple of monoplanes for a\r\ntransatlantic attempt by that brilliant flyer, the late Mr. Gustav\r\nHamel. In June of 1914 he was drowned in flying the English Channel, and\r\nthe firm suffered a severe set-back. Lastly, when the war came, the\r\nBrooklands aerodrome, with all its flyable machines, was taken over by\r\nthe military authorities, and the days of ease and innocence were ended.\r\nA large Vickers factory was built, and turned out many machines for the\r\nFlying Corps; the Bleriot and the Martinsyde firms also continued their\r\nactivities for a couple of years, and then moved, the one to Addlestone,\r\nthe other to Woking. During the war Brooklands was used as a training\r\nstation, a wireless experimental depot, and an acceptance park by the\r\nRoyal Flying Corps, which permitted the use of it, for experimental\r\nflying, to the Vickers, Martinsyde, and Bleriot firms.\r\n\r\nOther early aerodromes, almost contemporary with Brooklands, were\r\nHendon, in the northern suburbs of London, and Larkhill, on Salisbury\r\nPlain, a few miles from Amesbury. The Hendon aerodrome, like Brooklands,\r\nowed its first fame to the initiative of Mr. Holt Thomas. After the\r\nBrooklands adventure he kept in touch with M. Louis Paulhan, and in\r\nApril 1910 persuaded him to make an attempt to win the L10,000 prize\r\noffered by the _Daily Mail_ for a flight from London to Manchester.\r\nDuring the previous winter M. Paulhan had been flying with success in\r\nAmerica, while his rival, Mr. Grahame-White, had been busy with his\r\nflying school at Pau, in the south of France. Mr. Grahame-White brought\r\na Farman biplane to London, and obtained permission to use Wormwood\r\nScrubbs for his starting-place. Mr. Holt Thomas, looking for a\r\nstarting-place for Paulhan, heard of a field at Hendon which was being\r\nused by a firm of electrical engineers for experiments with a small\r\nmonoplane, and got leave to start Paulhan thence. After Paulhan's\r\nsuccess, Mr. Grahame-White and his business partner, the late Mr.\r\nRichard T. Gates, visited Hendon, and finding that the field was one of\r\na number bordering the Midland Railway without any roads cutting across\r\nthem, fixed on the place as the site of what was afterwards called the\r\nLondon aerodrome. Here the Grahame-White Aviation Company made it their\r\nbusiness, from 1911 onwards, to familiarize Londoners with the spectacle\r\nof flying and with its practice. They built a number of sheds and let\r\nthem to manufacturing firms. One of these was the Aircraft Manufacturing\r\nCompany, formed in 1911 by Mr. Holt Thomas, who at that time was working\r\nthe British rights for the French Farman Company. Another was the W. H.\r\nEwen Aviation Company, which subsequently became the British Caudron\r\nCompany. A third was the British Deperdussin Company; the wonderful\r\nlittle Deperdussin monoplane, in the 1912 Gordon Bennett Trials at\r\nRheims, carried its pilot, M. Vedrines, at a speed of nearly two miles a\r\nminute for a flight of over an hour. Hendon, moreover, laid itself out\r\nto attract spectators. There were stands and enclosures, with prices of\r\nadmission to suit all purses. Aeroplane racing was a regular feature of\r\nthe meetings. As early as 1911 about a hundred and twenty members of the\r\ntwo Houses of Parliament paid a visit to the place by invitation and\r\nwere some of them taken into the air. In July 1911 two great races,\r\nmodelled on the _Circuit de l'Est_ of 1910, made Hendon one of their\r\nstages. The earlier of these, somewhat magniloquently called the\r\n'Circuit of Europe', was organized by a syndicate of newspapers. The\r\nappointed course was from Paris to Paris by way of Liege, Utrecht,\r\nBrussels, and London--a distance of about a thousand miles. The second,\r\nnot many days later, organized by the _Daily Mail_ newspaper, and called\r\nthe 'Circuit of Britain', laid its course from Brooklands to Brooklands,\r\nby way of Edinburgh and Glasgow, Exeter and Brighton, with Hendon as the\r\nfirst stopping-place on the outward journey. Both competitions were won\r\nby Lieutenant Conneau of the French navy, who flew under the name of\r\n'Beaumont'. Whether because only one Englishman (Mr. James Valentine)\r\ntook part in the earlier competition, or because the second was better\r\nadvertised and first awoke the public to the significance of aviation,\r\nit was to witness the second that enthusiastic crowds first flocked to\r\nHendon. Mr. Holt Thomas, who helped to organize the 'Circuit of Europe',\r\nfound a stolid indifference in the English public. As he drove to Hendon\r\nalong the Edgware road he noticed that the people on their way to the\r\naerodrome were mostly French. Indeed, he adds, at the aerodrome itself\r\nthere were almost more police than public to witness what was a great\r\nevent in the history of flight. For the 'Circuit of Britain', on the\r\nother hand, an enormous crowd gathered at Hendon. The fields on Hendon\r\nHill were black with spectators. One farmer, remembering to make hay\r\nwhile the sun shone, erected a canvas screen all along the upper part of\r\nhis field, and by charging threepence for admission to the other side\r\nreaped a good harvest. The competitors arrived on a Saturday afternoon,\r\nand left again for the north early on the Monday morning. Thousands of\r\nspectators spent Sunday night in the fields, gathering round bonfires or\r\nsinging to keep themselves warm. In this competition the French\r\nmonoplane pilots carried off the honours; Beaumont was first, and\r\nVedrines second. The only competitor who completed the full course on a\r\nBritish-built machine was the stalwart and persevering Mr. Cody on his\r\nown biplane.\r\n\r\nThe man who makes a machine and the man who flies one are the heroes of\r\nthe epic of flight. Next to them, all credit must be given to the\r\npublic-spirited financiers and patrons who encouraged flight, especially\r\nto those of them who were not deceived, and knew that they are the\r\nservants, not the masters, of the conquerors of the air. As a promoter\r\nof flight Mr. Holt Thomas deserves more than a passing mention. He\r\nworked early and late for the progress of the art and for its\r\nrecognition by the Government. He was fond of calling attention to\r\ncomparative figures, pointing out, for instance, in April 1909, that the\r\nsum already spent by Germany on military aeronautics was about L400,000;\r\nby France about L47,000; and by Great Britain about L5,000. He\r\nbefriended and rewarded distinguished aviators. In September 1910 he\r\nattended the military manoeuvres in France, the first in which\r\naeroplanes were used for reconnaissance, and there, among the experts of\r\nmany nations, came across no other Englishman. He also attended the\r\nBritish manoeuvres of the same year, where Captain Bertram Dickson made\r\nsome reconnaissance flights. In 1911 he founded the Aircraft\r\nManufacturing Company. He foresaw a great future for military aviation\r\nand constantly did battle with the argument, fashionable among some\r\nsoldiers, that the British army, being a small army, required only a\r\nsmall air force. He held, from the first, that a national air force had\r\nmany tasks to fulfil other than reconnaissance, and that it should be a\r\nseparate organization, distinct from both army and navy. Men like Mr.\r\nThomas, who, though they had no official standing, devoted study and\r\neffort to the problems of military aviation, were not a little\r\nserviceable to the country; they agitated the question, and kept it\r\nalive in the public mind. When the Royal Flying Corps at last was formed\r\nthey might justly claim that they had helped it into existence.\r\n\r\nThe only other aerodrome which need here be mentioned is the Larkhill\r\naerodrome, often called the Salisbury Plain aerodrome, or the Bristol\r\nFlying School. Eastchurch saw the beginnings of naval flying; Larkhill\r\nwas the earliest centre of military flying. In 1909 Captain J. D. B.\r\nFulton, of the Royal Field Artillery, was stationed at Bulford camp. M.\r\nBleriot's cross-Channel flight, in July of that year, excited his\r\ninterest, and he set himself to build a monoplane of the Bleriot type.\r\nThis proved to be a slow business, so he bought from the Grahame-White\r\nfirm a Bleriot machine fitted with a twenty-eight horse-power Anzani\r\nengine, and began to experiment with it on the plain. Captain Fulton was\r\na highly skilled mechanical engineer; some of his patents for\r\nimprovements in field guns had been adopted by the War Office, and from\r\nthe proceeds of these he was able to meet the costs of his experiments.\r\nHis title to be called the founder of military aviation in Great Britain\r\nmust be shared with others, especially with Captain Bertram Dickson,\r\nalso of the Royal Field Artillery, who was the first British officer to\r\nfly. After seeing the flying at the Rheims meeting in August 1909,\r\nCaptain Dickson procured a Henri Farman biplane, and learned, at\r\nChalons, to fly it. He was a natural flyer, as Captain Fulton was a\r\nnatural engineer. During 1910 he attended many aviation meetings in\r\nFrance; at Tours and elsewhere he held his own in competition with some\r\nof the most famous of French aviators. His ruling passion was not sport,\r\nbut patriotism; he was chiefly concerned to put the aeroplane as a\r\nweapon into the hands of his country. In the summer of 1910 he made the\r\nacquaintance of Sir George White of Bristol, and joined the staff of the\r\nBritish and Colonial Aeroplane Company. At the army manoeuvres of that\r\nautumn he appeared, a herald of the future, on a Bristol biplane, but\r\nfound some difficulty in persuading the officers in command to make use\r\nof his services. The cavalry, in particular, were not friendly to the\r\naeroplane, which, it was believed, would frighten the horses; and when a\r\nreconnaissance flight was arranged and had to be put off because the\r\nwind was high and gusty, aviation fell in esteem. Nevertheless, some of\r\nCaptain Dickson's flights served to show how an aeroplane might help an\r\narmy. It was natural enough that the cavalry should prefer to carry on\r\nthe work of reconnaissance in the usual way. Men believe in the weapons\r\nthey are skilled to handle. When the rapier was introduced into England\r\nin the sixteenth century, it found no friends among the masters of the\r\nbroadsword; its vogue was gained among young gentlemen educated in\r\nFrance and Italy. To let an aeroplane attempt their work would have\r\nseemed to the cavalry like dropping the bone to catch at the shadow. But\r\nyouth will be served, and in a very few years the shadow cast by Captain\r\nDickson's aeroplane spread and multiplied and covered the field of\r\nbattle. His own career came to an untimely end. A few weeks after the\r\nmanoeuvres he suffered a severe accident at the Milan aviation meeting,\r\nwhere he performed some of those admirable glides from a height, with\r\nthe engine off, for which he had become famous. Just after one of these\r\nhe had opened the throttle of his engine, and was rising again, when\r\nanother aviator, called Thomas, who was rapidly planing down on an\r\nAntoinette, crashed into him from above. He lay between life and death\r\nfor some weeks, and in his delirium talked incessantly of his work, and\r\nof the War Office, and of what he hoped to do for it. His health had\r\nbeen severely strained by the early work he had done in tropical\r\ncountries, where he had been employed in exploration and the\r\ndelimitation of boundaries; though he recovered from his accident and\r\nflew again, he grew steadily worse, and died in Scotland on the 28th of\r\nSeptember 1913.\r\n\r\nAlong with Captain Fulton and Captain Dickson a third army aviator must\r\nbe mentioned--Lieutenant Lancelot Gibbs, who also learned to fly at\r\nChalons, and was present, on a Farman biplane, at the manoeuvres of\r\n1910. At the Wolverhampton meeting, earlier in the same year, he had had\r\na slight accident which injured his spine, so that before very long he\r\nhad to give up flying. He had flown at many early meetings, and had\r\ndistinguished himself in duration flights. The dangers encountered by\r\nthese pioneers may be illustrated from the experiences of Lieutenant\r\nGibbs in Spain. He had arranged to give an exhibition of flying at\r\nDurango, near Bilbao, in April 1910. The delivery of his machine, which\r\nwas sent from Paris by the Spanish railways, was delayed, and many hours\r\nof work had to be spent on it before it could fly, so that the thirty\r\nthousand people who had assembled were kept waiting for more than an\r\nhour. They grew impatient, and when the machine was wheeled out of its\r\nshed, so that they might see the work of preparing it, they crowded\r\nround it and handled it roughly. It had to be taken back into the shed\r\nagain. Thereupon they began to throw stones, which disabled the mechanic\r\nand broke the shed. One of them advanced to Lieutenant Gibbs with a\r\ndrawn knife and said that flying was an impossibility, there was no such\r\nthing as aviation, and therefore they were going to knife him. The crowd\r\nshouted 'Down with science, long live religion!' Lieutenant Gibbs saved\r\nhimself by his courage and calm, and was taken away by an escort, under\r\na heavy shower of stones, to the judge's house. Within half an hour the\r\nshed, with all it contained, was burned to the ground.\r\n\r\nThese three soldiers, Captain Fulton, Captain Dickson, and Lieutenant\r\nGibbs, have earned their place in history as the first British military\r\naviators. Of the three Captain Fulton had most to do with Salisbury\r\nPlain and the beginnings of the air force. Some civilians were also at\r\nwork. During the manoeuvres of 1910 Mr. Robert Loraine, in a Bristol\r\nmachine fitted with transmitting apparatus, succeeded in sending\r\nwireless messages, from a distance of a quarter of a mile, to a\r\ntemporary receiving station rigged up at Larkhill. The earliest\r\npermanent establishment at Larkhill seems to have been an aeroplane shed\r\ntenanted by Mr. H. Barber, who subsequently held a commission in the Air\r\nForce. Mr. Barber was a man of independent means, and being convinced\r\nthat flying would play a great part in war, he spent his time in\r\ndevising aeroplanes for naval and military purposes. He founded a firm\r\nof his own, called 'The Aeronautical Syndicate', and produced a type of\r\nmonoplane with elevator in front, which, in its later development, was\r\nnamed the 'Valkyrie'. He taught a good many people to fly, but none of\r\nthem, except himself, became expert pilots. The 'Valkyrie' was the last\r\nsurvivor of the earliest type of flying machine, often called the\r\n'Canard' type, because the elevator is extended in front like the head\r\nof a duck in flight, and serves to balance the machine. When this type\r\nof machine was at last superseded by the more shapely modern design, Mr.\r\nBarber's syndicate died a natural death. At the outbreak of war he\r\njoined the Royal Flying Corps, and became one of its leading technical\r\ninstructors, with the rank of captain.\r\n\r\nThe second shed erected at Larkhill was built by the War Office and was\r\nintended for the use of the Hon. C. S. Rolls, so that he might give\r\ninstruction to army pilots. The death of Mr. Rolls at the Bournemouth\r\nmeeting in July 19th (one of the heaviest losses that aviation has\r\nsuffered in this country) put an end to that scheme, and the shed was\r\nassigned, later on, to Captain Fulton. The third shed was erected by Mr.\r\nG. B. Cockburn, who on his return from France applied to the War Office\r\nfor leave to carry on at Larkhill. Mr. Cockburn was the first, he says,\r\nactually to fly over Salisbury Plain. He worked hand in hand with\r\nCaptain Fulton, to whom he lent his Farman machine (the first machine\r\nbuilt by Henri Farman after he left the Voisin firm) in order that\r\nCaptain Fulton might pass the tests for the pilot's certificate in\r\nNovember 1910. The two together did much good work at Larkhill, and were\r\nsuccessful in gaining a certain measure of recognition for the aeroplane\r\namong the army units on the plain.\r\n\r\nFrom these beginnings Larkhill rapidly developed. Towards the end of\r\n1910 the Bristol Company, having come to an agreement with the War\r\nOffice, established themselves at Larkhill in a solidly built row of\r\nsheds. The Government were not as yet prepared to undertake any large\r\nexpenditure upon aeroplanes; their attitude was tentative; they had been\r\nadvised by the Committee of Imperial Defence that the experiments with\r\naeroplanes, hitherto carried out at the balloon school, should be\r\ndiscontinued, but that advantage should be taken of private enterprise\r\nin this branch of aeronautics. Accordingly, the Bristol Company opened\r\nat Larkhill the Bristol School of Aviation, which remained in existence\r\nuntil the outbreak of the war. The chief instructor was M. Henry\r\nJullerot, one of the best pilots in France; he was assisted by Mr.\r\nGordon England, who had shown so much skill in handling the gliders of\r\nMr. Weiss, and by Mr. Harry Busteed, the first notable Australian pilot.\r\nSalisbury Plain is perhaps the best stretch of country in England for\r\nthe training of aviators; the school grew and prospered; the Bristol\r\nmachine proved to be excellently well fitted for the purposes of\r\ninstruction, and the pupils, being relieved from the dangers that attend\r\na forced landing in populous country, distinguished themselves by their\r\nbold flying. There were many camps of soldiers in the neighbourhood, so\r\nthat the work done at Larkhill did much to convert the army to a belief\r\nin aviation. The tokens of the conversion were soon visible. On the 28th\r\nof February 1911 an Army Order was issued, creating the Air Battalion of\r\nthe Royal Engineers. It ran as follows: 'With a view to meeting Army\r\nrequirements consequent on recent developments in aerial science it has\r\nbeen decided to organize an Air Battalion, to which will be entrusted\r\nthe duty of creating a body of expert airmen.... The training and\r\ninstruction of men in handling kites, balloons and aeroplanes, and other\r\nforms of aircraft, will also devolve upon this battalion. The\r\nestablishment of this battalion will be organized into (i) headquarters\r\nand (ii) two companies.... The officers will be selected from any\r\nregular arm or branch of the Service on the active list.... A selected\r\ncandidate will, on joining the Air Battalion, go through a six months'\r\nprobationary course.... An officer who satisfactorily completes the\r\nprobationary period will be appointed to the Air Battalion for a period\r\nof four years.... The Warrant officers, non-commissioned officers, and\r\nmen will be selected from the Corps of Royal Engineers. The existing\r\nBalloon School will be superseded by the Air Battalion, and the new\r\norganization will be regarded as taking effect from April 1st, 1911.'\r\n\r\nThe formation of the Air Battalion was a great step in advance. Up to\r\nthis time flying had been a hobby or fancy of individual men; it was now\r\norganized and provided for as a part of the duty of the army. The\r\nbattalion was duly formed under the command of Sir Alexander Bannerman,\r\nwith Captain P. W. L. Broke-Smith, of the Royal Engineers, as adjutant.\r\nAirships were assigned to No. 1 Company and aeroplanes to No. 2 Company.\r\nThis latter company, commanded by Captain Fulton, went into camp at\r\nLarkhill about the end of April. When Mr. Cockburn, after completing\r\nthe course of instruction that he gave at Eastchurch, returned to\r\nLarkhill, he found the battalion in process of formation. Its history,\r\nand its development, a year later, into the Royal Flying Corps, must be\r\nnarrated in the next chapter, and the steps traced by which a small\r\nballoon factory at Chatham, started in the year 1882, was transformed\r\ninto the Air Force of to-day. A few words may here be added concerning\r\nCaptain Fulton and Mr. Cockburn, who bore so large a part in the\r\ncreation of an air force. While he held his command in the Air\r\nBattalion, Captain Fulton did all he could to get it recognized as a\r\nseparate branch of the army, distinct from the Royal Engineers. When the\r\nRoyal Flying Corps was formed he was appointed to the Central Flying\r\nSchool as instructor, and was put in charge of the workshops there.\r\nThence he passed to the aeronautical inspection department, which was\r\nplaced entirely under his control and became, what it has remained, one\r\nof the foundations of the strength and efficiency of the air force. He\r\ncould not be spared from this work for combatant service, so he saw\r\nlittle of the war at the front; but more flying officers than ever heard\r\nhis name owe him a debt of gratitude for his faithful work in providing\r\nfor their safety. He died of an affection of the throat in November\r\n1915. Mr. Cockburn, who was continuously at work on Salisbury Plain for\r\na period of something like four years, continued, as a civilian, to give\r\nhis help, first in the aeronautical inspection department, and, later\r\non, in the investigation of aeroplane accidents.\r\n\r\nThe account which has now been given of the early years of flying in\r\nEngland may serve to show what a wealth of private enterprise lay ready\r\nto the hand of the Government when the building of the air force began.\r\nThe Royal Air Force, like the tree of the Gospel parable, grew from a\r\nsmall seed, but it was nourished in a rich soil. The great experiment\r\nof flying attracted a multitude of adventurous minds, and prepared\r\nrecruits for the nation long before the nation asked for them. This\r\nearly predominance of private enterprise, it is worth remarking, told in\r\nfavour of military rather than naval flying, and, when the Flying Corps\r\nwas formed, started the Military Wing at an advantage. Little has been\r\nsaid as yet, because in truth there is little to say, of pioneer work in\r\nthe air done by sailors. Yet no one would dare to assert that the\r\naverage sailor is less resourceful, less inventive, less open to new\r\nideas, than the average soldier. No doubt there were many senior\r\nofficers in the navy, as there were many in the army, who in the early\r\ndays regarded aviation with professional impatience and scorn. Further,\r\nthe higher command of the navy were not quick, when aircraft became\r\npractically efficient, to divine or devise a use for them. The\r\ndifficulty of employing them over the sea was formidable, and none of\r\ntheir uses was quite so obvious as their use (questioned by more than\r\none distinguished army general) for reconnaissance in a land campaign.\r\nBut the real difference which told in favour of military aviation lay in\r\nthe nature of the services. A sailor is attached to his ship, and flying\r\nis an art which of necessity must be practised and developed, in its\r\nbeginnings, over wide level tracts of land. The value of the airship for\r\ndistant reconnaissance at sea is now fully recognized, but airship\r\nbuilding is not a possible hobby for a young naval officer. Those naval\r\nofficers who believed in the future of the new weapon were reduced to\r\nattempting to influence the Government, so that it might undertake the\r\nnecessary work. While the army officer could attend aviation meetings\r\nand demonstrate his opinions in practice, his less fortunate brother in\r\nthe navy had no resource but to engage in a melancholy course of\r\npolitics, with small prospects of public result, and smaller prospects\r\nof private advancement.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of all this is that the history of the work done by the\r\nnavy with aeroplanes and airships is essentially a history of official\r\ndecisions and official acts. Great credit must be given to individual\r\nnavy men for their insight and persistence in advocating the claims of\r\nthe air, but the history of the work done can be fully narrated, without\r\nfurther preamble, in an account of the origin and growth of the national\r\nair force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNINGS OF THE AIR FORCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who fear, or pretend to fear, that England may witness a\r\nrevolution like the French Revolution of the eighteenth century or the\r\nRussian Revolution of the twentieth century would be well advised to\r\ncompose their minds by the study of English history. That history, in\r\nall its parts, shows the passion of the English people for continuity of\r\ndevelopment. The first care of the practical Englishman who desires\r\nchange is to find some precedent, which may serve to give to change the\r\nauthority of ancient usage. Our laws have always been administered in\r\nthis spirit; we are willing to accept, and even to hasten, change, if we\r\ncan show that the change is no real change, but is only a reversion to\r\nan older practice, or a development of an established law. It was a\r\nsaying of King Alphonso of Aragon that among the many things which in\r\nthis life men possess or desire all the rest are baubles compared with\r\nold wood to burn, old wine to drink, old friends to converse with, and\r\nold books to read. The English people are of a like mind; what they most\r\ncare for is old customs to cherish. The very rebels of England are\r\ncareful to find an honourable pedigree for their rebellion, and to\r\ninvoke the support of their forefathers. A revolution based only on\r\ntheory, a system warranted only by thought, will never come home to\r\nEnglishmen.\r\n\r\nThe national love for continuity of development is well seen in the\r\nhistory of the genesis of the national air force. The whole of that\r\nforce, aeroplanes, airships, kite balloons, and the rest, must be\r\naffiliated to a certain small balloon detachment of the Royal Engineers\r\nat Chatham. Little by little, very slowly and gradually at first, while\r\nonly the balloon was in question, with amazing rapidity later, when the\r\naeroplane and the airship came into being and were needed for the war,\r\nthat single experimental unit of the Royal Engineers grew and\r\ntransformed itself into a vast independent organization. Names and\r\nuniforms, constitutions and regulations, were altered so often that the\r\nwhole change might seem to be an orgy of official frivolity if it were\r\nnot remembered that the powers brought within reach of man by the new\r\nscience were increasing at an even greater speed. But there was no\r\nbreach of continuity; the process was a process of growth; the new was\r\nadded, and the old was not abolished.\r\n\r\nFrom the days of the Montgolfiers for more than a century the value of\r\nthe balloon in war was a matter of debate and question and experiment.\r\nAt the battle of Fleurus, in 1794, the triumphant French republican army\r\nused a captive balloon, chiefly, perhaps, as a symbol and token of the\r\nnew era of science and liberty. Balloons were used in the Peninsular\r\nCampaign, but Napoleon's greatest achievements owed nothing to\r\nobservation from the air. Even in the American Civil War, where the\r\nFederals certainly derived some advantage from their use, balloons were\r\ncriticized and ridiculed more than they were feared. In Great Britain\r\nmilitary experiments with balloons began at Woolwich Arsenal in 1878. In\r\nthe following year Captain R. P. Lee, of the Royal Engineers, reporting\r\non the work done at the arsenal, stated that they had a thoroughly sound\r\nand reliable fleet of five balloons, and a few trained officers and men,\r\ncompetent to undertake their management. One of these balloons\r\naccompanied the troops on manoeuvre at the Easter Volunteer Review at\r\nBrighton. Captain H. Elsdale, of the Royal Engineers, who was in charge\r\nof the party, took part in the final march past; he was in the car of\r\nthe balloon at a height of two hundred and fifty feet, while Captain J.\r\nL. B. Templer, a militia officer, managed the transport on the ground. A\r\nballoon section was present at the Aldershot manoeuvres both in 1880 and\r\nin 1882; it was judged a success, and instructions were issued in the\r\nautumn of 1882 that the Balloon Equipment Store, as the establishment at\r\nWoolwich was called, should be removed to the School of Military\r\nEngineering at Chatham, where a small balloon factory, depot, and school\r\nof instruction was established in 1883. The practice with the balloons\r\nwas under the charge of Major Lee, and in that year Major Templer came\r\nto Chatham to carry out certain experiments in the manufacture of\r\nballoons. He brought with him a family of the name of Weinling, to\r\nconstruct balloons on a system devised by himself. The fabric of the\r\nballoons was the internal membrane of the lower intestine of the ox,\r\nsometimes called gold-beater's skin. The Weinling family had a secret,\r\nor what they believed to be a secret, for the secure joining together of\r\nthe pieces of this skin. As they held for some time an unchallenged\r\nmonopoly in the manufacture of aircraft for the British Empire, they\r\nhave earned the right to a niche in the temple of Fame. They were five\r\nin number--Mrs. Weinling and her elder son Fred, who were the first to\r\narrive at Chatham, her two daughters, Mary Anne and Eugene, and a\r\nyounger son Willie, who was about eighteen years old and was subject to\r\nfits. Their work was carried on not without interruption. In November\r\n1883 Major Templer wrote a letter to the president of the Royal Engineer\r\nCommittee, stating that he was delayed in the completion of the skin\r\nballoon by the principal workman having been sentenced to three months'\r\nimprisonment for an assault on the police. As the Weinling family were\r\nthe only persons who had ever worked in skin-balloon manufacture, and\r\nas he himself was the only other person acquainted with the art, Major\r\nTempler asked and obtained leave to have two sappers trained to the\r\nwork. But this new departure led before long to further troubles. The\r\nfamily were very jealous of their secret, and when the balloon factory\r\nbegan to be enlarged it was only with the greatest difficulty that the\r\nmembers of the family could be induced to give instruction to other\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the course of a year, several balloons were made, of\r\nthree sizes, the largest size having ten thousand cubic feet of\r\ncapacity, and the smaller sizes seven thousand and four thousand five\r\nhundred cubic feet. When, in the autumn of 1884, an expedition was sent\r\nto Bechuanaland under Sir Charles Warren, to expel the filibusters who\r\nhad raided the territory, to pacificate the country, and to reinstate\r\nthe natives, a balloon detachment under Major Elsdale and Captain F. C.\r\nTrollope, of the Grenadier Guards, attached to the Royal Engineers, was\r\nincluded in the expedition. They took with them in the detachment three\r\nballoons, and a staff consisting of fifteen non-commissioned officers\r\nand men. There was no fighting. At Mafeking, which was then a native\r\nvillage, it was found that owing to the elevation above sea-level\r\nneither of the two smaller balloons had lift enough to raise a man into\r\nthe air, and that the largest balloon could take up only one observer. A\r\nnative chief, Montsiou by name, went up a short distance in the balloon.\r\nThe remark that he made serves to show the value of aircraft in\r\nimpressing primitive peoples. 'If the first white men', he said, 'who\r\ncame into this country had brought a thing like that, and having gone up\r\nin it before our eyes, had then come down and demanded that we should\r\nworship and serve them, we would have done so. The English have indeed\r\ngreat power.' The chief was right. For any nation to which is entrusted\r\nthe policing and administration of large tracts of uncivilized country,\r\nan air force, civil and military, is an instrument of great power.\r\n\r\nBalloons were used again on active service in the following year, 1885,\r\nin the Soudan. A small detachment, under Major Templer with Lieutenant\r\nR. J. H. L. MacKenzie, of the Royal Engineers, and nine non-commissioned\r\nofficers and sappers, accompanied the expeditionary force. The best of\r\nthe material had been sent to Bechuanaland, so the equipment was very\r\nimperfect, but ascents made in a balloon of one of the smaller types, at\r\nEl Teb and Tamai, and elsewhere, proved useful for reconnaissance.\r\n\r\nOn the return of these two expeditions no attempt was made to keep up a\r\nregular balloon section. What was done must for the most part be\r\ncredited to the energy of those few officers who believed in the future\r\nof balloons. Majors Elsdale and Templer ran the factory for building\r\nballoons and making hydrogen, and a few non-commissioned officers,\r\ntrained in balloon work, were held on the strength of depot companies.\r\nMost of the practice, in observation of gunfire and the like, was\r\ncarried out with captive balloons; the few trips adventured in free\r\nballoons were undertaken only when the gas had so deteriorated that the\r\nballoon had not lift enough for captive work. Major Elsdale did what he\r\ncould to improve equipment, and urged that two or three officers should\r\nbe appointed to give their whole time to balloons and to form the\r\nnucleus of a balloon corps. He is himself remembered for his pioneer\r\nexperiments in aerial photography; he sent up cameras attached to small\r\nfree balloons, with a clockwork apparatus which exposed the plates at\r\nregular intervals and which finally ripped the balloon to bring it to\r\nearth again. Major Templer, for his part, took a house at Lidsing, about\r\nfour miles from Chatham and the same distance from Maidstone, and, in\r\n1887, started a small summer training camp for balloon work in one of\r\nthe fields adjoining his house. Lieutenants G. E. Phillips and C. F.\r\nClose, of the Royal Engineers, attended this camp, which was held again\r\nin the following years. In 1889 Lieutenants B. R. Ward and H. B. Jones,\r\nalso of the Royal Engineers, joined it, and the authorities were soon\r\nfaced with the necessity of coming to a decision whether balloons should\r\nbe introduced as a definite part of the service. In that year\r\nLieutenant-General Sir Evelyn Wood was in command of the Aldershot\r\nDivision; he arranged for a balloon detachment, consisting of\r\nLieutenants Ward and Jones, Sergeant-Major Wise, and some thirty\r\nnon-commissioned officers and men, to be sent to Aldershot early in the\r\nsummer to take part in the annual manoeuvres. The experiment was a\r\nsuccess. The balloons operated with a force which marched out from\r\nAldershot against a flying column of the enemy encamped near the\r\nFrensham ponds. A fortunate piece of observation work is believed to\r\nhave won Sir Evelyn Wood's favour for the new arm. The balloons were\r\nasked to answer the question, 'Has the enemy any outposts in rear of his\r\ncamp?' Lieutenant Ward made an ascent, and though it was getting dusk\r\nand the country was not very open, he was able to see the enemy placing\r\npickets round his camp on the nearer side, but could detect no movement\r\nbeyond the camp. He reported that there were no outposts in rear of the\r\ncamp; and a night attack sent out from Aldershot was a complete success.\r\n\r\nThe German Emperor was present at these same manoeuvres, and a march\r\npast on the Fox Hills was organized for his benefit. The balloon\r\ndetachment was ordered to take part in it. Balloons, being an\r\nunrecognized part of the army, were not hampered by any of those\r\nregulations which prescribe the etiquette to be observed on formal\r\noccasions. Lieutenant Ward, who was in command of the detachment,\r\nresolved that he would march past in the air, at an altitude of about\r\nthree hundred feet, in a balloon attached to the balloon wagon. The\r\nweather was fine and calm, and the balloon sailed by in state, with the\r\nresult that the spectators all gazed upwards and had not a glance to\r\nspare for the horse artillery, the cavalry, or any other arm of the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nSir Evelyn Wood reported favourably on the use of balloons, and in 1890\r\na balloon section was introduced into the British army as a unit of the\r\nRoyal Engineers. The question of a site for the depot caused some delay.\r\nOpinion favoured Aldershot, but the General Officer Commanding objected\r\nthat Aldershot should be reserved for military training. Major Templer\r\nwas in favour of Lidsing, where for several years he had carried on at\r\nhis own costs. In the result the depot moved to Aldershot, and having\r\ntaken over a piece of very soft ground at South Farnborough, near the\r\ncanal, began to erect sheds. The contractor for a balloon shed was\r\nnearly ruined by the expense of making foundations. So things\r\nfluctuated; the factory remained at Chatham, and the depot and section,\r\nafter a summer spent at Aldershot, collected at Chatham again for the\r\nwinter of 1890-1. In 1892 a definite move was made to Aldershot, which\r\ncontinued thereafter to be the centre for balloon work. In 1894 the\r\nballoon factory, under the superintendence of Colonel Templer, was fully\r\nestablished at South Farnborough. Finally, in 1905, a new and better\r\nsite was found for it in the same neighbourhood, and by successive\r\nadditions to the sheds and workshops then erected the present Royal\r\nAircraft Establishment came into being. Some difficulty is presented to\r\nthe historian by the chameleon changes of official nomenclature, which\r\ndisguise a real identity and continuity. The Balloon Equipment Store at\r\nWoolwich became the untitled factory at Chatham, which in its turn\r\nbecame the balloon factory at South Farnborough. In 1908 it was\r\ndecorated, and became His Majesty's Balloon Factory; a little later it\r\nwas named the Army Aircraft Factory; and, later again, in 1912, the\r\nRoyal Aircraft Factory. So it continued until far through the war, when,\r\nits initials being required for the newly-welded Royal Air Force, it was\r\nrenamed yet again, and was called the Royal Aircraft Establishment.\r\nThese changes in nomenclature were, of course, office-made, and have\r\nnone of the significance that attaches to the history of popular names.\r\nBut the Royal Aircraft Establishment itself was a natural growth, and\r\nderives, without break, from the unofficial establishment of balloons at\r\nWoolwich.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 the South African War began. Four balloon sections took an\r\nactive part in the campaign. The first section, commanded by Captain H.\r\nB. Jones, operated with the troops under Lord Methuen, and proved its\r\nvalue at the battle of Magersfontein. The second section, commanded by\r\nMajor G. M. Heath, was with Sir George White throughout the siege of\r\nLadysmith. An improvised section, commanded by Captain G. E. Phillips,\r\nwas raised at Cape Town, and joined Sir Redvers Buller's force at Frere\r\nCamp, for the relief of Ladysmith. The regular third section, commanded\r\nby Lieutenant R. D. B. Blakeney, embarked for South Africa early in\r\n1900, and joined the Tenth Division at Kimberley. It is not easy to make\r\na just estimate of the value of the balloons in this war. Some\r\ncommanding officers were prejudiced against them, and the difficulties\r\nand miscarriages which are inevitable in the use of a new instrument did\r\nnothing to remove the prejudice. The steel tubes in which the hydrogen\r\nwas compressed were cumbrous and heavy to transport. The artillery were\r\nnot trained to make the fullest use of the balloons; the system of\r\nsignalling by flags was very imperfect; and the signallers in the air\r\noften failed to attract the attention of those with the guns. For all\r\nthat, the balloons proved their value. The Ladysmith balloon did good\r\nservice in directing fire during the battle of Lombard's Kop, and, more\r\ngenerally, in reporting on the Boer positions. Later on in the siege it\r\nwas impossible to get gas, and the balloons fell out of use. At\r\nMagersfontein it was by observation from the air that the howitzer\r\nbatteries got the range of the enemy's ponies concealed in a gully, and\r\naccounted for more than two hundred of them. On the 26th of February\r\n1900 an officer in a balloon reported on General Cronje's main position\r\nat Paardeberg, and the report was of value in directing the attack on\r\nthe position.\r\n\r\nThese operations put a heavy strain on the factory. Its normal output of\r\none balloon a month was increased during the war to two balloons a\r\nmonth, and new buildings at a cost of more than four thousand pounds\r\nwere proposed in 1900, and approved by the Aldershot Command. Even\r\nduring the South African War there were other calls on the factory. In\r\nthe summer of 1900 a balloon section, under the command of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel J. R. Macdonald, was embarked for China; in the\r\nfollowing year the factory supplied two balloons and stores for the\r\nAntarctic Expedition of Captain Scott. These demands interfered with\r\nexperimental activities, which when the war was ended, and especially\r\nwhen the new factory was built in 1905, were renewed with great zest. As\r\nearly as January 1902 Colonel Templer, having visited Paris to report on\r\nthe doings of M. Santos Dumont, recommended that experiments with\r\ndirigible balloons should be carried out at once, but received from the\r\nWar Office the reply that the estimates for the year, which, apart from\r\nthese experiments, amounted to L12,000, must be cut down to half that\r\nsum. Nevertheless from time to time grants were obtained for the\r\nconstruction of elongated balloons, for a complete wireless telegraphy\r\nequipment, and, in 1903, for a dirigible balloon. The factory was a\r\nsmall place, but it was full of energy. In 1904 experiments were carried\r\nout with man-lifting kites, with photography from the air, with\r\nsignalling devices, with mechanical apparatus for hauling down the\r\nballoons, and finally with petrol motors. It must always stand to the\r\ncredit of those who were in charge of the factory that when the new era\r\ncame, revolutionizing all the conditions, and when, not many years\r\nlater, the Great War made its sudden and enormous demands, they rose to\r\nthe occasion. Up to May 1906 Colonel Templer was superintendent of the\r\nballoon factory. He was succeeded by Colonel J. E. Capper, who held the\r\nposition till October 1909. During these early years the balloon factory\r\nand balloon school, though nominally separate, were under the same\r\ncontrol. The chief point of difference was that the factory employed\r\nsome civilians, whereas the school was wholly in the hands of the\r\nmilitary. Mr. Haldane decided to separate them, and in 1909 appointed\r\nMr. Mervyn O'Gorman superintendent of the balloon factory, while Colonel\r\nCapper, who was succeeded within a year by Major Sir Alexander\r\nBannerman, Bart., took over the command of the balloon school. Colonel\r\nCapper was a firm believer in the future of the aeroplane, and a true\r\nprophet. In a lecture on military ballooning, delivered at the Royal\r\nUnited Service Institution in 1906, just before he was appointed\r\nsuperintendent of the balloon factory, he concluded with a forecast.\r\n'There is another and far more important phase of aerial locomotion,' he\r\nsaid, 'which in the near future may probably have to be reckoned\r\nwith.... In a few years we may expect to see men moving swiftly through\r\nthe air on simple surfaces, just as a gliding bird moves.... Such\r\nmachines will move very rapidly, probably never less than twenty and up\r\nto a hundred miles per hour; nothing but the heaviest storms will stop\r\nthem. They will be small and difficult to hit, and very difficult to\r\ndamage, and their range of operations will be very large.' Colonel\r\nCapper acted on this belief, and during his time at the factory did what\r\nhe could with meagre funds to encourage aviation. The policy which, in\r\nthe spring of 1908, he recommended to the War Office was to buy any\r\npracticable machines that offered themselves in the market, and at the\r\nsame time not to relax effort at the factory. The attempts of Lieutenant\r\nDunne and Mr. Cody to construct an efficient aeroplane seemed hopeful,\r\nand the factory took them under its wing. Lieutenant Dunne worked at\r\nBlair Atholl from 1907 onward, and Mr. Cody, in the winter of 1907-8,\r\nbegan to construct his machine at Farnborough. In the autumn of 1908 the\r\nHon. C. S. Rolls offered to bring to Farnborough a biplane of the\r\nFarman-Delagrange type, and to experiment with it on behalf of the\r\nGovernment, in return for the necessary shed accommodation. The\r\nacceptance of this proposal had been authorized when an accident to Mr.\r\nCody, caused by want of space, discredited the fitness of the factory\r\nground for aeroplane work, and the arrangement with Mr. Rolls was\r\ndeferred. He renewed his proposal in the spring of 1909, this time with\r\nthe offer of a Wright machine, and he had established himself at\r\nFarnborough, when his death, at the Bournemouth meeting of 1910, cut\r\nshort a career of brilliant promise, for Mr. Rolls was not only one of\r\nthe best of practical aviators, but was alert in all that concerned the\r\nscience of his craft. At the factory the experiments of Mr. Cody and\r\nLieutenant Dunne were supported and continued, but progress was slow and\r\nuncertain, and when, early in 1909, the two machines between them had\r\ninvolved an expense of something like L2,500, further experiments with\r\nthem were abandoned for a time. Their performance did not seem to\r\nwarrant a large national outlay, and the bulk of Colonel Capper's work\r\nwas devoted to what seemed the more promising task of supplying airships\r\nfor the army. The earliest of these had been designed by Colonel\r\nTempler, and two envelopes of gold-beater's skin were ready by 1904, but\r\nthe cost of making them had been so great that further progress on the\r\nship was arrested until 1907. In September of that year the first\r\nBritish army airship, the _Nulli Secundus_, sausage-shaped, about a\r\nhundred and twenty feet long and less than thirty feet in diameter, took\r\nthe air and passed successfully through its trials. It was driven by an\r\nAntoinette engine of from forty to fifty horse-power, and attained a\r\nspeed of about sixteen miles an hour.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of October the ship flew from Farnborough to London, circled\r\nround St. Paul's Cathedral, manoeuvred over the grounds at Buckingham\r\nPalace, and, on her return journey, as she could make no headway against\r\nthe wind, descended in the centre of the cycle-track at the Crystal\r\nPalace, having been in the air for three and a half hours. Five days\r\nlater, to avoid damage by a squall, the ship was deflated, packed up,\r\nand returned to Farnborough by road. Colonel Capper, influenced\r\ndoubtless by the success of the _Lebaudy_ airship in France, decided to\r\nrebuild _Nulli Secundus_ as a semi-rigid, but funds were short, and work\r\ncould not be commenced on her until the following year. In the\r\nreconstruction every possible portion of the original ship was\r\ningeniously utilized. The reconstructed ship was taken out for her first\r\ntrial in the air on the 24th of July 1908. During this flight of four\r\nmiles, lasting eighteen minutes, she suffered various mishaps. After two\r\nmore short flights she was deflated at the end of August, and the career\r\nof the _Nulli Secundus_ was ended. Another smaller and fish-shaped\r\nairship, nicknamed the _Baby_, was put in hand during the autumn of\r\n1908, but was not completed until the following spring. To enable her to\r\ncarry a more powerful engine the _Baby_ was enlarged by cutting the\r\nenvelope in half and introducing a wide belt of gold-beater's skin in\r\nthe middle. Rechristened the _Beta_, she was ready for flight at the end\r\nof May, and on the 3rd of June 1910 made a successful night-flight from\r\nFarnborough to London and back, covering a distance of about seventy\r\nmiles in just over four hours.\r\n\r\nThe output of the factory was small, almost insignificant, compared with\r\nthe efforts being made by foreign nations. Colonel Capper preferred not\r\nto attempt the construction of rigid airships till more was known of\r\nthem. The Zeppelins were the only reputed success, and no Zeppelin, at\r\nthat time, had succeeded in making a forced landing without damage to\r\nthe ship. But the output of the factory is no true measure of the\r\nprogress made. The officers in charge worked with an eye to the future.\r\nEarly in 1906 a proposal was put forward by Brevet Colonel J. D.\r\nFullerton, Royal Engineers, and was warmly supported by Colonel Templer,\r\nfor the appointment of a committee consisting of military officers,\r\naeronauts, mechanical engineers, and naval representatives, to\r\ninvestigate the whole question of aeronautics. A modified form of this\r\nproposal was put forward three years later, in 1909, by Mr. Haldane,\r\nthen Secretary of State for War. He invited Lord Rayleigh and Dr.\r\nRichard Glazebrook, the chairman and the director of the National\r\nPhysical Laboratory, to confer with him, and asked them to prepare for\r\nhis consideration a scheme which should secure the co-operation of the\r\nlaboratory with the services, thus providing scientific inquiry with\r\nopportunities for full-scale experiment. A scheme was drafted; it was\r\ndiscussed and approved at a conference held in the room of the First\r\nLord of the Admiralty, and was submitted to the Prime Minister, Mr.\r\nAsquith, who took action on it, and appointed 'The Advisory Committee\r\nfor 'Aeronautics', under the presidency of Lord Rayleigh. Seven of its\r\nten members were Fellows of the Royal Society. The chairman was Dr.\r\nGlazebrook. The Army was represented by Major-General Sir Charles\r\nHadden, the Navy by Captain R. H. S. Bacon, the Meteorological Office by\r\nDr. W. N. Shaw. The other members were Mr. Horace Darwin, Sir George\r\nGreenhill, Mr. F. W. Lanchester, Mr. H. R. A. Mallock, and Professor J.\r\nE. Petavel. To these, soon after, were added Mr. Mervyn O'Gorman, when\r\nhe took over the charge of the balloon factory, and Captain Murray F.\r\nSueter, R.N., who deserves not a little credit for his early and\r\npersistent efforts to foster aeronautics in the navy. The great value of\r\nthis committee was that it brought together the various bodies concerned\r\nwith aeronautics, and combined their efforts. In particular, it gave to\r\nthe new science the highly skilled services of the National Physical\r\nLaboratory, which organized at Teddington a new department, with\r\nelaborate plant, for the investigation of aeronautical questions. From\r\nthis time onward the National Physical Laboratory worked in the closest\r\nco-operation with the balloon factory. Mathematical and physical\r\ninvestigations were continuously carried on at the laboratory, and\r\nimprovements suggested by these researches were put to the practical\r\ntest at the factory. Questions of air resistance, of the stresses and\r\nstrains on materials, of the best shape for the wing of an aeroplane and\r\nthe best fabric for the envelope of an airship--these and scores of\r\nother problems were systematically and patiently attacked. There were no\r\ntheatrically quick results, but the work done laid a firm and broad base\r\nfor all subsequent success. Hasty popular criticism is apt to measure\r\nthe value of scientific advice by the tale of things done, and to\r\noverlook the credit that belongs to it for things prevented. The science\r\nof aeronautics in the year 1909 was in a very difficult and uncertain\r\nstage of its early development; any mistakes in laying the foundations\r\nof a national air force would not only have involved the nation in much\r\nuseless expense, but would have imperilled the whole structure. Delay\r\nand caution are seldom popular, but they are often wise. Those who are\r\nstung by the accusation of sloth are likely to do something foolish in a\r\nhurry. Nothing is more remarkable in the history of our aeronautical\r\ndevelopment than its comparative freedom from costly mistakes. This\r\nfreedom was attained by a happy conjunction of theory and practice, of\r\nthe laboratory and the factory. The speculative conclusions of the\r\nmerely theoretical man had to undergo the test of action in the rain and\r\nthe wind. The notions and fancies of the merely practical man were\r\nsubjected to the criticism of those who could tell him why he was wrong.\r\nThe rapid growth in power and efficiency of the British air force owed\r\nmuch to the labours of those who befriended it before it was born, and\r\nwho, when it was confronted with the organized science of all the German\r\nuniversities, endowed it with the means of rising to a position of\r\nvantage.\r\n\r\nThe same sort of credit belongs to the conduct of the balloon factory\r\nunder Mr. Mervyn O'Gorman, who had charge of it during that very crucial\r\nperiod from the autumn of 1909 to the summer of 1916. When he took over\r\nthe factory he found at Farnborough one small machine shop, one shed for\r\nmaking balloons, and one airship shed. The workers were about a hundred\r\nin number, fifty men and fifty women. Seven years later, when\r\nLieutenant-Colonel O'Gorman was appointed to the Air Board as consulting\r\nengineer to the Director-General of Military Aeronautics, the hundred\r\nhad swollen to four thousand six hundred, and the buildings situated on\r\nthe forest land of Farnborough had increased and multiplied out of all\r\nrecognition. This development was made necessary by the war, but it\r\nwould have been impossible but for the foresight which directed the\r\noperations of the period before the war. The factory, working in close\r\nco-operation with the Advisory Committee and the National Physical\r\nLaboratory, very early became the chief centre for experimental aviation\r\nwith full-sized machines. Systematic and rapid advance was hardly to be\r\nhoped for from unaided private initiative. Many private makers of\r\nmachines were zealous and public-spirited, but there was no considerable\r\nprivate demand for aeroplanes, and a firm of manufacturers cannot carry\r\non at a loss. Poor though it was in resources, and very meagrely\r\nsupported by Government grants, the factory was what the country had to\r\ndepend on; and it rose to its opportunities.\r\n\r\nAviation, in its early stages, was cramped and harassed by engine\r\nfailure. The improvement of the light engine, in design and\r\nconstruction, was the most pressing of needs; but no sufficiently rapid\r\nimprovement could be hoped for except by the encouragement of private\r\nenterprise. For some years the factory refrained from producing any\r\nofficial engine design, and the superintendent attempted to encourage\r\nthe efforts of private firms. In order to specify the conditions which\r\nmakers must observe, and to apply proper tests to the engines supplied,\r\nit was thought desirable to build an engine laboratory. Accordingly an\r\nengine test plant was devised and installed. It was set in a\r\nwind-tunnel, where by steeply tilting the engine both sideways and\r\nlengthways, in varying currents of air, the actual flying conditions\r\ncould be imitated, and the performance of the engine measured. This\r\nplant for the testing of engines might have been used with valuable\r\nresults, but for one hindrance--the makers of engines were unwilling to\r\nsend them to the factory to be tested, and the plant remained idle.\r\nThere was a misunderstanding, which after a time became acute, between\r\nthe factory and the private makers of aircraft. The factory, zealous for\r\nthe public interest, believed that it could best serve their interest by\r\nencouraging, supervising, and co-ordinating the efforts of the makers.\r\nThe makers, jealous of supervision and control, did not accept that\r\nview. A wise judgement will be slow to blame either. The officials of\r\nthe factory were strong in the knowledge that their work was\r\ndisinterested and aimed only at the public good. The makers, remembering\r\nthat progress in aviation had come chiefly by way of private enterprise,\r\nfeared the paralysing effect of official control, and the habitual\r\ntendency of officials, especially of competent officials, to extend\r\ntheir ambitions and their powers. The makers, in short, dreaded a\r\nGovernment monopoly. A difference of this kind, even when it is gently\r\nand considerately handled, always furnishes a happy hunting-ground for\r\nthe political agitator and the grievance-monger. The thing came to a\r\nhead during the war, when the success of the Fokkers, which reached its\r\nheight during the early months of 1916, made the public uneasy. The\r\nFokkers late in 1915 had been fitted with guns which fired through the\r\nairscrew. This was the secret of their success, which was short-lived,\r\nbut was made the occasion, in Parliament and elsewhere, for a long array\r\nof charges against the administration and command of the Royal Flying\r\nCorps. A parliamentary committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice\r\nBailhache, was appointed to investigate these charges. Their report\r\nvindicated the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Aircraft Factory, and\r\nexpressed admiration for the work done by both under the stress and\r\nstrain of war. The charges, it should be added, were not supported by\r\nthe private makers, or 'the trade', as they are called; none of them\r\nmade any complaint, and some of them went out of their way to record\r\ntheir gratitude for the help they had received from the factory.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the uncertainty of its relations with the trade caused the\r\nfactory, in its early days, to undertake a great diversity of business.\r\nThe designing of aircraft was plainly a matter of the first importance,\r\nand for this designing it was necessary to collect a trained staff. The\r\ndifficulty here was that there were no professional designers; the\r\naeronautical world was a strange ferment of inventors, amateurs,\r\nenthusiasts, heretics of all sorts, wedded to their own notions, and\r\nmutually hostile. The factory decided to employ only those designers who\r\nhad had a solid course of training in engineering shops. By degrees\r\nengineers trained in shipyards and officers skilled in motor-car design\r\nwere added to the staff of the drawing office until, by 1916, it had\r\nincreased from some half-dozen to two hundred and seventy-five.\r\n\r\nWhen the war came this drawing office proved its value. An immense\r\nnumber of aeroplanes was required, and many firms had to be employed to\r\nmake them. Some of these firms were well staffed, others not so well.\r\nThe factory made elaborate detailed dimensioned drawings, marked with\r\nevery permitted kind and degree of variation--as many as four hundred\r\ndrawings to a single aeroplane. With the help of these drawings all\r\nkinds of firms--organ-builders, makers of furniture, or pianos, or\r\ngramophones, or motor-cars--could be turned on to aeroplane manufacture.\r\nIn the course of two years half a million drawings were issued to\r\nvarious firms; and those firms to whom the whole business of engineering\r\nwas strange were successfully initiated in one of its most delicate and\r\ndifficult branches. Here, too, the outcry was raised, in the newspapers\r\nand in Parliament, that the factory was attempting to make a Government\r\nmonopoly of aircraft design and air-engine design. The accusation was\r\ndisproved; it would probably never have been made but for the admirable\r\nefficiency of the factory in rising to meet a national crisis. National\r\ndefence, it is agreed, cannot safely be left wholly to private\r\nenterprise, even in England. The factory carried out an immense number\r\nof experiments in connexion with aeroplanes and airships. The quest for\r\nstability, longitudinal and lateral, in aeroplanes was the chief\r\npreoccupation of these early years. Powerful engines are useless in a\r\nship which cannot be trusted to keep afloat. It was this quest, as much\r\nas anything, which drew the factory into designing aeroplanes. The\r\nvarious types of aeroplane designed at the factory bear names which\r\nconsist of a pair of initial letters, with a number affixed. The letters\r\nindicate the type of the machine; the number indicates its place in the\r\nseries of continually improving variants of the same type. Three of\r\nthese types were gradually being evolved at the factory in the course of\r\nthe year 1911. The earliest to attain to practical success was the B.E.\r\ntype of machine. Every pilot who had his training in the early days of\r\nthe war was familiar with this machine, though not every pilot knew that\r\nthe initials are a monument to Louis Bleriot, who first flew the\r\nChannel. His achievement gave a great vogue to his monoplane, which was\r\nimitated by many designers; and when the factory produced a biplane\r\nfitted, like all monoplanes, with a tractor airscrew, in front of the\r\nmachine, the biplane was called the Bleriot Experimental. The F.E. type\r\nis the Farman Experimental, a pusher biplane, which for a long time held\r\nits own by virtue of two advantages. The observer, being seated in the\r\nvery prow of the machine, could fire a gun forward without being\r\nobstructed by the airscrew. This advantage disappeared after 1915, when,\r\nby the invention of synchronizing gears, which timed the bullets to pass\r\nbetween the revolving blades of the screw, tractor machines were\r\nenabled to fire directly ahead. But another advantage persisted. In\r\nnight-flying, when the eyes are strained to pick up dim shapes in the\r\ndark, a clear field of vision is all-important, and the F.E. type of\r\nmachine continued to be used in night raids throughout the war. The\r\nthird type was the S.E., or Scouting Experimental. The fifth variant of\r\nthis type, the S.E. 5, gained an enormous reputation in the war as a\r\nfighting machine, and indeed was preferred by some pilots to the best\r\nscout machines of private makers.\r\n\r\nA fourth factory machine, produced just before the war, and no less\r\nfamous than the other three, was called the R.E., or Reconnaissance\r\nExperimental. It was the first almost completely stable machine.\r\nStability is not of the first importance to a fighting scout, whose\r\nattention is concentrated on his own manoeuvres, but where a machine is\r\nused for observation, and the pilot must needs pay heed to all that is\r\nvisible on the earth beneath, stability is essential. A perfectly stable\r\nmachine maintains an even keel in varying gusts of wind. If it is\r\ntilted, it rights itself. If it is nose-dived, the pilot has only to let\r\ngo of the control, and after a descent of some hundreds of feet it comes\r\nout of the dive and resumes its horizontal flight. The perfecting of\r\nthis type of machine was achieved at the factory, and was the work of\r\nmany minds. On the mathematical side the theory of stability was\r\ninvestigated by Mr. F. W. Lanchester, an authority on the theory of\r\nflight, and by Professor G. H. Bryan, a great pioneer, who in 1911\r\nproduced his book on _Stability in Aviation_. He had long been\r\ninterested in the subject; his work, which is recognized as\r\nepoch-making, laid a sound mathematical basis for the theory of flight,\r\nand directed the work of others along the lines of fruitful experiment.\r\nThe theoretical conclusions of Professor Bryan were reduced to a\r\npractical form by Mr. Leonard Bairstow and the members of the staff of\r\nthe National Physical Laboratory, who put the doctrine to the proof of\r\nexperiment, at first with models, and then with full-scale machines. The\r\ndangerous work of trying conclusions with the air fell to the young men\r\nof the factory. A brilliant young Cambridge man, Mr. E. T. Busk, of\r\nKing's College, who had been trained in the laboratory of Professor\r\nBertram Hopkinson, joined the staff of the factory in the summer of\r\n1912, having previously spent a month at the National Physical\r\nLaboratory, to acquaint himself with the work there. He understood the\r\ntheoretical basis of aeroplane design, and he was a daring and skilful\r\npilot. The R.E. machine was designed by the staff of the factory; Mr.\r\nBusk, in collaboration with Mr. Bairstow, worked at the problem of\r\ngiving it stability. He cheerfully took all risks in trying the\r\nfull-sized machines in the air. When the R.E. 1 had been theoretically\r\nwarranted, by experiments with models, to right herself after a\r\nnose-dive, he tested the theory by flying the machine to a great height,\r\nturning her nose down and letting go the controls. As he expected, she\r\nrighted. To test the machine he flew her in all weathers, hurling her\r\nagainst the wind storms. For the purposes of these practical tests he\r\ninvented an instrument of his own called the Ripograph, which recorded\r\non a single strip all the pilot's movements in warping and steering, as\r\nwell as the speed, inclination, and roll of the machine. This machine,\r\nwhen the rudder was turned right or left, automatically banked itself;\r\nand when the engine was cut off, took the angle of gliding flight. It\r\nwas a later variant of the same machine, an R.E. 8 belonging to the\r\nAustralian Flying Corps, of which it is told that, when the pilot and\r\nobserver had both been shot dead, in December 1917, the machine\r\ncontinued to fly in wide left-hand circles, and ultimately, when the\r\nfuel was exhausted and the engine stopped, fell near St.-Pol, some\r\nthirty miles from the scene of combat, without completely wrecking\r\nitself. When the war broke out Mr. Busk was more than ever needed at the\r\nfactory. On the 5th of November 1914 he mounted in an experimental B.E.\r\n2c machine to a height of about eight hundred feet. Exactly what\r\nhappened will never be known; the petrol vapour must have been ignited\r\nby a spark; the machine burst into flames, and after drifting aimlessly\r\nfor a time, fell on Laffan's Plain. The death of such men as Charles\r\nRolls and Edward Busk was a part of the heavy price that had to be paid\r\nfor victory; before victory was in sight. There was no other way; the\r\nwork that they did could not be spared, and could never have been even\r\nattempted except by the quiet of absolute courage.\r\n\r\nThe business undertaken by the factory, apart from its main business of\r\nresearch and experiment, was almost bewildering in its diversity. From\r\nthe first the officials of the factory insisted on maintaining a high\r\nstandard of workmanship, which spells safety in the air. This question\r\nof workmanship became doubly important during the war, when, in order to\r\nimprove the performance of machines, all avoidable weight had to be\r\nsacrificed, and the factor of safety, as it is called, reduced to the\r\nlowest permissible limit. The breaking of a spar or a wire, the failure\r\nof a bolt or a nut, may mean a fatal accident. Further, the factory did\r\nwhat it could to standardize the component parts of an aeroplane, so as\r\nto facilitate repair; and this, before the war came, had been largely\r\nachieved. It designed and fitted up the instruments necessary for the\r\npilot's use, which record for him his speed through the air, the\r\nconsumption of his fuel, the rate of revolutions of his airscrew, the\r\nheight attained, and other essentials. The average pilot, it is well\r\nknown, is supplied with more instruments than he uses, but it is true\r\nnevertheless that familiarity with the use of instruments has often\r\nstaved off disasters. At first the factory had refrained from initiating\r\nengine designs, but when competition and trial had shown that there was\r\nno immediate prospect of obtaining a thoroughly satisfactory engine from\r\nEnglish makers, it asked permission of the War Office, and in 1913\r\ndesigned its own engine. Among its notable devices one or two may be\r\nmentioned. The mooring-mast for airships, to which they can be tethered\r\nin the open, was invented at the factory, and developed independently\r\nfor naval work, by the Admiralty. The fair-shaped wires and struts, to\r\ndecrease air resistance, were a great improvement. These parts of an\r\naeroplane offer so considerable a resistance to its passage through the\r\nair, that when their transverse section, instead of being round, is\r\nstreamlined, the speed of the machine is increased by several miles an\r\nhour. In short, during those early years the factory, which directly or\r\nindirectly had to supply most of the requirements of the balloon school,\r\nthe Air Battalion, and the Royal Flying Corps, combined in itself all\r\nthe functions of what later on were highly organized separate Government\r\ndepartments--inspection, stores, repairs, the testing of inventions, and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it will be seen that the factory continued, as\r\nit began, in close relations with the army. It had been founded, under\r\narmy auspices, at an important inland military centre, and it was not so\r\nwell adapted, by its history or situation, to serve the navy. The\r\nresults obtained by research at the National Physical Laboratory, and by\r\nexperiment at the factory, furthered the science of aviation, and were\r\nopen to all. But when flight began, a united national air force was not\r\nthought of by any one, or was thought of only in dreams. Meantime the\r\nnew invention offered to the navy, no less than to the army, new\r\nopportunities of increasing the power of its own weapon. The problems of\r\nthe navy were not the problems of the army, and a certain\r\nself-protective jealousy made the two forces keep apart, so that each\r\nmight develop unhampered by alien control. The navy trusted more to\r\nprivate firms, and less to the factory. It was a difference of tendency\r\nrather than a clean-cut difference of policy. Both army and navy made\r\nuse of the results obtained at the laboratory and the factory. The army\r\nemployed many private makers for the supply of machines and engines, and\r\nthe navy, in the course of the war, ordered a very large number of that\r\nmost famous of factory machines--the B.E. 2c. But the navy stood as far\r\naloof from the factory as possible, and looked mainly to private firms\r\nnot only for the supply of machines and engines, but for much of its\r\nexperimental work. Several of the firms who devoted themselves to the\r\nneeds of naval aviation did excellent service as pioneers. The most\r\ndistinguished of these was the firm of the Short brothers--that is, of\r\nMessrs. Oswald, Eustace, and Horace Short. The impulse of their work was\r\nscientific, not commercial. As early as 1897 Mr. Eustace Short was an\r\namateur balloonist, and his younger brother Oswald, at the age of\r\nfifteen, began to accompany him on his voyages. In a public library they\r\ncame across that celebrated record of balloon voyages, _Travels in the\r\nAir_, by James Glaisher, and made up their minds to construct a balloon\r\nof their own. Success led them on step by step; in 1905 they contracted\r\nto supply captive war balloons for the Government of India, and in 1906\r\nthey became the club engineers of the newly formed Royal Aero Club. The\r\nreported successes of the Wright brothers in America shifted the\r\ninterest of the club, and of the club engineers, from balloons to\r\nflying machines; in 1908 they built their first glider--a complete\r\nminiature Wright machine, without the power plant--for the Hon. C. S.\r\nRolls. At about this time they were joined by the eldest of the three\r\nbrothers, Mr. Horace Short, an accomplished man of science and a lover\r\nof adventure; from this time onward the firm of the Short brothers never\r\nlooked back. From sketches made by Mr. Horace Short, they built six\r\nbiplanes to the order of the Wrights. They constructed, in 1909, the\r\naeroplane on which Mr. J. T. C. Moore-Brabazon won the prize offered by\r\nthe _Daily Mail_ for the first all-British machine which should fly a\r\ncircular mile. They made the outer cover, gas-bags, valves,\r\npressure-gauges, and controlling rudders for the first rigid airship\r\nconstructed to the order of the Admiralty. Their early work was done at\r\nShellness, the flying centre for members of the Royal Aero Club, but in\r\n1909 they moved their sheds to Eastchurch in the Isle of Sheppey, which\r\nthereafter became the flying centre of the navy. It was here that the\r\nfirst four naval aviators were taught to fly. The tale of the successes\r\nof the various Short machines would make something not unlike a complete\r\nhistory of early naval aviation. The first landing on the water by an\r\naeroplane fitted with airbags, the first flight from the deck of a ship,\r\nthe first flight up the Thames, not to mention many other incidents in\r\nthe progress of record-making, must all be credited to the Short\r\nfactory. The brothers held that the right way to advance aviation was to\r\nstrengthen the resources of the aeroplane-designing firms, so that they\r\nmight carry out their ideas without being dependent on Government\r\ndemands, and the extraordinary success of the Short designs for\r\naeroplanes and seaplanes did much to promote that creed.\r\n\r\nAt the factory the work with airships was continued, though it\r\nlanguished somewhat as interest in aviation grew. England had shown the\r\nway in the use of gold-beater's skin, which is greatly superior in\r\nendurance and impermeability to any other fabric, but the knowledge\r\nleaked through to Germany, and when the price of the skin, always high,\r\nsuddenly rose higher from heavy German buying, England fell back on\r\nrubbered cotton. The _Baby_, altered and enlarged, was rechristened the\r\n_Beta_, and a new ship, called the _Gamma_, made of rubbered fabric, was\r\nadded in 1910. The _Gamma_, though twice reconstructed and altered, was\r\nnever satisfactory. In 1912 _Beta_ No. 2, built in streamline shape,\r\nabout a hundred feet long, stiffened at the nose with ribs like\r\numbrella-ribs, and driven by a forty-five horse-power Clerget engine,\r\nwas more of a success. Other airships, the _Delta_ and _Epsilon_, of\r\nincreased size and engine-power, were designed between 1911 and 1913. In\r\nthis latter year the Air Committee, a body appointed in 1912 by the\r\nCommittee of Imperial Defence, advised that the navy, that is to say,\r\nthe Naval Wing of the newly-formed Royal Flying Corps, should take over\r\nthe development of all lighter-than-air craft. This advice, which was\r\ncarried into effect by the end of the year, put an end to military\r\nexperiments with airships, and supplied the navy with the nucleus of\r\nthat airship force which during the war did so much good service, in\r\nconvoy, in scouting for submarines, and in patrolling the coast and the\r\nEnglish Channel.\r\n\r\nThe earliest experiments undertaken by the Admiralty with craft lighter\r\nthan air had been ambitious and unfortunate. It was always recognized by\r\nthose who gave thought to aeronautics that for naval purposes the\r\nairship has some advantages over the aeroplane. It can remain longer in\r\nthe air, so that its range of action is greater; it can easily carry\r\nwireless apparatus both for transmitting and for receiving; it can take\r\nup a stationary point of vantage where the aeroplane must needs keep\r\nmoving; it can lift a greater weight; and (not least important) it can\r\nenormously add to the efficiency of the observer by supplying him with\r\ncomfortable and habitable quarters. These things did not escape the\r\nattention of the small and enthusiastic band of naval officers who from\r\nthe first were believers in the air. Their ideas took shape in proposals\r\nwhich were submitted by the Director of Naval Ordnance (Captain Bacon)\r\nto the First Sea Lord (Lord Fisher) on the 21st of July 1908. What was\r\nproposed, in effect, was that Messrs. Vickers, Son & Maxim, who had been\r\nso successful in the design and manufacture of submarines, should be\r\nasked to undertake the construction of a large rigid airship of the\r\nZeppelin type. After many meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence,\r\nat which Captain Bacon propounded his views with great vigour, the\r\ncommittee recommended that the sum of L35,000 should be placed in the\r\nNavy Estimates for 1909-10, for the construction of an airship to be\r\ndesigned and built under Admiralty supervision. The Treasury agreed, and\r\nMessrs. Vickers's tender for the airship was accepted on the 7th of May\r\n1909. The huge Cavendish Dock at Barrow-in-Furness was appropriated to\r\nthe work, and the greatest possible secrecy was observed in all the\r\npreparations. A special section was formed to assist in the construction\r\nof the ship--Captain Murray F. Sueter, R.N., and, with him, Lieutenant\r\nNeville Usborne, Lieutenant C. P. Talbot, and Chief Artificer Engineer\r\nA. Sharpe. For two years public curiosity was kept alive on a diet of\r\nconjecture. A good part of this time was taken up in improvements and\r\nmodifications of the design of the ship. When at last in May 1911 the\r\nshed was opened and the huge airship was brought out to her mooring-mast\r\nin the dock, those who had expected a larger and better Zeppelin seemed\r\njustified in their belief. The ship was 512 feet long and 48 feet in\r\ndiameter, with a blunt bow and a pointed stern. Her capacity was\r\napproximately 700,000 cubic feet. The framework was made of a new alloy\r\ncalled 'duralumin', nearly as strong in tension as mild steel and not\r\nmuch heavier than aluminium. It was covered with 46,000 square yards of\r\nwater-tight silk fabric, so treated with aluminium dust and rubber that\r\nthe upper surface of the hull, which had to resist the rays of the sun,\r\nshowed the silver sheen of a fish, while the lower surface, which had to\r\nresist the damp vapours of the water, was of a dull yellowish colour.\r\nThe hydrogen was contained in seventeen gas-bags of rubbered fabric. The\r\nship was fitted with two Wolseley motors of one hundred and eighty\r\nhorse-power each, and with a whole series of vertical and horizontal\r\nrudders. She was popularly called the _Mayfly_--a name which, both in\r\nand out of Parliament, suggested to bright wits an ill-omened pun.\r\n\r\nShe never flew. For four days she remained tethered to the mooring-mast\r\nin the centre of the Cavendish Dock, and successfully completed her\r\nmooring trials. During this time the wind was rough, reaching in gusts a\r\nvelocity of forty-five miles an hour. This wind, being a severer test\r\nthan any previous airship had successfully encountered when moored in\r\nthe open, proved the strength of the ship. But her very strength, and\r\nthe completeness of her fittings, told against her in another way; the\r\nlift of an airship, consisting as it does of a small excess of buoyancy\r\nover weight, is always a matter of the most delicate and difficult\r\ncalculation, and her lift proved to be insufficient. She was taken back\r\ninto her shed, without mishap, and alterations were at once put in hand.\r\nOn the 24th of September 1911 she was again drawn out of her shed to be\r\ntransferred to the mooring-post; in the process she broke her back, and\r\nbecame a total wreck. The ensuing court of inquiry pronounced that the\r\naccident was due to structural weakness; the naval officers and men\r\nwere exonerated from all blame.\r\n\r\nThis accident had a far-reaching effect. It disappointed public hopes\r\nand strengthened the case of objectors. There are always critics who\r\ntake a certain mild pleasure in failure, not because they prefer it to\r\nsuccess, but because they have predicted it. The pioneers of aeronautics\r\ncould not afford to lose friends; they had none too many. The men in\r\nhigh authority at the Admiralty were not convinced that airships were a\r\ndesirable and practicable addition to naval resources. They would all\r\nhave died to save England, but they held that she was to be saved in the\r\nold way, on the sea. One gallant and distinguished admiral, when he\r\nfirst saw the _Mayfly_, said, 'It is the work of a lunatic'. The\r\nconsequences of the failure were soon apparent. The president of the\r\ncourt of inquiry recommended to the First Sea Lord (Sir A. K. Wilson)\r\nthat the policy of naval airship construction should, for the time, be\r\nabandoned. At a conference held on the 25th of January 1912, in the\r\nFirst Sea Lord's room at the Admiralty, it was decided, in accordance\r\nwith this recommendation, that the airship experiments should be\r\ndiscontinued. Moreover, the special section, the nucleus of a naval air\r\nservice, was, by the decision of the Admiralty, broken up, and Captain\r\nSueter and his officers were returned to general service. When the\r\nconstruction of rigid airships was at last taken up again early in 1914,\r\nthey were too late for the market; the heavy demands of the war delayed\r\ntheir completion, and no British rigid airship was in use at the time of\r\nthe battle of Jutland.\r\n\r\nIt is to the credit of the pioneers of the Naval Air Service that when\r\nthey were faced with this disaster, after years of fruitless effort,\r\nthey did not lose heart or hope, but held on their course. Time was on\r\ntheir side. In the later autumn of 1911 the Committee of Imperial\r\nDefence, as shall be explained in the next chapter, appointed a\r\ntechnical sub-committee to give advice on the measures which should be\r\ntaken to secure for the country an efficient aerial service. On the 5th\r\nof February 1912 Captain Sueter gave evidence to this body of experts,\r\nand sketched in broad outline his ideas for the development of a naval\r\nair service. Airships and aeroplanes, he said, were both required, and\r\nneither of them should be developed at the expense of the other. An\r\nairship had the great advantage that she could carry long-distance\r\nwireless apparatus, and could send or receive a message over a space of\r\nthree hundred miles. She could stop her engines and drift over suspected\r\nplaces, for the detection of submarines and mines. The seaplane, he\r\nmaintained, should also be developed, and he saw no insuperable\r\ndifficulties in devising a machine that should be able to alight on\r\neither water or land and to rise again into the air from either. 'I\r\nthink you have got a certain amount of intellect', he said, 'in the Navy\r\nto do it, and I think you have got a certain amount of intellect in the\r\nArmy to do it. The two together, with the Advisory Committee--there are\r\ntalented people there--and the manufacturers in the country; between us\r\nall we could devise something. We did not have great difficulty with the\r\nsubmarine boats; and that was all new at first.' The problem of the air,\r\nhe held, was vital for the Navy; and when he was asked whether we must\r\ntry to command the air as well as the sea, he replied, 'I think it will\r\ncome to that. I do not say that we wish to do so, but I think we will be\r\nforced to do so.' In a memorandum submitted to the same sub-committee by\r\nCaptain Bertram Dickson the meaning of the command of the air is more\r\nfully explained. 'In the case of a European war', he writes, between two\r\ncountries, both sides would be equipped with large corps of aeroplanes,\r\neach trying to obtain information of the other, and to hide its own\r\nmovements. The efforts which each would exert in order to hinder or\r\nprevent the enemy from obtaining information ... would lead to the\r\ninevitable result of a war in the air, for the supremacy of the air, by\r\narmed aeroplanes against each other. _This fight for the supremacy of\r\nthe air in future wars will be of the first and greatest importance_,\r\nand when it has been won the land and sea forces of the loser will be at\r\nsuch a disadvantage that the war will certainly have to terminate at a\r\nmuch smaller loss in men and money to both sides.'\r\n\r\nThe whole matter is clearly stated in these passages. The people of\r\nGreat Britain live in an island. They do not desire--they have never\r\ndesired--to dominate the world, or to dictate to other peoples how they\r\nshall live. They do desire to be free of the world, and to take their\r\nluck in it, passing to and fro without hindrance. This freedom of theirs\r\nhas repeatedly been imperilled by foreign powers, who have always\r\ndesired a greater degree of uniformity and control than is tolerable to\r\nBritain. In order to keep their doors open the people of this island\r\nhave been compelled to fight at sea, and have attained a measure of\r\nnaval power which is sometimes called the mastery of the seas, but\r\nwhich, in essence, is no more than the obstinate and resolute assertion\r\nof their right to be the masters of themselves. They have been\r\nadventurers and pirates; they have never been tyrants. They fight\r\ndesperately because they know that even on distant seas they are\r\nfighting for their lives, and for all that makes their lives worth\r\nliving. Their many victories, under which they groan, have compelled\r\nthem to learn the imperial art, an art which they practise not without\r\nskill, but reluctantly, and without zest. With the conquest of the air\r\ntheir task of self-defence has been doubled. It is not to be wondered at\r\nthat those who were responsible for keeping open the gates of the sea\r\nshould turn their eyes away from the new duty. But the new duty--command\r\nof the air, so to call it--was plainly visible to those who once looked\r\nat it. We must keep the highways open, or our freedom is gone. We must\r\ncommand the air. 'I do not say that we wish to do so,' said Captain\r\nSueter, 'but I think we shall be forced to do so.' The whole of our\r\nnaval history is summed up in that sentence; and the whole of our air\r\npolicy is foretold.\r\n\r\nThe force that was to compel us was already in being. The science of\r\naeronautics had passed from the experimental to the practical stage, and\r\nforeign powers were rapidly building up very formidable air forces. Of\r\nthese foreign forces we naturally knew most of the French, for France\r\nwas both our neighbour and our friend. In October 1911 a very full and\r\nilluminative report was supplied to the Government by Lieutenant Ralph\r\nGlyn, an officer attached to the newly-formed Air Battalion. It\r\ndescribed, with reasoned comments, the aeronautical exercises carried\r\nout by the French air corps at the Camp de Chalons during the previous\r\nAugust. At that time the French War Ministry had at its disposal, so far\r\nas could be ascertained, something between two hundred and two hundred\r\nand twenty aeroplanes. The biplanes were all Farmans. The monoplanes,\r\nwhich were on the whole preferred by expert opinion to the biplanes,\r\nwere of many types, all famous for achievement--Nieuports, Bleriots,\r\nDeperdussins, R.E.P.'s, Antoinettes, and others. The methods of training\r\nwere elaborate and complete, and the air corps were continually\r\npractised in co-operation with all other arms--infantry, cavalry, and\r\nartillery. 'There is no doubt at all', says the writer, 'but that the\r\nGermans have suddenly realized that the French Army since the general\r\nemployment of aeroplanes with troops has improved its fighting\r\nefficiency by at least twenty per cent.... For the last five years the\r\nGermans have concentrated their whole attention upon the building,\r\nmanoeuvring, and employment with troops, of dirigibles. They have gained\r\na slight advance over France, in fact, in this branch of aeronautics;\r\nbut they have quite dropped behind in the question of heavier-than-air\r\nmachines. France now after an equal period has just, and only just,\r\nformed a really efficient fighting aerial corps; and this lead of five\r\nyears she is determined to maintain.'\r\n\r\nThis is not an over-statement. From the first the French, who had\r\nthought out the whole business, laid great stress on reconnaissance and\r\ncontrol of artillery fire as the main uses of aircraft. For\r\nreconnaissance the aeroplanes were practised to co-operate with cavalry.\r\nFor fire control official maps, divided into geometrical squares, so\r\nthat a pair of numbers will identify a position within a score or so of\r\nyards, were supplied in duplicate to the pilots of the aeroplanes and to\r\nthe commanding officers of batteries. The system of signalling employed\r\nwas mostly primitive, but already in 1911 the French were experimenting\r\nwith captive balloons which received the messages from the aeroplane,\r\nand by wireless, or some kind of visible signal, transmitted them to the\r\nguns. 'Practice', says Lieutenant Glyn, 'has made almost perfect a\r\nremarkable system which renders the efficient French artillery more\r\nformidable than ever.' Further, infantry were trained to co-operate with\r\naircraft, so as to learn to take advantage of the new arm; and aerial\r\nphotography was practised, under strict conditions of secrecy, with a\r\nsurprising degree of success. In short, almost all the uses which later\r\nbecame the commonplaces of the war were exemplified in the French\r\nmanoeuvres of 1911. Battle in the air and the use of aircraft as a\r\nweapon of direct offence were later developments.\r\n\r\nIn October and November of the same year Captain F. H. Sykes, of the\r\nGeneral Staff, and Captain J. D. B. Fulton, of the Air Battalion,\r\nvisited many of the French military and civil aerodromes, and were\r\npresent at the military aeroplane competition at Rheims. 'The trials\r\nheld at Rheims', says Captain Sykes, 'are considerably in advance of\r\nanything yet attempted.' The machines were flown by the best available\r\npilots, and were under the personal supervision of the makers and\r\ndesigners. Aerodromes were better and more numerous than in England;\r\nmany of them were situated in wide plains, so that the learner could\r\nmake his first cross-country flights over good even landing ground.\r\nCaptain Sykes, in his report, suggests that aeroplane sheds should be\r\nerected and flying schools started at stations not very far apart from\r\none another in England, so that cross-country training may be\r\nfacilitated. 'These stations should be as near as possible', he adds,\r\n'to where troops are quartered, so as to afford an opportunity for\r\naeroplanes to work with troops on field days. The cost would, I think,\r\nbe inconsiderable in comparison to the value gained.' This suggestion\r\nwas carried out, but not until the war had compelled an immense\r\nexpansion of the air force.\r\n\r\nThe French, then, were ahead of us, and were showing us the way. Of\r\nGerman preparations less was known, and estimates of the German air\r\nforce, even when made by experts, were largely guesswork. The Zeppelin\r\nairships enjoyed a world-wide fame, and there is good reason to think\r\nthat the German Government practised a certain measure of frankness with\r\nregard to their airship establishment in order the more effectively to\r\nshroud the very resolute effort they were making to overtake the French\r\nin the production of aeroplanes. If ever they thought that the airship\r\nalone would do their business, that dream soon passed away. A good deal\r\nof valuable information concerning the German air force was obtained in\r\nthe summer of 1912, just after the formation of the Royal Flying Corps.\r\nIn June of that year the Technical Sub-committee of the Committee of\r\nImperial Defence (a body whose cumbrous name does no justice to its\r\nswift decisions) dispatched two of its members, Captain Sueter and Mr.\r\nO'Gorman, to France, Austria, and Germany, to report, primarily, on the\r\nwhole airship question. In Germany these delegates took occasion to\r\nvisit five aeroplane factories--the Rumpler, Etrich, Albatross, Harland,\r\nand Fokker, besides inspecting various flying grounds and wireless\r\nstations. Their report is full of interest. 'No year passes', they\r\nremark, 'in which orders equal to our total equipment are not placed by\r\nGermany, France, and Italy.' In Germany they found there were thirty\r\nairships available, and a large Government factory for rigids 'only\r\nthinly pretending to be a private speculation'. They append a list of no\r\nfewer than twenty-eight military flying grounds at which there were\r\nflying camps. They were deeply impressed by the evidence of large\r\nexpenditure, direct and indirect, on aerial preparation, and the\r\nsystematic manner of that expenditure. 'The position of Germany', they\r\nsay, 'appeared to us to be widely different from what it is described in\r\nthe English press ... and far more active.' During their trip in the\r\nZeppelin airship _Viktoria Luise_ they were struck with the fervour of\r\npopular enthusiasm. 'On passing over villages, isolated farms, &c.,\r\neverybody turned out and cheered and waved.' This popular enthusiasm was\r\nfurther demonstrated by the substantial evidence of large subscriptions\r\nfrom municipal bodies and private persons. Everywhere they found reason\r\nto suspect a certain amount of concealed Government support and subsidy\r\nunderlying ostensibly private ventures.\r\n\r\nThis report was presented in July 1912. The technical sub-committee, at\r\na later date, drew some further lessons from it. 'The report', they\r\nsay, 'shows that German airships have, by repeated voyages, proved their\r\nability to reconnoitre the whole of the German coastline on the North\r\nSea. In any future war with Germany, except in foggy or stormy weather,\r\nit is probable that no British war vessels or torpedo craft will be able\r\nto approach within many miles of the German coast without their presence\r\nbeing discovered and reported to the enemy. Unless we had obtained\r\ncommand of the air, any idea that our torpedo craft could seek shelter\r\namong the Frisian Islands and remain there undetected must be\r\nabandoned.... The report also shows that German airships have covered a\r\ndistance equal to the distance from Germany to the British coast without\r\nreplenishing fuel.... In favourable weather the German airships can\r\nalready be employed for reconnaissance over vast areas of the North Sea,\r\nand one airship, owing to the extended view from high altitudes under\r\nfavourable weather conditions, is able to accomplish the work of a large\r\nnumber of scouting cruisers. It is difficult to exaggerate the value of\r\nthis advantage to Germany. By a systematic and regular patrol of the\r\napproaches to the coast, it will be possible in fair weather for German\r\nairships to discover the approach of an enemy and to give timely warning\r\nof attack, and if the approaches are reported free from the enemy the\r\ndefenders of the ports and the crews of ships in these ports will be\r\nrelieved for many hours from the intense and harassing strain caused by\r\nuncertainty as to the probability of attack.' Further, the sub-committee\r\npoint out that the great continental airships, which can easily carry\r\nthirty persons, can certainly carry a sufficient weight of bombs to\r\ndestroy torpedo-craft, dock gates, power stations, magazines, and the\r\nlike; and that they are far less dependent on favourable weather than is\r\ngenerally supposed. 'In short, every one of the strategical and\r\ntactical advantages which the Committee of Imperial Defence anticipated\r\nin 1909 when recommending the construction of a rigid airship for the\r\nNavy, has been, or is in a fair way of being, realized by the German\r\nairships. These results have only been attained by perseverance under\r\nthe most discouraging conditions of disaster and loss.'\r\n\r\nThe total air force possessed by Great Britain, to set over against\r\nthese great foreign organizations, consisted of two small army airships,\r\nnamed _Beta_ and _Gamma_, and a very small number of aeroplanes.\r\n\r\nThe report of Captain Sueter and Mr. O'Gorman put the whole matter in a\r\nnew light, and showed the need for action. In regard to aeroplanes, this\r\naction had already been taken. In the winter of 1911-12 the\r\nsub-committee had recommended the formation of a corps of aviators; and\r\nthis recommendation, as shall be told in the next chapter, had been\r\npromptly carried into effect. As for airships, which chiefly concerned\r\nthe navy, the question was now not whether the Admiralty were willing to\r\ntake up experimental work with a newfangled invention, but whether they\r\ncould afford to neglect a weapon of certain value, which might prove to\r\nbe a determining factor in war. Airships of the largest size and power\r\nmust be provided, said the sub-committee, in the near future. But to\r\nbuild these airships at once, they were agreed, would be to court\r\ndisaster. A large airship is of little use to men who have had no\r\ntraining in the handling and navigation of airships. Such experience as\r\nwas available was to be found at the Royal Aircraft Factory, which had\r\nproduced and flown airships for military purposes. The Admiralty\r\nresponded at once; in September 1912 the naval airship section, which\r\nhad been disbanded earlier in the year, was reconstituted, and Commander\r\nE. A. D. Masterman, Lieutenants N. F. Usborne, F. L. M. Boothby, and H.\r\nL. Woodcock, and a small number of ratings were attached to the airship\r\nsquadron of the Military Wing at Farnborough, to gain experience of work\r\nwith airships. The airships themselves were to be supplied from various\r\nsources. The factory was to build a new airship of the _Gamma_ type. A\r\nsmall Willows airship, which happened to be on the market, though it had\r\nno military value, was held to be worth its cost for training purposes.\r\nThe sub-committee also recommended the purchase of two foreign airships.\r\nHere there were difficulties. The best airships of Germany were the\r\nrigid Zeppelin and the semi-rigid Parseval. The Zeppelin Company was\r\nforbidden by the German Government to sell its ships to foreigners; but\r\nnegotiations for the purchase of a Parseval airship were successful. An\r\nAstra-Torres non-rigid airship of about 400,000 cubic feet of capacity\r\nwas acquired from France in the course of the year 1913. In July of the\r\nsame year Mr. Winston Churchill, the then First Lord of the Admiralty,\r\nwho regularly gave his strong support to naval aeronautics, approved of\r\nthe construction of two rigid airships and six non-rigid airships.\r\nTreasury sanction was obtained for this programme. The rigid airships\r\nwere to be built by Messrs. Vickers at Barrow-in-Furness. Of the six\r\nnon-rigids, three were to be of the Parseval type, and three of the\r\nForlanini type. One of the Parsevals was to be built in Germany, and two\r\nby Messrs. Vickers, who had succeeded in obtaining a licence for the\r\nconstruction of this type of ship; one of the Forlaninis was to be built\r\nin Italy, and two by Messrs. Armstrong Whitworth. When the war broke\r\nout, the Parseval airship completing in Germany was confiscated by the\r\nGerman Government; and the Forlanini airship, under process of\r\nconstruction in Italy, was retained by the Italian Government. The\r\nbuilding of one of the rigid airships had just begun, and work on it was\r\nfor a time abandoned. It is necessary thus to anticipate later events,\r\nin order to show how it came about that no airships of the larger type,\r\nsuitable for distant reconnaissance with the fleet, were in the service\r\nof Great Britain during the war.\r\n\r\nThe building and manoeuvring of airships is not a pastime within the\r\nreach of a private purse. The British Government had taken advantage of\r\nthe enterprise and rivalry of private makers of aeroplanes, whom it\r\nwisely permitted to run the risks and show the way. No such policy was\r\npossible in the manufacture of airships, which is essentially a\r\nGovernment business. There was therefore, it is perhaps not fanciful to\r\nsay, something agreeable to the German temper, and disagreeable to the\r\nEnglish temper, in the airship as a weapon of war. The Germans put an\r\nabsolute trust in their Government. Yet, after all, it is the spirit of\r\na people that matters; the most magnificent and exclusive of Government\r\norganizations will fail through weakness if it is not ultimately based\r\non the voluntary efforts and ingrained habits of the people who stand\r\nbehind the Government and support it. The German navy was a powerful and\r\nsplendid growth, fostered by the Government. But it was a forced growth,\r\nand the failure of the German operations at sea, regarded broadly, must\r\nbe credited not to the British navy, but to the whole body of British\r\nseamen, naval and civilian. The British navy was at its appointed\r\nstations; the temper of a seafaring people, self-reliant, resourceful,\r\nand indomitable, was everywhere, and shone like a phosphorescence over\r\nthousands of unregarded acts of sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe private enterprises of officers and men in the navy are limited by\r\nthe conditions of the service, but such opportunities as could be found\r\nor made were not neglected. While the _Mayfly_ was building at\r\nBarrow-in-Furness Commander Oliver Swann purchased an Avro aeroplane and\r\nwith the help of subscriptions from other officers and officers' wives\r\nmade many experiments with a view to adapting it for work over the\r\nwater. He tried different types of floats on the machine, and at last,\r\non the 18th of November 1911, he succeeded in getting off the water for\r\na very short flight. He was the first in England to achieve this feat,\r\nand from that time forward the development of seaplanes progressed\r\nrapidly. A full account of these experiments was sent by Captain Sueter\r\nto Lord Rayleigh's Advisory Committee, and thereafter a valuable series\r\nof researches was conducted at the National Physical Laboratory by Mr.\r\nG. S. Baker and others. One result of these researches was the\r\ndevelopment of a boat-shaped type of float, with flared bows, in\r\naddition to the toboggan shape.\r\n\r\nExperiment was active also at Eastchurch. During the summer of 1911 the\r\nfour naval officers whom Mr. Cockburn had taught to fly continued to\r\nmake practice flights on the two machines supplied by Mr. McClean. In\r\nOctober Lieutenant Samson succeeded in persuading the Admiralty to buy\r\nthe two aeroplanes and to send to Eastchurch twelve naval ratings, as\r\nthe basis of a naval flying school. The experiments of this little band\r\nof pioneers were all directed to adapting the aeroplane to naval work.\r\nLieutenant Longmore and Mr. Oswald Short designed and tested airbags, by\r\nthe aid of which a machine successfully alighted on the water.\r\nLieutenant Samson designed and got leave to build in Chatham Dockyard a\r\nplatform with a double trackway for starting aeroplanes from the decks\r\nof ships. The idea at this time was that the machine should start from\r\nthe ship and by the aid of the airbags should alight on the water under\r\nthe lee of the ship, whence it could be lifted on board. The platform\r\nwas erected on board H.M.S. _Africa_, and Lieutenant Samson made a\r\nsuccessful flight from it in December 1911. Thereafter, with the help of\r\nMr. Horace Short, he worked out a design for a seaplane; the machine\r\nwas completed in March 1912 and its first flight was made at Portland.\r\nOn this seaplane Lieutenant Samson flew, first and last, for about a\r\nhundred and fifty hours, without breaking a strut or a float, which is a\r\nsignal testimony to the merits of both the design and the construction.\r\nThe Royal Aircraft Factory, working for the Air Department of the\r\nAdmiralty, also produced a seaplane, which was successfully tested on\r\nFleet Pond. Meantime the first flying boat had been designed by Mr.\r\nSopwith, so that all the material requisite for naval aviation was\r\nrapidly making its appearance. If the number of aviators was still very\r\nsmall, that was due to lack of opportunity, not to lack of zeal among\r\nnaval officers. When the original four were taught to fly their names\r\nwere selected from a list of about two hundred, all of whom had\r\nvolunteered for the new service.\r\n\r\nScattered incidents and experiments, like those narrated above, are what\r\nmake up the history of the beginnings of the national air force. In such\r\na story no closely-knit dramatic sequence is possible. The history of\r\nthe growth of an oak tree from an acorn may perhaps be told in dramatic\r\nform, but who can tell the history of the obscure workings of yeast, or\r\nof the growth of a field of grass? The earliest aviators were\r\nself-willed and diverse. As Captain Bertram Dickson remarked, when he\r\nwas questioned concerning their enrolment for the national service, 'One\r\nman is a rich man; another man is an artist, or he is an actor; another\r\nman is a mechanic. They are funny fellows. You will get a certain number\r\nif you pay them well, because they are out for making money; you will\r\nget others who will do it for sport, and others who will do it for the\r\nadvertisement.' The problem for the Government and for those who advised\r\nthe Government was how to make a united body out of these odds and\r\nends; how to reduce these talented, excitable, artistic, highly\r\nindividual elements to the discipline and purpose of a great service.\r\nTwo admirable instructors were at hand--the army and the navy. The thing\r\nhad to be done quickly, and most of those soldiers and sailors who\r\nrealized the importance of the problem were agreed in thinking that the\r\nonly right way was to get the army and the navy each of them to develop\r\nits air service. Some others, looking at the thing in a broader light,\r\nheld that the air should have its own service. The laws and habits of\r\nthe land, they argued, are not the laws and habits of the sea; surely\r\nthe air differs from both of them as much as they differ from each\r\nother. But this opinion could not be acted on at short notice. A great\r\nservice cannot be built up from the beginning in one year, or even in\r\nthe lifetime of one generation of men. Time is needed; and time was what\r\nwas lacking. The only resource for immediate purposes was to engage the\r\nsympathies of the army and the navy, who are always willing to\r\nco-operate, though never to coalesce, and let each of them build, up its\r\nown air service after its own fashion. A certain formal unity, which\r\nmight by degrees become a real unity, could be given to the two air\r\nservices by the magic of a uniform and a name.\r\n\r\nMeantime, what of the Air Battalion, which was formed in the spring of\r\n1911, and continued in being until it was annulled and superseded by the\r\nformation of the Royal Flying Corps in the spring of 1912? The Air\r\nBattalion numbered among its officers men distinguished for their\r\nachievement, but it was born out of due time. These years, 1911 and\r\n1912, were years of divided counsels and uncertain policy. Rumours and\r\nreports of the passenger-carrying flights of the Zeppelin, which by this\r\ntime had outlived its early misfortunes, and of the formidable\r\ndevelopment of the French military aeroplane, distracted opinion and\r\nparalysed effort. The old debate between heavier than air and lighter\r\nthan air was reopened. England could not hope to overtake Germany in the\r\nconstruction of airships; could she hope to match France in the\r\nproduction of aeroplanes? And if she could, was there not a chance,\r\nafter all, that the future, even for military purposes, lay with the\r\nairship? The very composition of the Air Battalion reflected these\r\nuncertainties. Its headquarters were at Farnborough; the flying camp for\r\naeroplanes was at Larkhill. Sir Alexander Bannerman, who was in command,\r\nwas a balloon expert, with a distinguished record in the South African\r\nand Russo-Japanese wars. At a later date, in April 1912, he qualified as\r\nan aviator on a Bristol biplane at Brooklands. His adjutant, Captain P.\r\nW. L. Broke-Smith, had been an instructor at the balloon school, and was\r\na skilled military airship pilot. Of the officers attached, Captain J.\r\nD. B. Fulton, of the Royal Field Artillery, and Captain C. J. Burke, of\r\nthe Royal Irish Regiment, have inscribed their names on the history of\r\naviation; Captain A. D. Carden, of the Royal Engineers, and Captain E.\r\nM. Maitland, of the Essex Regiment, were apostles of the airship.\r\nCaptain Carden was an expert in meteorology, and Captain Maitland's name\r\nwill long be remembered in connexion with the first airship flight\r\nacross the Atlantic, achieved by the R 34, piloted by Major G. H. Scott,\r\nin July 1919. The gradual rise in esteem of aviation is witnessed by the\r\nfact that during the last days of the Air Battalion's short career not\r\nonly Sir Alexander Bannerman but also Captain Broke-Smith and Captain\r\nCarden were engaged in qualifying for the aviation certificate of the\r\nRoyal Aero Club. There is, of course, no inconsistency in the union of\r\nthe two methods; the Air Battalion took all aeronautics for its\r\nprovince; there need be no falling out between the aeroplane pilot and\r\nthe airship pilot so long as each recognizes and believes in the other.\r\nWhat most delayed progress was that the higher authorities did not know\r\nwhat to encourage. The most valuable work done for the national air\r\nforce in the winter of 1911-12 was done in committee at Whitehall, where\r\nthe whole matter was conscientiously investigated, and the scheme of the\r\nRoyal Flying Corps was prepared. Meantime the Air Battalion, in view of\r\nits probable speedy extinction, received very little support. The number\r\nof aeroplanes supplied to the flying camp at Larkhill was almost\r\nludicrously small, and a large proportion of the time spent in training\r\nwas devoted to theory and observation work.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of the position appear in a memorandum sent by the\r\ncommandant on the 25th of August 1911 to the chief engineer at\r\nAldershot. This memorandum discusses the employment of the battalion\r\nduring the coming winter, and recommends that No. 2 Company (that is,\r\nthe aeroplane company) be recalled to Farnborough for a time, 'in order\r\nthat the men may live in barracks, do a little drill, and be generally\r\nsmartened up'. But as some new machines will need trying during the\r\nwinter, a detachment of the company, it is suggested, should be kept on\r\nSalisbury Plain, and its members changed from time to time, so as to\r\nprevent the discipline of the company from becoming too lax. Further it\r\nis urged that extra leave for a period of two months should be granted\r\nto officers, so that they may go abroad and see what is being done in\r\nforeign countries. In discussing the question of special pay for\r\nofficers the commandant remarks that there is a tendency to devote\r\nattention solely to aeroplanes. 'At present there are, I believe, forty\r\napplicants for vacancies with the aeroplanes, and as far as I know none\r\nfor work with the dirigibles.' If the rates of pay were made less for\r\ndirigibles than for aeroplanes, as is done in foreign countries, this\r\ndifficulty, he says, would be accentuated.\r\n\r\nThese misgivings were justified by the event. The recommendations of the\r\ncommandant were, in the main, carried out, but the conditions during the\r\nwinter made progress almost impossible. There were no proper living\r\nquarters at Larkhill, so officers and men lived at Bulford--the officers\r\nat the Royal Artillery Mess--and went to and from their work in horsed\r\ntransport wagons. As they used to go down to Bulford for dinner at\r\nmidday, the actual work done in the sheds was inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nA further very real difficulty was inevitable, and might be compared to\r\nthe growing pains of any healthy organism. The air forces of Great\r\nBritain took their origin, as has been explained, from the Royal\r\nEngineers. For a very long time--something over a quarter of a\r\ncentury--the Royal Engineers had the monopoly of the air. When science\r\nquickened new growth, this new growth was still attached by habit and\r\ntradition to the old body. In March 1912 eight out of fourteen officers\r\nof the Air Battalion were members of the Royal Engineers. The remainder,\r\nincluding some of the keenest students of aviation--Captain Fulton,\r\nCaptain Burke, Captain Maitland, Lieutenant Barrington-Kennett--were, in\r\na regimental sense, interlopers. Those who understand the strength and\r\nvirtue of regimental society and regimental tradition will easily\r\nunderstand also how in a mixed body the old loyalty and the new pull\r\ndifferent ways and impede the smooth working of the machine.\r\n\r\nAll these difficulties deserve mention if only because they did in fact\r\nmake the work on Salisbury Plain poor and ineffective during the winter\r\nof 1911-12. But they are not the whole of the story. 'The first thing\r\nthat strikes me', Keats once wrote to a friend, 'on hearing of trouble\r\nhaving befallen another is this--\"Well, it cannot be helped, he will\r\nhave the pleasure of trying the resources of his spirit.\"' That pleasure\r\nwas enjoyed by the little band of stalwarts who about the end of April\r\n1911 went into camp at Larkhill as No. 2 Company, Air Battalion. If they\r\nreceived scant encouragement, they got to work without waiting for more.\r\nWhen Mr. Cockburn, after instructing the naval officers at Eastchurch,\r\nreturned to Larkhill to find his old machine, he found the company in\r\npossession on the plain. Captain Fulton was in command. Most of the\r\nofficers had had some little experience of flying. 'Captain Fulton',\r\nsays Mr. Cockburn, 'had had some practice on my machine; Lieutenant\r\nConner had had some also, but not nearly so much. Captain Burke had\r\nlearnt in France, and was about on a par with Captain Fulton. These two\r\nwere certainly the best pilots at that time. Lieutenant\r\nBarrington-Kennett had had a short course on a Bleriot some time before,\r\nbut had not flown for some months. Lieutenant Cammell was flying a\r\nBleriot of weird and wonderful type, his own property. These were the\r\noriginals, but Captain Loraine and Lieutenant Hynes joined soon\r\nafterwards.' To these names should be added another--Lieutenant H. R. P.\r\nReynolds, of the Royal Engineers.\r\n\r\nHaving taught the navy to fly, Mr. Cockburn now lent his help to the\r\narmy. 'The machines', he says, 'with the exception of the Bleriot were\r\neither Farmans or Bristol box-kites.... Lieutenant Barrington-Kennett\r\nhad no experience on these, and Lieutenant Reynolds had no experience on\r\nanything. The experience of the remainder was not sufficient to admit of\r\ntheir acting as Instructors, so Captain Fulton got permission for me to\r\ncarry on and take Barrington-Kennett and Reynolds in hand. This was an\r\neasy business compared with Eastchurch--a three miles' straight with\r\ngood landing all the way made the first flights an easy matter. There\r\nwere no incidents, except in a joy-ride for Lieutenant Cammell when his\r\ncap blew off and back into the propeller, causing a most tremendous\r\nnoise which scared us badly, me particularly, as I didn't know the\r\ncause.... Progress was good; every one was very keen; and the Air\r\nBattalion soon developed into quite respectable pilots without any\r\naccidents.'\r\n\r\nThe company had a glorious and adventurous summer. It is strange to\r\ncompare their doings with the elaborate exercises which were being\r\npractised at the same time by the French air corps at the Camp de\r\nChalons. On Salisbury Plain very little effort was made to co-operate\r\nwith other arms, except spasmodically. The pilots were new to their\r\nwork, and the triumph was to get into the air at all. The first united\r\neffort of the battalion, says Mr. Cockburn, was to fly from Larkhill to\r\nFarnborough. 'It was a most exciting event; they went off at intervals,\r\nand every one of them got there. It was a very creditable performance\r\nboth for them and for their mechanics. It must be remembered that the\r\nlatter were all inexperienced, but what they lacked in experience they\r\nmade up for in zest, always ready to learn, and as keen as possible to\r\ngo up. One of them at this time was the eldest of the McCuddens, and\r\nmany of the others are now (1918) officers holding considerable\r\npositions in the Royal Air Force. They were a fine lot of men, and\r\ndeserve their success as pioneers.'\r\n\r\nThe higher grade Aero Club certificate was obtainable by the successful\r\nperformance of a cross-country flight to a destination named a short\r\ntime before the start. Cross-country flights were much in fashion, so\r\nthat pilots were away from the battalion for about half their time. They\r\nflew in mufti; Lieutenants Barrington-Kennett and Reynolds more than\r\nonce got into trouble for being away as much as a week at a time. These\r\nabsences were sometimes due to engine failure, sometimes (it was\r\nbelieved) to the discovery of a well-provided country house and kind\r\nhosts.\r\n\r\nThe army manoeuvres of August 1911, appointed to be held in\r\nCambridgeshire, were the event of the summer; and the Air Battalion was\r\ndetailed to take part in them. Owing to the shortage of water in that\r\ndroughty summer the event never came off, but the aeroplane company\r\nstarted from Larkhill, and met with plenty of incident on the way. Air\r\nCommodore Brooke-Popham, who was at that time attached to the company\r\nfrom the Staff College, has very kindly set down his memories of the\r\nflight. He started from Larkhill with Captain Burke on the old Farman,\r\nwith the object of making Oxford, but owing to a slight adverse wind and\r\nthe low speed of the machine, which made only thirty miles an hour in a\r\ncalm, they had to be content with Wantage, and got to Oxford the next\r\nmorning. Lieutenant Barrington-Kennett, with a mechanic, made a forced\r\nlanding in the neighbourhood of Burford, but with the assistance of\r\nCaptain Brooke-Popham and Lieutenant Hynes, who went to his rescue in\r\nthe only motor vehicle possessed by the company, he got into the air\r\nagain, and also reached Oxford. Meantime Lieutenant Conner had had a\r\ncrash in a fog, without hurting himself, on high ground at West Ilsley,\r\nsouth of Oxford. Maps, in those days, were mostly provided by the\r\nofficers themselves, and Lieutenant Conner had steered himself\r\nsuccessfully by the aid of a map torn out of a Bradshaw Railway Guide.\r\nEventually the mobilized military air force of the British Empire, that\r\nis to say, Captains Burke, Brooke-Popham, and Massy, Lieutenants\r\nBarrington-Kennett and Reynolds, arrived in Oxford, at the end of the\r\nfirst stage. Here there were no tools available for repair, the few\r\nbelonging to the company having been dispatched, by orders given at\r\ncross-purposes, straight to Cambridge. Nevertheless the little band of\r\nenthusiasts bravely started on the last stage of their journey. Captains\r\nBurke and Brooke-Popham had engine failure about ten miles out of\r\nOxford, and, landing in a ridge-and-furrow field, broke a tail skid.\r\nMost of the day was consumed in getting this skid mended, patchwork\r\nfashion, by a coachbuilder in Oxford, to procure whose aid Captain\r\nBrooke-Popham returned to Oxford by earth. When the machine flew again\r\nit was forced to land at once, this time with serious damage. The other\r\nthree officers had all been compelled by the bumpy weather to land not\r\nmany miles away. In the evening they started again. Captain Massy had\r\nengine trouble fifty yards from the start, and completely wrecked his\r\nmachine without hurting himself at all. Lieutenant Reynolds, who was the\r\nnext to go, ran into a thunder-storm. His famous accident deserves to be\r\nrecorded in his own words:\r\n\r\n'That evening, soon after seven o'clock, I started again, it was warm\r\nand fine but rather suggestive of thunder; the air was perfectly still.\r\nI scarcely had occasion to move the control lever at all until I got to\r\nBletchley, where it began to get rather bumpy; at first I thought\r\nnothing of this, but suddenly it got much worse, and I came to the\r\nconclusion it was time to descend. A big black thunder-cloud was coming\r\nup on my right front; it did not look reassuring, and there was good\r\nlanding ground below. At this time I was flying about 1,700 feet\r\naltitude by my aneroid, which had been set at Oxford in the morning. I\r\nbegan a glide, but almost directly I had switched off the tail of the\r\nmachine was suddenly wrenched upwards as if it had been hit from below,\r\nand I saw the elevator go down perpendicularly below me. I was not\r\nstrapped in, and I suppose I caught hold of the uprights at my side, for\r\nthe next thing I realized was that I was lying in a heap on what\r\nordinarily is the under surface of the top plane. The machine in fact\r\nwas upside-down. I stood up, held on, and waited. The machine just\r\nfloated about, gliding from side to side like a piece of paper falling.\r\nThen it over-swung itself, so to speak, and went down more or less\r\nvertically sideways until it righted itself momentarily the right way\r\nup.\r\n\r\n'Then it went down tail first, turned over upside-down again, and\r\nrestarted the old floating motion. We were still some way from the\r\nground, and took what seemed like a long time in reaching it. I looked\r\nround somewhat hurriedly; the tail was still there, and I could see\r\nnothing wrong. As we got close to the ground the machine was doing long\r\nswings from side to side, and I made up my mind that the only thing to\r\ndo was to try and jump clear of the wreckage before the crash. In the\r\nlast swing we slid down, I think, about thirty feet, and hit the ground\r\npretty hard. Fortunately I hung on practically to the end, and,\r\naccording to those who were looking on, I did not jump till about ten\r\nfeet from the ground.'\r\n\r\nThose who were looking on were two men, stark naked, who had been\r\nbathing near by. About fifty or sixty people soon collected, and some\r\ntime passed before it occurred to any one to remark that these two men\r\nhad no clothes on.\r\n\r\nThe military air force of the Empire had now been reduced to two\r\nserviceable aeroplanes which got to Cambridge, one piloted by Lieutenant\r\nBarrington-Kennett, the other by Lieutenant Cammell, who had been\r\ndelayed at Larkhill for some days but had flown by way of London without\r\nmishap. These officers were well received and entertained by the\r\nresident members of the University.\r\n\r\nLater in the autumn the Government bought some new machines for the\r\nbattalion. In one of these, a two-seater Nieuport monoplane, with a\r\nfifty horse-power Gnome engine, Lieutenant Barrington-Kennett made a\r\nrecord passenger-carrying flight. On the 14th of February 1912 he flew\r\n249-1/2 miles in four hours thirty-two minutes. In a rapidly advancing\r\ntide every wave makes a record, which is obliterated by the next wave.\r\nBut the use of the word 'record', so frequent in the annals of aviation,\r\ndoes convey some sense of the exhilaration of the pioneers. Another of\r\nthe machines supplied by the Government was a Breguet biplane with a\r\nsixty horse-power Renault engine. 'It was a most unwholesome beast,'\r\nsays Mr. Cockburn, 'with flexible wings, steel spars, and wheel\r\ncontrol.' It required enormous strength to steer it, and was\r\nperseveringly and valorously flown by Lieutenant Hynes. There was also a\r\nDeperdussin two-seater monoplane, which Captain Fulton flew; and the\r\nearliest of the B.E. machines from the Aircraft Factory, which fell to\r\nthe lot of Captain Burke. The battalion was much impressed by the number\r\nof instruments fitted to their new machines. In the machines they were\r\naccustomed to there was nothing but a revolution counter, and sometimes,\r\nthough not always, a compass. If the pilot's scientific ambitions went\r\nbeyond this simple outfit, he carried a watch on his wrist and an\r\naneroid slung round his neck. The risks that these early pilots\r\ncheerfully faced at the call of duty were serious enough, and it is\r\nsurprising that their casualties were so few. The only fatal accident in\r\nthe Air Battalion was the death of Lieutenant R. A. Cammell, R.E., who\r\nwas killed while flying a Valkyrie monoplane at Hendon on the 17th of\r\nSeptember 1911. The machine was not familiar to him, and it is believed\r\nthat he forgot to work the forward elevator; at the height of about\r\nninety feet the monoplane tilted to one side, and fell with a crash.\r\nLieutenant Cammell was one of the pioneers of British military aviation.\r\nSo early as June 1910 he had been sent to France to take over a Bleriot\r\nmachine. He attended the Rheims meeting of that year and sent home some\r\nvaluable reports. He was a daring and skilful aviator, and had\r\nqualified also as an airship pilot.\r\n\r\nThe story of Great Britain's apprenticeship in the air has now been\r\nbrought down to the point at which the Royal Flying Corps, famous on\r\nevery battle front of the world war, makes its first appearance. So far\r\nit has been a story of small things, of interrupted experiments and\r\ntentative advances; of the caution of the Government, and the boldness\r\nof the private adventurer. There is nothing new in the story; the air\r\nwas attacked and mastered in the English fashion. When we are confronted\r\nwith great issues, it is our habit, or so we are fond of saying, to\r\n'muddle through'. Foreign nations, and especially enemy nations, do not\r\nso describe our activities. But we are great self-critics, and not free\r\nfrom that kind of inverted self-esteem which makes a man speak of his\r\nown achievements with deceitful and extravagant modesty. The business of\r\nhistory is to tell the truth; the truth is that we muddle through with\r\namazing success. This success we affect to regard as an undeserved\r\nreward bestowed by Providence on improvidence. But is the law of cause\r\nand effect really made void on our behalf? The people of the island, it\r\nis true, are slow to make up their minds; their respect for experience\r\nand their care for justice make them distrust quick action if it is not\r\ninstinctive action. They are unimaginative in this sense, that they are\r\nnot very readily excited by the theatrical exhortations which are\r\naddressed to them from day to day. In a much deeper sense they are\r\nimaginative; they have a sure instinct for the realities of life. When\r\nthey are presented with a doubtful novelty, they prefer to wait; and\r\nthey can afford to wait, for they know that their young will be eager to\r\nshow the way, and, in the meantime, they are not afraid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL FLYING CORPS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November 1911 the Prime Minister requested the standing sub-committee\r\nof the Committee of Imperial Defence, under the chairmanship of Lord\r\nHaldane, to consider the future development of aerial navigation for\r\nnaval and military purposes, and the measures which might be taken to\r\nsecure to this country an efficient aerial service. Things had moved\r\nfast since 1908, when a distinguished general had expounded to a similar\r\ncommittee the futility of observation from the air. This time the\r\ncommittee came to a quick decision, and recommended immediate action.\r\nThe chief of their recommendations were as follows:\r\n\r\n     The creation of a British Aeronautical Service, to be regarded as\r\n     one, and to be designated 'The Flying Corps'.\r\n\r\n     The Corps to consist of a Naval Wing, a Military Wing, and a\r\n     Central Flying School for the training of pilots.\r\n\r\n     The Flying Corps to be kept in the closest possible collaboration\r\n     with the Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and with the Aircraft\r\n     Factory, so that the work of experiment and research should have\r\n     its due influence on practice.\r\n\r\n     A permanent consultative committee, named 'The Air Committee', to\r\n     be appointed, to deal with all aeronautical questions affecting\r\n     both the Admiralty and the War Office.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of a detailed scheme was delegated to a technical\r\nsub-committee consisting of Colonel the Right Hon. J. E. B. Seely, as\r\nchairman, Brigadier-General G. K. Scott-Moncrieff, Brigadier-General\r\nDavid Henderson, Commander C. R. Samson, R.N., Lieutenant R. Gregory,\r\nR.N., and Mr. Mervyn O'Gorman, with Rear-Admiral Sir C. L. Ottley and\r\nCaptain M. P. A. Hankey as secretaries. The deliberations of this body\r\nwere remarkable for agreement and dispatch; their report was ready by\r\nthe 27th of February 1912; it passed through its successive stages with\r\nvery few alterations, and was approved by the Committee of Imperial\r\nDefence on the 25th of April.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Flying Corps was constituted by a Royal Warrant on the 13th of\r\nApril 1912; a special Army Order was issued two days later setting up\r\nthe necessary regulations, and on the 13th of May the old Air Battalion\r\nand its reserve were finally absorbed by the new body.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of government by committee is that it obtains, by\r\nsuccessive stages, the sanction and support of the many for the plans\r\ninitiated by the few. Nothing was ever created by eight men. But eight\r\nor more men, expert in various ways, can render invaluable service by\r\nlistening, criticizing, and befriending. The plans which were considered\r\nand adopted by the technical sub-committee had been prepared in private\r\nby a small informal body of three, that is to say, by Brigadier-General\r\nDavid Henderson, Captain F. H. Sykes, and Major D. S. MacInnes.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General David Henderson had served at the battle of Khartoum\r\nin 1898, and had distinguished himself in the South African War. He was\r\nthe author of a book on _The Art of Reconnaissance_, which ran through\r\nseveral editions. His interest in reconnaissance, and his appreciation\r\nof its importance in war, made him a friend to aviation. In 1911, at the\r\nage of forty-nine, he had learned to fly at Brooklands, and thereafter,\r\nas Director of Military Training at the War Office, did all in his\r\npower to encourage the new movement. Captain Frederick Hugh Sykes was a\r\nGeneral Staff officer who had seen service in many lands. In the South\r\nAfrican War he served with the Imperial Yeomanry, and was severely\r\nwounded. In 1901 he joined the 15th or King's Hussars, and for two years\r\nwas stationed in West Africa. Thereafter he was attached to the\r\nIntelligence Department at Army Headquarters in India, passed the Staff\r\nCollege, and in February 1911 became General Staff officer in the\r\nDirectorate of Military Operations under Brigadier-General Sir Henry\r\nWilson. It was in July and August 1904, while he was on leave from West\r\nAfrica, that he made his first acquaintance with the air. He obtained\r\npermission to be attached to the balloon units training with the army on\r\nSalisbury Plain; made many ascents, and went through the course and\r\nexamination at the Farnborough balloon school. Thenceforward he took\r\nevery possible opportunity to improve his knowledge of aeronautics. He\r\nwas quick to discern the significance of aviation. When, in 1910, he saw\r\nflight in France, he recognized that the work of cavalry in distant\r\nreconnaissance was dead and done with. During his time at the War Office\r\nhe spent the mornings, before breakfast, in learning to fly, and in June\r\n1911 took his pilot's certificate on a Bristol biplane at Brooklands.\r\nWithin the office he insisted on the importance of military aeronautics,\r\nand when the Committee of Imperial Defence took up the question he was\r\nnaturally chosen to serve on the committee which prepared a draft\r\norganization. Associated with him was Major Duncan Sayre MacInnes, of\r\nthe Royal Engineers, who had been through the South African War, and at\r\nthe time of the formation of the Flying Corps was serving with the\r\nMilitary Training Directorate. Only those who worked with him will ever\r\nknow how great a debt the Flying Corps owes to his industry and\r\ndevotion. During the war he was employed under the Directorate of\r\nMilitary Aeronautics, and in 1916 was made Director of Aircraft\r\nEquipment, with the rank of brigadier-general. He wore himself out in\r\nthe service of the country, and died in May 1918. These three men laid\r\nthe groundwork of the plans which were approved by the technical\r\nsub-committee.\r\n\r\nThe record of the preliminary meetings of the sub-committee, and of the\r\nevidence given by witnesses, is full of interest, and shows history in\r\nthe making. 'It has been suggested to me', said the chairman, 'that the\r\nRoyal Flying Corps is a better name than the Royal Air Corps.' And\r\nagain, when the name for the tactical unit of the force was under\r\nconsideration, and objection was taken to the words 'company' and\r\n'group'--'Why not squadron?' said the chairman. It is the happiness of\r\nthe small technical sub-committee that the scheme which they approved\r\nwas equal to the strain of an unexampled war, and that the very names\r\nwhich they chose are now engraved on the history of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe choice of the squadron, consisting of three flights of aeroplanes,\r\nwith four machines to a flight, as the unit of the new force was\r\njudicious and far-sighted. In France the unit was the 'escadrille',\r\nconsisting of six machines, and roughly corresponding to what we call a\r\nflight. This precedent was rejected. Not enough competent officers, it\r\nwas feared, were available to command a large number of small\r\nindependent units. On the other hand, if too large a unit had been\r\nchosen, it would have been difficult to put the air service at the\r\ndisposal of the various army formations which might ask for assistance\r\nfrom the air. The squadron, when it was created, was elastic and\r\nmanageable, and secured for the air force, as the war has proved, that\r\ncorporate spirit and that pride in history and tradition which are the\r\nstrength of the regimental system.\r\n\r\nThe deliberations of the sub-committee were conducted in a severely\r\npractical spirit. Many of the constructive problems which came before\r\nthem still remain problems, and might have been debated, with much to be\r\nsaid on both sides, till the conversion of the Jews; but the pressure of\r\ntime made itself ominously felt in all their proceedings. The country,\r\nas a whole, was not awake to the German menace. The sudden appearance of\r\nthe German gunboat _Panther_ at Agadir in July 1911 ought, it may be\r\nsaid, to have awakened it. But the average Englishman could hardly bring\r\nhimself to believe that a great European nation would seek war as a\r\nduellist seeks a quarrel, from sensitive vanity and pride in his own\r\nfighting skill. The army and the navy were quicker to discern the\r\nreality of the threat. The military machine that was to supply the small\r\nexpeditionary force was working at high pressure, and the air was tense.\r\nIf Germany intended to make her bid for the mastery of Europe, it was\r\nrecognized that she had every reason for making it soon. 'All the heads\r\nof departments', said the chairman, at a meeting in January 1912, 'are\r\nvery anxious to get on with this--Lord Haldane told me so last night,\r\nMr. Churchill told me so two or three days ago, and the Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer himself is anxious to see it done, and wisely: but what is\r\nthe best method to pursue in order to do in a week what is generally\r\ndone in a year?' 'At the present time in this country,' he said later,\r\n'we have, as far as I know, of actual flying men in the Army about\r\neleven, and of actual flying men in the Navy about eight, and France has\r\nabout two hundred and sixty-three, so we are what you might call\r\nbehind.'\r\n\r\nMoreover, the committee realized that an air service would be needed by\r\nthe army of Great Britain more than it is needed by the armies of\r\nforeign powers. In a memorandum by the War Office, drawn up in the same\r\nmonth of January 1912, it is pointed out that a British expeditionary\r\nforce might have to operate as a detached force, and that to such a\r\nforce information is all-important. The need for haste appears in many\r\nof the recommendations of the committee. For the supply of trained\r\nflyers to the army and the navy, and for the formation of a reserve, the\r\nfirst necessity was to start work at the Central Flying School, for\r\nwhich a site had been chosen on the Upavon Downs of Salisbury Plain,\r\nnorth of the Upavon-Everley road. The buildings necessary for this\r\nschool could not be ready till the end of June, so the committee\r\nrecommended that the work of the school should, in the meantime, be\r\ncarried on in canvas tents and sheds.\r\n\r\nSome problems of wide import forced themselves on the attention of the\r\ncommittee, and were of necessity settled with a view to immediate\r\nresults and immediate efficiency. When shelter is needed from a pitiless\r\nstorm, the leisurely plans of the architect must give way. One of these\r\nproblems was the rank of pilots. Should every pilot be an officer, or\r\nshould we follow the example of France, and train some mechanics to the\r\nwork of piloting? From the first, Mr. Churchill was in favour of\r\nadmitting to the State school of aviation not only a proportion of\r\nofficers of both services, but also petty officers, non-commissioned\r\nofficers and men, as well as civilians. In the report of the technical\r\nsub-committee the war establishment for an expeditionary force is\r\nplanned on these lines. The Military Wing of the Royal Flying Corps was\r\nto contain seven aeroplane squadrons, each squadron to number twelve\r\nmachines, with an additional machine for the commanding officer. Two\r\npilots were allowed for each aeroplane, and, in addition, to provide for\r\nthe wastage of war, an equal number in reserve. The war establishment,\r\ncalculated on this basis for the purposes of the expeditionary force,\r\nrequired the services of three hundred and sixty-four trained pilots, of\r\nwhom, it was suggested, one hundred and eighty-two should be officers,\r\nand one hundred and eighty-two non-commissioned officers.\r\n\r\nThis part of the scheme cannot be said to have failed in practice: it\r\nnever reached the test of practice. The surest and readiest way to\r\nobtain the services of skilled flyers was to offer them commissions in\r\nthe Flying Corps, and it was felt to be invidious that some pilots\r\nshould enter the corps as officers, while others, of equal skill, should\r\nenter in the non-commissioned ranks. Some of the witnesses were of the\r\nopinion that not many men of the skilled mechanic class would be ready\r\nor willing to risk their lives as pilots. The experience of the war has\r\ndisproved this forecast; an observer in war must have at least as cool a\r\nhead and as stout a heart as a pilot, and every one who has flown on the\r\nwestern front knows that among the very best observers not a few were\r\nnon-commissioned officers. But the fact is that the question was settled\r\nby lack of time. To give effect to the scheme outlined in the report of\r\nthe technical sub-committee would have required much time and experiment\r\nand adjustment; in practice the simpler way was chosen, and the business\r\nof piloting was reserved, in the main, for commissioned officers.\r\nCourage is found everywhere among English-speaking peoples; the real\r\npoint to secure is that the pilots of one squadron, or the pilot and\r\nobserver of one machine, should not only meet on duty, but should live\r\ntogether. That perfect understanding and instant collaboration which\r\nspells efficiency in the air is the product of habitual intimacy and\r\neasy association during leisure hours.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Royal Flying Corps a certain small number of\r\nnon-commissioned officers were trained to do the work of piloting, so\r\nthat the officers who flew with them in two-seater machines might be\r\nfreed for the more important work of observation. This experiment was\r\nnot favourably reported on, and the opinion has often been expressed\r\nthat men chosen from the non-commissioned ranks of the army or the\r\nlower-deck ratings of the navy do not make good pilots. A wise judgement\r\non the question will consider all the circumstances. Promotion in both\r\narmy and navy was slow before the war, so that a non-commissioned\r\nofficer or petty officer was often a married man, considerably in\r\nadvance of the age at which the most successful war pilots are made. The\r\ninspired recklessness of youth does not long persist among those who\r\nfrom boyhood up have to earn their living by responsible work. Moreover,\r\ncommanding officers, whether in the army or the navy, were naturally\r\nreluctant to let their skilled men be taken from them, so that the men\r\nwhom they sent to be trained as pilots were too often men for whom no\r\nother good use could be found. 'If they don't break their necks,' said\r\none naval officer, 'it will wake them up.' Again, in 1918, when cadets,\r\nafter a preliminary technical training, were graded as officer cadets or\r\nnon-commissioned officer cadets, all the more promising men were given\r\ncommissions, so that only men of inferior intelligence were left to\r\nbecome non-commissioned pilots. It is surely rash to lay stress on vague\r\nclass distinctions. A stander-by who happened, during the war, to\r\nwitness the management of an Arab camel convoy by a handful of British\r\nprivate soldiers, remarked that though these soldiers knew no language\r\nbut their own, their initiative and tact, their natural assumption of\r\nauthority, and their unfailing good temper, which at last got the convoy\r\nunder way, showed that they belonged to an imperial race. The question\r\nof the rank of pilots is really a social question, a question, that is\r\nto say, not of individual superiority but of smooth collaboration. If a\r\nwhole squadron of the Flying Corps had been staffed, as was at one time\r\nsuggested, by men picked from the non-commissioned ranks, there can be\r\nno doubt that it would have made a name for itself among the very best.\r\n\r\nThe largest question of all in the making of the Flying Corps was the\r\nquestion whether the air service was to be a new and independent\r\nservice, taking rank with the army and the navy, or was to be, for the\r\nmost part, divided between the army and the navy, and placed under their\r\ncontrol. This question, it might seem, was settled by the opening words\r\nof the sub-committee's recommendations: 'The British Aeronautical\r\nService should be regarded as one, and should be designated \"The Flying\r\nCorps\".' But subsequent developments soon showed that this settlement\r\nwas not accepted on all hands. The navy never fully accepted it. The\r\nBritish navy is a body enormously strong in its corporate feeling,\r\nconscious of its responsibilities, proud of its history, and wedded to\r\nits own ways. Its self-reliant character, which had made it slow to\r\nrecognize the importance of the air, made it slow also, when the\r\nimportance of the air was proved, to allow a weapon necessary for naval\r\noperations to pass out of its own control. When the active combatant\r\nservice of the Royal Flying Corps came into being, it consisted of a\r\nNaval Wing and a Military Wing. The Naval Wing had its headquarters at\r\nEastchurch, where the Naval Flying School had been established. For\r\nadministrative purposes the Naval Flying School was placed under the\r\norders of the captain of H.M.S. _Actaeon_, and all officers and men were\r\nto be borne on the books of the _Actaeon_. Experiments with seaplanes\r\nand flying boats were still in their infancy, and the organization of\r\nthe Naval Wing was wisely left undetermined for the time. The\r\ndistribution of the aeroplane squadrons of the Military Wing was left\r\nfor the consideration of the War Office, but the sub-committee\r\nrecommended that one squadron should be stationed at Salisbury Plain,\r\nwithin reach of the Central Flying School, and one at Aldershot, in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Aircraft Factory. All recruits training as pilots,\r\nwhether for the Naval Wing or the Military Wing, were to graduate at the\r\nCentral Flying School, and thence were to be detailed to join either the\r\nNaval Flying School at Eastchurch, for a special course of naval\r\naviation, or one of the military aeroplane squadrons, for a special\r\ncourse of military aviation.\r\n\r\nThat was the plan. So far as the Military Wing was concerned, it was\r\npunctually carried out. In the Naval Wing a certain centrifugal tendency\r\nvery early made itself felt. The official name 'Royal Flying Corps,\r\nNaval Wing', after making its appearance in a few documents, dropped out\r\nof use, and its place was taken by a name which in process of time\r\nreceived the stamp of official recognition--'The Royal Naval Air\r\nService'. Thereafter the words 'Military Wing', though they were still\r\nused, were no longer required, and 'The Royal Flying Corps' became a\r\nsufficient description of what was a distinctively military body. The\r\nAdmiralty from the first worked independently. Soon after the Naval Wing\r\nof the Royal Flying Corps was created the First Lord of the Admiralty\r\nset up a new department to supervise it, and placed Captain Murray\r\nSueter in charge, as Director of the Air Department. At an earlier date\r\nCommander C. R. Samson had been placed in charge of the Naval Flying\r\nSchool. The energies of the school, pending the establishment of the\r\nCentral Flying School, were devoted mainly to elementary training in\r\nflying. By the provisions of the original scheme this elementary\r\ntraining belonged to the joint Central Flying School, while the Naval\r\nFlying School was to be used for experiment and for specialized\r\ntraining in naval air work. But the Naval Flying School continued\r\nthroughout the war to train naval flying officers from the beginning,\r\nteaching them the art of flying as well as its special applications for\r\nnaval purposes.\r\n\r\nThe question whether there should be a single air service, specialized\r\nin its branches, or separate air services, organized for mutual\r\nassistance, is a question that stirs deep feeling, so that the very\r\nvirtues which make men serviceable to their country are ranged in\r\nopposition one to another. The old allegiances are not easily forgotten;\r\nwhen a sailor learns to fly he remains a sailor, and the air for him is\r\nmerely the roof of the sea. The knowledge, moreover, gained from his\r\nlife at sea is knowledge not only useful but essential to him if he is\r\nto do good work in the Naval Air Service. He must be able to recognize\r\nthe various types of war vessels, and the various nationalities of\r\nvessels of the merchant marine. He must know all about the submarine,\r\nthe mine, and the torpedo. He must be well versed in weather\r\nobservation, and able to navigate safely without the aid of landmarks.\r\nHe must understand naval tactics, and must be able to bear a part in\r\nthem. All this, it has been urged by many sailors, is a much more\r\ncomplicated and experienced business than the mere flying of an\r\naeroplane. The Naval Air Service, they contend, should be a part of the\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\nThere is force and weight in these contentions, yet they are not\r\nconclusive. If the navy were itself a new invention, a very similar kind\r\nof argument might be used to subordinate it to the army. The main\r\nbusiness of the navy, it might be said, is to supply the army with\r\ntransport facilities and mobile gun-platforms. But this is absurd; the\r\nsea will not submit to so cavalier a treatment. Those who believe in a\r\nsingle air force base their opinion on certain very simple\r\nconsiderations. As the prime business of a navy is the navigation of the\r\nsea, so, they hold, the prime business of an air force is the navigation\r\nof the air; all its other activities depend on this. The science of\r\naeronautics is yet in its childhood; its development must not be cramped\r\nby tying it too closely to a service which works under narrower\r\nconditions. If there should be another great war (and though no one\r\ndesires it, no one dares to think it impossible), the fittest man to\r\nhold the command of united land and sea forces might well be a Marshal\r\nof the Air. But the strongest argument for a single air force is not so\r\nmuch an argument as an instinct. Every kind of warfare develops in men\r\nits own type of character. The virtues of the soldier and the virtues of\r\nthe sailor are not the same; or, if they are the same (for courage and\r\nduty can never be superseded), they are the same with surprising\r\ndifferences. The soldier is drilled to fight men when the occasion\r\narises; the sailor is at war all his life with the sea. The character of\r\nthe sailor--his resourcefulness and vigilance, his patience and\r\nstoicism, his dislike of formality--is put upon him by his age-long\r\nconflict with his old enemy. In seafaring men there is a temper of the\r\nsea, admired by all who have ever made acquaintance with it. Those who\r\nwere privileged to watch the performance of our flying men in the war\r\nknow that there is developed in them a temper not less remarkable and\r\nnot less worthy of cultivation--the temper of the air. War in the air\r\ndemands a quickness of thought and nerve greater than is exacted by any\r\nother kind of war. It is a deadly and gallant tournament. The airman\r\ngoes out to seek his enemy: he must be full of initiative. His ordeal\r\nmay come upon him suddenly, at any time, with less than a minute's\r\nnotice: he must be able to concentrate all his powers instantaneously to\r\nmeet it. He fights alone. During a great part of his time in the air he\r\nis within easy reach of safety; a swift glide will take him far away\r\nfrom the enemy, but he must choose danger, and carry on. One service\r\ncannot be judged by the standards of another service. A soldier who\r\nknows nothing of the sea might easily mistake naval discipline for lack\r\nof discipline. A like mistake has often been made by those who are\r\nbrought into casual relations with the air force. But the temper of the\r\nair force is a new and wonderful thing, born of the duties and dangers\r\nwhich war in the air has brought with it. To preserve that temper as a\r\nnational inheritance is the dearest wish of those who covet for the air\r\nforce a place beside the navy and the army.\r\n\r\nNow that the officers for the air force are being trained, as officers\r\nfor the navy and the army have long been trained, at a cadet college\r\nwith its own traditions, the question will solve itself. The necessity\r\nfor collaboration during the war did something to unite the branches of\r\nthe force. But perfect unity can be attained only by men who have lived\r\nand worked together. Men who have lived apart speak different languages.\r\nIn April 1918, when the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying\r\nCorps were united in the Royal Air Force, it was found necessary to deal\r\nwith this language difficulty. The Naval Air Service and the Flying\r\nCorps used different names for the same thing. The Naval Air Service\r\nused the names they would have used aboard ship. The officers' mess they\r\ncalled 'the ward-room mess', and the dining-room 'the mess deck'. The\r\ncookhouse with them was the galley; rations were victuals; and kit was\r\ngear. In July 1918 an order was issued by the Air Ministry prescribing\r\nthe terms to be adopted in the new force. The use of starboard and port\r\nfor right and left was ordered as a concession to the sailors; and at\r\nall air stations the time of day was to be denoted, as on board ship, by\r\nthe sounding of bells. In some few cases the naval and, military usages\r\nwere both discarded in favour of a new term proper to the air force.\r\nThus, non-commissioned officers and men, who are described in the navy\r\nas 'ratings' and in the army as 'other ranks', were named, in accordance\r\nwith a practice which had already grown up, 'airmen'. Names are full of\r\ncompliment and fantasy: 'airman' is the official name for those members\r\nof the air force who spend their time and do their work on the ground.\r\n\r\nThese are not light matters. One of the strongest bonds of human\r\nsympathy is community in habits of speech. Divergences in speech are\r\nfruitful in every kind of hostility. It was a Scottish captain of the\r\nmerchant marine who expressed a dislike for the French, and when called\r\non for his reasons, replied that as a people they are ridiculous, for\r\nthey call a boy a 'mousse'.\r\n\r\nThe navy and the army have always been loyal comrades, ready to help\r\neach other at short notice. These relations persisted between the two\r\nbranches of the air force. In the scheme for the Royal Flying Corps it\r\nhad been provided that each branch of the service should be treated as a\r\nreserve to the other branch. Thus in a purely naval war the whole of the\r\nFlying Corps was to be available for the navy, and in a war that should\r\ncall for no assistance from the navy (if such a war can be conceived)\r\nthe whole of the corps was to be available for the army. In accordance\r\nwith these ideas machines flown by naval officers played a very\r\nsuccessful part in the army manoeuvres of 1912 and 1913.\r\n\r\nFurther, in order to co-ordinate the efforts of the Admiralty and the\r\nWar Office, a permanent consultative committee, called the Air\r\nCommittee, was provided for in the original scheme, and held its first\r\nmeeting in July 1912. This committee was a kind of nucleus of an Air\r\nMinistry; the importance attached to it may be judged from its\r\ncomposition. Colonel Seely, by this time Secretary of State for War,\r\nwas its first chairman, and later on Vice-Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, the\r\nSecond Sea Lord of the Admiralty, became its vice-chairman. The officers\r\nin command of the Central Flying School, of the Naval Wing, and of the\r\nMilitary Wing had seats on it. So had the Director of Military Training,\r\nthe Director of the Air Department, and the Superintendent of the Royal\r\nAircraft Factory. The committee proved its value as a place of\r\nconference, where those who were responsible for aerial development in\r\nits various branches might compare their ideas. But it had no executive\r\npowers, so that its success in promoting an active policy automatically\r\ndiminished its own importance. It could consider and advise, but the\r\ndecision rested with the Admiralty and the War Office. It was useful at\r\nan early stage; then, like the Ghost in _Hamlet_, having prompted others\r\nto action, it faded away.\r\n\r\nThe need for a central controlling body, that is to say, for an Air\r\nMinistry, was soon to be acutely felt. The naval and military air forces\r\nwere friends, but they were also rivals. In so far as this rivalry\r\nprompted them to compete in skill and valour, it was wholly good. But\r\nrival orders for munitions of war, and especially for aeroplanes, given\r\nto manufacturing firms by two branches of one service, are not so good.\r\nThe output of the factories was not unlimited, and only a central\r\nauthority could determine how that output might be best used for the\r\nnation's need.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the Naval Air Service, from the time it came into\r\nbeing until the outbreak of war, were very largely experimental. Those\r\nwho were responsible for naval operations had at first no complete,\r\ndefinite, and practical scheme for the employment of aircraft in naval\r\nwarfare. It would have been difficult for them to produce such a scheme;\r\nopinion was fluctuating and divided, and the progress of aeronautical\r\nscience supplied improved machines and opened out new possibilities\r\nevery month. The time of the service was spent in demonstrating these\r\nnew possibilities, rather than in organizing and training their forces\r\nfor the needs of a definite programme. Nevertheless, this experimental\r\nperiod witnessed rapid growth and prepared the way for surprising\r\nachievements by the Naval Air Service during the war.\r\n\r\nThe uses of the Military Wing, on the other hand, were definitely\r\nconceived from the first. It was brought into being to fulfil a certain\r\npurpose. Its officers knew when and where and how their services would\r\nbe required. They knew, that is to say, that on the outbreak of war they\r\nwould be mobilized, that they would operate with an expeditionary force,\r\nand that their business would be, by observation from the air, to keep\r\nthe commanders of that force acquainted with the movements and\r\ndispositions of the enemy. The constitution of the Military Wing was\r\nelastic, so that its numbers could be increased and its uses multiplied,\r\nbut its original purpose, to supply the needs of an expeditionary force,\r\ndictated its first establishment and its early training. Its first duty\r\nwas reconnaissance. All its other and later uses were consequences of\r\nthis central purpose, and were forced on it by the hard logic of events.\r\nThe full establishment of the Military Wing was to comprise a\r\nheadquarters, seven aeroplane squadrons, and one airship and kite\r\nsquadron (providing two airships and two flights of kites). Later in the\r\nyear there was also established at South Farnborough what was then\r\ncalled a Flying Depot, Line of Communications, but was afterwards named\r\nan Aircraft Park. Its duties were the maintenance of a reserve of\r\naeroplanes, and the carrying out of such repairs as were beyond the\r\npowers of the squadron workshops yet were not serious enough to compel\r\nthe return of the machine to its maker.\r\n\r\nIn its beginnings and during its early years the Military Wing was\r\ngreatly indebted to the technical knowledge and the inventive skill of\r\nthe Royal Engineers. It was they who had produced the army balloon and\r\nthe army airship. Before the Royal Flying Corps was founded they had\r\ndevised a practicable and efficient aeroplane, and they had been chiefly\r\nresponsible for the organization of the Air Battalion. The best tribute\r\nthat could be paid to their fostering care was paid by the Royal Flying\r\nCorps when, being fully fledged, it started on its great career.\r\n\r\nThe building up of the Military Wing to fit it for its purpose was not a\r\nlight task. Skilled officers, skilled men, an adequate supply of the\r\nbest machines, suitable flying grounds in various parts of Great\r\nBritain, a well-staffed central school for training--these were some of\r\nthe first necessities. After two years, when war came, only four out of\r\nthe seven squadrons were ready for instant service in France. But the\r\nvalue of this little force was out of all proportion greater than its\r\nnumerical strength. Through all the difficulties and delays that clog a\r\nnew movement it had kept a single purpose in view and had worked for it.\r\nThe great achievements of the Royal Flying Corps during the war may seem\r\nto make its early history and early efforts a trivial thing in the\r\ncomparison. But the spirit was there; and some of the merits of the\r\nlater performance may be detected in the tedious and imperfect\r\nrehearsals, the long hours of duty-flights and experiment, demanding\r\nthat three-o'clock-in-the-morning kind of courage which is willing to\r\nface danger in the midst of a world at ease.\r\n\r\nIn March 1912 Colonel Seely had announced in the House of Commons that\r\nthere would be required at once for the Military Wing a hundred and\r\nthirty-three officers, and for the Naval Wing about thirty or forty\r\nofficers. It was not proposed at first to teach all these officers at\r\nthe Central Flying School. They would learn to fly privately, and would\r\ngo to the school for more advanced instruction. The skilled men required\r\nwere of many kinds. The most important of these were mechanics, men who\r\nhad served at full pay in engineering workshops, who had some knowledge\r\nof electricity, and could make intelligible sketches of machinery. A\r\nlist of some other classes whose services were invited proves that\r\nthough the air service was small its needs were many and complex. Men of\r\nthe following trades were to be enrolled, by enlistment or transfer, in\r\nthe Military Wing: blacksmiths, carpenters and joiners, clerks,\r\ncoppersmiths, draughtsmen, electricians, fitters, harness-makers,\r\ninstrument repairers, metal-turners, painters, pattern-makers,\r\nphotographers, riggers, sail-makers, tinsmiths, turners, wheelwrights,\r\nwhitesmiths, wireless operators, wood-turners. Men of the following\r\nminor trades were also invited: cable-jointers, chauffeurs, drillers,\r\ndynamo attendants, electric-bell fitters, joiners' helpers, machinists,\r\nmotor fitters, plumbers' mates, switchboard attendants, tool-grinders,\r\nwiremen. Last, a welcome was promised to men above average intelligence\r\nwhose education at school had reached what is called the Fifth Standard.\r\nWhen an aeroplane glides down to earth as easily as a bird, and comes to\r\nrest, a chance onlooker would hardly guess what a world of intricate\r\nlabour and pains has gone to the attainment of that beautiful\r\nsimplicity. It is the workshop which gives safety in flight; and because\r\nthe workshop needs highly skilled men, whose services are in demand, at\r\nhigh wages, for many other purposes, an air force must always be\r\ndifficult and expensive to maintain in time of peace.\r\n\r\nCaptain F. H. Sykes was given the command of the Military Wing on its\r\nformation. His adjutant was Lieutenant B. H. Barrington-Kennett. Captain\r\nH. R. M. Brooke-Popham in March of that year joined the Air Battalion,\r\nand was serving at Farnborough when the Royal Flying Corps came into\r\nbeing. Most of the aeroplane company were then at Larkhill, but Captain\r\nC. J. Burke, with his B.E. machine, and Captain A. G. Fox, of the Royal\r\nEngineers, with a Bristol box-kite, were at Farnborough. Some of the\r\nofficers of the airship company were making strenuous and successful\r\nefforts to get the aviation certificates which were demanded from\r\nofficers of the new formation. In April and May about a dozen officers\r\nfrom various units joined at Farnborough. One of the first of these was\r\nCaptain Patrick Hamilton, of the Worcestershire Regiment, who had done\r\nmuch flying in the Argentine (and, incidentally, had been stoned by the\r\nhuman herd for refusing to give an exhibition flight in impossible\r\nweather). He was a keen and skilled aviator; he had made more than two\r\nhundred flights, and had had some narrow escapes--one particularly, when\r\nhis machine capsized and glided a hundred feet upside-down, at a sharp\r\nangle to the ground. By the two strong masts of the monoplane and by the\r\nbreaking of the machine he was preserved unhurt. He remarked that it was\r\na good lesson, for 'to an aviator experience is everything'. He brought\r\nwith him to Farnborough his two-seater Deperdussin monoplane with a\r\nsixty horse-power Anzani engine. Others who joined about the same time\r\nwere Major H. R. Cook of the Royal Artillery, who became instructor in\r\ntheory at the Central Flying School, Captain E. B. Loraine of the\r\nGrenadier Guards, Captain C. R. W. Allen of the Welch Regiment, Captain\r\nG. H. Raleigh of the Essex Regiment, Lieutenant C. A. H. Longcroft of\r\nthe Welch Regiment, and Lieutenant G. T. Porter of the Royal Artillery.\r\nA sort of class was held at Farnborough for these early recruits; they\r\nheard lectures, and did practical work in the overhaul of engines.\r\n\r\nThere were only four serviceable machines available at that time, one\r\nB.E., one Breguet, and two Bristol box-kites, so the recruits, who\r\nwanted above all things to fly, were disappointed. They were taken up in\r\nthe baskets of captive spherical balloons, where they spent hour after\r\nhour sketching the various parts of Farnborough, counting the cows on\r\nthe common, and writing descriptions of what they could see from the\r\nballoon. The labours of the pencil and the pen are not easily carried on\r\nin the basket of a captive balloon: it swings and twirls in a breeze,\r\nand very often produces air sickness. This form of instruction was\r\nrelieved by an ascent in the airship _Gamma_, and by occasional trips in\r\nfree balloons.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of April Captain H. R. M. Brooke-Popham took over from\r\nCaptain Fulton the command of the old aeroplane company on Salisbury\r\nPlain, and on the 13th of May, when the Royal Flying Corps was formed,\r\nthis company became No. 3 Squadron of the new formation. No. 2 Squadron\r\nwas formed from the nucleus of aeroplane pilots at Farnborough, and was\r\nplaced under the command of Captain C. J. Burke. In August the Central\r\nFlying School was started at Upavon, with Captain Godfrey Paine, R.N.,\r\nas commandant.\r\n\r\nThe airship company at Farnborough, being lineally descended from the\r\nold balloon school, became No. 1 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps\r\nMilitary Wing. The command of this squadron was given to one of the\r\nearliest of aeronautical pioneers, Captain E. M. Maitland, who, almost\r\nalone among the pioneers, preferred the airship to the aeroplane. Edward\r\nMaitland Maitland, after being educated at Haileybury and Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge, joined the Essex Regiment as a second lieutenant in\r\n1900. He served in the South African War, and in the spring of 1908\r\nturned his attention to ballooning. On the 18th of November in that\r\nyear, along with Mr. C. C. Turner and the late Professor A. E. Gaudron,\r\nhe ascended from the Crystal Palace in the _Mammoth_, a balloon of more\r\nthan a hundred thousand cubic feet in capacity, supplied by the\r\nenterprise of the _Daily Graphic_, and travelled in the air to Mateki\r\nDerevni in Russia, a distance of 1,117 miles, which was traversed in\r\nthirty-six and a half hours. His main interest was not in Russia, but in\r\nthe air, and he returned to England at once. When in 1919 he accompanied\r\nthe airship R 34 on the first famous air voyage across the Atlantic, he\r\nremained in America for only a few hours. During the years 1909 and 1910\r\nhe was attached to the balloon school at Farnborough, and carried out\r\naeroplane experiments at his own costs. He piloted a Voisin biplane in\r\n1909 at the Doncaster meeting, which, because it started the day before\r\nthe Blackpool meeting, may be called the first flying meeting in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn August 1910 he flew a Howard Wright biplane at Larkhill when there\r\nwere only two other machines there, namely, Captain Fulton's Bleriot and\r\nthe first biplane of the Bristol Company. On this occasion he crashed\r\nand broke both his ankles. When the Air Battalion was formed in 1911 he\r\nchose to work with airships, and was given the command of the airship\r\ncompany. His courage and gallantry were unfailing, and his parachute\r\ndescents were legion. When Professor Gaudron fell ill, and was prevented\r\nfrom giving his exhibition descents in a parachute at the Alexandra\r\nPalace, Captain Maitland took his place. He was the first to make a\r\nparachute descent from an airship; this was from the airship _Delta_, in\r\n1913. In 1915, for the purpose of experiment, he descended in a\r\nparachute liberated from a spherical balloon at a height of 10,500 feet.\r\nIn 1917 he jumped, with his parachute, from an airship over the sea at a\r\nheight of a thousand feet. He believed that the parachute is a\r\nnecessary adjunct to the airship, and that by practice and experience it\r\ncan be brought into safe habitual use. So he did not sit on a fence and\r\nwatch the thistledown, but took every opportunity that presented itself\r\nfor a parachute descent. One such opportunity he refused. When, on the\r\n24th of August 1921, he was killed in the disaster to the R 38, he spent\r\nhis last moments in endeavouring to check and control the fall of the\r\nairship. He was free from self-regard, and had the devotion of all who\r\nserved with him. His life, though it ended in its prime, was\r\nsurprisingly long, for he had made danger his friend, and in the\r\nadvancement of the cause to which he dedicated himself had welcomed\r\nevery risk.\r\n\r\nUnder Major Maitland's command the airship squadron--that is to say, No.\r\n1 Squadron--grew in strength and efficiency, but it was cut off in its\r\nyouth from the aeroplane squadrons. Expert opinion, which was divided on\r\nthe military value of airships, was united on their naval value. Not\r\nwithout protest the decision was made to hand over all the airships to\r\nthe navy, and at the close of the year 1913 this was done. An airship is\r\nmuch more costly than an aeroplane, whether to construct or to work, and\r\nwhen it flies at a moderate height for the purposes of military\r\nreconnaissance, it is much more vulnerable. This, no doubt, was the\r\nconsideration which determined the severance of the airships from the\r\narmy. Yet the airships, during their brief period of service with the\r\nMilitary Wing, had demonstrated in the most convincing fashion the\r\nenormous value of aerial reconnaissance, and, more important still, had\r\nput the whole Flying Corps in their debt by adapting wireless telegraphy\r\nto the uses of aircraft. The value of this work was not at once\r\napparent. The time before the war was spent chiefly in experiment.\r\nDuring the retreat from Mons no ground receiving stations could be\r\nestablished. But when the German rush was beaten back, and the opposing\r\narmies were ranged along a fixed line, wireless telegraphy became a\r\nnecessity for aeroplanes. The machines and the plant needed for this new\r\ndevelopment were not in existence; but a good deal of the preliminary\r\nwork, much more troublesome and uncertain than the multiplication of a\r\npattern, had been done. In a very short time there appeared at the front\r\nlarge numbers of machines fitted with wireless. The credit of this\r\nsudden apparition belongs, in part at least, to the Royal Engineers, and\r\nto their child, the balloon school, which by a steady process of growth\r\nhad been transformed into the airship squadron of the Royal Flying\r\nCorps.\r\n\r\nThe power of sending messages through space, in any direction, over\r\ngreat distances, is so enormous an addition to the utility of aircraft\r\nthat a few words must here be said about wireless telegraphy. The\r\ndiscovery was made by the gradual researches of men of science. These\r\nresearches had their beginning in a famous paper by James Clerk Maxwell,\r\nwho subsequently became the first professor of experimental physics at\r\nCambridge. His paper, _On a Dynamical Theory of the Electro-magnetic\r\nField_, read to the Royal Society in 1864, contains a theoretical\r\ndemonstration that electro-magnetic action travels through space in\r\nwaves with the velocity of light. Twenty-three years later, in 1887,\r\nHeinrich Rudolf Hertz, of the University of Bonn, published the results\r\nof his experiments in producing these waves by means of oscillating\r\ncurrents of electricity. His investigations confirmed what Clerk Maxwell\r\nhad proved mathematically. Thereafter progress was rapid, and during the\r\nclosing years of the nineteenth century the problem of subduing the\r\nwaves to the service of man was attacked and solved. In 1889 Professor\r\nOliver Lodge was measuring electrical radiation. At Liverpool\r\nUniversity College he constructed a Hertz radiator to emit the waves,\r\nand received them at various points of the building. Edouard Branly's\r\ninvention of the 'coherer', an instrument designed to receive Hertzian\r\nwaves, was communicated to the British Association at Edinburgh in 1893.\r\nDuring the same year Nikola Tesla published his researches on high\r\nfrequency currents; on these much of the later work on wireless\r\ntelegraphy was based. In 1895-6 William Rutherford set up at the\r\nCavendish Laboratory apparatus by which he received signals in distant\r\nparts of Cambridge up to a distance of half a mile from the oscillator.\r\nMany other men of science, among whom was Captain H. B. Jackson, of the\r\nRoyal Navy, were at work on the problem, when in 1896 Signor Guglielmo\r\nMarconi arrived in England with an apparatus of his own construction\r\nwhich ultimately brought wireless telegraphy to the stage of practical\r\nand commercial utility. By 1899 signals had been transmitted across the\r\nEnglish Channel.\r\n\r\nMan has no sense organs which record the impact of electrical waves, but\r\nhe has succeeded in devising instruments which register that impact, and\r\nwhich make it perceptible to the organs of sight or of hearing. The\r\noperation of the electrical waves may be best explained, perhaps, by the\r\nanalogy of sound. When the string of a piano is struck by its hammer it\r\nvibrates, and communicates its vibrations to the surrounding air; these\r\nvibrations, travelling outwards in waves, produce corresponding\r\nvibrations in the ear-drum of a listener. The string is tuned, by its\r\ntension and its weight, to a single note; the ear can adapt itself to\r\nreceive and transmit to the brain only a limited range of notes. There\r\nare many vibrations in the air which are too rapid or too slow for\r\nreception by the human ear. The sound-waves of the piano-string produce\r\ntheir effect on any neighbouring body which is capable of vibrating at\r\nthe same rate as the incoming waves, as, for instance, another string\r\ntuned to the same note, or a volume of air enclosed in a vessel which\r\nvibrates in correspondence. These are in 'resonance' with the vibrating\r\nstring; they repeat the original disturbance and reinforce its effect.\r\n\r\nSo it is with electricity. If the electricity with which any conducting\r\nbody is charged be suddenly disturbed, electrical waves are generated\r\nwhich travel outwards in all directions with the velocity of light. The\r\nproblem of wireless telegraphy is the problem of producing these waves\r\nby means of an instrument called a transmitter, and of recording their\r\nimpact at a distance by means of an instrument called a receiver. In its\r\nsimplest form the transmitting instrument consists of two conducting\r\nbodies, or plates, charged the one with positive the other with negative\r\nelectricity, separated from each other by air or some other insulating\r\nmaterial, and connected by a coil of wire called an inductance coil. To\r\nexplain the how and why, so far as these questions can be explained,\r\nwould involve a whole treatise on electricity; for the present purpose\r\nit is enough to say that when the two plates are connected through the\r\ncoil, the electrical discharge is oscillatory in character, as the\r\ncurrent runs to and fro between the one plate and the other, and that\r\nthese oscillations are radiated into space in the form of waves. The\r\nfrequency of the waves, the rapidity, that is, with which wave follows\r\nwave, depends on the size and proximity of the plates and on the length\r\nand form of the coil which connects them. The receiving instrument is\r\nsimilarly constructed, and can be so adjusted that the waves which it\r\nwould generate if it were a transmitter would have the same frequency as\r\nthose it is to receive. It is thus in resonance with the transmitter,\r\nand the effect of the incoming impulses is greatly enhanced.\r\n\r\nIf the waves produced are to be perceptible at any considerable\r\ndistance, the transmitting instrument must be capable of absorbing a\r\nlarge amount of energy and radiating this energy into space in the form\r\nof waves.\r\n\r\nThe storing capacity of the instrument is increased by having large\r\nplates close together, but its radiating properties are impaired if the\r\nplates are too close.\r\n\r\nThe chief advance made by Signor Marconi lay in his use of the earth as\r\none of the plates. In his wireless installation, a network of insulated\r\nwires, suspended in the air above, is one plate, the earth is the other;\r\nand the two are connected by an inductance coil. This device cannot be\r\napplied to aircraft, for obviously no connexion with the earth is\r\npossible. Both of the plates, or networks of wire, have to be carried on\r\nthe airship or aeroplane. No great weight could be carried on the early\r\ntype of aeroplane, and no great space was available.\r\n\r\nThis brief and imperfect description has been given in order to make\r\nclear some of the difficulties which attend the application of wireless\r\ntelegraphy to aircraft, and especially to aeroplanes.\r\n\r\nThe theory of flight was worked out by men of science in the laboratory;\r\nflight itself was first achieved by men who had had no systematic\r\nscientific training, but who endeavoured to acquaint themselves with\r\nscientific results, and to apply them, as best they might, to the\r\ndifficulties with which they were familiar in practice. So it was also\r\nwith the application of wireless telegraphy to aircraft. The men of the\r\nlaboratory were not familiar with all the conditions which had to be\r\nobserved, nor with all the unforeseen obstacles which present themselves\r\nin practice. It remained for those who knew the conditions and the\r\nobstacles to work out the practical problem for themselves. The\r\nvibration and noise, which make it difficult in an aeroplane to hear\r\nanything but the engine, the risk of fire, and the imperfect protection\r\nof the instruments from splashes of oil and the rush of the air--all\r\nthese things complicated the problem.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1907 Captain Llewelyn Evans, who commanded the 1st Wireless\r\nCompany of the Royal Engineers at Aldershot, lent his help to Colonel\r\nCapper of the balloon school in devising wireless communication between\r\naircraft and the ground. The apparatus had to be extemporized. The first\r\nexperiments were made by Lieutenant C. J. Aston, R.E., in a captive\r\nballoon. In May 1908 a free run was made in the balloon _Pegasus_, in\r\nwhich a receiving set of wireless had been installed. When the balloon\r\nwas over Petersfield, Lieutenant Aston received very good signals from\r\nthe Aldershot wireless station twenty miles distant. During the same\r\nmonth the sending of messages from the balloon was also tried with\r\npromising results.\r\n\r\nThese experiments soon came to an end. The time was not ripe for further\r\ndevelopments. No airships or aeroplanes were as yet in use in England,\r\nand all available energy had to be concentrated on producing wireless\r\ntelegraphy sets for the use of the army. In October 1909 Captain H. P.\r\nT. Lefroy, R.E., was placed in charge of all experimental work in\r\nwireless telegraphy for the army. This appointment he retained until the\r\noutbreak of the war. He had been commissioned in the Royal Engineers in\r\n1899, and had begun to study wireless at Gibraltar in 1905. Approaching\r\nthe question from the service side, he was able to do much to adapt\r\nwireless telegraphy to the new conditions presented by the conquest of\r\nthe air. As soon as the army airship _Beta_ was available he had her\r\nequipped with wireless apparatus, and on the 27th of January 1911 went\r\nup in her from Farnborough. Many messages were sent from the airship to\r\nthe ground station up to a range of thirty miles, and for a short time,\r\nwhile the airship engine stopped running, it was found possible to\r\nreceive messages from the ground. In the roar of the engine nothing\r\ncould be heard.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1911 Captain Lefroy spent much of his time in designing\r\na transmitting apparatus for aeroplanes. In January 1912 he went up with\r\nMr. Geoffrey de Havilland in the first B.E. machine, to test its\r\nsuitability for wireless. In May 1912 he set about fitting the same\r\nmachine, which was then being flown by Major Burke, with a generator\r\ndriven from the engine crank-shaft by bicycle-chain gear. These\r\nexperiments prepared the way for later achievement.\r\n\r\nIn the same year the Naval Wing of the Royal Flying Corps began to\r\nexperiment with a light wireless set for aeroplanes. As no machines were\r\navailable for fitting, a station was constructed on Burntwick Island,\r\nthe conditions being as nearly as possible the conditions in an\r\naeroplane. Stray signals were received from this station by H.M.S.\r\n_Actaeon_, about one mile distant. In June 1912 Commander Samson, flying\r\nthe first Short seaplane, fitted with a practice wireless set such as\r\nused in destroyers, succeeded in sending messages a distance of three,\r\nfour, and, on occasions, of ten miles. In August 1912 Lieutenant Raymond\r\nFitzmaurice, R.N., who had served as a wireless telegraphy officer with\r\nthe fleet, was appointed to arrange for the installation of wireless\r\napparatus in naval aircraft. A few days after his arrival at Eastchurch\r\nhe was ordered to go to Farnborough to take charge of the wireless in\r\nthe airship _Gamma_ on the defending side in the forthcoming army\r\nmanoeuvres. Captain Lefroy was to take charge of the wireless in the\r\nairship _Delta_, which was intended to operate on the attacking side.\r\nBoth these airships had been equipped with wireless apparatus by Captain\r\nLefroy, on instructions from the War Office, to ascertain what could be\r\ndone by wireless from aircraft in the manoeuvres. The set of wireless\r\nfor the _Gamma_ had to be improvised from odds and ends--an old magneto\r\nand some Moscicki jars. The 'aerial', which does the work of one of the\r\nplates of a condenser, was a double trailer of wire let down from the\r\nbottom of the car off two drums; the 'earth', which does the work of the\r\nother plate, was made of insulated wires triced out to the bow and stern\r\nof the gas-bag. The magneto was run by a belt from one of the ballonet\r\nblowers. Receiving instruments were also installed, but these could only\r\nbe used when the engine was stopped.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the weather was favourable the two airships sailed from\r\nFarnborough; the _Gamma_ for Kneesworth camp, on the defending side, the\r\n_Delta_ for Thetford, on the attacking side. The _Delta_ broke down over\r\nNorth London, but so successful was the wireless installation that her\r\nmessages reporting the break-down were received near Thetford and at\r\nPortsmouth by H.M.S. _Vernon_; the _Beta_ took her place, but was too\r\nsmall to carry the wireless installation. The _Gamma_ was thus the only\r\ncraft fitted with wireless, and the efforts of the attacking side were\r\ndevoted to intercepting her messages at a ground station. The _Gamma_\r\nwas an unqualified success. Her signals came in strong and loud from a\r\ndistance of thirty-five miles to a station at Whittlesford fitted with\r\nnaval service receiving apparatus. Speaking of the work of aircraft,\r\nGeneral Grierson, who commanded the defending force, says: 'The\r\nimpression left on my mind is that their use has revolutionized the art\r\nof war. So long as hostile aircraft are hovering over one's troops all\r\nmovements are liable to be seen and reported, and therefore the first\r\nstep in war will be to get rid of the hostile aircraft. He who does this\r\nfirst or who keeps the last aeroplane afloat will win, other things\r\nbeing approximately equal.... The airship, as long as she remained\r\nafloat, was of more use to me for strategical reconnaissance than the\r\naeroplanes, as, being fitted with wireless telegraphy, I received her\r\nmessages in a continuous stream and immediately after the observations\r\nhad been made.... It is a pity that the airship cannot _receive_\r\nmessages by wireless, but doubtless modern science will soon remedy this\r\ndefect.'\r\n\r\nThis was the first triumph of aerial reconnaissance in England. Every\r\nmorning the _Gamma_ went out at daybreak and scouted over the enemy;\r\nwithin half an hour the general in command was in receipt of very full\r\ninformation which enabled him to make out his dispositions and movements\r\nfor the day. Some attempts were made to conceal troops at the halt from\r\nthe view of aircraft; but, as General Grierson remarks, for troops on\r\nthe move there is only one certain cover--the shades of night. So\r\ncomplete was the information supplied from the air that the commander of\r\nthe defending force was enabled to organize his attack and end the\r\nmanoeuvres a day sooner than was expected. After the manoeuvres the\r\n_Gamma_ flew by night over Cambridge and bombarded that seat of learning\r\nwith Very lights. It took three hours to fly twenty miles, from\r\nKneesworth to Cambridge, against a strong head wind, and at one o'clock\r\nat night the mechanic informed Major Maitland, who commanded the\r\n_Gamma_, that only one-quarter hour's supply of lubricating oil\r\nremained. So the ship had to shut off her engines and float on the tide\r\nof the air. By throwing out all her ballast she kept afloat till dawn,\r\nand made a safe landing in the neighbourhood of Bristol. 'I don't think\r\nI shall ever forget', says Captain Fitzmaurice, 'the feeling of perfect\r\npeace and quiet one experiences when ballooning by night.' The same\r\nfeeling was experienced by Lunardi during his first ascent in a\r\nballoon. The history of aeronautics, if it could be fully written, is in\r\nthe main a history of Peace in the air.\r\n\r\nThe two years before the war were years of progress. In 1912 M. Lucien\r\nRouzet invented a transmitting apparatus which, in proportion to its\r\npower, was lighter in weight than anything that had previously been in\r\nuse; a number of these sets were purchased by the Naval and Military\r\nWings to be used in aircraft. During May 1913 successful wireless trials\r\nwere carried out by Lieutenant Fitzmaurice in a Short seaplane piloted\r\nby Sub-Lieutenant J. T. Babington. During one of these a flight was made\r\nalong the coast from the Isle of Grain to the North Foreland, the\r\nseaplane being in communication with the receiving stations at Grain and\r\nEastchurch and with ships at sea during the whole of its flight. Its\r\nsignals were read up to a distance of forty-five miles. During this\r\nflight the seaplane signalled a wireless salute to the Royal Yacht,\r\nwhich was taking the King and Queen to Flushing on a visit to Germany.\r\nIn the naval manoeuvres of the summer, Lieutenant Fitzmaurice and\r\nCommander Samson were sent out to scout over the sea due east from\r\nYarmouth in the latest Short seaplane, No. 81. Her engine failed, and\r\nshe was compelled to come down on the sea, but the wireless messages\r\nwhich she had sent to H.M.S. _Hermes_ served to locate her, and when the\r\n_Hermes_ went to look for her she was found near the expected place on\r\nboard a German timber boat which had come to her assistance.\r\n\r\nThe airships _Delta_ and _Eta_ were both equipped with wireless for the\r\narmy manoeuvres of 1913, and were based on Dunchurch, near Rugby. In\r\nall, _Delta_ sent sixty-six messages during her seven voyages, and on\r\nthe 24th of September carried out a successful night reconnaissance.\r\nThe _Eta_, owing to engine trouble, played no effective part in the\r\nmanoeuvres, but during her journey from Farnborough to Dunchurch she\r\nmaintained wireless communication with Aldershot till she reached\r\nWoodstock, when she called up Dunchurch and kept in communication for\r\nthe remainder of the voyage. Captain Lefroy in his report says: 'It\r\nseems probable that H.M. Airships _Delta_ and _Eta_ can exchange\r\nmessages with each other when 100 miles apart in the air, which may\r\nprove useful for organization purposes, &c. I received clear signals\r\nfrom the North Foreland station (and a ship to which she was talking)\r\nwhen 130 miles N.W. of it, and whilst H.M.A. _Eta_ was cruising\r\nnorthwards at touring speed.'\r\n\r\nJust before the 1913 army manoeuvres, Lieutenant B. T. James, piloting a\r\nB.E. aeroplane, succeeded in receiving wireless signals with the engine\r\nrunning at full power. To enable him to do this his machine was fitted\r\nwith Captain Lefroy's new receiving set in which magneto disturbances\r\nwere screened off and the signals strengthened by Brown relays, that is,\r\nmicrophones invented by Mr. S. G. Brown. In June 1914 Lieutenants D. S.\r\nLewis and B. T. James flew from Netheravon to Bournemouth each in a B.E.\r\naeroplane equipped with sending and receiving apparatus; they flew about\r\nten miles apart, and kept in close communication with each other the\r\nwhole way.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lefroy continued to act as wireless expert to the Royal Flying\r\nCorps up to the outbreak of the war. The work done by him and by\r\nLieutenant Fitzmaurice was of great value. When the war broke out\r\nwireless sets had been fitted to sixteen seaplanes, as well as to the\r\ntwo airships _Astra-Torres_ and _Parseval_, which did good service in\r\npatrolling the Channel during the passage of the Expeditionary Force.\r\n\r\nThe development of wireless telegraphy for the uses of aircraft was\r\nonly one small part of the work which had to be arranged and supervised\r\nby the headquarters staff at Farnborough. They had to recruit, organize,\r\nand train the new force. Energy, faith, and self-sacrifice were asked\r\nfor, not in vain, from the officers and men who came into the corps. The\r\nheadquarters staff was small, but with the help of the officers\r\ncommanding the squadrons and the staff of the flying school at Upavon,\r\nthey inaugurated a great tradition. There were no precedents. The staff\r\nhad first to invent their work, and then to do it. The details of supply\r\nand transport, the ordering of machines from the makers, the training\r\nand equipment of every recruit--all these things had to be thought out\r\nin advance. The official text-books, regulations, and standing orders,\r\nwhich were all complete and ready for issue when the war came, bear\r\nwitness to the foresight and initiative of Major Sykes and the small\r\nstaff who worked under him at headquarters. The Flying Corps resembles\r\nthe navy in this respect, that its daily work in time of peace is not\r\nvery much unlike its daily work in time of war, so that if the work is\r\nhard and incessant, at least it is rewarded by the sense of achievement.\r\n\r\nOne particular achievement was greater than all the rest. When flight\r\nbegan it attracted men of romantic and adventurous temper, some of whom\r\nwere much concerned with their own performances and had a natural liking\r\nfor display. If these tendencies had been encouraged, or even permitted,\r\nthey would have ruined the corps. The staff, to a man, set their faces\r\nlike flint against all such indulgences. Publicity, advertisement, the\r\nrubbish of popular applause, were anathema to them. What they sought to\r\ncreate was a service temper, and they were so successful that the\r\ntypical pilot of the war was as modest and dutiful as a lieutenant of\r\ninfantry. The building up of the Flying Corps on these lines, remote\r\nfrom the public gaze, deprived it of popular support, but it gained for\r\nit what was a thousand times more valuable--a severe code of duty, a\r\nhigh standard of quiet courage, and an immense corporate pride. To have\r\nkept the infant corps and all its doings in the public eye would have\r\nbeen as disastrous an experiment as to attempt to educate a child on the\r\nmusic-hall stage.\r\n\r\nA great part of the early work of the Flying Corps was experimental.\r\nVarious kinds of experiment were assigned by the corps headquarters to\r\nthe several squadrons, and the headquarters staff took care that any\r\nsuccess achieved by one squadron should become the rule for the\r\nbetterment of all. An experimental branch of the Military Wing was\r\nformed in March 1913 under Major Herbert Musgrave; it dealt, among other\r\nthings, with experimental work in connexion with ballooning, kiting,\r\nwireless telegraphy, photography, meteorology, bomb-dropping, musketry,\r\nand gunnery, and co-operation with artillery. Major Musgrave deserves\r\nmore than a passing mention in any military history of the air. After\r\nserving throughout the South African War as a lieutenant in the Royal\r\nEngineers he had passed through the Staff College. The possibilities of\r\naviation very early took possession of his mind. In 1909, from the\r\ncliffs of Dover, he saw M. Bleriot arrive in a monoplane, and was so\r\nimpressed by the sight that he went straight to the War Office to draw\r\nattention to the military significance of this portent, and its threat\r\nto our insular security. From this time forward his mind was set on\r\naeronautics. He applied for military aviation service before the Flying\r\nCorps was formed, and in May 1912 repeated his application. 'A Staff\r\nOfficer', he noted in his diary, 'should know the capabilities of\r\naviation. He should be able to observe from an aeroplane and to travel\r\nby aeroplane with dispatches.' At last, in October 1912, during a short\r\nperiod of leave, he learned to fly at the Bristol Flying School on\r\nSalisbury Plain. In the following spring he was gazetted a squadron\r\ncommander in the Royal Flying Corps. He was at once appointed assistant\r\ncommandant and officer in charge of experiments. His utility to the\r\nFlying Corps, while it was in the making, was immense. He urged that new\r\nsquadrons should be formed even while machines were lacking, so that the\r\norganization and discipline should be perfected in advance. The flying\r\ntraining of the corps, he insisted, should always have a clear military\r\npurpose in view. He was no militarist, but he was a good soldier, and he\r\nknew the imminence of war with Germany. As early as December 1911, in a\r\nlecture which he delivered in Malta, he predicted the war. 'When it\r\ncomes,' he said, 'be assured it will come suddenly. We shall wake up one\r\nnight, and find ourselves at war.... Another thing is certain. This war\r\nwill be no walk-over.... In the military sphere it will be the hardest,\r\nfiercest, and bloodiest struggle we have ever had to face; let us fully\r\nmake up our minds to that, and probably every one of us here to-night\r\nwill take part in it. We need not be afraid of overdoing our\r\npreparations.'\r\n\r\nFor two years Major Musgrave worked hard in helping to prepare the\r\nFlying Corps for its coming ordeal. In the spring of 1914 a headquarters\r\nflight was placed at his disposal for technical work in many kinds. Up\r\nto this time there had been two kinds of experimental work; the National\r\nPhysical Laboratory was responsible for purely scientific experiments,\r\nwhile the commanders of squadrons tested new ideas in practice. But\r\nthese two sets of men worked under very different conditions, and\r\nneither of them fully understood the aims and difficulties of the other\r\nbranch. The headquarters flight was intended to serve as a link between\r\ntheory and practice. Major Musgrave gave special attention to wireless\r\ntelegraphy, and with the assistance of Lieutenants D. S. Lewis and B. T.\r\nJames, both also of the Royal Engineers and both pioneers of wireless,\r\nhe made good progress in its practical application to the needs of the\r\nFlying Corps. When the war came, the headquarters flight was broken up\r\nin order to bring the four original squadrons up to strength, but the\r\nwireless section was attached for a time to No. 4 Squadron, and in\r\nSeptember 1914 a headquarters wireless unit was formed at\r\nFere-en-Tardenois in France, with Major Musgrave in command. From this\r\nunit the whole wireless telegraphy organization of the Royal Flying\r\nCorps was gradually developed. In December 1914 the unit was enlarged,\r\nand became No. 9 Squadron stationed at headquarters. Having worked out\r\nall details for the supply of wireless machines to the squadrons in the\r\nfield, Major Musgrave in March 1915 left the Royal Flying Corps to take\r\nup duty with the staff of the army. He was severely wounded in August\r\n1916. Almost two years later, on the night of the 2nd of June 1918,\r\nhaving persuaded a battalion commander to let him accompany a patrol, he\r\nwas killed by a rifle grenade, inside the German lines. He desired no\r\npersonal advancement, and would have thought no other honour so great as\r\nto die for his country. Such men, though the records of their lives are\r\nburied under a mass of tedious detail, are the engineers of victory.\r\n\r\nWhen the airships were handed over to the navy, it became necessary to\r\nreorganize No. 1 Squadron as an aeroplane squadron. This was put in hand\r\non the 1st of May 1914, and was not completed when the war broke out.\r\nThe senior aeroplane squadrons of the Military Wing were, therefore, No.\r\n2 Squadron under Major Burke, and No. 3 Squadron under Major\r\nBrooke-Popham.\r\n\r\nThe officers of these squadrons, to whom it fell to set the example and\r\nto show the way, were a remarkable group of pioneers. Some of them were\r\naccomplished flyers, who took delight in the mastery of the air. But\r\nnone of them practised the art for the art's sake. They were not\r\nvirtuosos, bent on exhibiting the heights to which individual skill can\r\nattain. They did not play a lone hand. The risks that they took were the\r\nrisks, not of adventure, but of duty. They were soldiers first. One and\r\nall they were impressed with the importance of military aviation for\r\ntheir country's need. 'It has got to come,' said Captain Patrick\r\nHamilton, 'and we have got to do it.' Their lives were pledged to their\r\ncountry, and until their country should call for them, were held in\r\ntrust, not to be lightly thrown away. Some were called early, during the\r\nexercises of peace; others during the war. Others again, a minority,\r\nwere marked down for a third chance, and were given the duty of carrying\r\non, through the war and after it. The time of the call, early or late,\r\nmade no difference; the work of the corps was not interrupted. When\r\nCaptain Eustace Loraine, the first to go, was killed with his passenger,\r\nStaff-Sergeant R. H. V. Wilson, near Stonehenge, on the 5th of July\r\n1912, the order was issued that flying would go on as usual that\r\nevening. An order like this not only creates a tradition, it pays the\r\nright honour to the dead, who died on duty no less than if they had been\r\nbrought down by the guns of the enemy. The casualties of the first\r\nsummer were not light in proportion to the strength of the corps, and in\r\none respect were very heavy, for almost all of those who were killed\r\nwere creators and founders, whose work and influence would have been\r\ninvaluable in building up the corps. They could ill be spared. They left\r\nnothing but their example; yet any one who remembers what the Flying\r\nCorps achieved during the war may well wonder whether that example does\r\nnot count for as much as a long life of devoted service.\r\n\r\nCaptain Eustace Broke Loraine had served with the Grenadier Guards in\r\nthe South African War. His great-grandfather was the famous British\r\nadmiral, Sir Philip Broke, who in 1813 commanded H.M.S. _Shannon_, and\r\nafter a fifteen minutes' battle outside the port of New York compelled\r\nthe surrender of the United States frigate _Chesapeake_. That battle, it\r\nhas been truly said, was won before it was fought; the _Shannon_ had\r\nbeen many years cruising at sea; she was in perfect fighting trim, her\r\nmen were disciplined and her gunners practised. The men of the\r\n_Chesapeake_ were fresh from the shore, strangers to each other and to\r\ntheir officers, so that the heavier armament of the _Chesapeake_ was of\r\nno avail. When Captain Loraine joined the Flying Corps he applied his\r\ngreat-grandfather's methods, and set himself by study, care, discipline,\r\nand skill to prepare the materials of victory. He was a highly skilled\r\npilot, perhaps overbold. The machine he was flying on the 5th of July\r\nwas the fast two-seater Nieuport monoplane on which Lieutenant\r\nBarrington-Kennett had achieved some records. It seems that he attempted\r\ntoo sharp a turn, lost flying speed, side-slipped, and nose-dived. He\r\nwas only a few hundred feet up, and there was no time to save the crash.\r\nThose who knew him believe that he would have done much for the Flying\r\nCorps. He spared no pains to understand his business, and to make theory\r\nand practice help each other. Staff-Sergeant Wilson, who was killed with\r\nhim, was the senior technical non-commissioned officer of No. 3\r\nSquadron, a first-class man, and a heavy loss.\r\n\r\nOther fatalities were to follow. On the 6th of September Captain Patrick\r\nHamilton and Lieutenant A. Wyness-Stuart, flying a hundred horse-power\r\nDeperdussin monoplane on reconnaissance duties connected with the\r\ncavalry divisional training, crashed and were killed at Graveley, near\r\nHitchin. Four days later Lieutenant E. Hotchkiss and Lieutenant C. A.\r\nBettington, flying an eighty horse-power Bristol monoplane from Larkhill\r\nto Cambridge, crashed and were killed at Wolvercote, near Oxford. A\r\ncommittee was appointed to investigate these accidents, and in the\r\nmeantime an order was issued by the War Office forbidding the use of\r\nmonoplanes in the Royal Flying Corps. This order altered the scheme for\r\nthe army manoeuvres, where it had been intended to allot a squadron of\r\nmonoplanes to one force and a squadron of biplanes to the other, in\r\norder to compare results. No. 3 Squadron, nevertheless, assembled near\r\nCambridge in such strength as it could muster; there were Major\r\nBrooke-Popham, Captain Fox, and Second Lieutenant G. de Havilland of the\r\nsquadron; these were joined by Mr. Cody, who came as a civilian with his\r\nown machine, and by officers of the Naval Air Service, who flew Short\r\nbiplanes.\r\n\r\nThe ban on monoplanes, it may be remarked in passing, was a heavy blow\r\nto one of the earliest pioneers of aviation in this country. Mr. L.\r\nHoward Flanders, who had worked with Mr. A. V. Roe at Lea Marshes, and\r\nhad designed the 'Pup' monoplane for Mr. J. V. Neale at Brooklands, had\r\nsubsequently formed a company for the building of aeroplanes, with works\r\nat Richmond. He obtained a War Office contract for four monoplanes, but\r\nwhen, after trial, he was engaged in reconstructing the under-carriages,\r\nthe use of the monoplane was forbidden to army pilots. This and other\r\ndisappointments put an end to Mr. Flanders's building activities, but\r\nhis name deserves record among the pioneers.\r\n\r\nWhen Lieutenant B. H. Barrington-Kennett of the Grenadier Guards became\r\nadjutant of the Military Wing of the Royal Flying Corps he made a vow\r\nthat the corps should combine the smartness of the Guards with the\r\nefficiency of the Sappers. In spite of difficulties and disasters, the\r\ncorps went far, in the first two years of its existence, towards\r\nattaining that ideal. In the summer of 1912 the Central Flying School at\r\nUpavon got to work, and thenceforward supplied a steady stream of\r\ntrained reinforcements for the corps. There was inevitable delay at\r\nfirst; but as soon as some of the new wooden buildings were nearing\r\ncompletion they were taken over, and on the 19th of June the school was\r\nopened. The plan was that there should be three courses every year, each\r\nof them lasting three months and passing on its graduates for further\r\ntraining either with the military squadrons or at the naval school. The\r\nfirst course began on the 17th of August 1912, and was not completed\r\nuntil the end of December, but the subsequent courses were punctually\r\ncompleted in the time prescribed. The delay in the first course was due\r\nchiefly to a shortage of machines. The use of monoplanes was forbidden,\r\nand the nineteen pupils who presented themselves in August had to be\r\ninstructed on the only four available biplanes, which were soon damaged\r\nby the maiden efforts of the learners. For a short time the pupils were\r\nsent on leave, and the school was closed; then new machines and new\r\nrecruits began to arrive, and the work of education went forward.\r\nBesides the main business of flying, the pupils were instructed and\r\nexamined in map-reading and signalling, the management of the\r\ninternal-combustion engine, and the theoretical aspects of the art of\r\nreconnaissance. Of a total of thirty-four pupils who were examined at\r\nthe end of the course, only two failed to pass. During the next year and\r\na half, up to the very eve of the war, the work of the school went on\r\nsteadily, with improving material and increasing efficiency. There were\r\nthree fatal accidents: on the 3rd of October 1913 Major G. C. Merrick\r\nwas killed on a Short biplane; on the 10th of March 1914 Captain C. P.\r\nDowner, on a B.E. biplane; and on the 19th of March 1914 Lieutenant H.\r\nF. Treeby, on a Maurice Farman biplane. On an average about thirty\r\nofficers passed out from the school, into one branch or another of the\r\nservice, at the end of each course. Most of these were army officers,\r\nbut there was also a fair number of naval officers, marine officers, and\r\nnaval volunteer and civilian reservists. The school was run on army\r\nlines, so that a good deal of adjustment and tact were called for in\r\ndealing with the navy pupils, who were accustomed to a more generous\r\nscale of allowances and a different system of discipline. But the\r\nresolve to make a success of the new air force prevailed over lesser\r\ndifficulties, and harmony was maintained.\r\n\r\nThe steady flow of recruits from Upavon soon enabled the Military Wing\r\nof the Royal Flying Corps to form new squadrons. These squadrons all\r\nstarted in the same fashion; they hived off, so to say, from the earlier\r\nsquadrons. As early as September 1912, a part of Major Burke's squadron,\r\nstationed at Farnborough, was detached, and became the basis of No. 4\r\nSquadron, commanded by Major G. H. Raleigh, of the Essex Regiment, who\r\nhad joined the Air Battalion just before the birth of the Royal Flying\r\nCorps. In August 1913 a single flight of Major Brooke-Popham's squadron\r\nbecame the basis of No. 5 Squadron, under Major J. F. A. Higgins. In\r\nJanuary 1914 No. 6 Squadron, under Captain J. H. W. Becke, of the Notts.\r\nand Derby Regiment, and in May 1914 No. 7 Squadron, which was commanded\r\nlater by Major J. M. Salmond, began to be formed at Farnborough.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Military Wing of the Royal Flying Corps before the\r\nwar may be best illustrated by a more detailed account of the doings of\r\nthe two earliest squadrons, commanded by Major Brooke-Popham and Major\r\nBurke. These showed the way to the others. There was no generally\r\nrecognized orthodox method of training flying men for the purposes of\r\nwar. Most of the work of the early squadrons was, in the strictest sense\r\nof the word, experimental. There was at first a vague idea, expressed in\r\nthe Army Estimates of 1912, that the Royal Aircraft Factory was\r\nresponsible for experiments, and that the squadrons had only to apply\r\nmethods and use machinery already tested and approved by others. But it\r\nwas soon found that the problems of the air could not be effectively\r\nanticipated in the laboratory. They were many of them soldiers'\r\nproblems. The man who is to meet the enemy in the air, and to be shot\r\nat, has a quick imagination in dealing with such matters as the\r\nprotective colouring of aircraft, their defences against enemy bullets,\r\nor the designing of them so as to give a good field of fire to any\r\nweapon that they carry; and he takes a lively personal interest in such\r\nquestions as stability, speed, rate of climbing, and ease in handling.\r\nThe ultimate appeal on the various devices, for the use by aircraft of\r\nmusketry, gunnery, photography, wireless telegraphy, bomb-dropping, and\r\nsignalling, must in the long run be made to the pilot. If he is\r\nprejudiced, and sometimes prefers a known evil to an unknown good, his\r\nhourly experiences and dangers are a wonderful solvent of that\r\nprejudice. It is not in the laboratory that the Derby is won, or the\r\nmanoeuvres and tactics of the air worked out.\r\n\r\nMajor Brooke-Popham's squadron on Salisbury Plain was the first to get\r\nto work. In its origin, as has been told, it was the old aeroplane\r\ncompany of the Air Battalion, so that it was free from some of the\r\ndifficulties which attend the creation of a new unit. It had at its\r\ndisposal about ten machines of various types, and, for transport, one\r\nMercedes car belonging to Captain Eustace Loraine and another belonging\r\nto the Government. Besides instructional flights and practice in\r\nreconnaissance, which were of course a regular part of the business of\r\nthe squadron, it devoted its attention at once to co-operation with\r\nother arms, and especially to the observation of artillery fire. It was\r\nfortunate in getting the whole-hearted support of Colonel the Hon. F.\r\nBingham, who was at that time commandant of the school at Shoeburyness,\r\nand chief instructor of the artillery practice camp at Larkhill. The\r\ngreat difficulty was to devise a sufficient method of signalling to the\r\nguns. Wireless telegraphy, which was destined to provide the solution of\r\nthis problem, was then at an early stage of its development, and the\r\napparatus was too cumbrous and heavy to be carried on the machines.\r\nExperiments were made with flags, with written messages carried back and\r\ndropped to the gunners, and finally with coloured Very lights. Progress\r\nwas slow. Only a small amount of ammunition was allowed to the gunners.\r\nOn windy days flying was far from safe; on calm days there was sometimes\r\nfog, or, if the weather was hot, the air became dangerously bumpy.\r\nNevertheless the squadron flew in strong winds, and took every\r\nopportunity of demonstrating to the troops on the plain that it was\r\nworth their while to cultivate relations with the new arm. Towards the\r\nend of May there was a big field day, and though the wind was almost a\r\ngale, four machines went up, flown by Major Brooke-Popham, Captain Fox,\r\nCaptain Hamilton, and by Major Burke, who had come over from Farnborough\r\non purpose. The important thing at this time, and for long after, was to\r\nshow the infantry what aeroplanes could do for them. At a later time,\r\nduring the war, it became necessary to teach the infantry what\r\naeroplanes could not do for them--that they could not, for instance,\r\nsupply them with a complete defence against enemy aircraft.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of August 1912 Military Aeroplane Trials took place on\r\nSalisbury Plain. These trials were competitions, arranged by the War\r\nOffice, to determine the type of aeroplane best suited to the\r\nrequirements of the army. One competition, with a first prize of L4,000,\r\nwas open to the world; the other, with a first prize of L1,000, was\r\nlimited to aeroplanes manufactured wholly, except for the engines, in\r\nthe United Kingdom. The judges were Brigadier-General Henderson, Captain\r\nGodfrey Paine, Mr. Mervyn O'Gorman, and Major Sykes. The tests imposed\r\nand the award of the prizes showed clearly enough that what the military\r\nauthorities were seeking was a strong, fairly fast machine, a good\r\nclimber, able to take off and alight on uneven ground and to pull up\r\nwithin a short distance after alighting. Further, a high value was\r\nattached to range of speed, that is, to the power of flying both fast\r\nand slow, and to a free and open view from the seat of the observer.\r\nBoth the first prizes were won by Mr. Cody on his own biplane, which was\r\nof the 'canard', or tail-first type, and was fitted with an\r\nAustro-Daimler engine of a hundred and twenty horse-power. The winning\r\nmachine did not in the end prove to be suitable for army purposes, and\r\nonly a few were ordered, but the trials gave timely and needed\r\nencouragement to the aeroplane industry. The army machines and the army\r\npilots were, of course, not eligible for these competitions, but the\r\nfactory machine B.E. 2 made a great impression on those who saw it fly.\r\nIt was in this machine that Mr. G. de Havilland, with Major Sykes as\r\npassenger, created a British record by rising to a height of 9,500 feet\r\nin one hour and twenty minutes. A few years later, when the war had\r\nquickened invention, a good two-seater machine could rise to that height\r\nin less than ten minutes. The only engine of British manufacture which\r\ncompleted all the trials was a sixty horse-power Green engine, fitted in\r\nan Avro machine.\r\n\r\nCertainly the British public did not know what was being done for them,\r\nagainst the real day of trial, by the handful of officers who foresaw\r\nthat that day would soon come, and who strove unceasingly to be prepared\r\nfor it. About two hundred members of Parliament came down to Salisbury\r\nPlain on the 8th of August to witness the competition of the aeroplanes\r\nin the Military Trials. The wind was judged to be too tempestuous for\r\nflying, and the flights were limited to a few short circuits round the\r\naerodrome in the afternoon. On the morning of that same day a brigade of\r\nterritorials, training at Wareham, asked for a couple of military\r\nmachines to co-operate with them. Major Brooke-Popham and Lieutenant G.\r\nT. Porter started off in an Avro, and, a little later, Captain Hamilton\r\nfollowed in his Deperdussin. The wind was so strong that Captain\r\nHamilton could make no headway, and was obliged to turn back. Major\r\nBrooke-Popham and Lieutenant Porter battled their way to Wareham, but\r\ncould not get farther to co-operate with the troops, and flew back to\r\nthe plain in the afternoon. On their arrival there they found that the\r\nwind had abated a little, and that flying had just begun in the trials.\r\nThe next day the newspapers published long accounts of the exhibition\r\nflying over the aerodrome, with a single line at the end recording that\r\n'military airmen also flew'.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of September No. 3 Squadron co-operated in the cavalry\r\ndivisional training, but without much success. The weather was bad, and\r\nthe cavalry, being preoccupied with their own work, had not much\r\nattention to spare for the aeroplanes. In France, a year earlier,\r\naeroplanes had been systematically practised with cavalry, sometimes to\r\ndirect a forced march, sometimes to detect dummy field works, prepared\r\nto deceive the cavalry and to lead them into a trap.\r\n\r\nBut if their co-operation with the cavalry was imperfect and\r\ndisappointing, the work done by aeroplanes a few days later, during the\r\narmy manoeuvres, was a complete vindication of the Flying Corps. There\r\nwere two divisions on each side; the attacking force, under Sir Douglas\r\nHaig, advanced from the east; the defending force was commanded by\r\nGeneral Grierson. The services rendered to the defence by the airship\r\n_Gamma_ have already been described. The fatal accidents of the summer\r\nand the consequent prohibition of monoplanes diminished the available\r\nforce of aeroplanes, but a squadron of seven was allotted to each side.\r\nMajor Burke's squadron, with its headquarters at Thetford, operated with\r\nthe attacking force; Major Brooke-Popham was with the defence at\r\nCambridge. Operations started at six o'clock on the morning of Monday,\r\nthe 16th of September. At a conference on Sunday afternoon, General\r\nBriggs, who commanded the cavalry on the side of the defence, told\r\nGeneral Grierson that the forces were far apart, and he could not hope\r\nto bring in any definite information till Tuesday. General Grierson was\r\nthen reminded by his chief staff officer that he had some aeroplanes.\r\n'Do you think the aeroplanes could do anything?' he asked of Major\r\nBrooke-Popham, and on hearing that they could, ordered them to get out,\r\n'and if you see anything, let us know.' Monday morning was fine and\r\nclear; the aeroplanes started at six o'clock; soon after nine o'clock\r\nthey supplied General Grierson with complete, accurate, and detailed\r\ninformation concerning the disposition of all the enemy troops. During\r\nthe rest of the manoeuvres he based his plans on information from the\r\nair. On his left flank there were only two roads by which the enemy\r\ncould advance; he left this flank entirely unguarded, keeping one\r\naeroplane in continual observation above the two roads, and so was able\r\nto concentrate the whole of his forces at the decisive point. In the\r\ncourse of a few days the aeroplanes rose into such esteem that they were\r\nasked to verify information which had been brought in by the cavalry.\r\n\r\nAir Commodore C. A. H. Longcroft, who flew in Major Burke's squadron on\r\nthe attacking side, has kindly set down some of his memories of this\r\ntime. The work of the Flying Corps, he says, was impeded by the enormous\r\ncrowds which used to collect round the hangars. But the weather was\r\ngood, and it was soon found that no considerable body of troops could\r\nmove without being seen from the air. To avoid observation the troops\r\nmoved on either side of the road, under the hedges. They even practised\r\na primitive sort of camouflage, covering wagons and guns with branches\r\nof trees, which, while they were on the road, made them more conspicuous\r\nthan ever. This first experience of moving warfare taught many lessons.\r\nThe difficulty of communication between pilot and observer when the\r\nvoice is drowned in the noise of the engine was met by devising a code\r\nof signals, and many of these signals continued in use throughout the\r\nwar, after speaking-tubes had been fitted to machines. The selection of\r\nlanding grounds when moving camp, the methods of parking aeroplanes in\r\nthe open, and the means of providing a regular supply of fuel, were all\r\nstudied and improved.\r\n\r\nIn another way these manoeuvres, which were witnessed by General Foch,\r\nwere a date in the progress of army aviation. No weapon, however good,\r\ncan be of much use in the hands of those who have not learned to trust\r\nit. The progress of the aeroplane was so rapid that the education of\r\ncommanding officers in its use became a thing of the first importance.\r\nSome of them, even when war broke out, had had but few opportunities of\r\ntesting the powers of aeroplanes.\r\n\r\nAfter the manoeuvres No. 3 Squadron returned to Larkhill, to do battle\r\nall the winter with the old difficulties. The officers were accommodated\r\nat an inn called the 'Bustard', about two and a half miles to the west\r\nof the Larkhill sheds; the men were at Bulford camp, three miles to the\r\neast of the sheds. After a time the men were shifted to the cavalry\r\nschool at Netheravon, which, though it was a little farther off, gave\r\nbetter quarters. Meantime a new aerodrome was being made, with sheds\r\ncomplete, at Netheravon, for the use of the squadron. The winter was\r\npassed in the old exercise of co-operation with the artillery and in new\r\nexperiments. At Easter a 'fly past' of aeroplanes took place at a review\r\nof a territorial brigade on Perham Down. General Smith-Dorrien, who\r\nreviewed the troops, took the salute from the aeroplanes. There was a\r\ncross-wind, so that the symmetry of the spectacle was a little marred by\r\nthe crab-like motion of the aeroplanes, which had to keep their noses\r\nsome points into the wind to allow for drift.\r\n\r\nSeveral officers joined during the winter, and the squadron began to be\r\nbetter supplied with machines. For the manoeuvres of 1913 it was made up\r\nto war strength both in aeroplanes and transport. These manoeuvres,\r\nhowever, did not give much opportunity to aeroplanes; the idea was that\r\nfour divisions, and with them No. 3 Squadron, should operate against a\r\nskeleton army. The squadron had next to nothing to observe; the other\r\nside had plenty to observe, but could not get full value out of their\r\nskeleton force. The tactics of the air had hardly reached the point at\r\nwhich a theoretic trial of this kind might have been of value. Yet a\r\ngood deal was learnt by the Flying Corps from these manoeuvres. Major\r\nBrooke-Popham drew up a very full report on them, and in the following\r\nwinter Lieutenant Barrington-Kennett, under the title 'What I learnt on\r\nManoeuvres, 1913', brought together the information he had obtained as\r\nadjutant from the talk and written statements of those who took part in\r\nthem. Both reports show a relentless attention to detail, and an\r\nunfailing imagination for the realities of war. The squadron had twelve\r\nmachines at work during the manoeuvres. Of these one was wrecked. Two\r\nhad to be brought home by road, one for lack of spare parts, the other\r\nbecause it had been taken over with a damaged engine--both avoidable\r\naccidents. The one wrecked machine, Major Brooke-Popham remarks, does\r\nnot represent the loss that would have occurred on a campaign. Four\r\nmachines had to land, and would have been captured in war. That is to\r\nsay, the loss amounted, to five machines in four days, or one-tenth of\r\nthe force every day.\r\n\r\nOne of the lessons learnt at the manoeuvres was that accurate\r\nobservations could be made from a height of at least six thousand feet.\r\nThis was one of those many things which, having been habitually\r\nridiculed by theorists, are at once established by those who make the\r\nexperiment. So high flying came into fashion, and brought with it a new\r\nset of problems concerning the effect of atmospheric height on the human\r\nbody and on the aeroplane engine.\r\n\r\nThe total mileage covered by the machines on divisional and army\r\nmanoeuvres was 4,545 miles on reconnaissance and 3,310 miles on other\r\nflights. Among the many suggestions made by Major Brooke-Popham for\r\nimproving the efficiency of the corps, some of the most important have\r\nbeen vindicated by the subsequent experience of the war. It is\r\nnecessary, he says, that the Flying Corps should be taken seriously by\r\ncommanders and their staffs. The work of the flying officers involves\r\nstrain and danger; it is not enough that they should be praised for\r\nskill and daring; they must feel that their information is wanted, that\r\nan accurate report will be used, and that failure to obtain information\r\nfrom the air will be treated as worthy of censure. If a squadron\r\ncommander finds that no one cares for the information he brings, he will\r\nkeep his machines on the ground in rough weather. On divisional\r\nmanoeuvres the Flying Corps were not always made to feel that they were\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nNo great stress, perhaps, should be laid on this complaint; it belongs\r\nto the early days of military flying, and its date is past. A new\r\ninvention is often slow in gaining recognition. When its utility is as\r\ngreat as the utility of flying a little experience soon converts\r\nobjectors. What was important was that the experience should be gained\r\nbefore the war. Observers in the early months of the war sometimes found\r\nit difficult to convince the military command that their reports were\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nThe value of information, says Major Brooke-Popham, depends also upon\r\nthe rapidity with which it is handed in to the proper quarters. 'More\r\nthan once movements of a hostile cavalry brigade were seen within a few\r\nmiles of our own troops. The information was not of great value to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, but was of great importance to the advanced guard or\r\ncavalry commander, yet by the time it had got out to him from\r\nheadquarters probably two hours or more had elapsed.' This delay was\r\nsometimes avoided on manoeuvres by dropping messages from the air, but\r\nthe whole large question of the relations of the Flying Corps to the\r\nvarious army commands and the organization of the machinery of report\r\nwas left until the pressure of war compelled an answer. Then, during the\r\nfirst winter of the war, when the growth of the Flying Corps allowed of\r\nmore complex arrangements, the machinery was decentralized, and\r\nsubordinate commanders were furnished directly with the information most\r\nneeded by them.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Barrington-Kennett's essay well illustrates his keenness and\r\nforesight in preparing the corps for their ordeal of 1914. He was a\r\ngreat disciplinarian, he knew every officer and man individually, he was\r\nuniversally liked, and he did more perhaps than any one else to hold the\r\ncorps together and to train it in an efficient routine. He knew--no one\r\nbetter--that the corps, though it did its work in the air, had to live\r\non the ground, and that its efficiency depended on a hundred important\r\ndetails. Here are some of his suggestions:\r\n\r\nLanding-grounds should be chosen, if possible, from the air, to avoid\r\nthe employment of numerous parties of officers touring the country in\r\ncars. The drivers of lorries and cars should be trained in map-reading.\r\nSemaphore signalling should be taught to all ranks, to save the\r\nemployment of messengers. There should be oil lorries for the\r\ndistribution of petrol, and leather tool-bags to be carried on\r\nmotor-bicycles to the scene of an engine break-down. Acetylene and\r\npetrol are better illuminants than paraffin for working on machines by\r\nnight. Experiments should be made in towing aeroplanes, swinging freely\r\non their own wheels, behind a motor-lorry; they are often damaged when\r\nthey are carried on lorries. Recruits for the motor transport should be\r\ntaught system in packing and unloading, and should be trained in march\r\ndiscipline. All recruits should be drilled in the routine of pitching\r\nand striking camp. All ranks should know something of field cookery. The\r\nmain lessons of the manoeuvres, the writer says, are first, that\r\nsubsidiary training in the business of soldiering is of enormous\r\nimportance; and, second, that responsibility must be regularly\r\ndistributed, and duties allotted, so that when the strain of war comes,\r\nthe whole burden shall not crush the few devoted officers who have been\r\neager to shoulder it in time of peace. The work of the pilots and\r\nmechanics of the British air service, he remarks in conclusion, is\r\nsecond to none; if only this work can be fitted into a solid framework\r\nof systematic administration and sound military discipline, the British\r\nFlying Corps will lead the world.\r\n\r\nThese are not the matters that a lover of romance looks for in a history\r\nof the war in the air. But they are the essentials of success; without\r\nthem the brilliancy of individual courage is of no avail. War is a\r\ntedious kind of scholarship. When Sir Henry Savile was Provost of Eton\r\nin the reign of Elizabeth, and a young scholar was recommended to him\r\nfor a good wit, 'Out upon him,' he would say, 'I'll have nothing to do\r\nwith him; give me the plodding student. If I would look for wits, I\r\nwould go to Newgate; there be the wits.' It was by the energy and\r\nforethought of the plodding student that the Flying Corps, when it took\r\nthe field with the little British Expeditionary Force, was enabled to\r\nbear a part in saving the British army, and perhaps the civilization of\r\nfree men, from the blind onrush of the German tide.\r\n\r\nThe work of Major Brooke-Popham's squadron, during these years of\r\npreparation, included a great diversity of experiment. With the progress\r\nof flight it began to be realized that fighting in the air was, sooner\r\nor later, inevitable, and in the winter of 1913 a series of experiments\r\nwas carried out at Hythe, by a single flight of No. 3 Squadron, under\r\nCaptain P. L. W. Herbert, to determine the most suitable kind of\r\nmachine-gun for use in aeroplanes. A large number of types were tested,\r\nand the Lewis gun was at last chosen, with the proviso that it should go\r\nthrough a series of tests on the ground. These took a long time, and it\r\nwas not till September 1914 that the first machines fitted with Lewis\r\nguns reached the Flying Corps in France.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of 1914 onwards, No. 3 Squadron also began a whole\r\nseries of experiments in photography; Government funds were scanty, and\r\nthe officers bought their own cameras. There was no skilled photographer\r\namong them, but they set themselves to learn. They devised the type of\r\ncamera which was used in the air service until 1915, when Messrs. J. T.\r\nC. Moore-Brabazon and C. D. M. Campbell brought out their first camera.\r\nThey would develop negatives in the air, and, after a reconnaissance\r\nwould land with the negatives ready to print. In one day, at a height of\r\nfive thousand feet and over, they took a complete series of photographs\r\nof the defences of the Isle of Wight and the Solent.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time there were a good many adventures by members of the\r\nsquadron outside the daily routine. The first night flight made by any\r\nofficer of the Military Wing was made on the 16th of April, 1913, by\r\nLieutenant Cholmondeley, who flew a Maurice Farman machine by moonlight\r\nfrom the camp at Larkhill to the Central Flying School at Upavon, and\r\nback again. Later in the year Commander Samson, of the Naval Wing,\r\nsuccessfully practised night flying, without any lights on the machine\r\nor the aerodrome; but as a regular business night flying was not taken\r\nin hand by the squadrons until well on in the war. During the month of\r\nJuly 1913 Lieutenants R. Cholmondeley and G. I. Carmichael became\r\nevangelists for the Flying Corps; they went on a recruiting tour to\r\nColchester, and gave free passenger trips to all likely converts among\r\nthe officers of the garrison there. Long before this, in 1912, the\r\nsquadron had begun to train non-commissioned officers to fly. The first\r\nof these to get his certificate was Sergeant F. Ridd. He had originally\r\nbeen a bricklayer, but after joining the Air Battalion had developed an\r\nextraordinary talent for rigging, and became an all-round accomplished\r\nairman. Others who were taught to fly soon after were W. T. J. McCudden,\r\nthe eldest of the four brothers of that name, and W. V. Strugnell, who,\r\nlater on, became a flight commander in France. The most famous of the\r\nMcCuddens, James Byford McCudden, V.C., who brought down over fifty\r\nenemy aeroplanes, joined the squadron as a mechanic in 1913, and became\r\na pilot in the second year of the war. In his book, _Five Years with the\r\nRoyal Flying Corps_ (1918), he says, 'I often look back and think what a\r\nsplendid Squadron No. 3 was. We had a magnificent set of officers, and\r\nthe N.C.O.'s and men were as one family.'\r\n\r\nThe other of the two pioneer aeroplane squadrons was formed at\r\nFarnborough in May 1912, and was put under the command of Major Charles\r\nJames Burke, of the Royal Irish Regiment. Major Burke rendered enormous\r\nservice to the cause of military flying. He took it up because he fully\r\nrealized the importance of the part it was destined to play in war. He\r\nhad served in the ranks in the South African War, and at the close of\r\nthe war was commissioned in the Royal Irish Regiment, becoming captain\r\nin September 1909. In 1910 he learned in France to fly a Farman biplane,\r\nand obtained the aviation certificate of the French Aero Club.\r\nThereafter he was employed at the balloon school, and in 1911 was\r\nattached to the newly-formed Air Battalion. He was something of a\r\nmissionary, and in that same year contributed two papers to the Royal\r\nUnited Service Institution, one on _Aeroplanes of To-day and their Use\r\nin War_, the other on _The Airship as an aid to the solution of existing\r\nstrategical problems_. On the formation of the Royal Flying Corps he was\r\ngiven command of No. 2 Squadron, which, after a time at Farnborough, was\r\nstationed as a complete unit at Montrose on the east coast of Scotland.\r\nHe brought his squadron to a high state of efficiency, and on the\r\noutbreak of war flew with it to France. There he did good service, till\r\nhe was invalided home in the summer of 1915 and became temporary\r\ncommandant of the Central Flying School. In 1916 he was again in France.\r\nThe war was taking a huge toll, and he rejoined his old regiment, which\r\nwas in straits for officers. In the previous year Major\r\nBarrington-Kennett, under the same pressure, had returned to duty with\r\nthe Grenadier Guards, and had been killed in action near Festubert.\r\nColonel Burke rejoined the Royal Irish Regiment in the summer of 1916,\r\nand was killed on the 9th of April 1917, on the first day of the Arras\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\nHe impressed those who knew him by his character. He was not a good\r\npilot, and was almost famous for his crashes. He was not a popular\r\nofficer. He was not what would be called a clever man. But he was\r\nsingle-minded, and utterly brave and determined, careless alike of\r\ndanger and of ridicule. There is often granted to singleness of purpose\r\na kind of second sight which is denied to mere intelligence. Major Burke\r\n(to give him his earlier title) knew many things about military aviation\r\nand the handling of a squadron which it was left for the war to prove,\r\nand which, even with the experience of war to teach them, some\r\ncommanding officers were slow to learn. A paper of 'Maxims' which he\r\njotted down as early as 1912 contains many wise and practical remarks.\r\nSome of them are of general application, as, for instance, these:\r\n\r\n_When things are going well, the man in charge can give play to his\r\nfears._\r\n\r\n_Nothing is ever as good or as bad as it seems._\r\n\r\n_If you know what you want, you can do your part, and get others to do\r\ntheirs. Most people don't know what they want._\r\n\r\nBut by far the greater number of them deal with aviation and its\r\nproblems. Here are some worthy of remembrance:\r\n\r\n_Time in the air is needed to make a pilot._\r\n\r\n_In training pilots, no machine should go out without knowing what it is\r\nto do, do that and that alone, then land._\r\n\r\n_No young pilot should be allowed out in 'bumps' until he has done\r\nfifteen hours' piloting._\r\n\r\n_An aeroplane will live in any wind and a lifeboat in any sea, but they\r\nboth want good and experienced men at the tiller._\r\n\r\n_When on the ground every one overrates his capacity for air work._\r\n\r\n_A squadron commander should want a good squadron, and not to be able to\r\nbreak records._\r\n\r\n_Waiting about on an aerodrome has spoilt more pilots than everything\r\nelse put together._\r\n\r\nThis last truth will come home to all pilots who have flown on the war\r\nfront. To have discovered it shows an instinct for command. Flying is a\r\nnervous business; there is no wear and tear harder on a war pilot than\r\nto be kept in attendance on an aerodrome, with the nerves at a high\r\ndegree of tension, and perhaps to be dismissed in the end. A skilful and\r\nimaginative commander will use all possible devices to avoid or diminish\r\nthese periods of strain.\r\n\r\nAny account of Major Burke would be incomplete if it contained no\r\nmention of his famous machine, the first B.E. This machine was\r\nfamiliarly known to the officers of the early Flying Corps, most of\r\nwhom--Sykes, Brancker, Brooke-Popham, Raleigh, Carden, Ashmore,\r\nLongcroft, and many others--had occasionally flown it. It was an\r\nexperimental two-seater tractor biplane, designed as early as 1911 at\r\nthe factory. At that time no funds were available for constructing\r\naeroplanes of factory design. This difficulty was overcome by an\r\nexpedient well known to all students of law. There was no money for\r\nconstruction, but there was money for repairs and overhaul. The first\r\nB.E. was created by the drastic repair and reconstruction of another\r\nmachine. A Voisin pusher with a sixty horse-power Wolseley engine had\r\nbeen presented to the army by the Duke of Westminster, and was sent to\r\nthe factory for repair. When it emerged, like the phoenix, from the\r\nprocess of reconstruction, only the engine remained to testify to its\r\nprevious existence, and even that was replaced, a little later, by a\r\nsixty horse-power Renault engine. It was now the B.E. tractor, and in\r\nMarch 1912, some two months before the formation of the Royal Flying\r\nCorps, it was handed over to the Air Battalion, and was assigned to\r\nCaptain Burke. It had a long and adventurous career, and was often flown\r\nat Farnborough for the testing of experimental devices. When at last it\r\nwas wrecked, beyond hope of repair, in January 1915, it had seen almost\r\nthree years of service, and had perhaps known more crashes than any\r\naeroplane before or since. It was frequently returned to the factory for\r\nthe replacement of the undercarriage and for other repairs. The first\r\nmachine of its type, it outlived generations of its successors, and\r\nbefore it yielded to fate had become the revered grandfather of the\r\nwhole brood of factory aeroplanes.\r\n\r\nMany of the records of the early work of No. 2 Squadron, commanded by\r\nMajor Burke, are missing. This was the first squadron sent out from\r\nFarnborough to occupy a new station, and to carry on its work as an\r\nindependent unit. It may safely be presumed that a great part of the\r\ntime spent at Farnborough was devoted to organization, and to\r\npreparation for the new venture. The shortage of machines was the main\r\nobstacle to early training. In May 1912 Captain G. H. Raleigh and\r\nLieutenants C. A. H. Longcroft and C. T. Carfrae were sent for a month\r\nto Douai in France, to pick up what knowledge they could at the workshop\r\nwhere Breguet machines were being constructed for the Flying Corps. They\r\nthen returned to Farnborough, where they began to practise cross-country\r\nflying. Much initial training was necessary before the squadron could be\r\nfitted for independence. In January 1913 it began to move north, by air\r\nand road and rail; by the end of February it was installed in its new\r\nquarters at Montrose. Five of the officers flew all the way: Captain J.\r\nH. W. Becke and Lieutenant Longcroft on B.E. machines, Captains G. W. P.\r\nDawes and P. L. W. Herbert, Lieutenant F. F. Waldron on Maurice Farmans.\r\nThe first stage of the flight was to Towcester on the 17th of February.\r\nOne machine, piloted by Captain Becke, arrived at its destination that\r\nnight. The others were stranded by engine failure, loss of direction,\r\nand the like. Lieutenant Longcroft had a forced landing at Littlemore,\r\nnear Oxford, and spent the night in the Littlemore lunatic asylum. By\r\nthe 20th all five machines had reached Towcester, and started on their\r\nnext stages--to Newark and York. At Knavesmire racecourse, near York,\r\npart of a morning was spent in writing autographs for boys, some of\r\nwhom, perhaps, may have become pilots in the later years of the war. On\r\nthe 22nd the squadron moved off for Newcastle. It was a day of fog and\r\nhaze; only two of the pilots found the landing-ground at Gosforth Park\r\nthat night, and these two had to land many times to get their bearings.\r\nThe directions given them would have been helpful to foot-travellers;\r\nbut turnings in the road and well-known public-houses are not easy to\r\nrecognize from the air. On the 25th the squadron moved to Edinburgh, and\r\non the following morning to Montrose. At both places they were\r\ntumultuously received and liberally entertained. The mechanics in charge\r\nof the machines and transport did their business so well, often working\r\nat night, in the rain, with no sort of shelter, that both the transport\r\nlorries and the machines arrived at Montrose in perfect order.\r\n\r\nAt their new quarters training in flight and reconnaissance was\r\nstrenuously carried on, and the squadron flew on an average about a\r\nthousand miles a week. Many non-commissioned officers and warrant\r\nofficers were instructed in aviation. Some thirty miles south of\r\nMontrose, across the Firth of Tay, there is a three miles stretch of\r\nlevel sand at St. Andrews, and this was used for instruction in\r\naviation--not without trouble and difficulty from the irresponsible and\r\nwandering habits of spectators. The more skilled of the pilots gained\r\nmuch experience in long-distance flying. All deliveries of new machines\r\nwere made by air. Inspecting officers and other visitors to the camp\r\nwere commonly met at Edinburgh in the morning, were then flown to\r\nMontrose to spend the day, and back again to Edinburgh in time to catch\r\nthe night mail for the south.\r\n\r\nIn August 1913 Captain Longcroft, with Lieutenant-Colonel Sykes as\r\npassenger, flew from Farnborough to Montrose in one day, landing only\r\nonce on the way, at Alnmouth. The machine was a B.E. fitted with a\r\nspecial auxiliary tank under the passenger's seat, and the time in the\r\nair for the whole journey was seven hours and forty minutes. In\r\nSeptember 1913 six machines of the squadron took part in the Irish\r\nCommand manoeuvres. The outward and homeward journeys by air, of about\r\nfour hundred miles each way in distance, including the crossing of the\r\nIrish Sea, were the severest part of the test. The manoeuvre area was\r\nbad for aviation owing to the scarcity of good landing-grounds and the\r\nprevalence of mist and rain. Moreover, the opposing armies were\r\nseparated by too small a distance to give full scope to the aeroplanes.\r\nThe principal battle took place in a mountain defile. Each of the\r\nmachines flew on an average about two thousand miles, that is to say,\r\nabout a thousand miles in reconnaissance, and about a thousand in the\r\njourney to and fro. There was no case of engine failure, and no one\r\nlanded in hostile territory. A statistical account of the work of the\r\nsquadron from May 1913 to June 1914 shows that, during that time, of\r\neighteen machines in constant use and subject to great exposure only\r\nthree were wrecked. This fact speaks volumes for the efficiency of the\r\nsquadron. They flew in all weathers, sometimes even when the wind was\r\nfaster than the machines. More than once 'tortoise races' on Maurice\r\nFarmans were organized; the winner of these races was the machine that\r\nwas blown back fastest over a given course.\r\n\r\nThe longest flight of all was made by Captain Longcroft in November\r\n1913. In the front seat of a B.E. machine First-Class Air Mechanic H. C.\r\nS. Bullock fitted a petrol tank of his own design, estimated to give at\r\nleast eight hours' fuel for the seventy horse-power Renault engine. On\r\nthe 22nd of November Captain Longcroft started on this machine, and flew\r\nfrom Montrose to Portsmouth and back again to Farnborough in seven hours\r\ntwenty minutes, without once landing.\r\n\r\nMajor Burke has left a diary for 1914; some of the entries in it go far\r\nto explain the causes of the efficiency of the squadron. No detail was\r\ntoo small for his attention; the discipline that he taught was the\r\ndiscipline of war. 'In practice,' he says, 'a man cannot always be on\r\nthe job that will be given him on active service, but he should be\r\ntrained with that in view, and every other employment must be regarded\r\nas temporary and a side issue. Further, though barracks must be kept\r\nspotlessly clean, this work must be done by the minimum number of men,\r\nin order to swell the numbers of those available for technical work and\r\ninstruction.'\r\n\r\nThe importance of the main issue was ever present to his mind. In\r\nanother entry he records how he reproved a young lieutenant, telling him\r\nthat 'he must take his work seriously and make himself older in\r\ncharacter'. Map-reading, signalling, propeller-swinging, car-starting,\r\nmilitary training, technical training, the safety of the public, the\r\nprompt payment of small tradesmen ('which defeats accusation of Army\r\nunbusinesslike methods'); these and a hundred other cares are the matter\r\nof the diary. That they were all subordinate to the main issue appears\r\nin the orders which he gave to some of the pilots of No. 6 Squadron, at\r\nDover, in the summer of 1914. Any pilot who met a Zeppelin, and failed\r\nto bring it down by firing at it, would be expected, he said, to take\r\nother measures, that is to say, to charge it. Not a few of the early war\r\npilots were prepared to carry out these instructions.\r\n\r\nThe work done by the other early squadrons was similar in kind. No. 4\r\nSquadron was formed at Farnborough in the autumn of 1912 under Major G.\r\nH. Raleigh, of the Essex Regiment, who had served with distinction in\r\nthe South African War. After completing its establishment it moved to\r\nNetheravon, where it carried on practice in reconnaissance, co-operation\r\nwith artillery, cross-country flying, night flying, and all the business\r\nof an active unit. The record of miles flown during 1913 by No. 4\r\nSquadron hardly falls short of the record of the two senior squadrons;\r\nall three flew more than fifty thousand miles. When No. 5 Squadron was\r\nformed under Major Higgins a part of it was stationed for a time at\r\nDover, and the squadron moved to new quarters at Fort Grange, Gosport,\r\non the 6th of July, 1914, a month before the war. No. 6 Squadron was\r\nnearly complete when the war came, but No. 7 Squadron was very much\r\nunder strength. Thus in August of that year four aeroplane squadrons\r\nwere ready for war, another was almost ready, and another was no more\r\nthan a nucleus. The rest of the magnificent array which served the\r\ncountry on the battle fronts was yet to make.\r\n\r\nThe month of June in 1914 was given up to a Concentration Camp at\r\nNetheravon. The idea of bringing the squadrons together in this camp\r\nseems to have originated with Colonel Sykes, whose arrangements were\r\nadmirable in their detailed forethought and completeness. The mornings\r\nwere devoted to trials and experiments, the afternoons to lectures and\r\ndiscussion on those innumerable problems which confront an air force.\r\nTactical exercises, the reconnaissance of stated areas in the search for\r\nparties of men or lorries, photography, handling balloons, practice in\r\nchanging landing-grounds, and the like, were followed by discussions of\r\nthe day's work. Lieutenant D. S. Lewis and Lieutenant B. T. James took\r\nevery possible opportunity, during the discussions, to urge the\r\ndevelopment of wireless telegraphy. In the speed and climbing tests the\r\ngreatest success was achieved by a B.E. machine fitted with a seventy\r\nhorse-power Renault engine. Much attention was paid to reconnaissance\r\nand to co-operation with other arms. There was a natural rivalry among\r\nthe squadrons. Major Burke's squadron was reputed to have the best\r\npilots, while the Netheravon squadrons had had more training in\r\nco-operation with other arms, and in the diverse uses of aeroplanes in\r\nwar. But the unknown dangers which all had to share were a strong bond,\r\nand the spirit of comradeship prevailed. The officers and men of the\r\nRoyal Flying Corps were makers, not inheritors, of that tradition of\r\nunity and gallantry which is the soul of a regiment, and which carries\r\nit with unbroken spirit through the trials and losses of war.\r\n\r\nThe single use in war for which the machines of the Military Wing of the\r\nRoyal Flying Corps were designed and the men trained was (let it be\r\nrepeated) reconnaissance. There had been many experiments in other uses,\r\nbut though these had already reached the stage of practical application,\r\nit was the stress of the war which first compelled their adoption on a\r\nwide scale. The Military Wing was small--much smaller than the military\r\nair forces of the French or the Germans--it was designed to operate with\r\nan expeditionary force and to furnish that force with eyes. Its later\r\ndevelopments, which added the work of hands to the work of eyes, were\r\nimposed on it by the necessities of war. Even artillery observation,\r\nwhich is the work of eyes, was at first no regular part of its duty.\r\nWhen the Germans were driven back from the Marne, and the long line of\r\nthe battle front was defined and fixed, the business of helping the\r\nartillery became a matter of the first importance.\r\n\r\nMany of the functions brilliantly performed during the course of the war\r\nby aeroplanes had been claimed, during the early days of aviation, as\r\nthe proper province of the airship. A wireless installation for\r\nreceiving and sending messages was too heavy for an aeroplane; it must\r\nbe carried by an airship. No sufficient weight of bombs could be carried\r\nby an aeroplane; the airship was the predestined bombing machine.\r\nMachine-guns were difficult to work from an aeroplane; they were the\r\nnatural weapon of the airship. Photography was a hope worthy of\r\nexperiment, but even photography was thought to be best suited to the\r\nairship, and internal accommodation for a camera was not asked for or\r\nprovided in an aeroplane. At the back of all this lay the strongest\r\nargument of all: the value of reconnaissance to the army was so great,\r\nand our military aeroplanes were so few, that it was impossible to spare\r\nany of them for less essential work. As the Flying Corps grew in\r\nnumbers and skill it found breathing space to look around and to claim\r\nthe duties that had been judged to be outside its scope.\r\n\r\nAs a nation we distrust theory. We learn very quickly from experience,\r\nand are almost obstinately unwilling to learn in any other way.\r\nExperience is a costly school, but it teaches nothing false. A nation\r\nwhich attends experience could never be hurried into disaster, as the\r\nGermans were hurried by a debauch of political and military theory,\r\nsubtly appealing to the national vanity. To insure themselves against so\r\nfoolish a fate the British are willing to pay a heavy price. They have\r\nan instinctive dislike, which often seems to be unreasonable in its\r\nstrength, for all that is novel and showy. They are ready enough to take\r\npleasure in a spectacle, but they are prejudiced against taking the\r\ntheatre as a guide for life. This is well seen in the disfavour with\r\nwhich the practical military authorities regarded the more spectacular\r\ndevelopments of aviation, which yet, in the event, were found to have\r\npractical uses. Looping the loop, and other kinds of what are now called\r\n'aerobatics', were habitually disparaged as idle spectacles. Yet the\r\n'Immelmann turn', so called, whereby a machine, after performing half a\r\nloop, falls rapidly away on one wing, was a manoeuvre which, when first\r\nused by the enemy, proved fatal to many of our pilots. The spin, at the\r\noutbreak of the war, was regarded as a fault in an aeroplane, due\r\nchiefly to bad construction; later on Dr. F. A. Lindemann, by his\r\nresearches and courageous experiments at the Royal Aircraft Factory,\r\nproved that any aeroplane can spin, and that any pilot who understands\r\nthe spin can get out of it if there is height to spare. During the war\r\nthe spin was freely used by pilots to break off a fight, to simulate\r\ndefeat, or to descend in a vertical path. Similarly, little stress was\r\nlaid, at the beginning, on speed, for speed was not helpful to\r\nreconnaissance, or on climb and height, for it was believed that at\r\nthree thousand feet from the ground a machine would be practically\r\nimmune from gunfire, and that reconnaissance, to be effective, must be\r\ncarried on below the level of the clouds. These misconceptions were soon\r\nto be corrected by experience. Another, more costly in its consequences,\r\nwas that a machine-gun, when carried in an aeroplane, must have a large\r\narc, or cone, of fire, so that the gun might be fired in any direction,\r\nup, down, or across. To secure this end guns had to be carried in the\r\nfront of a pusher machine, which is slower and more clumsy than a\r\ntractor. But the difficulty of accurate firing from a flying platform at\r\nan object moving with unknown speed on an undetermined course was found\r\nto be very great. The problem was much simplified by the introduction of\r\ndevices for firing a fixed machine-gun through the tractor screw, so\r\nthat the pilot could aim his gun by aiming his aeroplane, or\r\ngun-platform, which responds delicately and quickly to his control.\r\n\r\nWhen the war began we were not inferior in aerodynamical knowledge to\r\nthe Germans or even to the French. Speaking at the Aeronautical Society\r\nin February 1914, Brigadier-General Henderson said, 'If any one wants to\r\nknow which country has the fastest aeroplane in the world--it is Great\r\nBritain'. This was the S.E. 4, a forerunner of the more famous S.E. 5.\r\nIf more powerful engines had been installed in the British machines of\r\n1914, they would have given us a speed that the enemy could not touch.\r\nBut we were preoccupied with the needs of reconnaissance, and we cared\r\nlittle about speed. In the early part of the war we hampered our\r\naeroplanes with fitments, cameras, and instruments, which were attached\r\nas protuberances to the streamlined body of the aeroplane and made speed\r\nimpossible. In the Flying Corps itself an aeroplane thus fitted was\r\ncommonly called a Christmas tree. We thought too little of power in the\r\nengine, a mistake not quickly remedied, seeing that the time which must\r\nelapse between the ordering of an engine and its production in quantity\r\nis, even under pressure, a period of about twelve months. The engines\r\navailable at the outbreak of the war for British military aircraft were\r\nthe seventy horse-power Renault and the eighty horse-power Gnome. In\r\nGermany airship engines of two hundred horse-power and more, easily\r\nmodified for use in aeroplanes, were available in quantity some time\r\nbefore the war. For military machines we were satisfied with smaller\r\nengines, which worked well, and enabled our aeroplanes to accomplish all\r\nthat at that time seemed likely to be asked of them. If we were wrong we\r\nwere content to wait for experience to correct us.\r\n\r\nThe problems presented to the Naval Wing of the Royal Flying Corps were\r\nwidely different from those which engrossed the attention of the\r\nsoldiers. The difference, to put it briefly, was the difference between\r\ndefence and attack. The British army does not fight at home, and this\r\nprivilege it enjoys by virtue of the constant vigilance of the British\r\nnavy. The ultimate business of the British navy, though it visits all\r\nthe seas of the world, is home defence. Yet that defence cannot be\r\neffectively carried out at home, and when we are at war our frontiers\r\nare the enemy coasts and our best defence is attack. This old\r\nestablished doctrine of naval warfare is the orthodox doctrine also of\r\naerial warfare. A mobile force confined to one place by losing its\r\nmobility loses most of its virtue. The fencer who does nothing but parry\r\ncan never win a bout, and in the end will fail to parry. The recognition\r\nof this doctrine in relation to aerial warfare was gradual. When the\r\nRoyal Flying Corps was established and the question of the defence of\r\nour coasts by aircraft first came under discussion, our available\r\nairships, aeroplanes, and seaplanes, though their development had been\r\namazingly rapid, were weapons without much power of offence. The main\r\nthing was to give them a chance of proving and increasing their utility.\r\nIn October 1912 the Admiralty decided to establish a chain of seaplane\r\nand airship stations on the east coast of Great Britain. The earliest of\r\nthese stations, after Eastchurch, was the seaplane station of the Isle\r\nof Grain, commissioned in December 1912, with Lieutenant J. W. Seddon as\r\nofficer in command. This was followed, in the first half of 1913, by the\r\nestablishment of similar stations at Calshot, Felixstowe, Yarmouth, and\r\nCromarty. H.M.S. _Hermes_, in succession to H.M.S. _Actaeon_, was\r\ncommissioned on the 7th of May 1913 as headquarters of the Naval Wing,\r\nand her commanding officer, Captain G. W. Vivian, R.N., was given charge\r\nof all coastal air stations. For airships a station at Hoo on the Medway\r\nwas established with two double sheds of the largest size; it was called\r\nKingsnorth, and was completed in April 1914, by which time all military\r\nairships had been handed over to the Admiralty. All the seaplane\r\nstations were in a sense offshoots of Eastchurch, which continued to be\r\nthe principal naval flying school. Except for some valuable experimental\r\nwork, not very much was done before the war at the seaplane coast\r\nstations. The supply of machines was small, and when the bare needs of\r\nEastchurch and Grain had been met, not enough remained for the outfit of\r\nthe other stations. Nevertheless the zeal of the naval pilots,\r\nencouraged and supported by the First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. Winston\r\nChurchill) and by the Director of the Air Department (Captain Murray\r\nSueter), wrought good progress in a short time. The first successful\r\nseaplane was produced at Eastchurch, as has been told, in March 1912.\r\nJust before the war, the Naval Wing of the Royal Flying Corps had in its\r\npossession fifty-two seaplanes, of which twenty-six were in flying\r\ncondition, and further, had forty-six seaplanes on order. Those who know\r\nhow difficult it is to get new things done will easily recognize that\r\nthis measure of progress, though perhaps not very impressive\r\nnumerically, could never have been achieved save by indomitable\r\nperseverance and effort. Sailors are accustomed to work hard and\r\ncheerfully under adverse conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the naval manoeuvres of July 1913 the _Hermes_, carrying two\r\nseaplanes, which were flown from its launching platform, operated with\r\nthe fleet. Four seaplanes and one aeroplane from Yarmouth, three\r\nseaplanes from Leven, and three from Cromarty, also bore a part. The\r\nweather was not good, and the manoeuvres proved that the smaller type of\r\nseaplane was useless for work in the North Sea. Any attempt to get these\r\nmachines off the water in a North Sea 'lop' infallibly led to their\r\ndestruction. Further, it was found necessary for the safety of pilots\r\nthat every machine should be fitted with wireless telegraphy. A machine\r\nfitted with folding wings was flown from the _Hermes_ by Commander\r\nSamson, and was found to be the best and most manageable type.\r\n\r\nIn a minute dated the 26th of October 1913 the First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty sketches a policy and a programme for the ensuing years.\r\nAeroplanes and seaplanes, he remarks, are needed by the navy for oversea\r\nwork and for home work. He recommends three new types of machine: first,\r\nan oversea fighting seaplane, to operate from a ship as base; next, a\r\nscouting seaplane, to work with the fleet at sea; and last, a\r\nhome-service fighting aeroplane, to repel enemy aircraft when they\r\nattack the vulnerable points of our island, and to carry out patrol\r\nduties along the coast. The events of the war have given historic\r\ninterest to all forecasts prepared before the war. Mr. Churchill's\r\nminute is naturally much concerned with the Zeppelin, which should be\r\nattacked, he says, by an aeroplane descending on it obliquely from\r\nabove, and discharging a series of small bombs or fireballs, at rapid\r\nintervals, so that a string of them, more than a hundred yards in\r\nlength, would be drawn like a whiplash across the gas-bag. This is a\r\nnear anticipation of the method by which Flight Sub-Lieutenant R. A. J.\r\nWarneford brought down a Zeppelin in flames between Ghent and Brussels\r\non the 7th of June 1915. The immense improvements in construction which\r\nwere wrought by the war may be measured by Mr. Churchill's\r\nspecifications for the rate of climb of the two-seater aeroplanes and\r\nseaplanes--namely, three thousand feet in twenty minutes. When he\r\ndrafted his scheme that was a good rate of climb; before the war ended\r\nthere were machines on the flying fronts which could climb three\r\nthousand feet in two minutes.\r\n\r\nUnder the direction of the Air Department much attention was paid by\r\npilots in the Naval Air Service to experimental work and the diverse\r\nuses of aeroplanes. So early as January 1912 Lieutenant H. A.\r\nWilliamson, R.N., a submarine officer who had gained the Royal Aero Club\r\ncertificate, submitted to the Admiralty a paper which anticipated some\r\nlater successes. He advocated the use of aeroplanes operating from a\r\nparent ship for the detection of submarines, and showed how bombs\r\nexploding twenty feet below the surface might be used to destroy these\r\ncraft. The practical introduction of depth charges was delayed for years\r\nby the difficulty of devising the delicate and accurate mechanism which\r\nuses the pressure of the water to explode the bomb at a given depth. But\r\nbefore the war ended the detection of submarines from the air and the\r\nuse by surface craft of depth charges for destroying them had been\r\nbrought to such a degree of efficiency that the submarine menace was\r\ncountered and held. The submarine learned to fear aircraft as the birds\r\nof the thicket fear the hawk. It would be tedious to attempt to describe\r\nthe long series of experiments by which this result was at last\r\nattained. The earliest attempts to detect submarines from the air were\r\nmade with seaplanes at Harwich in June 1912, and at Rosyth in September\r\nof the same year. The shallow tidal waters were found to be very opaque,\r\nbut in clear weather a periscope could be seen from a considerable\r\ndistance, and in misty weather the seaplane, when it sighted a submarine\r\nin diving trim on the surface, could swoop down and drop a bomb before\r\nthe submarine could dive.\r\n\r\nProgress in bomb-dropping was not less. Nothing is easier than to drop a\r\ndetonating bomb, with good intentions, over the side of an aeroplane;\r\nthe difficulty of hitting the mark lay in determining the flight of the\r\nbomb and in devising an efficient dropping gear. To drop a weight from a\r\nrapidly moving aeroplane so that it shall hit a particular spot on the\r\nsurface of the earth is not an easy affair; the pace and direction of\r\nthe machine, its height from the ground, the shape and air resistance of\r\nthe bomb, must all be accurately known. They cannot be calculated in the\r\nair; success in bomb-dropping depends on the designing of a gear for\r\ndropping and sighting which shall perform these calculations\r\nautomatically. Very early in the history of aviation dummy bombs had\r\nbeen dropped, for spectacular purposes, at targets marked on the ground.\r\nThe designing of an efficient dropping gear and the study of the flight\r\nof bombs were taken up by the Air Department of the Admiralty from the\r\nvery first. Under their direction a very valuable series of experiments\r\nwas carried out at Eastchurch, at first by Commander Samson, and later\r\nby Lieutenant R. H. Clark Hall, a naval gunnery lieutenant, who had\r\nlearnt to fly, and was appointed in March 1913 for armament duties with\r\nthe Royal Naval Air Service.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject was new. No one could tell exactly how the flight of\r\nan aeroplane would be affected when the weight of the machine should be\r\nsuddenly lightened by the release of a large bomb; no one could be sure\r\nthat a powerful explosion on the surface of the sea would not affect the\r\nmachine flying at a moderate height above it. In 1912 a dummy\r\nhundred-pound bomb was dropped from a Short pusher biplane flown by\r\nCommander Samson, who was surprised and pleased to find that the effect\r\non the flight of the machine was hardly noticeable. In December 1913\r\nexperiments were carried out to determine the lowest height at which\r\nbombs could be safely dropped from an aeroplane. No heavy bombs were\r\navailable, but floating charges of various weights, from 2-1/4 pounds to\r\n40 pounds, were fired electrically from a destroyer, while Maurice\r\nFarman seaplanes flew at various heights directly above the explosion.\r\nAgain the effect upon the machines was less than had been anticipated.\r\nThe general conclusion was that an aeroplane flying at a height of 350\r\nfeet or more could drop a hundred-pound bomb, containing forty pounds of\r\nhigh explosive, without danger from the air disturbance caused by the\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\nA good war machine aims at combining the safety of the operator with a\r\nhigh degree of danger to the victim. The second of these requirements\r\nwas the more difficult of fulfilment, and was the subject of many\r\nexperiments. Until the war took the measure of their powers, the German\r\nZeppelins preoccupied attention, and were regarded as the most important\r\ntargets for aerial attack. The towing of an explosive grapnel, which,\r\nsuspended from an aeroplane, should make contact with the side of an\r\nairship, was the subject of experiments at Eastchurch. This idea,\r\nthough nothing occurred to prove it impracticable, was soon abandoned\r\nin favour of simpler methods--the dropping, for instance, of a series of\r\nlight bombs with sensitive fuses, or the firing of Hales grenades from\r\nan ordinary service rifle. To make these effective, it was essential\r\nthat they should detonate on contact with ordinary balloon fabric, and\r\npreliminary experiments were carried out at the Cotton Powder Company's\r\nworks at Faversham in October 1913.\r\n\r\nWhen two sheets of fabric, stitched on frames to represent the two skins\r\nof a rigid airship, were hit by a grenade of the naval type with a\r\nfour-ounce charge, it was found that the front sheet was blown to shreds\r\nand the rear sheet had a hole about half a foot in diameter blown in it.\r\nLater experiments at Farnborough against balloons filled with hydrogen,\r\nand made to resemble as nearly as possible a section of a rigid airship,\r\nwere completely successful. Firing at floating targets, and at small\r\ntarget balloons released from the aeroplanes, was practised at\r\nEastchurch. It was found that, with no burst or splash to indicate where\r\nthe shot hit, this practice was unprofitable. The effective use of\r\nsmall-bore fire-arms against aircraft was made possible by two\r\ninventions, produced under the stress of the war itself, that is to say,\r\nof the tracer bullet, which leaves behind it in the air a visible track\r\nof its flight, and of the incendiary bullet, which sets fire to anything\r\ninflammable that it hits.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of war the only effective weapon for attacking the\r\nZeppelin from the air was the Hales grenade. Of two hundred of these\r\nwhich had been manufactured for the use of the Naval Wing many had been\r\nused in experiment; the remainder were hastily distributed by Lieutenant\r\nClark Hall among the seaplane stations on the East Coast.\r\n\r\nThe Naval Air Service experimented also with the mounting of\r\nmachine-guns on aeroplanes. On this matter Lieutenant Clark Hall, early\r\nin 1914, reported as follows:\r\n\r\n'Machine-gun aeroplanes are (or will be) required to drive off enemy\r\nmachines approaching our ports with the intention of obtaining\r\ninformation or attacking with bombs our magazines, oil tanks, or\r\ndockyards.... I do not think the present state of foreign seaplanes for\r\nattack or scouting over our home ports is such as to make the question\r\nextremely urgent, but I would strongly advocate having by the end of\r\n1914 at each of our home ports and important bases at least two\r\naeroplanes mounting machine-guns for the sole purpose of beating off or\r\ndestroying attacking or scouting enemy aeroplanes.'\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it is evident that the Naval Wing of the Royal\r\nFlying Corps paid more attention than was paid by the Military Wing to\r\nthe use of the aeroplane as a fighting machine. This difference\r\nnaturally followed from the diverse tasks to be performed by the two\r\nbranches of the air service. The Military Wing, small as it was, knew\r\nthat it would be entrusted with the immense task of scouting for the\r\nexpeditionary force, and that its business would be rather to avoid than\r\nto seek battle in the air. The Naval Wing, being entrusted first of all\r\nwith the defence of the coast, aimed at doing something more than\r\nobserving the movements of an attacking enemy. Thus in bomb-dropping and\r\nin machine-gunnery the Naval Wing was more advanced than the Military\r\nWing. Both wings were active and alive with experiment, so that after a\r\nwhile experimental work which had originally been assigned to the\r\nfactory and the Central Flying School was transferred to the Wing\r\nHeadquarters. During the year 1913 wireless experiments were\r\ndiscontinued at the Central Flying School, and were concentrated at the\r\nMilitary Wing. There was a valuable measure of co-operation between the\r\ntwo wings. This co-operation was conspicuous, as has been seen, in\r\nwireless telegraphy, which was first applied to aircraft at Farnborough.\r\nThe lighter-than-air craft, which belonged first to the army and then to\r\nthe navy, were a valuable link between the two wings. Each wing was\r\nready to learn from the other. In January 1914, by permission of the\r\nAdmiralty, officers of the Military Wing witnessed the experiments made\r\nby the Naval Wing with bomb-dropping gear. If the Naval Wing in some\r\nrespects made more material progress, it should be remembered that they\r\nreceived more material support. They were encouraged by the\r\nindefatigable Director of the Air Department, and received from the\r\nAdmiralty larger grants of money than came to the Military Wing. No\r\ndoubt a certain spirit of rivalry made itself felt. Service loyalty is a\r\nstrong passion, and the main tendency, before the war, was for the two\r\nbranches of the air service to drift apart, and to attach themselves\r\nclosely, the one to the army, the other to the navy.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1913 H.M.S. _Hermes_ was paid off, and the headquarters of\r\nthe Naval Wing was transferred to the Central Air Office, Sheerness. All\r\nranks and ratings hitherto borne on the books of the _Hermes_ were\r\ntransferred to the books of this newly created office, and Captain F. R.\r\nScarlett, R.N., late second in command of the _Hermes_, was placed in\r\ncharge, with the title of Inspecting Captain of Aircraft. He was\r\nresponsible to the Director of the Air Department, and, in regard to\r\naircraft carried on ships afloat, or operating with the fleet, was also\r\ndirectly responsible to the Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleets. In\r\nsome respects the progress made by the Naval Wing of the Royal Flying\r\nCorps during 1913 had been continuous and satisfactory. Training had\r\nbeen carried on regularly at the Central Flying School, at Eastchurch,\r\nand, for airship work, at Farnborough. By the end of the year there\r\nwere about a hundred trained pilots. Stations for guarding the coast had\r\nbeen established in five places other than Eastchurch, and arrangements\r\nwere in hand for doubling this number. The record of miles flown during\r\nthe year by naval aeroplanes and seaplanes was no less than 131,081\r\nmiles. Wireless telegraphy had made a great advance; transmitting sets\r\nwere in course of being fitted to all seaplanes, and the reception of\r\nmessages in aeroplanes had been experimentally obtained. Systematic\r\nbomb-dropping had been practised with growing accuracy and success. A\r\nsystem for transmitting meteorological charts from the Admiralty, so\r\nthat air stations and aircraft in the air should receive frequent\r\nstatements of the weather conditions, had been brought into working\r\norder.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, all these advances were experimental in character,\r\nand no attempt had been made to equip the force completely for the needs\r\nof war. In this matter there is perhaps something to be said on both\r\nsides. Where munitions are improving every year, too soon is almost as\r\nbad as too late. In fact, at the beginning of the war the Naval Air\r\nService had only two aeroplanes and one airship fitted with\r\nmachine-guns. Of the aeroplanes, one carried a Maxim gun, another a\r\nLewis gun, loaned to the Admiralty by Colonel Lucas, C.B., of Hobland\r\nHall, Yarmouth. No. 3 Airship (the _Astra-Torres_) was fitted with a\r\nHotchkiss gun. The offensive weapon carried by other machines was a\r\nrifle. The various air stations were not liberally supplied with\r\nmunitions of war. The Isle of Grain had four Hales hand-grenades. Hendon\r\n(the station for the defence of London) and Felixstowe had twelve each.\r\nThe other stations were supplied in a like proportion, except\r\nEastchurch, which had a hundred and fifty hand-grenades, forty-two rifle\r\ngrenades, twenty-six twenty-pound bombs, and a Maxim gun. When the war\r\nbroke out, a number of six-inch shells were fitted with tail vanes and\r\nconverted into bombs.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of July 1914 the separate existence of the naval air force\r\nwas officially recognized. The Naval Wing of the Royal Flying Corps\r\nbecame the Royal Naval Air Service, with a constitution of its own. The\r\nnaval flying school at Eastchurch and the naval air stations on the\r\ncoast, together with all aircraft employed for naval purposes, were\r\ngrouped under the administration of the Air Department of the Admiralty\r\nand the Central Air Office. So, for a time, the national air force was\r\nbroken in two. The army and the navy had been willing enough to\r\nco-operate, but the habits of life and thought of a soldier and a sailor\r\nare incurably different. Moreover, the tasks of the two wings, as has\r\nbeen said, were distinct, and neither wing was very well able to\r\nappreciate the business of the other. The Naval Wing had not the\r\ntransport or equipment to operate at a distance from the sea, and, on\r\nthe other hand, was inclined to insist that all military aeroplanes,\r\nwhen used for coast defence, should be placed under naval command. The\r\nMilitary Wing was preoccupied with continental geography and with\r\nstrategical problems. The two attitudes and two methods lent a certain\r\nrichness and diversity to our air operations in the war. When Commander\r\nSamson established himself at Dunkirk during the first year of the war,\r\nhis variegated activities bore very little resemblance to the operations\r\nof the military squadrons on the battle-front.\r\n\r\nThe review of the fleet by the King, at Spithead, from the 18th to the\r\n22nd of July 1914, gave to the Royal Naval Air Service an opportunity to\r\ndemonstrate its use in connexion with naval operations. Most of the\r\navailable naval aircraft were concentrated at Portsmouth, Weymouth, and\r\nCalshot to take part in the review. On the 20th of July an organized\r\nflight of seventeen seaplanes, and two flights of aeroplanes in\r\nformation headed by Commander Samson, manoeuvred over the fleet. This\r\nformation flying had been practised at Eastchurch before the review.\r\nThree airships from Farnborough and one from Kingsnorth also took part\r\nin the demonstration. Within a few weeks all were to take part in the\r\noperations of war. The aeroplanes and seaplanes flew low over the fleet.\r\nSome naval officers, who had previously seen little of aircraft,\r\nexpressed the opinion that the planes flew low because they could not\r\nfly high, and that their performance was an acrobatic exhibition,\r\nuseless for the purposes of war. These and other doubters were soon\r\nconverted by the war.\r\n\r\nWhen the review was over, the seaplanes and airships returned to their\r\nseveral bases. The flights of aeroplanes, under Commander Samson, went\r\non tour, first to Dorchester, where they stayed four or five days, and\r\nthence to the Central Flying School. They had been there only a few\r\nhours when they received urgent orders to return to Eastchurch, where\r\nthey arrived on the 27th of July. On the same day seaplanes from other\r\nstations were assembled at Grain Island, Felixstowe, and Yarmouth, to be\r\nready to patrol the coast in the event of war. These precautionary\r\norders, and the orders given by the Admiralty on the previous day,\r\narresting the dispersal of the British fleet, were among the first\r\norders of the war. On the 29th of July instructions were issued to the\r\nNaval Air Service that the duties of scouting and patrol were to be\r\nsecondary to the protection of the country against hostile aircraft. All\r\nmachines were to be kept tuned up and ready for action. On the 30th of\r\nJuly the Army Council agreed to send No. 4 Squadron of aeroplanes to\r\nreinforce the naval machines at Eastchurch. Eastchurch, during the\r\nmonths before the war, had been active in rehearsal; fighting in the\r\nair had been practised, and trial raids, over Chatham and the\r\nneighbouring magazines, had been carried out, two aeroplanes attacking\r\nand six or eight forming a defensive screen. Work of this kind had knit\r\ntogether the Eastchurch unit and had fitted it for active service\r\nabroad. In the meantime, at the outbreak of the war, attacks by German\r\naircraft were expected on points of military and naval importance.\r\n\r\nGermany was known to possess eleven rigid airships, and was believed to\r\nhave others under construction. Our most authoritative knowledge of the\r\nstate of German aviation was derived from a series of competitions held\r\nin Germany from the 17th to the 25th of May 1914, and called 'The Prince\r\nHenry Circuit'. These were witnessed by Captain W. Henderson, R.N., as\r\nnaval attache, and by Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. A. Russell, as\r\nmilitary attache. The witnesses pay tribute to the skill and dash of the\r\nGerman flying officers and to the spirit of the flying battalions. The\r\nofficers they found to be fine-drawn, lean, determined-looking\r\nyoungsters, unlike the well-known heavy Teutonic type. Owing partly to\r\nthe monotony of German regimental life there was great competition, they\r\nwere told, to enter the flying service, eight hundred candidates having\r\npresented themselves for forty vacancies. In 'The Prince Henry Circuit',\r\na cross-country flight of more than a thousand miles, to be completed in\r\nsix days, twenty-six aeroplanes started. The weather was stormy, and\r\nthere were many accidents; one pilot and three observers were killed.\r\nThese were regarded as having lost their lives in action, and there was\r\nno interruption of the programme. Among the best of the many machines\r\nthat competed were the military L.V.G. (or Luft-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft)\r\nbiplane, which won the chief prizes, the A.E.G. (or Allgemeine\r\nElektrizitaets-Gesellschaft) biplane, the Albatross, and the Aviatik. On\r\nthe whole, said our witnesses, the Germans had not progressed fast or\r\nfar in aviation. They were still learning to fly; they were seeking for\r\nthe best type of machine; and had given no serious attention, as yet, to\r\nthe question of battle in the air. The test that was to compare the\r\nBritish and German air forces was now at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE WAR: THE ROYAL FLYING CORPS FROM MONS TO YPRES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe German war of the twentieth century, like the German wars of the\r\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries, was carefully planned and prepared\r\nby the military rulers of Prussia. To elucidate its origins and causes\r\nwill be the work of many long years. Yet enough is known to make it\r\ncertain that this last and greatest war conforms to the old design. The\r\nPrussians have always been proud of their doctrine of war, and have\r\nexplained it to the world with perfect frankness. War has always been\r\nregarded by them as the great engine of national progress. By war they\r\nunited the peoples of Germany; by war they hoped to gain for the peoples\r\nof Germany an acknowledged supremacy in the civilized world. These\r\npeoples had received unity at the hands of Prussia, and though they did\r\nnot like Prussia, they believed enthusiastically in Prussian strength\r\nand Prussian wisdom. If Prussia led them to war, they were encouraged to\r\nthink that the war would be unerringly designed to increase their power\r\nand prosperity. Yet many of them would have shrunk from naked assault\r\nand robbery; and Prussia, to conciliate these, invented the fable of the\r\nwar of defence. That a sudden attack on her neighbours, delivered by\r\nGermany in time of peace, is a strictly defensive act has often been\r\nexplained by German military and political writers, never perhaps more\r\nclearly than in a secret official report, drawn up at Berlin in the\r\nspring of 1913, on the strengthening of the German army. A copy of this\r\nreport fell into the hands of the French.\r\n\r\n'The people,' it says, 'must be accustomed to think that an offensive\r\nwar on our part is a necessity.... We must act with prudence in order to\r\narouse no suspicion.'\r\n\r\nThe fable of the war of defence was helped out with the fable of\r\nencirclement. Germany, being situated in the midst of Europe, had many\r\nneighbours, most of whom had more reason to fear her than to like her.\r\nAny exhibition of goodwill between these neighbours was treated by\r\nGerman statesmen, for years before the war, as a covert act of hostility\r\nto Germany, amply justifying reprisals. The treaty between France and\r\nRussia, wholly defensive in character, the expression of goodwill\r\nbetween France and England, inspired in part by fears of the restless\r\nambitions of Germany, though both were intended to guarantee the\r\nexisting state of things, were odious to Berlin. The peace of Europe\r\nhung by a thread.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 28th of June 1914, the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, heir\r\nto the throne of Austria, and his wife, the Duchess of Hohenberg, paid a\r\nvisit to Serajevo, the capital of Bosnia, and were there murdered by\r\nBosnian assassins. It has not been proved that Germany had any part in\r\nthe murder, but she was quite willing to take advantage of it. The Kiel\r\ncanal, joining the Baltic with the North Sea had just been widened to\r\nadmit the largest battleships, and the German army had just been raised\r\nto an unexampled strength. The gun was loaded and pointed; if it was\r\nallowed to be fired by accident the military rulers of Germany were much\r\nto blame. They were not in the habit of trusting any part of their plans\r\nto accident. But the excitement caused by the Archduke's murder was\r\nallowed to die away, and an uneasy calm succeeded. On the 23rd of July\r\nthe Austrian Government, alleging that the Serajevo assassinations had\r\nbeen planned in Belgrade, presented to Serbia, with the declared\r\napproval of Germany, an ultimatum, containing demands of so extreme a\r\ncharacter that the acceptance of them would have meant the abandonment\r\nby Serbia of her national independence. Serbia appealed to Russia, and,\r\nacting on Russia's advice, accepted all the demands except two. These\r\ntwo, which involved the appointment of Austro-Hungarian delegates to\r\nassist in administering the internal affairs of Serbia, were not bluntly\r\nrejected; Serbia asked that they should be referred to the Hague\r\nTribunal. Austria replied by withdrawing her minister, declaring war\r\nupon Serbia, and bombarding Belgrade. This action was bound to involve\r\nRussia, who could not stand by and see the Slavonic States of southern\r\nEurope destroyed and annexed. But the Russian Government, along with the\r\nGovernments of France, Great Britain, and Italy, did their utmost to\r\npreserve the peace. They suggested mediation and a conference of the\r\nPowers. Germany alone refused. Alleging that Russia had already\r\nmobilized her army, she decreed a state of war, and on Saturday, the 1st\r\nof August, declared war upon Russia. France by her treaty with Russia\r\nwould shortly have become involved; but the German Government would not\r\nwait for her. They judged it all-important to gain a military success at\r\nthe very start of the war, and to this everything had to give way. They\r\ndeclared war on France, and massed armies along the frontier between\r\nLiege and Luxembourg, with the intention of forcing a passage through\r\nBelgium. England, who was one of the guarantors of the integrity of\r\nBelgium, was thus involved. At 11.0 p.m. on the 4th of August, Great\r\nBritain declared war on Germany, and the World War had begun.\r\n\r\nThe events of the twelve days from the 23rd of July to the 4th of\r\nAugust, when they shall be set forth in detail, will furnish volumes of\r\nhistory. Those who study them minutely are in some danger of failing to\r\nsee the wood for the trees. The attitude of the nations was made clear\r\nenough during these days. When Austria issued her ultimatum, many people\r\nin England thought of it as a portent of renewed distant trouble in the\r\nBalkans, to be quickly begun and soon ended. It was not so regarded in\r\nGermany. The people of Germany, though they were not in the confidence\r\nof their Government, were sufficiently familiar with its mode of\r\noperation to recognize the challenge to Serbia for what it was,\r\nGermany's chosen occasion for her great war. The citizens not only of\r\nBerlin, but of the Rhineland, and of little northern towns on the Kiel\r\ncanal, went mad with joy; there was shouting and song and public\r\nfestivity. Meantime in England, as the truth dawned, there were hushed\r\nvoices and an intense solemnity. The day had come, and no one doubted\r\nthe severity of the ordeal. Yet neither did any one, except an unhappy\r\nfew who had been nursed in folly and illusion, doubt the necessity of\r\ntaking up the challenge. The country was united. Not only was the safety\r\nand existence of the British Commonwealth involved, but the great\r\nprinciple of civilization, difficult to name, but perhaps best called by\r\nthe appealing name of decency, which bids man remember that he is frail\r\nand that it behoves him to be considerate and pitiful and sincere, had\r\nbeen flouted by the arrogant military rulers of Germany. Great Britain\r\nhad a navy; her army and her air force, for the purposes of a great\r\nEuropean war, were yet to make. The motive that was to supply her with\r\nmillions of volunteers was not only patriotism, though patriotism was\r\nstrong, but a sense that her cause, in this war, was the cause of\r\nhumanity. There are many who will gladly fight to raise their country\r\nand people in power and prosperity above other countries and other\r\npeoples. There are many also among English-speaking peoples who are\r\nunwilling to fight for any such end. But they are fighters, and they\r\nwill fight to protect the weak and to assert the right. They are a\r\nreserve worth enlisting in any army; it was by their help that the\r\nopponents of Germany attained to a conquering strength. The systematic\r\ncruelties of Germany, inflicted by order on the helpless populations of\r\nSerbia and Belgium and northern France, are not matter of controversy;\r\nthey have been proved by many extant military documents and by the\r\ntestimony of many living witnesses. They were designed to reduce whole\r\npeoples to a state of impotent terror, beneath the level of humanity.\r\nThe apology made for them, that by shortening resistance to the\r\ninevitable they were in effect merciful, is a blasphemous apology, which\r\nputs Germany in the place of the Almighty. The effect anticipated did\r\nnot follow. The system of terrorism hardened and prolonged resistance;\r\nit launched against Germany the chivalry of the world; it created for\r\nuse against Germany the chivalry of the air; and it left Germany\r\nunhonoured in her ultimate downfall.\r\n\r\nThe German plan of campaign, it was rightly believed, was a swift\r\ninvasion and disablement of France, to be followed by more prolonged\r\noperations against Russia. By this plan the German army was to reach\r\nParis on the fortieth day after mobilization. There was no promise that\r\nGreat Britain would help France, but the attitude of Germany had long\r\nbeen so threatening that the General Staffs of the two countries had\r\ntaken counsel with each other concerning the best manner of employing\r\nthe British forces in the event of common resistance to German\r\naggression. It had been provisionally agreed that the British army\r\nshould be concentrated on the left flank of the French army, in the area\r\nbetween Avesnes and Le Cateau, but this agreement was based on the\r\nassumption that the two armies would be mobilized simultaneously. When\r\nthe principal British Ministers and the leading members of the naval and\r\nmilitary staffs assembled at Downing street on the 5th and 6th of\r\nAugust, we were already behindhand, and the whole question of the\r\nemployment and disposition of the expeditionary force had to be\r\nreopened. It was expected by some soldiers and some civilians that the\r\nlittle British army would be landed at a point on the coast of France or\r\nBelgium whence it could strike at the flank of the German invaders. The\r\nstrategic advantages of that idea had to yield to the enormous\r\nimportance of giving moral and material support to our Allies by\r\nfighting at their side; moreover, there could be no assurance that the\r\ncoast of Belgium would not fall into the hands of the Germans at a very\r\nearly stage in the campaign. Accordingly, it was agreed to ship our army\r\nto France, and to leave the manner of its employment to be settled in\r\nconcert with the French.\r\n\r\nThe original British Expeditionary Force, under the command of\r\nField-Marshal Sir John French, began to embark on the 9th of August; by\r\nthe 20th its concentration in a pear-shaped area between Maubeuge and Le\r\nCateau was complete. It consisted of the First Army Corps, under\r\nLieutenant-General Sir Douglas Haig; the Second Army Corps, under\r\nLieutenant-General Sir James Grierson, who died soon after landing in\r\nFrance and was succeeded by General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien; and the\r\nCavalry Division, under Major-General E. H. H. Allenby. The Germans made\r\nno attempt to interfere with the transport of the expeditionary force\r\nfrom England to France. They had many other things to think of, and\r\nthere is evidence to show that they viewed with satisfaction the placing\r\nof that admirable little force in a situation where they hoped that they\r\ncould cut it off and annihilate it. That they were disappointed in this\r\nhope was due not a little to the activity and efficiency of the newest\r\narm, numbering about a thousand, all told, the Royal Flying Corps.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Flying Corps took the field under the command of\r\nBrigadier-General Sir David Henderson. It consisted of Headquarters,\r\nAeroplane Squadrons Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5, and an Aircraft Park. Fairly\r\ncomplete arrangements, thought out in detail, had been made some months\r\nearlier for its mobilization. Each squadron was to mobilize at its peace\r\nstation, and was to be ready to move on the fourth day. On that day the\r\naeroplanes were to move, by air, first to Dover, and thence, on the\r\nsixth day, to the field base in the theatre of war. The horses,\r\nhorse-vehicles, and motor-bicycles, together with a certain amount of\r\nbaggage and supplies, were to travel by rail, and the mechanical\r\ntransport and trailers by road, to the appointed port of embarkation,\r\nthere to be shipped for the overseas base. The Aircraft Park, numbering\r\ntwelve officers and a hundred and sixty-two other ranks, with four\r\nmotor-cycles and twenty-four aeroplanes in cases, were to leave\r\nFarnborough for Avonmouth on the seventh day. Instructions were issued\r\nnaming the hour and place of departure of the various trains, with\r\ndetailed orders as to machines, personnel, transport, and petrol. On the\r\nsecond day of mobilization a detachment from No. 6 Squadron was to\r\nproceed to Dover, there to make ready a landing-ground for the other\r\nsquadrons, and to provide for replenishment of fuel and minor repairs to\r\naircraft. Squadron commanders were urged to work out all necessary\r\narrangements for the journey. How carefully they did this is shown by\r\nsome of the entries in the squadron diaries. In the diary of No. 2\r\nSquadron (Major C. J. Burke's) a list is given of the articles that were\r\nto be carried on each of the machines flying over to France. Besides\r\nrevolvers, glasses, a spare pair of goggles, and a roll of tools, pilots\r\nwere ordered to carry with them a water-bottle containing boiled water,\r\na small stove, and, in the haversack, biscuits, cold meat, a piece of\r\nchocolate, and a packet of soup-making material.\r\n\r\nThe programme for mobilization was, in the main, successfully carried\r\nout. The headquarters of the Royal Flying Corps left Farnborough for\r\nSouthampton on the night of the 11th of August, their motor transport\r\nhaving gone before. They embarked at Southampton, with their horses, and\r\nreached Amiens on the morning of the 13th. The movements of the Aircraft\r\nPark, though it was the last unit to leave England, may be next\r\nrecorded, because it was in effect the travelling base of the squadrons.\r\nThe personnel and equipment were entrained at Farnborough during the\r\nevening of Saturday, the 15th of August, and travelled to Avonmouth. Of\r\nthe twenty machines allotted to them only four, all Sopwith Tabloids,\r\nwere actually taken over in cases. Of the other sixteen (nine B.E. 2's,\r\none B.E. 2 c, three B.E. 8's, and three Henri Farmans) about half were\r\nused to bring the squadrons up to establishment; the remainder were\r\nflown over to Amiens by the personnel of the Aircraft Park, or by the\r\nspare pilots who accompanied the squadrons. The Aircraft Park embarked\r\nat Avonmouth very early on the morning of the 17th, arriving at Boulogne\r\non the night of the 18th. They disembarked, an unfamiliar apparition, on\r\nthe following morning. The landing officer had no precedent to guide him\r\nin dealing with them. Wing Commander W. D. Beatty tells how a wire was\r\ndispatched to General Headquarters: 'An unnumbered unit without\r\naeroplanes which calls itself an Aircraft Park has arrived. What are we\r\nto do with it?' If the question was not promptly answered at Boulogne it\r\nwas answered later on. The original Aircraft Park was the nucleus of\r\nthat vast system of supply and repair which supported the squadrons\r\noperating on the western front and kept them in fighting trim.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of August the Aircraft Park moved up to Amiens, to make an\r\nadvanced base for the squadrons, which were already at Maubeuge. Three\r\ndays were spent at Amiens in unloading, unpacking, and setting up\r\nworkshops. Then, on the 25th, they received orders to retire to Le\r\nHavre. The retreat from Mons had begun, and Boulogne was being evacuated\r\nby the British troops. How far the wave of invasion would flow could not\r\nbe certainly known; on the 30th of August, at the request of the French\r\nadmiral who commanded at Le Havre, the machines belonging to the\r\nAircraft Park were employed to carry out reconnaissances along the coast\r\nroads; on the following day German cavalry entered Amiens. There was a\r\nreal danger that stores and machines landed in northern France for the\r\nuse of the Royal Flying Corps might fall into the hands of the Germans;\r\naccordingly a base was established, for the reception of stores from\r\nEngland, at St.-Nazaire, on the Loire. The advanced base of the Aircraft\r\nPark moved up, by successive stages, as the prospects of the Allies\r\nimproved, first from Le Havre to Le Mans, then, at the end of September,\r\nto Juvisy, near Paris; lastly, in mid-October, the port base was moved\r\nfrom St.-Nazaire to Rouen, and at the end of October the advanced base\r\nleft Juvisy for St.-Omer, which became its permanent station during the\r\nearlier part of the war.\r\n\r\nThe squadrons flew to France. No. 2 Squadron, at Montrose, had the\r\nhardest task. Its pilots started on their southward flight to\r\nFarnborough as early as the 3rd of August; after some accidents they all\r\nreached Dover. Their transport left Montrose by rail on the morning of\r\nthe 8th of August and arrived the same evening at Prince's Dock, Govan,\r\nnear Glasgow, where the lorries and stores were loaded on S.S. _Dogra_\r\nfor Boulogne. No. 3 Squadron was at Netheravon when war broke out; on\r\nthe 12th of August the machines flew to Dover and the transport moved\r\noff by road to Southampton, where it was embarked for Boulogne. The\r\nsquadron suffered a loss at Netheravon. Second Lieutenant R. R. Skene, a\r\nskilful pilot, with Air Mechanic R. K. Barlow as passenger, crashed his\r\nmachine soon after taking off; both pilot and passenger were killed. No.\r\n4 Squadron on the 31st of July had been sent to Eastchurch, to assist\r\nthe navy in preparations for home defence and to be ready for\r\nmobilization. From Eastchurch the machines flew to Dover and the\r\ntransport proceeded to Southampton. By the evening of the 12th of August\r\nthe machines of Nos. 2, 3, and 4 Squadrons were at Dover. At midnight\r\nLieutenant-Colonel F. H. Sykes arrived, and orders were given for all\r\nmachines to be ready to fly over at 6.0 a.m. the following morning, the\r\n13th of August.\r\n\r\nThe first machine of No. 2 Squadron to start left at 6.25 a.m., and the\r\nfirst to arrive landed at Amiens at 8.20 a.m. This machine was flown by\r\nLieutenant H. D. Harvey-Kelly, one of the lightest hearted and highest\r\nspirited of the young pilots who gave their lives in the war. The\r\nmachines of No. 3 Squadron arrived safely at Amiens, with the exception\r\nof one piloted by Second Lieutenant E. N. Fuller, who with his mechanic\r\ndid not rejoin his squadron until five days later at Maubeuge. One\r\nflight of No. 4 Squadron remained at Dover to carry out patrol duties,\r\nbut a wireless flight, consisting of three officers who had made a study\r\nof wireless telegraphy, was attached to the squadron, and was taken\r\noverseas with it. Some of the aeroplanes of No. 4 Squadron were damaged\r\non the way over by following their leader, Captain F. J. L. Cogan, who\r\nwas forced by engine failure to land in a ploughed field in France.\r\n\r\nNo. 5 Squadron moved a little later than the other three. It was delayed\r\nby a shortage of shipping and a series of accidents to the machines.\r\nWhen the Concentration Camp broke up, this squadron had gone to occupy\r\nits new station at Gosport. On the 14th, when starting out for Dover,\r\nCaptain G. I. Carmichael wrecked his machine at Gosport; on the same day\r\nLieutenant R. O. Abercromby and Lieutenant H. F. Glanville damaged their\r\nmachines at Shoreham, and Lieutenant H. le M. Brock damaged his at\r\nSalmer. The squadron flew from Dover to France on the 15th of August;\r\nCaptain Carmichael, having obtained a new machine, flew over on that\r\nsame day; Lieutenant Brock rejoined the squadron at Maubeuge on the\r\n20th; Lieutenants Abercromby and Glanville on the 22nd. Lieutenant R. M.\r\nVaughan, who had flown over with the squadron, also rejoined it on the\r\n22nd; he had made a forced landing near Boulogne, had been arrested by\r\nthe French, and was imprisoned for nearly a week.\r\n\r\nThe transport of the squadrons, which proceeded by way of Southampton,\r\nwas largely made up from the motor-cars and commercial vans collected at\r\nRegent's Park in London during the first few days of the war. The\r\nammunition and bomb lorry of No. 5 Squadron had belonged to the\r\nproprietors of a famous sauce: it was a brilliant scarlet, with the\r\nlegend painted in gold letters on its side--_The World's Appetiser_. It\r\ncould be seen from some height in the air, and it helped the pilots of\r\nthe squadron, during the retreat from Mons, to identify their own\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\nThe names of the officers of the Royal Flying Corps who went to France,\r\nthe great majority of them by air, deserve record. They were the first\r\norganized national force to fly to a war overseas. The following is\r\nbelieved to be a complete list up to the eve of Mons, but it is not\r\ninfallible. Officers and men were changed up to the last minute, so that\r\nthe headquarters file, having been prepared in advance, is not\r\nauthoritative. The squadron war diaries are sometimes sketchy. Even when\r\nsurviving pilots set down what they remember, the whole war lies between\r\nthem and those early days, and their memory is often fragmentary. The\r\nfollowing list is compiled, as correctly as may be, from the diary of\r\nLieutenant B. H. Barrington-Kennett (a careful and accurate document),\r\nthe war diaries of Squadrons Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5, which were kept in\r\nsome detail, the headquarters' records, and the reminiscences of some of\r\nthe officers who flew across or who travelled with the transport.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS\r\n\r\n  Brigadier-General Sir David Henderson, K.C.B., D.S.O.; Commander,\r\n    Royal Flying Corps.\r\n  Lieutenant-Colonel F.

Verney, Army Service Corps.\r\n\r\nSomething must be said of the machines which flew to France. Experience\r\nat manoeuvres had favoured the factory B.E. 2 biplane; of the other\r\ntypes most in use the Henri Farman had been found fatiguing to fly, and\r\nthe Maurice Farman was too slow. Accordingly, in the winter of 1913-14\r\nLieutenant-Colonel F. H. Sykes had urged the gradual substitution of\r\nB.E. machines for the Farmans. Major W. S. Brancker, writing for the\r\nDirector-General of Military Aeronautics, objected to this proposal on\r\nthe ground that until a satisfactory type of fighting aeroplane should\r\nbe evolved, the Henri Farman was the only machine that could mount\r\nweapons effectively; and further, that a slow machine had some\r\nadvantages for observation. The first of these objections was not fully\r\nmet until firing through the airscrew was introduced; the second was for\r\na long time an accepted idea. The war was to prove that a slow machine,\r\nexposed to armed attack, cannot live in the air. The battle of the\r\nmachines ended, for the time, in compromise. It was judged important\r\nthat the Flying Corps should have four squadrons ready for war by the\r\nspring of 1914, and large changes would have caused delay. In the event,\r\nat the date of mobilization, No. 2 Squadron and No. 4 Squadron were\r\nfurnished throughout with B.E. 2 machines; No. 3 Squadron made use of\r\nBleriots and Henri Farmans, and No. 5 of Henri Farmans, Avros, and B.E.\r\n8's. A single type of machine for a single squadron is a thing to be\r\ndesired; the squadron is easier for the pilots and the mechanics to\r\nhandle; but in the early days of the war there was no formation flying;\r\neach machine did its work alone, so that uniformity was of less\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nWhen the Flying Corps arrived in France they were received by the French\r\nwith enthusiasm, and had their full share of the hospitality of those\r\ndays. The officers were treated as honoured guests; the men with the\r\ntransport were greeted by crowds of villagers, who at all their\r\nstopping-places pressed on them bottles of wine, bunches of flowers,\r\nfruit, and eggs. At Amiens the transport and machines were parked\r\noutside the town, without cover, and the officers were billeted at the\r\n'Hotel du Rhin' and elsewhere. The hardships of the war were yet to\r\ncome. Lieutenant B. H. Barrington-Kennett, with his mind always set on\r\nthe task before them, remarks: 'There seemed to be a general\r\nmisunderstanding amongst the troops as to the length of time during\r\nwhich rations have to last. They were apt to eat what they wanted at one\r\nmeal and then throw the remainder away. R.F.C. peace training does not\r\nencourage economy with food, as the men are financially well off, and\r\ncan always buy food and drink in the villages.'\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 16th of August, the headquarters of the Flying Corps, the\r\naeroplanes of Nos. 2, 3, and 4 Squadrons, and the transport of Nos. 3\r\nand 4 Squadrons moved from Amiens to Maubeuge. Second Lieutenant E. W.\r\nC. Perry and his mechanic, H. E. Parfitt, of No. 3 Squadron, who were\r\nflying a B.E. 8 machine (familiarly known as a 'bloater'), crashed over\r\nthe aerodrome at Amiens; the machine caught fire, and both were killed.\r\nThere was another accident on the 18th, when the aeroplanes and\r\ntransport of No. 5 Squadron followed. Second Lieutenant R. R.\r\nSmith-Barry and Corporal F. Geard, also flying a B.E. 8 machine, crashed\r\nat Peronne; the officer broke several bones, and the corporal was\r\nkilled. Three of these machines in all were flown over at the beginning;\r\nthey had been allotted to the Aircraft Park, and were taken on charge of\r\nthe squadrons in the field to fill vacancies caused by mishaps. The\r\nthird of them was the machine flown over by Captain G. I. Carmichael.\r\n\r\nAt Maubeuge the French authorities gave all the help they could,\r\nproviding blankets and straw for the troops. The Flying Corps were now\r\nin the war zone, but for the first two or three days the conditions were\r\nthose of peace. They saw nothing of the British army till one evening\r\nBritish troops marched through Maubeuge on their way to Mons. 'We were\r\nrather sorry they had come,' says Wing Commander P. B. Joubert de la\r\nFerte, 'because up till that moment we had only been fired on by the\r\nFrench whenever we flew. Now we were fired on by French _and_\r\nEnglish.... To this day I can remember the roar of musketry that\r\ngreeted two of our machines as they left the aerodrome and crossed the\r\nmain Maubeuge-Mons road, along which a British column was proceeding.'\r\nTo guard against incidents like this the Flying Corps, while stationed\r\nat Maubeuge, turned to, and by working all night painted a Union Jack in\r\nthe form of a shield on the under-side of the lower planes of all the\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nWhile the Flying Corps remained at Maubeuge and began to carry out\r\nreconnaissances over Belgium, the little British army had moved up north\r\nto Mons, where it first met the enemy. By the 22nd of August it was in\r\nposition, on a front of some twenty-five miles, the First Army Corps\r\nholding a line from Harmignies to Peissant on the east, the Second Army\r\nCorps holding Mons and the canal that runs from Mons to Conde on the\r\nwest. On the right of the British the Fifth French Army, under General\r\nLanrezac, was coming up to the line of the river Sambre.\r\n\r\nThe original German plan was broad and simple. The main striking force\r\nwas to march through Belgium and Luxembourg into France. Its advance was\r\nto be a wheel pivoting on Thionville. Count von Schlieffen, who had\r\nvacated the appointment of Chief of the General Staff in 1906, had\r\nprepared this plan. He maintained that if the advance of a strong right\r\nwing, marching on Paris through Belgium, were firmly persisted in, it\r\nwould draw the bulk of the French forces away from their eastern\r\nfortress positions to the neighbourhood of Paris, and that there the\r\ndecisive battle would be fought. His successor, von Moltke, believed\r\nthat the French, on the outbreak of war, would at once deliver a strong\r\noffensive in Lorraine and so would themselves come into the open, away\r\nfrom the bastion of the eastern fortresses. He must be prepared, he\r\nthought, to fight the decisive battle either on his left wing in\r\nLorraine, or on his right wing near Paris, or, in short, at any point\r\nthat the initial operations of the French should determine. This was not\r\nthe conception of Count von Schlieffen, who had intended to impose his\r\nwill on the campaign and to make the enemy conform to his movements.\r\nWhen he was on his death-bed in 1913, his thoughts were fixed on the\r\nwar. 'It must come to a fight,' were the last words he was heard to\r\nmutter, 'only give me a strong right wing.' Von Moltke, though he did\r\nnot absolutely weaken the right wing, weakened it relatively, by using\r\nmost of the newly formed divisions of the German army for strengthening\r\nthe left wing.\r\n\r\nThe French, when the war came, delivered their offensive in Alsace and\r\nLorraine as had been expected, but not in the strength that had been\r\nexpected. They were held up, and retired, not without loss, to strong\r\ndefensive positions covering Epinal and Nancy. Meantime, the advance of\r\nthe German armies through Belgium was met by a French offensive in the\r\nArdennes, which also failed, whereupon General Joffre ordered a retreat\r\non the whole front, and began to move some of his forces westward, to\r\nprepare for the battle in front of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe successes won by the German left wing and centre against a yielding\r\nand retreating enemy were mistaken by the German high command for\r\ndecisive actions, which they were not. The French armies which had been\r\ndriven back on the Lorraine front rapidly recovered, and on the 25th of\r\nAugust delivered a brilliant counter-offensive, inflicting heavy losses\r\non the Germans, and in effect upsetting all the German plans. The\r\nindecision which marked the movements of the German right wing through\r\nnorthern France had its origin in von Moltke's modifications of von\r\nSchlieffen's plans and in the readiness of the Germans to believe that\r\nthe war was virtually won.[4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: This brief summary is based on two admirable articles\r\n    in _The Army Quarterly_ for April and July 1921, compiled by the\r\n    Historical Section (Military Branch) of the Committee of Imperial\r\n    Defence.]\r\n\r\nThe heroic stand made by the Belgians at Liege purchased invaluable time\r\nfor the preparations of the Allies. When, on the 17th of August, the\r\nlast fort of Liege fell, the great wheel of the German northern armies\r\nbegan to revolve. Its pace was to be regulated by the pace of the armies\r\nnearest to its circumference; that is to say, the First Army, under von\r\nKluck, and the Second Army, under von Buelow. Three divisions of cavalry\r\nwere to advance against the line Antwerp-Brussels-Charleroi, moving\r\nwestward across Belgium in order to discover whether a Belgian army was\r\nstill in being, whether the British had landed any troops, and whether\r\nFrench forces were moving up into northern Belgium. The Belgian army\r\nretired within the defensive lines of Antwerp, and by the 20th of August\r\nBrussels was in the hands of the enemy. By the 22nd, von Buelow's army\r\nhad entered Charleroi and was crossing the Sambre. The repulse of the\r\nFrench centre in the Ardennes left the British army and the French Fifth\r\nArmy completely isolated on the front Mons-Charleroi. The French Fifth\r\nArmy began to retreat. On Sunday morning, the 23rd of August, von\r\nKluck's army came into action against the British position at Mons.\r\n\r\nThe British army had taken up its position in high hopes. It was not a\r\nBritish defeat which began the retreat from Mons, and the troops were\r\nnot well pleased when they were ordered to retire. But the retreat was\r\ninevitable, and the most that the British could do was by rearguard\r\nactions to put a brake upon the speed of the advancing enemy until such\r\ntime as they should be able to form up again in the Allied line and\r\nassail him. Much depended on their power to gain information concerning\r\nthe movements of the enemy, so that they might know their own dangers\r\nand opportunities. Von Kluck had at first no definite news of the\r\nwhereabouts of the British army. As late as the 20th of August the\r\nGerman Supreme Command had issued a communication to the German armies\r\nstating that 'a disembarkation of British Forces at Boulogne and their\r\nemployment from the direction of Lille must be taken into account. It is\r\nthe opinion here, however, that a landing on a big scale has not yet\r\ntaken place.' General von Zwehl, Commander of the Seventh Reserve Corps,\r\nwriting in September 1919, tells how the Germans had no reliable\r\ninformation concerning the British expeditionary force. 'It was only on\r\nthe 22nd of August,' he says, 'that an English cavalry squadron was\r\nheard of at Casteau, six miles north-east of Mons, and an aeroplane of\r\nthe English fifth flying squadron was shot down that had gone up from\r\nMaubeuge. The presence of the English in front was thus established,\r\nalthough nothing as regards their strength.' The first news that reached\r\nGeneral von Kluck of the presence of the British forces came to him from\r\na British, not from a German, aeroplane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map Illustrating Aerial Reconnaissance Area. 19th to 24th\r\nAug. 1914]\r\n\r\nThe first aerial reconnaissances by the Royal Flying Corps were carried\r\nout on Wednesday, the 19th of August, by Captain P. B. Joubert de la\r\nFerte of No. 3 Squadron, in a Bleriot, and Lieutenant G. W. Mapplebeck\r\nof No. 4 Squadron, in a B.E. They started at 9.30 a.m., and flew without\r\nobservers. Captain Joubert de la Ferte was to reconnoitre\r\nNivelles-Genappe in order to report what Belgian forces were in that\r\nneighbourhood; Lieutenant Mapplebeck was to find out whether enemy\r\ncavalry were still in force in the neighbourhood of Gembloux. The\r\nmachines were to fly together as far as Nivelles, 'so that if one was\r\nobliged to descend the other could report its whereabouts'. The machines\r\nlost their way and lost each other. Lieutenant Mapplebeck eventually\r\nfound himself over a large town which he failed to recognize as\r\nBrussels. Later he picked up his position at Ottignies, and soon found\r\nGembloux, where he could see only a small body of cavalry moving in a\r\nsouth-easterly direction. After leaving Gembloux he was enveloped in\r\ncloud for some miles, came down to 300 feet over Namur, followed the\r\nSambre, missed Maubeuge, and landed near Le Cateau, whence he flew back\r\nto the aerodrome at Maubeuge. He had been away from 9.30 a.m. to 12.0\r\nmidday. Captain Joubert de la Ferte, whose machine was slower than\r\nLieutenant Mapplebeck's, attempted to steer by compass through the banks\r\nof cloud, and after two hours of wandering landed at Tournai. He made\r\ninquiries concerning the Belgian army, but nothing was known of them. He\r\nleft Tournai at 12.15 p.m., lost his way again, and at 2.0 p.m. landed\r\nat Courtrai. Here he was told by the gendarmerie that the headquarters\r\nof the Belgian flying corps was at Louvain. He left Courtrai at 3.0 p.m.\r\nand passed over Ath, Hal, Braine l'Alleud, Nivelles, returning to\r\nMaubeuge at 5.30 p.m. He reported occasional trains in the main stations\r\nand pickets on the roads to Brussels.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th Major C. A. H. Longcroft, with Captain U. J. D. Bourke as\r\nobserver, reconnoitred as far as Louvain and reported a force of all\r\narms moving south-west through Tervueren, and another force moving into\r\nWavre. They also saw an aerodrome just east of Louvain with seven\r\nmachines on the ground. Lieutenant E. R. L. Corballis, who, with Captain\r\nG. E. Todd, flew over the area Nivelles-Hal-Enghien, reported that there\r\nwas no sign of troops and that all bridges in the area appeared to be\r\nintact. The German flood was spreading but was still some distance away.\r\nOn the following day (an important day of enemy movements) the weather\r\nin the morning was too foggy for observation, and in the afternoon was\r\nrainy and misty. Three reconnaissances which were made in the afternoon\r\nshowed that the country immediately in front of the British was very\r\nquiet, but in the wood one mile south of Nivelles Lieutenant Corballis\r\nreported a large body of cavalry with some guns and infantry (this was\r\nlater identified as the German 9th Cavalry Division), and another body\r\nof infantry moving south on Charleroi. At Pont-a-Celles on the Charleroi\r\ncanal, south of Nivelles, three villages were seen to be burning.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd there were twelve reconnaissances which revealed the\r\npresence of large bodies of troops moving in the direction of the\r\nBritish front, and did much to dissipate the fog of war. The first\r\nmachine to return came in soon after eleven. This was piloted by Captain\r\nG. S. Shephard, with Lieutenant I. M. Bonham-Carter as observer. They\r\nhad landed at Beaumont (about twelve miles east of Maubeuge) for petrol.\r\nHere they were informed that French cavalry had encountered German\r\ninfantry north of the Sambre canal on the previous afternoon, and had\r\nhad to fall back. The next machine to return came in at 11.50 a.m. with\r\na wounded observer, Sergeant-Major D. S. Jillings of No. 2 Squadron. He\r\nwas the first British soldier to be wounded in an aeroplane, and this\r\ncasualty seemed to bring the German armies nearer than a dozen\r\nunmolested reconnaissances could have done. The machine, piloted by\r\nLieutenant M. W. Noel, had come under heavy rifle fire first of all at\r\nOllignies, south-east of Lessines, and then, after passing over a\r\ncavalry regiment just south-west of Ghislenghien, had been met with\r\nrifle and machine-gun fire. Frequent rifle fire was encountered all the\r\nway back to Ath, and just south-east of Ath, over Maffle, Sergeant-Major\r\nJillings had been wounded in the leg by a rifle bullet. Confirmation of\r\nthe presence of large bodies of enemy in this area came from Captain L.\r\nE. O. Charlton flying as observer with Second Lieutenant V. H. N.\r\nWadham. They started at 10.0 a.m. and passed over Charleroi, Gembloux,\r\nand Brussels without seeing any large movements, but reported that the\r\nnorthern part of Charleroi and many other towns and villages in that\r\narea were burning. From Brussels they went on towards Grammont, and\r\nlanded at Moerbeke, two miles south-east of Grammont, to make inquiries.\r\nHere they received information which hastened their departure. They\r\nlearnt that a force of 5,000 Germans was in Grammont, that cavalry and\r\ncyclists were in Lessines, and that cavalry were expected from Enghien\r\nto arrive in Ath that evening. When passing over Bassilly, about\r\nhalf-way between Ath and Enghien, they were fired on by enemy troops\r\nwhich they estimated at the strength of an infantry brigade, and they\r\ndrew further fire from patrols in Ath. They came in with their\r\ninformation at 1.10 p.m.; Lieutenant W. H. C. Mansfield just before this\r\nhad reported large bodies moving into Enghien and Soignies. Afternoon\r\nreconnaissances added little that was new except that there were cavalry\r\nand infantry in the area north of the Mons-Conde canal, and cavalry as\r\nfar west as Peruwelz.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Reconnaissance Report of Lieutenant C. G. G. Bayly.\r\n\r\n_To face page 303._]\r\n\r\nThe most important reconnaissance of the day is unfortunately not\r\nrecorded in the war diary. The value of the report when it came in was\r\nrecognized at once, and Brigadier-General Sir David Henderson took it\r\npersonally to General Headquarters. It stated that a long column, whose\r\nstrength was estimated to be that of an army corps, was moving westward\r\non the Brussels-Ninove road. At Ninove the column continued south-west\r\ntowards Grammont. This was von Kluck's Second Corps, and the report\r\nseemed to show an attempt at an enveloping movement. The same report\r\nconfirmed what had already been seen, the presence of enemy troops\r\nmoving along the great Chaussee on Soignies. This column was taking\r\nadvantage of the trees on either side of the road to shield its\r\nmovements. This was the first day on which a machine failed to return\r\nfrom over enemy territory. Lieutenants V. Waterfall and C. G. G. Bayly,\r\nof No. 5 Squadron, started on a reconnaissance in an Avro at 10.16 a.m.\r\nand next day were reported missing. It was the bringing down of this\r\nmachine, no doubt, which gave the Germans their first assurance of the\r\npresence of the British forces. The observer's report, so far as he had\r\nwritten it, was picked up near the wreckage of the machine by some\r\nBelgian peasants, and eventually found its way to the War Office in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nSir John French on the evening of the 22nd held a conference at Le\r\nCateau, whereat the position of the Germans, so far as it was then\r\nknown, was explained and discussed. At the close of the conference Sir\r\nJohn stated that owing to the retreat of the French Fifth Army, the\r\nBritish offensive would not take place. A request from General Lanrezac\r\narrived at 11.0 p.m., asking for offensive action against the German\r\nright flank, which was pressing him back from the Sambre. This could not\r\nbe undertaken, but Sir John French promised to remain in his position\r\nfor twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nIn his book, _A Staff Officer's Scrap Book_, Sir Ian Hamilton, who was\r\nattached to the Japanese army during the Russo-Japanese War, has the\r\nfollowing entry: 'The Russians are sending up balloons to our front, and\r\nin front of the Twelfth Division. Judging by manoeuvres and South\r\nAfrican experiences, they should now obtain a lot of misleading\r\nintelligence.' Observation from the air, when the war broke out, had\r\nstill to prove its worth. The Royal Flying Corps, though confident of\r\nits own ability, was a new and untried arm. In the early reports there\r\nare occasional inaccuracies. Some of the early observers, among those\r\nwho were hastily enrolled to bring newly formed squadrons up to\r\nstrength, had not much military knowledge, and were not practised in\r\nreading the appearances of things seen from the air. At the time of the\r\nbattles of Ypres, 1914, observers of No. 6 Squadron, which had prepared\r\nitself in hot haste for foreign service, mistook long patches of tar on\r\nmacadamized roads for troops on the move, and the shadows cast by the\r\ngravestones in a churchyard for a military bivouac. Mistakes like these,\r\nthough they were not very many, naturally made commanding officers shy\r\nof trusting implicitly to reports from the air. Yet the early reports of\r\nthe first four squadrons did show without any possibility of mistake how\r\nformidable the German movements were.\r\n\r\nSir John French remained at Mons and was led into fighting a battle in a\r\nperilous position against much superior forces. The air reports of the\r\n22nd had given some hints of the success of von Buelow's army in crossing\r\nthe Sambre, had indicated a possible enveloping movement from the\r\ndirection of Grammont, and had revealed something of the strength of the\r\nenemy troops on the British front. On the following day the attack began\r\non the position at Mons, and pilots and observers were flying over and\r\nbehind the battle-field looking for enemy movements, and locating enemy\r\nbatteries.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th the retreat was in progress. As early as the morning of the\r\n23rd the Royal Flying Corps had begun to shift its quarters from\r\nMaubeuge to Le Cateau. The transport and machines of No. 3 Squadron\r\nmoved southward on that day, and on the 24th headquarters and other\r\nsquadrons also moved to Le Cateau. 'We slept,' says Major Maurice\r\nBaring, 'and when I say we I mean dozens of pilots, fully dressed in a\r\nbarn, on the top of, and underneath, an enormous load of straw....\r\nEverybody was quite cheerful, especially the pilots.' On the afternoon\r\nof the 25th they moved again to St.-Quentin. The rapidity of the retreat\r\nput a heavy strain upon the headquarters of the Royal Flying Corps,\r\nwhich had to travel before the retreating army, to select an old\r\naerodrome or to make a new one almost every day, and in the brief hours\r\nbetween arrival and departure to carry on all the complicated and\r\ndelicate business of ministering to the needs of the squadrons. The\r\nplaces occupied by headquarters during the retreat were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Sunday, 16th    August          Maubeuge.\r\n  Monday, 24th    August          Le Cateau.\r\n  Tuesday, 25th   August          St.-Quentin.\r\n  Wednesday, 26th August          La Fere.\r\n  Friday, 28th    August          Compiegne.\r\n  Sunday, 30th    August          Senlis.\r\n  Monday, 31st    August          Juilly.\r\n  Wednesday, 2nd  September       Serris.\r\n  Thursday, 3rd   September       Touquin.\r\n  Friday, 4th     September       Melun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Movements of the Royal Flying Corps from Aug. 16th to\r\nOct. 12th 1914.]\r\n\r\nIn some of these places regular aerodromes were available, in others a\r\nlanding-ground had to be improvised. Sometimes officers of headquarters\r\nwould be sent on a long way ahead in motor-cars to select a\r\nlanding-ground, while another officer in a motor-car was detailed to\r\nguide the transport. This he did by taking with him a small number of\r\nmen and dropping them one by one at the partings of the ways. When the\r\nroute was very complicated, these guides became so many that they had to\r\nbe carried in a transport lorry. The transport drivers were not as yet\r\nskilled in the art of map-reading, and to lose the transport would have\r\nleft the Flying Corps helpless. Sometimes the officers who selected\r\nthe landing-ground moved with the transport, and made their choice when\r\nthe transport reached its destination. The only recognized French\r\naerodromes which were used by the Royal Flying Corps during the retreat\r\nwere those at Compiegne, Senlis, and Melun.\r\n\r\nWhilst the aerodromes were changing almost daily, the officers carried\r\non reconnaissance, sometimes starting out not knowing whether their\r\naerodrome would be in British or enemy hands by the time they should\r\nreturn. On the 24th, whilst the squadrons were moving from Maubeuge to\r\nLe Cateau, the enemy advance as seen from the air looked menacing\r\nenough. Captain G. S. Shephard and Lieutenant I. M. Bonham-Carter were\r\nwatching von Kluck's right wing soon after 4.0 a.m. They returned at six\r\no'clock with news of extensive movement about Ath and Leuze. They\r\nreported a broken column nearly ten miles long with its head pointing at\r\nPeruwelz. The column branched off the main Ath-Tournai road at Leuze.\r\nThis was part of von Kluck's Second Corps, and its line of march would\r\ntake it to the west of the extreme western flank of the British army.\r\nThe news was not reassuring. Captain H. C. Jackson as observer with\r\nLieutenant E. L. Conran went up at 8.30 a.m. and came back at 12.30 p.m.\r\nwith information of long enemy columns moving from Grammont through\r\nLessines into La Hamaide and further troops on the Ath-Leuze road. They\r\nhad flown as far as Ninove and Alost, but found the country there clear.\r\nOn returning over Lessines at 11.30 a.m. they saw three German\r\naeroplanes on the ground; they dropped a bomb overboard, but missed.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the 24th, the first day of the retreat, the position\r\nwas on the whole not unsatisfactory. The British Fifth Division had not\r\nonly defended six miles of front, but with the aid of the cavalry and\r\nthe 19th Infantry Brigade had met and beaten off von Kluck's enveloping\r\nattack. But that attack was soon renewed. On the following morning a\r\nheavy movement of German troops southward from Marchiennes, with\r\ncavalry, guns, and transport, was reported at six o'clock. Marchiennes\r\nis almost midway between Valenciennes and Douai, to the west of the\r\nBritish line of retreat. This moving line of troops continued southward\r\nthrough Somain for a distance of about five miles, and then bent in a\r\nsouth-easterly direction, pointing straight at Le Cateau, until it\r\nreached Bouchain, where there were mounted and dismounted troops\r\nextending over three miles. But Le Cateau was not the objective of these\r\ntroops. General von Kluck believed that the next stand of the British\r\narmy, after Mons, would be made on a position running east and west\r\nthrough Bavai, and resting its right on the fortress of Maubeuge. The\r\ntroops seen at Bouchain were intended to envelop it and take it in the\r\nrear. Meantime the British army, having escaped the lure of Maubeuge,\r\nwas continuing its painful march southward on both sides of the Forest\r\nof Mormal; and the claw that was extended to catch it closed upon air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map Illustrating Aerial Reconnaissance Area.\r\n25th & 26th August 1914.]\r\n\r\nThese movements of von Kluck's army on the 25th were influenced by\r\nhis own air reports, which appear to have misled him. The army order\r\nissued by him from Soignies at 8.30 p.m. on the night of the 24th\r\nassumed that the British army would accept battle on the line\r\nMaubeuge-Bavai-Valenciennes. Von Kluck was very hopeful. 'The\r\noutflanking of the left of the British Army,' he says, 'on the\r\nassumption that it remained in position, appeared to be guaranteed.'\r\nAn important air report which reached him at 1.0 a.m. on the 25th\r\nled him to suspect that the British were withdrawing on Maubeuge.\r\nSpeaking of this report, he says: 'Enemy columns of all arms were in\r\nretreat on the roads Bellignies-Bavai, La Flamengrie-Bavai, and\r\nGommegnies-Bavai. The direction in which the movement was being made\r\nbeyond Bavai had not yet been determined; nevertheless, the army\r\ncommander began to suspect that the British were withdrawing on\r\nMaubeuge.' He sent out orders in great haste by motor-car for the\r\narmy to advance in a more southerly direction. At 9.0 a.m. however,\r\na new air report came as a surprise. Long British columns of all\r\narms were moving from Bavai along the Roman road to Le Cateau, and\r\nnumerous small columns, single companies, batteries, squadrons, and\r\ncars were crossing the Selle, north and south of Solesmes. 'The\r\nenemy was marching in an almost opposite direction to what was\r\nsupposed earlier in the morning.' A fresh order was at once sent out\r\nto attack the British and bring them to a standstill. Von Kluck does\r\nnot quote these air reports. But he says enough to show that he was\r\nmisled chiefly by his own preconceptions. Hope told a flattering\r\ntale, and he seems to have been possessed by the idea that the\r\nBritish army would be tempted into the fortress of Maubeuge.\r\n\r\nThe whole body of information which on any one day was obtained from the\r\nreconnaissances of the Royal Flying Corps could be set out in detail\r\nonly by quoting all the reports in full. That would be too cumbrous a\r\nmethod of writing history. The reports contain much that is\r\ncomparatively insignificant. But the reader of this book may desire to\r\nknow exactly what an air report is like, and his curiosity shall be\r\ngratified. Here is the report, of no special tactical significance, but\r\nfull of incident, of a long air reconnaissance made by Lieutenant G. F.\r\nPretyman and Major L. B. Boyd-Moss in a machine of No. 3 Squadron, on\r\nthe day of the battle of Le Cateau:\r\n\r\n  _No. of Reconnaissance_: 57. _Hour Started_: 11.10 a.m.\r\n  _Date_: 26.8.1914.           _Hour Ended_: 1.40 p.m.\r\n  _Aeroplane No._: 387.        _Pilot_: Lieutenant G.

B. BOYD-MOSS, Major.\r\n\r\nThe machine, it will be seen, dropped a bomb on a park of transport\r\nvehicles, was fired at by howitzers, and was brought down by heavy\r\ninfantry fire. A more dreaded enemy here makes an early appearance--the\r\nprevailing westerly wind. This wind was the heaviest trial for pilots\r\nduring years on the western front; it made it easy to get at the enemy\r\nand difficult to get away from him; the road to safety always, while the\r\nwest wind was blowing, lay uphill.\r\n\r\nOn this same day--the day of the battle of Le Cateau--the First Army\r\nCorps under Sir Douglas Haig was delayed, and failed to reach its\r\nappointed position in touch with the Second Army Corps. Lieutenant A. E.\r\nBorton and Lieutenant F. G. Small were dispatched from headquarters in a\r\nmachine of No. 5 Squadron to 'find Sir Douglas Haig'. With them went\r\nLieutenant D. S. Lewis in a B.E. machine fitted with wireless apparatus.\r\nHe was to report by wireless when Sir Douglas Haig was found.\r\nLieutenants Borton and Small in their Henri Farman, being unable to find\r\na suitable landing-ground in the rear of the First Army Corps, landed\r\nbetween the firing lines in a field protected by a rise in the ground\r\nfrom the direct fire of the enemy. With the aid of a cavalry patrol they\r\nsucceeded in delivering their message to Sir Douglas Haig, after which\r\nthey returned to their machine, started up the engine, and flew away in\r\nthe presence of two Uhlans, who had just ridden into the field.\r\nMeantime, Lieutenant Lewis, to whom they were unable to signal, lost\r\ntouch with them; he circled in the air for an hour under fire, and\r\nreturned with one shell splinter and four bullet-holes in his machine,\r\nand with one of his hands grazed by a bullet. Captain L. E. O. Charlton\r\nwas also sent at 11.30 a.m. to report to General Smith-Dorrien at\r\nBertry. 'I found him', he says, 'in considerable anxiety as to his left\r\nabout Haucourt and Selvigny. Having been on that flank at 9.30 a.m., I\r\nwas able to reassure him as to its safety, and made another ascent to\r\nconfirm my previous reconnaissance. During the reconnaissance I was able\r\nto report that the enemy had made no progress, though their shell-fire\r\nhad increased. I was sent up again to examine the right about Le Cateau,\r\nand on reporting at 2.45 p.m. the General told me that the Fifth\r\nDivision had been unable to withstand a most determined artillery\r\nattack, and had come back. He added that he had no doubt he would\r\nsucceed in getting them back somehow, and requested me to inform Sir\r\nArchibald Murray. I left at 3.0 p.m. and reported to General\r\nHeadquarters as ordered.'\r\n\r\nGeneral Smith-Dorrien did succeed in getting them back. The stand made\r\nat Le Cateau was a great fight against odds; and the part played in the\r\nbattle by the Royal Flying Corps seems a little thing when it is\r\ncompared with the gallant resistance of the infantry. But British\r\nmachines were flying over the enemy, under fire, within full view of the\r\nBritish army, and some British officers who took part in the battle have\r\ndescribed how the sight of our aeroplanes above them raised the spirits\r\nof the troops and gave them a feeling of security.\r\n\r\nCopies of the original reports made out by observers before and during\r\nthe retreat from Mons are preserved in the war diary of headquarters,\r\nRoyal Flying Corps. It is not possible to say when each of these reports\r\nreached General Headquarters; they were sent in as soon as possible\r\nafter the machines landed--some of them at once by telephone. When the\r\nreports are systematically mapped out, day by day, they give a fairly\r\naccurate picture of the German advance and throw light on the German\r\nplans. General von Kluck speaks more than once of driving the British\r\narmy before him, but the complete map of the German movements, as they\r\nwere reported day by day from the air, shows that his predominant idea\r\nwas to envelop them. Always the crab-like claw is seen extended to the\r\nwest and beginning to close in on the line of the British retreat;\r\nalways the British army is already at a point farther south on the line,\r\nout of the reach of the claw. When with swollen and blistered feet and\r\nhalf asleep on the march, the patient British soldier carried on, he was\r\ndoing more to defeat the Germans than he could have done if his dearest\r\nwish had been granted and he had been allowed to make a desperate stand.\r\nIt is a wonderful army that can suffer the long depression and fatigue\r\nof such a retreat and yet keep its fighting quality unimpaired.\r\n\r\nVon Kluck's advance after the battle of Le Cateau was directed to the\r\nsouth-west. Speaking of the situation on the 28th. of August, he says,\r\n'The occupation of the Somme area marked the conclusion of the fighting\r\nwith the British Army for the time being. In spite of the great efforts\r\nof the First Army the British had escaped the repeated attempts to\r\nenvelop them. They continued their retreat southwards.' On the same day\r\nthe headquarters of the German army propounded a new task. 'The left\r\nwing of the main French forces', they wrote, 'is retreating in a\r\nsoutherly and south-westerly direction in front of the victorious Second\r\nand Third Armies. It appears to be of decisive importance to find the\r\nflank of this force, whether retreating or in position, force it away\r\nfrom Paris, and outflank it. Compared with this new objective the\r\nattempt to force the British Army away from the coast is of minor\r\nimportance.'\r\n\r\nThe German Supreme Command were giving most of their attention to the\r\noperations on their left wing, where the Fifth and Sixth German Armies\r\nwere converging for the attack on Nancy, which town, when it fell, was\r\nto witness the triumphal entry of the German Emperor. Meantime, the\r\nFrench, trusting to the strength of their eastern fortifications, were\r\nrapidly taking troops away from their eastern armies to form a new\r\nFrench army, the Sixth, which was to operate to the north of Paris and\r\nwas to take part in the counter-offensive against the German First and\r\nSecond Armies. This was unknown to the German Command, who thought that\r\nvictory lay within the grasp of their eastern armies.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 30th of August General von Kluck received wireless\r\nmessages from the headquarters of the Second Army reporting a decisive\r\nvictory, and asking the First Army to wheel inwards towards the line La\r\nFere-Laon in order to gain the full advantages of the victory. General\r\nvon Kluck replied that the First Army had wheeled round towards the\r\nOise and would advance on the 31st by Compiegne and Noyon to exploit the\r\nsuccess of the Second Army. This was the much-discussed wheeling\r\nmovement, or swerve, which was discovered by the British from the air.\r\nVon Kluck had been ordered by the German Supreme Command on the 28th to\r\ncontinue his march towards the Lower Seine. Now, in response to von\r\nBuelow's request, he wheeled his army south-eastwards towards the Oise.\r\nThe German Supreme Command was informed of this, and replied, 'The\r\nmovement begun by the First Army is in accordance with the wishes of the\r\nSupreme Command'. The Royal Flying Corps reports of the 31st of August\r\ngave to the British Command the first intimation of what was happening.\r\nHere is one of them:\r\n\r\n  _Date_: 31.8.1914.           _Pilot_: Lieutenant A.

FURSE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map Illustrating Aerial Reconnaissance Area.\r\nAugust 31st 1914.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Captain E. W. Furse, when he picked up the enemy,\r\nfirst observed Marwitz's cavalry corps which crossed the Oise at\r\nThourotte on the morning of the 31st. He then saw part of the German\r\nThird Corps, which, after spending the night in Roye, moved on the 31st\r\nthrough Lassigny, crossed the Oise at Ribecourt, and in the evening\r\nreached Attichy on the Aisne. The remainder of the Third Corps moved on\r\nNoyon and at night reached Vic on the Aisne. These movements on Noyon\r\nand Ribecourt differed in direction from the previous movements of the\r\nGerman left wing.\r\n\r\nThe reports supplement and confirm one another. Captain D. Le G.\r\nPitcher, of No. 4 Squadron, had gone up with Captain A. H. L. Soames\r\nsoon after 7.0 a.m., and had returned at 8.40 a.m. with the news of a\r\ncolumn stretching from Roye to Chevincourt. This information was at once\r\ntelephoned from the aerodrome at Senlis to General Headquarters. The\r\nmovements of some of the other formations of the German First Army were\r\nalso seen to have changed direction. Lieutenant C. G. Hosking and\r\nLieutenant K. P. Atkinson on a B.E. of No. 4 Squadron flew over Roye and\r\nLassigny, confirming the report of movements in that area. Then turning\r\nwest they passed over various columns moving in a southerly direction\r\nuntil they reached the road that follows along the east bank of the\r\nriver Avre from Amiens through Montdidier, and here they found part of\r\nthe German Second Corps. The head of the main body was in Montdidier at\r\n2.0 p.m., and its tail was in La Neuville. Flying south along the road\r\nthey found the advanced guard of the column at Le Ployron.\r\n\r\nAll these air reports left little doubt as to the enemy's movements, and\r\nthe operation orders sent out by General Headquarters from\r\nDammartin-en-Goele at 8.50 p.m. on the 31st of August gave the\r\ninformation that the enemy appeared to have completed his westerly\r\nmovement, and that large columns were advancing in a general southerly\r\nor south-easterly direction on Noyon-Compiegne. Sir John French directed\r\nthat the retirement should be continued on the following day in a\r\nsouth-westerly direction.\r\n\r\nAir reconnaissances of the 1st of September, whilst confirming the news\r\nof von Kluck's wheel in a south-easterly direction, also reported heavy\r\ncolumns as having reached Villers-Cotterets and Crepy-en-Valois. To\r\nwithdraw the British out of reach of a night attack Sir John French\r\ndecided to continue the retreat earlier than he had intended. The corps\r\ncommanders were ordered to get clear by a night march. We know now from\r\nvon Kluck's own statement that, perturbed at leaving the British army on\r\nhis flank, he determined to make another effort to catch them up. He\r\ntherefore ordered his corps to turn south to settle with the British. So\r\non the 1st of September he was again in pursuit of the British, but the\r\nBritish were slipping from his grasp. There was fighting on this day,\r\nwhich held up the pursuit, and by the evening the German army had made\r\nan average advance of no more than ten miles.\r\n\r\nVon Kluck persisted on the following day, but in vain. The British\r\nescaped towards the Marne. 'A chance of dealing a decisive blow', he\r\nsays, 'against the British Army was now no longer to be hoped for,\r\nand it was therefore decided to move the two Corps on the left wing,\r\nthe Third and Ninth, in the general direction of Chateau-Thierry\r\nagainst the flank of the French retreating from Braisne-Fismes on\r\nChateau-Thierry-Dormans in front of the Second Army.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map Illustrating Aerial Reconnaissance Area.\r\n2nd to 9th Sept. 1914.]\r\n\r\nThe air reports which came in on the 3rd of September showed much of\r\nthis further change of plan. Long columns were seen marching almost due\r\neast towards the Ourcq and later in the day other columns were nearing\r\nthe Marne. Some had already crossed the Marne at Chateau-Thierry, whilst\r\nothers were making for crossings west of that town. At 4.35 p.m. General\r\nHeadquarters sent out the following telegram:\r\n\r\n'Present information leads to the belief that the enemy is moving from\r\nwest to east and that no immediate attack is intended. Unless the\r\nsituation again changes troops will remain in their present billets. The\r\nCommander-in-Chief is most anxious that the Army should have a complete\r\nrest to-morrow. No digging or other operations except those necessary\r\nfor protection will be undertaken unless special orders are issued.'\r\n\r\nPilots who went out soon after dawn on the morning of the 4th found a\r\nthick mist over the river Marne extending to the depth of a mile on\r\neither bank, but various columns were seen stirring out of bivouacs on\r\nthe north of the river and there were other movements well to the south\r\nof the river. At 12.20 p.m. Lieutenant R. P. Mills saw movements between\r\nBellot and Rebais and artillery in action on the high ground one mile\r\nsouth-east of Bellot. In the afternoon there came fuller reports of\r\nmovements towards the Petit Morin. The situation as traced at Royal\r\nFlying Corps headquarters on the night of the 4th from observations made\r\nduring the day is very accurate. It shows that the German Ninth Corps,\r\nwhich had secured the crossings at Chateau-Thierry on the previous\r\nevening, had progressed to near Montmirail; that the Third and Fourth\r\nCorps had got well clear of the Marne and were about and across the\r\nPetit Morin; and that the Second Corps and Marwitz's cavalry were held\r\nup at the Marne east of Meaux.\r\n\r\nVon Kluck had marched into a bag between the Fifth French Army on the\r\nMarne and the newly formed Sixth French Army advancing to the Ourcq.\r\nJust at this time the German Supreme Command seems to have become aware\r\nof the danger threatening the German armies on the right wing. On the\r\nnight of the 4th of September orders had been sent out from German First\r\nArmy headquarters at La Ferte Milon, detailing the movements to be made\r\non the following day. These movements had already begun when at 7.15\r\na.m. on the 5th fresh instructions arrived from the Supreme Command\r\nordering the First and Second Armies to remain facing the eastern front\r\nof Paris; the First Army between the Oise and the Marne, occupying the\r\nMarne crossings west of Chateau-Thierry, and the Second Army between the\r\nMarne and the Seine, occupying the Seine crossings from Nogent to Mery.\r\nThis led, says von Kluck, to 'the difficult backwards wheel' of the\r\nFirst Army, and to what he calls 'the important events that occurred\r\nduring the second week of September'--events known to history as the\r\nbattle of the Marne. Von Kluck allowed the original movements ordered\r\nfor the 5th to be carried out, and, he says, 'the conclusion of this\r\nadvance marked the culminating point of the operations of the First\r\nArmy'. On this same day General Joffre told Sir John French that he\r\nintended to take the offensive forthwith as the conditions seemed\r\nfavourable, and on the morning of the 6th this offensive opened.\r\n\r\nThe main work of the Royal Flying Corps throughout the days of the\r\nretreat was reconnaissance, and enough has been said of their reports to\r\nshow that Sir John French was well served by his new arm. He had been\r\nwarned before the battle of Mons, not only of the heavy movement on his\r\nfront but of the enveloping attempt on his flank, and throughout the\r\nretreat he was punctually informed of von Kluck's enveloping efforts.\r\nThe change of direction made on the 31st of August was immediately seen\r\nand reported. Von Kluck's renewed pursuit of the British on the two\r\nfollowing days did not escape observation. Finally, the German swerve to\r\nthe left on the 3rd of September was closely followed from the air.\r\nThese are the main conclusions that come from a study of the air reports\r\nof those days. General Headquarters were perhaps at first a little shy\r\nof trusting the air reports, but they realized their value during the\r\nretreat, and paid more and more attention to them--an attention which\r\nfound practical results in the operation orders issued. The Royal Flying\r\nCorps played their part in helping the British army to escape. Further,\r\nthey were making themselves, and were improving in skill every day. The\r\nlessons learned on the retreat from Mons bore their full fruit at a\r\nlater period, when the officers of the original squadrons held the\r\ncommand of those Flying Corps units which operated in the mobile\r\ncampaigns of distant theatres of the war.\r\n\r\nTheir work during the retreat was done under difficulties. There were\r\nalarms at Compiegne of Uhlans seen in the vicinity of the aerodrome, and\r\na guard was provided from the Camerons. Major B. H. Barrington-Kennett\r\nremarks on the difficulty of defending a Flying Corps camp from attack\r\nby cavalry. It would seem advisable, he says, when camped in an open\r\naerodrome to park the aeroplanes inside a laager formed by lorries and\r\ncars. The head-lights of the cars would lighten a good field of fire,\r\nand would probably, if switched on at the approach of cavalry, cause the\r\nhorses to stampede. The Royal Flying Corps, he adds, should be armed and\r\npractised with machine-guns and rifles, so that they may protect\r\nthemselves without asking for an escort.\r\n\r\nAt Juilly on the 1st of September there was another alarm. The country\r\nto the north was thickly wooded, and German cavalry, which proved later\r\nto be those escaped from the affair at Nery, were reported within a few\r\nmiles, with no British troops between. General Headquarters at\r\nDammartin-en-Goele, some two miles away, hastily took their departure,\r\nand the Royal Flying Corps transport was sent off at once to Serris. But\r\nthe aeroplanes could not leave, for already it was dark. The suggestion\r\nwas made that the aeroplanes should fly off in the dark, but\r\nfortunately, says Major C. J. Burke, this was not attempted. The Flying\r\nCorps stood to arms to defend itself. A sunken road running east and\r\nwest past the aerodrome was occupied, rifles and ammunition were served\r\nout to the mechanics, and machine-guns were set in position. After a\r\ntime a troop of North Irish Horse arrived, to aid in the defence. All\r\nnight watch was kept, but the German cavalry did not appear. In the\r\nmorning, for the first time since the beginning of the retreat, there\r\nwas no ground mist, and the machines got away at once.\r\n\r\nThe history of the retreat is made up of incidents like this. Some of\r\nthe flying officers have kindly communicated their memories and\r\nimpressions. 'The extraordinary part about the retreat', says Wing\r\nCommander P. B. Joubert de la Ferte, 'was the contrasts that one\r\nexperienced from day to day; one night sleeping under a hedge in a\r\nthunder-storm; the next in a comfortable private house; the third in the\r\nmost modern type of hotel with every luxury and convenience, the whole\r\nforming a picture the impression of which has lasted throughout the\r\nwar.... One curious thing was, unless one was brought down or left\r\nbehind near the firing line one never came up against the actual\r\nunpleasantnesses of war, and it was not until the advance to the Aisne\r\nstarted that those of us who had not been on ground duty, or unlucky,\r\nsaw any signs of fighting other than from the air. What we saw during\r\nthe advance confirmed our impressions from the air as to the\r\nunspeakableness of the Hun in his methods of dealing with the civilian\r\npopulation. I saw half a dozen villages on fire during the first day of\r\nthe battle, twenty miles west of Mons, where by no possible means could\r\nthere have been any armed resistance to the passage of the Huns. It was\r\nsimply frightfulness on the part of the Uhlans, and what we saw later on\r\nthe ground at Pezarches, Coulommiers, and La Fere was a clear indication\r\nof wilful and unnecessary destruction of private property. The sight of\r\na draper's shop with every window smashed, every shelf emptied, and the\r\ncontents thrown into the street was quite a common one.'\r\n\r\nMajor F. G. Small says, speaking of the 27th of August: 'The retreat\r\ncontinued to Compiegne Forest, Huns pressing our troops all the while.\r\nOn returning from late reconnaissances in the dusk, it was most\r\ninteresting to watch the local fighting in the roads between their\r\nvanguards and our rearguards. The spreading of fires all over the\r\ncountry around Compiegne Forest was a more curious sight than even the\r\nlater trench offensive, the fires spreading like long flaming worms\r\nalong the main road, as the Huns fired each village they went through.\r\nThe northern portion of Compiegne Forest was blazing at this date.'\r\n\r\nThe speed of the retreat caused some embarrassments. On the 31st of\r\nAugust, while the Flying Corps occupied Senlis racecourse, two officers,\r\nbelonging to Nos. 4 and 5 Squadrons, motored to Paris to get some\r\naircraft spares, and returning in the evening found the Germans in\r\noccupation. In the dusk they were mistaken for German officers and drove\r\ntheir car right up to the cottages which a few hours earlier had been\r\nthe headquarters of the Flying Corps. Aviation teaches quick resource;\r\nthe officers managed to escape.\r\n\r\nThe pilots were not down-hearted. At Compiegne, where they were billeted\r\nin a school, Major Baring records that they were in tearing spirits.\r\nBesides their main duty of observation from the air, they rendered other\r\noccasional services. 'The usual orders on the retreat', says Wing\r\nCommander L. A. Strange, 'were dawn reconnaissances, dropping\r\nhand-grenades and petrol bombs on the enemy, and when it was impossible\r\nto notify pilots of the next aerodrome, the orders were to fly\r\napproximately twenty miles south and look out for the remainder of the\r\nmachines on the ground, if machines had left the last aerodromes.'\r\n\r\nDuring the retreat the dropping of bombs was still in an early\r\nexperimental stage. There were some mildly successful exploits. About\r\ndusk on the 1st of September an unnamed officer of the Flying Corps,\r\nflying over the woods north of Villers-Cotterets, noticed two columns of\r\nthe enemy's cavalry converging at the angle of cross-roads. He dropped\r\ntwo bombs, which caused confusion and a stampede. There was no\r\nbomb-dropping gear in use at this time, but small hand-grenades were\r\ncarried in the pockets, and larger bombs were slung or tied about the\r\nperson. The first experience of German bombs was at Compiegne on the\r\n29th of August; while the Flying Corps were stationed there a German\r\nmachine flew over the aerodrome and dropped three small bombs, which did\r\nno harm. On our side there was no time during the retreat for experiment\r\nwith new devices; it was not until the Germans took up fixed positions\r\non the Aisne that the inventive powers of the Flying Corps got to work\r\non the devising of bombing gear, the improving of artillery observation,\r\nand the mounting of machine-guns.\r\n\r\nThe retreat also witnessed the beginnings of fighting in the air. The\r\nfirst German machine to be seen by the British appeared over the\r\naerodrome at Maubeuge on the 22nd of August. There are various accounts\r\nof this. Major C. J. Burke in his diary says: 'At about 2.25 p.m. an\r\nAlbatross biplane passed over the town. Major Longcroft with Captain\r\nDawes as passenger, Lieutenant Dawes with Major Burke as passenger, on\r\nB.E.'s, gave chase. The gun machine piloted by Lieutenant Strange also\r\nwent out. The machine (Albatross) had far too long a start, and got into\r\na rain cloud.' Wing Commander L. A. Strange says: 'Chased a German\r\nAlbatross machine for forty-five minutes, Lieutenant Penn-Gaskell\r\nobserver, with Lewis gun. Was unable to get higher than 3,500 feet,\r\nwhile the Albatross was at about 5,000 feet. Observed no effect from the\r\nfire. As a result of this received orders to discard Lewis gun and\r\nmounting, and transfer the controls from rear seat to the front seat,\r\nthe passenger to carry rifle in the back seat.' Major J. T. B. McCudden\r\nsays: 'About the 22nd August a strange aeroplane flew over us at about\r\n4,000 feet, and the aerodrome look-out reported it to be a German\r\nmachine, the first we had seen in the War. We all turned out armed with\r\nrifles, and about six machines got ready to go up in pursuit.... All the\r\nmachines which went up were loaded with hand-grenades, as the intention\r\nthen was to bring a hostile aeroplane down by dropping bombs on it. The\r\nGerman easily got away, although it looked at one time as if Captain\r\nLongcroft would be able to intercept him on a B.E. 2 a. About half an\r\nhour after the German had departed a Henri Farman of No. 5 Squadron,\r\nfitted with a machine-gun, was still climbing steadily over the\r\naerodrome at about 1,000 feet in a strenuous endeavour to catch the\r\nBoche.'\r\n\r\nNo. 5 Squadron from the first had been zealous in experimenting with\r\nmachine-guns. Experience of fighting in the air, which began with this\r\nadventure, soon taught how enormous is the advantage, whether for attack\r\nor escape, given by superiority in height.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until the 25th of August that an enemy machine was\r\nbrought down by a British aeroplane. Sir John French in his first\r\ndispatch, dated the 7th of September 1914, alludes to the earliest\r\ncombats. His tribute must be quoted in full: 'I wish particularly to\r\nbring to your Lordships' notice the admirable work done by the Royal\r\nFlying Corps under Sir David Henderson. Their skill, energy, and\r\nperseverance have been beyond all praise. They have furnished me with\r\nthe most complete and accurate information, which has been of\r\nincalculable value in the conduct of operations. Fired at constantly\r\nboth by friend and foe, and not hesitating to fly in every kind of\r\nweather, they have remained undaunted throughout. Further, by actually\r\nfighting in the air, they have succeeded in destroying five of the\r\nenemy's machines.'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately during the retreat combat reports were not made out, so\r\nthat there is no account in the war diaries of the actual fighting. Some\r\nof the fights are mentioned. On the 25th of August three machines of No.\r\n2 Squadron chased an enemy monoplane. It was forced to land; Lieutenant\r\nH. D. Harvey-Kelly and Lieutenant W. H. C. Mansfield landed near it and\r\ncontinued the chase on foot, but the Germans escaped into a wood. When\r\nsome trophies had been taken from the machine it was burnt. Another\r\nGerman machine was forced to descend on the same day near Le Quesnoy,\r\nwhere it was captured. Aeroplanes at this time had no special armament;\r\nofficers carried revolvers and sometimes a carbine; but the confidence\r\nand determination with which they attacked did the work of a\r\nmachine-gun, and brought the enemy down. In one instance, a little later\r\non, a British pilot and observer, who were destitute of ammunition,\r\nsucceeded by manoeuvring boldly above a German machine in bringing it to\r\nthe ground and taking it captive.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 5th of September neither the German Supreme\r\nCommand (which had its headquarters at Luxembourg) nor the staff of the\r\nGerman First Army had any idea that an offensive of the whole French\r\narmy was imminent. The Supreme Command was expecting a decisive victory\r\nin the east against the Verdun-Nancy-St.-Die defences. They believed\r\nthat the German First and Second Armies could easily hold the weak\r\nFrench forces around Paris until this decision should be achieved, and\r\nthey did not know how great a part of the French strength had been\r\ntransferred from the east to the west. From the 5th to the 9th of\r\nSeptember they issued no orders to their First and Second Armies, who\r\nwere left to fight out the decisive battle of the war, without their\r\nhelp and almost without their knowledge, against superior forces.\r\n\r\nGeneral Joffre's 'Instruction' for the offensive on the 6th was brought\r\nto British General Headquarters by a French staff officer at 3 a.m. on\r\nthe morning of the 5th. Unfortunately, orders to the British army to\r\ncontinue the retreat in accordance with General Joffre's previous\r\ninstructions had already been given to the corps commanders. The Second\r\nCorps had moved off before midnight and the First and Third Corps a\r\nlittle later. Consequently the British army by the end of the day was\r\nsome twelve to fifteen miles farther back than the French\r\nCommander-in-Chief expected, and although its subsequent advance across\r\nthe Marne had a decisive effect, the hard fighting of the battle was\r\nborne by the French army on the Ourcq. During the 5th, General Maunoury,\r\ncommanding the Sixth French Army on the British left, and later on\r\nGeneral Joffre himself, visited Sir John French, and all arrangements\r\nfor the morrow's offensive were discussed. Sir John French's operation\r\norders issued at 5.15 p.m. on the 5th of September directed the army to\r\nadvance eastward with a view to attacking. The preliminary movement of\r\nthe British army, a wheel to the east, pivoting on its right, was to be\r\ncompleted by the right wing at 9 a.m. and by the left wing at 10 a.m. on\r\nthe 6th.\r\n\r\nOn the early morning of the 6th Sir John French gave verbal instructions\r\nthat the Royal Flying Corps were to send aeroplanes to report for\r\nreconnaissance direct to the First and Second Corps. The officer\r\ncommanding No. 5 Squadron, with three machines, was to report for\r\ntactical reconnaissance direct to Sir Douglas Haig at Chaubuisson farm,\r\none and a half miles east of Fontenay; and the officer commanding No. 3\r\nSquadron, also with three machines, was to report direct to Sir Horace\r\nSmith-Dorrien at Combreux Chateau, near Tournan. With each detachment\r\nwas to go a wireless aeroplane from No. 4 Squadron to keep Royal Flying\r\nCorps headquarters informed by wireless. The machines were to return to\r\nheadquarters at night. This was the beginning of the decentralization of\r\nthe Royal Flying Corps, whereby certain squadrons, which came to be\r\ncalled corps squadrons, were attached to the corps commands. The German\r\nair service from the beginning had been thus organized. With the German\r\nFirst Army headquarters there was one aeroplane section for\r\nlong-distance strategic reconnaissance and each of the corps, with the\r\nexception of the Fourth Reserve Corps, had its own section for tactical\r\nwork. From Maubeuge to the Marne the squadrons of the Royal Flying Corps\r\nhad been kept together under the immediate control of General Henderson.\r\nThe experiment of detaching machines to report direct to the First and\r\nSecond Corps worked well on the 6th of September, and Sir John French\r\ngave orders that this arrangement was to continue.\r\n\r\nAeroplanes which were sent out on the morning of the 6th brought\r\ninformation of confused movements of the German First Army. On the\r\nBritish front a certain amount of movement northwards was seen in the\r\nafternoon. Of the progress of the battle on his flanks Sir John French\r\nhad little knowledge. Aeroplanes were sent up to reconnoitre the\r\nposition. One which flew over the area of the Sixth French Army west of\r\nthe Ourcq saw at about five o'clock a good deal of movement and shells\r\nbursting in the area Etavigny-Marcilly-May-en-Multien. Another machine\r\nwhich flew along the line of the Fifth French Army on the British right\r\ncame back with the information that at four o'clock fighting was going\r\non south of Esternay and north of Villiers-St.-Georges. By seven o'clock\r\nthat evening Sir John French had no definite news of the progress of the\r\nFrench armies on his wings save what was contained in these air reports,\r\nand the orders which he issued stated simply that all troops should be\r\nready to move at any time after 8.0 a.m. on the morrow.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 7th the situation became clearer; a general retirement of\r\nthe Germans on the British front was in progress. Sir John French had\r\nissued orders at 8.0 a.m. for the advance to be continued in the\r\ndirection of Rebais, the army to move in echelon from the right and to\r\nattack the enemy wherever met. Aeroplanes on morning reconnaissance\r\nreturned soon after the army began to move with information of early\r\nactivity behind the German lines and general movement northwards. Later\r\nin the morning columns were seen moving in a north-westerly direction\r\ntowards the Ourcq. These reconnaissances seemed to show that von Kluck\r\nwas hurriedly withdrawing two of his corps--the Second and the\r\nFourth--to reinforce his right wing across the Ourcq.\r\n\r\nEarly reconnaissances on the 8th told of congested movement over the\r\nbridge at La Ferte-sous-Jouarre, south of which masses of troops were\r\nawaiting their turn to cross. But the British advance was necessarily\r\nslow. The country was well suited to rearguard actions and skilful use\r\nwas made of the ground by the German machine-gunners. By the evening the\r\nBritish had forced the passage of the Petit Morin, but they spent the\r\nnight south of the Marne. Meantime, as air reports showed, von Kluck's\r\nright was heavily engaged by Maunoury's Sixth Army to the west of the\r\nOurcq. On the night of the 8th General Joffre, taking advantage of the\r\nwithdrawal of the two German corps from the British front, ordered that\r\nMaunoury's army should hold the enemy troops on the right bank of the\r\nOurcq, whilst the British on the following day should advance across the\r\nMarne between Nogent l'Artaud and La Ferte-sous-Jouarre against the left\r\nand rear of the enemy on the Ourcq. The Marne with its steep wooded\r\nsides was well suited to rearguard actions and a stubborn resistance was\r\nexpected. But air observers who came in early on the morning of the 9th\r\nbrought back the news of enemy columns formed up facing in a northerly\r\ndirection. Some were already on the move, and it became apparent that\r\nthe enemy intended no determined, but only a delaying stand on the\r\nMarne.\r\n\r\nCaptain D. Le G. Pitcher, piloted by Lieutenant G. W. Mapplebeck, whilst\r\nreconnoitring near Chateau-Thierry about 12.45 p.m. saw large bodies of\r\nenemy troops in the neighbourhood of Chateau-Thierry and infantry moving\r\non Domptin. This position was west of the British Third Infantry\r\nBrigade, and the whole of the First Corps was ordered to halt until the\r\nsituation should be cleared up. The First Corps did not move forward\r\nagain until 3.0 p.m. By the evening of the 9th the First and Second\r\nCorps were across the Marne, but the Third Corps on the left had been\r\nheld up and was mostly south of the river. General Maunoury had had a\r\nhard fight, but by the late afternoon the Germans, pressed by the\r\nadvance of the British across the Marne, had begun to retire in a\r\nnorth-easterly direction. Captain R. A. Boger, piloted by Captain R.\r\nGrey, brought this welcome news direct to the General Officer Commanding\r\nthe Third Corps (Lieutenant-General W. P. Pulteney) at 5.0 p.m. He had\r\nseen long columns moving north-east from Lizy through Ocquerre on to\r\nCoulombs. This was believed to be von Kluck's Fifth Division. Other\r\nobservers came in with similar information. By the evening of the 9th\r\nthe retirement of the enemy was general from the Ourcq to Verdun. The\r\nbattle of the Marne was won. The German armies retired, with no very\r\ngreat disorder, to strong positions along the heights of the northern\r\nbank of the river Aisne. Paris was saved; for the first time for over a\r\nhundred years an invading Prussian army had been turned and driven back;\r\nbut the war was yet to come.\r\n\r\nDuring the battle the Royal Flying Corps had been active over the enemy,\r\nand, as has been shown, reported his movements fully day by day. The\r\nmachines which worked direct with the corps had supplied much useful\r\ntactical information, which was passed on direct to the corps commanders\r\nas soon as the machines landed. The observers usually reported by word\r\nof mouth, and so were able to convey a full and true impression. They\r\nreported which river-bridges were broken and which intact, and they\r\ndropped messages on to the advanced British infantry in places, warning\r\nthem of danger ahead. They sometimes located for corps commanders the\r\nhead of the leading troops of their corps. After a three days' stay at\r\nMelun, the headquarters of the Flying Corps moved on the 7th of\r\nSeptember to Touquin--the first move forward since the retreat from\r\nMons. At Pezarches, about a mile away, a field was chosen for an\r\naerodrome. Fighting had taken place there, and small one-man trenches\r\nhad to be filled in before any machine could land. On the 9th of\r\nSeptember headquarters moved forward again to Coulommiers, and on the\r\n12th to Fere-en-Tardenois, which place became the headquarters for the\r\nbattle of the Aisne. Here the squadrons were established at Saponay,\r\nsome two miles to the north-west. For many long months and years the\r\nFlying Corps was not again to be employed in a war of movement against a\r\npowerful European army, so that the work they did from the time when\r\nthey arrived at Maubeuge to the time when they settled at\r\nFere-en-Tardenois has a unique value. The French Commander-in-Chief paid\r\ntribute to their skill. His message ran: 'Please express most\r\nparticularly to Marshal French my thanks for the services rendered to us\r\nevery day by the English Flying Corps. The precision, exactitude, and\r\nregularity of the news brought in by them are evidence of their perfect\r\norganization and also of the perfect training of pilots and observers.'\r\n\r\nThe weather during the early part of the Marne battle had been excellent\r\nfor flying. The air had been still and the heat tropical. On the 9th of\r\nSeptember, the critical day of the battle, the weather broke, and for\r\nthe next few days there were violent storms and heavy rains which\r\ngreatly impeded air work of any sort. The worst of these storms occurred\r\non the night of the 12th of September, when the squadrons had newly\r\narrived at Saponay. Four machines of No. 5 Squadron were completely\r\nwrecked, and others damaged. Lieutenant L. A. Strange saved his Henri\r\nFarman machine, which had made a forced landing, by pushing it up\r\nagainst a haystack, laying a ladder over the front skids, and piling\r\nlarge paving-stones on the ladder, using hay twisted into ropes for\r\ntying down the machine. A diary of No. 3 Squadron records that when the\r\nmachines of that squadron arrived at Saponay, about five hours before\r\nthe transport, 'a terrible storm was raging, and before anything could\r\nbe done to make the machines more secure the wind shifted, and about\r\nhalf the total number of machines were over on their backs. One Henri\r\nFarman went up about thirty feet in the air and crashed on top of\r\nanother Henri Farman in a hopeless tangle. B.E.'s of No. 2 Squadron were\r\nblowing across the aerodrome, and when daylight arrived and the storm\r\nabated, the aerodrome presented a pitiful sight. The Royal Flying Corps\r\nin the field had probably not more than ten machines serviceable that\r\nmorning.... Hangars were not yet issued.' The protection of machines\r\nfrom accidents like this became comparatively easy when the line of\r\nbattle was stabilized and fixed aerodromes were made.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 13th of September, the Allied armies had crossed the\r\nAisne, but were held up by the enemy line of defence which, ran along\r\nthe heights from east of Compiegne to north of Rheims. There was dogged\r\nfighting, with attacks and counter-attacks, but little or no progress\r\nwas made. The Germans had regained the initiative, and the British army\r\nwas forced to dig itself in along the line of battle. On the 18th of\r\nSeptember General Joffre changed his plans and began to push forces up\r\non the Allied left in order to envelop the German right flank. To give\r\nthis movement a chance the enemy had to be held on the front, and the\r\ncavalry were called on to take their turn in the trenches--a duty which\r\nbefore long became very familiar to them. But the Germans extended and\r\nreinforced their line for a similar outflanking movement. These\r\nenveloping attempts did not cease until the opposing armies were ranged\r\nalong a line of trenches stretching from the Swiss frontier to the coast\r\nof Belgium.\r\n\r\nDuring the battle of the Aisne, from the 12th to the 15th of September,\r\nthe British forced the passage of the river and captured the Aisne\r\nheights including the Chemin des Dames. Thereafter fighting degenerated\r\ninto a sullen trench warfare, culminating on the 26th of September and\r\nthe two following days in a series of fierce attacks by the Germans.\r\nThese attacks were repulsed and were not again renewed.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of September Lieutenant L. Dawes and Lieutenant W. R.\r\nFreeman, of No. 2 Squadron, had a notable adventure. They left in the\r\nmorning to carry out an aerial reconnaissance to St.-Quentin. A little\r\nsouth of Anizy-le-Chateau, between Soissons and Laon, their machine\r\nbegan to rock and vibrate in the air, as if the tail were loose. They\r\nplaned down at once, and landed in a small field, finishing up in a\r\nwood, where they damaged their undercarriage, wings, and airscrew. Large\r\nGerman columns were on the roads on both sides of them, within about two\r\nhundred yards. Taking only a biscuit and some tubes of beef extract with\r\nthem, they hid in another wood close by. Some German cavalry came up to\r\nthe machine, and then went all round the first wood, but found nothing,\r\nand after an hour and a half went away. The two officers lay hid until\r\nthe evening, and then started in the direction of the Aisne, some eight\r\nmiles distant. During the night they passed several German pickets, but\r\nthe war was young, the spirit of exhilaration still prevailed in the\r\nGerman army, and the pickets were making so much noise that they passed\r\nunobserved. At 3.0 in the morning they reached the Aisne, where they lay\r\ndown and slept. At 6.0 they were wakened by the firing of a gun close\r\nby, and realized that they were in front of the German position. German\r\ncavalry patrolled the road in front of them, and they were under heavy\r\nshell-fire from the British. They swam the Aisne, dried their clothes in\r\na house by the canal, and then walked to the British guns, which were\r\nstill in action. They were given food by the Third Cavalry Brigade, and\r\nwere taken back on a supply column to rejoin their squadron after an\r\nabsence of more than two days. It might be supposed that their troubles\r\nwere now at an end, but they had yet to face their squadron commander,\r\nMajor Burke, who sternly rebuked them for violating the order that no\r\ntwo pilots should fly together in the same machine.\r\n\r\nThe work of observation now entered a new phase. When armies are in\r\nfixed positions movement behind the front and along the lines of\r\ncommunication does not greatly vary from day to day. The Flying Corps\r\nwere employed to map out the enemy's chief railheads, his aerodromes\r\n(which were surprisingly numerous), his camps, and his dumps. They began\r\nalso to observe the positions of enemy batteries in order to range them\r\nfor our own artillery, and they made some attempts to take photographs\r\nfrom the air of the enemy trenches and lines of communication.\r\n\r\nMaubeuge had fallen on the 7th of September and, in addition to the\r\nSeventh Reserve Corps and other troops, the siege artillery which had\r\nbeen used to reduce Maubeuge was brought down to the Aisne, and the\r\nBritish guns were outranged and outnumbered. The spotting of hostile\r\nbatteries became an operation of the first importance, and the Flying\r\nCorps quickly rose to its opportunities. When trench warfare began, the\r\naeroplanes attached to corps commands took up artillery officers daily\r\nfrom each division over the German batteries. The positions of these\r\nbatteries were noted on maps, and the maps were sent in every day to the\r\ndivisional artillery commander, who allotted the targets to his\r\nbatteries. When any part of the British lines was shelled, information\r\nwas obtained from the air and orders were given to those of our\r\nbatteries which could best reply, to concentrate on the enemy's guns.\r\nThe wireless machines of No. 4 Squadron had been attached to the army\r\ncorps direct during the battle of the Marne, but their opportunities had\r\nbeen few. On the Aisne they were first used to observe for the\r\nartillery. Two pioneers of wireless telegraphy are associated in work\r\nand in memory with these early attempts at wireless co-operation with\r\nthe artillery--Lieutenants Lewis and James. Donald Swain Lewis had\r\njoined the Royal Engineers in 1904, and, after qualifying as a pilot in\r\nMay 1912, had transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in December 1913. By\r\nexample and precept he had done all that he could before the war to\r\nadapt wireless telegraphy to the uses of the Flying Corps and to\r\nconvince others of its necessity. Before the battle of the Aisne ended\r\nhe had won his victory. He was in the habit of going out alone in a B.E.\r\nmachine, piloting the machine and operating the wireless at the same\r\ntime. A brother-officer noted of him in a diary: 'Lewis, R.E., came in\r\nfrom spotting with his machine shot full of holes; I believe he likes\r\nit!' Later on in the war, at home and in the field, he continued his\r\nwork. In April 1915 he was appointed to command No. 3 Squadron, in\r\nsuccession to Major J. M. Salmond, and did much to maintain and advance\r\nthe great reputation of that pioneer among squadrons. After a spell at\r\nhome during the winter of 1915-16, he returned to France in February\r\n1916, to command the Second Wing, co-operating with the Second Army in\r\nthe Ypres salient. By this time he held the rank of lieutenant-colonel,\r\nbut he continued to fly over the enemy lines. On the 10th of April 1916,\r\nflying a Morane parasol, east of Wytschaete, with Captain A. W. Gale, an\r\nofficer of the Trench Mortars, as passenger, he was brought down by a\r\ndirect hit from the enemy's anti-aircraft guns. He had been showing\r\nCaptain Gale some of the objectives on which the trench mortar fire had\r\nbeen directed during the week, and was killed in action while he was\r\ncarrying out the duties of that artillery observation which he had done\r\nso much to perfect.\r\n\r\nBaron Trevenen James had been a mathematical scholar and head of his\r\nHouse at Harrow; in 1907 he passed into Woolwich, and two years later\r\nwas commissioned in the Royal Engineers. He was early interested in\r\naviation; in June 1912, after only three days' practice, he obtained the\r\nRoyal Aero Club certificate at Hendon, flying a Howard Wright biplane.\r\nIn April 1913 he joined the Military Wing of the Royal Flying Corps, and\r\nwas at once employed in carrying out experiments with wireless. In\r\nDecember 1913 he was joined by Lieutenant Lewis, and the two became\r\nfamous for the theory and practice of their craft. On the outbreak of\r\nwar Lieutenant James was attached to No. 4 Squadron for wireless duties;\r\nwhen in September 1914 the headquarters wireless telegraphy unit was\r\nformed, under the command of Major H. Musgrave, at Fere-en-Tardenois,\r\nLieutenant James was attached to it, and shared with Lieutenant Lewis\r\nthe duty of reporting by wireless over the fire of the enemy guns. Like\r\nLieutenant Lewis, he was subsequently killed in the air. On the 13th of\r\nJuly 1915 his commanding officer reports: 'He was observing from the\r\naeroplane alone, as he generally did. He was ranging a battery, and was\r\nbeing heavily shelled. His machine was hit by a shell, and was seen to\r\ndive to the ground from a great height. The Germans dropped a note from\r\none of their machines saying that he was dead when he fell.... He met\r\nthe end I am sure he would have wished for--if it had to be--suddenly,\r\nalone, and doing his duty.'\r\n\r\nThese two, then, Lieutenants Lewis and James, had been untiring in their\r\nenthusiasm and perseverance during the years before the war. On the\r\nAisne their reward was granted them. 'I wish to express', says General\r\nSir Horace Smith-Dorrien in a telegram dated the 27th of September 1914,\r\n'my great admiration for the splendid work the Royal Flying Corps is\r\ndoing for my Corps from day to day. Nothing prevents them from obtaining\r\nthe required information, and they frequently return with rifle or\r\nshrapnel bullets through their aeroplane or even their clothing, without\r\nconsidering such, to them, ordinary incidents as worth mentioning.\r\nTo-day I watched for a long time an aeroplane observing for the six-inch\r\nhowitzers for the Third Division. It was, at times, smothered with\r\nhostile anti-aircraft guns, but, nothing daunted, it continued for hours\r\nthrough a wireless installation to observe the fire and indeed to\r\ncontrol the Battery with most satisfactory results. I am not mentioning\r\nnames, as to do so, where all are daily showing such heroic and\r\nefficient work, would be invidious.' Lieutenants Lewis and James are now\r\nbeyond the voices of envy, and their names may fitly be recorded in the\r\nmemory of their country.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest of the messages sent down by wireless from the air\r\nis dated the 24th of September 1914. It is worthy of full quotation:\r\n\r\n  4.2 p.m.   A very little short. Fire. Fire.\r\n  4.4 p.m.   Fire again. Fire again.\r\n  4.12 p.m.  A little short; line O.K.\r\n  4.15 p.m.  Short. Over, over and a little left.\r\n  4.20 p.m.  You were just between two batteries. Search two\r\n             hundred yards each side of your last shot.\r\n             Range O.K.\r\n  4.22 p.m.  You have them.\r\n  4.26 p.m.  Hit. Hit. Hit.\r\n  4.32 p.m.  About 50 yards short and to the right.\r\n  4.37 p.m.  Your last shot in the middle of 3 batteries in action;\r\n             search all round within 300 yards of your last\r\n             shot and you have them.\r\n  4.42 p.m.  I am coming home now.\r\n\r\nThe later signals directing artillery fire were not so full of colour\r\nas these early messages. They consisted of code letters. The clock code\r\nfor signalling the results of artillery fire was first used in 1915 and\r\nafterwards generally throughout the war. The target was taken as the\r\ncentre of a clock and imaginary lines were circumscribed around it at\r\ndistances of 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 yards. These lines\r\nwere lettered Y, Z, A, B, C, D, E, F, respectively. Twelve o'clock was\r\nalways taken as true north from the target and the remaining hours\r\naccordingly. An observer noted the fall of the rounds with reference to\r\nthe imaginary circles and clock-hours and signalled the result, for\r\ninstance, as Y 4, or C 6. A direct hit was O.K, and there were other\r\nsignals. Messages from the battery or any other ground station were\r\nsignalled to the observer in the aeroplane by means of white strips\r\nwhich were laid out on the ground to form the letters of a code.\r\n\r\nDuring the battle of the Aisne, the wireless machines were few in number\r\nand other methods of signalling were mostly in use. On the 15th of\r\nSeptember Captain L. E. O. Charlton fired Very lights over enemy guns\r\npreviously observed. On the 24th of September 'Lieutenant Allen and two\r\nothers with aeroplanes indicated targets and observed fire,\r\ncommunication being by flash signals'. Sometimes the pilots returned and\r\nlanded to report on gun positions. But when once the gunners had\r\nprofited by the superior accuracy and speed of report by wireless, they\r\nwere hungry for more machines. On the 23rd of September the commander of\r\nthe Second Corps telegraphed to General Headquarters: 'I hope that you\r\nwill be able to spare the wireless aeroplane and receiving set to Third\r\nDivision again to-morrow. The results were so good yesterday that it\r\nseems a pity not to keep it with the Division, which has got accustomed\r\nto its uses and is in a position to benefit even more largely by the\r\nexperience gained.' The answer was that the machine had been damaged by\r\nanti-aircraft fire, but would be ready again shortly. A wireless\r\naeroplane was as popular as an opera-singer, and the headquarters\r\nwireless section soon developed into No. 9 Squadron of the Royal Flying\r\nCorps. The attitude of the gunners may be well seen in an entry made in\r\nthe war diary of No. 3 Siege Battery, dated the 23rd of January\r\n1915--'Airman' (Captain Cherry) 'reported for co-operation (lamp only,\r\nalas!).'\r\n\r\nThe photography was a mere beginning. On the 15th of September\r\nLieutenant G. F. Pretyman took five photographs of the enemy positions;\r\nthese were developed later on the ground, and were the forerunners of\r\nthat immense photographic map of the western front in thousands of\r\nsections, constantly renewed and corrected, which played so great a part\r\nin the later stages of the war. Some other experiments had no later\r\nhistory. Steel darts called 'flechettes', about five inches long and\r\nthree-eighths of an inch in diameter, were dropped over enemy\r\nhorse-lines and troops by No. 3 Squadron. A canister holding about 250\r\nof these darts was fixed under the fuselage; by the pulling of a wire\r\nthe bottom of the tin was opened and the darts were released. To do any\r\nharm these darts had to score a direct hit on some living object, so\r\nthat a whole canister of them was probably a less formidable weapon than\r\na bomb. Even on a battle-field life is sparsely distributed on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThere was hardly any fighting in the air during the battle of the Aisne,\r\nand reconnaissance machines were not attacked by other aeroplanes. They\r\nwere fired at from the ground by anti-aircraft artillery. The\r\nanti-aircraft guns got their name of 'Archies' from a light-hearted\r\nBritish pilot, who when he was fired at in the air quoted a popular\r\nmusic-hall refrain--'Archibald, certainly not!' The Germans used kite\r\nballoons for observation. In the attempt to drop a bomb on one of these\r\nLieutenant G. W. Mapplebeck was attacked, on the 22nd of September, by a\r\nGerman Albatross, and was wounded in the leg. He was the first of our\r\npilots to be wounded in the air from an enemy aeroplane--a long list it\r\nwas to be.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Flying Corps were few indeed in comparison with the air forces\r\nopposed to them, but they were full of zeal and initiative. On the 19th\r\nof September they received a valued compliment from the French General\r\nStaff, who asked the British Commander-in-Chief to permit them to carry\r\nout reconnaissances along the front of the Fifth French Army. This was\r\nalready being done, but Sir David Henderson promised to take measures to\r\nmake the reconnaissance more complete.\r\n\r\nIn the battle of the Aisne the British forces were co-operating with\r\nGeneral Maunoury's Sixth French Army on their left. The so-called race\r\nfor the sea was, in fact, a race for the flank of the opposing army. On\r\nthe 20th of September De Castelnau's army formed up on the left of\r\nMaunoury and at first made some progress, but was pushed back by the\r\nreinforced army of General von Buelow, and was held on a line extending\r\nfrom Ribecourt on the Oise to Albert. On the 30th of September General\r\nMaud'huy's army came into position on the left of De Castelnau, along a\r\nline extending from Albert to Lens, while at the same time cavalry and\r\nterritorials occupied Lille and Douai on the German right. This army in\r\nits turn was opposed by the German Sixth Army sent up from Metz, which\r\npushed the French behind Arras, occupied Lens and Douai, and began to\r\nshell Lille. General Maud'huy could do no more than fight to hold his\r\nground till another army should come to his relief on his left. For this\r\npurpose the British army was shifted from the Aisne to its natural\r\nposition in defence of the Channel ports, and came into action along a\r\nline extending northwards from La Bassee. The actual line was fixed by\r\na series of fierce engagements culminating in the battles of Ypres,\r\n1914.\r\n\r\nThe Allied plan was to hold the French and Belgian coast and to take the\r\noffensive in the north. With this purpose in view the Seventh Division\r\nof the British army and the Third Cavalry Division, both of which came\r\nunder the command of Sir Henry Rawlinson, were disembarked, from the 6th\r\nof October onward, at Zeebrugge and Ostend. But Antwerp was taken by the\r\nGermans on the 9th of October, and the first business of this famous\r\nforce was to cover the Belgian retreat along the coast. The German\r\nFourth Army was being rapidly pushed forward into Belgium; Lille\r\ncapitulated on the 13th of October; Zeebrugge and Ostend were occupied\r\nby the Germans on the 15th. Still the idea of a counter-offensive was\r\nnot abandoned, and the works and defences of Zeebrugge were left intact\r\nin the hope of its speedy recapture. On the night of the 1st of October\r\nthe British army had begun to move northwards from the Aisne. By the 9th\r\nof October the British Second Corps had detrained at Abbeville and\r\nreceived orders to march on Bethune; on the 12th the Third Corps began\r\ndetraining and concentrating at St.-Omer and Hazebrouck, and\r\nsubsequently moved up to Bailleul and Armentieres. A week later, on the\r\n19th, the First Corps under Sir Douglas Haig detrained at Hazebrouck and\r\nmoved on Ypres. General Headquarters left Fere-en-Tardenois on the 8th\r\nof October and after a five-days' stay at Abbeville established\r\nthemselves at St.-Omer.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Flying Corps had moved north with the British Expeditionary\r\nForce, from Fere-en-Tardenois by way of Abbeville, to St.-Omer, where\r\nthey were established by the 12th of October. No. 2 Squadron remained\r\nbehind for a few days, to carry on with Sir Douglas Haig's corps on the\r\nAisne, but joined up at St.-Omer on the 17th of October. In addition to\r\nthe four original squadrons, No. 6 Squadron, newly arrived from England\r\nunder Major J. H. W. Becke, came under Brigadier-General Henderson's\r\norders on the 16th of October. This squadron had been stationed at South\r\nFarnborough as a reserve for the squadrons in the field. When General\r\nRawlinson's force was sent to Ostend, to attempt the relief of Antwerp,\r\nLord Kitchener said, 'I want a squadron to go with it'. He ordered that\r\nNo. 6 Squadron should be ready in forty-eight hours. The squadron was\r\nhastily completed; some pilots and machines were obtained from the\r\nCentral Flying School; some machines were bought from private firms;\r\nequipment, tools, and the like were collected at night; and on the 7th\r\nof October the squadron flew to Bruges and began at once to carry out\r\nreconnaissances. On the following day they flew to Ostend, and, their\r\ntransport having arrived, were concentrated on the racecourse. Five days\r\nlater they retired to Dunkirk, and by the 16th of October were\r\nestablished at Poperinghe, where they came under the orders of\r\nheadquarters at St.-Omer.\r\n\r\nA good deal of reconnaissance was carried on by the squadrons during the\r\nnorthward move of the army. On the 29th of September unusual and heavy\r\nmovement in a northerly and north-westerly direction had been observed\r\nbehind the enemy lines on the Aisne. On the 1st of October air\r\nreconnaissances showed that the trenches in front of the British First\r\nArmy Corps were unoccupied or very lightly held, and during the next few\r\ndays there were many indications that one or two German army corps were\r\nbeing withdrawn to the north. Meantime the enemy took more trouble than\r\nusual to interfere with our aircraft, and employed an increased number\r\nof anti-aircraft guns. In the north our strategic reconnaissances were\r\nnot so successful, and the formidable enemy movement against the Ypres\r\nline developed undetected. Not many aeroplanes were available at this\r\ntime for the wider sort of strategic reconnaissance. Nos. 2, 3, and 5\r\nSquadrons had been attached, by an order issued on the 1st of October,\r\nto the First, Second, and Third Army Corps respectively, while No. 4\r\nSquadron was detailed for strategical reconnaissance. The General\r\nOfficers Commanding army corps had learned the value of aeroplanes and\r\ndemanded their assistance. Much of the country over which they were\r\noperating in Northern France and Flanders was flat and enclosed,\r\nunsuitable either way for cavalry reconnaissance.\r\n\r\nLong-distance work was done chiefly from headquarters. On the 3rd of\r\nOctober, when the situation at Antwerp had become critical,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel F. H. Sykes flew direct to Bruges from\r\nFere-en-Tardenois, with a message from Sir John French to the Belgian\r\nChief of Staff at Antwerp. On the following day he returned and reported\r\nthat the Germans had broken through the south-eastern sector of the\r\nouter defences of Antwerp, that the Belgians were awaiting help, and\r\nthat they might possibly hold out for two or three weeks. In forwarding\r\nthe report to Lord Kitchener Sir John French adds, 'The relief of\r\nAntwerp I regard as my first objective'. This mission was followed by\r\nothers, and a few days later Sir John French speaks of reports which he\r\nis receiving daily by air from General Rawlinson.\r\n\r\nMeantime a squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service, as shall be told in\r\nthe next chapter, had been operating for some weeks from Ostend and\r\nDunkirk with French territorial forces. The French territorials were\r\nhastily embodied troops taken from civilian life and were not of much\r\nuse for a fight against odds. When the Seventh Division was landed at\r\nOstend and Zeebrugge during the first week of October, and the\r\nimprovised British Naval Division arrived at Antwerp, the situation was\r\nalready out of hand. The British army was small; it had helped to save\r\nParis, and now paid the price in the loss of the Belgian coast. The\r\nSeventh Division occupied Ghent, and after covering the retreat of the\r\nBelgian army, which halted along the line of the Yser, from Dixmude to\r\nNieuport, fell back by way of Roulers to a position east of Ypres. When\r\nthe whole British force came into line, it held a front of some\r\nthirty-five miles, with Maud'huy's Tenth French Army on its right across\r\nthe Bethune-Lille road. On its left the line was held, from a point\r\nnorth of Ypres to the sea, by the Belgian army, assisted by four French\r\ncavalry divisions under General De Mitry.\r\n\r\nThe German army had failed to take Paris; all its efforts were now\r\nconcentrated on the seizure of the Channel ports, and its pressure on\r\nthe defending line was like the pressure of a great rising head of\r\nwaters against the gates of a lock. The glory of the defence belongs to\r\nthe infantry. The men who flew above them could only watch them and help\r\nthem with eyes. The infantry were often unconscious of this help; they\r\ndisliked seeing hostile observers above them and often fired on\r\naeroplanes with very little distinction made between friends and foes.\r\nOn the 26th of October Major G. H. Raleigh, of No. 4 Squadron, reports\r\nan artillery reconnaissance as follows: 'Hosking and Crean did a\r\ntactical reconnaissance early, but were unable to locate batteries owing\r\nto clouds. They went up later and did it. The clouds were low, so it was\r\narranged that they should fly over one of our batteries to observe for\r\nranging. The machine came down in flames and was completely demolished.\r\nPilot and passenger had both been wounded by our own infantry fire when\r\nat a height of about a thousand feet with the large Union Jack plainly\r\nvisible.'\r\n\r\nWing Commander W. D. Beatty tells how, before this time, the\r\ndisadvantage of the Union Jack marking on the planes was becoming\r\nevident. The officer in command of an aviation camp at Paris had pointed\r\nout to him that, at a height, only the red cross of the Union Jack was\r\nclearly visible, and that it was mistaken by the French for the German\r\nmarking. A suggestion was made that the British should adopt the French\r\ncircular marking. The mishap of the 26th of October hastened the\r\nadoption of this suggestion, and thereafter the French target was\r\npainted on British aeroplanes, with the alteration only of blue for red\r\nand red for blue, to preserve national distinctions.\r\n\r\nCommanding officers sometimes complained that our machines were little\r\nin evidence. The aeroplane observers, operating over enemy territory,\r\nreported to their own command, and their reports, forwarded to the\r\nproper quarters, took effect in the orders issued by Headquarters, so\r\nthat crucial improvements were sometimes made in our dispositions, by\r\ninformation obtained from the air, though the infantry had seen no\r\nmachine in the air above them. The use of machines for more local needs,\r\nsuch as artillery ranging, hastened the recognition of the services\r\nrendered by the Flying Corps, and brought it into closer touch with the\r\nother arms. Photographic cameras and fittings were still very imperfect,\r\nand photography from the air was not much practised, but sketch-maps of\r\nenemy trenches and gun-pits, as located by air reconnaissances, were\r\nissued by Headquarters during the battle of Ypres. Good work was done in\r\ndirecting the fire of the artillery, and the few wireless machines were\r\nmuch in demand. A telegram sent on the 28th of October from Sir Horace\r\nSmith-Dorrien to the Royal Flying Corps headquarters runs: 'Can you send\r\nus a second machine, with wireless installation, for use to-morrow? The\r\naeroplane now working without wireless with Fifth Division has more to\r\ndo than it can accomplish owing to observation being required for French\r\nartillery as well as our own.' But the wireless machine was required by\r\nthe First Corps, at the northern end of the line, and a machine without\r\nwireless was sent instead.\r\n\r\nThe deadly and effective method of directing artillery fire on hostile\r\nbatteries by means of wireless telegraphy played a great part in winning\r\nthe war, but for the first battle of Ypres the wireless machines were\r\nnot ready in quantity. The penalty which had to be paid for this\r\nunreadiness was heavy. Precious shells, which were all too few, had to\r\nbe expended for ranging purposes. On the 4th of November Lord Kitchener\r\nwired to Sir John French: 'I have been talking to David Henderson about\r\ngiving more observation to artillery by aeroplanes. As this saves the\r\nranging ammunition, which is worth anything to us, please insist upon\r\nit.' Failing wireless, other methods of ranging had to be employed.\r\nThese methods had been set forth in an official paper issued on the 28th\r\nof October. The aeroplane flies at any convenient height and when it is\r\nexactly above the target it fires a Very light. The battery\r\nrange-finders, who have been following its course, then take its range\r\nand another observer with the battery takes its angle of elevation.\r\nThese two observations are sufficient to determine the horizontal\r\ndistance between the battery and the target. It was sometimes found\r\ndifficult to take the range of an aeroplane, at a given moment, with an\r\nordinary range-finder, and an alternative method of ranging is\r\nsuggested. By this method the aeroplane flies at a prearranged height,\r\nand, as before, fires a light exactly over the target. But this method\r\nalso is liable to error, for an aeroplane determines its height by the\r\nuse of a barometer, and barometers are only approximately accurate for\r\nthis purpose. So it was suggested that the two methods should be\r\ncombined: the aeroplane should endeavour to fly at a fixed height, and\r\nthe range-finders should, if possible, also make their calculations.\r\nThese methods cannot attain to the accuracy of wireless, but they were\r\nfound in practice to give fairly good results. They were not quickly or\r\ngenerally adopted; many battery commanders continued to prefer the\r\nreports of their trained ground observers to the indications given from\r\nthe air. When wireless machines were increased in number, artillery\r\nobservation from the air came into its own. In a report dated the 5th of\r\nFebruary 1915, Brigadier-General Stokes, commander of the 27th\r\nDivisional Artillery, lays stress on the enormous advantages of\r\nwireless. He says that the 116th Heavy Battery of the Royal Garrison\r\nArtillery, which had at its disposal an aeroplane equipped with a lamp,\r\nhad succeeded in registering only three targets in fifteen days, whereas\r\nthe 130th Howitzer Battery, which had a share in the services of a\r\nwireless aeroplane, had registered eight targets in seven days. The\r\ndisadvantages of the older and cruder method are many; a thin mist which\r\ndoes not prevent the aeroplane from observing the target is enough to\r\nprevent signalling to the battery; the lamp is difficult to use on a\r\nrough day, and difficult to read against the sun; the aeroplane has to\r\nbe kept under continual observation by the battery. To get better value\r\nout of our artillery, the general concludes, the wireless service must\r\nbe largely increased.\r\n\r\nReconnaissance from the air was much impeded, during the second half of\r\nOctober, by low clouds and bad weather, but enough was observed to give\r\nsome forecast of the tremendous attack that was impending. The Germans\r\noutnumbered the British three or four times, and threw their whole\r\nweight, now against one part, and now against another, of the thin line\r\nof infantry fighting in mud and water. Those who would judge the battle\r\nwill find no escape from the dilemma; either the British defence,\r\nmaintained for thirty-four days, from the 19th of October to the 21st of\r\nNovember, against an army which esteemed itself the best army in the\r\nworld, must be given a high and honourable place among the great\r\nmilitary achievements of history, or the German army was disgraced by\r\nits defeat. But the German army was a good army, and was not disgraced.\r\nThe Germans themselves respected their enemy, on the ground and in the\r\nair. On the 21st of November, at the close of the battle of Ypres, two\r\nGerman second lieutenants of the air corps, called Fribenius and Hahn,\r\nwere taken prisoner near Neuve-Chapelle, and were examined. They said\r\nthat the performances of British aeroplanes had caused instructions to\r\nbe issued that a British aeroplane was to be attacked whenever\r\nencountered. British aeroplanes, they said, were easily distinguishable\r\nfrom others, for they always showed fight at once. What prisoners say\r\nunder examination is not evidence, but this early tribute to the\r\nfighting quality of the Royal Flying Corps is repeated in many later\r\ntestimonies.\r\n\r\nThe crisis of the battle of Ypres came on the 31st of October, when the\r\nline of the First Division was broken and the left flank of the Seventh\r\nDivision exposed, at Gheluvelt, some six miles east of Ypres. The\r\ncounter-attack by the First Guards Brigade and the famous bayonet charge\r\nof the Second Worcestershire Regiment retook Gheluvelt, and\r\nre-established the line. The last act of the long agony came on the 11th\r\nof November, when a great attack was delivered all along the line. The\r\nplace of honour on the Ypres-Menin road was given to two brigades of the\r\nPrussian Guard Corps, who had been brought up from Arras for the\r\npurpose. The First Division of the British army met this attack at its\r\nheaviest point of impact, and by the close of the day the Prussians had\r\ngained five hundred yards of ground at the cost of enormous losses. The\r\nstory of the battle belongs to military history; the loss and profit\r\naccount can be summarized in two facts. The First Brigade, which met the\r\nPrussian spearhead, was taken back into reserve on the following day. It\r\nhad gone into the battle four thousand five hundred strong; on the 12th\r\nof November there remained, of the First Scots Guards, one officer and\r\nsixty-nine men; of the Black Watch, one officer and a hundred and nine\r\nmen; of the Cameron Highlanders, three officers and a hundred and forty\r\nmen; of the First Coldstream Guards, no officers and a hundred and fifty\r\nmen. This is not a list of the surrendered remnant of an army: it is a\r\nlist of some of the victors of Ypres. The other fact is no less\r\nsignificant; after a week of fighting the German attack fainted and\r\ndied, and when the next great assault upon the Ypres salient was\r\ndelivered, in April 1915, it was led not by the Prussian Guard but by\r\nclouds of poison-gas.\r\n\r\nNo extraordinary or signal services were rendered by the Flying Corps\r\nduring the crises of the battle. The weather was bad, and on some days\r\nflying was impossible. Yet by every flight knowledge was increased. When\r\nthe British troops arrived in Flanders and were sent at once into the\r\nbattle, the country in front of them was unknown. The dispositions of\r\nthe enemy forces were not even guessed at. Then by the aid of the Flying\r\nCorps the enemy's batteries were mapped out, his trench lines observed\r\nand noted, his railheads and his roads watched for signs of movement.\r\nThe reports received just before the battle do not, it is true, indicate\r\nthe whole volume of movement that was coming towards the Ypres area. The\r\nnewly raised reserve corps which formed part of the German Fourth Army,\r\nthe transport of which to the western front began on the 10th of\r\nOctober, were not definitely seen from the air until just before the\r\nbattle. But observers' reports did indicate that many troops were\r\nmoving on the Ypres front, and once battle was joined enemy movements\r\nwere fully reported on.\r\n\r\nWhen at the end of October the Belgian army mortgaged great tracts of\r\ntheir ground for many years by opening the canal sluices and letting in\r\nthe sea, the Germans were enabled to divert the Third Reserve Corps\r\nsouthwards. The movements of troops from this area were observed by the\r\nRoyal Flying Corps, and General Headquarters on the 1st of November\r\nissued this summary: 'The coast road from Ostend to Nieuport was\r\nreported clear this morning, and there are indications generally of a\r\ntransference of troops from the north of Dixmude southwards.' Again,\r\nwhen the attack on Ypres had failed and died away, the Germans\r\ntransferred many troops from the western to the eastern front; these\r\nmovements also were seen by the Royal Flying Corps, who reported on the\r\n20th of November an abnormal amount of rolling stock at various stations\r\nbehind the German front. 'The rolling stock formerly parked on the\r\nOstend-Thourout and Ostend-Roulers lines has evidently been broken up',\r\nsays General Headquarters Intelligence Summary for the 20th of November,\r\n'and distributed to a number of stations along the Lys and in the area\r\nimmediately north of it, which would be suitable points of entrainment\r\nfor the forces in that district.... This redistribution of the rolling\r\nstock, together with the apparent reduction in motor transport, would\r\nseem to point to some important movement away from this immediate\r\ntheatre being in contemplation.' Air reports for the following day\r\nproved that much movement eastwards had already taken place.\r\n\r\nThroughout the battle tactical reconnaissances had been maintained to a\r\ndepth of from fifteen to twenty miles behind the German lines. There\r\nwere some few fights in the air, and a little bombing, but observation\r\nwas still the principal duty of the Royal Flying Corps. They were\r\ngreatly privileged; at a time when our people at home knew nothing of\r\nwhat the army was doing, they, and they alone, witnessed the battle of\r\nYpres.\r\n\r\nThey would gladly have done more. Many of them had been infantry\r\nofficers, and were eager to lend a hand to the infantry in that heroic\r\nstruggle, but they lacked the means. Not until the summer of 1916 were\r\nthey able, by organized attacks from the air, to help to determine the\r\nfortunes of a battle.\r\n\r\nWith the close of the battle there came a lull in the fighting. This\r\nlull continued throughout the dark and damp of the first winter, and the\r\ninterest of the war in the air shifts to the preparations which were\r\nbeing pressed forward at home for renewing the war during 1915 on a\r\nlarger scale and with better material.\r\n\r\nOne incident which occurred just after the battle of Ypres shall here be\r\nnarrated; it serves to illustrate how the air work of the Germans may\r\nsometimes have been impeded by a certain defect of sympathy in the\r\nGerman officer class. German two-seater machines were commonly piloted\r\nby non-commissioned officers, who took their orders from the officer in\r\nthe observer's seat. On the 22nd of November Lieutenants L. A. Strange\r\nand F. G. Small, of No. 5 Squadron, were returning from a\r\nreconnaissance, flying at a height of about seven thousand feet. Their\r\nmachine, an Avro, with an 80 horse-power Gnome engine, carried a Lewis\r\ngun, which had been mounted by them, against orders, on rope tackle of\r\ntheir own devising, just above the observer's seat. In the air they met\r\na new German Albatross with a 100 horse-power Mercedes engine. They\r\nshowed fight at once. Diving from a height of five hundred feet above\r\nthe German machine, and at right angles to its line of flight, they\r\nturned underneath it and flew along with it, a little in front and less\r\nthan a hundred feet below. From this position, which they maintained\r\nwhile both machines made two complete turns in the air, they were able\r\nto empty two drums of ammunition into the German machine. After the\r\nsecond drum the German pilot lost his nerve, and the machine\r\nside-slipped away and down, landing behind our lines, close to\r\nNeuve-Eglise. There were twenty bullet-holes in the German machine, but\r\nthe pilot and observer were both uninjured. The British officers landed\r\nclose by, to claim their prisoners. The German observer, a commissioned\r\nofficer, took little notice of them; as soon as his machine landed he\r\njumped out of it, and dragging the partner of his dangers and triumphs\r\nout of the pilot's seat, knocked him down, and began to kick him heavily\r\nabout the body. If ever a collection of incidents shall be made, under\r\nthe title 'How the War was Lost and Won', to illustrate the causes of\r\nthings, this little drama will deserve a place in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL NAVAL AIR SERVICE IN 1914\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out the Naval Wing of the Royal Flying Corps had\r\nalready been separated from the Military Wing, and had become the Royal\r\nNaval Air Service. Captain Murray Sueter was Director of the Air\r\nDepartment, and Captain G. M. Paine was Commandant of the Central Flying\r\nSchool. Six officers, all pioneers of the air, held the rank of wing\r\ncommander, and nineteen held the rank of squadron commander. There were\r\ntwelve flight commanders, and, with the addition of some few who joined\r\non the 5th and 6th of August, there were ninety-one flight lieutenants,\r\nflight sub-lieutenants, and warrant officers. The number of petty\r\nofficers and men was approximately seven hundred. Some of the officers\r\nand men had been appointed for special duties in connexion with gunnery,\r\ntorpedo work, navigation, wireless telegraphy, and engineering. The\r\nduties which fell to the Royal Naval Air Service were naturally more\r\nvarious and more complicated than those which fell to the Royal Flying\r\nCorps. The Naval Air Service had to fly seaplanes and airships, as well\r\nas aeroplanes. They had made more progress than the Military Wing in\r\nfitting wireless telegraphy and in arming aircraft. They had in their\r\npossession, when war broke out, thirty-nine aeroplanes and fifty-two\r\nseaplanes, of which about half were ready for immediate use. They had\r\nalso seven airships, of which one, the little Willows airship, may be\r\nleft out of the reckoning, but of the others, the _Parseval_,\r\n_Astra-Torres_, and _Beta_ did good work in the war. Some of the\r\naeroplanes and most of the seaplanes were fitted with more powerful\r\nengines than any that were used by the Royal Flying Corps. Engines of\r\ntwo hundred horse-power were being installed in Short, Wight, and\r\nSopwith seaplanes, with a view not chiefly to speed but to the carrying\r\nof torpedoes. These machines were not successful at first, but\r\nexperiment was active. Two aeroplanes and one airship had been fitted\r\nwith machine-guns; petrol incendiary bombs had been tried with success;\r\nand gear for the release of bombs was being gradually improved. More\r\nimportant still, wireless telegraphy plants had been set up at the\r\nvarious seaplane stations on the coast, and sixteen seaplanes, operating\r\nin connexion with these stations, had been fitted with transmitting\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nThese preparations, when they are looked back on across the years of\r\nwar, may seem tentative and small, but the idea which dominated them is\r\nclear enough. Whether war would come soon was doubtful; what was certain\r\nwas that war, if it did come, would come from the nation which for many\r\nlong years had boasted of war, preached war, and intended war. The main\r\nconcern of the Naval Air Service, in co-operation with the navy, was the\r\ndefence of the East Coast from attack, whether by sea or by air, and the\r\nsafeguarding of the Channel for the passage of an expeditionary force to\r\nthe coast of Belgium or France. Other uses for a naval air force were a\r\nmatter of time and experiment. There was at first no general scheme,\r\nprepared in detail, and ready to be put into action, for the offensive\r\nemployment of naval aircraft, so that the work of the service tended to\r\nrelapse into defence. Very little had been done to provide for the\r\nco-operation of aircraft with the fleet at sea. The _Mayfly_ mishap had\r\nleft us unsupplied with airships of the necessary power and range for\r\nnaval reconnaissance, nor were the means at hand to enable seaplanes to\r\ndo scouting work for the fleet. In December 1912 a design for a\r\nspecially constructed seaplane-carrying ship had been submitted by the\r\nAir Department after consultation with Messrs. Beardmore of Dalmuir, but\r\nwhen the war came no such ship was in existence. The light cruiser\r\nH.M.S. _Hermes_ had been adapted for seaplane carrying and had operated\r\nwith the fleet during the naval manoeuvres of July 1913, but this was no\r\nmore than a makeshift. The _Hermes_ was refitted and re-commissioned in\r\nOctober 1914 to carry three seaplanes, and at the end of that month was\r\nsunk by a torpedo from an enemy submarine on her passage from Dunkirk to\r\nDover.\r\n\r\nWar is a wonderful stimulant; and many things were done at high\r\npressure, in the early days of August, to increase the resources, in men\r\nand material, of the Naval Air Service. The reserve was called up; in\r\naddition a certain number of officers were entered direct from civilian\r\nlife, and were put to school, at Upavon or Eastchurch, to learn their\r\nnew duties. Thousands of young men were eager to enter the service as\r\npilots, but the training accommodation was wholly inadequate. The\r\nBristol School at Brooklands, the Grahame-White School at Hendon, and\r\nthe Eastbourne Aviation School were pressed into the service; in\r\naddition to these the naval air station at Calshot undertook to make\r\nseaplane pilots of some of those who had taken their flying certificates\r\nelsewhere. As was to be expected, training under these conditions proved\r\ndifficult. All efficient machines were wanted for the war, so that\r\nmachines which had been condemned for use on active service were\r\nsometimes employed in training new pilots.\r\n\r\nIf all those who deserve credit and praise for their part in the war in\r\nthe air were to be mentioned, their names on the Roll of Honour would be\r\nthick as the motes that people the sunbeam. Most of them must be\r\ncontent, and are content, to know that they did their work and served\r\ntheir country. But here and there occurs a name which must not be passed\r\nwithout comment. On the 5th of August 1914 Mr. F. K. McClean, by whose\r\nhelp the first naval air pilots had been trained, joined the Royal Naval\r\nAir Service as a flight lieutenant. At the same time he offered to the\r\nservice his three motor-cars, his motor-boat at Teddington, his yacht\r\n_Zenaida_, with two machines, and his private house at Eastchurch, which\r\nwas converted into a hospital. A nation which commands the allegiance of\r\nsuch citizens need never fear defeat.\r\n\r\nThe earliest measure of defence undertaken by the Naval Air Service was\r\nthe institution of a coastal patrol for the whole of the East Coast,\r\nfrom Kinnaird's Head, in Aberdeenshire, to Dungeness, between Dover and\r\nHastings. This was ordered by the Admiralty on the 8th of August. The\r\nRoyal Flying Corps, or rather, such incomplete squadrons of the Royal\r\nFlying Corps as were not yet ordered abroad, undertook the northern and\r\nsouthern extremes of this patrol, that is to say, the northern section\r\nbetween the Moray Firth and the Firth of Forth, from Kinnaird's Head to\r\nFife Ness, and the southern section between the Thames and the coast of\r\nSussex, from the North Foreland to Dungeness. The most vulnerable part\r\nof the East Coast, from the Forth to the Thames, or from North Berwick\r\nto Clacton, was to be patrolled by the Naval Air Service. But these\r\narrangements were soon altered. Not many days after the outbreak of war\r\nthe Germans established themselves in Belgium, and it was believed that\r\nthey would use Belgium as a base for formidable attacks by aircraft on\r\nthe Thames estuary and London. The forces of the Naval Air Service were\r\ntherefore concentrated between the Humber and the Thames, from Immingham\r\nto Clacton. The Wash was thought to be the most likely landfall for a\r\nGerman airship raiding London. Regular patrols of the coast were carried\r\nout in the early days of the war, to report the movements of all enemy\r\nships and aircraft and to detect enemy submarines. But there was not\r\nmuch to report, and it was weary work waiting for the enemy to begin.\r\n\r\nThe British Expeditionary Force was ready for service abroad, and it\r\nfell to the Naval Air Service to watch over its passage across the\r\nChannel. A regular patrol between Westgate, close to the North Foreland,\r\nand Ostend was maintained by seaplanes, following one another at\r\nintervals of two hours. On the 13th of August a temporary seaplane base\r\nwas established at Ostend under the command of Flight Lieutenant E. T.\r\nR. Chambers, but on the 22nd of August, when the expeditionary force was\r\nsafely landed and the occupation of Ostend by the Germans seemed\r\nimminent, the base was withdrawn, and the men and stores were taken back\r\nto England. An airship patrol of the Channel undertaken by airships Nos.\r\n3 and 4 (that is to say, by the _Astra-Torres_ and _Parseval_) began on\r\nthe 10th of August, and was continued throughout the month. The average\r\ntime of flight of a seaplane on patrol was about three hours, of an\r\nairship about twelve hours, so that the airship, which could slacken its\r\nspeed and hover, had the advantage in observation. The chart printed on\r\np. 363 illustrates the patrols carried out by the two airships on the\r\n13th of August 1914. Here are copies of their logs for the day:\r\n\r\n  '_Log of No. 3 Airship, 13th August 1914._\r\n\r\n  7.10 a.m. Rose.\r\n  7.37      Passed Sittingbourne.\r\n  7.45      Passed Teynham Station.\r\n  7.50      Passed Faversham.\r\n  8.20      Passed Canterbury.\r\n  9.0       Passed Coastguard Station.\r\n  9.49      Sighted No. 4 Airship.\r\n  10.41     Sighted seaplane on starboard quarter.\r\n  5.50 p.m. Altered course for Coastguard Station.\r\n  6.25      Coastguard Station.\r\n  6.54      Faversham.\r\n  7.4       Sittingbourne.\r\n  7.34      Landed.\r\n\r\n\r\n'_Log of No. 4 Airship, 13th August 1914._\r\n\r\n  7.40 a.m.  Left Kingsnorth.\r\n  9.28       Passed Coastguard Station, shaped course\r\n             for Calais.\r\n  10.35      Shaped course for Dover.\r\n  11.25      Shaped course for Calais.\r\n  11.35[5]     Broke one blade of port propeller, rendering\r\n             it necessary to change two for new\r\n             blades.\r\n  12.55 p.m. Proceeded to Calais.\r\n  1.40       Shaped course for Dover.\r\n  2.12       Course as requisite to arrive at Calais.\r\n  2.52         \"    \"     \"      \"    \"    \"  Dover.\r\n  3.20         \"    \"     \"      \"    \"    \"  Calais.\r\n  4.00         \"    \"     \"      \"    \"    \"  Dover.\r\n  4.45         \"    \"     \"      \"    \"    \"  Calais.\r\n  5.45         \"    \"     \"      \"    \"    \"  Deal.\r\n  7.30       Arrived at Kingsnorth.\r\n  7.53       Landed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: 'Off Dover at 11.35 a.m. one blade of the port\r\n    propeller burst and flew off, narrowly missing damaging the rigging\r\n    near the envelope. We were able to fit two new blades while under\r\n    way and continue the patrol. This took one hour and twenty\r\n    minutes.']\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Airship Patrol. 13th August, 1914.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the _Parseval_, which could not fly for a whole day\r\nwithout landing for the replenishment of fuel, plied continually\r\nbetween Dover and Calais, while the _Astra-Torres_, which was the\r\nstronger ship, laid her course far to the east and north-east to search\r\nthe Channel for the approach of hostile craft.\r\n\r\nOnce the expeditionary force was safely across the Channel, these\r\nroutine patrols were discontinued, though both airships and seaplanes\r\ncontinued to make special scouting flights over the North Sea and\r\nChannel. The main work of the Royal Naval Air Service continued to be\r\ncoastguard work. At dawn and at sunset patrols were carried out every\r\npossible day, scouting the line of the coast. The group which had its\r\ncentre at the Isle of Grain was entrusted with the defence of the Thames\r\nestuary. They had to report the approach of hostile ships and aircraft,\r\nto help our submarines in attack, and to warn friendly craft. They had\r\ntwo sub-stations, at Clacton and Westgate, facing each other across the\r\nestuary. The monotony of the life was relieved at times by alarms. In\r\nSeptember a seaplane on patrol from Felixstowe sighted a Zeppelin. The\r\nnews was received with enthusiasm, which was damped a little when it was\r\nlearned that the pilot was some way out to sea, and that his estimate of\r\nhis distance from the Zeppelin was sixty miles. On the 17th of November\r\nthe Admiralty suspected an impending raid by German warships, and\r\nordered that all available aeroplanes and seaplanes should be in the air\r\nfor the daylight patrol of Thursday, the 19th of November. But even war,\r\nas the philosopher remarked, has its seamy side, and the enemy did not\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nThis patrol work was tedious and, when the winter came, even dangerous;\r\na few pilots were lost and some spent hours adrift on wrecked seaplanes.\r\nHere is the report of a December experience of Squadron Commander J. W.\r\nSeddon, over the North Sea:\r\n\r\n'I have the honour to report as follows on the circumstances of my\r\npatrol flight with Leading Mechanic R. L. Hartley in Seaplane No. 829\r\nfrom Grain on Thursday, 17th inst., which ended with the salvage of this\r\nseaplane by the Norwegian Steamship _Orn_, who took us with the seaplane\r\nto Holland; and also on the circumstances of our detention at the Hook\r\nof Holland and subsequent release, and of the detention of the seaplane\r\nat Rotterdam.\r\n\r\n  '1. _Diary of Events._\r\n\r\n  8.10 a.m.      Left Grain. Wind Wly, moderate.\r\n\r\n  9.0 a.m.       Passed over Galloper, continued eastwards\r\n                 to investigate steamer proceeding eastwards\r\n                 at high speed.\r\n\r\n  9.10 a.m.      Steamer proved to be s.s. _Fulmar_ of Liverpool.\r\n                 Turned back for Galloper. Wind\r\n                 strong Wly.\r\n\r\n  9.35 a.m.      Motor failed suddenly and completely.\r\n                 Landed, nothing in sight. Sea moderately\r\n                 bad. Failure due to breakage of\r\n                 ignition ring, and though several attempts\r\n                 were made and engine started on\r\n                 each occasion, a lasting repair could not\r\n                 be made. As I was not carrying an\r\n                 anchor seaplane commenced to drift at\r\n                 about 2 knots through the water E. by\r\n                 N. (compass).\r\n\r\n'I was feeling unwell when I left Grain and consequently was continually\r\nill; Leading Mechanic Hartley also was seasick at first.\r\n\r\n'The seaplane commenced to settle on the port main float and about 10.30\r\nthe port wing float carried away. Leading Mechanic Hartley moved out of\r\nhis seat on to the starboard plane.\r\n\r\n'The starboard wing float carried away about 11.15 a.m. and the trailing\r\nedge of the port lower plane was continually disintegrating.\r\n\r\n'About noon, or perhaps 11.30 a.m., the Flushing steamer passed from E.\r\nto W., but 7 or 8 miles to the Northward, and did not see our signals.\r\n\r\n'From then onwards Hartley was continually moving slightly outwards on\r\nthe plane to counteract the heel to port, and occasional heavy seas\r\noccurring every five or ten minutes accumulated small damages.\r\n\r\n'I therefore endeavoured to empty the main tank by overflowing through\r\nthe gravity tank, but the petrol coming back into my face made me more\r\nill, and after half an hour I could not continue.\r\n\r\n'At 2.45 p.m., when I was expecting that a T.B.D. might appear to search\r\nfor us, we sighted a small steamer to the N. Westward and making more or\r\nless towards us (some 6 miles distant). Waiting till she was abeam and\r\nonly some 2 to 3 miles distant I fired my pistol and also waved. These\r\nsignals did not appear to be observed at first, but finally she turned\r\ntowards us about 3.15 p.m. and about 3.30 asked us if we wished to be\r\ntaken off. This steamer proved to be the s.s. _Orn_ (Captain Rewne). He\r\nmanoeuvred and lowered a boat and took us aboard about 4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n'I asked the Captain if he could consider salving the seaplane, being\r\nworth as she was about L2,000, while the engine alone was worth L600 or\r\nL700.\r\n\r\n'He promised to try and I went away in the boat again to the seaplane.\r\n\r\n'I was not able to board the seaplane myself (going overboard while\r\nassisting one of the crew to do so), but this man got on board the\r\nseaplane successfully and made the necessary lines fast.\r\n\r\n'After some difficulty and damage to the seaplane through insufficient\r\nreach of the derrick, she was got on board and the wings folded by 6.0\r\np.m.; the _Orn_ actually proceeding on her course shortly before this.\r\nNo other vessels were sighted during these operations. We were picked\r\nup about 11 miles east from the Galloper Lightship.\r\n\r\n'The Captain of the _Orn_ said he could not put back to England on\r\naccount of there being no lights, but otherwise would have done so.\r\n\r\n'The Captain of the _Orn_ did everything possible for us, supplying us\r\nwith hot coffee, food, and wine, and myself with dry clothes.\r\n\r\n'We arrived in Dutch waters about 3.10 a.m. and anchored off the\r\n\"Hook\".'\r\n\r\nAfter attending to the seaplane and taking all possible steps to secure\r\nits release by the Dutch Government, Squadron Commander Seddon was\r\nsuccessful in obtaining the release of himself and his companion; on the\r\n20th of December they sailed from Rotterdam for Harwich.\r\n\r\nThe seaplane patrols had not sufficient range to get into touch with the\r\nenemy off his own coasts, as the flying boat patrols almost always did\r\nin the later years of the war. Nevertheless, the first six months of\r\ncoastguard work were of high value. They knit the service together, and\r\nproduced a large body of skilled and practised pilots who prepared\r\nthemselves or instructed others for later achievement.\r\n\r\nAn additional station for seaplane and aeroplane work was established at\r\nScapa Flow to carry out patrols over the fleet. The patrols commenced on\r\nthe 24th of August 1914 and continued daily in all weathers until the\r\n21st of November, when the machines and hangars were completely wrecked\r\nin a gale. On the 27th of August 'Seaplanes Nos. 97 and 156 led the\r\nBattle Fleet to sea'. These were both Henri Farman seaplanes. There were\r\nalso two Short seaplanes and a Sopwith Bat boat. A few more were added\r\nin the course of the following weeks, and so zealous and efficient were\r\nthe mechanics that, with all the wear and tear of the daily patrol, not\r\nmore than two machines at the most were ever out of action at one time\r\nduring the first six weeks. Further bases were established during the\r\nautumn of 1914 at Newcastle-on-Tyne and Dover, but the lack of\r\nserviceable machines curtailed the activities of these stations.\r\n\r\nThe real dramatic centre of England's effort in the air was to be found,\r\nduring these months, not at the coastal stations, but in the training\r\nschools and workshops. The progress there made, at first invisible, was\r\nso rapid that Captain Sueter was able to say in July 1915 that every\r\nmachine possessed by the Royal Naval Air Service at the outbreak of the\r\nwar 'is now regarded as fit only for a museum'.\r\n\r\nThe problem of providing seaplanes with a floating base so that they\r\nmight operate with the fleet at sea became urgent at once. On the 11th\r\nof August the Admiralty, realizing the great utility of aerial scouting\r\nwith the fleet, took over three cross-Channel steamers from the\r\nSouth-Eastern and Chatham Railway Company--the _Empress_, the\r\n_Engadine_, and the _Riviera_. The _Empress_ was fitted out to carry\r\nmachines and stores for the Naval Air Service. The _Engadine_ and the\r\n_Riviera_ were structurally altered at Chatham Dockyard, so that they\r\nmight serve as seaplane-carriers. Later on, in October 1914, the\r\n_Empress_ was also converted into a seaplane-carrier, and her work as\r\ntransport and messenger vessel was taken over by the _Princess\r\nVictoria_.\r\n\r\nThe whole business of seaplanes was still in the experimental stage, and\r\nduring the first twelve months of the war there were many\r\ndisappointments. It was found that the seaplanes, when they were loaded\r\nwith bombs, could not get off a sea that would hardly distress a picket\r\nboat. Proposals for an aerial raid on Wilhelmshaven and the Kiel canal\r\nwere put forward by the Admiralty on the 13th of August, but the\r\nmachinery was too imperfect, and the raid did not come off. But on\r\nChristmas Day, 1914, when the weather was propitious, a successful raid\r\nwas carried out, as shall be seen, against Cuxhaven. In the meantime\r\nmuch experimental work was done at high pressure, and a heavy\r\nresponsibility fell on the technical staff of the Naval Air Service, who\r\nhad to place definite orders, a year ahead, for engines to be developed\r\nand manufactured upon a large scale. In 1915 this policy produced the\r\n225 horse-power Wight tractor, which could fly for seven hours at a\r\nspeed of seventy knots, carrying a fair weight of bombs, and the 225\r\nhorse-power Short tractor, which could carry five hundredweight of\r\nexplosives over a distance of three hundred miles. Both these machines\r\ncould face broken water better than the earlier types, though it was not\r\nuntil the flying boat was perfected that the difficulties presented by a\r\nmoderate sea were at last overcome.\r\n\r\nIt was an acute disappointment to the Naval Air Service that the enemy\r\nfleet at Wilhelmshaven and the enemy dockyards at Kiel should be left so\r\nlong unmolested. The tendency to find some one to blame for lost\r\nopportunities is always strong in England. We are a strenuous and moral\r\npeople, and we ask for a very formidable blend of virtues in our\r\nleaders. We are proud of the bull-dog breed and the traditions of our\r\nnavy, but we demand from the bull-dog all the subtlety of the fox. We\r\ncame through the war with credit not chiefly by intelligence but by\r\ncharacter. Perhaps the two are never perfectly combined in one man. We\r\nknow what it is to entrust our good name and our safety to men of\r\nstalwart and upright character, whose intelligence may in some points be\r\nopen to criticism. Fortunately, we do not so well know what it is to\r\ntrust our ultimate welfare to men of quick intelligence whose character\r\nis not above suspicion. The Lords of the Admiralty, like the rest of\r\nthat great service, are good fighting sailors and good patriots.\r\n\r\nWhat are called the principles of war, though they can be simply stated,\r\nare not easy to learn, and can never be learned from books alone. They\r\nare the principles of human nature; and who ever learned from books how\r\nto deal successfully with his fellows? War, which drives human nature to\r\nits last resources, is a great engine of education, teaching no lessons\r\nwhich it does not illustrate, and enforcing all its lessons by bitter\r\npenalties. One of the notorious principles of war, familiar to all who\r\nhave read books about war, is that a merely defensive attitude is a\r\nlosing attitude. This truth is as true of games and boxing, or of\r\ntraffic and bargaining, as it is of war. Every successful huckster is\r\nthoroughly versed in the doctrine of the initiative, which he knows by\r\ninstinct and experience, not by the reading of learned treatises. A man\r\nwho knows what he wants and means to get it is at a great advantage in\r\ntraffic with another man who is thinking only of self-defence. Every\r\nsuccessful boxer is an expert in military science; he tries either to\r\nweaken his adversary by repeated assaults on the vital organs, or to\r\nknock him out by a stunning blow. He does not call these operations by\r\nthe learned names of strategy and tactics, but he knows all about them.\r\nThe most that a book can do, for trader or boxer or soldier, is to\r\nquicken perception and prepare the mind for the teaching of experience.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the war from beginning to end taught the old lesson of\r\nthe supreme value of the offensive. The lesson was quickly learned and\r\nput to the proof by our forces on the western front. The Royal Naval Air\r\nService, from the first, sought every opportunity for offensive action.\r\nRaids over enemy centres, for the reasons which have been given, were\r\nimpossible to carry out except in the best of weather. Offensive action\r\nin collaboration with ships of war was impeded by the imperfect\r\nstructure of the seaplanes and the imperfect arrangements for conveying\r\nthem to the scene of action. Meantime the public, impressed by the\r\ndangers to be feared from the Zeppelin, called chiefly for defence. It\r\nhas never been easy to instruct even the members of the other services\r\nconcerning the right use of aircraft in war. When once they were\r\nreconciled to our aeroplanes they liked to see them in the air above\r\nthem, which is the place of all places where our aeroplanes are least\r\nuseful. It is greatly to the credit of those officers who commanded the\r\nRoyal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service that they divined the\r\nright doctrine, and practised it, and established it in use, thereby\r\nsecuring for the air force the liberty to use its power to the best\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe best and most highly trained of the naval air units was the first to\r\nbe sent abroad. This was the Eastchurch squadron, under Wing Commander\r\nSamson. Just after the outbreak of war it had been sent to Skegness, to\r\ncarry out patrol duties. On the 25th of August its commander was\r\nsummoned to London by the Director of the Air Department, and was\r\nordered to take his squadron on the following morning to Ostend, which\r\nhad been chosen to serve as an advanced base for reconnaissance. They\r\nwere to co-operate with a force of marines. Air Commodore Samson, in the\r\nreminiscences which he has kindly contributed for the purpose of this\r\nhistory, speaks with enthusiasm of the men and officers under his\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\n'Never once', he says, 'were we let down by our men, and both in France\r\nand the Dardanelles they worked like slaves without a single complaint.\r\nIt is an absolute fact that during these periods I never had to deal\r\nwith a single disciplinary offence. They were the very pick of the Royal\r\nNaval Air Service.'\r\n\r\nThe pilots, after receiving their orders, were kept waiting for a day at\r\nEastchurch, to give time for the landing of the Marine Brigade. 'This\r\ndepressed everybody,' says Air Commodore Samson, 'as we were all\r\nsuffering from the fear of the war being over before we could get a\r\nchance to take part in it.' The fear proved groundless.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of August there flew over:\r\n\r\n  Wing Commander C. R. Samson.\r\n  Flight Lieutenant S. V. Sippe.\r\n  Flight Lieutenant E. Osmond.\r\n  Squadron Commander R. B. Davies.\r\n  Flight Lieutenant C. F. Beevor.\r\n  Squadron Commander E. F. Briggs.\r\n  Flight Lieutenant I. H. W. S. Dalrymple-Clarke.\r\n  Squadron Commander I. T. Courtney.\r\n  Flight Lieutenant H. A. Littleton.\r\n  Flight Lieutenant Lord Edward Grosvenor.\r\n\r\nAn airship (No. 3) was flown across by Wing Commander N. F. Usborne,\r\nwith him Flight Lieutenant W. C. Hicks and Flight Lieutenant E. H.\r\nSparling. Squadron Commander R. H. Clark Hall, Captain Barnby of the\r\nRoyal Marines, and four junior officers of the Royal Naval Volunteer\r\nReserve were attached for special duties. The motor-cars, lorries, and\r\nstores were embarked at Sheerness on board H.M.S. _Empress_ and s.s.\r\n_Rawcliffe_. The machines that were flown over were a various\r\nassemblage--three B.E. biplanes, two Sopwith biplanes, two Bleriot\r\nmonoplanes, one Henri Farman biplane, one Bristol biplane, and a\r\nconverted Short seaplane fitted with a land undercarriage in place of\r\nthe floats. Warrant Officer J. G. Brownridge, R.N., was in charge of the\r\nrepair and upkeep of the aeroplanes. In these early days there were no\r\ndistinguishing marks on aeroplanes; it was arranged that every machine\r\nshould fly a Union Jack lashed to one of its struts, but this was not\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prepared in the Historical Section of the Committee of\r\nImperial Defence.\r\n\r\nCommander Samson's Operations in Belgium.]\r\n\r\nThe whole force arrived in safety, with only one or two minor mishaps.\r\nWing Commander Samson was fired at by rifles as he was coming down, and\r\nafter landing was stalked by a couple of British marines, who had come\r\nto Belgium to shoot Germans and were aching to get to work.\r\n\r\nThe force remained at Ostend for three days only. There was no artillery\r\nexcept the guns of the ships lying off the port, and the Marine Brigade\r\nhad only about half a dozen machine-guns. The defence of Ostend against\r\na German attack in force would have been more than difficult. The\r\naeroplanes carried out reconnaissance flights daily over the area\r\nbetween Bruges, Ghent, and Ypres, and, on the suggestion of General\r\nAston, who commanded the Marine Brigade, Wing Commander Samson made a\r\nmotor-car reconnaissance as far as Thourout and Bruges, in two cars, one\r\nof them fitted with a Maxim gun. 'At Bruges', says Air Commodore Samson,\r\n'we were received with great enthusiasm, the streets being crowded with\r\npeople. The popular delusion, which we did not contradict, was that we\r\nwere the advance party of a large British army. The Civil Guard hastily\r\ndonned their uniform on our arrival, and turned out briskly, with\r\nweapons and valour. They used, we found out later, to be quick-change\r\nartists, from uniform to plain clothes, and vice versa, according to the\r\ncircumstances. Having gained some information in the town, we returned\r\nto Ostend. The whole party enjoyed themselves immensely, although some\r\nof the more bloodthirsty members were disappointed at not getting a\r\nfight. This trip made us consider the question of motor-car operations,\r\nand ideas were discussed for armouring the cars.'\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of August orders came that the Marine Brigade and the\r\naeroplane squadron should return at once to England. It was a depressed\r\nparty that loaded up the stores and transport on board H.M.S. _Empress_\r\nand the attendant collier. The aeroplanes flew by way of Dunkirk, where\r\nthere was a slight haze and they landed. Lord Edward Grosvenor made a\r\nfaulty landing, and crashed his Bleriot beyond all hopes of repair. This\r\naccident, which would have been treated as insignificant if it had\r\noccurred on the way out, proved important enough to delay the aeroplanes\r\nfor three days at Dunkirk. During this time General Bidon, who commanded\r\nthe French troops at Dunkirk, and Mr. Sarel, the British vice-consul,\r\nmade urgent representations to the British Foreign Office, pleading that\r\nthe squadron should be permitted, for military and diplomatic reasons,\r\nto co-operate with the French. Meantime, two of the aeroplanes carried\r\nout a reconnaissance towards Lille and Douai. On the 1st of September a\r\ntelegram came from the Admiralty ordering that the squadron should\r\nremain at Dunkirk, to operate against Zeppelins and enemy aeroplanes,\r\nand to carry out reconnaissances as required by the French general. The\r\npolicy that was now adopted was subsequently explained at greater length\r\nin an Admiralty telegram to the French Ministry of Marine:\r\n\r\n'The Admiralty considers it extremely important to deny the use of\r\nterritory within a hundred miles of Dunkirk to German Zeppelins, and to\r\nattack by aeroplanes all airships found replenishing there. With your\r\npermission the Admiralty wish to take all necessary measures to maintain\r\naerial command of this region. The Admiralty proposes therefore to place\r\nthirty or forty naval aeroplanes at Dunkirk or other convenient coast\r\npoints. In order that these may have a good radius of action they must\r\nbe able to establish temporary bases forty to fifty miles inland. The\r\nAdmiralty desires to reinforce officer commanding aeroplanes with fifty\r\nto sixty armed motor-cars and two hundred to three hundred men. This\r\nsmall force will operate in conformity with the wishes of the French\r\nmilitary authorities, but we hope it may be accorded a free initiative.\r\nThe immunity of Portsmouth, Chatham, and London from dangerous aerial\r\nattack is clearly involved.'\r\n\r\nSo this little naval force began at once to operate from Dunkirk,\r\ncarrying out reconnaissances by aeroplane, and using motor-cars for\r\nraids on the flank of the German communications. It gave assistance to\r\nthe French and put heart into the much-tried civil population of\r\nBelgium. Most of the work at first was done with motor-cars, for the\r\naeroplanes were few in number.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of September Wing Commander Samson, having started out with\r\ntwo cars, one of them fitted with a Maxim gun, heard at Cassel by\r\ntelephone that six German officers in a motor-car had just passed\r\nthrough Bailleul on their way to Cassel. The steep hill down from Cassel\r\nto the plain beneath offered him an excellent point of vantage to lie in\r\nwait for them, but he was unwilling to take it, for a fight close to the\r\ntown would have given the Germans an excuse for pretending that they had\r\nbeen attacked by civilians, and for shooting some of the inhabitants. So\r\nhe went out to meet them, and engaged them at a range of five hundred\r\nyards on the Cassel-Bailleul road. Two of the Germans were wounded, and\r\ntheir car made off to Bailleul. Wing Commander Samson lay in wait for\r\nthem for almost two hours, in the hope that they would return reinforced\r\nto continue the engagement. During this time an old French captain of\r\ngendarmes, about sixty-five years of age, with a long-barrelled pistol,\r\narrived in a limousine, accompanied by his wife. He had raised a little\r\narmy of ten gendarmes, who came up soon after, armed with carbines.\r\nMadame and the limousine then retired from the battle-field, while the\r\ngallant captain disposed his army behind the hedge to await the return\r\nof the enemy. But the enemy did not return; a message from the Bailleul\r\npost office told how they had halted only three minutes in Bailleul, and\r\nhow they and all the other German military cars in Bailleul had gone\r\nback post-haste to Lille, leaving behind them a quantity of wine which\r\nthey had collected from the residents. 'We had a tremendous reception',\r\nsays Air Commodore Samson, 'from the inhabitants of Cassel, who had\r\nenjoyed a splendid view of our little engagement from their commanding\r\nposition on the hill-top. I was pleased that they had seen Germans\r\nrunning away, as it would remove from their minds that 1870 feeling\r\nwhich there is little doubt the Germans still produced in the minds of\r\ncivilian Frenchmen. This fight gave us a prestige in the villages\r\ngreater than its result called for. Probably the six German officers\r\nreported that they had run up against tremendous odds.'\r\n\r\nIn the course of the next few weeks there were many such adventures. On\r\nthe 5th of September, the eve of the battle of the Marne, General Bidon\r\nreported that the Germans, who had occupied Lille in force, were about\r\nto leave, and that he intended to send some infantry, supported by a\r\nsquadron of cavalry at Bailleul, to capture the transport wagons which\r\nwere likely to be left behind. He asked for some motor-cars to escort\r\nthe infantry back from Lille. Wing Commander Samson, having borrowed\r\nfrom the French two machine-guns (he had only one of his own) and four\r\nFrench artillerymen, started off early on the morning of the 6th of\r\nSeptember, with four motor-cars (three of them armed with machine-guns),\r\nsix officers, ten of his own men, and the four Frenchmen. An aeroplane,\r\nflown by Flight Lieutenant Dalrymple-Clarke, was detailed to escort\r\nthem, with instructions to fly well ahead and to come down low and fire\r\na Very light if any of the enemy were sighted. In the outskirts of Lille\r\nthe party learned that the Germans, two thousand infantry and eighty\r\ncavalry, had left Lille that morning, so they went on into the big\r\nsquare where the Prefecture stands. The square was packed with people.\r\nThe rest shall be told in Air Commodore Samson's own words:\r\n\r\n'We got through the crowd, and took the cars into the courtyard, lining\r\nthem up abreast facing the square. The gendarmes at my request kept the\r\nroadway in front of the building clear of the populace, so that we were\r\nafforded a clear exit in case we had a fight, although I did not much\r\nlook forward to one with this seething crowd of civilians in the way.\r\nPractically the whole of Lille appeared to be here; they were most\r\nenthusiastic, cheering, singing, and shouting out, _Vive l'Angleterre!_\r\nI did everything I could to impress the people with our discipline and\r\nmilitary behaviour, placing four of my men as sentries in a line behind\r\nthe railings, and one man standing by each machine-gun. Our sentries\r\nstood like Guardsmen, and even when beautiful French girls came on the\r\nscene, and sponged their faces and brushed the dust off their clothes,\r\nthey stood like lumps of granite. Leaving Davies in charge of the party,\r\nI went inside to see the Prefect. He was pleased to see us, and said\r\nthat our arrival had reassured the town to a most extraordinary extent,\r\ndemonstrating to the people that they were not entirely at the mercy of\r\nthe enemy. He then told me of the brutal treatment he had received at\r\nthe hands of the Germans, showing the marks made on his throat by the\r\nfingers of a German lieutenant who had nearly throttled him. They had\r\ngone so far as to lead him out to hang him from a balcony, and he said\r\nhe had only been saved from this terrible fate by the coolness of his\r\nsecretary, who told the German that the Prefect du Nord was one of the\r\nchief officials in France, and that his murder was a serious matter, not\r\nlightly to be undertaken. The Prefect gave me the German officer's name,\r\nand said, \"If ever you come across him, do not let him go\". I promised I\r\nwould not. The Prefect then went on to say that the Germans had been\r\nquite worried over the fight at Cassel, and they had got the idea into\r\ntheir heads that there was a large force of English round about Cassel.\r\nTwo German officers had been wounded in the fight, one seriously and the\r\nother only slightly. There were, he said, about fifty French and some\r\nfew English wounded in the town; they had been left there by the\r\nGermans, and if I signed a proclamation to say I had taken the town they\r\ncould be evacuated to Dunkirk, otherwise the town would be held\r\nresponsible. I therefore made out and signed the following Proclamation:\r\n\r\n_To the Authorities of the City of Lille._\r\n\r\nI have this day occupied Lille with an armed English and French Force.\r\n\r\n                                        'C. R. Samson,\r\n                                           'Commander, R.N.\r\n                                     Officer in Command of English\r\n                                         Force at Dunkirk.\r\n\r\nI added the latter sentence in order to impress upon the Germans that\r\nthere was a large force at Dunkirk. This proclamation the Prefect\r\nordered to be immediately printed and posted all over the town. I\r\nremained at the Hotel de Ville until late in the afternoon, and as by\r\nthen it was found out that the Germans had not left any transports\r\nbehind, and that there was no chance of any French troops being sent to\r\nLille, I reluctantly decided that I ought to return to Dunkirk. We had\r\nan ovation on our return journey through the streets, and our cars were\r\nfull of flowers, chocolate, cigarettes, &c.; the dense crowds cheered\r\nthemselves hoarse, and one felt rather as I imagined a Roman General\r\nused to feel on being given a Triumph. The only mishap was when an\r\nexcitable individual threw a bottle of beer at me which smashed the\r\nscreen and gave me a severe blow on the jaw; I fancy he must have had\r\nGerman sympathies.\r\n\r\n'On our return to Dunkirk the French General, Bidon, was most\r\ncomplimentary concerning our expedition, which he considered had been of\r\ngreat value.'\r\n\r\nThe fight at Cassel had inspired the people of the district with a\r\nplenary belief in the powers of the little English force. A few days\r\nlater, while Commander Samson was on a reconnaissance near Armentieres,\r\nhe was stopped by an excited civilian in a motor-car who offered to\r\nconduct him to a place where he might kill some Germans. The Germans, it\r\nappeared, were from two to three thousand in number, with two batteries\r\nof artillery, and were going from Lille to Douai. 'Personally', says Air\r\nCommodore Samson, 'I thought about two thousand Germans rather a tough\r\nproposition for four Englishmen and one unreliable old Maxim, and I\r\nregretted that we could not carry out the slaughter he desired. He was\r\nvery crest-fallen, and said, \"But I will come too\".'\r\n\r\nThe motor-car work was daily gaining in importance; what was needed was\r\na stronger force and armoured cars. Two of the cars were fitted with\r\nimprovised armour made of boiler-plate at the _Forges et Chantiers de\r\nFrance_, the big shipbuilding firm of Dunkirk, and application was made\r\nto the home authorities for a larger force of marines and specially\r\ndesigned armoured cars. The First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. Winston\r\nChurchill) and the Director of the Air Department (Captain Murray\r\nSueter) were quick to support any enterprise that showed life and\r\npromise; on the 8th of September there arrived a reinforcement of 250\r\nmarines under Major Armstrong, most of them reservists and pensioners,\r\nbut stout men when it came to a fight. Further, Wing Commander Samson\r\ngot into touch with Captain Goldsmith, of the General Headquarters\r\nIntelligence Department, and, by his efforts, was put in control of the\r\ngendarmes in the villages of the zone where he was operating. The\r\naeroplanes daily watched the movements of German troops along the roads,\r\nand the motor-cars, assisted sometimes by the infantry, carried out\r\nsweeps and drives, to surround parties of German horsemen or cyclists.\r\nThere were some fights. On the 13th of September there was a brush with\r\nsome German cavalry patrols, on the Albert road, just outside the town\r\nof Doullens. 'We got out of the cars', says Air Commodore Samson, 'and\r\nopened fire with rifles at about five hundred yards range. We hit five\r\nof them. Three were killed, and one was picked up severely wounded. We\r\ntook him to a hospital in Doullens, where he died without recovering\r\nconsciousness. It rather made me feel a brute seeing this poor fellow\r\ndying, and War seemed a beastly business. He was a rather half-starved\r\nlooking fellow, and looked as if he had been on short rations for a long\r\ntime. It was rather a repugnant job searching him whilst he was passing\r\naway from this life, but it had to be done. Goldsmith, who could read\r\nGerman, found from his papers that he belonged to the First Squadron of\r\nthe 26th Dragoons, Wurtemberg. He had a little child's atlas with which\r\nto find his way about the country, and the map of France was about three\r\ninches square, with only the names of half a dozen towns on it.'\r\n\r\nThe Naval Air Service now looked about for an advanced inland base, with\r\nan aerodrome, for their aeroplane and motor-car reconnaissances. They\r\nfound one at the village of Morbecque, about three miles south of\r\nHazebrouck, and just north of the forest of Nieppe. There, on the 19th\r\nof September, they established the headquarters of the unit. Most of the\r\nofficers and men were housed in an old chateau by the favour of Madame\r\nla Baronne de la Grange, who had shown a fine example to her villagers\r\nby remaining on duty, and had so impressed the Germans that they left\r\nthe village untouched. Two aeroplanes and six armoured cars and lorries\r\nwere the equipment of headquarters, and what in the navy is called the\r\nlower deck personnel numbered 187 marines and 31 naval ratings. Most of\r\nthe work continued to be done by the motor-cars. Some of the lorries\r\nwere armoured with boiler-plate by the shipbuilding firm at Dunkirk, and\r\nnew armoured cars began to arrive in driblets from England. A cyclist\r\nforce was raised from the marines, and a number of French boys who knew\r\nthe country well were embodied in a boy scout unit. The main idea of\r\nthese preparations was to organize attacks on the German lines of\r\ncommunication in the zone of country between Lille and Valenciennes. The\r\ntroops for this purpose were to consist of a brigade of French\r\nterritorial infantry with a squadron of Algerian cavalry, popularly\r\nknown as 'Goumiers', and a battery of the famous 'Soixante-quinze' field\r\nguns. The Royal Naval Air Service were to operate, with as big a force\r\nof armoured cars as possible, under the French general in command. On\r\nthe 22nd of September the French troops occupied Douai. The cars made a\r\nreconnaissance to Aniche, between Douai and Valenciennes, and there had\r\na sharp engagement in the streets with German cavalry. Two days later\r\nthey had a stiff fight at Orchies, where a French territorial regiment,\r\ndetached to guard the route between Lille and Douai, was being heavily\r\nattacked by two German battalions. The cars helped to extricate the\r\nFrench troops and covered their retirement to Douai. But the German\r\nforces in this northern territory were being reinforced strongly, and\r\nreconnaissance by road became difficult. When Wing Commander Samson, on\r\nthe day after the fight at Aniche, was required to make a reconnaissance\r\nto Cantin, a village three or four miles to the south of Douai along the\r\nCambrai road, he started off in a Talbot touring car with Sub-Lieutenant\r\nLord Annesley and Lieutenant F. R. Samson. They had two rifles, ten\r\nrounds of ammunition, and three automatic pistols. 'It appeared\r\nperfectly evident', he says, 'that between us and Cantin there were not\r\nonly the German guns, but plenty of German infantry. I must confess that\r\nthe three of us did not at all relish the idea of ambling into the whole\r\nGerman Army and the local von Kluck in a touring car, but the job had to\r\nbe carried out to keep up our good name and the reputation of the\r\nR.N.A.S.'\r\n\r\nThe Germans were in force, as he expected, and after a brisk engagement\r\nhe returned to Douai. The Douai operations, which were to have been an\r\nattack on the German lines of communication, now became a defence of\r\nDouai against the Germans. By the 29th of September Douai was virtually\r\nin a state of siege, and it became a question whether the French troops\r\ncould be extricated. On the afternoon of the 1st of October the end\r\ncame. By that time the Germans had got into the town and were firing at\r\nthe Hotel de Ville from the housetops. 'A shouting mob of cyclists and\r\ninfantry', says Air Commodore Samson, 'rushed into the courtyard of the\r\nHotel de Ville, yelling out that we were surrounded, and the Germans had\r\ntaken the Pont d'Esquerchin. I went to General Plantey and said that\r\nthe only thing to do was to recapture the bridge and drive the Germans\r\naway from that sector. He agreed, and said that if I would lead the way\r\nwith my cars he would follow with what of the troops he could get to\r\nfight. There was no doubt that if we did not do something a wholesale\r\nsurrender was certain. I strongly objected to being mixed up in that. I\r\nfelt certain that if we could only start a fight the morale would\r\nimprove and that we would have every chance of extricating the whole\r\nforce from its predicament. I led out our cars therefore from the Hotel\r\nde Ville, and forcing our way through crowds of infantry and civilians\r\nwe reached a corner where I found about four hundred Infantry. I\r\nimplored, and swore, and ordered them to follow us against the enemy,\r\nbut only one came, jumping on to the step of the last car. From this\r\ncorner a straight street four hundred yards long led to a bridge over\r\nthe canal, which bridge was held by the Germans. As we went along this\r\nroad I certainly thought that here was the end of our little party, and\r\nI felt very guilty at bringing Armstrong, Coode, and the other fine\r\nfellows to death for no purpose except to keep up the Pride of the\r\nService. The fact that the infantry would not come on after us made us\r\nvery fierce, and I am certain, speaking for myself, that this feeling of\r\nanger made us far braver than we had felt at first. I took the cars to\r\nthe head of the bridge and then halted them, and we opened fire along\r\nthe roadways which ran on both sides of the canal and along the road\r\nahead of us. I ordered the marines out of the cars on to the roadway,\r\nand told them to keep up a hot fire on the Germans who were on the\r\nopposite bank. Going myself with one marine on to the bridge I saw some\r\nHuns on board two barges which were alongside the far bank, and emptied\r\nmy magazine at them. I can remember to this day the sound one of their\r\nbullets made as it hit the girder alongside my face. We were so excited\r\nthat I am afraid our fire was very wild, but it made up for lack of\r\naccuracy by its volume, our three machine-guns firing like mad. We kept\r\nup this game for about five minutes, when I saw the Germans clearing off\r\nin all directions. I ordered, \"Cease fire\", and ordered all on board the\r\ncars. I then led the cars at full speed along the main Henin-Lietard\r\nroad, intending to get to the position we had held in the morning, as\r\nfrom there we could cover the retreat of the French and command the\r\napproaches to the Pont d'Esquerchin.... I knew that in front of us there\r\nwas a double trench across the road, and which entailed cars stopping\r\nand reversing to get through in the gap left between the two trenches.\r\nJust short of this obstacle was a side road leading to Beaumont. I\r\ndetermined, if we met the enemy at the trench, to hold the corner at the\r\nside road as long as we could, hoping that the Infantry would follow on.\r\nThis side road would be the line of approach of the cavalry division\r\nreported close to Beaumont. On arriving at the corner we encountered a\r\nvery heavy fire coming from the trench and the high ground close to it.\r\nIt would have been useless to have attempted to go on against that\r\nvolume of fire, so we stopped at the corner, where we got some shelter\r\nfrom a cottage, and opened fire with the machine-guns from the two\r\narmoured cars, whilst the rest of us lay down on the road and kept up a\r\nhot fire with rifles.\r\n\r\n'We held out at the corner for nearly fifteen minutes until the Germans\r\nopened fire with field guns from Le Polygone; the situation then got too\r\nhot, as shrapnel was bursting all round us, and the cottage was quickly\r\ndemolished by high explosives. I therefore gave the order to retire, and\r\nwe jumped on board the cars and went along the Cuincy-Esquerchin road.\r\nAfter we had put a mile between us and the corner I halted to see how we\r\nhad fared. Our casualties now consisted of eight men wounded. All the\r\ncars had many bullet-marks, but no serious damage had been done to them,\r\nexcept one of the armoured cars had a bullet through its radiator,\r\ncausing it to lose practically all its water. We only had about 200\r\nrounds of ammunition left, and were running pretty short of petrol,\r\notherwise all was well with us.... I considered that we had done\r\neverything we could to open a line of retreat for the infantry, and that\r\nwe had held out at the corner as long as was possible. As it happened we\r\nhad cleared the way for the French, as the general got 2,500 infantry\r\nout of the town across the Pont d'Esquerchin and keeping close to the\r\ncanal bank he had got them well clear of the Huns without firing a shot,\r\nwhilst we were fighting them at the corner. I am afraid that a good\r\nnumber remained in the town and were captured. General Plantey was kind\r\nenough to write to say that if it had not been for the English cars who\r\nhad opened the door he could not have extricated his force.\r\n\r\n'Just short of Beaumont I came across the cavalry division. I went up to\r\nthe General, who was a fine martial figure surrounded by an escort of\r\nCuirassiers with steel breast-plates. After I had told him what had\r\nhappened, I said that there was every probability of the Douai Force\r\nhaving surrendered, but there was a chance of them having got out whilst\r\nwe were holding the cross-roads. He was complimentary about our\r\nperformance and said we had done all we could. He recommended that I\r\nshould return to Morbecque and report to General Aston. He said that he\r\nwas not pushing on any farther, but was going to retire to Beaumont. I\r\ntherefore went through Beaumont to Bethune and back to Morbecque, where\r\nwe were received as if we had risen from the dead. Briggs told me that\r\nthey had fully expected never to see us again. I went to bed after\r\ntelephoning to General Paris, who had relieved General Aston in command\r\nof the Marines. General Paris sent the following report to the\r\nAdmiralty: \"Commander Samson and all ranks appear to have behaved very\r\ngallantly in difficult circumstances, and I consider his action was\r\nperfectly correct.\"'\r\n\r\nThese motor-car operations were no part of the war in the air. But they\r\nwere carried out by the Royal Naval Air Service, and they illustrate the\r\nimmense diversity of business which was undertaken by that service\r\nduring the course of the war. Off the coast of Cornwall or over the\r\nrivers of West Africa, in raids on German cities or in expeditions to\r\nassist beleaguered Allies, the Naval Air Service were incessantly active\r\non the fringe of things. They were sailors and adventurers by tradition;\r\nthey adapted themselves to circumstance, and made the best of what they\r\nfound. Their courage put new heart into desperate men, and their\r\nhumanity (the greatest tradition of the British navy) added lustre to\r\ntheir courage. The half-witted pedantry of the German doctrine and\r\npractice of war, which uses brutality as a protective mask for\r\ncowardice, was far from them. It was against that doctrine and practice,\r\nas against an alien enemy, that they fought; and only those who have\r\nbeen guilty of inhuman practices have ever had cause to complain of\r\ntheir cruelty.\r\n\r\nBeyond the usual reconnaissances not very much work was done in the air\r\nfrom headquarters. The available aeroplanes were few, and there were\r\nmany calls on them. Nominally the Dunkirk force was to consist of three\r\nsquadrons of twelve machines each, but in these early days two or three\r\nmachines were, often the most that a squadron could muster. On the 3rd\r\nof September Squadron Commander E. L. Gerrard arrived at Ostend with\r\nthree additional machines intended to operate from Antwerp against\r\nairship sheds in Germany. These machines remained at Ostend, pegged down\r\nunder the lee of the sand dunes, while Squadron Commander Gerrard went\r\nby road to Antwerp to find an aerodrome and to arrange for the proposed\r\nraid. On the 12th of September a violent squall came up from the west\r\nand caught the machines, uprooting or breaking the stakes to which they\r\nwere secured. The machines turned cartwheels along the sands and were\r\ntotally wrecked. The party returned to Dunkirk to refit, and as the\r\nattack on the Zeppelin sheds in Germany was reckoned to be of the first\r\nimportance, Wing Commander Samson, who was ordered to take charge of the\r\nflight, had to give up three of the best machines he had.\r\n\r\nIt was believed at that time that Antwerp would not fall. When the\r\nBritish army was moved north from the Aisne to Ypres, the original idea\r\nof the Allied strategy was resuscitated. That idea had been to take the\r\noffensive in Belgium and to repel the German advance or to make a flank\r\nattack on it. But the German blow had been too heavy and too quick for\r\nthis plan to develop, and in the effort to save Paris the British army\r\nhad been driven far southwards into France. Paris was saved at the\r\nMarne, and now that the Germans had entrenched themselves in a corner of\r\nFrance it was hoped that an attack upon their communications would\r\ncompel them to retreat. Again the Germans were beforehand. When things\r\ncame to a standstill on the Aisne, they concentrated a large force in\r\nBelgium to make a push for the Channel ports. The British naval\r\ndivision, arriving at Antwerp on the 5th of October, could do no more\r\nthan delay the fall of Antwerp by a few days. The Seventh Division of\r\nthe British army, under Sir Henry Rawlinson, which was disembarked at\r\nOstend and Zeebrugge on the 6th of October, found that its task was not\r\nan assault on the German flank but the defence of the Channel ports from\r\na furious German assault.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Naval Air Service carried on. Two attacks were made on\r\nthe airship sheds at Duesseldorf and Cologne. The earlier of these was\r\nmade on the 22nd of September by four aeroplanes, two for each place.\r\nThere was a thick mist extending from the river Roer to some miles east\r\nof the Rhine, and only Flight Lieutenant Collet succeeded in finding his\r\nobjective. He glided down at Duesseldorf from a height of 6,000 feet, the\r\nlast 1,500 feet through the mist, and came in sight of the shed when he\r\nwas a quarter of a mile from it at a height of 400 feet. One of his\r\nbombs fell short; the others probably hit the shed, but failed to\r\nexplode. Germans ran in all directions. All four machines were back in\r\nAntwerp by one o'clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe second and more successful attack was made on the 8th of October,\r\nduring the evacuation of Antwerp. Antwerp was being bombarded, the\r\npanic-stricken retreat of the population had begun, but the Naval Air\r\nService stuck to its aerodrome, and carried out the first notable\r\nair-raid of the war. On the 7th of October the machines at Antwerp had\r\nbeen taken out of their shed and planted in the middle of the aerodrome,\r\nto avoid damage by splinters if the shed should be hit by a shell. On\r\nthe forenoon of the 8th the weather was misty, so Squadron Commander\r\nSpenser Grey and Flight Lieutenant Marix spent the time in tuning up\r\ntheir Sopwith Tabloid machines. In the afternoon there was no\r\nimprovement in the weather, but if an attack was to be made from Antwerp\r\nit was important to start, for the Germans were about to enter the\r\ncity. Flight Lieutenant Marix, starting at 1.30 p.m., flew to\r\nDuesseldorf, dived at the shed, and let go his bombs at a height of 600\r\nfeet. The destruction was complete. The roof fell in within thirty\r\nseconds and flames rose to a height of 500 feet, showing that an\r\ninflated Zeppelin must have been inside. The aeroplane was damaged by a\r\nheavy rifle- and shell-fire, but Lieutenant Marix managed to get back to\r\nwithin twenty miles of Antwerp, and to return to the city by the aid of\r\na bicycle which he borrowed from a peasant. Squadron Commander Spenser\r\nGrey, starting at 1.20 p.m., flew to Cologne, where he found a thick\r\nmist and failed to locate the airship sheds. He dropped his bombs on the\r\nmain railway station in the middle of the town, and got back to Antwerp\r\nat 4.45 p.m. At six o'clock the general evacuation of Antwerp was\r\nordered, and the officers of the Naval Air Service succeeded in reaching\r\nOstend by noon on the following day. The transport and stores had\r\npreceded them. Since the 3rd of October Wing Commander Samson's force\r\nhad been employed in assisting the naval division at Antwerp. Some\r\nseventy motor omnibuses, taken off the streets of the cities of England,\r\nand driven by their civilian drivers, who made up in cheerfulness and\r\nskill for what they lacked in military science, had been employed to\r\ncarry the stores of the naval division, and were escorted by the\r\narmoured cars. Their stay in Antwerp was brief. Where once the Germans\r\nhad succeeded in bringing their big guns within range the end was\r\ncertain. 'I used to find the streets of Antwerp', says Air Commodore\r\nSamson, 'a most depressing sight, thronged as they were with Belgians;\r\nbeautifully dressed ladies were apparently carrying on their usual life,\r\nshopping and promenading as if the siege was a minor affair.' The people\r\nof a great commercial city are slow to realize the facts of war. When\r\nthe realization comes it comes with panic swiftness. The crowd of\r\nrefugees which hurried by all roads out of Antwerp during the night of\r\nthe 9th of October bound for anywhere, and fleeing from the destroyers\r\nof Louvain, was one of the most disheartening spectacles of the war.\r\nThere were some bright spots in the prevailing darkness. One of these\r\nwas General Sir Henry Rawlinson, of the Seventh Division, who took over\r\nthe command at Ostend. 'I came into contact continuously with him for\r\nthe next month,' says Air Commodore Samson, 'and I never saw him\r\ndown-hearted once, even in the worst periods at Ypres. I never left his\r\npresence without feeling that we were bound to win: he was worth an Army\r\nCorps by himself.' The English nurses, who had two omnibus loads of\r\nwounded, are another luminous memory of that awful night. 'They were a\r\nsplendid advertisement for the English race; absolutely unperturbed,\r\ncalm and competent, amidst the surrounding mob of panic-stricken people.\r\nThey impressed me more than I can say. Their one job was to get their\r\nwounded charges safe to Ostend, and that they would do it was evident to\r\nthe most casual observer.'\r\n\r\nThe evacuation of Antwerp put an end to all plans for a British\r\noffensive in Belgium. Ostend was crowded with refugees, and the streets\r\nwere full of distressing scenes. The harbour railway station was a\r\nseething mass of humanity attempting to get on board the few steamers\r\nthat went to England. The British forces, and with them the Royal Naval\r\nAir Service, retreated by stages. Aerodromes were occupied successively\r\nat Thourout, Ypres, and, on the 15th of October, Poperinghe. On this\r\nsame date Zeebrugge and Ostend fell into the hands of the Germans.\r\n'During the last three weeks', says Air Commodore Samson, 'we had been\r\nalways on the go, without a home, without any idea where we were going\r\nto next, without food sometimes, without adequate transport, and yet we\r\nhad kept going because all ranks had pulled their pound and a bit over.'\r\n\r\nThus ended the Belgian adventure of the Naval Air Service. It had been\r\ngood while it lasted. If a force of five thousand skilled and fit men,\r\nwith armoured cars and aeroplanes, had been available for these\r\noperations, the German communications might have been seriously\r\ndisordered. Some critics condemn all such adventures as 'side-shows'.\r\nThey may be right; but it is always to be remembered that the national\r\ncharacter is seen at its best in solitary adventures of this kind, and\r\nthat the British Empire, from the first, was built up by\r\nside-shows--many of them unauthorized by the Government. The experience\r\nof this war, and of former wars, proves only that these enterprises lose\r\na great part of their value if they are timidly designed or\r\nhalf-heartedly executed. To condemn them out and out is to prefer the\r\nGerman plan of empire, which depends wholly on central initiative and\r\ncentral control, to the sporadic energy of the British Empire, which can\r\nnever be killed by a blow aimed at the centre, for its life is in every\r\npart. Military theory, based as it is chiefly on the great campaigns of\r\ncontinental conquerors, has so impressed some of its British students\r\nthat they forget their own nature, renounce their pride, and cheapen\r\ntheir dearest possessions.\r\n\r\nThe overseas work of the Naval Air Service during the closing months of\r\n1914, from the battle of Ypres onwards, can be briefly stated. It\r\nconsisted of help given to the British army, reconnaissances and attacks\r\ncarried out along the occupied coast of Belgium, and two great\r\nair-raids.\r\n\r\nDuring the battle of Ypres one naval aeroplane was working for the First\r\nArmy Corps. Reconnaissances were carried out daily by the few available\r\nmachines. Squadron Commander Davies on three occasions attacked German\r\nmachines in the air; they escaped by planing down to behind their own\r\nlines. Flight Lieutenant Collet, whose aeroplane had been wrecked, flew\r\nas observer to Squadron Commander Davies, and reported the positions of\r\nsix new German batteries. Flight Lieutenant Pierse, in an old\r\ninefficient machine which climbed badly, made many flights along the\r\ncoast, and was wounded by shrapnel in the air over Antwerp.\r\n\r\nMeantime, on the 31st of October, a seaplane base was established at\r\nDunkirk in the works of the shipbuilding company, which occupied a part\r\nof the harbour. Under Squadron Commander J. W. Seddon the seaplanes did\r\nsome good work; they located enemy guns, dropped heavy bombs on Bruges\r\nrailway station, co-operated with the ships' guns in the bombardment of\r\nthe coast, kept a look-out for German submarines, and reported on the\r\nenemy defences.\r\n\r\nThis base at Dunkirk remained an active centre for our seaplane and\r\naeroplane work throughout the war, and did much to defeat the German\r\nplans. The possession of the coast of Flanders had a twofold value for\r\nthe Germans; it served to safeguard the right flank of their invading\r\narmy and it provided them with a base both for their submarine campaign\r\nand for occasional attacks on the naval forces which held the Dover\r\nStraits. There can be no doubt that it was part of their plan to take\r\npermanent possession of the Belgian coast. It is not easy to understand\r\nwhy, before the war, when Zeebrugge and Ostend were made into fortified\r\nharbours, a clause was inserted in the contractors' orders that the mole\r\nat Zeebrugge should be fit to carry hundred-ton guns and to withstand\r\nheavy gun recoil; also, that the Zeebrugge and Ostend locks and basins\r\nshould be capable of accommodating a flotilla of torpedo-boats. These\r\nthings were not done in the interests of England, nor had the Belgian\r\nGovernment any reason to fear naval aggression from the west. The plans\r\nwhich had this beginning were developed and completed during the first\r\ntwo years of the German occupation. Bruges, which was joined by canals\r\nboth to Zeebrugge and Ostend, became the naval headquarters of the\r\nGerman forces, the base for submarines and torpedo-craft, and the centre\r\nfor construction and repair. Everything was organized on a solid basis,\r\nas if to endure; yet at some time during the third year of the war the\r\nenemy must have begun to feel doubtful whether he could keep his hold on\r\nthe Belgian coast. About thirty miles along the coast from Ostend, and\r\nforty or more miles from Zeebrugge, lay the port of Dunkirk, occupied in\r\nstrength by the navies of France and Great Britain, and by the Royal\r\nNaval Air Service. Dunkirk was a thorn in the side of the Germans. The\r\ndocks and harbours at Bruges, Zeebrugge, and Ostend were incessantly\r\nbombed from the air. Ships and works were seriously damaged, but the\r\neffect on the morale of the German forces was even more considerable.\r\nRepeated alarms, which sent all hands to take shelter in dug-outs,\r\ninterfered with the work of every day. In the main basin at Bruges, and\r\nalongside the Zeebrugge mole, shelters, jutting out over the water, were\r\nprovided for submarines and destroyers. The respect felt by the Germans\r\nfor the menace of Dunkirk is perhaps best witnessed by the fierce\r\nnightly attacks from the air which they made on the town during the\r\nlater period of the war. Admiral Sir Reginald Bacon, who commanded the\r\nDover Patrol from April 1915 Until the end of 1917, speaks of these as\r\n'the martyrdom of Dunkirk'. A great many of the houses in the town were\r\nlevelled with the ground. Yet the inhabitants, knowing that they were\r\nmaintaining a force which gave as good as it got, went about their\r\ndaily business cheerful and unperturbed. They were rewarded in the end.\r\nWhen, after the armistice, the last German submarine came through the\r\nlock-gates at Zeebrugge, with her crew fallen in on the fore\r\nsuperstructure, her captain called for three cheers,--'As that's the\r\nlast you'll see of Flanders.' The cheers were given very heartily--an\r\ninvoluntary tribute to the four years' work of the naval services at\r\nDunkirk.\r\n\r\nAll these things were yet to come when the third of the naval aeroplane\r\nraids into enemy territory was made on the 21st of November 1914. This,\r\nthe successful attack on the Zeppelin sheds at Friedrichshafen, Lake\r\nConstance, was planned and executed to perfection. Lieutenant Pemberton\r\nBilling, of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, left England on the 21st\r\nof October under Admiralty instructions. He arrived at Belfort on the\r\n24th and, by the courtesy of the French general in command, obtained\r\npermission to use the aerodrome within the fortifications and its large\r\ndirigible shed as the starting-point for a raid. German spies were\r\nbelieved to be at work in Belfort, so arrangements were made for the\r\nmachines to be brought into the place by road transport at night, and\r\nfor their pilots to be boarded and lodged, during the whole of their\r\nstay, in the dirigible shed. Having completed these preliminaries,\r\nLieutenant Billing carried out discreet inquiries which enabled him to\r\ndraw up a chart of the proposed route, a complete plan of the Zeppelin\r\nfactory, and a draft of instructions for the proposed raid.\r\n\r\nMeantime the French had themselves been meditating a raid on\r\nFriedrichshafen, and the Governor of Belfort had received some valuable\r\nreports on the factory and the prevailing weather conditions. After some\r\ndiscussion it was decided that as Zeppelins were intended to assist in\r\nthe destruction of the British fleet, the Royal Naval Air Service\r\nshould be privileged to pay the first visit, but that this privilege\r\nshould lapse if the visit were not paid within thirty days.\r\n\r\nIn the season of late autumn, when the barometer is high and the air\r\ncalm, the whole of the Swiss plateau and the Rhine valley bordering it\r\nis often plunged in a thick mist which reaches to a height of about\r\n3,000 feet. Above this sea of mist the air is clear and the flight of an\r\naeroplane safe and easy. The course chosen from Belfort to Lake\r\nConstance, a distance of about 125 miles, was bent, like an elbow at an\r\nobtuse angle, round the northern border of Switzerland, so that Swiss\r\nneutrality should not be violated. It lay over country much of which is\r\nwooded and sparsely inhabited--first from Belfort to Muelhausen, thence\r\nover the Black Forest and some groups of wooded peaks to a point north\r\nof Schaffhausen. Here the prescribed course was to bend southwards,\r\nbetween the two arms of Lake Constance which stretch to the north-west,\r\nand when once the lake was reached the objective would be full in view.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of October Lieutenant Pemberton Billing returned to England\r\nto collect men and machines. A squadron of four Avros, with 80\r\nhorse-power Gnome engines, had already been formed at Manchester under\r\nSquadron Commander P. Shepherd. The four pilots were:\r\n\r\n  Squadron Commander E. F. Briggs.\r\n  Flight Commander J. T. Babington.\r\n  Flight Lieutenant S. V. Sippe.\r\n  Flight Sub-Lieutenant R. P. Cannon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Friedrichshafen Raid.]\r\n\r\nThere were eleven air mechanics. The machines and stores were shipped at\r\nSouthampton for Le Havre and arrived in Belfort by night on the 13th of\r\nNovember. When he reached Belfort, Squadron Commander Shepherd fell ill;\r\nmoreover, the weather was bad, with a falling barometer and a strong\r\neasterly wind. At last, on Saturday, the 21st of November, conditions\r\nimproved and the raid took place. At half-past nine in the morning the\r\nfour machines were lined up on the western side of the aerodrome to\r\nundergo engine tests and bomb-release tests. They were then dispatched,\r\nat intervals of five minutes, Squadron Commander Briggs, on machine 873,\r\nbeing followed by Flight Commander Babington on machine 875, and Flight\r\nLieutenant Sippe on machine 874. Sub-Lieutenant Cannon's machine failed\r\nto rise and broke its tail skid. The other three reached Friedrichshafen\r\nabout noon, almost together, and wrought havoc on the Zeppelin works.\r\nSquadron Commander Briggs was brought down by machine-gun fire, which\r\nriddled his petrol tank. The other two returned in safety.\r\n\r\nTwo accounts of this raid shall be quoted, one from the air, the other\r\nfrom the ground. Here is Flight Lieutenant Sippe's log:\r\n\r\n  Attack on Friedrichshafen, 21st November 1914.\r\n\r\n  '9.55 a.m.   Left Belfort. Shaped course for Basle,\r\n               following Nos. 873 and 875.\r\n\r\n  10.25 a.m.   Arrived Basle, passed to north, observed\r\n               No. 873 going away to south, overtook\r\n               No. 875. No. 873 several miles to starboard.\r\n               Followed Rhine at height of\r\n               about 5,000 feet, keeping to north.\r\n\r\n  11 a.m.      Above clouds in Rhine Valley. No. 873\r\n               passed across and took up position ahead\r\n               and about a mile to port. Continued\r\n               to Schaffhausen, when suddenly lost\r\n               sight of 873. No. 875 about two miles\r\n               astern and about same height.\r\n\r\n  11.30 a.m.   Arrived extreme end of lake and came\r\n               down to within 10 feet of water. Continued\r\n               at this height over lake, passing\r\n               Constance at a very low altitude, as\r\n               considered less likelihood of being seen.\r\n               Crossed lake and hugged north shore\r\n               until five miles from objective. Started\r\n               climb and reached 1,200 feet. Observed\r\n               twelve or fourteen shrapnels\r\n               bursting slightly north of Friedrichshafen.\r\n               Presumed these were directed\r\n               against No. 873.\r\n\r\n  11.55 a.m.   When half a mile from sheds put machine\r\n               into dive, and came down to 700 feet.\r\n               Observed men lined up to right of shed,\r\n               number estimated 300-500. Dropped\r\n               one bomb in enclosure to put gunners\r\n               off aim, and, when in correct position,\r\n               two into works and shed. The fourth\r\n               bomb failed to release. During this\r\n               time very heavy fire, mitrailleuse and\r\n               rifle, was being kept up, and shells were\r\n               being very rapidly fired. Dived and\r\n               flew north until out of range of guns,\r\n               then turned back to waterside shed to\r\n               try and release fourth bomb. Bomb\r\n               would not release; was fired on by two\r\n               machine guns (probably mitrailleuse),\r\n               dived down to surface of lake and made\r\n               good my escape.\r\n\r\n  1.50 p.m.    Arrived Belfort.'\r\n\r\nThe other account was given by a Swiss engineer who saw the raid from an\r\nhotel near the Zeppelin sheds. He counted nine bombs which fell in an\r\narea of 700 square yards round the works and sheds, and he said the\r\nearth and debris were thrown up to a height of 25 feet. Each machine had\r\nfour twenty-pound bombs; one of Flight Lieutenant Sippe's bombs, as has\r\nbeen seen, failed to release. That leaves two bombs of the twelve to be\r\naccounted for; these fell on the sheds themselves, one greatly damaging\r\na Zeppelin, the other destroying the gas-works, which exploded and sent\r\nup gigantic flames in the sky. The bombs made the town tremble; the\r\nmilitary officers lost their heads and gave contradictory orders to the\r\ntroops. The mitrailleuse section, however, kept cool, and fired from 200\r\nto 250 shots before Squadron Commander Briggs was brought down. The\r\nthree British biplanes crossed, recrossed, and circled at such a speed\r\nover Friedrichshafen that many onlookers thought there were six of them.\r\nSquadron Commander Briggs was attacked and injured after landing; when\r\ncaptured by the military he was nearly fainting, and was transported to\r\nthe large Weingarten hospital at Friedrichshafen, where he was tended\r\nwith every care. In fact the local officers regarded him with\r\nadmiration, much as the British public regarded Captain von Mueller of\r\nthe _Emden_.\r\n\r\nThe damage done was severe, and now that the horse was stolen the German\r\nauthorities took every care to lock the stable door. A great network\r\nconstruction was built above the sheds. The Bavarian regiments and the\r\nnight sentinels were doubled; the number of mitrailleuses and\r\nanti-aircraft guns was much increased. Five powerful searchlights were\r\ninstalled on the hills around the town and were kept at work all night.\r\nTwo additional gun-boats were stationed in front of the floating shed.\r\nAt eight o'clock every evening all the lights of the town were put out.\r\nEvery civilian was compelled to carry a passport, and no foreigners were\r\nallowed to approach. The Zeppelin sheds were not attacked again, but all\r\nthe men and all the material required for these additional defences were\r\nkept out of the war by the four hours' adventure of three British\r\npilots. So true it is that the best defence is attack.\r\n\r\nThe pilots deserve all praise for their admirable navigation, and the\r\nmachines must not be forgotten. There have since been many longer and\r\ngreater raids, but this flight of 250 miles, into gunfire, across enemy\r\ncountry, in the frail little Avro with its humble horse-power, can\r\ncompare as an achievement with the best of them, and some part of the\r\ncredit must be spared for those who planned it and for those who tended\r\nand prepared the machines. The men on the ground, or in the engine-room,\r\nor in the racing stable, who have no part in the excitement and renown\r\nof action, are the invisible creators of victory.\r\n\r\nShortly after the raid the Swiss Government complained that the British\r\naviators had flown over Swiss territory, and had thereby violated Swiss\r\nneutrality. Flight Lieutenant Sippe's log, which has been quoted above,\r\ncertainly gives some ground for this contention. The British Foreign\r\nOffice, in their reply, said that instructions had been given to the\r\nBritish aviators not to fly over Swiss territory, that it was not their\r\nintention to do so, and that it had been the belief of the Foreign\r\nOffice that they had not done so. The British Government assured the\r\nSwiss Government that if Swiss neutrality had been violated it had been\r\nby inadvertence, and expressed their great regret that any British\r\naeroplanes should have flown over any part of Swiss territory. At the\r\nsame time the British Government were careful to point out that the\r\nInternational Congress of 1910 had failed to come to any agreement as to\r\nthe recognition of territory in the air, and that Great Britain's desire\r\nto respect the wishes of the Swiss Government should not be taken as an\r\nadmission 'that Great Britain is necessarily bound in all cases to\r\nrespect a doctrine which, however it may be viewed by herself, is not\r\naccepted and may not be acted upon by other Powers'. This point of law\r\nhas since been settled. The International Air Convention of 1921, which\r\nhas been signed by the Allied Powers, sets forth in its first article\r\n'that every Power has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the air\r\nspace above its territory'.\r\n\r\nThe fourth raid into enemy territory, this time by seaplanes, was\r\ncarried out on Christmas Day of 1914. How deeply the threat of the\r\nZeppelins had impressed the public imagination and the minds of those\r\nwho were responsible for the Royal Naval Air Service may be seen by\r\nthis--that all four naval raids were directed against Zeppelin sheds.\r\nThis fourth raid, though it did not succeed in destroying any German\r\nairship, achieved some useful observation, and had the incidental\r\nadvantage that it brought the navy into conflict with Zeppelins, and\r\ndiminished the portentous respect in which they had been held. Two naval\r\nofficers, famous by their achievements in the war--Commodore R. J. B.\r\nKeyes and Commodore R. Y. Tyrwhitt--were in command of the supporting\r\nforce. Two light cruisers, with eight destroyers of the Third Flotilla,\r\nsailed from Harwich for the Bight of Heligoland at 5.0 a.m. on Thursday,\r\nthe 24th of December, escorting the three seaplane-carriers, each with\r\nthree seaplanes aboard. The air was clear and the sea calm, but it was\r\nbitterly cold. The _Arethusa_, preceded by a screen of four destroyers,\r\nled the way; she was followed, at intervals of one and a half cables, or\r\n300 yards, by the _Engadine_ and _Riviera_. A mile behind, with a\r\nsimilar screen of four destroyers, came the _Undaunted_, followed by the\r\n_Empress_. Two destroyers and ten submarines, under the command of\r\nCommodore Keyes, co-operated with this force, to fend off the attacks of\r\nhostile ships and to pick up the aviators on their return. The purpose\r\nof the raid was to destroy the airship sheds at Cuxhaven, but the\r\nAdmiralty were eager to get such information as might be obtainable\r\nwithout detriment to this purpose, and the seaplanes were instructed to\r\nreport, if possible, on the numbers and classes of ships inside the\r\nbasin at Wilhelmshaven, or anchored in the Schillig Roads (that is, the\r\nestuary of Wilhelmshaven), or in the mouth of the Elbe. The little fleet\r\nmade straight for the Bight and reached a position some twelve miles\r\nnorth of Heligoland by 6.0 a.m. on Christmas morning. No time was lost\r\nin getting the machines out; seven of the nine got away soon after 7.0\r\na.m., the other two could not get off the water, and were hoisted in\r\nagain. Then the supporting force cruised for some hours off Heligoland\r\nto await the return of the machines. At a very early hour in the morning\r\nit had become evident from the agitated condition of the German wireless\r\nthat the presence of the squadron had been discovered, but they were not\r\nattacked by enemy ships of war. A ship was seen approaching from between\r\nHeligoland and the mainland, but she turned back before she could be\r\nidentified. At 7.35 a.m. a Zeppelin was seen about ten miles distant,\r\ncoming from the direction of Heligoland, and at 7.55 a hostile seaplane\r\nfrom the same direction. The seaplane attacked the squadron and dropped\r\nfour bombs, which were not bad shots, but failed to hit. The squadron\r\nreplied with anti-aircraft guns, maxims, and rifles. When the Zeppelin\r\nwas within 11,000 yards, fire was opened on her with 6-inch guns and\r\nshrapnel shell at extreme elevation. The _Undaunted_ burst several\r\nshells fairly close to her; she retreated to Heligoland and was not seen\r\nagain. Soon after ten o'clock three of the British raiding seaplanes,\r\nhaving returned from the raid, were sighted and recovered, but the\r\ncruisers continued to await the return of the remaining four. A second\r\nZeppelin and several hostile seaplanes now approached from the\r\nsouthward; all dropped bombs without success. The British seaplanes, it\r\nwas known, carried fuel sufficient only for a three-hours' flight; when\r\nthey had been gone for four and a half hours it was evident that they\r\nwere not likely to be in the air, so the cruiser and destroyer squadron,\r\nafter searching the waters of the Frisian coast, reluctantly shaped its\r\ncourse for home. Commodore Tyrwhitt, in his report of the encounter with\r\nthe German aircraft, remarks that both Zeppelins practised the same\r\nmethod of attack, namely, to get behind the line of ships and to drop\r\ntheir bombs on the fore and aft line. Their speed was great, but they\r\nseemed to suffer from one disability which made them clumsy to handle.\r\n'It was repeatedly noted', he says, 'that the Zeppelins, when altering\r\ncourse, invariably \"wore\", and did not appear to be able to turn head to\r\nwind. This made them ridiculously easy to avoid in spite of their speed,\r\nwhich was surprising.' That is to say, the Zeppelins did not tack.\r\nPerhaps it was their policy to maintain rapid movement, so as not to\r\npresent a stationary target. To alter their course in the eye of the\r\nwind they fell off from the wind and, after presenting their stern to\r\nit, came up on the other side. 'The seaplane attacks', the commodore\r\nadds, 'were of a much more active nature, but they do not appear to have\r\ndiscovered the art of hitting.' German seaplanes, when they approached\r\nend on, were very like British seaplanes, so the order was given to wait\r\nfor a bomb to be dropped before opening fire. This order caused\r\n'considerable merriment' among the ships' companies. 'I am quite\r\nconvinced', says Commodore Tyrwhitt, 'that, given ordinary sea-room, our\r\nships have nothing to fear from seaplanes and Zeppelins.'\r\n\r\nFor eight hours, in perfect weather, the British squadron occupied\r\nGerman waters just off the principal German naval ports. The Germans\r\nknew the composition of the British force, and as visibility was\r\nextraordinarily good they must have known also that there were no\r\nsupports; but their navy made no attempt to interfere with the British\r\nships.\r\n\r\nThree of the four missing pilots returned, and were picked up by\r\nsubmarine E 11, close to Norderney Gat. They were there attacked by a\r\nhostile airship; the submarine, as soon as it had taken the pilots on\r\nboard, was forced to dive, and the machines were abandoned. The missing\r\npilot, Flight Commander F. E. T. Hewlett, had engine failure, and came\r\ndown on the sea near a Dutch trawler; he was picked up and detained for\r\na time in Holland. The Cuxhaven sheds were not located, but the German\r\nnaval ports were pretty thoroughly surveyed, and a good deal of damage\r\nwas done by bomb-dropping. Seaplane No. 136, piloted by Flight Commander\r\nC. F. Kilner, with Lieutenant Erskine Childers as observer, flew over\r\nthe Schillig Roads, and reported, lying at anchor there, seven\r\nbattleships of the _Deutschland_ and _Braunschweig_ classes, three\r\nbattle cruisers, apparently the _Seydlitz_, _Moltke_, and _Von der\r\nTann_, one four-funnelled cruiser, probably the _Roon_, two old light\r\ncruisers of the _Frauenlob_ and _Bremen_ classes, ten destroyers, one\r\nlarge two-funnelled merchantman or liner, and three ships which appeared\r\nto be colliers. Anti-aircraft guns, firing shrapnel, were used against\r\nthe seaplane and very nearly scored a direct hit. On issuing from the\r\nRoads the officers in the seaplane saw a large number of ships in the\r\nnorthern part of the fairway of the Weser, and two destroyers east of\r\nWangeroog. As a result of this reconnaissance a part of the German fleet\r\nwas moved from Cuxhaven to various places farther up the Kiel canal.\r\n\r\nThe day before the Cuxhaven raid the Germans made their first raid over\r\nEngland, and dropped their first bomb on English soil. The air raids\r\nover England during the war were many and serious; they were an\r\nimportant and characteristic part of the German plan of campaign, and\r\ntheir story must be told separately. They began with a curious timid\r\nlittle adventure. On the 21st of December a German aeroplane made its\r\nappearance above Dover; it dropped a bomb which was aimed, no doubt, at\r\nsome part of the harbour, but fell harmlessly in the sea. The aeroplane\r\nthen went home. Three days later, on the 24th, a single aeroplane again\r\ndropped a bomb, this time on English soil near Dover. This was the\r\nprelude to a formidable series of air raids, which, however, were not\r\nmade in strength till well on in the following year.\r\n\r\nThe close of the year 1914, and of the first five months of the war, saw\r\nthe German assault on the European commonwealth held, though not\r\nvanquished. If the German plans had succeeded, the war would have been\r\nover before the coming of the new year. The failure of these plans was\r\ninevitably a longer business. The best-informed judges, from Lord\r\nKitchener downwards, recognized that this was not a war which could be\r\nended at a blow. A great nation does not so readily give up the dreams\r\non which it has been fed for the better part of a hundred years. The\r\nGerman people had been educated for the war, taught to regard the war as\r\ntheir brightest hope, to concentrate their imagination on what it might\r\ndo for them, and to devote their energies to carrying it through. The\r\nmovement of so great a mass of opinion and zeal, when once it has begun,\r\nis not soon reversed. Germany settled down to the business of winning\r\nthe war. The Germans had had some partial successes, in the destruction\r\nof a Russian army at Tannenberg, and of a British squadron at Coronel.\r\nThey began to realize the immensity of their task, but they still\r\nbelieved that they could perform it, and that if they could not beat\r\ndown the opposing forces, they could wear them down.\r\n\r\nMonth by month, as the war continued, it spread, and involved nation\r\nafter nation. In the first summer Japan came in, and in the first\r\nautumn, Turkey. As the number of Germany's enemies increased, so did the\r\ntale of Great Britain's responsibilities. British troops, during the\r\ncourse of the war, fought upon every front, against every one of the\r\nPowers allied to Germany; British help in men, or money or material, was\r\ngiven to every one of Germany's enemies. Already in August 1914 British\r\nnaval and military forces were operating in Togoland, in the Cameroons,\r\nand at Dar-es-Salaam in German East Africa. By November Basra, in the\r\nPersian Gulf, was occupied, and the Mesopotamian campaign had begun. In\r\naddition to all these new burdens, the anxieties of administration in\r\nmany countries, and especially in Egypt, which owed allegiance to the\r\nSultan, were increased tenfold by the war. Those who had pleased\r\nthemselves with the fancy that Great Britain is an island were rudely\r\nundeceived.\r\n\r\nAircraft had proved their utility, or rather their necessity, in the\r\ncampaign on the western front; they were not less needed in all these\r\ndistant theatres. In uncivilized or thinly peopled countries a single\r\nsquadron of aeroplanes may save the work of whole battalions of\r\ninfantry. The great problem of the first year of the war was a problem\r\nof manufacture and training, the problem, indeed, of the creation of\r\nvalues. With the instruments that we had at the outbreak of war we had\r\ndone all that we could, and more than all that we had promised; but what\r\nwe had achieved, at the best, was something very like a deadlock. The\r\nwar, if it was to be won, could only be won in the workshop and the\r\ntraining-school. These places are not much in the public eye; but it was\r\nin these places that the nation prepared itself for the decisive\r\nstruggle. The New Army, and an air force that ultimately numbered not\r\nhundreds but tens of thousands, emerged from the discipline of\r\npreparation. The process took time; months and even years passed before\r\nits results were apparent. But some account of it must be given at this\r\npoint in the story if the events of the later years of the war in the\r\nair are to be made intelligible or credible.\r\n\r\nThe greatest creation of all, the temper of the new force, was not so\r\nmuch a creation as a discovery. Good machines and trained men, however\r\ngreat their number, are not enough to win a war. War is a social affair,\r\nand wars are won by well-knit societies. The community of habits and\r\nideas which unites civilized mankind is too loose a bond for this\r\npurpose; it has too much in it of mere love of comfort and ease and\r\ndiversion. Patriotism will go farther, but for the making of a\r\nfirst-class fighting force patriotism is not enough. A narrower and\r\ntighter loyalty and a closer companionship are needed, as every regiment\r\nknows, before men will cheerfully go to meet the ultimate realities of\r\nwar. They must live together and work together and think together. Their\r\nsociety must be governed by a high and exacting code, imposed by\r\nconsent, as the creed of all. The creation, or the tended growth, of\r\nsuch a society, that is to say, of the new air force, was one of the\r\nmiracles of the war. The recruits of the air were young, some of them no\r\nmore than boys. Their training lasted only a few months. They put their\r\nhome life behind them, or kept it only as a fortifying memory, and threw\r\nthemselves with fervour and abandon into the work to be done. Pride in\r\ntheir squadron became a part of their religion. The demands made upon\r\nthem, which, it might reasonably have been believed, were greater than\r\nhuman nature can endure, were taken by them as a matter of course; they\r\nfulfilled them, and went beyond. They were not a melancholy company;\r\nthey had something of the lightness of the element in which they moved.\r\nIndeed, it would be difficult to find, in the world's history, any body\r\nof fighters who, for sheer gaiety and zest, could hold a candle to them.\r\nThey have opened up a new vista for their country and for mankind. Their\r\nstory, if it could ever be fully and truly written, is the Epic of\r\nYouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE EXPANSION OF THE AIR FORCE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out, the Royal Flying Corps, as has been told, took\r\nthe field with all its available forces. The four squadrons which were\r\nready for service went abroad at once. In their desire to rise to their\r\ngreat opportunity the officers appointed to command in France made\r\nsomething like a clean sweep, taking abroad with them almost all the\r\nefficient pilots, and almost all the serviceable machines. There were at\r\nFarnborough at that time a small group of officers belonging to the\r\nnewly formed Indian Flying Corps, and another small group training as a\r\nnucleus for a South African Aviation Corps. All these were swept into\r\nthe net. Captains H. L. Reilly and D. Le G. Pitcher, of the Indian\r\nFlying Corps, were at once made flying officers of No. 4 Squadron; three\r\nothers, that is to say, Captain S. D. Massy (an early pioneer, who had\r\nflown with the Air Battalion during 1911, and was commandant of the\r\nIndian Central Flying School at Sitapur), Captain C. G. Hoare, and\r\nLieutenant C. L. N. Newall, were posted to squadrons forming at home.\r\nThree officers of the South African Aviation Corps, namely, Lieutenants\r\nK. R. Van der Spuy, E. C. Emmett, and G. S. Creed, were at once\r\nincorporated in Nos. 2, 3, and 5 Squadrons respectively. Two others,\r\nCaptain G. P. Wallace and Lieutenant B. H. Turner, joined No. 4 Squadron\r\nin the field early in September. Later on, both groups of officers were\r\nused for operations in distant theatres. When in November 1914 the Turks\r\nwere preparing to attack the Suez canal, a flight, consisting of Captain\r\nMassy, Captain Reilly, and Lieutenant S. P. Cockerell, with three\r\nMaurice Farman machines, left England to give to the forces in Egypt the\r\nindispensable aerial support. This small flight was the beginning of the\r\nMiddle East Brigade, which, under the command of Major-General W. G. H.\r\nSalmond, played so great a part in the campaigns of Mesopotamia and\r\nPalestine. Again, when in November 1914 the Union Government of South\r\nAfrica undertook to invade German South-West Africa, the officers of the\r\nSouth African Aviation Corps were recalled from their squadrons in\r\nFrance to provide the needed air force. When that campaign was ended,\r\nthese officers returned to England to form No. 26 Squadron of the Royal\r\nFlying Corps, which was immediately dispatched to East Africa, and\r\nco-operated with the forces under the command of General Smuts.\r\n\r\nThis rapid summary may serve to show how Farnborough, at the outbreak of\r\nwar, was a generating centre for the air forces of the British Empire,\r\nand how, until the Germans were held in France, all other purposes had\r\nto be postponed.\r\n\r\nOfficial returns show that with the four squadrons there went to France\r\n105 officers, 755 other ranks, 63 aeroplanes, and 95 mechanical\r\ntransport vehicles. At home there remained 41 officers, 116 aeroplanes,\r\nand 23 mechanical transport vehicles. But these latter figures are\r\nmisleading. All the experienced officers at home were fully employed on\r\nnecessary work, and the hundred and sixteen aeroplanes were impressive\r\nonly by their number. About twenty of them, more or less old-fashioned,\r\nwere in use at the Central Flying School for purposes of training; the\r\nrest were worn out or broken, and were fit only for the scrap-heap. By\r\nthe time that the war was a month old, the efficiency of the machines\r\nwhich had gone abroad was threatened by the progress of events at the\r\nfront. The B.E. 2, which was generally reckoned the best of these\r\nmachines, had been designed for the purposes of reconnaissance; it had a\r\nfair degree of stability, and gave the observer a clear view around him\r\nand beneath him. So long as it was not interfered with in the air it was\r\nan admirable machine for the reconnoitring of enemy dispositions and\r\nmovements. But the process of interference had begun. During the months\r\nof October and November fighting in the air became fairly frequent. This\r\nfighting had been foreseen, but only as a speculative possibility.\r\nMajor-General Seely, speaking on the Air Estimates for 1919-20, told the\r\nHouse of Commons that he had witnessed the first air combat in France,\r\none of those referred to in Sir John French's first dispatch, and that\r\nSir David Henderson had said to him: 'This is the beginning of a fight\r\nwhich will ultimately end in great battles in the air, in which\r\nhundreds, and possibly thousands, of men may be engaged at heights\r\nvarying from 10,000 to 20,000 feet.'\r\n\r\nA call for fighting machines soon followed these early combats. On the\r\n4th of September 1914 General Henderson wired home: 'There are no\r\naeroplanes with the Royal Flying Corps really suitable for carrying\r\nmachine-guns; grenades and bombs are therefore at present most suitable.\r\nIf suitable aeroplanes are available, machines-guns are better\r\nundoubtedly. Request you to endeavour to supply efficient fighting\r\nmachines as soon as possible.' A day or two earlier a request had been\r\nsent home for nine aeroplanes to replace losses, and for a complete new\r\nset of reserve aeroplanes for the Aircraft Park.\r\n\r\nWar is the only adequate training for war, and it was the necessities of\r\nthe war which revealed the needs of the Flying Corps, and gradually, by\r\nhard-won experience, determined the best types of aeroplane and the best\r\nkinds of armament. The enemy, driving with all his might for speedy\r\nvictory, allowed no holiday for research and manufacture. What hope was\r\nthere that the handful of officers in charge of the few centres of\r\nmilitary aeronautics in England would be able to meet the growing needs\r\nof the campaign in France? The outbreak of war found this country\r\npractically without an aeroplane engine industry. The few British firms\r\nwho understood anything about aeroplane manufacture had in time of peace\r\nreceived only small experimental orders, and so were not organized for\r\nrapid production. The situation might well be called desperate. How\r\ncould trained pilots, and machines fit to hold their own in the air, be\r\nproduced in sufficient numbers to secure for us not the mastery of the\r\nair--that was too distant a goal--but the power to keep the air, and to\r\ngive much-needed assistance to the British army in France?\r\n\r\nNo one knows what he can do until he tries. If the situation was\r\ndesperate, it was also familiar. The English temper is at its best in\r\ndesperate situations. The little old army held the pass in France and\r\nFlanders against enormous odds, and so procured time for the building up\r\nof the New Army, the instrument of victory. The Royal Flying Corps, a\r\nsmall body of highly trained men, kept the air in France, alongside of\r\nthe splendid French air service, while a new and greater air force was\r\nbrought to birth at home. The creation of this new force was of a piece\r\nwith that wonder of the war--the creation of the New Army. In some ways\r\nit was the most difficult part of that great achievement. The new\r\ninfantry battalions were made largely by the imitation of a magnificent\r\nmodel and the repetition of methods proved by many past successes. The\r\nmen who brought the Flying Corps to an unexpected strength had to\r\nexplore untried ways; the problems presented to them were complicated\r\nand novel; they had no safe models to copy, and no ancient tradition to\r\nfollow. They had to cope patiently and resolutely with the most recent\r\nof sciences, and, more than that, they had to procure and train a body\r\nof men who should transform the timid and gradual science into a\r\nconfident and rapid art. The engine is the heart of an aeroplane, but\r\nthe pilot is its soul. They succeeded so well that at the opening of the\r\nbattles of the Somme, on the 1st of July 1916, the Royal Flying Corps\r\nheld the mastery of the air, that is to say, they held a predominant\r\nposition in the air, and were able to impose their will upon the enemy.\r\nAt the date of the armistice, the 11th of November 1918, the united\r\nRoyal Air Force was incomparably the strongest air force in the world.\r\nMost of the pilots and observers who were flying at that time are now\r\nscattered in civil employ, but they will never forget the pride of their\r\nold allegiance nor the perils and raptures of their old life in the air.\r\n\r\nIt is the business of this history to tell of their doings. But before\r\nrecording the appearance at the front of squadron after squadron, it is\r\nessential to tell something of the making of these squadrons. The whole\r\nelaborate system which was the basis of the Royal Air Force, the\r\nproduction of machines and armament and the training of men, was devised\r\nand put in action during the first year of the war. It was elastic in\r\ncharacter, and was capable of great expansion, but its main outlines\r\nwere never changed, even when the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval\r\nAir Service, after a divorce of four years, were reunited in 1918.\r\nEnglishmen are much in the habit of decrying their own achievements.\r\nThis they do, not from modesty, but from a kind of inverted pride. Even\r\na fair measure of success seems to them a little thing when it is\r\ncompared with their own estimate of their abilities. Before the war the\r\nGerman power of organization was tediously praised in England, and our\r\nown incapacity for organization was tediously censured. There is truth\r\nin the contrast; the Germans love organization and pattern in human\r\nsociety, both for their own sake and for the rest and support that they\r\ngive to the individual. The British hate elaborate organization, and are\r\nwilling to accept it only when it is seen to be necessary for achieving\r\na highly desired end. With the Germans, the individual is the servant of\r\nthe society; with us, the society is the servant of the individual, and\r\nis judged by its success, not only in promoting his material welfare,\r\nbut in enhancing his opportunities and giving free play to his\r\ncharacter. We do not readily organize ourselves except under the spur of\r\nimmediate necessity. But those of us who are honest and frank will never\r\nagain say that we cannot organize ourselves. The making of our air force\r\nwas a masterpiece of organization. The men who achieved it have earned a\r\nplace in the memory of their country.\r\n\r\nWhen military aviation had outgrown its early pupilage to the Royal\r\nEngineers it came under the immediate control of the War Office. It was\r\ndealt with at first by the small committee, under Brigadier-General\r\nHenderson, which had prepared the plans for the formation of the Flying\r\nCorps, and which was continued in being after the Flying Corps was\r\nformed. In November 1912 Captain E. L. Ellington, of the Royal\r\nArtillery, succeeded Major MacInnes as secretary to this committee; in\r\nJune 1913 the committee was dissolved, and its work was taken over by a\r\nnewly formed section of the Military Training Directorate, with Captain\r\nEllington in charge. A little later, on the 1st of September 1913, a\r\nMilitary Aeronautics Directorate was established in the War Office, and\r\nat once took charge of the military air service. It was independent of\r\nthe four great departments of the War Office, and the Director-General\r\nof Military Aeronautics dealt in person with the Secretary of State for\r\nWar. There were three sections or branches (officially called\r\nsubdivisions) of the directorate. The first of these was responsible for\r\ngeneral policy, administration, and training. The second was responsible\r\nfor equipment--the provision and inspection of material. The third had\r\ncharge of contracts. It was a new departure to place a contracts branch\r\nunder the control of a military director-general, but aviation is a\r\nhighly technical business, and the arranging of contracts for aircraft\r\nand air engines could not be profitably separated from the other aspects\r\nof the work. In immediate touch with the directorate, and completing the\r\noriginal organization of military aeronautics, there were the Central\r\nFlying School at Upavon, the Military Wing of the Royal Flying Corps\r\nwith its eight authorized squadrons, the Royal Aircraft Factory, and the\r\nAeronautical Inspection Department.\r\n\r\nIn July 1914 Brigadier-General Sir David Henderson was Director-General\r\nof Military Aeronautics; Captain Godfrey Paine, R.N., was Commandant of\r\nthe Central Flying School; and Lieutenant-Colonel F. H. Sykes was the\r\nOfficer Commanding the Military Wing. When the war broke out Sir David\r\nHenderson was appointed to command the Royal Flying Corps in the field,\r\nwith Lieutenant-Colonel F. H. Sykes as his Chief of Staff.\r\n\r\nThus, at a time when rapid development was essential if we were to hold\r\nthe air, the two most important officers, who had nursed the Flying\r\nCorps from its infancy, were called away to more urgent service. General\r\nHenderson still held his directorship of military aviation. If he\r\nthought the war likely to be short, he was not alone in that belief.\r\nMajor Burke's squadron, when they left their quarters at Montrose,\r\nfastened up the doors of their rooms with sealing-wax and tape, and\r\naffixed written instructions that nothing was to be disturbed during\r\ntheir absence. Meantime, the duties of the directorate and of the home\r\ncommand of the Flying Corps had to be carried on, at high pressure, in\r\nthe face of enormous difficulties. The practical work of the directorate\r\nwas undertaken by the little group of staff officers who were familiar\r\nwith it, and especially by Major W. S. Brancker, who, on the outbreak of\r\nwar, was appointed an Assistant Director of Military Aeronautics, and\r\nsoon after became Deputy Director. The command of the Military Wing at\r\nFarnborough was given to Major Hugh Montague Trenchard, and the Royal\r\nFlying Corps had found its destined Chief.\r\n\r\n'We should be modest for a modest man,' Charles Lamb somewhere remarks,\r\n'as he is for himself.' But this is no personal question. What is said\r\nof General Trenchard is said of the Flying Corps. The power which Nature\r\nmade his own, and which attends him like his shadow, is the power given\r\nhim by his singleness of purpose and his faith in the men whom he\r\ncommands. He has never called on them to do anything that he would not\r\ndo himself, if he were not very unfortunately condemned, as he once told\r\nthe pilots of a squadron, to go about in a Rolls-Royce car and to sit in\r\na comfortable chair. He has never thought any deed of sacrifice and\r\ndevotion too great for their powers. His faith in them was justified.\r\nSpeaking, in 1918, to a squadron of the Independent Force, newly brought\r\nto the neighbourhood of Nancy for the bombing of the munition factories\r\nof Germany, he reminded them that if sending them all at once across the\r\nlines, never to return, would shorten the war by a week, it would be his\r\nduty to send them. The pilots listened to him with pride. He had their\r\nconfidence, as they had his. 'Don't cramp the pilots into never\r\ntalking,' is one of his advices to commanders, and the system whereby\r\nthe pilots and observers, returning dazed and exhausted from a raid or a\r\nfight in the air, were brought to the office of the aerodrome and\r\nencouraged by sympathetic questions to tell what they had seen and done,\r\nwas a system which grew up at once under his command. His intuitive\r\nunderstanding of the men who served under him, his quickness in learning\r\nthe lessons of experience, and his resourcefulness and daring in\r\nimmediately applying these lessons for the bettering of the Flying\r\nCorps, have been worth many brigades to his country. His name will occur\r\noften in this record, but here, at his first entry, he must be\r\nintroduced to the reader.\r\n\r\nHe was born in 1873, the son of Captain Montague Trenchard, of the\r\nKing's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry. He was educated privately, and\r\nafter several failures in examination entered the army by way of the\r\nmilitia, receiving his commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal\r\nScots Fusiliers. After some years in India he served in the South\r\nAfrican War, at first with the Imperial Yeomanry Bushman Corps, and\r\nlater with the Canadian Scouts. During the operations west of Pretoria,\r\nin the autumn of 1900, he was dangerously wounded, but served again,\r\nduring the concluding years of the war, with the mounted infantry in the\r\nTransvaal, the Orange River Colony, and the Cape Colony. There followed\r\na period of distinguished service in Nigeria, and then he was at home\r\nfor a time. In February 1912, three months before the Royal Flying Corps\r\ncame into being, he applied for employment with the mounted branch of\r\nthe Colonial Defence Forces, in Australia, or New Zealand, or South\r\nAfrica. In May he applied for employment with the Macedonian\r\nGendarmerie. These applications were noted for consideration at the War\r\nOffice; in the meantime his mind turned to the newly-formed Flying\r\nCorps. Mr. T. O. M. Sopwith tells the story of how he learned to fly.\r\n\r\n'Major Trenchard (as he was then) arrived at my School at Brooklands\r\none morning in August 1912. He told me that the War Office had given him\r\nten days in which to learn to fly and pass his tests for an aviator's\r\ncertificate, adding that if he could not pass by that date he would be\r\nover age. It was no easy performance to undertake, but Major Trenchard\r\ntackled it with a wonderful spirit. He was out at dawn every morning,\r\nand only too keen to do anything to expedite tuition. He passed in about\r\none week from first going into the air as a passenger. He was a model\r\npupil from whom many younger men should have taken a lead.'\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of August 1912 he took his certificate, flying a Farman\r\nmachine. Then he went to the Central Flying School, where he took the\r\nnecessary courses and passed the necessary examination. On the 1st of\r\nOctober he was appointed instructor on the staff of the school. These\r\nwere arduous times; an efficient British air force was yet to make, and\r\nthe political horizon was even more threatening than it was a year\r\nlater. He continued at this work till the 23rd of September 1913, when\r\nhe was appointed assistant commandant to Captain Godfrey Paine, a post\r\nwhich he held up to the outbreak of war. By that time a very large\r\nproportion of the officers of the Flying Corps had passed through his\r\nhands. His policy was the policy of Thorough. He played his part in\r\nproducing the efficiency of the original Flying Corps.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of August 1914 he was appointed Officer Commanding the Royal\r\nFlying Corps (Military Wing), with the temporary rank of\r\nlieutenant-colonel. The headquarters, the aircraft park, and the four\r\nsquadrons left for France at once. Mr. G. B. Cockburn at that time was\r\nat Farnborough, where, from April onwards, he had held an appointment in\r\nthe Aeronautical Inspection Department. He has kindly contributed a\r\nnote:\r\n\r\n'The squadrons hurried off to the front,' he says, and in a short time\r\nthere remained practically nothing in the way of machines or pilots in\r\nthe country. Colonel Trenchard took charge to create something out of\r\nnothing. His presence at Farnborough had a most enlivening effect on\r\nevery one who came in touch with him, and as I had to pass through to\r\nhim all the machines issued in those days, it was my good fortune to\r\nhave very close observation of those methods which have led to his great\r\nsuccess.'\r\n\r\nIn his attempt to create something out of nothing he had the\r\nwhole-hearted support and help of the small but admirably efficient\r\naeronautical department of the War Office, directed for the time by\r\nColonel Brancker. One great strength of military aviation in its early\r\ndays was that it attracted into its service, by natural magnetism, men\r\nof an adventurous disposition. The dangers of the Flying Corps, rather\r\nthan the good pay that it offered, brought to it recruits strong in all\r\nthe virtues of the pioneer. No one who covets a life of routine, with\r\ndefined duties and limited liabilities, ever yet took up with aviation\r\nas a profession. The men who explored and took possession of the air in\r\nthe twentieth century are the inheritors of the men who explored and\r\ntook possession of America in the sixteenth century. It is one of our\r\nchief title-deeds as a nation that adventurers are very numerous among\r\nus. We were not the first to show the way, in either case, but because\r\nwe are a breeding-ground of adventurers we are richer than other nations\r\nin the required type of character, and we soon outgo them. When the war\r\ncame there was a long list of officers and men who were seeking\r\nadmission to the Flying Corps--the best of them as good as could be\r\nfound in the world. The very staff of the directorate at the War Office\r\nhad the same quality. They were men of spirit and initiative, not\r\neasily to be bound by red tape. A short account of Colonel Brancker, who\r\nwas Colonel Trenchard's main support, will illustrate this special good\r\nfortune of the Flying Corps.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Sir William Sefton Brancker, as he now is, began his\r\nsoldiering in the Royal Artillery. He saw much active service in the\r\nSouth African War, and thereafter was chosen for staff service in India.\r\nHis opportunity came in the winter of 1910. In that year the British and\r\nColonial Aeroplane Company, in order to demonstrate the new art to the\r\nGeneral Staff in India, sent out to Calcutta an expedition consisting of\r\na manager, the French pilot Monsieur H. Jullerot, two British mechanics,\r\nand three Bristol box-kites fitted with 50 horse-power Gnome engines.\r\nCaptain Brancker, as Quartermaster-General of the Presidency Brigade,\r\nwas responsible for the disembarkation of the party. What he had already\r\nheard of flying had excited his keen interest; he attached himself\r\nfirmly to the expedition, and was permitted to fly, unofficially, in the\r\ncharacter of observer. The first aeroplane was erected on the Calcutta\r\nracecourse, and flew in the presence of a huge crowd of spectators.\r\n\r\nThere were cavalry manoeuvres that year in the Deccan, and General\r\nRimington, who was organizing them, set aside a part of his manoeuvre\r\ngrant to enable Captain Brancker to bring an aeroplane and take part in\r\nthem. The aeroplane arrived at Aurangabad early in January 1911, and was\r\nhastily erected under a tree by the two mechanics, assisted by six\r\nwilling and jocular privates of the Dublin Fusiliers. It was ready\r\nforty-eight hours after detrainment, just in the nick of time. The first\r\nflight was made by M. Jullerot and Captain Brancker, the day before the\r\nmanoeuvres began, in the presence of twelve generals, one of whom was\r\nSir Douglas Haig, at that time Chief of the Staff in India, and a\r\nnumerous company of staff officers. Next morning the aeroplane was\r\nattached to the northern force at Aurangabad, whose task was to drive\r\nback the rearguard of a southern force retreating towards Jalna. Captain\r\nBrancker and M. Jullerot made a flight of about twenty-seven miles at a\r\nheight of 1,100 feet, and the hostile rearguard was accurately located.\r\nA full report was in the hands of the commander of the northern force in\r\nless than an hour and a half from the time of his demand for\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nSubsequent flights were less successful; indeed, the next morning the\r\naeroplane crashed from a height of a hundred feet; the two aviators\r\nescaped with a few scratches, but the machine was reduced to matchwood.\r\nNevertheless, the first thorough performance by a military aeroplane of\r\na really practical military mission deeply impressed General Sir O'Moore\r\nCreagh, the then Commander-in-Chief, and, had it not been for lack of\r\nmoney, he would have started a flying organization in India a year\r\nbefore the Flying Corps in England came into being.\r\n\r\nNot long after his return to England, Major Brancker was employed at the\r\nWar Office under General Henderson. As soon as the opportunity presented\r\nitself, he learned to fly. He took the short course at the Central\r\nFlying School and was appointed to the Royal Flying Corps Reserve. In\r\nOctober 1913 he succeeded Captain Ellington on the staff of the Military\r\nAeronautics Directorate. He continued to fly. The first really stable\r\naeroplane, the B.E. 2c, was produced in June 1914; and Major Brancker,\r\nwho describes himself as 'a very moderate pilot', flew the first of the\r\ntype from Farnborough to Upavon, without the use of his hands except to\r\nthrottle back the engine before alighting; during the flight he wrote a\r\nfull reconnaissance report.\r\n\r\nThese then, Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard and Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nBrancker, were the two officers on whom fell the chief burden of\r\nresponsibility at home for the maintenance and increase of the Flying\r\nCorps. Others gave invaluable help; but these were the prime movers. The\r\nmaintenance of the squadrons in the field, that is, the replacing of\r\nwastage in pilots and machines, was all that was originally expected of\r\nthem by the command of the Royal Flying Corps in France. When, just\r\nafter the outbreak of war, Lord Kitchener took control of the War\r\nOffice, the creation of new squadrons at once became a question of the\r\nfirst importance. Lord Kitchener has many titles to the gratitude of his\r\ncountry, none of them stronger than this, that he recognized the\r\nimmensity of the war. The day after the four squadrons took their\r\ndeparture for France he sent for Lieutenant-Colonel Brancker in the War\r\nOffice, explained to him his policy for the creation of the New Army,\r\nand told him that a large number of new squadrons would be required to\r\nequip that army.\r\n\r\nThe position was serious. Farnborough was now the only station occupied\r\nby the Royal Flying Corps; it had an assemblage of half-trained and\r\ninefficient pilots, and a collection of inferior aeroplanes, discarded\r\nas useless by the squadrons which had gone overseas. The Central Flying\r\nSchool itself had been heavily depleted. There was a grave shortage of\r\nmechanics. But the officers in charge were not to be disheartened; and\r\nthey had one advantage, without which the most complete material\r\npreparation would have been of no avail--they had the nation behind\r\nthem. The invasion of Belgium by German troops during the first few\r\nweeks of war, and the ordered cruelties inflicted by those troops on a\r\nhelpless population, set England on fire; never since the old war with\r\nSpain had the fervour of national indignation reached so white a heat.\r\nExcept the unfit and the eccentric, it might almost be said, there were\r\nno civilians left; the nation made the war its own, and miracles of\r\nrecruiting and training became the order of every day.\r\n\r\nThe Directorate of Military Aeronautics took the bull by the horns;\r\nwithout Treasury sanction, on their own initiative, they began to enlist\r\ncivilian mechanics at the rates authorized for the Army Service Corps,\r\nup to 10_s._ a day. In a very few days they had got together eleven\r\nhundred good men, trained mechanics, who eventually became the main\r\nsupport of the squadrons which were created during the next two years.\r\nThey also enlisted some civilian pilots. It was their intention to grade\r\nthese pilots as non-commissioned officers, but the Admiralty meantime\r\ndecided to give commissions to all pilots recruited from the civil\r\npopulation, which decision forced the hand of the military. Thus, in the\r\nfirst few days of the war, the question of the rank of pilots was\r\nsettled at a blow, and it was not until much later in the war that\r\nnon-commissioned officers were again employed as pilots.\r\n\r\nA definite scheme for the steady recruitment of expert mechanics, so\r\nmany a month, at peace rates of pay, was then laid down by the\r\ndirectorate. Naturally, at the beginning, large numbers could not be\r\nabsorbed, and as there was no system of control to allot recruits to the\r\nwork for which they were specially suited, very many of the best\r\nmechanics in the country, inspired by patriotism, enlisted in the ranks\r\nof the infantry, and were lost to the technical service for ever. These\r\nmen would have been of inestimable value for the expansion of the Flying\r\nCorps, but no system of classification existed, to meet the needs of a\r\nnation in arms. The New Army engulfed men of all professions and all\r\ncrafts; never, perhaps, in the world's history was there an army richer\r\nin diversity of skill. If special services were required from a\r\nbacteriologist, or a conjurer, an appeal to the rank and file of the\r\nNew Army was seldom made in vain. Trained mechanics were glad to forgo\r\nall the advantages of their training, and, in their country's cause, to\r\nhandle a rifle and a bayonet.\r\n\r\nThe procuring of a sufficient number of expert men for the sheds was\r\nonly one part of the business of the directorate. They had also to\r\nprocure and train a large number of pilots, and to arrange for the\r\nsupply of a very large number of aeroplanes and engines. Until the\r\nmachine is there, to be tended and flown, there is nothing for pilot or\r\nmechanic to do, so the question of the machines naturally came first. As\r\nsoon as the four squadrons of the expeditionary force had left England,\r\nColonel Brancker conferred with Captain Sueter, the Director of the Air\r\nDepartment in the Admiralty. It was agreed between them provisionally\r\nthat all aeroplanes available in the British Isles should at once be\r\nallotted to the War Office, and all seaplanes to the Admiralty. It was\r\nfurther agreed that all engines of 100 horse-power and less, together\r\nwith the 120 horse-power Beardmore engine, should be allotted to the War\r\nOffice, and that engines of higher horse-power, together with a certain\r\nnumber, for training purposes, of lower-powered engines, should be\r\nallotted to the Admiralty. Both services recognized the urgent need for\r\na water-cooled engine of high power, and the two directors combined to\r\npersuade Messrs. Rolls-Royce to produce a 250 horse-power water-cooled\r\nengine. The experts of the Royal Aircraft Factory gave all possible\r\nhelp; they lent the drawings prepared for the high-powered engine\r\ndesigned by the factory, and so became sponsors for the famous\r\nRolls-Royce engines of the later days of the war. The output of the\r\nRolls-Royce works, in accordance with the agreement, was placed at the\r\ndisposal of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nThis immediate co-operation between the two great services did the work\r\nof the old Air Committee, which had quietly faded away. The War\r\nCommittee could not take its place; it was a large body of Ministers,\r\ntoo numerous to agree on special decisions, and not expert enough to\r\ndeal with the complicated problems of aviation. The understanding\r\nbetween the two services seemed to augur well for the future.\r\n\r\nThe available contractors and types of engine having been allotted, it\r\nbecame necessary to decide what orders should be placed. In this matter\r\nthe initiative rested with the directorate. Very little experience was\r\navailable as a guide to what the expeditionary force might require in\r\nthe future. Every order placed was practically a gamble, and every new\r\ntype of aircraft and engine gave the staff twofold cause for anxiety.\r\nWould the new machine prove reliable when the trade produced it, and, if\r\nit proved reliable, would it then fulfil the rapidly changing\r\nrequirements of the war? The quickest way to produce aeroplanes in\r\nquantity would have been to choose a few of the best types, and to\r\nstandardize these for production in bulk at all the available factories.\r\nTo do this would have been a fatal mistake. The art of military aviation\r\nwas changing and growing rapidly; any hard and fast system would have\r\nproved a huge barrier to progress, making it impossible to take\r\nadvantage of the lessons taught every week by experience in the field.\r\nAt a later stage of the war the Germans standardized their excellent\r\nMercedes engine. This gave them an immediate advantage, but, as\r\nknowledge increased and construction improved, what had been an\r\nadvantage became a brake upon their progress.\r\n\r\nEven the lessons of experience were not always easy to read. An\r\naeroplane and its engine are judged by the pilot who uses them. Every\r\none who knows the Royal Flying Corps knows how sensitive to rumour and\r\nhow contagious opinion is among pilots. This is only natural; a pilot\r\ntrusts his life to his machine, and his machine, if he is to fly and\r\nfight confidently, must be, like Caesar's wife, above suspicion. To\r\ndistrust the machine is to suffer a kind of paralysis in the air. The\r\nbreath of unfavourable rumour easily takes away the character of a\r\nmachine, and makes it, in effect, valueless. A pilot has one life, and\r\nhas to take many risks; this is the only risk that he will not take\r\ngladly. It follows that the opinion of pilots concerning their machines\r\nis peculiarly liable to error. They talk to one another, and an ill\r\nreport spreads like wildfire. When the Sopwith Tabloid was first\r\nproduced, it was unfavourably reported on by those who flew it, and at\r\nonce fell into disrepute throughout the squadrons. The fact is that the\r\npilots of that time were not good enough for the machine; if they had\r\nstuck to it, and learnt its ways, they would soon have sworn by it as,\r\nlater on in the war, they swore by the Sopwith Camel. A similar ill\r\nrepute attached itself, like an invisible label, to the De Havilland\r\nmachine called the D.H. 2. This machine, when it made its first\r\nappearance at the front, was nicknamed 'The Spinning Incinerator'. Like\r\nmany other machines which are quick to respond to control, the D.H. 2\r\nvery easily fell into a spin, and in one accident of this kind it had\r\ncaught fire. In February 1916, when the Fokker menace was at its height,\r\nNo. 24 Squadron--the first British squadron of single-seater fighting\r\nscouts--arrived in France. It was equipped with D.H. 2's, and the pilots\r\nof the Fokkers had no reason to think the D.H. 2 an inferior machine.\r\nThe historian of No. 24 Squadron says:\r\n\r\n'A certain amount of trouble was caused at first through the ease with\r\nwhich these machines used to \"spin\"--a manoeuvre not at that time\r\nunderstood--and several casualties resulted. Lieutenant Cowan did much\r\nto inspire confidence by the facility with which he handled his machine.\r\nHe was the first pilot really to \"stunt\" this machine, and gradually the\r\nsquadron gained complete assurance.'\r\n\r\nNerves are tense in war, and a mishap at the front usually led to an\r\nimmediate demand for new material or a new policy from those at home who\r\nsupplied the expeditionary force. Major-General Sir Sefton Brancker, in\r\nhis notes on the early part of the war, mentions three of these quick\r\ndemands. When the aeroplane piloted by Lieutenant Waterfall was brought\r\ndown by infantry fire in Belgium, this first mishap of the kind led to\r\nan immediate demand for armoured aeroplanes. The demand was not\r\nfulfilled until 1918, and then only in a special type of machine,\r\ndesigned for low flying. Again, the alarm of the 1st of September 1914,\r\nwhen the machines of the Flying Corps, being unable to fly by night, ran\r\nthe risk of capture by German cavalry, led to a demand for folding\r\naeroplanes suitable for towing along the road. This demand was never\r\nmet. Lastly, the rapid movement of the retreat caused a report to be\r\nsent home that the canvas sheds on wooden frameworks, called Bessoneaux\r\nhangars, were useless. With the coming of trench warfare more stable\r\nconditions prevailed, and Bessoneaux hangars housed the Royal Flying\r\nCorps in great comfort throughout the war.\r\n\r\nIncidents like these serve to show how great was the responsibility\r\nwhich rested on the home command. Fortunately, the home command were\r\ncool and far-sighted. Colonel Trenchard was the last man in the world to\r\nsubordinate life to mechanism; and Colonel Brancker knew how to fly\r\nwithout fidgeting with the controls.\r\n\r\nThe resources to hand were not many. A certain small number of\r\naeroplanes, in July 1914, were actually on order, and were being\r\nmanufactured in slow and uncertain fashion. These belonged to several\r\ntypes. The earlier variants of the B.E. 2 machine were of Government\r\ndesign. Of proprietary designs, on order or in process of delivery, the\r\nmost important at that time were the British Sopwith and Avro machines,\r\nand the French Maurice Farmans, Henri Farmans, and Bleriots, which were\r\nerected in England from parts supplied by France. Certain new types--the\r\nF.E. 2 (a pusher biplane), the R.E. 5 (a tractor two-seater bombing\r\nmachine), the S.E. 2 (a single-seater tractor scout), the Vickers\r\nfighter, the Bristol scout, and several others--were hardly past the\r\nexperimental stage. Some were in process of design; others were\r\nrepresented by a few experimental machines. In the matter of engines,\r\nthe factory was engaged in designing its own, and a few British\r\nproprietary designs had been tried, but without sufficient success to\r\nwarrant an order. In fact, the Royal Flying Corps had to depend entirely\r\non French engines, that is to say, on the 70 horse-power Renault and the\r\n80 horse-power Gnome. Large purchases of these engines were made during\r\nthe week before the declaration of war; indeed, the whole of the funds\r\navailable were spent twice over in anticipation of further credits.\r\n\r\nWhen the war came, Avros, Farmans, and Bleriots were ordered to the full\r\ncapacity of the factories that produced them. Vickers fighters were also\r\nordered in numbers, though the latest model of the machine was untried,\r\nand though there was no certainty that the necessary 100 horse-power\r\nMonosoupape-Gnome engine could be obtained, or that when obtained it\r\nwould run reliably. On the advice of the superintendent of the Royal\r\nAircraft Factory it was decided to choose B.E. 2c for production in bulk\r\nrather than the earlier variants of the same type. This involved some\r\nlittle delay, for the drawings were not complete, but the superiority of\r\nthe machine in construction, performance, and stability was judged to\r\nbe worth the delay. Some firms which had never before touched aviation\r\ntook large orders for this machine; the earliest to lend their services\r\nwere the Daimler Company and Weir Brothers of Glasgow. For fighting\r\npurposes the F.E. 2, a two-seater pusher, which gave a clear field of\r\nfire forward, was chosen, and the drawings were pushed on at top speed.\r\nSmaller orders were placed among private firms for untried types of\r\nsingle-seater fighters, especially the Bristol scout and the Martinsyde\r\nscout. Messrs. Armstrong Whitworth, on receiving orders for B.E. 2 c's,\r\nundertook to produce an equally efficient and more easily manufactured\r\naeroplane, and received permission to do so. Thus, before any definite\r\npolicy could be laid down, and while experience gained in the field was\r\nstill very small, the production of a large number of aircraft and air\r\nengines had been set on foot in England. Until the orders placed should\r\nbegin to bear fruit, the Farman pusher machines, which could mount a\r\nmachine-gun with a clear field of fire in front, were the only suitable\r\nfighting machines.\r\n\r\nThe enlisting and training of pilots, in numbers sufficient for the\r\ncreation of new squadrons when the wastage in the field had been made\r\ngood, was a matter of pressing concern. The only expert military pilots\r\navailable as instructors were those employed at the Central Flying\r\nSchool. These were reinforced, first by certain civilian pilots who at\r\nonce offered their services, and then, about the end of September, by\r\nthe return from France of Major Longcroft and some other military pilots\r\nwho in response to urgent requests were spared from the expeditionary\r\nforce. A reserve aeroplane squadron was at once formed at Farnborough,\r\nand a large training scheme was initiated. The aerodromes at Netheravon,\r\nGosport, Montrose, and Dover (this last still in process of making) were\r\nempty. Montrose, being far from London and from France, was handed over\r\nto the army; the others were made into training stations. Brooklands and\r\nHounslow were taken over, and, during September, Shoreham and Joyce\r\nGreen. New aerodromes were established at Norwich, Castle Bromwich,\r\nBeaulieu, Catterick, and Northolt. Each of these, it was decided, should\r\nbe occupied by a reserve squadron, which, besides the regular work of\r\ntraining pilots, should prepare to throw off an active service squadron.\r\nThe policy of distributing the new training stations all over England\r\nwas decided on for several reasons. The congestion and delay inevitable\r\nat a few crowded centres would be avoided. The complete arrest of\r\ntraining by bad weather in one place would be insured against. The\r\nscattered aerodromes would be useful halting-places for new machines\r\ndelivered by air; and, not least important, the New Army, training in\r\nvarious parts of England, would see something of aviation and would gain\r\nsome knowledge of its uses. The chief disadvantage of the system was\r\ntemporary; the available talent in instructors was scattered, so that a\r\nlarger number of instructors was required.\r\n\r\nIn all these arrangements Lord Kitchener took a keen and detailed\r\ninterest. He saw Colonel Brancker almost every day. He insisted on the\r\ncreation of new units as a matter of the first importance. He\r\ninvestigated the possibilities of long-range bombing offensives against\r\nGermany, and continually urged the development of aircraft with a fuel\r\nendurance and a carrying capacity sufficient for a raid upon Essen. For\r\nthis purpose he knew that trained and disciplined flights would be\r\nrequired, and he gave orders that formation flying was to be taught and\r\npractised at once. He did not fully understand the crippling effect of\r\nthe shortage of pilots and the inefficiency of the available aircraft.\r\nSoon after the outbreak of war he said to Colonel Trenchard:\r\n\r\n'Trenchard, when I come down to Farnborough I want to see machines\r\nflying in formation.'\r\n\r\n'But that is impossible,' said Colonel Trenchard. 'The machines are all\r\nof different types and different performances; we cannot fly in\r\nformation.'\r\n\r\n'Trenchard, when I come down to Farnborough I want to see machines\r\nflying in formation.'\r\n\r\n'But, Sir, it cannot be done.'\r\n\r\n'Trenchard, when I come down to Farnborough, you will have four machines\r\nparaded for me, to fly in formation.'\r\n\r\nLord Kitchener's foresight was unerring, and his will was strong, but\r\nthe facts were too stubborn even for him. It proved impossible to fly\r\nour machines in formation until about a year later. The first formation\r\nflying seen over England during the war occurred on the 23rd of February\r\n1915, when H.M.S. _Hearty_ reported seven German aeroplanes flying very\r\nhigh over the Maplin Lightship, just off the coast of Essex.\r\n\r\nThe value of Lord Kitchener's support was immense. In the early months\r\nof 1915 an order of battle for the New Army was produced, showing its\r\norganization in corps and divisions. Colonel Brancker, when he saw this\r\norder, reckoned that at the rate of one artillery reconnaissance\r\nsquadron for each division, and two or three fighting and reconnaissance\r\nsquadrons for each corps, at least fifty service squadrons would be\r\nrequired. This, while the system of training was not yet in full working\r\norder, and while the output of engines and aeroplanes was still so\r\nsmall, seemed a very ambitious programme. But the squadrons were needed,\r\nso a minute to that effect was circulated among the departments\r\nconcerned, who promptly added to it their remarks and comments, all\r\ncritical and sceptical. At last the paper reached the Secretary of State\r\nfor War, who, without an hour's delay, sent it straight back by hand to\r\nthe Deputy Director of Military Aeronautics, bearing an inscription\r\nscribbled at the foot--'Double this. K.' These two words, initialled,\r\nswept away all conservative and financial obstruction; from that time\r\nforward the main difficulty was to prevent the development of the\r\nsquadrons from running so far ahead of the output of material as to\r\nweaken the whole structure. The hundred squadrons took a long time to\r\nmake; but before the war ended a still more generous programme, with\r\nprovision for more than two hundred squadrons in the field, was in\r\nprocess of fulfilment.\r\n\r\nNo account can be given here of all the difficulties, problems, and\r\nmishaps which had to be faced, not only at Farnborough or in the War\r\nOffice, but at the stations all over the country, in the building up of\r\nthe squadrons. The building went on, and those who did their work on\r\nit--the civilian and mechanic volunteers, the novices who learned their\r\nbusiness only to teach it again to others, the men of special knowledge,\r\ntrained engineers, experts in wireless telegraphy, photography, and\r\ngunnery, who by their work on the ground contributed to the efficiency\r\nof the work to be done in the air--have a living monument in the\r\nexistence of the Royal Air Force. The material which lay ready to their\r\nhands was little in quantity, but some of it was very good, and served\r\nwell to set a standard. British aviation was a small and late\r\ndevelopment compared with the achievement of the French; but the skill\r\nand science of the Royal Aircraft Factory, and of the best of the\r\nprivate firms, had already given it a name for safety, quality, and\r\nperformance, and the zeal and character of its new recruits assured its\r\ncontinued increase and multiplied its merits. What was needed now was a\r\nplan for the building. Bricks and mortar, however good, and labour,\r\nhowever willing, are of no effect until they are disposed by the skill\r\nof the architect. It was the happiness of the Royal Flying Corps that\r\nthat skill was not lacking. Those who designed the work to be executed\r\nin human material were worthy of their opportunity. It is not always so.\r\nThere were many military misadventures in our history which give point\r\nto the criticism of the famous French cook, who, when he saw the beef\r\nand chickens of England, wept to think of the uses to which that\r\nmagnificent material would be put by the resolute monotony of British\r\ncooking.\r\n\r\nLong before the new squadrons were ready a plan had been made for using\r\nthem, and controlling them, to the best advantage. The command of the\r\nFlying Corps were very quick to learn and apply the lessons of\r\nexperience. These lessons, though not very many, were very important. By\r\nthe end of October 1914, all the squadrons of the Royal Flying Corps in\r\nthe field were settled down in the area of the British army, which held\r\na line running from Givenchy to Zonnebeke. The duties of the Flying\r\nCorps had thus become local in character, so that knowledge of the\r\nparticular piece of country over which they did their work now became\r\nvery important for pilots and observers. To enable the several army\r\ncorps and divisions to obtain full value from the services of the Flying\r\nCorps it was necessary that the squadrons should be put into touch\r\ndirectly with the corps commanders. A central command cannot judge the\r\nnecessities of the case as those on the spot can judge it; and much time\r\nis lost in sending messages to and fro. Corps commanders were already\r\ncalling for squadrons to be put at their disposal for observation and\r\nphotography. A scheme was worked out whereby squadrons were arranged in\r\ngroups of from two to four squadrons, each group being called a wing.\r\nThe scheme was accepted by the command of the expeditionary force, and\r\ncame into operation in November 1914. Already the new arrangement had\r\nbeen anticipated in practice. During the battles of Ypres in 1914, it\r\nhad been found necessary to detach squadrons, instead of flights, to\r\nco-operate with the several army corps; and these squadrons, instead of\r\nreturning at night to the central landing-place at the Flying Corps\r\nheadquarters, as they did during the battles of the Marne and the Aisne,\r\nremained permanently with the army corps which they were helping. The\r\nnew scheme regularized and extended this practice.\r\n\r\nThe creation of wings involved some transfers and promotions. The First\r\nWing, intended to operate with the Indian Corps and the Fourth Army\r\nCorps, consisted of Squadrons Nos. 2 and 3; the command was given to\r\nLieutenant-Colonel H. M. Trenchard, who came to St.-Omer on the 18th of\r\nNovember. The Second Wing, intended to operate with the Second and Third\r\nArmy Corps, consisted of Squadrons Nos. 5 and 6, and was commanded by\r\nLieutenant-Colonel C. J. Burke.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 Squadron and the wireless unit (afterwards No. 9 Squadron) were\r\nkept under the direct control of the Royal Flying Corps headquarters.\r\nShortly before the battle of Neuve-Chapelle the Third Wing was formed\r\nunder Lieutenant-Colonel H. R. M. Brooke-Popham, and No. 9 Squadron was\r\ndispersed amongst the other squadrons. What had been the Military Wing\r\nat Farnborough was now decentralized into two separate commands--the\r\nAdministrative Wing and the Fourth Wing--each controlled directly by the\r\nWar Office. The Administrative Wing, with headquarters at Farnborough,\r\nconsisting of Nos. 1 and 2 Reserve Aeroplane Squadrons, the Depot, the\r\nAircraft Park, and the Record Office, was placed under the command of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel E. B. Ashmore, who was transferred from the staff of\r\nthe General Officer Commanding the Home Forces. The Fourth Wing, with\r\nheadquarters at Netheravon, was placed under the command of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel J. F. A. Higgins, who had commanded No. 5 Squadron in\r\nFrance, and had been wounded, on the 30th of October, in the air above\r\nBailleul. This wing consisted of Nos. 1 and 7 Squadrons, preparing for\r\nservice in France.\r\n\r\nThe institution of wings was a great step in advance, and made it easy\r\nto provide for later additions to the strength of the Flying Corps. When\r\nthe newly-formed squadrons began to appear in number, they were formed\r\ninto wings, and the wings themselves, in the winter of 1915-16, were\r\ncombined in pairs to form brigades. The brigade became a self-sufficient\r\nunit, to work with an army; it was commanded by a brigadier-general, and\r\ncomprised, besides the two aeroplane wings, a third wing for kite\r\nballoons, an aircraft park, and everything necessary for a complete\r\naerial force. Further, when fighting in the air became all-important,\r\nwhole wings were made up of fighting squadrons, and these wings were\r\nsymmetrically paired with other wings made up of squadrons designed for\r\nartillery co-operation, close reconnaissance, and photography. The wing\r\nwhich carried out long reconnaissances and offensive patrols, bombing\r\nthe enemy, attacking him in the air, and, in effect, protecting the\r\nmachines which did their observation work above the lines, was called\r\nthe army wing, and worked for army headquarters. The wing which observed\r\nand photographed for the corps command, reporting on the character of\r\nthe enemy defences, the movement of troops, and, above all, the effects\r\nof our artillery fire, was called the corps wing, and worked for corps\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nThis powerful organization of the later years of the war was achieved by\r\na natural and easy expansion of the system of wings. In the early days\r\nof the war machines of various types were included in one squadron; then\r\nuniform squadrons of various types were included in one wing; at last,\r\nwings of various types were included in one brigade. The Flying Corps\r\ngrew and increased in close correspondence with the army to which it\r\nlent essential aid. The institution of wings was a formal recognition of\r\nthe necessity of its services. This recognition had taken some little\r\ntime to achieve. Military aviation was a wholly new thing, quite\r\nunfamiliar to many an old soldier. There was a certain shyness at first\r\nbetween the army and the Flying Corps. The command of the army did not\r\nalways ask for help from the air, and the command of the Flying Corps\r\ndid not always offer it. When the squadrons got into touch with the\r\ncorps commands, and did work for the artillery and the infantry, their\r\nvalue was proved beyond a doubt.\r\n\r\nThe commanding officer of a wing was given the rank of\r\nlieutenant-colonel. To assist him he had an adjutant and an equipment\r\nofficer. The introduction of equipment officers into the Royal Flying\r\nCorps involved a new departure. Up to this time the rule had been that\r\nall officers in the Flying Corps, whether employed on the ground or in\r\nthe air, must learn to fly. But to apply this rule, in time of war, to\r\nofficers whose duties would never take them off the ground, and who\r\nwould have to learn at schools already more than fully occupied with\r\ntraining pilots, seemed a waste of energy. There were, for instance,\r\nmany trained engineers, in civil life, who were eminently capable of\r\nsupervising the mechanical equipment, but who did not want to learn to\r\nfly, and could be made into indifferent pilots only at a great expense\r\nof time and labour, and at not a little risk. At first the equipment\r\nofficer was concerned only with stores, but soon the same grading was\r\ngiven to specialist officers concerned with wireless telegraphy,\r\nphotography, or machine-guns. At a later time in the war some senior\r\nofficers, skilled in the handling of men, learned to fly, and were at\r\nonce given the command of squadrons. A man with a talent for command,\r\nwho can teach and maintain discipline, encourage his subordinates, and\r\norganize the work to be done, will have a good squadron, and is free\r\nfrom those insidious temptations which so easily beset commanding\r\nofficers who have earned distinction as pilots. Yet the instinct of the\r\nRoyal Air Force is strong--that a commanding officer should know the\r\nair, if he is to control aircraft. The right solution, no doubt, is that\r\nhe should be able to fly well, and should be careful not to fly too\r\nmuch. A born commander who cannot fly is likely to have a better\r\nsquadron than a born flyer who cannot command.\r\n\r\nTechnical matters, that is to say, all matters of design and equipment,\r\nwere controlled by the War Office. This cast a great responsibility on\r\nthe War Office, and might have worked unhappily, if the authorities at\r\nhome had concentrated their attention on mechanical improvements without\r\nsufficient regard to the men who had to use them. But the two officers\r\nwho, in the beginning, were chiefly responsible for development at home\r\nsubsequently held commands in the field, so that theory was not divorced\r\nfrom practice. Colonel Trenchard was the first officer in the Royal\r\nFlying Corps to command a wing, and Colonel Brancker, at a later time,\r\nfrom August to December, 1915, was given the command of the Third Wing\r\nin France.\r\n\r\nThe whole development and expansion of the Royal Flying Corps in France\r\nwas carried on while the conditions were altering every month, at high\r\npressure, in rivalry with the Germans. It was a race to obtain machines\r\nof the greatest possible speed consistent with reliability. But no\r\nmachine is reliable when it is first turned out. Only experience can\r\nprove a mechanism, discover its faults, and teach the right method of\r\nhandling it. This experience had to be gained in war. The conditions of\r\nsuccess were never at a stay. As soon as a machine was tried and proved,\r\nand the faults of its engine corrected, so that it became comparatively\r\nreliable, a faster German machine appeared. This had a depressing effect\r\non the pilot, who, though he had been well satisfied with his own\r\nmachine, could find no words too bad for it when a German machine left\r\nhim standing in the air. After a time a new British machine would\r\nappear, and in its turn would outgo the German. In the meantime the\r\nimportant thing was to maintain the spirit of the pilot. It was the\r\nwisdom of General Trenchard to know that our success depended upon this.\r\nIn his own words, he sacrificed everything to morale. To think only of\r\ndangers and drawbacks, to make much of the points in which the Germans\r\nhad attained a fleeting superiority, to lay stress on the imperfections\r\nof our own equipment--all this, he knew, was to invite defeat. Just\r\nbefore the battles of the Somme, in 1916, a lively agitation of these\r\nmatters was carried on by the newspaper press in England. Major Maurice\r\nBaring, in his published diary, has recorded that the results of this\r\nagitation were--not the hastening of one bolt, turnbuckle, or split-pin\r\n(for the factories were fully at work), but a real danger of the spread\r\nof alarm and despondency among the younger members of the Flying Corps\r\nin France. More than any other man, General Trenchard averted this\r\ndanger. He put confidence into the pilots. He knew that if their hearts\r\nwere not light they would do worse than die; and he fostered in them, by\r\nsympathy, the feelings which make for life and are life. Inferiority in\r\nengines and machines could be remedied in time, inferiority in\r\nresolution and confidence would have been irremediable.\r\n\r\nAmong the points which were early brought home by the experience of the\r\nwar to those who had control of the production of machines, one or two\r\ndeserve special mention. The absolute necessity for an efficient\r\nfighting aeroplane was realized, it has been seen, within a month. The\r\nenormous value of artillery observation and the immense superiority of\r\nwireless telegraphy over all earlier and more rudimentary kinds of\r\nsignalling were soon demonstrated, and the call for machines fitted with\r\nwireless became insistent. Some of the pilots and some of the equipment\r\nof the wireless section which existed before mobilization had been used\r\nto bring the squadrons of the expeditionary force up to war strength.\r\nThe section, though much emaciated, was not allowed to lapse; it was\r\nattached to No. 4 Squadron, and went out with it to France. The pilots\r\nof this section, Lieutenants Lewis, James, and Winfield Smith, worked\r\nwith the squadron, but spent most of their time in making ready the\r\nwireless telegraphy equipment which, when once the retreat was ended and\r\nground stations were established on a fixed front, came into effective\r\nuse. Again, the very rapid development of an efficient German\r\nanti-aircraft service, and the equally rapid improvement in range and\r\naccuracy of anti-aircraft guns, changed the conditions of\r\nreconnaissance. In the almost pastoral simplicity of the first days of\r\nthe war, four thousand feet was held to be a sufficient height for\r\nimmunity from the effect of fire from the ground. Before long four times\r\nthat height gave no such immunity. Machines, therefore, had to be built\r\nto climb quickly, and had to be given a higher 'ceiling', as it is\r\ncalled; that is, they had to be able to maintain level flight in a more\r\nrarefied medium. But observation with the human eye from a height of\r\nseveral miles is almost useless for the detective work of military\r\nreconnaissance. So it came about that the improvement of the enemy's\r\nanti-aircraft artillery gave a direct impulse to the improvement of our\r\naerial photography. A photograph, taken in a good light and enlarged,\r\nreveals many things invisible to the naked eye; a series of photographs\r\nreveals those changes in the appearance of the earth's surface which\r\nresult from the digging of new trenches or gun-positions and the making\r\nof new ammunition-dumps.\r\n\r\nImprovements in mechanical science, to be of any use in war, depend on\r\nthe skill and practice of those who use them. General Trenchard never\r\nforgot this. He thought first of the pilot, and then of the gadgets.\r\n'The good gun-mounting', he once said, 'is the mounting that the pilot\r\ncan work.' This was a thing essential to remember at a time when the\r\npilot got the best part of his training in the war itself. If he could\r\nnot work the gun-mounting, the gun-mounting would probably survive him.\r\nTo study the tastes and preferences of pilots, even when these tastes\r\nwere prejudices, was the only way to efficiency. At the beginning of\r\n1916 General Trenchard made it a rule to supply one experimental\r\nmachine, without standardized mountings, to every squadron of the Royal\r\nFlying Corps, so that the pilots might put their own ideas to the test\r\nof practice. They had had but little opportunity to test their own ideas\r\nin the course of their training at the Central Flying School or the\r\nother training stations. The great practical School of Research for\r\npilots was the war.\r\n\r\nDuring the first winter of the war, the training given at the Central\r\nFlying School and the other training stations was still very elementary\r\nin character. The main part of the pupil's business was to learn to fly\r\nwith safety, and when he could do this he was passed out to the\r\nsquadrons. Such a training would have been terribly inadequate a year or\r\ntwo later, when no one could hope to fly long without fighting. At the\r\ntraining station in Shawbury, during the winter of 1917-18, Lieutenant\r\nW. L. S. Keith-Jopp, who, after losing a hand in the war, continued to\r\nbe a capable pilot, was in the habit of teaching his pupils all the\r\nacrobatics of the air, and would urge them on with the motto--'Stunt, or\r\ndie.' Those who could not or would not learn to side-slip, to loop, to\r\nimitate a fall out of control, and to perform a dozen other gymnastic\r\nfeats in the air had little prospect of a long flying career in France.\r\nBut the first winter of the war was innocent of all these fighting\r\nmanoeuvres. Group Captain J. G. Hearson, who made acquaintance with the\r\nCentral Flying School at that time, has kindly contributed some notes on\r\nthe system then in vogue. The Central Flying School, he says, was the\r\nMecca of all who wished to learn to fly. For serviceable machines,\r\ncompetent instructors, and the material and knowledge necessary to turn\r\nout a finished pilot, it was believed to be better than any other\r\ntraining centre. Some of the instructors had seen active service in\r\nFrance, and all were veterans in aviation. Of the pupils a certain\r\nnumber were regular officers, army or navy, but the majority were\r\ncivilians of promise. The ambition of all was the same, to get into the\r\nair as quickly as possible, and to qualify for the coveted wings, which,\r\nonce obtained, assured their wearer of immediate service, either in\r\nFrance, or with a naval unit. There were lectures on engines,\r\naeroplanes, wireless telegraphy, meteorology, tactics, and organization.\r\nFlying was taught in four flights of service machines, two of them being\r\nmade up of various types of the B.E. machines, while the other two\r\nconsisted of Henri Farmans and Avros. The pupil was first taken up as a\r\npassenger, and the method of using the controls was demonstrated to\r\nhim. He was then allowed to attempt flight for himself, either on a\r\nmachine fitted with dual controls, or with the watchful instructor on\r\nthe pounce to save him from dangerous mistakes. If he prospered well,\r\nthe great day soon came, which, however carefully it may have been\r\nprepared for, is always a thrilling experience and a searching test of\r\nself-reliance, the day of the first solo flight, sometimes ending in a\r\ntoo violent or too timid landing--that is, in a crash or a pancake. The\r\ntraining was almost wholly directed to producing airworthiness in the\r\npupil. The various activities which had developed at the front, such as\r\nartillery observation, fighting, and bombing, had no counterpart as yet\r\nin the training establishment. Most of the pupils were eager to fly and\r\nto get to France; they endured workshop instruction as a necessary evil.\r\nMost of the instructors were unable to answer the questions of a pupil\r\ninterested in the science of aviation. They knew, and taught, that when\r\na machine is steeply banked the rudder and the elevator appear to\r\nexchange functions, so that the rudder directs the machine up or down\r\nand the elevator turns it to this side or that, but they could not\r\nalways explain the reason of this mystery. Nor could they explain why in\r\na fog or cloud the compass of an aeroplane is suddenly possessed of a\r\ndevil, and begins to spin around. But although they were not all well\r\nversed in technical knowledge and theory, they were all fit to teach the\r\nmost important lesson--the lesson of confidence, resource, and\r\ninitiative.\r\n\r\nThere was no special school for the systematic training of observers\r\nuntil the spring of 1918, when the school of aeronautics at Bath was\r\nformed with that purpose in view. During the greater part of the war the\r\ninstruction given to observers in the schools at home was occasional and\r\ndesultory. From 1916 onwards a certain number were sent to Brooklands\r\nto learn wireless telegraphy, and a certain number to the machine gun\r\nschool at Hythe to learn aerial gunnery. This school had been formed at\r\nDover in September 1915, and two months later had been moved to Hythe,\r\nwhere firing from the air could be more freely and safely practised. In\r\nthe earlier part of the war the observer's duties were usually\r\nundertaken by officers or non-commissioned officers who volunteered for\r\nthe business. When they joined the Flying Corps they already had some\r\nconsiderable acquaintance with the things to be observed--the\r\ndisposition and appearance of the mobile forces and earthworks of a\r\nmodern army--but their experience of observation from the air had to be\r\ngained over the enemy lines. It has always been the tendency of our air\r\nforces to make more of the pilot than of the observer. When battles in\r\nthe air became frequent, this tendency was strengthened. The pilot is\r\nthe captain of the craft. If he is killed, the craft cannot keep the\r\nair. But if more depends on the pilot, it is equally true to say that a\r\nhigher degree of cold-drawn courage is demanded from the observer. He\r\nsuffers with the pilot for all the pilot's mistakes. For hours together\r\nhe has nothing to do but to sit still and keep his eyes open. He has not\r\nthe relief that activity and the sense of control give to strained\r\nnerves. He is often an older man than the pilot, and better able to\r\nrecognize danger. There is no more splendid record of service in the war\r\nthan the record of the best observers. The two embroidered wings of the\r\npilot's badge are the mark of a gallant profession, and are worn by\r\nnovices and veterans alike; the single wing of the observer's badge was\r\nthe mark of service done over the fire of enemy guns.\r\n\r\nIt has already been told how a large scheme for the expansion of the\r\nRoyal Flying Corps was set on foot at home by Lord Kitchener, Colonel\r\nTrenchard, and Colonel Brancker. In November 1914 Colonel Trenchard was\r\ngiven the command of the First Wing. In August 1915 he succeeded General\r\nHenderson in the command of the Royal Flying Corps in France. General\r\nHenderson had held this command during the whole of the first year of\r\nthe war. Under his guidance the new, small, tentative air force, which\r\nhe had done so much to create and foster, took its part in a great\r\nEuropean war, and rapidly gained recognition for itself from the other\r\nbranches of the service. When he relinquished his command in the field,\r\nGeneral Henderson continued until October 1917 to be General Officer\r\nCommanding the Royal Flying Corps, and Director-General of Military\r\nAeronautics. Soon after that, when the Air Ministry was formed, he was\r\ngiven a seat on the Air Council, which he resigned in March 1918. At the\r\nclose of the war he took over the control of the International Red Cross\r\norganization at Geneva, where he did good work until his death in August\r\n1921. He was a white man, a good friend, and an honourable enemy,\r\nhigh-spirited and sensitive--too sensitive to be happy among those\r\ncompromises and makeshifts which are usual in the world of politics. The\r\nfirst chief of the Royal Flying Corps was a loyal and simple soldier.\r\n\r\nMen take their turn and pass, but their work lives after them. The story\r\nof the Royal Flying Corps during the war is a continuous story of\r\ngrowth. Better, faster, and more numerous machines; more powerful, more\r\ntrustworthy, and more numerous engines; better trained, more skilful,\r\nand more numerous pilots--the increase went on, when once the initial\r\ndifficulties were vanquished, by leaps and bounds. The growth in power\r\nand bulk is striking enough, but the vitality of the new force is even\r\nbetter seen in the growing diversity of its purposes and of the tasks\r\nwhich it was called on to perform. Reconnaissance, or observation, can\r\nnever be superseded; knowledge comes before power; and the air is first\r\nof all a place to see from. It is also a place to strike from, but,\r\nspeaking historically, offensive action in the air, on any large scale,\r\nbegan, as had been anticipated, in the effort of the conflicting forces\r\nto deprive each other of the opportunity and means of vision. As the\r\nBritish expeditionary force grew, more squadrons of reconnaissance\r\nmachines were required to serve the armies, their principal duties being\r\nto observe for the artillery and to photograph enemy positions. While\r\nthey could perform these duties, they were content, but before very long\r\nthey could not perform them. The change in the situation is well\r\nsummarized in a letter written on the 31st of July 1915 by Colonel\r\nBrooke-Popham to Colonel Ashmore, who commanded the Administrative Wing\r\nin England. 'The German aeroplanes', says Colonel Brooke-Popham, 'are\r\nbecoming far more active, and are making a regular habit of attacking\r\nour machines when on reconnaissance, and we are having to fight for all\r\nour information. We are now having fights by pairs of machines, as well\r\nas individual duels. It will probably be necessary to send machines by\r\npairs or even by flights on all reconnaissances. The General Officer\r\nCommanding, therefore, wants you to practise flying by pairs of machines\r\nin keeping station. Simple manoeuvres might also be carried out.' That\r\nthis forecast was correct is shown by a letter sent in March 1916 from\r\nGeneral Headquarters to the War Office. 'Under existing conditions,' the\r\nletter runs, 'it is essential to provide protection in the form of\r\npatrols for machines employed on artillery work. Information can no\r\nlonger be obtained by despatching single machines on reconnaissance\r\nduties. The information has now to be fought for, and it is necessary\r\nfor reconnaissances to consist of at least five machines flying in\r\nformation.'\r\n\r\nFighting in the air had by 1916 become a regular incident of\r\nreconnaissance work. But when once fighting machines were produced, it\r\nwas obvious that their use would not be restricted to attacks on enemy\r\naircraft. Bombing raids on enemy positions became a regular duty of the\r\nFlying Corps. A machine built to take a heavy load of bombs is clumsy\r\nand slow in manoeuvre, not well able to repel the attack of light\r\nfighting scouts. To borrow a phrase from the pilots, it is cold meat in\r\nthe air. Hence bombing raids were carried out chiefly at night, and\r\nnight flying, on machines designed for the purpose, became another\r\nspecial duty of the Flying Corps. These raids were what may be called\r\nshort-distance raids, aimed at the aerodromes, munition stores, and\r\ncommunications of the German forces on the western front. They were\r\nfollowed, later, by long-distance raids, carried out by the Independent\r\nAir Force of 1918 against those centres in Germany which were sources of\r\nsupply for the German army. In his dispatch of January 1919, on the work\r\nof the Independent Air Force, General Trenchard reviews and summarizes\r\nwhat had been his policy from the beginning. It was necessary, he says,\r\nto equip the British expeditionary force on the western front with\r\nsufficient aircraft to hold and beat the German aerial forces on the\r\nwestern front; the bombing of Germany was a luxury till this had been\r\naccomplished, but once this had been accomplished, it became a\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nA good general idea of the growth of the Flying Corps can be obtained\r\nfrom a study of the programmes put up in 1915 to Sir John French, and in\r\nlater years to Sir Douglas Haig, by the command of the Flying Corps in\r\nthe field. These programmes are consistent and progressive; they look\r\nahead, and attempt to provide the Flying Corps, in good time, with the\r\nmeans of meeting the demands certain to be made on it. On the 21st of\r\nAugust 1915, some two or three days after he had taken over the command\r\nin the field, Colonel Trenchard wrote to the Chief of the General Staff\r\nat General Headquarters. In this letter he speaks of the number of\r\nhostile aeroplanes seen on the Second Army front, and asks for another\r\nsquadron to be sent out from home by the middle of September. 'I think a\r\nguide for the future', he says, 'should be at least one squadron to each\r\ncorps, one squadron to each army headquarters, and one for General\r\nHeadquarters.' The corps squadrons were needed for artillery work and\r\nphotography; the others to carry out reconnaissances for the three\r\narmies and for General Headquarters. On this basis he asks for three\r\nmore squadrons as soon as possible. 'In addition I would ask that a\r\nsquadron per army be sent out when formed, for special work such as bomb\r\nraids.' His plea for a good supply of anti-aircraft guns illustrates a\r\ndifference which persisted throughout the war between British and German\r\nusages. The British corps machines were incessantly at work over the\r\nenemy. The German corps machines were more prudent. Their constant\r\npractice was to carry out their observation of artillery fire and their\r\nphotographic work obliquely, from a position in the air low down over\r\ntheir own lines, so that they were protected by their own guns, and\r\ncould be attacked from the air only at very great risk. But the German\r\nanti-aircraft guns had already succeeded in hitting some of our\r\naeroplanes when they were flying more than three miles inside our own\r\nlines, at a height of six thousand feet. If we had guns as good as this,\r\nsays Colonel Trenchard, and in sufficient number, we could attack the\r\nGerman machines and could protect our own machines when they are at\r\nwork above the enemy lines. Hostile aeroplanes are easier to see from\r\nthe ground than from the air, and the bursts of our anti-aircraft shell\r\nwould serve to show our aircraft the whereabouts of enemy machines.\r\n\r\nAt this time there were three British armies on the western front. When\r\nnews came in September that a Fourth Army was about to be formed,\r\nGeneral Trenchard at once asked for a fourth wing, to consist of\r\nheadquarters and three squadrons.\r\n\r\nThese demands were all fulfilled as soon as the uncertainty of\r\ndeliveries permitted. In March 1916, some three and a half months before\r\nthe beginning of the battles of the Somme, General Trenchard took\r\nanother step forward. The work to be done by the Royal Flying Corps had\r\noutgrown its strength. Each of the British armies on the front had\r\nallotted to it at this time one brigade of the Royal Flying Corps,\r\nconsisting of two aeroplane wings, namely, a corps wing and an army\r\nwing, and two kite balloon sections. But in practice it had been found\r\nnecessary to use the squadrons of the corps wing to help the army wing\r\nin patrol work, army reconnaissance, and bombing, so that corps\r\ncommanders were often deprived of the essential services of the Flying\r\nCorps in artillery work and photography. General Trenchard's proposals,\r\naccepted and forwarded by the Chief of the General Staff, were based on\r\nthe assumption that thirty-two squadrons would be in France by the\r\nmiddle of April. Sixteen of these, it was recommended, should be\r\nallotted, one to every corps of the four armies, for corps work; twelve\r\nto the four armies, at the rate of three squadrons to each army, for\r\narmy work; and four squadrons to General Headquarters.\r\n\r\nEver since the formation of the Royal Flying Corps a squadron had\r\nconsisted of twelve machines, that is, three flights of four machines\r\neach. It was now recommended and agreed that this number should be\r\nraised to eighteen, that is, three flights of six machines each, and\r\nthat the establishment of pilots should be raised from twelve to twenty\r\nfor each squadron. It was further agreed that the raising of all\r\nsquadrons to the higher establishment should take precedence over the\r\nformation of new squadrons.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of June 1916, a fortnight before the battles of the Somme\r\nopened, the Commander-in-Chief, Sir Douglas Haig, wrote to the War\r\nOffice, submitting further proposals for the expansion of the Royal\r\nFlying Corps. By the spring of 1917, he says, the British army in France\r\nwill consist of five armies of four corps each. For these a total of\r\nfifty-six squadrons will be required, each squadron to consist of\r\neighteen machines. 'I fully realize', he says, 'that my demand for this\r\nlarge number of squadrons involves the provision of a very large number\r\nof pilots and observers. The importance of this service, however, is so\r\ngreat that I consider it essential that the necessary personnel should\r\nbe found even at the expense of a reduction in other directions.' The\r\nincreased establishment of the squadrons will involve, he adds, a\r\ncorresponding increase in the parks and depots; and in addition to all\r\nthis, a total of sixty kite-balloon sections will eventually be\r\nrequired. This programme of requirements, he concludes, does not allow\r\nfor long-distance bombing raids on a large scale. An addition of ten\r\nmore squadrons is recommended for this purpose. Such raids are good and\r\nuseful if the time and place are carefully chosen in connexion with the\r\nneeds of the campaign. Otherwise they may do harm; and they are always\r\nattended by considerable risk of losses.\r\n\r\nDuring the three months of the battles of the Somme the Royal Flying\r\nCorps maintained a clear measure of superiority over the enemy in the\r\nair. At the close of those battles, on the 30th of September 1916, Sir\r\nDouglas Haig informed the War Office that the enemy had been making\r\nextraordinary efforts to increase the number and develop the speed and\r\npower of his fighting machines, and within the last few days had brought\r\ninto action a considerable number of fighting aeroplanes which were\r\nfaster, handier, and capable of attaining a greater height than any of\r\nthe British machines, with the exception of three squadrons composed of\r\nNieuports, F.E.'s, and Sopwiths. To meet this situation he asked for\r\nmore and better fighting aeroplanes, and promised a further statement,\r\nto be based on the estimate of the General Officer Commanding the Royal\r\nFlying Corps. Fighting in the air continued to increase, and on the 16th\r\nof November Sir Douglas Haig asked for twenty additional fighting\r\nsquadrons. 'Aerial battles on a large scale', he says, 'have practically\r\nsuperseded individual combats, with the result that, in order to get\r\ninformation and to allow artillery machines to carry on their work, it\r\nis becoming more and more necessary for the fighting squadrons to be in\r\nstrength in the air the whole day.'\r\n\r\nThe new types of machine asked for did not arrive until the spring of\r\nthe following year, and they could not be used to advantage on their\r\narrival, for the pilots had first to learn to handle them. Accordingly,\r\nas early as April 1917, General Trenchard wrote to the Director-General\r\nof Military Aeronautics, outlining the requirements of the Royal Flying\r\nCorps for the winter of 1917 and the spring of 1918. 'I anticipate', he\r\nsays, 'that the Germans will produce a machine as much better than their\r\npresent Albatross scout as the Albatross scout is better than the\r\nFokker.' The great need was still single-seater fighters, and he urges\r\nthat all available energy should be concentrated on these.\r\n\r\nThese programmes have been quoted, not so much to show how fighting in\r\nthe air became, in 1916, the most important activity of the Royal Flying\r\nCorps, as to illustrate the initiative and foresight of the command.\r\nExperience at the front of our own successes and failures, and of the\r\nsuccesses and failures of the Germans, suggested the needs of the\r\nfuture; the provision to be made, so that we might be able to meet those\r\nneeds, was thought out beforehand, and was carefully and completely\r\nstated for the information of the authorities at home. Disappointment\r\nwas inevitable; there were hitches and delays in design and manufacture;\r\nconditions changed and machines improved at such a rate that a programme\r\nbecame an antique almost before it could be completely fulfilled. The\r\ngrowing pains of the Royal Flying Corps were severe, for the growth was\r\nfast; but it grew under quick supervision, and was shaped by the lessons\r\nof the war. The Flying Corps would take no denial; when the carrying out\r\nof a programme was long delayed, they looked yet farther ahead, and\r\nplanned a still larger establishment. On the 20th of November 1917 Sir\r\nDouglas Haig wrote to the Secretary of the War Office. In this letter he\r\npoints out that when the programme submitted in 1916 shall be completed,\r\nsome eighteen months to two years will have elapsed from the date when\r\nit was first accepted. 'I consider it expedient, therefore, even at the\r\nrisk of dislocating existing arrangements, to submit a further programme\r\nto cover the requirements of the British armies in France up to the\r\nsummer of 1919, in so far as these can be foreseen at present.'\r\n\r\nThe approved establishment of the Royal Flying Corps in France, at the\r\ntime when Sir Douglas Haig wrote, was eighty-six squadrons, ten of which\r\nwere long-distance bombing squadrons. His new demand was for a hundred\r\nand seventy-nine squadrons, that is to say, a hundred and thirteen for\r\nthe British armies in France and Italy, and sixty-six long-distance\r\nbombing squadrons for use against Germany. Further, he asks that the\r\nestablishment of the fighting squadrons shall be raised to twenty-four\r\nmachines. Formation tactics have developed; a squadron commonly goes\r\ninto a fight with three flights of six machines each, working in\r\nechelon; to maintain this strength when some machines are temporarily\r\nout of action the squadron must number twenty-four machines.\r\n\r\nThe Army Council approved of all these demands, and suggested further\r\nadditions, so that the programme, when it left their hands, provided for\r\na total of two hundred and forty squadrons, all told. The coming of the\r\narmistice interrupted the fulfilment of these large plans, and saved the\r\nworld from a carnival of destruction.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the air force was a long process. The large plans which\r\nwere made within a few days of the outbreak of war took years to\r\nachieve. In the early part of the war the first duty of those who were\r\nin charge at home was to supply needed reinforcements, both pilots and\r\nmachines, to the original squadrons in the field. This was a small\r\nmatter in comparison with the efforts of later years, but it was very\r\ndifficult. Pilots were hard to come by at short notice. The first demand\r\nfrom France for reinforcements was telegraphed from Amiens on the 18th\r\nof August 1914, and asked that Captain H. C. Jackson of the Bedfordshire\r\nRegiment and Captain E. W. Furse of the Royal Artillery should be sent\r\nto France to replace casualties. These were Staff College students who\r\nwere nominated for attachment to the Royal Flying Corps on mobilization.\r\nA few days later, on the 22nd of August, a request came for any spare\r\naeroplanes and for pilots to fly them over. Five machines were scraped\r\ntogether, which were all that were available, namely, an R.E. 1, a B.E.\r\n8, two B.E. 2's, and a Bleriot. Five pilots were found to fly them,\r\nincluding Second-Lieutenant C. Gordon Bell and Second-Lieutenant B. C.\r\nHucks. On the 9th of September, in response to a request for fighting\r\nmachines, 'C' Flight of No. 4 Squadron, consisting of Maurice Farman\r\nShorthorn aeroplanes fitted with machine-guns, was sent to France. These\r\nmachines took part in many aerial combats, but without much success, for\r\nthey were slower than the enemy machines, and their guns very often\r\njammed at critical moments. In the telegram offering these machines the\r\nfollowing sentences occur: 'Lord Kitchener wishes to give you all\r\nreplacements possible, but at the same time wishes to continue\r\norganizing squadrons at home for use with reinforcements (that is to\r\nsay, with the divisions of the New Army). Please say if you like flights\r\nof R.E. 5's and Maurice Farmans, but if they go other pilots must be\r\nsent home to keep things going here.'\r\n\r\nIf only instructors could be obtained, pilots could be turned out more\r\nrapidly than machines. Moreover, pilots, unlike machines, could not be\r\nobtained from foreign nations. In the event a small but steady stream of\r\nqualified pilots came from the Central Flying School and the\r\nsupplementary training stations for the reinforcement of the original\r\nsquadrons.\r\n\r\nFor the supply of machines during the earlier period of our preparation\r\nwe were chiefly dependent on the French. They were ready, and we were\r\nnot. Their magnificent aviation held the air while we prepared ourselves\r\nfor our task. They had many factories in good working order, so that\r\nthey were able to supply us with machines and spare parts in large\r\nnumbers. During the last four months of 1914, from the end of August to\r\nthe end of December, the Royal Flying Corps received twenty-four\r\nmachines from home, fitted with French engines, and twenty-six from\r\nFrance. These last were chiefly Bleriots and Henri Farmans. In October\r\nGeneral Henderson posted Captain James Valentine of the Royal Flying\r\nCorps to Paris, to organize a department for the supply of machines,\r\nengines, spares and stores, and to report on the performances of all new\r\nmachines. In December the Admiralty followed suit and posted Lieutenant\r\nFarnol Thurstan to Paris to fulfil similar duties on behalf of the Royal\r\nNaval Air Service. The French Government were courteous and willing, but\r\na certain amount of bargaining was inevitable, for if we wanted their\r\naircraft, they wanted our raw material, especially steel, and our Lewis\r\nguns. The arrangements were entrusted to a series of conferences, and\r\nsubsequently to a joint commission. In spite of difficulties the supply\r\nwent forward. It was not until 1916 that we began to be independent of\r\nthe French factories. In the four months August to November 1915 the\r\ntotal value of the orders which were placed in France for aeroplanes,\r\nengines, spare parts, and other accessories, was not much short of\r\ntwelve million francs. It was this help from our Allies that enabled us\r\nto make progress during the first year of the war. By the 31st of May\r\n1915 five hundred and thirty aeroplanes had been taken into the service\r\nand about three hundred had been struck off as lost or worn out. On the\r\nsame date orders for two thousand two hundred and sixty aeroplanes were\r\nin progress.\r\n\r\nThe story of the expansion of the Royal Flying Corps for military uses\r\nis simple and clear, as its main purpose was simple and clear. Its\r\nbusiness was to furnish the army with eyes, to observe all enemy\r\noperations, and especially the operations of enemy artillery. Its later\r\nuses grew out of this, as the branches grow out of the stem of a tree.\r\nFrom the aerodromes which were ranged all along the British front in\r\nFrance our machines crossed the lines every day, to give help to the\r\nGeneral Staff, to give help to the gunners and the infantry, to carry\r\ndestruction to the enemy. The Flying Corps tried to keep pace with the\r\ngrowth of the army which needed its help. Its own growth was continuous;\r\nthe problems which presented themselves to those who superintended that\r\ngrowth were problems of supply, adjustment, and efficiency. The need was\r\ncertain; the only question was how the need might be best and quickest\r\nsupplied. A good aeroplane, flown by a skilled pilot, could always find\r\nwork of the first importance waiting for it on the western front.\r\n\r\nThe story of the development and expansion of the Royal Naval Air\r\nService is a different kind of story. As the first business of the Royal\r\nFlying Corps was to help the army, so the first business of the Royal\r\nNaval Air Service was to help the navy. But this business of helping the\r\nnavy was a much more difficult and complicated business than the other.\r\nTo help the army from fixed aerodromes behind the line of battle was a\r\ndangerous and gallant affair, but it was not difficult. In the ease of\r\nits solution the military problem was child's play compared with the\r\nnaval problem. How was the navy to be helped? As early as 1912 a policy\r\nfor the employment of the Naval Wing of the Royal Flying Corps was laid\r\nbefore the Board of Admiralty by Captain Murray Sueter. In this\r\nstatement the duties of naval aircraft were laid down; the two first to\r\nbe mentioned were: '(1) Distance reconnaissance work with the fleet at\r\nsea. (2) Reconnaissance work off the enemy coast, working from detached\r\ncruisers or special aeroplane ships.' The policy is clear and sound; but\r\na world of ingenuity and toil was involved in those two short\r\nphrases--'with the fleet at sea', and 'working from detached cruisers'.\r\nAircraft must work from a base; when they had to work with the army on\r\nland all that was needed was to set up some huts in certain meadows in\r\nFrance. For aerial work with the fleet at sea the necessary preparations\r\nwere much more expensive and elaborate. Sea-going vessels had to be\r\nconstructed or adapted to carry seaplanes or aeroplanes and to serve as\r\na floating and travelling aerodrome. The seaplane itself, in the early\r\ndays of the war, was very far from perfect efficiency. It could not rise\r\nfrom a troubled sea, nor alight on it, without disaster. Accidents to\r\nseaplanes were so numerous, in these early days, that senior naval\r\nofficers were prejudiced against the seaplane, and, for the most part,\r\nhad no great faith in the value of the help that was offered by the\r\nRoyal Naval Air Service.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet well knew the value to the\r\nfleet of aerial observation, but the means were not to hand. The airship\r\nexperiment had broken down. Such airships as were available in the early\r\npart of the war had not the necessary power and range. To build a vessel\r\nwhich should be able to carry seaplanes or aeroplanes for work with the\r\nfleet was not a simple matter. Such a vessel would be an encumbrance\r\nunless it could keep station with the Grand Fleet or with the Battle\r\nCruiser Squadron, that is, unless it could steam up to thirty knots for\r\na period of many hours together. Further, a stationary ship at sea is\r\nexposed to attack by submarines, so that it was desirable, if not\r\nnecessary, that the flying machines should be able to take the air and\r\nreturn to their base without stopping the ship. This consideration led,\r\nat a later period of the war, to the use by the navy of aeroplanes flown\r\nfrom specially constructed decks. But this was a matter of time and\r\nexperiment. As early as December 1911 Commander Samson had succeeded in\r\nflying off the deck of H.M.S. _Africa_, and when the war broke out the\r\n_Hermes_, which had formerly served as headquarters for the Royal Naval\r\nAir Service, was fitted with a launching-deck for aeroplanes. The\r\n_Hermes_ was sunk in the third month of the war; thereafter the _Ark\r\nRoyal_, the _Campania_, the _Vindex_, the _Manxman_, the _Furious_, the\r\n_Pegasus_, and the _Nairana_ were each of them successively fitted with\r\na launching-deck. But launching proved easier than alighting. It may\r\nseem to be a simple thing for an aeroplane to overtake a ship that is\r\nbeing driven into the wind, and to alight quietly on its afterdeck. But\r\nimmediately behind such a ship there is always a strong up-current of\r\nair. This up-current--the bump that the albatross sits on--is what makes\r\nthe difficulty and danger of the attempt. An aeroplane which resists it\r\nby diving through it will almost certainly crash on the deck beyond. The\r\nbusiness of landing an aeroplane on the ship from which it had been\r\nlaunched was not accomplished until the 2nd of August 1917, when Flight\r\nCommander E. H. Dunning succeeded, at Scapa Flow, in landing a Sopwith\r\nPup on the forecastle deck of the _Furious_, while she was under way.\r\nFive days later, when he was repeating this performance, his machine\r\nrolled over into the sea, and he was drowned. His work was not lost; the\r\n_Furious_ was fitted thereafter with a special landing-deck aft, and it\r\nwas by naval aeroplanes flown from the deck of the _Furious_ that one of\r\nthe large Zeppelin sheds at Tondern was destroyed on the 19th of July\r\n1918.\r\n\r\nThe next ships in the succession were the _Vindictive_, the _Argus_\r\n(which was the first ship to be fitted with a flush deck), the _Eagle_,\r\nand the new _Hermes_, which last two ships were unfinished at the time\r\nof the armistice.\r\n\r\nIn this matter of aerial work for the navy the whole period of the war\r\nwas a period of experiment rather than achievement. The conditions of\r\nexperiment were hard enough, when all the shipyards and factories of the\r\ncountry were working at full pressure in the effort to make good our\r\nheavy losses in merchant shipping. Yet experiment continued, and\r\nprogress was made. Three new forms of aircraft deserve special mention.\r\nThe kite balloon, the small improvised airship called the submarine\r\nscout, and last, though not least, the flying boat, were all invented or\r\nbrought into use by the Naval Air Service during the course of the war.\r\n\r\nFor stationary aerial observation the means employed in England, before\r\nthe war, were the captive spherical balloon and the man-lifting kite.\r\nMany successful experiments with the man-lifting kite, or groups of\r\nkites, had been carried out, especially by Major B. F. S. Baden-Powell,\r\nduring the closing years of the nineteenth century. But both the balloon\r\nand the kite had serious faults. The kite cannot be efficiently operated\r\nin a wind of less than twenty miles an hour, and the spherical balloon\r\ncannot be operated in a wind of more than twenty miles an hour. The\r\nballoon except in the lightest of breezes, and the kite at all times,\r\ngive a very unsteady platform for observation, so that field-glasses are\r\ndifficult to use. The merits of both kite and balloon were combined and\r\nthe faults of both were remedied in the kite balloon. The attachment of\r\na kite to the upper hemisphere of an ordinary spherical balloon, on the\r\ncable side, to prevent the balloon from rotating in a wind, had been\r\nproposed by a private inventor as early as 1885, but nothing came of it.\r\nThe kite balloon which was used in the war was invented in 1894 by Major\r\nvon Parseval, the German airship designer, and Captain von Sigsfeld.\r\nThis balloon is sausage shaped; the cable is attached to the forward\r\nportion; the rear end carries an air-rudder, and is weighted down by the\r\ncar, or basket. Extending outwards at right angles on both sides of the\r\nrear portion of the balloon is a wind-sail which does the office of a\r\nkite and assists in preventing the rudder end of the balloon from being\r\ntoo much depressed by the weight of the car. The balloon is divided into\r\ntwo segments; the forward segment is filled with gas, the rear segment\r\nis kept full of air through a circular entrance attached, facing the\r\nwind, to the under surface of the balloon. But the steadying of the\r\nballoon is mainly achieved by the air-rudder, which is another inflated\r\nsausage, curved round the under side of the rear end of the balloon, and\r\nautomatically filled with air through a valve at its forward end. The\r\nkite balloon is the ugliest thing that man has ever seen when he looks\r\nup at the sky, but it serves its purpose.\r\n\r\nBefore the war, kite balloons, often called 'Drachen' balloons, had been\r\na German secret. The French and Belgians had obtained drawings of them,\r\nand at the outbreak of war had some few ready for use. Moreover, the\r\nFrench were at work on their 'Cacquot' balloon, an improvement on the\r\n'Drachen' in that it made use of a new and more convenient stabilizing\r\ndevice. Where the 'Drachen' had used a long and clumsy string of\r\nparachute streamers attached to the tail, the 'Cacquot' achieved the\r\nsame result by means of stabilizing fins attached to the balloon itself.\r\n\r\nIn October 1914 Wing Commander Maitland was sent to Belgium in command\r\nof a captive balloon detachment, to carry out aerial spotting for the\r\nguns of monitors working off the coast between Nieuport and Coxyde. His\r\ntwo balloons, which were spherical, proved to be useless in a strong\r\nwind. In January 1915 he made acquaintance with a 'Drachen' balloon\r\nwhich the Belgians were using in the neighbourhood of Alveringheim. He\r\nwas allowed to inspect this balloon and to take measurements and\r\nphotographs. In January and February he sent home reasoned reports to\r\nthe Air Department of the Admiralty, urging that kite-balloon sections\r\nshould be formed in the British air service. He also sent Flight\r\nCommander J. D. Mackworth to Chalais-Meudon, the French kite-balloon\r\ncentre, and in the second and fuller of his reports he embodied the\r\ntechnical information which had been gathered from the French.\r\n\r\nThese reports were acted on at once. Wing Commander Maitland was\r\nrecalled from Belgium, and a centre was established at Roehampton, to\r\ntrain kite-balloon sections for active service. In March 1915 two kite\r\nballoons, an old type of winch, and a length of cable were received from\r\nthe French, who also lent competent instructors and a generous supply of\r\naccessories.\r\n\r\nJust at this time General Birdwood, who had been sent by Lord Kitchener\r\nto the Dardanelles to report on the possibilities of a landing, and\r\nAdmiral de Robeck, who was in command of the naval forces there,\r\ntelegraphed to the War Office and the Admiralty that a man-lifting kite\r\nor a captive balloon would be of great use to the navy for spotting\r\nlong-range fire and detecting concealed batteries. The Admiralty at once\r\nappropriated a tramp steamer, S.S. _Manica_, which was lying at\r\nManchester, fitted her with a rough and ready apparatus, and on the 27th\r\nof March dispatched her with a kite-balloon section under Flight\r\nCommander J. D. Mackworth to the Dardanelles. This was the first kite\r\nballoon used by us in the war, and, it is believed, the first\r\nkite-balloon ship fitted out by any navy. The observation work done from\r\nthe _Manica_ was good and useful, especially during the earlier phase of\r\nthe operations, and the difficulties encountered suggested many\r\nimprovements in the balloon and in the ship. Orders were given for six\r\nballoon ships to be fitted out.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Beatty, in August 1915, recommended that the work of aerial\r\nobservation for the fleet should be done by kite balloons, towed by\r\nvessels accompanying the Battle Cruiser Squadron, and some trials were\r\nmade which demonstrated the value of this suggestion. But here again\r\nvery elaborate experiments were necessary before authorizing any large\r\nprogramme of construction, and in the meantime production on a\r\nconsiderable scale had become difficult, for the kite balloon, which was\r\nfirst manufactured in this country to the order of the navy, was already\r\nin great demand by the army for use on the western front. As early as\r\nApril 1915 the Army Council had asked the Admiralty to supply kite\r\nballoons for aerial observation with the expeditionary force in France,\r\nand by August of that year five kite-balloon sections had gone overseas\r\nand were doing invaluable work on the western front. At this point the\r\nkite-balloon sections working with the army were taken over by the War\r\nOffice, but the Admiralty continued to provide the necessary material\r\nand equipment. Great Britain was involved in the greatest land war she\r\nhad ever known, and the navy, with all the wealth of its inventive\r\nresources, stood by to help the army.\r\n\r\nThe two other forms of aircraft which were invented or adapted by the\r\nnavy for the needs of the war, that is to say, the submarine scout\r\nairship and the flying boat, must here be mentioned and their origin\r\ndescribed; but their great achievement belongs to the later period of\r\nthe war, when the defeat of the German submarine campaign had become a\r\nmatter of life or death for the British Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe small airship called the 'S.S.', or Submarine Scout, was an\r\ninvention of the first year of the war. On the 28th of February 1915\r\nAdmiral Fisher sent for Commander E. A. D. Masterman and Wing Commander\r\nN. F. Usborne, and told them that he wanted some small, fairly fast\r\nairships to operate against the German submarines, and that he wanted\r\nthem at once. There was no time for experiment or the elaboration of new\r\ndesigns; speed in production was essential, and speed could not be\r\nattained except by the adaptation of existing types and the use of\r\nstandard parts. The navy is seen at its best when it has to rise to an\r\nunforeseen occasion; within three weeks the first of the now famous\r\nS.S.'s was ready for service. For the design of this airship it is as\r\ndifficult to apportion credit among the small band of naval officers who\r\nhad a hand in it as it is to divide the praise for the first flying\r\nmachine between the brotherhood of the Wrights. The idea seems to have\r\nbeen struck out during a conversation in the mess at Farnborough at\r\nwhich there were present the late Wing Commander N. F. Usborne, Flight\r\nLieutenant T. R. Cave-Browne-Cave, and Mr. F. M. Green of the Royal\r\nAircraft Factory. In the result the body, or fuselage, of a B.E. 2c\r\naeroplane was slung on to the envelope of a Willows airship, and the job\r\nwas done. The success of this airship was as great as its design was\r\nsimple. It fairly fulfilled the main requirements--to remain aloft for\r\neight hours in all ordinary kinds of weather, with a speed of from forty\r\nto fifty miles an hour, and carrying a load which should include a\r\nwireless telegraphy installation for the purposes of report and a\r\nhundred and sixty pounds' weight of bombs for more immediate use. The\r\nfirst twenty-five of these ships to be produced were fitted with the 70\r\nhorse-power Renault engine. Variations and improvements of the design\r\nfollowed in steady succession, providing greater endurance, and more\r\ncomfortable cars for the crew. One of these variants, the C. 1 or\r\ncoastal type, used an Astra-Torres envelope and a car made from two Avro\r\nfuselages with the tails cut off; a later and larger design, the N.S. 1,\r\nor North Sea type, in use at the end of the war, had an endurance, on\r\noccasion, of from two to three days.\r\n\r\nAirship work against submarines, an authority on the subject has\r\nremarked, partakes of the nature of research work. An airship is\r\ncomparatively slow in manoeuvring, and is an instrument of knowledge\r\nrather than of power. For swift assault on submarines, once they are\r\nlocated, the seaplane is better; but the seaplane was not seaworthy. The\r\nneed for some kind of aircraft which should be able to search the North\r\nSea far and wide for submarines, and, having found them, should be able\r\nto destroy them without calling for the assistance of surface craft, was\r\nmet by the development of the flying boat. There was a flying boat in\r\nuse by the navy before the war--the small pusher Sopwith Bat boat. It\r\nhad a stepped hull, like a racing motor-boat, about twenty feet long and\r\nfour feet in the beam. This was the only flying boat used by the Naval\r\nAir Service when the war began; when it ended they were flying the\r\n_Felixstowe Fury_, a giant boat triplane which, with its load, weighed\r\nfifteen tons, was driven by five 360 horse-power engines, and carried\r\nfour guns in addition to a supply of heavy bombs. The development of\r\nthis type of aircraft for the purposes of the war must be credited\r\nchiefly to the late Lieutenant-Colonel John Cyril Porte, who had been an\r\nofficer of the Royal Navy and a pioneer of aviation. As early as 1909,\r\nwhen he was a naval lieutenant, he had experimented with a glider on\r\nPortsdown Hill, near Portsmouth. Two years later he was invalided out of\r\nthe service, and devoted his enforced leisure to aviation. He learned to\r\nfly at Rheims, on a Deperdussin monoplane, and in 1912 was appointed\r\ntechnical director and designer of the British Deperdussin Company. The\r\nfirst British-built monoplane of this type, with a 100 horse-power\r\nAnzani engine, was of his design, and was flown by him at the Military\r\nAeroplane Trials on Salisbury Plain in 1912. After the trials he flew to\r\nHendon, a distance of eighty-two miles, in one hour and five minutes.\r\nDuring the following summer he spent some time experimenting with a\r\nwaterplane at Osea Island in Essex. When the British Deperdussin Company\r\nwas broken up he went to America, and joined Mr. Glenn Curtiss at\r\nHammondsport, New York, in the task of designing a flying boat to cross\r\nthe Atlantic. Then the war came; on the day it was declared he sailed\r\nfor England, re-entered the navy, and was at once made a squadron\r\ncommander of the Royal Naval Air Service. For a time he was in command\r\nof the newly-formed naval air station at Hendon, where he trained pilots\r\nfor the service; then, in September 1915, he was given the command of\r\nthe Felixstowe Naval Air Station. This was his opportunity, and he did\r\nnot let it slip. The Curtiss flying boats which were procured from\r\nAmerica were of inferior workmanship and had many faults. He patiently\r\nwent to work to improve and perfect them. 'There would probably not have\r\nbeen any big British flying boats', says one who worked with him, 'but\r\nfor the vision, persistence, and energy, in the face of disbelief and\r\ndiscouragement, of Colonel J. C. Porte, C.M.G., who designed and built\r\nat Felixstowe Air Station the experimental machine of each type of\r\nBritish flying boat successfully used in the service. His boats were\r\nvery large, the types used in the war weighing from four and a half to\r\nsix and a half tons, and carried sufficient petrol for work far out from\r\nland, and big enough bombs to damage or destroy a submarine otherwise\r\nthan by a direct hit.... The boats were very seaworthy, and no lives\r\nwere lost in operations from England owing to unseaworthiness.'\r\n\r\nThe technical problems to be faced were very difficult; and powerful\r\nflying boats were not in action till the spring of 1917. But this was\r\nin the nick of time to meet the great German submarine effort. During\r\nthe following year--the crucial year of the naval war--forty flying\r\nboats were put into commission; they sighted in all sixty-eight enemy\r\nsubmarines, and they bombed forty-four, some of which it was\r\nsubsequently proved that they had sunk.\r\n\r\nThrough all his strenuous work for the navy, Colonel Porte had to do\r\nbattle with ill health; he retired in 1919, and in October of that year\r\ndied suddenly at Brighton, in the thirty-sixth year of his age. The\r\nshortest possible list of those who saved the country in its hour of\r\nneed would have to include his name.\r\n\r\nAnother purely naval use of aircraft, on which, during the war, much\r\neffort was spent, was their use for the carrying and launching of\r\ntorpedoes. The torpedo has long been one of the chief weapons of naval\r\nwarfare; it is commonly carried by surface or submarine craft to the\r\nplace where it can be launched against the enemy. If it could be carried\r\nand launched by rapid aircraft, its value would be enormously increased,\r\nand the torpedo-carrying aeroplane or seaplane would outrival the\r\nsubmarine as a weapon of offence against enemy shipping. This was very\r\nearly recognized by those who were concerned in developing naval\r\naircraft. The first experiments are said to have been made in 1911 by an\r\nItalian, Captain Guidoni, who made use of a Farman machine, and released\r\nfrom it a torpedo weighing 352 pounds. In the same year the little group\r\nof naval officers who were superintending the construction of the\r\n_Mayfly_ at Barrow-in-Furness had many discussions on the subject. One\r\nof them, Lieutenant Hyde-Thomson, subsequently drafted a paper on\r\ntorpedo aircraft, with some rough sketches; in 1913 a design was got out\r\nat the Admiralty, and in the same year Mr. Sopwith constructed two\r\nsample machines. From this time onward the hope of using the torpedo,\r\nlaunched from the air, against ships which are sheltered and protected\r\nfrom naval attack, was never long absent from the minds of those who\r\ndirected the activities of the Royal Naval Air Service. It was this\r\nhope, more than anything else, which inspired the production of larger\r\nseaplanes and higher powered engines. At the naval review of July 1914,\r\na Short seaplane of 160 horse-power had been fitted, in a temporary\r\nfashion, to carry a 14-inch torpedo weighing 810 pounds. With the same\r\nend in view, after the war broke out, the principal manufacturers of\r\nmotor-cars were encouraged to develop air engines of high power,\r\nespecially the Sunbeam engine of 225 horse-power, and the Rolls-Royce\r\nengine, which played so distinguished a part in the war. When H.M.S.\r\n_Engadine_ was fitted out as a carrier in the first month of the war, it\r\nwas expressly stated by the Admiralty that her business was to carry\r\ntorpedo seaplanes to the scene of action. Later on, at Gallipoli,\r\nseaplanes shipped in the _Ben my Chree_ succeeded in flying across the\r\nIsthmus of Bulair and in torpedoing a merchant ship on the shore of the\r\nSea of Marmara, an ammunition ship at Ak Bashi Liman, and a steam tug in\r\nthe Straits.\r\n\r\nAll this seemed full of promise. The modern torpedo is a very efficient\r\nweapon, and the problem of designing an aeroplane or seaplane to carry\r\nit was a problem requiring adaptation rather than new invention. Yet the\r\ndevelopment of torpedo aircraft during the war was, in the words of an\r\nofficial memorandum, 'astonishingly slow'. After the Gallipoli exploits\r\nnothing of importance in this kind was achieved during the years that\r\nfollowed, until the very end of the war.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this disappointment were many. In the first place the\r\nseaplane, which seems almost as if it had been designed to carry a\r\ntorpedo suspended between its floats, was itself a disappointment. It\r\nproved to be a fair-weather craft. Seaplanes were used, early in the\r\nwar, to carry out reconnaissances in the neighbourhood of the Ems river;\r\nof those launched for this work more than half had their floats broken\r\nup, and sank before they could rise from the water. Moreover, in\r\naddition to this main objection, there were other obstacles to the\r\ndevelopment of torpedo-carrying aircraft. The chief of these were what\r\nare officially described as 'operational difficulties'. On the high\r\nseas, it must be remembered, and in other easily accessible waters,\r\nthere were no enemy ships to be attacked. To use torpedoes against\r\nwarships in their harbours or sheltered waters, specially designed\r\naircraft must first make long and difficult flights. In the meantime,\r\nwhile the war was young, there was a distressing shortage of aircraft\r\nfor other and more immediate purposes nearer home. The ships assigned as\r\ncarriers for aircraft had to be employed at times in mine-seeking and\r\nother necessary operations. The machines themselves were much in demand\r\nfor the purposes of reconnaissance. Experiment continued at Calshot;\r\npractice attacks were carried out with machines from Felixstowe, and\r\nconvinced the naval authorities of the value of torpedo aircraft; a\r\nsuccessful torpedo aeroplane, called the _Cuckoo_, was designed in 1916\r\nby Messrs. Sopwith, and was produced in the following year by Messrs.\r\nBlackburn; finally, in 1917, the Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet\r\nasked for two hundred torpedo aeroplanes to be provided for the fleet at\r\nthe earliest possible date. The bulk of these machines had to be made by\r\ninexperienced firms, so that the first squadron of torpedo aeroplanes\r\nfor the fleet was not completed till October 1918, when it embarked in\r\nH.M.S. _Argus_. There had been earlier schemes for a torpedo seaplane\r\nschool at Felixstowe and at Scapa in the Orkneys; but now, in the\r\nsummer of 1918, a torpedo aeroplane school was established at East\r\nFortune, and the 1918 programme arranged also for another torpedo\r\naeroplane school and a torpedo aeroplane experimental squadron, both at\r\nGosport.\r\n\r\nIn any future war there can be no doubt that torpedo aircraft will prove\r\nto be a weapon of enormous power. As Lieutenant Hyde-Thomson remarks in\r\na paper which he prepared in 1915, they will be a menace to the largest\r\nbattleship afloat. They have double the speed of a destroyer, and a\r\nlarge measure of that suddenness of attack which is the virtue of a\r\nsubmarine and the dread of its victims. The technical difficulties\r\nconnected with the release and aiming of the torpedo have been met and\r\nconquered, so that these craft, though they played no considerable part\r\nin the war, were brought by the pressure of war, which quickens all\r\nthings, to the stage of practical efficiency.\r\n\r\nSome minor causes of the delay in the development of torpedo aircraft\r\nmay perhaps be found. Those who pinned their faith to the Dreadnought as\r\nthe mainstay of naval power were not likely to be eager to improve a\r\nweapon which, more than any other, seemed likely to make the Dreadnought\r\nbelie its name. Moreover, the burden of a torpedo was never very popular\r\nwith pilots. A torpedo can be used only against its preordained target;\r\nit gives no protection to the aircraft that carries it, and its great\r\nweight makes the machine slower in manoeuvre and more vulnerable. This\r\nobjection was well stated by a German pilot who was taken prisoner in\r\nJune 1917. The Germans, in the early part of that year, formed at\r\nZeebrugge a flight of torpedo seaplanes, which had this advantage over\r\nour torpedo aircraft, that suitable targets were not lacking. These\r\nseaplanes sank three of our merchant ships in the vicinity of Margate\r\nand the Downs. Two of the seaplanes were shot down on the morning of\r\nthe 11th of June 1917 by the armed yacht _Diana_. In the report of the\r\nexamination of the German pilots it is told that both the prisoners\r\nseemed to deprecate this mode of flying, and to glory chiefly in their\r\nown single-seaters, which were smaller, swifter, and without\r\nencumbrance. 'Once you are given a two-seater,' said one of them, 'the\r\nauthorities start loading you up with cameras, machine-guns, bombs, and\r\nwireless, and now, to crown all, they actually hang a torpedo on your\r\nmachine!'\r\n\r\nThe new types of naval aircraft which were invented or developed during\r\nthe course of the war have now been briefly described. When a critical\r\naccount shall hereafter be rendered of the doings of the years 1914 to\r\n1918, regarded as an incident in the ever-lengthening history of human\r\nwarfare upon earth, these new departures in the use of naval aircraft\r\nwill probably be recognized as the chief contribution to sea-power made\r\nby the late war. Their importance is enormous, but their place in the\r\nactual history of the earlier years of the war is comparatively small.\r\nThe weapons of the Royal Naval Air Service, so far as purely naval uses\r\nwere concerned, were in a rudimentary state at the outbreak of war. A\r\nfighting service, suddenly engaged in a great war, must use the weapons\r\nit has; it cannot spend more than a margin of its time and thought on\r\nproblematic improvements. The Naval Air Service, when the war began, had\r\ngood machines and good pilots. The army had endeavoured, before the war,\r\nto establish, on behalf of the nation, a centralized control of\r\naeronautical manufacture, and the benefits of that policy, when the war\r\ncame, have already been described. The navy, following its traditional\r\nplan, and working on freer lines, had done all it could to encourage\r\nprivate effort, and so had greatly stimulated aeronautical invention and\r\nprogress. There was nothing inconsistent in the two policies; they were\r\nstronger together than either could have been alone. When the great\r\neffort was called for, the only thing that could be done at once was to\r\nmultiply the best existing types of machine, and to attempt, with the\r\nmeans available, to perform such tasks as might present themselves.\r\n\r\nBefore the war the principal firms employed by the Admiralty in the\r\nmanufacture of flying machines were: for seaplanes, Messrs. Short\r\nBrothers at Eastchurch, Messrs. Sopwith at Kingston-on-Thames, and\r\nMessrs. J. Samuel White & Co. at Cowes, who had produced the Wight\r\nseaplane; for aeroplanes, Messrs. Short and Messrs. Sopwith as before,\r\nthe British and Colonial Aeroplane Company at Bristol, and Messrs. A. V.\r\nRoe & Co. at Manchester. Orders as large as they could handle were\r\nplaced with all these firms on the outbreak of war. Further, a very\r\nlarge order for B.E. 2c machines was placed with various firms, who were\r\nto construct them by the aid of Government plans and specifications; and\r\nMessrs. Vickers received orders for their gun-carrying two-seater pusher\r\naeroplane known as the Vickers fighter.\r\n\r\nThe navy naturally paid more attention than the army to fighting in the\r\nair. They were committed to the defence of the coast and the beating off\r\nof hostile air-raids. In France, where the guns were going all day, the\r\nfirst need was for reconnaissance machines; the navy, who were farther\r\nfrom the enemy, had set their hearts on machines that should do more\r\nthan observe--machines that could fly far and hit hard. They diligently\r\nfostered the efforts of the leading motor-car companies, especially the\r\nSunbeam and Rolls-Royce, and so were instrumental in the production of\r\nvery efficient engines of high horse-power. In the second year of the\r\nwar the Admiralty proposed a competition among aeroplane-makers for a\r\nlarge bombing machine and a fast fighting aeroplane. In the result the\r\nShort machine for bombing, fitted with a 250 horse-power Rolls-Royce\r\nengine, was produced. Later on, the single-seater Sopwith Pup and the\r\ntwo-seater Sopwith 1-1/2 Strutter set the fashion in fighting machines,\r\nand did good work with the army at the battles of the Somme. The fact is\r\nthat in the early part of the war the best of the existing types of\r\naeroplane were more useful, as things stood, to the army than to the\r\nnavy, and when this was recognized a great part of the work of the Royal\r\nNaval Air Service took the form of help given to the British army.\r\n\r\nWhen in August 1915 Mr. Maurice Baring was sent to Rome on business\r\nconnected with aircraft, he records how he had speech with General\r\nMorris, who was in charge of Italian aviation. 'What I am going to say\r\nto you', said General Morris, 'will be absolutely unintelligible and\r\nunthinkable to you as Englishmen, but I regret to say that here, in\r\nItaly, it is a fact that there exists a certain want of harmony--a\r\ncertain occasional, shall I say, friction?--between the military and\r\nnaval branches of our flying service.' Mr. Baring was amused by this\r\nspeech, but he kept a grave countenance, and murmured, 'Impossible'.\r\n\r\nBoth the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service were eager\r\nto serve their country. Their rivalry was creditable to them. When they\r\nwere called on to co-operate, their relations were friendly and helpful.\r\nBut the pressing need for more and more aeroplanes on the western front\r\ndominated the situation. The Admiralty were many times asked by the\r\nmilitary authorities to hand over to the Royal Flying Corps large\r\nnumbers of machines and engines which were on order for the Royal Naval\r\nAir Service. To the best of their ability they fulfilled these requests,\r\nbut the zealous members of a patriotic service would be more or less\r\nthan human if they felt no regret on being deprived of the control of\r\ntheir own material.\r\n\r\nWhen the Royal Flying Corps was formed, in the spring of 1912, it was\r\nintended that either wing should be available to help the other. But\r\nbefore the war broke out the two had almost ceased to co-operate. The\r\nmethods and subjects of instruction were distinct. The discipline and\r\ntraining of the one wing were wholly military, of the other wholly\r\nnaval; and this severance had been officially recognized, just before\r\nthe war, by the transformation of the Naval Wing into the Royal Naval\r\nAir Service. In truth, while reconnaissance continued to be, what it was\r\nat the beginning of the war, almost the sole duty of aircraft, effective\r\nco-operation between the two services was difficult or impossible. Most\r\nof the naval air pilots knew little of the business of military\r\nreconnaissance; nor could the military observer be expected to recognize\r\nand identify enemy shipping.\r\n\r\nThe demand for squadrons to assist the land campaign seemed likely to be\r\ngreater than the supply, and on the 24th of August 1914 the Government\r\nhad approved the formation of two Royal Naval Air Service squadrons, to\r\nbe trained for military duties. The Admiralty took action at once, and\r\nthese two squadrons were formed, one at Fort Grange, the other at\r\nEastchurch, during the early days of October. They were only a few days\r\nold when news came that the army chiefs did not approve of the plan.\r\nWriting on the 17th of October 1914 Sir John French said that the\r\nefficiency of the Flying Corps for military purposes was principally due\r\nto its organization and training. 'It is therefore', he added, 'most\r\ndesirable that any reinforcements should be organized, trained, and\r\nequipped in exactly the same manner as the squadrons now in the field.\r\nOwing to the complete divergence between methods and equipment of the\r\nnaval and military air services, I do not consider that units of the\r\nRoyal Naval Air Service would be suitable as reinforcements to this\r\nforce.' Lieutenant-Colonel Brancker, in a minute on this letter, dated\r\nthe 22nd of October, suggested that the army should undertake all aerial\r\nwork with the expeditionary force abroad and with the mobile forces at\r\nhome, while the navy should undertake the aerial work for all fixed\r\ndefences at home. A few weeks later the Army Council, replying to the\r\noffer of the Admiralty, suggested that the best way for the Admiralty to\r\nhelp would be by handing over to the War Office the aeroplanes which\r\nwere being provided to the order of the Admiralty, so that the\r\nadditional military squadron might be the earlier completed. Lastly, on\r\nthe 2nd of December, Lieutenant-Colonel Brancker addressed an urgent\r\nappeal to the Air Department of the Admiralty. The squadrons with the\r\nBritish forces in the field, he said, were very seriously short of\r\naeroplanes. There was also a shortage of flying officers, especially for\r\nthe training of pilots at home. He suggested that the entire output of\r\nthe Avro factory, and all the Vickers fighters, should be placed at the\r\ndisposal of the War Office; that four Maurice Farmans under construction\r\nin Paris for the Admiralty should be delivered direct to the\r\nheadquarters of the Royal Flying Corps in France; and that any number up\r\nto twenty good pilots, and the same number of wireless operators, should\r\nbe lent by the Admiralty to the War Office. The Admiralty replied at\r\nonce that they were willing to hand over to the Army Council twelve\r\nVickers fighters and six Maurice Farman machines, and that they were\r\npreparing a squadron of eight Avro machines and four Sopwith scouts\r\nunder Squadron Commander Longmore, to proceed overseas about the middle\r\nof January, and to work under the orders of the officer commanding the\r\nMilitary Wing. On the 1st of January 1915 the War Office, after\r\nconsulting Sir David Henderson, refused this offer of a naval squadron.\r\n'It has been decided', wrote Lieutenant-Colonel Brancker, 'to send no\r\nfurther new aeroplane squadrons to join the Expeditionary Force until\r\nthe winter is over; the bad weather renders aerial reconnaissance\r\ndifficult, and we find that owing to the impossibility of protecting the\r\nmachine from deterioration it will be better to keep our new units at\r\nhome until conditions improve.' In the event about a hundred machines,\r\nand as many more American Curtiss machines, built and building, were\r\nturned over by the Admiralty to the War Office during the first year of\r\nthe war, but no further suggestion for the use of naval squadrons on the\r\nwestern front was made until March 1916; and it was not until October of\r\nthat year that the first complete naval squadron got to work as a\r\nself-contained unit under military command.\r\n\r\nService men will understand better than civilians the difficulties of a\r\nmixed service. Each of the great services has always been willing to\r\nhelp the other so long as it is allowed to preserve its own traditions\r\nintact. Their quarrels are lovers' quarrels, springing from a jealous\r\nmaintenance of separate individualities. Moreover, the war, during its\r\nearly course, was regarded by most civilians and most service men as\r\nlikely to be a short war. The attention of soldiers late in 1914 was\r\nconcentrated on the decision that was expected in the following spring.\r\nLord Kitchener's famous prediction of a three years' war was regarded as\r\na wise insurance against foolish over-confidence, but was not believed.\r\nThe officers responsible for the Flying Corps in France were concerned\r\nchiefly for the maintenance of that admirable little force in full\r\nefficiency. They suffered continually from a shortage of aeroplanes, and\r\nalthough their casualties had been far lighter than any one had\r\nanticipated, they had every reason to fear a shortage of flying\r\nofficers. Their first demand was not for new squadrons, but for a\r\nreserve of pilots and machines, to keep the existing squadrons in\r\nworking trim. It was only by degrees that the portentous dimensions of\r\nthe war began to be perceived--a war which, just before it ended, was\r\nemploying ninety-nine squadrons of British aeroplanes on the western\r\nfront alone.\r\n\r\nThe discovery, or rather the practical development, of new uses for\r\naircraft in war quickened the demand for additional squadrons and made\r\nit easier for the two branches of the air service to co-operate. As the\r\nwar progressed aerial fighting and bomb-dropping became more and more\r\nimportant. These were new arts, and required no special naval or\r\nmilitary training; they belonged to the air. When the Fokker fighting\r\nmonoplane appeared in strength on the western front in the early months\r\nof 1916, the losses of the Royal Flying Corps in reconnaissance and\r\nartillery observation became very heavy. It was then that the Admiralty\r\nwere again appealed to for help, and four Nieuport scouts, with pilots\r\nand mechanics, were dispatched from Eastchurch, arriving at the\r\naerodrome of No. 6 Squadron, at Abeele, between Cassel and Poperinghe,\r\non the 29th of March 1916. Before this time the pilots of the Royal\r\nFlying Corps in the Ypres salient had had only the barest acquaintance\r\nwith the pilots of the Naval Air Service at Dunkirk. Some of the earlier\r\nFlying Corps pilots had met those of the other service at the Central\r\nFlying School; some of the later pilots had had occasion to land at\r\nDunkirk and had been filled with admiration and envy when they were\r\nshown the machines and equipment belonging to the Naval Air Service.\r\nSometimes a naval pilot, flying a little south of his usual beat, would\r\ncome across a military pilot in the air, and the two would make some\r\ntoken of recognition. But the four naval Nieuport scouts of March 1916\r\nsent to the salient to help to meet the attacks of German fighting\r\nscouts were the first naval detachment to co-operate with the Royal\r\nFlying Corps in the field under military command. The experiment, though\r\nit lasted only for eighteen days, was a success. The naval officers and\r\nratings were treated royally, as guests, and there was complete harmony\r\nbetween the two services. The little Nieuport scouts brought reassurance\r\nto the lonely artillery pilots on the front, and had a happy effect on\r\nthe German fighting pilots, who were led to suspect the presence of a\r\nwhole new squadron of Nieuports. On the 16th of April No. 29 Fighting\r\nSquadron of the Royal Flying Corps, which had been delayed by accidents,\r\narrived at Abeele, and the naval machines returned to Dunkirk.\r\n\r\nThis experiment showed the way and encouraged fuller measures. During\r\nthe battles of the Somme, which began on the 1st of July 1916, the Royal\r\nFlying Corps maintained a resolute and continuous offensive over the\r\nenemy lines. They suffered very heavy casualties, at a time when\r\ntraining and construction at home, which were in process of development,\r\nwere unable to make good all the losses. Then the Admiralty, on the\r\nurgent appeal of the Army Council, agreed to detach from the Dunkirk\r\ncommand a complete squadron of eighteen fighting aeroplanes, under\r\nSquadron Commander G. M. Bromet, for temporary duty with the army. The\r\nsquadron consisted of six two-seater Sopwiths, six single-seater\r\nSopwiths, and six Nieuport scouts. They arrived at Vert Galand\r\naerodrome, which is situated eleven miles north of Amiens on the\r\nAmiens-Doullens road, on the 16th of October 1916. After three weeks\r\nspent in machine-gun practice and flights to learn the country, the\r\nfirst full day's work was done on the 9th of November. There were many\r\ncombats, and three enemy machines were driven down in a damaged\r\ncondition. This squadron continued to operate with the army in France.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of 1917 there were in France, working wholly with the\r\narmy, thirty-eight Royal Flying Corps squadrons; that is to say,\r\nnineteen artillery squadrons and nineteen fighting squadrons; and the\r\none fighting squadron belonging to the Royal Naval Air Service. It was\r\nanticipated that the Germans, who had appointed a single officer,\r\nGeneral von Hoeppner, to take charge of all their military aircraft, and\r\nhad produced several improved types of machine, would make a great\r\neffort in the spring of 1917 to recapture the air. To meet this effort\r\nmore fighting squadrons were needed. The machinery at home for the\r\nreinforcement of the Royal Flying Corps was working at high pressure,\r\nand could not at once supply the need. So an appeal was once more\r\naddressed to the Admiralty, who agreed to provide four more fighting\r\nsquadrons to be used on the western front. These squadrons made a\r\npunctual appearance, and during the earlier half of 1917 did magnificent\r\nwork in helping to maintain the British supremacy in the air. Naval\r\nSquadron No. 3, for instance, under Squadron Commander R. H. Mulock, was\r\nat work on the western front from the beginning of February to the\r\nmiddle of June. During this time it accounted for eighty enemy aircraft\r\nwith a loss of only nine machines missing, and provided highly respected\r\nescorts for photographic reconnaissances and bomb raids. From July 1917\r\nonwards the naval squadrons, having bridged the gap, were gradually\r\nreplaced by squadrons of the Royal Flying Corps, and were returned to\r\nDunkirk.\r\n\r\nThe loan of these squadrons naturally diminished the force available for\r\naerial operations under naval control, but the spirit in which the help\r\nwas given is well expressed in a letter of Wing Captain C. L. Lambe,\r\nwho was in command of the naval air forces at Dover and Dunkirk.\r\nWriting in August 1917 he points out the serious effects on the force\r\nunder his command of the wastage of pilots, but concludes: 'I would\r\nremark however that the loan of these squadrons to the Royal Flying\r\nCorps must have been of the greatest value to the Empire, since the\r\nofficial record issued by the Royal Flying Corps states that up to\r\nAugust 3rd, 1917, a hundred and twenty-one enemy machines have been\r\ndestroyed by naval squadrons, and two hundred and forty have been driven\r\ndown out of control.'\r\n\r\nWhen help was needed by the army, it was generously given by the navy,\r\nbut the difficulties which inevitably present themselves when the\r\nattempt is made to secure the smooth and efficient collaboration of two\r\nseparate forces cannot be solved by generous feeling. Most men are\r\nwilling to help their country, but a country's revenue cannot be raised\r\nby free gift. Without justice and certainty there can be no efficiency,\r\nand for justice and certainty law and regulation are required. The chief\r\nadministrative problem of the war in the air had its origin in the need\r\nfor a large measure of co-operation between the military and naval air\r\nforces. The repeated attempts to solve this problem, the problem of\r\nunity of control, by the establishment of successive Air Boards, and the\r\nachieved solution of it by the amalgamation in 1918 of the two services\r\nunder the control of an Air Ministry--these events took almost as long\r\nas the war to happen; indeed the story of them might truly be called the\r\nConstitutional History of the War in the Air. That story cannot be told\r\nhere; it shall be told at a later point, in connexion with the\r\nfoundation of the Royal Air Force. The method of government of the Royal\r\nFlying Corps has already been described; all that can fitly be attempted\r\nhere is a brief account of the government of the Royal Naval Air\r\nService, and the earlier vicissitudes of that government.\r\n\r\nThe union of the two wings of the Royal Flying Corps, that is to say, of\r\nthe original Naval and Military Wings, was a one-sided and imperfect\r\nunion, because the Royal Flying Corps, in its inception, was under the\r\ncontrol of the War Office. The naval officers who joined the Naval Wing\r\nremained under the control of the Admiralty, and before the war the\r\nAdmiralty had established an Air Department, with Captain Murray Sueter\r\nas its Director, to be responsible for the development of naval\r\naeronautics. But the Director was less happily situated than his\r\nmilitary counterpart, the Director-General of Military Aeronautics at\r\nthe War Office, who, it will be remembered, dealt at first hand with the\r\nSecretary of State for War. The Naval Director of the Air Department had\r\nless power and less independence. From the time of Mr. Samuel Pepys,\r\nthroughout the eighteenth century, and down to the year 1832, the navy\r\nhad been administered by the office of the Lord High Admiral, assisted\r\nby a Navy Board, which was composed, for the most part, of civilian\r\nmembers of Parliament. In 1832 the Navy Board was abolished, and the\r\nmodern Board of Admiralty was created to control the navy. The business\r\nof this Board was divided up among its various members. Finance fell to\r\nthe Parliamentary Secretary; works, buildings, contracts, and dockyard\r\nbusiness were the portion of the Civil Lords; while all kinds of service\r\nbusiness, that is to say, preparation for war, distribution of the\r\nfleet, training, equipment, and the like, were assigned to one or other\r\nof the Sea Lords. When the Air Department was formed to take charge of\r\nthe Naval Wing of the Royal Flying Corps, its Director was not only\r\ngenerally responsible to the Board of Admiralty, he was responsible to\r\neach of the Sea Lords in matters connected with that Sea Lord's\r\ndepartment. This divided responsibility, which, by old custom, works\r\nwell enough in a body with established traditions, like the navy, was\r\nnot a good scheme for controlling the unprecedented duties, or for\r\nencouraging the unexampled activities, of an air force.\r\n\r\nWhen the Naval Wing of the Royal Flying Corps was first established, in\r\n1912, H.M.S. _Hermes_, under the command of Captain G. W. Vivian, was\r\ncommissioned as its headquarters. During the following year naval air\r\nstations came into being at the Isle of Grain, at Calshot, Felixstowe,\r\nYarmouth, and Cromarty, and in December 1913 the duties of the captain\r\nof the _Hermes_ were taken over by Captain F. R. Scarlett, who was given\r\nthe newly created post of Inspecting Captain of Aircraft, with\r\nheadquarters at the Central Air Office, Sheerness. At the time of the\r\noutbreak of war the Royal Naval Air Service was administered by the\r\nAdmiralty, and consisted of the Air Department at Whitehall, the Central\r\nAir Office at Sheerness, the Royal Naval Flying School at Eastchurch,\r\nthe various naval air stations, and such aircraft as were available for\r\nnaval purposes. The Sheerness office was under the Nore command, and the\r\nInspecting Captain of Aircraft, who took his instructions from the\r\nDirector of the Air Department, was also responsible to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Home Fleets in all matters relating to\r\naircraft operations with the main fleet.\r\n\r\nThe coming of the war soon multiplied air stations as well as aircraft;\r\ninland stations were established at Hendon, Chingford, Wormwood Scrubbs,\r\nand Roehampton; squadrons were dispatched abroad, and seaplane ships\r\nwere commissioned; so that efficient control by the Nore command was no\r\nlonger possible. In February 1915 the Admiralty decided that the whole\r\nof the Royal Naval Air Service should be forthwith placed under the\r\norders of the Director of the Air Department, who was to be solely\r\nresponsible to the Board of Admiralty. The Central Air Office was\r\nabolished, and Captain Scarlett was appointed to the staff of the Air\r\nDepartment to carry out inspection duties.\r\n\r\nWhen this decision took effect in Admiralty Weekly Orders, certain\r\npoints of difficulty were at once raised by the Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe Nore. 'Is the personnel of the air stations', he asked, 'to be\r\nsubject to local Port Orders? I can hardly imagine that their Lordships\r\nintend otherwise. There are 77 officers and 530 men, including 94 naval\r\nratings, in the three air establishments at present in my command\r\n(Eastchurch, Grain, and Kingsnorth), and it is understood that these\r\nnumbers will shortly be increased by the personnel of three additional\r\nair stations (Clacton, Westgate, and Maidstone).' Further, he asked\r\nwhether the Commander-in-Chief was to remain the controlling authority\r\nwith regard to punishments; and he added, 'I strongly urge the\r\nre-establishment of some Central Air Authority in the port under my\r\ncommand with whom I can deal on defence and other important matters\r\nwithout reference to the individual air stations, which may often be\r\ncommanded by officers of small naval experience to whom the naval aspect\r\nof the situation may not especially appeal.'\r\n\r\nIt was felt in the air service that owing to the technical nature of the\r\nwork the question of punishments should not be relegated to any one\r\noutside the air service. The Commander-in-Chief of the Nore had invoked\r\nthe King's Regulations, so the question was referred to the naval law\r\nbranch of the Admiralty, which, in April 1915, replied that 'the\r\ndiscipline of the air service is governed entirely by the King's\r\nRegulations, which provide that the powers conferred upon commanding\r\nofficers by the Naval Discipline Act shall be subject to the approval of\r\na Flag officer whose flag is flying or the Senior Naval Officer.... As a\r\nmatter of fact the Director of the Air Department has no disciplinary\r\npower under the Naval Discipline Act, and the reference of warrants to\r\nhim would neither be in accordance with the King's Regulations nor the\r\nNaval Discipline Act.'\r\n\r\nThis verdict threw the organization of the Royal Naval Air Service once\r\nmore into the melting-pot. The question of discipline was at the root of\r\nthe whole matter. The navy were not willing to hand over the control of\r\ndiscipline to a body which, though it was called the Royal Naval Air\r\nService, was much looser in discipline than the Royal Navy. The causes\r\nof this comparative laxity are easily intelligible. When the war came,\r\nthe need for new pilots was pressing; the training accommodation at the\r\nCentral Flying School and at Eastchurch was wholly inadequate; so the\r\nAdmiralty had at once made arrangements for entering officers direct\r\nfrom civilian life, and for training them at civilian schools of\r\naviation, such as the schools at Brooklands, Hendon, and Eastbourne. The\r\nimportant thing at the outbreak of war was to get officers who could fly\r\na machine, and to get them quickly. Of professional training in naval\r\nknowledge and naval discipline there was perforce little. The spirit of\r\nadventure brought many youths at a very early age into the Naval Air\r\nService; some of them were entered as commissioned officers, and were\r\npaid fourteen shillings a day at an age at which the regular sea service\r\nofficer was being paid one shilling and ninepence a day, less threepence\r\nfor the naval instructor. It is not to be wondered at that the high\r\nspirits of some of these untrained youths, and their festive behaviour,\r\nexposed them to the criticism of older officers who cared for the high\r\ntraditions of the navy. The expansion of the Naval Air Service was too\r\nrapid to admit of that slow maturing process which makes a good sailor.\r\nWhen, at the end of May 1915, Mr. Winston Churchill vacated his\r\nappointment as First Lord of the Admiralty, he remarked on the rapid\r\nexpansion of the service during his period of office. 'At the beginning\r\nof hostilities', he says, 'there were under a hundred officers and six\r\nhundred men. Most of these were transferred from the Navy proper, a\r\nsmall percentage only being civilians. At present there are over fifteen\r\nhundred officers and eleven thousand men.... We had at the beginning of\r\nthe war a total of sixty-four aeroplanes and seaplanes. This of course\r\nrepresents a very minute proportion of our present numbers, of which all\r\nthat I can publicly say is that they total more than one thousand.'\r\n\r\nDuring the first winter of the war a short course in gunnery was\r\narranged for young officers at the naval gunnery school at Whale Island,\r\nPortsmouth, where they were instructed also in drill, discipline, and\r\nthe handling of men. This was a beginning, but it was not enough. The\r\npioneers of the Naval Air Service had had an uphill task; they had\r\nworked untiringly in the cause of naval aeronautics, to achieve progress\r\nin the new art, and to get recognition for it from the Sea Lords. The\r\nrecognition, when it came at last, was overwhelming. The navy claimed\r\nthe Royal Naval Air Service as its own, and absorbed it into itself. The\r\nimmediate motive for this was disciplinary, but the thing was a\r\ncompliment, none the less, to the work of the air service. In the summer\r\nof 1915 the German submarine menace in the Channel became serious, and\r\nthe officer in command of the Dover Patrol, who was responsible for the\r\nStraits, knew that for the work to be done from his bases at Dover and\r\nDunkirk aircraft were essential.\r\n\r\nIn July the whole question was brought before the Board of Admiralty,\r\nand regulations for the reorganization of the Royal Naval Air Service\r\nwere approved, to take effect on the 1st of August. These regulations\r\nare explicit and clear. 'The Royal Naval Air Service' (so they begin)\r\n'is to be regarded in all respects as an integral part of the Royal\r\nNavy, and in future the various air stations will be under the general\r\norders of the Commander-in-Chief or Senior Naval Officers in whose\r\ndistrict they are situated.\r\n\r\n'The Commander-in-Chief or Senior Naval Officer will visit the stations\r\nwithin his command or district from time to time, or depute a suitable\r\nofficer to visit them on his behalf, to ensure that the discipline of\r\nthe station is maintained.... Copies of reports on operations are to be\r\nforwarded direct to the Admiralty. It will be the duty of the Director\r\nof the Air Department to visit the various air stations from time to\r\ntime ... with a view to ensuring that the technical training of the\r\npersonnel is being carried out as laid down by their Lordships, and that\r\nthe station is efficiently organized and equipped in respect to works\r\nand materiel.'\r\n\r\nThese are the main provisions of the new orders. The grouping of the air\r\nstations (which by this time were more than fifty in number) under the\r\nvarious commands was given in detail. The detachments stationed at\r\nDunkirk and elsewhere in France and Belgium were put, for disciplinary\r\npurposes, under the orders of the Rear-Admiral, Dover. The inland\r\nstations at Hendon, Chingford, Wormwood Scrubbs, and Roehampton were put\r\nimmediately under the Admiralty. Sweeping changes followed in\r\nappointments. The post of Director of the Air Department was abolished,\r\nand Commodore Murray Sueter was placed in charge of the construction\r\nsection of the remodelled department. An officer of flag rank,\r\nRear-Admiral C. L. Vaughan-Lee, was given the newly created post of\r\nDirector of Air Services. A senior Naval Air Service officer, Wing\r\nCommander C. L. Lambe, R.N., who had been captain of the _Hermes_, was\r\nappointed to command the air patrols at Dover and Dunkirk, under the\r\norders of Vice-Admiral R. H. Bacon. Other changes which followed were so\r\nnumerous that in effect a new service was formed. When the Air\r\nDepartment was reorganized in the spring of 1916, it was divided into\r\ntwo sections--Administration and Construction. Each of these sections\r\nincluded a considerable diversity of business, which was classified, and\r\nplaced under the separate control of eight responsible officers. Of\r\nthese eight only two--Squadron Commander Clark Hall, who was responsible\r\nfor aeroplane and seaplane design, and Squadron Commander W. Briggs, who\r\nwas responsible for engines--were officers of the original Royal Naval\r\nAir Service. Most of the newly appointed administrative officers had no\r\nprevious knowledge of aircraft or aircraft operations; what they were\r\nchosen for was their power of organization, their strict sense of\r\ndiscipline, their untiring energy, and their pride in the ancient\r\nservice to which they belonged. The senior naval officer who was\r\ninexperienced in the air was promoted over the heads of the pioneers of\r\nnaval aviation who were junior in the navy.\r\n\r\nThere is no unmixed good on earth. The debate between discipline and\r\nprogress can never be settled dogmatically one way or the other. Those\r\nwho have to lead men into battle are agreed that without discipline\r\nprogress is useless. A crowd of undrilled men of science could not stand\r\nthe push of a platoon of common soldiers. On the other hand, it is\r\nall-important that the higher command in war shall be susceptible to\r\nscience, and it has been maintained, not without evidence, that the life\r\nof discipline and loyalty which procures promotion in a public service\r\ndoes not usually increase susceptibility to science.\r\n\r\nThe immediate practical advantages which were aimed at by the\r\nreorganizers of the Naval Air Service were attained. In place of the old\r\nscattered training stations a central training depot was set up at\r\nCranwell in Lincolnshire, and a complete system for the instruction and\r\ngraduation of pupils was instituted. A designs department was set up at\r\nWhitehall; the airship service was taken in hand and developed for\r\nanti-submarine patrol work. What may be called the most important unit\r\nof the Royal Naval Air Service was created by the amalgamation under\r\nWing Commander Lambe of the squadrons which had their bases at Dunkirk\r\nand Dover. This unit, later in the war, became the famous Fifth Group,\r\nunder the same command. The arrangements made at the time of change\r\ncontinued in force up to the time of the union of the military and naval\r\nair services, and progress was continuous. In January 1916 the Admiralty\r\napproved that the overseas establishment of the Royal Naval Air Service\r\nshould have three wings, each wing to have two squadrons, and each\r\nsquadron two flights, with six machines to a flight. One of these wings\r\nwas based at Dunkirk; for the others two new aerodromes were\r\nestablished, in the spring of 1916, at Coudekerque and Petite Synthe,\r\nand were occupied, the first by No. 5 Wing, under Squadron Commander\r\nSpenser Grey, the other by No. 4 Wing, under Wing Commander C. L.\r\nCourtney, R.N. No. 5 Wing was specially trained for the work of\r\nlong-distance bombing.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning the Naval Air Service had set their heart on the\r\nfitting out of big bombing raids against distant German centres--Essen,\r\nor Berlin. It was a grief to them, when the war ended, that Berlin had\r\nsuffered no damage from the air. The success of their early raids on\r\nDuesseldorf and Friedrichshafen naturally strengthened their desire to\r\ncarry out more destructive raids over more important centres. In this\r\nway, they believed, they could best help the army. This idea inspired\r\nsome of the documents drawn up by Mr. Winston Churchill while he was\r\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty. When in February 1916 Rear-Admiral\r\nVaughan-Lee submitted to the Admiralty his scheme for the employment of\r\nthe reorganized Royal Naval Air Service the same idea dominated his\r\nadvices. 'I consider', his report concludes, 'that we should develop\r\nlong-distance offensive work as much as possible.' The preference shown\r\nby the navy, in their orders from the makers, for powerful bomb-carrying\r\nmachines tells the same story. When the navy set about carrying out this\r\npolicy by the formation of a special force, called No. 3 Wing, at\r\nLuxeuil, for the express purpose of making long-distance raids over\r\nGerman munition centres, the army, which was preparing its great effort\r\non the Somme front, and which needed more and yet more machines for the\r\nimmediate purposes of the campaign, protested against the use of British\r\naircraft for what seemed to them a luxury in comparison with their own\r\ndire needs. So the Luxeuil Wing was, for the time, broken up; but the\r\nidea took shape again later when the Independent Force came into being.\r\n\r\nThe sound doctrine on this matter is laid down in General Trenchard's\r\nreports, which shall be given hereafter. Yet it may be admitted, without\r\nprejudice to that doctrine, that if bombing raids had been possible over\r\nEssen and Berlin their effect would have been very great. The Germans\r\nspent not a little effort on their raids over London, and hoped for the\r\nweakening or shattering of the British war temper as a consequence of\r\nthose raids. Their belief in frightfulness was a belief in fright. They\r\njudged others by themselves. No people on earth, it may readily be\r\nadmitted, can maintain the efficiency of its war activities under the\r\nregular intensive bombing of its centres of population; but the Germans,\r\nduring the greater part of the war, knew nothing of this fierce trial,\r\nand their trust in their army would have been terribly weakened if that\r\narmy had proved to be no sure shield for the quiet and security of civil\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nSuch differences as arose between the British naval and military\r\nauthorities concerning the use of aircraft in the war were, for the\r\nreasons that have been given, not easily avoidable. They were ultimately\r\ncomposed by the union of the military and naval air forces under a\r\nsingle control, and the emergence of a new air force.\r\n\r\nWars have for many centuries been conducted on land and on sea. A third\r\nand larger theatre has now been found for them. The air flows over both\r\nland and sea; more than either land or sea it is the place of vision,\r\nand of speed and freedom of movement. What we of this generation are\r\nwitnessing is a process whereby the air shall come into its own. It will\r\nbecome the great highway for the traffic of peace; and in war, which\r\ncannot be abolished while man has interests that are dearer to him than\r\nhis own comfort and safety, the forces of the air will be, not a\r\nlate-found timid auxiliary to the forces of the land and of the sea, but\r\ntheir overseer and their director.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTED IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nAT THE OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The War in the Air; Vol. 1, by Walter Raleigh",
