CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CUSTOM-HOUSE\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY TO “THE SCARLET LETTER”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a little remarkable, that—though disinclined to talk overmuch of\r\nmyself and my affairs at the fireside, and to my personal friends—an\r\nautobiographical impulse should twice in my life have taken possession\r\nof me, in addressing the public. The first time was three or four years\r\nsince, when I favoured the reader—inexcusably, and for no earthly\r\nreason that either the indulgent reader or the intrusive author could\r\nimagine—with a description of my way of life in the deep quietude of an\r\nOld Manse. And now—because, beyond my deserts, I was happy enough to\r\nfind a listener or two on the former occasion—I again seize the public\r\nby the button, and talk of my three years’ experience in a\r\nCustom-House. The example of the famous “P. P., Clerk of this Parish,”\r\nwas never more faithfully followed. The truth seems to be, however,\r\nthat when he casts his leaves forth upon the wind, the author\r\naddresses, not the many who will fling aside his volume, or never take\r\nit up, but the few who will understand him better than most of his\r\nschoolmates or lifemates. Some authors, indeed, do far more than this,\r\nand indulge themselves in such confidential depths of revelation as\r\ncould fittingly be addressed only and exclusively to the one heart and\r\nmind of perfect sympathy; as if the printed book, thrown at large on\r\nthe wide world, were certain to find out the divided segment of the\r\nwriter’s own nature, and complete his circle of existence by bringing\r\nhim into communion with it. It is scarcely decorous, however, to speak\r\nall, even where we speak impersonally. But, as thoughts are frozen and\r\nutterance benumbed, unless the speaker stand in some true relation with\r\nhis audience, it may be pardonable to imagine that a friend, a kind and\r\napprehensive, though not the closest friend, is listening to our talk;\r\nand then, a native reserve being thawed by this genial consciousness,\r\nwe may prate of the circumstances that lie around us, and even of\r\nourself, but still keep the inmost Me behind its veil. To this extent,\r\nand within these limits, an author, methinks, may be autobiographical,\r\nwithout violating either the reader’s rights or his own.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, likewise, that this Custom-House sketch has a certain\r\npropriety, of a kind always recognised in literature, as explaining how\r\na large portion of the following pages came into my possession, and as\r\noffering proofs of the authenticity of a narrative therein contained.\r\nThis, in fact—a desire to put myself in my true position as editor, or\r\nvery little more, of the most prolix among the tales that make up my\r\nvolume—this, and no other, is my true reason for assuming a personal\r\nrelation with the public. In accomplishing the main purpose, it has\r\nappeared allowable, by a few extra touches, to give a faint\r\nrepresentation of a mode of life not heretofore described, together\r\nwith some of the characters that move in it, among whom the author\r\nhappened to make one.\r\n\r\nIn my native town of Salem, at the head of what, half a century ago, in\r\nthe days of old King Derby, was a bustling wharf—but which is now\r\nburdened with decayed wooden warehouses, and exhibits few or no\r\nsymptoms of commercial life; except, perhaps, a bark or brig, half-way\r\ndown its melancholy length, discharging hides; or, nearer at hand, a\r\nNova Scotia schooner, pitching out her cargo of firewood—at the head, I\r\nsay, of this dilapidated wharf, which the tide often overflows, and\r\nalong which, at the base and in the rear of the row of buildings, the\r\ntrack of many languid years is seen in a border of unthrifty\r\ngrass—here, with a view from its front windows adown this not very\r\nenlivening prospect, and thence across the harbour, stands a spacious\r\nedifice of brick. From the loftiest point of its roof, during precisely\r\nthree and a half hours of each forenoon, floats or droops, in breeze or\r\ncalm, the banner of the republic; but with the thirteen stripes turned\r\nvertically, instead of horizontally, and thus indicating that a civil,\r\nand not a military, post of Uncle Sam’s government is here established.\r\nIts front is ornamented with a portico of half-a-dozen wooden pillars,\r\nsupporting a balcony, beneath which a flight of wide granite steps\r\ndescends towards the street. Over the entrance hovers an enormous\r\nspecimen of the American eagle, with outspread wings, a shield before\r\nher breast, and, if I recollect aright, a bunch of intermingled\r\nthunderbolts and barbed arrows in each claw. With the customary\r\ninfirmity of temper that characterizes this unhappy fowl, she appears\r\nby the fierceness of her beak and eye, and the general truculency of\r\nher attitude, to threaten mischief to the inoffensive community; and\r\nespecially to warn all citizens careful of their safety against\r\nintruding on the premises which she overshadows with her wings.\r\nNevertheless, vixenly as she looks, many people are seeking at this\r\nvery moment to shelter themselves under the wing of the federal eagle;\r\nimagining, I presume, that her bosom has all the softness and snugness\r\nof an eiderdown pillow. But she has no great tenderness even in her\r\nbest of moods, and, sooner or later—oftener soon than late—is apt to\r\nfling off her nestlings with a scratch of her claw, a dab of her beak,\r\nor a rankling wound from her barbed arrows.\r\n\r\nThe pavement round about the above-described edifice—which we may as\r\nwell name at once as the Custom-House of the port—has grass enough\r\ngrowing in its chinks to show that it has not, of late days, been worn\r\nby any multitudinous resort of business. In some months of the year,\r\nhowever, there often chances a forenoon when affairs move onward with a\r\nlivelier tread. Such occasions might remind the elderly citizen of that\r\nperiod, before the last war with England, when Salem was a port by\r\nitself; not scorned, as she is now, by her own merchants and\r\nship-owners, who permit her wharves to crumble to ruin while their\r\nventures go to swell, needlessly and imperceptibly, the mighty flood of\r\ncommerce at New York or Boston. On some such morning, when three or\r\nfour vessels happen to have arrived at once usually from Africa or\r\nSouth America—or to be on the verge of their departure thitherward,\r\nthere is a sound of frequent feet passing briskly up and down the\r\ngranite steps. Here, before his own wife has greeted him, you may greet\r\nthe sea-flushed ship-master, just in port, with his vessel’s papers\r\nunder his arm in a tarnished tin box. Here, too, comes his owner,\r\ncheerful, sombre, gracious or in the sulks, accordingly as his scheme\r\nof the now accomplished voyage has been realized in merchandise that\r\nwill readily be turned to gold, or has buried him under a bulk of\r\nincommodities such as nobody will care to rid him of. Here,\r\nlikewise—the germ of the wrinkle-browed, grizzly-bearded, careworn\r\nmerchant—we have the smart young clerk, who gets the taste of traffic\r\nas a wolf-cub does of blood, and already sends adventures in his\r\nmaster’s ships, when he had better be sailing mimic boats upon a\r\nmill-pond. Another figure in the scene is the outward-bound sailor, in\r\nquest of a protection; or the recently arrived one, pale and feeble,\r\nseeking a passport to the hospital. Nor must we forget the captains of\r\nthe rusty little schooners that bring firewood from the British\r\nprovinces; a rough-looking set of tarpaulins, without the alertness of\r\nthe Yankee aspect, but contributing an item of no slight importance to\r\nour decaying trade.\r\n\r\nCluster all these individuals together, as they sometimes were, with\r\nother miscellaneous ones to diversify the group, and, for the time\r\nbeing, it made the Custom-House a stirring scene. More frequently,\r\nhowever, on ascending the steps, you would discern— in the entry if it\r\nwere summer time, or in their appropriate rooms if wintry or inclement\r\nweathers—a row of venerable figures, sitting in old-fashioned chairs,\r\nwhich were tipped on their hind legs back against the wall. Oftentimes\r\nthey were asleep, but occasionally might be heard talking together, in\r\nvoices between a speech and a snore, and with that lack of energy that\r\ndistinguishes the occupants of alms-houses, and all other human beings\r\nwho depend for subsistence on charity, on monopolized labour, or\r\nanything else but their own independent exertions. These old\r\ngentlemen—seated, like Matthew at the receipt of custom, but not very\r\nliable to be summoned thence, like him, for apostolic errands—were\r\nCustom-House officers.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, on the left hand as you enter the front door, is a certain\r\nroom or office, about fifteen feet square, and of a lofty height, with\r\ntwo of its arched windows commanding a view of the aforesaid\r\ndilapidated wharf, and the third looking across a narrow lane, and\r\nalong a portion of Derby Street. All three give glimpses of the shops\r\nof grocers, block-makers, slop-sellers, and ship-chandlers, around the\r\ndoors of which are generally to be seen, laughing and gossiping,\r\nclusters of old salts, and such other wharf-rats as haunt the Wapping\r\nof a seaport. The room itself is cobwebbed, and dingy with old paint;\r\nits floor is strewn with grey sand, in a fashion that has elsewhere\r\nfallen into long disuse; and it is easy to conclude, from the general\r\nslovenliness of the place, that this is a sanctuary into which\r\nwomankind, with her tools of magic, the broom and mop, has very\r\ninfrequent access. In the way of furniture, there is a stove with a\r\nvoluminous funnel; an old pine desk with a three-legged stool beside\r\nit; two or three wooden-bottom chairs, exceedingly decrepit and infirm;\r\nand—not to forget the library—on some shelves, a score or two of\r\nvolumes of the Acts of Congress, and a bulky Digest of the Revenue\r\nlaws. A tin pipe ascends through the ceiling, and forms a medium of\r\nvocal communication with other parts of the edifice. And here, some six\r\nmonths ago—pacing from corner to corner, or lounging on the long-legged\r\nstool, with his elbow on the desk, and his eyes wandering up and down\r\nthe columns of the morning newspaper—you might have recognised,\r\nhonoured reader, the same individual who welcomed you into his cheery\r\nlittle study, where the sunshine glimmered so pleasantly through the\r\nwillow branches on the western side of the Old Manse. But now, should\r\nyou go thither to seek him, you would inquire in vain for the Locofoco\r\nSurveyor. The besom of reform hath swept him out of office, and a\r\nworthier successor wears his dignity and pockets his emoluments.\r\n\r\nThis old town of Salem—my native place, though I have dwelt much away\r\nfrom it both in boyhood and maturer years—possesses, or did possess, a\r\nhold on my affection, the force of which I have never realized during\r\nmy seasons of actual residence here. Indeed, so far as its physical\r\naspect is concerned, with its flat, unvaried surface, covered chiefly\r\nwith wooden houses, few or none of which pretend to architectural\r\nbeauty—its irregularity, which is neither picturesque nor quaint, but\r\nonly tame—its long and lazy street, lounging wearisomely through the\r\nwhole extent of the peninsula, with Gallows Hill and New Guinea at one\r\nend, and a view of the alms-house at the other—such being the features\r\nof my native town, it would be quite as reasonable to form a\r\nsentimental attachment to a disarranged checker-board. And yet, though\r\ninvariably happiest elsewhere, there is within me a feeling for Old\r\nSalem, which, in lack of a better phrase, I must be content to call\r\naffection. The sentiment is probably assignable to the deep and aged\r\nroots which my family has stuck into the soil. It is now nearly two\r\ncenturies and a quarter since the original Briton, the earliest\r\nemigrant of my name, made his appearance in the wild and\r\nforest-bordered settlement which has since become a city. And here his\r\ndescendants have been born and died, and have mingled their earthly\r\nsubstance with the soil, until no small portion of it must necessarily\r\nbe akin to the mortal frame wherewith, for a little while, I walk the\r\nstreets. In part, therefore, the attachment which I speak of is the\r\nmere sensuous sympathy of dust for dust. Few of my countrymen can know\r\nwhat it is; nor, as frequent transplantation is perhaps better for the\r\nstock, need they consider it desirable to know.\r\n\r\nBut the sentiment has likewise its moral quality. The figure of that\r\nfirst ancestor, invested by family tradition with a dim and dusky\r\ngrandeur, was present to my boyish imagination as far back as I can\r\nremember. It still haunts me, and induces a sort of home-feeling with\r\nthe past, which I scarcely claim in reference to the present phase of\r\nthe town. I seem to have a stronger claim to a residence here on\r\naccount of this grave, bearded, sable-cloaked, and steeple-crowned\r\nprogenitor—who came so early, with his Bible and his sword, and trode\r\nthe unworn street with such a stately port, and made so large a figure,\r\nas a man of war and peace—a stronger claim than for myself, whose name\r\nis seldom heard and my face hardly known. He was a soldier, legislator,\r\njudge; he was a ruler in the Church; he had all the Puritanic traits,\r\nboth good and evil. He was likewise a bitter persecutor; as witness the\r\nQuakers, who have remembered him in their histories, and relate an\r\nincident of his hard severity towards a woman of their sect, which will\r\nlast longer, it is to be feared, than any record of his better deeds,\r\nalthough these were many. His son, too, inherited the persecuting\r\nspirit, and made himself so conspicuous in the martyrdom of the\r\nwitches, that their blood may fairly be said to have left a stain upon\r\nhim. So deep a stain, indeed, that his dry old bones, in the\r\nCharter-street burial-ground, must still retain it, if they have not\r\ncrumbled utterly to dust! I know not whether these ancestors of mine\r\nbethought themselves to repent, and ask pardon of Heaven for their\r\ncruelties; or whether they are now groaning under the heavy\r\nconsequences of them in another state of being. At all events, I, the\r\npresent writer, as their representative, hereby take shame upon myself\r\nfor their sakes, and pray that any curse incurred by them—as I have\r\nheard, and as the dreary and unprosperous condition of the race, for\r\nmany a long year back, would argue to exist—may be now and henceforth\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, however, either of these stern and black-browed Puritans\r\nwould have thought it quite a sufficient retribution for his sins that,\r\nafter so long a lapse of years, the old trunk of the family tree, with\r\nso much venerable moss upon it, should have borne, as its topmost\r\nbough, an idler like myself. No aim that I have ever cherished would\r\nthey recognise as laudable; no success of mine—if my life, beyond its\r\ndomestic scope, had ever been brightened by success—would they deem\r\notherwise than worthless, if not positively disgraceful. “What is he?”\r\nmurmurs one grey shadow of my forefathers to the other. “A writer of\r\nstory books! What kind of business in life—what mode of glorifying God,\r\nor being serviceable to mankind in his day and generation—may that be?\r\nWhy, the degenerate fellow might as well have been a fiddler!” Such are\r\nthe compliments bandied between my great grandsires and myself, across\r\nthe gulf of time! And yet, let them scorn me as they will, strong\r\ntraits of their nature have intertwined themselves with mine.\r\n\r\nPlanted deep, in the town’s earliest infancy and childhood, by these\r\ntwo earnest and energetic men, the race has ever since subsisted here;\r\nalways, too, in respectability; never, so far as I have known,\r\ndisgraced by a single unworthy member; but seldom or never, on the\r\nother hand, after the first two generations, performing any memorable\r\ndeed, or so much as putting forward a claim to public notice.\r\nGradually, they have sunk almost out of sight; as old houses, here and\r\nthere about the streets, get covered half-way to the eaves by the\r\naccumulation of new soil. From father to son, for above a hundred\r\nyears, they followed the sea; a grey-headed shipmaster, in each\r\ngeneration, retiring from the quarter-deck to the homestead, while a\r\nboy of fourteen took the hereditary place before the mast, confronting\r\nthe salt spray and the gale which had blustered against his sire and\r\ngrandsire. The boy, also in due time, passed from the forecastle to the\r\ncabin, spent a tempestuous manhood, and returned from his\r\nworld-wanderings, to grow old, and die, and mingle his dust with the\r\nnatal earth. This long connexion of a family with one spot, as its\r\nplace of birth and burial, creates a kindred between the human being\r\nand the locality, quite independent of any charm in the scenery or\r\nmoral circumstances that surround him. It is not love but instinct. The\r\nnew inhabitant—who came himself from a foreign land, or whose father or\r\ngrandfather came—has little claim to be called a Salemite; he has no\r\nconception of the oyster-like tenacity with which an old settler, over\r\nwhom his third century is creeping, clings to the spot where his\r\nsuccessive generations have been embedded. It is no matter that the\r\nplace is joyless for him; that he is weary of the old wooden houses,\r\nthe mud and dust, the dead level of site and sentiment, the chill east\r\nwind, and the chillest of social atmospheres;—all these, and whatever\r\nfaults besides he may see or imagine, are nothing to the purpose. The\r\nspell survives, and just as powerfully as if the natal spot were an\r\nearthly paradise. So has it been in my case. I felt it almost as a\r\ndestiny to make Salem my home; so that the mould of features and cast\r\nof character which had all along been familiar here—ever, as one\r\nrepresentative of the race lay down in the grave, another assuming, as\r\nit were, his sentry-march along the main street—might still in my\r\nlittle day be seen and recognised in the old town. Nevertheless, this\r\nvery sentiment is an evidence that the connexion, which has become an\r\nunhealthy one, should at last be severed. Human nature will not\r\nflourish, any more than a potato, if it be planted and re-planted, for\r\ntoo long a series of generations, in the same worn-out soil. My\r\nchildren have had other birth-places, and, so far as their fortunes may\r\nbe within my control, shall strike their roots into unaccustomed earth.\r\n\r\nOn emerging from the Old Manse, it was chiefly this strange, indolent,\r\nunjoyous attachment for my native town that brought me to fill a place\r\nin Uncle Sam’s brick edifice, when I might as well, or better, have\r\ngone somewhere else. My doom was on me. It was not the first time, nor\r\nthe second, that I had gone away—as it seemed, permanently—but yet\r\nreturned, like the bad halfpenny, or as if Salem were for me the\r\ninevitable centre of the universe. So, one fine morning I ascended the\r\nflight of granite steps, with the President’s commission in my pocket,\r\nand was introduced to the corps of gentlemen who were to aid me in my\r\nweighty responsibility as chief executive officer of the Custom-House.\r\n\r\nI doubt greatly—or, rather, I do not doubt at all—whether any public\r\nfunctionary of the United States, either in the civil or military line,\r\nhas ever had such a patriarchal body of veterans under his orders as\r\nmyself. The whereabouts of the Oldest Inhabitant was at once settled\r\nwhen I looked at them. For upwards of twenty years before this epoch,\r\nthe independent position of the Collector had kept the Salem\r\nCustom-House out of the whirlpool of political vicissitude, which makes\r\nthe tenure of office generally so fragile. A soldier—New England’s most\r\ndistinguished soldier—he stood firmly on the pedestal of his gallant\r\nservices; and, himself secure in the wise liberality of the successive\r\nadministrations through which he had held office, he had been the\r\nsafety of his subordinates in many an hour of danger and heart-quake.\r\nGeneral Miller was radically conservative; a man over whose kindly\r\nnature habit had no slight influence; attaching himself strongly to\r\nfamiliar faces, and with difficulty moved to change, even when change\r\nmight have brought unquestionable improvement. Thus, on taking charge\r\nof my department, I found few but aged men. They were ancient\r\nsea-captains, for the most part, who, after being tossed on every sea,\r\nand standing up sturdily against life’s tempestuous blast, had finally\r\ndrifted into this quiet nook, where, with little to disturb them,\r\nexcept the periodical terrors of a Presidential election, they one and\r\nall acquired a new lease of existence. Though by no means less liable\r\nthan their fellow-men to age and infirmity, they had evidently some\r\ntalisman or other that kept death at bay. Two or three of their number,\r\nas I was assured, being gouty and rheumatic, or perhaps bed-ridden,\r\nnever dreamed of making their appearance at the Custom-House during a\r\nlarge part of the year; but, after a torpid winter, would creep out\r\ninto the warm sunshine of May or June, go lazily about what they termed\r\nduty, and, at their own leisure and convenience, betake themselves to\r\nbed again. I must plead guilty to the charge of abbreviating the\r\nofficial breath of more than one of these venerable servants of the\r\nrepublic. They were allowed, on my representation, to rest from their\r\narduous labours, and soon afterwards—as if their sole principle of life\r\nhad been zeal for their country’s service—as I verily believe it\r\nwas—withdrew to a better world. It is a pious consolation to me that,\r\nthrough my interference, a sufficient space was allowed them for\r\nrepentance of the evil and corrupt practices into which, as a matter of\r\ncourse, every Custom-House officer must be supposed to fall. Neither\r\nthe front nor the back entrance of the Custom-House opens on the road\r\nto Paradise.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of my officers were Whigs. It was well for their\r\nvenerable brotherhood that the new Surveyor was not a politician, and\r\nthough a faithful Democrat in principle, neither received nor held his\r\noffice with any reference to political services. Had it been\r\notherwise—had an active politician been put into this influential post,\r\nto assume the easy task of making head against a Whig Collector, whose\r\ninfirmities withheld him from the personal administration of his\r\noffice—hardly a man of the old corps would have drawn the breath of\r\nofficial life within a month after the exterminating angel had come up\r\nthe Custom-House steps. According to the received code in such matters,\r\nit would have been nothing short of duty, in a politician, to bring\r\nevery one of those white heads under the axe of the guillotine. It was\r\nplain enough to discern that the old fellows dreaded some such\r\ndiscourtesy at my hands. It pained, and at the same time amused me, to\r\nbehold the terrors that attended my advent, to see a furrowed cheek,\r\nweather-beaten by half a century of storm, turn ashy pale at the glance\r\nof so harmless an individual as myself; to detect, as one or another\r\naddressed me, the tremor of a voice which, in long-past days, had been\r\nwont to bellow through a speaking-trumpet, hoarsely enough to frighten\r\nBoreas himself to silence. They knew, these excellent old persons,\r\nthat, by all established rule—and, as regarded some of them, weighed by\r\ntheir own lack of efficiency for business—they ought to have given\r\nplace to younger men, more orthodox in politics, and altogether fitter\r\nthan themselves to serve our common Uncle. I knew it, too, but could\r\nnever quite find in my heart to act upon the knowledge. Much and\r\ndeservedly to my own discredit, therefore, and considerably to the\r\ndetriment of my official conscience, they continued, during my\r\nincumbency, to creep about the wharves, and loiter up and down the\r\nCustom-House steps. They spent a good deal of time, also, asleep in\r\ntheir accustomed corners, with their chairs tilted back against the\r\nwalls; awaking, however, once or twice in the forenoon, to bore one\r\nanother with the several thousandth repetition of old sea-stories and\r\nmouldy jokes, that had grown to be passwords and countersigns among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe discovery was soon made, I imagine, that the new Surveyor had no\r\ngreat harm in him. So, with lightsome hearts and the happy\r\nconsciousness of being usefully employed—in their own behalf at least,\r\nif not for our beloved country—these good old gentlemen went through\r\nthe various formalities of office. Sagaciously under their spectacles,\r\ndid they peep into the holds of vessels. Mighty was their fuss about\r\nlittle matters, and marvellous, sometimes, the obtuseness that allowed\r\ngreater ones to slip between their fingers! Whenever such a mischance\r\noccurred—when a waggon-load of valuable merchandise had been smuggled\r\nashore, at noonday, perhaps, and directly beneath their unsuspicious\r\nnoses—nothing could exceed the vigilance and alacrity with which they\r\nproceeded to lock, and double-lock, and secure with tape and\r\nsealing-wax, all the avenues of the delinquent vessel. Instead of a\r\nreprimand for their previous negligence, the case seemed rather to\r\nrequire an eulogium on their praiseworthy caution after the mischief\r\nhad happened; a grateful recognition of the promptitude of their zeal\r\nthe moment that there was no longer any remedy.\r\n\r\nUnless people are more than commonly disagreeable, it is my foolish\r\nhabit to contract a kindness for them. The better part of my\r\ncompanion’s character, if it have a better part, is that which usually\r\ncomes uppermost in my regard, and forms the type whereby I recognise\r\nthe man. As most of these old Custom-House officers had good traits,\r\nand as my position in reference to them, being paternal and protective,\r\nwas favourable to the growth of friendly sentiments, I soon grew to\r\nlike them all. It was pleasant in the summer forenoons—when the fervent\r\nheat, that almost liquefied the rest of the human family, merely\r\ncommunicated a genial warmth to their half torpid systems—it was\r\npleasant to hear them chatting in the back entry, a row of them all\r\ntipped against the wall, as usual; while the frozen witticisms of past\r\ngenerations were thawed out, and came bubbling with laughter from their\r\nlips. Externally, the jollity of aged men has much in common with the\r\nmirth of children; the intellect, any more than a deep sense of humour,\r\nhas little to do with the matter; it is, with both, a gleam that plays\r\nupon the surface, and imparts a sunny and cheery aspect alike to the\r\ngreen branch and grey, mouldering trunk. In one case, however, it is\r\nreal sunshine; in the other, it more resembles the phosphorescent glow\r\nof decaying wood.\r\n\r\nIt would be sad injustice, the reader must understand, to represent all\r\nmy excellent old friends as in their dotage. In the first place, my\r\ncoadjutors were not invariably old; there were men among them in their\r\nstrength and prime, of marked ability and energy, and altogether\r\nsuperior to the sluggish and dependent mode of life on which their evil\r\nstars had cast them. Then, moreover, the white locks of age were\r\nsometimes found to be the thatch of an intellectual tenement in good\r\nrepair. But, as respects the majority of my corps of veterans, there\r\nwill be no wrong done if I characterize them generally as a set of\r\nwearisome old souls, who had gathered nothing worth preservation from\r\ntheir varied experience of life. They seemed to have flung away all the\r\ngolden grain of practical wisdom, which they had enjoyed so many\r\nopportunities of harvesting, and most carefully to have stored their\r\nmemory with the husks. They spoke with far more interest and unction of\r\ntheir morning’s breakfast, or yesterday’s, today’s, or tomorrow’s\r\ndinner, than of the shipwreck of forty or fifty years ago, and all the\r\nworld’s wonders which they had witnessed with their youthful eyes.\r\n\r\nThe father of the Custom-House—the patriarch, not only of this little\r\nsquad of officials, but, I am bold to say, of the respectable body of\r\ntide-waiters all over the United States—was a certain permanent\r\nInspector. He might truly be termed a legitimate son of the revenue\r\nsystem, dyed in the wool, or rather born in the purple; since his sire,\r\na Revolutionary colonel, and formerly collector of the port, had\r\ncreated an office for him, and appointed him to fill it, at a period of\r\nthe early ages which few living men can now remember. This Inspector,\r\nwhen I first knew him, was a man of fourscore years, or thereabouts,\r\nand certainly one of the most wonderful specimens of winter-green that\r\nyou would be likely to discover in a lifetime’s search. With his florid\r\ncheek, his compact figure smartly arrayed in a bright-buttoned blue\r\ncoat, his brisk and vigorous step, and his hale and hearty aspect,\r\naltogether he seemed—not young, indeed—but a kind of new contrivance of\r\nMother Nature in the shape of man, whom age and infirmity had no\r\nbusiness to touch. His voice and laugh, which perpetually re-echoed\r\nthrough the Custom-House, had nothing of the tremulous quaver and\r\ncackle of an old man’s utterance; they came strutting out of his lungs,\r\nlike the crow of a cock, or the blast of a clarion. Looking at him\r\nmerely as an animal—and there was very little else to look at—he was a\r\nmost satisfactory object, from the thorough healthfulness and\r\nwholesomeness of his system, and his capacity, at that extreme age, to\r\nenjoy all, or nearly all, the delights which he had ever aimed at or\r\nconceived of. The careless security of his life in the Custom-House, on\r\na regular income, and with but slight and infrequent apprehensions of\r\nremoval, had no doubt contributed to make time pass lightly over him.\r\nThe original and more potent causes, however, lay in the rare\r\nperfection of his animal nature, the moderate proportion of intellect,\r\nand the very trifling admixture of moral and spiritual ingredients;\r\nthese latter qualities, indeed, being in barely enough measure to keep\r\nthe old gentleman from walking on all-fours. He possessed no power of\r\nthought, no depth of feeling, no troublesome sensibilities: nothing, in\r\nshort, but a few commonplace instincts, which, aided by the cheerful\r\ntemper which grew inevitably out of his physical well-being, did duty\r\nvery respectably, and to general acceptance, in lieu of a heart. He had\r\nbeen the husband of three wives, all long since dead; the father of\r\ntwenty children, most of whom, at every age of childhood or maturity,\r\nhad likewise returned to dust. Here, one would suppose, might have been\r\nsorrow enough to imbue the sunniest disposition through and through\r\nwith a sable tinge. Not so with our old Inspector. One brief sigh\r\nsufficed to carry off the entire burden of these dismal reminiscences.\r\nThe next moment he was as ready for sport as any unbreeched infant: far\r\nreadier than the Collector’s junior clerk, who at nineteen years was\r\nmuch the elder and graver man of the two.\r\n\r\nI used to watch and study this patriarchal personage with, I think,\r\nlivelier curiosity than any other form of humanity there presented to\r\nmy notice. He was, in truth, a rare phenomenon; so perfect, in one\r\npoint of view; so shallow, so delusive, so impalpable such an absolute\r\nnonentity, in every other. My conclusion was that he had no soul, no\r\nheart, no mind; nothing, as I have already said, but instincts; and\r\nyet, withal, so cunningly had the few materials of his character been\r\nput together that there was no painful perception of deficiency, but,\r\non my part, an entire contentment with what I found in him. It might be\r\ndifficult—and it was so—to conceive how he should exist hereafter, so\r\nearthly and sensuous did he seem; but surely his existence here,\r\nadmitting that it was to terminate with his last breath, had been not\r\nunkindly given; with no higher moral responsibilities than the beasts\r\nof the field, but with a larger scope of enjoyment than theirs, and\r\nwith all their blessed immunity from the dreariness and duskiness of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nOne point in which he had vastly the advantage over his four-footed\r\nbrethren was his ability to recollect the good dinners which it had\r\nmade no small portion of the happiness of his life to eat. His\r\ngourmandism was a highly agreeable trait; and to hear him talk of roast\r\nmeat was as appetizing as a pickle or an oyster. As he possessed no\r\nhigher attribute, and neither sacrificed nor vitiated any spiritual\r\nendowment by devoting all his energies and ingenuities to subserve the\r\ndelight and profit of his maw, it always pleased and satisfied me to\r\nhear him expatiate on fish, poultry, and butcher’s meat, and the most\r\neligible methods of preparing them for the table. His reminiscences of\r\ngood cheer, however ancient the date of the actual banquet, seemed to\r\nbring the savour of pig or turkey under one’s very nostrils. There were\r\nflavours on his palate that had lingered there not less than sixty or\r\nseventy years, and were still apparently as fresh as that of the mutton\r\nchop which he had just devoured for his breakfast. I have heard him\r\nsmack his lips over dinners, every guest at which, except himself, had\r\nlong been food for worms. It was marvellous to observe how the ghosts\r\nof bygone meals were continually rising up before him—not in anger or\r\nretribution, but as if grateful for his former appreciation, and\r\nseeking to reduplicate an endless series of enjoyment, at once shadowy\r\nand sensual: a tenderloin of beef, a hind-quarter of veal, a spare-rib\r\nof pork, a particular chicken, or a remarkably praiseworthy turkey,\r\nwhich had perhaps adorned his board in the days of the elder Adams,\r\nwould be remembered; while all the subsequent experience of our race,\r\nand all the events that brightened or darkened his individual career,\r\nhad gone over him with as little permanent effect as the passing\r\nbreeze. The chief tragic event of the old man’s life, so far as I could\r\njudge, was his mishap with a certain goose, which lived and died some\r\ntwenty or forty years ago: a goose of most promising figure, but which,\r\nat table, proved so inveterately tough, that the carving-knife would\r\nmake no impression on its carcase, and it could only be divided with an\r\naxe and handsaw.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to quit this sketch; on which, however, I should be glad\r\nto dwell at considerably more length, because of all men whom I have\r\never known, this individual was fittest to be a Custom-House officer.\r\nMost persons, owing to causes which I may not have space to hint at,\r\nsuffer moral detriment from this peculiar mode of life. The old\r\nInspector was incapable of it; and, were he to continue in office to\r\nthe end of time, would be just as good as he was then, and sit down to\r\ndinner with just as good an appetite.\r\n\r\nThere is one likeness, without which my gallery of Custom-House\r\nportraits would be strangely incomplete, but which my comparatively few\r\nopportunities for observation enable me to sketch only in the merest\r\noutline. It is that of the Collector, our gallant old General, who,\r\nafter his brilliant military service, subsequently to which he had\r\nruled over a wild Western territory, had come hither, twenty years\r\nbefore, to spend the decline of his varied and honourable life.\r\n\r\nThe brave soldier had already numbered, nearly or quite, his\r\nthree-score years and ten, and was pursuing the remainder of his\r\nearthly march, burdened with infirmities which even the martial music\r\nof his own spirit-stirring recollections could do little towards\r\nlightening. The step was palsied now, that had been foremost in the\r\ncharge. It was only with the assistance of a servant, and by leaning\r\nhis hand heavily on the iron balustrade, that he could slowly and\r\npainfully ascend the Custom-House steps, and, with a toilsome progress\r\nacross the floor, attain his customary chair beside the fireplace.\r\nThere he used to sit, gazing with a somewhat dim serenity of aspect at\r\nthe figures that came and went, amid the rustle of papers, the\r\nadministering of oaths, the discussion of business, and the casual talk\r\nof the office; all which sounds and circumstances seemed but\r\nindistinctly to impress his senses, and hardly to make their way into\r\nhis inner sphere of contemplation. His countenance, in this repose, was\r\nmild and kindly. If his notice was sought, an expression of courtesy\r\nand interest gleamed out upon his features, proving that there was\r\nlight within him, and that it was only the outward medium of the\r\nintellectual lamp that obstructed the rays in their passage. The closer\r\nyou penetrated to the substance of his mind, the sounder it appeared.\r\nWhen no longer called upon to speak or listen—either of which\r\noperations cost him an evident effort—his face would briefly subside\r\ninto its former not uncheerful quietude. It was not painful to behold\r\nthis look; for, though dim, it had not the imbecility of decaying age.\r\nThe framework of his nature, originally strong and massive, was not yet\r\ncrumpled into ruin.\r\n\r\nTo observe and define his character, however, under such disadvantages,\r\nwas as difficult a task as to trace out and build up anew, in\r\nimagination, an old fortress, like Ticonderoga, from a view of its grey\r\nand broken ruins. Here and there, perchance, the walls may remain\r\nalmost complete; but elsewhere may be only a shapeless mound, cumbrous\r\nwith its very strength, and overgrown, through long years of peace and\r\nneglect, with grass and alien weeds.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, looking at the old warrior with affection—for, slight as\r\nwas the communication between us, my feeling towards him, like that of\r\nall bipeds and quadrupeds who knew him, might not improperly be termed\r\nso,—I could discern the main points of his portrait. It was marked with\r\nthe noble and heroic qualities which showed it to be not a mere\r\naccident, but of good right, that he had won a distinguished name. His\r\nspirit could never, I conceive, have been characterized by an uneasy\r\nactivity; it must, at any period of his life, have required an impulse\r\nto set him in motion; but once stirred up, with obstacles to overcome,\r\nand an adequate object to be attained, it was not in the man to give\r\nout or fail. The heat that had formerly pervaded his nature, and which\r\nwas not yet extinct, was never of the kind that flashes and flickers in\r\na blaze; but rather a deep red glow, as of iron in a furnace. Weight,\r\nsolidity, firmness—this was the expression of his repose, even in such\r\ndecay as had crept untimely over him at the period of which I speak.\r\nBut I could imagine, even then, that, under some excitement which\r\nshould go deeply into his consciousness—roused by a trumpet’s peal,\r\nloud enough to awaken all of his energies that were not dead, but only\r\nslumbering—he was yet capable of flinging off his infirmities like a\r\nsick man’s gown, dropping the staff of age to seize a battle-sword, and\r\nstarting up once more a warrior. And, in so intense a moment his\r\ndemeanour would have still been calm. Such an exhibition, however, was\r\nbut to be pictured in fancy; not to be anticipated, nor desired. What I\r\nsaw in him—as evidently as the indestructible ramparts of Old\r\nTiconderoga, already cited as the most appropriate simile—was the\r\nfeatures of stubborn and ponderous endurance, which might well have\r\namounted to obstinacy in his earlier days; of integrity, that, like\r\nmost of his other endowments, lay in a somewhat heavy mass, and was\r\njust as unmalleable or unmanageable as a ton of iron ore; and of\r\nbenevolence which, fiercely as he led the bayonets on at Chippewa or\r\nFort Erie, I take to be of quite as genuine a stamp as what actuates\r\nany or all the polemical philanthropists of the age. He had slain men\r\nwith his own hand, for aught I know—certainly, they had fallen like\r\nblades of grass at the sweep of the scythe before the charge to which\r\nhis spirit imparted its triumphant energy—but, be that as it might,\r\nthere was never in his heart so much cruelty as would have brushed the\r\ndown off a butterfly’s wing. I have not known the man to whose innate\r\nkindliness I would more confidently make an appeal.\r\n\r\nMany characteristics—and those, too, which contribute not the least\r\nforcibly to impart resemblance in a sketch—must have vanished, or been\r\nobscured, before I met the General. All merely graceful attributes are\r\nusually the most evanescent; nor does nature adorn the human ruin with\r\nblossoms of new beauty, that have their roots and proper nutriment only\r\nin the chinks and crevices of decay, as she sows wall-flowers over the\r\nruined fortress of Ticonderoga. Still, even in respect of grace and\r\nbeauty, there were points well worth noting. A ray of humour, now and\r\nthen, would make its way through the veil of dim obstruction, and\r\nglimmer pleasantly upon our faces. A trait of native elegance, seldom\r\nseen in the masculine character after childhood or early youth, was\r\nshown in the General’s fondness for the sight and fragrance of flowers.\r\nAn old soldier might be supposed to prize only the bloody laurel on his\r\nbrow; but here was one who seemed to have a young girl’s appreciation\r\nof the floral tribe.\r\n\r\nThere, beside the fireplace, the brave old General used to sit; while\r\nthe Surveyor—though seldom, when it could be avoided, taking upon\r\nhimself the difficult task of engaging him in conversation—was fond of\r\nstanding at a distance, and watching his quiet and almost slumberous\r\ncountenance. He seemed away from us, although we saw him but a few\r\nyards off; remote, though we passed close beside his chair;\r\nunattainable, though we might have stretched forth our hands and\r\ntouched his own. It might be that he lived a more real life within his\r\nthoughts than amid the unappropriate environment of the Collector’s\r\noffice. The evolutions of the parade; the tumult of the battle; the\r\nflourish of old heroic music, heard thirty years before—such scenes and\r\nsounds, perhaps, were all alive before his intellectual sense.\r\nMeanwhile, the merchants and ship-masters, the spruce clerks and\r\nuncouth sailors, entered and departed; the bustle of his commercial and\r\nCustom-House life kept up its little murmur round about him; and\r\nneither with the men nor their affairs did the General appear to\r\nsustain the most distant relation. He was as much out of place as an\r\nold sword—now rusty, but which had flashed once in the battle’s front,\r\nand showed still a bright gleam along its blade—would have been among\r\nthe inkstands, paper-folders, and mahogany rulers on the Deputy\r\nCollector’s desk.\r\n\r\nThere was one thing that much aided me in renewing and re-creating the\r\nstalwart soldier of the Niagara frontier—the man of true and simple\r\nenergy. It was the recollection of those memorable words of his—“I’ll\r\ntry, Sir”—spoken on the very verge of a desperate and heroic\r\nenterprise, and breathing the soul and spirit of New England hardihood,\r\ncomprehending all perils, and encountering all. If, in our country,\r\nvalour were rewarded by heraldic honour, this phrase—which it seems so\r\neasy to speak, but which only he, with such a task of danger and glory\r\nbefore him, has ever spoken—would be the best and fittest of all\r\nmottoes for the General’s shield of arms.\r\n\r\nIt contributes greatly towards a man’s moral and intellectual health to\r\nbe brought into habits of companionship with individuals unlike\r\nhimself, who care little for his pursuits, and whose sphere and\r\nabilities he must go out of himself to appreciate. The accidents of my\r\nlife have often afforded me this advantage, but never with more fulness\r\nand variety than during my continuance in office. There was one man,\r\nespecially, the observation of whose character gave me a new idea of\r\ntalent. His gifts were emphatically those of a man of business; prompt,\r\nacute, clear-minded; with an eye that saw through all perplexities, and\r\na faculty of arrangement that made them vanish as by the waving of an\r\nenchanter’s wand. Bred up from boyhood in the Custom-House, it was his\r\nproper field of activity; and the many intricacies of business, so\r\nharassing to the interloper, presented themselves before him with the\r\nregularity of a perfectly comprehended system. In my contemplation, he\r\nstood as the ideal of his class. He was, indeed, the Custom-House in\r\nhimself; or, at all events, the mainspring that kept its variously\r\nrevolving wheels in motion; for, in an institution like this, where its\r\nofficers are appointed to subserve their own profit and convenience,\r\nand seldom with a leading reference to their fitness for the duty to be\r\nperformed, they must perforce seek elsewhere the dexterity which is not\r\nin them. Thus, by an inevitable necessity, as a magnet attracts\r\nsteel-filings, so did our man of business draw to himself the\r\ndifficulties which everybody met with. With an easy condescension, and\r\nkind forbearance towards our stupidity—which, to his order of mind,\r\nmust have seemed little short of crime—would he forth-with, by the\r\nmerest touch of his finger, make the incomprehensible as clear as\r\ndaylight. The merchants valued him not less than we, his esoteric\r\nfriends. His integrity was perfect; it was a law of nature with him,\r\nrather than a choice or a principle; nor can it be otherwise than the\r\nmain condition of an intellect so remarkably clear and accurate as his\r\nto be honest and regular in the administration of affairs. A stain on\r\nhis conscience, as to anything that came within the range of his\r\nvocation, would trouble such a man very much in the same way, though to\r\na far greater degree, than an error in the balance of an account, or an\r\nink-blot on the fair page of a book of record. Here, in a word—and it\r\nis a rare instance in my life—I had met with a person thoroughly\r\nadapted to the situation which he held.\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the people with whom I now found myself connected. I\r\ntook it in good part, at the hands of Providence, that I was thrown\r\ninto a position so little akin to my past habits; and set myself\r\nseriously to gather from it whatever profit was to be had. After my\r\nfellowship of toil and impracticable schemes with the dreamy brethren\r\nof Brook Farm; after living for three years within the subtle influence\r\nof an intellect like Emerson’s; after those wild, free days on the\r\nAssabeth, indulging fantastic speculations, beside our fire of fallen\r\nboughs, with Ellery Channing; after talking with Thoreau about\r\npine-trees and Indian relics in his hermitage at Walden; after growing\r\nfastidious by sympathy with the classic refinement of Hillard’s\r\nculture; after becoming imbued with poetic sentiment at Longfellow’s\r\nhearthstone—it was time, at length, that I should exercise other\r\nfaculties of my nature, and nourish myself with food for which I had\r\nhitherto had little appetite. Even the old Inspector was desirable, as\r\na change of diet, to a man who had known Alcott. I looked upon it as an\r\nevidence, in some measure, of a system naturally well balanced, and\r\nlacking no essential part of a thorough organization, that, with such\r\nassociates to remember, I could mingle at once with men of altogether\r\ndifferent qualities, and never murmur at the change.\r\n\r\nLiterature, its exertions and objects, were now of little moment in my\r\nregard. I cared not at this period for books; they were apart from me.\r\nNature—except it were human nature—the nature that is developed in\r\nearth and sky, was, in one sense, hidden from me; and all the\r\nimaginative delight wherewith it had been spiritualized passed away out\r\nof my mind. A gift, a faculty, if it had not been departed, was\r\nsuspended and inanimate within me. There would have been something sad,\r\nunutterably dreary, in all this, had I not been conscious that it lay\r\nat my own option to recall whatever was valuable in the past. It might\r\nbe true, indeed, that this was a life which could not, with impunity,\r\nbe lived too long; else, it might make me permanently other than I had\r\nbeen, without transforming me into any shape which it would be worth my\r\nwhile to take. But I never considered it as other than a transitory\r\nlife. There was always a prophetic instinct, a low whisper in my ear,\r\nthat within no long period, and whenever a new change of custom should\r\nbe essential to my good, change would come.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there I was, a Surveyor of the Revenue and, so far as I have\r\nbeen able to understand, as good a Surveyor as need be. A man of\r\nthought, fancy, and sensibility (had he ten times the Surveyor’s\r\nproportion of those qualities), may, at any time, be a man of affairs,\r\nif he will only choose to give himself the trouble. My fellow-officers,\r\nand the merchants and sea-captains with whom my official duties brought\r\nme into any manner of connection, viewed me in no other light, and\r\nprobably knew me in no other character. None of them, I presume, had\r\never read a page of my inditing, or would have cared a fig the more for\r\nme if they had read them all; nor would it have mended the matter, in\r\nthe least, had those same unprofitable pages been written with a pen\r\nlike that of Burns or of Chaucer, each of whom was a Custom-House\r\nofficer in his day, as well as I. It is a good lesson—though it may\r\noften be a hard one—for a man who has dreamed of literary fame, and of\r\nmaking for himself a rank among the world’s dignitaries by such means,\r\nto step aside out of the narrow circle in which his claims are\r\nrecognized and to find how utterly devoid of significance, beyond that\r\ncircle, is all that he achieves, and all he aims at. I know not that I\r\nespecially needed the lesson, either in the way of warning or rebuke;\r\nbut at any rate, I learned it thoroughly: nor, it gives me pleasure to\r\nreflect, did the truth, as it came home to my perception, ever cost me\r\na pang, or require to be thrown off in a sigh. In the way of literary\r\ntalk, it is true, the Naval Officer—an excellent fellow, who came into\r\nthe office with me, and went out only a little later—would often engage\r\nme in a discussion about one or the other of his favourite topics,\r\nNapoleon or Shakespeare. The Collector’s junior clerk, too a young\r\ngentleman who, it was whispered occasionally covered a sheet of Uncle\r\nSam’s letter paper with what (at the distance of a few yards) looked\r\nvery much like poetry—used now and then to speak to me of books, as\r\nmatters with which I might possibly be conversant. This was my all of\r\nlettered intercourse; and it was quite sufficient for my necessities.\r\n\r\nNo longer seeking nor caring that my name should be blasoned abroad on\r\ntitle-pages, I smiled to think that it had now another kind of vogue.\r\nThe Custom-House marker imprinted it, with a stencil and black paint,\r\non pepper-bags, and baskets of anatto, and cigar-boxes, and bales of\r\nall kinds of dutiable merchandise, in testimony that these commodities\r\nhad paid the impost, and gone regularly through the office. Borne on\r\nsuch queer vehicle of fame, a knowledge of my existence, so far as a\r\nname conveys it, was carried where it had never been before, and, I\r\nhope, will never go again.\r\n\r\nBut the past was not dead. Once in a great while, the thoughts that had\r\nseemed so vital and so active, yet had been put to rest so quietly,\r\nrevived again. One of the most remarkable occasions, when the habit of\r\nbygone days awoke in me, was that which brings it within the law of\r\nliterary propriety to offer the public the sketch which I am now\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nIn the second storey of the Custom-House there is a large room, in\r\nwhich the brick-work and naked rafters have never been covered with\r\npanelling and plaster. The edifice—originally projected on a scale\r\nadapted to the old commercial enterprise of the port, and with an idea\r\nof subsequent prosperity destined never to be realized—contains far\r\nmore space than its occupants know what to do with. This airy hall,\r\ntherefore, over the Collector’s apartments, remains unfinished to this\r\nday, and, in spite of the aged cobwebs that festoon its dusky beams,\r\nappears still to await the labour of the carpenter and mason. At one\r\nend of the room, in a recess, were a number of barrels piled one upon\r\nanother, containing bundles of official documents. Large quantities of\r\nsimilar rubbish lay lumbering the floor. It was sorrowful to think how\r\nmany days, and weeks, and months, and years of toil had been wasted on\r\nthese musty papers, which were now only an encumbrance on earth, and\r\nwere hidden away in this forgotten corner, never more to be glanced at\r\nby human eyes. But then, what reams of other manuscripts—filled, not\r\nwith the dulness of official formalities, but with the thought of\r\ninventive brains and the rich effusion of deep hearts—had gone equally\r\nto oblivion; and that, moreover, without serving a purpose in their\r\nday, as these heaped-up papers had, and—saddest of all—without\r\npurchasing for their writers the comfortable livelihood which the\r\nclerks of the Custom-House had gained by these worthless scratchings of\r\nthe pen. Yet not altogether worthless, perhaps, as materials of local\r\nhistory. Here, no doubt, statistics of the former commerce of Salem\r\nmight be discovered, and memorials of her princely merchants—old King\r\nDerby—old Billy Gray—old Simon Forrester—and many another magnate in\r\nhis day, whose powdered head, however, was scarcely in the tomb before\r\nhis mountain pile of wealth began to dwindle. The founders of the\r\ngreater part of the families which now compose the aristocracy of Salem\r\nmight here be traced, from the petty and obscure beginnings of their\r\ntraffic, at periods generally much posterior to the Revolution, upward\r\nto what their children look upon as long-established rank.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Revolution there is a dearth of records; the earlier\r\ndocuments and archives of the Custom-House having, probably, been\r\ncarried off to Halifax, when all the king’s officials accompanied the\r\nBritish army in its flight from Boston. It has often been a matter of\r\nregret with me; for, going back, perhaps, to the days of the\r\nProtectorate, those papers must have contained many references to\r\nforgotten or remembered men, and to antique customs, which would have\r\naffected me with the same pleasure as when I used to pick up Indian\r\narrow-heads in the field near the Old Manse.\r\n\r\nBut, one idle and rainy day, it was my fortune to make a discovery of\r\nsome little interest. Poking and burrowing into the heaped-up rubbish\r\nin the corner, unfolding one and another document, and reading the\r\nnames of vessels that had long ago foundered at sea or rotted at the\r\nwharves, and those of merchants never heard of now on ’Change, nor very\r\nreadily decipherable on their mossy tombstones; glancing at such\r\nmatters with the saddened, weary, half-reluctant interest which we\r\nbestow on the corpse of dead activity—and exerting my fancy, sluggish\r\nwith little use, to raise up from these dry bones an image of the old\r\ntown’s brighter aspect, when India was a new region, and only Salem\r\nknew the way thither—I chanced to lay my hand on a small package,\r\ncarefully done up in a piece of ancient yellow parchment. This envelope\r\nhad the air of an official record of some period long past, when clerks\r\nengrossed their stiff and formal chirography on more substantial\r\nmaterials than at present. There was something about it that quickened\r\nan instinctive curiosity, and made me undo the faded red tape that tied\r\nup the package, with the sense that a treasure would here be brought to\r\nlight. Unbending the rigid folds of the parchment cover, I found it to\r\nbe a commission, under the hand and seal of Governor Shirley, in favour\r\nof one Jonathan Pue, as Surveyor of His Majesty’s Customs for the Port\r\nof Salem, in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. I remembered to have\r\nread (probably in Felt’s “Annals”) a notice of the decease of Mr.\r\nSurveyor Pue, about fourscore years ago; and likewise, in a newspaper\r\nof recent times, an account of the digging up of his remains in the\r\nlittle graveyard of St. Peter’s Church, during the renewal of that\r\nedifice. Nothing, if I rightly call to mind, was left of my respected\r\npredecessor, save an imperfect skeleton, and some fragments of apparel,\r\nand a wig of majestic frizzle, which, unlike the head that it once\r\nadorned, was in very satisfactory preservation. But, on examining the\r\npapers which the parchment commission served to envelop, I found more\r\ntraces of Mr. Pue’s mental part, and the internal operations of his\r\nhead, than the frizzled wig had contained of the venerable skull\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThey were documents, in short, not official, but of a private nature,\r\nor, at least, written in his private capacity, and apparently with his\r\nown hand. I could account for their being included in the heap of\r\nCustom-House lumber only by the fact that Mr. Pue’s death had happened\r\nsuddenly, and that these papers, which he probably kept in his official\r\ndesk, had never come to the knowledge of his heirs, or were supposed to\r\nrelate to the business of the revenue. On the transfer of the archives\r\nto Halifax, this package, proving to be of no public concern, was left\r\nbehind, and had remained ever since unopened.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Surveyor—being little molested, I suppose, at that early\r\nday with business pertaining to his office—seems to have devoted some\r\nof his many leisure hours to researches as a local antiquarian, and\r\nother inquisitions of a similar nature. These supplied material for\r\npetty activity to a mind that would otherwise have been eaten up with\r\nrust. A portion of his facts, by the by, did me good service in the\r\npreparation of the article entitled “MAIN STREET,” included in the\r\npresent volume. The remainder may perhaps be applied to purposes\r\nequally valuable hereafter, or not impossibly may be worked up, so far\r\nas they go, into a regular history of Salem, should my veneration for\r\nthe natal soil ever impel me to so pious a task. Meanwhile, they shall\r\nbe at the command of any gentleman, inclined and competent, to take the\r\nunprofitable labour off my hands. As a final disposition I contemplate\r\ndepositing them with the Essex Historical Society. But the object that\r\nmost drew my attention to the mysterious package was a certain affair\r\nof fine red cloth, much worn and faded, There were traces about it of\r\ngold embroidery, which, however, was greatly frayed and defaced, so\r\nthat none, or very little, of the glitter was left. It had been\r\nwrought, as was easy to perceive, with wonderful skill of needlework;\r\nand the stitch (as I am assured by ladies conversant with such\r\nmysteries) gives evidence of a now forgotten art, not to be discovered\r\neven by the process of picking out the threads. This rag of scarlet\r\ncloth—for time, and wear, and a sacrilegious moth had reduced it to\r\nlittle other than a rag—on careful examination, assumed the shape of a\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nIt was the capital letter A. By an accurate measurement, each limb\r\nproved to be precisely three inches and a quarter in length. It had\r\nbeen intended, there could be no doubt, as an ornamental article of\r\ndress; but how it was to be worn, or what rank, honour, and dignity, in\r\nby-past times, were signified by it, was a riddle which (so evanescent\r\nare the fashions of the world in these particulars) I saw little hope\r\nof solving. And yet it strangely interested me. My eyes fastened\r\nthemselves upon the old scarlet letter, and would not be turned aside.\r\nCertainly there was some deep meaning in it most worthy of\r\ninterpretation, and which, as it were, streamed forth from the mystic\r\nsymbol, subtly communicating itself to my sensibilities, but evading\r\nthe analysis of my mind.\r\n\r\nWhen thus perplexed—and cogitating, among other hypotheses, whether the\r\nletter might not have been one of those decorations which the white men\r\nused to contrive in order to take the eyes of Indians—I happened to\r\nplace it on my breast. It seemed to me—the reader may smile, but must\r\nnot doubt my word—it seemed to me, then, that I experienced a sensation\r\nnot altogether physical, yet almost so, as of burning heat, and as if\r\nthe letter were not of red cloth, but red-hot iron. I shuddered, and\r\ninvoluntarily let it fall upon the floor.\r\n\r\nIn the absorbing contemplation of the scarlet letter, I had hitherto\r\nneglected to examine a small roll of dingy paper, around which it had\r\nbeen twisted. This I now opened, and had the satisfaction to find\r\nrecorded by the old Surveyor’s pen, a reasonably complete explanation\r\nof the whole affair. There were several foolscap sheets, containing\r\nmany particulars respecting the life and conversation of one Hester\r\nPrynne, who appeared to have been rather a noteworthy personage in the\r\nview of our ancestors. She had flourished during the period between the\r\nearly days of Massachusetts and the close of the seventeenth century.\r\nAged persons, alive in the time of Mr. Surveyor Pue, and from whose\r\noral testimony he had made up his narrative, remembered her, in their\r\nyouth, as a very old, but not decrepit woman, of a stately and solemn\r\naspect. It had been her habit, from an almost immemorial date, to go\r\nabout the country as a kind of voluntary nurse, and doing whatever\r\nmiscellaneous good she might; taking upon herself, likewise, to give\r\nadvice in all matters, especially those of the heart, by which means—as\r\na person of such propensities inevitably must—she gained from many\r\npeople the reverence due to an angel, but, I should imagine, was looked\r\nupon by others as an intruder and a nuisance. Prying further into the\r\nmanuscript, I found the record of other doings and sufferings of this\r\nsingular woman, for most of which the reader is referred to the story\r\nentitled “THE SCARLET LETTER”; and it should be borne carefully in mind\r\nthat the main facts of that story are authorized and authenticated by\r\nthe document of Mr. Surveyor Pue. The original papers, together with\r\nthe scarlet letter itself—a most curious relic—are still in my\r\npossession, and shall be freely exhibited to whomsoever, induced by the\r\ngreat interest of the narrative, may desire a sight of them. I must not\r\nbe understood affirming that, in the dressing up of the tale, and\r\nimagining the motives and modes of passion that influenced the\r\ncharacters who figure in it, I have invariably confined myself within\r\nthe limits of the old Surveyor’s half-a-dozen sheets of foolscap. On\r\nthe contrary, I have allowed myself, as to such points, nearly, or\r\naltogether, as much license as if the facts had been entirely of my own\r\ninvention. What I contend for is the authenticity of the outline.\r\n\r\nThis incident recalled my mind, in some degree, to its old track. There\r\nseemed to be here the groundwork of a tale. It impressed me as if the\r\nancient Surveyor, in his garb of a hundred years gone by, and wearing\r\nhis immortal wig—which was buried with him, but did not perish in the\r\ngrave—had met me in the deserted chamber of the Custom-House. In his\r\nport was the dignity of one who had borne His Majesty’s commission, and\r\nwho was therefore illuminated by a ray of the splendour that shone so\r\ndazzlingly about the throne. How unlike alas the hangdog look of a\r\nrepublican official, who, as the servant of the people, feels himself\r\nless than the least, and below the lowest of his masters. With his own\r\nghostly hand, the obscurely seen, but majestic, figure had imparted to\r\nme the scarlet symbol and the little roll of explanatory manuscript.\r\nWith his own ghostly voice he had exhorted me, on the sacred\r\nconsideration of my filial duty and reverence towards him—who might\r\nreasonably regard himself as my official ancestor—to bring his mouldy\r\nand moth-eaten lucubrations before the public. “Do this,” said the\r\nghost of Mr. Surveyor Pue, emphatically nodding the head that looked so\r\nimposing within its memorable wig; “do this, and the profit shall be\r\nall your own. You will shortly need it; for it is not in your days as\r\nit was in mine, when a man’s office was a life-lease, and oftentimes an\r\nheirloom. But I charge you, in this matter of old Mistress Prynne, give\r\nto your predecessor’s memory the credit which will be rightfully due”\r\nAnd I said to the ghost of Mr. Surveyor Pue—“I will”.\r\n\r\nOn Hester Prynne’s story, therefore, I bestowed much thought. It was\r\nthe subject of my meditations for many an hour, while pacing to and fro\r\nacross my room, or traversing, with a hundredfold repetition, the long\r\nextent from the front door of the Custom-House to the side entrance,\r\nand back again. Great were the weariness and annoyance of the old\r\nInspector and the Weighers and Gaugers, whose slumbers were disturbed\r\nby the unmercifully lengthened tramp of my passing and returning\r\nfootsteps. Remembering their own former habits, they used to say that\r\nthe Surveyor was walking the quarter-deck. They probably fancied that\r\nmy sole object—and, indeed, the sole object for which a sane man could\r\never put himself into voluntary motion—was to get an appetite for\r\ndinner. And, to say the truth, an appetite, sharpened by the east wind\r\nthat generally blew along the passage, was the only valuable result of\r\nso much indefatigable exercise. So little adapted is the atmosphere of\r\na Custom-house to the delicate harvest of fancy and sensibility, that,\r\nhad I remained there through ten Presidencies yet to come, I doubt\r\nwhether the tale of “The Scarlet Letter” would ever have been brought\r\nbefore the public eye. My imagination was a tarnished mirror. It would\r\nnot reflect, or only with miserable dimness, the figures with which I\r\ndid my best to people it. The characters of the narrative would not be\r\nwarmed and rendered malleable by any heat that I could kindle at my\r\nintellectual forge. They would take neither the glow of passion nor the\r\ntenderness of sentiment, but retained all the rigidity of dead corpses,\r\nand stared me in the face with a fixed and ghastly grin of contemptuous\r\ndefiance. “What have you to do with us?” that expression seemed to say.\r\n“The little power you might have once possessed over the tribe of\r\nunrealities is gone! You have bartered it for a pittance of the public\r\ngold. Go then, and earn your wages!” In short, the almost torpid\r\ncreatures of my own fancy twitted me with imbecility, and not without\r\nfair occasion.\r\n\r\nIt was not merely during the three hours and a half which Uncle Sam\r\nclaimed as his share of my daily life that this wretched numbness held\r\npossession of me. It went with me on my sea-shore walks and rambles\r\ninto the country, whenever—which was seldom and reluctantly—I bestirred\r\nmyself to seek that invigorating charm of Nature which used to give me\r\nsuch freshness and activity of thought, the moment that I stepped\r\nacross the threshold of the Old Manse. The same torpor, as regarded the\r\ncapacity for intellectual effort, accompanied me home, and weighed upon\r\nme in the chamber which I most absurdly termed my study. Nor did it\r\nquit me when, late at night, I sat in the deserted parlour, lighted\r\nonly by the glimmering coal-fire and the moon, striving to picture\r\nforth imaginary scenes, which, the next day, might flow out on the\r\nbrightening page in many-hued description.\r\n\r\nIf the imaginative faculty refused to act at such an hour, it might\r\nwell be deemed a hopeless case. Moonlight, in a familiar room, falling\r\nso white upon the carpet, and showing all its figures so\r\ndistinctly—making every object so minutely visible, yet so unlike a\r\nmorning or noontide visibility—is a medium the most suitable for a\r\nromance-writer to get acquainted with his illusive guests. There is the\r\nlittle domestic scenery of the well-known apartment; the chairs, with\r\neach its separate individuality; the centre-table, sustaining a\r\nwork-basket, a volume or two, and an extinguished lamp; the sofa; the\r\nbook-case; the picture on the wall—all these details, so completely\r\nseen, are so spiritualised by the unusual light, that they seem to lose\r\ntheir actual substance, and become things of intellect. Nothing is too\r\nsmall or too trifling to undergo this change, and acquire dignity\r\nthereby. A child’s shoe; the doll, seated in her little wicker\r\ncarriage; the hobby-horse—whatever, in a word, has been used or played\r\nwith during the day is now invested with a quality of strangeness and\r\nremoteness, though still almost as vividly present as by daylight.\r\nThus, therefore, the floor of our familiar room has become a neutral\r\nterritory, somewhere between the real world and fairy-land, where the\r\nActual and the Imaginary may meet, and each imbue itself with the\r\nnature of the other. Ghosts might enter here without affrighting us. It\r\nwould be too much in keeping with the scene to excite surprise, were we\r\nto look about us and discover a form, beloved, but gone hence, now\r\nsitting quietly in a streak of this magic moonshine, with an aspect\r\nthat would make us doubt whether it had returned from afar, or had\r\nnever once stirred from our fireside.\r\n\r\nThe somewhat dim coal fire has an essential Influence in producing the\r\neffect which I would describe. It throws its unobtrusive tinge\r\nthroughout the room, with a faint ruddiness upon the walls and ceiling,\r\nand a reflected gleam upon the polish of the furniture. This warmer\r\nlight mingles itself with the cold spirituality of the moon-beams, and\r\ncommunicates, as it were, a heart and sensibilities of human tenderness\r\nto the forms which fancy summons up. It converts them from snow-images\r\ninto men and women. Glancing at the looking-glass, we behold—deep\r\nwithin its haunted verge—the smouldering glow of the half-extinguished\r\nanthracite, the white moon-beams on the floor, and a repetition of all\r\nthe gleam and shadow of the picture, with one remove further from the\r\nactual, and nearer to the imaginative. Then, at such an hour, and with\r\nthis scene before him, if a man, sitting all alone, cannot dream\r\nstrange things, and make them look like truth, he need never try to\r\nwrite romances.\r\n\r\nBut, for myself, during the whole of my Custom-House experience,\r\nmoonlight and sunshine, and the glow of firelight, were just alike in\r\nmy regard; and neither of them was of one whit more avail than the\r\ntwinkle of a tallow-candle. An entire class of susceptibilities, and a\r\ngift connected with them—of no great richness or value, but the best I\r\nhad—was gone from me.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief, however, that had I attempted a different order of\r\ncomposition, my faculties would not have been found so pointless and\r\ninefficacious. I might, for instance, have contented myself with\r\nwriting out the narratives of a veteran shipmaster, one of the\r\nInspectors, whom I should be most ungrateful not to mention, since\r\nscarcely a day passed that he did not stir me to laughter and\r\nadmiration by his marvelous gifts as a story-teller. Could I have\r\npreserved the picturesque force of his style, and the humourous\r\ncolouring which nature taught him how to throw over his descriptions,\r\nthe result, I honestly believe, would have been something new in\r\nliterature. Or I might readily have found a more serious task. It was a\r\nfolly, with the materiality of this daily life pressing so intrusively\r\nupon me, to attempt to fling myself back into another age, or to insist\r\non creating the semblance of a world out of airy matter, when, at every\r\nmoment, the impalpable beauty of my soap-bubble was broken by the rude\r\ncontact of some actual circumstance. The wiser effort would have been\r\nto diffuse thought and imagination through the opaque substance of\r\ntoday, and thus to make it a bright transparency; to spiritualise the\r\nburden that began to weigh so heavily; to seek, resolutely, the true\r\nand indestructible value that lay hidden in the petty and wearisome\r\nincidents, and ordinary characters with which I was now conversant. The\r\nfault was mine. The page of life that was spread out before me seemed\r\ndull and commonplace only because I had not fathomed its deeper import.\r\nA better book than I shall ever write was there; leaf after leaf\r\npresenting itself to me, just as it was written out by the reality of\r\nthe flitting hour, and vanishing as fast as written, only because my\r\nbrain wanted the insight, and my hand the cunning, to transcribe it. At\r\nsome future day, it may be, I shall remember a few scattered fragments\r\nand broken paragraphs, and write them down, and find the letters turn\r\nto gold upon the page.\r\n\r\nThese perceptions had come too late. At the Instant, I was only\r\nconscious that what would have been a pleasure once was now a hopeless\r\ntoil. There was no occasion to make much moan about this state of\r\naffairs. I had ceased to be a writer of tolerably poor tales and\r\nessays, and had become a tolerably good Surveyor of the Customs. That\r\nwas all. But, nevertheless, it is anything but agreeable to be haunted\r\nby a suspicion that one’s intellect is dwindling away, or exhaling,\r\nwithout your consciousness, like ether out of a phial; so that, at\r\nevery glance, you find a smaller and less volatile residuum. Of the\r\nfact there could be no doubt and, examining myself and others, I was\r\nled to conclusions, in reference to the effect of public office on the\r\ncharacter, not very favourable to the mode of life in question. In some\r\nother form, perhaps, I may hereafter develop these effects. Suffice it\r\nhere to say that a Custom-House officer of long continuance can hardly\r\nbe a very praiseworthy or respectable personage, for many reasons; one\r\nof them, the tenure by which he holds his situation, and another, the\r\nvery nature of his business, which—though, I trust, an honest one—is of\r\nsuch a sort that he does not share in the united effort of mankind.\r\n\r\nAn effect—which I believe to be observable, more or less, in every\r\nindividual who has occupied the position—is, that while he leans on the\r\nmighty arm of the Republic, his own proper strength departs from him.\r\nHe loses, in an extent proportioned to the weakness or force of his\r\noriginal nature, the capability of self-support. If he possesses an\r\nunusual share of native energy, or the enervating magic of place do not\r\noperate too long upon him, his forfeited powers may be redeemable. The\r\nejected officer—fortunate in the unkindly shove that sends him forth\r\nbetimes, to struggle amid a struggling world—may return to himself, and\r\nbecome all that he has ever been. But this seldom happens. He usually\r\nkeeps his ground just long enough for his own ruin, and is then thrust\r\nout, with sinews all unstrung, to totter along the difficult footpath\r\nof life as he best may. Conscious of his own infirmity—that his\r\ntempered steel and elasticity are lost—he for ever afterwards looks\r\nwistfully about him in quest of support external to himself. His\r\npervading and continual hope—a hallucination, which, in the face of all\r\ndiscouragement, and making light of impossibilities, haunts him while\r\nhe lives, and, I fancy, like the convulsive throes of the cholera,\r\ntorments him for a brief space after death—is, that finally, and in no\r\nlong time, by some happy coincidence of circumstances, he shall be\r\nrestored to office. This faith, more than anything else, steals the\r\npith and availability out of whatever enterprise he may dream of\r\nundertaking. Why should he toil and moil, and be at so much trouble to\r\npick himself up out of the mud, when, in a little while hence, the\r\nstrong arm of his Uncle will raise and support him? Why should he work\r\nfor his living here, or go to dig gold in California, when he is so\r\nsoon to be made happy, at monthly intervals, with a little pile of\r\nglittering coin out of his Uncle’s pocket? It is sadly curious to\r\nobserve how slight a taste of office suffices to infect a poor fellow\r\nwith this singular disease. Uncle Sam’s gold—meaning no disrespect to\r\nthe worthy old gentleman—has, in this respect, a quality of enchantment\r\nlike that of the devil’s wages. Whoever touches it should look well to\r\nhimself, or he may find the bargain to go hard against him, involving,\r\nif not his soul, yet many of its better attributes; its sturdy force,\r\nits courage and constancy, its truth, its self-reliance, and all that\r\ngives the emphasis to manly character.\r\n\r\nHere was a fine prospect in the distance. Not that the Surveyor brought\r\nthe lesson home to himself, or admitted that he could be so utterly\r\nundone, either by continuance in office or ejectment. Yet my\r\nreflections were not the most comfortable. I began to grow melancholy\r\nand restless; continually prying into my mind, to discover which of its\r\npoor properties were gone, and what degree of detriment had already\r\naccrued to the remainder. I endeavoured to calculate how much longer I\r\ncould stay in the Custom-House, and yet go forth a man. To confess the\r\ntruth, it was my greatest apprehension—as it would never be a measure\r\nof policy to turn out so quiet an individual as myself; and it being\r\nhardly in the nature of a public officer to resign—it was my chief\r\ntrouble, therefore, that I was likely to grow grey and decrepit in the\r\nSurveyorship, and become much such another animal as the old Inspector.\r\nMight it not, in the tedious lapse of official life that lay before me,\r\nfinally be with me as it was with this venerable friend—to make the\r\ndinner-hour the nucleus of the day, and to spend the rest of it, as an\r\nold dog spends it, asleep in the sunshine or in the shade? A dreary\r\nlook-forward, this, for a man who felt it to be the best definition of\r\nhappiness to live throughout the whole range of his faculties and\r\nsensibilities. But, all this while, I was giving myself very\r\nunnecessary alarm. Providence had meditated better things for me than I\r\ncould possibly imagine for myself.\r\n\r\nA remarkable event of the third year of my Surveyorship—to adopt the\r\ntone of “P. P.”—was the election of General Taylor to the Presidency.\r\nIt is essential, in order to form a complete estimate of the advantages\r\nof official life, to view the incumbent at the incoming of a hostile\r\nadministration. His position is then one of the most singularly\r\nirksome, and, in every contingency, disagreeable, that a wretched\r\nmortal can possibly occupy; with seldom an alternative of good on\r\neither hand, although what presents itself to him as the worst event\r\nmay very probably be the best. But it is a strange experience, to a man\r\nof pride and sensibility, to know that his interests are within the\r\ncontrol of individuals who neither love nor understand him, and by\r\nwhom, since one or the other must needs happen, he would rather be\r\ninjured than obliged. Strange, too, for one who has kept his calmness\r\nthroughout the contest, to observe the bloodthirstiness that is\r\ndeveloped in the hour of triumph, and to be conscious that he is\r\nhimself among its objects! There are few uglier traits of human nature\r\nthan this tendency—which I now witnessed in men no worse than their\r\nneighbours—to grow cruel, merely because they possessed the power of\r\ninflicting harm. If the guillotine, as applied to office-holders, were\r\na literal fact, instead of one of the most apt of metaphors, it is my\r\nsincere belief that the active members of the victorious party were\r\nsufficiently excited to have chopped off all our heads, and have\r\nthanked Heaven for the opportunity! It appears to me—who have been a\r\ncalm and curious observer, as well in victory as defeat—that this\r\nfierce and bitter spirit of malice and revenge has never distinguished\r\nthe many triumphs of my own party as it now did that of the Whigs. The\r\nDemocrats take the offices, as a general rule, because they need them,\r\nand because the practice of many years has made it the law of political\r\nwarfare, which unless a different system be proclaimed, it was weakness\r\nand cowardice to murmur at. But the long habit of victory has made them\r\ngenerous. They know how to spare when they see occasion; and when they\r\nstrike, the axe may be sharp indeed, but its edge is seldom poisoned\r\nwith ill-will; nor is it their custom ignominiously to kick the head\r\nwhich they have just struck off.\r\n\r\nIn short, unpleasant as was my predicament, at best, I saw much reason\r\nto congratulate myself that I was on the losing side rather than the\r\ntriumphant one. If, heretofore, I had been none of the warmest of\r\npartisans I began now, at this season of peril and adversity, to be\r\npretty acutely sensible with which party my predilections lay; nor was\r\nit without something like regret and shame that, according to a\r\nreasonable calculation of chances, I saw my own prospect of retaining\r\noffice to be better than those of my democratic brethren. But who can\r\nsee an inch into futurity beyond his nose? My own head was the first\r\nthat fell.\r\n\r\nThe moment when a man’s head drops off is seldom or never, I am\r\ninclined to think, precisely the most agreeable of his life.\r\nNevertheless, like the greater part of our misfortunes, even so serious\r\na contingency brings its remedy and consolation with it, if the\r\nsufferer will but make the best rather than the worst, of the accident\r\nwhich has befallen him. In my particular case the consolatory topics\r\nwere close at hand, and, indeed, had suggested themselves to my\r\nmeditations a considerable time before it was requisite to use them. In\r\nview of my previous weariness of office, and vague thoughts of\r\nresignation, my fortune somewhat resembled that of a person who should\r\nentertain an idea of committing suicide, and although beyond his hopes,\r\nmeet with the good hap to be murdered. In the Custom-House, as before\r\nin the Old Manse, I had spent three years—a term long enough to rest a\r\nweary brain: long enough to break off old intellectual habits, and make\r\nroom for new ones: long enough, and too long, to have lived in an\r\nunnatural state, doing what was really of no advantage nor delight to\r\nany human being, and withholding myself from toil that would, at least,\r\nhave stilled an unquiet impulse in me. Then, moreover, as regarded his\r\nunceremonious ejectment, the late Surveyor was not altogether\r\nill-pleased to be recognised by the Whigs as an enemy; since his\r\ninactivity in political affairs—his tendency to roam, at will, in that\r\nbroad and quiet field where all mankind may meet, rather than confine\r\nhimself to those narrow paths where brethren of the same household must\r\ndiverge from one another—had sometimes made it questionable with his\r\nbrother Democrats whether he was a friend. Now, after he had won the\r\ncrown of martyrdom (though with no longer a head to wear it on), the\r\npoint might be looked upon as settled. Finally, little heroic as he\r\nwas, it seemed more decorous to be overthrown in the downfall of the\r\nparty with which he had been content to stand than to remain a forlorn\r\nsurvivor, when so many worthier men were falling: and at last, after\r\nsubsisting for four years on the mercy of a hostile administration, to\r\nbe compelled then to define his position anew, and claim the yet more\r\nhumiliating mercy of a friendly one.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the press had taken up my affair, and kept me for a week or\r\ntwo careering through the public prints, in my decapitated state, like\r\nIrving’s Headless Horseman, ghastly and grim, and longing to be buried,\r\nas a political dead man ought. So much for my figurative self. The real\r\nhuman being all this time, with his head safely on his shoulders, had\r\nbrought himself to the comfortable conclusion that everything was for\r\nthe best; and making an investment in ink, paper, and steel pens, had\r\nopened his long-disused writing desk, and was again a literary man.\r\n\r\nNow it was that the lucubrations of my ancient predecessor, Mr.\r\nSurveyor Pue, came into play. Rusty through long idleness, some little\r\nspace was requisite before my intellectual machinery could be brought\r\nto work upon the tale with an effect in any degree satisfactory. Even\r\nyet, though my thoughts were ultimately much absorbed in the task, it\r\nwears, to my eye, a stern and sombre aspect: too much ungladdened by\r\ngenial sunshine; too little relieved by the tender and familiar\r\ninfluences which soften almost every scene of nature and real life, and\r\nundoubtedly should soften every picture of them. This uncaptivating\r\neffect is perhaps due to the period of hardly accomplished revolution,\r\nand still seething turmoil, in which the story shaped itself. It is no\r\nindication, however, of a lack of cheerfulness in the writer’s mind:\r\nfor he was happier while straying through the gloom of these sunless\r\nfantasies than at any time since he had quitted the Old Manse. Some of\r\nthe briefer articles, which contribute to make up the volume, have\r\nlikewise been written since my involuntary withdrawal from the toils\r\nand honours of public life, and the remainder are gleaned from annuals\r\nand magazines, of such antique date, that they have gone round the\r\ncircle, and come back to novelty again. Keeping up the metaphor of the\r\npolitical guillotine, the whole may be considered as the POSTHUMOUS\r\nPAPERS OF A DECAPITATED SURVEYOR: and the sketch which I am now\r\nbringing to a close, if too autobiographical for a modest person to\r\npublish in his lifetime, will readily be excused in a gentleman who\r\nwrites from beyond the grave. Peace be with all the world! My blessing\r\non my friends! My forgiveness to my enemies! For I am in the realm of\r\nquiet!\r\n\r\nThe life of the Custom-House lies like a dream behind me. The old\r\nInspector—who, by the by, I regret to say, was overthrown and killed\r\nby a horse some time ago, else he would certainly have lived for\r\never—he, and all those other venerable personages who sat with him at\r\nthe receipt of custom, are but shadows in my view: white-headed and\r\nwrinkled images, which my fancy used to sport with, and has now flung\r\naside for ever. The merchants—Pingree, Phillips, Shepard, Upton,\r\nKimball, Bertram, Hunt—these and many other names, which had such\r\nclassic familiarity for my ear six months ago,—these men of traffic,\r\nwho seemed to occupy so important a position in the world—how little\r\ntime has it required to disconnect me from them all, not merely in act,\r\nbut recollection! It is with an effort that I recall the figures and\r\nappellations of these few. Soon, likewise, my old native town will loom\r\nupon me through the haze of memory, a mist brooding over and around it;\r\nas if it were no portion of the real earth, but an overgrown village in\r\ncloud-land, with only imaginary inhabitants to people its wooden houses\r\nand walk its homely lanes, and the unpicturesque prolixity of its main\r\nstreet. Henceforth it ceases to be a reality of my life; I am a citizen\r\nof somewhere else. My good townspeople will not much regret me,\r\nfor—though it has been as dear an object as any, in my literary\r\nefforts, to be of some importance in their eyes, and to win myself a\r\npleasant memory in this abode and burial-place of so many of my\r\nforefathers—there has never been, for me, the genial atmosphere which a\r\nliterary man requires in order to ripen the best harvest of his mind. I\r\nshall do better amongst other faces; and these familiar ones, it need\r\nhardly be said, will do just as well without me.\r\n\r\nIt may be, however—oh, transporting and triumphant thought—that the\r\ngreat-grandchildren of the present race may sometimes think kindly of\r\nthe scribbler of bygone days, when the antiquary of days to come, among\r\nthe sites memorable in the town’s history, shall point out the locality\r\nof THE TOWN PUMP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCARLET LETTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\nTHE PRISON DOOR\r\n\r\n\r\nA throng of bearded men, in sad-coloured garments and grey\r\nsteeple-crowned hats, intermixed with women, some wearing hoods, and\r\nothers bareheaded, was assembled in front of a wooden edifice, the door\r\nof which was heavily timbered with oak, and studded with iron spikes.\r\n\r\nThe founders of a new colony, whatever Utopia of human virtue and\r\nhappiness they might originally project, have invariably recognised it\r\namong their earliest practical necessities to allot a portion of the\r\nvirgin soil as a cemetery, and another portion as the site of a prison.\r\nIn accordance with this rule it may safely be assumed that the\r\nforefathers of Boston had built the first prison-house somewhere in the\r\nvicinity of Cornhill, almost as seasonably as they marked out the first\r\nburial-ground, on Isaac Johnson’s lot, and round about his grave, which\r\nsubsequently became the nucleus of all the congregated sepulchres in\r\nthe old churchyard of King’s Chapel. Certain it is that, some fifteen\r\nor twenty years after the settlement of the town, the wooden jail was\r\nalready marked with weather-stains and other indications of age, which\r\ngave a yet darker aspect to its beetle-browed and gloomy front. The\r\nrust on the ponderous iron-work of its oaken door looked more antique\r\nthan anything else in the New World. Like all that pertains to crime,\r\nit seemed never to have known a youthful era. Before this ugly edifice,\r\nand between it and the wheel-track of the street, was a grass-plot,\r\nmuch overgrown with burdock, pig-weed, apple-pern, and such unsightly\r\nvegetation, which evidently found something congenial in the soil that\r\nhad so early borne the black flower of civilised society, a prison. But\r\non one side of the portal, and rooted almost at the threshold, was a\r\nwild rose-bush, covered, in this month of June, with its delicate gems,\r\nwhich might be imagined to offer their fragrance and fragile beauty to\r\nthe prisoner as he went in, and to the condemned criminal as he came\r\nforth to his doom, in token that the deep heart of Nature could pity\r\nand be kind to him.\r\n\r\nThis rose-bush, by a strange chance, has been kept alive in history;\r\nbut whether it had merely survived out of the stern old wilderness, so\r\nlong after the fall of the gigantic pines and oaks that originally\r\novershadowed it, or whether, as there is fair authority for believing,\r\nit had sprung up under the footsteps of the sainted Ann Hutchinson as\r\nshe entered the prison-door, we shall not take upon us to determine.\r\nFinding it so directly on the threshold of our narrative, which is now\r\nabout to issue from that inauspicious portal, we could hardly do\r\notherwise than pluck one of its flowers, and present it to the reader.\r\nIt may serve, let us hope, to symbolise some sweet moral blossom that\r\nmay be found along the track, or relieve the darkening close of a tale\r\nof human frailty and sorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nTHE MARKET-PLACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grass-plot before the jail, in Prison Lane, on a certain summer\r\nmorning, not less than two centuries ago, was occupied by a pretty\r\nlarge number of the inhabitants of Boston, all with their eyes intently\r\nfastened on the iron-clamped oaken door. Amongst any other population,\r\nor at a later period in the history of New England, the grim rigidity\r\nthat petrified the bearded physiognomies of these good people would\r\nhave augured some awful business in hand. It could have betokened\r\nnothing short of the anticipated execution of some noted culprit, on\r\nwhom the sentence of a legal tribunal had but confirmed the verdict of\r\npublic sentiment. But, in that early severity of the Puritan character,\r\nan inference of this kind could not so indubitably be drawn. It might\r\nbe that a sluggish bond-servant, or an undutiful child, whom his\r\nparents had given over to the civil authority, was to be corrected at\r\nthe whipping-post. It might be that an Antinomian, a Quaker, or other\r\nheterodox religionist, was to be scourged out of the town, or an idle\r\nor vagrant Indian, whom the white man’s firewater had made riotous\r\nabout the streets, was to be driven with stripes into the shadow of the\r\nforest. It might be, too, that a witch, like old Mistress Hibbins, the\r\nbitter-tempered widow of the magistrate, was to die upon the gallows.\r\nIn either case, there was very much the same solemnity of demeanour on\r\nthe part of the spectators, as befitted a people among whom religion\r\nand law were almost identical, and in whose character both were so\r\nthoroughly interfused, that the mildest and severest acts of public\r\ndiscipline were alike made venerable and awful. Meagre, indeed, and\r\ncold, was the sympathy that a transgressor might look for, from such\r\nbystanders, at the scaffold. On the other hand, a penalty which, in our\r\ndays, would infer a degree of mocking infamy and ridicule, might then\r\nbe invested with almost as stern a dignity as the punishment of death\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIt was a circumstance to be noted on the summer morning when our story\r\nbegins its course, that the women, of whom there were several in the\r\ncrowd, appeared to take a peculiar interest in whatever penal\r\ninfliction might be expected to ensue. The age had not so much\r\nrefinement, that any sense of impropriety restrained the wearers of\r\npetticoat and farthingale from stepping forth into the public ways, and\r\nwedging their not unsubstantial persons, if occasion were, into the\r\nthrong nearest to the scaffold at an execution. Morally, as well as\r\nmaterially, there was a coarser fibre in those wives and maidens of old\r\nEnglish birth and breeding than in their fair descendants, separated\r\nfrom them by a series of six or seven generations; for, throughout that\r\nchain of ancestry, every successive mother had transmitted to her child\r\na fainter bloom, a more delicate and briefer beauty, and a slighter\r\nphysical frame, if not character of less force and solidity than her\r\nown. The women who were now standing about the prison-door stood within\r\nless than half a century of the period when the man-like Elizabeth had\r\nbeen the not altogether unsuitable representative of the sex. They were\r\nher countrywomen: and the beef and ale of their native land, with a\r\nmoral diet not a whit more refined, entered largely into their\r\ncomposition. The bright morning sun, therefore, shone on broad\r\nshoulders and well-developed busts, and on round and ruddy cheeks, that\r\nhad ripened in the far-off island, and had hardly yet grown paler or\r\nthinner in the atmosphere of New England. There was, moreover, a\r\nboldness and rotundity of speech among these matrons, as most of them\r\nseemed to be, that would startle us at the present day, whether in\r\nrespect to its purport or its volume of tone.\r\n\r\n“Goodwives,” said a hard-featured dame of fifty, “I’ll tell ye a piece\r\nof my mind. It would be greatly for the public behoof if we women,\r\nbeing of mature age and church-members in good repute, should have the\r\nhandling of such malefactresses as this Hester Prynne. What think ye,\r\ngossips? If the hussy stood up for judgment before us five, that are\r\nnow here in a knot together, would she come off with such a sentence as\r\nthe worshipful magistrates have awarded? Marry, I trow not.”\r\n\r\n“People say,” said another, “that the Reverend Master Dimmesdale, her\r\ngodly pastor, takes it very grievously to heart that such a scandal\r\nshould have come upon his congregation.”\r\n\r\n“The magistrates are God-fearing gentlemen, but merciful overmuch—that\r\nis a truth,” added a third autumnal matron. “At the very least, they\r\nshould have put the brand of a hot iron on Hester Prynne’s forehead.\r\nMadame Hester would have winced at that, I warrant me. But she—the\r\nnaughty baggage—little will she care what they put upon the bodice of\r\nher gown! Why, look you, she may cover it with a brooch, or such like\r\nheathenish adornment, and so walk the streets as brave as ever!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, but,” interposed, more softly, a young wife, holding a child by\r\nthe hand, “let her cover the mark as she will, the pang of it will be\r\nalways in her heart.”\r\n\r\n“What do we talk of marks and brands, whether on the bodice of her gown\r\nor the flesh of her forehead?” cried another female, the ugliest as\r\nwell as the most pitiless of these self-constituted judges. “This woman\r\nhas brought shame upon us all, and ought to die; is there not law for\r\nit? Truly there is, both in the Scripture and the statute-book. Then\r\nlet the magistrates, who have made it of no effect, thank themselves if\r\ntheir own wives and daughters go astray.”\r\n\r\n“Mercy on us, goodwife!” exclaimed a man in the crowd, “is there no\r\nvirtue in woman, save what springs from a wholesome fear of the\r\ngallows? That is the hardest word yet! Hush now, gossips for the lock\r\nis turning in the prison-door, and here comes Mistress Prynne herself.”\r\n\r\nThe door of the jail being flung open from within there appeared, in\r\nthe first place, like a black shadow emerging into sunshine, the grim\r\nand grisly presence of the town-beadle, with a sword by his side, and\r\nhis staff of office in his hand. This personage prefigured and\r\nrepresented in his aspect the whole dismal severity of the Puritanic\r\ncode of law, which it was his business to administer in its final and\r\nclosest application to the offender. Stretching forth the official\r\nstaff in his left hand, he laid his right upon the shoulder of a young\r\nwoman, whom he thus drew forward, until, on the threshold of the\r\nprison-door, she repelled him, by an action marked with natural dignity\r\nand force of character, and stepped into the open air as if by her own\r\nfree will. She bore in her arms a child, a baby of some three months\r\nold, who winked and turned aside its little face from the too vivid\r\nlight of day; because its existence, heretofore, had brought it\r\nacquaintance only with the grey twilight of a dungeon, or other\r\ndarksome apartment of the prison.\r\n\r\nWhen the young woman—the mother of this child—stood fully revealed\r\nbefore the crowd, it seemed to be her first impulse to clasp the infant\r\nclosely to her bosom; not so much by an impulse of motherly affection,\r\nas that she might thereby conceal a certain token, which was wrought or\r\nfastened into her dress. In a moment, however, wisely judging that one\r\ntoken of her shame would but poorly serve to hide another, she took the\r\nbaby on her arm, and with a burning blush, and yet a haughty smile, and\r\na glance that would not be abashed, looked around at her townspeople\r\nand neighbours. On the breast of her gown, in fine red cloth,\r\nsurrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of\r\ngold thread, appeared the letter A. It was so artistically done, and\r\nwith so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy, that it had\r\nall the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the apparel which\r\nshe wore, and which was of a splendour in accordance with the taste of\r\nthe age, but greatly beyond what was allowed by the sumptuary\r\nregulations of the colony.\r\n\r\nThe young woman was tall, with a figure of perfect elegance on a large\r\nscale. She had dark and abundant hair, so glossy that it threw off the\r\nsunshine with a gleam; and a face which, besides being beautiful from\r\nregularity of feature and richness of complexion, had the\r\nimpressiveness belonging to a marked brow and deep black eyes. She was\r\nladylike, too, after the manner of the feminine gentility of those\r\ndays; characterised by a certain state and dignity, rather than by the\r\ndelicate, evanescent, and indescribable grace which is now recognised\r\nas its indication. And never had Hester Prynne appeared more ladylike,\r\nin the antique interpretation of the term, than as she issued from the\r\nprison. Those who had before known her, and had expected to behold her\r\ndimmed and obscured by a disastrous cloud, were astonished, and even\r\nstartled, to perceive how her beauty shone out, and made a halo of the\r\nmisfortune and ignominy in which she was enveloped. It may be true\r\nthat, to a sensitive observer, there was some thing exquisitely painful\r\nin it. Her attire, which indeed, she had wrought for the occasion in\r\nprison, and had modelled much after her own fancy, seemed to express\r\nthe attitude of her spirit, the desperate recklessness of her mood, by\r\nits wild and picturesque peculiarity. But the point which drew all\r\neyes, and, as it were, transfigured the wearer—so that both men and\r\nwomen who had been familiarly acquainted with Hester Prynne were now\r\nimpressed as if they beheld her for the first time—was that SCARLET\r\nLETTER, so fantastically embroidered and illuminated upon her bosom. It\r\nhad the effect of a spell, taking her out of the ordinary relations\r\nwith humanity, and enclosing her in a sphere by herself.\r\n\r\n“She hath good skill at her needle, that’s certain,” remarked one of\r\nher female spectators; “but did ever a woman, before this brazen hussy,\r\ncontrive such a way of showing it? Why, gossips, what is it but to\r\nlaugh in the faces of our godly magistrates, and make a pride out of\r\nwhat they, worthy gentlemen, meant for a punishment?”\r\n\r\n“It were well,” muttered the most iron-visaged of the old dames, “if we\r\nstripped Madame Hester’s rich gown off her dainty shoulders; and as for\r\nthe red letter which she hath stitched so curiously, I’ll bestow a rag\r\nof mine own rheumatic flannel to make a fitter one!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, peace, neighbours—peace!” whispered their youngest companion; “do\r\nnot let her hear you! Not a stitch in that embroidered letter but she\r\nhas felt it in her heart.”\r\n\r\nThe grim beadle now made a gesture with his staff. “Make way, good\r\npeople—make way, in the King’s name!” cried he. “Open a passage; and I\r\npromise ye, Mistress Prynne shall be set where man, woman, and child\r\nmay have a fair sight of her brave apparel from this time till an hour\r\npast meridian. A blessing on the righteous colony of the Massachusetts,\r\nwhere iniquity is dragged out into the sunshine! Come along, Madame\r\nHester, and show your scarlet letter in the market-place!”\r\n\r\nA lane was forthwith opened through the crowd of spectators. Preceded\r\nby the beadle, and attended by an irregular procession of stern-browed\r\nmen and unkindly visaged women, Hester Prynne set forth towards the\r\nplace appointed for her punishment. A crowd of eager and curious\r\nschoolboys, understanding little of the matter in hand, except that it\r\ngave them a half-holiday, ran before her progress, turning their heads\r\ncontinually to stare into her face and at the winking baby in her arms,\r\nand at the ignominious letter on her breast. It was no great distance,\r\nin those days, from the prison door to the market-place. Measured by\r\nthe prisoner’s experience, however, it might be reckoned a journey of\r\nsome length; for haughty as her demeanour was, she perchance underwent\r\nan agony from every footstep of those that thronged to see her, as if\r\nher heart had been flung into the street for them all to spurn and\r\ntrample upon. In our nature, however, there is a provision, alike\r\nmarvellous and merciful, that the sufferer should never know the\r\nintensity of what he endures by its present torture, but chiefly by the\r\npang that rankles after it. With almost a serene deportment, therefore,\r\nHester Prynne passed through this portion of her ordeal, and came to a\r\nsort of scaffold, at the western extremity of the market-place. It\r\nstood nearly beneath the eaves of Boston’s earliest church, and\r\nappeared to be a fixture there.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this scaffold constituted a portion of a penal machine, which\r\nnow, for two or three generations past, has been merely historical and\r\ntraditionary among us, but was held, in the old time, to be as\r\neffectual an agent, in the promotion of good citizenship, as ever was\r\nthe guillotine among the terrorists of France. It was, in short, the\r\nplatform of the pillory; and above it rose the framework of that\r\ninstrument of discipline, so fashioned as to confine the human head in\r\nits tight grasp, and thus hold it up to the public gaze. The very ideal\r\nof ignominy was embodied and made manifest in this contrivance of wood\r\nand iron. There can be no outrage, methinks, against our common\r\nnature—whatever be the delinquencies of the individual—no outrage more\r\nflagrant than to forbid the culprit to hide his face for shame; as it\r\nwas the essence of this punishment to do. In Hester Prynne’s instance,\r\nhowever, as not unfrequently in other cases, her sentence bore that she\r\nshould stand a certain time upon the platform, but without undergoing\r\nthat gripe about the neck and confinement of the head, the proneness to\r\nwhich was the most devilish characteristic of this ugly engine. Knowing\r\nwell her part, she ascended a flight of wooden steps, and was thus\r\ndisplayed to the surrounding multitude, at about the height of a man’s\r\nshoulders above the street.\r\n\r\nHad there been a Papist among the crowd of Puritans, he might have seen\r\nin this beautiful woman, so picturesque in her attire and mien, and\r\nwith the infant at her bosom, an object to remind him of the image of\r\nDivine Maternity, which so many illustrious painters have vied with one\r\nanother to represent; something which should remind him, indeed, but\r\nonly by contrast, of that sacred image of sinless motherhood, whose\r\ninfant was to redeem the world. Here, there was the taint of deepest\r\nsin in the most sacred quality of human life, working such effect, that\r\nthe world was only the darker for this woman’s beauty, and the more\r\nlost for the infant that she had borne.\r\n\r\nThe scene was not without a mixture of awe, such as must always invest\r\nthe spectacle of guilt and shame in a fellow-creature, before society\r\nshall have grown corrupt enough to smile, instead of shuddering at it.\r\nThe witnesses of Hester Prynne’s disgrace had not yet passed beyond\r\ntheir simplicity. They were stern enough to look upon her death, had\r\nthat been the sentence, without a murmur at its severity, but had none\r\nof the heartlessness of another social state, which would find only a\r\ntheme for jest in an exhibition like the present. Even had there been a\r\ndisposition to turn the matter into ridicule, it must have been\r\nrepressed and overpowered by the solemn presence of men no less\r\ndignified than the governor, and several of his counsellors, a judge, a\r\ngeneral, and the ministers of the town, all of whom sat or stood in a\r\nbalcony of the meeting-house, looking down upon the platform. When such\r\npersonages could constitute a part of the spectacle, without risking\r\nthe majesty, or reverence of rank and office, it was safely to be\r\ninferred that the infliction of a legal sentence would have an earnest\r\nand effectual meaning. Accordingly, the crowd was sombre and grave. The\r\nunhappy culprit sustained herself as best a woman might, under the\r\nheavy weight of a thousand unrelenting eyes, all fastened upon her, and\r\nconcentrated at her bosom. It was almost intolerable to be borne. Of an\r\nimpulsive and passionate nature, she had fortified herself to encounter\r\nthe stings and venomous stabs of public contumely, wreaking itself in\r\nevery variety of insult; but there was a quality so much more terrible\r\nin the solemn mood of the popular mind, that she longed rather to\r\nbehold all those rigid countenances contorted with scornful merriment,\r\nand herself the object. Had a roar of laughter burst from the\r\nmultitude—each man, each woman, each little shrill-voiced child,\r\ncontributing their individual parts—Hester Prynne might have repaid\r\nthem all with a bitter and disdainful smile. But, under the leaden\r\ninfliction which it was her doom to endure, she felt, at moments, as if\r\nshe must needs shriek out with the full power of her lungs, and cast\r\nherself from the scaffold down upon the ground, or else go mad at once.\r\n\r\nYet there were intervals when the whole scene, in which she was the\r\nmost conspicuous object, seemed to vanish from her eyes, or, at least,\r\nglimmered indistinctly before them, like a mass of imperfectly shaped\r\nand spectral images. Her mind, and especially her memory, was\r\npreternaturally active, and kept bringing up other scenes than this\r\nroughly hewn street of a little town, on the edge of the western\r\nwilderness: other faces than were lowering upon her from beneath the\r\nbrims of those steeple-crowned hats. Reminiscences, the most trifling\r\nand immaterial, passages of infancy and school-days, sports, childish\r\nquarrels, and the little domestic traits of her maiden years, came\r\nswarming back upon her, intermingled with recollections of whatever was\r\ngravest in her subsequent life; one picture precisely as vivid as\r\nanother; as if all were of similar importance, or all alike a play.\r\nPossibly, it was an instinctive device of her spirit to relieve itself\r\nby the exhibition of these phantasmagoric forms, from the cruel weight\r\nand hardness of the reality.\r\n\r\nBe that as it might, the scaffold of the pillory was a point of view\r\nthat revealed to Hester Prynne the entire track along which she had\r\nbeen treading, since her happy infancy. Standing on that miserable\r\neminence, she saw again her native village, in Old England, and her\r\npaternal home: a decayed house of grey stone, with a poverty-stricken\r\naspect, but retaining a half obliterated shield of arms over the\r\nportal, in token of antique gentility. She saw her father’s face, with\r\nits bold brow, and reverend white beard that flowed over the\r\nold-fashioned Elizabethan ruff; her mother’s, too, with the look of\r\nheedful and anxious love which it always wore in her remembrance, and\r\nwhich, even since her death, had so often laid the impediment of a\r\ngentle remonstrance in her daughter’s pathway. She saw her own face,\r\nglowing with girlish beauty, and illuminating all the interior of the\r\ndusky mirror in which she had been wont to gaze at it. There she beheld\r\nanother countenance, of a man well stricken in years, a pale, thin,\r\nscholar-like visage, with eyes dim and bleared by the lamp-light that\r\nhad served them to pore over many ponderous books. Yet those same\r\nbleared optics had a strange, penetrating power, when it was their\r\nowner’s purpose to read the human soul. This figure of the study and\r\nthe cloister, as Hester Prynne’s womanly fancy failed not to recall,\r\nwas slightly deformed, with the left shoulder a trifle higher than the\r\nright. Next rose before her in memory’s picture-gallery, the intricate\r\nand narrow thoroughfares, the tall, grey houses, the huge cathedrals,\r\nand the public edifices, ancient in date and quaint in architecture, of\r\na continental city; where new life had awaited her, still in connexion\r\nwith the misshapen scholar: a new life, but feeding itself on time-worn\r\nmaterials, like a tuft of green moss on a crumbling wall. Lastly, in\r\nlieu of these shifting scenes, came back the rude market-place of the\r\nPuritan settlement, with all the townspeople assembled, and levelling\r\ntheir stern regards at Hester Prynne—yes, at herself—who stood on the\r\nscaffold of the pillory, an infant on her arm, and the letter A, in\r\nscarlet, fantastically embroidered with gold thread, upon her bosom.\r\n\r\nCould it be true? She clutched the child so fiercely to her breast that\r\nit sent forth a cry; she turned her eyes downward at the scarlet\r\nletter, and even touched it with her finger, to assure herself that the\r\ninfant and the shame were real. Yes these were her realities—all else\r\nhad vanished!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nTHE RECOGNITION\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this intense consciousness of being the object of severe and\r\nuniversal observation, the wearer of the scarlet letter was at length\r\nrelieved, by discerning, on the outskirts of the crowd, a figure which\r\nirresistibly took possession of her thoughts. An Indian in his native\r\ngarb was standing there; but the red men were not so infrequent\r\nvisitors of the English settlements that one of them would have\r\nattracted any notice from Hester Prynne at such a time; much less would\r\nhe have excluded all other objects and ideas from her mind. By the\r\nIndian’s side, and evidently sustaining a companionship with him, stood\r\na white man, clad in a strange disarray of civilized and savage\r\ncostume.\r\n\r\nHe was small in stature, with a furrowed visage, which as yet could\r\nhardly be termed aged. There was a remarkable intelligence in his\r\nfeatures, as of a person who had so cultivated his mental part that it\r\ncould not fail to mould the physical to itself and become manifest by\r\nunmistakable tokens. Although, by a seemingly careless arrangement of\r\nhis heterogeneous garb, he had endeavoured to conceal or abate the\r\npeculiarity, it was sufficiently evident to Hester Prynne that one of\r\nthis man’s shoulders rose higher than the other. Again, at the first\r\ninstant of perceiving that thin visage, and the slight deformity of the\r\nfigure, she pressed her infant to her bosom with so convulsive a force\r\nthat the poor babe uttered another cry of pain. But the mother did not\r\nseem to hear it.\r\n\r\nAt his arrival in the market-place, and some time before she saw him,\r\nthe stranger had bent his eyes on Hester Prynne. It was carelessly at\r\nfirst, like a man chiefly accustomed to look inward, and to whom\r\nexternal matters are of little value and import, unless they bear\r\nrelation to something within his mind. Very soon, however, his look\r\nbecame keen and penetrative. A writhing horror twisted itself across\r\nhis features, like a snake gliding swiftly over them, and making one\r\nlittle pause, with all its wreathed intervolutions in open sight. His\r\nface darkened with some powerful emotion, which, nevertheless, he so\r\ninstantaneously controlled by an effort of his will, that, save at a\r\nsingle moment, its expression might have passed for calmness. After a\r\nbrief space, the convulsion grew almost imperceptible, and finally\r\nsubsided into the depths of his nature. When he found the eyes of\r\nHester Prynne fastened on his own, and saw that she appeared to\r\nrecognize him, he slowly and calmly raised his finger, made a gesture\r\nwith it in the air, and laid it on his lips.\r\n\r\nThen touching the shoulder of a townsman who stood near to him, he\r\naddressed him in a formal and courteous manner:\r\n\r\n“I pray you, good Sir,” said he, “who is this woman?—and wherefore is\r\nshe here set up to public shame?”\r\n\r\n“You must needs be a stranger in this region, friend,” answered the\r\ntownsman, looking curiously at the questioner and his savage companion,\r\n“else you would surely have heard of Mistress Hester Prynne and her\r\nevil doings. She hath raised a great scandal, I promise you, in godly\r\nMaster Dimmesdale’s church.”\r\n\r\n“You say truly,” replied the other; “I am a stranger, and have been a\r\nwanderer, sorely against my will. I have met with grievous mishaps by\r\nsea and land, and have been long held in bonds among the heathen-folk\r\nto the southward; and am now brought hither by this Indian to be\r\nredeemed out of my captivity. Will it please you, therefore, to tell me\r\nof Hester Prynne’s—have I her name rightly?—of this woman’s offences,\r\nand what has brought her to yonder scaffold?”\r\n\r\n“Truly, friend; and methinks it must gladden your heart, after your\r\ntroubles and sojourn in the wilderness,” said the townsman, “to find\r\nyourself at length in a land where iniquity is searched out and\r\npunished in the sight of rulers and people, as here in our godly New\r\nEngland. Yonder woman, Sir, you must know, was the wife of a certain\r\nlearned man, English by birth, but who had long ago dwelt in Amsterdam,\r\nwhence some good time agone he was minded to cross over and cast in his\r\nlot with us of the Massachusetts. To this purpose he sent his wife\r\nbefore him, remaining himself to look after some necessary affairs.\r\nMarry, good Sir, in some two years, or less, that the woman has been a\r\ndweller here in Boston, no tidings have come of this learned gentleman,\r\nMaster Prynne; and his young wife, look you, being left to her own\r\nmisguidance—”\r\n\r\n“Ah!—aha!—I conceive you,” said the stranger with a bitter smile. “So\r\nlearned a man as you speak of should have learned this too in his\r\nbooks. And who, by your favour, Sir, may be the father of yonder\r\nbabe—it is some three or four months old, I should judge—which Mistress\r\nPrynne is holding in her arms?”\r\n\r\n“Of a truth, friend, that matter remaineth a riddle; and the Daniel who\r\nshall expound it is yet a-wanting,” answered the townsman. “Madame\r\nHester absolutely refuseth to speak, and the magistrates have laid\r\ntheir heads together in vain. Peradventure the guilty one stands\r\nlooking on at this sad spectacle, unknown of man, and forgetting that\r\nGod sees him.”\r\n\r\n“The learned man,” observed the stranger with another smile, “should\r\ncome himself to look into the mystery.”\r\n\r\n“It behoves him well if he be still in life,” responded the townsman.\r\n“Now, good Sir, our Massachusetts magistracy, bethinking themselves\r\nthat this woman is youthful and fair, and doubtless was strongly\r\ntempted to her fall, and that, moreover, as is most likely, her husband\r\nmay be at the bottom of the sea, they have not been bold to put in\r\nforce the extremity of our righteous law against her. The penalty\r\nthereof is death. But in their great mercy and tenderness of heart they\r\nhave doomed Mistress Prynne to stand only a space of three hours on the\r\nplatform of the pillory, and then and thereafter, for the remainder of\r\nher natural life to wear a mark of shame upon her bosom.”\r\n\r\n“A wise sentence,” remarked the stranger, gravely, bowing his head.\r\n“Thus she will be a living sermon against sin, until the ignominious\r\nletter be engraved upon her tombstone. It irks me, nevertheless, that\r\nthe partner of her iniquity should not at least, stand on the scaffold\r\nby her side. But he will be known—he will be known!—he will be known!”\r\n\r\nHe bowed courteously to the communicative townsman, and whispering a\r\nfew words to his Indian attendant, they both made their way through the\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nWhile this passed, Hester Prynne had been standing on her pedestal,\r\nstill with a fixed gaze towards the stranger—so fixed a gaze that, at\r\nmoments of intense absorption, all other objects in the visible world\r\nseemed to vanish, leaving only him and her. Such an interview, perhaps,\r\nwould have been more terrible than even to meet him as she now did,\r\nwith the hot mid-day sun burning down upon her face, and lighting up\r\nits shame; with the scarlet token of infamy on her breast; with the\r\nsin-born infant in her arms; with a whole people, drawn forth as to a\r\nfestival, staring at the features that should have been seen only in\r\nthe quiet gleam of the fireside, in the happy shadow of a home, or\r\nbeneath a matronly veil at church. Dreadful as it was, she was\r\nconscious of a shelter in the presence of these thousand witnesses. It\r\nwas better to stand thus, with so many betwixt him and her, than to\r\ngreet him face to face—they two alone. She fled for refuge, as it were,\r\nto the public exposure, and dreaded the moment when its protection\r\nshould be withdrawn from her. Involved in these thoughts, she scarcely\r\nheard a voice behind her until it had repeated her name more than once,\r\nin a loud and solemn tone, audible to the whole multitude.\r\n\r\n“Hearken unto me, Hester Prynne!” said the voice.\r\n\r\nIt has already been noticed that directly over the platform on which\r\nHester Prynne stood was a kind of balcony, or open gallery, appended to\r\nthe meeting-house. It was the place whence proclamations were wont to\r\nbe made, amidst an assemblage of the magistracy, with all the\r\nceremonial that attended such public observances in those days. Here,\r\nto witness the scene which we are describing, sat Governor Bellingham\r\nhimself with four sergeants about his chair, bearing halberds, as a\r\nguard of honour. He wore a dark feather in his hat, a border of\r\nembroidery on his cloak, and a black velvet tunic beneath—a gentleman\r\nadvanced in years, with a hard experience written in his wrinkles. He\r\nwas not ill-fitted to be the head and representative of a community\r\nwhich owed its origin and progress, and its present state of\r\ndevelopment, not to the impulses of youth, but to the stern and\r\ntempered energies of manhood and the sombre sagacity of age;\r\naccomplishing so much, precisely because it imagined and hoped so\r\nlittle. The other eminent characters by whom the chief ruler was\r\nsurrounded were distinguished by a dignity of mien, belonging to a\r\nperiod when the forms of authority were felt to possess the sacredness\r\nof Divine institutions. They were, doubtless, good men, just and sage.\r\nBut, out of the whole human family, it would not have been easy to\r\nselect the same number of wise and virtuous persons, who should be less\r\ncapable of sitting in judgment on an erring woman’s heart, and\r\ndisentangling its mesh of good and evil, than the sages of rigid aspect\r\ntowards whom Hester Prynne now turned her face. She seemed conscious,\r\nindeed, that whatever sympathy she might expect lay in the larger and\r\nwarmer heart of the multitude; for, as she lifted her eyes towards the\r\nbalcony, the unhappy woman grew pale, and trembled.\r\n\r\nThe voice which had called her attention was that of the reverend and\r\nfamous John Wilson, the eldest clergyman of Boston, a great scholar,\r\nlike most of his contemporaries in the profession, and withal a man of\r\nkind and genial spirit. This last attribute, however, had been less\r\ncarefully developed than his intellectual gifts, and was, in truth,\r\nrather a matter of shame than self-congratulation with him. There he\r\nstood, with a border of grizzled locks beneath his skull-cap, while his\r\ngrey eyes, accustomed to the shaded light of his study, were winking,\r\nlike those of Hester’s infant, in the unadulterated sunshine. He looked\r\nlike the darkly engraved portraits which we see prefixed to old volumes\r\nof sermons, and had no more right than one of those portraits would\r\nhave to step forth, as he now did, and meddle with a question of human\r\nguilt, passion, and anguish.\r\n\r\n“Hester Prynne,” said the clergyman, “I have striven with my young\r\nbrother here, under whose preaching of the Word you have been\r\nprivileged to sit”—here Mr. Wilson laid his hand on the shoulder of a\r\npale young man beside him—“I have sought, I say, to persuade this godly\r\nyouth, that he should deal with you, here in the face of Heaven, and\r\nbefore these wise and upright rulers, and in hearing of all the people,\r\nas touching the vileness and blackness of your sin. Knowing your\r\nnatural temper better than I, he could the better judge what arguments\r\nto use, whether of tenderness or terror, such as might prevail over\r\nyour hardness and obstinacy, insomuch that you should no longer hide\r\nthe name of him who tempted you to this grievous fall. But he opposes\r\nto me—with a young man’s over-softness, albeit wise beyond his\r\nyears—that it were wronging the very nature of woman to force her to\r\nlay open her heart’s secrets in such broad daylight, and in presence of\r\nso great a multitude. Truly, as I sought to convince him, the shame lay\r\nin the commission of the sin, and not in the showing of it forth. What\r\nsay you to it, once again, brother Dimmesdale? Must it be thou, or I,\r\nthat shall deal with this poor sinner’s soul?”\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur among the dignified and reverend occupants of the\r\nbalcony; and Governor Bellingham gave expression to its purport,\r\nspeaking in an authoritative voice, although tempered with respect\r\ntowards the youthful clergyman whom he addressed:\r\n\r\n“Good Master Dimmesdale,” said he, “the responsibility of this woman’s\r\nsoul lies greatly with you. It behoves you; therefore, to exhort her to\r\nrepentance and to confession, as a proof and consequence thereof.”\r\n\r\nThe directness of this appeal drew the eyes of the whole crowd upon the\r\nReverend Mr. Dimmesdale—young clergyman, who had come from one of the\r\ngreat English universities, bringing all the learning of the age into\r\nour wild forest land. His eloquence and religious fervour had already\r\ngiven the earnest of high eminence in his profession. He was a person\r\nof very striking aspect, with a white, lofty, and impending brow;\r\nlarge, brown, melancholy eyes, and a mouth which, unless when he\r\nforcibly compressed it, was apt to be tremulous, expressing both\r\nnervous sensibility and a vast power of self restraint. Notwithstanding\r\nhis high native gifts and scholar-like attainments, there was an air\r\nabout this young minister—an apprehensive, a startled, a\r\nhalf-frightened look—as of a being who felt himself quite astray, and\r\nat a loss in the pathway of human existence, and could only be at ease\r\nin some seclusion of his own. Therefore, so far as his duties would\r\npermit, he trod in the shadowy by-paths, and thus kept himself simple\r\nand childlike, coming forth, when occasion was, with a freshness, and\r\nfragrance, and dewy purity of thought, which, as many people said,\r\naffected them like the speech of an angel.\r\n\r\nSuch was the young man whom the Reverend Mr. Wilson and the Governor\r\nhad introduced so openly to the public notice, bidding him speak, in\r\nthe hearing of all men, to that mystery of a woman’s soul, so sacred\r\neven in its pollution. The trying nature of his position drove the\r\nblood from his cheek, and made his lips tremulous.\r\n\r\n“Speak to the woman, my brother,” said Mr. Wilson. “It is of moment to\r\nher soul, and, therefore, as the worshipful Governor says, momentous to\r\nthine own, in whose charge hers is. Exhort her to confess the truth!”\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale bent his head, in silent prayer, as it\r\nseemed, and then came forward.\r\n\r\n“Hester Prynne,” said he, leaning over the balcony and looking down\r\nsteadfastly into her eyes, “thou hearest what this good man says, and\r\nseest the accountability under which I labour. If thou feelest it to be\r\nfor thy soul’s peace, and that thy earthly punishment will thereby be\r\nmade more effectual to salvation, I charge thee to speak out the name\r\nof thy fellow-sinner and fellow-sufferer! Be not silent from any\r\nmistaken pity and tenderness for him; for, believe me, Hester, though\r\nhe were to step down from a high place, and stand there beside thee, on\r\nthy pedestal of shame, yet better were it so than to hide a guilty\r\nheart through life. What can thy silence do for him, except it tempt\r\nhim—yea, compel him, as it were—to add hypocrisy to sin? Heaven hath\r\ngranted thee an open ignominy, that thereby thou mayest work out an\r\nopen triumph over the evil within thee and the sorrow without. Take\r\nheed how thou deniest to him—who, perchance, hath not the courage to\r\ngrasp it for himself—the bitter, but wholesome, cup that is now\r\npresented to thy lips!”\r\n\r\nThe young pastor’s voice was tremulously sweet, rich, deep, and broken.\r\nThe feeling that it so evidently manifested, rather than the direct\r\npurport of the words, caused it to vibrate within all hearts, and\r\nbrought the listeners into one accord of sympathy. Even the poor baby\r\nat Hester’s bosom was affected by the same influence, for it directed\r\nits hitherto vacant gaze towards Mr. Dimmesdale, and held up its little\r\narms with a half-pleased, half-plaintive murmur. So powerful seemed the\r\nminister’s appeal that the people could not believe but that Hester\r\nPrynne would speak out the guilty name, or else that the guilty one\r\nhimself in whatever high or lowly place he stood, would be drawn forth\r\nby an inward and inevitable necessity, and compelled to ascend the\r\nscaffold.\r\n\r\nHester shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Woman, transgress not beyond the limits of Heaven’s mercy!” cried the\r\nReverend Mr. Wilson, more harshly than before. “That little babe hath\r\nbeen gifted with a voice, to second and confirm the counsel which thou\r\nhast heard. Speak out the name! That, and thy repentance, may avail to\r\ntake the scarlet letter off thy breast.”\r\n\r\n“Never,” replied Hester Prynne, looking, not at Mr. Wilson, but into\r\nthe deep and troubled eyes of the younger clergyman. “It is too deeply\r\nbranded. Ye cannot take it off. And would that I might endure his agony\r\nas well as mine!”\r\n\r\n“Speak, woman!” said another voice, coldly and sternly, proceeding from\r\nthe crowd about the scaffold, “Speak; and give your child a father!”\r\n\r\n“I will not speak!” answered Hester, turning pale as death, but\r\nresponding to this voice, which she too surely recognised. “And my\r\nchild must seek a heavenly father; she shall never know an earthly\r\none!”\r\n\r\n“She will not speak!” murmured Mr. Dimmesdale, who, leaning over the\r\nbalcony, with his hand upon his heart, had awaited the result of his\r\nappeal. He now drew back with a long respiration. “Wondrous strength\r\nand generosity of a woman’s heart! She will not speak!”\r\n\r\nDiscerning the impracticable state of the poor culprit’s mind, the\r\nelder clergyman, who had carefully prepared himself for the occasion,\r\naddressed to the multitude a discourse on sin, in all its branches, but\r\nwith continual reference to the ignominious letter. So forcibly did he\r\ndwell upon this symbol, for the hour or more during which his periods\r\nwere rolling over the people’s heads, that it assumed new terrors in\r\ntheir imagination, and seemed to derive its scarlet hue from the flames\r\nof the infernal pit. Hester Prynne, meanwhile, kept her place upon the\r\npedestal of shame, with glazed eyes, and an air of weary indifference.\r\nShe had borne that morning all that nature could endure; and as her\r\ntemperament was not of the order that escapes from too intense\r\nsuffering by a swoon, her spirit could only shelter itself beneath a\r\nstony crust of insensibility, while the faculties of animal life\r\nremained entire. In this state, the voice of the preacher thundered\r\nremorselessly, but unavailingly, upon her ears. The infant, during the\r\nlatter portion of her ordeal, pierced the air with its wailings and\r\nscreams; she strove to hush it mechanically, but seemed scarcely to\r\nsympathise with its trouble. With the same hard demeanour, she was led\r\nback to prison, and vanished from the public gaze within its\r\niron-clamped portal. It was whispered by those who peered after her\r\nthat the scarlet letter threw a lurid gleam along the dark passage-way\r\nof the interior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nTHE INTERVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter her return to the prison, Hester Prynne was found to be in a\r\nstate of nervous excitement, that demanded constant watchfulness, lest\r\nshe should perpetrate violence on herself, or do some half-frenzied\r\nmischief to the poor babe. As night approached, it proving impossible\r\nto quell her insubordination by rebuke or threats of punishment, Master\r\nBrackett, the jailer, thought fit to introduce a physician. He\r\ndescribed him as a man of skill in all Christian modes of physical\r\nscience, and likewise familiar with whatever the savage people could\r\nteach in respect to medicinal herbs and roots that grew in the forest.\r\nTo say the truth, there was much need of professional assistance, not\r\nmerely for Hester herself, but still more urgently for the child—who,\r\ndrawing its sustenance from the maternal bosom, seemed to have drank in\r\nwith it all the turmoil, the anguish and despair, which pervaded the\r\nmother’s system. It now writhed in convulsions of pain, and was a\r\nforcible type, in its little frame, of the moral agony which Hester\r\nPrynne had borne throughout the day.\r\n\r\nClosely following the jailer into the dismal apartment, appeared that\r\nindividual, of singular aspect whose presence in the crowd had been of\r\nsuch deep interest to the wearer of the scarlet letter. He was lodged\r\nin the prison, not as suspected of any offence, but as the most\r\nconvenient and suitable mode of disposing of him, until the magistrates\r\nshould have conferred with the Indian sagamores respecting his ransom.\r\nHis name was announced as Roger Chillingworth. The jailer, after\r\nushering him into the room, remained a moment, marvelling at the\r\ncomparative quiet that followed his entrance; for Hester Prynne had\r\nimmediately become as still as death, although the child continued to\r\nmoan.\r\n\r\n“Prithee, friend, leave me alone with my patient,” said the\r\npractitioner. “Trust me, good jailer, you shall briefly have peace in\r\nyour house; and, I promise you, Mistress Prynne shall hereafter be more\r\namenable to just authority than you may have found her heretofore.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, if your worship can accomplish that,” answered Master Brackett,\r\n“I shall own you for a man of skill, indeed! Verily, the woman hath\r\nbeen like a possessed one; and there lacks little that I should take in\r\nhand, to drive Satan out of her with stripes.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger had entered the room with the characteristic quietude of\r\nthe profession to which he announced himself as belonging. Nor did his\r\ndemeanour change when the withdrawal of the prison keeper left him face\r\nto face with the woman, whose absorbed notice of him, in the crowd, had\r\nintimated so close a relation between himself and her. His first care\r\nwas given to the child, whose cries, indeed, as she lay writhing on the\r\ntrundle-bed, made it of peremptory necessity to postpone all other\r\nbusiness to the task of soothing her. He examined the infant carefully,\r\nand then proceeded to unclasp a leathern case, which he took from\r\nbeneath his dress. It appeared to contain medical preparations, one of\r\nwhich he mingled with a cup of water.\r\n\r\n“My old studies in alchemy,” observed he, “and my sojourn, for above a\r\nyear past, among a people well versed in the kindly properties of\r\nsimples, have made a better physician of me than many that claim the\r\nmedical degree. Here, woman! The child is yours—she is none of\r\nmine—neither will she recognise my voice or aspect as a father’s.\r\nAdminister this draught, therefore, with thine own hand.”\r\n\r\nHester repelled the offered medicine, at the same time gazing with\r\nstrongly marked apprehension into his face. “Wouldst thou avenge\r\nthyself on the innocent babe?” whispered she.\r\n\r\n“Foolish woman!” responded the physician, half coldly, half soothingly.\r\n“What should ail me to harm this misbegotten and miserable babe? The\r\nmedicine is potent for good, and were it my child—yea, mine own, as\r\nwell as thine! I could do no better for it.”\r\n\r\nAs she still hesitated, being, in fact, in no reasonable state of mind,\r\nhe took the infant in his arms, and himself administered the draught.\r\nIt soon proved its efficacy, and redeemed the leech’s pledge. The moans\r\nof the little patient subsided; its convulsive tossings gradually\r\nceased; and in a few moments, as is the custom of young children after\r\nrelief from pain, it sank into a profound and dewy slumber. The\r\nphysician, as he had a fair right to be termed, next bestowed his\r\nattention on the mother. With calm and intent scrutiny, he felt her\r\npulse, looked into her eyes—a gaze that made her heart shrink and\r\nshudder, because so familiar, and yet so strange and cold—and, finally,\r\nsatisfied with his investigation, proceeded to mingle another draught.\r\n\r\n“I know not Lethe nor Nepenthe,” remarked he; “but I have learned many\r\nnew secrets in the wilderness, and here is one of them—a recipe that an\r\nIndian taught me, in requital of some lessons of my own, that were as\r\nold as Paracelsus. Drink it! It may be less soothing than a sinless\r\nconscience. That I cannot give thee. But it will calm the swell and\r\nheaving of thy passion, like oil thrown on the waves of a tempestuous\r\nsea.”\r\n\r\nHe presented the cup to Hester, who received it with a slow, earnest\r\nlook into his face; not precisely a look of fear, yet full of doubt and\r\nquestioning as to what his purposes might be. She looked also at her\r\nslumbering child.\r\n\r\n“I have thought of death,” said she—“have wished for it—would even have\r\nprayed for it, were it fit that such as I should pray for anything.\r\nYet, if death be in this cup, I bid thee think again, ere thou\r\nbeholdest me quaff it. See! it is even now at my lips.”\r\n\r\n“Drink, then,” replied he, still with the same cold composure. “Dost\r\nthou know me so little, Hester Prynne? Are my purposes wont to be so\r\nshallow? Even if I imagine a scheme of vengeance, what could I do\r\nbetter for my object than to let thee live—than to give thee medicines\r\nagainst all harm and peril of life—so that this burning shame may still\r\nblaze upon thy bosom?” As he spoke, he laid his long forefinger on the\r\nscarlet letter, which forthwith seemed to scorch into Hester’s breast,\r\nas if it had been red hot. He noticed her involuntary gesture, and\r\nsmiled. “Live, therefore, and bear about thy doom with thee, in the\r\neyes of men and women—in the eyes of him whom thou didst call thy\r\nhusband—in the eyes of yonder child! And, that thou mayest live, take\r\noff this draught.”\r\n\r\nWithout further expostulation or delay, Hester Prynne drained the cup,\r\nand, at the motion of the man of skill, seated herself on the bed,\r\nwhere the child was sleeping; while he drew the only chair which the\r\nroom afforded, and took his own seat beside her. She could not but\r\ntremble at these preparations; for she felt that—having now done all\r\nthat humanity, or principle, or, if so it were, a refined cruelty,\r\nimpelled him to do for the relief of physical suffering—he was next to\r\ntreat with her as the man whom she had most deeply and irreparably\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\n“Hester,” said he, “I ask not wherefore, nor how thou hast fallen into\r\nthe pit, or say, rather, thou hast ascended to the pedestal of infamy\r\non which I found thee. The reason is not far to seek. It was my folly,\r\nand thy weakness. I—a man of thought—the book-worm of great libraries—a\r\nman already in decay, having given my best years to feed the hungry\r\ndream of knowledge—what had I to do with youth and beauty like thine\r\nown? Misshapen from my birth-hour, how could I delude myself with the\r\nidea that intellectual gifts might veil physical deformity in a young\r\ngirl’s fantasy? Men call me wise. If sages were ever wise in their own\r\nbehoof, I might have foreseen all this. I might have known that, as I\r\ncame out of the vast and dismal forest, and entered this settlement of\r\nChristian men, the very first object to meet my eyes would be thyself,\r\nHester Prynne, standing up, a statue of ignominy, before the people.\r\nNay, from the moment when we came down the old church-steps together, a\r\nmarried pair, I might have beheld the bale-fire of that scarlet letter\r\nblazing at the end of our path!”\r\n\r\n“Thou knowest,” said Hester—for, depressed as she was, she could not\r\nendure this last quiet stab at the token of her shame—“thou knowest\r\nthat I was frank with thee. I felt no love, nor feigned any.”\r\n\r\n“True,” replied he. “It was my folly! I have said it. But, up to that\r\nepoch of my life, I had lived in vain. The world had been so cheerless!\r\nMy heart was a habitation large enough for many guests, but lonely and\r\nchill, and without a household fire. I longed to kindle one! It seemed\r\nnot so wild a dream—old as I was, and sombre as I was, and misshapen as\r\nI was—that the simple bliss, which is scattered far and wide, for all\r\nmankind to gather up, might yet be mine. And so, Hester, I drew thee\r\ninto my heart, into its innermost chamber, and sought to warm thee by\r\nthe warmth which thy presence made there!”\r\n\r\n“I have greatly wronged thee,” murmured Hester.\r\n\r\n“We have wronged each other,” answered he. “Mine was the first wrong,\r\nwhen I betrayed thy budding youth into a false and unnatural relation\r\nwith my decay. Therefore, as a man who has not thought and\r\nphilosophised in vain, I seek no vengeance, plot no evil against thee.\r\nBetween thee and me, the scale hangs fairly balanced. But, Hester, the\r\nman lives who has wronged us both! Who is he?”\r\n\r\n“Ask me not!” replied Hester Prynne, looking firmly into his face.\r\n“That thou shalt never know!”\r\n\r\n“Never, sayest thou?” rejoined he, with a smile of dark and\r\nself-relying intelligence. “Never know him! Believe me, Hester, there\r\nare few things whether in the outward world, or, to a certain depth, in\r\nthe invisible sphere of thought—few things hidden from the man who\r\ndevotes himself earnestly and unreservedly to the solution of a\r\nmystery. Thou mayest cover up thy secret from the prying multitude.\r\nThou mayest conceal it, too, from the ministers and magistrates, even\r\nas thou didst this day, when they sought to wrench the name out of thy\r\nheart, and give thee a partner on thy pedestal. But, as for me, I come\r\nto the inquest with other senses than they possess. I shall seek this\r\nman, as I have sought truth in books: as I have sought gold in alchemy.\r\nThere is a sympathy that will make me conscious of him. I shall see him\r\ntremble. I shall feel myself shudder, suddenly and unawares. Sooner or\r\nlater, he must needs be mine.”\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the wrinkled scholar glowed so intensely upon her, that\r\nHester Prynne clasped her hand over her heart, dreading lest he should\r\nread the secret there at once.\r\n\r\n“Thou wilt not reveal his name? Not the less he is mine,” resumed he,\r\nwith a look of confidence, as if destiny were at one with him. “He\r\nbears no letter of infamy wrought into his garment, as thou dost, but I\r\nshall read it on his heart. Yet fear not for him! Think not that I\r\nshall interfere with Heaven’s own method of retribution, or, to my own\r\nloss, betray him to the gripe of human law. Neither do thou imagine\r\nthat I shall contrive aught against his life; no, nor against his fame,\r\nif as I judge, he be a man of fair repute. Let him live! Let him hide\r\nhimself in outward honour, if he may! Not the less he shall be mine!”\r\n\r\n“Thy acts are like mercy,” said Hester, bewildered and appalled; “but\r\nthy words interpret thee as a terror!”\r\n\r\n“One thing, thou that wast my wife, I would enjoin upon thee,”\r\ncontinued the scholar. “Thou hast kept the secret of thy paramour.\r\nKeep, likewise, mine! There are none in this land that know me. Breathe\r\nnot to any human soul that thou didst ever call me husband! Here, on\r\nthis wild outskirt of the earth, I shall pitch my tent; for, elsewhere\r\na wanderer, and isolated from human interests, I find here a woman, a\r\nman, a child, amongst whom and myself there exist the closest\r\nligaments. No matter whether of love or hate: no matter whether of\r\nright or wrong! Thou and thine, Hester Prynne, belong to me. My home is\r\nwhere thou art and where he is. But betray me not!”\r\n\r\n“Wherefore dost thou desire it?” inquired Hester, shrinking, she hardly\r\nknew why, from this secret bond. “Why not announce thyself openly, and\r\ncast me off at once?”\r\n\r\n“It may be,” he replied, “because I will not encounter the dishonour\r\nthat besmirches the husband of a faithless woman. It may be for other\r\nreasons. Enough, it is my purpose to live and die unknown. Let,\r\ntherefore, thy husband be to the world as one already dead, and of whom\r\nno tidings shall ever come. Recognise me not, by word, by sign, by\r\nlook! Breathe not the secret, above all, to the man thou wottest of.\r\nShouldst thou fail me in this, beware! His fame, his position, his life\r\nwill be in my hands. Beware!”\r\n\r\n“I will keep thy secret, as I have his,” said Hester.\r\n\r\n“Swear it!” rejoined he.\r\n\r\nAnd she took the oath.\r\n\r\n“And now, Mistress Prynne,” said old Roger Chillingworth, as he was\r\nhereafter to be named, “I leave thee alone: alone with thy infant and\r\nthe scarlet letter! How is it, Hester? Doth thy sentence bind thee to\r\nwear the token in thy sleep? Art thou not afraid of nightmares and\r\nhideous dreams?”\r\n\r\n“Why dost thou smile so at me?” inquired Hester, troubled at the\r\nexpression of his eyes. “Art thou like the Black Man that haunts the\r\nforest round about us? Hast thou enticed me into a bond that will prove\r\nthe ruin of my soul?”\r\n\r\n“Not thy soul,” he answered, with another smile. “No, not thine!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\nHESTER AT HER NEEDLE\r\n\r\n\r\nHester Prynne’s term of confinement was now at an end. Her prison-door\r\nwas thrown open, and she came forth into the sunshine, which, falling\r\non all alike, seemed, to her sick and morbid heart, as if meant for no\r\nother purpose than to reveal the scarlet letter on her breast. Perhaps\r\nthere was a more real torture in her first unattended footsteps from\r\nthe threshold of the prison than even in the procession and spectacle\r\nthat have been described, where she was made the common infamy, at\r\nwhich all mankind was summoned to point its finger. Then, she was\r\nsupported by an unnatural tension of the nerves, and by all the\r\ncombative energy of her character, which enabled her to convert the\r\nscene into a kind of lurid triumph. It was, moreover, a separate and\r\ninsulated event, to occur but once in her lifetime, and to meet which,\r\ntherefore, reckless of economy, she might call up the vital strength\r\nthat would have sufficed for many quiet years. The very law that\r\ncondemned her—a giant of stern features but with vigour to support, as\r\nwell as to annihilate, in his iron arm—had held her up through the\r\nterrible ordeal of her ignominy. But now, with this unattended walk\r\nfrom her prison door, began the daily custom; and she must either\r\nsustain and carry it forward by the ordinary resources of her nature,\r\nor sink beneath it. She could no longer borrow from the future to help\r\nher through the present grief. Tomorrow would bring its own trial with\r\nit; so would the next day, and so would the next: each its own trial,\r\nand yet the very same that was now so unutterably grievous to be borne.\r\nThe days of the far-off future would toil onward, still with the same\r\nburden for her to take up, and bear along with her, but never to fling\r\ndown; for the accumulating days and added years would pile up their\r\nmisery upon the heap of shame. Throughout them all, giving up her\r\nindividuality, she would become the general symbol at which the\r\npreacher and moralist might point, and in which they might vivify and\r\nembody their images of woman’s frailty and sinful passion. Thus the\r\nyoung and pure would be taught to look at her, with the scarlet letter\r\nflaming on her breast—at her, the child of honourable parents—at her,\r\nthe mother of a babe that would hereafter be a woman—at her, who had\r\nonce been innocent—as the figure, the body, the reality of sin. And\r\nover her grave, the infamy that she must carry thither would be her\r\nonly monument.\r\n\r\nIt may seem marvellous that, with the world before her—kept by no\r\nrestrictive clause of her condemnation within the limits of the Puritan\r\nsettlement, so remote and so obscure—free to return to her birth-place,\r\nor to any other European land, and there hide her character and\r\nidentity under a new exterior, as completely as if emerging into\r\nanother state of being—and having also the passes of the dark,\r\ninscrutable forest open to her, where the wildness of her nature might\r\nassimilate itself with a people whose customs and life were alien from\r\nthe law that had condemned her—it may seem marvellous that this woman\r\nshould still call that place her home, where, and where only, she must\r\nneeds be the type of shame. But there is a fatality, a feeling so\r\nirresistible and inevitable that it has the force of doom, which almost\r\ninvariably compels human beings to linger around and haunt, ghost-like,\r\nthe spot where some great and marked event has given the colour to\r\ntheir lifetime; and, still the more irresistibly, the darker the tinge\r\nthat saddens it. Her sin, her ignominy, were the roots which she had\r\nstruck into the soil. It was as if a new birth, with stronger\r\nassimilations than the first, had converted the forest-land, still so\r\nuncongenial to every other pilgrim and wanderer, into Hester Prynne’s\r\nwild and dreary, but life-long home. All other scenes of earth—even\r\nthat village of rural England, where happy infancy and stainless\r\nmaidenhood seemed yet to be in her mother’s keeping, like garments put\r\noff long ago—were foreign to her, in comparison. The chain that bound\r\nher here was of iron links, and galling to her inmost soul, but could\r\nnever be broken.\r\n\r\nIt might be, too—doubtless it was so, although she hid the secret from\r\nherself, and grew pale whenever it struggled out of her heart, like a\r\nserpent from its hole—it might be that another feeling kept her within\r\nthe scene and pathway that had been so fatal. There dwelt, there trode,\r\nthe feet of one with whom she deemed herself connected in a union that,\r\nunrecognised on earth, would bring them together before the bar of\r\nfinal judgment, and make that their marriage-altar, for a joint\r\nfuturity of endless retribution. Over and over again, the tempter of\r\nsouls had thrust this idea upon Hester’s contemplation, and laughed at\r\nthe passionate and desperate joy with which she seized, and then strove\r\nto cast it from her. She barely looked the idea in the face, and\r\nhastened to bar it in its dungeon. What she compelled herself to\r\nbelieve—what, finally, she reasoned upon as her motive for continuing a\r\nresident of New England—was half a truth, and half a self-delusion.\r\nHere, she said to herself had been the scene of her guilt, and here\r\nshould be the scene of her earthly punishment; and so, perchance, the\r\ntorture of her daily shame would at length purge her soul, and work out\r\nanother purity than that which she had lost: more saint-like, because\r\nthe result of martyrdom.\r\n\r\nHester Prynne, therefore, did not flee. On the outskirts of the town,\r\nwithin the verge of the peninsula, but not in close vicinity to any\r\nother habitation, there was a small thatched cottage. It had been built\r\nby an earlier settler, and abandoned, because the soil about it was too\r\nsterile for cultivation, while its comparative remoteness put it out of\r\nthe sphere of that social activity which already marked the habits of\r\nthe emigrants. It stood on the shore, looking across a basin of the sea\r\nat the forest-covered hills, towards the west. A clump of scrubby\r\ntrees, such as alone grew on the peninsula, did not so much conceal the\r\ncottage from view, as seem to denote that here was some object which\r\nwould fain have been, or at least ought to be, concealed. In this\r\nlittle lonesome dwelling, with some slender means that she possessed,\r\nand by the licence of the magistrates, who still kept an inquisitorial\r\nwatch over her, Hester established herself, with her infant child. A\r\nmystic shadow of suspicion immediately attached itself to the spot.\r\nChildren, too young to comprehend wherefore this woman should be shut\r\nout from the sphere of human charities, would creep nigh enough to\r\nbehold her plying her needle at the cottage-window, or standing in the\r\ndoorway, or labouring in her little garden, or coming forth along the\r\npathway that led townward, and, discerning the scarlet letter on her\r\nbreast, would scamper off with a strange contagious fear.\r\n\r\nLonely as was Hester’s situation, and without a friend on earth who\r\ndared to show himself, she, however, incurred no risk of want. She\r\npossessed an art that sufficed, even in a land that afforded\r\ncomparatively little scope for its exercise, to supply food for her\r\nthriving infant and herself. It was the art, then, as now, almost the\r\nonly one within a woman’s grasp—of needle-work. She bore on her breast,\r\nin the curiously embroidered letter, a specimen of her delicate and\r\nimaginative skill, of which the dames of a court might gladly have\r\navailed themselves, to add the richer and more spiritual adornment of\r\nhuman ingenuity to their fabrics of silk and gold. Here, indeed, in the\r\nsable simplicity that generally characterised the Puritanic modes of\r\ndress, there might be an infrequent call for the finer productions of\r\nher handiwork. Yet the taste of the age, demanding whatever was\r\nelaborate in compositions of this kind, did not fail to extend its\r\ninfluence over our stern progenitors, who had cast behind them so many\r\nfashions which it might seem harder to dispense with.\r\n\r\nPublic ceremonies, such as ordinations, the installation of\r\nmagistrates, and all that could give majesty to the forms in which a\r\nnew government manifested itself to the people, were, as a matter of\r\npolicy, marked by a stately and well-conducted ceremonial, and a\r\nsombre, but yet a studied magnificence. Deep ruffs, painfully wrought\r\nbands, and gorgeously embroidered gloves, were all deemed necessary to\r\nthe official state of men assuming the reins of power, and were readily\r\nallowed to individuals dignified by rank or wealth, even while\r\nsumptuary laws forbade these and similar extravagances to the plebeian\r\norder. In the array of funerals, too—whether for the apparel of the\r\ndead body, or to typify, by manifold emblematic devices of sable cloth\r\nand snowy lawn, the sorrow of the survivors—there was a frequent and\r\ncharacteristic demand for such labour as Hester Prynne could supply.\r\nBaby-linen—for babies then wore robes of state—afforded still another\r\npossibility of toil and emolument.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, not very slowly, her handiwork became what would now be\r\ntermed the fashion. Whether from commiseration for a woman of so\r\nmiserable a destiny; or from the morbid curiosity that gives a\r\nfictitious value even to common or worthless things; or by whatever\r\nother intangible circumstance was then, as now, sufficient to bestow,\r\non some persons, what others might seek in vain; or because Hester\r\nreally filled a gap which must otherwise have remained vacant; it is\r\ncertain that she had ready and fairly requited employment for as many\r\nhours as she saw fit to occupy with her needle. Vanity, it may be,\r\nchose to mortify itself, by putting on, for ceremonials of pomp and\r\nstate, the garments that had been wrought by her sinful hands. Her\r\nneedle-work was seen on the ruff of the Governor; military men wore it\r\non their scarfs, and the minister on his band; it decked the baby’s\r\nlittle cap; it was shut up, to be mildewed and moulder away, in the\r\ncoffins of the dead. But it is not recorded that, in a single instance,\r\nher skill was called in to embroider the white veil which was to cover\r\nthe pure blushes of a bride. The exception indicated the ever\r\nrelentless vigour with which society frowned upon her sin.\r\n\r\nHester sought not to acquire anything beyond a subsistence, of the\r\nplainest and most ascetic description, for herself, and a simple\r\nabundance for her child. Her own dress was of the coarsest materials\r\nand the most sombre hue, with only that one ornament—the scarlet\r\nletter—which it was her doom to wear. The child’s attire, on the other\r\nhand, was distinguished by a fanciful, or, we may rather say, a\r\nfantastic ingenuity, which served, indeed, to heighten the airy charm\r\nthat early began to develop itself in the little girl, but which\r\nappeared to have also a deeper meaning. We may speak further of it\r\nhereafter. Except for that small expenditure in the decoration of her\r\ninfant, Hester bestowed all her superfluous means in charity, on\r\nwretches less miserable than herself, and who not unfrequently insulted\r\nthe hand that fed them. Much of the time, which she might readily have\r\napplied to the better efforts of her art, she employed in making coarse\r\ngarments for the poor. It is probable that there was an idea of penance\r\nin this mode of occupation, and that she offered up a real sacrifice of\r\nenjoyment in devoting so many hours to such rude handiwork. She had in\r\nher nature a rich, voluptuous, Oriental characteristic—a taste for the\r\ngorgeously beautiful, which, save in the exquisite productions of her\r\nneedle, found nothing else, in all the possibilities of her life, to\r\nexercise itself upon. Women derive a pleasure, incomprehensible to the\r\nother sex, from the delicate toil of the needle. To Hester Prynne it\r\nmight have been a mode of expressing, and therefore soothing, the\r\npassion of her life. Like all other joys, she rejected it as sin. This\r\nmorbid meddling of conscience with an immaterial matter betokened, it\r\nis to be feared, no genuine and steadfast penitence, but something\r\ndoubtful, something that might be deeply wrong beneath.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, Hester Prynne came to have a part to perform in the\r\nworld. With her native energy of character and rare capacity, it could\r\nnot entirely cast her off, although it had set a mark upon her, more\r\nintolerable to a woman’s heart than that which branded the brow of\r\nCain. In all her intercourse with society, however, there was nothing\r\nthat made her feel as if she belonged to it. Every gesture, every word,\r\nand even the silence of those with whom she came in contact, implied,\r\nand often expressed, that she was banished, and as much alone as if she\r\ninhabited another sphere, or communicated with the common nature by\r\nother organs and senses than the rest of human kind. She stood apart\r\nfrom mortal interests, yet close beside them, like a ghost that\r\nrevisits the familiar fireside, and can no longer make itself seen or\r\nfelt; no more smile with the household joy, nor mourn with the kindred\r\nsorrow; or, should it succeed in manifesting its forbidden sympathy,\r\nawakening only terror and horrible repugnance. These emotions, in fact,\r\nand its bitterest scorn besides, seemed to be the sole portion that she\r\nretained in the universal heart. It was not an age of delicacy; and her\r\nposition, although she understood it well, and was in little danger of\r\nforgetting it, was often brought before her vivid self-perception, like\r\na new anguish, by the rudest touch upon the tenderest spot. The poor,\r\nas we have already said, whom she sought out to be the objects of her\r\nbounty, often reviled the hand that was stretched forth to succour\r\nthem. Dames of elevated rank, likewise, whose doors she entered in the\r\nway of her occupation, were accustomed to distil drops of bitterness\r\ninto her heart; sometimes through that alchemy of quiet malice, by\r\nwhich women can concoct a subtle poison from ordinary trifles; and\r\nsometimes, also, by a coarser expression, that fell upon the sufferer’s\r\ndefenceless breast like a rough blow upon an ulcerated wound. Hester\r\nhad schooled herself long and well; and she never responded to these\r\nattacks, save by a flush of crimson that rose irrepressibly over her\r\npale cheek, and again subsided into the depths of her bosom. She was\r\npatient—a martyr, indeed—but she forebore to pray for enemies, lest, in\r\nspite of her forgiving aspirations, the words of the blessing should\r\nstubbornly twist themselves into a curse.\r\n\r\nContinually, and in a thousand other ways, did she feel the innumerable\r\nthrobs of anguish that had been so cunningly contrived for her by the\r\nundying, the ever-active sentence of the Puritan tribunal. Clergymen\r\npaused in the streets, to address words of exhortation, that brought a\r\ncrowd, with its mingled grin and frown, around the poor, sinful woman.\r\nIf she entered a church, trusting to share the Sabbath smile of the\r\nUniversal Father, it was often her mishap to find herself the text of\r\nthe discourse. She grew to have a dread of children; for they had\r\nimbibed from their parents a vague idea of something horrible in this\r\ndreary woman gliding silently through the town, with never any\r\ncompanion but one only child. Therefore, first allowing her to pass,\r\nthey pursued her at a distance with shrill cries, and the utterances of\r\na word that had no distinct purport to their own minds, but was none\r\nthe less terrible to her, as proceeding from lips that babbled it\r\nunconsciously. It seemed to argue so wide a diffusion of her shame,\r\nthat all nature knew of it; it could have caused her no deeper pang had\r\nthe leaves of the trees whispered the dark story among themselves—had\r\nthe summer breeze murmured about it—had the wintry blast shrieked it\r\naloud! Another peculiar torture was felt in the gaze of a new eye. When\r\nstrangers looked curiously at the scarlet letter—and none ever failed\r\nto do so—they branded it afresh in Hester’s soul; so that, oftentimes,\r\nshe could scarcely refrain, yet always did refrain, from covering the\r\nsymbol with her hand. But then, again, an accustomed eye had likewise\r\nits own anguish to inflict. Its cool stare of familiarity was\r\nintolerable. From first to last, in short, Hester Prynne had always\r\nthis dreadful agony in feeling a human eye upon the token; the spot\r\nnever grew callous; it seemed, on the contrary, to grow more sensitive\r\nwith daily torture.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes, once in many days, or perchance in many months, she felt\r\nan eye—a human eye—upon the ignominious brand, that seemed to give a\r\nmomentary relief, as if half of her agony were shared. The next\r\ninstant, back it all rushed again, with still a deeper throb of pain;\r\nfor, in that brief interval, she had sinned anew. (Had Hester sinned\r\nalone?)\r\n\r\nHer imagination was somewhat affected, and, had she been of a softer\r\nmoral and intellectual fibre would have been still more so, by the\r\nstrange and solitary anguish of her life. Walking to and fro, with\r\nthose lonely footsteps, in the little world with which she was\r\noutwardly connected, it now and then appeared to Hester—if altogether\r\nfancy, it was nevertheless too potent to be resisted—she felt or\r\nfancied, then, that the scarlet letter had endowed her with a new\r\nsense. She shuddered to believe, yet could not help believing, that it\r\ngave her a sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts. She\r\nwas terror-stricken by the revelations that were thus made. What were\r\nthey? Could they be other than the insidious whispers of the bad angel,\r\nwho would fain have persuaded the struggling woman, as yet only half\r\nhis victim, that the outward guise of purity was but a lie, and that,\r\nif truth were everywhere to be shown, a scarlet letter would blaze\r\nforth on many a bosom besides Hester Prynne’s? Or, must she receive\r\nthose intimations—so obscure, yet so distinct—as truth? In all her\r\nmiserable experience, there was nothing else so awful and so loathsome\r\nas this sense. It perplexed, as well as shocked her, by the irreverent\r\ninopportuneness of the occasions that brought it into vivid action.\r\nSometimes the red infamy upon her breast would give a sympathetic\r\nthrob, as she passed near a venerable minister or magistrate, the model\r\nof piety and justice, to whom that age of antique reverence looked up,\r\nas to a mortal man in fellowship with angels. “What evil thing is at\r\nhand?” would Hester say to herself. Lifting her reluctant eyes, there\r\nwould be nothing human within the scope of view, save the form of this\r\nearthly saint! Again a mystic sisterhood would contumaciously assert\r\nitself, as she met the sanctified frown of some matron, who, according\r\nto the rumour of all tongues, had kept cold snow within her bosom\r\nthroughout life. That unsunned snow in the matron’s bosom, and the\r\nburning shame on Hester Prynne’s—what had the two in common? Or, once\r\nmore, the electric thrill would give her warning—“Behold Hester, here\r\nis a companion!” and, looking up, she would detect the eyes of a young\r\nmaiden glancing at the scarlet letter, shyly and aside, and quickly\r\naverted, with a faint, chill crimson in her cheeks as if her purity\r\nwere somewhat sullied by that momentary glance. O Fiend, whose talisman\r\nwas that fatal symbol, wouldst thou leave nothing, whether in youth or\r\nage, for this poor sinner to revere?—such loss of faith is ever one of\r\nthe saddest results of sin. Be it accepted as a proof that all was not\r\ncorrupt in this poor victim of her own frailty, and man’s hard law,\r\nthat Hester Prynne yet struggled to believe that no fellow-mortal was\r\nguilty like herself.\r\n\r\nThe vulgar, who, in those dreary old times, were always contributing a\r\ngrotesque horror to what interested their imaginations, had a story\r\nabout the scarlet letter which we might readily work up into a terrific\r\nlegend. They averred that the symbol was not mere scarlet cloth, tinged\r\nin an earthly dye-pot, but was red-hot with infernal fire, and could be\r\nseen glowing all alight whenever Hester Prynne walked abroad in the\r\nnight-time. And we must needs say it seared Hester’s bosom so deeply,\r\nthat perhaps there was more truth in the rumour than our modern\r\nincredulity may be inclined to admit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nPEARL\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have as yet hardly spoken of the infant; that little creature, whose\r\ninnocent life had sprung, by the inscrutable decree of Providence, a\r\nlovely and immortal flower, out of the rank luxuriance of a guilty\r\npassion. How strange it seemed to the sad woman, as she watched the\r\ngrowth, and the beauty that became every day more brilliant, and the\r\nintelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features\r\nof this child! Her Pearl—for so had Hester called her; not as a name\r\nexpressive of her aspect, which had nothing of the calm, white,\r\nunimpassioned lustre that would be indicated by the comparison. But she\r\nnamed the infant “Pearl,” as being of great price—purchased with all\r\nshe had—her mother’s only treasure! How strange, indeed! Man had marked\r\nthis woman’s sin by a scarlet letter, which had such potent and\r\ndisastrous efficacy that no human sympathy could reach her, save it\r\nwere sinful like herself. God, as a direct consequence of the sin which\r\nman thus punished, had given her a lovely child, whose place was on\r\nthat same dishonoured bosom, to connect her parent for ever with the\r\nrace and descent of mortals, and to be finally a blessed soul in\r\nheaven! Yet these thoughts affected Hester Prynne less with hope than\r\napprehension. She knew that her deed had been evil; she could have no\r\nfaith, therefore, that its result would be good. Day after day she\r\nlooked fearfully into the child’s expanding nature, ever dreading to\r\ndetect some dark and wild peculiarity that should correspond with the\r\nguiltiness to which she owed her being.\r\n\r\nCertainly there was no physical defect. By its perfect shape, its\r\nvigour, and its natural dexterity in the use of all its untried limbs,\r\nthe infant was worthy to have been brought forth in Eden: worthy to\r\nhave been left there to be the plaything of the angels after the\r\nworld’s first parents were driven out. The child had a native grace\r\nwhich does not invariably co-exist with faultless beauty; its attire,\r\nhowever simple, always impressed the beholder as if it were the very\r\ngarb that precisely became it best. But little Pearl was not clad in\r\nrustic weeds. Her mother, with a morbid purpose that may be better\r\nunderstood hereafter, had bought the richest tissues that could be\r\nprocured, and allowed her imaginative faculty its full play in the\r\narrangement and decoration of the dresses which the child wore before\r\nthe public eye. So magnificent was the small figure when thus arrayed,\r\nand such was the splendour of Pearl’s own proper beauty, shining\r\nthrough the gorgeous robes which might have extinguished a paler\r\nloveliness, that there was an absolute circle of radiance around her on\r\nthe darksome cottage floor. And yet a russet gown, torn and soiled with\r\nthe child’s rude play, made a picture of her just as perfect. Pearl’s\r\naspect was imbued with a spell of infinite variety; in this one child\r\nthere were many children, comprehending the full scope between the\r\nwild-flower prettiness of a peasant-baby, and the pomp, in little, of\r\nan infant princess. Throughout all, however, there was a trait of\r\npassion, a certain depth of hue, which she never lost; and if in any of\r\nher changes, she had grown fainter or paler, she would have ceased to\r\nbe herself—it would have been no longer Pearl!\r\n\r\nThis outward mutability indicated, and did not more than fairly\r\nexpress, the various properties of her inner life. Her nature appeared\r\nto possess depth, too, as well as variety; but—or else Hester’s fears\r\ndeceived her—it lacked reference and adaptation to the world into which\r\nshe was born. The child could not be made amenable to rules. In giving\r\nher existence a great law had been broken; and the result was a being\r\nwhose elements were perhaps beautiful and brilliant, but all in\r\ndisorder, or with an order peculiar to themselves, amidst which the\r\npoint of variety and arrangement was difficult or impossible to be\r\ndiscovered. Hester could only account for the child’s character—and\r\neven then most vaguely and imperfectly—by recalling what she herself\r\nhad been during that momentous period while Pearl was imbibing her soul\r\nfrom the spiritual world, and her bodily frame from its material of\r\nearth. The mother’s impassioned state had been the medium through which\r\nwere transmitted to the unborn infant the rays of its moral life; and,\r\nhowever white and clear originally, they had taken the deep stains of\r\ncrimson and gold, the fiery lustre, the black shadow, and the\r\nuntempered light of the intervening substance. Above all, the warfare\r\nof Hester’s spirit at that epoch was perpetuated in Pearl. She could\r\nrecognize her wild, desperate, defiant mood, the flightiness of her\r\ntemper, and even some of the very cloud-shapes of gloom and despondency\r\nthat had brooded in her heart. They were now illuminated by the morning\r\nradiance of a young child’s disposition, but, later in the day of\r\nearthly existence, might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind.\r\n\r\nThe discipline of the family in those days was of a far more rigid kind\r\nthan now. The frown, the harsh rebuke, the frequent application of the\r\nrod, enjoined by Scriptural authority, were used, not merely in the way\r\nof punishment for actual offences, but as a wholesome regimen for the\r\ngrowth and promotion of all childish virtues. Hester Prynne,\r\nnevertheless, the loving mother of this one child, ran little risk of\r\nerring on the side of undue severity. Mindful, however, of her own\r\nerrors and misfortunes, she early sought to impose a tender but strict\r\ncontrol over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge.\r\nBut the task was beyond her skill. After testing both smiles and\r\nfrowns, and proving that neither mode of treatment possessed any\r\ncalculable influence, Hester was ultimately compelled to stand aside\r\nand permit the child to be swayed by her own impulses. Physical\r\ncompulsion or restraint was effectual, of course, while it lasted. As\r\nto any other kind of discipline, whether addressed to her mind or\r\nheart, little Pearl might or might not be within its reach, in\r\naccordance with the caprice that ruled the moment. Her mother, while\r\nPearl was yet an infant, grew acquainted with a certain peculiar look,\r\nthat warned her when it would be labour thrown away to insist, persuade\r\nor plead.\r\n\r\nIt was a look so intelligent, yet inexplicable, perverse, sometimes so\r\nmalicious, but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits, that\r\nHester could not help questioning at such moments whether Pearl was a\r\nhuman child. She seemed rather an airy sprite, which, after playing its\r\nfantastic sports for a little while upon the cottage floor, would flit\r\naway with a mocking smile. Whenever that look appeared in her wild,\r\nbright, deeply black eyes, it invested her with a strange remoteness\r\nand intangibility: it was as if she were hovering in the air, and might\r\nvanish, like a glimmering light that comes we know not whence and goes\r\nwe know not whither. Beholding it, Hester was constrained to rush\r\ntowards the child—to pursue the little elf in the flight which she\r\ninvariably began—to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and\r\nearnest kisses—not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself\r\nthat Pearl was flesh and blood, and not utterly delusive. But Pearl’s\r\nlaugh, when she was caught, though full of merriment and music, made\r\nher mother more doubtful than before.\r\n\r\nHeart-smitten at this bewildering and baffling spell, that so often\r\ncame between herself and her sole treasure, whom she had bought so\r\ndear, and who was all her world, Hester sometimes burst into passionate\r\ntears. Then, perhaps—for there was no foreseeing how it might affect\r\nher—Pearl would frown, and clench her little fist, and harden her small\r\nfeatures into a stern, unsympathising look of discontent. Not seldom\r\nshe would laugh anew, and louder than before, like a thing incapable\r\nand unintelligent of human sorrow. Or—but this more rarely happened—she\r\nwould be convulsed with rage of grief and sob out her love for her\r\nmother in broken words, and seem intent on proving that she had a heart\r\nby breaking it. Yet Hester was hardly safe in confiding herself to that\r\ngusty tenderness: it passed as suddenly as it came. Brooding over all\r\nthese matters, the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit, but,\r\nby some irregularity in the process of conjuration, has failed to win\r\nthe master-word that should control this new and incomprehensible\r\nintelligence. Her only real comfort was when the child lay in the\r\nplacidity of sleep. Then she was sure of her, and tasted hours of\r\nquiet, sad, delicious happiness; until—perhaps with that perverse\r\nexpression glimmering from beneath her opening lids—little Pearl awoke!\r\n\r\nHow soon—with what strange rapidity, indeed—did Pearl arrive at an age\r\nthat was capable of social intercourse beyond the mother’s ever-ready\r\nsmile and nonsense-words! And then what a happiness would it have been\r\ncould Hester Prynne have heard her clear, bird-like voice mingling with\r\nthe uproar of other childish voices, and have distinguished and\r\nunravelled her own darling’s tones, amid all the entangled outcry of a\r\ngroup of sportive children. But this could never be. Pearl was a born\r\noutcast of the infantile world. An imp of evil, emblem and product of\r\nsin, she had no right among christened infants. Nothing was more\r\nremarkable than the instinct, as it seemed, with which the child\r\ncomprehended her loneliness: the destiny that had drawn an inviolable\r\ncircle round about her: the whole peculiarity, in short, of her\r\nposition in respect to other children. Never since her release from\r\nprison had Hester met the public gaze without her. In all her walks\r\nabout the town, Pearl, too, was there: first as the babe in arms, and\r\nafterwards as the little girl, small companion of her mother, holding a\r\nforefinger with her whole grasp, and tripping along at the rate of\r\nthree or four footsteps to one of Hester’s. She saw the children of the\r\nsettlement on the grassy margin of the street, or at the domestic\r\nthresholds, disporting themselves in such grim fashions as the\r\nPuritanic nurture would permit; playing at going to church, perchance,\r\nor at scourging Quakers; or taking scalps in a sham fight with the\r\nIndians, or scaring one another with freaks of imitative witchcraft.\r\nPearl saw, and gazed intently, but never sought to make acquaintance.\r\nIf spoken to, she would not speak again. If the children gathered about\r\nher, as they sometimes did, Pearl would grow positively terrible in her\r\npuny wrath, snatching up stones to fling at them, with shrill,\r\nincoherent exclamations, that made her mother tremble, because they had\r\nso much the sound of a witch’s anathemas in some unknown tongue.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, that the little Puritans, being of the most intolerant\r\nbrood that ever lived, had got a vague idea of something outlandish,\r\nunearthly, or at variance with ordinary fashions, in the mother and\r\nchild, and therefore scorned them in their hearts, and not unfrequently\r\nreviled them with their tongues. Pearl felt the sentiment, and requited\r\nit with the bitterest hatred that can be supposed to rankle in a\r\nchildish bosom. These outbreaks of a fierce temper had a kind of value,\r\nand even comfort for the mother; because there was at least an\r\nintelligible earnestness in the mood, instead of the fitful caprice\r\nthat so often thwarted her in the child’s manifestations. It appalled\r\nher, nevertheless, to discern here, again, a shadowy reflection of the\r\nevil that had existed in herself. All this enmity and passion had Pearl\r\ninherited, by inalienable right, out of Hester’s heart. Mother and\r\ndaughter stood together in the same circle of seclusion from human\r\nsociety; and in the nature of the child seemed to be perpetuated those\r\nunquiet elements that had distracted Hester Prynne before Pearl’s\r\nbirth, but had since begun to be soothed away by the softening\r\ninfluences of maternity.\r\n\r\nAt home, within and around her mother’s cottage, Pearl wanted not a\r\nwide and various circle of acquaintance. The spell of life went forth\r\nfrom her ever-creative spirit, and communicated itself to a thousand\r\nobjects, as a torch kindles a flame wherever it may be applied. The\r\nunlikeliest materials—a stick, a bunch of rags, a flower—were the\r\npuppets of Pearl’s witchcraft, and, without undergoing any outward\r\nchange, became spiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the stage\r\nof her inner world. Her one baby-voice served a multitude of imaginary\r\npersonages, old and young, to talk withal. The pine-trees, aged, black,\r\nand solemn, and flinging groans and other melancholy utterances on the\r\nbreeze, needed little transformation to figure as Puritan elders; the\r\nugliest weeds of the garden were their children, whom Pearl smote down\r\nand uprooted most unmercifully. It was wonderful, the vast variety of\r\nforms into which she threw her intellect, with no continuity, indeed,\r\nbut darting up and dancing, always in a state of preternatural\r\nactivity—soon sinking down, as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a\r\ntide of life—and succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild energy. It\r\nwas like nothing so much as the phantasmagoric play of the northern\r\nlights. In the mere exercise of the fancy, however, and the\r\nsportiveness of a growing mind, there might be a little more than was\r\nobservable in other children of bright faculties; except as Pearl, in\r\nthe dearth of human playmates, was thrown more upon the visionary\r\nthrong which she created. The singularity lay in the hostile feelings\r\nwith which the child regarded all these offsprings of her own heart and\r\nmind. She never created a friend, but seemed always to be sowing\r\nbroadcast the dragon’s teeth, whence sprung a harvest of armed enemies,\r\nagainst whom she rushed to battle. It was inexpressibly sad—then what\r\ndepth of sorrow to a mother, who felt in her own heart the cause—to\r\nobserve, in one so young, this constant recognition of an adverse\r\nworld, and so fierce a training of the energies that were to make good\r\nher cause in the contest that must ensue.\r\n\r\nGazing at Pearl, Hester Prynne often dropped her work upon her knees,\r\nand cried out with an agony which she would fain have hidden, but which\r\nmade utterance for itself betwixt speech and a groan—“O Father in\r\nHeaven—if Thou art still my Father—what is this being which I have\r\nbrought into the world?” And Pearl, overhearing the ejaculation, or\r\naware through some more subtile channel, of those throbs of anguish,\r\nwould turn her vivid and beautiful little face upon her mother, smile\r\nwith sprite-like intelligence, and resume her play.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity of the child’s deportment remains yet to be told. The\r\nvery first thing which she had noticed in her life, was—what?—not the\r\nmother’s smile, responding to it, as other babies do, by that faint,\r\nembryo smile of the little mouth, remembered so doubtfully afterwards,\r\nand with such fond discussion whether it were indeed a smile. By no\r\nmeans! But that first object of which Pearl seemed to become aware\r\nwas—shall we say it?—the scarlet letter on Hester’s bosom! One day, as\r\nher mother stooped over the cradle, the infant’s eyes had been caught\r\nby the glimmering of the gold embroidery about the letter; and putting\r\nup her little hand she grasped at it, smiling, not doubtfully, but with\r\na decided gleam, that gave her face the look of a much older child.\r\nThen, gasping for breath, did Hester Prynne clutch the fatal token,\r\ninstinctively endeavouring to tear it away, so infinite was the torture\r\ninflicted by the intelligent touch of Pearl’s baby-hand. Again, as if\r\nher mother’s agonised gesture were meant only to make sport for her,\r\ndid little Pearl look into her eyes, and smile. From that epoch, except\r\nwhen the child was asleep, Hester had never felt a moment’s safety: not\r\na moment’s calm enjoyment of her. Weeks, it is true, would sometimes\r\nelapse, during which Pearl’s gaze might never once be fixed upon the\r\nscarlet letter; but then, again, it would come at unawares, like the\r\nstroke of sudden death, and always with that peculiar smile and odd\r\nexpression of the eyes.\r\n\r\nOnce this freakish, elvish cast came into the child’s eyes while Hester\r\nwas looking at her own image in them, as mothers are fond of doing; and\r\nsuddenly—for women in solitude, and with troubled hearts, are pestered\r\nwith unaccountable delusions—she fancied that she beheld, not her own\r\nminiature portrait, but another face in the small black mirror of\r\nPearl’s eye. It was a face, fiend-like, full of smiling malice, yet\r\nbearing the semblance of features that she had known full well, though\r\nseldom with a smile, and never with malice in them. It was as if an\r\nevil spirit possessed the child, and had just then peeped forth in\r\nmockery. Many a time afterwards had Hester been tortured, though less\r\nvividly, by the same illusion.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of a certain summer’s day, after Pearl grew big enough\r\nto run about, she amused herself with gathering handfuls of wild\r\nflowers, and flinging them, one by one, at her mother’s bosom; dancing\r\nup and down like a little elf whenever she hit the scarlet letter.\r\nHester’s first motion had been to cover her bosom with her clasped\r\nhands. But whether from pride or resignation, or a feeling that her\r\npenance might best be wrought out by this unutterable pain, she\r\nresisted the impulse, and sat erect, pale as death, looking sadly into\r\nlittle Pearl’s wild eyes. Still came the battery of flowers, almost\r\ninvariably hitting the mark, and covering the mother’s breast with\r\nhurts for which she could find no balm in this world, nor knew how to\r\nseek it in another. At last, her shot being all expended, the child\r\nstood still and gazed at Hester, with that little laughing image of a\r\nfiend peeping out—or, whether it peeped or no, her mother so imagined\r\nit—from the unsearchable abyss of her black eyes.\r\n\r\n“Child, what art thou?” cried the mother.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am your little Pearl!” answered the child.\r\n\r\nBut while she said it, Pearl laughed, and began to dance up and down\r\nwith the humoursome gesticulation of a little imp, whose next freak\r\nmight be to fly up the chimney.\r\n\r\n“Art thou my child, in very truth?” asked Hester.\r\n\r\nNor did she put the question altogether idly, but, for the moment, with\r\na portion of genuine earnestness; for, such was Pearl’s wonderful\r\nintelligence, that her mother half doubted whether she were not\r\nacquainted with the secret spell of her existence, and might not now\r\nreveal herself.\r\n\r\n“Yes; I am little Pearl!” repeated the child, continuing her antics.\r\n\r\n“Thou art not my child! Thou art no Pearl of mine!” said the mother\r\nhalf playfully; for it was often the case that a sportive impulse came\r\nover her in the midst of her deepest suffering. “Tell me, then, what\r\nthou art, and who sent thee hither?”\r\n\r\n“Tell me, mother!” said the child, seriously, coming up to Hester, and\r\npressing herself close to her knees. “Do thou tell me!”\r\n\r\n“Thy Heavenly Father sent thee!” answered Hester Prynne.\r\n\r\nBut she said it with a hesitation that did not escape the acuteness of\r\nthe child. Whether moved only by her ordinary freakishness, or because\r\nan evil spirit prompted her, she put up her small forefinger and\r\ntouched the scarlet letter.\r\n\r\n“He did not send me!” cried she, positively. “I have no Heavenly\r\nFather!”\r\n\r\n“Hush, Pearl, hush! Thou must not talk so!” answered the mother,\r\nsuppressing a groan. “He sent us all into the world. He sent even me,\r\nthy mother. Then, much more thee! Or, if not, thou strange and elfish\r\nchild, whence didst thou come?”\r\n\r\n“Tell me! Tell me!” repeated Pearl, no longer seriously, but laughing\r\nand capering about the floor. “It is thou that must tell me!”\r\n\r\nBut Hester could not resolve the query, being herself in a dismal\r\nlabyrinth of doubt. She remembered—betwixt a smile and a shudder—the\r\ntalk of the neighbouring townspeople, who, seeking vainly elsewhere for\r\nthe child’s paternity, and observing some of her odd attributes, had\r\ngiven out that poor little Pearl was a demon offspring: such as, ever\r\nsince old Catholic times, had occasionally been seen on earth, through\r\nthe agency of their mother’s sin, and to promote some foul and wicked\r\npurpose. Luther, according to the scandal of his monkish enemies, was a\r\nbrat of that hellish breed; nor was Pearl the only child to whom this\r\ninauspicious origin was assigned among the New England Puritans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nTHE GOVERNOR’S HALL\r\n\r\n\r\nHester Prynne went one day to the mansion of Governor Bellingham, with\r\na pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order,\r\nand which were to be worn on some great occasion of state; for, though\r\nthe chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to\r\ndescend a step or two from the highest rank, he still held an\r\nhonourable and influential place among the colonial magistracy.\r\n\r\nAnother and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of\r\nembroidered gloves, impelled Hester, at this time, to seek an interview\r\nwith a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the\r\nsettlement. It had reached her ears that there was a design on the part\r\nof some of the leading inhabitants, cherishing the more rigid order of\r\nprinciples in religion and government, to deprive her of her child. On\r\nthe supposition that Pearl, as already hinted, was of demon origin,\r\nthese good people not unreasonably argued that a Christian interest in\r\nthe mother’s soul required them to remove such a stumbling-block from\r\nher path. If the child, on the other hand, were really capable of moral\r\nand religious growth, and possessed the elements of ultimate salvation,\r\nthen, surely, it would enjoy all the fairer prospect of these\r\nadvantages by being transferred to wiser and better guardianship than\r\nHester Prynne’s. Among those who promoted the design, Governor\r\nBellingham was said to be one of the most busy. It may appear singular,\r\nand, indeed, not a little ludicrous, that an affair of this kind, which\r\nin later days would have been referred to no higher jurisdiction than\r\nthat of the select men of the town, should then have been a question\r\npublicly discussed, and on which statesmen of eminence took sides. At\r\nthat epoch of pristine simplicity, however, matters of even slighter\r\npublic interest, and of far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of\r\nHester and her child, were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of\r\nlegislators and acts of state. The period was hardly, if at all,\r\nearlier than that of our story, when a dispute concerning the right of\r\nproperty in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the\r\nlegislative body of the colony, but resulted in an important\r\nmodification of the framework itself of the legislature.\r\n\r\nFull of concern, therefore—but so conscious of her own right that it\r\nseemed scarcely an unequal match between the public on the one side,\r\nand a lonely woman, backed by the sympathies of nature, on the\r\nother—Hester Prynne set forth from her solitary cottage. Little Pearl,\r\nof course, was her companion. She was now of an age to run lightly\r\nalong by her mother’s side, and, constantly in motion from morn till\r\nsunset, could have accomplished a much longer journey than that before\r\nher. Often, nevertheless, more from caprice than necessity, she\r\ndemanded to be taken up in arms; but was soon as imperious to be let\r\ndown again, and frisked onward before Hester on the grassy pathway,\r\nwith many a harmless trip and tumble. We have spoken of Pearl’s rich\r\nand luxuriant beauty—a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints, a\r\nbright complexion, eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow,\r\nand hair already of a deep, glossy brown, and which, in after years,\r\nwould be nearly akin to black. There was fire in her and throughout\r\nher: she seemed the unpremeditated offshoot of a passionate moment. Her\r\nmother, in contriving the child’s garb, had allowed the gorgeous\r\ntendencies of her imagination their full play, arraying her in a\r\ncrimson velvet tunic of a peculiar cut, abundantly embroidered in\r\nfantasies and flourishes of gold thread. So much strength of colouring,\r\nwhich must have given a wan and pallid aspect to cheeks of a fainter\r\nbloom, was admirably adapted to Pearl’s beauty, and made her the very\r\nbrightest little jet of flame that ever danced upon the earth.\r\n\r\nBut it was a remarkable attribute of this garb, and indeed, of the\r\nchild’s whole appearance, that it irresistibly and inevitably reminded\r\nthe beholder of the token which Hester Prynne was doomed to wear upon\r\nher bosom. It was the scarlet letter in another form: the scarlet\r\nletter endowed with life! The mother herself—as if the red ignominy\r\nwere so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed\r\nits form—had carefully wrought out the similitude, lavishing many hours\r\nof morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the object of her\r\naffection and the emblem of her guilt and torture. But, in truth, Pearl\r\nwas the one as well as the other; and only in consequence of that\r\nidentity had Hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet\r\nletter in her appearance.\r\n\r\nAs the two wayfarers came within the precincts of the town, the\r\nchildren of the Puritans looked up from their play,—or what passed for\r\nplay with those sombre little urchins—and spoke gravely one to another.\r\n\r\n“Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlet letter: and of a\r\ntruth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlet letter running\r\nalong by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!”\r\n\r\nBut Pearl, who was a dauntless child, after frowning, stamping her\r\nfoot, and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening\r\ngestures, suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies, and put them\r\nall to flight. She resembled, in her fierce pursuit of them, an infant\r\npestilence—the scarlet fever, or some such half-fledged angel of\r\njudgment—whose mission was to punish the sins of the rising generation.\r\nShe screamed and shouted, too, with a terrific volume of sound, which,\r\ndoubtless, caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them. The\r\nvictory accomplished, Pearl returned quietly to her mother, and looked\r\nup, smiling, into her face.\r\n\r\nWithout further adventure, they reached the dwelling of Governor\r\nBellingham. This was a large wooden house, built in a fashion of which\r\nthere are specimens still extant in the streets of our older towns now\r\nmoss-grown, crumbling to decay, and melancholy at heart with the many\r\nsorrowful or joyful occurrences, remembered or forgotten, that have\r\nhappened and passed away within their dusky chambers. Then, however,\r\nthere was the freshness of the passing year on its exterior, and the\r\ncheerfulness, gleaming forth from the sunny windows, of a human\r\nhabitation, into which death had never entered. It had, indeed, a very\r\ncheery aspect, the walls being overspread with a kind of stucco, in\r\nwhich fragments of broken glass were plentifully intermixed; so that,\r\nwhen the sunshine fell aslant-wise over the front of the edifice, it\r\nglittered and sparkled as if diamonds had been flung against it by the\r\ndouble handful. The brilliancy might have befitted Aladdin’s palace\r\nrather than the mansion of a grave old Puritan ruler. It was further\r\ndecorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams,\r\nsuitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the\r\nstucco, when newly laid on, and had now grown hard and durable, for the\r\nadmiration of after times.\r\n\r\nPearl, looking at this bright wonder of a house began to caper and\r\ndance, and imperatively required that the whole breadth of sunshine\r\nshould be stripped off its front, and given her to play with.\r\n\r\n“No, my little Pearl!” said her mother; “thou must gather thine own\r\nsunshine. I have none to give thee!”\r\n\r\nThey approached the door, which was of an arched form, and flanked on\r\neach side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice, in both of\r\nwhich were lattice-windows, the wooden shutters to close over them at\r\nneed. Lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal, Hester Prynne\r\ngave a summons, which was answered by one of the Governor’s\r\nbond-servants—a free-born Englishman, but now a seven years’ slave.\r\nDuring that term he was to be the property of his master, and as much a\r\ncommodity of bargain and sale as an ox, or a joint-stool. The serf wore\r\nthe customary garb of serving-men at that period, and long before, in\r\nthe old hereditary halls of England.\r\n\r\n“Is the worshipful Governor Bellingham within?” inquired Hester.\r\n\r\n“Yea, forsooth,” replied the bond-servant, staring with wide-open eyes\r\nat the scarlet letter, which, being a new-comer in the country, he had\r\nnever before seen. “Yea, his honourable worship is within. But he hath\r\na godly minister or two with him, and likewise a leech. Ye may not see\r\nhis worship now.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, I will enter,” answered Hester Prynne; and the\r\nbond-servant, perhaps judging from the decision of her air, and the\r\nglittering symbol in her bosom, that she was a great lady in the land,\r\noffered no opposition.\r\n\r\nSo the mother and little Pearl were admitted into the hall of entrance.\r\nWith many variations, suggested by the nature of his building\r\nmaterials, diversity of climate, and a different mode of social life,\r\nGovernor Bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences\r\nof gentlemen of fair estate in his native land. Here, then, was a wide\r\nand reasonably lofty hall, extending through the whole depth of the\r\nhouse, and forming a medium of general communication, more or less\r\ndirectly, with all the other apartments. At one extremity, this\r\nspacious room was lighted by the windows of the two towers, which\r\nformed a small recess on either side of the portal. At the other end,\r\nthough partly muffled by a curtain, it was more powerfully illuminated\r\nby one of those embowed hall windows which we read of in old books, and\r\nwhich was provided with a deep and cushioned seat. Here, on the\r\ncushion, lay a folio tome, probably of the Chronicles of England, or\r\nother such substantial literature; even as, in our own days, we scatter\r\ngilded volumes on the centre table, to be turned over by the casual\r\nguest. The furniture of the hall consisted of some ponderous chairs,\r\nthe backs of which were elaborately carved with wreaths of oaken\r\nflowers; and likewise a table in the same taste, the whole being of the\r\nElizabethan age, or perhaps earlier, and heirlooms, transferred hither\r\nfrom the Governor’s paternal home. On the table—in token that the\r\nsentiment of old English hospitality had not been left behind—stood a\r\nlarge pewter tankard, at the bottom of which, had Hester or Pearl\r\npeeped into it, they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent\r\ndraught of ale.\r\n\r\nOn the wall hung a row of portraits, representing the forefathers of\r\nthe Bellingham lineage, some with armour on their breasts, and others\r\nwith stately ruffs and robes of peace. All were characterised by the\r\nsternness and severity which old portraits so invariably put on, as if\r\nthey were the ghosts, rather than the pictures, of departed worthies,\r\nand were gazing with harsh and intolerant criticism at the pursuits and\r\nenjoyments of living men.\r\n\r\nAt about the centre of the oaken panels that lined the hall was\r\nsuspended a suit of mail, not, like the pictures, an ancestral relic,\r\nbut of the most modern date; for it had been manufactured by a skilful\r\narmourer in London, the same year in which Governor Bellingham came\r\nover to New England. There was a steel head-piece, a cuirass, a gorget\r\nand greaves, with a pair of gauntlets and a sword hanging beneath; all,\r\nand especially the helmet and breastplate, so highly burnished as to\r\nglow with white radiance, and scatter an illumination everywhere about\r\nupon the floor. This bright panoply was not meant for mere idle show,\r\nbut had been worn by the Governor on many a solemn muster and training\r\nfield, and had glittered, moreover, at the head of a regiment in the\r\nPequod war. For, though bred a lawyer, and accustomed to speak of\r\nBacon, Coke, Noye, and Finch, as his professional associates, the\r\nexigencies of this new country had transformed Governor Bellingham into\r\na soldier, as well as a statesman and ruler.\r\n\r\nLittle Pearl, who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armour as\r\nshe had been with the glittering frontispiece of the house, spent some\r\ntime looking into the polished mirror of the breastplate.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” cried she, “I see you here. Look! Look!”\r\n\r\nHester looked by way of humouring the child; and she saw that, owing to\r\nthe peculiar effect of this convex mirror, the scarlet letter was\r\nrepresented in exaggerated and gigantic proportions, so as to be\r\ngreatly the most prominent feature of her appearance. In truth, she\r\nseemed absolutely hidden behind it. Pearl pointed upwards also, at a\r\nsimilar picture in the head-piece; smiling at her mother, with the\r\nelfish intelligence that was so familiar an expression on her small\r\nphysiognomy. That look of naughty merriment was likewise reflected in\r\nthe mirror, with so much breadth and intensity of effect, that it made\r\nHester Prynne feel as if it could not be the image of her own child,\r\nbut of an imp who was seeking to mould itself into Pearl’s shape.\r\n\r\n“Come along, Pearl,” said she, drawing her away, “Come and look into\r\nthis fair garden. It may be we shall see flowers there; more beautiful\r\nones than we find in the woods.”\r\n\r\nPearl accordingly ran to the bow-window, at the further end of the\r\nhall, and looked along the vista of a garden walk, carpeted with\r\nclosely-shaven grass, and bordered with some rude and immature attempt\r\nat shrubbery. But the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished\r\nas hopeless, the effort to perpetuate on this side of the Atlantic, in\r\na hard soil, and amid the close struggle for subsistence, the native\r\nEnglish taste for ornamental gardening. Cabbages grew in plain sight;\r\nand a pumpkin-vine, rooted at some distance, had run across the\r\nintervening space, and deposited one of its gigantic products directly\r\nbeneath the hall window, as if to warn the Governor that this great\r\nlump of vegetable gold was as rich an ornament as New England earth\r\nwould offer him. There were a few rose-bushes, however, and a number of\r\napple-trees, probably the descendants of those planted by the Reverend\r\nMr. Blackstone, the first settler of the peninsula; that half\r\nmythological personage who rides through our early annals, seated on\r\nthe back of a bull.\r\n\r\nPearl, seeing the rose-bushes, began to cry for a red rose, and would\r\nnot be pacified.\r\n\r\n“Hush, child—hush!” said her mother, earnestly. “Do not cry, dear\r\nlittle Pearl! I hear voices in the garden. The Governor is coming, and\r\ngentlemen along with him.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, adown the vista of the garden avenue, a number of persons were\r\nseen approaching towards the house. Pearl, in utter scorn of her\r\nmother’s attempt to quiet her, gave an eldritch scream, and then became\r\nsilent, not from any notion of obedience, but because the quick and\r\nmobile curiosity of her disposition was excited by the appearance of\r\nthose new personages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nTHE ELF-CHILD AND THE MINISTER\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Bellingham, in a loose gown and easy cap—such as elderly\r\ngentlemen loved to endue themselves with, in their domestic\r\nprivacy—walked foremost, and appeared to be showing off his estate, and\r\nexpatiating on his projected improvements. The wide circumference of an\r\nelaborate ruff, beneath his grey beard, in the antiquated fashion of\r\nKing James’s reign, caused his head to look not a little like that of\r\nJohn the Baptist in a charger. The impression made by his aspect, so\r\nrigid and severe, and frost-bitten with more than autumnal age, was\r\nhardly in keeping with the appliances of worldly enjoyment wherewith he\r\nhad evidently done his utmost to surround himself. But it is an error\r\nto suppose that our great forefathers—though accustomed to speak and\r\nthink of human existence as a state merely of trial and warfare, and\r\nthough unfeignedly prepared to sacrifice goods and life at the behest\r\nof duty—made it a matter of conscience to reject such means of comfort,\r\nor even luxury, as lay fairly within their grasp. This creed was never\r\ntaught, for instance, by the venerable pastor, John Wilson, whose\r\nbeard, white as a snow-drift, was seen over Governor Bellingham’s\r\nshoulders, while its wearer suggested that pears and peaches might yet\r\nbe naturalised in the New England climate, and that purple grapes might\r\npossibly be compelled to flourish against the sunny garden-wall. The\r\nold clergyman, nurtured at the rich bosom of the English Church, had a\r\nlong established and legitimate taste for all good and comfortable\r\nthings, and however stern he might show himself in the pulpit, or in\r\nhis public reproof of such transgressions as that of Hester Prynne,\r\nstill, the genial benevolence of his private life had won him warmer\r\naffection than was accorded to any of his professional contemporaries.\r\n\r\nBehind the Governor and Mr. Wilson came two other guests—one, the\r\nReverend Arthur Dimmesdale, whom the reader may remember as having\r\ntaken a brief and reluctant part in the scene of Hester Prynne’s\r\ndisgrace; and, in close companionship with him, old Roger\r\nChillingworth, a person of great skill in physic, who for two or three\r\nyears past had been settled in the town. It was understood that this\r\nlearned man was the physician as well as friend of the young minister,\r\nwhose health had severely suffered of late by his too unreserved\r\nself-sacrifice to the labours and duties of the pastoral relation.\r\n\r\nThe Governor, in advance of his visitors, ascended one or two steps,\r\nand, throwing open the leaves of the great hall window, found himself\r\nclose to little Pearl. The shadow of the curtain fell on Hester Prynne,\r\nand partially concealed her.\r\n\r\n“What have we here?” said Governor Bellingham, looking with surprise at\r\nthe scarlet little figure before him. “I profess, I have never seen the\r\nlike since my days of vanity, in old King James’s time, when I was wont\r\nto esteem it a high favour to be admitted to a court mask! There used\r\nto be a swarm of these small apparitions in holiday time, and we called\r\nthem children of the Lord of Misrule. But how gat such a guest into my\r\nhall?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, indeed!” cried good old Mr. Wilson. “What little bird of scarlet\r\nplumage may this be? Methinks I have seen just such figures when the\r\nsun has been shining through a richly painted window, and tracing out\r\nthe golden and crimson images across the floor. But that was in the old\r\nland. Prithee, young one, who art thou, and what has ailed thy mother\r\nto bedizen thee in this strange fashion? Art thou a Christian child—ha?\r\nDost know thy catechism? Or art thou one of those naughty elfs or\r\nfairies whom we thought to have left behind us, with other relics of\r\nPapistry, in merry old England?”\r\n\r\n“I am mother’s child,” answered the scarlet vision, “and my name is\r\nPearl!”\r\n\r\n“Pearl?—Ruby, rather—or Coral!—or Red Rose, at the very least, judging\r\nfrom thy hue!” responded the old minister, putting forth his hand in a\r\nvain attempt to pat little Pearl on the cheek. “But where is this\r\nmother of thine? Ah! I see,” he added; and, turning to Governor\r\nBellingham, whispered, “This is the selfsame child of whom we have held\r\nspeech together; and behold here the unhappy woman, Hester Prynne, her\r\nmother!”\r\n\r\n“Sayest thou so?” cried the Governor. “Nay, we might have judged that\r\nsuch a child’s mother must needs be a scarlet woman, and a worthy type\r\nof her of Babylon! But she comes at a good time, and we will look into\r\nthis matter forthwith.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Bellingham stepped through the window into the hall, followed\r\nby his three guests.\r\n\r\n“Hester Prynne,” said he, fixing his naturally stern regard on the\r\nwearer of the scarlet letter, “there hath been much question concerning\r\nthee of late. The point hath been weightily discussed, whether we, that\r\nare of authority and influence, do well discharge our consciences by\r\ntrusting an immortal soul, such as there is in yonder child, to the\r\nguidance of one who hath stumbled and fallen amid the pitfalls of this\r\nworld. Speak thou, the child’s own mother! Were it not, thinkest thou,\r\nfor thy little one’s temporal and eternal welfare that she be taken out\r\nof thy charge, and clad soberly, and disciplined strictly, and\r\ninstructed in the truths of heaven and earth? What canst thou do for\r\nthe child in this kind?”\r\n\r\n“I can teach my little Pearl what I have learned from this!” answered\r\nHester Prynne, laying her finger on the red token.\r\n\r\n“Woman, it is thy badge of shame!” replied the stern magistrate. “It is\r\nbecause of the stain which that letter indicates that we would transfer\r\nthy child to other hands.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” said the mother, calmly, though growing more pale,\r\n“this badge hath taught me—it daily teaches me—it is teaching me at\r\nthis moment—lessons whereof my child may be the wiser and better,\r\nalbeit they can profit nothing to myself.”\r\n\r\n“We will judge warily,” said Bellingham, “and look well what we are\r\nabout to do. Good Master Wilson, I pray you, examine this Pearl—since\r\nthat is her name—and see whether she hath had such Christian nurture as\r\nbefits a child of her age.”\r\n\r\nThe old minister seated himself in an arm-chair and made an effort to\r\ndraw Pearl betwixt his knees. But the child, unaccustomed to the touch\r\nor familiarity of any but her mother, escaped through the open window,\r\nand stood on the upper step, looking like a wild tropical bird of rich\r\nplumage, ready to take flight into the upper air. Mr. Wilson, not a\r\nlittle astonished at this outbreak—for he was a grandfatherly sort of\r\npersonage, and usually a vast favourite with children—essayed, however,\r\nto proceed with the examination.\r\n\r\n“Pearl,” said he, with great solemnity, “thou must take heed to\r\ninstruction, that so, in due season, thou mayest wear in thy bosom the\r\npearl of great price. Canst thou tell me, my child, who made thee?”\r\n\r\nNow Pearl knew well enough who made her, for Hester Prynne, the\r\ndaughter of a pious home, very soon after her talk with the child about\r\nher Heavenly Father, had begun to inform her of those truths which the\r\nhuman spirit, at whatever stage of immaturity, imbibes with such eager\r\ninterest. Pearl, therefore—so large were the attainments of her three\r\nyears’ lifetime—could have borne a fair examination in the New England\r\nPrimer, or the first column of the Westminster Catechisms, although\r\nunacquainted with the outward form of either of those celebrated works.\r\nBut that perversity, which all children have more or less of, and of\r\nwhich little Pearl had a tenfold portion, now, at the most inopportune\r\nmoment, took thorough possession of her, and closed her lips, or\r\nimpelled her to speak words amiss. After putting her finger in her\r\nmouth, with many ungracious refusals to answer good Mr. Wilson’s\r\nquestion, the child finally announced that she had not been made at\r\nall, but had been plucked by her mother off the bush of wild roses that\r\ngrew by the prison-door.\r\n\r\nThis phantasy was probably suggested by the near proximity of the\r\nGovernor’s red roses, as Pearl stood outside of the window, together\r\nwith her recollection of the prison rose-bush, which she had passed in\r\ncoming hither.\r\n\r\nOld Roger Chillingworth, with a smile on his face, whispered something\r\nin the young clergyman’s ear. Hester Prynne looked at the man of skill,\r\nand even then, with her fate hanging in the balance, was startled to\r\nperceive what a change had come over his features—how much uglier they\r\nwere, how his dark complexion seemed to have grown duskier, and his\r\nfigure more misshapen—since the days when she had familiarly known him.\r\nShe met his eyes for an instant, but was immediately constrained to\r\ngive all her attention to the scene now going forward.\r\n\r\n“This is awful!” cried the Governor, slowly recovering from the\r\nastonishment into which Pearl’s response had thrown him. “Here is a\r\nchild of three years old, and she cannot tell who made her! Without\r\nquestion, she is equally in the dark as to her soul, its present\r\ndepravity, and future destiny! Methinks, gentlemen, we need inquire no\r\nfurther.”\r\n\r\nHester caught hold of Pearl, and drew her forcibly into her arms,\r\nconfronting the old Puritan magistrate with almost a fierce expression.\r\nAlone in the world, cast off by it, and with this sole treasure to keep\r\nher heart alive, she felt that she possessed indefeasible rights\r\nagainst the world, and was ready to defend them to the death.\r\n\r\n“God gave me the child!” cried she. “He gave her in requital of all\r\nthings else which ye had taken from me. She is my happiness—she is my\r\ntorture, none the less! Pearl keeps me here in life! Pearl punishes me,\r\ntoo! See ye not, she is the scarlet letter, only capable of being\r\nloved, and so endowed with a millionfold the power of retribution for\r\nmy sin? Ye shall not take her! I will die first!”\r\n\r\n“My poor woman,” said the not unkind old minister, “the child shall be\r\nwell cared for—far better than thou canst do for it.”\r\n\r\n“God gave her into my keeping!” repeated Hester Prynne, raising her\r\nvoice almost to a shriek. “I will not give her up!” And here by a\r\nsudden impulse, she turned to the young clergyman, Mr. Dimmesdale, at\r\nwhom, up to this moment, she had seemed hardly so much as once to\r\ndirect her eyes. “Speak thou for me!” cried she. “Thou wast my pastor,\r\nand hadst charge of my soul, and knowest me better than these men can.\r\nI will not lose the child! Speak for me! Thou knowest—for thou hast\r\nsympathies which these men lack—thou knowest what is in my heart, and\r\nwhat are a mother’s rights, and how much the stronger they are when\r\nthat mother has but her child and the scarlet letter! Look thou to it!\r\nI will not lose the child! Look to it!”\r\n\r\nAt this wild and singular appeal, which indicated that Hester Prynne’s\r\nsituation had provoked her to little less than madness, the young\r\nminister at once came forward, pale, and holding his hand over his\r\nheart, as was his custom whenever his peculiarly nervous temperament\r\nwas thrown into agitation. He looked now more careworn and emaciated\r\nthan as we described him at the scene of Hester’s public ignominy; and\r\nwhether it were his failing health, or whatever the cause might be, his\r\nlarge dark eyes had a world of pain in their troubled and melancholy\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\n“There is truth in what she says,” began the minister, with a voice\r\nsweet, tremulous, but powerful, insomuch that the hall re-echoed and\r\nthe hollow armour rang with it—“truth in what Hester says, and in the\r\nfeeling which inspires her! God gave her the child, and gave her, too,\r\nan instinctive knowledge of its nature and requirements—both seemingly\r\nso peculiar—which no other mortal being can possess. And, moreover, is\r\nthere not a quality of awful sacredness in the relation between this\r\nmother and this child?”\r\n\r\n“Ay—how is that, good Master Dimmesdale?” interrupted the Governor.\r\n“Make that plain, I pray you!”\r\n\r\n“It must be even so,” resumed the minister. “For, if we deem it\r\notherwise, do we not thereby say that the Heavenly Father, the creator\r\nof all flesh, hath lightly recognised a deed of sin, and made of no\r\naccount the distinction between unhallowed lust and holy love? This\r\nchild of its father’s guilt and its mother’s shame has come from the\r\nhand of God, to work in many ways upon her heart, who pleads so\r\nearnestly and with such bitterness of spirit the right to keep her. It\r\nwas meant for a blessing—for the one blessing of her life! It was\r\nmeant, doubtless, the mother herself hath told us, for a retribution,\r\ntoo; a torture to be felt at many an unthought-of moment; a pang, a\r\nsting, an ever-recurring agony, in the midst of a troubled joy! Hath\r\nshe not expressed this thought in the garb of the poor child, so\r\nforcibly reminding us of that red symbol which sears her bosom?”\r\n\r\n“Well said again!” cried good Mr. Wilson. “I feared the woman had no\r\nbetter thought than to make a mountebank of her child!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, not so!—not so!” continued Mr. Dimmesdale. “She recognises,\r\nbelieve me, the solemn miracle which God hath wrought in the existence\r\nof that child. And may she feel, too—what, methinks, is the very\r\ntruth—that this boon was meant, above all things else, to keep the\r\nmother’s soul alive, and to preserve her from blacker depths of sin\r\ninto which Satan might else have sought to plunge her! Therefore it is\r\ngood for this poor, sinful woman, that she hath an infant immortality,\r\na being capable of eternal joy or sorrow, confided to her care—to be\r\ntrained up by her to righteousness, to remind her, at every moment, of\r\nher fall, but yet to teach her, as if it were by the Creator’s sacred\r\npledge, that, if she bring the child to heaven, the child also will\r\nbring its parents thither! Herein is the sinful mother happier than the\r\nsinful father. For Hester Prynne’s sake, then, and no less for the poor\r\nchild’s sake, let us leave them as Providence hath seen fit to place\r\nthem!”\r\n\r\n“You speak, my friend, with a strange earnestness,” said old Roger\r\nChillingworth, smiling at him.\r\n\r\n“And there is a weighty import in what my young brother hath spoken,”\r\nadded the Rev. Mr. Wilson.\r\n\r\n“What say you, worshipful Master Bellingham? Hath he not pleaded well\r\nfor the poor woman?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed hath he,” answered the magistrate; “and hath adduced such\r\narguments, that we will even leave the matter as it now stands; so\r\nlong, at least, as there shall be no further scandal in the woman. Care\r\nmust be had nevertheless, to put the child to due and stated\r\nexamination in the catechism, at thy hands or Master Dimmesdale’s.\r\nMoreover, at a proper season, the tithing-men must take heed that she\r\ngo both to school and to meeting.”\r\n\r\nThe young minister, on ceasing to speak had withdrawn a few steps from\r\nthe group, and stood with his face partially concealed in the heavy\r\nfolds of the window-curtain; while the shadow of his figure, which the\r\nsunlight cast upon the floor, was tremulous with the vehemence of his\r\nappeal. Pearl, that wild and flighty little elf stole softly towards\r\nhim, and taking his hand in the grasp of both her own, laid her cheek\r\nagainst it; a caress so tender, and withal so unobtrusive, that her\r\nmother, who was looking on, asked herself—“Is that my Pearl?” Yet she\r\nknew that there was love in the child’s heart, although it mostly\r\nrevealed itself in passion, and hardly twice in her lifetime had been\r\nsoftened by such gentleness as now. The minister—for, save the\r\nlong-sought regards of woman, nothing is sweeter than these marks of\r\nchildish preference, accorded spontaneously by a spiritual instinct,\r\nand therefore seeming to imply in us something truly worthy to be\r\nloved—the minister looked round, laid his hand on the child’s head,\r\nhesitated an instant, and then kissed her brow. Little Pearl’s unwonted\r\nmood of sentiment lasted no longer; she laughed, and went capering down\r\nthe hall so airily, that old Mr. Wilson raised a question whether even\r\nher tiptoes touched the floor.\r\n\r\n“The little baggage hath witchcraft in her, I profess,” said he to Mr.\r\nDimmesdale. “She needs no old woman’s broomstick to fly withal!”\r\n\r\n“A strange child!” remarked old Roger Chillingworth. “It is easy to see\r\nthe mother’s part in her. Would it be beyond a philosopher’s research,\r\nthink ye, gentlemen, to analyse that child’s nature, and, from it make\r\na mould, to give a shrewd guess at the father?”\r\n\r\n“Nay; it would be sinful, in such a question, to follow the clue of\r\nprofane philosophy,” said Mr. Wilson. “Better to fast and pray upon it;\r\nand still better, it may be, to leave the mystery as we find it, unless\r\nProvidence reveal it of its own accord. Thereby, every good Christian\r\nman hath a title to show a father’s kindness towards the poor, deserted\r\nbabe.”\r\n\r\nThe affair being so satisfactorily concluded, Hester Prynne, with\r\nPearl, departed from the house. As they descended the steps, it is\r\naverred that the lattice of a chamber-window was thrown open, and forth\r\ninto the sunny day was thrust the face of Mistress Hibbins, Governor\r\nBellingham’s bitter-tempered sister, and the same who, a few years\r\nlater, was executed as a witch.\r\n\r\n“Hist, hist!” said she, while her ill-omened physiognomy seemed to cast\r\na shadow over the cheerful newness of the house. “Wilt thou go with us\r\ntonight? There will be a merry company in the forest; and I well-nigh\r\npromised the Black Man that comely Hester Prynne should make one.”\r\n\r\n“Make my excuse to him, so please you!” answered Hester, with a\r\ntriumphant smile. “I must tarry at home, and keep watch over my little\r\nPearl. Had they taken her from me, I would willingly have gone with\r\nthee into the forest, and signed my name in the Black Man’s book too,\r\nand that with mine own blood!”\r\n\r\n“We shall have thee there anon!” said the witch-lady, frowning, as she\r\ndrew back her head.\r\n\r\nBut here—if we suppose this interview betwixt Mistress Hibbins and\r\nHester Prynne to be authentic, and not a parable—was already an\r\nillustration of the young minister’s argument against sundering the\r\nrelation of a fallen mother to the offspring of her frailty. Even thus\r\nearly had the child saved her from Satan’s snare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\nTHE LEECH\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the appellation of Roger Chillingworth, the reader will remember,\r\nwas hidden another name, which its former wearer had resolved should\r\nnever more be spoken. It has been related, how, in the crowd that\r\nwitnessed Hester Prynne’s ignominious exposure, stood a man, elderly,\r\ntravel-worn, who, just emerging from the perilous wilderness, beheld\r\nthe woman, in whom he hoped to find embodied the warmth and\r\ncheerfulness of home, set up as a type of sin before the people. Her\r\nmatronly fame was trodden under all men’s feet. Infamy was babbling\r\naround her in the public market-place. For her kindred, should the\r\ntidings ever reach them, and for the companions of her unspotted life,\r\nthere remained nothing but the contagion of her dishonour; which would\r\nnot fail to be distributed in strict accordance and proportion with the\r\nintimacy and sacredness of their previous relationship. Then why—since\r\nthe choice was with himself—should the individual, whose connexion with\r\nthe fallen woman had been the most intimate and sacred of them all,\r\ncome forward to vindicate his claim to an inheritance so little\r\ndesirable? He resolved not to be pilloried beside her on her pedestal\r\nof shame. Unknown to all but Hester Prynne, and possessing the lock and\r\nkey of her silence, he chose to withdraw his name from the roll of\r\nmankind, and, as regarded his former ties and interest, to vanish out\r\nof life as completely as if he indeed lay at the bottom of the ocean,\r\nwhither rumour had long ago consigned him. This purpose once effected,\r\nnew interests would immediately spring up, and likewise a new purpose;\r\ndark, it is true, if not guilty, but of force enough to engage the full\r\nstrength of his faculties.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this resolve, he took up his residence in the Puritan\r\ntown as Roger Chillingworth, without other introduction than the\r\nlearning and intelligence of which he possessed more than a common\r\nmeasure. As his studies, at a previous period of his life, had made him\r\nextensively acquainted with the medical science of the day, it was as a\r\nphysician that he presented himself and as such was cordially received.\r\nSkilful men, of the medical and chirurgical profession, were of rare\r\noccurrence in the colony. They seldom, it would appear, partook of the\r\nreligious zeal that brought other emigrants across the Atlantic. In\r\ntheir researches into the human frame, it may be that the higher and\r\nmore subtle faculties of such men were materialised, and that they lost\r\nthe spiritual view of existence amid the intricacies of that wondrous\r\nmechanism, which seemed to involve art enough to comprise all of life\r\nwithin itself. At all events, the health of the good town of Boston, so\r\nfar as medicine had aught to do with it, had hitherto lain in the\r\nguardianship of an aged deacon and apothecary, whose piety and godly\r\ndeportment were stronger testimonials in his favour than any that he\r\ncould have produced in the shape of a diploma. The only surgeon was one\r\nwho combined the occasional exercise of that noble art with the daily\r\nand habitual flourish of a razor. To such a professional body Roger\r\nChillingworth was a brilliant acquisition. He soon manifested his\r\nfamiliarity with the ponderous and imposing machinery of antique\r\nphysic; in which every remedy contained a multitude of far-fetched and\r\nheterogeneous ingredients, as elaborately compounded as if the proposed\r\nresult had been the Elixir of Life. In his Indian captivity, moreover,\r\nhe had gained much knowledge of the properties of native herbs and\r\nroots; nor did he conceal from his patients that these simple\r\nmedicines, Nature’s boon to the untutored savage, had quite as large a\r\nshare of his own confidence as the European Pharmacopœia, which so\r\nmany learned doctors had spent centuries in elaborating.\r\n\r\nThis learned stranger was exemplary as regarded at least the outward\r\nforms of a religious life; and early after his arrival, had chosen for\r\nhis spiritual guide the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. The young divine,\r\nwhose scholar-like renown still lived in Oxford, was considered by his\r\nmore fervent admirers as little less than a heavenly ordained apostle,\r\ndestined, should he live and labour for the ordinary term of life, to\r\ndo as great deeds, for the now feeble New England Church, as the early\r\nFathers had achieved for the infancy of the Christian faith. About this\r\nperiod, however, the health of Mr. Dimmesdale had evidently begun to\r\nfail. By those best acquainted with his habits, the paleness of the\r\nyoung minister’s cheek was accounted for by his too earnest devotion to\r\nstudy, his scrupulous fulfilment of parochial duty, and more than all,\r\nto the fasts and vigils of which he made a frequent practice, in order\r\nto keep the grossness of this earthly state from clogging and obscuring\r\nhis spiritual lamp. Some declared, that if Mr. Dimmesdale were really\r\ngoing to die, it was cause enough that the world was not worthy to be\r\nany longer trodden by his feet. He himself, on the other hand, with\r\ncharacteristic humility, avowed his belief that if Providence should\r\nsee fit to remove him, it would be because of his own unworthiness to\r\nperform its humblest mission here on earth. With all this difference of\r\nopinion as to the cause of his decline, there could be no question of\r\nthe fact. His form grew emaciated; his voice, though still rich and\r\nsweet, had a certain melancholy prophecy of decay in it; he was often\r\nobserved, on any slight alarm or other sudden accident, to put his hand\r\nover his heart with first a flush and then a paleness, indicative of\r\npain.\r\n\r\nSuch was the young clergyman’s condition, and so imminent the prospect\r\nthat his dawning light would be extinguished, all untimely, when Roger\r\nChillingworth made his advent to the town. His first entry on the\r\nscene, few people could tell whence, dropping down as it were out of\r\nthe sky or starting from the nether earth, had an aspect of mystery,\r\nwhich was easily heightened to the miraculous. He was now known to be a\r\nman of skill; it was observed that he gathered herbs and the blossoms\r\nof wild-flowers, and dug up roots and plucked off twigs from the\r\nforest-trees like one acquainted with hidden virtues in what was\r\nvalueless to common eyes. He was heard to speak of Sir Kenelm Digby and\r\nother famous men—whose scientific attainments were esteemed hardly less\r\nthan supernatural—as having been his correspondents or associates. Why,\r\nwith such rank in the learned world, had he come hither? What, could\r\nhe, whose sphere was in great cities, be seeking in the wilderness? In\r\nanswer to this query, a rumour gained ground—and however absurd, was\r\nentertained by some very sensible people—that Heaven had wrought an\r\nabsolute miracle, by transporting an eminent Doctor of Physic from a\r\nGerman university bodily through the air and setting him down at the\r\ndoor of Mr. Dimmesdale’s study! Individuals of wiser faith, indeed, who\r\nknew that Heaven promotes its purposes without aiming at the\r\nstage-effect of what is called miraculous interposition, were inclined\r\nto see a providential hand in Roger Chillingworth’s so opportune\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nThis idea was countenanced by the strong interest which the physician\r\never manifested in the young clergyman; he attached himself to him as a\r\nparishioner, and sought to win a friendly regard and confidence from\r\nhis naturally reserved sensibility. He expressed great alarm at his\r\npastor’s state of health, but was anxious to attempt the cure, and, if\r\nearly undertaken, seemed not despondent of a favourable result. The\r\nelders, the deacons, the motherly dames, and the young and fair maidens\r\nof Mr. Dimmesdale’s flock, were alike importunate that he should make\r\ntrial of the physician’s frankly offered skill. Mr. Dimmesdale gently\r\nrepelled their entreaties.\r\n\r\n“I need no medicine,” said he.\r\n\r\nBut how could the young minister say so, when, with every successive\r\nSabbath, his cheek was paler and thinner, and his voice more tremulous\r\nthan before—when it had now become a constant habit, rather than a\r\ncasual gesture, to press his hand over his heart? Was he weary of his\r\nlabours? Did he wish to die? These questions were solemnly propounded\r\nto Mr. Dimmesdale by the elder ministers of Boston, and the deacons of\r\nhis church, who, to use their own phrase, “dealt with him,” on the sin\r\nof rejecting the aid which Providence so manifestly held out. He\r\nlistened in silence, and finally promised to confer with the physician.\r\n\r\n“Were it God’s will,” said the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, when, in\r\nfulfilment of this pledge, he requested old Roger Chillingworth’s\r\nprofessional advice, “I could be well content that my labours, and my\r\nsorrows, and my sins, and my pains, should shortly end with me, and\r\nwhat is earthly of them be buried in my grave, and the spiritual go\r\nwith me to my eternal state, rather than that you should put your skill\r\nto the proof in my behalf.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” replied Roger Chillingworth, with that quietness, which, whether\r\nimposed or natural, marked all his deportment, “it is thus that a young\r\nclergyman is apt to speak. Youthful men, not having taken a deep root,\r\ngive up their hold of life so easily! And saintly men, who walk with\r\nGod on earth, would fain be away, to walk with him on the golden\r\npavements of the New Jerusalem.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” rejoined the young minister, putting his hand to his heart, with\r\na flush of pain flitting over his brow, “were I worthier to walk there,\r\nI could be better content to toil here.”\r\n\r\n“Good men ever interpret themselves too meanly,” said the physician.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, the mysterious old Roger Chillingworth became the\r\nmedical adviser of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. As not only the disease\r\ninterested the physician, but he was strongly moved to look into the\r\ncharacter and qualities of the patient, these two men, so different in\r\nage, came gradually to spend much time together. For the sake of the\r\nminister’s health, and to enable the leech to gather plants with\r\nhealing balm in them, they took long walks on the sea-shore, or in the\r\nforest; mingling various walks with the splash and murmur of the waves,\r\nand the solemn wind-anthem among the tree-tops. Often, likewise, one\r\nwas the guest of the other in his place of study and retirement. There\r\nwas a fascination for the minister in the company of the man of\r\nscience, in whom he recognised an intellectual cultivation of no\r\nmoderate depth or scope; together with a range and freedom of ideas,\r\nthat he would have vainly looked for among the members of his own\r\nprofession. In truth, he was startled, if not shocked, to find this\r\nattribute in the physician. Mr. Dimmesdale was a true priest, a true\r\nreligionist, with the reverential sentiment largely developed, and an\r\norder of mind that impelled itself powerfully along the track of a\r\ncreed, and wore its passage continually deeper with the lapse of time.\r\nIn no state of society would he have been what is called a man of\r\nliberal views; it would always be essential to his peace to feel the\r\npressure of a faith about him, supporting, while it confined him within\r\nits iron framework. Not the less, however, though with a tremulous\r\nenjoyment, did he feel the occasional relief of looking at the universe\r\nthrough the medium of another kind of intellect than those with which\r\nhe habitually held converse. It was as if a window were thrown open,\r\nadmitting a freer atmosphere into the close and stifled study, where\r\nhis life was wasting itself away, amid lamp-light, or obstructed\r\nday-beams, and the musty fragrance, be it sensual or moral, that\r\nexhales from books. But the air was too fresh and chill to be long\r\nbreathed with comfort. So the minister, and the physician with him,\r\nwithdrew again within the limits of what their Church defined as\r\northodox.\r\n\r\nThus Roger Chillingworth scrutinised his patient carefully, both as he\r\nsaw him in his ordinary life, keeping an accustomed pathway in the\r\nrange of thoughts familiar to him, and as he appeared when thrown\r\namidst other moral scenery, the novelty of which might call out\r\nsomething new to the surface of his character. He deemed it essential,\r\nit would seem, to know the man, before attempting to do him good.\r\nWherever there is a heart and an intellect, the diseases of the\r\nphysical frame are tinged with the peculiarities of these. In Arthur\r\nDimmesdale, thought and imagination were so active, and sensibility so\r\nintense, that the bodily infirmity would be likely to have its\r\ngroundwork there. So Roger Chillingworth—the man of skill, the kind and\r\nfriendly physician—strove to go deep into his patient’s bosom, delving\r\namong his principles, prying into his recollections, and probing\r\neverything with a cautious touch, like a treasure-seeker in a dark\r\ncavern. Few secrets can escape an investigator, who has opportunity and\r\nlicence to undertake such a quest, and skill to follow it up. A man\r\nburdened with a secret should especially avoid the intimacy of his\r\nphysician. If the latter possess native sagacity, and a nameless\r\nsomething more,—let us call it intuition; if he show no intrusive\r\negotism, nor disagreeable prominent characteristics of his own; if he\r\nhave the power, which must be born with him, to bring his mind into\r\nsuch affinity with his patient’s, that this last shall unawares have\r\nspoken what he imagines himself only to have thought; if such\r\nrevelations be received without tumult, and acknowledged not so often\r\nby an uttered sympathy as by silence, an inarticulate breath, and here\r\nand there a word to indicate that all is understood; if to these\r\nqualifications of a confidant be joined the advantages afforded by his\r\nrecognised character as a physician;—then, at some inevitable moment,\r\nwill the soul of the sufferer be dissolved, and flow forth in a dark\r\nbut transparent stream, bringing all its mysteries into the daylight.\r\n\r\nRoger Chillingworth possessed all, or most, of the attributes above\r\nenumerated. Nevertheless, time went on; a kind of intimacy, as we have\r\nsaid, grew up between these two cultivated minds, which had as wide a\r\nfield as the whole sphere of human thought and study to meet upon; they\r\ndiscussed every topic of ethics and religion, of public affairs, and\r\nprivate character; they talked much, on both sides, of matters that\r\nseemed personal to themselves; and yet no secret, such as the physician\r\nfancied must exist there, ever stole out of the minister’s\r\nconsciousness into his companion’s ear. The latter had his suspicions,\r\nindeed, that even the nature of Mr. Dimmesdale’s bodily disease had\r\nnever fairly been revealed to him. It was a strange reserve!\r\n\r\nAfter a time, at a hint from Roger Chillingworth, the friends of Mr.\r\nDimmesdale effected an arrangement by which the two were lodged in the\r\nsame house; so that every ebb and flow of the minister’s life-tide\r\nmight pass under the eye of his anxious and attached physician. There\r\nwas much joy throughout the town when this greatly desirable object was\r\nattained. It was held to be the best possible measure for the young\r\nclergyman’s welfare; unless, indeed, as often urged by such as felt\r\nauthorised to do so, he had selected some one of the many blooming\r\ndamsels, spiritually devoted to him, to become his devoted wife. This\r\nlatter step, however, there was no present prospect that Arthur\r\nDimmesdale would be prevailed upon to take; he rejected all suggestions\r\nof the kind, as if priestly celibacy were one of his articles of Church\r\ndiscipline. Doomed by his own choice, therefore, as Mr. Dimmesdale so\r\nevidently was, to eat his unsavoury morsel always at another’s board,\r\nand endure the life-long chill which must be his lot who seeks to warm\r\nhimself only at another’s fireside, it truly seemed that this\r\nsagacious, experienced, benevolent old physician, with his concord of\r\npaternal and reverential love for the young pastor, was the very man,\r\nof all mankind, to be constantly within reach of his voice.\r\n\r\nThe new abode of the two friends was with a pious widow, of good social\r\nrank, who dwelt in a house covering pretty nearly the site on which the\r\nvenerable structure of King’s Chapel has since been built. It had the\r\ngraveyard, originally Isaac Johnson’s home-field, on one side, and so\r\nwas well adapted to call up serious reflections, suited to their\r\nrespective employments, in both minister and man of physic. The\r\nmotherly care of the good widow assigned to Mr. Dimmesdale a front\r\napartment, with a sunny exposure, and heavy window-curtains, to create\r\na noontide shadow when desirable. The walls were hung round with\r\ntapestry, said to be from the Gobelin looms, and, at all events,\r\nrepresenting the Scriptural story of David and Bathsheba, and Nathan\r\nthe Prophet, in colours still unfaded, but which made the fair woman of\r\nthe scene almost as grimly picturesque as the woe-denouncing seer. Here\r\nthe pale clergyman piled up his library, rich with parchment-bound\r\nfolios of the Fathers, and the lore of Rabbis, and monkish erudition,\r\nof which the Protestant divines, even while they vilified and decried\r\nthat class of writers, were yet constrained often to avail themselves.\r\nOn the other side of the house, old Roger Chillingworth arranged his\r\nstudy and laboratory: not such as a modern man of science would reckon\r\neven tolerably complete, but provided with a distilling apparatus and\r\nthe means of compounding drugs and chemicals, which the practised\r\nalchemist knew well how to turn to purpose. With such commodiousness of\r\nsituation, these two learned persons sat themselves down, each in his\r\nown domain, yet familiarly passing from one apartment to the other, and\r\nbestowing a mutual and not incurious inspection into one another’s\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nAnd the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale’s best discerning friends, as we\r\nhave intimated, very reasonably imagined that the hand of Providence\r\nhad done all this for the purpose—besought in so many public and\r\ndomestic and secret prayers—of restoring the young minister to health.\r\nBut, it must now be said, another portion of the community had latterly\r\nbegun to take its own view of the relation betwixt Mr. Dimmesdale and\r\nthe mysterious old physician. When an uninstructed multitude attempts\r\nto see with its eyes, it is exceedingly apt to be deceived. When,\r\nhowever, it forms its judgment, as it usually does, on the intuitions\r\nof its great and warm heart, the conclusions thus attained are often so\r\nprofound and so unerring as to possess the character of truth\r\nsupernaturally revealed. The people, in the case of which we speak,\r\ncould justify its prejudice against Roger Chillingworth by no fact or\r\nargument worthy of serious refutation. There was an aged\r\nhandicraftsman, it is true, who had been a citizen of London at the\r\nperiod of Sir Thomas Overbury’s murder, now some thirty years agone; he\r\ntestified to having seen the physician, under some other name, which\r\nthe narrator of the story had now forgotten, in company with Dr.\r\nForman, the famous old conjurer, who was implicated in the affair of\r\nOverbury. Two or three individuals hinted that the man of skill, during\r\nhis Indian captivity, had enlarged his medical attainments by joining\r\nin the incantations of the savage priests, who were universally\r\nacknowledged to be powerful enchanters, often performing seemingly\r\nmiraculous cures by their skill in the black art. A large number—and\r\nmany of these were persons of such sober sense and practical\r\nobservation that their opinions would have been valuable in other\r\nmatters—affirmed that Roger Chillingworth’s aspect had undergone a\r\nremarkable change while he had dwelt in town, and especially since his\r\nabode with Mr. Dimmesdale. At first, his expression had been calm,\r\nmeditative, scholar-like. Now there was something ugly and evil in his\r\nface, which they had not previously noticed, and which grew still the\r\nmore obvious to sight the oftener they looked upon him. According to\r\nthe vulgar idea, the fire in his laboratory had been brought from the\r\nlower regions, and was fed with infernal fuel; and so, as might be\r\nexpected, his visage was getting sooty with the smoke.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the matter, it grew to be a widely diffused opinion that the\r\nRev. Arthur Dimmesdale, like many other personages of special sanctity,\r\nin all ages of the Christian world, was haunted either by Satan himself\r\nor Satan’s emissary, in the guise of old Roger Chillingworth. This\r\ndiabolical agent had the Divine permission, for a season, to burrow\r\ninto the clergyman’s intimacy, and plot against his soul. No sensible\r\nman, it was confessed, could doubt on which side the victory would\r\nturn. The people looked, with an unshaken hope, to see the minister\r\ncome forth out of the conflict transfigured with the glory which he\r\nwould unquestionably win. Meanwhile, nevertheless, it was sad to think\r\nof the perchance mortal agony through which he must struggle towards\r\nhis triumph.\r\n\r\nAlas! to judge from the gloom and terror in the depth of the poor\r\nminister’s eyes, the battle was a sore one, and the victory anything\r\nbut secure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\nTHE LEECH AND HIS PATIENT\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Roger Chillingworth, throughout life, had been calm in temperament,\r\nkindly, though not of warm affections, but ever, and in all his\r\nrelations with the world, a pure and upright man. He had begun an\r\ninvestigation, as he imagined, with the severe and equal integrity of a\r\njudge, desirous only of truth, even as if the question involved no more\r\nthan the air-drawn lines and figures of a geometrical problem, instead\r\nof human passions, and wrongs inflicted on himself. But, as he\r\nproceeded, a terrible fascination, a kind of fierce, though still calm,\r\nnecessity, seized the old man within its gripe, and never set him free\r\nagain until he had done all its bidding. He now dug into the poor\r\nclergyman’s heart, like a miner searching for gold; or, rather, like a\r\nsexton delving into a grave, possibly in quest of a jewel that had been\r\nburied on the dead man’s bosom, but likely to find nothing save\r\nmortality and corruption. Alas, for his own soul, if these were what he\r\nsought!\r\n\r\nSometimes a light glimmered out of the physician’s eyes, burning blue\r\nand ominous, like the reflection of a furnace, or, let us say, like one\r\nof those gleams of ghastly fire that darted from Bunyan’s awful doorway\r\nin the hillside, and quivered on the pilgrim’s face. The soil where\r\nthis dark miner was working had perchance shown indications that\r\nencouraged him.\r\n\r\n“This man,” said he, at one such moment, to himself, “pure as they deem\r\nhim—all spiritual as he seems—hath inherited a strong animal nature\r\nfrom his father or his mother. Let us dig a little further in the\r\ndirection of this vein!”\r\n\r\nThen after long search into the minister’s dim interior, and turning\r\nover many precious materials, in the shape of high aspirations for the\r\nwelfare of his race, warm love of souls, pure sentiments, natural\r\npiety, strengthened by thought and study, and illuminated by\r\nrevelation—all of which invaluable gold was perhaps no better than\r\nrubbish to the seeker—he would turn back, discouraged, and begin his\r\nquest towards another point. He groped along as stealthily, with as\r\ncautious a tread, and as wary an outlook, as a thief entering a chamber\r\nwhere a man lies only half asleep—or, it may be, broad awake—with\r\npurpose to steal the very treasure which this man guards as the apple\r\nof his eye. In spite of his premeditated carefulness, the floor would\r\nnow and then creak; his garments would rustle; the shadow of his\r\npresence, in a forbidden proximity, would be thrown across his victim.\r\nIn other words, Mr. Dimmesdale, whose sensibility of nerve often\r\nproduced the effect of spiritual intuition, would become vaguely aware\r\nthat something inimical to his peace had thrust itself into relation\r\nwith him. But Old Roger Chillingworth, too, had perceptions that were\r\nalmost intuitive; and when the minister threw his startled eyes towards\r\nhim, there the physician sat; his kind, watchful, sympathising, but\r\nnever intrusive friend.\r\n\r\nYet Mr. Dimmesdale would perhaps have seen this individual’s character\r\nmore perfectly, if a certain morbidness, to which sick hearts are\r\nliable, had not rendered him suspicious of all mankind. Trusting no man\r\nas his friend, he could not recognize his enemy when the latter\r\nactually appeared. He therefore still kept up a familiar intercourse\r\nwith him, daily receiving the old physician in his study, or visiting\r\nthe laboratory, and, for recreation’s sake, watching the processes by\r\nwhich weeds were converted into drugs of potency.\r\n\r\nOne day, leaning his forehead on his hand, and his elbow on the sill of\r\nthe open window, that looked towards the graveyard, he talked with\r\nRoger Chillingworth, while the old man was examining a bundle of\r\nunsightly plants.\r\n\r\n“Where,” asked he, with a look askance at them—for it was the\r\nclergyman’s peculiarity that he seldom, now-a-days, looked straight\r\nforth at any object, whether human or inanimate, “where, my kind\r\ndoctor, did you gather those herbs, with such a dark, flabby leaf?”\r\n\r\n“Even in the graveyard here at hand,” answered the physician,\r\ncontinuing his employment. “They are new to me. I found them growing on\r\na grave, which bore no tombstone, no other memorial of the dead man,\r\nsave these ugly weeds, that have taken upon themselves to keep him in\r\nremembrance. They grew out of his heart, and typify, it may be, some\r\nhideous secret that was buried with him, and which he had done better\r\nto confess during his lifetime.”\r\n\r\n“Perchance,” said Mr. Dimmesdale, “he earnestly desired it, but could\r\nnot.”\r\n\r\n“And wherefore?” rejoined the physician.\r\n\r\n“Wherefore not; since all the powers of nature call so earnestly for\r\nthe confession of sin, that these black weeds have sprung up out of a\r\nburied heart, to make manifest, an outspoken crime?”\r\n\r\n“That, good sir, is but a phantasy of yours,” replied the minister.\r\n“There can be, if I forbode aright, no power, short of the Divine\r\nmercy, to disclose, whether by uttered words, or by type or emblem, the\r\nsecrets that may be buried in the human heart. The heart, making itself\r\nguilty of such secrets, must perforce hold them, until the day when all\r\nhidden things shall be revealed. Nor have I so read or interpreted Holy\r\nWrit, as to understand that the disclosure of human thoughts and deeds,\r\nthen to be made, is intended as a part of the retribution. That,\r\nsurely, were a shallow view of it. No; these revelations, unless I\r\ngreatly err, are meant merely to promote the intellectual satisfaction\r\nof all intelligent beings, who will stand waiting, on that day, to see\r\nthe dark problem of this life made plain. A knowledge of men’s hearts\r\nwill be needful to the completest solution of that problem. And, I\r\nconceive moreover, that the hearts holding such miserable secrets as\r\nyou speak of, will yield them up, at that last day, not with\r\nreluctance, but with a joy unutterable.”\r\n\r\n“Then why not reveal it here?” asked Roger Chillingworth, glancing\r\nquietly aside at the minister. “Why should not the guilty ones sooner\r\navail themselves of this unutterable solace?”\r\n\r\n“They mostly do,” said the clergyman, griping hard at his breast, as if\r\nafflicted with an importunate throb of pain. “Many, many a poor soul\r\nhath given its confidence to me, not only on the death-bed, but while\r\nstrong in life, and fair in reputation. And ever, after such an\r\noutpouring, oh, what a relief have I witnessed in those sinful\r\nbrethren! even as in one who at last draws free air, after a long\r\nstifling with his own polluted breath. How can it be otherwise? Why\r\nshould a wretched man—guilty, we will say, of murder—prefer to keep the\r\ndead corpse buried in his own heart, rather than fling it forth at\r\nonce, and let the universe take care of it!”\r\n\r\n“Yet some men bury their secrets thus,” observed the calm physician.\r\n\r\n“True; there are such men,” answered Mr. Dimmesdale. “But not to\r\nsuggest more obvious reasons, it may be that they are kept silent by\r\nthe very constitution of their nature. Or—can we not suppose it?—guilty\r\nas they may be, retaining, nevertheless, a zeal for God’s glory and\r\nman’s welfare, they shrink from displaying themselves black and filthy\r\nin the view of men; because, thenceforward, no good can be achieved by\r\nthem; no evil of the past be redeemed by better service. So, to their\r\nown unutterable torment, they go about among their fellow-creatures,\r\nlooking pure as new-fallen snow, while their hearts are all speckled\r\nand spotted with iniquity of which they cannot rid themselves.”\r\n\r\n“These men deceive themselves,” said Roger Chillingworth, with somewhat\r\nmore emphasis than usual, and making a slight gesture with his\r\nforefinger. “They fear to take up the shame that rightfully belongs to\r\nthem. Their love for man, their zeal for God’s service—these holy\r\nimpulses may or may not coexist in their hearts with the evil inmates\r\nto which their guilt has unbarred the door, and which must needs\r\npropagate a hellish breed within them. But, if they seek to glorify\r\nGod, let them not lift heavenward their unclean hands! If they would\r\nserve their fellowmen, let them do it by making manifest the power and\r\nreality of conscience, in constraining them to penitential\r\nself-abasement! Would thou have me to believe, O wise and pious friend,\r\nthat a false show can be better—can be more for God’s glory, or man’s\r\nwelfare—than God’s own truth? Trust me, such men deceive themselves!”\r\n\r\n“It may be so,” said the young clergyman, indifferently, as waiving a\r\ndiscussion that he considered irrelevant or unseasonable. He had a\r\nready faculty, indeed, of escaping from any topic that agitated his too\r\nsensitive and nervous temperament.—“But, now, I would ask of my\r\nwell-skilled physician, whether, in good sooth, he deems me to have\r\nprofited by his kindly care of this weak frame of mine?”\r\n\r\nBefore Roger Chillingworth could answer, they heard the clear, wild\r\nlaughter of a young child’s voice, proceeding from the adjacent\r\nburial-ground. Looking instinctively from the open window—for it was\r\nsummer-time—the minister beheld Hester Prynne and little Pearl passing\r\nalong the footpath that traversed the enclosure. Pearl looked as\r\nbeautiful as the day, but was in one of those moods of perverse\r\nmerriment which, whenever they occurred, seemed to remove her entirely\r\nout of the sphere of sympathy or human contact. She now skipped\r\nirreverently from one grave to another; until coming to the broad,\r\nflat, armorial tombstone of a departed worthy—perhaps of Isaac Johnson\r\nhimself—she began to dance upon it. In reply to her mother’s command\r\nand entreaty that she would behave more decorously, little Pearl paused\r\nto gather the prickly burrs from a tall burdock which grew beside the\r\ntomb. Taking a handful of these, she arranged them along the lines of\r\nthe scarlet letter that decorated the maternal bosom, to which the\r\nburrs, as their nature was, tenaciously adhered. Hester did not pluck\r\nthem off.\r\n\r\nRoger Chillingworth had by this time approached the window and smiled\r\ngrimly down.\r\n\r\n“There is no law, nor reverence for authority, no regard for human\r\nordinances or opinions, right or wrong, mixed up with that child’s\r\ncomposition,” remarked he, as much to himself as to his companion. “I\r\nsaw her, the other day, bespatter the Governor himself with water at\r\nthe cattle-trough in Spring Lane. What, in heaven’s name, is she? Is\r\nthe imp altogether evil? Hath she affections? Hath she any discoverable\r\nprinciple of being?”\r\n\r\n“None, save the freedom of a broken law,” answered Mr. Dimmesdale, in a\r\nquiet way, as if he had been discussing the point within himself,\r\n“Whether capable of good, I know not.”\r\n\r\nThe child probably overheard their voices, for, looking up to the\r\nwindow with a bright, but naughty smile of mirth and intelligence, she\r\nthrew one of the prickly burrs at the Rev. Mr. Dimmesdale. The\r\nsensitive clergyman shrank, with nervous dread, from the light missile.\r\nDetecting his emotion, Pearl clapped her little hands in the most\r\nextravagant ecstacy. Hester Prynne, likewise, had involuntarily looked\r\nup, and all these four persons, old and young, regarded one another in\r\nsilence, till the child laughed aloud, and shouted—“Come away, mother!\r\nCome away, or yonder old black man will catch you! He hath got hold of\r\nthe minister already. Come away, mother or he will catch you! But he\r\ncannot catch little Pearl!”\r\n\r\nSo she drew her mother away, skipping, dancing, and frisking\r\nfantastically among the hillocks of the dead people, like a creature\r\nthat had nothing in common with a bygone and buried generation, nor\r\nowned herself akin to it. It was as if she had been made afresh out of\r\nnew elements, and must perforce be permitted to live her own life, and\r\nbe a law unto herself without her eccentricities being reckoned to her\r\nfor a crime.\r\n\r\n“There goes a woman,” resumed Roger Chillingworth, after a pause, “who,\r\nbe her demerits what they may, hath none of that mystery of hidden\r\nsinfulness which you deem so grievous to be borne. Is Hester Prynne the\r\nless miserable, think you, for that scarlet letter on her breast?”\r\n\r\n“I do verily believe it,” answered the clergyman. “Nevertheless, I\r\ncannot answer for her. There was a look of pain in her face which I\r\nwould gladly have been spared the sight of. But still, methinks, it\r\nmust needs be better for the sufferer to be free to show his pain, as\r\nthis poor woman Hester is, than to cover it up in his heart.”\r\n\r\nThere was another pause, and the physician began anew to examine and\r\narrange the plants which he had gathered.\r\n\r\n“You inquired of me, a little time agone,” said he, at length, “my\r\njudgment as touching your health.”\r\n\r\n“I did,” answered the clergyman, “and would gladly learn it. Speak\r\nfrankly, I pray you, be it for life or death.”\r\n\r\n“Freely then, and plainly,” said the physician, still busy with his\r\nplants, but keeping a wary eye on Mr. Dimmesdale, “the disorder is a\r\nstrange one; not so much in itself nor as outwardly manifested,—in so\r\nfar, at least as the symptoms have been laid open to my observation.\r\nLooking daily at you, my good sir, and watching the tokens of your\r\naspect now for months gone by, I should deem you a man sore sick, it\r\nmay be, yet not so sick but that an instructed and watchful physician\r\nmight well hope to cure you. But I know not what to say, the disease is\r\nwhat I seem to know, yet know it not.”\r\n\r\n“You speak in riddles, learned sir,” said the pale minister, glancing\r\naside out of the window.\r\n\r\n“Then, to speak more plainly,” continued the physician, “and I crave\r\npardon, sir, should it seem to require pardon, for this needful\r\nplainness of my speech. Let me ask as your friend, as one having\r\ncharge, under Providence, of your life and physical well being, hath\r\nall the operation of this disorder been fairly laid open and recounted\r\nto me?”\r\n\r\n“How can you question it?” asked the minister. “Surely it were child’s\r\nplay to call in a physician and then hide the sore!”\r\n\r\n“You would tell me, then, that I know all?” said Roger Chillingworth,\r\ndeliberately, and fixing an eye, bright with intense and concentrated\r\nintelligence, on the minister’s face. “Be it so! But again! He to whom\r\nonly the outward and physical evil is laid open, knoweth, oftentimes,\r\nbut half the evil which he is called upon to cure. A bodily disease,\r\nwhich we look upon as whole and entire within itself, may, after all,\r\nbe but a symptom of some ailment in the spiritual part. Your pardon\r\nonce again, good sir, if my speech give the shadow of offence. You,\r\nsir, of all men whom I have known, are he whose body is the closest\r\nconjoined, and imbued, and identified, so to speak, with the spirit\r\nwhereof it is the instrument.”\r\n\r\n“Then I need ask no further,” said the clergyman, somewhat hastily\r\nrising from his chair. “You deal not, I take it, in medicine for the\r\nsoul!”\r\n\r\n“Thus, a sickness,” continued Roger Chillingworth, going on, in an\r\nunaltered tone, without heeding the interruption, but standing up and\r\nconfronting the emaciated and white-cheeked minister, with his low,\r\ndark, and misshapen figure,—“a sickness, a sore place, if we may so\r\ncall it, in your spirit hath immediately its appropriate manifestation\r\nin your bodily frame. Would you, therefore, that your physician heal\r\nthe bodily evil? How may this be unless you first lay open to him the\r\nwound or trouble in your soul?”\r\n\r\n“No, not to thee! not to an earthly physician!” cried Mr. Dimmesdale,\r\npassionately, and turning his eyes, full and bright, and with a kind of\r\nfierceness, on old Roger Chillingworth. “Not to thee! But, if it be the\r\nsoul’s disease, then do I commit myself to the one Physician of the\r\nsoul! He, if it stand with His good pleasure, can cure, or he can kill.\r\nLet Him do with me as, in His justice and wisdom, He shall see good.\r\nBut who art thou, that meddlest in this matter? that dares thrust\r\nhimself between the sufferer and his God?”\r\n\r\nWith a frantic gesture he rushed out of the room.\r\n\r\n“It is as well to have made this step,” said Roger Chillingworth to\r\nhimself, looking after the minister, with a grave smile. “There is\r\nnothing lost. We shall be friends again anon. But see, now, how passion\r\ntakes hold upon this man, and hurrieth him out of himself! As with one\r\npassion so with another. He hath done a wild thing ere now, this pious\r\nMaster Dimmesdale, in the hot passion of his heart.”\r\n\r\nIt proved not difficult to re-establish the intimacy of the two\r\ncompanions, on the same footing and in the same degree as heretofore.\r\nThe young clergyman, after a few hours of privacy, was sensible that\r\nthe disorder of his nerves had hurried him into an unseemly outbreak of\r\ntemper, which there had been nothing in the physician’s words to excuse\r\nor palliate. He marvelled, indeed, at the violence with which he had\r\nthrust back the kind old man, when merely proffering the advice which\r\nit was his duty to bestow, and which the minister himself had expressly\r\nsought. With these remorseful feelings, he lost no time in making the\r\namplest apologies, and besought his friend still to continue the care\r\nwhich, if not successful in restoring him to health, had, in all\r\nprobability, been the means of prolonging his feeble existence to that\r\nhour. Roger Chillingworth readily assented, and went on with his\r\nmedical supervision of the minister; doing his best for him, in all\r\ngood faith, but always quitting the patient’s apartment, at the close\r\nof the professional interview, with a mysterious and puzzled smile upon\r\nhis lips. This expression was invisible in Mr. Dimmesdale’s presence,\r\nbut grew strongly evident as the physician crossed the threshold.\r\n\r\n“A rare case,” he muttered. “I must needs look deeper into it. A\r\nstrange sympathy betwixt soul and body! Were it only for the art’s\r\nsake, I must search this matter to the bottom.”\r\n\r\nIt came to pass, not long after the scene above recorded, that the\r\nReverend Mr. Dimmesdale, at noonday, and entirely unawares, fell into a\r\ndeep, deep slumber, sitting in his chair, with a large black-letter\r\nvolume open before him on the table. It must have been a work of vast\r\nability in the somniferous school of literature. The profound depth of\r\nthe minister’s repose was the more remarkable, inasmuch as he was one\r\nof those persons whose sleep ordinarily is as light as fitful, and as\r\neasily scared away, as a small bird hopping on a twig. To such an\r\nunwonted remoteness, however, had his spirit now withdrawn into itself\r\nthat he stirred not in his chair when old Roger Chillingworth, without\r\nany extraordinary precaution, came into the room. The physician\r\nadvanced directly in front of his patient, laid his hand upon his\r\nbosom, and thrust aside the vestment, that hitherto had always covered\r\nit even from the professional eye.\r\n\r\nThen, indeed, Mr. Dimmesdale shuddered, and slightly stirred.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief pause, the physician turned away.\r\n\r\nBut with what a wild look of wonder, joy, and horror! With what a\r\nghastly rapture, as it were, too mighty to be expressed only by the eye\r\nand features, and therefore bursting forth through the whole ugliness\r\nof his figure, and making itself even riotously manifest by the\r\nextravagant gestures with which he threw up his arms towards the\r\nceiling, and stamped his foot upon the floor! Had a man seen old Roger\r\nChillingworth, at that moment of his ecstasy, he would have had no need\r\nto ask how Satan comports himself when a precious human soul is lost to\r\nheaven, and won into his kingdom.\r\n\r\nBut what distinguished the physician’s ecstasy from Satan’s was the\r\ntrait of wonder in it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\nTHE INTERIOR OF A HEART\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the incident last described, the intercourse between the\r\nclergyman and the physician, though externally the same, was really of\r\nanother character than it had previously been. The intellect of Roger\r\nChillingworth had now a sufficiently plain path before it. It was not,\r\nindeed, precisely that which he had laid out for himself to tread.\r\nCalm, gentle, passionless, as he appeared, there was yet, we fear, a\r\nquiet depth of malice, hitherto latent, but active now, in this\r\nunfortunate old man, which led him to imagine a more intimate revenge\r\nthan any mortal had ever wreaked upon an enemy. To make himself the one\r\ntrusted friend, to whom should be confided all the fear, the remorse,\r\nthe agony, the ineffectual repentance, the backward rush of sinful\r\nthoughts, expelled in vain! All that guilty sorrow, hidden from the\r\nworld, whose great heart would have pitied and forgiven, to be revealed\r\nto him, the Pitiless—to him, the Unforgiving! All that dark treasure to\r\nbe lavished on the very man, to whom nothing else could so adequately\r\npay the debt of vengeance!\r\n\r\nThe clergyman’s shy and sensitive reserve had balked this scheme. Roger\r\nChillingworth, however, was inclined to be hardly, if at all, less\r\nsatisfied with the aspect of affairs, which Providence—using the\r\navenger and his victim for its own purposes, and, perchance, pardoning,\r\nwhere it seemed most to punish—had substituted for his black devices. A\r\nrevelation, he could almost say, had been granted to him. It mattered\r\nlittle for his object, whether celestial or from what other region. By\r\nits aid, in all the subsequent relations betwixt him and Mr.\r\nDimmesdale, not merely the external presence, but the very inmost soul\r\nof the latter, seemed to be brought out before his eyes, so that he\r\ncould see and comprehend its every movement. He became, thenceforth,\r\nnot a spectator only, but a chief actor in the poor minister’s interior\r\nworld. He could play upon him as he chose. Would he arouse him with a\r\nthrob of agony? The victim was for ever on the rack; it needed only to\r\nknow the spring that controlled the engine: and the physician knew it\r\nwell. Would he startle him with sudden fear? As at the waving of a\r\nmagician’s wand, up rose a grisly phantom—up rose a thousand\r\nphantoms—in many shapes, of death, or more awful shame, all flocking\r\nround about the clergyman, and pointing with their fingers at his\r\nbreast!\r\n\r\nAll this was accomplished with a subtlety so perfect, that the\r\nminister, though he had constantly a dim perception of some evil\r\ninfluence watching over him, could never gain a knowledge of its actual\r\nnature. True, he looked doubtfully, fearfully—even, at times, with\r\nhorror and the bitterness of hatred—at the deformed figure of the old\r\nphysician. His gestures, his gait, his grizzled beard, his slightest\r\nand most indifferent acts, the very fashion of his garments, were\r\nodious in the clergyman’s sight; a token implicitly to be relied on of\r\na deeper antipathy in the breast of the latter than he was willing to\r\nacknowledge to himself. For, as it was impossible to assign a reason\r\nfor such distrust and abhorrence, so Mr. Dimmesdale, conscious that the\r\npoison of one morbid spot was infecting his heart’s entire substance,\r\nattributed all his presentiments to no other cause. He took himself to\r\ntask for his bad sympathies in reference to Roger Chillingworth,\r\ndisregarded the lesson that he should have drawn from them, and did his\r\nbest to root them out. Unable to accomplish this, he nevertheless, as a\r\nmatter of principle, continued his habits of social familiarity with\r\nthe old man, and thus gave him constant opportunities for perfecting\r\nthe purpose to which—poor forlorn creature that he was, and more\r\nwretched than his victim—the avenger had devoted himself.\r\n\r\nWhile thus suffering under bodily disease, and gnawed and tortured by\r\nsome black trouble of the soul, and given over to the machinations of\r\nhis deadliest enemy, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale had achieved a\r\nbrilliant popularity in his sacred office. He won it indeed, in great\r\npart, by his sorrows. His intellectual gifts, his moral perceptions,\r\nhis power of experiencing and communicating emotion, were kept in a\r\nstate of preternatural activity by the prick and anguish of his daily\r\nlife. His fame, though still on its upward slope, already overshadowed\r\nthe soberer reputations of his fellow-clergymen, eminent as several of\r\nthem were. There are scholars among them, who had spent more years in\r\nacquiring abstruse lore, connected with the divine profession, than Mr.\r\nDimmesdale had lived; and who might well, therefore, be more profoundly\r\nversed in such solid and valuable attainments than their youthful\r\nbrother. There were men, too, of a sturdier texture of mind than his,\r\nand endowed with a far greater share of shrewd, hard iron, or granite\r\nunderstanding; which, duly mingled with a fair proportion of doctrinal\r\ningredient, constitutes a highly respectable, efficacious, and\r\nunamiable variety of the clerical species. There were others again,\r\ntrue saintly fathers, whose faculties had been elaborated by weary toil\r\namong their books, and by patient thought, and etherealised, moreover,\r\nby spiritual communications with the better world, into which their\r\npurity of life had almost introduced these holy personages, with their\r\ngarments of mortality still clinging to them. All that they lacked was,\r\nthe gift that descended upon the chosen disciples at Pentecost, in\r\ntongues of flame; symbolising, it would seem, not the power of speech\r\nin foreign and unknown languages, but that of addressing the whole\r\nhuman brotherhood in the heart’s native language. These fathers,\r\notherwise so apostolic, lacked Heaven’s last and rarest attestation of\r\ntheir office, the Tongue of Flame. They would have vainly sought—had\r\nthey ever dreamed of seeking—to express the highest truths through the\r\nhumblest medium of familiar words and images. Their voices came down,\r\nafar and indistinctly, from the upper heights where they habitually\r\ndwelt.\r\n\r\nNot improbably, it was to this latter class of men that Mr. Dimmesdale,\r\nby many of his traits of character, naturally belonged. To the high\r\nmountain peaks of faith and sanctity he would have climbed, had not the\r\ntendency been thwarted by the burden, whatever it might be, of crime or\r\nanguish, beneath which it was his doom to totter. It kept him down on a\r\nlevel with the lowest; him, the man of ethereal attributes, whose voice\r\nthe angels might else have listened to and answered! But this very\r\nburden it was that gave him sympathies so intimate with the sinful\r\nbrotherhood of mankind; so that his heart vibrated in unison with\r\ntheirs, and received their pain into itself and sent its own throb of\r\npain through a thousand other hearts, in gushes of sad, persuasive\r\neloquence. Oftenest persuasive, but sometimes terrible! The people knew\r\nnot the power that moved them thus. They deemed the young clergyman a\r\nmiracle of holiness. They fancied him the mouth-piece of Heaven’s\r\nmessages of wisdom, and rebuke, and love. In their eyes, the very\r\nground on which he trod was sanctified. The virgins of his church grew\r\npale around him, victims of a passion so imbued with religious\r\nsentiment, that they imagined it to be all religion, and brought it\r\nopenly, in their white bosoms, as their most acceptable sacrifice\r\nbefore the altar. The aged members of his flock, beholding Mr.\r\nDimmesdale’s frame so feeble, while they were themselves so rugged in\r\ntheir infirmity, believed that he would go heavenward before them, and\r\nenjoined it upon their children that their old bones should be buried\r\nclose to their young pastor’s holy grave. And all this time, perchance,\r\nwhen poor Mr. Dimmesdale was thinking of his grave, he questioned with\r\nhimself whether the grass would ever grow on it, because an accursed\r\nthing must there be buried!\r\n\r\nIt is inconceivable, the agony with which this public veneration\r\ntortured him. It was his genuine impulse to adore the truth, and to\r\nreckon all things shadow-like, and utterly devoid of weight or value,\r\nthat had not its divine essence as the life within their life. Then\r\nwhat was he?—a substance?—or the dimmest of all shadows? He longed to\r\nspeak out from his own pulpit at the full height of his voice, and tell\r\nthe people what he was. “I, whom you behold in these black garments of\r\nthe priesthood—I, who ascend the sacred desk, and turn my pale face\r\nheavenward, taking upon myself to hold communion in your behalf with\r\nthe Most High Omniscience—I, in whose daily life you discern the\r\nsanctity of Enoch—I, whose footsteps, as you suppose, leave a gleam\r\nalong my earthly track, whereby the Pilgrims that shall come after me\r\nmay be guided to the regions of the blest—I, who have laid the hand of\r\nbaptism upon your children—I, who have breathed the parting prayer over\r\nyour dying friends, to whom the Amen sounded faintly from a world which\r\nthey had quitted—I, your pastor, whom you so reverence and trust, am\r\nutterly a pollution and a lie!”\r\n\r\nMore than once, Mr. Dimmesdale had gone into the pulpit, with a purpose\r\nnever to come down its steps until he should have spoken words like the\r\nabove. More than once he had cleared his throat, and drawn in the long,\r\ndeep, and tremulous breath, which, when sent forth again, would come\r\nburdened with the black secret of his soul. More than once—nay, more\r\nthan a hundred times—he had actually spoken! Spoken! But how? He had\r\ntold his hearers that he was altogether vile, a viler companion of the\r\nvilest, the worst of sinners, an abomination, a thing of unimaginable\r\niniquity, and that the only wonder was that they did not see his\r\nwretched body shrivelled up before their eyes by the burning wrath of\r\nthe Almighty! Could there be plainer speech than this? Would not the\r\npeople start up in their seats, by a simultaneous impulse, and tear him\r\ndown out of the pulpit which he defiled? Not so, indeed! They heard it\r\nall, and did but reverence him the more. They little guessed what\r\ndeadly purport lurked in those self-condemning words. “The godly\r\nyouth!” said they among themselves. “The saint on earth! Alas! if he\r\ndiscern such sinfulness in his own white soul, what horrid spectacle\r\nwould he behold in thine or mine!” The minister well knew—subtle, but\r\nremorseful hypocrite that he was!—the light in which his vague\r\nconfession would be viewed. He had striven to put a cheat upon himself\r\nby making the avowal of a guilty conscience, but had gained only one\r\nother sin, and a self-acknowledged shame, without the momentary relief\r\nof being self-deceived. He had spoken the very truth, and transformed\r\nit into the veriest falsehood. And yet, by the constitution of his\r\nnature, he loved the truth, and loathed the lie, as few men ever did.\r\nTherefore, above all things else, he loathed his miserable self!\r\n\r\nHis inward trouble drove him to practices more in accordance with the\r\nold, corrupted faith of Rome than with the better light of the church\r\nin which he had been born and bred. In Mr. Dimmesdale’s secret closet,\r\nunder lock and key, there was a bloody scourge. Oftentimes, this\r\nProtestant and Puritan divine had plied it on his own shoulders,\r\nlaughing bitterly at himself the while, and smiting so much the more\r\npitilessly because of that bitter laugh. It was his custom, too, as it\r\nhas been that of many other pious Puritans, to fast—not however, like\r\nthem, in order to purify the body, and render it the fitter medium of\r\ncelestial illumination—but rigorously, and until his knees trembled\r\nbeneath him, as an act of penance. He kept vigils, likewise, night\r\nafter night, sometimes in utter darkness, sometimes with a glimmering\r\nlamp, and sometimes, viewing his own face in a looking-glass, by the\r\nmost powerful light which he could throw upon it. He thus typified the\r\nconstant introspection wherewith he tortured, but could not purify\r\nhimself. In these lengthened vigils, his brain often reeled, and\r\nvisions seemed to flit before him; perhaps seen doubtfully, and by a\r\nfaint light of their own, in the remote dimness of the chamber, or more\r\nvividly and close beside him, within the looking-glass. Now it was a\r\nherd of diabolic shapes, that grinned and mocked at the pale minister,\r\nand beckoned him away with them; now a group of shining angels, who\r\nflew upward heavily, as sorrow-laden, but grew more ethereal as they\r\nrose. Now came the dead friends of his youth, and his white-bearded\r\nfather, with a saint-like frown, and his mother turning her face away\r\nas she passed by. Ghost of a mother—thinnest fantasy of a\r\nmother—methinks she might yet have thrown a pitying glance towards her\r\nson! And now, through the chamber which these spectral thoughts had\r\nmade so ghastly, glided Hester Prynne leading along little Pearl, in\r\nher scarlet garb, and pointing her forefinger, first at the scarlet\r\nletter on her bosom, and then at the clergyman’s own breast.\r\n\r\nNone of these visions ever quite deluded him. At any moment, by an\r\neffort of his will, he could discern substances through their misty\r\nlack of substance, and convince himself that they were not solid in\r\ntheir nature, like yonder table of carved oak, or that big, square,\r\nleather-bound and brazen-clasped volume of divinity. But, for all that,\r\nthey were, in one sense, the truest and most substantial things which\r\nthe poor minister now dealt with. It is the unspeakable misery of a\r\nlife so false as his, that it steals the pith and substance out of\r\nwhatever realities there are around us, and which were meant by Heaven\r\nto be the spirit’s joy and nutriment. To the untrue man, the whole\r\nuniverse is false—it is impalpable—it shrinks to nothing within his\r\ngrasp. And he himself in so far as he shows himself in a false light,\r\nbecomes a shadow, or, indeed, ceases to exist. The only truth that\r\ncontinued to give Mr. Dimmesdale a real existence on this earth was the\r\nanguish in his inmost soul, and the undissembled expression of it in\r\nhis aspect. Had he once found power to smile, and wear a face of\r\ngaiety, there would have been no such man!\r\n\r\nOn one of those ugly nights, which we have faintly hinted at, but\r\nforborne to picture forth, the minister started from his chair. A new\r\nthought had struck him. There might be a moment’s peace in it. Attiring\r\nhimself with as much care as if it had been for public worship, and\r\nprecisely in the same manner, he stole softly down the staircase, undid\r\nthe door, and issued forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\nTHE MINISTER’S VIGIL\r\n\r\n\r\nWalking in the shadow of a dream, as it were, and perhaps actually\r\nunder the influence of a species of somnambulism, Mr. Dimmesdale\r\nreached the spot where, now so long since, Hester Prynne had lived\r\nthrough her first hours of public ignominy. The same platform or\r\nscaffold, black and weather-stained with the storm or sunshine of seven\r\nlong years, and foot-worn, too, with the tread of many culprits who had\r\nsince ascended it, remained standing beneath the balcony of the\r\nmeeting-house. The minister went up the steps.\r\n\r\nIt was an obscure night in early May. An unvaried pall of cloud muffled\r\nthe whole expanse of sky from zenith to horizon. If the same multitude\r\nwhich had stood as eye-witnesses while Hester Prynne sustained her\r\npunishment could now have been summoned forth, they would have\r\ndiscerned no face above the platform nor hardly the outline of a human\r\nshape, in the dark grey of the midnight. But the town was all asleep.\r\nThere was no peril of discovery. The minister might stand there, if it\r\nso pleased him, until morning should redden in the east, without other\r\nrisk than that the dank and chill night air would creep into his frame,\r\nand stiffen his joints with rheumatism, and clog his throat with\r\ncatarrh and cough; thereby defrauding the expectant audience of\r\ntomorrow’s prayer and sermon. No eye could see him, save that\r\never-wakeful one which had seen him in his closet, wielding the bloody\r\nscourge. Why, then, had he come hither? Was it but the mockery of\r\npenitence? A mockery, indeed, but in which his soul trifled with\r\nitself! A mockery at which angels blushed and wept, while fiends\r\nrejoiced with jeering laughter! He had been driven hither by the\r\nimpulse of that Remorse which dogged him everywhere, and whose own\r\nsister and closely linked companion was that Cowardice which invariably\r\ndrew him back, with her tremulous gripe, just when the other impulse\r\nhad hurried him to the verge of a disclosure. Poor, miserable man! what\r\nright had infirmity like his to burden itself with crime? Crime is for\r\nthe iron-nerved, who have their choice either to endure it, or, if it\r\npress too hard, to exert their fierce and savage strength for a good\r\npurpose, and fling it off at once! This feeble and most sensitive of\r\nspirits could do neither, yet continually did one thing or another,\r\nwhich intertwined, in the same inextricable knot, the agony of\r\nheaven-defying guilt and vain repentance.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, while standing on the scaffold, in this vain show of\r\nexpiation, Mr. Dimmesdale was overcome with a great horror of mind, as\r\nif the universe were gazing at a scarlet token on his naked breast,\r\nright over his heart. On that spot, in very truth, there was, and there\r\nhad long been, the gnawing and poisonous tooth of bodily pain. Without\r\nany effort of his will, or power to restrain himself, he shrieked\r\naloud: an outcry that went pealing through the night, and was beaten\r\nback from one house to another, and reverberated from the hills in the\r\nbackground; as if a company of devils, detecting so much misery and\r\nterror in it, had made a plaything of the sound, and were bandying it\r\nto and fro.\r\n\r\n“It is done!” muttered the minister, covering his face with his hands.\r\n“The whole town will awake and hurry forth, and find me here!”\r\n\r\nBut it was not so. The shriek had perhaps sounded with a far greater\r\npower, to his own startled ears, than it actually possessed. The town\r\ndid not awake; or, if it did, the drowsy slumberers mistook the cry\r\neither for something frightful in a dream, or for the noise of witches,\r\nwhose voices, at that period, were often heard to pass over the\r\nsettlements or lonely cottages, as they rode with Satan through the\r\nair. The clergyman, therefore, hearing no symptoms of disturbance,\r\nuncovered his eyes and looked about him. At one of the chamber-windows\r\nof Governor Bellingham’s mansion, which stood at some distance, on the\r\nline of another street, he beheld the appearance of the old magistrate\r\nhimself with a lamp in his hand a white night-cap on his head, and a\r\nlong white gown enveloping his figure. He looked like a ghost evoked\r\nunseasonably from the grave. The cry had evidently startled him. At\r\nanother window of the same house, moreover appeared old Mistress\r\nHibbins, the Governor’s sister, also with a lamp, which even thus far\r\noff revealed the expression of her sour and discontented face. She\r\nthrust forth her head from the lattice, and looked anxiously upward.\r\nBeyond the shadow of a doubt, this venerable witch-lady had heard Mr.\r\nDimmesdale’s outcry, and interpreted it, with its multitudinous echoes\r\nand reverberations, as the clamour of the fiends and night-hags, with\r\nwhom she was well known to make excursions in the forest.\r\n\r\nDetecting the gleam of Governor Bellingham’s lamp, the old lady quickly\r\nextinguished her own, and vanished. Possibly, she went up among the\r\nclouds. The minister saw nothing further of her motions. The\r\nmagistrate, after a wary observation of the darkness—into which,\r\nnevertheless, he could see but little further than he might into a\r\nmill-stone—retired from the window.\r\n\r\nThe minister grew comparatively calm. His eyes, however, were soon\r\ngreeted by a little glimmering light, which, at first a long way off\r\nwas approaching up the street. It threw a gleam of recognition, on here\r\na post, and there a garden fence, and here a latticed window-pane, and\r\nthere a pump, with its full trough of water, and here again an arched\r\ndoor of oak, with an iron knocker, and a rough log for the door-step.\r\nThe Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale noted all these minute particulars, even\r\nwhile firmly convinced that the doom of his existence was stealing\r\nonward, in the footsteps which he now heard; and that the gleam of the\r\nlantern would fall upon him in a few moments more, and reveal his\r\nlong-hidden secret. As the light drew nearer, he beheld, within its\r\nilluminated circle, his brother clergyman—or, to speak more accurately,\r\nhis professional father, as well as highly valued friend—the Reverend\r\nMr. Wilson, who, as Mr. Dimmesdale now conjectured, had been praying at\r\nthe bedside of some dying man. And so he had. The good old minister\r\ncame freshly from the death-chamber of Governor Winthrop, who had\r\npassed from earth to heaven within that very hour. And now surrounded,\r\nlike the saint-like personage of olden times, with a radiant halo, that\r\nglorified him amid this gloomy night of sin—as if the departed Governor\r\nhad left him an inheritance of his glory, or as if he had caught upon\r\nhimself the distant shine of the celestial city, while looking\r\nthitherward to see the triumphant pilgrim pass within its gates—now, in\r\nshort, good Father Wilson was moving homeward, aiding his footsteps\r\nwith a lighted lantern! The glimmer of this luminary suggested the\r\nabove conceits to Mr. Dimmesdale, who smiled—nay, almost laughed at\r\nthem—and then wondered if he was going mad.\r\n\r\nAs the Reverend Mr. Wilson passed beside the scaffold, closely muffling\r\nhis Geneva cloak about him with one arm, and holding the lantern before\r\nhis breast with the other, the minister could hardly restrain himself\r\nfrom speaking—\r\n\r\n“A good evening to you, venerable Father Wilson. Come up hither, I pray\r\nyou, and pass a pleasant hour with me!”\r\n\r\nGood Heavens! Had Mr. Dimmesdale actually spoken? For one instant he\r\nbelieved that these words had passed his lips. But they were uttered\r\nonly within his imagination. The venerable Father Wilson continued to\r\nstep slowly onward, looking carefully at the muddy pathway before his\r\nfeet, and never once turning his head towards the guilty platform. When\r\nthe light of the glimmering lantern had faded quite away, the minister\r\ndiscovered, by the faintness which came over him, that the last few\r\nmoments had been a crisis of terrible anxiety, although his mind had\r\nmade an involuntary effort to relieve itself by a kind of lurid\r\nplayfulness.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, the like grisly sense of the humorous again stole\r\nin among the solemn phantoms of his thought. He felt his limbs growing\r\nstiff with the unaccustomed chilliness of the night, and doubted\r\nwhether he should be able to descend the steps of the scaffold. Morning\r\nwould break and find him there. The neighbourhood would begin to rouse\r\nitself. The earliest riser, coming forth in the dim twilight, would\r\nperceive a vaguely-defined figure aloft on the place of shame; and\r\nhalf-crazed betwixt alarm and curiosity, would go knocking from door to\r\ndoor, summoning all the people to behold the ghost—as he needs must\r\nthink it—of some defunct transgressor. A dusky tumult would flap its\r\nwings from one house to another. Then—the morning light still waxing\r\nstronger—old patriarchs would rise up in great haste, each in his\r\nflannel gown, and matronly dames, without pausing to put off their\r\nnight-gear. The whole tribe of decorous personages, who had never\r\nheretofore been seen with a single hair of their heads awry, would\r\nstart into public view with the disorder of a nightmare in their\r\naspects. Old Governor Bellingham would come grimly forth, with his King\r\nJames’ ruff fastened askew, and Mistress Hibbins, with some twigs of\r\nthe forest clinging to her skirts, and looking sourer than ever, as\r\nhaving hardly got a wink of sleep after her night ride; and good Father\r\nWilson too, after spending half the night at a death-bed, and liking\r\nill to be disturbed, thus early, out of his dreams about the glorified\r\nsaints. Hither, likewise, would come the elders and deacons of Mr.\r\nDimmesdale’s church, and the young virgins who so idolized their\r\nminister, and had made a shrine for him in their white bosoms, which\r\nnow, by the by, in their hurry and confusion, they would scantly have\r\ngiven themselves time to cover with their kerchiefs. All people, in a\r\nword, would come stumbling over their thresholds, and turning up their\r\namazed and horror-stricken visages around the scaffold. Whom would they\r\ndiscern there, with the red eastern light upon his brow? Whom, but the\r\nReverend Arthur Dimmesdale, half-frozen to death, overwhelmed with\r\nshame, and standing where Hester Prynne had stood!\r\n\r\nCarried away by the grotesque horror of this picture, the minister,\r\nunawares, and to his own infinite alarm, burst into a great peal of\r\nlaughter. It was immediately responded to by a light, airy, childish\r\nlaugh, in which, with a thrill of the heart—but he knew not whether of\r\nexquisite pain, or pleasure as acute—he recognised the tones of little\r\nPearl.\r\n\r\n“Pearl! Little Pearl!” cried he, after a moment’s pause; then,\r\nsuppressing his voice—“Hester! Hester Prynne! Are you there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; it is Hester Prynne!” she replied, in a tone of surprise; and the\r\nminister heard her footsteps approaching from the side-walk, along\r\nwhich she had been passing. “It is I, and my little Pearl.”\r\n\r\n“Whence come you, Hester?” asked the minister. “What sent you hither?”\r\n\r\n“I have been watching at a death-bed,” answered Hester Prynne “at\r\nGovernor Winthrop’s death-bed, and have taken his measure for a robe,\r\nand am now going homeward to my dwelling.”\r\n\r\n“Come up hither, Hester, thou and little Pearl,” said the Reverend Mr.\r\nDimmesdale. “Ye have both been here before, but I was not with you.\r\nCome up hither once again, and we will stand all three together.”\r\n\r\nShe silently ascended the steps, and stood on the platform, holding\r\nlittle Pearl by the hand. The minister felt for the child’s other hand,\r\nand took it. The moment that he did so, there came what seemed a\r\ntumultuous rush of new life, other life than his own pouring like a\r\ntorrent into his heart, and hurrying through all his veins, as if the\r\nmother and the child were communicating their vital warmth to his\r\nhalf-torpid system. The three formed an electric chain.\r\n\r\n“Minister!” whispered little Pearl.\r\n\r\n“What wouldst thou say, child?” asked Mr. Dimmesdale.\r\n\r\n“Wilt thou stand here with mother and me, tomorrow noontide?” inquired\r\nPearl.\r\n\r\n“Nay; not so, my little Pearl,” answered the minister; for, with the\r\nnew energy of the moment, all the dread of public exposure, that had so\r\nlong been the anguish of his life, had returned upon him; and he was\r\nalready trembling at the conjunction in which—with a strange joy,\r\nnevertheless—he now found himself—“not so, my child. I shall, indeed,\r\nstand with thy mother and thee one other day, but not tomorrow.”\r\n\r\nPearl laughed, and attempted to pull away her hand. But the minister\r\nheld it fast.\r\n\r\n“A moment longer, my child!” said he.\r\n\r\n“But wilt thou promise,” asked Pearl, “to take my hand, and mother’s\r\nhand, tomorrow noontide?”\r\n\r\n“Not then, Pearl,” said the minister; “but another time.”\r\n\r\n“And what other time?” persisted the child.\r\n\r\n“At the great judgment day,” whispered the minister; and, strangely\r\nenough, the sense that he was a professional teacher of the truth\r\nimpelled him to answer the child so. “Then, and there, before the\r\njudgment-seat, thy mother, and thou, and I must stand together. But the\r\ndaylight of this world shall not see our meeting!”\r\n\r\nPearl laughed again.\r\n\r\nBut before Mr. Dimmesdale had done speaking, a light gleamed far and\r\nwide over all the muffled sky. It was doubtless caused by one of those\r\nmeteors, which the night-watcher may so often observe burning out to\r\nwaste, in the vacant regions of the atmosphere. So powerful was its\r\nradiance, that it thoroughly illuminated the dense medium of cloud\r\nbetwixt the sky and earth. The great vault brightened, like the dome of\r\nan immense lamp. It showed the familiar scene of the street with the\r\ndistinctness of mid-day, but also with the awfulness that is always\r\nimparted to familiar objects by an unaccustomed light. The wooden\r\nhouses, with their jutting storeys and quaint gable-peaks; the\r\ndoorsteps and thresholds with the early grass springing up about them;\r\nthe garden-plots, black with freshly-turned earth; the wheel-track,\r\nlittle worn, and even in the market-place margined with green on either\r\nside—all were visible, but with a singularity of aspect that seemed to\r\ngive another moral interpretation to the things of this world than they\r\nhad ever borne before. And there stood the minister, with his hand over\r\nhis heart; and Hester Prynne, with the embroidered letter glimmering on\r\nher bosom; and little Pearl, herself a symbol, and the connecting link\r\nbetween those two. They stood in the noon of that strange and solemn\r\nsplendour, as if it were the light that is to reveal all secrets, and\r\nthe daybreak that shall unite all who belong to one another.\r\n\r\nThere was witchcraft in little Pearl’s eyes; and her face, as she\r\nglanced upward at the minister, wore that naughty smile which made its\r\nexpression frequently so elvish. She withdrew her hand from Mr.\r\nDimmesdale’s, and pointed across the street. But he clasped both his\r\nhands over his breast, and cast his eyes towards the zenith.\r\n\r\nNothing was more common, in those days, than to interpret all meteoric\r\nappearances, and other natural phenomena that occurred with less\r\nregularity than the rise and set of sun and moon, as so many\r\nrevelations from a supernatural source. Thus, a blazing spear, a sword\r\nof flame, a bow, or a sheaf of arrows seen in the midnight sky,\r\nprefigured Indian warfare. Pestilence was known to have been foreboded\r\nby a shower of crimson light. We doubt whether any marked event, for\r\ngood or evil, ever befell New England, from its settlement down to\r\nrevolutionary times, of which the inhabitants had not been previously\r\nwarned by some spectacle of its nature. Not seldom, it had been seen by\r\nmultitudes. Oftener, however, its credibility rested on the faith of\r\nsome lonely eye-witness, who beheld the wonder through the coloured,\r\nmagnifying, and distorted medium of his imagination, and shaped it more\r\ndistinctly in his after-thought. It was, indeed, a majestic idea that\r\nthe destiny of nations should be revealed, in these awful\r\nhieroglyphics, on the cope of heaven. A scroll so wide might not be\r\ndeemed too expensive for Providence to write a people’s doom upon. The\r\nbelief was a favourite one with our forefathers, as betokening that\r\ntheir infant commonwealth was under a celestial guardianship of\r\npeculiar intimacy and strictness. But what shall we say, when an\r\nindividual discovers a revelation addressed to himself alone, on the\r\nsame vast sheet of record. In such a case, it could only be the symptom\r\nof a highly disordered mental state, when a man, rendered morbidly\r\nself-contemplative by long, intense, and secret pain, had extended his\r\negotism over the whole expanse of nature, until the firmament itself\r\nshould appear no more than a fitting page for his soul’s history and\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nWe impute it, therefore, solely to the disease in his own eye and heart\r\nthat the minister, looking upward to the zenith, beheld there the\r\nappearance of an immense letter—the letter A—marked out in lines of\r\ndull red light. Not but the meteor may have shown itself at that point,\r\nburning duskily through a veil of cloud, but with no such shape as his\r\nguilty imagination gave it, or, at least, with so little definiteness,\r\nthat another’s guilt might have seen another symbol in it.\r\n\r\nThere was a singular circumstance that characterised Mr. Dimmesdale’s\r\npsychological state at this moment. All the time that he gazed upward\r\nto the zenith, he was, nevertheless, perfectly aware that little Pearl\r\nwas pointing her finger towards old Roger Chillingworth, who stood at\r\nno great distance from the scaffold. The minister appeared to see him,\r\nwith the same glance that discerned the miraculous letter. To his\r\nfeature as to all other objects, the meteoric light imparted a new\r\nexpression; or it might well be that the physician was not careful\r\nthen, as at all other times, to hide the malevolence with which he\r\nlooked upon his victim. Certainly, if the meteor kindled up the sky,\r\nand disclosed the earth, with an awfulness that admonished Hester\r\nPrynne and the clergyman of the day of judgment, then might Roger\r\nChillingworth have passed with them for the arch-fiend, standing there\r\nwith a smile and scowl, to claim his own. So vivid was the expression,\r\nor so intense the minister’s perception of it, that it seemed still to\r\nremain painted on the darkness after the meteor had vanished, with an\r\neffect as if the street and all things else were at once annihilated.\r\n\r\n“Who is that man, Hester?” gasped Mr. Dimmesdale, overcome with terror.\r\n“I shiver at him! Dost thou know the man? I hate him, Hester!”\r\n\r\nShe remembered her oath, and was silent.\r\n\r\n“I tell thee, my soul shivers at him!” muttered the minister again.\r\n“Who is he? Who is he? Canst thou do nothing for me? I have a nameless\r\nhorror of the man!”\r\n\r\n“Minister,” said little Pearl, “I can tell thee who he is!”\r\n\r\n“Quickly, then, child!” said the minister, bending his ear close to her\r\nlips. “Quickly, and as low as thou canst whisper.”\r\n\r\nPearl mumbled something into his ear that sounded, indeed, like human\r\nlanguage, but was only such gibberish as children may be heard amusing\r\nthemselves with by the hour together. At all events, if it involved any\r\nsecret information in regard to old Roger Chillingworth, it was in a\r\ntongue unknown to the erudite clergyman, and did but increase the\r\nbewilderment of his mind. The elvish child then laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n“Dost thou mock me now?” said the minister.\r\n\r\n“Thou wast not bold!—thou wast not true!” answered the child. “Thou\r\nwouldst not promise to take my hand, and mother’s hand, tomorrow\r\nnoontide!”\r\n\r\n“Worthy sir,” answered the physician, who had now advanced to the foot\r\nof the platform—“pious Master Dimmesdale! can this be you? Well, well,\r\nindeed! We men of study, whose heads are in our books, have need to be\r\nstraitly looked after! We dream in our waking moments, and walk in our\r\nsleep. Come, good sir, and my dear friend, I pray you let me lead you\r\nhome!”\r\n\r\n“How knewest thou that I was here?” asked the minister, fearfully.\r\n\r\n“Verily, and in good faith,” answered Roger Chillingworth, “I knew\r\nnothing of the matter. I had spent the better part of the night at the\r\nbedside of the worshipful Governor Winthrop, doing what my poor skill\r\nmight to give him ease. He, going home to a better world, I, likewise,\r\nwas on my way homeward, when this light shone out. Come with me, I\r\nbeseech you, Reverend sir, else you will be poorly able to do Sabbath\r\nduty tomorrow. Aha! see now how they trouble the brain—these\r\nbooks!—these books! You should study less, good sir, and take a little\r\npastime, or these night whimsies will grow upon you.”\r\n\r\n“I will go home with you,” said Mr. Dimmesdale.\r\n\r\nWith a chill despondency, like one awakening, all nerveless, from an\r\nugly dream, he yielded himself to the physician, and was led away.\r\n\r\nThe next day, however, being the Sabbath, he preached a discourse which\r\nwas held to be the richest and most powerful, and the most replete with\r\nheavenly influences, that had ever proceeded from his lips. Souls, it\r\nis said, more souls than one, were brought to the truth by the efficacy\r\nof that sermon, and vowed within themselves to cherish a holy gratitude\r\ntowards Mr. Dimmesdale throughout the long hereafter. But as he came\r\ndown the pulpit steps, the grey-bearded sexton met him, holding up a\r\nblack glove, which the minister recognised as his own.\r\n\r\n“It was found,” said the Sexton, “this morning on the scaffold where\r\nevil-doers are set up to public shame. Satan dropped it there, I take\r\nit, intending a scurrilous jest against your reverence. But, indeed, he\r\nwas blind and foolish, as he ever and always is. A pure hand needs no\r\nglove to cover it!”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, my good friend,” said the minister, gravely, but startled\r\nat heart; for so confused was his remembrance, that he had almost\r\nbrought himself to look at the events of the past night as visionary.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it seems to be my glove, indeed!”\r\n\r\n“And, since Satan saw fit to steal it, your reverence must needs handle\r\nhim without gloves henceforward,” remarked the old sexton, grimly\r\nsmiling. “But did your reverence hear of the portent that was seen last\r\nnight? a great red letter in the sky—the letter A, which we interpret\r\nto stand for Angel. For, as our good Governor Winthrop was made an\r\nangel this past night, it was doubtless held fit that there should be\r\nsome notice thereof!”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the minister; “I had not heard of it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\nANOTHER VIEW OF HESTER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn her late singular interview with Mr. Dimmesdale, Hester Prynne was\r\nshocked at the condition to which she found the clergyman reduced. His\r\nnerve seemed absolutely destroyed. His moral force was abased into more\r\nthan childish weakness. It grovelled helpless on the ground, even while\r\nhis intellectual faculties retained their pristine strength, or had\r\nperhaps acquired a morbid energy, which disease only could have given\r\nthem. With her knowledge of a train of circumstances hidden from all\r\nothers, she could readily infer that, besides the legitimate action of\r\nhis own conscience, a terrible machinery had been brought to bear, and\r\nwas still operating, on Mr. Dimmesdale’s well-being and repose. Knowing\r\nwhat this poor fallen man had once been, her whole soul was moved by\r\nthe shuddering terror with which he had appealed to her—the outcast\r\nwoman—for support against his instinctively discovered enemy. She\r\ndecided, moreover, that he had a right to her utmost aid. Little\r\naccustomed, in her long seclusion from society, to measure her ideas of\r\nright and wrong by any standard external to herself, Hester saw—or\r\nseemed to see—that there lay a responsibility upon her in reference to\r\nthe clergyman, which she owned to no other, nor to the whole world\r\nbesides. The links that united her to the rest of humankind—links of\r\nflowers, or silk, or gold, or whatever the material—had all been\r\nbroken. Here was the iron link of mutual crime, which neither he nor\r\nshe could break. Like all other ties, it brought along with it its\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nHester Prynne did not now occupy precisely the same position in which\r\nwe beheld her during the earlier periods of her ignominy. Years had\r\ncome and gone. Pearl was now seven years old. Her mother, with the\r\nscarlet letter on her breast, glittering in its fantastic embroidery,\r\nhad long been a familiar object to the townspeople. As is apt to be the\r\ncase when a person stands out in any prominence before the community,\r\nand, at the same time, interferes neither with public nor individual\r\ninterests and convenience, a species of general regard had ultimately\r\ngrown up in reference to Hester Prynne. It is to the credit of human\r\nnature that, except where its selfishness is brought into play, it\r\nloves more readily than it hates. Hatred, by a gradual and quiet\r\nprocess, will even be transformed to love, unless the change be impeded\r\nby a continually new irritation of the original feeling of hostility.\r\nIn this matter of Hester Prynne there was neither irritation nor\r\nirksomeness. She never battled with the public, but submitted\r\nuncomplainingly to its worst usage; she made no claim upon it in\r\nrequital for what she suffered; she did not weigh upon its sympathies.\r\nThen, also, the blameless purity of her life during all these years in\r\nwhich she had been set apart to infamy was reckoned largely in her\r\nfavour. With nothing now to lose, in the sight of mankind, and with no\r\nhope, and seemingly no wish, of gaining anything, it could only be a\r\ngenuine regard for virtue that had brought back the poor wanderer to\r\nits paths.\r\n\r\nIt was perceived, too, that while Hester never put forward even the\r\nhumblest title to share in the world’s privileges—further than to\r\nbreathe the common air and earn daily bread for little Pearl and\r\nherself by the faithful labour of her hands—she was quick to\r\nacknowledge her sisterhood with the race of man whenever benefits were\r\nto be conferred. None so ready as she to give of her little substance\r\nto every demand of poverty, even though the bitter-hearted pauper threw\r\nback a gibe in requital of the food brought regularly to his door, or\r\nthe garments wrought for him by the fingers that could have embroidered\r\na monarch’s robe. None so self-devoted as Hester when pestilence\r\nstalked through the town. In all seasons of calamity, indeed, whether\r\ngeneral or of individuals, the outcast of society at once found her\r\nplace. She came, not as a guest, but as a rightful inmate, into the\r\nhousehold that was darkened by trouble, as if its gloomy twilight were\r\na medium in which she was entitled to hold intercourse with her\r\nfellow-creature. There glimmered the embroidered letter, with comfort\r\nin its unearthly ray. Elsewhere the token of sin, it was the taper of\r\nthe sick chamber. It had even thrown its gleam, in the sufferer’s hard\r\nextremity, across the verge of time. It had shown him where to set his\r\nfoot, while the light of earth was fast becoming dim, and ere the light\r\nof futurity could reach him. In such emergencies Hester’s nature showed\r\nitself warm and rich—a well-spring of human tenderness, unfailing to\r\nevery real demand, and inexhaustible by the largest. Her breast, with\r\nits badge of shame, was but the softer pillow for the head that needed\r\none. She was self-ordained a Sister of Mercy, or, we may rather say,\r\nthe world’s heavy hand had so ordained her, when neither the world nor\r\nshe looked forward to this result. The letter was the symbol of her\r\ncalling. Such helpfulness was found in her—so much power to do, and\r\npower to sympathise—that many people refused to interpret the scarlet A\r\nby its original signification. They said that it meant Able, so strong\r\nwas Hester Prynne, with a woman’s strength.\r\n\r\nIt was only the darkened house that could contain her. When sunshine\r\ncame again, she was not there. Her shadow had faded across the\r\nthreshold. The helpful inmate had departed, without one backward glance\r\nto gather up the meed of gratitude, if any were in the hearts of those\r\nwhom she had served so zealously. Meeting them in the street, she never\r\nraised her head to receive their greeting. If they were resolute to\r\naccost her, she laid her finger on the scarlet letter, and passed on.\r\nThis might be pride, but was so like humility, that it produced all the\r\nsoftening influence of the latter quality on the public mind. The\r\npublic is despotic in its temper; it is capable of denying common\r\njustice when too strenuously demanded as a right; but quite as\r\nfrequently it awards more than justice, when the appeal is made, as\r\ndespots love to have it made, entirely to its generosity. Interpreting\r\nHester Prynne’s deportment as an appeal of this nature, society was\r\ninclined to show its former victim a more benign countenance than she\r\ncared to be favoured with, or, perchance, than she deserved.\r\n\r\nThe rulers, and the wise and learned men of the community, were longer\r\nin acknowledging the influence of Hester’s good qualities than the\r\npeople. The prejudices which they shared in common with the latter were\r\nfortified in themselves by an iron frame-work of reasoning, that made\r\nit a far tougher labour to expel them. Day by day, nevertheless, their\r\nsour and rigid wrinkles were relaxing into something which, in the due\r\ncourse of years, might grow to be an expression of almost benevolence.\r\nThus it was with the men of rank, on whom their eminent position\r\nimposed the guardianship of the public morals. Individuals in private\r\nlife, meanwhile, had quite forgiven Hester Prynne for her frailty; nay,\r\nmore, they had begun to look upon the scarlet letter as the token, not\r\nof that one sin for which she had borne so long and dreary a penance,\r\nbut of her many good deeds since. “Do you see that woman with the\r\nembroidered badge?” they would say to strangers. “It is our Hester—the\r\ntown’s own Hester—who is so kind to the poor, so helpful to the sick,\r\nso comfortable to the afflicted!” Then, it is true, the propensity of\r\nhuman nature to tell the very worst of itself, when embodied in the\r\nperson of another, would constrain them to whisper the black scandal of\r\nbygone years. It was none the less a fact, however, that in the eyes of\r\nthe very men who spoke thus, the scarlet letter had the effect of the\r\ncross on a nun’s bosom. It imparted to the wearer a kind of sacredness,\r\nwhich enabled her to walk securely amid all peril. Had she fallen among\r\nthieves, it would have kept her safe. It was reported, and believed by\r\nmany, that an Indian had drawn his arrow against the badge, and that\r\nthe missile struck it, and fell harmless to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the symbol—or rather, of the position in respect to\r\nsociety that was indicated by it—on the mind of Hester Prynne herself\r\nwas powerful and peculiar. All the light and graceful foliage of her\r\ncharacter had been withered up by this red-hot brand, and had long ago\r\nfallen away, leaving a bare and harsh outline, which might have been\r\nrepulsive had she possessed friends or companions to be repelled by it.\r\nEven the attractiveness of her person had undergone a similar change.\r\nIt might be partly owing to the studied austerity of her dress, and\r\npartly to the lack of demonstration in her manners. It was a sad\r\ntransformation, too, that her rich and luxuriant hair had either been\r\ncut off, or was so completely hidden by a cap, that not a shining lock\r\nof it ever once gushed into the sunshine. It was due in part to all\r\nthese causes, but still more to something else, that there seemed to be\r\nno longer anything in Hester’s face for Love to dwell upon; nothing in\r\nHester’s form, though majestic and statue-like, that Passion would ever\r\ndream of clasping in its embrace; nothing in Hester’s bosom to make it\r\never again the pillow of Affection. Some attribute had departed from\r\nher, the permanence of which had been essential to keep her a woman.\r\nSuch is frequently the fate, and such the stern development, of the\r\nfeminine character and person, when the woman has encountered, and\r\nlived through, an experience of peculiar severity. If she be all\r\ntenderness, she will die. If she survive, the tenderness will either be\r\ncrushed out of her, or—and the outward semblance is the same—crushed so\r\ndeeply into her heart that it can never show itself more. The latter is\r\nperhaps the truest theory. She who has once been a woman, and ceased to\r\nbe so, might at any moment become a woman again, if there were only the\r\nmagic touch to effect the transformation. We shall see whether Hester\r\nPrynne were ever afterwards so touched and so transfigured.\r\n\r\nMuch of the marble coldness of Hester’s impression was to be attributed\r\nto the circumstance that her life had turned, in a great measure, from\r\npassion and feeling to thought. Standing alone in the world—alone, as\r\nto any dependence on society, and with little Pearl to be guided and\r\nprotected—alone, and hopeless of retrieving her position, even had she\r\nnot scorned to consider it desirable—she cast away the fragment of a\r\nbroken chain. The world’s law was no law for her mind. It was an age in\r\nwhich the human intellect, newly emancipated, had taken a more active\r\nand a wider range than for many centuries before. Men of the sword had\r\noverthrown nobles and kings. Men bolder than these had overthrown and\r\nrearranged—not actually, but within the sphere of theory, which was\r\ntheir most real abode—the whole system of ancient prejudice, wherewith\r\nwas linked much of ancient principle. Hester Prynne imbibed this\r\nspirit. She assumed a freedom of speculation, then common enough on the\r\nother side of the Atlantic, but which our forefathers, had they known\r\nit, would have held to be a deadlier crime than that stigmatised by the\r\nscarlet letter. In her lonesome cottage, by the sea-shore, thoughts\r\nvisited her such as dared to enter no other dwelling in New England;\r\nshadowy guests, that would have been as perilous as demons to their\r\nentertainer, could they have been seen so much as knocking at her door.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that persons who speculate the most boldly often\r\nconform with the most perfect quietude to the external regulations of\r\nsociety. The thought suffices them, without investing itself in the\r\nflesh and blood of action. So it seemed to be with Hester. Yet, had\r\nlittle Pearl never come to her from the spiritual world, it might have\r\nbeen far otherwise. Then she might have come down to us in history,\r\nhand in hand with Ann Hutchinson, as the foundress of a religious sect.\r\nShe might, in one of her phases, have been a prophetess. She might, and\r\nnot improbably would, have suffered death from the stern tribunals of\r\nthe period, for attempting to undermine the foundations of the Puritan\r\nestablishment. But, in the education of her child, the mother’s\r\nenthusiasm of thought had something to wreak itself upon. Providence,\r\nin the person of this little girl, had assigned to Hester’s charge, the\r\ngerm and blossom of womanhood, to be cherished and developed amid a\r\nhost of difficulties. Everything was against her. The world was\r\nhostile. The child’s own nature had something wrong in it which\r\ncontinually betokened that she had been born amiss—the effluence of her\r\nmother’s lawless passion—and often impelled Hester to ask, in\r\nbitterness of heart, whether it were for ill or good that the poor\r\nlittle creature had been born at all.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the same dark question often rose into her mind with reference\r\nto the whole race of womanhood. Was existence worth accepting even to\r\nthe happiest among them? As concerned her own individual existence, she\r\nhad long ago decided in the negative, and dismissed the point as\r\nsettled. A tendency to speculation, though it may keep women quiet, as\r\nit does man, yet makes her sad. She discerns, it may be, such a\r\nhopeless task before her. As a first step, the whole system of society\r\nis to be torn down and built up anew. Then the very nature of the\r\nopposite sex, or its long hereditary habit, which has become like\r\nnature, is to be essentially modified before woman can be allowed to\r\nassume what seems a fair and suitable position. Finally, all other\r\ndifficulties being obviated, woman cannot take advantage of these\r\npreliminary reforms until she herself shall have undergone a still\r\nmightier change, in which, perhaps, the ethereal essence, wherein she\r\nhas her truest life, will be found to have evaporated. A woman never\r\novercomes these problems by any exercise of thought. They are not to be\r\nsolved, or only in one way. If her heart chance to come uppermost, they\r\nvanish. Thus Hester Prynne, whose heart had lost its regular and\r\nhealthy throb, wandered without a clue in the dark labyrinth of mind;\r\nnow turned aside by an insurmountable precipice; now starting back from\r\na deep chasm. There was wild and ghastly scenery all around her, and a\r\nhome and comfort nowhere. At times a fearful doubt strove to possess\r\nher soul, whether it were not better to send Pearl at once to Heaven,\r\nand go herself to such futurity as Eternal Justice should provide.\r\n\r\nThe scarlet letter had not done its office. Now, however, her interview\r\nwith the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, on the night of his vigil, had given\r\nher a new theme of reflection, and held up to her an object that\r\nappeared worthy of any exertion and sacrifice for its attainment. She\r\nhad witnessed the intense misery beneath which the minister struggled,\r\nor, to speak more accurately, had ceased to struggle. She saw that he\r\nstood on the verge of lunacy, if he had not already stepped across it.\r\nIt was impossible to doubt that, whatever painful efficacy there might\r\nbe in the secret sting of remorse, a deadlier venom had been infused\r\ninto it by the hand that proffered relief. A secret enemy had been\r\ncontinually by his side, under the semblance of a friend and helper,\r\nand had availed himself of the opportunities thus afforded for\r\ntampering with the delicate springs of Mr. Dimmesdale’s nature. Hester\r\ncould not but ask herself whether there had not originally been a\r\ndefect of truth, courage, and loyalty on her own part, in allowing the\r\nminister to be thrown into a position where so much evil was to be\r\nforeboded and nothing auspicious to be hoped. Her only justification\r\nlay in the fact that she had been able to discern no method of rescuing\r\nhim from a blacker ruin than had overwhelmed herself except by\r\nacquiescing in Roger Chillingworth’s scheme of disguise. Under that\r\nimpulse she had made her choice, and had chosen, as it now appeared,\r\nthe more wretched alternative of the two. She determined to redeem her\r\nerror so far as it might yet be possible. Strengthened by years of hard\r\nand solemn trial, she felt herself no longer so inadequate to cope with\r\nRoger Chillingworth as on that night, abased by sin and half-maddened\r\nby the ignominy that was still new, when they had talked together in\r\nthe prison-chamber. She had climbed her way since then to a higher\r\npoint. The old man, on the other hand, had brought himself nearer to\r\nher level, or, perhaps, below it, by the revenge which he had stooped\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nIn fine, Hester Prynne resolved to meet her former husband, and do what\r\nmight be in her power for the rescue of the victim on whom he had so\r\nevidently set his gripe. The occasion was not long to seek. One\r\nafternoon, walking with Pearl in a retired part of the peninsula, she\r\nbeheld the old physician with a basket on one arm and a staff in the\r\nother hand, stooping along the ground in quest of roots and herbs to\r\nconcoct his medicine withal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\nHESTER AND THE PHYSICIAN\r\n\r\n\r\nHester bade little Pearl run down to the margin of the water, and play\r\nwith the shells and tangled sea-weed, until she should have talked\r\nawhile with yonder gatherer of herbs. So the child flew away like a\r\nbird, and, making bare her small white feet went pattering along the\r\nmoist margin of the sea. Here and there she came to a full stop, and\r\npeeped curiously into a pool, left by the retiring tide as a mirror for\r\nPearl to see her face in. Forth peeped at her, out of the pool, with\r\ndark, glistening curls around her head, and an elf-smile in her eyes,\r\nthe image of a little maid whom Pearl, having no other playmate,\r\ninvited to take her hand and run a race with her. But the visionary\r\nlittle maid on her part, beckoned likewise, as if to say—“This is a\r\nbetter place; come thou into the pool.” And Pearl, stepping in mid-leg\r\ndeep, beheld her own white feet at the bottom; while, out of a still\r\nlower depth, came the gleam of a kind of fragmentary smile, floating to\r\nand fro in the agitated water.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile her mother had accosted the physician. “I would speak a word\r\nwith you,” said she—“a word that concerns us much.”\r\n\r\n“Aha! and is it Mistress Hester that has a word for old Roger\r\nChillingworth?” answered he, raising himself from his stooping posture.\r\n“With all my heart! Why, mistress, I hear good tidings of you on all\r\nhands! No longer ago than yester-eve, a magistrate, a wise and godly\r\nman, was discoursing of your affairs, Mistress Hester, and whispered me\r\nthat there had been question concerning you in the council. It was\r\ndebated whether or no, with safety to the commonweal, yonder scarlet\r\nletter might be taken off your bosom. On my life, Hester, I made my\r\nintreaty to the worshipful magistrate that it might be done forthwith.”\r\n\r\n“It lies not in the pleasure of the magistrates to take off the badge,”\r\ncalmly replied Hester. “Were I worthy to be quit of it, it would fall\r\naway of its own nature, or be transformed into something that should\r\nspeak a different purport.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, then, wear it, if it suit you better,” rejoined he, “A woman must\r\nneeds follow her own fancy touching the adornment of her person. The\r\nletter is gaily embroidered, and shows right bravely on your bosom!”\r\n\r\nAll this while Hester had been looking steadily at the old man, and was\r\nshocked, as well as wonder-smitten, to discern what a change had been\r\nwrought upon him within the past seven years. It was not so much that\r\nhe had grown older; for though the traces of advancing life were\r\nvisible, he bore his age well, and seemed to retain a wiry vigour and\r\nalertness. But the former aspect of an intellectual and studious man,\r\ncalm and quiet, which was what she best remembered in him, had\r\naltogether vanished, and been succeeded by an eager, searching, almost\r\nfierce, yet carefully guarded look. It seemed to be his wish and\r\npurpose to mask this expression with a smile, but the latter played him\r\nfalse, and flickered over his visage so derisively that the spectator\r\ncould see his blackness all the better for it. Ever and anon, too,\r\nthere came a glare of red light out of his eyes, as if the old man’s\r\nsoul were on fire and kept on smouldering duskily within his breast,\r\nuntil by some casual puff of passion it was blown into a momentary\r\nflame. This he repressed as speedily as possible, and strove to look as\r\nif nothing of the kind had happened.\r\n\r\nIn a word, old Roger Chillingworth was a striking evidence of man’s\r\nfaculty of transforming himself into a devil, if he will only, for a\r\nreasonable space of time, undertake a devil’s office. This unhappy\r\nperson had effected such a transformation by devoting himself for seven\r\nyears to the constant analysis of a heart full of torture, and deriving\r\nhis enjoyment thence, and adding fuel to those fiery tortures which he\r\nanalysed and gloated over.\r\n\r\nThe scarlet letter burned on Hester Prynne’s bosom. Here was another\r\nruin, the responsibility of which came partly home to her.\r\n\r\n“What see you in my face,” asked the physician, “that you look at it so\r\nearnestly?”\r\n\r\n“Something that would make me weep, if there were any tears bitter\r\nenough for it,” answered she. “But let it pass! It is of yonder\r\nmiserable man that I would speak.”\r\n\r\n“And what of him?” cried Roger Chillingworth, eagerly, as if he loved\r\nthe topic, and were glad of an opportunity to discuss it with the only\r\nperson of whom he could make a confidant. “Not to hide the truth,\r\nMistress Hester, my thoughts happen just now to be busy with the\r\ngentleman. So speak freely and I will make answer.”\r\n\r\n“When we last spake together,” said Hester, “now seven years ago, it\r\nwas your pleasure to extort a promise of secrecy as touching the former\r\nrelation betwixt yourself and me. As the life and good fame of yonder\r\nman were in your hands there seemed no choice to me, save to be silent\r\nin accordance with your behest. Yet it was not without heavy misgivings\r\nthat I thus bound myself, for, having cast off all duty towards other\r\nhuman beings, there remained a duty towards him, and something\r\nwhispered me that I was betraying it in pledging myself to keep your\r\ncounsel. Since that day no man is so near to him as you. You tread\r\nbehind his every footstep. You are beside him, sleeping and waking. You\r\nsearch his thoughts. You burrow and rankle in his heart! Your clutch is\r\non his life, and you cause him to die daily a living death, and still\r\nhe knows you not. In permitting this I have surely acted a false part\r\nby the only man to whom the power was left me to be true!”\r\n\r\n“What choice had you?” asked Roger Chillingworth. “My finger, pointed\r\nat this man, would have hurled him from his pulpit into a dungeon,\r\nthence, peradventure, to the gallows!”\r\n\r\n“It had been better so!” said Hester Prynne.\r\n\r\n“What evil have I done the man?” asked Roger Chillingworth again. “I\r\ntell thee, Hester Prynne, the richest fee that ever physician earned\r\nfrom monarch could not have bought such care as I have wasted on this\r\nmiserable priest! But for my aid his life would have burned away in\r\ntorments within the first two years after the perpetration of his crime\r\nand thine. For, Hester, his spirit lacked the strength that could have\r\nborne up, as thine has, beneath a burden like thy scarlet letter. Oh, I\r\ncould reveal a goodly secret! But enough. What art can do, I have\r\nexhausted on him. That he now breathes and creeps about on earth is\r\nowing all to me!”\r\n\r\n“Better he had died at once!” said Hester Prynne.\r\n\r\n“Yea, woman, thou sayest truly!” cried old Roger Chillingworth, letting\r\nthe lurid fire of his heart blaze out before her eyes. “Better had he\r\ndied at once! Never did mortal suffer what this man has suffered. And\r\nall, all, in the sight of his worst enemy! He has been conscious of me.\r\nHe has felt an influence dwelling always upon him like a curse. He\r\nknew, by some spiritual sense—for the Creator never made another being\r\nso sensitive as this—he knew that no friendly hand was pulling at his\r\nheartstrings, and that an eye was looking curiously into him, which\r\nsought only evil, and found it. But he knew not that the eye and hand\r\nwere mine! With the superstition common to his brotherhood, he fancied\r\nhimself given over to a fiend, to be tortured with frightful dreams and\r\ndesperate thoughts, the sting of remorse and despair of pardon, as a\r\nforetaste of what awaits him beyond the grave. But it was the constant\r\nshadow of my presence, the closest propinquity of the man whom he had\r\nmost vilely wronged, and who had grown to exist only by this perpetual\r\npoison of the direst revenge! Yea, indeed, he did not err, there was a\r\nfiend at his elbow! A mortal man, with once a human heart, has become a\r\nfiend for his especial torment.”\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate physician, while uttering these words, lifted his hands\r\nwith a look of horror, as if he had beheld some frightful shape, which\r\nhe could not recognise, usurping the place of his own image in a glass.\r\nIt was one of those moments—which sometimes occur only at the interval\r\nof years—when a man’s moral aspect is faithfully revealed to his mind’s\r\neye. Not improbably he had never before viewed himself as he did now.\r\n\r\n“Hast thou not tortured him enough?” said Hester, noticing the old\r\nman’s look. “Has he not paid thee all?”\r\n\r\n“No, no! He has but increased the debt!” answered the physician, and as\r\nhe proceeded, his manner lost its fiercer characteristics, and subsided\r\ninto gloom. “Dost thou remember me, Hester, as I was nine years agone?\r\nEven then I was in the autumn of my days, nor was it the early autumn.\r\nBut all my life had been made up of earnest, studious, thoughtful,\r\nquiet years, bestowed faithfully for the increase of mine own\r\nknowledge, and faithfully, too, though this latter object was but\r\ncasual to the other—faithfully for the advancement of human welfare. No\r\nlife had been more peaceful and innocent than mine; few lives so rich\r\nwith benefits conferred. Dost thou remember me? Was I not, though you\r\nmight deem me cold, nevertheless a man thoughtful for others, craving\r\nlittle for himself—kind, true, just and of constant, if not warm\r\naffections? Was I not all this?”\r\n\r\n“All this, and more,” said Hester.\r\n\r\n“And what am I now?” demanded he, looking into her face, and permitting\r\nthe whole evil within him to be written on his features. “I have\r\nalready told thee what I am—a fiend! Who made me so?”\r\n\r\n“It was myself,” cried Hester, shuddering. “It was I, not less than he.\r\nWhy hast thou not avenged thyself on me?”\r\n\r\n“I have left thee to the scarlet letter,” replied Roger Chillingworth.\r\n“If that has not avenged me, I can do no more!”\r\n\r\nHe laid his finger on it with a smile.\r\n\r\n“It has avenged thee,” answered Hester Prynne.\r\n\r\n“I judged no less,” said the physician. “And now what wouldst thou with\r\nme touching this man?”\r\n\r\n“I must reveal the secret,” answered Hester, firmly. “He must discern\r\nthee in thy true character. What may be the result I know not. But this\r\nlong debt of confidence, due from me to him, whose bane and ruin I have\r\nbeen, shall at length be paid. So far as concerns the overthrow or\r\npreservation of his fair fame and his earthly state, and perchance his\r\nlife, he is in my hands. Nor do I—whom the scarlet letter has\r\ndisciplined to truth, though it be the truth of red-hot iron entering\r\ninto the soul—nor do I perceive such advantage in his living any longer\r\na life of ghastly emptiness, that I shall stoop to implore thy mercy.\r\nDo with him as thou wilt! There is no good for him, no good for me, no\r\ngood for thee. There is no good for little Pearl. There is no path to\r\nguide us out of this dismal maze.”\r\n\r\n“Woman, I could well-nigh pity thee,” said Roger Chillingworth, unable\r\nto restrain a thrill of admiration too, for there was a quality almost\r\nmajestic in the despair which she expressed. “Thou hadst great\r\nelements. Peradventure, hadst thou met earlier with a better love than\r\nmine, this evil had not been. I pity thee, for the good that has been\r\nwasted in thy nature.”\r\n\r\n“And I thee,” answered Hester Prynne, “for the hatred that has\r\ntransformed a wise and just man to a fiend! Wilt thou yet purge it out\r\nof thee, and be once more human? If not for his sake, then doubly for\r\nthine own! Forgive, and leave his further retribution to the Power that\r\nclaims it! I said, but now, that there could be no good event for him,\r\nor thee, or me, who are here wandering together in this gloomy maze of\r\nevil, and stumbling at every step over the guilt wherewith we have\r\nstrewn our path. It is not so! There might be good for thee, and thee\r\nalone, since thou hast been deeply wronged and hast it at thy will to\r\npardon. Wilt thou give up that only privilege? Wilt thou reject that\r\npriceless benefit?”\r\n\r\n“Peace, Hester—peace!” replied the old man, with gloomy sternness—“it\r\nis not granted me to pardon. I have no such power as thou tellest me\r\nof. My old faith, long forgotten, comes back to me, and explains all\r\nthat we do, and all we suffer. By thy first step awry, thou didst plant\r\nthe germ of evil; but since that moment it has all been a dark\r\nnecessity. Ye that have wronged me are not sinful, save in a kind of\r\ntypical illusion; neither am I fiend-like, who have snatched a fiend’s\r\noffice from his hands. It is our fate. Let the black flower blossom as\r\nit may! Now, go thy ways, and deal as thou wilt with yonder man.”\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand, and betook himself again to his employment of\r\ngathering herbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\nHESTER AND PEARL\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Roger Chillingworth—a deformed old figure with a face that haunted\r\nmen’s memories longer than they liked—took leave of Hester Prynne, and\r\nwent stooping away along the earth. He gathered here and there a herb,\r\nor grubbed up a root and put it into the basket on his arm. His gray\r\nbeard almost touched the ground as he crept onward. Hester gazed after\r\nhim a little while, looking with a half fantastic curiosity to see\r\nwhether the tender grass of early spring would not be blighted beneath\r\nhim and show the wavering track of his footsteps, sere and brown,\r\nacross its cheerful verdure. She wondered what sort of herbs they were\r\nwhich the old man was so sedulous to gather. Would not the earth,\r\nquickened to an evil purpose by the sympathy of his eye, greet him with\r\npoisonous shrubs of species hitherto unknown, that would start up under\r\nhis fingers? Or might it suffice him that every wholesome growth should\r\nbe converted into something deleterious and malignant at his touch? Did\r\nthe sun, which shone so brightly everywhere else, really fall upon him?\r\nOr was there, as it rather seemed, a circle of ominous shadow moving\r\nalong with his deformity whichever way he turned himself? And whither\r\nwas he now going? Would he not suddenly sink into the earth, leaving a\r\nbarren and blasted spot, where, in due course of time, would be seen\r\ndeadly nightshade, dogwood, henbane, and whatever else of vegetable\r\nwickedness the climate could produce, all flourishing with hideous\r\nluxuriance? Or would he spread bat’s wings and flee away, looking so\r\nmuch the uglier the higher he rose towards heaven?\r\n\r\n“Be it sin or no,” said Hester Prynne, bitterly, as still she gazed\r\nafter him, “I hate the man!”\r\n\r\nShe upbraided herself for the sentiment, but could not overcome or\r\nlessen it. Attempting to do so, she thought of those long-past days in\r\na distant land, when he used to emerge at eventide from the seclusion\r\nof his study and sit down in the firelight of their home, and in the\r\nlight of her nuptial smile. He needed to bask himself in that smile, he\r\nsaid, in order that the chill of so many lonely hours among his books\r\nmight be taken off the scholar’s heart. Such scenes had once appeared\r\nnot otherwise than happy, but now, as viewed through the dismal medium\r\nof her subsequent life, they classed themselves among her ugliest\r\nremembrances. She marvelled how such scenes could have been! She\r\nmarvelled how she could ever have been wrought upon to marry him! She\r\ndeemed it her crime most to be repented of, that she had ever endured\r\nand reciprocated the lukewarm grasp of his hand, and had suffered the\r\nsmile of her lips and eyes to mingle and melt into his own. And it\r\nseemed a fouler offence committed by Roger Chillingworth than any which\r\nhad since been done him, that, in the time when her heart knew no\r\nbetter, he had persuaded her to fancy herself happy by his side.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I hate him!” repeated Hester more bitterly than before. “He\r\nbetrayed me! He has done me worse wrong than I did him!”\r\n\r\nLet men tremble to win the hand of woman, unless they win along with it\r\nthe utmost passion of her heart! Else it may be their miserable\r\nfortune, as it was Roger Chillingworth’s, when some mightier touch than\r\ntheir own may have awakened all her sensibilities, to be reproached\r\neven for the calm content, the marble image of happiness, which they\r\nwill have imposed upon her as the warm reality. But Hester ought long\r\nago to have done with this injustice. What did it betoken? Had seven\r\nlong years, under the torture of the scarlet letter, inflicted so much\r\nof misery and wrought out no repentance?\r\n\r\nThe emotion of that brief space, while she stood gazing after the\r\ncrooked figure of old Roger Chillingworth, threw a dark light on\r\nHester’s state of mind, revealing much that she might not otherwise\r\nhave acknowledged to herself.\r\n\r\nHe being gone, she summoned back her child.\r\n\r\n“Pearl! Little Pearl! Where are you?”\r\n\r\nPearl, whose activity of spirit never flagged, had been at no loss for\r\namusement while her mother talked with the old gatherer of herbs. At\r\nfirst, as already told, she had flirted fancifully with her own image\r\nin a pool of water, beckoning the phantom forth, and—as it declined to\r\nventure—seeking a passage for herself into its sphere of impalpable\r\nearth and unattainable sky. Soon finding, however, that either she or\r\nthe image was unreal, she turned elsewhere for better pastime. She made\r\nlittle boats out of birch-bark, and freighted them with snailshells,\r\nand sent out more ventures on the mighty deep than any merchant in New\r\nEngland; but the larger part of them foundered near the shore. She\r\nseized a live horse-shoe by the tail, and made prize of several\r\nfive-fingers, and laid out a jelly-fish to melt in the warm sun. Then\r\nshe took up the white foam that streaked the line of the advancing\r\ntide, and threw it upon the breeze, scampering after it with winged\r\nfootsteps to catch the great snowflakes ere they fell. Perceiving a\r\nflock of beach-birds that fed and fluttered along the shore, the\r\nnaughty child picked up her apron full of pebbles, and, creeping from\r\nrock to rock after these small sea-fowl, displayed remarkable dexterity\r\nin pelting them. One little gray bird, with a white breast, Pearl was\r\nalmost sure had been hit by a pebble, and fluttered away with a broken\r\nwing. But then the elf-child sighed, and gave up her sport, because it\r\ngrieved her to have done harm to a little being that was as wild as the\r\nsea-breeze, or as wild as Pearl herself.\r\n\r\nHer final employment was to gather seaweed of various kinds, and make\r\nherself a scarf or mantle, and a head-dress, and thus assume the aspect\r\nof a little mermaid. She inherited her mother’s gift for devising\r\ndrapery and costume. As the last touch to her mermaid’s garb, Pearl\r\ntook some eel-grass and imitated, as best she could, on her own bosom\r\nthe decoration with which she was so familiar on her mother’s. A\r\nletter—the letter A—but freshly green instead of scarlet. The child\r\nbent her chin upon her breast, and contemplated this device with\r\nstrange interest, even as if the one only thing for which she had been\r\nsent into the world was to make out its hidden import.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if mother will ask me what it means?” thought Pearl.\r\n\r\nJust then she heard her mother’s voice, and, flitting along as lightly\r\nas one of the little sea-birds, appeared before Hester Prynne dancing,\r\nlaughing, and pointing her finger to the ornament upon her bosom.\r\n\r\n“My little Pearl,” said Hester, after a moment’s silence, “the green\r\nletter, and on thy childish bosom, has no purport. But dost thou know,\r\nmy child, what this letter means which thy mother is doomed to wear?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, mother,” said the child. “It is the great letter A. Thou hast\r\ntaught me in the horn-book.”\r\n\r\nHester looked steadily into her little face; but though there was that\r\nsingular expression which she had so often remarked in her black eyes,\r\nshe could not satisfy herself whether Pearl really attached any meaning\r\nto the symbol. She felt a morbid desire to ascertain the point.\r\n\r\n“Dost thou know, child, wherefore thy mother wears this letter?”\r\n\r\n“Truly do I!” answered Pearl, looking brightly into her mother’s face.\r\n“It is for the same reason that the minister keeps his hand over his\r\nheart!”\r\n\r\n“And what reason is that?” asked Hester, half smiling at the absurd\r\nincongruity of the child’s observation; but on second thoughts turning\r\npale.\r\n\r\n“What has the letter to do with any heart save mine?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, mother, I have told all I know,” said Pearl, more seriously than\r\nshe was wont to speak. “Ask yonder old man whom thou hast been talking\r\nwith,—it may be he can tell. But in good earnest now, mother dear, what\r\ndoes this scarlet letter mean?—and why dost thou wear it on thy\r\nbosom?—and why does the minister keep his hand over his heart?”\r\n\r\nShe took her mother’s hand in both her own, and gazed into her eyes\r\nwith an earnestness that was seldom seen in her wild and capricious\r\ncharacter. The thought occurred to Hester, that the child might really\r\nbe seeking to approach her with childlike confidence, and doing what\r\nshe could, and as intelligently as she knew how, to establish a\r\nmeeting-point of sympathy. It showed Pearl in an unwonted aspect.\r\nHeretofore, the mother, while loving her child with the intensity of a\r\nsole affection, had schooled herself to hope for little other return\r\nthan the waywardness of an April breeze, which spends its time in airy\r\nsport, and has its gusts of inexplicable passion, and is petulant in\r\nits best of moods, and chills oftener than caresses you, when you take\r\nit to your bosom; in requital of which misdemeanours it will sometimes,\r\nof its own vague purpose, kiss your cheek with a kind of doubtful\r\ntenderness, and play gently with your hair, and then be gone about its\r\nother idle business, leaving a dreamy pleasure at your heart. And this,\r\nmoreover, was a mother’s estimate of the child’s disposition. Any other\r\nobserver might have seen few but unamiable traits, and have given them\r\na far darker colouring. But now the idea came strongly into Hester’s\r\nmind, that Pearl, with her remarkable precocity and acuteness, might\r\nalready have approached the age when she could have been made a friend,\r\nand intrusted with as much of her mother’s sorrows as could be\r\nimparted, without irreverence either to the parent or the child. In the\r\nlittle chaos of Pearl’s character there might be seen emerging and\r\ncould have been from the very first—the steadfast principles of an\r\nunflinching courage—an uncontrollable will—sturdy pride, which might be\r\ndisciplined into self-respect—and a bitter scorn of many things which,\r\nwhen examined, might be found to have the taint of falsehood in them.\r\nShe possessed affections, too, though hitherto acrid and disagreeable,\r\nas are the richest flavours of unripe fruit. With all these sterling\r\nattributes, thought Hester, the evil which she inherited from her\r\nmother must be great indeed, if a noble woman do not grow out of this\r\nelfish child.\r\n\r\nPearl’s inevitable tendency to hover about the enigma of the scarlet\r\nletter seemed an innate quality of her being. From the earliest epoch\r\nof her conscious life, she had entered upon this as her appointed\r\nmission. Hester had often fancied that Providence had a design of\r\njustice and retribution, in endowing the child with this marked\r\npropensity; but never, until now, had she bethought herself to ask,\r\nwhether, linked with that design, there might not likewise be a purpose\r\nof mercy and beneficence. If little Pearl were entertained with faith\r\nand trust, as a spirit messenger no less than an earthly child, might\r\nit not be her errand to soothe away the sorrow that lay cold in her\r\nmother’s heart, and converted it into a tomb?—and to help her to\r\novercome the passion, once so wild, and even yet neither dead nor\r\nasleep, but only imprisoned within the same tomb-like heart?\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the thoughts that now stirred in Hester’s mind, with\r\nas much vivacity of impression as if they had actually been whispered\r\ninto her ear. And there was little Pearl, all this while, holding her\r\nmother’s hand in both her own, and turning her face upward, while she\r\nput these searching questions, once and again, and still a third time.\r\n\r\n“What does the letter mean, mother? and why dost thou wear it? and why\r\ndoes the minister keep his hand over his heart?”\r\n\r\n“What shall I say?” thought Hester to herself. “No! if this be the\r\nprice of the child’s sympathy, I cannot pay it.”\r\n\r\nThen she spoke aloud—\r\n\r\n“Silly Pearl,” said she, “what questions are these? There are many\r\nthings in this world that a child must not ask about. What know I of\r\nthe minister’s heart? And as for the scarlet letter, I wear it for the\r\nsake of its gold thread.”\r\n\r\nIn all the seven bygone years, Hester Prynne had never before been\r\nfalse to the symbol on her bosom. It may be that it was the talisman of\r\na stern and severe, but yet a guardian spirit, who now forsook her; as\r\nrecognising that, in spite of his strict watch over her heart, some new\r\nevil had crept into it, or some old one had never been expelled. As for\r\nlittle Pearl, the earnestness soon passed out of her face.\r\n\r\nBut the child did not see fit to let the matter drop. Two or three\r\ntimes, as her mother and she went homeward, and as often at\r\nsupper-time, and while Hester was putting her to bed, and once after\r\nshe seemed to be fairly asleep, Pearl looked up, with mischief gleaming\r\nin her black eyes.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” said she, “what does the scarlet letter mean?”\r\n\r\nAnd the next morning, the first indication the child gave of being\r\nawake was by popping up her head from the pillow, and making that other\r\nenquiry, which she had so unaccountably connected with her\r\ninvestigations about the scarlet letter—\r\n\r\n“Mother!—Mother!—Why does the minister keep his hand over his heart?”\r\n\r\n“Hold thy tongue, naughty child!” answered her mother, with an asperity\r\nthat she had never permitted to herself before. “Do not tease me; else\r\nI shall put thee into the dark closet!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\nA FOREST WALK\r\n\r\n\r\nHester Prynne remained constant in her resolve to make known to Mr.\r\nDimmesdale, at whatever risk of present pain or ulterior consequences,\r\nthe true character of the man who had crept into his intimacy. For\r\nseveral days, however, she vainly sought an opportunity of addressing\r\nhim in some of the meditative walks which she knew him to be in the\r\nhabit of taking along the shores of the Peninsula, or on the wooded\r\nhills of the neighbouring country. There would have been no scandal,\r\nindeed, nor peril to the holy whiteness of the clergyman’s good fame,\r\nhad she visited him in his own study, where many a penitent, ere now,\r\nhad confessed sins of perhaps as deep a dye as the one betokened by the\r\nscarlet letter. But, partly that she dreaded the secret or undisguised\r\ninterference of old Roger Chillingworth, and partly that her conscious\r\nheart imparted suspicion where none could have been felt, and partly\r\nthat both the minister and she would need the whole wide world to\r\nbreathe in, while they talked together—for all these reasons Hester\r\nnever thought of meeting him in any narrower privacy than beneath the\r\nopen sky.\r\n\r\nAt last, while attending a sick chamber, whither the Rev. Mr.\r\nDimmesdale had been summoned to make a prayer, she learnt that he had\r\ngone, the day before, to visit the Apostle Eliot, among his Indian\r\nconverts. He would probably return by a certain hour in the afternoon\r\nof the morrow. Betimes, therefore, the next day, Hester took little\r\nPearl—who was necessarily the companion of all her mother’s\r\nexpeditions, however inconvenient her presence—and set forth.\r\n\r\nThe road, after the two wayfarers had crossed from the Peninsula to the\r\nmainland, was no other than a footpath. It straggled onward into the\r\nmystery of the primeval forest. This hemmed it in so narrowly, and\r\nstood so black and dense on either side, and disclosed such imperfect\r\nglimpses of the sky above, that, to Hester’s mind, it imaged not amiss\r\nthe moral wilderness in which she had so long been wandering. The day\r\nwas chill and sombre. Overhead was a gray expanse of cloud, slightly\r\nstirred, however, by a breeze; so that a gleam of flickering sunshine\r\nmight now and then be seen at its solitary play along the path. This\r\nflitting cheerfulness was always at the further extremity of some long\r\nvista through the forest. The sportive sunlight—feebly sportive, at\r\nbest, in the predominant pensiveness of the day and scene—withdrew\r\nitself as they came nigh, and left the spots where it had danced the\r\ndrearier, because they had hoped to find them bright.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” said little Pearl, “the sunshine does not love you. It runs\r\naway and hides itself, because it is afraid of something on your bosom.\r\nNow, see! There it is, playing a good way off. Stand you here, and let\r\nme run and catch it. I am but a child. It will not flee from me—for I\r\nwear nothing on my bosom yet!”\r\n\r\n“Nor ever will, my child, I hope,” said Hester.\r\n\r\n“And why not, mother?” asked Pearl, stopping short, just at the\r\nbeginning of her race. “Will not it come of its own accord when I am a\r\nwoman grown?”\r\n\r\n“Run away, child,” answered her mother, “and catch the sunshine. It\r\nwill soon be gone.”\r\n\r\nPearl set forth at a great pace, and as Hester smiled to perceive, did\r\nactually catch the sunshine, and stood laughing in the midst of it, all\r\nbrightened by its splendour, and scintillating with the vivacity\r\nexcited by rapid motion. The light lingered about the lonely child, as\r\nif glad of such a playmate, until her mother had drawn almost nigh\r\nenough to step into the magic circle too.\r\n\r\n“It will go now,” said Pearl, shaking her head.\r\n\r\n“See!” answered Hester, smiling; “now I can stretch out my hand and\r\ngrasp some of it.”\r\n\r\nAs she attempted to do so, the sunshine vanished; or, to judge from the\r\nbright expression that was dancing on Pearl’s features, her mother\r\ncould have fancied that the child had absorbed it into herself, and\r\nwould give it forth again, with a gleam about her path, as they should\r\nplunge into some gloomier shade. There was no other attribute that so\r\nmuch impressed her with a sense of new and untransmitted vigour in\r\nPearl’s nature, as this never failing vivacity of spirits: she had not\r\nthe disease of sadness, which almost all children, in these latter\r\ndays, inherit, with the scrofula, from the troubles of their ancestors.\r\nPerhaps this, too, was a disease, and but the reflex of the wild energy\r\nwith which Hester had fought against her sorrows before Pearl’s birth.\r\nIt was certainly a doubtful charm, imparting a hard, metallic lustre to\r\nthe child’s character. She wanted—what some people want throughout\r\nlife—a grief that should deeply touch her, and thus humanise and make\r\nher capable of sympathy. But there was time enough yet for little\r\nPearl.\r\n\r\n“Come, my child!” said Hester, looking about her from the spot where\r\nPearl had stood still in the sunshine—“we will sit down a little way\r\nwithin the wood, and rest ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“I am not aweary, mother,” replied the little girl. “But you may sit\r\ndown, if you will tell me a story meanwhile.”\r\n\r\n“A story, child!” said Hester. “And about what?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, a story about the Black Man,” answered Pearl, taking hold of her\r\nmother’s gown, and looking up, half earnestly, half mischievously, into\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n“How he haunts this forest, and carries a book with him a big, heavy\r\nbook, with iron clasps; and how this ugly Black Man offers his book and\r\nan iron pen to everybody that meets him here among the trees; and they\r\nare to write their names with their own blood; and then he sets his\r\nmark on their bosoms. Didst thou ever meet the Black Man, mother?”\r\n\r\n“And who told you this story, Pearl,” asked her mother, recognising a\r\ncommon superstition of the period.\r\n\r\n“It was the old dame in the chimney corner, at the house where you\r\nwatched last night,” said the child. “But she fancied me asleep while\r\nshe was talking of it. She said that a thousand and a thousand people\r\nhad met him here, and had written in his book, and have his mark on\r\nthem. And that ugly tempered lady, old Mistress Hibbins, was one. And,\r\nmother, the old dame said that this scarlet letter was the Black Man’s\r\nmark on thee, and that it glows like a red flame when thou meetest him\r\nat midnight, here in the dark wood. Is it true, mother? And dost thou\r\ngo to meet him in the nighttime?”\r\n\r\n“Didst thou ever awake and find thy mother gone?” asked Hester.\r\n\r\n“Not that I remember,” said the child. “If thou fearest to leave me in\r\nour cottage, thou mightest take me along with thee. I would very gladly\r\ngo! But, mother, tell me now! Is there such a Black Man? And didst thou\r\never meet him? And is this his mark?”\r\n\r\n“Wilt thou let me be at peace, if I once tell thee?” asked her mother.\r\n\r\n“Yes, if thou tellest me all,” answered Pearl.\r\n\r\n“Once in my life I met the Black Man!” said her mother. “This scarlet\r\nletter is his mark!”\r\n\r\nThus conversing, they entered sufficiently deep into the wood to secure\r\nthemselves from the observation of any casual passenger along the\r\nforest track. Here they sat down on a luxuriant heap of moss; which at\r\nsome epoch of the preceding century, had been a gigantic pine, with its\r\nroots and trunk in the darksome shade, and its head aloft in the upper\r\natmosphere. It was a little dell where they had seated themselves, with\r\na leaf-strewn bank rising gently on either side, and a brook flowing\r\nthrough the midst, over a bed of fallen and drowned leaves. The trees\r\nimpending over it had flung down great branches from time to time,\r\nwhich choked up the current, and compelled it to form eddies and black\r\ndepths at some points; while, in its swifter and livelier passages\r\nthere appeared a channel-way of pebbles, and brown, sparkling sand.\r\nLetting the eyes follow along the course of the stream, they could\r\ncatch the reflected light from its water, at some short distance within\r\nthe forest, but soon lost all traces of it amid the bewilderment of\r\ntree-trunks and underbrush, and here and there a huge rock covered over\r\nwith gray lichens. All these giant trees and boulders of granite seemed\r\nintent on making a mystery of the course of this small brook; fearing,\r\nperhaps, that, with its never-ceasing loquacity, it should whisper\r\ntales out of the heart of the old forest whence it flowed, or mirror\r\nits revelations on the smooth surface of a pool. Continually, indeed,\r\nas it stole onward, the streamlet kept up a babble, kind, quiet,\r\nsoothing, but melancholy, like the voice of a young child that was\r\nspending its infancy without playfulness, and knew not how to be merry\r\namong sad acquaintance and events of sombre hue.\r\n\r\n“Oh, brook! Oh, foolish and tiresome little brook!” cried Pearl, after\r\nlistening awhile to its talk, “Why art thou so sad? Pluck up a spirit,\r\nand do not be all the time sighing and murmuring!”\r\n\r\nBut the brook, in the course of its little lifetime among the forest\r\ntrees, had gone through so solemn an experience that it could not help\r\ntalking about it, and seemed to have nothing else to say. Pearl\r\nresembled the brook, inasmuch as the current of her life gushed from a\r\nwell-spring as mysterious, and had flowed through scenes shadowed as\r\nheavily with gloom. But, unlike the little stream, she danced and\r\nsparkled, and prattled airily along her course.\r\n\r\n“What does this sad little brook say, mother?” inquired she.\r\n\r\n“If thou hadst a sorrow of thine own, the brook might tell thee of it,”\r\nanswered her mother, “even as it is telling me of mine. But now, Pearl,\r\nI hear a footstep along the path, and the noise of one putting aside\r\nthe branches. I would have thee betake thyself to play, and leave me to\r\nspeak with him that comes yonder.”\r\n\r\n“Is it the Black Man?” asked Pearl.\r\n\r\n“Wilt thou go and play, child?” repeated her mother, “But do not stray\r\nfar into the wood. And take heed that thou come at my first call.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, mother,” answered Pearl, “But if it be the Black Man, wilt thou\r\nnot let me stay a moment, and look at him, with his big book under his\r\narm?”\r\n\r\n“Go, silly child!” said her mother impatiently. “It is no Black Man!\r\nThou canst see him now, through the trees. It is the minister!”\r\n\r\n“And so it is!” said the child. “And, mother, he has his hand over his\r\nheart! Is it because, when the minister wrote his name in the book, the\r\nBlack Man set his mark in that place? But why does he not wear it\r\noutside his bosom, as thou dost, mother?”\r\n\r\n“Go now, child, and thou shalt tease me as thou wilt another time,”\r\ncried Hester Prynne. “But do not stray far. Keep where thou canst hear\r\nthe babble of the brook.”\r\n\r\nThe child went singing away, following up the current of the brook, and\r\nstriving to mingle a more lightsome cadence with its melancholy voice.\r\nBut the little stream would not be comforted, and still kept telling\r\nits unintelligible secret of some very mournful mystery that had\r\nhappened—or making a prophetic lamentation about something that was yet\r\nto happen—within the verge of the dismal forest. So Pearl, who had\r\nenough of shadow in her own little life, chose to break off all\r\nacquaintance with this repining brook. She set herself, therefore, to\r\ngathering violets and wood-anemones, and some scarlet columbines that\r\nshe found growing in the crevice of a high rock.\r\n\r\nWhen her elf-child had departed, Hester Prynne made a step or two\r\ntowards the track that led through the forest, but still remained under\r\nthe deep shadow of the trees. She beheld the minister advancing along\r\nthe path entirely alone, and leaning on a staff which he had cut by the\r\nwayside. He looked haggard and feeble, and betrayed a nerveless\r\ndespondency in his air, which had never so remarkably characterised him\r\nin his walks about the settlement, nor in any other situation where he\r\ndeemed himself liable to notice. Here it was wofully visible, in this\r\nintense seclusion of the forest, which of itself would have been a\r\nheavy trial to the spirits. There was a listlessness in his gait, as if\r\nhe saw no reason for taking one step further, nor felt any desire to do\r\nso, but would have been glad, could he be glad of anything, to fling\r\nhimself down at the root of the nearest tree, and lie there passive for\r\nevermore. The leaves might bestrew him, and the soil gradually\r\naccumulate and form a little hillock over his frame, no matter whether\r\nthere were life in it or no. Death was too definite an object to be\r\nwished for or avoided.\r\n\r\nTo Hester’s eye, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale exhibited no symptom of\r\npositive and vivacious suffering, except that, as little Pearl had\r\nremarked, he kept his hand over his heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\nTHE PASTOR AND HIS PARISHIONER\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly as the minister walked, he had almost gone by before Hester\r\nPrynne could gather voice enough to attract his observation. At length\r\nshe succeeded.\r\n\r\n“Arthur Dimmesdale!” she said, faintly at first, then louder, but\r\nhoarsely—“Arthur Dimmesdale!”\r\n\r\n“Who speaks?” answered the minister. Gathering himself quickly up, he\r\nstood more erect, like a man taken by surprise in a mood to which he\r\nwas reluctant to have witnesses. Throwing his eyes anxiously in the\r\ndirection of the voice, he indistinctly beheld a form under the trees,\r\nclad in garments so sombre, and so little relieved from the gray\r\ntwilight into which the clouded sky and the heavy foliage had darkened\r\nthe noontide, that he knew not whether it were a woman or a shadow. It\r\nmay be that his pathway through life was haunted thus by a spectre that\r\nhad stolen out from among his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe made a step nigher, and discovered the scarlet letter.\r\n\r\n“Hester! Hester Prynne!”, said he; “is it thou? Art thou in life?”\r\n\r\n“Even so.” she answered. “In such life as has been mine these seven\r\nyears past! And thou, Arthur Dimmesdale, dost thou yet live?”\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder that they thus questioned one another’s actual and\r\nbodily existence, and even doubted of their own. So strangely did they\r\nmeet in the dim wood that it was like the first encounter in the world\r\nbeyond the grave of two spirits who had been intimately connected in\r\ntheir former life, but now stood coldly shuddering in mutual dread, as\r\nnot yet familiar with their state, nor wonted to the companionship of\r\ndisembodied beings. Each a ghost, and awe-stricken at the other ghost.\r\nThey were awe-stricken likewise at themselves, because the crisis flung\r\nback to them their consciousness, and revealed to each heart its\r\nhistory and experience, as life never does, except at such breathless\r\nepochs. The soul beheld its features in the mirror of the passing\r\nmoment. It was with fear, and tremulously, and, as it were, by a slow,\r\nreluctant necessity, that Arthur Dimmesdale put forth his hand, chill\r\nas death, and touched the chill hand of Hester Prynne. The grasp, cold\r\nas it was, took away what was dreariest in the interview. They now felt\r\nthemselves, at least, inhabitants of the same sphere.\r\n\r\nWithout a word more spoken—neither he nor she assuming the guidance,\r\nbut with an unexpressed consent—they glided back into the shadow of the\r\nwoods whence Hester had emerged, and sat down on the heap of moss where\r\nshe and Pearl had before been sitting. When they found voice to speak,\r\nit was at first only to utter remarks and inquiries such as any two\r\nacquaintances might have made, about the gloomy sky, the threatening\r\nstorm, and, next, the health of each. Thus they went onward, not\r\nboldly, but step by step, into the themes that were brooding deepest in\r\ntheir hearts. So long estranged by fate and circumstances, they needed\r\nsomething slight and casual to run before and throw open the doors of\r\nintercourse, so that their real thoughts might be led across the\r\nthreshold.\r\n\r\nAfter awhile, the minister fixed his eyes on Hester Prynne’s.\r\n\r\n“Hester,” said he, “hast thou found peace?”\r\n\r\nShe smiled drearily, looking down upon her bosom.\r\n\r\n“Hast thou?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“None—nothing but despair!” he answered. “What else could I look for,\r\nbeing what I am, and leading such a life as mine? Were I an atheist—a\r\nman devoid of conscience—a wretch with coarse and brutal instincts—I\r\nmight have found peace long ere now. Nay, I never should have lost it.\r\nBut, as matters stand with my soul, whatever of good capacity there\r\noriginally was in me, all of God’s gifts that were the choicest have\r\nbecome the ministers of spiritual torment. Hester, I am most\r\nmiserable!”\r\n\r\n“The people reverence thee,” said Hester. “And surely thou workest good\r\namong them! Doth this bring thee no comfort?”\r\n\r\n“More misery, Hester!—Only the more misery!” answered the clergyman\r\nwith a bitter smile. “As concerns the good which I may appear to do, I\r\nhave no faith in it. It must needs be a delusion. What can a ruined\r\nsoul like mine effect towards the redemption of other souls?—or a\r\npolluted soul towards their purification? And as for the people’s\r\nreverence, would that it were turned to scorn and hatred! Canst thou\r\ndeem it, Hester, a consolation that I must stand up in my pulpit, and\r\nmeet so many eyes turned upward to my face, as if the light of heaven\r\nwere beaming from it!—must see my flock hungry for the truth, and\r\nlistening to my words as if a tongue of Pentecost were speaking!—and\r\nthen look inward, and discern the black reality of what they idolise? I\r\nhave laughed, in bitterness and agony of heart, at the contrast between\r\nwhat I seem and what I am! And Satan laughs at it!”\r\n\r\n“You wrong yourself in this,” said Hester gently. “You have deeply and\r\nsorely repented. Your sin is left behind you in the days long past.\r\nYour present life is not less holy, in very truth, than it seems in\r\npeople’s eyes. Is there no reality in the penitence thus sealed and\r\nwitnessed by good works? And wherefore should it not bring you peace?”\r\n\r\n“No, Hester—no!” replied the clergyman. “There is no substance in it!\r\nIt is cold and dead, and can do nothing for me! Of penance, I have had\r\nenough! Of penitence, there has been none! Else, I should long ago have\r\nthrown off these garments of mock holiness, and have shown myself to\r\nmankind as they will see me at the judgment-seat. Happy are you,\r\nHester, that wear the scarlet letter openly upon your bosom! Mine burns\r\nin secret! Thou little knowest what a relief it is, after the torment\r\nof a seven years’ cheat, to look into an eye that recognises me for\r\nwhat I am! Had I one friend—or were it my worst enemy!—to whom, when\r\nsickened with the praises of all other men, I could daily betake\r\nmyself, and be known as the vilest of all sinners, methinks my soul\r\nmight keep itself alive thereby. Even thus much of truth would save me!\r\nBut now, it is all falsehood!—all emptiness!—all death!”\r\n\r\nHester Prynne looked into his face, but hesitated to speak. Yet,\r\nuttering his long-restrained emotions so vehemently as he did, his\r\nwords here offered her the very point of circumstances in which to\r\ninterpose what she came to say. She conquered her fears, and spoke:\r\n\r\n“Such a friend as thou hast even now wished for,” said she, “with whom\r\nto weep over thy sin, thou hast in me, the partner of it!” Again she\r\nhesitated, but brought out the words with an effort.—“Thou hast long\r\nhad such an enemy, and dwellest with him, under the same roof!”\r\n\r\nThe minister started to his feet, gasping for breath, and clutching at\r\nhis heart, as if he would have torn it out of his bosom.\r\n\r\n“Ha! What sayest thou?” cried he. “An enemy! And under mine own roof!\r\nWhat mean you?”\r\n\r\nHester Prynne was now fully sensible of the deep injury for which she\r\nwas responsible to this unhappy man, in permitting him to lie for so\r\nmany years, or, indeed, for a single moment, at the mercy of one whose\r\npurposes could not be other than malevolent. The very contiguity of his\r\nenemy, beneath whatever mask the latter might conceal himself, was\r\nenough to disturb the magnetic sphere of a being so sensitive as Arthur\r\nDimmesdale. There had been a period when Hester was less alive to this\r\nconsideration; or, perhaps, in the misanthropy of her own trouble, she\r\nleft the minister to bear what she might picture to herself as a more\r\ntolerable doom. But of late, since the night of his vigil, all her\r\nsympathies towards him had been both softened and invigorated. She now\r\nread his heart more accurately. She doubted not that the continual\r\npresence of Roger Chillingworth—the secret poison of his malignity,\r\ninfecting all the air about him—and his authorised interference, as a\r\nphysician, with the minister’s physical and spiritual infirmities—that\r\nthese bad opportunities had been turned to a cruel purpose. By means of\r\nthem, the sufferer’s conscience had been kept in an irritated state,\r\nthe tendency of which was, not to cure by wholesome pain, but to\r\ndisorganize and corrupt his spiritual being. Its result, on earth,\r\ncould hardly fail to be insanity, and hereafter, that eternal\r\nalienation from the Good and True, of which madness is perhaps the\r\nearthly type.\r\n\r\nSuch was the ruin to which she had brought the man, once—nay, why\r\nshould we not speak it?—still so passionately loved! Hester felt that\r\nthe sacrifice of the clergyman’s good name, and death itself, as she\r\nhad already told Roger Chillingworth, would have been infinitely\r\npreferable to the alternative which she had taken upon herself to\r\nchoose. And now, rather than have had this grievous wrong to confess,\r\nshe would gladly have laid down on the forest leaves, and died there,\r\nat Arthur Dimmesdale’s feet.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Arthur!” cried she, “forgive me! In all things else, I have\r\nstriven to be true! Truth was the one virtue which I might have held\r\nfast, and did hold fast, through all extremity; save when thy good—thy\r\nlife—thy fame—were put in question! Then I consented to a deception.\r\nBut a lie is never good, even though death threaten on the other side!\r\nDost thou not see what I would say? That old man!—the physician!—he\r\nwhom they call Roger Chillingworth!—he was my husband!”\r\n\r\nThe minister looked at her for an instant, with all that violence of\r\npassion, which—intermixed in more shapes than one with his higher,\r\npurer, softer qualities—was, in fact, the portion of him which the\r\ndevil claimed, and through which he sought to win the rest. Never was\r\nthere a blacker or a fiercer frown than Hester now encountered. For the\r\nbrief space that it lasted, it was a dark transfiguration. But his\r\ncharacter had been so much enfeebled by suffering, that even its lower\r\nenergies were incapable of more than a temporary struggle. He sank down\r\non the ground, and buried his face in his hands.\r\n\r\n“I might have known it,” murmured he—“I did know it! Was not the secret\r\ntold me, in the natural recoil of my heart at the first sight of him,\r\nand as often as I have seen him since? Why did I not understand? Oh,\r\nHester Prynne, thou little, little knowest all the horror of this\r\nthing! And the shame!—the indelicacy!—the horrible ugliness of this\r\nexposure of a sick and guilty heart to the very eye that would gloat\r\nover it! Woman, woman, thou art accountable for this!—I cannot forgive\r\nthee!”\r\n\r\n“Thou shalt forgive me!” cried Hester, flinging herself on the fallen\r\nleaves beside him. “Let God punish! Thou shalt forgive!”\r\n\r\nWith sudden and desperate tenderness she threw her arms around him, and\r\npressed his head against her bosom, little caring though his cheek\r\nrested on the scarlet letter. He would have released himself, but\r\nstrove in vain to do so. Hester would not set him free, lest he should\r\nlook her sternly in the face. All the world had frowned on her—for\r\nseven long years had it frowned upon this lonely woman—and still she\r\nbore it all, nor ever once turned away her firm, sad eyes. Heaven,\r\nlikewise, had frowned upon her, and she had not died. But the frown of\r\nthis pale, weak, sinful, and sorrow-stricken man was what Hester could\r\nnot bear, and live!\r\n\r\n“Wilt thou yet forgive me?” she repeated, over and over again. “Wilt\r\nthou not frown? Wilt thou forgive?”\r\n\r\n“I do forgive you, Hester,” replied the minister at length, with a deep\r\nutterance, out of an abyss of sadness, but no anger. “I freely forgive\r\nyou now. May God forgive us both. We are not, Hester, the worst sinners\r\nin the world. There is one worse than even the polluted priest! That\r\nold man’s revenge has been blacker than my sin. He has violated, in\r\ncold blood, the sanctity of a human heart. Thou and I, Hester, never\r\ndid so!”\r\n\r\n“Never, never!” whispered she. “What we did had a consecration of its\r\nown. We felt it so! We said so to each other. Hast thou forgotten it?”\r\n\r\n“Hush, Hester!” said Arthur Dimmesdale, rising from the ground. “No; I\r\nhave not forgotten!”\r\n\r\nThey sat down again, side by side, and hand clasped in hand, on the\r\nmossy trunk of the fallen tree. Life had never brought them a gloomier\r\nhour; it was the point whither their pathway had so long been tending,\r\nand darkening ever, as it stole along—and yet it unclosed a charm that\r\nmade them linger upon it, and claim another, and another, and, after\r\nall, another moment. The forest was obscure around them, and creaked\r\nwith a blast that was passing through it. The boughs were tossing\r\nheavily above their heads; while one solemn old tree groaned dolefully\r\nto another, as if telling the sad story of the pair that sat beneath,\r\nor constrained to forbode evil to come.\r\n\r\nAnd yet they lingered. How dreary looked the forest-track that led\r\nbackward to the settlement, where Hester Prynne must take up again the\r\nburden of her ignominy and the minister the hollow mockery of his good\r\nname! So they lingered an instant longer. No golden light had ever been\r\nso precious as the gloom of this dark forest. Here seen only by his\r\neyes, the scarlet letter need not burn into the bosom of the fallen\r\nwoman! Here seen only by her eyes, Arthur Dimmesdale, false to God and\r\nman, might be, for one moment true!\r\n\r\nHe started at a thought that suddenly occurred to him.\r\n\r\n“Hester!” cried he, “here is a new horror! Roger Chillingworth knows\r\nyour purpose to reveal his true character. Will he continue, then, to\r\nkeep our secret? What will now be the course of his revenge?”\r\n\r\n“There is a strange secrecy in his nature,” replied Hester,\r\nthoughtfully; “and it has grown upon him by the hidden practices of his\r\nrevenge. I deem it not likely that he will betray the secret. He will\r\ndoubtless seek other means of satiating his dark passion.”\r\n\r\n“And I!—how am I to live longer, breathing the same air with this\r\ndeadly enemy?” exclaimed Arthur Dimmesdale, shrinking within himself,\r\nand pressing his hand nervously against his heart—a gesture that had\r\ngrown involuntary with him. “Think for me, Hester! Thou art strong.\r\nResolve for me!”\r\n\r\n“Thou must dwell no longer with this man,” said Hester, slowly and\r\nfirmly. “Thy heart must be no longer under his evil eye!”\r\n\r\n“It were far worse than death!” replied the minister. “But how to avoid\r\nit? What choice remains to me? Shall I lie down again on these withered\r\nleaves, where I cast myself when thou didst tell me what he was? Must I\r\nsink down there, and die at once?”\r\n\r\n“Alas! what a ruin has befallen thee!” said Hester, with the tears\r\ngushing into her eyes. “Wilt thou die for very weakness? There is no\r\nother cause!”\r\n\r\n“The judgment of God is on me,” answered the conscience-stricken\r\npriest. “It is too mighty for me to struggle with!”\r\n\r\n“Heaven would show mercy,” rejoined Hester, “hadst thou but the\r\nstrength to take advantage of it.”\r\n\r\n“Be thou strong for me!” answered he. “Advise me what to do.”\r\n\r\n“Is the world, then, so narrow?” exclaimed Hester Prynne, fixing her\r\ndeep eyes on the minister’s, and instinctively exercising a magnetic\r\npower over a spirit so shattered and subdued that it could hardly hold\r\nitself erect. “Doth the universe lie within the compass of yonder town,\r\nwhich only a little time ago was but a leaf-strewn desert, as lonely as\r\nthis around us? Whither leads yonder forest-track? Backward to the\r\nsettlement, thou sayest! Yes; but, onward, too! Deeper it goes, and\r\ndeeper into the wilderness, less plainly to be seen at every step;\r\nuntil some few miles hence the yellow leaves will show no vestige of\r\nthe white man’s tread. There thou art free! So brief a journey would\r\nbring thee from a world where thou hast been most wretched, to one\r\nwhere thou mayest still be happy! Is there not shade enough in all this\r\nboundless forest to hide thy heart from the gaze of Roger\r\nChillingworth?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Hester; but only under the fallen leaves!” replied the minister,\r\nwith a sad smile.\r\n\r\n“Then there is the broad pathway of the sea!” continued Hester. “It\r\nbrought thee hither. If thou so choose, it will bear thee back again.\r\nIn our native land, whether in some remote rural village, or in vast\r\nLondon—or, surely, in Germany, in France, in pleasant Italy—thou\r\nwouldst be beyond his power and knowledge! And what hast thou to do\r\nwith all these iron men, and their opinions? They have kept thy better\r\npart in bondage too long already!”\r\n\r\n“It cannot be!” answered the minister, listening as if he were called\r\nupon to realise a dream. “I am powerless to go. Wretched and sinful as\r\nI am, I have had no other thought than to drag on my earthly existence\r\nin the sphere where Providence hath placed me. Lost as my own soul is,\r\nI would still do what I may for other human souls! I dare not quit my\r\npost, though an unfaithful sentinel, whose sure reward is death and\r\ndishonour, when his dreary watch shall come to an end!”\r\n\r\n“Thou art crushed under this seven years’ weight of misery,” replied\r\nHester, fervently resolved to buoy him up with her own energy. “But\r\nthou shalt leave it all behind thee! It shall not cumber thy steps, as\r\nthou treadest along the forest-path: neither shalt thou freight the\r\nship with it, if thou prefer to cross the sea. Leave this wreck and\r\nruin here where it hath happened. Meddle no more with it! Begin all\r\nanew! Hast thou exhausted possibility in the failure of this one trial?\r\nNot so! The future is yet full of trial and success. There is happiness\r\nto be enjoyed! There is good to be done! Exchange this false life of\r\nthine for a true one. Be, if thy spirit summon thee to such a mission,\r\nthe teacher and apostle of the red men. Or, as is more thy nature, be a\r\nscholar and a sage among the wisest and the most renowned of the\r\ncultivated world. Preach! Write! Act! Do anything, save to lie down and\r\ndie! Give up this name of Arthur Dimmesdale, and make thyself another,\r\nand a high one, such as thou canst wear without fear or shame. Why\r\nshouldst thou tarry so much as one other day in the torments that have\r\nso gnawed into thy life? that have made thee feeble to will and to do?\r\nthat will leave thee powerless even to repent? Up, and away!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Hester!” cried Arthur Dimmesdale, in whose eyes a fitful light,\r\nkindled by her enthusiasm, flashed up and died away, “thou tellest of\r\nrunning a race to a man whose knees are tottering beneath him! I must\r\ndie here! There is not the strength or courage left me to venture into\r\nthe wide, strange, difficult world alone!”\r\n\r\nIt was the last expression of the despondency of a broken spirit. He\r\nlacked energy to grasp the better fortune that seemed within his reach.\r\n\r\nHe repeated the word—“Alone, Hester!”\r\n\r\n“Thou shall not go alone!” answered she, in a deep whisper. Then, all\r\nwas spoken!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\nA FLOOD OF SUNSHINE\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur Dimmesdale gazed into Hester’s face with a look in which hope\r\nand joy shone out, indeed, but with fear betwixt them, and a kind of\r\nhorror at her boldness, who had spoken what he vaguely hinted at, but\r\ndared not speak.\r\n\r\nBut Hester Prynne, with a mind of native courage and activity, and for\r\nso long a period not merely estranged, but outlawed from society, had\r\nhabituated herself to such latitude of speculation as was altogether\r\nforeign to the clergyman. She had wandered, without rule or guidance,\r\nin a moral wilderness, as vast, as intricate, and shadowy as the\r\nuntamed forest, amid the gloom of which they were now holding a\r\ncolloquy that was to decide their fate. Her intellect and heart had\r\ntheir home, as it were, in desert places, where she roamed as freely as\r\nthe wild Indian in his woods. For years past she had looked from this\r\nestranged point of view at human institutions, and whatever priests or\r\nlegislators had established; criticising all with hardly more reverence\r\nthan the Indian would feel for the clerical band, the judicial robe,\r\nthe pillory, the gallows, the fireside, or the church. The tendency of\r\nher fate and fortunes had been to set her free. The scarlet letter was\r\nher passport into regions where other women dared not tread. Shame,\r\nDespair, Solitude! These had been her teachers—stern and wild ones—and\r\nthey had made her strong, but taught her much amiss.\r\n\r\nThe minister, on the other hand, had never gone through an experience\r\ncalculated to lead him beyond the scope of generally received laws;\r\nalthough, in a single instance, he had so fearfully transgressed one of\r\nthe most sacred of them. But this had been a sin of passion, not of\r\nprinciple, nor even purpose. Since that wretched epoch, he had watched\r\nwith morbid zeal and minuteness, not his acts—for those it was easy to\r\narrange—but each breath of emotion, and his every thought. At the head\r\nof the social system, as the clergymen of that day stood, he was only\r\nthe more trammelled by its regulations, its principles, and even its\r\nprejudices. As a priest, the framework of his order inevitably hemmed\r\nhim in. As a man who had once sinned, but who kept his conscience all\r\nalive and painfully sensitive by the fretting of an unhealed wound, he\r\nmight have been supposed safer within the line of virtue than if he had\r\nnever sinned at all.\r\n\r\nThus we seem to see that, as regarded Hester Prynne, the whole seven\r\nyears of outlaw and ignominy had been little other than a preparation\r\nfor this very hour. But Arthur Dimmesdale! Were such a man once more to\r\nfall, what plea could be urged in extenuation of his crime? None;\r\nunless it avail him somewhat that he was broken down by long and\r\nexquisite suffering; that his mind was darkened and confused by the\r\nvery remorse which harrowed it; that, between fleeing as an avowed\r\ncriminal, and remaining as a hypocrite, conscience might find it hard\r\nto strike the balance; that it was human to avoid the peril of death\r\nand infamy, and the inscrutable machinations of an enemy; that,\r\nfinally, to this poor pilgrim, on his dreary and desert path, faint,\r\nsick, miserable, there appeared a glimpse of human affection and\r\nsympathy, a new life, and a true one, in exchange for the heavy doom\r\nwhich he was now expiating. And be the stern and sad truth spoken, that\r\nthe breach which guilt has once made into the human soul is never, in\r\nthis mortal state, repaired. It may be watched and guarded, so that the\r\nenemy shall not force his way again into the citadel, and might even in\r\nhis subsequent assaults, select some other avenue, in preference to\r\nthat where he had formerly succeeded. But there is still the ruined\r\nwall, and near it the stealthy tread of the foe that would win over\r\nagain his unforgotten triumph.\r\n\r\nThe struggle, if there were one, need not be described. Let it suffice\r\nthat the clergyman resolved to flee, and not alone.\r\n\r\n“If in all these past seven years,” thought he, “I could recall one\r\ninstant of peace or hope, I would yet endure, for the sake of that\r\nearnest of Heaven’s mercy. But now—since I am irrevocably\r\ndoomed—wherefore should I not snatch the solace allowed to the\r\ncondemned culprit before his execution? Or, if this be the path to a\r\nbetter life, as Hester would persuade me, I surely give up no fairer\r\nprospect by pursuing it! Neither can I any longer live without her\r\ncompanionship; so powerful is she to sustain—so tender to soothe! O\r\nThou to whom I dare not lift mine eyes, wilt Thou yet pardon me?”\r\n\r\n“Thou wilt go!” said Hester calmly, as he met her glance.\r\n\r\nThe decision once made, a glow of strange enjoyment threw its\r\nflickering brightness over the trouble of his breast. It was the\r\nexhilarating effect—upon a prisoner just escaped from the dungeon of\r\nhis own heart—of breathing the wild, free atmosphere of an unredeemed,\r\nunchristianised, lawless region. His spirit rose, as it were, with a\r\nbound, and attained a nearer prospect of the sky, than throughout all\r\nthe misery which had kept him grovelling on the earth. Of a deeply\r\nreligious temperament, there was inevitably a tinge of the devotional\r\nin his mood.\r\n\r\n“Do I feel joy again?” cried he, wondering at himself. “Methought the\r\ngerm of it was dead in me! Oh, Hester, thou art my better angel! I seem\r\nto have flung myself—sick, sin-stained, and sorrow-blackened—down upon\r\nthese forest leaves, and to have risen up all made anew, and with new\r\npowers to glorify Him that hath been merciful! This is already the\r\nbetter life! Why did we not find it sooner?”\r\n\r\n“Let us not look back,” answered Hester Prynne. “The past is gone!\r\nWherefore should we linger upon it now? See! With this symbol I undo it\r\nall, and make it as if it had never been!”\r\n\r\nSo speaking, she undid the clasp that fastened the scarlet letter, and,\r\ntaking it from her bosom, threw it to a distance among the withered\r\nleaves. The mystic token alighted on the hither verge of the stream.\r\nWith a hand’s-breadth further flight, it would have fallen into the\r\nwater, and have given the little brook another woe to carry onward,\r\nbesides the unintelligible tale which it still kept murmuring about.\r\nBut there lay the embroidered letter, glittering like a lost jewel,\r\nwhich some ill-fated wanderer might pick up, and thenceforth be haunted\r\nby strange phantoms of guilt, sinkings of the heart, and unaccountable\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\nThe stigma gone, Hester heaved a long, deep sigh, in which the burden\r\nof shame and anguish departed from her spirit. O exquisite relief! She\r\nhad not known the weight until she felt the freedom! By another\r\nimpulse, she took off the formal cap that confined her hair, and down\r\nit fell upon her shoulders, dark and rich, with at once a shadow and a\r\nlight in its abundance, and imparting the charm of softness to her\r\nfeatures. There played around her mouth, and beamed out of her eyes, a\r\nradiant and tender smile, that seemed gushing from the very heart of\r\nwomanhood. A crimson flush was glowing on her cheek, that had been long\r\nso pale. Her sex, her youth, and the whole richness of her beauty, came\r\nback from what men call the irrevocable past, and clustered themselves\r\nwith her maiden hope, and a happiness before unknown, within the magic\r\ncircle of this hour. And, as if the gloom of the earth and sky had been\r\nbut the effluence of these two mortal hearts, it vanished with their\r\nsorrow. All at once, as with a sudden smile of heaven, forth burst the\r\nsunshine, pouring a very flood into the obscure forest, gladdening each\r\ngreen leaf, transmuting the yellow fallen ones to gold, and gleaming\r\nadown the gray trunks of the solemn trees. The objects that had made a\r\nshadow hitherto, embodied the brightness now. The course of the little\r\nbrook might be traced by its merry gleam afar into the wood’s heart of\r\nmystery, which had become a mystery of joy.\r\n\r\nSuch was the sympathy of Nature—that wild, heathen Nature of the\r\nforest, never subjugated by human law, nor illumined by higher\r\ntruth—with the bliss of these two spirits! Love, whether newly-born, or\r\naroused from a death-like slumber, must always create a sunshine,\r\nfilling the heart so full of radiance, that it overflows upon the\r\noutward world. Had the forest still kept its gloom, it would have been\r\nbright in Hester’s eyes, and bright in Arthur Dimmesdale’s!\r\n\r\nHester looked at him with a thrill of another joy.\r\n\r\n“Thou must know Pearl!” said she. “Our little Pearl! Thou hast seen\r\nher—yes, I know it!—but thou wilt see her now with other eyes. She is a\r\nstrange child! I hardly comprehend her! But thou wilt love her dearly,\r\nas I do, and wilt advise me how to deal with her!”\r\n\r\n“Dost thou think the child will be glad to know me?” asked the\r\nminister, somewhat uneasily. “I have long shrunk from children, because\r\nthey often show a distrust—a backwardness to be familiar with me. I\r\nhave even been afraid of little Pearl!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that was sad!” answered the mother. “But she will love thee\r\ndearly, and thou her. She is not far off. I will call her. Pearl!\r\nPearl!”\r\n\r\n“I see the child,” observed the minister. “Yonder she is, standing in a\r\nstreak of sunshine, a good way off, on the other side of the brook. So\r\nthou thinkest the child will love me?”\r\n\r\nHester smiled, and again called to Pearl, who was visible at some\r\ndistance, as the minister had described her, like a bright-apparelled\r\nvision in a sunbeam, which fell down upon her through an arch of\r\nboughs. The ray quivered to and fro, making her figure dim or\r\ndistinct—now like a real child, now like a child’s spirit—as the\r\nsplendour went and came again. She heard her mother’s voice, and\r\napproached slowly through the forest.\r\n\r\nPearl had not found the hour pass wearisomely while her mother sat\r\ntalking with the clergyman. The great black forest—stern as it showed\r\nitself to those who brought the guilt and troubles of the world into\r\nits bosom—became the playmate of the lonely infant, as well as it knew\r\nhow. Sombre as it was, it put on the kindest of its moods to welcome\r\nher. It offered her the partridge-berries, the growth of the preceding\r\nautumn, but ripening only in the spring, and now red as drops of blood\r\nupon the withered leaves. These Pearl gathered, and was pleased with\r\ntheir wild flavour. The small denizens of the wilderness hardly took\r\npains to move out of her path. A partridge, indeed, with a brood of ten\r\nbehind her, ran forward threateningly, but soon repented of her\r\nfierceness, and clucked to her young ones not to be afraid. A pigeon,\r\nalone on a low branch, allowed Pearl to come beneath, and uttered a\r\nsound as much of greeting as alarm. A squirrel, from the lofty depths\r\nof his domestic tree, chattered either in anger or merriment—for the\r\nsquirrel is such a choleric and humorous little personage, that it is\r\nhard to distinguish between his moods—so he chattered at the child, and\r\nflung down a nut upon her head. It was a last year’s nut, and already\r\ngnawed by his sharp tooth. A fox, startled from his sleep by her light\r\nfootstep on the leaves, looked inquisitively at Pearl, as doubting\r\nwhether it were better to steal off, or renew his nap on the same spot.\r\nA wolf, it is said—but here the tale has surely lapsed into the\r\nimprobable—came up and smelt of Pearl’s robe, and offered his savage\r\nhead to be patted by her hand. The truth seems to be, however, that the\r\nmother-forest, and these wild things which it nourished, all recognised\r\na kindred wilderness in the human child.\r\n\r\nAnd she was gentler here than in the grassy-margined streets of the\r\nsettlement, or in her mother’s cottage. The flowers appeared to know it,\r\nand one and another whispered as she passed, “Adorn thyself with me,\r\nthou beautiful child, adorn thyself with me!”—and, to please them,\r\nPearl gathered the violets, and anemones, and columbines, and some\r\ntwigs of the freshest green, which the old trees held down before her\r\neyes. With these she decorated her hair and her young waist, and became\r\na nymph child, or an infant dryad, or whatever else was in closest\r\nsympathy with the antique wood. In such guise had Pearl adorned\r\nherself, when she heard her mother’s voice, and came slowly back.\r\n\r\nSlowly—for she saw the clergyman!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\nTHE CHILD AT THE BROOKSIDE\r\n\r\n\r\n“Thou wilt love her dearly,” repeated Hester Prynne, as she and the\r\nminister sat watching little Pearl. “Dost thou not think her beautiful?\r\nAnd see with what natural skill she has made those simple flowers adorn\r\nher! Had she gathered pearls, and diamonds, and rubies in the wood,\r\nthey could not have become her better! She is a splendid child! But I\r\nknow whose brow she has!”\r\n\r\n“Dost thou know, Hester,” said Arthur Dimmesdale, with an unquiet\r\nsmile, “that this dear child, tripping about always at thy side, hath\r\ncaused me many an alarm? Methought—oh, Hester, what a thought is that,\r\nand how terrible to dread it!—that my own features were partly repeated\r\nin her face, and so strikingly that the world might see them! But she\r\nis mostly thine!”\r\n\r\n“No, no! Not mostly!” answered the mother, with a tender smile. “A\r\nlittle longer, and thou needest not to be afraid to trace whose child\r\nshe is. But how strangely beautiful she looks with those wild flowers\r\nin her hair! It is as if one of the fairies, whom we left in dear old\r\nEngland, had decked her out to meet us.”\r\n\r\nIt was with a feeling which neither of them had ever before\r\nexperienced, that they sat and watched Pearl’s slow advance. In her was\r\nvisible the tie that united them. She had been offered to the world,\r\nthese seven past years, as the living hieroglyphic, in which was\r\nrevealed the secret they so darkly sought to hide—all written in this\r\nsymbol—all plainly manifest—had there been a prophet or magician\r\nskilled to read the character of flame! And Pearl was the oneness of\r\ntheir being. Be the foregone evil what it might, how could they doubt\r\nthat their earthly lives and future destinies were conjoined when they\r\nbeheld at once the material union, and the spiritual idea, in whom they\r\nmet, and were to dwell immortally together; thoughts like these—and\r\nperhaps other thoughts, which they did not acknowledge or define—threw\r\nan awe about the child as she came onward.\r\n\r\n“Let her see nothing strange—no passion or eagerness—in thy way of\r\naccosting her,” whispered Hester. “Our Pearl is a fitful and fantastic\r\nlittle elf sometimes. Especially she is generally intolerant of\r\nemotion, when she does not fully comprehend the why and wherefore. But\r\nthe child hath strong affections! She loves me, and will love thee!”\r\n\r\n“Thou canst not think,” said the minister, glancing aside at Hester\r\nPrynne, “how my heart dreads this interview, and yearns for it! But, in\r\ntruth, as I already told thee, children are not readily won to be\r\nfamiliar with me. They will not climb my knee, nor prattle in my ear,\r\nnor answer to my smile, but stand apart, and eye me strangely. Even\r\nlittle babes, when I take them in my arms, weep bitterly. Yet Pearl,\r\ntwice in her little lifetime, hath been kind to me! The first time—thou\r\nknowest it well! The last was when thou ledst her with thee to the\r\nhouse of yonder stern old Governor.”\r\n\r\n“And thou didst plead so bravely in her behalf and mine!” answered the\r\nmother. “I remember it; and so shall little Pearl. Fear nothing. She\r\nmay be strange and shy at first, but will soon learn to love thee!”\r\n\r\nBy this time Pearl had reached the margin of the brook, and stood on\r\nthe further side, gazing silently at Hester and the clergyman, who\r\nstill sat together on the mossy tree-trunk waiting to receive her. Just\r\nwhere she had paused, the brook chanced to form a pool so smooth and\r\nquiet that it reflected a perfect image of her little figure, with all\r\nthe brilliant picturesqueness of her beauty, in its adornment of\r\nflowers and wreathed foliage, but more refined and spiritualized than\r\nthe reality. This image, so nearly identical with the living Pearl,\r\nseemed to communicate somewhat of its own shadowy and intangible\r\nquality to the child herself. It was strange, the way in which Pearl\r\nstood, looking so steadfastly at them through the dim medium of the\r\nforest gloom, herself, meanwhile, all glorified with a ray of sunshine,\r\nthat was attracted thitherward as by a certain sympathy. In the brook\r\nbeneath stood another child—another and the same—with likewise its ray\r\nof golden light. Hester felt herself, in some indistinct and\r\ntantalizing manner, estranged from Pearl, as if the child, in her\r\nlonely ramble through the forest, had strayed out of the sphere in\r\nwhich she and her mother dwelt together, and was now vainly seeking to\r\nreturn to it.\r\n\r\nThere were both truth and error in the impression; the child and mother\r\nwere estranged, but through Hester’s fault, not Pearl’s. Since the\r\nlatter rambled from her side, another inmate had been admitted within\r\nthe circle of the mother’s feelings, and so modified the aspect of them\r\nall, that Pearl, the returning wanderer, could not find her wonted\r\nplace, and hardly knew where she was.\r\n\r\n“I have a strange fancy,” observed the sensitive minister, “that this\r\nbrook is the boundary between two worlds, and that thou canst never\r\nmeet thy Pearl again. Or is she an elfish spirit, who, as the legends\r\nof our childhood taught us, is forbidden to cross a running stream?\r\nPray hasten her, for this delay has already imparted a tremor to my\r\nnerves.”\r\n\r\n“Come, dearest child!” said Hester encouragingly, and stretching out\r\nboth her arms. “How slow thou art! When hast thou been so sluggish\r\nbefore now? Here is a friend of mine, who must be thy friend also. Thou\r\nwilt have twice as much love henceforward as thy mother alone could\r\ngive thee! Leap across the brook and come to us. Thou canst leap like a\r\nyoung deer!”\r\n\r\nPearl, without responding in any manner to these honey-sweet\r\nexpressions, remained on the other side of the brook. Now she fixed her\r\nbright wild eyes on her mother, now on the minister, and now included\r\nthem both in the same glance, as if to detect and explain to herself\r\nthe relation which they bore to one another. For some unaccountable\r\nreason, as Arthur Dimmesdale felt the child’s eyes upon himself, his\r\nhand—with that gesture so habitual as to have become involuntary—stole\r\nover his heart. At length, assuming a singular air of authority, Pearl\r\nstretched out her hand, with the small forefinger extended, and\r\npointing evidently towards her mother’s breast. And beneath, in the\r\nmirror of the brook, there was the flower-girdled and sunny image of\r\nlittle Pearl, pointing her small forefinger too.\r\n\r\n“Thou strange child! why dost thou not come to me?” exclaimed Hester.\r\n\r\nPearl still pointed with her forefinger, and a frown gathered on her\r\nbrow—the more impressive from the childish, the almost baby-like aspect\r\nof the features that conveyed it. As her mother still kept beckoning to\r\nher, and arraying her face in a holiday suit of unaccustomed smiles,\r\nthe child stamped her foot with a yet more imperious look and gesture.\r\nIn the brook, again, was the fantastic beauty of the image, with its\r\nreflected frown, its pointed finger, and imperious gesture, giving\r\nemphasis to the aspect of little Pearl.\r\n\r\n“Hasten, Pearl, or I shall be angry with thee!” cried Hester Prynne,\r\nwho, however, inured to such behaviour on the elf-child’s part at other\r\nseasons, was naturally anxious for a more seemly deportment now. “Leap\r\nacross the brook, naughty child, and run hither! Else I must come to\r\nthee!”\r\n\r\nBut Pearl, not a whit startled at her mother’s threats any more than\r\nmollified by her entreaties, now suddenly burst into a fit of passion,\r\ngesticulating violently, and throwing her small figure into the most\r\nextravagant contortions. She accompanied this wild outbreak with\r\npiercing shrieks, which the woods reverberated on all sides, so that,\r\nalone as she was in her childish and unreasonable wrath, it seemed as\r\nif a hidden multitude were lending her their sympathy and\r\nencouragement. Seen in the brook once more was the shadowy wrath of\r\nPearl’s image, crowned and girdled with flowers, but stamping its foot,\r\nwildly gesticulating, and, in the midst of all, still pointing its\r\nsmall forefinger at Hester’s bosom.\r\n\r\n“I see what ails the child,” whispered Hester to the clergyman, and\r\nturning pale in spite of a strong effort to conceal her trouble and\r\nannoyance, “Children will not abide any, the slightest, change in the\r\naccustomed aspect of things that are daily before their eyes. Pearl\r\nmisses something that she has always seen me wear!”\r\n\r\n“I pray you,” answered the minister, “if thou hast any means of\r\npacifying the child, do it forthwith! Save it were the cankered wrath\r\nof an old witch like Mistress Hibbins,” added he, attempting to smile,\r\n“I know nothing that I would not sooner encounter than this passion in\r\na child. In Pearl’s young beauty, as in the wrinkled witch, it has a\r\npreternatural effect. Pacify her if thou lovest me!”\r\n\r\nHester turned again towards Pearl with a crimson blush upon her cheek,\r\na conscious glance aside at the clergyman, and then a heavy sigh,\r\nwhile, even before she had time to speak, the blush yielded to a deadly\r\npallor.\r\n\r\n“Pearl,” said she sadly, “look down at thy feet! There!—before thee!—on\r\nthe hither side of the brook!”\r\n\r\nThe child turned her eyes to the point indicated, and there lay the\r\nscarlet letter so close upon the margin of the stream that the gold\r\nembroidery was reflected in it.\r\n\r\n“Bring it hither!” said Hester.\r\n\r\n“Come thou and take it up!” answered Pearl.\r\n\r\n“Was ever such a child!” observed Hester aside to the minister. “Oh, I\r\nhave much to tell thee about her! But, in very truth, she is right as\r\nregards this hateful token. I must bear its torture yet a little\r\nlonger—only a few days longer—until we shall have left this region, and\r\nlook back hither as to a land which we have dreamed of. The forest\r\ncannot hide it! The mid-ocean shall take it from my hand, and swallow\r\nit up for ever!”\r\n\r\nWith these words she advanced to the margin of the brook, took up the\r\nscarlet letter, and fastened it again into her bosom. Hopefully, but a\r\nmoment ago, as Hester had spoken of drowning it in the deep sea, there\r\nwas a sense of inevitable doom upon her as she thus received back this\r\ndeadly symbol from the hand of fate. She had flung it into infinite\r\nspace! she had drawn an hour’s free breath! and here again was the\r\nscarlet misery glittering on the old spot! So it ever is, whether thus\r\ntypified or no, that an evil deed invests itself with the character of\r\ndoom. Hester next gathered up the heavy tresses of her hair and\r\nconfined them beneath her cap. As if there were a withering spell in\r\nthe sad letter, her beauty, the warmth and richness of her womanhood,\r\ndeparted like fading sunshine, and a gray shadow seemed to fall across\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWhen the dreary change was wrought, she extended her hand to Pearl.\r\n\r\n“Dost thou know thy mother now, child?”, asked she, reproachfully, but\r\nwith a subdued tone. “Wilt thou come across the brook, and own thy\r\nmother, now that she has her shame upon her—now that she is sad?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; now I will!” answered the child, bounding across the brook, and\r\nclasping Hester in her arms “Now thou art my mother indeed! and I am\r\nthy little Pearl!”\r\n\r\nIn a mood of tenderness that was not usual with her, she drew down her\r\nmother’s head, and kissed her brow and both her cheeks. But then—by a\r\nkind of necessity that always impelled this child to alloy whatever\r\ncomfort she might chance to give with a throb of anguish—Pearl put up\r\nher mouth and kissed the scarlet letter, too.\r\n\r\n“That was not kind!” said Hester. “When thou hast shown me a little\r\nlove, thou mockest me!”\r\n\r\n“Why doth the minister sit yonder?” asked Pearl.\r\n\r\n“He waits to welcome thee,” replied her mother. “Come thou, and entreat\r\nhis blessing! He loves thee, my little Pearl, and loves thy mother,\r\ntoo. Wilt thou not love him? Come he longs to greet thee!”\r\n\r\n“Doth he love us?” said Pearl, looking up with acute intelligence into\r\nher mother’s face. “Will he go back with us, hand in hand, we three\r\ntogether, into the town?”\r\n\r\n“Not now, my child,” answered Hester. “But in days to come he will walk\r\nhand in hand with us. We will have a home and fireside of our own; and\r\nthou shalt sit upon his knee; and he will teach thee many things, and\r\nlove thee dearly. Thou wilt love him—wilt thou not?”\r\n\r\n“And will he always keep his hand over his heart?” inquired Pearl.\r\n\r\n“Foolish child, what a question is that!” exclaimed her mother. “Come,\r\nand ask his blessing!”\r\n\r\nBut, whether influenced by the jealousy that seems instinctive with\r\nevery petted child towards a dangerous rival, or from whatever caprice\r\nof her freakish nature, Pearl would show no favour to the clergyman. It\r\nwas only by an exertion of force that her mother brought her up to him,\r\nhanging back, and manifesting her reluctance by odd grimaces; of which,\r\never since her babyhood, she had possessed a singular variety, and\r\ncould transform her mobile physiognomy into a series of different\r\naspects, with a new mischief in them, each and all. The\r\nminister—painfully embarrassed, but hoping that a kiss might prove a\r\ntalisman to admit him into the child’s kindlier regards—bent forward,\r\nand impressed one on her brow. Hereupon, Pearl broke away from her\r\nmother, and, running to the brook, stooped over it, and bathed her\r\nforehead, until the unwelcome kiss was quite washed off and diffused\r\nthrough a long lapse of the gliding water. She then remained apart,\r\nsilently watching Hester and the clergyman; while they talked together\r\nand made such arrangements as were suggested by their new position and\r\nthe purposes soon to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAnd now this fateful interview had come to a close. The dell was to be\r\nleft in solitude among its dark, old trees, which, with their\r\nmultitudinous tongues, would whisper long of what had passed there, and\r\nno mortal be the wiser. And the melancholy brook would add this other\r\ntale to the mystery with which its little heart was already\r\noverburdened, and whereof it still kept up a murmuring babble, with not\r\na whit more cheerfulness of tone than for ages heretofore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\nTHE MINISTER IN A MAZE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the minister departed, in advance of Hester Prynne and little Pearl,\r\nhe threw a backward glance, half expecting that he should discover only\r\nsome faintly traced features or outline of the mother and the child,\r\nslowly fading into the twilight of the woods. So great a vicissitude in\r\nhis life could not at once be received as real. But there was Hester,\r\nclad in her gray robe, still standing beside the tree-trunk, which some\r\nblast had overthrown a long antiquity ago, and which time had ever\r\nsince been covering with moss, so that these two fated ones, with\r\nearth’s heaviest burden on them, might there sit down together, and\r\nfind a single hour’s rest and solace. And there was Pearl, too, lightly\r\ndancing from the margin of the brook—now that the intrusive third\r\nperson was gone—and taking her old place by her mother’s side. So the\r\nminister had not fallen asleep and dreamed!\r\n\r\nIn order to free his mind from this indistinctness and duplicity of\r\nimpression, which vexed it with a strange disquietude, he recalled and\r\nmore thoroughly defined the plans which Hester and himself had sketched\r\nfor their departure. It had been determined between them that the Old\r\nWorld, with its crowds and cities, offered them a more eligible shelter\r\nand concealment than the wilds of New England or all America, with its\r\nalternatives of an Indian wigwam, or the few settlements of Europeans\r\nscattered thinly along the sea-board. Not to speak of the clergyman’s\r\nhealth, so inadequate to sustain the hardships of a forest life, his\r\nnative gifts, his culture, and his entire development would secure him\r\na home only in the midst of civilization and refinement; the higher the\r\nstate the more delicately adapted to it the man. In furtherance of this\r\nchoice, it so happened that a ship lay in the harbour; one of those\r\nunquestionable cruisers, frequent at that day, which, without being\r\nabsolutely outlaws of the deep, yet roamed over its surface with a\r\nremarkable irresponsibility of character. This vessel had recently\r\narrived from the Spanish Main, and within three days’ time would sail\r\nfor Bristol. Hester Prynne—whose vocation, as a self-enlisted Sister of\r\nCharity, had brought her acquainted with the captain and crew—could\r\ntake upon herself to secure the passage of two individuals and a child\r\nwith all the secrecy which circumstances rendered more than desirable.\r\n\r\nThe minister had inquired of Hester, with no little interest, the\r\nprecise time at which the vessel might be expected to depart. It would\r\nprobably be on the fourth day from the present. “This is most\r\nfortunate!” he had then said to himself. Now, why the Reverend Mr.\r\nDimmesdale considered it so very fortunate we hesitate to reveal.\r\nNevertheless—to hold nothing back from the reader—it was because, on\r\nthe third day from the present, he was to preach the Election Sermon;\r\nand, as such an occasion formed an honourable epoch in the life of a\r\nNew England Clergyman, he could not have chanced upon a more suitable\r\nmode and time of terminating his professional career. “At least, they\r\nshall say of me,” thought this exemplary man, “that I leave no public\r\nduty unperformed or ill-performed!” Sad, indeed, that an introspection\r\nso profound and acute as this poor minister’s should be so miserably\r\ndeceived! We have had, and may still have, worse things to tell of him;\r\nbut none, we apprehend, so pitiably weak; no evidence, at once so\r\nslight and irrefragable, of a subtle disease that had long since begun\r\nto eat into the real substance of his character. No man, for any\r\nconsiderable period, can wear one face to himself and another to the\r\nmultitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nThe excitement of Mr. Dimmesdale’s feelings as he returned from his\r\ninterview with Hester, lent him unaccustomed physical energy, and\r\nhurried him townward at a rapid pace. The pathway among the woods\r\nseemed wilder, more uncouth with its rude natural obstacles, and less\r\ntrodden by the foot of man, than he remembered it on his outward\r\njourney. But he leaped across the plashy places, thrust himself through\r\nthe clinging underbrush, climbed the ascent, plunged into the hollow,\r\nand overcame, in short, all the difficulties of the track, with an\r\nunweariable activity that astonished him. He could not but recall how\r\nfeebly, and with what frequent pauses for breath he had toiled over the\r\nsame ground, only two days before. As he drew near the town, he took an\r\nimpression of change from the series of familiar objects that presented\r\nthemselves. It seemed not yesterday, not one, not two, but many days,\r\nor even years ago, since he had quitted them. There, indeed, was each\r\nformer trace of the street, as he remembered it, and all the\r\npeculiarities of the houses, with the due multitude of gable-peaks, and\r\na weather-cock at every point where his memory suggested one. Not the\r\nless, however, came this importunately obtrusive sense of change. The\r\nsame was true as regarded the acquaintances whom he met, and all the\r\nwell-known shapes of human life, about the little town. They looked\r\nneither older nor younger now; the beards of the aged were no whiter,\r\nnor could the creeping babe of yesterday walk on his feet today; it\r\nwas impossible to describe in what respect they differed from the\r\nindividuals on whom he had so recently bestowed a parting glance; and\r\nyet the minister’s deepest sense seemed to inform him of their\r\nmutability. A similar impression struck him most remarkably as he\r\npassed under the walls of his own church. The edifice had so very\r\nstrange, and yet so familiar an aspect, that Mr. Dimmesdale’s mind\r\nvibrated between two ideas; either that he had seen it only in a dream\r\nhitherto, or that he was merely dreaming about it now.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon, in the various shapes which it assumed, indicated no\r\nexternal change, but so sudden and important a change in the spectator\r\nof the familiar scene, that the intervening space of a single day had\r\noperated on his consciousness like the lapse of years. The minister’s\r\nown will, and Hester’s will, and the fate that grew between them, had\r\nwrought this transformation. It was the same town as heretofore, but\r\nthe same minister returned not from the forest. He might have said to\r\nthe friends who greeted him—“I am not the man for whom you take me! I\r\nleft him yonder in the forest, withdrawn into a secret dell, by a mossy\r\ntree trunk, and near a melancholy brook! Go, seek your minister, and\r\nsee if his emaciated figure, his thin cheek, his white, heavy,\r\npain-wrinkled brow, be not flung down there, like a cast-off garment!”\r\nHis friends, no doubt, would still have insisted with him—“Thou art\r\nthyself the man!” but the error would have been their own, not his.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Dimmesdale reached home, his inner man gave him other\r\nevidences of a revolution in the sphere of thought and feeling. In\r\ntruth, nothing short of a total change of dynasty and moral code, in\r\nthat interior kingdom, was adequate to account for the impulses now\r\ncommunicated to the unfortunate and startled minister. At every step he\r\nwas incited to do some strange, wild, wicked thing or other, with a\r\nsense that it would be at once involuntary and intentional, in spite of\r\nhimself, yet growing out of a profounder self than that which opposed\r\nthe impulse. For instance, he met one of his own deacons. The good old\r\nman addressed him with the paternal affection and patriarchal privilege\r\nwhich his venerable age, his upright and holy character, and his\r\nstation in the church, entitled him to use and, conjoined with this,\r\nthe deep, almost worshipping respect, which the minister’s professional\r\nand private claims alike demanded. Never was there a more beautiful\r\nexample of how the majesty of age and wisdom may comport with the\r\nobeisance and respect enjoined upon it, as from a lower social rank,\r\nand inferior order of endowment, towards a higher. Now, during a\r\nconversation of some two or three moments between the Reverend Mr.\r\nDimmesdale and this excellent and hoary-bearded deacon, it was only by\r\nthe most careful self-control that the former could refrain from\r\nuttering certain blasphemous suggestions that rose into his mind,\r\nrespecting the communion-supper. He absolutely trembled and turned pale\r\nas ashes, lest his tongue should wag itself in utterance of these\r\nhorrible matters, and plead his own consent for so doing, without his\r\nhaving fairly given it. And, even with this terror in his heart, he\r\ncould hardly avoid laughing, to imagine how the sanctified old\r\npatriarchal deacon would have been petrified by his minister’s impiety.\r\n\r\nAgain, another incident of the same nature. Hurrying along the street,\r\nthe Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale encountered the eldest female member of his\r\nchurch, a most pious and exemplary old dame, poor, widowed, lonely, and\r\nwith a heart as full of reminiscences about her dead husband and\r\nchildren, and her dead friends of long ago, as a burial-ground is full\r\nof storied gravestones. Yet all this, which would else have been such\r\nheavy sorrow, was made almost a solemn joy to her devout old soul, by\r\nreligious consolations and the truths of Scripture, wherewith she had\r\nfed herself continually for more than thirty years. And since Mr.\r\nDimmesdale had taken her in charge, the good grandam’s chief earthly\r\ncomfort—which, unless it had been likewise a heavenly comfort, could\r\nhave been none at all—was to meet her pastor, whether casually, or of\r\nset purpose, and be refreshed with a word of warm, fragrant,\r\nheaven-breathing Gospel truth, from his beloved lips, into her dulled,\r\nbut rapturously attentive ear. But, on this occasion, up to the moment\r\nof putting his lips to the old woman’s ear, Mr. Dimmesdale, as the\r\ngreat enemy of souls would have it, could recall no text of Scripture,\r\nnor aught else, except a brief, pithy, and, as it then appeared to him,\r\nunanswerable argument against the immortality of the human soul. The\r\ninstilment thereof into her mind would probably have caused this aged\r\nsister to drop down dead, at once, as by the effect of an intensely\r\npoisonous infusion. What he really did whisper, the minister could\r\nnever afterwards recollect. There was, perhaps, a fortunate disorder in\r\nhis utterance, which failed to impart any distinct idea to the good\r\nwidow’s comprehension, or which Providence interpreted after a method\r\nof its own. Assuredly, as the minister looked back, he beheld an\r\nexpression of divine gratitude and ecstasy that seemed like the shine\r\nof the celestial city on her face, so wrinkled and ashy pale.\r\n\r\nAgain, a third instance. After parting from the old church member, he\r\nmet the youngest sister of them all. It was a maiden newly-won—and won\r\nby the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale’s own sermon, on the Sabbath after his\r\nvigil—to barter the transitory pleasures of the world for the heavenly\r\nhope that was to assume brighter substance as life grew dark around\r\nher, and which would gild the utter gloom with final glory. She was\r\nfair and pure as a lily that had bloomed in Paradise. The minister knew\r\nwell that he was himself enshrined within the stainless sanctity of her\r\nheart, which hung its snowy curtains about his image, imparting to\r\nreligion the warmth of love, and to love a religious purity. Satan,\r\nthat afternoon, had surely led the poor young girl away from her\r\nmother’s side, and thrown her into the pathway of this sorely tempted,\r\nor—shall we not rather say?—this lost and desperate man. As she drew\r\nnigh, the arch-fiend whispered him to condense into small compass, and\r\ndrop into her tender bosom a germ of evil that would be sure to blossom\r\ndarkly soon, and bear black fruit betimes. Such was his sense of power\r\nover this virgin soul, trusting him as she did, that the minister felt\r\npotent to blight all the field of innocence with but one wicked look,\r\nand develop all its opposite with but a word. So—with a mightier\r\nstruggle than he had yet sustained—he held his Geneva cloak before his\r\nface, and hurried onward, making no sign of recognition, and leaving\r\nthe young sister to digest his rudeness as she might. She ransacked her\r\nconscience—which was full of harmless little matters, like her pocket\r\nor her work-bag—and took herself to task, poor thing! for a thousand\r\nimaginary faults, and went about her household duties with swollen\r\neyelids the next morning.\r\n\r\nBefore the minister had time to celebrate his victory over this last\r\ntemptation, he was conscious of another impulse, more ludicrous, and\r\nalmost as horrible. It was—we blush to tell it—it was to stop short in\r\nthe road, and teach some very wicked words to a knot of little Puritan\r\nchildren who were playing there, and had but just begun to talk.\r\nDenying himself this freak, as unworthy of his cloth, he met a drunken\r\nseaman, one of the ship’s crew from the Spanish Main. And here, since\r\nhe had so valiantly forborne all other wickedness, poor Mr. Dimmesdale\r\nlonged at least to shake hands with the tarry blackguard, and recreate\r\nhimself with a few improper jests, such as dissolute sailors so abound\r\nwith, and a volley of good, round, solid, satisfactory, and\r\nheaven-defying oaths! It was not so much a better principle, as partly\r\nhis natural good taste, and still more his buckramed habit of clerical\r\ndecorum, that carried him safely through the latter crisis.\r\n\r\n“What is it that haunts and tempts me thus?” cried the minister to\r\nhimself, at length, pausing in the street, and striking his hand\r\nagainst his forehead.\r\n\r\n“Am I mad? or am I given over utterly to the fiend? Did I make a\r\ncontract with him in the forest, and sign it with my blood? And does he\r\nnow summon me to its fulfilment, by suggesting the performance of every\r\nwickedness which his most foul imagination can conceive?”\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale thus communed with\r\nhimself, and struck his forehead with his hand, old Mistress Hibbins,\r\nthe reputed witch-lady, is said to have been passing by. She made a\r\nvery grand appearance, having on a high head-dress, a rich gown of\r\nvelvet, and a ruff done up with the famous yellow starch, of which Anne\r\nTurner, her especial friend, had taught her the secret, before this\r\nlast good lady had been hanged for Sir Thomas Overbury’s murder.\r\nWhether the witch had read the minister’s thoughts or no, she came to a\r\nfull stop, looked shrewdly into his face, smiled craftily, and—though\r\nlittle given to converse with clergymen—began a conversation.\r\n\r\n“So, reverend sir, you have made a visit into the forest,” observed the\r\nwitch-lady, nodding her high head-dress at him. “The next time I pray\r\nyou to allow me only a fair warning, and I shall be proud to bear you\r\ncompany. Without taking overmuch upon myself my good word will go far\r\ntowards gaining any strange gentleman a fair reception from yonder\r\npotentate you wot of.”\r\n\r\n“I profess, madam,” answered the clergyman, with a grave obeisance,\r\nsuch as the lady’s rank demanded, and his own good breeding made\r\nimperative—“I profess, on my conscience and character, that I am\r\nutterly bewildered as touching the purport of your words! I went not\r\ninto the forest to seek a potentate, neither do I, at any future time,\r\ndesign a visit thither, with a view to gaining the favour of such\r\npersonage. My one sufficient object was to greet that pious friend of\r\nmine, the Apostle Eliot, and rejoice with him over the many precious\r\nsouls he hath won from heathendom!”\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha, ha!” cackled the old witch-lady, still nodding her high\r\nhead-dress at the minister. “Well, well! we must needs talk thus in the\r\ndaytime! You carry it off like an old hand! But at midnight, and in the\r\nforest, we shall have other talk together!”\r\n\r\nShe passed on with her aged stateliness, but often turning back her\r\nhead and smiling at him, like one willing to recognise a secret\r\nintimacy of connexion.\r\n\r\n“Have I then sold myself,” thought the minister, “to the fiend whom, if\r\nmen say true, this yellow-starched and velveted old hag has chosen for\r\nher prince and master?”\r\n\r\nThe wretched minister! He had made a bargain very like it! Tempted by a\r\ndream of happiness, he had yielded himself with deliberate choice, as\r\nhe had never done before, to what he knew was deadly sin. And the\r\ninfectious poison of that sin had been thus rapidly diffused throughout\r\nhis moral system. It had stupefied all blessed impulses, and awakened\r\ninto vivid life the whole brotherhood of bad ones. Scorn, bitterness,\r\nunprovoked malignity, gratuitous desire of ill, ridicule of whatever\r\nwas good and holy, all awoke to tempt, even while they frightened him.\r\nAnd his encounter with old Mistress Hibbins, if it were a real\r\nincident, did but show its sympathy and fellowship with wicked mortals,\r\nand the world of perverted spirits.\r\n\r\nHe had by this time reached his dwelling on the edge of the\r\nburial-ground, and, hastening up the stairs, took refuge in his study.\r\nThe minister was glad to have reached this shelter, without first\r\nbetraying himself to the world by any of those strange and wicked\r\neccentricities to which he had been continually impelled while passing\r\nthrough the streets. He entered the accustomed room, and looked around\r\nhim on its books, its windows, its fireplace, and the tapestried\r\ncomfort of the walls, with the same perception of strangeness that had\r\nhaunted him throughout his walk from the forest dell into the town and\r\nthitherward. Here he had studied and written; here gone through fast\r\nand vigil, and come forth half alive; here striven to pray; here borne\r\na hundred thousand agonies! There was the Bible, in its rich old\r\nHebrew, with Moses and the Prophets speaking to him, and God’s voice\r\nthrough all.\r\n\r\nThere on the table, with the inky pen beside it, was an unfinished\r\nsermon, with a sentence broken in the midst, where his thoughts had\r\nceased to gush out upon the page two days before. He knew that it was\r\nhimself, the thin and white-cheeked minister, who had done and suffered\r\nthese things, and written thus far into the Election Sermon! But he\r\nseemed to stand apart, and eye this former self with scornful pitying,\r\nbut half-envious curiosity. That self was gone. Another man had\r\nreturned out of the forest—a wiser one—with a knowledge of hidden\r\nmysteries which the simplicity of the former never could have reached.\r\nA bitter kind of knowledge that!\r\n\r\nWhile occupied with these reflections, a knock came at the door of the\r\nstudy, and the minister said, “Come in!”—not wholly devoid of an idea\r\nthat he might behold an evil spirit. And so he did! It was old Roger\r\nChillingworth that entered. The minister stood white and speechless,\r\nwith one hand on the Hebrew Scriptures, and the other spread upon his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n“Welcome home, reverend sir,” said the physician. “And how found you\r\nthat godly man, the Apostle Eliot? But methinks, dear sir, you look\r\npale, as if the travel through the wilderness had been too sore for\r\nyou. Will not my aid be requisite to put you in heart and strength to\r\npreach your Election Sermon?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, I think not so,” rejoined the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. “My\r\njourney, and the sight of the holy Apostle yonder, and the free air\r\nwhich I have breathed have done me good, after so long confinement in\r\nmy study. I think to need no more of your drugs, my kind physician,\r\ngood though they be, and administered by a friendly hand.”\r\n\r\nAll this time Roger Chillingworth was looking at the minister with the\r\ngrave and intent regard of a physician towards his patient. But, in\r\nspite of this outward show, the latter was almost convinced of the old\r\nman’s knowledge, or, at least, his confident suspicion, with respect to\r\nhis own interview with Hester Prynne. The physician knew then that in\r\nthe minister’s regard he was no longer a trusted friend, but his\r\nbitterest enemy. So much being known, it would appear natural that a\r\npart of it should be expressed. It is singular, however, how long a\r\ntime often passes before words embody things; and with what security\r\ntwo persons, who choose to avoid a certain subject, may approach its\r\nvery verge, and retire without disturbing it. Thus the minister felt no\r\napprehension that Roger Chillingworth would touch, in express words,\r\nupon the real position which they sustained towards one another. Yet\r\ndid the physician, in his dark way, creep frightfully near the secret.\r\n\r\n“Were it not better,” said he, “that you use my poor skill tonight?\r\nVerily, dear sir, we must take pains to make you strong and vigorous\r\nfor this occasion of the Election discourse. The people look for great\r\nthings from you, apprehending that another year may come about and find\r\ntheir pastor gone.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, to another world,” replied the minister with pious resignation.\r\n“Heaven grant it be a better one; for, in good sooth, I hardly think to\r\ntarry with my flock through the flitting seasons of another year! But\r\ntouching your medicine, kind sir, in my present frame of body I need it\r\nnot.”\r\n\r\n“I joy to hear it,” answered the physician. “It may be that my\r\nremedies, so long administered in vain, begin now to take due effect.\r\nHappy man were I, and well deserving of New England’s gratitude, could\r\nI achieve this cure!”\r\n\r\n“I thank you from my heart, most watchful friend,” said the Reverend\r\nMr. Dimmesdale with a solemn smile. “I thank you, and can but requite\r\nyour good deeds with my prayers.”\r\n\r\n“A good man’s prayers are golden recompense!” rejoined old Roger\r\nChillingworth, as he took his leave. “Yea, they are the current gold\r\ncoin of the New Jerusalem, with the King’s own mint mark on them!”\r\n\r\nLeft alone, the minister summoned a servant of the house, and requested\r\nfood, which, being set before him, he ate with ravenous appetite. Then\r\nflinging the already written pages of the Election Sermon into the\r\nfire, he forthwith began another, which he wrote with such an impulsive\r\nflow of thought and emotion, that he fancied himself inspired; and only\r\nwondered that Heaven should see fit to transmit the grand and solemn\r\nmusic of its oracles through so foul an organ pipe as he. However,\r\nleaving that mystery to solve itself, or go unsolved for ever, he drove\r\nhis task onward with earnest haste and ecstasy.\r\n\r\nThus the night fled away, as if it were a winged steed, and he\r\ncareering on it; morning came, and peeped, blushing, through the\r\ncurtains; and at last sunrise threw a golden beam into the study, and\r\nlaid it right across the minister’s bedazzled eyes. There he was, with\r\nthe pen still between his fingers, and a vast, immeasurable tract of\r\nwritten space behind him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\nTHE NEW ENGLAND HOLIDAY\r\n\r\n\r\nBetimes in the morning of the day on which the new Governor was to\r\nreceive his office at the hands of the people, Hester Prynne and little\r\nPearl came into the market-place. It was already thronged with the\r\ncraftsmen and other plebeian inhabitants of the town, in considerable\r\nnumbers, among whom, likewise, were many rough figures, whose attire of\r\ndeer-skins marked them as belonging to some of the forest settlements,\r\nwhich surrounded the little metropolis of the colony.\r\n\r\nOn this public holiday, as on all other occasions for seven years past,\r\nHester was clad in a garment of coarse gray cloth. Not more by its hue\r\nthan by some indescribable peculiarity in its fashion, it had the\r\neffect of making her fade personally out of sight and outline; while\r\nagain the scarlet letter brought her back from this twilight\r\nindistinctness, and revealed her under the moral aspect of its own\r\nillumination. Her face, so long familiar to the townspeople, showed the\r\nmarble quietude which they were accustomed to behold there. It was like\r\na mask; or, rather like the frozen calmness of a dead woman’s features;\r\nowing this dreary resemblance to the fact that Hester was actually\r\ndead, in respect to any claim of sympathy, and had departed out of the\r\nworld with which she still seemed to mingle.\r\n\r\nIt might be, on this one day, that there was an expression unseen\r\nbefore, nor, indeed, vivid enough to be detected now; unless some\r\npreternaturally gifted observer should have first read the heart, and\r\nhave afterwards sought a corresponding development in the countenance\r\nand mien. Such a spiritual seer might have conceived, that, after\r\nsustaining the gaze of the multitude through several miserable years as\r\na necessity, a penance, and something which it was a stern religion to\r\nendure, she now, for one last time more, encountered it freely and\r\nvoluntarily, in order to convert what had so long been agony into a\r\nkind of triumph. “Look your last on the scarlet letter and its\r\nwearer!”—the people’s victim and lifelong bond-slave, as they fancied\r\nher, might say to them. “Yet a little while, and she will be beyond\r\nyour reach! A few hours longer and the deep, mysterious ocean will\r\nquench and hide for ever the symbol which ye have caused to burn on her\r\nbosom!” Nor were it an inconsistency too improbable to be assigned to\r\nhuman nature, should we suppose a feeling of regret in Hester’s mind,\r\nat the moment when she was about to win her freedom from the pain which\r\nhad been thus deeply incorporated with her being. Might there not be an\r\nirresistible desire to quaff a last, long, breathless draught of the\r\ncup of wormwood and aloes, with which nearly all her years of womanhood\r\nhad been perpetually flavoured. The wine of life, henceforth to be\r\npresented to her lips, must be indeed rich, delicious, and\r\nexhilarating, in its chased and golden beaker, or else leave an\r\ninevitable and weary languor, after the lees of bitterness wherewith\r\nshe had been drugged, as with a cordial of intensest potency.\r\n\r\nPearl was decked out with airy gaiety. It would have been impossible to\r\nguess that this bright and sunny apparition owed its existence to the\r\nshape of gloomy gray; or that a fancy, at once so gorgeous and so\r\ndelicate as must have been requisite to contrive the child’s apparel,\r\nwas the same that had achieved a task perhaps more difficult, in\r\nimparting so distinct a peculiarity to Hester’s simple robe. The dress,\r\nso proper was it to little Pearl, seemed an effluence, or inevitable\r\ndevelopment and outward manifestation of her character, no more to be\r\nseparated from her than the many-hued brilliancy from a butterfly’s\r\nwing, or the painted glory from the leaf of a bright flower. As with\r\nthese, so with the child; her garb was all of one idea with her nature.\r\nOn this eventful day, moreover, there was a certain singular inquietude\r\nand excitement in her mood, resembling nothing so much as the shimmer\r\nof a diamond, that sparkles and flashes with the varied throbbings of\r\nthe breast on which it is displayed. Children have always a sympathy in\r\nthe agitations of those connected with them: always, especially, a\r\nsense of any trouble or impending revolution, of whatever kind, in\r\ndomestic circumstances; and therefore Pearl, who was the gem on her\r\nmother’s unquiet bosom, betrayed, by the very dance of her spirits, the\r\nemotions which none could detect in the marble passiveness of Hester’s\r\nbrow.\r\n\r\nThis effervescence made her flit with a bird-like movement, rather than\r\nwalk by her mother’s side.\r\n\r\nShe broke continually into shouts of a wild, inarticulate, and\r\nsometimes piercing music. When they reached the market-place, she\r\nbecame still more restless, on perceiving the stir and bustle that\r\nenlivened the spot; for it was usually more like the broad and lonesome\r\ngreen before a village meeting-house, than the centre of a town’s\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n“Why, what is this, mother?” cried she. “Wherefore have all the people\r\nleft their work today? Is it a play-day for the whole world? See,\r\nthere is the blacksmith! He has washed his sooty face, and put on his\r\nSabbath-day clothes, and looks as if he would gladly be merry, if any\r\nkind body would only teach him how! And there is Master Brackett, the\r\nold jailer, nodding and smiling at me. Why does he do so, mother?”\r\n\r\n“He remembers thee a little babe, my child,” answered Hester.\r\n\r\n“He should not nod and smile at me, for all that—the black, grim,\r\nugly-eyed old man!” said Pearl. “He may nod at thee, if he will; for\r\nthou art clad in gray, and wearest the scarlet letter. But see, mother,\r\nhow many faces of strange people, and Indians among them, and sailors!\r\nWhat have they all come to do, here in the market-place?”\r\n\r\n“They wait to see the procession pass,” said Hester. “For the Governor\r\nand the magistrates are to go by, and the ministers, and all the great\r\npeople and good people, with the music and the soldiers marching before\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“And will the minister be there?” asked Pearl. “And will he hold out\r\nboth his hands to me, as when thou ledst me to him from the\r\nbrook-side?”\r\n\r\n“He will be there, child,” answered her mother, “but he will not greet\r\nthee today, nor must thou greet him.”\r\n\r\n“What a strange, sad man is he!” said the child, as if speaking partly\r\nto herself. “In the dark nighttime he calls us to him, and holds thy\r\nhand and mine, as when we stood with him on the scaffold yonder! And in\r\nthe deep forest, where only the old trees can hear, and the strip of\r\nsky see it, he talks with thee, sitting on a heap of moss! And he\r\nkisses my forehead, too, so that the little brook would hardly wash it\r\noff! But, here, in the sunny day, and among all the people, he knows us\r\nnot; nor must we know him! A strange, sad man is he, with his hand\r\nalways over his heart!”\r\n\r\n“Be quiet, Pearl—thou understandest not these things,” said her mother.\r\n“Think not now of the minister, but look about thee, and see how cheery\r\nis everybody’s face today. The children have come from their schools,\r\nand the grown people from their workshops and their fields, on purpose\r\nto be happy, for, today, a new man is beginning to rule over them; and\r\nso—as has been the custom of mankind ever since a nation was first\r\ngathered—they make merry and rejoice: as if a good and golden year were\r\nat length to pass over the poor old world!”\r\n\r\nIt was as Hester said, in regard to the unwonted jollity that\r\nbrightened the faces of the people. Into this festal season of the\r\nyear—as it already was, and continued to be during the greater part of\r\ntwo centuries—the Puritans compressed whatever mirth and public joy\r\nthey deemed allowable to human infirmity; thereby so far dispelling the\r\ncustomary cloud, that, for the space of a single holiday, they appeared\r\nscarcely more grave than most other communities at a period of general\r\naffliction.\r\n\r\nBut we perhaps exaggerate the gray or sable tinge, which undoubtedly\r\ncharacterized the mood and manners of the age. The persons now in the\r\nmarket-place of Boston had not been born to an inheritance of Puritanic\r\ngloom. They were native Englishmen, whose fathers had lived in the\r\nsunny richness of the Elizabethan epoch; a time when the life of\r\nEngland, viewed as one great mass, would appear to have been as\r\nstately, magnificent, and joyous, as the world has ever witnessed. Had\r\nthey followed their hereditary taste, the New England settlers would\r\nhave illustrated all events of public importance by bonfires, banquets,\r\npageantries, and processions. Nor would it have been impracticable, in\r\nthe observance of majestic ceremonies, to combine mirthful recreation\r\nwith solemnity, and give, as it were, a grotesque and brilliant\r\nembroidery to the great robe of state, which a nation, at such\r\nfestivals, puts on. There was some shadow of an attempt of this kind in\r\nthe mode of celebrating the day on which the political year of the\r\ncolony commenced. The dim reflection of a remembered splendour, a\r\ncolourless and manifold diluted repetition of what they had beheld in\r\nproud old London—we will not say at a royal coronation, but at a Lord\r\nMayor’s show—might be traced in the customs which our forefathers\r\ninstituted, with reference to the annual installation of magistrates.\r\nThe fathers and founders of the commonwealth—the statesman, the priest,\r\nand the soldier—seemed it a duty then to assume the outward state and\r\nmajesty, which, in accordance with antique style, was looked upon as\r\nthe proper garb of public and social eminence. All came forth to move\r\nin procession before the people’s eye, and thus impart a needed dignity\r\nto the simple framework of a government so newly constructed.\r\n\r\nThen, too, the people were countenanced, if not encouraged, in relaxing\r\nthe severe and close application to their various modes of rugged\r\nindustry, which at all other times, seemed of the same piece and\r\nmaterial with their religion. Here, it is true, were none of the\r\nappliances which popular merriment would so readily have found in the\r\nEngland of Elizabeth’s time, or that of James—no rude shows of a\r\ntheatrical kind; no minstrel, with his harp and legendary ballad, nor\r\ngleeman with an ape dancing to his music; no juggler, with his tricks\r\nof mimic witchcraft; no Merry Andrew, to stir up the multitude with\r\njests, perhaps a hundred years old, but still effective, by their\r\nappeals to the very broadest sources of mirthful sympathy. All such\r\nprofessors of the several branches of jocularity would have been\r\nsternly repressed, not only by the rigid discipline of law, but by the\r\ngeneral sentiment which give law its vitality. Not the less, however,\r\nthe great, honest face of the people smiled—grimly, perhaps, but widely\r\ntoo. Nor were sports wanting, such as the colonists had witnessed, and\r\nshared in, long ago, at the country fairs and on the village-greens of\r\nEngland; and which it was thought well to keep alive on this new soil,\r\nfor the sake of the courage and manliness that were essential in them.\r\nWrestling matches, in the different fashions of Cornwall and\r\nDevonshire, were seen here and there about the market-place; in one\r\ncorner, there was a friendly bout at quarterstaff; and—what attracted\r\nmost interest of all—on the platform of the pillory, already so noted\r\nin our pages, two masters of defence were commencing an exhibition with\r\nthe buckler and broadsword. But, much to the disappointment of the\r\ncrowd, this latter business was broken off by the interposition of the\r\ntown beadle, who had no idea of permitting the majesty of the law to be\r\nviolated by such an abuse of one of its consecrated places.\r\n\r\nIt may not be too much to affirm, on the whole, (the people being then\r\nin the first stages of joyless deportment, and the offspring of sires\r\nwho had known how to be merry, in their day), that they would compare\r\nfavourably, in point of holiday keeping, with their descendants, even\r\nat so long an interval as ourselves. Their immediate posterity, the\r\ngeneration next to the early emigrants, wore the blackest shade of\r\nPuritanism, and so darkened the national visage with it, that all the\r\nsubsequent years have not sufficed to clear it up. We have yet to learn\r\nagain the forgotten art of gaiety.\r\n\r\nThe picture of human life in the market-place, though its general tint\r\nwas the sad gray, brown, or black of the English emigrants, was yet\r\nenlivened by some diversity of hue. A party of Indians—in their savage\r\nfinery of curiously embroidered deerskin robes, wampum-belts, red and\r\nyellow ochre, and feathers, and armed with the bow and arrow and\r\nstone-headed spear—stood apart with countenances of inflexible gravity,\r\nbeyond what even the Puritan aspect could attain. Nor, wild as were\r\nthese painted barbarians, were they the wildest feature of the scene.\r\nThis distinction could more justly be claimed by some mariners—a part\r\nof the crew of the vessel from the Spanish Main—who had come ashore to\r\nsee the humours of Election Day. They were rough-looking desperadoes,\r\nwith sun-blackened faces, and an immensity of beard; their wide short\r\ntrousers were confined about the waist by belts, often clasped with a\r\nrough plate of gold, and sustaining always a long knife, and in some\r\ninstances, a sword. From beneath their broad-brimmed hats of palm-leaf,\r\ngleamed eyes which, even in good-nature and merriment, had a kind of\r\nanimal ferocity. They transgressed without fear or scruple, the rules\r\nof behaviour that were binding on all others: smoking tobacco under the\r\nbeadle’s very nose, although each whiff would have cost a townsman a\r\nshilling; and quaffing at their pleasure, draughts of wine or\r\naqua-vitæ from pocket flasks, which they freely tendered to the gaping\r\ncrowd around them. It remarkably characterised the incomplete morality\r\nof the age, rigid as we call it, that a licence was allowed the\r\nseafaring class, not merely for their freaks on shore, but for far more\r\ndesperate deeds on their proper element. The sailor of that day would\r\ngo near to be arraigned as a pirate in our own. There could be little\r\ndoubt, for instance, that this very ship’s crew, though no unfavourable\r\nspecimens of the nautical brotherhood, had been guilty, as we should\r\nphrase it, of depredations on the Spanish commerce, such as would have\r\nperilled all their necks in a modern court of justice.\r\n\r\nBut the sea in those old times heaved, swelled, and foamed very much at\r\nits own will, or subject only to the tempestuous wind, with hardly any\r\nattempts at regulation by human law. The buccaneer on the wave might\r\nrelinquish his calling and become at once if he chose, a man of probity\r\nand piety on land; nor, even in the full career of his reckless life,\r\nwas he regarded as a personage with whom it was disreputable to traffic\r\nor casually associate. Thus the Puritan elders in their black cloaks,\r\nstarched bands, and steeple-crowned hats, smiled not unbenignantly at\r\nthe clamour and rude deportment of these jolly seafaring men; and it\r\nexcited neither surprise nor animadversion when so reputable a citizen\r\nas old Roger Chillingworth, the physician, was seen to enter the\r\nmarket-place in close and familiar talk with the commander of the\r\nquestionable vessel.\r\n\r\nThe latter was by far the most showy and gallant figure, so far as\r\napparel went, anywhere to be seen among the multitude. He wore a\r\nprofusion of ribbons on his garment, and gold lace on his hat, which\r\nwas also encircled by a gold chain, and surmounted with a feather.\r\nThere was a sword at his side and a sword-cut on his forehead, which,\r\nby the arrangement of his hair, he seemed anxious rather to display\r\nthan hide. A landsman could hardly have worn this garb and shown this\r\nface, and worn and shown them both with such a galliard air, without\r\nundergoing stern question before a magistrate, and probably incurring a\r\nfine or imprisonment, or perhaps an exhibition in the stocks. As\r\nregarded the shipmaster, however, all was looked upon as pertaining to\r\nthe character, as to a fish his glistening scales.\r\n\r\nAfter parting from the physician, the commander of the Bristol ship\r\nstrolled idly through the market-place; until happening to approach the\r\nspot where Hester Prynne was standing, he appeared to recognise, and\r\ndid not hesitate to address her. As was usually the case wherever\r\nHester stood, a small vacant area—a sort of magic circle—had formed\r\nitself about her, into which, though the people were elbowing one\r\nanother at a little distance, none ventured or felt disposed to\r\nintrude. It was a forcible type of the moral solitude in which the\r\nscarlet letter enveloped its fated wearer; partly by her own reserve,\r\nand partly by the instinctive, though no longer so unkindly, withdrawal\r\nof her fellow-creatures. Now, if never before, it answered a good\r\npurpose by enabling Hester and the seaman to speak together without\r\nrisk of being overheard; and so changed was Hester Prynne’s repute\r\nbefore the public, that the matron in town, most eminent for rigid\r\nmorality, could not have held such intercourse with less result of\r\nscandal than herself.\r\n\r\n“So, mistress,” said the mariner, “I must bid the steward make ready\r\none more berth than you bargained for! No fear of scurvy or ship fever\r\nthis voyage. What with the ship’s surgeon and this other doctor, our\r\nonly danger will be from drug or pill; more by token, as there is a lot\r\nof apothecary’s stuff aboard, which I traded for with a Spanish\r\nvessel.”\r\n\r\n“What mean you?” inquired Hester, startled more than she permitted to\r\nappear. “Have you another passenger?”\r\n\r\n“Why, know you not,” cried the shipmaster, “that this physician\r\nhere—Chillingworth he calls himself—is minded to try my cabin-fare with\r\nyou? Ay, ay, you must have known it; for he tells me he is of your\r\nparty, and a close friend to the gentleman you spoke of—he that is in\r\nperil from these sour old Puritan rulers.”\r\n\r\n“They know each other well, indeed,” replied Hester, with a mien of\r\ncalmness, though in the utmost consternation. “They have long dwelt\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\nNothing further passed between the mariner and Hester Prynne. But at\r\nthat instant she beheld old Roger Chillingworth himself, standing in\r\nthe remotest corner of the market-place and smiling on her; a smile\r\nwhich—across the wide and bustling square, and through all the talk and\r\nlaughter, and various thoughts, moods, and interests of the\r\ncrowd—conveyed secret and fearful meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\nTHE PROCESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Hester Prynne could call together her thoughts, and consider\r\nwhat was practicable to be done in this new and startling aspect of\r\naffairs, the sound of military music was heard approaching along a\r\ncontiguous street. It denoted the advance of the procession of\r\nmagistrates and citizens on its way towards the meeting-house: where,\r\nin compliance with a custom thus early established, and ever since\r\nobserved, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale was to deliver an Election\r\nSermon.\r\n\r\nSoon the head of the procession showed itself, with a slow and stately\r\nmarch, turning a corner, and making its way across the market-place.\r\nFirst came the music. It comprised a variety of instruments, perhaps\r\nimperfectly adapted to one another, and played with no great skill; but\r\nyet attaining the great object for which the harmony of drum and\r\nclarion addresses itself to the multitude—that of imparting a higher\r\nand more heroic air to the scene of life that passes before the eye.\r\nLittle Pearl at first clapped her hands, but then lost for an instant\r\nthe restless agitation that had kept her in a continual effervescence\r\nthroughout the morning; she gazed silently, and seemed to be borne\r\nupward like a floating sea-bird on the long heaves and swells of sound.\r\nBut she was brought back to her former mood by the shimmer of the\r\nsunshine on the weapons and bright armour of the military company,\r\nwhich followed after the music, and formed the honorary escort of the\r\nprocession. This body of soldiery—which still sustains a corporate\r\nexistence, and marches down from past ages with an ancient and\r\nhonourable fame—was composed of no mercenary materials. Its ranks were\r\nfilled with gentlemen who felt the stirrings of martial impulse, and\r\nsought to establish a kind of College of Arms, where, as in an\r\nassociation of Knights Templars, they might learn the science, and, so\r\nfar as peaceful exercise would teach them, the practices of war. The\r\nhigh estimation then placed upon the military character might be seen\r\nin the lofty port of each individual member of the company. Some of\r\nthem, indeed, by their services in the Low Countries and on other\r\nfields of European warfare, had fairly won their title to assume the\r\nname and pomp of soldiership. The entire array, moreover, clad in\r\nburnished steel, and with plumage nodding over their bright morions,\r\nhad a brilliancy of effect which no modern display can aspire to equal.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the men of civil eminence, who came immediately behind the\r\nmilitary escort, were better worth a thoughtful observer’s eye. Even in\r\noutward demeanour they showed a stamp of majesty that made the\r\nwarrior’s haughty stride look vulgar, if not absurd. It was an age when\r\nwhat we call talent had far less consideration than now, but the\r\nmassive materials which produce stability and dignity of character a\r\ngreat deal more. The people possessed by hereditary right the quality\r\nof reverence, which, in their descendants, if it survive at all, exists\r\nin smaller proportion, and with a vastly diminished force in the\r\nselection and estimate of public men. The change may be for good or\r\nill, and is partly, perhaps, for both. In that old day the English\r\nsettler on these rude shores—having left king, nobles, and all degrees\r\nof awful rank behind, while still the faculty and necessity of\r\nreverence was strong in him—bestowed it on the white hair and venerable\r\nbrow of age—on long-tried integrity—on solid wisdom and sad-coloured\r\nexperience—on endowments of that grave and weighty order which gave the\r\nidea of permanence, and comes under the general definition of\r\nrespectability. These primitive statesmen, therefore—Bradstreet,\r\nEndicott, Dudley, Bellingham, and their compeers—who were elevated to\r\npower by the early choice of the people, seem to have been not often\r\nbrilliant, but distinguished by a ponderous sobriety, rather than\r\nactivity of intellect. They had fortitude and self-reliance, and in\r\ntime of difficulty or peril stood up for the welfare of the state like\r\na line of cliffs against a tempestuous tide. The traits of character\r\nhere indicated were well represented in the square cast of countenance\r\nand large physical development of the new colonial magistrates. So far\r\nas a demeanour of natural authority was concerned, the mother country\r\nneed not have been ashamed to see these foremost men of an actual\r\ndemocracy adopted into the House of Peers, or make the Privy Council of\r\nthe Sovereign.\r\n\r\nNext in order to the magistrates came the young and eminently\r\ndistinguished divine, from whose lips the religious discourse of the\r\nanniversary was expected. His was the profession at that era in which\r\nintellectual ability displayed itself far more than in political life;\r\nfor—leaving a higher motive out of the question—it offered inducements\r\npowerful enough in the almost worshipping respect of the community, to\r\nwin the most aspiring ambition into its service. Even political\r\npower—as in the case of Increase Mather—was within the grasp of a\r\nsuccessful priest.\r\n\r\nIt was the observation of those who beheld him now, that never, since\r\nMr. Dimmesdale first set his foot on the New England shore, had he\r\nexhibited such energy as was seen in the gait and air with which he\r\nkept his pace in the procession. There was no feebleness of step as at\r\nother times; his frame was not bent, nor did his hand rest ominously\r\nupon his heart. Yet, if the clergyman were rightly viewed, his strength\r\nseemed not of the body. It might be spiritual and imparted to him by\r\nangelical ministrations. It might be the exhilaration of that potent\r\ncordial which is distilled only in the furnace-glow of earnest and\r\nlong-continued thought. Or perchance his sensitive temperament was\r\ninvigorated by the loud and piercing music that swelled heavenward,\r\nand uplifted him on its ascending wave. Nevertheless, so abstracted was\r\nhis look, it might be questioned whether Mr. Dimmesdale even heard the\r\nmusic. There was his body, moving onward, and with an unaccustomed\r\nforce. But where was his mind? Far and deep in its own region, busying\r\nitself, with preternatural activity, to marshal a procession of stately\r\nthoughts that were soon to issue thence; and so he saw nothing, heard\r\nnothing, knew nothing of what was around him; but the spiritual element\r\ntook up the feeble frame and carried it along, unconscious of the\r\nburden, and converting it to spirit like itself. Men of uncommon\r\nintellect, who have grown morbid, possess this occasional power of\r\nmighty effort, into which they throw the life of many days and then are\r\nlifeless for as many more.\r\n\r\nHester Prynne, gazing steadfastly at the clergyman, felt a dreary\r\ninfluence come over her, but wherefore or whence she knew not, unless\r\nthat he seemed so remote from her own sphere, and utterly beyond her\r\nreach. One glance of recognition she had imagined must needs pass\r\nbetween them. She thought of the dim forest, with its little dell of\r\nsolitude, and love, and anguish, and the mossy tree-trunk, where,\r\nsitting hand-in-hand, they had mingled their sad and passionate talk\r\nwith the melancholy murmur of the brook. How deeply had they known each\r\nother then! And was this the man? She hardly knew him now! He, moving\r\nproudly past, enveloped as it were, in the rich music, with the\r\nprocession of majestic and venerable fathers; he, so unattainable in\r\nhis worldly position, and still more so in that far vista of his\r\nunsympathizing thoughts, through which she now beheld him! Her spirit\r\nsank with the idea that all must have been a delusion, and that,\r\nvividly as she had dreamed it, there could be no real bond betwixt the\r\nclergyman and herself. And thus much of woman was there in Hester, that\r\nshe could scarcely forgive him—least of all now, when the heavy\r\nfootstep of their approaching Fate might be heard, nearer, nearer,\r\nnearer!—for being able so completely to withdraw himself from their\r\nmutual world—while she groped darkly, and stretched forth her cold\r\nhands, and found him not.\r\n\r\nPearl either saw and responded to her mother’s feelings, or herself\r\nfelt the remoteness and intangibility that had fallen around the\r\nminister. While the procession passed, the child was uneasy, fluttering\r\nup and down, like a bird on the point of taking flight. When the whole\r\nhad gone by, she looked up into Hester’s face—\r\n\r\n“Mother,” said she, “was that the same minister that kissed me by the\r\nbrook?”\r\n\r\n“Hold thy peace, dear little Pearl!” whispered her mother. “We must not\r\nalways talk in the market-place of what happens to us in the forest.”\r\n\r\n“I could not be sure that it was he—so strange he looked,” continued\r\nthe child. “Else I would have run to him, and bid him kiss me now,\r\nbefore all the people, even as he did yonder among the dark old trees.\r\nWhat would the minister have said, mother? Would he have clapped his\r\nhand over his heart, and scowled on me, and bid me begone?”\r\n\r\n“What should he say, Pearl,” answered Hester, “save that it was no time\r\nto kiss, and that kisses are not to be given in the market-place? Well\r\nfor thee, foolish child, that thou didst not speak to him!”\r\n\r\nAnother shade of the same sentiment, in reference to Mr. Dimmesdale,\r\nwas expressed by a person whose eccentricities—insanity, as we should\r\nterm it—led her to do what few of the townspeople would have ventured\r\non—to begin a conversation with the wearer of the scarlet letter in\r\npublic. It was Mistress Hibbins, who, arrayed in great magnificence,\r\nwith a triple ruff, a broidered stomacher, a gown of rich velvet, and a\r\ngold-headed cane, had come forth to see the procession. As this ancient\r\nlady had the renown (which subsequently cost her no less a price than\r\nher life) of being a principal actor in all the works of necromancy\r\nthat were continually going forward, the crowd gave way before her, and\r\nseemed to fear the touch of her garment, as if it carried the plague\r\namong its gorgeous folds. Seen in conjunction with Hester Prynne—kindly\r\nas so many now felt towards the latter—the dread inspired by Mistress\r\nHibbins had doubled, and caused a general movement from that part of\r\nthe market-place in which the two women stood.\r\n\r\n“Now, what mortal imagination could conceive it?” whispered the old\r\nlady confidentially to Hester. “Yonder divine man! That saint on earth,\r\nas the people uphold him to be, and as—I must needs say—he really\r\nlooks! Who, now, that saw him pass in the procession, would think how\r\nlittle while it is since he went forth out of his study—chewing a\r\nHebrew text of Scripture in his mouth, I warrant—to take an airing in\r\nthe forest! Aha! we know what that means, Hester Prynne! But truly,\r\nforsooth, I find it hard to believe him the same man. Many a church\r\nmember saw I, walking behind the music, that has danced in the same\r\nmeasure with me, when Somebody was fiddler, and, it might be, an Indian\r\npowwow or a Lapland wizard changing hands with us! That is but a\r\ntrifle, when a woman knows the world. But this minister. Couldst thou\r\nsurely tell, Hester, whether he was the same man that encountered thee\r\non the forest path?”\r\n\r\n“Madam, I know not of what you speak,” answered Hester Prynne, feeling\r\nMistress Hibbins to be of infirm mind; yet strangely startled and\r\nawe-stricken by the confidence with which she affirmed a personal\r\nconnexion between so many persons (herself among them) and the Evil\r\nOne. “It is not for me to talk lightly of a learned and pious minister\r\nof the Word, like the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale.”\r\n\r\n“Fie, woman—fie!” cried the old lady, shaking her finger at Hester.\r\n“Dost thou think I have been to the forest so many times, and have yet\r\nno skill to judge who else has been there? Yea, though no leaf of the\r\nwild garlands which they wore while they danced be left in their hair!\r\nI know thee, Hester, for I behold the token. We may all see it in the\r\nsunshine! and it glows like a red flame in the dark. Thou wearest it\r\nopenly, so there need be no question about that. But this minister! Let\r\nme tell thee in thine ear! When the Black Man sees one of his own\r\nservants, signed and sealed, so shy of owning to the bond as is the\r\nReverend Mr. Dimmesdale, he hath a way of ordering matters so that the\r\nmark shall be disclosed, in open daylight, to the eyes of all the\r\nworld! What is that the minister seeks to hide, with his hand always\r\nover his heart? Ha, Hester Prynne?”\r\n\r\n“What is it, good Mistress Hibbins?” eagerly asked little Pearl. “Hast\r\nthou seen it?”\r\n\r\n“No matter, darling!” responded Mistress Hibbins, making Pearl a\r\nprofound reverence. “Thou thyself wilt see it, one time or another.\r\nThey say, child, thou art of the lineage of the Prince of Air! Wilt\r\nthou ride with me some fine night to see thy father? Then thou shalt\r\nknow wherefore the minister keeps his hand over his heart!”\r\n\r\nLaughing so shrilly that all the market-place could hear her, the weird\r\nold gentlewoman took her departure.\r\n\r\nBy this time the preliminary prayer had been offered in the\r\nmeeting-house, and the accents of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale were\r\nheard commencing his discourse. An irresistible feeling kept Hester\r\nnear the spot. As the sacred edifice was too much thronged to admit\r\nanother auditor, she took up her position close beside the scaffold of\r\nthe pillory. It was in sufficient proximity to bring the whole sermon\r\nto her ears, in the shape of an indistinct but varied murmur and flow\r\nof the minister’s very peculiar voice.\r\n\r\nThis vocal organ was in itself a rich endowment, insomuch that a\r\nlistener, comprehending nothing of the language in which the preacher\r\nspoke, might still have been swayed to and fro by the mere tone and\r\ncadence. Like all other music, it breathed passion and pathos, and\r\nemotions high or tender, in a tongue native to the human heart,\r\nwherever educated. Muffled as the sound was by its passage through the\r\nchurch walls, Hester Prynne listened with such intenseness, and\r\nsympathized so intimately, that the sermon had throughout a meaning for\r\nher, entirely apart from its indistinguishable words. These, perhaps,\r\nif more distinctly heard, might have been only a grosser medium, and\r\nhave clogged the spiritual sense. Now she caught the low undertone, as\r\nof the wind sinking down to repose itself; then ascended with it, as it\r\nrose through progressive gradations of sweetness and power, until its\r\nvolume seemed to envelop her with an atmosphere of awe and solemn\r\ngrandeur. And yet, majestic as the voice sometimes became, there was\r\nfor ever in it an essential character of plaintiveness. A loud or low\r\nexpression of anguish—the whisper, or the shriek, as it might be\r\nconceived, of suffering humanity, that touched a sensibility in every\r\nbosom! At times this deep strain of pathos was all that could be heard,\r\nand scarcely heard sighing amid a desolate silence. But even when the\r\nminister’s voice grew high and commanding—when it gushed irrepressibly\r\nupward—when it assumed its utmost breadth and power, so overfilling the\r\nchurch as to burst its way through the solid walls, and diffuse itself\r\nin the open air—still, if the auditor listened intently, and for the\r\npurpose, he could detect the same cry of pain. What was it? The\r\ncomplaint of a human heart, sorrow-laden, perchance guilty, telling its\r\nsecret, whether of guilt or sorrow, to the great heart of mankind;\r\nbeseeching its sympathy or forgiveness,—at every moment,—in each\r\naccent,—and never in vain! It was this profound and continual undertone\r\nthat gave the clergyman his most appropriate power.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time, Hester stood, statue-like, at the foot of the\r\nscaffold. If the minister’s voice had not kept her there, there would,\r\nnevertheless, have been an inevitable magnetism in that spot, whence\r\nshe dated the first hour of her life of ignominy. There was a sense\r\nwithin her—too ill-defined to be made a thought, but weighing heavily\r\non her mind—that her whole orb of life, both before and after, was\r\nconnected with this spot, as with the one point that gave it unity.\r\n\r\nLittle Pearl, meanwhile, had quitted her mother’s side, and was playing\r\nat her own will about the market-place. She made the sombre crowd\r\ncheerful by her erratic and glistening ray, even as a bird of bright\r\nplumage illuminates a whole tree of dusky foliage by darting to and\r\nfro, half seen and half concealed amid the twilight of the clustering\r\nleaves. She had an undulating, but oftentimes a sharp and irregular\r\nmovement. It indicated the restless vivacity of her spirit, which\r\ntoday was doubly indefatigable in its tip-toe dance, because it was\r\nplayed upon and vibrated with her mother’s disquietude. Whenever Pearl\r\nsaw anything to excite her ever active and wandering curiosity, she\r\nflew thitherward, and, as we might say, seized upon that man or thing\r\nas her own property, so far as she desired it, but without yielding the\r\nminutest degree of control over her motions in requital. The Puritans\r\nlooked on, and, if they smiled, were none the less inclined to\r\npronounce the child a demon offspring, from the indescribable charm of\r\nbeauty and eccentricity that shone through her little figure, and\r\nsparkled with its activity. She ran and looked the wild Indian in the\r\nface, and he grew conscious of a nature wilder than his own. Thence,\r\nwith native audacity, but still with a reserve as characteristic, she\r\nflew into the midst of a group of mariners, the swarthy-cheeked wild\r\nmen of the ocean, as the Indians were of the land; and they gazed\r\nwonderingly and admiringly at Pearl, as if a flake of the sea-foam had\r\ntaken the shape of a little maid, and were gifted with a soul of the\r\nsea-fire, that flashes beneath the prow in the night-time.\r\n\r\nOne of these seafaring men the shipmaster, indeed, who had spoken to\r\nHester Prynne was so smitten with Pearl’s aspect, that he attempted to\r\nlay hands upon her, with purpose to snatch a kiss. Finding it as\r\nimpossible to touch her as to catch a humming-bird in the air, he took\r\nfrom his hat the gold chain that was twisted about it, and threw it to\r\nthe child. Pearl immediately twined it around her neck and waist with\r\nsuch happy skill, that, once seen there, it became a part of her, and\r\nit was difficult to imagine her without it.\r\n\r\n“Thy mother is yonder woman with the scarlet letter,” said the seaman,\r\n“Wilt thou carry her a message from me?”\r\n\r\n“If the message pleases me, I will,” answered Pearl.\r\n\r\n“Then tell her,” rejoined he, “that I spake again with the\r\nblack-a-visaged, hump shouldered old doctor, and he engages to bring\r\nhis friend, the gentleman she wots of, aboard with him. So let thy\r\nmother take no thought, save for herself and thee. Wilt thou tell her\r\nthis, thou witch-baby?”\r\n\r\n“Mistress Hibbins says my father is the Prince of the Air!” cried\r\nPearl, with a naughty smile. “If thou callest me that ill-name, I shall\r\ntell him of thee, and he will chase thy ship with a tempest!”\r\n\r\nPursuing a zigzag course across the market-place, the child returned to\r\nher mother, and communicated what the mariner had said. Hester’s\r\nstrong, calm steadfastly-enduring spirit almost sank, at last, on\r\nbeholding this dark and grim countenance of an inevitable doom, which\r\nat the moment when a passage seemed to open for the minister and\r\nherself out of their labyrinth of misery—showed itself with an\r\nunrelenting smile, right in the midst of their path.\r\n\r\nWith her mind harassed by the terrible perplexity in which the\r\nshipmaster’s intelligence involved her, she was also subjected to\r\nanother trial. There were many people present from the country round\r\nabout, who had often heard of the scarlet letter, and to whom it had\r\nbeen made terrific by a hundred false or exaggerated rumours, but who\r\nhad never beheld it with their own bodily eyes. These, after exhausting\r\nother modes of amusement, now thronged about Hester Prynne with rude\r\nand boorish intrusiveness. Unscrupulous as it was, however, it could\r\nnot bring them nearer than a circuit of several yards. At that distance\r\nthey accordingly stood, fixed there by the centrifugal force of the\r\nrepugnance which the mystic symbol inspired. The whole gang of sailors,\r\nlikewise, observing the press of spectators, and learning the purport\r\nof the scarlet letter, came and thrust their sunburnt and\r\ndesperado-looking faces into the ring. Even the Indians were affected\r\nby a sort of cold shadow of the white man’s curiosity and, gliding\r\nthrough the crowd, fastened their snake-like black eyes on Hester’s\r\nbosom, conceiving, perhaps, that the wearer of this brilliantly\r\nembroidered badge must needs be a personage of high dignity among her\r\npeople. Lastly, the inhabitants of the town (their own interest in this\r\nworn-out subject languidly reviving itself, by sympathy with what they\r\nsaw others feel) lounged idly to the same quarter, and tormented Hester\r\nPrynne, perhaps more than all the rest, with their cool,\r\nwell-acquainted gaze at her familiar shame. Hester saw and recognized\r\nthe selfsame faces of that group of matrons, who had awaited her\r\nforthcoming from the prison-door seven years ago; all save one, the\r\nyoungest and only compassionate among them, whose burial-robe she had\r\nsince made. At the final hour, when she was so soon to fling aside the\r\nburning letter, it had strangely become the centre of more remark and\r\nexcitement, and was thus made to sear her breast more painfully, than\r\nat any time since the first day she put it on.\r\n\r\nWhile Hester stood in that magic circle of ignominy, where the cunning\r\ncruelty of her sentence seemed to have fixed her for ever, the\r\nadmirable preacher was looking down from the sacred pulpit upon an\r\naudience whose very inmost spirits had yielded to his control. The\r\nsainted minister in the church! The woman of the scarlet letter in the\r\nmarket-place! What imagination would have been irreverent enough to\r\nsurmise that the same scorching stigma was on them both!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\nTHE REVELATION OF THE SCARLET LETTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eloquent voice, on which the souls of the listening audience had\r\nbeen borne aloft as on the swelling waves of the sea, at length came to\r\na pause. There was a momentary silence, profound as what should follow\r\nthe utterance of oracles. Then ensued a murmur and half-hushed tumult,\r\nas if the auditors, released from the high spell that had transported\r\nthem into the region of another’s mind, were returning into themselves,\r\nwith all their awe and wonder still heavy on them. In a moment more the\r\ncrowd began to gush forth from the doors of the church. Now that there\r\nwas an end, they needed more breath, more fit to support the gross and\r\nearthly life into which they relapsed, than that atmosphere which the\r\npreacher had converted into words of flame, and had burdened with the\r\nrich fragrance of his thought.\r\n\r\nIn the open air their rapture broke into speech. The street and the\r\nmarket-place absolutely babbled, from side to side, with applauses of\r\nthe minister. His hearers could not rest until they had told one\r\nanother of what each knew better than he could tell or hear.\r\n\r\nAccording to their united testimony, never had man spoken in so wise,\r\nso high, and so holy a spirit, as he that spake this day; nor had\r\ninspiration ever breathed through mortal lips more evidently than it\r\ndid through his. Its influence could be seen, as it were, descending\r\nupon him, and possessing him, and continually lifting him out of the\r\nwritten discourse that lay before him, and filling him with ideas that\r\nmust have been as marvellous to himself as to his audience. His\r\nsubject, it appeared, had been the relation between the Deity and the\r\ncommunities of mankind, with a special reference to the New England\r\nwhich they were here planting in the wilderness. And, as he drew\r\ntowards the close, a spirit as of prophecy had come upon him,\r\nconstraining him to its purpose as mightily as the old prophets of\r\nIsrael were constrained, only with this difference, that, whereas the\r\nJewish seers had denounced judgments and ruin on their country, it was\r\nhis mission to foretell a high and glorious destiny for the newly\r\ngathered people of the Lord. But, throughout it all, and through the\r\nwhole discourse, there had been a certain deep, sad undertone of\r\npathos, which could not be interpreted otherwise than as the natural\r\nregret of one soon to pass away. Yes; their minister whom they so\r\nloved—and who so loved them all, that he could not depart heavenward\r\nwithout a sigh—had the foreboding of untimely death upon him, and would\r\nsoon leave them in their tears. This idea of his transitory stay on\r\nearth gave the last emphasis to the effect which the preacher had\r\nproduced; it was as if an angel, in his passage to the skies, had\r\nshaken his bright wings over the people for an instant—at once a shadow\r\nand a splendour—and had shed down a shower of golden truths upon them.\r\n\r\nThus, there had come to the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale—as to most men, in\r\ntheir various spheres, though seldom recognised until they see it far\r\nbehind them—an epoch of life more brilliant and full of triumph than\r\nany previous one, or than any which could hereafter be. He stood, at\r\nthis moment, on the very proudest eminence of superiority, to which the\r\ngifts or intellect, rich lore, prevailing eloquence, and a reputation\r\nof whitest sanctity, could exalt a clergyman in New England’s earliest\r\ndays, when the professional character was of itself a lofty pedestal.\r\nSuch was the position which the minister occupied, as he bowed his head\r\nforward on the cushions of the pulpit at the close of his Election\r\nSermon. Meanwhile Hester Prynne was standing beside the scaffold of the\r\npillory, with the scarlet letter still burning on her breast!\r\n\r\nNow was heard again the clamour of the music, and the measured tramp of\r\nthe military escort issuing from the church door. The procession was to\r\nbe marshalled thence to the town hall, where a solemn banquet would\r\ncomplete the ceremonies of the day.\r\n\r\nOnce more, therefore, the train of venerable and majestic fathers were\r\nseen moving through a broad pathway of the people, who drew back\r\nreverently, on either side, as the Governor and magistrates, the old\r\nand wise men, the holy ministers, and all that were eminent and\r\nrenowned, advanced into the midst of them. When they were fairly in the\r\nmarket-place, their presence was greeted by a shout. This—though\r\ndoubtless it might acquire additional force and volume from the\r\nchild-like loyalty which the age awarded to its rulers—was felt to be\r\nan irrepressible outburst of enthusiasm kindled in the auditors by that\r\nhigh strain of eloquence which was yet reverberating in their ears.\r\nEach felt the impulse in himself, and in the same breath, caught it\r\nfrom his neighbour. Within the church, it had hardly been kept down;\r\nbeneath the sky it pealed upward to the zenith. There were human beings\r\nenough, and enough of highly wrought and symphonious feeling to produce\r\nthat more impressive sound than the organ tones of the blast, or the\r\nthunder, or the roar of the sea; even that mighty swell of many voices,\r\nblended into one great voice by the universal impulse which makes\r\nlikewise one vast heart out of the many. Never, from the soil of New\r\nEngland had gone up such a shout! Never, on New England soil had stood\r\nthe man so honoured by his mortal brethren as the preacher!\r\n\r\nHow fared it with him, then? Were there not the brilliant particles of\r\na halo in the air about his head? So etherealised by spirit as he was,\r\nand so apotheosised by worshipping admirers, did his footsteps, in the\r\nprocession, really tread upon the dust of earth?\r\n\r\nAs the ranks of military men and civil fathers moved onward, all eyes\r\nwere turned towards the point where the minister was seen to approach\r\namong them. The shout died into a murmur, as one portion of the crowd\r\nafter another obtained a glimpse of him. How feeble and pale he looked,\r\namid all his triumph! The energy—or say, rather, the inspiration which\r\nhad held him up, until he should have delivered the sacred message that\r\nhad brought its own strength along with it from heaven—was withdrawn,\r\nnow that it had so faithfully performed its office. The glow, which\r\nthey had just before beheld burning on his cheek, was extinguished,\r\nlike a flame that sinks down hopelessly among the late decaying embers.\r\nIt seemed hardly the face of a man alive, with such a death-like hue:\r\nit was hardly a man with life in him, that tottered on his path so\r\nnervously, yet tottered, and did not fall!\r\n\r\nOne of his clerical brethren—it was the venerable John Wilson—observing\r\nthe state in which Mr. Dimmesdale was left by the retiring wave of\r\nintellect and sensibility, stepped forward hastily to offer his\r\nsupport. The minister tremulously, but decidedly, repelled the old\r\nman’s arm. He still walked onward, if that movement could be so\r\ndescribed, which rather resembled the wavering effort of an infant,\r\nwith its mother’s arms in view, outstretched to tempt him forward. And\r\nnow, almost imperceptible as were the latter steps of his progress, he\r\nhad come opposite the well-remembered and weather-darkened scaffold,\r\nwhere, long since, with all that dreary lapse of time between, Hester\r\nPrynne had encountered the world’s ignominious stare. There stood\r\nHester, holding little Pearl by the hand! And there was the scarlet\r\nletter on her breast! The minister here made a pause; although the\r\nmusic still played the stately and rejoicing march to which the\r\nprocession moved. It summoned him onward—inward to the festival!—but\r\nhere he made a pause.\r\n\r\nBellingham, for the last few moments, had kept an anxious eye upon him.\r\nHe now left his own place in the procession, and advanced to give\r\nassistance judging, from Mr. Dimmesdale’s aspect that he must otherwise\r\ninevitably fall. But there was something in the latter’s expression\r\nthat warned back the magistrate, although a man not readily obeying the\r\nvague intimations that pass from one spirit to another. The crowd,\r\nmeanwhile, looked on with awe and wonder. This earthly faintness, was,\r\nin their view, only another phase of the minister’s celestial strength;\r\nnor would it have seemed a miracle too high to be wrought for one so\r\nholy, had he ascended before their eyes, waxing dimmer and brighter,\r\nand fading at last into the light of heaven!\r\n\r\nHe turned towards the scaffold, and stretched forth his arms.\r\n\r\n“Hester,” said he, “come hither! Come, my little Pearl!”\r\n\r\nIt was a ghastly look with which he regarded them; but there was\r\nsomething at once tender and strangely triumphant in it. The child,\r\nwith the bird-like motion, which was one of her characteristics, flew\r\nto him, and clasped her arms about his knees. Hester Prynne—slowly, as\r\nif impelled by inevitable fate, and against her strongest will—likewise\r\ndrew near, but paused before she reached him. At this instant old Roger\r\nChillingworth thrust himself through the crowd—or, perhaps, so dark,\r\ndisturbed, and evil was his look, he rose up out of some nether\r\nregion—to snatch back his victim from what he sought to do! Be that as\r\nit might, the old man rushed forward, and caught the minister by the\r\narm.\r\n\r\n“Madman, hold! what is your purpose?” whispered he. “Wave back that\r\nwoman! Cast off this child! All shall be well! Do not blacken your\r\nfame, and perish in dishonour! I can yet save you! Would you bring\r\ninfamy on your sacred profession?”\r\n\r\n“Ha, tempter! Methinks thou art too late!” answered the minister,\r\nencountering his eye, fearfully, but firmly. “Thy power is not what it\r\nwas! With God’s help, I shall escape thee now!”\r\n\r\nHe again extended his hand to the woman of the scarlet letter.\r\n\r\n“Hester Prynne,” cried he, with a piercing earnestness, “in the name of\r\nHim, so terrible and so merciful, who gives me grace, at this last\r\nmoment, to do what—for my own heavy sin and miserable agony—I withheld\r\nmyself from doing seven years ago, come hither now, and twine thy\r\nstrength about me! Thy strength, Hester; but let it be guided by the\r\nwill which God hath granted me! This wretched and wronged old man is\r\nopposing it with all his might!—with all his own might, and the\r\nfiend’s! Come, Hester—come! Support me up yonder scaffold.”\r\n\r\nThe crowd was in a tumult. The men of rank and dignity, who stood more\r\nimmediately around the clergyman, were so taken by surprise, and so\r\nperplexed as to the purport of what they saw—unable to receive the\r\nexplanation which most readily presented itself, or to imagine any\r\nother—that they remained silent and inactive spectators of the\r\njudgement which Providence seemed about to work. They beheld the\r\nminister, leaning on Hester’s shoulder, and supported by her arm around\r\nhim, approach the scaffold, and ascend its steps; while still the\r\nlittle hand of the sin-born child was clasped in his. Old Roger\r\nChillingworth followed, as one intimately connected with the drama of\r\nguilt and sorrow in which they had all been actors, and well entitled,\r\ntherefore to be present at its closing scene.\r\n\r\n“Hadst thou sought the whole earth over,” said he looking darkly at the\r\nclergyman, “there was no one place so secret—no high place nor lowly\r\nplace, where thou couldst have escaped me—save on this very scaffold!”\r\n\r\n“Thanks be to Him who hath led me hither!” answered the minister.\r\n\r\nYet he trembled, and turned to Hester, with an expression of doubt and\r\nanxiety in his eyes, not the less evidently betrayed, that there was a\r\nfeeble smile upon his lips.\r\n\r\n“Is not this better,” murmured he, “than what we dreamed of in the\r\nforest?”\r\n\r\n“I know not! I know not!” she hurriedly replied. “Better? Yea; so we\r\nmay both die, and little Pearl die with us!”\r\n\r\n“For thee and Pearl, be it as God shall order,” said the minister; “and\r\nGod is merciful! Let me now do the will which He hath made plain before\r\nmy sight. For, Hester, I am a dying man. So let me make haste to take\r\nmy shame upon me!”\r\n\r\nPartly supported by Hester Prynne, and holding one hand of little\r\nPearl’s, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale turned to the dignified and\r\nvenerable rulers; to the holy ministers, who were his brethren; to the\r\npeople, whose great heart was thoroughly appalled yet overflowing with\r\ntearful sympathy, as knowing that some deep life-matter—which, if full\r\nof sin, was full of anguish and repentance likewise—was now to be laid\r\nopen to them. The sun, but little past its meridian, shone down upon\r\nthe clergyman, and gave a distinctness to his figure, as he stood out\r\nfrom all the earth, to put in his plea of guilty at the bar of Eternal\r\nJustice.\r\n\r\n“People of New England!” cried he, with a voice that rose over them,\r\nhigh, solemn, and majestic—yet had always a tremor through it, and\r\nsometimes a shriek, struggling up out of a fathomless depth of remorse\r\nand woe—“ye, that have loved me!—ye, that have deemed me holy!—behold\r\nme here, the one sinner of the world! At last—at last!—I stand upon the\r\nspot where, seven years since, I should have stood, here, with this\r\nwoman, whose arm, more than the little strength wherewith I have crept\r\nhitherward, sustains me at this dreadful moment, from grovelling down\r\nupon my face! Lo, the scarlet letter which Hester wears! Ye have all\r\nshuddered at it! Wherever her walk hath been—wherever, so miserably\r\nburdened, she may have hoped to find repose—it hath cast a lurid gleam\r\nof awe and horrible repugnance round about her. But there stood one in\r\nthe midst of you, at whose brand of sin and infamy ye have not\r\nshuddered!”\r\n\r\nIt seemed, at this point, as if the minister must leave the remainder\r\nof his secret undisclosed. But he fought back the bodily weakness—and,\r\nstill more, the faintness of heart—that was striving for the mastery\r\nwith him. He threw off all assistance, and stepped passionately forward\r\na pace before the woman and the children.\r\n\r\n“It was on him!” he continued, with a kind of fierceness; so determined\r\nwas he to speak out the whole. “God’s eye beheld it! The angels were\r\nfor ever pointing at it! (The Devil knew it well, and fretted it\r\ncontinually with the touch of his burning finger!) But he hid it\r\ncunningly from men, and walked among you with the mien of a spirit,\r\nmournful, because so pure in a sinful world!—and sad, because he missed\r\nhis heavenly kindred! Now, at the death-hour, he stands up before you!\r\nHe bids you look again at Hester’s scarlet letter! He tells you, that,\r\nwith all its mysterious horror, it is but the shadow of what he bears\r\non his own breast, and that even this, his own red stigma, is no more\r\nthan the type of what has seared his inmost heart! Stand any here that\r\nquestion God’s judgment on a sinner! Behold! Behold, a dreadful witness\r\nof it!”\r\n\r\nWith a convulsive motion, he tore away the ministerial band from before\r\nhis breast. It was revealed! But it were irreverent to describe that\r\nrevelation. For an instant, the gaze of the horror-stricken multitude\r\nwas concentrated on the ghastly miracle; while the minister stood, with\r\na flush of triumph in his face, as one who, in the crisis of acutest\r\npain, had won a victory. Then, down he sank upon the scaffold! Hester\r\npartly raised him, and supported his head against her bosom. Old Roger\r\nChillingworth knelt down beside him, with a blank, dull countenance,\r\nout of which the life seemed to have departed.\r\n\r\n“Thou hast escaped me!” he repeated more than once. “Thou hast escaped\r\nme!”\r\n\r\n“May God forgive thee!” said the minister. “Thou, too, hast deeply\r\nsinned!”\r\n\r\nHe withdrew his dying eyes from the old man, and fixed them on the\r\nwoman and the child.\r\n\r\n“My little Pearl,” said he, feebly and there was a sweet and gentle\r\nsmile over his face, as of a spirit sinking into deep repose; nay, now\r\nthat the burden was removed, it seemed almost as if he would be\r\nsportive with the child—“dear little Pearl, wilt thou kiss me now? Thou\r\nwouldst not, yonder, in the forest! But now thou wilt?”\r\n\r\nPearl kissed his lips. A spell was broken. The great scene of grief, in\r\nwhich the wild infant bore a part had developed all her sympathies; and\r\nas her tears fell upon her father’s cheek, they were the pledge that\r\nshe would grow up amid human joy and sorrow, nor forever do battle with\r\nthe world, but be a woman in it. Towards her mother, too, Pearl’s\r\nerrand as a messenger of anguish was fulfilled.\r\n\r\n“Hester,” said the clergyman, “farewell!”\r\n\r\n“Shall we not meet again?” whispered she, bending her face down close\r\nto his. “Shall we not spend our immortal life together? Surely, surely,\r\nwe have ransomed one another, with all this woe! Thou lookest far into\r\neternity, with those bright dying eyes! Then tell me what thou seest!”\r\n\r\n“Hush, Hester—hush!” said he, with tremulous solemnity. “The law we\r\nbroke!—the sin here awfully revealed!—let these alone be in thy\r\nthoughts! I fear! I fear! It may be, that, when we forgot our God—when\r\nwe violated our reverence each for the other’s soul—it was thenceforth\r\nvain to hope that we could meet hereafter, in an everlasting and pure\r\nreunion. God knows; and He is merciful! He hath proved his mercy, most\r\nof all, in my afflictions. By giving me this burning torture to bear\r\nupon my breast! By sending yonder dark and terrible old man, to keep\r\nthe torture always at red-heat! By bringing me hither, to die this\r\ndeath of triumphant ignominy before the people! Had either of these\r\nagonies been wanting, I had been lost for ever! Praised be His name!\r\nHis will be done! Farewell!”\r\n\r\nThat final word came forth with the minister’s expiring breath. The\r\nmultitude, silent till then, broke out in a strange, deep voice of awe\r\nand wonder, which could not as yet find utterance, save in this murmur\r\nthat rolled so heavily after the departed spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter many days, when time sufficed for the people to arrange their\r\nthoughts in reference to the foregoing scene, there was more than one\r\naccount of what had been witnessed on the scaffold.\r\n\r\nMost of the spectators testified to having seen, on the breast of the\r\nunhappy minister, a SCARLET LETTER—the very semblance of that worn by\r\nHester Prynne—imprinted in the flesh. As regarded its origin there were\r\nvarious explanations, all of which must necessarily have been\r\nconjectural. Some affirmed that the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, on the\r\nvery day when Hester Prynne first wore her ignominious badge, had begun\r\na course of penance—which he afterwards, in so many futile methods,\r\nfollowed out—by inflicting a hideous torture on himself. Others\r\ncontended that the stigma had not been produced until a long time\r\nsubsequent, when old Roger Chillingworth, being a potent necromancer,\r\nhad caused it to appear, through the agency of magic and poisonous\r\ndrugs. Others, again and those best able to appreciate the minister’s\r\npeculiar sensibility, and the wonderful operation of his spirit upon\r\nthe body—whispered their belief, that the awful symbol was the effect\r\nof the ever-active tooth of remorse, gnawing from the inmost heart\r\noutwardly, and at last manifesting Heaven’s dreadful judgment by the\r\nvisible presence of the letter. The reader may choose among these\r\ntheories. We have thrown all the light we could acquire upon the\r\nportent, and would gladly, now that it has done its office, erase its\r\ndeep print out of our own brain, where long meditation has fixed it in\r\nvery undesirable distinctness.\r\n\r\nIt is singular, nevertheless, that certain persons, who were spectators\r\nof the whole scene, and professed never once to have removed their eyes\r\nfrom the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, denied that there was any mark\r\nwhatever on his breast, more than on a new-born infant’s. Neither, by\r\ntheir report, had his dying words acknowledged, nor even remotely\r\nimplied, any—the slightest—connexion on his part, with the guilt for\r\nwhich Hester Prynne had so long worn the scarlet letter. According to\r\nthese highly-respectable witnesses, the minister, conscious that he was\r\ndying—conscious, also, that the reverence of the multitude placed him\r\nalready among saints and angels—had desired, by yielding up his breath\r\nin the arms of that fallen woman, to express to the world how utterly\r\nnugatory is the choicest of man’s own righteousness. After exhausting\r\nlife in his efforts for mankind’s spiritual good, he had made the\r\nmanner of his death a parable, in order to impress on his admirers the\r\nmighty and mournful lesson, that, in the view of Infinite Purity, we\r\nare sinners all alike. It was to teach them, that the holiest amongst\r\nus has but attained so far above his fellows as to discern more clearly\r\nthe Mercy which looks down, and repudiate more utterly the phantom of\r\nhuman merit, which would look aspiringly upward. Without disputing a\r\ntruth so momentous, we must be allowed to consider this version of Mr.\r\nDimmesdale’s story as only an instance of that stubborn fidelity with\r\nwhich a man’s friends—and especially a clergyman’s—will sometimes\r\nuphold his character, when proofs, clear as the mid-day sunshine on the\r\nscarlet letter, establish him a false and sin-stained creature of the\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nThe authority which we have chiefly followed—a manuscript of old date,\r\ndrawn up from the verbal testimony of individuals, some of whom had\r\nknown Hester Prynne, while others had heard the tale from contemporary\r\nwitnesses fully confirms the view taken in the foregoing pages. Among\r\nmany morals which press upon us from the poor minister’s miserable\r\nexperience, we put only this into a sentence:—“Be true! Be true! Be\r\ntrue! Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some trait\r\nwhereby the worst may be inferred!”\r\n\r\nNothing was more remarkable than the change which took place, almost\r\nimmediately after Mr. Dimmesdale’s death, in the appearance and\r\ndemeanour of the old man known as Roger Chillingworth. All his strength\r\nand energy—all his vital and intellectual force—seemed at once to\r\ndesert him, insomuch that he positively withered up, shrivelled away\r\nand almost vanished from mortal sight, like an uprooted weed that lies\r\nwilting in the sun. This unhappy man had made the very principle of his\r\nlife to consist in the pursuit and systematic exercise of revenge; and\r\nwhen, by its completest triumph consummation that evil principle was\r\nleft with no further material to support it—when, in short, there was\r\nno more Devil’s work on earth for him to do, it only remained for the\r\nunhumanised mortal to betake himself whither his master would find him\r\ntasks enough, and pay him his wages duly. But, to all these shadowy\r\nbeings, so long our near acquaintances—as well Roger Chillingworth as\r\nhis companions we would fain be merciful. It is a curious subject of\r\nobservation and inquiry, whether hatred and love be not the same thing\r\nat bottom. Each, in its utmost development, supposes a high degree of\r\nintimacy and heart-knowledge; each renders one individual dependent for\r\nthe food of his affections and spiritual fife upon another: each leaves\r\nthe passionate lover, or the no less passionate hater, forlorn and\r\ndesolate by the withdrawal of his subject. Philosophically considered,\r\ntherefore, the two passions seem essentially the same, except that one\r\nhappens to be seen in a celestial radiance, and the other in a dusky\r\nand lurid glow. In the spiritual world, the old physician and the\r\nminister—mutual victims as they have been—may, unawares, have found\r\ntheir earthly stock of hatred and antipathy transmuted into golden\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nLeaving this discussion apart, we have a matter of business to\r\ncommunicate to the reader. At old Roger Chillingworth’s decease, (which\r\ntook place within the year), and by his last will and testament, of\r\nwhich Governor Bellingham and the Reverend Mr. Wilson were executors,\r\nhe bequeathed a very considerable amount of property, both here and in\r\nEngland to little Pearl, the daughter of Hester Prynne.\r\n\r\nSo Pearl—the elf child—the demon offspring, as some people up to that\r\nepoch persisted in considering her—became the richest heiress of her\r\nday in the New World. Not improbably this circumstance wrought a very\r\nmaterial change in the public estimation; and had the mother and child\r\nremained here, little Pearl at a marriageable period of life might have\r\nmingled her wild blood with the lineage of the devoutest Puritan among\r\nthem all. But, in no long time after the physician’s death, the wearer\r\nof the scarlet letter disappeared, and Pearl along with her. For many\r\nyears, though a vague report would now and then find its way across the\r\nsea—like a shapeless piece of driftwood tossed ashore with the initials\r\nof a name upon it—yet no tidings of them unquestionably authentic were\r\nreceived. The story of the scarlet letter grew into a legend. Its\r\nspell, however, was still potent, and kept the scaffold awful where the\r\npoor minister had died, and likewise the cottage by the sea-shore where\r\nHester Prynne had dwelt. Near this latter spot, one afternoon some\r\nchildren were at play, when they beheld a tall woman in a gray robe\r\napproach the cottage-door. In all those years it had never once been\r\nopened; but either she unlocked it or the decaying wood and iron\r\nyielded to her hand, or she glided shadow-like through these\r\nimpediments—and, at all events, went in.\r\n\r\nOn the threshold she paused—turned partly round—for perchance the idea\r\nof entering alone and all so changed, the home of so intense a former\r\nlife, was more dreary and desolate than even she could bear. But her\r\nhesitation was only for an instant, though long enough to display a\r\nscarlet letter on her breast.\r\n\r\nAnd Hester Prynne had returned, and taken up her long-forsaken shame!\r\nBut where was little Pearl? If still alive she must now have been in\r\nthe flush and bloom of early womanhood. None knew—nor ever learned with\r\nthe fulness of perfect certainty—whether the elf-child had gone thus\r\nuntimely to a maiden grave; or whether her wild, rich nature had been\r\nsoftened and subdued and made capable of a woman’s gentle happiness.\r\nBut through the remainder of Hester’s life there were indications that\r\nthe recluse of the scarlet letter was the object of love and interest\r\nwith some inhabitant of another land. Letters came, with armorial seals\r\nupon them, though of bearings unknown to English heraldry. In the\r\ncottage there were articles of comfort and luxury such as Hester never\r\ncared to use, but which only wealth could have purchased and affection\r\nhave imagined for her. There were trifles too, little ornaments,\r\nbeautiful tokens of a continual remembrance, that must have been\r\nwrought by delicate fingers at the impulse of a fond heart. And once\r\nHester was seen embroidering a baby-garment with such a lavish richness\r\nof golden fancy as would have raised a public tumult had any infant\r\nthus apparelled, been shown to our sober-hued community.\r\n\r\nIn fine, the gossips of that day believed—and Mr. Surveyor Pue, who\r\nmade investigations a century later, believed—and one of his recent\r\nsuccessors in office, moreover, faithfully believes—that Pearl was not\r\nonly alive, but married, and happy, and mindful of her mother; and that\r\nshe would most joyfully have entertained that sad and lonely mother at\r\nher fireside.\r\n\r\nBut there was a more real life for Hester Prynne, here, in New England,\r\nthan in that unknown region where Pearl had found a home. Here had been\r\nher sin; here, her sorrow; and here was yet to be her penitence. She\r\nhad returned, therefore, and resumed—of her own free will, for not the\r\nsternest magistrate of that iron period would have imposed it—resumed\r\nthe symbol of which we have related so dark a tale. Never afterwards\r\ndid it quit her bosom. But, in the lapse of the toilsome, thoughtful,\r\nand self-devoted years that made up Hester’s life, the scarlet letter\r\nceased to be a stigma which attracted the world’s scorn and bitterness,\r\nand became a type of something to be sorrowed over, and looked upon\r\nwith awe, yet with reverence too. And, as Hester Prynne had no selfish\r\nends, nor lived in any measure for her own profit and enjoyment, people\r\nbrought all their sorrows and perplexities, and besought her counsel,\r\nas one who had herself gone through a mighty trouble. Women, more\r\nespecially—in the continually recurring trials of wounded, wasted,\r\nwronged, misplaced, or erring and sinful passion—or with the dreary\r\nburden of a heart unyielded, because unvalued and unsought came to\r\nHester’s cottage, demanding why they were so wretched, and what the\r\nremedy! Hester comforted and counselled them, as best she might. She\r\nassured them, too, of her firm belief that, at some brighter period,\r\nwhen the world should have grown ripe for it, in Heaven’s own time, a\r\nnew truth would be revealed, in order to establish the whole relation\r\nbetween man and woman on a surer ground of mutual happiness. Earlier in\r\nlife, Hester had vainly imagined that she herself might be the destined\r\nprophetess, but had long since recognised the impossibility that any\r\nmission of divine and mysterious truth should be confided to a woman\r\nstained with sin, bowed down with shame, or even burdened with a\r\nlife-long sorrow. The angel and apostle of the coming revelation must\r\nbe a woman, indeed, but lofty, pure, and beautiful, and wise; moreover,\r\nnot through dusky grief, but the ethereal medium of joy; and showing\r\nhow sacred love should make us happy, by the truest test of a life\r\nsuccessful to such an end.\r\n\r\nSo said Hester Prynne, and glanced her sad eyes downward at the scarlet\r\nletter. And, after many, many years, a new grave was delved, near an\r\nold and sunken one, in that burial-ground beside which King’s Chapel\r\nhas since been built. It was near that old and sunken grave, yet with a\r\nspace between, as if the dust of the two sleepers had no right to\r\nmingle. Yet one tomb-stone served for both. All around, there were\r\nmonuments carved with armorial bearings; and on this simple slab of\r\nslate—as the curious investigator may still discern, and perplex\r\nhimself with the purport—there appeared the semblance of an engraved\r\nescutcheon. It bore a device, a herald’s wording of which may serve for\r\na motto and brief description of our now concluded legend; so sombre is\r\nit, and relieved only by one ever-glowing point of light gloomier than\r\nthe shadow:—\r\n\r\n“ON A FIELD, SABLE, THE LETTER A, GULES.”",
