From the date of the splendid victory of\r\nOmdurman, 2nd September 1898, may be reckoned the creation of a vast\r\nSoudan empire. At so early a stage, it is idle to speculate whether\r\nthe country will be held as a British possession, or as a province of\r\nEgypt. \"The land of the blacks,\" and their truculent Arab despoilers,\r\nhas the intrinsic qualities that secure distinction. Given peace, it\r\nmay be expected that the mixed negroid races of the Upper Nile will\r\nprove themselves as orderly and industrious as they are conspicuously\r\nbrave. Whoever rules them wisely, will have the control of the best\r\nnative tribes of the Dark Continent, the raw material of a mighty\r\nstate. This, too, is foreshadowed; the dominant power in Central\r\nNorthern Africa, if no farther afield, will have its capital in\r\nKhartoum, \"Ethiopia will soon stretch out her hands unto God.\"\r\n\r\nThe recent events which have so altered the condition of affairs upon\r\nthe Upper Nile, deserve more than ephemeral record. A campaign so full\r\nof inspiriting incident, a victory which has brought presage of a\r\ngreat and prosperous Soudan, merits re-telling. Through half a score\r\nof battles or more, from the beginning to the death of Mahdism, I have\r\nfollowed British and Egyptian troops into action against the\r\ndervishes. I knew General Hicks, and had the luck to miss accompanying\r\nhis ill-fated expedition. In the present volume, \"Khartoum Campaign,\"\r\nthe narrative of the reconquest is completed, the history being\r\ncarried to the occupation of Fashoda and Sobat, including the\r\nwithdrawal of Major Marchand's French mission. I have made use of my\r\ntelegrams and letters to the _Daily Telegraph_, London, and the full\r\nnotes I made from day to day during the campaign. Besides, I have\r\nquoted in certain cases from official sources, and given extracts from\r\nverbal and written communications made to me by distinguished officers\r\nengaged in the operations.\r\n\r\nFor use of maps, sketches, and photographs, I am indebted to the\r\nproprietors of the _Daily Telegraph_, to Mr Ross of _Black and White_,\r\nSurgeon-General William Taylor, Colonel Frank Rhodes, Lieutenant E.

Before Tel-el-Kebir was fought in\r\nSeptember 1882 and the Egyptian army beaten and disbanded, the\r\ninsurrection headed by the Mahdi or False Prophet had begun. In the\r\ndisrupted condition of affairs which succeeded Arabi Pasha's defeat by\r\nBritish arms the dervish movement made further rapid progress. To Sir\r\nEvelyn Wood, V.C., at the close of 1882, was assigned the task, as\r\nSirdar or Commander-in-Chief of the Khedivial troops, of forming a\r\nreal native army. It was that distinguished soldier, aided by an\r\nexceptionally able staff, who first took in hand the re-organisation\r\nand proper training of the fellaheen recruits. By dint of drill,\r\ndiscipline and stiffening with British commissioned and\r\nnon-commissioned officers he soon made passable soldiers of the\r\n\"Gippies.\" The new army was at first restricted to eight battalions\r\nof Egyptian infantry, one regiment of cavalry, and four batteries of\r\nartillery. Although there were Soudanese amongst Arabi's troops, they\r\nwere mostly gunners. It was not until May 1884 that the first \"black\"\r\nregiment was raised. Yet it had been notorious that the Soudanese were\r\nthe only Khedivial soldiers who made anything of a stubborn stand\r\nagainst us in the 1882 campaign. The blacks who came down with the\r\nSalahieh garrison on the 9th of August 1882, and joined in the\r\nsurprise attack upon General Graham's brigade then in camp at\r\nKassassin, were not easily driven off. The large body of Egyptian\r\ninfantry and cavalry, although supported by several Krupp batteries\r\nwhich, issuing from the Tel-el-Kebir lines, assailed us in front, were\r\nreadily checked and pushed back. It was our right rear that the\r\n\"blacks\" and others forming the Salahieh column menaced, and it\r\nrequired some tough fighting before Sir Baker-Russell with his cavalry\r\nand horse artillery was able to drive them off. In truth, the \"blacks\"\r\nheld on long after the main body of Arabi's force had abandoned their\r\nintention of driving the British into the Suez Canal or the sea.\r\n\r\nThe first Soudanese battalion was recruited and mustered-in at Suakim.\r\nIt got the next numeral in regimental order, and so became known as\r\nthe \"Ninth.\" Many of the blacks who enlisted in the Ninth--Dinkas,\r\nShilluks, Gallas, and what not--were deserters from the Mahdi's\r\nbanner, or dervishes who had been taken prisoners at El Teb and Tamai.\r\nIt has never yet been deemed advisable to enrol any of the Arab\r\ntribesmen in the Khedivial regular army. Hadendowa, Kababish, Jaalin,\r\nBaggara, and many other clans, lack no physical qualifications for a\r\nmilitary career. Their desperate courage in support of a cause they\r\nhave at heart is an inspiration of self-immolation. But they are as\r\nuncertain and difficult to regulate by ordinary methods of discipline\r\nas the American Red Indian, and so are only fitted for irregular\r\nservice. In March 1885 General Sir Francis Grenfell succeeded to the\r\nSirdarship. With tact and energy he carried still further forward the\r\nexcellent work of his predecessor. Four additional Soudanese\r\nbattalions were created during his term, and the army was strengthened\r\nand better equipped for its duties in many other respects. Sir Francis\r\nhad the satisfaction of leading his untried soldiers against the\r\ndervishes, and winning brilliant victories and, in at least one\r\ninstance, over superior numbers. He it was, who, at Toski in August\r\n1889, routed an invading army of dervishes, whereat was killed their\r\nfamous leader Wad en Nejumi. That battle put an end to the dream of\r\nthe Mahdists to overrun and conquer Egypt and the world. The Khalifa\r\nthereafter found his safest policy, unless attacked, was to let the\r\nregular Egyptian forces severely alone.\r\n\r\nIt was shown that, when well handled, the fellaheen and the blacks\r\ncould defeat the dervishes. Lord Kitchener of Khartoum became Sirdar\r\nin the spring of 1892. His career in the land of the Nile may be\r\nbriefly summarised: first as a Lieutenant, then successively as\r\nCaptain, Major, Colonel and General, that Royal Engineer Officer from\r\n1882 has been actively employed either in Egypt proper or the Soudan.\r\nHe has, during that interval, been entrusted with many perilous and\r\ndelicate missions and independent commands. Whatever was given him to\r\ndo was carried through with zeal and resolution. In his time also\r\nlittle by little the Khedivial forces have been increased. A sixth\r\nSoudanese battalion was raised in 1896, and in that and the following\r\nyear four additional fellaheen battalions were added to the army. When\r\nthe Khartoum campaign began, the total muster-roll of the regular\r\ntroops was eighteen battalions of infantry, ten squadrons of cavalry,\r\na camel corps of eight companies, five batteries of artillery,\r\ntogether with the customary quota of engineers, medical staff,\r\ntransport, and other departmental troops. There was a railway\r\nconstruction battalion numbering at least 2000 men, but they were\r\nnon-combatants. As the whole armed strength of Egypt was, for the\r\noccasion, practically called into the field, the peace of the Delta\r\nhad to be secured by other means. A small armed body called the Coast\r\nGuard and the ordinary police, apart from the meagre British garrison,\r\nwere responsible for public tranquillity. The re-organisation and\r\nincrease of the Coast Guard, which was decided on, into an army of\r\n8000 men, was a brilliant idea, and one of the recent master-strokes\r\nof Lord Cromer and the Sirdar. It is ostensibly a quasi-civil force,\r\nand it was formed and equipped without the worry of international\r\nqueries and interference. The Coast Guard is mainly composed of picked\r\nmen, including old soldiers and reservists. Their duties carry them\r\ninto the interior as well as along the sea-coast, for, partly on\r\naccount of the salt tax, there are revenue defaulters along the\r\nborders of the Nile as well as by the Mediterranean and Red Sea. They\r\nare dressed like soldiers and are armed with Remingtons.\r\n\r\nMohammed Achmed, who called himself the Mahdi, or the last of the\r\nprophets, whose mission was to convert the world to Islamism, was a\r\nnative of Dongola. He was born near El Ordeh, or New Dongola, in 1848,\r\nand was the son of a carpenter. In person, he was above the medium\r\nheight, robust, and with a rather handsome Arab cast of features.\r\nDuring 1884 I saw his brother and two of his nephews in a village\r\nsouth of El Ordeh. All of them were tall stalwart men, light of\r\ncomplexion for Dongolese, courteous and hospitable to strangers.\r\nMohammed Achmed, from his youth, evinced a taste for religious studies\r\ncoupled with the ascetic extravagances of a too emotional nature. From\r\nKhartoum to Fashoda he acquired a great reputation for sanctity.\r\nReligious devotees gathered around him and followed him to his retreat\r\nupon the island of Abba. There he, in May 1881, first announced his\r\nclaims as the true Mahdi. His barefaced assertions of special divine\r\ncommand and guidance found credulous believers. With the wisdom of the\r\nserpent he had added to his influence and security as a prophet by\r\nmarrying daughters of Baggara sheiks, _i.e._ chiefs. Mohammed Achmed\r\nwas a vigorous and captivating preacher, learned in all the literature\r\nof the Koran, ever ready with apt and telling quotations. His early\r\nteaching was decidedly socialistic, including a command for the\r\noverthrow of the then existing civil state. His principles have been\r\nsummed up officially as \"an insistence upon universal law and\r\nreligion--his own--with community of goods, and death to all who\r\nrefused adherence to his tenets.\" Unfortunately, \"opportunity\" played\r\ninto his hands. The misrule of the Pashas, the burden of over-taxation\r\ncoupled with the legal suppression of the slave trade, and the\r\ndemoralisation of the Egyptian forces enabled Mohammed Achmed to rebel\r\nsuccessfully. Troops sent against him were defeated and annihilated.\r\nTowns capitulated to his arms and within a period of two years the\r\ninhabitants of the Soudan were hailing him as the true Mahdi, their\r\ninvincible deliverer. With the capture of Khartoum, on the morning of\r\nthe 26th of January 1885, and the abandonment of the Soudan and its\r\npopulation--the Egyptian frontier being fixed by British Government\r\norder at Wady Halfa--the over-lordship of that immense region from the\r\nSecond Cataract to the Equatorial Lakes was yielded to the so-called\r\nMahdi Mohammed Achmed did not long enjoy his conquests. Success killed\r\nhim as it has done many a lesser man. For a season he gave himself up\r\nto a life of indolence and the grossest lust. On the 22nd of June\r\n1885, less than six months after Gordon's head had been struck off and\r\nbrought to him, the Mahdi suddenly died. It is said by some that his\r\ndeath was due to smallpox, by others that one of his women captives\r\npoisoned him in revenge for the murder of her relatives. His demise\r\nwas kept secret for a time by his successor Abdullah, the chief\r\nKhalifa, and the other dervish leaders. It was given out that the\r\nMahdi's spirit had been called to Heaven for a space but would soon\r\nreturn to lead his hosts to fresh triumphs and further fat spoils. A\r\ntomb was erected over the place where his body lay, and the legend of\r\nhis mission was taken over by Abdullah, who also in due season had\r\nvisions and communicated reputed divine ordinances to the dervishes.\r\nAbdullah, who was ignorant, illiterate and cruel, far beyond his dead\r\nmaster--\"the cruellest man on earth,\" Slatin Pasha dubbed him,--by his\r\nexactions and treacheries soon overreached himself. Events were\r\nhastening to the overthrow of Mahdism. Sheiks and tribes fell away\r\nfrom the Khalifa and returned to the fold of orthodox Mohammedanism.\r\nBy 1889, as an aggressive force seeking to enlarge its boundaries,\r\nMahdism was spent. Thereafter, stage by stage, its power dwindled,\r\nalthough Omdurman, the dervish capital, remained the headquarters of\r\nthe strongest native military power that North Africa has ever known.\r\n\r\nLord Cromer has been blamed for many things he did, and much that he\r\nleft undone, during the earlier days of Mahdism. A fuller knowledge of\r\nthe whole circumstances justifies my saying that, as custodian of\r\n_British interests_, he acted throughout with singular prudence and\r\ngreat forbearance. It was not with his wish or approval that several\r\nof the untoward expeditions against the dervishes were undertaken. It\r\nis permissible to regret that, from a variety of causes, the British\r\nGovernment engaged in more than one ill-considered and irresolute\r\ncampaign for the destruction of Mahdism. Much treasure and countless\r\nthousands of lives were foolishly squandered and all without the\r\nleast compensating advantage. The barren results of the Soudan\r\ncampaigns directed from the War Office in Pall Mall form too painful a\r\nsubject for discussion. It is only fair to say, that the military\r\nofficials' hands may have been much hampered from Downing Street.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEADQUARTERS, WADY HALFA.]\r\n\r\nAs I have stated elsewhere, it was not until 1896 that the serious\r\nreconquest of the Soudan was begun. Before then there had been, as Mr\r\nGladstone after all appropriately termed them, \"military operations,\"\r\nbut not a state of war. He might have called them \"blood-spilling\r\nenterprises,\" for they were only that and no more. The re-occupation\r\nof the province of Dongola in 1896, freed the Nile up to Merawi, and\r\ngave the disaffected Kababish, Jaalin and riverain tribesmen a chance\r\nof reverting to their allegiance to the Khedive. It also enabled the\r\nSirdar to pass his gunboats farther up the river. Another gain issuing\r\nfrom the forward movement was that his right was secured from serious\r\nattack. Then followed the building of the wonderful Wady Halfa direct\r\ndesert railway towards Abu Hamid, Berber, and Dakhala at the mouth of\r\nthe Atbara. It was the 1897 campaign which put all these places into\r\nthe Sirdar's hands. During that year's high Nile, he passed his\r\ngunboats over the long stretch of cataracts betwixt Merawi and Abu\r\nHamid, and ran them up the river where they co-operated with the land\r\nforces, regulars and friendlies. Nay more, the steamers were set to do\r\na double duty: convey stores to the advanced posts and assail and\r\nharass the dervishes, pushing as far south as Shendy and Shabluka,\r\nthe Sixth Cataract. By prodigies of labour and enterprise the railroad\r\nwas speedily constructed to Abu Hamid, then on to Berber, and thence\r\nto Dakhala. The whole situation became greatly simplified the moment\r\nthe line reached Abu Hamid. From the first, the question of dealing a\r\ndeath-blow to Mahdism with British-led troops had turned upon the\r\nsolution of the transport problem. The through rail and river\r\nconnection once established from Cairo _via_ Wady Halfa to Abu Hamid\r\nput an end forever to all serious difficulty of providing adequate\r\nsupplies for the troops. From Abu Hamid the Nile is navigable far\r\nsouth for many months during the year. Then again, the occupation of\r\nAbu Hamid unlocked the Korosko desert caravan route and drew more wary\r\nand recanting dervishes away from the Khalifa. Following the capture\r\nof Abu Hamid, Berber was promptly taken for Egypt by the friendlies,\r\nand the Suakim-Berber trade route, which had been closed for many\r\nyears, was re-opened.\r\n\r\nThe end was slowly drawing near, for the Sirdar was closing the lines\r\nand mustering his forces for a final blow. Railroad construction went\r\nforward apace. At the rate of from one to two miles a day track was\r\nlaid so as to get the line up to Dakhala. Meanwhile, workshops were\r\nbeing erected at suitable points, and three additional screw gunboats,\r\nbuilt in England, were re-fitted for launching. The flotilla was\r\nbecoming formidable; it comprised 13 vessels, stern-wheelers and\r\nscrew-steamers, all armed with cannon and machine guns and protected\r\nby bullet-proof shields.\r\n\r\nBelieving there was a chance to wreck the railroad and capture\r\noutposts and stores, Mahmoud, a nephew and favourite general of the\r\nKhalifa's, led a powerful dervish army from Shendy north to raid the\r\ncountry to and beyond Berber. In spite of the gunboats, after\r\ndisposing of the recalcitrant Jaalins, Mahmoud crossed the Nile at\r\nMetemmeh to the opposite bank. Accompanied by the veteran rebel, Osman\r\nDigna, he quitted Aliab, marching to the north-east with 10,000\r\ninfantry, riflemen and spearmen, ten small rifled brass guns and 4000\r\ncavalry. It was his intention to cross the Atbara about 30 miles up\r\nfrom the Nile, and fall upon the flank and rear of the Sirdar's\r\ndetached and outlying troops, killing them in detail. He reckoned too\r\nconfidently and without full knowledge. Using the steamers and the\r\nrailways the Sirdar quickly concentrated his whole force, bringing men\r\nrapidly up from Wady Halfa and the province of Dongola. The entrenched\r\nEgyptian camp at the junction of the Atbara with the Nile was\r\nstrengthened, and General Gatacre's brigade of British troops was\r\nmoved on to Kunur, where Macdonald's and Maxwell's brigades also\r\nrepaired. Mahmoud had ultimately to be attacked in his own chosen\r\nfortified camp. His army was destroyed and he himself was taken\r\nprisoner. So closed the unexpected Atbara campaign in March last.\r\nThereafter, as the Khalifa showed no intention of inviting fresh\r\ndisaster by sending down another army to attack, the Sirdar despatched\r\nhis troops into summer rest-camps. Dry and shady spots were selected\r\nby the banks of the Nile between Berber and Dakhala. One or another of\r\nthe numberless deserted mud villages was usually chosen for\r\nheadquarters and offices. With these for a nucleus, the battalion or\r\nbrigade encampment was pitched in front and the quarters were fenced\r\nabout with cut mimosa thorn-bush, forming a zereba. All along the\r\nUpper Nile, wherever there is a strip of cultivable land, or where\r\nwater can be easily lifted from the river or wells for irrigation,\r\nthere the natives had villages of mud and straw huts. In many places,\r\nfor miles following miles, these hamlets fringe the river's banks,\r\nsheltered amidst groves of mimosa and palms. The fiendish cruelty and\r\nwanton destructiveness of the dervishes, who, not satiated with\r\nslaughtering the villagers--men, women and children--further glutted\r\ntheir fury by firing the homesteads and cutting down the date palms,\r\nresulted in depopulating the country. Ignorant and fanatical in their\r\nreligious frenzy to convert mankind to their new-found creed, the\r\nMahdists held that the surest way to rid the world forthwith of all\r\nunbelievers lay in making earth too intolerable to be lived in.\r\n\r\nThese native dwellings, when cleaned, were not uncomfortable abodes.\r\nAs the flat roofs were thickly covered with mats and grass whilst,\r\nexcept the doorway, the openings in the mud-walls were small, they\r\nwere even in the glare of noontide heat, pleasantly cool and shady.\r\nThe troops found that straw huts or tukals afforded far better\r\nprotection than the tents from the sun and from dust-storms. So it\r\ncame about that, copying the example set by the fellaheen and black\r\nsoldiers, \"Tommy Atkins\" also built himself shelters, and \"lean-to's\"\r\nof reeds, palm leaves and straw. Drills and field exercises were\r\nrelaxed, and the troops had time to rig up alfresco stages and\r\ntheatres and to enjoy variety entertainments provided by comrades with\r\ntalent for minstrelsy and the histrionic arts. Meanwhile the\r\npreparations for the final campaign against Mahdism were not\r\nslackened. Vast quantities of supplies and material of war were stored\r\nat Dakhala. Outposts were pushed forward and Shendy was occupied,\r\nwhilst Metemmeh was held by friendly Jaalin tribesmen, who had\r\nsuffered much at the Khalifa's hands. The Bayuda desert route also had\r\nbeen cleared of dervishes by these and by neighbouring tribesmen. On\r\nthe direct track from Korti to Omdurman, outlying wells and oases were\r\nin possession of the Kababish and their allies who had broken away\r\nfrom Abdullah's tyranny. The whirligig of time had transformed the\r\nequality preachings, and \"unity in the faith\" of Mahdism into the\r\nunbridled supremacy of the Baggara and especially the Taaisha branch\r\nof that sept over all the people of the Soudan. They alone were\r\nlicensed to rob, ravish and murder with impunity. It was the natural\r\nsequence of lawless society. Once the foe they leagued to plunder and\r\nkill had been disposed of, they turned and rent each other. Abdullah\r\nbeing a Taaisha, he, as a prop to his own pretensions, set them in\r\nauthority over all the races of the Soudan. One by one, however, Arab\r\nclansmen and blacks repented and deserted Mahdism.\r\n\r\nThe time was ripe for ending the mad mutiny against government and\r\ncivilisation. July is the period of high Nile in the upper reaches,\r\nand the Sirdar planned that his army should be ready to move forward\r\nby then. At that date all was in readiness. The Egyptian army which\r\nwas to take the field consisted of one division of four brigades, each\r\nof four battalions with artillery, cavalry and camelry. Besides these\r\nthere were two brigades of British infantry--Gatacre's division--a\r\nregiment of British cavalry, the 21st Lancers, and two and a half\r\nEnglish batteries, with many Maxims. It was known that Abdullah had\r\ncalled into Omdurman all his best men and meant giving battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDAYS OF WAITING AND PREPARATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Everything comes to him who waits,\" but the weariness of it is\r\nsometimes terrible. Oftentimes waiting is vain, without accompaniment\r\nof hard work. The Sirdar made deliberate choice to carve out a career\r\nin Egypt. He did so in the dark days when the outlook was the reverse\r\nof promising, in nearly every aspect, to a man of action. Abdication\r\nof our task of reconstruction was in the air, the withdrawal of the\r\nBritish army of occupation a much-talked-of calamity. Through every\r\nphase of the situation, Kitchener stuck to his guns, keeping to\r\nhimself his plans for the reconquest of the Soudan. He wrought and\r\nwatched while he waited, selecting and surrounding himself with able\r\nofficers, and exacting from each diligence and obedience in the\r\ndischarge of their duties. The Dongola campaign and the fortuitous one\r\nof the Atbara against Mahmoud greatly strengthened his position. There\r\nmight be further delay, but his triumphal entry into Omdurman and the\r\ndownfall of the Khalifa were certain. The Sirdar had but to ask, to\r\nreceive all the material and men he wished for. He adhered to his\r\nearly decision to employ only as many British troops as were actually\r\nnecessary to stiffen the Khedivial army, and no more.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle and victory of the Atbara in the spring, the British\r\ntroops, or Gatacre's brigade, marched back from Omdabiya by easy\r\nstages to the Nile. The wounded and sick were conveyed into the base\r\nhospital at Dakhala, whence they were afterwards sent down to\r\nGinenetta or, as it then was, Rail-head. From that point they were, as\r\neach case required, forwarded by train and steamboat to Wady Halfa and\r\nCairo. It was at Darmali, 12 miles or more north of Dakhala, that the\r\nBritish soldiers went into summer-quarters. On the 14th of April the\r\nbrigade mustered 3818 strong, made up as follows:--833 Camerons, 826\r\nSeaforths, 969 Lincolns, and 665 Warwicks. Two companies of Warwicks\r\nhad been left in the Dongola province when the advance was made.\r\nBesides the muster of battalions enumerated, the brigade included a\r\nMaxim battery, detachments of the Army Service Corps, and other\r\ndetails. The \"Tommies\" settled down in camp, living under peace\r\nconditions, for with the rout of Mahmoud's men, the nearest dervish\r\nforce worth considering was as far off as Shabluka Cataract. Everybody\r\nwas bidden to make himself as snug as possible. Outlying houses and\r\nwalls were thrown down to secure a free circulation of air. As for\r\nsunlight, that was shut out wherever practicable. The first home\r\ndrafts to make up for losses arrived at Darmali on the 23rd of April.\r\nAbout 130 men then joined. It was thought desirable to maintain the\r\nBritish battalions at their full strength, and some of them mustered\r\nnearly one thousand strong. As the percentage of sick was continuous,\r\nand the rate increased as the campaign progressed, the actual roll of\r\nmen \"fit for duty\" grew less as we neared Omdurman. Of course,\r\n\"youths,\" and all the \"weedy ones,\" were in the first instance\r\nrejected by the army doctors, and were never permitted to go to the\r\nfront. Men over 25 years of age were preferred, and it so happened\r\nthat both the Grenadier Guards and the Northumberland Fusiliers had a\r\nhigh average of relatively old soldiers, and consequently few sick.\r\nFrom the end of April until the end of May, dull hot days in the\r\nSoudan, leave was granted to officers to run down to Alexandria and\r\nhave a \"blow\" at San Stefano, by the sea-side. There were quite a\r\nnumber of deaths in the brigade shortly after the men got into camp,\r\nthe customary reaction having set in on account of the exposure and\r\nstrain precedent to the victory of the Atbara. To reduce the numbers\r\nquartered at Darmali, the Lincolns and Warwicks, on the 19th of April,\r\nwere marched a mile farther north along the Nile, to Es Selim, where\r\nthey formed a separate encampment, the Camerons and Seaforths\r\nremaining at the first-named place. The average daily number of sick\r\nin the brigade at that period was 100 to 150. On one occasion there\r\nwere 190 men reported unfit for duty. Most of the cases were not of a\r\nserious nature, and the patients speedily recovered and returned to\r\ntheir places in the ranks. There was no lack of stores and even\r\ndainties at the camps, for supplies were carried up by caravan,\r\nescorted by Jaalin friendlies, from Berber and elsewhere. Much of the\r\nsickness in the army was probably due to the men recklessly drinking\r\nunboiled and unfiltered Nile water. At that season the river had sunk\r\ninto its narrowest bed, and there were backwashes and sluggish\r\nchannels full of light-green tinted water. More filters were procured,\r\nand extra care was taken with all the water used for domestic\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nIn May there were route marches twice a week, the brigade going off at\r\n5.30 a.m. and returning about 7.30 a.m., all in the cool of the\r\nmorning or such bearable temperature as there was in the 24 hours'\r\ndaily round in that month. During these exercises the troops had\r\nplenty of firing practice, being taught to blaze away at bushes, and\r\noccasionally at targets representing dervishes. In that way the\r\nremainder of the million of tip-filed Lee-Metford bullets were\r\ndisposed of, for it had been arranged that there was to be a new\r\ncartridge case for the Omdurman campaign. The latest pattern\r\n\"man-stopper\" was a bullet fashioned with a hollow or crater at the\r\npoint, the nickel casing being perforated.\r\n\r\nSo the days droned past for the British soldiers, with little to do\r\nbeyond essaying the impossible of trying to keep cool. It was often\r\notherwise with the Egyptians, for they had to assist in getting the\r\nrailroad through to Dakhala from Ginenetta, in forwarding boats and\r\nstores, and later on in establishing wood stations and cutting fuel\r\nfor the steamers. The first of the tropical summer rain showers fell\r\nat Darmali on the 27th of May. On the 18th of June Major-General\r\nGatacre went off on a shooting excursion up the Atbara, taking with\r\nhim a party of ten officers and a few orderlies. They found relatively\r\nlittle big game but plenty of gazelle and birds. The bodies of the\r\nslain in Mahmoud's zereba at Omdabiya still lay where they fell,\r\nunburied, but dried up and mummified by the sun. Natives had stripped\r\nthe place and carried off everything left behind by us. A number of\r\ndervishes were seen lurking about, part of the defeated army of the\r\nenemy, who were afraid to return to Omdurman, anticipating that the\r\nKhalifa would have them killed. Indeed, it appeared that numbers of\r\nthe runaways had settled down at New Hilgi, and were attempting to\r\ncultivate. As for the four or five thousand dervish cavalry that\r\nMahmoud had with him, they also never returned to Omdurman. Quite\r\nprobably they made their way back to their original homes in small\r\nbands, rightly believing that Mahdism was doomed. Assured of pardon\r\nand good treatment at our hands, fourteen of the Mahdists and a number\r\nof women came in with General Gatacre's people. No attempt was made by\r\nthe dervishes in the neighbourhood to \"snipe\" the party. They returned\r\nto Darmali on the 27th of June. With the sun gone north came the\r\nrising of the Nile and fresh breezes. The gunboats kept diligently\r\npatrolling the river, watching for any signs of movement on the part\r\nof the Khalifa and his forces. The enemy were reported to be gathering\r\nin large numbers at Omdurman for the coming conflict. As Shendy was\r\nheld by a small force of Egyptians, and Metemmeh nominally by the\r\nJaalin for us, frequent visits were made to those posts. Later on,\r\nother shooting parties went up to Omdabiya and found that there was an\r\nincrease in the numbers of natives about, and that flocks and herds\r\nwere to be seen grazing in the vicinity. The tribesmen showed that\r\nthey had abandoned the Khalifa by tearing the dervish patches off\r\ntheir clothing. All being quiet, and peace assured in the Dongola\r\nprovince, the two detached companies of the Warwickshire left Korti\r\nand joined their comrades in Es Selim camp.\r\n\r\nJuly was a very busy month. The river flotilla and transport service\r\nhad all to be thoroughly organised for the impending advance. Gunboats\r\nreceived the final touches and completed their armament. The steamers,\r\nbarges and giassas, native sailing craft, underwent thorough repair.\r\nMore and still more munitions of war and provisions were sent forward\r\nand stored at Dakhala. That post grew into a formidable camp. The\r\nthree new twin-screw gunboats built on the Thames, besides other\r\nship-work reconstruction, were put together near Abadia, a village\r\nabove the Fifth Cataract and north of Berber. The railroad had been\r\nhastily laid and completed to Abadia after the battle of Atbara.\r\nThither the sections of the barges and steamers needed for the\r\ncampaign had been sent by rail from Wady Halfa. Before that date,\r\nengineering and other workshops had been erected at Abadia, which,\r\nbecause of its favourable position, was chosen for a permanent camp\r\nand industrial centre. Base-hospitals, too, were built there, in order\r\nthat the wounded and sick might travel as far as possible by water.\r\nAstonishing as had been the rapidity with which the Wady Halfa Abu\r\nHamid portion of the desert railroad was laid, smarter work still was\r\ndone carrying the line through to the Atbara. The utmost energy was\r\nput forth, after the defeat of Mahmoud, by the Director of Railways,\r\nMajor Girouard, R.E., to get the track completed to Dakhala, the\r\njunction of the Atbara with the Nile. Not only the railroad battalion,\r\nwhich was nearly 3000 strong, but every available Khedivial soldier,\r\nlaboured in some way or other at the task. They put their hearts and\r\nthews to the toil, for it was recognised that its completion not only\r\nsolved the transport problem, but was a swift and sure means of return\r\nto Egypt. The railroad battalion worked wonders in grading and laying.\r\nFellaheen and negro, they showed a vim and intelligence in\r\ntrack-making that Europeans could not surpass. Native lads, some in\r\ntheir early teens, clothed with little beyond a sense of their own\r\nimportance and \"army ammunition boots,\" many sizes too big for their\r\nfeet, adjusted the fish-plates and put on the screw nuts. Then, for\r\nthose who bore the heavy burden of rails and sleepers and carried\r\nmaterial for the road bed, there were licensed fools, mummers, and\r\ndroll mimics, who by their antics revived the lagging spirits of the\r\ngangs. There is an unsuspected capacity for mimicry in what are called\r\nsavage men. I have seen Red Indians give excellent pantomimic\r\nentertainments, and aborigines in other lands exhibit high mumming\r\ntalent. In the railroad battalion there was an eccentric negro who was\r\na very king of jesters. From the Sirdar and the Khalifa downwards--for\r\nhe was an ex-dervish and had played pranks in Omdurman--none escaped\r\na parodying portrayal of their mannerisms. He imitated the tones of\r\ntheir voice and twisted and contorted his face and body to resemble\r\nthe originals. Nothing was sacred from that mimic any more than from a\r\nsapper. He showed us Osman Digna's little ways, and gave ghastly\r\nimitations of trials, mutilations and executions by hanging in the\r\nMahdist camps. And these things were for relaxation, though maybe they\r\nserved as a reminder of the dervishes' brutal rule. There were\r\nvexations and jokes of another sort for Major Girouard and those held\r\ntightly responsible for the rapid construction and regular running of\r\nthe material trains, as indeed all trains were. When the line had been\r\nlaid beyond Abu Dis, for a time known as Rail-head, the camp and\r\nquarters were moved on to the next station. Abu Dis sank in dignity\r\nand population until only a corporal and two men were left to guard\r\nthe place and work the sidings. The desert railway being a single\r\ntrack, frequent sidings are indispensable for the better running of\r\ntrains. All the control for working the system was vested in the Wady\r\nHalfa officials. One night there came to them over the wires an\r\nalarmist message to send no more trains to Abu Dis. It was the\r\ncorporal who urgently rang up his chiefs. What could it mean? Had they\r\ndeserted, or, more likely, were the dervishes raiding the district? A\r\ndemand was made from Wady Halfa for the corporal to explain what had\r\nhappened. His answer was naive, if not satisfactory: \"The wild beasts\r\nhave come down from the hills, and we really cannot accept any trains\r\nfrom any direction.\" \"What do you mean?\" was again queried back. So\r\nthe corporal and his two men responded: \"Sir, there are wild beasts\r\nall around the hut and tent; what can we do? We dare not stir out.\"\r\n\"Light fires, you magnoons,\" (fools), was the final rejoinder, and the\r\ntrain service went forward as usual. It appeared that the hyenas and\r\nwolves, wont to snap up a living around the men's camp, bereft of\r\ntheir pickings were in a state of howling starvation, and had turned\r\nup and made an appeal, by no means mute, to the station guard, which\r\nthe latter failed to understand or appreciate. In a remarkably short\r\nspace of time the hyenas and pariah dogs had adopted the habit of\r\nscavengering around all the camps and snifting along the track, after\r\nthe trains, for stray scraps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DARMALI (BRITISH BRIGADE SUMMER QUARTERS).]\r\n\r\nI returned to Cairo early in July, where, having paid into the\r\nFinancial Military Secretary's hands the L50 security required of war\r\ncorrespondents, intended to cover cost of railway fares south of Wady\r\nHalfa, and for any forage drawn from the stores, I received the\r\nofficial permit to proceed to the front. All the restrictions as to\r\nthe number of correspondents allowed up, which were imposed during the\r\nAtbara campaign, were singularly enough removed, and the \"very open\r\ndoor\" policy substituted. In consequence, there was a large number,\r\nover sixteen in all, of so-called representatives of the press at the\r\nfront. As an old correspondent aptly observed, some of them\r\nrepresented anything but journals or journalism, the name of a\r\nnewspaper being used merely as a cover for notoriety and medal\r\nhunting. Having secured my warrant to join the Sirdar's army, I\r\nstarted from Cairo for Assouan and Wady Halfa. The headquarters at\r\nthat date were still in Wady Halfa. On the 21st of July the first\r\ndetachments of the reinforcements that were to make up the British\r\nforce to a division, which Major-General Gatacre was to command, left\r\nCairo for the south. Thereafter, nearly day by day up to the 9th of\r\nAugust inclusive, troops were sent forward. These consisted of\r\nartillery, cavalry, the 21st Lancers, baggage animals, Royal\r\nEngineers, Army Service Corps, Medical Corps, and the four battalions\r\nof infantry which were to form the second British brigade. The brigade\r\nin question comprised 1st Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the 1st\r\nNorthumberland Fusiliers, the 2nd Lancashire Fusiliers, and the 2nd\r\nBattalion Rifle Brigade, together with a battery of Maxims manned by a\r\ndetachment of the Royal Irish Fusiliers. Brigadier-General the\r\nHonourable N. G. Lyttelton, C.B., commanded the second brigade, whilst\r\nMajor-General Gatacre's former command, the 1st British Brigade, was\r\ntaken over by Brigadier-General J. Wauchope. The first brigade was\r\nmade up of the Lincolns, Warwicks, Seaforths, and Camerons, with six\r\nMaxims. To prepare for eventualities, and clench the special training\r\nhe had bestowed upon his men, Major-General Gatacre issued a printed\r\nslip of notes, or hints, to his men. I give the salient points of that\r\nproduction:--\r\n\r\n\"1. As the strength of a European force lies in the occupation of and\r\nin movement over open ground, which gives it advantage of fire, so the\r\nstrength of a dervish force lies in fighting in depressions of the\r\nground, or in a jungle country out of which they can pour suddenly and\r\nquickly their thousands of spear-armed warriors, who, unless checked\r\nby a murderous fire, constitute a grave danger, even to a perfectly\r\ndisciplined force.\r\n\r\n\"It follows, then, that a force halted for the night must always be\r\nprotected where possible by a zereba, which will check under fire the\r\nattacking dervishes.\r\n\r\n\"2. That a cleared zone be prepared along outer edge of the zereba.\r\n\r\n\"3. That a force, when moving, should march at a respectful distance\r\nfrom jungle cover.\r\n\r\n\"4. It should have the ground in its front and on its flanks searched\r\nout by cavalry, mounted infantry, or native levies.\r\n\r\n\"5. That when mounted troops have found the enemy, they must\r\ninvariably clear the front of the infantry to enable the latter to use\r\ntheir rifles.\r\n\r\n\"6. That brigades must be so trained that each battalion and\r\nindividual soldier must know how to get into the best formation with\r\nthe least possible delay for meeting the attack of the spearmen, who,\r\nit must be remembered, can move at least three times as quickly as a\r\nBritish soldier can double.\r\n\r\n\"To carry out the above, a high standard of training and steadiness is\r\nrequired, and battalions must be provided with a liberal supply of\r\ncutting tools, felling axes, hand axes and bill hooks to enable them,\r\nthe instant the battalion marches into bivouac, to cut down small\r\ntrees or strong branches of prickly trees with which to construct a\r\nthorn fence.\r\n\r\n\"Piquets must be withdrawn at dusk, otherwise they might get\r\nsurrounded and cut off, or, in falling back, would possibly suffer\r\nfrom the defenders of the zereba.\r\n\r\n\"The protection of the zereba against surprise must depend on the\r\nvigilance of its sentries and piquets which line the fence, and whose\r\nstrength will naturally depend on the proximity of the dervishes to\r\nthe force. With reliable information, and the ground properly\r\nreconnoitred, a patrol of ten men per company, patrolling constantly\r\nand noiselessly along the inner edge of the zereba, is adequate, so\r\nlong as the enemy's dem is say 15 miles distant (a day's march); when\r\nnearer than this, the strength of the piquets to remain awake and\r\nunder arms will depend upon the circumstances of the moment.\r\n\r\n\"All night duties of this nature should be found by companies, so that\r\nportions of the line along its whole length shall be on duty. Words of\r\ncommand and orders must be given in a low tone; there must be no\r\nshouting and no fires burning till the hour arrives for making the\r\nmorning tea. Men should always be allowed to smoke, but should be\r\nwarned of the danger of fire in zereba by a cigarette or match-end\r\nthrown into dry grass.\r\n\r\n\"Officers must sleep immediately behind their men; a certain number\r\nwill always be on duty.\r\n\r\n\"All, officers and men, must sleep in their clothes, boots and\r\naccoutrements, and each man must have his rifle with him. None but\r\nsentries' should be loaded, and bayonets should not be fixed, even by\r\nthe patrols, except when there is expectancy of attack. Under no\r\ncircumstances should men sleep with their bayonets fixed, or serious\r\naccidents will occur.\r\n\r\n\"And here, one word about 'alarms.' I do not refer to the assembly by\r\nbugle sound, but what is ordinarily called a panic, in other words a\r\ndisgraceful absence of discipline and self-control, which, while\r\nruining the reputation of the corps concerned as a reliable battalion,\r\nmay be the cause of serious mischief, and must be disastrous to the\r\nconfidence the General Officer places in its officers and men.\r\n\r\n\"One of the great advantages accruing to an army on service is the\r\nclose association of the officer with the man; each learns something\r\nfrom the other, and the officer will, in after years, appreciate the\r\nvalue of the habit he gets into of talking to his men and of storing\r\nup in his mind all sorts of dodges and hints, which assist troops in\r\nthe field to make themselves comfortable; more than this, it is in the\r\nfield only that the officer can get the opportunity of instilling into\r\nthe men's minds the necessity for deliberation under fire, the high\r\nstandard of the regiment, its past history, its superiority in\r\neverything to all other regiments in the division, and his confidence\r\nin his men to maintain such a standard of excellence. In many\r\nexpeditions it has happened that shots have been fired at nothing,\r\nnight after night, thus disturbing the whole force; such bad habits\r\nmust be firmly checked.\"\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Cairo I had the opportunity of witnessing a trial of\r\nthe new siege guns that were to be used in levelling the walls and\r\ndefences of Omdurman. To the eastward of Abbassieh barracks, near the\r\nrifle ranges, 150 feet of stone wall had been erected. It was a\r\nreplica of part of the structure which the Khalifa had built around\r\nthe tomb of the Mahdi, his own grounds, that of his body-guard, and\r\nthe more important buildings situated in the centre of the dervish\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nThe stout rectangular wall at Omdurman stood with its narrowest side\r\nfacing the Nile, and its longest sides ran inland from the river for\r\nabout a mile. It was twelve feet in height, and even more in places,\r\nten feet in thickness at the base, tapering to six feet at the top. It\r\nwas a well-made structure, laid in mortar and faced on either side\r\nwith dressed limestone blocks.\r\n\r\nShortly after six a.m. on the morning of 22nd July, a large number of\r\nofficers assembled at the Abbassieh ranges to watch the result of the\r\nexperiments of the sham bombardment. Lieutenant-General Sir Francis\r\nGrenfell and staff, Major-General Lyttelton, and many others were\r\npresent. It was arranged that the new 5-inch howitzer battery, with\r\nthe \"Lyddite\" or high explosive shells, was to make the first attempt\r\nto breach or throw down the wall. There were six of these new\r\nhowitzers, and they were worked by the 37th Field Battery, commanded\r\nby Major Elmslie. Except that the bore was larger, there was little to\r\ndistinguish the pieces from the 15-lb. Maxim-Nordenfeldt automatic\r\nrecoil guns used at the battle of the Atbara. The latter cannon,\r\nhowever, only used cordite, whereas the 5-inch howitzer shells are\r\nfilled with a picric compound resembling M. Turpin's melinite. For\r\nover ten years Russia has had 100-lb. howitzer batteries in the field,\r\nfiring high explosives. It was the Sirdar who insisted upon the\r\nnecessity of being supplied with these light and handy cannon. Neither\r\nthe velocity nor the range of their shell-fire is great, but it is\r\nenough--4000 yards or thereby--for all practical purposes, and is\r\nfairly accurate. The explosion of the picric shells was very violent,\r\nand the danger area about 300 yards from where they burst. It has been\r\nfound that, with about six or eight mules to draw the guns, the\r\nbattery was quite mobile. Egyptian drivers were employed, though the\r\nmen serving the guns were all British artillerymen. Even the drivers\r\nof the 32nd Field Battery, commanded by Major Williams, had \"gippy\"\r\nteamsters. Both batteries were drawn by smart Cyprus mules. The\r\nhowitzers opened fire at 750 yards from the wall. With few exceptions,\r\nthe Lyddite shells hit the mark. Range is given more by increase or\r\ndiminution of the charge than elevation or depression of the\r\nhowitzers. The guns kicked viciously and ran back at each discharge.\r\nBursting violently, the shells threw out big sheets of tawny flame,\r\nfollowed by showers of stones and a cloud of dust and brownish smoke.\r\nIt was possible to see the missiles in their flight and note where\r\nthey struck. As each shell rushed through the air it made a noise not\r\nunlike an express train passing under a bridge. There were salvoes of\r\ntwo or three guns, and huge chunks were knocked out of the wall.\r\nPieces of flying debris frequently dropped at no great distance from\r\nthe gunners. It was plain that the shells were bursting upon impact,\r\nand only blowing away the face of the wall to the depth of but a foot\r\nor two. Had there been thick shells with retarding fuses the structure\r\nmight have been breached in two or three rounds.\r\n\r\nAfter a preliminary ten rounds had been fired, the wall was closely\r\ninspected. It was seen that infantry might have clambered over the\r\ndebris to the top of the structure and jumped down upon the other\r\nside. A strange feature was that wherever the \"Lyddite\" explosive\r\nfailed to detonate the stones and ground around had been transformed\r\nto a deep chrome colour. The battery was moved closer, to about 350\r\nyards from the wall, and the firing was recommenced at that range.\r\nMuch better results were obtained, and the upper part of the wall was\r\nknocked away, and easy, practicable breaches made. One of the other\r\nadvantages of these new guns is that with reduced firing charges they\r\nbecome reliable mortars, and the high explosive shells can be dropped\r\nover a wall or building, so as to drive the defenders from their\r\nworks. Not a man would have escaped injury had there been an enemy\r\nbehind the wall, for blocks of stone were scattered in all directions.\r\nWhen the howitzers had finished their practice, six rounds were fired\r\nfrom two 40-lb. Armstrong guns, which were also ordered to assist in\r\nbreaching Omdurman's walls. Next to the 7-lb. screw guns the 40-lb.\r\nArmstrong is reputed to be the most accurate shooting cannon in the\r\nBritish service. Mounted on lofty carriages, these siege guns were\r\nlaid to fire at 800 yards range. Oddly enough, one of the 40-lbs.\r\nscored as high a percentage of misses as the howitzers. The great\r\nvelocity of the 40-lb. shells, filled with the slower-bursting\r\ngunpowder, carried them well into the part of the wall aimed at, with\r\nthe result that, in a few seconds, they made a good breach. The\r\nmorning's experiments were concluded by a detachment of the Royal\r\nIrish Fusiliers, under Captain Churches, firing their Maxims against\r\ntargets representing bands of dervishes, the dummy enemy being, as\r\nusual, riddled with bullets.\r\n\r\nFrom Cairo to Dakhala, evidence was not lacking that the form and\r\nmovement of preparations for the general advance were growing apace.\r\nEvery train and boat going south was overloaded with officers, men,\r\nand transport animals, together with munitions of war galore for the\r\ncampaign. The gunboats and deserters brought in reports that the\r\ndervishes were concentrating at Omdurman. The strongly defensible\r\npositions of Shabluka, together with the mud forts, had been evacuated\r\nby the dervishes. Very quickly the Sirdar sent small bodies of troops\r\nup stream to occupy suitable positions for wood-cutting and forming\r\nadvance camps. In that way the river pass at the Sixth Cataract was\r\nseized without the long anticipated fight for that difficult bit of\r\ncountry. The Nile highway was at length in the Sirdar's undisputed\r\npossession up to within thirty miles of Omdurman.\r\n\r\nThere is no dustier journey by rail, or one of an altogether more\r\nuncomfortable nature, than from Cairo to Shellal. It is bad enough in\r\nthe so-called winter season, for you have to breathe an atmosphere of\r\ndust the whole way, and are powdered and almost suffocated before you\r\nreach Luxor. The same trip taken in midsummer, in the stuffy, crowded\r\ncarriages of the Egyptian lines, is real martyrdom, or something akin\r\nthereto. High speed or over twenty-five miles an hour is not\r\nattempted. Although the journey ordinarily occupies thirty-two hours,\r\nI was forty hours _en route_. There are no refreshment-bars or\r\nrestaurants for the supply of palatable food or drink for the fierce\r\nneeds of the passengers. I made some provision for the trip, and\r\nmanaged to survive it, as I have done before, but I cannot forget its\r\ntortures any more than the newest of new-comers. Not until we reached\r\nAssouan could we secure a fair supply of water and get a bath and an\r\nenjoyable meal. That same afternoon, I, with three other\r\ncorrespondents, was allowed to take passage on barge No. 9, which,\r\nwith two giassas, was taken in tow up to Wady Halfa by a sternwheeler.\r\nAmong others proceeding on the craft to join the army were\r\nMajor-General Wauchope and Surgeon-General Taylor, and a number of\r\nother army medicoes, fresh in their new dignity as officers of the\r\n\"Royal Army Medical Corps.\" Under the instruction of Surgeon-General\r\nTaylor, Surgeon-Major Wilson was good enough to present each of us\r\nwith a packet of first field dressings, a kindness which I\r\nappreciated, but of which I hoped not to have need.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUP OF STAFF OFFICERS.--COLONEL WINGATE IN CENTRE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMUSTERING FOR THE OVERTHROW OF MAHDISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nA hackneyism lacks the picturesqueness of originality, but is as\r\nuseful in its way as a public road to a desired destination. The\r\nquotation which I am at the moment anxious to make use of is, \"The\r\nmills of the gods grind slowly, but they grind exceeding small.\" Time\r\nthe avenger had all but fulfilled the meed of punishment for the evil\r\nday of 26th January 1885, when the streets of Khartoum ran with blood,\r\nand the headless body of General Gordon was left to be hacked and hewn\r\nby ferocious hordes of dervishes. Major-General Sir Herbert H.\r\nKitchener had so managed that the decisive blow should be delivered in\r\nthe most effective manner. Stage by stage he had moved forward and\r\nimproved his lines of communication. The advanced base, or point of\r\ndeparture for the campaign, was no longer Wady Halfa, or Korti in the\r\nprovince of Dongola, as in 1884, but Dakhala. Nay, with the\r\nunassailable power and command of the Nile his flotilla gave him, it\r\nmight be said the real base of the Sirdar's army was where he chose to\r\nfix it, even hard by Omdurman. As for the Khalifa, ruined to some\r\nextent by years of successes and easy victories, he was committing the\r\nfatal military error of over-confidence. He had drawn around him from\r\nall parts of the Soudan the best of his trusty warriors, the pick of\r\nthe fighting tribes of Africa. The leaders were mostly sheiks who were\r\ntoo far committed to hope for pardon and restoration, in the event of\r\ndefeat, from the Khedivial Government. Besides, there were still\r\nplenty of ignorant fanatics amongst the chosen \"Ansar,\" or servants of\r\nGod, to fire the naturally truculent mass of armed men.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the smashing of the Mahdists, the Sirdar was leading the\r\nlargest and best equipped expedition ever seen south of Wady Halfa.\r\nThe river flotilla comprised eleven well-armed steam gunboats. For the\r\ntransport of troops and stores beyond Dakhala he had numberless native\r\ncraft, giassas, nuggars, several steamers, and specially constructed\r\niron barges. What with their crews and detachments of British gunners,\r\nengineers, and infantry, each gunboat had a fighting force of about\r\n100 men aboard. These vessels could easily have carried many more\r\nhands; indeed, the newest type of Nile men-o'-war, the twin-screw\r\nsteamers, were built to convey a thousand soldiers. The land forces\r\nincluded over 8000 British troops and fully 15,000 Egyptian and\r\nSoudanese soldiery. In artillery the army was exceptionally strong.\r\nLieut.-Colonel C. J. Long, R.A., commanding that arm, had practically\r\neight batteries and ten Maxims at his disposal, not counting the\r\nmachine guns, Maxims, attached to the British division. The artillery\r\nincluded the 32nd Field Battery R.A. of six 15-pounders under Major\r\nWilliams; the 37th Field Battery R.A. of six 5-inch howitzers under\r\nMajor Elmslie, and two 40-pounders R.A. Armstrong guns under Lieut.\r\nWeymouth. There were also, No. 1 Egyptian Horse Artillery Battery\r\n(Krupps) under Major Young, R.A., of six guns; No. 2 Egyptian Field\r\n(mule) Battery under Major Peake, consisting of six 12 1/2-pounder\r\nMaxim-Nordenfeldt automatic recoil guns, firing when necessary a\r\ndouble shell, and Egyptian Field Batteries Nos. 3, 4, and 5, each of\r\nsix of the same type of guns, under Captain C. G. Stewart, R.A., Major\r\nLawrie, R.A., and Major de Rougemont, R.A., and two 6-centimetres\r\nKrupps on mules. The ten Maxims, or at least six of them, were mounted\r\nupon galloping carriages drawn by horses. On these vehicles or limbers\r\nthe gunners could remain in position and bring the weapons into action\r\nat any moment. Captain Franks had the control of these machine guns,\r\ntwo of which were, nominally, attached to each Egyptian battery.\r\nBesides the four brigades of Khedivial infantry, together with\r\nartillery, cavalry, and camelry, and minor details, the Egyptian army\r\nalso included a large transport column of some 2800 camels and about\r\nas many men.\r\n\r\nA new solar-hat, a poke-bonnet sort of head-gear, was designed and\r\ntied on the pates of one thousand transport camels as an experiment to\r\nprevent sickness and sunstroke. Although the brutes have the smallest\r\nmodicum of brains, they are very liable to attacks of illness from\r\nheat-exhaustion. That they are born in the tropics confers no\r\nimmunity. Strange to say, on the march south from Assouan, of a\r\nthousand and odd only one animal succumbed to sunstroke, and that was\r\na camel that had no sun-bonnet. If anything could have added to the\r\nnaturally lugubrious expression of those lumbering freight carriers,\r\nit was the jaunty poke-bonnets with the attenuated \"Oh, let us be\r\njoyful\" visages grinning beneath. The transport department was managed\r\nby Colonel F. W. Kitchener, brother of the Sirdar. His care it was,\r\nwhen the army actually took the field, to see that the supplies of\r\nfood, forage, and ammunition advanced with the columns. As a matter of\r\nfact, in that respect the campaign, as at the Atbara, was admirably\r\nordered, and the troops lacked for nothing in reason. There were few\r\nmules and donkeys employed in the baggage trains, the bulk of the\r\nstores being camel-borne. It was the free and full use of water\r\ntransport, by the Nile, that enabled supplies to be sent on rapidly\r\nand regularly with the army when the troops advanced beyond Rail-head.\r\nBesides the regular army which was to proceed up the left or west bank\r\nand attack Omdurman, there was a column of armed friendlies who were\r\nto operate against the dervishes quartered between Shendy and\r\nKhartoum, by the east or right bank of the Nile. Nor were the bands of\r\ntribesmen upon that shore the only auxiliaries who had volunteered to\r\nassist in overthrowing Mahdism. Jaalin scouts and runners put\r\nthemselves under the Sirdar's orders to scour the front and flanks of\r\nthe army, at least up to Kerreri. Colonel Parsons, R.A., was to lead\r\na mixed force of fellaheen soldiers, Abyssinian levies, ex-Italian\r\nAscari, and Arabs from Kassala to attack Gedarif and menace Khartoum\r\nfrom the east.\r\n\r\nThere was a degree of soreness in several British battalions at not\r\nbeing allowed to bear part in the campaign. The troops forming the\r\nArmy of Occupation believed that they should have had the first call.\r\nAmong these were the Royal Irish Fusiliers. It had been anticipated\r\nthat as they were next on the army list for active foreign service,\r\nthey would certainly not be passed over. Instead of receiving orders\r\nto march, they were left severely alone, another Fusilier battalion\r\nbeing sent in their place. The proceeding gave rise to much bickering\r\nand bitterness in certain quarters. An attempt, I believe, was made to\r\nsend half of the Royal Irish Fusiliers to the front, but that fell\r\nthrough owing to various causes. According to the War Office\r\nrequirements, the Royal Irish Fusiliers were not in a satisfactory\r\ncondition. There were serious drawbacks which would have terribly\r\nmilitated against the effective employment of the battalion as a\r\nfirst-class fighting unit. Individually, the men were all right, but\r\nthe battalion record in certain respects was held to be very faulty. I\r\nhave no wish to cavil at the War Office authorities' honest desire to\r\nserve the public and yet temper their judgment with mercy to\r\nindividuals. But the case was one where they should not have\r\ntemporised in any way. As matters turned out, the Royal Irish\r\nFusiliers were very angry at being passed over at the eleventh hour\r\nfor another regiment. For several generations they have never had a\r\nchance of being in action. They were fairly spoiling for a fight, and\r\nit was hard, at the last moment, to have the road to glory closed in\r\ntheir faces for the deficiencies of the few.\r\n\r\nHe whom Arabs and blacks of the whole Soudan call the \"Grand Master of\r\nthe Art of Flight,\" our old friend Osman Digna, was with the Khalifa\r\nin Omdurman. Osman was wily and experienced, and his counsel, had it\r\nbeen listened to by his chief, would have added to the difficulties of\r\ncarrying the Mahdist stronghold by assault. I have some knowledge of\r\nthat astute ex-slavedealer and trader's ways in the Eastern Soudan and\r\nelsewhere. He, many years ago, even condescended to honour me with his\r\ncorrespondence and an invitation to join the true believers, _i.e._,\r\nthe Mahdists. I have no doubt he meant well, but the land and the\r\ndervishes were alike abhorrent to me. Osman had quietly come to the\r\nwise conclusion that Mahdism was near its end. With his usual\r\nprescience he made his own arrangements without consulting the\r\nKhalifa. Early in the year he had all his women and children and such\r\nwealth as he could smuggle out of the country sent over to Jeddah.\r\nThere his family are now living under the protection of some of his\r\nold friends and kinsmen. When Omdurman fell he had no intention, the\r\nHadendowas said, of sharing the Khalifa's further fortunes in hiding\r\namong the wilds of Kordofan. He would instead try and escape across\r\nthe Red Sea and rejoin his family. The Arab clansmen are like the\r\nHielan' caterans; they may fight and quarrel with one another, but\r\nunless there is a blood feud it is unlikely they will help either the\r\nEnglish or the Egyptians to bag old Osman Digna. If the Turk gets him\r\nfor a subject, well, the Sublime Porte is likely to be deeply sorry\r\nfor it later on. \"Fresh troubles in Yemen,\" or elsewhere in the\r\nArabian Peninsula, will be amongst the headlines of news from that\r\nquarter once Osman the plotter finds his feet again after his last\r\nflight. After the Atbara he just missed being taken by the skin of his\r\nteeth, so to speak. His camp letters and private correspondence were\r\nall secured. It was in this way: When the news of the Atbara victory\r\nreached Kassala, Captain Benson and a party of about 200 Abyssinian\r\nirregulars set out to see whether Osman Digna and his more immediate\r\nfollowers were not trying to make their way back to Omdurman, via\r\nAderamat and Abu Delek. It may be recollected that the fugitive Shiekh\r\nhad established a camp at the last-named place after he had been\r\ndriven out of the Eastern Soudan. Sure enough, Captain Benson and the\r\nirregulars came up with Osman Digna and 400 of his people encamped\r\nnear the Atbara. They called on them to surrender, but that they would\r\nnot do. A running fight began, in the course of which Osman, his\r\nnephew Mousa and many more escaped. The Abyssinians, however, killed\r\nand captured over 200 of the dervish leader's followers, and returned\r\nin triumph with the captives and spoils. I am told that Mousa Digna,\r\nthough he watched the fight in question, never fired a shot. The tale\r\ngoes, that he has never drawn sword or trigger against us since we\r\ngave him his life at the battle of Gemaizeh, near Suakin. That\r\nmorning I found Mousa, shot through the stomach, reclining upon the\r\nground. He was still truculent, and brandishing his spear. The\r\nSoudanese were anxious to despatch him forthwith, and fired several\r\nshots at him, the aim of which I spoiled by direct interference. I had\r\neven then difficulty in getting Mousa to lie down quietly, having to\r\nshow him my revolver. Finally, he partly realised the situation. He\r\nwas taken up, carried into Suakin, carefully attended to, fed upon a\r\nmilk diet, and, in the end, recovered and returned to his Uncle Osman\r\nand the dervishes. It has always been upon my mind that I was therein\r\ninstrumental in furnishing a dervish recruit to the cause of furious\r\nanarchy, and I am relieved to think Mousa is not without compunction,\r\nif not a decent modicum of conscience. But your proper Hadendowa is\r\nnot a Baggara.\r\n\r\n\"Three removals are worse than a fire,\" and it is much the same in\r\ncampaigning. Constant trudging to and fro, making and breaking camps\r\nwith the hardships of marches and raw ground for bivouacs, furnish a\r\nbigger mortality bill than an ordinary battle. One of the smart things\r\ndone by the Sirdar, which served to show that he had closely knit all\r\nthe ends of the new frontier lines together, was to bring troops up\r\nfrom the Dongola province and the Red Sea Littoral, to swell the\r\nstrength of his army in the field. The 5th Egyptian battalion under\r\nColonel Abd El Borham marched across from Suakin to Berber in eighteen\r\ndays. It was not by any means sought to make it a forced march. The\r\nFifth was accompanied by a company, 100 men and animals, of the Camel\r\nCorps and had 40 baggage camels for ordinary transport. Leisurely, day\r\nby day, they tramped along over the 250 odd miles of rock and sand\r\nthat intervene betwixt the Nile and the sea. Hadendowa and Bishaim\r\ntribesmen were friendly, and scouts led them in the best tracks\r\nwhether they tramped by night or by day. At one place they had to make\r\na long forced march as the water in the wells had been exhausted by a\r\nprevious caravan. In time to come, with a little outlay, new wells\r\nwill be dug and an abundant supply of water provided along the whole\r\nroute. Later on, the 5th Egyptian battalion marched up from Berber to\r\nDakhala camp. The men were tall, muscular fellaheen. They were, as has\r\nbecome the custom in Egypt since the army has been officered by the\r\nQueen's soldiers, played into quarters on this occasion by a native\r\nSoudanese band to the swinging tune of \"O, dem Golden Slippers.\"\r\n\r\nIt is warm enough in Lower Egypt in July to be uncomfortable, and to\r\nturn the most obdurate into a melting mood. Assouan has the deserved\r\nreputation of being hotter in that month than Aden, the Persian Gulf,\r\nor--well, any other hot place. So, as I have said before, the British\r\ntroops were not required to do more than the minimum of duty at that\r\nperiod. Decidedly \"circumstances alter cases,\" even in matters\r\nmilitary. I hope I may be pardoned for these recurring quotations and\r\nsaws. The intolerably fervent solar heat of the Soudan at that season\r\ndid not admit of much originality in thought, expression, or act. One\r\nof my companions was a veritable modern Sancho Panza, and in one's\r\nlimp, mental, noontide condition his sapient \"instances\" were\r\ncatching. When he left Cairo, as he confided to me, though it was warm\r\nenough there, he decided not to buy too thin clothing lest he might\r\ncatch cold. He therefore purchased articles that even in England would\r\nbe called woolly and comfortable. Later on, as he reclined upon his\r\ncouch in a thrice-raised Turkish bath temperature, he lamented that he\r\n\"could not catch cold\" even in a state of nature or next to it. He no\r\nlonger wondered at Sydney Smith's wish to sit in his bones, and\r\nthought that expression would have acquired additional force if the\r\nwitty divine had added \"packed in ice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nBY THE WAY--FROM CAIRO TO DAKHALA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen days from London to the junction of the Atbara with the Nile: so\r\nfar from England and yet so near. By-and-by, no doubt, the Brindisi\r\nmail, speeding in connection with the Khartoum express, will make the\r\nrun in seven or eight days. From England to Port Said is now but a\r\nmatter of four days by the new Peninsular and Oriental service. It\r\ntook me six days from Cairo to reach Dakhala. The officials prefer to\r\nknow the place as \"Atbara Camp.\" There is no absolute rule for the\r\nbestowal of proper names, or at least no practice one need care about\r\nin the Soudan, so I prefer to dub the locality by its native title of\r\nDakhala, or Dakhelha. It saves a word in telegraphing, and there is\r\nmore fitness in calling that dusty, dirty enclosure by the less\r\neuphonious name.\r\n\r\nOne could not but note what a wondrous change in the military and\r\npolitical situation had been wrought in the land since 1884-85.\r\nRailways had solved every difficulty of dealing with the dervishes.\r\nQuite easily nowadays the remote provinces of the whilom great\r\nEgyptian equatorial empire can be reached and governed. With ordinary\r\ncare under the altered conditions millions of Arabs and blacks can be\r\ntransformed from chronic-rebellious into trusty loyal subjects. There\r\nhas been bloodguiltiness and to spare in the Soudan since 1883-84,\r\ntherefore the rehabilitation of the country through the setting up of\r\njust government will be in the nature of discharging a duty long\r\nincumbent upon Great Britain. From the Atbara southward, the Niles and\r\ntheir tributaries are open to steam navigation the year round. The\r\npossession of these noble waterways, which extend over thousands of\r\nmiles, includes the fee-simple of sovereignty in the fertile lands of\r\nthe two Nile basins and their commerce. By admirable foresight and\r\nindomitable Anglo-Saxon persistence the Sirdar had achieved a unique\r\nposition in African conquest. He had got together an armed force \"fit\r\nto go anywhere and to do anything.\" The heart of Africa was his, to\r\nloose or to bind. Of all the terrible railway rides in the world, for\r\ndirt and discomfort, none compares with the trip from Cairo to Luxor\r\nand Assouan. The carriages are stuffy and unclean, and during the\r\nwhole journey one stifles in an opaque atmosphere of grit mixed with\r\nthe sweepings of the ages. The calcined earths quickly cushion the\r\nseats, powder you from head to foot, and fill your pockets and every\r\nother receptacle with soil enough to make you feel like a landed\r\nproprietor--or, at any rate, rich enough in loam to lay out a suburban\r\ngarden. With all the accessories at hand for the creation of an acrid\r\nand measureless thirst, neither the railway authorities nor private\r\nenterprise have had the wit as yet to provide travellers with the\r\nmeans of mitigating their sufferings. It is little short of a horror\r\nto think of that journey of over forty hours' duration, which had to\r\nbe endured without the succour to be found in a refreshment-room\r\nwhere, for a consideration, could be got a sparkling cool drink or a\r\nmouthful of passable victuals. Were it to take me a month to travel\r\nthe distance by river, if time permitted I had rather adventure next\r\ntime upon the Nile than ever go by train over that line again. I\r\nconfess I have made the journey by rail frequently but it becomes\r\nreally more unendurable each trip. Of course I laid in stores of\r\nliquids and solids for the voyage. I ought to have known better, but\r\none thinks nothing of the toothache when it is past. The mineral\r\nwaters became too hot to drink, and not quite near enough the\r\nboiling-point to make good tea of, whilst, as for the provisions, such\r\nas got not too high, were so swathed in layers of questionable dust\r\nand grit as to be repulsive. Keeping even passably tidy was\r\nimpossible, and in personal cleanliness a London scavenger could give\r\na traveller by rail from Cairo to Assouan many points. It was at Wady\r\nHalfa that I got booked in the way-bill for Dakhala, or Atbara Camp,\r\n390 miles away. The construction of the Halfa-Atbara line was, as I\r\nhave said before, a masterpiece of military strategy, the credit for\r\nwhich is due to the Sirdar. By-and-by a railway bridge will span the\r\nAtbara at Dakhala, and the iron way will be laid into Khartoum. The\r\n170 miles betwixt the Atbara and Khartoum offer no difficulties, and\r\nthe line will be laid within a year from the time when the money is\r\ngranted the Sirdar for its construction.\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing was written, the requisite amount has been voted\r\nLord Kitchener of Khartoum, and the contracts for material have been\r\nissued and signed. About a quarter of a million sleepers have to be\r\ndelivered in Egypt before the end of June 1899. The Atbara and forty\r\nsmall khors will be bridged, and the work be completed in twelve\r\nmonths. It is intended that the terminus shall be on the east bank\r\nopposite Khartoum.\r\n\r\nAll the trains on the Halfa-Atbara line carried goods, ordinary\r\npassengers being incidental. Four of my colleagues, Major Sitwell, of\r\nthe Egyptian army, and myself got places in a horse-box. In the next\r\ntruck to us, likewise a horse-box, were five English officers,\r\nreturning to duty with Gatacre's, or rather Wauchope's, brigade at\r\nDarmali. In that same horse-box truck we five contrived to cook, eat,\r\nsleep, and dress for two round days, for, as I have stated, there were\r\nno restaurants or buffets within 1000 miles of the desert railway. The\r\nwayside stations were but sidings or halting-places where the\r\nlocomotives drew coal and water, of which small supplies were usually\r\nstored under an Egyptian corporal's guard. Ours was a long and heavy\r\ntrain, and more than once on the up grade to No. 6 or Summit station\r\nout from Halfa the engine came to a standstill, \"to recover its\r\nbreath,\" as the negroes said. In the horse-box we got along together\r\nfor the most part very comfortably, accommodating ourselves to the\r\nsituation. Such a picnic as we had then made it less of a puzzle to\r\nthe common understanding how certain creatures are able to do with a\r\ntight-fitting shell for their house and home. If Major Girouard, R.E.,\r\nhad not left the direction of the Soudan military railways--which\r\nunder the Sirdar he built--to join the Board of the Egyptian lines, we\r\nshould, I believe, have had better provision made for passengers.\r\nZiehs, or porous native clay-jars to hold cool drinking water, and\r\nvarious other little accessories to lighten the hardships of the trip\r\nwould surely have been provided. Later on, the officials took care to\r\nhave ziehs and plenty of cool drinking water in the carriages and\r\ntrucks of all trains carrying troops, so that the men had at least\r\nplenty to drink.\r\n\r\nOn our way up we passed Wauchope's brigade encamped at Es Selim and\r\nDarmali. Colonel Macdonald's 1st and Colonel Maxwell's 2nd Khedivial\r\nBrigades started to march from Berber to Dakhala about that time, the\r\nend of July. Many of the British soldiers, so as not to sleep upon the\r\nground, had built for themselves benches of mud or sun-dried bricks,\r\nwhereon they spread their blankets. The plan secured some immunity\r\nfrom such crawling things as scorpions and snakes. Sun-baked mud in\r\nthe Soudan is a hard and decently clean material for bench or bed. The\r\nTheatres Royal, Darmali and Es Selim, were in full swing, though it\r\nwas very 'dog-days' weather. Officers liberally patronised the men's\r\nentertainments and occasionally held jollifications of their own.\r\nThere were a good many who exercised the cheerful spirit of Mark\r\nTapley under the trials of the Soudan. Lively and original skits and\r\nverses were given at these symposiums. Here are a few verses of a\r\ntopical song on the refractory blacks and fellaheen fallen under the\r\ncondemnation of either the civil or military law and forced to hard\r\nlabour. It was written and frequently sung by a clever young engineer\r\nofficer:--\r\n\r\n    We're convicts at work in the Noozle,\r\n      We carry great loads on our backs,\r\n    And often our warders bamboozle,\r\n      And sleep 'neath mountains of sacks.\r\n\r\n                                Chorus: Ri-tooral il looral, &c.\r\n\r\n(The Noozle is the commissariat depot.)\r\n\r\n    We convicts start work at day dawning,\r\n      Boilers we mount about noon,\r\n    Sleepers we load in the morning,\r\n      And rails by the light of the moon.\r\n\r\n    Our warders are blacks, who cry Masha! (march),\r\n      And strike us if we don't obey,\r\n    Or else he's a Hamla Ombashi,\r\n      Who allows us to fuddle all day.\r\n\r\nHamla Ombashi is a corporal of the transport service, and \"fuddle\" is\r\nto sit down. It was the chorus with spoken words interlarded that\r\ncaught on astonishingly, and showed that the men's lungs were in\r\nmagnificent condition. Another howler, but by another author, was\r\n\"Roll on to Khartoum.\" Here is a specimen verse and the chorus:--\r\n\r\n    Come, forward march, and do your duty,\r\n      Though poor your grub, no rum, bad 'bacca,\r\n    Step out, for fighting and no booty,\r\n      To trace a free red line thro' Africa.\r\n\r\n    No barney, boys, give over mousing,\r\n      True Britons are ye from hill and fen,\r\n    Now rally lads, and drop all grousing,\r\n      And pull together like soldier-men.\r\n\r\n                                Chorus.\r\n\r\n    Then roll on, boys, roll on to Khartoum,\r\n      March ye and fight by night or by day,\r\n    Hasten the hour of the Dervishes' doom,\r\n      Gordon avenge in old England's way.\r\n\r\n\"Grousing\" is Tommy Atkins for grumbling, which is an Englishman's\r\nbirthright. As for no rum, subsequently the men were allowed two tots\r\na week; Wednesdays and Saturdays were, I think, the days of issue.\r\nLess than half a gill was each man's share. I am inclined to believe\r\nhad there been a daily issue of the same quantity of rum it had been\r\nbetter, and the young soldiers might have escaped with less fever.\r\n\r\nDakhala had undergone many changes since March. It was bigger in every\r\nrespect, but no better as a camping-ground. Truth to tell, it was so\r\nbad as to be well-nigh intolerable. The correspondents' quarters were\r\nexceptionally vile, the location being the worst possible within the\r\nlines. We had no option, and so had to pitch our tents behind the\r\nnoozle in a ten-acre waste of dirtiest, lightest loam, which swished\r\naround in clouds by day and night, making us grimy as coal-heavers,\r\npowdering everything, even our food and drink, with gritty dust and\r\ncovering us in our blankets inches deep. The river breeze was barred\r\nfrom us, and the green and fresher banks of the Atbara and the Nile,\r\nbeyond the fort, were for other than correspondents' camps. Many rows\r\nof mud huts had been built in the interior. As for the sun-dried brick\r\nparapets and ramparts of the fortifications, these were already\r\ncrumbling to ruin or being cast down for use in newer structures. The\r\nlofty wooden lookout staging, called the Eiffel Tower, had been\r\nremoved, and its timbers converted to other purposes. On the\r\ncompletion of the railway to Dakhala, Abadia had become but a\r\nsecondary workshop centre. Newer and larger shipbuilding yards and\r\nengine works were erected by the Atbara. Under Lieutenant Bond, R.N.,\r\nand Mr Haig gunboats, steamers, barges and sailing craft were put in\r\nthorough order, native artisans toiling day and night. The clang of\r\nhammermen, riveters, carpenters and caulkers resounded along the river\r\nfront. The Dakhala noozle was an immense depot, stuffed full of grain,\r\nprovisions, ammunition boxes, ropes, wires, iron, medical stores and\r\nother material, like one of the great London docks. As usual the\r\nindefatigable Greek trader had adventured upon the scene. North of the\r\nfortified lines, with the help of the natives he had run up a mud\r\ntown. It consisted of a double row of one-storeyed houses, between\r\nwhich ran a street of nearly 300 yards. The place, known as the\r\nbazaar, was a hive of stores, wretched cafes, and the like. As the\r\nSirdar had had all the beer and liquor in the place seized and put\r\nunder seal before the advent of Mr T. Atkins, there was little to be\r\nhad in Dakhala bazaar besides a not too pure soda-water, coffee,\r\nsardines, beans, maccaroni, oil, tobacco and matches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STREET IN DAKHALA.]\r\n\r\nFor six weeks southerly winds blew almost daily. South of 17 degrees,\r\nthe northerly breeze does not commence to blow before the end of\r\nAugust. It was warm, extremely warm, under the burning tropical sun.\r\nThe heat bore down like a load upon head and shoulders and enveloped\r\nus like a blast from a roaring furnace. About noontide it was\r\nordinarily 120 degrees Fahr. in my tent. Still, I am sure it was by no\r\nmeans so oppressive as at Korti in March 1885. The Atbara and the Nile\r\nhelped to temper the fiery glow that radiated from the desert rocks\r\nand sands. At best, the heat is a sore trial, but to be borne with\r\nmore patience than the \"devils\" and sand storms that bother by night\r\nas well as by day. Snow-drifts are mild visitations of Providence\r\ncompared with a dust storm or whirlwind. These latter would smother\r\nyou, if you would let them, quicker and less respectably than a shroud\r\nof snow. Jack Frost bites mildly, preferring to do his serious work by\r\ndulling the nerves; but the Dust Devil is a cruel tormentor from first\r\nto last. You may bury your head in folds of cloth and mosquito\r\nnetting, and sweat and stifle in the attempt, but he snuffs you and\r\npowders you all the same. He puffs his finest clouds in your face, and\r\nround and round you till you find bedding and clothing are no more\r\nprotection against him than they are against the Roentgen ray. One\r\nparticular night he came in great strength to Dakhala, heaped waves of\r\nsand over us, dug great hollows around our quarters, and completed his\r\ndiabolical games by completely overturning two of my colleagues'\r\ntents. I saw my friends emerge from the ruins of canvas, bedding, and\r\nboxes, wild, half-clad, terra-cotta figures, such as may have escaped\r\nfrom the destruction of Pompeii. But the human mind is a curious\r\nthing. It does not acknowledge defeat easily, and so a victim said to\r\nme he had pulled his tent down to keep it from falling. The Dust Devil\r\nhad nothing to do with it.\r\n\r\nEarly in August the situation assumed a peculiar interest to us of the\r\nfourth estate. We were told that the troops were shortly going forward\r\nto rendezvous at Nasri Island, whereas it was a matter of notoriety\r\nthat Wad Habeshi, which was further south, had been selected as the\r\nadvanced camp for the army on leaving Dakhala. Of course, not one word\r\nof the true state of matters were we permitted to wire home.\r\nDetachments, true enough, had been sent ahead to \"cut wood\" and set up\r\na camp upon Nasri Island. But that was merely to have a secure\r\nsecondary depot and hospital station. It had been ascertained after\r\nthe occupation of Shendy that the dervishes were in no great strength\r\nat Shabluka or the Sixth Cataract. They occasionally sent down about a\r\nthousand Baggara horsemen to that place, and their riders scouted\r\naround the bluff rocks and hills bordering the Nile on either side of\r\nthe \"bab,\" or water-gateway and rapids of Shabluka. As a rule, only\r\nabout two hundred of them ever crossed to the east bank. The others\r\nhung around on the west bank, and built low walls for riflemen and dug\r\na number of trenches and then returned to Omdurman. A few hundred only\r\nremained to guard the forts and the narrow fairway. Much labour had\r\nbeen expended and considerable rude skill shown by the enemy in\r\nbuilding bastions and other defensive works at various places on the\r\nriver,--particularly in the Shabluka gorge and before Omdurman. Why\r\nthe Khalifa committed the blunder of making no adequate preparation\r\nfor defending the pass at Shabluka it is difficult to understand. Only\r\none conclusion suggests itself. He was probably afraid to trust his\r\nfollowers so far from his sight, lest the negroes should desert. We\r\ncontinually heard from our own blacks that most of Abdullah's\r\n_jehadieh_ Soudani riflemen would come over to us the first chance\r\nthey got. Major-Generals Hunter and Gatacre, having learned that the\r\ndervish infantry had been withdrawn from Shabluka, scouted south up to\r\nthe cataract and selected Wad Habeshi as a suitable camp and\r\nrendezvous. That village, or rather district, is on the west bank,\r\nsouth of Nasri Island and but fifteen miles north of Shabluka.\r\n\r\nA big zereba was made at Wad Habeshi and trenches were dug. The place,\r\nin short, long before the British troops stirred south beyond Dakhala,\r\nwas turned into a fortified post and made the real rendezvous of the\r\nSirdar's army.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TROOPS GOING TO WAD HABESHI.]\r\n\r\nOn 2nd August, in the face of a strong south wind, the 1st and 2nd\r\nKhedivial brigades, respectively Colonel Macdonald's and Colonel\r\nMaxwell's, embarked in very close order on steamers and giassas for\r\nWad Habeshi. The distance was about 140 miles by water from Dakhala,\r\nbut it took the gunboats and their tows over three days to get there,\r\nfor the craft were deeply ladened with men and stores. The soupy\r\nwhirling Nile flood washed the decks of the steamers almost from stem\r\nto stern. It was little short of the rarest good fortune there was no\r\naccident by the way. Everybody turned out to see the brigades off.\r\nMerrily stepped the black battalions, their women-folk raising the\r\nusual shrill cry of jubilation, whilst the bands played the favourite\r\nair, \"O, dem Golden Slippers.\" Regimental bands do droll things\r\noccasionally. I remember in the year of the Dongola Campaign and the\r\ncholera visitation, 1896, a grim blunder made by a native battalion's\r\nband. The serious surroundings of those days led me to say nothing of\r\nthe matter at that time. Military interments, in cholera cases, were\r\nordinarily made very early in the morning or late in the afternoon,\r\njust before sunset. A popular native Egyptian officer fell a victim to\r\nthe epidemic one afternoon. The sun had but set when the funeral\r\nparty, headed by the full regimental band, were seen hastening towards\r\nthe cemetery, for there was no time to lose. The tune actually being\r\nplayed was not the \"Dead March in Saul\" but \"Up I came with my little\r\nlot.\" When the gunboats started up the Nile for Wad Habeshi, towing\r\nalongside barges and giassas, all the crafts crammed with men and\r\nstores, more than one of the fellaheen battalions were regaled with\r\nthe full strains of \"'E dunno were 'e are.\"\r\n\r\nBy the end of July the Egyptian cavalry--nine squadrons--under Colonel\r\nBroadwood, with the camel corps under Major Tudway, the horse\r\nartillery and one or two batteries, had been ferried across from\r\nDakhala to the west bank. On the 4th of August the whole of the\r\nmounted force named, about 2000 strong, started to march along the\r\nbank to Wad Habeshi. Going along the bank means, at high Nile, leading\r\nthe troops upon a course half to a full mile from the river so as to\r\navoid creeks and overflows and, at same time, secure the advantage of\r\nmoving upon the more open ground beyond the zone of cultivation, out\r\nupon the edge of the bare desert. It was also early in August that the\r\nlast of the fourteen double-decked iron barges, designed for the\r\nconveyance of troops, was finished at Dakhala. Except the surplus and\r\nreserve stores everything was put to instant service. As good a march\r\nin its way, if not better in some respects than that of the 5th\r\nEgyptian battalion from Suakin to Berber, was the tramp of the 17th\r\nEgyptian--also a fellaheen regiment--from Merawi to Dakhala. They\r\nmade a record rapid tramp, following the Nile, up to Dakhala.\r\n\r\nAt Dakhala I frequently saw and conversed with the Sirdar, Generals\r\nRundle and Gatacre, Colonels Wingate and Slatin Pasha. There seemed no\r\nreason to doubt but that the Khalifa would remain at Omdurman and give\r\nus a fight. Abdullah the Taaisha gave out as widely as he could that\r\nhe meant actual business and dying if necessary at the Mahdi's tomb.\r\nHis women-folk had not then been sent away, and that looked promising\r\nfor battle. We heard that he was building more stout walls and digging\r\nnumberless trenches for defence. Of ammunition for small arms and his\r\nordinary brass rifled guns we were told he had no lack. For the three\r\nor four excellent batteries of Krupps he possessed he had but sixty\r\nrounds per cannon--enough, with good common and shrapnel shell, had he\r\nmade right use of his means, to have made matters unpleasant for us\r\nuntil our gunners and Maxims found the range. It was regarded as\r\ndoubtful whether he would be able to employ any of the machine guns in\r\nthe dervish armoury. Of all Gordon's \"penny steamers\" only one, it was\r\nsaid, was serviceable, and she was kept under steam night and day at\r\nOmdurman.\r\n\r\nThough he kept a bold front, blustered, and promised his adherents no\r\nend of good things, and told them that, as in 1884-85, it was God's\r\nwill to turn the English back at the eleventh hour, Khalifa Abdullah\r\nwas truly in a parlous state. With all the Sirdar's care, we could not\r\nkeep from the dervish leader the extent of our preparations or\r\nforwardness for the advance. As usual, Sir Herbert Kitchener was well\r\nahead of the time planned for moving on. We learned that, bar\r\nunforeseen accidents and delays, the whole of his army would be in\r\nfront of Omdurman in a little over one month from the 1st of August.\r\nTwo dates in September were given for the fall of that stronghold. It\r\nturned out to be neither. Kordofan had become openly rebellious\r\nagainst the Khalifa. A caravan of over 1140 people, with women,\r\nchildren and cattle marching overland, had arrived from that remote\r\nregion at Korti in the Dongola province. The multitude, who were\r\naccompanied by many influential sheikhs flying from Mahdist misrule,\r\nsent a deputation to the Sirdar asking his assistance to take and hold\r\nEl Obeid. As if that were not enough in the way of shutting the door\r\nbehind the Khalifa, sheikhs came down from the Blue Nile provinces,\r\nseeking protection. Help was given to them, and bodies of friendlies\r\nwere got together to seize Senaar and other important places. The Nile\r\nwas running very swift and full in August, the current moving at fully\r\nsix miles an hour past Dakhala. In July the Atbara, which had again\r\nbegun slowly to flow, suddenly rose, the muddy water roaring along in\r\na series of terraced wave-walls. Its 300-yards wide bed, where it\r\njoined the Nile, was within a few minutes choked with the tawny flood\r\nup to nearly the top of the 30-foot banks on either side. Bursting\r\ninto the Nile the sea of soup seemed to push its way in a well-defined\r\nstream nearly across the 1200-yards broad bosom of the Father of\r\nWaters.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the 2nd Battalion of the Rifle Brigade arrived on\r\nthe 2nd of August at Dakhala, during a blustering dust-storm. For all\r\nthat, black and travel-stained, they were glad to detrain, and to plod\r\nthrough the sand, and breast the laden atmosphere, in order to get\r\ninto camp hard by the Atbara. The following day the remainder of the\r\nbattalion marched in under somewhat pleasanter conditions. Everybody\r\nturned out to cheer the smart, soldierlike detachments. On the 6th\r\ninst. the first half of the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards arrived,\r\nand later on the remainder. The Sirdar and Generals Rundle and\r\nGatacre, and the staffs went to greet them. A finer and more stalwart\r\nbody of troops was never seen in the Soudan. Native opinion was more\r\nthan favourable respecting them, and I heard observations on all sides\r\nthat the Khalifa had no men he could set against them. The Sirdar and\r\nGeneral Gatacre also expressed themselves much pleased with the\r\nappearance of the Grenadiers, who looked like seasoned soldiers and\r\ncame in without a sick man in their ranks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nDAKHALA CAMP: GOSSIP AND DUTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDirt is the essence of savagery, and there is a superfluity of both in\r\nthe Soudan. I have no desperate wish so to describe the vileness of\r\nthe surroundings of the correspondents' camp at Dakhala that even\r\ncasual thinkers will sniff at it. The place was bad enough in all\r\nconscience, and, mayhap, therein I have said all that is necessary. As\r\nfor the worry of our lives, squatted as we were in the least agreeable\r\nquarter of the big rectangular fort, long will the memory of those\r\ndays and nights burden our existence. What a time I had on those sand\r\nand dust heaps, where every puff of wind and every footfall raised\r\nclouds of pulverised cosmos. For two weeks, amid the wretched scene,\r\nhideous by night as by day, I persisted in existing. It was a huge pen\r\nwith men, horses, camels, donkeys, dogs and poultry hobnobbing amid a\r\ndaily wreckage of old provision tins, garbage of soiled forage and\r\nstable-sweepings and whatnot. All that, with a temperature of 116\r\ndegrees to 120 degrees Fahr. in the shade, wore the temper and added\r\namazingly to the consumption of wet things. At the Grenadier Guards'\r\nmess one sultry evening they consumed twenty-eight dozen of sodas, and\r\nit was not a record night. Without giving anybody's secret away, I may\r\nsay I know a gentleman who could polish off three dozen at a sitting,\r\nand unblushingly call for more. These are details of more interest to\r\nteetotalers than to the general public. Yet, not to let the subject\r\npass without a word of caution to afflicted future travellers in the\r\nSoudan, the inordinate use of undiluted mineral waters of native\r\nmanufacture is most dangerous to health.\r\n\r\nWe correspondents had to wink both eyes in much of our telegraphic\r\nnews from the front, for military reasons. The press censor was\r\nColonel Wingate, chief of the Intelligence Department. In his absence,\r\nMajor-General Rundle, chief of staff, usually acted. Personally,\r\neither gentleman was all that could be desired. Both were alike ready\r\nand courteous in the discharge of their at all times rather onerous\r\nduty, giving frequent audience to the numerous contingent of eager\r\nnewsmen, garrulous and prodigal with pencil and pen. Some of the\r\nnew-comers to the business felt sorely hit, because they were\r\nprecluded from writing at large upon all subjects connected with the\r\ncampaign. The excision of their copy grieved and hurt them as much as\r\nif they had been subjected to a real surgical amputation. Yet those\r\ntwo officers but obeyed orders, for after all, and under every\r\ncircumstance, the Sirdar, as I am well aware, was the real censor. It\r\nis perhaps fairly open to argument whether the course adopted in\r\ndealing with correspondents' copy was wise or necessary in a war\r\nagainst an ignorant and savage foe. There was, at least, one official\r\nblunder which gave occasion for much annoyance, and ought to have been\r\npromptly remedied, or better still, never committed. It was expected\r\nof Colonel Wingate, the censor, that amid multifarious important\r\nresponsibilities as chief of the Intelligence branch he should find\r\ntime daily to peruse and correct tens of thousands of words, often\r\ncrabbedly written, in press messages. With the approach of the day of\r\nbattle, his own department taxed more and more his entire attention,\r\nand side by side the correspondents' telegrams grew in length and\r\nimportance. The task of proper censorship under such conditions was\r\nimpossible for any human being to discharge adequately. On that\r\naccount the public interest suffered, for press matters were often\r\nneither promptly nor fully despatched. As a rule, the correspondents\r\nwere left in blissful ignorance of what had been cut out of their\r\ncopy, as well as of the exact nature of the residuum transmitted.\r\nBesides these grievances there was one of favouritism alleged, but of\r\nthat there is always more or less in every phase of life and\r\nassociation. All told, it may be thought that the correspondents'\r\ncomplaints were of no very serious character. That depends on how they\r\nare looked at. I have no taste for cavilling or grumbling over events\r\nthat are past. Surely, however, there is a middle way somewhere to be\r\nfound between the absolutism of a general in the field, who may gag\r\nthe correspondents or treat them as camp followers, and the clear\r\nright of the British public under our free institutions to have news\r\ndealing with the progress of their arms rapidly transmitted home. I\r\nam well aware of the grave responsibilities that hedge a\r\ncommander-in-chief, and the cruel injury that an unrestrained\r\nnon-combatant may do him by recklessly writing on subjects calculated\r\nto jeopardise the success of a campaign and hazard countless lives and\r\nfortunes. The latter is an remote possibility. A commander-in-chief\r\nhas to consider that any enemy worth his salt is usually kept informed\r\nby spies and deserters, and press-men who are known and cognisant of\r\ntheir duty are no more likely to betray secrets to their country's\r\nenemies than any officer or soldier in the Queen's service. And\r\nnowadays the private correspondence from troops in the field cannot be\r\nsuppressed, and it is often published. Commanders of armies will\r\neither have to accept the presence of recognised writers, over whom\r\nthey can exercise some control, or instead stand powerless before a\r\ndangerous flood of random army letters poured into the public press.\r\nThe case can be met with judgment and care--plus penalties where\r\ndeserved. I am bringing no charges here, but discussing a vexed and\r\nwithal important question. I am glad to say that during the Omdurman\r\nCampaign there was no attempt, within my knowledge, of muzzling the\r\npress. This does not bear upon the Fashoda incident, but that came\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nNasri Island as a base of concentration was, as I have intimated, a\r\nblind. Although we correspondents were not permitted to go up the\r\nriver, or indeed move beyond the Atbara, until the Sirdar and\r\nheadquarters had started, yet we kept ourselves fully informed of all\r\nthat was happening at the front. There had been one or two little\r\nskirmishes between bands of mounted dervishes and our wood-cutting\r\nparties of Khedivial infantry. In these encounters our men had\r\ngenerally the best of the fighting, and the Baggara horsemen\r\ninvariably retreated with a few empty saddles. In July Major-Generals\r\nHunter and Gatacre had, during a small reconnaissance, proceeded as\r\nfar up as Shabluka Cataract or Rapid on one of the gunboats. The\r\nenemy, it was seen, were in no great strength there, and the seven\r\nwell-planned, thick-walled mud forts blocking the passage were weakly\r\nheld. Those two officers landed with a small body of troops and\r\nsurveyed a suitable camping site, at what they called Wad Hamid, but\r\nwhich, in reality, was north of that place and close to Wad Habeshi.\r\nThe object was to find a spot easily accessible by river and land, and\r\nwith not too much bush about. At that season, the Nile having in many\r\nplaces overflowed its lower borders, marshes extended for miles along\r\nthe ordinarily solid river banks. Wad Habeshi was merely a native\r\nwood-cutting station at first, but little by little troops appeared on\r\nthe scene, and a large entrenched camp, with lines extending for\r\nseveral miles, was duly formed. At the end of July two steamers, which\r\nhad made the perilous voyage up the Nile from the province of Dongola,\r\ncame in and made fast alongside the mud bars at Dakhala.\r\n\r\nIt was still early in August when all the four battalions of\r\nMajor-General Hon. N. G. Lyttelton's Second British Brigade reached\r\nDakhala. They were quartered in a cool and cleanly camp by the Atbara,\r\nto the south-east of the fortified lines. The 21st Lancers also\r\narrived at Dakhala in due course. Major Williams' Field Battery, the\r\n32nd R.A. of 15-pounders; Major Elmslie's 37th R.A., with the new\r\n50-pounder Howitzers firing Lyddite shells; and Lieut. Weymouth's two\r\n40-pounder Armstrong guns, besides other cannon and Maxims, were\r\nlikewise on time. Very smartly the batteries and Maxims were stowed\r\naboard native craft, which were taken in tow by gunboats to Wad Hamid.\r\nDetachments of gunners accompanied the pieces and carriages, but the\r\nmajority of the artillerymen were ferried to the west bank, whence\r\nthey marched overland to the new camp. It was at Wad Habeshi that the\r\narmy was first actually marshalled as a concrete force, and forthwith\r\ntook the field. Not a moment was lost by day or night in moving men\r\nand supplies onward. The little paddle steamer captured from the\r\ndervishes during the 1896 Dongola Expedition, which had been repaired\r\nand sent to Dakhala, was continually carrying troops and stores from\r\nthe east to the west bank. As the Nile was running at the rate of six\r\nmiles an hour in its wide bed, the \"El Tahara,\" as the craft was\r\ncalled, had to make a big circuit to effect a passage. The \"El Tahara\"\r\nwas one of the boats General Gordon built at Khartoum but never lived\r\nto launch. As she was a new craft, the Mahdi changed her name, calling\r\nher \"The Maid,\" instead of \"Khartoum,\" as it had been intended to dub\r\nher. She was an excellent vessel, with fine engines much too powerful\r\nfor her frame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOOD STATION (EN ROUTE TO OMDURMAN).]\r\n\r\nBoth Surgeon-General Taylor, on behalf of the British division, and\r\nSurgeon-Colonel Gallwey, for the Egyptian troops, completed their\r\narrangements for succouring the sick and wounded upon the march from\r\nShabluka to the attack upon Omdurman. Adequate provision was made for\r\nfield hospitals, floating hospitals and relief stations, for medical\r\nofficers, and attendants, with cradlets and stretchers, to follow each\r\nmilitary unit into action. For the British infantry it meant,\r\nsubstantially, that behind each battalion a medical officer and two\r\nnon-commissioned officers should march, accompanied by six camels\r\nbearing cacolets, and men with nine stretchers. A somewhat modified\r\nscheme was got out for the cavalry and artillery, as well as for the\r\nother Khedivial troops. In the anticipated action before Omdurman,\r\ntemporary operating stations were to be set up, out of ordinary\r\nrifle-range, and native craft, which had been fitted up with cots,\r\nwere to be brought as near the scene as practicable to receive the\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nAn attempt made to lay a cable from Dakhala to the west bank was not\r\nover successful. It was found that the great sag, caused by the\r\ncurrent, carried the cable down stream, so the whole length ran out\r\nbefore the opposite bank was reached. The steamer \"Melik\" was the\r\ntelegraph ship, and paid the cable out from a wooden reel placed on\r\nher stern quarter. A few days after the failure she was employed\r\npicking up the wire, most of which was recovered by Captain Manifold,\r\nR.E., who was the director of military telegraphs in the last as in\r\nthe three previous expeditions against the dervishes. The recovered\r\nline was relaid across the Atbara, which is barely a third of the\r\nwidth of the Nile. From the south bank of the Atbara two land lines\r\npass up the east shore of the Nile. Upon a lofty corresponding pair of\r\ntrestles an overhead wire was also hung across the smaller river. A\r\nfew miles south of Dakhala a cable had been laid to an island and\r\nthence to the west bank. From the latter point an ordinary land wire\r\nran along the desert to Metemmeh. Later on it was laid to Omdurman.\r\nThe line was put down step by step as the troops advanced. Thus an\r\nalternative system of telegraphic communication with Khartoum was\r\nearly provided for.\r\n\r\nIt stirred the blood of everybody in our dull camp to see detachment\r\nafter detachment of the second British brigade detrain. Most of us\r\nturned out and like schoolboys followed the drums and fifes as they\r\nplayed the troops to their camping-ground. A half-battalion of the\r\nGrenadier Guards, led by Colonel Villiers-Hatton, arrived at Dakhala\r\non the 6th of August. Hale and strong the big fellows looked in their\r\ncampaigning khaki. \"First-class fighting material,\" as Arabs and\r\nnegroes, who are by no means poor judges, were openly heard to confess\r\nin their interchange of confidences. There is always much camp chaff\r\nand yarning amongst \"Tommies\"--and their officers, too, for that\r\nmatter--at the expense of England's picked battalions. \"Have you seen\r\nthe 'Queen's Company,' my man,\" asked a subaltern of the Grenadiers\r\none day of a private in the Northumberland Fusiliers. Now the \"Queen's\r\nCompany\" are all over six feet in stature, and there was a friendly\r\nrivalry in grenadiership between them and certain Fusilier regiments.\r\nThe question was asked when the troops were marching over undulating\r\nbut rather bare ground where the tufted grass was little over knee\r\nhigh. It happened the officer had been detached on other duty, and was\r\nanxious to rejoin his command. \"I think, sir,\" said the Northumbrian,\r\nsaluting respectfully, \"that they have got lost in the long grass.\"\r\nThe subaltern looked unutterable things, but the \"Tommy\" held a\r\nstoical face and said not a word more till the officer went off to\r\nhunt anew for his men. For all the chaff, every one was glad to see\r\nthe Guards, and to speak of them as the Queen's soldiers. Of the\r\nsecond brigade General Gatacre said that a better body of troops could\r\nnot be wished for by any general.\r\n\r\nI rode out to several of the brigade field-days, or rather, mornings,\r\nfor there was plenty of drilling and field exercises for Lyttelton's\r\nmen. The brigade was repeatedly practised in attack formation against\r\nimaginary bodies of dervishes, as well as at assaulting supposed\r\nworks. On more than one of these occasions the gallant Colonel of the\r\nGuards, not having his charger up at that date, led his Grenadiers\r\nafoot, and once, at any rate, was mounted on donkey-back.\r\nParticularism gets lost in the desert. In the manoeuvres the troops\r\nwere usually led in line, the flanks being supported by two or three\r\ncompanies in quarter column, and the centre having in rear a few\r\nsections of companies ready to fill gaps. Save for a little noise in\r\npassing orders, the result of a fast-becoming obsolete school of\r\ntraining, even captious criticism could find no actual fault with\r\ntheir work. Advancing across wadies and scaling knolls upon the\r\ndesert, the troops were instructed to open fire with ball cartridge.\r\nThe range given was 500 yards, and the ammunition used was the\r\ntip-filed Lee-Metford bullets. As at the Atbara, without halting, the\r\nline moved slowly on, the front rank firing as at a battue, each man\r\nindependently. There were a few section volleys tried, the soldiers\r\npausing for an instant to deliver their fire. Once or twice also, the\r\nrear rank was closed up, and joined in the fusilade. One effect was to\r\nparalyse the deer and birds within range. I noticed that the tip-filed\r\nbullets did not usually spread, and that their man-stopping quality\r\nwas something of a myth. Even the dum-dum does not invariably \"set up\"\r\non striking an object. For the Omdurman Campaign a new hollow-nosed\r\nbullet was issued for the Lee-Metfords. So far as I was able to\r\njudge, it generally spread on hitting, and made a deadly wound,\r\ntearing away bone and flesh at the point of exit.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of August the 21st Lancers, together with camel and mule\r\ntransport animals, were crossed to the west bank in readiness for\r\nmarching to Wad Hamid. Saturday, the 13th August, was a very busy day\r\nat Dakhala. On that date the Sirdar went by steamer to the front,\r\ndirect to Wad Habeshi. It was given out he was merely going on a\r\nflying visit for inspection. There was renewed active drilling of\r\ntroops. Eight steamers that came down were reloaded and sent back with\r\ntroops and stores in the course of twenty-four hours. General Gatacre\r\nwent to Darmali, and there assisted in the embarkation of his old\r\nbrigade, Major-General A. Wauchope's. The task was effected within the\r\ncourse of twelve hours, the Camerons, Seaforths, Lincolns and\r\nWarwicks, with their kits and supplies, being densely packed upon the\r\nsteamers \"Zafir,\" \"Nazir,\" \"Fatah,\" and the barges and giassas, which\r\nthese craft towed. Had the Thames Conservancy writs run on the Nile\r\nthere would have been terrible fines exacted for unlawful\r\novercrowding. On the 14th August these stern-wheelers, heavily laden\r\nwith Wauchope's men, steamed at a fast rate past the Atbara camp, on\r\ntheir way south. These craft, the first of which took part in the 1896\r\nDongola Expedition, turned out to be really the most useful and\r\ndependable of the whole Nile flotilla. They steamed remarkably well,\r\ntowed splendidly, and were, besides, good fighting craft. The three\r\nAdmiralty-designed twin-screw steamers, \"Sheikh\" \"Sultan\" and \"Melik,\"\r\nwere not as fast as had been expected; they could not tow any\r\nreasonably big load, and, though they were stuffed with many\r\nnovelties, few of the innovations were of the least practical value.\r\nThey needed all their engine power to steam and when under weigh had\r\nnone to spare for driving the circular saws to cut firewood for fuel,\r\nor to start the dynamos to work the search lights with which they were\r\nfitted. Major Collinson, commanding the 4th Khedivial Brigade, left\r\nAtbara camp for the front with the 17th and 18th Battalions, or half\r\nhis force, the 1st and 5th Battalions having preceded him some time\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMARCHING IN THE SOUDAN--FROM DAKHALA TO WAD HABESHI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a land the Soudan is! As a sorely-tried friend said to me, after\r\npassing a succession of sleepless nights owing to the dust and rain\r\nstorms, and overburdened days because of the heat, \"What do the\r\nBritish want in this country? Is it the intention of the Government to\r\ndo away with capital punishment and send all felons here? I am not\r\nsurprised the camel has the hump. I would develop one here myself.\r\nWhat an accursed country!\" Yes, it is not an elysium; and when one\r\nallows the dirt, heat, and discomfort to wither all power of\r\nendurance, the Soudan becomes a horror and anathema, particularly in\r\nthe summer time. Now, the camel is to me the personification of animal\r\nwretchedness, a fit creature for the wilderness. The Arabs have a\r\nlegend that the Archangel Michael, anxious to try his skill at\r\ncreative work, received permission to make an attempt, and the camel\r\nwas the issue of his bungling handiwork. Poor brute, his capacity for\r\nenjoyment is, perhaps, the most restricted of the whole animal\r\nkingdom. Ferocious of aspect, with a terrible voice, he is\r\nnevertheless the most timid of beasts, and his fine air of haughty\r\nsuperciliousness is, like the rest, but a sham. It might be fancied\r\nthat he is for ever nursing some secret grief, for he takes you\r\nunawares by lying down and suddenly dying. Yet that is ordinarily but\r\nhis method of proclaiming an attack of indigestion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOADING UP--BREAKING CAMP.]\r\n\r\nI struck my tent at Dakhala on the 15th of August, packed my gear, and\r\nduring the course of the day crossed over to the west bank with my\r\nservants, horses, camels and other belongings. Having obtained\r\npermission from headquarters to go up to the front, I decided to go by\r\nland, marching with the cavalry and guns, for I was not free to travel\r\nexcept in their company, at least until we reached Metemmeh but of\r\nthat anon. The column in question was under Colonel Martin of the 21st\r\nLancers, and comprised three squadrons of that regiment, or about 300\r\nmen mounted upon Arab horses; three batteries, the 32nd R.A., the 37th\r\nR.A. (howitzers), and the Egyptian Horse Artillery; two Maxims with\r\ndivision and transport trains, and a number of officers' led horses.\r\nAs I have already explained, the guns of the 32nd and 37th field\r\nbatteries, together with the limbers and ammunition, were sent on to\r\nWad Habeshi by water. There was much merrymaking as usual that\r\nevening, for we were to start on the morrow. I squatted like many more\r\nin the low rough scrub by the river's brink with my caravan around me.\r\nDuring the evening I went out to dine with some officer friends. As I\r\nhad over a mile to walk to their pitch, the poor glare of the camp\r\nfires made the darkness more inky, and I had sundry narrow escapes\r\nfrom tumbling into ditches and water holes. Our bivouac was an\r\nill-omened beginning to the route march of the column under Colonel\r\nMartin. One of the periodical summer gales came on, raising whirlwinds\r\nof dust and sand. To complete our discomfiture a thunderstorm\r\nfollowed, and there was a heavy sprinkling of rain for herbage, but\r\ntoo much for men. Truly, misfortunes rarely befall singly. It was a\r\nbig Nile year, not a flood, but enough and to spare. A blessing, no\r\ndoubt, for Lower Egypt, but a calamity for us, for during the night\r\nthe river rose 2 feet, and overflowed its low, level banks. The water\r\noverran part of the camping ground, compelling many a drenched soldier\r\nto shift his quarters hurriedly. We got through the dark and troublous\r\nnight somehow, though keenly vexed by the muttered discontent of the\r\ncamels, and the persistent, blatant, variegated amorous braying of 500\r\ndonkeys. A cat upon the tiles, a Romeo, was to this as a tin whistle\r\nto a trombone. Sleep was a nightmare. It was after six a.m. before the\r\nhead of the column moved out towards the desert track. The rear did\r\nnot get away before eight o'clock, much too late an hour for marching\r\nin the Soudan. The weather was hot, the sun scorching despite a brisk\r\nsoutherly breeze. Lieutenant H. M. Grenfell had charge of the fine\r\nCyprus mule train for carrying the British divisional baggage. There\r\nwas with the column a great following of native servants mounted upon\r\nsturdy Soudan donkeys. The gawky camel shuffles along, a picture of\r\nwoe with a load of 2 cwt. to 4 cwt., whilst the little moke trips\r\nsmartly with almost an equal weight upon his back. Two Jaalin guides\r\nwere supposed to show us the shortest and best track. Major Mahan, of\r\nthe Egyptian Cavalry, had been told off to keep an eye on them and to\r\nassist us generally during the march. Two squadrons of Lancers rode in\r\nfront, whilst the rest of the troopers were supposed to protect the\r\nflanks and act as \"whippers-in\" to the column. Fortunately, there was\r\nno enemy nearer than Kerreri or Omdurman, for our line was usually\r\nstretched out for a great distance; two, three, and four miles often\r\nintervened between the head and rear of the column.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days of such marching as we had, straggling became the\r\nnormal condition of affairs, except so far as the leading squadrons of\r\nLancers were concerned. The last three days of the journey, in fact,\r\nbecame a sort of \"go-as-you-please\" tramp. To inexperience and want of\r\nwise forethought may be set down most of the difficulties, hardships,\r\nand losses that befell that column on its 140-mile march south,\r\nwhereof later.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier portion of our first day's march (16th August) the\r\ntrack lay along the edge of a pebbly desert, which left but a skirting\r\nof one to three miles of loam and rank vegetation between its\r\nmeasureless sterility and the tawny Nile waters. The small rounded\r\npebbles and the fine sand of the Nubian wilderness were surely\r\nfashioned in some great lake or sea of a prehistoric past. Far as we\r\nwere from the dervishes, a childish terror of them was entertained by\r\nthe servants. At the last moment several domestics decamped, my cook\r\namong them. I rode back three miles to catch the rascal. With unwonted\r\nalacrity and prescience he had recrossed to the opposite bank before I\r\narrived at the place of bivouac, and, having no time, I had to retrace\r\nmy steps without his enforced attendance. It had been arranged that\r\nthe column should only go fifteen miles the first day. What with\r\nwinding and twisting to avoid flooded khors or shallow gulleys we\r\nmarched over twenty miles I fancy. At any rate, with no protracted\r\nhalting for meals or for baiting the animals, we trudged on throughout\r\nthe heat and worry of the day until sunset. It was putting both men\r\nand animals to the severest possible strain, and few of the soldiers,\r\nat least, had had any preliminary hardening, for they had been\r\ntravelling for days by boat and train and were out of condition. As a\r\nrule, the Lancers trotted a few miles ahead, halted, dismounted, and\r\nwaited for the convoy to come up. Then they would ride on again, halt,\r\nand so on, repeating the proceeding many times during each day's\r\nmarch. From start to finish the column was ever a loosely-jointed\r\nbody. The pace was slow, little more than 2 1/4 miles an hour, though Sir\r\nHerbert Stewart's Bayuda desert column managed to average upon a\r\nlonger and almost waterless route, from Korti to Metemmeh, 2 3/4 miles an\r\nhour. In that campaign, however, most of our marching was done during\r\nthe cooler hours of very early morning and late eventide.\r\n\r\nThe head of the column turned in towards the river about three p.m. on\r\nthe 16th, at Makaberab, or, as the natives call it, Omdabiya--_i.e._,\r\nthe place of hyenas. For over a mile, men and animals had to make\r\ntheir way through halfa-grass scrub, and then over bare alluvial land,\r\ndeeply sun-cracked and scored in all directions. The ground was\r\ncris-crossed like a chessboard, the lines being a foot to two feet\r\napart, and four to six inches wide, and several feet in depth. There\r\nwere numberless spills through these pitfalls. One camel snapped his\r\nleg, and many mules and horses were strained and lamed. It was indeed\r\nfat land, and had formerly grown cotton. The cracks, as we found\r\nlater, were full of scorpions. During that night's bivouac, and in the\r\nearly morning, very many men and animals were stung by these venomous\r\npests. Only one soldier succumbed from a scorpion sting during the\r\ncampaign. The pain of the wound is as an intense burning or wounding,\r\nand continues troublesome for hours. Ammonia was freely used by the\r\ndoctors when the stings were severe, but where whisky could be got,\r\nthat was preferred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 21ST LANCERS--ADVANCE GUARD.]\r\n\r\nWe were early astir on the 17th inst., but it was not until daylight\r\nor 5.30 a.m. that it was safe for the column to pick its way out of\r\nthe field of cracks. Why the spot was selected, except as an earthly\r\ntrial, I am unable to state, officially or otherwise. Hard by, on\r\neither hand, there was solid and most passable ground for bivouacking.\r\nWe had a good many stragglers on the 16th inst., most of whom came\r\nrather late tumbling and grumbling to supper and bed on the rough dank\r\nground. Others lost their way and wandered to the Nile, where they\r\nwere guided by natives, and later were lucky to get a lift to the\r\nfront upon gunboats. Two men of the 21st Lancers left upon the desert\r\nwith a sick comrade down with sunstroke, watched him die, and,\r\nscraping a grave, buried him where he expired. Lieutenant Winston\r\nChurchill, who was detained until late at Dakhala, in trying to follow\r\nus, lost his way, and had to pass the night alone upon the desert. He\r\nsat holding his horse till daybreak, and then, burning with thirst,\r\nmade his way to the Nile. Subsequently he hired a native guide and was\r\nenabled to come up with the column on the afternoon of the 17th.\r\nSpending the night alone upon the desert has been many times my lot in\r\nSoudan campaigns.\r\n\r\nDuring Wednesday's march, 17th August, we crossed the low shoulders of\r\nmany rocky ridges. They are called \"jebels\" (hills), but most of them,\r\nincluding Jebel Egeda, which we passed, are little, if any, higher\r\nthan Primrose-Hill, London, though it is not a conical, but a long,\r\nbarn-roofed range. Near there I saw an enormous native cemetery. It\r\nextended to perhaps fifty acres, the pebble-covered mounds over the\r\ngraves dotting the bare desert and the sides of the hills. I have an\r\nimpression that there are ancient funeral mounds near there, and that\r\nthe burying-place of Aliab is older than the invasion of the Arab\r\nJaalin. There were fragments of sculptured stones, granite, and blocks\r\nof sandstone, and I noticed one broken memorial slab covered with\r\nGreek characters. Farther on we had to turn aside to avoid wadies and\r\nkhors, up which the Nile had flowed. We were able to water the animals\r\nat some of those places. The mules and horses buried their noses in\r\nthe flood and drank greedily, and the camels also had a fine,\r\nlong-necked thirst. We were ourselves too parched to care about the\r\nimpurities of the Nile, and soldiers and officers swallowed great\r\ndraughts of the soupy stuff.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon of the 17th the column turned to the river to\r\nbivouac at Kitaib, a twenty-two miles journey for the day. Too late it\r\nwas found that the ration depot there, from which the column was to\r\ndraw fresh supplies, was upon the farther side of a newly-made inlet.\r\nThe column had to repack, and turn west to round the creek. We reached\r\nKitaib No. 2 about six p.m. Part of the battery mules and transport,\r\nhowever, got leave to remain at the first halting-place, as they stood\r\nin no need of supplies, and I unpacked by myself, bivouacking under a\r\nclump of tall mimosa trees hard by a vast deserted village and a long\r\ngrove of date palms. I believe that over a score of men lost the road\r\nthat night and ultimately wandered to the river and got to the front\r\nby steamer. There were several cases of heat exhaustion and sunstroke,\r\nbut happily few of a serious nature. Two troopers, who floundered\r\nthrough the marshy land, got taken aboard a gunboat when they were\r\nutterly prostrate. Others, whose horses went lame or had to be killed,\r\nwere ordered down to the Nile to secure passage on as best they could.\r\nIn the darkness, as I was eating my evening meal by candle-light, two\r\nLancers shouted and rode up. They had the too common but true story to\r\ntell of having missed the track. I found supper and breakfast for\r\nthem, and started them off with their troop at eight o'clock next\r\nmorning, the 18th August, for the column left Kitaib at a late hour.\r\nMy servants were glad of the soldiers' arrival, for they were terribly\r\nafraid of robbers, the district being infested with marauding natives.\r\nDuring the night several fugitives from Omdurman passed us going\r\nnorth. Eighteen Shaggieh, who had escaped in a sail-boat, were but\r\nfour days out from Khartoum. They professed to be delighted to get\r\naway. The Khalifa, they said, had ordered every sail-boat to go south\r\nof Khartoum. Taking advantage of a thunderstorm, they headed down\r\nstream and got away. According to them, the dervishes were killing all\r\nthe Jaalin who were suspected of trying to escape north, and the\r\nShaggieh and other northern tribesmen stood in little better plight.\r\nAll natives, other than blacks and Baggara, who could get away from\r\nOmdurman were running off, as they believed the fall of the dervish\r\nrule was assured. The Khalifa's son, Osman, whose title was Sheikh\r\nEd-Din, wanted to make terms. For months the youth had been in\r\ndisgrace, but his father had reinstated him in the position of\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Forces. Osman openly declared that fighting\r\nagainst the Sirdar and the English was hopeless, and that it was wiser\r\nto try and treat with us. Khalifa Abdullah and his brother Yacoub,\r\nhowever, would not hear of treating for peace, urging that their own\r\npeople in that event would kill them. The only possible course was war\r\nto the death. From an excellent source I learned that the dervishes\r\nwere well supplied with guns and ammunition, and that the Khalifa had\r\nabout five millions sterling of treasure laid by.\r\n\r\nFrom Kitaib can be seen the dozen pyramids of Meroe, part of the\r\nkingdom of the famous Queen of Sheba. To right and left upon the\r\nopposite bank are catacombs, ruins of old temples, towns and forts of\r\na bygone civilisation. The country on both sides of the Nile in that\r\nregion has spacious alluvial belts, big as the Fayoum and as\r\nsusceptible to the arts of the cultivator. Such hills as there are\r\nrise for the most part abruptly from flat land capable of limitless\r\nirrigation. To anticipate somewhat: the region, south of Abu Hamed, up\r\nto and even beyond Khartoum, has all the natural advantages of Lower\r\nEgypt and something more. Berber is but 245 miles from Suakin. The\r\nNubian kingdom of antiquity, or that of the Queen of Sheba, must have\r\nbeen of enormous extent, marvellous fertility and great richness.\r\nEthiopia may yet fulfil the prophecy. From Kitaib we marched about\r\neighteen miles to Maguia, passing through a forest of mimosa bush, the\r\ntrack but rarely branching out amongst the halfa-grass upon the more\r\nopen country. About three p.m. the column turned in towards a side\r\nstream and settled down near the village of Maguia. The wind rose as\r\nusual at night, yet for all that the bivouac was fairly good, and\r\nthere was plenty of grazing. Next day, the 19th, we managed to make an\r\nearly start, getting away about 5.30 a.m. The distance to be traversed\r\nwas but fourteen or sixteen miles, and the column reached the\r\nhalting-place, Magawiya, about two p.m. We made our way over broken,\r\ncracked ground to the river's edge, and there bivouacked under the\r\nshade of a magnificent forest of stately date palms. The ripening\r\nfruit had been extensively plucked by thieving natives, but there was\r\nenough left for our men. It was a most picturesque scene for a camp,\r\nbut an unwholesome place for all that. It was given out that the\r\ncolumn was to rest a day at Magawiya, as the place was a wood and food\r\nsupply depot. During the course of the evening the sternwheeler\r\n\"Kaibur\" came in, and a sick officer, Lieutenant Russell, and about a\r\nscore or more of men were sent back upon her to Dakhala, or Atbara\r\ncamp. It merits record that a party of Egyptian gunners carried upon a\r\nnative bed or angreeb a sick British artilleryman from Maguia to\r\nMagawiya, from bivouac to bivouac. That was something like good\r\ncomradeship and _esprit de corps_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HALT BY THE WAY.]\r\n\r\nAt nightfall the column was formed up so that the men slept upon the\r\nground within supporting distance of each other. Sentries and patrols\r\nalso were set, but the force was not one, I fancy, that would have\r\nbeen able to offer a stubborn resistance to a surprise party of\r\ndervishes. On Saturday, the 20th of August, as was anticipated, the\r\ntroops remained in camp and enjoyed much needed rest and opportunities\r\nfor washing. Several gunboats and steamers passed us during the day\r\ngoing south, including one upon which were a number of correspondents\r\nwho were enjoying their _dolce far niente_ under awnings in a breezy\r\ndraught with inexhaustible supplies of filtered and mineral waters. We\r\nsaw the Grenadier Guards, the Lincolns, and other battalions pass us,\r\nand steam slowly up stream towards Wady Hamed. On Sunday, the 21st, a\r\nreally early start for the first time was effected. We were to march\r\nas far as Abu Kru that day, and encamp near the spot held by Stewart's\r\nhandful of men in 1885. Major Williams, R.A., went off with his\r\nbattery, the 32nd, at 3.30 a.m., and the 37th battery accompanied him.\r\nLieutenant H. Grenfell got away at four a.m., and the Lancers at 5.20\r\na.m. I pushed ahead of the troops in order to have time to revisit\r\nsome of the old ground I had been over with the Desert Column in\r\n1884-85. It was odd, that though hundreds still survived who marched\r\nwith Sir Herbert Stewart, there were but fifteen persons in the whole\r\nof the Sirdar's army who got through to Metemmeh. Of those still less\r\nwent in and left with the force that fought at Abu Klea and Abu Kru.\r\nOf the very numerous body of correspondents there were but two. I\r\nregretted that there were not several score or more of old officers\r\nand men who went through the terrible Bayuda Desert campaign. Most of\r\nthem would have sacrificed much to have been in at the death of\r\nMahdism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLATIN PASHA (ON FOOT).]\r\n\r\nMetemmeh had been made a slaughter-pen by the dervishes under Mahmoud.\r\nIt was truly an awful Golgotha. Dead animals lay about in all\r\ndirections in thousands, without and within the long, straggling,\r\ndeserted town. I rode up and looked at the remains of the little fort\r\nand the loopholed walls on the south end of Metemmeh, close to which I\r\nhad ridden on 21st January 1885, and got hotly fired at for my pains.\r\nThen I walked over the ruins of the Guards' triangular fort at Gubat.\r\nThe place was still capable of defence, and the trenches and\r\nrifle-pits were much as we left them on 13th February with General\r\nBuller. As for the graves, they were intact. The big earthwork we all\r\nhelped to raise near the river was covered with water, except a corner\r\nof the western parapet. It was, however, partly thrown down, and the\r\nditch and slopes were overgrown with grass and bushes. Then I rode\r\naway to Abu Kru battle-field and had a look at what remained of the\r\nzereba, the little detached fort I had asked might be built, and the\r\ngraves of our dead. Some of these had been rifled. Heaps of dead\r\nanimal bones lay about, for we lost many camels that 19th January\r\n1885. The enemy had gathered up and buried all their own dead. So\r\novergrown was the place that it was barely recognisable. I stood,\r\nhowever, again where Stewart received his fatal wound, where Cameron,\r\nof the _Standard_, and St Leger Herbert lay with soldier comrades,\r\nand I wandered round to where Lord Charles Beresford worked the\r\nGardners against the dervishes outside Metemmeh, whilst I found the\r\nrange for him through my glasses, by watching the spatter of the\r\nbullets upon the sand. That night my thoughts were full of bygone\r\nscenes and doings in the most heroic campaign of modern history,\r\nStewart's magnificent ride from Korti to Metemmeh. There came back to\r\nme the pain felt on the receipt of the evil news of Gordon's death,\r\nbrought to us by Stuart Wortley, and of the slaughter at Khartoum, all\r\nof which might so easily have been averted but for----\r\n\r\nOn Monday, 22nd August, the batteries again got away before the\r\nLancers, starting at 3.30 and four a.m. The day's march was to Agaba,\r\nabout twenty-six miles, and the next day's about nineteen to Wad\r\nHabeshi. Wady Hamed, which is nearer Jebel Atshan, was where one of\r\nGordon's steamers, the \"Tal Howeiya,\" returning with Sir Charles\r\nWilson's party, was wrecked on 29th January 1885. Making a detour into\r\nthe desert on quitting Abu Kru, I left Colonel Martin's column, and\r\nrode on with one native servant to Wady Hamed. As a matter of fact,\r\nthe camp was neither at Wad Habeshi nor Wady Hamed, but between the\r\ntwo. The latter, however, was the official name. But that my man was\r\nvery apprehensive of meeting patrolling dervishes, I would have ridden\r\ndirect across country, starting from a point opposite Nasri Island,\r\nwhere the depot of supplies was. On the pretext of watering the horses\r\nhe got me back to the river. The consequence was that I rode over\r\nfifty miles on Monday. However, I managed to reach Wady Hamed before\r\nsunset. On my way in I met the Sirdar, out, as usual, on an inspecting\r\ntour. He was good enough to greet me kindly and direct me to the\r\ncorrespondents' camp; those of my comrades of the Press who voyaged by\r\nsteamer had just arrived. The new camp was an immense place over three\r\nmiles long. It was a zerebaed enclosure lying along the margin of the\r\nNile in a field of halfa-grass broken up with clumps of palms and\r\nmimosa. The country all around was as a vast prairie. Beyond the reach\r\nof the Nile's overflow the sand and loam was bare of vegetation. The\r\nriver was studded with scores of verdant islands, and to the south we\r\ncould see the peaks and ridges of Shabluka, through which the Nile,\r\nwhen in flood, surges like a mill race between narrow rocky barriers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nWITH THE ARMY IN THE FIELD--WAD HAMID TO EL HEJIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWad Hamid was a camp of magnificent distances, restful to the eyes but\r\ndistressful to the feet. The soil was rich loam, and at no remote date\r\nhad been mostly under cultivation. There were several pretty clumps of\r\ndhoum palms, and a few scraggy mimosa by the river's margin. Of\r\ntree-shade for the troops there was practically none. Much of the\r\nthorny bush had been cut to form a zereba. In fact, there were two\r\nzerebas, the British division having a dividing line between their\r\nquarters and those of the Khedivial force. There was also a semblance\r\nof cleared roadways about the camp, but the ground was too spacious to\r\nbe easily made snug and tidy. Wad Hamid camp was quite five miles\r\nnearer to Omdurman than Wad Habeshi. We were within the long stretch\r\nknown as the Shabluka or Sixth Cataract. For 15 miles or thereabouts\r\nthe Nile pours in deep, strong flood through a narrow valley, which in\r\nplaces contracts to a gorge or canyon. The channel is studded with\r\nislets and rocks, and at one point the river races through a\r\nwedge-shaped cleft, apparently little more than 100 yards in width.\r\n\r\nAfter my long ride in from Metemmeh I had to let my horse rest for two\r\ndays. So until my servants arrived with my spare led horses I had to\r\ngo about afoot. My camels and baggage were with the column. It was\r\nmore of a hardship tramping from place to place in the hot dusty camp\r\nthan roughing it upon the bare ground and living upon scratch and\r\nscrappy meals of biscuit, \"bully beef,\" and sardines, till my men came\r\nin, put up my tent, and cooked my food. The British division was at\r\nthe south end of the long rectangular encampment. An interval of a\r\nmile or more separated the divisional headquarters, whilst some of the\r\nbattalions had their lines 2 miles apart. Beyond all, another 2 miles\r\noff, was the camel corps bivouacking by the rocks and foothills of the\r\nShabluka range. Their only shade from the noon-day glare was such as\r\nthey could get behind detached black granitic boulders and blocks. Wad\r\nHamid camp, viewed not too closely, was a pleasing picture set in a\r\nbackground of dark hills with a bordering of wide tawny river flowing\r\nin front. There were a good many tents in the British lines, but\r\nrelatively few in the Khedivial, for there fellaheen and Soudani had\r\nsheltered themselves as usual under palm leaf and grass huts, or\r\nbeneath their brown soldier blankets. It was one of the clever\r\ncampaigning dodges recently taught the native soldiers by our\r\nofficers, to attach loops of twine or tape along the edges of their\r\nspare blankets, so that these coverings could be quickly laced\r\ntogether and spread over light bamboos or sticks, forming very\r\ncomfortable quarters. The Sirdar's headquarters tents were always\r\ndistinguishable by the big waving Egyptian flag, a crescent and star\r\non a red ground, and near it a bigger \"drapeau rouge\" flaunted the\r\ntalismanic lettering--\"Intelligence Headquarters.\" Before\r\nMajor-General Gatacre's divisional headquarters flapped Britain's\r\nemblem, a full-sized Union Jack. Major-General A. Hunter's tent had an\r\nEgyptian flag dangling from a native spear, and the Brigade-Commanders\r\nall had their respective colours planted before their quarters.\r\nColonel H. A. Macdonald, \"Fighting Mac,\" had a characteristic brigade\r\nbanner, readily distinguishable. It was an ensign made up of four\r\nsquares or blocks of different colours, the colours of the respective\r\nbattalions of the command. To descend to particulars, besides the\r\nSirdar's and the Generals' flags, there were battalion and company\r\ncolours, and hospital, artillery, engineer, and various other flags.\r\nIn the Khedivial army the battalions were known by numerals from 1 to\r\n18. The Arabic numeral of each native battalion was worn by the men on\r\ntheir tall fezes and the khaki covers for the head-gear. It was found\r\nnecessary to devise a head-covering to shield the men from sunstroke.\r\nThat worn over the fez could be so adjusted as to afford shade for the\r\nnape of the neck, and in front a scoop for the eyes, so that the\r\narticle became transmogrified into something between a kepi and a\r\nhelmet. The British \"Tommies'\" khaki helmet-covers were ornamented\r\nwith coloured cotton patches and regimental badges. Of course the\r\nobject of the patches was to enable officers and men to identify\r\neasily their respective commands. The Rifles wore a square dark green\r\npatch, which the Soudan sun bleached to a pea green. The Lancashire\r\nFusiliers wore a yellow square patch, and the Northumberland Fusiliers\r\na red diagonal band round the helmet. As for the Grenadier Guards\r\ntheir insignia was a jaunty red and blue rosette. In Wauchope's\r\nbrigade the Lincolns sported a plain square white patch, the Warwicks\r\na red square, the Seaforths a white plume, nicknamed the \"duck's\r\ntuft,\" and the Camerons a \"true blue\" square patch.\r\n\r\nThe rapid thrusting forward of his whole army from Darmali and Dakhala\r\nwithin a period of ten days was not the least astonishing and\r\nbrilliant strategical feat achieved by the Sirdar. In that space of\r\ntime troops, stores, and all the impedimenta for an army of 25,000 men\r\nhad been moved forward about 150 miles in an enemy's country. No doubt\r\nhe knew his foe; he certainly always had them under the closest\r\nobservation. For that reason the Sirdar was able to do things, and did\r\ndo them, that other Generals would have blundered over. The great\r\nriver before the camp, with its flotilla of gunboats, looking like\r\nAmerican river-steamers, the forest of masts, the lofty poles of the\r\nlateen-rigged giassas, and the abundance of commodious barges gave a\r\nbroad hint how the transport of so many men and so much material had\r\nbeen so smartly effected. Provisions, forage, ammunition, all on the\r\nmost liberal scale, he had got together. With the troops there were to\r\nbe carried supplies for fifteen days, and enough to last as long\r\nagain were to be accumulated upon Royan Island at the south end of the\r\nSixth Cataract. Placing the reserve supplies and base hospitals upon\r\nislands meant that both would be safe from any raiding dervishes.\r\nBeyond Wad Hamid everybody was to move in the lightest possible order.\r\nOfficers had to limit their baggage, so that it should not weigh more\r\nthan 60 lbs., and the men were to march in the lightest of kits. Camel\r\ntransport was cut down, and all animals not absolutely necessary were\r\nto be left behind. For the conveyance of the baggage of each British\r\nbattalion 32 camels were allowed. All the men's heavy baggage,\r\novercoats, knapsacks, kit bags were sent on by river transport in\r\nnative craft. A blanket a-piece was what the men had, and that was\r\ncarried for them by the baggage camels. Quite enough for any European\r\nto carry in the Soudan in August were his clothes, rifle,\r\naccoutrements, and 100 rounds of ball cartridge. The native battalions\r\nhad assigned to each command 39 to 42 camels, as well as two giassas\r\nor nuggars. These carried all the regimental belongings, and also most\r\nof the men's things, for the Khedivial troops never marched with kits,\r\nblankets, or any encumbrances upon them. Clad in comfortable knitted\r\njerseys, with breeches, putties, and good serviceable high-lows, the\r\nmen of the native regiments stride freely along, each bearing only\r\nrifle, bayonet, and ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe massing of the forces at Wad Hamid was all but complete. Part of\r\nthe Rifle Brigade, detained on the river by storms and contrary head\r\nwinds, were the only absentees. On the opposite bank of the Nile had\r\nbeen mustered the mixed body of friendly natives, who, accompanied and\r\nsupported by a gunboat, were to clear that side of the dervishes when\r\nthe Sirdar advanced. It was known that they would have to deal with,\r\nprobably, 1000 Mahdists under Zeki Osman. Our allies included Ababdeh,\r\nBisharin, Jaalin, Shaggieh, Shukrieh, Aburin, and other tribesmen led\r\nnominally by Abdul Azim, the brave Ababdeh Sheikh. They were armed\r\nwith Remington rifles, but carried in addition their own swords and\r\nspears. That they might be better led and prove to be of real value,\r\nMajor Stuart-Wortley, with Lieut. Charles Wood as his A.D.C., was sent\r\nacross to take the command. Wortley was received with every\r\ndemonstration of heartiness by the Sheikhs, who placed themselves and\r\ntheir followers entirely under that able officer's orders. The\r\nfriendlies were most enthusiastic and eagerly asked to be led against\r\ntheir dervish enemies. As these allies and the Sirdar's forces were to\r\nmarch by the river's margin when possible, signalling would be nearly\r\nalways practicable between them. Telegraphic communication was opened\r\nto Wad Hamid from Dakhala by Captain Manifold, R.E., and his sappers\r\nalmost as soon as the troops got into camp. With much hard work the\r\nline had been put upon poles as far south as Nasri. When the army\r\nsubsequently advanced, as poles were not readily procurable the bare\r\niron telegraphic wire was laid upon the ground. In the crisp, hot\r\natmosphere of the Soudan, as there is little leakage, long distances\r\ncan be worked through an unprotected wire laid upon the desert. When\r\nthere were rain-storms of course telegraphic communication over such\r\nlines became impossible.\r\n\r\nOn 23rd August, the day following my arrival at Wad Hamid, the Sirdar\r\nheld a great review of his army. At 6 o'clock in the morning the force\r\nwas paraded upon the open desert a mile and half inland from the Nile.\r\nReveille had been at an hour before sunrise. It was a pleasant\r\nmorning, for a fresh breeze was blowing, and the air was agreeably\r\ncool. Several of the younger soldiers, however, succumbed to the\r\neffects of the tropical sun during the few hours the troops were kept\r\nemployed, and they had to be carried back to camp. Although the\r\ncavalry, with part of the artillery and Maxims, did not parade, there\r\nwas a big enough force upon the ground to make an imposing display.\r\nThe army was drawn up in line with a front over a mile in length.\r\nMajor-General Gatacre's division was upon the left, with the Grenadier\r\nGuards forming his right. The Queen's soldiers were ranged in mass of\r\ncompanies, column of fours right, whilst the native soldiery were\r\nbrigaded in line, Macdonald upon the extreme right, with Collinson's\r\nbrigade in reserve. The troops wheeled into column, deployed, changed\r\nfront, and engaged in firing exercise. As might have been expected,\r\nthere was more celerity and accuracy in changing formation displayed\r\nby the British than in the native brigades. All the men were very keen\r\nat their work, the expectation of being about to engage the enemy\r\ndoubtless lending special interest to their field-day. The camp, as\r\nall camps ever were, was full of strange yarns--\"shaves\" about what\r\nwas going on at Omdurman, and the Khalifa's intentions. \"Abdullah\r\nwould fight? No, he would run away; he was laying down mines in the\r\nNile to blow up our gunboats. A Tunisian had devised a torpedo, but as\r\nit was being lowered from a dervish boat, the machine exploded, and\r\nthe engineer was hoisted with his own petard.\" Then there were stories\r\nof extraordinary discoveries of precious minerals--gold mines by the\r\nscore. Two young officers, who wished some fun with a distinguished\r\nmilitary gentleman not unconnected with South Africa, persisted in\r\nfinding diamonds, pieces of rock-crystal, which, with an air of\r\nmystery and importance, they submitted to his contemptuous inspection.\r\nBut a Major had the better of the expert on one occasion. He vowed he\r\nhad found diamonds, genuine diamonds, upon the open desert, as good as\r\nany in South Africa or anywhere else; that he would be sworn to\r\nforfeit L50 if the expert did not endorse his judgment. He had picked\r\nup in one small spot no less than five. Burning with impatience to see\r\nthese precious jewels, the expert begged for just one peep at them.\r\nThe Major gratified him with some feigned reluctance; produced a \"five\r\nof diamonds,\" a castaway from some \"Tommy's\" pack of cards.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 23rd of August Wad Hamid camp was swept by a\r\nfierce storm of wind and rain. The temperature dropped 22 deg., and it\r\nbecame positively chilly. As we were within the rainy belt, which\r\nextends up to 17 deg. North, visitations of that sort during the summer\r\nwere to be expected. The troops bore the discomfort of cold and wet\r\nclothes uncomplainingly, waiting for daybreak, and the tardy sun, to\r\nget dry and warm. Bugle calls were a work of supererogation on the\r\nmorning of Wednesday, 24th August, everybody having been astir long\r\nbefore reveille. It had been given out in general orders--one of those\r\ngracious niceties of military courtesy never exhibited to the\r\ncorrespondents in these later Soudan campaigns--that the Khedivial\r\ntroops were to proceed that day to the south of Shabluka Cataract. The\r\njourney thither was to be made by the army in two stages, and the\r\nBritish division was to follow on Thursday. Wad Bishari, about\r\nhalf-way, was the first portion, and there the men were to bivouac one\r\nnight. Next day they were to complete the distance, making a detour to\r\navoid the rough hills of Shabluka, and going into a new camp laid out\r\nat El Hejir. At 5 a.m. Macdonald's and Lewis's brigades paraded, and\r\nunder the command of Major-General Hunter, stepped off. So the end at\r\nlast began to loom in sight. Major-General Gatacre wished to go part\r\nof the way the same day, in order to reduce the distance to be\r\nmarched, but the Sirdar put his veto thereon, observing that if the\r\n\"Tommies\" could not do a little march of 13 miles, they could not walk\r\nany distance. In the afternoon, at 4 o'clock, the remainder of the\r\nKhedivial division--Maxwell's and Collinson's brigades--set out for\r\nWad Bishari to join their comrades. The men were in fine spirits as\r\nthey left, cheering and singing to the strains of their bands as they\r\ngaily marched away. Some of the Egyptian soldiers were told off to\r\nremain at the worst places of the Cataract to assist in towing the\r\nnative craft through the rapids.\r\n\r\nThe bugles called the men of Lyttelton's brigade to duty at 3 a.m. on\r\nThursday, the 25th of August. I cannot say that the call awoke them\r\nfrom slumber, for all night there had been most disturbing noises\r\ncoming from the riverside, where native soldiers were reloading\r\ngiassas with stores going forward to Royan Island, for that new depot.\r\nRoyan occupies a position at the south gateway of Shabluka. It is a\r\nfinely conspicuous island, for upon the north end there is a lofty\r\nbarn-roofed jebel or hill. From the summit of Jebel Royan, at an\r\naltitude of 600 feet, can be seen 40 miles away the outlines of\r\nOmdurman and Khartoum--that is in the morning or evening, when the\r\ndistorting freaks of the mirage are not in evidence. The steamboat\r\nskippers who had ten-horse power steam sirens, used them, after the\r\nmanner of their kind, and made night doubly hideous. At 3 a.m. began\r\nour orchestra in the 2nd British brigade lines. All the camels, horses\r\nand mules had to be watered and fed. The cheerful camels then had to\r\nbe loaded, that operation being carried on as usual with a terrible\r\ngrunting chorus, all the brutes taking part. The gunboats got off\r\nbefore daylight. At five o'clock sharp, ere it was full daylight,\r\nLyttelton's men started, marching off in three parallel columns, each\r\nbattalion having its own advance guard. Four Maxims were with the\r\nbrigade. Behind the infantry was part of the Egyptian transport\r\ntrain. The Sirdar inspected the column, and saw them started fairly on\r\nthe way to Wad Bishari. Major-General Gatacre, as usual, rode out with\r\nthem to the bivouac, and then galloped back to camp. The troops were\r\nin great glee at setting off. The men marched briskly, their officers\r\ntramping beside them. On the whole, the track was tolerable, mostly\r\ncompact sand and gravel. In some places, however, it was rough and\r\nfull of loose stones, and the sand lay deep and soft in several khors\r\nand wadies that had to be crossed. The worst bit was in the second\r\nday's march into El Hejir, where a detour had to be made to avoid the\r\nShabluka Hills.\r\n\r\nAt 5 in the afternoon of the 25th of August the 1st British brigade,\r\nMajor-General Wauchope's men, also left for El Hejir _via_ Bishari.\r\nThe \"Rifles\" or, rather, half the battalion, marched with them. Owing\r\nto various causes, the \"Rifles\" were not all assembled with the\r\nBritish division until the army reached El Hejir. In the end, the\r\nsecond half of the battalion of that crack corps was transported by\r\nwater direct to El Hejir. They had quite a grievous mishap at Wad\r\nHamid. The upper part of a barge, on which many of the men's kits and\r\ncoats were stored, collapsed, and most of the articles fell into the\r\nriver and were lost. Wauchope's brigade marched forward in five\r\nparallel columns, with intervals for deploying between each. The men\r\nturned towards the west to get clear of the cultivable belt, for the\r\ntrack afforded easier going along the margin of the desert. Behind the\r\nbrigade, protected by the usual rear-guard, were six Maxims, the\r\nmedica corps, a transport column, and a numerous following of native\r\nservants riding on heavily laden donkeys. The battalion bands played\r\nfavourite regimental tunes as the men marched away. The pipers of the\r\nCamerons gave the \"Earl of Mansfield,\" whilst, with fifes and drums,\r\nthe Seaforths' pipers skirled \"Black Donald of Balloch.\" News was\r\nheliographed into Wad Hamid headquarters before we left that the\r\ngunboats had seized Royan Island and established a post there, the\r\nnatives not disputing possession.\r\n\r\nBy the end of that week, 27th August, Wad Hamid camp was evacuated.\r\nNasri Island, however, was retained as a depot, and a small force was\r\nleft there. On Friday, the 26th of August, after a great fantasia and\r\nwar-dance, Stuart Wortley's column of armed friendlies moved south.\r\nThat evening they encountered and drove back a small body of dervish\r\nhorsemen. On our side of the Nile, part of the cavalry had been\r\nscouting up to 10 miles south of El Hejir. Captain Haig, with a\r\nsquadron of Egyptian horse, fell in with a small body of Baggara under\r\nSheikh Yunis, and had a brush with them, one or two being wounded on\r\neither side. The Sirdar and headquarters embarked at 9 a.m., 27th\r\nAugust, on the gunboat \"Fatah,\" to steam through Shabluka. I left Wad\r\nHamid the same day with one servant, rode through to El Hejir, 22\r\nmiles, and arrived in the afternoon, having ridden out of my way to\r\nsee the narrower gorges of the Cataract. The spaciousness of the\r\nprevious camp was conspicuously absent at El Hejir. In rather thick\r\nbush and on partly overflowed alluvial ground, the lines were drawn\r\nclosely together. As the river kept rising, it soon became difficult,\r\nwithout making a considerable detour, to pass from one part to another\r\nof the ground by the water's margin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nEL HEJIR TO UM TERIF--INCIDENTS AND ACCIDENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Arab is picturesque but poisonous: a fine specimen of a man,\r\nthough his usefulness in the economy of things is not apparent, at\r\nleast upon the surface. He dislikes steady, hard work, is a dreamer\r\nwith a deeply religious tinge, but all the same cruel and remorseless\r\nin the pursuit of any object. We were well into the region that he had\r\nruled and ruined: a country capable of easily producing wealth,\r\ncharred and laid waste. The indigenous negro, on the other hand, is\r\nnot averse to toil,--nay, generally delights in it under normal\r\nconditions,--is simple in his tastes, true in his conduct according to\r\nhis lights, and readily turned to better things. Your Arab seems to be\r\nthe reverse of all that, and yet he is a delightful person in his way,\r\nthough a belated savage. Burned villages, blackened hearths,\r\ndestruction on every hand, these were the telltale evidences before\r\nour eyes of what the Khalifa and his hordes had achieved. Behind all\r\nthat there were the ruins of a great and long departed civilisation\r\nthat the early flood of Arab invasion doubtless did something to\r\ndestroy. Once again, as in the Atbara campaign, was the army closely\r\nfollowed by bands of the faithful wives of the black soldiers. These\r\nwomen as aforetime pitched their camp ordinarily half a mile or so in\r\nrear of the men's, choosing broken ground and thick bush through which\r\nthey could escape if attacked by dervish raiders. In rude huts and\r\nshelters built with their own hands amid the thorny mimosa and dhoum\r\npalms, they washed, ground corn, made bread, cooked food, patched and\r\nmended, and waited upon their uxorious soldier lords. \"If handsome\r\nwere what handsome does,\" these negresses would have been beautiful,\r\nbut they were very far from it, poor creatures, except as I hope in\r\nthe eyes of their husbands. Talk of the cares of a young family, not\r\neven that vexed their stout hearts and merry natures nor made them lag\r\nin marching to war with their spouses. Alas! even the pains and toils\r\nof maternity were fought down by young negro mothers, and I had my\r\nattention called more than once to women with almost new-born babies\r\nin their arms trudging along to keep up with the army. In such cases\r\nthe women and men generously did all in their power to lighten the\r\nburden of the new mothers. Their household goods were borne upon other\r\nalready overloaded backs, and if a donkey was procurable the mother\r\nand child were set to ride upon its back.\r\n\r\nEl Hejir camp was fenced about with a stout hedge of cut mimosa.\r\nBesides that there were several smaller zerebas enclosing different\r\ncommands and several of the headquarters. There was plenty of halfa\r\ngrass for grazing and an abundance of mimosa for firewood for the\r\nmen's cooking pots and the steamers' boilers. Roads had been laid out,\r\nand troughs of mud were built, at which the horses and camels were\r\nwatered, for the river's bank was unsafe. The site of the camp was not\r\nunattractive. In front the great river was dotted with luxuriant\r\nislands. On the left hand rose Jebel Royan, a Bass-rock-like hill\r\nrising from Royan island around which the Nile flowed like a sea.\r\nAgain the Khedivial division had sheltered itself in straw huts,\r\ntukals and under blanket shelters. The British soldier had a few tents\r\nand much uncovered ground at his disposal for bivouac. It may be added\r\nthat the health and general spirits of the army were splendid.\r\n\r\nAt El Hejir the press correspondents, or at any rate those\r\nrepresenting the big dailies, except the _Times_, discovered they had\r\na grievance. The news agencies shared that feeling with their\r\ncolleagues. Even into war the affairs of business life obtrude. It is\r\nnot an unmixed evil to have a grievance; trouble and ridicule come of\r\nhaving too many at the same time. I drafted a letter to Colonel\r\nWingate on the subject--a sort of \"Round Robin\" which the majority of\r\nthe correspondents signed, after which it was given to that gentleman,\r\nwho stood in a sort of god-fatherly position to us. A form of telegram\r\nwas also written and handed him for his vise, that it might be\r\nforwarded, though in somewhat slightly altered phraseology, to each of\r\nour journals. These papers explain themselves, and as they have never\r\nseen the light and the incident is as yet one of the unrecorded events\r\nof the campaign, I append them:--\r\n\r\n                               \"(CABLEGRAM) _Daily Telegraph_, LONDON.\r\n\r\n    \"Matter-Notoriety, _Times_ has two correspondents here although\r\n    one, Howard, ostensibly represents _New York Herald_, but all his\r\n    messages are addressed _Times_, London, where read.

Under the rules, all telegraphic messages must be\r\n    delivered in sections of 200 words, each correspondent being only\r\n    permitted to send in rotation that number of words and no more.\r\n\r\n    \"The fact that the _Times_ has practically two representatives to\r\n    other newspapers' one gives them a manifestly unfair advantage.\r\n\r\n    \"We need scarcely state, that in a campaign of this importance the\r\n    British public are most keenly interested. Our Editors would have\r\n    sent out, had not the military regulations precluded their doing\r\n    so, more than one representative from each newspaper or agency to\r\n    accompany the army. We respectfully submit that it is our duty to\r\n    claim equal facilities with the _Times_, and we ask you to take\r\n    such action as may be necessary, that our employers shall not be\r\n    placed at any disadvantage.--Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n    \"To Colonel Wingate,\r\n    \"Chief Intelligence Department.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a fine way of spending the Sunday, but really we were all too\r\nbusy to bear the troops company at any of the services that day.\r\nColonel Wingate laid the matter before the Sirdar, who struck with the\r\njustice of our plea summoned us all before him, when we stated our\r\ncase anew. He gave his decision, that the _Times_ correspondents twain\r\nshould only have the right to send 100 words each by telegram. We\r\ndisclaimed having any desire to curtail their letter-writing. That did\r\nnot matter. The affair I am glad to say was conducted throughout with\r\nmuch good feeling, both Colonel Frank Rhodes and Mr Hubert Howard\r\nacknowledging the right of our contention, and the affair gave rise to\r\nno break in friendship. Colonel F. Rhodes acted very promptly and\r\ngenerously, for before the Sirdar gave his decision he came to us and\r\noffered his individual undertaking, that he would decline to send a\r\nline by telegraph, leaving to Mr Howard the sole right to wire.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday the 27th August, whilst the deeply laden stern gunboat\r\n\"Zafir\" with giassas in tow alongside was coming up the river, she\r\nsuddenly commenced to sink. The water rushed over her fore-deck, and\r\nthe officers, soldiers and crew were unable to beach her on the east\r\nbank before she went down. Indeed there was a scurry to get into the\r\ngiassas and cut them loose lest they also should be lost. The vessel\r\nwent down about ten miles north of Shendy, subsiding in water 30 feet\r\ndeep, and only part of her funnel and upper structure remained\r\nvisible. With her there was temporarily lost over 70 tons of stores,\r\nincluding much ammunition and many bales of clothing. She had been\r\nchosen by Commander Keppel, R.N., as the flag-ship of the flotilla and\r\nwas rightly regarded by the \"Admiral\" as a fine vessel. It appeared\r\nthat through over-loading and rough weather water got into the hold,\r\nand within two minutes, or before anything could be done to save her,\r\nshe sank. Captain Prince Christian Victor was aboard, he having been\r\nassigned to duty with the \"Admiral,\" for the craft carried a number of\r\nsoldiers as well as an ordinary crew. Both the Prince and Commander\r\nKeppel had narrow escapes. Providentially, no lives were lost,\r\neverybody being picked up by the giassas or managing to scramble\r\nashore. As soon as possible afterwards operations were commenced to\r\nrecover part of the cargo. The ship was secured from drifting by a\r\nhawser being passed around her standing gear, and made fast to stout\r\ntrees ashore. Then some of the natives dived and several of the Maxims\r\nand boxes of ammunition were salved. As for the craft there was\r\nnothing to be done under the circumstances but to place a guard and\r\nwait until the fall of the Nile enabled her to be unloaded and\r\nrefloated. Whilst Commander Keppel and his officers and crew were\r\nmaking the best of it, the little ex-dervish steamer \"El Tahara\" hove\r\nin sight with Major-General Rundle and several officers on board. She\r\nlent all the assistance possible and then taking in tow the giassas\r\nwith Prince Christian Victor, Commander Keppel and the rest of the\r\nshipwrecked crew, except the guard left behind, the \"Tahara\" with an\r\nextra head of steam, churned up to El Hejir.\r\n\r\nI think there had been an intention at headquarters to make a few\r\ndays' stay at El Hejir, and get the army well in hand before going\r\ncloser to the enemy. The gunboats began embarking all their ammunition\r\nand commenced putting up their extra bullet proof protecting shields.\r\nBut the Nile persisted in rising and again flooding part of our camp,\r\ninterposing once more between the British and Egyptian lines a broad\r\narm of water. So again the army was ordered to \"move on.\" Drills and\r\nsundry other plans for exercises fell through and special precautions\r\nwere taken to guard camps and convoys from surprise as the army drew\r\nnearer to Omdurman.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, 28th August, at 3.40 a.m., the bugles were sounding in the\r\nEgyptian portion of El Hejir camp. It was nearly an hour later before\r\nreveille went in the British lines and the Lincolns made us think of\r\nour sins and forswear all sleep by playing their awakening air, \"Old\r\nMan Barry.\" By 5 a.m., Major-General Hunter's division of four\r\nbrigades, with bands playing, were streaming out of their zereba\r\nopenings and taking the broad, well-worn tracks across the sand and\r\ngravel ridges towards Um Terif. Macdonald's brigade was in the van,\r\nand was followed in order by Lewis's, Maxwell's, and Collinson's, with\r\nthe baggage of each brigade behind the command. The guns were upon the\r\nright of the division, the steamers covering the left. As for the\r\ncavalry and camelry, spread over a wide front, their duty was to\r\nsearch for the enemy and make sure the troops should have ample\r\nwarning of the approach of any dervishes. The two military attaches,\r\nMajor Calderari, Italian, and Captain Von Tiedmann, German, rode on\r\nwith the native troops. It was a cool morning and the battalions\r\nheaded by their bands playing all the while marched as if going to a\r\nreview. The Soudan soldiers' wives turned out again and mustered along\r\nthe line of route just beyond the camp confines. As the battalions\r\npassed them, they shouted and gesticulated to their husbands, calling\r\non them to behave like men and not turn back in battle. Yet probably\r\nover half of these same doughty black soldiers had been dervishes\r\nbefore they came over to us. \"Victory or death,\" was the cry of these\r\nfiery Amazons to their warrior lovers. He would have been recreant\r\nindeed or a marvellously brave man that would have returned to one of\r\nthem a confessed runaway from battle. It was not surprising that the\r\nSirdar did not object to their presence in the field, and occasionally\r\nsaw that they were helped with rations when food was not otherwise\r\nprocurable.\r\n\r\nThe desertion of El Hejir proceeded apace. In the afternoon of Sunday\r\nat four o'clock, when the fierce heat of day had declined,\r\nMajor-General Gatacre's division in its turn marched off to Um Terif.\r\nThe brigades moved onward in parallel columns, with the artillery in\r\nthe interval and the 21st Lancers covering the front, flanks and rear\r\nof the infantry. Tommy was jubilant and carolled, as he tramped,\r\ntopical songs and patriotic ditties. He heeded not the boisterous\r\nsouth wind that ladened the atmosphere with dust till there was\r\ndarkness as of a city fog. Battle-day and settling of old scores was\r\nnear, and withal the end of the campaign, so he pounded along. It was\r\na rough tramp by the light of a growing moon. About 9 p.m. they\r\nreached their camping and were assigned their usual position, facing\r\nsouth, the side nearest the enemy. There was necessarily some delay as\r\nthe battalions were being told off to their assigned limits where each\r\nhad to pass the night ready to spring to arms. Detachments were\r\ndetailed to cut bush and form a zereba, whilst others attended to the\r\nindispensable culinary department.\r\n\r\nEach day our cavalry had seen slowly retiring before them a few of the\r\nmounted dervish patrols. Nearing Um Terif, the enemy's scouts became\r\nmore numerous and inquisitive. Whilst a company of the Lancashire\r\nFusiliers stood on guard during the making of the zereba the infantry\r\nhad their first encounter with a dervish. From the desert there came a\r\nrush and rattling over the gravel and loose stones, as from a\r\nstampeded horse or mule. It was coming in their direction but neither\r\nsentry nor main body thought of challenging. In an instant a mounted\r\nBaggara dashed past the sentries and ran plump against a corner of the\r\ncompany bowling over two or three men. Whether it was a deliberate\r\nmadcap charge, or the fellow was bolting from the other battalions and\r\nlost his way is never likely to be known. Possibly he did not\r\nanticipate finding British troops three-quarters of a mile from the\r\nriver. At any rate he dropped or threw his spear wildly, then,\r\nwheeling about, galloped back into darkness almost before the fact\r\nthat he was an enemy had been realised. The men's rifles were\r\nunloaded, so the dervish was not fired upon. And had they been\r\nloaded, under the circumstances even then the officer, as he informed\r\nme, would have hesitated to shoot, lest he should unnecessarily alarm\r\nthe whole camp. The spear left behind by the dervish horseman was one\r\nof the lighter barbed-edge kind.\r\n\r\nUm Terif camp was not a pleasant location. There was overflowed land\r\nbetween the troops and the river, and the ground we had to bivouac\r\nupon was rough. On Monday morning, the 29th August, before full dawn,\r\nfour squadrons of Egyptian horse and four companies of Tudway's Camel\r\nCorps proceeded on a reconnaissance towards the Kerreri. The\r\ntwin-screw gunboat \"Melik\" also steamed up the river a few miles, but\r\nneither quest resulted in adding much to the information already\r\npossessed as to the Khalifa's intentions and exact whereabouts.\r\nWhether or not we were to have our first battle at Kerreri none knew.\r\nThe fact was that during the night there had been a violent\r\nthunderstorm accompanied by wind and rain. Daylight came with a\r\ncessation of rain but the gale blew steadily from the south, raising\r\nquite a sea on the Nile and a fog of sand and dust on land. It was\r\nimpossible to see or move any distance with security, and that was no\r\ndoubt the cause why the reconnaissances in both instances drew blank.\r\n\r\nFormal councils of war were rare events during the campaign. A chat\r\nwith his officers, the eliciting of their opinions off-hand and a\r\nwatchful pair of eyes in every direction early and late, was enough\r\nfor the Sirdar. The delays caused by the storms however were becoming\r\nembarrassing, and it was certain the men's health would suffer if\r\nthey were compelled to linger much longer _en route_. Still it was\r\nwell to be quite ready before pushing in to attack the Khalifa whose\r\nlarge army, it was reported, would fight desperately. At a council of\r\nwar held on Monday, August 29th, at which all the Generals, including\r\nthe Brigadiers, were present, it was decided to remain until the next\r\nday in Um Terif. The flotilla had been unable to concentrate in time,\r\nthe strong current and head wind making most of the vessels unduly\r\nlate in arriving from El Hejir. A piece of good news came to us from\r\nthe friendlies over the river. They were wont to march abreast with\r\nus, moving up the east bank. We could usually see them across the half\r\nmile or more of water that intervened, streaming along in their\r\nconspicuous garments under the mimosa and palms, or treading through\r\nthe bush and long grass. On their way to their encampment opposite\r\nthey had fallen in with a small band of dervishes who were busily\r\nlooting a village. The natives of the place had offended the Khalifa\r\nby absenting themselves from Omdurman, and so were being cruelly\r\nmaltreated. Major Stuart-Wortley's Arabs ran forward and opened a\r\nsharp rifle fire upon the raiders, who replied with a few shots and\r\nthen bolted. A hot pursuit was instituted and five of the dervish\r\nfootmen were caught. The friendlies also had the luck to capture a\r\ndervish sailing boat laden with grain. That evening at sunset, a few\r\nBaggara horsemen and footmen were seen upon the nearest hills watching\r\nthe Sirdar's camp.\r\n\r\nIt was at Um Terif that the army, with all its equipment, was for the\r\nfirst time got together within the confines of the same encampment.\r\nFrom there also it set out next day in battle array, ready to\r\nencounter the Khalifa's full strength. In the clear atmosphere of the\r\nearly morning and in the late afternoon when the bewildering mirage\r\nand dancing haze had vanished, from any knoll could be seen the large\r\nvillage of Kerreri. There the Mahdists had built a strong mud-walled\r\nfort by the bank of the Nile. They had besides blocked the road with a\r\nmilitary camp big enough to shelter in huts and tukals several\r\nthousand men. Information brought us by natives, spies and deserters,\r\nwas to the effect, that only a small body of dervishes had been left\r\nat Kerreri under Emir Yunis for the purpose of observing the movements\r\nof our army. Kerreri, which the Arabs pronounce with a prolonged Doric\r\nor Northumbrian roll of the r's, as though there were at least a dozen\r\nof them in the word, is upon the margin of a belt of rough gravel,\r\nstone, and low detached hills that extend to the southward, to\r\nOmdurman and beyond. The alluvial strip by the Nile, along which we\r\nhad marched so many days, gave place to ridges and hummocks of sand,\r\ngravel, and rock.\r\n\r\nSo we waited impatiently at Um Terif for the flotilla with the fifteen\r\ndays' supplies on board. Meanwhile the axes of an army of soldier\r\nwood-choppers were clanging upon the hard timber, which was being\r\nfelled for firewood. The ruin of agriculture had meant the growth of\r\nbush, and there was an abundance of useful mimosa and sunt growing on\r\nthe alluvial lands by the river.\r\n\r\nI ought to reproach myself, but I don't, for not having written of the\r\naggravating southern gale with its accompaniment of drifts of horrid\r\ndust and sand as the \"terrible khamseen\" or sirocco. Travellers' tales\r\nabout having to bury yourself in the sand, or at least swathe head and\r\nbody in folds of cloth, in order to avoid being choked with grit, I\r\nknow. The real thing is bad enough without resorting to poetic or\r\njournalistic licence, though some will do that anyhow. It is\r\nsufficiently trying to grow hot and perspire so freely that the\r\ndriving dust, the scavenger drift of chaos and the ages, caught by the\r\nmoisture, courses down the features and trickles from the hands in so\r\nmany miniature turbid streamlets. During a dust-storm everybody has\r\nthe appearance of a toiling hodman. Feminine relations would have wept\r\nhad they seen and recognised their soldier lads in that sorry state.\r\nEven the dashing officers and men of the Grenadier Guards ceased to be\r\nobjects of admiration, and the War Office would have howled with\r\nexquisite torture at sight of their hair and clothes. Speak of\r\nwrapping clothes around head or body to keep out the dust? It is sheer\r\nnonsense to prate so. Why it is hard enough to gape and gasp and catch\r\na mouthful of sanded breath, without that added worry. There is\r\nnothing for it, but to grin and bear it and get through with the\r\nswallowing of that proverbial peck of dust in a life-time, as quickly\r\nand quietly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe fighting gunboats or armed flotilla consisted of the \"Sultan,\"\r\nLieutenant Cowan, R.N.; \"Sheik,\" Lieutenant Sparks, R.N.; \"Melik,\"\r\nMajor Gordon, R.E.; \"Fatah,\" Lieutenant Beatty, R.N.; \"Nazir,\"\r\nLieutenant Hon. Hood, R.N.; \"El Hafir\" (\"El Teb\"), Lieutenant Stavely,\r\nR.N.; \"Tamai,\" Lieutenant Talbot, R.N.; \"Metemmeh,\" Lieutenant\r\nStevenson, R.E.; and \"Abu Klea,\" Captain Newcombe, R.E. On the loss of\r\nthe \"Zafir,\" Commander Keppel, R.N., transferred his flag to the\r\n\"Sultan,\" one of the new twin-screw gunboats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nADVANCE TO KERRERI--SKIRMISHING WITH THE ENEMY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Death and his brother sleep\" can only be staved off; they overcome in\r\nthe end. The tired soldiers dropped into profound slumber, although\r\nthe night of the 29th August at Um Terif was boisterous and the cruel\r\nenemy near. It was one of the real surprises of the campaign, that the\r\nMahdists never really harassed us, or ventured to rush our lines under\r\ncover of night, or in the fog of a dust storm. It has often been too\r\nhastily assumed that the dervishes never attacked by night. By the\r\nNile and in the Eastern Soudan they repeatedly pushed attacks under\r\ncover of darkness, or worried their opponents by persistent\r\nsniping,--as for instance at Tamai, before Suakin and Abu Klea. Then\r\nagain, their final and successful assault upon Khartoum was delivered\r\nat dawn. Hicks Pasha's force was hammered early and late. It is all\r\nthe more strange, therefore, that they left the Sirdar's army severely\r\nalone, never practising their familiar harassing tactics and seeking\r\nto secure an advantage. Numerous, swift of foot, with spears and\r\nswords, the odds would have been much more in their favour had they\r\ncome down like wolves in the night. It is difficult to say exactly\r\nwhat would have happened, and it is not pleasant to contemplate what\r\nmight have befallen. In such a conflict the Sirdar's losses would have\r\nbeen great. Could it have been that the Khalifa believed some of the\r\nstories set about that our army intended paying him a surprise visit\r\nby night, as we did Mahmoud, and so he kept his men in camp quietly\r\nwaiting for us. The utmost precautions were taken by the Sirdar and\r\nhis generals to protect the lines. A strong zereba surrounded the\r\ncamp; sentries were doubled, and active patrols were on the alert all\r\nnight. The gale continued until after sunset, when heavy rain clouds\r\ngathered, obscuring the moonlight. By and by there came on a violent\r\nand protracted thunderstorm, accompanied by an almost continuous\r\ndeluge. There was nothing to be done but to lie fast wrapped in great\r\ncoat or blanket and await the passing of the hours, wet, chilled,\r\nruminating on all sorts of queer subjects. I managed to undo a corner\r\nof my packed tent and under it obtained relative warmth, and dryness\r\nin spots.\r\n\r\nThe persistence of that storm bred despair. It was nearly 8 a.m. on\r\nTuesday the 30th August, when, having drenched us all to the marrow,\r\nthe rain ceased. The sun, although two hours high, was battling with a\r\nfine mist. It was in a perfect downpour of rain at four o'clock in the\r\nmorning, that reveille had been sounded. And it was in sludge and\r\nslush camels and mules were fed and loaded, and horses baited and\r\nsaddled. By 5.20 a.m. the army was at length on the march out of\r\ncamp, our faces set towards a village called Merreh, best indicated\r\nupon the maps as Seg or Sheikh el Taib, the latter being the name of a\r\nlow hill. The distance the force was expected to trudge was about\r\neight miles, but the overflowed land put two miles more on. When\r\ndaylight came we could see Abdul Azim's friendlies upon the opposite\r\nside of the Nile. Led by Major Stuart-Wortley, with whom were\r\nLieutenant R. Wood and Captain Buckle, the camels of their column kept\r\npace with ours. Closely skirting the east bank that day, Abdul Azim's\r\nwarriors had their right supported by one of the gunboats.\r\n\r\nWith the Sirdar and staff riding at the head of the infantry columns,\r\nthe army advanced in the formation in which it had been determined to\r\nattack the enemy at Kerreri. Once more our mounted troops pushed far\r\nahead, covering a wide stretch of country, the 21st Lancers under\r\nColonel Martin on the left, the Egyptian cavalry under Colonel\r\nBroadwood and eight companies of the Camel Corps under Major Tudway on\r\nthe extreme right. The infantry presented a front of three brigades\r\nmarching in echelon. A battery of artillery was attached to each\r\ninfantry brigade except Collinson's brigade. Three battalions were\r\ndetached from the whole force to guard the baggage and transport which\r\nfollowed in the rear. In front on the left, or nearest the Nile, was\r\nWauchope's brigade. The four British battalions thereof marched side\r\nby side in column, the Lincolns upon the right, the Warwicks on the\r\nleft, with the Seaforths and Camerons between them. To the right of\r\nWauchope's brigade was Maxwell's, and next it Lewis's Khedivial\r\nbrigades. Behind each of the three leading brigades above named\r\n(reading from left to right) were Lyttelton's, Collinson's, and\r\nMacdonald's commands. Seen upon the desert the army had the appearance\r\nof a huge square with front a mile broad. The day being cloudy, and\r\ncooler than usual for the season, General Gatacre and his brigadiers\r\nvoted at a council to extend the march. That course was adopted, the\r\narmy keeping on, but with very many brief halts for the brigades to\r\nregain their formation. By the extra tramp the troops were enabled to\r\npass beyond the broad margin of thick bush out upon the comparatively\r\nopen, pebbly, and rocky ground, which sloped to a narrow strip of\r\nsoft, wet loam fringing the river. About 1 p.m., when still fully one\r\nmile north of the hill of Sheikh el Taib, the army halted and a camp\r\nwas made. Access to the Nile was very difficult, for overflowed, boggy\r\nland interposed. Roads, however, were made with cut bush, and the\r\nanimals were led over them to be watered. During the army's march the\r\nLancers scoured the country far in front. They managed to get into\r\ntouch with some dervish patrols whilst scouting. The opposing troopers\r\nlooked at each other from relatively open ground, and standing\r\nseparated by only a few hundred yards. One Baggara horseman came\r\nwithin 150 yards of our men. The Lancers, keen to engage with steel,\r\ndid not attempt to fire upon their intrusive foemen, but innocently\r\ntried instead to bag them. Several times our troopers advanced to the\r\ncharge, but the enemy, when the Lancers sought to put hands upon them,\r\nwere gone. That day the Baggara horsemen were met with in far greater\r\nnumbers than previously. By instructions, the Lancers rushed one of\r\nthe many small villages, or groups of native mud-dwellings and beehive\r\nstraw huts that dotted the sparse bush-land a mile or more inland from\r\nthe river beyond Sheikh el Taib. Several of the enemy hastened away,\r\nand in one of the huts a man in dervish dress was found awaiting the\r\ntroops. He turned out to be a secret agent of Colonel Wingate's\r\nIntelligence Department. The spy in question was a Shaggieh, named\r\nEshanni, and but thirty hours out from Omdurman. I was led to\r\nunderstand that he gave much valuable information as to the position\r\nand strength of the Khalifa's force and the state of affairs in\r\nOmdurman. We were told that the Khalifa meant to attack us at or near\r\nKerreri. There was an old-time prophecy of the Persian Sheikh\r\nMorghani, whose tomb is near Kassala, that the English soldiers would\r\none day fight at Kerreri. Mahomed Achmed and Abdullah had further\r\nadded to the prediction that there they were to be attacked and\r\ndefeated by the dervishes under the Khalifa. Kerreri plain, therefore,\r\nhad become a sort of holy place of pilgrimage to the Mahdists. It was\r\ncalled the \"death place of all the infidels,\" and thither at least\r\nonce a year repaired the Khalifa and his following to look over the\r\ncoming battle-ground and render thanks in anticipation for the\r\nwholesale slaughter of the unbelievers and the triumph of the true\r\nMoslems.\r\n\r\nAll except those on duty were abed by last post on 30th August at\r\nSheikh el Taib camp. Lights were ordered out, and the camp for a time\r\nrelapsed into darkness and silence. Headquarters and all other tents\r\nhad been struck and packed. During the night there was shooting, the\r\ncrack of the musketry sounding relatively near, but occasioning little\r\nannoyance. The bullets were badly aimed if directed against the\r\nBritish quarters. Whether the firing was really meant for \"sniping\" by\r\nthe dervishes, or was only a note of warning to their friends of our\r\npresence, was not easy to decide with any degree of certainty. There\r\nwas no big roll of wounded to test the enemy's intent by, and a later\r\nincipient alarm caused in another part of the camp in the small hours\r\nwas possibly all a mistake. One thing the dervishes did do. After the\r\nmanner of hill-men, they lit beacon fires on the rocky ridges around\r\nus to warn the Khalifa of our whereabouts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARTILLERY GOING TOWARDS OMDURMAN.]\r\n\r\nThat night the camp lines had been drawn still closer than ever, only\r\n260 yards' front being given to each battalion. On the morning of 31st\r\nthe troops were early astir. By 5.30 a.m. the main body, following the\r\nmounted troops, had faced to the right, and were marching to the\r\nwestward so as to clear the bush and get out upon the open desert\r\ntracks leading to Omdurman. The ground the army passed over was\r\nbroken, and there was scrub with several small khors to cross, so the\r\nforce proceeded slowly and cautiously. Four of the gunboats steamed up\r\nthe river, keeping abreast of our widely spread out cavalry. About six\r\no'clock the Lancers had again ascended to the top of El Taib, a hill\r\nfrom which at that hour I was enabled to get a view of the dervish\r\ncamp. It appeared to be about ten miles due south. The Mahdists were\r\ndisposed in three long dense lines, at almost right angle to the\r\nriver. They were partly hidden among the low scrub west of Kerreri\r\ntown or village, their right being quite 2000 yards from the Nile,\r\nwhich showed they had a wholesome respect for the gunboats. Flags and\r\nhelios were speedily busy in the hands of our signalmen sending back\r\ninformation to the Sirdar. Seeing groups of dervishes within range, as\r\nwell as bands of Baggara horsemen, the gunboats opened fire from their\r\n15-pounders and Maxims shortly after 7 a.m., driving the enemy's\r\nnearest patrols into hiding or out of range.\r\n\r\nIn one of the numberless villages passed, there were several mutilated\r\nand charred human bodies, victims of dervish suspicion, greed and\r\ncruelty. Pushing well ahead on our right the Khedivial mounted force\r\ngot a chance to send a few volleys into groups of Abd el Baki's\r\nscouts. That Emir commanded the dervish outlying forces. It was still\r\nquite early when after an easy journey of eight miles the infantry\r\nturned aside towards the river. The army was halted at a place called\r\nSururab, a few miles north of Kerreri. Why it was called Sururab I\r\nknow not, nor have I found the name on any map; but that was the\r\nofficial designation given to the place where the force subsequently\r\nbivouacked. The only reasonable fault to be found with Sururab was\r\nthat the river banks were exceedingly difficult of access. Our camps\r\nwere getting from bad to worse. That day flocks of huge vultures were\r\nto be seen circling overhead as the army advanced. It may have been\r\nour approach that disturbed them from their carrion feasts in the\r\ndevastated villages and the abandoned dervish camps. Omdurman itself\r\nmust also have long been a choice feeding place for them.\r\n\r\nOnce more the Sirdar's army had to spend an uncomfortable night. The\r\nfew tents that had been carried so far afield belonged to\r\nheadquarters, generals, commanding officers, and correspondents. They\r\nwere more of a burden than a comfort, for all canvas had to be struck\r\nby last post, and thereafter neither lights nor loud talking were\r\npermitted. The native troops' low shelter tents made out of their\r\nspare rough blankets were allowed to pass unchallenged. It was another\r\nnight to be remembered which the army passed at Sururab. Early in the\r\nevening the clouds gathered, and a series of violent thunderstorms,\r\naccompanied by heavy rain, continued almost without cessation through\r\nthe weary, lagging hours. Rolled in their blankets, the soldiers,\r\nwetted through, lay upon the sodden ground. Such of us as could\r\ncrawled under sheets of canvas or waterproofs, but these afforded\r\nlittle protection from the driving sheets of falling water. From\r\nSirdar to private none escaped a thorough wetting. The enemy, had he\r\nchosen, might have advanced from Kerreri or Omdurman, and been upon us\r\nere an alarm could have been given. Shortly after sunset everybody had\r\nto be within the zereba. All openings in the hedge were thereafter\r\nstopped up, and no one was allowed outside before reveille. Officers\r\nand men of Gatacre's division had as usual to sleep in their places\r\nlying down in the ranks fully dressed, with their arms beside them,\r\nready to spring to attention. Sentinels and patrols, watchful and\r\nobservant, moved noiselessly about throughout the whole night. True,\r\nthere were outside a few of Slatin's most trusted native friends,\r\nchiefly Jaalin, set to listen and raise an outcry if the Khalifa's\r\ndervishes came down upon us under cover of the inky night. But I had\r\ngrave doubts whether these native allies would have been of any\r\nservice, as the likelihood was that they were huddled under some rock\r\nor tree, shivering in their wraps and sheepskins. Had the Khalifa been\r\nastute or a tactician he would have attacked our camp at Sururab that\r\nnight or early next morning. He must have succeeded, at any rate, in\r\ngetting close enough to us without our hearing a note of warning to\r\nhave placed his army upon a practical equality with ours in point of\r\nvalue of rifle fire. The Remington at 300 yards is as good as the\r\nLee-Metford for killing or wounding. His superiority in numbers and\r\nmobility would have been all in his favour. Luckily, it was not to be.\r\nWe were again allowed to sleep in such peace as the elements would\r\npermit. The fact remains that the dervishes lost another of the\r\nseveral excellent chances they had to do us signal hurt.\r\n\r\nReveille went at 3.45 a.m. on 1st September. Little need of it there\r\nwas, for the men were astir, trying to keep warm by stamping about. In\r\nthe driving rain and slush the army got ready to march forward. The\r\nboats, as usual, were sent on with the surplus stores, whilst the men\r\ncarried one day's emergency rations in their haversacks, and two days'\r\nordinary food was taken upon the camels of each battalion. Once more\r\nthe brigades marched in echelon. Gatacre's division was leading as\r\nbefore on the left, with Wauchope's brigade in front, and Lyttelton's\r\nbehind. Steadily, deliberately, the armed tide of men flowed over the\r\nundulating plain, down into shallow khors, swelling through the scrub,\r\ntheir serried ranks always plainly to be seen. I went forward again\r\nwith the cavalry, accompanying the 21st Lancers, who were upon the\r\nleft front. The Egyptian troopers and the camelry went to their usual\r\nplace upon the right. In a short time we found that the dervish\r\nadvanced camp west of Kerreri had been abandoned, the enemy having\r\nfallen back and joined their main force under the Khalifa nearer\r\nOmdurman. Word was sent back to the Sirdar that the track was clear of\r\nthe enemy, and so the skirmish before getting into camp, which all the\r\ninfantry expected with some degree of confidence and elation, did not\r\nhappen. By 10 a.m. the army had wheeled into the lines assigned it in\r\nthe southward portion of the scattered village of Kerreri. Once more\r\nboth wings rested upon the Nile, Gatacre's division in front (south),\r\nMacdonald's brigade at the north, with Collinson's brigade within and\r\nin reserve. The army encamped in an irregular triangular enclosure, on\r\none side being the river, our flanks and face being protected by the\r\ngunboats. Our zereba outline was something like a broken-backed\r\npyramid.\r\n\r\nWhilst the infantry were settling down in camp at Kerreri the cavalry\r\nwere pushing in the enemy's outposts. The British division cut and\r\nbuilt around their front a good stout thorny zereba. Lyttelton's\r\nbrigade and three batteries were placed nearest the river. Upon their\r\nright was Wauchope's brigade, next to it was Maxwell's and Lewis's\r\nbrigades, and then to the right, Macdonald's crack command.\r\nCollinson's brigade was held in reserve within the zereba; Colonels\r\nMaxwell, Lewis and Macdonald had their front protected by a double\r\nline of ordinary shelter-trenches dug in the loose sand and gravel.\r\nThe British Tommies had no trench. Going forward a mile or so to\r\nrejoin the cavalry I climbed the rugged granitic slopes of Surgham\r\nHill. Like most of the \"jebels,\" or mounts, in this region, compared\r\nwith the spacious wilderness about them they are but toy hills. Few\r\nof them are much over 150 feet high, large as they often loom in the\r\ndeceiving light of the Soudan. Many are but 50 feet in height, and\r\nthere are regular, peaky, and prettily-shaped little mountain ranges,\r\nthe summits of which overtop the plain but five to ten yards. Such\r\nhills children might build in play by the sea-shore. Surgham was quite\r\na big one, and the signallers soon took possession of it, flagging and\r\n\"helioing\" back to camp. From its top I was enabled to see Omdurman,\r\nwith Khartoum in the distance. The Mahdi's white, cone-shaped tomb,\r\nits dome girt with rings, and ornamented with brazen finials, globe\r\nand crescent, shone not six miles away in the midst of miles of mud\r\nand straw huts. Four arabesque finials rose, one from each corner of\r\nthe supporting wall. Before the town was a wall of white tents, the\r\noriginal camping ground of the Khalifa's levies and reinforcements\r\ndrawn from distant garrisons. Midway to Omdurman, or within three\r\nmiles of where I stood, was the whole dervish army. Clearly they had\r\nmoved out from the city, and were organised as a force prepared for\r\ninstant battle. Their tents, camels, and impedimenta had been left\r\nbehind. Only a few low shelter-tents marked the lines in which the\r\nKhalifa's army lay in the sparse bush. There were flags and banners by\r\nhundreds, indicating the position of the leaders, chiefs and lesser\r\nemirs. The Khalifa's great black banner, with its Arabic lettering\r\nsewn in the same material, was displayed from a lofty bamboo pole,\r\nplanted in the dense central part of the force. To the left of it,\r\nour right, were green and blue flags of the Shereef, or second\r\nKhalifa, and Osman or Sheikh Ed Din, the Khalifa's son and\r\ngeneralissimo of his army. Osman, we heard, had been reinstated in\r\nparental favour, for he had fallen from grace for advising his father\r\nto make peace with the Sirdar. As in a daisy-pied field, there were\r\ndervish battle flags everywhere among the thick, swart lines that in\r\nrows barred our way to Omdurman. The banners were in all colours and\r\nshades, shapes, and sizes, but only the Khalifa's was black. The force\r\nwas apparently drawn up in five bodies or divisions. Abdullah's, in\r\nthe centre, must have numbered fully 10,000 men. Counting as carefully\r\nas I could, I estimated the enemy who were to be seen as at least\r\nnumbering 30,000, and, perhaps, 35,000 men. Horsemen and camelmen\r\ncould be seen moving about their lines, and here and there others\r\nriding, native fashion, on donkey-back. It seemed to be a\r\nwell-organised, intelligently-handled enemy we had in front.\r\n\r\nThereafter I rode onward and joined the farthest Lancers' outposts.\r\nSmall parties of dervishes, mostly Jaalin and blacks, who were caught\r\nby the troopers, but had perhaps purposely given the Khalifa the slip,\r\nwere rounded up and sent back under escort as prisoners. Meanwhile\r\nboth the British and Khedivial mounted troops kept pushing on, driving\r\nin the enemy's scouts. By noon there had been a series of attempts on\r\nour side to charge, but the foemen always gave way. The Egyptian\r\ncavalry under Colonel Broadwood and the camelry under Major Tudway,\r\nmaking a wide detour, got close to the dervish left, and engaged the\r\nenemy occasionally with rifles and Maxims. But the enemy's horse came\r\nout in strength, supported by footmen, and threatened them, so\r\nBroadwood's men had to fall back.\r\n\r\nFour of the Sirdar's gunboats, which had meanwhile steamed ahead, were\r\nbriskly battering the Mahdist riverside forts. These works, like those\r\nabandoned to us at Shabluka Cataract and Kerreri, were strong,\r\nwell-built earthen bastions, with flanking curtains. The central\r\nsemicircular portion was pierced with three embrasures for ordnance,\r\nbut so badly made as to admit of but a limited area of fire. Each\r\ncurtain was loopholed for musketry. There was a deep, wide trench\r\nbefore the works, the parapet of which was about ten feet high, whilst\r\nthe walls of earth were about three yards in thickness. Despite the\r\nskill shown in the construction and placing of the forts, the\r\ngunboats, by bringing their Maxims and quick-firing guns to bear,\r\npassed them unscathed. There were Krupp guns mounted in most of these\r\nworks, but not a steamer was hit. Another event of even greater\r\nimportance was meanwhile happening. From the first it had been planned\r\nthat the Lyddite guns and the 40-pounder Armstrong cannon should be\r\nemployed to batter down or breach the Khalifa's walls. The howitzers\r\nwere sent on by one of the gunboats to be landed on Tuti Island, which\r\nis opposite Khartoum, for that purpose. But it was found the maps were\r\nwrong, and a better position was selected within suitable range on the\r\nsolid land of the east bank. As for the 40-pounders it was found too\r\ninconvenient to tranship such heavy ordnance.\r\n\r\nThe battery firing the 50-lb. Lyddite shells having found the range,\r\nabout 3000 yards, opened fire upon Omdurman. In quick succession rapid\r\nsplashes of lurid flame burst in the town, followed by great clouds of\r\ndust and whirling stones. I watched them training the howitzers on the\r\ngreat wall and the whited sepulchre of the false prophet. With the\r\nthird shot they struck the base and anon the top of the Mahdi's tomb,\r\nsmashing the structure, and bringing down the uppermost cap of it. The\r\nnature of the bombardment and its success was galling to the dervish\r\nforce, as could be seen by the commotion it excited in the city and\r\ntheir camp. Our cavalry on the left got to skirmishing again with the\r\nenemy's outposts, on which we had closed to within 800 yards. Bodies\r\nof their horsemen came out and drove our advanced scouts in. Then,\r\nthree squadrons of the Lancers were led forward by Colonel Martin, and\r\nthe enemy once more retired. This, seemingly, was too much for the\r\nKhalifa, so his whole army was set in motion against us. They came on\r\ndeliberately, but smartly, their infantry trying to surround and cut\r\nour troopers off. Dismounting part of his men, Colonel Martin\r\nmaterially delayed the enemy's advance, for the dervishes sent out\r\nlines of black riflemen to deal with the Lancers. A rattling skirmish\r\nat 500 to 800 yards ranges was in a few minutes in full progress. News\r\nwas sent back to the Sirdar that the enemy's army were coming on _en\r\nmasse_, and step by step Colonel Martin's troops were retired towards\r\nMount Surgham and the river. Our retreat was pressed, and the regiment\r\nhad to mount and trot off behind the shelter of Surgham to avoid the\r\nvigorous advance of the dervishes. Among our mounted troops there were\r\nrelatively few losses, although the enemy must have suffered\r\nconsiderably. I noticed many of them being knocked over by the\r\nLancers' fire. Before 3 p.m. the Sirdar had all his infantry and guns\r\nin position, awaiting the expected attack within his lines at Kerreri.\r\nA few mud-huts on the south face of the zereba materially added to the\r\nstrength of the position. Our cavalry had all to continue retiring,\r\nand ultimately the Lancers went down to the river so as to clear the\r\nfront of the army. Surgham Hill was occupied by a few of the\r\ndervishes. From there they must have had an excellent view of our\r\ncamp; indeed, they had as good a panoramic peep at us as we had at\r\nthem. For some reason the Khalifa thought better of attacking us that\r\nday, and so halted with his main body quite out of range. Towards\r\nsunset his men gradually retired, going back to their former position.\r\nThey had left their camp-fires burning, and their chunks of meat and\r\ncakes of rough grain cooking under the supervision of slaves and\r\nfollowers when they came out against the Lancers. So it happened on\r\nthe eve of the coming battle both armies rested quietly in their\r\nrespective camps, eating, sleeping, and the devout praying, within a\r\nfive miles' march of each other. For supper our men had stringy bully\r\nbeef and biscuit or bread. The dervishes had hunks of freshly roasted\r\nmutton, goat and cattle, done on the embers, and bannocks of dhura\r\nmeal. Extra precautions were again observed to secure the Sirdar's\r\narmy from any night attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF OMDURMAN--FIRST PHASE OF THE FIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this and the succeeding chapter, the account given of the victory\r\nof Omdurman is substantially the same as that which appeared in the\r\ncolumns of various issues of the _Daily Telegraph_. The narrative,\r\nalthough hastily prepared, gives an accurate description of the fight,\r\nand copies of it not being now procurable, I venture to make use of\r\nit, adding only here and there lines of new matter. I have reserved to\r\na later chapter the personal narratives of officers who were in the\r\naction, and who have kindly supplied me with particulars of the part\r\nborne by the gunboats, the cavalry, and Major Stuart-Wortley's\r\nfriendlies. With these I have coupled various details drawn from my\r\nown observation. I found that through errors in transmission of the\r\nmessages, or mistakes in dealing with them, part of my copy had got\r\ncredited to other sources.\r\n\r\n                                       OMDURMAN, _2nd September 1898_.\r\n\r\nThe supreme and greatest victory ever achieved by British arms in the\r\nSoudan has been won by the Sirdar's ever-victorious forces, after one\r\nof the most picturesque battles of the century. At last! After fifteen\r\nvexatious years spent in trying to get here, an Anglo-Egyptian army\r\nhas recovered Khartoum and occupied Omdurman. Gordon has been avenged\r\nand justified. The dervishes have been overwhelmingly routed, Mahdism\r\nhas been \"smashed,\" whilst the Khalifa's capital of Omdurman has been\r\nstripped of its barbaric halo of sanctity and invulnerability.\r\nStriking and dramatic as has been the manner in which the ending of\r\nthe curse of the Soudan has come about, the tale need lose none of its\r\nforce by being simply told. The grandeur of the plain story requires\r\nno straining after catchwords. Of those who with Sir Herbert Stewart's\r\ndesert column toiled and fought to reach Metemmeh in January 1885,\r\nless than a dozen are with the Sirdar's army, and of these but three,\r\nincluding the writer, were correspondents. But to the narrative of the\r\nbattle which, at a stroke, has broken down the potent savage barriers\r\nof blood and cruelty, and re-opened the heart of the great African\r\ncontinent to the sweetening influences of civilised government.\r\n\r\nStorm and cloud had passed. The moon rose early on the night of 1st\r\nSeptember. It shone brightly over and around our bivouac, south of\r\nKerreri village, or near Um Mutragan, according to the cartographers.\r\nThe north end of our camp lines approached the river just 500 yards\r\nsouth of the ruined dervish redoubt of Kerreri. Sentinels were posted\r\nalong the irregular-shaped triangle, or, shall I call it, broken\r\nsemi-circle, within which the army lay. The sentries had a fair range\r\nof view to their front. Men on the lookout also occupied the roofs of\r\nthe few native mud-huts at the south-western corner of the camp. Four\r\nJaalin scouts were sent forward to Surgham Hill to listen, and to\r\napprise the troops of any movement on the part of the Khalifa's army.\r\nOther friendlies lay about outside, hearkening and watching, to warn\r\nus of any attempt of the enemy to surprise the zereba. The sentries\r\nwere bid to shoot at any man rushing singly upon him, and to fire upon\r\nlarge bodies advancing at the double. Men running in, however, in\r\npairs, were either to be challenged or allowed to come in without\r\nbeing fired on. Such was the simple yet ample arrangement. To\r\nanticipate somewhat, it so happened that about midnight there was some\r\nfiring, and the four Jaalin \"smellers of danger and dervishes\" upon\r\nJebel Surgham came sprinting in, a four-in-hand, and cleared the broad\r\ncut mimosa hedge that was piled before the lines of Gatacre's\r\ndivision, at a bound. The time they made broke all records.\r\n\r\nFrom the north to the south end along the river the camp was about one\r\nmile in length, and its greatest width about 1200 yards. There were a\r\nfew mud-huts within the space enclosed by mimosa and the double line\r\nof shallow shelter-trenches. The cut bushes were piled in front of the\r\nBritish troops, who were facing Omdurman and the south; the trenches\r\ncovered the approach from the west and north where the Khedivial\r\ntroops stood on guard. Neither extremity of the lines of defence,\r\nzereba or trench, quite extended to the river. Openings of about\r\nthirty to fifty yards were left. Besides these there were other small\r\npassage-ways left open during daylight, but closed at night. Near the\r\nriver facing south the ground was rough, and there were several huts,\r\nso that the security of the camp was not imperilled by the failure to\r\ncarry the hedge or trenches to the Nile's brink. Lyttelton's brigade\r\nwere placed upon the left south front. Wauchope's men continued the\r\nline to the right. In the south gap were three companies of the 2nd\r\nBattalion Rifle Brigade, their left resting on the river. On their\r\nimmediate right were three batteries--the 32nd Field Battery of\r\nEnglish 15-pounders, under Major Williams; two Maxim-Nordenfeldt\r\nmountain batteries, 12 1/2-pounders, respectively under Captains Stewart\r\nand de Rougemont; and six Maxims under Captain Smeaton. Later on these\r\nguns and Maxims during the first stage of the battle--for the action\r\nresolved itself into a double event ere the combat ceased--were\r\nwheeled out until they were firing almost at right angles to the\r\nzereba line. On the right of the guns, in succession, were the\r\nremainder of the Rifles, the Lancashire Fusiliers, the Northumberland\r\nFusiliers, and the Grenadier Guards. In the interval between General\r\nLyttelton's brigade and General Wauchope's, which stood next to it,\r\nwere two Maxims. Then came the Warwicks, Camerons, Seaforths, and\r\nLincolns. To the Lincolns' right, where the trenches began and the\r\nline faced nearly west, was Colonel Maxwell's brigade. Between\r\nWauchope's and Maxwell's brigades were two Maxims, and, I think, for a\r\ntime during the first attack made by the dervishes, the two-gun mule\r\nbattery of six-centimetre Krupp guns. To complete the tale of the guns\r\nplaced for defending the camp, there was Major Lawrie's battery of\r\nMaxim-Nordenfeldts on the right of Maxwell's brigade next Macdonald's,\r\nand on the north side, near the right of the position facing west,\r\nMajor Peake's battery of Maxim-Nordenfeldts. These guns had done so\r\nwell at the Atbara, that the Sirdar promptly increased his artillery\r\nby adding three batteries of that class. Maxwell's brigade was\r\ncomposed of three Soudanese and one Egyptian battalion, viz., 8th\r\nEgyptian, and 12th, 13th, and 14th Soudanese. Farther north, to the\r\nright of Colonel Maxwell's men, was Lewis Bey's brigade of Egyptian\r\ntroops--the 3rd, 4th, 7th, and 15th Battalions. The 15th Battalion was\r\na fine lot, mostly reservists. Upon the farthest west and northern\r\nface of the protected camp was. Colonel Macdonald's oft-tried and\r\nfamous fighting brigade, made up of the 9th, 10th, and 11th Soudanese,\r\nwith the true-as-steel 2nd Egyptians. Within the wall of hedge,\r\ntrenches, and armed infantry, in reserve, was another brigade, the 4th\r\nKhedivial, commanded by Major Collinson. It was made up of the 1st,\r\n5th, 17th, and 18th Egyptian battalions. The two last-named were\r\nrelatively newly-raised regiments, but were composed of fine\r\nsoldierly-looking fellaheen. The divisional brigade and battalion\r\ncommanders and staff were:--British division, Major-General Gatacre\r\ncommanding; staff: Major Robb, D.A.G.; Captain R. Brooke, A.D.C.;\r\nLieuts. Cox and Ingle, orderly officers; Surgeon-Colonel MacNamara,\r\nP.M.O. First British Infantry brigade, Brigadier-General A. Wauchope;\r\nstaff: Major Doyle Snow, brigade-major; Captain Rennie, A.D.C.;\r\nSurgeon-Lieut.-Colonel Sloggett, P.M.O. Second brigade,\r\nBrigadier-General, Hon. N. G. Lyttelton; staff: Major A Court,\r\nbrigade-major; Captain Henderson, A.D.C. Surgeon-General W. Taylor was\r\nthe principal medical officer of the British division. Lieut.-Colonel\r\nC. J. Long, R.A., commanded all the artillery. Khedivial\r\ntroops--Infantry division, Major-General A. Hunter, commanding; staff:\r\nSurgeon-Colonel Gallwey, P.M.O.; Captain Kincaid, D.A.G.; Lieut.\r\nSmythe, A.D.C. 1st brigade, Brigadier H. A. Macdonald; Major C. Keith\r\nFalconer, brigade-major. 2nd brigade, Brigadier Lewis; 3rd brigade,\r\nBrigadier Maxwell; 4th brigade, Brigadier Collinson.\r\n\r\nThe battalion commanders of British troops were:--Grenadier Guards,\r\nLieut.-Colonel Villiers-Hatton; Lancashire Fusiliers, Lieut.-Colonel\r\nCollingwood; Northumberland Fusiliers, Lieut.-Colonel C. G. C. Money;\r\nRifle Brigade, Colonel Howard; Warwickshires, Lieut.-Colonel Forbes;\r\nLincolns, Lieut.-Colonel Louth; Camerons, Lieut.-Colonel G. L. C.\r\nMoney; Seaforths, Lieut.-Colonel Murray. Those of the Khedivial\r\nbattalions were:--Macdonald's brigade, Majors Pink, 2nd Egyptian;\r\nWalter, 9th Soudanese; Nason, 10th Soudanese; Jackson, 11th Soudanese.\r\nLewis's brigade, Majors Sellem, 3rd Egyptian; Sparkes, 4th Egyptian;\r\nFatby Bey, 7th Egyptian; and Major Hickman, 15th Egyptian. Maxwell's\r\nbrigade, Majors Kalousie, 8th Egyptian; Townsend, 12th Soudanese;\r\nSmith-Dorian, 13th Soudanese; Shekleton, 14th Soudanese. Collinson's\r\nbrigade, Captains (O.C.'s) Bainbridge, 1st Egyptian; Abd El Gervad\r\nBorham, 5th Egyptian; Bunbury, 17th Egyptian; and Matchell, 18th\r\nEgyptian.\r\n\r\nThe troops were ranged two deep in front with a partial second double\r\nline or supports placed twenty yards or so behind them. These assisted\r\nin the fight to pass ammunition to the firing line and carry back the\r\ndead and wounded. Somewhat removed from the zereba and trenches, and\r\nnearer the Nile were the hospitals, the transport, the stores, nearly\r\n3000 camels, and about 500 mules. The Egyptian cavalry and camelry\r\nwere picketed at the north of the camp, and the 21st Lancers at the\r\nsouth end, both being within the lines. All along the river's bank\r\nbeside the camp were moored the gunboats, steamers and barges, with a\r\nfleet of a hundred or more native sailing boats, at once a means of\r\ndefence and a supply column. The gunboat \"Melik\" was moored a few\r\nhundred yards south of where the Rifles were posted. Occasionally the\r\nflotilla flashed their search-lights upon Jebel Surgham, and swept the\r\nscrub and desert in front of the troops. The enemy's scouts, however,\r\nwere never disclosed in the radii of the electric beams. In fact, the\r\nfirst notice we had that the dervishes were about to inspect our\r\nenvironment was the impetuous incoming of our friendlies from Jebel\r\nSurgham and the cracking of snipers' guns in the bush mingled with the\r\nbuzzing of bullets overhead. A battalion rose quietly from the ground,\r\nfor the troops slept clear of the hedge, and went forward a few paces\r\nto man the zereba. On learning what was actually taking place they\r\nreturned to their blankets and to sleep.\r\n\r\nFor all the row the dervish spies, snipers and others made, the army\r\nwas not really disturbed. Once more we had to thank fortune that the\r\nenemy made no vigorous attempt to assail the camp during the night.\r\nTrue, earlier in the evening a few badly-directed rifle-shots had come\r\nwhistling across the zereba. Prowling dervish scouts had even\r\noccasionally crept close enough to draw upon themselves the attention\r\nof our double sentries and alert patrols. A small section volley at\r\none period of the night was fired at a knot of the enemy's would-be\r\nbush-whackers. The unusual rattle of musketry caused an incipient\r\nalarm in one of the battalions. Tommy, however, behaved well,\r\ncollectively, never stirring, but waiting \"for orders.\" The peace of\r\nthe night hours was, I repeat, never seriously broken, the\r\nAnglo-Egyptian army enjoying their needed sleep. After midnight things\r\nquieted down and from the dervish camp no sound was carried to us by\r\nthe soft south wind. All was absolutely still in that direction. The\r\nnoggara or war-drum was a dead thing, beating not to quarters, as we\r\nhad heard it during the day when out with the cavalry. Nor was the\r\ndeep-bayed booming of the ombeyas, or elephant horns, re-echoing to\r\nrally the tribesmen under their leaders' banners.\r\n\r\nIt was 3.40 a.m. on 2nd September when the bugles called the 22,000\r\nmen of the Sirdar's army from slumber. Quickly the troops were astir,\r\nand the camp full of bustling preparation. It was given out that we\r\nwere not to move forward quite as early as usual. But circumstances\r\nalter cases, and very soon loads and saddles were adjusted with extra\r\ncare. Everything was made as trim as possible, and belts were buckled\r\ntightly for action. There was a sense and expectancy of coming battle\r\nabroad, and an eager desire permeating all ranks to have it out with\r\nthe dervishes then or never. It had come at length to be generally\r\naccepted that the enemy would not bolt nor slip through our fingers,\r\nbut would accept the gage of battle which the Sirdar meant shortly to\r\ngive him. We were going to march out, attack, and storm the Khalifa\r\nand his great army in their chosen lines and trenches. In a way we\r\nfelt half-heartedly grateful to our sportsmanlike enemy for not having\r\nharassed our marches or bivouacs. We were, within the next hour or so,\r\nto have yet more to thank the dervishes and their Khalifa for. Truly\r\nAbdullah was amazingly ignorant of war tactics, or astoundingly\r\nconfident in the prowess of his arms. From the reckless, magnificent\r\nmanner in which the dervishes comported themselves in the earlier\r\nstages of the fight that ensued, I incline to the belief that the\r\nKhalifa and his men, true to their crass, credulous notions, were\r\noverweeningly confident in themselves. A fatal fault, they underrated\r\ntheir opponents. His Emirs, Jehadieh, and Baggara had so often proved\r\nthemselves invincible in their combats against natives of the Soudan,\r\nthat they had come to hold that none would face their battle shock.\r\nThere was pride of countless triumphs, and the long enjoyment of\r\ndespotic lordship that hardened their wills and thews to win victory\r\nor perish. I failed later to see the old fanaticism that once made\r\nthem, though pierced through and through with bayonet or sword, fight\r\ntill the last heart-throb ceased. Let me not be misunderstood. Despite\r\ntheir possible doubts about the Khalifa's divine mission, the dervish\r\narmy fought with courage and dash until they were absolutely broken.\r\nTheir personal hardihood bravely compared with the days of Tamai and\r\nAbu Klea. It was when the fight was nearly over that there were\r\nevidences of that of which there was so little in the old days, viz.,\r\nthat a large remnant would accept life at our hands. Again, as the\r\nsequel showed, the Sirdar's star was in the ascendant.\r\n\r\nEverything was in readiness in our camp by 5 a.m. Camels, horses,\r\nmules, and donkeys had been watered and fed, and the men had disposed\r\nof an early breakfast of cocoa or tea, coarse biscuit, and tinned\r\nmeat. Infantry and artillery had made sure of their full supply of\r\nammunition, and the reserve was handy to draw more from. Tommy Atkins\r\ncarried 100 rounds of the new hollow-nosed Lee-Metford cartridges.\r\nBehind him were mules loaded with a further twenty rounds for him. The\r\nKhedivial soldiers had 120 rounds of Martini-Henry cartridges. To hark\r\nback: at 4.30 a.m., ere dawn had tinged the east, the Sirdar bade\r\nColonel Broadwood, commanding the Egyptian cavalry, send out two\r\nsquadrons to ascertain what the enemy was about. Thereupon one\r\nsquadron rode off to the hills on the west--known locally as South\r\nKerreri jebels, but marked on most maps as Um Mutragan. Besides being\r\nmisnamed, they are plotted in out of place and as if the range trended\r\neast and west. It runs nearly north and south. Kerreri hills were low\r\nand black, like most of the jebels thereabout. They stand fully two\r\nmiles west of the Nile. Another squadron, under Captain Hon. E.\r\nBaring, proceeded south to Jebel Surgham, the low hill, about one mile\r\nin front of the British division. I have written about it before.\r\nSurgham was used for heliograph and flag signalling on the 1st, the\r\nprevious day, and is the last of the detached hills or ranges lying\r\nnear the river on the north towards Omdurman. The squadron going west\r\nsoon reached South Kerreri hill, and reported that the enemy were\r\nstill in camp. It was early, and not clear daylight, and the distance\r\nto the Khalifa's encampment was greater from South Kerreri hill than\r\nthat from Jebel Surgham to where the dervishes lay in the bush and\r\nhollows around Wady Shamba. Captain Baring's party, on the other hand,\r\nmet with small patrols of the enemy near Jebel Surgham. Turning the\r\nhill at a few minutes past five o'clock, in the yet slanting daylight,\r\nhe at once detected that the Khalifa's army, which had apparently been\r\nlargely reinforced during the night, was marching forward to attack\r\nus. Gallopers and orderlies came riding back furiously with the news\r\nfor the Sirdar. Sir Herbert Kitchener, Major-General Rundle, and the\r\nwhole headquarters staff were already mounted. Colonel Broadwood was\r\ndespatched to verify the startling report, and to bring in further\r\nparticulars. Meantime the preparations on our side for an advance\r\nwere suspended, and guns, Maxims, and infantry moved up and wheeled\r\ninto positions upon the firing line. Ominous was that silent march of\r\nsix paces to their front made by the British infantry to get close to\r\nthe zereba and the clearing for action of Maxims and cannon, and the\r\nexamining of the breeches of the Lee-Metfords. For the first time the\r\nmagazines were to be used. The Khedivial soldiers swarmed into their\r\ntrenches. Anon, the Tommy Atkinses were ordered to lie down behind\r\ntheir hedge of cut mimosa to rest and wait. From a little distance, no\r\ndoubt, our camp looked silent, deserted, and as void of danger as any\r\nother part of the plain. Standing a few yards behind each command were\r\nplaced in reserve sometimes two, sometimes three companies, which had\r\nbeen withdrawn from the battalion on their immediate front. These\r\nreserves were to fill gaps or stiffen the firing line, should it be\r\ntoo closely pressed. With the companies in reserve were the stretchers\r\nand bearers. A little farther back was the British divisional field\r\nhospital, planted in a congeries of native dirt-huts. The scattered\r\nmud-huts within the lines afforded excellent cover to the sick and\r\nwounded, as well as a degree of protection for the camels, horses,\r\nmules, and donkeys picketed near the middle ground of the camp.\r\n\r\nColonel Broadwood returned swiftly with the news that the whole\r\ndervish army was really in motion, and that if it held upon its\r\napparent course its right wing would pass about 500 yards to the west\r\nof Jebel Surgham. That hill was within easy shelling distance from\r\nthe gunboats, and the solitary instance of prudence that the dervishes\r\nhad so far shown was to keep far enough inland to render the\r\nassistance of the flotilla of as little help as possible to us. Some\r\nthere were who thought that Jebel Surgham should have been made the\r\ncentral stronghold of our camp, and that the army ought to have slept\r\nbehind it on the previous night. The wisdom of that suggestion was\r\nmost doubtful. Where we were the gunboats could more easily cover the\r\nwhole position.\r\n\r\nIt was about 5 a.m. when the 21st Lancers started forward to undertake\r\ntheir daily task of scouting and covering the left flank of the\r\nSirdar's army. They reached Jebel Surgham a few minutes later and\r\nrelieved Captain Baring's squadron, which at once rode away and joined\r\nthe remaining squadrons of Egyptian cavalry on South Kerreri hill,\r\nwhither Colonel Broadwood had by that time gone with his troopers.\r\nEvery inch of Surgham hill and the yellow sand ridges, gravel mounds,\r\nand shallow khors to the south and west of it had been explored by the\r\nLancers the day before. Riding straight out from the zereba ere the\r\nfaintly-glowing dawn had come, I joined the Lancers on Surgham. A\r\ndismounted squadron occupied part of the southern slopes, a troop or\r\nmore were on the higher points and summit keeping sharp eyes on the\r\nenemy. Flag-signallers were preparing for work at the place where the\r\nday before helios had been busy flashing news from gunboats and\r\ncavalry to the headquarters. As I climbed the rugged slopes of Jebel\r\nSurgham leading my horse, I heard a mighty rumbling as of tempestuous\r\nrollers and surf bearing down upon a rock-bound shore. When I had gone\r\nbut a few strides farther there burst upon my sight a moving,\r\nundulating plain of men, flecked with banners and glistening steel.\r\nWho should count them? They were compact, not to be numbered. Their\r\nfront from east to west extended over three miles, a dense mass\r\nflowing towards us. It was a great, deep-bodied flood, rather than an\r\navalanche, advancing without flurry, solidly, with presage of power.\r\nThe sound of their coming grew each instant louder, and became\r\narticulate. It was not alone the reverberation of the tread of horses\r\nand men's feet I heard and seemed to feel as well as hear, but a\r\nvoiced continuous shouting and chanting--the dervish invocation and\r\nbattle challenge, \"Allah el Allah! Rasool Allah el Mahdi!\" they\r\nreiterated in vociferous rhymed rising measure, as they swept over the\r\nintervening ground. Their ranks were well kept, the serried lines\r\nmarching with military regularity, with swaying of flags and\r\nbrandishing of big-bladed, cruel spears and two-edged swords. Emirs\r\nand chiefs on horseback rode in front and along the lines,\r\ngesticulating and marshalling their commands. Mounted Baggara trotted\r\nabout along the inner lines of footmen. There were apparently as\r\nbefore five great divisions in the dervish army. The Khalifa's corps\r\nwas near the right centre, with his son, Sheikh Ed Din's division on\r\nhis left. The relative positions of the great chiefs were readily\r\nrecognisable by their banners, which were carried in the midst of\r\ntheir chosen body-guards. Khalifa Abdullah's great black banner,\r\nblack-lettered with texts from the Koran and the Mahdi's sayings, was\r\nupheld by his Mulazimin. It flew, spread out, flaunting in the wind,\r\nacclaimed by his followers. The flag was about two yards square, and\r\nwas supported on a 20-feet bamboo pole, ornamented at top with a\r\nsilver bowl and spandrel, as well as a tassel. The force marching with\r\nit must have numbered 20,000 armed men, besides servants and\r\nfollowers. His son, Osman, known as Sheikh Ed Din, and the nominal\r\ncommander-in-chief of the dervish armies, led into battle a division\r\nof the Jehadieh (riflemen) and spearmen, together 15,000 strong. His\r\nforce was ranged under blue, green, yellow, and white banners. With\r\nhim was Khalil, the second Khalifa, Osman Azrak, Emir Yunis, Abdel\r\nBaki, and other noted chiefs of the Baggara. Yacoub, the notorious\r\nbrother of the Khalifa Abdullah, commanded the big column upon his\r\nrelative's right hand. Still farther to their right were the divisions\r\nled by Wad Helu and Wad Melik. The joint forces of these twain\r\nprobably numbered 12,000 or 14,000 men. Besides the main army there\r\nwas a second line, possibly made up from the Omdurman populace, with a\r\nbaggage train of camels and donkeys. I found out subsequently that the\r\nenemy were amply provisioned. Camels and donkeys carried water and\r\ngrain, mostly dhura, for the Khalifa's army. The dervishes, as a rule,\r\nhad their goatskin wallets filled with grain, onions, and a piece of\r\nroasted meat.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Omdurman began at 5.30 a.m. with a salvo of six guns\r\nfrom Major Elmslie's battery on the east Nile bank. They were fired\r\nfrom the 5-inch howitzers, which sent a half-dozen of 50-lb. Lyddite\r\nshells hurtling around the tomb and the Khalifa's quarters. Like a\r\nspouting volcano, clouds of flame, stones, and dust burst from out the\r\ncity. The line of strong forts before the town and upon Tuti island\r\nhad been silenced by them and the gunboats the previous day. Although\r\nthe dervishes had built stout works, and had plenty of cannon and\r\nammunition, they made a wretchedly bad stand against the gunboats,\r\ninjuring none of them. The overpowering weight as well as the accuracy\r\nof our steamers' fire ended the naval part of the battle almost as\r\nsoon as it was begun. Quick-firers and Maxims were trained to bear\r\ninto the embrasures of the Khalifa's forts. As a consequence, the\r\nenemy's gunners were only able to fire a few wild rounds at the\r\nvessels. Jealous and suspicious of everyone, Abdullah left his arsenal\r\nfull of unemployed batteries, Krupps, and machine guns, and only took\r\nthree of either of the latter weapons with him into the field against\r\nus. After the labour too of taking them there, he made but little use\r\nof them. As I learned, the Greeks, some thirty-five, and all\r\nable-bodied men, had to march out of Omdurman and follow the Khalifa\r\nto battle. I by no means, I think, over-estimate the enemy's numbers\r\nwhen I state that there were 50,000 dervishes of sorts who advanced\r\nagainst us, sworn to leave not a single soul alive in the Sirdar's\r\narmy. Abdullah, professedly sanguine of success, had bade the mollahs\r\nand others attend him at noon prayers in the mosque and Mahdi's tomb,\r\nwhere he would go to worship immediately after his victory. He had\r\nreturned into town, and spent part of the night of 1st and 2nd\r\nSeptember in his own house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF OMDURMAN--ZEREBA ACTION.]\r\n\r\nThe gunboats, which had gone on that morning, joined in the renewed\r\nbombardment of Omdurman, begun by Major Elmslie. But it was only for a\r\nshort space, for the Sirdar recalled the steamers by signal to assist\r\nin repelling the attack when it was seen the Khalifa meant giving\r\nbattle. Three squadrons of Lancers halted on the northern side of\r\nJebel Surgham. A troop of them pushed on to the sandy ridges\r\nsouth-west of Surgham hill. Part of them dismounted, and with much\r\nhardihood began firing at about 1000 yards' range at the oncoming\r\ndervishes. It was as if a few men afoot were seeking to interpose to\r\nhold back the invading ocean. Instantly dervish riflemen and horsemen\r\nshot out from the Khalifa's lines and came streaming to engage the\r\nhandful of troopers. The skirmishing Lancers desisted, mounted, and\r\nrode back to their main body. Of those of the Lancers who stood it out\r\nlongest were the groups upon the top of Surgham and upon its eastern\r\nside. Colonel Martin got his four squadrons together as the dervishes\r\ndrew in towards him. The enemy's right was now thrown forward, facing\r\nstraight for the angle of the camp where the British division stood.\r\nAt a swinging gait came the vast army of Mahdism. I was still near\r\nSurgham and believed that I could discern the Khalifa himself in the\r\ncentre of a jostling, excited throng of footmen and horsemen. He was\r\nseated upon a richly caparisoned Arab steed, guarded on all sides by\r\nstalwart natives armed with rifles and swords. A troop of mounted\r\nEmirs in front and a big retinue of Baggara and other chiefs on\r\nhorseback riding behind surely proclaimed him to be Abdullah, the\r\nMahdi's successor. Far before him was borne his terrible black banner.\r\nAround him religious dervishes screamed, gesticulated, and shouted\r\n\"Allah's\" name, confident that they had come out to see the\r\nannihilation of the invading infidels. Had it not been long foretold\r\nthat the victorious battle would be fought at Kerreri, which ever\r\nafter should be known among the faithful as \"the death-field of the\r\ninfidels\"? Were not the white stones there already to mark our graves?\r\nI was fortunate to be able to scan the nearest of the dervish columns,\r\nfrom a distance of but 800 yards. The battle was about to open in\r\nfierce earnest. Away went the Lancers at the gallop, back to the\r\nzereba, but, edging towards the river, to clear our infantry's front\r\nand line of fire. It was around the left of the 2nd battalion of the\r\nRifle Brigade that the troopers passed in. I took a somewhat shorter,\r\nhasty cut, entering the zereba near where the three batteries stood,\r\non the British left. Away off upon and under Um Mutragan, the Egyptian\r\nmounted troops, the nine squadrons of cavalry, eight companies of the\r\nCamel Corps, and the horse artillery, all under Colonel Broadwood,\r\nwere pluckily endeavouring to tackle the left wing of the Khalifa's\r\nforces. They held on, perhaps, too long; at any rate, until most of\r\nthem were in a position of serious danger. As their fight and the more\r\nimportant general action happened at the same time, I must defer\r\nfurther description of it for the moment.\r\n\r\nIt was a magnificent spectacle that rose before the Sirdar's army as\r\nthe dervish columns came sweeping into view, filling the landscape\r\nbetween Surgham and Um Mutragan. In that great multitude were gathered\r\nthe fiercest, most sanguinary body of savage warriors the world has\r\never held or known. Arabs and blacks, chosen by Abdullah himself,\r\npicked out because of their tried courage, strength, and devotion--the\r\nflower of the fighting Soudan tribes. Under other conditions\r\nAbdullah's army might have matched itself to win against double their\r\nnumber of any men similarly armed. Fearless of danger, agile yet\r\nstrong, each man carried with him into the fight the conviction that\r\nthe Khalifa would conquer. A great shout of exultation went up from\r\nthe dervish legions when they saw, ranged in the low ground before\r\nthem, the Sirdar's, small army, their imagined prey. There was a\r\nmighty waving of banners and flashing of steel when, breaking into a\r\nrun, they bent forward to close upon us. The British division rose to\r\ntheir feet to be ready, and the Khedivial troops closed up their\r\nranks. There was a murmur of satisfaction from Gatacre's division and\r\nreal cries of delight from the black troops on seeing the enemy were\r\ncoming to attack. Never was there a grander, more imposing militant\r\ndisplay seen than when the great dervish army rushed to engage,\r\nheedless of life or death. In an instant the Sirdar, who stood near\r\nthe right of Wauchope's brigade, passed an order for the three\r\nbatteries on the left--Major Williams', Stewart's, de Rougemont's--to\r\nopen fire. The guns were laid at 2800 yards, a range the delight of\r\ngunners, and sighted to the west of Surgham, where the black flag and\r\nthe largest mass of the enemy were. The hour was 6.35 a.m. Almost at\r\nthe first shot the true range was found. Quick as thought thereafter\r\nthe eighteen guns on our left began raining fire, iron, and lead upon\r\nthe leading and main columns of the enemy. Two batteries to the right\r\nand many of the Maxims added to the fury of the fearful death-dealing\r\nstorm bursting over and amongst the dervish ranks. The long 15-pounder\r\nEnglish field cannon hit with the precision of match rifles, and were\r\ndischarged as though they had been quick-firing guns. As for the\r\nstinging Maxim-Nordenfeldts, with their big single and bigger double\r\nshells, they bucked and jumped like kicking horses, yet were fired so\r\nfast that the barrels must have been well-nigh red-hot. The air was\r\ntorn with hurtling shell at the first awful salvo, when shrapnel burst\r\nin all directions, smiting the dervishes as with Heaven's\r\nthunderbolts, and strewing the ground with maimed and dead. The\r\nleading columns paused as if they had received a shock, or had stopped\r\nto catch breath. Hundreds had been slain in that one discharge, and\r\nthe fire was rapidly increasing, not slackening. Disregarding their\r\ndead and wounded, the dervishes closed their ranks as with one accord,\r\nand came on with fresh energy. Their banner-bearers and the Baggara\r\nhorsemen pushed to the front, doubtless to further encourage the still\r\ndauntless footmen. Surely there never was wilder courage displayed.\r\nIn the face of a fire that mowed down battalions and smashed great\r\ngaps into their columns they flinched not nor turned. Noticing the\r\nenemy's persistency, the Sirdar sent bidding General Lyttelton try\r\nthem with long-range volleys from the Lee-Metfords. Major Lord Edward\r\nCecil took the message, and Lieutenant H. M. Grenfell got the range\r\nfrom the gunners. The Grenadier Guards, who had the honour of being\r\nthe first of our infantry to engage, were ordered to fire section\r\nvolleys to their right at the Khalifa's division; the range 2700\r\nyards. Standing up and pointing their rifles over the hedge they\r\nblazed away very steadily at the dervishes. Occasionally they caught\r\nand slew a group, but at that period it was difficult to make out,\r\neven through good field-glasses, whether the infantry fire was really\r\neffective. There was no doubt about what the gunners were doing, for\r\nhorses and riders and footmen were bowled over or sank to the ground\r\nas shrapnel and common shell struck their ranks. The artillerymen\r\ninvariably trained their weapons to bear upon the front of the densest\r\nof the dervish columns, seeking to pulverise them. As for the\r\nMaxims--and I closely watched the effect of their fire through my\r\nglasses--I am compelled to say that they often failed to settle upon\r\nthe swarming foe. At any rate, their effectiveness was not equal to\r\nwhat might have been expected. Would the Khalifa succeed, in the face\r\nof such an awful cannonade, in reaching the zereba with a corporal's\r\nguard? But after all, it usually takes tons of iron and lead to kill a\r\nman. There was marvellous vitality in the dervish masses. Thousands\r\nwere knocked over by the screaming, bursting shells, which made hills\r\nand plain ring with thunderous uproar. But numbers of the apparently\r\nkilled were merely wounded, and they speedily rose and truculently\r\nhastened forward anew with their fellow-tribesmen. A diversion that\r\ntold momentarily in the enemy's favour occurred. The extreme dervish\r\nright at that moment appeared climbing the slopes of Jebel Surgham.\r\nEmir Melik's wing, hidden from view by that intervening high ground,\r\nhad, as it came on, been reinforced by a part of Yacoub's division. By\r\nother accounts Osman Digna, as well, had united forces with Melik.\r\nThere suddenly sprang into threatening proximity before us, a force of\r\nat least fifteen odd thousand men, with a wide surf-line of white,\r\nred, and gold lettered banners, less than a mile away. Brandishing\r\ntheir weapons and shouting \"Allah!\" down the slopes they ran towards\r\nthe zereba. Emirs rode in front, and gaunt, black riflemen sped like\r\nhounds, keeping pace with the horses. The guns of one battery, then\r\nanother, and finally all three, upon General Lyttelton's left, were\r\nturned upon them. Maxims also were swung round, and the long-distance\r\nvolleys were dropped for shorter ranges. The dervish main columns\r\nwhich had got shelter in low khors re-appeared, and without pause\r\njoined in the hot rush for our zereba. Our elated foemen evidently\r\nthought they would at last be able to close with us. In their\r\nignorance they reckoned not with the accuracy and discipline of the\r\nBritish infantry fire. Nor had they then learned to dread the\r\nterrible bullets of our men's Lee-Metford rifles. Later in the day, as\r\nwell as on the following one, I heard many expressions of regret from\r\nwounded and unwounded dervishes that they were so mad as to charge the\r\nwhite soldiers, whose bullets rarely missed. The light was good, the\r\nhour about 7 a.m., and the ranges shifted rapidly from 1700 yards to\r\n1500 yards, 1200 yards down to 1000 yards. Guns, Maxims, and rifles\r\nwere blazing in fullest fury at the enemy, as, in their heroic effort,\r\nthey sought to charge home upon us. From wing to wing Gatacre's\r\ndivision was firing sharply, a blaze of flame, section volleys and\r\nindependently. The Grenadier Guardsmen's shooting was noted as\r\nconspicuously steady and deadly effective. Except the two companies of\r\nthe Rifles on the left, who, owing to the nature of the ground on\r\ntheir front, could do little, the British infantry were hotly\r\noccupied. Rifles became too warm to be held, and were in some cases\r\nchanged for those of rear-rank men's. In one or two instances the\r\nreserves closed up, to give every soldier an opportunity of being\r\nactually engaged. They took the place of sections in the firing lines,\r\nwhilst their comrades fell back and refilled their cartridge pouches.\r\nThe Lancers sent forward a dismounted squadron or two which filled the\r\ngap between the zereba and the Nile, whilst the gunboats \"Melik\" and\r\n\"Sultan\" moved in and took part in that stage of the battle. And still\r\nthe dervishes got nearer, swinging up their left, for their right was\r\nnow fairly held by the British fire. Colonels Maxwell's and Lewis's\r\nbrigades had to address themselves to the task of checking the\r\nKhalifa's attack. Colonel Long had so disposed the cannon and Maxims\r\nthat the guns rendered invaluable help. At that period the main body\r\nof the dervishes moved forward more carefully, taking cover and\r\nevidently watching the issue of Yacoub's and Wad Melik's assaulting\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\nThe army of white flags, led by Yacoub and Wad Melik, exhibited dash,\r\ncourage, and persistence. Never was a column of men so hammered and\r\nmutilated and probably so surprised. They were torn and thrown about\r\nas puppets before the hurricane of shell fire, and laid in windrows\r\nlike cut grain before the hail of the Lee-Metfords. Twelve hundred\r\nshort yards away, Surgham's bare slopes were being literally covered\r\nwith corpses and writhing wounded. In sheer blundering brutishness,\r\nthe ferocious dervishes tried to stem the storm. Wave followed wave of\r\nmen, they surged together, inviting greater disaster, but always\r\nstriving to get nearer us. Their front had covered the whole slopes of\r\nJebel Surgham and their left overlapped part of the Khalifa's right.\r\nDeath was reaping a gigantic harvest. Hecatombs of slain were being\r\nspread everywhere in front. The fight was terrible, the slaughter\r\ndreadful. So far we had scarcely suffered loss, only a few of the\r\nenemy's riflemen having paused and thought of firing at us. Muskets\r\nthey had discharged in the air, after their manner, when advancing\r\nfrom their encampment. But that is one of their customs, employed to\r\nwork up a proper warlike ardour. Viewed from our side, it had been so\r\nfar the least dangerous battle ever soldier bore part in. For five,\r\nten minutes, less or more--the drama being enacted was too fearful and\r\nfascinating for one to take note of time--Yacoub and his legions still\r\nstrove to breast the whirlwind of destruction involving them.\r\nBattered, torn, rent into groups, the survivors at length began to\r\nmove off rapidly across our front, to their left. As yet there was no\r\nrunning away, they were but changing direction and massing at another\r\npoint. With, if possible, swifter, deadlier fire they were followed\r\nand driven. Maxims, Lee-Metfords, and Martini-Henrys from Maxwell's\r\nbrigade shattered the loose and weakened dervish columns. The few\r\nrounds fired back at us by the enemy from their Krupp gun and rifled\r\ncannon, which were stationed near the Khalifa's banner during the\r\nfirst part of the action, did no harm. In fact, their shells burst two\r\nor three hundred yards short of the zereba. At first they were\r\nmistaken for badly-aimed shells fired by the gunboats, from which a\r\nfew pitched near us, or by the batteries upon our left. For a moment\r\nthe Sirdar was wroth at what was fancied to be our gunners' blundering\r\npractice. It was quickly discovered, however, that the particular\r\nshells in question were aimed by the dervishes. Very soon,--whether\r\nsettled by our guns, our Maxims, or by infantry volleys, I know\r\nnot,--the dervish cannon and their foolish efforts to shell our lines\r\ntroubled us no more. We knew afterwards that they had also got one of\r\ntheir 5-barrelled Nordenfeldts to work for a while. Nobody in our\r\nranks, I think, was actually aware of the fact at the time, so\r\nindifferent was the aiming and so bad the handling of the gun.\r\n\r\nStill, the crucial stage of the first action was not over. The Sheikh\r\nEd Din had driven the Egyptian cavalry and Camel Corps from Um\r\nMutragan, inflicting loss upon them and getting temporary possession\r\nof several guns of the horse battery. He was following them up\r\nvigorously, and the Camel Corps, protected by the gunboats' fire, was\r\nseeking shelter near the river and close to the north end of the\r\nzereba, where it luckily succeeded in getting. It was after seven\r\na.m., and Colonel Broadwood's troopers were trying to shake off\r\nflanking parties of the enemy as they rode to the north, towards our\r\nprevious camp. Our batteries were still pounding the Khalifa's main\r\nbody, which had got to within 1400 yards of the south-western angle of\r\nthe zereba. Wavering, and driven before the murderous tornado of\r\nexploding bombs and pitiless lead, they too swung round and made for\r\ncover beyond range, flying towards the west and slightly to the rear.\r\nYacoub and Melik followed the black flag in the same direction, and\r\nthe dervish left wing edged off to Um Mutragan. They had come, first\r\nof all, direct, as if intending to assault the western angles of the\r\nzereba. Then Yacoub and Melik had led them to the right, so that they\r\ncovered Surgham and came on in front of the British division. Blindly\r\nthey had stumbled into the impassable fire from the south face of our\r\nlines and ultimately relinquishing the task had hastened, as I have\r\nstated, across our front towards their main body. The guns and Maxims\r\nwithal of Wauchope's and Maxwell's infantry, must have weakened the\r\nhope in the Khalifa's breast of closing with us. Although the range\r\nwas longer, the central columns had been subjected to almost as\r\ndestructive a cannonading as the dervishes on Surgham's slopes got. So\r\nfar it had been a gunner's day, and to the artillery in the\r\npreliminary stages, if not--with one exception--in the later, belonged\r\nthe full honours of the fight. At length with one mind, banner-bearers\r\nand all, swiftly the dervish columns, remaining intact, faced to the\r\nleft, and moved behind the western hills. There was a pause, a respite\r\nfor some minutes, which their jehadieh and others left upon the field\r\nof battle profited by to crawl upon their stomachs to within 800 yards\r\nless or more of the zereba, and open a sharp rifle fire upon us.\r\nVolley firing and shell firing dislodged many of them, but others kept\r\npotting away, increasing our casualty returns, particularly in the\r\n1st, or Wauchope's brigade. Just then the battle broke out with\r\ngreater fury than ever. What happened in the dervish army may be\r\nguessed. Out of immediate danger and re-formed, the Khalifa and Yacoub\r\ndetermined upon a second attack. With a rush like a mountain torrent\r\nthree columns spouted from shallow ravines, and at a break-neck run\r\ncame forward. Part of Wad Melik's men uprose from the west sides of\r\nSurgham, the Khalifa and Yacoub came upon us from the south-west, and\r\na smaller body from the west. In half delirium and full frenzy on\r\nrushed the dervishes. Our guns, knowing the range to a nicety--for\r\nthey were able to see landmarks put down the day before--hurled at\r\nthem avalanches of shell. The vivid air blazed and shook, and the\r\nhail of Lee-Metfords cut, like mighty scythes, lanes in the columns\r\nmassed ten-deep. Greater resolution and bravery no men ever possessed.\r\nIn face of destruction and death they continued their wild race. But\r\nthey were thinning or being thinned as they drew nearer. When about\r\n1100 yards away a body of horsemen, two hundred or so, the Khalifa's\r\nown tribesmen, Taaisha Baggara, chiefs and Emirs, setting spurs to\r\ntheir horses charged direct for the zereba. Cannon and Maxims smashed\r\nthem, infantry bullets beat against and pierced through them. At every\r\nstride their numbers diminished, horses and riders being literally\r\nblown over or cut and thrown down. Undaunted a remnant held on to\r\nwithin two or three hundred yards of Colonel Maxwell's line, where the\r\nlast of the gallant foemen tumbled and bit the dust. Partly encouraged\r\nby the self-sacrificing devotion of the horsemen, the footmen\r\nfollowed. The black flag was carried to within 900 yards of Colonel\r\nMaxwell's left. Learning from their earlier failure, the Khalifa's men\r\ndirected their attack upon the Egyptian troops. But the British\r\ndivision's cross-fire smote them, and the guns and Maxims knocked all\r\ncohesion out of their ranks. Still defiantly they set their standards\r\nand died around them. Then I noted there were again signs of wavering\r\namongst the main body, who were hanging back. The big black flag was\r\nstuck in a heap of stones, and the more devoted sought to rally there.\r\nAbdullah himself and his chiefs endeavoured to collect the broken\r\ncolumns. It was attempted in the face of a bombardment that would have\r\nshaken a city, and a fusilade that ought to have mown down every\r\nblade of halfa-grass near. But Maxwell's men seemed not quite to get\r\nthe range. The flag and flagstaff were riddled with bullet holes, and\r\nthe dead were being piled around. Still, dervish after dervish sprang\r\nto uphold the black banner of Mahdism. A herculean black grasped the\r\nstaff in one hand, and leaned negligently against it for what appeared\r\nto be the space of five or ten minutes,--probably less than one\r\nminute,--ere the soldiers managed to give him his final quietus. Then\r\nit was that the remnant of the army of the Khalifa began to melt away.\r\nIt was more than human nature could bear. The dense columns had shrunk\r\nto companies, the companies to driblets, which finally fled westward\r\nto the hills, leaving the field white with jibbeh-clad corpses like a\r\nlandscape dotted with snowdrifts.\r\n\r\nIt was about eight o'clock, and the first action was virtually over\r\nand won. Good fortune, as the Sirdar admitted, had in many respects\r\nattended him. With a trifling loss of a few hundred men he had\r\ndiscomfited and slain 10,000 of the great dervish army. Presumably,\r\nAbdullah had lost the flower of his brave and devoted troops. There\r\nwere yet a thousand or more of Jehadieh lying about under cover\r\npotting at the zereba. Many of them shammed being wounded to get\r\ncloser to us. Sharp volleys and more shell-fire duly disposed of those\r\ndetermined snipers. It was from that source, during the critical\r\nstages of the battle when the infantry were stopping the Khalifa's\r\ncolumns, that our chief casualties occurred. Some of these\r\nsharpshooters crept to within 800 yards of the British lines, and up\r\nto 400 yards from Maxwell's. It was from them that Captain Caldecott\r\nreceived his death-wound and the Cameron losses came. I could not but\r\nobserve the fact, as I walked and rode about behind the firing lines\r\nduring the action. Still, the battle of Omdurman has the right to be\r\nconsidered from the victor's point of view the safest action ever\r\nfought. The Warwick loss in the first action was one officer killed\r\nand two men wounded; the Camerons, one man killed and two officers and\r\neighteen men wounded--Colonel Money had two horses shot under him, as\r\nat the Atbara; the Seaforths had eighteen men wounded; and the\r\nLincolns ten men wounded. In General Lyttelton's brigade the Grenadier\r\nGuards had one officer, Captain Bagshot, and four men wounded; the\r\nNorthumberland Fusiliers had but one man wounded; the Lancashire\r\nFusiliers four men wounded; and the Rifles six men wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF OMDURMAN--_Continued._\r\n\r\nTHE CAVALRY FIGHTS--MACDONALD'S SAVING ACTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I deal with the second phase of the battle, there is something\r\nmore to be said of the first. So far I have but written of the\r\ninfantry and the artillery. It is no easy task to give a succinct\r\naccount of a whole catalogue of events happening at the same time over\r\nso widespread a field. The battle of Omdurman was full of incident and\r\nof Homeric combats. Whilst we in the zereba were awaiting, ready and\r\nconfident of the issue, the oncoming of the enemy, the two regiments\r\nof Egyptian cavalry and the Camel Corps, which had advanced on the\r\nright to Um Mutragan hills,--South Kerreri jebels,--like the 21st\r\nLancers at El Surgham on the left were opposing the dervish advance.\r\nTheir orders were to check the dervish left. The nine squadrons of\r\ntroopers with Colonel Broadwood remained on the plain, but the Camel\r\nCorps, seven companies, with four Maxims, and the horse battery went\r\nup the west shoulder of one of the Um Mutragan hills. As the dervishes\r\nwere advancing very rapidly, the four Maxims under Captain Franks\r\nwere recalled into the zereba before they had fired a shot, or ere\r\nthe mounted troops got into action. Three dismounted squadrons of\r\nEgyptian troopers thereupon went forward and temporarily occupied the\r\nposition which had been assigned to the Maxims. The Camel Corps were\r\nalready afoot, and had lined the crest and slopes of the hill, waiting\r\nto fire as soon as the Mahdists came within range. When the big\r\ncolumns of the dervishes, led by the Sheikh Ed Din, Khalifa Khalil and\r\nAli Wad Helu, approached nearer, Major Young's horse battery of six\r\nguns began shelling them at 1500 yards range. The Camel Corps then\r\nopened a sharp fusilade, and within a few minutes a brisk fight was\r\ngoing on. But the enemy neither halted nor stayed in face of the fire.\r\nIt only served to quicken their pace, and they ran forward shooting\r\nrapidly the while. An order was sent to the Camel Corps to retire at\r\nonce, as the dervishes were seen to be trying to cut them off by\r\nadvancing on both sides of the hill. Before the order carried by\r\nLieutenant Lord Tullibardine actually reached them, they had suffered\r\nseverely and were falling back. A large number of men and camels had\r\nbeen hit. The cavalry endeavoured to relieve the pressure. Ultimately,\r\nthough hotly pressed by the dervishes who got to within a few hundred\r\nyards, the Horse Artillery and the Camel Corps took up a second\r\nposition upon a ridge fully half a mile to the rear. From the zereba\r\nwe could see that the mounted troops were being hurried, and that the\r\naction taking place was an exceedingly sharp one. In fact, before the\r\nguns and the Camel Corps got into position upon the second ridge, the\r\ndervishes were firing at them from the summit and slopes of Um\r\nMutragan. Major Young had only fired a round or two from his guns when\r\nthe enemy were but 600 yards off. The dervishes were swarming along\r\nthe eastern sides of Um Mutragan, running direct for the guns and the\r\nCamel Corps. Colonel Broadwood formed his cavalry up to charge, and\r\nMajor Mahan led his regiment of \"Gippy\" troopers forward. But a\r\ndetachment of the Camel Corps under Captain Hopkinson pluckily stood\r\ntheir ground, covering the retirement of their comrades and the\r\nbatteries down the very rough slope. Unfortunately, Captain Hopkinson\r\nwas severely wounded, and a native officer and a number of men were\r\nkilled. Falling back along the east and north sides of the hill the\r\nforce was sorely pressed by the enemy, and a series of brave and\r\nbristling hand-to-hand encounters took place. Near the crest of a\r\nhill, one of the \"wheelers\" of the horse battery was shot. The traces\r\ncould not be cut in time, so the gun had to be abandoned. At the\r\ncritical moment another gun collided with it, and was upset beside the\r\nfirst, so both pieces, with, later on, a third, fell temporarily into\r\nthe dervishes' hands. They did nothing with them. Colonel Broadwood,\r\non finding the enemy pushing so determinedly, as though they had\r\nstruck the whole of the Sirdar's army, directed the Camel Corps to\r\nretire to the zereba. Luckily, two of the gunboats, getting sight and\r\nrange of the eager dervishes who were hunting the camelmen, began\r\nfiring with every piece of armament they could bring to bear. I\r\nassume they saved the situation, for the Camel Corps were hard\r\npressed, and lost eighty men before they got to the river and into a\r\nsafe position under the shelter of the gunboats and Macdonald's\r\nbrigade, which was at the north end of the zereba. The myth of a Camel\r\nCorps as a useful fighting unit had been exploded. Meantime, Colonel\r\nBroadwood's troopers rode away to the north, trying to shake off\r\noutflanking parties of dervishes. The Sheikh Ed Din and Khalil\r\ncontinued to pursue the cavalry with great eagerness and venom.\r\nSeveral times bodies of 200 and 300 Baggara horsemen threatened to\r\ncharge, but Majors Mahan and Le Gallias turning upon these riders sent\r\nthem flying back helter-skelter. For five miles the cavalry was, so to\r\nspeak, driven from pillar to post by the dervish infantry. When the\r\npursuit had been pressed four miles, and more, north of the zereba,\r\nMajor Mahan succeeded in clearing the flanks, whereupon the dervishes\r\ngave up the chase and sat down to rest. One advantage came of the\r\nhot-headed pursuit; it led two columns of the enemy away, and only a\r\nportion of those dervish commands got back in time to engage in the\r\nassault upon the zereba.\r\n\r\nWhen the Khalifa Abdullah, who escaped being killed, retired with his\r\nshattered army after their futile attack behind the western hills a\r\nlittle south of Um Mutragan, it was thought that the fighting spirit\r\nhad been knocked out of the enemy. There was no assurance that if the\r\nSirdar and his men followed after the Khalifa the dervishes would risk\r\na second battle. They had the legs of us, and would presumably use\r\nthem to run away, or to harass us if we went after them into the\r\nwilderness. Discreetly and shrewdly the Sirdar decided to march his\r\narmy straight into Omdurman, but six miles distant. We were able to\r\nmove upon inside lines and over open ground, so that if the Khalifa\r\nmeant to race us for the place he would have to fight at a\r\ndisadvantage. The command was issued about 8.30 to prepare to march\r\nout of camp for Omdurman. Our wounded, who had been borne from the\r\nfield on stretchers, were put upon the floating hospitals. Colonel\r\nCollinson's brigade was told off to guard stores and material to be\r\nleft behind for a time. Ammunition was drawn from the reserve stores\r\nafloat, and the supply columns' boxes were refilled, as well as the\r\nbattery limbers and the men's pouches. The army was again equipped for\r\naction as though it had not fired a shot. Camels were reloaded, and\r\nall was in readiness for a start. We could see bodies of the enemy\r\nstill flaunting their banners, and watching our every movement from\r\nthe western hills. Wounded dervishes were crawling and dragging\r\nwearily back from their fated field towards Omdurman. There was the\r\noccasional crack of a rifle as some dervish sniped us, or invited a\r\nshot from the Egyptian battalions. Many of our black soldiers actually\r\nwept with vexation on being withdrawn from the firing line to make\r\nroom for guns and Maxims. One man, who declared he had not fired a\r\nshot, was only comforted on being assured that the battle was not\r\naltogether over, that his chance would come later.\r\n\r\nI think it was about 9 a.m. when the Sirdar's army, re-formed for\r\nmarching, stepped clear of the zereba and the trenches. The order of\r\nadvance for the infantry was as before, in echelon of brigades, the\r\nBritish being on the left and in front. Lyttelton's 2nd brigade was\r\nleading, Wauchope's was behind it. On the right were Maxwell's and\r\nLewis's brigades. Macdonald was to look after our extreme right rear\r\nflank, whilst Collinson followed in the gap nearer the river.\r\nLyttelton's brigade was directed to pass to the left, east of Jebel\r\nSurgham, Maxwell's left was to extend to and pass over the hill,\r\nwhilst Lewis and Macdonald would sweep part of the valley between\r\nSurgham and South Kerreri. Such was the general direction to be taken,\r\nexposing a front measured on the bias, of fully one mile. Once more\r\nthe 21st Lancers trotted out towards Jebel Surgham to make sure there\r\nwere no large bodies of the enemy in hiding. Keeping somewhat closer\r\nto the river than previously, and avoiding the main field of battle,\r\nthey passed to the east of the hill. Part of their duty was to check,\r\nif possible, any attempt of the enemy to fall back into Omdurman, or\r\nat least delay such an operation. Great numbers of scattered dervishes\r\nwere seen, some of whom fired at the troopers. Keeping on until about\r\nhalf a mile or more south of Surgham, a small party of dervish\r\ncavalry, about thirty, and what was thought to be a few footmen, were\r\nseen hiding in a depression or khor. Colonel Martin determined to push\r\nthe party back and interpose his regiment between them and Omdurman. A\r\nfew spattering shots came from the khor, as the four squadrons formed\r\nin line to charge. \"A\" squadron, under Major Finn, was on the\r\nright, next it was \"B\" squadron, commanded by Major Fowle. On the left\r\nof \"B\" was \"D,\" or the made-up squadron, led by Captain Eadon, and \"C\"\r\nsquadron, under Captain Doyne, was on the extreme left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A.\r\n\r\nGENERAL VIEW PLAN.\r\n\r\nMACDONALD'S FIGHT AND 21ST LANCERS' CHARGE.]\r\n\r\nLeading the regiment forward at a gallop from a point 300 yards away,\r\nthe Lancers dashed at the enemy, who at once opened a sharp musketry\r\nfire upon our troopers. A few casualties occurred before the dervishes\r\nwere reached, but the squadrons closed in and setting the spurs into\r\ntheir horses rushed headlong for the enemy. In an instant it was seen\r\nthat, instead of 200 men, the 21st had been called upon to charge\r\nnearly 1500 fierce Mahdists lying concealed in a narrow, but in places\r\ndeep and rugged, khor. In corners the enemy were packed nearly fifteen\r\ndeep. Down a three-foot drop went the Lancers. There was a moment or\r\nso of wild work, thrusting of steel, lance, and sword, and rapid\r\nrevolver shooting. Somehow the regiment struggled through, and up the\r\nbank on the south side. Nigh a score of lances had been left in\r\ndervish bodies, some broken, others intact. Lieutenant Wormwald made a\r\npoint at a fleeing Baggara, but his sabre bent and had to be laid\r\naside. Captain Fair's sword snapped over dervish steel, and he flung\r\nthe hilt in his opponent's face. Major Finn used his revolver, missing\r\nbut two out of six shots. Colonel Martin rode clean through without a\r\nweapon in his hand. Then the regiment rallied 200 yards beyond the\r\nslope. Probably 80 dervishes had been cut or knocked down by the\r\nshock. But the few seconds' bloody work had been almost equally\r\ndisastrous for the Lancers. Lieutenant R. Grenfell and fifteen men had\r\nbeen left dead in the khor. It so happened that the squadrons on the\r\ntwo wings had comparatively easy going and did not strike the densest\r\ngroups of the enemy. Squadrons \"D\" and \"B\" fared badly, and\r\nparticularly Lieutenant Grenfell's troop, of whom ten men fell with\r\nthat officer. In their front was a high rough bank of boulders, almost\r\nimpassable for a horse. They were cut down and hacked by the enemy.\r\nHis brother, Lieutenant H. M. Grenfell, subsequently recovered his\r\nwatch, which had been thrust through by a dervish lance point and had\r\nstopped at 8.40 a.m. Young Robert Grenfell was probably struck from\r\nbehind with a Mahdist sword blade, and killed instantly as his charger\r\nwas endeavouring to scramble up the wall of loose stones and rock.\r\nMelees were taking place to right and left, every trooper having any\r\ndifficulty in getting out of the khor being instantly surrounded by\r\nmounted dervishes and footmen. Lieutenant Nesham in leading his troop\r\nwas savagely attacked. His helmet was cut off his head, and he was\r\nwounded severely upon the left forearm and right leg. The bridle reins\r\nof his charger were cut, but he piloted the animal safely through. \"B\"\r\nand \"D\" squadrons lost respectively nine killed and eleven wounded,\r\nand seven killed and eight wounded. Lieutenant Molyneux, R.H.G., had\r\nhis horse knocked over. He called to a trooper not to leave him, and\r\nthe man replied, \"All right, sir, I won't leave you.\" Together they\r\nhad a busy time. Two dervishes attacked the lieutenant; he shot one,\r\nbut the other cut him over the right arm, causing him to drop his\r\nrevolver. He then ran for it and got away. Lieutenants Brinton and\r\nPirie received wounds. Private Ives of \"A\" squadron picked up a\r\nwounded comrade in the nullah, and got chased and separated from his\r\nregiment. He reached the infantry covered with his comrade's blood.\r\nThe latter was killed, but Ives was not seriously hurt.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Montmorency, having got through safely, turned back to look\r\nfor his troop-sergeant Carter. Captain Kenna went with him. At the\r\nmoment they were not aware that young Grenfell had fallen. Lieutenants\r\nT. Connally and Winston Churchill also turned about to rescue two\r\nnon-commissioned officers of their respective troops. They succeeded\r\nin their laudable task. Surgeon-Captain Pinches, whose horse had been\r\nshot under him on the north side of the khor, was saved by the pluck\r\nof his orderly, Private Peddar, who brought him out on his horse.\r\nMeanwhile, Captain Kenna and Lieutenant Montmorency, who were\r\naccompanied by Corporal Swarbrick, saw Lieutenant Grenfell's body and\r\ntried to recover it. They fired at the dervishes with their revolvers,\r\nand drove them back. Dismounting, Montmorency and Kenna tried to lift\r\nthe body upon the lieutenant's horse. Unluckily, the animal took\r\nfright and bolted. Swarbrick went after it. Major Wyndham, the second\r\nin command of the Lancers, had his horse shot in the khor. He was one\r\nof the few who escaped after such a calamity. The animal fortunately\r\ncarried him across, up, and beyond the slope ere it dropped down\r\ndead. Lieutenant Smith, who was near, offered him a seat, and the\r\nMajor grasped the stirrup to mount. Just then--for these events have\r\ntaken longer in telling than in happening--Montmorency and Kenna found\r\nthe dervishes pressing them hard, both being in instant danger of\r\nbeing killed. Swarbrick had brought back the horse, and Kenna turned\r\nto Major Wyndham and gave him a seat behind, then leaving Grenfell's\r\nbody they rejoined their command. Proceeding about 300 yards to the\r\nsouth-east from the scene of the charge, Colonel Martin dismounted his\r\nwhole regiment, and opened fire upon the dervishes. Getting into\r\nposition where his men could fire down the khor, a detachment of\r\ntroopers soon drove away the last of the enemy. Thereupon a party\r\nadvanced and recovered the bodies of Lieutenant Grenfell and the\r\nothers who had fallen in the khor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B.\r\n\r\nTHE ZAREBA BEFORE THE BATTLE.]\r\n\r\nIt was a daring, a great feat of arms for a weakened regiment of 320\r\nmen to charge in line through a compact body of 1500 dervish footmen,\r\npacked in a natural earthwork. Perhaps it is even a more remarkable\r\nfeat that they were able to cut their way through with only a loss of\r\n22 killed and 50 officers and men wounded and 119 casualties in\r\nhorseflesh. Many of the poor beasts only lived long enough to carry\r\ntheir riders out of the jaws of death. One cannot refuse to admire the\r\ngallant deed, which probably had as good an effect upon the enemy as a\r\nbigger victory of our arms; but the obvious comment will be that made\r\nabout the Balaclava charge--equally heroic, and not, I honestly think,\r\nless useful--\"C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre.\" On\r\nsearching the ground inside the khor sixty dead dervishes were found\r\nwhere the central squadrons passed over. A small heap lay around\r\nLieutenant Grenfell and his troop. Four of our men were found alive,\r\nbut died before they could be moved. A sword-cut had cleft young\r\nGrenfell's head and given him a painless death. The bodies were, as\r\nusual, full of sword-cuts and spear-thrusts inflicted by the enemy\r\nbefore and after the victims had breathed their last.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGYPTIAN HEROISM.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACDONALD'S BRIGADE ADVANCING.]\r\n\r\nIt is a long tale I am telling, but yet the most brilliant and heroic\r\nepisode of a day so full of glowing incident remains to be told. About\r\n9.20 a.m. the Sirdar led his troops slowly forward towards Omdurman.\r\nGreat as the slaughter had been, thousands of dervishes could be seen\r\nstill watching us from the western hills. Behind them they had\r\nre-formed again into compact divisions. The Sirdar's direction, I have\r\nsaid, was that his troops were to swing clear of the zereba and march\r\nin echelon with the 2nd British brigade leading Moving out a few\r\nhundred yards, Lyttelton's brigade, which, as before, marched in four\r\nparallel columns of battalions, the Guards on the right, swung to the\r\nleft. They were making to pass Surgham, leaving it upon their right.\r\nThe 1st British brigade, Major-General Wauchope's, was behind, and had\r\nturned to the left to follow the 2nd brigade. Behind, in succession,\r\nwere Maxwell's, Lewis's, and Macdonald's Egyptian or Khedivial\r\nbrigades. The nature of the ground forced some of them out of their\r\ntrue relative positions. Macdonald had marched out due west. The\r\ndervishes, like wolves upon the scent for prey, suddenly sprang from\r\nunexpected lairs. With swifter feet and fiercer courage than ever they\r\ndashed for the comparatively isolated brigade of Colonel Macdonald.\r\nAlthough I was far away at the moment with the 1st or Lyttelton's\r\nbrigade, the shouts, the noise of the descending tornado reached me\r\nthere. From behind the southern slope of Um Mutragan hills the Khalifa\r\nwas charging Macdonald with an intact column of 12,000 men, the\r\nbanner-bearers and mounted Emirs again in the forefront. A broad\r\nstream, running from the south and the east, of dervishes who had lain\r\nhidden sprang up and ran to strike in upon the south-east corner of\r\nMacdonald's brigade. Worse still, Sheikhs Ed Din and Khalifa\r\nKhalil, returned from chasing the Egyptian cavalry, were hastening\r\nwith their division at full speed to attack him in rear. Scarcely a\r\nsoul in the Sirdar's army, from the leader down, but saw the\r\nunexpected singular peril of the situation. I turned to a friend and\r\nsaid, \"Macdonald is in for a terrible time. Will any get out of it?\"\r\nThen I rode at a gallop, disregarding the venomous dervishes hanging\r\nabout, up the slopes of Surgham, where, spread like a picture, the\r\nscene lay before me. Prompt in execution, the Sirdar rapidly issued\r\norders for the artillery and Maxims to open fire upon the Khalifa's\r\nbig column. Eagerly he watched the batteries coming into action. At\r\nthe same moment the remaining brigades were wheeled to face west, and\r\nMajor-General Wauchope's was sent back at the double to help the\r\nstaunch battalions of Colonel Macdonald, now beset on all sides.\r\nFortunately Macdonald knew his men thoroughly, for he had had the\r\ntraining of all of them, the 9th, 10th, 11th Soudanese, and the 2nd\r\nEgyptians under Major Pink. No force could have been in time to save\r\nthem had they not fought and saved themselves. Lewis's brigade was\r\nnearest, but it was almost a mile away, and the dervishes were wont to\r\nmove so that ordinary troops seemed to stand still. And Lewis, for\r\nreasons of his own, determined to remain where he was.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIRDAR DIRECTING ADVANCE ON OMDURMAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: C.\r\n\r\nPLATE I.\r\n\r\nMACDONALD'S BRIGADE.\r\n\r\nFIRST ATTACK. KHALIFA'S DIVISION.]\r\n\r\nIndecision or flurry would have totally wrecked Macdonald's brigade,\r\nbut happily their brigadier well knew his business. An order was sent\r\nhim which, had it been obeyed, would have ensured inevitable disaster\r\nto the brigade, if not a catastrophe to the army. He was bade to\r\nretire by, possibly, his division commander. Macdonald knew better\r\nthan attempt a retrograde movement in the face of so fleet and daring\r\na foe. It would have spelled annihilation. The sturdy Highlandman\r\nsaid, \"I'll no do it. I'll see them d----d first. We maun just fight.\"\r\nAnd meanwhile Major-General A. Hunter was scurrying to hurry up\r\nreinforcements--a wise measure. Other messages which could not reach\r\nMacdonald in time were being sent to him by the Sirdar to try and hold\r\non, that help was coming. Yes; but the surging dervish columns were\r\nconverging upon the brigade upon three sides. Surely it would be\r\nengulfed and swept away was the fear in most minds. And what other\r\nwreck would follow? Ah! that could wait for answer. It was a crucial\r\nmoment. A single Khedivial brigade was going to be tested in a way\r\nfrom which only British squares had emerged victorious. Most\r\nfortunately, Colonel Long, R.A., had sent three batteries to accompany\r\nColonel Macdonald's brigade, namely, Peake's, Lawrie's, and de\r\nRougemont's. The guns were the handy and deadly Maxim-Nordenfeldt\r\n(12 1/2-pounders). Macdonald had marched out with the 11th Soudanese on\r\nhis left, the 2nd Egyptian, under Major Pink, in the centre, and the\r\n10th Soudanese on the right, all being in line. Behind the 10th, in\r\ncolumn, were the 9th Soudanese. Major Walter commanded the 9th, Major\r\nNason the 10th, and Major Jackson the 11th Soudanese battalions. Going\r\nforward to meet the Khalifa's force Colonel Macdonald threw his\r\nwhole brigade practically into line, disregarding for the moment the\r\nassaulting columns of Sheikh Ed Din, which providentially were a\r\nlittle behind in the attack. The batteries went to the front in\r\nopenings between the battalions and smote the faces of the dervish\r\ncolumns. Steadily the infantry fired, the blacks in their own pet\r\nfashion independently, the 2nd Egyptians in careful, well-aimed\r\nvolleys. Afar we could see and rejoice that the brigade was giving a\r\nmagnificent account of itself. The Khalifa's dervishes were being\r\nhurled broadcast to the ground. Major Williams at last with his\r\n15-pounders, our other batteries, and the Maxims were finding the\r\nrange and ripping into shreds the solid lines of dervishes. Still the\r\nenemy pressed on, their footmen reaching to within 200 yards of\r\nMacdonald's line. Scores of Emirs and lesser leaders, with spearmen\r\nand swordsmen, fell only a few feet from the guns and the unshaken\r\nKhedivial infantry. It is said one or two threw spears across the\r\nindomitable soldiery, and other dervishes turned the flanks, but were\r\ninstantly despatched. A few salvoes and volleys shook the looser\r\nattacking columns of dervishes. The Khalifa's division had at length\r\nreceived such a surfeit of withering fire that the rear lines began to\r\nhold back, and the desperate rushes of the chiefs and their personal\r\nretainers grew fewer and feebler. But Sheikh Ed Din was at length\r\nwithin 1000 yards running with his confident legions to encompass and\r\ndestroy the 1st Khedivial brigade. Macdonald, as soon as he saw that\r\nhe could hold his own against the whole array of the Khalifa's\r\npersonally commanded divisions, threw back his right, the 9th, and one\r\nand then another battery. He was now fairly beset on all sides, but\r\nfighting splendidly, doggedly. The dervishes, taking fresh courage,\r\nmade redoubled efforts to destroy him. It was by far the finest, the\r\nmost heroic struggle of the day. A second battalion, the famous\r\nfighting 11th Soudanese, under Jackson, which lost so heavily at\r\nAtbara, swung round and interposed itself to Khalil's and Sheikh Ed\r\nDin's fierce followers. Furious as was the blast of lead and iron, the\r\ndervishes had all but forged in between the 9th and 11th battalions,\r\nwhen the 2nd Egyptian, wheeling at the double, filled the gap. Without\r\nhesitation the fellaheen, let it be said, stood their ground, and,\r\nfull of confidence, called to encourage each other, and gave shot and\r\nbayonet point to the few more truculent dervishes who, escaping shot\r\nand shell, dashed against their line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: D.\r\n\r\nPLATE II.\r\n\r\nMACDONALD'S BRIGADE.\r\n\r\nSECOND ATTACK. SHEIKH ED DIN'S MEN.]\r\n\r\nIt was a tough, protracted struggle, but Colonel Macdonald was slowly,\r\ndeterminedly, freeing himself and winning all along the line. The\r\nCamel Corps came out to his assistance, and formed up some distance\r\noff on the right of the 11th Soudanese. Shells and showers of bullets\r\nfrom the Maxims on the gunboats drove back the rear lines of Sheikh Ed\r\nDin's men. Three battalions of Wauchope's got up to assist in\r\ncompleting the rout of the Khalifa. The Lincolns, doubling to the\r\nright, got in line on the left of the Camel Corps, and assisted in\r\nfinishing off the retreating bands of the Khalifa's son. I then saw\r\nthe dervishes for the first time in all those years of campaigns\r\nturn tail, stoop, and fairly run for their lives to the shelter of\r\nthe hills. It was a devil-take-the-hindmost race, and the only one I\r\never saw them engage in through half a score of battles. Beyond all\r\nelse the double honours of the day had been won by Colonel Macdonald\r\nand his Khedivial brigade, and that without any help that need be\r\nweighed against the glory of his single-handed triumph. He achieved\r\nthe victory entirely off his own bat, so to speak, proving himself a\r\ntactician and a soldier as well as what he has long been known to be,\r\nthe bravest of the brave. I but repeat the expressions in everybody's\r\nmouth who saw the wonderful way in which he snatched success from what\r\nlooked like certain disaster. The army has a hero and a thorough\r\nsoldier in Macdonald, and if the public want either they need seek no\r\nfarther. I know that the Sirdar and his staff fully recognised the\r\nnature of the service he rendered. A non-combatant general officer who\r\nwitnessed the scene declared one might see 500 battles and never such\r\nanother able handling of men in presence of an enemy. When the final\r\nrout of the dervishes had been achieved it was about 10 a.m. The\r\nSirdar wheeled his brigades to the left, into their original position,\r\nand marched them straightway towards Omdurman. Passing slowly over the\r\nbattle-field the awful extent of the carnage was made evident. In my\r\nfirst wires I insisted that our total casualties were about 500, and\r\nthe enemy's over 10,000 slain. Macdonald lost about 128 men. I\r\nsubsequently ascertained that the total of our killed and wounded was\r\nabout 524. The dervish killed certainly numbered over 15,000, and\r\ntheir wounded probably as many more. Mahdism had been more than\r\n\"smashed,\" it had been all but extirpated. So may all plagues end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KHALIFA'S CAPTURED STANDARD (SIRDAR EXTREME LEFT).]\r\n\r\nOn the march the British troops having to swing aside from where the\r\nKhalifa's black flag still stood, it fell into the hands of an\r\nEgyptian brigade, and was conveyed to the Sirdar by Captain Sir Henry\r\nRawlinson and Major Lord Edward Cecil. It was given to an Egyptian\r\norderly to carry behind the headquarters staff. Unfortunately, it\r\nattracted the attention of some of our own people on the gunboats who\r\nwere unaware it had been captured. Several rounds were fired at the\r\nsupposed dervishes following it, and then it was discreetly furled for\r\na time. By midday the army had arrived at the northern outskirts of\r\nOmdurman, where the troops were halted near the Nile to obtain food\r\nand water. I rode forward and saw that there were thousands of\r\ndervishes in the town, many of them Baggara. The cavalry were sent as\r\nspeedily as possible, after watering and feeding the horses, towards\r\nthe south side of the town, and the gunboats were ordered up the\r\nriver. Several deputations of citizens, Greeks and natives, came out\r\nand saw Slatin Pasha and the Sirdar. It was stated that the people\r\nwould surrender, and that there would be no difficulty in occupying\r\nthe place. The Khalifa, it was said, was in his house and must yield.\r\nSlatin Pasha, by the way, had gone over the battle-field and\r\nidentified many of the slain Emirs. At 4.20 p.m., with two batteries,\r\nseveral Maxims and Colonel Maxwell's brigade leading, the Sirdar rode\r\ndown the great north thoroughfare towards the central part of the\r\nsqualid town. The houses, or more accurately huts, were full of\r\ndervishes, hundreds of whom were severely wounded. Women and children\r\nflocked into the streets, raising cries of welcome to us. Of all the\r\nvile, dirty places on earth, Omdurman must rank first. There was no\r\neffort at sanitary observances, and dead animals, camels, horses,\r\ndonkeys, dogs, goats, sheep, cattle, in all stages of putrefaction,\r\nlay about the streets and lanes. There were dead men, women, and\r\nchildren, too, lying in the open.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHIEF THOROUGHFARE, OMDURMAN.\r\n\r\n(MULAZIM WALL, LEFT. OSMAN DIGNA'S HOUSE, RIGHT.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EFFECT OF SHELL FIRE UPON WALL (MULAZIM ENCLOSURE).]\r\n\r\nWe passed the big rectangular stone wall enclosing the Khalifa's\r\nspecial quarters. Within its area were his Mulazimin or body-guards'\r\nquarters, his granaries, treasuries, arsenal, the Mahdi's tomb, and\r\nthe great praying square, misnamed the Mosque. Except the tomb, the\r\nKhalifa's and his sons' houses, the town was void of buildings of any\r\nstyle or finish. I admit the great stone wall was of good masonry, and\r\nso was the well-finished praying-square wall. The Sirdar and party\r\nwere frequently shot at, particularly on nearing the Khalifa's\r\nquarters. Abdullah slipped out with his treasures as the Sirdar\r\narrived at his gate. It was long after sunset and dark when, with\r\ndifficulty, the prison was reached, and Charles Neufeld brought out\r\nof his loathsome den, where he had spent eleven years in chains. He\r\nlooked well, notwithstanding his long and irksome captivity, feeling,\r\nas he said, like a man drunk with new wine, on account of his release.\r\nThat night I helped to relieve him from his fetters, freeing the limbs\r\nfrom the heavy bar and chains. Tired, worn out, without water or food,\r\nthe Sirdar and his staff, as well as many more of us, were glad to\r\nescape out of Omdurman back to where the British camp was pitched in\r\nthe northern outskirts. There I and others lay down and fell asleep on\r\nthe bare desert, hoping to wake and find that our servants and\r\nbaggage had turned up. Two of my colleagues had fared worse than I\r\nthat day. Colonel F. Rhodes, of the _Times_, had been shot in the\r\nshoulder within the zereba early in the fight, and the Hon. Hubert\r\nHoward, of the _New York Herald_, was killed almost under my eyes, in\r\nthe paved courtyard of the Khalifa, opposite the Mahdi's tomb. Such is\r\nthe hasty record of as exciting and interesting a battle and a day's\r\ncampaigning as it ever fell to mortal man to witness. Neither in my\r\nexperience nor in my reading can I recall so strange and picturesque a\r\nseries of incidents happening within the brief period of twelve\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSTORIES OF THE BATTLE--OMDURMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are numberless incidents and details remaining untold of the\r\ngreat battle and the fall of Omdurman. So singular and interesting an\r\naction is almost without parallel. \"That villainous gunpowder\" of\r\nformer days was so sparingly used in the fight by the Sirdar's army\r\nthat every part of the battle-field could be plainly seen. In the\r\nfirst stage the heaviest firing was by the British; the Lee-Metfords\r\nwith cordite made little or no smoke. Maxwell's men of the Khedivial\r\narmy, with their Martini-Henrys, never fired so fast as to cause any\r\nthick white cloud to shut out the view and hang between them and the\r\nenemy. Lewis's and Macdonald's brigades were never very heavily\r\nengaged whilst the troops remained zerebaed. Perhaps it was the light\r\nsouth wind which blew the men's rifle smoke behind us at once, but\r\nthat was not what I thought. There seemed to be none to blow away. I\r\nrecall that in the thick of the battle of Tamai with Davis's square,\r\nand at Abu Klea, the smoke cloud that hung like a curtain before our\r\neyes was a source of danger. Save for the erratic, occasional whizzing\r\nof the enemy's bullets, the thud of a hit and the dropping, weltering\r\nin his blood, of a man here and there, watched from our firing lines\r\nthe combat enlisted and fascinated the attention with barely a\r\nsuggestion of danger to the onlooker. Few will ever see again so great\r\nand brave a show. A vast army, with a front of three miles, covering\r\nan undulating plain--warriors mounted and afoot, clad in quaint and\r\npicturesque drapery, with gorgeous barbaric display of banners,\r\nburnished metal, and sheen of steel--came sweeping upon us with the\r\nspeed of cavalry. Half-a-dozen batteries smote them, a score of Maxims\r\nand 10,000 rifles unceasingly buffeted them, making great gaps and\r\nrending their ranks in all directions. With magnificent courage,\r\nwithout pause, the survivors invariably drew together, furiously,\r\nfrenziedly running to cross steel with us. Their ardour and mad\r\ndevotion won admiration on all sides in our own ranks. Poor, misguided\r\nJehadieh and hocussed Arabs of the spacious and cruel Soudan! With\r\nsuch troops disciplined and trained by English officers the policing\r\nof Africa would be an easy affair. Try and try as they did, they could\r\nnot moving openly pass through our blasts of fire. Some few there were\r\nwho got by subtler means to within 600 yards of the British front and\r\n200 yards from Maxwell's blacks, there to yield their lives.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest, if not the first man, wounded in the zereba on 2nd\r\nSeptember was Corporal Mackenzie, of \"C\" Company Seaforth Highlanders.\r\nAbout 6.10 a.m. he was hit in the leg by a ricochet. The wound was\r\ndressed, and Mackenzie stuck to his post. At 6.30 a.m., when the\r\naction was almost in full swing, as Private Davis and Corporal Taylor,\r\nR.A.M.C., were carrying a wounded soldier upon a stretcher to the\r\ndressing hospital, Davis was shot through the head and killed, and\r\nTaylor was severely wounded in the shoulder.\r\n\r\nWhilst our batteries were hurling death and destruction from the\r\nzereba at the Khalifa's army, Major Elmslie's battery of 50-pounder\r\nhowitzers was battering the Mahdi's tomb to pieces and breaching the\r\ngreat stone wall in Omdurman. The practice with the terrible Lyddite\r\nshells was better than before, and the dervishes, even more clearly\r\nthan we, must have seen from the volcanic upheavals when the missiles\r\nstruck, that their capital was being wrecked. It must have been\r\nsomething of a disillusion to many of them to note that the sacred\r\ntomb of their Mahdi was suffering most of all from the infidels' fire.\r\nSeveral of the gunboats assisted in the bombardment, but their chief\r\nduty was to drive all bodies of the enemy away from the river. Major\r\nElmslie threw altogether some 410 Lyddite shells into Omdurman. Most\r\nof them detonated, but there were a few that merely flared. It was the\r\nfumes from these that imparted a chrome colour to the surrounding\r\nearth and stonework. Why the Khalifa did not make greater use of his\r\nartillery and musketry became more of a puzzle than ever when we saw\r\nhow well provided he was in both respects. He had a battery of\r\nexcellent big Krupps that were never fired, besides eight or ten\r\nmachine guns. As for rifles, his men must have carried at least 25,000\r\ninto action against us. Had they employed these in \"sniping\" as at\r\nAbu Kru, the Sirdar would have had to march out and attack them.\r\n\r\nThe victory of Omdurman owed much to the masterly serving of the\r\nartillery. Even in Macdonald's severely contested action, the three\r\nbatteries of Maxim-Nordenfeldt 12 1/2-pounders did much to save the\r\nsituation. These were Peake's, Lawrie's, and de Rougemont's, with, in\r\nthe latter part of the fight, three Krupp guns of the horse artillery.\r\nThe Camel Corps also brought up two Maxims to help at the close of the\r\nbattle to repulse Sheikh Ed Din. Macdonald handled his guns as\r\nsuperbly as he did his infantry. At the Atbara against Mahmoud, the\r\nlight powerful Maxim-Nordenfeldts had proved that they could be\r\nsuccessfully fought side by side with infantry. Between the battalion\r\nintervals, therefore, the dauntless gunners stood firing point-blank\r\nat the dervish columns. Throughout the battle Major Williams' 32nd\r\nField Battery, R.A., fired 420 rounds. Three of the Maxim-Nordenfeldt\r\nbatteries (all Egyptian) fired 100 rounds per gun, whilst Major\r\nLawrie's battery, No. 4 Egyptian, also Maxim-Nordenfeldt guns, fired\r\nover that number, or 900 rounds in all. All these batteries were of\r\nsix guns each. Captain Smeaton fired from his six Maxims, stationed in\r\nthe zereba south-east corner, 54,000 rounds. One of the wants much\r\nfelt by the gunners was the need of more shrapnel during the action.\r\nTwice at least the allowance supply was temporarily exhausted. Yet it\r\nis not to be assumed on that account that the reserve ammunition was\r\ndifficult to be got at or that the firing lines were insufficiently\r\nfed. The arrangements in these respects were admirable. During the\r\nzereba action, the Grenadier Guards fired the largest number of\r\nrounds. The Camerons fired 34 rounds per man. Five companies of the\r\nLincolns in the firing line, 32 rounds each man. The Northumberland\r\nFusiliers fired in all 1200 rounds, and the Lancashire Fusiliers 400\r\nrounds.\r\n\r\nMany of our wounded were hit with bullets from elephant guns, brass\r\ncased Mausers, Remingtons, and repeating rifles. The great majority of\r\nthe dervishes carried Remingtons, and these, as a rule, were in\r\npassably good condition. Probably they were officers or crack shots\r\namong the Jehadieh and Arabs that fired into the zereba with the small\r\nbore Mausers. Most of their shooting was too high, though the\r\ndirection was right enough. When the first phase of the action ceased\r\nat 8.30 a.m., hundreds, if not thousands of wounded dervishes upon the\r\nfield rose and moved away. Some of these were seen going back towards\r\nOmdurman, others walked towards the west to rejoin their friends. No\r\nattempt was made on our side to molest them, the order to \"cease fire\"\r\nhaving been given. It was either then or a little earlier that the\r\nlarge body of natives, possibly camp followers, behind the Khalifa's\r\nforce, melted away, flowing back to the town. At that time some of our\r\narmy camp followers, or servants, went forward from the zereba to pick\r\nup trophies from the field. A party of four went towards a small group\r\nof dead dervishes lying about 300 yards on the left front of Maxwell's\r\nbrigade. I noticed them picking up spears and swords. A correspondent\r\nrode out to join them, Mr Bennett Stanford, who was formerly in the\r\n\"Royals.\" In company with another colleague I rode out from the\r\nBritish lines to join him, curious to see the effect of our fire. At\r\nthe moment a dervish arose, apparently unwounded, and spear in hand\r\ncharged the servants, who incontinently bolted back to the zereba. My\r\ncompanion also turned back, but I was yet over 200 yards away, and so\r\nrode forward. One of the men attacked by the dervish was a native\r\nnon-commissioned officer. He had followed the others out. Dropping\r\nupon his knee he aimed at the dervish, but his Martini-Henry missed\r\nfire. He fired again and missed, then, the dervish being very near\r\nhim, ran for the zereba. Mr Bennett Stanford, who was splendidly\r\nmounted, with a cocked four-barrelled Lancaster pistol aimed\r\ndeliberately at the dervish, who turned towards him. Waiting till the\r\njibbeh-clad warrior was but a score of paces or so off, Mr Stanford\r\nfired, and appeared to miss also, for the dervish without halt rushed\r\nat him, whereupon he easily avoided him, riding off. Then the dervish\r\nturned to the soldier who, encumbered with his rifle, did not run\r\nswiftly. By that time I had drawn up so as to interpose between them,\r\npassing beyond the dervish. I pulled up my rather sorry nag--my best\r\nwas for carrying despatches--and took deliberate aim. The dervish\r\nturned upon me as I wished. I fired and believe hit him, and as my\r\nhorse was jibbing about fired a second shot from my revolver with less\r\nsuccess, then easily got out of the dervish's reach. He had a heavy\r\nspear and showed no sign of throwing it as I rode away, keeping well\r\nout of his reach. The camp followers by then were all safe, and so was\r\nthe native soldier, Mr Dervish having the field very much to himself.\r\nThereupon an A.D.C., Lieutenant Smyth, came galloping out and riding\r\nhard past, fired at the fellow but missed. Checking his horse\r\nLieutenant Smyth wheeled it about, and he and the dervish collided.\r\nThe man, who by this time appeared somewhat weak, grabbed the\r\nLieutenant and strove to drive his lance into him. With great\r\nhardihood Lieutenant Smyth fired his revolver in the dervish's face,\r\nkilling him instantly. It was a wondrous narrow escape for the\r\nLieutenant. The instant afterwards I asked him if he had been badly\r\nwounded, but he declared that he was untouched, a statement I could\r\nscarcely credit, and so repeated my question in another form, to\r\nreceive a similar answer. In the excitement of the moment he no doubt\r\ndid not feel the slight spear wound he actually received upon the arm,\r\nwhich saved him from the thrust aimed at his body. An examination of\r\nthe dead dervish showed he had received four bullet wounds.\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief and well-balanced account of the charge of\r\nthe Lancers furnished me by an officer who was present:--\"We moved\r\nalong to the left--_i.e._, east of Surgham--following up the enemy on\r\nthat flank. Our object was to prevent them retiring into Omdurman or,\r\nat any rate, delay their retreat. A body of dervishes were seen\r\ncrouching not far off to the right. Colonel Martin determined to push\r\nthe enemy back and interpose between them and the town. The regiment,\r\nof four squadrons, was wheeled into line. When 300 yards off we\r\nstarted to charge, and were met by a heavy musketry fire from the\r\nenemy. At first it was ill-directed, but very soon casualties occurred\r\nin our ranks from it. Instead of a few dervishes, we tumbled upon over\r\n500 hidden in a fold of the ground. They were in a khor, or nullah,\r\ninto which we had to drop, and they lined it twenty deep in places.\r\nOur weight, however, carried us through. The dervishes, when we struck\r\nthem, did not break, but \"bunched\" together, showing no fear of\r\ncavalry. There was half a minute's hacking, cutting, spearing, and\r\nshooting in all directions; then we cleared them, and rallied on the\r\nfar side. Halting about 300 yards off, men were dismounted, and we\r\nopened a sharp fire from our carbines on the enemy, driving them to\r\nthe westward in ten minutes. The charge was really successful in its\r\nobject, as the retirement from that part of the field into Omdurman\r\nwas stopped. We left perhaps sixty dervishes on the field in the\r\ncharge, and killed about 100 more with our subsequent fire.\" The\r\ndervish leader who was sitting on a fine black Dongolawi horse was\r\nkilled in the melee. A trooper met him in the khor and ran him through\r\nwith his spear.\r\n\r\nBy far the finest feature of that morning of battles was the action\r\nfought by Colonel Macdonald with his brigade. The dervish forces that\r\nsought to crush him numbered fully 20,000 men. To oppose them he had\r\nbut four battalions, or in all less than 3000 Soudanese and Egyptian\r\nsoldiers. With a tact, coolness, and hardihood I have never seen\r\nequalled, Colonel Macdonald manoeuvred and fought his men. They\r\nresponded to his call with confidence and alacrity begotten of long\r\nacquaintance and implicit faith in their leader. He had led several of\r\nthe battalions through a score of fierce fights and skirmishes, always\r\nemerging and covering himself and his men with glory, honour and\r\nvictory. All of them knew him, they were proud of him, and reposed\r\nimplicit confidence in their general. Unmistakably the Khalifa and his\r\nson, the Sheikh Ed Din, thought that their fortunate hour had\r\ncome--that, in detail, they would destroy first Macdonald, then one by\r\none the other Khedivial brigades. What might have been, had father and\r\nson arrived at the same time and distance on both sides of Macdonald,\r\nas they evidently intended, I will not venture to discuss. Happily the\r\nonslaughts of the wild, angry dervishes did not quite synchronise, and\r\nColonel Macdonald was able to devote virtually his whole firing\r\nstrength to the overthrow of the Khalifa's division ere rapidly\r\nturning about first one then another of his battalions to deal with\r\nthe Sheikh Ed Din's unbroken columns. The enemy on both sides got very\r\nclose in, hundreds of them being killed almost at the feet of the men\r\nof the 1st Khedivial brigade. Dervish spears were thrown into and over\r\nthe staunch and unyielding Soudanese and Fellaheen soldiery. Peake's,\r\nLawrie's, and de Rougemont's batteries stood their ground, side by\r\nside with the infantry, never wavering, firing point-blank upon the\r\ndervish masses. Majors Jackson, Nason, and Walter were, as usual,\r\nproud of the steadiness of their blacks--the 11th, 10th, and 9th\r\nbattalions--whilst Major Pink, of the 2nd Egyptian, was elated with\r\nthe stout way his soldiers doubled, wheeled, and at a critical moment\r\nrushed to fill up a gap near one of the batteries. The \"Gippies\"\r\nlooked without flinching straight into the eyes of the dervishes, and\r\nfired volleys that would have done credit to a British regiment. The\r\nhulking, physically strong \"Fellah\" had at last taken the measure of\r\nhis enemy, and meant to prove himself the better man of the two. And\r\nhe did--delighted with himself and his comrades, calling to them,\r\nchiding the dervishes, and stepping out of the ranks to meet the\r\nonrush of those of the enemy who came near, to stop it with bullet or\r\nbayonet. But chief of all was Macdonald, going hither and thither and\r\nissuing his orders as if on parade, with a sharp snap to each command.\r\nTwo armies saw it all, and one at least admired his intrepid valour.\r\nOne hundred black-flag Taaisha, the Khalifa's own Baggara tribesmen\r\nand part of his body-guard, charged impetuously. Spurring their horses\r\nto their utmost speed leading the footmen, down they came straight for\r\nthe brigade. Cannon, Maxims, and rifles roared, and, bold as the\r\nTaaisha rode, neither horse nor man lived to get within one hundred\r\nyards of our Soudanese and Gippies. Steady as a gladiator, with what\r\nto some of us looked like inevitable disaster staring him in the face,\r\nColonel Macdonald fought his brigade for all it was worth. He quickly\r\nmoved upon the best available ground, formed up, wheeled about, and\r\nstood to die or win. He won practically unaided, for the pinch was all\r\nbut over when the Camel Corps, hurrying up, formed upon his right,\r\nafter he had faced about to receive the Sheikh Ed Din's onslaught. The\r\nLincolns, who arrived later on, helped to hasten the flight of the\r\nenemy, whose repulse was assured ere they or any of Wauchope's brigade\r\nwere within 1200 yards of Macdonald. Lewis's brigade were not even\r\nable to assist so much, and such outside help as came in time to be of\r\nuse was in the first instance from the guns of Major Williams' and\r\nanother battery, and the Maxims upon the left near Surgham hurried\r\nforward by the Sirdar himself, as I saw. General Hunter came over to\r\nthe headquarters-staff galloping to get assistance, and rode back with\r\nWauchope's brigade, which doubled for a considerable distance, so\r\nserious was the situation and nervous the tension of that thrilling\r\nten minutes. Had the brilliant, the splendid deed of arms wrought by\r\nMacdonald been done under the eyes of a sovereign, or in some other\r\narmies, he had surely been created a General on the spot. If the\r\npublic are in search of the real hero of the battle of Omdurman there\r\nhe is, ready made--one who committed no blunder to be redeemed by\r\ncourageous conduct afterwards. He boldly exercised his right of\r\npersonal judgment in a moment of extreme peril, and the result amply\r\njustified the soundness of his decision.\r\n\r\nIt was about 11.50 a.m. when the Sirdar wheeled his army about to\r\nresume the march upon Omdurman. The dervishes who had escaped\r\nslaughter had bent their bodies and run from the fatal field, going\r\nfar off behind the western range of hills. Moving slowly and in\r\nechelon, as when we first set out, we passed over part of the\r\nbattle-field. Groups of unwounded dervishes, who insisted on fighting\r\nand sniping the troops, had to be dealt with as well as all others who\r\npersisted in being truculent. Like everybody else at the head of the\r\ncolumn, I was shot at repeatedly. All of the enemy, however, who\r\nshowed the least disposition to surrender were left unmolested.\r\nHundreds of dervishes who had been wounded hobbled on in front of our\r\narmy. We could see the Khalifa's forces behind the hills watching us\r\nand streaming upon a parallel line towards Omdurman. But the dervishes\r\nwere no longer in compact military array or ranged in division under\r\nchiefs. They were mostly scattered in small groups and bands spread\r\nover a very wide area. It was a rabble, and had lost semblance of\r\nbeing an army with power of concerted action. When Macdonald's fight\r\nwas over, the Egyptian cavalry under Colonel Broadwood returned and\r\nformed up near the camelry. They, with the Camel Corps, moved forward\r\non the right as before during the final advance upon the Khalifa's\r\ncapital. Men and horses had done a week of the hardest kind of work,\r\nbut both were yet willing and full of spirit. As for the 21st Lancers,\r\nthe few mounts remaining fit for work scarcely counted as a cavalry\r\nforce. The gunboats and the infantry saw to our left, which was not\r\ndifficult, for upon that hand the country was quite bare. About 2 p.m.\r\nthe army reached the northern outskirts of Omdurman, the British\r\ndivision upon the left. Gatacre's men were nearest the Nile, Maxwell\r\nand Lewis being almost opposite one of the main thoroughfares of the\r\ntown. A halt for water--the great necessity--food, and rest was\r\nordered. Parties were instantly detailed to fill water-bottles and\r\nfantasses, iron tanks. The cooks, too, got to work, and fires were\r\nkindled with wood torn from neighbouring huts, and a meal was\r\nprepared. Under the burning sunshine, down upon the loose dirt and\r\ngravel, officers and men sprawled to rest themselves. There was a very\r\nmuddy creek or inset near, and thither went thousands, parched with\r\nthirst, to drink, not hesitatingly but gulping down copious draughts\r\nof water, tough and thick as from a clay puddle. I wandered with my\r\nhorse a little way into the town, and ultimately down towards the main\r\nstream of the Nile, where the water was cleaner and cooler than by the\r\nhalting-place. There were plenty of dervishes to be seen about,\r\nlooking from lanes and walls, but they were far from being\r\nparticularly aggressive at that part of the town. Indeed, several\r\nlarge groups of men, Arabs and negroes, came up bearing white rags on\r\nsticks in front of them. I went forward and met parties of them, and\r\nadvised them to go into the British lines, where the soldiers would\r\nreceive them as friends. Watering my horse, I let him feed on grass by\r\nthe river's brink, filled my water-bottle, and then returned by a\r\ncircuitous route. The natives were not all inclined to be friendly,\r\nfor a few preferred shooting at the stranger. But their practice was\r\nvery bad.\r\n\r\nReturning to where the troops still lay, I found that a fresh movement\r\nwas afoot. Report had been brought that hundreds of lesser sheikhs and\r\nleaders were in the town ready to surrender with their followers if\r\ntheir lives would be spared. The assurance sought was quickly conveyed\r\nto them. Slatin Pasha, who had been indefatigable on the battle-field,\r\nwatching the course of events and locating the commands of the various\r\nimportant dervish chiefs, had received news that the Khalifa was still\r\nin the town. The Pasha, on passing over the field, had searched around\r\nthe black flag and other noted leaders' banners to see who lay there.\r\nIn the heaped dead about the Khalifa's flag he had seen Yacoub,\r\nAbdullah's brother, and many more leaders, but the arch head of\r\nMahdism, the Sheikh Ed Din and Osman Digna were nowhere to be found.\r\nAmongst the dead Emirs identified were Osman Azrak, leader of the\r\ncavalry, Wad el Melik, Ali Wad Helu, Yunis, Ibrahim Khalil, Mahmoud's\r\nbrother, el Fadl, Osman Dekem, Zaki Ferar, Abu Senab, Mousa Zacharia,\r\nand Abd el Baki. The Khalifa had come into action riding a horse. As\r\nthat did not suit him he changed for a camel and, finding the latter\r\nposition too dangerously conspicuous, rode off the field on\r\ndonkey-back. Perhaps the most concise summing up of the battle fell\r\nfrom a \"Tommy's\" lips: \"Them dervishes are good uns, and no mistake.\r\nThey came on in thousands on thousands to lay us out, but we shifted\r\nthem fast enough.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not quite four o'clock, afternoon. Slatin Pasha had got news\r\nfrom former friends that the fugitives and townspeople would gladly\r\nsurrender, so the sooner the Sirdar marched in and took possession the\r\nbetter. True, the Khalifa with several hundreds of followers, or\r\nmayhap a thousand or more, was yet within the central part of\r\nOmdurman. Most of his Jehadieh, it was urged, would give in at once if\r\nan opportunity were afforded them, and Abdullah could be caught. With\r\nMaxwell's brigade, Major Williams' battery and several Maxims, the\r\nSirdar and headquarters staff pushed along the wide thoroughfare that\r\nleads from the north past the west end of the great rectangular wall,\r\ntowards the Mosque inclosure and Mahdi's tomb. The infantry, guns, and\r\nMaxims preceded but a few paces in front. Vile beyond description was\r\nOmdurman, its dwellings, streets, lanes, and spaces. Beasts pay more\r\nregard to sanitation than dervishes. Pools of slush and stagnant water\r\nabounded. Dead animals in all stages of decomposition lay there in\r\nhundreds and thousands. There were besides littering the place camels,\r\nhorses, donkeys, dead and wounded fresh from the battle-field. And\r\nthere were many other ghastly sights. Dead and wounded dervishes lay\r\nin pools of blood in the roadway. Several of the dying enemy grimly\r\nsaluted the staff as we passed. An Emir who, horribly mauled by a\r\nshell, lay pinned under his dead horse waved his hand and fell back a\r\ncorpse. Our guns and Maxims had opened once or twice to turn the armed\r\nfugitives from the town. The compounds and huts were full of wounded\r\nand unwounded dervishes, most of the latter having Remingtons and\r\nwaist-belts full of cartridges, besides carrying spears and swords.\r\nIn the open thoroughfares there were many bodies of women and children\r\nlying stark and stiff. The majority of these victims were young girls.\r\nMany of the poor creatures had evidently been running towards the\r\nriver to try and escape when caught and killed by jealous and cruel\r\nmasters or husbands. The scenes were shocking, the smells abominable\r\nand quite overpowering to many who sought to ride in with the General.\r\n\r\nThere was something like a reception for the Sirdar on his entering\r\nthe town. The women and children, mostly slaves, filled the\r\nthoroughfares, and in their peculiar guinea-fowl cackling fashion\r\ncheered the troops. Notables in jibbehs, which they had not yet had\r\ntime to turn inside out, as nearly every native did afterwards, came\r\nand salaamed, smote their breasts, and kissed the hands and even the\r\ngarments' hem of the Sirdar and his staff. In truly Oriental fashion\r\nthey completed the ceremonial of obeisance and fealty by throwing dust\r\nupon their already frowsy enough heads. It was curious to watch the\r\nvarious recognitions extended to Slatin, and how the latter did not\r\nforget his old friends, who had been kind to him, or his Eastern\r\nmanners in exchanging courtesies. When they realised that we were not\r\ncannibals, which they did very quickly, and that the Khalifa and\r\nothers must have deceived them, they ran about amongst the troops. It\r\nwas with difficulty at times the ranks were kept clear of them. Our\r\nWestern leniency surprised them. The Sirdar shook hands with certain\r\nof the notables, including several of the Greeks and Jaalin. One of\r\nthe most extraordinary incidents was the appearance of the Khalifa's\r\nown band with drums and horns to play in the 13th Soudanese. Evidently\r\nit was a case of black relations, for they played the battalion, Major\r\nSmith-Dorian's, out as well as into town on the following day.\r\n\r\nThe people were ordered to carry the good news about that none who\r\ngave up their arms would be killed or hurt, and that there was no\r\nintention on our part to sack the town or injure anybody. What? A\r\ncaptured city in the Soudan not to be given over to the victorious\r\ntroops to do with as they liked! I am sure the natives of both sexes\r\nwere amazed. And I cannot say all looked quite satisfied at the\r\nannouncement. The crowd in the streets quickly increased; they\r\nevidently believed that we meant them no harm, and that they could do\r\nas they liked. In the bombardment the Lyddite shells had knocked down\r\na gateway leading into the buildings and square mile of town enclosed\r\nby the great rectangular stone wall built by the Khalifa. For a space\r\nof fifty yards, several big holes had been blown in the structure,\r\nwhich was fourteen feet high and over four feet in thickness. Some of\r\nthese breaches led into the beit-el-mal, or public granary. A few\r\nwretched, hungry slaves ventured to help themselves to the grain,\r\nchiefly dhura, that had partly poured out into the street. No one\r\ninterfered with them. Within half an hour all the women and children\r\nin the town apparently, to the number of several thousands, were\r\nrunning pell-mell to loot the granary. Men also joined in plundering\r\nthe Khalifa's storehouse. They ran against our horses, tripped over\r\neach other and fell in their crazy haste to fill sacks, skins, and\r\nnondescript vessels of all sorts--metal, wood and clay--with grain.\r\nWomen staggered under burdens that would assure their households of\r\nfood for months. It became a saturnalia and jubilee for the long,\r\nhalf-starved slaves, men and women. By-and-by looting became more\r\ngeneral. The houses of Emirs who had run away or been killed were\r\nentered and plundered by the populace. Donkeys were caught and loaded\r\nwith spoils of war, and driven off to huts on the outskirts near where\r\nthe troops bivouacked after their long and fatiguing day. During the\r\nearlier part of that night there was much noise and hubbub in Omdurman\r\nwith constant firing of rifles. Maxwell's men, however, assisted by\r\nnumbers of friendly Jaalin, finally succeeded in enforcing something\r\nlike order and peace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KHALIFA'S HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nAfter the reception near the centre of the town the Sirdar proceeded\r\nwith part of Colonel Maxwell's brigade along the west side of the big\r\nwall. Osman Digna's house was passed on the way. We got as far as the\r\nsouth-west corner into full view of the Mahdi's tomb, which was about\r\n400 yards to the east. In the same direction and equidistant was the\r\nKhalifa's house. Beside us was the Praying Square or Mosque, a space\r\nof bare ground of about ten acres or so in extent. As soon as the\r\ntroops got beyond the big wall and in sight of the tomb and Khalifa's\r\nhouse, a brisk fusilade from Remingtons by the Jehadieh body-guard\r\nprotecting Abdullah was opened against us. Fortunately, the big stone\r\nwall was not loopholed on either side. Indeed there appeared to be no\r\nprovision for its defenders to fire from it unless they mounted to\r\nthe top. The Sirdar and staff fell back, and the guns and Maxims went\r\nforward a little. Maxwell's men then dealt with the enemy, and the\r\nSirdar, still led by Slatin Pasha, whom the dervishes called\r\n\"Saladin,\" turned back to try and make his way through the breaches in\r\nthe north wall. Troops were sent in to clear the compound of\r\ndervishes, most of whom surrendered at once. But exit upon the south\r\nside was barred by interior walls and gates. Then the Sirdar essayed\r\ngoing along by the river's margin between the wall, the Nile, and the\r\nforts, to turn the south-east angle. A sharp and accurate fire from\r\nthe Jehadieh stopped that advance for a time. Gunboats were ordered\r\nforward to drive the dervishes from their cover. The soldiers pushed\r\nfarther through the compound, and the gunboats swept the Jehadieh with\r\nMaxims and quick-firing cannon. About 5 p.m., with the shadows rapidly\r\nlengthening, the rough way between the river and the great wall was\r\npartly cleared of the enemy. Thereupon the Sirdar and staff forded a\r\ndirty, wide creek, the crossing being girth high, and trotted a few\r\nhundred yards up stream. With double teams, four guns of the 32nd\r\nBattery, Major Williams', were got across the pool, accompanying the\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nEntering a gateway through the outer rectangular wall, the force moved\r\ntowards the Mahdi's tomb and the Khalifa's chief residence or palace.\r\nThe Sirdar and staff reined up before Abdullah's doorway, for the\r\ndervish leader's house was surrounded by an inner wall and various\r\nsmall buildings. We were in a higgledy-piggledy looking corner,\r\nsurrounded by rough shelters or stables for animals, horses and\r\ncamels, and the unfinished but covered approaches to the Mahdi's tomb.\r\nThe staff sat on horseback facing the doorway and dwelling; I pulled\r\nin opposite beside an angle of the wall. Upon the Sirdar's right were\r\nsome corrugated iron roofed sheds, and a little in front the Praying\r\nSquare. Behind was the Mahdi's tomb, and at no great distance various\r\nimportant dervish buildings. Abdullah had so planted himself that he\r\nhad easy and private access to all places of public resort as well as\r\nthe official quarters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAHDI'S TOMB--EFFECT OF LYDDITE SHELLS.]\r\n\r\nSlatin Pasha, Colonel Maxwell, and several soldiers, with one or two\r\nothers, went in and searched for the Khalifa. A few minutes previously\r\nhe had slipped out by a back door with the more important part of his\r\npersonal treasures. His harem had been sent away earlier in the day.\r\nMr Hubert Howard, correspondent of the _New York Herald_ and the\r\nLondon _Times_, was near the headquarters staff. He came over to where\r\nI was and chatted. To a companion who had joined me he offered some\r\ncigarettes. He said it had been a splendid day, and he had seen much.\r\nNothing could have been better than the way things turned out, and he\r\nwas glad he had been through it from first to last, cavalry charge\r\nincluded. Then he said he would like to get a photograph or two of the\r\nsurroundings and the Khalifa's house. I told him the light was spent\r\nand he could get no good results. He said he would try, and rode\r\ninside the courtyard. A minute or less later, there was the roar and\r\ncrash of a shrapnel shell, which burst over our heads in very\r\ndangerous proximity. The iron and bullets struck the walls and rattled\r\nupon the corrugated iron roofs alongside. \"That,\" I said to my\r\ncompanion and an artillery officer hard by, \"was one of our own guns.\"\r\nThe officer, Major Williams, I think, replied he feared indeed that it\r\nwas so. A similar opinion was apparently entertained by the Sirdar and\r\nstaff, for gallopers were sent to the officer in charge of the two\r\nguns of the 32nd Battery left on the west side of the wall in the main\r\nthoroughfare, to cease firing at once. Before riding up to the\r\nKhalifa's door the Sirdar had hailed the gunboats, and one of them,\r\nthe \"Sultan,\" came near enough inshore for us to converse with those\r\non board and for the commander to receive orders to stop all firing at\r\nAbdullah's quarters. A few seconds after the first shrapnel burst,\r\nanother pitched over our heads, aimed apparently like the previous one\r\nat the Khalifa's compound. Indeed, it appeared so later, for those of\r\nour men at the south-west corner of the wall saw a number of armed\r\nJehadieh who were gathering behind Abdullah's compound. The Maxims\r\nalso opened fire on what was probably a body of the enemy covering\r\nAbdullah's retirement, and who, at any rate, were firing at the\r\ntroops. Immediately after the second shell exploded the Sirdar and\r\nheadquarters rode off, returning by the road we entered, to the main\r\nthoroughfare upon the west side of the enclosing wall. I remained a\r\nfew minutes longer, two shells bursting overhead in the interval, and\r\nwith my companion retraced our steps, rejoining the headquarters'\r\nfollowing. Mr Hubert Howard was struck upon the side of the head by a\r\nbullet or fragment of a shell and killed instantly. His body was\r\nremoved and covered up by Colonel Maxwell and his men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR MAHDI'S TOMB (GRILLE AROUND SARCOPHAGUS).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KHALIFA'S GALLOWS (CUTTING DOWN HIS LAST VICTIM).]\r\n\r\nArrangements were made for the instant pursuit of the Khalifa, who, I\r\nwas told, only left his palace about five o'clock or sometime after we\r\nhad penetrated into Omdurman. Notables and dervishes who came in to us\r\nwere freely used by the staff to run hither and thither conveying\r\nintimation to all their friends, that the war being over they should\r\nlay down their arms. In that way the news of the collapse of Mahdism\r\nwas widely spread, and bands of thirty and forty of the Jehadieh and\r\neven of the Baggara surrendered. The presence of our Soudanese\r\nsoldiers facilitated matters, for they saw in them, at any rate,\r\ncountrymen. I had no difficulty in persuading several large groups of\r\ndervishes, whom I could see from my horse inside their compounds, to\r\ncome out into the lanes or roadway and lay down their rifles. By such\r\nmeans the headquarters' advance through the town was made possible and\r\nrelatively easy. The sun had set and darkness was upon us before the\r\nSirdar and staff, going at times in single file, reached the common\r\nprison where the Assouan merchant, Charles Neufeld, was confined.\r\nWhilst accompanying a convoy of rifles presented by the Egyptian\r\nGovernment in 1886 to Sheikh Saleh of the friendly Kabbabish tribe,\r\nNeufeld had been captured by a party of dervishes. Like the other\r\nEuropean prisoners who fell into their hands, he had undergone great\r\nhardships and experienced all the trials of misfortune. Neufeld and\r\nseveral hundred natives who had incurred the Khalifa's ire or distrust\r\nwere found in a pestilential enclosure less than an acre in extent,\r\nsurrounded by mud-walls. All of them wore heavy leg chains, and a\r\nfew were handcuffed besides. The principal jail deliveries were by\r\ndisease and the gallows; the latter were almost daily in use. Three\r\nrough sets of them stood together near the great wall. Limbs of trees\r\nstuck into the ground, with a cross-piece overhead, that was how the\r\ngallows were fashioned. A last victim of the Khalifa was cut down\r\nshortly after the troops entered Omdurman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEUFELD ON GUNBOAT \"SHEIK\"--CUTTING OFF HIS\r\nANKLE-IRONS.]\r\n\r\nNeufeld was found under a mat-covered lean-to built against the\r\nmud-wall. There was no other protection for the prisoners from\r\nsunshine or rain than coarse worn matting spread upon sticks and laid\r\nagainst the walls. The enclosure was without any sanitary arrangements\r\nwhatever. A well had been dug near the middle of the yard and from\r\nthere the prisoners drew all the water they used. The Sirdar conversed\r\nwith the prisoner, and a fruitless effort was made to find the jailer\r\nand have Neufeld's irons removed. Ultimately, when night had quite\r\nfallen and it was pitch dark, Neufeld was set upon an officer's horse,\r\nand the Sirdar and headquarters bringing him with them rode outside to\r\nwhere the main body of the army was bivouacking upon the desert, north\r\nof Omdurman. Later on I found means to have Neufeld's irons removed.\r\nHe had three sets of leg irons fastened round his ankles; a heavy bar\r\nweighing fourteen pounds, and two thick chains above that. The heavy\r\nrings upon the legs we could not get off without other appliances than\r\na hammer and iron wedge, so they were left to be removed next day on\r\nthe gunboat \"Sheik.\" It was found necessary on that occasion to grip\r\nthe rings in a vice and cut them with a cold chisel. We, however, so\r\nfreed his limbs that he could walk. Having written a second batch of\r\ndespatches by the light of a guttering candle and handed them to the\r\npress censor, we lay down in our clothes to try and sleep--no easy\r\nthing to do when you had to hold the bridle of your hungry horse the\r\nwhile, and other equally restless Arab steeds were, after their\r\nmanner, seeking to eat him or kick him to pieces. We were without food\r\nor water, for in the thrice altered camping grounds our servants had\r\ngot lost. In a flurry between dozing and waking we spent the night,\r\nhoping for the morrow. When it came there was daylight but no\r\nbreakfast. Indeed, it was not until the afternoon of the 3rd September\r\nthat our servants and baggage re-appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nCLOSE OF CAMPAIGN.--GORDON MEMORIAL SERVICE, KHARTOUM.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KHALIFA'S CHIEF EUNUCH (SURRENDERS IN BRITISH CAMP).]\r\n\r\nAlthough the beginning of a campaign often drags, the ending is\r\nusually abrupt. With the defeat and flight of Abdullah, Mahdism became\r\na thing of the past. True, there were several minor engagements fought\r\nlater against isolated recalcitrant bodies of dervishes who were too\r\nloyal to their old leaders. But these affairs in no way affected the\r\nresult achieved upon the battle-field of Omdurman. During the night or\r\nearly morning of the 2nd and 3rd of September, Colonel Macdonald's\r\nbrigade advanced into the city to help to keep the peace, and to\r\nsecure the surrender of all the armed bands of the enemy. Large bodies\r\nof dervishes were still moving about both within and without Omdurman.\r\nI had myself seen many hundreds of natives set out about dusk to\r\nrevisit the battle-field in search of plunder, to rescue wounded\r\nfriends, and to bury their dead kinsmen. Those who showed a peaceable\r\ndisposition were not molested, but all with arms were arrested and\r\npenned under guards in the Praying Square. Many prisoners were secured\r\non the battle-field, but relatively only a few thousands. On 3rd\r\nSeptember and following days enormous numbers surrendered, coming into\r\ntown or being sent in by the cavalry and friendlies. In fact, they\r\nbecame so numerous that it was found almost impossible to deal with\r\nthem. When dervishes of the Jaalin and other tribes that had abandoned\r\nMahdism came in they were at once told to behave themselves, and were\r\nallowed to go where they liked. The townsfolk and others who wished to\r\nbe let alone, turned their jibbehs inside out, at once a renunciation\r\nof the Khalifa and his works as well as a sanitary gain. Some there\r\nwere who, averse to over-cleanliness, simply tore the dervish patches\r\noff their dress, thus also resuming their fealty to the Khedive. The\r\nroll of prisoners, however, in spite of convenient blindness in\r\nletting all the lesser men who wished to escape do so, swelled to\r\nabout 11,000. In a house to house visitation the more important rebel\r\nsheikhs and Baggara in hiding were caught and kept under arrest with\r\ntheir followers. All the Greeks and the local chiefs whom Slatin Pasha\r\nknew to be secretly inimical to the dervish rule, were from the first\r\nsecured safe permits and absolute liberty. Among them were many of the\r\nMahdi's relatives, former rulers of tribes, and Emirs once high in\r\npower. Of wounded dervishes over 9000 were treated by the British and\r\nEgyptian Army Medical Staffs, although the doctors' hands were busy\r\nenough for two days with our own sick and wounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRESH BATCH WOUNDED AND UNWOUNDED DERVISH PRISONERS,\r\nOMDURMAN, 4TH SEPT. 1898.]\r\n\r\nWithin twenty-four hours after the Sirdar's entry Omdurman began to\r\nassume the signs of orderly government. Thousands of the prisoners as\r\nwell as the natives were set to work to clean up the place. The\r\nwounded were all carried into temporary hospitals and the dead were\r\ndecently interred in Moslem burial-places out upon the desert. Then\r\nthe thoroughfares were scrupulously scavengered by gangs of\r\nyesterday's furious foemen, blacks and Baggara. The dead things were\r\nput under ground, and the stagnant pools were drained or filled in.\r\nWithin a week it became actually possible to walk without an attack of\r\nviolent nausea in Omdurman. Visits were constantly paid to the\r\nbattle-field for the double purpose of rescuing any wounded\r\ndervishes there might be and counting the dead. The large number of\r\nthe enemy who for days survived shocking wounds, to which a European\r\nwould have instantly or speedily succumbed, was appalling. These\r\nwretched creatures had been seen crawling or dragging themselves for\r\nmiles to get to the Nile for water or into villages for succour. Food\r\nand water were sent out to them by the Sirdar's orders on the day\r\nafter the battle, when it was seen that the natives gave neither heed\r\nnor help to other than their own immediate kinsmen upon the field.\r\nEven in the town rations were distributed to the needy. The gunboats\r\ngoing up and down the river saw many sorry sights. Wounded dervishes\r\nwere lying by hundreds along the river's bank. Some, whose thirst had\r\nmaddened them, had drunk copiously, and then swooned and died, their\r\nheads and shoulders covered with water and the rest of their bodies\r\nstretched upon the strand. General Gatacre and Lieut. Wood on riding\r\nto revisit the zereba near Kerreri, met a dervish, part of one of\r\nwhose legs had been blown off by a shell. The man was hobbling along,\r\nleaning upon a broken spear handle, making for Omdurman, with his limb\r\nburned and roughly tied up. They gave him food and water and passed on\r\nmeeting others. A mile away, the mounted orderly drew the General's\r\nattention to an object upon the ground with the exclamation: \"Blest if\r\nit isn't that bloke's foot!\" which sure enough was the case. A number\r\nof officers were told off to count the enemy's dead upon the\r\nbattle-field. Sections of the ground were assigned to each. The actual\r\ncount was 10,800 dead bodies, which did not include all the slain,\r\nfor there were those who died in Omdurman, and afar upon the desert.\r\nOne of the officers wrote, \"I won't enter into details of our day's\r\nwork. It suffices to say, that a piece of cotton-wool soaked in\r\neucalyptus placed in the nostrils and an ample supply of neat brandy\r\nwere only just sufficient to keep us on our legs for the six hours\r\nthat we were at the job.\" He and two others had undertaken to make a\r\nsketch in addition to helping to count the slain. Unfortunately, the\r\nsketch was lost.\r\n\r\nAnd all might have been otherwise, for the Sirdar offered before the\r\nbattle to treat with the Khalifa. Here is the copy of the letter, as\r\ntranslated and published, bearing upon the subject.\r\n\r\n                                                  \"_30th August 1898._\r\n                                                 \"Viz., 11 Rabi Akhar,\r\n                                                          \"1316 (M.E.)\r\n\r\n    \"From the Sirdar of the Troops, Soudan,\r\n\r\n    \"To Abdulla, son of Mohamed El-Taaishi, Head of the Soudan.\r\n\r\n    \"Bear in your mind that your evil deeds throughout the Soudan,\r\n    particularly your murdering a great number of the Mohammedans\r\n    without cause or excuse, besides oppression and tyranny,\r\n    necessitated the advance of my troops for the destruction of your\r\n    throne, in order to save the country from your devilish doings and\r\n    iniquity. Inasmuch as there are many in your keeping for whose\r\n    blood you are held responsible--innocent, old, and infirm, women\r\n    and children and others--abhorring you and your government, who\r\n    are guilty of nothing; and because we have no desire that they\r\n    should suffer the least harm, we ask you to have them removed from\r\n    the Dem (literally, enclosure) to a place where the shells of guns\r\n    and bullets of rifles shall not reach them.

But if\r\n    you and your Emirs incline to surrender to prevent blood being\r\n    shed, we shall receive your envoy with due welcome, and be sure\r\n    that we shall treat you with justice and peace.\r\n\r\n                                                  \"(Sealed) KITCHENER,\r\n                                 \"Sirdar of the Troops in the Soudan.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Maxwell was appointed Commandant of Omdurman, and his brigade\r\nwas quartered in the town, detachments occupying the principal\r\nbuildings. Among the places so held were the Arsenal, the Khalifa's\r\nand his son the Sheikh Ed Din's houses, the Treasury, Tomb and Mosque\r\nenclosure. The rest of the troops were moved two miles to the north of\r\nthe town, where a camp was formed along the river bank. Omdurman was\r\ntoo abominably dirty to risk keeping a single soldier in the place\r\nother than was absolutely necessary. Not an hour was wasted. The\r\nSirdar's practice was--abundant work for each day and all plans\r\nprepared ahead for the next. The submission of sheikhs and their\r\nfollowers had to be received, the pursuit of the Khalifa pressed,\r\nwounded dervishes and prisoners provided for, as well as the thousands\r\nof poor in Omdurman helped in various ways. Then there had to be\r\narranged-for the disposal of the spoils of war, repatriation for many\r\nof Abdullah's enforced subjects, the formal re-occupation of Khartoum,\r\nand the immediate despatch back to Lower Egypt of the British troops\r\nwhose services were no longer required. All this and much more was\r\ndone, nor am I aware that anything was neglected, not even the\r\ncorrespondents, who were evidently too seldom far removed from the\r\nGeneral's thoughts. Hurrying into the town early on Saturday morning,\r\n3rd September, to attend Howard's funeral, I found that within half an\r\nhour after sunrise all the dead dervishes, with the murdered women and\r\nchildren, had been removed to the native burial-grounds outside\r\nOmdurman. In my rambles in the capital that day I visited the only two\r\npassable dwellings in the place, Abdullah's and his son Osman's. Both\r\nhouses had a pretence of tidiness and comfort, particularly the Sheikh\r\nEd Din's. There were paved courtyards, doors, windows with shutters,\r\nplastered walls, cupboards, benches, and ottomans. In each there were\r\nseveral rooms furnished in a rude style with articles of European\r\nmanufacture. Of glass-ware, crockery, and large mirrors there was an\r\nabundance. The Khalifa's favourite reception-room and a chamber in the\r\nharem were almost covered with big looking-glasses. Angry Jaalin and\r\nothers who had forced an entrance on the previous day, or else mayhap\r\nthe Lyddite bombs, had smashed the mirrors and most of the domestic\r\nware into atoms. Spears and swords had been freely used to hack the\r\nfurniture and fittings about. A wealth of printed and manuscript books\r\nand papers in Arabic characters were scattered, torn, and thrown into\r\na shed.\r\n\r\nThe kitchens, stables and outhouses were odorously barbaric in\r\nsqualor. They were in strange contrast to any of the rooms in the\r\nrabbit warren of attached dwelling-places within the Khalifa's private\r\ncompound. Around the Mahdi's tomb were great splashes of human blood.\r\nOn the previous evening I had seen many dead dervishes lying in that\r\nvicinity. In their credulous faith in Mohamed Achmed they had flocked\r\nthere for safety, only to be killed by our fire. Of 120 who were\r\npraying around the tomb when a 50-lb. Lyddite shell burst, but\r\neighteen escaped alive, and these were sorely wounded. The tomb,\r\ncarefully stuccoed over inside and out, was built of stone and\r\nwell-burned bricks. The base of the square wall from which the\r\ncone-shaped dome sprang was over six feet thick, the vaulted roof\r\ntapering to about eighteen inches at the apex. Great holes had been\r\nknocked in the north-east side, and the rubbish had tumbled in,\r\nbreaking the brass and iron grille round the catafalque. Beneath,\r\ncovered by two huge blocks of stone, lay Mohamed Achmed's remains.\r\nEarly that day violent hands were laid on the brass rails in the outer\r\nwindows and grille. The catafalque was stripped of its black and red\r\ncloth covering, and the wood-work was totally destroyed. All the\r\nyellow lettered panels, with texts from the Koran and the Mahdi's\r\nprayer-book, as well as the blue and yellow scroll work, were smashed\r\nor carried off by relic-hunters. The false prophet was so speedily\r\ndiscredited that not a dervish amongst the tens of thousands but\r\nregarded these and the subsequent proceedings with complete\r\nindifference. To destroy utterly the legend of Mohamed Achmed's\r\nmission, when the British troops had returned to Cairo the Mahdi's\r\nbody was disinterred. It had been roughly embalmed and the features\r\nwere said to be recognisable. The common people who saw the remains\r\nalmost doubted their senses, for it had been given out that the Mahdi\r\nhad merely gone off on a visit to heaven and would shortly return.\r\nThat his body was found surprised them, as they thought he had gone\r\naloft in the flesh, the object of the tomb being to mark the spot\r\nwhere he took leave of the earth and would return to it. Perhaps it\r\nmay be deplored that Mohamed Achmed's remains were broken up, part\r\nbeing cast into the Nile, whilst the head and other portions of the\r\nbody were retained for presentation, it is said, to medical colleges.\r\nThere were those who thought that the wisest course would have been to\r\nexpose the remains for all to see them who cared to, and then to hand\r\nthem over to the natives to bury in one of their cemeteries as if he\r\nhad been an ordinary man. But the Soudan is not Europe, nor are its\r\ninhabitants amenable to measures eminently satisfactory to civilised\r\nnorthern races. The tomb was subsequently levelled to the ground by an\r\nexplosion of gun-cotton and the debris was cleared away.\r\n\r\nI had a good look over the Khalifa's war arsenal. There were plenty of\r\ncannon, old and new, as well as machine guns, rifles, pistols, and\r\nfowling pieces of all kinds. Musical instruments, war-drums,\r\nelephants' tusks used as horns, coats of chain-mail old and new, and\r\nsteel helmets. Most of the latter are quite modern, being part of 600\r\nsupplied by a London firm of sword makers--Wilkinson & Co., Pall Mall,\r\nto a former Khedive's body-guard. Somehow these plate and chain\r\ncrusader-like head-pieces seem all to have drifted south. There were\r\nhundreds of dervish battle flags, including several duplicate black\r\nsilk banners such as the Khalifa carried during the action, and\r\nthousands of native spears, swords, and shields. In short, it would be\r\neasier to tell what was not in that extraordinary storehouse than what\r\nwas. Among other articles I saw were: Ivory, powder, percussion caps,\r\nold lead, copper, tin, bronze, cloth, looms, pianos, sewing machines,\r\nagricultural implements, boilers, steam-engines, ostrich feathers,\r\ngum, hippopotamus hides, iron and wooden bedsteads, drums, bugles,\r\nfield glasses--Lieutenant Charles Grenfell's, lost at El Teb in the\r\nEastern Soudan in 1883, were found there--bolts, zinc, rivets, paints,\r\nindia-rubber, leather, boots, knapsacks, water-bottles, flags, and\r\nclothes. There were three state coaches--one of them might at a pinch\r\nhave served for the Lord Mayor--and an American buggy. They needed a\r\nlittle retrimming, but there was harness and material enough to have\r\nrigged out the four vehicles in style. In short, the arsenal held the\r\njettisoned cargo of the whole aforetime Egyptian Soudan, with much\r\nbesides drawn from Abyssinia and Central Africa. Truly, the Khalifa\r\nmust have been a strange man, with a fine acquisitive instinct\r\nabnormally cultivated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEUFELD, WITH ABYSSINIAN WIFE AND CHILDREN; ALSO FELLOW\r\nPRISONER.]\r\n\r\nNeufeld, quite contrary to Slatin Pasha's way of speaking, declared to\r\nme that the Khalifa was not at all a bad sort of man, nor an\r\nexceptionally cruel Arab task-master, and certainly not a monster. The\r\nKhalifa, he said, had often come and chatted with him. Abdullah had\r\nvowed to him, that if he were able to have his own way he would make a\r\nclose friend of him, and have him always near his person. The Khalifa\r\nasserted he liked white men, admired their knowledge and ability, and\r\nwould, were he permitted, have many of them in Khartoum. As everybody\r\nknew, he befriended the Greeks, because he could do that with safety,\r\nfor the natives were not so jealous of them as of other white men. The\r\nTaaisha were, he declared, absurdly suspicious of his intercourse with\r\nNeufeld, and were always bringing him tales, to try and get him to\r\nkill all the white men without exception. His countrymen's jealous,\r\nnarrow fanaticism annoyed him, but what, he asked, could he do, for he\r\nwas very much in their power, and unable to afford to fly in their\r\nfaces? Abdullah often spoke thus, according to Neufeld, and, as the\r\nlatter also said, frequently that leader of the fanatical dervishes\r\nexhibited keen interest in acquiring information about Europe and its\r\npeople. He hoped to make peace some day with the outside world, and be\r\nallowed thereafter to rule the Soudan. All this, I submit, is rather\r\npuzzling, in view of the filthy den the Khalifa kept Neufeld shut up\r\nin, and the manner in which he loaded him with heavy leg-irons. During\r\nhis captivity, Neufeld had with him an Abyssinian girl, or rather\r\nwoman. She was taken prisoner with him. Thereafter she devotedly\r\nministered to his wants, fetched water and food, and made, under his\r\ntuition, really eatable bread. Neufeld, who said he met me in 1884-85,\r\nup the Nile, when he was attached to the army, gave me a piece of this\r\nbread, and I found it quite palatable. Yeast is easily made in the\r\nSoudan with sour dough and sugar.\r\n\r\nAs arsenals mayhap date back to the eras of Tubal Cain and Vulcan, it\r\nwas to be expected the Khalifa would also have his modern smithy. He\r\nmade his own gunpowder, shells, and bullets, and the metallic cases\r\nfor his troops' Remington rifles. The country was laid under\r\ncontribution to supply copper for that purpose, and he essayed the\r\nfilling of percussion caps with fulminate, not over successfully I\r\nhope. He had his cartridge manufactory, and a very well equipped\r\nengineer shop as well. Yea, the potentate was setting up a Zoo,\r\nwherein I saw three young lions chained to posts by neck collars, as\r\nthough those savage beasts were watch-dogs. As for the engineer shop,\r\nwith foundry and smithy attached, the Beit el Mauna, it was part of a\r\ncleverly planned square of buildings with a river frontage and a\r\nspacious yard. The designer was one El Osta Abdullah, a former\r\nemployee of General Gordon's in Khartoum Arsenal. There were several\r\nsteam engines; the principal one driving the main shafting was of 28\r\nhorse-power. The fly-wheel was 4 feet in diameter. There were five\r\nlathes, one cat-head lathe--36 inch, three drills, and other tools\r\nincluding a slotting machine, all in perfect going order. The\r\nmachinery had formed part of the dismantled Khartoum Arsenal, and had\r\nbeen removed into Omdurman to be nearer the watchful eyes of Yacoub,\r\nwho superintended the workshops, though destitute of mechanical\r\nknowledge. El Osta was the foreman and had numbers of natives, free\r\nand prisoners, under him. There were plenty of crucibles for iron as\r\nwell as brass smelting. The blasts of furnaces and smithy fires were\r\nserved from fanners driven by machinery. There were paint shops and\r\nstores, the floors of which were laid in bricks. In truth, the arsenal\r\nwas in process of extension. Two more engines for the shop were in\r\ncourse of completion. The steamers disabled or wrecked in the 1885\r\ncampaign had all been recovered and overhauled by the dervishes. They\r\nwere sagacious enough to make use of all the skilled labour to be\r\nfound amongst the Turkish and Egyptian prisoners who fell into their\r\nhands. Although the Khalifa's river steamers, recaptured by the\r\nSirdar, could steam fully as well as ever, their hulls and decks were\r\ndreadfully rotten and dilapidated, not a pound of paint nor any fresh\r\ntimber having been used upon them in all the intervening years.\r\n\r\n\"Is that mean, dirty compound, with those squalid mud-huts, facing the\r\nKhalifa's big wall, Osman Digna's house?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" said my\r\nnative informant, \"that is the house of the robber-chief, Osman\r\nDigna.\" I entered and found within only a few wretched slaves and poor\r\nHadendowas. Osman, like the Khalifa, had given us the slip, leaving\r\nbehind such of his people as he thought of no value, and hurrying away\r\nwith all his women and treasure towards the south. They had horses and\r\ncamels, and upon the best of them they decamped. Several of the\r\nnotorious Osman Digna's tribal retainers were caught. These wretched\r\nHadendowas were, I was told, glad to be permitted subsequently to\r\nreturn to their own country. Over 300 Abyssinians were amongst our\r\nprisoners. They had volunteered or been coerced into joining the\r\ndervish ranks. All of them were surprised to find themselves kindly\r\ntreated. In due course, those who cared to go--men, women and\r\nchildren--were provided with free passages back to Abyssinia. The\r\nSirdar held several receptions, whereat the principal native leaders\r\nand sheikhs attended. Amongst others delighted at the overthrow of the\r\nKhalifa were all the survivors of the old Khedivial army, who had been\r\nabandoned to their fate for years. Of these were the whilom Governor\r\nof Senaar, a native artillery officer who had been with Hicks Pasha,\r\nand Gordon Pasha's native medical attendant.\r\n\r\nDuring the week after the battle the British and Khedivial troops, by\r\nbrigades, made triumphal marches into and through Omdurman. Proceeding\r\nfrom our camp with flags flying and bands playing, they went along the\r\nmain thoroughfares to the Tomb and Mosque, returning by a circuitous\r\nroute to quarters. The ex-dervishes and other natives flocked in\r\nthousands to see the finely-equipped and well-disciplined battalions\r\nled by the Sirdar. It was an exhibition of power they quite\r\nunderstood, and one which won from them open praise at the gallant\r\nbearing of our soldiery. The immediate effect was to produce a feeling\r\nof deep respect for the authority of the new order of things.\r\n\r\nWhen it was found that the Khalifa had escaped by the south end of\r\nOmdurman, Colonel Broadwood, with his two regiments of Egyptian\r\ncavalry and the Camel Corps, started in pursuit. Gunboats also\r\nproceeded up the White Nile to head off the fugitives. Unfortunately\r\nas there had been a very general rainfall, the desert routes towards\r\nKordofan were not absolutely waterless. The cavalry soon found that\r\nthey were upon a hot trail; and men, women, and children, who had been\r\nunable to keep pace with the flying Khalifa and Osman Digna, were\r\npicked up. Some of these, no doubt, had purposely given their master\r\nthe slip. It was in that way that Abdullah's chief wife, the Sheikh Ed\r\nDin's mother, was caught and brought in by the \"friendlies.\" One poor\r\nwoman, just confined, had the babe, a male, taken away by her lord,\r\nwhilst she was left to shift for herself. Happily, her life was saved.\r\n\r\nAs I have said relatively little about the Egyptian cavalry, I will\r\nlet one of their officers tell what they did. Colonel Broadwood had\r\nunder him a magnificent body of officers, British and Egyptian.\r\nCaptain Legge of the 20th Hussars was the brigade-major. The narrative\r\nin question was given to me a few days after the victory.\r\n\r\n\"The Sirdar's orders on the morning of the battle to Colonel Broadwood\r\nwere, to take up successive positions on his (the Sirdar's) right\r\nflank, and to prevent the enemy's left from overlapping too far. The\r\nfear was that the dervishes might attack upon the north or weakest\r\nside of the zereba. After rejoining the infantry towards the end of\r\nthe assault made on Macdonald's brigade we were formed into two lines.\r\nTurning our backs to the Nile, that is, facing west, we galloped in\r\npursuit of the retreating dervishes. For four miles we rode forward\r\nwithout check. Then we wheeled to the left, towards Omdurman, and\r\nswept the country on the right front of the Sirdar over a width of\r\nfour miles. We were shot at repeatedly, and sometimes heavily, by\r\nbands of fugitives, but we never drew rein, using lance and sword upon\r\nall who showed fight. In that draw we made 1000 prisoners, breaking\r\nthe Remingtons of those who had rifles and sending our captives under\r\nescort of a squadron to the Sirdar. When close to Omdurman we came\r\nacross a large body of dervishes full of 'buck.' Four of our squadrons\r\nwent for them. They charged clean through them, wheeled, and charged\r\nback again. That took the sting out of them, though there were still\r\nindividual dervishes who would keep trying to charge us. Colonel\r\nBroadwood came up at that juncture with the supports, whereupon the\r\nenemy all bolted for the hills. At 2 p.m. we reported to headquarters,\r\nand, following the infantry, went to water our horses at the Nile. The\r\nsame afternoon we passed through part of Omdurman and went out upon\r\nthe open desert to the south-west. At 6.30 p.m. Slatin Pasha brought\r\nus orders to start immediately in pursuit of the Khalifa. We went on\r\nas best we could until 8.30 p.m., without food or water. Trying to run\r\nin towards the river to procure both, for a gunboat was to carry our\r\nsupplies, we found it was impossible to get within two miles of the\r\nNile owing to the overflow having turned the margin into boggy land.\r\nBesides, the bushy inaccessible ground was teeming with hostile\r\ndervishes. We had missed our way. Without off-saddling, we bivouacked\r\nwhere we were, forming square. At 4 a.m. we mounted and rode on,\r\ngoing until 8.30 a.m., when we got down to the river. There Slatin\r\nPasha quitted us, returning to Omdurman. We halted for an hour,\r\nwatered and fed our poor horses, and had a bite for ourselves. Then we\r\nremounted and rode fifteen miles farther south. We had reached a point\r\njust thirty-five miles south of Omdurman. Our horses had been going\r\nalmost continuously for four days previously, the forage was finished,\r\nand the animals exhausted, so we again halted. Supplies had been\r\nordered forward to that spot, but the overflow prevented us from being\r\nable to get near enough the native boats to draw upon them for stores.\r\nWe decided to bivouac there and take our chance of being able somehow\r\nto get at the boats. Next morning we were ordered back into Omdurman.\r\nSlatin Pasha had learned from fugitives and natives that the Khalifa\r\nwas still twenty-five miles ahead of us. Abdullah had with him 100\r\nTaaisha Baggara, and had procured fresh camels and horses, so was\r\n'going strong,' too good for us to catch up. The riverside country\r\npeople could not credit that we had defeated the Khalifa and taken\r\nOmdurman. On our way back we picked up six of Osman Digna's\r\nHadendowas. They said Osman was riding with the Khalifa, showing him\r\nthe tracks and bypaths, with all of which he was familiar. We heard\r\nthat neither Osman nor the Khalifa was wounded, and that Sheikh Ed Din\r\nwas likewise untouched.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been too readily accepted that the Black, although an\r\nincomparably fine infantry-man, would not make a good trooper. There\r\nare Blacks and Blacks as there are \"Browns and Browns.\" Many of the\r\nnegroid races of the Central Soudan are excellent horsemen. The dash\r\nof the Khalifa's mounted men was superb. So it came about that after\r\nOmdurman the Sirdar decided to reinforce the Egyptian cavalry with a\r\nnewly raised squadron or two composed entirely of Blacks. Ex-dervishes\r\nof suitable smartness and physique were permitted to join the new\r\nbody, the ranks of which were filled in a very short time, for\r\nhundreds eagerly volunteered. The accounts I have since heard of the\r\n1st Black Cavalry are eminently favourable. There can be no doubt\r\nabout one thing,--whatever may be said of fellaheen troopers, the\r\nBlacks will charge home.\r\n\r\nAnother matter that merits a little more detail is the action fought\r\nby Major Stuart Wortley's \"friendlies,\" and the work accomplished by\r\nthe flotilla under Commander Keppel, R.N. It was the gunboats that\r\ntransported the British infantry from their camps at Dakhala and\r\nDarmali so smartly to Wad Habeshi. Their assistance in that respect\r\nreduced the campaign from one of months to days, and lessened the\r\nrisks to the troops. Eight steamers arrived at Dakhala on one\r\noccasion, and the transport department did its duty so well that they\r\nwere loaded and despatched back up stream within twenty-four hours.\r\nRoyan Island had not only been made a depot of stores, but a\r\nsanatorium where sick officers and men were sent as a \"pick 'em up.\"\r\nAn order from the Sirdar on the 30th of August was wired to Royan, to\r\nfind 235 men and 8 officers who were well enough to man the gunboats,\r\nto be in short amateur marines. At that date there were 327 sick upon\r\nthe island. Most of them were eager to get to the front, but the\r\ndoctors would not certify that any of them were able to bear the\r\nfatigue of marching. There was therefore great rejoicing among the\r\nmore convalescent, for they had begun to despair of seeing the fight.\r\nThe hospital state showed that there were then at Royan 46 men of the\r\nWarwicks, 69 of the Lincolns, 62 of the Seaforths, 36 of the Camerons,\r\n19 of the Grenadier Guards, 42 of the Northumberland Fusiliers, 42 of\r\nthe Lancashire Fusiliers, and 21 of the Rifles. From 25 to 40 men were\r\nmarched on board each of the gunboats the same day. Captain Ferguson\r\nof the Northumberland Fusiliers became marine officer on board the\r\n\"Sultan,\" Lieutenant Allardice went to the \"Sheik,\" Lieutenant Seymour\r\nof the Grenadier Guards to the \"Melik,\" Captain Ritchie to the\r\n\"Nazir,\" Lieutenant Arbuthnot to the \"El Hafir,\" and Lieutenant\r\nJackson and other officers respectively to the \"Tamai,\" \"Fatah,\"\r\n\"Metemmeh,\" etc.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of August the \"Melik\" kept abreast of the cavalry acting\r\nas a screen. At noon of the same day the \"Sultan\" and the \"Melik\" and\r\n\"Nazir\" were sent to shell the dervish tents and tukals seen to the\r\neast of Kerreri village. The enemy were found in some force, about\r\n3500 strong. Eight or ten shrapnel were fired into their zerebaed\r\ncamp. Right in the middle of the tents the first shell burst. The\r\ndervishes struck their camp instantly, and mounted men and footmen ran\r\nto the hills, their flight quickened by the gunboats' Maxims. Their\r\nzereba was burned. South Kerreri village was found unoccupied. The\r\nsteamers proceeded a little further up stream, had a look at Tuti\r\nIsland, and on the west bank caught sight of a body of dervishes, Emir\r\nZaccharia's men, who also had a taste of shrapnel and Maxims.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of September at 5.30 a.m. the steamers \"Sultan,\" \"Melik,\"\r\n\"Sheik,\" \"Nazir,\" \"Fatah,\" \"Tamai,\" and \"Abu Klea\" went again up the\r\nriver to destroy the forts and land the 50-pounder Lyddite howitzer\r\nbattery on Tuti Island, whence it was to shell Omdurman. Major Stuart\r\nWortley and part of his force were also to be transferred to that\r\nisland to support Major Elmslie's battery and clear off any dervishes.\r\nIt was found, as I have already stated, that Tuti was unsuitable as a\r\nposition, and the Lyddite guns were landed instead upon the east or\r\nright bank of the river. The \"Sultan\" opened the attack, firing at the\r\nforts and pitching shells into Omdurman. In a short time the other\r\ngunboats came to her assistance, and the mud forts, of which there\r\nwere a dozen or more, were promptly silenced. Several of the dervish\r\ngunners' shells, however, only missed the steamers that were their\r\ntarget by a very few yards. Happily the embrasures of the forts were\r\nso badly made, that the enemy had but a small angle of fire. It was in\r\nmore than one instance impossible for the dervish guns to train except\r\nstraight to their front. The flotilla passed down behind Tuti Island,\r\ngoing by the east bank, and were brought-to below the island. There\r\nthe 37th R.A. Battery was landed, and the Lyddite shell fire was\r\ndirected against the great wall and the Mahdi's tomb, the range of the\r\nlatter being 3200 yards. Many dervishes were seen in and around\r\nOmdurman, and a number were noticed upon the right bank. Two of the\r\ngunboats remained all night to protect the Lyddite battery, using\r\ntheir electric search-lights to detect any lurking dervishes. The\r\nsteamers fired that day several hundred shells and 8000 rounds from\r\ntheir Maxims. Captain Prince Christian Victor was attached on board\r\nthe \"Sultan,\" and Prince Teck, who had a sharp attack of fever and had\r\ntemporarily to abandon his squadron in the Egyptian cavalry, saw that\r\nand the next day's battle from one of the other gunboats.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of September the \"Melik\" ran a little way up stream before\r\nsunrise and then returned. In the first stage of the battle the\r\n\"Nazir,\" \"Fatah,\" \"Sheik,\" \"El Hafir\" and another protected the south\r\nfront of the Sirdar's camp, whilst the \"Sultan,\" \"Melik\" and \"Tamai\"\r\nguarded the north end of it. There were over 100 shells were fired\r\nfrom the \"Sultan\" at 3000 to 2800 yards ranges. The \"Melik\" found the\r\nenemy's columns with their quick-firing 15 pounders at under 1500\r\nyards range on one occasion. During the second phase of the battle,\r\nthe \"Melik\" dropped again down stream, and struck Sheikh Ed Din's\r\ncolumn as the enemy advanced to attack Macdonald's brigade, treating\r\nthe dervishes to all her artillery. When Omdurman was occupied by the\r\ntroops the flotilla again rendered valuable help. After the action the\r\ngunboats were sent, part up the White, part up the Blue Nile, to carry\r\nthe good news and break up any dervish camps. The \"Sultan,\" \"Melik,\"\r\n\"Sheik,\" \"Nazir,\" and \"Fatah\" proceeded up the White Nile. Commander\r\nKeppel went 115 miles south of Omdurman. He saw but few of the enemy.\r\nThe country was much overflowed, the river was nearly 6 miles wide in\r\nseveral places, the wooded banks and bush being under water.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of September Major Stuart Wortley and his friendlies had a\r\nbrisk engagement with Emir Isa Zaccharia. Major Elmslie had begun the\r\nday's battle at 5.30 a.m. with a salvo of his six guns, throwing the\r\n50 lb. Lyddite shells into Omdurman. Wortley's friendlies, later on,\r\nadvanced in fine style, in open order, and drove about 800 Jehadieh\r\nout of a village. About 350 were killed, including their leader. The\r\nremainder bolted off towards the Blue Nile, pursued by the Jaalin and\r\nothers. At the close of the action Major Wortley, Captain Buckle,\r\nLieut. C. Wood, and two non-commissioned English officers walked down\r\ntowards the point from which Major Elmslie's battery was firing. They\r\nwere seen and charged by about twenty-five dervish horsemen. Luckily,\r\nheavy, boggy land intervened, and Lieut. Wood and Major Wortley\r\ndropped the leading horsemen, when some of the Jaalin rallied and came\r\nto their assistance. The rout of the Baggara was completed, the\r\ndervish horsemen leaving eleven dead upon the field.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, 4th September, the Press were invited by\r\nHeadquarters to go over by steamer to Khartoum. We were told that an\r\nofficial ceremony which we ought not to miss was about to take place.\r\nThere were an unusual number of correspondents. The previous\r\nrestrictions and military objections to their presence had been made\r\nridiculous by the widest throwing open of the door to all. The Sirdar\r\nand Headquarters embarked upon the \"Melik.\" We found that\r\nrepresentative detachments from all the commands in the army were\r\nbeing ferried over in boats and giassas towed by the steamers. From\r\nevery British battalion there were present eighty-one officers and\r\nmen. The 21st Lancers were represented by ten officers and twenty-four\r\nnon-commissioned officers and men. Two officers and seven men were\r\nsent by each battery of artillery, and two officers and five men from\r\nthe Maxim batteries. There were also representative sections from the\r\nKhedivial forces. As the steamers drew up alongside the stone-wall\r\nquay before the ruined Government House where General Gordon made his\r\nlast stand, the soldiers were seen to be already in position. There\r\nwas but little space between the quay wall and the buildings, for the\r\ndebris of bricks and stone from the overturned structure nearly\r\nblocked up the former open promenade facing the muddy Blue Nile. The\r\nruined walls and forts looked picturesque in their deep setting of\r\ndark-green palms, mimosa, and tall orange-trees. Compared with\r\ntreeless, brown, arid Omdurman, Khartoum wore an air of romance and\r\nloveliness that well became such historic ground. An odour of blossom\r\nand fruit was wafted from the wild and spacious Mission and Government\r\nHouse gardens, which even the dervishes had not been able to wreck\r\ntotally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTANT VIEW, KHARTOUM (FROM BLUE NILE).]\r\n\r\nTwo flagstaffs had been erected upon the top of the one-storied wall\r\nfronting the Blue Nile. The Sirdar ranged facing the building and the\r\nflagstaffs. Behind him were the Headquarters Staff, the Generals of\r\ndivision, and others. To his left, formed up at right angles, were the\r\nrepresentative detachments of the Egyptian army, the 11th Soudanese,\r\nwith their red heckles in their fezzes, in the front line. Upon the\r\nSirdar's right were the detachments of Gatacre's division, each in\r\nits regimental order of seniority. Standing a few paces in front of\r\nthe Sirdar, but facing him, upon a mound of earth and bricks, were the\r\nfour chaplains attached to the British infantry--Presbyterian, Church\r\nof England, Roman Catholic, and Wesleyan. _En passant_, though it is\r\nan army secret, in nothing was the Sirdar's power and strong will more\r\nmanifest than in securing the presence that day in amity of the four\r\nrepresentatives of religion. One of the reverend gentlemen, presumably\r\non the strength of the superior claims of his orthodoxy, refused to\r\njoin in any service in which clergymen of any other denomination bore\r\na part. The Sirdar sent a peremptory order, without a word of\r\nexplanation, for that cleric to embark forthwith and return to Cairo.\r\nInstead, he hastened to Headquarters and made his peace, and had the\r\norder withdrawn. Upon their right was a small body of Royal Engineer\r\nofficers, Gordon's own corps. A hundred natives or more had gathered\r\non the outside, wondering what was going to happen. The Sirdar himself\r\nhad been the first to land upon the quay and walk towards the\r\nbuilding, the windows of which Gordon had caused to be filled in to\r\nstop entrance of the dervish bullets from Tuti. There were plenty of\r\nmarks of the enemy's musketry fire, as well as the dents of shell and\r\nround shot. The former official entrance was within a littered\r\ncourtyard upon the opposite side of the building. It was whilst\r\ndescending the interior stairway to meet the dervishes that Gordon was\r\nhacked and slain by the fierce fanatics and his body cast into the\r\ncourtyard.\r\n\r\nTen o'clock was the official hour notified for the ceremonial, which\r\ncommenced upon a signal from the Sirdar. A British band played a few\r\nbars of \"God Save the Queen.\" Whilst all were saluting, Lieutenant\r\nStavely, R.N., and Captain J. Watson, A.D.C., standing on the west\r\nside of the wall ran up a brilliant silk Union Jack to the top of\r\ntheir flagstaff, hauling the halyard taut as the flag flapped smartly\r\nin the breeze. It had barely begun to ascend when Lieutenant Milford\r\nand Effendi Bakr, at the adjacent pole, ran up the Egyptian flag.\r\nThereupon an Egyptian band played at some length the Khedivial hymn.\r\nAt its close the Sirdar called for three cheers for \"The Queen,\" which\r\nwere given voluminously, even the natives shouting, though, perhaps,\r\nthey didn't quite know why. Three cheers for the Khedive were also\r\nheartily given. Meantime the \"Melik's\" quick-firing guns were rolling\r\nout a royal salute, and, as usual with them, making things jump aboard\r\nthe lightly built craft and smashing glass and crockery in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOISTING FLAGS, KHARTOUM.]\r\n\r\nEre the echo of cannon had died away another ceremony had begun. The\r\nBritish band played softly the \"Dead March in Saul,\" and every head\r\nwas bared in memory of Gordon. His funeral obsequies were at last\r\ntaking place upon the spot where he fell. Then the Egyptian band\r\nplayed their quaint funeral march, and the native men and women,\r\nunderstanding that, and whom it was played for, raised their\r\nprolonged, shrill, wailing cry. Count Calderai, the Italian Military\r\nAttache, who stood near the Sirdar, was deeply affected, whilst Count\r\nvon Tiedmann, the German Attache, who appeared in his magnificent\r\nwhite Cuirassier uniform on the occasion, was even more keenly\r\nimpressed, a soldier's tears coursing down his cheeks. But there!\r\nOther eyes were wet, and cheeks too, as well as his, and bronzed\r\nveterans were not ashamed of it either. Sadness and bitter memories!\r\nSo the Gordon legend, if you will, shall live as long as the English\r\nname endures. A brief pause, and in gentle voice and manner the Rev.\r\nJohn M. Sims, Presbyterian Chaplain--Gordon's faith--broke the\r\nsilence. In his brief prayer he said: \"Our help is in the name of the\r\nLord who made heaven and earth.\" Then he observed, \"Let us hear God's\r\nword as written for our instruction,\" reading from Psalm XV. the\r\nfollowing verses: \"Lord, who shall abide in Thy tabernacle? Who shall\r\ndwell in Thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh\r\nrighteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth\r\nnot with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a\r\nreproach against his neighbour. In whose eyes a vile person is\r\ncontemned; but he honoureth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth\r\nto his own hurt, and changeth not. He that putteth not out his money\r\nto usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these\r\nthings shall never be moved.\" \"And to God's great name shall be all\r\nthe praise and glory, world without end. Amen.\" When Mr Sims had\r\nconcluded, the Rev. A. W. B. Watson, Church of England Chaplain,\r\nrecited the Lord's Prayer. Following him the Rev. R. Brindle, Roman\r\nCatholic Chaplain, prayed, saying: \"O Almighty God, by whose\r\nprovidence are all things which come into the lives of men, whether of\r\nsuffering which Thou permittest, or of joy and gladness which Thou\r\ngivest, look down, we beseech Thee, with eyes of pity and compassion\r\non this land so loved by that heroic soul whose memory we honour\r\nbefore Thee this day. Give back to it days of peace. Send to it rulers\r\nanimated by his spirit of justice and righteousness. Strengthen them\r\nin the might of Thy power, that they may labour in making perfect the\r\nwork to which he devoted and for which he gave his life. And grant to\r\nus, Thy servants, that we may copy his virtues of self-sacrifice and\r\nfortitude, so that when Thou callest we may each be able to answer, 'I\r\nhave fought the good fight,'--a blessing which we humbly ask in the\r\nname of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Father Brindle had concluded, the pipers, accompanied by muffled\r\ndrums, played the Coronach as a lament. The weird Highland minstrelsy\r\nseemed quite in keeping with the place and solemn scene. Then the\r\nKhedivial band played a hymn tune, \"Thy Will be Done,\" and the sad\r\nceremony was closed to the boom of minute guns. Generals Rundle,\r\nGatacre, and Hunter then stepped forward and congratulated the Sirdar\r\nupon the successful completion of his task, and the commanding\r\nofficers and others, following their example, did the same. Sir\r\nHerbert acknowledged their greeting, and announced that the men would\r\nbe allowed to break off for half an hour or so to go over the ruins\r\nand gardens if they wished. Everybody availed himself of the\r\nopportunity. In a few minutes a throng of officers and men who had\r\nscrambled over the debris filled the roofless rooms and packed the\r\nstairway where Gordon was struck down. I was surprised to find that\r\neven the youngest, most callow soldiers knew their Khartoum and the\r\nstory of Gordon's fight and death. So deep and far had the tale\r\ntravelled. There were speculations and suggestions as to how the end\r\nexactly came about that were a revelation to me, so full of\r\ninformation and pregnant of observation were many of the men's\r\nremarks. Throng succeeded throng in the rooms and stairways, whilst\r\nothers went to explore the outhouses and the gardens. The passion\r\nflowers and the pomegranates were in bloom, but the oranges and limes\r\nwere in fruit. Leaves and buds were plucked by all of us as souvenirs.\r\nBrigade-Major Snow, who was with the Camel Corps in 1884-85 across the\r\nBayuda desert, produced a tiny bottle of champagne that was to have\r\nbeen drunk in Khartoum when we got there. He opened it, and shared the\r\ndriblet with a few of the old campaigners. By one p.m. we were all\r\nback again in Omdurman, leaving behind two companies of the 11th\r\nBattalion to hold Khartoum for the two flags, the hoisting of which,\r\nside by side, the Egyptians regarded as natural and most proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nKHARTOUM MEMORIAL COLLEGE.--THE OFFICIAL DESPATCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was decided by the Sirdar, from whom no successful appeal was\r\npossible, that, after the occupation of Khartoum, the war\r\ncorrespondents had no longer any pretext for remaining in the country.\r\nThere were no questions raised by the military to excuse their ruling.\r\nNo more was heard about the difficulties of transport, the scarcity of\r\nprovisions, and everything being required for the soldiers. Had not\r\nthe keen Greek sutlers, as usual, followed the army in shoals,\r\nmanaging somehow to convey themselves and their goods to the front? We\r\nhad not been two days encamped at Omdurman before some of these\r\ntraders arrived, and, dumping their sacks and boxes by the wayside,\r\nstarted selling forthwith. The natives, too, speedily reassured,\r\nbrought out and squatted before baskets of dates, onions, and other\r\ncomestibles they were anxious to dispose of for English or Egyptian\r\nmoney. Rightly contemning the Khalifa's coinage as practically\r\nvalueless, they refused to accept it in payment, and proffered to sell\r\nall they possessed at the price of old copper. The British troops\r\nmade their triumphal entry into Omdurman on the 5th of September, and\r\nseveral of the correspondents left for England the same day. We who\r\nremained had a sort of Hobson's choice, either to return to Cairo on\r\nthe 8th September or to remain in Omdurman out of which we should not\r\nbe allowed to stir until all the British troops had gone, when we\r\nshould have to leave with the last batch. Which course we should adopt\r\nwas with fine humour left to be decided by a majority of ourselves.\r\nFor once the Press was practically unanimous and elected to shake the\r\ndust of the Soudan from their feet, and so it came about that the war\r\ncorrespondents had to fold their tents and go, disposing of their\r\nquadrupeds as best they could. There was no alternative in the case of\r\nthe horses between accepting any price for them or shooting them, for,\r\nin the Soudan, there being no grazing, a horse must have a master or\r\nstarve. I disposed of a L40 animal for L1 and got but little more for\r\nthree others. The camels and stores fetched somewhat better prices.\r\nOur servants we took back to their homes.\r\n\r\nYet for sundry reasons I was anxious to be allowed to remain longer in\r\nthe Soudan. There was news of fighting and movement up the Blue Nile.\r\nEmir Ahmed Fadl bringing a force of 3000 dervishes from Gedarif to\r\nassist the Khalifa had been driven back by the gunboat \"Sultan.\" More\r\nimportant still, rumours had reached us that the French, under\r\nMarchand, were at Fashoda. I knew that the Sirdar intended sending a\r\nforce upon the gunboats up the White Nile to Fashoda and Sobat, so I\r\nmade both verbal and written requests to the General for permission to\r\naccompany the expedition. That, I was told, could not be granted. We\r\nhad full confirmation of the fact that Major Marchand was at Fashoda\r\nbrought down to Omdurman on the 7th September by the dervish steamer\r\n\"Tewfikieh.\" I boarded her and had a long chat with the captain (reis)\r\nand members of the crew, all of whom wore jibbehs. The little craft\r\nwas an ex-Thames, above-the-bridges, penny steamer with Penn's\r\noscillating engines. She was one of the boats Gordon sent from\r\nKhartoum in 1884 to meet the Desert Column at Metemmeh. She was, if\r\npossible, more dilapidated-looking than ever. By guarded questioning I\r\nascertained that the \"Tewfikieh\" was three days out from Fashoda. She\r\nand the \"Safieh,\" another dervish steamer, had been hotly fired upon\r\nby the French who were occupying the old Egyptian fort with 100\r\nSenegalese or natives of Timbuctoo. A number of local natives,\r\nShilluks, who had long been hostile to the dervishes, were\r\nco-operating with the strangers. The reis accurately described the\r\nFrench flag which was flying over the works and the appearance of the\r\nEuropeans. I was also able to procure several of the Lebel rifle\r\nbullets that had entered the upper structure of the steamer. The\r\ncensor struck out from my telegrams all allusion to the presence of\r\nthe French at Fashoda, and I had to wait until I returned to Lower\r\nEgypt to transmit the news to London. I openly held that the Fashoda\r\naffair should be promptly and fully disclosed to the British public,\r\nand I acted upon that conviction.\r\n\r\nThe \"Safieh\" remained up the Nile, making fast to the bank about 100\r\nmiles north of Fashoda, to await the return of the \"Tewfikieh\" with\r\norders from the Khalifa and reinforcements to destroy the French. No\r\ndoubt there was an attempt made to carry out an Anglophobe idea of\r\neffecting a friendly alliance with the Mahdists so as to secure to\r\nFrance the right of access to the Nile and the Bahr el Ghazal. It was\r\nan effort to achieve the impossible, to negotiate a treaty with wild\r\nbeasts. Had the dervishes, or even the \"Safieh's\" people who were\r\ndrumming up recruits, been granted a fortnight to do it in the\r\nMarchand expedition would have been totally destroyed. The \"Tewfikieh\"\r\narrived in a dust-storm and passed the Sirdar's gunboats unseen, and\r\nit was not until she got to Omdurman that the dervish reis and crew\r\nrealised what had happened. With quick wit the skipper acted, for\r\nthose who go upon waters are of a catholicity of creed and\r\ngood-fellowship very different from ordinary landsmen. He ran his\r\ncraft to the bank, landed with one of his crew and paid a visit to\r\nheadquarters, where he surrendered himself and his craft. Both were at\r\nonce accepted, and during the course of the same day the \"Tewfikieh\"\r\nagain hoisted the Khedivial flag and was employed in towing and ferry\r\nwork. The captain and crew stood by their ship working her, and though\r\ndressed as dervishes were on the flotilla muster-roll for wages and\r\nrations. The like befell the other dervish steamers that came into\r\nthe Sirdar's hands. For two days there was a sale of the loot\r\ncaptured by the army. Arms, drums, flags, and nearly all the smaller\r\narticles found in the arsenal were auctioned. Some L4000 or more of\r\nivory and other merchandise were put aside. On the first day big\r\nprices were paid by officers and men for trophies, but the following\r\nday spears and swords were sold for trifling sums. The money derived\r\nfrom the sale was set aside for distribution as prize money. All the\r\nbattalions, batteries, and corps had, however, free gifts of guns,\r\nflags, or other trophies for souvenirs. On the afternoon of the 8th\r\nSeptember the correspondents and their belongings proceeded on the\r\nhorribly frowsy, rat-overrun, dervish steamer \"Bordein\" to Dakhala,\r\nthe railhead. The steamer was packed upon and below deck with British\r\nsoldiers, about 50 of whom were sick, whilst several were wounded.\r\nStowed almost like cattle, sitting, squatting, lying anywhere, anyhow,\r\nwithout shade or shelter, we underwent two days of it on board. It was\r\nfound necessary to tie up occasionally for wood (fuel), and at night\r\nthe steamer was always moored to the bank. These occasions provided\r\nthe needed opportunity to prepare and partake of meals, and find space\r\nto sleep upon the shore. But it was war-time, and extra roughing-it is\r\nalways an accompaniment of the game in uncivilised countries. Within a\r\nweek, thanks to the desert railway and the post-boats, we were back\r\nenjoying the delicious flesh-pots of Egypt, first on board Messrs\r\nCook's magnificent Nile steamers, and thereafter in Shepheard's hotel,\r\nCairo.\r\n\r\nOn the way down I saw something and heard more of the excellent\r\nbase-hospital established at Abadia, of which Lieut.-Col. Clery,\r\nR.A.M.C., was in charge. Landing stages had been erected for receiving\r\nthe sick and wounded, and wells were dug from which, owing to\r\ninfiltration, clear water was drawn for use in the hospital. All\r\nwater, however, used for food or drink was in addition filtered and\r\nboiled. The percentage of recovery by patients was eminently\r\nsatisfactory. Major Battersby, R.A.M.C, had a Roentgen Ray apparatus\r\nwhich was employed in twenty-two cases to locate bullets and\r\nfractures. In connection with the treatment of the sick and wounded,\r\nit is to be regretted that earlier and greater use was not made of the\r\nNational Aid Society's offer to provide steamers properly fitted for\r\ncarrying invalids. A railway journey in Egypt or the Soudan is, at the\r\nbest, a painful experience for even those who are well. From Assouan\r\nto Cairo every invalided soldier could and should have been\r\ntransported by water, on just such a craft as the hospital,\r\n\"Mayflower,\" which the Society promptly and admirably equipped the\r\nmoment the authorities gave their consent. As early as June 1898\r\nLieut.-Col. Young, on behalf of the Red Cross Society, wrote\r\nintimating a desire to assist, entirely at their own expense, in the\r\nexpedition. This application met with a refusal, and it was not until\r\nthe 1st of August 1898 that the Foreign Office replied to a subsequent\r\nappeal that the Sirdar would gladly accept their proffer. Had the\r\nmatter been settled in June, instead of August, there could have been\r\nthree hospital ships plying, enough to transport every sick soldier\r\nby water. By the 6th of September the \"Mayflower\" was ready with a\r\ncrew and a complement of nurses. The army provided their own medical\r\nstaff, the Society running the steamer and supplying the cuisine,\r\nwhich was under the direction of a French \"chef.\" The \"Mayflower\" was\r\nable to convey, in most comfortable quarters, with every possible\r\nattention to their needs, seventy-two sick and wounded soldiers.\r\nPjamas, socks, shirts and other necessaries were given free to every\r\npatient. The steamer did good service, making at least three round\r\ntrips to bring down patients.\r\n\r\nThe wounds received in battle had scarce been dressed before the\r\nSirdar was seeking to give effect to his schemes for the well-being of\r\nthe Soudanese. Means were taken for the speedy connecting by telegraph\r\nof Suakin and Berber, Suakin, Kassala, Gedarif, Khartoum. The wire\r\nfrom Dakhala to Nasri was brought on to Omdurman a few days after the\r\nvictory. Arrangements were further made to bridge the Atbara and carry\r\nforward the Wady Halfa-Abu Hamed-Dakhala line along the east bank to a\r\npoint upon the Blue Nile opposite Khartoum. That railway will be\r\ncompleted in 1899, and there will be through train service from Wady\r\nHalfa to the junction of the two Niles. With the suitable steamers\r\nalready in hand, there should be, all the year round, water\r\ncommunication up the Blue Nile for hundreds of miles, and upon the\r\nWhite Nile, with a few porterages, to the Great Equatorial Lakes, and\r\nwest through the Bahr el Ghazal country. So much was for commerce, for\r\nmaterial benefaction, but there was besides recognition of what was\r\ndue to higher needs. I knew the Sirdar had long entertained the idea\r\nof fitly commemorating General Gordon's glorious self-abnegation in\r\nstriving to help the natives, single-handed, fighting unto death\r\nignorance and fanaticism. A scheme that would provide for the\r\neducation of the youth of the Soudan, conveying to them the stores of\r\nknowledge taught in the colleges of civilised countries, was what he\r\naimed at. The desired institution should be founded in Khartoum, which\r\nwas to become a centre of light and guidance for the new nation being\r\nborn to rule Central Africa. As the Mussulman is nothing if not\r\nfanatical whenever religious questions are introduced, it was to be a\r\nfoundation solely devoted to teaching exact knowledge without any\r\n\"ism.\"\r\n\r\nI had the opportunity afforded me of several conversations with the\r\nSirdar upon the subject so dear to him, \"a Gordon Memorial College in\r\nKhartoum.\" The substance of these interviews I cabled fully to the\r\n_Daily Telegraph_, which, with most other journals, warmly advocated\r\nthe carrying out of the scheme. It was certain that Gordon and\r\nKhartoum would remain objects of interest to our race, and that public\r\nsentiment demanded the erection of some proper memorial of the sad\r\npast. Nothing better than the founding of a People's College could be\r\nthought of. Lamentable ignorance of the world and all therein was and\r\nyet is the direct curse of the land. The natives have had no\r\nopportunity of learning anything beyond the parrot-smattering of the\r\nKoran, the one book of Moslem schools. The rudimentary knowledge\r\ncommon to British schoolboys transcends all the learning of the wise\r\nin the Soudan. The people, Arabs and blacks, are docile and capable of\r\nreadily learning everything taught in the ordinary scholastic\r\ncurriculum at home. With a minimum annual income of L1500 a year,\r\nteachers and apparatus could, it was said, be provided, although in\r\naddition five or six thousand pounds sterling would be required for\r\npreliminary outlay. The land and part of the necessary buildings, the\r\nSirdar intimated, would probably be presented as a gift by the\r\nEgyptian Government. It would be futile, as all knew, trying to\r\nsucceed with a staff of native teachers. Tribal relations and other\r\ncauses stood in the way, and unless the college was to be doomed to\r\nfailure it would have to be launched and conducted by virile European\r\nprofessors. Much if not all of the food required for the staff and\r\nscholars could be purchased cheaply or might be raised in the college\r\ngrounds by the pupils themselves. Technical training would be taught\r\nhand in hand with the ordinary courses. These were the outlines of the\r\nSirdar's communications, who, by the way, at that date was already\r\nbeing known as Lord Kitchener of Khartoum. It having been noticed that\r\ncertain dignitaries and others were, through the press, ruining the\r\nscheme by attempts to foist upon it theological and medical schools, a\r\ncomplete answer was found for their statements by a near relative of\r\nGordon Pasha. In the course of conversation he referred to what I knew\r\nto be the facts, that the British and Egyptian army doctors wherever\r\nstationed in the Soudan, or from Assouan south, were wont to give\r\nmedicines and professional services to the civil population free of\r\ncharge. General Gordon, I was authorised to state, was no\r\nnarrow-spirited Christian, for he always put the need of giving\r\neducation before attempts at proselytising. It is not generally known\r\namongst strait-laced sectarians or churchmen that Gordon Pasha, at his\r\nown expense, built a mosque for the devout Mohammedans whom he ruled,\r\nand that his name, as worthy to be remembered in Moslem annals, is\r\ninscribed upon the walls of the Mosque at Mecca. That General Gordon\r\nwas a staunch Christian goes without saying, but he was no churl who\r\ncould not esteem and respect the faith of his fellow-men. But the case\r\nis well summed up in Lord Kitchener's subsequent letter to the press.\r\n\r\nThe Sirdar wrote:--\r\n\r\n    \"SIR,--I trust that it will not be thought that I am trespassing\r\n    too much upon the goodwill of the British public, or that I am\r\n    exceeding the duties of a soldier, if I call your attention to an\r\n    issue of very grave importance arising immediately out of the\r\n    recent campaign in the Soudan. That region now lies in the pathway\r\n    of our Empire, and a numerous population has become practically\r\n    dependent upon men of our race.\r\n\r\n    \"A responsible task is henceforth laid upon us, and those who have\r\n    conquered are called upon to civilise. In fact, the work\r\n    interrupted since the death of Gordon must now be resumed.\r\n\r\n    \"It is with this conviction that I venture to lay before you a\r\n    proposal which, if it met with the approval and support of the\r\n    British public and of the English-speaking race, would prove of\r\n    inestimable benefit to the Soudan and to Africa. The area of the\r\n    Soudan comprises a population of upwards of three million persons,\r\n    of whom it may be said that they are wholly uneducated. The\r\n    dangers arising from that fact are too obvious and have been too\r\n    painfully felt during many years past for me to dwell upon them.\r\n    In the course of time, no doubt, an education of some sort, and\r\n    administered by some hands, will be set on foot. But if Khartoum\r\n    could be made forthwith the centre of an education supported by\r\n    British funds and organised from Britain, there would be secured\r\n    to this country indisputably the first place in Africa as a\r\n    civilising power, and an effect would be created which would be\r\n    felt for good throughout the central regions of that continent. I\r\n    accordingly propose that at Khartoum there should be founded and\r\n    maintained with British money a college bearing the name of the\r\n    Gordon Memorial College, to be a pledge that the memory of Gordon\r\n    is still alive among us, and that his aspirations are at length to\r\n    be realised.\r\n\r\n    \"Certain questions will naturally arise as to whom exactly we\r\n    should educate, and as to the nature of the education to be given.\r\n    Our system would need to be gradually built up. We should begin by\r\n    teaching the sons of the leading men, the heads of villages, and\r\n    the heads of districts. They belong to a race very capable of\r\n    learning and ready to learn. The teaching, in its early stages,\r\n    would be devoted to purely elementary subjects, such as reading,\r\n    writing, geography, and the English language. Later, and after\r\n    these preliminary stages had been passed, a more advanced course\r\n    would be instituted, including a training in technical subjects\r\n    specially adapted to the requirements of those who inhabit the\r\n    Valley of the Upper Nile. The principal teachers in the college\r\n    would be British and the supervision of the arrangements would be\r\n    vested in the Governor-General of the Soudan. I need not add that\r\n    there would be no interference with the religion of the people.\r\n\r\n    \"The fund required for the establishment of such a college is\r\n    L100,000. Of this, L10,000 would be appropriated to the initial\r\n    outlay, while the remaining L90,000 would be invested, and the\r\n    revenue thence derived would go to the maintenance of the college\r\n    and the support of the staff of teachers. It would be clearly\r\n    impossible at first to require payment from the pupils, but as the\r\n    college developed and the standard of its teaching rose, it would\r\n    be fair to demand fees in respect of this higher education, which\r\n    would thus support itself, and render the college independent of\r\n    any further call upon the public. It is for the provision of this\r\n    sum of L100,000 that I now desire to appeal, on behalf of a race\r\n    dependent upon our mercy, in the name of Gordon, and in the cause\r\n    of that civilisation which is the life of the Empire of Britain.\r\n\r\n    \"I am authorised to state that Her Majesty the Queen has been\r\n    graciously pleased to become the patron of the movement. His Royal\r\n    Highness the Prince of Wales has graciously consented to become\r\n    vice-patron.\r\n\r\n    \"I may state that a general council of the leading men of the\r\n    country is in course of formation.

In the Metropolis as\r\nwell as in all the chief towns of the Kingdom the matter was taken up\r\nenthusiastically. An influential committee was formed. The\r\nsubscriptions were showered in from home and abroad, wherever the\r\nEnglish tongue was spoken and Gordon had been known. In less than a\r\nmonth the L100,000, and considerably more, were subscribed, and the\r\nestablishment of the Memorial College assured.\r\n\r\nLieut.-Colonel C. S. B. Parsons, R.A., Governor of Kassala and the Red\r\nSea littoral, to whom I have previously referred when we were\r\nadvancing against Omdurman, was menacing the dervish outpost of\r\nGedarif. Later on, when Ahmed Fadl was marching to reinforce his\r\nmaster the Khalifa, Colonel Parsons was leading his Egyptians,\r\nAbyssinian irregulars, and friendlies from Kassala up the head waters\r\nor khor of the Atbara, far to the southward, and thence to a tributary\r\nof the Blue Nile where the enemy had long had a garrison. The fifteen\r\nyears' campaign against Mahdism was nigh over, but not quite\r\nconcluded, with the victory of Omdurman. On receiving the check from\r\nthe gunboats, Fadl and his dervishes retreated up the Blue Nile to\r\nwhere they had come from, their own country upon the borders of\r\nAbyssinia. News seems to have reached them of Colonel Parsons'\r\nadvance, and it became a race for Gedarif. The Egyptians had a good\r\nstart, and managed to reach and capture the place and occupy the two\r\nforts, one on either side of the river, or, what it is more\r\nfrequently, the khor, before the dervishes got back. Fadl was a man\r\nof mettle and resolutely assaulted the town and forts of which he had\r\nso long been governor. A desperate action ensued, but Fadl was beaten\r\noff with a loss of 700, it is said, in killed and wounded. The\r\ncasualties in Colonel Parsons' force were about 100. But the\r\ndervishes, though severely beaten, soon returned to attack the forts.\r\nWith increased numbers they sat down before the place and began to\r\nharass sorely the Egyptian troops, cutting their communications with\r\nKassala, whence by wire to Massowah over the Italian lines and up the\r\nRed Sea to Egypt the Sirdar was able to keep in touch with Colonel\r\nParsons. They endeavoured again, on several occasions, to storm one or\r\nother of the forts, which were about half a mile apart, but happily\r\nthey were invariably repulsed. Still they persisted in their tactics\r\nof worrying, evidently determined to recapture the place. At last\r\nmatters grew so serious that Major-General Rundle was sent with a\r\nbrigade of infantry and several batteries to deal with Ahmed Fadl's\r\ndervishes. Advancing up the Blue Nile in gunboats, the Egyptian force\r\ncleared the banks of all the many wandering armed bands of the enemy.\r\nThrough the aid of the wily Abyssinian scouts, information was sent to\r\nand received from Colonel Parsons and a plan arranged for catching\r\nFadl and his men between two attacking columns. Seventeen hundred men\r\nof the Omdurman force attacked the dervishes on one side, whilst\r\nColonel Parsons' garrison assailed them from the other. The enemy were\r\ncompletely routed and scattered in all directions. Hundreds of\r\ndervishes were slain, and ultimately many who escaped were so closely\r\npressed by friendlies and Abyssinians that they surrendered. A\r\nthousand fugitive Baggara or so vainly tried to make their way up the\r\nBlue Nile, in order to retire to their former country in Kordofan.\r\nThey were caught crossing far up stream, near Rosaires, by Colonel\r\nLewis, vigorously attacked, defeated, and finally scattered. Thus the\r\nlast dervish army in the field was destroyed, and the country\r\nreclaimed to the side of peace, order, and civilised government.\r\n\r\nThe following are the official despatches of Lieutenant-General Sir\r\nFrancis Grenfell, who commanded the British troops in Egypt, and of\r\nthe Sirdar, relating to the battle of Omdurman:--\r\n\r\n    THE OFFICIAL DESPATCHES.\r\n\r\n                            Headquarters, Cairo, _September 16, 1898_.\r\n\r\n    SIR,--1. I have the honour to forward a despatch from\r\n    Major-General Sir H. Kitchener, K.C.B., Sirdar, describing the\r\n    later phases of the Soudan Campaign, and the final action on 2nd\r\n    September.\r\n\r\n    2. The Sirdar, in this despatch, recounts in brief, simple terms\r\n    the events of the closing phase of one of the most successful\r\n    campaigns ever conducted by a British General against a savage\r\n    foe, resulting in the capture of Omdurman, the destruction of the\r\n    dervish power in the Soudan, and the reopening of the waterway to\r\n    the Equatorial Provinces.\r\n\r\n    3. The concentration of the army on the Atbara was carried out to\r\n    the hour, and the arrangements for the transport of the force to\r\n    the vicinity of the battle-field were made by the Sirdar and his\r\n    staff with consummate ability. All difficulties were foreseen and\r\n    provided for, and, from the start of the campaign to its close at\r\n    Omdurman, operations have been conducted with a precision and\r\n    completeness which have been beyond all praise; while the skill\r\n    shown in the advance was equalled by the ability with which the\r\n    army was commanded in the field.\r\n\r\n    The Sirdar's admirable disposition of the force, the accurate fire\r\n    of the artillery and Maxims, and the steady fire discipline of the\r\n    infantry, assisted by the gunboats, enabled him to destroy his\r\n    enemy at long range before the bulk of the British and Egyptian\r\n    force came under any severe rifle fire, and to this cause may be\r\n    attributed the comparatively small list of casualties. Never were\r\n    greater results achieved at such a trifling cost.\r\n\r\n    4. The heavy loss in killed and wounded in the 21st Lancers is to\r\n    be deeply regretted. But the charge itself, against an\r\n    overwhelming force of sword and spear men over difficult ground,\r\n    and under unfavourable conditions, was worthy of the best\r\n    traditions of British cavalry.\r\n\r\n    5. As regards the force employed, I can say with truth that never,\r\n    in the course of my service, have I seen a finer body of troops\r\n    than the British contingent of cavalry, artillery, engineers, and\r\n    infantry placed at the disposal of the Sirdar, as regards\r\n    physique, smartness, and soldierlike bearing. The appearance of\r\n    the men speaks well for the present recruiting department, and was\r\n    a source of pride to every Englishman who saw them.\r\n\r\n    6. While thoroughly endorsing the Sirdar's recommendations, I\r\n    desire to call attention to the good work done by Major-General\r\n    Henderson, C.B., and staff at Alexandria, who conducted the\r\n    disembarkation of the force, and by my own staff at Cairo.\r\n\r\n    On Colonel H. Cooper, Assistant Adjutant-General, and\r\n    Lieut.-Colonel L. A. Hope, Deputy-Assistant Adjutant-General, fell\r\n    the brunt of the work in the despatch of the British Division to\r\n    the front.\r\n\r\n    I also desire to acknowledge the services of Brevet-Colonel A. O.\r\n    Green, Commanding Royal Engineer; Surgeon-General H. S. Muir,\r\n    M.D., Principal Medical Officer; Lieut.-Colonel F. O. Leggett,\r\n    Army Ordnance Department; Colonel F. Treffry, Army Pay Department;\r\n    Veterinary-Captain Blenkinsop, and the junior officers of the\r\n    various departments.\r\n\r\n    Major Williams, my C.R.A., was indefatigable in organising the\r\n    mule transport for the 32nd and 37th Field Batteries.\r\n\r\n    7. I have received the greatest assistance from the Egyptian\r\n    Railway Administration in the movements of the troops both going\r\n    south and returning.\r\n\r\n    Thanks to the admirable system organised by Iskander Bey Fahmy,\r\n    the traffic manager, all the services were rapidly and punctually\r\n    carried out.\r\n\r\n    8. I am sending this despatch home by my _Aide-de-camp_,\r\n    Lieutenant H. Grenfell, 1st Life Guards, who acted as Orderly\r\n    Officer to Brigadier-General Honourable N. G. Lyttelton, C.B.,\r\n    commanding Second British Brigade in the Soudan.--I have, &c.,\r\n\r\n                                 FRANCIS GRENFELL, Lieutenant-General,\r\n                                                  Commanding in Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe despatch from Major-General Sir Herbert Kitchener, Sirdar, to\r\nLieutenant-General Sir Francis Grenfell, commanding in Egypt, was as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                                        Omdurman, _September 5, 1898_.\r\n\r\n    SIR,--It having been decided that an expeditionary force of\r\n    British and Egyptian troops should be sent against the Khalifa's\r\n    army in Omdurman, I have the honour to inform you that the\r\n    following troops were concentrated at the North End of the Sixth\r\n    Cataract, in close proximity to which an advanced supply depot had\r\n    been previously formed at Nasri Island.\r\n\r\n    BRITISH TROOPS.--21st Lancers; 32nd Field Battery, Royal\r\n    Artillery; 37th Howitzer Battery, Royal Artillery; 2 40-prs.,\r\n    Royal Artillery. Infantry Division:--1st Brigade: 1st Battalion\r\n    Warwickshire Regiment, 1st Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment, 1st\r\n    Battalion Seaforth Highlanders, 1st Battalion Cameron Highlanders,\r\n    6 Maxims, Detachment Royal Engineers. 2nd Brigade: 1st Battalion\r\n    Grenadier Guards, 1st Battalion Northumberland Fusiliers, 2nd\r\n    Battalion Lancashire Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade, 4\r\n    Maxims, Detachment Royal Engineers.\r\n\r\n    EGYPTIAN TROOPS.--9 Squadrons, Cavalry; 1 Battery, Horse\r\n    Artillery; 4 Field Batteries; 10 Maxims; 8 Companies, Camel Corps.\r\n    1st Brigade: 2nd Egyptian Battalion; 9th, 10th, and 11th\r\n    Soudanese Battalions. 2nd Brigade: 8th Egyptian Battalion; 12th,\r\n    13th, and 14th Soudanese Battalions. 3rd Brigade: 3rd, 4th, 7th,\r\n    and 15th Egyptian Battalions. 4th Brigade: 1st, 5th, 17th, and\r\n    18th Egyptian Battalions. Camel Transport.\r\n\r\n    On 24th August the troops began moving by successive divisions to\r\n    Jebel Royan, where a depot of supplies and a British communication\r\n    hospital of two hundred beds were established.\r\n\r\n    On 28th August, the army marched to Wadi el Abid, and on the\r\n    following day proceeded to Sayal, from whence I despatched a\r\n    letter to the Khalifa, warning him to remove his women and\r\n    children, as I intended to bombard Omdurman unless he surrendered.\r\n\r\n    Next day the army marched to Sururab, and on September 1 reached\r\n    the village of Egeiga, two miles south of the Kerreri hills, and\r\n    within six miles of Omdurman. Patrols of the enemy's horsemen were\r\n    frequently seen during the march falling back before our cavalry,\r\n    and their outposts being driven in beyond Egeiga, our advanced\r\n    scouts came in full view of Omdurman, from which large bodies of\r\n    the enemy were seen streaming out and marching north.\r\n\r\n    At noon, from the slopes of Jebel Surgham, I saw the entire\r\n    dervish army some three miles off advancing towards us, the\r\n    Khalifa's black flag surrounded by his Mulazimin (body-guard)\r\n    being plainly discernible. I estimated their numbers at 35,000\r\n    men, though, from subsequent investigation, this figure was\r\n    probably under-estimated, their actual strength being between\r\n    forty and fifty thousand. From information received, I gather that\r\n    it was the Khalifa's intention to have met us with this force at\r\n    Kerreri, but our rapid advance surprised him.\r\n\r\n    The troops were at once disposed around the village of Egeiga,\r\n    which formed an excellent position with a clear field of fire in\r\n    every direction, and shelter-trenches and zerebas were prepared.\r\n\r\n    At 2 p.m. our vedettes reported that the enemy had halted, and\r\n    later on it was observed that they were preparing bivouacs and\r\n    lighting fires. Information was received that the Khalifa\r\n    contemplated a night attack on our position, and preparations to\r\n    repel this were made, at the same time the Egeiga villagers were\r\n    sent out to obtain information in the direction of the enemy's\r\n    camp with the idea that we intended a night attack, and, this\r\n    coming to the Khalifa's knowledge, he decided to remain in his\r\n    position; consequently, we passed an undisturbed night in the\r\n    zereba.\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile the gunboats, under Commander Keppel, which had shelled\r\n    the dervish advanced camp near Kerreri on 31st August, proceeded\r\n    at daylight on 1st September, towing the Howitzer Battery to the\r\n    right bank, whence, in conjunction with the Irregulars under Major\r\n    Stuart Wortley, their advance south was continued. After two forts\r\n    had been destroyed and the villages gallantly cleared by the\r\n    Irregulars, the Howitzers were landed in a good position on the\r\n    right bank, from whence an effective fire was opened on Omdurman,\r\n    and, after a few rounds, the conspicuous dome over the Mahdi's\r\n    tomb was partially demolished, whilst the gunboats, steaming past\r\n    the town, also effectually bombarded the forts, which replied with\r\n    a heavy, but ill-directed fire.\r\n\r\n    At dawn on the following morning (2nd September), our mounted\r\n    patrols reported the enemy advancing to attack, and by 6.30 a.m.\r\n    the Egyptian Cavalry, which had been driven in, took up a position\r\n    with the Horse Artillery, Camel Corps, and four Maxims on the\r\n    Kerreri ridge on our right flank.\r\n\r\n    At 6.40 a.m. the shouts of the advancing dervish army became\r\n    audible, and a few minutes later their flags appeared over the\r\n    rising ground, forming a semi-circle round our left and front\r\n    faces. The guns of the 32nd Field Battery opened fire at 6.45 a.m.\r\n    at a range of two thousand eight hundred yards, and the dervishes,\r\n    continuing to advance rapidly, delivered their attack with all\r\n    their accustomed dash and intrepidity. In a short time the troops\r\n    and Maxims on the left and front were hotly engaged, whilst the\r\n    enemy's riflemen, taking up positions on the slopes of Jebel\r\n    Surgham, brought a long-range fire to bear on the zereba, causing\r\n    some casualties, and their spearmen, continually reinforced from\r\n    the rear, made attempt after attempt to reach our lines.\r\n\r\n    Shortly after 8.0 a.m. the enemy's main attack was repulsed. At\r\n    this period a large and compact body of dervishes was observed\r\n    attempting to march round our right, and advancing with great\r\n    rapidity they soon became engaged with our mounted troops on the\r\n    Kerreri ridge. One of the gunboats which had been disposed to\r\n    protect the river flanks at once proceeded down stream to afford\r\n    assistance to the somewhat hardly-pressed mounted troops, and\r\n    coming within close range of the dervishes inflicted heavy loss on\r\n    them, upwards of 450 men being killed in a comparatively\r\n    circumscribed area. The Artillery and Maxims on the left face of\r\n    the zereba also co-operated, and the enemy was forced to retire\r\n    again under cover of the hills.\r\n\r\n    All attacks on our position having failed, and the enemy having\r\n    retired out of range, I sent out the 21st Lancers to clear the\r\n    ground on our left front and head off any retreating dervishes\r\n    from the direction of Omdurman. After crossing the slopes of Jebel\r\n    Surgham they came upon a body of dervishes concealed in a\r\n    depression of the ground; these they gallantly charged, but\r\n    finding, too late to withdraw, that a much larger body of the\r\n    enemy lay hidden, the charge was pressed home through them, and,\r\n    after rallying on the other side, they rode back, driving off the\r\n    dervishes, and remaining in possession of the ground. Considerable\r\n    loss was inflicted on the enemy; but I regret to say that here\r\n    fell Lieutenant R. Grenfell (12th Lancers) and twenty men.\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile I had ordered the army to follow in echelon of brigades\r\n    from the left. At 9.30 a.m. the front brigades having reached the\r\n    sand ridge running from the west end of Jebel Surgham towards the\r\n    river, a halt was ordered to enable the rear brigades to get into\r\n    position, and I then received information that the Khalifa was\r\n    still present in force on the left slopes of Surgham; a change of\r\n    front half-right of the three leading brigades was, therefore,\r\n    ordered, and it was during this movement that Macdonald's brigade\r\n    became hotly engaged, whilst taking up position on the right of\r\n    the echelon.\r\n\r\n    Learning from General Hunter, who was with Macdonald's brigade,\r\n    that he might require support, I despatched Wauchope's brigade to\r\n    reinforce him, and ordered the remaining brigades to make a\r\n    further change half-right.\r\n\r\n    No sooner had Macdonald repelled the dervish onslaught than the\r\n    force, which had retired behind the Kerreri hills, emerged again\r\n    into the plain and rapidly advanced to attack him, necessitating a\r\n    further complete change of front of his brigade to the right. This\r\n    movement was admirably executed, and now, supported by a portion\r\n    of Wauchope's brigade on the right and by Lewis's brigade\r\n    enfilading the attack on the left, he completely crushed this\r\n    second most determined dervish charge.\r\n\r\n    Meantime Maxwell's and Lyttelton's brigades had been pushed on\r\n    over the slopes of Jebel Surgham, and driving before them the\r\n    dervish forces under the Khalifa's son, Osman Sheikh ed Din, they\r\n    established themselves in a position which cut off the retreat on\r\n    Omdurman of the bulk of the dervish army, who were soon seen\r\n    streaming in a disorganised mass towards the high hills many miles\r\n    to the west, closely pursued by the mounted troops, who cleared\r\n    the right front and flanks of all hesitating and detached parties\r\n    of the enemy.\r\n\r\n    The battle was now practically over, and Lyttelton's and Maxwell's\r\n    brigades marched down to Khor Shambat, in the direction of\r\n    Omdurman, which was reached at 12.30 p.m., and here the troops\r\n    rested and watered. The remainder of Hunter's division and\r\n    Wauchope's brigade reached the same place at 3 p.m.\r\n\r\n    At 2 p.m. I advanced with Maxwell's brigade and the 32nd Field\r\n    Battery through the suburbs of Omdurman to the great wall of the\r\n    Khalifa's enclosure, and, leaving two guns and three battalions to\r\n    guard the approaches, the 13th Soudanese Battalion and four guns\r\n    (32nd Field Battery) were pushed down by the north side of the\r\n    wall to the river, and, accompanied by three gunboats which had\r\n    been previously ordered to be ready for this movement, these\r\n    troops penetrated the breaches in the wall made by the howitzers,\r\n    marched south along the line of forts, and turning in at the main\r\n    gateway found a straight road leading to the Khalifa's house and\r\n    Mahdi's tomb; these were speedily occupied, the Khalifa having\r\n    quitted the town only a short time before our entry, after a vain\r\n    effort to collect his men for further resistance.\r\n\r\n    The gunboats continued up the river clearing the streets of\r\n    dervishes, and, having returned to the remainder of the brigade\r\n    left at the corner of the wall, these were pushed forward, and\r\n    occupied all the main portions of the town. Guards were at once\r\n    mounted over the principal buildings and Khalifa's stores, and\r\n    after visiting the prison and releasing the European prisoners,\r\n    the troops bivouacked at 7 p.m. around the town, after a long and\r\n    trying day, throughout which all ranks displayed qualities of high\r\n    courage, discipline, and endurance.\r\n\r\n    The gunboats and Egyptian Cavalry and Camel Corps at once started\r\n    in pursuit south; but owing to the exhausted condition of the\r\n    animals and the flooded state of the country, which prevented them\r\n    from communicating with the gunboat carrying their forage and\r\n    rations, they were reluctantly obliged to abandon the pursuit\r\n    after following up the flying Khalifa for 30 miles through marshy\r\n    ground. The gunboats continued south for 90 miles, but were unable\r\n    to come in touch with the Khalifa, who left the river and fled\r\n    westward towards Kordofan, followed by the armed friendly tribes\r\n    who took up the pursuit on the return of the mounted troops.\r\n\r\n    Large stores of ammunition, powder, some sixty guns of various\r\n    sorts, besides vast quantities of rifles, swords, spears, banners,\r\n    drums, and other war materials, were captured on the battle-field\r\n    and in Omdurman.\r\n\r\n    The result of this battle is the practical annihilation of the\r\n    Khalifa's army, the consequent extinction of Mahdism in the\r\n    Soudan, and the submission of the whole country formerly ruled\r\n    under Egyptian authority. This has re-opened vast territories to\r\n    the benefits of peace, civilisation, and good government.\r\n\r\n    On 4th September the British and Egyptian flags were hoisted with\r\n    due ceremony on the walls of the ruined Palace of Khartoum, close\r\n    to the spot where General Gordon fell, and this event is looked\r\n    upon by the rejoicing populations as marking the commencement of a\r\n    new era of peace and prosperity for their unfortunate country.\r\n\r\n    It would be impossible for any Commander to have been more ably\r\n    seconded than I was by the General Officers serving under me.\r\n    Major-Generals Hunter, Rundle, and Gatacre have displayed the\r\n    highest qualities as daring and skilful leaders, as well as being\r\n    endowed with administrative capabilities of a high order. It is in\r\n    the hands of such officers that the Service may rest assured their\r\n    best interests will, under all circumstances, be honourably\r\n    upheld, and while expressing to them my sincere thanks for their\r\n    cordial co-operation with me, I have every confidence in most\r\n    highly recommending the names of these General Officers for the\r\n    favourable consideration of Her Majesty's Government.\r\n\r\n    The manner in which the Brigadiers handled their respective\r\n    brigades, their thorough knowledge of their profession, and their\r\n    proved skill in the field, mark them out, one and all, as fitted\r\n    for higher rank, and I have great pleasure in submitting their\r\n    names for favourable consideration:--Brigadier-Generals N. G.\r\n    Lyttelton and A. G. Wauchope; Lieutenant-Colonels J. G. Maxwell,\r\n    H. A. Macdonald, D. F. Lewis and J. Collinson.\r\n\r\n    Macdonald's brigade was highly tested, bearing the brunt of two\r\n    severe attacks delivered at very short intervals from different\r\n    directions, and I am sure it must be a source of the greatest\r\n    satisfaction to Colonel Macdonald, as it is to myself and the\r\n    whole army, that the very great care he has for long devoted to\r\n    the training of his brigade has proved so effectual, enabling his\r\n    men to behave with the greatest steadiness under most trying\r\n    circumstances, and repelling most successfully two determined\r\n    dervish onslaughts.\r\n\r\n    I should also mention under this category the excellent services\r\n    performed by Colonel R. H. Martin, commanding 21st Lancers; by\r\n    Lieut.-Colonel Long, commanding the combined British and Egyptian\r\n    Artillery; and by Lieut.-Colonel R. G. Broadwood, commanding the\r\n    Egyptian Cavalry; as well as by Major R. J. Tudway, commanding the\r\n    Camel Corps. I consider that these various arms could not have\r\n    been more efficiently commanded than they were throughout the\r\n    recent operations. The best result was, I believe, attained, and\r\n    it is due to the skilful handling of their respective commands\r\n    that the dervish defeat was so complete.\r\n\r\n    The Medical Department was administered with ability and skill by\r\n    Surgeon-General Taylor, Principal Medical Officer, who was well\r\n    assisted by Colonel M'Namara, whilst the medical organisation of\r\n    the Egyptian Army fully maintained its previous excellent\r\n    reputation under the direction of Lieut.-Colonel Gallwey and his\r\n    staff. The general medical arrangements were all that could have\r\n    been desired, and I believe the minimum of pain and maximum of\r\n    comfort procurable on active service in this country was attained\r\n    by the unremitting energy, untiring zeal, and devotion to their\r\n    duty of the entire medical staff.\r\n\r\n    Owing to the long line of communications by rail, river, and\r\n    desert, the work of maintaining a thoroughly efficient supply and\r\n    transport system, both by land and water, was arduous in the\r\n    extreme, and that a large British and Egyptian force was brought\r\n    up to within striking distance of Khartoum, amply supplied with\r\n    all its requirements, reflects the greatest credit on the supply\r\n    and transport system. I wish to cordially thank the officers of\r\n    the Supply, Transport and Railway Departments for the satisfactory\r\n    results which have attended their labours.\r\n\r\n    I consider that the excellent ration which was always provided\r\n    kept the men strong and healthy and fit to endure all the\r\n    hardships of an arduous campaign, enabling them, at a critical\r\n    moment, to support the exceptional fatigue of continuous marching\r\n    and fighting for some fourteen hours during the height of a Soudan\r\n    summer.\r\n\r\n    The Intelligence Department were, as usual, thoroughly efficient,\r\n    and their forecasts of the intentions and actions of the enemy\r\n    were accurate. Colonel Wingate and Slatin Pacha worked\r\n    indefatigably, and, with their staff, deserve a prominent place\r\n    amongst those to whom the success of the operations is due.\r\n\r\n    The excellent service performed by the gunboats under Commander\r\n    Keppel and his subordinate officers of the Royal Navy is deserving\r\n    of special mention. These gunboats have been for a long time past\r\n    almost constantly under fire; they have made bold reconnaissances\r\n    past the enemy's forts and rifle pits, and on the 1st and 2nd\r\n    September, in conjunction with the Irregular levies under Major\r\n    Stuart Wortley, and the Howitzer Battery, they materially aided in\r\n    the capture of all the forts on both banks of the Nile, and in\r\n    making the fortifications of Omdurman untenable. In bringing to\r\n    notice the readiness of resource, daring, and ability of Commander\r\n    Keppel and his officers, I wish also to add my appreciation of the\r\n    services rendered by Engineer E. Bond, Royal Navy, and the\r\n    engineering staff, as well as of the detachments of the Royal\r\n    Marine Artillery and the gun crews, who have gained the hearty\r\n    praise of their commanders.\r\n\r\n    The Rev. R. Brindle, the Rev. J. M. Simms, the Rev. A. W. B.\r\n    Watson, and the Rev. O. S. Watkins won the esteem of all by their\r\n    untiring devotion to their sacred duties and by their unfailing\r\n    and cheerful kindness to the sick and wounded at all times.\r\n\r\n    To all my personal staff my thanks are specially due for the great\r\n    assistance they at all times rendered me.\r\n\r\n    In conclusion, I have great pleasure in expressing my\r\n    appreciation of the services rendered by the detachments of the\r\n    Royal Engineers, Army Ordnance Corps, and Telegraph and Postal\r\n    Departments.\r\n\r\nThe names of a large number of officers, non-commissioned officers,\r\nand men who had been brought to the Sirdar's notice for good service\r\nwere appended to the despatch.\r\n\r\nTwo other documents call for notice, the Queen's message and the\r\nSirdar's general order to his army after the victory.\r\n\r\n    \"From the Queen to the Sirdar, Khartoum.--I congratulate you and\r\n    all your brave troops under fire on the brilliant success which\r\n    you have achieved. I am grieved for the losses which have been\r\n    sustained, but trust the wounded are doing well.--VICTORIA.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The Sirdar congratulates all the troops upon their excellent\r\n    behaviour during the general action to-day, resulting in the total\r\n    defeat of the Khalifa's forces and worthily avenging Gordon. The\r\n    Sirdar regrets the loss that has occurred, and, while warmly\r\n    thanking the troops, wishes to place on record his admiration for\r\n    their courage, discipline, and endurance.\r\n\r\n                                           \"(Signed) H. M. L. RUNDLE.\"\r\n\r\nLong lists of honours and promotions were subsequently published in\r\nthe _Gazette_. Of these, the more prominent officers who received such\r\nrecognition of their distinguished services were as follows: The\r\nSirdar was raised to the peerage as Lord Kitchener of Khartoum. In\r\naddition thereto the dignity G.C.B. was conferred upon the Sirdar, and\r\nSir Francis Grenfell. Major-Generals W. F. Gatacre, A. Hunter, and H.\r\nM. L. Rundle were created K.C.B.'s, and the dignity of Companion of\r\nthe Bath was granted to Surgeon-General William Taylor, Colonel V.\r\nHatton, Colonel L. C. Money, Colonel T. E. Verner, Colonel W. H.\r\nM'Namara, R.A.M.C., Lieut.-Col. R. A. Hope, Lieut.-Col. Collingwood,\r\nLieut.-Col. D. F. Lewis, Lieut.-Col. J. Collinson, Lieut.-Col. W. E.\r\nG. Forbes, Lieut.-Col. M. Q. Jones, Lieut.-Col. F. R. South,\r\nLieut.-Col. R. H. Martin, Lieut.-Col. W. G. C. Wyndham, and Commander\r\nC. R. Keppel, R. N. Colonel F. R. Wingate was made a Knight Commander\r\nof the Order of St Michael and St George, and a like dignity was\r\nconferred upon Colonel R. Slatin Pasha. Distinguished Service Orders\r\nwere granted to the Rev. R. Brindle, Lieut.-Col. C. V. F. Townshend,\r\nLieut.-Col. G. A. Hughes, Lieut.-Col. C. J. Blomfield, Lieut.-Col. F.\r\nLloyd, Major E. J. M. Stuart Wortley, Major E. M. Wilson, R.A.M.C.,\r\nMajor G. Cockburn, Major Hon. C. Lambton, Major N. E. Young, Major C.\r\nE. Laurie, and Major F. J. Maxse, Captain C. C. Fleming, R.A.M.C.,\r\nLieutenant G. C. M. Hall, Lieutenant F. Hubbard. The Khedive conferred\r\nthe Medjidieh and Osmanlieh orders on a large number of officers.\r\nOthers, whose names did not appear in the order list, figured in that\r\nof army promotions. Victoria Crosses were given to Captain P. A.\r\nKenna, 21st Lancers, Lieutenant R. H. L. J. de Montmorency, 21st\r\nLancers, Private Thomas Byrne, 21st Lancers (for turning back in the\r\ncharge and rescuing Lieutenant Molyneux), Captain N. M. Smyth, 2nd\r\nDragoon Guards.\r\n\r\nLieut.-Col. H. A. Macdonald, C.B., D.S.O., was made an extra A.D.C. to\r\nthe Queen.\r\n\r\nThe Sirdar on his return to Lower Egypt met with an enthusiastic\r\nreception. Lord Cromer, Sir Francis Grenfell and all the notables in\r\nCairo met him and the troops turned out to escort him to his\r\nresidence. He was entertained in Cairo at a grand banquet. When he\r\nvisited England even a heartier and grander welcome was extended to\r\nthe victor of Omdurman and the destroyer of Mahdism. The public\r\nacclaimed him, and honours and dignities were showered upon him ere he\r\nreturned to resume his self-imposed task of reconstructing the Soudan.\r\n\r\nColonel Hector A. Macdonald alone seems as yet to have had extended to\r\nhim scant military recognition of his invaluable services. The post of\r\nA.D.C. to Her Majesty is a coveted dignity, but a mere honorary\r\noffice, carrying neither pay nor emolument. Indeed it is the other\r\nway, for the accessories required to bedeck the person will cost at\r\nleast L25. But the fact cannot be forgotten, or cried down, that\r\nColonel Macdonald saved the situation. He fought a single-handed\r\nbattle against tremendous odds and won. First he faced the Khalifa and\r\nfought him to a finish, and then faced about and served Sheikh Ed\r\nDin's unbeaten dervishes in much the same fashion. For reasons that\r\ncould be given, and which reflect no discredit upon the other\r\nbrigadier, Colonel Lewis' force was not moved promptly up to\r\nMacdonald's support. Honour lists and promotion lists still keep\r\ncropping up, and possibly the military authorities are yet\r\ndeliberating what is the right thing to do in Macdonald's case. In the\r\nScotch press, and particularly in that of the Far North, there has\r\nbeen much adverse comment on the ungenerous treatment accorded their\r\ncountryman. The Highlanders, as is their nature, write and speak\r\npassionately of the matter, and pertinently ask if the authorities\r\nwish no more Highland recruits. From the paper of his own district,\r\nthe Dingwall _North Star_, I quote the following lines:--\r\n\r\n    \"In glen and clachan, England's tardy debt\r\n    The clansmen's pride will adequately pay:\r\n    Round Nor'land hearths when lamplit nights are long,\r\n    Thy fame shall ever live in many a tale and song.\"\r\n\r\nThe battle of Omdurman was not the only occasion in which Colonel\r\nMacdonald has exhibited magnificent tactical skill combined with\r\nsoldierly dash and undaunted courage. It is not so long since the\r\nAtbara was fought, and in half a score of engagements before that he\r\nquitted himself equally well. He was deservedly promoted from the\r\nranks, and to Field-Marshal Lord Roberts is due the credit of having\r\ndiscovered and properly appreciated the gallant Highlandman. His\r\nrecord is one for any man to be proud of, for to his own hand he owes\r\nhis present distinguished position. I again quote from the _North\r\nStar_:--\r\n\r\n    \"Colonel Macdonald was born at Rootfield, in the parish of\r\n    Urquhart, in the county of Ross and Cromarty, and on the property\r\n    of Mr Mackenzie of Allangrange. He began life as a stable-boy with\r\n    Bailie Robertson, of the National Hotel, Dingwall, when tenant of\r\n    the farm of Kinkell, Conon Bridge. At the age of seventeen he went\r\n    to Inverness and became an apprentice draper with Mr William\r\n    Mackay, late of the Clan Tartan Warehouse. In this capacity he\r\n    served two years, but finding mercantile life distasteful to him,\r\n    he enlisted in the 92nd Regiment. Here his qualities procured\r\n    for him rapid promotion. He successively and successfully\r\n    discharged the duties of drill-instructor, pay-sergeant, and other\r\n    non-commissioned offices, and held the rank of colour-sergeant at\r\n    the commencement of the Afghan campaign, wherein he repeatedly so\r\n    greatly distinguished himself.\r\n\r\n    \"Macdonald's first engagement with an enemy was at Jagi Thanni. On\r\n    that occasion General Roberts, escorted by the 9th Lancers and 5th\r\n    Punjaub Cavalry, advanced from Ali Kheyl to Kushi, and, while\r\n    passing by Jagi Thanni, he was attacked by about 2000 Mangals and\r\n    Machalgah Ghilzais, who there lay in ambush. Fortunately, early\r\n    intimation of the Mangals' hostile intentions reached Fort\r\n    Karatiga, a mile or two off, and a party of 45 men of the 3rd\r\n    Sikhs, under Jemander Shere Mahomed Khan, was at once sent out to\r\n    reconnoitre, and, as firing was soon afterwards heard in the\r\n    direction the party had gone, Colour-Sergeant Macdonald promptly\r\n    turned out with 18 men of his own regiment, and overtaking the\r\n    Sikhs, he took over command of the whole, and, gallantly leading\r\n    his little force across a difficult river and up a steep hill, he\r\n    boldly attacked and dislodged the enemy from a strong position on\r\n    the crest, but not before four of the Sikhs were killed, and\r\n    Deputy-Surgeon-General Townsend, who rode near General Roberts,\r\n    severely wounded. The enemy's loss here was about 30 killed.\r\n    Macdonald's brilliant services on this occasion averted something\r\n    like a disaster. In a Divisional Order, Roberts wrote:--'The above\r\n    non-commissioned officer and a native officer, with a handful of\r\n    soldiers, drove before them a large body of Mangals, who had\r\n    assembled to stop the road, ... the great coolness, judgment, and\r\n    gallantry with which they behaved.' In his despatch, dated Cabul,\r\n    15th October, and published in the _Gazette_, General Roberts\r\n    further said:--'Meanwhile, a warm engagement had for some time\r\n    been carried on in the direction of Karatiga, and presently large\r\n    numbers of the enemy were seen retreating before a small\r\n    detachment of the 92nd Highlanders and 3rd Sikhs, which had been\r\n    sent out from Karatiga, and which was, with excellent judgment and\r\n    boldness, led up a steep spur commanding the defile. The energy\r\n    and skill with which this party was handled reflected the highest\r\n    credit on Colour-Sergeant Hector Macdonald, 92nd Highlanders, and\r\n    Jemander Shere Mahomed, 3rd Sikhs. But for their excellent\r\n    services on this occasion, it might probably have been impossible\r\n    to carry out the programme of our march.' In the same _Gazette_\r\n    was published another despatch from Sir F. Roberts, dated Cabul,\r\n    20th October, in which he says:--'Colour-Sergeant H. Macdonald, a\r\n    non-commissioned officer, whose excellent and skilful management\r\n    of a small detachment when opposed to immensely superior numbers\r\n    in the Hazardarakht defile was mentioned in my despatch of the\r\n    16th instant, here again distinguished himself.' This refers to\r\n    his conduct at Charasiab, at the close of which action our brave\r\n    countryman was sent for by Roberts, who publicly complimented and\r\n    thanked him personally for 'the ability and intelligence with\r\n    which he handled the party under his command' at the battle.\r\n    Macdonald's commission was conferred on the recommendation of\r\n    General Roberts, that distinguished officer having witnessed\r\n    repeated proofs of his valour and capacity.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1885 Colonel Macdonald joined the then reorganised Egyptian\r\nConstabulary and received rapid promotion. From these, on other\r\nchanges being made, he passed into the Khedivial army, drilling and\r\ntraining new Soudanese levies. So thorough a soldier is too valuable\r\nto be longer left in the Soudan now that peace is assured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COL. H. MACDONALD AT OMDURMAN, WITH OFFICER AND\r\nNON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER OF 1ST BRIGADE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE FASHODA AFFAIR.--A RED BRITISH LINE THROUGH AFRICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrance is following in the footsteps of Spain. A fatality dogs her\r\nschemes of empire and colonisation. In truth she has no colonies--they\r\nare but military possessions. She has set her face, alone and in\r\nconjunction with others, in America, Asia, and Africa to hoop our\r\nenterprises in with bands of iron. Failure attended her policy across\r\nthe Atlantic, in India, in Burmah, and but the other day at Fashoda.\r\nHer object in that last instance was to connect her possessions in\r\nWest and East Africa, so that the red British lines which are steadily\r\nextending from North and South Africa should never be joined. France\r\nis the largest holder of territory upon the Dark Continent, and she\r\nprobably regarded that fact as the best justification for her subtle\r\nmove, through the Marchand and Abyssinian Missions, to add still more\r\nto her dominions. She had been permitted to hoop us about at Bathurst\r\nand Sierra Leone upon the West Coast and has all but completed the\r\nsame process round Ashantee and the Niger countries, not to speak of\r\nelsewhere. Madagascar she had grabbed without a shadow of excuse, but\r\ntime and South African civilisation will make it a bigger Cuba.\r\nAlready her failures at government in that vast African island are\r\ngrievous. Less than five years ago, to use a phrase I have employed\r\nelsewhere, property and life were ridiculously safe in that country.\r\nBut then the Hovas and Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony ruled the land.\r\nOther changes predicted have come about there. The one native who\r\nshowed honesty and courage in successfully opposing them at Tamatave\r\nthe French subsequently executed. The Queen and Prime Minister were\r\nbanished. Speaking English, the chief foreign language spoken, has\r\nbeen tabooed. Natives who are heard using it, or suspected of\r\nemploying our mother tongue, are thrust into prison and kept there,\r\n_pour encourager les autres_, until they promise to discontinue\r\nspeaking it. Association of natives with English or Americans renders\r\nthem marked persons. The Protestant missions are regarded as centres\r\nof treason and enmity to French authority. Quickly, as foretold, has\r\ncome about their reward(?) for non-interference politically in the\r\nearly days of French intrigue. Had they insisted, with the British\r\nGovernment of a bygone day, in saving the island for the Malagasy,\r\nthey would have succeeded. Our commerce has also had to suffer, for\r\nthe French _instruct_ the natives that they must only buy articles of\r\nFrench manufacture. The native who purchases British or American goods\r\nsoon discovers, from the severe handling he receives through the local\r\nofficials, that he has made a serious mistake. Robbery and\r\nlawlessness are rife, and in many places neither life nor property is\r\nsafe beyond rifle-shot of the French garrisons. The facts are\r\nnotorious and are in possession of the Foreign Office in Downing\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nIt had leaked out a day or two after the battle that the Sirdar\r\nintended accompanying the expedition to Fashoda. The troops ordered to\r\nproceed up the Nile with him were paraded outside Omdurman on the\r\nmorning of the 8th of September. These were 600 men of the 11th\r\nSoudanese under Major Jackson, 600 men of the 13th Soudanese under\r\nMajor Smith Dorrian, 100 men of the Cameron Highlanders under Captain\r\nthe Hon. A. D. Murray, and Captain Peake's battery of 12 1/2-pounder\r\nMaxim-Nordenfeldt guns. At the same time the force that was to be sent\r\nacross to reoccupy and assist in rebuilding the ruined Government\r\nbuildings in Khartoum also turned out for inspection. Nothing was left\r\nto chance. Care was taken that only those fit and well should proceed\r\non the gunboats and barges to Fashoda. Provision was made that the\r\nwork of reconstruction should go on in his absence, and that Khartoum\r\nand Omdurman should be left in a proper state of defence. A great air\r\nof official mystification and secrecy prevailed respecting everything\r\nthat happened at that time. Particulars were difficult to glean of the\r\nactual condition of affairs up the Blue and White Niles. Even the\r\nplans for the removal of the military headquarters and the\r\nre-establishment of the central authority in Khartoum were sealed\r\nagainst us. As the telegraph service was in the Sirdar's hands, much\r\nof the pains bestowed to keep news from us was surely unnecessary.\r\nBut the Sirdar has a way of bestowing confidences on no one--simply\r\nissuing orders when the occasion arrives.\r\n\r\nSince my return to England a reference to the correspondence disclosed\r\nin the official despatches or Fashoda Blue-book proves the correctness\r\nof the information that reached me even at that early stage. From the\r\nsummary of the documents which appeared in the _Daily Telegraph_ of\r\n10th October, we learn that \"before the battle of Omdurman Lord\r\nSalisbury had given instructions to the Sirdar through Lord Cromer,\"\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is desirable that you should be placed in possession of the\r\n    views of Her Majesty's Government in respect to the line of action\r\n    to be followed in the event of Khartoum being occupied at an early\r\n    date by the forces now operating in the Soudan under the command\r\n    of Sir Herbert Kitchener.\r\n\r\n    \"Her Majesty's Government do not contemplate that after the\r\n    occupation of Khartoum any further military operations on a large\r\n    scale, or involving any considerable expense, will be undertaken\r\n    for the occupation of the provinces to the south. But the Sirdar\r\n    is authorised to send two flotillas, one up the White and the\r\n    other up the Blue Nile.\r\n\r\n    \"You are authorised to settle the composition of these two forces\r\n    in consultation with the Sirdar.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir Herbert Kitchener should in person command the White Nile\r\n    flotilla as far as Fashoda, and may take with him a small body of\r\n    British troops, should you concur with him in thinking such a\r\n    course desirable.\r\n\r\n    \"The officer in command of the Blue Nile flotilla is authorised to\r\n    go as far as the foot of the cataract, which is believed to\r\n    commence about Rosaires. He is not to land troops with a view to\r\n    marching beyond the point on the river navigable for steamers.\r\n    Should he, before reaching Rosaires, encounter any Abyssinian\r\n    outposts, he is to halt, report the circumstance, and wait for\r\n    further instructions.\r\n\r\n    \"In dealing with any French or Abyssinian authorities who may be\r\n    encountered, nothing should be said or done which would in any way\r\n    imply a recognition on behalf of Her Majesty's Government of a\r\n    title to possession on behalf of France or Abyssinia to any\r\n    portion of the Nile Valley.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough everybody engaged in the Fashoda expedition was repeatedly\r\nwarned not to disclose anything about it, and to forget all they had\r\nseen or heard, I was enabled very shortly after the event to wire, day\r\nby day, the whole story of the enterprise. It was General Grant, who,\r\nduring the Civil War in the United States of America, terribly vexed\r\nat the newspaper correspondents, on one occasion vowed he would send\r\nthem all away and not have a press-man in his army. \"Then, General,\"\r\nsaid the American journalist addressed, \"may I ask what are you going\r\nto do without soldiers, every man of them can speak and write?\"\r\nGeneral Grant saw the absurdity of the position and smiled, and there\r\nwas an end of the matter. It was, perhaps, a choice of one of two\r\nevils, either accepting and making the best of the situation to allow\r\nthe trained journalists to remain, or to prepare to meet a tremendous\r\ninundation of wild letter-writing from all ranks that would find its\r\nway into the public press and do incalculable harm. \"Other times,\r\nother manners,\" and those modern generals discredit themselves who\r\nfail to recognise at the close of the nineteenth century that the\r\nschoolmaster and the press must be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nThe information given me by the reis of the \"Tewfikieh\" proved\r\naccurate in almost every detail. I confess that, at the time, knowing\r\nthe Arab indifference to exactness in dates, I did not credit his\r\nassertion that Marchand had reached Fashoda six weeks before the\r\ndervishes attacked him. Floating down stream in a small steam launch,\r\naluminum row-boats, and other craft, the Frenchmen arrived off Fashoda\r\non the 10th of July. In 1892-93 the French Government had begun\r\nsending military or quasi-scientific missions from the west and east\r\nAfrican coasts to obtain treaties and pre-emption claims to territory\r\nin the interior. That the French flag should wave from sea to sea was\r\ntheir confessed desire. Their incentive was to forestall and annoy\r\nGreat Britain and render worthless the blood and treasure our country\r\nmight spend in smashing the dervishes. Major Marchand set out from the\r\nwest coast or French Congo in 1896, with a small body of Europeans and\r\nabout 500 Senegalese troops. With indomitable zeal and courage he\r\npushed east, reaching the vast basin lands of the Bahr el Ghazal after\r\nsore hardships and the loss of many of his men, chiefly from sickness.\r\nThe spirit that animated the leader and his followers may be gathered\r\nfrom the following lines which were written some time ago by a\r\nnon-commissioned officer of Senegalese Rifles to his relatives.\r\n\r\n    \"We have no rest, not even for a single day, as a moment's delay\r\n    might render all our exertions useless. All that we shall have\r\n    done will be wasted if the English or others occupy our route when\r\n    we want to pass. When you read this letter we shall either be on\r\n    the Nile or our bones will be slowly whitening in the Egyptian\r\n    brushwood under a torrid sun. I verily believe that if we are\r\n    destroyed I shall retain regret for our failure in another world.\"\r\n\r\nFashoda is 444 miles by river south of Omdurman. It is situated upon\r\nthe west bank, on a low headland which at high Nile becomes an island.\r\nBefore the Mahdist rising, Fashoda was a fortified Egyptian station\r\nwith a garrison of 1000 men, and a native population of nearly 4000.\r\nThe place was enclosed within a ditch and a sun-dried brick wall. From\r\nits position it commanded the passage of the Nile, which was less than\r\nhalf a mile in width. The dervishes allowed the place to fall into\r\nruins, only maintaining a very small garrison--less than 100 men--to\r\nraid for grain to supply Omdurman with, and to collect revenue from\r\nthe native boats. Like the rest of the Soudan, the Shilluk country, in\r\nwhich Fashoda is situated, had suffered terribly and been sadly\r\ndepopulated. The country of the Shilluk negroes used to extend for\r\nseveral hundred miles northward down the left bank of the Nile from\r\nthe Bahr el Ghazal. It was but a strip, ten miles or so in width,\r\ntheir nearest neighbours, with whom they were usually at war, being\r\nthe Baggara Arabs. Like so many other riverain tracts susceptible of\r\ncultivation, it once teemed with people, the villages along the banks\r\nappearing to be one continuous row of dwellings. Helped by the\r\nShilluks, Major Marchand had no difficulty in capturing Fashoda. The\r\nold fortification was built upon the only accessible strip of dry\r\nland, at high Nile, available for miles along the bank in that\r\nvicinity. Seen from the river, the works consisted of a rectangular\r\nmud-wall about 200 yards in length, protected by horse-shoe bastions\r\nat the corners. The Khalifa being as usual in need of supplies sent\r\nout a small foraging expedition many weeks before our arrival on the\r\nscene. Starting in the steamers \"Safieh\" and \"Tewfikieh,\" they\r\ncollected grain and cattle, shipping them down to Omdurman. Learning\r\nthat Europeans had been seen at Fashoda, part of the force proceeded\r\nthere, and engaged the French, attacking them by land and water. The\r\ndate was the 25th of August. Behaving with great steadiness, and\r\nhelped by Shilluks, after a stiff fight the dervishes were driven off,\r\nafter losing a number of men, by Marchand's little garrison. \"If they\r\nhad had cannon,\" said the dervish skipper to me, \"they fired so well\r\nthat they would have sunk our steamers.\" The dervish captains then ran\r\ntheir boats down stream to collect their followers and return to\r\nassault the position. About 100 miles north the \"Safieh\" stopped to\r\ncollect the raiders, who numbered about a thousand with four brass\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock on the morning of the 10th September, the Sirdar set\r\nout from Omdurman with his expeditionary force. The troops were\r\nembarked upon the gunboats \"Sultan,\" \"Sheik,\" \"Fatah,\" and barges\r\ntowed by these vessels. Colonel Wingate, Major Lord Edward Cecil,\r\nCaptain J. K. Watson, A.D.C., and other officers, accompanied the\r\nGeneral on the stern-wheel steamer \"Dal,\" which had for armament\r\nseveral Maxims. A Union Jack, as well as an Egyptian flag, was hoisted\r\non the boat. Abundance of ammunition and two months' provisions for\r\nthe force were carried on the steamers and tows. The steamers went\r\nalong very leisurely, going only by daylight. In the afternoon, or\r\ntowards sunset, the flotilla made fast to some suitable bank. The\r\ntroops then formed a sort of camp, and parties went out with saws and\r\naxes to cut timber for fuel for the boilers. The hard gummy mimosa and\r\nsunt, when there is not too much sap in it, burns fiercely with a glow\r\nalmost equal to ordinary coal. South of Omdurman, the river still\r\nbeing in full flood, the Nile had overspread the low banks for miles.\r\nThere were places where it resembled a lake, two to six miles wide,\r\ndotted with islands. Landing was not always easily effected, for the\r\nbanks were frequently marshy. There was plenty of good sizable wood to\r\nbe had all along the river, the only difficulty being to reach and cut\r\nit. More than once, in order to \"fill up\" the vessels for next day's\r\nsteaming, the Camerons and Soudanese soldiers laboured far into the\r\nnight, hewing and carrying timber for fuel by candle-light and the\r\nelectric beam. Nearing Fashoda the Nile in places ran through channels\r\nbut 400 yards in width. The water was deep and relatively clear, with\r\na current of but two miles or less an hour. Unfortunately, it rained\r\nheavily nearly every night, and the troops quartered upon the barges\r\ngot drenched to the skin, the water pouring, in so many shower-baths,\r\nthrough the cracked boarded coverings. It is a peculiarity of most\r\ntropical climates, that Jupiter Pluvius does most of his work between\r\nthe hours of sunset and sunrise. The natives met with as a rule were\r\ndisposed to be friendly. Those with whom the men talked would not\r\nquite credit the statement that the Khalifa had been defeated, his\r\narmy destroyed, and that he had run away. On Saturday the 17th\r\nSeptember, the gunboat \"Abu Klea\" caught up with and joined the\r\nflotilla.\r\n\r\nDuring the same night, dervish deserters, blacks, and Arabs came in.\r\nThey stated that a short way further up there was a camp of the enemy.\r\nOn Sunday morning, 18th September, when near Kaka, some 65 miles north\r\nof Fashoda, the dervish steamer \"Safieh\" was sighted, lying at the\r\neast bank close by the enemy's camp. The \"Sultan\" forged ahead and\r\nbegan shelling the enemy with all her guns, using the Maxims as well.\r\nWith great alacrity the dervishes on shore replied, if indeed they did\r\nnot fire first. A few shots also came from the \"Safieh.\" With their\r\nrifled guns from behind screens of bushes the enemy bravely stood up,\r\nmaking excellent practice at the gunboats. The \"Sultan\" had several\r\nvery narrow escapes, shells passing close over her bows and stern.\r\nWhen the other gunboats got up, what with cannon, quick-firing guns,\r\nand Maxims brought to bear upon the dervish camp, it was speedily\r\nwrecked and torn. The enemy bolted into the bush, leaving over 200\r\ndead and wounded behind, including several Baggara and the chief Emir.\r\nA few shells from the \"Sultan\" had hulled and shattered the \"Safieh,\"\r\nso the victory was complete. Detachments were landed from the gunboats\r\nand the dervishes driven still further afield. Their camp was looted\r\nand burned, and the \"Safieh\" and several nuggars temporarily repaired\r\nand sent down to Omdurman. It was found that the patch put upon the\r\n\"Safieh's\" boiler by chief-engineer Benbow in 1885 was intact. That\r\nsteamer went to rescue Sir Charles Wilson's party who were wrecked on\r\ntheir return from Khartoum. Near Shabluka she was attacked by a\r\ndervish fort and hulled. Lord Charles Beresford, who was in command,\r\nstuck to the vessel after the boiler blew up, and during the night it\r\nwas repaired. On Sunday, 18th September, the Sirdar despatched a\r\nShilluk runner to go by land with a letter to Major Marchand telling\r\nhim of the approach of the Egyptian flotilla. Next morning a reply was\r\nbrought out to the \"Dal\" when it was within sight of Fashoda by an\r\nofficer in a row-boat flying the French flag, that the garrison would\r\nreceive him as a friendly visitor. Major Marchand furthermore declared\r\nthat by treaty the territory belonged to France and he had\r\ncommunicated the fact to his Government, sending his despatches\r\nthrough Abyssinia. Precise details of what had been done were\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\nIt was 10 a.m. of the 19th September when the expedition reached\r\nFashoda and saw the French flag flying over the fort. A Senegalese\r\nsentry was walking beneath the tricolor, and a row of these black\r\nriflemen's heads peeped from the walls and trenches. All of them had\r\nevidently been turned out under arms. Apparently there were about 300\r\npeople--not more--in the fortification. Steaming close in without\r\nbeing hailed, the vessels hove to opposite the works. A row-boat\r\nmanned by Senegalese pushed from the shore and made for the \"Dal.\"\r\nFrom the stern staff drooped the French flag, and by the tiller sat\r\nMajor Marchand and an officer, M. Germain. The Major was dressed in a\r\nsuit of white ducks. Below the medium height, of spare habit, with\r\nsomething like Dundreary side whiskers, he looked elderly and worn,\r\nalmost twice his years, for he is still a young man. As he stepped\r\naboard the steamer, he was received at the side. He and his companion\r\nshook hands with the Sirdar and the other members of the headquarters\r\nstaff. A relatively brief conference ensued, at which the Sirdar\r\nstated the object of his mission and his official instructions to\r\nrecover the lost provinces for Egypt. He intended, he said, to occupy\r\nand hold them. Major Marchand intimated that he had established a\r\nprior claim for his Government, and had entered into treaties with the\r\nlocal rulers securing rights for France to the country along the Nile\r\nsouth and through the Bahr el Ghazal. He had established posts at\r\nMeshra er Rek and elsewhere in that region. Without express orders to\r\nthe contrary from his Government, he would not abandon the old\r\nEgyptian fort, nor concede an inch of the territory he had acquired.\r\nThe Sirdar said he meant to land, and although he would avoid a\r\ncollision if possible with the Major and his party, yet he would not\r\nbe dissuaded from carrying out his orders because it might be\r\nunpleasant. Would, he asked, the Major oppose him with force; his\r\nmeans were inadequate to do so with any hope of success. Major\r\nMarchand replied, \"No,\" he was not in a position to justify any\r\nattempt to contend with arms against the strong flotilla and land army\r\nthat could be brought against him by the Sirdar. Still, he would\r\nneither yield nor withdraw without the order of his Government. The\r\nSirdar stated he was not adverse to letting the two Governments\r\nsettle the matter, meantime they as soldiers could remain on amicable\r\nterms. In the course of an hour or so he would land his troops and\r\noccupy a position as near the fort as possible. Major Marchand\r\nprotested, but said that he, under the circumstances, would have to\r\naccept the situation.\r\n\r\nRefreshments are always in order on board a ship where the Royal Navy\r\nis in command. Over a friendly glass of champagne Marchand and the\r\nSirdar chatted on topics of general interest. The Major intimated that\r\nhe was rather short of ammunition and stores. He had sent his steam\r\nlaunch south to try and bring up supplies and reinforcements from his\r\nother stations. The doctor was anxious to obtain the assistance and\r\nadvice of some of the British medical staff as to the best treatment\r\nof beri-beri or sleeplessness sickness, which had appeared among them.\r\nSeveral of the mission had succumbed to that weird disease. It is not\r\nunknown in the United Kingdom, a case having recently occurred at\r\nRichmond Asylum, Dublin. After spending about half an hour on board,\r\nMajor Marchand and M. Germain, accompanied by Colonel Wingate and\r\nCommander Keppel, went ashore together in the row-boat. Landing at the\r\nfort, the party were received by the garrison with military honours.\r\nThe two British officers were shown every courtesy, and escorted over\r\nthe works, which had been considerably strengthened. A morass or small\r\nlagoon cut the fortification off in rear from the mainland. It was a\r\nposition which could not easily have been carried by assault, but was\r\nindefensible against cannon. The Senegalese Tirailleurs forming the\r\ngarrison were paraded for their inspection. There appeared to be about\r\n120 of them, all stalwart, soldierly fellows, beside whom the\r\nFrenchmen looked shrunken and diminutive. In addition to the\r\nSenegalese, or rather natives of Timbuctoo, for such they were, about\r\n150 Shilluks and nondescript natives made up the remainder of the\r\ngarrison. Including Major Marchand there were nine Europeans, or five\r\ncommissioned and four non-commissioned officers. Of four others who\r\nhad succumbed on the way, two died of beri-beri, one was killed by a\r\nfall from a tree, and a third by a crocodile. The Nile in that\r\nvicinity was found to be teeming with animal life. Not only crocodiles\r\nbut hippopotami were seen by those on board the flotilla.\r\n\r\nEventually the five steamers crept as close inshore towards the north\r\nend of the fort as the shallow overflown land admitted. Colonel\r\nWingate and Commander Keppel having returned on board, all the troops\r\nwere ordered to disembark. The steamers were made fast to the banks,\r\nand planks were placed ashore. They were of little use, for officers\r\nand men had to flounder and wade through the shallows before they\r\nreached firm ground 300 yards from the bank. Four of the guns of\r\nPeake's battery were also landed. The force having been formed up was\r\nmarched a short distance to the south. It was halted behind and\r\nexactly covering the French position from the land side, the flanks\r\noverlapping and enclosing the old line of Egyptian works. A tall\r\nflag-pole which was brought ashore was set up on a ruined bastion in\r\nline with the French tricolor and about 300 yards behind it. Then the\r\nSirdar and staff came and stood around the pole. An instant later, the\r\norder having been given, the Egyptian flag was hoisted to the top, and\r\nthe Soudanese bands played a few bars of the Khedivial anthem. Ere the\r\nmusic ceased, the Sirdar, setting the example, called for three cheers\r\nfor His Highness the Khedive. The British flag, the Union Jack, was\r\nmeanwhile flying inshore from the \"Dal.\" None of the French officers\r\nattended the ceremony, but the Senegalese and the natives watched the\r\nproceedings with great interest. In fact, as many of the soldiers of\r\nthe 11th and 13th Soudanese battalions were Shilluks, there had been\r\nnumerous greetings and interchanges of courtesy between them. The\r\nworthy old Lieutenant Ali Gaffoon, a Shilluk, who had been in his\r\nyouth a sheikh and soldier, and who had fought in Mexico for\r\nMaximilian, and since entered the Khedive's service, soon had crowds\r\nof his countrymen and countrywomen flocking to see him. Immediately\r\nafter the flag was hoisted, Major Jackson was appointed commandant of\r\nthe Fashoda district, and left with a garrison of the 11th Soudanese\r\nbattalion and four guns of Captain Peake's battery. A large quantity\r\nof stores of various kinds was landed for their use. Meanwhile E\r\nCompany of the Cameron Highlanders and the rest of the troops returned\r\non board ship. The bands and pipers again played as the troops marched\r\naway, the Highlandmen stepping off to the tune of the \"Cameron Men.\" E\r\nCompany of the Camerons numbered exactly 100 rank and file under five\r\nofficers: Captain Hon. A. Murray, Lieutenants Hoare, Cameron,\r\nAlderson, and Surgeon-Captain Luther.\r\n\r\nThe fraternisation of the Soudanese soldiers and the Shilluks became\r\nthorough. An informal reception of the natives, sheikhs, and headmen,\r\nsome of whom were attended by their wives, was held by the Sirdar\r\nashore and afterwards on board the \"Dal.\" It was observed that,\r\nalthough hundreds of natives were seen, they were only brought forward\r\nin batches of less than a dozen to be presented. Besides, a\r\nconsiderable interval always elapsed before the arrival of the\r\nsucceeding groups. Ali Gaffoon and his countrymen-comrades in the\r\nranks, with pardonable tribal pride, were adverse to bringing their\r\nrelatives and friends forward until the natives put on some clothes.\r\nFor that purpose they had borrowed or got together about a dozen Arab\r\ndresses of kinds, wherewith to cover the bodies and limbs of the\r\nunsophisticated Shilluks. The national costume for men is a state of\r\nnudity, but they occasionally sprinkle their bodies with red or grey\r\nashes. The women usually wear scant leather or thong aprons. When the\r\nSirdar ascertained the true cause of the delay, time pressing, he\r\nintimated he would waive for the nonce their putting on of ceremonial\r\nattire. \"Let them all come as they are,\" and they did. They evinced\r\nthe liveliest interest and pleasure in all they saw and heard in camp\r\nand aboard ship. The chiefs declared they had signed no treaty with\r\nthe French nor conceded any of their country. All of them asserted\r\nthat they were subjects of the Khedive, to whom they renewed their\r\nallegiance forthwith. The French mission had been short of food and\r\nthey had helped them only by giving supplies. Incidentally it may be\r\nstated that the Shilluk country is exceedingly fertile. At one time it\r\nwas the most densely populated region of the Soudan for its acreage,\r\ncontaining a population of over 2,000,000 souls, living under an\r\nancient dynasty of kings. From 1884 the Shilluks repeatedly warred\r\nwith the dervishes. In 1894 they rose again and fought for a long time\r\nbefore their Queen was slain and they were put down. On that occasion\r\nthe Mahdists behaved with more than usual ferocity, putting thousands\r\nto the sword. Strange to say, great numbers of Shilluks, like other\r\nSoudan blacks, fought against us under the Khalifa's banners. The\r\nmoment, however, they were captured, with great readiness they\r\nenlisted in the Khedivial army. Latterly so many deserters and\r\nprisoners brought by their friends offered themselves as soldiers,\r\nthat only the smartest and strongest were chosen.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon the \"Dal\" and two of the gunboats left Fashoda and\r\nsteamed away up the Nile towards Sobat. Before leaving, the Sirdar\r\nsent a formal written document to Major Marchand, protesting against\r\nany usurpation by another Power of the rights of Great Britain and\r\nEgypt to the Nile Valley. He stated that he would refuse to recognise\r\nin any way French authority in the country. There was found to be\r\nlarge quantities of grass weed and sudd in the Nile at no great\r\ndistance from Fashoda. In several places the clear channels were less\r\nthan 150 yards wide. As the steamers made southing, the river became\r\nnarrower and the obstacles to navigation more serious--floating\r\nislands of weeds and banked sudd blocking the fairway, leaving it but\r\n50 yards or less in width. It is about 62 miles from Fashoda to the\r\nSobat river, that Abyssinian tributary to the Nile. There was formerly\r\nan Egyptian station and fort on the neck of land at the junction of\r\nthe two rivers. Other stations were also held by Khedivial troops\r\nfurther up the river in the old days before the Mahdi's rebellion. It\r\nwas on the 20th September, the date as officially given, that the\r\nflotilla reached Sobat. The place was overgrown with bush, as compared\r\nwith what had formerly been the case. Only a few natives were seen\r\nupon the mainland and islands, and they were friendly disposed. The\r\nSobat, though but 150 yards or so wide, is 30 feet deep when in flood.\r\nIts yellow stream runs at two knots an hour, the current driving far\r\ninto the wider and slacker waters of the Nile, which is about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile wide at that point. The banks were\r\naccessible, and a landing of the troops was much more easily effected\r\nthan had been the case at Fashoda. As soon as the soldiers and the two\r\nremaining guns of Captain Peake's battery were got ashore, the\r\nEgyptian flag was formally hoisted and greeted. It was the Sirdar who\r\ndirected the whole proceedings. The ceremonial observance attending\r\nthe re-occupation was precisely similar to that which had taken place\r\nat Fashoda. Major Smith Dorian was placed in command of the post and\r\ndistrict. Three companies of the 13th Soudanese were left as a\r\ngarrison together with the two Maxim-Nordenfeldt guns. A gunboat was\r\nalso detailed to proceed a little way up the Sobat and the Bahr el\r\nGhazal.\r\n\r\nNext morning the vessels having been filled up with fuel, the Sirdar,\r\nwith the Camerons and the remainder of the troops not detached for\r\ngarrison duty, steamed away back towards Omdurman. No news had\r\npenetrated to that remote region about the overthrow of the dervishes\r\nand very little was known about the passing mission under Major\r\nMarchand. The same day, 21st September, Fashoda was reached, and a\r\nshort stay was made. All was quiet and the two flags were flying just\r\nas the Sirdar had left them. But the place had been transformed all\r\nthe same. A military camp had arisen that looked like a village.\r\nTukals and shelters covered the clearing behind the French lines.\r\nTrenches also had been dug and Marchand's party were completely hemmed\r\nin from the landward side as well as by water, the gunboats\r\ncontrolling the river. The Shilluks had all gone over and put\r\nthemselves under Major Jackson and the Khedivial flag. A sort of\r\nbazaar had been started and the country was already making for peace.\r\nThere was universal rejoicing at the downfall of the Khalifa. A\r\ndetermination was expressed of promptly dealing with him or Osman\r\nDigna, should either of them pass that way. The new twin-screw\r\ngunboats \"Sultan\" and \"Sheik\" had nine days' rations for troops put\r\naboard. They were then detached, being ordered to remain behind for\r\npatrol duty. Their instructions were to keep the river and banks clear\r\nof all armed bands of dervishes, and, if necessary, afford assistance\r\nto the posts at Sobat and Fashoda. They were also bidden to prevent\r\nthe transport of war material, or conveyance of reinforcements, except\r\nby accredited Khedivial officers. The Sirdar in a note informed Major\r\nMarchand that he had prohibited the transport of all war material upon\r\nthe Nile. Thereafter the Sirdar resumed the journey downstream. The\r\nlong and fertile island of Abba--it extends for 20 miles--was passed\r\nwithout seeing anything of the fugitive Khalifa and his followers. It\r\nwas to Abba island the Mahdi went, and it was there the rebellion\r\nfirst broke out. Subsequently it was ascertained that Abdullah and\r\nOsman Digna with their retainers sought shelter in the heavy woods\r\nopposite Abba island, and they were stated to be in hiding there at\r\nthe end of December 1898. The Sirdar and headquarters got back to\r\nOmdurman on the 25th of September.\r\n\r\nPopular feeling ran very high at home when it was ascertained that,\r\ndespite repeated notification, the French had tried to grasp the\r\nfruits of the British victory over the dervishes. A Liberal statesman\r\nhad, years before, declared, that any attempt on the part of France to\r\noccupy the Upper Nile valley lands would be regarded as an unfriendly\r\nact by this country. Conservative statesmen had endorsed that official\r\npronouncement; yet, in face of these declarations, the thing had been\r\ndone with every evidence of a fine contempt for British feeling and\r\nself-respect. The enemies of England in Egypt and elsewhere were\r\nsniggering. Our diplomatic and military chiefs were making unusual\r\nefforts to keep the Marchand affair a profound secret. At every stage\r\ndown the Nile from Omdurman to Cairo, the Camerons and all who had\r\nbeen to Fashoda and Sobat were officially warned to keep the matter a\r\nprofound secret. The case I thought was too serious to be left hidden\r\nin the breasts of a few where the issues involved were so tremendous.\r\nSo I openly set myself to learning what had happened, and wiring every\r\nscrap of information for publication. Several officers were sent down\r\nfrom Omdurman with special despatches. Long before they arrived even\r\nin Cairo, cypher messages extending to many folios had been forwarded\r\nday after day direct from Khartoum to Downing Street.\r\n\r\nThe Sirdar reached Cairo on the 6th of October and left for England on\r\nthe 21st of the same month. By that time much had happened. The\r\nofficial despatches had been published in a Parliamentary paper and\r\nthere were ominous preparations for war in both France and Great\r\nBritain. Fleets were being got ready for sea and feverish activity\r\nprevailed in Gallic and British arsenals. The insistence of the\r\nParisian Ministers in seeking to have other questions discussed side\r\nby side with the demand for the evacuation of Fashoda and their\r\ndilatory tactics but increased the feeling of irritation in the United\r\nKingdom. Statesmen seemed to be undecided and diplomacy, as usual,\r\nrevolving in a circle. Happily, this country was never better prepared\r\nfor war, and that in the end, as has so often been the case, proved\r\nthe best advocate for peace. It would be uncharitable to emphasise the\r\nfact of the French Government slipping away from one after another of\r\nthe positions they had taken up in reference to the whole question.\r\nThat being Frenchmen they felt acutely the false moves they had made\r\ngoes without saying. Whilst war was impending and the French\r\nGovernment seemed bent upon driving our Government to that point, the\r\nanti-British Pashas and the Gallic set in Egypt were jubilant. The\r\nTurkish Pashas and Beys were openly chuckling and romancing about\r\nunheard-of things. It is in Egypt, as it is in Armenia and was in the\r\nBalkans: the Turk is the enemy of good government and freedom for the\r\npeople. A check to British policy and rule meant to them a possible\r\nreturn of the old corrupt days when they did as they liked, treating\r\nfellaheen and negroes as slaves. Had Great Britain in this instance\r\nyielded a jot of her just rights to the intriguing and bellicose\r\nspirit of French officialism Egypt would have been made an impossible\r\nplace for our countrymen to remain in. Being in Cairo and Alexandria\r\nat the time I was privately assured by scores of my countrymen, men in\r\nbusiness and in public offices, that they would be obliged to quit\r\nEgypt if France succeeded in her pretensions to the Nile Valley. Petty\r\nannoyances, tyranny, all manner of injustice and even violence would\r\nbe resorted to, to force them to leave and to drive British interests\r\nto the wall.\r\n\r\nI avail myself again of the excellent synopsis of the official\r\ndespatches dealing with the Fashoda incident, which appeared in the\r\n_Daily Telegraph_. The Parliamentary papers in question were issued on\r\nthe 9th of October last. The official papers opened with a despatch\r\nfrom Sir Edmund Monson to the Foreign Secretary, bearing date December\r\n10, 1897. Therein the British Ambassador says:--\r\n\r\n    \"The despatches which I have recently addressed to your lordship\r\n    respecting the reports of the massacre of the Marchand Expedition,\r\n    and the comments made in connection with this rumoured disaster by\r\n    the French Press, will have already shown your lordship how\r\n    necessary it has become to remind the French Government of the\r\n    views held by that of Her Majesty as to their sphere of influence\r\n    in the Upper Nile Valley; and it has been with great satisfaction\r\n    that I have found myself so promptly authorised to make a\r\n    communication upon the subject to M. Hanotaux. Made in the way in\r\n    which it has been suggested by your lordship, I see no reason why\r\n    this communication should prejudice the chances of our coming to a\r\n    satisfactory arrangement upon the question with which we are\r\n    dealing in connection with the situation in West Africa.\"\r\n\r\nSir Edmund Monson enclosed in the despatch a copy of a note he had\r\naddressed to M. Hanotaux, at that period French Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs, as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"The other point to which it is necessary to advert is the\r\n    proposed recognition of the French claim to the northern and\r\n    eastern shores of Lake Chad. If other questions are adjusted, Her\r\n    Majesty's Government will make no difficulty about this condition.\r\n    But in doing so they cannot forget that the possession of this\r\n    territory may in the future open up a road to the Nile; and they\r\n    must not be understood to admit that any other European Power than\r\n    Great Britain has any claim to occupy any part of the Valley of\r\n    the Nile. The views of the British Government upon this matter\r\n    were plainly stated in Parliament by Sir Edward Grey some years\r\n    ago during the Administration of the Earl of Rosebery, and were\r\n    formally communicated to the French Government at the time. Her\r\n    Majesty's present Government entirely adhere to the language that\r\n    was on this occasion employed by their predecessors.\"\r\n\r\nTo this M. Hanotaux replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"In any case the French Government cannot, under present\r\n    circumstances, refrain from repeating the reservations which it\r\n    has never failed to express every time that questions relating to\r\n    the Valley of the Nile have been brought forward. Thus, in\r\n    particular, the declarations of Sir Edward Grey, to which the\r\n    British Government has referred, gave rise to an immediate protest\r\n    by our representative in London, the terms of which he repeated\r\n    and developed in the further conversations which he had at the\r\n    Foreign Office on the subject. I myself had occasion, in the\r\n    sitting of the Senate on April 5, 1895, to make, in the name of\r\n    the Government, declarations to which I consider that I am all the\r\n    more justified in referring from the fact that they have called\r\n    forth no reply from the British Government.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech to which M. Hanotaux refers is published at length in an\r\nappendix, and, so far from being a reply to Sir Edward Grey, it gives\r\nthe French position completely away.\r\n\r\n    \"I now come, gentlemen,\" he said, \"to the question of the Upper\r\n    Nile. I will explain the situation to the Senate in a few words;\r\n    for I think it will be useful to complete the explanations which\r\n    M. de Lamarzelle has already given on this subject. Between the\r\n    country of the lakes and the point of Wady Halfa, on the Nile,\r\n    extends a vast region, measuring twenty degrees of latitude, or\r\n    2000 kilometres, that is, more than the breadth of Western Europe\r\n    from Gibraltar to Dunkirk. In this region there is at this moment,\r\n    perhaps, not a single European; in any case, there does not exist\r\n    any power derived, by any title, from a European authority. It is\r\n    the country of the Mahdi! Now, gentlemen, it is the future of this\r\n    country which fills with an uneasiness, which we may describe as\r\n    at least premature, the minds of a certain number of persons\r\n    interested in Africa. The Egyptians who occupied this vast domain\r\n    for a considerable time have moved to the north. Emin Pasha\r\n    himself was compelled to withdraw. The rights of the Sultan and\r\n    the Khedive alone continue to exist over the regions of the Soudan\r\n    and of Equatorial Africa.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, after the Mahdi, who was the _de facto_ ruler, the\r\nauthority over the whole basin of the Upper Nile reverted to the\r\nKhedive and the Sultan as his suzerain, which is exactly the position\r\ntaken up by Lord Salisbury in his despatch of September 9, 1898.\r\n\r\nMajor Marchand has had various titles conferred upon him, and in the\r\npenultimate despatch contained in the papers he is described by Lord\r\nSalisbury as \"a French explorer who is on the Upper Nile in a\r\ndifficult position.\" To M. Delcasse, however, is reserved the honour\r\nof giving him an official designation. On September 7 the French\r\nForeign Minister, in an interview with Sir E. Monson, after handsomely\r\ncomplimenting the British Government on the victory of Omdurman,\r\nexpressed his anxiety about a possible meeting of the Sirdar and M.\r\nMarchand.\r\n\r\n    \"Should he (M. Marchand) be met with, his Excellency said that he\r\n    had received instructions to be most careful to abstain from all\r\n    action which might cause local difficulties, and that he had been\r\n    enjoined to consider himself as an 'emissary of civilisation'\r\n    without any authority whatever to decide upon questions of right,\r\n    which must properly form the subject of discussion between Her\r\n    Majesty's Government and that of the French Republic.\r\n\r\n    \"M. Delcasse therefore begged me to inform your lordship of this\r\n    fact, and expressed the hope that the commander of Her Majesty's\r\n    naval forces on the river might be instructed to take no steps\r\n    which might lead to a local conflict with regard to such questions\r\n    of right.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked, in passing, that this view of the position of the\r\nemissary of civilisation does not tally with that which M. Marchand\r\nsubsequently gave to the Sirdar, to whom he stated \"that he had\r\nreceived precise orders for the occupation of the country and the\r\nhoisting of the French flag over the Government buildings at Fashoda,\r\nand added that, without the orders of his Government, which, however,\r\nhe expected, would not be delayed, it was impossible for him to retire\r\nfrom the place.\"\r\n\r\nThe instructions given by Lord Salisbury, through Lord Cromer, to the\r\nSirdar, have been given elsewhere in this chapter.\r\n\r\nOn September 11 our Ambassador informed M. Delcasse of the advance of\r\nthe Sirdar up the Nile, and on the 18th the French Foreign Minister\r\nstated further:--\r\n\r\n    \"As a matter of fact, there is no Marchand Mission. In 1892 and\r\n    1893 M. Liotard was sent to the Upper Ubanghi as Commissioner,\r\n    with instructions to secure French interests in the north-east. M.\r\n    Marchand had been appointed one of his subordinates, and received\r\n    all his orders from M. Liotard. There could be no doubt that for a\r\n    long time past the whole region of the Bahr-el-Ghazal had been out\r\n    of the influence of Egypt.\"\r\n\r\nSir E. Monson left M. Delcasse in no doubt as to the view Her\r\nMajesty's Government took of the situation. Of the interview referred\r\nto, he reports to Lord Salisbury as follows, under date September\r\n22:--\r\n\r\n    \"Although his Excellency made two or three allusions to the\r\n    reasons for which, in his opinion, the French might consider that\r\n    the region in question was open to their advance, he himself\r\n    volunteered the suggestion that discussion between us would be\r\n    inopportune.\r\n\r\n    \"In this I, of course, concurred, reminding him of the terms of\r\n    your lordship's telegram of the 9th inst.; but I told him, as\r\n    emphatically as I could, that I looked upon the situation at\r\n    Fashoda, if M. Marchand had occupied that town, as very serious,\r\n    inasmuch as Her Majesty's Government would certainly not acquiesce\r\n    in his remaining there, nor would they consent to relinquishing\r\n    the claims of Egypt to the restoration of all the country latterly\r\n    subject to the Khalifa, which had heretofore been a portion of\r\n    her territory. I felt it to be my duty, I said, to speak with\r\n    extreme frankness, and to assure him that on this point no\r\n    compromise would be possible.\r\n\r\n    \"M. Delcasse listened to me with grave attention, but his reply\r\n    was chiefly to the effect that if the two Governments discussed\r\n    the matter with calmness and a sincere desire to avoid a conflict,\r\n    there could be no doubt of our arriving at a peaceable and\r\n    satisfactory solution. France does not desire a quarrel. In saying\r\n    this he could speak with absolute certainty. All his colleagues in\r\n    the Government are, like himself, anxious for good relations with\r\n    England. If this anxiety is reciprocated on the other side of the\r\n    Channel (and the tone of the English Press inspires him with\r\n    doubts of this) there can be no danger.\r\n\r\n    \"I replied that Her Majesty's Government have no desire to pick a\r\n    quarrel with France, but that nothing could be gained by my\r\n    concealing from him the gravity of the situation as I regarded it,\r\n    or the fixed determination of Her Majesty's Government to\r\n    vindicate claims of the absolute justice of which they hold that\r\n    there can be no question. I, of course, avoided the use of any\r\n    expression which might sound like a menace, but short of this I\r\n    did my best to make my declaration of the impossibility of the\r\n    French being allowed to remain at Fashoda as clear and distinct as\r\n    could be expressed in words.\"\r\n\r\nOn 25th September, the day the expedition returned from Fashoda to\r\nOmdurman, Mr Rennell Rodd, who during the absence of Lord Cromer in\r\nEurope was in charge of affairs in Egypt, telegraphed to Lord\r\nSalisbury the following despatch, which had been received from the\r\nSirdar:--\r\n\r\n    \"I found at Fashoda, whence I have just returned, M. Marchand with\r\n    8 officers and 120 men. The French flag had been hoisted over the\r\n    old Government buildings in which they were located. I sent a\r\n    letter announcing my approach on the day before my arrival at\r\n    Fashoda. On the following morning, September 19, a reply was\r\n    brought to me from M. Marchand by a small rowing-boat carrying the\r\n    French flag. It stated that he had arrived at Fashoda on July 10,\r\n    having been instructed by his Government to occupy the\r\n    Bahr-el-Ghazal up to the confluence of the Bahr-el-Jebel, and also\r\n    the Shilluk country on the left bank of the White Nile as far as\r\n    Fashoda. It went on to say that he had concluded a treaty with the\r\n    Shilluk chiefs by which they placed the country under the\r\n    protection of France, and that he had sent this treaty to his\r\n    Government for ratification by way of Abyssinia, as well as by the\r\n    Bahr-el-Ghazal. He described his fight with the dervishes on\r\n    August 25, and stated that, in anticipation of a second and more\r\n    serious attack, he had sent his steamer south for reinforcements,\r\n    but that our arrival had prevented a further attack.\r\n\r\n    \"When we arrived at Fashoda, M. Marchand and M. Germain came on\r\n    board our steamer, and I at once informed them that the presence\r\n    of a French party at Fashoda and in the Nile valley must be\r\n    considered as a direct infringement of the rights of Egypt and of\r\n    the British Government, and I protested in the strongest terms\r\n    against the occupation of Fashoda by M. Marchand and his party,\r\n    and the hoisting of the French flag in the dominions of his\r\n    Highness the Khedive. M. Marchand stated, in reply, that he had\r\n    received precise orders for the occupation of the country and the\r\n    hoisting of the French flag over the Government buildings at\r\n    Fashoda, and added that, without the orders of his Government,\r\n    which, however, he expected would not be delayed, it was\r\n    impossible for him to retire from the place. I then inquired of\r\n    him whether, in view of the fact that I was accompanied by a\r\n    superior force, he was prepared to resist the hoisting of the\r\n    Egyptian flag at Fashoda. He hesitated, and replied that he could\r\n    not resist. The Egyptian flag was then hoisted, about 500 yards\r\n    south of the French flag, on a ruined bastion of the old Egyptian\r\n    fortifications, commanding the only road which leads into the\r\n    interior from the French position. The latter is entirely\r\n    surrounded to the north by impassable marshes.\r\n\r\n    \"Before leaving for the south I handed to M. Marchand a formal\r\n    written protest on the part of the Governments of Great Britain\r\n    and Egypt against any occupation of any part of the Nile valley\r\n    by France, as being an infringement of the rights of those\r\n    Governments. I added that I could not recognise the occupation by\r\n    France of any part of the Nile valley.\r\n\r\n    \"I left at Fashoda a garrison of one Soudanese battalion, four\r\n    guns, and a gunboat under Major Jackson, whom I appointed\r\n    Commandant of the Fashoda district, and I proceeded to Sobat,\r\n    where the flag was hoisted and a post established on September 20.\r\n    We did not see or hear anything of the Abyssinians on the Sobat,\r\n    but were informed that their nearest post was about 350 miles up\r\n    that river. The Bahr-el-Jebel being entirely blocked by floating\r\n    weed, I gave orders for a gunboat to patrol up the Bahr-el-Ghazal\r\n    in the direction of Meshra-er-Rek. As we passed Fashoda on the\r\n    return journey north, I sent M. Marchand a letter stating that all\r\n    transport of war material on the Nile was absolutely prohibited,\r\n    as the country was under military law. The chief of the Shilluk\r\n    tribe, accompanied by a large number of followers, has come into\r\n    Major Jackson's camp. He entirely denies having made any treaty\r\n    with the French, and the entire tribe express the greatest delight\r\n    at returning to allegiance to us.\r\n\r\n    \"M. Marchand is in want of ammunition and supplies, and any that\r\n    may be sent to him must take months to arrive at their\r\n    destination. He is cut off from the interior, and is quite\r\n    inadequately provided with water transport. Moreover, he has no\r\n    following in the country, and nothing could have saved his\r\n    expedition from being annihilated by the dervishes if we had been\r\n    a fortnight later in crushing the Khalifa.\"\r\n\r\nThe gist of this despatch was communicated to the French Government,\r\naccompanied by a notification that the Sirdar's \"language and\r\nproceedings\" had the complete approval of Lord Salisbury. M. Delcasse\r\nwas evidently at his wits' end to escape from an _impasse_ which was\r\nchiefly of his own creation.\r\n\r\nIn an interview with Sir E. Monson on September 27 he wished to put\r\noff a final decision till he had received the despatches which M.\r\nMarchand had forwarded in duplicate by way of the French Congo and\r\nAbyssinia respectively.\r\n\r\n    \"To gain time, M. Delcasse,\" writes our Ambassador, \"wished that I\r\n    should request your lordship to consent to a telegram being sent\r\n    by the French agent at Cairo to Khartoum, to be forwarded from\r\n    thence up the Nile to Fashoda. The telegram would contain\r\n    instructions to M. Marchand to send at once one of the French\r\n    officers serving on his mission to Cairo with a copy of his\r\n    above-mentioned report, so that the French Government might learn\r\n    its contents as soon as possible. They were, of course, ready to\r\n    bear all the expense.\r\n\r\n    \"Stress was laid by M. Delcasse upon the great desire entertained\r\n    at Paris to prevent any serious difficulty from arising; at the\r\n    same time, he felt convinced, especially in view of the conduct of\r\n    the Sirdar at Fashoda, acting as he undoubtedly was under\r\n    instructions, that Her Majesty's Government were as anxious as the\r\n    French Government to avoid a conflict.\r\n\r\n    \"I told M. Delcasse in reply that I must conclude from the\r\n    language which he had held that the French Government had decided\r\n    that they would not recall M. Marchand before receiving his\r\n    report, and I asked if I was right in this conclusion. I pointed\r\n    out to his Excellency that M. Marchand himself is stated to be\r\n    desirous of retiring from his position, which appeared to be a\r\n    disagreeable one. Such being the case, I must urgently press him\r\n    to tell me whether he refused at once to recall M. Marchand.\r\n\r\n    \"After considering his reply for some few minutes, his Excellency\r\n    said that he himself was ready to discuss the question in the most\r\n    conciliatory spirit, but I must not ask him for the impossible.\r\n\r\n    \"I pointed out that your lordship's telegram of the 9th inst.,\r\n    which I had communicated to him at the time, had made him aware\r\n    that Her Majesty's Government considered that there could be no\r\n    discussion upon such questions as the right of Egypt to Fashoda.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Lord Salisbury replied next day:\r\n\r\n    \"Her Majesty's Government cannot decline to assist in forwarding a\r\n    message from the French Agent in Egypt to a French explorer who\r\n    is on the Upper Nile in a difficult position, and your Excellency\r\n    is authorised to inform M. Delcasse that Her Majesty's Acting\r\n    Agent at Cairo will be instructed to transmit to Omdurman\r\n    immediately any such message, and at the same time to request Sir\r\n    H. Kitchener to forward it thence to its destination by any\r\n    opportunity which may be available.\r\n\r\n    \"Her Majesty's Government do not desire to be made acquainted with\r\n    the purport of the message. But you must explain that they are\r\n    unable to accept any responsibility for the results to the safety\r\n    or health of the explorer which the delay in quitting his present\r\n    situation may bring about.\"\r\n\r\nThe official papers closed with the following laconic despatch from\r\nLord Salisbury to Sir E. Monson, bearing date 3rd October.\r\n\r\n    \"I request your Excellency to inform the French Minister for\r\n    Foreign Affairs that, in accordance with his wish, his message for\r\n    M. Marchand has been transmitted to Khartoum, and will be\r\n    forwarded thence to its destination. In order to avoid any\r\n    misunderstanding, you should state to M. Delcasse that the fact of\r\n    Her Majesty's Government having complied with his Excellency's\r\n    request in regard to the transmission of the message does not\r\n    imply the slightest modification of the views previously expressed\r\n    by them. You should add that, whether in times of Egyptian or\r\n    Dervish dominion, the region in which M. Marchand was found has\r\n    never been without an owner, and that, in the view of Her\r\n    Majesty's Government, his expedition into it with an escort of 100\r\n    Senegalese troops has no political effect, nor can any political\r\n    significance be attached to it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the appendix were given past speeches and despatches by M. Decrais,\r\nM. Hanotaux, Lord Kimberley, Sir E. Grey, etc.\r\n\r\nThe rest can be quickly told. Military and naval preparations for war\r\nin both countries were redoubled and the public tone was bellicose.\r\nConsols were affected and war appeared almost inevitable. It was\r\nan occasion for union among all who rightly set patriotism above\r\nparty. Lord Rosebery, Late Premier, with splendid grace and\r\ndisinterestedness, in a speech, 13th October, voiced the sentiment of\r\nthe masses and classes. His lordship said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Behind the policy of the British Government in this matter there\r\n    is the untiring and united strength of the nation itself.\r\n    (Cheers.) It is the policy of the last Government deliberately\r\n    adopted and sustained by the present Government. (Cheers.) That is\r\n    only a matter of form, but it is the policy of the nation itself,\r\n    and no Government that attempted to recede from or palter with\r\n    that policy would last a week. (Loud cheers.) I am perfectly\r\n    certain that no idea or intention of any weakening on this point\r\n    or this question has entered the head of Her Majesty's present\r\n    advisers.\"\r\n\r\nMessages were transmitted up the Nile to Major Marchand at Fashoda. In\r\nresponse thereto he sent Captain Baratier down with despatches. That\r\nofficer arrived with Slatin Pasha in Cairo on the 20th October. His\r\ndespatches were wired to Paris, for which Baratier himself started\r\nnext day. It happened that the Sirdar, who also left for England on\r\nthat date, was a fellow-traveller with him. Another hitch occurred,\r\nthe French Government stating that Marchand's report made no allusion\r\nto the meeting with the Sirdar at Fashoda. That they would have to\r\nwait for before giving an answer. Marchand, it was alleged, had not\r\nhad time to bring his report down to date, when Baratier left him.\r\nThey had not long to wait, for suddenly the announcement was sprung\r\nthat Major Marchand, acting on his own volition, had left Fashoda and\r\nwas coming down by Khedivial transport, to Cairo. He arrived in that\r\ncity on the evening of 3rd November, and got a deservedly hearty\r\nreception from the English as well as the French community. Prominent\r\nofficials, civil and military, were there to greet the brave and hardy\r\nexplorer. His companion, Captain Baratier, who had been to Paris and\r\nhad hastened back intending to return to Fashoda, met the Major next\r\nday in Cairo. But on the very day that Major Marchand reached Cairo,\r\nthe French Government had issued an official note stating it had been\r\ndecided to evacuate Fashoda, as the position had been reported\r\nuntenable. So saying \"No, no, they would ne'er consent,\" they\r\nconsented.\r\n\r\nAt the Mansion House banquet given to the Sirdar, on 4th November,\r\nLord Salisbury said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I received from the French Ambassador this afternoon the\r\n    information that the French Government had come to the conclusion\r\n    that the (Fashoda) occupation was of no sort of value to the\r\n    French Republic, and they thought that under those circumstances,\r\n    to persist in an occupation which only cost them money and did\r\n    harm, merely because some of their advisers thought they would be\r\n    an unwelcome neighbour, would not show the wisdom with which the\r\n    French Republic has uniformly been guided. They have done what I\r\n    believe every Government would have done in the same\r\n    position--they have resolved that the occupation must cease. A\r\n    formal intimation to that effect was made to me this afternoon,\r\n    and it has been conveyed to the French authorities at Cairo. I do\r\n    not wish to be misunderstood as saying that all causes of\r\n    controversy are by this removed between the French Government and\r\n    ourselves. It is probably not so, and it may be that we shall have\r\n    many discussions in the future, but a cause of controversy of a\r\n    singularly acute and somewhat dangerous character has been\r\n    removed, and we cannot but congratulate ourselves upon it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same connection it is of interest to learn what Major Marchand\r\nhad to say. The full text of his speech made at a banquet given to him\r\nand Captain Baratier by the French Club at Cairo on the 7th October\r\nappeared in the Press. In the presence of the Acting French Diplomatic\r\nAgent and others, Major Marchand said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Monsieur le Ministre de France, Monsieur le President,\r\n    Messieurs--There are two reasons why you will not expect a speech\r\n    from me. In the first place I am only a soldier and no orator; and\r\n    then one cannot be talkative on a day of reflection, a day which\r\n    brings to me personally a great sorrow, the official abandonment\r\n    of Fashoda. Fashoda! it was only a point--it is true that it\r\n    synthetised everything. But if we lose the point we abandon\r\n    nothing of our thesis. To reflect is not to despair--on the\r\n    contrary. The experiences of this world teach us that the sum of\r\n    our sorrows is not greater than that of our joys. The more the\r\n    black period may be prolonged the more quickly will approach the\r\n    dawn of proud aspirations at length realised. And the granite\r\n    Sphinx which near at hand dreams on the desert sands, the Sphinx\r\n    which saw the passage of Bonaparte, which saw Lesseps and his\r\n    work, has not yet uttered its last word, has not murmured the\r\n    supreme sentence. The more fiercely evil fortune may pursue us the\r\n    more should we call to our aid the great hopes which swell the\r\n    heart and fortify the will. The French colony in Cairo, moreover,\r\n    has shown more than ten times over already that it knows no\r\n    discouragement. I should like, my dear and valiant compatriots, to\r\n    give you some small recompense. Listen! When, nearly three years\r\n    ago, the Congo-Nile mission left France, it was not in order to\r\n    make a more or less famous journey of exploration. No, its aim was\r\n    far higher. You have already guessed it. Why, then, proclaim it\r\n    here? We desired (here the speaker paused a moment) to carry\r\n    across French Africa to the French in Egypt a hand-grip from the\r\n    French of France. The road was long, sometimes hard; we have\r\n    reached our destination, however, since I have the honour to greet\r\n    you here to-day. Do you not see a symbol in this? Fortune, which\r\n    detests broad and easy paths, is perhaps at this moment on her\r\n    way, bringing you the succour so patiently looked for. We must\r\n    never despair, and who can say that the Sphinx may not be about to\r\n    smile? It is for this that I have come to tell you that if we are\r\n    few to-day we shall be many to-morrow--who forget nothing, who\r\n    abandon nothing. It is with this thought that I drink to your\r\n    health, gentlemen, the health of the French colony in Egypt. To\r\n    the Greater France!\"\r\n\r\nIt is easy to feel great sympathy with so gallant and hardy a soldier,\r\nwho, having successfully accomplished the perilous mission entrusted\r\nto him by his Government, found support denied him and his work\r\nfruitless. Major Marchand and Captain Baratier again availed\r\nthemselves of the Egyptian military transport to return to their\r\ncomrades. At half-past 8 a.m., 11th December, the French hauled down\r\ntheir flag at Fashoda, and left for the Sobat river. They were\r\nintending to make their way up that stream to the nearest Abyssinian\r\npost, and thereafter, striking through Menelik's country, hoped to\r\narrive on the East African coast at Djibutil. Their sick comrades they\r\nentrusted to the Egyptian military authorities to send home by the\r\nNile through Lower Egypt. The invalided Frenchmen and Senegalese in\r\nquestion reached Cairo at the end of the year.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was only to be expected that the French press and\r\npoliticians would display increased virulence against this country\r\nover the Fashoda settlement. But their persistence in that course, and\r\nthe fact of their present extraordinary naval expenditure, can only\r\nmean getting ready for war against Great Britain. This may lead our\r\npeople to consider whether it would not be cheapest and wisest to\r\nsettle the quarrel off-hand. True, delay makes for peace, but a peace\r\nthat is to be a struggle to overtop one another in armaments may be\r\nmore costly in every sense than sharp and decisive warfare. The chief\r\ncause of the soreness in France against us is our presence in Egypt.\r\nYet the French have no such vital interest there as this country has.\r\nTo many of our colonies and dependencies the shortest way lies through\r\nEgypt. Again, the French form quite a minority in numbers and wealth\r\namong the foreign communities in Egypt. Since 1882, the year of\r\noccupation, Great Britain has been careful to avoid interference with\r\nthe privileges and rights of all foreigners. In what community\r\ncontrolled by France through sixteen years would it have been allowed\r\nthat an alien language should be maintained in use in public places.\r\nNo official step has been taken to diminish the use of French in\r\nstreet nomenclature, or public conveyances, or public departments in\r\nEgypt until last year. Arabic is the language of the people, and\r\nEnglish is the language of commerce in the country. A sensible change\r\nin the direction indicated is at last evident, even in Cairo and\r\nAlexandria. Shops and warehouses are displaying Anglo-Saxon signs, and\r\nthe natives are discarding French and are speaking English as the one\r\nforeign language necessary to acquire.\r\n\r\nThere has been talk among our neighbours of emulating the Sirdar's\r\nenterprise and founding French colleges at Khartoum and Fashoda. But\r\nurged by less disinterested motives they may find it necessary instead\r\nto devote their funds to the cultivation of the Gallic tongue in Lower\r\nand Upper Egypt, rather than in the Soudan. In the year 1897, in\r\nTantah, the third largest town in the Delta, there were 130 scholars\r\nlearning French and but 40 studying English. In 1898 there were 98 at\r\nthe English classes and but a moiety at the French. The scholastic\r\nyear 1899, according to the officials of the Public Instruction\r\nDepartment, will see a farther and even more serious decline in the\r\nstudy of the French language. The French officials themselves are\r\npainfully aware that the Gallic speech, for colloquial intercourse\r\nbetween educated natives and Europeans, is doomed if matters continue\r\nas at present. In Assouan, where during 1897 much the same state of\r\nthings prevailed as at Tantah; in 1898 there were 118 scholars\r\nlearning English and but three at the French classes.\r\n\r\nUntil quite recently, it was wont to be the case in Lower Egypt that\r\nthere were always two pupils learning French to one devoting attention\r\nto acquiring English. In Upper Egypt of late years the difference had\r\nnot been so marked, the proportion of French and English students\r\nbeing about equal. These figures refer to primary classes in Upper\r\nEgypt, and to secondary, as well as primary, classes in Cairo and\r\nAlexandria. As a matter of fact, the results of the examinations did\r\nnot follow in quite the same proportion in the Delta. About three\r\npupils have passed in French to two in English. Shortly after the\r\nbattle of Omdurman, applications had to be made for entrance into the\r\nschool classes for English and French tuition. In a great number of\r\nschools, in both Upper and Lower Egypt, especially in the stronghold\r\nof the French tongue--the Delta--not a single application was made by\r\ncandidates for entrance to the second primaries, in which French\r\nteaching begins. That means to say that there will a dearth and\r\npractically a cessation of French teaching in 1899 in the primary\r\nschools, and subsequently, or in 1900, the year of the Exposition\r\nUniverselle at Paris, a total discontinuance of it in the secondary\r\nschools. Taking the secondary schools examinations throughout the\r\nwhole of Lower Egypt by themselves, I learn that in 1898, although\r\nthere were a larger proportion of candidates for French certificates\r\nof proficiency, yet the numbers that actually passed in each language\r\nwere about the same. The Examining Commissioners are Egyptian,\r\nEnglish, and French.\r\n\r\nIt is in Egypt as in certain other countries. The great ambition of\r\nevery lad is to get into the Government service, and failing that to\r\nbecome a lawyer. Law schools are therefore well attended. Heretofore\r\nbudding lawyers have been taught in French classes only. An\r\nEnglish-speaking law section was started in 1898. The natives are\r\nquick to appreciate any change which is to their advantage. Pupils in\r\nthe secondary schools have now opened to them careers which have\r\nheretofore been closed. There is in truth a silent, but certain to be\r\neffective, educational and social revolution begun in Egypt. No more\r\nwill every whim and caprice of those who seek to obstruct the advance\r\nof the Egyptians be tolerated. In 1899 for the first time examining\r\neducational centres will be established at Assouan and Suakin. All\r\nthose south of Assiut will be for English students only, for French\r\nwill be quite dropped. Not only will there be a college at Khartoum\r\nbut one at Kassala, where English as well as Arabic will be taught. In\r\na new and thorough manner has the regeneration of Egypt and the Soudan\r\nbeen undertaken. The dream of a red English through-traffic line from\r\nCairo to Cape Town will have a speedy realisation. Possibly within\r\neighteen months the railway will be carried to the Sobat. Certainly\r\nbefore 1899 is ended there will be through communication with\r\nKhartoum. Mr Cecil Rhodes is busy with his South African lines, which\r\nby that time should be up to the Zambesi, and within three years after\r\nthere will possibly be open rail and water communication from the\r\nMediterranean to Cape Town. But before then the telegraph wire will\r\nbind North and South Africa together, and to the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis volume was written and in the printer's hands when an article by\r\na Mr E. N. Bennett appeared in the columns of _The Contemporary\r\nReview_, entitled \"After Omdurman.\" That gentleman made a series of\r\ngrave charges reflecting upon the Anglo-Egyptian arms, not only during\r\nthe Khartoum Expedition, but also on their conduct in Egypt and the\r\nSoudan since 1882. In the _Daily Telegraph_ and elsewhere I have\r\ndeservedly stigmatised Mr Bennett's allegations as untrue, stupid, and\r\nwantonly mischievous.\r\n\r\nIn the pages of _The Khartoum Campaign, 1898_, can be read the\r\ndetailed version of events which happened in the field \"before\" as\r\nwell as \"after\" Omdurman. I venture to think that abundant refutation\r\nwill be found in the Work of most of Mr Bennett's scandalous\r\nassertions. Although it may seem to lend further temporary importance\r\nto what that gentleman has written, as his accusations were made\r\npublic under the cover of a respectable magazine, perhaps a few words\r\nmore may not be out of place.\r\n\r\nMr Bennett's article was seemingly framed on the specious pretext of,\r\nunder a discussion of the principles of international law, questions\r\nof belligerency, Geneva Convention rules, and so forth, to base\r\nthereon a claim for the treatment of dervishes as combatants entitled\r\nto all the amenities of civilised warfare. Several pages of his\r\ncomposition are given up to treating upon that matter. For instance,\r\nhe says--\"Moreover, it is worth remembering that the dervishes were\r\nnot 'savages' in the sense in which the word is applied to the\r\nfollowers of a Lobengula or a Samory. On the contrary, they satisfied\r\nall the requirements for recognition as an armed force.\" Now, that is\r\nan aspersion upon Lobengula and Samory in particular. For unredeemed\r\ndevilishness, the dervishes have had no equals. The fact is, that the\r\nMahdists made it a constant practice to ruthlessly slaughter all\r\nprisoners in battle, wounded or unwounded; to enslave, torture, or\r\nmurder their enemies, active or passive; to loot and to burn; to slay\r\nchildren and debauch women. To set up a pretext that such monsters are\r\nentitled to the grace and consideration of the most humane laws, is to\r\nbeggar commonsense and yap intolerable humbug. Yet British\r\nself-respect was such, Mr Bennett to the contrary notwithstanding,\r\nthat the dervishes were treated as men, and not as wild beasts.\r\n\r\nStarted upon his false pursuit, Mr Bennett proceeds from error to\r\nerror, abounding in reckless misstatements, atrocious imputations, and\r\nscattering charges void of truth. As briefly as possible, I will deal\r\nwith his accusations. One of his first deliverances is as\r\nfollows:--\"It is, of course, an open secret that in all our Soudan\r\nbattles the enemy's wounded have been killed. The practice has, ever\r\nsince the days of Tel-el-Kebir, become traditional in Soudanese\r\nwarfare. After the battle of Atbara, it was announced that 3000\r\ndervishes had been killed. There was practically no mention of the\r\nwounded.... How, then, was it that no wounded were accounted for at\r\nthe Atbara?\" Again he writes:--\"But I cannot help thinking that if the\r\nkilling of the wounded had been sternly repressed at Tel-el-Kebir and\r\nduring the earlier Soudan campaigns, our dervish enemies would have\r\nlearned to expect civilised treatment,\" etc. Gaining courage, probably\r\nfrom his own audacity, Mr Bennett had the hardihood to virtually\r\ndeclare that the cruelties permitted by British officers made the\r\ndervishes what they were.\r\n\r\nNow, I went through the 1882 war in Egypt as well as most of the\r\ncampaigns in the Soudan. I am therefore in a better position than he\r\nto declare, that his allegations are a perversion of the truth. It was\r\nneither the practice at Tel-el-Kebir nor subsequent thereto for\r\nBritish led troops to kill wounded men. The insinuation that they did\r\nso, or connived at such slaughter, is a stupid or a malicious\r\nfalsehood. In every battle within the period referred to, large\r\nnumbers of wounded and unwounded prisoners were taken, and invariably\r\ngreat lenience was shown. Surgical treatment also was, whenever\r\npossible, always promptly rendered. Indeed, they were in countless\r\ncases treated as tenderly as our own wounded. This further: in action\r\nthere are no soldiers less prone to needless blood-spilling, or men\r\nreadier to forgive and forget, than \"Tommy Atkins.\" Official returns\r\nexist setting at rest the fiction about Tel-el-Kebir and the Soudan\r\nbattles. At Tel-el-Kebir many thousand prisoners were made, and in\r\nother engagements our hands were always full of dervish wounded. At\r\nEl Teb, Tamai, Abu Klea, Abu Kru, Gemaizeh, Atbara, and elsewhere,\r\nwounded dervishes fell into our hands, and received every attention\r\nfrom the medical staff. And in some of these actions our troops were\r\nthemselves in sore straits. Several hundred dervishes were picked up\r\nwithin and without the Atbara dem, including the leader Mahmoud and\r\nhis two cousins. Be it remembered, our troops only remained there a\r\nfew hours, marching back to the Nile.\r\n\r\nStill further abominable charges Mr Bennett lays at the door of his\r\ncountrymen who command British and Khedivial troops. The Sirdar\r\nhimself is included in his rigmarole of accusations. But whether\r\ndealing with particulars or the general course of events, Mr Bennett\r\ndiscloses that he has scarcely a nodding acquaintanceship with truth.\r\nHe has said:--\"This wholesale slaughter was not confined to Arab\r\nservants,\" _i.e._, killing wounded dervishes. \"The Soudanese seemed to\r\nrevel in the work, and continually drove their bayonets through men\r\nwho were absolutely unconscious.... This unsoldierly work was not even\r\nleft to the exclusive control of the black troops; our British\r\nsoldiers took part in it.\"\r\n\r\nOn whatever ground Mr Bennett may seek to support these assertions,\r\nthey are unwarranted and untruthful libels. There was no wholesale\r\nslaughter of wounded dervishes, nor was there anything done in the\r\nleast justifying or providing a decent pretext for that ferocious\r\naccusation. Very many thousands of dervish wounded fell into our hands\r\nthat day and later. Officers have written to the press, denying these\r\ncharges and the rest of Mr Bennett's tale of monstrosity. The Sirdar\r\nhimself has confirmed by a personal cablegram my refutation of them.\r\nHere is another of Mr Bennett's suggestions of evil-doing, by innuendo\r\nand assertion:--\"It was stated that orders had been given to kill the\r\nwounded.\" And, \"If the Sirdar really believes that the destruction of\r\nthe wounded was a military necessity,\" etc. Can colossal crassness go\r\nfurther? There is not and never was a scintilla of truth for the\r\ncharge of wholesale slaughtering of wounded dervishes, nor that the\r\nSirdar ever issued such an order, or that any reputable person ever\r\nreceived it, or ever had it hinted to him. The accusation is an\r\nunmitigated untruth, and absolutely at variance with all that was said\r\nand done by the Sirdar before and during the course of the battle and\r\nthe pursuit. I certainly never heard of the matter until Mr Bennett\r\nmade the accusation, and I cannot trace its authorship beyond himself.\r\nFrom the Sirdar down, contradictions of the charge have deservedly\r\nbeen slapped in Mr Bennett's face.\r\n\r\nBut it is almost sheer waste of words to follow and refute line by\r\nline the article \"After Omdurman.\" Other of Mr Bennett's accusations\r\nwere: that the 21st Lancers, on the way to the front, robbed\r\nhen-roosts and stricken villagers; that once in Omdurman the Soudanese\r\ntroops abandoned discipline, looted, ravished, and murdered the whole\r\nnight long; that on land and water our cannon and Maxims were\r\ndeliberately turned upon unarmed flying inhabitants, massacring,\r\nwithout pity, men, women, and children. An these charges had been\r\ntrue, I should have hastened to denounce the culprits, whoever they\r\nwere, in the interests of humanity and country. Happily, Mr Bennett's\r\ntale is utterly without foundation, whatever reflection that casts\r\nupon his condition. The Lancers passed through nothing but deserted\r\nvillages, where there were neither natives nor roosts to rob, even had\r\nthey been so disposed. As for the Soudanese troops, their discipline\r\nthroughout was perfect; there was no looting, no ravishing nor murder\r\ndone by them or any other divisions of the soldiery. Nor did our\r\ngunners on shore or afloat ever fire upon unarmed people. Let it be\r\nrecalled that those whom Mr Bennett so flippantly accuses are\r\nhonourable gentlemen and fellow-countrymen. Three things in this\r\nconnection are worthy of special note. When the first dervish attack\r\nupon our zereba was repulsed and Wad Melik's dead, dying and shamming\r\nwarriors carpeted the north slopes of Jebel Surgham and the plain in\r\nfront. \"Cease fire\" was sounded. Thereafter the dervishes arose from\r\nthe ground in hundreds and thousands and walked off, without awakening\r\na renewal of our fire from cannon, Maxims, or rifles. At the entry\r\ninto Omdurman the artillery and gunboats were ordered to be careful\r\nhow they fired, and grave risks were incurred by the Sirdar and staff\r\nin personally counselling to friend and foe a cessation of fighting.\r\n\r\nInaccuracy and sensationalism Mr Bennett is welcome to, and to the\r\nsort of notoriety it has brought him. Cheap maudlin sentiment may\r\nprofess a pity for those \"dervish homes ruined\" by the successes of\r\nBritish arms. The dervishes in their day had no homes. Nay, they made\r\nhonest profession that their mission was to destroy other people's,\r\nand do without carking domesticity, as that detracted from the merit\r\nof preparation for paradise. As I have elsewhere said, one of the\r\n\"fads\" of the day is to hold that liberalism of mind is always\r\ncharacterised by being a friend to every country and race but your\r\nown. Exact truth is as illusive to discovery by that as other\r\npernicious methods. That there may have been one or two instances of\r\ncruelty practised on the battle-field is possible. Something of the\r\nkind always takes place in warfare as in everyday life. But only the\r\namateur would magnify a few instances into a catalogue of charges.\r\nAlas! you cannot eliminate from armies, any more than from ordinary\r\ncommunities, the foolish, insane, and criminal.\r\n\r\n                                                           THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\nLONDON, _February 1899_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEILL AND COMPANY, LTD., PRINTERS, EDINBURGH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FOURTH IMPRESSION NOW READY._\r\n\r\nSIRDAR AND KHALIFA;\r\n\r\nOR THE\r\n\r\nRE-CONQUEST OF THE SOUDAN.\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nBENNET BURLEIGH.\r\n\r\nWITH PORTRAITS, NUMEROUS ILLUSTRATIONS, MAPS, AND PLAN OF BATTLE.\r\n\r\nDEMY 8vo, 12s.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAILY NEWS says:--\"Picturesque, spirited, and trustworthy\r\nnarrative.... The book comprises a summary of the military situation,\r\nand a glance at the probable course of the renewed operations which\r\nare now on the point of commencing.\"\r\n\r\nTHE PALL MALL GAZETTE says:--\"Nothing could be more timely. It is\r\nunnecessary at this time of day to speak of Mr Burleigh's familiar\r\nstyle ... always to the point, clear, and vigorous; or of his\r\nmatter--the matter of an experienced, shrewd, and fearless war\r\ncorrespondent. The book is just the book for the occasion, and will\r\nmake the tale that is coming directly more real to many of us. Mr\r\nBurleigh gives a few useful introductory chapters dealing with\r\nprevious events, and a very interesting account of a trip to Kassala,\r\n'our new possession'; but in the main it is the story of the Atbara\r\nCampaign. The book makes good reading, entirely apart from its timely\r\ninstructiveness.\"\r\n\r\nTHE ST JAMES'S GAZETTE says:--\"Its real value to the judicious reader\r\nlies in the fact that it is a faithful record by a highly skilled\r\nobserver of the day-by-day life of an Anglo-Egyptian Army engaged in\r\ndesert warfare. The country itself--river and wilderness--the rival\r\nleaders, the soldiery, their appearance, arms, and uniform, their\r\neating and drinking, their lying down and their rising up, their\r\nmarching and the final rush of battle--these are all here before us in\r\na living picture, making the book in reality an invaluable 'vade\r\nmecum' for those who wish to realise just what it is that our men are\r\ndoing to-day between the Atbara and Omdurman.\"\r\n\r\nTHE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE says:--\"The book is profoundly interesting.\r\nReaders familiar with the author's letters in _The Daily Telegraph_ do\r\nnot need to be told that he is a master of vivid and picturesque\r\nnarrative. Mr Burleigh has been an eye-witness during the course of\r\nall the campaigns in the Soudan in which British troops have been\r\nemployed, and therefore writes out of full knowledge and experience.\"\r\n\r\nTHE MORNING POST says:--\"Many chapters are devoted to the Atbara\r\nCampaign and the incidents connected with it, the storming of\r\nMahmoud's entrenched Camp on the 7th of April last, and interviews\r\nwith that Emir after he was taken prisoner. Mr Burleigh's book, it\r\nwill be sufficient to say, should prove very useful to all who follow\r\nthe progress of the Force now advancing on Omdurman. In a\r\nsupplementary chapter will be found official despatches, and the work\r\nis provided with a map of the Soudan, and plans of the Battle of the\r\nAtbara and of the Island of Meroe, showing positions before the\r\nbattle. The illustrations are numerous. Among them is a frontispiece\r\nportrait of the Sirdar.\"\r\n\r\nTHE DAILY CHRONICLE says:--\"We are given a connected and very\r\ncomprehensible account of all the operations up to the destruction of\r\nMahmoud's host and the Sirdar's triumphant return to Berber.... The\r\ndescription of the main battle itself is very vivid and complete.\"\r\n\r\nTHE SCOTSMAN says:--\"Mr Bennet Burleigh's new volume, 'Sirdar and\r\nKhalifa,' comes just in the nick of time. Its object is to recount the\r\nstory of the reconquest of the Soudan up to the Battle of Atbara.... A\r\nvery readable book.\"\r\n\r\nTHE DAILY TELEGRAPH says:--\"Readers of _The Daily Telegraph_ will not\r\nbe chary of accepting our estimate of the value of this book when we\r\nremind them that its author is Mr Bennet Burleigh, who has acted\r\nthroughout the numerous campaigns which have been waged in the Soudan\r\nas the War Correspondent of this journal, and gained himself a\r\nwell-merited reputation for his pluck in the face of the enemy, his\r\nendurance of hardship and fatigue, his excellence of judgment, and his\r\ngraphic descriptions of the shock of battle.... It only remains to say\r\nthat this book is well illustrated, handsomely printed, and is in\r\nevery way a worthy record of a brief but memorable campaign.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Khartoum Campaign, 1898, by Bennet Burleigh",
