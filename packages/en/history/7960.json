It should meet\r\nthe requirements of those high schools and preparatory schools where\r\nancient history, as a separate discipline, is being supplanted by a more\r\nextended course introductory to the study of recent times and contemporary\r\nproblems. Such a course was first outlined by the Regents of the\r\nUniversity of the State of New York in their _Syllabus for Secondary\r\nSchools_, issued in 1910.\r\n\r\nSince the appearance of the Regents' _Syllabus_ the Committee of Five of\r\nthe American Historical Association has made its _Report_ (1911),\r\nsuggesting a rearrangement of the curriculum which would permit a year's\r\nwork in English and Continental history. Still more recently the Committee\r\non Social Studies of the Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary\r\nEducation, in its _Report_ (1916) to the National Education Association\r\nhas definitely recommended the division of European history into two\r\nparts, of which the first should include ancient and Oriental\r\ncivilization, English and Continental history to approximately the end of\r\nthe seventeenth century, and the period of American exploration.\r\n\r\nThe first twelve chapters of the present work are based upon the author's\r\n_Ancient History_, published four years ago. In spite of many omissions,\r\nit has been possible to follow without essential modification the plan of\r\nthe earlier volume. A number of new maps and illustrations have been added\r\nto these chapters.\r\n\r\nThe selection of collateral reading, always a difficult problem in the\r\nsecondary school, is doubly difficult when so much ground must be covered\r\nin a single course. The author ventures, therefore, to call attention to\r\nhis _Readings in Ancient History_. Its purpose, in the words of the\r\npreface, is \"to provide immature pupils with a variety of extended,\r\nunified, and interesting extracts on matters which a textbook treats with\r\nnecessary, though none the less deplorable, condensation.\" A companion\r\nvolume, entitled _Readings in Medieval and Modern History_, will be\r\npublished shortly. References to both books are inserted in footnotes.\r\n\r\nAt the end of what has been a long and engrossing task, it becomes a\r\npleasant duty to acknowledge the help which has been received from\r\nteachers in school and college. Various chapters, either in manuscript or\r\nin the proofs, have been read by Professor James M. Leake of Bryn Mawr\r\nCollege; Professor J. C. Hildt of Smith College; Very Rev. Patrick J.\r\nHealy, Professor of Church History in the Catholic University of America;\r\nProfessor E. F. Humphrey of Trinity College; Dr. James Sullivan, Director\r\nof the Division of Archives and History, State Dept. of Education of New\r\nYork; Constantine E. McGuire, Assistant Secretary General, International\r\nHigh Commission, Washington; Miss Margaret E. McGill, of the Newton\r\n(Mass.) High School; and Miss Mabel Chesley, of the Erasmus Hall High\r\nSchool, Brooklyn. The author would also express appreciation of the labors\r\nof the cartographers, artists, and printers, to whose accuracy and skill\r\nevery page of the book bears witness.\r\n\r\nHUTTON WEBSTER\r\n\r\nLINCOLN, NEBRASKA, February, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL GEMS.\r\n   1   Steatite from Crete, two lions with forefeet on a pedestal, above\r\n       a sun\r\n   2   Sardonyx from Elis, a goddess holding up a goat by the horns\r\n   3   Rock crystal a bearded Triton\r\n   4   Carnelian, a youth playing a trigonon\r\n   5   Chalcedony from Athens, a Bacchante\r\n   6   Sard, a woman reading a manuscript roll, before her a lyre\r\n   7   Carnelian, Theseus\r\n   8   Chalcedony, portrait head, Hellenistic Age\r\n   9   Aquamarine, portrait of Julia daughter of the emperor Titus\r\n  10   Chalcedony, portrait head, Hellenistic Age\r\n  11   Carnelian, bust portrait of the Roman emperor Decius\r\n  12   Beryl, portrait of Julia Domna wife of the emperor Septimius\r\n       Severus\r\n  13   Sapphire, head of the Madonna\r\n  14   Carnelian, the judgment of Paris, Renaissance work\r\n  15   Rock crystal, Madonna with Jesus and St. Joseph, probably Norman\r\n       Sicilian work]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\nLIST OF MAPS\r\n\r\nLIST OF PLATES\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY\r\n\r\nCHAPTER\r\n\r\nI.

Y., 1895 to date, quarterly, $4.00 a year). This\r\njournal, the organ of the American Historical Association, contains\r\narticles by scholars, critical reviews of all important works, and notes\r\nand news. The _History Teacher's Magazine_ is edited under the supervision\r\nof a committee of the American Historical Association (Philadelphia, 1909\r\nto date, monthly, $2.00 a year). Every well-equipped school library should\r\ncontain the files of the _National Geographic Magazine_ (Washington, 1890\r\nto date, monthly, $2.00 a year) and of _Art and Archeology_ (Washington,\r\n1914 to date, monthly, $3.00 a year). These two periodicals make a special\r\nfeature of illustrations.\r\n\r\nWORKS ON THE STUDY AND TEACHING OF HISTORY\r\n\r\nUseful books for the teacher's library include H. E. Bourne, _The Teaching\r\nof History and Civics in the Elementary and the Secondary School_ (N. Y.,\r\n1902, Longmans, Green, and Co., $1.50), Henry Johnson, _The Teaching of\r\nHistory_ (N.

Y., 1915, Longmans, Green, and Co., 60 cents).\r\n\r\nDICTIONARIES AND ENCYCLOPEDIAS\r\n\r\nThe most useful dictionaries of classical antiquities are H. B. Walters,\r\n_A Classical Dictionary_ (N. Y., 1916, Putnam, $6.50) and H. T. Peck,\r\n_Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities_ (N. Y.,\r\n1897, American Book Co., $6.00). Cambridge University, England, has\r\npublished _A Companion to Greek Studies_, edited by L. Whibley (2d ed., N.\r\nY., 1906, Putnam, $6.00), and _A Companion to Latin Studies_, edited by J.\r\nE. Sandys (N. Y., 1911, Putnam, $6.00). These two volumes treat every\r\nphase of ancient life in separate essays by distinguished scholars. For\r\nchronology, genealogies, lists of sovereigns, and other data the most\r\nvaluable works are Arthur Hassall, _European History, 476-1910_ (new ed.,\r\nN. Y., 1910, Macmillan, $2.25), G. P. Putnam, _Tabular Views of Universal\r\nHistory_ (new ed., N. Y., 1915, Putnam, $2.50), and Karl J. Ploetz, _A\r\nHandbook of Universal History_, translated by W. H.

Y., 1911, Holt, $2.50), with about two hundred and\r\nfifty maps covering the historical field. The latest and one of the best\r\nof the classical atlases is _Murray's Small Classical Atlas_, edited by G.\r\nB. Grundy (N. Y., 1904, Oxford University Press, American Branch, $1.35).\r\nA special feature of this work is the adoption of the system of colored\r\ncontours to indicate configuration. The _Atlas of Ancient and Classical\r\nGeography_ in \"Everyman's Library\" (N. Y., 1910, Dutton, 35 cents) might\r\nwell be purchased by every student. Other valuable works are E. W. Dow,\r\n_Atlas of European History_ (N. Y., 1907, Holt, $1.50) and Ramsay Muir, _A\r\nNew School Atlas of Modern History_ (N. Y., 1911, Holt, $1.25). Much use\r\ncan be made of the inexpensive and handy _Literary and Historical Atlas of\r\nEurope_ by J. G. Bartholomew in \"Everyman's Library\" (N. Y., 1910, Dutton,\r\n35 cents).\r\n\r\nWALL MAPS AND CHARTS\r\n\r\nKiepert's _New Wall Maps of Ancient History_ (Chicago, Rand, McNally, and\r\nCo.) and Johnston's _Classical Series_ (Chicago, A. J. Nystrom and Co.)\r\nmay be obtained singly, mounted on common rollers, or by sets in a case\r\nwith spring rollers. The text is in Latin. The Spruner-Bretschneider\r\n_Historical Maps_ are ten in number, size 62 x 52 inches, and cover the\r\nperiod from A.D. 350 to 1815. The text is in German (Chicago, Nystrom,\r\neach $6.00; Rand, McNally, and Co., each $6.50). Johnston's _Maps of\r\nEnglish and European History_ are sixteen in number, size 40 x 30 inches,\r\nand include four maps of ancient history (Chicago, Nystrom, each $2.50). A\r\nnew series of _European History Maps_, thirty-nine in number, size 44 x 32\r\ninches, has been prepared for the study of ancient history by Professors\r\nJ. H. Breasted and C. F. Huth, and for medieval and modern history by\r\nProfessor S. B. Harding (Chicago, Denoyer-Geppert Co., complete set with\r\ntripod stand, $52.00; in two spring roller cases, $73.00). These maps may\r\nalso be had separately. The maps in this admirable series omit all\r\nirrelevant detail, present place names in the modern English form, and in\r\nchoice of subject matter emphasize the American viewpoint. The school\r\nshould also possess good physical wall maps such as the Sydow-Habenicht or\r\nthe Kiepert series, both to be obtained from Rand, McNally, and Co. The\r\ntext is in German. Phillips's _Model Test Maps_ and Johnston's _New Series\r\nof Physical Wall Maps_ are obtainable from A. J. Nystrom and Co. The only\r\nlarge charts available are those prepared by MacCoun for his _Historical\r\nGeography Charts of Europe_. The two sections, \"Ancient and Classical\" and\r\n\"Medieval and Modern,\" are sold separately (N. Y., Silver, Burdett, and\r\nCo., $15.00). A helpful series of _Blackboard Outline Maps_ is issued by\r\nJ. L. Engle, Beaver, Penn. These are wall maps, printed with paint on\r\nblackboard cloth, for use with an ordinary crayon. Such maps are also sold\r\nby the Denoyer-Geppert Co., Chicago.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE MAPS\r\n\r\nThe \"Studies\" following each chapter of this book include various\r\nexercises for which small outline maps are required. Such maps are sold by\r\nD. C. Heath and Co., Boston, New York, Chicago. Useful atlases of outline\r\nmaps are also to be had of the McKinley Publishing Co., Philadelphia,\r\nAtkinson, Mentzer and Grover, Chicago, W. B. Harison, New York City, and\r\nof other publishers.\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\nThe best photographs of ancient works of art must usually be obtained from\r\nthe foreign publishers in Naples, Florence, Rome, Munich, Paris, Athens,\r\nand London, or from their American agents. Such photographs, in the usual\r\nsize, 8 x 10 inches, sell, unmounted, at from 6 to 8 francs a dozen. All\r\ndealers in lantern slides issue descriptive catalogues of a great variety\r\nof archaeological subjects. In addition to photographs and lantern slides,\r\na collection of stereoscopic views is very helpful in giving vividness and\r\ninterest to instruction in ancient history. An admirable series of\r\nphotographs for the stereoscope, including Egypt, Palestine, Greece, and\r\nItaly, is issued by Underwood and Underwood, New York City. The same firm\r\nsupplies convenient maps and handbooks for use in this connection. The\r\nKeystone stereographs, prepared by the Keystone View Company, Meadville,\r\nPenn., may also be cordially recommended. The architecture, costumes,\r\namusements, and occupations of the Middle Ages in England are shown in\r\n_Longmans' Historical Illustrations_ (six portfolios, each containing\r\ntwelve plates in black-and-white, Longmans, Green, and Co., 90 cents, each\r\nportfolio). The same firm issues _Longmans' Historical Wall Pictures_,\r\nconsisting of twelve colored pictures from original paintings illustrating\r\nEnglish history (each picture, separately, 80 cents; in a portfolio,\r\n$10.50). Other notable collections are Lehmann's _Geographical Pictures,\r\nHistorical Pictures_, and _Types of Nations_, and Cybulski's _Historical\r\nPictures_ (Chicago, Denoyer-Geppert Co.; each picture separately mounted\r\non rollers, $1.35 to $2.25). The New England History Teachers' Association\r\npublishes a series of _Authentic Pictures for Class Room Use_, size 5 x 8\r\ninches, price 3 cents each. The _Catalogue of the Collection of Historical\r\nMaterial at Simmons College_, prepared by the New England History\r\nTeachers' Association (2d ed., Boston, 1912, Houghton Mifflin Co., 25\r\ncents), contains an extensive list of pictures, slides, models, and other\r\naids to history teaching. Among the more useful collections in book form\r\nof photographic reproductions and drawings are the following:\r\n\r\nFechneimer, Hedwig. _Die Plastik der Ägypter_ (2d. ed., Berlin, 1914, B.\r\nCassirer, 12 marks). 156 plates of Egyptian sculpture.\r\n\r\nFougères, Gustvae. _La vie publique et privée des Grecs et des Romains_\r\n(2d ed., Paris, 1900, Hachette, 15 francs).

THE STUDY OF HISTORY\r\n\r\nSUBJECT MATTER OF HISTORY\r\n\r\nHistory is the narrative of what civilized man has done. It deals with\r\nthose social groups called states and nations. Just as biography describes\r\nthe life of individuals, so history relates the rise, progress, and\r\ndecline of human societies.\r\n\r\nMANUSCRIPTS AND BOOKS\r\n\r\nHistory cannot go back of written records. These alone will preserve a\r\nfull and accurate account of man's achievements. Manuscripts and books\r\nform one class of written records. The old Babylonians used tablets of\r\nsoft clay, on which signs were impressed with a metal instrument. The\r\ntablets were then baked hard in an oven. The Egyptians made a kind of\r\npaper out of the papyrus, a plant native to the Nile valley. The Greeks\r\nand Romans at first used papyrus, but later they employed the more lasting\r\nparchment prepared from sheepskin. Paper seems to have been a Chinese\r\ninvention. It was introduced into Europe by the Arabs during the twelfth\r\ncentury of our era.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DISK OF PHAESTUS\r\nFound in 1908 A.D. in the palace at Phaestus, Crete. The disk is of\r\nrefined clay on which the figures were stamped in relief with punches.\r\nBoth sides of the disk are covered with characters. The side seen in the\r\nillustration contains 31 sign groups (123 signs) separated from one\r\nanother by incised lines. The other side contains 30 sign groups (118\r\nsigns). The inscription dates from about 1800 B.C.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PAPYRUS MANUSCRIPT\r\nThe pith of the papyrus, a plant native to the Nile valley, was cut into\r\nslices, which were then pressed together and dried in the sun. Several of\r\nthe paper sheets thus formed were glued together at their edges to form a\r\nroll. From _papyros_ and _byblos_, the two Greek names of this plant, have\r\ncome our own words, \"paper\" and \"Bible.\" The illustration shows a\r\nmanuscript discovered in Egypt in 1890 A.D. It is supposed to be a\r\ntreatise, hitherto lost, on the Athenian constitution by the Greek\r\nphilosopher Aristotle.]\r\n\r\nINSCRIPTIONS AND REMAINS\r\n\r\nA second class of written records consists of inscriptions. These are\r\nusually cut in stone, but sometimes we find them painted over the surface\r\nof a wall, stamped on coins, or impressed upon metal tablets. The\r\nhistorian also makes use of remains, such as statues, ornaments, weapons,\r\ntools, and utensils. Monuments of various sorts, including palaces, tombs,\r\nfortresses, bridges, temples, and churches, form a very important class of\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nBEGINNINGS OF HISTORY\r\n\r\nHistory, based on written records, begins in different countries at\r\nvarying dates. A few manuscripts and inscriptions found in Egypt date back\r\nthree or four thousand years before Christ. The annals of Babylonia are\r\nscarcely less ancient. Trustworthy records in China and India do not\r\nextend beyond 1000 B.C. For the Greeks and Romans the commencement of the\r\nhistoric period must be placed about 750 B.C. The inhabitants of northern\r\nEurope did not come into the light of history until about the opening of\r\nthe Christian era.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. PREHISTORIC PEOPLES\r\n\r\nTHE PREHISTORIC PERIOD\r\n\r\nIn studying the historic period our chief concern is with those peoples\r\nwhose ideas or whose deeds have aided human progress and the spread of\r\ncivilization. Six-sevenths of the earth's inhabitants now belong to\r\ncivilized countries, and these countries include the best and largest\r\nregions of the globe. At the beginning of historic times, however,\r\ncivilization was confined within a narrow area--the river valleys of\r\nwestern Asia and Egypt. The uncounted centuries before the dawn of history\r\nmake up the prehistoric period, when savagery and barbarism prevailed\r\nthroughout the world. Our knowledge of it is derived from the examination\r\nof the objects found in caves, refuse mounds, graves, and other sites.\r\nVarious European countries, including England, France, Denmark,\r\nSwitzerland, and Italy, are particularly rich in prehistoric remains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PREHISTORIC EGYPTIAN GRAVE\r\nThe skeleton lay on the left side, with knees drawn up and hands raised to\r\nthe head. About it were various articles of food and vessels of pottery.]\r\n\r\nTHE TWO AGES\r\n\r\nThe prehistoric period is commonly divided, according to the character of\r\nthe materials used for tools and weapons, into the Age of Stone and the\r\nAge of Metals. The one is the age of savagery; the other is the age of\r\nbarbarism or semicivilization.\r\n\r\nTHE STONE AGE\r\n\r\nMan's earliest implements were those that lay ready to his hand. A branch\r\nfrom a tree served as a spear; a thick stick in his strong arms became a\r\npowerful club. Later, perhaps, came the use of a hard stone such as flint,\r\nwhich could be chipped into the forms of arrowheads, axes, and spear tips.\r\nThe first stone implements were so rude in shape that it is difficult to\r\nbelieve them of human workmanship. They may have been made several hundred\r\nthousand years ago. After countless centuries of slow advance, savages\r\nlearned to fasten wooden handles to their stone tools and weapons and also\r\nto use such materials as jade and granite, which could be ground and\r\npolished into a variety of forms. Stone implements continued to be made\r\nduring the greater part of the prehistoric period. Every region of the\r\nworld has had a Stone Age. [1] Its length is reckoned, not by centuries,\r\nbut by milleniums.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HATCHET OF THE EARLY STONE AGE\r\nA hatchet of flint, probably used without a helve and intended to fit the\r\nhand. Similar implements have been found all over the world, except in\r\nAustralia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARROWHEADS OF THE LATER STONE AGE\r\nDifferent forms from Europe, Africa, and North America.]\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF METALS\r\n\r\nThe Age of Metals, compared with its predecessor, covers a brief expanse\r\nof time. The use of metals came in not much before the dawn of history.\r\nThe earliest civilized peoples, the Babylonians and Egyptians, when we\r\nfirst become acquainted with them, appear to be passing from the use of\r\nstone implements to those of metal.\r\n\r\nCOPPER\r\n\r\nCopper was the first metal in common use. The credit for the invention of\r\ncopper tools seems to belong to the Egyptians. At a very early date they\r\nwere working the copper mines on the peninsula of Sinai. The Babylonians\r\nprobably obtained their copper from the same region. Another source of\r\nthis metal was the island of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean. The\r\nGreek name of the island means \"copper.\"\r\n\r\nBRONZE\r\n\r\nBut copper tools were soft and would not keep an edge. Some ancient smith,\r\nmore ingenious than his fellows, discovered that the addition of a small\r\npart of tin to the copper produced a new metal--bronze--harder than the\r\nold, yet capable of being molded into a variety of forms. At least as\r\nearly as 3000 B.C. we find bronze taking the place of copper in both Egypt\r\nand Babylonia. Somewhat later bronze was introduced into the island of\r\nCrete, then along the eastern coast of Greece, and afterwards into other\r\nEuropean countries.\r\n\r\nIRON\r\n\r\nThe introduction of iron occurred in comparatively recent times. At first\r\nit was a scarce, and therefore a very precious, metal. The Egyptians seem\r\nto have made little use of iron before 1500 B.C. They called it \"the metal\r\nof heaven,\" as if they obtained it from meteorites. In the Greek Homeric\r\npoems, composed about 900 B.C. or later, we find iron considered so\r\nvaluable that a lump of it is one of the chief prizes at athletic games.\r\nIn the first five books of the Bible iron is mentioned only thirteen\r\ntimes, though copper and bronze are referred to forty-four times. Iron is\r\nmore difficult to work than either copper or bronze, but it is vastly\r\nsuperior to those metals in hardness and durability. Hence it gradually\r\ndisplaced them throughout the greater part of the Old World. [2]\r\n\r\nFIRST STEPS TOWARD CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nDuring the prehistoric period early man came to be widely scattered\r\nthroughout the world. Here and there, slowly, and with utmost difficulty,\r\nhe began to take the first steps toward civilization. The tools and\r\nweapons which he left behind him afford some evidence of his advance. We\r\nmay now single out some of his other great achievements and follow their\r\ndevelopment to the dawn of history.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. DOMESTICATION OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS\r\n\r\nHUNTING AND FISHING STAGE\r\n\r\nPrehistoric man lived at first chiefly on wild berries, nuts, roots, and\r\nherbs. As his implements improved and his skill increased, he became\r\nhunter, trapper, and fisher. A tribe of hunters, however, requires an\r\nextensive territory and a constant supply of game. When the wild animals\r\nare all killed or seriously reduced in number, privation and hardship\r\nresult. It was a forward step, therefore, when man began to tame animals\r\nas well as to kill them.\r\n\r\nDOMESTICATION OF THE DOG\r\n\r\nThe dog was man's first conquest over the animal kingdom. As early as the\r\nAge of Metals various breeds appear, such as deerhounds, sheep dogs, and\r\nmastiffs. The dog soon showed how useful he could be. He tracked game,\r\nguarded the camp, and later, in the pastoral stage, protected flocks and\r\nherds against their enemies.\r\n\r\nTHE COW\r\n\r\nThe cow also was domesticated at a remote period. No other animal has been\r\nmore useful to mankind. The cow's flesh and milk supply food: the skin\r\nprovides clothing; the sinews, bones, and horns yield materials for\r\nimplements. The ox was early trained to bear the yoke and draw the plow,\r\nas we may learn from ancient Egyptian paintings. [3] Cattle have also been\r\ncommonly used as a kind of money. The early Greeks, whose wealth consisted\r\nchiefly of their herds, priced a slave at twenty oxen, a suit of armor at\r\none hundred oxen, and so on. The early Romans reckoned values in cattle\r\n(one ox being equivalent to ten sheep). Our English word \"pecuniary\" goes\r\nback to the Latin _pecus_, or \"herd\" of cattle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY ROMAN BAR MONEY\r\nA bar of copper marked with the figure of a bull. Dates from the fourth\r\ncentury B.C.]\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE\r\n\r\nThe domestication of the horse came much later than that of the cow. In\r\nthe early Stone Age the horse ran wild over western Europe and formed an\r\nimportant source of food for primitive men. This prehistoric horse, as\r\nsome ancient drawings show, [4] was a small animal with a shaggy mane and\r\ntail. It resembled the wild pony still found on the steppes of Mongolia.\r\nThe domesticated horse does not appear in Egypt and western Asia much\r\nbefore 1500 B.C. For a long time after the horse was tamed, the more\r\nmanageable ox continued to be used as the beast of burden. The horse was\r\nkept for chariots of war, as among the Egyptians, or ridden bareback in\r\nraces, as by the early Greeks.\r\n\r\nOTHER ANIMALS DOMESTICATED\r\n\r\nAt the close of prehistoric times in the Old World nearly all the domestic\r\nanimals of to-day were known. Besides those just mentioned, the goat,\r\nsheep, ass, and hog had become man's useful servants. [5]\r\n\r\nPASTORAL STAGE\r\n\r\nThe domestication of animals made possible an advance from the hunting and\r\nfishing stage to the pastoral stage. Herds of cattle and sheep would now\r\nfurnish more certain and abundant supplies of food than the chase could\r\never yield. We find in some parts of the world, as on the great Asiatic\r\nplains, the herdsman succeeding the hunter and fisher. But even in this\r\nstage much land for grazing is required. With the exhaustion of the\r\npasturage the sheep or cattle must be driven to new fields. Hence pastoral\r\npeoples, as well as hunting and fishing folk, remained nomads without\r\nfixed homes. Before permanent settlements were possible, another onward\r\nstep became necessary. This was the domestication of plants.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL STAGE\r\n\r\nThe domestication of plants marked almost as wonderful an advance as the\r\ndomestication of animals. When wild seedgrasses and plants had been\r\ntransformed into the great cereals--wheat, oats, barley, and rice--people\r\ncould raise them for food, and so could pass from the life of wandering\r\nhunters or shepherds to the life of settled farmers. There is evidence\r\nthat during the Stone Age some of the inhabitants of Europe were familiar\r\nwith various cultivated plants, but agriculture on a large scale seems to\r\nhave begun in the fertile regions of Egypt and western Asia. [6] Here\r\nfirst arose populous communities with leisure to develop the arts of life.\r\nHere, as has been already seen, [7] we must look for the beginnings of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. WRITING AND THE ALPHABET\r\n\r\nPICTURE WRITING\r\n\r\nThough history is always based on written records, the first steps toward\r\nwriting are prehistoric. We start with the pictures or rough drawings\r\nwhich have been found among the remains of the early Stone Age. [8]\r\nPrimitive man, however, could not rest satisfied with portraying objects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VARIOUS SIGNS OF SYMBOLIC PICTURE WRITING\r\n1, \"war\" (Dakota Indian); 2, \"morning\" (Ojibwa Indian); 3, \"nothing\"\r\n(Ojibwa Indian); 4 and 5, \"to eat\" (Indian, Mexican, Egyptian, etc.).]\r\n\r\nHe wanted to record thoughts and actions, and so his pictures tended to\r\nbecome symbols of ideas. The figure of an arrow might be made to\r\nrepresent, not a real object, but the idea of an \"enemy.\" A \"fight\" could\r\nthen be shown simply by drawing two arrows directed against each other.\r\nMany uncivilized tribes still employ picture writing of this sort. The\r\nAmerican Indians developed it in most elaborate fashion. On rolls of birch\r\nbark or the skins of animals they wrote messages, hunting stories, and\r\nsongs, and even preserved tribal annals extending over a century.\r\n\r\nSOUND WRITING; THE REBUS\r\n\r\nA new stage in the development of writing was reached when the picture\r\nrepresented, not an actual object or an idea, but a sound of the human\r\nvoice. This difficult but all-important step appears to have been taken\r\nthrough the use of the rebus, that is, writing words by pictures of\r\nobjects which stand for sounds. Such rebuses are found in prehistoric\r\nEgyptian writing; for example, the Egyptian words for \"sun\" and \"goose\"\r\nwere so nearly alike that the royal title, \"Son of the Sun,\" could be\r\nsuggested by grouping the pictures of the sun and a goose. Rebus making is\r\nstill a common game among children, but to primitive men it must have been\r\na serious occupation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEXICAN REBUS\r\nThe Latin _Pater Noster,_ \"Our Father,\" is written by a flag _(pan)_, a\r\nstone _(te)_, a prickly pear _(noch)_, and another stone _(te)_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINESE PICTURE WRITING AND LATER CONVENTIONAL CHARACTERS]\r\n\r\nWORDS AND SYLLABLES\r\n\r\nIn the simplest form of sound writing each separate picture or symbol\r\nstands for the sound of an entire word. This method was employed by the\r\nChinese, who have never given it up. A more developed form of sound\r\nwriting occurs when signs are used for the sounds, not of entire words,\r\nbut of separate syllables. Since the number of different syllables which\r\nthe voice can utter is limited, it now becomes possible to write all the\r\nwords of a language with a few hundred signs. The Japanese, who borrowed\r\nsome of the Chinese symbols, used them to denote syllables, instead of\r\nentire words. The Babylonians possessed, in their cuneiform [9]\r\ncharacters, signs for about five hundred syllables. The prehistoric\r\ninhabitants of Crete appear to have been acquainted with a somewhat\r\nsimilar system. [10]\r\n\r\nLETTERS\r\n\r\nThe final step in the development of writing is taken when the separate\r\nsounds of the voice are analyzed and each is represented by a single sign\r\nor letter. With alphabets of a few score letters every word in a language\r\nmay easily be written.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRETAN WRITING\r\nA large tablet with linear script found in the palace at Gnossus, Crete\r\nThere are eight lines of writing, with a total of about twenty words\r\nNotice the upright lines, which appear to mark the termination of each\r\ngroup of signs.]\r\n\r\nEGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians early developed such an alphabet. Unfortunately they never\r\ngave up their older methods of writing and learned to rely upon alphabetic\r\nsigns alone. Egyptian hieroglyphics [11] are a curious jumble of object-\r\npictures, symbols of ideas, and signs for entire words, separate\r\nsyllables, and letters. The writing is a museum of all the steps in the\r\ndevelopment from the picture to the letter.\r\n\r\nPHOENICIAN ALPHABET\r\n\r\nAs early, apparently, as the tenth century B.C. we find the Phoenicians of\r\nwestern Asia in possession of an alphabet. It consisted of twenty-two\r\nletters, each representing a consonant. The Phoenicians do not seem to\r\nhave invented their alphabetic signs. It is generally believed that they\r\nborrowed them from the Egyptians, but recent discoveries in Crete perhaps\r\npoint to that island as the source of the Phoenician alphabet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EGYPTIAN AND BABYLONIAN WRITING\r\nBelow the pictured hieroglyphics in the first line is the same text in a\r\nsimpler writing known as hieratic. The two systems, however, were not\r\ndistinct; they were as identical as our own printed and written\r\ncharacters. The third line illustrates old Babylonian cuneiform, in which\r\nthe characters, like the hieroglyphics, are rude and broken-down pictures\r\nof objects. Derived from them is the later cuneiform shown in lines four\r\nand five.]\r\n\r\nDIFFUSION OF THE PHOENICIAN ALPHABET\r\n\r\nIf they did not originate the alphabet now in use, the Phoenicians did\r\nmost to spread a knowledge of it in other lands. They were bold sailors\r\nand traders who bought and sold throughout the Mediterranean. Wherever\r\nthey went, they took their alphabet. From the Phoenicians the Greeks\r\nlearned their letters. Then the Greeks taught them to the Romans, from\r\nwhom other European peoples borrowed them. [12]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MOABITE STONE, (Louvre, Paris)\r\nFound in 1868 A.D. at Diban east of the Dead Sea. The monument records the\r\nvictory of Mesha king of Moab, over the united armies of Israel and Judah\r\nabout 850 B.C. The inscription, consisting of 34 lines is one of the most\r\nancient examples of Phoenician writing.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. PRIMITIVE SCIENCE AND ART\r\n\r\nFOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that prehistoric men in their struggle for existence\r\nhad gathered an extensive fund of information. They could make useful and\r\nartistic implements of stone. They could work many metals into a variety\r\nof tools and weapons. They were practical botanists, able to distinguish\r\ndifferent plants and to cultivate them for food. They were close students\r\nof animal life and expert hunters and fishers. They knew how to produce\r\nfire and preserve it, how to cook, how to fashion pottery and baskets, how\r\nto spin and weave, how to build boats and houses. After writing came into\r\ngeneral use, all this knowledge served as the foundation of science.\r\n\r\nCOUNTING AND MEASURING\r\n\r\nWe can still distinguish some of the first steps in scientific knowledge.\r\nThus, counting began with calculations on one's fingers, a method still\r\nfamiliar to children. Finger counting explains the origin of the decimal\r\nsystem. The simplest, and probably the earliest, measures of length are\r\nthose based on various parts of the body. Some of our Indian tribes, for\r\ninstance, employed the double arm's length, the single arm's length, the\r\nhand width, and the finger width. Old English standards, such as the span,\r\nthe ell, and the hand, go back to this very obvious method of measuring on\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nCALCULATION OF TIME; THE CALENDAR\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to trace the beginnings of time reckoning and of that\r\nmost important institution, the calendar. Most primitive tribes reckon\r\ntime by the lunar month, the interval between two new moons (about twenty-\r\nnine days, twelve hours). Twelve lunar months give us the lunar year of\r\nabout three hundred and fifty-four days. In order to adapt such a year to\r\nthe different seasons, the practice arose of inserting a thirteenth month\r\nfrom time to time. Such awkward calendars were used in antiquity by the\r\nBabylonians, Jews, and Greeks; in modern times by the Arabs and Chinese.\r\nThe Egyptians were the only people in the Old World to frame a solar year.\r\nFrom the Egyptians it has come down, through the Romans, to us. [13]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STONEHENGE\r\nOn Salisbury Plain in the south of England: appears to date from the close\r\nof the New Stone Age or the beginning of the Bronze Age. The outer circle\r\nmeasures 300 feet in circumference; the inner circle, 106 feet. The\r\ntallest stones reach 25 feet in height. This monument was probably a tomb,\r\nor group of tombs, of prehistoric chieftains.]\r\n\r\nEARLY DRAWING AND PAINTING\r\n\r\nThe study of prehistoric art takes us back to the early Stone Age. The men\r\nof that age in western Europe lived among animals such as the mammoth,\r\ncave bear, and woolly-haired rhinoceros, which have since disappeared, and\r\namong many others, such as the lion and hippopotamus, which now exist only\r\nin warmer climates. Armed with clubs, flint axes, and horn daggers,\r\nprimitive hunters killed these fierce beasts and on fragments of their\r\nbones, or on cavern walls, drew pictures of them. Some of these earliest\r\nworks of art are remarkably lifelike.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD OF A GIRL (Musée S. Germain, Paris)\r\nA small head of a young girl carved from mammoth ivory. Found at\r\nBrassempouy, France, in cave deposits belonging to the early Stone Age.\r\nThe hair is arranged somewhat after the early Egyptian fashion. Of the\r\nfeatures the mouth alone is wanting.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREHISTORIC ART\r\n  SKETCH OF MAMMOTH ON A TUSK FOUND IN A CAVE IN FRANCE\r\n  CAVE BEAR DRAWN ON A PEBBLE\r\n  BISON PAINTED ON THE WALL OF A CAVE\r\n  WILD HORSE ON THE WALL OF A CAVE IN SPAIN.\r\n\r\n    Later he pictured an aurochs--later he pictured a bear--\r\n    Pictured the sabre toothed tiger dragging a man to his lair--\r\n    Pictured the mountainous mammoth hairy abhorrent alone--\r\n    Out of the love that he bore them scribing them clearly on bone--\r\n      KIPLING.]\r\n\r\nEARLY ARCHITECTURE\r\n\r\nA still later period of the Stone Age witnessed the beginnings of\r\narchitecture. Men had begun to raise huge dolmens which are found in\r\nvarious parts of the Old World from England to India. They also erected\r\nenormous stone pillars, known as menhirs. Carved in the semblance of a\r\nhuman face and figure, the menhir became a statue, perhaps the first ever\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nAs we approach historic times, we note a steady improvement in the various\r\nforms of art. Recent discoveries in Egypt, Greece, Italy, and other lands\r\nindicate that their early inhabitants were able architects, often building\r\non a colossal scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DOLMEN\r\nDepartment of Morbihan, Brittany. A dolmen was a single chambered tomb\r\nformed by laying one long stone over several other stones set upright in\r\nthe ground. Most if not all dolmens were originally covered with earth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARVED MENHIR\r\nFrom Saint Sernin in Aveyron, a department of southern France.]\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE OF PREHISTORIC ART\r\n\r\nTheir paintings and sculptures prepared the way for the work of later\r\nartists. Our survey of the origins of art shows us that in this field, as\r\nelsewhere, we must start with the things accomplished by prehistoric men.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. HISTORIC PEOPLES\r\n\r\nRACES OF MAN\r\n\r\nAt the dawn of history the various regions of the world were already in\r\nthe possession of many different peoples. Such physical characteristics as\r\nthe shape of the skull, the features, stature, or complexion may serve to\r\ndistinguish one people from another. Other grounds for distinction are\r\nfound in language, customs beliefs, and general intelligence.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF RACES\r\n\r\nIf we take complexion or color as the basis of classification, it is\r\npossible to distinguish a few large racial groups. Each of these groups\r\noccupies, roughly speaking, its separate area of the globe. The most\r\nfamiliar classification is that which recognizes the Black or Negro race\r\ndwelling in Africa, the Yellow or Mongolian race whose home is in central\r\nand eastern Asia, and the White or Caucasian race of western Asia and\r\nEurope. Sometimes two additional divisions are made by including, as the\r\nRed race, the American Indians, and as the Brown race, the natives of the\r\nPacific islands.\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE RACE\r\n\r\nThese separate racial groups have made very unequal progress in culture.\r\nThe peoples belonging to the Black, Red, and Brown races are still either\r\nsavages or barbarians, as were the men of prehistoric times. The Chinese\r\nand Japanese are the only representatives of the Yellow race that have\r\nbeen able to form civilized states. In the present, as in the past, it is\r\nchiefly the members of the White race who are developing civilization and\r\nmaking history.\r\n\r\nINDO-EUROPEANS AND SEMITES\r\n\r\nBecause of differences in language, scholars have divided the White or\r\nCaucasian race into two main groups, called Indo-Europeans and Semites.\r\n[14] This classification is often helpful, but the student should remember\r\nthat Indo-European and Semitic peoples are not always to be sharply\r\ndistinguished because they have different types of language. There is no\r\nvery clear distinction in physical characteristics between the two groups.\r\nA clear skin, an oval face, wavy or curly hair, and regular features\r\nseparate them from both the Negro and the Mongolian.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL INDO-EUROPEAN PEOPLES\r\n\r\nThe Indo-Europeans in antiquity included the Hindus of India, the Medes\r\nand Persians dwelling on the plateau of Iran, the Greeks and Italians, and\r\nmost of the inhabitants of central and western Europe. All these peoples\r\nspoke related languages which are believed to be offshoots from one common\r\ntongue. Likeness in language does not imply that all Indo-Europeans were\r\nclosely related in blood. Men often adopt a foreign tongue and pass it on\r\nto their children.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL SEMITIC PEOPLES\r\n\r\nThe various Semitic nations dwelling in western Asia and Arabia were more\r\nclosely connected with one another. They spoke much the same type of\r\nlanguage, and in physical traits and habits of life they appear to have\r\nbeen akin. The Semites in antiquity included the Babylonians and\r\nAssyrians, the Hebrews, Phoenicians, and Arabs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RACE PORTRAITURE OF THE EGYPTIANS\r\nPaintings on the walls of royal tombs. The Egyptians were painted red, the\r\nSemites yellow, the Negroes black, and the Libyans white, with blue eyes\r\nand fair beards. Each racial type is distinguished by peculiar dress and\r\ncharacteristic features.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map. Distribution of SEMITIC and INDO-EUROPEAN PEOPLES]\r\nPEOPLES OF UNCERTAIN RELATIONSHIP\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the historic period still other parts of the World were\r\nthe homes of various peoples who cannot be classed with certainty as\r\neither Indo-Europeans or Semites. Among these were the Egyptians and some\r\nof the inhabitants of Asia Minor. We must remember that, during the long\r\nprehistoric ages, repeated conquests and migrations mingled the blood of\r\nmany different communities. History, in fact, deals with no unmixed\r\npeoples.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1. On an outline map indicate the areas occupied in antiquity by Semites\r\nand Indo-Europeans.\r\n\r\n2.

Why has the invention of the bow-and-arrow been of greater importance\r\nthan the invention of gunpowder?\r\n\r\n10. How does the presence of few tameable animals in the New World help to\r\naccount for its tardier development as compared with the Old World?\r\n\r\n11.

Give examples of peoples widely different in blood who nevertheless\r\nspeak the same language.\r\n\r\n13. In the classification of mankind, where do the Arabs belong? the\r\nPersians? the Germans? the inhabitants of the United States?\r\n\r\n14. Enumerate the most important contributions to civilization made in\r\nprehistoric times.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] There are still some savage peoples, for instance, the Australians,\r\nwho continue to make stone implements very similar to those of prehistoric\r\nmen. Other primitive peoples, such as the natives of the Pacific islands,\r\npassed directly from the use of stone to that of iron, after this part of\r\nthe world was opened up to European trade in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n[2] Iron was unknown to the inhabitants of North America and South America\r\nbefore the coming of the Europeans. The natives used many stone\r\nimplements, besides those of copper and bronze. The Indians got most of\r\ntheir copper from the mines in the Lake Superior region, whence it was\r\ncarried far and wide.\r\n\r\n[3] See the illustration, page 45.\r\n\r\n[4] See the illustration, page 14.\r\n\r\n[5] In the New World, the only important domestic animal was the llama of\r\nthe Andes. The natives used it as a beast of burden, ate its flesh, and\r\nclothed themselves with its wool.\r\n\r\n[6] The plants domesticated in the New World were not numerous. The most\r\nimportant were the potato of Peru and Ecuador, Indian corn or maize,\r\ntobacco, the tomato, and manioc. From the roots of the latter, the starch\r\ncalled tapioca is derived.\r\n\r\n[7] See page 2.\r\n\r\n[8] See the illustration, page 14.\r\n\r\n[9] Latin cuneus, \"a wedge\".\r\n\r\n[10] See page 71.\r\n\r\n[11] From the Greek words hieros, \"holy,\" and glyphein, \"to carve\" The\r\nEgyptians regarded their signs as sacred.\r\n\r\n[12] Our word \"alphabet\" comes from the names of the first two letters of\r\nthe Greek alphabet, _alpha_ (a) and _beta_ (b).\r\n\r\n[13] See page 186 and note 2.\r\n\r\n[14] The Old Testament (_Genesis_, x 21-22) represents Shem (or Sem), son\r\nof Noah, as the ancestor of the Semitic peoples. The title \"Indo-\r\nEuropeans\" tells us that the members of that group now dwell in India and\r\nin Europe. Indo-European peoples are popularly called \"Aryans,\" from a\r\nword in Sanskrit (the old Hindu language) meaning \"noble.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE LANDS AND PEOPLES OF THE EAST TO ABOUT 600 B.C. [1]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. PHYSICAL ASIA\r\n\r\nGRAND DIVISIONS OF ASIA\r\n\r\nAncient history begins in the East--in Asia and in that part of Africa\r\ncalled Egypt, which the peoples of antiquity always regarded as belonging\r\nto Asia. If we look at a physical map of Asia, we see at once that it\r\nconsists of two very unequal divisions separated by an almost continuous\r\nmass of mountains and deserts. These two divisions are Farther and Nearer,\r\nor Eastern and Western, Asia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, PHYSICAL MAP OF ASIA.]\r\n\r\nFARTHER ASIA\r\n\r\nFarther Asia begins at the center of the continent with a series of\r\nelevated table-lands which rise into the lofty plateaus, known as the\r\n\"Roof of the World.\" Here two tremendous mountain chains diverge. The\r\nAltai range runs out to the northeast and reaches the shores of the\r\nPacific near Bering Strait. The Himalaya range extends southeast to the\r\nMalay peninsula. In the angle formed by their intersection lies the cold\r\nand barren region of East Turkestan and Tibet, the height of which, in\r\nsome places, is ten thousand feet above the sea. From these mountains and\r\nplateaus the ground sinks gradually toward the north into the lowlands of\r\nWest Turkestan and Siberia, toward the east and south into the plains of\r\nChina and India.\r\n\r\nCHINA\r\n\r\nThe fertile territory of central China, watered by the two streams,\r\nYangtse and Hoangho, was settled at a remote period by barbarous tribes.\r\nThe civilization which they slowly developed in antiquity has endured with\r\nlittle change until the present day. The inhabitants of neighboring\r\ncountries, Korea, Japan, and Indo-China, owe much to this civilization. It\r\nhas exerted slight influence on the other peoples of Asia because the\r\nChinese have always occupied a distant corner of the continent, cut off by\r\ndeserts and mountains from the lands on the west. As if these barriers\r\nwere not enough, they raised the Great Wall to protect their country from\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA\r\nThe wall extends for about fifteen hundred miles along the northern\r\nfrontier of China. In 1908 AD it was traversed for its entire length by an\r\nAmerican Mr. W. E. Geil. He found many parts of the fortification still in\r\ngood repair, though built twenty one centuries ago.]\r\n\r\nBehind this mighty rampart the Chinese have lived secluded and aloof from\r\nthe progress of our western world. In ancient times China was a land of\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nINDIA\r\n\r\nIndia was better known than China, especially its two great rivers, the\r\nIndus and the Ganges, which flow to the southwest and southeast,\r\nrespectively, and make this part of the peninsula one of the most fertile\r\nterritories on the globe. Such a land attracted immigrants. The region now\r\nknown as the Punjab, where the Indus receives the waters of five great\r\nstreams, was settled by light-skinned Indo-Europeans [2] perhaps as early\r\nas 2000 B.C. Then they occupied the valley of the Ganges and so brought\r\nall northern India under their control.\r\n\r\nINDIA AND THE WEST\r\n\r\nIndia did not remain entirely isolated from the rest of Asia, The Punjab\r\nwas twice conquered by invaders from the West; by the Persians in the\r\nsixth century B.C., [3] and about two hundred years later by the Greeks.\r\n[4] After the end of foreign rule India continued to be of importance\r\nthrough its commerce, which introduced such luxuries as precious stones,\r\nspices, and ivory among the western peoples.\r\n\r\nNEARER ASIA\r\n\r\nNearer, or Western Asia, the smaller of the two grand divisions of the\r\nAsiatic continent, is bounded by the Black and Caspian seas on the north,\r\nby the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and Indian Ocean on the south, eastward by\r\nthe Indus River, and westward by the Mediterranean and the Nile. Almost\r\nall the countries within this area played a part in the ancient history of\r\nthe Orient.\r\n\r\nCOUNTRIES OF NEARER ASIA\r\n\r\nThe lofty plateaus of central Asia decline on the west into the lower but\r\nstill elevated region of Iran. The western part of Iran was occupied in\r\nantiquity by the kindred people known as Medes and Persians. Armenia, a\r\nwild and mountainous region, is an extension to the northwest of the\r\nIranian table-land. Beyond Armenia we cross into the peninsula of Asia\r\nMinor, a natural link between Asia and Europe. Southward from Asia Minor\r\nwe pass along the Mediterranean coast through Syria to Arabia. The Arabian\r\npeninsula may be regarded as the link between Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nThese five countries of Nearer Asia were not well fitted to become centers\r\nof early civilization. They possessed no great rivers which help to bring\r\npeople together, and no broad, fertile plains which support a large\r\npopulation. Armenia, Asia Minor, and Syria were broken up into small\r\ndistricts by chains of mountains. Iran and Arabia were chiefly barren\r\ndeserts. But two other divisions of Nearer Asia resembled distant India\r\nand China in the possession of a warm climate, a fruitful soil, and an\r\nextensive river system. These lands were Babylonia and Egypt, the first\r\nhomes of civilized man.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. BABYLONIA AND EGYPT\r\n\r\nTHE TIGRIS AND THE EUPHRATES\r\n\r\nTwo famous rivers rise in the remote fastnesses of Armenia--the Tigris and\r\nthe Euphrates. As they flow southward, the twin streams approach each\r\nother to form a common valley, and then proceed in parallel channels for\r\nthe greater part of their course. In antiquity each river emptied into the\r\nPersian Gulf by a separate mouth. This Tigris-Euphrates valley was called\r\nby the Greeks Mesopotamia, \"the land between the rivers.\"\r\n\r\nPRODUCTIONS OF BABYLONIA\r\n\r\nBabylonia is a remarkably productive country. The annual inundation of the\r\nrivers has covered its once rocky bottom with deposits of rich silt. Crops\r\nplanted in such a soil, under the influence of a blazing sun, ripen with\r\ngreat rapidity and yield abundant harvests. \"Of all the countries that we\r\nknow,\" says an old Greek traveler, \"there is no other so fruitful in\r\ngrain.\" [5] Wheat and barley were perhaps first domesticated in this part\r\nof the world. [6] Wheat still grows wild there. Though Babylonia possessed\r\nno forests, it had the date palm, which needed scarcely any cultivation.\r\nIf the alluvial soil yielded little stone, clay, on the other hand, was\r\neverywhere. Molded into brick and afterwards dried in the sun, the clay\r\nbecame _adobe_, the cheapest building material imaginable.\r\n\r\nBABYLONIA AN EARLY CENTER OF CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nIn Babylonia Nature seems to have done her utmost to make it easy for\r\nPeople to gain a living. We can understand, therefore, why from\r\nprehistoric times men have been attracted to this region, and why it is\r\nhere that we must look for one of the earliest seats of civilization. [7]\r\n\r\nLOWER AND UPPER EGYPT\r\n\r\nEgypt may be described as the valley of the Nile. Rising in the Nyanza\r\nlakes of central Africa, that mighty stream, before entering Egypt,\r\nreceives the waters of the Blue Nile near the modern town of Khartum. From\r\nthis point the course of the river is broken by a series of five rocky\r\nrapids, misnamed cataracts, which can be shot by boats. The cataracts\r\ncease near the island of Philae, and Upper Egypt begins. This is a strip\r\nof fertile territory, about five hundred miles in length but averaging\r\nonly eight miles in width. Not far from modern Cairo the hills inclosing\r\nthe valley fall away, the Nile divides into numerous branches, and Lower\r\nEgypt, or the Delta, begins. The sluggish stream passes through a region\r\nof mingled swamp and plain, and at length by three principal mouths\r\nempties its waters into the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILAE\r\nThe island was originally only a heap of granite bowlders. Retaining walls\r\nwere built around it, and the space within when filled with rich Nile mud,\r\nbecame beautiful with groves of palms and mimosas. As the result of the\r\nconstruction of the Assuan dam, Philae and its exquisite temples are now\r\nsubmerged during the winter months, when the reservoir is full.]\r\n\r\nEGYPT THE GIFT OF THE NILE\r\n\r\nEgypt owes her existence to the Nile. All Lower Egypt is a creation of the\r\nriver by the gradual accumulation of sediment at its mouths. Upper Egypt\r\nhas been dug out of the desert sand and underlying rock by a process of\r\nerosion centuries long. Once the Nile filled all the space between the\r\nhills that line its sides. Now it flows through a thick layer of alluvial\r\nmud deposited by the yearly inundation.\r\n\r\nANNUAL INUNDATION OF THE NILE\r\n\r\nThe Nile begins to rise in June, when the snow melts on the Abyssinian\r\nmountains. High-water mark, some thirty feet above the ordinary level, is\r\nreached in September. The inhabitants then make haste to cut the confining\r\ndikes and to spread the fertilizing water over their fields. Egypt takes\r\non the appearance of a turbid lake, dotted here and there with island\r\nvillages and crossed in every direction by highways elevated above the\r\nflood. Late in October the river begins to subside and by December has\r\nreturned to its normal level. As the water recedes, it deposits that\r\ndressing of fertile vegetable mold which makes the soil of Egypt perhaps\r\nthe richest in the world. [8]\r\n\r\nEGYPT AN EARLY CENTER OF CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nIt was by no accident that Egypt, like Babylonia, became one of the first\r\nhomes of civilized men. Here, as there, every condition made it easy for\r\npeople to live and thrive. Food was cheap, for it was easily produced. The\r\npeasant needed only to spread his seed broadcast over the muddy fields to\r\nbe sure of an abundant return. The warm, dry climate enabled him to get\r\nalong with little shelter and clothing. Hence the inhabitants of this\r\nfavored region rapidly increased in number and gathered in populous towns\r\nand cities. At a time when most of their neighbors were still in the\r\ndarkness of the prehistoric age, the Egyptians had entered the light of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. THE BABYLONIANS AND THE EGYPTIANS\r\n\r\nINHABITANTS OF BABYLONIA\r\n\r\nThe earliest inhabitants of Babylonia of whom we know anything were a\r\npeople called Sumerians. They entered the Babylonian plain through the\r\npasses of the eastern mountains, three or four thousand years before the\r\nChristian era. Here they formed a number of independent states, each with\r\nits capital city, its patron god, and its king. After them came Semitic\r\ntribes from the deserts of northern Arabia. The Semites mingled with the\r\nSumerians and adopted Sumerian civilization.\r\n\r\nHAMMURABI, KING OF BABYLONIA, ABOUT 2000 B.C.\r\n\r\nOf all the early Babylonian kings the most famous was Hammurabi. Some\r\ninscriptions still remain to tell how he freed his country from foreign\r\ninvaders and made his native Babylon the capital of the entire land. This\r\ncity became henceforth the real center of the Euphrates valley, to which,\r\nindeed, it gave its name. Hammurabi was also an able statesman, who sought\r\nto develop the territories his sword had won. He dug great canals to\r\ndistribute the waters of the Euphrates and built huge granaries to store\r\nthe wheat against a time of famine. In Babylon he raised splendid temples\r\nand palaces. For all his kingdom he published a code of laws, the oldest\r\nin the world. [9] Thus Hammurabi, by making Babylonia so strong and\r\nflourishing, was able to extend her influence in every direction. Her only\r\nimportant rival was Egypt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOP OF MONUMENT CONTAINING THE CODE OF HAMMURABI (British\r\nMuseum, London)\r\nA block of black diorite nearly 8 feet high, on which the code is chiseled\r\nin 44 columns and over 3600 lines. The relief at the top of the monument\r\nshows the Babylonian king receiving the laws from the sun god who is\r\nseated at the right.]\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Egyptians is not known with certainty. In physical\r\ncharacteristics they resembled the native tribes of northern and\r\ninhabitants eastern Africa. Their language, however, shows of Egypt close\r\nkinship to the Semitic tongues of western Asia and Arabia. It is probable\r\nthat the Egyptians, like the Babylonians, arose from the mingling of\r\nseveral peoples.\r\n\r\nMENES, KING OF EGYPT, ABOUT 3400 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe history of Egypt commences with the union of the two kingdoms of Upper\r\nand Lower Egypt under Menes. An ancient tradition made him the builder of\r\nMemphis, near the head of the Delta, and the founder of the Egyptian\r\nmonarchy. Scholars once doubted these exploits and even regarded Menes\r\nhimself as mythical. Recently, however, his tomb has been discovered. In\r\nthe gray dawn of history Menes appears as a real personage, the first of\r\nthat line of kings, or \"Pharaohs,\" who for nearly three thousand years\r\nruled over Egypt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, EGYPTIAN EMPIRE About 1450 B.C.]\r\n\r\nTHE PYRAMID KINGS, ABOUT 3000-2500 B.C.\r\n\r\nSeveral centuries after Menes we reach the age of the kings who raised the\r\npyramids. Probably no other rulers have ever stamped their memory so\r\nindelibly on the pages of history as the builders of these mighty\r\nstructures. The most celebrated monarch of this line was the Pharaoh whom\r\nthe Greeks called Cheops. The Great Pyramid near Memphis, erected for his\r\ntomb, remains a lasting witness to his power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO FAMOUS PHARAOHS\r\n  Khufu (Cheops) builder of the Great Pyramid\r\n  Menephtah the supposed Pharaoh of the Exodus]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT PYRAMID\r\nThe pyramid when completed had a height of 481 feet. It is now 451 feet\r\nhigh. Its base covers about thirteen acres. Some of the blocks of white\r\nlimestone used in construction weigh fifty tons. The facing of polished\r\nstone was gradually removed for building purposes by the Arabs. On the\r\nnorthern side of the pyramid a narrow entrance once carefully concealed,\r\nopens into tortuous passages which lead to the central vault. Here the\r\nsarcophagus of the king was placed. This chamber was long since entered\r\nand its contents rifled.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT SPHINX\r\nThis colossal figure, human headed and lion bodied, is hewn from the\r\nnatural rock. The body is about 150 feet long, the paws 50 feet, the head\r\n30 feet. The height from the base to the top of the head is 70 feet.\r\nExcept for its head and shoulders the figure has been buried for centuries\r\nin the desert sand. The eyes, nose and beard have been mutilated by the\r\nArabs. The face is probably that of one of the pyramid kings.]\r\n\r\nAFTER THE PYRAMID KINGS\r\n\r\nFor a long time after the epoch of the pyramid kings the annals of Egypt\r\nfurnish a record of quiet and peaceful progress. The old city of Memphis\r\ngradually declined in importance and Thebes in Upper Egypt became the\r\ncapital. The vigorous civilization growing up in Egypt was destined,\r\nhowever, to suffer a sudden eclipse. About 1800 B.C. barbarous tribes from\r\nwestern Asia burst into the country, through the isthmus of Suez, and\r\nsettled in the Delta. The Hyksos, as they are usually called, extended\r\ntheir sway over all Egypt. At first they ruled harshly, plundering the\r\ncities and enslaving the inhabitants, but in course of time the invaders\r\nadopted Egyptian culture and their kings reigned like native Pharaohs. The\r\nHyksos are said to have introduced the horse and military chariot into\r\nEgypt. A successful revolt at length expelled the intruders and set a new\r\nline of Theban monarchs on the throne.\r\n\r\nTHE EGYPTIAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of the Hyksos marked a new era in the history of Egypt. From\r\na home-loving and peaceful people the Egyptians became a warlike race,\r\nambitious for glory. The Pharaohs raised powerful armies and by extensive\r\nconquests created an Egyptian Empire, reaching from the Nile to the\r\nEuphrates.\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL SPLENDOR OF EGYPT\r\n\r\nThis period of the imperial greatness of Egypt is the most splendid in its\r\nhistory. An extensive trade with Cyprus, Crete, and other Mediterranean\r\nIslands introduced many foreign luxuries. The conquered territories in\r\nSyria paid a heavy tribute of the precious metals, merchandise, and\r\nslaves. The forced labor of thousands of war captives enabled the Pharaohs\r\nto build public works in every part on their realm. Even the ruins of\r\nthese stupendous structures are enough to indicate the majesty and power\r\nof ancient Egypt.\r\n\r\nRAMESES II, ABOUT 1292-1225 B.C.\r\n\r\nOf all the conquering Pharaohs none won more fame than Rameses II, who\r\nruled for nearly seventy years. His campaigns in Syria were mainly against\r\nthe Hittites, a warlike people who had moved southward from their home in\r\nAsia Minor and sought to establish themselves in the Syrian lands. Rameses\r\ndoes not appear to have been entirely successful against his foes. We find\r\nhim at length entering into an alliance with \"the great king of the\r\nHittites,\" by which their dominion over northern Syria was recognized. In\r\nthe arts of peace Rameses achieved a more enduring renown. He erected many\r\nstatues and temples in various parts of Egypt and made Thebes, his\r\ncapital, the most magnificent city of the age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD OF MUMMY OF RAMESES II (Museum of Gizeh)\r\nThe mummy was discovered in 1881 AD in an underground chamber near the\r\nsite of Thebes. With it were the coffins and bodies of more than a score\r\nof royal personages. Rameses II was over ninety years of age at the time\r\nof his death. In spite of the somewhat grotesque disguise of\r\nmummification, the face of this famous Pharaoh still wears an aspect of\r\nmajesty and pride.]\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF THE EGYPTIAN POWER\r\n\r\nRameses II was the last of the great Pharaohs. After his death the empire\r\nsteadily declined in strength. The Asiatic possessions fell away, never to\r\nbe recovered. By 1100 B.C. Egypt had been restricted to her former\r\nboundaries in the Nile valley. The Persians, in the sixth century, brought\r\nthe country within their own vast empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. THE PHOENICIANS AND THE HEBREWS\r\n\r\nTHE PHOENICIANS\r\n\r\nThe Phoenicians were the first Syrian people to assume importance. Their\r\ncountry was a narrow stretch of coast, about one hundred and twenty miles\r\nin length, seldom more than twelve miles in width, between the Lebanon\r\nMountains and the sea. This tiny land could not support a large\r\npopulation. As the Phoenicians increased in numbers, they were obliged to\r\nbetake themselves to the sea. The Lebanon cedars furnished soft, white\r\nwood for shipbuilding, and the deeply indented coast offered excellent\r\nharbors. Thus the Phoenicians became preeminently a race of sailors. Their\r\ngreat cities, Sidon and Tyre, established colonies throughout the\r\nMediterranean and had an extensive commerce with every region of the known\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nTHE HEBREWS\r\n\r\nThe Hebrews lived south of Phoenicia in the land of Canaan, west of the\r\nJordan River Their history begins with the emigration of twelve Hebrew\r\ntribes (called Israelites) from northern Arabia to Canaan. In their new\r\nhome the Israelites gave up the life of wandering shepherds and became\r\nfarmers. They learned from the Canaanites to till the soil and to dwell in\r\ntowns and cities.\r\n\r\nPERIOD OF THE JUDGES\r\n\r\nThe thorough conquest of Canaan proved to be no easy task. At first the\r\ntwelve Israelitish tribes formed only a loose and weak confederacy without\r\na common head. \"In those days there was no king in Israel, every man did\r\nwhat was right in his own eyes.\" [10] The sole authority was that held by\r\nvaliant chieftains and law-givers, such as Samson, Gideon, and Samuel, who\r\nserved as judges between the tribes and often led them in successful\r\nattacks upon their foes. Among these were the warlike Philistines, who\r\noccupied the southwestern coast of Canaan. To resist the Philistines with\r\nsuccess it was necessary to have a king who could bring all the scattered\r\ntribes under his firm, well-ordered rule.\r\n\r\nREIGNS OF SAUL AND DAVID\r\n\r\nIn Saul, \"a young man and a goodly,\" the warriors of Israel found a leader\r\nto unite them against their enemies. His reign was passed in constant\r\nstruggles with the Philistines. David, who followed him, utterly destroyed\r\nthe Philistine power and by further conquests extended the boundaries of\r\nthe new state. For a capital city he selected the ancient fortress of\r\nJerusalem. Here David built himself a royal palace and here he fixed the\r\nArk, the sanctuary of Jehovah. Jerusalem became to the Israelites their\r\ndearest possession and the center of their national life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, CANAAN as Divided among THE TRIBES]\r\n\r\nREIGN OF SOLOMON, ABOUT 955-925 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Solomon, the son and successor of David, was the most\r\nsplendid period in Hebrew history. His kingdom stretched from the Red Sea\r\nand the peninsula of Sinai northward to the Lebanon Mountains and the\r\nEuphrates. With the surrounding peoples Solomon was on terms of friendship\r\nand alliance. He married an Egyptian princess, a daughter of the reigning\r\nPharaoh. He joined with Hiram, king of Tyre, in trading expeditions on the\r\nRed Sea and Indian Ocean. The same Phoenician monarch supplied him with\r\nthe \"cedars of Lebanon,\" with which he erected at Jerusalem a famous\r\ntemple for the worship of Jehovah. A great builder, a wise administrator\r\nand governor, Solomon takes his place as a typical Oriental despot, the\r\nmost powerful monarch of the age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PHOENICIAN WAR GALLEY\r\nFrom a slab found at Nineveh in the palace of the Assyrian king,\r\nSennacherib. The vessel shown is a bireme with two decks. On the upper\r\ndeck are soldiers with their shields hanging over the side. The oarsmen\r\nsit on the lower deck, eight at each side. The crab catching the fish is a\r\nhumorous touch.]\r\n\r\nSECESSION OF THE TEN TRIBES, ABOUT 925 B.C.\r\n\r\nBut the political greatness of the Hebrews was not destined to endure. The\r\npeople were not ready to bear the burdens of empire. They objected to the\r\nstanding army, to the forced labor on public buildings, and especially to\r\nthe heavy taxes. The ten northern tribes seceded shortly after Solomon's\r\ndeath and established the independent kingdom of Israel, with its capital\r\nat Samaria. The two southern tribes, Judah and Benjamin, formed the\r\nkingdom of Judea, and remained loyal to the successors of Solomon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, SOLOMON'S KINGDOM]\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF THE HEBREW POWER\r\n\r\nThe two small Hebrew kingdoms could not resist their powerful neighbors.\r\nAbout two centuries after the secession of the Ten Tribes, the Assyrians\r\noverran Israel. Judea was subsequently conquered by the Babylonians. Both\r\ncountries in the end became a part of the Persian Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. THE ASSYRIANS\r\n\r\nGREATNESS OF ASSYRIA, 745-626 B.C.\r\n\r\nAssyria, lying east of the Tigris River, was colonized at an early date by\r\nemigrants from Babylonia. After the Assyrians freed themselves from\r\nBabylonian control, they entered upon a series of sweeping conquests.\r\nEvery Asiatic state felt their heavy hand. The Assyrian kings created a\r\nhuge empire stretching from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf, the\r\nMediterranean, and the Nile. For the first time in Oriental history\r\nMesopotamia and Egypt, with the intervening territory, were brought under\r\none government.\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF ASSYRIAN RULE\r\n\r\nThis unification of the Orient was accomplished only at a fearful cost.\r\nThe records of Assyria are full of terrible deeds--of towns and cities\r\nwithout number given to the flames, of the devastation of fertile fields\r\nand orchards, of the slaughter of men, women, and children, of the\r\nenslavement of entire nations. Assyrian monarchs, in numerous\r\ninscriptions, boast of the wreck and ruin they brought to many flourishing\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ASSYRIAN\r\nFrom a Nineveh bas-relief. The original is colored.]\r\n\r\nSARGON II, 722-705 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of conquered peoples by the Assyrian rulers is well\r\nillustrated by their dealings with the Hebrews. One of the mightiest\r\nmonarchs was an usurper, who ascended the throne as Sargon II. Shortly\r\nafter his succession he turned his attention to the kingdom of Israel,\r\nwhich had revolted. Sargon in punishment took its capital city of Samaria\r\n(722 B.C.) and led away many thousands of the leading citizens into a\r\nlifelong captivity in distant Assyria. The Ten Tribes mingled with the\r\npopulation of that region and henceforth disappeared from history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT ORIENTAL EMPIRES\r\n  Map, THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE about 660 B.C.\r\n  Map, LYDIA, MEDIA, BABYLONIA and EGYPT about 550 B.C.]\r\n\r\nSENNACHERIB, 705-681 B.C.\r\n\r\nSargon's son, Sennacherib, though not the greatest, is the best known of\r\nAssyrian kings. His name is familiar from the many references to him in\r\nOld Testament writings. An inscription by Sennacherib describes an\r\nexpedition against Hezekiah, king of Judea, who was shut up \"like a caged\r\nbird in his royal city of Jerusalem.\" Sennacherib, however, did not\r\ncapture the place. His troops were swept away by a pestilence. The ancient\r\nHebrew writer conceives it as the visitation of a destroying angel: \"It\r\ncame to pass that night that the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in\r\nthe camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand; and when\r\nmen arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.\" [11]\r\nSo Sennacherib departed, and returned with a shattered army to Nineveh,\r\nhis capital.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ASSYRIAN RELIEF (British Museum, London)\r\nThe relief represents the siege and capture of Lachish, a city of the\r\nCanaanites, by Sennacherib's troops. Notice the total absence of\r\nperspective in this work.]\r\n\r\nDOWNFALL OF ASSYRIA, 606 B.C.\r\n\r\nAlthough Assyria recovered from this disaster, its empire rested on\r\nunstable foundations. The subject races were attached to their oppressive\r\nmasters by no ties save those of force. When Assyria grew exhausted by its\r\ncareer of conquest, they were quick to strike a blow for freedom. By the\r\nmiddle of the seventh century Egypt had secured her independence, and many\r\nother provinces were ready to revolt. Meanwhile, beyond the eastern\r\nmountains, the Medes were gathering ominously on the Assyrian frontier.\r\nThe storm broke when the Median monarch, in alliance with the king of\r\nBabylon, moved upon Nineveh and captured it. The city was utterly\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ISHTAR GATE, BABYLON\r\nExplorations on the site of Babylon have been conducted since 1899 A.D. by\r\nthe German Oriental Society. Large parts of the temple area, as well as\r\nsections of the royal palaces, have been uncovered. The most important\r\nstructure found is the Ishtar Gate. The towers which flank it are adorned\r\nwith figures of dragons and bulls in brilliantly colored glazed tile.]\r\n\r\nPARTITION OF ASSYRIA\r\n\r\nAfter the conquest of the Assyrian Empire the victors proceeded to divide\r\nthe spoils. The share of Media was Assyria itself, together with the long\r\nstretch of mountain country extending from the Persian Gulf to Asia Minor.\r\nBabylonia obtained the western half of the Assyrian domains, including the\r\nEuphrates valley and Syria. Under its famous king, Nebuchadnezzar (604-561\r\nB.C.), Babylonia became a great power in the Orient. It was Nebuchadnezzar\r\nwho brought the kingdom of Judea to an end. He captured Jerusalem in 586\r\nB.C., burned the Temple, and carried away many Jews into captivity. The\r\nday of their deliverance, when Babylon itself should bow to a foreign foe,\r\nwas still far distant.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. THE WORLD EMPIRE OF PERSIA\r\n\r\nCYRUS THE GREAT, 553-529 B.C.\r\n\r\nNot much earlier than the break-up of the Assyrian Empire, we find a new\r\nand vigorous people pressing into western Iran. They were the Persians,\r\nnear kinsmen of the Medes. Subjects at first of Assyria, and then of\r\nMedia, they regained their independence and secured imperial power under a\r\nconquering king whom history knows as Cyrus the Great. In 553 B.C. Cyrus\r\nrevolted against the Median monarch and three years later captured the\r\nroyal city of Ecbatana. The Medes and Persians formed henceforth a united\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOMB OF CYRUS THE GREAT\r\nThe mausoleum is built of immense marble blocks joined together without\r\ncement. Its total height including the seven steps is about thirty five\r\nfeet. A solitary pillar near the tomb still bears the inscription 'I am\r\nCyrus, the King, the Achaemenian.']\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF LYDIA BY CYRUS, 546 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Media was soon followed by a war with the Lydians, who had\r\nbeen allies of the Medes. The throne of Lydia, a state in the western part\r\nof Asia Minor, was at this time held by Croesus, the last and most famous\r\nof his line. The king grew so wealthy from the tribute paid by Lydian\r\nsubjects and from his gold mines that his name has passed into the\r\nproverb, \"rich as Croesus.\" He viewed with alarm the rising power of Cyrus\r\nand rashly offered battle to the Persian monarch. Defeated in the open\r\nfield, Croesus shut himself up in Sardis, his capital. The city was soon\r\ntaken, however, and with its capture the Lydian kingdom came to an end.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF BABYLON, 539 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe downfall of Lydia prepared the way for a Persian attack on Babylonia.\r\nThe conquest of that country proved unexpectedly easy. In 539 B.C. the\r\ngreat city of Babylon opened its gates to the Persian host. Shortly\r\nafterwards Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jewish exiles there to\r\nreturn to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple, which Nebuchadnezzar had\r\ndestroyed. With the surrender of Babylon the last Semitic empire in the\r\nEast came to an end. The Medes and Persians, an Indo-European people,\r\nhenceforth ruled over a wider realm than ever before had been formed in\r\nOriental lands.\r\n\r\nCAMBYSES, 529-522 B.C.\r\n\r\nCyrus was followed by his son, Cambyses, a cruel but stronghanded despot.\r\nCambyses determined to add Egypt to the Persian dominions. His land army\r\nwas supported by a powerful fleet, to which the Phoenicians and the Greeks\r\nof Cyprus contributed ships. A single battle sufficed to overthrow the\r\nEgyptian power and to bring the long rule of the Pharaohs to a close. [12]\r\n\r\nDARIUS THE GREAT, 521-485 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Darius, the successor of Cambyses, was marked by further\r\nextensions of the frontiers. An expedition to the distant East added to\r\nthe empire the region of the Punjab, [13] along the upper waters of the\r\nIndus. Another expedition against the wild Scythian tribes along the\r\nDanube led to conquests in Europe and brought the Persian dominions close\r\nto those of the Greeks. Not without reason could Darius describe himself\r\nin an inscription which still survives, as \"the great king, king of kings,\r\nking of countries, king of all men.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DARIUS WITH HIS ATTENDANTS\r\nBas-relief at Persepolis. The monarch's right hand grasps a staff or\r\nscepter, his left hand, a bunch of flowers. His head is surmounted by a\r\ncrown, his body is enveloped in the long Median mantle. Above the king is\r\na representation of the divinity which guarded and guided him.

They\r\nare near Persepolis.]\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\nIt was the work of Darius to provide for his dominions a stable government\r\nwhich should preserve what the sword had won. The problem was difficult.\r\nThe empire was a collection of many peoples widely different in race,\r\nlanguage, customs, and religion. Darius did not attempt to weld the\r\nconquered nations into unity. As long as the subjects of Persia paid\r\ntribute and furnished troops for the royal army, they were allowed to\r\nconduct their own affairs with little interference from the Great King.\r\n\r\nTHE SATRAPAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThe entire empire, excluding Persia proper, was divided into twenty\r\nsatrapies, or provinces, each one with its civil governor, or satrap. The\r\nsatraps carried out the laws and collected the heavy tribute annually\r\nlevied throughout the empire. In most of the provinces there were also\r\nmilitary governors who commanded the army and reported directly to the\r\nking. This device of intrusting the civil and military functions to\r\nseparate officials lessened the danger of revolts against the Persian\r\nauthority. As an additional precaution Darius provided special agents\r\nwhose business it was to travel from province to province and investigate\r\nthe conduct of his officials. It became a proverb that \"the king has many\r\neyes and many ears.\"\r\n\r\nPERSIAN ROADS\r\n\r\nDarius also established a system of military roads throughout the Persian\r\ndominions. The roads were provided at frequent intervals with inns, where\r\npostmen stood always in readiness to take up a letter and carry it to the\r\nnext station. The Royal Road from Susa, the Persian capital, to Sardis in\r\nLydia was over fifteen hundred miles long; but government couriers, using\r\nrelays of fresh horses, could cover the distance within a week. An old\r\nGreek writer declares with admiration that \"there is nothing mortal more\r\nswift than these messengers.\" [14]\r\n\r\nUNION OF THE EAST UNDER PERSIA\r\n\r\nThe political history of the East fitly ends with the three Persian\r\nconquerors, Cyrus, Cambyses, and Darius, who thus brought into their huge\r\nempire every great state of Oriental antiquity. Medes and Persians,\r\nBabylonians and Assyrians, Lydians, Syrians, and Egyptians--all were at\r\nlength united under a single dominion. In the reign of Darius this united\r\nOrient first comes into contact with the rising power of the Greek states\r\nof Europe. So we may leave its history here, resuming our narrative when\r\nwe discuss the momentous conflict between Persia and Greece, which was to\r\naffect the course, not alone of Persian or Greek, but of all European\r\nhistory.

SOCIAL CLASSES\r\n\r\nREDISCOVERY OF THE ORIENT\r\n\r\nOur present knowledge of the Orient has been gained within recent times.\r\nLess than a century ago no one could read the written records of the\r\nEgyptians and Babylonians. The decipherment of the Rosetta Stone, which\r\ncontained an inscription in both Greek and hieroglyphics, led to the\r\nunderstanding of Egyptian writing. Scholars later succeeded in\r\ninterpreting the Babylonian cuneiform script. Modern excavations in the\r\nvalleys of the Nile and the Euphrates have now provided them with abundant\r\nmaterial for study in the shape of books and inscriptions. As these are\r\ngradually deciphered, new light is being thrown on all features of ancient\r\nOriental civilization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ROYAL NAME IN HIEROGLYPHICS (ROSETTA STONE)\r\nThe cut shows the symbols contained in one of the oval rings, or\r\n_cartouches_, for Ptolemaios, the Greek name of King Ptolemy. Each symbol\r\nrepresents the initial letter of the Egyptian name for the object\r\npictured. The objects in order are: a mat, a half-circle, a noose, a lion,\r\na hole, two reeds, and a chair-back. The entire hieroglyph is read from\r\nleft to right, as we read words in English.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROSETTA STONE.\r\nBritish Museum, London. A block of black basalt, three feet seven inches\r\nin height, found in 1799 A.D., near the Rosetta mouth of the Nile.]\r\n\r\nTHE KING AS AUTOCRAT\r\n\r\nThe Oriental peoples, when their history opens, were living under the\r\nmonarchical form of government. The king, to his subjects, was the earthly\r\nrepresentative of the god. Often, indeed, he was himself regarded as\r\ndivine. The belief in the king's divine origin made obedience to him a\r\nreligious obligation for his subjects. Every Oriental monarch was an\r\nautocrat. Every Oriental monarchy was a despotism.\r\n\r\nTHE KING'S DUTIES\r\n\r\nThe king had many duties. He was judge, commander, and high priest, all in\r\none. In time of war, he led his troops and faced the dangers of the battle\r\nfield. During intervals of peace, he was occupied with a constant round of\r\nsacrifices, prayers, and processions, which could not be neglected without\r\nexciting the anger of the gods. To his courtiers he gave frequent\r\naudience, hearing complaints, settling disputes, and issuing commands. A\r\nconscientious monarch, such as Hammurabi, who describes himself as \"a real\r\nfather to his people,\" must have been a very busy man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EGYPTIAN COURT SCENE\r\nWall painting from a tomb at Thebes. Shows a Pharaoh receiving Asiatic\r\nenvoys bearing tribute. They are introduced by white robed Egyptian\r\nofficials. The Asiatics may be distinguished by their gay clothes and\r\nblack, sharp pointed beards.]\r\n\r\nNOBLES AND PRIESTS\r\n\r\nBesides the monarch and the royal family there was generally in Oriental\r\ncountries an upper class of landowners. In Egypt the Pharaoh was regarded\r\nas sole owner of the land. Some of it he worked through his slaves, but\r\nthe larger part he granted to his favorites, as hereditary estates. Such\r\npersons may be called the nobles. The different priesthoods also had much\r\nland, the revenues from which kept up the temples where they ministered.\r\nIn Babylonia, likewise, we find a priesthood and nobility supported by the\r\nincome from landed property.\r\n\r\nTHE MIDDLE CLASS\r\n\r\nThe middle class included professional men, shopkeepers independent\r\nfarmers, and skilled craftsmen. Though regarded as inferiors, still they\r\nhad a chance to rise in the world. If they became rich, they might hope to\r\nenter the upper class as priests or government officials.\r\n\r\nWORKMEN AND PEASANTS\r\n\r\nNo such hopes encouraged the day laborer in the fields or shops. His lot\r\nwas bitter poverty and a life of unending toil. If he was an unskilled\r\nworkman, his wages were only enough to keep him and his family. He toiled\r\nunder overseers who carried sticks and used them freely. \"Man has a back,\"\r\nsays an Egyptian proverb, \"and only obeys when it is beaten.\" If the\r\nlaborer was a peasant, he could be sure that the nobles from whom he\r\nrented the land and the tax collectors of the king would leave him\r\nscarcely more than a bare living.\r\n\r\nSLAVES\r\n\r\nAt the very bottom of the social ladder were the slaves. Every ancient\r\npeople possessed them. At first they were prisoners of war, who, instead\r\nof being slaughtered, were made to labor for their masters. At a later\r\nperiod people unable to pay their debts often became slaves. The treatment\r\nof slaves depended on the character of the master. A cruel and overbearing\r\nowner might make life a burden for his bondmen. Escape was rarely\r\npossible. Slaves were branded like cattle to prevent their running away.\r\nHammurabi's code [2] imposed the death penalty on anybody who aided or\r\nconcealed the fugitives. There was plenty of work for the slaves to\r\nperform--repairing dikes, digging irrigation canals, and erecting vast\r\npalaces and temples. The servile class in Egypt was not as numerous as in\r\nBabylonia, and slavery itself seems to have assumed there a somewhat\r\nmilder form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRANSPORT OF AN ASSYRIAN COLOSSUS\r\nA slab from a gallery of Sennacherib's palace at Nineveh. The immense\r\nblock is being pulled forward by slaves, who work under the lash.]\r\n\r\n\r\n14. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nFARMING\r\n\r\nSuch fruitful, well-watered valleys as those of the Nile and the Euphrates\r\nencouraged agricultural life. Farming was the chief occupation. Working\r\npeople, whether slaves or freemen, were generally cultivators of the soil.\r\nAll the methods of agriculture are pictured for us on the monuments. We\r\nmark the peasant as he breaks up the earth with a hoe or plows a shallow\r\nfurrow with a sharp-pointed stick. We see the sheep being driven across\r\nsown fields to trample the seed into the moist soil. We watch the patient\r\nlaborers as with hand sickles they gather in the harvest and then with\r\nheavy flails separate the chaff from the grain. Although their methods\r\nwere very clumsy, ancient farmers raised immense crops of wheat and\r\nbarley. The soil of Egypt and Babylonia not only supported a dense\r\npopulation, but also supplied food for neighboring peoples. These two\r\nlands were the granaries of the East.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLOWING AND SOWING IN ANCIENT EGYPT]\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURING\r\n\r\nMany industries of to-day were known in ancient Egypt and Babylonia. There\r\nwere blacksmiths, carpenters, stonecutters, workers in ivory, silver, and\r\ngold, weavers, potters, and glass blowers. The creations of these ancient\r\ncraftsmen often exhibit remarkable skill. Egyptian linens were so\r\nwonderfully fine and transparent as to merit the name of \"woven air.\"\r\nBabylonian tapestries, carpets, and rugs enjoyed a high reputation for\r\nbeauty of design and color. Egyptian glass with its waving lines of\r\ndifferent hues was much prized. Precious stones were made into beads,\r\nnecklaces, charms, and seals. The precious metals were employed for a\r\ngreat variety of ornaments. Egyptian paintings show the goldsmiths at work\r\nwith blowpipe and forceps, fashioning bracelets, rings, and diadems,\r\ninlaying objects of stone and wood, or covering their surfaces with fine\r\ngold leaf. The manufacture of tiles and glazed pottery was everywhere\r\ncarried on. Babylonia is believed to be the original home of porcelain.\r\nEnameled bricks found there are unsurpassed by the best products of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nTRADE\r\n\r\nThe development of the arts and crafts brought a new industrial class into\r\nexistence. There was now need of merchants and shopkeepers to collect\r\nmanufactured products where they could be readily bought and sold. The\r\ncities of Babylonia, in particular, became thriving markets. Partnerships\r\nbetween tradesmen were numerous. We even hear of commercial companies.\r\nBusiness life in ancient Babylonia wore, indeed, quite a modern look.\r\n\r\nMONEY\r\n\r\nMetallic money first circulated in the form of rings and bars. The\r\nEgyptians had small pieces of gold--\"cow gold\"--each of which was simply\r\nthe value of a full-grown cow. [3] It was necessary to weigh the metal\r\nwhenever a purchase took place. A common picture on the Egyptian monuments\r\nis that of the weigher with his balance and scales. Then the practice\r\narose of stamping each piece of money with its true value and weight. The\r\nnext step was coinage proper, where the government guarantees, not only\r\nthe weight, but also the genuineness of the metal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EGYPTIAN WEIGHING \"COW GOLD\"]\r\n\r\nCOINAGE\r\n\r\nThe honor of the invention of coinage is generally given to the Lydians,\r\nwhose country was well supplied with the precious metals. As early as the\r\neighth century B.C. the Lydian monarchs began to strike coins of electrum,\r\na natural alloy of gold and silver. The famous Croesus,[4] whose name is\r\nstill a synonym for riches, was the first to issue coins of pure gold and\r\nsilver. The Greek neighbors of Lydia quickly adopted the art of coinage\r\nand so introduced it into Europe. [5]\r\n\r\nBANKING\r\n\r\nThe use of money as a medium of exchange led naturally to a system of\r\nbanking. In Babylonia, for instance, the bankers formed an important and\r\ninfluential class. One great banking house, established at Babylon before\r\nthe age of Sennacherib, carried on operations for several centuries.\r\nHundreds of legal documents belonging to this firm have been discovered in\r\nthe huge earthenware jars which served as safes. The Babylonian temples\r\nalso received money on deposit and loaned it out again, as do our modern\r\nbanks. Knowledge of the principles of banking passed from Babylonia to\r\nGreece and thence to ancient Italy and Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. COMMERCE AND TRADE ROUTES\r\n\r\nASIATIC COMMERCE\r\n\r\nThe use of the precious metals as money greatly aided the exchange of\r\ncommodities between different countries. The cities of the Tigris-\r\nEuphrates valley were admirably situated for commerce, both by sea and\r\nland. They enjoyed a central position between eastern and western Asia.\r\nThe shortest way by water from India skirted the southern coast of Iran\r\nand, passing up the Persian Gulf, gained the valley of the two great\r\nrivers. Even more important were the overland roads from China and India\r\nwhich met at Babylon and Nineveh. Along these routes traveled long lines\r\nof caravans laden with the products of the distant East--gold and ivory,\r\njewels and silks, tapestries, spices, and fine woods. Still other avenues\r\nof commerce radiated to the west and entered Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt.\r\nMany of these trade routes are in use even to-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, ANCIENT TRADE ROUTES]\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE WITH EUROPE\r\n\r\nWhile the inhabitants of Babylonia and Assyria were able to control the\r\ncaravan routes of Asia, it was reserved for a Syrian people, the\r\nPhoenicians, to become the pioneers of commerce with Europe. As early as\r\n1500 B.C. the rich copper mines of Cyprus attracted Phoenician colonists\r\nto this island. [6] From Cyprus these bold mariners and keen business men\r\npassed to Crete, thence along the shores of Asia Minor to the Greek\r\nmainland, and possibly to the Black Sea. Some centuries later the\r\nPhoenicians were driven from these regions by the rising power of the\r\nGreek states. Then they sailed farther westward and established their\r\ntrading posts in Sicily, Africa, and Spain. At length they passed through\r\nthe strait of Gibraltar into the Atlantic and visited the shores of\r\nwestern Europe and Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, PHOENICIAN AND GREEK COLONIES]\r\n\r\nPHOENICIAN IMPORTS AND EXPORTS\r\n\r\nThe Phoenicians obtained a great variety of products from their widely\r\nscattered settlements. The mines of Spain yielded tin, lead, and silver.\r\nThe tin was especially valuable because of its use in the manufacture of\r\nbronze. [7] From Africa came ivory, ostrich feathers, and gold; from\r\nArabia, incense, perfumes, and costly spices. The Phoenicians found a\r\nready sale for these commodities throughout the East. Still other products\r\nwere brought directly to Phoenicia to provide the raw materials for her\r\nflourishing manufactures. The fine carpets and glassware, the artistic\r\nworks in silver and bronze, and the beautiful purple cloths [8] produced\r\nby Phoenician factories were exported to every region of the known world.\r\n\r\nPHOENICIAN VOYAGES OF EXPLORATION\r\n\r\nThe Phoenicians were the boldest sailors of antiquity. Some of their long\r\nvoyages are still on record. We learn from the Bible that they made\r\ncruises on the Red Sea and Indian Ocean and brought the gold of Ophir--\r\n\"four hundred and twenty talents\"--to Solomon. [9] There is even a story\r\nof certain Phoenicians who, by direction of an Egyptian king, explored the\r\neastern coast of Africa, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and after three\r\nyears' absence returned to Egypt through the strait of Gibraltar. A much\r\nmore probable narrative is that of the voyage of Hanno, a Carthaginian\r\nadmiral. We still possess a Greek translation of his interesting log book.\r\nIt describes an expedition made about 500 B.C. along the western coast of\r\nAfrica. The explorers seem to have sailed as far as the country now called\r\nSierra Leone. Nearly two thousand years elapsed before a similar voyage\r\nalong the African coast was undertaken.\r\n\r\nPHOENICIAN SETTLEMENTS\r\n\r\nWherever the Phoenicians journeyed, they established settlements. Most of\r\nthese were merely trading posts which contained the warehouses for the\r\nstorage of their goods. Here the shy natives came to barter their raw\r\nmaterials for the finished products--cloths, tools, weapons, wine, and\r\noil--which the strangers from the East had brought with them. Phoenician\r\nsettlements sometimes grew to be large and flourishing cities. The colony\r\nof Gades in southern Spain, mentioned in the Old Testament as Tarshish,\r\n[10] survives to this day as Cadiz. The city of Carthage, founded in North\r\nAfrica by colonists from Tyre, became the commercial mistress of the\r\nMediterranean. Carthaginian history has many points of contact with that\r\nof the Greeks and Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. LAW AND MORALITY\r\n\r\nBABYLONIAN CONTRACTS\r\n\r\nIt is clear that societies so highly organized as Phoenicia, Egypt, and\r\nBabylonia must have been held together by the firm bonds of law. The\r\nancient Babylonians, especially, were a legal-minded people. When a man\r\nsold his wheat, bought a slave, married a wife, or made a will, the\r\ntransaction was duly noted on a contract tablet, which was then filed away\r\nin the public archives. Instead of writing his name, a Babylonian stamped\r\nhis seal on the wet clay of the tablet. Every man who owned property had\r\nto have a seal.\r\n\r\nCODE OF HAMMURABI\r\n\r\nThe earliest laws were, of course, unwritten. They were no more than the\r\nlong-established customs of the community. As civilization advanced, the\r\nusages that generally prevailed were written out and made into legal\r\ncodes. A recent discovery has given to us the almost complete text of the\r\nlaws which Hammurabi, the Babylonian king, ordered to be engraved on stone\r\nmonuments and set up in all the chief cities of his realm. [11]\r\n\r\nSUBJECT MATTER OF HAMMURABI'S CODE\r\n\r\nThe code of Hammurabi shows, in general, a high sense of justice. A man\r\nwho tries to bribe a witness or a judge is to be severely punished. A\r\nfarmer who is careless with his dikes and allows the water to run through\r\nflood his neighbor's land must restore the value of the grain he has\r\ndamaged. The owner of a vicious ox which has gored a man must pay a heavy\r\nfine, provided he knew the disposition of the animal and had not blunted\r\nits horns. A builder who puts up a shaky house which afterwards collapses\r\nand kills the tenant is himself to be put to death. On the other hand, the\r\ncode has some rude features. Punishments were severe. For injuries to the\r\nbody there was the simple rule of retaliation: an eye for an eye, a tooth\r\nfor a tooth, a limb for a limb. A son who had struck his father was to\r\nhave his hands cut off. The nature of the punishment depended, moreover,\r\non the rank of the aggrieved party. A person who had caused the loss of a\r\n\"gentleman's\" eye was to have his own plucked out; but if the injury was\r\ndone to a poor man, the culprit had only to pay a fine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BABYLONIAN CONTRACT TABLET\r\nThe actual tablet is on the right, on the left is a hollow clay case or\r\nenvelope.]\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF HAMMURABI'S CODE\r\n\r\nHammurabi's laws thus present a vivid picture of Oriental society two\r\nthousand years before Christ. They always remained the basis of the\r\nBabylonian and Assyrian legal system. They were destined, also, to exert\r\nconsiderable influence upon Hebrew legislation. Centuries after Hammurabi\r\nthe enactments of the old Babylonian king were reproduced in some of the\r\nfamiliar regulations of the laws of Moses. In this way they became the\r\nheritage of the Hebrews and, through them, of our modern world.\r\n\r\nTHE MOSAIC CODE\r\n\r\nThe laws which we find in the earlier books of the Bible were ascribed by\r\nthe Hebrews to Moses. These laws covered a wide range of topics. They\r\nfixed all religious ceremonies, required the observance every seventh day\r\nof the Sabbath, dealt with marriage and the family, stated the penalties\r\nfor wrongdoing, gave elaborate rules for sacrifices, and even indicated\r\nwhat foods must be avoided as \"unclean.\" No other ancient people possessed\r\nso elaborate a code. The Jews throughout the world obey, to this day, its\r\nprecepts. And modern Christendom still recites the Ten Commandments, the\r\nnoblest summary of the rules of right living that has come down to us from\r\nthe ancient world.\r\n\r\n\r\n17. RELIGION\r\n\r\nNATURE WORSHIP\r\n\r\nOriental ideas of religion, even more than of law and morality, were the\r\ngradual outgrowth of beliefs held by the Asiatic peoples in prehistoric\r\ntimes. Everywhere nature worship prevailed. The vault of heaven, earth and\r\nocean, sun, moon, and stars were all regarded either as themselves divine\r\nor as the abode of divinities. The sun was an object of especial\r\nadoration. We find a sun god, under different names, in every Oriental\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBABYLONIAN BELIEF IN EVIL SPIRITS\r\n\r\nAnother inheritance from prehistoric times was the belief in evil spirits.\r\nIn Babylonia and Assyria this superstition became a prominent feature of\r\nthe popular religion. Men supposed themselves to be constantly surrounded\r\nby a host of demons which caused insanity, sickness, disease, and death--\r\nall the ills of life. People lived in constant fear of offending these\r\nmalignant beings.\r\n\r\nMAGIC\r\n\r\nTo cope with evil spirits the Babylonian used magic. He put up a small\r\nimage of a protecting god at the entrance to his house and wore charms\r\nupon his person. If he felt ill, he went to a priest, who recited a long\r\nincantation supposed to drive out the \"devil\" afflicting the patient. The\r\nreputation of the Babylonian priests was so widespread that in time the\r\nname \"Chaldean\" [12] came to mean one who is a magician. Some of their\r\nmagical rites were borrowed by the Jews, and later by the Romans, from\r\nwhom they entered Christian Europe. Another Babylonian practice which\r\nspread westward was that of divination, particularly by inspecting the\r\nentrails of animals slain in sacrifice. This was a very common method of\r\ndivination among the Greeks and Romans. [13]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EGYPTIAN SCARAB\r\nThe beetle, as a symbol of birth and resurrection, and hence of\r\nimmortality, enjoyed much reverence in ancient Egypt. A scarab, or image\r\nof the beetle, was often worn as a charm and was placed in the mummy as an\r\nartificial heart.]\r\n\r\nASTROLOGY\r\n\r\nAstrology received much attention. It was believed that the five planets,\r\ncomets, and eclipses of the sun and moon exerted an influence for good or\r\nevil on the life of man. Babylonian astrology likewise extended to western\r\nlands and became popular among the Greeks and Romans. Some of it survives\r\nto the present time. When we name the days Saturday, Sunday, and Monday,\r\nwe are unconscious astrologers, for in old belief the first day belonged\r\nto the planet Saturn, the second to the sun, and the third to the moon.\r\n[14] Superstitious people who try to read their fate in the stars are\r\nreally practicing an art of Babylonian origin.\r\n\r\nEGYPTIAN ANIMAL WORSHIP\r\n\r\nLess influential in later times was the animal worship of the Egyptians.\r\nThis, too, formed a heritage from the prehistoric past. Many common\r\nanimals of Egypt--the cat, hawk, the jackal, the bull, the ram, the\r\ncrocodile--were highly reverenced. Some received worship because deities\r\nwere supposed to dwell in them. The larger number, however, were not\r\nworshiped for themselves, but as symbols of different gods.\r\n\r\nMONOTHEISM IN PERSIA\r\n\r\nIn the midst of such an assemblage of nature deities, spirits, and sacred\r\nanimals, it was remarkable that the belief in one god should ever have\r\narisen. The Medes and Persians accepted the teachings of Zoroaster, a\r\ngreat prophet who lived perhaps as early as 1000 B.C. According to\r\nZoroaster, Ahuramazda, the heaven-deity, is the maker and upholder of the\r\nuniverse. He is a god of light and order, of truth and purity. Against him\r\nstands Ahriman, the personification of darkness and evil. Ahuramazda in\r\nthe end will overcome Ahriman and will reign supreme in a righteous world.\r\nZoroastrianism was the only monotheistic religion developed by an Indo-\r\nEuropean people. [15]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMENHOTEP IV\r\nA striking likeness of an Egyptian king (reigned about 1375-1358 B.C.) who\r\nendeavored to introduce monotheism in Egypt by abolishing the worship of\r\nall gods except the sun god. This religious revolution ended in failure\r\nfor after the king's death the old deities were restored to honor.]\r\n\r\nHEBREW MONOTHEISM\r\n\r\nThe Hebrews, alone among the Semitic peoples of antiquity, were to develop\r\nthe worship of their god, Jehovah, into a lasting monotheism. This was a\r\nlong and gradual process Jehovah was at first regarded as the peculiar\r\ndivinity of the Hebrews. His worshipers did not deny the existence of the\r\ngods of other nations. From the eighth century onward this narrow\r\nconception of Jehovah was transformed by the labors of the Hebrew\r\nprophets. They taught that Jehovah was the creator and ruler of the world\r\nand the loving father of all mankind. On Hebrew monotheism two world\r\nreligions have been founded--Mohammedanism and Christianity.\r\n\r\nEGYPTIAN IDEAS OF THE FUTURE LIFE\r\n\r\nWe do not find among the early Hebrews or any other Oriental people very\r\nclear ideas about the life after death. The Egyptians long believed that\r\nthe soul of the dead man resided in or near the tomb, closely associated\r\nwith the body. This notion seems to have first led to the practice of\r\nembalming the corpse, so that it might never suffer decay. If the body was\r\nnot preserved, the soul might die, or it might become a wandering ghost,\r\nrestless and dangerous to the living. Later Egyptian thought regarded the\r\nfuture state as a place of rewards and punishments. One of the chapters of\r\nthe work called the _Book of the Dead_ describes the judgment of the soul\r\nin the spirit world. If a man in the earthly life had not murdered,\r\nstolen, coveted the property of others, blasphemed the gods, borne false\r\nwitness, ill treated his parents, or committed certain other wrongs, his\r\nsoul would enjoy a blissful immortality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUMMY AND COVER OF COFFIN (U.S. National Museum,\r\nWashington)]\r\n\r\nBABYLONIAN AND HEBREW IDEAS OF THE FUTURE LIFE\r\n\r\nSome Oriental peoples kept the primitive belief that after death all men,\r\ngood and bad alike, suffered the same fate. The Babylonians supposed that\r\nthe souls of the departed passed a cheerless existence in a gloomy and\r\nHebrew underworld. The early Hebrew idea of Sheol, \"the land of darkness\r\nand the shadow of death,\" [16] was very similar. Such thoughts of the\r\nfuture life left nothing for either fear or hope. In later times, however,\r\nthe Hebrews came to believe in the resurrection of the dead and the last\r\njudgment, conceptions afterwards adopted by Christianity.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. LITERATURE AND ART\r\n\r\nTHE EGYPTIAN BOOK OF THE DEAD\r\n\r\nReligion inspired the largest part of ancient literature. Each Oriental\r\npeople possessed sacred writings. The Egyptian _Book of the Dead_ was\r\nalready venerable in 3000 B.C. It was a collection of hymns, prayers, and\r\nmagical phrases to be recited by the soul on its journey beyond the grave\r\nand in the spirit world. A chapter from this work usually covered the\r\ninner side of the mummy case.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD\r\nFrom a papyrus containing the _Book of the Dead_. The illustration shows a\r\nman and his wife (at the left) entering the hall in the spirit world,\r\nwhere sits the god of the dead with forty two jurors (seen above) as his\r\nassistants. The heart of the man, symbolized by a jar, is being weighed in\r\nbalances by a jackal-headed god against a feather, the symbol of truth.\r\nThe monster in the right hand corner stands ready to devour the soul, if\r\nthe heart is found lighter than the feather.]\r\n\r\nTHE BABYLONIAN EPICS\r\n\r\nMuch more interesting are the two Babylonian epics, fragments of which\r\nwere found on clay tablets in a royal library at Nineveh. The epic of the\r\nCreation tells how the god Marduk overcame a terrible dragon, the symbol\r\nof primeval chaos, and thus established order in the universe. Then with\r\nhalf the body of the dead dragon he made a covering for the heavens and\r\nset therein the stars. Next he caused the new moon to shine and made it\r\nthe ruler of the night. His last work was the creation of man, in order\r\nthat the service and worship of the gods might be established forever. The\r\nsecond epic contains an account of a flood, sent by the gods to punish\r\nsinful men. The rain fell for six days and nights and covered the entire\r\nearth. All men were drowned except the Babylonian Noah, his family, and\r\nhis relatives, who safely rode the waters in an ark. This ancient\r\nnarrative so closely resembles the Bible story in _Genesis_ that we must\r\ntrace them both to a common source.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DELUGE TABLET (British Museum London)\r\nContains the narrative of the flood as pieced together and published by\r\nGeorge Smith in 1872 A.D. There are sixteen fragments in the restoration.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EGYPTIAN TEMPLE (RESTORED)\r\nThe building extended along the Nile for nearly eight hundred feet. A\r\ndouble line of sphinxes led to the only entrance, in front of which were\r\ntwo obelisks and four colossal statues of Rameses II. Behind the first\r\ngateway, or pylon came an open court surrounded by a portico upheld by\r\npillars. The second and third pylons were connected by a covered passage\r\nleading into another open court. Lower rooms at the rear of the temple\r\ncontained the sanctuary of the god, which only the king and priests could\r\nenter.]\r\n\r\nTHE HEBREW BIBLE\r\n\r\nAll these writings are so ancient that their very authors are forgotten.\r\nThe interest they excite is historical rather than literary. From Oriental\r\nantiquity only one great work has reached us that still has power to move\r\nthe hearts of men--the Hebrew Bible.\r\n\r\nEGYPTIAN ARCHITECTURE\r\n\r\nArchitecture, in Egypt, was the leading art. The Egyptians were the first\r\npeople who learned to raise buildings with vast halls supported by\r\nponderous columns. Their wealth and skill, however, were not lavished in\r\nthe erection of fine private mansions or splendid public buildings. The\r\ncharacteristic works of Egyptian architecture are the tombs of the kings\r\nand the temples of the gods. The picture of the great structure at Thebes,\r\nwhich Rameses II completed, [17] will give some idea of an Egyptian temple\r\nwith its gateways, open courts, obelisks, and statues.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EGYPTIAN WOODEN STATUE, (Museum of Gizeh)\r\nFound in a tomb near Memphis. The statue, which belongs to the age of the\r\npyramid kings, represents a bustling, active, middle-class official.]\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE IN BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA\r\n\r\nThe architecture of Babylonia and Assyria was totally unlike that of\r\nEgypt, because brick, and not stone, formed the chief building and Assyria\r\nmaterial. In Babylonia the temple was a solid, square tower, built on a\r\nbroad platform. It consisted usually of seven stages, which arose one\r\nabove the other to the top, where the shrine of the deity was placed. The\r\ndifferent stages were connected by an inclined ascent. The four sides of\r\nthe temple faced the cardinal points, and the several stages were\r\ndedicated to the sun, moon, and five planets. In Assyria the\r\ncharacteristic building was the palace. But the sun-dried bricks, of which\r\nboth temples and palaces were composed, lacked the durability of stone and\r\nhave long since dissolved into shapeless mounds.\r\n\r\nEGYPTIAN SCULPTURE\r\n\r\nThe surviving examples of Egyptian sculpture consist of bas-reliefs and\r\nfigures in the round, carved from limestone and granite or cast in bronze.\r\nMany of the statues appear to our eyes very stiff and ungraceful. The\r\nsculptor never learned how to pose his figures easily or how to arrange\r\nthem in an artistic group. In spite of these defects some Egyptian statues\r\nare wonderfully lifelike. [18]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ASSYRIAN PALACE (RESTORED)\r\nThe royal residence of Sargon II near Nineveh was placed upon a high\r\nplatform of brick masonry the top of which was gained by stairs and an\r\ninclined roadway. The palace consisted of a series of one storied\r\nrectangular halls and long corridors surrounding inner courts. They were\r\nprovided with imposing entrances flanked by colossal human headed bulls\r\nrepresenting guardian spirits. The entire building covered more than\r\ntwenty three acres and contained two hundred apartments. In the rear is\r\nseen a temple tower.]\r\n\r\nSCULPTURE IN BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA\r\n\r\nFew examples have reached us of Babylonian and Assyrian sculpture in the\r\nround. As in Egypt, the figures seem rigid and out of proportion. The\r\nAssyrian bas-reliefs show a higher development of the artistic sense,\r\nespecially in the rendering of animals. The sculptures that deal with the\r\nexploits of the kings in war and hunting often tell their story in so\r\ngraphic a way as to make up for the absence of written records.\r\n\r\nORIENTAL PAINTING\r\n\r\nPainting in the ancient East did not reach the dignity of an independent\r\nart. It was employed solely for decorative purposes. Bas-reliefs and wall\r\nsurfaces were often brightly colored, The artist had no knowledge of\r\nperspective and drew all his figures in profile, without any distinction\r\nof light and shade. Indeed, Oriental painting, as well as Oriental\r\nsculpture, made small pretense to the beautiful. Beauty was born into the\r\nworld with the art of the Greeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ASSYRIAN WINGED HUMAN HEADED BULL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ASSYRIAN HUNTING SCENE (British Museum, London)\r\nA bas relief from a slab found at Nineveh.]\r\n\r\n\r\n19. SCIENCE AND EDUCATION\r\n\r\nARITHMETIC AND GEOMETRY\r\n\r\nConspicuous advance took place in the exact sciences. The leading\r\noperations of arithmetic were known. A Babylonian tablet gives a table of\r\nsquares and cubes correctly calculated from 1 to 60. The number 12 was the\r\nbasis of all reckonings. The division of the circle into degrees, minutes,\r\nand seconds (360°, 60', 60\") was an invention of the Babylonians which\r\nillustrates this duodecimal system A start was made in geometry. One of\r\nthe oldest of Egyptian books contains a dozen geometrical problems. This\r\nknowledge was afterwards developed into a true science by the Greeks.\r\n\r\nASTRONOMY\r\n\r\nIn both Egypt and Babylonia the cloudless skies and still, warm nights\r\nearly led to astronomical research. At a remote period, perhaps before\r\n4000 B.C., the Egyptians framed a solar calendar, [19] consisting of\r\ntwelve months, each thirty days in length, with five extra days at the end\r\nof the year. This calendar was taken over by the Romans, [20] who added\r\nthe system of leap years. The Babylonians made noteworthy progress in some\r\nbranches of astronomy. They were able to trace the course of the sun\r\nthrough the twelve constellations of the zodiac and to distinguish five of\r\nthe planets from the fixed stars. The successful prediction of eclipses\r\nformed another Babylonian achievement. Such astronomical discoveries must\r\nhave required much patient and accurate observation.\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nGeographical ideas for a long time were very crude. An ancient map,\r\nscratched on clay, indicates that about eight centuries before Christ the\r\nBabylonians had gained some knowledge, not only of their own land, but\r\neven of regions beyond the Mediterranean. The chief increase in man's\r\nknowledge of the world in ancient times was due to the Phoenicians. [21]\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL SCIENCES\r\n\r\nThe skill of Oriental peoples as mechanics and engineers is proved by\r\ntheir success as builders. The great pyramids exactly face the points of\r\nthe compass. The principle of the round arch was known in Babylonia at a\r\nremote period The transportation of colossal stone monuments exhibits a\r\nknowledge of the lever, pulley, and inclined plane. [22] Babylonian\r\ninventions were the sundial and the water clock, the one to register the\r\npassage of the hours by day, the other by night. The Egyptians and\r\nBabylonians also made some progress in the practice of medicine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BABYLONIAN MAP OF THE WORLD\r\nA tablet of dark brown clay, much injured, dating from the 8th or 7th\r\ncentury B.C. The two large concentric circles indicate the ocean or, as it\r\nis called in the cuneiform writing between the circles, the 'Briny Flood.'\r\nBeyond the ocean are seven successive projections of land, represented by\r\ntriangles. Perhaps they refer to the countries existing beyond the Black\r\nSea and the Red Sea. The two parallel lines within the inner circle\r\nrepresent the Euphrates. The little rings stand for the Babylonian cities\r\nin this region.]\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPLE SCHOOL\r\n\r\nThe schools, in both Egypt and Babylonia, were attached to the temples and\r\nwere conducted by the priests. Writing was the chief subject of\r\ninstruction. It took many years of patient study to master the cuneiform\r\nsymbols or the even more difficult hieroglyphics. \"He who would excel in\r\nthe school of the scribes,\" ran an ancient maxim, \"must rise with the\r\ndawn.\" Writing was learned by imitating the examples supplied in copy-\r\nbooks. Some of the model letters studied by Egyptian boys of the twentieth\r\ncentury B.C. have come down to us. Reading, too, was an art not easy to\r\nlearn. Dictionaries and grammars were written to aid the beginner. A\r\nlittle instruction was also provided in counting and calculating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EGYPTIAN SCRIBE (Louvre, Paris)]\r\n\r\nTHE SCRIBES\r\n\r\nHaving learned to read and write, the pupil was ready to enter on the\r\ncoveted career of a scribe. In a community where nearly every one was\r\nilliterate, the scribes naturally held an honorable place. They conducted\r\nthe correspondence of the time. When a man wished to send a letter, he had\r\na scribe write it, signing it himself by affixing his seal. When he\r\nreceived a letter, he usually employed a scribe to read it to him. The\r\nscribes were also kept busy copying books on the papyrus paper or clay\r\ntablets which served as writing materials.\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPLE LIBRARY\r\n\r\nEvery large city of Babylonia possessed a collection of books. Several of\r\nthe larger libraries have been discovered. At Nippur, in Babylonia, thirty\r\nthousand clay tablets were found. Another great collection of books was\r\nunearthed in a royal palace at Nineveh. This Assyrian library seems to\r\nhave been open for the general use of the king's subjects. The Egyptians\r\nalso had their libraries, usually as adjuncts to the temples, and hence\r\nunder priestly control.\r\n\r\nWIDESPREAD POPULAR IGNORANCE\r\n\r\nLearning and education were so closely limited to a few individuals that\r\nthe mass of the people were sunk in deepest ignorance. Men could not\r\npursue knowledge for themselves, but had to accept every thing on\r\nauthority. Hence the inhabitants of Oriental lands remained a conservative\r\nfolk, slow to abandon their time-honored beliefs and very unwilling to\r\nadopt a new custom even when clearly better than the old. This absence of\r\npopular education, more than anything else, made Oriental civilization\r\nunprogressive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXCAVATION AT NIPPUR\r\nNippur was the ancient \"Calneh in the land of Shinar\" (_Genesis_, x, 10)\r\nExcavations here were conducted by the University of Pennsylvania during\r\n1889-1900 A.D.

[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n20. PHYSICAL EUROPE\r\n\r\nEUROPE A PENINSULA OF ASIA\r\n\r\nThe continent of Asia, projecting its huge bulk southwestward between the\r\nseas, gradually narrows into the smaller continent of Europe. The boundary\r\nbetween the two regions is not well defined. Ancient geographers found a\r\nconvenient dividing line north of the Black Sea in the course of the river\r\nDon. Modern map makers usually place the division at the Ural Mountains,\r\nthe Caspian Sea, and the Caucasus. Each of these boundaries is more or\r\nless arbitrary. In a geographical sense Europe is only the largest of the\r\ngreat Asiatic peninsulas.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL FEATURES OF EUROPE\r\n\r\nBut in physical features the two continents disclose the most striking\r\ncontrasts. The sea, which washes only the remote edges of Asia, penetrates\r\ndeeply into Europe and forms an extremely irregular coast line with\r\nnumerous bays and harbors. The mountains of Europe, seldom very high and\r\nprovided with easy passes, present no such barriers to intercourse as the\r\nmightier ranges of Asia. We miss in Europe the extensive deserts and\r\nbarren table-lands which form such a feature of Asiatic geography. With\r\nthe exception of Russia the surface, generally, is distributed into\r\nplains, hills, and valleys of moderate size. Instead of a few large\r\nrivers, such as are found in Asia, Europe is well supplied with numerous\r\nstreams that make it possible to travel readily from one district to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nCENTRAL AND NORTHERN EUROPE\r\n\r\nThe almost unbroken mountain chain formed by the Pyrenees, the Alps, and\r\nthe Balkans, sharply separates the central land mass of Europe from the\r\nregions to the south. Central Europe consists, in general, of lowlands,\r\nwhich widen eastward into the vast Russian plain. Northern Europe includes\r\nthe British Isles, physically an extension of Europe, and the peninsulas\r\nof Scandinavia and Finland, between the Baltic Sea and the Arctic Ocean.\r\nTwenty centuries ago central and northern Europe was a land of forests and\r\nmarshes, of desolate steppes and icebound hills. The peoples who inhabited\r\nit--Celts in the west, Teutons or Germans in the north, Slavs in the east\r\n--were men of Indo-European [2] race and speech. They were still\r\nbarbarians. During ancient times we hear little of them, except as their\r\noccasional migrations southward brought them into contact with the Greeks\r\nand the Romans.\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN EUROPE\r\n\r\nSouthern Europe comprises the three peninsulas of Spain, Italy, and the\r\nBalkans, which reach far south into the Mediterranean. This great inland\r\nsea is divided into two parts near the center, where Africa and the island\r\nof Sicily almost touch each other across a narrow strait. The eastern part\r\ncontains several minor seas, of which the one called the Aegean had most\r\nimportance in Greek history.\r\n\r\n\r\n21. GREECE AND THE AEGEAN\r\n\r\nTHE AEGEAN SEA\r\n\r\nThe Aegean is an almost landlocked body of water. The Balkan peninsula,\r\nnarrowing toward the Mediterranean into the smaller peninsula of Greece,\r\nconfines it on the west. On the east it meets a boundary in Asia Minor.\r\nThe southern boundary is formed by a chain of islands, while the only\r\nopening northward is found in the narrow passage leading to the Black Sea.\r\nThe coasts and islands of the Aegean thus make up a little world set off\r\nby itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, PHYSICAL MAP OF EUROPE]\r\n\r\nCONTINENTAL GREECE\r\n\r\nContinental Greece is a tiny country. Its greatest length is scarcely more\r\nthan two hundred and fifty miles; its greatest breadth is only one hundred\r\nand eighty miles. Mountain ridges, offshoots of the Balkans, compose the\r\ngreater part of its area. Into the valleys and deep gorges of the interior\r\nthe impetuous sea has everywhere forced a channel. The coast line,\r\naccordingly, is most irregular--a constant succession of sharp\r\npromontories and curving bays. The mountains, crossing the peninsula in\r\nconfused masses, break it up into numberless valleys and glens which\r\nseldom widen into plains. The rivers are not navigable. The few lakes,\r\nhemmed in by the hills, have no outlets except in underground channels. In\r\nthis land of the Greeks no place is more than fifty miles from a mountain\r\nrange, or more than forty miles from some long arm of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nTHE AEGEAN ISLANDS\r\n\r\nFrom the Greek mainland to the coast of Asia Minor the traveler follows a\r\nroute thickly studded with rocky islands. They are near enough together to\r\npermit the passage from one to another without losing sight of land. The\r\nAegean islands thus served as \"stepping-stones\" between Greece and Asia\r\nMinor. [3]\r\n\r\nWESTERN ASIA MINOR\r\n\r\nWestern Asia Minor resembles Continental Greece in its deeply indented\r\ncoast, variety of scenery, and mild climate. The fertile river valleys of\r\nthis region early attracted Greek colonists. They built here many\r\nflourishing cities, especially along the central coast, which came to be\r\nknown as Ionia.\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nGreek history well illustrates the influence of geographical conditions on\r\nthe life of a people. In the first place, mountain ranges cut up\r\nContinental Greece into many small states, separated from one another by\r\nnatural ramparts. Hence the Greeks loved most of all their own local\r\nindependence and always refused to unite into one nation under a single\r\ngovernment. In the second place, the near presence of the sea made sailors\r\nof the Greeks and led them to devote much energy to foreign commerce. They\r\nearly felt, in consequence, the stimulating effects of intercourse with\r\nother peoples. Finally, the location of Greece at the threshold of Asia,\r\nwith its best harbors and most numerous islands on the eastern coast,\r\nenabled the country to receive and profit by all the culture of the\r\nOrient. Greece faced the civilized East.\r\n\r\n\r\n22. THE AEGEAN AGE (TO ABOUT 1100 B.C.)\r\n\r\nA PREHISTORIC CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nThe Greeks of historic times knew very little about their prehistoric\r\nperiod. Instead of accurate knowledge they had only the beautiful legends\r\npreserved in ancient poems, such as the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_. Within\r\nour own day, however, remarkable excavations have disclosed the remains of\r\na widespread and flourishing civilization in times so distant that the\r\nhistoric Greeks had lost all sight of it. As in the Orient, [4] the labors\r\nof modern scholars are yearly adding to our knowledge of ancient life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, AEGEAN CIVILIZATION]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXCAVATIONS AT TROY The great northeast tower of the sixth\r\ncity. The stairs at the right belong to the eighth city.]\r\n\r\nSCHLIEMANN'S EXCAVATIONS AT TROY\r\n\r\nThe man who did most to reveal the prehistoric civilization of Greece was\r\na wealthy German merchant named Heinrich Schliemann. An enthusiastic lover\r\nof Homer, he believed that the stories of the Trojan War related in the\r\n_Iliad_ were not idle fancies, but real facts. In 1870 A.D. he started to\r\ntest his beliefs by excavations at a hill called Hissarlik, on the\r\nnorthwestern coast of Asia Minor. Here tradition had always fixed the site\r\nof ancient Troy. Schliemann's discoveries and those of later explorers\r\nproved that at Hissarlik at least nine successive cities had come into\r\nexistence, flourished, and passed away. Excavations completed in 1892 A.D.\r\nhave shown that the sixth city in order from the bottom was the one\r\ndescribed in the Homeric poems. It had powerful walls defended by towers,\r\nwell-fortified gates, and palaces of stone. The marks of fire throughout\r\nthe ruins indicate that the city must have been destroyed by a disastrous\r\nconflagration.\r\n\r\nSCHLIEMANN'S EXCAVATIONS AT MYCENAE AND TIRYNS\r\n\r\nThe remarkable disclosures at Troy encouraged Schliemann to excavate other\r\nHomeric sites. At Mycenae, a prehistoric city of Argolis in Greece, he\r\nlaid bare six rock-hewn graves, containing the skeletons of nineteen\r\npersons, men, women, and children. The faces of the dead had been covered\r\nwith thin masks of gold, and their bodies had been decked with gold\r\ndiadems, bracelets, and pendants. The other funeral offerings include gold\r\nrings, silver vases, and a variety of bronze weapons. At Tiryns, once the\r\ncapital of Argolis, he uncovered the ruins of an extensive structure with\r\ngateways, open courts, and closed apartments. Characteristic of this\r\nedifice were the separate quarters occupied by men and women, the series\r\nof storerooms for provisions, and such a modern convenience as a bathroom\r\nwith pipes and drains. In short, the palace at Tiryns gives us a clear and\r\ndetailed picture of the home of a Homeric prince.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIONS' GATE, MYCENAE\r\nThe stone relief, of triangular shape, represents two lions (or lionesses)\r\nfacing each other on opposite sides of a pillar. The heads of the animals\r\nhave been lost.]\r\n\r\nEVANS'S EXCAVATIONS AT GNOSSUS\r\n\r\nBut the fame of even Schliemann's discoveries has been somewhat dimmed by\r\nthe excavations made since 1900 A.D. on the site of Gnossus, the ancient\r\ncapital of the island of Crete. At Gnossus an Englishman, Sir Arthur\r\nEvans, has found the remains of an enormous palace, with numerous courts,\r\npassages, and rooms. Here is the royal council chamber with the throne on\r\nwhich the king once sat. Here are the royal magazines, still filled with\r\nhuge earthenware jars for the storage of provisions. A great number of\r\nbrilliant pictures--hunting scenes, landscapes, portraits of men and\r\nwomen--cover the palace walls. Buried in some of the chambers were\r\nthousands of clay tablets with inscriptions which, if ever read, will add\r\nnew chapters to ancient history. [5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VAPHIO GOLD CUPS (National Museum, Athens)\r\nThese beautiful objects were found in 1888 within a \"bee-hive\" tomb at\r\nVaphio in Laconia. The two cups are of beaten gold, ornamented with\r\ndesigns in _repoussé_ work. The first scene represents a wild-bull hunt.\r\nThe companion piece pictures four tame bulls under the care of a\r\nherdsman.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILVER FRAGMENT FROM MYCENAE (National Museum, Athens)\r\nA siege scene showing the bows, slings, and huge shields of Mycenaean\r\nwarriors. In the background are seen the masonry of the city wall and the\r\nflat-roofed houses.]\r\n\r\nANTIQUITY OF AEGEAN CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nThese discoveries in the Aegean enable us to place another venerable\r\ncenter of civilized life by the side of Babylonia and Egypt. As early as\r\n3000 B.C. the primitive inhabitants of the Aegean were giving up the use\r\nof stone tools and weapons for those of metal. Bronze soon came into\r\ngeneral use, as is shown by the excavations. The five centuries between\r\n1600 and 1100 B.C. appear to have been the time when the civilization of\r\nthe Aegean Age reached its highest development.\r\n\r\nTHE FINE ARTS\r\n\r\nRemarkable progress took place during Aegean times in some of the fine\r\narts. We find imposing palaces, often splendidly adorned and arranged for\r\na life of comfort. Wall paintings, plaster reliefs, and fine carvings in\r\nstone excite our admiration. Aegean artists made beautiful pottery of many\r\nshapes and cleverly decorated it with plant and animal forms. They carved\r\nivory, engraved gems, and excelled in the working of metals. Some of their\r\nproductions in gold, silver, and bronze were scarcely surpassed by Greek\r\nartists a thousand years later. [6]\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE\r\n\r\nThere was much intercourse throughout the Mediterranean during this\r\nperiod. Products of Aegean art have been found as far west as Sicily,\r\nItaly, and Spain, Aegean pottery has frequently been discovered in\r\nEgyptian tombs. Some objects unearthed in Babylonia are apparently of\r\nAegean workmanship. In those ancient days Crete was mistress of the seas.\r\nCretan merchants preceded the Phoenicians as carriers between Asia and\r\nEurope. [7] Trade and commerce thus opened up the Mediterranean world to\r\nall the cultural influences of the Orient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CRETAN GIRL (Museum of Candia, Crete)\r\nA fresco painting from the palace of Gnossus. The girl's face is so\r\nastonishingly modern in treatment that one can scarcely believe that the\r\npicture belongs to the sixteenth century B.C.]\r\n\r\nDOWNFALL OF AEGEAN CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nAegean civilization did not penetrate beyond the shores of Asia Minor, the\r\nislands, and the coasts of Continental Greece. The interior regions of the\r\nGreek peninsula remained the home of barbarous tribes, which had not yet\r\nlearned to build cities, to create beautiful objects of art, or to traffic\r\non the seas. By 1100 B.C. their destructive inroads brought the Aegean Age\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n23. THE HOMERIC AGE (ABOUT 1100-750 B.C.)\r\n\r\nCOMING OF THE NORTHERN BARBARIANS\r\n\r\nThe barbarians who overthrew Aegean civilization seem to have entered\r\nGreece from the north, perhaps from the region the Danube River. They\r\npushed gradually southward, sometimes exterminating or enslaving the\r\nearlier inhabitants of the country, but more often settling peaceably\r\nin their new homes. Conquerors and conquered slowly intermingled and so\r\nproduced the one Greek people which is found at the dawn of history. These\r\nGreeks, as we shall call them henceforth, also occupied the islands of the\r\nAegean Sea and the coast of Asia Minor. The entire basin of the Aegean\r\nthus became a Greek world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AEGEAN SNAKE GODDESS (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\r\nA gold and ivory statuette found in Crete. Dates from the sixteenth\r\ncentury B.C. The goddess wears the characteristic Cretan dress, with low-\r\ncut jacket and full skirt with five plaited flounces. On her head is an\r\nelaborate crown.]\r\n\r\nTHE HOMERIC EPICS\r\n\r\nThe period between the end of the Aegean Age and the opening of historic\r\ntimes in Greece is usually called the Homeric Age, because many features\r\nof its civilization are reflected in two epic poems called the _Iliad_ and\r\nthe _Odyssey_. The former deals with the story of a Greek expedition\r\nagainst Troy; the latter describes the wanderings of the hero Odysseus on\r\nhis return from Troy. The two epics were probably composed in Ionia, and\r\nby the Greeks were attributed to a blind bard named Homer. Many modern\r\nscholars, however, consider them the work of several generations of poets.\r\nThe references in the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ to industry, social life,\r\nlaw, government, and religion give us some idea of the culture which the\r\nhistoric Greeks received as their inheritance.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRY\r\n\r\nThe Greeks as described in the Homeric epics were in a transitional stage\r\nbetween the life of shepherds and that of farmers. Wealth consisted\r\nchiefly of flocks and herds, though nearly every freeman owned a little\r\nplot of land on which he cultivated grain and cared for his orchard and\r\nvineyard. There were few skilled workmen, for almost everything was made\r\nat home. A separate class of traders had not yet arisen. Commerce was\r\nlittle followed. The Greeks depended on Phoenician sailors to bring to\r\ntheir shores the commodities which they could not produce themselves. Iron\r\nwas known and used, for instance, in the manufacture of farm tools. During\r\nHomeric times, however, that metal had not yet displaced copper and\r\nbronze. [8]\r\n\r\nSOCIAL LIFE\r\n\r\nSocial life was very simple. Princes tended flocks and built houses;\r\nprincesses carried water and washed clothes. Agamemnon, Odysseus, and\r\nother heroes were not ashamed to be their own butchers and cooks. The\r\nHomeric knights did not ride on horseback, but fought from chariots. They\r\nsat at table instead of reclining at meals, as did the later Greeks.\r\nCoined money was unknown. Trade was by barter, values being reckoned in\r\noxen or in lumps of gold and silver. Men bought their wives by making\r\ngifts of cattle to the parents. The art of writing is mentioned only once\r\nin the Homeric poems, and doubtless was little used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CRETAN CUPBEARER (Museum of Candia, Crete)\r\nA fresco painting from the palace of Gnossus. The youth carries a silver\r\ncup ornamented with gold. His waist is tightly drawn in by a girdle, his\r\nhair is dark and curly, his profile is almost classically Greek.]\r\n\r\nLAW AND MORALITY\r\n\r\nThe times were rude. Wars, though petty, were numerous and cruel. The\r\nvanquished suffered death or slavery. Piracy, flourishing upon the\r\nunprotected seas, ranked as an honorable occupation. It was no insult to\r\ninquire of a seafaring stranger whether he was pirate or merchant. Murders\r\nwere frequent. The murderer had to dread, not a public trial and\r\npunishment, but rather the personal vengeance of the kinsmen of his\r\nvictim. The Homeric Greeks, in fact, exhibited the usual defects and vices\r\nof barbarous peoples.\r\n\r\nHOMERIC GEOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nThe _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ disclose a considerable acquaintance with\r\npeninsular Greece and the coasts of Asia Minor. Cyprus, Egypt, and Sicily\r\nare also known in part. The poet imagines the earth as a sort of flat\r\nshield, with Greece lying in the center. [9] The Mediterranean, \"The Sea,\"\r\nas it is called by Homer, and its continuation, the Euxine, [10] divided\r\nthe world into two equal parts. Surrounding the earth was \"the great\r\nstrength of the Stream of Ocean,\" [11] a river, broad and deep, beyond\r\nwhich lay the dark and misty realm of the mythical Cimmerians. The\r\nunderworld of Hades, home of the dead, was beneath the surface of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, THE WORLD according to HOMER (900 B.C.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, GREEK CONQUESTS AND MIGRATIONS]\r\n\r\n\r\n24. EARLY GREEK RELIGION\r\n\r\nTHE OLYMPIAN COUNCIL\r\n\r\nWe may learn from the Homeric poems what were the religious ideas held by\r\nthe early Greeks. The greater gods and goddesses were not numerous. Less\r\nthan a score everywhere received worship under the same names and in all\r\nthe temples. Twelve of the chief deities formed a select council, which\r\nwas supposed to meet on the top of snow-crowned Olympus. The Greeks,\r\nhowever, did not agree as to what gods and goddesses should be included in\r\nthis august assemblage.\r\n\r\nATTRIBUTES OF THE DEITIES\r\n\r\nMany of the Olympian deities appear to have been simply personifications\r\nof natural phenomena. Zeus, \"father of gods and men,\" as Homer calls him,\r\nwas a heaven god, who gathered the clouds in storms and hurled the\r\nlightning bolt. Apollo, a mighty god of light, who warded off darkness and\r\nevil, became the ideal of manly beauty and the patron of music, poetry,\r\nand healing. Dionysus was worshiped as the god of sprouting and budding\r\nvegetation. Poseidon, brother of Zeus, ruled the sea. Hera, the wife of\r\nZeus, represented the female principle in nature. Hence she presided over\r\nthe life of women and especially over the sacred rites of marriage.\r\nAthena, who sprang full-grown from the forehead of Zeus, embodied the idea\r\nof wisdom and all womanly virtues. Aphrodite, who arose from the foam of\r\nthe sea, was the goddess of love and beauty. Demeter, the great earth-\r\nmother, watched over seed-time and harvest. Each deity thus had a kingdom\r\nand a function of its own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREEK GODS AND GODDESSES\r\n  ZEUS OTRICOLI, Vatican Gallery, Rome\r\n  HERA, Ludovisi Villa, Rome\r\n  APOLLO OF THE BELVEDERE, Vatican Gallery, Rome\r\n  APHRODITE OF CNIDUS, Glyptothek, Munich]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE APHRODITE OF MELOS (Louvre, Paris)\r\nMore commonly known as the \"Venus of Milo.\" The statue was discovered in\r\n1820 A.D. on the island of Melos. It consists of two principal pieces\r\njoined together across the folds of the drapery. Most art critics date\r\nthis work about 100 B.C. The strong serene figure of the goddess sets\r\nforth the Greek ideal of female loveliness.]\r\n\r\nCONCEPTIONS OF THE DEITIES\r\n\r\nThe Greeks made their gods and goddesses after themselves. The Olympian\r\ndivinities are really magnified men and women, subject to all human\r\npassions and appetites, but possessed of more than human power and endowed\r\nwith immortality. They enjoy the banquet, where they feast on nectar and\r\nambrosia; they take part in the struggles of the battle field; they marry\r\nand are given in marriage. The gods, morally, were no better than their\r\nworshipers. They might be represented as deceitful, dissolute, and cruel,\r\nbut they could also be regarded as upholders of truth and virtue. Even\r\nHomer could say, \"Verily the blessed gods love not evil deeds, but they\r\nreverence justice and the righteous acts of men.\" [12]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FRANÇOIS VASE (Archaeological Museum, Florence)\r\nFound in an Etruscan grave in 1844 A.D.

The after-life\r\nin Hades was believed to be a shadowy, joyless copy of the earthly\r\nexistence. In Hades the shade of great Achilles exclaims sorrowfully,\r\n\"Nay, speak not comfortably to me of death. Rather would I live on earth\r\nas the hireling of another, even with a landless man who had no great\r\nlivelihood, than bear sway among all the dead.\" [13] It was not until\r\nseveral centuries after Homer that happier notions of the future life were\r\ntaught, or at least suggested, in the Eleusinian mysteries. [14]\r\n\r\n\r\n25. RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS: ORACLES AND GAMES\r\n\r\nORACLE OF APOLLO AT DELPHI\r\n\r\nThe Greeks believed that communications from the gods were received from\r\ncertain inspired persons at places called oracles. The oracle of Apollo at\r\nDelphi in Phocis enjoyed the utmost veneration. It lay within a deep cave\r\non the rocky side of Mount Parnassus. Out of a chasm rose a volcanic vapor\r\nwhich had a certain intoxicating power. The Pythia, or prophetess of\r\nApollo, sat on a tripod over the steaming cleft and inhaled the gas. The\r\nwords she uttered in delirium were supposed to come from the god. They\r\nwere taken down by the attendant priests, written out in verse, and\r\ndelivered to the suppliants.\r\n\r\nINQUIRIES AT THE ORACLE\r\n\r\nThe fame of Apollo as the patron of inspiration and prophecy spread\r\nthroughout Greece and penetrated to foreign lands. Every year thousands of\r\nvisitors made their way to Apollo's shrine. Sick men prayed for health,\r\nchildless men prayed for offspring. Statesmen wished to learn the fate of\r\ntheir political schemes; ambassadors sent by kings and cities sought\r\nadvice as to weighty matters of peace and war. Above all, colonists came\r\nto Delphi in order to obtain directions as to the best country in which to\r\nsettle. Some of the noblest cities of the Greek world, Cyrene and\r\nByzantium, for example, [15] had their sites fixed by Apollo's guidance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONSULTING THE ORACLE AT DELPHI]\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF THE RESPONSES\r\n\r\nThe priests who managed the oracle and its responses were usually able to\r\ngive good advice to their inquirers, because news of every sort streamed\r\ninto Delphi. When the priests were doubtful what answer to give, the\r\nprophecy of the god was sometimes expressed in such ambiguous fashion\r\nthat, whatever the outcome, neither Apollo nor his servants could be\r\ncharged with deceit. For instance, when Croesus, the Lydian king, was\r\nabout to attack Cyrus, he learned from the oracle that \"if he warred with\r\nthe Persians he would overthrow a mighty empire\" [16]--but the mighty\r\nempire proved to be his own. [17]\r\n\r\nTHE OLYMPIAN GAMES\r\n\r\nAthletic games were held in different parts of Greece from a remote\r\nperiod. The most famous games were those in honor of Zeus at Olympia in\r\nElis. They took place every fourth year, in midsummer. [18] A sacred truce\r\nwas proclaimed for an entire month, in order that the thousands of\r\nspectators from every part of Greece might arrive and depart in safety. No\r\none not of Greek blood and no one convicted of crime or of the sin of\r\nimpiety might participate in the contests. The candidates had also to\r\nprove that they were qualified for the severe tests by a long and hard\r\ntraining. Once accepted as competitors, they could not withdraw. The man\r\nwho shrank back when the hour of trial arrived was considered a coward and\r\nwas punished with a heavy fine.\r\n\r\nTHE CONTESTS\r\n\r\nThe games occupied five days, beginning with the contests in running.\r\nThere was a short-distance dash through the length of the stadium, a\r\nquarter-mile race, and also a longer race, probably for two or three\r\nmiles. Then followed a contest consisting of five events: the long jump,\r\nhurling the discus, throwing the javelin, running, and wrestling. It is\r\nnot known how victory in these five events taken together was decided. In\r\nthe long jump, weights like dumb-bells were held in the hands, the swing\r\nof the weights being used to assist the spring. The discus, which weighed\r\nabout twelve pounds, was sometimes hurled more than one hundred feet. The\r\njavelin was thrown either by the hand alone or with the help of a thong\r\nwound about the shaft and held in the fingers. In wrestling, three falls\r\nwere necessary for a victory. The contestants were free to get their grip\r\nas best they could. Other contests included boxing, horse races, and\r\nchariot races. Women were apparently excluded from the games, yet they\r\nwere allowed to enter horses for the races and to set up statues in honor\r\nof the victors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DISCUS THROWER (DISCOBOLUS) (Lancelotti Palace, Rome)\r\nMarble copy of the bronze original by Myron, a sculptor of the fifth\r\ncentury B.C. Found in 1781 A.D. on the Esquiline Hill, Rome. The statue\r\nrepresents a young man, perhaps an athlete at the Olympian games, who is\r\nbending forward to hurl the discus. His body is thrown violently to the\r\nleft with a twisting action that brings every muscle into play.]\r\n\r\nTHE VICTOR'S REWARD\r\n\r\nThe Olympian festival was profoundly religious, because the display of\r\nmanly strength was thought to be a spectacle most pleasing to the gods.\r\nThe winning athlete received only a wreath of wild olive at Olympia, but\r\nat home he enjoyed the gifts and veneration of his fellow-citizens. Poets\r\ncelebrated his victories in noble odes. Sculptors reproduced his triumphs\r\nin stone and bronze. To the end of his days he remained a distinguished\r\nman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HERMES AND DIONYSUS (Museum of Olympia)\r\nAn original statue by the great sculptor, Praxiteles. It was found in 1877\r\nA.D. at Olympia. Hermes is represented carrying the child Dionysus, whom\r\nZeus had intrusted to his care. The symmetrical body of Hermes is\r\nfaultlessly modeled; the poise of his head is full of dignity; his\r\nexpression is refined and thoughtful. Manly strength and beauty have never\r\nbeen better embodied than in this work.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ATHLETE USING THE STRIGIL (APOXYOMENUS) (Vatican Gallery,\r\nRome)\r\n\r\nMarble copy of the bronze original by Lysippus, a sculptor of the fourth\r\ncentury B.C. The statue represents an athlete rubbing his arm with a flesh\r\nscraper to remove the oil and sand of the palestra, or exercising ground.\r\nHis slender form suggests quickness and agility rather than great\r\nstrength.]\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE GAMES\r\n\r\nThere were few Greeks who at least once in their lives did not attend the\r\nfestival. The crowds that gathered before and after the games turned the\r\ncamp into a great fair, at which merchants set up their shops and money\r\nchangers their tables. Poets recited their lines before admiring audiences\r\nand artists exhibited their masterpieces to intending purchasers. Heralds\r\nread treaties recently formed between Greek cities, in order to have them\r\nwidely known. Orators addressed the multitude on subjects of general\r\ninterest. The games thus helped to preserve a sense of fellowship among\r\nGreek communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n26. THE GREEK CITY-STATE\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE CITY STATE\r\n\r\nThe Greeks in Homeric times had already begun to live in towns and cities.\r\nA Greek city, being independent and self-governing, is properly called a\r\ncity-state. Just as a modern nation, it could declare war, arrange\r\ntreaties, and make alliances with its neighbors. Such a city-state\r\nincluded not only the territory within its walls, but also the surrounding\r\ndistrict where many of the citizens lived.\r\n\r\nTHE CITIZENS\r\n\r\nThe members of a Greek city-state were very closely associated. The\r\ncitizens believed themselves to be descended from a common ancestor and so\r\nto be all related. They were united, also, in the worship of the patron\r\ngod or hero who had them under his protection. These ties of supposed\r\nkinship and common religion were of the utmost importance. They made\r\ncitizenship a privilege which came to a person only by birth, a privilege\r\nwhich he lost by removal to another city. Elsewhere he was only a\r\nforeigner without legal rights--a man without a country.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT OF THE CITY-STATE\r\n\r\nThe Homeric poems, which give us our first view of the Greek city-state,\r\nalso contain the most ancient account of its government. Each city-state\r\nhad a king, \"the shepherd of the people\" [19] as Homer calls him. The king\r\ndid not possess absolute authority. He was surrounded by a council of\r\nnobles, chiefly the great landowners of the community. They helped him in\r\njudgment and sacrifice, followed him to war, and filled the principal\r\noffices. Both king and nobles were obliged to consult the common people on\r\nmatters of great importance. For this purpose the ruler would summon the\r\ncitizens to the market place to hear the deliberations of his council and\r\nto settle such questions as making war or declaring peace. All men of free\r\nbirth could attend the assembly, where they shouted assent to the decision\r\nof their leaders or showed disapproval by silence. This public assembly\r\nhad little importance in the Homeric Age, but later it became the center\r\nof Greek democracy.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE CITY-STATE\r\n\r\nAfter the middle of the eighth century B.C., when historic times began in\r\nGreece, some interesting changes took place in the government of the city-\r\nstates. In some of them, for example, Thebes and Corinth, the nobles\r\nbecame strong enough to abolish the kingship altogether. Monarchy, the\r\nrule of one, thus gave away to aristocracy, [20] the rule of the nobles.\r\nIn other states, for instance, Sparta and Argos, the kings were not driven\r\nout, but their power was much weakened. Some states came under the control\r\nof usurpers whom the Greeks called \"tyrants.\" A tyrant was a man who\r\ngained supreme power by force and governed for his own benefit without\r\nregard to the laws. There were many tyrannies in the Greek world during\r\nthe seventh and sixth centuries B.C. Still other states went through an\r\nentire cycle of changes from kingship to aristocracy, from aristocracy to\r\ntyranny, and from tyranny to democracy or popular rule.\r\n\r\nSPARTA AND ATHENS AS TYPES OF THE CITY-STATE\r\n\r\nThe isolated and independent Greek communities thus developed at an early\r\nperiod many different kinds of government. To study them all would be a\r\nlong task. It is better to fix our attention on the two city-states which\r\nheld the principal place in Greek history and at the same time presented\r\nthe most striking contrasts in government and social life. These were\r\nSparta and Athens.\r\n\r\n\r\n27. THE GROWTH OF SPARTA (TO 500 B.C.)\r\n\r\nSPARTA AND THE PELOPONNESIAN LEAGUE\r\n\r\nThe Greek invaders who entered southern Greece, or the Peloponnesus, [21]\r\nwere known as Dorians. They founded the city of Sparta, in the district of\r\nLaconia. By the close of the sixth century B.C. the Spartans were able to\r\nconquer their immediate neighbors and to organize some of the city-states\r\nof the Peloponnesus into a strong confederacy called the Peloponnesian\r\nLeague. The members of the league did not pay tribute, but they furnished\r\ntroops to serve in war under Spartan leaders, and they looked to Sparta\r\nfor guidance and protection. Thus this single city became the foremost\r\npower in southern Greece.\r\n\r\nSPARTA A MILITARY CAMP\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the Spartans must have been an extremely vigorous and\r\nwarlike people. Their city, in fact, formed a military camp, garrisoned by\r\nsoldiers whose whole life was passed in war and in preparation for war.\r\nThe Spartans were able to devote themselves to martial pursuits because\r\nthey possessed a large number of serfs, called helots. The helots tilled\r\nthe lands of the Spartans and gave up to their masters the entire product\r\nof their labor, except what was necessary for a bare subsistence.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT OF SPARTA\r\n\r\nSpartan government also had a military character. In form the state was a\r\nkingdom, but since there were always two kings reigning at once and\r\nenjoying equal authority, neither of them could become very powerful. The\r\nreal management of public affairs lay in the hands of five men, known as\r\nephors, who were elected every year by the popular assembly. The ephors\r\naccompanied the kings in war and directed their actions; guided the\r\ndeliberations of the council of nobles and the assembly of freemen;\r\nsuperintended the education of children; and exercised a general oversight\r\nof the private life of citizens. The ephors had such absolute control over\r\nthe lives and property of the Spartans that we may describe their rule as\r\nsocialistic and select Sparta as an example of ancient state socialism.\r\nNowhere else in the Greek world was the welfare of the individual man so\r\nthoroughly subordinated to the interests of the society of which he formed\r\na unit.\r\n\r\nTHE SPARTAN BOY\r\n\r\nSpartan education had a single purpose--to produce good soldiers and\r\nobedient citizens. A sound body formed the first essential. A father was\r\nrequired to submit his son, soon after birth, to an inspection by the\r\nelders of his tribe. If they found the child puny or ill-shaped, they\r\nordered it to be left on the mountain side, to perish from exposure. At\r\nthe age of seven a boy was taken from his parents' home and placed in a\r\nmilitary school. Here he was trained in marching, sham fighting, and\r\ngymnastics. He learned to sing warlike songs and in conversation to\r\nexpress himself in the fewest possible words. Spartan brevity of speech\r\nbecame proverbial. Above all he learned to endure hardship without\r\ncomplaint. He went barefoot and wore only a single garment, winter and\r\nsummer. He slept on a bed of rushes. Every year he and his comrades had to\r\nsubmit to a flogging before the altar of the goddess Artemis, and the hero\r\nwas the lad who could bear the whipping longest without giving a sign of\r\npain. It is said that boys sometimes died under the lash rather than utter\r\na cry. Such ordeals are still a feature of savage life to-day.\r\n\r\nTHE ADULT SPARTAN\r\n\r\nOn reaching the age of twenty the youth was considered a warrior. He did\r\nnot live at home, but passed his time in barracks, as a member of a\r\nmilitary mess to which he contributed his proper share of food, wine, and\r\nmoney. At the age of thirty years the young Spartan became a full citizen\r\nand a member of the popular assembly. He was then compelled to marry in\r\norder to raise children for the state. But marriage did not free him from\r\nattendance at the public meals, the drill ground, and the gymnasium. A\r\nSpartan, in fact, enjoyed little home life until his sixtieth year, when\r\nhe became an elder and retired from actual service.\r\n\r\nEXCELLENCE OF THE SPARTAN SOLDIERY\r\n\r\nThis exclusive devotion to military pursuits accomplished its object. The\r\nSpartans became the finest soldiers of antiquity. \"All the rest of the\r\nGreeks,\" says an ancient writer, \"are amateurs; the Spartans are\r\nprofessionals in the conduct of war.\" [22] Though Sparta never produced\r\ngreat thinkers, poets or artists, her military strength made her the\r\nbulwark of Greece against foreign foes. The time was to come when Greece,\r\nto retain her liberties, would need this disciplined Spartan soldiery.\r\n[23]\r\n\r\n\r\n28. THE GROWTH OF ATHENS (to 500 B.C.)\r\n\r\nATHENS AS A CITY-STATE\r\n\r\nThe district of Attica, though smaller than our smallest American\r\ncommonwealth, was early filled with a number of independent city-states.\r\nIt was a great step in advance when, long before the dawn of Greek\r\nhistory, these tiny communities were united with Athens. The inhabitants\r\nof the Attic towns and villages gave up their separate governments and\r\nbecame members of the one city-state of Athens. Henceforth a man was a\r\nAthenian citizen, no matter in what part of Attica he lived.\r\n\r\nOPPRESSIVE RULE OF THE NOBLES\r\n\r\nAt an earlier period, perhaps, than elsewhere in Greece, monarchy at\r\nAthens disappeared before the rising power of the nobles. The rule of the\r\nnobility bore harshly on the common people. Popular discontent was\r\nespecially excited at the administration of justice. There were at first\r\nno written laws, but only the long-established customs of the community.\r\nSince all the judges were nobles, they were tempted to decide legal cases\r\nin favor of their own class. The people, at length, began to clamor for a\r\nwritten code. They could then know just what the laws were.\r\n\r\nDRACO'S CODE, 621 B.C.\r\n\r\nAfter much agitation an Athenian named Draco was employed to write out a\r\ncode for the state. The laws, as published, were very severe. The penalty\r\nfor most offenses, even the smallest theft, was death. The Athenians used\r\nto declare that the Draconian code had been written, \"not in ink, but in\r\nblood.\" Its publication, however, was a popular triumph and the first step\r\ntoward the establishment of Athenian democracy.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATION OF SOLON, 594-593 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe second step was the legislation of Solon. This celebrated Athenian was\r\naccounted among the wisest men of his age. The people held him in high\r\nhonor and gave him power to make much-needed reforms. At this time the\r\ncondition of the Attic peasants was deplorable. Many of them had failed to\r\npay their rent to the wealthy landowners, and according to the old custom\r\nwere being sold into slavery. Solon abolished the custom and restored to\r\nfreedom all those who had been enslaved for debt. He also limited the\r\namount of land which a noble might hold. By still another law he admitted\r\neven the poorest citizens to the popular assembly, where they could vote\r\nfor magistrates and judge of their conduct after their year of office was\r\nover. By giving the common people a greater share in the government, Solon\r\nhelped forward the democratic movement at Athens.\r\n\r\nTYRANNY OF PISISTRATUS, 560-527 B.C.\r\n\r\nSolon's reforms satisfied neither the nobility nor the commons. The two\r\nclasses continued their rivalry until the disorder of the times enabled an\r\nambitious politician to gain supreme power as a tyrant. [24] He was\r\nSolon's own nephew, a noble named Pisistratus. The tyrant ruled with\r\nmoderation and did much to develop the Athenian city-state. He fostered\r\nagriculture by dividing the lands of banished nobles among the peasants.\r\nHis alliances with neighboring cities encouraged the rising commerce of\r\nAthens. The city itself was adorned with handsome buildings by architects\r\nand sculptors whom Pisistratus invited to his court from all parts of\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\nREFORMS OF CLISTHENES, 508-507 B.C.\r\n\r\nPisistratus was succeeded by his two sons, but the Athenians did not take\r\nkindly to their rule. Before long the tyranny came to an end. The\r\nAthenians now found a leader in a noble named Clisthenes, who proved to be\r\nan able statesman. He carried still further the democratic movement begun\r\nby Draco and Solon. One of his reforms extended Athenian citizenship to\r\nmany foreigners and emancipated slaves (\"freedmen\") then living in Attica.\r\nThis liberal measure swelled the number of citizens and helped to make the\r\nAthenians a more progressive people. Clisthenes, it is said, also\r\nestablished the curious arrangement known as ostracism. Every year, if\r\nnecessary, the citizens were to meet in assembly and to vote against any\r\npersons whom they thought dangerous to the state. If as many as six\r\nthousand votes were cast, the man who received the highest number of votes\r\nhad to go into honorable exile for ten years. [25] Though ostracism was\r\nintended as a precaution against tyrants, before long it came to be used\r\nto remove unpopular politicians.\r\n\r\nATHENS A DEMOCRATIC STATE\r\n\r\nThere were still some steps to be taken before the rule of the people was\r\ncompletely secured at Athens. But, in the main, the Athenians by 500 B.C.\r\nhad established a truly democratic government, the first in the history of\r\nthe world. The hour was now rapidly approaching when this young and\r\nvigorous democracy was to show forth its worth before the eyes of all\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\n\r\n29. COLONIAL EXPANSION OF GREECE (ABOUT 750-500 B.C.)\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT AGE OF COLONIZATION\r\n\r\nWhile Athens, Sparta, and their sister states were working out the\r\nproblems of government, another significant movement was going on in the\r\nGreek world. The Greeks, about the middle of the eighth century B.C.,\r\nbegan to plant numerous colonies along the shores of the Mediterranean and\r\nof the Black Sea. The great age of colonization covered more than two\r\nhundred years. [26]\r\n\r\nREASONS FOR FOUNDING COLONIES\r\n\r\nSeveral reasons led to the founding of colonies. Trade was an important\r\nmotive. The Greeks, like the Phoenicians, [27] could realize large profits\r\nby exchanging their manufactured goods for the food and raw materials of\r\nother countries. Land hunger was another motive. The poor soil of Greece\r\ncould not support many inhabitants and, when population increased,\r\nemigration afforded the only means of relieving the pressure of numbers. A\r\nthird motive was political and social unrest. Greek cities at this period\r\ncontained many men of adventurous disposition who were ready to seek in\r\nforeign countries a refuge from the oppression of nobles or tyrants. They\r\nhoped to find in their new settlements more freedom than they had at home.\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF THE GREEK COLONY\r\n\r\nA Greek colony was not simply a trading post; it was a center of Greek\r\nlife. The colonists continued to be Greeks in customs, language, and\r\nreligion. Though quite independent of the parent state, they always\r\nregarded it with reverence and affection: they called themselves \"men away\r\nfrom home.\" Mother city and daughter colony traded with each other and in\r\ntime of danger helped each other. A symbol of this unity was the sacred\r\nfire carried from the public hearth of the old community to the new\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nCOLONIZATION IN THE NORTH AND EAST\r\n\r\nThe Greeks planted many colonies on the coast of the northern Aegean and\r\non both sides of the long passage between the Mediterranean and the Black\r\nSea. Their most important colony was Byzantium, upon the site where\r\nConstantinople now stands. They also made settlements along the shores of\r\nthe Black Sea. The cities founded here were centers from which the Greeks\r\ndrew their supplies of fish, wood, wool, grain, metals, and slaves. The\r\nimmense profits to be gained by trade made the Greeks willing to live in a\r\ncold country so unlike their own and among barbarous peoples.\r\n\r\nCOLONIZATION IN THE WEST\r\n\r\nThe western lands furnished far more attractive sites for colonization.\r\nThe Greeks could feel at home in southern Italy, where the genial climate,\r\npure air, and sparkling sea recalled their native land. At a very early\r\ndate they founded Cumae, on the coast just north of the bay of Naples.\r\nEmigrants from Cumae, in turn, founded the city of Neapolis (Naples),\r\nwhich in Roman times formed a home of Greek culture and even to-day\r\npossesses a large Greek population. To secure the approaches from Greece\r\nto these remote colonies, two strongholds were established on the strait\r\nof Messina: Regium (modern Reggio) on the Italian shore and Messana\r\n(modern Messina) on that of Sicily. Another important colony in southern\r\nItaly was Tarentum (modern Taranto).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"TEMPLE OF NEPTUNE,\" PAESTUM\r\nPaestum, the Greek Poseidonia, was a colony of Sybaris The malarial\r\natmosphere of the place led to its desertion in the ninth century of our\r\nera. Hence the buildings there were not used as quarries for later\r\nstructures. The so called \"Temple of Neptune\" at Paestum is one of the\r\nbest preserved monuments of antiquity.]\r\n\r\nTHE SICILIAN COLONIES\r\n\r\nGreek settlements in Sicily were mainly along the coast. Expansion over\r\nthe entire island was checked by the Carthaginians, who had numerous\r\npossessions at its western extremity. The most celebrated colony in Sicily\r\nwas Syracuse, established by emigrants from Corinth. It became the largest\r\nof Greek cities.\r\n\r\nOTHER MEDITERRANEAN COLONIES\r\n\r\nIn Corsica, Sardinia, and on the coast of Spain Carthage also proved too\r\nobstinate a rival for the Greeks to gain much of a foothold. The city of\r\nMassilia (Marseilles), at the mouth of the Rhone, was their chief\r\nsettlement in ancient Gaul. Two colonies on the southern shore of the\r\nMediterranean were Cyrene, west of Egypt, and Naucratis, in the Delta of\r\nthe Nile. From this time many Greek travelers visited Egypt to see the\r\nwonders of that strange old country.\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF COLONIZATION\r\n\r\nEnergetic Greeks, the greatest colonizers of antiquity, thus founded\r\nsettlements from the Black Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. \"All the Greek\r\ncolonies\" says an ancient writer, \"are washed by the waves of the sea,\r\nand, so to speak, a fringe of Greek earth is woven on to foreign lands.\"\r\n[28] To distinguish themselves from the foreigners, or \"barbarians,\" [29]\r\nabout them, the Greeks began to call themselves by the common name of\r\nHellenes. Hellas, their country, came to include all the territory\r\npossessed by Hellenic peoples. The life of the Greeks, henceforth, was\r\nconfined no longer within the narrow limits of the Aegean. Wherever rose a\r\nGreek city, there was a scene of Greek history.\r\n\r\n\r\n30. BONDS OF UNION AMONG THE GREEKS\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE AS A UNIFYING FORCE\r\n\r\nThe Greek colonies, as we have seen, were free and independent. In Greece\r\nitself the little city-states were just as jealous of their liberties.\r\nNevertheless ties existed, not of common government, but of common\r\ninterests and ideals, which helped to unite the scattered sections of the\r\nGreek world. The strongest bond of union was, of course, the one Greek\r\nspeech. Everywhere the people used the same beautiful and expressive\r\nlanguage. It is not a \"dead\" language, for it still lives in modified form\r\non the lips of nearly three million people in the Greek peninsula,\r\nthroughout the Mediterranean, and even in remote America.\r\n\r\nLITERATURE AS UNIFYING FORCE; HOMER\r\n\r\nGreek literature, likewise, made for unity. The _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_\r\nwere recited in every Greek village for centuries. They formed the\r\nprincipal textbook in the schools; an Athenian philosopher calls Homer the\r\n\"educator of Hellas.\" It has been well said that these two epics were at\r\nonce the Bible and the Shakespeare of the Greek people.\r\n\r\nRELIGION AS A UNIFYING FORCE; AMPHICTYONIES\r\n\r\nReligion formed another bond of union. Everywhere the Greeks worshiped the\r\nsame gods and performed the same sacred rites. Religious influences were\r\nsometimes strong enough to bring about federations known as amphictyonies,\r\nor leagues of neighbors. The people living around a famous sanctuary would\r\nmeet to observe their festivals in common and to guard the shrine of their\r\ndivinity. The Delphic amphictyony was the most noteworthy of these local\r\nunions. It included twelve tribes and cities of central Greece and\r\nThessaly. They established a council, which took the shrine of Apollo\r\nunder its protection and superintended the athletic games at Delphi.\r\n\r\nA NEW AGE\r\n\r\nThe seventh and sixth centuries before Christ form a noteworthy epoch in\r\nGreek history. Commerce and colonization were bringing their educating\r\ninfluence to bear upon the Greeks. Hellenic cities were rising everywhere\r\nalong the Mediterranean shores. A common language, literature, and\r\nreligion were making the people more and more conscious of their unity as\r\nopposed to the \"barbarians\" about them.\r\n\r\nTHE GREEK WORLD, 500 B.C.\r\n\r\nGreek history has now been traced from its beginnings to about 500 B.C. It\r\nis the history of a people, not of one country or of a united nation. Yet\r\nthe time was drawing near when all the Greek communities were to be\r\nbrought together in closer bonds of union than they had ever before known.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n31. THE PERILS OF HELLAS\r\n\r\nASIATIC GREEKS CONQUERED BY CROESUS\r\n\r\nThe history of the Greeks for many centuries had been uneventful--a\r\nhistory of their uninterrupted expansion over barbarian lands. But now the\r\ntime was approaching when the independent and isolated Greek communities\r\nmust meet the attack of the great despotic empires of Asia. The Greek\r\ncities of Asia Minor were the first part of the Hellenic world to be\r\ninvolved. Their conquest by the Lydian king, Croesus, about the middle of\r\nthe sixth century B.C., showed how grave was the danger to Greek\r\nindependence from the ambitious designs of Oriental monarchs.\r\n\r\nCONQUESTS OF CYRUS AND CAMBYSES\r\n\r\nAs we have already learned, Croesus himself soon had to submit to a\r\nforeign overlord, in the person of Cyrus the Great. The subjugation of\r\nLydia and the Greek seaboard by Cyrus extended the Persian Empire to the\r\nMediterranean. The conquest of Phoenicia and Cyprus by Cambyses added the\r\nPhoenician navy to the resources of the mighty empire. Persia had now\r\nbecome a sea power, able to cope with the Greeks on their own element. The\r\nsubjection of Egypt by the same king led naturally to the annexation of\r\nthe Greek colonies on the north African shore. The entire coast of the\r\neastern Mediterranean had now come under the control of a new, powerful,\r\nand hostile state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROESUS ON THE PYRE\r\nPainting on an Athenian vase of about 490 B.C. According to the legend\r\nCyrus the Great, having made Croesus prisoner, intended to burn him on a\r\npyre. But the god Apollo, to whose oracle at Delphi Croesus had sent rich\r\ngifts, put out the blaze by a sudden shower of rain. The vase painting\r\nrepresents the Lydian king sitting enthroned upon the pyre, with a laurel\r\nwreath on his head and a scepter in one hand. With the other hand he pours\r\na libation. He seems to be performing a religious rite, not to be\r\nsuffering an ignominious death.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERSIAN ARCHERS (Louvre, Paris)\r\nA frieze of enameled brick from the royal palace at Susa. It is a\r\nmasterpiece of Persian art and shows the influence of both Assyrian and\r\nGreek design. Each archer carries a spear, in addition to the bow over the\r\nleft shoulder and the quiver on the back. These soldiers probably served\r\nas palace guards, hence the fine robes worn by them.]\r\n\r\nCONQUESTS OF DARIUS\r\n\r\nThe accession of Darius to the Persian throne only increased the dangers\r\nthat overshadowed Hellas. He aimed to complete the work of Cyrus and\r\nCambyses by extending the empire wherever a natural frontier had not been\r\nreached. Accordingly, about 512 B.C., Darius invaded Europe with a large\r\narmy, annexed the Greek colonies on the Hellespont (the modern\r\nDardanelles), and subdued the wild tribes of Thrace and Macedonia. The\r\nPersian dominions now touched those of the Greeks. [2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, GREECE at opening of the PERSIAN WARS 400 B.C.]\r\n\r\nTHE IONIAN REVOLT, 499-493 B.C.\r\n\r\nNot long after this European expedition of Darius, the Ionian cities of\r\nAsia Minor revolted against the Persians. Unable to face their foes\r\nsingle-handed, they sought aid from Sparta, then the chief military power\r\nof Greece. The Spartans refused to take part in the war, but the\r\nAthenians, who realized the menace to Greece in the Persian advance, sent\r\nships and men to fight for the Ionians. Even with this help the Ionian\r\ncities could not hold out against the vast resources of the Persians. One\r\nby one they fell again into the hands of the Great King.\r\n\r\n\r\n32. EXPEDITIONS OF DARIUS AGAINST GREECE\r\n\r\nFIRST EXPEDITION, 492 B.C.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was quiet restored in Asia Minor than Darius began preparations\r\nto punish Athens for her part in the Ionian Revolt. The first expedition\r\nunder the command of Mardonius, the son-in-law of the Persian monarch, was\r\na failure. Mardonius never reached Greece, because the Persian fleet, on\r\nwhich his army depended for provisions, was wrecked off the promontory of\r\nMount Athos.\r\n\r\nSECOND EXPEDITION, 490 B.C.\r\n\r\nDarius did not abandon his designs, in consequence of the disaster. Two\r\nyears later a second fleet, bearing a force of perhaps sixty thousand men,\r\nset out from Ionia for Greece. Datis and Artaphernes, the Persian leaders,\r\nsailed straight across the Aegean and landed on the plain of Marathon,\r\ntwenty-six miles from Athens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAVESTONE OF ARISTON (National Museum, Athens)\r\nFound near Marathon in 1838 A.D. Belongs to the late sixth century B.C.\r\nIncorrectly called the \"Warrior of Marathon\"]\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF MARATHON, 490 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the Athenians seemed desperate. They had scarcely ten\r\nthousand men with whom to face an army far larger and hitherto invincible.\r\nThe Spartans promised support, but delayed sending troops at the critical\r\nmoment. Better, perhaps, than a Spartan army was the genius of Miltiades,\r\none of the Athenian generals. Relying on Greek discipline and Greek valor\r\nto win the day, he decided to take the offensive. His heavy armed soldiers\r\nmade a smashing charge on the Persians and drove them in confusion to\r\ntheir ships. Datis and Artaphernes then sailed back to Asia with their\r\nerrand of vengeance unfulfilled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREEK SOLDIERS IN ARMS\r\nPainting on a Greek vase]\r\n\r\nPOLICIES OF ARISTIDES AND THEMISTOCLES\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Marathon the Athenians began to make preparations to\r\nresist another Persian invasion. One of their leaders, the eminent\r\nAristides, thought that they should increase their army and meet the enemy\r\non land. His rival, Themistocles, urged a different policy. He would\r\nsacrifice the army to the navy and make Athens the strongest sea power in\r\nGreece. The safety of Athens, he argued, lay in her ships. In order to\r\nsettle the question the opposing statesmen were put to the test of\r\nostracism. [3] The vote went against Aristides, who was obliged to\r\nwithdraw into exile. Themistocles, now master of the situation, persuaded\r\nthe citizens to use the revenues from some silver mines in Attica for the\r\nupbuilding of a fleet. When the Persians came, the Athenians were able to\r\noppose them with nearly two hundred triremes [4]--the largest navy in\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\n\r\n33. XERXES AND THE GREAT PERSIAN WAR\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS OF PERSIA\r\n\r\n\"Ten years after Marathon,\" says a Greek historian, \"the 'barbarians'\r\nreturned with the vast armament which was to enslave Hellas.\" [5] Darius\r\nwas now dead, but his son Xerxes had determined to complete his task. Vast\r\nquantities of provisions were collected; the Hellespont was bridged with\r\nboats; and the rocky promontory of Mount Athos, where a previous fleet had\r\nsuffered shipwreck, was pierced with a canal. An army of several hundred\r\nthousand men was brought together from all parts of the Great King's\r\ndomain. He evidently intended to crush the Greeks by sheer weight of\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A THEMISTOCLES OSTRAKON (British Museum, London)\r\nA fragment of a potsherd found in 1897 A.D., near the Acropolis of Athens.\r\nThis ostrakon was used to vote for the ostracism of Themistocles, either\r\nin 483 B.C. when he was victorious against Aristides, or some ten years\r\nlater, when Themistocles was himself defeated and forced into exile.]\r\n\r\nGREEK PREPARATIONS\r\n\r\nXerxes did not have to attack a united Greece. His mighty preparations\r\nfrightened many of the Greek states into yielding, when Persian heralds\r\ncame to demand \"earth and water,\" the customary symbols of submission.\r\nSome of the other states, such as Thebes, which was jealous of Athens, and\r\nArgos, equally jealous of Sparta, did nothing to help the loyal Greeks\r\nthroughout the struggle. But Athens and Sparta with their allies remained\r\njoined for resistance to the end. Upon the suggestion of Themistocles a\r\ncongress of representatives from the patriotic states assembled at the\r\nisthmus of Corinth in 481 B.C. Measures of defense were taken, and Sparta\r\nwas put in command of the allied fleet and army.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THERMOPYLAE, 480 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe campaigns of the Great Persian War have been described, once for all,\r\nin the glowing pages of the Greek historian, Herodotus. [6] Early in the\r\nyear 480 B.C. the Persian host moved out of Sardis, crossed the\r\nHellespont, and advanced to the pass of Thermopylae, commanding the\r\nentrance to central Greece. This position, one of great natural strength,\r\nwas held by a few thousand Greeks under the Spartan king, Leonidas. For\r\ntwo days Xerxes hurled his best soldiers against the defenders of\r\nThermopylae, only to find that numbers did not count in that narrow\r\ndefile. There is no telling how long the handful of Greeks might have kept\r\nback the Persian hordes, had not treachery come to the aid of the enemy. A\r\ntraitor Greek revealed to Xerxes the existence of an unfrequented path,\r\nleading over the mountain in the rear of the pass. A Persian detachment\r\nmarched over the trail by night and took up a position behind the Greeks.\r\nThe latter still had time to escape, but three hundred Spartans and\r\nperhaps two thousand allies refused to desert their post. While Persian\r\nofficers provided with whips lashed their unwilling troops to battle,\r\nLeonidas and his men fought till spears and swords were broken, and hands\r\nand teeth alone remained as weapons. Xerxes at length gained the pass--but\r\nonly over the bodies of its heroic defenders. Years later a monument to\r\ntheir memory was raised on the field of battle. It bore the simple\r\ninscription: \"Stranger, go tell the Spartans that we lie here in obedience\r\nto their commands.\" [7]\r\n\r\nAFTER THERMOPYLAE\r\n\r\nAfter the disaster at Thermopylae nearly all the states of central Greece\r\nsubmitted to the Persians. They marched rapidly through Boeotia and Attica\r\nto Athens, but found a deserted city. Upon the advice of Themistocles the\r\nnon-combatants had withdrawn to places of safety, and the entire fighting\r\nforce of Athens had embarked on the ships. The Athenian fleet took up a\r\nposition in the strait separating the island of Salamis from Attica and\r\nawaited the enemy. [8]\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF SALAMIS, 480 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Salamis affords an interesting example of naval tactics in\r\nantiquity. The trireme was regarded as a missile to be hurled with sudden\r\nviolence against the opposing ship, in order to disable or sink it. A sea\r\nfight became a series of maneuvers; and victory depended as much on the\r\nskill of the rowers and steersmen as on the bravery of the soldiers. The\r\nPersians at Salamis had many more ships than the Greeks, but Themistocles\r\nrightly believed that in the narrow strait their numbers would be a real\r\ndisadvantage to them. Such proved to be the case. The Persians fought\r\nwell, but their vessels, crowded together, could not navigate properly and\r\neven wrecked one another by collision. After an all-day contest what\r\nremained of their fleet withdrew from the strait.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ATHENIAN TRIREME (Reconstruction)\r\nA trireme is supposed to have had three tiers or banks of oars, placed one\r\nabove the other. Each tier thus required an oar about a yard longer than\r\nthe one immediately beneath it. There were about two hundred rowers on a\r\ntrireme.]\r\n\r\nAFTER SALAMIS\r\n\r\nThe victory at Salamis had important results. It so crippled the Persians\r\nthat henceforth they lost command of the sea. Xerxes found it difficult to\r\nkeep his men supplied with provisions and at once withdrew with the larger\r\npart of his force to Asia. The Great King himself had no heart for further\r\nfighting, but he left Mardonius, with a strong body of picked troops, to\r\nsubjugate the Greeks on land. So the real crisis of the war was yet to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nBATTLES OF PLATAEA AND MYCALE, 479 B.C.\r\n\r\nMardonius passed the winter quietly in Thessaly, preparing for the spring\r\ncampaign. The Greeks in their turn made a final effort. A strong Spartan\r\narmy, supported by the Athenians and their allies, met the Persians near\r\nthe little town of Plataea in Boeotia. Here the heavy-armed Greek\r\nsoldiers, with their long spears, huge shields, and powerful swords,\r\neasily overcame the enormous masses of the enemy. The success at Plataea\r\nshowed how superior to the Persians were the Greeks in equipment,\r\nleadership, and fighting power. At the same time as this battle the\r\nremainder of the Persian fleet suffered a crushing defeat at Mycale, a\r\npromontory off the Ionian coast. These two battles really ended the war.\r\nNever again was Persia to make a serious effort to secure dominion over\r\nContinental Greece.\r\n\r\nVICTORIUS HELLAS\r\n\r\nThe Great Persian War was much more than a conflict between two rival\r\nstates. It was a struggle between East and West; between Oriental\r\ndespotism and Occidental individualism. On the one side were all the\r\npopulous, centralized countries of Asia; on the other side, the small,\r\ndisunited states of Greece. In the East was the boundless wealth, in men\r\nand money, of a world-wide empire. In the West were the feeble resources\r\nof a few petty communities. Nevertheless Greece won. The story of her\r\nvictory forms an imperishable record in the annals of human freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n34. ATHENS UNDER THEMISTOCLES, ARISTIDES, AND CIMON\r\n\r\nTHEMISTOCLES AND THE FORTIFICATIONS OF ATHENS\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Plataea the Athenians, with their wives and children,\r\nreturned to Attica and began the restoration of their city, which the\r\nPersians had burned. Their first care was to raise a wall so high and\r\nstrong Athens in future would be impregnable to attack. Upon the\r\nsuggestion of Themistocles it was decided to include within the\r\nfortifications a wide area where all the country people, in case of\r\nanother invasion, could find a refuge. Themistocles also persuaded the\r\nAthenians to build a massive wall on the land side of Piraeus, the port\r\nof Athens. That harbor town now became the center of Athenian industry\r\nand commerce.\r\n\r\nARISTIDES AND THE DELIAN LEAGUE, 477 B.C.\r\n\r\nWhile the Athenians were rebuilding their city, important events were\r\ntaking place in the Aegean. After the battle of Mycale the Greek states in\r\nAsia Minor and on the islands once more rose in revolt against the\r\nPersians. Aided by Sparta and Athens, they gained several successes and\r\nremoved the immediate danger of another Persian attack. It was clearly\r\nnecessary, however, for the Greek cities in Asia Minor and the Aegean to\r\nremain in close alliance with the Continental Greeks, if they were to\r\npreserve their independence. Under the guidance of Aristides, the old\r\nrival of Themistocles, [9] the allies formed a union known as the Delian\r\nLeague.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THESEUM\"\r\nAn Athenian temple formerly supposed to have been constructed by Cimon to\r\nreceive the bones of the hero Theseus. It is now believed to have been a\r\ntemple of Hephaestus and Athena erected about 440 B.C. The 'Theseum' owes\r\nits almost perfect preservation to the fact that during the Middle Ages it\r\nwas used as a church.]\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTION OF THE LEAGUE\r\n\r\nThe larger cities in the league agreed to provide ships and crews for a\r\nfleet, while the smaller cities were to make their contributions in money.\r\nAthens assumed the presidency of the league, and Athenian officials\r\ncollected the revenues, which were placed in a treasury on the island of\r\nDelos. As head of this new federation Athens now had a position of\r\nsupremacy in the Aegean like that which Sparta enjoyed in the\r\nPeloponnesus. [10]\r\n\r\nCIMON AND THE WAR AGAINST PERSIA\r\n\r\nThe man who succeeded Themistocles and Aristides in leadership of the\r\nAthenians was Cimon, son of Miltiades, the hero of Marathon. While yet a\r\nyouth his gallantry at the battle of Salamis gained him a great\r\nreputation, and when Aristides introduced him to public life the citizens\r\nwelcomed him gladly. He soon became the head of the aristocratic or\r\nconservative party in the Athenian city. To Cimon the Delian League\r\nentrusted the continuation of the war with Persia. The choice was\r\nfortunate, for Cimon had inherited his father's military genius. No man\r\ndid more than he to humble the pride of Persia. As the outcome of Cimon's\r\nsuccessful campaigns the southern coast of Asia Minor was added to the\r\nDelian League, and the Greek cities at the mouth of the Black Sea were\r\nfreed from the Persian yoke. Thus, with Cimon as its leader, the\r\nconfederacy completed the liberation of the Asiatic Greeks.\r\n\r\nTHE DELIAN LEAGUE BECOMES SUBJECT TO ATHENS, ABOUT 454 B.C.\r\n\r\nWhile the Greeks were gaining these victories, the character of the Delian\r\nLeague was being transformed. Many of the cities, instead of furnishing\r\nships, had taken the easier course of making all their contributions in\r\nmoney. The change really played into the hands of Athens, for the tribute\r\nenabled the Athenians to build the ships themselves and add them to their\r\nown navy. They soon had a fleet powerful enough to coerce any city that\r\nfailed to pay its assessments or tried to withdraw from the league.\r\nEventually the common treasure was transferred from Delos to Athens. The\r\ndate of this event (454 B.C.) may be taken as marking the formal\r\nestablishment of the Athenian naval empire.\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF CIMON'S INFLUENCE\r\n\r\nSparta and her Peloponnesian allies viewed with growing jealousy the rapid\r\nrise of Athens. As long, however, as Cimon remained at the head of\r\nAthenian affairs, there was little danger of a break with Sparta. He\r\ndesired his city to keep on good terms with her powerful neighbor: Athens\r\nshould be mistress of the seas, and Sparta should be mistress on the\r\nmainland. A contest between them, Cimon foresaw, would work lasting injury\r\nto all Greece. Cimon's pro-Spartan attitude brought him, however, into\r\ndisfavor at Athens, and he was ostracized. New men and new policies\r\nhenceforth prevailed in the Athenian state.\r\n\r\n\r\n35. ATHENS UNDER PERICLES\r\n\r\nPERICLES\r\n\r\nThe ostracism of Cimon deprived the aristocrats of their most prominent\r\nrepresentative. It was possible for the democratic or liberal party to\r\nassume complete control of public affairs. Pericles, their leader and\r\nchampion, was a man of studious habits. He never appeared on the streets\r\nexcept when walking between his house and the popular assembly or the\r\nmarket place, kept rigidly away from dinners and drinking bouts, and ruled\r\nhis household with strict economy that he might escape the suspicion of\r\nenriching himself at the public expense. He did not speak often before the\r\npeople, but came forward only on special occasions; and the rarity of his\r\nutterances gave them added weight. Pericles was a thorough democrat, but\r\nhe used none of the arts of the demagogue. He scorned to flatter the\r\npopulace. His power over the people rested on his majestic eloquence, on\r\nhis calm dignity of demeanor, and above all on his unselfish devotion to\r\nthe welfare of Athens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERICLES (British Museum, London)\r\nThe bust is probably a good copy of a portrait statue set up during the\r\nlifetime of Pericles on the Athenian Acropolis. The helmet possibly\r\nindicates the office of General held by Pericles.]\r\n\r\nAGE OF PERICLES, 461-429 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe period, about thirty years in length, between the ostracism of Cimon\r\nand the death of Pericles, forms the most brilliant epoch in Greek\r\nhistory. Under the guidance of Pericles the Athenian naval empire reached\r\nits widest extent. Through his direction Athens became a complete\r\ndemocracy. Inspired by him the Athenians came to manifest that love of\r\nknowledge, poetry, art, and all beautiful things which, even more than\r\ntheir empire or their democracy, has made them famous in the annals of\r\nmankind. The Age of Pericles affords, therefore, a convenient opportunity\r\nto set forth the leading features of Athenian civilization in the days of\r\nits greatest glory.\r\n\r\nATHENIAN IMPERIALISM\r\n\r\nAthens under Pericles ruled more than two hundred towns and cities in Asia\r\nMinor and the islands of the Aegean Sea. [11] The subjects of Athens, in\r\nreturn for the protection that she gave them against Persia, owed many\r\nobligations. They paid an annual tribute and furnished soldiers in time of\r\nwar. In all legal cases of importance the citizens had to go to Athens for\r\ntrial by Athenian courts. The Delian communities, in some instances, were\r\nforced to endure the presence of Athenian garrisons and officers. To the\r\nGreeks at large all this seemed nothing less than high-handed tyranny.\r\nAthens, men felt, had built up an empire on the ruins of Hellenic liberty.\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\nIf the Athenians possessed an empire, they themselves were citizens of a\r\nstate more democratic than any other that has existed, before or since, in\r\nthe history of the world. They had now learned how unjust was the rule of\r\na tyrant or of a privileged class of nobles. They tried, instead, to\r\nafford every one an opportunity to make the laws, to hold office, and to\r\nadminister justice. Hence the Athenian popular assembly and law courts\r\nwere open to all respectable citizens. The offices, also, were made very\r\nnumerous--fourteen hundred in all--so that they might be distributed as\r\nwidely as possible. Most of them were annual, and some could not be held\r\ntwice by the same person. Election to office was usually by lot. This\r\narrangement did away with favoritism and helped to give the poor man a\r\nchance in politics, as well as the man of wealth or noble birth.\r\n\r\nTHE ASSEMBLY\r\n\r\nThe center of Athenian democracy was the Assembly. Its membership included\r\nevery citizen who had reached twenty years of age. Rarely, however, did\r\nthe attendance number more than five thousand, since most of the citizens\r\nlived outside the walls in the country districts of Attica. Forty regular\r\nmeetings were held every year. These took place on the slopes of the hill\r\ncalled the Pnyx. A speaker before the Assembly faced a difficult audience.\r\nIt was ready to yell its disapproval of his advice, to mock him if he\r\nmispronounced a word, or to drown his voice with shouts and whistles.\r\nNaturally, the debates became a training school for orators. No one could\r\nmake his mark in the Assembly who was not a clear and interesting speaker.\r\nVoting was by show of hands, except in cases affecting individuals, such\r\nas ostracism, when the ballot was used. Whatever the decision of the\r\nAssembly, it was final. This great popular gathering settled questions of\r\nwar and peace, sent out military and naval expeditions, voted public\r\nexpenditures, and had general control over the affairs of Athens and the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ATHENIAN INSCRIPTION\r\nA decree of the Assembly, dating from about 450 B.C.]\r\n\r\nTHE TEN GENERALS\r\n\r\nThe Assembly was assisted in the conduct of public business by many\r\nofficers and magistrates, among whom the Ten Generals held the leading\r\nplace. It was their duty to guide the deliberations of the Assembly and to\r\nexecute the orders of that body.\r\n\r\nTHE JURY COURTS\r\n\r\nThere was also a system of popular jury courts composed of citizens\r\nselected by lot from the candidates who presented themselves. The number\r\nof jurors varied; as many as a thousand might serve at an important trial.\r\nA court was both judge and jury, it decided by majority vote; and from its\r\ndecision lay no appeal. Before these courts public officers accused of\r\nwrong-doing were tried; disputes between different cities of the empire\r\nand other important cases were settled; and all ordinary legal business\r\naffecting the Athenians themselves was transacted. Thus, even in matters\r\nof law, the Athenian government was completely democratic.\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH AND WEAKNESS OF THE ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\nDemocracy then, reached its height in ancient Athens. The people ruled,\r\nand they ruled directly. Every citizen had some active part in politics.\r\nSuch a system worked well in the management of a small city-state like\r\nAthens. But if the Athenians could govern themselves, they proved unable\r\nto govern an empire with justice and wisdom. There was no such thing as\r\nrepresentation in their constitution. The subject cities had no one to\r\nspeak for them in the Assembly or before the jury courts. We shall notice\r\nthe same absence of a representative system in republican Rome. [12]\r\n\r\nSYSTEM OF STATE PAY\r\n\r\nA large number of Athenians were relieved from the necessity of working\r\nfor themselves through the system of state pay introduced by Pericles.\r\nJurors, soldiers, and sailors received money for their services. Later, in\r\nthe fourth century, citizens accepted fees for attending the Assembly.\r\nThese payments, though small, enabled poor citizens to devote much time to\r\npublic duties.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL ATHENS\r\n\r\nAthens contained many skilled workmen whose daily tasks gave them scant\r\nopportunity to engage in the exciting game of politics. The average rate\r\nof wages was very low. In spite of cheap food and modest requirements for\r\nclothing and shelter, it must have been difficult for the laborer to keep\r\nbody and soul together. Outside of Athens, in the country districts of\r\nAttica, lived the peasants whose little farms produced the olives, grapes,\r\nand figs for which Attica was celebrated.\r\n\r\nSLAVERY\r\n\r\nThere were many thousands of slaves in Athens and Attica at this period.\r\nTheir number was so great and their labor so cheap that we may think of\r\nthem as taking the place of modern machines. It was the slaves who did\r\nmost of the work on the large estates owned by wealthy men, who toiled in\r\nthe mines and quarries, and who served as oarsmen on the ships. The system\r\nof slavery enabled many an Athenian to live a life of leisure, but it\r\nlowered the dignity of labor and tended to prevent the rise of the poorer\r\ncitizens to positions of responsibility. In Greece, as in the Orient, [13]\r\nslavery cast its blight over free industry.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL ATHENS\r\n\r\nThe Athenian city was now the chief center of Greek commerce. [14] \"The\r\nfruits of the whole earth,\" said Pericles, \"flow in upon us; so that we\r\nenjoy the goods of other Commercial countries as freely as of our own.\"\r\n[15] Exports of Athens wine and olive oil, pottery, metal wares, and\r\nobjects of art were sent out from Piraeus [16] to every region of the\r\nMediterranean. The imports from the Black Sea region, Thrace, and the\r\nAegean included such commodities as salt, dried fish, wool, timber, hides,\r\nand, above all, great quantities of wheat. Very much as modern England,\r\nAthens was able to feed all her people only by bringing in food from\r\nabroad. To make sure that in time of war there should be no interruption\r\nof food supplies, the Athenians built the celebrated Long Walls, between\r\nthe city and its port of Piraeus. (See the map below) Henceforth they felt\r\nsecure from attack, as long as their navy ruled the Aegean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, THE VICINITY OF ATHENS]\r\n\r\nARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL ATHENS\r\n\r\nIn the days of her prosperity Athens began to make herself not only a\r\nstrong, but also a beautiful, city. The temples and other structures which\r\nwere raised on the Acropolis during the Age of Pericles still excite, even\r\nin their ruins, the envy and wonder of mankind. [17] Athens at this time\r\nwas also the center of Greek intellectual life. In no other period of\r\nsimilar length have so many admirable books been produced. No other epoch\r\nhas given birth to so many men of varied and delightful genius. The\r\ngreatest poets, historians, and philosophers of Greece were Athenians,\r\neither by birth or training. As Pericles himself said in a noble speech,\r\nAthens was \"the school of Hellas.\" [18]\r\n\r\n\r\n36. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR, 431-404 B.C.\r\n\r\nINEVITABLENESS OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nThe brilliant Age of Pericles had not come to an end before the two chief\r\npowers in the Hellenic world became involved in a deadly war. It would\r\nseem that Athens and Sparta, the one supreme upon the sea, the other at\r\nthe head of the Peloponnesus, might have avoided a struggle which was sure\r\nto be long and costly. But Greek cities were always ready to fight one\r\nanother. When Athens and Sparta found themselves rivals for the leadership\r\nof Greece, it was easy for the smouldering fires of distrust and jealousy\r\nto flame forth into open conflict. \"And at that time,\" says Thucydides,\r\nthe Athenian historian who described the struggle, \"the youth of Sparta\r\nand the youth of Athens were numerous; they had never seen war, and were\r\ntherefore very willing to take up arms.\" [19]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, GREECE at Opening of the PELOPONNESIAN WAR 431 B.C.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE \"MOURNING ATHENA\" (Acropolis Museum, Athens)\r\nA tablet of Pentelic marble. Athena, leaning on her spear, is gazing with\r\ndowncast head at a grave monument.]\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nThe conflict was brought on by Corinth, one of the leading members of the\r\nPeloponnesian League and, next to Athens, the most important commercial\r\npower in Greece. She had already seen her once-profitable trade in the\r\nAegean monopolized by Athens. That energetic city was now reaching out for\r\nCorinthian commerce in Italian and Sicilian waters. When the Athenians\r\nwent so far as to interfere in a quarrel between Corinth and her colony of\r\nCorcyra, even allying themselves with the latter city, the Corinthians\r\nfelt justly resentful and appealed to Sparta for aid. The Spartans\r\nlistened to their appeal and, with the apparent approval of the Delphic\r\noracle which assured them \"that they would conquer if they fought with all\r\ntheir might,\" [20] declared war.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES OF THE CONTESTANTS\r\n\r\nThe two antagonists were fairly matched. The one was strong where the\r\nother was weak. Sparta, mainly a continental power, commanded all the\r\nPeloponnesian states except Argos and Achaea, besides some of the smaller\r\nstates of central Greece. Athens, mainly a maritime power, ruled all the\r\nsubject cities of the Aegean. The Spartans possessed the most formidable\r\narmy then in the world, but lacked money and ships. The Athenians had a\r\nmagnificent navy, an overflowing treasury, and a city impregnable to\r\ndirect attack. It seemed, in fact, as if neither side could seriously\r\ninjure the other.\r\n\r\nFIRST STAGE OF THE WAR, 431-421 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe war began in 431 B.C. Its first stage was indecisive. The Athenians\r\navoided a conflict in the open field with the stronger Peloponnesian army,\r\nwhich ravaged Attica. They were crippled almost at the outset of the\r\nstruggle by a terrible plague among the refugees from Attica, crowded\r\nbehind the Long Walls. The pestilence slew at least one-fourth of the\r\ninhabitants of Athens, including Pericles himself. After ten years of\r\nfighting both sides grew weary of the war and made a treaty of peace to\r\nlast for fifty years.\r\n\r\nTHE SICILIAN EXPEDITION, 4l5-4l3 B.C.\r\n\r\nNot long after the conclusion of peace the Athenians were persuaded by a\r\nbrilliant and ambitious politician, named Alcibiades, to undertake an\r\nexpedition against Syracuse in Sicily. This city was a colony of Corinth,\r\nand hence was a natural ally of the Peloponnesian states. The Athenians,\r\nby conquering it, expected to establish their power in Sicily. But the\r\nsiege of Syracuse ended in a complete failure. The Athenians failed to\r\ncapture the city, and in a great naval battle they lost their fleet. Then\r\nthey tried to retreat by land, but soon had to surrender. Many of the\r\nprisoners were sold as slaves; many were thrown by their inhuman captors\r\ninto the stone quarries near Syracuse, where they perished from exposure\r\nand starvation. The Athenians, says Thucydides, \"were absolutely\r\nannihilated--both army and fleet--and of the many thousands who went away\r\nonly a handful ever saw their homes again.\" [21]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SILVER COIN OF SYRACUSE\r\nThe profile of the nymph Arethusa has been styled the most exquisite Greek\r\nhead known to us.]\r\n\r\nLAST STAGE OF THE WAR 413-404 B.C.\r\n\r\nAthens never recovered from this terrible blow. The Spartans quickly\r\nrenewed the contest, now with the highest hopes of success. The Athenians\r\nhad to guard their city against the invader night and day; their slaves\r\ndeserted to the enemy; and they themselves could do no farming except\r\nunder the walls of the city. For supplies they had to depend entirely on\r\ntheir ships. For nearly ten years, however, the Athenians kept up the\r\nstruggle. At length the Spartans captured an Athenian fleet near\r\nAegospotami on the Hellespont. Soon afterwards they blockaded Piraeus and\r\ntheir army encamped before the walls of Athens. Bitter famine compelled\r\nthe Athenians to sue for peace. The Spartans imposed harsh terms. The\r\nAthenians were obliged to destroy their Long Walls and the fortifications\r\nof Piraeus, to surrender all but twelve of their warships, and to\r\nacknowledge the supremacy of Sparta.\r\n\r\n\r\n37. THE SPARTAN AND THEBAN SUPREMACIES, 404-362 B.C.\r\n\r\nSPARTAN DESPOTISM\r\n\r\nSparta was now the undisputed leader of Continental Greece and of the\r\nAegean. As the representative of the liberty-loving Greeks she had humbled\r\nthe pride and power of \"tyrant\" Athens. A great opportunity lay before her\r\nto reorganize the Hellenic world and to end the struggles for supremacy\r\nbetween rival cities. But Sparta entered upon no such glorious career. She\r\nhad always stood as the champion of aristocracy against democracy, and now\r\nin her hour of triumph she began to overturn every democratic government\r\nthat still existed in Greece. The Greek cities soon found they had\r\nexchanged the mild sway of Athens for the brutal despotism of Sparta.\r\n\r\nTHE FREEING OF THEBES 379 B.C.\r\n\r\nBut Spartan despotism provoked resistance. It was the Boeotian city of\r\nThebes which raised the standard of revolt. Some of the liberty-loving\r\nThebans, headed by Pelopidas, a patriotic noble, formed a conspiracy to\r\ndrive the Spartans out of the city. Disguised as huntsmen, Pelopidas and\r\nhis followers entered Thebes at nightfall, killed the tyrants whom Sparta\r\nhad set over the people, and forced the Spartan garrison to surrender.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF LEUCTRA, 371 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe Thebans had now recovered their independence. Eight years later they\r\ntotally defeated a superior Peloponnesian force at the battle of Leuctra\r\nand brought the supremacy of Sparta to an end. This engagement from a\r\nmilitary standpoint is one of the most interesting in ancient history.\r\nEpaminondas, the skilful Theban commander, massed his best troops in a\r\nsolid column, fifty men deep, and hurled it with terrific force against\r\nthe Spartan ranks. The enemy, drawn up twelve men deep in the customary\r\nformation, could not withstand the impact of the Theban column; their\r\nlines gave way, and the fight was soon won. The battle destroyed once for\r\nall the legend of Spartan invincibility.\r\n\r\nPELOPIDAS AND EPAMINONDAS\r\n\r\nThe sudden rise of Thebes to the position of the first city in Greece was\r\nthe work of two men whose names are always linked together in the annals\r\nof the time. In Pelopidas and Epaminondas, bosom friends and colleagues,\r\nThebes found the heroes of her struggle for independence. Pelopidas was a\r\nfiery warrior whose bravery and daring won the hearts of his soldiers.\r\nEpaminondas was both an able general and an eminent statesman. No other\r\nGreek, save perhaps Pericles, can be compared with him. Even Pericles\r\nworked for Athens alone and showed no regard for the rest of Greece.\r\nEpaminondas had nobler ideals and sought the general good of the Hellenic\r\nrace. He fought less to destroy Sparta than to curb that city's power of\r\ndoing harm. He aimed not so much to make Thebes mistress of an empire as\r\nto give her a proper place among Greek cities. The Thebans, indeed,\r\nsometimes complained that Epaminondas loved Hellas more than his native\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF MANTINEA, 362 B.C.\r\n\r\nBy crippling Sparta, Epaminondas raised Thebes to a position of supremacy.\r\nHad he been spared for a longer service, Epaminondas might have realized\r\nhis dream of bringing unity and order into the troubled politics of his\r\ntime. But circumstances were too strong for him. The Greek states, which\r\nhad accepted the leadership of Athens and Sparta, were unwilling to admit\r\nthe claims of Thebes to a position of equal power and importance. The\r\nperiod of Theban rule was filled, therefore, with perpetual conflict. Nine\r\nyears after Leuctra Epaminondas himself fell in battle at Mantinea in the\r\nPeloponnesus, and with his death ended the brief glory of Thebes.\r\n\r\n\r\n38. DECLINE OF THE CITY-STATE\r\n\r\nWEAKNESS OF CITY-STATES\r\n\r\nThe battle of Mantinea proved that no single city--Athens, Sparta, or\r\nThebes--was strong enough to rule Greece. By the middle of the fourth\r\ncentury B.C. it had become evident that a great Hellenic power could the\r\nnot be created out of the little, independent city-states of Greece.\r\n\r\nA RECORD OF ALMOST CEASELESS CONFLICT\r\n\r\nThe history of Continental Hellas for more than a century after the close\r\nof the Persian War had been a record of almost ceaseless conflict. We have\r\nseen how Greece came to be split up into two great alliances, the one a\r\nnaval league ruled by Athens, the other a confederacy of Peloponnesian\r\ncities under the leadership of Sparta. How the Delian League became the\r\nAthenian Empire; how Sparta began a long war with Athens to secure the\r\nindependence of the subject states and ended it by reducing them to her\r\nown supremacy; how the rough-handed sway of Sparta led to the revolt of\r\nher allies and dependencies and the sudden rise of Thebes to supremacy;\r\nhow Thebes herself established an empire on the ruins of Spartan rule--\r\nthis is a story of fruitless and exhausting struggles which sounded the\r\nknell of Greek liberty and the end of the city-state.\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE\r\n\r\nFar away in the north, remote from the noisy conflicts of Greek political\r\nlife, a new power was slowly rising to imperial greatness--no\r\ninsignificant city-state, but an extensive territorial state like those of\r\nmodern times. Three years after the battle of Mantinea Philip II ascended\r\nthe throne of Macedonia. He established Hellenic unity by bringing the\r\nHellenic people within a widespread empire. Alexander the Great, the son\r\nof this king, carried Macedonian dominion and Greek culture to the ends of\r\nthe known world. To this new period of ancient history we now turn.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1. On an outline map indicate the principal places mentioned in this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n2.

[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n39. PHILIP AND THE RISE OF MACEDONIA\r\n\r\nMACEDONIA AND THE MACEDONIANS\r\n\r\nThe land of Macedonia, lying to the north of Greece, for a long time had\r\nbeen an inconspicuous part of the ancient world. Its people, though only\r\npartially civilized, were Greeks in blood and language. No doubt they\r\nformed an offshoot of those northern invaders who had entered the Balkan\r\npeninsula before the dawn of history. The Macedonian kings, from the era\r\nof the Persian wars, seized every opportunity of spreading Greek culture\r\nthroughout their realm. By the middle of the fourth century B.C., when\r\nPhilip II ascended the throne, the Macedonians were ready to take a\r\nleading place in the Greek world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILIP II\r\nFrom a gold medallion struck by Alexander]\r\n\r\nPHILIP'S AIMS\r\n\r\nPhilip of Macedonia, one of the most remarkable men of antiquity, was\r\nendowed with a vigorous body, a keen mind, and a resolute will. He was no\r\nstranger to Greece and its ways. Part of his boyhood had been passed as a\r\nhostage at Thebes in the days of Theban glory. His residence there gave\r\nhim an insight into Greek politics and taught him the art of war as it had\r\nbeen perfected by Epaminondas. In the distracted condition of Greece, worn\r\nout by the rivalries of contending cities, Philip saw the opportunity of\r\nhis own country. He aimed to secure for Macedonia the position of\r\nsupremacy which neither Athens, Sparta, nor Thebes had been able to\r\nmaintain.\r\n\r\nTHE MACEDONIAN ARMY\r\n\r\nPhilip's most important achievement was the creation of the Macedonian\r\narmy, which he led to the conquest of Greece and which his son was to lead\r\nto the conquest of the World. Taking a hint from the tactics of\r\nEpaminondas, Philip trained his infantry to fight by columns, but with\r\nsufficient intervals between the files to permit quick and easy movements.\r\nEach man bore an enormous lance, eighteen feet in length. When this heavy\r\nphalanx was set in array, the weapons carried by the soldiers in the first\r\nfive ranks presented a bristling thicket of lance-points, which no onset,\r\nhowever determined, could penetrate. The business of the phalanx was to\r\nkeep the front of the foe engaged, while horsemen rode into the enemy's\r\nflanks. This reliance on masses of cavalry to win a victory was something\r\nnew in warfare. Another novel feature consisted in the use of engines\r\ncalled catapults, able to throw darts and huge stones three hundred yards,\r\nand of battering rams with force enough to hurl down the walls of cities.\r\nAll these different arms working together made a war machine of tremendous\r\npower--the most formidable in the ancient world until the days of the\r\nRoman legion.\r\n\r\nCONQUESTS OF PHILIP\r\n\r\nPhilip commanded a fine army; he ruled with absolute sway a territory\r\nlarger than any other Hellenic state; and he himself possessed a genius\r\nfor both war and diplomacy, With such advantages the Macedonian king\r\nentered on the subjugation of disunited Greece. His first great success\r\nwas won in western Thrace. Here he founded the city of Philippi [2] and\r\nseized some rich gold mines, the income from which enabled him to keep his\r\nsoldiers always under arms, to fit out a fleet, and, by means of liberal\r\nbribes, to hire a crowd of agents in nearly every Greek city. Philip next\r\nmade Macedonia a maritime state by subduing the Greek cities on the\r\npeninsula of Chalcidice. [3] He also appeared in Thessaly, occupied its\r\nprincipal fortresses, and brought the frontier of Macedonia as far south\r\nas the pass of Thermopylae.\r\n\r\n\r\n40. DEMOSTHENES AND THE END OF GREEK FREEDOM\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES, 384-322 B.C.\r\n\r\nPhilip for many years had been steadily extending his sway over Greece. In\r\nthe face of his encroachments would Athens, Sparta, and Thebes, so long\r\nthe leading cities, submit tamely to this Macedonian conqueror? There was\r\none man, at least, who realized the menace to Greek freedom from Philip's\r\nonward march. In Demosthenes Greece found a champion of her threatened\r\nliberties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEMOSTHENES (Vatican Museum, Rome)\r\nA marble statue, probably a copy of the bronze original by the sculptor\r\nPolyeuctus. The work, when found, was considerably mutilated and has been\r\nrestored in numerous parts. Both forearms and the hands holding the scroll\r\nare modern additions. It seems likely that the original Athenian statue\r\nshowed Demosthenes with tightly clasped hands, which, with his furrowed\r\nvisage and contracted brows, were expressive of the orator's earnestness\r\nand concentration of thought.]\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES AS AN ORATOR AND A PATRIOT\r\n\r\nDemosthenes was the last, as well as the most famous, of the great\r\nAthenian orators. When he first began to speak, the citizens laughed at\r\nhis long, involved sentences, over-rapid delivery, and awkward bearing.\r\nFriends encouraged him to persist, assuring him that, if the manner of his\r\nspeeches was bad, their matter was worthy of Pericles. Numerous stories\r\nare told of the efforts made by Demosthenes to overcome his natural\r\ndefects. He practiced gesturing before a mirror and, to correct a\r\nstammering pronunciation, recited verses with pebbles in his mouth. He\r\nwould go down to the seashore during storms and strive to make his voice\r\nheard above the roar of wind and waves, in order the better to face the\r\nboisterous Assembly. Before long he came to be regarded as the prince of\r\nspeakers even in the city of orators. Demosthenes was a man cast in the\r\nold heroic mold. His patriotic imagination had been fired by the great\r\ndeeds once accomplished by free Greeks. Athens he loved with passionate\r\ndevotion. Let her remember her ancient glories, he urged, and, by\r\nwithstanding Philip, become the leader of Hellas in a second war for\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nLAST STRUGGLE OF THE GREEKS\r\n\r\nThe stirring appeals of the great orator at first had little effect. There\r\nwere many friends of Philip in the Greek states, even in Athens itself.\r\nWhen, however, Philip entered central Greece and threatened the\r\nindependence of its cities, the eloquence of Demosthenes met a readier\r\nresponse. In the presence of the common danger Thebes and Athens gave up\r\ntheir ancient rivalry and formed a defensive alliance against Philip. Had\r\nit been joined by Sparta and the other Peloponnesian states, it is\r\npossible that their united power might have hurled back the invader. But\r\nthey held aloof.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF CHAERONEA, 338 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe decisive battle was fought at Chaeronea in Boeotia. On that fatal\r\nfield the well-drilled and seasoned troops of Macedonia, headed by a\r\nmaster of the art of war, overcame the citizen levies of Greece. The\r\nGreeks fought bravely, as of old, and their defeat was not inglorious.\r\nNear the modern town of Chaeronea the traveler can still see the tomb\r\nwhere the fallen heroes were laid, and the marble lion set up as a\r\nmemorial to their dauntless struggle.\r\n\r\nPHILIP'S POLICY AS A CONQUEROR\r\n\r\nChaeronea gave Philip the undisputed control of Greece. But now that\r\nvictory was assured, he had no intention of playing the tyrant. He\r\ncompelled Thebes to admit a Macedonian garrison to her citadel, but\r\ntreated Athens so mildly that the citizens were glad to conclude with him\r\na peace which left their possessions untouched. Philip entered the\r\nPeloponnesus as a liberator. Its towns and cities welcomed an alliance\r\nwith so powerful a protector against Sparta.\r\n\r\nCONGRESS AT CORINTH, 337 B.C.\r\n\r\nHaving completely realized his design of establishing Macedonian rule over\r\nGreece, Philip's restless energy drove him forward to the next step in his\r\nambitious program. He determined to carry out the plans, so long cherished\r\nby the Greeks, for an invasion of Asia Minor and, perhaps, of Persia\r\nitself. In the year 337 B.C. a congress of all the Hellenic states met at\r\nCorinth under Philip's presidency. The delegates voted to supply ships and\r\nmen for the great undertaking and placed Philip in command of the allied\r\nforces. A Macedonian king was to be the captain-general of Hellas.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF PHILIP, 336 B.C.\r\n\r\nBut Philip was destined never to lead an army across the Hellespont. Less\r\nthan two years after Chaeronea he was killed by an assassin, and the\r\nscepter passed to his young son, Alexander.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDER (Glyptothek, Munich)\r\nProbably an authentic portrait of the youthful Alexander about 338 B.C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n41. ALEXANDER THE GREAT\r\n\r\nTHE YOUTHFUL ALEXANDER\r\n\r\nAlexander was only twenty years of age when he became ruler of Macedonia.\r\nFrom his father he inherited the powerful Frame, the kingly figure, the\r\nmasterful will, which made so deep an impression on all his\r\ncontemporaries. His mother, a proud and ambitious woman, told him that the\r\nblood of Achilles ran in his veins, and bade him emulate the deeds of that\r\nnational hero. We know that he learned the _Iliad_ by heart and always\r\ncarried a copy of it on his campaigns. As he came to manhood, Alexander\r\ndeveloped into a splendid athlete, skillful in all the sports of his\r\nrough-riding companions, and trained in every warlike exercise.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION OF ALEXANDER BY ARISTOTLE\r\n\r\nPhilip believed that in Alexander he had a worthy son, for he persuaded\r\nAristotle, [4] the most learned man in Greece, to become the tutor of the\r\nyoung prince. The influence of that philosopher remained with Alexander\r\nthroughout life. Aristotle taught him to love Greek art and science, and\r\ninstilled into his receptive mind an admiration for all things Grecian.\r\nAlexander used to say that, while he owed his life to his father, he owed\r\nto Aristotle the knowledge of how to live worthily.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER CRUSHES REBELLION\r\n\r\nThe situation which Alexander faced on his accession might well have\r\ndismayed a less dauntless spirit. Philip had not lived long enough to\r\nunite firmly his wide dominions. His unexpected death proved the signal\r\nfor uprisings and disorder. The barbarous Thracians broke out in\r\nwidespread rebellion, and the Greeks made ready to answer the call of\r\nDemosthenes to arms. But Alexander soon set his kingdom in order. After\r\ncrushing the tribes of Thrace, he descended on Greece and besieged Thebes,\r\nwhich had risen against its Macedonian garrison. The city was soon\r\ncaptured; its inhabitants were slaughtered or sold into slavery; and the\r\nplace itself was destroyed. The terrible fate of Thebes induced the other\r\nstates to submit without further resistance.\r\n\r\nSEEMING STRENGTH OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\nWith Greece pacified, Alexander could proceed to the invasion of Persia.\r\nSince the days of Darius the Great the empire had remained almost intact--\r\na huge, loosely-knit collection of many different peoples, whose sole bond\r\nof union was their common allegiance to the Great King. [5] Its resources\r\nwere enormous. There were millions of men for the armies and untold wealth\r\nin the royal treasuries. Yet the empire was a hollow shell.\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION OF THE \"TEN THOUSAND,\" 401-400 B.C.\r\n\r\nSome seventy years before Alexander set forth on his expedition the Greeks\r\nhad witnessed a remarkable disclosure of the military weakness of Persia.\r\nOne of those rare revolts which troubled the security of the Persian\r\nEmpire broke out in Asia Minor. It was headed by Cyrus the Younger, a\r\nbrother of the Persian monarch. Cyrus gathered a large body of native\r\ntroops and also hired about ten thousand Greek soldiers. He led this mixed\r\nforce into the heart of the Persian dominions, only to fall in battle at\r\nCunaxa, near Babylon. The Greeks easily routed the enemy arrayed against\r\nthem, but the death of Cyrus made their victory fruitless. In spite of\r\ntheir desperate situation the Greeks refused to surrender and started to\r\nreturn homewards. The Persians dogged their footsteps, yet never ventured\r\non a pitched battle. After months of wandering in Assyria and Armenia the\r\nlittle band of intrepid soldiers finally reached Trapezus, (Modern\r\nTrebizond) a Greek city on the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, ROUTE OF THE TEN THOUSAND]\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE EXPEDITION\r\n\r\nThe story of this invasion of Persia and the subsequent retreat was\r\nwritten by the Athenian Xenophon [6] in his _Anabasis_. It is one of the\r\nmost interesting books that have come down to us from antiquity. We can\r\njudge from it how vivid was the impression which the adventures of the\r\n\"Ten Thousand\" made on the Greeks of Xenophon's time. A small army had\r\nmarched to the center of the Persian dominions, had overcome a host many\r\ntimes its size, and had returned to Greece in safety. It was clear proof\r\nthat the Persian power, however imposing on the outside, could offer no\r\neffective resistance to an attack by a strong force of disciplined Greek\r\nsoldiers. Henceforth the Greeks never abandoned the idea of an invasion of\r\nPersia.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER'S INVASION\r\n\r\nThe gigantic task fell, however, to Alexander, as the champion of Hellas\r\nagainst the \"barbarians.\" With an army of less than forty thousand men\r\nAlexander destroyed an empire before which, for two centuries, all Asia\r\nhad been wont to tremble. History, ancient or modern, contains no other\r\nrecord of conquests so widespread, so thorough, so amazingly rapid.\r\n\r\n\r\n42. CONQUEST OF PERSIA AND THE FAR EAST, 334-323 B.C.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE GRANICUS, 334 B.C.\r\n\r\nAlexander crossed the Hellespont in the spring of the year 334 B.C. He\r\nlanded not far from the historic plain of Troy and at once began his march\r\nalong the coast. Near the little river Granicus the satraps of Asia Minor\r\nhad gathered an army to dispute his passage. Alexander at once led his\r\ncavalry across the river in an impetuous charge, which soon sent the\r\nPersian troops in headlong flight. The victory cost the Macedonians\r\nscarcely a hundred men; but it was complete. As Alexander passed\r\nsouthward, town after town opened its gates--first Sardis, next Ephesus,\r\nthen all the other cities of Ionia. They were glad enough to be free of\r\nPersian control. Within a year Asia Minor was a Macedonian possession.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF ISSUS, 333 B.C.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Darius III, the Persian king, had been making extensive\r\npreparations to meet the invader. He commanded half a million men, but he\r\nfollowed Alexander too hastily and had to fight in a narrow defile on the\r\nSyrian coast between the mountains and the sea. In such cramped quarters\r\nnumbers did not count. The battle became a massacre, and only the approach\r\nof night stayed the swords of the victorious Macedonians. A great quantity\r\nof booty, including the mother, wife, and children of Darius, fell into\r\nAlexander's hands. He treated his royal captives kindly, but refused to\r\nmake peace with the Persian king.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ALEXANDER MOSAIC (Naples Museum)\r\nThis splendid mosaic composed of pieces of colored glass formed the\r\npavement of a Roman house at Pompeii in Italy. It represents the charge of\r\nAlexander (on horseback at the left) against the Persian king in his\r\nchariot, at the battle of Issus.]\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF TYRE, 332 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to subdue the Phoenician city of Tyre, the headquarters\r\nof Persia's naval power. The city lay on a rocky island, half a mile from\r\nthe shore. Its fortifications rose one hundred feet above the waves.\r\nAlthough the place seemed impregnable, Alexander was able to capture it\r\nafter he had built a mole, or causeway, between the shore and the island.\r\nPowerful siege engines then breached the walls, the Macedonians poured in,\r\nand Tyre fell by storm. Thousands of its inhabitants perished and\r\nthousands more were sold into slavery. The great emporium of the East\r\nbecame a heap of ruins.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER IN EGYPT\r\n\r\nFrom Tyre Alexander led his ever-victorious army through Syria into Egypt.\r\nThe Persian forces here offered little resistance, and the Egyptians\r\nthemselves welcomed Alexander as a deliverer. The conqueror entered\r\nMemphis in triumph and then sailed down the Nile to its western mouth,\r\nwhere he laid the foundations of Alexandria, a city which later became the\r\nmetropolis of the Orient.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER IN LIBYA\r\n\r\nAnother march brought Alexander to the borders of Libya, Here he received\r\nthe submission of Cyrene, the most important Greek colony in Africa. [7]\r\nAlexander's dominions were thus extended to the border of the Carthaginian\r\npossessions. It was at this time that Alexander visited a celebrated\r\ntemple of the god Amon, located in an oasis of the Libyan desert. The\r\npriests were ready enough to hail him as a son of Amon, as one before whom\r\nhis Egyptian subjects might bow down and adore. But after Alexander's\r\ndeath his worship spread widely over the world, and even the Roman Senate\r\ngave him a place among the gods of Olympus.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF ARBELA, 331 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe time had now come to strike directly at the Persian king. Following\r\nthe ancient trade routes through northern Mesopotamia, Alexander crossed\r\nthe Euphrates and the Tigris and, on a broad plain not far from the ruins\r\nof ancient Nineveh, [8] found himself confronted by the Persian host.\r\nDarius held an excellent position and hoped to crush his foe by sheer\r\nweight of numbers. But nothing could stop the Macedonian onset; once more\r\nDarius fled away, and once more the Persians, deserted by their king,\r\nbroke up in hopeless rout.\r\n\r\nEND OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\nThe battle of Arbela decided the fate of the Persian Empire. It remained\r\nonly to gather the fruits of victory. The city of Babylon surrendered\r\nwithout a struggle. Susa, with its enormous treasure, fell into the\r\nconqueror's hands. Persepolis, the old Persian capital, was given up to\r\nfire and sword. [9] Darius himself, as he retreated eastward, was murdered\r\nby his own men. With the death of Darius the national war of Greece\r\nagainst Persia came to an end.\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF IRAN\r\n\r\nThe Macedonians had now overrun all the Persian provinces except distant\r\nIran and India. These countries were peopled of by warlike tribes of a\r\nvery different stamp from the effeminate Persians. Alexander might well\r\nhave been content to leave them undisturbed, but the man could never rest\r\nwhile there were still conquests to be made. Long marches and much hard\r\nfighting were necessary to subdue the tribes about the Caspian and the\r\ninhabitants of the countries now known as Afghanistan and Turkestan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, EMPIRE OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT About 323 B.C.]\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF INDIA\r\n\r\nCrossing the lofty barrier of the Hindu-Kush, Alexander led his weary\r\nsoldiers into northwestern India, where a single battle added the Persian\r\nprovince of the Punjab [10] to the Macedonian possessions. Alexander then\r\npressed forward to the conquest of the Ganges valley, but in the full tide\r\nof victory his troops refused to go any farther. They had had their fill\r\nof war and martial glory; they would conquer no more lands for their\r\nambitious king. Alexander gave with reluctance the order for the homeward\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER'S RETURN TO BABYLON\r\n\r\nAlexander was of too adventurous a disposition to return by the way he had\r\ncome. He resolved to reach Babylon by a new route. He built a navy on the\r\nIndus and had it accompany the army down the river. At the mouth of the\r\nIndus Alexander dispatched the fleet under his admiral, Nearchus, to\r\nexplore the Indian Ocean and to discover, if possible, a sea route between\r\nIndia and the West. He himself led the army, by a long and toilsome march\r\nthrough the deserts of southern Iran, to Babylon. That city now became the\r\ncapital of the Macedonian Empire.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF ALEXANDER, 323 B.C.\r\n\r\nScarcely two years after his return, while he was planning yet more\r\nextensive conquests in Arabia, Africa, and western Europe, he was smitten\r\nby the deadly Babylonian fever. In 323 B.C., after several days of\r\nillness, the conqueror of the world passed away, being not quite thirty-\r\nthree years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n43. THE WORK OF ALEXANDER\r\n\r\nALEXANDER AS WARRIOR AND STATESMAN\r\n\r\nAlexander the Great was one of the foremost, perhaps the first, of the\r\ngreat captains of antiquity. But he was more than a world-conqueror; he\r\nwas a statesman of the highest order. Had he been spared for an ordinary\r\nlifetime, there is no telling how much he might have accomplished. In\r\neleven years he had been able to subdue the East and to leave an impress\r\nupon it which was to endure for centuries. And yet his work had only\r\nbegun. There were still lands to conquer, cities to build, untrodden\r\nregions to explore. Above all, it was still his task to shape his\r\npossessions into a well-knit, unified empire, which would not fall to\r\npieces in the hands of his successors. His early death was a calamity, for\r\nit prevented the complete realization of his splendid ambitions.\r\n\r\nHELLENIZING OF THE ORIENT\r\n\r\nThe immediate result of Alexander's conquests was the disappearance of the\r\nbarriers which had so long shut in the Orient. The East, until his day,\r\nwas an almost unknown land. Now it lay open to the spread of Greek\r\ncivilization. In the wake of the Macedonian armies followed Greek\r\nphilosophers and scientists, Greek architects and artists, Greek\r\ncolonists, merchants, and artisans. Everywhere into that huge, inert,\r\nunprogressive Oriental world came the active and enterprising men of\r\nHellas. They brought their arts and culture and became the teachers of\r\nthose whom they had called \"barbarians.\"\r\n\r\nFUSION OF EAST AND WEST\r\n\r\nThe ultimate result of Alexander's conquests was the fusion of East and\r\nWest. He realized that his new empire must contain a place for Oriental,\r\nas well as for Greek and East and Macedonian, subjects. It was Alexander's\r\naim, therefore, to build up a new state in which the distinction between\r\nthe European and the Asiatic should gradually pass away. He welcomed\r\nPersian nobles to his court and placed them in positions of trust. He\r\norganized the government of his provinces on a system resembling that of\r\nDarius the Great. [11] He trained thousands of Persian soldiers to replace\r\nthe worn-out veterans in his armies. He encouraged by liberal dowries\r\nmixed marriages between Macedonians and Orientals, and himself wedded the\r\ndaughter of the last Persian king. To hold his dominions together and\r\nprovide a meeting place for both classes of his subjects, he founded no\r\nless than seventy cities in different parts of the empire. Such measures\r\nas these show that Alexander had a mind of wide, even cosmopolitan,\r\nsympathies. They indicate the loss which ancient civilization suffered by\r\nhis untimely end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SARCOPHAGUS FROM SIDON (Imperial Ottoman Museum,\r\nConstantinople.)\r\n\r\nOne of eighteen splendid sarcophagi discovered in 1887 A.D. in an ancient\r\ncemetery at Sidon. The sculptures on the longer sides represent two scenes\r\nfrom the life of Alexander--the one a battle, the other a lion hunt. The\r\nfigures, in almost full relief, are delicately painted. ]\r\n\r\n\r\n44. HELLENISTIC KINGDOMS AND CITIES\r\n\r\nTHE THREE GREAT KINGDOMS\r\n\r\nThe half century following Alexander's death is a confused and troubled\r\nperiod in ancient history. The king had left no legitimate son--no one\r\nwith an undisputed title to the succession. On his deathbed Alexander had\r\nhimself declared that the realm should go \"to the strongest.\" [12] It was\r\ncertain, under these circumstances, that his possessions would become the\r\nprey of the leading Macedonian generals. The unwieldy empire at length\r\nbroke in pieces. Out of the fragments arose three great states, namely,\r\nMacedonia, Egypt, and Syria. The kingdom of Egypt was ruled by Ptolemy,\r\none of Alexander's generals. Seleucus, another of his generals,\r\nestablished the kingdom of Syria. It comprised nearly all western Asia.\r\nThese kingdoms remained independent until the era of Roman conquest in the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GREEK CAMEO (Museum, Vienna)\r\nCut in sardonyx. Represents Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, and his\r\nwife Arsinoë.]\r\n\r\nMINOR INDEPENDENT STATES\r\n\r\nSeveral small states also arose from the break-up of Alexander's empire.\r\n[13] Each had its royal dynasty, its capital city, and its own national\r\nlife. Thus the conquests of Alexander, instead of establishing a world-\r\npower under one ruler, led to the destruction of the unity of government\r\nwhich Persia had given to the East.\r\n\r\nCITY LIFE IN THE ORIENT\r\n\r\nMore significant for the history of civilization than these kingdoms were\r\nthe Hellenistic [14] cities, which from the time of Alexander arose in\r\nevery part of the eastern world. Some were only garrison towns in the\r\nheart of remote provinces or outposts along the frontiers. Many more,\r\nhowever, formed busy centers of trade and industry, and became seats of\r\nGreek influence in the Orient. Such cities were quite unlike the old Greek\r\ncity-states. [15] They were not free and independent, but made a part of\r\nthe kingdom in which they were situated. The inhabitants consisted of\r\nGreeks and Macedonians, comprising the governing class, together with\r\nnative artisans and merchants who had abandoned their village homes for\r\nlife in a metropolis. In appearance, also, these cities contrasted with\r\nthose of old Greece. They had broad streets, well paved and sometimes\r\nlighted at night, enjoyed a good water supply, and possessed baths,\r\ntheaters, and parks.\r\n\r\nALEXANDRIA\r\n\r\nIn the third century B.C. the foremost Hellenistic city was Alexandria. It\r\nlay on a strip of flat, sandy land separating Lake Mareotis from the\r\nMediterranean. On the one side was the lake-harbor, connected with the\r\nNile; on the other side were two sea-harbors, sheltered from the open sea\r\nby the long and narrow island of Pharos. [16] The city possessed a\r\nmagnificent site for commerce. It occupied the most central position that\r\ncould be found in the ancient world with respect to the three continents,\r\nAfrica, Asia, and Europe. The prosperity which this port has enjoyed for\r\nmore than two thousand years is ample evidence of the wisdom which led to\r\nits foundation.\r\n\r\nANTIOCH\r\n\r\nThe chief city in the kingdom of Syria was splendid and luxurious Antioch.\r\nIt lay in the narrow valley of the Orontes River, so close to both the\r\nEuphrates and the Mediterranean that it soon became an important\r\ncommercial center. The city must have been a most delightful residence,\r\nwith its fine climate, its location on a clear and rapid stream, and the\r\nnear presence of the Syrian hills. In the sixth century A.D. repeated\r\nearthquakes laid Antioch in ruins. The city never recovered its\r\nprosperity, though a modern town, Antakia, still marks the site of the\r\nonce famous capital.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, THE KINGDOMS OF ALEXANDER'S SUCCESSORS (About 200\r\nB.C.), Before the Roman Macedonian Wars]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DYING GAUL (Capitoline Museum, Rome)\r\nThe statue represents a Gaul who in battle has fallen on his sword to\r\navoid a shameful captivity. Overcome by the faintness of death he sinks\r\nupon his shield, his head dropping heavily forward. Though realistic the\r\nstatue shows nothing violent or revolting. It is a tragedy in stone.]\r\n\r\nPERGAMUM\r\n\r\nAsia Minor, during this period, contained many Hellenistic cities. One of\r\nthe most important was Pergamum, the capital of a small but independent\r\nkingdom of the same name. Its rulers earned the gratitude of all the\r\nGreeks by their resistance to the terrible Gauls. About fifty years after\r\nAlexander's death this barbarous people, pouring down from central Europe,\r\nhad ravaged Greece and invaded Asia Minor. The kings of Pergamum\r\ncelebrated their victories over the Gauls with so many works of\r\narchitecture and sculpture that their city became the artistic rival of\r\nAthens.\r\n\r\nRHODES\r\n\r\nOne other great Hellenistic center existed in the island city of Rhodes.\r\nFounded during the closing years of the Peloponnesian War, Rhodes soon\r\ndistanced Athens in the race for commercial supremacy. The merchants of\r\nRhodes framed admirable laws, especially for business affairs, and many of\r\nthese were incorporated in the Roman code. Rhodes was celebrated for art.\r\nNo less than three thousand statues adorned the streets and public\r\nbuildings. It was also a favorite place of education for promising orators\r\nand writers. During Roman days many eminent men, Cicero and Julius Caesar\r\namong them, studied oratory at Rhodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n45. THE HELLENISTIC AGE\r\n\r\nHELLENISTIC LITERATURE\r\n\r\nThese splendid cities in the Orient were the centers of much literary\r\nactivity. Their inhabitants, whether Hellenic or \"barbarian,\" used Greek\r\nas a common language. During this period Greek literature took on a\r\ncosmopolitan character. It no longer centered in Athens. Writers found\r\ntheir audiences in all lands where Greeks had settled. At the same time\r\nliterature became more and more an affair of the study. The authors were\r\nusually professional bookmen writing for a bookish public. They produced\r\nmany works of literary criticism, prepared excellent grammars and\r\ndictionaries, but wrote very little poetry or prose of enduring value.\r\n\r\nTHE MUSEUM AT ALEXANDRIA\r\n\r\nThe Hellenistic Age was distinguished as an age of learning. Particularly\r\nwas this true at Alexandria, where the Museum, founded by the first\r\nMacedonian king of Egypt, became a real university. It contained galleries\r\nof art, an astronomical observatory, and even zoological and botanical\r\ngardens. The Museum formed a resort for men of learning, who had the\r\nleisure necessary for scholarly research. The beautiful gardens, with\r\ntheir shady walks, statues, and fountains, were the haunt of thousands of\r\nstudents whom the fame of Alexandria attracted from all parts of the\r\ncivilized world.\r\n\r\nTHE ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Museum there was a splendid library, which at one time\r\ncontained over five hundred thousand manuscripts--almost everything that\r\nhad been written in antiquity. The chief librarian ransacked private\r\ncollections and purchased all the books he could find. Every book that\r\nentered Egypt was brought to the Library, where slaves transcribed the\r\nmanuscript and gave a copy to the owner in place of the original. Before\r\nthis time the manuscripts of celebrated works were often scarce and always\r\nin danger of being lost. Henceforth it was known where to look for them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAOCOON AND HIS CHILDREN (Vatican Museum Rome)\r\nA product of the art school of Rhodes (about 150 B.C.).

The goddess of Victory was probably represented holding a\r\ntrumpet to her lips with her right hand. The fresh ocean breeze has blown\r\nher garments back into tumultuous folds.]\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES\r\n\r\nThe Hellenistic Age was remarkable for the rapid advance of scientific\r\nknowledge. Most of the mathematical works of the Greeks date from this\r\nepoch. Euclid wrote a treatise on geometry which still holds its place in\r\nthe schools. Archimedes of Syracuse, who had once studied at Alexandria,\r\nmade many discoveries in engineering. A water screw of his device is still\r\nin use. He has the credit for finding out the laws of the lever. \"Give me\r\na fulcrum on which to rest,\" he said, \"and I will move the earth.\" The\r\nHellenistic scholars also made remarkable progress in medicine. The\r\nmedical school of Alexandria was well equipped with charts, models, and\r\ndissecting rooms for the study of the human body. During the second\r\ncentury of our era all the medical knowledge of antiquity was gathered up\r\nin the writings of Galen (born about 130 A.D.). For more than a thousand\r\nyears Galen of Pergamum remained the supreme authority in medicine.\r\n\r\nANCIENT AND MODERN SCIENCE COMPARED\r\n\r\nIn scientific work it seems as if the Greeks had done almost all that\r\ncould be accomplished by sheer brain power aided only by rude instruments.\r\nThey had no real telescopes or microscopes, no mariner's compass or\r\nchronometer, and no very delicate balances. Without such inventions the\r\nGreeks could hardly proceed much farther with their researches. Modern\r\nscientists are perhaps no better thinkers than were those of antiquity,\r\nbut they have infinitely better apparatus and can make careful experiments\r\nwhere the Greeks had to rely on shrewd guesses.\r\n\r\nEXTENSION OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE\r\n\r\nDuring the Hellenistic Age men began to gain more accurate ideas regarding\r\nthe shape and size of the habitable globe. Such events as the expedition\r\nof the \"Ten Thousand\" [17] and Alexander's conquests in central Asia and\r\nIndia brought new information about the countries and peoples of the\r\nOrient. During Alexander's lifetime a Greek named Pytheas, starting from\r\nMassilia, [18] made an adventurous voyage along the shores of Spain and\r\nGaul and spent some time in Britain. He was probably the first Greek to\r\nvisit that island.\r\n\r\nERATOSTHENES, ABOUT 276-194 B.C.\r\n\r\nAll this new knowledge of East and West was soon gathered together by\r\nEratosthenes, the learned librarian of Alexandria. He was the founder of\r\nscientific geography. Before his time some students had already concluded\r\nthat the earth is spherical and not flat, as had been taught in the\r\nHomeric poems. [19] Guesses had even been made of the size of the earth.\r\nEratosthenes by careful measurements came within a few thousand miles of\r\nits actual circumference. Having estimated the size of the earth,\r\nEratosthenes went on to determine how large was its habitable area. He\r\nreached the conclusion that the distance from the strait of Gibraltar to\r\nthe east of India was about one-third of the earth's circumference. The\r\nremaining two-thirds, he thought, was covered by the sea. And with what\r\nseems a prophecy he remarked that, if it was not for the vast extent of\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean, one might almost sail from Spain to India along the\r\nsame parallel of latitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROGRESS OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE IN ANTIQUITY\r\n  Map, The World according to Eratosthenes, 200 B.C.\r\n  Map, The World according to Ptolemy, 150 A.D.]\r\n\r\nPTOLEMY\r\n\r\nThe next two centuries after Eratosthenes saw the spread of Roman rule\r\nover Greeks and Carthaginians in the Mediterranean and over the barbarous\r\ninhabitants of Gaul, Britain, and Germany. The new knowledge thus gained\r\nwas summed up in the Greek _Geography_ by Ptolemy [20] of Alexandria. His\r\nfamous map shows how near he came to the real outlines both of Europe and\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nTHE PTOLEMAIC SYSTEM\r\n\r\nPtolemy was likewise an eminent astronomer. He believed that the earth was\r\nthe center of the universe and that the sun, planets, and fixed stars all\r\nrevolved around it. This Ptolemaic system was not overthrown until the\r\ngrand discovery of Copernicus in the sixteenth century of our era.\r\n\r\n\r\n46. THE GRAECO-ORIENTAL WORLD\r\n\r\nTHE NEW LUXURY\r\n\r\nThe Hellenistic Age was characterized by a general increase in wealth. The\r\nold Greeks and Macedonians, as a rule, had been content to live plainly.\r\nNow kings, nobles, and rich men began to build splendid palaces and to\r\nfill them with the products of ancient art--marbles from Asia Minor, vases\r\nfrom Athens, Italian bronzes, and Babylonian tapestries. They kept up\r\ngreat households with endless lords in waiting, ladies of honor, pages,\r\nguards, and servants. Soft couches and clothes of delicate fabric replaced\r\nthe simple coverlets and coarse cloaks of an earlier time. They possessed\r\nrich carpets and hangings, splendid armor and jewelry, and gold and silver\r\nvessels for the table. The Greeks thus began to imitate the luxurious\r\nlives of Persian nobles.\r\n\r\nTHE SEA ROUTE TO INDIA\r\n\r\nThese new luxuries flowed in from all parts of the ancient world. Many\r\ncame from the Far East in consequence of the rediscovery of the sea route\r\nto India, by Alexander's admiral, Nearchus. [21] The voyage of Nearchus\r\nwas one of the most important results of Alexander's eastern conquests. It\r\nestablished the fact, which had long been forgotten, that one could reach\r\nIndia by a water route much shorter and safer than the caravan roads\r\nthrough central Asia. [22] Somewhat later a Greek sailor, named Harpalus,\r\nfound that by using the monsoons, the periodic winds which blow over the\r\nIndian Ocean, he could sail direct from Arabia to India without\r\nlaboriously following the coast. The Greeks, in consequence, gave his name\r\nto the monsoons.\r\n\r\nORIENTAL INFLUENCE ON THE GREEKS\r\n\r\nAll this sudden increase of wealth, all the thousand new enjoyments with\r\nwhich life was now adorned and enriched, did not work wholly for good.\r\nWith luxury there went, as always, laxity in morals. Contact with the vice\r\nand effeminacy of the East tended to lessen the manly vigor of the Greeks,\r\nboth in Asia and in Europe. Hellas became corrupt, and she in turn\r\ncorrupted Rome.\r\n\r\nGREEK INFLUENCE ON THE ORIENT\r\n\r\nYet the most interesting, as well as the most important, feature of the\r\nage is the diffusion of Hellenic culture--the \"Hellenizing\" of the Orient.\r\nIt was, indeed, a changed world in which men were now living. Greek\r\ncities, founded by Alexander and his successors, stretched from the Nile\r\nto the Indus, dotted the shores of the Black Sea and Caspian, and arose\r\namid the wilds of central Asia. The Greek language, once the tongue of a\r\npetty people, grew to be a universal language of culture, spoken even by\r\n\"barbarian\" lips. And the art, the science, the literature, the principles\r\nof politics and philosophy, developed in isolation by the Greek mind,\r\nhenceforth became the heritage of many nations.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW COSMOPOLITANISM\r\n\r\nThus, in the period after Alexander the long struggle between East and\r\nWest reached a peaceful conclusion. The distinction between Greek and\r\nBarbarian gradually faded away, and the ancient world became ever more\r\nunified in sympathies and aspirations. It was this mingled civilization of\r\nOrient and Occident with which the Romans were now to come in contact, as\r\nthey pushed their conquering arms beyond Italy into the eastern\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORIENTAL, GREEK, AND ROMAN COINS\r\n  1.

[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n47. ITALY AND SICILY\r\n\r\nTHE APENNINES\r\n\r\nThe shape of Italy is determined by the course of the Apennines. Branching\r\noff from the Alps at the gulf of Genoa, these mountains cross the\r\npeninsula in an easterly direction, almost to the Adriatic. Here they turn\r\nsharply to the southeast and follow the coast for a considerable distance.\r\nThe plains of central Italy, in consequence, are all on the western slope\r\nof the Apennines. In the lower part of the peninsula the range swerves\r\nsuddenly to the southwest, so that the level land is there on the eastern\r\nside of the mountains. Near the southern extremity of Italy the Apennines\r\nseparate into two branches, which penetrate the \"heel and toe\" of the\r\npeninsula.\r\n\r\nDIVISIONS OF ITALY\r\n\r\nItaly may be conveniently divided into a northern, a central, and a\r\nsouthern section. These divisions, however, are determined by the\r\ndirection of the mountains and not, as in Greece, chiefly by inlets of the\r\nsea. Northern Italy contains the important region known in ancient times\r\nas Cisalpine Gaul. This is a perfectly level plain two hundred miles in\r\nlength, watered by the Po (_Padus_), which the Romans called the \"king of\r\nrivers,\" because of its length and many tributary streams. Central Italy,\r\nlying south of the Apennines, includes seven districts, of which the three\r\non the western coast--Etruria, Latium, and Campania--were most conspicuous\r\nin ancient history. Southern Italy, because of its warm climate and deeply\r\nindented coast, early attracted many Greek colonists. Their colonies here\r\ncame to be known as Magna Graecia, or Great Greece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, ANCIENT ITALY AND SICILY.]\r\n\r\nSICILY\r\n\r\nThe triangular-shaped island of Sicily is separated from Italy by the\r\nstrait of Messina, a channel which, at the narrowest part, is only two\r\nmiles wide. At one time Sicily must have been joined to the mainland. Its\r\nmountains, which rise at their highest point in the majestic volcano of\r\nAetna, nearly eleven thousand feet above sea level, are a continuation of\r\nthose of Italy. The greater part of Sicily is remarkably productive,\r\ncontaining rich grainfields and hillsides green with the olive and the\r\nvine. Lying in the center of the Mediterranean and in the direct route of\r\nmerchants and colonists from every direction, Sicily has always been a\r\nmeeting place of nations. In antiquity Greeks, Carthaginians, and Romans\r\ncontended for the possession of this beautiful island.\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nOn Italian history, as on that of Greece, [2] we are able to trace the\r\nprofound influence of geographical conditions. In the first place, the\r\npeninsula of Italy is not cut up by a tangle of mountains into many small\r\ndistricts. Hence it was easier for the Italians, than for the Greeks, to\r\nestablish one large and united state. In the second place, Italy, which\r\nhas few good harbors but possesses fine mountain pastures and rich lowland\r\nplains, was better adapted to cattle raising and agriculture than was\r\nGreece. The Italian peoples, in consequence, instead of putting to sea,\r\nremained a conservative, home-staying folk, who were slow to adopt the\r\ncustoms of other nations. Finally, the location of Italy, with its best\r\nharbors and most numerous islands on the western coast, brought that\r\ncountry into closer touch with Gaul, Spain, and northwestern Africa than\r\nwith Greece and the Orient. Italy fronted the barbarous West.\r\n\r\n\r\n48. THE PEOPLES OF ITALY\r\n\r\nNEIGHBORS OF THE ROMANS\r\n\r\nLong before the Romans built their city by the Tiber every part of Italy\r\nhad become the home of wandering peoples, attracted by the mild climate\r\nand rich soil of this favored land. Two of these peoples were neighbors of\r\nthe Romans--Etruscans on the north and Greeks on the south.\r\n\r\nTHE ETRUSCANS\r\n\r\nThe ancestors of the historic Etruscans were probably Aegean sea-rovers\r\nwho settled in the Italian peninsula before the beginning of the eighth\r\ncentury B.C. The immigrants mingled with the natives and by conquest and\r\ncolonization founded a strong power in the country to which they gave\r\ntheir name--Etruria. At one time the Etruscans appear to have ruled over\r\nCampania and also in the Po Valley as far as the Alps. Their colonies\r\noccupied the shores of Sardinia and Corsica. Their fleets swept the\r\nTyrrhenian Sea. The Etruscans for several centuries were the leading\r\nnation in Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GRAECO-ETRUSCAN CHARIOT (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New\r\nYork)\r\n\r\nThe chariot was discovered in 1903 A.D. in an Etruscan cemetery near Rome.\r\nIt dates from perhaps 600 B.C. Almost every part of the vehicle is covered\r\nwith thin plates of bronze, elaborately decorated. The wheels are only two\r\nfeet in diameter. Since the chariot is too small and delicate for use in\r\nwarfare, we may believe it to have been intended for ceremonial purposes\r\nonly.]\r\n\r\nETRUSCAN CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nThese Etruscans, like the Hittites of Asia Minor, [3] are a mysterious\r\nrace. No one as yet has been able to read their language, which is quite\r\nunlike any Indo-European tongue. The words, however, are written in an\r\nalphabet borrowed from Greek settlers in Italy. Many other civilizing arts\r\nbesides the alphabet came to the Etruscans from abroad. Babylonia gave to\r\nthem the principle of the round arch and the practice of divination. [4]\r\nEtruscan graves contain Egyptian seals adorned with hieroglyphics and\r\nbeautiful vases bearing designs from Greek mythology. The Etruscans were\r\nskillful workers in iron, bronze, and gold. They built their cities with\r\nmassive walls, arched gates, paved streets, and underground drains. In the\r\ncourse of time a great part of this Etruscan civilization was absorbed in\r\nthat of Rome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ETRUSCAN ARCH\r\nThe Italian city of Volterra still preserves in the Porta dell' Arco an\r\ninteresting relic of Etruscan times. The archway, one of the original\r\ngates of the ancient town, is about twenty feet in height and twelve feet\r\nin width. On the keystone and imposts are three curious heads, probably\r\nrepresenting the guardian deities of the place.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARACTERS OF THE ETRUSCAN ALPHABET\r\nAbout eight thousand Etruscan inscriptions are known, almost all being\r\nshort epitaphs on gravestones. In 1892 A.D. an Etruscan manuscript which\r\nhad been used to pack an Egyptian mummy, was published, but the language\r\ncould not be deciphered.]\r\n\r\nTHE GREEKS\r\n\r\nAs teachers of the Romans the Etruscans were followed by the Greeks. About\r\nthe middle of the eighth century B.C. Hellenic colonies began to occupy\r\nthe coasts of Sicily and southern Italy. The earliest Greek settlement was\r\nCumae, near the bay of Naples. [5] It was a city as old as Rome itself,\r\nand a center from which Greek culture, including the Greek alphabet,\r\nspread to Latium. A glance at the map [6] shows that the chief Greek\r\nColonies were all on or near the Sea, from Campania to the gulf of\r\nTarentum. North of the \"heel\" of Italy extends an almost harborless coast,\r\nwhere nothing tempted the Greeks to settle. North of Campania, again, they\r\nfound the good harbors already occupied by the Etruscans. The Greeks, in\r\nconsequence, were never able to make Italy a completely Hellenic land.\r\nRoom was left for the native Italian peoples, under the leadership of\r\nRome, to build up their own power in the peninsula.\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN HIGHLANDERS\r\n\r\nThe Italians were an Indo-European people who spoke a language closely\r\nrelated, on the one side, to Greek and, on the other side, to the Celtic\r\ntongues of western Europe. They entered Italy through the Alpine passes,\r\nlong before the dawn of history, and gradually pushed southward until they\r\noccupied the interior of the peninsula. At the beginning of historic times\r\nthey had separated into two main branches. The eastern and central parts\r\nof Italy formed the home of the highlanders, grouped in various tribes.\r\nAmong them were the Umbrians in the northeast, the Sabines in the upper\r\nvalley of the Tiber, and the Samnites in the south. Still other Italian\r\npeoples occupied the peninsula as far as Magna Graecia.\r\n\r\nTHE LATINS\r\n\r\nThe western Italians were known as Latins. They dwelt in Latium, the \"flat\r\nland\" extending south of the Tiber between the Apennines and the\r\nTyrrhenian Sea. Residence in the lowlands, where they bordered on the\r\nEtruscans, helped to make the Latins a civilized people. Their village\r\ncommunities grew into larger settlements, until the whole of Latium became\r\nfilled with a number of independent city-states. The ties of kinship and\r\nthe necessity of defense against Etruscan and Sabine foes bound them\r\ntogether. At a very early period they had united in the Latin League,\r\nunder the headship of Alba Longa. Another city in this league was Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n49. THE ROMANS\r\n\r\nFOUNDING OF ROME\r\n\r\nRome sprang from a settlement of Latin shepherds, farmers, and traders on\r\nthe Palatine Mount. [7] This was the central eminence in a group of low\r\nhills south of the Tiber, about fifteen miles by water from the river's\r\nmouth. Opposite the Palatine community there arose on the Quirinal Hill\r\nanother settlement, which seems to have been an outpost of the Sabines.\r\nAfter much hard fighting the rival hill towns united on equal terms into\r\none state. The low marshy land between the Palatine and Quirinal became\r\nthe Forum, or common market place, and the steep rock, known as the\r\nCapitoline, formed the common citadel. [8]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, VICINITY OF ROME.]\r\n\r\nUNION OF THE SEVEN HILLS\r\n\r\nThe union of the Palatine and Quirinal settlements greatly increased the\r\narea and population of the Roman city. In course of time settlements were\r\nmade on the neighboring hills and these, too, cast in their lot with Rome.\r\nThen a fortification, the so-called \"Wall of Servius,\" was built to bring\r\nthem all within the boundaries of the enlarged community. Rome came into\r\nexistence as the City of the Seven Hills.\r\n\r\nMYTHS OF EARLY ROME\r\n\r\nLong after the foundation of Rome, when that city had grown rich and\r\npowerful, her poets and historians delighted to relate the many myths\r\nwhich clustered about the earlier stages of her career. According to these\r\nmyths Rome began as a colony of Alba Longa, the capital of Latium. The\r\nfounder of this city was Ascanius, son of the Trojan prince Aeneas, who\r\nhad escaped from Troy on its capture by the Greeks and after long\r\nwanderings had reached the coast of Italy. Many generations afterwards,\r\nwhen Numitor sat on the throne of Alba Longa, his younger brother,\r\nAmulius, plotted against him and drove him into exile. He had Numitor's\r\nson put to death, and forced the daughter, Rhea Silvia, to take the vows\r\nof a Vestal Virgin. [9]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EARLY ROMAN COIN\r\nShows the twins, Romulus and Remus as infants suckled by a wolf.]\r\n\r\nROMULUS AND REMUS\r\n\r\nBut Rhea Silvia, beloved by Mars, the god of war, gave birth to twin boys\r\nof more than human size and beauty. The wicked Amulius ordered the\r\nchildren to be set adrift in a basket on the Tiber. Heaven, however,\r\nguarded these offspring of a god; the river cast them ashore near Mount\r\nPalatine, and a she-wolf came and nursed them. There they were discovered\r\nby a shepherd, who reared them in his own household. When the twins,\r\nRomulus and Remus, reached manhood, they killed Amulius and restored their\r\ngrandfather to his kingdom. With other young men from Alba Longa, they\r\nthen set forth to build a new city on the Palatine, where they had been\r\nrescued. As they scanned the sky to learn the will of the gods, six\r\nvultures, birds of Jupiter, appeared to Remus; but twelve were seen by\r\nRomulus. So Romulus marked out the boundary of the city on the Palatine,\r\nand Remus, who in derision leaped over the half-finished wall, he slew in\r\nanger. Romulus thus became the sole founder of Rome and its first king.\r\n\r\nSUCCESSORS OF ROMULUS\r\n\r\nRomulus was followed by a Sabine, Numa Pompilius, who taught the Romans\r\nthe arts of peace and the worship of the gods. Another king destroyed Alba\r\nLonga and brought the inhabitants to Rome. The last of Rome's seven kings\r\nwas an Etruscan named Tarquin the Proud. His tyranny finally provoked an\r\nuprising, and Rome became a republic.\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE MYTHS\r\n\r\nThese famous tales have become a part of the world's literature and still\r\npossess value to the student. They show us what the Romans themselves\r\nbelieved about the foundation and early fortunes of their city. Sometimes\r\nthey refer to what seem to be facts, such as the first settlement on the\r\nPalatine, the union with the Sabines on the Quirinal, the conquest of Alba\r\nLonga, and Etruscan rule at Rome. The myths also contain so many\r\nreferences to customs and beliefs that they are a great help in\r\nunderstanding the social life and religion of the early Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\n50. EARLY ROMAN SOCIETY\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANS AN AGRICULTURAL PEOPLE\r\n\r\nAgriculture was the chief occupation of the Roman people. \"When our\r\nforefathers,\" said an ancient writer, \"would praise a worthy man, they\r\npraised him as a good farmer and a good landlord; and they believed that\r\nan praise could go no further.\" [10] Roman farmers raised large crops of\r\ngrain--the staple product of ancient Italy. Cattle-breeding, also, must\r\nhave been an important pursuit, since in early times prices were estimated\r\nin oxen and sheep. [11]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ROMAN FARMER'S CALENDAR\r\nA marble cube, two feet high, of about 31-29 B.C.\r\n  The month of May,\r\n  XXXI days,\r\n  The nones fall on the 7th day.\r\n  The day has 19-1/2 hours.\r\n  The night has 9-1/2 hours\r\n  The sun is in the sign of Taurus\r\n  The month is under the protection of Apollo.\r\n  The corn is weeded\r\n  The sheep are shorn\r\n  The wool is washed\r\n  Young steers are put under the yoke.\r\n  The vetch of the meadows is cut.\r\n  The lustration of the crops is made.\r\n  Sacrifices to Mercury and Flora.]\r\n\r\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nIn such a community of peasants no great inequalities of wealth existed.\r\nFew citizens were very rich; few were very poor. The members of each\r\nhousehold made their own clothing from flax or wool, and fashioned out of\r\nwood and clay what utensils were needed for their simple life. For a long\r\ntime the Romans had no coined money whatever. When copper came into use as\r\ncurrency, it passed from hand to hand in shapeless lumps that required\r\nfrequent weighing. It was not until the fourth century that a regular\r\ncoinage began. [12] This use of copper as money indicates that gold and\r\nsilver were rare among the Romans, and luxury almost unknown.\r\n\r\nMORAL CHARACTER OF THE EARLY ROMANS\r\n\r\nHard-working, god-fearing peasants are likely to lead clean and sober\r\nlives. This was certainly true of the early Romans. They were a manly\r\nbreed, abstemious in food and drink, iron-willed, vigorous, and strong.\r\nDeep down in the Roman's heart was the proud conviction that Rome should\r\nrule over all her neighbors. For this he freely shed his blood; for this\r\nhe bore hardship, however severe, without complaint. Before everything\r\nelse, he was a dutiful citizen and a true patriot. Such were the sturdy\r\nmen who on their farms in Latium formed the backbone of the Roman state.\r\nTheir character has set its mark on history for all time.\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN FAMILY\r\n\r\nThe family formed the unit of Roman society. Its most marked feature was\r\nthe unlimited authority of the father. In his house he reigned an absolute\r\nking. His wife had no legal rights: he could sell her into slavery or\r\ndivorce her at will. Nevertheless, no ancient people honored women more\r\nhighly than the Romans. A Roman wife was the mistress of the home, as her\r\nhusband was its master. Though her education was not carried far, we often\r\nfind the Roman matron taking a lively interest in affairs of state, and\r\naiding her husband both in politics and business. It was the women, as\r\nwell as the men, who helped to make Rome great among the nations. Over his\r\nunmarried daughters and his sons, the Roman father ruled as supreme as\r\nover his wife. He brought up his children to be sober, silent, modest in\r\ntheir bearing, and, above all, obedient. Their misdeeds he might punish\r\nwith penalties as severe as banishment, slavery, or death. As head of the\r\nfamily he could claim all their earnings; everything they had was his. The\r\nfather's great authority ceased only with his death. Then his sons, in\r\nturn, became lords over their families.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CINERARY URNS IN TERRA COTTA (Vatican Museum, Rome)\r\nThese receptacles for the ashes of the dead were found in an old cemetery\r\nat Alba Longa They show two forms of the primitive Roman hut.]\r\n\r\n\r\n51. ROMAN RELIGION\r\n\r\nWORSHIP OF ANCESTORS\r\n\r\nThe Romans, like the ancient Greeks and the modern Chinese, paid special\r\nveneration to the souls of the dead. These were known by the flattering\r\nname of _manes_, the \"pure\" or \"good ones.\" The Romans always regarded the\r\n_manes_ as members of the household to which they had belonged on earth.\r\nThe living and the dead were thus bound together by the closest ties. The\r\nidea of the family triumphed even over the grave.\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSEHOLD DEITIES\r\n\r\nThe ancient Roman house had only one large room, the _atrium_, where all\r\nmembers of the family lived together. It was entered by a single door,\r\nwhich was sacred to the god Janus. On the hearth, opposite the doorway,\r\nthe housewife prepared the meals. The fire that ever blazed upon it gave\r\nwarmth and nourishment to the inmates. Here dwelt Vesta, the spirit of the\r\nkindling flame. The cupboard where the food was kept came under the charge\r\nof the Penates, who blessed the family store. The house as a whole had its\r\nprotecting spirits, called Lares.\r\n\r\nWORSHIP OF THE HOUSEHOLD DEITIES\r\n\r\nThe daily worship of these deities took place at the family meal. The\r\ntable would be placed at the side of the hearth, and when the father and\r\nhis family sat down to it, a little food would be thrown into the flames\r\nand a portion of wine poured out, as an offering to the gods. The images\r\nof the Lares and Penates would also be fetched from the shrine and placed\r\non the table in token of their presence at the meal. This religion of the\r\nfamily lasted with little change throughout the entire period of Roman\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VESTAL VIRGIN\r\nPortrait from a statue discovered in the ruins of the temple of Vesta in\r\nthe Roman Forum.]\r\n\r\nJANUS AND VESTA\r\n\r\nThe early Roman state was only an enlarged family, and hence the religion\r\nof the state was modeled after that of the family. Some of the divinities,\r\nsuch as Janus and Vesta, were taken over with little change from the\r\ndomestic worship. The entrance to the Forum formed a shrine of Janus, [13]\r\nwhich Numa himself was said to have built. The door, or gateway, stood\r\nopen in time of war, but shut when Rome was at peace. At the south end of\r\nthe Forum stood the round temple of Vesta, containing the sacred hearth of\r\nthe city. Here Vesta was served by six virgins of free birth, whose duty\r\nit was to keep the fire always blazing on the altar. If by accident the\r\nfire went out, it must be relighted from a \"pure flame,\" either by\r\nstriking a spark with flint or by rubbing together two dry sticks. Such\r\nmethods of kindling fire were those familiar to the prehistoric Romans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUOVETAURILIA (Louvre, Paris)\r\nThe relief pictures an ancient Italian sacrifice of a bull, a ram and a\r\nboar offered to Mars to secure purification from sin.

Another attendant carries a ewer with the libation. In the rear\r\nis the sacrificer with his ax.]\r\n\r\nJUPITER AND MARS\r\n\r\nThe Romans worshiped various gods connected with their lives as shepherds,\r\nfarmers, and warriors. The chief divinity was Jupiter, who ruled the\r\nheavens and sent rain and sunshine to nourish the crops. The war god Mars\r\nreflected the military character of the Romans. His sacred animal was the\r\nfierce, cruel wolf, his symbols were spears and shields; his altar was the\r\nCampus Martius (Field of Mars) outside the city walls, where the army\r\nassembled in battle array. March, the first month of the old Roman year,\r\nwas named in his honor. Some other gods were borrowed from the Greeks,\r\ntogether with many of the beautiful Greek myths.\r\n\r\nDIVINATION\r\n\r\nThe Romans took many precautions, before beginning any enterprise, to find\r\nout what was the will of the gods and how their favor might first be\r\ngained. They did not have oracles, but they paid much attention to omens\r\nof all sorts. A sudden flash of lightning, an eclipse of the sun, a\r\nblazing comet, or an earthquake shock was an omen which awakened\r\nsuperstitious fear. It indicated the disapproval of the gods. From the\r\nEtruscans the Romans learned to divine the future by examining the\r\nentrails of animal victims. They also borrowed from their northern\r\nneighbors the practice of looking for signs in the number, flight, and\r\naction of birds. To consult such signs was called \"taking the auspices.\"\r\n[14]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ETRUSCAN AUGUR\r\nWall painting from a tomb at Tarquinii in Etruria.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COOP WITH SACRED CHICKENS\r\nThe relief represents the chickens in the act of feeding. The most\r\nfavorable omen was secured when the fowls greedily picked up more of the\r\ncorn than they could swallow at one time. Their refusal to eat at all was\r\nan omen of disaster.]\r\n\r\nPRIESTHOODS\r\n\r\nRoman priests, who conducted the state religion, did not form a separate\r\nclass, as in some Oriental countries. They were chosen, like other\r\nmagistrates, from the general body of citizens. A board, or \"college,\" of\r\nsix priests had charge of the public auspices. Another board, that of the\r\npontiffs, regulated the calendar, kept the public annals, and regulated\r\nweights and measures. They were experts in all matters of religious\r\nceremonial and hence were very important officials. [15]\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF THE STATE RELIGION\r\n\r\nThis old Roman faith was something very different from what we understand\r\nby religion. It had little direct influence on morality. It did not\r\npromise rewards or threaten punishments in a future world. Roman religion\r\nbusied itself with the everyday life of man. Just as the household was\r\nbound together by the tie of common worship, so all the citizens were\r\nunited in a common reverence for the deities which guarded the state. The\r\nreligion of Rome made and held together a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n52. THE ROMAN CITY-STATE\r\n\r\nEARLY ROMAN GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nWe find in early Rome, as in Homeric Greece, [16] a city-state with its\r\nking, council, and assembly. The king was the father of his people, having\r\nover them the same absolute authority that the house-father held within\r\nthe family. The king was assisted by a council of elders, or Senate (Latin\r\n_senes_, \"old men\"). Its members were chosen by the king and held office\r\nfor life. The most influential heads of families belonged to the Senate.\r\nThe common people at first took little part in the government, for it was\r\nonly on rare occasions that the king summoned them to deliberate with him\r\nin an assembly.\r\n\r\nTHE REPUBLICAN CONSULS\r\n\r\nToward the close of the sixth century, as we have already learned, [17]\r\nthe ancient monarchy disappeared from Rome. In place of the lifelong king\r\ntwo magistrates, named consuls, were elected every year. Each consul had\r\nto share his honor and authority with a colleague who enjoyed the same\r\npower as himself. Unless both agreed, there could be no action. Like the\r\nSpartan kings, [18] the consuls served as checks, the one on the other.\r\nNeither could safely use his position to aim at unlawful rule.\r\n\r\nTHE DICTATOR\r\n\r\nThis divided power of the consuls might work very well in times of peace.\r\nDuring dangerous wars or insurrections it was likely to prove disastrous.\r\nA remedy was found in the temporary revival of the old kingship under a\r\nnew name. When occasion required, one of the consuls, on the advice of the\r\nSenate, appointed a dictator. The consuls then gave up their authority and\r\nthe people put their property and lives entirely at the dictator's\r\ndisposal. During his term of office, which could not exceed six months,\r\nthe state was under martial law. Throughout Roman history there were many\r\noccasions when a dictatorship was created to meet a sudden emergency.\r\n\r\nPATRICIANS AND PLEBEIANS\r\n\r\nThe Roman state, during the regal age, seems to have been divided between\r\nan aristocracy and a commons. The nobles were called patricians, [19] and\r\nthe common people were known as plebeians. [20] The patricians occupied a\r\nprivileged position, since they alone sat in the Senate and served as\r\npriests, judges, and magistrates. In fact, they controlled society, and\r\nthe common people found themselves excluded from much of the religious,\r\nlegal, and political life of the Roman city. Under these circumstances it\r\nwas natural for the plebeians to agitate against the patrician monopoly of\r\ngovernment. The struggle between the two orders of society lasted about\r\ntwo centuries.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBUNES\r\n\r\nA few years after the establishment of the republic the plebeians\r\ncompelled the patricians to allow them to have officers of their own,\r\ncalled tribunes, as a means of protection. There were ten tribunes,\r\nelected annually by the plebeians. Any tribune could veto, that is,\r\nforbid, the act of a magistrate which seemed to bear harshly on a citizen.\r\nTo make sure that a tribune's orders would be respected, his person was\r\nmade sacred and a solemn curse was pronounced upon the man who injured him\r\nor interrupted him in the performance of his duties. The tribune's\r\nauthority, however, extended only within the city and a mile beyond its\r\nwalls. He was quite powerless against the consul in the field.\r\n\r\nTHE TWELVE TABLES, 449 B.C.\r\n\r\nWe next find the plebeians struggling for equality before the law. Just as\r\nin ancient Athens, [21] the early Roman laws had never been written down\r\nor published. About half a century after the plebeians had obtained the\r\ntribunes, they forced the patricians to give them written laws. A board of\r\nten men, known as decemvirs, was appointed to frame a legal code, binding\r\nequally on both patricians and plebeians. The story goes that this\r\ncommission studied the legislation of the Greek states of southern Italy,\r\nand even went to Athens to examine some of Solon's laws which were still\r\nin force. The laws framed by the decemvirs were engraved on twelve bronze\r\ntablets and set up in the Forum. A few sentences from this famous code\r\nhave come down to us in rude, unpolished Latin. They mark the beginning of\r\nwhat was to be Rome's greatest gift to civilization--her legal system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURULE CHAIR AND FASCES\r\nA consul sat on the curule chair. The _fasces_ (axes in a bundle of rods)\r\nsymbolized his power to flog and behead offenders.]\r\n\r\nFINAL TRIUMPH OF THE PLEBEIANS\r\n\r\nThe hardest task of the plebeians was to secure the right of holding the\r\ngreat offices of state. Eventually, however, they gained entrance to\r\nSenate and became eligible to the consulship and other magistracies and to\r\nthe priesthoods. By the middle of the third century the plebeians and\r\npatricians, equal before the law and with equal privileges, formed one\r\ncompact body of citizens in the Roman state.\r\n\r\nROME AS A REPUBLIC\r\n\r\nThe Roman state called itself a republic--_respublica_--\"a thing of the\r\npeople.\" Roman citizens made the laws and elected public officers. Though\r\nthe people in their gatherings had now become supreme, their power was\r\nreally much limited by the fact that very little discussion of a proposed\r\nmeasure was allowed. This formed a striking contrast to the vigorous\r\ndebating which went on in the Athenian Assembly. [22] Roman citizens could\r\nnot frame, criticize, or amend public measures; they could only vote \"yes\"\r\nor \"no\" to proposals made to them by a magistrate.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATES\r\n\r\nRome had many magistrates. Besides the two consuls and an occasional\r\ndictator there were the ten tribunes, the praetors, who served as judges,\r\nand the quaestors, or keepers of the treasury. The two censors were also\r\nvery important officers. It was their business to make an enumeration or\r\ncensus of the citizens and to assess property for taxation. The censors\r\nalmost always were reverend seniors who had held the consulship and\r\nenjoyed a reputation for justice and wisdom. Their office grew steadily in\r\nimportance, especially after the censors began to exercise an oversight of\r\nthe private life of the Romans. They could expel a senator from his seat\r\nfor immorality and could deprive any citizen of his vote. The word\r\n\"censorious,\" meaning faultfinding, is derived from the name of these\r\nancient officials.\r\n\r\nMEMBERSHIP OF THE SENATE\r\n\r\nThe authority of the magistrates was much limited by the Senate. This body\r\ncontained about three hundred members, who held their seats generally for\r\nlife. When vacancies occurred, they were filled, as a rule, by those who\r\nhad previously held one or more of the higher magistracies. There sat in\r\nthe Senate every man who, as statesman, general, or diplomatist, had\r\nserved his country well.\r\n\r\nPOWERS EXERCISED BY THE SENATE\r\n\r\nThe Senate furnished an admirable school for debate. Any senator could\r\nspeak as long and as often as he chose. The opportunities for discussion\r\nwere numerous, for all weighty matters came before this august assemblage.\r\nIt managed finances and public works. It looked after the state religion.\r\nIt declared and conducted war, received ambassadors from foreign\r\ncountries, made alliances, and administered conquered territories. The\r\nSenate formed the real governing body of the republic.\r\n\r\n\"AN ASSEMBLY OF KINGS\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate proved not unworthy of its high position. For two centuries,\r\nwhile Rome was winning dominion over Italy and the Mediterranean, that\r\nbody held the wisest and noblest Romans of the time. To these men office\r\nmeant a public trust--an opportunity to serve their country with\r\ndistinction and honor. The Senate, in its best days, was a splendid\r\nexample of the foresight, energy, and wisdom of republican Rome. An\r\nadmiring foreigner called it \"an assembly of kings.\" [23]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SCENE IN SICILY\r\nTaormina, on the Sicilian coast, thirty one miles southwest of Messina.\r\nThe ruins are those of a theater, founded by the Greeks, but much altered\r\nin Roman times.

EXPANSION OF ROME OVER ITALY, 509(?)-264 B.C.\r\n\r\nROME SUPREME IN LATIUM, 338 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe first centuries of the republic were filled with constant warfare. The\r\nRomans needed all their skill, bravery, and patriotism to keep back the\r\nEtruscans on the north, and the wild tribes of the Apennines. About 390\r\nB.C. the state was brought near to destruction by an invasion of the\r\nGauls. [24] These barbarians, whose huge bulk and enormous weapons struck\r\nterror to the hearts of their adversaries, poured through the Alpine\r\npasses and ravaged far and wide. At the river Allia, only a few miles from\r\nRome, they annihilated a Roman army and then captured and burned the city\r\nitself. But the Gallic tide receded as swiftly as it had come, and Rome\r\nrose from her ashes mightier than ever. Half a century after the Gallic\r\ninvasion she was able to subdue her former allies, the Latins, and to\r\ndestroy their league. The Latin War, as it is called, ended in 338 B.C.,\r\nthe year of the fateful battle of Chaeronea in Greece. [25] By this time\r\nRome ruled in Latium and southern Etruria and had begun to extend her sway\r\nover Campania. There remained only one Italian people to contest with her\r\nthe supremacy of the peninsula--the Samnites.\r\n\r\nROME SUPREME IN CENTRAL ITLAY, 290 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe Samnites were the most vigorous and warlike race of central Italy.\r\nWhile the Romans were winning their way in Latium, the Samnites were also\r\nentering on a career of conquest. They coveted the fertile Campanian plain\r\nwith its luxurious cities, Cumae and Neapolis, which the Greeks had\r\nfounded. The Romans had also fixed their eyes on the same region, and so a\r\ncontest between the two peoples became inevitable. In numbers, courage,\r\nand military skill Romans and Samnites were well matched. Nearly half a\r\ncentury of hard fighting was required before Rome gained the upper hand.\r\nThe close of the Samnite wars found Rome supreme in central Italy. Her\r\nauthority was now recognized from the upper Apennines to the foot of the\r\npeninsula.\r\n\r\nROME SUPREME IN SOUTHERN ITALY, 264 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe wealthy cities of southern Italy offered a tempting prize to Roman\r\ngreed. Before long many of them received Roman garrisons and accepted the\r\nrule of the great Latin republic. Tarentum, [26] however, the most\r\nimportant of the Greek colonies, held jealously to her independence.\r\nUnable single-handed to face the Romans, Tarentum turned to Greece for\r\naid. She called on Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, the finest soldier of his age.\r\nPyrrhus led twenty-five thousand mercenary soldiers into Italy, an army\r\nalmost as large as Alexander's. The Romans could not break the bristling\r\nranks of the Greek phalanx, and they shrank back in terror before the huge\r\nwar elephants which Pyrrhus had brought with him. The invader won the\r\nfirst battle, but lost many of his best troops. He then offered peace on\r\ncondition that the Romans should give up their possessions in southern\r\nItaly. The Senate returned the proud reply that Rome would not treat with\r\nthe enemy while he stood on Italian soil. A second battle was so bitterly\r\ncontested that Pyrrhus declared, \"Another such victory, and I am lost.\"\r\n[27] Weary of the struggle, Pyrrhus now crossed over to Sicily to aid his\r\ncountrymen against the Carthaginians. The rapid progress of the Roman arms\r\ncalled him back, only to meet a severe defeat. Pyrrhus then withdrew in\r\ndisgust to Greece; Tarentum fell; and Rome established her rule over\r\nsouthern Italy.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL SITUATION IN 264 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe triumph over Pyrrhus and the conquest of Magna Graecia mark a decisive\r\nmoment in the history of Rome. Had Pyrrhus won Italy, as well as Asia and\r\nEgypt, might have become a Greek land, ruled by Hellenistic kings. Now it\r\nwas clear that Rome, having met the invader so bravely, was to remain\r\nsupreme in the Italian peninsula. She was the undisputed mistress of Italy\r\nfrom the strait of Messina northward to the Arnus and the Rubicon.\r\nEtruscans, Latins, Samnites, and Greeks acknowledged her sway. The central\r\ncity of the peninsula had become the center of a united Italy. [28]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, THE EXPANSION of ROMAN DOMINIONS in ITALY, 500-264\r\nB.C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n54. ITALY UNDER ROMAN RULE\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN CITIZENS\r\n\r\nItaly did not form a single state under Roman rule. About one-third of\r\nItaly composed the strictly Roman territory occupied by Roman citizens.\r\nSince ancient Rome knew nothing of the great principle of representative\r\ngovernment, [29] it was necessary that citizens who wished to vote or to\r\nstand for office should visit in person the capital city. Few men, of\r\ncourse, would journey many miles to Rome in order to exercise their\r\npolitical rights. The elections, moreover, were not all held on one day,\r\nas with us, but consuls, praetors, and other magistrates were chosen on\r\ndifferent days, while meetings of the assemblies might be held at any time\r\nof the year. A country peasant who really tried to fulfill his duties as a\r\ncitizen would have had little time for anything else. In practice,\r\ntherefore, the city populace at Rome had the controlling voice in ordinary\r\nlegislation. The Romans were never able to remedy this grave defect in\r\ntheir political system. We shall see later what evils government without\r\nrepresentation brought in its train.\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIANS\r\n\r\nOver against this body of Roman citizens were the Italian peoples. Rome\r\nwas not yet ready to grant them citizenship, but she did not treat them as\r\ncomplete subjects. The Italians were called the \"allies and friends\" of\r\nthe Roman people. They lost the right of declaring war on one another, of\r\nmaking treaties, and of coining money. Rome otherwise allowed them to\r\ngovern themselves, never calling on them for tribute and only requiring\r\nthat they should furnish soldiers for the Roman army in time of war. These\r\nallies occupied a large part of the Italian peninsula.\r\n\r\nTHE LATIN COLONIES\r\n\r\nThe Romans very early began to establish what were called Latin colonies\r\n[30] in various parts of Italy. The colonists were usually veteran\r\nsoldiers or poor plebeians colonies who wanted farms of their own. When\r\nthe list of colonists was made up, they all marched forth in military\r\narray to lake possession of their new homes and build their city. The\r\nLatin colonies were really offshoots of Rome and hence were always\r\nfaithful to her interests. Scattered everywhere in Italy they formed so\r\nmany permanent camps or garrisons to keep the conquered peoples in\r\nsubjection. At the same time they helped mightily in spreading the Latin\r\nlanguage, law, and civilization throughout the peninsula.\r\n\r\nROMAN ROADS\r\n\r\nAll the colonies were united with one another and with Rome by an\r\nextensive system of roads. The first great road, called the Appian Way,\r\nwas made during the period of the Samnite wars. It united the city of Rome\r\nwith Capua and secured the hold of Rome on Campania. The Appian Way was\r\nafterwards carried across the Apennines to Brundisium on the Adriatic,\r\nwhence travelers embarked for the coast of Greece. Other trunk lines were\r\nsoon built in Italy, and from them a network of smaller highways was\r\nextended to every part of the peninsula.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, COLONIES AND MILITARY ROADS IN ITALY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE APPIAN WAY\r\nA view in the neighborhood of Rome. The ancient construction of the road\r\nand its massive paving blocks of lava have been laid bare by modern\r\nexcavations. The width of the roadway proper was only fifteen feet. The\r\narches, seen in the background, belong to the aqueduct built by the\r\nemperor Claudius in 52 A.D.]\r\n\r\nUSES OF ROMAN ROADS\r\n\r\nRoman roads had a military origin. Like the old Persian roads [31] they\r\nwere intended to facilitate the rapid dispatch of troops, supplies, and\r\nofficial messages into every corner of Italy. Hence the roads ran, as much\r\nas possible, in straight lines and on easy grades. Nothing was allowed to\r\nobstruct their course. Engineers cut through or tunneled the hills,\r\nbridged rivers and gorges, and spanned low, swampy lands with viaducts of\r\nstone. So carefully were these roads constructed that some stretches of\r\nthem are still in good condition. These magnificent highways were free to\r\nthe public. They naturally became avenues of trade and travel and so\r\nserved to bring the Italian peoples into close touch with Rome.\r\n\r\nROMANIZATION OF ITALY\r\n\r\nRome thus began in Italy that wonderful process of Romanization which she\r\nwas to extend later to Spain, Gaul, and Britain. She began to make, the\r\nItalian peoples like herself in blood, speech, customs, and manners. More\r\nand more the Italians, under Rome's leadership, came to look upon\r\nthemselves as one people--the people who wore the gown, or _toga_, as\r\ncontrasted with the barbarous and trousers-wearing Gauls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ROMAN LEGIONARY\r\nFrom a monument of the imperial age. The soldier wears a metal helmet, a\r\nleather doublet with shoulder-pieces, a metal-plated belt, and a sword\r\nhanging from a strap thrown over the left shoulder. His left hand holds a\r\nlarge shield, his right, a heavy javelin.]\r\n\r\n\r\n55. THE ROMAN ARMY\r\n\r\nTHE LEGION\r\n\r\nWhile the Romans were conquering Italy, they were making many improvements\r\nin their army. All citizens between the ages of seventeen and forty-six\r\nwere liable to active service. These men were mainly landowners--hardy,\r\nintelligent peasants--who knew how to fight and how to obey orders. An\r\narmy in the field consisted of one or more legions. A legion included\r\nabout three thousand heavy-armed footmen, twelve hundred light infantry,\r\nand three hundred horsemen. After the conquest of Italy the states allied\r\nwith Rome had to furnish soldiers, chiefly archers and cavalry. These\r\nauxiliaries, as they were called, were at least as numerous as\r\nlegionaries. The Romans, in carrying on war, employed not only their\r\ncitizens but also their subjects.\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF FIGHTING\r\n\r\nThe legion offered a sharp contrast to the unwieldy phalanx. [32] Roman\r\nsoldiers usually fought in an open order, with the heavy-armed infantry\r\narranged in three lines: first, the younger men; next, the more\r\nexperienced warriors; and lastly the veterans. A battle began with\r\nskirmishing by the light troops, which moved to the front and discharged\r\ntheir darts to harass the enemy. The companies of the first line next\r\nflung their javelins at a distance of from ten to twenty paces and then,\r\nwielding their terrible short swords, came at once to close quarters with\r\nthe foe. It was like a volley of musketry followed by a fierce bayonet\r\ncharge. If the attack proved unsuccessful, the wearied soldiers withdrew\r\nto the rear through the gaps in the line behind. The second line now\r\nmarched forward to the attack; if it was repulsed, there was still the\r\nthird line of steady veterans for the last and decisive blow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ROMAN STANDARD BEARER (Bonn Museum)\r\nFrom a gravestone of the first century A.D. The standard consists of a\r\nspear crowned with a wreath, below which is a crossbar bearing pendant\r\nacorns Then follow, in order, a metal disk, Jupiter's eagle standing on a\r\nthunderbolt, a crescent moon, an amulet, and a large tassel.]\r\n\r\nFORTIFIED CAMPS\r\n\r\nA very remarkable part of the Roman military system consisted in the use\r\nof fortified camps. Every time the army halted, if only for a single\r\nnight, the legionaries intrenched themselves within a square inclosure. It\r\nwas protected by a ditch, an earthen mound, and a palisade of stakes. This\r\ncamp formed a little city with its streets, its four gates, a forum, and\r\nthe headquarters of the general. Behind the walls of such a fortress an\r\narmy was always at liberty to accept or decline a battle. As a proverb\r\nsaid, the Romans often conquered by \"sitting still.\"\r\n\r\nDISCIPLINE: REWARDS AND HONORS\r\n\r\nRoman soldiers lived under the strictest discipline. To their general they\r\nowed absolute, unquestioning obedience. He could condemn them to death\r\nwithout trial. The sentinel who slept on his watch, the legionary who\r\ndisobeyed an order or threw away his arms on the field of battle, might be\r\nscourged with rods and then beheaded. The men were encouraged to deeds of\r\nvalor by various marks of distinction, which the general presented to them\r\nin the presence of the entire army. The highest reward was the civic crown\r\nof oak leaves, granted to one who had saved the life of a fellow-soldier\r\non the battle field.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIUMPH\r\n\r\nThe state sometimes bestowed on a victorious general the honor of a\r\ntriumph. This was a grand parade and procession in the city of Rome. First\r\ncame the magistrates and senators, wagons laden with booty, and captives\r\nin chains. Then followed the conqueror himself, clad in a gorgeous robe\r\nand riding in a four-horse chariot. Behind him marched the soldiers, who\r\nsang a triumphal hymn. The long procession passed through the streets to\r\nthe Forum and mounted the Capitoline Hill. There the general laid his\r\nlaurel crown upon the knees of the statue of Jupiter, as a thank offering\r\nfor victory. Meanwhile, the captives who had just appeared in the\r\nprocession were strangled in the underground prison of the Capitol. It was\r\na day of mingled joy and tragedy.\r\n\r\nMILITARY GENIUS OF THE ROMANS\r\n\r\nThe Romans, it has been said, were sometimes vanquished in battle, but\r\nthey were always victorious in war. With the short swords of her\r\ndisciplined soldiers, her flexible legion, and her fortified camps, Rome\r\nwon dominion in Italy and began the conquest of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

THE RIVALS: ROME AND CARTHAGE, 264-218 B.C.\r\n\r\nTHE PUNIC WARS\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Italy made Rome one of the five leading states of the\r\nMediterranean world. In the East there were the kingdoms of Macedonia,\r\nSyria, and Egypt, which had inherited the dominions of Alexander the\r\nGreat. In the West there were Carthage and Rome, once in friendly\r\nalliance, but now to become the bitterest foes. Rome had scarcely reached\r\nthe headship of united Italy before she was involved in a life-and-death\r\nstruggle with this rival power. The three wars between them are known as\r\nthe Punic wars; they are the most famous contests that ancient history\r\nrecords; and they ended in the complete destruction of Carthage.\r\n\r\nFOUNDATION OF CARTHAGE\r\n\r\nMore than a century before the traditional date at which Rome rose upon\r\nher seven hills, Phoenician colonists laid the foundations of a second\r\nTyre. The new city occupied an admirable site, for it bordered on rich\r\nfarming land and had the largest harbor of the north African coast. A\r\nposition at the junction of the eastern and western basins of the\r\nMediterranean gave it unsurpassed opportunities for trade. At the same\r\ntime Carthage was far enough away to be out of the reach of Persian or\r\nMacedonian conquerors.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL EMPIRE OF CARTHAGE\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the third century B.C. the Carthaginians had formed an\r\nimposing commercial empire. Their African dominions included the strip of\r\ncoast from Cyrene westward to the strait of Gibraltar. Their colonies\r\ncovered the shores of Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and southern Spain. The\r\nwestern half of the Mediterranean had become a Carthaginian lake.\r\n\r\nCARTHAGINIAN CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nBefore the opening of the Punic wars Carthage had been much enlarged by\r\nemigrants from Tyre, after the capture of that city by Alexander. [2] The\r\nPhoenician colonists kept their own language, customs, and beliefs and did\r\nnot mingle with the native African peoples. Carthage in form was a\r\nrepublic, but the real power lay in the hands of one hundred men, selected\r\nfrom the great merchant families. It was a government by capitalists who\r\ncared very little for the welfare of the poor freemen and slaves over whom\r\nthey ruled. The wealth of Carthage enabled her to raise huge armies of\r\nmercenary soldiers and to build warships which in size, number, and\r\nequipment surpassed those of any other Mediterranean state. Mistress of a\r\nwide realm, strong both by land and sea, Carthage was now to prove herself\r\nRome's most dangerous foe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLUMN OF DUILIUS (RESTORED)\r\nThe Roman admiral, Duilius, who won a great victory in 260 B.C., was\r\nhonored by a triumphal column set up in the Forum. The monument was\r\nadorned with the brazen beaks of the captured Carthaginian vessels. Part\r\nof the inscription, reciting the achievements of the Roman fleet, has been\r\npreserved.]\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE FIRST PUNIC WAR\r\n\r\nThe First Punic War was a contest for Sicily. The Carthaginians aimed to\r\nestablish their rule over that island, which from its situation seems to\r\nbelong almost as much to Africa as to Italy. But Rome, having become\r\nsupreme in Italy, also cast envious eyes on Sicily. She believed, too,\r\nthat the Carthaginians, if they should conquer Sicily, would sooner or\r\nlater invade southern Italy. The fear for her possessions, as well as the\r\ndesire to gain new ones, led Rome to fling down the gage of battle.\r\n\r\nCOURSE AND RESULTS OF THE WAR, 264-241 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe contest between the two rival states began in 264 B.C. and lasted\r\nnearly twenty-four years. The Romans overran Sicily and even made an\r\nunsuccessful invasion of Africa, but the main struggle was on the sea.\r\nHere at first the Romans were at a disadvantage, for they had no ships as\r\nlarge and powerful as those of the Carthaginians. With characteristic\r\nenergy, however, they built several great war fleets and finally won a\r\ncomplete victory over the enemy. The treaty of peace provided that\r\nCarthage should abandon Sicily, return all prisoners without ransom, and\r\npay a heavy indemnity.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERVAL OF PREPARATION, 241-218 B.C.\r\n\r\nCarthage, though beaten, had not been humbled. She had lost Sicily and the\r\ncommercial monopoly of the Mediterranean. But she was not ready to abandon\r\nall hope of recovering her former supremacy. The peace amounted to no more\r\nthan an armed truce. Both parties were well aware that the real conflict\r\nwas yet to come. The war, however, was delayed for nearly a quarter of a\r\ncentury. During this interval Rome strengthened her military position by\r\nseizing the islands of Sardinia and Corsica from Carthage and by\r\nconquering the Gauls in the Po valley. The Carthaginians, meanwhile, began\r\nto create a new empire in Spain, whose silver mines would supply fresh\r\nmeans for another contest and whose hardy tribes would furnish soldiers as\r\ngood as the Roman legionaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n57. HANNIBAL AND THE GREAT PUNIC WAR, 218-201 B.C.\r\n\r\nBEGINNING OF THE SECOND PUNIC WAR, 218 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe steady advance of the Carthaginian arms in Spain caused much\r\nuneasiness in Rome and at length led that city to declare war. Carthage\r\nherself was not unwilling for a second trial of strength. Her leading\r\ngeneral, Hannibal, who had been winning renown in Spain, believed that the\r\nCarthaginians were now in a position to wage an aggressive war against\r\ntheir mighty rival. And so the two great Mediterranean powers, each\r\nconfident of success, renewed the struggle for supremacy.\r\n\r\nHANNIBAL\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the conflict Hannibal was not quite twenty-seven years\r\nof age. While yet a mere child, so the story went, his father had led him\r\nto the altar, and bade him swear by the Carthaginian gods eternal enmity\r\nto Rome. He followed his father to Spain and there learned all the duties\r\nof a soldier. As a master of the art of war, he ranks with Alexander the\r\nGreat. The Macedonian king conquered the world for the glory of conquest;\r\nHannibal, burning with patriotism, fought to destroy the power which had\r\nhumbled his native land. He failed; and his failure left Carthage weaker\r\nthan he found her. Few men have possessed a more dazzling genius than\r\nHannibal, but his genius was not employed for the lasting good of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nHANNIBAL'S INVASION OF ITALY\r\n\r\nThe Romans planned to conduct the war in Spain and Africa, at a distance\r\nfrom their own shores. Hannibal's bold movements totally upset these\r\ncalculations. The Carthaginian general had determined that the conflict\r\nshould take place in the Italian peninsula itself. Since Roman fleets now\r\ncontrolled the Mediterranean, it was necessary for Hannibal to lead his\r\narmy, with its supplies, equipment, and beasts of burden, by the long and\r\ndangerous land route from Spain to Italy. In the summer of 218 B.C.\r\nHannibal set out from Spain with a large force of infantry and cavalry,\r\nbesides a number of elephants. Beyond the river Ebro he found himself in\r\nhostile territory, through which the soldiers had to fight their way. To\r\nforce the passage of the Pyrenees and the Alps cost him more than half his\r\noriginal army. When, after a five months' march he stood on the soil of\r\nItaly, Hannibal had scarcely twenty-five thousand troops with which to\r\nmeet the immense power of Rome--a power that, given time, could muster to\r\nher defense more than half a million disciplined soldiers.\r\n\r\nFIRST VICTORIES OF HANNIBAL\r\n\r\nThe Romans were surprised by the boldness and rapidity of Hannibal's\r\nmovements. They had expected to conduct the war far away in foreign lands;\r\nthey now knew that they must fight for their own homes and firesides. The\r\nfirst battles were complete victories for the Carthaginians and opened the\r\nroad to Rome. Hannibal's plans, however, did not include a siege of the\r\ncapital. He would not shatter his victorious army in an assault on a\r\nfortified town. Hannibal's real object was to bring the Italians over to\r\nhis side, to ruin Rome through the revolts of her allies. But now he\r\nlearned, apparently for the first time, that Italy was studded with Latin\r\ncolonies, [3] each a miniature Rome, each prepared to resist to the bitter\r\nend. Not a single city opened its gates to the invader. On such solid\r\nfoundations rested Roman rule in Italy.\r\n\r\nA DICTATORSHIP\r\n\r\nThe Senate faced the crisis with characteristic energy. New forces were\r\nraised and intrusted to a dictator, [4] Quintus Fabius Maximus. He refused\r\nto meet Hannibal in a pitched battle, but followed doggedly his enemy's\r\nfootsteps, meanwhile drilling his soldiers to become a match for the\r\nCarthaginian veterans. This strategy was little to the taste of the Roman\r\npopulace, who nicknamed Fabius _Cunctator_, \"the Laggard.\" However, it\r\ngave Rome a brief breathing space, until her preparations to crush the\r\ninvader should be completed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CARTHAGINAN OR ROMAN HELMET (British Museum, London)\r\nFound on the battle field of Cannae.]\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF CANNAE, 316 B.C.\r\n\r\nAfter the term of Fabius as dictator had expired, new consuls were chosen.\r\nThey commanded the largest army Rome had ever put in the field. The\r\nopposing forces met at Cannae in Apulia. The Carthaginians numbered less\r\nthan fifty thousand men; the Romans had more than eighty thousand troops.\r\nHannibal's sole superiority lay in his cavalry, which was posted on the\r\nwings with the infantry occupying the space between. Hannibal's center was\r\nweak and gave way before the Romans, who fought this time massed in solid\r\ncolumns. The arrangement was a poor one, for it destroyed the mobility of\r\nthe legions. The Roman soldiers, having pierced the enemy's lines, now\r\nfound themselves exposed on both flanks to the African infantry and taken\r\nin the rear by Hannibal's splendid cavalry. The battle ended in a hideous\r\nbutchery. One of the consuls died fighting bravely to the last; the other\r\nescaped from the field and with the wreck of his army fled to Rome. A\r\nPunic commander who survived such a disaster would have perished on the\r\ncross; the Roman commander received the thanks of the Senate \"for not\r\ndespairing of the republic.\" [5]\r\n\r\nAFTER CANNAE\r\n\r\nThe battle of Cannae marks the summit of Hannibal's career. He maintained\r\nhimself in Italy for thirteen years thereafter, but the Romans, taught by\r\nbitter experience, refused another engagement with their foe. Hannibal's\r\narmy was too small and too poorly equipped with siege engines for a\r\nsuccessful attack on Rome. His brother, Hasdrubal, led strong\r\nreinforcements from Spain to Italy, but these were caught and destroyed\r\nbefore they could effect a junction with Hannibal's troops. Meanwhile the\r\nbrilliant Roman commander, Publius Scipio, drove the Carthaginians from\r\nSpain and invaded Africa. Hannibal was summoned from Italy to face this\r\nnew adversary. He came, and on the field of Zama (202 B.C.) met his first\r\nand only defeat. Scipio, the victor, received the proud surname,\r\n_Africanus_.\r\n\r\nPEACE IN 201 B.C.\r\n\r\nExhausted Carthage could now do no more than sue for peace on any terms\r\nthat Rome was willing to grant. In the hour of defeat she still trusted\r\nher mighty soldier, and it was Hannibal who conducted the final\r\nnegotiations. The conditions of peace were severe enough. The\r\nCarthaginians gave up Spain and all their ships except ten triremes. They\r\nwere saddled with a huge indemnity and bound to engage in no war without\r\nthe consent of Rome. Carthage thus became a dependent ally of the Roman\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nVICTORIOUS ROME\r\n\r\nIn describing the course and outcome of the Second Punic War our\r\nsympathies naturally go out to the heroic figure of Hannibal, who fought\r\nso long and so bravely for his native land. It is clear, however, that\r\nRome's victory in the gigantic struggle was essential to the continued\r\nprogress of classical civilization. The triumph of Carthage in the third\r\ncentury, like that of Persia in the fifth century, [6] must have resulted\r\nin the spread of Oriental ideas and customs throughout the Mediterranean.\r\nFrom this fate Rome saved Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n58. ROMAN SUPREMACY IN THE WEST AND IN THE EAST, 201-133 B.C.\r\n\r\nTHIRD PUNIC WAR BEGUN, 148 B.C.\r\n\r\nCarthage had been humbled, but not destroyed. She still enjoyed the\r\nadvantages of her magnificent situation and continued to be a competitor\r\nof Rome for the trade of the Mediterranean. The Romans watched with\r\njealousy the reviving strength of the Punic city and at last determined to\r\nblot it out of existence. In 149 B.C. a large army was landed in Africa,\r\nand the inhabitants of Carthage were ordered to remove ten miles from the\r\nsea. They resolved to perish in the ruins of their capital, rather than\r\nobey such a cruel command.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TESTUDO\r\nA relief from the Column of Trajan, Rome. The name _testudo_ a tortoise\r\n(shell) was applied to the covering made by a body of soldiers who placed\r\ntheir shields over their heads The shields fitted so closely together that\r\nmen could walk on them and even horses and chariots could be driven over\r\nthem.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, THE EXPANSION OF ROMAN DOMINIONS 264-133 B. C.]\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF CARTHAGE, 146 B.C.\r\n\r\nCarthage held out for three years. The doubtful honor of its capture\r\nbelonged to Scipio Aemilianus, grandson, by adoption, of the victor of\r\nZama. For seven days the legionaries fought their way, street by street,\r\nhouse by house, until only fifty thousand inhabitants were left to\r\nsurrender to the tender mercies of the Romans. The Senate ordered that the\r\ncity should be burned and that its site should be plowed up and dedicated\r\nto the infernal gods. Such was the end of the most formidable rival Rome\r\never met in her career of conquest. [7]\r\n\r\nSICILY\r\n\r\nThe two European countries, Sicily and Spain, which Rome had taken from\r\nCarthage, presented to the conqueror very different problems. Sicily had\r\nbeen long accustomed to foreign masters. Its civilized and peace-loving\r\ninhabitants were as ready to accept Roman rule as, in the past, they had\r\naccepted the rule of Greeks and Carthaginians. Every year the island\r\nbecame more and more a part of Italy and of Rome.\r\n\r\nSPAIN\r\n\r\nSpain, on the contrary, gave the Romans some hard fighting. The wild\r\nSpanish tribes loved their liberty, and in their mountain fastnesses long\r\nkept up a desperate struggle for independence. It was not until the Romans\r\nsent Scipio Aemilianus to Spain that the Spanish resistance was finally\r\novercome (133 B.C.).\r\n\r\nROMANIZATION OF SPAIN\r\n\r\nAll Spain, except the inaccessible mountain district in the northwest, now\r\nbecame Roman territory. Many colonists settled there; traders and\r\nspeculators flocked to seaports; even the legionaries, quartered in Spain\r\nfor long periods, married Spanish wives and, on retiring from active\r\nservice, made their homes in the peninsula. Rome thus continued in Spain\r\nthe process of Romanization which she had begun in Italy. [8] She was to\r\nrepeat this process in Gaul and Britain. [9] Her way was prepared by the\r\nsword; but after the sword came civilization.\r\n\r\nROME AND MACEDONIA\r\n\r\nWhile Rome was subduing the West, she was also extending her influence\r\nover the highly civilized peoples of the East. Roman interference in the\r\naffairs of Macedonia found an excuse in the attempt of that country,\r\nduring the Second Punic War, to give aid to Hannibal. It was a fateful\r\nmoment when, for the second time, the legion faced the phalanx. The easy\r\nvictory over Macedonia showed that this Hellenistic kingdom was no match\r\nfor the Italian republic. Macedonia was finally made into a subject state\r\nor province of Rome. Thus disappeared a great power, which Philip had\r\nfounded and which Alexander had led to the conquest of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STORMING A CITY (RECONSTRUCTION)]\r\n\r\nROME AND GREECE\r\n\r\nHaving subdued Macedonia, Rome proclaimed Greece a free state. But this\r\n\"freedom\" really meant subjection, as was amply proved when some of the\r\nGreek cities rose in revolt against Roman domination. The heavy hand of\r\nRoman vengeance especially descended on Corinth, at this time one of the\r\nmost beautiful cities of the world. In 146 B.C., the same year in which\r\nthe destruction of Carthage occurred, Corinth was sacked and burned to the\r\nground. [10] The fall of Corinth may be said to mark the final extinction\r\nof Greek liberty. Though the Hellenic cities and states were allowed to\r\nrule themselves, they paid tribute and thus acknowledged the supremacy of\r\nRome. A century later, Greece became in name, as well as in fact, a\r\nprovince of the Roman Empire. [11]\r\n\r\nROME AND SYRIA\r\n\r\nRome, in the meantime, was drawn into a conflict with the kingdom of\r\nSyria. That Asiatic power proved to be no more capable than Macedonia of\r\nchecking the Roman advance. The Syrian king had to give up the greater\r\npart of his possessions in Asia Minor. The western part of the peninsula,\r\ntogether with the Greek cities on the coast, was formed in 133 B.C. into\r\nthe province of Asia. Thus the same year that witnessed the complete\r\nestablishment of Roman rule in Spain saw Rome gain her first possessions\r\nat the opposite end of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL SITUATION IN 133 B.C.\r\n\r\nRoman supremacy over the Mediterranean world was now all but complete. In\r\n264 B.C. Rome had been only one of the five great Mediterranean states. In\r\n133 B.C. no other power existed to match its strength with that of Rome.\r\nTo her had fallen in the West the heritage of Carthage, in the East the\r\nheritage of Alexander. Rome had built up this mighty empire at a terrible\r\ncost in blood and treasure. Let us see what use she was to make of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n59. THE MEDITERRANEAN WORLD UNDER ROMAN RULE\r\n\r\nCREATION OF THE PROVINCIAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\nRome's dealings with the new dependencies across the sea did not follow\r\nthe methods that had proved so successful in Italy. The Italian peoples\r\nhad been treated with great liberality. Rome regarded them as allies,\r\nexempted them from certain taxes, and in many instances gave them Roman\r\ncitizenship. It did not seem possible to extend this wise policy to remote\r\nand often barbarous lands beyond the borders of Italy. Rome adopted,\r\ninstead, much the same system of imperial rule that had been previously\r\nfollowed by Persia and by Athens. [12] She treated the foreign peoples\r\nfrom Spain to Asia as subjects and made her conquered territories into\r\nprovinces. [13] Their inhabitants were compelled to pay tribute and to\r\naccept the oversight of Roman officials.\r\n\r\nEVILS OF THE PROVINCIAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\nAs the Romans came more and more to relish the opportunities for plunder\r\nafforded by a wealthy province, its inhabitants were often wretchedly\r\nmisgoverned. Many governors of the conquered lands were corrupt and\r\ngrasping men. They tried to wring all the money they could from their\r\nhelpless subjects. To the extortions of the governors must be added those\r\nof the tax collectors, whose very name of \"publican\" [14] became a byword\r\nfor all that was rapacious and greedy. In this first effort to manage the\r\nworld she had won, Rome had certainly made a failure. A city-state could\r\nnot rule, with justice and efficiency, an empire.\r\n\r\nTHE PROFITS OF CONQUEST\r\n\r\nIn the old days, before Rome entered on a career of foreign conquest, her\r\ncitizens were famous among men for their love of country, their simple\r\nlives, and their conservative, old-fashioned ways. They worked hard on\r\ntheir little farms, fought bravely in the legions, and kept up with\r\ncareful piety all the ceremonies of their religion. But now the Roman\r\nrepublic was an imperial power with all the privileges of universal rule.\r\nHer foreign wars proved to be immensely profitable. At the end of a\r\nsuccessful campaign the soldiers received large gifts from their general,\r\nbesides the booty taken from the enemy. The Roman state itself profited\r\nfrom the sale of enslaved prisoners and their property. Large sums of\r\nmoney were sometimes seized and taken to Rome. When once peace had been\r\nmade, the Roman governors and tax collectors followed in the wake of the\r\narmies and squeezed the provincials at every turn. The Romans, indeed,\r\nseem to have conquered the world less for glory than for profit.\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF LUXURY\r\n\r\nSo much wealth poured into Rome from every side that there could scarcely\r\nfail to be a sudden growth of luxurious tastes. Rich nobles quickly\r\ndeveloped a relish for all sorts of reckless display. They built fine\r\nhouses adorned with statues, costly paintings, and furnishings. They\r\nsurrounded themselves with troops of slaves. Instead of plain linen\r\nclothes they and their wives wore garments of silk and gold. At their\r\nbanquets they spread embroidered carpets, purple coverings, and dishes of\r\ngilt plate. Pomp and splendor replaced the rude simplicity of an earlier\r\nage.\r\n\r\nDISAPPEARANCE OF THE PEASANTRY\r\n\r\nBut if the rich were becoming richer, it seems that the poor were also\r\nbecoming poorer. After Rome became mistress of the Mediterranean, her\r\nmarkets were flooded with the cheap wheat raised in the provinces,\r\nespecially in those granaries, Sicily and Africa. The price of wheat fell\r\nso low that Roman peasants could not raise enough to support their\r\nfamilies and pay their taxes. When agriculture became unprofitable, the\r\nfarmer was no longer able to remain on the soil. He had to sell out, often\r\nat a ruinous sacrifice. His land was bought by capitalists, who turned\r\nmany small fields into vast sheep pastures and cattle ranches. Gangs of\r\nslaves, laboring under the lash, gradually took the place of the old Roman\r\npeasantry, the very strength of the state. Not unjust was the famous\r\nremark, \"Great domains ruined Italy.\" [15]\r\n\r\nTHE EXODUS OF THE CITIES\r\n\r\nThe decline of agriculture and the disappearance of the small farmer under\r\nthe stress of foreign competition may be studied in modern England as well\r\nas in ancient Italy. Nowadays an English farmer, under the same\r\ncircumstances, will often emigrate to America or to Australia, where land\r\nis cheap and it is easy to make a living. But these Roman peasants did not\r\ncare to go abroad and settle on better soil in Spain or in Africa. They\r\nthronged, instead, to the cities, to Rome especially, where they labored\r\nfor a small wage, fared plainly on wheat bread, and dwelt in huge lodging\r\nhouses, three or four stories high.\r\n\r\nTHE CITY MOB\r\n\r\nWe know very little about this poorer population of Rome. They must have\r\nlived from hand to mouth. Since their votes controlled elections, [16]\r\nthey were courted by candidates for office and kept from grumbling by\r\nbeing fed and amused. Such poor citizens, too lazy for steady work, too\r\nintelligent to starve, formed, with the other riffraff of a great city,\r\nthe elements of a dangerous mob. And the mob, henceforth, plays an ever-\r\nlarger part in the history of the times.\r\n\r\nHELLENIC INFLUENCE AT ROME\r\n\r\nWe must not imagine, however, that all the changes in Roman life worked\r\nfor evil. If the Romans were becoming more luxurious, they were likewise\r\ngaining in culture. The conquests which brought Rome in touch, first with\r\nMagna Graecia and Sicily, then with Greece itself and the Hellenic East,\r\nprepared the way for the entrance of Hellenism. Roman soldiers and traders\r\ncarried back to Italy an acquaintance with Greek customs and ideas.\r\nThousands of cultivated Greeks, some as slaves, others as freemen, settled\r\nin the capital as actors, physicians, artists, and writers. There they\r\nintroduced the Greek language, as well as the religion, literature, and\r\nart of their native land. Roman nobles of the better type began to take an\r\ninterest in other things than simply farming, commerce, or war. They\r\nimitated Greek fashions in dress and manners, collected Greek books, and\r\nfilled their homes with the productions of Greek artists. Henceforth every\r\naspect of Roman society felt the quickening influence of the older, richer\r\nculture of the Hellenic world. It was a Roman poet who wrote, \"Captive\r\nGreece captured her conqueror rude.\" [17]\r\n\r\n\r\n60. THE GRACCHI\r\n\r\nTIBERIUS AND GAIUS GRACCHUS\r\n\r\nIn 133 B.C., a year otherwise made memorable by the final subjugation of\r\nSpain and the acquisition of Asia, efforts began Rome to remedy some of\r\nthe disorders which were now seen to be sapping the strength of Roman\r\nsociety. The first persons to undertake the work of reform were the two\r\nbrothers, Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus. The Gracchi belonged to the highest\r\nnobility of Rome. Their father had filled a consulship and a censorship\r\nand had celebrated triumphs. Cornelia, their mother, was a daughter of\r\nScipio Africanus, the conqueror of Hannibal. A fine type of the Roman\r\nmatron, she called her boys her \"jewels,\" more precious than gold, and\r\nbrought them up to love their country better than their own lives.\r\nTiberius, the elder brother, was only thirty years of age when he became a\r\ntribune and began his career in Roman politics.\r\n\r\nAGRARIAN LAW OF TIBERIUS GRACCHUS\r\n\r\nTiberius signalized his election to the tribunate by bringing forward his\r\ncelebrated agrarian law. He proposed that the public lands of Rome, then\r\nlargely occupied by wealthy men who alone had the money necessary to work\r\nthem with cattle and slaves, should be reclaimed by the state, divided\r\ninto small tracts, and given to the poorer citizens. By getting the people\r\nback again on the soil, Tiberius hoped to revive the declining agriculture\r\nof Italy.\r\n\r\nDEFECTS OF THE AGRARIAN LAW\r\n\r\nThis agrarian law, though well intentioned, did not go to the root of the\r\nreal difficulty--foreign competition. No legislation could have helped the\r\nfarming class, except import duties to keep out the cheap grain from\r\nabroad. But the idle mob at Rome, controlling the assemblies, would never\r\nhave voted in favor of taxing their food, thus making it more expensive.\r\nAt the same time the proposal to take away part of the public domains from\r\nits possessors roused a hornet's nest about the reformer's ears. Rich\r\npeople had occupied the public land for so long that they had come to look\r\nupon it as really their own. They would be very sure to oppose such a\r\nmeasure. Poor people, of course, welcomed a scheme which promised to give\r\nthem farms for nothing. Tiberius even wished to use the public funds to\r\nstock the farms of his new peasantry. This would have been a mischievous\r\nact of state philanthropy.\r\n\r\nFAILURE AND DEATH OF TIBERIUS, 133 B.C.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these defects in his measure, Tiberius urged its passage with\r\nfiery eloquence. But the great landowners in the Senate got another\r\ntribune, devoted to their interests, to place his veto [18] on the\r\nproposed legislation. The impatient Tiberius at once took a revolutionary\r\nstep. Though a magistrate could not legally be removed from office,\r\nTiberius had the offending tribune deposed and dragged from his seat. The\r\nlaw was then passed without further opposition. This action of Tiberius\r\nplaced him clearly in the wrong. The aristocrats threatened to punish him\r\nas soon as his term of office was over. To avoid impeachment Tiberius\r\nsought reelection to the tribunate for the following year. This, again,\r\nwas contrary to custom, since no one might hold office for two successive\r\nterms. On the day appointed for the election, while voting was in\r\nprogress, a crowd of angry senators burst into the Forum and killed\r\nTiberius, together with three hundred of his followers. Both sides had now\r\nbegun to display an utter disregard for law. Force and bloodshed,\r\nhenceforth, were to help decide political disputes.\r\n\r\nGAIUS GRACCHUS BECOMES TRIBUNE, 123 B.C.\r\n\r\nTiberius Gracchus, in his efforts to secure economic reform, had\r\nunwittingly provoked a conflict between the Senate and the assemblies. Ten\r\nyears after his death, his brother, Gaius Gracchus, came to the front.\r\nGaius quickly made himself a popular leader with the set purpose of\r\nremodeling the government of Rome. He found in the tribunate an office\r\nfrom which to work against the Senate. After the death of Tiberius a law\r\nhad been passed permitting a man to hold the position of tribune year\r\nafter year. Gaius intended to be a sort of perpetual tribune, and to rule\r\nthe Roman assemblies very much as Pericles had ruled the people at Athens.\r\n[19] One of his first measures was a law permitting the sale of grain from\r\nthe public storehouses to Roman citizens at about half the market price.\r\nThis measure, of course, won over the city mob, but it must be regarded as\r\nvery unwise. It saddled the treasury with a heavy burden, and later the\r\ngovernment had to furnish the grain for nothing. Indiscriminate charity of\r\nthis sort increased, rather than lessened, the number of paupers.\r\n\r\nMEASURES OF GAIUS TO RELIEVE THE POOR\r\n\r\nHaving won popular support, Gaius was able to secure the additional\r\nlegislation which he deemed necessary to carry out his brother's work. He\r\nreenacted the land laws for the benefit of the peasantry and furnished\r\nwork for the unemployed by building roads throughout Italy. He also began\r\nto establish colonies of poor citizens, both in Italy and in the\r\nprovinces. This was a wise policy. Had it been allowed to continue, such\r\nstate-assisted emigration, by providing the landless poor of Italy with\r\nfarms abroad, would have relieved the economic distress of the peninsula.\r\n\r\nAN EFFORT TO EXTEND ROMAN CITIZENSHIP\r\n\r\nGaius now came forward with another measure which marked him as an able\r\nand prudent statesman. He proposed to bestow the right of voting in the\r\nRoman assemblies upon the inhabitants of the Latin colonies. [20] He\r\nthought, also, that the Italian allies should be allowed to intermarry\r\nwith Romans and hold property under the protection of the Roman law. No\r\ndoubt Gaius believed that the time might come when all the Italian peoples\r\nwould be citizens of Rome. This time did come, thirty years later, but\r\nonly after a terrible war that nearly ruined Rome.\r\n\r\nFAILURE AND DEATH OF GAIUS, 121 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe effort by Gaius to extend Roman citizenship cost the reformer all his\r\nhard-won popularity. It aroused the jealousy of the selfish city mob,\r\nwhich believed that the entrance of so many new citizens would mean the\r\nloss of its privileges. There would not be so many free shows and so much\r\ncheap grain. So the people rejected the measure and, turning from their\r\nformer favorite, failed to reëlect him to the tribunate. When Gaius was no\r\nlonger protected by the sanctity of the tribune's office, [21] he fell an\r\neasy victim to senatorial hatred. Another bloody tumult broke out, in\r\nwhich Gaius and three thousand of his followers perished. The consul who\r\nquelled the disturbance erected at the head of the Forum a temple to\r\nHarmony (_Concordia_).\r\n\r\nTHE GRACCHI BEGIN THE REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nThe pathetic career of the Gracchi had much significance in Roman history.\r\nThey were the unconscious sponsors of a revolutionary movement which did\r\nnot end until the republic had come under the rule of one man. They failed\r\nbecause they put their trust in the support of the Roman mob. Future\r\nagitators were to appear with the legionaries at their heels.\r\n\r\n\r\n61. MARIUS AND SULLA\r\n\r\nMARIUS AND THE JUGURTHINE WAR, 112-106 B.C.\r\n\r\nAlthough Rome now ruled throughout the Mediterranean, she was constantly\r\nengaged in border wars in one corner or another of her wide dominions.\r\nThese wars brought to the front new military leaders, of whom the first\r\nwas Gaius Marius. He was a peasant's son, a coarse, rude soldier, but an\r\nhonest, courageous, and able man. Marius rose to prominence in the so-\r\ncalled Jugurthine War, which the Romans were waging against Jugurtha, king\r\nof Numidia. That wily African had discovered that it was easier to bribe\r\nthe Roman commanders than to fight them; and the contest dragged on in\r\ndisgraceful fashion year after year. Marius at last persuaded the people\r\nto elect him consul and intrust him with the conduct of the war. By\r\ngeneralship and good fortune he speedily concluded the struggle and\r\nbrought Jugurtha in chains to Rome.\r\n\r\nMARIUS AND THE WAR WITH THE GERMANS, 102-101 B.C.\r\n\r\nA few years later Marius had another opportunity to win distinction. He\r\nbecame the defender of Rome and Italy against a dangerous invasion of\r\nGermanic barbarians, who were ravaging Transalpine Gaul and the Po Valley.\r\nThe decisive victories which Marius gained over them removed a grave\r\ndanger which threatened the Roman world. The time had not yet come for\r\nancient civilization to be submerged under a wave of barbarism.\r\n\r\nSULLA AND THE SOCIAL WAR, 90-88 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe second military leader whom this troubled period brought forth was\r\nLucius Cornelius Sulla. He was a man of noble birth, and with his social\r\ngifts, his appreciation of art and letters, his knowledge of men and the\r\nworld, presented a sharp contrast to Marius. Sulla's great abilities\r\nquickly brought him into public notice; he rose rapidly from one office to\r\nanother; and in the Social War showed his skill as a commander. This\r\nstruggle was the consequence of Rome's refusal to grant the rights of\r\ncitizenship to her Italian allies. The strength of the rebellion lay among\r\nthe Samnites and other peoples of central and southern Italy. The war came\r\nto an end only when Rome promised the franchise to all Italians who\r\nreturned to their allegiance. Before many years had passed, the\r\ninhabitants of nearly all the Italian towns south of the Rubicon River\r\nreceived Roman citizenship. It was this same wise policy of making\r\nconquered peoples equal with herself that afterwards led Rome to grant\r\ncitizenship to the inhabitants of the provinces. [22]\r\n\r\nSULLA AND THE MITHRADATIC WAR, 88-84 B.C.\r\n\r\nWhat military honors were gained in the struggle belonged to Sulla. His\r\nreward was the consulship and an appointment as general in still another\r\nconflict which distracted Rome had to face. While that city had been busy\r\nwith civil enemies and barbarian foes, a powerful state, known as Pontus,\r\nhad been growing up in Asia Minor. Its king, Mithradates, overran the\r\nRoman provinces in the Orient and threatened to annex them to his own\r\nkingdom. But Sulla, with greatly inferior forces, compelled Mithradates to\r\nabandon his conquests, surrender his fleet, and pay a large indemnity. If\r\nMarius had the honor of repelling the barbarian invasion of the West,\r\nSulla had the honor of preserving Rome's possessions in the East.\r\n\r\nRIVALRY OF MARIUS AND SULLA\r\n\r\nMarius and Sulla were rivals not only in war but also in politics. Sulla\r\nnaturally espoused the aristocratic cause and stood as the champion of the\r\nSenate. Marius just as naturally became the head of the democratic party.\r\nThe rivalry between the two leaders finally led to civil war. During\r\nSulla's absence in the East the democrats got the upper hand at Rome and\r\nrevenged themselves by murdering their political foes among the\r\naristocrats. The reign of terror ended only with the sudden death of\r\nMarius, just after he had been elected to his seventh consulship. A few\r\nyears later Sulla returned to Italy with his army and defeated the\r\ndemocrats in a great battle outside the Colline Gate of Rome. Sulla\r\nsignalized his victory by ordering the assassination of every prominent\r\nman in the democratic party.\r\n\r\nSULLA AS \"PERPETUAL DICTATOR\"\r\n\r\nSulla regarded this legalized butchery as a necessary step in his self-\r\nappointed task of putting the Roman government once more to rights. He now\r\nreceived the title of \"Perpetual Dictator,\" with complete authority to\r\ngovern the state until the new order of things should be established. Rome\r\nthus came under the rule of one man for the first time since the expulsion\r\nof the kings.\r\n\r\nSULLA'S DEATH, 78 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe various measures by which Sulla intrenched the Senate in power did not\r\nlong survive his death and hence had no lasting influence on Roman\r\npolitics. After a rule of three years Sulla voluntarily gave up the\r\ndictatorship and retired to his villa on the bay of Naples. He died a few\r\nmonths later. The Senate honored him with a public funeral, the most\r\nsplendid that Rome had ever seen. His monument bore an inscription which\r\nthe dictator himself is said to have composed: \"No friend ever did him a\r\nkindness and no enemy, a wrong, without being fully repaid.\" [23] That was\r\none epitaph which told the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n62. POMPEY AND CAESAR\r\n\r\nRISE OF POMPEY\r\n\r\nThe struggle between Marius and Sulla, decided as it was by the sword,\r\nmarks a stage in the decline of the Roman Republic. The careers of these\r\ntwo men showed how easily the state could be ruled by a successful\r\ncommander who had his soldiers behind him. After Sulla's death his friend\r\nPompey became the leading figure in Roman politics. Pompey's first service\r\nwas in Spain, where the adherents of Marius sought to humble the Senate\r\nand the aristocratic party by encouraging the Spaniards to rise against\r\nRoman rule. Having crushed this rebellion, Pompey returned to Italy in\r\ntime to take part in putting down a formidable insurrection of slaves,\r\noutlaws, and ruined peasants. He was next intrusted with the war against\r\nthe pirates, who swarmed in the Mediterranean, preyed on commerce, and\r\nplundered wealthy cities near the coast. Brilliant success in clearing the\r\nseas of these marauders led to his being sent to the East to end the war\r\nwith Mithradates, who was once more in arms against Rome. Pompey drove the\r\nPontic monarch from his kingdom and then annexed Syria to the Roman\r\ndominions. When Pompey returned to Rome in 62 B.C., he brought with him a\r\nreputation as the most successful general of his time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GNAEUS POMPEIUS MAGNUS (Spada Palace, Rome)]\r\n\r\nMARCUS TULLIUS CICERO\r\n\r\nWe have seen how steadily since the days of the Gracchi the Roman state\r\nhad been moving toward the rule of one man. Marius, Sulla, and Pompey each\r\nrepresent a step in the direction of monarchy. Yet there were still able\r\nand patriotic leaders at Rome who believed in the old order of things and\r\ntried their best to uphold the fast-perishing republic. No republican\r\nstatesman was more devoted to the constitution than Cicero. A native of\r\nArpinum, the same Italian town which had already given birth to Marius,\r\nCicero came to Rome a youth without wealth or family influence. He made\r\nhis way into Roman society by his social and conversational powers and by\r\nhis capacity for friendship. His mind had been carefully trained under the\r\ninfluence of Hellenic culture; he had traveled and studied in Greece; and\r\nthroughout life he loved to steal away from the tumult of the Forum and\r\nthe law courts and enjoy the companionship of his books. Though the proud\r\nnobles were inclined to look down on him as a \"new man,\" Cicero's splendid\r\neloquence soon gave him prominence in politics. He ranks in fame as the\r\nsecond orator of antiquity, inferior only to Demosthenes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO (Vatican Museum, Rome)]\r\n\r\nIMPEACHMENT OF VERRES, 70 B.C.\r\n\r\nCicero rose to prominence through his prosecution of Verres, a thieving\r\ngovernor of Sicily. Verres had powerful friends among the nobles at Rome\r\nand counted on his influence and wealth to escape punishment. He openly\r\nboasted that he had plunder enough to live in luxury, even though he had\r\nto surrender two-thirds of it as fees to his lawyers and bribes to the\r\njury. But Verres had not reckoned with the brilliant young advocate who\r\ntook up the cause of the oppressed provincials. Cicero hurried to Sicily\r\nand there collected such an overwhelming mass of evidence that the bare\r\nstatement of the facts was enough to condemn the criminal. Verres went\r\ninto exile. Cicero became the head of the Roman bar. Seven years later he\r\nwas elected consul.\r\n\r\nCONSPIRACY OF CATILINE, 63 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe year of Cicero's consulship was marked by an event which throws a\r\nlurid light on the conditions of the time. Lucius Catiline, a young noble\r\nof ability, but bankrupt in character and purse, organized a conspiracy to\r\nseize Rome, murder the magistrates, and plunder the rich. He gathered\r\nabout himself outlaws of every description, slaves, and starving peasants\r\n--all the discontented and needy classes throughout Italy. He and his\r\nassociates were desperate anarchists who sought to restore their own\r\nbroken fortunes by overturning the government. The spread of the\r\ninsurrection was checked by Cicero's vigorous measures. In a series of\r\nfamous speeches he exposed Catiline's plans to the astounded Senate.\r\nCatiline then fled to his camp in Etruria and shortly afterwards perished\r\nin battle, together with three thousand of his followers. Cicero now\r\ngained fresh popularity and honor. The grateful citizens called him\r\n\"Father of his Country\" (_Pater Patriae_).\r\n\r\nRISE OF CAESAR\r\n\r\nRome at this time held another prominent leader in politics, namely, Gaius\r\nJulius Caesar. He belonged to a noble family, but his father had favored\r\nthe democratic cause and his aunt had married Marius. After Sulla's death\r\nCaesar threw himself with energy into the game of politics at the capital\r\ncity. In these early years the future statesman seems to have been a\r\ndemagogue of the usual type, who sought through the favor of the people a\r\nrapid rise to power. He won the ear of the multitude by his fiery\r\nharangues, his bribes of money, and his gifts of food and public shows.\r\nCaesar's expenditures for such purposes were enormous. Before he was\r\ntwenty-four he had spent all his private fortune. Henceforth he was\r\n\"financed\" by the millionaire Crassus, who lent him the money so necessary\r\nfor a successful career as a politician.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST TRIUMVIRATE, 60 B.C.\r\n\r\nCaesar and Crassus, the two leaders of the democratic party at Rome, now\r\njoined with Pompey in what is called the First Triumvirate. To this \"ring\"\r\nPompey contributed his military reputation, Crassus, his wealth, and\r\nCaesar, his influence over the Roman mob. Supported both by the people and\r\nby the army, these three men were really masters of Rome. An immediate\r\nresult of the First Triumvirate was the appointment of Caesar as governor\r\nof Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GAIUS JULIUS CAESAR (British Museum, London)]\r\n\r\nCAESAR'S CAMPAIGNS IN GAUL, 58-50 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe story of his career in Gaul has been related by Caesar himself in the\r\nfamous _Commentaries_. This book describes a series of military successes\r\nwhich have given the author a place among the world's generals. Caesar\r\noverran Transalpine Gaul, twice bridged the Rhine and invaded Germany,\r\nmade two expeditions to Britain, and brought within the Roman dominions\r\nall the territory bounded by the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Rhine, and the\r\nAtlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nROMANIZATION OF GAUL\r\n\r\nCaesar's conquests in Gaul are more than a chapter in the history of the\r\nart of war. They belong to the history of civilization. Henceforth the\r\nfrontier of prehistoric Europe retreated rapidly to the north. The map of\r\nthe ancient civilized world widened from the Mediterranean basin to the\r\nshores of the Atlantic. Into the conquered lands came the Latin language,\r\nthe Roman law, and the customs and institutions of Rome. Gaul speedily\r\nbecame one of the most flourishing parts of the Roman world. \"Let the Alps\r\nsink,\" exclaimed Cicero, \"the gods raised them to shelter Italy from the\r\nbarbarians, but now they are no longer needed.\"\r\n\r\nDEFEAT AND DEATH OF CRASSUS, 53 B.C.\r\n\r\nDuring Caesar's long absence in Gaul the First Triumvirate was suddenly\r\nended by the death of one of its members. It had been a part of their\r\nbargain in dividing the Roman world that Crassus should have the\r\ngovernment of Syria. But this unlucky general, while aspiring to rival\r\nCaesar's exploits by new conquests beyond the Euphrates, lost his army and\r\nhis life in battle with the Parthians. Besides checking the extension of\r\nthe Roman arms in the remote East, the disaster had its effect on Roman\r\npolitics. It dissolved the triumvirate and prepared the way for that\r\nrivalry between Caesar and Pompey which formed the next step in the\r\ndownward course of the republic.\r\n\r\nGROWING OPPOSITION BETWEEN POMPEY AND CAESAR\r\n\r\nThe two men were now rapidly drawing apart. Pompey grew more and more\r\njealous of Caesar and more and more fearful that the latter was aiming at\r\ndespotic power. He himself had no desire to be king or dictator. He was\r\nequally determined that Caesar should not gain such a position. In this\r\nattitude he had the full support of Cicero and the other members of the\r\nSenate. They saw clearly that the real danger to the state was Caesar, not\r\nPompey.\r\n\r\nCAESAR DECLARES WAR IN THE REPUBLIC, 49 B.C.\r\n\r\nCaesar's command in Gaul was to expire in 49 B.C. The senatorial party\r\ndesired that he should return to Rome without an army. His opponents\r\nintended to prosecute him when he became a private citizen. Caesar had no\r\ninclination to trust himself to their tender mercies and refused to\r\ndisband his legions unless his rival did the same. Finally the Senate,\r\nconscious of Pompey's support, ordered him to lay down his arms on pain of\r\noutlawry. Caesar replied to this challenge of the Senate by leading his\r\ntroops across the Rubicon, the little stream that separated Cisalpine Gaul\r\nfrom Italy. As he plunged into the river, he exclaimed, \"The die is cast.\"\r\n[24] He had now declared war on the republic.\r\n\r\nCAESAR MASTER OF THE WEST\r\n\r\nCaesar's bold movement caught the senatorial party unawares. Pompey could\r\nnot gather his legions before his audacious foe reached Rome. Finding it\r\nimpossible to make a stand in Italy, Pompey, with the consuls and many\r\nsenators, withdrew to Greece. Caesar did not follow him at once. He\r\nhurried to Spain and, after a brilliant campaign only six weeks in length,\r\nbroke down the republican resistance in that peninsula. Having now secured\r\nItaly and Spain, Caesar was free to turn his forces against Pompey in the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, THE EXPANSION OF ROMAN DOMINIONS 133-31 B.C.]\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF PHARSALUS, 48 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe final battle took place on the plain of Pharsalus in Thessaly.\r\nPompey's troops, though nearly twice as numerous as Caesar's, were\r\ndefeated after a severe struggle. Their great leader then fled to Egypt,\r\nonly to be foully murdered. Pompey's head was sent to Caesar, but he\r\nturned from it with horror. Such was the end of an able general and an\r\nhonest man, one who should have lived two hundred years earlier, when Rome\r\nwas still a free state.\r\n\r\nCAESAR IN EGYPT, ASIA MINOR, AND AFRICA, 48-46 B.C.\r\n\r\nAfter Pharsalus there still remained several years of fighting before\r\nCaesar's victory was complete. He made Cleopatra, the beautiful queen of\r\nEgypt, secure in the possession of the throne and brought that country\r\ninto dependence on Rome. He passed through Asia Minor and in one swift\r\ncampaign crushed a revolt headed by the son of Mithridates. The conqueror\r\nsent tidings of his victory in a laconic dispatch: \"I came, I saw, I\r\nconquered.\" [25] After subduing the remnants of the senatorial party in\r\nAfrica, Caesar returned home to crown his exploits by a series of splendid\r\ntriumphs and to enjoy less than two years of untrammeled power.\r\n\r\n\r\n63. THE WORK OF CAESAR\r\n\r\nAUTHORITY AND POSITION OF CAESAR\r\n\r\nThe new government which Caesar brought into being was a monarchy in all\r\nexcept name. He became dictator for life and held other republican\r\noffices, such as the consulship and censorship. He refused the title of\r\nking, but accepted as a civil magistrate the name of _imperator_, [26]\r\nwith which the soldiers had been wont to salute a victorious general.\r\nThough he abolished none of the old republican forms, the Senate became\r\nsimply his advisory council, the assemblies, his submissive agents the\r\nconsuls, praetors and tribunes, his pliant tools. The laurel wreath, the\r\ntriumphal dress, the conqueror's scepter--all proclaimed the autocrat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ROMAN COIN WITH THE HEAD OF JULIUS CAESAR]\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF CAESAR'S RULE\r\n\r\nCaesar used his power wisely and well. No massacres or confiscations\r\nsullied his victory. He treated his former foes with clemency and even\r\nwith kindness. No sooner was domestic tranquillity assured than, with\r\nrestless energy, he entered on a series of far-reaching reforms.\r\n\r\nREFORMS AT ROME AND IN ITALY\r\n\r\nCaesar's measures sought to remove the economic evils which a century of\r\ndiscord had made so manifest. By restricting the monthly distribution of\r\ngrain to those actually in need, he tried to discourage the public charity\r\nwhich was making the capital city a paradise for the idle and the\r\nshiftless. By planning great colonies beyond the sea, notably at Corinth\r\nand Carthage, he sought to provide farms for the landless citizens of\r\nItaly. His active mind even found time for such matters as the\r\ncodification of Roman law, the construction of great public works, and the\r\nimprovement of the coinage and the calendar. [27]\r\n\r\nREFORMATION OF THE PROVINCIAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\nCaesar's reforms in the provinces had an epoch-making character. He\r\nreduced taxes, lessened the burden of their collection, and took into his\r\nown hands the appointment of provincial magistrates. Henceforth oppressive\r\ngovernors and swindling publicans had to expect swift, stern punishment\r\nfrom one whose interests included the welfare of both citizens and\r\nsubjects. By granting Roman citizenship to communities in Gaul and Sicily,\r\nhe indicated his purpose, as rapidly as possible, to convert the\r\nprovincials into Romans. It was Caesar's aim to break down the barriers\r\nbetween Rome and her provinces, to wipe out the distinction between the\r\nconquerors and the conquered.\r\n\r\nASSASSINATION OF CAESAR, 44 B.C.\r\n\r\nCaesar did not live to complete his task. Like that other colossal figure,\r\nAlexander the Great, he perished before his work as a statesman had hardly\r\nmore than begun. On the Ides of March, 44 B.C., he was struck down in the\r\nSenate-house by the daggers of a group of envious and irreconcilable\r\nnobles, headed by Cassius and Brutus. He fell at the foot of Pompey's\r\nstatue, pierced with no less than twenty-three wounds. His body was burnt\r\non a pyre in the Forum, and his friend, Antony, pronounced the funeral\r\neulogy.\r\n\r\nCONSEQUENCES OF CAESAR'S DEATH\r\n\r\nIn the light of all the possibilities of beneficent government which\r\nCaesar was revealing, his cowardly murder becomes one of the most\r\nstupendous follies recorded in history. Caesar's death could not restore\r\nthe republic. It served only to prolong disorder and strife within the\r\nRoman state. As Cicero himself said, hearing the news, \"The tyrant is\r\ndead; the tyranny still lives.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n64. ANTONY AND OCTAVIAN\r\n\r\nANTONY BECOMES CAESAR'S SUCCESSOR\r\n\r\nThe murderers of Caesar called themselves the \"liberators\" of the\r\nrepublic. They thought that all Rome would applaud their deed, but the\r\ncontrary was true. The senatorial order remained lukewarm. The people,\r\ninstead of flocking to their support, mourned the loss of a friend and\r\nbenefactor. Soon the conspirators found themselves in great peril.\r\nCaesar's friend and lieutenant, Antony, who became sole consul after\r\nCaesar's death, quickly made himself master of the situation. Brutus and\r\nCassius were forced to withdraw to the provinces which had been previously\r\nassigned to them by Caesar, leaving Antony to rule Rome as his successor.\r\n\r\nA RIVAL IN THE YOUNG OCTAVIAN\r\n\r\nAntony's hope of reigning supreme was soon disturbed by the appearance of\r\na new rival. Caesar, in his will, had made his grandnephew, Octavian, [28]\r\nhis heir. He now came to Rome to claim the inheritance. In that sickly,\r\nstudious youth people did not at first recognize the masterful personality\r\nhe was soon to exhibit. They rather reëchoed Cicero's sentiment that \"the\r\nyoung man was to be praised, complimented, and got rid of.\" [29] But\r\nOctavian easily made himself a power, winning the populace by paying\r\nCaesar's legacies to them and conciliating the senatorial party by siding\r\nwith it against Antony. Men now began to talk of Octavian as the destined\r\nrestorer of the republic.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND TRIUMVIRATE, 43 B.C.\r\n\r\nOctavian, however, entertained other designs. He had never been sincere in\r\nhis support of the Senate, and the distrustful policy of that body soon\r\nconverted him into an active foe. From fighting Antony, Octavian turned to\r\nalliance with him. The two antagonists made up their differences, and with\r\nLepidus, one of Caesar's lieutenants, as a third ally, marched on Rome at\r\nthe head of their legions. The city fell again under military rule. The\r\nthree men then united in the Second Triumvirate with full authority to\r\ngovern and reorganize the state. The advent of this new tyranny was\r\nsignalized by a butchery almost as bloody as Sulla's. Cicero, who had\r\nincurred the hatred of Antony by his fiery speeches against him, was the\r\nmost illustrious victim. More than two thousand persons, mainly men of\r\nhigh rank, were slain. The triumvirs by this massacre firmly established\r\ntheir rule at Rome and in the West.\r\n\r\nBATTLES OF PHILIPPI, 42 B.C.\r\n\r\nIn the East, where Brutus and Cassius had gathered a formidable force, the\r\ntriumvirs were not to win without a struggle. It took place on the plain\r\nof Philippi in Macedonia. The two battles fought there ended in the\r\nsuicide of the republican leaders and the dispersal of their troops. This\r\nwas the last attempt to restore the republic by force of arms.\r\n\r\nDIVISION OF THE ROMAN WORLD\r\n\r\nThough the republic had been overthrown, it remained to be seen who would\r\nbe master of the new empire, Antony or Octavian. The triumvirate lasted\r\nfor more than ten years, but during this period the incompetent Lepidus\r\nwas set aside by his stronger colleagues. The two remaining members then\r\ndivided between them the Roman world. Octavian took Italy and the West;\r\nAntony took the East, with Alexandria as his capital.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIAN IN THE WEST\r\n\r\nIn the western half of the empire Octavian ruled quietly and with success.\r\nMen were already congratulating themselves on the return of peace under a\r\nsecond Caesar. In a few years Octavian, from an obscure boy of eighteen,\r\nhad grown to be one of the most powerful personalities of his age.\r\n\r\nANTONY IN THE EAST\r\n\r\nIn the eastern half of the empire things did not go so well. Antony was\r\nclever, but fond of luxury and vice. He had married a sister of Octavian,\r\nbut he soon grew tired of her and put her away for the fascinating\r\nCleopatra. [30] The Roman world was startled by tidings that she had been\r\nproclaimed \"queen of kings,\" and that to her and her sons had been given\r\nthe richest provinces in the East. It was even rumored that Cleopatra,\r\nhaving enslaved Antony with her charms, planned to be enthroned as queen\r\nat Rome.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF ACTIUM, 31 B.C.\r\n\r\nAntony's disgraceful conduct aroused the Roman people. They willingly\r\nfollowed Octavian to a war against one who seemed a national enemy. A\r\nnaval battle in the bay of Actium, on the coast of Epirus, decided the\r\nissue. The fight had hardly begun before Cleopatra and Antony sailed away,\r\nleaving their fleet to take care of itself. Octavian pursued the\r\ninfatuated pair into Egypt. Antony committed suicide, and Cleopatra,\r\nrather than be led a captive in a Roman triumph, followed his example.\r\nWith the death of Cleopatra the dynasty of the Ptolemies [31] came to an\r\nend. Egypt henceforth formed a province of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIUMPH OF OCTAVIAN\r\n\r\nOctavian, on his return to Rome, enjoyed the honors of a three days'\r\ntriumph. [32] As the grand parade moved along the Sacred Way through the\r\nForum, and thence to the temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline, men noted\r\nthat the magistrates, instead of heading the procession as was the custom,\r\nfollowed in the conqueror's train. It was a significant change. Octavian,\r\nnot the magistrates of Rome, now ruled the Roman world.\r\n\r\n\r\n65. THE END OF AN EPOCH\r\n\r\nDOOM OF THE REPUBLIC\r\n\r\nThe republic, indeed, was doomed. A hundred years of dissension and civil\r\nwarfare proclaimed clearly enough the failure of the old order. Rome was a\r\ncity-state suddenly called to the responsibilities of universal rule. Both\r\nthe machinery of her government and the morals of her people were\r\ninadequate for so huge a task. The gradual revolution which changed this\r\nRoman city-state into imperial Rome, judged by its results, is perhaps the\r\nmost momentous movement in the annals of mankind. Let us summarize its\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nA CENTURY OF REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nIn 133 B.C. Roman society had been corrupted and enfeebled as the result\r\nof foreign conquests. The supreme power in the state more and more tended\r\nto fall into the hands of a narrow oligarchy--the senatorial nobility. Its\r\ndishonesty and weakness soon led to efforts at reform. The attempts of the\r\nGracchi to overthrow the Senate's position and restore popular sovereignty\r\nended in disaster. Then, in quick succession, arose a series of military\r\nleaders who aimed to secure by the sword what was no longer to be obtained\r\nthrough constitutional and legal means. Marius, a great general but no\r\npolitician, could only break down and destroy. Sulla, a sincere but\r\nnarrow-minded statesman, could do no more than prop up the structure--\r\nalready tottering--of senatorial rule. Pompey soon undid that work and\r\nleft the constitution to become again the sport of rival soldiers. Caesar,\r\ntriumphing over Pompey, gained a position of unchallenged supremacy. After\r\nCaesar's death, imperial power was permanently restored in the person of\r\nOctavian. The battle of Actium in 31 B.C. made Octavian master of the\r\nRoman world.\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE\r\n\r\nBut the Romans were not yet an old and worn-out people. On the ruins of\r\nthe old republican order it was still possible to build up a new imperial\r\nsystem in which good government, peace, and prosperity should prevail for\r\nmore than two centuries. During this period Rome performed her real, her\r\nenduring, work for civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1. Write a summary account (500 words) of Roman expansion 264-133 B.C.\r\n\r\n2.

As this lunar year, like that of the Greeks, was\r\nshorter than the solar year, it had been necessary to intercalate an\r\nadditional month, of varying length, in every alternate year. Caesar\r\nadopted the more accurate Egyptian calendar of 365 days and instituted the\r\nsystem of leap years. His rearrangement made the year 11 minutes, 14\r\nseconds too long. By 1582 A.D. this difference had amounted to nearly 10\r\ndays. Pope Gregory XIII modified the \"Julian Calendar\" by calling Oct. 5,\r\n1582, Oct. 15, and continuing the count 10 days in advance. This\r\n\"Gregorian Calendar\" was adopted by Great Britain in 1752 A.D. and\r\nsubsequently by other Protestant countries. It has not won acceptance in\r\nRussia and Greece. The difference between the two systems--the Old Style\r\nand the New Style--is now about 13 days.\r\n\r\n[28] His name was Octavius, but after his adoption by Caesar he called\r\nhimself Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus.\r\n\r\n[29] Cicero, _Letters_, xix, 20.\r\n\r\n[30] See page 185.\r\n\r\n[31] See page 127.\r\n\r\n[32] See page 160.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY EMPIRE: THE WORLD UNDER ROMAN RULE, 31 B.C.-l80 A.D. [1]\r\n\r\n\r\n66. AUGUSTUS, 31 B.C.-l4 A.D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUGUSTUS (Vatican Museum, Rome)]\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY EMPIRE, 31 B.C.-180 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe period of two hundred and eleven years, between the accession of\r\nAugustus and the death of Marcus Aurelius, is known as the Early Empire.\r\nAs we shall now learn, it was a time of settled government and of internal\r\ntranquillity. Except for a brief period of anarchy at the close of the\r\nreign of Nero, it was also a time of regular succession to the throne.\r\nNearly all the emperors were vigorous and capable rulers. The peace and\r\nprosperity which they gave to the Roman world amply justify--if\r\njustification be needed--the change from republic to empire.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW RULER\r\n\r\nFew persons have set their stamp more indelibly on the pages of history\r\nthan Octavian, whom we may now call by his more familiar name _Augustus_\r\n(\"Majestic\"). Augustus was no military genius to dazzle the world with his\r\nachievements. He was a cool and passionless statesman who took advantage\r\nof a memorable opportunity to remake the Roman state, and who succeeded in\r\nthe attempt. Absolute power, which destroys weaker men, with Augustus\r\nbrought out the nobler elements of character. From the successful leader\r\nof a party he became the wise and impartial ruler of an empire.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nAugustus had almost unlimited power. His position was that of a king, as\r\nsupreme as Julius Caesar had ever been. Better, however, than Julius\r\nCaesar, Augustus realized that an undisguised autocracy would only\r\nalienate public opinion and invite fresh plots and rebellions, Augustus\r\nintended to be the real master, but he would also be careful to conceal\r\nhis authority under republican forms. The emperor was neither king,\r\ndictator, nor triumvir. He called himself a republican magistrate--\r\n_Princeps_ [2]--the \"First Citizen\" of the state.\r\n\r\nPOWERS ENJOYED BY AUGUSTUS\r\n\r\nAugustus gave up the externals, only to keep the essentials, of royalty.\r\nHe held the proconsular authority, which extended over the frontier\r\nprovinces and their legions. He held the tribunician authority, which made\r\nhis person sacred. As perpetual tribune he could preside over the popular\r\nassemblies, manage the Senate and change its membership at pleasure, and\r\nveto the acts of almost any magistrate. In the provinces and at home in\r\nthe capital city the emperor was supreme.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPIRE UNDER AUGUSTUS\r\n\r\nAugustus ruled a vast realm. In it all the dreams of world dominion which\r\nAlexander had cherished were more than realized. The empire included\r\nnearly the entire circle of the Mediterranean lands. On the west and south\r\nit found natural barriers in the Atlantic Ocean and the African desert. On\r\nthe east the Euphrates River had formed, since the defeat of Crassus, [3]\r\nthe dividing line between Rome and Parthia. The northern frontier, beyond\r\nwhich lay the Germanic barbarians, required, however, additional conquests\r\nfor its protection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, THE EXPANSION OF ROMAN DOMINIONS 31 B.C.-180 A.D.]\r\n\r\nTHE DANUBE BOUNDARY\r\n\r\nThe Danube River made an admirable boundary for much of the Roman\r\nterritory between the Black Sea and the Rhine. Augustus annexed the\r\ndistrict south of the lower course of this river and formed it into the\r\nprovince of Moesia (modern Serbia and Bulgaria). The line of the upper\r\nDanube was later secured by the creation of three new provinces on the\r\nnorthern slopes of the Alps. [4] Henceforth the Balkan peninsula and Italy\r\non the northeast, where the Alpine passes are low and comparatively easy,\r\nwere shielded from attack.\r\n\r\nTHE RHINE BOUNDARY\r\n\r\nAfter the conquests of Julius Caesar in Gaul the Rhine had become the\r\nfrontier between that country and Germany. Augustus repeatedly sent the\r\nlegions into western Germany on punitive expeditions to strike terror into\r\nits warlike tribes and to inspire respect for Roman power. It is doubtful,\r\nhowever, whether he ever intended to conquer Germany and to convert it\r\ninto another province. His failure to do so meant that the Germans were\r\nnot to be Romanized as were their neighbors, the Celts of Gaul. The Rhine\r\ncontinued to be the dividing-line between Roman civilization and Germanic\r\nbarbarism.\r\n\r\nTHE AUGUSTAN AGE\r\n\r\nThe clash of arms on the distant frontiers scarcely disturbed the serenity\r\nof the Roman world. Within the boundaries of the empire the Augustan Age\r\nwas an age of peace and prosperity. The emperor, with unwearied devotion,\r\nturned to the task of ruling wisely and well his vast dominions. He\r\nfollowed the example of Julius Caesar in his insistence on just government\r\nof the provincials. [5] In Italy he put down brigandage, repaired the\r\npublic highways, and planted many colonies in unsettled districts. In Rome\r\nhe established a regular police service, organized the supply of grain and\r\nwater, and continued, on a larger scale than ever, the public games. So\r\nmany were his buildings in the capital city that he could boast he had\r\n\"found Rome of brick and left it of marble.\" [6] Augustus was also very\r\nsuccessful as a religious reformer. He restored numerous temples that had\r\nfallen into decay, revived the ancient sacrifices, and celebrated with\r\npomp and majesty the festivals that had been neglected. These reforms gave\r\nnew vigor to the Roman state religion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONUMENTUM ANCYRANUM\r\nAn inscription on the walls of a ruined temple at Ancyra (modern Angora)\r\nin Asia Minor. It is a copy of the record descriptive of the reign of\r\nAugustus which that emperor in his will decreed to be inscribed on bronze\r\ntablets and placed before his mausoleum at Rome.]\r\n\r\nDEIFICATION OF AUGUSTUS\r\n\r\nEven during the lifetime of Augustus worship had been offered to him by\r\nthe provincials. After his death the Senate gave him divine honors and\r\nenrolled his name among the gods. Temples rose in every province to the\r\ndeified Augustus, and altars smoked with sacrifices to him. Emperor\r\nworship spread rapidly over the ancient world and helped to unite all\r\nclasses in allegiance to the new government. It provided a universal\r\nreligion for a universal empire. Yet just at the time when this new cult\r\nwas taking root, and in the midst of the happy reign of Augustus, there\r\nwas born in Bethlehem of Judea the Christ whose religion was to overcome\r\nthe worship of the emperors and with it all other faiths of pagan\r\nantiquity. [7]\r\n\r\n\r\n67. THE SUCCESSORS OF AUGUSTUS, 14-96 A.D.\r\n\r\nJULIAN AND CLAUDIAN CAESARS, 14-68 A.D.\r\n\r\nFor more than half a century following the death of Augustus his place was\r\nfilled by emperors who, either by descent or adoption, claimed kinship\r\nwith himself and the mighty Julius. They are known as the Julian and\r\nClaudian Caesars. [8] Though none of these four princes had the political\r\nability of Augustus, two of them (Tiberius and Claudius) were excellent\r\nrulers, who ably maintained the standards set by that great emperor. The\r\nother two (Caligula and Nero) were vicious tyrants, the recital of whose\r\nfollies and crimes occupies much space in the works of ancient historians.\r\nTheir doings and misdoings fortunately exerted little influence outside\r\nthe circle of the imperial court and the capital city. Rome itself might\r\nbe disturbed by conspiracy and bloodshed, but Italy and the provinces kept\r\ntheir prosperity.\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF BRITAIN BEGUN, 43 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Claudius was marked by the beginning of the extension of the\r\nempire over Britain. For nearly a hundred years after Caesar's expeditions\r\nno further attempt had been made to annex that island. But its nearness to\r\nGaul, already thoroughly Romanized, brought the country within the sphere\r\nof Roman influence. The thorough conquest of Britain proved to be no easy\r\ntask. It was not until the close of the first century that the island, as\r\nfar north as the Scottish Highlands, was brought under Roman sway. The\r\nprovince of Britannia remained a part of the empire for more than three\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\nBURNING OF ROME, 64 A.D.\r\n\r\nDuring Nero's reign half of Rome was laid in ashes by a great fire, which\r\nraged for a week. But a new Rome speedily arose. It was a much finer city\r\nthan the old, with wide, straight streets instead of narrow alleys, and\r\nwith houses of good stone in place of wooden hovels. Except for the loss\r\nof the temples and public buildings, the fire was a blessing in disguise.\r\n\r\nFLAVIAN CAESARS, 69-96 A.D.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Nero the dynasty that traced its descent from Julius\r\nand Augustus became extinct. There was no one who could legally claim the\r\nvacant throne. The Senate, which in theory had the appointment of a\r\nsuccessor, was too weak to exercise its powers. The imperial guard and the\r\nlegions on the frontiers placed their own candidates in the field. The\r\nRoman world fell into anarchy, and Italy became once more the seat of\r\ncivil war. The throne was finally seized by the able general, Flavius\r\nVespasianus, supported by the armies of the East. He and his two sons,\r\nTitus and Domitian, are called the Flavian Caesars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POMPEII]\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF JERUSALEM, 70 A.D.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Vespasian a revolt of the Jews was crushed, and\r\nJerusalem was captured by Titus, Vespasian's son. It is said, doubtless\r\nwith exaggeration, that one million Jews perished in the siege, the most\r\nawful that history records. The Holy City, together with the Temple, was\r\ndestroyed, and a Roman camp was pitched upon the spot. We may still see in\r\nRome the splendid arch that commemorates this tragic event. [9]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF JERUSALEM AND ITS ENVIRONS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RELIEF ON THE ARCH OF TITUS\r\nThe relief shows Roman soldiers bearing the spoils of the Temple at\r\nJerusalem. Among these are two trumpets, the table of the shewbread, and\r\nthe seven-branched golden candlestick.]\r\n\r\nERUPTION OF VESUVIUS, 79 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Titus is chiefly memorable for the destruction of Pompeii and\r\nHerculaneum, two cites on the bay of Naples. After long inactivity the\r\nvolcano of Vesuvius suddenly belched forth torrents of liquid lava and\r\nmud, followed by a rain of ashes. Pompeii was covered to a depth of about\r\nfifteen feet by the falling cinders. Herculaneum was overwhelmed in a sea\r\nof sulphurous mud and lava to a depth of eighty feet in many places. The\r\ncities were completely entombed, and in time even their location was\r\nforgotten. Modern excavations have disclosed a large part of Pompeii, with\r\nits streets, shops, baths, temples, and theaters. The visitor there gains\r\na vivid impression of Roman life during the first century of our era. [10]\r\n\r\n\r\n68. THE \"GOOD EMPERORS,\" 96-180 A.D.\r\n\r\nTHE ANTONINE CAESARS\r\n\r\nThe five rulers--Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus\r\nAurelius--whose reigns cover the greater part of the second century, are\r\nsometimes called the Antonine Caesars, because two of them bore the name\r\nAntoninus. They are better known as the \"Good Emperors,\" a title which\r\nwell describes them. Under their just and beneficent government the empire\r\nreached its greatest prosperity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NERVA (Vatican Museum, Rome)\r\nA remarkably fine example of Roman portrait statuary.]\r\n\r\nTRAJAN THE CONQUEROR\r\n\r\nThe emperor Trajan rivaled Julius Caesar in military ability and enlarged\r\nthe Roman world to the widest limits it was ever to attain. His first\r\nconquests were in Europe and resulted in the annexation of Dacia, an\r\nextensive territory north of the Danube. Thousands of colonists settled in\r\nDacia and spread everywhere the language and arts of Rome. Its modern name\r\n(Rumania) bears witness to Rome's abiding influence there. Trajan's\r\ncampaigns in Asia had less importance, though in appearance they were more\r\nsplendid. He drove the Parthians from Armenia and conquered the Tigris-\r\nEuphrates valley. To hold in subjection such distant regions only\r\nincreased the difficulty of guarding the frontiers. Trajan's successor,\r\nHadrian, at once abandoned them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLUMN OF TRAJAN\r\nA bronze statue of Trajan formerly occupying the top of the monument has\r\nbeen replaced by a figure of St Peter. The column is decorated with a\r\ncontinuous spiral relief representing scenes from the Dacian War. About\r\ntwenty five hundred separate designs are included in this remarkable\r\ncollection.]\r\n\r\nHADRIAN THE ADMINISTRATOR\r\n\r\nHadrian distinguished himself as an administrator. He may be compared with\r\nAugustus in his love of peace and in his care for the interests of the\r\nprovincials. Hadrian made two long journeys throughout the Roman world. On\r\nthe frontiers he built fortresses and walls, in the provinces he raised\r\nbaths, aqueducts, theaters, and temples. Scarcely a city throughout the\r\nempire lacked some monument to his generosity. Hadrian left behind him the\r\nmemory of a prince whose life was devoted to the public welfare--the first\r\nservant of the state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WALL OF HADRIAN IN BRITAIN\r\nThe wall extended between the Tyne and the Solway a distance of seventy\r\nmiles. It was built of concrete faced with square blocks. The height is\r\nnearly twenty feet, the thickness about eight feet. Along the wall were\r\nnumerous towers and gates and a little to the north of it stretched an\r\nearthen rampart protected by a deep ditch. A broad road, lined with\r\nseventeen military camps, ran between the two fortifications.]\r\n\r\nMARCUS AURELIUS, THE PHILOSOPHER ON THE THRONE\r\n\r\nThe last of the \"Good Emperors,\" Marcus Aurelius, was a thinker and a\r\nstudent, but he enjoyed little opportunity for meditation. His reign was\r\nfilled with an almost uninterrupted series of campaigns against the\r\nParthians on the Euphrates and the Germans on the Danube and the Rhine.\r\nThese wars revealed the weakness of the frontiers and rapidly growing\r\nstrength of the barbarians. After the death of Marcus Aurelius the empire\r\nentered on its downward course. But before passing to this period of our\r\nstudy, we may take a survey of the world under Roman rule, during the two\r\ncenturies between Augustus and Marcus Aurelius.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARCUS AURELIUS IN HIS TRIUMPHAL CAR (Palace of the\r\nConservatori, Rome)\r\n\r\nA panel from an arch erected by the emperor.]\r\n\r\n\r\n69. THE PROVINCES OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\nTHE STANDING ARMY\r\n\r\nThe Roman Empire, at its widest extent in the second century, included\r\nforty-three provinces. They were protected against Germans, Parthians and\r\nother foes by twenty-five legions, numbering with the auxiliary forces,\r\nabout three hundred thousand men. This standing army was one of Rome's\r\nmost important agencies for the spread of her civilization over barbarian\r\nlands. Its membership was drawn largely from the border provinces, often\r\nfrom the very countries where the soldiers' camps were fixed. Though the\r\narmy became less and less Roman in blood, it always kept in character and\r\nspirit the best traditions of Rome. The long intervals of peace were not\r\npassed by the soldiers in idleness. They built the great highways that\r\npenetrated every region of the empire, spanned the streams with bridges,\r\nraised dikes and aqueducts, and taught the border races the arts of\r\ncivilization. It was due, finally, to the labors of the legionaries, that\r\nthe most exposed parts of the frontiers were provided with an extensive\r\nsystem of walls and ramparts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PANTHEON\r\nThe original building was the work of Agrippa, a minister of Augustus. The\r\ntemple was reconstructed by Hadrian who left the Greek portico unchanged\r\nbut added the rotunda and the dome. This great dome, the largest in the\r\nworld, is made of solid concrete. During the Middle Ages, the Pantheon was\r\nconverted into a church. It is now the burial place of the kings of\r\nItaly.]\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN ROADS\r\n\r\nThe Roman system of roads received its great extension during the imperial\r\nage. The principal trunk lines began at the gates of Rome and radiated\r\nthence to every province. Along these highways sped the couriers of the\r\nCaesars, carrying dispatches and making, by means of relays of horses, as\r\nmuch as one hundred and fifty miles a day. The roads resounded to the\r\ntramp of the legionaries passing to their stations on the distant\r\nfrontier. Travelers by foot, horseback, or litter journeyed on them from\r\nland to land, employing maps which described routes and distances. Traders\r\nused them for the transport of merchandise. Roman roads, in short, were\r\nthe railways of antiquity. [11]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOMB OF HADRIAN\r\nThe building was formerly topped by another of smaller size which bore a\r\nstatue of the emperor. In medieval times this stately tomb was converted\r\ninto a castle. It is now used as a museum. The bridge across the Tiber was\r\nbuilt by Hadrian.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, ROMAN BRITAIN SHOWING CHIEF ROMAN ROADS]\r\n\r\nTHE PAX ROMANA\r\n\r\nIn her roads and fortifications, in the living rampart of her legions,\r\nRome long found security. Except for the districts conquered by Trajan but\r\nabandoned by Hadrian, [12] the empire during this period did not lose a\r\nprovince. For more than two hundred years, throughout an area as large as\r\nthe United States, the civilized world rested under what an ancient writer\r\ncalls \"the immense majesty of the Roman peace.\" [13]\r\n\r\nEXTENSION OF ROMAN CITIZENSHIP\r\n\r\nThe grant of Roman citizenship to all Italians after the Social War [14]\r\nonly increased for a time the contrast between Italy and the provinces.\r\nBut even before the fall of the republic Caesar's legislation had begun\r\nthe work of uniting the Roman and the provincial. [15] More and more the\r\nemperors followed in his footsteps. The extension of Roman citizenship was\r\na gradual process covering two centuries. It was left for the emperor\r\nCaracalla, early in the third century, to take the final step. In 212 A.D.\r\nhe issued an edict which bestowed citizenship on all freeborn inhabitants\r\nof the empire. This famous edict completed the work, begun so many\r\ncenturies before, of Romanizing the ancient world.\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGES OF ROMAN CITIZENS\r\n\r\nThe grant of citizenship, though it increased the burden of taxation,\r\nbrought no slight advantage to those who possessed it. A Roman citizen\r\ncould not be maltreated with impunity or punished without a legal trial\r\nbefore Roman courts. If accused in a capital case, he could always protect\r\nhimself against an unjust decision by an \"appeal to Caesar\", that is, to\r\nthe emperor at Rome. St. Paul did this on one occasion when on trial for\r\nhis life. [16] Wherever he lived, a Roman citizen enjoyed, both for his\r\nperson and his property, the protection of Roman law.\r\n\r\n\r\n70. THE ROMAN LAW AND THE LATIN LANGUAGE\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENT OF ROMAN LAW\r\n\r\nThe Romans were the most legal-minded people of antiquity. It was their\r\nmission to give laws to the world. Almost at the beginning of the republic\r\nthey framed the code of the Twelve Tables, [17] which long remained the\r\nbasis of their jurisprudence. This code, however, was so harsh, technical,\r\nand brief that it could not meet the needs of a progressive state. The\r\nRomans gradually improved their legal system, especially after they began\r\nto rule over conquered nations. The disputes which arose between citizens\r\nand subjects were decided by the praetors or provincial governors in\r\naccordance with what seemed to them to be principles of justice and\r\nequity. These principles gradually found a place in Roman law, together\r\nwith many rules and observances of foreign peoples. Roman law in this way\r\ntended to take over and absorb all that was best in ancient jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF ROMAN LAW\r\n\r\nThus, as the extension of the citizenship carried the principles and\r\npractice of Roman law to every quarter of the empire, the spirit of that\r\nlaw underwent an entire change. It became exact, impartial, liberal,\r\nhumane. It limited the use of torture to force confession from persons\r\naccused of crime. It protected the child against a father's tyranny. It\r\nprovided that a master who killed a slave should be punished as a\r\nmurderer, and even taught that all men are originally free by the law of\r\nnature and therefore that slavery is contrary to natural right. Justice it\r\ndefined as \"the steady and abiding purpose to give every man that which is\r\nhis own.\" [18] Roman law, which began as the rude code of a primitive\r\npeople, ended as the most refined and admirable system of jurisprudence\r\never framed by man. This law, as we shall see later, has passed from\r\nancient Rome to modern Europe. [19]\r\n\r\nLATIN IN ITALY\r\n\r\nThe conquest by Latin of the languages of the world is almost as\r\ninteresting and important a story as the conquest by Rome of the nations\r\nof the world. At the beginning of Latin in Roman history Latin was the\r\nspeech of only the Italy people of Latium. Beyond the limits of Latium\r\nLatin came into contact with the many different languages spoken in early\r\nItaly. Some of them, such as Greek and Etruscan, soon disappeared from\r\nItaly after Roman expansion, but those used by native Italian peoples\r\nshowed more power of resistance. It was not until the last century B.C.\r\nthat Latin was thoroughly established in the central and southern parts of\r\nthe peninsula. After the Social War the Italian peoples became citizens of\r\nRome, and with Roman citizenship went the use of the Latin tongue.\r\n\r\nLATIN IN THE WESTERN PROVINCES\r\n\r\nThe Romans carried their language to the barbarian peoples of the West, as\r\nthey had carried it to Italy. Their missionaries were colonists,\r\nmerchants, soldiers, and public officials. The Latin spoken by them was\r\neagerly taken up by the rude, unlettered natives, who tried to make\r\nthemselves as Roman as possible in dress, customs, and speech. This\r\nprovincial Latin was not simply the language of the upper classes; the\r\ncommon people themselves used it freely, as we know from thousands of\r\ninscriptions found in western and central Europe. In the countries which\r\nnow make up Spain, France, Switzerland, southern Austria, England, and\r\nNorth Africa, the old national tongues were abandoned for the Latin of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nROMANCE LANGUAGES\r\n\r\nThe decline of the Roman Empire did not bring about the downfall of the\r\nLatin language in the West. It became the basis of the so-called Romance\r\nlanguages--French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Rumanian--which arose\r\nin the Middle Ages out of the spoken Latin of the common people. Even our\r\nEnglish language, which comes to us from the speech of the Germanic\r\ninvaders of Britain, contains so many words of Latin origin that we can\r\nscarcely utter a sentence without using some of them. The rule of Rome has\r\npassed away; the language of Rome still remains to enrich the intellectual\r\nlife of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n71. THE MUNICIPALITIES OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\nPREVALENCE OF CITY LIFE\r\n\r\nThe world under Roman rule was a world of cities. Some had earlier been\r\nnative settlements, such as those in Gaul before the Roman conquest.\r\nOthers were the splendid Hellenistic cities in the East. [20] Many more\r\nwere of Roman origin, arising from the colonies and fortified camps in\r\nwhich citizens and soldiers had settled. [21] Where Rome did not find\r\ncities, she created them.\r\n\r\nSOME IMPORTANT CITIES\r\n\r\nNot only were the cities numerous, but many of them, even when judged by\r\nmodern standards, reached great size. Rome was the largest, her population\r\nbeing estimated at from one to two millions. Alexandria came next with\r\nmore than half a million people. Syracuse was the third metropolis of the\r\nempire. Italy contained such important towns as Verona, Milan, and\r\nRavenna. In Gaul were Marseilles, Nîmes, Bordeaux, Lyons--all cities with\r\na continuous existence to the present day. In Britain York and London were\r\nseats of commerce, Chester and Lincoln were military colonies, and Bath\r\nwas celebrated then, as now, for its medicinal waters. Carthage and\r\nCorinth had risen in new splendor from their ashes. Athens was still the\r\nhome of Greek art and Greek culture. Asia included such ancient and\r\nimportant centers as Pergamum, Smyrna, Ephesus, Rhodes, and Antioch. The\r\nstudent who reads in his New Testament the _Acts of the Apostles_ will get\r\na vivid impression of some of these great capitals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROMAN BATHS, AT BATH, ENGLAND\r\nBath, the ancient Aquae Sulis, was famous in Roman times for its hot\r\nsprings. Here are very interesting remains, including a large pool,\r\neighty-three by forty feet in size, and lined at the bottom with the\r\nRoman lead, besides smaller bathing chambers and portions of the ancient\r\npipes and conduits. The building and statues are modern restorations.]\r\n\r\nAPPEARANCE OF THE CITIES\r\n\r\nEvery municipality was a Rome in miniature. It had its forum and senate-\r\nhouse, its temples, theaters, and baths, its circus for racing, and its\r\namphitheater for gladiatorial combats. Most of the municipalities enjoyed\r\nan abundant supply of water, and some had good sewer systems. The larger\r\ntowns had well-paved, though narrow, streets. Pompeii, a small place of\r\nscarcely thirty thousand inhabitants, still exists to give us an idea of\r\nthe appearance of one of these ancient cities. And what we find at Pompeii\r\nwas repeated on a more splendid scale in hundreds of places from the\r\nDanube to the Nile, from Britain to Arabia.\r\n\r\nCITY GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThe municipalities of Roman origin copied the government of Rome itself.\r\n[22] Each city had a council, or senate, and a popular assembly which\r\nchose the magistrates. These officials were generally rich men; they\r\nreceived no salary, and in fact had to pay a large sum on entering office.\r\nLocal politics excited the keenest interest. Many of the inscriptions\r\nfound on the walls of Pompeii are election placards recommending\r\nparticular candidates for office. Women sometimes took part in political\r\ncontests. Distributions of grain, oil, and money were made to needy\r\ncitizens, in imitation of the bad Roman practice. There were public\r\nbanquets, imposing festivals, wild-beast hunts, and bloody contests of\r\ngladiators, like those at Rome.\r\n\r\nSURVIVAL OF THE ROMAN MUNICIPAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThe busy, throbbing life in these countless centers of the Roman world has\r\nlong since been stilled. The cities themselves, in many instances, have\r\nutterly disappeared. Yet the forms of municipal government, together with\r\nthe Roman idea of a free, self-governing city, never wholly died out. Some\r\nof the most important cities which flourished in southern and western\r\nEurope during the later Middle Ages preserved clear traces of their\r\nancient Roman origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n72. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS IN THE FIRST AND SECOND CENTURIES\r\n\r\nPROMOTION OF COMMERCE\r\n\r\nThe first two centuries of our era formed the golden age of Roman\r\ncommerce. The emperors fostered it in many ways. Augustus and his\r\nsuccessors kept the Mediterranean free from pirates, built lighthouses and\r\nimproved harbors, policed the highways, and made travel by land both\r\nspeedy and safe. An imperial currency [23] replaced the various national\r\ncoinages with their limited circulation. The vexatious import and export\r\nduties, levied by different countries and cities on foreign produce, were\r\nswept away. Free trade flourished between the cities and provinces of the\r\nRoman world.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL TRADE ROUTES\r\n\r\nRoman commerce followed, in general, the routes which Phoenicians had\r\ndiscovered centuries before. After the annexation of Gaul the rivers of\r\nthat country became channels of trade between western Europe and Italy.\r\nThe conquest of the districts north and south of the Danube opened up an\r\nimportant route between central Europe and the Mediterranean. Imports from\r\nthe far eastern countries came by caravan through Asia to ports on the\r\nBlack Sea. The water routes led by way of the Persian Gulf to the great\r\nSyrian cities of Antioch and Palmyra and, by way of the Red Sea, to\r\nAlexandria on the Nile. From these thriving commercial centers products\r\nwere shipped to every region of the empire. [24]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ROMAN FREIGHT SHIP\r\nThe ship lies beside the wharf at Ostia. In the after-part of the vessel\r\nis a cabin with two windows. Notice the figure of Victory on the top of\r\nthe single mast and the decoration of the mainsail with the wolf and\r\ntwins. The ship is steered by a pair of huge paddles.]\r\n\r\nLOCAL TRADING AT ROME\r\n\r\nThe importation and disposal of foreign goods at Rome furnished employment\r\nfor many thousands of traders. There were great wholesale merchants whose\r\nwarehouses stored grain and all kinds of merchandise. There were also many\r\nretail shopkeepers. They might be sometimes the slaves or freedmen of a\r\nwealthy noble who preferred to keep in the background. Sometimes they were\r\nmen of free birth. The feeling that petty trade was unworthy of a citizen,\r\nthough strong in republican days, tended to disappear under the empire.\r\n\r\nFREE LABORERS AT ROME\r\n\r\nThe slaves at Rome, like those at Athens, [25] carried on many industrial\r\ntasks. We must not imagine, however, that all the manual labor of the city\r\nwas performed by bondmen. The number of slaves even tended to decline,\r\nwhen there were no more border wars to yield captives for the slave\r\nmarkets. The growing custom of emancipation worked in the same direction.\r\nWe find in this period a large body of free laborers, not only in the\r\ncapital city, but in all parts of the empire.\r\n\r\nTHE GUILDS\r\n\r\nThe workmen engaged in a particular calling frequently formed clubs, or\r\nguilds. [26] There were guilds of weavers, shoe-makers, jewelers,\r\npainters, musicians, and even of gladiators. These associations were not\r\norganized for the purpose of securing higher wages and shorter hours by\r\nstrikes or threat of strikes. They seem to have existed chiefly for social\r\nand religious purposes. Each guild had its clubhouse for official meetings\r\nand banquets. Each guild had its special deity, such as Vesta, the fire\r\ngoddess, for bakers, and Bacchus, the wine god, for innkeepers. Every year\r\nthe guildsmen held a festival, in honor of their patron, and marched\r\nthrough the streets with banners and the emblems of their trade. Nearly\r\nall the guilds had as one main object the provision of a proper funeral\r\nand tomb for deceased members. The humble laborer found some consolation\r\nin the thought that he belonged to a club of friends and fellow workers,\r\nwho after death would give him decent burial and keep his memory green.\r\n\r\nLIFE OF THE WORKING CLASSES\r\n\r\nFree workingmen throughout the Roman world appear to have led reasonably\r\nhappy lives. They were not driven or enslaved by their employers or forced\r\nto labor for long hours in grimy, unwholesome factories. Slums existed,\r\nbut no sweatshops. If wages were low, so also was the cost of living.\r\nWine, oil, and wheat flour were cheap. The mild climate made heavy\r\nclothing unnecessary and permitted an outdoor life. The public baths--\r\ngreat clubhouses--stood open to every one who could pay a trifling fee.\r\n[27] Numerous holidays, celebrated with games and shows, brightened\r\nexistence. On the whole we may conclude that working people at Rome and in\r\nthe provinces enjoyed greater comfort during this period than had ever\r\nbeen their lot in previous ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ROMAN VILLA\r\nWall painting, Pompeii.]\r\n\r\nGREAT FORTUNES\r\n\r\nIt was an age of millionaires. There had been rich men, such as Crassus,\r\n[28] during the last century of the republic; their numbers increased and\r\ntheir fortunes rose during the first century of the empire. The\r\nphilosopher Seneca, a tutor of Nero, is said to have made twelve million\r\ndollars within four years by the emperor's favor. Narcissus, the secretary\r\nof Claudius, made sixteen million dollars--the largest Roman fortune on\r\nrecord. This sum must be multiplied four or five times to find its modern\r\nequivalent, since in antiquity interest rates were higher and the\r\npurchasing power of money was greater than to-day. Such private fortunes\r\nare surpassed only by those of the present age.\r\n\r\nLUXURY AND EXTRAVAGANCE\r\n\r\nThe heaping-up of riches in the hands of a few brought its natural\r\nconsequence in luxury and extravagance. The palaces of the wealthy, with\r\ntheir gardens, baths, picture galleries, and other features, were costly\r\nto build and costly to keep up. The money not lavished by a noble on his\r\ntown house could be easily sunk on his villas in the country. All Italy,\r\nfrom the bay of Naples, to the foot of the Alps, was dotted with elegant\r\nresidences, having flower gardens, game preserves, fishponds, and\r\nartificial lakes. Much senseless waste occurred at banquets and\r\nentertainments. Vast sums were spent on vessels of gold and silver,\r\njewelry, clothing, and house furnishings. Even funerals and tombs required\r\nheavy outlays. A capitalist of imperial Rome could get rid of a fortune in\r\nselfish indulgences almost as readily as any modern millionaire not\r\nblessed with a refined taste or with public spirit.\r\n\r\nSOME SOCIAL EVILS\r\n\r\nSome of the customs of the time appear especially shocking. The brutal\r\ngladiatorial games [29] were a passion with every one, from the emperor to\r\nhis lowest subject. Infanticide was a general practice. Marriage grew to\r\nbe a mere civil contract, easily made and easily broken. Common as divorce\r\nhad become, the married state was regarded as undesirable. Augustus vainly\r\nmade laws to encourage matrimony and discourage celibacy. Suicide,\r\nespecially among the upper classes, was astonishingly frequent. No one\r\nquestioned another's right to leave this life at pleasure. The decline of\r\nthe earlier paganism left many men without a deep religious faith to\r\ncombat the growing doubt and worldliness of the age.\r\n\r\nBRIGHTER ASPECTS OF ROMAN SOCIETY\r\n\r\nYet this dark picture needs correction at many points. It may be\r\nquestioned whether the vice, luxury, and wickedness of ancient Rome,\r\nAntioch, or Alexandria much exceeded what our great modern capitals can\r\nshow, During this period, moreover, many remarkable improvements took\r\nplace in social life and manners. There was an increasing kindliness and\r\ncharity. The weak and the infirm were better treated. The education of the\r\npoor was encouraged by the founding of free schools. Wealthy citizens of\r\nthe various towns lavished their fortunes on such public works as baths,\r\naqueducts, and temples, for the benefit of all classes. Even the slaves\r\nwere much better treated. Imperial laws aimed to check the abuses of\r\ncruelty, overwork, and neglect, and philosophers recommended to masters\r\nthe exercise of gentleness and mercy toward slaves. In fact, the first and\r\nsecond centuries of our era were marked by a great growth of the\r\nhumanitarian spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n73. THE GRAECO-ROMAN WORLD\r\n\r\nTHE NEW COSMOPOLITANISM\r\n\r\nJust as the conquests of Alexander, by uniting the Orient to Greece,\r\nproduced a Graeco-Oriental civilization, so now the expansion of Rome over\r\nthe Mediterranean formed another world-wide culture, in which both Greek\r\nand Roman elements met and mingled. A new sense of cosmopolitanism arose\r\nin place of the old civic or national patriotism. Roman elements met and\r\nmingled. A new sense of cosmopolitanism arose in place of the old civic or\r\nnational patriotism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ROMAN TEMPLE\r\nThe best preserved of Roman temples. Located at Nîmes in southern France,\r\nwhere it is known as La Maison Carrée (\"the square house\"). The structure\r\nis now used as a museum of antiquities.]\r\n\r\nUNIFYING AND CIVILIZING FORCES\r\n This cosmopolitan feeling was the outcome of those unifying and\r\ncivilizing forces which the imperial system set at work. The extension of\r\nRoman citizenship broke down the old distinction between the citizens and\r\nthe subjects of Rome. The development of Roman law carried its principles\r\nof justice and equity to the remotest regions. The spread of the Latin\r\nlanguage provided the western half of the empire with a speech as\r\nuniversal there as Greek was in the East. Trade and travel united the\r\nprovinces with one another and with Rome. The worship of the Caesars\r\ndimmed the luster of all local worships and kept constantly before men's\r\nminds the idea of Rome and of her mighty emperors. Last, but not least\r\nimportant, was the fusion of alien peoples through intermarriage with\r\nRoman soldiers and colonists. \"How many settlements,\" exclaims the\r\nphilosopher Seneca, \"have been planted in every province! Wherever the\r\nRoman conquers, there he dwells.\" [30]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AMPHITHEATER AT ARLES\r\nThe amphitheater at Arles in southern France was used during the Middle\r\nAges as a fortress then as a prison and finally became the resort of\r\ncriminals and paupers. The illustration shows it before the removal of the\r\nbuildings about 1830 A.D. Bullfights still continue in the arena, where,\r\nin Roman times, animal baitings and gladiatorial games took place.]\r\n\r\nMONUMENTS OF ROMAN RULE\r\n\r\nThe best evidence of Rome's imperial rule is found in the monuments she\r\nraised in every quarter of the ancient world. Some of the grandest ruins\r\nof antiquity are not in the capital city itself, or even in Italy, but in\r\nSpain, France, England, Greece, Switzerland, Asia Minor, Syria, and North\r\nAfrica. Among these are Hadrian's Wall in Britain, the splendid aqueduct\r\nknown as the Pont du Gard near Nîmes in southern France, the beautiful\r\ntemple called La Maison Carrée in the same city, the Olympieum at Athens,\r\nand the temple of the Sun at Baalbec in Syria Thus the lonely hilltops,\r\nthe desolate desert sands, the mountain fastnesses of three continents\r\nbear witness even now to the widespreading sway of Rome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MEGALITH AT BAALBEC\r\nA block of stone 68 feet long 10 feet high and weighing about 1500 tons.\r\nIt is still attached to its bed in the quarry not far from the ruins of\r\nBaalbec in Syria. The temples of Baalbec seen in the distance were built\r\nby the Romans in the third century A.D. The majestic temple of the Sun\r\ncontains three megaliths almost as huge as the one represented in the\r\nillustration. They are the largest blocks known to have been used in any\r\nstructure. For a long time they were supposed to be relics of giant\r\nbuilders.]\r\n\r\nROMANIZATION OF EAST AND WEST\r\n\r\nThe civilized world took on the stamp and impress of Rome. The East,\r\nindeed, remained Greek in language and feeling, but even there Roman law\r\nand government prevailed, Roman roads traced their unerring course, and\r\nRoman architects erected majestic monuments. The West became completely\r\nRoman. North Africa, Spain, Gaul, distant Dacia, and Britain were the\r\nseats of populous cities, where the Latin language was spoken and Roman\r\ncustoms were followed. From them came the emperors. They furnished some of\r\nthe most eminent men of letters. Their schools of grammar and rhetoric\r\nattracted students from Rome itself. Thus unconsciously, but none the less\r\nsurely, local habits and manners, national religions and tongues,\r\nprovincial institutions and ways of thinking disappeared from the ancient\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

THE \"SOLDIER EMPERORS,\" 180-284 A.D.\r\n\r\nTHE LATER EMPIRE, 180-395 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe period called the Later Empire covers the two hundred and fifteen\r\nyears from the accession of Commodus to the final division of the Roman\r\nworld at the death of Theodosius. It formed, in general, a period of\r\ndecline. The very existence of the empire was threatened, both from within\r\nand from without. The armies on the frontiers often set up their favorite\r\nleaders as contestants for the throne, thus provoking civil war. Ambitious\r\ngovernors of distant provinces sometimes revolted against a weak or\r\nunpopular emperor and tried to establish independent states. The Germans\r\ntook advantage of the unsettled condition of affairs to make constant\r\ninroads. About the middle of the third century it became necessary to\r\nsurrender to them the great province of Dacia, which Trajan had won. [1] A\r\nserious danger also appeared in the distant East. Here the Persians,\r\nhaving overcome the Parthians, [2] endeavored to recover from Roman hands\r\nthe Asiatic provinces which had once belonged to the old Persian realm.\r\nThough the Persians failed to make any permanent conquest of Roman\r\nterritory, their constant attacks weakened the empire at the very time\r\nwhen the northern barbarians had again become a menace.\r\n\r\n\"IMPERIAL PHANTOMS\"\r\n\r\nThe rulers who occupied the throne during the first half of this troubled\r\nperiod are commonly known as the \"Soldier Emperors,\" because so many of\r\nthem owed their position to the swords of the legionaries. Emperor after\r\nemperor followed in quick succession, to enjoy a brief reign and then to\r\nperish in some sudden insurrection. Within a single year (237-238 A.D.)\r\nsix rulers were chosen, worshiped, and then murdered by their troops \"You\r\nlittle know,\" said one of these imperial phantoms, \"what a poor thing it\r\nis to be an emperor.\" [3]\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL SITUATION IN 284 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe close of the third century thus found the empire engaged in a struggle\r\nfor existence. No part of the Roman world had escaped the ravages of war.\r\nThe fortification of the capital city by the emperor Aurelian was itself a\r\ntestimony to the altered condition of affairs. The situation was\r\ndesperate, yet not hopeless. Under an able ruler, such as Aurelian, Rome\r\nproved to be still strong enough to repel her foes. It was the work of the\r\neven more capable Diocletian to establish the empire on so solid a\r\nfoundation that it endured with almost undiminished strength for another\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WALL OF ROME\r\nConstructed by Aurelian and rebuilt by Honorius. The material is concrete\r\nfaced with brick, thickness 13 feet, greatest height 58 feet. This is\r\nstill the wall of the modern city, although at present no effort is made\r\nto keep it in repair.]\r\n\r\n\r\n75. THE \"ABSOLUTE EMPERORS,\" 284-395 A.D.\r\n\r\nREIGN OF DIOCLETIAN, 284-305 A.D.\r\n\r\nDiocletian, whose reign is one of the most illustrious in Roman history,\r\nentered the army as a common soldier, rose to high command, and fought his\r\nway to the throne. A strong, ambitious man, Diocletian resolutely set\r\nhimself to the task of remaking the Roman government. His success in this\r\nundertaking entitles him to rank, as a statesman and administrator, with\r\nAugustus.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES IN THE IMPERIAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThe reforms of Diocletian were meant to remedy those weaknesses in the\r\nimperial system disclosed by the disasters of the preceding century. In\r\nthe first place, experience showed that the empire was unwieldy. There\r\nwere the distant frontiers on the Rhine, Danube, and Euphrates to be\r\nguarded; there were all the provinces to be governed. A single ruler,\r\nhowever able and energetic, had more than he could do. In the second\r\nplace, the succession to the imperial throne was uncertain. Now an emperor\r\nnamed his successor, now the Senate elected him, and now the swords of the\r\nlegionaries raised him to the purple. Such an unsettled state of affairs\r\nconstantly invited those struggles between rival pretenders which had so\r\nnearly brought the empire to destruction.\r\n\r\nDIOCLETIAN'S REFORMS\r\n\r\nDiocletian began his reforms by adopting a scheme for \"partnership\r\nemperors.\" He shared the Roman world with a trusted lieutenant named\r\nMaximian. Each was to be an Augustus, with all the honors of an emperor.\r\nDiocletian ruled the East; Maximian ruled the West. Further partnership\r\nsoon seemed advisable, and so each _Augustus_ chose a younger associate,\r\nor _Caesar_, to aid him in the government and at his death or abdication\r\nto become his heir. Diocletian also remodeled the provincial system. The\r\nentire empire, including Italy, was divided into more than one hundred\r\nprovinces. They were grouped into thirteen dioceses and these, in turn,\r\ninto four prefectures. [4] This reform much lessened the authority of the\r\nprovincial governor, who now ruled over a small district and had to obey\r\nthe vicar of his diocese.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW ABSOLUTISM\r\n\r\nThe emperors, from Diocletian onward, were autocrats. They bore the proud\r\ntitle of _Dominus_ (\"Lord\"). They were treated as gods. Everything that\r\ntouched their persons was sacred. They wore a diadem of pearls and\r\ngorgeous robes of silk and gold, like those of Asiatic monarchs. They\r\nfilled their palaces with a crowd of fawning, flattering nobles, and\r\nbusied themselves with an endless round of stately and impressive\r\nceremonials. Hitherto a Roman emperor had been an _imperator_, [5] the\r\nhead of an army. Now he became a king, to be greeted, not with the old\r\nmilitary salute, but with the bent knee and the prostrate form of\r\nadoration. Such pomps and vanities, which former Romans would have thought\r\ndegrading, helped to inspire reverence among the servile subjects of a\r\nlater age. If it was the aim of Augustus to disguise, it was the aim of\r\nDiocletian to display, the unbounded power of a Roman emperor.\r\n\r\nCONSTANTINE, SOLE EMPEROR, 324-337 A.D.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that Diocletian's reforms helped to prolong the\r\nexistence of the empire. In one respect, however, they must be pronounced\r\na failure. They did not end the disputes about the succession. Only two\r\nyears after the abdication of Diocletian there were six rival pretenders\r\nfor the title of _Augustus_. Their dreary struggles continued, until at\r\nlength two emperors were left--Constantine in the West, Licinius in the\r\nEast. After a few years of joint rule another civil war made Constantine\r\nsupreme. The Roman world again had a single master.\r\n\r\nREIGN OF CONSTANTINE\r\n\r\nConstantine was an able general and a wise statesman. Two events of\r\nlasting importance have made his reign memorable. It was Constantine who\r\nrecognized Christianity as one of the religions of the empire and thus\r\npaved the way for the triumph of that faith over the ancient paganism. His\r\nwork in this connection will be discussed presently. It was Constantine,\r\nalso, who established a new capital for the Roman world at Byzantium [6]\r\non the Bosporus. He christened it \"New Rome,\" but it soon took the\r\nemperor's name as Constantinople, the \"City of Constantine.\" [7]\r\n\r\nFOUNDATION OF CONSTANTINOPLE\r\n\r\nSeveral good reasons could be urged for the removal of the world's\r\nmetropolis from the Tiber to the Bosporus. The Roman Empire was ceasing to\r\nbe one empire. Constantine wanted a great city for the eastern half to\r\nbalance Rome in the western half. Again, Constantinople, far more than\r\nRome, was the military center of the empire. Rome lay too far from the\r\nvulnerable frontiers; Constantinople occupied a position about equidistant\r\nfrom the Germans on the lower Danube and the Persians on the Euphrates.\r\nFinally, Constantine believed that Christianity, which he wished to become\r\nthe prevailing religion, would encounter less opposition and criticism in\r\nhis new city than at Rome, with its pagan atmosphere and traditions.\r\nConstantinople was to be not simply a new seat of government but also\r\ndistinctively a Christian capital. Such it remained for more than eleven\r\ncenturies. [8]\r\n\r\nAFTER CONSTANTINE, 337-395 A.D.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Constantine the Roman world again entered on a period\r\nof disorder. The inroads of the Germans across the Danube and the Rhine\r\nthreatened the European provinces of the empire with dissolution. The\r\noutlook in the Asiatic provinces, overrun by the Persians, was no less\r\ngloomy. Meanwhile the eastern and western halves of the empire tended more\r\nand more to grow apart. The separation between the two had become well\r\nmarked by the close of the fourth century. After the death of the emperor\r\nTheodosius (395 A.D.) there came to be in fact, if not in name, a Roman\r\nEmpire in the East and a Roman Empire in the West.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL SITUATION IN 395 A.D.\r\n\r\nMore than four hundred years had now elapsed since the battle of Actium\r\nmade Octavian supreme in the Roman world. If we except the abandonment of\r\nTrajan's conquests beyond the Danube and the Euphrates, [9] no part of the\r\nhuge empire had as yet succumbed to its enemies. The subject peoples,\r\nduring these four centuries, had not tried to overthrow the empire or to\r\nwithdraw from its protection. The Roman state, men believed, would endure\r\nforever. Yet the times were drawing nigh when the old order of things was\r\nto be broken up; when barbarian invaders were to seize the fairest\r\nprovinces as their own; and when new kingdoms, ruled by men of Germanic\r\nspeech, were to arise in lands that once obeyed Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n76. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH CENTURIES\r\n\r\nTHE \"FALL\" OF ROME\r\n\r\nRome, it has been said, was not built in a day; the rule of Rome was not\r\ndestroyed in a day. When we speak of the \"fall\" of Rome, we have in mind,\r\nnot a violent catastrophe which suddenly plunged the civilized world into\r\nruin, but rather the slow and gradual decay of ancient society throughout\r\nthe basin of the Mediterranean. This decay set in long before the Germans\r\nand the Persians became a serious danger to the empire. It would have\r\ncontinued, doubtless, had there been no Germans and Persians to break\r\nthrough the frontiers and destroy. The truth seems to be that, during the\r\nthird and fourth centuries of our era, classical civilization, like an\r\novertrained athlete, had grown \"stale.\"\r\n\r\nDEPOPULATION DUE TO THE SLAVE SYSTEM\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to set forth all the forces which century after century\r\nhad been sapping the strength of the state. The most obvious element of\r\nweakness was the want of men to fill the armies and to cultivate the\r\nfields. The slave system seems to have been partly responsible for this\r\ndepopulation. The peasant on his little homestead could not compete with\r\nthe wealthy noble whose vast estates were worked by gangs of slaves. The\r\nartisan could not support himself and his family on the pittance that kept\r\nhis slave competitor alive. Peasants and artisans gradually drifted into\r\nthe cities, where the public distributions of grain, wine, and oil assured\r\nthem of a living with little expense and almost without exertion. In both\r\nItaly and the provinces there was a serious decline in the number of free\r\nfarmers and free workingmen.\r\n\r\n\"RACE SUICIDE\"\r\n\r\nBut slavery was not the only cause of depopulation. There was a great deal\r\nof what has been called \"race suicide\" in the old Roman world. Well-to-do\r\npeople, who could easily support large families, often refused to be\r\nburdened with them. Childlessness, however, was not confined to the\r\nwealthy, since the poorer classes, crowded in the huge lodging houses of\r\nthe cities, had no real family life. Roman emperors, who saw how difficult\r\nit was to get a sufficient number of recruits for the army, and how whole\r\ndistricts were going to waste for lack of people to cultivate them, tried\r\nto repopulate the empire by force of law. They imposed penalties for the\r\nchildlessness and celibacy of the rich, and founded institutions for the\r\nrearing of children, that the poor might not fear to raise large families.\r\nSuch measures were scarcely successful. \"Race suicide\" continued during\r\npagan times and even during the Christian age.\r\n\r\nLOSS OF REVENUES\r\n\r\nThe next most obvious element of weakness was the shrinkage of the\r\nrevenues. The empire suffered from want of money, as well as from want of\r\nmen. To meet the heavy cost of the luxurious court, to pay the salaries of\r\nthe swarms of public officials, to support the idle populace in the great\r\ncities required a vast annual income. But just when public expenditures\r\nwere rising by leaps and bounds, it became harder and harder to secure\r\nsufficient revenue. Smaller numbers meant fewer taxpayers. Fewer taxpayers\r\nmeant a heavier burden on those who survived to pay.\r\n\r\nECONOMIC RUIN\r\n\r\nThese two forces--the decline in population and the decline in wealth--\r\nworked together to produce economic ruin. It is no wonder, therefore, that\r\nin province after province large tracts of land went out of cultivation,\r\nthat the towns decayed, and that commerce and manufactures suffered an\r\nappalling decline. \"Hard times\" settled on the Roman world.\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nDoubtless still other forces were at work to weaken the state and make it\r\nincapable of further resistance to the barbarians. Among such forces we\r\nmust reckon Christianity itself. By the close of the fourth century\r\nChristianity had become the religion of the empire. The new faith, as we\r\nshall soon see, helped, not to support, but rather to undermine, pagan\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n77. THE PREPARATION FOR CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF PAGANISM\r\n\r\nSeveral centuries before the rise of Christianity many Greek thinkers\r\nbegan to feel a growing dissatisfaction with the crude faith that had come\r\ndown to them from prehistoric times. They found it more and more difficult\r\nto believe in the Olympian deities, who were fashioned like themselves and\r\nhad all the faults of mortal men. [10] An adulterous Zeus, a bloodthirsty\r\nAres, and a scolding Hera, as Homer represents them, were hardly\r\ndivinities that a cultured Greek could love and worship. For educated\r\nRomans, also, the rites and ceremonies of the ancient religion came\r\ngradually to lose their meaning. The worship of the Roman gods had never\r\nappealed to the emotions. Now it tended to pass into the mere mechanical\r\nrepetition of prayers and sacrifices. Even the worship of the Caesars,\r\n[11] which did much to hold the empire together, failed to satisfy the\r\nspiritual wants of mankind. It made no appeal to the moral nature; it\r\nbrought no message, either of fear or hope, about a future world and a\r\nlife beyond the grave.\r\n\r\nSTOICISM\r\n\r\nDuring these centuries a system of Greek philosophy, called Stoicism,\r\ngained many adherents among the Romans. Any one who will read the Stoic\r\nwritings, such as those of the noble emperor, Marcus Aurelius, [12] will\r\nsee how nearly Christian was the Stoic faith. It urged men to forgive\r\ninjuries--to \"bear and forbear.\" It preached the brotherhood of man. It\r\nexpressed a humble and unfaltering reliance on a divine Providence. To\r\nmany persons of refinement Stoicism became a real religion. But since\r\nStoic philosophy could reach and influence only the educated classes, it\r\ncould not become a religion for all sorts and conditions of men.\r\n\r\nTHE ELEUSINIAN MYSTERIES\r\n\r\nMany Greeks found a partial satisfaction of their religious longings in\r\nsecret rites called mysteries. Of these the most important grew up at\r\nEleusis, [13] a little Attic town thirteen miles from Athens. They were\r\nconnected with the worship of Demeter, goddess of vegetation and of the\r\nlife of nature. The celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries came in\r\nSeptember and lasted nine days. When the candidates for admission to the\r\nsecret rites were worked up to a state of religious excitement, they\r\nentered a brilliantly lighted hall and witnessed a passion play dealing\r\nwith the legend of Demeter. They seem to have had no direct moral\r\ninstruction but saw, instead, living pictures and pantomimes which\r\nrepresented the life beyond the grave and held out to them the promise of\r\na blessed lot in another world. As an Athenian orator said, \"Those who\r\nhave shared this initiation possess sweeter hopes about death and about\r\nthe whole of life.\" [14]\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE MYSTERIES\r\n\r\nThe Eleusinian mysteries, though unknown in the Homeric Age, were already\r\npopular before the epoch of the Persian wars. They became a Panhellenic\r\nfestival open to all Greeks, women as well as men, slaves as well as\r\nfreemen. The privilege of membership was later extended to Romans. During\r\nthe first centuries of our era the influence of the mysteries increased,\r\nas faith in the Olympian religion declined. They formed one of the last\r\nstrongholds of paganism and endured till the triumph of Christianity in\r\nthe Roman world.\r\n\r\nORIENTAL RELIGIONS IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic conquests of Alexander, followed in later centuries by the\r\nextension of Roman rule over the eastern coasts of the Mediterranean,\r\nbrought the classical peoples into contact with new religions which had\r\narisen in the Orient. Slaves, soldiers, traders, and travelers carried the\r\neastern faiths to the West, where they speedily won many followers. Even\r\nbefore the downfall of the republic the deities of Asia Minor, Egypt, and\r\nPersia had found a home at Rome. Under the empire many men and women were\r\nattracted to their worship.\r\n\r\nMITHRA\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable of the Asiatic religions was Mithraism. Mithra\r\nfirst appears as a Persian sun god, the leader of Ahuramazda's hosts in\r\nthe ceaseless struggle against the forces of darkness and evil. [15] As a\r\ngod of light Mithra was also a god of truth and purity. His worship,\r\nspreading over the length and breadth of the Roman Empire, became the\r\nnoblest of all pagan faiths. Men saw in Mithra a Lord and Giver of Life,\r\nwho protected the weak and miserable, cleansed the sinner, conquered\r\ndeath, and procured for his faithful followers the crown of immortality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MITHRAIC MONUMENT\r\nA bas relief discovered in 1838 A.D. in a cave near Heidelberg, Germany.\r\nThe central group represents Mithra slaying the bull. The smaller reliefs\r\nshow scenes from the life of Mithra, including his birth from the rock and\r\nhis ascent to Ahuramazda.]\r\n\r\nTHE WORSHIP OF MITHRA\r\n\r\nThe Mithraic worship took the form of a mystery with seven grades, or\r\ndegrees, through which candidates passed by ordeals of initiation. The\r\nrites included a kind of baptism with holy water, a sacrificial meal of\r\nbread and wine, and daily litanies to the sun. Mithra was represented as a\r\nyouthful hero miraculously born from a rock at the dawn of day; for this\r\nreason his worship was always conducted underground in natural or\r\nartificial caves, or in cellars. At the back of one of these subterranean\r\ntemples would be often a picture of Mithra slaying a bull, and an\r\ninscription: \"To the Unconquerable Sun, to Mithra.\" [16]\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE ORIENTAL RELIGIONS\r\n\r\nThe new Oriental religions all appealed to the emotions. They helped to\r\nsatisfy the spiritual wants of men and women, by dwelling on the need of\r\npurification from sin and by holding forth the prospect of a happier life\r\nbeyond the tomb. It is not strange, therefore, that they penetrated every\r\nprovince of the Roman Empire and flourished as late as the fourth century\r\nof our era. Christianity had no more dangerous antagonists than the\r\nfollowers of Mithra and other eastern divinities.\r\n\r\n\r\n78. RISE AND SPREAD OF CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nCHRISTIANITY AMONG THE JEWS\r\n\r\nChristianity rose among the Jews, for Jesus was a Jew and his disciples\r\nwere Jews. At the time of the death of Jesus [17] his immediate followers\r\nnumbered scarcely a Christianity hundred persons. The catastrophe of the\r\ncrucifixion struck them with sorrow and dismay. When, however, the\r\ndisciples came to believe in the resurrection of their master, a wonderful\r\nimpetus was given to the growth of the new religion. They now asserted\r\nthat Jesus was the true Messiah, or Christ, who by rising from the dead\r\nhad sealed the truth of his teachings. For several years after the\r\ncrucifixion, the disciples remained at Jerusalem, preaching and making\r\nconverts. The new doctrines met so much opposition on the part of Jewish\r\nleaders in the capital city that the followers of Jesus withdrew to\r\nSamaria, Damascus, and Antioch. In all these places there were large\r\nJewish communities, among whom Peter and his fellow apostles labored\r\nzealously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, PALESTINE IN THE TIME OF CHRIST]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MODERN JERUSALEM AND THE MOUNT OF OLIVES]\r\n\r\nMISSIONARY LABORS OF PAUL\r\n\r\nUp to this time the new faith had been spread only among the Jews. The\r\nfirst Christians did not neglect to keep up all the customs of the Jewish\r\nreligion. It was even doubted for a while whether any but Jews could\r\nproperly be allowed within the Christian fold. A new convert, Saul of\r\nTarsus, afterwards the Apostle Paul, did most to admit the Gentiles, or\r\npagans, to the privileges of the new religion. Though born a Jew, Paul had\r\nbeen trained in the schools of Tarsus, a city of Asia Minor which was a\r\ngreat center of Greek learning. He possessed a knowledge of Greek\r\nphilosophy, and particularly of Stoicism. This broad education helped to\r\nmake him an acceptable missionary to Greek-speaking peoples. During more\r\nthan thirty years of unceasing activity Paul established churches in Asia\r\nMinor, Greece, Macedonia, and Italy. To many of these churches he wrote\r\nthe letters (epistles), which have found a place in the New Testament. So\r\nlarge a part of the doctrines of Christianity has been derived from Paul's\r\nwritings that we may well speak of him as the second founder of the\r\nChristian faith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MADONNA AND CHILD\r\nThe earliest known representation of Mary and the infant Jesus. The\r\nprophet Isaiah is shown pointing to the new star. The picture dates from\r\nabout 200 A.D. and comes from the catacombs of St. Priscilla.]\r\n\r\nCHRISTIANITY AMONG THE GENTILES\r\n\r\nChristianity advanced with marvelous rapidity over the Roman world. At the\r\nclose of the first century there were Christians everywhere in Asia Minor.\r\nThe second century saw the establishment of flourishing churches in almost\r\nevery province of the empire. A hundred years later there were\r\nmissionaries along the Rhine, on the Danube frontier, and in distant\r\nBritain. \"We are but of yesterday,\" says a Christian writer, with\r\npardonable exaggeration, \"yet we have filled all your places of resort--\r\ncities, islands, fortresses, towns, markets, the camp itself, the tribes,\r\ntown councils, the palace, the senate, and the forum, We have left to you\r\nonly the temples of your gods.\" [18]\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS FAVORING THE SPREAD OF CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nCertain circumstances contributed to the success of this gigantic\r\nmissionary enterprise. Alexander's conquests in the East and those of Rome\r\nin the West had done much to remove the barriers to intercourse between\r\nnations. The spread of Greek and Latin as the common languages of the\r\nMediterranean world furnished a medium in which Christian speakers and\r\nwriters could be easily understood. The scattering of the Jews after the\r\ndestruction of Jerusalem [19] provided the Christians with an audience in\r\nmany cities of the empire. The early missionaries, such as Paul himself,\r\nwere often Roman citizens who enjoyed the protection of the Roman law and\r\nprofited by the ease of travel which the imperial rule had made possible.\r\nAt no other period in ancient history were conditions so favorable for the\r\nrapid spread of a new religion.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF EARLY CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nWhile Christianity was conquering the world, the believers in its\r\ndoctrines were grouping themselves into communities or churches. Every\r\ncity had a congregation of Christian worshipers. [20] They met, not in\r\nsynagogues as did the Jews, but in private houses, where they sang hymns,\r\nlistened to readings from the Holy Scriptures, and partook of a\r\nsacrificial meal in memory of the last supper of Jesus with his disciples.\r\nCertain officers called presbyters, [21] or elders, were chosen to conduct\r\nthe services and instruct the converts. The chief presbyter received the\r\nname of \"overseer,\" or bishop. [22] Each church had also one or more\r\ndeacons, who visited the sick and relieved the wants of the poor. Every\r\nChristian community thus formed a little brotherhood of earnest men and\r\nwomen, united by common beliefs and common hopes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRIST, THE GOOD SHEPHERD (Imperial Museum, Constantinople)\r\nThis quaint, rude figure, found in an early Christian tomb in Asia Minor,\r\ndates probably from the beginning of the third century. It is the oldest\r\nknown statue of Christ. He wears the coarse garb of an Oriental peasant;\r\nhis countenance is gentle and thoughtful; on his broad shoulders rests a\r\nlamb.]\r\n\r\n\r\n79. THE PERSECUTIONS\r\n\r\nHOSTILITY TOWARD THE CHRISTIANS\r\n\r\nThe new religion from the start met popular disapproval. The early\r\nChristians, who tried to keep themselves free from idolatry, were regarded\r\nas very unsociable persons. They never appeared at public feasts and\r\nentertainments. They would not join in the amusements of the circus or the\r\namphitheater. They refused to send their children to the schools. The\r\nordinary citizen could not understand such people. It is not surprising,\r\ntherefore, that they gained the evil name of \"haters of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nSUPERSTITIOUS FEAR OF THE CHRISTIANS\r\n\r\nIf the multitude despised the Christians, they sometimes feared them as\r\nwell. Strange stories circulated about the secret meetings of the\r\nChristians, who at their sacrificial meal were declared to feast on\r\nchildren. The Christians, too, were often looked upon as magicians who\r\ncaused all sorts of disasters. It was not difficult to excite the vicious\r\ncrowds of the larger cities to riots and disorders, in which many\r\nfollowers of the new religion lost their lives.\r\n\r\nANTAGONISM OF THE ROMAN GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nSuch outbursts of mob hatred were only occasional. There would have been\r\nno organized, persistent attack, if the imperial government had not taken\r\na hand. Rome, which had treated so many other foreign faiths with careless\r\nindifference or even with favor, which had tolerated the Jews and granted\r\nto them special privileges of worship, made a deliberate effort to crush\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\nATTITUDE OF THE CHRISTIANS TOWARD PAGANISM\r\n\r\nRome entered on the persecutions because it saw in Christianity that which\r\nthreatened its own existence. The Christians declined to support the state\r\nreligion; they even condemned it unsparingly as sinful and idolatrous. The\r\nChristians, moreover, would not worship the _genius_, or guardian spirit\r\nof the emperor, and would not burn incense before his statue, which stood\r\nin every town. Such a refusal to take what was really an oath of\r\nallegiance was regarded as an act of rebellion. These feelings of\r\nhostility to the Christians were strengthened by their unwillingness to\r\nserve in the army and to swear by the pagan gods in courts of law. In\r\nshort, the members of this new sect must have appeared very unruly\r\nsubjects who, if allowed to become numerous enough, would endanger the\r\nsecurity of the government.\r\n\r\nDIOCLETIAN'S PERSECUTION, 303-311 A.D.\r\n\r\nAs early as the beginning of the second century Roman officials began to\r\nsearch out and punish Christians, wherever they were found. During the\r\nthird century the entire power of the imperial government was directed\r\nagainst this outlawed sect. The persecution which began under Diocletian\r\nwas the last and most severe. With some interruptions it continued for\r\neight years. Only Gaul and Britain seem to have escaped its ravages. The\r\ngovernment began by burning the holy books of the Christians, by\r\ndestroying their churches, and by taking away their property. Members of\r\nthe hated faith lost their privileges as full Roman citizens. Then sterner\r\nmeasures followed. The prisons were crowded with Christians. Those who\r\nrefused to recant and sacrifice to the emperor were thrown to wild animals\r\nin the arena, stretched on the rack, or burned over a slow fire. Every\r\nrefinement of torture was practiced. Paganism, fighting for its existence,\r\nleft no means untried to root out a sect both despised and feared.\r\n\r\nTHE MARTYRS\r\n\r\nThe Christians joyfully suffered for their religion. They welcomed the\r\ntorture and death which would gain for them a heavenly crown. Those who\r\nperished were called martyrs, that is, \"witnesses.\" Even now the festal\r\nday of a martyr is the day of his death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE CATACOMBS\r\nThe catacombs of Rome are underground cemeteries in which the Christians\r\nburied their dead. The bodies were laid in recesses in the walls of the\r\ngalleries or underneath the pavement. Several tiers of galleries (in one\r\ninstance as many as seven) lie one below the other. Their total length has\r\nbeen estimated at no less than six hundred miles. The illustration shows a\r\nsmall chamber, or cubiculum. The graves have been opened and the bodies\r\ntaken away.]\r\n\r\n\r\n80. TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nCHRISTIANITY BECOMES A TOLERATED RELIGION\r\n\r\nDiocletian's persecution, which continued for several years after his\r\nabdication, came to an end in 311 A.D. In that year Galerius, the ruler in\r\nthe East, published an edict which permitted the Christians to rebuild\r\ntheir churches and worship undisturbed. It remained for the emperor\r\nConstantine to take the next significant step. In 313 A.D. Constantine and\r\nhis colleague, Licinius, issued the Edict of Milan, which proclaimed for\r\nthe first time in history the noble principle of religious toleration. It\r\ngave absolute freedom to every man to choose and follow the religion which\r\nhe deemed best suited to his needs. This edict placed the Christian faith\r\non an equality with paganism.\r\n\r\nCONSTANTINE'S CONVERSION\r\n\r\nThe conversion of Constantine is one of the most important events in\r\nancient history. A Roman emperor, himself a god to the subjects of Rome,\r\nbecame the worshiper of a crucified provincial of his empire. Constantine\r\nfavored the Christians throughput his reign. He surrounded himself with\r\nChristian bishops, freed the clergy from taxation, and spent large sums in\r\nbuilding churches. One of his laws abolished the use of the cross as an\r\ninstrument of punishment. Another enactment required that magistrates,\r\ncity people, and artisans were to rest on Sunday. This was the first\r\n\"Sunday law.\" [23]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LABARUM\r\nThe sacred military standard of the early Christian Roman emperors. First\r\nadopted by Constantine. It consisted of a staff or lance with a purple\r\nbanner on a cross-bar. The two Greek letters XP (CHR) make a monogram of\r\nthe word Christ (Greek _Christos_).]\r\n\r\nCHURCH COUNCIL AT NICAEA, 325 A.D.\r\n\r\nSignificant of the emperor's attitude toward Christianity was his action\r\nin summoning all the bishops in the different provinces to a gathering at\r\nNicaea in Asia Minor. It was the first general council of the Church. The\r\nprincipal work of the Council of Nicaea was the settlement of a great\r\ndispute which had arisen over the nature of Christ. Some theologians\r\nheaded by Arius, a priest of Alexandria, maintained that Christ the Son,\r\nhaving been created by God the Father, was necessarily inferior to him\r\nAthanasius, another Alexandrian priest, opposed this view and held that\r\nChrist was not a created being, but was in all ways equal to God. The\r\nCouncil accepted the arguments of Athanasius, condemned Arius as a\r\nheretic, and framed the Nicene Creed, which is still the accepted summary\r\nof Christian doctrine. Though thrust out of the Church, Arianism lived to\r\nflourish anew among the Germanic tribes, of which the majority were\r\nconverted to Christianity by Arian missionaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCH OF CONSTANTINE\r\nErected at Rome in 315 A.D. to commemorate the victory of Constantine over\r\nMaxentius. The monument consists of a central gateway and two smaller\r\narches flanked by detached columns in the Corinthian style. The arch is\r\ndecorated with four large statues in front of the upper story and also\r\nwith numerous sculptures in relief.]\r\n\r\nCHRISTIANITY BECOMES THE STATE RELIGION UNDER THEODOSIUS, 379-395 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe recognition given to Christianity by Constantine helped immensely to\r\nspread the new faith. The emperor Theodosius, whose services to the church\r\nwon him the title of \"the Great,\" made Christianity the state religion.\r\nSacrifices to the pagan gods were forbidden, the temples were closed, and\r\ntheir property was taken away. Those strongholds of the old paganism, the\r\nDelphic oracle, the Olympian games, and the Eleusinian mysteries, were\r\nabolished. Even the private worship of the household Lares and Penates\r\n[24] was prohibited. Though paganism lingered for a century or more in the\r\ncountry districts, it became extinct as a state religion by the end of the\r\nfourth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, THE GROWTH OF CHRISTIANITY TO THE END OF THE FOURTH\r\nCENTURY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n81. CHRISTIAN INFLUENCE ON SOCIETY\r\n\r\nMORAL TEACHINGS OF CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nThe new religion certainly helped to soften and refine manners by the\r\nstress which it laid upon such \"Christian\" virtues as humility,\r\ntenderness, and gentleness. By dwelling on the sanctity of human life,\r\nChristianity did its best to repress the very common practice of suicide\r\nas well as the frightful evil of infanticide. [25] It set its face sternly\r\nagainst the obscenities of the theater and the cruelties of the\r\ngladiatorial shows. [26] In these and other respects Christianity had much\r\nto do with the improvement of ancient morals.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL TEACHINGS OF CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nPerhaps even more original contributions of Christianity to civilization\r\nlay in its social teachings. The belief in the fatherhood of God implied a\r\ncorresponding belief in the brotherhood of man. This doctrine of the\r\nequality of men had been expressed before by ancient philosophers, but\r\nChristianity translated the precept into practice. In this way it helped\r\nto improve the condition of slaves and, by favoring emancipation, even\r\ntended to decrease slavery. [27] Christianity also laid much emphasis on\r\nthe virtue of charity and the duty of supporting all institutions which\r\naimed to relieve the lot of the poor, the sick, and the downtrodden.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIANITY AND THE GERMANS\r\n\r\nAt the close of the fourth century the Germanic tribes living nearest the\r\nfrontiers had been visited by missionaries and had become converts to\r\nChristianity. The fact that both Romans and Germans were Christians tended\r\nto lessen the terrors of the invasions and to bring about a peaceful\r\nfusion of the conquerors and the conquered.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

More probably, Constantine was only adding the\r\nday of the Sun, the worship of which was then firmly established in the\r\nempire (see page 229, note 1) to the other holy days of the Roman\r\ncalendar.\r\n\r\n[24] See page 146.\r\n\r\n[25] See page 253.\r\n\r\n[26] See page 267.\r\n\r\n[27] See page 270.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE GERMANS TO 476 A.D. [1]\r\n\r\n\r\n82. GERMANY AND THE GERMANS\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL FEATURES OF GERMANY\r\n\r\nThe Germans were an Indo-European people, as were their neighbors, the\r\nCelts of Gaul and Britain. They had lived for many centuries in the wild\r\ndistricts of central Europe north of the Alps and beyond the Danube and\r\nthe Rhine. This home land of the Germans in ancient times was cheerless\r\nand unhealthy. Dense forests or extensive marshes covered the ground. The\r\natmosphere was heavy and humid; in summer clouds and mists brooded over\r\nthe country; and in winter it was covered with snow and ice. In such a\r\nregion everything was opposed to civilization. Hence the Germans, though a\r\ngifted race, had not advanced as rapidly as the Greek and Italian peoples.\r\n\r\nTHE GERMANS DESCRIBED BY THE ROMANS\r\n\r\nOur earliest notice of the Germans is found in the _Commentaries_ by\r\nJulius Caesar, who twice invaded their country. About a century and a half\r\nlater the Roman historian, Tacitus, wrote a little book called Germany,\r\nwhich gives an account of the people as they were before coming under the\r\ninfluence of Rome and Christianity. Tacitus describes the Germans as\r\nbarbarians with many of the usual marks of barbarism. He speaks of their\r\ngiant size, their fierce, blue eyes, and their blonde or ruddy hair. These\r\nphysical traits made them seem especially terrible to the smaller and\r\ndarker Romans. He mentions their love of warfare, the fury of their onset\r\nin battle, and the contempt which they had for wounds and even death\r\nitself. When not fighting, they passed much of their time in the chase,\r\nand still more time in sleep and gluttonous feasts. They were hard\r\ndrinkers, too, and so passionately fond of gambling that, when a man's\r\nwealth was gone, he would even stake his liberty on a single game. In some\r\nof these respects the Germans resembled our own Indian tribes.\r\n\r\nGERMAN MORALS\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Germans had certain attractive qualities not always\r\nfound even among civilized peoples. They were hospitable to the stranger,\r\nthey respected their sworn word, they loved liberty and hated restraint.\r\nTheir chiefs, we are told, ruled rather by persuasion than by authority.\r\nAbove all, the Germans had a pure family life. \"Almost alone among\r\nbarbarians,\" writes Tacitus, \"they are content with one wife. No one in\r\nGermany laughs at vice, nor is it the fashion to corrupt and be corrupted.\r\nGood habits are here more effectual than good laws elsewhere.\" [2] The\r\nGermans, then, were strong and brave, hardy, chaste, and free.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF THE GERMANS\r\n\r\nThe Germans, during the three centuries between the time of Tacitus and\r\nthe beginning of the invasions, had advanced somewhat in civilization.\r\nThey were learning to live in towns instead of in rude villages, to read\r\nand write, to make better weapons and clothes, to use money, and to enjoy\r\nmany Roman luxuries, such as wine, spices, and ornaments. They were\r\nlikewise uniting in great confederations of tribes, ruled by kings who\r\nwere able to lead them in migrations to other lands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUNIC ALPHABET\r\nThe word \"rune\" comes from a Gothic word meaning a secret thing, a\r\nmystery. To the primitive Germans it seemed a mysterious thing that\r\nletters could be used to express thought. The art of writing with an\r\nalphabet appears to have been introduced into Germanic Europe during the\r\nfirst centuries of our era. Most Runic inscriptions have been found in\r\nDenmark and the Scandinavian peninsula.]\r\n\r\nREASONS FOR THE GERMANIC MIGRATIONS\r\n\r\nDuring this same period, also, the Germans increased rapidly in numbers.\r\nConsequently it was a difficult matter for them to live by hunting and\r\nfishing, or by such rude agriculture as their country allowed. They could\r\nfind additional land only in the fertile and well cultivated territories\r\nof the Romans. It was this hunger for land, together with the love of\r\nfighting and the desire for booty and adventure, which led to their\r\nmigrations.\r\n\r\nGROWING WEAKNESS OF ROME\r\n\r\nThe German inroads were neither sudden, nor unexpected, nor new. Since the\r\ndays of Marius and of Julius Caesar not a century had passed without\r\nwitnessing some dangerous movement of the northern barbarians. Until the\r\nclose of the fourth century Rome had always held their swarming hordes at\r\nbay. Nor were the invasions which at length destroyed the empire much more\r\nformidable than those which had been repulsed many times before. Rome fell\r\nbecause she could no longer resist with her earlier power. If the\r\nbarbarians were not growing stronger, the Romans themselves were steadily\r\ngrowing weaker. The form of the empire was still the same, but it had lost\r\nits vigor and its vitality. [3]\r\n\r\n\r\n83. BREAKING OF THE DANUBE BARRIER\r\n\r\nTHE GOTHS\r\n\r\nNorth of the Danube lived, near the close of the fourth century, a German\r\npeople called Visigoths, or West Goths. Their kinsmen, the Ostrogoths, or\r\nEast Goths, held the land north of the Black Sea between the Danube and\r\nthe Don. These two nations had been among the most dangerous enemies of\r\nRome. In the third century they made so many expeditions against the\r\neastern territories of the empire that Aurelian at last surrendered to the\r\nVisigoths the great province of Dacia. [4] The barbarians now came in\r\ncontact with Roman civilization and began to lead more settled lives. Some\r\nof them even accepted Christianity from Bishop Ulfilas, who translated the\r\nBible into the Gothic tongue.\r\n\r\nTHE VISIGOTHS CROSS THE DANUBE, 376 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe peaceful fusion of Goth and Roman might have gone on indefinitely but\r\nfor the sudden appearance in Europe of the Huns. They were a nomadic\r\npeople from central Asia. Entering Europe north of the Caspian Sea, the\r\nHuns quickly subdued the Ostrogoths and compelled them to unite in an\r\nattack upon their German kinsmen. Then the entire nation of Visigoths\r\ncrowded the banks of the Danube and begged the Roman authorities to allow\r\nthem to cross that river and place its broad waters between them and their\r\nterrible foes. In an evil hour for Rome their prayer was granted. At\r\nlength two hundred thousand Gothic warriors, with their wives and\r\nchildren, found a home on Roman soil.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF ADRIANOPLE, 378 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of such a host of barbarians within the frontier of the\r\nempire was in itself a dangerous thing. The danger was increased by the\r\nill treatment which the immigrants received. The Roman officials robbed\r\nthem of their possessions, withheld the promised supplies of food, and\r\neven tried to murder their leaders at a banquet. Finally, the Germans\r\nbroke out in open revolt. The emperor Valens misjudged their strength and\r\nrashly gave them battle near Adrianople in Thrace. The once invincible\r\nlegions fell an easy prey to their foes, and the emperor himself perished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PAGE OF THE GOTHIC GOSPELS (REDUCED)\r\nA manuscript of Ulfilas's translation of the Bible forms one of the\r\ntreasures of the library of the university of Upsala, Sweden. It is\r\nbeautifully written in letters of gold and silver on parchment of a rich\r\npurple dye. In making his version Ulfilas, who was himself a converted\r\nVisigoth, generally indicated the Gothic sounds by means of the Greek\r\nalphabet. He added, however, a few signs from the Runic alphabet, with\r\nwhich the Germans were familiar.]\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF THE BATTLE\r\n\r\nThe defeat at Adrianople is considered one of the few really decisive\r\nbattles in the world's history. It showed the barbarians that they could\r\nface the Romans in open fight and beat them. And it broke, once for all,\r\nthe Danube barrier. Swarms of fighting men, Ostrogoths as well as\r\nVisigoths, overran the provinces south of the Danube. The great ruler,\r\nTheodosius, [5] saved the empire for a time by granting lands to the\r\nGermans and by enrolling them in the army under the high-sounding title of\r\n\"allies.\" Until his death the Goths remained quiet--but it was only the\r\nlull before the storm.\r\n\r\nALARIC THE VISIGOTH\r\n\r\nTheodosius, \"the friend of the Goths,\" died in 395 A.D., leaving the\r\ndefense of the Roman world to his weakling sons, Arcadius and Honorius. In\r\nthe same year the Visigoths raised one of their young nobles, named\r\nAlaric, upon a shield and with joyful shouts acclaimed him as their king.\r\nThe Visigothic leader despised the service of Rome. His people, he\r\nthought, should be masters, not servants. Alaric determined to lead them\r\ninto the very heart of the empire, where they might find fertile lands and\r\nsettle once for all.\r\n\r\nALARIC IN GREECE AND ITALY\r\n\r\nAlaric at first fixed his attention on Constantinople. Realizing, at\r\nlength, how hopeless would be the siege of that great city, he turned\r\ntoward the west and descended upon Greece. The Germans marched unopposed\r\nthrough the pass of Thermopylae and devastated central Greece, as the\r\nPersians had done nearly nine centuries before. [6] Then the barbarians\r\nentered the Peloponnesus, but were soon driven out by Stilicho, a German\r\nchieftain who had risen to the command of the army of Honorius. Alaric\r\ngave up Greece only to invade Italy. Before long the Goths crossed the\r\nJulian Alps and entered the rich and defenseless valley of the Po. To meet\r\nthe crisis the legions were hastily called in, even from the distant\r\nfrontiers. Stilicho formed them into a powerful army, beat back the enemy,\r\nand captured the Visigothic camp, filled with the spoil of Greek cities.\r\nIn the eyes of the Romans Stilicho seemed a second Marius, who had arisen\r\nin an hour of peril to save Italy from its barbarian foes. [7]\r\n\r\nTHE VISIGOTHS BEFORE ROME\r\n\r\nAlaric and his Goths had been repulsed; they had not been destroyed.\r\nBeyond the Alps they were regaining their shattered strength and biding\r\ntheir time. Their opportunity came soon enough, when Honorius caused\r\nStilicho to be put to death on a charge of plotting to seize the throne.\r\nThe accusation may have been true, but in killing Stilicho the emperor had\r\ncut off his right hand with his left. Now that Stilicho was out of the\r\nway, Alaric no longer feared to descend again on Italy. The Goths advanced\r\nrapidly southward past Ravenna, where Honorius had shut himself up in\r\nterror, and made straight for Rome. In 410 A.D., just eight hundred years\r\nafter the sack of the city by the Gauls, [8] Rome found the Germans within\r\nher gates.\r\n\r\nSACK OF ROME BY THE VISIGOTHS, 410 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe city for three days and nights was given up to pillage. Alaric, who\r\nwas a Christian, ordered his followers to respect the churches and their\r\nproperty and to refrain from bloodshed. Though the city did not greatly\r\nsuffer, the moral effect of the disaster was immense. Rome the eternal,\r\nthe unconquerable, she who had taken captive all the world, was now\r\nherself a captive. The pagans saw in this calamity the vengeance of the\r\nancient deities, who had been dishonored and driven from their shrines.\r\nThe Christians believed that God had sent a judgment on the Romans to\r\npunish them for their sins. In either case the spell of Rome was forever\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nKINGDOM OF THE VISIGOTHS, 415-711 A.D.\r\n\r\nFrom Rome Alaric led his hosts, laden with plunder, into southern Italy.\r\nHe may have intended to cross the Mediterranean and bring Africa under his\r\nrule. The plan was never carried out, for the youthful chieftain died\r\nsuddenly, a victim to the Italian fever. After Alaric's death, the\r\nbarbarians made their way northward through Italy and settled in southern\r\nGaul and Spain. In these lands they founded an independent Visigothic\r\nkingdom, the first to be created on Roman soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, THE GERMANIC MIGRATIONS to 476 A.D.]\r\n\r\nROMANIZATION OF THE VISIGOTHS\r\n\r\nThe possessions of the Visigoths in Gaul were seized by their neighbors,\r\nthe Franks, in less than a century; [9] but the Gothic kingdom in Spain\r\nhad three hundred years of prosperous life. [10] The barbarian rulers\r\nsought to preserve the institutions of Rome and to respect the rights of\r\ntheir Roman subjects. Conquerors and conquered gradually blended into one\r\npeople, out of whom have grown the Spaniards of modern times.\r\n\r\n\r\n84. BREAKING OF THE RHINE BARRIER\r\n\r\nTHE GERMANS CROSS THE RHINE, 406 A.D.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the Visigoths Rome and Italy remained undisturbed\r\nfor nearly forty years. The western provinces were not so fortunate. At\r\nthe time of Alaric's first attack on Italy the legions along the Rhine had\r\nbeen withdrawn to meet him, leaving the frontier unguarded. In 406 A.D.,\r\nfour years before Alaric's sack of Rome, a vast company of Germans crossed\r\nthe Rhine and swept almost unopposed through Gaul. Some of these peoples\r\nsucceeded in establishing kingdoms for themselves on the ruins of the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nKINGDOM OF THE BURGUNDIANS, 443-534 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Burgundians settled on the upper Rhine and in the fertile valley of\r\nthe Rhone, in southeastern Gaul. Alter less than a century of independence\r\nthey were conquered by the Franks. [11] Their name, however, survives in\r\nmodern Burgundy.\r\n\r\nVANDAL KINGDOM IN NORTH AFRICA, 429-534 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Vandals settled first in Spain. The territory now called Andalusia\r\nstill preserves the memory of these barbarians. After the Visigothic\r\ninvasion of Spain the Vandals passed over to North Africa. They made\r\nthemselves masters of Carthage and soon conquered all the Roman province\r\nof Africa. Their kingdom here lasted about one hundred years. [12]\r\n\r\nTHE FRANKS IN NORTHERN GAUL\r\n\r\nWhile the Visigoths were finding a home in the districts north and south\r\nof the Pyrenees, the Burgundians in the Rhone valley, and the Vandals in\r\nAfrica, still another Germanic people began to spread over northern Gaul.\r\nThey were the Franks, who had long held lands on both sides of the lower\r\nRhine. The Franks, unlike the other Germans, were not of a roving\r\ndisposition. They contented themselves with a gradual advance into Roman\r\nterritory. It was not until near the close of the fifth century that they\r\noverthrew the Roman power in northern Gaul and began to form the Frankish\r\nkingdom, out of which modern France has grown.\r\n\r\nTHE ANGLES AND SAXONS IN BRITAIN, FROM 449 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe troubled years of the fifth century saw also the beginning of the\r\nGermanic conquest of Britain. The withdrawal of the legions from that\r\nisland left it defenseless, for the Celtic inhabitants were too weak to\r\ndefend themselves. Bands of savage Picts from Scotland swarmed over\r\nHadrian's Wall, attacking the Britons in the rear. Ireland sent forth the\r\nno less savage Scots. The eastern coasts, at the same time, were\r\nconstantly exposed to raids by German pirates. The Britons, in their\r\nextremity, adopted the old Roman practice of getting the barbarians to\r\nfight for them. Bands of Jutes were invited over from Denmark in 449 A.D.\r\nThe Jutes forced back the Picts and then settled in Britain as conquerors.\r\nFresh swarms of invaders followed them, chiefly Angles from what is now\r\nSchleswig-Holstein and Saxons from the neighborhood of the rivers Elbe and\r\nWeser in northern Germany. The invaders subdued nearly all that part of\r\nBritain that Rome had previously conquered. In this way the Angles and\r\nSaxons became ancestors of the English people, and Engleland became\r\nEngland. [13]\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL SITUATION IN 451 A.D.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the fifth century the larger part of the Roman Empire in\r\nthe West had come under barbarian control. The Germans ruled in Africa,\r\nSpain, Britain, and parts of Gaul. But now the new Germanic kingdoms,\r\ntogether with what remained of the old empire, were threatened by a common\r\nfoe--the terrible Huns.\r\n\r\n\r\n85. INROADS OF THE HUNS\r\n\r\nTHE HUNS\r\n\r\nWe know very little about the Huns, except that they were not related to\r\nthe Germans or to any other European people. Some scholars believe them to\r\nhave belonged to the Mongolian race. But the Huns, to the excited\r\nimagination of Roman writers, were demons rather than men. Their olive\r\nskins, little, turned-up noses, and black, beady eyes must have given them\r\na very frightful appearance. They spent most of their time on horseback,\r\nsweeping over the country like a whirlwind and leaving destruction and\r\ndeath in their wake.\r\n\r\nATTILA THE HUN\r\n\r\nThe Huns did not become dangerous to Rome for more than half a century\r\nafter their first appearance in Europe. [14] During this time they moved\r\ninto the Danube region and settled in the lands now known as Austria and\r\nHungary. At last the Huns found a national leader in Attila, \"a man born\r\ninto the world to agitate the nations, the fear of all lands,\" [15] one\r\nwhose boast it was that the grass never grew again where his horse's hoofs\r\nhad trod. He quickly built up a great military power obeyed by many\r\nbarbarous nations from the Caspian to the Rhine.\r\n\r\nINVASION OF GAUL BY ATTILA\r\n\r\nAttila, from his capital on the Danube, could threaten both the East and\r\nthe West. The emperors at Constantinople bought him off with lavish gifts,\r\nand so the robber-ruler turned to the western provinces for his prey. In\r\n451 A.D. he led his motley host, said to number half a million men, across\r\nthe Rhine. Many a noble municipality with its still active Roman life was\r\nvisited by the Huns with fire and sword. Paris, it is worthy of note,\r\nescaped destruction. That now famous city was then only a little village\r\non an island in the Seine.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF CHÂLONS, 451 A.D.\r\n\r\nIn this hour of danger Romans and Germans gave up quarreling and united\r\nagainst the common foe. Visigoths under their native king hastened from\r\nSpain; Burgundians and Franks joined their ranks; to these forces a German\r\ngeneral, named Aëtius, added the last Roman army in the West. Opposed to\r\nthem Attila had his Huns, the conquered Ostrogoths, and many other\r\nbarbarian peoples. The battle of Châlons has well been called a struggle\r\nof the nations. It was one of the fiercest conflicts recorded in history.\r\nOn both sides thousands perished, but so many more of Attila's men fell\r\nthat he dared not risk a fresh encounter on the following day. He drew his\r\nshattered forces together and retreated beyond the Rhine.\r\n\r\nATTILA INVADES ITALY, 452 A.D.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this setback Attila did not abandon the hope of conquest. The\r\nnext year he led his still formidable army over the Julian Alps and burned\r\nor plundered many towns of northern Italy. A few trembling fugitives\r\nsought shelter on the islands at the head of the Adriatic. Out of their\r\nrude huts grew up in the Middle Ages splendid and famous Venice, a city\r\nthat in later centuries was to help defend Europe against those kinsmen of\r\nthe Huns, the Turks.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF ATTILA, 453 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe fiery Hun did not long survive this Italian expedition. Within a year\r\nhe was dead, dying suddenly, it was said, in a drunken sleep. The great\r\nconfederacy which he had formed broke up after his death. The German\r\nsubjects gained their freedom, and the Huns themselves either withdrew to\r\ntheir Asiatic wilds or mingled with the peoples they had conquered. Europe\r\nbreathed again; the nightmare was over.\r\n\r\n\r\n86. END OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE IN THE WEST, 476 A.D.\r\n\r\nVANDAL PIRATES\r\n\r\nRome escaped a visitation by the Huns only to fall a victim, three years\r\nlater, to the Vandals. After the capture of Carthage,[16] these barbarians\r\nmade that city the seat of a pirate empire. Putting out in their long,\r\nlight vessels, they swept the seas and raided many a populous city on the\r\nMediterranean coast. So terrible were their inroads that the word\r\n\"vandalism\" has come to mean the wanton destruction of property.\r\n\r\nSACK OF ROME BY THE VANDALS, 455 A.D.\r\n\r\nIn 455 A.D. the ships of the Vandals, led by their king, Gaiseric,\r\nappeared at the mouth of the Tiber. The Romans could offer no resistance.\r\nOnly the noble bishop Leo went out with his clergy to meet the invader and\r\nintercede for the city. Gaiseric promised to spare the lives of the\r\ninhabitants and not to destroy the public buildings. These were the best\r\nterms he would grant. The Vandals spent fourteen days stripping Rome of\r\nher wealth. Besides shiploads of booty the Vandals took away thousands of\r\nRomans as slaves, including the widow and two daughters of an emperor.\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN EMPIRE IN THE WEST, 455-476 A.D.\r\n\r\nAfter the Vandal sack of Rome the imperial throne became the mere\r\nplaything of the army and its leaders. A German commander, named Ricimer,\r\nset up and deposed four puppet emperors within five years. He was, in\r\nfact, the real ruler of Italy at this time. After his death Orestes,\r\nanother German general, went a step beyond Ricimer's policy and placed his\r\nown son on the throne of the Caesars. By a curious coincidence, this lad\r\nbore the name of Romulus, legendary founder of Rome, and the nickname of\r\nAugustulus (\"the little Augustus\"). The boy emperor reigned less than a\r\nyear. The German troops clamored for a third of the lands of Italy and,\r\nwhen their demand was refused, proclaimed Odoacer king. The poor little\r\nemperor, Romulus Augustulus, was sent to a villa near Naples, where he\r\ndisappears from history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, EUROPE at the Deposition of Romulus Augustulus 476\r\nA.D.]\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL SITUATION IN 476 A.D.\r\n\r\nThere was now no emperor in the West. To the men of that time it seemed\r\nthat East and West had been once more joined under a single ruler, as in\r\nthe days of Constantine. The emperors who reigned at Constantinople did\r\nnot relinquish their claims to be regarded as the rightful sovereigns in\r\nItaly and Rome. Nevertheless, as an actual fact, Roman rule in the West\r\nwas now all but extinct. Odoacer, the head of the barbarians in Italy,\r\nruled a kingdom as independent as that of the Vandals in Africa or that of\r\nthe Visigoths in Spain and Gaul. The date 476 A.D. may therefore be chosen\r\nas marking, better than any other, the overthrow of the Roman Empire in\r\nthe West by the Germans.\r\n\r\n\r\n87. GERMANIC INFLUENCE ON SOCIETY\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE GERMANIC INVASIONS\r\n\r\nClassical civilization suffered a great shock when the Germans descended\r\non the empire and from its provinces carved out their kingdoms. These\r\nbarbarians were rude in manners, were very ignorant, and had little taste\r\nfor anything except fighting and bodily enjoyments. They were unlike the\r\nRomans in dress and habits of life. They lived under different laws, spoke\r\ndifferent languages, obeyed different rulers. Their invasions naturally\r\nushered in a long period of confusion and disorder, during which the new\r\nrace slowly raised itself to a level of culture somewhat approaching that\r\nwhich the Greeks and the Romans had attained.\r\n\r\nRETROGRESSIVE FORCES\r\n\r\nThe Germans in many ways did injury to classical civilization. They\r\nsometimes destroyed Roman cities and killed or enslaved the inhabitants.\r\nEven when the invaders settled peaceably in the empire, they took\r\npossession of the land and set up their own tribal governments in place of\r\nthe Roman. They allowed aqueducts, bridges, and roads to go without\r\nrepairs, and theaters, baths, and other public buildings to sink into\r\nruins. Having no appreciation of education, the Germans failed to keep up\r\nthe schools, universities, and libraries. Being devoted chiefly to\r\nagriculture, they had no need for foreign wares or costly articles of\r\nluxury, and hence they permitted industry and commerce to languish. In\r\nshort, large parts of western Europe, particularly Gaul, Spain, and\r\nBritain, fell backward into a condition of ignorance, superstition, and\r\neven barbarism.\r\n\r\nPROGRESSIVE FORCES\r\n\r\nBut in closing our survey of the Germanic invasions we need to dwell on\r\nthe forces that made for progress, rather than on those that made for\r\ndecline. Classical civilization, we have already found reason to believe,\r\n[17] had begun to decay long before the Germans broke up the empire. The\r\nGermans came, as Christianity had come, only to hasten the process of\r\ndecay. Each of these influences, in turn, worked to build up the fabric of\r\na new society on the ruins of the old. First Christianity infused the\r\npagan world with its quickening spirit and gave a new religion to mankind.\r\nLater followed the Germans, who accepted Christianity, who adopted much of\r\nGraeco-Roman culture, and then contributed their fresh blood and youthful\r\nminds and their own vigorous life.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

Comment on this statement: \"The Germans had stolen their way into the\r\nvery citadel of the empire long before its distant outworks were stormed.\"\r\n\r\n7. Why is modern civilization, unlike that of antiquity, in little danger\r\nfrom barbarians?\r\n\r\n8. Why has the battle of Adrianople been called \"the Cannae of the fourth\r\ncentury\"?\r\n\r\n9. Why has Alaric been styled \"the Moses of the Visigoths\"?\r\n\r\n10. What is the origin of the geographical names Andalusia, Burgundy,\r\nEngland, and France?\r\n\r\n11. Why was Attila called the \"scourge of God\"?\r\n\r\n12. Can you suggest a reason why some historians do not regard Châlons as\r\none of the world's decisive battles?\r\n\r\n13. In what sense does the date, 476 A.D., mark the \"fall\" of the Roman\r\nEmpire?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Webster, _Readings in Ancient History_, chapter xxiii, \"The Germans as\r\nDescribed by Tacitus.\"\r\n\r\n[2] Tacitus, _Germania_, 19.\r\n\r\n[3] See pages 224-226.\r\n\r\n[4] See page 219.\r\n\r\n[5] See page 223.\r\n\r\n[6] See page 98.\r\n\r\n[7] See page 178.\r\n\r\n[8] See page 153.\r\n\r\n[9] See page 303.\r\n\r\n[10] See page 378.\r\n\r\n[11] See page 303.\r\n\r\n[12] See page 330.\r\n\r\n[13] The invasion of Britain by the Anglo-Saxons was followed by the\r\nmigration across the Channel of large numbers of the defeated islanders.\r\nThe district in France where they settled is called after them, Brittany.\r\n\r\n[14] See page 241.\r\n\r\n[15] Jordanes, _De rebus Geticis_, 35.\r\n\r\n[16] See page 225.\r\n\r\n[17] See page 224.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCLASSICAL CIVILIZATION [1]\r\n\r\n\r\n88. THE CLASSICAL CITY\r\n\r\nTHE CENTER OF CLASSICAL LIFE\r\n\r\nThe history of the Greeks and Romans ought not to be studied only in their\r\npolitical development and the biographies of their great statesmen and\r\nwarriors. We must also know something of ancient literature, philosophy,\r\nand art. Especially do we need to learn about the private life of the\r\nclassical peoples--their manners, customs, occupations, and amusements.\r\nThis life centered in the city.\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE CITY\r\n\r\nA Greek or a Roman city usually grew up about a hill of refuge\r\n(_acropolis, capitolium_), to which the people of the surrounding district\r\ncould flee in time of danger. The hill would be crowned with a fortress\r\nand the temples of the gods. Not far away was the market place (_agora,\r\nforum_), where the people gathered to conduct their business and to enjoy\r\nsocial intercourse. About the citadel and market place were grouped the\r\nnarrow streets and low houses of the town.\r\n\r\nGENERAL APPEARANCE OF AN ANCIENT CITY\r\n\r\nThe largest and most beautiful buildings in an ancient city were always\r\nthe temples, colonnades, and other public structures. The houses of\r\nprivate individuals, for the most part, had few pretensions to beauty.\r\nThey were insignificant in appearance and were often built with only one\r\nstory. From a distance, however, their whitewashed walls and red-tiled\r\nroofs, shining brightly under the warm sun, must have made an attractive\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nLIFE IN THE CITY\r\n\r\nTo the free-born inhabitant of Athens or of Rome his city was at once his\r\ncountry and his church, his club and his home. He shared in its\r\ngovernment; he took part in the stately ceremonies that honored its patron\r\ngod; in the city he could indulge his taste for talking and for politics;\r\nhere he found both safety and society. No wonder that an Athenian or a\r\nRoman learned, from early childhood, to love his city with passionate\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n89. EDUCATION AND THE CONDITION OF CHILDREN\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF MALE CHILDREN\r\n\r\nThe coming of a child, to parents in antiquity as to parents now, was\r\nusually a very happy event. Especially welcome was the birth of a son. The\r\nfather felt assured that through the boy his old age would be cared for\r\nand that the family name and the worship of the family ancestors would be\r\nkept up after his own death. \"Male children,\" said an ancient poet, \"are\r\nthe pillars of the house.\" [2] The city, as well, had an interest in the\r\nmatter, for a male child meant another citizen able to take the father's\r\nplace in the army and the public assembly. To have no children was\r\nregarded as one of the greatest calamities that could befall a Greek or a\r\nRoman.\r\n\r\nINFANTICIDE\r\n\r\nThe ancient attitude toward children was in one respect very unlike our\r\nown. The law allowed a father to do whatever he pleased with a newly born\r\nchild. If he was very poor, or if his child was deformed, he could expose\r\nit in some desert spot, where it soon died. An infant was sometimes placed\r\nsecretly in a temple, where possibly some kind-hearted person might rescue\r\nit. The child, in this case, became the slave of its adopter. This custom\r\nof exposure, an inheritance from prehistoric savagery, tended to grow less\r\ncommon with advancing culture. The complete abolition of infanticide was\r\ndue to the spread of Christian teachings about the sacredness of human\r\nlife. [3]\r\n\r\nNAMES\r\n\r\nA Greek boy generally had but one name. The favorite name for the eldest\r\nson was that of his paternal grandfather. A father, however, might give\r\nhim his own name or that of an intimate friend. The Romans at first seem\r\nto have used only the one name, then two were given; and later we have the\r\nfamiliar three-fold name, representing the individual, the clan, and the\r\nfamily. [4]\r\n\r\nGREEK EDUCATION\r\n\r\nGreek education consisted of three main branches, known as gymnastics,\r\nmusic, and grammar. By gymnastics the Greeks meant the physical training\r\nin the palestra, an open stretch of ground on the outskirts of the city.\r\nHere a private teacher gave instruction in the various athletic sports\r\nwhich were so popular at the national games. The training in music was\r\nintended to improve the moral nature of young men and to fit them for\r\npleasant social intercourse. They were taught to play a stringed\r\ninstrument, called the lyre, and at the same time to sing to their own\r\naccompaniment. Grammar, the third branch of education, included\r\ninstruction in writing and the reading of the national literature. After a\r\nboy had learned to write and to read, the schoolmaster took up with him\r\nthe works of the epic poets, especially Homer, besides _Aesop's Fables_\r\nand other popular compositions. The student learned by heart much of the\r\npoetry and at so early an age that he always remembered it. Not a few\r\nAthenians, it is said, could recite the entire _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ATHENIAN SCHOOL (Royal Museum, Berlin)\r\nA painting by Duris on a drinking-cup, or cylix. The picture is divided by\r\nthe two handles. In the upper half, beginning at the left: a youth playing\r\nthe double flute as a lesson to the boy before him; a teacher holding a\r\ntablet and stylus and correcting a composition; a slave (_paedagogus_),\r\nwho accompanied the children to and from school. In the lower half: a\r\nmaster teaching his pupil to play the lyre; a teacher holding a half-\r\nopened roll, listening to a recitation by the student before him; a\r\nbearded _paedagogus_. The inner picture, badly damaged, represents a youth\r\nin a bath.]\r\n\r\nROMAN EDUCATION\r\n\r\nA Roman boy began his school days at about the age of seven. He learned to\r\nread, to write with a stylus on wax tablets, and to cipher by means of the\r\nreckoning board, or abacus. He received a little instruction in singing\r\nand memorized all sorts of proverbs and maxims, besides the laws of the\r\nTwelve Tables. [5] His studying went on under the watchful eyes of a harsh\r\nschoolmaster, who did not hesitate to use the rod. After Rome began to\r\ncome into close contact with Greece, the curriculum was enlarged by the\r\nstudy of literature. The Romans were the first people who made the\r\nlearning of a foreign tongue an essential part of education. Schools now\r\narose in which the Greek language and literature formed the chief subject\r\nof instruction. As Latin literature came into being, its productions,\r\nespecially the orations of Cicero and the poems of Vergil and Horace, were\r\nalso used as texts for study.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ROMAN SCHOOL SCENE\r\nWall painting, Herculaneum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUTH READING A PAPYRUS ROLL\r\nRelief on a sarcophagus. The papyrus roll was sometimes very long. The\r\nentire _Iliad_ or _Odyssey_ might be contained in a single manuscript\r\nmeasuring one hundred and fifty feet in length. In the third century A.D.\r\nthe unwieldy roll began to give way to the tablet, composed of a number of\r\nleaves held together by a ring. About this time, also, the use of vellum,\r\nor parchment made of sheepskin, became common.]\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AND STUDY ABROAD\r\n\r\nPersons of wealth or noble birth might follow their school training by a\r\nuniversity course at a Greek city, such as Athens, Alexandria, or Rhodes.\r\nHere the Roman youth would listen to lectures on philosophy, delivered by\r\nthe deep thinkers whom Greece still produced, and would profit by the\r\ntreasures of art and science preserved in these ancient capitals. Many\r\nfamous Romans thus passed several years abroad in graduate study. During\r\nthe imperial age, as we have already seen, [6] schools of grammar and\r\nrhetoric arose in the West, particularly in Gaul and Spain, and attracted\r\nstudents from all parts of the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n90. MARRIAGE AND THE POSITION OF WOMEN\r\n\r\nENGAGEMENTS\r\n\r\nA young man in Athens or in Rome did not, as a rule, marry immediately on\r\ncoming of age. He might remain a bachelor for several years, sometimes\r\ntill he was thirty or over. The young man's father had most to do with the\r\nselection of a wife. He tried to secure for his son some daughter of a\r\nfriend who possessed rank and property equal to his own. The parents of\r\nthe two parties would then enter into a contract which, among other\r\nthings, usually stated how large a dowry the bride's father was to settle\r\non his daughter. An engagement was usually very little a matter of romance\r\nand very much a matter of business.\r\n\r\nWEDDING CUSTOMS\r\n\r\nThe wedding customs of the Greeks and Romans presented many likenesses.\r\nMarriage, among both peoples, was a religious ceremony. On the appointed\r\nday the principals and their guests, dressed in holiday attire, met at the\r\nhouse of the bride. In the case of a Roman wedding the auspices [7] were\r\nthen taken, and the words of the nuptial contract were pronounced in the\r\npresence of witnesses. After a solemn sacrifice to the gods of marriage,\r\nthe guests partook of the wedding banquet. When night came on, the husband\r\nbrought his wife to her new abode, escorted by a procession of\r\ntorchbearers, musicians, and friends, who sang the happy wedding song.\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF WOMEN\r\n\r\nAn Athenian wife, during her younger years, always remained more or less a\r\nprisoner. She could not go out except by permission. She took no part in\r\nthe banquets and entertainments which her husband gave. She lived a life\r\nof confinement in that quarter of the house assigned to the women for\r\ntheir special abode. Married women at Rome enjoyed a far more honorable\r\nposition. Although early custom placed the wife, together with her\r\nchildren, in the power of the husband, [8] still she possessed many\r\nprivileges. She did not remain all the time at home, but mingled freely in\r\nsociety. She was the friend and confidante of her husband, as well as his\r\nhousekeeper. During the great days of Roman history the women showed\r\nthemselves virtuous and dignified, loving wives and excellent companions.\r\n\r\n\r\n91. THE HOME AND PRIVATE LIFE\r\n\r\nCLOTHING\r\n\r\nThere were no great differences between the dress of the two classical\r\npeoples. Both wore the long, loosely flowing robes that contrast so\r\nsharply with our tight-fitting garments. [9] Athenian male attire\r\nconsisted of but two articles, the tunic and the mantle. The tunic was an\r\nundergarment of wool or linen, without sleeves. Over this was thrown a\r\nlarge woolen mantle, so wrapped about the figure as to leave free only the\r\nright shoulder and head. In the house a man wore only his tunic; out of\r\ndoors and on the street he usually wore the mantle over it. Very similar\r\nto the two main articles of Greek clothing were the Roman _tunica_ and\r\n_toga_. [10]\r\n\r\nCOVERING FOR THE HEAD AND FEET\r\n\r\nOn a journey or out in the country broad-brimmed hats were used to shield\r\nthe head from the sun. In rainy weather the mantle, pulled up over the\r\nhead, furnished protection. Sandals, merely flat soles of wood or leather\r\nfastened by thongs, were worn indoors, but even these were laid aside at a\r\ndinner party. Outside the house leather shoes of various shapes and colors\r\nwere used. They cannot have been very comfortable, since stockings were\r\nnot known in antiquity.\r\n\r\nEXTERIOR OF THE HOUSE\r\n\r\nThe ancient house lay close to the street line. The exterior was plain and\r\nsimple to an extreme. The owner was satisfied if his mansion shut out the\r\nnoise and dust of the highway. He built it, therefore, round one or more\r\nopen courts, which took the place of windows supplying light and air.\r\nExcept for the doorway the front of the house presented a bare, blank\r\nsurface, only relieved by narrow slits or lattices in the wall of the\r\nupper story. The street side of the house wall received a coating of\r\nwhitewash or of fine marble stucco. The roof of the house was covered with\r\nclay tiles. This style of domestic architecture is still common in eastern\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE OF THE VETTII AT POMPEII (RESTORED)\r\nNotice the large area of blank wall both on the front and on the side. The\r\nfront windows are very small and evidently of less importance for\r\nadmitting light than the openings of the two _atria_. At the back is seen\r\nthe large, well-lighted peristyle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ATRIUM OF POMPEIAN HOUSE\r\nThe view shows the _atrium_ with the basin for rainwater, in the center\r\nthe _tabinum_ with its wall paintings, and the peristyle at the rear.]\r\n\r\nINTERIOR OF THE HOUSE\r\n\r\nIn contrast with its unpretentious exterior a classical dwelling indoors\r\nhad a most attractive appearance. We cannot exactly determine just what\r\nwere the arrangements of a Greek interior. But the better class of Roman\r\nhouses, such as some of those excavated at Pompeii, [11] followed Greek\r\ndesigns in many respects. The Pompeian remains, therefore, will give some\r\nidea of the sort of residence occupied by a well-to-do citizen of Athens\r\nor Rome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POMPEIAN FLOOR MOSAIC]\r\n\r\nTHE ATRIUM\r\n\r\nThe visitor at one of these ancient houses first entered a small\r\nvestibule, from which a narrow passage led to the heavy oaken door. A dog\r\nwas sometimes kept chained in this hallway; in Pompeii there is a picture\r\nof one worked in mosaic on the floor with the warning beneath it, \"Beware\r\nof the dog.\" Having made known his presence by using the knocker, the\r\nguest was ushered into the reception room, or _atrium_. This was a large\r\napartment covered with a roof, except for a hole in the center admitting\r\nlight and air. A marble basin directly underneath caught the rain water\r\nwhich came through the opening. The _atrium_ represents the single room of\r\nthe primitive Roman house without windows or chimney. [12]\r\n\r\nTHE PERISTYLE\r\n\r\nA corridor from the _atrium_ led into the _peristyle_, the second of the\r\ntwo main sections of a Roman house. It was a spacious court, open to the\r\nsky and inclosed by a colonnade or portico. This delightful spot, rather\r\nthan the formal _atrium_, served as the center of family life. About it\r\nwere grouped the bedchambers, bathrooms, dining rooms, kitchen, and other\r\napartments of a comfortable mansion. Still other rooms occupied the upper\r\nstories of the dwelling.\r\n\r\nBUSINESS OF THE FORENOON\r\n\r\nThe ancient Athenian was no sluggard. At sunrise, or even before, he rose\r\nfrom his couch, washed his face and hands, put on his scanty garments, and\r\nwas soon ready for the street. Before leaving the house, he broke his fast\r\nwith a meal as simple as the European \"rolls and coffee\"--in this case\r\nmerely a few mouthfuls of bread dipped in wine. After breakfast he might\r\ncall on his friends or perhaps ride into the country and visit his\r\nestates. About ten o'clock (which the Athenians called \"full market\"), he\r\nwould be pretty sure to find his way to the Agora. The shops at this time\r\nwere crowded with purchasers, and every sociable citizen of Athens was to\r\nbe found in them or in the neighboring colonnades which lined the market\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERISTYLE OF A POMPEIAN HOUSE\r\nHouse of the Vettii Pompeii. The peristyle, excavated in 1894-1895 A.D.\r\nhas been carefully restored. The garden, fountains, tables, and marble\r\ncolonnades are all modern]\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS IN THE AFTERNOON\r\n\r\nThe public resorts were deserted at noon, when the Athenian returned home\r\nto enjoy a light meal and a rest during the heat. As the day grew cooler,\r\nmen again went out and visited a gymnasium, such as the Lyceum or the\r\nAcademy, in the city suburbs. [13] Here were grounds for running,\r\nwrestling, discus-throwing, and other sports, as well as rooms for bathing\r\nand anointing. While the younger men busied themselves in such active\r\nexercises, those of maturer years might be content with less vigorous\r\ngames or with conversation on political or philosophical themes.\r\n\r\nTHE EVENING MEAL\r\n\r\nThe principal meal of the day came about sunset. The master of the house,\r\nif he had no guests, shared the repast with his wife and children. For a\r\nman of moderate means the ordinary fare was very much what it is now in\r\nGreece--bread, olives, figs, cheese, and a little meat as an occasional\r\nluxury. At the end of the meal the diners refreshed themselves with wine\r\nmixed with water. The Greeks appear to have been usually as temperate in\r\ntheir drink as they were frugal in their food. The remainder of the\r\nevening would be devoted to conversation and music and possibly a little\r\nreading. As a rule the Athenian went early to bed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GREEK BANQUET\r\nFrom a vase painting by Duns.]\r\n\r\nMORNING ROUND OF A ROMAN NOBLE\r\n\r\nA Roman of the higher class, who lived in late republican or early\r\nimperial times, passed through much the same daily routine as an Athenian\r\ncitizen in the days of Pericles. He rose at an early hour and after a\r\nlight breakfast dispatched his private business with the help of his\r\nsteward and manager. He then took his place in the _atrium_ to meet the\r\ncrowd of poor dependents who came to pay their respects to their patron\r\nand to receive their usual morning alms--either food or sufficient money\r\nto buy a modest dinner. Having greeted his visitors and perhaps helped\r\nthem in legal or business matters, the noble entered his litter and was\r\ncarried down to the Forum. Here he might attend the law courts to plead a\r\ncase for himself or for his clients. If he were a member of the Senate, he\r\nwould take part in the deliberations of that body. At eleven o'clock, when\r\nthe ordinary duties of the morning were over, he would return home to eat\r\nhis luncheon and enjoy the midday rest, or siesta. The practice of having\r\na nap in the heat of the day became so general that at noon the streets of\r\na Roman city had the same deserted appearance as at midnight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ROMAN LITTER\r\nThe litter consists of an ordinary couch with four posts and a pair of\r\npoles. Curtains fastened to the rod above the canopy shielded the occupant\r\nfrom observation.]\r\n\r\nTHE AFTERNOON EXERCISE AND BATH\r\n\r\nAfter an hour of refreshing sleep it was time for the regular exercise out\r\nof doors in the Campus Martius or indoors at one of the large city baths.\r\nThen came one of the chief pleasures of a Roman's existence--the daily\r\nbath. It was taken ordinarily in one of the public bathing establishments,\r\nor _thermae_, to be found in every Roman town. [14] A Roman bath was a\r\nluxurious affair. After undressing, the bathers entered a warm anteroom\r\nand sat for a time on benches, in order to perspire freely. This was a\r\nprecaution against the danger of passing too suddenly into the hot bath,\r\nwhich was taken in a large tank of water sunk in the middle of the floor.\r\nThen came an exhilarating cold plunge and anointing with perfumed oil.\r\nAfterwards the bathers rested on the couches with which the resort was\r\nsupplied and passed the time in reading or conversation until the hour for\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nTHE LATE DINNER\r\n\r\nThe late dinner, with the Romans as with the Greeks, formed the principal\r\nmeal of the day. It was usually a social function. The host and his guests\r\nreclined on couches arranged about a table. The Romans borrowed from the\r\nGreeks the custom of ending a banquet with a symposium, or drinking-bout.\r\nThe tables were cleared of dishes, and the guests were anointed with\r\nperfumes and crowned with garlands. During the banquet and the symposium\r\nit was customary for professional performers to entertain the guests with\r\nmusic, dancing, pantomimes, and feats of jugglery.\r\n\r\n\r\n92. AMUSEMENTS\r\n\r\nATHENIAN RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS\r\n\r\nThe Athenians celebrated many religious festivals. One of the most\r\nimportant was the Great Panathenaea, [15] held every fourth year in the\r\nmonth of July. Athletic contests and poetical recitations, sacrifices,\r\nfeasts, and processions honored the goddess Athena, who presided over the\r\nAthenian city. Even more interesting, perhaps, were the dramatic\r\nperformances held in midwinter and in spring, at the festivals of\r\nDionysus. The tragedies and comedies composed for these entertainments\r\ntook their place among the masterpieces of Greek literature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEATER OF DIONYSUS, ATHENS\r\nThe theater of Dionysus where dramatic exhibitions were held lay close to\r\nthe south eastern angle of the Acropolis. The audience at first sat upon\r\nwooden benches rising tier after tier on the adjacent hillside. About the\r\nmiddle of the fourth century B.C. these were replaced by the stone seats\r\nwhich are still to be seen. Sixteen thousand people could be accommodated\r\nin this open air theater.]\r\n\r\nFEATURES OF A GREEK PLAY\r\n\r\nThere is very little likeness between the ancient and the modern drama.\r\nGreek plays were performed out of doors in the bright sunlight. Until late\r\nRoman times it is unlikely that a raised stage existed. The three actors\r\nand the members of the chorus appeared together in the dancing ring, or\r\norchestra. The performers were all men. Each actor might play several\r\nparts. There was no elaborate scenery; the spectator had to rely chiefly\r\non his own imagination for the setting of the piece. The actors indulged\r\nin few lively movements or gestures. They must have looked from a distance\r\nlike a group of majestic statues. All wore elaborate costumes, and tragic\r\nactors, in addition, were made to appear larger than human with masks,\r\npadding, and thick-soled boots, or buskins. The performances occupied the\r\nthree days of the Dionysiac festivals, beginning early in the morning and\r\nlasting till night. All this time was necessary because they formed\r\ncontests for a prize which the people awarded to the poet and chorus whose\r\npresentation was judged of highest excellence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DANCING GIRL\r\nA Greek bronze statuette found in a sunken galley off the coast of Tunis.\r\nThe galley had been wrecked while on its way to Rome carrying a load of\r\nart objects to decorate the villas of wealthy nobles. This statuette was\r\ndoubtless a life-like copy of some well-known entertainer. The dancer's\r\npose suggests the American \"cakewalk\" and her costume, the modern \"hobble\r\nskirt.\"]\r\n\r\nPANTOMIME AND VAUDEVILLE AT ROME\r\n\r\nPantomimes formed the staple amusement of the Roman theater. In these\r\nperformances a single dancer, by movements and gestures, represented\r\nmythological scenes and love stories. The actor took several characters in\r\nsuccession and a chorus accompanied him with songs. There were also\r\n\"vaudeville\" entertainments, with all manner of jugglers, ropedancers,\r\nacrobats, and clowns, to amuse a people who found no pleasure in the\r\nrefined productions of the Greek stage.\r\n\r\nCHARIOT RACES\r\n\r\nFar more popular than even pantomime and vaudeville were the \"games of the\r\ncircus.\" At Rome these were held chiefly in the Circus Maximus. Chariot\r\nraces formed the principal attraction of the circus. There were usually\r\nfour horses to a chariot, though sometimes the drivers showed their skill\r\nby handling as many as six or seven horses. The contestants whirled seven\r\ntimes around the low wall, or _spina_, which divided the race course. The\r\nshortness of the stretches and the sharp turns about the _spina_ must have\r\nprevented the attainment of great speed. A race, nevertheless, was a most\r\nexciting sport. What we should call \"fouling\" was permitted and even\r\nencouraged. The driver might turn his team against another or might\r\nendeavor to upset a rival's car. It was a very tame contest that did not\r\nhave its accompaniment of broken chariots, fallen horses, and killed or\r\ninjured drivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CIRCUS MAXIMUS (RESTORATION)]\r\n\r\nANIMAL BAITINGS\r\n\r\nThe Circus Maximus was often used for a variety of animal shows. Fierce\r\nwild beasts, brought from every quarter of the empire, were turned loose\r\nto slaughter one another, or to tear to pieces condemned criminals. [16]\r\nMore popular still were the contests between savage animals and men. Such\r\namusements did something to satisfy the lust for blood in the Roman\r\npopulace--a lust which was more completely satisfied by the gladiatorial\r\ncombats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLADIATORS\r\nFrom a stucco relief on the tomb of Scaurus, Pompeii. Beginning at the\r\nleft are two fully armed horsemen fighting with lances. Behind them are\r\ntwo gladiators, one of whom is appealing to the people. Then follows a\r\ncombat in which the defeated party raises his hand in supplication for\r\nmercy. The lower part of the relief represents fights with various wild\r\nbeasts.]\r\n\r\nGLADIATORIAL SHOWS\r\n\r\nExhibitions of gladiators were known in Italy long before they became\r\npopular at Rome. The combats probably started from the savage practice of\r\nsacrificing prisoners or slaves at the funeral of their master. Then the\r\ncustom arose of allowing the victims a chance for their lives by having\r\nthem fight one another, the conquerors being spared for future battles.\r\nFrom this it was but a step to keeping trained slaves as gladiators.\r\nDuring the imperial epoch the number of such exhibitions increased\r\ngreatly. The emperor Trajan, for example, to celebrate his victories over\r\nthe Dacians, [17] exhibited no less than ten thousand men within the space\r\nof four months. The gladiators belonged to various classes, according to\r\nthe defensive armor they wore and the style of fighting they employed.\r\nWhen a man was wounded and unable to continue the struggle, he might\r\nappeal to the spectators. He lifted his finger to plead for release; if he\r\nhad fought well, the people indicated their willingness to spare him by\r\nwaving their handkerchiefs. If the spectators were in a cruel mood, they\r\nturned down their thumbs as the signal for his deathblow. These hideous\r\nexhibitions continued in different parts of the Roman Empire until the\r\nfifth century of our era.\r\n\r\n\"BREAD AND THE GAMES OF THE CIRCUS.\"\r\n\r\nGladiatorial combats, chariot races, and dramatic shows were free\r\nperformances. For the lower classes in the Roman city they became the\r\nchief pleasure of life. The days of their celebration were public\r\nholidays, which in the fourth century numbered no less than one hundred\r\nand seventy-five. The once-sovereign people of Rome became a lazy,\r\nworthless rabble, fed by the state and amused with the games. It was well\r\nsaid by an ancient satirist that the Romans wanted only two things to make\r\nthem happy--\"bread and the games of the circus.\" [18]\r\n\r\n\r\n93. SLAVERY\r\n\r\nPLACE OF SLAVERY IN CLASSICAL LIFE\r\n\r\nThe private life of the Greeks and Romans, as described in the preceding\r\npages, would have been impossible without the existence of a large servile\r\nclass. Slaves did much of the heavy and disagreeable work in the ancient\r\nworld, thus allowing the free citizen to engage in more honorable\r\nemployment or to pass his days in dignified leisure.\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF SLAVES\r\n\r\nThe Greeks seem sometimes to have thought that only barbarians should be\r\ndegraded to the condition of servitude. Most Greek slaves, as a matter of\r\nfact, were purchased from foreign countries. But after the Romans had\r\nsubdued the Mediterranean world, their captives included not only members\r\nof inferior races, but also the cultivated inhabitants of Greece, Egypt,\r\nand Asia Minor. We hear of slaves at Rome who served as clerks,\r\nsecretaries, librarians, actors, and musicians. Their education was often\r\nsuperior to that of the coarse and brutal masters who owned them.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND CHEAPNESS OF SLAVES\r\n\r\nThe number of slaves, though great enough in Athens and other Greek\r\ncities, reached almost incredible figures during the later period of Roman\r\nhistory. Every victorious battle swelled the troops of captives sent to\r\nthe slave markets at Rome. Ordinary slaves became as cheap as beasts of\r\nburden are now. The Roman poet Horace tells us that at least ten slaves\r\nwere necessary for a gentleman in even moderate circumstances. Wealthy\r\nindividuals, given to excessive luxury, might number their city slaves by\r\nthe hundreds, besides many more on their country estates.\r\n\r\nSLAVES' TASKS\r\n\r\nSlaves engaged in a great variety of occupations. They were domestic\r\nservants, farm laborers, miners, artisans, factory hands, and even\r\nshopkeepers. Household slaves at Rome were employed in every conceivable\r\nway. Each part of a rich man's residence had its special staff of\r\nservants. The possession of a fine troop of slaves, dressed in handsome\r\nliveries, was a favorite method of showing one's wealth and luxury.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF SLAVES\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for us to realize the attitude of ancient peoples toward\r\ntheir slaves. They were regarded as part of the chattels of the house--as\r\non a level with domestic animals rather than human beings. Though Athenian\r\nlaw forbade owners to kill their slaves or to treat them cruelly, it\r\npermitted the corporal punishment of slaves for slight offenses. At Rome,\r\nuntil the imperial epoch, [19] no restraints whatever existed upon the\r\nmaster's power. A slave was part of his property with which he could do\r\nexactly as he pleased. The terrible punishments, the beating with scourges\r\nwhich followed the slightest misconduct or neglect of duty, the branding\r\nwith a hot iron which a runaway slave received, the fearful penalty of\r\ncrucifixion which followed an attempt upon the owner's life--all these\r\ntortures show how hard was the lot of the bondman in pagan Rome.\r\n\r\nPOSSIBILITIES OF FREEDOM\r\n\r\nA slave, under some circumstances, could gain his freedom. In Greece,\r\nwhere many little states constantly at war bordered one another, a slave\r\ncould often run away to liberty. In a great empire like Rome, where no\r\nboundary lines existed, this was usually impossible. Freedom, however, was\r\nsometimes voluntarily granted. A master in his will might liberate his\r\nfavorite slave, as a reward for the faithful service of a lifetime. A more\r\ncommon practice permitted the slave to keep a part of his earnings until\r\nhe had saved enough to purchase his freedom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SLAVE'S COLLAR\r\nA runaway slave, if recaptured, was sometimes compelled to wear a metal\r\ncollar riveted about his neck. One of these collars, still preserved at\r\nRome, bears the inscription: _Servus sum dom(i)ni mei Scholastici v(iri)\r\nsp(ectabüis). Tene me ne fugiam de domo._--\"I am the slave of my master\r\nScholasticus, a gentleman of importance. Hold me, lest I flee from home.\"]\r\n\r\nPERMANENCE OF SLAVERY\r\n\r\nSlavery in Greece and Italy had existed from the earliest times. It never\r\nwas more flourishing than in the great age of classical history. Nor did\r\nit pass away when the Roman world became Christian. The spread of\r\nChristianity certainly helped to improve the lot of the slave and to\r\nencourage his liberation. The Church, nevertheless, recognized slavery\r\nfrom the beginning. Not until long after ancient civilization had perished\r\ndid the curse of slavery finally disappear from European lands. [20]\r\n\r\n\r\n94. GREEK LITERATURE\r\n\r\nEPIC POETRY\r\n\r\nThe literature of Greece begins with epic poetry. An epic may be defined\r\nas a long narrative in verse, dealing with some large and noble theme. The\r\nearliest epic poetry of the Greeks was inseparable from music. Wandering\r\nminstrels sang at feasts in the palaces of kings and accompanied their\r\nlays with the music of the clear-toned lyre. In time, as his verse reached\r\na more artistic character, the singer was able to give up the lyre and to\r\ndepend for effect solely on the poetic power of his narrative. Finally,\r\nthe scattered lays were combined into long poems. The most famous are the\r\n_Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_, works which the Greeks attributed to Homer.\r\n[21]\r\n\r\nLYRIC POETRY\r\n\r\nSeveral centuries after Homer the Greeks began to create a new form of\r\npoetic expression--lyric poetry. In short poems, accompanied by the flute\r\nor the lyre, they found a medium for the expression of personal feelings\r\nwhich was not furnished by the long and cumbrous epic. The greatest lyric\r\npoet was Pindar. We still possess forty-four of his odes, which were\r\nwritten in honor of victorious athletes at the Olympian and other national\r\ngames. [22] Pindar's verses were so popular that he became, as it were,\r\nthe \"poet laureate\" of Greece. When Alexander the Great destroyed Thebes,\r\n[23] the native town of Pindar, he spared that poet's birthplace from the\r\ngeneral ruin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOPHOCLES (Lateran Museum, Rome)\r\nThis marble statue is possibly a copy of the bronze original which the\r\nAthenians set up in the theater of Dionysus. The feet and the box of\r\nmanuscript rolls are modern restorations.]\r\n\r\nATHENIAN TRAGEDY\r\n\r\nThe three great masters of the tragic drama [24] lived and wrote in Athens\r\nduring the splendid half century between the Persian and the Peloponnesian\r\nwars. Such was the fertility of their genius that they are said to have\r\nwritten altogether nearly three hundred plays. Only thirty-two have come\r\ndown to us. Aeschylus, the first of the tragic poets, had fought at\r\nMarathon and Salamis. One of his works, the _Persians_, is a magnificent\r\nsong of triumph for the victory of Hellas. Sophocles, while yet a young\r\nman, gained the prize in a dramatic contest with Aeschylus. His plays mark\r\nthe perfection of Greek tragedy. After the death of Sophocles the\r\nAthenians revered him as a hero and honored his memory with yearly\r\nsacrifices. Euripides was the third of the Athenian dramatists and the\r\nmost generally popular. His fame reached far beyond his native city. We\r\nare told that the Sicilians were so fond of his verses that they granted\r\nfreedom to every one of the Athenian prisoners captured at Syracuse who\r\ncould recite the poet's lines.\r\n\r\nATHENIAN COMEDY\r\n\r\nAthenian comedy during the fifth century B.C. is represented by the plays\r\nof Aristophanes. He was both a great poet and a great satirist. In one\r\ncomedy Aristophanes attacks the demagogue Cleon, who was prominent in\r\nAthenian politics after the death of Pericles. In other comedies he\r\nridicules the philosophers, makes fun of the ordinary citizen's delight in\r\nsitting on jury courts and trying cases, and criticizes those responsible\r\nfor the unfortunate expedition to Sicily. The plays of Aristophanes were\r\nperformed before admiring audiences of thousands of citizens and hence\r\nmust have had much influence on public opinion.\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\nThe \"father of history,\" Herodotus, flourished about the middle of the\r\nfifth century B.C. Though a native of Asia Minor, Herodotus spent some of\r\nthe best years of his life at Athens, mingling in its brilliant society\r\nand coming under the influences, literary and artistic, of that city. He\r\ntraveled widely in the Greek world and in the East, as a preparation for\r\nhis great task of writing an account of the rise of the Oriental nations\r\nand the struggle between Greece and Persia. Herodotus was not a critical\r\nhistorian, diligently sifting truth from fable. Where he can he gives us\r\nfacts. Where facts are lacking, he tells interesting stories in a most\r\nwinning style. A much more scientific writer was Thucydides, an Athenian\r\nwho lived during the epoch of the Peloponnesian War and became the\r\nhistorian of that contest. An Athenian contemporary of Thucydides,\r\nXenophon, is best known from his _Anabasis_, which describes the famous\r\nexpedition of the \"Ten Thousand\" Greeks against Persia. [25]\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nOf the later prose writers of Greece it is sufficient to name only one--\r\nthe immortal Plutarch. He was a native of Chaeronea in Boeotia and lived\r\nduring the first century of our era. Greece at that time was only a\r\nprovince of the Roman Empire; the days of her greatness had long since\r\npassed away. Plutarch thus had rather a melancholy task in writing his\r\n_Parallel Lives_. In this work he relates, first the life of an eminent\r\nGreek, then of a famous Roman who in some way resembled him; and ends the\r\naccount with a short comparison of the two men. Plutarch had a wonderful\r\ngift of sympathy for his heroes and a keen eye for what was dramatic in\r\ntheir careers. It is not surprising, therefore, that Plutarch has always\r\nbeen a favorite author. No other ancient writer gives us so vivid and\r\nintimate a picture of the classical world.\r\n\r\nORIGINALITY OF GREEK LITERATURE\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing survey it is clear that the Greeks were pioneers in\r\nmany forms of literature. They first composed artistic epic poems. They\r\ninvented lyric and dramatic poetry. They were the first to write histories\r\nand biographies. In oratory, as has been seen, they also rose to eminence.\r\n[26] We shall now find that the Greek intellect was no less fertile and\r\noriginal in the study of philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n95. GREEK PHILOSOPHY\r\n\r\nTHE SOPHISTS\r\n\r\nThe Greek philosophy took its rise in the seventh century B.C., when a few\r\nbold students began to search out the mysteries of the universe. Their\r\ntheories were so many and so contradictory, however, that after a time\r\nphilosophers gave up the study of nature and proposed in turn to study man\r\nhimself. These later thinkers were called sophists. They traveled\r\nthroughout Greece, gathering the young men about them and lecturing for\r\npay on subjects of practical interest. Among other things they taught the\r\nrhetoric and oratory which were needed for success in a public career.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES\r\n\r\nOne of the founders of Greek philosophy and the greatest teacher of his\r\nage was Socrates the Athenian. He lived and taught during the period of\r\nthe Peloponnesian War. Socrates resembled the sophists in his possession\r\nof an inquiring, skeptical mind which questioned every common belief and\r\nsuperstition. But he went beyond the sophists in his emphasis on problems\r\nof every-day morality.\r\n\r\nThough Socrates wrote nothing, his teaching and personality made a deep\r\nimpression on his contemporaries. The Delphic oracle declared that no one\r\nin the world was wiser than Socrates. Yet he lived through a long life at\r\nAthens, a poor man who would neither work at his trade of sculptor, nor\r\n(as did the sophists) accept money for his instruction. He walked the\r\nstreets, barefoot and half-clad, and engaged in animated conversation with\r\nanyone who was willing to discuss intellectual subjects with him. Socrates\r\nmust have been a familiar figure to the Athenians. His short body, large,\r\nbald head, and homely features hardly presented the ideal of a\r\nphilosopher. Even Aristophanes in a comedy laughs at him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOCRATES (Vatican Gallery, Rome)]\r\n\r\nCONDEMNATION AND DEATH OF SOCRATES\r\n\r\nLate in life Socrates was accused of impiety and of corrupting the youth\r\nof Athens with his doctrines. As a matter of fact he was a deeply\r\nreligious man. If he objected to the crude mythology of Homer, he often\r\nspoke of one God, who ruled the world, and of a divine spirit or\r\nconscience within his own breast. A jury court found him guilty, however,\r\nand condemned him to death. He refused to escape from prison when\r\nopportunity offered and passed his last days in eager conversation on the\r\nimmortality of the soul. When the hour of departure arrived, he bade his\r\ndisciples farewell and calmly drained the cup of hemlock, a poison that\r\ncaused a painless death. Although Socrates gave his life for his\r\nphilosophy, this did not perish with him.\r\n\r\nPLATO\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the Socratic circle was Plato, a wealthy noble who\r\nabandoned a public career for the attractions of philosophy. After the\r\ndeath of Socrates, Plato traveled widely in the Greek world and even\r\nvisited Egypt, where he interviewed the learned priests. On his return to\r\nAthens Plato began teaching in the garden and gymnasium called the\r\nAcademy. [27] His writings, known as _Dialogues_, are cast in the form of\r\nquestion and answer that Socrates had used. In most of them Plato makes\r\nSocrates the chief speaker. Plato's works are both profound in thought and\r\nadmirable in style. The Athenians used to say that if Zeus had spoken\r\nGreek he would have spoken it as did Plato.\r\n\r\nARISTOTLE\r\n\r\nAs great a philosopher as Plato, but a far less attractive writer, was\r\nAristotle. He was not an Athenian by birth, but he passed many years in\r\nAthens, first as a pupil of Plato, who called him the \"mind\" of the\r\nschool, and then as a teacher in the Athenian city. Aristotle seems to\r\nhave taken all knowledge for his province. He investigated the ideas\r\nunderlying the arts of rhetoric and poetry; he gathered the constitutions\r\nof many Greek states and drew from them some general principles of\r\npolitics; he studied collections of strange plants and animals to learn\r\ntheir structure and habits; he examined the acts and beliefs of men in\r\norder to write books on ethics. In all this investigation Aristotle was\r\nnot content to accept what previous men had written or to spin a pleasing\r\ntheory out of his own brain. Everywhere he sought for facts; everything he\r\ntried to bring to the test of personal observation. Aristotle, then, was\r\nas much a scientist as a philosopher. His books were reverently studied\r\nfor centuries after his death and are still used in our universities.\r\n\r\nEPICUREANISM\r\n\r\nThe system of philosophy called Epicureanism was founded by a Greek named\r\nEpicurus. He taught in Athens during the earlier part of the third century\r\nB.C. Epicurus believed that pleasure is the sole good, pain, the sole\r\nevil. He meant by pleasure not so much the passing enjoyments of the hour\r\nas the permanent happiness of a lifetime. In order to be happy men should\r\nnot trouble themselves with useless luxuries, but should lead the \"simple\r\nlife.\" They must be virtuous, for virtue will bring more real satisfaction\r\nthan vice. Above all, men ought to free themselves from idle hopes and\r\nfears about a future existence. The belief in the immortality of the soul,\r\nsaid Epicurus, is only a delusion, for both soul and body are material\r\nthings which death dissolves into the atoms making up the universe. And if\r\nthere are any gods, he declared, they do not concern themselves with human\r\naffairs. Some of the followers of Epicurus seemed to find in his\r\nphilosophic system justification for free indulgence in every appetite and\r\npassion. Even to-day, when we call a person an \"Epicurean,\" we think of\r\nhim as a selfish pleasure seeker.\r\n\r\nSTOICISM\r\n\r\nThe noblest of all pagan philosophies was Stoicism, founded by Zeno, a\r\ncontemporary of Epicurus. Virtue, said the Stoic, consists in living\r\n\"according to nature,\" that is, according to the Universal Reason or\r\nDivine Providence that rules the world. The followers of this philosophy\r\ntried, therefore, to ignore the feelings and exalt the reason as a guide\r\nto conduct. They practiced self-denial, despised the pomps and vanities of\r\nthe world, and sought to rise above such emotions as grief, fear, hope,\r\nand joy. The doctrines of Stoicism gained many adherents among the Romans\r\n[28] and through them became a real moral force in the ancient world.\r\nStoicism is even now no outworn creed. Our very word \"stoical\" is a\r\nsynonym for calm indifference to pleasure or to pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n96. ROMAN LITERATURE\r\n\r\nRISE OF ROMAN LITERATURE\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of Roman literature go back to the third century B.C., when\r\nsome knowledge of the Greek language became increasingly common in Rome.\r\nThe earlier writers--chiefly poets and dramatists--did little original\r\nwork, and usually were content to translate and adapt the productions of\r\nGreek authors for Roman audiences. During this period the Romans gradually\r\ndiscovered the capabilities of their language for prose composition. The\r\nrepublican institutions of Rome, like those of Athens, were highly\r\nfavorable to the art of public speaking. It was the development of oratory\r\nwhich did most to mold the Latin language into fitness for the varied\r\nforms of prose.\r\n\r\nCICERO\r\n\r\nCicero, the greatest of Roman orators, created a style for Latin prose\r\ncomposition which has been admired and imitated by men of letters even to\r\nour own day. Latin, in his hands, became a magnificent instrument for the\r\nexpression of human thought. Cicero's qualities as an author are shown,\r\nnot only by his _Orations_, but also by the numerous _Epistles_ which he\r\nwrote to friends and correspondents in all parts of the Roman world.\r\nBesides their historical interest Cicero's letters are models of what good\r\nletters ought to be--the expression of the writer's real thoughts and\r\nfeelings in simple, unstilted language. Cicero also composed a number of\r\n_Dialogues_, chiefly on philosophical themes. If not very profound, they\r\nare delightfully written, and long served as textbooks in the schools.\r\n\r\nCAESAR\r\n\r\nAnother eminent statesman--Julius Caesar--won success in literature. As an\r\norator he was admitted by his contemporaries to stand second to Cicero.\r\nNone of his speeches have survived. We possess, however, his invaluable\r\n_Commentaries_ on the Gallic and Civil wars. These works, though brief and\r\nin most parts rather dull, are highly praised for their simple, concise\r\nstyle and their mastery of the art of rapid narration.\r\n\r\nVERGIL AND HORACE\r\n\r\nThe half century included within the Augustan Age marks a real epoch in\r\nthe history of Latin literature. The most famous poet of this period was\r\nVergil. The _Aeneid_, which he undertook at the suggestion of Augustus, is\r\nhis best-known work. In form the poem is a narrative of the adventures of\r\nthe Trojan hero, Aeneas, [29] but its real theme is the growth of Rome\r\nunder the fostering care of the gods. The _Aeneid_, though unfinished at\r\nthe author's death, became at once what it has always remained--the only\r\nancient epic worthy of comparison with the _Iliad_ or with the _Odyssey._\r\nAnother member of the Augustan circle was Vergil's friend and fellow-\r\nworker, Horace. An imitative poet, Horace reproduced in Latin verse the\r\nforms, and sometimes even the substance, of his Greek models. But, like\r\nVergil, what Horace borrowed he made his own by the added beauty which he\r\ngave to it. His _Odes_ are perhaps the most admirable examples of literary\r\nart to be found in any language.\r\n\r\nLIVY\r\n\r\nThe most famous prose writer of the Augustan Age was Livy. His _History of\r\nRome_, beginning with Romulus and extending to Augustus, traced the rise\r\nand growth of the Roman state during eight centuries of triumphal\r\nprogress. It did in prose what Vergil's _Aeneid_ had done in verse.\r\n\r\nTACITUS\r\n\r\nThe period of the \"Good Emperors\" saw the rise of several important\r\nauthors, of whom one, the historian Tacitus, was a man of genius. The\r\ncrowning labor of his life was a history of Rome from Tiberius to\r\nDomitian. Of this work, issued under the two titles of _Histories_ and\r\n_Annals_, only about one-half is extant.\r\n\r\nSURVIVAL OF ROMAN LITERATURE\r\n\r\nLess than two hundred years separate Cicero and Tacitus. During this\r\nperiod Latin authors, writing under the influence of old Greece,\r\naccomplished much valuable work. Some of their productions are scarcely\r\ninferior to the Greek masterpieces. In later centuries, when Greek\r\nliterature was either neglected or forgotten in the West, the literature\r\nof Rome was still read and enjoyed. Even to-day a knowledge of it forms an\r\nessential part of a \"classical\" education.\r\n\r\n\r\n97. GREEK ARCHITECTURE\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF GREEK ARCHITECTURE\r\n\r\nThe existing monuments of Greek architecture--chiefly ruined temples--\r\nafford some idea of its leading characteristics. The building materials\r\nwere limestone and white marble. The blocks of stone were not bound\r\ntogether by cement, but by metal clamps which held them in a firm grip. It\r\nwas usual to color the ornamental parts of a temple and the open spaces\r\nthat served as a background for sculpture. The Greeks did not employ the\r\nprinciple of the arch, in order to cover large spaces with a vaulted\r\nceiling. Their temples and other public buildings had only flat ceilings,\r\nresting on long rows of columns. The column probably developed from the\r\nwooden post or tree trunk used in timber construction. The capital at the\r\ntop of the column originated in the square wooden slab which supported the\r\nheavy beam of the roof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORNER OF A DORIC FAÇADE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORNER OF AN IONIC FAÇADE]\r\n\r\nTHE DORIC COLUMN\r\n\r\nThe two Greek orders of architecture, Doric and Ionic, [30] are\r\ndistinguished mainly by differences in the treatment of the column. The\r\nDoric column has no base of its own. The sturdy shaft is grooved\r\nlengthwise with some twenty flutings. The capital is a circular band of\r\nstone capped by a square block, all without decoration. The mainland of\r\nGreece was the especial home of the Doric order. This was also the\r\ncharacteristic style of southern Italy and Sicily.\r\n\r\nTHE IONIC COLUMN.\r\n\r\nThe Ionic column rests upon a base. Its shaft is tall and slender. The\r\nbeautifully carved capital swells outward into two spiral rolls, the ends\r\nof which are curled under to form the \"volutes.\" The Ionic order\r\nflourished particularly in Asia Minor. It was well known, too, at Athens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPITALS\r\nThe highly decorative Corinthian capital, modeled on acanthus leaves, came\r\ninto fashion in Alexandrian and Roman times. The Composite capital, as its\r\nname indicates, combined details from the Ionic and Corinthian into one\r\nornate whole. This and the plain Tuscan capital were quite generally\r\nemployed by the Romans.]\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE GREEK TEMPLE\r\n\r\nThe temple formed the chief structure in a Greek city. It was very simple\r\nin outline--merely a rectangular building provided with doors, but without\r\nwindows. Around it was a single or a double row of columns. Above them\r\nrose the architrave, a plain band of massive stones which reached from one\r\ncolumn to another. Then came the frieze, adorned with sculptured reliefs,\r\nthen the horizontal cornice, and at the ends of the building the\r\ntriangular pediments formed by the sloping roof. The pediments were\r\nsometimes decorated with statues. Since the temple was not intended to\r\nhold a congregation of worshipers, but only to contain the image of the\r\ngod, the interior usually had little ornamentation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PARTHENON\r\n  RESTORATION\r\n  PRESENT CONDITION\r\nAfter serving as a temple for about nine centuries the Parthenon was\r\nturned into a Christian church and later into a Mohammedan mosque. In 1687\r\nA.D. the Venetians bombarded Athens and sent a shell into the center of\r\nthe building which the Turks had used as a powder magazine. The result was\r\nan explosion that threw down the side walls and many of the columns.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURES FROM THE PEDIMENT OF THE PARTHENON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM THE PARTHENON FRIEZE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORNER OF THE PARTHENON (RESTORED)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARYATID PORCH OF THE ERECHTHEUM]\r\n\r\nUNIQUENESS OF THE GREEK TEMPLE\r\n\r\nGreek temples were not very large, for hugeness was no object to the\r\nbuilders. They were not even lavishly decorated. Their beauty lies, most\r\nof all, in their harmonious proportions and perfect symmetry. In the best\r\nexamples of the Greek temple there are, for instance, no straight lines.\r\nThe columns are not set at equal intervals, but closer together near the\r\ncorners of the building. The shafts of the columns, instead of tapering\r\nupward at a uniform rate, swell slightly toward the center. The artistic\r\neyes of the Greeks delighted in such subtle curves. These characteristics\r\nmake a classical temple unique of its kind. [31]\r\n\r\n\r\n98. GREEK SCULPTURE\r\n\r\nTHE GREEK GENIUS IN SCULPTURE\r\n\r\nThe greatest achievement of the Greeks in art was their sculpture. Roman\r\nartists surpassed them in the creation of massive architectural works;\r\nmodern artists have surpassed them in painting. In sculpture the Greeks\r\nstill remain unexcelled.\r\n\r\nLOSS OF THE MASTERPIECES\r\n\r\nThe existing remains of Greek sculpture are very scanty. The statues of\r\ngold and ivory vanished long ago. The bronze statues, formerly numbered by\r\nthousands, have nearly all gone into the melting pot. Sculptures in marble\r\nwere turned into mortar or used as building materials. Those which escaped\r\nsuch a fate were often ruined by wanton mutilation and centuries of\r\nneglect. The statues which we still possess are mainly marble copies, made\r\nin Roman times from Greek originals. It is as if the paintings by the old\r\nmasters of Europe, four centuries ago, were now known only in the\r\nreproductions by modern artists of inferior powers.\r\n\r\nMATERIALS\r\n\r\nThe Greek sculptor worked with a variety of materials. Wood was in common\r\nuse during primitive times. Terra cotta was employed at all periods for\r\nstatuettes a few inches in height. Productions in gold and ivory, from the\r\ncostliness of these objects, were extremely rare. Bronze was the favorite\r\nmaterial of some of the most eminent artists. The Greek sculptor\r\nespecially relied on the beautiful marbles in which his country abounded.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL PROCESSES\r\n\r\nThe methods employed by the ancient sculptor differed in some respects\r\nfrom those followed by his modern successors. A Greek marble statue was\r\nusually built up out of several parts. The joining was accomplished with\r\nsuch skill as to escape ordinary observation. The preliminary work of\r\nhewing out from the rough was done by means of chisels. The surface of the\r\nmarble afterwards received a careful polishing with the file, and also\r\nwith sand. Marble statues were always more or less painted. The coloring\r\nseems to have been done sparingly, being applied, as a rule, only to the\r\nfeatures and draperies. Still, it is worth while to remember that the pure\r\nwhite statues of modern sculptors would not have satisfied Greek artists\r\nof the classical age.\r\n\r\nVARIETIES OF GREEK SCUPLTURE\r\n\r\nGreek sculpture existed in the two forms of bas-reliefs and statuary in\r\nthe round. Reliefs were chiefly used for temple pediments and friezes, and\r\nalso for the many grave monuments. Statues consisted of the images of the\r\ngods set up in their shrines, the sculptures dedicated as offerings to\r\ndivinities, and the figures of statesmen, generals, and victorious\r\nathletes raised in public places and sanctuaries.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF THE SCULPTOR'S ART\r\n\r\nThis list will show how many were the opportunities which the ancient\r\nsculptor enjoyed. The service of religion created a constant demand for\r\nhis genius. The numerous athletic contests and the daily sports of the\r\ngymnasium gave him a chance to study living models in the handsome,\r\nfinely-shaped bodies of the contestants. With such inspiration it is not\r\nremarkable that sculpture reached so high a development in ancient Greece.\r\n[32]\r\n\r\n\r\n99. ROMAN ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE\r\n\r\nTHE ARCH AND DOME IN ROMAN BUILDINGS\r\n\r\nIn architecture the Romans achieved preëminence. The temples and other\r\npublic works of Greece seem almost insignificant beside the stupendous\r\nedifices raised by Roman genius in every province of the empire. The\r\nability of the Romans to build on so large a scale arose from their use of\r\nvaulted constructions. Knowledge of the round arch passed over from the\r\nOrient to the Etruscans and from them to the Romans. [33] At first the\r\narch was employed mainly for gates, drainage sewers, aqueducts, and\r\nbridges. In imperial times this device was adopted to permit the\r\nconstruction of vast buildings with overarching domes. The principle of\r\nthe dome has inspired some of the finest creations of ancient and modern\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nROMAN USE OF CONCRETE AND RUBBLE\r\n\r\nThe Romans for many of their buildings made much use of concrete. Its\r\nchief ingredient was _pozzolana_, a sand found in great abundance near\r\nRome and other sites. When mixed with lime, it formed a very strong\r\ncement. This material was poured in a fluid state into timber casings,\r\nwhere it quickly set and hardened. Small pieces of stone, called rubble,\r\nwere also forced down into the cement to give it additional stability.\r\nBuildings of this sort were usually faced with brick, which in turn might\r\nbe covered with thin slabs of marble, thus producing an attractive\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nTEMPLES\r\n\r\nThe triumphs of Roman architecture were not confined chiefly to sacred\r\nedifices. Roman temples, indeed, are mostly copies from the Greek. In\r\ncomparison with their originals, they lack grace and refinement. There is\r\nless accuracy in the masonry fitting and far less careful attention to\r\ndetails of construction. A frequent departure from Greek models is found\r\nin the restriction of the rows of pillars to the front of the building,\r\nwhile the sides and rear are lined with \"engaged\" columns to give the idea\r\nof a colonnade. [34] More characteristically Roman are vaulted temples,\r\nsuch as the Pantheon, [35] where the circular dome is faced with a Greek\r\nportico.\r\n\r\nBASILICAS\r\n\r\nRoman basilicas, of which only the ruins are now in existence, were once\r\nfound in every city. These were large, lofty buildings for the use of\r\njudges and merchants. The chief feature of a basilica was the spacious\r\ncentral hall flanked by a single or double row of columns, forming aisles\r\nand supporting the flat roof. At one end of the hall was a semicircular\r\nrecess--the apse--where the judges held court. This arrangement of the\r\ninterior bears a close resemblance to the plan of the early Christian\r\nchurch with its nave, choir (or chancel) and columned aisles. The\r\nChristians, in fact, seem to have taken the familiar basilicas as the\r\nmodels for their places of worship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF THE ULPIAN BASILICA\r\nThe hall measured 360 feet in length and 180 feet in width.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR VIEW OF THE ULPIAN BASILICA (RESTORATION)\r\nBuilt by the Emperor Trajan in connection with his Forum at Rome.]\r\n\r\nAQUEDUCTS\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most imposing, and certainly among the most useful, of Roman\r\nstructures were aqueducts. [36] There were sixty-eight in Italy and the\r\nprovinces. No less than fourteen supplied the capital city with water. The\r\naqueducts usually ran under the surface of the ground, as do our water\r\npipes. They were carried on arches only across depressions and valleys.\r\nThe Claudian aqueduct ran for thirty-six miles underground and for nine\r\nand a half miles on arches. Though these monuments were intended simply as\r\nengineering works, their heavy masses of rough masonry produce an\r\ninspiring sense of power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ROMAN AQUEDUCT\r\nThe Pont du Gard near Nîmes (ancient Nemausus) in southern France. Built\r\nby the emperor Antoninus Pius. The bridge spans two hilltops nearly a\r\nthousand feet apart. It carries an aqueduct with three tiers of massive\r\nstone arches at a height of 160 feet above the stream. This is the finest\r\nand best preserved aqueduct in existence.]\r\n\r\nTHERMAE\r\n\r\nThe abundant water supply furnished by the aqueducts was connected with a\r\nsystem of great public baths, or _thermae_. [37] Scarcely a town or\r\nvillage throughout the empire lacked one or more such buildings. Those at\r\nRome were constructed on a scale of magnificence of which we can form but\r\na slight conception from the ruins now in existence. In addition to many\r\nelaborate arrangements for the bathers, the _thermae_ included lounging\r\nand reading rooms, libraries, gymnasia, and even museums and galleries of\r\nart. The baths, indeed, were splendid clubhouses, open at little or no\r\nexpense to every citizen of the metropolis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COLOSSEUM]\r\n\r\nTRIUMPHAL ARCHES AND COLUMNS\r\n\r\nA very characteristic example of Roman building is found in the triumphal\r\narches. [38] Their sides were adorned with bas-reliefs, which pictured the\r\nprincipal scenes of a successful campaign. Memorial structures, called\r\ncolumns of victory, [39] were also set up in Rome and other cities. Both\r\narch and column have been frequently imitated by modern architects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ROMAN CAMEO\r\nPortrait of a youth cut in sardonyx. Probably of the first century A.D.]\r\n\r\nCIRCUSES, THEATERS, AND AMPHITHEATERS\r\n\r\nThe palaces of Roman emperors and nobles, together with their luxurious\r\ncountry houses, or villas, have all disappeared. A like fate has befallen\r\nthe enormous circuses, such as the Circus Maximus [40] at Rome and the\r\nHippodrome [41] at Constantinople. The Roman theaters that still survive\r\nreproduce, in most respects, the familiar outlines of the Greek\r\nstructures. In the amphitheaters, where animal shows and gladiatorial\r\ncombats were exhibited, we have a genuinely Roman invention. The gigantic\r\nedifice, called the Colosseum, in its way as truly typifies Roman\r\narchitectural genius as the Parthenon represents at its best that of the\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\nROMAN SCULPTURE\r\n\r\nRoman sculpture owed much to Greek models. However, the portrait statues\r\nand bas-reliefs show originality and illustrate the tendency of the Romans\r\ntoward realism in art. The sculptor tried to represent an historic person\r\nas he really looked or an historic event, for example, a battle or a\r\ntriumphal procession, as it actually happened. The portrait statues of\r\nRoman emperors and the bas-reliefs from the arch of Titus impress us at\r\nonce with a sense of their reality.\r\n\r\nWALL PAINTINGS\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of Roman painting is almost wholly confined to the wall\r\npaintings found at Rome, Herculaneum, and Pompeii. What has survived is\r\napparently the work of ordinary craftsmen, who, if not Greeks, were deeply\r\naffected by the Greek spirit. Most of the scenes they depict are taken\r\nfrom classical mythology. The coloring is very rich; and the peculiar\r\nshade of red used is known to-day by the name of \"Pompeian red.\" The\r\npractice of mural painting passed over from the Romans to European\r\nartists, who have employed it in the frescoes of medieval and modern\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\n\r\n100. ARTISTIC ATHENS\r\n\r\nART CENTERS OF ANTIQUITY\r\n\r\nAthens and Rome were the artistic centers of the classical world.\r\nArchitects, sculptors, and painters lavished their finest efforts on the\r\nadornment of these two capitals. Here there are still to be seen some of\r\nthe most beautiful and impressive monuments of antiquity.\r\n\r\nROADS AND SUBURBS OF ATHENS\r\n\r\nAthens lies in the center of the Attic plain, about four miles from the\r\nsea. [42] The city commands a magnificent view of purple-hued mountains\r\nand the shining waters of the Aegean. Roads approached the ancient city\r\nfrom all parts of Attica. Among these were the highway from Piraeus,\r\nrunning between the Long Walls, [43] and the Sacred Way from Eleusis,\r\nwhere the famous mysteries were yearly celebrated. [44] The suburbs of\r\nAthens included the Outer Ceramicus, part of which was used as a national\r\ncemetery, and a pleasure ground and gymnasium on the banks of the\r\nCephissus, called the Academy. Another resort, known as the Lyceum,\r\nbordered the little stream of the Ilissus.\r\n\r\nWALLS OF ATHENS\r\n\r\nThe traveler who passed through these suburbs came at length to the great\r\nwall, nearly five miles in circumference, raised by Themistocles to\r\nsurround the settlement at the foot of the Acropolis. [45] The area\r\nincluded within this wall made up Old Athens. About six centuries after\r\nThemistocles the Roman emperor Hadrian, by building additional\r\nfortifications on the east, brought an extensive quarter, called New\r\nAthens, inside the city limits.\r\n\r\nHILLS OF ATHENS\r\n\r\nThe region within the walls was broken up by a number of rocky eminences\r\nwhich have a prominent place in the topography of Athens. Near the center\r\nthe Acropolis rises more than two hundred feet above the plain, its summit\r\ncrowned with monuments of the Periclean Age. Not far away is the hill\r\ncalled the Areopagus. Here the Council of the Areopagus, a court of\r\njustice in trials for murder, held its deliberations in the open air.\r\nBeyond this height is the hill of the Pnyx. This was the meeting place of\r\nthe Athenian Assembly until the fourth century B.C., when the sessions\r\nwere transferred to the theater of Dionysus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, ATHENS]\r\n\r\nTHE AGORA\r\n\r\nThe business and social center of an ancient city was the agora or market\r\nplace. The Athenian Agora lay in the hollow north of the Areopagus and\r\nAcropolis. The square was shaded by rows of plane trees and lined with\r\ncovered colonnades. In the great days of the city, when the Agora was\r\nfilled with countless altars and shrines, it presented a most varied and\r\nattractive scene.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC BUILDINGS\r\n\r\nNot all the splendid structures in Athens were confined to the Agora and\r\nthe Acropolis. On a slight eminence not far from the Agora, rose the so-\r\ncalled \"Theseum,\" [46] a marble temple in the Doric order. Another famous\r\ntemple, the colossal edifice known as the Olympieum, lay at some distance\r\nfrom the Acropolis on the southeast. Fifteen of the lofty columns with\r\ntheir Corinthian capitals are still standing. The theater of Dionysus [47]\r\nis in a fair state of preservation. Beyond this are the remains of the\r\nOdeum, or \"Hall of Song,\" used for musical contests and declamations. The\r\noriginal building was raised by Pericles, in imitation, it is said, of the\r\ntent of Xerxes. The present ruins are those of the structure erected in\r\nthe second century A.D. by a public-spirited benefactor of Athens.\r\n\r\nTHE ACROPOLIS\r\n\r\nThe adornment of the Acropolis formed perhaps the most memorable\r\nachievement of Pericles. [48] This rocky mount was approached on the\r\nwestern side by a flight of sixty marble steps. To the right of the\r\nstairway rose a small but very beautiful Ionic temple dedicated to Athena.\r\nHaving mounted the steps, the visitor passed through the superb entrance\r\ngate, or Propylaea, which was constructed to resemble the front of a\r\ntemple with columns and pediment. Just beyond the Propylaea stood a great\r\nbronze statue of the Guardian Athena, a masterpiece of the sculptor\r\nPhidias.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ACROPOLIS OF ATHENS (RESTORATION)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ACROPOLIS OF ATHENS FROM THE SOUTHWEST]\r\n\r\nTHE ERECHTHEUM\r\n\r\nThe Erechtheum, a temple which occupies part of the Acropolis, is in the\r\nIonic style. It may be regarded as the best existing example of this light\r\nand graceful order. Perhaps the most interesting feature is the porch of\r\nthe Caryatides, with a marble roof supported by six pillars carved in the\r\nsemblance of maidens. [49] This curious but striking device has been often\r\ncopied by modern architects.\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE OF THE PARTHENON\r\n\r\nThe other temple on the Acropolis is the world-famed edifice known as the\r\nParthenon, the shrine of the Virgin of the Athena. [50] The Parthenon\r\nillustrates the extreme simplicity of a Greek temple. It had no great size\r\nor height and included only two chambers. The rear room stored sacred\r\nvessels and furniture used in worship, state treasure, and the more\r\nvaluable offerings intrusted to the goddess for safekeeping. The second\r\nand larger room contained a colossal gold and ivory statue of Athena, the\r\nwork of Phidias. It faced the eastern entrance so that it might be bathed\r\nin the rays of the rising sun. Apart from the large doors a certain amount\r\nof light reached the interior through the semi-transparent marble tiles of\r\nthe roof. The Doric columns surrounding the building are marvels of fine\r\nworkmanship. The Parthenon, because of its perfection of construction and\r\nadmirable proportions, is justly regarded as a masterpiece of\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF THE PARTHENON\r\nThe larger room (cella) measured exactly one hundred feet in length.]\r\n\r\nSCULPTURES OF THE PARTHENON\r\n\r\nThe Parthenon was also remarkable for its sculptures [51] executed under\r\nthe superintendence of Phidias. The subjects of the pediment sculptures\r\nare taken from the mythic history of Athena. The frieze of the Parthenon\r\nconsists of a series of sculptured slabs, over five hundred feet in\r\nlength. The subject was the procession of the Great Panathenaea, [52] the\r\nprincipal festival in honor of Athena. At this time the sacred robe of the\r\ngoddess, woven anew for each occasion, was brought to adorn her statue.\r\nThe procession is thought of as starting from the western front, where\r\nAthenian youths dash forward on their spirited steeds. Then comes a\r\nbrilliant array of maidens, matrons, soldiers, and luteplayers. Near the\r\ncenter of the eastern front they meet a group of divinities, who are\r\nrepresented as spectators of the imposing scene. This part of the frieze\r\nis still in excellent condition.\r\n\r\nTHE GLORY OF ATHENS\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a splendid group of buildings that rose on the Acropolis\r\nheight. If to-day they have lost much of their glory, we can still\r\nunderstand how they were the precious possession of the Athenians and the\r\nwonder of all the ancient world. \"O shining, violet-crowned city of song,\r\ngreat Athens, bulwark of Hellas, walls divine!\" The words are those of an\r\nold Greek poet, [53] but they are reëchoed by all who have come under the\r\nmagic spell of the literature and art of the Athenian city.\r\n\r\n\r\n101. ARTISTIC ROME\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF ANCIENT ROME\r\n\r\nThe monuments of Rome, unlike those of Athens, cannot lay claim to great\r\nantiquity. The destruction wrought by the Gauls in 390 B.C. and the great\r\nfire under Nero in 64 A.D. removed nearly all traces of the regal and\r\nrepublican city. Many buildings erected in the imperial age have also\r\ndisappeared, because in medieval and modern times the inhabitants of Rome\r\nused the ancient edifices as quarries. The existing monuments give only a\r\nfaint idea of the former magnificence of the capital city.\r\n\r\nHILLS OF ROME\r\n\r\nThe city of Rome lies on the Tiber. Where the river approaches Rome it\r\nmakes two sharp turns, first to the west and then to the east. On the\r\nwestern, or Etruscan, bank stood the two hills called Vatican and\r\nJaniculum. They were higher than the famous seven which rose on the\r\neastern side, where the ancient city was built. Two of these seven hills\r\npossess particular interest. The earliest settlement, as we have seen,\r\n[54] probably occupied the Palatine. It became in later days the favorite\r\nsite for the town houses of Roman nobles. In the imperial age the splendid\r\npalaces of the Caesars were located here. The Capitoline, steepest of the\r\nseven hills, was divided into two peaks. On one of these rose the most\r\nfamous of all Roman temples, dedicated to Jupiter and his companion\r\ndeities, Juno and Minerva. The other peak was occupied by a large temple\r\nof Juno Moneta (\"the Adviser\"), which served as the mint. The altars,\r\nshrines, and statues which once covered this height were so numerous that\r\nthe Capitoline, like the Athenian Acropolis, became a museum of art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, ROME]\r\n\r\nWALLS AND OPEN SPACES\r\n\r\nRome in early times was surrounded by a wall which bore the name of its\r\nlegendary builder, Servius Tullius. The present fortifications were not\r\nconstructed until the reign of the emperor Aurelian. [55] The ancient city\r\nwas closely built up, with only two great open spaces, in addition to the\r\nForum. These were the Circus Maximus, in the hollow between the Palatine\r\nMount and the Aventine, and the Campus Martius, stretching along the Tiber\r\nto the northwest of the Capitoline Hill.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC BUILDINGS\r\n\r\nFollowing the map of ancient Rome under the empire we may note the more\r\nimportant monuments which still exist in something like their original\r\ncondition. Across the Tiber and beyond the Campus Martius stands the\r\nmausoleum of Hadrian. [56] The most notable structure in the Campus\r\nMartius is the Pantheon. [57] It is the one ancient building in the entire\r\nRoman world which still survives, inside and out, in a fair state of\r\npreservation. The depression between the Caelian and Esquiline hills\r\ncontains the Flavian Amphitheater, better known as the Colosseum. [58] It\r\nwas begun by Vespasian and probably completed by Titus. No less than\r\neighty entrances admitted the forty-five thousand spectators who could be\r\naccommodated in this huge structure. Despite the enormous mass of the\r\npresent ruins probably two-thirds of the original materials have been\r\ncarried away to be used in other buildings. Close to the Colosseum stands\r\nthe arch [59] erected by the Senate in honor of the victory of Constantine\r\nover his rival Maxentius. From this event is dated the triumph of\r\nChristianity in the Roman state. The ruins of the huge baths of Caracalla\r\nlie about half a mile from the Colosseum. Near the center of the city are\r\nthe remains of the Forum added by Trajan to the accommodations of the\r\noriginal Forum. It contains the column of Trajan [60] under which that\r\nemperor was buried.\r\n\r\nTHE FORUM\r\n\r\nThe Forum lies in the valley north of the Palatine Hill. It was the\r\nbusiness and social center of the Roman city. During the Middle Ages the\r\nsite was buried in ruins and rubbish, in some places to a depth of forty\r\nfeet or more. Recent excavations have restored the ancient level and\r\nuncovered the remains of the ancient structures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROMAN FORUM AND THE SURROUNDING BUILDINGS (RESTORED)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROMAN FORUM AT THE PRESENT TIME]\r\n\r\nAPPROACH TO THE FORUM\r\n\r\nThe Forum could be approached from the east by one of the most famous\r\nstreets in the world, the Roman Sacred Way. The illustration of the Forum\r\nat the present time gives a view, looking eastward from the Capitoline\r\nMount, and shows several of the buildings on or near the Sacred Way. At\r\nthe left are seen the ruins of the basilica of Constantine. Farther in the\r\ndistance the Colosseum looms up. Directly ahead is the arch of Titus,\r\nwhich commemorates the capture of Jerusalem in 70 A.D. [61] The ruins of\r\nthe palaces of the Caesars occupy the slopes of the Palatine.\r\n\r\nTHE FORUM TO-DAY\r\n\r\nThe only well-preserved monument in the Forum is the beautiful arch\r\nerected by the emperor Septimius Severus. Beyond it are three columns\r\nwhich once formed part of the temple of Castor. They date from the time of\r\nTiberius. In front are the foundations of the Basilica Julia, built by\r\nAugustus. Next come eight Ionic columns, all that remain of the temple of\r\nSaturn. Near it and in the foreground are several columns in the\r\nCorinthian style, belonging to a temple built by Vespasian.\r\n\r\nTHE FORUM IN ANTIQUITY\r\n\r\nThese ruined monuments, these empty foundations and lonely pillars, afford\r\nlittle idea of all the wealth of architecture that once adorned this spot.\r\nHere stood the circular shrine of Vesta, [62] guarding the altar and its\r\never-blazing fire. Here was the temple of Concord, famous in Roman\r\nhistory. [63] The Senate-house was here, and just before it, the Rostra, a\r\nplatform adorned with the beaks (_rostra_) of captured ships. From this\r\nplace Roman orators addressed their assembled fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nTHE GRANDEUR OF ROME\r\n\r\nHow splendid a scene must have greeted an observer in ancient times who,\r\nfrom the height of the Capitol, gazed at the city before him. The Forum\r\nwas then one radiant avenue of temples, triumphal arches, columns, and\r\nshrines. And beyond the Forum stretched a magnificent array of theaters\r\nand amphitheaters, enormous baths, colossal sepulchers, and statues in\r\nstone and bronze. So prodigious an accumulation of objects beautiful,\r\ncostly, and rare has never before or since been found on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n102. THE OSTROGOTHS IN ITALY, 488-553 A.D.\r\n\r\nTRANSITION TO THE MIDDLE AGES\r\n\r\nWe are not to suppose that the settlement of Germans within the Roman\r\nEmpire ended with the deposition of Romulus Augustulus, near the close of\r\nthe fifth century. The following centuries witnessed fresh invasions and\r\nthe establishment of new Germanic states. The study of these troubled\r\ntimes leads us from the classical world to the world of medieval Europe,\r\nfrom the history of antiquity to the history of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nTHE OSTROGOTHS UNDER THEODORIC\r\n\r\nThe kingdom which Odoacer established on Italian soil did not long endure.\r\nIt was soon overthrown by the Ostrogoths. At the time of the \"fall\" of\r\nRome in 476 A.D. they occupied a district south of the middle Danube,\r\nwhich the government at Constantinople had hired them to defend. The\r\nOstrogoths proved to be expensive and dangerous allies. When, therefore,\r\ntheir chieftain, Theodoric, offered to lead his people into Italy and\r\nagainst Odoacer, the Roman emperor gladly sanctioned the undertaking.\r\n\r\nOSTROGOTHIC INVASION OF ITALY, 488-493 A.D.\r\n\r\nTheodoric led the Ostrogoths--women and children as well as warriors--\r\nacross the Alps and came down to meet Odoacer and his soldiers in battle.\r\nAfter suffering several defeats, Odoacer shut himself up in the strong\r\nfortress of Ravenna. Theodoric could not capture the place and at last\r\nagreed to share with Odoacer the government of Italy, if the latter would\r\nsurrender. The agreement was never carried into effect. When Theodoric\r\nentered Ravenna, he invited Odoacer to a great feast and at its conclusion\r\nslew him in cold blood. Theodoric had now no rival in Italy.\r\n\r\nTHEODORIC KING OF ITALY, 493-526 A.D.\r\n\r\nThough Theodoric gained the throne by violence and treachery, he soon\r\nshowed himself to be, as a ruler, wise, broad-minded, and humane. He had\r\nlived as a youth in the imperial court at Constantinople and there had\r\nbecome well acquainted with Roman ideas of law and order. Roman\r\ncivilization impressed him; and he wished not to destroy but to preserve\r\nit. Theodoric reigned in Italy for thirty-three years, and during this\r\ntime the country enjoyed unbroken peace and prosperity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMB OF THEODORIC AT RAVENNA\r\nA two storied marble building erected by Theodoric in imitation of a Roman\r\ntomb. The roof is a single block of marble 33 feet in diameter and\r\nweighing more than 300 tons. Theodoric's body was subsequently removed\r\nfrom its resting place, and the mausoleum was converted into a church.]\r\n\r\nTHEODORIC'S RULE IN ITALY.\r\n\r\nThe enlightened policy of Theodoric was exhibited in many ways. He\r\ngoverned Ostrogoths and Romans with equal consideration. He kept all the\r\nold offices, such as the senatorship and the consulate, and by preference\r\nfilled them with men of Roman birth. His chief counselors were Romans. A\r\nlegal code, which he drew up for the use of Ostrogoths and Romans alike,\r\ncontained only selections from Roman law. He was remarkably tolerant and,\r\nin spite of the fact that the Ostrogoths were Arians, [2] was always ready\r\nto extend protection to Catholic Christians. Theodoric patronized\r\nliterature and gave high positions to Roman writers. He restored the\r\ncities of Italy, had the roads and aqueducts repaired, and so improved the\r\ncondition of agriculture that Italy, from a wheat-importing, became a\r\nwheat-exporting, country. At Ravenna, the Ostrogothic capital, Theodoric\r\nerected many notable buildings, including a palace, a mausoleum, and\r\nseveral churches. The remains of these structures are still to be seen.\r\n\r\nTHEODORIC'S FOREIGN POLICY\r\n\r\nThe influence of Theodoric reached far beyond Italy. He allied himself by\r\nmarriage with most of the Germanic rulers of the West. His second wife was\r\na Frankish foreign princess, his sister was the wife of a Vandal\r\nchieftain, one of his daughters married a king of the Visigoths, and\r\nanother daughter wedded a Burgundian king. Theodoric by these alliances\r\nbrought about friendly relations between the various barbarian peoples. It\r\nseemed, in fact, as if the Roman dominions in the West might again be\r\nunited under a single ruler; as if the Ostrogoths might be the Germanic\r\npeople to carry on the civilizing work of Rome. But no such good fortune\r\nwas in store for Europe.\r\n\r\nEND OF THE OSTROGOTHIC KINGDOM, 553 A.D.\r\n\r\nTheodoric died in 526 A.D. The year after his death, a great emperor,\r\nJustinian, came to the throne at Constantinople. Justinian had no\r\nintention of abandoning to the Ostrogothic Germans the rich provinces of\r\nSicily and Italy. Although the Ostrogoths made a stubborn resistance to\r\nhis armies, in the end they were so completely overcome that they agreed\r\nto withdraw from the Italian peninsula. The feeble remnant of their nation\r\nfiled sadly through the passes of the Alps and, mingling with other\r\nbarbarian tribes, disappeared from history.\r\n\r\n\r\n103. THE LOMBARDS IN ITALY, 568-774 A.D.\r\n\r\nINVASION OF ITALY BY THE LOMBARDS\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the Ostrogothic kingdom did not free Italy of the\r\nGermans. Soon after Justinian's death the country was again overrun, this\r\ntime by the Lombards. The name of these invaders (in Latin, _Langobardi_)\r\nmay have been derived from the long beards that gave them such a ferocious\r\naspect. The Lombards were the last of the Germanic peoples to quit their\r\nnorthern wilderness and seek new homes in sunny Italy. They seized the\r\nterritory north of the river Po--a region ever since known as Lombardy--\r\nand established their capital at Pavia. The Lombards afterwards made many\r\nsettlements in central and southern Italy, but never succeeded in subduing\r\nthe entire peninsula.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, EUROPE IN THE SIXTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\nLOMBARD RULE IN ITALY\r\n\r\nThe rule of the Lombards at first bore hardly on Italy, which they treated\r\nas a conquered land. In character they seem to been far less attractive\r\nthan their predecessors the Visigoths and Ostrogoths. Many of them were\r\nstill heathen when they entered Italy and others were converts to the\r\nArian [3] form of Christianity. In course of time, however, the Lombards\r\naccepted Roman Catholicism and adopted the customs of their subjects. They\r\neven forgot their Germanic language and learned to speak Latin. The\r\nLombard kingdom lasted over two centuries, until it was overthrown by the\r\nFranks. [4]\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF THE LOMBARD INVASION\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Lombards to conquer all Italy had important results in\r\nlater history. Sicily and the extreme southern part of the Italian\r\npeninsula, besides large districts containing the cities of Naples, Rome,\r\nGenoa, Venice, and Ravenna, continued to belong to the Roman Empire in the\r\nEast. The rulers at Constantinople could not exercise effective control\r\nover their Italian possessions, now that these were separated from one\r\nanother by the Lombard territories. The consequence was that Italy broke\r\nup into a number of small and practically independent states, which never\r\ncombined into one kingdom until our own time. The ideal of a united Italy\r\nwaited thirteen hundred years for its realization. [5]\r\n\r\n\r\n104. THE FRANKS UNDER CLOVIS AND HIS SUCCESSORS\r\n\r\nCLOVIS, KING OF THE FRANKS, 481-511 A.D.\r\n\r\nWe have already met the Franks in their home on the lower Rhine, from\r\nwhich they pushed gradually into Roman territory. [6] In 486 A.D., just\r\nten years after the deposition of Romulus Augustulus, the Franks went\r\nforth to conquer under Clovis, [7] one of their chieftains. By overcoming\r\nthe governor of Roman Gaul, in a battle near Soissons, Clovis destroyed\r\nthe last vestige of imperial rule in the West and extended the Frankish\r\ndominions to the river Loire. Clovis then turned against his German\r\nneighbors. East of the Franks, in the region now known as Alsace, lived\r\nthe Alamanni, a people whose name still survives in the French name of\r\nGermany. [8] The Alamanni were defeated in a great battle near Strassburg\r\n(496 A.D.), and much of their territory was added to that of the Franks.\r\nClovis subsequently conquered the Visigothic possessions between the Loire\r\nand the Pyrenees, and compelled the Burgundians to pay tribute. Thus\r\nClovis made himself supreme over nearly the whole of Gaul and even\r\nextended his authority to the other side of the Rhine. This great work\r\nentitles him to be called the founder of the French nation.\r\n\r\nTHE FRANKS AND THE GALLO-ROMANS\r\n\r\nClovis reigned in western Europe as an independent king, but he\r\nacknowledged a sort of allegiance to the Roman emperor by accepting the\r\ntitle of honorary consul. Henceforth to the Gallo-Romans he represented\r\nthe distant ruler at Constantinople. The Roman inhabitants of Gaul were\r\nnot oppressed; their cities were preserved; and their language and laws\r\nwere undisturbed. Clovis, as a statesman, may be compared with his eminent\r\ncontemporary, Theodoric the Ostrogoth.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIANIZATION OF THE FRANKS, 496 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Franks were still a heathen people, when they began their career of\r\nconquest. Clovis, however, had married a Burgundian princess, Clotilda,\r\nwho was a devout Catholic and an ardent advocate of Christianity. The\r\nstory is told how, when Clovis was hard-pressed by the Alamanni at the\r\nbattle of Strassburg, he vowed that if Clotilda's God gave him victory he\r\nwould become a Christian. The Franks won, and Clovis, faithful to his vow,\r\nhad himself baptized by St. Remi, bishop of Reims. \"Bow down thy head,\"\r\nspoke the bishop, as the Frankish king approached the font, \"adore what\r\nthou hast burned, burn what thou has adored.\" [9] With Clovis were\r\nbaptized on that same day three thousand of his warriors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, GROWTH OF THE FRANKISH DOMINIONS, 481-768 A.D.]\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE OF CLOVIS'S CONVERSION\r\n\r\nThe conversion of Clovis was an event of the first importance. He and his\r\nFranks naturally embraced the orthodox Catholic faith, which was that of\r\nhis wife, instead of the Arian form of Christianity, which had been\r\naccepted by almost all the other Germanic invaders. Thus, by what seems\r\nthe merest accident, Catholicism, instead of Arianism, became the religion\r\nof a large part of western Europe. More than this, the conversion of\r\nClovis gained for the Frankish king and his successors the support of\r\nconversion the Roman Church. The friendship between the popes and the\r\nFranks afterwards ripened into a close alliance which greatly influenced\r\nEuropean history.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLIER MEROVINGIAN KINGS\r\n\r\nThe descendants of Clovis are called Merovingians. [10] They occupied the\r\nthrone of the Franks for nearly two hundred and fifty years. The annals of\r\ntheir reigns form an unpleasant catalogue of bloody wars, horrible\r\nmurders, and deeds of treachery without number. Nevertheless, the earlier\r\nMerovingians were strong men, under whose direction the Frankish territory\r\ncontinued to expand, until it included nearly all of what is now France,\r\nBelgium, and Holland, besides a considerable part of Germany.\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF THE FRANKISH CONQUESTS\r\n\r\nThe Frankish conquests differed in two important respects from those of\r\nthe other Germanic peoples. In the first place, the Franks did not cut\r\nthemselves off completely from their original homes. They kept permanently\r\ntheir territory in Germany, drawing from it continual reinforcements of\r\nfresh German blood. In the second place, the Franks steadily added new\r\nGerman lands to their possessions. They built up in this way what was the\r\nlargest and the most permanent of all the barbarian states founded on the\r\nruins of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n105. THE FRANKS UNDER CHARLES MARTEL AND PEPIN THE SHORT\r\n\r\nTHE LATER MEROVINGIAN KINGS\r\n\r\nAfter the middle of the seventh century the Frankish rulers, worn out by\r\nviolence and excesses, degenerated into weaklings, who reigned but did not\r\nrule. The actual management of the state passed into the hands of\r\nofficers, called \"mayors of the palace.\" They left to the kings little\r\nmore than their title, their long hair,--the badge of royalty among the\r\nFranks,--and a scanty allowance for their support. The later Merovingians,\r\naccordingly, are often known as the \"do-nothing kings.\"\r\n\r\nCHARLES MARTEL\r\n\r\nThe most illustrious of these mayors was Charles, surnamed Martel, \"the\r\nHammer,\" from the terrible defeat which he administered to the Mohammedans\r\nnear Tours, in central France. [11] Charles Martel was virtually a king,\r\nbut he never ventured to set aside the Merovingian ruler and himself\r\nascend the throne. This step was taken, however, by Charles's son, Pepin\r\nthe Short.\r\n\r\nPEPIN THE SHORT BECOMES KING OF THE FRANKS, 751 A.D.\r\n\r\nBefore dethroning the last feeble \"do-nothing,\" Pepin sought the approval\r\nof the bishop of Rome. The pope, without hesitation, declared that it was\r\nonly right that the man who had the real authority in the state should\r\nhave the royal title also. Pepin, accordingly, caused himself to be\r\ncrowned king of the Franks, thus founding the Carolingian [12] dynasty.\r\n(751 A.D.). Three years later Pope Stephen II came to Pepin's court and\r\nsolemnly anointed the new ruler with holy oil, in accordance with ancient\r\nJewish custom. The rite of anointing, something unknown to the Germans,\r\ngave to Pepin's coronation the sanction of the Roman Church. Henceforth\r\nthe Frankish sovereigns called themselves \"kings by the grade of God.\"\r\n\r\n\"DONATION OF PEPIN,\" 756 A.D.\r\n\r\nPepin was soon able to repay his great obligation to the Roman Church by\r\nbecoming its protector against the Lombards. These barbarians, who were\r\ntrying to extend their rule in Italy, threatened to capture Rome and the\r\nterritory in the vicinity of that city, then under the control of the\r\npope. Pepin twice entered Italy with his army, defeated the Lombards, and\r\nforced them to cede to Pope Stephen an extensive district lying between\r\nRome and Ravenna. Pepin might have returned this district to the emperor\r\nat Constantinople, to whom it belonged, but the Frankish king declared\r\nthat he had not fought for the advantage of any man but for the welfare of\r\nhis own soul. He decided, therefore, to bestow his conquests on St.\r\nPeter's representative, the pope. Before this time the bishops of Rome had\r\nowned much land in Italy and had acted as virtual sovereigns in Rome and\r\nits neighborhood. Pepin's gift, known as the \"Donation of Pepin,\" greatly\r\nincreased their possessions, which came to be called the States of the\r\nChurch. They remained in the hands of the popes until late in the\r\nnineteenth century. [13]\r\n\r\n\r\n106. THE REIGN OF CHARLEMAGNE, 768-814 A.D.\r\n\r\nCHARLEMAGNE THE MAN\r\n\r\nPepin was succeeded in 768 A.D. by his two sons, one of whom, Charlemagne,\r\nthree years later became sole king of the Franks. Charlemagne reigned for\r\nnearly half a century, and during this time he set his stamp on all later\r\nEuropean history. His character and personality are familiar to us from a\r\nbrief biography, written by his secretary, Einhard. Charlemagne, we learn,\r\nwas a tall, square-shouldered, strongly built man, with bright, keen eyes,\r\nand an expression at once cheerful and dignified. Riding, hunting, and\r\nswimming were his favorite sports. He was simple in his tastes and very\r\ntemperate in both food and drink. Except when in Rome, he wore the old\r\nFrankish costume, with high-laced boots, linen tunic, blue cloak, and\r\nsword girt at his side. He was a clear, fluent speaker, used Latin as\r\nreadily as his native tongue, and understood Greek when it was spoken. \"He\r\nalso tried to learn to write and often kept his tablets and writing book\r\nunder the pillow of his couch, that, when he had leisure, he might\r\npractice his hand in forming letters; but he made little progress in this\r\ntask, too long deferred and begun too late in life.\" [14] For the times,\r\nhowever, Charlemagne was a well-educated man--by no means a barbarian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLEMAGNE (Lateran Museum, Rome)\r\nA mosaic picture, made during the lifetime of Charlemagne and probably a\r\nfair likeness of him.]\r\n\r\nCONQUEST AND CONVERSION OF THE SAXONS, 772-804 A.D.\r\n\r\nMuch of Charlemagne's long life, almost to its close, was filled with\r\nwarfare. He fought chiefly against the still-heathen peoples on the\r\nfrontiers of the Frankish realm. The subjugation of the Saxons, who lived\r\nin the forests and marshes of northwestern Germany, took many years.\r\nCharlemagne at the head of a great army would invade their territory, beat\r\nthem in battle, and receive their submission, only to find his work undone\r\nby a sudden rising of the liberty-loving natives, after the withdrawal of\r\nthe Franks. Once when Charlemagne was exasperated by a fresh revolt, he\r\nordered forty-five hundred prisoners to be executed. This savage massacre\r\nwas followed by equally severe laws, which threatened with death all\r\nSaxons who refused baptism or observed the old heathen rites. By such\r\nharsh means Charlemagne at length broke down the spirit of resistance\r\namong the people. All Saxony, from the Rhine to the Elbe, became a\r\nChristian land and a permanent part of the Frankish realm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE IRON CROWN OF LOMBARDY\r\nA fillet of iron, which, according to pious legend, had been beaten out of\r\none of the nails of the True Cross. It came to the Lombards as a gift from\r\nPope Gregory I. as a reward for their conversion to Roman Catholicism.\r\nDuring the Middle Ages it was used to crown the German emperors kings of\r\nItaly. This precious relic is now kept in a church at Monza in northern\r\nItaly.]\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF THE LOMBARDS, 774 A.D.\r\n\r\nShortly after the beginning of the Saxon wars the king of the Franks\r\nreceived an urgent summons from the pope, who was again being threatened\r\nby his old enemies, the Lombards. Charlemagne led a mighty host across the\r\nAlps, captured Pavia, where the Lombard ruler had taken refuge, and added\r\nhis possessions to those of the Franks. Thus passed away one more of the\r\nGermanic states which had arisen on the ruins of the Roman Empire.\r\nCharlemagne now placed on his own head the famous \"Iron Crown,\" and\r\nassumed the title of \"King of the Franks and Lombards, and Patrician of\r\nthe Romans.\"\r\n\r\nCHARLEMAGNE'S OTHER CONQUESTS\r\n\r\nCharlemagne's conquests were not confined to Germanic peoples. He forced\r\nthe wild Avars, who had advanced from the Caspian into the Danube valley,\r\nto acknowledge his supremacy. He compelled various Slavic tribes,\r\nincluding the Bohemians, to pay tribute. He also invaded Spain and wrested\r\nfrom the Moslems the district between the Ebro River and the Pyrenees. By\r\nthis last conquest Charlemagne may be said to have begun the recovery of\r\nthe Spanish peninsula from Mohammedan rule. [15]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, EUROPE In the Age of Charlemagne, 800 A.D.]\r\n\r\nCHARLEMAGNE'S GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nCharlemagne was a statesman, as well as a warrior. He divided his wide\r\ndominions into counties, each one ruled by a count, who was expected to\r\nkeep order and administer justice. The border districts, which lay exposed\r\nto invasion, were organized into \"marks,\" under the military supervision\r\nof counts of the mark, or margraves (marquises). These officials had so\r\nmuch power and lived so far from the royal court that it was necessary for\r\nCharlemagne to appoint special agents, called _missi dominici_ (\"the\r\nlord's messengers\"), to maintain control over them. The _missi_ were\r\nusually sent out in pairs, a layman and a bishop or abbot, in order that\r\nthe one might serve as a check upon the other. They traveled from county\r\nto county, bearing the orders of their royal master and making sure that\r\nthese orders were promptly obeyed. In this way Charlemagne kept well\r\ninformed as to the condition of affairs throughout his kingdom.\r\n\r\nREVIVAL OF LEARNING UNDER CHARLEMAGNE\r\n\r\nCharlemagne made a serious effort to revive classical culture in the West\r\nfrom the low state into which it had fallen during the period of the\r\ninvasions. We still possess a number of laws issued by this Frankish king\r\nfor the promotion of education. He founded schools in the monasteries and\r\ncathedrals, where not only the clergy but also the common people might\r\nreceive some training. He formed his whole court into a palace school, in\r\nwhich learned men from Italy, Spain, and England gave instruction to his\r\nown children and those of his nobles. The king himself often studied with\r\nthem, under the direction of his good friend, Alcuin, an Englishman and\r\nthe foremost scholar in western Europe. He had the manuscripts of Latin\r\nauthors collected and copied, so that the knowledge preserved in books\r\nshould not be forgotten. All this civilizing work, together with the peace\r\nand order which he maintained throughout a wide territory, made his reign\r\nthe most brilliant period of the early Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATHEDRAL AT AIX-LA-CHAPELLE\r\nAix-la-Chapelle (Aachen) was the capital city and favorite residence of\r\nCharlemagne. The church which he built here was almost entirely destroyed\r\nby the Northmen in the tenth century. The octagonal building surmounted by\r\na dome which forms the central part of the present cathedral is a\r\nrestoration of the original structure. The marble columns pavements and\r\nmosaics of Charlemagne's church were brought by him from Ravenna.]\r\n\r\n\r\n107. CHARLEMAGNE AND THE REVIVAL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, 800 A.D.\r\n\r\nCORONATION OF CHARLEMAGNE, 800 A.D.\r\n\r\nCharlemagne, the champion of Christendom and the foremost ruler in Europe,\r\nseemed to the men of his day the rightful successor of the Roman emperors.\r\nHe had their power, and now he was to have their name. In the year 800\r\nA.D. the Frankish king visited Rome to investigate certain accusations\r\nmade against the pope, Leo III, by his enemies in the city. Charlemagne\r\nabsolved Leo of all wrong-doing and restored him to his office.\r\nAfterwards, on Christmas Day Charlemagne went to old St. Peter's Church,\r\nwhere the pope was saying Mass. As the king, dressed in the rich robes of\r\na Roman patrician, knelt in prayer before the high altar, the pope\r\nsuddenly placed on his head a golden crown, while all the people cried out\r\nwith one voice, \"Long life and victory to Charles Augustus, the great and\r\npacific emperor of the Romans, crowned by God!\"\r\n\r\nREASONS FOR THE CORONATION\r\n\r\nAlthough Charlemagne appears to have been surprised by the pope's act, we\r\nknow that he wished to become emperor. The imperial title would confer\r\nupon him greater dignity and honor, though not greater power, than he\r\npossessed as king of the Franks and of the Lombards. The pope, in turn,\r\nwas glad to reward the man who had protected the Church and had done so\r\nmuch to spread the Catholic faith among the heathen. The Roman people also\r\nwelcomed the coronation, because they felt that the time had come for Rome\r\nto assume her old place as the capital of the world. To reject the eastern\r\nruler, in favor of the great Frankish king, was an emphatic method of\r\nasserting Rome's independence of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE CORONATION\r\n\r\nThe coronation of Charlemagne was one of the most important events in\r\nmedieval history. It might be thought a small matter that he should take\r\nthe imperial title, when he already exercised imperial sway throughout\r\nwestern Europe. But Charlemagne's contemporaries believed that the old\r\nRoman Empire had now been revived, and a German king now sat on the throne\r\nonce occupied by Augustus and Constantine. Henceforth there was\r\nestablished in the West a line of Roman emperors which lasted until the\r\nopening of the nineteenth century. [16]\r\n\r\nCHARLEMAGNE'S EMPIRE\r\n\r\nCharlemagne's empire was not in any true sense a continuation of the Roman\r\nEmpire. It did not include the dominions over which the emperors at\r\nConstantinople were to reign for centuries. Moreover, Charlemagne and his\r\nsuccessors on the throne had little in common with the old rulers of Rome,\r\nwho spoke Latin, administered Roman law, and regarded the Germans as among\r\ntheir most dangerous enemies. Charlemagne's empire was, in fact, largely a\r\nnew creation.\r\n\r\n\r\n108. DISRUPTION OF CHARLEMAGNE'S EMPIRE, 814-870 A.D.\r\n\r\nAFTER CHARLEMAGNE\r\n\r\nThe empire of Charlemagne did not long remain intact. So vast was its\r\nextent and so unlike were its inhabitants in race, language, and customs\r\nthat it could be managed only by a ruler of the greatest energy and\r\nstrength of will. Unfortunately, the successors of Charlemagne proved to\r\nbe too weak for the task of maintaining peace and order. Western Europe\r\nnow entered on a long period of confusion and violence, during which\r\nCharlemagne's possessions broke up into separate and warring kingdoms.\r\n\r\nTREATY OF VERDUN, 843 A.D.\r\n\r\nCharlemagne's son, Louis the Pious, who became emperor in 814 A.D., was a\r\nwell-meaning but feeble ruler, better fitted for the quiet life of a\r\nmonastery than for the throne. He could not control his rebellious sons,\r\nwho, even during his lifetime, fought bitterly over their inheritance. The\r\nunnatural strife, which continued after his death, was temporarily settled\r\nby a treaty concluded at the city of Verdun. According to its terms\r\nLothair, the eldest brother, received Italy and the imperial title,\r\ntogether with a narrow stretch of land along the valleys of the Rhine and\r\nthe Rhone, between the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Louis and Charles,\r\nthe other brothers, received kingdoms lying to the east and west,\r\nrespectively, of Lothair's territory. The Treaty of Verdun may be said to\r\nmark the first stage in the dissolution of the Carolingian Empire.\r\n\r\nTREATY OF MERSEN, 870 A.D.\r\n\r\nA second treaty, made at Mersen in Holland, was entered into by Louis and\r\nCharles, after the death of their brother Lothair. They divided between\r\nthemselves Lothair's kingdom north of the Alps, leaving to his young son\r\nthe possession of Italy and the empty title of \"emperor.\" The Treaty of\r\nMersen may be said to mark the second stage in the dissolution of the\r\nCarolingian Empire. That empire, as such, had now ceased to exist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, THE FRANKISH DOMINIONS AS DIVIDED BY THE TREATIES OF\r\nVERDUN (843 A.D.) AND MERSEN (870 A.D.)]\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF THE TWO TREATIES\r\n\r\nThe territorial arrangements made by the treaties of Verdun and Mersen\r\nforeshadowed the future map of western Europe. The East Frankish kingdom\r\nof Louis, inhabited almost entirely by Germanic peoples, was to develop\r\ninto modern Germany. The West Frankish kingdom of Charles, inhabited\r\nmainly by descendants of Romanized Gauls, was to become modern France.\r\nLothair's kingdom, separated into two parts by the Alps, never became a\r\nnational state. Italy, indeed, might be united under one government, but\r\nthe long, narrow strip north of the Alps had no unity of race, no common\r\nlanguage, and no national boundaries. It was fated to be broken into\r\nfragments and to be fought over for centuries by its stronger neighbors.\r\nPart of this territory now forms the small countries of Belgium, Holland,\r\nand Switzerland, and another part, known as Alsace and Lorraine, [17]\r\nstill remains a bone of contention between France and Germany.\r\n\r\nRENEWED BARBARIAN INVASIONS\r\n\r\nEven had Charlemagne been followed by strong and able rulers, it would\r\nhave been a difficult matter to hold the empire together in the face of\r\nthe fresh series of barbarian inroads which began immediately after his\r\ndeath. The Mohammedans, though checked by the Franks at the battle of\r\nTours, [18] continued to be dangerous enemies. They ravaged southern\r\nFrance, Sicily, and parts of Italy. The piratical Northmen from Denmark\r\nand Norway harried the coast of France and made inroads far beyond Paris.\r\nThey also penetrated into western Germany, sailing up the Rhine in their\r\nblack ships and destroying such important towns as Cologne and Aix-la-\r\nChapelle. Meanwhile, eastern Germany lay exposed to the attacks of the\r\nSlavs, whom Charlemagne had defeated but not subdued. The Magyars, or\r\nHungarians, were also dreaded foes. Their wild horsemen entered Europe\r\nfrom the plains of Asia and, like the Huns and Avars to whom they were\r\nprobably related, spread devastation far and wide. A great part of Europe\r\nthus suffered from invasions almost as destructive as those which had\r\nbrought ruin to the old Roman world.\r\n\r\n\r\n109. GERMANY UNDER THE SAXON KINGS, 919-973 A.D.\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN STEM-DUCHIES\r\n\r\nThe tenth century saw another movement toward the restoration of law and\r\norder. The civilizing work of Charlemagne was taken up by German kings,\r\nnot of the old Prankish stock, but belonging to that Saxon people which\r\nhad opposed Charlemagne so long and bitterly. Saxony was one of the five\r\ngreat territorial states, or stem-duchies, as they are usually called,\r\ninto which Germany was then divided. [19] Germany at that time extended\r\nonly as far east as the river Elbe, beyond which lay the territory\r\noccupied by half-civilized Slavic tribes.\r\n\r\nELECTIVE KINGSHIP OF GERMANY\r\n\r\nThe rulers of the stem-duchies enjoyed practical independence, though they\r\nhad recognized some king of Germany ever since the Treaty of Verdun. Early\r\nin the tenth century the Carolingian dynasty died out in Germany, and the\r\nGerman nobles then proceeded to elect their own kings. Their choice fell\r\nfirst upon Conrad, duke of Franconia, but he had little authority outside\r\nhis own duchy. A stronger man was required to keep the peace among the\r\nturbulent nobles and to repel the invaders of Germany. Such a man appeared\r\nin the person of Henry, duke of Saxony, who, after Conrad's death, was\r\nchosen king.\r\n\r\nREIGN OF HENRY THE FOWLER, 919-936 A.D.\r\n\r\nHenry I, called the Fowler, because he was fond of hunting birds, spent\r\nthe greater part of his reign in wars against the Slavs, Magyars, and\r\nother invaders. He conquered from the Slavs the territory afterwards known\r\nas Brandenburg. This country was to furnish Germany, in later centuries,\r\nwith its present dynasty--the Hohenzollerns. [20] He occupied the southern\r\npart of Denmark (Schleswig) and Christianized it. He also recovered for\r\nGermany Lorraine, a district which remained in German hands until the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\nREIGN OF OTTO THE GREAT, 936-973 A.D.\r\n\r\nHenry the Fowler was succeeded by his son, Otto I, whom history knows as\r\nOtto the Great. He well deserved the title. Like Charlemagne, Otto\r\npresented the aspect of a born ruler. He is described as being tall and\r\ncommanding in presence, strong and vigorous of body, and gifted with great\r\ncharm of manner. In his bronzed face shone clear and sparkling eyes, and\r\ndown his breast hung a long, thick beard. Though subject to violent\r\noutbursts of temper, he was liberal to his friends and just to his foes.\r\nOtto was a man of immense energy and ambition, with a high conception of\r\nhis duties as a sovereign. His reign forms one of the most notable epochs\r\nin German history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RING SEAL OF OTTO THE GREAT\r\nThe inscription reads _Oddo Rex_.]\r\n\r\nOTTO AND THE MAGYARS\r\n\r\nOtto continued Henry's work of defending Germany from the foes which\r\nthreatened to overrun that country. He won his most conspicuous success\r\nagainst the Magyars, who suffered a crushing defeat on the banks of the\r\nriver Lech in Bavaria (955 A.D.). These barbarians now ceased their raids\r\nand retired to the lands on the middle Danube which they had seized from\r\nthe Slavs. Here they settled down, accepted Christianity from the Roman\r\nChurch, and laid the foundations of the kingdom of Hungary. [21] As a\r\nprotection against future Magyar inroads Otto established the East Mark.\r\nThis region afterwards rose to great importance under the name of Austria.\r\n\r\nOTTO AND THE STEM-DUKES\r\n\r\nOtto was an excellent ruler of Germany. He made it his business to\r\nstrengthen the royal authority by weakening that of the stem-dukes. He had\r\nto fight against them on more than one occasion, for they regarded\r\nthemselves almost as independent kings. Otto was able to keep them in\r\ncheck, but the rulers who followed him were less successful in this\r\nrespect. The struggle between the kings and their powerful nobles formed a\r\nconstant feature of the medieval history of Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n110. OTTO THE GREAT AND THE RESTORATION OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, 962 A.D.\r\n\r\nCONDITION OF ITALY\r\n\r\nOtto the Great is not to be remembered only as a German king. His reign\r\nwas also noteworthy in the history of Italy. The country at this time was\r\nhopelessly divided between rival and contending peoples. The emperor at\r\nConstantinople controlled the southern extremity of the peninsula. The\r\nMohammedans held Sicily and some cities on the mainland. The pope ruled at\r\nRome and in the States of the Church. A so-called king of Italy still\r\nreigned in Lombardy, but he could not manage the powerful counts, dukes,\r\nand marquises, who were virtually independent within their own domains.\r\nEven the imperial title died out, and now there was no longer a Roman\r\nemperor in the West.\r\n\r\nCORONATION OF OTTO THE GREAT, 962 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe deplorable condition of Italy invited interference from abroad.\r\nFollowing in the footsteps of Charlemagne, Otto the Great led two\r\nexpeditions across the Alps, assumed the \"Iron Crown\" [22] of Lombardy,\r\nand then proceeded to Rome, where he secured the pope (John XII) against\r\nthe latter's enemies in that city. Otto's reward was the same as\r\nCharlemagne's. On Candlemas Day, (February 2d) 962 A.D., the grateful pope\r\ncrowned him Roman emperor.\r\n\r\nMEANING OF THE CORONATION\r\n\r\nThe coronation of Otto the Great seemed to his contemporaries a necessary\r\nand beneficial act. They still believed that the Roman Empire was\r\nsuspended, not extinct; and that now, one hundred and fifty years after\r\nCharlemagne, the occasion was opportune to revive the name and power\r\nassociated with the golden age of the first Frankish emperor. Otto's\r\nardent spirit, one may well believe, was fired with this vision of\r\nimperial sway and the renewal of a title around which clustered so many\r\nmemories of success and glory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, EUROPE IN THE AGE OF OTTO THE GREAT, 962 A.D.]\r\n\r\nULTIMATE RESULTS OF THE CORONATION\r\n\r\nBut the outcome of Otto's restoration of the Roman Empire was good neither\r\nfor Italy nor for Germany. It became the rule, henceforth, that the man\r\nwhom the German nobles chose as their king had a claim, also, to the\r\nItalian crown and the imperial title. The efforts of the German kings to\r\nmake good this claim led to their constant interference in the affairs of\r\nItaly. They treated that country as a conquered province which had no\r\nright to a national life and an independent government under its own\r\nrulers. At the same time they neglected Germany and failed to keep their\r\npowerful territorial lords in subjection. Neither Italy nor Germany, in\r\nconsequence, could become a unified, centralized state, such as was formed\r\nin France and England during the later Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nTHE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\nThe empire of Charlemagne, restored by Otto the Great, came to be called\r\nin later centuries the \"Holy Roman Empire.\" The title points to the idea\r\nof a world monarchy--the Roman Empire--and a world religion--Roman\r\nChristianity--united in one institution. This magnificent idea was never\r\nfully realized. The popes and emperors, instead of being bound to each\r\nother by the closest ties, were more generally enemies than friends. A\r\nlarge part of medieval history was to turn on this conflict between the\r\nEmpire and the Papacy. [23]\r\n\r\n\r\n111. THE ANGLO-SAXONS IN BRITAIN, 449-839 A.D.\r\n\r\nANGLO-SAXON CONQUEST OF BRITAIN\r\n\r\nFrom the history of Continental Europe we now turn to the history of\r\nBritain. That island had been overrun by the Germanic barbarians after the\r\nmiddle of the fifth century. [24] They are commonly known as Anglo-Saxons,\r\nfrom the names of their two principal peoples, the Angles and Saxons. The\r\nAnglo-Saxon conquest of Britain was a slow process, which lasted at least\r\none hundred and fifty years. The invaders followed the rivers into the\r\ninterior and gradually subdued more than a half of what is now England,\r\ncomprising the fertile plain district in the southern and eastern parts of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE CONQUEST\r\n\r\nThough the Anglo-Saxons probably destroyed many flourishing cities and\r\ntowns of the Romanized Britons, it seems likely that the conquerors spared\r\nthe women, with whom they intermarried, and the agricultural laborers,\r\nwhom they made slaves. Other natives took refuge in the hill regions of\r\nwestern and northern Britain, and here their descendants still keep up the\r\nCeltic language and traditions. The Anglo-Saxons regarded the Britons with\r\ncontempt, naming them Welsh, a word which means one who talks gibberish.\r\nThe antagonism between the two peoples died out in the course of\r\ncenturies, conquerors and conquered intermingled, and an English nation,\r\npartly Celtic and partly Germanic, came into being.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANGLO-SAXON DRINKING HORN\r\nHorn of Ulphus (Wulf) in the cathedral of York. The old English were heavy\r\ndrinkers chiefly of ale and mead. The evening meal usually ended with a\r\ndrinking bout.]\r\n\r\nTHE SEVEN KINGDOMS IN BRITAIN\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxons started to fight one another before they ceased fighting\r\ntheir common enemy, the Britons. Throughout the seventh and eighth\r\ncenturies, the Anglo-Saxon states were engaged in almost constant\r\nstruggles, either for increase of territory or for supremacy. The kingdoms\r\nfarthest east--Kent, Sussex, Essex, and East Anglia--found their expansion\r\nchecked by other kingdoms--Northumbria, Mercia, and Wessex--which grew up\r\nin the interior of the island. Each of these three stronger states gained\r\nin turn the leading place.\r\n\r\nEGBERT AND THE SUPREMACY OF WESSEX, 802-839 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the supremacy of Wessex dates from the reign of Egbert.\r\nHe had lived for some years as an exile at the court of Charlemagne, from\r\nwhom he must have learned valuable lessons of war and statesmanship. After\r\nreturning from the Continent, Egbert became king of Wessex and gradually\r\nforced the rulers of the other states to acknowledge him as overlord.\r\nThough Egbert was never directly king of all England, he began the work of\r\nuniting the Anglo-Saxons under one government. His descendants have\r\noccupied the English throne to the present day.\r\n\r\nANGLO-SAXON BRITAIN\r\n\r\nWhen the Germans along the Rhine and the Danube crossed the frontiers and\r\nentered the western provinces, they had already been partially Romanized.\r\nThey understood enough of Roman civilization to appreciate it and to\r\ndesire to preserve it. The situation was quite different with the Anglo-\r\nSaxons. Their original home lay in a part of Germany far beyond the\r\nborders of the Roman Empire and remote from the cultural influences of\r\nRome. Coming to Britain as barbarians, they naturally introduced their own\r\nlanguage, laws, and customs wherever they settled. Much of what the Anglo-\r\nSaxons brought with them still lives in England, and from that country has\r\nspread to the United States and the vast English colonies beyond the seas.\r\nThe English language is less indebted to Latin than any of the Romance\r\nlanguages, [25] and the Common law of England owes much less to Roman law\r\nthan do the legal systems of Continental Europe. England, indeed, looks to\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons for some of the most characteristic and important\r\nelements of her civilization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, ANGLO-SAXON BRITAIN]\r\n\r\n\r\n112. CHRISTIANITY IN THE BRITISH ISLES\r\n\r\nPREPARATION FOR CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxons also brought to Britain their heathen faith. Christianity\r\ndid not come to them until the close the sixth century. At this time more\r\nor less intercourse had sprung up between the people of Kent, lying\r\nnearest to the Continent, and the Franks in Gaul. Ethelbert, the king of\r\nKent, had even married the Frankish princess, Bertha. He allowed his\r\nChristian wife to bring a bishop to her new home and gave her the deserted\r\nchurch of St. Martin at Canterbury as a place of worship. Queen Bertha's\r\nfervent desire for the conversion of her husband and his people prepared\r\nthe way for an event of first importance in English history--the mission\r\nof Augustine.\r\n\r\nMISSION OF AUGUSTINE, 597 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe pope at this time was Gregory I, better known, from his services to\r\nthe Roman Church, as Gregory the Great. [26] The kingdom of Kent, with its\r\nChristian queen, must have seemed to him a promising field for missionary\r\nenterprise. Gregory, accordingly, sent out the monk Augustine with forty\r\ncompanions to carry the Gospel to the heathen English. The king of Kent,\r\nalready well disposed toward the Christian faith, greeted the missionaries\r\nkindly and told them that they were free to convert whom they would.\r\nBefore long he and his court embraced Christianity, and the people of Kent\r\nsoon followed the royal example. The monks were assigned a residence in\r\nCanterbury, a city which has ever since remained the religious capital of\r\nEngland. From Kent Christianity in its Roman form gradually spread into\r\nthe other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. MARTIN'S CHURCH, CANTERBURY\r\nThe present church, dating from the thirteenth century occupies the site\r\nof a chapel built before the arrival of Augustine, The walls still contain\r\nsome of the Roman bricks used in the original structure. St Martin's\r\nChurch was the scene of the earliest work of Augustine in Canterbury.]\r\n\r\nCELTIC CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nAugustine and his monks were not the first missionaries to Britain. Roman\r\nsoldiers, merchants, and officials had introduced Christianity among the\r\nBritons as early as second century. During the fifth century the famous\r\nSt. Patrick had carried Christianity to the heathen Irish. The Anglo-Saxon\r\ninvasion of Britain drove many Christians to Ireland, and that island in\r\nthe sixth and seventh centuries became a center from which devoted monks\r\nwent forth to labor in western Scotland and northern Britain [27] Here\r\nthey came in contact with the Roman missionaries.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN CELTIC AND ROMAN CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nThe Celtic Christians followed some customs which differed from those\r\nobserved by Roman Christians. They computed the date on which Easter fell\r\naccording to a system unlike that of the Romans. They permitted their\r\npriests to marry; the Romans forbade the practice. Their monks shaved the\r\nfront of the head from ear to ear as a tonsure, while Roman monks shaved\r\nthe top of the head, leaving a \"crown of thorns.\" These differences may\r\nnot seem very important, but they were enough to prevent the cooperation\r\nof Celtic and Roman missionaries for the conversion of the heathen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL\r\nThe choir dates from the twelfth century, the nave, transepts, and central\r\ntower, from the fifteenth century. One of the two towers at the west front\r\nwas built in 1834-1840 A.D. The beautiful stained glass in the windows of\r\nthe choir belongs to the thirteenth century.]\r\n\r\nSYNOD OF WHITBY, 664 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe rivalry between Celtic and Roman Christians was finally settled at a\r\nchurch gathering, or synod, called by the king of Northumbria at Whitby.\r\nThe main controversy at this synod concerned the proper date for Easter.\r\nIn the course of the debate it was asserted that the Roman custom had the\r\nsanction of St. Peter, to whom Christ had intrusted the keys of heaven.\r\nThis statement was enough for the Northumbrian king, who thereupon decided\r\nin favor of the Roman claim, declaring that he would not oppose St. Peter,\r\n\"lest when I come before the gates of the kingdom of heaven, he who holds\r\nthe keys should not open to me.\" [28] The representatives of the Celtic\r\nChurch then withdrew from England, leaving the field clear for Roman\r\nmissionaries.\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH ISLES BECAME ROMAN CATHOLIC\r\n\r\nThe decision of the Synod of Whitby in favor of Rome meant that all\r\nEngland henceforth would recognize the pope's authority in religious\r\nmatters. It remained a Roman Catholic country until the time of the\r\nReformation, nearly nine hundred years later. [29] The Celtic Christians\r\nin Ireland and Scotland also in the course of time became the devoted\r\nchildren of the Roman Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n113. THE FUSION OF GERMANS AND ROMANS\r\n\r\nTHE GERMANIC KINGDOMS\r\n\r\nWe have now followed the fortunes of the Germans for five centuries from\r\nthe end of the Roman Empire in the West. Most of their kingdoms, it has\r\nbeen seen, were not permanent. The Visigothic and Burgundian dominions in\r\nGaul yielded to the Franks, and those of the Visigoths in Spain, to the\r\nMohammedan Arabs. [30] The Vandal possessions in North Africa were\r\nregained by the emperors at Constantinople. [31] The rule of the\r\nOstrogoths in Italy endured for only sixty years and that of the Lombards\r\npassed away after two centuries. The kingdoms established by the Franks\r\nand the Anglo-Saxons alone developed into lasting states.\r\n\r\nHINDRANCES TO THE FUSION OF GERMANS AND ROMANS\r\n\r\nBut even where the Germans did not found permanent kingdoms, they mingled\r\nwith the subject provincials and adopted much of the old Roman\r\ncivilization. The fusion of the two peoples naturally required a long\r\ntime, being scarcely completed before the middle of the tenth century. It\r\nwas hindered, in the first place, by the desire of the Germans to secure\r\nthe lands of the Romans. Wherever the barbarians settled, they\r\nappropriated a large part of the agricultural soil. How much they took\r\nvaried in different countries. The Ostrogoths seem to have seized one-\r\nthird of the land in Italy; the Visigoths, two-thirds of that in Gaul and\r\nSpain; the Anglo-Saxons, perhaps all the tillable soil of Britain. It\r\ncould not but be galling to the Romans to surrender their farms to the\r\nbarbarians. In the second place, the Germans often assessed heavy taxes on\r\nthe Romans, which they themselves refused to pay. Tax-paying seemed to the\r\nGermans a mark of servitude. In the third place, a barrier between the two\r\npeoples arose from the circumstance that each had its particular law. For\r\nseveral centuries following the invasions there was one law for the\r\nRomans--that which they had enjoyed under the empire--and another law for\r\nthe Germans--their old tribal customs. After the Germans had lived for\r\nsome time in contact with the Romans they wrote out their laws in the\r\nLatin language. These \"Laws of the Barbarians\" still survive and throw\r\nmuch light on their early beliefs and manners.\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS FAVORING FUSION\r\n\r\nIn spite of the hindrances to fusion, it seems true that the Germans and\r\nthe Romans felt no great dislike for each other and that, as a rule, they\r\nfreely intermingled. Certain conditions directly favored this result.\r\nFirst, many Germans had found their way within the empire as hired\r\nsoldiers, colonists, and slaves, long before the invasions began. Second,\r\nthe Germanic invaders came in relatively small numbers. Third, the Germans\r\nentered the Roman world not as destroyers, but as homeseekers. They felt a\r\nreal reverence for Roman civilization. And fourth, some of the principal\r\nGermanic nations, including the Visigoths, Burgundians, and Vandals, were\r\nalready Christians at the time of their invasions, while other nations,\r\nsuch as the Franks and the Anglo-Saxons, were afterwards converted to\r\nChristianity. As long, however, as most of the Germans remained Arian\r\nChristians [32] their belief stood in the way of friendly intercourse with\r\nthe Roman provincials, who had accepted the Catholic faith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, THE PEOPLES OF EUROPE at the beginning of the Tenth\r\nCentury.]\r\n\r\nCONTRAST BETWEEN EAST AND WEST\r\n\r\nIf western Europe during the early Middle Ages presented a scene of\r\nviolence and confusion while the Germans were settling in their new homes,\r\na different picture was afforded by eastern Europe. Here the Roman Empire\r\nstill survived and continued to uphold for centuries the Roman tradition\r\nof law and order.

THE ROMAN EMPIRE IN THE EAST\r\n\r\nSURVIVAL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE IN THE EAST\r\n\r\nThe Roman Empire in the West moved rapidly to its \"fall\" in 476 A.D., at\r\nthe hands of the Germanic invaders. The Roman Empire in the East, though\r\nthreatened by enemies from without and weakened by civil conflicts from\r\nwithin, endured for more than a thousand years. Until the middle of the\r\neleventh century it was the strongest state in Europe, except during the\r\nreign of Charlemagne, when the Frankish kingdom eclipsed it. Until the\r\nmiddle of the fifteenth century it preserved the name, the civilization,\r\nand some part of the dominions, of ancient Rome. [1]\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF THE SURVIVAL\r\n\r\nThe long life of the Roman Empire in the East is one of the marvels of\r\nhistory. Its great and constant vitality appears the more remarkable, when\r\none considers that it had no easily defensible frontiers, contained many\r\ndifferent races with little in common, and on all sides faced hostile\r\nstates. The empire survived so long, because of its vast wealth and\r\nresources, its despotic, centralized government, the strength of its army,\r\nand the almost impregnable position occupied by Constantinople, the\r\ncapital city.\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF THE EMPIRE\r\n\r\nThe changing fortunes of the empire during the Middle Ages are reflected\r\nin some of the names by which it is often known. The term \"Greek Empire\"\r\nexpresses the fact that the state became more and more Greek in character,\r\nowing to the loss, first of the western provinces in the fifth century,\r\nand then of Syria and Egypt in the seventh century. Another term--\r\n\"Byzantine Empire\"--appropriately describes the condition of the state in\r\nstill later times, when its possessions were reduced to Constantinople\r\n(ancient Byzantium) and the territory in the neighborhood of that city.\r\nBut through all this period the rulers at Constantinople regarded\r\nthemselves as the true successors of Augustus, Diocletian, and\r\nConstantine. They never admitted the right of Charlemagne and Otto the\r\nGreat to establish a rival Roman Empire in western Europe. [2] They\r\nclaimed to be the only legitimate heirs of Old Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n115. THE REIGN OF JUSTINIAN, 527-565 A.D.\r\n\r\nSUCCESSORS OF THEODOSIUS, 395-527 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Roman Empire in the East, for more than one hundred\r\nyears after the death of Theodosius, is uneventful. His successors, though\r\nunable to prevent the Germans from seizing Italy and the other western\r\nprovinces, managed to keep their own dominions intact. The eastern\r\nprovinces escaped the fate of those in the West, because they were more\r\npopulous and offered greater obstacles to the barbarian invaders, who\r\nfollowed the line of least resistance. The gradual recovery of the empire\r\nin strength and warlike energy prepared the way for a really eminent\r\nruler--Justinian.\r\n\r\nJUSTINIAN AND THEODORA\r\n\r\nJustinian is described as a man of noble bearing, simple in his habits,\r\naffable in speech, and easy of approach to all his subjects. Historians\r\nhave often drawn attention to his wonderful activity of mind and power of\r\nsteady industry. So great was his zeal for work that one of his courtiers\r\ncalled him \"the emperor who never sleeps.\" Possessed of large ideas and\r\ninspired by the majesty of Rome, Justinian aimed to be a great conqueror,\r\na great lawgiver, and a great restorer of civilization. His success in\r\nwhatever he undertook must be ascribed in part to his wife, Theodora, whom\r\nhe associated with himself on the throne. Theodora, strong of mind and\r\nwise in counsel, made a worthy helpmate for Justinian, who more than once\r\ndeclared that in affairs of state he had consulted his \"revered wife.\"\r\n\r\nCONQUESTS OF JUSTINIAN\r\n\r\nIt was the ambition of Justinian to conquer the Germanic kingdoms which\r\nhad been formed out of the Mediterranean provinces. In this task he relied\r\nchiefly on the military genius of Belisarius, one of the world's foremost\r\ncommanders. Belisarius was able in one short campaign to destroy the\r\nVandal kingdom in North Africa. [3] The Vandals by this time had lost\r\ntheir early vigor; they made but a feeble resistance; and their Roman\r\nsubjects welcomed Belisarius as a deliverer. Justinian awarded a triumph\r\nto his victorious general, an honor which for five centuries emperors\r\nalone had enjoyed. The conquest of North Africa, together with the islands\r\nof Sardinia and Corsica, was followed by the overthrow of the Ostrogothic\r\nkingdom in Sicily and Italy. [4] Justinian also recovered from the\r\nVisigoths [5] the southeastern part of Spain. He could now say with truth\r\nthat the Mediterranean was once more a Roman sea. [6]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MOSAIC OF JUSTINIAN\r\nA mosaic dating from 547 A.D., in the church of San Vitale, Ravenna. It\r\nshows the emperor (in the center) with a bishop, his suite and imperial\r\nguards. The picture probably gives us a fair idea of Justinian's\r\nappearance, though it represents him as somewhat younger than he was at\r\nthe time.]\r\n\r\nCODIFICATION OF ROMAN LAW\r\n\r\nThe conquests of Justinian proved to be less enduring than his work as a\r\nlawgiver. Until his reign the sources of Roman law, including the\r\nlegislation of the popular assemblies, the decrees of the Senate, the\r\nedicts of the of Roman praetors and emperors, and the decisions of learned\r\nlawyers, had never been completely collected and arranged in scientific\r\nform. Justinian appointed a commission of legal scholars to perform this\r\ntask. The result of their labors, in which the emperor himself assisted,\r\nwas the publication of the _Corpus Juris Civilis_, the \"Body of Civil\r\nLaw.\" Under this form the Roman principles of jurisprudence have become\r\nthe foundation of the legal systems of modern Italy, Spain, France,\r\nGermany, and other European countries. These principles even influenced\r\nthe Common law of England, which has been adopted by the United States.\r\n[7] The _Corpus Juris Civilis_, because of this widespread influence, is\r\njustly regarded as one of Rome's most important gifts to the world.\r\n\r\nCIVILIZING WORK OF JUSTINIAN\r\n\r\nJustinian's claim to the title of \"Great\" rests also on his civilizing\r\nwork. He wished to restore the prosperity, as well as the provinces, of\r\nthe empire. During his reign roads, bridges, and aqueducts were repaired,\r\nand commerce and agriculture were encouraged. It was at this time that two\r\nChristian missionaries brought from China the eggs of the silkworm, and\r\nintroduced the manufacture of silk in Europe. As a builder Justinian\r\ngained special fame. The edifices which he caused to be raised throughout\r\nhis dominions included massive fortifications on the exposed frontiers,\r\nsplendid palaces, and many monasteries and churches. The most noteworthy\r\nmonument to his piety is the church of Sancta Sophia [8] at\r\nConstantinople, now used as a Mohammedan mosque. By his conquests, his\r\nlaws, and his buildings, Justinian revived for a time the waning glory of\r\nimperial Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n116. THE EMPIRE AND ITS ASIATIC FOES\r\n\r\nAFTER JUSTINIAN\r\n\r\nThe Roman Empire in the East did not long remain at the pinnacle of\r\ngreatness to which Justinian had raised it. His conquests, indeed,\r\nweakened rather than strengthened the empire, since now there were much\r\nmore extensive frontiers to defend. Within half a century after his death\r\nit was attacked both in Europe and in Asia. The Lombards [9] soon seized\r\nItaly, and in the East the Persians renewed their contest against the\r\nRoman power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, THE ROMAN EMPIRE IN THE EAST DURING THE TENTH AND\r\nELEVENTH CENTURIES]\r\n\r\nPERSIANS\r\n\r\nThe struggle with the Persians was an inheritance from earlier times. [10]\r\nUnder an ambitious king, Chosroes II, the Persians overran all the Asiatic\r\nprovinces of the empire. A savior arose, however, in the person of the\r\nRoman emperor, Heraclius (610-641 A.D.). His brilliant campaigns against\r\nChosroes partook of the nature of a crusade, or \"holy war,\" for the\r\nPersians had violated the Holy Sepulcher at Jerusalem and had stolen away\r\nthe True Cross, the most sacred relic of Christendom. Heraclius recovered\r\nall his provinces, but only at the cost of a bloody struggle which drained\r\nthem of men and money and helped to make them fall easy victims to foes\r\nstill more terrible than the Persians. These were the Arabs.\r\n\r\nARABS\r\n\r\nHeraclius had not closed his reign before he saw all his victories undone\r\nby the advance of the Arabs. The first wave of invasion tore away Syria\r\nand Egypt from the empire, penetrated Asia Minor, and reached the shores\r\nof the Bosporus. Repulsed before the walls of Constantinople, the Arabs\r\ncarried their arms to the West and seized North Africa, Spain, part of\r\nsouthern Italy, and the Mediterranean islands. Asia Minor and the Balkan\r\npeninsula still held out, however, and during the tenth century a line of\r\nable rulers at Constantinople succeeded in winning back some of their lost\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nSELJUK TURKS\r\n\r\nDuring the eleventh century the empire had to face new enemies. These were\r\nthe Seljuk Turks, [11] fierce nomads from the steppes beyond the Caspian.\r\nAfter their conversion to Mohammedanism, they swept with irresistible\r\nforce through the East and conquered nearly all Asia Minor. The ruin of\r\nthis country, in earlier ages one of the most populous and flourishing\r\nregions of the world, dates from its occupation by the Seljuks. To resist\r\ntheir further advance the Roman emperor sought in 1095 A.D. the help of\r\nthe Christians of Europe. His appeals for aid resulted in the First\r\nCrusade, with which a new chapter of medieval history began. (See Chapter\r\nXX.)\r\n\r\nWORK OF THE EMPIRE IN ASIA\r\n\r\nThus, for more than five centuries after Justinian, the Roman Empire in\r\nthe East was engaged in a long struggle with the foes--Persians, Arabs,\r\nand Seljuk Turks--which successively attacked its dominions. By its\r\nstubborn resistance of the advance of the invaders the old empire\r\nprotected the young states of Europe from attack, until they grew strong\r\nenough to meet and repulse the hordes of Asia. This service to\r\ncivilization was not less important than that which had been performed by\r\nGreece and Rome in their contests with the Persians and the Carthaginians.\r\n\r\n\r\n117. THE EMPIRE AND ITS FOES IN EUROPE\r\n\r\nSLAVS\r\n\r\nThe troubled years after Justinian's death also witnessed the beginning of\r\nthe Slavic [12] settlements in southeastern Europe. The Slavs belonged to\r\nthe Indo-European race, but had not progressed in civilization as far as\r\nthe Germans. Their cradle land seems to have been in western Russia,\r\nwhence they slowly spread to the Baltic, the Elbe, and the Danube. We have\r\nalready mentioned the campaigns which Charlemagne and Henry the Fowler\r\nwaged against them. [13] The emperors at Constantinople were less\r\nsuccessful in resisting that branch of the Slavs which tried to occupy the\r\nBalkan peninsula. After crossing the Danube, the Slavs pressed on farther\r\nand farther, until they reached the southern extremity of ancient Greece.\r\nThey avoided the cities, but formed peasant communities in the open\r\ncountry, where they readily mingled with the inhabitants. Their\r\ndescendants have remained in the Balkan peninsula to this day. The\r\ninhabitants of modern Serbia [14] are Slavs, and even in the Greeks there\r\nis a considerable strain of Slavic blood.\r\n\r\nBULGARIANS\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians, a people akin to the Huns and Avars, made their appearance\r\nsouth of the lower Danube in the seventh century. For more than three\r\nhundred years these barbarians, brutal, fierce, and cruel, were a menace\r\nto the empire. At one time they threatened Constantinople and even killed\r\na Roman emperor, whose skull was converted into a drinking cup to grace\r\ntheir feasts. The Bulgarians settled in the region which now bears their\r\nname and gradually adopted the speech and customs of the Slavs. Modern\r\nBulgaria is essentially a Slavic state.\r\n\r\nRUSSIANS\r\n\r\nThe empire was attacked in southeastern Europe by still other barbarians,\r\namong whom were the Russians. This Slavic people, led by chieftains from\r\nSweden, descended the Dnieper and Dniester rivers and, crossing the Black\r\nSea, appeared before the walls of Constantinople. Already, in the tenth\r\ncentury, that city formed the goal of Russian ambitions. The invaders are\r\nsaid to have made four attempts to plunder its treasures. Though\r\nunsuccessful, they compelled the emperors from time to time to pay them\r\ntribute.\r\n\r\nWORK OF THE EMPIRE IN EUROPE\r\n\r\nChristianity reached the invaders of the Balkan peninsula from\r\nConstantinople. The Serbians, Bulgarians, and Russians were converted in\r\nthe ninth and tenth centuries. With Christianity they received the use of\r\nletters and some knowledge of Roman law and methods of government.\r\nConstantinople was to them, henceforth, such a center of religion and\r\nculture as Rome was to the Germans. By becoming the teacher of the vast\r\nSlavic peoples of the Balkan peninsula and European Russia, the empire\r\nperformed another important service to civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n118. BYZANTINE CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH AND WEALTH OF THE EMPIRE\r\n\r\nThe Roman Empire in the East, though often menaced by barbarian foes, long\r\ncontinued to be the leading European power. Its highest degree of\r\nprosperity was reached between the middle of the ninth and the middle of\r\nthe eleventh century. The provinces in Asia Minor and the Balkan peninsula\r\nproduced a vast annual revenue, much of which went for defense. It was\r\nnecessary to maintain a large, well-disciplined army, great fleets and\r\nengines of war, and the extensive fortifications of Constantinople and the\r\nfrontier cities. Confronted by so many dangers, the empire could hope to\r\nsurvive only by making itself a strong military state.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE AND INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nThe merchant ships of Constantinople, during the earlier part of the\r\nMiddle Ages, carried on most of the commerce of the Mediterranean and the\r\nBlack Sea. The products of Byzantine industry, including silks,\r\nembroideries, mosaics, enamels, and metal work, were exchanged at that\r\ncity for the spices, drugs, and precious stones of the East. Byzantine\r\nwares also found their way into Italy and France and, by way of the\r\nRussian rivers, reached the heart of eastern Europe. Russia, in turn,\r\nfurnished Constantinople with large quantities of honey, wax, fur, wool,\r\ngrain, and slaves. A traveler of the twelfth century well described the\r\ncity as a metropolis \"common to all the world, without distinction of\r\ncountry or religion.\"\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF BYZANTINE ART\r\n\r\nMany of the Roman emperors from Justinian onward were great builders.\r\nByzantine architecture, seen especially in the churches, became a leading\r\nform of art. Its most striking feature is the dome, which replaces the\r\nflat, wooden roof used in the basilican [15] Churches of Italy. The\r\nexterior of a Byzantine church is plain and unimposing, but the interior\r\nis adorned on a magnificent scale. The eyes of the worshiper are dazzled\r\nby the walls faced with marble slabs of variegated colors, by the columns\r\nof polished marble, jasper, and porphyry, and by the brilliant mosaic\r\npictures of gilded glass. The entire impression is one of richness and\r\nsplendor. Byzantine artists, though mediocre painters and sculptors,\r\nexcelled in all kinds of decorative work. Their carvings in wood, ivory,\r\nand metal, together with their embroideries, enamels, and miniatures,\r\nenjoyed a high reputation throughout medieval Europe.\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF BYZANTINE ART\r\n\r\nByzantine art, from the sixth century to the present time, has exerted a\r\nwide influence. Sicily, southern Italy, Rome, Ravenna, and Venice contain\r\nmany examples of Byzantine churches. Italian painting in the Middle Ages\r\nseems to have been derived directly from the mosaic pictures of the\r\nartists of Constantinople. Russia received not only its religion but also\r\nits art from Constantinople. The great Russian churches of Moscow and\r\nPetrograd follow Byzantine models. Even the Arabs, in spite of their\r\nhostility to Christianity, borrowed Byzantine artists and profited by\r\ntheir services. The Mohammedan mosques of Damascus, Cairo, and Cordova,\r\nboth in methods of construction and in details of ornamentation, reproduce\r\nByzantine styles.\r\n\r\nLITERATURE AND LEARNING\r\n\r\nThe libraries and museums of Constantinople preserved classical learning.\r\nIn the flourishing schools of that city the wisest men of the day taught\r\nphilosophy, law, medicine, and science to thousands of students. The\r\nprofessors figured among the important persons of the court: official\r\ndocuments mention the \"prince of the rhetoricians\" and the \"consul of the\r\nphilosophers.\" Many of the emperors showed a taste for scholarship; one of\r\nthem was said to have been so devoted to study that he almost forgot to\r\nreign. When kings in western Europe were so ignorant that they could with\r\ndifficulty scrawl their names, eastern emperors wrote books and composed\r\npoetry. It is true that Byzantine scholars were erudite rather than\r\noriginal. Impressed by the great treasures of knowledge about them, they\r\nfound it difficult to strike out into new, unbeaten paths. Most students\r\nwere content to make huge collections of extracts and notes from the books\r\nwhich antiquity had bequeathed to them. Even this task was useful,\r\nhowever, for their encyclopedias preserved much information which\r\notherwise would have been lost. During the Middle Ages the East cherished\r\nthe productions of classical learning, until the time came when the West\r\nwas ready to receive them and to profit by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n119. CONSTANTINOPLE\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF CONSTANTINOPLE\r\n\r\nThe heart of Byzantine civilization was Constantinople. The city lies on a\r\npeninsula between the Sea of Marmora and the spacious harbor called the\r\nGolden Horn. Washed on three sides by the water and, like Rome, enthroned\r\nupon seven hills, Constantinople occupies a site justly celebrated as the\r\nnoblest in the world. It stands in Europe, looks on Asia, and commands the\r\nentrance to both the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. As a sixteenth\r\ncentury writer pointed out, Constantinople \"is a city which Nature herself\r\nhas designed to be the mistress of the world.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, VICINITY OF CONSTANTINOPLE]\r\n\r\nCONSTANTINOPLE AS A NATURAL CITADEL\r\n\r\nThe position of Constantinople made it difficult to attack but easy to\r\ndefend. To surround the city an enemy would have to be strong upon both\r\nland and sea. A hostile army, advancing through Asia Minor, found its\r\nfurther advance arrested by the long, winding channel which the Bosporus,\r\nthe Sea of Marmora, and the Dardanelles combine to form. A hostile fleet,\r\ncoming by way of the Mediterranean or the Black Sea, faced grave\r\ndifficulties in attempting to penetrate the narrow strait into which this\r\nwaterway contracts at each extremity. On the landward side the line of\r\ndefense was so short--about four miles in width--that it could be strongly\r\nfortified and held by a small force against large numbers. During the\r\nMiddle Ages the rear of the city was protected by two huge walls, the\r\nremains of which are still visible. Constantinople, in fact, was all but\r\nimpregnable. Though each new century brought a fresh horde of enemies, it\r\nresisted siege after siege and long continued to be the capital of what\r\nwas left of the Roman Empire. [16]\r\n\r\nMONUMENTS OF CONSTANTINOPLE\r\n\r\nConstantine had laid out his new city on an imposing scale and adorned it\r\nwith the choicest treasures of art from Greece, Italy, and the Orient.\r\nFourteen churches, fourteen palaces, eight public baths, and several\r\ntriumphal arches are assigned to the founder of the city. His most stately\r\nbuilding was the Hippodrome, an immense structure devoted to chariot races\r\nand all sorts of popular gatherings. There new emperors, after their\r\nconsecration in Sancta Sophia, were greeted by their subjects; there civic\r\nfestivals were held; and there the last Roman triumphs were celebrated.\r\nTheodosius the Great built the principal gate of Constantinople, the\r\n\"Golden Gate,\" as it was called, by which the emperors made their solemn\r\nentry into the city. But it was Justinian who, after Constantine, did most\r\nto adorn the new capital by the Bosporus. He is said to have erected more\r\nthan twenty-five churches in Constantinople and its suburbs. Of these, the\r\nmost beautiful is the world-famed cathedral dedicated by Justinian to\r\n\"Holy Wisdom.\" On its completion the emperor declared that he had\r\nsurpassed Solomon's Temple. Though nearly fourteen hundred years old and\r\nnow defaced by vandal hands, it remains perhaps the supreme achievement of\r\nChristian architecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SANCTA SOPHIA, CONSTANTINOPLE\r\nBuilt by Justinian and dedicated on Christmas Day, 538 A.D. The main\r\nbuilding is roofed over by a great central dome 107 feet in diameter and\r\n179 feet in height. After the Ottoman Turks turned the church into a\r\nmosque, a minaret was erected at each of the four exterior angles. The\r\noutside of Sancta Sophia is somewhat disappointing, but the interior, with\r\nits walls and columns of polished marble granite and porphyry, is\r\nmagnificent. The crystal balustrades, pulpits, and large metal disks are\r\nTurkish.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE THREE EXISTING MONUMENTS OF THE HIPPODROME,\r\nCONSTANTINOPLE.\r\n\r\nThese three monuments preserve for us the exact line of the low wall or\r\n_spina_, which divided the race course and around which the charioteers\r\ndrove their furious steeds. The obelisk was transported from Egypt by\r\nConstantine. Between it and the crumbling tower beyond is a pillar of\r\nthree brazen serpents, originally set up at Delphi by the Greeks, after\r\nthe battle of Plataea. On this trophy were engraved the names of the\r\nvarious states that sent soldiers to fight the Persians.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, CONSTANTINOPLE]\r\n\r\nHISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE OF CONSTANTINOPLE\r\n\r\nExcepting Athens and Rome, no other European city can lay claim to so long\r\nand so important a history as Constantinople. Her day came after theirs\r\nwas done. Throughout the Middle Ages Constantinople remained the most\r\nimportant city in Europe. When London, Paris, and Vienna were small and\r\nmean towns, Constantinople was a large and flourishing metropolis. The\r\nrenown of the city penetrated even into barbarian lands. The Scandinavians\r\ncalled it Micklegarth, the \"Great City\"; the Russians knew of it as\r\nTsarigrad, the \"City of the Caesars.\" But its own people best described it\r\nas the \"City guarded by God.\" Here, for more than eleven centuries, was\r\nthe capital of the Roman Empire and the center of Eastern Christendom.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH\r\n\r\nTHE CATHOLIC CHURCH\r\n\r\nA preceding chapter has traced the early history of Christianity. We there\r\nsaw how the new religion appeared in the Orient, how it spread rapidly\r\nover the Roman Empire, how it engaged with the imperial government in the\r\nlong conflict called the Persecutions, how the emperor Constantine, after\r\nhis conversion, placed it on an equality with paganism, and how at the end\r\nof the fourth century the emperor Theodosius made it the state religion.\r\nBy this time the Church had become a great and powerful organization, with\r\nfixed laws, with a graded system of officers, and with councils attended\r\nby clergy from all parts of the Roman world. To this organization the word\r\nCatholic, that is, \"universal,\" came to be applied. Membership in the\r\nCatholic Church, secured only by baptism, was believed to be essential to\r\nsalvation. As St. Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, had said, \"He can no longer\r\nhave God for his Father who has not the Church for his Mother.\"\r\n\r\nTHE EPISCOPATE\r\n\r\nThe first three centuries of Christianity witnessed the development of the\r\nepiscopal system in the Church. Each provincial city had its bishop,\r\nassisted by priests and deacons. An archbishop (sometimes called a\r\nmetropolitan) presided over the bishops of each province, and a patriarch\r\nhad jurisdiction, in turn, over metropolitans. This graded arrangement of\r\necclesiastical officers, from the lowest to the highest, helped to make\r\nthe Church centralized and strong. It appears to have been modeled, almost\r\nunconsciously, on the government of the Roman Empire. [2]\r\n\r\nTHE PATRIARCHS\r\n\r\nThe development of the patriarchate calls for special notice. At the time\r\nof the Council of Nicaea [3] there were three patriarchs, namely, the\r\nbishops of Rome, Antioch, and Alexandria. These cities ranked among the\r\nmost important in the Roman world. It was only natural, therefore, that\r\nthe churches established in them should be singled out for preëminence.\r\nSome years after the removal of the capital to Constantinople, the bishop\r\nof that imperial city was recognized as a patriarch at a general council\r\nof the Church. In the fifth century the bishop of Jerusalem received the\r\nsame dignity. Henceforth there were five patriarchs--four in the East but\r\nonly one in the West.\r\n\r\nCLERGY AND LAITY\r\n\r\nThe Christian Church was a very democratic organization. Patriarchs,\r\narchbishops, bishops, priests, and deacons were drawn from all ranks of\r\nlife. No special training at first was considered necessary to fit them\r\nfor their duties, though the more celebrated ministers were often highly\r\neducated. To eke out their salaries the clergy sometimes carried on\r\nbusiness as farmers and shopkeepers. Where, however, a church had\r\nsufficient funds to support its bishop, his engagement in secular affairs\r\nwas discouraged and finally prohibited. In the fourth century, as earlier,\r\npriests and bishops were generally married men. The sentiment in favor of\r\ncelibacy for the clergy became very pronounced during the early Middle\r\nAges, especially in the West, and led at length to the general abandonment\r\nof priestly marriage in those parts of Europe where papal influence\r\nprevailed. Distinctive garments for clergymen did not begin to come into\r\nuse until the fifth century, when some of them began to don clothing of a\r\nmore sober hue than was fashionable at the time. Clerical vestments were\r\ndeveloped from two pieces of ancient Roman dress--the tunic and the toga.\r\n[4] Thus the clergy were gradually separated from the people, or laity, by\r\ndifferences in dress, by their celibate lives, and by their abstention\r\nfrom worldly occupations.\r\n\r\nHERESIES\r\n\r\nWhile the Church was perfecting her organization, she was also elaborating\r\nher doctrines. Theologians engaged in many controversies upon such\r\nsubjects as the connection of Christ with God and the nature of the\r\nTrinity. In order to obtain an authoritative expression of Christian\r\nopinion, councils of the higher clergy were held, at which the opposing\r\nviews were debated and a decision was reached. The Council of Nicaea,\r\nwhich condemned Arianism, formed the first, and one of the most important,\r\nof these general gatherings of the Church. After the Church had once\r\nexpressed itself on any matter of Christian belief, it was regarded as\r\nunlawful to maintain a contrary opinion. Those who did so were called\r\nheretics, and their teachings, heresies. The emperor Theodosius, whose\r\nsevere laws finally shattered the ancient paganism, [5] devoted even more\r\nattention to stamping out heresies among his Christian subjects. He\r\nprohibited meetings of heretics, burned their books, and threatened them\r\nwith death if they persisted in their peculiar doctrines. During his reign\r\na Spanish bishop and six of his partisans were executed for holding\r\nunorthodox beliefs. This was the beginning of the persecutions for heresy.\r\n\r\nWORSHIP\r\n\r\nAs soon as Christianity had triumphed in the Roman Empire, thus becoming\r\nthe religion of the rich and powerful as well as the religion of the poor\r\nand lowly, more attention was devoted to the conduct of worship.\r\nMagnificent church buildings were often erected. Their architects seem to\r\nhave followed as models the basilicas, or public halls, which formed so\r\nfamiliar a sight in Roman cities. [6] Church interiors were adorned with\r\npaintings, mosaic pictures, images of saints and martyrs, and the figure\r\nof the cross. Lighted candles on the altars and the burning of fragrant\r\nincense lent an additional impressiveness to worship. Beautiful prayers\r\nand hymns were composed. Some of the early Christian hymns, such as the\r\n_Gloria in Excelsis_ and the _Te Deum Laudamus_, are still sung in our\r\nchurches. Organs did not come into use until the seventh century, and then\r\nonly in the West, but church bells, summoning the worshiper to divine\r\nservice, early became attached to Christian edifices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RELIGIOUS MUSIC\r\nFrom a window of the cathedral of Bourges, a city in central France. Shows\r\na pipe organ and chimes.]\r\n\r\nSUNDAY\r\n\r\nThe Christians from the start appear to have observed \"the first day of\r\nthe week\" [7] in memory of Christ's resurrection. They attended public\r\nworship on the Lord's Day, but otherwise did not rigidly abstain from\r\nworldly business and amusements. The Jewish element in some churches, and\r\nespecially in the East, was strong enough to secure an additional\r\nobservance of Saturday as a weekly festival. Saturday long continued to be\r\nmarked by religious assemblies and feasting, though not by any compulsory\r\ncessation of the ordinary occupations. During the fourth century Sunday,\r\nas the Lord's Day was now generally called, came more and more to be kept\r\nas a day of obligatory rest. Constantine's Sunday law [8] formed the first\r\nof a long series of imperial edicts imposing the observance of that day as\r\na legal duty. In this manner Sunday, like the Jewish Sabbath on the\r\nseventh day of the week, was dedicated wholly to the exercises of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nFESTIVALS\r\n\r\nThe great yearly festivals of the Church gradually took shape during the\r\nearly Christian centuries. The most important anniversary to be observed\r\nwas Easter, in memory of the resurrection of Christ. A period of fasting\r\n(Lent), which finally lasted forty days, preceded the festival.\r\nWhitsunday, or Pentecost, was celebrated on the fiftieth day after Easter.\r\n[9] Two other festivals of later adoption were Christmas, the celebration\r\nof which was finally assigned to the 25th of December, [10] and Epiphany\r\n(January 6), commemorating the baptism of Christ. In course of time many\r\nother feasts and fasts, together with numerous saints' days, were added to\r\nthe calendar of the \"Christian Year.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n121. EASTERN CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nEXPANSION OF CHRISTIANITY IN THE EAST\r\n\r\nBy the time of Constantine, Christianity had spread widely throughout the\r\neastern half of the Roman Empire. Asia Minor was then largely Christian.\r\nThrace, Macedonia, Epirus, and Greece were all ecclesiastical provinces\r\nwith their own metropolitans. Many Christians were found in Syria and\r\nEgypt. Churches also existed in Mesopotamia and Arabia, and even beyond\r\nthe boundaries of the empire in Armenia and Persia. Between the time of\r\nConstantine and that of Justinian, Christianity continued to expand in the\r\nEast, until the gospel had been carried to such distant regions as\r\nAbyssinia and India.\r\n\r\nUNION OF CHURCH AND STATE\r\n\r\nMost of the Christian communities in the Orient owed allegiance to the\r\npatriarchs of Constantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch, and Alexandria. The\r\nRoman emperor, however, was the supreme religious authority in the East.\r\nHe felt it as much his duty to maintain the doctrines and organization of\r\nChristianity as to preserve the imperial dominions against foreign foes.\r\nSince he presided over the Church, there could be no real independence for\r\nits officers. Bishops, metropolitans, and patriarchs were in every respect\r\nsubordinate to his will. This union of Church and State formed one of the\r\nmost characteristic features of Christianity in the East.\r\n\r\nTHEOLOGICAL DISPUTES; HERESIES\r\n\r\nEastern Christians, far more than those in the West, devoted themselves to\r\ntheological speculations. Constantinople and the great Hellenistic cities\r\nof Antioch and Alexandria contained many learned scholars who had\r\nprolonged and heated arguments over subtle questions of belief. After the\r\nArian controversy had been settled in the fourth century, other disputes\r\nconcerning the true nature of Christ broke out. These gave rise to many\r\nheresies.\r\n\r\nNESTORIANISM\r\n\r\nThe heresy known as Nestorianism, from Nestorius, a patriarch of\r\nConstantinople, spread widely in the East. Nestorian missionaries even\r\npenetrated to India, China, and Mongolia. The churches which they\r\nestablished were numerous and influential during the Middle Ages, but\r\nsince then most of them have been destroyed by the Mohammedans. Members of\r\nthis sect are still to be found, however, in eastern lands. [11]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NESTORIAN MONUMENT\r\nEvidence of Nestorian missions in China is afforded by the famous monument\r\nat Chang-an, province of Shensi. The stone, which was set up in 781 A.D.,\r\ncommemorates by an inscription in Chinese characters and the figure of a\r\ncross the introduction of Christianity into northwestern China. A replica\r\nof the Nestorian monument was taken to the United States in 1908 A.D. and\r\nwas deposited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.]\r\n\r\nORTHODOXY\r\n\r\nAfter the formation of the Nestorian and other heretical sects, the\r\northodox faith was preserved in the East only by the Greeks of Asia Minor\r\nand Europe. The Greek Church, which calls itself the \"Holy Orthodox\r\nChurch,\" for a time remained in unity with the Roman Church in the West.\r\nThe final separation of these two churches occurred in the eleventh\r\ncentury. [12]\r\n\r\n\r\n122. WESTERN CHRISTIANITY: RISE OF THE PAPACY\r\n\r\nTHE PAPACY\r\n\r\nChristianity in the West presented two sharp contrasts to eastern\r\nChristianity. In the first place, the great heresies which divided the\r\nEast scarcely affected the West. In the second place, no union of Church\r\nand State existed among western Christians. Instead of acknowledging the\r\nreligious supremacy of the emperor at Constantinople, they yielded\r\nobedience to the bishop of Rome, the head of the Roman Church. He is known\r\nto us as the pope, and his office is called the Papacy. We shall now\r\ninquire how the popes secured their unchallenged authority over western\r\nChristendom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAPAL ARMS\r\nAccording to the well-known passage in _Matthew_ (xvi, 19), Christ gave to\r\nSt. Peter the \"keys of the kingdom of heaven,\" with the power \"to bind and\r\nto loose.\" These keys are always represented in the papal arms, together\r\nwith the tiara or headdress, worn by the popes on certain occasions.]\r\n\r\nROME AN APOSTOLIC CHURCH\r\n\r\nA church in Rome must have been established at an early date, for it was\r\nto Roman Christians that St. Paul addressed one of the _Epistles_ now\r\npreserved in the New Testament. St. Paul visited Rome, as we know from the\r\n_Acts of the Apostles_, and there he is said to have suffered martyrdom.\r\nChristian tradition, very ancient and very generally received, declares\r\nthat St. Peter also labored in Rome, where he met a martyr's death,\r\nperhaps during the reign of the emperor Nero. To the early Christians,\r\ntherefore, the Roman Church must have seemed in the highest degree sacred,\r\nfor it had been founded by the two greatest apostles and had been\r\nnourished by their blood.\r\n\r\nROME A \"MOTHER-CHURCH\"\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance helped to give the Roman Church a superior position\r\nin the West. It was a vigorous missionary church. Rome, the largest and\r\nmost flourishing city in the empire and the seat of the imperial\r\ngovernment, naturally became the center from which Christianity spread\r\nover the western provinces. Many of the early Christian communities\r\nplanted in Spain, Gaul, and Africa owed their start to the missionary zeal\r\nof the Roman Church. To Rome, as the great \"Mother-church,\" her daughters\r\nin western Europe would turn henceforth with reverence and affection; they\r\nwould readily acknowledge her leading place among the churches; and they\r\nwould seek her advice on disputed points of Christian belief or worship.\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN CHURCH INDEPENDENT\r\n\r\nThe independence of the Roman Church also furthered its development. The\r\nbishop of Rome was the sole patriarch in the West, while in the East there\r\nwere two, and later four patriarchs, each exercising authority in\r\nreligious matters. Furthermore, the removal of the capital from Rome to\r\nConstantinople helped to free the Roman bishop from the close oversight of\r\nthe imperial government. He was able, henceforth, to promote the interests\r\nof the church under his control without much interference on the part of\r\nthe eastern emperor.\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN CHURCH ORTHODOX\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be noted how much the development of the Roman Church was\r\naided by its attitude on disputed questions of belief. While eastern\r\nChristendom was torn by theological controversies, the Church of Rome\r\nstood firmly by the Nicene Creed. [13] After the Arian, Nestorian, and\r\nother heresies were finally condemned, orthodox Christians felt indebted\r\nto the Roman Church for its unwavering championship of \"the faith once\r\ndelivered to the saints.\" They were all the more ready, therefore, to\r\ndefer to that church in matters of doctrine and to accept without question\r\nits spiritual authority.\r\n\r\nTHE PETRINE SUPREMACY\r\n\r\nThe claim of the Roman bishops to supremacy over the Christian world had a\r\ndouble basis. Certain passages in the New Testament, where St. Peter is\r\nrepresented as the rock on which the Church is built, the pastor of the\r\nsheep and lambs of the Lord, and the doorkeeper of the kingdom of heaven,\r\nappear to indicate that he was regarded by Christ as the chief of the\r\nApostles. Furthermore, a well-established tradition made St. Peter the\r\nfounder of the Roman Church and its first bishop. It was then argued that\r\nhe passed to his successors, the popes, all his rights and dignity. As St.\r\nPeter was the first among the Apostles, so the popes were to be the first\r\namong bishops. Such was the doctrine of the Petrine supremacy, expressed\r\nas far back as the second century, strongly asserted by many popes during\r\nthe Middle Ages, and maintained to-day by the Roman Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n123. GROWTH OF THE PAPACY\r\n\r\nPONTIFICATE OF LEO I, 440-461 A.D.\r\n\r\nUp to the middle of the fifth century about forty-five bishops had\r\noccupied St. Peter's chair at Rome. The most eminent these was Leo the\r\nGreat. When he became bishop, the Germans were overrunning the western\r\nprovinces of the empire. The invaders professed the Arian faith, as we\r\nhave seen, and often persecuted the orthodox Christians among whom they\r\nsettled. At such a time, when the imperial power was growing weaker,\r\nfaithful Catholics in the West naturally turned for support to the bishop\r\nof Rome. Leo became their champion against the barbarians. Tradition\r\ndeclares that he succeeded in diverting Attila from an attack on Rome, and\r\nwhen the Vandals sacked the city Leo also intervened to prevent its\r\ndestruction. [14]\r\n\r\nPONTIFICATE OF GREGORY I, 590-604 A.D.\r\n\r\nAfter Leo, no important name occurs in the list of popes until we come to\r\nGregory the Great. Gregory, as the son of a rich and distinguished Roman\r\nsenator, enjoyed a good education in all the learning of the time. He\r\nentered public life and at an early age became prefect of Rome. But now,\r\nalmost at the outset of his career, Gregory laid aside earthly ambition.\r\nHe gave up his honorable position and spent the fortune, inherited from\r\nhis father, in the foundation of monasteries and the relief of the poor.\r\nHe himself became a monk, turned his palace at Rome into a monastery, and\r\nalmost ruined his health by too great devotion to fasts and midnight\r\nvigils. Gregory's conspicuous talents, however, soon called him from\r\nretirement and led to his election as pope.\r\n\r\nTEMPORAL POWER OF GREGORY\r\n\r\nThe work of Gregory lay principally in two directions. As a statesman he\r\ndid much to make the popes virtual sovereigns at Rome and in Italy. At\r\nthis time the Italian peninsula, overrun by the Lombards and neglected by\r\nthe eastern emperor, was in a deplorable condition. The bishop of Rome\r\nseemed to be the only man who could protect the people and maintain order.\r\nGregory had very great success in this task. He appointed governors of\r\ncities, issued orders to generals, drilled the Romans for military\r\ndefense, and sent ambassadors to treat with the king of the Lombards. It\r\nwas largely owing to Gregory's efforts that these barbarians were\r\nprevented from conquering central Italy.\r\n\r\nGREGORY'S SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY\r\n\r\nGregory was no less eminent as a churchman. His writings and his personal\r\ninfluence greatly furthered the advancement of the Roman Church in the\r\nWest. We find him sternly repressing heresies wherever they arose, aiding\r\nthe conversion of Arian Visigoths in Spain and Arian Lombards in Italy,\r\nand sending out monks as missionaries to distant Britain. [15] He well\r\ndeserved by these labors the title \"Servant of the servants of God,\" [16]\r\nwhich he assumed, and which the popes after him have retained. The\r\nadmiration felt for his character and abilities raised him, in later ages,\r\nto the rank of a saint.\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE PAPACY\r\n\r\nWhen Gregory the Great closed his remarkable career, the Papacy had\r\nreached a commanding place in western Christendom. To their spiritual\r\nauthority the popes had now begun to add some measure of temporal power as\r\nrulers at Rome and in Italy. During the eighth century, as we have already\r\nlearned, [17] the alliance of the popes and the Franks helped further to\r\nestablish the Papacy as an ecclesiastical monarchy, ruling over both the\r\nsouls and bodies of men. Henceforth it was to go forward from strength to\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n\r\n124. MONASTICISM\r\n\r\nTHE MONASTIC SPIRIT\r\n\r\nThe Papacy during the Middle Ages found its strongest supporters among the\r\nmonks. By the time of Gregory the Great monasticism [18] was well\r\nestablished in the Christian Church. Its origin must be sought in the\r\nneed, often felt by spiritually-minded men, of withdrawing from the world\r\n--from its temptations and its transitory pleasures--to a life of\r\nsolitude, prayer, and religious contemplation. Joined to this feeling has\r\nbeen the conviction that the soul may be purified by subduing the desires\r\nand passions of the body. Men, influenced by the monastic spirit, sought\r\na closer approach to God.\r\n\r\nEARLY CHRISTIAN MONASTICISM\r\n\r\nThe monastic spirit in Christianity owed much to the example of its\r\nfounder, who was himself unmarried, poor, and without a place \"where to\r\nlay his head.\" Some of Christ's teachings, taken literally, also helped to\r\nexalt the worth of the monastic life. At a very early period there were\r\nChristian men and women who abstained from marriage, flesh meat, and the\r\nuse of wine, and gave themselves up to prayer, religious exercises, and\r\nworks of charity. This they did in their homes, without abandoning their\r\nfamilies and human society.\r\n\r\nTHE HERMITS\r\n\r\nAnother monastic movement began about the middle of the third century,\r\nwhen many Christians in Egypt withdrew into the desert to live as hermits.\r\nSt. Anthony, who has been called the first Christian hermit, passed twenty\r\nyears in a deserted fort on the east bank of the Nile. During all this\r\ntime he never saw a human face. Some of the hermits, believing that pain\r\nand suffering had a spiritual value, went to extremes of self-\r\nmortification. They dwelt in wells, tombs, and on the summits of pillars,\r\ndeprived themselves of necessary food and sleep, wore no clothing, and\r\nneglected to bathe or to care for the body in any way. Other hermits, who\r\ndid not practice such austerities, spent all day or all night in prayer.\r\nThe examples of these recluses found many imitators in Syria and other\r\neastern lands. [19]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. DANIEL THE STYLITE ON HIS COLUMN\r\nFrom a Byzantine miniature in the Vatican.]\r\n\r\nRULE OF ST. BASIL\r\n\r\nA life shut off from all contact with one's fellows is difficult and\r\nbeyond the strength of ordinary men. The mere human need for social\r\nintercourse gradually brought the hermits together, at first in small\r\ngroups and then in larger communities, or monasteries. The next step was\r\nto give the scattered monasteries a common organization and government.\r\nThose in the East gradually adopted the regulations which St. Basil, a\r\nleading churchman of the fourth century, drew up for the guidance of the\r\nmonks under his direction. St. Basil's Rule, as it is called, has remained\r\nto the present time the basis of monasticism in the Greek Church.\r\n\r\nST. BENEDICT\r\n\r\nThe monastic system, which early gained an entrance into western\r\nChristendom, looked to St. Benedict as its organizer. While yet a young\r\nman, St. Benedict had sought to escape from the vice about him by retiring\r\nto a cave in the Sabine hills near Rome. Here he lived for three years as\r\na hermit, shutting himself off from all human intercourse, wearing a hair\r\nshirt, and rolling in beds of thistles to subdue \"the flesh.\" St.\r\nBenedict's experience of the hermit's life convinced him that there was a\r\nsurer and better road to religious peace of mind. His fame as a holy man\r\nhad attracted to him many disciples, and these he now began to group in\r\nmonastic communities under his own supervision. St. Benedict's most\r\nimportant monastery was at Monte Cassino, midway between Rome and Naples.\r\nIt became the capital of monasticism in the West.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF KIRKSTALL ABBEY, YORKSHIRE]\r\n\r\nRULE OF ST. BENEDICT, 529(?) A.D.\r\n\r\nTo control the monks of Monte Cassino St. Benedict framed a Rule, or\r\nconstitution, which was modeled in some respects upon the earlier Rule of\r\nSt. Basil. The monks formed a sort of corporation, presided over by an\r\nabbot, [20] who held office for life. To the abbot every candidate for\r\nadmission took the vow of obedience. Any man, rich or poor, noble or\r\npeasant, might enter the monastery, after a year's probation; having once\r\njoined, however, he must remain a monk for the rest of his days. The monks\r\nwere to live under strict discipline. They could not own any property;\r\nthey could not go beyond the monastery walls without the abbot's consent;\r\nthey could not even receive letters from home; and they were sent to bed\r\nearly. A violation of the regulations brought punishment in the shape of\r\nprivate admonitions, exclusion from common prayer, and, in extreme cases,\r\nexpulsion.\r\n\r\nSPREAD OF THE BENEDICTINE RULE\r\n\r\nThe Rule of St. Benedict came to have the same wide influence in the West\r\nwhich that of St. Basil exerted in the East. Gregory the Great established\r\nit in many places in Italy, Sicily, and England. During Charlemagne's\r\nreign it was made the only form of monasticism throughout his dominions.\r\nBy the tenth century the Rule prevailed everywhere in western Europe. [21]\r\n\r\n\r\n125. LIFE AND WORK OF THE MONKS\r\n\r\nA MONASTIC COMMUNITY\r\n\r\nSt. Benedict sought to draw a sharp line between the monastic life and\r\nthat of the outside world. Hence he required that, as far as possible,\r\neach monastery should form an independent, self-supporting community whose\r\nmembers had no need of going beyond its limits for anything. In course of\r\ntime, as a monastery increased in wealth and number of inmates, it might\r\ncome to form an enormous establishment, covering many acres and presenting\r\nwithin its massive walls the appearance of a fortified town.\r\n\r\nTHE MONASTERY BUILDINGS\r\n\r\nThe principal buildings of a Benedictine monastery of the larger sort were\r\ngrouped around an inner court, called a cloister. These included a church,\r\na refectory, or dining room, with the kitchen and buttery near it, a\r\ndormitory, where the monks slept, and a chapter house, where they\r\ntransacted business. There was also a library, a school, a hospital, and a\r\nguest house for the reception of strangers, besides barns, bakeries,\r\nlaundries, workshops, and storerooms for provisions. Beyond these\r\nbuildings lay vegetable gardens, orchards, grain fields, and often a mill,\r\nif the monastery was built on a stream. The high wall and ditch, usually\r\nsurrounding a monastery, shut it off from outsiders and in time of danger\r\nprotected it against attack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ABBEY OF SAINT GERMAIN DES PRÉS, PARIS\r\nThis celebrated monastery was founded in the sixth century. Of the\r\noriginal buildings only the abbey church remains. The illustration shows\r\nthe monastery as it was in 1361 A.D., with walls, towers, drawbridge, and\r\nmoat. Adjoining the church were the cloister, the refectory, and the\r\ndormitory.]\r\n\r\nMONASTIC OCCUPATIONS\r\n\r\nSt. Benedict defined a monastery as \"a school for the service of the\r\nLord.\" The monks under his Rule occupied themselves with a regular round\r\nof worship, reading, and manual labor. Each day was divided into seven\r\nsacred offices, beginning and ending with services in the monastery\r\nchurch. The first service came usually about two o'clock in the morning;\r\nthe last, just as evening set in, before the monks retired to rest. In\r\naddition to their attendance at church, the monks spent several hours in\r\nreading from the Bible, private prayer, and meditation. For most of the\r\nday, however, they worked hard with their hands, doing the necessary\r\nwashing and cooking for the monastery, raising the necessary supplies of\r\nvegetables and grain, and performing all the other tasks required to\r\nmaintain a large establishment. This emphasis on labor, as a religious\r\nduty, was a characteristic feature of western monasticism. \"To labor is to\r\npray\" became a favorite motto of the Benedictines. [22]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MONK COPYIST\r\nFrom a manuscript in the British Museum, London.]\r\n\r\nATTRACTIVENESS OF THE MONASTIC LIFE\r\n\r\nIt is clear that life in a Benedictine monastery appealed to many\r\ndifferent kinds of people in the Middle Ages. Those of a spiritual turn of\r\nmind found in the monastic life the opportunity of giving themselves\r\nwholly to God. Studious and thoughtful persons, with no disposition for an\r\nactive career in the world, naturally turned to the monastery as a secure\r\nretreat. The friendless and the disgraced often took refuge within its\r\nwalls. Many a troubled soul, to whom the trials of this world seemed\r\nunendurable, sought to escape from them by seeking the peaceful shelter of\r\nthe cloister.\r\n\r\nTHE MONKS AS CIVILIZERS\r\n\r\nThe civilizing influence of the Benedictine monks during the early Middle\r\nAges can scarcely be over-emphasized. A monastery was often at once a\r\nmodel farm, an inn, a hospital, a school, and a library. By the careful\r\ncultivation of their lands the monks set an example of good farming\r\nwherever they settled. They entertained pilgrims and travelers, at a\r\nperiod when western Europe was almost destitute of inns. They performed\r\nmany works of charity, feeding the hungry, healing the sick who were\r\nbrought to their doors, and distributing their medicines freely to those\r\nwho needed them. In their schools they trained both boys who wished to\r\nbecome priests and those who intended to lead active lives in the world.\r\nThe monks, too, were the only scholars of the age. By copying the\r\nmanuscripts of classical authors, they preserved valuable books that would\r\notherwise have been lost. By keeping records of the most striking events\r\nof their time, they acted as chroniclers of medieval history. To all these\r\nservices must be added the work of the monks as missionaries to the\r\nheathen peoples of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n126. SPREAD OF CHRISTIANITY OVER EUROPE\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN CHURCH AND THE BARBARIANS\r\n\r\nAlmost all Europe had been won to Christianity by the end of the eleventh\r\ncentury. In the direction of this great missionary campaign the Roman\r\nChurch took the leading part. [23] The officers of her armies were zealous\r\npopes, bishops, and abbots; her private soldiers were equally zealous\r\nmonks, priests, and laymen. Pagan Rome had never succeeded in making a\r\ncomplete and permanent conquest of the barbarians. Christian Rome,\r\nhowever, was able to bring them all under her spiritual sway.\r\n\r\nRECONVERSION OF THE ARIAN GERMANS\r\n\r\nChristianity first reached the Germanic invaders in its Arian [24] form.\r\nVisigoths, Ostrogoths, Vandals, Burgundians, and Lombards were all Arians.\r\nThe Roman Church regarded them as heretics and labored with success to\r\nreconvert them. This work was at last completed when the Lombards, in the\r\nseventh century, accepted the Catholic faith.\r\n\r\nFRANKS AND ANGLO-SAXONS CONVERTED TO ROMAN CATHOLICISM\r\n\r\nThe Franks and the Anglo-Saxons, whose kingdoms were to develop into the\r\nchief states of medieval Europe, adopted from the outset the Catholic form\r\nof Christianity. The conversion of the Franks provided the Roman Church\r\nwith its strongest and most faithful adherents among the Germanic tribes.\r\n[25] The conversion of Anglo-Saxon Britain by Augustine and his monks,\r\nfollowed later by the spread of Roman Catholicism in Ireland and Scotland,\r\nfirmly united the British Isles to the Papacy. [26] Thus Rome during the\r\nMiddle Ages came to be the one center of church life for the peoples of\r\nwestern Europe.\r\n\r\nST. BONIFACE AND THE CONVERSION OF THE GERMANS\r\n\r\nAn Anglo-Saxon monk, St. Boniface, did more than any other missionary to\r\ncarry Christianity to the remote tribes of Germany. Like Augustine in\r\nEngland, St. Boniface was sent by the pope, who created him missionary\r\nbishop and ordered him to \"carry the word of God to unbelievers.\" St.\r\nBoniface also enjoyed the support of the Frankish rulers, Charles Martel\r\nand Pepin the Short. Thanks to their assistance this intrepid monk was\r\nable to penetrate into the heart of Germany. Here he labored for nearly\r\nforty years, preaching, baptizing, and founding numerous churches,\r\nmonasteries, and schools. His boldness in attacking heathenism is\r\nillustrated by the story of how he cut down with his own hands a certain\r\noak tree, much reverenced by the natives of Hesse as sacred to the god\r\nWoden, and out of its wood built a chapel dedicated to St. Peter. St.\r\nBoniface crowned a lifetime of missionary labor with a martyr's death,\r\nprobably in 754 A.D. His work was continued by Charlemagne, who forced the\r\nSaxons to accept Christianity at the point of the sword. [27] All Germany\r\nat length became a Christian land, devoted to the Papacy.\r\n\r\nCONVERSION OF THE SLAVS\r\n\r\nRoman Catholicism not only spread to Celtic and Germanic peoples, but it\r\nalso gained a foothold among the Slavs. Both Henry the Fowler and Otto the\r\nGreat attempted to Christianize the Slavic tribes between the Elbe of the\r\nSlavs and the Vistula, by locating bishoprics in their territory. The work\r\nof conversion encountered many setbacks and did not reach completion until\r\nthe middle of the twelfth century. The most eminent missionaries to the\r\nSlavs were Cyril and Methodius. These brother-monks were sent from\r\nConstantinople in 863 A.D. to convert the Moravians, who formed a kingdom\r\non the eastern boundary of Germany. Seeing their great success as\r\nmissionaries, the pope invited them to Rome and secured their consent to\r\nan arrangement which brought the Moravian Christians under the control of\r\nthe Papacy. [28] From Moravia Christianity penetrated into Bohemia and\r\nPoland. These countries still remain strongholds of the Roman Church. The\r\nSerbians and Russians, as we have learned, [29] received Christianity by\r\nway of Constantinople and so became adherents of the Greek Church.\r\n\r\nFINAL EXTENSION OF ROMAN CATHOLICISM\r\n\r\nRoman Catholicism gradually spread to most of the remaining peoples of\r\nEurope. The conversion of the Norwegians and Swedes was well advanced by\r\nthe middle of the eleventh century. The Magyars, or Hungarians, accepted\r\nChristianity at about the same date. The king of Hungary was such a devout\r\nCatholic that in the year 1000 A.D. the pope sent to him a golden crown\r\nand saluted him as \"His Apostolic Majesty.\" The last parts of heathen\r\nEurope to receive the message of the gospel were the districts south and\r\neast of the Baltic, occupied by the Prussians, Lithuanians, and Finns.\r\nTheir conversion took place between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n127. SEPARATION OF EASTERN AND WESTERN CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nDIVERGENCE OF EAST AND WEST\r\n\r\nBefore the Christian conquest of Europe was finished, Christianity had\r\ndivided into two great communions--the Greek Church and the Roman Church.\r\nTheir separation was a long, slow process, arising from the deep-seated\r\ndifferences between East and West. Though Rome had carried her conquering\r\narms throughout the Mediterranean basin, all the region east of the\r\nAdriatic was imperfectly Romanized. [30] It remained Greek in language and\r\nculture, and tended, as time went on, to grow more and more unlike the\r\nWest, which was truly Roman. The founding of Constantinople and the\r\ntransference of the capital from the banks of the Tiber to the shores of\r\nthe Bosporus still further widened the breach between the two halves of\r\nthe Roman world. After the Germans established their kingdoms in Italy,\r\nSpain, Gaul, and Britain, western Europe was practically independent of\r\nthe rulers at Constantinople. The coronation of Charlemagne in 800 A.D.\r\nmarked the final severance of East and West.\r\n\r\nTHE PAPACY AND THE EASTERN EMPERORS\r\n\r\nThe division of the Roman Empire led naturally to a grouping of the\r\nChristian Church about Rome and Constantinople, the two chief centers of\r\ngovernment. The popes, it has been seen, had always enjoyed spiritual\r\nleadership in the West. In temporal matters they acknowledged the\r\nauthority of the eastern emperors, until the failure of the latter to\r\nprotect Rome and Italy from the barbarians showed clearly that the popes\r\nmust rely on their own efforts to defend Christian civilization. We have\r\nalready learned how well such men as Leo the Great and Gregory the Great\r\nperformed this task. Then in the eighth century came the alliance with the\r\nFrankish king, Pepin the Short, which gave the Papacy a powerful and\r\ngenerous protector beyond the Alps. Finally, by crowning Charlemagne, the\r\npope definitely broke with the emperor at Constantinople and transferred\r\nhis allegiance to the newly created western emperor.\r\n\r\nRISE OF THE PATRIARCHATE OF CONSTANTINOPLE\r\n\r\nThe patriarch of Constantinople, as bishop of the capital city, enjoyed an\r\nexcellent position from which to assert his preeminence over the bishops\r\nof the other churches in the East. Justinian in 550 A.D. conferred on him\r\nthe privilege of receiving appeals from the other patriarchs, and a few\r\nyears later that dignitary assumed the high-sounding title of \"Universal\r\nArchbishop.\" The authority of the patriarch of Constantinople was\r\nimmensely strengthened when the Mohammedans, having conquered Syria and\r\nEgypt, practically extinguished the three patriarchates of Antioch,\r\nJerusalem, and Alexandria. [31] The Church in the East now had a single\r\npatriarch, just as that in the West had the one bishop of Rome. Rivalry\r\nbetween them was inevitable.\r\n\r\nRIVALRY BETWEEN POPE AND PATRIARCH\r\n\r\nOne source of strife between pope and patriarch was the controversy,\r\narising in the eighth century, over the use of images in the churches.\r\nThese images seem to have been, not statues, but pictures (icons) of the\r\napostles, saints, and martyrs. Many eastern Christians sought to strip the\r\nchurches of icons, on the ground that by the ignorant they were venerated\r\nalmost as idols. The Iconoclasts (\"image-breakers\") gained no support in\r\nthe West. The Papacy took the view that images were a help to true\r\ndevotion and might, therefore, be allowed. When a Roman emperor issued a\r\ndecree for the destruction of all images, the pope refused to obey the\r\norder in the churches under his direction, and went so far as to exclude\r\nthe Iconoclasts from Christian fellowship. Although the iconoclastic\r\nmovement failed in the East, after a violent controversy, it helped still\r\nfurther to sharpen the antagonism between the two branches of Christendom.\r\nOther causes of dispute arose in later times, chiefly concerning fine\r\npoints of doctrine on which neither side would yield.\r\n\r\nTHE FINAL RUPTURE, 1054 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe final rupture of Christendom was delayed until the middle of the\r\neleventh century. In 1054 A.D. the pope sent his legates to Constantinople\r\nto demand obedience to the Papacy. This being refused, they laid upon the\r\nhigh altar of Sancta Sophia the pope's bill of excommunication. Against\r\nthe patriarch and his followers they pronounced a solemn curse, or\r\nanathema, devoting them \"to the eternal society of the Devil and his\r\nangels.\" Then, we are told, they strode out of Sancta Sophia, shaking the\r\ndust from their feet and crying, \"Let God see and judge.\" The two branches\r\nof the Christian Church, thus torn apart, were never afterward reunited.\r\n[32]\r\n\r\n\r\n128. THE GREEK CHURCH\r\n\r\nTHE GREEK AND ROMAN CHURCH COMPARED\r\n\r\nThe Greek and Roman churches, in some respects, are nearer together than\r\nRoman Catholicism and Protestantism. Both recognize three orders for the\r\nministry, namely, bishops, priests, and deacons. Priests of the Greek\r\nChurch may marry, but this privilege is not extended to bishops, who,\r\ntherefore, are chosen from the monks. Baptism, by both churches, is\r\nadministered to infants, but by the Greek Church under the form of total\r\nimmersion. Confirmation in the Greek Church follows immediately after\r\nbaptism; in the Roman Church it is postponed to the age of reason. In the\r\ncommunion service the Greek Church gives leavened bread, dipped in wine.\r\nThe Roman Church withholds wine from the laity and uses only a dry,\r\nunleavened wafer. While the services of the Roman Church are conducted in\r\nLatin, for those of the Greek Church the national languages (Greek,\r\nRussian, etc.) of the communicants are used. Its festivals do not coincide\r\nin time of celebration with those of the Roman Church, since the \"Julian\r\nCalendar\" followed in the East is now thirteen days behind the \"Gregorian\r\nCalendar.\" [33]\r\n\r\nSPREAD OF THE GREEK CHURCH\r\n\r\nThe Greek Church has not lacked missionary zeal. Through her agency the\r\nbarbarians who entered southeastern Europe during the early Middle Ages\r\nwere converted to Christianity. At the present time nearly all the peoples\r\nof the Balkan peninsula, including Greeks, Montenegrins, Serbians,\r\nBulgarians, and Rumanians, belong to the Greek Church. [34] Its greatest\r\nvictory was won toward the close of the tenth century, when the Russians\r\nwere induced to accept the Greek form of Christianity. Outlying branches\r\nof the Greek Church are found also in the Turkish Empire. It now includes\r\nabout one hundred and thirty-five million adherents in European lands.\r\n\r\nPRESENT ORGANIZATION OF THE GREEK CHURCH\r\n\r\nThe patriarch of Constantinople is the spiritual head of the Greek Church.\r\nHe enjoys, however, no such wide authority over eastern Christians as that\r\nexercised by the pope over all Roman Catholics. There are as many as\r\nsixteen branches of the Greek Church, each self-governing and under its\r\nown officers. Despite the local independence of its branches, the Greek\r\nChurch remains unified in doctrine. It claims to be the only \"Orthodox\"\r\nchurch and clings with almost Oriental conservatism to the traditions of\r\nearlier ages. Nevertheless, as the official church of Russia, the largest\r\nand most swiftly growing of European countries, the Greek Church has\r\nbefore it a future of great importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n129. THE ROMAN CHURCH\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN CHURCH PROGRESSIVE\r\n\r\nThe separation of eastern and western Christianity naturally increased the\r\nimportance of the Papacy. The popes henceforth had a free hand to guide\r\nthe destinies of the Roman Church. That church under their direction was\r\nto show itself vigorous and progressive, with a wonderful power of\r\nadaptation to new and changed conditions.\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN CHURCH SURVIVES THE EMPIRE\r\n\r\nThe Roman Empire in the West had gone down before the assaults of the\r\nGermanic barbarians, but in its place had arisen a new creation--the Roman\r\nChurch. The chief city of the old empire became the capital of the Papacy.\r\nThe pope took, and has since retained, the title of Supreme Pontiff\r\n(_Pontifex Maximus_), once given to the head of the Roman state religion.\r\n[35] Latin has continued to be the official language of Roman Catholicism.\r\nThe Roman genius for law and government found a new expression in the\r\ncreation of the papal power. The true successors of the ancient Roman\r\nstatesmen were the popes of the Middle Ages. The idea of Rome, of her\r\nuniversality and of her eternity, lived on in the Roman Church.\r\n\r\nWORK OF THE ROMAN CHURCH\r\n\r\nThe Roman Church, as the successor of the Roman Empire in the West, formed\r\nthe chief center of civilization during the earlier part of the Middle\r\nAges. She stood between the conquering Germans and the Romanized\r\nprovincials and helped to join them both in lasting union. To the heathen\r\nshe sent out her missionaries, preaching a religion of love and charity\r\nand introducing a higher morality than the barbarians had ever known\r\nbefore. She multiplied hospitals, orphanages, and asylums. Her bishops\r\nwere the only protectors of the weak and the oppressed. She fostered\r\neducation, art, and learning within the walls of churches and monasteries.\r\nHer priests and monks were the only teachers in an ignorant age. In an age\r\nof bloodshed and violence, when might made right, she proclaimed the\r\nsuperiority of the spirit to mere brute force. To sum up: the Roman Church\r\nwas an indispensable agent in the making of medieval Europe.\r\n\r\nTHE MENACE TO CHRISTENDOM\r\n\r\nChristianity in its Greek and Roman forms was not the only great religion\r\nof the Middle Ages. In the seventh century, before the separation of the\r\ntwo churches had been completed and before all Europe had become\r\nChristian, another religion arose. It grew with marvelous rapidity,\r\nstripped the Church of much territory in western Asia, northern Africa,\r\nand Spain, and promised for a time to become the dominant faith of the\r\nworld. This was Islam, or Mohammedanism, the religion of the Arabs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

ARABIA AND THE ARABS\r\n\r\nTHE ARABIAN PENINSULA\r\n\r\nArabia, a vast peninsula between the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, and\r\nthe Red Sea, forms the link between Asia and Africa. It is connected with\r\nAsia by the arid plains extending northward to the Euphrates; with Africa,\r\nby the equally arid isthmus of Suez. Though the country is more than one-\r\nthird the size of the United States (excluding Alaska), it has never\r\nsupported a large population. The interior, except for occasional oases,\r\nis a desert, inhabited only by wandering tribes. Along the southern and\r\nwestern coasts, between the mountains and the sea, the soil is generally\r\nfertile, the climate temperate, and the rainfall sufficient. Here the\r\nchief cities and towns are located.\r\n\r\nINHABITANTS OF ARABIA\r\n\r\nThe original home of the Semites is believed to have been Arabia. Some\r\nSemitic peoples appear to have migrated northward to Babylonia and Syria,\r\nwhile others crossed the Red Sea to Abyssinia. Physically, the Arabs are\r\nan attractive people, with well-shaped, muscular figures, handsome,\r\nbronzed faces, brilliant, black eyes, and all the organs of sense\r\nexquisitely acute. Simple and abstemious in their habits, they lead\r\nhealthy lives and often reach an extreme yet vigorous old age.\r\n\r\nTHE BEDOUINS OF THE DESERT\r\n\r\nThe Bedouin Arabs, by which name the nomadic inhabitants of the desert are\r\nknown, claim Ishmael, the son of Abraham and half-brother of Isaac, as\r\ntheir ancestor. The life which they lead in the Arabian wilderness closely\r\nresembles that of the Hebrew patriarchs, as described in the Old\r\nTestament. The Bedouins are shepherds and herdsmen, continually moving\r\nwith their sheep and camels from one pasturage and water-hole to another.\r\nTheir virtues--hospitality to the stranger, generosity, faithfulness to\r\nthe ties of kinship--are those of a nomadic, barbarian people. Such also\r\nare their vices--love of fighting and plunder, revengefulness, and\r\nimpatience of restraint. Nothing like a settled government is known to\r\nthem. The only tribal authority is that of the chief, or \"sheik,\" who,\r\nbecause of his birth, courage, or wealth, has been chosen to the\r\nleadership. This description of the Bedouins to-day applies equally well\r\nto them in the age of Mohammed, during the sixth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MECCA\r\nThe chief sanctuary of Mecca is the building called the Kaaba, which lies\r\nin the center of a vast courtyard surrounded by a colonnade. The Kaaba is\r\nhere seen covered with a heavy black cloth renewed each year. Pilgrims\r\nenter the courtyard, walk slowly around the Kaaba seven times--seven is a\r\nholy number in Islam--and kiss the sacred black stone fixed in the walls\r\nof the structure. The stone is now broken into pieces, which are kept\r\ntogether by a silver setting. The Kaaba has been rebuilt several times\r\nsince the days of Mohammed, but it still preserves the old form of a\r\nheathen temple.]\r\n\r\nTHE SEDENTARY ARABS\r\n\r\nThe Arabs who settled along the southern and western coasts of the\r\npeninsula had reached in the sixth century a considerable degree of\r\ncivilization. They practiced agriculture and carried on a flourishing\r\ntrade across the Red Sea and even to distant India. Between these\r\nsedentary Arabs and the Bedouins raged constant feuds, leading to much\r\npetty warfare. Nevertheless the hundreds of tribes throughout the\r\npeninsula preserved a feeling of national unity, which was greatly\r\nstrengthened by Mohammed's appearance on the scene.\r\n\r\nARABIAN HEATHENISM\r\n\r\nThe city of Mecca, located about fifty miles from the Red Sea, was a\r\ncommercial metropolis and the center of Arabian heathenism. Every year the\r\nArab tribes ceased fighting for four months, and went up to Mecca to buy\r\nand sell and visit the famous sanctuary called the Kaaba. Here were three\r\nhundred and sixty idols and a small, black stone (probably a meteorite),\r\nwhich legend declared had been brought from heaven. The stone was\r\noriginally white, but the sins of the people who touched it had blackened\r\nit. Although most of the Arabs were idolaters, yet some of them recognized\r\nthe \"Unknown God\" of the Semites, Allah, the Creator of all things. Arabia\r\nat this time contained many Jews, Zoroastrians, and Christians, who helped\r\nto spread abroad the conception of one God and thus to prepare the way for\r\na prophet of a new religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n131. MOHAMMED: PROPHET AND STATESMAN, 622-632 A.D.\r\n\r\nEARLY LIFE OF MOHAMMED\r\n\r\nMohammed, [2] born at Mecca about 570 A.D., belonged to the tribe of the\r\nKoreish, who had long been guardians of the sacred Kaaba. Left an orphan\r\nat an early age, the future prophet was obliged to earn his own living. He\r\nserved first as a shepherd on the hillsides of Mecca. This occupation,\r\nthough lowly, gave him the love of solitude, and helped to nourish in his\r\nsoul that appreciation of nature which later found expression in so many\r\nof his utterances. While still a youth he became a camel-driver and twice\r\ncrossed the deserts with caravans to Syria. Doubtless he made many\r\nacquaintances on these journeys and picked up much useful information.\r\nMohammed, however, did not receive a regular education; it is doubtful\r\nwhether he could read or write. His marriage, when about twenty-five years\r\nof age, to a rich widow, named Khadija, brought him wealth and\r\nconsideration. For some time, henceforth, he led the life of a prosperous\r\nmerchant of Mecca.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LETTER OF MOHAMMED\r\nA letter, probably in the handwriting of Mohammed's secretary, addressed\r\nto the governor of Alexandria. The seal is inscribed \"Mohammed, the\r\nprophet of God.\"]\r\n\r\nMOHAMMED'S VISIONS\r\n\r\nMohammed seems always to have been a deeply religious man. As he grew\r\nolder, his thoughts more and more centered on spiritual themes. He could\r\nnot reconcile the gross idolatry of the Arabs with that belief in the\r\nunity of God which he himself had reached. In his distress he would\r\nwithdraw into the wilderness, where he spent much time in fasting and\r\nsolitary vigils, practices perhaps suggested to him by the example of\r\nChristian hermits. [3] During these lonely hours in the desert strange\r\nscenes passed before his eyes and strange voices sounded in his ears. At\r\nfirst Mohammed thought that evil spirits possessed him, but Khadija\r\nencouraged him to believe that his visions were a revelation from another\r\nworld. One day, so he declared, God's messenger, the archangel Gabriel,\r\nappeared to him and bade him preach a new religion to the Arabs. It was\r\nvery simple, but in its simplicity lay its strength: \"There is no god but\r\nGod, and Mohammed is the prophet of God.\"\r\n\r\nTHE HEGIRA, 622 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe prophet made his first converts in his wife, his children, and the\r\nfriends who knew him best. Then, becoming bolder, he began to preach\r\npublicly in Mecca. In spite of Mohammed's eloquence, obvious sincerity,\r\nand attractive personality, he met a discouraging reception. A few slaves\r\nand poor freemen became his followers, but most of the citizens of Mecca\r\nregarded him as a madman. Mohammed's disciples, called Moslems, [4] were\r\nbitterly persecuted by the Koreish, who resented the prophet's attacks on\r\nidolatry and feared the loss of their privileges at the Kaaba. Finally\r\nMohammed and his converts took refuge in Medina, where some of the\r\ninhabitants had already accepted his teachings. This was the famous Hegira\r\n(Flight of the prophet). [5]\r\n\r\nLATER LIFE OF MOHAMMED\r\n\r\nAt Medina Mohammed occupied a position of high honor and influence. The\r\npeople welcomed him gladly and made him their chief magistrate. As his\r\nadherents increased in number, Mohammed began to combine fighting with\r\npreaching. His military expeditions against the Arab tribes proved to be\r\nvery successful. Many of the conquered Bedouins enlisted under his banner\r\nand in 630 A.D. captured Mecca for the prophet. He treated its inhabitants\r\nleniently, but threw down all the idols in the Kaaba, After the submission\r\nof Mecca most of the Arabs abandoned idolatry and accepted the new\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF MOHAMMED, 632 A.D.\r\n\r\nMohammed did not long enjoy his position as uncrowned king of Arabia. He\r\ndied in 632 A.D., at Medina, where he was buried and where his tomb is\r\nstill visited by pious Moslems. His followers could scarcely believe that\r\ntheir great prophet had gone away from them forever. They were ready to\r\nworship him as a god, until old Abu Bekr, Mohammed's father-in-law,\r\nrebuked them with the memorable words: \"Whoso worshipeth Mohammed, let him\r\nknow that Mohammed is dead; but whoso worshipeth God, let him know that\r\nGod liveth and dieth not.\"\r\n\r\nMOHAMMED'S CHARACTER\r\n\r\nThe character of Mohammed has been variously estimated. Moslem writers\r\nmake him a saint; Christian writers, until Mohammed's recent times, have\r\ncalled him an \"impostor.\" We know that he was a man of simple habits, who,\r\neven in the days of his prosperity, lived on dates, barley bread, and\r\nwater, mended his woolen garments, and attended to his own wants. He was\r\nmild and gentle, a lover of children, devoted to his friends, and\r\nforgiving toward his foes. He seems to have won the admiration of all with\r\nwhom he came in contact. We know, too, that Mohammed was so deeply\r\nimpressed with the consciousness of his religious mission that he was\r\nready to give up wealth and an honorable position and face for years the\r\nridicule and hatred of the people of Mecca. His faults--deceitfulness,\r\nsuperstitiousness, sensuality--were those of the Arabs of his time. Their\r\nexistence in Mohammed's character should not prevent our recognition of\r\nhis real greatness as a prophet and as a statesman.\r\n\r\n\r\n132. ISLAM AND THE KORAN\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF THE KORAN\r\n\r\nThe religion which Mohammed preached is called Islam, an Arabic word\r\nmeaning \"surrender,\" or \"resignation.\" This religion has its sacred book,\r\nthe Koran (\"thing read\" or \"thing recited\"). It contains the speeches,\r\nprayers, and other utterances of Mohammed at various times during his\r\ncareer. Some parts of the Koran were dictated by the prophet to his\r\ndisciples and by them were written out on skins, leaves of palm trees,\r\nbones, and bits of parchment. Many other parts remained at first only in\r\nthe memory of Mohammed's followers. Soon after his death all the scattered\r\npassages were collected into one book. Since the middle of the seventh\r\ncentury the Koran, every word of which the Moslems consider holy, has\r\nremained unchanged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PASSAGE FROM THE KORAN\r\nFrom a manuscript in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.]\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS TEACHINGS OF THE KORAN\r\n\r\nThe doctrines found in the Koran show many adaptations from the Jewish and\r\nChristian religions. Like them Islam emphasizes the unity of God. The\r\nMoslem cry--\"_Allah Akbar!_\" \"God is Great!\"--forms its cardinal\r\nprinciple. Like them, also, Islam recognizes the existence of prophets,\r\nincluding Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, but insists that Mohammed was the\r\nlast and greatest of the prophets. The existence of angels and demons is\r\nrecognized. The chief of the demons, Iblis, bears some resemblance to the\r\nJewish Satan and the Christian Devil. The account of the creation and fall\r\nof man is taken, with variations, from the Old Testament. The description\r\nof the resurrection of the dead, the last judgment, and the division of\r\nthe future world into paradise and hell, the former for believers in\r\nIslam, the latter for those who have refused to accept it, seems to have\r\nbeen based on Persian and Jewish ideas. These borrowings from other\r\nreligions facilitated the spread of Islam among eastern peoples.\r\n\r\nOBSERVANCES OF ISLAM\r\n\r\nThe Koran imposes on the faithful Moslem five great obligations. First, he\r\nmust recite, at least once in his life, aloud, correctly, and with full\r\nunderstanding, the short creed: \"There is no god but God, and Mohammed is\r\nthe prophet of God.\" Second, he must pray five times a day: at dawn, just\r\nafter noon, before sunset, just after sunset, and at the end of the day.\r\nIn every Mohammedan city the hour of prayer is announced from the tall\r\nminaret of the mosque by a crier (_muezzin_). Before engaging in prayer\r\nthe worshiper washes face, hands, and feet; during the prayer he turns\r\ntoward Mecca and bows his head to the ground. Third, he must observe a\r\nstrict fast, from morning to night, during every day of _Ramadan_, the\r\nninth month of the Mohammedan year. [6] In this month God presented the\r\nKoran to Gabriel for revelation to the prophet. Fourth, he must give alms\r\nto the poor. Fifth, he must, \"if he is able,\" undertake at least one\r\npilgrimage to Mecca. The annual visit of thousands of pilgrims to the holy\r\ncity helps to preserve the feeling of brotherhood among Moslems all over\r\nthe world. These five obligations are the \"pillars\" of Islam.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF ISLAM\r\n\r\nAs a religious system Islam is exceedingly simple. It does not provide any\r\nelaborate ceremonies of worship and permits no altars, pictures, or images\r\nin the mosque. Islam even lacks a priesthood. Every Moslem acts as his own\r\npriest. There is, however, an official, who on Friday, the Mohammedan\r\nSabbath, offers up public prayers in the mosque and delivers a sermon to\r\nthe assembled worshipers. All work is suspended during this service, but\r\nat its close secular activities are resumed.\r\n\r\nMORAL TEACHINGS OF THE KORAN\r\n\r\nThe Koran furnishes a moral code for the adherents of Islam. It contains a\r\nfew important prohibitions. The Moslem is not to make images, to engage in\r\ngames of chance, to eat pork, or to drink wine. This last prohibition has\r\nsaved the Mohammedan world from the degradation and misery which alcohol\r\nhas introduced into Christian lands. To Mohammed strong drink was \"the\r\nmother of all evil,\" and drunkenness, a sin. The Koran also inculcates\r\nmany active virtues, including reverence toward parents, protection of\r\nwidows and orphans, charity toward the poor, kindness to slaves, and\r\ngentle treatment of the lower animals. On the whole it must be admitted\r\nthat the laws of the Koran did much to restrain the vices of the Arabs and\r\nto provide them with higher standards of right and wrong. Islam marked a\r\ngreat advance over Arabian heathenism.\r\n\r\n\r\n133. EXPANSION OF ISLAM IN ASIA AND EGYPT\r\n\r\nISLAM SPREAD BY THE SWORD\r\n\r\nMohammed, as we have learned, did not scruple to use the sword as a means\r\nof spreading his new religion among the idolatrous Arab tribes. By thus\r\nfollowing up preaching with force, he subdued the greater part of Arabia.\r\nThe prophet's methods were adopted by his successors. Within a century\r\nafter Mohammed's death, they carried the doctrines of Islam over a large\r\npart of the civilized world and founded an Arabian Empire.\r\n\r\nISLAM AS A RELIGION OF CONQUEST\r\n\r\nIslam was a religion of conquest. It proclaimed the righteousness of a\r\n\"holy war,\" or _jihad_, against unbelievers. It promised rich booty for\r\nthose who fought and won, and paradise for those who fell. The Arab\r\nsoldier, dying on the battlefield, expected to be carried away by bright-\r\neyed maidens to a garden of delight, where, reclining on soft cushions and\r\nrugs, he was to enjoy forever an existence of sensual ease. \"Whosoever\r\nfalls in battle,\" so runs a passage in the Koran, \"his sins are forgiven,\r\nand at the day of judgment his limbs shall be supplied by the wings of\r\nangels and cherubim.\"\r\n\r\nISLAM AS A POLITICAL FORCE\r\n\r\nThe sudden creation of the Arabian power must not be understood, however,\r\nas solely a religious movement. Pride and greed, as well as fanaticism,\r\ndrove the Arabs forward on their conquering career. Long before Mohammed's\r\ntime Arabia had been in a state of unrest. Its warlike tribes, feeling a\r\nsense of their superiority to other peoples, were eager to overrun the\r\nrich districts of western Asia, much as the Germans had overrun western\r\nEurope. Islam strengthened the racial pride of the Arabs, united them into\r\none nation, and gave them an effective organization for world-wide rule.\r\n\r\nARAB CONQUESTS IN THE EAST, 632-642 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe most extensive conquests of the Arabs were made within ten years after\r\nMohammed's death. During this time the Moslem warriors, though poorly\r\narmed, ill-disciplined, and in every battle greatly outnumbered, attacked\r\nwith success the two strongest military powers then in the world--Rome and\r\nPersia. From the Roman Empire in the East they seized the provinces of\r\nSyria and Palestine, with the famous cities of Damascus, Antioch, and\r\nJerusalem. [7] They took Mesopotamia from the Persians and then, invading\r\nIran, overthrew the Persian power. [8] Egypt also was subjugated by these\r\nirresistible soldiers of the Crescent.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF THE CONQUERED PEOPLES\r\n\r\nAccording to the strict teaching of the Koran, those who refused to accept\r\nIslam were either to be killed or to be reduced to slavery. As a matter of\r\nfact, the Arabs treated their new subjects with marked liberality. No\r\nmassacres and no persecutions occurred. The conquered peoples were allowed\r\nto retain their own religions, on condition of paying ample tribute. In\r\ncourse of time, however, many of the Christians in Syria and Egypt and\r\nmost of the Zoroastrians [9] in Persia adopted Islam, in order that they\r\nmight acquire the rights and privileges of Moslem citizens.\r\n\r\nLATER ARAB CONQUESTS\r\n\r\nThe sweeping conquests of the decade 632-642 A.D. were followed in later\r\nyears by a further extension of the boundaries of the Arabian Empire. In\r\nthe remote East the Arabs sent their victorious armies beyond the Oxus and\r\nIndus rivers to central Asia and India. They captured the island of\r\nCyprus, annexed parts of Armenia and Asia Minor, and at length threatened\r\nto take Constantinople. Had that city fallen, all eastern Europe would\r\nhave been laid open to invasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, EXPANSION OF ISLAM]\r\n\r\nSIEGE OF CONSTANTINOPLE, 716-717 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe first attempts on Constantinople were made by sea and were repulsed,\r\nbut during the years 716-717 A.D. the city had to face a combined attack\r\nby a Moslem navy and army. The eastern emperor, Leo the Isaurian,\r\nconducted a heroic defense, using with much effectiveness the celebrated\r\nmixture known as \"Greek fire.\" This combustible, probably composed of\r\nsulphur, naphtha, and quicklime, was poured or hurled on the enemy's ships\r\nin order to burn them. \"Greek fire,\" the rigors of an uncommonly severe\r\nwinter, and timely aid from the Bulgarians at length compelled the Arabs\r\nto beat a retreat. Their failure to take Constantinople gave the Roman\r\nEmpire in the East another long lease of life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAVAL BATTLE SHOWING USE OF \"GREEK FIRE\"\r\nFrom a Byzantine manuscript of the fourteenth century at Madrid. \"Greek\r\nfire\" in marine warfare was most commonly propelled through long tubes of\r\ncopper which were placed on the prow of a ship and managed by a gunner.\r\nCombustibles might also be kept in tubes flung by hand and exploded on\r\nboard the enemy's vessel.]\r\n\r\n\r\n134. EXPANSION OF ISLAM IN NORTH AFRICA AND SPAIN\r\n\r\nNORTH AFRICA SUBDUED\r\n\r\nThough repulsed before the impregnable walls of Constantinople, the Arabs\r\ncontinued to win new dominions in other North Africa parts of the\r\nChristian world. After their occupation of Egypt, they began to overrun\r\nNorth Africa, which Justinian, little more than a century earlier, had\r\nreconquered from the Vandals. [10] The Romanized provincials, groaning\r\nunder the burdensome taxes imposed on them by the eastern emperors, made\r\nonly a slight resistance to the Moslem armies. A few of the great cities\r\nheld out for a time, but after the capture and destruction of Carthage\r\n[11] in 698 A.D., Arab rule was soon established over the whole extent of\r\nthe Mediterranean coast from Egypt to the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nARABS AND BERBERS\r\n\r\nIslam made in North Africa one of its most permanent conquests. After the\r\ncoming of the Arabs many of the Christian inhabitants appear to have\r\nwithdrawn to Spain and Sicily, leaving the field clear for the\r\nintroduction of Arabian civilization. The Arabs who settled in North\r\nAfrica gave their religion and government to the Berbers, as the natives\r\nof the country were called, and to some extent intermingled with them.\r\nArabs and Berbers still comprise the population of North Africa, though\r\ntheir once independent states have now been absorbed by European powers.\r\n[12]\r\n\r\nSUBJUGATION OF SPAIN BEGUN, 711 A.D.\r\n\r\nWith North Africa in their hands the Moslems did not long delay the\r\ninvasion of Spain. In 711 A.D. an army of Arabs and Berbers, under their\r\nleader Tarik, crossed the strait which still bears his name [13] and for\r\nthe first time confronted the Germans. The Visigothic kingdom, [14]\r\nalready much enfeebled, proved to be an easy prey. A single battle made\r\nthe invaders masters of half of Spain. Within a few years their hosts\r\nswept northward to the Pyrenees. Only small districts in the northern part\r\nof the Spanish peninsula remained unconquered.\r\n\r\nTHE MOSLEM ADVANCE IN GAUL\r\n\r\nThe Moslems were not stopped by the Pyrenees. Crossing these mountains,\r\nthey captured many of the old Roman cities in the south of Gaul and then\r\nadvanced to the north, attracted, apparently, by the booty to be found in\r\nChristian monasteries and churches. In the vicinity of Tours they\r\nencountered the great army which Charles Martel, the chief minister of the\r\nFrankish king, [15] had collected to oppose their advance.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF TOURS, 732 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Tours seems to have continued for several days. Of its\r\ndetails we know nothing, though a Spanish chronicler tells us that the\r\nheavy infantry of the Franks stood \"immovable as a wall, inflexible as a\r\nblock of ice\" against the desperate assaults of the Moslem horsemen. When\r\nthe Franks, after the last day's fighting, wished to renew the struggle,\r\nthey found that the enemy had fled, leaving a camp filled with the spoils\r\nof war. This engagement, though famous in history, was scarcely decisive.\r\nFor some time afterward the Moslems maintained themselves in southern\r\nGaul. It was the Frankish ruler, Pepin the Short, who annexed their\r\npossessions there and drove them back across the Pyrenees to Spain. [16]\r\n\r\n\r\n135. THE CALIPHATE AND ITS DISRUPTION, 632-1058 A.D.\r\n\r\nTHE FOUR \"ORTHODOX\" CALIPHS, 632-661 A.D.\r\n\r\nOnly eighteen years after the battle of Tours, the Arabian Empire was\r\ndivided into two rival and more or less hostile parts, which came to be\r\ncalled the Eastern and Western caliphates. The title of caliph, meaning\r\n\"successor\" or \"representative,\" had first been assumed by Mohammed's\r\nfather-in-law, Abu Bekr, who was chosen to succeed the prophet as the\r\ncivil and religious head of the Moslem world. After him followed Omar, who\r\nhad been one of Mohammed's most faithful adherents, and then Othman and\r\nAli, both sons-in-law of Mohammed. These four rulers are sometimes known\r\nas the \"Orthodox\" caliphs, because their right to the succession was\r\nuniversally acknowledged by Moslems.\r\n\r\nOMMIAD CALIPHS AT DAMASCUS, 661-750 A.D.\r\n\r\nAfter Ali's death the governor of Syria, Moawiya by name, succeeded in\r\nmaking himself caliph of the Moslem world. This usurper converted the\r\ncaliphate into a hereditary, instead of an elective, office, and\r\nestablished the dynasty of the Ommiads. [17] Their capital was no longer\r\nMedina in Arabia, but the Syrian city of Damascus. The descendants of\r\nMohammed's family refused, however, to recognize the Ommiads as legitimate\r\ncaliphs. In 750 A.D. a sudden revolt, headed by the party of the Abbasids,\r\n[18] established a new dynasty. The Abbasids treacherously murdered nearly\r\nall the members of the Ommiad family, but one survivor escaped to Spain,\r\nwhere he founded at Cordova an independent Ommiad dynasty. [19] North\r\nAfrica, also, before long separated itself from Abbasid rule. Thus the\r\nonce united caliphate, like the old Roman Empire, split in twain.\r\n\r\nTHE ABBASID CALIPHS, 750-1058 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Abbasids continued to reign over the Moslems in Asia for more than\r\nthree hundred years. The most celebrated of Abbasid caliphs was Harun-al-\r\nRashid (Aaron the Just), a contemporary of Charlemagne, to whom the Arab\r\nruler sent several presents, including an elephant and a water-clock which\r\nstruck the hours. The tales of Harun-al-Rashid's magnificence, his gold\r\nand silver, his silks and gems, his rugs and tapestries, reflect the\r\nluxurious life of the Abbasid rulers. Gradually, however, their power\r\ndeclined, and in 1058 A.D. the Seljuk Turks, [20] recent converts to\r\nIslam, deprived them of their power. A Turkish chieftain, with the title\r\nof \"King of the East and West,\" then took the place of the Arabian caliph,\r\nthough the latter remained the religious head of Islam. He lost even this\r\nspiritual authority, just two centuries later, when the Mongols from\r\ncentral Asia overran the Turkish dominions. [21]\r\n\r\nBAGDAD\r\n\r\nThe Abbasids removed their capital from Damascus to Bagdad on the banks of\r\nthe middle Euphrates. The new city, under the fostering care of the\r\ncaliphs, grew with great rapidity. Its population in the ninth century is\r\nsaid to have reached two millions. For a time it was the largest and\r\nrichest city in the Moslem world. How its splendor impressed the\r\nimagination may be seen from the stories of the _Thousand and One Nights_.\r\n[22] After the extinction of the Abbasid caliphate, its importance as the\r\nreligious and political center of Islam declined. But memories of the\r\nformer grandeur of Bagdad still cling to it, and even to-day it is\r\nreferred to in Turkish official documents as the \"glorious city.\"\r\n\r\nEXTINCTION OF THE ARABIAN EMPIRE A MISFORTUNE\r\n\r\nIt was a very great misfortune for the eastern world when the Arabian\r\nEmpire passed under the control of rude Asiatic peoples. The Turks\r\naccepted Islam, but they did little to preserve and extend Arabian\r\ncivilization. The stagnant, non-progressive condition of the East at the\r\npresent time is largely due to the misgovernment of its Turkish\r\nconquerors.\r\n\r\n\r\n136. ARABIAN CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nTHE ARABS AS ABSORBERS OF CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nThe great Moslem cities of Bagdad, Damascus, Cairo, and Cordova were not\r\nonly seats of government for the different divisions of the Arabian\r\nEmpire; they were also the centers of Arabian civilization. The conquests\r\nof the Arabs had brought them into contact with highly developed peoples\r\nwhose culture they absorbed and to some extent improved. They owed most to\r\nPersia and, after Persia, to Greece, through the empire at Constantinople,\r\nIn their hands there was somewhat the same fusion of East and West as\r\nAlexander the Great had sought to accomplish. [23] Greek science and\r\nphilosophy mingled with the arts of Persia and other Oriental lands.\r\nArabian civilization, for about four centuries under the Ommiad and\r\nAbbasid caliphs, far surpassed anything to be found in western Europe.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nMany improvements in agriculture were due to the Arabs. They had a good\r\nsystem of irrigation, practiced rotation of crops, employed fertilizers,\r\nand understood how to graft and produce new varieties of plants and\r\nfruits. From the Arabs we have received cotton, flax, hemp, buckwheat,\r\nrice, sugar cane, and coffee, various vegetables, including asparagus,\r\nartichokes, and beans, and such fruits as melons, oranges, lemons,\r\napricots, and plums.\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURING\r\n\r\nThe Arabs excelled in various manufactures. Damascus was famous for its\r\nbrocades, tapestries, and blades of tempered steel. The Moorish cities in\r\nSpain had also their special productions: Cordova, leather; Toledo, armor;\r\nand Granada, rich silks. Arab craftsmen taught the Venetians to make\r\ncrystal and plate glass. The work of Arab potters and weavers was at once\r\nthe admiration and despair of its imitators in western Europe. The Arabs\r\nknew the secrets of dyeing and they made a kind of paper. Their textile\r\nfabrics and articles of metal were distinguished for beauty of design and\r\nperfection of workmanship. European peoples during the early Middle Ages\r\nreceived the greater part of their manufactured articles of luxury through\r\nthe Arabs. [24]\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE\r\n\r\nThe products of Arab farms and workshops were carried far and wide\r\nthroughout medieval lands. The Arabs were keen merchants, and Mohammed had\r\nexpressly encouraged commerce by declaring it agreeable to God. The Arabs\r\ntraded with India, China, the East Indies (Java and Sumatra), the interior\r\nof Africa, Russia, and even with the Baltic lands. Bagdad, which commanded\r\nboth land and water routes, was the chief center of this commerce, but\r\nother cities of western Asia, North Africa, and Spain shared in its\r\nadvantages. The bazaar, or merchants' quarter, was found in every Moslem\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE\r\n\r\nThe trade of the Arabs, their wide conquests, and their religious\r\npilgrimages to Mecca vastly increased their knowledge of the world. They\r\nwere the best geographers of the Middle Ages. An Abbasid caliph, the son\r\nof Harun-al-Rashid, had the Greek _Geography_ of Ptolemy [25] translated\r\ninto Arabic and enriched the work with illuminated maps. Arab scholars\r\ncompiled encyclopedias describing foreign countries and peoples,\r\nconstructed celestial spheres, and measured closely the arc of the\r\nmeridian in order to calculate the size of the earth. There is some reason\r\nto believe that the mariner's compass was first introduced into Europe by\r\nthe Arabs. The geographical knowledge of Christian peoples during the\r\nMiddle Ages owed much, indeed, to their Moslem forerunners.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\nSchools and universities flourished in Moslem lands when Christian Europe\r\nwas still in the \"Dark Ages.\" The largest institution of learning was at\r\nCairo, where the lectures of the professors were attended by thousands of\r\nstudents. Famous universities also existed in Bagdad and Cordova. Moslem\r\nscholars especially delighted in the study of philosophy. Arabic\r\ntranslations of Aristotle's [26] writings made the ideas of that great\r\nthinker familiar to the students of western Europe, where the knowledge of\r\nGreek had all but died out. The Arabs also formed extensive libraries of\r\nmany thousands of manuscripts, all carefully arranged and catalogued.\r\nTheir libraries and universities, especially in Spain, were visited by\r\nmany Christians, who thus became acquainted with Moslem learning and\r\nhelped to introduce it into Europe.\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY AND MEDICINE\r\n\r\nThe Arabs have been considered to be the founders of modern experimental\r\nscience. They were relatively skillful chemists, for they discovered a\r\nnumber of new compounds (such as alcohol, aqua regia, nitric acid, and\r\ncorrosive sublimate) and understood the preparation of mercury and of\r\nvarious oxides of metals. In medicine the Arabs based their investigations\r\non those of the Greeks, [27] but made many additional contributions to the\r\nart of healing. They studied physiology and hygiene, dissected the human\r\nbody, performed difficult surgical operations, used anaesthetics, and\r\nwrote treatises on such diseases as measles and smallpox. Arab medicine\r\nand surgery were studied by the Christian peoples of Europe throughout the\r\nlater period of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE MOSQUE OF CORDOVA\r\nThe great mosque of Cordova, begun in the eighth century, was gradually\r\nenlarged during the following centuries to its present dimensions, 570 by\r\n425 feet. The building, one of the largest in the world, has now been\r\nturned into a cathedral. The most striking feature of the interior is the\r\nforest of porphyry, jasper, and marble pillars supporting open Moorish\r\narches. Originally there were 1200 of these pillars, but many have been\r\ndestroyed.]\r\n\r\nMATHEMATICS AND ASTRONOMY\r\n\r\nThe Arabs had a strong taste for mathematics. Here again they carried\r\nfurther the old Greek investigations. In arithmetic they used the so-\r\ncalled \"Arabic\" figures, which were probably borrowed from India. The\r\nArabic numerals gradually supplanted in western Europe the awkward Roman\r\nnumerals. In geometry the Arabs added little to Euclid, but algebra is\r\npractically their creation. An Arabic treatise on algebra long formed the\r\ntextbook of the subject in the universities of Christian Europe. Spherical\r\ntrigonometry and conic sections are Arabic inventions. This mathematical\r\nknowledge enabled the Arabs to make considerable progress in astronomy.\r\nObservatories at Bagdad and Damascus were erected as early as the ninth\r\ncentury. Some of the astronomical instruments which they constructed,\r\nincluding the sextant and the gnomon, are still in use. [28]\r\n\r\nROMANCE AND POETRY\r\n\r\nIn prose and verse there are two Moslem productions which have attained\r\nwide popularity in European lands. The first work is the _Thousand and One\r\nNights_, a collection of tales written in Arabic and describing life and\r\nmanners at the court of the Abbasids. The book, as we now have it, seems\r\nto have been composed as late as the fifteenth century, but it borrows\r\nmuch from earlier Arabic sources. Many of the tales are of Indian or\r\nPersian origin, but all have a thoroughly Moslem coloring. The second work\r\nis the _Rubáiyát_ of the astronomer-poet of Persia, Omar Khayyam, who\r\nwrote about the beginning of the twelfth century. His _Rubáiyát_ is a\r\nlittle volume of quatrains, about five hundred in all, distinguished for\r\nwit, satirical power, and a vein of melancholy, sometimes pensive,\r\nsometimes passionate. These characteristics of Omar's poetry have made it\r\nwidely known in the western world. [29]\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE\r\n\r\nPainting and sculpture owe little to the Arabs, but their architecture,\r\nbased in part on Byzantine and Persian models, reached a high level of\r\nexcellence. Swelling domes, vaulted roofs, arched porches, tall and\r\ngraceful minarets, and the exquisite decorative patterns known as\r\n\"arabesques\" make many Arab buildings miracles of beauty. Glazed tiles,\r\nmosaics, and jeweled glass were extensively used for ornamentation. From\r\nthe first the Arab builders adopted the pointed arch; they introduced it\r\ninto western Europe; and it became a characteristic feature of Gothic\r\ncathedrals. [30] Among the best-known of Arab buildings are the so-called\r\n\"Mosque of Omar\" at Jerusalem, [31] the Great Mosque of Cordova, and that\r\narchitectural gem, the Alhambra at Granada. Many features of Moorish art\r\nwere taken over by the Spaniards, who reproduced them in the cathedrals\r\nand missions of Mexico and California.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPITALS AND ARABESQUES FROM THE ALHAMBRA\r\nOne of Mohammed's laws forbidding the use of idols was subsequently\r\nexpanded by religious teachers into a prohibition of all imitations of\r\nhuman or animal forms in art. Sculptors who observed this prohibition\r\nrelied for ornamentation on intricate geometrical designs known as\r\narabesques. These were carved in stone or molded in plaster.]\r\n\r\n\r\n137. THE INFLUENCE OF ISLAM\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF ISLAM\r\n\r\nThe division of the Arabian Empire into rival caliphates did not check the\r\nspread of Islam. The Turks and Mongols during the Middle Ages carried it\r\nto the uttermost regions of Asia and throughout southeastern Europe. Some\r\nparts of the territory thus gained by it have since been lost. Spain and\r\nthe Balkan peninsula are once more Christian lands. In other parts of the\r\nworld, and notably in Africa and India, the religion of Mohammed is\r\nspreading faster than any other creed. Islam to-day claims about two\r\nhundred million adherents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FOUNTAIN OF THE LIONS IN THE ALHAMBRA\r\nThe most remarkable feature of the Alhambra is the Court of the Lions. It\r\nmeasures 116 feet in length by 66 feet in breadth. A gallery supported on\r\nmarble columns surrounds the court. In the center is the Fountain of\r\nLions, an alabaster basin resting on the backs of 12 marble lions.]\r\n\r\nTHE BENEFITS OF ISLAM\r\n\r\nThe growth of Islam is evidence that it meets the needs of Asiatic and\r\nAfrican peoples. Its simple creed--the unity of God, man's immortal soul,\r\nand material rewards and penalties in a future life--adapt it to the\r\nunderstanding of half-civilized peoples. As a religion it is immeasurably\r\nsuperior to the rude nature worship and idolatry which it has supplanted.\r\nThe same is true of Islam as a system of morality. The practice of the\r\nvirtues recommended by the Koran and the avoidance of the vices which that\r\nbook condemns tend to raise its adherents in the moral scale.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF WOMEN\r\n\r\nFrom the moral standpoint one of the least satisfactory features of Islam\r\nis its attitude toward women. The ancient Arabs, like many other peoples,\r\nseem to have set no limit to the number of wives a man might possess.\r\nWomen were regarded by them as mere chattels, and female infants were\r\nfrequently put to death. Mohammed recognized polygamy, but limited the\r\nnumber of legitimate wives to four. At the same time Mohammed sought to\r\nimprove the condition of women by forbidding female infanticide, by\r\nrestricting the facilities for divorce, and by insisting on kind treatment\r\nof wives by their husbands. \"The best of you,\" he said, \"is he who behaves\r\nbest to his wives.\" According to eastern custom Moslem women are secluded\r\nin a separate part of the house, called the _harem_. [32] They never\r\nappear in public, except when closely veiled from the eyes of strangers.\r\nTheir education is also much neglected.\r\n\r\nSLAVERY\r\n\r\nSlavery, like polygamy, was a custom which Mohammed found fully\r\nestablished among the Arabs. He disliked slavery and tried in several ways\r\nto lessen its evils. He declared that the emancipation of Moslem slaves\r\nwas an act of special merit, and ordered that in a war between Moslems the\r\nprisoners were not to be enslaved. Mohammed also insisted on kind\r\ntreatment of slaves by their masters. \"Feed your slaves,\" he directed,\r\n\"with food of that which you eat and clothe them with such clothing as you\r\nwear, and command them not to do that which they are unable to do.\" The\r\ncondition of Moslem slaves does not appear to be intolerable, though the\r\nslave traffic which still exists in some parts of Africa is a disgrace to\r\nIslam.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

SCANDINAVIA AND THE NORTHMEN\r\n\r\nA NEW SERIES OF MIGRATIONS\r\n\r\nFrom the East we return once more to the West, from Asia to Europe, from\r\nArabia to Scandinavia. We have now to deal with the raids and settlements\r\nof the Norsemen or Northmen. Like the Arabs the Northmen quitted a sterile\r\npeninsula and went forth to find better homes in distant lands. Their\r\ninvasions, beginning toward the close of the eighth century, lasted about\r\nthree hundred years.\r\n\r\nA TEUTONIC MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nThe Northmen belonged to the Teutonic family of peoples. They were kinsmen\r\nof the Germans, the Anglo-Saxons, and the Dutch. Their migrations may be\r\nregarded, therefore, as the last wave of that great Teutonic movement\r\nwhich in earlier times had inundated western Europe and overwhelmed the\r\nRoman Empire.\r\n\r\nSCANDINAVIA\r\n\r\nThe Northmen lived, as their descendants still live, in Denmark, Sweden,\r\nand Norway. The name Scandinavia is sometimes applied to all three\r\ncountries, but more commonly it is restricted to the peninsula comprising\r\nSweden and Norway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWEDISH ROCK CARVING\r\nShows a man plowing.]\r\n\r\nSWEDEN\r\n\r\nSweden, with the exception of the northern highlands, is mostly a level\r\nregion, watered by copious streams, dotted with many lakes, and sinking\r\ndown gradually to the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia. The fact that\r\nSweden faces these inland waters determined the course of her development\r\nas a nation. She never has had any aspirations to become a great oceanic\r\npower. Her whole historic life has centered about the Baltic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RUNIC STONE\r\nA stone, twelve feet high and six feet wide, in the churchyard of Rok,\r\nOstergotland, Sweden. The runic inscription, which contains more than 760\r\nletters, is the longest known.]\r\n\r\nNORWAY\r\n\r\nNorway, in contrast to Sweden, faces the Atlantic. The country is little\r\nmore than a strip of rugged seacoast reaching northward to well within the\r\nArctic Circle. Were it not for the influence of the \"Gulf Stream drift,\"\r\nmuch of Norway would be a frozen waste for the greater part of the year.\r\nVast forests of fir, pine, and birch still cover the greater part of the\r\ncountry, and the land which can be used for farming and grazing does not\r\nexceed eleven per cent of the entire area. But Norway, like Greece, [2]\r\nhas an extent of shore-line out of all proportion to its superficial area.\r\nSo numerous are the fiords, or inlets of the sea, that the total length of\r\nthe coast approximates twelve thousand miles. Slight wonder that the\r\nVikings, [3] as they called themselves, should feel the lure of the ocean\r\nand should put forth their frail barks upon the \"pathway of the swans\" in\r\nsearch of booty and adventure.\r\n\r\nPREHISTORIC TIMES IN SCANDINAVIA\r\n\r\nThe Swedes and Norwegians, together with their kinsmen, the Danes,\r\nprobably settled in Scandinavia long before the beginning of the Christian\r\nera. During the earlier part of the prehistoric period the inhabitants\r\nwere still in the Stone Age, but the use of bronze, and then of iron, was\r\ngradually introduced. Excavations in ancient grave mounds have revealed\r\nimplements of the finest polished stone, beautiful bronze swords, and\r\ncoats of iron ring mail, besides gold and silver ornaments which may have\r\nbeen imported from southern Europe. The ancient Scandinavians have left to\r\nus curious records of the past in their picture writing chiseled on the\r\nflat surface of rocks. The objects represented include boats with as many\r\nas thirty men in them, horses drawing two-wheeled carts, spans of oxen,\r\nfarmers engaged in ploughing, and warriors on horseback. By the close of\r\nthe prehistoric period the northern peoples were also familiar with a form\r\nof the Greek alphabet (the \"runes\" [4]) and with the art of writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n139. THE VIKING AGE\r\n\r\nDAWN OF HISTORY IN SCANDINAVIA\r\n\r\nThe Viking Age, with which historic times begin in northern Europe,\r\nextends from about 800 A.D. to the introduction of Christianity in the\r\ntenth and eleventh centuries. This was the period when the Northmen, or\r\nVikings, realizing that the sea offered the quickest road to wealth and\r\nconquest, began to make long voyages to foreign lands. In part they went\r\nas traders and exchanged the furs, wool, and fish of Scandinavia for the\r\nclothing, ornaments, and other articles of luxury found in neighboring\r\ncountries. But it was no far cry from merchant to freebooter, and, in\r\nfact, expeditions for the sake of plunder seem to have been even more\r\npopular with the Northmen than peaceful commerce.\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHMEN AS SAILORS\r\n\r\nWhether the Northmen engaged in trade or in warfare, good ships and good\r\nseamanship were indispensable to them. They became the boldest sailors of\r\nthe early Middle Ages. No longer hugging the coast, as timid mariners had\r\nalways done before them, the Northmen pushed out into the uncharted main\r\nand steered their course only by observation of the sun and stars. In this\r\nway the Northmen were led to make those remarkable explorations in the\r\nAtlantic Ocean and the polar seas which added so greatly to geographical\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nSHIPS OF THE NORTHMEN\r\n\r\nIt was not uncommon for a Viking chieftain, after his days of sea-roving\r\nhad ended, to be buried in his ship, over which a grave chamber, covered\r\nwith earth, would be erected. The discovery of several of these burial\r\nships enables us to form a good idea of Viking vessels. The largest of\r\nthem might reach a length of seventy feet and hold as many as one hundred\r\nand twenty men. A fleet of the Northmen, carrying several thousand\r\nwarriors, mail-clad and armed with spears, swords, and battle-axes, was\r\nindeed formidable. During this period the Northmen were the masters of the\r\nsea, as far as western Europe was concerned. This fact largely explains\r\ntheir successful campaigns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VIKING SHIP\r\nThe Gokstad vessel is of oak, twenty-eight feet long and sixteen feet\r\nbroad in the center. It has seats for sixteen pairs of rowers, a mast for\r\na single sail, and a rudder on the right or starboard side. The gunwale\r\nwas decorated with a series of shields, painted alternately black and\r\ngold. This ship, which probably dates from about 900 A.D., was found on\r\nthe shore of Christiania Fiord. A still larger ship, of about the same\r\ndate, was taken in 1904 A.D. from the grave of a Norwegian queen at\r\nOseberg. With the queen had been buried a four-wheeled wagon, three\r\nsleighs, three beds, two chests, a chair, a large loom, and various\r\nkitchen utensils, in fact everything needed for her comfort in the other\r\nworld.]\r\n\r\nTHE SAGAS\r\n\r\nA very important source of information for the Viking Age consists of the\r\nwritings called sagas. [5] These narratives are in prose, but they were\r\nbased, in many instances, on the songs which the minstrels (_skalds_) sang\r\nto appreciative audiences assembled at the banqueting board of a Viking\r\nchieftain. It was not until the twelfth and thirteenth centuries that the\r\nsagas were committed to writing. This was done chiefly in Iceland, and so\r\nit happens that we must look to that distant island for the beginnings of\r\nScandinavian literature.\r\n\r\nSUBJECT MATTER OF THE SAGAS\r\n\r\nThe sagas belong to different classes. The oldest of them relate the deeds\r\nof Viking heroes and their families. Others deal with the lives of\r\nNorwegian kings. Some of the most important sagas describe the\r\nexplorations and settlements of the Northmen and hence possess\r\nconsiderable value as historical records.\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHMEN AS SEEN IN THE SAGAS\r\n\r\nThe sagas throw much light on the character of the Northmen. Love of\r\nadventure and contempt for the quiet joys of home comes out in the\r\ndescription of Viking chiefs, who \"never sought refuge under a roof nor\r\nemptied their drinking-horns by a hearth.\" An immense love of fighting\r\nbreathes in the accounts of Viking warriors, \"who are glad when they have\r\nhopes of a battle; they will leap up in hot haste and ply the oars,\r\nsnapping the oar-thongs and cracking the tholes.\" The undaunted spirit of\r\nViking sailors, braving the storms of the northern ocean, expresses itself\r\nin their sea songs: \"The force of the tempest assists the arms of our\r\noarsmen; the hurricane is our servant, it drives us whithersoever we wish\r\nto go.\" The sagas also reveal other characteristics of the Northmen: a\r\ncruelty and faithlessness which made them a terror to their foes; an\r\nalmost barbaric love of gay clothing and ornament; a strong sense of\r\npublic order, giving rise to an elaborate legal system; and even a feeling\r\nfor the romantic beauty of their northern home, with its snow-clad\r\nmountains, dark forests of pine, sparkling waterfalls, and deep, blue\r\nfiords.\r\n\r\nEDDAIC POEMS\r\n\r\nIt is to the Viking Age also that we owe the composition of the poems\r\ngoing by the name of the _Elder Edda_. These poems, as well as the prose\r\nsagas, were collected and arranged in Iceland during the later Middle\r\nAges. The _Elder Edda_ is a storehouse of old Norse mythology. It forms\r\nour chief source of knowledge concerning Scandinavian heathenism before\r\nthe introduction of Christianity.\r\n\r\n\r\n140. SCANDINAVIAN HEATHENISM\r\n\r\nTHE GOD ODIN\r\n\r\nThe religion of the Northmen bore a close resemblance to that of the other\r\nTeutonic peoples. The leading deity was Odin (German _Woden_), whose\r\nexploits are celebrated in many of the songs of the _Elder Edda_. Odin was\r\nrepresented as a tall, gray-bearded chieftain, carrying a shield and a\r\nspear which never missed its mark. Though a god of battle, Odin was also a\r\nlover of wisdom. He discovered the runes which gave him secret knowledge\r\nof all things. Legend told how Odin killed a mighty giant, whose body was\r\ncut into pieces to form the world: the earth was his flesh, the water his\r\nblood, the rocks his bones, and the heavens his skull. Having created the\r\nworld and peopled it with human beings, Odin retired to the sacred city of\r\nAsgard, where he reigned in company with his children.\r\n\r\nTHE GOD THOR\r\n\r\nEnthroned beside Odin sat his oldest son, Thor (German _Thunor_), god of\r\nthunder and lightning. His weapon, the thunderbolt, was imagined as a\r\nhammer, and was especially used by him to protect gods and men against the\r\ngiants. The hammer, when thrown, returned to his hand of its own accord.\r\nThor also possessed a belt of strength, which, when girded about him,\r\ndoubled his power.\r\n\r\nTHOR'S DEEDS OF STRENGTH\r\n\r\nMany stories were told of Thor's adventures, when visiting Jötunheim, the\r\nabode of the giants. In a drinking-match he tried to drain a horn of\r\nliquor, not knowing that one end of the horn reached the sea, which was\r\nappreciably lowered by the god's huge draughts. He sought to lift from the\r\nground a large, gray cat, but struggle as he might, could raise only one\r\nof the animal's feet. What Thor took for a cat, however, was really the\r\nMidgard serpent, which, with its tail in its mouth, encircled the earth.\r\nIn the last trial of strength Thor wrestled with an old woman, and after a\r\nviolent contest was thrown down upon one knee. But the hag was in truth\r\nrelentless old age, who sooner or later lays low all men.\r\n\r\nMYTH OF BALDER\r\n\r\nMost beautiful and best beloved of the Scandinavian divinities was Odin's\r\nson, Balder. He was represented as a gentle deity of innocence and\r\nrighteousness. As long as he lived, evil could gain no real control in the\r\nworld and the power of the gods would remain unshaken. To preserve Balder\r\nfrom all danger his mother Frigga required everything on earth to swear\r\nnever to harm her son. Only a single plant, the mistletoe, did not take\r\nthe oath. Then the traitor Loki gathered the mistletoe and came to an\r\nassembly where the gods were hurling all kinds of missiles at Balder, to\r\nshow that nothing could hurt him. Loki asked the blind Höder to throw the\r\nplant at Balder. Höder did so, and Balder fell dead. The gods tried to\r\nrecover him from Hel, the gloomy underworld, but Hel demanded as his\r\nransom a tear from every living creature. Gods, men, and even things\r\ninanimate wept for Balder, except one cruel giantess--Loki in disguise--\r\nwho would not give a single tear. She said, \"Neither living nor dead was\r\nBalder of any use to me. Let Hel keep what it has.\"\r\n\r\n\"TWILIGHT OF THE GODS\"\r\n\r\nDisasters followed Balder's death. An immense fire burned up the world and\r\nthe human race. The giants invaded Asgard and slaughtered its inhabitants.\r\nOdin fell a victim to the mighty wolf Fenris. Thor, having killed the\r\nMidgard serpent, was suffocated with the venom which the dying monster\r\ncast over him. The end of all things arrived. This was the catastrophe\r\nwhich had been predicted of old--the \"Twilight of the Gods.\"\r\n\r\nVALHALLA\r\n\r\nBesides the conception of Hel, the Northmen also framed the idea of\r\nValhalla, [6] the abode to which Odin received the souls of those who had\r\ndied, not ingloriously in their beds, but on the field of battle. A troop\r\nof divine maidens, the Valkyries, [7] rode through the air on Odin's\r\nservice to determine the issue of battles and to select brave warriors for\r\nValhalla. There on the broad plains they fought with one another by day,\r\nbut at evening the slayer and the slain returned to Odin's hall to feast\r\nmightily on boar's flesh and drink deep draughts of mead.\r\n\r\nSUPERNATURAL BEINGS\r\n\r\nAs with most heathen religions that of the Northmen was full of terrors.\r\nTheir lively imagination peopled the world with many strange figures.\r\nFiends and monsters inhabited the marshes, giants lived in the dark\r\nforest, evil spirits haunted all solitary places, and ghosts stalked over\r\nthe land by night. The use of charms and spells to guard against such\r\ncreatures passed over into Christian times. Their memory also survives in\r\nfolk tales, which are full of allusions to giants, dwarfs, goblins, and\r\nother supernatural beings.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIANIZATION OF THE NORTHMEN\r\n\r\nChristianity first gained a foothold in Denmark through the work of Roman\r\nCatholic missionaries sent out by Charlemagne's son, Louis the Pious. [8]\r\nTwo centuries elapsed before the Danes were completely converted. From\r\nDenmark the new faith spread to Sweden. Norway owed its conversion largely\r\nto the crusading work of King Olaf (1016-1029 A.D.), whose zeal for\r\nChristianity won him the title of Olaf the Saint. The Norwegians carried\r\nChristianity to Iceland, where it supplanted the old heathenism in the\r\nyear 1000 A.D. With the general adoption of the Christian religion in\r\nScandinavian lands, the Viking Age drew to an end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORSE METAL WORK (Museum, Copenhagen)\r\nA door from a church in Iceland; date, tenth or eleventh century. The iron\r\nknob is inlaid with silver. The slaying of a dragon is represented above\r\nand below is shown the Midgard serpent.]\r\n\r\n\r\n141. THE NORTHMEN IN THE WEST\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF THE VIKING MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nThe Northmen were still heathen when they set forth on their expeditions\r\nof plunder and conquest. Doubtless the principal cause of this Viking\r\nmovement is to be sought in the same hunger for land which prompted the\r\nGermanic invasions and, in fact, has led to colonial expansion in all\r\nages. By the ninth century Scandinavia could no longer support its rapidly\r\ngrowing population, and enforced emigration was the natural consequence.\r\nThe political condition of Scandinavia at this time also helps to explain\r\nthe Viking expansion. Denmark and Norway had now become strong kingdoms,\r\nwhose rulers forced all who would not submit to their sway to leave the\r\ncountry. Thus it resulted that the numbers of the emigrants were swelled\r\nby exiles, outlaws, and other adventurers who turned to the sea in hope of\r\ngain.\r\n\r\nRAIDS OF THE NORTHMEN\r\n\r\nThe Northmen started out as pirates and fell on the coasts of England,\r\nFrance, and Germany. In their shallow boats they also found it easy to\r\nascend the rivers and reach places lying far inland. The Northmen directed\r\ntheir attacks especially against the churches and monasteries, which were\r\nfull of treasure and less easily defended than fortified towns. Their\r\nraids inspired such great terror that a special prayer was inserted in the\r\nchurch services: \"From the fury of the Northmen, good Lord, deliver us.\"\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHMEN IN IRELAND, SCOTLAND, AND THE ISLANDS\r\n\r\nAt first the incursions of the Northmen took place only in summer, but\r\nbefore long they began to winter in the lands which they visited. Year by\r\nyear their fleets became larger, and their attacks changed from mere\r\nforays of pirates to well-organized expeditions of conquest and\r\ncolonization. Early in the ninth century we find them making permanent\r\nsettlements in Ireland, and for a time bringing a considerable part of\r\nthat country under their control. The first cities on Irish soil,\r\nincluding Dublin and Limerick, were founded by the Northmen. Almost\r\nsimultaneously with the attacks on Ireland came those on the western coast\r\nof Scotland. In the course of their westward expeditions the Northmen had\r\nalready discovered the Faroe Islands, the Orkneys, the Shetlands and the\r\nHebrides. These barren and inhospitable islands received large numbers of\r\nNorse immigrants and long remained under Scandinavian control.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, DISCOVERIES OF THE NORTHMEN IN THE WEST]\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHMEN IN ICELAND\r\n\r\nThe Northmen soon discovered Iceland, where Irish monks had previously\r\nsettled. Colonization began in 874 A.D. [9] One of the most valuable of\r\nthe sagas--the \"Book of the Land-taking\"--describes the emigration to the\r\nisland and enumerates the Viking chiefs who took part in the movement.\r\nIceland soon became almost a second Norway in language, literature, and\r\ncustoms. It remains to-day an outpost of Scandinavian civilization.\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHMEN IN GREENLAND\r\n\r\nThe first settlement of Greenland was the work of an Icelander, Eric the\r\nRed, who reached the island toward the end of the tenth century. He called\r\nthe country Greenland, not because it was green, but because, as he said,\r\n\"there is nothing like a good name to attract settlers.\" Intercourse\r\nbetween Greenland and Iceland was often dangerous, and at times was\r\nentirely interrupted by ice. Leif Ericsson, the son of Eric the Red,\r\nestablished a new route of commerce and travel by sailing from Greenland\r\nto Norway by way of the Hebrides. This was the first voyage made directly\r\nacross the Atlantic. Norway and Greenland continued to enjoy a flourishing\r\ntrade for several centuries. After the connection with Norway had been\r\nsevered, the Greenlanders joined the Eskimos and mingled with that\r\nprimitive people.\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHMEN IN AMERICA\r\n\r\nTwo of the sagas give accounts of a voyage which Leif Ericsson about 1000\r\nA.D. made to regions lying southward from Greenland. In the sagas they are\r\ncalled Helluland (stone-land), Markland (wood-land), and Vinland. Just\r\nwhat part of the coast of North America these countries occupied is an\r\nunsolved problem. Leif Ericsson and the Greenlanders who followed him seem\r\nto have reached at least the shores of Labrador, Newfoundland, and Nova\r\nScotia. They may have gone even farther southward, for the sagas describe\r\nregions where the climate was mild enough for wild vines and wild wheat to\r\ngrow. The Northmen, however, did not follow up their explorations by\r\nlasting settlements. Before long all memory of the far western lands faded\r\nfrom the minds of men. The curtain fell on the New World, not again to\r\nrise until the time of Columbus and Cabot.\r\n\r\n\r\n142. THE NORTHMEN IN THE EAST\r\n\r\nARCTIC EXPLORATIONS OF THE NORTHMEN\r\n\r\nIn the Viking movement westward across the Atlantic the Norwegians took\r\nthe leading part. They also sailed far northward, rounding the North Cape\r\nand reaching the mouth of the Dwina River in the White Sea. Viking\r\nsailors, therefore, have the credit for undertaking the first voyages of\r\nexploration into the Arctic.\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHMEN IN FINLAND\r\n\r\nThe Swedes, on account of their geographical position, were naturally the\r\nmost active in expeditions to eastern lands. At a very early date they\r\ncrossed the Gulf of Bothnia and paid frequent visits to Finland. Its rude\r\ninhabitants, the Finns, were related in language, and doubtless in blood\r\nalso, to the Huns, Magyars, and other Asiatic peoples. Sweden ruled\r\nFinland throughout the Middle Ages. Russia obtained control of the country\r\nduring the eighteenth century, but Swedish influence has made it largely\r\nScandinavian in civilization.\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHMEN IN RUSSIA\r\n\r\nThe activities of the Swedes also led them to establish settlements on the\r\nsouthern shore of the Baltic and far inland along the waterways leading\r\ninto Russia. An old Russian chronicler declares that in 862 A.D. the Slavs\r\nsent an embassy to the Swedes, whom they called \"Rus,\" saying, \"Our\r\ncountry is large and rich, but there is no order in it; come and rule over\r\nus.\" The Swedes were not slow to accept the invitation. Their leader,\r\nRuric, established a dynasty which reigned in Russia for more than seven\r\nhundred years. [10]\r\n\r\nNOVGOROD AND KIEV\r\n\r\nThe first Russian state centered in the city of Novgorod, near Lake Ilmen,\r\nwhere Ruric built a strong fortress. [11] Novgorod during the Middle Ages\r\nwas an important station on the trade route between Constantinople and the\r\nBaltic. Some of Ruric's followers, passing southward along the Dnieper\r\nRiver, took possession of the small town of Kiev. It subsequently became\r\nthe capital of the Scandinavian possessions in Russia.\r\n\r\nSCANDINAVIAN INFLUENCE IN RUSSIA\r\n\r\nThe Northmen in Russia maintained close intercourse with their mother\r\ncountry for about two centuries. During this period they did much to open\r\nup northeastern Europe to the forces of civilization and progress.\r\nColonies were founded, cities were built, commerce was fostered, and a\r\nstable government was established. Russia under the sway of the Northmen\r\nbecame for the first time a truly European state.\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHMEN AND THE ROMAN EMPIRE IN THE EAST\r\n\r\nHaving penetrated the wilds of Russia, it was comparatively easy for the\r\nNorthmen to sail down the Russian rivers to the Black Sea and thence to\r\nConstantinople. Some of them went as raiders and several times devastated\r\nthe neighborhood of Constantinople, until bought off by the payment of\r\ntribute. [12] Many Northmen also joined the bodyguard of the eastern\r\nemperor and saw service under his standard in different parts of the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIANITY IN RUSSIA, 988 A.D.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Vladimir, a descendant of Ruric, the Christian\r\nreligion gained its first foothold in Russia. We are told that Vladimir,\r\nhaving made up his mind to embrace a new faith, sent commissioners to Rome\r\nand Constantinople, and also to the adherents of Islam and Judaism. His\r\nenvoys reported in favor of the Greek Church, for their barbarian\r\nimagination had been so impressed by the majesty of the ceremonies\r\nperformed in Sancta Sophia that \"they did not know whether they were on\r\nearth or in heaven.\" Vladimir accepted their report, ordered the idols of\r\nKiev to be thrown into the Dnieper, and had himself and his people\r\nbaptized according to the rites of the Greek Church. At the same time he\r\nmarried a sister of the reigning emperor at Constantinople.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF THE CONVERSION OF RUSSIA\r\n\r\nVladimir's decision to adopt the Greek form of Christianity is justly\r\nregarded as one of the formative influences in Russian history. It meant\r\nthat the Slavs were to come under the religious influence of\r\nConstantinople, instead of under that of Rome. Furthermore, it meant that\r\nByzantine civilization, then incomparably superior to the rude culture of\r\nthe western peoples, would henceforth gain an entrance into Russia. The\r\ncountry profited by this rich civilization and during the early part of\r\nthe Middle Ages took a foremost place in Europe.\r\n\r\nCHARLEMAGNE AND THE NORTHMEN\r\n\r\nNo part of western Europe suffered more severely from the Northmen than\r\nFrance. They first appeared on the French coast toward the end of\r\nCharlemagne's reign. A well-known legend relates that the emperor, from\r\nwindow of his palace once saw the dark sails of the Vikings and wept at\r\nthe thought of the misery which these daring pirates would some day\r\ninflict upon his realm.\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHMEN IN FRANCE\r\n\r\nAfter Charlemagne's death the wars of his grandsons left the empire\r\ndefenseless, and the Northmen in consequence redoubled their attacks. They\r\nsailed far up the Seine, the Loire, and the Garonne to plunder and murder.\r\nParis, then a small but important city, lay in the path of the invaders\r\nand more than once suffered at their hands. The destruction by the\r\nNorthmen of many monasteries was a loss to civilization, for the monastic\r\nestablishments at this time were the chief centers of learning and\r\nculture. [13]\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHMEN IN GERMANY\r\n\r\nThe heavy hand of the Northmen also descended on Germany. The rivers\r\nScheldt, Meuse, Rhine, and Elbe enabled them to proceed at will into the\r\nheart of the country. Liège, Cologne, Strassburg, Hamburg, and other great\r\nFrankish cities fell before them. Viking raiders even plundered Aachen and\r\nstabled their horses in the church which Charlemagne had built there. [14]\r\nThus the ancient homeland of the Franks was laid completely waste.\r\n\r\nROLLO AND THE GRANT OF NORMANDY, 911 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Northmen in France began in 911 A.D., when the\r\nCarolingian king granted to a Viking chieftain, Rollo, dominion over the\r\nregion about the lower Seine. Rollo on his part agreed to accept\r\nChristianity and to acknowledge the French ruler as his lord. It is said,\r\nhowever, that he would not kneel and kiss the king's foot as a mark of\r\nhomage, and that the follower who performed the unwelcome duty did it so\r\nawkwardly as to overturn the king, to the great amusement of the assembled\r\nNorthmen. The story illustrates the Viking sense of independence.\r\n\r\nDUCHY OF NORMANDY\r\n\r\nThe district ceded to Rollo developed into what in later times was known\r\nas the duchy of Normandy. Its Scandinavian settlers, henceforth called\r\nNormans, [15] soon became French in language and culture. It was amazing\r\nto see how quickly the descendants of wild sea-rovers put off their\r\nheathen ways and made their new home a Christian land, noted for its\r\nchurches, monasteries, and schools. Normandy remained practically\r\nindependent till the beginning of the thirteenth century, when a French\r\nking added it to his possessions. [16]\r\n\r\nTHE NORMANS AND HUGH CAPET, 987 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Normans helped to found the medieval French monarchy. During the tenth\r\ncentury the old Carolingian line of rulers, which had already died out in\r\nGermany and Italy, [17] came also to an end in France. A new dynasty was\r\nthen founded by a nobleman named Hugh Capet, who secured the aid of the\r\npowerful Norman dukes in his efforts to gain the throne. The accession of\r\nHugh Capet took place in 987 A.D. His descendants reigned over France for\r\nalmost exactly eight hundred years. [18]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n144. CONQUEST OF ENGLAND BY THE DANES; ALFRED THE GREAT\r\n\r\nENGLAND OVERRUN BY THE DANES\r\n\r\nEven before Egbert of Wessex succeeded in uniting all the Anglo-Saxon\r\nkingdoms, [19] bands of Vikings, chiefly from Denmark, had made occasional\r\nforays on the English coast. Egbert kept the Danes at bay, but he died in\r\n839 A.D., and from that time the real invasion of England began. The Danes\r\ncame over in large numbers, made permanent settlements, and soon\r\ncontrolled all England north of the Thames.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALFRED THE GREAT\r\nA lofty bronze statue by H. Thorneycraft set up at Winchester Alfred's\r\nancient capital. It was dedicated in 1901 A.D. on the thousandth\r\nanniversary of his death. The inscription reads:\r\n\r\n  \"Alfred found learning dead,\r\n    And he restored it,\r\n  Education neglected\r\n    And he revived it,\r\n  The laws powerless\r\n    And he gave them force,\r\n  The Church debased,\r\n    And he raised it,\r\n  The land ravaged by a fearful enemy\r\n    From which he delivered it.\"]\r\n\r\nKING ALFRED AND THE DANES\r\n\r\nWessex before long experienced the full force of the Danish attack. The\r\ncountry at this time was ruled by Alfred, the grandson of Egbert. Alfred\r\ncame to the throne in 871 A.D., when he was only about twenty-three years\r\nold. In spite of his youth, he showed himself the right sort of leader for\r\nthe hard-pressed West Saxons. For several years fortune favored the Danes.\r\nThen the tide turned. Issuing from the marshes of Somersetshire, where he\r\nhad rallied his dispirited troops, Alfred suddenly fell on the enemy and\r\ngained a signal success. The beaten Danes agreed to make peace and to\r\naccept the religion of their conquerors.\r\n\r\nTHE DANELAW\r\n\r\nAlfred's victory did not end the war. Indeed, almost to the end of his\r\nreign, the heroic king had to face the Vikings, but he always drove them\r\noff and even recovered some of the territory north of the Thames. The\r\nEnglish and Danes finally agreed to a treaty dividing the country between\r\nthem. The eastern part of England, where the invaders were firmly\r\nestablished, came to be called the Danelaw, because here the Danish, and\r\nnot the Anglo-Saxon, law prevailed. In the Danelaw the Danes have left\r\nmemorials of themselves in local names [20] and in the bold, adventurous\r\ncharacter of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, ENGLAND UNDER ALFRED THE GREAT]\r\n\r\nCIVILIZING ACTIVITIES OF ALFRED\r\n\r\nIt was a well-nigh ruined country which Alfred had now to rule over and\r\nbuild up again. His work of restoration invites comparison with that of\r\nCharlemagne. Alfred's first care was to organize a fighting force always\r\nready at his call to repel invasion. He also created an efficient fleet,\r\nwhich patrolled the coast and engaged the Vikings on their own element. He\r\nhad the laws of the Anglo-Saxons collected and reduced to writing, taking\r\npains at the same time to see that justice was done between man and man.\r\nHe did much to rebuild the ruined churches and monasteries. Alfred labored\r\nwith especial diligence to revive education among the English folk. His\r\ncourt at Winchester became a literary center where learned men wrote and\r\ntaught. The king himself mastered Latin, in order that he might translate\r\nLatin books into the English tongue. So great were Alfred's services in\r\nthis direction that he has been called \"the father of English prose.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALFRED'S JEWEL (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford)\r\nA jewel of blue enamel inclosed in a setting of gold, with the words\r\naround it \"Alfred had me wrought.\" Found at Athelney in the seventeenth\r\ncentury.]\r\n\r\nALFRED'S CHARACTER\r\n\r\nAlfred alone of English rulers bears the title of \"the Great.\" He well\r\ndeserves it, not only for what he did but for what he was. Through the\r\nmists of ten centuries his figure still looms large. It is the figure of a\r\nbrave, patient, and modest man, who wore himself out in the service of his\r\npeople. The oft-quoted words which he added to one of his translations\r\nform a fitting epitaph to this noble king: \"My wish was to live worthily\r\nas long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come\r\nafter, my memory in good works.\" His wish has been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nFROM ALFRED TO THE NORMAN CONQUEST, 901-1066 A.D.\r\n\r\nAbout seventy-five years after Alfred's death the Danes renewed their\r\ninvasions. It then became necessary to buy them off with an annual tribute\r\ncalled the Danegeld. Early in the eleventh century Canute, the son of a\r\nDanish king, succeeded in establishing himself on the English throne\r\n(1016-1035 A.D.). His dynasty did not last long, however, and at length\r\nthe old West-Saxon line was restored in the person of Edward the Confessor\r\n(or \"the Saint\"). Edward had spent most of his early life in Normandy, and\r\non coming to England brought with him a large following of Normans, whom\r\nhe placed in high positions. During his reign (1042-1066 A.D.) Norman\r\nnobles and churchmen gained a foothold in England, thus preparing the way\r\nfor the Norman conquest of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n145. NORMAN CONQUEST OF ENGLAND; WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR\r\n\r\nHAROLD AND WILLIAM\r\n\r\nEdward the Confessor having left no direct heirs, the choice of his\r\nsuccessor fell lawfully upon the Witenagemot, [21] as the national\r\nassembly of noblemen and higher clergy was called. This body chose as\r\nking, Harold, earl of Wessex, the leading man in England. Harold's right\r\nto the succession was disputed by William, duke of Normandy, who declared\r\nthat the crown had been promised to him by his cousin, the Confessor.\r\nWilliam also asserted that Harold had once sworn a solemn oath, over a\r\nchest of sacred relics, to support his claim to the throne on Edward's\r\ndeath. When word came of Harold's election, William wrathfully denounced\r\nhim as a usurper and began to prepare a fleet and an army for the invasion\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM'S PREPARATIONS\r\n\r\nNormandy under Duke William had become a powerful, well-organized state.\r\nNorman knights, attracted by promises of wide lands and rich booty, if\r\nthey should conquer, formed the core of William's forces. Adventurers from\r\nevery part of France, and even from Spain and Italy, also entered his\r\nservice. The pope blessed the enterprise and sent to William a ring\r\ncontaining a hair from St. Peter's head and a consecrated banner. When all\r\nwas ready in the late fall of 1066 A.D., a large fleet, bearing five or\r\nsix thousand archers, foot soldiers, and horsemen, crossed the Channel and\r\nlanded in England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SCENE FROM THE BAYEUX TAPESTRY (Museum of Bayeux,\r\nNormandy)\r\n\r\nThe Bayeux Tapestry, which almost certainly belongs to the time of the\r\nNorman Conquest, is a strip of coarse linen cloth, about 230 feet long by\r\n20 inches wide, embroidered in worsted thread of eight different colors.\r\nThere are seventy-two scenes picturing various events in the history of\r\nthe Norman Conquest. The illustration given above represents an attack of\r\nNorman cavalry on the English shield wall at the battle of Hastings.]\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF HASTINGS, 1066 A.D.\r\n\r\nWilliam at first met no resistance. Harold was far away in the north\r\nfighting against the Norwegians, who had seized the opportunity to make\r\nanother descent on the English coast. Harold defeated them decisively and\r\nthen hurried southward to face his new foe. The two armies met near\r\nHastings on the road to London. All day they fought. The stout English\r\ninfantry, behind their wall of shields, threw back one charge after\r\nanother of the Norman knights. Again and again the duke rallied his men\r\nand led them where the foe was thickest. A cry arose that he was slain. \"I\r\nlive,\" shouted William, tearing off his helmet that all might see his\r\nface, \"and by God's help will conquer yet.\" At last, with the approach of\r\nevening, Harold was killed by an arrow; his household guard died about\r\nhim; and the rest of the English took to flight. William pitched his camp\r\non the field of victory, and \"sat down to eat and drink among the dead.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, DOMINIONS OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR]\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BECOMES KING\r\n\r\nThe battle of Hastings settled the fate of England. Following up his\r\nvictory with relentless energy, William pressed on to London. That city,\r\nnow practically the capital of the country, opened its gates to him. The\r\nWitenagemot, meeting in London offered the throne to William. On Christmas\r\nDay, 1066 A.D., in Westminster Abbey the duke of Normandy was crowned king\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM'S PERSONALITY\r\n\r\nWhat manner of man was William the Conqueror? Tall of stature, endowed\r\nwith tremendous strength, and brave even to desperation, he seemed an\r\nembodiment of the old viking spirit. \"No knight under heaven,\" men said\r\ntruly, \"was William's peer.\" A savage temper and a harsh, forbidding\r\ncountenance made him a terror even to his closest followers. \"So stern and\r\nwrathful was he,\" wrote an English chronicler, \"that none durst do\r\nanything against his will.\" Though William never shrank from force or\r\nfraud, from bloodshed or oppression, to carry out his ends, he yet showed\r\nhimself throughout his reign a patron of learning, a sincere supporter of\r\nthe Church, and a statesman of remarkable insight. He has left a lasting\r\nimpress on English history.\r\n\r\n\r\n146. RESULTS OF THE NORMAN CONQUEST\r\n\r\nNORMAN ELEMENT IN THE ENGLISH PEOPLE\r\n\r\nThe coming of the Normans to England formed the third and last installment\r\nof the Teutonic invasion. Norman merchants and artisans followed Norman\r\nsoldiers and settled particularly in the southern and eastern parts of the\r\nisland. They seem to have emigrated in considerable numbers and doubtless\r\nadded an important element to the English population. The Normans thus\r\ncompleted the work of the Anglo-Saxons and Danes in making England a\r\nTeutonic country.\r\n\r\nNORMAN ELEMENT IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that the Normans in Normandy had received\r\na considerable intermixture of French blood and had learned to speak a\r\nform of the French language (Norman-French). In England Norman-French\r\nnaturally was used by the upper and ruling classes--by the court, the\r\nnobility, and the clergy. The English held fast to their own homely\r\nlanguage, but could not fail to pick up many French expressions, as they\r\nmingled with their conquerors in churches, markets, and other places of\r\npublic resort. It took about three hundred years for French words and\r\nphrases to soak thoroughly into their speech. The result was a very large\r\naddition to the vocabulary of English. [22]\r\n\r\nUNION OF ENGLAND AND NORMANDY\r\n\r\nUntil the Norman Conquest England, because of its insular position, had\r\nremained out of touch with Continental Europe. William the Conqueror and\r\nhis immediate successors were, however, not only rulers of England, but\r\nalso dukes of Normandy and subjects of the French kings. Hence, the union\r\nof England with Normandy brought it at once into the full current of\r\nEuropean affairs. The country became for a time almost a part of France\r\nand profited by the more advanced civilization which had arisen on French\r\nsoil. The nobility, the higher clergy, and the officers of government were\r\nNormans. The architects of the castles and churches, the lawyers, and the\r\nmen of letters came from Normandy. Even the commercial and industrial\r\nclasses were largely recruited from across the Channel.\r\n\r\nENGLAND AND THE PAPACY\r\n\r\nThe Norman Conquest much increased the pope's authority over England. The\r\nEnglish Church, as has been shown, [23] was the child of Rome, but during\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon period it had become more independent of the Papacy than\r\nthe churches on the Continent. William the Conqueror, whose invasion of\r\nEngland took place with the pope's approval, repaid his obligation by\r\nbringing the country into closer dependence on the Roman pontiff.\r\n\r\nFUSION OF ENGLISH AND NORMAN\r\n\r\nAlthough the Normans settled in England as conquerors, yet after all they\r\nwere near kinsmen of the English and did not long keep separate from them.\r\nIn Normandy a century and a half had been enough to turn the Northmen into\r\nFrenchmen. So in England, at the end of a like period, the Normans became\r\nEnglishmen. Some of the qualities that have helped to make the modern\r\nEnglish a great people--their love of the sea and fondness for adventure,\r\ntheir vigor, self-reliance, and unconquerable spirit--are doubtless\r\nderived in good part from the Normans.\r\n\r\n\r\n147. NORMAN CONQUEST OF SOUTHERN ITALY AND SICILY\r\n\r\nNORMAN EXPANSION SOUTHWARD\r\n\r\nThe conquest of England, judged by its results, proved to be the most\r\nimportant undertaking of the Normans. But during this same eleventh\r\ncentury they found another field in which to display their energy and\r\ndaring. They turned southward to the Mediterranean and created a Norman\r\nstate in Italy and Sicily.\r\n\r\nCONQUESTS OF ROBERT GUISCARD\r\n\r\nThe unsettled condition of Italy [24] gave the Normans an opportunity for\r\ninterference in the affairs of the country. The founding of Norman power\r\nthere was largely the work of a noble named Robert Guiscard (\"the\r\nCrafty\"), a man almost as celebrated as William the Conqueror. He had set\r\nout from his home in Normandy with only a single follower, but his valor\r\nand shrewdness soon brought him to the front. Robert united the scattered\r\nbands of Normans in Italy, who were fighting for pay or plunder, and\r\nwrested from the Roman Empire in the East its last territories in the\r\npeninsula. Before his death (1085 A.D.) most of southern Italy had passed\r\nunder Norman rule.\r\n\r\nROGER GUISCARD'S CONQUESTS\r\n\r\nRobert's brother, Roger, crossed the strait of Messina and began the\r\nsubjugation of Sicily, then a Moslem possession. Its recovery from the\r\nhands of \"infidels\" was considered by the Normans a work both pleasing to\r\nGod and profitable to themselves. By the close of the eleventh century\r\nthey had finally established their rule in the island.\r\n\r\nKINGDOM OF THE TWO SICILIES\r\n\r\nThe conquests of the Normans in southern Italy and Sicily were united into\r\na single state, which came to be known as the kingdom of the Two Sicilies.\r\nThe Normans governed it for only about one hundred and fifty years, but\r\nunder other rulers it lasted until the middle of the nineteenth century,\r\nwhen the present kingdom of Italy came into existence.\r\n\r\nNORMAN CULTURE IN THE SOUTH\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of the Two Sicilies was well-governed, rich, and strong. Art\r\nand learning flourished in the cities of Naples, Salerno, and Palermo.\r\nSouthern Italy and Sicily under the Normans became a meeting-point of\r\nByzantine and Arabic civilization. The Norman kingdom formed an important\r\nchannel through which the wisdom of the East flowed to the North and to\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\n\r\n148. THE NORMANS IN EUROPEAN HISTORY\r\n\r\nNORMAN FACULTY OF ADAPTATION\r\n\r\nThe conquests of the Normans in England, Italy, and Sicily were effected\r\nafter they had become a Christian and a French-speaking people. In these\r\nlands they were the armed missionaries of a civilization not their own.\r\nThe Normans, indeed, invented little and borrowed much. But, like the\r\nArabs, they were more than simple imitators. In language, literature, art,\r\nreligion, and law what they took from others they improved and then spread\r\nabroad throughout their settlements.\r\n\r\nASSIMILATION OF THE NORMANS\r\n\r\nIt seems at first sight remarkable that a people who occupied so much of\r\nwestern Europe should have passed away. Normans as Normans no longer\r\nexist. They lost themselves in the kingdoms which they founded and among\r\nthe peoples whom they subdued. Their rapid assimilation was chiefly the\r\nconsequence of their small numbers: outside of Normandy they were too few\r\nlong to maintain their identity.\r\n\r\nNORMAL INFLUENCE\r\n\r\nIf the Normans themselves soon disappeared, their influence was more\r\nlasting. Their mission, it has been well said, was to be leaders and\r\nenergizers of society--\"the little leaven that leaveneth the whole lump.\"\r\nThe peoples of medieval Europe owed much to the courage and martial\r\nspirit, the genius for government, and the reverence for law, of the\r\nNormans. In one of the most significant movements of the Middle Ages--the\r\ncrusades--they took a prominent part. Hence we shall meet them again.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

RISE OF FEUDALISM\r\n\r\nA DARK AGE\r\n\r\nThe ninth century in western Europe was, as we have learned, [1] a period\r\nof violence, disorder, and even anarchy. Charlemagne for a time had\r\narrested the disintegration of society which resulted from the invasions\r\nof the Germans, and had united their warring tribes under something like a\r\ncentralized government. But his work, it has been well said, was only a\r\ndesperate rally in the midst of confusion. After his death the Carolingian\r\nEmpire, attacked by the Northmen and other invaders and weakened by civil\r\nconflicts, broke up into separate kingdoms.\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF ROYAL AUTHORITY\r\n\r\nCharlemagne's successors in France, Germany, and Italy enjoyed little real\r\nauthority. They reigned, but did not rule. Under the conditions of the\r\nage, it was impossible for a king to govern with a strong hand. The\r\nabsence of good roads or of other easy means of communication made it\r\ndifficult for him to move troops quickly from one district to another, in\r\norder to quell revolts. Even had good roads existed, the lack of ready\r\nmoney would have prevented him from maintaining a strong army devoted to\r\nhis interests. Moreover, the king's subjects, as yet not welded into a\r\nnation, felt toward him no sentiments of loyalty and affection. They cared\r\nfar less for their king, of whom they knew little, than for their own\r\nlocal lords who dwelt near them.\r\n\r\nINCREASED POWER OF THE NOBLES\r\n\r\nThe decline of the royal authority, from the ninth century onward, meant\r\nthat the chief functions of government would be more and more performed by\r\nthe nobles, who were the great landowners of the kingdom. Under\r\nCharlemagne these men had been the king's officials, appointed by him and\r\nholding office at his pleasure. Under his successors they tended to become\r\nalmost independent princes. In proportion as this change was accomplished\r\nduring the Middle Ages, European society entered upon the stage of\r\nfeudalism. [2]\r\n\r\nPARALLELS TO EUROPEAN FEUDALISM\r\n\r\nFeudalism in medieval Europe was not a unique development. Parallels to it\r\nmay be found in other parts of the world. Whenever the state becomes\r\nincapable of protecting life and property, powerful men in each locality\r\nwill themselves undertake this duty; they will assume the burden of their\r\nown defense and of those weaker men who seek their aid. Such was the\r\nsituation in ancient Egypt for several hundred years, in medieval Persia,\r\nand in modern Japan until about two generations ago.\r\n\r\nEXTENT OF EUROPEAN FEUDALISM\r\n\r\nEuropean feudalism arose and flourished in the three countries which had\r\nformed the Carolingian Empire, that is, in France, Germany, and northern\r\nItaly. It also spread to Bohemia, Hungary, and the Christian states of\r\nSpain. Toward the close of the eleventh century the Normans transplanted\r\nit into England, southern Italy, and Sicily. During the twelfth and\r\nthirteenth centuries the crusaders introduced it into the kingdoms which\r\nthey founded in the East. [3] Still later, in the fourteenth century, the\r\nScandinavian countries became acquainted with feudalism. Throughout this\r\nwide area the institution, though varying endlessly in details, presented\r\ncertain common features.\r\n\r\n\r\n150. FEUDALISM AS A SYSTEM OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nFEUDAL SOVEREIGNTY\r\n\r\nThe basis of feudal society was usually the landed estate. Here lived the\r\nfeudal noble, surrounded by dependents over whom he exercised the rights\r\nof a petty sovereign. He could tax them; he could require them to give him\r\nmilitary assistance; he could try them in his courts. A great noble, the\r\npossessor of many estates, even enjoyed the privilege of declaring war,\r\nmaking treaties, and coining money. How, it will be asked, did these\r\nrights and privileges arise?\r\n\r\nFEUDAL TENURE OF LAND\r\n\r\nOwing to the decay of commerce and industry, land had become practically\r\nthe only form of wealth in the early Middle Ages. The king, who in theory\r\nwas absolute owner of the soil, would pay his officials for their services\r\nby giving them the use of a certain amount of land. In the same way one\r\nwho had received large estates would parcel them out among his followers,\r\nin return for their support. Sometimes an unscrupulous noble might seize\r\nthe lands of his neighbors and compel them to become his tenants.\r\nSometimes, too, those who owned land in their own right might surrender\r\nthe title to it in favor of a noble, who then became their protector.\r\n\r\nTHE FIEF\r\n\r\nAn estate in land which a person held of a superior lord, on condition of\r\nperforming some \"honorable\" service, was called a fief. At first the\r\ntenant received the fief only for a specified term of years or for his\r\nlifetime; but in the end it became inheritable. On the death of the tenant\r\nhis eldest son succeeded him in possession. This right of the first-born\r\nson to the whole of the father's estate was known as primogeniture. [4] If\r\na man had no legal heir, the fief went back to its lord.\r\n\r\nVASSALAGE\r\n\r\nThe tie which bound the tenant who accepted a fief to the lord who granted\r\nit was called vassalage. Every holder of land was the vassal of some lord.\r\nAt the apex of the feudal pyramid stood the king, the supreme landlord,\r\nwho was supposed to hold his land from God; below the king stood the\r\ngreater lords (dukes, marquises, counts, and barons), with large estates;\r\nand below them stood the lesser lords, or knights, whose possessions were\r\ntoo small for further subdivision.\r\n\r\nPERSONAL SERVICES OF THE VASSAL\r\n\r\nThe vassal, first of all, owed various services to the lord. In time of\r\nwar he did garrison duty at the lord's castle and joined him in military\r\nexpeditions. In time of peace the vassal attended the lord on ceremonial\r\noccasions, gave him the benefit of his advice, when required, and helped\r\nhim as a judge in trying cases.\r\n\r\nTHE VASSAL'S MONEY PAYMENTS\r\n\r\nUnder certain circumstances the vassal was also compelled to make money\r\npayments. When a new heir succeeded to the fief, the lord received from\r\nhim a sum usually money equivalent to one year's revenue of the estate.\r\nThis payment was called a \"relief.\" Again, if a man sold his fief, the\r\nlord demanded another large sum from the purchaser, before giving his\r\nconsent to the transaction. Vassals were also expected to raise money for\r\nthe lord's ransom, in case he was made prisoner of war, to meet the\r\nexpenses connected with the knighting of his eldest son, and to provide a\r\ndowry for his eldest daughter. Such exceptional payments went by the name\r\nof \"aids.\"\r\n\r\nTHE LORD'S DUTY TO THE VASSAL\r\n\r\nThe vassal, in return for his services and payments, looked to the lord\r\nfor the protection of life and property. The lord agreed to secure him in\r\nthe enjoyment of his fief, to guard him against his enemies, and to see\r\nthat in all matters he received just treatment. This was no slight\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nHOMAGE\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of homage [5] symbolized the whole feudal relationship. One\r\nwho proposed to become a vassal and hold a fief came into the lord's\r\npresence, bareheaded and unarmed, knelt down, placed his hands between\r\nthose of the lord, and promised henceforth to become his \"man.\" The lord\r\nthen kissed him and raised him to his feet. After the ceremony the vassal\r\nplaced his hand upon the Bible or upon sacred relics and swore to remain\r\nfaithful to his lord. This was the oath of \"fealty.\" The lord then gave\r\nthe vassal some object--a stick, a clod of earth, a lance, or a glove--in\r\ntoken of the fief with the possession of which he was now \"invested.\"\r\n\r\nFEUDAL GOVERNMENT A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANARCHY\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the feudal method of land tenure, coupled with the custom\r\nof vassalage, made in some degree for security and order. Each noble was\r\nattached to the lord above him by the bond of personal service and the\r\noath of fidelity. To his vassals beneath him he was at once protector,\r\nbenefactor, and friend. Unfortunately, feudal obligations were far less\r\nstrictly observed in practice than in theory. Both lords and vassals often\r\nbroke their engagements, when it seemed profitable to do so. Hence they\r\nhad many quarrels and indulged in constant warfare. But feudalism, despite\r\nits defects, was better than anarchy. The feudal lords drove back the\r\npirates and hanged the brigands and enforced the laws, as no feeble king\r\ncould do. They provided a rude form of local government for a rude\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n151. FEUDAL JUSTICE\r\n\r\nFEUDALISM AS A SYSTEM OF LOCAL JUSTICE\r\n\r\nFeudalism was not only a system of local government; it was also a system\r\nof local justice. Knights, barons, counts, and dukes had their separate\r\ncourts, and the king had his court above all. Cases arising on the lord's\r\nestate were tried before him and the vassals whom he called to his\r\nassistance in giving justice. Since most wrongs could be atoned for by the\r\npayment of a fine, the conduct of justice on a large fief produced a\r\nconsiderable income. The nobles, accordingly, regarded their judicial\r\nrights as a valuable property, which they were loath to surrender to the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nJUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nThe law followed in a feudal court was largely based on old Germanic\r\ncustoms. The court did not act in the public interest, as with us, but\r\nwaited until the plaintiff requested service. Moreover, until the case had\r\nbeen decided, the accuser and the accused received the same treatment.\r\nBoth were imprisoned; and the plaintiff who lost his case suffered the\r\nsame penalty which the defendant, had he been found guilty, would have\r\nundergone.\r\n\r\nTHE OATH\r\n\r\nUnlike a modern court, again, the feudal court did not require the accuser\r\nto prove his case by calling witnesses and having them give testimony. The\r\nburden of proof lay on the accused, who had to clear himself of the\r\ncharge, if he could do so. In one form of trial it was enough for him to\r\ndeclare his innocence under oath, and then to bring in several \"oath-\r\nhelpers,\" sometimes relatives, but more often neighbors, who swore that\r\nthey believed him to be telling the truth. The number of these \"oath-\r\nhelpers\" varied according to the seriousness of the crime and the rank of\r\nthe accused. This method was hardly as unsatisfactory as it seems to be,\r\nfor a person of evil reputation might not be able to secure the required\r\nnumber of friends who would commit perjury on his behalf. To take an oath\r\nwas a very solemn proceeding; it was an appeal to God, by which a man\r\ncalled down on himself divine punishment if he swore falsely.\r\n\r\nORDEALS\r\n\r\nThe consequences of a false oath were not apparent at once. Ordeals,\r\nhowever, formed a method of appealing to God, the results of which could\r\nbe immediately observed. A common form of ordeal was by fire. The accused\r\nwalked barefoot over live brands, or stuck his hand into a flame, or\r\ncarried a piece of red-hot iron for a certain distance. In the ordeal by\r\nhot water he plunged his arm into boiling water. A man established his\r\ninnocence through one of these tests, if the wound healed properly after\r\nthree days. The ordeal by cold water rested on the belief that pure water\r\nwould reject the criminal. Hence the accused was thrown bound into a\r\nstream: if he floated he was guilty; if he sank he was innocent and had to\r\nbe rescued. Though a crude method of securing justice, ordeals were\r\ndoubtless useful in many instances. The real culprit would often prefer to\r\nconfess, rather than incur the anger of God by submitting to the test.\r\n\r\nTHE JUDICIAL DUEL\r\n\r\nA form of trial which especially appealed to the warlike nobles was the\r\njudicial duel. [6] The accuser and the accused fought with each other; and\r\nthe conqueror won the case. God, it was believed, would give victory to\r\nthe innocent party, because he had right on his side. When one of the\r\nadversaries could not fight, he secured a champion to take his place.\r\nThough the judicial duel finally went out of use in the law courts, it\r\nstill continued to be employed privately, as a means of settling disputes\r\nwhich involved a man's honor. The practice of dueling is only now dying\r\nout in civilized communities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRIAL BY COMBAT\r\nFrom a manuscript of the fifteenth century.]\r\n\r\nFEUDAL AND ROMAN LAW\r\n\r\nOaths, ordeals, and duels formed an inheritance from Germanic antiquity.\r\n[7] They offered a sharp contrast to Roman law, which acted in the public\r\ninterest, balanced evidence, and sought only to get at the truth. After\r\nthe middle of the twelfth century the revival of the study of Roman law,\r\nas embodied in Justinian's code, [8] led gradually to the abandonment of\r\nmost forms of appeal to the judgment of God. At the same time the kings\r\ngrew powerful enough to take into their own hands the administration of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n\r\n152. FEUDAL WARFARE\r\n\r\nFEUDALISM AS A SYSTEM OF LOCAL DEFENSE\r\n\r\nFeudalism, once more, was a system of local defense. The knight must guard\r\nhis small estate, the baron his barony, the count his county, the duke his\r\nduchy. At the lord's bidding the vassal had to follow him to war, either\r\nalone or with a certain number of men, according to the size of the fief.\r\nBut this assistance was limited. A vassal served only for a definite\r\nperiod (varying from one month to three in the year), and then only within\r\na reasonable distance from the lands for which he did homage. These\r\nrestrictions made it difficult to conduct a lengthy campaign, or one far\r\nremoved from the vassal's fief, unless mercenary soldiers were employed.\r\n\r\nTHE FEUDAL ARMY\r\n\r\nThe feudal army, as a rule, consisted entirely of cavalry. Such swiftly\r\nmoving assailants as the Northmen and the Magyars could best be dealt with\r\nby mounted men who could bring them to bay, compel them to fight, and\r\noverwhelm them by the shock of the charge. In this way the foot soldiers\r\nof Charlemagne's time came to be replaced by the mailed horsemen who for\r\nfour centuries or more dominated European battlefields.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNTED KNIGHT\r\nSeal of Robert Fitzwalter, showing a mounted knight in complete mail\r\narmor; date about 1265 A.D.]\r\n\r\nARMS AND ARMOR\r\n\r\nThe armor used in the Middle Ages was gradually perfected, until at length\r\nthe knight became a living fortress. [9] In the early feudal period he\r\nwore a cloth or leather tunic covered with iron rings or scales, and an\r\niron cap with a nose guard. About the beginning of the twelfth century he\r\nadopted chain mail, with a hood of the same material for the head. During\r\nthe fourteenth century the knight began to wear heavy plate armor,\r\nweighing fifty pounds or more, and a helmet with a visor which could be\r\nraised or lowered. Thus completely incased in metal, provided with shield,\r\nlance, straight sword or battle-ax, and mounted on a powerful horse, the\r\nknight could ride down almost any number of poorly armed peasants. Not\r\ntill the development of missile weapons--the longbow, and later the\r\nmusket--did the foot soldier resume his importance in warfare. The feudal\r\nage by this time was drawing to a close.\r\n\r\nPREVALENCE OF PRIVATE WAR\r\n\r\nThe nobles regarded the right of waging war on one another as their most\r\ncherished privilege. Fighting became almost a form of business enterprise,\r\nwhich enriched the lords and their retainers through the sack of castles,\r\nthe plunder of villages, and the ransom of prisoners. Every hill became a\r\nstronghold and every plain a battlefield. Such neighborhood warfare,\r\nthough rarely very bloody, spread terrible havoc throughout the land.\r\n\r\nTHE PEACE AND TRUCE OF GOD\r\n\r\nThe Church, to its great honor, lifted a protesting voice against this\r\nevil. It proclaimed a \"Peace of God\" and forbade attacks on all\r\ndefenseless people, including priests, monks, pilgrims, merchants,\r\npeasants, and women. But it was found impossible to prevent the feudal\r\nlords from warring with each other, even though they were threatened with\r\nthe eternal torments of Hell; and so the Church tried to restrict what it\r\ncould not altogether abolish. A \"Truce of God\" was established. All men\r\nwere to cease fighting from Wednesday evening to Monday morning of each\r\nweek, during Lent, and on various holy days. The truce would have given\r\nChristendom peace for about two hundred and forty days each year; but it\r\nseems never to have been strictly observed except in limited areas.\r\n\r\nABOLITION OF PRIVATE WARFARE\r\n\r\nAs the power of the kings increased in western Europe, they naturally\r\nsought to put an end to the constant fighting between their subjects. The\r\nNorman rulers of Normandy, England, and Sicily restrained their turbulent\r\nnobles with a strong hand. Peace came later in most parts of the\r\nContinent; in Germany, \"fist right\" (the rule of the strongest) prevailed\r\nuntil the end of the fifteenth century. The abolition of private war was\r\nthe first step in Europe toward universal peace. The second step--the\r\nabolition of public war between nations--is yet to be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n153. THE CASTLE AND LIFE OF THE NOBLES\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE CASTLE\r\n\r\nThe outward mark of feudalism was the castle, [10] where the lord resided\r\nand from which he ruled his fief. In its earliest form the castle was\r\nsimply a wooden blockhouse placed on a mound and surrounded by a stockade.\r\nAbout the beginning of the twelfth century the nobles began to build in\r\nstone, which would better resist fire and the assaults of besiegers. A\r\nstone castle consisted at first of a single tower, square or round, with\r\nthick walls, few windows, and often with only one room to each story. [11]\r\nAs engineering skill increased, several towers were built and were then\r\nconnected by outer and inner walls. The castle thus became a group of\r\nfortifications, which might cover a wide area.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF CHÂTEAU GAILLARD\r\nThe plan is intended to represent that of a typical castle, as the plan of\r\nKirkstall Abbey represents that of a typical monastery.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIERREFONDS\r\nA castle near Paris built about 1400 A.D. by a brother of the king of\r\nFrance. It was dismantled in 1632 A.D., but was carefully restored in the\r\nnineteenth century by order of Napoleon III. The exterior faithfully\r\nreproduces the appearance of a medieval fortress.]\r\n\r\nTHE CASTLE AS A FORTRESS\r\n\r\nDefense formed the primary purpose of the castle. Until the introduction\r\nof gunpowder and cannon, the only siege engines employed were those known\r\nin ancient times. They included machines for hurling heavy stones and iron\r\nbolts, battering rams, and movable towers, from which the besiegers\r\ncrossed over to the walls. Such engines could best be used on firm, level\r\nground. Consequently, a castle would often be erected on a high cliff or\r\nhill, or on an island, or in the center of a swamp. A castle without such\r\nnatural defenses would be surrounded by a deep ditch (the \"moat\"), usually\r\nfilled with water. If the besiegers could not batter down or undermine the\r\nmassive walls, they adopted the slower method of a blockade and tried to\r\nstarve the garrison into surrendering. But ordinarily a well-built, well-\r\nprovisioned castle was impregnable. Behind its frowning battlements even a\r\npetty lord could defy a royal army.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHÂTEAU GAILLARD (RESTORED)\r\nThe finest of all medieval castles. Located on a high hill overlooking the\r\nSeine about twenty miles from Rouen. Built by Richard the Lion hearted\r\nwithin a twelvemonth (1197-1198 AD) and by him called Saucy Castle. It was\r\ncaptured a few years later by the French king Philip Augustus and was\r\ndismantled early in the seventeenth century. The castle consisted of three\r\ndistinct series of fortifications, besides the keep which in this case was\r\nmerely a strong tower.]\r\n\r\nA CASTLE DESCRIBED\r\n\r\nA visitor to a medieval castle crossed the drawbridge over the moat and\r\napproached the narrow doorway, which was protected by a tower on each\r\nside. If he was admitted, the iron grating (\"portcullis\") rose slowly on\r\nits creaking pulleys, the heavy, wooden doors swung open, and he found\r\nhimself in the courtyard commanded by the great central tower (\"keep\"),\r\nwhere the lord and his family lived, especially in time of war. At the\r\nsummit of the keep rose a platform whence the sentinel surveyed the\r\ncountry far and wide; below, two stories underground, lay the prison,\r\ndark, damp, and dirty. As the visitor walked about the court-yard, he came\r\nupon the hall, used as the lord's residence in time of peace, the armory,\r\nthe chapel, the kitchens, and the stables. A spacious castle might\r\ncontain, in fact, all the buildings necessary for the support of the\r\nlord's servants and soldiers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING AND JESTER\r\nFrom a manuscript of the early fifteenth century.]\r\n\r\nTHE CASTLE AS A RESIDENCE\r\n\r\nThe medieval castle formed a good fortress, but a poor home. Its small\r\nrooms, lighted only by narrow windows, heated only by fireplaces, badly\r\nventilated, and provided with little furniture, must have been indeed\r\ncheerless. Toward the close of the feudal period, when life became more\r\nluxurious, the castle began to look less like a dungeon. Windows were\r\nwidened and provided with panes of painted glass, walls were hung with\r\ncostly tapestries, and floors were covered with thick Oriental rugs. The\r\nnobles became attached to their castle homes and often took their names\r\nfrom those of their estates.\r\n\r\nAMUSEMENTS OF THE NOBLES\r\n\r\nLife within the castle was very dull. There were some games, especially\r\nchess, which the nobles learned from the Moslems. Banqueting, however,\r\nformed the chief indoor amusement. The lord and his retainers sat down to\r\na gluttonous feast and, as they ate and drank, watched the pranks of a\r\nprofessional jester or listened to the songs and music of ministrels or,\r\nit may be, heard with wonder the tales of far-off countries brought by\r\nsome returning traveler. Outside castle walls a common sport was hunting\r\nin the forests and game preserves attached to every estate. Deer, bears,\r\nand wild boars were hunted with hounds; for smaller animals trained hawks,\r\nor falcons, were employed. But the nobles, as we have just seen, found in\r\nfighting their chief outdoor occupation and pastime. \"To play a great\r\ngame\" was their description of a battle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FALCONRY\r\nFrom a manuscript of the thirteenth century in the Bibliothèque Nationale,\r\nParis.]\r\n\r\n\r\n154. KNIGHTHOOD AND CHIVALRY\r\n\r\nAPPRENTICESHIP OF THE KNIGHT\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of warfare in feudal times made the use of arms a\r\nprofession requiring special training. A nobleman's son served for a\r\nnumber of years, first as a page, then as a squire, in his father's castle\r\nor in that of some other lord. He learned to manage a horse, to climb a\r\nscaling ladder, to wield sword, battle-ax, and lance. He also waited on\r\nthe lord's table, assisted him at his toilet, followed him in the chase,\r\nand attended him in battle. This apprenticeship usually lasted from five\r\nto seven years.\r\n\r\nCONFERRING OF KNIGHTHOOD\r\n\r\nWhen the young noble became of age, he might be made a knight, if he\r\ndeserved the honor and could afford the expense. The ceremony of\r\nconferring knighthood was often most elaborate. The candidate fasted, took\r\na bath--the symbol of purification--and passed the eve of his admission in\r\nprayer. Next morning he confessed his sins, went to Mass, and listened to\r\na sermon on the duties of knighthood. This ended, his father, or the noble\r\nwho had brought him up, girded him with a sword and gave him the\r\n\"accolade,\" that is, a blow on the neck or shoulder, at the same time\r\nsaying, \"Be thou a good knight.\" Then the youth, clad in shining armor and\r\nwearing golden spurs, mounted his horse and exhibited his skill in warlike\r\nexercises. If a squire for valorous conduct received knighthood on the\r\nbattlefield, the accolade by stroke of the sword formed the only ceremony.\r\n\r\nCHIVALRY\r\n\r\nIn course of time, as manners softened and Christian teachings began to\r\naffect feudal society, knighthood developed into chivalry. The Church,\r\nwhich opposed the warlike excesses of feudalism, took the knight under her\r\nwing and bade him be always a true soldier of Christ. To the rude virtues\r\nof fidelity to one's lord and bravery in battle, the Church added others.\r\nThe \"good knight\" was he who respected his sworn word, who never took an\r\nunfair advantage of another, who defended women, widows, and orphans\r\nagainst their oppressors, and who sought to make justice and right prevail\r\nin the world. Chivalry thus marked the union of pagan and Christian\r\nvirtues, of Christianity and the profession of arms.\r\n\r\nTHE CHIVALRIC CODE\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the \"good knight\" appears rather in romance than in sober\r\nhistory. Such a one was Sir Lancelot, in the stories of King Arthur and\r\nthe Round Table. [12] As Sir Lancelot lies in death, a former companion\r\naddresses him in words which sum up the best in the chivalric code: \"'Thou\r\nwert the courtliest knight that ever bare shield; and thou wert the truest\r\nfriend to thy lover that ever bestrode horse; and thou wert the truest\r\nlover among sinful men that ever loved woman; and thou wert the kindest\r\nman that ever struck with sword; and thou wert the goodliest person that\r\never came among press of knights; and thou wert the meekest man, and the\r\ngentlest, that ever ate in hall among ladies; and thou wert the sternest\r\nknight to thy mortal foe that ever put spear in the rest.'\" [13]\r\n\r\nJOUSTS AND TOURNAMENTS\r\n\r\nThe all-absorbing passion for fighting led to the invention of mimic\r\nwarfare in the shape of jousts and tournaments. [14] These exercises\r\nformed the medieval equivalent of the Greek athletic games and the Roman\r\ngladiatorial shows. The joust was a contest between two knights; the\r\ntournament, between two bands of knights. The contests took place in a\r\nrailed-off space, called the \"lists,\" about which the spectators gathered.\r\nEach knight wore upon his helmet the scarf or color of his lady and fought\r\nwith her eyes upon him. Victory went to the one who unhorsed his opponent\r\nor broke in the proper manner the greatest number of lances. The beaten\r\nknight forfeited horse and armor and had to pay a ransom to the conqueror.\r\nSometimes he lost his life, especially when the participants fought with\r\nreal weapons and not with blunted lances and pointless swords. The Church\r\nnow and then tried to stop these performances, but they remained\r\nuniversally popular until the close of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF CHIVALRY\r\n\r\nChivalry arose with feudalism, formed, in fact, the religion of feudalism,\r\nand passed away only when the changed conditions of society made feudalism\r\nan anachronism. [15] While chivalry lasted, it produced some improvement\r\nin manners, particularly by insisting on the notion of personal honor and\r\nby fostering greater regard for women (though only for those of the upper\r\nclass). Our modern notion of the conduct befitting a \"gentleman\" goes back\r\nto the old chivalric code. Chivalry expressed, however, simply the\r\nsentiments of the warlike nobles. It was an aristocratic ideal. The knight\r\ndespised and did his best to keep in subjection the toiling peasantry,\r\nupon whose backs rested the real burden of feudal society.\r\n\r\n\r\n155. FEUDALISM AS A SYSTEM OF LOCAL INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF URBAN LIFE\r\n\r\nUnder the Roman Empire western Europe had been filled with flourishing\r\ncities. [16] The Germanic invasions led to a gradual decay of trade and\r\nmanufacturing, and hence of the cities in which these activities centered.\r\nAs urban life declined, the mass of the population came to live more and\r\nmore in isolated rural communities. This was the great economic feature of\r\nthe early Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nFEUDALISM AND RURAL LIFE\r\n\r\nThe introduction of feudalism fostered the movement from town to country,\r\nfor feudalism, as has been shown, rested on the soil as its basis. The\r\nlord, his family, his servants, and his retainers were supported by the\r\nincome from landed property. The country estate of a lord was known as a\r\nmanor.\r\n\r\nTHE MANOR\r\n\r\nA manor naturally varied in size, according to the wealth of its lord. In\r\nEngland perhaps six hundred acres represented the extent of an average\r\nestate. Every noble had at least one manor; great nobles might have\r\nseveral manors, usually scattered throughout the country; and even the\r\nking depended on his many manors for the food supply of the court.\r\nEngland, during the period following the Norman Conquest, contained more\r\nthan nine thousand of these manorial estates. [17]\r\n\r\nCOMMON CULTIVATION OF THE ARABLE LAND\r\n\r\nOf the arable land of the manor the lord reserved as much as needful for\r\nhis own use. The lord's land was called his \"demesne,\" or domain. The rest\r\nof the land he allotted to the peasants who were his tenants, They\r\ncultivated their holdings in common. A farmer, instead of having his land\r\nin one compact mass, had it split up into a large number of small strips\r\n(usually about half an acre each) scattered over the manor, and separated,\r\nnot by fences or hedges, but by banks of unplowed turf. The appearance of\r\na manor, when under cultivation, has been likened to a vast checkerboard\r\nor a patchwork quilt. [18] The reason for the intermixture of strips seems\r\nto have been to make sure that each farmer had a portion both of the good\r\nland and of the bad. It is obvious that this arrangement compelled all the\r\npeasants to labor according to a common plan. A man had to sow the same\r\nkinds of crops as his neighbors, and to till and reap them at the same\r\ntime. Agriculture, under such circumstances, could not fail to be\r\nunprogressive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FARM WORK IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY\r\nPlowing, Harrowing, Cutting Weeds, Reaping.]\r\n\r\nFARMING METHODS\r\n\r\nIn other ways, too, agriculture was very backward. Farmers did not know\r\nhow to enrich the soil by the use of fertilizers or how to provide for a\r\nproper rotation of crops. Hence each year they cultivated only two-thirds\r\nof the land, letting the other third lie \"fallow\" (uncultivated), that it\r\nmight recover its fertility. It is said that eight or nine bushels of\r\ngrain represented the average yield of an acre. Farm animals were small,\r\nfor scientific breeding had not yet begun. A full-grown ox reached a size\r\nscarcely larger than a calf of to-day, and the fleece of a sheep often\r\nweighed less than two ounces. Farm implements were few and clumsy. The\r\nwooden ploughs only scratched the ground. Harrowing was done with a hand\r\nimplement little better than a large rake. Grain was cut with a sickle,\r\nand grass was mown with a scythe. It took five men a day to reap and bind\r\nthe harvest of two acres.\r\n\r\nCOMMON USE OF THE NON-ARABLE LAND\r\n\r\nBesides his holding of farm land, which in England averaged about thirty\r\nacres, each peasant had certain rights over the non-arable land of the\r\nmanor. He could cut a limited amount of hay from the meadow. He could turn\r\nso many farm animals--cattle, geese, swine--on the waste. He also enjoyed\r\nthe privilege of taking so much wood from the forest for fuel and building\r\npurposes. A peasant's holding, which also included a house in the village,\r\nthus formed a complete outfit.\r\n\r\n\r\n156. THE VILLAGE AND LIFE OF THE PEASANTS\r\n\r\nA VILLAGE DESCRIBED\r\n\r\nThe peasants on a manor lived close together in one or more villages.\r\nTheir small, thatch-roofed, and one-roomed houses would be grouped about\r\nan open space (the \"green\"), or on both sides of a single, narrow street.\r\nThe only important buildings were the parish church, the parsonage, a\r\nmill, if a stream ran through the manor, and possibly a blacksmith's shop.\r\nThe population of one of these villages often did not exceed one hundred\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nA VILLAGE AS SELF-SUFFICING\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking feature of a medieval village was its self-\r\nsufficiency. The inhabitants tried to produce at home everything they\r\nrequired, in order to avoid the uncertainty and expense of trade. The land\r\ngave them their food; the forest provided them with wood for houses and\r\nfurniture. They made their own clothes of flax, wool, and leather. Their\r\nmeal and flour were ground at the village mill, and at the village smithy\r\ntheir farm implements were manufactured. The chief articles which needed\r\nto be brought from some distant market were salt, used to salt down farm\r\nanimals killed in autumn, iron for various tools, and millstones. Cattle,\r\nhorses, and surplus grain also formed common objects of exchange between\r\nmanors.\r\n\r\nHARD LOT OF THE PEASANTRY\r\n\r\nLife in a medieval village was rude and rough. The peasants labored from\r\nsunrise to sunset, ate coarse fare, lived in huts, and suffered from\r\nfrequent pestilences. They were often the helpless prey of the feudal\r\nnobles. If their lord happened to be a quarrelsome man, given to fighting\r\nwith his neighbors, they might see their lands ravaged, their cattle\r\ndriven off, their village burned, and might themselves be slain. Even\r\nunder peaceful conditions the narrow, shut-in life of the manor could not\r\nbe otherwise than degrading.\r\n\r\nALLEVIATIONS OF THE PEASANT'S LOT\r\n\r\nYet there is another side to the picture. If the peasants had a just and\r\ngenerous lord, they probably led a fairly comfortable existence. Except\r\nwhen crops failed, they had an abundance of food, and possibly wine or\r\ncider drink. They shared a common life in the work of the fields, in the\r\nsports of the village green, and in the services of the parish church.\r\nThey enjoyed many holidays; it has been estimated that, besides Sundays,\r\nabout eight weeks in every year were free from work. Festivities at\r\nChristmas, Easter, and May Day, at the end of ploughing and the completion\r\nof harvest, relieved the monotony of the daily round of labor. [19]\r\nPerhaps these medieval peasants were not much worse off than the\r\nagricultural laborers in most countries of modern Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF HITCHIN MANOR, HERTFORDSHIRE\r\nLord's demesne, diagonal lines. Meadow and pasture lands, dotted areas.\r\nNormal holding of a peasant, black strips.]\r\n\r\n\r\n157. SERFDOM\r\n\r\nFREEMEN, SLAVES, AND SERFS\r\n\r\nA medieval village usually contained several classes of laborers. There\r\nmight be a number of freemen, who paid a fixed rent, either in money or\r\nproduce, for the use of their land. Then there might also be a few slaves\r\nin the lord's household or at work on his domain. By this time, however,\r\nslavery had about died out in western Europe. Most of the peasants were\r\nserfs.\r\n\r\nNATURE OF SERFDOM\r\n\r\nSerfdom represented a stage between slavery and freedom. A slave belonged\r\nto his master; he was bought and sold like other chattels. A serf had a\r\nhigher position, for he could not be sold apart from the land nor could\r\nhis holding be taken from him. He was fixed to the soil. On the other hand\r\na serf ranked lower than a freeman, because he could not change his abode,\r\nnor marry outside the manor, nor bequeath his goods, without the\r\npermission of his lord.\r\n\r\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE SERF\r\n\r\nThe serf did not receive his land as a free gift; for the use of it he\r\nowed certain duties to his master. These took chiefly the form of personal\r\nservices. He must labor on the lord's domain for two or three days each\r\nweek, and at specially busy seasons, such as ploughing and harvesting, he\r\nmust do extra work. At least half his time was usually demanded by the\r\nlord. The serf had also to make certain payments, either in money or more\r\noften in grain, honey, eggs, or other produce. When he ground the wheat or\r\npressed the grapes which grew on his land, he must use the lord's mill,\r\nthe lord's wine-press, and pay the customary charge. In theory the lord\r\ncould tax his serfs as heavily and make them work as hard as he pleased,\r\nbut the fear of losing his tenants doubtless in most cases prevented him\r\nfrom imposing too great burdens on them.\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF SERFDOM\r\n\r\nSerfdom developed during the later centuries of the Roman Empire and in\r\nthe early Middle Ages. It was well established by the time of Charlemagne.\r\nMost serfs seem to have been the descendants, or at least the successors,\r\nof Roman slaves, whose condition had gradually improved. The serf class\r\nwas also recruited from the ranks of freemen, who by conquest or because\r\nof the desire to gain the protection of a lord, became subject to him.\r\nSerfdom, however, was destined to be merely a transitory condition. By the\r\nclose of medieval times, the serfs in most parts of western Europe had\r\nsecured their freedom. [20]\r\n\r\n\r\n158. DECLINE OF FEUDALISM\r\n\r\nDURATION OF FEUDALISM\r\n\r\nFeudalism had a vigorous life for about five hundred years. Taking\r\ndefinite form early in the ninth century, it flourished throughout the\r\nlater Middle Ages, but became decadent by the opening of the fourteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nFORCES OPPOSED TO FEUDALISM: THE KINGS\r\n\r\nAs a system of local government, feudalism tended to pass away when the\r\nrulers in England, France, and Spain, and later in Germany and Italy,\r\nbecame powerful enough to put down private warfare, execute justice, and\r\nmaintain order everywhere in their dominions. The kings were always anti-\r\nfeudal. We shall study in a later chapter (Chapter XXII) the rise of\r\nstrong governments and centralized states in western Europe.\r\n\r\nFORCES OPPOSED TO FEUDALISM: THE CITIES\r\n\r\nAs a system of local industry, feudalism could not survive the great\r\nchanges of the later Middle Ages, when reviving trade, commerce, and\r\nmanufactures had begun to lead to the increase of wealth, the growth of\r\nmarkets, and the substitution of money payments for those in produce or\r\nservices. Flourishing cities arose, as in the days of the Roman Empire,\r\nfreed themselves from the control of the nobles, and became the homes of\r\nliberty and democracy. The cities, like the kings, were always anti-\r\nfeudal. We shall deal with their development in a subsequent chapter\r\n(Chapter XXIII).\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH AND FEUDALISM\r\n\r\nThere was still another anti-feudal force, namely, the Roman Church. It is\r\ntrue that many of the higher clergy were feudal lords, and that even the\r\nmonasteries owned vast estates which were parceled out among tenants.\r\nNevertheless, the Roman Church as a universal organization, including men\r\nof all ranks and classes, was necessarily opposed to feudalism, a local\r\nand an aristocratic system. The work and influence of this Church will now\r\nengage our attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1. Write a brief essay on feudal society, using the following words: lord;\r\nvassal; castle; keep; dungeon; chivalry; tournament; manor; and serf.\r\n\r\n2. Explain the following terms: vassal; fief; serf; \"aid\"; homage; squire;\r\ninvestiture; and \"relief.\"\r\n\r\n3. Look up the origin of the words homage, castle, dungeon, and chivalry.\r\n\r\n4. \"The real heirs of Charlemagne were from the first neither the kings of\r\nFrance nor those of Italy or Germany; but the feudal lords.\" Comment on\r\nthis statement.\r\n\r\n5. Why was the feudal system not found in the Roman Empire in the East\r\nduring the Middle Ages?\r\n\r\n6. Why has feudalism been called \"confusion roughly organized\"?\r\n\r\n7. Contrast feudalism as a political system with (a) the classical city-\r\nstates, (b) the Roman Empire, and (c) modern national states.\r\n\r\n8. What was the effect of feudalism on the sentiment of patriotism?\r\n\r\n9. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of primogeniture as\r\nthe rule of inheritance?\r\n\r\n10. Explain these phrases: \"to be in hot water;\" \"to go through fire and\r\nwater;\" and \"to haul over the coals.\"\r\n\r\n11. Compare the oaths administered to witnesses in modern courts with\r\nmedieval oaths.\r\n\r\n12. Why was war the usual condition of feudal society?\r\n\r\n13. Compare the \"Peace of God\" with the earlier \"Roman Peace\" (_Pax\r\nRomana_).\r\n\r\n14. Mention some modern comforts and luxuries which were unknown in feudal\r\ncastles.\r\n\r\n15. What is the present meaning of the word \"chivalrous\"? How did it get\r\nthat meaning?\r\n\r\n16. Why has chivalry been called \"the blossom of feudalism\"?\r\n\r\n17. Contrast the ideal of a chivalry with that of monasticism.\r\n\r\n18. Show that the serf was not a slave or a \"hired man\" or a tenant-farmer\r\npaying rent.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] See page 312.\r\n\r\n[2] The word has nothing to do with \"feuds,\" though these were common\r\nenough in feudal times. It comes from the medieval Latin _feudum_, from\r\nwhich are desired the French _fief_ and the English _fee_.\r\n\r\n[3] See pages 472, 478.\r\n\r\n[4] The practice of primogeniture has now been abolished by the laws of\r\nthe various European countries and is not recognized in the United States.\r\nIt still prevails, however, in England.\r\n\r\n[5] Latin _homo_, \"man.\"\r\n\r\n[6] Sir Walter Scott's novel, _Ivanhoe_ (chapter xliii), contains an\r\naccount of a judicial duel.\r\n\r\n[7] See page 326.\r\n\r\n[8] See page 331.\r\n\r\n[9] See the illustrations, pages 408, 421, 422, 473.\r\n\r\n[10] The French form of the word is _château_.\r\n\r\n[11] A good example is the \"White Tower,\" which forms a part of the Tower\r\nof London.

[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n159. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN CHURCH\r\n\r\nA preceding chapter dealt with the Christian Church in the East and West\r\nduring the early Middle Ages. We learned something about its organization,\r\nbelief, and worship, about the rise and growth of the Papacy, about\r\nmonasticism, and about that missionary campaign which won all Europe to\r\nChristianity. Our narrative extended to the middle of the eleventh\r\ncentury, when the quarrel between pope and patriarch led at length to the\r\ndisruption of Christendom. We have now to consider the work and influence\r\nof the Roman Church during later centuries of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nTERRITORIAL EXTENT OF THE CHURCH\r\n\r\nThe Church at the height of its power held spiritual sway over all western\r\nEurope. Italy and Sicily, the larger part of Spain, France, Germany,\r\nHungary, Poland, British Isles, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland\r\nyielded obedience to the pope of Rome.\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH AS UNIVERSAL\r\n\r\nMembership in the Church was not a matter of free choice. All people,\r\nexcept Jews, were required to belong to it. A person joined the Church by\r\nbaptism, a rite usually performed in infancy, and remained in it as long\r\nas he lived. Every one was expected to conform, at least outwardly, to the\r\ndoctrines and practices of the Church, and anyone attacking its authority\r\nwas liable to punishment by the state.\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH AS INTERNATIONAL\r\n\r\nThe presence of one Church throughout the western world furnished a bond\r\nof union between European peoples during the age of feudalism. The Church\r\ntook no heed of political boundaries, for men of all nationalities entered\r\nthe ranks of the priesthood and joined the monastic orders. Priests and\r\nmonks were subjects of no country, but were \"citizens of heaven,\" as they\r\nsometimes called themselves. Even difference of language counted for\r\nlittle in the Church, since Latin was the universal speech of the educated\r\nclasses. One must think, then, of the Church as a great international\r\nstate, in form a monarchy, presided over by the pope, and with its capital\r\nat Rome.\r\n\r\nTWOFOLD DUTIES OF THE CHURCH\r\n\r\nThe Church in the Middle Ages performed a double task. On the one hand it\r\ngave the people religious instruction and watched over their morals; on\r\nthe other hand it played an important part in European politics and\r\nprovided a means of government. Because the Church thus combined\r\necclesiastical and civil functions, it was quite unlike all modern\r\nchurches, whether Greek, Roman, or Protestant. Both sides of its\r\nactivities deserve, therefore, to be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n160. CHURCH DOCTRINE AND WORSHIP\r\n\r\n\"THE GATE OF HEAVEN.\"\r\n\r\nIn medieval times every loyal member of the Church accepted without\r\nquestion its authority in religious matters. The Church taught a belief in\r\na personal God, all-wise, all-good, all-powerful, to know whom was the\r\nhighest goal of life. The avenue to this knowledge lay through faith in\r\nthe revelation of God, as found in the Scriptures. Since the unaided human\r\nreason could not properly interpret the Scriptures, it was necessary for\r\nthe Church, through her officers, to declare their meaning and set forth\r\nwhat doctrines were essential to salvation. The Church thus appeared as\r\nthe sole repository of religious knowledge, as \"the gate of heaven.\"\r\n\r\nTHE SACRAMENTAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\nSalvation did not depend only on the acceptance of certain beliefs. There\r\nwere also certain acts, called \"sacraments,\" in which the faithful\r\nChristian must participate, if he was not to be cut off eternally from\r\nGod. These acts formed channels of heavenly grace; they saved man from the\r\nconsequences of his sinful nature and filled him with \"the fullness of\r\ndivine life.\" Since priests alone could administer the sacraments, [2] the\r\nChurch presented itself as the necessary mediator between God and man.\r\n\r\nBAPTISM, CONFIRMATION, MATRIMONY, AND EXTREME UNCTION\r\n\r\nBy the thirteenth century seven sacraments were generally recognized. Four\r\nof these marked critical stages in human life, from the cradle to the\r\ngrave. Baptism cleansed the child from the taint of original sin and\r\nadmitted him into the Christian community. Confirmation gave him full\r\nChurch fellowship. Matrimony united husband and wife in holy bonds which\r\nmight never be broken. Extreme Unction, the anointing with oil of one\r\nmortally ill, purified the soul and endowed it with strength to meet\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nPENANCE\r\n\r\nPenance held an especially important place in the sacramental system. At\r\nleast once a year the Christian must confess his sins to a priest. If he\r\nseemed to be truly repentant, the priest pronounced the solemn words of\r\nabsolution and then required him to accept some punishment, which varied\r\naccording to the nature of the offense. There was a regular code of\r\npenalties for such sins as drunkenness, avarice, perjury, murder, and\r\nheresy. Penances often consisted in fasting, reciting prayers, abstaining\r\nfrom one's ordinary amusements, or beating oneself with bundles of rods. A\r\nman who had sinned grievously might be ordered to engage in charitable\r\nwork, to make a contribution in money for the support of the Church, or to\r\ngo on a pilgrimage to a sacred shrine. The more distant and difficult a\r\npilgrimage, the more meritorious it was, especially if it led to some very\r\nholy place, such as Rome or Jerusalem. People might also become monks in\r\norder to atone for evil-doing. This system of penitential punishment\r\nreferred only to the earthly life; it was not supposed to cleanse the soul\r\nfor eternity.\r\n\r\nHOLY EUCHARIST\r\n\r\nThe sacrament of the Holy Eucharist, generally known as the Mass, formed\r\nthe central feature of worship. It was more than a common meal in\r\ncommemoration of the Last Supper of Christ with the Apostles. It was a\r\nsolemn ceremony, by which the Christian believed himself to receive the\r\nbody and blood of Christ, under the form of bread and wine. [3] The right\r\nof the priest to withhold the Eucharist from any person, for good cause,\r\ngave the Church great power, because the failure to partake of this\r\nsacrament imperiled one's chances of future salvation. It was also\r\nsupposed that the benefits of the ceremony in purifying from sin might be\r\nenjoyed by the dead in Purgatory; hence masses were often said for the\r\nrepose of their souls.\r\n\r\nORDINATION\r\n\r\nThe seventh and last sacrament, that of Ordination, or \"Holy Orders,\"\r\nadmitted persons to the priesthood. According to the view of the Church\r\nthe rite had been instituted by Christ, when He chose the Apostles and\r\nsent them forth to preach the Gospel. From the Apostles, who ordained\r\ntheir successors, the clergy in all later times received their exalted\r\nauthority. [4] Ordination conferred spiritual power and set such an\r\nindelible mark on the character that one who had been ordained could never\r\nbecome a simple layman again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PILGRIMS TO CANTERBURY\r\nFrom a medieval manuscript. Canterbury with its cathedral appears in the\r\nbackground. The shrine of Thomas Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, formed\r\na celebrated resort for medieval pilgrims. The archbishop had been\r\nmurdered in the church (1180 A.D.), if not at the instigation, at any rate\r\nwithout the opposition of King Henry II, whose policies he opposed.\r\nBecket, who was regarded as a martyr, soon received canonization. Miracles\r\nwere said to be worked at his grave and at the well in which his bloody\r\ngarments had been washed. He remained the most popular saint in England\r\nuntil the Protestant Reformation in the sixteenth century, when his shrine\r\nwas destroyed.]\r\n\r\nREVERENCE FOR SAINTS\r\n\r\nThe Church did not rely solely on the sacramental system as a means to\r\nsalvation. It was believed that holy persons, called saints, [5] who had\r\ndied and gone to Heaven, offered to God their prayers for men. Hence the\r\npractice arose of invoking the aid of the saints in all the concerns of\r\nlife. The earliest saints were Christian martyrs, [6] who had sealed their\r\nfaith with their blood. In course of time many other persons, renowned for\r\npious deeds, were exalted to sainthood. The making of a new saint, after a\r\nrigid inquiry into the merits of the person whom it is proposed to honor,\r\nis now a privilege reserved to the pope.\r\n\r\nDEVOTION TO THE VIRGIN\r\n\r\nHigh above all the saints stood the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God.\r\nDevotion to her as the \"Queen of Heaven\" increased rapidly in the Church\r\nafter the time of Gregory the Great. The popularity of her cult owed not a\r\nlittle to the influence of chivalry, [7] for the knight, who vowed to\r\ncherish womanhood, saw in the Virgin the ideal woman. Everywhere churches\r\narose in her honor, and no cathedral or abbey lacked a chapel dedicated to\r\nOur Lady.\r\n\r\nRELICS\r\n\r\nThe growing reverence for saints led to an increased interest in relics.\r\nThese included the bones of a saint and shreds of his garments, besides\r\nsuch objects as the wood or nails of the cross on which Christ suffered.\r\nRelics were not simply mementos; they were supposed to possess miraculous\r\npower which passed into them through contact with holy persons. This\r\nbelief explains the use of relics to heal diseases, to ward off danger,\r\nand, in general, to bring good fortune. An oath taken upon relics was\r\nespecially sacred. [8] Every church building contained a collection of\r\nrelics, sometimes amounting to thousands in number, and even private\r\npersons often owned them.\r\n\r\nPURGATORY\r\n\r\nThe Church also taught a belief in Purgatory as a state or place of\r\nprobation. [9] Here dwelt the souls of those who were guilty of no mortal\r\nsins which would condemn them to Hell, but yet were burdened with\r\nimperfections which prevented them from entering Heaven. Such\r\nimperfections, it was held, might be removed by the prayers of the living,\r\nand hence the practice arose of praying for the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n161. CHURCH JURISDICTION\r\n\r\nCHURCH COURTS\r\n\r\nThe Church had regular courts and a special system of law [10] for the\r\ntrial of offenders against its regulations. Many cases, which to-day would\r\nbe decided according to the civil or criminal law of the state, in the\r\nMiddle Ages came before the ecclesiastical courts. Since marriage was\r\nconsidered a sacrament, the Church took upon itself to decide what\r\nmarriages were lawful. It forbade the union of first cousins, of second\r\ncousins, and of godparents and godchildren. It refused to sanction\r\ndivorce, for whatever cause, if both parties at the time of marriage had\r\nbeen baptized Christians. The Church dealt with inheritance under wills,\r\nfor a man could not make a legal will until he had confessed, and\r\nconfession formed part of the sacrament of Penance. All contracts made\r\nbinding by oaths came under Church jurisdiction, because an oath was an\r\nappeal to God. [11] The Church tried those who were charged with any sin\r\nagainst religion, including heresy, blasphemy, the taking of interest\r\n(usury), and the practice of witchcraft. Widows, orphans, and the families\r\nof pilgrims or crusaders also enjoyed the special protection of Church\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\n\"BENEFIT OF CLERGY\"\r\n\r\nThe Church claimed the privilege of judging all cases which involved\r\nclergymen. No layman, it was declared, ought to interfere with one who, by\r\nthe sacrament of Ordination, had been dedicated to God. This demand of the\r\nChurch to try its own officers, according to its own mild and intelligent\r\nlaws, seems not unreasonable, when we remember how rude were the methods\r\nof feudal justice. But \"benefit of clergy,\" as the privilege was called,\r\nmight be abused. Many persons who had no intention of acting as priests or\r\nmonks became clergymen, in order to shield themselves behind the Church in\r\ncase their misdeeds were exposed.\r\n\r\nRIGHT OF \"SANCTUARY.\"\r\n\r\nAn interesting illustration of the power of the Church is afforded by the\r\nright of \"sanctuary.\" Any lawbreaker who fled to a church building\r\nenjoyed, for a limited time, the privilege of safe refuge. It was\r\nconsidered a sin against God to drag even the most wicked criminal from\r\nthe altar. The most that could be done was to deny the refugee food, so\r\nthat he might come forth voluntarily. This privilege of seeking sanctuary\r\nwas not without social usefulness, for it gave time for angry passions to\r\ncool, thus permitting an investigation of the charges against an offender.\r\n\r\nEXCOMMUNICATION\r\n\r\nDisobedience to the regulations of the Church might be followed by\r\nexcommunication. It was a punishment which cut off the offender from all\r\nChristian fellowship. He could not attend religious services nor enjoy the\r\nsacraments so necessary to salvation. If he died excommunicate, his body\r\ncould not be buried in consecrated ground. By the law of the state he lost\r\nall civil rights and forfeited all his property. No one might speak to\r\nhim, feed him, or shelter him. This terrible penalty, it is well to point\r\nout, was usually imposed only after the sinner had received a fair trial\r\nand had spurned all entreaties to repent. [12]\r\n\r\nINTERDICT\r\n\r\nThe interdict, another form of punishment, was directed against a\r\nparticular locality, for the fault of some of the inhabitants who could\r\nnot be reached directly. In time of interdict the priests closed the\r\nchurches and neither married the living nor buried the dead. Of the\r\nsacraments only Baptism, Confirmation, and Penance were permitted. All the\r\ninhabitants of the afflicted district were ordered to fast, as in Lent,\r\nand to let their hair grow long in sign of mourning. The interdict also\r\nstopped the wheels of government, for courts of justice were shut, wills\r\ncould not be made, and public officials were forbidden to perform their\r\nduties. In some cases the Church went so far as to lay an interdict upon\r\nan entire kingdom, whose ruler had refused to obey her mandate. [13] The\r\ninterdict has now passed out of use, but excommunication still retains its\r\nplace among the spiritual weapons of the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n162. THE SECULAR CLERGY\r\n\r\nTHE SECULAR AND REGULAR CLERGY\r\n\r\nSome one has said that in the Middle Ages there were just three classes of\r\nsociety: the nobles who fought; the peasants who worked; and the clergy\r\nwho prayed. The latter class was divided into the secular [14] clergy,\r\nincluding deacons, priests, and bishops, who lived active lives in the\r\nworld, and the regular [15] clergy, or monks, who passed their days in\r\nseclusion behind monastery walls.\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE CLERGY\r\n\r\nIt has been already pointed out how early both secular and regular clergy\r\ncame to be distinguished from the laity by abstention from money-making\r\nactivities, differences in dress, and the obligation of celibacy. [16]\r\nBeing unmarried, the clergy had no family cares; being free from the\r\nnecessity of earning their own living, they could devote all their time\r\nand energy to the service of the Church. The sacrament of Ordination,\r\nwhich was believed to endow the clergy with divine power, also helped to\r\nstrengthen their influence. They appeared as a distinct order, in whose\r\ncharge was the care of souls and in whose hands were the keys of heaven.\r\n\r\nPARISH PRIESTS\r\n\r\nAn account of the secular clergy naturally begins with the parish priest,\r\nwho had charge of a parish, the smallest division of Christendom. No one\r\ncould act as a priest without the approval of the bishop, but the nobleman\r\nwho supported the parish had the privilege of nominating candidates for\r\nthe position. The priest derived his income from lands belonging to the\r\nparish, from tithes, [17] and from voluntary contributions, but as a rule\r\nhe received little more than a bare living. The parish priest was the only\r\nChurch officer who came continually into touch with the common people. He\r\nbaptized, married, and buried his parishioners. For them he celebrated\r\nMass at least once a week, heard confessions, and granted absolution. He\r\nwatched over all their deeds on earth and prepared them for the life to\r\ncome. And if he preached little, he seldom failed to set in his own person\r\nan example of right living.\r\n\r\nTHE PARISH CHURCH\r\n\r\nThe church, with its spire which could be seen afar off and its bells\r\nwhich called the faithful to worship, formed the social center of the\r\nparish. Here on Sundays and holy days the people assembled for the morning\r\nand evening services. During the interval between religious exercises they\r\noften enjoyed games and other amusements in the adjoining churchyard. As a\r\nplace of public gathering the parish church held an important place in the\r\nlife of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nBISHOPS\r\n\r\nA group of parishes formed a diocese, over which a bishop presided. It was\r\nhis business to look after the property belonging to the diocese, to hold\r\nthe ecclesiastical courts, to visit the clergy, and to see that they did\r\ntheir duty. The bishop alone could administer the sacraments of\r\nConfirmation and Ordination. He also performed the ceremonies at the\r\nconsecration of a new church edifice or shrine. Since the Church held vast\r\nestates on feudal tenure, the bishop was usually a territorial lord, owing\r\na vassal's obligations to the king or to some powerful noble for his land\r\nand himself ruling over vassals in different parts of the country. As\r\nsymbols of his power and dignity the bishop wore on his head the miter and\r\ncarried the pastoral staff, or crosier. [18]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BISHOP ORDAINING A PRIEST\r\nFrom an English manuscript of the twelfth century. The bishop wears a\r\nmiter and holds in his left hand the pastoral staff, or crosier. His right\r\nhand is extended in blessing over the priest's head.]\r\n\r\nARCHBISHOPS\r\n\r\nAbove the bishop in rank stood the archbishop. In England, for example,\r\nthere were two archbishops, one residing at York and the other at\r\nCanterbury. The latter, as \"primate of all England,\" was the highest\r\necclesiastical dignitary in the land. An archbishop's distinctive vestment\r\nconsisted of the _pallium_, a narrow band of white wool, worn around the\r\nneck. The pope alone could confer the right to wear the _pallium_.\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL\r\n\r\nThe church which contained the official seat or throne [19] of a bishop or\r\narchbishop was called a cathedral. It was ordinarily the largest and most\r\nmagnificent church in the diocese. [20]\r\n\r\n\r\n163. THE REGULAR CLERGY\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF MONASTICISM\r\n\r\nThe regular clergy, or monks, during the early Middle Ages belonged to the\r\nBenedictine order. By the tenth century, however, St. Benedict's Rule had\r\nlost much of its force. As the monasteries increased in wealth through\r\ngifts of land and goods, they sometimes became centers of idleness,\r\nluxury, and corruption. The monks forgot their vows of poverty; and,\r\ninstead of themselves laboring as farmers, craftsmen, and students, they\r\nemployed laymen to work for them. At the same time powerful feudal lords\r\nfrequently obtained control of the monastic estates by appointing as\r\nabbots their children or their retainers. Grave danger existed that the\r\nmonasteries would pass out of Church control and decline into mere fiefs\r\nruled by worldly men.\r\n\r\nTHE CLUNIAC REVIVAL\r\n\r\nA great revival of monasticism began in 910 A.D., with the foundation of\r\nthe monastery of Cluny in eastern France. The monks of Cluny led lives of\r\nthe utmost self-denial and followed the Benedictine Rule in all its\r\nstrictness. Their enthusiasm and devotion were contagious; before long\r\nCluny became a center from which a reformatory movement spread over France\r\nand then over all western Europe. By the middle of the twelfth century\r\nmore than three hundred monasteries looked to Cluny for inspiration and\r\nguidance.\r\n\r\nTHE \"CONGREGATION OF CLUNY\"\r\n\r\nEach of the earlier Benedictine monasteries had been an isolated\r\ncommunity, independent and self-governing. Consequently, when discipline\r\ngrew lax or when the abbot proved to be an incapable ruler, it was\r\ndifficult to correct the evils which arose. In the Cluniac system,\r\nhowever, all the monasteries formed parts of one organization, the\r\n\"Congregation of Cluny.\" The abbot of Cluny appointed their \"priors,\" or\r\nheads, and required every monk to pass several years of his monastic life\r\nat Cluny itself. This monarchical arrangement helps to explain why for two\r\nhundred years the abbot of Cluny was, next to the pope, the most important\r\nchurchman in western Europe.\r\n\r\nTHE CISTERCIAN ORDER\r\n\r\nOther monastic orders arose in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Of\r\nthese, the most important was the Cistercian, founded in 1098 A.D. at\r\nCiteaux, not far from Cluny. The keynote of Cistercian life was the return\r\nto a literal obedience of St. Benedict's Rule. Hence the members of the\r\norder lived in the utmost simplicity, cooking their own meager repasts and\r\nwearing coarse woolen garments woven from the fleeces of their own sheep.\r\nThe Cistercians especially emphasized the need for manual labor. They were\r\nthe best farmers and cattle breeders of the Middle Ages. Western Europe\r\nowes even more to them than to the Benedictines for their work as pioneers\r\nin the wilderness. \"The Cistercians,\" declared a medieval writer, \"are a\r\nmodel to all monks, a mirror for the diligent, a spur to the indolent.\"\r\n\r\nST. BERNARD, 1090-1153 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe whole spirit of medieval monasticism found expression in St. Bernard,\r\na Burgundian of noble birth. While still a young man he resolved to leave\r\nthe world and seek the repose of the monastic life. He entered Citeaux,\r\ncarrying with him thirty companions. Mothers are said to have hid their\r\nsons from him, and wives their husbands, lest they should be converted to\r\nmonasticism by his persuasive words. After a few years at Citeaux St.\r\nBernard established the monastery of Clairvaux, over which he ruled as\r\nabbot till his death. His ascetic life, piety, eloquence, and ability as\r\nan executive soon brought him into prominence. People visited Clairvaux\r\nfrom far and near to listen to his preaching and to receive his counsels.\r\nThe monastery flourished under his direction and became the parent of no\r\nless than sixty-five Cistercian houses which were planted in the\r\nwilderness. St. Bernard's activities widened, till he came to be the most\r\ninfluential man in western Christendom. It was St. Bernard who acted as an\r\nadviser of the popes, at one time deciding between two rival candidates\r\nfor the Papacy, who combated most vigorously the heresies of the day, and\r\nwho by his fiery appeals set in motion one of the crusades. [21] The charm\r\nof his character is revealed to us in his sermons and letters, while some\r\nof the Latin hymns commonly attributed to him are still sung in many\r\nchurches, both Roman Catholic and Protestant.\r\n\r\n\r\n164. THE FRIARS\r\n\r\nCOMING OF THE FRIARS\r\n\r\nThe history of Christian monasticism exhibits an ever-widening social\r\noutlook. The early hermits [22] had devoted themselves, as they believed,\r\nto the service of God by retiring desert for prayer, meditation, and\r\nbodily mortification. St. Benedict's wise Rule, as followed by the\r\nmedieval monastic orders, marked a change for the better. It did away with\r\nextreme forms of self-denial, brought the monks together in a common\r\nhouse, and required them to engage in daily manual labor. Yet even the\r\nBenedictine system had its limitations. The monks lived apart from the\r\nworld and sought chiefly the salvation of their own souls. A new\r\nconception of the monastic life arose early in the thirteenth century,\r\nwith the coming of the friars. [23] The aim of the friars was social\r\nservice. They lived active lives in the world and devoted themselves\r\nentirely to the salvation of others. The foundation of the orders of\r\nfriars was the work of two men, St. Francis in Italy and St. Dominic in\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nST. FRANCIS, 1181(?)-1226 A.D.\r\n\r\nTwenty-eight years after the death of St. Bernard, St. Francis was born at\r\nAssisi. As the son of a rich and prominent merchant St. Francis had before\r\nhim the prospect of a fine career in the world. But he put away all\r\nthoughts of fame and wealth, deserted his gay companions, and, choosing\r\n\"Lady Poverty\" as his bride, started out to minister to lepers and social\r\noutcasts. One day, while attending Mass, the call came to him to preach\r\nthe Gospel, as Christ had preached it, among the poor and lowly. The man's\r\nearnestness and charm of manner soon drew about him devoted followers.\r\nAfter some years St. Francis went to Rome and obtained Pope Innocent III's\r\nsanction of his work. The Franciscan order spread so rapidly that even in\r\nthe founder's lifetime there were several thousand members in Italy and\r\nother European countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. FRANCIS BLESSING THE BIRDS\r\nFrom a painting by the Italian artist Giotto.]\r\n\r\nST. FRANCIS, THE MAN\r\n\r\nSt. Francis is one of the most attractive figures in all history. Perhaps\r\nno other man has ever tried so seriously to imitate in his own life the\r\nlife of Christ. St. Francis went about doing good. He resembled, in some\r\nrespects, the social workers and revivalist preachers of to-day. In other\r\nrespects he was a true child of the Middle Ages. An ascetic, he fasted,\r\nwore a hair-cloth shirt, mixed ashes with his food to make it\r\ndisagreeable, wept daily, so that his eyesight was nearly destroyed, and\r\nevery night flogged himself with iron chains. A mystic, he lived so close\r\nto God and nature that he could include within the bonds of his love not\r\nonly men and women, but also animals, trees, and flowers. He preached a\r\nsermon to the birds and once wrote a hymn to praise God for his\r\n\"brothers,\" sun, wind, and fire, and for his \"sisters,\" moon, water, and\r\nearth. When told that he had but a short time to live, he exclaimed,\r\n\"Welcome, Sister Death!\" He died at the age of forty-five, worn out by his\r\nexertions and self-denial. Two years later the pope made him a saint.\r\n\r\nST. DOMINIC, 1170-1221 A.D.\r\n\r\nSt. Dominic, unlike St. Francis, was a clergyman and a student of\r\ntheology. After being ordained he went to southern France and labored\r\nthere for ten years among a heretical sect known as the Albigenses. The\r\norder of Dominicans grew out of the little band of volunteers who assisted\r\nhim in the mission. St. Dominic sent his followers--at first only sixteen\r\nin number--out into the world to combat heresy. They met with great\r\nsuccess, and at the founder's death the Dominicans had as many as sixty\r\nfriaries in various European cities.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF THE FRIARS\r\n\r\nThe Franciscans and Dominicans resembled each other in many ways. They\r\nwere \"itinerant,\" going on foot from place to place, and wearing coarse\r\nrobes tied round the waist with a rope. They were \"mendicants,\" [24] who\r\npossessed no property but lived on the alms of the charitable. They were\r\nalso preachers, who spoke to the people, not in Latin, but in the common\r\nlanguage of each country which they visited. The Franciscans worked\r\nespecially in the \"slums\" of the cities; the Dominicans addressed\r\nthemselves rather to educated people and the upper classes. As time went\r\non, both orders relaxed the rule of poverty and became very wealthy. They\r\nstill survive, scattered all over the world and employed in teaching and\r\nmissionary activity. [25]\r\n\r\nTHE FRIARS AND THE PAPACY\r\n\r\nThe friars by their preaching and ministrations did a great deal to call\r\nforth a religious revival in Europe during the thirteenth century. In\r\nparticular they helped to strengthen the papal authority. Both orders\r\nreceived the sanction of the pope; both enjoyed many privileges at his\r\nhands; and both looked to him for direction. The pope employed them to\r\nraise money, to preach crusades, and to impose excommunications and\r\ninterdicts. The Franciscans and Dominicans formed, in fact, the agents of\r\nthe Papacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n165. POWER OF THE PAPACY\r\n\r\nTHE POPE'S EXALTED POSITION\r\n\r\nThe name \"pope\" [26] seems at first to have been applied to all priests as\r\na title of respect and affection. The Greek Church still continues this\r\nuse of the word. In the West it gradually came to be reserved to the\r\nbishop of Rome as his official title. The pope was addressed in speaking\r\nas \"Your Holiness.\" His exalted position was further indicated by the\r\ntiara, or headdress with triple crowns, worn by him in processions. [27]\r\nHe went to solemn ceremonies sitting in a chair supported on the shoulders\r\nof his guard. He gave audience from an elevated throne, and all who\r\napproached him kissed his feet in reverence. As \"Christ's Vicar\" he\r\nclaimed to be the representative on earth of the Almighty.\r\n\r\nTHE POPE AS THE HEAD OF WESTERN CHRISTENDOM\r\n\r\nThe pope was the supreme lawgiver of the Church. His decrees might not be\r\nset aside by any other person. He made new laws in the form of \"bulls\"\r\n[28] and by his \"dispensations\" could in particular cases set aside old\r\nlaws, such as those forbidding cousins to marry or monks to obtain release\r\nfrom their vows. The pope was also the supreme judge of the Church, for\r\nall appeals from the lower ecclesiastical courts came before him for\r\ndecision. Finally, the pope was the supreme administrator of the Church.\r\nHe confirmed the election of bishops, deposed them, when necessary, or\r\ntransferred them from one diocese to another. No archbishop might perform\r\nthe functions of his office until he had received the _pallium_ from the\r\npope's hands. The pope also exercised control over the monastic orders and\r\ncalled general councils of the Church.\r\n\r\nTHE PAPAL LEGATES\r\n\r\nThe authority of the pope was commonly exercised by the \"legates,\" [29]\r\nwhom he sent out as his representatives at the various European courts.\r\nThese officers kept the pope in close touch with the condition of the\r\nChurch in every part of western Europe. A similar function is performed in\r\nmodern times by the papal ambassadors known as \"nuncios.\"\r\n\r\nTHE CARDINALS\r\n\r\nFor assistance in government the pope made use of the cardinals, [30] who\r\nformed a board, or \"college.\" At first they were chosen only from the\r\nclergy of Rome and the vicinity, but in course of time the pope opened the\r\ncardinalate to prominent churchmen in all countries. The number of\r\ncardinals is now fixed at seventy, but the college is never full, and\r\nthere are always ten or more \"vacant hats,\" as the saying goes. The\r\ncardinals, in the eleventh century, received the right of choosing a new\r\npope. A cardinal ranks above all other church officers. His dignity is\r\nindicated by the red hat and scarlet robe which he wears and by the title\r\nof \"Eminence\" applied to him.\r\n\r\nINCOME OF THE PAPACY\r\n\r\nTo support the business of the Papacy and to maintain the splendor of the\r\npapal court required a large annual income. This came partly from the\r\nStates of the Church in Italy, partly from the gifts of the faithful, and\r\npartly from the payments made by abbots, bishops, and archbishops when the\r\npope confirmed their election to office. Still another source of revenue\r\nconsisted of \"Peter's Pence,\" a tax of a penny on each hearth. It was\r\ncollected every year in England and in some Continental countries until\r\nthe Reformation. The modern \"Peter's Pence\" is a voluntary contribution\r\nmade by Roman Catholics in all countries.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPITAL OF THE PAPACY\r\n\r\nThe Eternal City, from which in ancient times the known world had been\r\nruled, formed in the Middle Ages the capital of the Papacy. Hither every\r\nyear came tens of thousands of pilgrims to worship at the shrine of the\r\nPrince of the Apostles. Few traces now remain of the medieval city. Old\r\nSt. Peter's Church, where Charlemagne was crowned emperor, [31] gave way\r\nin the sixteenth century to the world-famous structure that now occupies\r\nits site. [32] The Lateran Palace, which for more than a thousand years\r\nserved as the residence of the popes, has also disappeared, its place\r\nbeing taken by a new and smaller building. The popes now live in the\r\nsplendid palace of the Vatican, adjoining St. Peter's.\r\n\r\nTHE PAPACY AND THE EMPIRE\r\n\r\nThe powers exercised by the popes during the later Middle Ages were not\r\nsecured without a struggle. As a matter of fact the concentration of\r\nauthority in papal hands was a gradual development covering several\r\nhundred years. The pope reached his exalted position only after a long\r\ncontest with the Holy Roman Emperor. This contest forms one of the most\r\nnoteworthy episodes in medieval history.\r\n\r\n\r\n166. POPES AND EMPERORS, 962-1122 A.D.\r\n\r\nRELATIONS BETWEEN POPE AND EMPEROR IN THEORY\r\n\r\nOne might suppose that there could be no interference between pope and\r\nemperor, since they seemed to have separate spheres of action. It was said\r\nthat God had made the pope, as the successor of St. Peter, supreme in\r\nspiritual matters and the emperor, as heir of the Roman Caesars, supreme\r\nin temporal matters. The former ruled men's souls, the latter, men's\r\nbodies. The two sovereigns thus divided on equal terms the government of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nTHEIR RELATIONS IN PRACTICE\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with this theory was that it did not work. No one could\r\ndecide in advance where the authority the pope ended and where that of the\r\nemperor began. When the pope claimed certain powers which were also\r\nclaimed by the emperor, a conflict between the two rulers became\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL POWER\r\nA tenth-century mosaic in the church of St. John, Rome. It represents\r\nChrist giving to St. Peter the keys of heaven, and to Constantine the\r\nbanner symbolic of earthly dominion.]\r\n\r\nOTTO THE GREAT AND THE PAPACY\r\n\r\nIn 962 A.D. Otto the Great, as we have learned, [33] restored imperial\r\nrule in the West, thus founding what in later centuries the came to be\r\nknown as the Holy Roman Empire. Otto as emperor possessed the rights of\r\nmaking the city of Rome the imperial capital, of approving the election of\r\nthe pope, and, in general, of exerting much influence in papal affairs.\r\nAll these rights had been exercised by Charlemagne. But Otto did what\r\nCharlemagne had never done when he deposed a pope who proved disobedient\r\nto his wishes and on his own authority appointed a successor. At the same\r\ntime Otto exacted from the people of Rome an oath that they would never\r\nrecognize any pope to whose election the emperor had not consented.\r\n\r\nTHE PAPACY AND OTTO'S SUCCESSORS\r\n\r\nThe emperors who followed Otto repeatedly interfered in elections to the\r\nPapacy. One strong ruler, Henry III (1039-1056 A.D.), has been called the\r\n\"pope-maker.\" Early in his reign he set aside three rival claimants to the\r\nPapacy, creating a German bishop pope, and on three subsequent occasions\r\nfilled the papal throne by fresh appointments. It was clear that if this\r\nsituation continued much longer the Papacy would become simply an imperial\r\noffice; it would be merged in the Empire.\r\n\r\nPAPAL ELECTION BY THE CARDINALS\r\n\r\nThe death of Henry III, which left the Empire in weak hands, gave the\r\nPapacy a chance to escape the control of the secular power. In 1059 A.D. a\r\nchurch council held at the Lateran Palace decreed that henceforth the\r\nright of choosing the supreme pontiff should belong exclusively to the\r\ncardinals, who represented the clergy of Rome. This arrangement has tended\r\nto prevent any interference with the election of popes, either by the\r\nRoman people or by foreign sovereigns.\r\n\r\nFEUDALIZING OF THE CHURCH\r\n\r\nNow that the Papacy had become independent, it began to deal with a grave\r\nproblem which affected the Church at large. According to ecclesiastical\r\nrule bishops ought to be chosen by the clergy of their diocese and abbots\r\nof by their monks. With the growth of feudalism, however, many of these\r\nhigh dignitaries had become vassals, holding their lands as fiefs of\r\nprinces, kings, and emperors, and owing the usual feudal dues. Their lords\r\nexpected them to perform the ceremony of homage, [34] before \"investing\"\r\nthem with the lands attached to the bishopric or monastery. One can\r\nreadily see that in practice the lords really chose the bishops and\r\nabbots, since they could always refuse to \"invest\" those who were\r\ndispleasing to them.\r\n\r\nLAY INVESTITURE FROM THE CHURCH STANDPOINT\r\n\r\nTo the reformers in the Church lay investiture appeared intolerable. How\r\ncould the Church keep itself unspotted from the world when its highest\r\nofficers were chosen by laymen and were compelled to perform unpriestly\r\nduties? In the act of investiture the reformers also saw the sin of simony\r\n[35]--the sale of sacred powers--because there was such a temptation\r\nbefore the candidate for a bishopric or abbacy to buy the position with\r\npromises or with money.\r\n\r\nLAY INVESTITURE AS VIEWED BY THE SECULAR AUTHORITY\r\n\r\nThe lords, on the other hand, believed that as long as bishops and abbots\r\nheld vast estates on feudal tenure they should continue to perform the\r\nobligations of vassalage. To forbid lay investiture was to deprive the\r\nlords of all control over Church dignitaries. The real difficulty of the\r\nsituation existed, of course, in the fact that the bishops and abbots were\r\nboth spiritual officers and temporal rulers, were servants of both the\r\nChurch and the State. They found it very difficult to serve two masters.\r\n\r\nPONTIFICATE OF GREGORY VII, 1073-1085 A.D.\r\n\r\nIn 1073 A.D. there came to the throne of St. Peter one of the most\r\nremarkable of the popes. This was Hildebrand, who, on becoming pope, took\r\nthe name of Gregory VII. Of obscure Italian birth, he received his\r\neducation in a Benedictine monastery at Rome and rose rapidly to a\r\nposition of great influence in papal affairs. He is described as a small\r\nman, ungainly in appearance and with a weak voice, but energetic,\r\nforceful, and of imperious will.\r\n\r\nGREGORY'S AIMS\r\n\r\nGregory devoted all his talents to the advancement of the Papacy. A\r\ncontemporary document, [36] which may have been of Gregory's own\r\ncomposition and at any rate expresses his ideas, contains the following\r\nstatements: \"The Roman pontiff alone is properly called universal. He\r\nalone may depose bishops and restore them to office. He is the only person\r\nwhose feet are kissed by all princes. He may depose emperors. He may be\r\njudged by no one. He may absolve from their allegiance the subjects of the\r\nwicked. The Roman Church never has erred, and never can err, as the\r\nScriptures testify.\" Gregory did not originate these doctrines, but he was\r\nthe first pope who ventured to make a practical application of them.\r\n\r\nDECREE AGAINST LAY INVESTITURE, 1075 A.D.\r\n\r\nTwo years after Gregory became pope he issued a decree against lay\r\ninvestiture. It declared that no emperor, king, duke, marquis, count, or\r\nany other lay person should presume to grant investiture, under pain of\r\nexcommunication. This decree was a general one, applying to all states of\r\nwestern Europe, but circumstances were such that it mainly affected\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nHENRY IV AND GREGORY VII\r\n\r\nHenry IV, the ruler of Germany at this time, did not refuse the papal\r\nchallenge. He wrote a famous letter to Gregory, calling him \"no pope but\r\nfalse monk,\" telling him Christ had never called him to the priesthood,\r\nand bidding him \"come down;\" \"come down\" from St. Peter's throne. Gregory,\r\nin reply, deposed Henry as emperor, excommunicated him, and freed his\r\nsubjects from their allegiance.\r\n\r\nCANOSSA, 1077 A.D.\r\n\r\nThis severe sentence made a profound impression in Germany. Henry's\r\nadherents fell away, and it seemed probable that the German nobles would\r\nelect another ruler in his stead. Henry then decided on abject submission.\r\nHe hastened across the Alps and found the pope at the castle of Canossa,\r\non the northern slopes of the Apennines. It was January, and the snow lay\r\ndeep on the ground. For three days the emperor stood shivering outside the\r\ncastle gate, barefoot and clad in a coarse woolen shirt, the garb of a\r\npenitent. At last, upon the entreaties of the Countess Matilda of Tuscany,\r\nGregory admitted Henry and granted absolution. It was a strange and moving\r\nspectacle, one which well expressed the tremendous power which the Church\r\nin the Middle Ages exercised over the minds of men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY IV, COUNTESS MATILDA, AND GREGORY VII\r\nFrom a manuscript of the twelfth century now in the Vatican Library at\r\nRome.]\r\n\r\nCONCORDAT OF WORMS, 1122 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic scene at Canossa did not end the investiture conflict. It\r\ndragged on for half a century, being continued after Gregory's death by\r\nthe popes who succeeded him. At last in 1122 A.D. the opposing parties\r\nagreed to what is known as the Concordat of Worms, from the old German\r\ncity where it was signed.\r\n\r\nTERMS OF THE CONCORDAT\r\n\r\nThe concordat drew a distinction between spiritual and lay investiture.\r\nThe emperor renounced investiture by the ring and crosier--the emblems of\r\nspiritual authority--and permitted bishops and abbots to be elected by the\r\nclergy and confirmed in office by the pope. On the other hand the pope\r\nrecognized the emperor's right to be present at all elections and to\r\ninvest bishops and abbots by the scepter for whatever lands they held\r\nwithin his domains. This reasonable compromise worked well for a time. But\r\nit was a truce, not a peace. It did not settle the more fundamental issue,\r\nwhether the Papacy or the Holy Roman Empire should be supreme.\r\n\r\n\r\n167. POPES AND EMPERORS, 1122-1273 A.D.\r\n\r\nFREDERICK I, EMPEROR, 1152-1190\r\n\r\nThirty years after the signing of the Concordat of Worms the emperor\r\nFrederick I, called Barbarossa from his red beard, succeeded to the\r\nthrone. Frederick, the second emperor, of the Hohenstaufen dynasty [37]\r\nwas capable, imaginative, and ambitious. He took Charlemagne and Otto the\r\nGreat as his models and aspired like them to rule Christian Europe and the\r\nChurch. His reign is the story of many attempts, ending at length in\r\nfailure, to unite all Italy into a single state under German sway.\r\n\r\nFREDERICK AND THE PAPACY\r\n\r\nFrederick's Italian policy brought him at once into conflict with two\r\npowerful enemies. The popes, who feared that his success would imperil the\r\nindependence of the Papacy, opposed him at every step. The great cities of\r\nnorthern Italy, which were also threatened by Frederick's soaring schemes,\r\nunited in the Lombard League to defend their freedom. The popes gave the\r\nleague their support, and in 1176 A.D. Frederick was badly beaten at the\r\nbattle of Legnano. The haughty emperor confessed himself conquered, and\r\nsought reconciliation with the pope, Alexander III. In the presence of a\r\nvast throng assembled before St. Mark's Cathedral in Venice, Frederick\r\nknelt before the pope and humbly kissed his feet. Just a century had\r\npassed since the humiliation of Henry IV at Canossa.\r\n\r\nPONTIFICATE OF INNOCENT III, 1198-1216 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Papacy reached the height of its power under Innocent III. The\r\neighteen years of his pontificate were one long effort, for the most part\r\nsuccessful, to make the pope the arbiter of Europe. Innocent announced the\r\nclaims of the Papacy in the most uncompromising manner. \"As the moon,\" he\r\ndeclared, \"receives its light from the sun, and is inferior to the sun, so\r\ndo kings receive all their glory and dignity from the Holy See.\" This\r\nmeant, according to Innocent, that the pope has the right to interfere in\r\nall secular matters and in the quarrels of rulers. \"God,\" he continued,\r\n\"has set the Prince of the Apostles over kings and kingdoms, with a\r\nmission to tear up, plant, destroy, scatter, and rebuild.\"\r\n\r\nINNOCENT AND KING PHILIP OF FRANCE\r\n\r\nThat Innocent's claims were not idle boasts is shown by what he\r\naccomplished. When Philip Augustus, king of France, divorced his wife and\r\nmade another marriage, Innocent declared the divorce void and ordered him\r\nto take back his discarded queen. Philip refused, and Innocent, through\r\nhis legate, put France under an interdict. From that hour all religious\r\nrites ceased. The church doors were barred; the church bells were silent,\r\nthe sick died unshriven, the dead lay unburied. Philip, deserted by his\r\nretainers, was compelled to submit.\r\n\r\nINNOCENT AND KING JOHN OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\nOn another occasion Innocent ordered John, the English king, to accept as\r\narchbishop of Canterbury a man of his own choosing. When John declared\r\nthat he would never allow the pope's appointee to set foot on English\r\nsoil, Innocent replied by excommunicating him and laying his kingdom under\r\nan interdict. John also had to yield and went so far as to surrender\r\nEngland and Ireland to the pope, receiving them back again as fiefs, for\r\nwhich he promised to pay a yearly rent. This tribute money was actually\r\npaid, though irregularly, for about a century and a half.\r\n\r\nFREDERICK II, EMPEROR, 1212-1250 A.D.\r\n\r\nInnocent further exhibited his power by elevating to the imperial throne\r\nFrederick II, grandson of Frederick Barbarossa. The young man, after\r\nInnocent's death, proved to be a most determined opponent of the Papacy.\r\nHe passed much of his long reign in Italy, warring vainly against the\r\npopes and the Lombard cities. Frederick died in 1250 A.D., and with him\r\nthe Holy Roman Empire really ceased to exist. [38] None of the succeeding\r\nholders of the imperial title exercised any authority outside of Germany.\r\n\r\nINTERREGNUM, 1254-1273 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe death of Frederick II's son in 1254 A.D. ended the Hohenstaufen\r\ndynasty. There now ensued what is called the Interregnum, a period of\r\nnineteen years, during which Germany was without a ruler. At length the\r\npope sent word to the German electors that if they did not choose an\r\nemperor, he would himself do so. The electors then chose Rudolf of\r\nHapsburg [39] (1273 A.D.). Rudolf gained papal support by resigning all\r\nclaims on Italy, but recompensed himself through the conquest of Austria.\r\n[40] Ever since this time the Hapsburg dynasty has filled the Austrian\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nOUTCOME OF THE CONFLICT\r\n\r\nThe conflict between popes and emperors was now ended. Its results were\r\nmomentous. Germany, so long neglected by its rightful rulers, who pursued\r\nthe will-o'-the-wisp in Italy, broke up into a mass of duchies, counties,\r\narchbishoprics, and free cities. The map of the country at this time shows\r\nhow numerous were these small feudal states. They did not combine into a\r\nstrong government till the nineteenth century. [41] Italy likewise\r\nremained disunited and lacked even a common monarch. The real victor was\r\nthe Papacy, which had crushed the Empire and had prevented the union of\r\nItaly and Germany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, GERMANY AND ITALY During the Interregnum 1254-1273\r\nA.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\n168. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH AND WARFARE\r\n\r\nMedieval society, we have now learned, owed much to the Church, both as a\r\nteacher of religion and morals and as an agency of government. It remains\r\nto ask what was the attitude of the Church toward the great social\r\nproblems of the Middle Ages. In regard to warfare, the prevalence of which\r\nformed one of the worst evils of the time, the Church, in general, cast\r\nits influence on the side of peace. It deserves credit for establishing\r\nthe Peace and the Truce of God and for many efforts to heal strife between\r\nprinces and nobles. Yet, as will be shown, the Church did not carry the\r\nadvocacy of peace so far as to condemn warfare against heretics and\r\ninfidels. Christians believed that it was a religious duty to exterminate\r\nthese enemies of God.\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH AND CHARITY\r\n\r\nThe Church was distinguished for charitable work. The clergy received\r\nlarge sums for distribution to the needy. From the doors of the\r\nmonasteries, the poor, the sick, and the infirm of every sort were never\r\nturned away. Medieval charity, however, was very often injudicious. The\r\nproblem of removing the causes of poverty seems never to have been raised;\r\nand the indiscriminate giving multiplied, rather than reduced, the number\r\nof beggars.\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH AND SLAVERY AND SERFDOM\r\n\r\nNeither slavery nor serfdom, into which slavery gradually passed, [42] was\r\never pronounced unlawful by pope or Church council. The Church condemned\r\nslavery only when it was the servitude of a Christian in bondage to a Jew\r\nor an infidel. Abbots, bishops, and popes possessed slaves and serfs. The\r\nserfs of some wealthy monasteries were counted by thousands. The Church,\r\nhowever, encouraged the freeing of bondmen as a meritorious act and always\r\npreached the duty of kindness and forbearance toward them.\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY OF THE CHURCH\r\n\r\nThe Church also helped to promote the cause of human freedom by insisting\r\non the natural equality of all men in the sight of God. \"The Creator,\"\r\nwrote one of the popes, \"distributes his gifts without regard to social\r\nclasses. In his eyes there are neither nobles nor serfs.\" It was not\r\nnecessary to be of noble birth to become a bishop, a cardinal, or a pope.\r\nEven serfs succeeded to the chair of St. Peter. Naturally enough, the\r\nChurch attracted the keenest minds of the age, a fact which largely\r\nexplains the influence exerted by the clergy.\r\n\r\nTHE CLERGY AS THE ONLY EDUCATED CLASS\r\n\r\nThe influence of the clergy in medieval Europe was also due to the fact\r\nthat they were almost the only persons of education. Few except churchmen\r\nwere able to read or write. So generally was this the case that an\r\noffender could prove himself a clergyman, thus securing \"benefit of\r\nclergy,\" [43] if he showed his ability to read a single line. It is\r\ninteresting, also, to note that the word \"clerk,\" which comes from the\r\nLatin _clericus_, was originally limited to churchmen, since they alone\r\ncould keep accounts, write letters, and perform other secretarial duties.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF THE CLERGY\r\n\r\nIt is clear that priests and monks had much importance quite aside from\r\ntheir religious duties. They controlled the schools, wrote the books,\r\nframed the laws, and, in general, acted as leaders and molders of public\r\nopinion. A most conspicuous instance of the authority wielded by them is\r\nseen in the crusades. These holy wars of Christendom against Islam must\r\nnow be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n169. CAUSES OF THE CRUSADES\r\n\r\nPLACE OF THE CRUSADES IN HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe series of military expeditions, undertaken by the Christians of Europe\r\nfor the purpose of recovering the Holy Land from the Moslems, have\r\nreceived the name of crusades. In their widest aspect the crusades may be\r\nregarded as a renewal of the age-long contest between East and West, in\r\nwhich the struggle of Greeks and Persians and of Romans and Carthaginians\r\nformed the earlier episodes. The contest assumed a new character when\r\nEurope had become Christian and Asia Mohammedan. It was not only two\r\ncontrasting types of civilization but also two rival world religions which\r\nin the eighth century faced each other under the walls of Constantinople\r\nand on the battlefield of Tours. Now, during the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies, they were to meet again.\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF THE CRUSADES\r\n\r\nSeven or eight chief crusades are usually enumerated. To number them,\r\nhowever, obscures the fact that for nearly two hundred years Europe and\r\nAsia were engaged in almost constant warfare. Throughout this period there\r\nwas a continuous movement of crusaders to and from the Moslem possessions\r\nin Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt.\r\n\r\nPILGRIMAGES TO THE HOLY LAND\r\n\r\nThe crusades were first and foremost a spiritual enterprise. They sprang\r\nfrom the pilgrimages which Christians had long been accustomed to make to\r\nthe scenes of Christ's life on earth. Men considered it a wonderful\r\nprivilege to see the cave in which He was born, to kiss the spot where He\r\ndied, and to kneel in prayer at His tomb. The eleventh century saw an\r\nincreased zeal for pilgrimages, and from this time travelers to the Holy\r\nLand were very numerous. For greater security they often joined themselves\r\nin companies and marched under arms. It needed little to transform such\r\npilgrims into crusaders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMBAT BETWEEN CRUSADERS AND MOSLEMS\r\nA picture in an eleventh-century window, formerly in the church of St.\r\nDenis, near Paris.]\r\n\r\nABUSE OF PILGRIMS BY THE TURKS\r\n\r\nThe Arab conquest of the Holy Land had not interrupted the stream of\r\npilgrims, for the early caliphs were more tolerant of unbelievers than\r\nChristian emperors of heretics. But after the coming of the Seljuk Turks\r\ninto the East, pilgrimages became more difficult and dangerous. The Turks\r\nwere a ruder people than the Arabs whom they displaced, and in their\r\nfanatic zeal for Islam were not inclined to treat the Christians with\r\nconsideration. Many tales floated back to Europe of the outrages committed\r\non the pilgrims and on the sacred shrines venerated by all Christendom.\r\nSuch stories, which lost nothing in the telling, aroused a storm of\r\nindignation throughout Europe and awakened the desire to rescue the Holy\r\nLand from the grasp of the \"infidel.\"\r\n\r\nTHE CRUSADES AND THE UPPER CLASSES\r\n\r\nBut the crusades were not simply an expression of the simple faith of the\r\nMiddle Ages. Something more than religious enthusiasm sent an unending\r\nprocession of crusaders along the highways of Europe and over the\r\ntrackless wastes of Asia Minor to Jerusalem. The crusades, in fact,\r\nappealed strongly to the warlike instincts of the feudal nobles. They saw\r\nin an expedition against the East an unequaled opportunity for acquiring\r\nfame, riches, lands, and power. The Normans were especially stirred by the\r\nprospect of adventure and plunder which the crusading movement opened up.\r\nBy the end of the eleventh century they had established themselves in\r\nsouthern Italy and Sicily, from which they now looked across the\r\nMediterranean for further lands to conquer. [2] Norman knights formed a\r\nvery large element in several of the crusaders' armies.\r\n\r\nTHE LOWER CLASSES AND THE CRUSADES\r\n\r\nThe crusades also attracted the lower classes. So great was the misery of\r\nthe common people in medieval Europe that for them it seemed not a\r\nhardship, but rather a relief, to leave their homes in order to better\r\nthemselves abroad. Famine and pestilence, poverty and oppression, drove\r\nthem to emigrate hopefully to the golden East.\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGES OF CRUSADERS\r\n\r\nThe Church, in order to foster the crusades, promised both religious and\r\nsecular benefits to those who took part in them. A warrior of the Cross\r\nwas to enjoy forgiveness of all his past sins. If he died fighting for the\r\nfaith, he was assured of an immediate entrance to the joys of Paradise.\r\nThe Church also freed him from paying interest on his debts and threatened\r\nwith excommunication anyone who molested his wife, his children, or his\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n\r\n170. FIRST CRUSADE, 1095-1099 A.D.\r\n\r\nOCCASION OF THE FIRST CRUSADE\r\n\r\nThe signal for the First Crusade was given by the conquests of the Seljuk\r\nTurks. [3] These barbarians, at first the mercenaries and then the masters\r\nof the Abbasid caliphs, infused fresh energy into Islam. They began a new\r\nera of Mohammedan expansion by winning almost the whole of Asia Minor from\r\nthe Roman Empire in the East. One of their leaders established himself at\r\nNicaea, the scene of the first Church Council, [4] and founded the\r\nsultanate of Rum (Rome).\r\n\r\nAPPEAL OF EMPEROR TO POPE\r\n\r\nThe presence of the Turks so close to Constantinople was a standing menace\r\nto all Europe. The able emperor, Alexius I, on succeeding to the throne\r\ntoward the close of the eleventh century, took steps to expel the\r\ninvaders. He could not draw on the hardy tribes of Asia Minor for the\r\nsoldiers he needed, but with reinforcements from the West he hoped to\r\nrecover the lost provinces of the empire. Accordingly, in 1095 A.D.,\r\nAlexius sent an embassy to Pope Urban II, the successor of Gregory VII,\r\nrequesting aid. The fact that the emperor appealed to the pope, rather\r\nthan to any king, shows what a high place the Papacy then held in the\r\naffairs of Europe.\r\n\r\nCOUNCIL OF CLERMONT, 1095 A.D.\r\n\r\nTo the appeal of Alexius, Urban lent a willing ear. He summoned a great\r\ncouncil of clergy and nobles to meet at Clermont in France. Here, in an\r\naddress which, measured by its results, was the most momentous recorded in\r\nhistory, Pope Urban preached the First Crusade. He said little about the\r\ndangers which threatened the Roman Empire in the East from the Turks, but\r\ndwelt chiefly on the wretched condition of the Holy Land, with its\r\nchurches polluted by unbelievers and its Christian inhabitants tortured\r\nand enslaved. Then, turning to the proud knights who stood by, Urban\r\ncalled upon them to abandon their wicked practice of private warfare and\r\ntake up arms, instead, against the infidel. \"Christ Himself,\" he cried,\r\n\"will be your leader, when, like the Israelites of old, you fight for\r\nJerusalem.... Start upon the way to the Holy Sepulcher; wrench the land\r\nfrom the accursed race, and subdue it yourselves. Thus shall you spoil\r\nyour foes of their wealth and return home victorious, or, purpled with\r\nyour own blood, receive an everlasting reward.\"\r\n\r\n\"GOD WILLS IT!\"\r\n\r\nUrban's trumpet call to action met an instant response. From the assembled\r\nhost there went up, as it were, a single shout: \"God wills it! God wills\r\nit!\" \"It is, in truth, His will,\" answered Urban, \"and let these words be\r\nyour war cry when you unsheath your swords against the enemy.\" Then man\r\nafter man pressed forward to receive the badge of a crusader, a cross of\r\nred cloth. [5] It was to be worn on the breast, when the crusader went\r\nforth, and on the back, when he returned.\r\n\r\nPRELUDE TO THE FIRST CRUSADE\r\n\r\nThe months which followed the Council of Clermont were marked by an\r\nepidemic of religious excitement in western Europe. Popular preachers\r\neverywhere took up the cry \"God wills it!\" and urged their hearers to\r\nstart for Jerusalem. A monk named Peter the Hermit aroused large parts of\r\nFrance with his passionate eloquence, as he rode from town to town,\r\ncarrying a huge cross before him and preaching to vast crowds. Without\r\nwaiting for the main body of nobles, which was to assemble at\r\nConstantinople in the summer of 1096 A.D., a horde of poor men, women, and\r\nchildren set out, unorganized and almost unarmed, on the road to the Holy\r\nLand. One of these crusading bands, led by Peter the Hermit, managed to\r\nreach Constantinople, after suffering terrible hardships. The emperor\r\nAlexius sent his ragged allies as quickly as possible to Asia Minor, where\r\nmost of them were slaughtered by the Turks.\r\n\r\nTHE MAIN CRUSADE\r\n\r\nMeanwhile real armies were gathering in the West. Recruits came in greater\r\nnumbers from France than from any other country, a circumstance which\r\nresulted in the crusaders being generally called \"Franks\" by their Moslem\r\nfoes. They had no single commander, but each contingent set out for\r\nConstantinople by its own route and at its own time. [6]\r\n\r\nLEADERS OF THE CRUSADE\r\n\r\nThe crusaders included among their leaders some of the most distinguished\r\nrepresentatives of European knighthood. Count Raymond of Toulouse headed a\r\nband of volunteers from Provence in southern France. Godfrey of Bouillon\r\nand his brother Baldwin commanded a force of French and Germans from the\r\nRhinelands. Normandy sent Robert, William the Conqueror's eldest son. The\r\nNormans from Italy and Sicily were led by Bohemond, a son of Robert\r\nGuiscard, [7] and his nephew Tancred.\r\n\r\nTHE CRUSADERS IN ASIA MINOR AND SYRIA\r\n\r\nThough the crusaders probably did not number more than fifty thousand\r\nfighting men, the disunion which prevailed among the Turks favored the\r\nsuccess of their enterprise. With some assistance from the eastern emperor\r\nthey captured Nicaea, overran Asia Minor, and at length reached Antioch,\r\nthe key to northern Syria. The city fell after a siege of seven months,\r\nbut the crusaders were scarcely within the walls before they found\r\nthemselves besieged by a large Turkish army. The crusaders were now in a\r\ndesperate plight: famine wasted their ranks; many soldiers deserted; and\r\nAlexius disappointed all hope of rescue. But the news of the discovery in\r\nan Antioch church of the Holy Lance which had pierced the Savior's side\r\nrestored their drooping spirits. The whole army issued forth from the\r\ncity, bearing the relic as a standard, and drove the Turks in headlong\r\nflight. This victory opened the road to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"MOSQUE OF OMAR,\" JERUSALEM\r\nMore correctly called the Dome of the Rock. It was erected in 691 A.D.,\r\nbut many restorations have taken place since that date. The walls\r\nenclosing the entire structure were built in the ninth century, and the\r\ndome is attributed to Saladin (1189 A.D.). This building, with its\r\nbrilliant tiles covering the walls and its beautiful stained glass, is a\r\nfine example of Mohammedan architecture.]\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF JERUSALEM, 1099 A.D.\r\n\r\nReduced now to perhaps one-fourth of their original numbers, the crusaders\r\nadvanced slowly to the city which formed the goal of all their efforts.\r\nBefore attacking it they marched barefoot in religious procession around\r\nthe walls, with Peter the Hermit at their head. Then came the grand\r\nassault. Godfrey of Bouillon and Tancred were among the first to mount the\r\nramparts. Once inside the city, the crusaders massacred their enemies\r\nwithout mercy. Afterwards, we are told, they went \"rejoicing, nay for\r\nexcess of joy weeping, to the tomb of our Savior to adore and give\r\nthanks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n171. CRUSADERS' STATES IN SYRIA\r\n\r\nLATIN KINGDOM OF JERUSALEM\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of Jerusalem the crusaders met to elect a king. Their\r\nchoice fell upon Godfrey of Bouillon. He refused to wear a crown of gold\r\nin the city where Christ had worn a crown of thorns and accepted, instead,\r\nthe modest title of \"Protector of the Holy Sepulcher.\" [8] Godfrey died\r\nthe next year and his brother Baldwin, who succeeded him, being less\r\nscrupulous, was crowned king at Bethlehem. The new kingdom contained\r\nnearly a score of fiefs, whose lords made war, administered justice, and\r\ncoined money, like independent rulers. The main features of European\r\nfeudalism were thus transplanted to Asiatic soil.\r\n\r\nOTHER CRUSADERS' STATES\r\n\r\nThe winning of Jerusalem and the district about it formed hardly more than\r\na preliminary stage in the conquest of Syria. Much fighting was still\r\nnecessary before the crusaders could establish themselves firmly in the\r\ncountry. Instead of founding one strong power in Syria, they split up\r\ntheir possessions into the three principalities of Tripoli, Antioch, and\r\nEdessa. These small states owed allegiance to the Latin Kingdom of\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\nMILITARY-RELIGIOUS ORDERS\r\n\r\nThe ability of the crusaders' states to maintain themselves for many years\r\nin Syria was largely due to the foundation of two military-religious\r\norders. The members were both monks and knights; that is, to the monastic\r\nvows of chastity, poverty, and obedience they added a fourth vow, which\r\nbound them to protect pilgrims and fight the infidels. Such a combination\r\nof religion and warfare made a strong appeal to the medieval mind.\r\n\r\nHOSPITALERS AND TEMPLARS\r\n\r\nThe Hospitalers, the first of these orders, grew out of a brotherhood for\r\nthe care of sick pilgrims in a hospital at Jerusalem. Many knights joined\r\nthe organization, which soon proved to be very useful in defending the\r\nHoly Land. Even more important were the Templars, so called because their\r\nheadquarters in Jerusalem lay near the site of Solomon's Temple. Both\r\norders built many castles in Syria, the remains of which still impress the\r\nbeholder. They established numerous branches in Europe and, by presents\r\nand legacies, acquired vast wealth. The Templars were disbanded in the\r\nfourteenth century, but the Hospitalers continued to fight valiantly\r\nagainst the Turks long after the close of the crusading movement. [9]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EFFIGY OF A KNIGHT TEMPLAR\r\nTemple Church, London. Shows the kind of armor worn between 1190 and 1225\r\nA.D.]\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN AND INFIDEL IN THE HOLY LAND\r\n\r\nThe depleted ranks of the crusaders were constantly filled by fresh bands\r\nof pilgrim knights who visited Palestine to pray at the Holy Sepulcher and\r\ncross swords with the infidel. In spite of constant border warfare much\r\ntrade and friendly intercourse prevailed between Christians and Moslems.\r\nThey learned to respect one another both as foes and neighbors. The\r\ncrusaders' states in Syria became, like Spain [10] and Sicily, [11] a\r\nmeeting-place of East and West.\r\n\r\n\r\n172. SECOND CRUSADE, 1147-1149 A.D., AND THIRD CRUSADE, 1189-1192 A.D.\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE SECOND CRUSADE\r\n\r\nThe success of the Christians in the First Crusade had been largely due to\r\nthe disunion among their enemies. But the Moslems learned in time the\r\nvalue of united action, and in 1144 A.D. succeeded in capturing Edessa,\r\none of the principal Christian outposts in the East. The fall of the city,\r\nfollowed by the loss of the entire county of Edessa, aroused western\r\nEurope to the danger which threatened the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem and\r\nled to another crusading enterprise.\r\n\r\nPREACHING OF ST. BERNARD\r\n\r\nThe apostle of the Second Crusade was the great abbot of Clairvaux, St.\r\nBernard. [12] Scenes of the wildest enthusiasm marked his preaching. When\r\nthe churches were not large enough to hold the crowds which flocked to\r\nhear him, he spoke from platforms erected in the fields. St. Bernard's\r\neloquence induced two monarchs, Louis VII of France and Conrad III of\r\nGermany, to take the blood-red cross of a crusader.\r\n\r\nFAILURE OF THE SECOND CRUSADE\r\n\r\nThe Second Crusade, though begun under the most favorable auspices, had an\r\nunhappy ending. Of the great host that set out from Europe, only a few\r\nthousands escaped annihilation in Asia Minor at the hands of the Turks.\r\nLouis and Conrad, with the remnants of their armies, made a joint attack\r\non Damascus, but had to raise the siege after a few days. This closed the\r\ncrusade. As a chronicler of the expedition remarked, \"having practically\r\naccomplished nothing, the inglorious ones returned home.\"\r\n\r\nSALADIN\r\n\r\nNot many years after the Second Crusade, the Moslem world found in the\r\nfamous Saladin a leader for a holy war against the Christians. Saladin in\r\ncharacter was a typical Mohammedan, very devout in prayers and fasting,\r\nfiercely hostile toward unbelievers, and full of the pride of race. To\r\nthese qualities he added a kindliness and humanity not surpassed, if\r\nequaled, by any of his Christian foes. He lives in eastern history and\r\nlegend as the hero who stemmed once for all the tide of European conquest\r\nin Asia.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF JERUSALEM BY SALADIN, 1187 A.D.\r\n\r\nHaving made himself sultan of Egypt, Saladin united the Moslems of Syria\r\nunder his sway and then advanced against the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem.\r\nThe Christians met him in a great battle near the lake of Galilee. It\r\nended in the rout of their army and the capture of their king. Even the\r\nHoly Cross, which they had carried in the midst of the fight, became the\r\nspoil of the conqueror. Saladin quickly reaped the fruits of victory. The\r\nChristian cities of Syria opened their gates to him, and at last Jerusalem\r\nitself surrendered after a short siege. Little now remained of the\r\npossessions which the crusaders had won in the East.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CRUSADE ORGANIZED, 1189 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe news of the taking of Jerusalem spread consternation throughout\r\nwestern Christendom. The cry for another crusade arose on all sides. Once\r\nmore thousands of men sewed the cross in gold, or silk, or cloth upon\r\ntheir garments and set out for the Holy Land. When the three greatest\r\nrulers of Europe--Philip Augustus, [13] king of France, Richard I, king of\r\nEngland, and the German emperor, Frederick Barbarossa [14]--assumed the\r\ncross, it seemed that nothing could prevent the restoration of Christian\r\nsupremacy in Syria.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF FREDERICK BARBAROSSA, 1190 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Germans under Frederick Barbarossa were the first to start. This great\r\nemperor was now nearly seventy years old, yet age had not lessened his\r\ncrusading zeal. He took the overland route and after much hard fighting\r\nreached southern Asia Minor. Here, however, he was drowned, while trying\r\nto cross a swollen stream. Many of his discouraged followers at once\r\nreturned to Germany; a few of them, however, pressed on and joined the\r\nother crusaders before the walls of Acre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RICHARD I IN PRISON\r\nFrom an illuminated manuscript of the thirteenth century. King Richard on\r\nhis return from the Holy Land was shipwrecked off the coast of the\r\nAdriatic. Attempting to travel through Austria in disguise, he was\r\ncaptured by the duke of Austria, whom he had offended at the siege of\r\nAcre. The king regained his liberty only by paying a ransom equivalent to\r\nmore than twice the annual revenues of England.]\r\n\r\nACRE CAPTURED BY PHILIP AND RICHARD, 1191 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe expedition of the French and English achieved little. Philip and\r\nRichard, who came by sea, captured Acre after a hard siege, but their\r\nquarrels prevented them from following up this initial success. Philip\r\nsoon went home, leaving the further conduct of the crusade in Richard's\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nRICHARD IN THE HOLY LAND, 1191-1192 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe English king remained for fourteen months longer in the Holy Land. His\r\ncampaigns during this time gained for him the title of \"Lion-hearted,\"\r\n[15] by which he is always known. He had many adventures and performed\r\nknightly exploits without number, but could not capture Jerusalem.\r\nTradition declares that when, during a truce, some crusaders went up to\r\nJerusalem, Richard refused to accompany them, saying that he would not\r\nenter as a pilgrim the city which he could not rescue as a conqueror. He\r\nand Saladin finally concluded a treaty by the terms of which Christians\r\nwere permitted to visit Jerusalem without paying tribute. Richard then set\r\nsail for England, and with his departure from the Holy Land the Third\r\nCrusade came to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n173. FOURTH CRUSADE AND THE LATIN EMPIRE OF CONSTANTINOPLE, 1202-1261 A.D.\r\n\r\nINNOCENT III AND THE FOURTH CRUSADE\r\n\r\nThe real author of the Fourth Crusade was the famous pope, Innocent III.\r\n[16] Young, enthusiastic, and ambitious for the glory of the Papacy, he\r\nrevived the plans of Urban II and sought once more to unite the forces of\r\nChristendom against Islam. No emperor or king answered his summons, but a\r\nnumber of knights (chiefly French) took the crusader's vow.\r\n\r\nTHE CRUSADERS AND THE VENETIANS\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the crusade decided to make Egypt their objective point,\r\nsince this country was then the center of the Moslem power. Accordingly,\r\nthe crusaders proceeded to Venice, for the purpose of securing\r\ntransportation across the Mediterranean. The Venetians agreed to furnish\r\nthe necessary ships only on condition that the crusaders first seized Zara\r\non the eastern coast of the Adriatic. Zara was a Christian city, but it\r\nwas also a naval and commercial rival of Venice. In spite of the pope's\r\nprotests the crusaders besieged and captured the city. Even then they did\r\nnot proceed against the Moslems. The Venetians persuaded them to turn\r\ntheir arms against Constantinople. The possession of that great capital\r\nwould greatly increase Venetian trade and influence in the East; for the\r\ncrusading nobles it held out endless opportunities of acquiring wealth and\r\npower. Thus it happened that these soldiers of the Cross, pledged to war\r\nwith the Moslems, attacked a Christian city, which for centuries had\r\nformed the chief bulwark of Europe against the Arab and the Turk.\r\n\r\nSACK OF CONSTANTINOPLE, 1204 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe crusaders--now better styled the invaders--took Constantinople by\r\nstorm. No \"infidels\" could have treated in worse fashion this home of\r\nancient civilization. They burned down a great part of it; they\r\nslaughtered the inhabitants; they wantonly destroyed monuments, statues,\r\npaintings, and manuscripts--the accumulation of a thousand years. Much of\r\nthe movable wealth they carried away. Never, declared an eye-witness of\r\nthe scene, had there been such plunder since the world began.\r\n\r\nTHE LATIN EMPIRE OF CONSTANTINOPLE, 1204-1261 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe victors hastened to divide between them the lands of the Roman Empire\r\nin the East. Venice gained some districts in Greece, together with nearly\r\nall the Aegean islands. The chief crusaders formed part of the remaining\r\nterritory into the Latin Empire of Constantinople. It was organized in\r\nfiefs, after the feudal manner. There was a prince of Achaia, a duke of\r\nAthens, a marquis of Corinth, and a count of Thebes. Large districts, both\r\nin Europe and Asia, did not acknowledge, however, these \"Latin\" rulers.\r\nThe new empire lived less than sixty years. At the end of this time the\r\nGreeks returned to power.\r\n\r\nDISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES OF THE FOURTH CRUSADE\r\n\r\nConstantinople, after the Fourth Crusade, declined in strength and could\r\nno longer cope with the barbarians menacing it. Two centuries later the\r\ncity fell an easy victim to the Turks. [17] The responsibility for the\r\ndisaster which gave the Turks a foothold in Europe rests on the heads of\r\nthe Venetians and the French nobles. Their greed and lust for power turned\r\nthe Fourth Crusade into a political adventure.\r\n\r\nTHE CHILDREN'S CRUSADE, 1213 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe so-called Children's Crusade illustrates at once the religious\r\nenthusiasm and misdirected zeal which marked the whole crusading movement.\r\nDuring the year 1212 A.D. thousands of French children assembled in bands\r\nand marched through the towns and villages, carrying banners, candles, and\r\ncrosses and singing, \"Lord God, exalt Christianity. Lord God, restore to\r\nus the true cross.\" The children could not be restrained at first, but\r\nfinally hunger compelled them to return home. In Germany, during the same\r\nyear, a lad named Nicholas really did succeed in launching a crusade. He\r\nled a mixed multitude of men and women, boys and girls over the Alps into\r\nItaly, where they expected to take ship for Palestine. But many perished\r\nof hardships, many were sold into slavery, and only a few ever saw their\r\nhomes again. \"These children,\" Pope Innocent III declared, \"put us to\r\nshame; while we sleep they rush to recover the Holy Land.\"\r\n\r\nEND OF THE CRUSADES\r\n\r\nThe crusading movement came to an end by the close of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. The emperor Frederick II [18] for a short time recovered\r\nJerusalem by a treaty, but in 1244 A.D. the Holy City became again a\r\npossession of the Moslems. They have never since relinquished it. Acre,\r\nthe last Christian post in Syria, fell in 1291 A.D., and with this event\r\nthe Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem ceased to exist. The Hospitalers, or\r\nKnights of St. John, still kept possession of the important islands of\r\nCyprus and Rhodes, which long served as a barrier to Moslem expansion over\r\nthe Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\n174. RESULTS OF THE CRUSADES\r\n\r\nFAILURE OF THE CRUSADES\r\n\r\nThe crusades, judged by what they set out to accomplish, must be accounted\r\nan inglorious failure. After two hundred years of conflict, after a vast\r\nexpenditure of wealth and human lives, the Holy Land remained in Moslem\r\nhands. It is true that the First Crusade did help, by the conquest of\r\nSyria, to check the advance of the Turks toward Constantinople. But even\r\nthis benefit was more than undone by the weakening of the Roman Empire in\r\nthe East as a result of the Fourth Crusade.\r\n\r\nWHY THE CRUSADES FAILED\r\n\r\nOf the many reasons for the failure of the crusades, three require special\r\nconsideration. In the first place, there was the inability of eastern and\r\nwestern Europe to cooperate in supporting the holy wars. A united\r\nChristendom might well have been invincible. But the bitter antagonism\r\nbetween the Greek and Roman churches [19] effectually prevented all unity\r\nof action. The emperors at Constantinople, after the First Crusade, rarely\r\nassisted the crusaders and often secretly hindered them. In the second\r\nplace, the lack of sea-power, as seen in the earlier crusades, worked\r\nagainst their success. Instead of being able to go by water directly to\r\nSyria, it was necessary to follow the long, overland route from France or\r\nGermany through Hungary, Bulgaria, the territory of the Roman Empire in\r\nthe East, and the deserts and mountains of Asia Minor. The armies that\r\nreached their destination after this toilsome march were in no condition\r\nfor effective campaigning. In the third place, the crusaders were never\r\nnumerous enough to colonize so large a country as Syria and absorb its\r\nMoslem population. They conquered part of Syria in the First Crusade, but\r\ncould not hold it permanently in the face of determined resistance.\r\n\r\nWHY THE CRUSADES CEASED\r\n\r\nIn spite of these and other reasons the Christians of Europe might have\r\ncontinued much longer their efforts to recover the Holy Land, had they not\r\nlost faith in the movement. But after two centuries the old crusading\r\nenthusiasm died out, the old ideal of the crusade as \"the way of God\" lost\r\nits spell. Men had begun to think less of winning future salvation by\r\nvisits to distant shrines and to think more of their present duties to the\r\nworld about them. They came to believe that Jerusalem could best be won as\r\nChrist and the Apostles had won it--\"by love, by prayers, and by the\r\nshedding of tears.\"\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE CRUSADES ON FEUDALISM\r\n\r\nThe crusades could not fail to affect in many ways the life of western\r\nEurope. For instance, they helped to undermine feudalism. Thousands of\r\nbarons and knights mortgaged or sold their lands in order to raise money\r\nfor a crusading expedition. Thousands more perished in Syria and their\r\nestates, through failure of heirs, reverted to the crown. Moreover,\r\nprivate warfare, that curse of the Middle Ages, [20] also tended to die\r\nout with the departure for the Holy Land of so many turbulent feudal\r\nlords. Their decline in both numbers and influence, and the corresponding\r\ngrowth of the royal authority, may best be traced in the changes that came\r\nabout in France, the original home of the crusading movement.\r\n\r\nTHE CRUSADES AND COMMERCE\r\n\r\nOne of the most important effects of the crusades was on commerce. They\r\ncreated a constant demand for the transportation of men and supplies,\r\nencouraged ship-building, and extended the market for eastern wares in\r\nEurope. The products of Damascus, Mosul, Alexandria, Cairo, and other\r\ngreat cities were carried across the Mediterranean to the Italian\r\nseaports, whence they found their way into all European lands. The\r\nelegance of the Orient, with its silks, tapestries, precious stones,\r\nperfumes, spices, pearls, and ivory, was so enchanting that an\r\nenthusiastic crusader called it \"the vestibule of Paradise.\"\r\n\r\nTHE CRUSADES AND INTELLECTUAL LIFE\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be noted how much the crusades contributed to\r\nintellectual and social progress. They brought the inhabitants of western\r\nEurope into close relations with one another, with their fellow Christians\r\nof the Roman Empire in the East, and with the natives of Asia Minor,\r\nSyria, and Egypt. The intercourse between Christians and Moslems was\r\nparticularly stimulating, because the East at this time surpassed the West\r\nin civilization. The crusaders enjoyed the advantages which come from\r\ntravel in strange lands and among unfamiliar peoples. They went out from\r\ntheir castles or villages to see great cities, marble palaces, superb\r\ndresses, and elegant manners; they returned with finer tastes, broader\r\nideas, and wider sympathies. Like the conquests of Alexander the Great,\r\nthe crusades opened up a new world.\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE CRUSADES\r\n\r\nWhen all is said, the crusades remain one of the most remarkable movements\r\nin history. They exhibited the nations of western Europe for the first\r\ntime making a united effort for a common end. The crusaders were not hired\r\nsoldiers, but volunteers, who, while the religious fervor lasted, gladly\r\nabandoned their homes and faced hardship and death in pursuit of a\r\nspiritual ideal. They failed to accomplish their purpose, yet humanity is\r\nthe richer for the memory of their heroism and chivalry.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

THE MONGOLS\r\n\r\nTHE ASIATIC COUNTER-ATTACK\r\n\r\nThe extensive steppes in the middle and north of Asia have formed, for\r\nthousands of years, the abode of nomadic peoples belonging to the Yellow\r\nrace. In prehistoric times they spread over northern Europe, but they were\r\ngradually supplanted by white-skinned Indo-Europeans, until now only\r\nremnants of them exist, such as the Finns and Lapps. In later ages history\r\nrecords how the Huns, the Bulgarians, and the Magyars have poured into\r\nEurope, spreading terror and destruction in their path. [1] These invaders\r\nwere followed in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries by the even more\r\nterrible Mongols and Ottoman Turks. Their inroads might well be described\r\nas Asia's reply to the crusades, as an Asiatic counter-attack upon Europe.\r\n\r\nMONGOLIA\r\n\r\nThe Mongols, who have given their name to the entire race of yellow-\r\nskinned peoples, now chiefly occupy the high plateau bounded on the north\r\nby Siberia, on the south by China, on the east by Manchuria, and on the\r\nwest by Turkestan. [2] Although the greater part of this area consists of\r\nthe Gobi desert, there are many oases and pastures available at different\r\nseasons of the year to the inhabitants. Hence the principal occupation of\r\nthe Mongols has always been cattle breeding, and their horses, oxen,\r\nsheep, and camels have always furnished them with food and clothing.\r\n\r\nMONGOL LIFE AND CHARACTER\r\n\r\nLike most nomads the Mongols dwell in tents, each family often by itself.\r\nSevere simplicity is the rule of life, for property consists of little\r\nmore than one's flocks and herds, clothes, and weapons. The modern Mongols\r\nare a peaceable, kindly folk, who have adopted from Tibet a debased form\r\nof Buddhism, but the Mongols of the thirteenth century in religion and\r\nmorals were scarcely above the level of American Indians. To ruthless\r\ncruelty and passion for plunder they added an efficiency in warfare which\r\nenabled them, within fifty years, to overrun much of Asia and the eastern\r\npart of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUT-WAGON OF THE MONGOLS (RECONSTRUCTION)\r\nOn the wagon was placed a sort of hut or pavilion made of wands bound\r\ntogether with narrow thongs. The structure was then covered with felt or\r\ncloth and provided with latticed windows. Hut-wagons, being very light,\r\nwere sometimes of enormous size.]\r\n\r\nMILITARY PROWESS OF THE MONGOLS\r\n\r\nThe daily life of the Mongols was a training school for war. Constant\r\npractice in riding, scouting, and the use of arms made every man a\r\nsoldier. The words with which an ancient Greek historian described the\r\nsavage Scythians applied perfectly to the Mongols: \"Having neither cities\r\nnor forts, and carrying their dwellings with them wherever they go;\r\naccustomed, moreover, one and all, to shoot from horseback; and living not\r\nby husbandry but on their cattle, their wagons the only houses that they\r\npossess, how can they fail of being irresistible?\" [3]\r\n\r\n\r\n176. CONQUESTS OF THE MONGOLS, 1206-1405 A.D.\r\n\r\nJENGHIZ KHAN\r\n\r\nFor ages the Mongols had dwelt in scattered tribes throughout their\r\nAsiatic wilderness, engaged in petty struggles with one another for cattle\r\nand pasture lands. It was the celebrated Jenghiz Khan, [4] chief of one of\r\nthe tribes, who brought them all under his authority and then led them to\r\nthe conquest of the world. Of him it may be said with truth that he had\r\nthe most victorious of military careers, and that he constructed the most\r\nextensive empire known to history. If Jenghiz had possessed the ability of\r\na statesman, he would have taken a place by the side of Alexander the\r\nGreat and Julius Caesar.\r\n\r\nMONGOL EMPIRE UNDER JENGHIZ, 1206-1227 A.D.\r\n\r\nJenghiz first sent the Mongol armies, which contained many Turkish allies,\r\nover the Great Wall [5] and into the fertile plains of China. All the\r\nnorthern half of the country was quickly overrun. Then Jenghiz turned\r\nwestward and invaded Turkestan and Persia. Seven centuries have not\r\nsufficed to repair the damage which the Mongols wrought in this once-\r\nprosperous land. The great cities of Bokhara, Samarkand, Merv, and Herat,\r\n[6] long centers of Moslem culture, were pillaged and burned, and their\r\ninhabitants were put to the sword. Like the Huns the Mongols seemed a\r\nscourge sent by God. Still further conquests enlarged the empire, which at\r\nthe death of Jenghiz in 1227 A.D. stretched from the Dnieper River to the\r\nChina Sea.\r\n\r\nMONGOL EMPIRE UNDER THE SUCCESSORS OF JENGHIZ\r\n\r\nThe Mongol dominions in the thirteenth century were increased by the\r\naddition of Korea, southern China, and Mesopotamia, as well as the greater\r\npart of Asia Minor and Russia. Japan, indeed, repulsed the Mongol hordes,\r\nbut at the other extremity of Asia they captured Bagdad, sacked the city,\r\nand brought the caliphate to an end. [7] The Mongol realm was very loosely\r\norganized, however, and during the fourteenth century it fell apart into a\r\nnumber of independent states, or khanates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, THE MONGOL EMPIRE]\r\n\r\nTIMUR THE LAME, DIED 1405 A.D.\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for another renowned Oriental monarch, Timur the Lame, [8]\r\nto restore the empire of Jenghiz Khan. His biographers traced his descent\r\nfrom that famous Mongol, but Timur was a Turk and an adherent of Islam. He\r\nhas come down to us as perhaps the most terrible personification in\r\nhistory of the evil spirit of conquest. Such distant regions as India,\r\nSyria, Armenia, Asia Minor, and Russia were traversed by Timur's soldiers,\r\nwho left behind them only the smoking ruins of a thousand cities and\r\nabominable trophies in the shape of columns or pyramids of human heads.\r\nTimur died in his seventieth year, while leading his troops against China,\r\nand the extensive empire which he had built up in Asia soon crumbled to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMB OF TIMUR AT SAMARKAND\r\nSamarkand in Russian Central Asia became Timur's capital in 1369 AD. The\r\ncity was once a center of Mohammedan wealth and culture, famous for its\r\nbeautiful mosques, palaces, and colleges. The Gur-Amir, or tomb of Timur,\r\nconsists of a chapel, crowned by a dome and enclosed by a wall. Time and\r\nearthquakes have greatly injured this fine building. The remains of Timur\r\nlie here under a huge block of jade.]\r\n\r\n\r\n177. THE MONGOLS IN CHINA AND INDIA\r\n\r\nMONGOL SWAY IN CHINA\r\n\r\nThe Mongols ruled over China for about one hundred and fifty years. During\r\nthis period they became thoroughly imbued with Chinese culture. \"China,\"\r\nsaid an old writer, \"is a sea that salts all the rivers flowing into it.\"\r\nThe most eminent of the Mongol emperors was Jenghiz Khan's grandson,\r\nKublai (1259-1294 A.D.). He built a new capital, which in medieval times\r\nwas known as Cambaluc and is now called Peking. While Kublai was on the\r\nthrone, the Venetian traveler, Marco Polo, [9] visited China, and he\r\ndescribes in glowing colors the virtues and glories of the \"Great Khan.\"\r\nThere appears to have been considerable trade between Europe and China at\r\nthis time, and Franciscan missionaries and papal legates penetrated to the\r\nremote East. After the downfall of the Mongol dynasty in 1368 A.D. China\r\nagain shut her doors to foreign peoples. All intercourse with Europe\r\nceased until the arrival of the Portuguese in the sixteenth century. [10]\r\n\r\nTIMUR AND BABER IN INDIA\r\n\r\nNorthern India, which in earlier ages had witnessed the coming of Persian,\r\nMacedonian, and Arabian conquerors, did not escape visitations by fresh\r\nAsiatic hordes. Timur the Lame, at the head of an innumerable host, rushed\r\ndown upon the banks of the Indus and the Ganges and sacked Delhi, making\r\nthere a full display of his unrivaled ferocity. Timur's invasion left no\r\npermanent impress on the history of India, but its memory fired the\r\nimagination of another Turkish chieftain, Baber, a remote descendant of\r\nTimur. In 1525 A.D. he invaded India and speedily made himself master of\r\nthe northern part of the country.\r\n\r\nEMPIRE OF THE MOGULS\r\n\r\nThe empire which Baber established in India is known as that of the\r\nMoguls, an Arabic form of the word Mongol. The Moguls, however, were\r\nTurkish in blood and Mohammedans in religion. The Mogul emperors reigned\r\nin great splendor from their capitals at Delhi and Agra, until the decline\r\nof their power in the eighteenth century opened the way for the British\r\nconquest of India.\r\n\r\n\r\n178. THE MONGOLS IN EASTERN EUROPE\r\n\r\nMONGOL CONQUEST OF RUSSIA, 1237-1240 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe location of Russia [11] on the border of Asia exposed that country to\r\nthe full force of the Mongol attack. Jenghiz Khan's successors, entering\r\nEurope north of the Caspian, swept resistlessly over the Russian plain.\r\nMoscow and Kiev fell in quick succession, and before long the greater part\r\nof Russia was in the hands of the Mongols. Wholesale massacres marked\r\ntheir progress. \"No eye remained open to weep for the dead.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TAJ MAHAL, AGRA\r\nErected by the Mogul emperor, Shah Jehan, as a tomb for his favorite wife,\r\nMuntaz Mahal. It was begun in 1632 A.D. and was completed in twenty-two\r\nyears. The material is pure white marble, inlaid with jasper, agate and\r\nother precious stones. The building rests on a marble terrace, at each\r\ncorner of which rises a tall graceful minaret. The extreme delicacy of the\r\nTaj Mahal and the richness of its ornamentation make it a masterpiece of\r\narchitecture.]\r\n\r\nINVASION OF POLAND AND HUNGARY BY THE MONGOLS, 1241 A.D.\r\n\r\nStill the invaders pressed on. They devastated Hungary, driving the Magyar\r\nking in panic flight from his realm. They overran Poland. At a great\r\nbattle in Silesia they destroyed the knighthood of Germany and filled nine\r\nsacks with the right ears of slaughtered enemies. The European peoples,\r\ntaken completely by surprise, could offer no effective resistance to these\r\nAsiatics, who combined superiority in numbers with surpassing generalship.\r\nSince the Arab attack in the eighth century Christendom had never been in\r\ngraver peril. But the wave of Mongol invasion, which threatened to engulf\r\nEurope in barbarism, receded as quickly as it came. The Mongols soon\r\nabandoned Poland and Hungary and retired to their possessions in Russia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, RUSSIA AT THE END OF THE MIDDLE AGES]\r\n\r\nTHE \"GOLDEN HORDE\"\r\n\r\nThe ruler of the \"Golden Horde,\" as the western section of the Mongol\r\nEmpire was called, continued to be the lord of Russia for about two\r\nhundred and fifty years. Russia, throughout this period, was little more\r\nthan a dependency of Asia. The conquered people were obliged to pay a\r\nheavy tribute and to furnish soldiers for the Mongol armies. Their\r\nprinces, also, became vassals of the Great Khan.\r\n\r\nMONGOL INFLUENCE ON RUSSIA\r\n\r\nThe Mongols, or \"Tartars\" [12] are usually said to have Orientalized\r\nRussia. It seems clear, however, that they did not interfere with the\r\nlanguage, religion, and laws of their subjects. The chief result of the\r\nMongol supremacy was to cut off Russia from western Europe, just at the\r\ntime when England, France, Germany, and Italy were emerging from the\r\ndarkness of the early Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nRISE OF MUSCOVY\r\n\r\nThe invasion of the Mongols proved to be, indirectly, the making of the\r\nRussian state. Before they came the country was a patchwork of rival, and\r\noften warring, principalities. The need of union against the common enemy\r\nwelded them together. The principality of Muscovy, so named from the\r\ncapital city of Moscow, conquered its neighbors, annexed the important\r\ncity of Novgorod, whose vast possessions stretched from Lapland to the\r\nUrals, and finally became powerful enough to shake off the Mongol yoke.\r\n\r\nREIGN OF IVAN III, THE GREAT, 1462-1505 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe final deliverance of Russia from the Mongols was accomplished by Ivan\r\nIII, surnamed the Great. This ruler is also regarded as the founder of\r\nRussian autocracy, that is, of a personal, absolute, and arbitrary\r\ngovernment. With a view to strengthening his claim to be the political\r\nheir of the eastern emperors, Ivan married a niece of the last ruler at\r\nConstantinople, who in 1453 A.D. had fallen in the defense of his capital\r\nagainst the Ottoman Turks. Henceforth the Russian ruler described himself\r\nas \"the new Tsar [13] Constantine in the new city of Constantine, Moscow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n179. THE OTTOMAN TURKS AND THEIR CONQUESTS, 1227-1453 A.D.\r\n\r\nRISE OF THE OTTOMANS\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of the Ottoman Turks in history dates from 1227 A.D.,\r\nthe year of Jenghiz Khan's death. In that year a small Turkish horde,\r\ndriven westward from their central Asian homes by the Mongol advance,\r\nsettled in Asia Minor. There they enjoyed the protection of their kinsmen,\r\nthe Seljuk Turks, and from them accepted Islam. As the Seljuk power\r\ndeclined, that of the Ottomans rose in its stead. About 1300 A.D. their\r\nchieftain, Othman, [14] declared his independence and became the founder\r\nof the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nOTTOMAN EXPANSION\r\n\r\nThe growth of the Ottoman power was almost as rapid as that of the Arabs\r\nor of the Mongols. During the first half of the fourteenth century they\r\nfirmly established themselves in northwestern Asia Minor, along the\r\nbeautiful shores washed by the Bosporus, the Sea of Marmora, and the\r\nDardanelles. The second half of the same century found them in Europe,\r\nwresting province after province from the feeble hands of the eastern\r\nemperors. First came the seizure of Gallipoli on the Dardanelles, which\r\nlong remained the principal Turkish naval station. Then followed the\r\ncapture of Adrianople, where in earlier centuries the Visigoths had\r\ndestroyed a Roman army. [15] By 1400 A.D. all that remained of the Roman\r\nEmpire in the East was Constantinople and a small district in the vicinity\r\nof that city.\r\n\r\nTHE JANIZARIES\r\n\r\nThe Turks owed much of their success to the famous body of troops known as\r\nJanizaries. [16] These were recruited for the most part from Christian\r\nchildren surrendered by their parents as tribute. The Janizaries received\r\nan education in the Moslem faith and careful instruction in the use of\r\narms. Their discipline and fanatic zeal made them irresistible on the\r\nfield of battle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOHAMMED II\r\nA medal showing the strong face of the conqueror of Constantinople]\r\n\r\nCONSTANTINOPLE BESIEGED\r\n\r\nConstantinople had never recovered from the blow inflicted upon it by the\r\nfreebooters of the Fourth Crusade. [17] It was isolated from western\r\nEurope by the advance of the Turks. Frantic appeals for help brought only\r\na few ships and men from Genoa and Venice. When in 1453 A.D. the sultan\r\nMohammed II, commanding a large army amply supplied with artillery,\r\nappeared before the walls, all men knew that Constantinople was doomed.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF THE CITY\r\n\r\nThe defense of the city forms one of the most stirring episodes in\r\nhistory. The Christians, not more than eight thousand in number, were a\r\nmere handful compared to the Ottoman hordes. Yet they held out for nearly\r\ntwo months against every assault. When at length the end drew near, the\r\nRoman emperor, Constantine Palaeologus, a hero worthy of the name he bore,\r\nwent with his followers at midnight to Sancta Sophia and there in that\r\nsolemn fane received a last communion. Before sunrise on the following day\r\nthe Turks were within the walls. The emperor, refusing to survive the city\r\nwhich he could not save, fell in the onrush of the Janizaries.\r\nConstantinople endured a sack of three days, during which many works of\r\nart, previously spared by the crusaders, were destroyed. Mohammed II then\r\nmade a triumphal entry into the city and in Sancta Sophia, now stripped of\r\nits crosses, images, and other Christian emblems, proclaimed the faith of\r\nthe prophet. And so the \"Turkish night,\" as Slavic poets named it,\r\ndescended on this ancient home of civilization.\r\n\r\nAN EPOCH-MAKING EVENT\r\n\r\nThe capture of Constantinople is rightly regarded as an epoch-making\r\nevent. It meant the end, once for all, of the empire which had served so\r\nlong as the rearguard of Christian civilization, as the bulwark of the\r\nWest against the East. Europe stood aghast at a calamity which she had\r\ndone so little to prevent. The Christian powers of the West have been\r\npaying dearly, even to our own time, for their failure to save New Rome\r\nfrom infidel hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n180. THE OTTOMAN TURKS IN SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE\r\n\r\nCONTINUED OTTOMAN EXPANSION\r\n\r\nTurkey was now a European state. After the occupation of Constantinople\r\nthe Ottoman territories continued to expand, and at the death of Mohammed\r\nII they included what are now Bulgaria, Rumania, Serbia, Albania, and\r\nGreece. Of all the Balkan states only tiny Montenegro, protected by\r\nmountain ramparts, preserved its independence.\r\n\r\nNATURE OF TURKISH RULE\r\n\r\nThe Turks form a small minority among the inhabitants of the Balkans. At\r\nthe present time there are said to be less than one million Turks in\r\nsoutheastern Europe. Even about Constantinople the Greeks far outnumber\r\nthem. The Turks from the outset have been, not a nation in the proper\r\nsense of the word, but rather an army of occupation, holding down by force\r\ntheir far more numerous Christian subjects.\r\n\r\nTHE TURKS A MIXED PEOPLE\r\n\r\nThe people who thus acquired dominion over all southeastern Europe had\r\nbecome, even at the middle of the fifteenth century, greatly mixed in\r\nblood. Their ancestors were natives of central Asia, but in Europe they\r\nintermarried freely with their Christian captives and with converts from\r\nChristianity to Islam. So far has this admixture proceeded that the modern\r\nTurks are almost entirely European in physique.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, EMPIRE OF THE OTTOMAN TURKS AT THE FALL OF\r\nCONSTANTINOPLE, 1453 A.D.]\r\n\r\nISOLATION OF THE TURKS\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians, who came out of Asia to devastate Europe, at length turned\r\nChristian, adopted a Slavic speech, and entered the family of European\r\nnations. The Magyars, who followed them, also made their way into the\r\nfellowship of Christendom. Quite the opposite has been the case with the\r\nTurks. Preserving their Asiatic language and Moslem faith, they have\r\nremained in southeastern Europe, not a transitory scourge, but an abiding\r\noppressor of Christian lands. Every century since 1453 A.D. has widened\r\nthe gulf between them and their subjects.\r\n\r\nTURKISH INFLUENCE IN SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE\r\n\r\nThe isolation of the Turks has prevented them from assimilating the higher\r\nculture of the peoples whom they conquered. They have never created\r\nanything in science, art, literature, commerce, or industry. Conquest has\r\nbeen the Turks' one business in the world, and when they ceased conquering\r\ntheir decline set in. But it was not till the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury that the Turkish Empire entered on that downward road which is now\r\nfast leading to its extinction as a European power.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

GROWTH OF THE NATIONS\r\n\r\nTHE NEW NATIONALISM\r\n\r\nThe map of western Europe, that is, of Europe west of the great Russian\r\nplain and the Balkan peninsula, shows this part of the continent at\r\npresent divided into no less than thirteen separate and independent\r\nnations. Most of them arose during the latter part of the Middle Ages.\r\nThey have existed so long that we now think of the national state as the\r\nhighest type of human association, forgetting that it has been preceded by\r\nother forms of political organization, such as the Greek republic, the\r\nRoman Empire, and the feudal state, and that it may be followed some day\r\nby an international or universal state composed of all civilized peoples.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL STATE AND FEUDALISM\r\n\r\nThese national states were the successors of feudalism. The establishment\r\nof the feudal system in any country meant, as has been seen, its division\r\ninto numerous small communities, each with a law court, treasury, and\r\narmy. This system of local government helped to keep order in an age of\r\nconfusion, but it did not meet the needs of a progressive society. In most\r\nparts of Europe the feudal states gradually gave way to centralized\r\ngovernments ruled by despotic kings.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW MONARCHIES\r\n\r\nA feudal king was often little more than a figurehead, equaled, or perhaps\r\nsurpassed, in power by some of his own vassals. But in England, France,\r\nSpain, and other countries a series of astute and energetic sovereigns\r\nwere able to strengthen their authority at the expense of the nobles. They\r\nformed permanent armies by insisting that all military service should be\r\nrendered to themselves and not to the feudal lords. They got into their\r\nown hands the administration of justice. They developed a revenue system,\r\nwith the taxes collected by royal officers and deposited in the royal\r\ntreasury. The kings thus succeeded in creating in each country one power\r\nwhich all the inhabitants feared, respected, and obeyed.\r\n\r\nTHE SENTIMENT OF NATIONALITY\r\n\r\nA national state in modern times is keenly conscious of its separate\r\nexistence. All its people usually speak the same language and have for\r\ntheir \"fatherland\" the warmest feelings of patriotic devotion. In the\r\nMiddle Ages, however, patriotism was commonly confounded with loyalty to\r\nthe sovereign, while the differences between nations were obscured by the\r\nexistence of an international Church and by the use of Latin as the common\r\nlanguage of all cultivated persons. The sentiment of nationality arose\r\nearlier in England than on the Continent, partly owing to the insular\r\nposition of that country, but nowhere did it become a very strong\r\ninfluence before the end of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n182. ENGLAND UNDER WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR, 1066-1087 A.D.; THE NORMAN\r\nKINGSHIP\r\n\r\nTHE LAST INVASION OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\nThe Normans were the last invaders of England. Since 1066 A.D. the English\r\nChannel, not more than twenty-one miles wide between Dover and Calais, has\r\nformed a watery barrier against Continental domination. The English\r\npeople, for eight and a half centuries, have been free to develop their\r\nideals, customs, and methods of government in their own way. We shall now\r\nlearn how they established a strong monarchy and at the same time laid\r\ndeep and firm the foundations of constitutional liberty.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM'S DESPOTIC RULE\r\n\r\nWilliam the Conqueror had won England by force of arms. He ruled it as a\r\ndespot. Those who resisted him he treated as rebels, confiscating their\r\nland and giving it to Norman followers. To prevent uprisings he built a\r\ncastle in every important town and garrisoned it with his own soldiers.\r\nThe Tower of London still stands as an impressive memorial of the days of\r\nthe Conquest. But William did not rely on force alone. He sought with\r\nsuccess to attach the English to himself by retaining most of their old\r\ncustoms and by giving them an enlightened administration of the law. \"Good\r\npeace he made in this land,\" said the old Anglo-Saxon chronicler, \"so that\r\na man might travel over the kingdom with his bosom full of gold without\r\nmolestation, and no man durst kill another, however great the injury he\r\nmight have received from him.\"\r\n\r\nWILLIAM AND FEUDALISM\r\n\r\nThe feudal system on the Continent permitted a powerful noble to gather\r\nhis vassals and make war on the king, whenever he chose to do so. William\r\nhad been familiar with this evil side of feudalism, both in France and in\r\nhis own duchy of Normandy, and he determined to prevent its introduction\r\ninto England. William established the principle that a vassal owed his\r\nfirst duty to the king and not to his immediate lord. If a noble rebelled\r\nand his men followed him, they were to be treated as traitors. Rebellion\r\nproved to be an especially difficult matter in England, since the estates\r\nwhich a great lord possessed were not all in any one place but were\r\nscattered about the kingdom. A noble who planned to revolt could be put\r\ndown before he was able to collect his retainers from the most distant\r\nparts of the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE \"WHITE TOWER\"\r\nForms part of the Tower of London. Built by William the Conqueror]\r\n\r\nDOMESDAY BOOK, 1085 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe extent of William's authority is illustrated by the survey which he\r\ncaused to have made of the taxable property of the kingdom. Royal\r\ncommissioners went throughout the length and breadth of England to find\r\nout how much farm land there was in every county, how many landowners\r\nthere were, and what each man possessed, to the last ox or cow or pig. The\r\nreports were set down in the famous Domesday Book, perhaps so called\r\nbecause one could no more appeal from it than from the Last Judgment. A\r\nsimilar census of population and property had never before been taken in\r\nthe Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PASSAGE FROM DOMESDAY BOOK\r\nBeginning of the entry for Oxford. The handwriting is the beautiful\r\nCarolingian minuscule which the Norman Conquest introduced into England.\r\nThe two volumes of this compilation and the chest in which they were\r\nformerly preserved may be seen in the Public Record Office, London.]\r\n\r\nTHE SALISBURY OATH, 1086 A.D.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the close of his reign William is said to have summoned all the\r\nlandowning men in England to a great meeting on Salisbury Plain. They\r\nassembled there to the number, as it is reported, of sixty thousand and\r\npromised \"that they would be faithful to him against all other men.\" The\r\nSalisbury Oath was a national act of homage and allegiance to the king.\r\n\r\n\r\n183. ENGLAND UNDER HENRY II, 1154-1189 A.D.; ROYAL JUSTICE AND THE COMMON\r\nLAW\r\n\r\nHENRY II, PLANTAGENET\r\n Henry II, who ascended the English throne in 1154 A.D., was a grandson of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror and the first of the famous Plantagenet [2] family,\r\nHenry spent more than half of his reign abroad, looking after his\r\nextensive possessions in France but this fact did not prevent him from\r\ngiving England good government. Three things in which all Englishmen take\r\nspecial pride--the courts, the jury system, and the Common law--began to\r\ntake shape during Henry's reign.\r\n\r\nTHE KING'S COURT\r\n\r\nHenry, first of all, developed the royal court of justice. This had been,\r\nat first, simply the court of the king's chief vassals, corresponding to\r\nthe local feudal courts. [3] Henry transformed it from an occasional\r\nassembly of warlike nobles into a regular body of trained lawyers, and at\r\nthe same time opened its doors to all except serfs. In the king's court\r\nany freeman could find a justice that was cheaper and speedier than that\r\ndispensed by the feudal lords. The higher courts of England have sprung\r\nfrom this institution.\r\n\r\nCIRCUIT JUDGES\r\n\r\nHenry also took measures to bring the king's justice directly to the\r\npeople. He sent members of the royal court on circuit throughout the\r\nkingdom. At least once a year a judge was to hold an assembly in each\r\ncounty and try such cases as were brought before him. This system of\r\ncircuit judges helped to make the law uniform in all parts of England.\r\n\r\nTRIAL BY \"PETTY JURY\"\r\n\r\nThe king's court owed much of its popularity to the fact that it employed\r\na better form of trying cases than the old ordeal, oath-swearing, or\r\njudicial duel. Henry introduced a method of jury trial which had long been\r\nin use in Normandy. When a case came before the king's judges on circuit,\r\nthey were to select twelve knights, usually neighbors of the parties\r\nengaged in the dispute, to make an investigation and give a \"verdict\" [4]\r\nas to which side was in the right. These selected men bore the name of\r\n\"jurors,\" [5] because they swore to tell the truth. In Henry's time this\r\nmethod of securing justice applied only to civil cases, that is, to cases\r\naffecting land and other forms of property, but later it was extended to\r\npersons charged with criminal offenses. Thus arose the \"petty jury,\" an\r\ninstitution which nearly all European peoples have borrowed from England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINDSOR CASTLE\r\nThe town of Windsor lies on the west bank of the Thames about twenty-one\r\nmiles from London. Its famous castle has been the chief residence of\r\nEnglish sovereigns from the time of William the Conqueror. The massive\r\nround tower which forms the most conspicuous feature of the castle was\r\nbuilt by Henry III about 1272 A.D. but Edward III wholly reconstructed it\r\nabout 1344 A.D. The state apartments of the castle include the throne\r\nroom, a guard room with medieval armor a reception room adorned with\r\ntapestries picture galleries and the royal library.]\r\n\r\nACCUSATION BY THE \"GRAND JURY\"\r\n\r\nAnother of Henry's innovations developed into the \"grand jury.\" Before his\r\ntime many offenders went unpunished, especially if they were so powerful\r\nthat no private individual dared accuse them. Henry provided that when the\r\nking's justices came to a county court a number of selected men should be\r\nput upon their oath and required to give the names of any persons whom\r\nthey knew or believed to be guilty of crimes. Such persons were then to be\r\narrested and tried. This \"grand jury,\" as it came to be called, thus had\r\nthe public duty of making accusations, whether its members felt any\r\npersonal interest in the matter or not.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON LAW\r\n\r\nThe decisions handed down by the legal experts who composed the royal\r\ncourt formed the basis of the English system of jurisprudence. It received\r\nthe name Common law because it grew out of such customs as were common to\r\nthe realm, as distinguished from those which were merely local. This law,\r\nfrom Henry's II's time, became so widespread and so firmly established\r\nthat it could not be supplanted by the Roman law followed on the\r\nContinent. Carried by English colonists across the seas, it has now come\r\nto prevail throughout a great part of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n184. THE GREAT CHARTER, 1215 A.D.\r\n\r\nRICHARD I AND JOHN, 1189-1216 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe great Henry, from whose legal reforms English-speaking peoples receive\r\nbenefit even to-day, was followed by his son, Richard, the Lion-hearted\r\ncrusader. [6] After a short reign Richard was succeeded by his brother,\r\nJohn, a man so cruel, tyrannical, and wicked that he is usually regarded\r\nas the worst of English kings. In a war with the French ruler, Philip\r\nAugustus, John lost Normandy and some of the other English possessions on\r\nthe Continent. [7] In a dispute with Innocent III he ended by making an\r\nabject submission to the Papacy. [8] Finally, John's oppressive government\r\nprovoked a revolt, and he was forced to grant the charter of privileges\r\nknown as Magna Carta.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, DOMINIONS OF THE PLANTAGENETS IN ENGLAND AND FRANCE]\r\n\r\nWINNING OF MAGNA CARTA, 1215 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Norman Conquest had made the king so strong that his authority could\r\nbe resisted only by a union of all classes of the people. The feudal lords\r\nwere obliged to unite with the clergy and the commons, [9] in order to\r\nsave their honor, their estates, and their heads. Matters came to a crisis\r\nin 1215 A.D., when the nobles, supported by the archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nplaced their demands for reform in writing before the king. John swore\r\nfuriously that they were \"idle dreams without a shadow of reason\" and\r\nrefused to make any concessions. Thereupon the nobles formed the \"army of\r\nGod and the Holy Church,\" as it was called, and occupied London, thus\r\nranging the townspeople on their side. Deserted by all except the hired\r\ntroops which he had brought from the Continent, John was compelled to\r\nyield. At Runnimede on the Thames, not far from Windsor, he set his seal\r\nto the Great Charter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXTRACT FROM THE GREAT CHARTER\r\nFacsimile of the opening lines. Four copies of Magna Carta, sealed with\r\nthe great seal of King John, as well as several unsealed copies, are in\r\nexistence. The British Museum possesses two of the sealed copies; the\r\nother two belong to the cathedrals of Lincoln and Salisbury,\r\nrespectively.]\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF MAGNA CARTA\r\n\r\nMagna Carta does not profess to be a charter of liberties for all\r\nEnglishmen. Most of its sixty-three clauses merely guarantee to each\r\nmember of the coalition against John--nobles, clergy, and commons--those\r\nspecial privileges which the Norman rulers had tried to take away. Very\r\nlittle is said in this long document about the serfs, who composed\r\nprobably five-sixths of the population of England in the thirteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE OF MAGNA CARTA\r\n\r\nBut there are three clauses of Magna Carta which came to have a most\r\nimportant part in the history of English freedom. The first declared that\r\nno taxes were to be levied on the nobles--besides the three recognized\r\nfeudal aids [10]--except by consent of the Great Council of the realm.\r\n[11] By this clause the nobles compelled the king to secure their consent\r\nbefore imposing any taxation. The second set forth that no one was to be\r\narrested, imprisoned, or punished in any way, except after a trial by his\r\nequals and in accordance with the law of the land. The third said simply\r\nthat to no one should justice be sold, denied, or delayed. These last two\r\nclauses contained the germ of great legal principles on which the English\r\npeople relied for protection against despotic kings. They form a part of\r\nour American inheritance from England and have passed into the laws of all\r\nour states.\r\n\r\n\r\n185. PARLIAMENT DURING THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\nHENRY III, 1216-1272 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth century, which opened so auspiciously with the winning of\r\nthe Great Charter, is also memorable as the time when England developed\r\nher Parliament [12] into something like its present form. The first steps\r\nin parliamentary government were taken during the reign of John's son,\r\nHenry III.\r\n\r\nTHE WITENAGEMOT AND THE GREAT COUNCIL\r\n\r\nIt had long been the custom in England that in all important matters a\r\nruler ought not to act without the advice and consent of his leading men.\r\nThe Anglo-Saxon kings sought the advice and consent of their Witenagemot,\r\n[13] a body of nobles, royal officers, bishops, and abbots. It approved\r\nlaws, served as a court of final appeal, elected a new monarch, and at\r\ntimes deposed him. The Witenagemot did not disappear after the Norman\r\nConquest. Under the name of the Great Council it continued to meet from\r\ntime to time for consultation with the king. This assembly was now to be\r\ntransformed from a feudal body into a parliament representing the entire\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nSIMON DE MONTFORT'S PARLIAMENT, 1265 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Great Council, which by one of the provisions of Magna Carta had been\r\nrequired to give its consent to the levying of feudal dues, met quite\r\nfrequently during Henry III's reign. On one occasion, when Henry was in\r\nurgent need of money and the bishops and lords refused to grant it, the\r\nking took the significant step of calling to the council two knights from\r\neach county to declare what aid they would give him. These knights, so ran\r\nHenry's summons, were to come \"in the stead of each and all,\" in other\r\nwords, they were to act as representatives of the counties. Then in 1265\r\nA.D., when the nobles were at war with the king, a second and even more\r\nsignificant step was taken. Their leader, Simon de Montfort, summoned to\r\nthe council not only two knights from each county, but also two citizens\r\nfrom each of the more important towns.\r\n\r\nTHE REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThe custom of selecting certain men to act in the name and on the behalf\r\nof the community had existed during Anglo-Saxon times in local government.\r\nRepresentatives of the counties had been employed by the Norman kings to\r\nact as assessors in levying taxes. As we have just learned, the \"juries\"\r\nof Henry II also consisted of such representatives. The English people, in\r\nfact, were quite familiar with the idea of representation long before it\r\nwas applied on a larger scale to Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"MODEL PARLIAMENT\" OF EDWARD I, 1295 A.D.\r\n\r\nSimon de Montfort's Parliament included only his own supporters, and hence\r\nwas not a truly national body. But it made a precedent for the future.\r\nThirty years later Edward I called together at Westminster, now a part of\r\nLondon, a Parliament which included all classes of the people. Here were\r\npresent archbishops, bishops, and abbots, earls and barons, two knights\r\nfrom every county, and two townsmen to represent each town in that county.\r\nAfter this time all these classes were regularly summoned to meet in\r\nassembly at Westminster.\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF LORDS AND HOUSE OF COMMONS\r\n\r\nThe separation of Parliament into two chambers came in the fourteenth\r\ncentury. The House of Lords included the nobles and higher clergy, the\r\nHouse of Commons, the representatives from counties and cities. This\r\nbicameral arrangement, as it is called, has been followed in the\r\nparliaments of most modern countries.\r\n\r\nPOWERS OF PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\nThe early English Parliament was not a law-making but a tax-voting body.\r\nThe king would call the two houses in session only when he needed their\r\nsanction for raising money. Parliament in its turn would refuse to grant\r\nsupplies until the king had corrected abuses in the administration or had\r\nremoved unpopular officials. This control of the public purse in time\r\nenabled Parliament to grasp other powers. It became an accepted principle\r\nthat royal officials were responsible to Parliament for their actions,\r\nthat the king himself might be deposed for good cause, and that bills,\r\nwhen passed by Parliament and signed by the king, were the law of the\r\nland. England thus worked out in the Middle Ages a system of parliamentary\r\ngovernment which nearly all civilized nations have held worthy of\r\nimitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n186. EXPANSION OF ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD I, 1272-1307 A.D.\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH ISLES\r\n\r\nOur narrative has been confined until now to England, which forms,\r\ntogether with Wales and Scotland, the island known as Great Britain.\r\nIreland is the only other important division of the United Kingdom. It was\r\nalmost inevitable that in process of time the British Isles should have\r\ncome under a single government, but political unity has not yet fused\r\nEnglish, Scotch, Welsh, and Irish into a single people.\r\n\r\nWALES\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Britain by the Anglo-Saxons drove many of the Welsh, [14]\r\nas the invaders called the Britons, into the western part of the island.\r\nThis district, henceforth known as Wales, was one of the last strongholds\r\nof the Celts. Even to-day a variety of the old Celtic language, called\r\nCymric, is still spoken by the Welsh people.\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF WALES\r\n\r\nIn their wild and mountainous country the Welsh long resisted all attempts\r\nto subjugate them. Harold exerted some authority over Wales, William the\r\nConqueror entered part of it, and Henry II induced the local rulers to\r\nacknowledge him as overlord, but it was Edward I who first brought all\r\nWales under English sway. Edward fostered the building of towns in his new\r\npossession, divided it into counties or shires, after the system that\r\nprevailed in England, and introduced the Common law. He called his son,\r\nEdward II, who was born in the country, the \"Prince of Wales,\" and this\r\ntitle has ever since been borne by the heir apparent to the English\r\nthrone. The work of uniting Wales to England went on slowly, and two\r\ncenturies elapsed before Wales was granted representation in the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORONATION CHAIR, WESTMINSTER ABBEY\r\nEvery English ruler since Edward I has been crowned in this oak chair.\r\nUnder the seat is the \"Stone of Scone,\" said to have been once used by the\r\npatriarch Jacob. Edward I brought it to London in 1291 A.D., as a token of\r\nthe subjection of Scotland.]\r\n\r\nSCOTLAND\r\n\r\nScotland derives its name from the Scots, who came over from Ireland early\r\nin the fifth century. [15] The northern Highlands, a nest of rugged\r\nmountains washed by cold and stormy seas, have always been occupied in\r\nhistoric times by a Celtic-speaking people, whose language, called Gaelic,\r\nis not yet extinct there. This part of Scotland, like Wales, was a home of\r\nfreedom. The Romans did not attempt to annex the Highlands, and the Anglo-\r\nSaxons and Danes never penetrated their fastnesses. On the other hand the\r\nsouthern Lowlands, which include only about one-third of Scotland, were\r\nsubdued by the Teutonic invaders, and so this district became thoroughly\r\nEnglish in language and culture. [16]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, SCOTLAND in the 13th Century]\r\n\r\nTHE SCOTTOSH KINGDOM\r\n\r\nOne might suppose that the Lowlands, geographically only an extension of\r\nnorthern England and inhabited by an English-speaking people, would have\r\nearly united with the southern kingdom. But matters turned out otherwise.\r\nThe Lowlands and the Highlands came together under a line of Celtic kings,\r\nwho fixed their residence at Edinburgh and long maintained their\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nSCOTLAND ANNEXED BY EDWARD I\r\n\r\nEdward I, having conquered Wales, took advantage of the disturbed\r\nconditions which prevailed in Scotland to interfere in the affairs of that\r\ncountry. The Scotch offered a brave but futile resistance under William\r\nWallace. This heroic leader, who held out after most of his countrymen\r\nsubmitted, was finally captured and executed. His head, according to the\r\nbarbarous practice of the time, was set upon a pole on London Bridge. The\r\nEnglish king now annexed Scotland without further opposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A QUEEN ELEANOR CROSS\r\nAfter the death of his wife Eleanor, Edward I caused a memorial cross to\r\nbe set up at each place where her funeral procession had stopped on its\r\nway to London. There were originally seven crosses. Of the three that\r\nstill exist, the Geddington cross is the best preserved. It consists of\r\nthree stories and stands on a platform of eight steps.]\r\n\r\nROBERT BRUCE AND BANNOCKBURN, 1314 A.D.\r\n\r\nBut William Wallace by his life and still more by his death had lit a fire\r\nwhich might never be quenched. Soon the Scotch found another champion in\r\nthe person of Robert Bruce. Edward I, now old and broken, marched against\r\nhim, but died before reaching the border. The weakness of his son, Edward\r\nII, permitted the Scotch, ably led by Bruce, to win the signal victory of\r\nBannockburn, near Stirling Castle. Here the Scottish spearmen drove the\r\nEnglish knighthood into ignominious flight and freed their country from\r\nits foreign overlords.\r\n\r\nSCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\nThe battle of Bannockburn made a nation. A few years afterwards the\r\nEnglish formally recognized the independence of the northern kingdom. So\r\nthe great design of Edward I to unite all the peoples of Britain under one\r\ngovernment had to be postponed for centuries. [17]\r\n\r\nIRELAND\r\n\r\nNo one kingdom ever arose in Ireland out of the numerous tribes into which\r\nthe Celtic-speaking inhabitants were divided. The island was not troubled,\r\nhowever, by foreign invaders till the coming of the Northmen in the ninth\r\ncentury. [18] The English, who first entered Ireland during the reign of\r\nHenry II, did not complete its conquest till the seventeenth century.\r\nIreland by its situation could scarcely fail to become an appanage of\r\nGreat Britain, but the dividing sea has combined with differences in race,\r\nlanguage, and religion, and with English misgovernment, to prevent\r\nanything like a genuine union of the conquerors and the conquered.\r\n\r\n\r\n187. UNIFICATION OF FRANCE, 987-1328 A.D.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL FRANCE\r\n\r\nNature seems to have intended that France should play a leading part in\r\nEuropean affairs. The geographical unity of the country is obvious.\r\nMountains and seas form its permanent boundaries, except on the north-east\r\nwhere the frontier is not well defined. The western coast of France opens\r\non the Atlantic, now the greatest highway of the world's commerce, while\r\non the southeast France touches the Mediterranean, the home of classical\r\ncivilization. This intermediate position between two seas helps us to\r\nunderstand why French history should form, as it were, a connecting link\r\nbetween ancient and modern times.\r\n\r\nRACIAL FRANCE\r\n\r\nBut the greatness of France has been due, also, to the qualities of the\r\nFrench people. Many racial elements have contributed to the population.\r\nThe blood of prehistoric tribes, whose monuments and grave mounds are\r\nscattered over the land, still flows in the veins of Frenchmen. At the\r\nopening of historic times France was chiefly occupied by the Celts, whom\r\nJulius Caesar found there and subdued. The Celts, or Gauls, have formed in\r\nlater ages the main stock of the French nation, but their language gave\r\nplace to Latin after the Roman conquest. In the course of five hundred\r\nyears the Gauls were so thoroughly Romanized that they may best be\r\ndescribed as Gallo-Romans. The Burgundians, Franks, and Northmen\r\nafterwards added a Teutonic element to the population, as well as some\r\ninfusion of Teutonic laws and customs.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPETIAN DYNASTY\r\n\r\nFrance, again, became a great nation because of the greatness of its\r\nrulers. Hugh Capet, who became the French king in 987 A.D., [19] was\r\nfortunate in his descendants. The Capetian dynasty was long lived, and for\r\nmore than three centuries son followed father on the throne without a\r\nbreak in the succession. [20] During this time the French sovereigns\r\nworked steadily to exalt the royal power and to unite the feudal states of\r\nmedieval France into a real nation under a common government. Their\r\nsuccess in this task made them, at the close of the Middle Ages, the\r\nstrongest monarchs in Europe.\r\n\r\nFRANCE AND ITS FIEFS\r\n\r\nHugh Capet's duchy--the original France--included only a small stretch of\r\ninland country centering about Paris on the Seine and Orléans on the\r\nLoire. His election to the kingship did not increase his power over the\r\ngreat lords who ruled in Normandy, Brittany, Aquitaine, Burgundy, and\r\nother parts of the country. They did homage to the king for their fiefs\r\nand performed the usual feudal services, but otherwise regarded themselves\r\nas independent in their own territories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, UNIFICATION OF FRANCE DURING THE MIDDLE AGES]\r\n\r\nPHILIP II, AUGUSTUS, 1180-1223 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe most considerable additions to the royal domains were made by Philip\r\nII, called Augustus. We have already referred to his contest with Pope\r\nInnocent III and to his participation in the Third Crusade. [21] The\r\nEnglish king, John, was Philip's vassal for Normandy and other provinces\r\nin France. A quarrel between the two rulers gave Philip an opportunity to\r\ndeclare John's fiefs forfeited by feudal law. Philip then seized all the\r\nEnglish possessions north of the river Loire. The loss of these\r\npossessions abroad had the result of separating England almost completely\r\nfrom Continental interests; for France it meant a great increase in\r\nterritory and population. Philip made Paris his chief residence, and that\r\ncity henceforth became the capital of France.\r\n\r\nLOUIS IX, THE SAINT, 1226-1276 A.D.\r\n\r\nDuring the long reign of Philip's grandson, Louis IX, rich districts to\r\nthe west of the Rhone were added to the royal domains. This king, whose\r\nChristian virtues led to his canonization, distinguished himself as an\r\nadministrator. His work in unifying France may be compared with that of\r\nHenry II in England. He decreed that only the king's money was to\r\ncirculate in the provinces owned directly by himself, thus limiting the\r\nright of coinage enjoyed by feudal lords. He restricted very greatly the\r\nright of private war and forbade the use of judicial duels. Louis also\r\nprovided that important cases could be appealed from feudal courts to the\r\nking's judges, who sat in Paris and followed in their decisions the\r\nprinciples of Roman law. In these and other ways he laid the foundations\r\nof absolute monarchy in France.\r\n\r\nPHILIP IV, THE FAIR, 1265-1314 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe grandson of St. Louis, Philip IV, did much to organize a financial\r\nsystem for France. Now that the kingdom had become so large and powerful,\r\nthe old feudal dues were insufficient to pay the salaries of the royal\r\nofficials and support a standing army. Philip resorted to new methods of\r\nraising revenue by imposing various taxes and by requiring the feudal\r\nlords to substitute payments in money for the military service due from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTHE ESTATES-GENERAL\r\n\r\nPhilip also called into existence the Estates-General, an assembly in\r\nwhich the clergy, the nobles, and representatives from the commons (the\r\n\"third estate\") met as separate bodies and voted grants of money. The\r\nEstates-General arose almost at the same time as the English Parliament,\r\nto which it corresponded, but it never secured the extensive authority of\r\nthat body. After a time the kings of France became so powerful that they\r\nmanaged to reign without once summoning the nation in council. The French\r\ndid not succeed, as the English had done, in founding political liberty\r\nupon the vote and control of taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n188. THE HUNDRED YEARS' WAR BETWEEN FRANCE AND ENGLAND, 1337-1453 A.D.\r\n\r\nPRETEXT FOR THE WAR\r\n\r\nThe task of unifying France was interrupted by a deplorable war between\r\nthat country and England. It continued, including periods of truce, for\r\nover a century. The pretext for the war was found in a disputed\r\nsuccession. In 1328 A.D. the last of the three sons of Philip IV passed\r\naway, and the direct line of the house of Capet, which had reigned over\r\nFrance for more than three hundred years, came to an end. The English\r\nruler, Edward III, whose mother was the daughter of Philip IV, considered\r\nhimself the next lineal heir. The French nobles were naturally unwilling\r\nto receive a foreigner as king, and gave the throne, instead, to a nephew\r\nof Philip IV. This decision was afterwards justified on the ground that,\r\nby the old law of the Salian Franks, women could neither inherit estates\r\nnor transmit them to a son. [22]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROYAL ARMS OF EDWARD III\r\nEdward III, having in 1340 A.D. set up a claim to the throne of France,\r\nproceeded to add the French lilies (_fleurs-de-lis_) to his coat of arms.\r\nHe also took as his motto _Dieu et mon Droit_ (\"God and my Right\"). The\r\nlilies of France remained in the royal arms till 1801 A.D.; the motto is\r\nstill retained.]\r\n\r\nREASONS FOR THE WAR\r\n\r\nEdward III at first accepted the situation. Philip VI, however, irritated\r\nEdward by constant encroachments on the territories which the English\r\nstill kept in France. Philip also allied himself with the Scotch and\r\ninterfered with English trade interests in the county of Flanders. [23]\r\nThis attitude of hostility provoked retaliation. Edward now reasserted his\r\nclaim to the crown of France and prepared by force of arms to make it\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGLISH ARCHER\r\nFrom an old manuscript.]\r\n\r\nBATTLES OF CRÉCY, 1346 A.D., AND POITIERS, 1356 A.D.\r\n\r\nIn 1346 A.D. Edward led his troops across the Channel and at Crécy gained\r\na complete victory over the knighthood of France. Ten years later the\r\nEnglish at Poitiers almost annihilated another French force much superior\r\nin numbers. These two battles were mainly won by foot soldiers armed with\r\nthe long bow, in the use of which the English excelled. Ordinary iron mail\r\ncould not resist the heavy, yard-long arrows, which fell with murderous\r\neffect upon the bodies of men and horses alike. Henceforth infantry, when\r\nproperly armed and led, were to prove themselves on many a bloody field\r\nmore than a match for feudal cavalry. The long bow, followed later by the\r\nmusket, struck a deadly blow at feudalism.\r\n\r\nTHE \"BLACK PRINCE\"\r\n\r\nEdward's son, the Prince of Wales, when only sixteen years of age, won his\r\nspurs by distinguished conduct at Crécy. It was the \"Black Prince,\" [24]\r\nalso, who gained the day at Poitiers, where he took prisoner the French\r\nking, John. Toward his royal captive he behaved in chivalrous fashion. At\r\nsupper, on the evening of the battle, he stood behind John's chair and\r\nwaited on him, praising the king's brave deeds. But this \"flower of\r\nknighthood,\" who regarded warfare as only a tournament on a larger scale,\r\ncould be ruthless in his treatment of the common people. On one occasion\r\nhe caused three thousand inhabitants of a captured town--men, women and\r\nchildren--to be butchered before his eyes. The incident shows how far\r\napart in the Middle Ages were chivalry and humanity.\r\n\r\nRENEWAL OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nThe English, in spite of their victories, could not conquer France. The\r\nFrench refused to fight more pitched battles and retired to their castles\r\nand fortified towns. The war almost ceased for many years after the death\r\nof Edward III. It began again early in the fifteenth century, and the\r\nEnglish this time met with more success. They gained possession of almost\r\nall France north of the Loire, except the important city of Orléans. Had\r\nthe English taken it, French resistance must have collapsed. That they did\r\nnot take it was due to one of the most remarkable women in history--Joan\r\nof Arc. [25]\r\n\r\nTHE \"MAID OF ORLÉANS,\" 1429 A.D.\r\n\r\nJoan was a peasant girl, a native of the little village of Domremy. Always\r\na devout and imaginative child, she early began to see visions of saints\r\nand angels and to hear mysterious voices. At the time of the siege of\r\nOrléans the archangel Michael appeared to her, so she declared, and bade\r\nher go forth and save France. Joan obeyed, and though barely seventeen\r\nyears of age made her way to the court of the French king. There her\r\npiety, simplicity, and evident faith in her mission overcame all doubts.\r\nClad in armor, girt with an ancient sword, and with a white banner borne\r\nbefore her, Joan was allowed to accompany an army for the relief of\r\nOrléans. She inspired the French with such enthusiasm that they quickly\r\ncompelled the English to raise the siege. Then Joan led her king to Reims\r\nand stood beside him at his coronation in the cathedral.\r\n\r\nEND OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nThough Joan was soon afterwards captured by the English, who, to their\r\nlasting dishonor, burned her as a witch, her example nerved the French to\r\nfurther resistance. The English gradually lost ground and in 1453 A.D.,\r\nthe year of the fall of Constantinople, abandoned the effort to conquer a\r\nland much larger than their own. They retained of the French territories\r\nonly the port of Calais and the Channel Islands. [26]\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nFew wars have had less to justify them, either in their causes or in their\r\nconsequences, than this long struggle between England and France. It was a\r\ncalamity to both lands. For England it meant the dissipation abroad of the\r\nenergies which would have been better employed at home. For France it\r\nresulted in widespread destruction of property, untold suffering, famines,\r\nand terrible loss of life. From this time dates that traditional hostility\r\nbetween the two countries which was to involve them in future conflicts.\r\nOne beneficial effect the war did have. It helped to make the two nations\r\nconscious of their separate existence. The growth of a national feeling,\r\nthe awakening of a sentiment of patriotism, was especially marked in\r\nFrance, which had fought so long for independence.\r\n\r\nENGLAND AFTER THE HUNDRED YEARS' WAR\r\n\r\nShortly after the conclusion of the Hundred Years' War the two branches of\r\nthe English royal family became involved in desperate struggle for the\r\ncrown. It was known as the War of the Roses, because the house of York\r\ntook as its badge a white rose and the house of Lancaster, a red rose. The\r\ncontest lasted 1485 A.D., when the Lancastrians conquered, and their\r\nleader, Henry Tudor, ascended the throne as Henry VII. He married a\r\nYorkist wife, thus uniting the two factions, and founded the Tudor\r\ndynasty. The War of the Roses arrested the progress of English freedom. It\r\ncreated a demand for a strong monarchy which could keep order and prevent\r\ncivil strife between the nobles. The Tudors met that demand and ruled as\r\nabsolute sovereigns. It was more than a century before Parliament,\r\nrepresenting the people, could begin to win back free government. It did\r\nthis only at the cost of a revolution.\r\n\r\nFRANCE AFTER THE HUNDRED YEARS' WAR\r\n\r\nFrance also issued from the Hundred Years' War with an absolute\r\ngovernment. Strengthened by victory over the English, the French kings\r\nwere able to reduce both the nobility and the commons to impotence. During\r\nthe reign of Louis XI (1461-1483 A.D.) the royal domains were enlarged by\r\nthe addition of Anjou, Provence, and the duchy of Burgundy. His son,\r\nCharles VIII (1483-1498 A.D.), made Brittany a possession of the French\r\ncrown. The unification of France was now almost complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n189. UNIFICATION OF SPAIN (TO 1492 A.D.)\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH PENINSULA\r\n\r\nThe Spanish peninsula, known to the Romans as Hispania, is sharply\r\nseparated from the rest of Europe by the Pyrenees Mountains. At the same\r\ntime the nearness of the peninsula to Africa has always brought it into\r\nintimate relations with that continent. Just as Russia has formed a link\r\nbetween Asia and Europe, so Spain has served as a natural highway from\r\nAfrica to Europe.\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH PEOPLE\r\n\r\nThe first settlers in Spain, of whom we know anything, were the Iberians.\r\nThey may have emigrated from northern Africa. After them came the Celts,\r\nwho overran a large part of the peninsula and appear to have mingled with\r\nthe Iberians, thus forming the mixed people known as Celtiberians. In\r\nhistoric times Spain was conquered by the Carthaginians, who left few\r\ntraces of their occupation, by the Romans, who thoroughly Romanized the\r\ncountry, by the Visigoths, who founded a Germanic kingdom, and lastly by\r\nthe Moors, who introduced Arabian culture and the faith of Islam. [27]\r\nThese invaders were not numerous enough greatly to affect the population,\r\nin which the Celtiberian strain is still predominant.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN STATES OF SPAIN\r\n\r\nThe Moors never wholly conquered a fringe of mountain territory in the\r\nextreme north of Spain. Here a number of small Christian states, including\r\nLeón, Castile, Navarre, and Aragon, came into being. In the west there\r\nalso arose the Christian state of Portugal. Geographically, Portugal\r\nbelongs to Spain, from which it is separated only by artificial frontiers,\r\nbut the country has usually managed to maintain its independence.\r\n\r\nRECOVERY OF SPAIN FROM THE MOORS\r\n\r\nActing sometimes singly and sometimes in concert, the Christian states\r\nfought steadily to enlarge their boundaries at the expense of their Moslem\r\nneighbors. The contest had the nature of a crusade, for it was blessed by\r\nthe pope and supported by the chivalry of Europe. Periods of victory\r\nalternated with periods of defeat, but by the close of the thirteenth\r\ncentury Mohammedan Spain had been reduced to the kingdom of Granada at the\r\nsouthern extremity of the peninsula.\r\n\r\nTHE CID\r\n\r\nThe long struggle with the Moors made the Spanish a patriotic people,\r\nkeenly conscious of their national unity. The achievements of Christian\r\nwarriors were recited in countless ballads, and especially in the fine\r\n_Poem of the Cid_. It deals with the exploits of Rodrigo Diaz, better\r\nknown by the title of the Cid (lord) given to him by the Moors. The Cid of\r\nromance was the embodiment of every knightly virtue; the real Cid was a\r\nbandit, who fought sometimes for the Christians, sometimes against them,\r\nbut always in his own interest. The Cid's evil deeds were forgotten,\r\nhowever, and after his death in 1099 A.D. he became the national hero of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nUNION OF CASTILE AND ARAGON, 1479 A.D.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the separate Spanish kingdoms were coming together to form a\r\nnation. León and Castile in 1230 A.D. combined into the one kingdom of\r\nCastile, so named because its frontiers bristled with castles against the\r\nMoors. But the most important step in the making of Spain was the marriage\r\nof Ferdinand of Aragon to Isabella of Castile, leading in 1479 A.D. to the\r\nunion of these two kingdoms. About the same time the Castilian language\r\nbegan to crowd out the other Spanish dialects and to become the national\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, UNIFICATION OF SPAIN DURING THE MIDDLE AGES]\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF GRANADA, 1492 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe new sovereigns of Spain aimed to continue the unification of the\r\npeninsula by the conquest of Granada. No effort was made by the Turks, who\r\nshortly before had captured Constantinople, to defend this last stronghold\r\nof Islam in the West. The Moors, though thrown upon their own resources,\r\nmade a gallant resistance. At least once Ferdinand wearied of the\r\nstruggle, but Isabella's determination never wavered. In 1492 A.D. Granada\r\nsurrendered, and the silver cross of the crusading army was raised on the\r\nhighest tower of the city. Moslem rule in Spain, after an existence of\r\nalmost eight centuries, now came to an end.\r\n\r\nRULE OF FERDINAND AND ISABELLA\r\n\r\nFerdinand and Isabella belong in the front rank of European sovereigns.\r\nLike their contemporaries, Henry VII and Louis XI, they labored with\r\nsuccess to build up an absolute monarchy. Spain had found, as England and\r\nFrance had found, that feudalism spelled disorder, and that only a strong\r\ncentral government could keep the peace, repress crime, and foster trade\r\nand commerce. Ferdinand and Isabella firmly established the supremacy of\r\nthe crown. By the end of the fifteenth century Spain had become a leading\r\nEuropean power. Its importance in the councils of Europe was soon to be\r\nincreased by the marriage of a daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella to the\r\nheir of the Austrian house of Hapsburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n190. AUSTRIA AND THE SWISS CONFEDERATION, 1273-1499 A.D.\r\n\r\nRISE OF AUSTRIA\r\n\r\nThe name Austria--in German Oesterreich--means simply the eastern part of\r\nany kingdom. It came to be applied particularly to the territory on the\r\nDanube east of Bavaria, which Otto the Great had formed into a mark or\r\nborder province for defense against the Magyars. [28] This mark, soon to\r\nbe known as Austria, gained an important place among German states. The\r\nfrontiers were pushed down the Danube valley and the capital was finally\r\nlocated at Vienna, once a Roman city. Frederick Barbarossa raised Austria\r\nto the rank of a duchy. Rudolf of Hapsburg, who became emperor in 1273\r\nA.D., first brought the country into the hands of the Hapsburg family.\r\n[29]\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF AUSTRIA UNDER THE HAPSBURGS\r\n\r\nThe Hapsburgs founded the power of the present Austrian monarchy. At the\r\nend of the fourteenth century their dominions included a large part of\r\neastern Germany, [30] reaching from beyond the Danube southward to the\r\nAdriatic. Early in the sixteenth century they secured Bohemia, a Slavic\r\nland thrust like a wedge into German territory, as well as part of the\r\nMagyar land of Hungary. The possession of these two kingdoms gave Austria\r\nits special character of a state formed by the union under one ruler of\r\nseveral wholly distinct nations. Meanwhile the right of election as Holy\r\nRoman Emperor became hereditary in the Hapsburg family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, GROWTH OF THE HAPSBURG POSSESSIONS]\r\n\r\nSWITZERLAND\r\n\r\nSwitzerland, during the earlier period of the Middle Ages, formed a part\r\nof the German duchy of Swabia and belonged to the Holy Roman Empire. [31]\r\nAbout two-thirds of the population of Switzerland remain German in speech\r\nand feeling, though now the country includes districts in which French or\r\nItalian are spoken. All Swiss laws are still proclaimed in the three\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nSWITZERLAND AND AUSTRIA\r\n\r\nSwiss history is closely bound up with that of Austria. The little\r\nmountain communities of Schwyz, [32] Uri, and Unterwalden, on the shores\r\nof beautiful Lake Lucerne, were possessions of the counts of Hapsburg. In\r\n1291 A.D., the year when Rudolf of Hapsburg died, these three \"Forest\r\nCantons\" formed a confederation for resistance to their Hapsburg\r\noverlords. Additional cantons joined the league, which now entered upon a\r\nlong struggle, dear to all lovers of liberty, against Austrian rule.\r\nNowhere did the old methods of feudal warfare break down more\r\nconspicuously than in the battles gained by Swiss pikemen over the haughty\r\nknights of Austria. The struggle closed in 1499 A.D., when Switzerland\r\nbecame practically a free state. [33]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, THE SWISS CONFEDERATION, 1291-1513 A.D.]\r\n\r\nWILLIAM TELL AND ARNOLD VON WINKELRIED\r\n\r\nSwitzerland has two heroes of her war for independence. William Tell is a\r\nwholly mythical character, for the story of a skillful marksman who\r\nsucceeds in striking off some small object placed on a child's head is\r\nfound in England, Norway, Denmark, and other countries. The Swiss have\r\nlocalized it in Uri. Another popular hero has a better claim to historical\r\nexistence. It is said that at a critical moment in the battle of Sempach,\r\nwhen the Swiss with their short weapons failed to break the Austrian\r\nranks, Arnold von Winkelried, a man of Unterwalden, came to the rescue.\r\nRushing single-handed upon the enemy, he seized all the spears within\r\nreach and turned them into his own body. He thus opened a gap in the line,\r\nthrough which the Swiss pressed on to victory. Winkelried's deed might\r\nwell have been performed, though the evidence for it is very scanty.\r\n\r\nTHE SWISS CONFEDERATION\r\n\r\nLittle Switzerland, lying in the heart of the Alps and surrounded by\r\npowerful neighbors, is one of the most interesting states in Europe. The\r\ntwenty-two communities, or cantons, which make up the Swiss Confederation,\r\ndiffer among themselves in language, religion (Roman Catholic or\r\nProtestant), and customs, according to their nearness to Germany, France,\r\nor Italy. Nevertheless the Swiss form a patriotic and united nation. It is\r\nremarkable that a people whose chief bond of union was common hostility to\r\nthe Austrian Hapsburgs, should have established a federal government so\r\nstrong and enduring.\r\n\r\n\r\n191. EXPANSION OF GERMANY\r\n\r\nLINES OF GERMAN EXPANSION\r\n\r\nAn examination of the map shows how deficient Germany is in good natural\r\nboundaries. The valley of the Danube affords an easy road to the\r\nsoutheast, a road which the early rulers of Austria followed as far as\r\nVienna and the Hungarian frontier. Eastward along the Baltic no break\r\noccurs in the great plain stretching from the North Sea to the Ural\r\nMountains. It was in this direction that German conquests and colonization\r\nduring the Middle Ages laid the foundation of modern Prussia.\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN AND THE SLAV\r\n\r\nThe Germans, in descending upon the Roman Empire, had abandoned much of\r\ntheir former territories to the Slavs. In the reign of Charlemagne all the\r\nregion between the Elbe and the Vistula belonged to Slavic tribes. To win\r\nit back for Germany required several centuries of hard fighting. The Slavs\r\nwere heathen and barbarous, so that warfare with them seemed to be a kind\r\nof crusade. In the main, however, German expansion eastward was a business\r\nventure, due to the need for free land. It was the same need which in the\r\nnineteenth century carried the frontiers of the United States from the\r\nAlleghanies to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nBRANDENBURG AND POMERANIA\r\n\r\nGerman expansion began early in the tenth century, when Henry the Fowler\r\nannexed Brandenburg between the Elbe and the Oder. [34] Subsequently much\r\nof the territory between the Oder and the Vistula, including Pomerania on\r\nthe southern coast of the Baltic, came under German control. The Slavic\r\ninhabitants were exterminated or reduced to slavery. Their place was taken\r\nby thousands of German colonists, who introduced Christianity, built\r\nchurches and monasteries, cleared the woods, drained the marshes, and\r\nfounded many cities destined to become centers of German trade and\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nPRUSSIA\r\n\r\nBetween the Vistula and the Niemen lay the lands of the Prussians, a non-\r\nTeutonic people closely related to the Slavs. The Prussian language and\r\nreligion have disappeared, the Prussians themselves have been completely\r\nabsorbed by the Germans who settled in their country, but the Prussian\r\nname is borne to-day by one of the great states of modern Europe.\r\n\r\nTHE TEUTONIC ORDER\r\n\r\nThe conquest and conversion of the Prussians was accomplished by the\r\nfamous order of Teutonic Knights. It had been founded in Palestine as a\r\nmilitary-religious order, at the time of the Third Crusade. [35] The\r\ndecline of the crusading movement left the knights with no duties to\r\nperform, and so they transferred their activities to the Prussian\r\nfrontier, where there was still a chance to engage in a holy war.\r\nThroughout the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the Teutonic Order\r\nflourished, until its grand master ruled over the entire Baltic coast from\r\nthe Vistula to the gulf of Finland. The knights later had to relinquish\r\nmuch of this region to the Slavs, but they sowed there the seeds of\r\ncivilization. Russia's Baltic provinces [36] are to-day the richest and\r\nmost advanced in the empire.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL GERMANY\r\n\r\nGermany at the close of the Middle Ages was not a united, intensely\r\nnational state, such as had been established in England, France, and\r\nSpain. It had split into hundreds of principalities, none large, some\r\nextremely small, and all practically independent of the feeble German\r\nkings. [37] This weakness of the central power condemned Germany to a\r\nminor part in the affairs of Europe, as late as the nineteenth century.\r\nYet Germany found some compensation for political backwardness in the\r\nsplendid city life which it developed during the later Middle Ages. The\r\nGerman cities, together with those of Italy and other European lands, now\r\ncall for our attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, GERMAN EXPANSION EASTWARD DURING THE MIDDLE AGES]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

GROWTH OF THE CITIES\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIC REVIVAL\r\n\r\nCivilization has always had its home in the city. [1] The statement\r\napplies as well to medieval times as to the present day. Nothing marks\r\nmore strongly the backwardness of the early Middle Ages than the absence\r\nof large and flourishing cities throughout western Europe. The growth of\r\ntrade in the later Middle Ages led, however, to a civic revival beginning\r\nin the eleventh century. This change from rural to urban life was scarcely\r\nless significant for European history than the change from the feudal to\r\nthe national state.\r\n\r\nCITIES OF ROMAN ORIGIN\r\n\r\nA number of medieval cities stood on the sites, and even within the walls,\r\nof Roman municipalities. Particularly in Italy, southern France, and\r\nSpain, and also in the Rhine and Danube regions, it seems that some\r\nancient _municipia_ had never been entirely destroyed during the Germanic\r\ninvasions. They preserved their Roman names, their streets, aqueducts,\r\namphitheaters, and churches, and possibly vestiges of their Roman\r\ninstitutions. Among them were such important centers as Milan, Florence,\r\nVenice, Lyons, Marseilles, Paris, Vienna, Cologne, London, and York.\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE OTHER CITIES\r\n\r\nMany medieval cities were new foundations. Some rose to importance because\r\nof advantages of situation. A place where a river could be forded, where\r\ntwo roads met, or where a good harbor existed, would naturally become the\r\nresort of traders. Some, again, started as fortresses, behind whose\r\nramparts the peasants took refuge when danger threatened. A third group of\r\ncities developed from villages on the manors. A thriving settlement was\r\npretty sure to arise near a monastery or castle, which offered both\r\nprotection and employment to the common people.\r\n\r\nTHE CITY AND FEUDALISM\r\n\r\nThe city at first formed part of the feudal system. It grew upon the\r\nterritory of a feudal lord and naturally owed obedience to him. The\r\ncitizens ranked not much higher than serfs, though they were traders and\r\nartisans instead of farmers. They enjoyed no political rights, for their\r\nlord collected the taxes, appointed officials, kept order, and punished\r\noffenders. In short, the city was not free.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WALLS OF CARCASSONNE\r\nThe fortifications of Carcassonne an ancient city of southwestern France\r\nare probably unique in Europe for completeness and strength. They consist\r\nof a double line of ramparts protected by towers and pierced by only two\r\ngates. A part of the fortifications is attributed to the Visigoths in the\r\nsixth century, the remainder, including the castle, was raised during the\r\nMiddle Ages (eleventh to thirteenth centuries)]\r\n\r\nREVOLT OF THE CITIES\r\n\r\nBut the city from the first was the decided enemy of feudalism. [2] As its\r\ninhabitants increased in number and wealth, they became Revolt of\r\nconscious of their strength and refused to submit the cities to\r\noppression. Sometimes they won their freedom by hard fighting, more often\r\nthey purchased it, perhaps from some noble who needed money to go on a\r\ncrusade. In France, England, and Spain, where the royal power was strong,\r\nthe cities obtained exemption from their feudal burdens, but did not\r\nbecome entirely self-governing. In Germany and Italy, on the other hand,\r\nthe weakness of the central government permitted many cities to secure\r\ncomplete independence. They became true republics, like the old Greek\r\ncity-states. [3]\r\n\r\nCHARTERS\r\n\r\nThe contract which the citizens extorted from their lord was known as a\r\ncharter. It specified what taxes they should be required to pay and\r\nusually granted to them various privileges, such as those of holding\r\nassemblies, electing magistrates, and raising militia for local defense.\r\nThe revolt of the cities gradually extended over all western Europe, so\r\nthat at the end of the fourteenth century hardly any of them lacked a\r\ncharter.\r\n\r\nCIVIC FREEDOM\r\n\r\nThe free city had no room for either slaves or serfs. All servile\r\nconditions ceased inside its walls. The rule prevailed that anyone who had\r\nlived in a city for the term of a year and a day could no longer be\r\nclaimed by a lord as his serf. This rule found expression in the famous\r\nsaying: \"Town air renders free.\"\r\n\r\nRISE OF THE \"THIRD ESTATE\"\r\n\r\nThe freedom of the cities naturally attracted many immigrants to them.\r\nThere came into existence a middle class of city people, between the\r\nnobles and clergy on the one side and the peasants on the other side--what\r\nthe French call the _bourgeoisie._ [4] As we have [5] learned, the kings\r\nof England and France soon began to summon representatives of this middle\r\nclass to sit in assemblies as the \"third estate,\" by the side of the\r\nnobles and the clergy, who formed the first two estates. Henceforth the\r\nmiddle class, the _bourgeoisie,_ the \"third estate,\" distinguished as it\r\nwas for wealth, intelligence, and enterprise, exerted an ever-greater\r\ninfluence on European affairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n193. CITY LIFE\r\n\r\nA CITY FROM WITHOUT\r\n\r\nThe visitor approaching a medieval city through miles of open fields saw\r\nit clear in the sunlight, unobscured by coal smoke. From without it looked\r\nlike a fortress, with walls, towers, gateways, drawbridges, and moat.\r\nBeyond the fortifications he would see, huddled together against the sky,\r\nthe spires of the churches and the cathedral, the roofs of the larger\r\nhouses, and the dark, frowning mass of the castle. The general impression\r\nwould be one of wealth and strength and beauty.\r\n\r\nA CITY FROM WITHIN\r\n\r\nOnce within the walls the visitor would not find things so attractive. The\r\nstreets were narrow, crooked, and ill-paved, dark during the day because\r\nof the overhanging houses, and without illumination at night. There were\r\nno open spaces or parks except a small market place. The whole city was\r\ncramped by its walls, which shut out light, air, and view, and prevented\r\nexpansion into the neighboring country. Medieval London, for instance,\r\ncovered an area of less than one square mile. [6]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SCENE IN ROTHENBURG]\r\n\r\nUNSANITARY CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nA city in the Middle Ages lacked all sanitary arrangements. The only water\r\nsupply came from polluted streams and wells. There were no sewers and no\r\nsidewalks. People piled up their refuse in the backyard or flung it into\r\nthe street, to be devoured by the dogs and pigs which served as\r\nscavengers. The holes in the pavement collected all manner of filth, and\r\nthe unpaved lanes, in wet weather, became deep pits of mud. We can\r\nunderstand why the townspeople wore overshoes when they went out, and why\r\neven the saints in the pictures were represented with them on. The living\r\nwere crowded together in many-storied houses, airless and gloomy; the dead\r\nwere buried close at hand in crowded churchyards. Such unsanitary\r\nconditions must have been responsible for much of the sickness that was\r\nprevalent. The high death rate could only be offset by a birth rate\r\ncorrespondingly high, and by the constant influx of country people.\r\n\r\nCIVIC REGULATIONS\r\n\r\nNumerous petty regulations restricted the private life of the townspeople.\r\nThe municipal authorities sometimes decided how many guests might be\r\ninvited to weddings, how much might be spent on wedding presents, what\r\ndifferent garments might be owned and worn by a citizen, and even the\r\nnumber of trees that might be planted in his garden. Each citizen had to\r\nserve his turn as watchman on the walls or in the streets at night. When\r\nthe great bell in the belfry rang the \"curfew,\" [7] at eight or nine\r\no'clock, this was the signal for every one to extinguish lights and fires\r\nand go to bed. It was a useful precaution, since conflagrations were\r\ncommon enough in the densely packed wooden houses. After curfew the\r\nstreets became deserted, except for the night watch making their rounds\r\nand the presence of occasional pedestrians carrying lanterns. The\r\nmunicipal government spent little or nothing on police protection, so that\r\nstreet brawls, and even robbery and murder, were not infrequent.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC BUILDINGS\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the city took a just pride in their public buildings.\r\nThe market place, where traders assembled, often contained a beautiful\r\ncross and sometimes a market hall to shelter goods from the weather. Not\r\nfar away rose the city hall, [8] for the transaction of public business\r\nand the holding of civic feasts. The hall might be crowned by a high\r\nbelfry with an alarm bell to summon citizens to mass meeting. Then there\r\nwould be a number of churches and abbeys and, if the city was the capital\r\nof a bishop's diocese, an imposing cathedral.\r\n\r\nMUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThe small size of medieval cities--few included as many as ten thousand\r\ninhabitants--simplified the problem of governing them. The leading\r\nmerchants usually formed a council presided over by a head magistrate, the\r\nburgomaster [9] or mayor, [10] who was assisted by aldermen. [11] In some\r\nplaces the guilds chose the officials and managed civic affairs. These\r\nassociations had many functions and held a most important place in city\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n194. CIVIC INDUSTRY: THE GUILDS\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF GUILDS\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxon word \"guild,\" which means \"to pay,\" came to be applied to\r\na club or society whose members made contributions for some common\r\npurpose. This form Of association is very old. Some of the guilds in\r\nimperial Rome had been established in the age of the kings, while not a\r\nfew of those which flourish to-day in China and India were founded before\r\nthe Christian era. Guilds existed in Continental Europe as early as the\r\ntime of Charlemagne, but they did not become prominent till after the\r\ncrusades.\r\n\r\nMERCHANT GUILDS\r\n\r\nA guild of merchants grew up when those who bought and sold goods in any\r\nplace united to protect their own interests. The membership included many\r\nartisans, as well as professional traders, for in medieval times a man\r\noften sold in the front room of his shop the goods which he made in the\r\nback rooms. He was often both shopkeeper and workman in one.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL MONOPOLY\r\n\r\nThe chief duty of a merchant guild was to preserve to its own members the\r\nmonopoly of trade within a town. Strangers and non-guildsmen could not buy\r\nor sell there except under the conditions imposed by the guild. They must\r\npay the town tolls, confine their dealings to guildsmen, and as a rule\r\nsell only at wholesale. They were forbidden to purchase wares which the\r\ntownspeople wanted for themselves or to set up shops for retail trade.\r\nThey enjoyed more freedom at fairs, which were intended to attract\r\noutsiders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE OF THE BUTCHERS' GUILD, HILDESHEIM, GERMANY\r\nHildesheim, near Hanover, is perhaps the richest of all German towns in\r\nfine wooden-framed houses. The house of the Butchers' Guild has recently\r\nbeen restored, with all its original coloring carefully reproduced.]\r\n\r\nCRAFT GUILDS\r\n\r\nAfter a time the traders and artisans engaged in a particular occupation\r\nbegan to form an association of their own. Thus arose the craft guilds,\r\ncomposed of weavers, shoemakers, bakers, tailors, carpenters, and so on,\r\nuntil almost every form of industry had its separate organization. The\r\nnames of the various occupations came to be used as the surnames of those\r\nengaged in them, so that to-day we have such common family names as Smith,\r\nCooper, Fuller, Potter, Chandler, and many others. The number of craft\r\nguilds in an important city might be very large. London and Paris at one\r\ntime each had more than one hundred, and Cologne in Germany had as many as\r\neighty. The members of a particular guild usually lived in the same street\r\nor quarter of the city, not only for companionship but also for better\r\nsupervision of their labor. [12]\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL MONOPOLY\r\n\r\nJust as the merchant guild regulated town trade, so the craft guilds had\r\ncharge of town industry. No one could engage in any craft without becoming\r\na member of the guild which controlled it and submitting to the guild\r\nregulations. A man's hours of labor and the prices at which he sold his\r\ngoods were fixed for him by the guild. He might not work elsewhere than in\r\nhis shop, because of the difficulty of supervising him, nor might he work\r\nby artificial light, lest he turn out badly finished goods. Everything\r\nmade by him was carefully inspected to see if it contained shoddy\r\nmaterials or showed poor workmanship. Failure to meet the test meant a\r\nheavy fine or perhaps expulsion from the guild. Thus the industrial\r\nmonopoly possessed by the craft guild gave some protection to both\r\nproducer and consumer.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF CRAFT GUILDS\r\n\r\nFull membership in a guild was reached only by degrees. A boy started as\r\nan apprentice, that is, a learner. He paid a sum of money to his master\r\nand agreed to serve him for a fixed period, usually seven years. The\r\nmaster, in turn, promised to provide the apprentice with food, lodging,\r\nand clothing, and to teach him all the secrets of the craft. At the end of\r\nthe seven years the apprentice had to pass an examination by the guild. If\r\nhe was found fit, he then became a journeyman and worked for daily wages.\r\nAs soon as he had saved enough money, he might set up as a master in his\r\nown shop. A master was at once workman and employer, laborer and\r\ncapitalist.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES OF CRAFT GUILDS\r\n\r\nLike the old Roman guilds, those of the Middle Ages had their charitable\r\nand religious aspects. Each guild raised large benefit funds for the\r\nrelief of members or their widows and orphans. Each guild had its private\r\naltar in the cathedral, or often its own chapel, where masses were said\r\nfor the repose of the souls of deceased members, and where on the day of\r\nits patron saint religious services were held. The guild was also a social\r\norganization, with frequent meetings for a feast in its hall or in some\r\ninn. The guilds in some cities entertained the people with an annual play\r\nor procession. [13] It is clear that the members of a medieval craft guild\r\nhad common interests and shared a common life.\r\n\r\nDISSOLUTION OF CRAFT GUILDS\r\n As the craft guilds prospered and increased in wealth, they tended to\r\nbecome exclusive organizations. Membership fees were raised so high that\r\nfew could afford to pay them, while the number of apprentices that a\r\nmaster might take was strictly limited. It also became increasingly\r\ndifficult for journeymen to rise to the station of masters; they often\r\nremained wage-earners for life. The mass of workmen could no longer\r\nparticipate in the benefits of the guild system. In the eighteenth century\r\nmost of the guilds lost their monopoly of industry, and in the nineteenth\r\ncentury they gave way to trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n195. TRADE AND COMMERCE\r\n\r\nMARKETS\r\n\r\nNearly every town of any consequence had a weekly or semiweekly market,\r\nwhich was held in the market place or in the churchyard. Marketing often\r\noccurred on Sunday, in spite of many laws against this desecration of the\r\nday. Outsiders who brought cattle and farm produce for sale in the market\r\nwere required to pay tolls, either to the town authorities or sometimes to\r\na neighboring nobleman. These market dues still survive in the \"octroi\"\r\ncollected at the gates of some European cities.\r\n\r\n\"JUST PRICE\"\r\n\r\nPeople in the Middle Ages did not believe in unrestricted competition. It\r\nwas thought wrong for anyone to purchase goods outside of the regular\r\nmarket (\"forestalling\") or to purchase them in larger quantities than\r\nnecessary (\"engrossing\"). A man ought not to charge for a thing more than\r\nit was worth, or to buy a thing cheap and sell it dear. The idea prevailed\r\nthat goods should be sold at their \"just price\" which was not determined\r\nby supply and demand but by an estimate of the cost of the materials and\r\nthe labor that went into their manufacture. Laws were often passed fixing\r\nthis \"just price,\" but it was as difficult then as now to prevent the\r\n\"cornering of the market\" by shrewd and unscrupulous traders.\r\n\r\nFAIRS\r\n\r\nBesides markets at frequent intervals, many towns held fairs once or twice\r\na year. The fairs often lasted for a month or more. They were especially\r\nnecessary in medieval Europe, because merchants did not keep large\r\nquantities or many kinds of goods on their shelves, nor could intending\r\npurchasers afford to travel far in search of what they wanted. The more\r\nimportant English fairs included those at Stourbridge near Cambridge,\r\nWinchester, St. Ives, and Boston. On the Continent fairs were numerous and\r\nin some places, such as Leipzig in Germany and Nijni-Novgorod in Russia,\r\nthey are still kept up.\r\n\r\nFAIRS AND COMMERCE\r\n\r\nA fair gave opportunity for the sale of commodities brought from the most\r\ndistant regions. Stourbridge Fair, for instance, attracted Venetians and\r\nGenoese with silk, pepper, and spices of the East, Flemings with fine\r\ncloths and linens, Spaniards with iron and wine, Norwegians with tar and\r\npitch from their forests, and Baltic merchants with furs, amber, and\r\nsalted fish. The fairs, by fostering commerce, helped to make the various\r\nEuropean peoples better acquainted with one another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, TRADE ROUTES BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN EUROPE IN\r\nTHE 13TH AND 14TH CENTURIES]\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF COMMERCE IN THE MIDDLE AGES\r\n\r\nCommerce in western Europe had almost disappeared as a result of the\r\nGermanic invasions and the establishment of feudalism. What little\r\ncommercial intercourse there was encountered many obstacles. A merchant\r\nwho went by land from country to country might expect to find bad roads,\r\nfew bridges, and poor inns. Goods were transported on pack-horses instead\r\nof in wagons. Highway robbery was so common that travelers always carried\r\narms and often united in bands for better protection. The feudal lords,\r\noften themselves not much more than highwaymen, demanded tolls at every\r\nbridge and ford and on every road. If the merchant proceeded by water, he\r\nmust face, in addition to the ordinary hazards of wind and wave, the\r\ndanger from the ill-lighted coasts and from attacks by pirates. No wonder\r\ncommerce languished in the early Middle Ages and for a long time lay\r\nchiefly in the hands of Byzantines [14] and Arabs. [15]\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL REVIVAL AFTER THE CRUSADES\r\n\r\nEven during the dark centuries that followed the end of the Roman Empire,\r\nsome trade with the Orient had been carried on by the cities of Italy and\r\nsouthern France. The crusades, which brought East and West face to face,\r\ngreatly increased this trade. The Mediterranean lands first felt the\r\nstimulating effects of intercourse with the Orient, but before long the\r\ncommercial revival extended to the rest of Europe.\r\n\r\nASIATIC TRADE ROUTES\r\n\r\nBefore the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope the spices, drugs, incense,\r\ncarpets, tapestries, porcelains, and gems of India, China, and the East\r\nIndies reached the West by three main routes. All had been used in ancient\r\ntimes. [16] The central and most important route led up the Persian Gulf\r\nand Tigris River to Bagdad, from which city goods went by caravan to\r\nAntioch or Damascus. The southern route reached Cairo and Alexandria by\r\nway of the Red Sea and the Nile. By taking advantage of the monsoons, a\r\nmerchant ship could make the voyage from India to Egypt in about three\r\nmonths. The northern route, entirely overland, led to ports on the Black\r\nSea and thence to Constantinople. It traversed high mountain passes and\r\nlong stretches of desert, and could profitably be used only for the\r\ntransport of valuable articles small in bulk. The conquests of the Ottoman\r\nTurks greatly interfered with the use of this route by Christians after\r\nthe middle of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN TRADE ROUTES\r\n\r\nOriental goods, upon reaching the Mediterranean, could be transported by\r\nwater to northern Europe. Every year the Venetians sent a fleet loaded\r\nwith eastern products to Bruges in Flanders, a city which was the most\r\nimportant depot of trade with Germany, England, and Scandinavia. Bruges\r\nalso formed the terminus of the main overland route leading from Venice\r\nover the Alps and down the Rhine. But as the map indicates, many other\r\ncommercial highways linked the Mediterranean with the North Sea and the\r\nBaltic.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL RELATIONS\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that until late in the Middle Ages trade existed,\r\nnot between nations, but between cities. A merchant of London was almost\r\nas much a foreigner in any other English city as he would have been in\r\nBruges, Paris, or Cologne. Consequently, each city needed to make\r\ncommercial treaties with its neighbors, stipulating what were the\r\nprivileges and obligations of its merchants, wherever they went. It was\r\nnot until the kings grew strong in western Europe that merchants could\r\nrely on the central government, rather than on local authorities, for\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, MEDIEVAL TRADE ROUTES\r\n  Land Routes\r\n  Water Routes\r\n  Marco Polo's Route]\r\n\r\n\r\n196. MONEY AND BANKING\r\n\r\nSMALL SCALE OF BUSINESS ENTERPRISE\r\n\r\nWe have seen that business in the Middle Ages was chiefly of a retail\r\ncharacter and was conducted in markets and fairs. The artisan who\r\nmanufactured the goods he sold and the peddler who carried his goods about\r\nfrom place to place were the leading types of medieval traders. Little\r\nwholesale business existed, and the merchant prince who owned warehouses\r\nand large stocks of goods was an exceptional figure.\r\n\r\nLACK OF MONEY\r\n\r\nOne reason for the small scale of business enterprise is found in the\r\ninadequate supply of money. From the beginning of the Christian era to the\r\ntwelfth century there seems to have been a steady decrease in the amount\r\nof specie in circulation, partly because so much moved to the Orient in\r\npayment for luxuries, and partly because the few mines in western Europe\r\nwent out of use during the period of the invasions. The scarcity of money,\r\nas has been shown, [17] helped directly to build up the feudal system,\r\nsince salaries, wages, and rents could be paid only in personal services\r\nor in produce. The money supply increased during the latter part of the\r\nMiddle Ages, but it did not become sufficient for the needs of business\r\ntill the discovery of the New World enabled the Spaniards to tap the\r\nwealth of the silver mines in Mexico and Peru. [18]\r\n\r\nFAULTS OF MEDIEVAL CURRENCY\r\n\r\nMedieval currency was not only small in amount but also faulty in\r\ncharacter. Many great nobles enjoyed the privilege of keeping a mint and\r\nissuing coins. Since this feudal money passed at its full value only in\r\nthe locality where it was minted, a merchant had to be constantly changing\r\nhis money, as he went from one fief to another, and always at a loss.\r\nKings and nobles for their own profit would often debase the currency by\r\nputting silver into the gold coins and copper into the silver coins. Every\r\ndebasement, as it left the coins with less pure metal, lowered their\r\npurchasing power and so raised prices unexpectedly. Even in countries like\r\nEngland, where debasement was exceptional, much counterfeit money\r\ncirculated, to the constant impediment of trade.\r\n\r\n\"USURY\" LAWS\r\n\r\nThe prejudice against \"usury,\" as any lending of money at interest was\r\ncalled, made another hindrance to business enterprise. It seemed wrong for\r\na person to receive interest, since he lost nothing by the loan of his\r\nmoney. Numerous Church laws condemned the receipt of interest as\r\nunchristian. If, however, the lender could show that he had suffered any\r\nloss, or had been prevented from making any gain, through not having his\r\nmoney, he might charge something for its use. In time people began to\r\ndistinguish between interest moderate in amount and an excessive charge\r\nfor the use of money. The latter alone was henceforth prohibited as\r\nusurious. Most modern states still have usury laws which fix the legal\r\nrate of interest.\r\n\r\nTHE JEWS AS MONEY LENDERS\r\n\r\nThe business of money lending, denied to Christians, fell into the hands\r\nof the Jews. In nearly all European countries popular prejudice forbade\r\nthe Jews to engage in agriculture, while the guild regulations barred them\r\nfrom industry. They turned to trade and finance for a livelihood and\r\nbecame the chief capitalists of medieval times. But the law gave the Jews\r\nno protection, and kings and nobles constantly extorted large sums from\r\nthem. The persecutions of the Jews date from the era of the crusades, when\r\nit was as easy to excite fanatical hatred against them as against the\r\nMoslems. Edward I drove the Jews from England and Ferdinand and Isabella\r\nexpelled them from Spain. They are still excluded from the Spanish\r\npeninsula, and in Russia and Austria they are not granted all the\r\nprivileges which Christians enjoy.\r\n\r\nITALIAN BANKING\r\n\r\nThe Jews were least persecuted in the commercial cities of northern Italy.\r\nFlorence, Genoa, and Venice in the thirteenth century were the money\r\ncenters of Europe. The banking companies in these cities received deposits\r\nand then loaned the money to foreign governments and great nobles. It was\r\nthe Florentine bankers, for instance, who provided the English king,\r\nEdward III, with the funds to carry on his wars against France. The\r\nItalian banking houses had branches in the principal cities of Europe.\r\n[19] It became possible, therefore, to introduce the use of bills of\r\nexchange as a means of balancing debts between countries, without the\r\nnecessity of sending the actual money. This system of international credit\r\nwas doubly important at a time when so many risks attended the\r\ntransportation of the precious metals. Another Florentine invention was\r\nbookkeeping by double-entry. [20]\r\n\r\n\r\n197. ITALIAN CITIES\r\n\r\nTHE CITY REPUBLICS\r\n\r\nThe cities of northern Italy owed their prosperity, as we have learned, to\r\nthe commerce with the Orient. It was this which gave them the means and\r\nthe strength to keep up a long struggle for freedom against the German\r\nemperors.[21] The end of the struggle, at the middle of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, saw all North Italy divided into the dominions of various\r\nindependent cities. Among them were Milan, Pisa, Florence, Genoa, and\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\nMILAN\r\n\r\nMilan, a city of Roman origin, lay in the fertile valley of the Po, at a\r\npoint where the trade routes through several Alpine passes converged.\r\nMilan early rose to importance, and it still remains the commercial\r\nmetropolis of Italy. Manufacturing also flourished there. Milanese armor\r\nwas once celebrated throughout Europe. The city is rich in works of art,\r\nthe best known being the cathedral, which, after St. Peter's at Rome and\r\nthe cathedral of Seville, is the largest church in Europe. Though the\r\nMilanese were able to throw off the imperial authority, their government\r\nfell into the hands of the local nobles, who ruled as despots. Almost all\r\nthe Italian cities, except Venice, lost their freedom in this manner.\r\n\r\nPISA\r\n\r\nPisa, like Milan, was an old Roman city which profited by the disorders of\r\nthe barbarian invasions to assert its independence. The situation of Pisa\r\non the Arno River, seven miles from the sea, made it a maritime state, and\r\nthe Pisan navy gained distinction in warfare against the Moslems in the\r\nMediterranean. The Pisans joined in the First Crusade and showed their\r\nvalor at the capture of Jerusalem. They profited greatly by the crusading\r\nmovement and soon possessed banks, warehouses, and trading privileges in\r\nevery eastern port. But Pisa had bitter rivals in Florence and Genoa, and\r\nthe conflicts with these two cities finally brought about the destruction\r\nof its power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAPTISTERY, CATHEDRAL, AND \"LEANING TOWER\" OF PISA\r\nThese three buildings in the piazza of Pisa form one of the most\r\ninteresting architectural groups in Italy. The baptistery, completed in\r\n1278 A.D., is a circular structure, 100 feet in diameter and covered with\r\na high dome. The cathedral was consecrated in 1118 A.D. The finest part of\r\nthe building is the west front with its four open arcades. The campanile,\r\nor bell tower, reaches a height of 179 feet. Owing to the sinking of the\r\nfoundations, it leans from the perpendicular to a striking extent (now\r\nabout 161/2 feet).]\r\n\r\nFLORENCE\r\n\r\nFlorence, Pisa's neighbor on the Arno, was renowned for manufactures. The\r\nfine wool, silk cloths, golden brocades, jewelry, and metal work of\r\nFlorence were imported into all European countries. The craft guilds were\r\nvery strong there, and even the neighboring nobles, who wished to become\r\ncitizens, had first to enroll themselves in some guild. It was from\r\nbanking, however, that Florence gained most wealth. In the fifteenth\r\ncentury the city contained eighty great banking houses, in addition to\r\nnumerous branches outside of Italy. With their commercial spirit the\r\nFlorentines combined a remarkable taste for art and literature. Their\r\ncity, whose population never exceeded seventy thousand, gave birth to some\r\nof the most illustrious poets, prose writers, architects, sculptors, and\r\npainters of medieval times. It was the Athens of Italy. [22]\r\n\r\nGENOA\r\n\r\nGenoa, located on the gulf of the same name, possessed a safe and spacious\r\nharbor. During the era of the crusades the city carried on a flourishing\r\ntrade in both the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. After the fall of the\r\nLatin Empire of Constantinople [23] the Genoese almost monopolized\r\nOriental commerce along the Black Sea route. The closing of this route by\r\nthe Ottoman Turks was a heavy blow to their prosperity, which also\r\nsuffered from the active competition of Venice.\r\n\r\nSITUATION OF VENICE\r\n\r\nAlmost alone among Italian cities Venice was not of Roman origin. Its\r\nbeginning is traced back to the period of barbarian inroads, when\r\nfugitives from the mainland sought a new home on the islands at the head\r\nof the Adriatic. [24] These islands, which lie about five miles from the\r\ncoast, are protected from the outer sea by a long sand bar. They are\r\nlittle more than mud-banks, barely rising above the shallow water of the\r\nlagoons. The oozy soil afforded no support for buildings, except when\r\nstrengthened by piles; there was scarcely any land fit for farming or\r\ncattle-raising; and the only drinking water had to be stored from the\r\nrainfall. Yet on this unpromising site arose one of the most splendid of\r\nEuropean cities.\r\n\r\nVENETIAN COMMERCE\r\n\r\nThe early inhabitants of Venice got their living from the sale of sea salt\r\nand fish, two commodities for which a constant demand existed in the\r\nMiddle Ages. Large quantities of salt were needed for preserving meat in\r\nthe winter months, while fish was eaten by all Christians on the numerous\r\nfast days and in Lent. The Venetians exchanged these commodities for the\r\nproductions of the mainland and so built up a thriving trade. From\r\nfishermen they became merchants, with commercial relations which gradually\r\nextended to the Orient. The crusades vastly increased the wealth of\r\nVenice, for she provided the ships in which troops and supplies went to\r\nthe Holy Land and she secured the largest share of the new eastern trade.\r\nVenice became the great emporium of the Mediterranean. As a commercial\r\ncenter the city was the successor of ancient Tyre, Carthage, Athens, and\r\nAlexandria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VENICE AND THE GRAND CANAL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAMPANILE AND DOGE'S PALACE, VENICE\r\nThe famous Campanile or bell tower of St. Mark's Cathedral collapsed in\r\n1902 A.D. A new tower, faithfully copying the old monument, was completed\r\nnine years later. The Doge's Palace, a magnificent structure of brick and\r\nmarble, is especially remarkable for the graceful arched colonnades\r\nforming the two lower stories. The blank walls of the upper story are\r\nbroken by a few large and richly ornamented windows.]\r\n\r\nVENETIAN POSSESSIONS\r\n\r\nVenice also used the crusading movement for her political advantage. The\r\ncapture of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade extended Venetian control\r\nover the Peloponnesus, [25] Crete, Rhodes, Cyprus, and many smaller\r\nislands in the eastern Mediterranean. Even before this time Venice had\r\nbegun to gain possessions upon the Italian mainland and along the Adriatic\r\ncoast. At the height of her power about 1400 A.D. she ruled a real empire.\r\n[26]\r\n\r\nVENETIAN SEA POWER\r\n\r\nThe commerce and possessions of Venice made it necessary for her to\r\nmaintain a powerful fleet. She is said to have had at one time over three\r\nthousand merchant vessels, besides forty-five war galleys. Her ships went\r\nout in squadrons, with men-of-war acting as a convoy against pirates. One\r\nfleet traded with the ports of western Europe, another proceeded to the\r\nBlack Sea, while others visited Syria and Egypt to meet the caravans from\r\nthe Far East. Venetian sea power humbled Genoa and for a long time held\r\nthe Mediterranean against the Ottoman Turks.\r\n\r\nTHE \"QUEEN OF THE ADRIATIC\"\r\n\r\nThe greatness of Venice was celebrated by the annual ceremony of \"the\r\nwedding of the sea.\" The doge, (that is, \"duke.\") or chief magistrate,\r\nstanding in the bows of the state barge, cast a ring of gold into the\r\nAdriatic with the proud words, \"We have wedded thee, O sea, in token of\r\nour rightful and perpetual dominion.\"\r\n\r\nVENICE DESCRIBED\r\n\r\nThe visitor to modern Venice can still gain a good impression of what the\r\ncity must have looked like in the fourteenth century, when ships of every\r\nnation crowded its quays and strangers of every country thronged its\r\nsquares or sped in light gondolas over the canals which take the place of\r\nstreets. The main highway is still the Grand Canal, nearly two miles long\r\nand lined with palaces and churches. The Grand Canal leads to St. Mark's\r\nCathedral, brilliant with mosaic pictures, the Campanile, or bell tower,\r\nand the Doge's Palace. The \"Bridge of Sighs\" connects the ducal palace\r\nwith the state prisons. The Rialto in the business heart of Venice is\r\nanother famous bridge. But these are only a few of the historic and\r\nbeautiful buildings of the island city.\r\n\r\n\r\n198. GERMAN CITIES: THE HANSEATIC LEAGUE\r\n\r\nCITIES OF SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL GERMANY\r\n\r\nThe important trade routes from Venice and Genoa through the Alpine passes\r\ninto the valleys of the Rhine and Danube were responsible for the\r\nprosperity of many fine cities in southern and central Germany. Among them\r\nwere Augsburg, which rivaled Florence as a financial center, Nuremberg,\r\nfamous for artistic metal work, Ulm, Strassburg, and Cologne. The feeble\r\nrule of the German kings compelled the cities to form several\r\nconfederacies for the purpose of resisting the extortionate tolls and\r\ndownright robberies of feudal lords.\r\n\r\nCITIES OF NORTHERN GERMANY\r\n\r\nIt was the Baltic commerce which brought the cities of northern Germany\r\ninto a firm union. From the Baltic region came large quantities of dried\r\nand salted fish, especially herring, wax candles for church services,\r\nskins, tallow, and lumber. Furs were also in great demand. Every one wore\r\nthem during the winter, on account of the poorly heated houses. The German\r\ncities which shared in this commerce early formed the celebrated Hanseatic\r\n[27] League for protection against pirates and feudal lords.\r\n\r\nMEMBERSHIP OF THE HANSEATIC LEAGUE\r\n\r\nThe league seems to have begun with an alliance of Hamburg and Lübeck to\r\nsafeguard the traffic on the Elbe. The growth of the league was rapid. At\r\nthe period of its greatest power, about 1400 A.D., there were upwards of\r\neighty Hanseatic cities along the Baltic coast and in the inland districts\r\nof northern Germany.\r\n\r\nHANSEATIC \"FACTORIES\"\r\n\r\nThe commercial importance of the league extended far beyond the borders of\r\nGermany. Its trading posts, or \"factories,\" at Bergen in Norway and\r\nNovgorod in Russia controlled the export trade of those two countries.\r\nSimilar establishments existed at London, on the Thames just above London\r\nBridge, and at Bruges in Flanders. Each factory served as a fortress where\r\nmerchants could be safe from attack, as a storehouse for goods, and as a\r\ngeneral market.\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE HANSEATIC LEAGUE\r\n\r\nThe Hanseatic League ruled over the Baltic Sea very much as Venice ruled\r\nover the Adriatic. In spite of its monopolistic tendencies, so opposed to\r\nthe spirit of free intercourse between nations, the league did much useful\r\nwork by suppressing piracy and by encouraging the art of navigation.\r\nModern Germans look back to it as proof that their country can play a\r\ngreat part on the seas. The Hanseatic merchants were also pioneers in the\r\nhalf-barbarous lands of northern and eastern Europe, where they founded\r\ntowns, fostered industry, and introduced comforts and luxuries previously\r\nunknown. Such services in advancing civilization were comparable to those\r\nperformed by the Teutonic Knights. [28]\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF THE HANSEATIC LEAGUE\r\n\r\nAfter several centuries of usefulness the league lost its monopoly of the\r\nBaltic trade and began to decline. Moreover the Baltic, like the\r\nMediterranean, sank to minor importance as a commercial center, after the\r\nPortuguese had discovered the sea route to India and the Spaniards had\r\nopened up the New World. [29] City after city gradually withdrew from the\r\nleague, till only Hamburg, Lübeck, and Bremen remained. They are still\r\ncalled free and independent cities, though now they form a part of the\r\nGerman Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n199. THE CITIES OF FLANDERS\r\n\r\nCOUNTY OF FLANDERS\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages the Netherlands, or \"Low Countries,\" now divided\r\nbetween Holland and Belgium, consisted of a number of feudal states,\r\nnominally under the control of German and French kings, but really quite\r\nindependent. Among them was the county of Flanders. It included the coast\r\nregion from Calais to the mouth of the Scheldt, as well as a considerable\r\ndistrict in what is now northwestern France. The inhabitants of Flanders\r\nwere partly of Teutonic extraction (the Flemings) and partly akin to the\r\nFrench (the Walloons).\r\n\r\nFLANDERS AS A COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CENTER\r\n\r\nFlanders enjoyed a good situation for commerce. The country formed a\r\nconvenient stopping place for merchants who went by sea between the\r\nMediterranean and the Baltic, while important land routes led thither from\r\nall parts of western Europe. Flanders was also an industrial center. Its\r\nmiddle classes early discovered the fact that by devotion to manufacturing\r\neven a small and sterile region may become rich and populous.\r\n\r\nFLEMISH WOOL TRADE\r\n\r\nThe leading industry of Flanders was weaving. England in the Middle Ages\r\nraised great flocks of sheep, but lacking skilled workmen to manufacture\r\nthe wool into fine cloth, sent it across the Channel to Flanders. A\r\nmedieval writer declared that the whole world was clothed in English wool\r\nmanufactured by the Flemings. The taxes that were laid on the export of\r\nwool helped to pay the expenses of English kings in their wars with the\r\nWelsh, the Scotch, and the Irish. The wool trade also made Flanders the\r\nally of England in the Hundred Years' War, thus beginning that historic\r\nfriendship between the two countries which still endures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BELFRY OF BRUGES\r\nBruges, the capital of West Flanders, contains many fine monuments of the\r\nMiddle Ages Among these is the belfry, which rises in the center of the\r\nfaçade of the market hall. It dates from the end of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. Its height is 352 feet. The belfry consists of three stories, the\r\ntwo lower ones square, and the upper one, octagonal.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOWN HALL OF LOUVAIN, BELGIUM\r\nOne of the richest and most ornate examples of Gothic architecture Erected\r\nin the fifteenth century The building consists of three stories above\r\nwhich rises the lofty roof crowned with graceful towers. The interior\r\ndecoration and arrangements are commonplace.]\r\n\r\nBRUGES, GHENT AND YPRES\r\n\r\nAmong the thriving communities of Flanders three held an exceptional\r\nposition. Bruges was the mart where the trade of southern Europe, in the\r\nhands of the Venetians, and the trade of northern Europe, in the hands of\r\nthe Hanseatic merchants, came together. Ghent, with forty thousand\r\nworkshops, and Ypres, which counted two hundred thousand workmen within\r\nits walls and suburbs, were scarcely less prosperous. When these cities\r\ndeclined in wealth, Antwerp became the commercial metropolis of the\r\nNetherlands.\r\n\r\nFLANDERS AND FRANCE\r\n\r\nDuring the fourteenth century Flanders was annexed by France. The Flemish\r\ncities resisted bravely, and on more than one occasion their citizen\r\nlevies, who could handle sword and ax, as well as the loom, defeated the\r\nFrench armies, thus demonstrating again that foot soldiers were a match\r\nfor mailed cavalry. Had the cities been able to form a lasting league,\r\nthey might have established an independent Flanders, but the bitter\r\nrivalry of Ghent and Bruges led to foreign domination, lasting into the\r\nnineteenth century. [30]\r\n\r\nTHE CITIES AND CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nThe great cities of Flanders, Germany, and Italy, not to speak of those in\r\nFrance, Spain, and England, were much more than centers of trade,\r\nindustry, and finance. Within their walls learning and art flourished to\r\nan extent which had never been possible in earlier times, when rural life\r\nprevailed throughout western Europe. We shall now see what the cities of\r\nthe Middle Ages contributed to civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

FORMATION OF NATIONAL LANGUAGES\r\n\r\nTHE 12TH AND 13TH CENTURIES\r\n\r\nThe twelfth and thirteenth centuries, which in western Europe saw the rise\r\nof national states out of the chaos of feudalism and the development of\r\ncities, may be regarded as the central period of the Middle Ages. During\r\nthis time there flourished a civilization which is properly described as\r\n\"medieval,\" to distinguish it from classical civilization on the one side\r\nand modern civilization on the other side. The various European languages\r\nthen began to assume something like their present form. A large body of\r\nliterature, in both poetry and prose, appeared. Architecture revived, and\r\nflowered in majestic cathedrals. Education also revived, especially in the\r\nuniversities with their thousands of students. These and other aspects of\r\nmedieval life will now engage our attention.\r\n\r\nLATIN AS AN INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE\r\n\r\nThroughout the Middle Ages Latin continued to be an international\r\nlanguage. The Roman Church used it for papal bulls and other documents.\r\nPrayers were recited, hymns were sung, and sometimes sermons were preached\r\nin Latin. It was also the language of men of culture everywhere in western\r\nChristendom. University professors lectured in Latin, students spoke\r\nLatin, lawyers addressed judges in Latin, and the merchants in different\r\ncountries wrote Latin letters to one another. All learned books were\r\ncomposed in Latin until the close of the sixteenth century. This practice\r\nhas not yet been entirely abandoned by European scholars.\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANCE LANGUAGES\r\n\r\nEach European country during the Middle Ages had also its own national\r\ntongue. The so-called Romance languages, [2] including modern French,\r\nItalian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Rumanian, were derived from the Latin\r\nspoken by the Romanized inhabitants of the lands now known as France,\r\nItaly, Spain, Portugal, and Rumania. Their colloquial Latin naturally\r\nlacked the elegance of the literary Latin used by Caesar, Cicero, Vergil,\r\nand other classical authors. The difference between the written and spoken\r\nforms of the language became more marked from the fifth century onward, in\r\nconsequence of the barbarian invasions, which brought about the decline of\r\nlearning. Gradually in each country new and vigorous tongues arose,\r\nrelated to, yet different from, the old classical Latin in pronunciation,\r\ngrammar, and vocabulary.\r\n\r\nFRENCH\r\n\r\nThe indebtedness of the Romance languages to Latin is well illustrated by\r\nthe case of French. It contains less than a thousand words introduced by\r\nthe German invaders of Gaul. Even fewer in number are the words of Celtic\r\norigin. Nearly all the rest are derived from Latin.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF FRENCH\r\n\r\nThe popular Latin of the Gallo-Romans gave rise to two quite independent\r\nlanguages in medieval France. The first was used in the southern part of\r\nthe country; it was called Provençal (from Provence). The second was\r\nspoken in the north, particularly in the region about Paris. The\r\nunification of the French kingdom under Hugh Capet and his successors\r\ngradually extended the speech of northern France over the entire country.\r\nEven to-day, however, one may hear in the south of France the soft and\r\nharmonious Provençal.\r\n\r\nTHE TEUTONIC LANGUAGES\r\n\r\nThe barbarians who poured from the wilds of central Europe into the Roman\r\nworld brought their languages with them. But the speech of the Goths,\r\nVandals, Burgundians, and Lombards disappeared, while that of the Franks\r\nin Gaul, after their conversion to Christianity, gradually gave way to the\r\npopular Latin of their subjects. The Teutonic peoples who remained outside\r\nwhat had been the limits of the Roman world continued to use their native\r\ntongues during the Middle Ages. From them have come modern German, Dutch,\r\nFlemish, [3] and the various Scandinavian languages (Danish, Norwegian,\r\nSwedish, and Icelandic [4]). In their earliest known forms all these\r\nlanguages show unmistakable traces of a common origin.\r\n\r\nANGLO-SAXON\r\n\r\nBritain was the only Roman province in the west of Europe where a Teutonic\r\nlanguage took root and maintained itself. Here the rough, guttural speech\r\nof the Anglo-Saxons so completely drove out the popular Latin that only\r\nsix words were left behind by the Romans, when they abandoned the island\r\nearly in the fifth century. More Celtic words remained, words like\r\n_cradle, crock, mop_, and _pillow_, which were names of household objects,\r\nand the names of rivers, mountains, and lakes, which were not easily\r\nchanged by the invaders. [5] But with such slight exceptions Anglo-Saxon\r\nwas thoroughly Teutonic in vocabulary, as well as in grammar.\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN ANGLO-SAXON\r\n\r\nIn course of time Anglo-Saxon underwent various changes. Christian\r\nmissionaries, from the seventh century onward, introduced many new Latin\r\nterms for church offices, services, and observances. The Danes, besides\r\ncontributing some place-names, gave us that most useful word _are_, and\r\nalso the habit of using _to_ before an infinitive. The coming of the\r\nNormans deeply affected Anglo-Saxon. Norman-French influence helped to\r\nmake the language simpler, by ridding it of the cumbersome declensions and\r\nconjugations which it had in common with all Teutonic tongues. Many new\r\nNorman-French words also crept in, as the hostility of the English people\r\ntoward their conquerors disappeared.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF ENGLISH\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the thirteenth century Anglo-Saxon, or English, as it may\r\nnow be called, had taken on a somewhat familiar appearance, as in these\r\nopening words of the Lord's Prayer: \"Fadir ur, that es in heven, Halud thi\r\nnam to nevene, Thou do as thi rich rike, Thi will on erd be wrought, eek\r\nas it is wrought in heven ay.\" In the poems of Geoffrey Chaucer (about\r\n1340-1400 A.D.), especially in his _Canterbury Tales_, English wears\r\nquite a modern aspect, though the reader is often troubled by the old\r\nspelling and by certain words not now in use. The changes in the grammar\r\nof English have been so extremely small since 1485 A..D.--the beginning of\r\nthe reign of Henry VII [6]--that any Englishman of ordinary education can\r\nread without difficulty a book written more than four hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEOFFREY CHAUCER\r\nFrom an old manuscript in the British Museum, London. The only existing\r\nportrait of Chaucer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPT\r\nFrom an old manuscript now in the possession of the British Museum. The\r\nshrine of Thomas Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, was a celebrated resort\r\nfor (Proofer's Note: Remainder of text unavailable)]\r\n\r\nENGLISH AS A WORLD-LANGUAGE\r\n\r\nWhat in medieval times was the speech of a few millions of Englishmen on a\r\nsingle small island is now spoken by at least one hundred and fifty\r\nmillions of people all over the world. English is well fitted for the role\r\nof a universal language, because of its absence of inflections and its\r\nsimple sentence-order. The great number of one-syllabled words in the\r\nlanguage also makes for ease in understanding it. Furthermore, English has\r\nbeen, and still is, extremely hospitable to new words, so that its\r\nvocabulary has grown very fast by the adoption of terms from Latin,\r\nFrench, and other languages. These have immensely increased the\r\nexpressiveness of English, while giving it a position midway between the\r\nvery different Romance and Teutonic languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n201. DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL LITERATURES\r\n\r\nLATIN HYMNS\r\n\r\nMedieval literature, though inferior in quality to that of Greece and\r\nRome, nevertheless includes many notable productions. In the twelfth and\r\nthe thirteenth centuries Latin hymns reached their perfection. The sublime\r\n_Dies Irae_ (\"Day of Wrath\") presents a picture of the final judgment of\r\nthe wicked. The pathetic _Stabat Mater_, which describes the sorrows of\r\nMary at the foot of the Cross, has been often translated and set to music.\r\nThese two works were written by a companion and biographer of St. Francis\r\nof Assisi. St. Bernard's _Jesu Dulcis Memoria_ (\"Jesus, the Very Thought\r\nof Thee\") forms part of a beautiful hymn nearly two hundred lines in\r\nlength. Part of another hymn, composed by a monk of Cluny, has been\r\nrendered into English as \"Jerusalem the Golden.\" Latin hymns made use of\r\nrhyme, then something of a novelty, and thus helped to popularize this\r\npoetic device.\r\n\r\nLATIN STUDENTS' SONGS\r\n\r\nVery unlike the hymns in character were the Latin songs composed by\r\nstudents who went from one university to another in search of knowledge\r\nand adventure. Far from home, careless and pleasure-seeking, light of\r\npurse and light of heart the wandering scholars of the Middle Ages\r\nfrequented taverns, as well as lecture rooms, and knew the wine-bowl even\r\nbetter than books. Their songs of love, of dancing, drinking, and gaming,\r\nreflect the jovial side of medieval life.\r\n\r\nSONGS OF THE TROUBADOURS\r\n\r\nStill another glimpse of gay society is afforded by the songs of the\r\ntroubadours. These professional poets flourished in the south of France,\r\nbut many of them traveled from court to court in other countries. Their\r\nverses, composed in the Provençal language, were always sung to the\r\naccompaniment of some musical instrument, generally the lute. Romantic\r\nlove and deeds of chivalry were the two themes which most inspired the\r\ntroubadours. They, too, took up the use of rhyme, using it so skillfully\r\nas to become the teachers of Europe in lyric poetry.\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH EPIC\r\n\r\nIf southern France was the native home of the lyric, northern France gave\r\nbirth to epic or narrative verse. Here arose many poems, describing the\r\nexploits of mythical heroes or historic kings. For a long time the poems\r\nremained unwritten and were recited by minstrels, who did not hesitate to\r\nmodify and enlarge them at will. It was not until late in the eleventh\r\ncentury that any epics were written down. They enjoyed high esteem in\r\naristocratic circles and penetrated all countries where feudalism\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\nTHE CHARLEMAGNE LEGEND\r\n\r\nMany of the French epics centered about the commanding personality of\r\nCharlemagne. After his death he became a figure of legend. He was said to\r\nhave reigned one hundred and twenty-five years, to have made a pilgrimage\r\nto Jerusalem, and to have risen from the dead to lead the First Crusade.\r\nAngels inspired his actions. His sword contained the point of the lance\r\nwhich pierced the Savior's side. His standard was the banner of St. Peter.\r\nThough history shows that Charlemagne had little contact with the Moslems,\r\nin the popular mind he stood forth as the great champion of Christianity\r\nagainst Islam.\r\n\r\nSONG OF ROLAND\r\n\r\nThe oldest, and at the same time the finest, epic connected with\r\nCharlemagne is the Song of Roland. [7] The poem centers around Roland, one\r\nof the twelve peers of France. When leading the rearguard of Charlemagne's\r\narmy out of Spain, Roland is suddenly attacked by the treacherous Moors.\r\nHe slays the enemy in heaps with his good sword, Durendal, and only after\r\nnearly all the Franks have perished sounds his magic horn to summon aid.\r\nCharlemagne, fifteen leagues distant, hears its notes and returns quickly.\r\nBut before help arrives, Roland has fallen. He dies on the field of\r\nbattle, with his face to the foe, and a prayer on his lips that \"sweet\r\nFrance\" may never be dishonored. This stirring poem appealed strongly to\r\nthe martial Normans. A medieval chronicler relates that just before the\r\nbattle of Hastings a Norman minstrel rode out between the lines, tossing\r\nhis sword in air and catching it again, as he chanted the song \"of Roland\r\nand of Charlemagne, of Oliver and many a brave vassal who lost his life at\r\nRoncesvalles.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROLAND AT RONCESVALLES\r\nFrom a thirteenth-century window of stained glass in Chartres Cathedral.\r\nAt the right, Roland sounding his horn; at the left Roland endeavoring to\r\nbreak his sword Durendal.]\r\n\r\nTHE ARTHURIAN ROMANCES\r\n\r\nKing Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table were also important figures\r\nin medieval legend. Arthur was said to have reigned in Britain early in\r\nthe sixth century and to have fought against the Anglo-Saxons. Whether he\r\never lived or not we do not know. In the Arthurian romances this Celtic\r\nking stands forth as the model knight, the ideal of noble chivalry. The\r\nNorman conquerors of England carried the romances to France, and here,\r\nwhere feudalism was so deeply rooted, they found a hearty welcome. Sir\r\nThomas Malory's _Morte d' Arthur_, one of the first books to be printed in\r\nEngland, contains many of the narratives from which Tennyson, in his\r\n_Idylls of the King_, and other modern poets have drawn their inspiration.\r\n\r\nTHE NIBELINGENLIED\r\n\r\nThe greatest epic composed in Germany during the Middle Ages is the\r\n_Nibelungenlied_. The poem begins in Burgundy, where three kings hold\r\ncourt at Worms, on the Rhine. Thither comes the hero, Siegfried, ruler of\r\nthe Netherlands. He had slain the mysterious Nibelungs and seized their\r\ntreasure, together with the magic cloud-cloak which rendered its wearer\r\ninvisible to human eyes. He had also killed a dragon and by bathing in its\r\nblood had become invulnerable, except in one place where a linden leaf\r\ntouched his body. Siegfried marries Kriemhild, a beautiful Burgundian\r\nprincess, and with her lives most happily. But a curse attached to the\r\nNibelung treasure, and Siegfried's enemy, the \"grim Hagen,\" treacherously\r\nslays him by a spear thrust in the one spot where he could be hurt. Many\r\nyears afterwards Kriemhild marries Attila, king of the Huns, on condition\r\nthat he help her to vengeance. Hagen and his Burgundians are invited to\r\nHunland, where Kriemhild causes them all to be put to death. The name of\r\nthe poet who compiled and probably wrote much of the _Nibelungenlied_\r\nremains unknown, but his work has a place among the classics of German\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nREYNARD THE FOX\r\n\r\nNo account of medieval literature ought to omit a reference to _Reynard\r\nthe Fox_. This is a long poem, first written in Latin, and then turned\r\ninto the chief languages of Europe. The characters are animals: Reynard,\r\ncunning and audacious, who outwits all his foes; Chanticleer the cock;\r\nBruin the Bear; Isengrim the Wolf; and many others. But they are animals\r\nin name only. We see them worship like Christians, go to Mass, ride on\r\nhorseback, debate in councils, and amuse themselves with hawking and\r\nhunting. Satire often creeps in, as when the villainous Fox confesses his\r\nsins to the Badger or vows that he will go to the Holy Land on a\r\npilgrimage. The special interest of this work lies in the fact that it\r\nexpressed the feelings of the common people, groaning under the oppression\r\nof feudal lords.\r\n\r\nTHE ROBIN HOOD BALLADS\r\n\r\nThe same democratic spirit breathes in the old English ballads of the\r\noutlaw Robin Hood. According to some accounts he flourished in the second\r\nhalf of the twelfth century, when Henry II and Richard the Lion-hearted\r\nreigned over England. Robin Hood, with his merry men, leads an adventurous\r\nlife in Sherwood Forest, engaging in feats of strength and hunting the\r\nking's tall deer. Bishops, sheriffs, and gamekeepers are his only enemies.\r\nFor the common people he has the greatest pity, and robs the rich to endow\r\nthe poor. Courtesy, generosity, and love of fair play are some of the\r\ncharacteristics which made him a popular hero. If King Arthur was the\r\nideal knight, Robin Hood was the ideal yeoman. The ballads about him were\r\nsung by country folk for hundreds of years.\r\n\r\n\r\n202. ROMANESQUE AND GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE; THE CATHEDRALS\r\n\r\nTWO ARCHITECTURAL STYLES\r\n\r\nThe genius of the Middle Ages found its highest expression, not in books,\r\nbut in buildings. For several hundred years after the barbarian invasions\r\narchitecture had made little progress in western Europe, outside of Italy,\r\nwhich was subject to Byzantine influence, [8] and Spain, which was a\r\ncenter of Mohammedan culture. [9] Beginning about 800 A.D. came a revival,\r\nand the adoption of an architectural style called Romanesque, because it\r\nwent back to Roman principles of construction. Romanesque architecture\r\narose in northern Italy and southern France and gradually spread to other\r\nEuropean countries. It was followed about 1100 A D. by the Gothic style of\r\narchitecture, which prevailed during the next four centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF SALISBURY CATHEDRAL, ENGLAND\r\nNote the double transepts.]\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANESQUE CHURCH\r\n\r\nThe church of the early Christians seems to have been modeled upon the\r\nRoman basilica, with its arrangement of nave and aisles, its circular\r\narched recess (apse) at one end, and its flat, wooden ceiling supported by\r\ncolumns. [10] The Romanesque church departed from the basilican plan by\r\nthe introduction of transepts, thus giving the building the form of a\r\nLatin cross. A dome, which might be covered by a pointed roof, was\r\ngenerally raised over the junction of the nave and transepts. At the same\r\ntime the apse was enlarged so as to form the choir, a place reserved for\r\nthe clergy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REIMS CATHEDRAL\r\nThe cathedral of Notre Dame at Reims in northwestern France stands on the\r\nsite where Clovis was baptized by St Remi. Here most of the French kings\r\nwere consecrated with holy oil by the archbishops of Reims. Except the\r\nwest front, which was built in the fourteenth century, the cathedral was\r\ncompleted by the end of the thirteenth century. The towers, 267 feet high,\r\nwere originally designed to reach 394 feet. The facade, with its three\r\narched portals exquisite rose window, and \"gallery of the kings,\" is\r\njustly celebrated. The cathedral--walls, roof, statues, and windows--has\r\nbeen terribly damaged by the German bombardment during the late war.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLOGNE CATHEDRAL\r\nThe Cathedral, or Dom, one of the finest monuments of Gothic architecture\r\nin Europe, was begun in the thirteenth century. The work of building\r\nproceeded slowly and at the time of the Reformation it ceased altogether.\r\nThe structure was finally completed during the nineteenth century, and in\r\n1880 AD it was opened in the presence of the emperor, William I. The\r\nCathedral, which is in the form of a cross, measures 480 feet in length\r\nand 282 feet in breadth. Each of the towers reaches the height of 511\r\nfeet. The very numerous and richly-colored windows add greatly to the\r\nimposing effect of the interior.]\r\n\r\nVAULTING AND THE ROUND ARCH\r\n\r\nThe Romanesque church also differed from a basilica in the use of vaulting\r\nto take the place of a flat ceiling. The old Romans had constructed their\r\nvaulted roofs and domes in concrete, which forms a rigid mass and rests\r\nsecurely upon the walls like the lid of a box. [11] Medieval architects,\r\nhowever, built in stone, which exerts an outward thrust and tends to force\r\nthe walls apart. Consequently they found it necessary to make the walls\r\nvery thick and to strengthen them by piers, or buttresses, on the outside\r\nof the edifice. It was also necessary to reduce the width of the vaulted\r\nspaces. The vaulting, windows, and doorways had the form of the round\r\narch, that is, a semicircle, as in the ancient Roman monuments. [12]\r\n\r\nTHE GOTHIC STYLE\r\n\r\nGothic architecture arose in France in the country around Paris, at a time\r\nwhen the French kingdom was taking the lead in European affairs. Later it\r\nspread to England, Germany, the Netherlands, and even to southern Europe.\r\nAs an old chronicler wrote, \"It was as if the whole world had thrown off\r\nthe rags of its ancient time, and had arrayed itself in the white robes of\r\nthe churches.\" The term Gothic was applied contemptuously to this\r\narchitectural style by writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,\r\nwho regarded everything non-classical as barbarous. They believed it to be\r\nan invention of the barbarian Goths, and so they called it Gothic. The\r\nname has stuck, as bad names have a habit of doing, but nowadays every one\r\nrecognizes the greatness of this medieval art. The most beautiful\r\nbuildings of the Middle Ages are of Gothic architecture.\r\n\r\nRIBBED VAULTING AND THE FLYING BUTTRESS\r\n\r\nThe Gothic style formed a natural development of the Romanesque style. The\r\narchitects of a Gothic church wished to retain the vaulted ceiling but at\r\nthe same time to do away with thick, solid walls, which had so little\r\nwindow space as to leave the interior of the building dark gloomy. They\r\nsolved this problem, in the first place, by using a great number of stone\r\nribs, which gathered up the weight of the ceiling and rested on pillars.\r\nRibbed vaulting made possible higher ceilings, spanning wider areas, than\r\nin Romanesque churches. [13] In the second place, the pillars supporting\r\nthe ribs were themselves connected by means of flying buttresses with\r\nstout piers of masonry outside the walls of the church. [14] These walls,\r\nrelieved from the pressure of the ceiling, now became a mere screen to\r\nkeep out the weather. They could be built of light materials and opened up\r\nwith high, wide windows.\r\n\r\nTHE POINTED ARCH\r\n\r\nRibbed vaulting and the flying buttress are the distinctive features of\r\nGothic architecture. A third feature, noteworthy but not so important, is\r\nthe use of the pointed arch. It was not Christian in origin, for it had\r\nlong been known to the Arabs in the East and the Moslem conquerors of\r\nSicily. [15] The semicircular or round arch can be only half as high as it\r\nis wide, but the pointed arch may vary greatly in its proportions. The use\r\nof this device enabled the Gothic builder to bridge over different widths\r\nat any required height. It is also lighter and more graceful than the\r\nround arch. [16]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSS SECTION OF AMIENS CATHEDRAL\r\nA, vaulting; B, ribs; C, flying buttresses; D, buttresses; E, low windows;\r\nF, clerestory.]\r\n\r\nGOTHIC ORNAMENT\r\n\r\nThe labors of the Gothic architect were admirably seconded by those of\r\nother artists. The sculptor cut figures of men, animals, and plants in the\r\nutmost profusion. The painter covered vacant wall spaces with brilliant\r\nmosaics and frescoes. The wood-carver made exquisite choir stalls,\r\npulpits, altars, and screens. Master workmen filled the stone tracery of\r\nthe windows with stained glass unequaled in coloring by the finest modern\r\nwork. Some rigorous churchmen like St. Bernard condemned the expense of\r\nthese magnificent cathedrals, but most men found in their beauty an\r\nadditional reason to praise God.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GARGOYLES ON THE CATHEDRAL OF NOTRE DAME, PARIS\r\nStrange grotesque figures and faces of stone used as ornaments of Gothic\r\nbuildings and as spouts to carry off rain water. They represent beasts,\r\ndemons, and other creations of medieval fancy.]\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL AS A RELIGIOUS EDIFICE\r\n\r\nThe Gothic cathedral, in fact, perfectly expressed the religious spirit of\r\nthe Middle Ages. For its erection kings and nobles offered costly gifts.\r\nThe common people, when they had no money to give, contributed their\r\nlabor, each man doing what he could to carry upward the walls and towers\r\nand to perfect every part of God's dwelling. The interior of such a\r\ncathedral, with its vast nave rising in swelling arches to the vaulted\r\nroof, its clustered columns, its glowing windows, and infinite variety of\r\nornamentation, forms the most awe-inspiring sanctuary ever raised by man.\r\nIt is a prayer, a hymn, a sermon in stone.\r\n\r\nTHE SECULAR GOTHIC\r\n\r\nGothic architecture, though at first confined to churches, came to be used\r\nfor other buildings. Among the monuments of the secular Gothic are\r\nbeautiful town halls, guild halls, markets, and charming private houses.\r\n[17] But the cathedral remained the best expression of the Gothic style.\r\n\r\n\r\n203. EDUCATION; THE UNIVERSITIES\r\n\r\nCOMMON SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nNot less important than the Gothic cathedrals for the understanding of\r\nmedieval civilization were the universities. They grew out of the monastic\r\nand cathedral schools where boys were trained to become monks or priests.\r\nSuch schools had been created or restored by Charlemagne. [18] The\r\nteaching, which lay entirely in the hands of the clergy, was elementary in\r\ncharacter. Pupils learned enough Latin grammar to read religious books, if\r\nnot always to understand them, and enough music to follow the services of\r\nthe Church. They also studied arithmetic by means of the awkward Roman\r\nnotation, received a smattering of astronomy, and sometimes gained a\r\nlittle knowledge of such subjects as geography, law, and philosophy.\r\nBesides these monastic and cathedral schools, others were maintained by\r\nthe guilds. Boys who had no regular schooling often received instruction\r\nfrom the parish priest of the village or town. Illiteracy was common\r\nenough in medieval times, but the mass of the people were by no means\r\nentirely uneducated.\r\n\r\nRISE OF UNIVERSITIES\r\n\r\nBetween 1150 and 1500 A.D. at least eighty universities were established\r\nin western Europe. Some speedily became extinct, but there are still about\r\nfifty European institutions of learning which started in the Middle Ages.\r\nThe earliest universities did not look to the state or to some princely\r\nbenefactor for their foundation. They arose, as it were, spontaneously. In\r\nthe eleventh and twelfth centuries Europe felt the thrill of a great\r\nintellectual revival. It was stimulated by intercourse with the highly\r\ncultivated Arabs in Spain, Sicily, and the East, and with the Greek\r\nscholars of Constantinople during the crusades. The desire for instruction\r\nbecame so general that the common schools could not satisfy it. Other\r\nschools were then opened in the cities and to them flocked eager learners\r\nfrom every quarter.\r\n\r\nPETER ABELARD 1079-1142 A.D.\r\n\r\nHow easily a university might grow up about the personality of some\r\neminent teacher is shown by the career of Abelard. The eldest son of a\r\nnoble family in Brittany, Abelard would naturally have entered upon a\r\nmilitary career, but he chose instead the life of a scholar and the\r\ncontests of debate. When still a young man he came to Paris and attended\r\nthe lectures given by a master of the cathedral school of Notre Dame.\r\nBefore long he had overcome his instructor in discussion, thus\r\nestablishing his own reputation. At the early age of twenty-two Abelard\r\nhimself set up as a lecturer. Few teachers have ever attracted so large\r\nand so devoted a following. His lecture room under the shadow of the great\r\ncathedral was filled with a crowd of youths and men drawn from all\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF PARIS\r\n\r\nThe fame of Abelard led to an increase of masters and students at Paris\r\nand so paved the way for the establishment of the university there, later\r\nin the twelfth century. Paris soon became such a center of learning,\r\nparticularly in theology and philosophy, that a medieval writer referred\r\nto it as \"the mill where the world's corn is ground, and the hearth where\r\nits bread is baked.\" The university of Paris, in the time of its greatest\r\nprosperity, had over five thousand students. It furnished the model for\r\nthe English university of Oxford, as well as for the learned institutions\r\nof Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, and Germany.\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF BOLOGNA\r\n\r\nThe institutions of learning in southern Europe were modeled, more or\r\nless, upon the university of Bologna. At this Italian city, in the middle\r\nof the twelfth century, a celebrated teacher named Irnerius gathered about\r\nhim thousands of pupils for the study of the Justinian code. [19] The\r\nuniversity developed out of his law school. Bologna was the center from\r\nwhich the Roman system of jurisprudence made its way into France, Germany,\r\nand other Continental countries. From Bologna, also, came the monk\r\nGratian, who drew up the accepted text-book of canon law, as followed in\r\nall Church courts. [20] What Roman law was to the Empire canon law was to\r\nthe Papacy.\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nThe word \"university\" [21] meant at first simply a union or association.\r\nIn the Middle Ages all artisans were organized in guilds, [22] and when\r\nmasters and pupils associated themselves for teaching and study they\r\nnaturally copied the guild form. This was the more necessary since the\r\nstudent body included so many foreigners, who found protection against\r\nannoyances only as members of a guild.\r\n\r\nDEGREES\r\n\r\nLike a craft guild a university consisted of masters (the professors), who\r\nhad the right to teach, and students, both elementary and advanced, who\r\ncorresponded to apprentices and journeymen. After several years of study a\r\nstudent who had passed part of his examination became a \"bachelor of arts\"\r\nand might teach certain elementary subjects to those beneath him. Upon the\r\ncompletion of the full course--usually six years in length--the bachelor\r\ntook his final examinations and, if he passed them, received the coveted\r\ndegree of \"master of arts.\" But as is the case to-day, many who attended\r\nthe universities never took a degree at all.\r\n\r\nTHE TEACHERS\r\n\r\nA university of the Middle Ages did not need an expensive collection of\r\nlibraries, laboratories, and museums. Its only necessary equipment\r\nconsisted in lecture rooms for the professors. Not even benches or chairs\r\nwere required. Students often sat on the straw-strewn floors. The high\r\nprice of manuscripts compelled professors to give all instruction by\r\nlectures. This method of teaching has been retained in modern\r\nuniversities, since even the printed book is a poor substitute for a\r\nscholar's inspiring words.\r\n\r\nTHE STUDENTS\r\n\r\nThe universities being under the protection of the Church, it was natural\r\nthat those who attended them should possess some of the privileges of\r\nclergymen. Students were not required to pay taxes or to serve in the\r\narmy. They also enjoyed the right of trial in their own courts. This was\r\nan especially valuable privilege, for medieval students were constantly\r\ngetting into trouble with the city authorities. The sober annals of many a\r\nuniversity are relieved by tales of truly Homeric conflicts between Town\r\nand Gown. When the students were dissatisfied with their treatment in one\r\nplace, it was always easy for them to go to another university. Sometimes\r\nmasters and scholars made off in a body. Oxford appears to have owed its\r\nexistence to a large migration of English students from Paris, Cambridge\r\narose as the result of a migration from Oxford, and the German university\r\nof Leipzig sprang from that of Prague in Bohemia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF NEW COLLEGE, OXFORD\r\nNew College, despite its name, is one of the oldest of the Oxford\r\ncollegiate foundations. It was established in 1379 A.D. by William of\r\nWykeham. The illustration shows the chapel, the cloisters consecrated in\r\n1400 A.D., and the detached tower, a tall, massive structure on the line\r\nof the city wall.]\r\n\r\nCOLLEGES\r\n\r\nThe members of a university usually lived in a number of colleges. These\r\nseem to have been at first little more than lodging-houses, where poor\r\nstudents were cared for at the expense of some benefactor. In time,\r\nhowever, as the colleges increased in wealth, through the gifts made to\r\nthem, they became centers of instruction under the direction of masters.\r\nAt Oxford and Cambridge, where the collegiate system has been retained to\r\nthe present time, each college has its separate buildings and enjoys the\r\nprivilege of self-government.\r\n\r\nFACULTIES\r\n\r\nThe studies in a medieval university were grouped under the four faculties\r\nof arts, theology, law, and medicine. The first-named faculty taught the\r\n\"seven liberal arts,\" that is, grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic,\r\ngeometry, astronomy, and music. They formed a legacy from old Roman\r\neducation. Theology, law, and medicine then, as now, were professional\r\nstudies, taken up after the completion of the Arts course. Owing to the\r\nconstant movement of students from one university to another, each\r\ninstitution tended to specialize in one or more subjects. Thus, Paris came\r\nto be noted for theology, Montpellier, Padua, and Salerno for medicine,\r\nand Orléans, Bologna, and Salamanca for law.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOWER OF MAGDALEN COLLEGE, OXFORD\r\nMagdalen (pronounced Maudlin) is perhaps the most beautiful college in\r\nOxford. The bell tower stands on High Street, the principal thoroughfare\r\nof Oxford, and adjoins Magdalen Bridge, built across the Cherwell. Begun\r\nin 1492 A.D.; completed in 1505 A.D. From its summit a Latin hymn is sung\r\nevery year on the morning of May Day. This graceful tower has been several\r\ntimes imitated in American collegiate structures.]\r\n\r\n\r\n204. SCHOLASTICISM\r\n\r\nTHEOLOGICAL STUDY\r\n\r\nTheology formed the chief subject of instruction in most medieval\r\nuniversities. Nearly all the celebrated scholars of the age were\r\ntheologians. They sought to arrange the doctrines of the Church in\r\nsystematic and reasonable form, in order to answer those great questions\r\nconcerning the nature of God and of the soul which have always occupied\r\nthe human mind. For this purpose it was necessary to call in the aid of\r\nphilosophy. The union of theology and philosophy produced what is known as\r\nscholasticism. [23]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL, CAMBRIDGE.\r\nThe chief architectural ornament of King's College, founded by King Henry\r\nVI, is the chapel in the Gothic perpendicular style.* This building was\r\nbegun in 1446 A.D., but was not completed until nearly seventy years\r\nlater. The finest features of the interior are the fan vaulting which\r\nextends throughout the chapel, the stained-glass windows, and the wooden\r\norgan screen.]\r\n\r\nABELARD AND FREEDOM OF THOUGHT\r\n\r\nThe scholastics were loyal children of the Church and did not presume to\r\nquestion her teaching in matters of religion. They held that faith\r\nprecedes reason. \"The Christian,\" it was said, \"ought to advance to\r\nknowledge through faith, not come to faith through knowledge.\" The\r\nbrilliant Abelard, with his keenly critical mind, found what he considered\r\na flaw in this position: on many subjects the authorities themselves\r\ndisagreed. To show this he wrote a little book called _Sic et Non_ (\"Yes\r\nand No\"), setting forth the conflicting opinions of the Church Fathers on\r\none hundred and fifty-eight points of theology. In such cases how could\r\ntruth be reached unless one reasoned it out for oneself? \"Constant\r\nquestioning,\" he declared, \"is the key to wisdom.... Through doubting we\r\ncome to inquiry and through inquiry we perceive the truth.\" But this\r\nreliance on the unaided human reason as a means of obtaining knowledge did\r\nnot meet with approval, and Abelard's views were condemned as unsound.\r\nAbelard, indeed, was a man in advance of his age. Freedom of thought had\r\nto wait many centuries before its rights should be acknowledged.\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF ARISTOTLE\r\n\r\nThe philosophy on which the scholastics relied was chiefly that of\r\nAristotle. [24] Christian Europe read him at first in Latin translations\r\nfrom the Arabic, but versions were later made from Greek copies found in\r\nConstantinople and elsewhere in the East. This revival of Aristotle,\r\nthough it broadened men's minds by acquainting them with the ideas of the\r\ngreatest of Greek thinkers, had serious drawbacks. It discouraged rather\r\nthan favored the search for fresh truth. Many scholastics were satisfied\r\nto appeal to Aristotle's authority, rather than take the trouble of\r\nfinding out things for themselves. The story is told of a medieval student\r\nwho, having detected spots in the sun, announced his discovery to a\r\nlearned man. \"My son,\" said the latter, \"I have read Aristotle many times,\r\nand I assure you there is nothing of the kind mentioned by him. Be certain\r\nthat the spots which you have seen are in your eyes and not in the sun.\"\r\n\r\nST. THOMAS AQUINAS, 1227-1274 A.D.\r\n\r\nThere were many famous scholastics, or \"schoolmen,\" but easily the\r\nforemost among them was the Italian monk, Thomas Aquinas. He taught at\r\nParis, Cologne, Rome, and Bologna, and became so celebrated for learning\r\nas to be known as the \"Angelic Doctor.\" Though Aquinas died at an early\r\nage, he left behind him no less than eighteen folio volumes. His _Summa\r\nTheologiae_ (\"Compendium of Theology\"), as the name indicates, gathered up\r\nall that the Middle Ages believed of the relations between God and man.\r\nThe Roman Church has placed him among her saints and still recommends the\r\nstudy of his writings as the foundation of all sound theology.\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOLASTIC METHOD\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show that the method of study in medieval\r\nuniversities was not that which generally obtains to-day. There was almost\r\nno original research. Law students memorized the Justinian code. Medical\r\nstudents learned anatomy and physiology from old Greek books, instead of\r\nin the dissecting room. Theologians and philosophers went to the Bible,\r\nthe Church Fathers, or Aristotle for the solution of all problems. They\r\noften debated the most subtle questions, for instance, \"Can God ever know\r\nmore than He knows that He knows?\" Mental gymnastics of this sort\r\nfurnished a good training in logic, but added nothing to the sum of human\r\nknowledge. Scholasticism, accordingly, fell into disrepute, in proportion\r\nas men began to substitute scientific observation and experiment for\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n205. SCIENCE AND MAGIC\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC INVENTIONS\r\n\r\nNot all medieval learning took the form of scholasticism. The twelfth and\r\nthirteenth centuries were marked by a healthy interest in science. Long\r\nencyclopedias, written in Latin, collected all available information about\r\nthe natural world. The study of physics made conspicuous progress, partly\r\nas a result of Arab influence. Various scientific inventions, including\r\nmagnifying glasses and clocks, were worked out. The mariner's compass,\r\nperhaps derived from the Arabs, also came into general use. [25]\r\n\r\nROGER BACON, ABOUT 1214-1294 A.D.\r\n\r\nAs representative of this scientific interest we may take the Englishman,\r\nRoger Bacon. He studied at Paris, where his attainments secured for him\r\nthe title of the \"Wonderful Doctor,\" and lectured at Oxford. At a period\r\nwhen Aristotle's influence was unbounded, Bacon turned away from\r\nscholastic philosophy to mathematics and the sciences. No great\r\ndiscoveries were made by him, but it is interesting to read a passage in\r\none of his works where some modern inventions are distinctly foreseen. In\r\ntime, he wrote, ships will be moved without rowers, and carriages will be\r\npropelled without animals to draw them. Machines for flying will also be\r\nconstructed, \"wherein a man sits revolving some engine by which artificial\r\nwings are made to beat the air like a flying bird.\" Even in Bacon's day it\r\nwould appear that men were trying to make steamboats, automobiles, and\r\naëroplanes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROGER BACON]\r\n\r\nGUNPOWDER\r\n\r\nThe discovery of gunpowder, a compound of saltpeter, charcoal, and\r\nsulphur, has often been attributed to Bacon, probably incorrectly. Bacon\r\nand other men of his time seem to have been familiar with the composition\r\nof gunpowder, but they regarded it as merely a sort of firework, producing\r\na sudden and brilliant flame. They little suspected that in a confined\r\nspace the expansive power of its gases could be used to hurl projectiles.\r\nGunpowder was occasionally manufactured during the fourteenth century, but\r\nfor a long time it made more noise than it did harm. Small brass cannon,\r\nthrowing stone balls, began at length to displace the medieval siege\r\nweapons, and still later muskets took the place of the bow, the cross-bow,\r\nand the pike. The revolution in the art of warfare introduced by gunpowder\r\nhad vast importance. It destroyed the usefulness of the castle and enabled\r\nthe peasant to fight the mailed knight on equal terms. Gunpowder,\r\naccordingly, must be included among the forces which brought about the\r\ndownfall of feudalism.\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY AND ALCHEMY\r\n\r\nThe study of chemistry also engaged the attention of medieval\r\ninvestigators. It was, however, much mixed up with alchemy, a false\r\nscience which the Middle Ages had received from the Greeks, and they, in\r\nturn, from the Egyptians. The alchemists believed that minerals possessed\r\na real life of their own and that they were continually developing in the\r\nground toward the state of gold, the perfect metal. It was necessary,\r\ntherefore, to discover the \"philosopher's stone,\" which would turn all\r\nmetals into gold. The alchemists never found it, but they learned a good\r\ndeal about the various metals and discovered a number of compounds and\r\ncolors. In this way alchemy contributed to the advance of chemistry.\r\n\r\nASTRONOMY AND ASTROLOGY\r\n\r\nAstronomy in the Middle Ages was the most advanced of any natural science,\r\nthough the telescope and the Copernican theory [26] were as yet in the\r\nfuture. Astronomy, the wise mother, had a foolish daughter, astrology, the\r\norigin of which can be traced back to Babylonia. [27] Medieval students no\r\nlonger regarded the stars as divine, but they believed that the natural\r\nworld and the life of men were controlled by celestial influences. Hence\r\nastrologers professed to predict the fate of a person from the position of\r\nthe planets at the time of his birth. Astrological rules were also drawn\r\nfrom the signs of the zodiac. A child born under the sign of the Lion will\r\nbe courageous; one born under the Crab will not go forward well in life;\r\none born under the Waterman will probably be drowned, and so forth. Such\r\nfancies seem absurd enough, but in the Middle Ages educated people\r\nentertained them.\r\n\r\nMEDIEVAL CREDULITY\r\n\r\nAlchemy and astrology were not the only instances of medieval credulity.\r\nThe most improbable stories found ready acceptance. Roger Bacon, for\r\ninstance, thought that \"flying dragons\" still existed in Europe and that\r\neating their flesh lengthened human life. Works on natural history soberly\r\ndescribed the lizard-like salamander, which dwelt in fire, and the\r\nphoenix, a bird which, after living for five hundred years, burned itself\r\nto death and then rose again full grown from the ashes. Another fabulous\r\ncreature was the unicorn, with the head and body of a horse, the hind legs\r\nof an antelope, the beard of a goat, and a long, sharp horn set in the\r\nmiddle of the forehead. Various plants and minerals were also credited\r\nwith marvelous powers. Thus, the nasturtium, used as a liniment, would\r\nkeep one's hair from falling out, and the sapphire, when powdered and\r\nmixed with milk, would heal ulcers and cure headache. Such quaint beliefs\r\nlinger to-day among uneducated people, even in civilized lands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAGICIAN RESCUED FROM THE DEVIL\r\nMiniature in a thirteenth-century manuscript in the Bibliothèque\r\nNationale, Paris. The Devil, attempting to seize a magician who had formed\r\na pact with him, is prevented by a lay brother.]\r\n\r\nMAGICIANS\r\n\r\nMagicians of every sort flourished in the Middle Ages. Oneiromancers [28]\r\ntook omens from dreams. Palmists read fortunes in the lines and\r\nirregularities of the hand. Necromancers [29] professed to reveal the\r\nfuture by pretended communications with departed spirits. Other magicians\r\nmade talismans or lucky objects to be worn on the person, mirrors in which\r\nthe images of the dead or the absent were reflected, and various powders\r\nwhich, when mixed with food or drink, would inspire hatred or affection in\r\nthe one consuming them. Indeed, it would be easy to draw up a long list of\r\nthe devices by which practitioners of magic made a living at the expense\r\nof the ignorant and the superstitious.\r\n\r\n\r\n206. POPULAR SUPERSTITIONS\r\n\r\nFOLK TALES\r\n\r\nMany medieval superstitions are preserved in folk tales, or \"fairy\r\nstories.\" Every child now reads these tales in books, but until the\r\nnineteenth century very few of them had been collected and written down.\r\n[30] They lived on the lips of the people, being told by mothers and\r\nnurses to children and by young and old about the firesides during the\r\nlong winter evenings. Story-telling formed one of the chief amusements of\r\nthe Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nFAIRIES\r\n\r\nThe fairies who appear so commonly in folk tales are known by different\r\nnames. They are bogies, brownies, goblins, pixies, kobolds (in Germany),\r\ntrolls (in Denmark), and so on. The Celts, especially, had a lively faith\r\nin fairies, and it was from Wales, Scotland, and Ireland that many stories\r\nabout them became current in Europe after the tenth century. Some students\r\nhave explained the belief in fairies as due to memories of an ancient\r\npygmy people dwelling in underground homes. But most of these supernatural\r\nbeings seem to be the descendants of the spirits and demons which in\r\nsavage fancy haunt the world.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF FAIRIES\r\n\r\nA comparison of European folk tales shows that fairies have certain\r\ncharacteristics in common. They live in palaces underneath the ground,\r\nfrom which they emerge at twilight to dance in mystic circles. They are\r\nruled by kings and queens and are possessed of great wealth. Though\r\nusually invisible, they may sometimes be seen, especially by people who\r\nhave the faculty of perceiving spirits. To mortals the fairies are\r\ngenerally hostile, leading wanderers astray, often blighting crops and\r\ncattle, and shooting arrows which carry disease and death. They are\r\nconstantly on the watch to carry off human beings to their realm. A\r\nprisoner must be released at the end of a certain time, unless he tastes\r\nfairy food, in which event he can never return. Children in cradles are\r\nfrequently snatched away by the fairies, who leave, instead, imps of their\r\nown called \"changelings.\" A changeling may always be recognized by its\r\npeevishness and backwardness in learning to walk and speak. If well\r\ntreated, the fairies will sometimes show their gratitude by bestowing on\r\ntheir favorites health, wealth, and long life. Lucky the child who can\r\ncount on a \"fairy god-mother.\"\r\n\r\nGIANTS AND OGRES\r\n\r\nStories of giants are common in folk tales. Giants are often represented\r\nas not only big but also stupid, and as easily overcome by keen-witted\r\nhuman foes like \"Jack the Giant-killer.\" It may be that traditions of pre-\r\nhistoric peoples have sometimes given birth to legends of giants. Another\r\nsource of stories concerning them has been the discovery of huge fossil\r\nbones, such as those of the mammoth or mastodon, which were formerly\r\nsupposed to be bones of gigantic men. The ogres, who sometimes figure in\r\nfolk tales, are giants with a taste for human flesh. They recall the\r\ncannibals of the savage world.\r\n\r\nWEREWOLVES\r\n\r\nWerewolves were persons who, by natural gift or magic art, were thought to\r\nhave the power of turning themselves for a time into wild beasts\r\n(generally wolves or bears). In this animal shape they ravaged flocks and\r\ndevoured young children. A werewolf was said to sleep only two nights in\r\nthe month and to spend the rest of the time roaming the woods and fields.\r\nTrials of persons accused of being werewolves were held in France as late\r\nas the end of the sixteenth century. Even now the belief is found in out-\r\nof-the-way parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nTHE EVIL EYE\r\n\r\nAnother medieval superstition was that of the evil eye. According to this\r\nbelief, certain persons could bewitch, injure, and kill by a glance.\r\nChildren and domestic animals were thought to be particularly susceptible\r\nto the effects of \"fascination.\" In order to guard against it charms of\r\nvarious sorts, including texts from the Bible, were carried about. The\r\nbelief in the evil eye came into Europe from pagan antiquity. It survived\r\nthe Middle Ages and lingers yet among uneducated people.\r\n\r\nWITCHCRAFT\r\n\r\nThe superstitions relating to werewolves and the evil eye are particular\r\nforms of the belief in witchcraft, or \"black magic.\" The Middle Ages could\r\nnot escape this delusion, which was firmly held by the Greeks and Romans\r\nand other ancient peoples. Witchcraft had, indeed, a prehistoric origin\r\nand the belief in it still prevails in savage society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WITCHES' SABBATH.]\r\n\r\nFEATURES OF EUROPEAN WITCHCRAFT\r\n\r\nWitches and wizards were supposed to have sold themselves to the Devil,\r\nreceiving in return the power to work magic. They could change themselves\r\nor others into animals, they had charms against the hurt of weapons, they\r\ncould raise storms and destroy crops, and they could convey thorns, pins,\r\nand other objects into their victims' bodies, thus causing sickness and\r\ndeath. At night they rode on broomsticks through the air and assembled in\r\nsome lonely place for feasts, dances, and wild revels. At these \"Witches'\r\nSabbaths,\" as they were called, the Devil himself attended and taught his\r\nfollowers their diabolic arts. There were various tests for the discovery\r\nof witches and wizards, the most usual being the ordeal by water. [31]\r\n\r\nWITCHCRAFT PERSECUTIONS\r\n\r\nThe numerous trials and executions for witchcraft form a dark page in\r\nhistory. Thousands of harmless old men and women were put to death on the\r\ncharge of being leagued with the Devil. Even the most intelligent and\r\nhumane people believed in the reality of witchcraft and found a\r\njustification for its punishment in the Scriptural command, \"Thou shalt\r\nnot suffer a witch to live.\" [32] The witch epidemic which broke out in\r\nAmerica during the seventeenth century, reaching its height at Salem,\r\nMassachusetts, was simply a reflection of the European fear and hatred of\r\nwitches.\r\n\r\nUNLUCKY DAYS\r\n\r\nThe Middle Ages inherited from antiquity the observance of unlucky days.\r\nThey went under the name of \"Egyptian days,\" so called because it was held\r\nthat on one of them the plagues had been sent to devastate the land of\r\nEgypt and on another Pharaoh and his host had been swallowed up in the Red\r\nSea. At least twenty-four days in the year were regarded as very unlucky.\r\nAt such times one ought not to buy and sell, to build a house, to plant a\r\nfield, to travel or, in fact, to undertake anything at all important.\r\nAfter the sixteenth century the belief in unlucky days declined, but there\r\nstill exists a prejudice against fishermen starting out to fish, or seamen\r\nto take a voyage, or landsmen a journey, or domestic servants to enter a\r\nnew place, on a Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\n207. POPULAR AMUSEMENTS AND FESTIVALS\r\n\r\nINDOOR GAMES\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to turn from the superstitions of the Middle Ages to the\r\ngames, sports, and festivals which helped to make life agreeable alike for\r\nrich and poor, for nobles and peasants. Some indoor games are of eastern\r\norigin. Thus chess, with which European peoples seem to have become\r\nacquainted as early as the tenth century [33] arose in India as a war\r\ngame. On each side a king and his general, with chariots, cavalry,\r\nelephants, and infantry, met in battle array. These survive in the rooks,\r\nknights, bishops, and pawns of the modern game. Checkers is a sort of\r\nsimplified chess, in which the pieces are all pawns, till they get across\r\nthe board and become kings. Playing cards are another Oriental invention.\r\nThey were introduced into Europe in the fourteenth century, either by the\r\nArabs or the gypsies. Their first use seems to have been for telling\r\nfortunes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHESS PIECES OF CHARLEMAGNE\r\nBibliothèque Nationale, Paris. The figures are carved in ivory.]\r\n\r\nOUTDOOR GAMES\r\n\r\nMany outdoor games are derived from those played in medieval times. How\r\none kind of game may become the parent of many others is seen in the case\r\nof the ball-play. The ancients tossed and caught balls as children do now.\r\nThey also had a game in which each side tried to secure the ball and throw\r\nit over the adversary's goal line. This game lasted on into the Middle\r\nAges, and from it football has descended. The ancients seem never to have\r\nused a stick or bat in their ball-play. The Persians, however, began to\r\nplay ball on horseback, using a long mallet for the purpose, and\r\nintroduced their new sport throughout Asia. Under the Tibetan name of\r\n_pulu_ (\"ball\") it found its way into Europe. When once the mallet had\r\nbeen invented for use on horseback, it could be easily used on foot, and\r\nso polo gave rise to the various games in which balls are hit with bats,\r\nincluding tennis, hockey, golf, cricket, and croquet.\r\n\r\nBAITING\r\n\r\nThe difference between our ideas of what constitutes \"sport\" and those of\r\nour ancestors is shown by the popularity of baiting. In the twelfth\r\ncentury bulls, bears, and even horses were baited. Cock-fighting formed\r\nanother common amusement. It was not till the nineteenth century that an\r\nEnglish society for the prevention of cruelty to animals succeeded in\r\ngetting a law passed which forbade these cruel sports. Most other European\r\ncountries have now followed England's example.\r\n\r\nFESTIVALS\r\n\r\nNo account of life in the Middle Ages can well omit some reference to the\r\ncelebration of festivals. For the peasant and artisan they provided relief\r\nfrom physical exertion, and for all classes of society the pageants,\r\nprocessions, sports, feasts, and merry-makings which accompanied them\r\nfurnished welcome diversion. Medieval festivals included not only those of\r\nthe Christian Year, [34] but also others which had come down from pre-\r\nChristian times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEAR BAITING.\r\nFrom the Luttrell Psalter.]\r\n\r\nSEASONAL FESTIVALS\r\n\r\nMany festivals not of Christian origin were derived from the ceremonies\r\nwith which the heathen peoples of Europe had been accustomed to mark the\r\nchanges of the seasons. Thus, April Fool's Day formed a relic of\r\nfestivities held at the vernal equinox. May Day, another festival of\r\nspring, honored the spirits of trees and of all budding vegetation. The\r\npersons who acted as May kings and May queens represented these spirits.\r\nAccording to the original custom a new May tree was cut down in the forest\r\nevery year, but later a permanent May pole was set up on the village\r\ncommon. On Midsummer Eve (June 23), which marked the summer solstice, came\r\nthe fire festival, when people built bonfires and leaped over them, walked\r\nin procession with torches round the fields, and rolled burning wheels\r\ndown the hillsides. These curious rites may have been once connected with\r\nsun worship. Hallow Eve, so called from being the eve of All Saints' Day\r\n(November 1), also seems to have been a survival of a heathen celebration.\r\nOn this night witches and fairies were supposed to assemble. Hallow Eve\r\ndoes not appear to have been a season for pranks and jokes, as is its\r\npresent degenerate form. Even the festival of Christmas, coming at the\r\nwinter solstice, kept some heathen features, such as the use of mistletoe\r\nwith which Celtic priests once decked the altars of their gods. The\r\nChristmas tree, however, is not a relic of heathenism. It seems to have\r\ncome into use as late as the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nTHE MORRIS DANCE\r\n\r\nYoung and old took part in the dances which accompanied village festivals.\r\nVery popular in medieval England was the Morris dance. The name, a\r\ncorruption of Moorish, refers to its origin in Spain. The Morris dance was\r\nespecially associated with May Day and was danced round a May pole to a\r\nlively and capering step. The performers represented Robin Hood, Maid\r\nMarian, his wife, Tom the Piper, and other traditional characters. On\r\ntheir garments they wore bells tuned to different notes, so as to sound in\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\nMUMMING\r\n\r\nMumming had a particular association with Christmas. Mummers were bands of\r\nmen and women who disguised themselves in masks and skins of animals and\r\nthen serenaded people outside their houses. Oftentimes the mummers acted\r\nout little plays in which Father Christmas, Old King Cole, and St. George\r\nwere familiar figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUMMERS\r\nFrom a manuscript now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. It was written and\r\nilluminated in the reign of Edward III.]\r\n\r\nMIRACLE PLAYS\r\n\r\nBesides these village amusements, many plays of a religious character came\r\ninto vogue during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The earliest were\r\nthe miracle plays. They presented in dramatic form scenes from the Bible\r\nand stories of the saints or martyrs. The actors at first were priests,\r\nand the stage was the church itself or the churchyard. This religious\r\nsetting did not prevent the introduction of clowns and buffoons. After a\r\ntime the miracle play passed from the clergy to the guilds. All the guilds\r\nof a town usually gave an exhibition once a year. Each guild presented a\r\nsingle scene in the story. An exhibition might last for several days and\r\nhave as many as fifty scenes, beginning at Creation and ending with\r\nDoomsday. [35]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MIRACLE PLAY AT COVENTRY, ENGLAND\r\nThe rude platform on wheels which served as a stage, was drawn by\r\napprentices to the market place. Each guild had its own stage.]\r\n\r\nMORALITY PLAYS\r\n\r\nThe miracle plays were followed by the \"moralities.\" They dealt with the\r\nstruggle between good and evil, rather than with theology. Characters such\r\nas Charity, Faith, Prudence, Riches, Confession, and Death appeared and\r\nenacted a story intended to teach moral lessons. [36] Out of the rude\r\n\"morality\" and its predecessor, the miracle play, has grown the drama of\r\nmodern times.\r\n\r\n\r\n208. MANNERS AND CUSTOMS\r\n\r\nDWELLINGS\r\n\r\nA previous chapter (Chapter XVIII.) described some features of domestic\r\nlife in castle and village during the age of feudalism. In England, where\r\nthe Norman kings discouraged castle building, the manor house formed the\r\nordinary residence of the nobility. Even in Continental Europe many\r\ncastles were gradually made over into manor houses after the cessation of\r\nfeudal warfare. A manor house, however, was only less bare and\r\ninconvenient than a castle. It was still poorly lighted, ill-ventilated,\r\nand in winter scarcely warmed by the open wood fires. Among the\r\nimprovements of the fourteenth century were the building of a fireplace at\r\none or both ends of the manor hall, instead of in the center, and the\r\nsubstitution of glass windows for wooden shutters or oiled paper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANOR HOUSE IN SHROPSHIRE, ENGLAND\r\nBuilt in the twelfth century.]\r\n\r\nFURNITURE\r\n\r\nPeople in the Middle Ages, even the well-to-do, got along with little\r\nfurniture. The great hall of a manor house contained a long dining table,\r\nwith benches used at meals, and a few stools. The family beds often\r\noccupied curtained recesses in the walls, but guests might have to sleep\r\non the floor of the manor hall. Servants often slept in the stables. Few\r\npersons could afford rugs to cover the floor; the poor had to put up with\r\nrushes. Utensils were not numerous, and articles of glass and silver were\r\npractically unknown, except in the houses of the rich. Entries in wills\r\nshow the high value set upon a single spoon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF AN ENGLISH MANOR HOUSE\r\nShows the great hall of a manor house at Penshurst, Kent. The screen with\r\nthe minstrels' gallery over it is seen at the end of the hall, and in the\r\ncenter, the brazier for fire. Built about 1340 A.D.]\r\n\r\nCOSTUME\r\n\r\nThe pictures in old manuscripts give us a good idea of medieval dress.\r\nNaturally it varied with time and place, and according to the social\r\nposition of the wearer. Sometimes laws were passed, without much result,\r\nto regulate the quality, shape, and cost of the costumes to be worn by\r\ndifferent orders of society. The moralists of the age were shocked, then\r\nas now, when tightly fitting garments, which showed the outlines of the\r\nbody, became fashionable. The inconvenience of putting them on led to the\r\nuse of buttons and buttonholes. Women's headdresses were often of\r\nextraordinary height and shape. Not less remarkable were the pointed shoes\r\nworn by men. The points finally got so long that they hindered walking,\r\nunless tied by a ribbon to the knees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COSTUMES OF LADIES DURING THE LATER MIDDLE AGES]\r\n\r\nBEARDS\r\n\r\nThe medieval noble of the twelfth century as a rule went clean shaven. To\r\nwear a beard was regarded as a sign of effeminacy in a man. The Bayeux\r\nTapestry, [37] for instance, shows the Normans mostly clean-shaven, while\r\nthe English wear only moustaches. The introduction of long beards seems to\r\nhave been due to contact with the East during the crusading period.\r\n\r\nBATHS AND BATHING\r\n\r\nRegular bathing was not by any means neglected during the later Middle\r\nAges. In the country districts river, lake, or pool met the needs of\r\npeople used to outdoor life. The hot air and vapor baths of the Byzantines\r\nwere adopted by the Moslems and later, through the Moors and crusaders,\r\nwere made known to western Europe. After the beginning of the thirteenth\r\ncentury few large cities lacked public bathing places.\r\n\r\nFOOD\r\n\r\nMedieval cookbooks show that people of means had all sorts of elaborate\r\nand expensive dishes. Dinner at a nobleman's house might include as many\r\nas ten or twelve courses, mostly meats and game. Such things as hedgehogs,\r\npeacocks, sparrows, and porpoises, which would hardly tempt the modern\r\npalate, were relished. Much use was made of spices in preparing meats and\r\ngravies, and also for flavoring wines. Over-eating was a common vice in\r\nthe Middle Ages, but the open-air life and constant exercise enabled men\r\nand women to digest the huge quantities of food they consumed.\r\n\r\nTABLE ETIQUETTE\r\n\r\nPeople in medieval times had no knives or forks and consequently ate with\r\ntheir fingers. Daggers also were employed to convey food to the mouth.\r\nForks date from the end of the thirteenth century, but were adopted only\r\nslowly. As late as the sixteenth century German preachers condemned their\r\nuse, for, said they, the Lord would not have given us fingers if he had\r\nwanted us to rely on forks. Napkins were another table convenience unknown\r\nin the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nDRINKING\r\n\r\nIn the absence of tea and coffee, ale and beer formed the drink of the\r\ncommon people. The upper classes regaled themselves on costly wines.\r\nDrunkenness was as common and as little reprobated as gluttony. The\r\nmonotony of life in medieval Europe, when the nobles had little to do but\r\nhunt and fight, may partly account for the prevailing inebriety. But\r\ndoubtless in large measure it was a Teutonic characteristic. The Northmen\r\nwere hard drinkers, and of the ancient Germans a Roman writer states that\r\n\"to pass an entire day and night in drinking disgraces no one.\" [38] This\r\nhabit of intoxication survived in medieval Germany, and the Anglo-Saxons\r\nand Danes introduced it into England.\r\n\r\nCENTRAL PERIOD OF THE MIDDLE AGES\r\n\r\nOur survey of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries has now shown us that\r\nthese two hundred years deserve to be called the central period of the\r\nMiddle Ages. When the Arabs had brought the culture of the Orient to Spain\r\nand Sicily, when the Northmen after their wonderful expansion had settled\r\ndown in Normandy, England, and other countries, and when the peoples of\r\nwestern Europe, whether as peaceful pilgrims or as warlike crusaders, had\r\nvisited Constantinople and the Holy Land, men's minds received a wonderful\r\nstimulus. The intellectual life of Europe was \"speeded up,\" and the way\r\nwas prepared for the even more rapid advance of knowledge in the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries, as the Middle Ages passed into modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

MEANING OF THE RENAISSANCE\r\n\r\nLATER PERIOD OF THE MIDDLE AGES\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, covering the later period of the\r\nMiddle Ages, are commonly known as those of the Renaissance. This French\r\nword means Rebirth or Revival. It is a convenient term for all the changes\r\nin society, law, and government, in science, philosophy, and religion, in\r\nliterature and art which gradually transformed medieval civilization into\r\nthat of modern times.\r\n\r\nLIMITS OF THE RENAISSANCE\r\n\r\nThe Renaissance, just because of its transitional character, cannot be\r\nexactly dated. Some Renaissance movements started before 1300 A.D. For\r\ninstance, the study of Roman law, as a substitute for Germanic customs,\r\nbegan toward the close of the eleventh century. The rise of European\r\ncities, with all that they meant for industry and commerce, belonged to\r\nabout the same time. Other Renaissance movements, again, extended beyond\r\n1500 A.D. Among these were the expansion of geographical knowledge,\r\nresulting from the discovery of the New World, and the revolt against the\r\nPapacy, known as the Protestant Reformation. The Middle Ages, in fact,\r\ncame to an end at different times in different fields of human activity.\r\n\r\nORIGINAL HOME OF THE RENAISSANCE\r\n\r\nThe name Renaissance applied, at first, only to the rebirth or revival of\r\nmen's interest in the literature and art of classical antiquity. Italy was\r\nthe original home of this Renaissance. There it first appeared, there it\r\nfound widest acceptance, and there it reached its highest development.\r\nFrom Italy the Renaissance gradually spread beyond the Alps, until it had\r\nmade the round of western Europe.\r\n\r\nITALIAN CITIES OF THE RENAISSANCE\r\n\r\nItaly, at the beginning of the fourteenth century, was a land particularly\r\nfavorable to the growth of learning and the arts. In northern Italy the\r\ngreat cities of Milan, Pisa, Genoa, Florence, Venice, and many others had\r\nearly succeeded in throwing off their feudal burdens and had become\r\nindependent, self-governing communities. Democracy flourished in them, as\r\nin the old Greek city-states. Noble birth counted for little; a man of\r\nability and ambition might rise to any place. The fierce party conflicts\r\nwithin their walls stimulated mental activity and helped to make life\r\nfull, varied, and intense. Their widespread trade and thriving\r\nmanufactures made them prosperous. Wealth brought leisure, bred a taste\r\nfor luxury and the refinements of life, and gave means for the\r\ngratification of that taste. People wanted to have about them beautiful\r\npictures, statuary, furniture, palaces, and churches; and they rewarded\r\nrichly the artists who could produce such things. It is not without\r\nsignificance that the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance was\r\ndemocratic, industrial, and wealthy Florence. [2]\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE CLASSIC TRADITION\r\n\r\nItaly enjoyed another advantage over the other European countries in its\r\nnearness to Rome. Admiration for the ancient Roman civilization, as\r\nexpressed in literature, art, and law, was felt by all Italians. Wherever\r\nthey looked, they were reminded of the great past which once had been\r\ntheirs. Nor was the inheritance of Greece wholly lost. Greek traders and\r\nthe descendants of Greek colonists in Italy still used their ancient\r\nlanguage; all through the medieval centuries there were Italians who\r\nstudied Greek. The classic tradition thus survived in Italy and defied\r\noblivion.\r\n\r\nBYZANTINE, ARABIC, AND NORMAN INFLUENCE\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages Italy formed a meeting place of several civilizations.\r\nByzantine influence was felt both in the north and in the south. The\r\nconquest of Sicily by the Arabs made the Italians familiar with the\r\nscience, art, and poetry of this cultivated people. After the Normans had\r\nestablished themselves in southern Italy and Sicily, they in turn\r\ndeveloped a brilliant civilization. [3] From all these sources flowed\r\nstreams of cultural influence which united in the Renaissance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GHIBERTI'S BRONZE DOORS AT FLORENCE\r\nThe second or northern pair of bronze doors of the baptistery at Florence.\r\nCompleted by Lorenzo Ghiberti in 1452 A.D. after twenty seven years of\r\nlabor The ten panels represent scenes from Old Testament history.\r\nMichelangelo pronounced these magnificent creations worthy to be the gates\r\nof paradise.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST.

It is the largest church in the world. The central aisle,\r\nnave, and choir measure about 600 feet in length, the great dome, 140 feet\r\nin diameter, rises to a height of more than 400 feet. A double colonnade\r\nencircles the piazza in front of the church. The Vatican is seen to the\r\nright of St Peter's.]\r\n\r\n\r\n210. REVIVAL OF LEARNING IN ITALY\r\n\r\nTHE CLASSICS IN THE MIDDLE AGES\r\n\r\nThe literature of Greece and Rome did not entirely disappear in western\r\nEurope after the Germanic invasions. The monastery and cathedral schools\r\nof the Middle Ages had nourished devoted students of ancient books. The\r\nBenedictine monks labored zealously in copying the works of pagan as well\r\nas Christian authors. The rise of universities made it possible for the\r\nstudent to pursue a fairly extended course in Latin literature at more\r\nthan one institution of learning. Greek literature, however, was little\r\nknown in the West. The poems of Homer were read only in a brief Latin\r\nsummary, and even Aristotle's writings were studied in Latin translations.\r\n\r\nDANTE ALIGHIERI 1265-1321 A.D.\r\n\r\nReverence for the classics finds constant expression in the writings of\r\nthe Italian poet Dante. He was a native of Florence, but passed much of\r\nhis life in exile. Dante's most famous work, the _Divine Comedy_,\r\ndescribes an imaginary visit to the other world. Vergil guides him through\r\nthe realms of Hell and Purgatory until he meets his lady Beatrice, the\r\npersonification of love and purity, who conducts him through Paradise. The\r\n_Divine Comedy_ gives in artistic verse an epitome of all that medieval\r\nmen knew and hoped and felt: it is a mirror of the Middle Ages. At the\r\nsame time it drew much of its inspiration from Graeco-Roman sources.\r\nAthens, for Dante, is the \"hearth from which all knowledge glows\"; Homer\r\nis the \"loftiest of poets\", and Aristotle is the \"master of those who\r\nknow.\" This feeling for classical antiquity entitles Dante to rank as a\r\nprophet of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DANTE ALIGHIERI\r\nFrom a fresco, somewhat restored, ascribed to the contemporary artist,\r\nGiotto. In the National Museum, Florence.]\r\n\r\nDANTE AND THE ITALIAN LEAGUE\r\n\r\nDante exerted a noteworthy influence on the Italian language. He wrote the\r\n_Divine Comedy_, not in Latin, but in the vernacular Italian as spoken in\r\nFlorence. The popularity of this work helped to give currency to the\r\nFlorentine dialect, and in time it became the literary language of Italy.\r\nItalian was the first of the Romance tongues to assume a national\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nPETRARCH, 1304-1374 A.D.\r\n\r\nPetrarch, a younger contemporary of Dante, and like him a native of\r\nFlorence, has been called the first modern scholar and man of letters. He\r\ndevoted himself with tireless energy to classical studies. Writing to a\r\nfriend, Petrarch declares that he has read Vergil, Horace, Livy, and\r\nCicero, \"not once, but a thousand times, not cursorily but studiously and\r\nintently, bringing to them the best powers of my mind. I tasted in the\r\nmorning and digested at night. I quaffed as a boy, to ruminate as an old\r\nman. These works have become so familiar to me that they cling not to my\r\nmemory merely, but to the very marrow of my bones.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETRARCH\r\nFrom a miniature in the Laurentian Library, Florence]\r\n\r\nPETRARCH AS A LATIN REVIVALIST\r\n\r\nPetrarch himself composed many Latin works and did much to spread a\r\nknowledge of Latin authors. He traveled widely in Italy, France, and other\r\ncountries, searching everywhere for ancient manuscripts. When he found in\r\none place two lost orations of Cicero and in another place a collection of\r\nCicero's letters, he was transported with delight. He kept copyists in his\r\nhouse, at times as many as four, busily making transcripts of the\r\nmanuscripts that he had discovered or borrowed. Petrarch knew almost no\r\nGreek. His copy of Homer, it is said, he often kissed, though he could not\r\nread it.\r\n\r\nBOCCACCIO, 1313-1375 A.D.\r\n\r\nPetrarch's friend and disciple, Boccaccio, was the first to bring to Italy\r\nmanuscripts of the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_. Having learned some Greek,\r\nhe wrote out a translation of those epic poems. But Boccaccio's fame to-\r\nday rests on the _Decameron_. It is a collection of one hundred stories\r\nwritten in Italian. They are supposed to be told by a merry company of men\r\nand women, who, during a plague at Florence, have retired to a villa in\r\nthe country. The _Decameron_ is the first important work in Italian prose.\r\nMany English writers, notably Chaucer in his _Canterbury Tales_ [4] have\r\ngone to it for ideas and plots. The modern short story may be said to date\r\nfrom Boccaccio.\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF GREEK IN ITALY\r\n\r\nThe renewed interest in Latin literature, due to Petrarch, Boccaccio, and\r\nothers, was followed in the fifteenth century by the revival of Greek\r\nliterature. In 1396 A.D. Chrysoloras, a scholar from Constantinople, began\r\nto lecture on Greek in the university of Florence. He afterwards taught in\r\nother Italian cities and further aided the growth of Hellenic studies by\r\npreparing a Greek grammar--the first book of its kind. From this time, and\r\nespecially after the fall of Constantinople in 1453 A.D., many learned\r\nGreeks came to Italy, thus transplanting in the West the culture of the\r\nEast. \"Greece had not perished, but had emigrated to Italy.\"\r\n\r\nHUMANISM\r\n\r\nTo the scholars of the fifteenth century the classics opened up a new\r\nworld of thought and fancy. They were delighted by the fresh, original,\r\nand human ideas which they discovered in the pages of Homer, Plato,\r\nCicero, Horace, and Tacitus. Their new enthusiasm for the classics came to\r\nbe known as humanism, [5] or culture. The Greek and Latin languages and\r\nliteratures were henceforth the \"humanities,\" as distinguished from the\r\nold scholastic philosophy and theology.\r\n\r\nSPREAD OF HUMANISM IN ITALY\r\n\r\nFrom Florence, as from a second Athens, humanism spread throughout Italy.\r\nAt Milan and Venice, at Rome and Naples, men fell to poring over the\r\nclassics. A special feature of the age was the recovery of ancient\r\nmanuscripts from monasteries and cathedrals, where they had often lain\r\nneglected and blackened with the dust of ages. Nearly all the Latin works\r\nnow extant were brought to light by the middle of the fifteenth century.\r\nBut it was not enough to recover the manuscripts: they had to be safely\r\nstored and made accessible to students. So libraries were established,\r\nprofessorships of the ancient languages were endowed, and scholars were\r\ngiven opportunities to pursue their researches. Even the popes shared in\r\nthis zeal for humanism. One of them founded the Vatican Library at Rome,\r\nwhich has the most valuable collection of manuscripts in the world. At\r\nFlorence the wealthy family of the Medici vied with the popes in the\r\npatronage of the new learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n211. PAPER AND PRINTING\r\n\r\nPRINTED BOOKS\r\n\r\nThe revival of learning was greatly hastened when printed books took the\r\nplace of manuscripts laboriously copied by hand. Printing is a complicated\r\nprocess, and many centuries were required to bring it to perfection. Both\r\npaper and movable type had to be invented.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION OF PAPER\r\n\r\nThe Chinese at a remote period made paper from some fibrous material. The\r\nArabs seem to have been the first to make linen paper out of flax and\r\nrags. The manufacture of paper in Europe was first established by the\r\nMoors in Spain. The Arab occupation of Sicily introduced the art into\r\nItaly. Paper found a ready sale in Europe, because papyrus and parchment,\r\nwhich the ancients had used as writing materials, were both expensive and\r\nheavy. Men now had a material moderate in price, durable, and one that\r\nwould easily receive the impression of movable type.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF MOVABLE TYPE\r\n\r\nThe first step in the development of printing was the use of engraved\r\nblocks. Single letters, separate words, and sometimes entire pages of text\r\nwere cut in hard wood or copper. When inked and applied to writing\r\nmaterial, they left a clear impression. The second step was to cast the\r\nletters in separate pieces of metal, all of the same height and thickness.\r\nThese could then be arranged in any desired way for printing.\r\n\r\nGUTENBERG\r\n\r\nMovable type had been used for centuries by the Chinese, Japanese, and\r\nKoreans in the East, and in Europe several printers have been credited\r\nwith their invention. A German, Johann Gutenberg of Mainz, set up the\r\nfirst printing press with movable type about 1450 A.D., and from it issued\r\nthe first printed book. This was a Latin translation of the Bible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EARLY PRINTING PRESS\r\nEnlarged from the printer's mark of I. B. Ascensius. Used on the title\r\npages of books printed by him, 1507-1535 A.D.]\r\n\r\nALDUS AND CAXTON\r\n\r\nThe new art quickly spread throughout Christian Europe. It met an\r\nespecially warm welcome in Italy, where people felt so keen a desire for\r\nreading and instruction. By the end of the fifteenth century Venice alone\r\nhad more than two hundred printing presses. Here Aldus Manutius maintained\r\na famous establishment for printing Greek and Latin classics. In 1476 A.D.\r\nthe English printer, William Caxton, set up his wooden presses within the\r\nprecincts of Westminster Abbey. To him we owe editions of Chaucer's poems,\r\nSir Thomas Malory's _Morte d'Arthur_, [6] _Aesop's Fables_, and many other\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nINCUNABULA\r\n\r\nThe books printed in the fifteenth century go by the name of _incunabula_.\r\n[7] Of the seven or eight million volumes which appeared before 1500 A.D.,\r\nabout thirty thousand are believed to be still in existence. Many of these\r\nearliest books were printed in heavy, \"black letter\" type, an imitation of\r\nthe characters used in monkish manuscripts. It is still retained for most\r\nbooks printed in Germany. The clearer and neater \"Roman\" characters,\r\nresembling the letters employed for ancient Roman inscriptions, came into\r\nuse in southern Europe and England. The Aldine press at Venice also\r\ndevised \"italic\" type, said to be modeled after Petrarch's handwriting, to\r\nenable the publisher to crowd more words on a page.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FACSIMILE OF PART OF CAXTON'S \"AENEID\" (REDUCED)\r\nWith the same passage in modern type: Thenne beganne agayne the bataylle\r\nof the one parte/And of the other Eneas ascryed to theym and sayd. Lordes\r\nwhy doo ye fyghte/ Ye knowe well that the couuenante ys deuysed and\r\nmade/That Turnus and I shall fyghte for you alle/]\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF PRINTING\r\n\r\nThe invention of printing has been called the greatest event in history.\r\nThe statement is hardly too strong. It is easy to see that printing\r\nimmensely increased the supply of books. A hardworking copyist might\r\nproduce, at the most, only a few volumes a year; a printing press could\r\nstrike them off by the thousands. Not only more books, but also more\r\naccurate books, could be produced by printing. The old-time copyist,\r\nhowever skilful, was sure to make mistakes, sometimes of a serious\r\ncharacter. No two copies of any manuscript were exactly alike. When,\r\nhowever, an entire edition was printed from the same type, mistakes in the\r\ndifferent copies might be entirely eliminated. Furthermore, the invention\r\nof printing destroyed the monopoly of learning possessed by the\r\nuniversities and people of wealth. Books were now the possession of the\r\nmany, not the luxury of the few. Anyone who could read had opened to him\r\nthe gateway of knowledge; he became a citizen, henceforth, of the republic\r\nof letters. Printing, which made possible popular education, public\r\nlibraries, and ultimately cheap newspapers, ranks with gunpowder [8] as an\r\nemancipating force.\r\n\r\n\r\n212. REVIVAL OF ART IN ITALY\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE\r\n\r\nGothic architecture, with its pointed arches, flying buttresses, and\r\ntraceried windows, never struck deep roots in Italy. The architects of the\r\nRenaissance went back to Greek temples and Roman domed buildings for their\r\nmodels, just as the humanists went back to Greek and Latin literature.\r\nLong rows of Ionic or Corinthian columns, spanned by round arches, became\r\nagain the prevailing architectural style. Perhaps the most important\r\naccomplishment of Renaissance builders was the adoption of the dome,\r\ninstead of the vault, for the roofs of churches. The majestic cupola of\r\nSt. Peter's at Rome, [9] which is modeled after the Pantheon, [10] has\r\nbecome the parent of many domed structures in the Old and New World. [11]\r\nArchitects, however, did not limit themselves to churches. The magnificent\r\npalaces of Florence, as well as some of those in Venice, are among the\r\nmonuments of the Renaissance era. Henceforth architecture became more and\r\nmore a secular art.\r\n\r\nSCULPTURE\r\n\r\nThe development of architecture naturally stimulated the other arts.\r\nItalian sculptors began to copy the ancient bas-reliefs and statues\r\npreserved in Rome and other cities. At this time glazed terra cotta came\r\nto be used by sculptors. Another Renaissance art was the casting of bronze\r\ndoors, with panels which represented scenes from the Bible. The beautiful\r\ndoors of the baptistery of Florence were described as \"worthy of being\r\nplaced at the entrance of Paradise.\"\r\n\r\nMICHELANGELO, 1475-1564 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of Renaissance sculptors was Michelangelo. Though a\r\nFlorentine by birth, he lived in Rome and made that city a center of\r\nItalian art. A colossal statue of David, who looks like a Greek athlete,\r\nand another of Moses, seated and holding the table of the law, are among\r\nhis best-known works. Michelangelo also won fame in architecture and\r\npainting. The dome of St. Peter's was finished after his designs. Having\r\nbeen commissioned by one of the popes to decorate the ceiling of the\r\nSistine chapel [12] in the Vatican, he painted a series of scenes which\r\npresented the Biblical story from the Creation to the Flood. These\r\nfrescoes are unequaled for sublimity and power. On the end wall of the\r\nsame chapel Michelangelo produced his fresco of the \"Last Judgment,\" one\r\nof the most famous paintings in the world.\r\n\r\nRISE OF ITALIAN PAINTING\r\n\r\nThe early Italian painters contented themselves, at first, with imitating\r\nByzantine mosaics and enamels. [13] Their work exhibited little knowledge\r\nof human anatomy: faces might be lifelike, but bodies were too slender and\r\nout of proportion. The figures of men and women were posed in stiff and\r\nconventional attitudes. The perspective also was false: objects which the\r\npainter wished to represent in the background were as near as those which\r\nhe wished to represent in the foreground. In the fourteenth century,\r\nhowever, Italian painting abandoned the Byzantine style; achieved beauty\r\nof form, design, and color to an extent hitherto unknown; and became at\r\nlength the supreme art of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF ITALIAN PAINTING\r\n\r\nItalian painting began in the service of the Church and always remained\r\nreligious in character. Artists usually chose subjects from the Bible or\r\nthe lives of the saints. They did not trouble themselves to secure\r\ncorrectness of costume, but represented ancient Jews, Greeks, and Romans\r\nin the garb of Italian gentlemen. Many of their pictures were frescoes,\r\nthat is, the colors were mixed with water and applied to the plaster walls\r\nof churches and palaces. After the process of mixing oils with the colors\r\nwas discovered, pictures on wood or canvas (easel paintings) became\r\ncommon. Renaissance painters excelled in portraiture. They were less\r\nsuccessful with landscapes.\r\n\r\nTHE \"OLD MASTERS\"\r\n\r\nAmong the \"old masters\" of Italian painting four, besides Michelangelo,\r\nstand out with special prominence. Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519 A.D.) was\r\narchitect, sculptor, musician, and engineer, as well as painter. His\r\nfinest work, the \"Last Supper,\" a fresco painting at Milan, is much\r\ndamaged, but fortunately good copies of it exist. Paris has the best of\r\nhis easel pictures--the \"Monna Lisa.\" Leonardo spent four years on it and\r\nthen declared that he could not finish it to his satisfaction. Leonardo's\r\ncontemporary, Raphael (1483-1520 A.D.), died before he was forty, but not\r\nbefore he had produced the \"Sistine Madonna,\" now at Dresden, the\r\n\"Transfiguration,\" in the Vatican Gallery at Rome, and many other famous\r\ncompositions. In Raphael Italian painting reached its zenith. All his\r\nworks are masterpieces. Another artist, the Venetian Titian (1477?-1576\r\nA.D.), painted portraits unsurpassed for glowing color. His \"Assumption of\r\nthe Virgin\" ranks among the greatest pictures in the world. Lastly must be\r\nnoted the exquisite paintings of Correggio (1494-1534 A.D.), among them\r\nthe \"Holy Night\" and the \"Marriage of St. Catherine.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ITALIAN PAINTINGS OF THE RENAISSANCE\r\n  ASSUMPTION OF THE VIRGIN--TITIAN\r\n  SISTINE MADONNA--RAPHAEL\r\n  THE LAST SUPPER--LEONARDO DA VINCI\r\n  MARRIAGE OF ST. CATHERINE--CORREGGIO\r\n  MONNA LISA GIOCONDA--LEONARDO DA VINCI]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLEMISH, DUTCH AND SPANISH PAINTINGS OF THE RENAISSANCE\r\n  THE NIGHTWATCH--REMBRANDT\r\n  DESCENT FROM THE CROSS--RUBENS\r\n  THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION--MURILLO]\r\n\r\nMUSIC\r\n\r\nAnother modern art, that of music, arose in Italy during the Renaissance.\r\nIn the sixteenth century the three-stringed rebeck received a fourth\r\nstring and became the violin, the most expressive of all musical\r\ninstruments. A forerunner of the pianoforte also appeared in the\r\nharpsichord. A papal organist and choir-master, Palestrina (1526-1594\r\nA.D.), was the first of the great composers. He gave music its fitting\r\nplace in worship by composing melodious hymns and masses still sung in\r\nRoman Catholic churches. The oratorio, a religious drama set to music but\r\nwithout action, scenery, or costume, had its beginning at this time. The\r\nopera, however, was little developed until the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n213. REVIVAL OF LEARNING AND ART BEYOND ITALY\r\n\r\nSPREAD OF HUMANISM IN EUROPE\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the fifteenth century fire from the Italian altar was\r\ncarried across the Alps, and a revival of learning began in northern\r\nlands. Italy had led the way by recovering the long-buried treasures of\r\nthe classics and by providing means for their study. Scholars in Germany,\r\nFrance, and England, who now had the aid of the printing press, continued\r\nthe intellectual movement and gave it widespread currency.\r\n\r\nDESIDERIUS ERASMUS 1466(?)-1536 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe foremost humanist of the age was Desiderius Erasmus. Though a native\r\nof Rotterdam in Holland, he lived for a time in Germany, France, England,\r\nand Italy, and died at Basel in Switzerland. His travels and extensive\r\ncorrespondence brought him in contact with most of the leading scholars of\r\nthe day. Erasmus wrote in Latin many works which were read and enjoyed by\r\neducated men. He might be called the first really popular author in\r\nEurope. Like Petrarch, he did much to encourage the humanistic movement by\r\nhis precepts and his example. \"When I have money,\" said this devotee of\r\nthe classics, \"I will first buy Greek books and then clothes.\"\r\n\r\nGREEK TESTAMENT OF ERASMUS\r\n\r\nErasmus performed his most important service as a Biblical critic. In 1516\r\nA.D. he published the New Testament in the original Greek, with a Latin\r\ntranslation and a dedication to the pope. Up to this time the only\r\naccessible edition of the New Testament was the old Latin version known as\r\nthe Vulgate, which St. Jerome had made near the close of the fourth\r\ncentury. By preparing a new and more accurate translation, Erasmus\r\nrevealed the fact that the Vulgate contained many errors. By printing the\r\nGreek text, together with notes which helped to make the meaning clear,\r\nErasmus enabled scholars to discover for themselves just what the New\r\nTestament writers had actually said. [14]\r\n\r\nHUMANISM AND THE REFORMATION\r\n\r\nErasmus as a student of the New Testament carried humanism over into the\r\nreligious field. His friends and associates, especially in Germany,\r\ncontinued his work. \"We are all learning Greek now,\" said Luther, \"in\r\norder to understand the Bible.\" Humanism, by becoming the handmaid of\r\nreligion, thus passed insensibly into the Reformation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DESIDERIUS ERASMUS (Louvre, Paris)\r\nA portrait by the German artist, Hans Holbein the Younger (1497-1543\r\nA.D.). Probably an excellent likeness of Erasmus.]\r\n\r\nTHE ARTISTIC REVIVAL IN EUROPE\r\n\r\nItalian architects found a cordial reception in France, Spain, the\r\nNetherlands, and other countries, where they introduced Renaissance styles\r\nof building and ornamentation. The celebrated palace of the Louvre in\r\nParis, which is used to-day as an art gallery and museum, dates from the\r\nsixteenth century. At this time the French nobles began to replace their\r\nsomber feudal dwellings by elegant country houses. Renaissance sculpture\r\nalso spread beyond Italy throughout Europe. Painters in northern countries\r\nat first followed Italian models, but afterwards produced masterpieces of\r\ntheir own. [15]\r\n\r\n\r\n214. THE RENAISSANCE IN LITERATURE\r\n\r\nHUMANISM AND THE VERNACULAR\r\n\r\nThe renewed interest in classical studies for a time retarded the\r\ndevelopment of national languages and literatures in Europe. To the\r\nhumanists only Latin and Greek seemed worthy of notice. Petrarch, for\r\ninstance, composed in Italian beautiful sonnets which are still much\r\nadmired, but he himself expected to gain literary immortality through his\r\nLatin works. Another Italian humanist went so far as to call Dante \"a poet\r\nfor bakers and cobblers,\" and the _Divine Comedy_ was indeed translated\r\ninto Latin a few years after the author's death.\r\n\r\nTHE VERNACULAR REVIVAL\r\n\r\nBut a return to the vernacular was bound to come. The common people\r\nunderstood little Latin, and Greek not at all. Yet they had learned to\r\nread and they now had the printing press. Before long many books composed\r\nin Italian, Spanish, French, English, and other national languages made\r\ntheir appearance. This revival of the vernacular meant that henceforth\r\nEuropean literature would be more creative and original than was possible\r\nwhen writers merely imitated or translated the classics. The models\r\nprovided by Greece and Rome still continued, however, to furnish\r\ninspiration to men of letters.\r\n\r\nMACHIAVELLI, 1469-1527 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Florentine historian and diplomat, Machiavelli, by his book, _The\r\nPrince_, did much to found the modern science of politics. Machiavelli, as\r\na patriotic Italian, felt infinite distress at the divided condition of\r\nItaly, where numerous petty states were constantly at war. In _The Prince_\r\nhe tried to show how a strong, despotic ruler might set up a national\r\nstate in the peninsula. He thought that such a ruler ought not to be bound\r\nby the ordinary rules of morality. He must often act \"against faith,\r\nagainst charity, against humanity, and against religion.\" The end would\r\njustify the means. Success was everything; morality, nothing. This\r\ndangerous doctrine has received the name of \"Machiavellism\"; it is not yet\r\ndead in European statecraft.\r\n\r\nCERVANTES, 1547-1616 A.D.\r\n\r\nSpain during the sixteenth century gave to the world in Cervantes the only\r\nSpanish writer who has achieved a great reputation outside his own\r\ncountry. Cervantes's masterpiece, _Don Quixote_, seems to have been\r\nintended as a burlesque upon the romances of chivalry once so popular in\r\nEurope. The hero, Don Quixote, attended by his shrewd and faithful squire,\r\nSancho Panza, rides forth to perform deeds of knight-errantry, but meets,\r\ninstead, the most absurd adventures. The work is a vivid picture of\r\nSpanish life. Nobles, priests, monks, traders, farmers, innkeepers,\r\nmuleteers, barbers, beggars--all these pass before our eyes as in a\r\npanorama. _Don Quixote_ immediately became popular, and it is even more\r\nread to-day than it was three centuries ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CERVANTES]\r\n\r\nFROISSART, 1397(?)-1410 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Flemish writer, Froissart, deserves notice as a historian and as one\r\nof the founders of French prose. His _Chronicles_ present an account of\r\nthe fourteenth century, when the age of feudalism was fast drawing to an\r\nend. He admired chivalry and painted it in glowing colors. He liked to\r\ndescribe tournaments, battles, sieges, and feats of arms. Kings and\r\nnobles, knights and squires, are the actors on his stage. Froissart\r\ntraveled in many countries and got much of his information at first hand\r\nfrom those who had made history. Out of what he learned he composed a\r\npicturesque and romantic story, which still captivates the imagination.\r\n\r\nMONTAIGNE, 1533-1593 A.D.\r\n\r\nA very different sort of writer was the Frenchman, Montaigne. He lives to-\r\nday as the author of one hundred and seven essays, very delightful in\r\nstyle and full of wit and wisdom. Montaigne really invented the essay, a\r\nform of literature in which he has had many imitators.\r\n\r\nCHAUCER, 1340(?)-1400 A.D.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey Chaucer, who has been called the \"morning star\" of the English\r\nRenaissance, was a story-teller in verse. His _Canterbury Tales_ are\r\nsupposed to be told by a company of pilgrims, as they journey from London\r\nto the shrine of Thomas Becket at Canterbury. [16] Chaucer describes\r\nfreshly and with unfailing good spirits the life of the middle and upper\r\nclasses. He does not reveal, any more than his contemporary Froissart, the\r\nlabor and sorrows of the down-trodden peasantry. But Chaucer was a true\r\npoet, and his name stands high in England's long roll of men of letters.\r\n\r\nSHAKESPEARE, 1564-1616 A.D.\r\n\r\nThis survey of the national authors of the Renaissance may fitly close\r\nwith William Shakespeare, whose genius transcended national boundaries and\r\nmade him a citizen of all the world. His life is known to us only in\r\nbarest outline. Born at Stratford-on-Avon, of humble parentage, he\r\nattended the village grammar school, where he learned \"small Latin and\r\nless Greek\", went to London as a youth, and became an actor and a\r\nplaywright. He prospered, made money both from his acting and the sale of\r\nhis plays, and at the age of forty-four retired to Stratford for the rest\r\nof his life. Here he died eight years later, and here his grave may still\r\nbe seen in the village church. [17] During his residence in London he\r\nwrote, in whole or in part, thirty-six or thirty-seven dramas, both\r\ntragedies and comedies. They were not collected and published until\r\nseveral years after his death. Shakespeare's plays were read and praised\r\nby his contemporaries, but it has remained for modern men to see in him\r\none who ranks with Homer, Vergil, Dante, and Goethe among the great poets\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE\r\nFrom the copper plate engraved by Martin Droeshout as frontispiece to the\r\nFirst Folio edition of Shakespeare's works in 1623 A.D. In this engraving\r\nthe head is far too large for the body and the dress is out of\r\nperspective. The only other authentic likeness of Shakespeare is the bust\r\nover his grave in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford on Avon]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHAKESPEARE'S BIRTHPLACE, STRATFORD-ON-AVON\r\nThe house in which Shakespeare was born has been much altered in exterior\r\nappearance since the poet's day. The timber framework, the floors, most of\r\nthe interior walls, and the cellars remain, however, substantially\r\nunchanged. The illustration shows the appearance of the house before the\r\nrestoration made in 1857 A.D.]\r\n\r\nPERSONALITY IN RENAISSANCE LITERATURE\r\n\r\nRenaissance poets and prose writers revealed themselves in their books. In\r\nthe same way the sculptors and painters of the Renaissance worked out\r\ntheir own ideas and emotions in their masterpieces. This personal note\r\naffords a sharp contrast to the anonymity of the Middle Ages. We do not\r\nknow the authors of the _Song of Roland_, the _Nibelungenlied_, and\r\n_Reynard the Fox_, any more than we know the builders of the Gothic\r\ncathedrals. Medieval literature subordinated the individual; that of the\r\nRenaissance expressed the sense of individuality and man's interest in\r\nhimself. It was truly \"humanistic.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n215. THE RENAISSANCE IN EDUCATION\r\n\r\nHUMANISM AND EDUCATION\r\n\r\nThe universities of the Middle Ages emphasized scholastic philosophy,\r\nthough in some institutions law and medicine also received much attention.\r\nGreek, of course, was not taught, the vernacular languages of Europe were\r\nnot studied, and neither science nor history enjoyed the esteem of the\r\nlearned. The Renaissance brought about a partial change in this\r\ncurriculum. The classical languages and literatures, after some\r\nopposition, gained an entrance into university courses and displaced\r\nscholastic philosophy as the chief subject of instruction. From the\r\nuniversities the study of the \"humanities\" descended to the lower schools,\r\nwhere they still hold a leading place.\r\n\r\nVITTORINO DA FELTRE, 1378-1446 A.D.\r\n\r\nAn Italian humanist, Vittorino da Feltre, was the pioneer of Renaissance\r\neducation. In his private school at Mantua, the \"House of Delight,\" as it\r\nwas called, Vittorino aimed to develop at the same time the body, mind,\r\nand character of his pupils, so as to fit them to \"serve God in Church and\r\nState.\" Accordingly, he gave much attention to religious instruction and\r\nalso set a high value on athletics. The sixty or seventy young men under\r\nhis care were taught to hunt and fish, to run and jump, to wrestle and\r\nfence, to walk gracefully, and above all things to be temperate. For\r\nintellectual training he depended on the Latin classics as the best means\r\nof introducing students to the literature, art, and philosophy of ancient\r\ntimes. Vittorino's name is not widely known to-day; he left no writings,\r\npreferring, as he said, to live in the lives of his pupils; but there is\r\nscarcely a modern teacher who does not consciously or unconsciously follow\r\nhis methods. More than anyone else, he is responsible for the educational\r\nsystem which has prevailed in Europe almost to the present day.\r\n\r\nA \"CLASSICAL EDUCATION\"\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that the influence of humanism on education was wholly\r\ngood. Henceforth the Greek and Latin languages and literatures became the\r\nchief instruments of culture. Educators neglected the great world of\r\nnature and of human life which lay outside the writings of the ancients.\r\nThis \"bookishness\" formed a real defect of Renaissance systems of\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\nCOMENIUS, 1592-1671 A.D.\r\n\r\nA Moravian bishop named Comenius, who gave his long life almost wholly to\r\nteaching, stands for a reaction against humanistic education. He proposed\r\nthat the vernacular tongues, as well as the classics, should be made\r\nsubjects of study. For this purpose he prepared a reading book, which was\r\ntranslated into a dozen European languages, and even into Arabic, Persian,\r\nand Turkish. Comenius also believed that the curriculum should include the\r\nstudy of geography, world history, and government, and the practice of the\r\nmanual arts. He was one of the first to advocate the teaching of science.\r\nPerhaps his most notable idea was that of a national system of education,\r\nreaching from primary grades to the university. \"Not only,\" he writes,\r\n\"are the children of the rich and noble to be drawn to school, but all\r\nalike, rich and poor, boys and girls, in great towns and small, down to\r\nthe country villages.\" The influence of this Slavic teacher is more and\r\nmore felt in modern systems of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n216. THE SCIENTIFIC RENAISSANCE\r\n\r\nHUMANISM AND SCIENCE\r\n\r\nThe Middle Ages were not by any means ignorant of science, [18] but its\r\nstudy naturally received a great impetus when the Renaissance brought\r\nbefore educated men all that the Greeks and Romans had done in\r\nmathematics, physics, astronomy, medicine, and other subjects. The\r\ninvention of printing also fostered the scientific revival by making it\r\neasy to spread knowledge abroad in every land. The pioneers of Renaissance\r\nscience were Italians, but students in France, England, Germany, and other\r\ncountries soon took up the work of enlightenment.\r\n\r\nCOPERNICUS 1473-1543 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe names of some Renaissance scientists stand as landmarks in the history\r\nof thought. The first place must be given to Copernicus, the founder of\r\nmodern astronomy. He was a Pole, but lived many years in Italy. Patient\r\nstudy and calculation led him to the conclusion that the earth turns upon\r\nits own axis, and, together with the planets, revolves around the sun. The\r\nbook in which he announced this conclusion did not appear until the very\r\nend of his life. A copy of it reached him on his deathbed.\r\n\r\nTHE COPERNICAN THEORY\r\n\r\nMedieval astronomers had generally accepted the Ptolemaic system. [19]\r\nSome students before Copernicus had indeed suggested that the earth and\r\nplanets might rotate about a central sun, but he first gave reasons for\r\nsuch a belief. The new theory met much opposition, not only in the\r\nuniversities, which clung to the time-honored Ptolemaic system, but also\r\namong theologians, who thought that it contradicted many statements in the\r\nBible. Moreover, people could not easily reconcile themselves to the idea\r\nthat the earth, instead of being the center of the universe, is only one\r\nmember of the solar system, that it is, in fact, only a mere speck of\r\ncosmic dust.\r\n\r\nGALILEO, 1564-1642 A.D.\r\n\r\nAn Italian scientist, Galileo, made one of the first telescopes--it was\r\nabout as powerful as an opera glass--and turned it on the heavenly bodies\r\nwith wonderful results. He found the sun moving unmistakably on its axis,\r\nVenus showing phases according to her position in relation to the sun,\r\nJupiter accompanied by revolving moons, or satellites, and the Milky Way\r\ncomposed of a multitude of separate stars. Galileo rightly believed that\r\nthese discoveries confirmed the theory of Copernicus.\r\n\r\nKEPLER, 1571-1630 A.D.\r\n\r\nAnother man of genius, the German Kepler, worked out the mathematical laws\r\nwhich govern the movements of the planets. He made it clear that the\r\nplanets revolve around sun in elliptical instead of circular orbits.\r\nKepler's investigations afterwards led to the discovery of the principle\r\nof gravitation.\r\n\r\nVESALIUS, 1514-1564 A.D., AND HARVEY, 1578-1657 A.D.\r\n\r\nTwo other scientists did epochal work in a field far removed from\r\nastronomy. Vesalius, a Fleming, who studied in Italian medical schools,\r\ngave to the world the first careful description of the human body based on\r\nactual dissection. He was thus the founder of human anatomy. Harvey, an\r\nEnglishman, after observing living animals, announced the discovery of the\r\ncirculation of the blood. He thereby founded human physiology.\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC METHOD\r\n\r\nCopernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Vesalius, Harvey, and their fellow workers\r\nbuilt up the scientific method. In the Middle Ages students had mostly\r\nbeen satisfied to accept what Aristotle and other philosophers had said,\r\nwithout trying to prove their statements. [20] Kepler, for instance, was\r\nthe first to disprove the Aristotelian idea that, as all perfect motion is\r\ncircular, therefore the heavenly bodies must move in circular orbits.\r\nSimilarly, the world had to wait many centuries before Harvey showed\r\nAristotle's error in supposing that the blood arose in the liver, went\r\nthence to the heart, and by the veins was conducted over the body. The new\r\nscientific method rested on observation and experiment. Students learned\r\nat length to take nothing for granted, to set aside all authority, and to\r\ngo straight to nature for their facts. As Lord Bacon, [21] one of\r\nShakespeare's contemporaries and a severe critic of the old scholasticism,\r\ndeclared, \"All depends on keeping the eye steadily fixed upon the facts of\r\nnature, and so receiving their images simply as they are, for God forbid\r\nthat we should give out a dream of our own imagination for a pattern of\r\nthe world.\" Modern science, to which we owe so much, is a product of the\r\nRenaissance.\r\n\r\n\r\n217. THE ECONOMIC RENAISSANCE\r\n\r\nAN ECONOMIC CHANGE\r\n\r\nThus far the Renaissance has been studied as an intellectual and artistic\r\nmovement, which did much to liberate the human mind and brought the Middle\r\nAges to an end in literature, in art, and in science. It is necessary,\r\nhowever, to consider the Renaissance era from another point of view.\r\nDuring this time an economic change of vast significance was taking place\r\nin rural life all over western Europe. We refer to the decline and\r\nultimate extinction of medieval serfdom.\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF SERFDOM\r\n\r\nSerfdom imposed a burden only less heavy than the slavery which it had\r\ndisplaced. The serf, as has been shown, [22] might not leave the manor in\r\nwhich he was born, he might not sell his holdings of land, and, finally,\r\nhe had to give up a large part of his time to work without pay for the\r\nlord of the manor. This system of forced labor was at once unprofitable to\r\nthe lord and irksome to his serfs. After the revival of trade and industry\r\nin the twelfth and thirteenth centuries had brought more money into\r\ncirculation, [23] the lord discovered how much better it was to hire men\r\nto work for him, as he needed them, instead of depending on serfs who\r\nshirked their tasks as far as possible. The latter, in turn, were glad to\r\npay the lord a fixed sum for the use of land, since now they could devote\r\nthemselves entirely to its cultivation. Both parties gained by an\r\narrangement which converted the manorial lord into a landlord and the serf\r\ninto a free tenant-farmer paying rent.\r\n\r\nTHE \"BLACK DEATH\"\r\n\r\nThe emancipation of the peasantry was hastened, strangely enough, as the\r\nresult of perhaps the most terrible calamity that has ever afflicted\r\nmankind. About the middle of the fourteenth century a pestilence of\r\nAsiatic origin, now known to have been the bubonic plague, reached the\r\nWest. [24] The \"Black Death\" so called because among its symptoms were\r\ndark patches all over the body, moved steadily across Europe. The way for\r\nits ravages had been prepared by the unhealthful conditions of ventilation\r\nand drainage in towns and cities. After attacking Greece, Sicily, Italy,\r\nSpain, France, and Germany, the plague entered England in 1349 A.D. and\r\nwithin less than two years swept away probably half the population of that\r\ncountry. The mortality elsewhere was enormous, one estimate setting it as\r\nhigh as twenty-five millions for all Europe.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE \"BLACK DEATH\"\r\n\r\nThe pestilence in England, as in other countries, caused a great scarcity\r\nof labor. For want of hands to bring in the harvest, crops rotted on the\r\nground, while sheep and cattle, with no one to care for them, strayed\r\nthrough the deserted fields. The free peasants who survived demanded and\r\nreceived higher wages. Even the serfs, whose labor was now more valued,\r\nfound themselves in a better position. The lord of a manor, in order to\r\nkeep his laborers, would often allow them to substitute money payments for\r\npersonal services. When the serfs got no concessions, they frequently took\r\nto flight and hired themselves to the highest bidder.\r\n\r\nFIRST STATUTE OF LABORERS, 1351 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe governing classes of England, who at this time were mainly landowners,\r\nbelieved that the workers were taking an unfair advantage of the\r\nsituation. So in 1351 A.D. Parliament passed a law fixing the maximum wage\r\nin different occupations and punishing with imprisonment those who refused\r\nto accept work when it was offered to them. The fact that Parliament had\r\nto reenact this law thirteen times within the next century shows that it\r\ndid not succeed in preventing a general rise of wages. It only exasperated\r\nthe working classes.\r\n\r\nTHE PEASANTS' REBELLION, 1381 A.D.\r\n\r\nA few years after the first Statute of Laborers the restlessness and\r\ndiscontent among the masses led to a serious outbreak. It was one of the\r\nfew attempts at violent revolution which the English working people have\r\nmade. One of the inspirers of the rebellion was a wandering priest named\r\nJohn Ball. He went about preaching that all goods should be held in common\r\nand the distinction between lords and serfs wiped away. \"When Adam delved\r\nand Eve span, who was then the gentleman?\" asked John Ball. Uprisings\r\noccurred in nearly every part of England, but the one in Kent had most\r\nimportance. The rioters marched on London and presented their demands to\r\nthe youthful king, Richard II. He promised to abolish serfdom and to give\r\nthem a free pardon. As soon, however, as Richard had gathered an army, he\r\nput down the revolt by force and hanged John Ball and about a hundred of\r\nhis followers.\r\n\r\nTHE JACQUERIE, 1358 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion in England may be compared with the far more terrible\r\nJacquerie [25] in France, a few years earlier. The French peasants, who\r\nsuffered from feudal oppression and the effects of the Hundred Years' War,\r\nraged through the land, burning the castles and murdering their feudal\r\nlords. The movement had scarcely any reasonable purpose; it was an\r\noutburst of blind passion. The nobles avenged themselves by slaughtering\r\nthe peasants in great numbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RICHARD II\r\nAfter an engraving based on the original in Westminster Abbey. Probably\r\nthe oldest authentic portrait in England.]\r\n\r\nEXTINCTION OF SERFDOM\r\n\r\nThough these first great struggles of labor against capital were failures,\r\nthe emancipation of the peasantry went steadily on throughout the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries. By 1500 A.D. serfdom had virtually\r\ndisappeared in Italy, in most parts of France, and in England. Some less-\r\nfavored countries retained serfdom much longer. Prussian, Austrian, and\r\nRussian serfs did not receive their freedom until the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nCONDITION OF THE PEASANTRY\r\n\r\nThe extinction of serfdom was, of course, a forward step in human freedom,\r\nbut the lot of the English and Continental peasantry long remained\r\nwretched. The poem of _Piers Plowman_, written in the time of Chaucer,\r\nshows the misery of the age and reveals a very different picture than that\r\nof the gay, holiday-making, merry England seen in the _Canterbury Tales_.\r\nOne hundred and fifty years later, the English humanist, Sir Thomas More,\r\na friend of Erasmus, published his _Utopia_ as a protest against social\r\nabuses. _Utopia_, or \"Nowhere,\" is an imaginary country whose inhabitants\r\nchoose their own rulers, hold all property in common, and work only nine\r\nhours a day. In Utopia a public system of education prevails, cruel\r\npunishments are unknown, and every one enjoys complete freedom to worship\r\nGod. This remarkable book, though it pictures an ideal commonwealth,\r\nreally anticipates many social reforms of the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

MEDIEVAL GEOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nTHE GEOGRAPHICAL RENAISSANCE\r\n\r\nThere was also a geographical Renaissance. The revival of the exploring\r\nspirit led to the discovery of ocean routes to the Far East and the\r\nAmericas. In consequence, commerce was vastly stimulated, and two\r\ncontinents, hitherto unknown, were opened up to civilization. The\r\ngeographical Renaissance, which gave man a New World, thus cooperated with\r\nthe other movements of the age in bringing about the transition from\r\nmedieval to modern times.\r\n\r\nMEDIEVAL IGNORANCE OF GEOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nThe Greeks and Romans had become familiar with a large part of Europe and\r\nAsia, but much of their learning was either forgotten or perverted during\r\nthe early Middle Ages. Even the wonderful discoveries of the Northmen in\r\nthe North Atlantic gradually faded from memory. The Arabs, whose conquests\r\nand commerce extended over so much of the Orient, far surpassed the\r\nChristian peoples of Europe in knowledge of the world.\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL MYTHS\r\n\r\nThe alliance of medieval geography with theology led to curious results.\r\nMap makers, relying on a passage in the Old Testament, [2] usually placed\r\nJerusalem in the center of the world. A Scriptural reference to the \"four\r\ncorners of the earth\" [3] was sometimes thought to imply the existence of\r\na rectangular world. From classical sources came stories of monstrous men,\r\none-eyed, headless, or dog-headed, who were supposed to inhabit remote\r\nregions. Equally monstrous animals, such as the unicorn and dragon, [4]\r\nkept them company. Sailors' \"yarns\" must have been responsible for the\r\nbelief that the ocean boiled at the equator and that in the Atlantic--the\r\n\"Sea of Darkness\"--lurked serpents huge enough to sink ships. To the real\r\ndanger of travel by land and water people thus added imaginary terrors.\r\n\r\nTHE COSMAS MAP\r\n\r\nMany maps prepared in the Middle Ages sum up the prevailing knowledge, or\r\nrather ignorance, of the world. One of the earliest specimens that has\r\ncome down to us was made in the sixth century, by Cosmas, an Alexandrian\r\nmonk. It exhibits the earth as a rectangle surrounded by an ocean with\r\nfour deep gulfs. Beyond this ocean lies another world, the seat of\r\nParadise and the place \"where men dwelt before the Flood.\" The rivers\r\nwhich flow from the lakes of Paradise are also shown. Figures holding\r\ntrumpets represent the four winds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEOGRAPHICAL MONSTERS\r\nFrom an early edition of Sir John Mandeville's _Travels_. Shakespeare\r\n(_Othello_, I, iii, 144-145) refers to:\r\n  \"The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads\r\n  Do grow beneath their shoulders.\"]\r\n\r\nTHE HEREFORD MAP\r\n\r\nA map made about seven hundred years later, and now preserved in Hereford\r\nCathedral, shows the earth as a circular disk with the ocean surrounding\r\nit. In the extreme east--that is, at the top--lies Paradise, Jerusalem\r\noccupies the center, and below it comes the Mediterranean, liberally\r\nsupplied with islands. The Black Sea appears as a narrow body of water,\r\nand even the British Isles are strangely distorted to fit the circle. Such\r\na map could have been of little use to travelers; it simply satisfied a\r\nnatural curiosity about the wonders of the world.\r\n\r\nOPENING UP OF ASIA\r\n\r\nThe crusades, more than anything else, first extended geographical\r\nknowledge. As a religious movement they led to pilgrimages and missions in\r\nOriental lands. With the pilgrims and missionaries went hard-headed\r\ntraders, who brought back to Europe the wealth of the East. The result, by\r\n1300 A.D., was to open up countries beyond the Euphrates which had\r\nremained sealed to Europe for centuries. This discovery of the interior of\r\nAsia had only less importance than that of the New World two centuries\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nLEGEND OF PRESTER JOHN\r\n\r\nWhat specially drew explorers eastward was the belief that somewhere in\r\nthe center of Asia existed a great Christian kingdom which, if allied to\r\nEuropean Christendom, might attack the Moslems from the rear. According to\r\none form of the story the kingdom consisted of the Ten Tribes of Israel,\r\n[5] who had been converted to Christianity by Nestorian missionaries. [6]\r\nOver them reigned a priest-king named Prester (or Presbyter) John. The\r\npopes made several attempts to communicate with this mythical ruler. In\r\nthe thirteenth century, however, Franciscan friars did penetrate to the\r\nheart of Asia. They returned to Europe with marvelous tales of the wealth\r\nand splendor of the East under the Mongol emperors.\r\n\r\nTHE POLOS IN THE EAST, 1271-1295 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of all medieval travelers were Nicolo and Maffeo Polo, and\r\nNicolo's son, Marco. These Venetian merchants set out for Asia in 1271\r\nA.D., and after an adventurous journey reached the court of Kublai Khan at\r\nPeking. [7] The Mongol ruler, who seems to have been anxious to introduce\r\nChristianity and European culture among his people, received them in a\r\nfriendly manner, and they amassed much wealth by trade. Marco entered the\r\nkhan's service and went on several expeditions to distant parts of the\r\nMongol realm. Many years passed before Kublai would allow his useful\r\nguests to return to Europe. They sailed at length from Zaitun, a Chinese\r\nseaport, skirted the coast of southeastern Asia and India, and then made\r\ntheir way overland to the Mediterranean. When the travelers reached Venice\r\nafter an absence of twenty-four years, their relatives were slow to\r\nrecognize in them the long-lost Polos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE DURING THE MIDDLE AGES\r\n  THE WORLD ACCORDING TO COSMAS INDICOPLEUSTES, 535 A.D.\r\n  THE HEREFORD MAP, 1280 A.D.]\r\n\r\nMARCO POLO'S BOOK\r\n\r\nThe story of the Polos, as written down at Marco's dictation, became one\r\nof the most popular works of the Middle Ages. In this book Europe read of\r\nfar Cathay (China), with its wealth, its huge cities, and swarming\r\npopulation, of mysterious and secluded Tibet, of Burma, Siam, and Cochin-\r\nChina, with their palaces and pagodas, of the East Indies, famed for\r\nspices, of Ceylon, abounding in pearls, and of India, little known since\r\nthe days of Alexander the Great. Even Cipango (Japan) Marco described from\r\nhearsay as an island whose people were white, civilized, and so rich in\r\ngold that the royal palace was roofed and paved with that metal. The\r\naccounts of these countries naturally made Europeans more eager than ever\r\nto reach the East.\r\n\r\n\r\n219. AIDS TO EXPLORATION\r\n\r\nTHE COMPASS\r\n\r\nThe new knowledge gained by European peoples about the land routes of Asia\r\nwas accompanied by much progress in the art of ocean navigation. First in\r\nimportance came the compass to guide explorers across the waters of the\r\nworld. The Chinese appear to have discovered that a needle, when rubbed\r\nwith a lodestone, has the mysterious power of pointing to the north. The\r\nArabs may have introduced this rude form of the compass among\r\nMediterranean sailors. The instrument, improved by being balanced on a\r\npivot so that it would not be affected by choppy seas, seems to have been\r\ngenerally used by Europeans as early as the thirteenth century. It greatly\r\naided sailors by enabling them to find their bearings in murky weather and\r\non starless nights. The compass, though useful, was not indispensable;\r\nwithout its help the Northmen had made their distant expeditions in the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nNAUTICAL INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\nThe astrolabe, which the Greeks had invented and used for astronomical\r\npurposes, also came into Europe through the Arabs. It was employed to\r\ncalculate latitudes by observation of the height of the sun above the\r\nhorizon. Other instruments that found a place on shipboard were the hour-\r\nglass, minute-glass, and sun-dial. A rude form of the log was used as a\r\nmeans of estimating the speed of a vessel, and so of finding roughly the\r\nlongitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ASTROLABE]\r\n\r\nOTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN NAVIGATION\r\n\r\nDuring the last centuries of the Middle Ages the charting of coasts became\r\na science. A sailor might rely on the \"handy maps\" (_portolani_) which\r\noutlined with some approach to accuracy the bays, islands, and headlands\r\nof the Mediterranean and adjacent waters. Manuals were prepared telling\r\nthe manner about the tides, currents, and other features of the route he\r\nintended to follow. The increase in size of ships made navigation safer\r\nand permitted the storage of bulky cargoes. For long voyages the sailing\r\nvessel replaced the medieval galley rowed by oars. As the result of all\r\nthese improvements navigators no longer found it necessary to keep close\r\nto the shore, but could push out dauntlessly into the open sea.\r\n\r\nMOTIVES FOR EXPLORATION\r\n\r\nMany motives prompted exploration. Scientific curiosity, bred of the\r\nRenaissance spirit of free inquiry, led men to set forth on voyages of\r\ndiscovery. The crusading spirit, which had not died out in Europe,\r\nthrilled at the thought of spreading Christianity among heathen peoples.\r\nAnd in this age, as in all epochs of exploration, adventurers sought in\r\ndistant lands opportunities to acquire wealth and fame and power.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMERCIAL MOTIVE\r\n\r\nCommerce formed perhaps the most powerful motive for exploration. Eastern\r\nspices--cinnamon, pepper, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger--were used more\r\nfreely in medieval times than now, when people lived on salt meat during\r\nthe winter and salt fish during Lent. Even wine, ale, and medicines had a\r\nseasoning of spices. When John Ball [8] wished to contrast the easy life\r\nof the lords with the peasants' hard lot, he said, \"They have wines,\r\nspices, and fine bread, while we have only rye and the refuse of the\r\nstraw.\" [9] Besides spices, all kinds of precious stones, drugs, perfumes,\r\ngums, dyes, and fragrant woods came from the East. Since the time of the\r\ncrusades these luxuries, after having been brought overland by water to\r\nMediterranean ports, had been distributed by Venetian and Genoese\r\nmerchants throughout Europe. [10] But now in the fifteenth century two\r\nother European peoples--the Portuguese and Spaniards--appeared as\r\ncompetitors for this Oriental trade. Their efforts to break through the\r\nmonopoly enjoyed by the Italian cities led to the discovery of the sea\r\nroutes to the Indies. The Portuguese were first in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n220. TO THE INDIES EASTWARD: PRINCE HENRY AND DA GAMA\r\n\r\nPRINCE HENRY THE NAVIGATOR, 1394-1460 A.D.\r\n\r\nIn the history of the fifteenth century few names rank higher than that of\r\nPrince Henry, commonly called the Navigator, because of his services to\r\nthe cause of exploration. The son of a Portuguese king, he devoted himself\r\nduring more than forty years to organizing scientific discovery. Under his\r\ndirection better maps were made, the astrolabe was improved, the compass\r\nwas placed on vessels, and seamen were instructed in all the nautical\r\nlearning of the time. The problem which Prince Henry studied and which\r\nPortuguese sailors finally solved was the possibility of a maritime route\r\naround Africa to the Indies.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATION OF THE AFRICAN COAST\r\n\r\nThe expeditions sent out by Prince Henry began by rediscovering the\r\nMadeira and Azores Islands, first visited by Europeans in the fourteenth\r\ncentury. Then the Portuguese turned southward along the unchartered\r\nAfrican coast. In 1445 A.D. they got as far as Cape Verde, or \"Green\r\nCape,\" so called because of its luxuriant vegetation. The discovery was\r\nimportant, for it disposed of the idea that the Sahara desert extended\r\nindefinitely to the south. Sierra Leone, which the Carthaginian Hanno [11]\r\nhad probably visited, was reached in 1462 A.D., two years after Prince\r\nHenry's death. Soon Portuguese sailors found the great bend of the African\r\ncoast formed by the gulf of Guinea. In 1471 A.D. they crossed the equator,\r\nwithout the scorching that some had feared. In 1482 A.D. they were at the\r\nmouth of the Congo. Six years later Bartholomew Diaz rounded the southern\r\nextremity of Africa. The story goes that he named it the Cape of Storms,\r\nand that the king of Portugal, recognizing its importance as a stage on\r\nthe route to the East, rechristened it the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nDA GAMA'S VOYAGE, 1497-1499 A.D.\r\n\r\nA daring mariner, Vasco da Gama, opened the sea-gates to the Indies. With\r\nfour tiny ships he set sail from Lisbon in July, 1497 A.D., and after\r\nleaving the Cape Verde Islands made a wide sweep into the South Atlantic.\r\nFive months passed before Africa was seen again. Having doubled the Cape\r\nof Good Hope in safety, Da Gama skirted the eastern shores of Africa and\r\nat length secured the services of a Moslem pilot to guide him across the\r\nIndian Ocean. In May, 1498 A.D., he reached Calicut, [12] an important\r\ncommercial city on the southwest coast of India. When Da Gama returned to\r\nLisbon, after an absence of over two years, he brought back a cargo which\r\nrepaid sixty times the cost of the expedition. The Portuguese king\r\nreceived him with high honor and created him Admiral of the Indies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VASCO DA GAMA\r\nFrom a manuscript in the British Museum.]\r\n\r\nCAMOENS, 1524-1580 A.D., AND THE LUSIADS\r\n\r\nThe story of Da Gama's memorable voyage was sung by the Portuguese poet,\r\nCamoens, in the _Lusiads_. It is the most successful of all modern epics.\r\nThe popularity of the _Lusiads_ has done much to keep alive the sense of\r\nnationality among the Portuguese, and even to-day it forms a bond of union\r\nbetween Portugal and her daughter-nation across the Atlantic--Brazil.\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE MARITIME ROUTE\r\n\r\nThe discovery of an ocean passage to the East came at the right moment.\r\nJust at this time the Ottoman Turks were beginning to block up the old\r\ntrade routes. [13] Their conquests in Asia Minor and southeastern Europe,\r\nduring the fifteenth century, shut out the Italians from the northern\r\nroute through the Aegean and the Black Sea. After Syria and Egypt were\r\nconquered, early in the sixteenth century, the central and southern routes\r\nalso passed under Turkish control. The Ottoman advance struck a mortal\r\nblow at the prosperity of the Italian cities, which had so long\r\nmonopolized Oriental trade. But the misfortune of Venice and Genoa was the\r\nopportunity of Portugal.\r\n\r\n\r\n221. THE PORTUGUESE COLONIAL EMPIRE\r\n\r\nPORTUGUESE ASCENDANCY IN THE EAST\r\n\r\nAfter Da Gama's voyage the Portuguese made haste to appropriate the wealth\r\nof the Indies. Fleet after fleet was sent out to establish trading\r\nstations upon the coasts of Africa and Asia. The great viceroy,\r\nAlbuquerque, captured the city of Goa and made it the center of the\r\nPortuguese dominions in India. Goa still belongs to Portugal. Albuquerque\r\nalso seized Malacca, at the end of the Malay Peninsula, and Ormuz, at the\r\nentrance to the Persian Gulf. The possession of these strategic points\r\nenabled the Portuguese to control the commerce of the Indian Ocean. They\r\nalso established trading relations with China, through the port of Macao,\r\nand with Japan, which was accidentally discovered in 1542 A.D. By the\r\nmiddle of the sixteenth century they had acquired almost complete\r\nascendancy throughout southern Asia and the adjacent islands. [14]\r\n\r\nPORTUGUESE TRADE MONOPOLY\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese came to the East as the successors of the Arabs, who for\r\ncenturies had carried on an extensive trade in the Indian Ocean. Having\r\ndispossessed the Arabs, the Portuguese took care to shut out all European\r\ntrade competitors. Only their own merchants were allowed to bring goods\r\nfrom the Indies to Europe by the Cape route. For a time this policy made\r\nPortugal very prosperous. Lisbon, the capital, formed the chief depot for\r\nspices and other eastern commodities. The French, English, and Dutch came\r\nthere to buy them and took the place of Italian merchants in distributing\r\nthem throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nCOLLAPSE OF THE PORTUGUESE EMPIRE\r\n\r\nBut the triumph of Portugal was short-lived. This small country, with a\r\npopulation of not more than a million, lacked the strength to defend her\r\nclaims to a monopoly of the Oriental trade. During the seventeenth century\r\nthe French and English broke the power of the Portuguese in India, while\r\nthe Dutch drove them from Ceylon and the East Indies. Though the\r\nPortuguese lost most of their possessions so soon, they deserve a tribute\r\nof admiration for the energy, enthusiasm, and real heroism with which they\r\nbuilt up the first of modern colonial empires.\r\n\r\nEUROPE IN ASIA\r\n\r\nThe new world in the East, thus entered by the Portuguese and later by\r\nother European peoples, was really an old world--rich, populous, and\r\ncivilized. It held out alluring possibilities, not only for trade, but\r\nalso as a field for missionary enterprise. Da Gama and Albuquerque began a\r\nmovement, which still continues, to \"westernize\" Asia by opening it up to\r\nEuropean influence. It remains to be seen, however, whether India, China,\r\nand Japan will allow their ancient culture to be extinguished by that of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n222. TO THE INDIES WESTWARD: COLUMBUS AND MAGELLAN\r\n\r\nTHE GLOBULAR THEORY\r\n\r\nSix years before Vasco da Gama cast anchor in the harbor of Calicut,\r\nanother intrepid sailor, seeking the Indies by a western route,\r\naccidentally discovered America. It does not detract from the glory of\r\nColumbus to show that the way for his discovery had been long in\r\npreparation. In the first place, the theory that the earth was round had\r\nbeen familiar to the Greeks and Romans, and to some learned men even in\r\nthe darkest period of the Middle Ages. By the opening of the thirteenth\r\ncentury it must have been commonly known, for Roger Bacon [15] refers to\r\nit, and Dante, in the _Divine Comedy_, [16] plans his Inferno on the\r\nsupposition of a spherical world. The awakening of interest in Greek\r\nscience, as a result of the Renaissance, naturally called renewed\r\nattention to the statements by ancient geographers. Eratosthenes, [17] for\r\ninstance, had clearly recognized the possibility of reaching India by\r\nsailing westward on the same parallel of latitude. Especially after the\r\nrevival of Ptolemy's [18] works in the fifteenth century, scholars\r\naccepted the globular theory; and they even went so far as to calculate\r\nthe circumference of the earth.\r\n\r\nMYTH OF ATLANTIS\r\n\r\nIn the second place, men had long believed that west of Europe, beyond the\r\nstrait of Gibraltar, lay mysterious lands. This notion first appears in\r\nthe writings of the Greek philosopher, Plato, [19] who repeats an old\r\ntradition concerning Atlantis. According to Plato, Atlantis had been an\r\nisland continental in size, but more than nine thousand years before his\r\ntime it had sunk beneath the sea. Medieval writers accepted this account\r\nas true and found support for it in traditions of other western islands,\r\nsuch as the Isles of the Blest, where Greek heroes went after death, and\r\nthe Welsh Avalon, whither King Arthur, [20] after his last battle, was\r\nborne to heal his wounds. A widespread legend of the Middle Ages also\r\ndescribed the visit made by St. Brandan, an Irish monk, to the \"promised\r\nland of the Saints,\" an earthly paradise far out in the Atlantic. St.\r\nBrandan's Island was marked on early maps, and voyages in search of it\r\nwere sometimes undertaken.\r\n\r\nBEHAIM'S GLOBE\r\n\r\nThe ideas of European geographers in the period just preceding the\r\ndiscovery of America are represented on a map, or rather a globe, which\r\ndates from 1492 A.D. It was made by a German navigator, Martin Behaim, for\r\nhis native city of Nuremberg, where it is still preserved. Behaim shows\r\nthe mythical island of St. Brandan, lying in mid-ocean, and beyond it\r\nJapan (Cipango) and the East Indies. It is clear that he greatly\r\nunderestimated the distance westward between Europe and Asia. The error\r\nwas natural enough, for Ptolemy had reckoned the earth's circumference to\r\nbe about one-sixth less than it is, and Marco Polo had given an\r\nexaggerated idea of the distance to which Asia extended on the east. When\r\nColumbus set out on his voyage, he firmly believed that a journey of four\r\nthousand miles would bring him to Cipango.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEHAIM'S GLOBE\r\nThe outlines of North America and South America do not appear on the\r\noriginal globe.]\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS, 1446(?)-1506 A.D.\r\n\r\nChristopher Columbus was a native of Genoa, where his father followed the\r\nhumble trade of a weaver. He seems to have obtained some knowledge of\r\nastronomy and geography as a student in the university of Pavia, but at an\r\nearly age he became a sailor. Columbus knew the Mediterranean by heart; he\r\nonce went to the Guinea coast; and he may have visited Iceland. He settled\r\nat Lisbon as a map-maker and married a daughter of one of Prince Henry's\r\nsea-captains. As Columbus pored over his maps and charts and talked with\r\nseamen about their voyages, the idea came to him that much of the world\r\nremained undiscovered and that the distant East could be reached by a\r\nshorter route than that which led around Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, (Biblioteca Nacional, Madrid)\r\nThe oldest known portrait of Columbus.]\r\n\r\nRESEARCHES OF COLUMBUS\r\n\r\nColumbus was a well-read man, and in Aristotle, Ptolemy, and other ancient\r\nauthorities he found apparent confirmation of his grand idea. Columbus\r\nalso owned a printed copy of Marco Polo's book, and from his comments,\r\nwritten on the margin, we know how interested he was in Polo's statements\r\nreferring to Cathay and Cipango. Furthermore, Columbus brought together\r\nall the information he could get about the fabled islands of the Atlantic.\r\nIf he ever went to Iceland, some vague traditions may have reached him\r\nthere of Norse voyages to Greenland and Vinland. Such hints and rumors\r\nstrengthened his purpose to sail toward the setting sun in quest of the\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ISABELLA]\r\n\r\nFIRST VOYAGE OF COLUMBUS, 1492 A.D.\r\n\r\nAll know the story. How Columbus first laid his plans before the king of\r\nPortugal, only to meet with rebuffs; how he then went to Spain and after\r\nmany discouragements found a patron in Queen Isabella; how with three\r\nsmall ships he set out from Palos, August 3, 1492 A.D.; how after leaving\r\nthe Canaries he sailed week after week over an unknown sea; and how at\r\nlast, on the early morning of October 12, he sighted in the moonlight the\r\nglittering coral strand of one of the Bahama Islands. [21] It was the New\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHIP OF 1492 A.D.]\r\n\r\nSUBSEQUENT VOYAGES OF COLUMBUS\r\n\r\nColumbus made three other voyages to the New World, in the course of which\r\nhe explored the Caribbean Sea, the mouth of the Orinoco River, and the\r\neastern coast of Central America. He lived and died in the belief that he\r\nhad actually reached the mainland of Asia and the realms of the Great Khan\r\nof Cathay. The name West Indies still remains as a testimony to this\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nNAMING OF AMERICA\r\n\r\nThe New World was named for a Florentine navigator, Amerigo Vespucci. [22]\r\nWhile in the Spanish service he made several western voyages and printed\r\nan account of his discovery of the mainland of America in 1497 A.D.\r\nScholars now generally reject his statements, but they found acceptance at\r\nthe time, and it was soon suggested that the new continent should be\r\ncalled America, \"because Americus discovered it.\" The name applied at\r\nfirst only to South America. After it became certain that South America\r\njoined another continent to the north, the name spread over the whole New\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NAME \"AMERICA\"\r\nFacsimile of the passage in the _Cosmographiae Introductio_ (1507), by\r\nMartin Waldseemuller, in which the name \"America\" is proposed for the New\r\nWorld.]\r\n\r\nTHE DEMARCATION LINE, 1493 A.D.\r\n\r\nShortly after the return of Columbus from his first voyage, Pope Alexander\r\nVI, in response to a request by Ferdinand and Isabella, issued a bull\r\ngranting these sovereigns exclusive rights over the newly discovered\r\nlands. In order that the Spanish possessions should be clearly marked off\r\nfrom the Portuguese, the pope laid down an imaginary line of demarcation\r\nin the Atlantic, three hundred miles west of the Azores. All new\r\ndiscoveries west of the line were to belong to Spain; all those east of\r\nit, to Portugal. [23] But this arrangement, which excluded France,\r\nEngland, and other European countries from the New World, could not be\r\nlong maintained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, PORTUGUESE AND SPANISH COLONIAL EMPIRES IN THE\r\nSIXTEENTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\nFERDINAND MAGELLAN, 1480(?)-1521 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe demarcation line had a good deal to do in bringing about the first\r\nvoyage around the globe. So far no one had yet realized the dream of\r\nColumbus to reach the lands of spice and silk by sailing westward.\r\nFerdinand Magellan, formerly one of Albuquerque's lieutenants but now in\r\nthe service of Spain, believed that the Spice Islands lay within the\r\nSpanish sphere of influence and that an all-Spanish route, leading to them\r\nthrough some strait at the southern end of South America, could be\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nCIRCUMNAVIGATION OF THE GLOBE, 1519-1522 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish ruler, Charles V, grandson of the Isabella who had supported\r\nColumbus, looked with favor upon Magellan's ideas and gave him a fleet of\r\nfive vessels for the undertaking. After exploring the east coast of South\r\nAmerica, Magellan came at length to the strait which bears his name.\r\nThrough this channel he sailed boldly and found himself upon an ocean\r\nwhich he called the Pacific, because of its peaceful aspect. Magellan's\r\nsailors now begged him to return, for food was getting scarce, but the\r\nnavigator replied that he would go on, \"if he had to eat the leather off\r\nthe rigging.\" He did go on, for ninety-eight days, until he reached the\r\nLadrone Islands. [24] By a curious chance, in all this long trip across\r\nthe Pacific, Magellan came upon only two islands, both of them\r\nuninhabited. He then proceeded to the Philippines, where he was killed in\r\na fight with the natives. His men, however, managed to reach the Spice\r\nIslands, the goal of the journey. Afterwards a single ship, the\r\n_Victoria_, carried back to Spain the few sailors who had survived the\r\nhardships of a voyage lasting nearly three years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FERDINAND MAGELLAN\r\nFrom a portrait formerly in the Versailles Gallery, Paris.]\r\n\r\nMEANING OF THE CIRCUMNAVIGATION\r\n Magellan's voyage forms a landmark in the history of geography. It proved\r\nthat America, at least on the south, had no connection with Asia; it\r\nshowed the enormous extent of the Pacific Ocean; and it led to the\r\ndiscovery of many large islands in the East Indies. Henceforth men knew of\r\na certainty that the earth was round and in the distance covered by\r\nMagellan they had a rough estimate of its size. The circumnavigation of\r\nthe globe ranks with the discovery of America among the most significant\r\nevents in history. In the company of great explorers Magellan stands\r\nbeside Columbus.\r\n\r\n\r\n223. THE INDIANS\r\n\r\nPEOPLING OF AMERICA\r\n\r\nThe first inhabitants of America probably came from the Old World. At a\r\nremote epoch a land-bridge connected northwest Europe with Greenland, and\r\nIceland still remains a witness to its former existence. Over this bridge\r\nanimals and men may have found their way into the New World. Another\r\nprehistoric route may have led from Asia. Only a narrow strait now\r\nseparates Alaska from Siberia, and the Aleutian Islands form an almost\r\ncomplete series of stepping-stones across the most northerly part of the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN ABORIGINES\r\n\r\nThe natives of America, whom Columbus called Indians, certainly resemble\r\nAsiatics in some physical features, such as the reddish-brown complexion,\r\nthe hair, uniformly black and lank, the high cheek-bones, and short\r\nstature of many tribes. On the other hand, the large, aquiline nose, the\r\nstraight eyes, never oblique, and the tall stature of some tribes are\r\nEuropean traits. It seems safe to conclude that the American aborigines,\r\nwhatever their origin, became thoroughly fused into a composite race\r\nduring long centuries of isolation from the rest of mankind.\r\n\r\nINDIAN CULTURE\r\n\r\nBecause of their isolation the Indians had to work out by themselves many\r\narts, inventions, and discoveries. They spoke over a thousand languages\r\nand dialects; and not one has yet been traced outside of America. Their\r\nimplements consisted of polished stone, occasionally of unsmelted copper,\r\nand in Mexico and Peru, of bronze. They cultivated Indian corn, or maize,\r\nbut lacked the other great cereals. They domesticated the dog and the\r\nllama of the Andes. They lived in clans and tribes, ruled by headmen or\r\nchiefs. Their religion probably did not involve a belief in a \"Great\r\nSpirit,\" as is so often said, but rather recognized in all nature the\r\nabode of spiritual powers, mysterious and wonderful, whom man ought to\r\nconciliate by prayers and sacrifices. In short, most of the American\r\nIndians were not savages, but barbarians well advanced in culture.\r\n\r\nTHE MAYAS\r\n\r\nIndian culture attained its highest development in Mexico and Central\r\nAmerica, especially among the Mayas of Yucatan, Guatemala, and Honduras.\r\nThe remains of their cities--the Ninevehs and Babylons of the New World--\r\nlie buried in the tropical jungle, where Europeans first saw them, four\r\nhundred years ago. The temples, shrines, altars, and statues in these\r\nancient cities show that the Mayas had made much progress in the fine\r\narts. They knew enough astronomy to frame a solar calendar of three\r\nhundred and sixty-five days, and enough mathematics to employ numbers\r\nexceeding a million. The writing of the Mayas had reached the rebus [25]\r\nstage and promised to become alphabetic. When their hieroglyphics have\r\nbeen completely deciphered, we shall learn much more about this gifted\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nTHE AZTECS\r\n\r\nSeveral centuries before the arrival of Europeans in America, the so-\r\ncalled Aztecs came down from the north and established themselves on the\r\nMexican plateau. Here they formed a confederacy of many tribes, ruled over\r\nby a sort of king, whose capital was Tenochtitlan, on the site of the\r\npresent city of Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AZTEC SACRIFICIAL KNIFE\r\nBritish Museum, London.

The handle is of\r\nlight-colored wood carved in the form of a man masked with a bird skin.\r\nBrilliant mosaic settings of turquoise, malachite, and shell embellish the\r\nfigure.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AZTEC SACRIFICIAL STONE\r\nNow in the National Museum in the City of Mexico.]\r\n\r\nAZTEC CULTURE\r\n\r\nThe Aztecs appear to have borrowed much of their art, science, and\r\nknowledge of writing from their Maya neighbors. They built houses and\r\ntemples of stone or sundried brick, constructed aqueducts, roads, and\r\nbridges, excelled in the dyeing, weaving, and spinning of cotton, and made\r\nmost beautiful ornaments of silver and gold. They worshiped many gods, to\r\nwhich the priests offered prisoners of war as human sacrifices. In spite\r\nof these bloody rites, the Aztecs were a kind-hearted, honest people,\r\nrespectful of the rights of property, brave in battle, and obedient to\r\ntheir native rulers. Aztec culture in some ways was scarcely inferior to\r\nthat of the ancient Egyptians.\r\n\r\nTHE INCAS\r\n\r\nThe lofty table-lands of the Andes were also the seat of an advanced\r\nIndian culture. At the time of the Spanish conquest the greater part of\r\nwhat is now Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and northern Chile had come under the\r\nsway of the Incas, the \"people of the sun\". The Inca power centered in the\r\nPeruvian city of Cuzco and on the shores of Lake Titicaca, which lies\r\ntwelve thousand feet above sea-level. In this region of magnificent\r\nscenery the traveler views with astonishment the ruins of vast edifices,\r\napparently never completed, which were raised either by the Incas or the\r\nIndians whom they conquered and displaced. Though the culture of the Incas\r\nresembled in many ways that of the Aztecs, the two peoples probably never\r\nhad any intercourse and hence remained totally unaware of each other's\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, WEST INDIES]\r\n\r\n\r\n224. SPANISH EXPLORATIONS AND CONQUESTS IN AMERICA\r\n\r\nOBJECTS OF THE SPANIARDS\r\n\r\nThe discoverers of the New World were naturally the pioneers in its\r\nexploration. The first object of the Spaniards had been trade with the\r\nIndies, and for a number of years, until Magellan's voyage, they sought\r\nvainly for a passage through the mainland to the Spice Islands. When,\r\nhowever, the Spaniards learned that America was rich in deposits of gold\r\nand silver, these metals formed the principal objects of their\r\nexpeditions.\r\n\r\nPONCE DE LEÓN AND BALBOA, 1513 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards at first had confined their settlements to the Greater\r\nAntilles in the West Indies, [26] but after the gold of these islands was\r\nexhausted, they began to penetrate the mainland. In 1513 A.D. Ponce de\r\nLeón, who had been with Columbus on his second voyage, discovered the\r\ncountry which he named Florida. It became the first Spanish possession in\r\nNorth America. In the same year Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, from the isthmus of\r\nPanama, sighted the Pacific. He entered its waters, sword in hand, and\r\ntook formal possession in the name of the king of Spain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, AN EARLY MAP OF THE NEW WORLD (1540 A.D.)]\r\n\r\nCONQUEST OF MEXICO 1519-1521 A.D. AND PERU 1531-1537 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of the Aztec power was accomplished by Hernando Cortés, with\r\nthe aid of Indian allies. Many large towns and half a thousand villages,\r\ntogether with immense quantities of treasure, fell into the hands of the\r\nconquerors. Henceforth Mexico, or \"New Spain,\" became the most important\r\nSpanish possession in America. Francisco Pizarro, who invaded Peru with a\r\nhandful of soldiers, succeeded in overthrowing the Incas. Pizarro founded\r\nin Peru the city of Lima. It replaced Cuzco as the capital of the country\r\nand formed the seat of the Spanish government in South America.\r\n\r\nEL DORADO\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards, during the earlier part of the sixteenth century, heard\r\nmuch of a fabled king whom they called El Dorado. [27] This king, it was\r\nsaid, used to smear himself with gold dust at an annual religious\r\nceremony. In time the idea arose that somewhere in South America existed a\r\nfabled country marvelously rich in precious metals and gems. These stories\r\nstirred the imagination of the Spaniards, who fitted out many expeditions\r\nto find the gilded man and his gilded realm. The quest for El Dorado\r\nopened up the valleys of the Amazon and Orinoco and the extensive forest\r\nregion east of the Andes. Spanish explorers also tried to find El Dorado\r\nin North America. De Soto's expedition led to the discovery of the\r\nMississippi in 1541 A.D., and Coronado's search for the \"Seven Cities of\r\nCibola\" not only added greatly to geographical knowledge of the Southwest,\r\nbut also resulted in the extension of Spanish dominion over this part of\r\nthe American continent. About 1605 A.D. the Spaniards founded Santa Fé and\r\nmade it the capital of their government in New Mexico.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n225. THE SPANISH COLONIAL EMPIRE\r\n\r\nSPAIN IN THE NEW WORLD\r\n\r\nThe wonderful exploits of the _conquistadores_ (conquerors) laid the\r\nfoundations of the Spanish colonial empire. It included Florida, New\r\nMexico, California, Mexico, Central America, the West Indies, and all\r\nSouth America except Brazil. [28] The rule of Spain over these dominions\r\nlasted nearly three hundred years. During this time she gave her language,\r\nher government, and her religion to half the New World.\r\n\r\nINTERMARRIAGE OF SPANIARDS AND INDIANS\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards brought few women with them and hence had to find their\r\nwives among the Indians. Intermarriage of the two peoples early became\r\ncommon. The result was the mixed race which one still finds throughout the\r\ngreater part of Spanish America. In this race the Indian strain\r\npredominates, because almost everywhere the aborigines were far more\r\nnumerous than the white settlers.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF THE INDIANS\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards treated the Indians of the West Indies most harshly and\r\nforced them to work in gold mines and on sugar plantations. The hard\r\nlabor, to which the Indians were unaccustomed, broke down their health,\r\nand almost the entire native population disappeared within a few years\r\nafter the coming of the whites. This terrible tragedy was not repeated on\r\nthe mainland, for the Spanish government stepped in to preserve the\r\naborigines from destruction. It prohibited their enslavement and gave them\r\nthe protection of humane laws. Though these laws were not always well\r\nenforced, the Indians of Mexico and Peru increased in numbers under\r\nSpanish rule and often became prosperous traders, farmers, and artisans.\r\n\r\nCONVERSION OF THE INDIANS\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards succeeded in winning many of the Indians to Christianity.\r\nDevoted monks penetrated deep into the wilderness and brought to the\r\naborigines, not only the Christian religion, but also European\r\ncivilization. In many places the natives were gathered into permanent\r\nvillages, or \"missions,\" each one with its church and school. Converts who\r\nlearned to read and write often became priests or entered the monastic\r\norders. The monks also took much interest in the material welfare of the\r\nIndians and taught them how to farm, how to build houses, and how to spin\r\nand weave and cook by better methods than their own.\r\n\r\nTHE CALIFORNIA MISSIONS\r\n\r\nThe most familiar examples of the Spanish missions are those in the state\r\nof California. During the last quarter of the eighteenth century\r\nFranciscan friars missions erected no less than eighteen mission stations\r\nalong the Pacific coast from San Diego to San Francisco. The stations were\r\nconnected by the \"King's Road\" [29] which still remains the principal\r\nhighway of the state. Some of the mission buildings now lie in ruins and\r\nothers have entirely disappeared. But such a well-preserved structure as\r\nthe mission of Santa Barbara recalls a Benedictine monastery, [30] with\r\nits shady cloisters, secluded courtyard, and timbered roof covered with\r\nred tiles. It is a bit of the Old World transplanted to the New.\r\n\r\nSPANISH AMERICAN CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nThe civilizing work of Spain in the New World is sometimes forgotten. Here\r\nwere the earliest American hospitals and asylums, for the use of Indians\r\nand negroes as well as of Spaniards. Here were the earliest American\r\nschools and colleges. Twelve institutions of higher learning, all modeled\r\nupon the university of Salamanca, arose in Spanish America during the\r\ncolonial period. Eight of these came into existence before the creation in\r\n1636 A.D. of Harvard University, the oldest in the United States. The\r\npioneer printing press in the Western Hemisphere was set up at Mexico City\r\nin 1535 A.D.; no printing press reached the English colonies till more\r\nthan one hundred years later. To the valuable books by Spanish scholars we\r\nowe much of our knowledge of the Mayas, Aztecs, and other Indian tribes.\r\nThe first American newspaper was published at Mexico City in 1693 A.D. The\r\nfine arts also flourished in the Spanish colonies, and architects of the\r\nUnited States have now begun to copy the beautiful churches and public\r\nbuildings of Mexico and Peru.\r\n\r\nSPANISH COLONIAL POLICY\r\n\r\nThe government of Spain administered its colonial dominions in the spirit\r\nof monopoly. As far as possible it excluded French, English, and other\r\nforeigners from trading with Spanish America. It also discouraged ship-\r\nbuilding, manufacturing, and even the cultivation of the vine and the\r\nolive, lest the colonists should compete with home industries. The\r\ncolonies were regarded only as a workshop for the production of the\r\nprecious metals and raw materials. This unwise policy very largely\r\naccounts for the economic backwardness of Mexico, Peru, and other Spanish-\r\nAmerican countries at the present day. Their rich natural resources have\r\nas yet scarcely begun to be utilized.\r\n\r\n\r\n226. ENGLISH AND FRENCH EXPLORATIONS IN AMERICA\r\n\r\nTHE CABOT VOYAGES, 1497-1498 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe English based their claim to the right to colonize North America on\r\nthe discoveries of John Cabot, an Italian mariner in the service of the\r\nTudor king, Henry VII. [31] In 1497 A.D. Cabot sailed from Bristol across\r\nthe northern Atlantic and made land somewhere between Labrador and Nova\r\nScotia. The following year he seems to have undertaken a second voyage and\r\nto have explored the coast of North America nearly as far as Florida.\r\nCabot, like Columbus, believed he had reached Cathay and the dominions of\r\nthe Great Khan. Because Cabot found neither gold nor opportunities for\r\nprofitable trade, his expeditions were considered a failure, and for a\r\nlong time the English took no further interest in exploring the New World.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CABOT MEMORIAL TOWER\r\nErected at Bristol, England, in memory of John Cabot and his sons. The\r\nfoundation stone was laid on June 24, 1897 A.D., the four-hundredth\r\nanniversary of John Cabot's first sight of the continent of North\r\nAmerica.]\r\n\r\nCARTIER'S VOYAGES, 1534-1542 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe discovery by Magellan of a strait leading into the Pacific aroused\r\nhope that a similar passage, beyond the regions controlled by Spain, might\r\nexist in North America. In 1534 A.D. the French king, Francis I, sent\r\nJacques Cartier to look for it. Cartier found the gulf and river which he\r\nnamed after St. Lawrence, and also tried to establish a settlement near\r\nwhere Quebec now stands. The venture was not successful, and the French\r\ndid not undertake the colonization of Canada till the first decade of the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHWEST PASSAGE\r\n\r\nEnglish sailors also sought a road to India by the so-called Northwest\r\nPassage. It was soon found to be an impossible route, for during half the\r\nyear the seas were frozen and during the other half they were filled with\r\nicebergs. However, the search for the Northwest Passage added much to\r\ngeographical knowledge. The names Frobisher Bay, Davis Strait, and Baffin\r\nLand still preserve the memory of the navigators who first explored the\r\nchannels leading into the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH \"SEA DOGS\"\r\n\r\nWhen the English realized how little profit was to be gained by voyages to\r\nthe cold and desolate north, they turned southward to warmer waters. Here,\r\nof course, they came upon the Spaniards, who had no disposition to share\r\nwith foreigners the profitable trade of the New World. Though England and\r\nSpain were not at war, the English \"sea dogs,\" as they called themselves,\r\ndid not scruple to ravage the Spanish colonies and to capture the huge,\r\nclumsy treasure-ships carrying gold and silver to Spain. The most famous\r\nof the \"sea dogs,\" Sir Francis Drake, was the first Englishman to sail\r\nround the world (1577-1580 A.D.).\r\n\r\nTHE RALEIGH COLONIES, 1584-1590 A.D.\r\n\r\nFour years after Drake had completed his voyage, another English seaman,\r\nSir Walter Raleigh, sent out an expedition to find a good site for a\r\nsettlement in North America. The explorers reached the coast of North\r\nCarolina and returned with glowing accounts of the country, which was\r\nnamed Virginia, in honor of Elizabeth, the \"Virgin Queen.\" But Raleigh's\r\ncolonies in Virginia failed miserably, and the English made no further\r\nattempt to settle there till the reign of James I, early in the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n227. THE OLD WORLD AND THE NEW\r\n\r\nEXPANSION OF EUROPE\r\n\r\nThe New World contained two virgin continents, full of natural resources\r\nand capable in a high degree of colonization. The native peoples,\r\ncomparatively few in number and barbarian in culture, could not offer much\r\nresistance to the explorers, missionaries, traders, and colonists from the\r\nOld World. The Spanish and Portuguese in the sixteenth century, followed\r\nby the French, English, and Dutch in the seventeenth century, repeopled\r\nAmerica and brought to it European civilization. Europe expanded into a\r\nGreater Europe beyond the ocean.\r\n\r\nSHIFTING OF TRADE ROUTES\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages the Mediterranean and the Baltic had been the principal\r\nhighways of commerce. The discovery of America, followed immediately by\r\nthe opening of the Cape route to the Indies, shifted commercial activity\r\nfrom these enclosed seas to the Atlantic Ocean. Venice, Genoa, Hamburg,\r\nLübeck, and Bruges gradually gave way, as trading centers, to Lisbon and\r\nCadiz, Bordeaux and Cherbourg, Antwerp and Amsterdam, London and\r\nLiverpool. One may say, therefore, that the year 1492 A.D. inaugurated the\r\nAtlantic period of European history. The time may come, perhaps even now\r\nit is dawning, when the center of gravity of the commercial world will\r\nshift still farther westward to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nINCREASED PRODUCTION OF THE PRECIOUS METALS\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America revealed to Europeans a new source of the\r\nprecious metals. The Spaniards soon secured large quantities of gold by\r\nplundering the Indians of Mexico and Peru of their stored-up wealth. After\r\nthe discovery in 1545 A.D. of the wonderfully rich silver mines of Potosi\r\nin Bolivia, the output of silver much exceeded that of gold. It is\r\nestimated that by the end of the sixteenth century the American mines had\r\nproduced at least three times as much gold and silver as had been current\r\nin Europe at the beginning of the century.\r\n\r\nCONSEQUENCES OF THE ENLARGED MONEY SUPPLY\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards could not keep this new treasure. Having few industries\r\nthemselves, they were obliged to send it out, as fast as they received it,\r\nin payment for their imports of European goods. Spain acted as a huge\r\nsieve through which the gold and silver of America entered all the\r\ncountries of Europe. Money, now more plentiful, purchased far less than in\r\nformer times; in other words, the prices of all commodities rose, wages\r\nadvanced, and manufacturers and traders had additional capital to use in\r\ntheir undertakings. The Middle Ages had suffered from the lack of\r\nsufficient money with which to do business; [32] from the beginning of\r\nmodern times the world has been better supplied with the indispensable\r\nmedium of exchange.\r\n\r\nNEW COMMODITIES IMPORTED\r\n\r\nBut America was much more than a treasury of the precious metals. Many\r\ncommodities, hitherto unknown, soon found their way from the New World to\r\nthe Old. Among these were maize, the potato, which, when cultivated in\r\nEurope, became the \"bread of the poor,\" chocolate and cocoa made from the\r\nseeds of the cacao tree, Peruvian bark, or quinine, so useful in malarial\r\nfevers, cochineal, the dye-woods of Brazil, and the mahogany of the West\r\nIndies. America also sent large supplies of cane-sugar, molasses, fish,\r\nwhale-oil, and furs. The use of tobacco, which Columbus first observed\r\namong the Indians, spread rapidly over Europe and thence extended to the\r\nrest of the world. All these new American products became common articles\r\nof consumption and so raised the standard of living in European countries.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL EFFECTS OF THE DISCOVERIES\r\n\r\nTo the economic effects of the discoveries must be added their effects on\r\npolitics. The Atlantic Ocean now formed, not only the commercial, but also\r\nthe political center of the world. The Atlantic-facing countries, first\r\nPortugal and Spain, then Holland, France, and England, became the great\r\npowers of Europe. Their trade rivalries and contests for colonial\r\npossessions have been potent causes of European wars for the last four\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE DISCOVERIES ON THOUGHT\r\n\r\nThe sudden disclosure of oceans, islands, and continents, covering one-\r\nthird of the globe, worked a revolution in geographical ideas. The earth\r\nwas found to be far larger than men had supposed it to be, and the\r\nimagination was stirred by the thought of other amazing discoveries which\r\nmight be made. From the sixteenth century to the twentieth the work of\r\nexploration has continued, till now few regions of the world yet remain\r\nunmapped. At the same time came acquaintance with many strange plants,\r\nanimals, and peoples, and so scientific knowledge replaced the quaint\r\nfancies of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE DISCOVERIES UPON RELIGION\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth century in Europe was the age of that revolt against the\r\nRoman Church called the Protestant Reformation. During this period,\r\nhowever, the Church won her victories over the American aborigines. What\r\nshe lost of territory, wealth, and influence in Europe was more than\r\noffset by what she gained in America. Furthermore, the region now occupied\r\nby the United States furnished in the seventeenth century an asylum from\r\nreligious persecution, as was proved when Puritans settled in New England,\r\nRoman Catholics in Maryland, and Quakers in Pennsylvania. The vacant\r\nspaces of America offered plenty of room for all who would worship God in\r\ntheir own way. Thus the New World became a refuge from the intolerance of\r\nthe Old.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n228. DECLINE OF THE PAPACY\r\n\r\nTHE PAPACY IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\nThe Papacy, victorious in the long struggle with the Holy Roman Empire,\r\nreached during the thirteenth century the height of its temporal power.\r\nThe popes at this time were the greatest sovereigns in Europe. They ruled\r\na large part of Italy, had great influence in the affairs of France,\r\nEngland, Spain, and other countries, and in Germany named and deposed\r\nemperors. From their capital at Rome they sent forth their legates to\r\nevery European court and issued the laws binding on western Christendom.\r\n\r\nFRICTION BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE\r\n\r\nThe universal dominion of the Church proved useful and even necessary in\r\nfeudal times, when kings were weak and nobles were strong. The Church of\r\nthe early Middle Ages served as the chief unifying force in Europe. When,\r\nhowever, the kings had repressed feudalism, they took steps to extend\r\ntheir authority over the Church as well. They tried, therefore, to\r\nrestrict the privileges of ecclesiastical courts, to impose taxes on the\r\nclergy, as on their own subjects, and to dictate the appointment of\r\nbishops and abbots to office. This policy naturally led to much friction\r\nbetween popes and kings, between Church and State.\r\n\r\nPONTIFICATE OF BONIFACE VIII, 1294-1303 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Papacy put forth its most extensive claims under Boniface VIII. The\r\ncharacter of these claims is shown by two bulls which he issued. The first\r\nforbade all laymen, under penalty of excommunication, to collect taxes on\r\nChurch lands, and all clergymen to pay them. The second announced in\r\nunmistakable terms both the spiritual and the temporal supremacy of the\r\npopes. \"Submission to the Roman pontiff,\" declared Boniface, \"is\r\naltogether necessary to salvation for every human creature\".\r\n\r\nBONIFACE AND PHILIP THE FAIR\r\n\r\nBoniface had employed the exalted language of Gregory VII in dealing with\r\nHenry IV, but he found an opponent in a monarch more resolute and\r\nresourceful than any Holy Roman Emperor. This was Philip the Fair, [2]\r\nking of France. Philip answered the first bull by refusing to allow any\r\ngold and silver to be exported from France to Italy. The pope, thus\r\ndeprived of valuable revenues, gave way and acknowledged that the French\r\nruler had a limited right to tax the clergy. Another dispute soon arose,\r\nhowever, as the result of Philip's imprisonment and trial of an obnoxious\r\npapal legate. Angered by this action, Boniface prepared to excommunicate\r\nthe king and depose him from the throne. Philip retaliated by calling\r\ntogether the Estates-General and asking their support for the preservation\r\nof the \"ancient liberty of France.\" The nobles, the clergy, and the \"third\r\nestate\" rallied around Philip, accused the pope of heresy and tyranny, and\r\ndeclared that the French king was subject to God alone.\r\n\r\nANAGNI, 1303 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe last act of the drama was soon played. Philip sent his emissaries into\r\nItaly to arrest the pope and bring him to trial before a general council\r\nin France. At Anagni, near Rome, a band of hireling soldiers stormed the\r\npapal palace and made Boniface a prisoner. The citizens of Anagni soon\r\nfreed him, but the shock of the humiliation broke the old man's spirit and\r\nhe died soon afterwards. The poet Dante, in the _Divine Comedy_, [3]\r\nspeaks with awe of the outrage: \"Christ had been again crucified among\r\nrobbers; and the vinegar and gall had been again pressed to his lips\". [4]\r\nThe historian sees in this event the end of the temporal power of the\r\nPapacy.\r\n\r\nTHE \"BABYLONION CAPTIVITY,\" 1309-1377 A.D.\r\n\r\nSoon after the death of Boniface, Philip succeeded in having the\r\narchbishop of Bordeaux chosen as head of the Church. The new pope removed\r\nthe papal court to Avignon, a town just outside the French frontier of\r\nthose days. The popes lived in Avignon for nearly seventy years. This\r\nperiod is usually described as the \"Babylonian Captivity\" of the Church, a\r\nname which recalls the exile of the Jews from their native land. [5] The\r\nlong absence of the popes from Rome lessened their power, and the\r\nsuspicion that they were the mere vassals of the French crown seriously\r\nimpaired the respect in which they had been held.\r\n\r\nTHE \"GREAT SCHISM,\" 1378-1417 A.D.\r\n\r\nFollowing the \"Babylonian Captivity\" came the \"Great Schism.\" Shortly\r\nafter the return of the papal court to Rome, an Italian was elected pope\r\nas Urban VI. The cardinals in the French interest refused to accept him,\r\ndeclared his election void, and named Clement VII as pope. Clement\r\nwithdrew to Avignon, while Urban remained in Rome. Western Christendom\r\ncould not decide which one to obey. Some countries declared for Urban,\r\nwhile other countries accepted Clement. The spectacle of two rival popes,\r\neach holding himself out as the only true successor of St. Peter,\r\ncontinued for about forty years and injured the Papacy more than anything\r\nelse that had happened to it.\r\n\r\nCOUNCIL OF CONSTANCE, 1414-1418 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe schism in western Christendom was finally healed at the Council of\r\nConstance. There were three \"phantom popes\" at this time, but they were\r\nall deposed in favor of a new pontiff, Martin V. The Catholic world now\r\nhad a single head, but it was not easy to revive the old, unquestioning\r\nloyalty to him as God's vicar on earth.\r\n\r\nTHE RENAISSANCE POPES\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Martin V the Papacy became more and more an Italian\r\npower. The popes neglected European politics and gave their chief\r\nattention to the States of the Church. A number of the popes took much\r\ninterest in the Renaissance movement and became its enthusiastic patrons.\r\n[6] They kept up splendid courts, collected manuscripts, paintings, and\r\nstatues, and erected magnificent palaces and churches in Rome. Some\r\nEuropean peoples, especially in Germany, looked askance at such luxury and\r\nbegrudged the heavy taxes which were necessary to support it. This feeling\r\nagainst the papacy also helped to provoke the Reformation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, THE GREAT SCHISM, 1378-1417 A.D.]\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS AGAINST THE CLERGY\r\n\r\nThe worldliness of some of the popes was too often reflected in the lives\r\nof the lesser clergy. Throughout the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth\r\ncenturies the Church encountered much criticism from reformers. Thus, the\r\nfamous humanist, Erasmus, [7] wrote his _Praise of Folly_ to expose the\r\nvices and temporal ambitions of bishops and monks, the foolish\r\nspeculations of theologians, and the excessive reliance which common\r\npeople had on pilgrimages, festivals, relics, and other aids to devotion.\r\nSo great was the demand for this work that it went through twenty-seven\r\nlarge editions during the author's lifetime. Erasmus and others like him\r\nwere loyal sons of the Church, but they believed they could best serve her\r\ninterests by effecting her reform. Some men went further, however, and\r\ndemanded wholesale changes in Catholic belief and worship. These men were\r\nthe heretics.\r\n\r\n\r\n229. HERESIES AND HERETICS\r\n\r\nPERSECUTION OF HERETICS\r\n\r\nDuring the first centuries of our era, when the Christians had formed a\r\nforbidden sect, they claimed toleration on the ground that religious\r\nbelief is voluntary and not something which can be enforced by law. This\r\nview changed after Christianity triumphed in the Roman Empire and enjoyed\r\nthe support, instead of the opposition, of the government. The Church,\r\nbacked by the State, no longer advocated freedom of conscience, but began\r\nto persecute people who held heretical beliefs.\r\n\r\nMEDIEVAL ATTITUDE TOWARD HERESY\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for those who live in an age of religious toleration to\r\nunderstand the horror which heresy inspired in the Middle Ages. A heretic\r\nwas a traitor to the Church, for he denied the doctrines believed to be\r\nessential to salvation. It seemed a Christian duty to compel the heretic\r\nto recant, lest he imperil his eternal welfare. If he persisted in his\r\nimpious course, then the earth ought to be rid of one who was a source of\r\ndanger to the faithful and an enemy of the Almighty.\r\n\r\nPUNISHMENT OF HERESY\r\n\r\nAlthough executions for heresy had occurred as early as the fourth\r\ncentury, [8] for a long time milder penalties were usually inflicted. The\r\nheretic might be exiled, or imprisoned, or deprived of his property and\r\nhis rights as a citizen. The death penalty was seldom invoked by the\r\nChurch before the thirteenth century. Since ecclesiastical law forbade the\r\nChurch to shed blood, the State stepped in to seize the heretic and put\r\nhim to death, most often by fire. We must remember that in medieval times\r\ncruel punishments were imposed for even slight offenses, and hence men saw\r\nnothing wrong in inflicting the worst of punishments for what was believed\r\nto be the worst of crimes.\r\n\r\nTHE ALBIGENSES\r\n\r\nIn spite of all measures of repression heretics were not uncommon during\r\nthe later Middle Ages. Some heretical movements spread over entire\r\ncommunities. The most important was that of the Albigenses, so called from\r\nthe town of Albi in southern France, where many of them lived. Their\r\ndoctrines are not well known, but they seem to have believed in the\r\nexistence of two gods--one good (whose son was Christ), the other evil\r\n(whose son was Satan). The Albigenses even set up a rival church, with its\r\npriests, bishops, and councils.\r\n\r\nCRUSADE AGAINST THE ALBIGENSES, 1209-1229 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe failure of attempts to convert the Albigenses by peaceful means led\r\nthe pope, Innocent III, [9] to preach a crusade against them. Those who\r\nentered upon it were promised the usual privileges of crusaders. [10] A\r\nseries of bloody wars now followed, in the course of which thousands of\r\nmen, women, and children perished. But the Albigensian sect did not\r\nentirely disappear for more than a century, and then only after numberless\r\ntrials and executions for heresy.\r\n\r\nTHE WALDENSES\r\n\r\nThe followers of Peter Waldo, who lived in the twelfth century, made no\r\neffort to set up a new religion in Europe. They objected, however, to\r\ncertain practices of the Church, such as masses for the dead and the\r\nadoration of saints. They also condemned the luxury of the clergy and\r\nurged that Christians should live like the Apostles, charitable and poor.\r\nTo the Waldenses the Bible was a sufficient guide to the religious life,\r\nand so they translated parts of the scriptures and allowed everyone to\r\npreach, without distinction of age, or rank, or sex. The Waldenses spread\r\nthrough many European countries, but being poor and lowly men they did not\r\nexert much influence as reformers. The sect survived severe persecution\r\nand now forms a branch of the Protestant Church in Italy.\r\n\r\nJOHN WYCLIFFE, 1320-1384 A.D.\r\n\r\nBeliefs very similar to those of the Waldenses were entertained by John\r\nWycliffe, (or Wyclif) master of an Oxford college and a popular preacher.\r\nHe, too, appealed from the authority of the Church to the authority of the\r\nBible. With the assistance of two friends Wycliffe produced the first\r\nEnglish translation of the Scriptures. Manuscript copies of the work had a\r\nlarge circulation, until the government suppressed it. Wycliffe was not\r\nmolested in life, but the Council of Constance denounced his teaching and\r\nordered that his bones should be dug up, burned, and cast into a stream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN WYCLIFFE\r\nAfter an old print.]\r\n\r\nTHE LOLLARDS\r\n\r\nWycliffe had organized bands of \"poor priests\" to spread the simple truths\r\nof the Bible through all England. They went out, staff in hand and clad in\r\nlong, russet gowns, and preached to the common people in the English\r\nlanguage, wherever an audience could be found. The Lollards, as Wycliffe's\r\nfollowers were known, not only attacked many beliefs and practices of the\r\nChurch, but also demanded social reforms. For instance, they declared that\r\nall wars were sinful and were but plundering and murdering the poor to win\r\nglory for kings. The Lollards had to endure much persecution for heresy.\r\nNevertheless their work lived on and sowed in England and Scotland the\r\nseeds of the Reformation.\r\n\r\nJOHN HUSS, 1373(?)-1415 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe doctrines of Wycliffe found favor with Anne of Bohemia, wife of King\r\nRichard II, [11] and through her they reached that country. Here they\r\nattracted the attention of John Huss, (or Hus) a distinguished scholar in\r\nthe university of Prague. Wycliffe's writings confirmed Huss in his\r\ncriticism of many doctrines of the Church. He attacked the clergy in\r\nsermons and pamphlets and also objected to the supremacy of the pope. The\r\nsentence of excommunication pronounced against him did not shake his\r\nreforming zeal. Finally Huss was cited to appear before the Council of\r\nConstance, then in session. Relying on the safe conduct given him by the\r\nGerman emperor, Huss appeared before the council, only to be declared\r\nguilty of teaching \"many things evil, scandalous, seditious, and\r\ndangerously heretical.\" The emperor then violated the safe conduct--no\r\npromise made to a heretic was considered binding--and allowed Huss to be\r\nburnt outside the walls of Constance. Thus perished the man who, more than\r\nall others, is regarded as the forerunner of Luther and the Reformation.\r\n\r\nTHE HUSSITE WARS\r\n\r\nThe flames which burned Huss set all Bohemia afire. The Bohemians, a\r\nSlavic people, regarded him as a national hero and made his martyrdom an\r\nexcuse for rebelling against the Holy Roman Empire. The Hussite wars,\r\nwhich followed, thus formed a political rather than a religious struggle.\r\nThe Bohemians did not gain freedom, and their country still remains a\r\nHapsburg possession. But the sense of nationalism is not extinct there,\r\nand Bohemia may some day become an independent state.\r\n\r\n\r\n230. MARTIN LUTHER AND THE BEGINNING OF THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY, 1517-\r\n1522 A.D.\r\n\r\nMARTIN LUTHER, 1483-1546 A.D.\r\n\r\nThough there were many reformers before the Reformation, the beginning of\r\nthat movement is rightly associated with the name of Martin Luther. He was\r\nthe son of a German peasant, who, by industry and frugality, had won a\r\nsmall competence. Thanks to his father's self-sacrifice, Luther enjoyed a\r\ngood education in scholastic philosophy at the university of Erfurt.\r\nHaving taken the degrees of bachelor and master of arts, Luther began to\r\nstudy law, but an acute sense of his sinfulness and a desire to save his\r\nsoul soon drove him into a monastery. There he read the Bible and the\r\nwritings of the Church Fathers and found at last the peace of mind he\r\nsought. A few years later Luther paid a visit to Rome, which opened his\r\neyes to the worldliness and general laxity of life in the capital of the\r\nPapacy. He returned to Germany and became a professor of theology in the\r\nuniversity of Wittenberg, newly founded by Frederick the Wise, elector of\r\nSaxony. Luther's sermons and lectures attracted large audiences, students\r\nbegan to flock to Wittenberg; and the elector grew proud of the rising\r\nyoung teacher who was making his university famous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARTIN LUTHER\r\nAfter a portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger.]\r\n\r\nTETZEL AND INDULGENCES\r\n\r\nBut Luther was soon to emerge from his academic retirement and to become,\r\nquite unintentionally, a reformer. In 1517 A.D. there came into the\r\nneighborhood of Wittenberg a Dominican friar named Tetzel, granting\r\nindulgences for the erection of the new St. Peter's at Rome. [12] An\r\nindulgence, according to the teaching of the Church, formed a remission of\r\nthe temporal punishment, or penance [13] due to sin, if the sinner had\r\nexpressed his repentance and had promised to atone for his misdeeds. It\r\nwas also supposed to free the person who received it from some or all of\r\nhis punishment after death in Purgatory. [14] Indulgences were granted for\r\nparticipation in crusades, pilgrimages, and other good works. Later on\r\nthey were granted for money, which was expected to be applied to some\r\npious purpose. Many of the German princes opposed this method of raising\r\nfunds for the Church, because it took so much money out of their\r\ndominions. Their sale had also been condemned on religious grounds by Huss\r\nand Erasmus.\r\n\r\nPOSTING OF THE NINETY-FIVE THESES, 1517 A.D.\r\n\r\nLuther began his reforming career by an attack upon indulgences. He did\r\nnot deny their usefulness altogether, but pointed out that they lent\r\nthemselves to grave abuses. Common people, who could not understand the\r\nLatin in which they were written, often thought that they wiped away the\r\npenalties of sin, even without true repentance. These criticisms Luther\r\nset forth in ninety-five theses or propositions, which he offered to\r\ndefend against all opponents. In accordance with the custom of medieval\r\nscholars, Luther posted his theses on the door of the church at\r\nWittenberg, where all might see them. They were composed in Latin, but\r\nwere at once translated into German, printed, and spread broadcast over\r\nGermany. Their effect was so great that before long the sale of\r\nindulgences in that country almost ceased.\r\n\r\nBURNING OF THE PAPAL BULL, 1520 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe scholarly critic of indulgences soon passed into an open foe of the\r\nPapacy. Luther found that his theological views bore a close resemblance\r\nto those of Wycliffe and John Huss, yet he refused to give them up as\r\nheretical. Instead, he wrote three bold pamphlets, in one of which he\r\nappealed to the \"Christian nobility of the German nation\" to rally\r\ntogether against Rome. The pope, at first, had paid little attention to\r\nthe controversy about indulgences, declaring it \"a mere squabble of\r\nmonks,\" but he now issued a bull against Luther, ordering him to recant\r\nwithin sixty days or be excommunicated. The papal bull did not frighten\r\nLuther or withdraw from him popular support. He burnt it in the market\r\nsquare of Wittenberg, in the presence of a concourse of students and\r\ntownsfolk. This dramatic answer to the pope deeply stirred all Germany.\r\n\r\nDIET OF WORMS, 1521 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe next scene of the Reformation was staged at Worms, at an important\r\nassembly, or Diet, of the Holy Roman Empire. The Diet summoned Luther to\r\nappear before it for examination, and the emperor, Charles V, gave him a\r\nsafe conduct. Luther's friends, remembering the treatment of Huss, advised\r\nhim not to accept the summons, but he declared that he would enter Worms\r\n\"in the face of the gates of Hell and the powers of the air.\" In the great\r\nhall of the Diet Luther bravely faced the princes, nobles, and clergy of\r\nGermany. He refused to retract anything he had written, unless his\r\nstatements could be shown to contradict the Bible. \"It is neither right\r\nnor safe to act against conscience,\" Luther said. \"God help me. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nLUTHER AT THE WARTBURG, 1521-1522 A.D.\r\n\r\nOnly one thing remained to do with Luther. He was ordered to return to\r\nWittenberg and there await the imperial edict declaring him a heretic and\r\noutlaw. But the elector of Saxony, who feared for Luther's safety, had him\r\ncarried off secretly to the castle of Wartburg. Here Luther remained for\r\nnearly a year, engaged in translating the New Testament into German. There\r\nhad been many earlier translations into German, but Luther's was the first\r\nfrom the Greek original. His version, simple, forcible, and easy to\r\nunderstand, enjoyed wide popularity and helped to fix for Germans the form\r\nof their literary language. Luther afterwards completed a translation of\r\nthe entire Bible, which the printing press multiplied in thousands of\r\ncopies throughout Germany.\r\n\r\nLUTHER'S LEADERSHIP\r\n\r\nThough still under the ban of the empire, Luther left the Wartburg in 1522\r\nA.D. and returned to Wittenberg. He lived here, unmolested, until his\r\ndeath, twenty-four years later. During this time he flooded the country\r\nwith pamphlets, wrote innumerable letters, composed many fine hymns, [15]\r\nand prepared a catechism, \"a right Bible,\" said he, \"for the laity.\" Thus\r\nLuther became the guide and patron of the reformatory movement which he\r\nhad started.\r\n\r\n\r\n231. CHARLES V AND THE SPREAD OF THE GERMAN REFORMATION, 1519-1556 A.D.\r\n\r\nCHARLES V, EMPEROR, 1519-1556 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe young man who as Holy Roman Emperor presided at the Diet of Worms had\r\nassumed the imperial crown only two years previously. A namesake of\r\nCharlemagne, Charles V held sway over dominions even more extensive than\r\nthose which had belonged to the Frankish king. Through his mother, a\r\ndaughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, [16] he inherited Spain, Naples,\r\nSicily, and the Spanish possessions in the New World. Through his father,\r\na son of the emperor Maximilian I, he became ruler of Burgundy and the\r\nNetherlands and also succeeded to the Austrian territories of the\r\nHapsburgs. Charles was thus the most powerful monarch in Europe.\r\n\r\nCHARLES V AND THE LUTHERANS\r\n\r\nCharles, as a devout Roman Catholic, had no sympathy for the Reformation.\r\nAt Worms, on the day following Luther's refusal to recant, the emperor had\r\nexpressed his determination to stake \"all his dominions, his friends, his\r\nbody and blood, his life and soul\" upon the extinction of the Lutheran\r\nheresy. This might have been an easy task, had Charles undertaken it at\r\nonce. But a revolt in Spain, wars with the French king, Francis I, and\r\nconflicts with the Ottoman Turks led to his long absence from Germany and\r\nkept him from proceeding effectively against the Lutherans, until it was\r\ntoo late.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, EUROPE at the Beginning of the Reformation, 1519 A.D.]\r\n\r\nTHE \"REFORMED RELIGION\"\r\n\r\nThe Reformation in Germany appealed to many classes. To patriotic Germans\r\nit seemed a revolt against a foreign power--the Italian Papacy. To men of\r\npious mind it offered the attractions of a simple faith which took the\r\nBible as the rule of life. Worldly-minded princes saw in it an opportunity\r\nto despoil the Church of lands and revenues. For these reasons Luther's\r\nteachings found ready acceptance. Priests married, Luther himself setting\r\nthe example, monks left their monasteries, and the \"Reformed Religion\"\r\ntook the place of Roman Catholicism in most parts of northern and central\r\nGermany. South Germany, however, did not fall away from the pope and has\r\nremained Roman Catholic to the present time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES V\r\nA portrait of the emperor at the age of 48, by the Venetian painter\r\nTitian.]\r\n\r\nTHE PROTESTANTS, 1529 A.D.\r\n\r\nThough Germany had now divided into two religious parties, the legal\r\nposition of Lutheranism remained for a long time in doubt. A Diet held in\r\n1526 A.D. tried to shelve the question by allowing each German state to\r\nconduct its religious affairs as it saw fit. But at the next Diet, three\r\nyears later, a majority of the assembled princes decided that the Edict of\r\nWorms against Luther and his followers should be enforced. The Lutheran\r\nprinces at once issued a vigorous protest against such action. Because of\r\nthis protest those who separated from the Roman Church came to be called\r\nProtestants.\r\n\r\nPEACE OF AUGSBURG, 1555 A.D.\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1546 A.D., the year of Luther's death, that Charles V felt\r\nhis hands free to suppress the rising tide of Protestantism. By this time\r\nthe Lutheran princes had formed a league for mutual protection. Charles\r\nbrought Spanish troops into Germany and tried to break up the league by\r\nforce. Civil war raged till 1555 A.D., when both sides agreed to the Peace\r\nof Augsburg. It was a compromise. The ruler of each state--Germany then\r\ncontained over three hundred states--was to decide whether his subjects\r\nshould be Lutherans or Catholics. Thus the peace by no means established\r\nreligious toleration, since all Germans had to believe as their prince\r\nbelieved. However, it recognized Lutheranism as a legal religion and ended\r\nthe attempts to crush the German Reformation.\r\n\r\nLUTHERANISM IN SCANDINAVIA\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Luther's doctrines spread into Scandinavian lands. The rulers of\r\nDenmark, Norway, and Sweden closed the monasteries and compelled the Roman\r\nCatholic bishops to surrender ecclesiastical property to the crown.\r\nLutheranism became henceforth the official religion of these three\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n232. THE REFORMATION IN SWITZERLAND; ZWINGLI AND CALVIN\r\n\r\nHULDREICH ZWINGLI, 1484-1531 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation in Switzerland began with the work of Zwingli. He was the\r\ncontemporary but not the disciple of Luther. From his pulpit in the\r\ncathedral of Zurich, Zwingli proclaimed the Scriptures as the sole guide\r\nof faith and denied the supremacy of the pope. Many of the Swiss cantons\r\naccepted his teaching and broke away from obedience to Rome. Civil war\r\nsoon followed between Protestants and Roman Catholics, and Zwingli fell in\r\nthe struggle. After his death the two parties made a peace which allowed\r\neach canton to determine its own religion. Switzerland has continued to\r\nthis day to be part Roman Catholic and part Protestant.\r\n\r\nJOHN CALVIN 1509-1564 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants in Switzerland did not remain long without a leader. To\r\nGeneva came in 1536 A.D. a young Frenchman named Calvin. He had just\r\npublished his _Institutes of the Christian Religion_, a work which set\r\nforth in an orderly, logical manner the main principles of Protestant\r\ntheology. Calvin also translated the Bible into French and wrote valuable\r\ncommentaries on nearly all the Scriptural books.\r\n\r\nCALVIN AT GENEVA\r\n\r\nCalvin at Geneva was sometimes called the Protestant pope. During his long\r\nresidence there he governed the people with a rod of iron. There were no\r\nmore festivals, no more theaters, no more dancing, music, and masquerades.\r\nAll the citizens had to attend two sermons on Sunday and to yield at least\r\na lip-assent to the reformer's doctrines. On a few occasions Calvin\r\nproceeded to terrible extremities, as when he caused the Spanish\r\nphysician, Michael Servetus, to be burned to death, because of heretical\r\nviews concerning the Trinity. Nevertheless, Geneva prospered under\r\nCalvin's rule and became a Christian commonwealth, sober and industrious.\r\nThe city still reveres the memory of the man who founded her university\r\nand made her, as it were, the sanctuary of the Reformation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN CALVIN, after an old print.]\r\n\r\nDIFFUSION OF CALVINISM\r\n\r\nCalvin's influence was not confined to Geneva or even to Switzerland. The\r\nmen whom he trained and on whom he set the stamp of his stern, earnest,\r\nGod-fearing character spread Calvinism over a great part of Europe. In\r\nHolland and Scotland it became the prevailing type of Protestantism, and\r\nin France and England it deeply affected the national life. During the\r\nseventeenth century the Puritans carried Calvinism across the sea to New\r\nEngland, where it formed the dominant faith in colonial times.\r\n\r\n\r\n233. THE ENGLISH REFORMATION, 1533-1658 A.D.\r\n\r\nHENRY VIII, KING, 1509-1547 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation in Germany and Switzerland started as a national and\r\npopular movement; in England it began as the act of a despotic sovereign,\r\nHenry VIII. This second Tudor [17] was handsome, athletic, finely\r\neducated, and very able, but he was also selfish, sensual, and cruel. His\r\nfather had created a strong monarchy in England by humbling both\r\nParliament and the nobles. When Henry VIII came to the throne, the only\r\nserious obstacle in the way of royal absolutism was the Roman Church.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY VIII\r\nAfter a portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger.]\r\n\r\nHENRY'S EARLY LOYALTY TO THE PAPACY\r\n\r\nHenry showed himself at first a devoted Catholic. He took an amateur's\r\ninterest in theology and wrote with his own royal pen a book attacking\r\nLuther. The pope rewarded him with the title of \"Defender of the Faith,\" a\r\ntitle which English sovereigns still bear. Henry at this time did not\r\nquestion the authority of the Papacy. He even made his chief adviser\r\nCardinal Wolsey, the most conspicuous churchman in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION FOR THE ENGLISH REFORMATION\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of Henry's reign the Church was still strong in England.\r\nProbably most of the people were sincerely attached to it. Still, the\r\nlabors of Wycliffe and the Lollards had weakened the hold of the Church\r\nupon the masses, while Erasmus and the Oxford scholars who worked with\r\nhim, by their criticism of ecclesiastical abuses, had done much to\r\nundermine its influence with the intellectual classes. In England, as on\r\nthe Continent, the worldliness of the Church prepared the way for the\r\nReformation.\r\n\r\nHENRY AND CATHERINE OF ARAGON\r\n\r\nThe actual separation from Rome arose out of Henry's matrimonial\r\ndifficulties. He had married a Spanish princess, Catherine of Aragon, the\r\naunt of the emperor Charles V and widow of Henry's older brother. The\r\nmarriage required a dispensation [18] from the pope, because canon law\r\nforbade a man to wed his brother's widow. After living happily with\r\nCatherine for eighteen years, Henry suddenly announced his conviction that\r\nthe union was sinful. This, of course, formed simply a pretext for the\r\ndivorce which Henry desired. Of his children by Catherine only a daughter\r\nsurvived, but Henry wished to have a son succeed him on the throne.\r\nMoreover, he had grown tired of Catherine and had fallen in love with Anne\r\nBoleyn, a pretty maid-in-waiting at the court.\r\n\r\nTHE DIVORCE, 1533 A.D.\r\n\r\nAt first Henry tried to secure the pope's consent to the divorce. The pope\r\ndid not like to set aside the dispensation granted by his predecessor, nor\r\ndid he wish to offend the mighty emperor Charles V. Failing to get the\r\npapal sanction, Henry obtained his divorce from an English court presided\r\nover by Thomas Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury. Anne Boleyn was then\r\nproclaimed queen, in defiance of the papal bull of excommunication.\r\n\r\nACT OF SUPREMACY, 1534 A.D.\r\n\r\nHenry's next step was to procure from his subservient Parliament a series\r\nof laws which abolished the pope's authority in England. Of these, the\r\nmost important was the Act of Supremacy. It declared the English king to\r\nbe \"the only supreme head on earth of the Church of England.\" At the same\r\ntime a new treason act imposed the death penalty on anyone who called the\r\nking a \"heretic, schismatic, tyrant, infidel, or usurper.\" The great\r\nmajority of the English people seem to have accepted this new legislation\r\nwithout much objection; those who refused to do so perished on the\r\nscaffold. The most eminent victim was Sir Thomas More, [19] formerly\r\nHenry's Lord Chancellor and distinguished for eloquence and profound\r\nlearning. His execution sent a thrill of horror through Christendom.\r\n\r\nTHE MONASTERIES SUPPRESSED\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the monasteries soon followed the separation from Rome.\r\nHenry declared to Parliament that they deserved to be abolished, because\r\nof the \"slothful and ungodly lives\" led by the inmates. In some instances\r\nthis accusation may have been true, but the real reason for Henry's action\r\nwas his desire to crush the monastic orders, which supported the pope, and\r\nto seize their extensive possessions. The beautiful monasteries were torn\r\ndown and the lands attached to them were sold for the benefit of the crown\r\nor granted to Henry's favorites. The nobles who accepted this monastic\r\nwealth naturally became zealous advocates of Henry's anti-papal policy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUINS OF MELROSE ABBEY\r\nThe little town of Melrose in Scotland contains the ruins of a very\r\nbeautiful monastery church built about the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. The principal part of the present remains is the choir, with\r\nslender shafts, richly-carved capitals, and windows of exquisite stone-\r\ntracery. The beautiful sculptures throughout the church were defaced at\r\nthe time of the Reformation. The heart of Robert Bruce is interred near\r\nthe site of the high altar.]\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF THE REFORMATION UNDER EDWARD VI, 1547-1553 A.D.\r\n\r\nThough Henry VIII had broken with the Papacy, he remained Roman Catholic\r\nin doctrine to the day of his death. Under his successor, Edward VI, the\r\nReformation made rapid progress in England. The young king's guardian\r\nallowed reformers from the Continent to come to England, and the doctrines\r\nof Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin were freely preached there. At this time\r\nall paintings, statuary, wood carvings, and stained glass were removed\r\nfrom church edifices. The use of tapers, incense, and holy water was also\r\ndiscontinued. In order that religious services might be conducted in the\r\nlanguage of the people, Archbishop Cranmer and his co-workers prepared the\r\n_Book of Common Prayer_. It consisted of translations into noble English\r\nof various parts of the old Latin service books. With some changes, it is\r\nstill used in the Church of England and the Protestant Episcopal Church of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nTHE CATHOLIC REACTION UNDER MARY TUDOR, 1553-1558 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe short reign of Mary Tudor, daughter of Catherine of Aragon, was marked\r\nby a temporary setback to the Protestant cause. The queen prevailed on\r\nParliament to secure a reconciliation with Rome. She also married her\r\nRoman Catholic cousin, Philip of Spain, the son of Charles V. Mary now\r\nbegan a severe persecution of the Protestants. It gained for her the\r\nepithet of \"Bloody,\" but it did not succeed in stamping out heresy. Many\r\neminent reformers perished, among them Cranmer, the former archbishop.\r\nMary died childless, after ruling about five years, and the crown passed\r\nto Anne Boleyn's daughter, Elizabeth. Under Elizabeth Anglicanism again\r\nreplaced Roman Catholicism as the religion of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n234. THE PROTESTANT SECTS\r\n\r\nEXTENT OF PROTESTANTISM\r\n\r\nThe Reformation was practically completed before the close of the\r\nsixteenth century. In 1500 A.D. the Roman Church embraced all Europe west\r\nof Russia and the Balkan peninsula. By 1575 A.D. nearly half of its former\r\nsubjects had renounced their allegiance. The greater part of Germany and\r\nSwitzerland and all of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Holland, England, and\r\nScotland became independent of the Papacy. The unity of western\r\nChristendom, which had been preserved throughout the Middle Ages, thus\r\ndisappeared and has not since been revived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, EXTENT OF THE REFORMATION, 1524-1572 A.D.]\r\n\r\nCOMMON FEATURES OF PROTESTANTISM\r\n\r\nThe reformers agreed in substituting for the authority of popes and church\r\ncouncils the authority of the Bible. They went back fifteen hundred years\r\nto the time of the Apostles and tried to restore what they believed to be\r\nApostolic Christianity. Hence they rejected such doctrines and practices\r\nas were supposed to have developed during the Middle Ages. The Reformation\r\nalso abolished the monastic system and priestly celibacy. The sharp\r\ndistinction between clergy and laity disappeared, for priests married,\r\nlived among the people, and no longer formed a separate class. In general,\r\nProtestantism affirmed the ability of every man to find salvation without\r\nthe aid of ecclesiastics. The Church was no longer the only \"gate of\r\nheaven.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHAINED BIBLE\r\nIn the church of St. Crux, York.]\r\n\r\nDIVISIONS AMONG PROTESTANTS\r\n\r\nBut the Protestant idea of authority led inevitably to differences of\r\nopinion among the reformers. There were various ways of interpreting that\r\nBible to which they appealed as the rule of faith and conduct.\r\nConsequently, Protestantism split up into many sects or denominations, and\r\nthese have gone on multiplying to the present day. Nearly all, however,\r\nare offshoots from the three main varieties of Protestantism which\r\nappeared in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nLUTHERANISM AND ANGLICANISM\r\n\r\nLutheranism and Anglicanism presented some features in common. Both were\r\nstate churches, supported by the government; both had a book of common\r\nprayer; and both recognized the sacraments of baptism, the eucharist, and\r\nconfirmation. The Church of England also kept the sacrament of ordination.\r\nThe Lutheran churches in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, as well as the\r\nChurch of England, likewise retained the episcopate.\r\n\r\nCALVINISM\r\n\r\nCalvinism departed much more widely from Roman Catholicism. It did away\r\nwith the episcopate and had only one order of clergy--the presbyters. [20]\r\nIt provided for a very simple form of worship. In a Calvinistic church the\r\nservice consisted of Bible reading, a sermon, extemporaneous prayers, and\r\nhymns sung by the congregation. The Calvinists kept only two sacraments,\r\nbaptism and the eucharist. They regarded the first, however, as a simple\r\nundertaking to bring up the child in a Christian manner, and the second as\r\nmerely a commemoration of the Last Supper.\r\n\r\nTHE REFORMATION AND FREEDOM\r\n\r\nThe break with Rome did not introduce religious liberty into Europe.\r\nNothing was further from the minds of Luther, Calvin, and other reformers\r\nthan the toleration of Reformation beliefs unlike their own. The early\r\nProtestant sects punished dissenters as zealously as the Roman Church\r\npunished heretics. Lutherans burned the followers of Zwingli in Germany,\r\nCalvin put Servetus to death, and the English government, in the time of\r\nHenry VIII and Elizabeth, executed many Roman Catholics. Complete freedom\r\nof conscience and the right of private judgment in religion have been\r\nsecured in most European countries only within the last hundred years.\r\n\r\nTHE REFORMATION AND MORALS\r\n\r\nThe Reformation, however, did deepen the moral life of European peoples.\r\nThe faithful Protestant or Roman Catholic vied with his neighbor in trying\r\nto show that his particular belief made for better living than any other.\r\nThe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in consequence, were more earnest\r\nand serious, if also more bigoted, than the centuries of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\n\r\n235. THE CATHOLIC COUNTER REFORMATION\r\n\r\nTHE REFORMING POPES\r\n\r\nThe rapid spread of Protestantism soon brought about a Catholic Counter\r\nReformation in those parts of Europe which remained faithful to Rome. The\r\npopes now turned from the cultivation of Renaissance art and literature to\r\nthe defense of their threatened faith. They made needed changes in the\r\npapal court and appointed to ecclesiastical offices men distinguished for\r\nvirtue and learning. This reform of the Papacy dates from the time of Paul\r\nIII, who became pope in 1534 A.D. He opened the college of cardinals to\r\nRoman Catholic reformers, even offering a seat in it to Erasmus. Still\r\nmore important was his support of the famous Society of Jesus, which had\r\nbeen established in the year of his accession to the papal throne.\r\n\r\nST. IGNATIUS LOYOLA, 1491-1556 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the new society was a Spanish nobleman, Ignatius Loyola. He\r\nhad seen a good deal of service in the wars of Charles V against the\r\nFrench. While in a hospital recovering from a wound Loyola read devotional\r\nbooks, and these produced a profound change within him. He now decided to\r\nabandon the career of arms and to become, instead, the knight of Christ.\r\nSo Loyola donned a beggar's robe, practiced all the kinds of asceticism\r\nwhich his books described, and went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The\r\nturning-point of his career came with his visit to Paris to study\r\ntheology. Here Loyola met the six devout and talented men who became the\r\nfirst members of his society. They intended to work as missionaries among\r\nthe Moslems, but, when this plan fell through, they visited Rome and\r\nplaced their energy and enthusiasm at the disposal of the pope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. IGNATIUS LOYOLA]\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIETY OF JESUS\r\n\r\nLoyola's military training deeply affected the character of the new order.\r\nThe Jesuits, as their Protestant opponents styled them, were to be an army\r\nof spiritual soldiers, living under the strictest obedience to their head,\r\nor general. Like soldiers, again, they were to remain in the world, and\r\nthere fight manfully for the Church and against heretics. The society grew\r\nrapidly; before Loyola's death it included over a thousand members; and in\r\nthe seventeenth century it became the most influential of all the\r\nreligious orders. [21] The activity of the Jesuits as preachers,\r\nconfessors, teachers, and missionaries did much to roll back the rising\r\ntide of Protestantism in Europe.\r\n\r\nJESUIT SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits gave special attention to education, for they realized the\r\nimportance of winning over the young people to the Church. Their schools\r\nwere so good that even Protestant children often attended them. The\r\npopularity of Jesuit teachers arose partly from the fact that they always\r\ntried to lead, not drive their pupils. Light punishments, short lessons,\r\nmany holidays, and a liberal use of prizes and other distinctions formed\r\nsome of the attractive features of their system of training. It is not\r\nsurprising that the Jesuits became the instructors of the Roman Catholic\r\nworld. They called their colleges the \"fortresses of the faith.\"\r\n\r\nJESUIT MISSIONS\r\n\r\nThe missions of the Jesuits were not less important than their schools.\r\nThe Jesuits worked in Poland, Hungary, Bohemia, and other countries where\r\nProtestantism threatened to become dominant. Then they invaded all the\r\nlands which the great maritime discoveries of the preceding age had laid\r\nopen to European enterprise. In India, China, the East Indies, Japan, the\r\nPhilippines, Africa, and the two Americas their converts from heathenism\r\nwere numbered by hundreds of thousands.\r\n\r\nST. FRANCIS XAVIER, 1506-1552 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent of all Jesuit missionaries, St. Francis Xavier, had\r\nbelonged to Loyola's original band. He was a little, blue-eyed man, an\r\nengaging preacher, an excellent organizer, and possessed of so attractive\r\na personality that even the ruffians and pirates with whom he had to\r\nassociate on his voyages became his friends. Xavier labored with such\r\ndevotion and success in the Portuguese colonies of the Far East as to gain\r\nthe title of \"Apostle to the Indies.\" He also introduced Christianity in\r\nJapan, where it flourished until a persecuting emperor extinguished it\r\nwith fire and sword.\r\n\r\nCOUNCIL OF TRENT, 1545-1563 A.D.\r\n\r\nAnother agency in the Counter Reformation was the great Church Council\r\nsummoned by Pope Paul III. The council met at Trent, on the borders of\r\nGermany and Italy. It continued, with intermissions, for nearly twenty\r\nyears. The Protestants, though invited to participate, did not attend, and\r\nhence nothing could be done to bring them back within the Roman Catholic\r\nfold. This was the last general council of the Church for over three\r\nhundred years. [22]\r\n\r\nWORK OF THE COUNCIL\r\n\r\nThe Council of Trent made no essential changes in the Roman Catholic\r\ndoctrines, which remained as St. Thomas Aquinas [23] and other theologians\r\nhad set them forth in the Middle Ages. In opposition to the Protestant\r\nview, it declared that the tradition of the Church possessed equal\r\nauthority with the Bible. It reaffirmed the supremacy of the pope over\r\nChristendom. The council also passed important decrees forbidding the sale\r\nof ecclesiastical offices and requiring bishops and other prelates to\r\nattend strictly to their duties. Since the Council of Trent the Roman\r\nChurch has been distinctly a religious organization, instead of both a\r\nsecular and religious body, as was the Church in the Middle Ages. [24]\r\n\r\nTHE INDEX\r\n\r\nThe council, before adjourning, authorized the pope to draw up a list, or\r\nIndex, of works which Roman Catholics might not read. This action did not\r\nform an innovation. The Church from an early day had condemned and\r\ndestroyed heretical writings. However, the invention of printing, by\r\ngiving greater currency to new and dangerous ideas, increased the\r\nnecessity for the regulation of thought. The \"Index of Prohibited Books\"\r\nstill exists, and additions to the list are made from time to time. It was\r\nmatched by the strict censorship of printing long maintained in Protestant\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nTHE INQUISITION\r\n\r\nStill another agency of the Counter Reformation consisted of the\r\nInquisition. This was a system of church courts for the discovery and\r\npunishment of heretics. Such courts had been set up in the Middle Ages,\r\nfor instance, to suppress the Albigensian heresy. After the Council of\r\nTrent they redoubled their activity, especially in Italy, the Netherlands,\r\nand Spain.\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE INQUISITION\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition probably contributed to the disappearance of Protestantism\r\nin Italy. In the Netherlands, where it worked with great severity, it only\r\naroused exasperation and hatred and helped to provoke a successful revolt\r\nof the Dutch people. The Spaniards, on the other hand, approved of the\r\nmethods of the Inquisition and welcomed its extermination of Moors and\r\nJews, as well as Protestant heretics. The Spanish Inquisition was not\r\nabolished till the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n236. SPAIN UNDER PHILIP II, 1556-1598 A.D.\r\n\r\nABDICATION OF CHARLES V, 1555-1556 A.D.\r\n\r\nIn 1555 A.D., the year of the Peace of Augsburg, [25] Charles V determined\r\nto abdicate his many crowns and seek the repose of a monastery. The plan\r\nwas duly carried into effect. His brother Ferdinand I succeeded to the\r\ntitle of Holy Roman Emperor and the Austrian territories, while his son,\r\nPhilip II, [26] received the Spanish possessions in Italy, the\r\nNetherlands, and America. There were now two branches of the Hapsburg\r\nfamily--one in Austria and one in Spain.\r\n\r\nPHILIP II\r\n\r\nThe new king of Spain was a man of unflagging energy, strong will, and\r\ndeep attachment to the Roman Church. As a ruler he had two great ideals:\r\nto make Spain the foremost state in the world and to secure the triumph of\r\nthe Roman Catholic faith over Protestantism. His efforts to realize these\r\nideals largely determined European history during the second half of the\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILIP II\r\nAfter the portrait by Titian.]\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF LEPANTO, 1571 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish monarch won renown by becoming the champion of Christendom\r\nagainst the Ottoman Turks. At this time the Turks had a strong navy, by\r\nmeans of which they captured Cyprus from the Venetians and ravaged Sicily\r\nand southern Italy. Grave danger existed that they would soon control all\r\nthe Mediterranean. To stay their further progress one of the popes\r\npreached what was really the last crusade. The fleets of Genoa and Venice\r\nunited with those of Spain and under Don John of Austria, Philip's half-\r\nbrother, totally defeated the Turkish squadron in the gulf of Lepanto, off\r\nthe western coast of Greece. The battle gave a blow to the sea-power of\r\nthe Turks from which they never recovered and ended their aggressive\r\nwarfare in the Mediterranean. Lepanto is one of the proud names in the\r\nhistory of Spain.\r\n\r\nANNEXATION OF PORTUGAL, 1581 A.D.\r\n\r\nPhilip had inherited an extensive realm. He further widened it by the\r\nannexation of Portugal, thus completing the unification of the Spanish\r\npeninsula. The Portuguese colonies in Africa, Asia, and America also\r\npassed into Spanish hands. The union of Spain and Portugal under one crown\r\nnever commanded any affection among the Portuguese, who were proud of\r\ntheir nationality and of their achievements as explorers and empire-\r\nbuilders. Portugal separated from Spain in 1640 A.D. and has since\r\nremained an independent state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ESCORIAL\r\nThis remarkable edifice, at once a convent, a church, a palace, and a\r\nroyal mausoleum, is situated in a sterile and gloomy wilderness about\r\ntwenty-seven miles from Madrid. It was begun by Philip II in 1563 A.D.\r\nand was completed twenty-one years later. The Escorial is dedicated to St.\r\nLawrence, that saint's day (August 10, 1557) being the day when the\r\nSpanish king won a great victory over the French at the battle of St.\r\nQuentin. The huge dimensions of the Escorial may be inferred from the fact\r\nthat it includes eighty-six staircases, eighty-nine fountains, fifteen\r\ncloisters, 1,200 doors, 2,600 windows, and miles of corridors. The\r\nbuilding material is a granite-like stone obtained in the neighborhood.\r\nThe Escorial contains a library of rare books and manuscripts and a\r\ncollection of valuable paintings. In the royal mausoleum under the altar\r\nof the church lie the remains of Charles V, Philip II, and many of their\r\nsuccessors.]\r\n\r\nPHILIP'S FAILURES\r\n\r\nBut the successes of Philip were more than offset by his failures. Though\r\nhe had vast possessions, enormous revenues, mighty fleets, and armies\r\nreputed the best of the age, he could not dominate western Europe. His\r\nattempt to conquer England, a stronghold of Protestantism under Elizabeth,\r\nresulted in disaster. Not less disastrous was his life-long struggle with\r\nthe Netherlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n237. REVOLT OF THE NETHERLANDS\r\n\r\nTHE NETHERLANDS\r\n\r\nThe seventeen provinces of the Netherlands occupied the flat, low country\r\nalong the North Sea--the Holland, Belgium, and northern France of the\r\npresent day. During the fifteenth century they became Hapsburg possessions\r\nand thus belonged to the Holy Roman Empire. As we have learned, Charles V\r\nreceived them as a part of his inheritance, and he, in turn, transmitted\r\nthem to Philip II.\r\n\r\nCONDITION OF THE NETHERLANDS\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the Netherlands were not racially united. In the\r\nsouthernmost provinces Celtic blood and Romance speech prevailed, while\r\nfarther north dwelt peoples of Teutonic extraction, who spoke Flemish and\r\nDutch. Each province likewise kept its own government and customs. The\r\nprosperity which had marked the Flemish cities during the Middle Ages [27]\r\nextended in the sixteenth century to the Dutch cities also. Rotterdam,\r\nLeyden, Utrecht, and Amsterdam profited by the geographical discoveries\r\nand became centers of extensive commerce with Asia and America. The rise\r\nof the Dutch power, in a country so exposed to destructive inundations of\r\nboth sea and rivers, is a striking instance of what can be accomplished by\r\na frugal, industrious population.\r\n\r\nPROTESTANTISM IN THE NETHERLANDS\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands were too near Germany not to be affected by the\r\nReformation. Lutheranism soon appeared there, only to encounter the\r\nhostility of Charles V, who introduced the terrors of the Inquisition.\r\nMany heretics were burned at the stake, or beheaded, or buried alive. But\r\nthere is no seed like martyr's blood. The number of Protestants swelled,\r\nrather than lessened, especially after Calvinism entered the Netherlands.\r\nAs a Jesuit historian remarked, \"Nor did the Rhine from Germany or the\r\nMeuse from France send more water into the Low Countries than by the one\r\nthe contagion of Luther, and by the other that of Calvin, were imported\r\ninto these provinces.\"\r\n\r\nPOLICY OF PHILIP II\r\n\r\nIn spite of the cruel treatment of heretics by Charles V, both Flemish and\r\nDutch remained loyal to the emperor, because he had been born and reared\r\namong them and always considered their country as his own. But Philip II,\r\na Spaniard by birth and sympathies, seemed to them only a foreign master.\r\nThe new ruler did nothing to conciliate the people. He never visited the\r\nNetherlands after 1559 A.D., but governed them despotically through\r\nSpanish officials supported by Spanish garrisons. Arbitrary taxes were\r\nlevied, cities and nobles were deprived of their cherished privileges, and\r\nthe activity of the Inquisition was redoubled. Philip intended to exercise\r\nin the Netherlands the same absolute power which he enjoyed in Spain.\r\n\r\nALVA SENT TO THE NETHERLANDS, 1567 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe religious persecution which by Philip's orders raged through the\r\nNetherlands everywhere aroused intense indignation. The result was rioting\r\nby mobs of Protestants, who wrecked churches and monasteries and carried\r\noff the treasure they found in them. Philip replied to these acts by\r\nsending his best army, under the duke of Alva, his best general, to reduce\r\nthe turbulent provinces into submission.\r\n\r\nOUTBREAK OF THE REVOLT\r\n\r\nAlva carried out with thoroughness the policy of his royal master. A\r\ntribunal, popularly known as the \"Council of Blood,\" was set up for the\r\npunishment of treason and heresy. Hundreds, and probably thousands,\r\nperished; tens of thousands fled to Germany and England. Alva, as\r\ngovernor-general, also raised enormous taxes, which threatened to destroy\r\nthe trade and manufactures of the Netherlands. Under these circumstances\r\nRoman Catholics and Protestants, nobles and townsfolk, united against\r\ntheir Spanish oppressors. A revolt began which Spain could never quell.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM THE SILENT, 1533-1584 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands found a leader in William, Prince of Orange, later known\r\nas William the Silent, because of his customary discreetness. He was of\r\nGerman birth, a convert to Protestantism, and the owner of large estates\r\nin the Netherlands. William had fair ability as a general, a statesmanlike\r\ngrasp of the situation, and above all a stout, courageous heart which\r\nnever wavered in moments of danger and defeat. To rescue the Netherlands\r\nfrom Spain he sacrificed his high position, his wealth, and eventually his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM THE SILENT]\r\n\r\nSEPARATION OF THE NETHERLANDS\r\n\r\nThe ten southern provinces of the Netherlands, mainly Roman Catholic in\r\npopulation, soon effected a reconciliation with Philip and returned to\r\ntheir allegiance. They remained in Hapsburg hands for over two centuries.\r\nModern Belgium has grown out of them. The seven northern provinces, where\r\nDutch was the language and Protestantism the religion, formed in 1579 A.D.\r\nthe Union of Utrecht. Two years later they declared their independence of\r\nSpain. Thus the republic of the United Netherlands, often known as\r\nHolland, the most important of the seven provinces, came into being.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, THE NETHERLANDS IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\nCOURSE OF THE REVOLT\r\n\r\nThe struggle of the Dutch for freedom forms one of the most notable\r\nepisodes in history. At first they were no match for the disciplined\r\nSpanish soldiery, but they fought bravely behind the walls of their cities\r\nand on more than one occasion repelled the enemy by cutting the dikes and\r\nletting in the sea. Though William the Silent perished in a dark hour by\r\nan assassin's bullet, the contest continued. England now came to the aid\r\nof the hard-pressed republic with money and a small army. Philip turned\r\nupon his new antagonist and sent against England the great fleet called\r\nthe \"Invincible Armada.\" Its destruction interfered with further attempts\r\nto subjugate the Dutch, but the Spanish monarch, stubborn to the last,\r\nrefused to acknowledge their independence. His successor, in 1609 A.D.,\r\nconsented to a twelve years' truce with the revolted provinces. Their\r\nfreedom was recognized officially by Spain at the close of the Thirty\r\nYears' War in 1648 A.D.\r\n\r\nTHE DUTCH REPUBLIC\r\n\r\nThe long struggle bound the Dutch together and made them one nation.\r\nDuring the seventeenth century they took a prominent part in European\r\naffairs. The republic which they founded ought to be of special interest\r\nto Americans, for many features of our national government are Dutch in\r\norigin. To Holland we owe the idea of a declaration of independence, of a\r\nwritten constitution, of religious toleration, and of a comprehensive\r\nschool system supported by taxation. In these and other matters the Dutch\r\nwere pioneers of modern democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n238. ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH, 1558-1603 A.D.\r\n\r\nELIZABETH\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth, who reigned over England during the period of the Dutch\r\nrevolt, came to the throne when about twenty-five years old. She was tall\r\nand commanding in presence and endowed with great physical vigor and\r\nendurance. After hunting all day or dancing all night she could still\r\nattend unremittingly to public business. Elizabeth had received an\r\nexcellent education; she spoke Latin and several modern languages; knew a\r\nlittle Greek; and displayed some skill in music. To her father, Henry\r\nVIII, she doubtless owed her tactfulness and charm of manner, as well as\r\nher imperious will; she resembled her mother, Anne Boleyn, in her vanity\r\nand love of display. As a ruler Elizabeth was shrewd, far-sighted, a good\r\njudge of character, and willing to be guided by the able counselors who\r\nsurrounded her. Above all, Elizabeth was an ardent patriot. She understood\r\nand loved her people, and they, in turn, felt a chivalrous devotion to the\r\n\"Virgin Queen,\" to \"Good Queen Bess\".\r\n\r\nPROTESTANTISM IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Anne Boleyn had been born under the ban of the pope, so\r\nthat opposition to Rome was the natural course for her to pursue. Two acts\r\nof Parliament now separated England once more from the Papacy and gave the\r\nEnglish Church practically the form and doctrines which it retains to-day.\r\nThe church was intended to include everyone in England, and hence all\r\npersons were required to attend religious exercises on Sundays and holy\r\ndays. Refusal to do so exposed the offender to a fine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELIZABETH]\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF ROMAN CATHOLICS\r\n\r\nThe great body of the people soon conformed to the state church, but Roman\r\nCatholics could not conscientiously attend its services. The laws against\r\nthem do not seem to have been strictly enforced at first, but in the later\r\nyears of Elizabeth's reign real or suspected plots by Roman Catholics\r\nagainst her throne led to a policy of repression. Those who said or heard\r\nmass were heavily fined and imprisoned; those who brought papal bulls into\r\nEngland or converted Protestants to Roman Catholicism were executed as\r\ntraitors. Several hundred priests, mostly Jesuits, suffered death, and\r\nmany more languished in jail. This persecution, however necessary it may\r\nhave seemed to Elizabeth and her advisers, is a blot on her reign.\r\n\r\nPROTESTANTISM IN IRELAND\r\n\r\nThe Reformation made little progress in Ireland. Henry VIII, who had\r\nextended English sway over most of the island, suppressed the monasteries,\r\ndemolished shrines, relics, and images, and placed English-speaking\r\npriests in charge of the churches. The Irish people, who remained loyal to\r\nRome, regarded these measures as the tyrannical acts of a foreign\r\ngovernment. During Elizabeth's reign there were several dangerous revolts,\r\nwhich her generals suppressed with great cruelty. The result was to widen\r\nthe breach between England and Ireland. Henceforth to most Irishmen\r\npatriotism became identified with Roman Catholicism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILVER CROWN OF ELIZABETH'S REIGN]\r\n\r\nELIZABETH AND MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS\r\n\r\nMany of the plots against Elizabeth centered about Mary Stuart, the ill-\r\nstarred Queen of Scots. She was a granddaughter of Henry VII, and extreme\r\nRoman Catholics claimed that she had a better right to the English throne\r\nthan Elizabeth, because the pope had declared the marriage of Henry VIII\r\nand Anne Boleyn null and void. Mary, a fervent Roman Catholic, did not\r\nplease her Scotch subjects, who had adopted Calvinistic doctrines. She\r\nalso discredited herself by marrying the man who had murdered her former\r\nhusband. An uprising of the Scottish nobles compelled Mary to abdicate the\r\nthrone in favor of her infant son [28] and to take refuge in England.\r\nElizabeth kept her rival in captivity for nearly twenty years. In 1586\r\nA.D., the former queen was found guilty of conspiring against Elizabeth's\r\nlife and was beheaded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, WESTERN EUROPE IN THE TIME OF ELIZABETH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONDON BRIDGE IN THE TIME OF ELIZABETH\r\nThe old structure was completed early in the thirteenth century. It\r\nmeasured 924 feet in length and had 20 narrow arches. Note the rows of\r\nhouses and shops on the bridge, the chapel in the center and the gate\r\nabove which the heads of traitors were exhibited on pikes. The present\r\nLondon Bridge was completed in 1831 A.D.]\r\n\r\nELIZABETH AND PHILIP II\r\n\r\nPhilip II, the king of Spain, also threatened Elizabeth's security. At the\r\noutset of her reign Philip had made her an offer of marriage, but she\r\nrefused to give herself, or England, a Spanish master. As time went on,\r\nPhilip turned into an open enemy of the Protestant queen and did his best\r\nto stir up sedition among her Roman Catholic subjects. It must be admitted\r\nthat Philip could plead strong justification for his attitude. Elizabeth\r\nallowed the English \"sea dogs\" [29] to plunder Spanish colonies and seize\r\nSpanish vessels laden with the treasure of the New World. Moreover, she\r\naided the rebellious Dutch, at first secretly and at length openly, in\r\ntheir struggle against Spain. Philip put up with these aggressions for\r\nmany years, but finally came to the conclusion that he could never subdue\r\nthe Netherlands or end the piracy and smuggling in Spanish America without\r\nfirst conquering England. The execution of Mary Stuart removed his last\r\ndoubts, for Mary had left him her claims to the English throne. He at once\r\nmade ready to invade England. Philip seems to have believed that as soon\r\nas a Spanish army landed in the island, the Roman Catholics would rally to\r\nhis cause. But the Spanish king never had a chance to verify his belief;\r\nthe decisive battle took place on the sea.\r\n\r\nTHE \"INVINCIBLE ARMADA,\" 1588 A.D.\r\n\r\nPhilip had not completed his preparations before Sir Francis Drake sailed\r\ninto Cadiz harbor and destroyed a vast amount of naval stores and\r\nshipping. This exploit, which Drake called \"singeing the king of Spain's\r\nbeard,\" delayed the expedition for a year. The \"Invincible Armada\" [30]\r\nset out at last in 1588 A.D. The Spanish vessels, though somewhat larger\r\nthan those of the English, were inferior in number, speed, and gunnery to\r\ntheir adversaries, while the Spanish officers, mostly unused to the sea,\r\nwere no match for men like Drake, Frobisher, and Raleigh, the best\r\nmariners of the age. The Armada suffered severely in a nine-days fight in\r\nthe Channel, and many vessels which escaped the English guns met shipwreck\r\noff the Scotch and Irish coasts. Less than half of the Armada returned in\r\nsafety to Spain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SPANISH ARMADA IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL.\r\nAfter an engraving by the Society of Antiquarians following a tapestry in\r\nthe House of Lords.]\r\n\r\nENGLISH SEA-POWER\r\n\r\nEngland in the later Middle Ages had been an important naval power, as her\r\nability to carry on the Hundred Years' War in France amply proved. But in\r\nthe sixteenth century she was greatly over-matched by Spain, especially\r\nafter the annexation of Portugal added the naval forces of that country to\r\nthe Spanish fleets. The defeat of the Armada not only did great harm to\r\nthe navy and commerce of Spain; it also showed that a new people had\r\narisen to claim the supremacy of the ocean. Henceforth the English began\r\nto build up what was to be a sea-power greater than any other known to\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n239. THE HUGUENOT WARS IN FRANCE\r\n\r\nFRANCE UNDER FRANCIS I, 1515-1547 A.D.\r\n\r\nBy 1500 A.D. France had become a centralized state under a strong\r\nmonarchy. [31] Francis I, who reigned in the first half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, still further exalted the royal power. He had many wars with\r\nCharles V, whose extensive dominions nearly surrounded the French kingdom.\r\nThese wars prevented the emperor from making France a mere dependency of\r\nSpain. As we have learned, [32] they also interfered with the efforts of\r\nCharles V to crush the Protestants in Germany.\r\n\r\nTHE HUGUENOTS\r\n\r\nProtestantism in France dates from the time of Francis I. The Huguenots,\r\n[33] as the French Protestants were called, naturally accepted the\r\ndoctrines of Calvin, who was himself a Frenchman and whose books were\r\nwritten in the French language. Though bitterly persecuted by Francis I\r\nand by his son Henry II (1547-1559 A.D.), the Huguenots gained a large\r\nfollowing, especially among the prosperous middle class of the towns--the\r\n_bourgeoisie_. Many nobles also became Huguenots, sometimes because of\r\nreligious conviction, but often because the new movement offered them an\r\nopportunity to recover their feudal independence and to plunder the\r\nestates of the Church. In France, as well as in Germany, the Reformation\r\nhad its worldly side.\r\n\r\nCIVIL WAR IN FRANCE\r\n\r\nDuring most of the second half of the sixteenth century fierce conflicts\r\nraged in France between the Roman Catholics and the Huguenots. Philip II\r\naided the former and Queen Elizabeth gave some assistance to the latter.\r\nFrance suffered terribly in the struggle, not only from the constant\r\nfighting, which cost the lives, it is said, of more than a million people,\r\nbut also from the pillage, burnings, and other barbarities in which both\r\nsides indulged. The wealth and prosperity of the country visibly declined,\r\nand all patriotic feeling disappeared in the hatreds engendered by a civil\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nMASSACRE OF ST. BARTHOLOMEW'S DAY, 1572 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe episode known as the massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day illustrates the\r\nextremes to which political ambition and religious bigotry could lead. The\r\nmassacre was an attempt to extirpate the Huguenots, root and branch, at a\r\ntime when peace prevailed between them and their opponents. The person\r\nprimarily responsible for it was Catherine de' Medici, mother of Charles\r\nIX (1560-1574 A.D.), the youthful king of France. Charles had begun to\r\ncast off the sway of his mother and to come under the influence of Admiral\r\nde Coligny, the most eminent of the Huguenots. To regain her power\r\nCatherine first tried to have Coligny murdered. When the plot failed, she\r\ninvented the story of a great Huguenot uprising and induced her weak-\r\nminded son to authorize a wholesale butchery of Huguenots. It began in\r\nParis in the early morning of August 24, 1572 A.D. (St. Bartholomew's\r\nDay), and extended to the provinces, where it continued for several weeks.\r\nProbably ten thousand Huguenots were slain, including Coligny himself. But\r\nthe deed was a blunder as well as a crime. The Huguenots took up arms to\r\ndefend themselves, and France again experienced all the horrors of\r\ninternecine strife.\r\n\r\nHENRY IV\r\n\r\nThe death of Coligny transferred the leadership of the Huguenots to Henry\r\nBourbon, king of Navarre. [34] Seventeen years after the massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew's Day, he inherited the French crown as Henry IV. The Roman\r\nCatholics would not accept a Protestant ruler and continued the conflict.\r\nHenry soon realized that only his conversion to the faith of the majority\r\nof his subjects would bring a lasting peace. Religious opinions had always\r\nsat lightly upon him, and he found no great difficulty in becoming a Roman\r\nCatholic. \"Paris,\" said Henry, \"was well worth a mass.\" Opposition to the\r\nking soon collapsed, and the Huguenot wars came to an end.\r\n\r\nEDICT OF NANTES, 1598 A.D.\r\n\r\nThough now a Roman Catholic, Henry did not break with the Huguenots. In\r\n1598 A.D. he issued in their interest the celebrated Edict of Nantes. By\r\nits terms the Huguenots were to enjoy freedom of private worship\r\neverywhere in France, and freedom to worship publicly in a large number of\r\nvillages and towns. Only Roman Catholic services, however, might be held\r\nin Paris and at the royal court. Though the edict did not grant complete\r\nreligious liberty, it marked an important step in that direction. A great\r\nEuropean state now for the first time recognized the principle that two\r\nrival faiths might exist side by side within its borders. The edict was\r\nthus the most important act of toleration since the age of Constantine.\r\n[35]\r\n\r\nFRANCE UNDER HENRY IV, 1588-1610 A.D.\r\n\r\nHaving settled the religious difficulties, Henry could take up the work of\r\nrestoring prosperity to distracted France. His interest in the welfare of\r\nhis subjects gained for him the name of \"Good King Henry.\" With the help\r\nof Sully, his chief minister, the king reformed the finances and\r\nextinguished the public debt. He opened roads, built bridges, and dug\r\ncanals, thus aiding the restoration of agriculture. He also encouraged\r\ncommerce by means of royal bounties for shipbuilding. The French at this\r\ntime began to have a navy and to compete with the Dutch and English for\r\ntrade on the high seas. Henry's work of renovation was cut short in 1610\r\nA.D. by an assassin's dagger. Under his son Louis XIII (1610-1643 A.D.), a\r\nlong period of disorder followed, until an able minister, Cardinal\r\nRichelieu, assumed the guidance of public affairs. Richelieu for many\r\nyears was the real ruler of France. His foreign policy led to the\r\nintervention of that country in the international conflict known as the\r\nThirty Years' War.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARDINAL RICHELIEU (Louvre, Paris.)\r\nAfter the portrait by the Belgian artist, Philippe de Champaigne.]\r\n\r\n\r\n240. THE THIRTY YEARS' WAR, 1618-1648 A.D.\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS ANTAGONISMS\r\n\r\nThe Peace of Augsburg [36] gave repose to Germany for more than sixty\r\nyears, but it did not form a complete settlement of the religious question\r\nin that country. There was still room for bitter disputes, especially over\r\nthe ownership of Church property which had been secularized in the course\r\nof the Reformation. Furthermore, the peace recognized only Roman Catholics\r\nand Lutherans and gave no rights whatever to the large body of Calvinists.\r\nThe failure of Lutherans and Calvinists to cooperate weakened German\r\nProtestantism just at the period when the Counter Reformation inspired\r\nRoman Catholicism with fresh energy and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL FRICTION\r\n\r\nPolitics, as well as religion, also helped to bring about the great\r\nconflagration. The Roman Catholic party relied for support on the Hapsburg\r\nemperors, who wished to unite the German states under their control, thus\r\nrestoring the Holy Roman Empire to its former proud position in the\r\naffairs of Europe. The Protestant princes, on the other hand, wanted to\r\nbecome independent sovereigns. Hence they resented all efforts to extend\r\nthe imperial authority over them.\r\n\r\nTHE BOHEMIAN REVOLT\r\n\r\nThe Thirty Years' War was not so much a single conflict as a series of\r\nconflicts, which ultimately involved nearly all western Europe. It began\r\nin Bohemia, where Protestantism had not been extinguished by the Hussite\r\nwars. [37] The Bohemian nobles, many of whom were Calvinists, revolted\r\nagainst Hapsburg rule and proclaimed the independence of Bohemia. The\r\nGerman Lutherans gave them no aid, however, and the emperor, Ferdinand II,\r\neasily put down the insurrection. Many thousands of Protestants were now\r\ndriven into exile. Those who remained in Bohemia were obliged to accept\r\nRoman Catholicism. Thus one more country was lost to Protestantism.\r\n\r\nDANISH INTERVENTION\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Bohemian revolt aroused the greatest alarm in Germany.\r\nFerdinand threatened to follow in the footsteps of Charles V and to crush\r\nProtestantism in the land of its birth. When, therefore, the king of\r\nDenmark, who as duke of Holstein had great interest in German affairs,\r\ndecided to intervene, both Lutherans and Calvinists supported him. But\r\nWallenstein, the emperor's able general, proved more than a match for the\r\nDanish king, who at length withdrew from the contest.\r\n\r\nEDICT OF RESTITUTION, 1692 A.D.\r\n\r\nSo far the Roman Catholic and imperial party had triumphed. Ferdinand's\r\nsuccess led him to issue the Edict of Restitution, which compelled the\r\nProtestants to restore all the Church property which they had taken since\r\nthe Peace of Augsburg. The enforcement of the edict brought about renewed\r\nresistance on the part of the Protestants.\r\n\r\nGUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS AND THE INTERVENTION OF SWEDEN\r\n\r\nThere now appeared the single heroic figure on the stage of the Thirty\r\nYears' War. This was Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, and a man of\r\nmilitary genius. He had the deepest sympathy for his fellow-Protestants in\r\nGermany and regarded himself as their divinely appointed deliverer. By\r\ntaking part in the war Gustavus also hoped to conquer the coast of\r\nnorthern Germany. The Baltic would then become a Swedish lake, for Sweden\r\nalready possessed Finland and what are now the Russian provinces on the\r\nBaltic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS\r\nAfter the portrait by the Flemish artist, Sir Anthony Van Dyck.]\r\n\r\nGUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS IN GERMANY, 1630-1632 A.D.\r\n\r\nGustavus entered Germany with a strong force of disciplined soldiers and\r\ntried to form alliances with the Protestant princes. They received him\r\ncoolly at first, for the Swedish king seemed to them only a foreign\r\ninvader. Just at this time the imperialists captured Magdeburg, the\r\nlargest and most prosperous city in northern Germany. At least twenty\r\nthousand of the inhabitants perished miserably amid the smoking ruins of\r\ntheir homes. This massacre turned Protestant sentiment toward Gustavus as\r\nthe \"Lion of the North\" who had come to preserve Germany from destruction.\r\nWith the help of his allies Gustavus reconquered most of Germany for the\r\nProtestants, but he fell at the battle of Lützen in the moment of victory.\r\nHis work, however, was done. The Swedish king had saved the cause of\r\nProtestantism in Germany.\r\n\r\nRICHELIEU AND THE INTERVENTION OF FRANCE\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Gustavus the war assumed more and more a political\r\ncharacter. The German Protestants found an ally, strangely enough, in\r\nCardinal Richelieu, the all-powerful minister of the French king.\r\nRichelieu entered the struggle in order to humble the Austrian Hapsburgs\r\nand extend the boundaries of France toward the Rhine, at the expense of\r\nthe Holy Roman Empire. Since the Spanish Hapsburgs were aiding their\r\nAustrian kinsmen, Richelieu naturally fought against Spain also. The war\r\nthus became a great international conflict in which religion played only a\r\nminor part. The Holy Roman Emperor had to yield at last and consented to\r\nthe treaties of peace signed at two cities in the province of Westphalia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, EUROPE at the End of the Thirty Years' War, 1648 A.D.]\r\n\r\nPEACE OF WESTPHALIA, 1648 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Peace of Westphalia ended the long series of wars which followed the\r\nReformation. It practically settled the religious question, for it allowed\r\nCalvinists in Germany to enjoy the same privileges as Lutherans and also\r\nwithdrew the Edict of Restitution. Nothing was said in the treaties about\r\nliberty of conscience, but from this time the idea that religious\r\ndifferences should be settled by force gradually passed away from the\r\nminds of men.\r\n\r\nTERRITORIAL READJUSTMENTS\r\n\r\nThe political clauses of the peace were numerous. France received nearly\r\nall of Alsace along the Rhine. Sweden gained possessions in North Germany.\r\nBrandenburg--the future kingdom of Prussia--secured additional territory\r\non the Baltic Sea. The independence of Switzerland [38] and of the United\r\nNetherlands [39] was also recognized.\r\n\r\nDISRUPTION OF GERMANY\r\n\r\nThe Peace of Westphalia left Germany more divided than ever. Each one of\r\nthe larger states was free to coin money, raise armies, make war, and\r\nnegotiate treaties without consulting the emperor. In fact, the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire had become a mere phantom. The Hapsburgs from now on devoted\r\nthemselves to their Austrian dominions, which included more Magyars and\r\nSlavs than Germans. The failure of the Hapsburgs in the Thirty Years' War\r\nlong postponed the unification of Germany.\r\n\r\nEXHAUSTION OF GERMANY\r\n\r\nDuring the Thirty Years' War Germany had seen most of the fighting. She\r\nsuffered from it to the point of exhaustion. The population dwindled from\r\nabout sixteen million to one-half, or, as some believe, to one-third that\r\nnumber. The loss of life was partly due to the fearful epidemics, such as\r\ntyphus fever and the bubonic plague, which spread over the land in the\r\nwake of the invading armies. Hundreds of villages were destroyed or were\r\nabandoned by their inhabitants. Much of the soil went out of cultivation,\r\nwhile trade and manufacturing nearly disappeared. Added to all this was\r\nthe decline of education, literature, and art, and the brutalizing of the\r\npeople in mind and morals. It took Germany at least one hundred years to\r\nrecover from the injury inflicted by the Thirty Years' War; complete\r\nrecovery, indeed, came only in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nRISE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\r\n\r\nThe savagery displayed by all participants in the Thirty Years' War could\r\nnot but impress thinking men with the necessity of formulating rules to\r\nprotect noncombatants, to care for prisoners, and to do away with pillage\r\nand massacre. The worst horrors of the war had not taken place, before a\r\nDutch jurist, named Hugo Grotius, published at Paris in 1625 A.D. a work\r\n_On the Laws of War and Peace_. It may be said to have founded\r\ninternational law. The success of the book was remarkable. Gustavus\r\nAdolphus carried a copy about with him during his campaigns, and its\r\nleading doctrines were recognized and acted upon in the Peace of\r\nWestphalia.\r\n\r\nTHE EUROPEAN STATE SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThe great principle on which Grotius based his recommendations was the\r\nindependence of sovereign states. He gave up the medieval conception of a\r\ntemporal and spiritual head of Christendom. The nations now recognized no\r\ncommon superior, whether emperor or pope, but all were equal in the sight\r\nof international law. The book of Grotius thus marked the profound change\r\nwhich had come over Europe since the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.

[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n241. THE DIVINE RIGHT OF KINGS\r\n\r\nABSOLUTISM\r\n\r\nMost European nations in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries accepted\r\nthe principle of absolutism in government. Absolutism was as popular then\r\nas democracy is to-day. The rulers of France, Spain, Portugal, Austria,\r\nScandinavia, and other countries, having triumphed over the feudal nobles,\r\nproceeded to revive the autocratic traditions of imperial Rome. Like\r\nDiocletian, Constantine, and later emperors, they posed as absolute\r\nsovereigns, who held their power, not from the choice or consent of their\r\nsubjects, but from God.\r\n\r\nDIVINITY OF KINGS\r\n\r\nRoyal absolutism formed a natural development of the old belief in the\r\ndivinity of kings. Many primitive peoples regard their headmen and chiefs\r\nas holy and give to them the control of peace and war, of life and death.\r\nOriental rulers in antiquity bore a sacred character. Even in the lifetime\r\nof an Egyptian Pharaoh temples were erected to him and offerings were made\r\nto his sacred majesty. The Hebrew monarch was the Lord's anointed, and his\r\nperson was holy. The Hellenistic kings of the East and the Roman emperors\r\nreceived divine honors from their adoring subjects. An element of sanctity\r\nalso attached to medieval sovereigns, who, at their coronation, were\r\nanointed with a magic oil, girt with a sacred sword, and given a\r\nsupernatural banner. Even Shakespeare could speak of the divinity which\r\n\"doth hedge a king.\" [2]\r\n\r\n  \"Not all the water in the rough rude sea\r\n  Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;\r\n  The breath of worldly men cannot depose\r\n  The deputy elected by the Lord.\" [3]\r\n\r\nDIVINE RIGHT AFTER THE REFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Reformation tended to emphasize the sacred character of kingship. The\r\nreformers set up the authority of the State against the authority of the\r\nChurch, which they rejected and condemned. Providence, they argued, had\r\nnever sanctioned the Papacy, but Providence had really ordained the State\r\nand had placed over it a king whom it was a religious duty to obey. Even\r\nthose who were not reformers distorted the Christian idea that government\r\nhas a divine basis to represent kings as God's vicegerents upon earth, as\r\nin fact earthly deities.\r\n\r\nBOSSUET ON DIVINE RIGHT\r\n\r\nThe theory of divine right received its fullest expression in a famous\r\nbook [4] written by Bossuet, a learned French bishop of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. A hereditary monarchy, declared Bossuet, is the most ancient and\r\nnatural, the strongest and most efficient, of all forms of government.\r\nRoyal power emanates from God; hence the person of the king is sacred and\r\nit is sacrilege to conspire against him. His authority is absolute and\r\nautocratic. No man may rightfully resist the king's commands; his subjects\r\nowe him obedience in all matters. To the violence of a king the people can\r\noppose only respectful remonstrances and prayers for his conversion. A\r\nking, to be sure, ought not to be a tyrant, but he can be one in perfect\r\nsecurity. \"As in God are united all perfection and every virtue, so all\r\nthe power of all the individuals in a community is united in the person of\r\nthe king.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n242. THE ABSOLUTISM OF LOUIS XIV, 1661-1715 A.D.\r\n\r\nCARDINAL RICHELIEU\r\n\r\nFrance in the seventeenth century furnished the best example of an\r\nabsolute monarchy supported by pretensions to divine right. French\r\nabsolutism owed most of all to Cardinal Richelieu, [5] the chief minister\r\nof Louis XIII. Though a man of poor physique and in weak health, he\r\npossessed such strength of will, together with such thorough understanding\r\nof politics, that he was able to dominate the king and through the king to\r\ngovern France for eighteen years (1624-1642 A.D.).\r\n\r\nPOLICIES OF RICHELIEU\r\n\r\nRichelieu's foreign policy led to his intervention on the side of the\r\nProtestants at a decisive moment in the Thirty Years' War. The great\r\ncardinal, however, did not live to see the triumph of his measures in the\r\nPeace of Westphalia, which humiliated the Hapsburgs and raised France to\r\nthe first place among the states of western Europe. Richelieu's domestic\r\npolicy--to make the French king supreme--was equally successful. Though\r\nthe nobles were still rich and influential, Richelieu beat down their\r\nopposition by forbidding the practice of duelling, that last remnant of\r\nprivate warfare, by ordering many castles to be blown up with gunpowder,\r\nand by bringing rebellious dukes and counts to the scaffold. Henceforth\r\nthe nobles were no longer feudal lords but only courtiers.\r\n\r\nCARDINAL MAZARIN\r\n\r\nRichelieu died in 1642 A.D., and the next year Louis XIII, the master whom\r\nhe had served so faithfully, also passed away. The new ruler, Louis XIV,\r\nwas only a child, and the management of affairs for a second period of\r\neighteen years passed into the hands of Cardinal Mazarin. Though an\r\nItalian by birth, he became a naturalized Frenchman and carried out\r\nRichelieu's policies. Against the Hapsburgs Mazarin continued the great\r\nwar which Richelieu had begun and brought it to a satisfactory conclusion.\r\nThe Peace of Westphalia was Mazarin's greatest triumph. He also crushed a\r\nformidable uprising against the crown, on the part of discontented nobles.\r\nHaving achieved all this, the cardinal could truly say that \"if his\r\nlanguage was not French, his heart was,\" His death in 1661 A.D. found the\r\nroyal authority more firmly established than ever before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARDINAL MAZARIN\r\nA miniature by Petitot, in the South Kensington Museum, London.]\r\n\r\nLOUIS XIV, THE MAN\r\n\r\nLouis XIV, who now in his twenty-third year took up the reins of\r\ngovernment, ranks among the ablest of French monarchs. He was a man of\r\nhandsome presence, slightly below the middle height, with a prominent nose\r\nand abundant hair, which he allowed to fall over his shoulders. In manner\r\nhe was dignified, reserved, courteous, and as majestic, it is said, in his\r\ndressing-gown as in his robes of state. A contemporary wrote that he would\r\nhave been every inch a king, \"even if he had been born under the roof of a\r\nbeggar.\" Louis possessed much natural intelligence, a retentive memory,\r\nand great capacity for work. It must be added, however, that his general\r\neducation had been much neglected, and that throughout his life he\r\nremained ignorant and superstitious. Vanity formed a striking trait in the\r\ncharacter of Louis. He accepted the most fulsome compliments and delighted\r\nto be known as the \"Grand Monarch\" and the \"Sun-king.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS XIV\r\nA portrait by J. Gale, in the Sutherland Collection, London.]\r\n\r\nCOURT OF LOUIS XIV AT VERSAILLES\r\n\r\nLouis gathered around him a magnificent court, which he located at\r\nVersailles, near Paris. Here a whole royal city, with palaces, parks,\r\ngroves, and fountains, sprang into being at his fiat. Here the \"Grand\r\nMonarch\" lived surrounded by crowds of fawning courtiers. The French\r\nnobles now spent little time on their country estates; they preferred to\r\nremain at Versailles in attendance on the king, to whose favor they owed\r\noffices, pensions, and honors. The king's countenance, it was said, is the\r\ncourtier's supreme felicity; \"he passes his life looking on it and within\r\nsight of it.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VERSAILLES\r\nThe view shows the rear of the palace a part of the gardens and the grand\r\nstairway leading to the Fountain of Latona. The palace now forms a\r\nmagnificent picture gallery of French historical scenes and personages\r\nwhile the park with its many fine fountains is a place of holiday resort\r\nfor Parisians. It is estimated that Louis XIV spent one hundred million\r\ndollars on the buildings and grounds of Versailles.]\r\n\r\nLOUIS XIV, THE KING\r\n\r\nLouis taught and put into practice the doctrine of divine right. In his\r\nmemoirs he declares that the king is God's representative and for his\r\nactions is answerable to God alone. The famous saying, \"I am the State,\"\r\n[6] though not uttered by Louis, accurately expressed his conviction that\r\nin him was embodied the power and greatness of France. Few monarchs have\r\ntried harder to justify their despotic rule. He was fond of gaiety and\r\nsport, but he never permitted himself to be turned away from the punctual\r\ndischarge of his royal duties. Until the close of his reign--the longest\r\nin the annals of Europe--Louis devoted from five to nine hours a day to\r\nwhat he called the \"trade of a king.\"\r\n\r\nABSOLUTISM IN FRANCE\r\n\r\nConditions in France made possible the despotism of Louis. Richelieu and\r\nMazarin had labored with great success to strengthen the crown at the\r\nexpense of the nobles and the commons. The nation had no Parliament to\r\nrepresent it and voice its demands, for the Estates-General [7] had not\r\nbeen summoned since 1614 A.D. It did not meet again till 1789 A.D., just\r\nbefore the outbreak of the French Revolution. In France there was no Magna\r\nCarta to protect the liberties of the people by limiting the right of a\r\nruler to impose taxes at will. The French, furthermore, lacked independent\r\nlaw courts which could interfere with the king's power of exiling,\r\nimprisoning, or executing his subjects. Thus absolute monarchy became so\r\nfirmly rooted in France that a revolution was necessary to overthrow it.\r\n\r\n\r\n243. FRANCE UNDER LOUIS XIV\r\n\r\nCOLBERT\r\n\r\nNo absolute ruler, however conscientious and painstaking, can shoulder the\r\nentire burden of government. Louis XIV necessarily had to rely very much\r\non his ministers, of whom Colbert was the most eminent. Colbert, until his\r\ndeath in 1683 A.D., gave France the best administration it had ever known.\r\nHis reforming hand was especially felt in the finances. He made many\r\nimprovements in the methods of tax-collection and turned the annual\r\ndeficit in the revenues into a surplus. One of Colbert's innovations, now\r\nadopted by all European states, was the budget system. Before his time\r\nexpenditures had been made at random, without consulting the treasury\r\nreceipts. Colbert drew up careful estimates, one year in advance, of the\r\nprobable revenues and expenditures, so that outlay would never exceed\r\nincome.\r\n\r\nCOLBERT'S ECONOMIC MEASURES\r\n\r\nAlthough the science of economics or political economy was little\r\ndeveloped in the seventeenth century, Colbert realized that the chief\r\nobject of a minister of finance should be the increase of the national\r\nwealth. Hence he tried in every way to foster manufactures and commerce.\r\nAmong other measures Colbert placed heavy duties on the importation of\r\nforeign products, as a means of protecting the \"infant industries\" of\r\nFrance. This was the inauguration of the protective system, since followed\r\nby many European countries and from Europe introduced into America.\r\nColbert regarded protectionism as only a temporary device, however, and\r\nspoke of tariffs as crutches by the help of which manufacturers might\r\nlearn to walk and then throw them away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEDAL OF LOUIS XIV\r\nCommemorates the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The obverse bears a\r\nrepresentation of 'Louis the Great the Most Christian King' the reverse\r\ncontains a legend meaning \"Heresy Extinguished.\"]\r\n\r\nCOLBERT AND COLONIAL EXPANSION\r\n\r\nColbert shared the erroneous views of most economists of his age in\r\nsupposing that the wealth of a country is measured by the amount of gold\r\nand silver which it possesses. He wished, therefore, to provide the French\r\nwith colonies, where they could obtain the products which they had\r\npreviously been obliged to purchase from the Spaniards, Dutch, and\r\nEnglish. At this time many islands in the West Indies were acquired,\r\nCanada was developed, and Louisiana, the vast territory drained by the\r\nMississippi, was opened up to settlement. France, under Colbert, became\r\none of the leading colonial powers of Europe.\r\n\r\nREVOCATION OF THE EDICT OF NANTES, 1685 A.D.\r\n\r\nAs long as Colbert lived, he kept on good terms with the Huguenots, who\r\nformed such useful and industrious subjects. But Louis hated them as\r\nheretics and suspected them of little love for absolute monarchy. To Louis\r\nreligious unity in the state seemed as necessary as political unity.\r\nAccordingly, he revoked in 1685 A.D. the Edict of Nantes, [8] after the\r\nFrench for almost a century had enjoyed religious toleration. The\r\nHuguenots were allowed to keep their Protestant faith, but their freedom\r\nof worship was taken away and was not restored till the time of the French\r\nRevolution. The Protestants in France to-day are about as numerous, in\r\nproportion to the Roman Catholic population, as they were under Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nEMIGRATION OF THE HUGUENOTS\r\n\r\nThe revocation of the Edict of Nantes resulted in a considerable\r\nemigration of Huguenots from France. What was a loss to that country was a\r\ngain to England and Holland, where the Huguenots settled and where they\r\nintroduced their arts and trades. Prussia, also, profited by the\r\nemigration of the Huguenots. Many of them went to Berlin, and that capital\r\nowed the beginning of its importance to its Huguenot population. Louis by\r\nhis bigotry thus strengthened the chief Protestant foes of France.\r\n\r\nART UNDER LOUIS XIV\r\n\r\nLouis was a generous patron of art. French painters and sculptors led the\r\nworld at this time. One of his architects, Mansard, invented the mansard\r\nroof, which has been largely used in France and other European countries.\r\nThis architectural device makes it possible to provide extra rooms at a\r\nsmall expense, without adding an additional story to the building. Among\r\nthe monuments of Louis's reign are the Hôtel des Invalides, [9] now the\r\ntomb of Napoleon, additions to the Louvre, [10] perhaps the masterpiece of\r\nall modern architecture, and the huge palace of Versailles. Louis also\r\nfounded the Gobelins manufactory, so celebrated for fine carpets,\r\nfurniture, and metal work.\r\n\r\nLITERATURE UNDER LOUIS XIV\r\n\r\nThe long list of French authors who flourished during the reign of Louis\r\nincludes Molière, the greatest of French dramatists, La Fontaine, whose\r\nfables are still popular, Perrault, now remembered for his fairy tales,\r\nand Madame de Sévigné, whose letters are regarded as models of French\r\nprose. Probably the most famous work composed at this time is the\r\n_Memoirs_ of Saint-Simon. It presents an intimate and not very flattering\r\npicture of the \"Grand Monarch\" and his court.\r\n\r\nLEARNING UNDER LOUIS XIV\r\n\r\nLouis and his ministers believed that the government should encourage\r\nresearch and the diffusion of knowledge. Richelieu founded and Colbert\r\nfostered the French Academy. Its forty members, sometimes called the\r\n\"Immortals,\" are chosen for their eminent contributions to language and\r\nliterature. The great dictionary of the French language, on which they\r\nhave labored for more than two centuries, is still unfinished. The academy\r\nnow forms a section of the Institute of France. The patronage of Colbert\r\nalso did much to enrich the National Library at Paris. It contains the\r\nlargest collection of books in the world.\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF LOUIS XIV\r\n\r\nThe brilliant reign of the French king cast its spell upon the rest of\r\nEurope. Kings and princes looked to Louis as the model of what a king\r\nshould be and set themselves to imitate the splendor of his court. During\r\nthis period the French language, manners, dress, art, literature, and\r\nscience became the accepted standards of good society in all civilized\r\nlands. France still retains in large measure the preeminent position which\r\nshe secured under the \"Grand Monarch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n244. THE WARS OF LOUIS XIV\r\n\r\nAMBITIOUS DESIGNS OF LOUIS XIV\r\n\r\nHow unwise it may be to concentrate all authority in the hands of one man\r\nis shown by the melancholy record of the wars of Louis XIV. To aggrandize\r\nFrance and gain fame for himself, Louis plunged his country into a series\r\nof struggles from which it emerged completely exhausted. Like Philip II,\r\nLouis dreamed of dominating all western Europe, but, as in Philip's case,\r\nhis aggressions provoked against him a constantly increasing body of\r\nallies, who in the end proved too strong even for the king's able generals\r\nand fine armies.\r\n\r\nTHE BALANCE OF POWER\r\n\r\nThe union of the smaller and weaker countries of Europe against France\r\nillustrates the principle of the balance of power. According to this\r\nprinciple no state ought to become so strong as to overshadow the rest. In\r\nsuch a case all the others must combine against it and treat it as a\r\ncommon enemy. The maintenance of the balance of power has been a leading\r\nobject of European diplomacy from the time of the Thirty Years' War to the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nFRENCH MILITARISM\r\n\r\nLouis himself lacked military talent and did not take a prominent part in\r\nany campaign. He was served, however, by very able commanders, including\r\nCondé and Turenne. Vauban, an eminent engineer, especially developed the\r\nart of siege craft. It was said of Vauban that he never besieged a\r\nfortress without taking it and never lost one which he defended. Louvois,\r\nthe war minister of the king, recruited, equipped, and provisioned larger\r\nbodies of troops than ever before had appeared on European battlefields.\r\nIt was Louvois who introduced the use of distinctive uniforms for soldiers\r\nand the custom of marching in step. He also established field hospitals\r\nand ambulances and placed camp life on a sanitary basis. The labors of\r\nthese men gave Louis the best standing army of the age.\r\n\r\nTHE RHINE BOUNDARY\r\n\r\nOf the four great wars which filled a large part of Louis's reign, all but\r\nthe last were designed to extend the dominions of France on the east and\r\nnortheast to the Rhine. That river in ancient times had separated Gaul and\r\nGermany, and Louis, as well as Richelieu and Mazarin before him, regarded\r\nit as a natural boundary of France. A beginning in this direction had\r\nalready been made at the close of the Thirty Years' War, when France\r\ngained nearly all of Alsace and secured the recognition of her old claims\r\nto the bishoprics of Metz, Toul, and Verdun in Lorraine. A treaty which\r\nMazarin negotiated with Spain in 1659 A.D. also gave France most of\r\nArtois, as well as part of Flanders. Louis thus had a good basis of\r\nfurther advance through Lorraine and the Netherlands to the Rhine.\r\n\r\nTWO WARS FOR THE RHINE, 1667-1678 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe French king began his aggressions by an effort to annex the Belgian or\r\nSpanish Netherlands, which then belonged to Spain. [11] A triple alliance\r\nof Holland, England, and Sweden forced him to relinquish all his\r\nconquests, except a few frontier towns (1668 A.D.). Louis blamed the Dutch\r\nfor his setback, and determined to punish them. Moreover, the Dutch\r\nrepresented everything to which he was opposed, for Holland was a\r\nrepublic, the keen rival of France in trade, and Protestant in religion.\r\nBy skillful diplomacy he persuaded England and Sweden to stand aloof,\r\nwhile his armies entered Holland and drew near to Amsterdam At this\r\ncritical moment William, Prince of Orange, became the Dutch leader. He was\r\na descendant of that William the Silent, who, a century before, had saved\r\nthe Dutch out of the hands of Spain. When urged to submit, seeing that his\r\ncountry was surely lost, William replied, \"I know one way of never seeing\r\nit, and that way is to die on the last dike.\" By William's orders the\r\nDutch cut the dikes and interposed a watery barrier to further advance by\r\nthe French. Then he formed another Continental coalition, which carried on\r\nthe war till Louis signified his desire for peace. The Dutch did not lose\r\na foot of territory, but Spain was obliged to cede to France the important\r\nprovince of Franche Comté (1678 A.D.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, ACQUISITIONS OF LOUIS XIV AND LOUIS XV]\r\n\r\nA THIRD WAR, 1689-1697 A.D.\r\n\r\nTen years later Louis again sought to gain additional territory along the\r\nRhine, but again an alliance of Spain, Holland, England, and the Holy\r\nRoman Empire compelled 1689-1697 him to sue for peace (1697 A.D.). [12]\r\nDuring the course of the war the French inflicted a frightful devastation\r\non the Rhenish Palatinate, so that it might not support armies for the\r\ninvasion of France. Twelve hundred towns and villages were destroyed, and\r\nthe countryside was laid waste. The responsibility for this barbarous act\r\nrests upon Louvois who advised it and Louis who allowed it.\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH SUCCESSION\r\n\r\nThus far the European balance of power had been preserved, but it was now\r\nthreatened in another direction. Charles II, the king of Spain, lay dying,\r\nand as he was without children or brothers to succeed him, all Europe\r\nwondered what would be the fate of his vast possessions in Europe and\r\nAmerica. Louis had married one of his sisters, and the Holy Roman Emperor\r\nanother, so both the Bourbons and the Austrian Hapsburgs could put forth\r\nclaims to the Spanish throne. When Charles died, it was found that he had\r\nleft his entire dominions to Philip of Anjou, one of Louis's grandsons, in\r\nthe hope that the power of France might be great enough to keep them\r\nundivided. Though Louis knew that acceptance of the inheritance would\r\ninvolve a war with Austria and probably with England, whose king was now\r\nLouis's old foe, William of Orange, [13] ambition triumphed over fear and\r\nthe desire for glory over consideration for the welfare of France. At\r\nVersailles Louis proudly presented his grandson to the court, saying,\r\n\"Gentlemen, behold the king of Spain.\"\r\n\r\nWAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION, 1702-1713 A.D.\r\n\r\nIn the War of the Spanish Succession France and Spain faced the Grand\r\nAlliance, which included England, Holland, Austria, several of the German\r\nstates, and Portugal. Europe had never known a war that concerned so many\r\ncountries and peoples. The English ruler, William III, died shortly after\r\nthe outbreak of hostilities, leaving the continuance of the contest as a\r\nlegacy to his sister-in-law, Queen Anne. [14] England supplied the\r\ncoalition with funds, a fleet, and also with the ablest commander of the\r\nage, the duke of Marlborough. In Eugène, prince of Savoy, the allies had\r\nanother skillful and daring general. The great victory gained by them at\r\nBlenheim in 1704 A.D. was the first of a series of successes which finally\r\ndrove the French out of Germany and Italy and opened the road to Paris.\r\nBut dissensions among the allies and the heroic resistance of France and\r\nSpain enabled Louis to hold the enemy at bay, until the exhaustion of both\r\nsides led to the conclusion of the Peace of Utrecht.\r\n\r\nPEACE OF UTRECHT, 1713 A.D.\r\n\r\nThis peace ranks with that of Westphalia among the most important\r\ndiplomatic arrangements of modern times. First, Louis's grandson, Philip\r\nV, was recognized as king of Spain and her colonies, on condition that the\r\nSpanish and French crowns should never be united. Since this time Bourbon\r\nsovereigns have continued to rule in Spain. Next, the Austrian Hapsburgs\r\ngained most of the Spanish dominions in Italy, as well as the Belgian or\r\nSpanish Netherlands (henceforth for a century called the Austrian\r\nNetherlands). Finally, England obtained from France possessions in North\r\nAmerica, and from Spain the island of Minorca and the rock of Gibraltar,\r\ncommanding the narrow entrance to the Mediterranean. England has never\r\nsince relaxed her hold upon Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nBRANDENBURG AND PRUSSIA\r\n\r\nTwo of the smaller members of the Grand Alliance likewise profited by the\r\nPeace of Utrecht. The right of the elector of Brandenburg to enjoy the\r\ntitle of king of Prussia was acknowledged. This formed an important step\r\nin the fortunes of the Hohenzollern [15] dynasty, which to-day rules over\r\nGermany. The duchy of Savoy also became a kingdom and received the island\r\nof Sicily (shortly afterwards exchanged for Sardinia). The house of Savoy\r\nin the nineteenth century provided Italy with its present reigning family.\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF FRANCE\r\n\r\nFrance lost far less by the war than at one time seemed probable. Louis\r\ngave up his dream of dominating Europe, but he kept all the Continental\r\nacquisitions made earlier in his reign. And yet the price of the king's\r\nwarlike policy had been a heavy one. France paid it in the shape of famine\r\nand pestilence, excessive taxes, heavy debts, and the impoverishment of\r\nthe people. Louis, now a very old man, survived the Peace of Utrecht only\r\ntwo years. As he lay on his deathbed, the king turned to his little heir\r\n[16] and said, \"Try to keep peace with your neighbors. I have been too\r\nfond of war; do not imitate me in that, nor in my too great expenditure.\"\r\nThese words of the dying king showed an appreciation of the errors which\r\nrobbed his long reign of much of its glory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARLBOROUGH\r\nA miniature in the possession of the Duke of Buccleugh.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, EUROPE after the Peace of Utrecht, 1713 A.D.].\r\n\r\n\r\n245. THE ABSOLUTISM OF THE STUARTS, 1603-1642 A.D.\r\n\r\nTUDOR ABSOLUTISM\r\n\r\nDuring the same century which saw the triumph of absolutism and divine\r\nright in France, a successful struggle took place in England against the\r\nunlimited power of kings. Absolutism in England dated from the time of the\r\nTudors. Henry VII humbled the nobles, while Henry VIII and Elizabeth\r\nbrought the Church into dependence on the crown. [17] These three\r\nsovereigns were strong and forceful, but they were also excellent rulers\r\nand popular with the influential middle class in town and country. The\r\nTudors gave England order and prosperity, if not political liberty.\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENT UNDER THE TUDORS\r\n\r\nThe English Parliament in the thirteenth century had become a body\r\nrepresentative of all classes of the people, and in the fourteenth century\r\nit had separated into the two houses of Lords and Commons. [18] Parliament\r\nenjoyed considerable authority at this time. The kings, who were in\r\ncontinual need of money, summoned it frequently, sought its advice upon\r\nimportant questions, and readily listened to its requests. The despotic\r\nTudors, on the other hand, made Parliament their servant. Henry VII called\r\nit together on only five occasions during his reign; Henry VIII persuaded\r\nor frightened it into doing anything he pleased; and Elizabeth seldom\r\nconsulted it. Parliament under the Tudors did not abandon its old claims\r\nto a share in the government, but it had little chance to exercise them.\r\n\r\nJAMES I, KING, 1603-1625 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe death of Elizabeth in 1603 A.D. ended the Tudor dynasty and placed the\r\nStuarts on the English throne in the person of James I. [19] England and\r\nScotland were now joined in a personal union, though each country retained\r\nits own Parliament, laws, and state Church. The new king was well\r\ndescribed by a contemporary as the \"wisest fool in Christendom.\" He had a\r\ngood mind and abundant learning, but throughout his reign he showed an\r\nutter inability to win either the esteem or the affection of his subjects.\r\nThis was a misfortune, for the English had now grown weary of despotism\r\nand wanted more freedom. They were not prepared to tolerate in James, an\r\nalien, many things which they had overlooked in \"Good Queen Bess.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES I ON DIVINE RIGHT\r\n\r\nOne of the most fruitful sources of discord between James and the English\r\npeople was his exalted conception of monarchy. The Tudors, indeed, claimed\r\nto rule by divine right, but James went further than they in arguing for\r\ndivine _hereditary_ right. Providence, James declared, had chosen the\r\nprinciple of heredity in order to fix the succession to the throne. This\r\nprinciple, being divine, lay beyond the power of man to alter. Whether the\r\nking was fit or unfit to rule, Parliament might not change the succession,\r\ndepose a sovereign, or limit his authority in any way. James rather neatly\r\nsummarized his views in a Latin epigram, _a deo rex, a rege lex_--\"the\r\nking is from God and law is from the king.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLD COIN OF JAMES I.\r\nThe first coin to bear the legend \"Great Britain\".]\r\n\r\nJAMES I AND PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, the extreme pretensions of James encountered much\r\nopposition from Parliament. That body felt little sympathy for a ruler who\r\nproclaimed himself the source of all law. When James, always extravagant\r\nand a poor financier, came before it for money, Parliament insisted on its\r\nright to withhold supplies until grievances were redressed. James would\r\nnot yield, and got along as best he could by levying customs duties,\r\nselling titles of nobility, and imposing excessive fines, in spite of the\r\nprotests of Parliament. This situation continued to the end of the king's\r\nreign.\r\n\r\nJAMES I AND PURITANISM\r\n\r\nA religious controversy helped to embitter the dispute between James and\r\nParliament. The king, who was Puritanism a devout Anglican, made himself\r\nvery unpopular with the Puritans, as the reformers within the Church of\r\nEngland were called. The Puritans had no intention of separating from the\r\nnational or established Church, but they wished to \"purify\" it of certain\r\ncustoms which they described as \"Romish\" or \"papist.\" Among these were the\r\nuse of the surplice, of the ring in the marriage service, and of the sign\r\nof the cross in baptism. Some Puritans wanted to get rid of the _Book of\r\nCommon Prayer_ altogether. The Puritans were distinguished by their\r\naustere lives. They looked with disfavor on May Day and Christmas\r\nfestivities, observed the Jewish Sabbath in all its rigor, and condemned\r\nthe Anglicans who played games and danced upon the village green on\r\nSundays. As the Puritans had a large majority in the House of Commons, it\r\nwas inevitable that the parliamentary struggle against Stuart absolutism\r\nwould assume in part a religious character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PURITAN FAMILY\r\nIllustration in an edition of the _Psalms_ published in 1563 A.D.]\r\n\r\nCHARLES I, KING, 1625-1649 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe political and religious difficulties which marked the reign of James I\r\ndid not disappear when his son, Charles I, came to the throne. Charles was\r\na true Stuart in his devotion to absolutism and divine right. Almost\r\nimmediately he began to quarrel with Parliament. When that body withheld\r\nsupplies, Charles resorted to forced loans from the wealthy and even\r\nimprisoned a number of persons who refused to contribute. Such arbitrary\r\nacts showed plainly that Charles would play the tyrant if he could.\r\n\r\nPETITION OF RIGHT, 1628 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe king's attitude at last led Parliament to a bold assertion of its\r\nauthority. It now presented to Charles the celebrated Petition of Right.\r\nOne of the most important clauses provided that forced loans without\r\nparliamentary sanction should be considered illegal. Another clause\r\ndeclared that no one should be arrested or imprisoned except according to\r\nthe law of the land. The Petition thus repeated and reinforced two of the\r\nleading principles of Magna Carta. [20] The people of England, speaking\r\nthis time through their elected representatives, asserted once more their\r\nright to limit the power of kings.\r\n\r\nPERSONAL RULE OF CHARLES I, 1629-1640 A.D.\r\n\r\nCharles signed the Petition, as the only means of securing parliamentary\r\nconsent to taxation; but he had no intention of observing it. For the next\r\neleven years he managed to govern without calling Parliament in session.\r\nThe conduct of affairs during this period lay largely in the hands of Sir\r\nThomas Wentworth, afterwards earl of Strafford, and William Laud, who\r\nlater became archbishop of Canterbury. The king made these two men his\r\nprincipal advisers and through them carried on his despotic rule.\r\nArbitrary courts, which tried cases without a jury, punished those who\r\nresisted the royal will. A rigid censorship of the press prevented any\r\nexpression of popular discontent. Public meetings were suppressed as\r\nseditious riots. Even private gatherings were dangerous, for the king had\r\nswarms of spies to report any disloyal acts or utterances.\r\n\r\nJOHN HAMPDEN AND \"SHIP-MONEY\"\r\n\r\nSince Charles ruled without a Parliament, he had to adopt all sorts of\r\ndevices to fill his treasury. One of these was the levying of \"ship-\r\nmoney.\" According to an old custom, seaboard towns and counties had been\r\nrequired to provide ships or money for the royal navy. Charles revived\r\nthis custom and extended it to towns and counties lying inland. It seemed\r\nclear that the king meant to impose a permanent tax on all England without\r\nthe assent of Parliament. The demand for \"ship-money\" aroused much\r\nopposition, and John Hampden, a wealthy squire of Buckinghamshire, refused\r\nto pay the twenty shillings levied on his estate. Hampden was tried before\r\na court of the royal judges and was convicted by a bare majority. He\r\nbecame, however, the hero of the hour. The England people recognized in\r\nhim one who had dared, for the sake of principle, to protest against the\r\nking's despotic rule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES I\r\nA painting by Daniel Mytens in the National Portrait Gallery. London]\r\n\r\nLAUD'S ECCLESIASTICAL POLICY\r\n\r\nArchbishop Laud, the king's chief agent in ecclesiastical matters,\r\ndetested Puritanism and aimed to root it out from the Church of England.\r\nHe put no Puritans to death, but he sanctioned cruel punishments of those\r\nwho would not conform to the established Church. All that the dungeon and\r\nthe pillory, mutilation and loss of position, could do to break their will\r\nwas done. While the restrictions on Puritans were increased, those\r\naffecting Roman Catholics were relaxed. Many people thought that Charles,\r\nthrough Laud and the bishops, was preparing to lead the Church of England\r\nback to Rome. They therefore opposed the king on religious grounds, as\r\nwell as for political reasons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXECUTION OF THE EARL OF STRAFFORD\r\nAfter a contemporary print. The Tower of London is seen in the\r\nbackground.]\r\n\r\nTHE LONG PARLIAMENT, 1640 A.D.\r\n\r\nBut the personal rule of Charles was now drawing to an end. In 1637 A.D.\r\nthe king, supported by Archbishop Laud, tried The Long to introduce a\r\nmodified form of the English prayer book into Scotland. The Scotch,\r\nPresbyterian [21] to the core, drew up a national oath, or Covenant, by\r\nwhich they bound themselves to resist any attempt to change their\r\nreligion. Rebellion quickly passed into open war, and the Covenanters\r\ninvaded northern England. Charles, helpless, with a seditious army and an\r\nempty treasury, had to summon Parliament in session. It met in 1640 A.D.\r\nand did not formally dissolve till twenty years later. Hence it has\r\nreceived the name of the Long Parliament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, ENGLAND AND WALES--THE CIVIL WARS OF THE 17TH CENTURY]\r\n\r\nREFORMS OF THE LONG PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\nThe Long Parliament no sooner assembled than it assumed the conduct of\r\ngovernment. The leaders, including John Hampden, John Pym, and Oliver\r\nCromwell, openly declared that the House of Commons, and not the king,\r\npossessed supreme authority in the state. Parliament began by executing\r\nStrafford and subsequently Laud, thus emphasizing the responsibility of\r\nministers to Parliament. Next, it abolished Star Chamber and other special\r\ncourts, which had become engines of royal oppression. It forbade the\r\nlevying of \"ship-money\" and other irregular taxes. It took away the king's\r\nright of dissolving Parliament at his pleasure and ordered that at least\r\none parliamentary session should be held every three years. These measures\r\nstripped the crown of the despotic powers acquired by the Tudors and the\r\nStuarts.\r\n\r\n\r\n246. OLIVER CROMWELL AND THE CIVIL WAR, 1642-1649 A.D.\r\n\r\nOUTBREAK OF THE GREAT REBELLION, 1642 A.D.\r\n\r\nThus far, the Long Parliament had acted along the line of reformation\r\nrather than revolution. Had Charles been content to accept the new\r\narrangements, there would have been little more trouble. But the proud and\r\nimperious king was only watching his chance to strike a blow at\r\nParliament. Taking advantage of some differences in opinion among its\r\nmembers, Charles summoned his soldiers, marched to Westminister, and\r\ndemanded the surrender of five leaders, including Pym and Hampden. Warned\r\nin time, they made their escape, and Charles did not find them in the\r\nchamber of the Commons. \"Well, I see all the birds are flown,\" he\r\nexclaimed, and walked out baffled. The king's attempt to intimidate the\r\nCommons was a great blunder. It showed beyond doubt that he would resort\r\nto force, rather than bend his neck to Parliament. Both Charles and\r\nParliament now began to gather troops and prepare for the inevitable\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\n\"CAVALIERS\" AND \"ROUND-HEADS\"\r\n\r\nThe opposing parties seemed to be very evenly matched. Around the king\r\nrallied nearly all of the nobles, the Anglican clergy, the Roman\r\nCatholics, a majority of the \"squires,\" or country gentry, and the members\r\nof the universities. The royalists received the name of \"Cavaliers.\" The\r\nparliamentarians, or \"Roundheads,\" [22] were mostly recruited from the\r\ntrading classes in the towns and the small landowners in the country. The\r\nworking people remained as a rule indifferent and took little part in the\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLIVER CROMWELL\r\nA painting by Robert Walker, in the National Portrait Gallery, London.]\r\n\r\nOLIVER CROMWELL, 1599-1658 A.D.\r\n\r\nBoth Pym and Hampden died in the second year of the war, and henceforth\r\nthe leadership of the parliamentary party fell to Oliver Cromwell. He was\r\na country gentleman from the east of England, and Hampden's cousin.\r\nCromwell represented the university of Cambridge in the Long Parliament\r\nand displayed there great audacity in opposing the government. An\r\nunfriendly critic at this time describes \"his countenance swollen and\r\nreddish, his voice sharp and untuneable, and his eloquence full of\r\nfervor.\" Though a zealous Puritan, who believed himself in all sincerity\r\nto be the chosen agent of the Lord, Cromwell was not an ascetic. He\r\nhunted, hawked, played bowls, and other games, had an ear for music, and\r\nvalued art and learning. In public life he showed himself a statesman of\r\nmuch insight and a military genius.\r\n\r\nTHE \"IRONSIDES\" AND THE \"NEW MODEL\"\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the war fortune favored the royalists, until Cromwell\r\ntook the field. To him was due the formation of a cavalry regiment of\r\n\"honest, sober Christians,\" whose watchwords were texts from Scripture and\r\nwho charged in battle while singing psalms. These \"Ironsides,\" as Cromwell\r\nsaid, \"had the fear of God before them and made some conscience of what\r\nthey did.\" They were so successful that Parliament permitted Cromwell to\r\nreorganize a large part of the army into the \"New Model,\" a body of\r\nprofessional, highly disciplined soldiers. The \"New Model\" defeated\r\nCharles decisively at the battle of Naseby, near the center of England\r\n(1645 A.D.). Charles then surrendered to the Scotch, who soon turned him\r\nover to Parliament.\r\n\r\nPRESYBTERIANS AND INDEPENDENTS\r\n\r\nThe surrender of the king ended the Great Rebellion, but left the\r\npolitical situation in doubt. By this time the Puritans had divided into\r\ntwo rival parties. The Presbyterians wished to make the Church of England,\r\nlike that of Scotland, Presbyterian in faith and worship. Through their\r\ncontrol of Parliament, they were able to pass acts doing away with\r\nbishops, forbidding the use of the _Book of Common Prayer_, and requiring\r\nevery one to accept Presbyterian doctrines. The other Puritan party, known\r\nas the Independents, [23] felt that religious beliefs should not be a\r\nmatter of compulsion. They rejected both Anglicanism and Presbyterianism\r\nand desired to set up churches of their own, where they might worship as\r\nseemed to them right. The Independents had the powerful backing of\r\nCromwell and the \"New Model,\" so that the stage was set for a quarrel\r\nbetween Parliament and the army.\r\n\r\n\"PRIDE'S PURGE,\" 1648 A.D.\r\n\r\nKing Charles, though a prisoner in the hands of his enemies, hoped to find\r\nprofit in their divisions. The Presbyterian majority in the House of\r\nCommons was willing to restore the king, provided he would give his assent\r\nto the establishment of Presbyterianism in England. But the army wanted no\r\nreconciliation with the captive monarch and at length took matters into\r\nits own hand. A party of soldiers, under the command of a Colonel Pride,\r\nexcluded the Presbyterian members from the floor of the House, leaving the\r\nIndependents alone to conduct the government. This action is known as\r\n\"Pride's Purge.\" Cromwell approved of it, and from this time he became the\r\nreal ruler of England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF WESTMINSTER HALL\r\nNext to the Tower and the Abbey Westminster Hall adjoining the Houses of\r\nParliament, is the most historic building in London. The hall was begun by\r\nWilliam Rufus in 1097 A.D. and was enlarged by his successors. Richard II\r\nin 1397 A.D. added the great oak roof, which has lasted to this day Here\r\nwere held the trials of Stafford and Charles I.]\r\n\r\nEXECUTION OF CHARLES I, 1649 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe \"Rump Parliament,\" as the remnant of the House of Commons was called,\r\nimmediately brought the king before a High Court of Justice composed of\r\nhis bitterest enemies. He refused to acknowledge the right of the court to\r\ntry him and made no defense whatever. Charles was speedily convicted and\r\nsentenced to be beheaded, \"as a tyrant, traitor, murderer, and public\r\nenemy to the good of the people.\" He met death with quiet dignity and\r\ncourage on a scaffold erected in front of Whitehall Palace in London. The\r\nking's execution went far beyond the wishes of most Englishmen; \"cruel\r\nnecessity\" formed its only justification; but it established once for all\r\nin England the principle that rulers are responsible to their subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n247. THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE PROTECTORATE, 1649-1660 A.D.\r\n\r\nENGLAND A REPUBLIC\r\n\r\nShortly after the execution of Charles I the \"Rump Parliament\" abolished\r\nthe House of Lords and the office of king. It named a Council of State,\r\nmost of whose members were chosen from the House of Commons, to carry on\r\nthe government. England now became a commonwealth, or national republic,\r\nthe first in the history of the world. It is clear that this republic was\r\nthe creation of a minority. The Anglicans, the Presbyterians, and the\r\nRoman Catholics were willing to restore the monarchy, but as long as the\r\npower lay with the army, the small sect of Independents could impose its\r\nwill on the great majority of the English people.\r\n\r\nSUBJECTION OF IRELAND\r\n\r\nBesides confusion and discontent at home, many dangers confronted the\r\nCommonwealth abroad. In both Ireland and Scotland Prince Charles, the\r\noldest son of the dead sovereign, had been proclaimed king. But Cromwell\r\nrose to the emergency. Invading Ireland with his trained soldiers, he\r\ncaptured town after town, slaughtered many royalists, and shipped many\r\nmore to the West Indies as slaves. This time Ireland was completely\r\nsubdued, at a cost, from fighting, famine, and pestilence, of the lives of\r\na third of its population. Cromwell confiscated the land of those who had\r\nsupported the royalist cause and planted colonies of English Protestants\r\nin Ulster, Leinster, and Munster. The Roman Catholic gentry were compelled\r\nto remove beyond the Shannon River to unfruitful Connaught. Even there the\r\npublic exercise of their religion was forbidden them. Cromwell's harsh\r\nmeasures brought peace to Ireland, but only intensified the hatred felt by\r\nIrish Roman Catholics for Protestant England. [24]\r\n\r\nSCOTLAND SUBDUED\r\n\r\nWhile Cromwell was still in Ireland, Prince Charles, who had been living\r\nas an exile at the French court, came to Scotland. On his promise to be a\r\nPresbyterian king the whole nation agreed to support him. Cromwell, in two\r\npitched battles, broke up the Scotch armies and compelled Prince Charles\r\nto seek safety in flight. After thrilling adventures the prince managed to\r\nreach his asylum in France. Cromwell treated the Scotch with leniency, but\r\ntook away their Parliament and united their country with England in a\r\nsingle state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map, IRELAND In the 16th Century]\r\n\r\nDISSOLUTION OF THE \"RUMP PARLIAMENT,\" 1653 A.D.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the \"Rump Parliament\" had become more and more unpopular. The\r\narmy, which had saved England from Stuart despotism, did not relish the\r\nspectacle of a small group of men, many of them selfish and corrupt,\r\npresuming to govern the country Cromwell found them \"horridly arbitrary\"\r\nand at last resolved to have done with them. He entered the House of\r\nCommons with a band of musketeers and ordered the members home. \"Come,\r\ncome,\" he cried, \"I will put an end to your prating. You are no\r\nParliament, I say you are no Parliament. I will put an end to your\r\nsitting.\" Another Parliament, chosen by Cromwell and the army, proved\r\nequally incapable. After a few months' rule it resigned its authority into\r\nthe hands of Cromwell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT SEAL OF ENGLAND UNDER THE COMMONWEALTH (REDUCED)\r\nThe reverse represents the House of Commons in session.]\r\n\r\nTHE INSTRUMENT OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nBy force of circumstances Cromwell had become a virtual dictator, but he\r\nhad no love of absolute power. He therefore accepted a so-called\r\nInstrument of Government, drawn up by some of his officers. It provided\r\nthat Cromwell should be Lord Protector for life, with the assistance of a\r\ncouncil and a Parliament. The Instrument is notable as the first written\r\nconstitution of a modern nation. It is the only one which England has ever\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nCROMWELL AS LORD PROTECTOR, 1653-1658 A.D.\r\n\r\nAs Lord Protector in name, though a king in fact, Cromwell ruled England\r\nfor five years. He got along with Parliament no better than the Stuarts\r\nhad done, but his successful conduct of foreign affairs gave England an\r\nimportance in the councils of Europe which it had not enjoyed since the\r\ntime of Elizabeth. Cromwell died in 1658 A.D. Two years later the nation,\r\nweary of military rule, restored Charles II to the throne of his\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nTHE PURITAN REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nIt seemed, indeed, as if the Puritan Revolution had been a complete\r\nfailure. But this was hardly true. The revolution arrested the growth of\r\nabsolutism in England. It created among Englishmen a lasting hostility to\r\nabsolute power, whether exercised by King, Parliament, Protector, or army.\r\nAnd, furthermore, it sent forth into the world ideas of political liberty,\r\nwhich, during the eighteenth century, helped to produce the American and\r\nFrench revolutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n248. THE RESTORATION AND THE \"GLORIOUS REVOLUTION,\" 1660-1689 A.D.\r\n\r\nREIGN OF CHARLES II, 1660-1685 A.D.\r\n\r\nCharles II, on mounting the throne, pledged himself to maintain Magna\r\nCarta, the Petition of Right, and other statutes limiting the royal power.\r\nThe people of England wished to be governed by the king, but they also\r\nwished that the king should govern by the advice of Parliament. Charles,\r\nless obstinate and more astute than his father, recognized this fact, and,\r\nwhen a conflict threatened with his ministers or Parliament, always\r\navoided it by timely concessions. Whatever happened, he used to say, he\r\nwas resolved \"never to set on his travels again.\" Charles's charm of\r\nmanner, wit, and genial humor made him a popular monarch, in spite of his\r\ngrave faults of character. One of his own courtiers well described him as\r\na king who \"never said a foolish thing and never did a wise one.\"\r\n\r\nREACTION AGAINST PURITANISM\r\n\r\nThe period of the Restoration was characterized by a reaction against the\r\naustere scheme of life which the Puritans had imposed on society.\r\nPuritanism not only deprived the people of evil pleasures, such as bear-\r\nbaiting, Cock-fighting, and tippling, but it also prohibited the Sunday\r\ndances and games, the village festivals, and the popular drama. When\r\nPuritanism disappeared, the people went to the opposite extreme and cast\r\noff all restraint. In this the king, who had lived long at the gay court\r\nof Louis XIV, set the example. England was nevermore merry and never less\r\nmoral than under its \"Merry Monarch.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOYS' SPORTS\r\nFrom a book of 1659 A.D.]\r\n\r\nTHE DISSENTERS\r\n\r\nThe Restoration brought back the Church of England, together with the\r\nStuarts. Parliament, more intolerant than the king, passed an Act of\r\nUniformity, which made the use of the _Book of Common Prayer_ compulsory\r\nand required all ministers to express their consent to everything\r\ncontained in it. Nearly two thousand clergymen resigned their positions\r\nrather than obey the act. Among them were found Presbyterians,\r\nIndependents (or Congregationalists), Baptists, and Quakers. These\r\nPuritans, since they did not accept the national Church, were henceforth\r\nclassed as Dissenters. [25] They might not hold meetings for worship, or\r\nteach in schools, or accept any public office. For many years the\r\nDissenters had to endure harsh persecution.\r\n\r\nHABEAS CORPUS ACT, 1679 A.D.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important events belonging to the reign of Charles II was\r\nthe passage by Parliament of the Habeas Corpus Act. The writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus_ [26] is an order, issued by a judge, requiring a person held in\r\ncustody to be brought before the court. If upon examination there appears\r\nto be good reason for keeping the prisoner, he is to be remanded for\r\ntrial; otherwise he is to be freed or released on bail. This writ had been\r\nlong used in England, and one of the clauses of Magna Carta expressly\r\nprovided against arbitrary imprisonment. It had always been possible,\r\nhowever, for the king or his ministers to order the arrest of a person\r\nconsidered dangerous to the state, without making any formal charge\r\nagainst him. The Habeas Corpus Act established the principle that every\r\nman, not charged with or convicted of a known crime, is entitled to\r\npersonal freedom. Most of the British possessions where the Common law\r\nprevails have accepted the act, and it has been adopted by the federal and\r\nstate legislatures of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILVER CROWN OF CHARLES II]\r\n\r\nWHIGS AND TORIES\r\n\r\nThe reign of Charles II also saw the beginning of the modern party system\r\nin Parliament. Two opposing parties took shape, very largely out of a\r\nreligious controversy. The king, from his long life in France, had become\r\npartial to Roman Catholicism, though he did not formally embrace that\r\nfaith until at the moment of death. His brother James, the heir to the\r\nthrone, became an open Roman Catholic, however, much to the disgust of\r\nmany members of Parliament. A bill was now brought forward to exclude\r\nPrince James from the succession, because of his conversion. Its\r\nsupporters received the nickname of Whigs, while those who opposed it were\r\ncalled Tories. [27] The bill did not pass the House of Lords, but the two\r\nparties in Parliament continued to divide on other questions. They survive\r\nto-day as the Liberals and the Conservatives, and still dispute the\r\ngovernment of England between them.\r\n\r\nREIGN OF JAMES II, 1685-1688 A.D.\r\n\r\nJames II was without the attractive personality which had made his brother\r\na popular ruler; moreover, he was an avowed Roman Catholic and a staunch\r\nbeliever in the divine right of kings. During his three years' reign,\r\nJames managed to make enemies of most of his Protestant subjects. He\r\n\"suspended\" the laws against Roman Catholics and appointed them to\r\npositions of authority and influence. James also dismissed Parliament and\r\nsupported himself with subsidies from Louis XIV. At last a number of Whig\r\nand Tory leaders, representing both parties in Parliament, invited that\r\nsturdy Protestant, William of Orange, [28] to rescue England from Stuart\r\nabsolutism.\r\n\r\nACCESSION OF WILLIAM AND MARY, 1689 A.D.\r\n\r\nWilliam landed in England with a small army and marched unopposed to\r\nLondon. The wretched king, deserted by his courtiers and his soldiers,\r\nsoon found himself Harness alone. He fled to France, where he lived the\r\nremainder of his days as a pensioner at the court of Louis XIV. Parliament\r\ngranted the throne conjointly to William and Mary, William to rule during\r\nhis lifetime and Mary to have the succession, should she survive him.\r\n\r\nTHE BILL OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\nIn settling the crown on William and Mary, Parliament took care to\r\nsafeguard its own authority and the of Protestant religion. It enacted the\r\nBill of Rights, which has a place by the side of Magna Carta and the\r\nPetition of Right among the great documents of English constitutional\r\nhistory. This act decreed that the sovereign must henceforth be a member\r\nof the Anglican Church. It forbade the sovereign to \"suspend\" the\r\noperation of the laws, or to levy money or maintain a standing army except\r\nby consent of Parliament. It also declared that election of members of\r\nParliament ought to be free; that they ought to enjoy freedom of speech\r\nand action within the two Houses; and that excessive bail ought not to be\r\nrequired, or excessive fines imposed, or cruel and unusual punishments\r\ninflicted. Finally, it affirmed the right of subjects to petition the\r\nsovereign and ordered the holding of frequent Parliaments. These were not\r\nnew principles of political liberty, but now the English people were\r\nstrong enough not only to assert, but also to uphold them. They reappear\r\nin the first ten amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nTHE TOLERATION ACT\r\n\r\nAt this time, also, England took an important step in the direction of\r\nreligious liberty. Parliament passed a Toleration Act, conceding to the\r\nDissenters the right of worship, though not the right of holding any civil\r\nor military office. The Dissenters might now serve their God as they\r\npleased, without fear of persecution. Unitarians and Roman Catholics, as\r\nwell as Jews, were expressly excluded from the benefits of the act. The\r\npassage of this measure did much to remove religion from English politics\r\nas a vital issue.\r\n\r\nTHE \"GLORIOUS REVOLUTION\"\r\n\r\nThe revolution of 1688-89 A.D. thus struck a final blow at absolutism and\r\ndivine right in England. An English king became henceforth the servant of\r\nParliament, holding office only on good behavior. An act of Parliament had\r\nmade him and an act of Parliament might depose him. It is well to\r\nremember, however, that the revolution was not a popular movement. It was\r\na successful struggle for parliamentary supremacy on the part of the upper\r\nand middle classes--the nobles, squires, merchants, and clergy. England\r\nnow had a \"limited\" or \"constitutional\" monarchy controlled by the\r\naristocracy. Not till the nineteenth century did the common people succeed\r\nin establishing a really democratic government in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n249. ENGLAND IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\nSOCIAL ENGLAND\r\n\r\nThe population of England at the close of the seventeenth century exceeded\r\nfive millions, of whom at least two-thirds lived in the country. Except\r\nfor London there were only four towns of more than ten thousand\r\ninhabitants. London counted half a million people within its limits and\r\nhad become the largest city in Europe. Town life still wore a medieval\r\nlook, but the increase of wealth gradually introduced many new comforts\r\nand luxuries. Coal came into use instead of charcoal; tea, coffee, and\r\nchocolate competed with wine, ale, and beer as beverages; the first\r\nnewspapers appeared, generally in weekly editions; amusements multiplied;\r\nand passenger coaches began to ply between London and the provincial\r\ncenters. The highways, however, were wretched and infested with robbers.\r\nThe traveler found some recompense for the hardships of a journey in the\r\ncountry inns, famous for their plenty and good cheer. The transport of\r\ngoods was chiefly by means of pack horses, because of the poor roads and\r\nthe absence of canals. Postal arrangements also remained very primitive,\r\nand in remote country districts letters were not delivered more than once\r\na week. The difficulties of travel and communication naturally made for\r\nisolation; and country people, except the wealthy, rarely visited the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LONDON BELLMAN\r\nTitle-page of a tract published in 1616 A.D. It was part of the duties of\r\na bellman, or night-watchman, to call out the hours, the state of the\r\nweather, and other information as he passed by.]\r\n\r\nECONOMIC ENGLAND\r\n\r\nAs the population of England increased, old industries developed and new\r\nones sprang up. The chief manufacture was that of wool, while that of silk\r\nflourished after the influx of Huguenots which followed the revocation\r\n[29] of the Edict of Nantes. The absence of large textile mills made it\r\nnecessary to carry on spinning and weaving in the homes of the operatives.\r\nThe vast mineral deposits, which in later times became the main source of\r\nEngland's prosperity, were then little worked. Farming and the raising of\r\nsheep and cattle still remained the principal occupations. But agriculture\r\nwas retarded by the old system of common tillage and open fields, just as\r\nindustry was fettered by the trade monopoly of the craft guilds. These\r\nsurvivals of the Middle Ages had not yet disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COACH AND SEDAN CHAIR\r\nTitle-page of a tract published in 1636 A.D.]\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC PROGRESS\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth century in England saw a notable advance in science. At\r\nthis time Harvey revealed the circulation of the blood. [30] Napier, a\r\nScotchman, invented logarithms, which lie at the basis of the higher\r\nmathematics. Boyle, an Irishman, has been called the \"father of modern\r\nchemistry,\" so many were his researches in that field of knowledge. Far\r\ngreater than any of these men was Sir Isaac Newton, who discovered the law\r\nof gravitation and the differential calculus. During the Civil War a group\r\nof students interested in the natural world began to hold meetings in\r\nLondon and Oxford, and shortly after the Restoration they obtained a\r\ncharter under the name of the Royal Society. It still exists and enrolls\r\namong its members the most distinguished scientists of England. The Royal\r\nObservatory at Greenwich also dates from the period of the Restoration.\r\nAltogether much was being done to uncover the secrets of nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEATH MASK OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON.\r\nIn the possession of the Royal Society of London.]\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF ART\r\n\r\nSeventeenth century England produced no very eminent painters or\r\nsculptors, though foreign artists, such as Rubens and Van Dyck, were\r\nwelcomed there. Among architects the most famous was Sir Christopher Wren,\r\nwho did much to popularize the Renaissance style of building. [31] A great\r\nfire which destroyed most of old London during the reign of Charles II\r\ngave Wren an opportunity to rebuild about fifty parish churches, as well\r\nas St. Paul's Cathedral. His tomb in the crypt of the cathedral bears the\r\nfamous inscription: _Si monumentum requieris, circumspice_: \"If you seek\r\nhis monument, look around you.\"\r\n\r\nLITERATURE\r\n\r\nEnglish literature in the seventeenth century covered many fields.\r\nShakespeare and Bacon, the two chief literary ornaments of the Elizabethan\r\nAge, did some of their best work during the reign of James I. In 1611 A.D.\r\nappeared the Authorized Version of the Bible, sometimes called the King\r\nJames Version because it was dedicated to that monarch. The simplicity,\r\ndignity, and eloquence of this translation have never been excelled, and\r\nit still remains in ordinary use among Protestants throughout the English-\r\nspeaking world. [32] The Puritan poet, John Milton, composed his epic of\r\n_Paradise Lost_ during the reign of Charles II. About the same time\r\nanother Puritan, John Bunyan, wrote the immortal _Pilgrim's Progress_, a\r\nbook which gives an equal though different pleasure to children and\r\nadults, to the ignorant and the learned. But these are only a few of the\r\neminent poets and prose writers of the age.\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\nThus, aside from its political importance, the seventeenth century formed\r\na noteworthy period in English history. England until this time had been,\r\non the whole, a follower rather than a leader of Europe. The defeat of the\r\nSpanish Armada, the overthrow of Stuart absolutism, and the check\r\nadministered to the aggressive designs of Louis XIV were so many\r\nindications that England had risen to a place of first importance in\r\nEuropean affairs. During this century, too, the American colonies of\r\nEngland began to lay the basis for Anglo-Saxon predominance in the New\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES\r\n\r\n1.
