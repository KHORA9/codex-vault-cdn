Their\r\ndispositions tallied. It was the man who had christened the wolf:\r\nprobably he had also chosen his own name. Having found _Ursus_ fit for\r\nhimself, he had found _Homo_ fit for the beast. Man and wolf turned\r\ntheir partnership to account at fairs, at village fêtes, at the corners\r\nof streets where passers-by throng, and out of the need which people\r\nseem to feel everywhere to listen to idle gossip and to buy quack\r\nmedicine. The wolf, gentle and courteously subordinate, diverted the\r\ncrowd. It is a pleasant thing to behold the tameness of animals. Our\r\ngreatest delight is to see all the varieties of domestication parade\r\nbefore us. This it is which collects so many folks on the road of royal\r\nprocessions.\r\n\r\nUrsus and Homo went about from cross-road to cross-road, from the High\r\nStreet of Aberystwith to the High Street of Jedburgh, from country-side\r\nto country-side, from shire to shire, from town to town. One market\r\nexhausted, they went on to another. Ursus lived in a small van upon\r\nwheels, which Homo was civilized enough to draw by day and guard by\r\nnight. On bad roads, up hills, and where there were too many ruts, or\r\nthere was too much mud, the man buckled the trace round his neck and\r\npulled fraternally, side by side with the wolf. They had thus grown old\r\ntogether. They encamped at haphazard on a common, in the glade of a\r\nwood, on the waste patch of grass where roads intersect, at the\r\noutskirts of villages, at the gates of towns, in market-places, in\r\npublic walks, on the borders of parks, before the entrances of churches.\r\nWhen the cart drew up on a fair green, when the gossips ran up\r\nopen-mouthed and the curious made a circle round the pair, Ursus\r\nharangued and Homo approved. Homo, with a bowl in his mouth, politely\r\nmade a collection among the audience. They gained their livelihood. The\r\nwolf was lettered, likewise the man. The wolf had been trained by the\r\nman, or had trained himself unassisted, to divers wolfish arts, which\r\nswelled the receipts. “Above all things, do not degenerate into a man,”\r\nhis friend would say to him.\r\n\r\nNever did the wolf bite: the man did now and then. At least, to bite was\r\nthe intent of Ursus. He was a misanthrope, and to italicize his\r\nmisanthropy he had made himself a juggler. To live, also; for the\r\nstomach has to be consulted. Moreover, this juggler-misanthrope, whether\r\nto add to the complexity of his being or to perfect it, was a doctor. To\r\nbe a doctor is little: Ursus was a ventriloquist. You heard him speak\r\nwithout his moving his lips. He counterfeited, so as to deceive you, any\r\none’s accent or pronunciation. He imitated voices so exactly that you\r\nbelieved you heard the people themselves. All alone he simulated the\r\nmurmur of a crowd, and this gave him a right to the title of\r\nEngastrimythos, which he took. He reproduced all sorts of cries of\r\nbirds, as of the thrush, the wren, the pipit lark, otherwise called the\r\ngray cheeper, and the ring ousel, all travellers like himself: so that\r\nat times when the fancy struck him, he made you aware either of a public\r\nthoroughfare filled with the uproar of men, or of a meadow loud with the\r\nvoices of beasts--at one time stormy as a multitude, at another fresh\r\nand serene as the dawn. Such gifts, although rare, exist. In the last\r\ncentury a man called Touzel, who imitated the mingled utterances of men\r\nand animals, and who counterfeited all the cries of beasts, was\r\nattached to the person of Buffon--to serve as a menagerie.\r\n\r\nUrsus was sagacious, contradictory, odd, and inclined to the singular\r\nexpositions which we term fables. He had the appearance of believing in\r\nthem, and this impudence was a part of his humour. He read people’s\r\nhands, opened books at random and drew conclusions, told fortunes,\r\ntaught that it is perilous to meet a black mare, still more perilous, as\r\nyou start for a journey, to hear yourself accosted by one who knows not\r\nwhither you are going; and he called himself a dealer in superstitions.\r\nHe used to say: “There is one difference between me and the Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury: I avow what I am.” Hence it was that the archbishop,\r\njustly indignant, had him one day before him; but Ursus cleverly\r\ndisarmed his grace by reciting a sermon he had composed upon Christmas\r\nDay, which the delighted archbishop learnt by heart, and delivered from\r\nthe pulpit as his own. In consideration thereof the archbishop pardoned\r\nUrsus.\r\n\r\nAs a doctor, Ursus wrought cures by some means or other. He made use of\r\naromatics; he was versed in simples; he made the most of the immense\r\npower which lies in a heap of neglected plants, such as the hazel, the\r\ncatkin, the white alder, the white bryony, the mealy-tree, the\r\ntraveller’s joy, the buckthorn. He treated phthisis with the sundew; at\r\nopportune moments he would use the leaves of the spurge, which plucked\r\nat the bottom are a purgative and plucked at the top, an emetic. He\r\ncured sore throat by means of the vegetable excrescence called Jew’s\r\near. He knew the rush which cures the ox and the mint which cures the\r\nhorse. He was well acquainted with the beauties and virtues of the herb\r\nmandragora, which, as every one knows, is of both sexes. He had many\r\nrecipes. He cured burns with the salamander wool, of which, according to\r\nPliny, Nero had a napkin. Ursus possessed a retort and a flask; he\r\neffected transmutations; he sold panaceas. It was said of him that he\r\nhad once been for a short time in Bedlam; they had done him the honour\r\nto take him for a madman, but had set him free on discovering that he\r\nwas only a poet. This story was probably not true; we have all to submit\r\nto some such legend about us.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, Ursus was a bit of a savant, a man of taste, and an old\r\nLatin poet. He was learned in two forms; he Hippocratized and he\r\nPindarized. He could have vied in bombast with Rapin and Vida. He could\r\nhave composed Jesuit tragedies in a style not less triumphant than that\r\nof Father Bouhours. It followed from his familiarity with the venerable\r\nrhythms and metres of the ancients, that he had peculiar figures of\r\nspeech, and a whole family of classical metaphors. He would say of a\r\nmother followed by her two daughters, _There is a dactyl_; of a father\r\npreceded by his two sons, _There is an anapæst_; and of a little child\r\nwalking between its grandmother and grandfather, _There is an\r\namphimacer_. So much knowledge could only end in starvation. The school\r\nof Salerno says, “Eat little and often.” Ursus ate little and seldom,\r\nthus obeying one half the precept and disobeying the other; but this was\r\nthe fault of the public, who did not always flock to him, and who did\r\nnot often buy.\r\n\r\nUrsus was wont to say: “The expectoration of a sentence is a relief. The\r\nwolf is comforted by its howl, the sheep by its wool, the forest by its\r\nfinch, woman by her love, and the philosopher by his epiphonema.” Ursus\r\nat a pinch composed comedies, which, in recital, he all but acted; this\r\nhelped to sell the drugs. Among other works, he had composed an heroic\r\npastoral in honour of Sir Hugh Middleton, who in 1608 brought a river to\r\nLondon. The river was lying peacefully in Hertfordshire, twenty miles\r\nfrom London: the knight came and took possession of it. He brought a\r\nbrigade of six hundred men, armed with shovels and pickaxes; set to\r\nbreaking up the ground, scooping it out in one place, raising it in\r\nanother--now thirty feet high, now twenty feet deep; made wooden\r\naqueducts high in air; and at different points constructed eight hundred\r\nbridges of stone, bricks, and timber. One fine morning the river entered\r\nLondon, which was short of water. Ursus transformed all these vulgar\r\ndetails into a fine Eclogue between the Thames and the New River, in\r\nwhich the former invited the latter to come to him, and offered her his\r\nbed, saying, “I am too old to please women, but I am rich enough to pay\r\nthem”--an ingenious and gallant conceit to indicate how Sir Hugh\r\nMiddleton had completed the work at his own expense.\r\n\r\nUrsus was great in soliloquy. Of a disposition at once unsociable and\r\ntalkative, desiring to see no one, yet wishing to converse with some\r\none, he got out of the difficulty by talking to himself. Any one who has\r\nlived a solitary life knows how deeply seated monologue is in one’s\r\nnature. Speech imprisoned frets to find a vent. To harangue space is an\r\noutlet. To speak out aloud when alone is as it were to have a dialogue\r\nwith the divinity which is within. It was, as is well known, a custom of\r\nSocrates; he declaimed to himself. Luther did the same. Ursus took after\r\nthose great men. He had the hermaphrodite faculty of being his own\r\naudience. He questioned himself, answered himself, praised himself,\r\nblamed himself. You heard him in the street soliloquizing in his van.\r\nThe passers-by, who have their own way of appreciating clever people,\r\nused to say: He is an idiot. As we have just observed, he abused himself\r\nat times; but there were times also when he rendered himself justice.\r\nOne day, in one of these allocutions addressed to himself, he was heard\r\nto cry out, “I have studied vegetation in all its mysteries--in the\r\nstalk, in the bud, in the sepal, in the stamen, in the carpel, in the\r\novule, in the spore, in the theca, and in the apothecium. I have\r\nthoroughly sifted chromatics, osmosy, and chymosy--that is to say, the\r\nformation of colours, of smell, and of taste.” There was something\r\nfatuous, doubtless, in this certificate which Ursus gave to Ursus; but\r\nlet those who have not thoroughly sifted chromatics, osmosy, and chymosy\r\ncast the first stone at him.\r\n\r\nFortunately Ursus had never gone into the Low Countries; there they\r\nwould certainly have weighed him, to ascertain whether he was of the\r\nnormal weight, above or below which a man is a sorcerer. In Holland this\r\nweight was sagely fixed by law. Nothing was simpler or more ingenious.\r\nIt was a clear test. They put you in a scale, and the evidence was\r\nconclusive if you broke the equilibrium. Too heavy, you were hanged; too\r\nlight, you were burned. To this day the scales in which sorcerers were\r\nweighed may be seen at Oudewater, but they are now used for weighing\r\ncheeses; how religion has degenerated! Ursus would certainly have had a\r\ncrow to pluck with those scales. In his travels he kept away from\r\nHolland, and he did well. Indeed, we believe that he used never to leave\r\nthe United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nHowever this may have been, he was very poor and morose, and having made\r\nthe acquaintance of Homo in a wood, a taste for a wandering life had\r\ncome over him. He had taken the wolf into partnership, and with him had\r\ngone forth on the highways, living in the open air the great life of\r\nchance. He had a great deal of industry and of reserve, and great skill\r\nin everything connected with healing operations, restoring the sick to\r\nhealth, and in working wonders peculiar to himself. He was considered a\r\nclever mountebank and a good doctor. As may be imagined, he passed for a\r\nwizard as well--not much indeed; only a little, for it was unwholesome\r\nin those days to be considered a friend of the devil. To tell the truth,\r\nUrsus, by his passion for pharmacy and his love of plants, laid himself\r\nopen to suspicion, seeing that he often went to gather herbs in rough\r\nthickets where grew Lucifer’s salads, and where, as has been proved by\r\nthe Counsellor De l’Ancre, there is a risk of meeting in the evening\r\nmist a man who comes out of the earth, “blind of the right eye,\r\nbarefooted, without a cloak, and a sword by his side.” But for the\r\nmatter of that, Ursus, although eccentric in manner and disposition, was\r\ntoo good a fellow to invoke or disperse hail, to make faces appear, to\r\nkill a man with the torment of excessive dancing, to suggest dreams fair\r\nor foul and full of terror, and to cause the birth of cocks with four\r\nwings. He had no such mischievous tricks. He was incapable of certain\r\nabominations, such as, for instance, speaking German, Hebrew, or Greek,\r\nwithout having learned them, which is a sign of unpardonable wickedness,\r\nor of a natural infirmity proceeding from a morbid humour. If Ursus\r\nspoke Latin, it was because he knew it. He would never have allowed\r\nhimself to speak Syriac, which he did not know. Besides, it is asserted\r\nthat Syriac is the language spoken in the midnight meetings at which\r\nuncanny people worship the devil. In medicine he justly preferred Galen\r\nto Cardan; Cardan, although a learned man, being but an earthworm to\r\nGalen.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, Ursus was not one of those persons who live in fear of the\r\npolice. His van was long enough and wide enough to allow of his lying\r\ndown in it on a box containing his not very sumptuous apparel. He owned\r\na lantern, several wigs, and some utensils suspended from nails, among\r\nwhich were musical instruments. He possessed, besides, a bearskin with\r\nwhich he covered himself on his days of grand performance. He called\r\nthis putting on full dress. He used to say, “I have two skins; this is\r\nthe real one,” pointing to the bearskin.\r\n\r\nThe little house on wheels belonged to himself and to the wolf. Besides\r\nhis house, his retort, and his wolf, he had a flute and a violoncello on\r\nwhich he played prettily. He concocted his own elixirs. His wits yielded\r\nhim enough to sup on sometimes. In the top of his van was a hole,\r\nthrough which passed the pipe of a cast-iron stove; so close to his box\r\nas to scorch the wood of it. The stove had two compartments; in one of\r\nthem Ursus cooked his chemicals, and in the other his potatoes. At night\r\nthe wolf slept under the van, amicably secured by a chain. Homo’s hair\r\nwas black, that of Ursus, gray; Ursus was fifty, unless, indeed, he was\r\nsixty. He accepted his destiny, to such an extent that, as we have just\r\nseen, he ate potatoes, the trash on which at that time they fed pigs and\r\nconvicts. He ate them indignant, but resigned. He was not tall--he was\r\nlong. He was bent and melancholy. The bowed frame of an old man is the\r\nsettlement in the architecture of life. Nature had formed him for\r\nsadness. He found it difficult to smile, and he had never been able to\r\nweep, so that he was deprived of the consolation of tears as well as of\r\nthe palliative of joy. An old man is a thinking ruin; and such a ruin\r\nwas Ursus. He had the loquacity of a charlatan, the leanness of a\r\nprophet, the irascibility of a charged mine: such was Ursus. In his\r\nyouth he had been a philosopher in the house of a lord.\r\n\r\nThis was 180 years ago, when men were more like wolves than they are\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nNot so very much though.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHomo was no ordinary wolf. From his appetite for medlars and potatoes he\r\nmight have been taken for a prairie wolf; from his dark hide, for a\r\nlycaon; and from his howl prolonged into a bark, for a dog of Chili. But\r\nno one has as yet observed the eyeball of a dog of Chili sufficiently to\r\nenable us to determine whether he be not a fox, and Homo was a real\r\nwolf. He was five feet long, which is a fine length for a wolf, even in\r\nLithuania; he was very strong; he looked at you askance, which was not\r\nhis fault; he had a soft tongue, with which he occasionally licked\r\nUrsus; he had a narrow brush of short bristles on his backbone, and he\r\nwas lean with the wholesome leanness of a forest life. Before he knew\r\nUrsus and had a carriage to draw, he thought nothing of doing his fifty\r\nmiles a night. Ursus meeting him in a thicket near a stream of running\r\nwater, had conceived a high opinion of him from seeing the skill and\r\nsagacity with which he fished out crayfish, and welcomed him as an\r\nhonest and genuine Koupara wolf of the kind called crab-eater.\r\n\r\nAs a beast of burden, Ursus preferred Homo to a donkey. He would have\r\nfelt repugnance to having his hut drawn by an ass; he thought too highly\r\nof the ass for that. Moreover he had observed that the ass, a\r\nfour-legged thinker little understood by men, has a habit of cocking his\r\nears uneasily when philosophers talk nonsense. In life the ass is a\r\nthird person between our thoughts and ourselves, and acts as a\r\nrestraint. As a friend, Ursus preferred Homo to a dog, considering that\r\nthe love of a wolf is more rare.\r\n\r\nHence it was that Homo sufficed for Ursus. Homo was for Ursus more than\r\na companion, he was an analogue. Ursus used to pat the wolf’s empty\r\nribs, saying: “I have found the second volume of myself!” Again he\r\nsaid, “When I am dead, any one wishing to know me need only study Homo.\r\nI shall leave a true copy behind me.”\r\n\r\nThe English law, not very lenient to beasts of the forest, might have\r\npicked a quarrel with the wolf, and have put him to trouble for his\r\nassurance in going freely about the towns: but Homo took advantage of\r\nthe immunity granted by a statute of Edward IV. to servants: “Every\r\nservant in attendance on his master is free to come and go.” Besides, a\r\ncertain relaxation of the law had resulted with regard to wolves, in\r\nconsequence of its being the fashion of the ladies of the Court, under\r\nthe later Stuarts, to have, instead of dogs, little wolves, called\r\nadives, about the size of cats, which were brought from Asia at great\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nUrsus had communicated to Homo a portion of his talents: such as to\r\nstand upright, to restrain his rage into sulkiness, to growl instead of\r\nhowling, etc.; and on his part, the wolf had taught the man what _he_\r\nknew--to do without a roof, without bread and fire, to prefer hunger in\r\nthe woods to slavery in a palace.\r\n\r\nThe van, hut, and vehicle in one, which traversed so many different\r\nroads, without, however, leaving Great Britain, had four wheels, with\r\nshafts for the wolf and a splinter-bar for the man. The splinter-bar\r\ncame into use when the roads were bad. The van was strong, although it\r\nwas built of light boards like a dove-cot. In front there was a glass\r\ndoor with a little balcony used for orations, which had something of the\r\ncharacter of the platform tempered by an air of the pulpit. At the back\r\nthere was a door with a practicable panel. By lowering the three steps\r\nwhich turned on a hinge below the door, access was gained to the hut,\r\nwhich at night was securely fastened with bolt and lock. Rain and snow\r\nhad fallen plentifully on it; it had been painted, but of what colour it\r\nwas difficult to say, change of season being to vans what changes of\r\nreign are to courtiers. In front, outside, was a board, a kind of\r\nfrontispiece, on which the following inscription might once have been\r\ndeciphered; it was in black letters on a white ground, but by degrees\r\nthe characters had become confused and blurred:--\r\n\r\n“By friction gold loses every year a fourteen hundredth part of its\r\nbulk. This is what is called the Wear. Hence it follows that on fourteen\r\nhundred millions of gold in circulation throughout the world, one\r\nmillion is lost annually. This million dissolves into dust, flies away,\r\nfloats about, is reduced to atoms, charges, drugs, weighs down\r\nconsciences, amalgamates with the souls of the rich whom it renders\r\nproud, and with those of the poor whom it renders brutish.”\r\n\r\nThe inscription, rubbed and blotted by the rain and by the kindness of\r\nnature, was fortunately illegible, for it is possible that its\r\nphilosophy concerning the inhalation of gold, at the same time both\r\nenigmatical and lucid, might not have been to the taste of the sheriffs,\r\nthe provost-marshals, and other big-wigs of the law. English legislation\r\ndid not trifle in those days. It did not take much to make a man a\r\nfelon. The magistrates were ferocious by tradition, and cruelty was a\r\nmatter of routine. The judges of assize increased and multiplied.\r\nJeffreys had become a breed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the van there were two other inscriptions. Above the\r\nbox, on a whitewashed plank, a hand had written in ink as follows:--\r\n\r\n    “THE ONLY THINGS NECESSARY TO KNOW.\r\n\r\n“The Baron, peer of England, wears a cap with six pearls. The coronet\r\nbegins with the rank of Viscount. The Viscount wears a coronet of which\r\nthe pearls are without number. The Earl a coronet with the pearls upon\r\npoints, mingled with strawberry leaves placed low between. The Marquis,\r\none with pearls and leaves on the same level. The Duke, one with\r\nstrawberry leaves alone--no pearls. The Royal Duke, a circlet of crosses\r\nand fleurs de lys. The Prince of Wales, crown like that of the King, but\r\nunclosed.\r\n\r\n“The Duke is a most high and most puissant prince, the Marquis and Earl\r\nmost noble and puissant lord, the Viscount noble and puissant lord, the\r\nBaron a trusty lord. The Duke is his Grace; the other Peers their\r\nLordships. _Most honourable_ is higher than _right honourable_.\r\n\r\n“Lords who are peers are lords in their own right. Lords who are not\r\npeers are lords by courtesy:--there are no real lords, excepting such as\r\nare peers.\r\n\r\n“The House of Lords is a chamber and a court, _Concilium et Curia_,\r\nlegislature and court of justice. The Commons, who are the people, when\r\nordered to the bar of the Lords, humbly present themselves bareheaded\r\nbefore the peers, who remain covered. The Commons send up their bills by\r\nforty members, who present the bill with three low bows. The Lords send\r\ntheir bills to the Commons by a mere clerk. In case of disagreement, the\r\ntwo Houses confer in the Painted Chamber, the Peers seated and covered,\r\nthe Commons standing and bareheaded.\r\n\r\n“Peers go to parliament in their coaches in file; the Commons do not.\r\nSome peers go to Westminster in open four-wheeled chariots. The use of\r\nthese and of coaches emblazoned with coats of arms and coronets is\r\nallowed only to peers, and forms a portion of their dignity.\r\n\r\n“Barons have the same rank as bishops. To be a baron peer of England, it\r\nis necessary to be in possession of a tenure from the king _per Baroniam\r\nintegram_, by full barony. The full barony consists of thirteen knights’\r\nfees and one third part, each knight’s fee being of the value of £20\r\nsterling, which makes in all 400 marks. The head of a barony (_Caput\r\nbaroniæ_) is a castle disposed by inheritance, as England herself, that\r\nis to say, descending to daughters if there be no sons, and in that case\r\ngoing to the eldest daughter, _cæteris filiabus aliundè satisfactis_.[1]\r\n\r\n“Barons have the degree of lord: in Saxon, _laford_; _dominus_ in high\r\nLatin; _Lordus_ in low Latin. The eldest and younger sons of viscounts\r\nand barons are the first esquires in the kingdom. The eldest sons of\r\npeers take precedence of knights of the garter. The younger sons do\r\nnot. The eldest son of a viscount comes after all barons, and precedes\r\nall baronets. Every daughter of a peer is a _Lady_. Other English girls\r\nare plain _Mistress_.\r\n\r\n“All judges rank below peers. The serjeant wears a lambskin tippet; the\r\njudge one of patchwork, _de minuto vario_, made up of a variety of\r\nlittle white furs, always excepting ermine. Ermine is reserved for peers\r\nand the king.\r\n\r\n“A lord never takes an oath, either to the crown or the law. His word\r\nsuffices; he says, Upon my honour.\r\n\r\n“By a law of Edward the Sixth, peers have the privilege of committing\r\nmanslaughter. A peer who kills a man without premeditation is not\r\nprosecuted.\r\n\r\n“The persons of peers are inviolable.\r\n\r\n“A peer cannot be held in durance, save in the Tower of London.\r\n\r\n“A writ of supplicavit cannot be granted against a peer.\r\n\r\n“A peer sent for by the king has the right to kill one or two deer in\r\nthe royal park.\r\n\r\n“A peer holds in his castle a baron’s court of justice.\r\n\r\n“It is unworthy of a peer to walk the street in a cloak, followed by two\r\nfootmen. He should only show himself attended by a great train of\r\ngentlemen of his household.\r\n\r\n“A peer can be amerced only by his peers, and never to any greater\r\namount than five pounds, excepting in the case of a duke, who can be\r\namerced ten.\r\n\r\n“A peer may retain six aliens born, any other Englishman but four.\r\n\r\n“A peer can have wine custom-free; an earl eight tuns.\r\n\r\n“A peer is alone exempt from presenting himself before the sheriff of\r\nthe circuit.\r\n\r\n“A peer cannot be assessed towards the militia.\r\n\r\n“When it pleases a peer he raises a regiment and gives it to the king;\r\nthus have done their graces the Dukes of Athol, Hamilton, and\r\nNorthumberland.\r\n\r\n“A peer can hold only of a peer.\r\n\r\n“In a civil cause he can demand the adjournment of the case, if there be\r\nnot at least one knight on the jury.\r\n\r\n“A peer nominates his own chaplains. A baron appoints three chaplains;\r\na viscount four; an earl and a marquis five; a duke six.\r\n\r\n“A peer cannot be put to the rack, even for high treason. A peer cannot\r\nbe branded on the hand. A peer is a clerk, though he knows not how to\r\nread. In law he knows.\r\n\r\n“A duke has a right to a canopy, or cloth of state, in all places where\r\nthe king is not present; a viscount may have one in his house; a baron\r\nhas a cover of assay, which may be held under his cup while he drinks. A\r\nbaroness has the right to have her train borne by a man in the presence\r\nof a viscountess.\r\n\r\n“Eighty-six tables, with five hundred dishes, are served every day in\r\nthe royal palace at each meal.\r\n\r\n“If a plebeian strike a lord, his hand is cut off.\r\n\r\n“A lord is very nearly a king.\r\n\r\n“The king is very nearly a god.\r\n\r\n“The earth is a lordship.\r\n\r\n“The English address God as my lord!”\r\n\r\nOpposite this writing was written a second one, in the same fashion,\r\nwhich ran thus:--\r\n\r\n“SATISFACTION WHICH MUST SUFFICE THOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING.\r\n\r\n“Henry Auverquerque, Earl of Grantham, who sits in the House of Lords\r\nbetween the Earl of Jersey and the Earl of Greenwich, has a hundred\r\nthousand a year. To his lordship belongs the palace of Grantham Terrace,\r\nbuilt all of marble and famous for what is called the labyrinth of\r\npassages--a curiosity which contains the scarlet corridor in marble of\r\nSarancolin, the brown corridor in lumachel of Astracan, the white\r\ncorridor in marble of Lani, the black corridor in marble of Alabanda,\r\nthe gray corridor in marble of Staremma, the yellow corridor in marble\r\nof Hesse, the green corridor in marble of the Tyrol, the red corridor,\r\nhalf cherry-spotted marble of Bohemia, half lumachel of Cordova, the\r\nblue corridor in turquin of Genoa, the violet in granite of Catalonia,\r\nthe mourning-hued corridor veined black and white in slate of Murviedro,\r\nthe pink corridor in cipolin of the Alps, the pearl corridor in lumachel\r\nof Nonetta, and the corridor of all colours, called the courtiers’\r\ncorridor, in motley.\r\n\r\n“Richard Lowther, Viscount Lonsdale, owns Lowther in Westmorland, which\r\nhas a magnificent approach, and a flight of entrance steps which seem to\r\ninvite the ingress of kings.\r\n\r\n“Richard, Earl of Scarborough, Viscount and Baron Lumley of Lumley\r\nCastle, Viscount Lumley of Waterford in Ireland, and Lord Lieutenant and\r\nVice-Admiral of the county of Northumberland and of Durham, both city\r\nand county, owns the double castleward of old and new Sandbeck, where\r\nyou admire a superb railing, in the form of a semicircle, surrounding\r\nthe basin of a matchless fountain. He has, besides, his castle of\r\nLumley.\r\n\r\n“Robert Darcy, Earl of Holderness, has his domain of Holderness, with\r\nbaronial towers, and large gardens laid out in French fashion, where he\r\ndrives in his coach-and-six, preceded by two outriders, as becomes a\r\npeer of England.\r\n\r\n“Charles Beauclerc, Duke of St. Albans, Earl of Burford, Baron\r\nHedington, Grand Falconer of England, has an abode at Windsor, regal\r\neven by the side of the king’s.\r\n\r\n“Charles Bodville Robartes, Baron Robartes of Truro, Viscount Bodmin and\r\nEarl of Radnor, owns Wimpole in Cambridgeshire, which is as three\r\npalaces in one, having three façades, one bowed and two triangular. The\r\napproach is by an avenue of trees four deep.\r\n\r\n“The most noble and most puissant Lord Philip, Baron Herbert of Cardiff,\r\nEarl of Montgomery and of Pembroke, Ross of Kendall, Parr, Fitzhugh,\r\nMarmion, St. Quentin, and Herbert of Shurland, Warden of the Stannaries\r\nin the counties of Cornwall and Devon, hereditary visitor of Jesus\r\nCollege, possesses the wonderful gardens at Wilton, where there are two\r\nsheaf-like fountains, finer than those of his most Christian Majesty\r\nKing Louis XIV. at Versailles.\r\n\r\n“Charles Somerset, Duke of Somerset, owns Somerset House on the Thames,\r\nwhich is equal to the Villa Pamphili at Rome. On the chimney-piece are\r\nseen two porcelain vases of the dynasty of the Yuens, which are worth\r\nhalf a million in French money.\r\n\r\n“In Yorkshire, Arthur, Lord Ingram, Viscount Irwin, has Temple Newsain,\r\nwhich is entered under a triumphal arch and which has large wide roofs\r\nresembling Moorish terraces.\r\n\r\n“Robert, Lord Ferrers of Chartly, Bourchier, and Lonvaine, has Staunton\r\nHarold in Leicestershire, of which the park is geometrically planned in\r\nthe shape of a temple with a façade, and in front of the piece of water\r\nis the great church with the square belfry, which belongs to his\r\nlordship.\r\n\r\n“In the county of Northampton, Charles Spencer, Earl of Sunderland,\r\nmember of his Majesty’s Privy Council, possesses Althorp, at the\r\nentrance of which is a railing with four columns surmounted by groups in\r\nmarble.\r\n\r\n“Laurence Hyde, Earl of Rochester, has, in Surrey, New Park, rendered\r\nmagnificent by its sculptured pinnacles, its circular lawn belted by\r\ntrees, and its woodland, at the extremity of which is a little mountain,\r\nartistically rounded, and surmounted by a large oak, which can be seen\r\nfrom afar.\r\n\r\n“Philip Stanhope, Earl of Chesterfield, possesses Bretby Hall in\r\nDerbyshire, with a splendid clock tower, falconries, warrens, and very\r\nfine sheets of water, long, square, and oval, one of which is shaped\r\nlike a mirror, and has two jets, which throw the water to a great\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n“Charles Cornwallis, Baron Cornwallis of Eye, owns Broome Hall, a palace\r\nof the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n“The most noble Algernon Capel, Viscount Maiden, Earl of Essex, has\r\nCashiobury in Hertfordshire, a seat which has the shape of a capital H,\r\nand which rejoices sportsmen with its abundance of game.\r\n\r\n“Charles, Lord Ossulston, owns Darnley in Middlesex, approached by\r\nItalian gardens.\r\n\r\n“James Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, has, seven leagues from London,\r\nHatfield House, with its four lordly pavilions, its belfry in the\r\ncentre, and its grand courtyard of black and white slabs, like that of\r\nSt. Germain. This palace, which has a frontage 272 feet in length, was\r\nbuilt in the reign of James I. by the Lord High Treasurer of England,\r\nthe great-grandfather of the present earl. To be seen there is the bed\r\nof one of the Countesses of Salisbury: it is of inestimable value and\r\nmade entirely of Brazilian wood, which is a panacea against the bites of\r\nserpents, and which is called _milhombres_--that is to say, a thousand\r\nmen. On this bed is inscribed, _Honi soit qui mal y pense_.\r\n\r\n“Edward Rich, Earl of Warwick and Holland, is owner of Warwick Castle,\r\nwhere whole oaks are burnt in the fireplaces.\r\n\r\n“In the parish of Sevenoaks, Charles Sackville, Baron Buckhurst, Baron\r\nCranfield, Earl of Dorset and Middlesex, is owner of Knowle, which is as\r\nlarge as a town and is composed of three palaces standing parallel one\r\nbehind the other, like ranks of infantry. There are six covered flights\r\nof steps on the principal frontage, and a gate under a keep with four\r\ntowers.\r\n\r\n“Thomas Thynne, Baron Thynne of Warminster, and Viscount Weymouth,\r\npossesses Longleat, in which there are as many chimneys, cupolas,\r\npinnacles, pepper-boxes pavilions, and turrets as at Chambord, in\r\nFrance, which belongs to the king.\r\n\r\n“Henry Howard, Earl of Suffolk, owns, twelve leagues from London, the\r\npalace of Audley End in Essex, which in grandeur and dignity scarcely\r\nyields the palm to the Escorial of the King of Spain.\r\n\r\n“In Bedfordshire, Wrest House and Park, which is a whole district,\r\nenclosed by ditches, walls, woodlands, rivers, and hills, belongs to\r\nHenry, Marquis of Kent.\r\n\r\n“Hampton Court, in Herefordshire, with its strong embattled keep, and\r\nits gardens bounded by a piece of water which divides them from the\r\nforest, belongs to Thomas, Lord Coningsby.\r\n\r\n“Grimsthorp, in Lincolnshire, with its long façade intersected by\r\nturrets in pale, its park, its fish-ponds, its pheasantries, its\r\nsheepfolds, its lawns, its grounds planted with rows of trees, its\r\ngroves, its walks, its shrubberies, its flower-beds and borders, formed\r\nin square and lozenge-shape, and resembling great carpets; its\r\nracecourses, and the majestic sweep for carriages to turn in at the\r\nentrance of the house--belongs to Robert, Earl Lindsey, hereditary lord\r\nof the forest of Waltham.\r\n\r\n“Up Park, in Sussex, a square house, with two symmetrical belfried\r\npavilions on each side of the great courtyard, belongs to the Right\r\nHonourable Forde, Baron Grey of Werke, Viscount Glendale and Earl of\r\nTankerville.\r\n\r\n“Newnham Paddox, in Warwickshire, which has two quadrangular fish-ponds\r\nand a gabled archway with a large window of four panes, belongs to the\r\nEarl of Denbigh, who is also Count von Rheinfelden, in Germany.\r\n\r\n“Wytham Abbey, in Berkshire, with its French garden in which there are\r\nfour curiously trimmed arbours, and its great embattled towers,\r\nsupported by two bastions, belongs to Montague, Earl of Abingdon, who\r\nalso owns Rycote, of which he is Baron, and the principal door of which\r\nbears the device _Virtus ariete fortior_.\r\n\r\n“William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire, has six dwelling-places, of\r\nwhich Chatsworth (two storied, and of the finest order of Grecian\r\narchitecture) is one.\r\n\r\n“The Viscount of Kinalmeaky, who is Earl of Cork, in Ireland, is owner\r\nof Burlington House, Piccadilly, with its extensive gardens, reaching to\r\nthe fields outside London; he is also owner of Chiswick, where there are\r\nnine magnificent lodges; he also owns Londesborough, which is a new\r\nhouse by the side of an old palace.\r\n\r\n“The Duke of Beaufort owns Chelsea, which contains two Gothic buildings,\r\nand a Florentine one; he has also Badminton, in Gloucestershire, a\r\nresidence from which a number of avenues branch out like rays from a\r\nstar. The most noble and puissant Prince Henry, Duke of Beaufort, is\r\nalso Marquis and Earl of Worcester, Earl of Glamorgan, Viscount\r\nGrosmont, and Baron Herbert of Chepstow, Ragland, and Gower, Baron\r\nBeaufort of Caldecott Castle, and Baron de Bottetourt.\r\n\r\n“John Holies, Duke of Newcastle, and Marquis of Clare, owns Bolsover,\r\nwith its majestic square keeps; his also is Haughton, in\r\nNottinghamshire, where a round pyramid, made to imitate the Tower of\r\nBabel, stands in the centre of a basin of water.\r\n\r\n“William, Earl of Craven, Viscount Uffington, and Baron Craven of\r\nHamstead Marshall, owns Combe Abbey in Warwickshire, where is to be seen\r\nthe finest water-jet in England; and in Berkshire two baronies, Hamstead\r\nMarshall, on the façade of which are five Gothic lanterns sunk in the\r\nwall, and Ashdown Park, which is a country seat situate at the point of\r\nintersection of cross-roads in a forest.\r\n\r\n“Linnæus, Lord Clancharlie, Baron Clancharlie and Hunkerville, Marquis\r\nof Corleone in Sicily, derives his title from the castle of Clancharlie,\r\nbuilt in 912 by Edward the Elder, as a defence against the Danes.\r\nBesides Hunkerville House, in London, which is a palace, he has Corleone\r\nLodge at Windsor, which is another, and eight castlewards, one at\r\nBurton-on-Trent, with a royalty on the carriage of plaster of Paris;\r\nthen Grumdaith Humble, Moricambe, Trewardraith, Hell-Kerters (where\r\nthere is a miraculous well), Phillinmore, with its turf bogs, Reculver,\r\nnear the ancient city Vagniac, Vinecaunton, on the Moel-eulle Mountain;\r\nbesides nineteen boroughs and villages with reeves, and the whole of\r\nPenneth chase, all of which bring his lordship £40,000 a year.\r\n\r\n“The 172 peers enjoying their dignities under James II. possess among\r\nthem altogether a revenue of £1,272,000 sterling a year, which is the\r\neleventh part of the revenue of England.”\r\n\r\nIn the margin, opposite the last name (that of Linnæus, Lord\r\nClancharlie), there was a note in the handwriting of Ursus: _Rebel; in\r\nexile; houses, lands, and chattels sequestrated. It is well_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nUrsus admired Homo. One admires one’s like. It is a law. To be always\r\nraging inwardly and grumbling outwardly was the normal condition of\r\nUrsus. He was the malcontent of creation. By nature he was a man ever in\r\nopposition. He took the world unkindly; he gave his satisfecit to no one\r\nand to nothing. The bee did not atone, by its honey-making, for its\r\nsting; a full-blown rose did not absolve the sun for yellow fever and\r\nblack vomit. It is probable that in secret Ursus criticized Providence a\r\ngood deal. “Evidently,” he would say, “the devil works by a spring, and\r\nthe wrong that God does is having let go the trigger.” He approved of\r\nnone but princes, and he had his own peculiar way of expressing his\r\napprobation. One day, when James II. made a gift to the Virgin in a\r\nCatholic chapel in Ireland of a massive gold lamp, Ursus, passing that\r\nway with Homo, who was more indifferent to such things, broke out in\r\nadmiration before the crowd, and exclaimed, “It is certain that the\r\nblessed Virgin wants a lamp much more than these barefooted children\r\nthere require shoes.”\r\n\r\nSuch proofs of his loyalty, and such evidences of his respect for\r\nestablished powers, probably contributed in no small degree to make the\r\nmagistrates tolerate his vagabond life and his low alliance with a wolf.\r\nSometimes of an evening, through the weakness of friendship, he allowed\r\nHomo to stretch his limbs and wander at liberty about the caravan. The\r\nwolf was incapable of an abuse of confidence, and behaved in society,\r\nthat is to say among men, with the discretion of a poodle. All the same,\r\nif bad-tempered officials had to be dealt with, difficulties might have\r\narisen; so Ursus kept the honest wolf chained up as much as possible.\r\n\r\nFrom a political point of view, his writing about gold, not very\r\nintelligible in itself, and now become undecipherable, was but a smear,\r\nand gave no handle to the enemy. Even after the time of James II., and\r\nunder the “respectable” reign of William and Mary, his caravan might\r\nhave been seen peacefully going its rounds of the little English country\r\ntowns. He travelled freely from one end of Great Britain to the other,\r\nselling his philtres and phials, and sustaining, with the assistance of\r\nhis wolf, his quack mummeries; and he passed with ease through the\r\nmeshes of the nets which the police at that period had spread all over\r\nEngland in order to sift wandering gangs, and especially to stop the\r\nprogress of the Comprachicos.\r\n\r\nThis was right enough. Ursus belonged to no gang. Ursus lived with\r\nUrsus, a _tête-à-tête_, into which the wolf gently thrust his nose. If\r\nUrsus could have had his way, he would have been a Caribbee; that being\r\nimpossible, he preferred to be alone. The solitary man is a modified\r\nsavage, accepted by civilization. He who wanders most is most alone;\r\nhence his continual change of place. To remain anywhere long suffocated\r\nhim with the sense of being tamed. He passed his life in passing on his\r\nway. The sight of towns increased his taste for brambles, thickets,\r\nthorns, and holes in the rock. His home was the forest. He did not feel\r\nhimself much out of his element in the murmur of crowded streets, which\r\nis like enough to the bluster of trees. The crowd to some extent\r\nsatisfies our taste for the desert. What he disliked in his van was its\r\nhaving a door and windows, and thus resembling a house. He would have\r\nrealized his ideal, had he been able to put a cave on four wheels and\r\ntravel in a den.\r\n\r\nHe did not smile, as we have already said, but he used to laugh;\r\nsometimes, indeed frequently, a bitter laugh. There is consent in a\r\nsmile, while a laugh is often a refusal.\r\n\r\nHis great business was to hate the human race. He was implacable in that\r\nhate. Having made it clear that human life is a dreadful thing; having\r\nobserved the superposition of evils, kings on the people, war on kings,\r\nthe plague on war, famine on the plague, folly on everything; having\r\nproved a certain measure of chastisement in the mere fact of existence;\r\nhaving recognized that, death is a deliverance--when they brought him a\r\nsick man he cured him; he had cordials and beverages to prolong the\r\nlives of the old. He put lame cripples on their legs again, and hurled\r\nthis sarcasm at them, “There, you are on your paws once more; may you\r\nwalk long in this valley of tears!” When he saw a poor man dying of\r\nhunger, he gave him all the pence he had about him, growling out, “Live\r\non, you wretch! eat! last a long time! It is not I who would shorten\r\nyour penal servitude.” After which, he would rub his hands and say, “I\r\ndo men all the harm I can.”\r\n\r\nThrough the little window at the back, passers-by could read on the\r\nceiling of the van these words, written within, but visible from\r\nwithout, inscribed with charcoal, in big letters,--\r\n\r\n                     URSUS, PHILOSOPHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER PRELIMINARY CHAPTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMPRACHICOS.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho now knows the word Comprachicos, and who knows its meaning?\r\n\r\nThe Comprachicos, or Comprapequeños, were a hideous and nondescript\r\nassociation of wanderers, famous in the 17th century, forgotten in the\r\n18th, unheard of in the 19th. The Comprachicos are like the “succession\r\npowder,” an ancient social characteristic detail. They are part of old\r\nhuman ugliness. To the great eye of history, which sees everything\r\ncollectively, the Comprachicos belong to the colossal fact of slavery.\r\nJoseph sold by his brethren is a chapter in their story. The\r\nComprachicos have left their traces in the penal laws of Spain and\r\nEngland. You find here and there in the dark confusion of English laws\r\nthe impress of this horrible truth, like the foot-print of a savage in a\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nComprachicos, the same as Comprapequeños, is a compound Spanish word\r\nsignifying Child-buyers.\r\n\r\nThe Comprachicos traded in children. They bought and sold them. They did\r\nnot steal them. The kidnapping of children is another branch of\r\nindustry. And what did they make of these children?\r\n\r\nMonsters.\r\n\r\nWhy monsters?\r\n\r\nTo laugh at.\r\n\r\nThe populace must needs laugh, and kings too. The mountebank is wanted\r\nin the streets, the jester at the Louvre. The one is called a Clown, the\r\nother a Fool.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of man to procure himself pleasure are at times worthy of\r\nthe attention of the philosopher.\r\n\r\nWhat are we sketching in these few preliminary pages? A chapter in the\r\nmost terrible of books; a book which might be entitled--_The farming of\r\nthe unhappy by the happy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nA child destined to be a plaything for men--such a thing has existed;\r\nsuch a thing exists even now. In simple and savage times such a thing\r\nconstituted an especial trade. The 17th century, called the great\r\ncentury, was of those times. It was a century very Byzantine in tone. It\r\ncombined corrupt simplicity with delicate ferocity--a curious variety of\r\ncivilization. A tiger with a simper. Madame de Sevigné minces on the\r\nsubject of the fagot and the wheel. That century traded a good deal in\r\nchildren. Flattering historians have concealed the sore, but have\r\ndivulged the remedy, Vincent de Paul.\r\n\r\nIn order that a human toy should succeed, he must be taken early. The\r\ndwarf must be fashioned when young. We play with childhood. But a\r\nwell-formed child is not very amusing; a hunchback is better fun.\r\n\r\nHence grew an art. There were trainers who took a man and made him an\r\nabortion; they took a face and made a muzzle; they stunted growth; they\r\nkneaded the features. The artificial production of teratological cases\r\nhad its rules. It was quite a science--what one can imagine as the\r\nantithesis of orthopedy. Where God had put a look, their art put a\r\nsquint; where God had made harmony, they made discord; where God had\r\nmade the perfect picture, they re-established the sketch; and, in the\r\neyes of connoisseurs, it was the sketch which was perfect. They debased\r\nanimals as well; they invented piebald horses. Turenne rode a piebald\r\nhorse. In our own days do they not dye dogs blue and green? Nature is\r\nour canvas. Man has always wished to add something to God’s work. Man\r\nretouches creation, sometimes for better, sometimes for worse. The Court\r\nbuffoon was nothing but an attempt to lead back man to the monkey. It\r\nwas a progress the wrong way. A masterpiece in retrogression. At the\r\nsame time they tried to make a man of the monkey. Barbara, Duchess of\r\nCleveland and Countess of Southampton, had a marmoset for a page.\r\nFrances Sutton, Baroness Dudley, eighth peeress in the bench of barons,\r\nhad tea served by a baboon clad in cold brocade, which her ladyship\r\ncalled My Black. Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester, used to go\r\nand take her seat in Parliament in a coach with armorial bearings,\r\nbehind which stood, their muzzles stuck up in the air, three Cape\r\nmonkeys in grand livery. A Duchess of Medina-Celi, whose toilet Cardinal\r\nPole witnessed, had her stockings put on by an orang-outang. These\r\nmonkeys raised in the scale were a counterpoise to men brutalized and\r\nbestialized. This promiscuousness of man and beast, desired by the\r\ngreat, was especially prominent in the case of the dwarf and the dog.\r\nThe dwarf never quitted the dog, which was always bigger than himself.\r\nThe dog was the pair of the dwarf; it was as if they were coupled with a\r\ncollar. This juxtaposition is authenticated by a mass of domestic\r\nrecords--notably by the portrait of Jeffrey Hudson, dwarf of Henrietta\r\nof France, daughter of Henri IV., and wife of Charles I.\r\n\r\nTo degrade man tends to deform him. The suppression of his state was\r\ncompleted by disfigurement. Certain vivisectors of that period succeeded\r\nmarvellously well in effacing from the human face the divine effigy.\r\nDoctor Conquest, member of the Amen Street College, and judicial visitor\r\nof the chemists’ shops of London, wrote a book in Latin on this\r\npseudo-surgery, the processes of which he describes. If we are to\r\nbelieve Justus of Carrickfergus, the inventor of this branch of surgery\r\nwas a monk named Avonmore--an Irish word signifying Great River.\r\n\r\nThe dwarf of the Elector Palatine, Perkeo, whose effigy--or\r\nghost--springs from a magical box in the cave of Heidelberg, was a\r\nremarkable specimen of this science, very varied in its applications. It\r\nfashioned beings the law of whose existence was hideously simple: it\r\npermitted them to suffer, and commanded them to amuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of monsters was practised on a large scale, and\r\ncomprised various branches.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan required them, so did the Pope; the one to guard his women,\r\nthe other to say his prayers. These were of a peculiar kind, incapable\r\nof reproduction. Scarcely human beings, they were useful to\r\nvoluptuousness and to religion. The seraglio and the Sistine Chapel\r\nutilized the same species of monsters; fierce in the former case, mild\r\nin the latter.\r\n\r\nThey knew how to produce things in those days which are not produced\r\nnow; they had talents which we lack, and it is not without reason that\r\nsome good folk cry out that the decline has come. We no longer know how\r\nto sculpture living human flesh; this is consequent on the loss of the\r\nart of torture. Men were once virtuosi in that respect, but are so no\r\nlonger; the art has become so simplified that it will soon disappear\r\naltogether. In cutting the limbs of living men, in opening their bellies\r\nand in dragging out their entrails, phenomena were grasped on the moment\r\nand discoveries made. We are obliged to renounce these experiments now,\r\nand are thus deprived of the progress which surgery made by aid of the\r\nexecutioner.\r\n\r\nThe vivisection of former days was not limited to the manufacture of\r\nphenomena for the market-place, of buffoons for the palace (a species of\r\naugmentative of the courtier), and eunuchs for sultans and popes. It\r\nabounded in varieties. One of its triumphs was the manufacture of cocks\r\nfor the king of England.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom, in the palace of the kings of England, to have a sort\r\nof watchman, who crowed like a cock. This watcher, awake while all\r\nothers slept, ranged the palace, and raised from hour to hour the cry of\r\nthe farmyard, repeating it as often as was necessary, and thus supplying\r\na clock. This man, promoted to be cock, had in childhood undergone the\r\noperation of the pharynx, which was part of the art described by Dr.\r\nConquest. Under Charles II. the salivation inseparable to the operation\r\nhaving disgusted the Duchess of Portsmouth, the appointment was indeed\r\npreserved, so that the splendour of the crown should not be tarnished,\r\nbut they got an unmutilated man to represent the cock. A retired officer\r\nwas generally selected for this honourable employment. Under James II.\r\nthe functionary was named William Sampson, Cock, and received for his\r\ncrow £9, 2s. 6d. annually.\r\n\r\nThe memoirs of Catherine II. inform us that at St. Petersburg, scarcely\r\na hundred years since, whenever the czar or czarina was displeased with\r\na Russian prince, he was forced to squat down in the great antechamber\r\nof the palace, and to remain in that posture a certain number of days,\r\nmewing like a cat, or clucking like a sitting hen, and pecking his food\r\nfrom the floor.\r\n\r\nThese fashions have passed away; but not so much, perhaps, as one might\r\nimagine. Nowadays, courtiers slightly modify their intonation in\r\nclucking to please their masters. More than one picks up from the\r\nground--we will not say from the mud--what he eats.\r\n\r\nIt is very fortunate that kings cannot err. Hence their contradictions\r\nnever perplex us. In approving always, one is sure to be always\r\nright--which is pleasant. Louis XIV. would not have liked to see at\r\nVersailles either an officer acting the cock, or a prince acting the\r\nturkey. That which raised the royal and imperial dignity in England and\r\nRussia would have seemed to Louis the Great incompatible with the crown\r\nof St. Louis. We know what his displeasure was when Madame Henriette\r\nforgot herself so far as to see a hen in a dream--which was, indeed, a\r\ngrave breach of good manners in a lady of the court. When one is of the\r\ncourt, one should not dream of the courtyard. Bossuet, it may be\r\nremembered, was nearly as scandalized as Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commerce in children in the 17th century, as we have explained, was\r\nconnected with a trade. The Comprachicos engaged in the commerce, and\r\ncarried on the trade. They bought children, worked a little on the raw\r\nmaterial, and resold them afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe venders were of all kinds: from the wretched father, getting rid of\r\nhis family, to the master, utilizing his stud of slaves. The sale of men\r\nwas a simple matter. In our own time we have had fighting to maintain\r\nthis right. Remember that it is less than a century ago since the\r\nElector of Hesse sold his subjects to the King of England, who required\r\nmen to be killed in America. Kings went to the Elector of Hesse as we go\r\nto the butcher to buy meat. The Elector had food for powder in stock,\r\nand hung up his subjects in his shop. Come buy; it is for sale. In\r\nEngland, under Jeffreys, after the tragical episode of Monmouth, there\r\nwere many lords and gentlemen beheaded and quartered. Those who were\r\nexecuted left wives and daughters, widows and orphans, whom James II.\r\ngave to the queen, his wife. The queen sold these ladies to William\r\nPenn. Very likely the king had so much per cent. on the transaction. The\r\nextraordinary thing is, not that James II. should have sold the women,\r\nbut that William Penn should have bought them. Penn’s purchase is\r\nexcused, or explained, by the fact that having a desert to sow with men,\r\nhe needed women as farming implements.\r\n\r\nHer Gracious Majesty made a good business out of these ladies. The young\r\nsold dear. We may imagine, with the uneasy feeling which a complicated\r\nscandal arouses, that probably some old duchesses were thrown in cheap.\r\n\r\nThe Comprachicos were also called the Cheylas, a Hindu word, which\r\nconveys the image of harrying a nest.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the Comprachicos only partially concealed themselves.\r\nThere is sometimes in the social order a favouring shadow thrown over\r\niniquitous trades, in which they thrive. In our own day we have seen an\r\nassociation of the kind in Spain, under the direction of the ruffian\r\nRamon Selles, last from 1834 to 1866, and hold three provinces under\r\nterror for thirty years--Valencia, Alicante, and Murcia.\r\n\r\nUnder the Stuarts, the Comprachicos were by no means in bad odour at\r\ncourt. On occasions they were used for reasons of state. For James II.\r\nthey were almost an _instrumentum regni_. It was a time when families,\r\nwhich were refractory or in the way, were dismembered; when a descent\r\nwas cut short; when heirs were suddenly suppressed. At times one branch\r\nwas defrauded to the profit of another. The Comprachicos had a genius\r\nfor disfiguration which recommended them to state policy. To disfigure\r\nis better than to kill. There was, indeed, the Iron Mask, but that was a\r\nmighty measure. Europe could not be peopled with iron masks, while\r\ndeformed tumblers ran about the streets without creating any surprise.\r\nBesides, the iron mask is removable; not so the mask of flesh. You are\r\nmasked for ever by your own flesh--what can be more ingenious? The\r\nComprachicos worked on man as the Chinese work on trees. They had their\r\nsecrets, as we have said; they had tricks which are now lost arts. A\r\nsort of fantastic stunted thing left their hands; it was ridiculous and\r\nwonderful. They would touch up a little being with such skill that its\r\nfather could not have known it. _Et que méconnaîtrait l’oeil même de son\r\npère_, as Racine says in bad French. Sometimes they left the spine\r\nstraight and remade the face. They unmarked a child as one might unmark\r\na pocket-handkerchief. Products, destined for tumblers, had their joints\r\ndislocated in a masterly manner--you would have said they had been\r\nboned. Thus gymnasts were made.\r\n\r\nNot only did the Comprachicos take away his face from the child, they\r\nalso took away his memory. At least they took away all they could of it;\r\nthe child had no consciousness of the mutilation to which he had been\r\nsubjected. This frightful surgery left its traces on his countenance,\r\nbut not on his mind. The most he could recall was that one day he had\r\nbeen seized by men, that next he had fallen asleep, and then that he had\r\nbeen cured. Cured of what? He did not know. Of burnings by sulphur and\r\nincisions by the iron he remembered nothing. The Comprachicos deadened\r\nthe little patient by means of a stupefying powder which was thought to\r\nbe magical, and suppressed all pain. This powder has been known from\r\ntime immemorial in China, and is still employed there in the present\r\nday. The Chinese have been beforehand with us in all our\r\ninventions--printing, artillery, aerostation, chloroform. Only the\r\ndiscovery which in Europe at once takes life and birth, and becomes a\r\nprodigy and a wonder, remains a chrysalis in China, and is preserved in\r\na deathlike state. China is a museum of embryos.\r\n\r\nSince we are in China, let us remain there a moment to note a\r\npeculiarity. In China, from time immemorial, they have possessed a\r\ncertain refinement of industry and art. It is the art of moulding a\r\nliving man. They take a child, two or three years old, put him in a\r\nporcelain vase, more or less grotesque, which is made without top or\r\nbottom, to allow egress for the head and feet. During the day the vase\r\nis set upright, and at night is laid down to allow the child to sleep.\r\nThus the child thickens without growing taller, filling up with his\r\ncompressed flesh and distorted bones the reliefs in the vase. This\r\ndevelopment in a bottle continues many years. After a certain time it\r\nbecomes irreparable. When they consider that this is accomplished, and\r\nthe monster made, they break the vase. The child comes out--and, behold,\r\nthere is a man in the shape of a mug!\r\n\r\nThis is convenient: by ordering your dwarf betimes you are able to have\r\nit of any shape you wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames II. tolerated the Comprachicos for the good reason that he made\r\nuse of them; at least it happened that he did so more than once. We do\r\nnot always disdain to use what we despise. This low trade, an excellent\r\nexpedient sometimes for the higher one which is called state policy, was\r\nwillingly left in a miserable state, but was not persecuted. There was\r\nno surveillance, but a certain amount of attention. Thus much might be\r\nuseful--the law closed one eye, the king opened the other.\r\n\r\nSometimes the king went so far as to avow his complicity. These are\r\naudacities of monarchical terrorism. The disfigured one was marked with\r\nthe fleur-de-lis; they took from him the mark of God; they put on him\r\nthe mark of the king. Jacob Astley, knight and baronet, lord of Melton\r\nConstable, in the county of Norfolk, had in his family a child who had\r\nbeen sold, and upon whose forehead the dealer had imprinted a\r\nfleur-de-lis with a hot iron. In certain cases in which it was held\r\ndesirable to register for some reason the royal origin of the new\r\nposition made for the child, they used such means. England has always\r\ndone us the honour to utilize, for her personal service, the\r\nfleur-de-lis.\r\n\r\nThe Comprachicos, allowing for the shade which divides a trade from a\r\nfanaticism, were analogous to the Stranglers of India. They lived among\r\nthemselves in gangs, and to facilitate their progress, affected somewhat\r\nof the merry-andrew. They encamped here and there, but they were grave\r\nand religious, bearing no affinity to other nomads, and incapable of\r\ntheft. The people for a long time wrongly confounded them with the Moors\r\nof Spain and the Moors of China. The Moors of Spain were coiners, the\r\nMoors of China were thieves. There was nothing of the sort about the\r\nComprachicos; they were honest folk. Whatever you may think of them,\r\nthey were sometimes sincerely scrupulous. They pushed open a door,\r\nentered, bargained for a child, paid, and departed. All was done with\r\npropriety.\r\n\r\nThey were of all countries. Under the name of Comprachicos fraternized\r\nEnglish, French, Castilians, Germans, Italians. A unity of idea, a unity\r\nof superstition, the pursuit of the same calling, make such fusions. In\r\nthis fraternity of vagabonds, those of the Mediterranean seaboard\r\nrepresented the East, those of the Atlantic seaboard the West. Many\r\nBasques conversed with many Irishmen. The Basque and the Irishman\r\nunderstand each other--they speak the old Punic jargon; add to this the\r\nintimate relations of Catholic Ireland with Catholic Spain--relations\r\nsuch that they terminated by bringing to the gallows in London one\r\nalmost King of Ireland, the Celtic Lord de Brany; from which resulted\r\nthe conquest of the county of Leitrim.\r\n\r\nThe Comprachicos were rather a fellowship than a tribe; rather a\r\nresiduum than a fellowship. It was all the riffraff of the universe,\r\nhaving for their trade a crime. It was a sort of harlequin people, all\r\ncomposed of rags. To recruit a man was to sew on a tatter.\r\n\r\nTo wander was the Comprachicos’ law of existence--to appear and\r\ndisappear. What is barely tolerated cannot take root. Even in the\r\nkingdoms where their business supplied the courts, and, on occasions,\r\nserved as an auxiliary to the royal power, they were now and then\r\nsuddenly ill-treated. Kings made use of their art, and sent the artists\r\nto the galleys. These inconsistencies belong to the ebb and flow of\r\nroyal caprice. “For such is our pleasure.”\r\n\r\nA rolling stone and a roving trade gather no moss. The Comprachicos were\r\npoor. They might have said what the lean and ragged witch observed, when\r\nshe saw them setting fire to the stake, “Le jeu n’en vaut pas la\r\nchandelle.” It is possible, nay probable (their chiefs remaining\r\nunknown), that the wholesale contractors in the trade were rich. After\r\nthe lapse of two centuries, it would be difficult to throw any light on\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\nIt was, as we have said, a fellowship. It had its laws, its oaths, its\r\nformulæ--it had almost its cabala. Any one nowadays wishing to know all\r\nabout the Comprachicos need only go into Biscaya or Galicia; there were\r\nmany Basques among them, and it is in those mountains that one hears\r\ntheir history. To this day the Comprachicos are spoken of at Oyarzun, at\r\nUrbistondo, at Leso, at Astigarraga. _Aguardate niño, que voy a llamar\r\nal Comprachicos_--Take care, child, or I’ll call the Comprachicos--is\r\nthe cry with which mothers frighten their children in that country.\r\n\r\nThe Comprachicos, like the Zigeuner and the Gipsies, had appointed\r\nplaces for periodical meetings. From time to time their leaders\r\nconferred together. In the seventeenth century they had four principal\r\npoints of rendezvous: one in Spain--the pass of Pancorbo; one in\r\nGermany--the glade called the Wicked Woman, near Diekirsch, where there\r\nare two enigmatic bas-reliefs, representing a woman with a head and a\r\nman without one; one in France--the hill where was the colossal statue\r\nof Massue-la-Promesse in the old sacred wood of Borvo Tomona, near\r\nBourbonne les Bains; one in England--behind the garden wall of William\r\nChalloner, Squire of Gisborough in Cleveland, Yorkshire, behind the\r\nsquare tower and the great wing which is entered by an arched door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe laws against vagabonds have always been very rigorous in England.\r\nEngland, in her Gothic legislation, seemed to be inspired with this\r\nprinciple, _Homo errans fera errante pejor_. One of the special statutes\r\nclassifies the man without a home as “more dangerous than the asp,\r\ndragon, lynx, or basilisk” (_atrocior aspide, dracone, lynce, et\r\nbasilico_). For a long time England troubled herself as much concerning\r\nthe gipsies, of whom she wished to be rid as about the wolves of which\r\nshe had been cleared. In that the Englishman differed from the Irishman,\r\nwho prayed to the saints for the health of the wolf, and called him “my\r\ngodfather.”\r\n\r\nEnglish law, nevertheless, in the same way as (we have just seen) it\r\ntolerated the wolf, tamed, domesticated, and become in some sort a dog,\r\ntolerated the regular vagabond, become in some sort a subject. It did\r\nnot trouble itself about either the mountebank or the travelling barber,\r\nor the quack doctor, or the peddler, or the open-air scholar, as long as\r\nthey had a trade to live by. Further than this, and with these\r\nexceptions, the description of freedom which exists in the wanderer\r\nterrified the law. A tramp was a possible public enemy. That modern\r\nthing, the lounger, was then unknown; that ancient thing, the vagrant,\r\nwas alone understood. A suspicious appearance, that indescribable\r\nsomething which all understand and none can define, was sufficient\r\nreason that society should take a man by the collar. “Where do you live?\r\nHow do you get your living?” And if he could not answer, harsh penalties\r\nawaited him. Iron and fire were in the code: the law practised the\r\ncauterization of vagrancy.\r\n\r\nHence, throughout English territory, a veritable “loi des suspects” was\r\napplicable to vagrants (who, it must be owned, readily became\r\nmalefactors), and particularly to gipsies, whose expulsion has\r\nerroneously been compared to the expulsion of the Jews and the Moors\r\nfrom Spain, and the Protestants from France. As for us, we do not\r\nconfound a battue with a persecution.\r\n\r\nThe Comprachicos, we insist, had nothing in common with the gipsies. The\r\ngipsies were a nation; the Comprachicos were a compound of all\r\nnations--the lees of a horrible vessel full of filthy waters. The\r\nComprachicos had not, like the gipsies, an idiom of their own; their\r\njargon was a promiscuous collection of idioms: all languages were mixed\r\ntogether in their language; they spoke a medley. Like the gipsies, they\r\nhad come to be a people winding through the peoples; but their common\r\ntie was association, not race. At all epochs in history one finds in the\r\nvast liquid mass which constitutes humanity some of these streams of\r\nvenomous men exuding poison around them. The gipsies were a tribe; the\r\nComprachicos a freemasonry--a masonry having not a noble aim, but a\r\nhideous handicraft. Finally, their religions differ--the gipsies were\r\nPagans, the Comprachicos were Christians, and more than that, good\r\nChristians, as became an association which, although a mixture of all\r\nnations, owed its birth to Spain, a devout land.\r\n\r\nThey were more than Christians, they were Catholics; they were more than\r\nCatholics, they were Romans, and so touchy in their faith, and so pure,\r\nthat they refused to associate with the Hungarian nomads of the comitate\r\nof Pesth, commanded and led by an old man, having for sceptre a wand\r\nwith a silver ball, surmounted by the double-headed Austrian eagle. It\r\nis true that these Hungarians were schismatics, to the extent of\r\ncelebrating the Assumption on the 29th August, which is an abomination.\r\n\r\nIn England, so long as the Stuarts reigned, the confederation of the\r\nComprachicos was (for motives of which we have already given you a\r\nglimpse) to a certain extent protected. James II., a devout man, who\r\npersecuted the Jews and trampled out the gipsies, was a good prince to\r\nthe Comprachicos. We have seen why. The Comprachicos were buyers of the\r\nhuman wares in which he was dealer. They excelled in disappearances.\r\nDisappearances are occasionally necessary for the good of the state. An\r\ninconvenient heir of tender age whom they took and handled lost his\r\nshape. This facilitated confiscation; the tranfer of titles to\r\nfavourites was simplified. The Comprachicos were, moreover, very\r\ndiscreet and very taciturn. They bound themselves to silence, and kept\r\ntheir word, which is necessary in affairs of state. There was scarcely\r\nan example of their having betrayed the secrets of the king. This was,\r\nit is true, for their interest; and if the king had lost confidence in\r\nthem, they would have been in great danger. They were thus of use in a\r\npolitical point of view. Moreover these artists furnished singers for\r\nthe Holy Father. The Comprachicos were useful for the _Miserere_ of\r\nAllegri. They were particularly devoted to Mary. All this pleased the\r\npapistry of the Stuarts. James II. could not be hostile to holy men who\r\npushed their devotion to the Virgin to the extent of manufacturing\r\neunuchs. In 1688 there was a change of dynasty in England: Orange\r\nsupplanted Stuart. William III. replaced James II.\r\n\r\nJames II. went away to die in exile, miracles were performed on his\r\ntomb, and his relics cured the Bishop of Autun of fistula--a worthy\r\nrecompense of the Christian virtues of the prince.\r\n\r\nWilliam, having neither the same ideas nor the same practices as James,\r\nwas severe to the Comprachicos. He did his best to crush out the vermin.\r\n\r\nA statute of the early part of William and Mary’s reign hit the\r\nassociation of child-buyers hard. It was as the blow of a club to the\r\nComprachicos, who were from that time pulverized. By the terms of this\r\nstatute those of the fellowship taken and duly convicted were to be\r\nbranded with a red-hot iron, imprinting R. on the shoulder, signifying\r\nrogue; on the left hand T, signifying thief; and on the right hand M,\r\nsignifying man-slayer. The chiefs, “supposed to be rich, although\r\nbeggars in appearance,” were to be punished in the _collistrigium_--that\r\nis, the pillory--and branded on the forehead with a P, besides having\r\ntheir goods confiscated, and the trees in their woods rooted up. Those\r\nwho did not inform against the Comprachicos were to be punished by\r\nconfiscation and imprisonment for life, as for the crime of misprision.\r\nAs for the women found among these men, they were to suffer the\r\ncucking-stool--this is a tumbrel, the name of which is composed of the\r\nFrench word _coquine_, and the German _stuhl_. English law being endowed\r\nwith a strange longevity, this punishment still exists in English\r\nlegislation for quarrelsome women. The cucking-stool is suspended over a\r\nriver or a pond, the woman seated on it. The chair is allowed to drop\r\ninto the water, and then pulled out. This dipping of the woman is\r\nrepeated three times, “to cool her anger,” says the commentator,\r\nChamberlayne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FIRST.\r\n\r\n_NIGHT NOT SO BLACK AS MAN_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPORTLAND BILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn obstinate north wind blew without ceasing over the mainland of\r\nEurope, and yet more roughly over England, during all the month of\r\nDecember, 1689, and all the month of January, 1690. Hence the disastrous\r\ncold weather, which caused that winter to be noted as “memorable to the\r\npoor,” on the margin of the old Bible in the Presbyterian chapel of the\r\nNonjurors in London. Thanks to the lasting qualities of the old\r\nmonarchical parchment employed in official registers, long lists of poor\r\npersons, found dead of famine and cold, are still legible in many local\r\nrepositories, particularly in the archives of the Liberty of the Clink,\r\nin the borough of Southwark, of Pie Powder Court (which signifies Dusty\r\nFeet Court), and in those of Whitechapel Court, held in the village of\r\nStepney by the bailiff of the Lord of the Manor. The Thames was frozen\r\nover--a thing which does not happen once in a century, as the ice forms\r\non it with difficulty owing to the action of the sea. Coaches rolled\r\nover the frozen river, and a fair was held with booths, bear-baiting,\r\nand bull-baiting. An ox was roasted whole on the ice. This thick ice\r\nlasted two months. The hard year 1690 surpassed in severity even the\r\nfamous winters at the beginning of the seventeenth century, so minutely\r\nobserved by Dr. Gideon Delane--the same who was, in his quality of\r\napothecary to King James, honoured by the city of London with a bust and\r\na pedestal.\r\n\r\nOne evening, towards the close of one of the most bitter days of the\r\nmonth of January, 1690, something unusual was going on in one of the\r\nnumerous inhospitable bights of the bay of Portland, which caused the\r\nsea-gulls and wild geese to scream and circle round its mouth, not\r\ndaring to re-enter.\r\n\r\nIn this creek, the most dangerous of all which line the bay during the\r\ncontinuance of certain winds, and consequently the most\r\nlonely--convenient, by reason of its very danger, for ships in hiding--a\r\nlittle vessel, almost touching the cliff, so deep was the water, was\r\nmoored to a point of rock. We are wrong in saying, The night falls; we\r\nshould say the night rises, for it is from the earth that obscurity\r\ncomes. It was already night at the bottom of the cliff; it was still day\r\nat top. Any one approaching the vessel’s moorings would have recognized\r\na Biscayan hooker.\r\n\r\nThe sun, concealed all day by the mist, had just set. There was\r\nbeginning to be felt that deep and sombrous melancholy which might be\r\ncalled anxiety for the absent sun. With no wind from the sea, the water\r\nof the creek was calm.\r\n\r\nThis was, especially in winter, a lucky exception. Almost all the\r\nPortland creeks have sand-bars; and in heavy weather the sea becomes\r\nvery rough, and, to pass in safety, much skill and practice are\r\nnecessary. These little ports (ports more in appearance than fact) are\r\nof small advantage. They are hazardous to enter, fearful to leave. On\r\nthis evening, for a wonder, there was no danger.\r\n\r\nThe Biscay hooker is of an ancient model, now fallen into disuse. This\r\nkind of hooker, which has done service even in the navy, was stoutly\r\nbuilt in its hull--a boat in size, a ship in strength. It figured in the\r\nArmada. Sometimes the war-hooker attained to a high tonnage; thus the\r\nGreat Griffin, bearing a captain’s flag, and commanded by Lopez de\r\nMedina, measured six hundred and fifty good tons, and carried forty\r\nguns. But the merchant and contraband hookers were very feeble\r\nspecimens. Sea-folk held them at their true value, and esteemed the\r\nmodel a very sorry one, The rigging of the hooker was made of hemp,\r\nsometimes with wire inside, which was probably intended as a means,\r\nhowever unscientific, of obtaining indications, in the case of magnetic\r\ntension. The lightness of this rigging did not exclude the use of heavy\r\ntackle, the cabrias of the Spanish galleon, and the cameli of the Roman\r\ntriremes. The helm was very long, which gives the advantage of a long\r\narm of leverage, but the disadvantage of a small arc of effort. Two\r\nwheels in two pulleys at the end of the rudder corrected this defect,\r\nand compensated, to some extent, for the loss of strength. The compass\r\nwas well housed in a case perfectly square, and well balanced by its two\r\ncopper frames placed horizontally, one in the other, on little bolts, as\r\nin Cardan’s lamps. There was science and cunning in the construction of\r\nthe hooker, but it was ignorant science and barbarous cunning. The\r\nhooker was primitive, just like the praam and the canoe; was kindred to\r\nthe praam in stability, and to the canoe in swiftness; and, like all\r\nvessels born of the instinct of the pirate and fisherman, it had\r\nremarkable sea qualities: it was equally well suited to landlocked and\r\nto open waters. Its system of sails, complicated in stays, and very\r\npeculiar, allowed of its navigating trimly in the close bays of Asturias\r\n(which are little more than enclosed basins, as Pasages, for instance),\r\nand also freely out at sea. It could sail round a lake, and sail round\r\nthe world--a strange craft with two objects, good for a pond and good\r\nfor a storm. The hooker is among vessels what the wagtail is among\r\nbirds--one of the smallest and one of the boldest. The wagtail perching\r\non a reed scarcely bends it, and, flying away, crosses the ocean.\r\n\r\nThese Biscay hookers, even to the poorest, were gilt and painted.\r\nTattooing is part of the genius of those charming people, savages to\r\nsome degree. The sublime colouring of their mountains, variegated by\r\nsnows and meadows, reveals to them the rugged spell which ornament\r\npossesses in itself. They are poverty-stricken and magnificent; they put\r\ncoats-of-arms on their cottages; they have huge asses, which they\r\nbedizen with bells, and huge oxen, on which they put head-dresses of\r\nfeathers. Their coaches, which you can hear grinding the wheels two\r\nleagues off, are illuminated, carved, and hung with ribbons. A cobbler\r\nhas a bas-relief on his door: it is only St. Crispin and an old shoe,\r\nbut it is in stone. They trim their leathern jackets with lace. They do\r\nnot mend their rags, but they embroider them. Vivacity profound and\r\nsuperb! The Basques are, like the Greeks, children of the sun; while the\r\nValencian drapes himself, bare and sad, in his russet woollen rug, with\r\na hole to pass his head through, the natives of Galicia and Biscay have\r\nthe delight of fine linen shirts, bleached in the dew. Their thresholds\r\nand their windows teem with faces fair and fresh, laughing under\r\ngarlands of maize; a joyous and proud serenity shines out in their\r\ningenious arts, in their trades, in their customs, in the dress of their\r\nmaidens, in their songs. The mountain, that colossal ruin, is all aglow\r\nin Biscay: the sun’s rays go in and out of every break. The wild\r\nJaïzquivel is full of idylls. Biscay is Pyrenean grace as Savoy is\r\nAlpine grace. The dangerous bays--the neighbours of St. Sebastian, Leso,\r\nand Fontarabia--with storms, with clouds, with spray flying over the\r\ncapes, with the rages of the waves and the winds, with terror, with\r\nuproar, mingle boat-women crowned with roses. He who has seen the Basque\r\ncountry wishes to see it again. It is the blessed land. Two harvests a\r\nyear; villages resonant and gay; a stately poverty; all Sunday the sound\r\nof guitars, dancing, castanets, love-making; houses clean and bright;\r\nstorks in the belfries.\r\n\r\nLet us return to Portland--that rugged mountain in the sea.\r\n\r\nThe peninsula of Portland, looked at geometrically, presents the\r\nappearance of a bird’s head, of which the bill is turned towards the\r\nocean, the back of the head towards Weymouth; the isthmus is its neck.\r\n\r\nPortland, greatly to the sacrifice of its wildness, exists now but for\r\ntrade. The coasts of Portland were discovered by quarrymen and\r\nplasterers towards the middle of the seventeenth century. Since that\r\nperiod what is called Roman cement has been made of the Portland\r\nstone--a useful industry, enriching the district, and disfiguring the\r\nbay. Two hundred years ago these coasts were eaten away as a cliff;\r\nto-day, as a quarry. The pick bites meanly, the wave grandly; hence a\r\ndiminution of beauty. To the magnificent ravages of the ocean have\r\nsucceeded the measured strokes of men. These measured strokes have\r\nworked away the creek where the Biscay hooker was moored. To find any\r\nvestige of the little anchorage, now destroyed, the eastern side of the\r\npeninsula should be searched, towards the point beyond Folly Pier and\r\nDirdle Pier, beyond Wakeham even, between the place called Church Hope\r\nand the place called Southwell.\r\n\r\nThe creek, walled in on all sides by precipices higher than its width,\r\nwas minute by minute becoming more overshadowed by evening. The misty\r\ngloom, usual at twilight, became thicker; it was like a growth of\r\ndarkness at the bottom of a well. The opening of the creek seaward, a\r\nnarrow passage, traced on the almost night-black interior a pallid rift\r\nwhere the waves were moving. You must have been quite close to perceive\r\nthe hooker moored to the rocks, and, as it were, hidden by the great\r\ncloaks of shadow. A plank thrown from on board on to a low and level\r\nprojection of the cliff, the only point on which a landing could be\r\nmade, placed the vessel in communication with the land. Dark figures\r\nwere crossing and recrossing each other on this tottering gangway, and\r\nin the shadow some people were embarking.\r\n\r\nIt was less cold in the creek than out at sea, thanks to the screen of\r\nrock rising over the north of the basin, which did not, however, prevent\r\nthe people from shivering. They were hurrying. The effect of the\r\ntwilight defined the forms as though they had been punched out with a\r\ntool. Certain indentations in their clothes were visible, and showed\r\nthat they belonged to the class called in England the ragged.\r\n\r\nThe twisting of the pathway could be distinguished vaguely in the relief\r\nof the cliff. A girl who lets her stay-lace hang down trailing over the\r\nback of an armchair, describes, without being conscious of it, most of\r\nthe paths of cliffs and mountains. The pathway of this creek, full of\r\nknots and angles, almost perpendicular, and better adapted for goats\r\nthan men, terminated on the platform where the plank was placed. The\r\npathways of cliffs ordinarily imply a not very inviting declivity; they\r\noffer themselves less as a road than as a fall; they sink rather than\r\nincline. This one--probably some ramification of a road on the plain\r\nabove--was disagreeable to look at, so vertical was it. From underneath\r\nyou saw it gain by zigzag the higher layer of the cliff where it passed\r\nout through deep passages on to the high plateau by a cutting in the\r\nrock; and the passengers for whom the vessel was waiting in the creek\r\nmust have come by this path.\r\n\r\nExcepting the movement of embarkation which was being made in the creek,\r\na movement visibly scared and uneasy, all around was solitude; no step,\r\nno noise, no breath was heard. At the other side of the roads, at the\r\nentrance of Ringstead Bay, you could just perceive a flotilla of\r\nshark-fishing boats, which were evidently out of their reckoning. These\r\npolar boats had been driven from Danish into English waters by the whims\r\nof the sea. Northerly winds play these tricks on fishermen. They had\r\njust taken refuge in the anchorage of Portland--a sign of bad weather\r\nexpected and danger out at sea. They were engaged in casting anchor: the\r\nchief boat, placed in front after the old manner of Norwegian flotillas,\r\nall her rigging standing out in black, above the white level of the sea;\r\nand in front might be perceived the hook-iron, loaded with all kinds of\r\nhooks and harpoons, destined for the Greenland shark, the dogfish, and\r\nthe spinous shark, as well as the nets to pick up the sunfish.\r\n\r\nExcept a few other craft, all swept into the same corner, the eye met\r\nnothing living on the vast horizon of Portland--not a house, not a ship.\r\nThe coast in those days was not inhabited, and the roads, at that\r\nseason, were not safe.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the appearance of the weather, the beings who\r\nwere going to sail away in the Biscayan urca pressed on the hour of\r\ndeparture all the same. They formed a busy and confused group, in rapid\r\nmovement on the shore. To distinguish one from another was difficult;\r\nimpossible to tell whether they were old or young. The indistinctness of\r\nevening intermixed and blurred them; the mask of shadow was over their\r\nfaces. They were sketches in the night. There were eight of them, and\r\nthere were seemingly among them one or two women, hard to recognize\r\nunder the rags and tatters in which the group was attired--clothes which\r\nwere no longer man’s or woman’s. Rags have no sex.\r\n\r\nA smaller shadow, flitting to and fro among the larger ones, indicated\r\neither a dwarf or a child.\r\n\r\nIt was a child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLEFT ALONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is what an observer close at hand might have noted.\r\n\r\nAll wore long cloaks, torn and patched, but covering them, and at need\r\nconcealing them up to the eyes; useful alike against the north wind and\r\ncuriosity. They moved with ease under these cloaks. The greater number\r\nwore a handkerchief rolled round the head--a sort of rudiment which\r\nmarks the commencement of the turban in Spain. This headdress was\r\nnothing unusual in England. At that time the South was in fashion in the\r\nNorth; perhaps this was connected with the fact that the North was\r\nbeating the South. It conquered and admired. After the defeat of the\r\nArmada, Castilian was considered in the halls of Elizabeth to be elegant\r\ncourt talk. To speak English in the palace of the Queen of England was\r\nheld almost an impropriety. Partially to adopt the manners of those upon\r\nwhom we impose our laws is the habit of the conquering barbarian towards\r\nconquered civilization. The Tartar contemplates and imitates the\r\nChinese. It was thus Castilian fashions penetrated into England; in\r\nreturn, English interests crept into Spain.\r\n\r\nOne of the men in the group embarking appeared to be a chief. He had\r\nsandals on his feet, and was bedizened with gold lace tatters and a\r\ntinsel waistcoat, shining under his cloak like the belly of a fish.\r\nAnother pulled down over his face a huge piece of felt, cut like a\r\nsombrero; this felt had no hole for a pipe, thus indicating the wearer\r\nto be a man of letters.\r\n\r\nOn the principle that a man’s vest is a child’s cloak, the child was\r\nwrapped over his rags in a sailor’s jacket, which descended to his\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nBy his height you would have guessed him to be a boy of ten or eleven;\r\nhis feet were bare.\r\n\r\nThe crew of the hooker was composed of a captain and two sailors.\r\n\r\nThe hooker had apparently come from Spain, and was about to return\r\nthither. She was beyond a doubt engaged in a stealthy service from one\r\ncoast to the other.\r\n\r\nThe persons embarking in her whispered among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe whispering interchanged by these creatures was of composite\r\nsound--now a word of Spanish, then of German, then of French, then of\r\nGaelic, at times of Basque. It was either a patois or a slang. They\r\nappeared to be of all nations, and yet of the same band.\r\n\r\nThe motley group appeared to be a company of comrades, perhaps a gang of\r\naccomplices.\r\n\r\nThe crew was probably of their brotherhood. Community of object was\r\nvisible in the embarkation.\r\n\r\nHad there been a little more light, and if you could have looked at them\r\nattentively, you might have perceived on these people rosaries and\r\nscapulars half hidden under their rags; one of the semi-women mingling\r\nin the group had a rosary almost equal for the size of its beads to that\r\nof a dervish, and easy to recognize for an Irish one made at\r\nLlanymthefry, which is also called Llanandriffy.\r\n\r\nYou might also have observed, had it not been so dark, a figure of Our\r\nLady and Child carved and gilt on the bow of the hooker. It was probably\r\nthat of the Basque Notre Dame, a sort of Panagia of the old Cantabri.\r\nUnder this image, which occupied the position of a figurehead, was a\r\nlantern, which at this moment was not lighted--an excess of caution\r\nwhich implied an extreme desire of concealment. This lantern was\r\nevidently for two purposes. When alight it burned before the Virgin, and\r\nat the same time illumined the sea--a beacon doing duty as a taper.\r\n\r\nUnder the bowsprit the cutwater, long, curved, and sharp, came out in\r\nfront like the horn of a crescent. At the top of the cutwater, and at\r\nthe feet of the Virgin, a kneeling angel, with folded wings, leaned her\r\nback against the stem, and looked through a spyglass at the horizon. The\r\nangel was gilded like Our Lady. In the cutwater were holes and openings\r\nto let the waves pass through, which afforded an opportunity for gilding\r\nand arabesques.\r\n\r\nUnder the figure of the Virgin was written, in gilt capitals, the word\r\n_Matutina_--the name of the vessel, not to be read just now on account\r\nof the darkness.\r\n\r\nAmid the confusion of departure there were thrown down in disorder, at\r\nthe foot of the cliff, the goods which the voyagers were to take with\r\nthem, and which, by means of a plank serving as a bridge across, were\r\nbeing passed rapidly from the shore to the boat. Bags of biscuit, a cask\r\nof stock fish, a case of portable soup, three barrels--one of fresh\r\nwater, one of malt, one of tar--four or five bottles of ale, an old\r\nportmanteau buckled up by straps, trunks, boxes, a ball of tow for\r\ntorches and signals--such was the lading. These ragged people had\r\nvalises, which seemed to indicate a roving life. Wandering rascals are\r\nobliged to own something; at times they would prefer to fly away like\r\nbirds, but they cannot do so without abandoning the means of earning a\r\nlivelihood. They of necessity possess boxes of tools and instruments of\r\nlabour, whatever their errant trade may be. Those of whom we speak were\r\ndragging their baggage with them, often an encumbrance.\r\n\r\nIt could not have been easy to bring these movables to the bottom of the\r\ncliff. This, however, revealed the intention of a definite departure.\r\n\r\nNo time was lost; there was one continued passing to and fro from the\r\nshore to the vessel, and from the vessel to the shore; each one took his\r\nshare of the work--one carried a bag, another a chest. Those amidst the\r\npromiscuous company who were possibly or probably women worked like the\r\nrest. They overloaded the child.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtful if the child’s father or mother were in the group; no\r\nsign of life was vouchsafed him. They made him work, nothing more. He\r\nappeared not a child in a family, but a slave in a tribe. He waited on\r\nevery one, and no one spoke to him.\r\n\r\nHowever, he made haste, and, like the others of this mysterious troop,\r\nhe seemed to have but one thought--to embark as quickly as possible. Did\r\nhe know why? probably not: he hurried mechanically because he saw the\r\nothers hurry.\r\n\r\nThe hooker was decked. The stowing of the lading in the hold was quickly\r\nfinished, and the moment to put off arrived. The last case had been\r\ncarried over the gangway, and nothing was left to embark but the men.\r\nThe two objects among the group who seemed women were already on board;\r\nsix, the child among them, were still on the low platform of the cliff.\r\nA movement of departure was made in the vessel: the captain seized the\r\nhelm, a sailor took up an axe to cut the hawser--to cut is an evidence\r\nof haste; when there is time it is unknotted.\r\n\r\n“Andamos,” said, in a low voice, he who appeared chief of the six, and\r\nwho had the spangles on his tatters. The child rushed towards the plank\r\nin order to be the first to pass. As he placed his foot on it, two of\r\nthe men hurried by, at the risk of throwing him into the water, got in\r\nbefore him, and passed on; the fourth drove him back with his fist and\r\nfollowed the third; the fifth, who was the chief, bounded into rather\r\nthan entered the vessel, and, as he jumped in, kicked back the plank,\r\nwhich fell into the sea, a stroke of the hatchet cut the moorings, the\r\nhelm was put up, the vessel left the shore, and the child remained on\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nALONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe child remained motionless on the rock, with his eyes fixed--no\r\ncalling out, no appeal. Though this was unexpected by him, he spoke not\r\na word. The same silence reigned in the vessel. No cry from the child to\r\nthe men--no farewell from the men to the child. There was on both sides\r\na mute acceptance of the widening distance between them. It was like a\r\nseparation of ghosts on the banks of the Styx. The child, as if nailed\r\nto the rock, which the high tide was beginning to bathe, watched the\r\ndeparting bark. It seemed as if he realized his position. What did he\r\nrealize? Darkness.\r\n\r\nA moment later the hooker gained the neck of the crook and entered it.\r\nAgainst the clear sky the masthead was visible, rising above the split\r\nblocks between which the strait wound as between two walls. The truck\r\nwandered to the summit of the rocks, and appeared to run into them. Then\r\nit was seen no more--all was over--the bark had gained the sea.\r\n\r\nThe child watched its disappearance--he was astounded but dreamy. His\r\nstupefaction was complicated by a sense of the dark reality of\r\nexistence. It seemed as if there were experience in this dawning being.\r\nDid he, perchance, already exercise judgment? Experience coming too\r\nearly constructs, sometimes, in the obscure depths of a child’s mind,\r\nsome dangerous balance--we know not what--in which the poor little soul\r\nweighs God.\r\n\r\nFeeling himself innocent, he yielded. There was no complaint--the\r\nirreproachable does not reproach.\r\n\r\nHis rough expulsion drew from him no sign; he suffered a sort of\r\ninternal stiffening. The child did not bow under this sudden blow of\r\nfate, which seemed to put an end to his existence ere it had well begun;\r\nhe received the thunderstroke standing.\r\n\r\nIt would have been evident to any one who could have seen his\r\nastonishment unmixed with dejection, that in the group which abandoned\r\nhim there was nothing which loved him, nothing which he loved.\r\n\r\nBrooding, he forgot the cold. Suddenly the wave wetted his feet--the\r\ntide was flowing; a gust passed through his hair--the north wind was\r\nrising. He shivered. There came over him, from head to foot, the shudder\r\nof awakening.\r\n\r\nHe cast his eyes about him.\r\n\r\nHe was alone.\r\n\r\nUp to this day there had never existed for him any other men than those\r\nwho were now in the hooker. Those men had just stolen away.\r\n\r\nLet us add what seems a strange thing to state. Those men, the only\r\nones he knew, were unknown to him.\r\n\r\nHe could not have said who they were. His childhood had been passed\r\namong them, without his having the consciousness of being of them. He\r\nwas in juxtaposition to them, nothing more.\r\n\r\nHe had just been--forgotten--by them.\r\n\r\nHe had no money about him, no shoes to his feet, scarcely a garment to\r\nhis body, not even a piece of bread in his pocket.\r\n\r\nIt was winter--it was night. It would be necessary to walk several\r\nleagues before a human habitation could be reached.\r\n\r\nHe did not know where he was.\r\n\r\nHe knew nothing, unless it was that those who had come with him to the\r\nbrink of the sea had gone away without him.\r\n\r\nHe felt himself put outside the pale of life.\r\n\r\nHe felt that man failed him.\r\n\r\nHe was ten years old.\r\n\r\nThe child was in a desert, between depths where he saw the night rising\r\nand depths where he heard the waves murmur.\r\n\r\nHe stretched his little thin arms and yawned.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, as one who makes up his mind, bold, and throwing off his\r\nnumbness--with the agility of a squirrel, or perhaps of an acrobat--he\r\nturned his back on the creek, and set himself to climb up the cliff. He\r\nescaladed the path, left it, returned to it, quick and venturous. He was\r\nhurrying landward, just as though he had a destination marked out;\r\nnevertheless he was going nowhere.\r\n\r\nHe hastened without an object--a fugitive before Fate.\r\n\r\nTo climb is the function of a man; to clamber is that of an animal--he\r\ndid both. As the slopes of Portland face southward, there was scarcely\r\nany snow on the path; the intensity of cold had, however, frozen that\r\nsnow into dust very troublesome to the walker. The child freed himself\r\nof it. His man’s jacket, which was too big for him, complicated matters,\r\nand got in his way. Now and then on an overhanging crag or in a\r\ndeclivity he came upon a little ice, which caused him to slip down.\r\nThen, after hanging some moments over the precipice, he would catch\r\nhold of a dry branch or projecting stone. Once he came on a vein of\r\nslate, which suddenly gave way under him, letting him down with it.\r\nCrumbling slate is treacherous. For some seconds the child slid like a\r\ntile on a roof; he rolled to the extreme edge of the decline; a tuft of\r\ngrass which he clutched at the right moment saved him. He was as mute in\r\nsight of the abyss as he had been in sight of the men; he gathered\r\nhimself up and re-ascended silently. The slope was steep; so he had to\r\ntack in ascending. The precipice grew in the darkness; the vertical rock\r\nhad no ending. It receded before the child in the distance of its\r\nheight. As the child ascended, so seemed the summit to ascend. While he\r\nclambered he looked up at the dark entablature placed like a barrier\r\nbetween heaven and him. At last he reached the top.\r\n\r\nHe jumped on the level ground, or rather landed, for he rose from the\r\nprecipice.\r\n\r\nScarcely was he on the cliff when he began to shiver. He felt in his\r\nface that bite of the night, the north wind. The bitter north-wester was\r\nblowing; he tightened his rough sailor’s jacket about his chest.\r\n\r\nIt was a good coat, called in ship language a sou-’wester, because that\r\nsort of stuff allows little of the south-westerly rain to penetrate.\r\n\r\nThe child, having gained the tableland, stopped, placed his feet firmly\r\non the frozen ground, and looked about him.\r\n\r\nBehind him was the sea; in front the land; above, the sky--but a sky\r\nwithout stars; an opaque mist masked the zenith.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the summit of the rocky wall he found himself turned towards\r\nthe land, and looked at it attentively. It lay before him as far as the\r\nsky-line, flat, frozen, and covered with snow. Some tufts of heather\r\nshivered in the wind. No roads were visible--nothing, not even a\r\nshepherd’s cot. Here and there pale spiral vortices might be seen, which\r\nwere whirls of fine snow, snatched from the ground by the wind and blown\r\naway. Successive undulations of ground, become suddenly misty, rolled\r\nthemselves into the horizon. The great dull plains were lost under the\r\nwhite fog. Deep silence. It spread like infinity, and was hush as the\r\ntomb.\r\n\r\nThe child turned again towards the sea.\r\n\r\nThe sea, like the land, was white--the one with snow, the other with\r\nfoam. There is nothing so melancholy as the light produced by this\r\ndouble whiteness.\r\n\r\nCertain lights of night are very clearly cut in their hardness; the sea\r\nwas like steel, the cliff like ebony. From the height where the child\r\nwas the bay of Portland appeared almost like a geographical map, pale,\r\nin a semicircle of hills. There was something dreamlike in that\r\nnocturnal landscape--a wan disc belted by a dark crescent. The moon\r\nsometimes has a similar appearance. From cape to cape, along the whole\r\ncoast, not a single spark indicating a hearth with a fire, not a lighted\r\nwindow, not an inhabited house, was to be seen. As in heaven, so on\r\nearth--no light. Not a lamp below, not a star above. Here and there came\r\nsudden risings in the great expanse of waters in the gulf, as the wind\r\ndisarranged and wrinkled the vast sheet. The hooker was still visible in\r\nthe bay as she fled.\r\n\r\nIt was a black triangle gliding over the livid waters.\r\n\r\nFar away the waste of waters stirred confusedly in the ominous\r\nclear-obscure of immensity. The _Matutina_ was making quick way. She\r\nseemed to grow smaller every minute. Nothing appears so rapid as the\r\nflight of a vessel melting into the distance of ocean.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she lit the lantern at her prow. Probably the darkness falling\r\nround her made those on board uneasy, and the pilot thought it necessary\r\nto throw light on the waves. This luminous point, a spark seen from\r\nafar, clung like a corpse light to the high and long black form. You\r\nwould have said it was a shroud raised up and moving in the middle of\r\nthe sea, under which some one wandered with a star in his hand.\r\n\r\nA storm threatened in the air; the child took no account of it, but a\r\nsailor would have trembled. It was that moment of preliminary anxiety\r\nwhen it seems as though the elements are changing into persons, and one\r\nis about to witness the mysterious transfiguration of the wind into the\r\nwind-god. The sea becomes Ocean: its power reveals itself as Will: that\r\nwhich one takes for a thing is a soul. It will become visible; hence the\r\nterror. The soul of man fears to be thus confronted with the soul of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nChaos was about to appear. The wind rolling back the fog, and making a\r\nstage of the clouds behind, set the scene for that fearful drama of wave\r\nand winter which is called a Snowstorm. Vessels putting back hove in\r\nsight. For some minutes past the roads had no longer been deserted.\r\nEvery instant troubled barks hastening towards an anchorage appeared\r\nfrom behind the capes; some were doubling Portland Bill, the others St.\r\nAlban’s Head. From afar ships were running in. It was a race for refuge.\r\nSouthwards the darkness thickened, and clouds, full of night, bordered\r\non the sea. The weight of the tempest hanging overhead made a dreary\r\nlull on the waves. It certainly was no time to sail. Yet the hooker had\r\nsailed.\r\n\r\nShe had made the south of the cape. She was already out of the gulf, and\r\nin the open sea. Suddenly there came a gust of wind. The _Matutina_,\r\nwhich was still clearly in sight, made all sail, as if resolved to\r\nprofit by the hurricane. It was the nor’-wester, a wind sullen and\r\nangry. Its weight was felt instantly. The hooker, caught broadside on,\r\nstaggered, but recovering held her course to sea. This indicated a\r\nflight rather than a voyage, less fear of sea than of land, and greater\r\nheed of pursuit from man than from wind.\r\n\r\nThe hooker, passing through every degree of diminution, sank into the\r\nhorizon. The little star which she carried into shadow paled. More and\r\nmore the hooker became amalgamated with the night, then disappeared.\r\n\r\nThis time for good and all.\r\n\r\nAt least the child seemed to understand it so: he ceased to look at the\r\nsea. His eyes turned back upon the plains, the wastes, the hills,\r\ntowards the space where it might not be impossible to meet something\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nInto this unknown he set out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat kind of band was it which had left the child behind in its flight?\r\n\r\nWere those fugitives Comprachicos?\r\n\r\nWe have already seen the account of the measures taken by William III.\r\nand passed by Parliament against the malefactors, male and female,\r\ncalled Comprachicos, otherwise Comprapequeños, otherwise Cheylas.\r\n\r\nThere are laws which disperse. The law acting against the Comprachicos\r\ndetermined, not only the Comprachicos, but vagabonds of all sorts, on a\r\ngeneral flight.\r\n\r\nIt was the devil take the hindmost. The greater number of the\r\nComprachicos returned to Spain--many of them, as we have said, being\r\nBasques.\r\n\r\nThe law for the protection of children had at first this strange result:\r\nit caused many children to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of the penal statute was to produce a crowd of\r\nchildren, found or rather lost. Nothing is easier to understand. Every\r\nwandering gang containing a child was liable to suspicion. The mere fact\r\nof the child’s presence was in itself a denunciation.\r\n\r\n“They are very likely Comprachicos.” Such was the first idea of the\r\nsheriff, of the bailiff, of the constable. Hence arrest and inquiry.\r\nPeople simply unfortunate, reduced to wander and to beg, were seized\r\nwith a terror of being taken for Comprachicos although they were nothing\r\nof the kind. But the weak have grave misgivings of possible errors in\r\njustice. Besides, these vagabond families are very easily scared. The\r\naccusation against the Comprachicos was that they traded in other\r\npeople’s children. But the promiscuousness caused by poverty and\r\nindigence is such that at times it might have been difficult for a\r\nfather and mother to prove a child their own.\r\n\r\nHow came you by this child? how were they to prove that they held it\r\nfrom God? The child became a peril--they got rid of it. To fly\r\nunencumbered was easier; the parents resolved to lose it--now in a wood,\r\nnow on a strand, now down a well.\r\n\r\nChildren were found drowned in cisterns.\r\n\r\nLet us add that, in imitation of England, all Europe henceforth hunted\r\ndown the Comprachicos. The impulse of pursuit was given. There is\r\nnothing like belling the cat. From this time forward the desire to seize\r\nthem made rivalry and emulation among the police of all countries, and\r\nthe alguazil was not less keenly watchful than the constable.\r\n\r\nOne could still read, twenty-three years ago, on a stone of the gate of\r\nOtero, an untranslatable inscription--the words of the code outraging\r\npropriety. In it, however, the shade of difference which existed between\r\nthe buyers and the stealers of children is very strongly marked. Here is\r\npart of the inscription in somewhat rough Castillan, _Aqui quedan las\r\norejas de los Comprachicos, y las bolsas de los robaniños, mientras que\r\nse van ellos al trabajo de mar_. You see the confiscation of ears, etc.,\r\ndid not prevent the owners going to the galleys. Whence followed a\r\ngeneral rout among all vagabonds. They started frightened; they arrived\r\ntrembling. On every shore in Europe their furtive advent was watched.\r\nImpossible for such a band to embark with a child, since to disembark\r\nwith one was dangerous.\r\n\r\nTo lose the child was much simpler of accomplishment.\r\n\r\nAnd this child, of whom we have caught a glimpse in the shadow of the\r\nsolitudes of Portland, by whom had he been cast away?\r\n\r\nTo all appearance by Comprachicos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE TREE OF HUMAN INVENTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt might be about seven o’clock in the evening. The wind was now\r\ndiminishing--a sign, however, of a violent recurrence impending. The\r\nchild was on the table-land at the extreme south point of Portland.\r\n\r\nPortland is a peninsula; but the child did not know what a peninsula\r\nis, and was ignorant even of the name of Portland. He knew but one\r\nthing, which is, that one can walk until one drops down. An idea is a\r\nguide; he had no idea. They had brought him there and left him there.\r\n_They_ and _there_--these two enigmas represented his doom. _They_ were\r\nhumankind. _There_ was the universe. For him in all creation there was\r\nabsolutely no other basis to rest on but the little piece of ground\r\nwhere he placed his heel, ground hard and cold to his naked feet. In the\r\ngreat twilight world, open on all sides, what was there for the child?\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nHe walked towards this Nothing. Around him was the vastness of human\r\ndesertion.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the first plateau diagonally, then a second, then a third. At\r\nthe extremity of each plateau the child came upon a break in the ground.\r\nThe slope was sometimes steep, but always short; the high, bare plains\r\nof Portland resemble great flagstones overlapping each other. The south\r\nside seems to enter under the protruding slab, the north side rises over\r\nthe next one; these made ascents, which the child stepped over nimbly.\r\nFrom time to time he stopped, and seemed to hold counsel with himself.\r\nThe night was becoming very dark. His radius of sight was contracting.\r\nHe now only saw a few steps before him.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden he stopped, listened for an instant, and with an almost\r\nimperceptible nod of satisfaction turned quickly and directed his steps\r\ntowards an eminence of moderate height, which he dimly perceived on his\r\nright, at the point of the plain nearest the cliff. There was on the\r\neminence a shape which in the mist looked like a tree. The child had\r\njust heard a noise in this direction, which was the noise neither of the\r\nwind nor of the sea, nor was it the cry of animals. He thought that some\r\none was there, and in a few strides he was at the foot of the hillock.\r\n\r\nIn truth, some one was there.\r\n\r\nThat which had been indistinct on the top of the eminence was now\r\nvisible. It was something like a great arm thrust straight out of the\r\nground; at the upper extremity of the arm a sort of forefinger,\r\nsupported from beneath, by the thumb, pointed out horizontally; the\r\narm, the thumb, and the forefinger drew a square against the sky. At the\r\npoint of juncture of this peculiar finger and this peculiar thumb there\r\nwas a line, from which hung something black and shapeless. The line\r\nmoving in the wind sounded like a chain. This was the noise the child\r\nhad heard. Seen closely the line was that which the noise indicated, a\r\nchain--a single chain cable.\r\n\r\nBy that mysterious law of amalgamation which throughout nature causes\r\nappearances to exaggerate realities, the place, the hour, the mist, the\r\nmournful sea, the cloudy turmoils on the distant horizon, added to the\r\neffect of this figure, and made it seem enormous.\r\n\r\nThe mass linked to the chain presented the appearance of a scabbard. It\r\nwas swaddled like a child and long like a man. There was a round thing\r\nat its summit, about which the end of the chain was rolled. The scabbard\r\nwas riven asunder at the lower end, and shreds of flesh hung out between\r\nthe rents.\r\n\r\nA feeble breeze stirred the chain, and that which hung to it swayed\r\ngently. The passive mass obeyed the vague motions of space. It was an\r\nobject to inspire indescribable dread. Horror, which disproportions\r\neverything, blurred its dimensions while retaining its shape. It was a\r\ncondensation of darkness, which had a defined form. Night was above and\r\nwithin the spectre; it was a prey of ghastly exaggeration. Twilight and\r\nmoonrise, stars setting behind the cliff, floating things in space, the\r\nclouds, winds from all quarters, had ended by penetrating into the\r\ncomposition of this visible nothing. The species of log hanging in the\r\nwind partook of the impersonality diffused far over sea and sky, and the\r\ndarkness completed this phase of the _thing_ which had once been a man.\r\n\r\nIt was that which is no longer.\r\n\r\nTo be naught but a remainder! Such a thing is beyond the power of\r\nlanguage to express. To exist no more, yet to persist; to be in the\r\nabyss, yet out of it; to reappear above death as if indissoluble--there\r\nis a certain amount of impossibility mixed with such reality. Thence\r\ncomes the inexpressible. This being--was it a being? This black witness\r\nwas a remainder, and an awful remainder--a remainder of what? Of nature\r\nfirst, and then of society. Naught, and yet total.\r\n\r\nThe lawless inclemency of the weather held it at its will; the deep\r\noblivion of solitude environed it; it was given up to unknown chances;\r\nit was without defence against the darkness, which did with it what it\r\nwilled. It was for ever the patient; it submitted; the hurricane (that\r\nghastly conflict of winds) was upon it.\r\n\r\nThe spectre was given over to pillage. It underwent the horrible outrage\r\nof rotting in the open air; it was an outlaw of the tomb. There was no\r\npeace for it even in annihilation: in the summer it fell away into dust,\r\nin the winter into mud. Death should be veiled, the grave should have\r\nits reserve. Here was neither veil nor reserve, but cynically avowed\r\nputrefaction. It is effrontery in death to display its work; it offends\r\nall the calmness of shadow when it does its task outside its laboratory,\r\nthe grave.\r\n\r\nThis dead thing had been stripped. To strip one already\r\nstripped--relentless act! His marrow was no longer in his bones; his\r\nentrails were no longer in his body; his voice no longer in his throat.\r\nA corpse is a pocket which death turns inside out and empties. If he\r\never had a Me, where was the Me? There still, perchance, and this was\r\nfearful to think of. Something wandering about something in chains--can\r\none imagine a more mournful lineament in the darkness?\r\n\r\nRealities exist here below which serve as issues to the unknown, which\r\nseem to facilitate the egress of speculation, and at which hypothesis\r\nsnatches. Conjecture has its _compelle intrare_. In passing by certain\r\nplaces and before certain objects one cannot help stopping--a prey to\r\ndreams into the realms of which the mind enters. In the invisible there\r\nare dark portals ajar. No one could have met this dead man without\r\nmeditating.\r\n\r\nIn the vastness of dispersion he was wearing silently away. He had had\r\nblood which had been drunk, skin which had been eaten, flesh which had\r\nbeen stolen. Nothing had passed him by without taking somewhat from\r\nhim. December had borrowed cold of him; midnight, horror; the iron,\r\nrust; the plague, miasma; the flowers, perfume. His slow disintegration\r\nwas a toll paid to all--a toll of the corpse to the storm, to the rain,\r\nto the dew, to the reptiles, to the birds. All the dark hands of night\r\nhad rifled the dead.\r\n\r\nHe was, indeed, an inexpressibly strange tenant, a tenant of the\r\ndarkness. He was on a plain and on a hill, and _he was not_. He was\r\npalpable, yet vanished. He was a shadow accruing to the night. After the\r\ndisappearance of day into the vast of silent obscurity, he became in\r\nlugubrious accord with all around him. By his mere presence he increased\r\nthe gloom of the tempest and the calm of stars. The unutterable which is\r\nin the desert was condensed in him. Waif of an unknown fate, he\r\ncommingled with all the wild secrets of the night. There was in his\r\nmystery a vague reverberation of all enigmas.\r\n\r\nAbout him life seemed sinking to its lowest depths. Certainty and\r\nconfidence appeared to diminish in his environs. The shiver of the\r\nbrushwood and the grass, a desolate melancholy, an anxiety in which a\r\nconscience seemed to lurk, appropriated with tragic force the whole\r\nlandscape to that black figure suspended by the chain. The presence of a\r\nspectre in the horizon is an aggravation of solitude.\r\n\r\nHe was a Sign. Having unappeasable winds around him, he was implacable.\r\nPerpetual shuddering made him terrible. Fearful to say, he seemed to be\r\na centre in space, with something immense leaning on him. Who can tell?\r\nPerhaps that equity, half seen and set at defiance, which transcends\r\nhuman justice. There was in his unburied continuance the vengeance of\r\nmen and his own vengeance. He was a testimony in the twilight and the\r\nwaste. He was in himself a disquieting substance, since we tremble\r\nbefore the substance which is the ruined habitation of the soul. For\r\ndead matter to trouble us, it must once have been tenanted by spirit. He\r\ndenounced the law of earth to the law of Heaven. Placed there by man, he\r\nthere awaited God. Above him floated, blended with all the vague\r\ndistortions of the cloud and the wave, boundless dreams of shadow.\r\n\r\nWho could tell what sinister mysteries lurked behind this phantom? The\r\nillimitable, circumscribed by naught, nor tree, nor roof, nor passer-by,\r\nwas around the dead man. When the unchangeable broods over us--when\r\nHeaven, the abyss, the life, grave, and eternity appear patent--then it\r\nis we feel that all is inaccessible, all is forbidden, all is sealed.\r\nWhen infinity opens to us, terrible indeed is the closing of the gate\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nSTRUGGLE BETWEEN DEATH AND LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe child was before this thing, dumb, wondering, and with eyes fixed.\r\n\r\nTo a man it would have been a gibbet; to the child it was an apparition.\r\n\r\nWhere a man would have seen a corpse the child saw a spectre.\r\n\r\nBesides, he did not understand.\r\n\r\nThe attractions of the obscure are manifold. There was one on the summit\r\nof that hill. The child took a step, then another; he ascended, wishing\r\nall the while to descend; and approached, wishing all the while to\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nBold, yet trembling, he went close up to survey the spectre.\r\n\r\nWhen he got close under the gibbet, he looked up and examined it.\r\n\r\nThe spectre was tarred; here and there it shone. The child distinguished\r\nthe face. It was coated over with pitch; and this mask, which appeared\r\nviscous and sticky, varied its aspect with the night shadows. The child\r\nsaw the mouth, which was a hole; the nose, which was a hole; the eyes,\r\nwhich were holes. The body was wrapped, and apparently corded up, in\r\ncoarse canvas, soaked in naphtha. The canvas was mouldy and torn. A knee\r\nprotruded through it. A rent disclosed the ribs--partly corpse, partly\r\nskeleton. The face was the colour of earth; slugs, wandering over it,\r\nhad traced across it vague ribbons of silver. The canvas, glued to the\r\nbones, showed in reliefs like the robe of a statue. The skull, cracked\r\nand fractured, gaped like a rotten fruit. The teeth were still human,\r\nfor they retained a laugh. The remains of a cry seemed to murmur in the\r\nopen mouth. There were a few hairs of beard on the cheek. The inclined\r\nhead had an air of attention.\r\n\r\nSome repairs had recently been done; the face had been tarred afresh, as\r\nwell as the ribs and the knee which protruded from the canvas. The feet\r\nhung out below.\r\n\r\nJust underneath, in the grass, were two shoes, which snow and rain had\r\nrendered shapeless. These shoes had fallen from the dead man.\r\n\r\nThe barefooted child looked at the shoes.\r\n\r\nThe wind, which had become more and more restless, was now and then\r\ninterrupted by those pauses which foretell the approach of a storm. For\r\nthe last few minutes it had altogether ceased to blow. The corpse no\r\nlonger stirred; the chain was as motionless as a plumb line.\r\n\r\nLike all newcomers into life, and taking into account the peculiar\r\ninfluences of his fate, the child no doubt felt within him that\r\nawakening of ideas characteristic of early years, which endeavours to\r\nopen the brain, and which resembles the pecking of the young bird in the\r\negg. But all that there was in his little consciousness just then was\r\nresolved into stupor. Excess of sensation has the effect of too much\r\noil, and ends by putting out thought. A man would have put himself\r\nquestions; the child put himself none--he only looked.\r\n\r\nThe tar gave the face a wet appearance; drops of pitch, congealed in\r\nwhat had once been the eyes, produced the effect of tears. However,\r\nthanks to the pitch, the ravage of death, if not annulled, was visibly\r\nslackened and reduced to the least possible decay. That which was before\r\nthe child was a thing of which care was taken: the man was evidently\r\nprecious. They had not cared to keep him alive, but they cared to keep\r\nhim dead.\r\n\r\nThe gibbet was old, worm-eaten, although strong, and had been in use\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nIt was an immemorial custom in England to tar smugglers. They were\r\nhanged on the seaboard, coated over with pitch and left swinging.\r\nExamples must be made in public, and tarred examples last longest. The\r\ntar was mercy: by renewing it they were spared making too many fresh\r\nexamples. They placed gibbets from point to point along the coast, as\r\nnowadays they do beacons. The hanged man did duty as a lantern. After\r\nhis fashion, he guided his comrades, the smugglers. The smugglers from\r\nfar out at sea perceived the gibbets. There is one, first warning;\r\nanother, second warning. It did not stop smuggling; but public order is\r\nmade up of such things. The fashion lasted in England up to the\r\nbeginning of this century. In 1822 three men were still to be seen\r\nhanging in front of Dover Castle. But, for that matter, the preserving\r\nprocess was employed not only with smugglers. England turned robbers,\r\nincendiaries, and murderers to the same account. Jack Painter, who set\r\nfire to the government storehouses at Portsmouth, was hanged and tarred\r\nin 1776. L’Abbé Coyer, who describes him as Jean le Peintre, saw him\r\nagain in 1777. Jack Painter was hanging above the ruin he had made, and\r\nwas re-tarred from time to time. His corpse lasted--I had almost said\r\nlived--nearly fourteen years. It was still doing good service in 1788;\r\nin 1790, however, they were obliged to replace it by another. The\r\nEgyptians used to value the mummy of the king; a plebeian mummy can\r\nalso, it appears, be of service.\r\n\r\nThe wind, having great power on the hill, had swept it of all its snow.\r\nHerbage reappeared on it, interspersed here and there with a few\r\nthistles; the hill was covered by that close short grass which grows by\r\nthe sea, and causes the tops of cliffs to resemble green cloth. Under\r\nthe gibbet, on the very spot over which hung the feet of the executed\r\ncriminal, was a long and thick tuft, uncommon on such poor soil.\r\nCorpses, crumbling there for centuries past, accounted for the beauty of\r\nthe grass. Earth feeds on man.\r\n\r\nA dreary fascination held the child; he remained there open-mouthed. He\r\nonly dropped his head a moment when a nettle, which felt like an insect,\r\nstung his leg; then he looked up again--he looked above him at the face\r\nwhich looked down on him. It appeared to regard him the more steadfastly\r\nbecause it had no eyes. It was a comprehensive glance, having an\r\nindescribable fixedness in which there were both light and darkness, and\r\nwhich emanated from the skull and teeth, as well as the empty arches of\r\nthe brow. The whole head of a dead man seems to have vision, and this is\r\nawful. No eyeball, yet we feel that we are looked at. A horror of worms.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the child himself was becoming an object of terror. He\r\nno longer moved. Torpor was coming over him. He did not perceive that he\r\nwas losing consciousness--he was becoming benumbed and lifeless. Winter\r\nwas silently delivering him over to night. There is something of the\r\ntraitor in winter. The child was all but a statue. The coldness of stone\r\nwas penetrating his bones; darkness, that reptile, was crawling over\r\nhim. The drowsiness resulting from snow creeps over a man like a dim\r\ntide. The child was being slowly invaded by a stagnation resembling that\r\nof the corpse. He was falling asleep.\r\n\r\nOn the hand of sleep is the finger of death. The child felt himself\r\nseized by that hand. He was on the point of falling under the gibbet. He\r\nno longer knew whether he was standing upright.\r\n\r\nThe end always impending, no transition between to be and not to be, the\r\nreturn into the crucible, the slip possible every minute--such is the\r\nprecipice which is Creation.\r\n\r\nAnother instant, the child and the dead, life in sketch and life in\r\nruin, would be confounded in the same obliteration.\r\n\r\nThe spectre appeared to understand, and not to wish it. Of a sudden it\r\nstirred. One would have said it was warning the child. It was the wind\r\nbeginning to blow again. Nothing stranger than this dead man in\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThe corpse at the end of the chain, pushed by the invisible gust, took\r\nan oblique attitude; rose to the left, then fell back, reascended to the\r\nright, and fell and rose with slow and mournful precision. A weird game\r\nof see-saw. It seemed as though one saw in the darkness the pendulum of\r\nthe clock of Eternity.\r\n\r\nThis continued for some time. The child felt himself waking up at the\r\nsight of the dead; through his increasing numbness he experienced a\r\ndistinct sense of fear.\r\n\r\nThe chain at every oscillation made a grinding sound, with hideous\r\nregularity. It appeared to take breath, and then to resume. This\r\ngrinding was like the cry of a grasshopper.\r\n\r\nAn approaching squall is heralded by sudden gusts of wind. All at once\r\nthe breeze increased into a gale. The corpse emphasized its dismal\r\noscillations. It no longer swung, it tossed; the chain, which had been\r\ngrinding, now shrieked. It appeared that its shriek was heard. If it was\r\nan appeal, it was obeyed. From the depths of the horizon came the sound\r\nof a rushing noise.\r\n\r\nIt was the noise of wings.\r\n\r\nAn incident occurred, a stormy incident, peculiar to graveyards and\r\nsolitudes. It was the arrival of a flight of ravens. Black flying specks\r\npricked the clouds, pierced through the mist, increased in size, came\r\nnear, amalgamated, thickened, hastening towards the hill, uttering\r\ncries. It was like the approach of a Legion. The winged vermin of the\r\ndarkness alighted on the gibbet; the child, scared, drew back.\r\n\r\nSwarms obey words of command: the birds crowded on the gibbet; not one\r\nwas on the corpse. They were talking among themselves. The croaking was\r\nfrightful. The howl, the whistle and the roar, are signs of life; the\r\ncroak is a satisfied acceptance of putrefaction. In it you can fancy you\r\nhear the tomb breaking silence. The croak is night-like in itself.\r\n\r\nThe child was frozen even more by terror than by cold.\r\n\r\nThen the ravens held silence. One of them perched on the skeleton. This\r\nwas a signal: they all precipitated themselves upon it. There was a\r\ncloud of wings, then all their feathers closed up, and the hanged man\r\ndisappeared under a swarm of black blisters struggling in the obscurity.\r\nJust then the corpse moved. Was it the corpse? Was it the wind? It made\r\na frightful bound. The hurricane, which was increasing, came to its\r\naid. The phantom fell into convulsions.\r\n\r\nThe squall, already blowing with full lungs, laid hold of it, and moved\r\nit about in all directions.\r\n\r\nIt became horrible; it began to struggle. An awful puppet, with a gibbet\r\nchain for a string. Some humorist of night must have seized the string\r\nand been playing with the mummy. It turned and leapt as if it would fain\r\ndislocate itself; the birds, frightened, flew off. It was like an\r\nexplosion of all those unclean creatures. Then they returned, and a\r\nstruggle began.\r\n\r\nThe dead man seemed possessed with hideous vitality. The winds raised\r\nhim as though they meant to carry him away. He seemed struggling and\r\nmaking efforts to escape, but his iron collar held him back. The birds\r\nadapted themselves to all his movements, retreating, then striking\r\nagain, scared but desperate. On one side a strange flight was attempted,\r\non the other the pursuit of a chained man. The corpse, impelled by every\r\nspasm of the wind, had shocks, starts, fits of rage: it went, it came,\r\nit rose, it fell, driving back the scattered swarm. The dead man was a\r\nclub, the swarms were dust. The fierce, assailing flock would not leave\r\ntheir hold, and grew stubborn; the man, as if maddened by the cluster of\r\nbeaks, redoubled his blind chastisement of space. It was like the blows\r\nof a stone held in a sling. At times the corpse was covered by talons\r\nand wings; then it was free. There were disappearances of the horde,\r\nthen sudden furious returns--a frightful torment continuing after life\r\nwas past. The birds seemed frenzied. The air-holes of hell must surely\r\ngive passage to such swarms. Thrusting of claws, thrusting of beaks,\r\ncroakings, rendings of shreds no longer flesh, creakings of the gibbet,\r\nshudderings of the skeleton, jingling of the chain, the voices of the\r\nstorm and tumult--what conflict more fearful? A hobgoblin warring with\r\ndevils! A combat with a spectre!\r\n\r\nAt times the storm redoubling its violence, the hanged man revolved on\r\nhis own pivot, turning every way at once towards the swarm, as if he\r\nwished to run after the birds; his teeth seemed to try and bite them.\r\nThe wind was for him, the chain against him. It was as if black deities\r\nwere mixing themselves up in the fray. The hurricane was in the battle.\r\nAs the dead man turned himself about, the flock of birds wound round him\r\nspirally. It was a whirl in a whirlwind. A great roar was heard from\r\nbelow. It was the sea.\r\n\r\nThe child saw this nightmare. Suddenly he trembled in all his limbs; a\r\nshiver thrilled his frame; he staggered, tottered, nearly fell,\r\nrecovered himself, pressed both hands to his forehead, as if he felt his\r\nforehead a support; then, haggard, his hair streaming in the wind,\r\ndescending the hill with long strides, his eyes closed, himself almost a\r\nphantom, he took flight, leaving behind that torment in the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE NORTH POINT OF PORTLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe ran until he was breathless, at random, desperate, over the plain\r\ninto the snow, into space. His flight warmed him. He needed it. Without\r\nthe run and the fright he had died.\r\n\r\nWhen his breath failed him he stopped, but he dared not look back. He\r\nfancied that the birds would pursue him, that the dead man had undone\r\nhis chain and was perhaps hurrying behind him, and no doubt the gibbet\r\nitself was descending the hill, running after the dead man; he feared to\r\nsee these things if he turned his head.\r\n\r\nWhen he had somewhat recovered his breath he resumed his flight.\r\n\r\nTo account for facts does not belong to childhood. He received\r\nimpressions which were magnified by terror, but he did not link them\r\ntogether in his mind, nor form any conclusion on them. He was going on,\r\nno matter how or where; he ran in agony and difficulty as one in a\r\ndream. During the three hours or so since he had been deserted, his\r\nonward progress, still vague, had changed its purpose. At first it was a\r\nsearch; now it was a flight. He no longer felt hunger nor cold--he felt\r\nfear. One instinct had given place to another. To escape was now his\r\nwhole thought--to escape from what? From everything. On all sides life\r\nseemed to enclose him like a horrible wall. If he could have fled from\r\nall things, he would have done so. But children know nothing of that\r\nbreaking from prison which is called suicide. He was running. He ran on\r\nfor an indefinite time; but fear dies with lack of breath.\r\n\r\nAll at once, as if seized by a sudden accession of energy and\r\nintelligence, he stopped. One would have said he was ashamed of running\r\naway. He drew himself up, stamped his foot, and, with head erect, looked\r\nround. There was no longer hill, nor gibbet, nor flights of crows. The\r\nfog had resumed possession of the horizon. The child pursued his way: he\r\nnow no longer ran but walked. To say that meeting with a corpse had made\r\na man of him would be to limit the manifold and confused impression\r\nwhich possessed him. There was in his impression much more and much\r\nless. The gibbet, a mighty trouble in the rudiment of comprehension,\r\nnascent in his mind, still seemed to him an apparition; but a trouble\r\novercome is strength gained, and he felt himself stronger. Had he been\r\nof an age to probe self, he would have detected within him a thousand\r\nother germs of meditation; but the reflection of children is shapeless,\r\nand the utmost they feel is the bitter aftertaste of that which, obscure\r\nto them, the man later on calls indignation. Let us add that a child has\r\nthe faculty of quickly accepting the conclusion of a sensation; the\r\ndistant fading boundaries which amplify painful subjects escape him. A\r\nchild is protected by the limit of feebleness against emotions which are\r\ntoo complex. He sees the fact, and little else beside. The difficulty of\r\nbeing satisfied by half-ideas does not exist for him. It is not until\r\nlater that experience comes, with its brief, to conduct the lawsuit of\r\nlife. _Then_ he confronts groups of facts which have crossed his path;\r\nthe understanding, cultivated and enlarged, draws comparisons; the\r\nmemories of youth reappear under the passions, like the traces of a\r\npalimpsest under the erasure; these memories form the bases of logic,\r\nand that which was a vision in the child’s brain becomes a syllogism in\r\nthe man’s. Experience is, however, various, and turns to good or evil\r\naccording to natural disposition. With the good it ripens, with the bad\r\nit rots.\r\n\r\nThe child had run quite a quarter of a league, and walked another\r\nquarter, when suddenly he felt the craving of hunger. A thought which\r\naltogether eclipsed the hideous apparition on the hill occurred to him\r\nforcibly--that he must eat. Happily there is in man a brute which serves\r\nto lead him back to reality.\r\n\r\nBut what to eat, where to eat, how to eat?\r\n\r\nHe felt his pockets mechanically, well knowing that they were empty.\r\nThen he quickened his steps, without knowing whither he was going. He\r\nhastened towards a possible shelter. This faith in an inn is one of the\r\nconvictions enrooted by God in man. To believe in a shelter is to\r\nbelieve in God.\r\n\r\nHowever, in that plain of snow there was nothing like a roof. The child\r\nwent on, and the waste continued bare as far as eye could see. There had\r\nnever been a human habitation on the tableland. It was at the foot of\r\nthe cliff, in holes in the rocks, that, lacking wood to build themselves\r\nhuts, had dwelt long ago the aboriginal inhabitants, who had slings for\r\narms, dried cow-dung for firing, for a god the idol Heil standing in a\r\nglade at Dorchester, and for trade the fishing of that false gray coral\r\nwhich the Gauls called _plin_, and the Greeks _isidis plocamos_.\r\n\r\nThe child found his way as best he could. Destiny is made up of\r\ncross-roads. An option of path is dangerous. This little being had an\r\nearly choice of doubtful chances.\r\n\r\nHe continued to advance, but although the muscles of his thighs seemed\r\nto be of steel, he began to tire. There were no tracks in the plain; or\r\nif there were any, the snow had obliterated them. Instinctively he\r\ninclined eastwards. Sharp stones had wounded his heels. Had it been\r\ndaylight pink stains made by his blood might have been seen in the\r\nfootprints he left in the snow.\r\n\r\nHe recognized nothing. He was crossing the plain of Portland from south\r\nto north, and it is probable that the band with which he had come, to\r\navoid meeting any one, had crossed it from east to west; they had most\r\nlikely sailed in some fisherman’s or smuggler’s boat, from a point on\r\nthe coast of Uggescombe, such as St. Catherine’s Cape or Swancry, to\r\nPortland to find the hooker which awaited them; and they must have\r\nlanded in one of the creeks of Weston, and re-embarked in one of those\r\nof Easton. That direction was intersected by the one the child was now\r\nfollowing. It was impossible for him to recognize the road.\r\n\r\nOn the plain of Portland there are, here and there, raised strips of\r\nland, abruptly ended by the shore and cut perpendicular to the sea. The\r\nwandering child reached one of these culminating points and stopped on\r\nit, hoping that a larger space might reveal further indications. He\r\ntried to see around him. Before him, in place of a horizon, was a vast\r\nlivid opacity. He looked at this attentively, and under the fixedness of\r\nhis glance it became less indistinct. At the base of a distant fold of\r\nland towards the east, in the depths of that opaque lividity (a moving\r\nand wan sort of precipice, which resembled a cliff of the night), crept\r\nand floated some vague black rents, some dim shreds of vapour. The pale\r\nopacity was fog, the black shreds were smoke. Where there is smoke there\r\nare men. The child turned his steps in that direction.\r\n\r\nHe saw some distance off a descent, and at the foot of the descent,\r\namong shapeless conformations of rock, blurred by the mist, what seemed\r\nto be either a sandbank or a tongue of land, joining probably to the\r\nplains of the horizon the tableland he had just crossed. It was evident\r\nhe must pass that way.\r\n\r\nHe had, in fact, arrived at the Isthmus of Portland, a diluvian alluvium\r\nwhich is called Chess Hill.\r\n\r\nHe began to descend the side of the plateau.\r\n\r\nThe descent was difficult and rough. It was (with less of ruggedness,\r\nhowever) the reverse of the ascent he had made on leaving the creek.\r\nEvery ascent is balanced by a decline. After having clambered up he\r\ncrawled down.\r\n\r\nHe leapt from one rock to another at the risk of a sprain, at the risk\r\nof falling into the vague depths below. To save himself when he slipped\r\non the rock or on the ice, he caught hold of handfuls of weeds and\r\nfurze, thick with thorns, and their points ran into his fingers. At\r\ntimes he came on an easier declivity, taking breath as he descended;\r\nthen came on the precipice again, and each step necessitated an\r\nexpedient. In descending precipices, every movement solves a problem.\r\nOne must be skilful under pain of death. These problems the child solved\r\nwith an instinct which would have made him the admiration of apes and\r\nmountebanks. The descent was steep and long. Nevertheless he was coming\r\nto the end of it.\r\n\r\nLittle by little it was drawing nearer the moment when he should land on\r\nthe Isthmus, of which from time to time he caught a glimpse. At\r\nintervals, while he bounded or dropped from rock to rock, he pricked up\r\nhis ears, his head erect, like a listening deer. He was hearkening to a\r\ndiffused and faint uproar, far away to the left, like the deep note of a\r\nclarion. It was a commotion of winds, preceding that fearful north blast\r\nwhich is heard rushing from the pole, like an inroad of trumpets. At the\r\nsame time the child felt now and then on his brow, on his eyes, on his\r\ncheeks, something which was like the palms of cold hands being placed on\r\nhis face. These were large frozen flakes, sown at first softly in space,\r\nthen eddying, and heralding a snowstorm. The child was covered with\r\nthem. The snowstorm, which for the last hour had been on the sea, was\r\nbeginning to gain the land. It was slowly invading the plains. It was\r\nentering obliquely, by the north-west, the tableland of Portland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE SECOND.\r\n\r\n_THE HOOKER AT SEA_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nSUPERHUMAN LAWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe snowstorm is one of the mysteries of the ocean. It is the most\r\nobscure of things meteorological--obscure in every sense of the word. It\r\nis a mixture of fog and storm; and even in our days we cannot well\r\naccount for the phenomenon. Hence many disasters.\r\n\r\nWe try to explain all things by the action of wind and wave; yet in the\r\nair there is a force which is not the wind, and in the waters a force\r\nwhich is not the wave. That force, both in the air and in the water, is\r\neffluvium. Air and water are two nearly identical liquid masses,\r\nentering into the composition of each other by condensation and\r\ndilatation, so that to breathe is to drink. Effluvium alone is fluid.\r\nThe wind and the wave are only impulses; effluvium is a current. The\r\nwind is visible in clouds, the wave is visible in foam; effluvium is\r\ninvisible. From time to time, however, it says, “I am here.” Its “I am\r\nhere” is a clap of thunder.\r\n\r\nThe snowstorm offers a problem analogous to the dry fog. If the solution\r\nof the _callina_ of the Spaniards and the _quobar_ of the Ethiopians be\r\npossible, assuredly that solution will be achieved by attentive\r\nobservation of magnetic effluvium.\r\n\r\nWithout effluvium a crowd of circumstances would remain enigmatic.\r\nStrictly speaking, the changes in the velocity of the wind, varying\r\nfrom 3 feet per second to 220 feet, would supply a reason for the\r\nvariations of the waves rising from 3 inches in a calm sea to 36 feet in\r\na raging one. Strictly speaking, the horizontal direction of the winds,\r\neven in a squall, enables us to understand how it is that a wave 30 feet\r\nhigh can be 1,500 feet long. But why are the waves of the Pacific four\r\ntimes higher near America than near Asia; that is to say, higher in the\r\nEast than in the West? Why is the contrary true of the Atlantic? Why,\r\nunder the Equator, are they highest in the middle of the sea? Wherefore\r\nthese deviations in the swell of the ocean? This is what magnetic\r\neffluvium, combined with terrestrial rotation and sidereal attraction,\r\ncan alone explain.\r\n\r\nIs not this mysterious complication needed to explain an oscillation of\r\nthe wind veering, for instance, by the west from south-east to\r\nnorth-east, then suddenly returning in the same great curve from\r\nnorth-east to south-east, so as to make in thirty-six hours a prodigious\r\ncircuit of 560 degrees? Such was the preface to the snowstorm of March\r\n17, 1867.\r\n\r\nThe storm-waves of Australia reach a height of 80 feet; this fact is\r\nconnected with the vicinity of the Pole. Storms in those latitudes\r\nresult less from disorder of the winds than from submarine electrical\r\ndischarges. In the year 1866 the transatlantic cable was disturbed at\r\nregular intervals in its working for two hours in the twenty-four--from\r\nnoon to two o’clock--by a sort of intermittent fever. Certain\r\ncompositions and decompositions of forces produce phenomena, and impose\r\nthemselves on the calculations of the seaman under pain of shipwreck.\r\nThe day that navigation, now a routine, shall become a mathematic; the\r\nday we shall, for instance, seek to know why it is that in our regions\r\nhot winds come sometimes from the north, and cold winds from the south;\r\nthe day we shall understand that diminutions of temperature are\r\nproportionate to oceanic depths; the day we realize that the globe is a\r\nvast loadstone polarized in immensity, with two axes--an axis of\r\nrotation and an axis of effluvium--intersecting each other at the centre\r\nof the earth, and that the magnetic poles turn round the geographical\r\npoles; when those who risk life will choose to risk it scientifically;\r\nwhen men shall navigate assured from studied uncertainty; when the\r\ncaptain shall be a meteorologist; when the pilot shall be a chemist;\r\nthen will many catastrophes be avoided. The sea is magnetic as much as\r\naquatic: an ocean of unknown forces floats in the ocean of the waves,\r\nor, one might say, on the surface. Only to behold in the sea a mass of\r\nwater is not to see it at all: the sea is an ebb and flow of fluid, as\r\nmuch as a flux and reflux of liquid. It is, perhaps, complicated by\r\nattractions even more than by hurricanes; molecular adhesion, manifested\r\namong other phenomena by capillary attraction, although microscopic,\r\ntakes in ocean its place in the grandeur of immensity; and the wave of\r\neffluvium sometimes aids, sometimes counteracts, the wave of the air and\r\nthe wave of the waters. He who is ignorant of electric law is ignorant\r\nof hydraulic law; for the one intermixes with the other. It is true\r\nthere is no study more difficult nor more obscure; it verges on\r\nempiricism, just as astronomy verges on astrology; and yet without this\r\nstudy there is no navigation. Having said this much we will pass on.\r\n\r\nOne of the most dangerous components of the sea is the snowstorm. The\r\nsnowstorm is above all things magnetic. The pole produces it as it\r\nproduces the aurora borealis. It is in the fog of the one as in the\r\nlight of the other; and in the flake of snow as in the streak of flame\r\neffluvium is visible.\r\n\r\nStorms are the nervous attacks and delirious frenzies of the sea. The\r\nsea has its ailments. Tempests may be compared to maladies. Some are\r\nmortal, others not; some may be escaped, others not. The snowstorm is\r\nsupposed to be generally mortal. Jarabija, one of the pilots of\r\nMagellan, termed it “a cloud issuing from the devil’s sore side.”[2]\r\n\r\nThe old Spanish navigators called this kind of squall _la nevada_, when\r\nit came with snow; _la helada_, when it came with hail. According to\r\nthem, bats fell from the sky, with the snow.\r\n\r\nSnowstorms are characteristic of polar latitudes; nevertheless, at times\r\nthey glide--one might almost say tumble--into our climates; so much\r\nruin is mingled with the chances of the air.\r\n\r\nThe _Matutina_, as we have seen, plunged resolutely into the great\r\nhazard of the night, a hazard increased by the impending storm. She had\r\nencountered its menace with a sort of tragic audacity; nevertheless, it\r\nmust be remembered that she had received due warning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOUR FIRST ROUGH SKETCHES FILLED IN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the hooker was in the gulf of Portland, there was but little sea\r\non; the ocean, if gloomy, was almost still, and the sky was yet clear.\r\nThe wind took little effect on the vessel; the hooker hugged the cliff\r\nas closely as possible; it served as a screen to her.\r\n\r\nThere were ten on board the little Biscayan felucca--three men in crew,\r\nand seven passengers, of whom two were women. In the light of the open\r\nsea (which broadens twilight into day) all the figures on board were\r\nclearly visible. Besides they were not hiding now--they were all at\r\nease; each one reassumed his freedom of manner, spoke in his own note,\r\nshowed his face; departure was to them a deliverance.\r\n\r\nThe motley nature of the group shone out. The women were of no age. A\r\nwandering life produces premature old age, and indigence is made up of\r\nwrinkles. One of them was a Basque of the Dry-ports. The other, with the\r\nlarge rosary, was an Irishwoman. They wore that air of indifference\r\ncommon to the wretched. They had squatted down close to each other when\r\nthey got on board, on chests at the foot of the mast. They talked to\r\neach other. Irish and Basque are, as we have said, kindred languages.\r\nThe Basque woman’s hair was scented with onions and basil. The skipper\r\nof the hooker was a Basque of Guipuzcoa. One sailor was a Basque of the\r\nnorthern slope of the Pyrenees, the other was of the southern\r\nslope--that is to say, they were of the same nation, although the first\r\nwas French and the latter Spanish. The Basques recognize no official\r\ncountry. _Mi madre se llama Montaña_, my mother is called the mountain,\r\nas Zalareus, the muleteer, used to say. Of the five men who were with\r\nthe two women, one was a Frenchman of Languedoc, one a Frenchman of\r\nProvence, one a Genoese; one, an old man, he who wore the sombrero\r\nwithout a hole for a pipe, appeared to be a German. The fifth, the\r\nchief, was a Basque of the Landes from Biscarrosse. It was he who, just\r\nas the child was going on board the hooker, had, with a kick of his\r\nheel, cast the plank into the sea. This man, robust, agile, sudden in\r\nmovement, covered, as may be remembered, with trimmings, slashings, and\r\nglistening tinsel, could not keep in his place; he stooped down, rose\r\nup, and continually passed to and fro from one end of the vessel to the\r\nother, as if debating uneasily on what had been done and what was going\r\nto happen.\r\n\r\nThis chief of the band, the captain and the two men of the crew, all\r\nfour Basques, spoke sometimes Basque, sometimes Spanish, sometimes\r\nFrench--these three languages being common on both slopes of the\r\nPyrenees. But generally speaking, excepting the women, all talked\r\nsomething like French, which was the foundation of their slang. The\r\nFrench language about this period began to be chosen by the peoples as\r\nsomething intermediate between the excess of consonants in the north and\r\nthe excess of vowels in the south. In Europe, French was the language of\r\ncommerce, and also of felony. It will be remembered that Gibby, a London\r\nthief, understood Cartouche.\r\n\r\nThe hooker, a fine sailer, was making quick way; still, ten persons,\r\nbesides their baggage, were a heavy cargo for one of such light draught.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the vessel’s aiding the escape of a band did not necessarily\r\nimply that the crew were accomplices. It was sufficient that the captain\r\nof the vessel was a Vascongado, and that the chief of the band was\r\nanother. Among that race mutual assistance is a duty which admits of no\r\nexception. A Basque, as we have said, is neither Spanish nor French; he\r\nis Basque, and always and everywhere he must succour a Basque. Such is\r\nPyrenean fraternity.\r\n\r\nAll the time the hooker was in the gulf, the sky, although threatening,\r\ndid not frown enough to cause the fugitives any uneasiness. They were\r\nflying, they were escaping, they were brutally gay. One laughed, another\r\nsang; the laugh was dry but free, the song was low but careless.\r\n\r\nThe Languedocian cried, “_Caoucagno!_” “_Cocagne_” expresses the highest\r\npitch of satisfaction in Narbonne. He was a longshore sailor, a native\r\nof the waterside village of Gruissan, on the southern side of the\r\nClappe, a bargeman rather than a mariner, but accustomed to work the\r\nreaches of the inlet of Bages, and to draw the drag-net full of fish\r\nover the salt sands of St. Lucie. He was of the race who wear a red cap,\r\nmake complicated signs of the cross after the Spanish fashion, drink\r\nwine out of goat-skins, eat scraped ham, kneel down to blaspheme, and\r\nimplore their patron saint with threats--“Great saint, grant me what I\r\nask, or I’ll throw a stone at thy head, _ou té feg un pic_.” He might\r\nbe, at need, a useful addition to the crew.\r\n\r\nThe Provençal in the caboose was blowing up a turf fire under an\r\niron pot, and making broth. The broth was a kind of puchero, in which\r\nfish took the place of meat, and into which the Provençal threw\r\nchick peas, little bits of bacon cut in squares, and pods of red\r\npimento--concessions made by the eaters of _bouillabaisse_ to the\r\neaters of _olla podrida_. One of the bags of provisions was beside him\r\nunpacked. He had lighted over his head an iron lantern, glazed with\r\ntalc, which swung on a hook from the ceiling. By its side, on another\r\nhook, swung the weather-cock halcyon. There was a popular belief in\r\nthose days that a dead halcyon, hung by the beak, always turned its\r\nbreast to the quarter whence the wind was blowing. While he made the\r\nbroth, the Provençal put the neck of a gourd into his mouth, and now and\r\nthen swallowed a draught of aguardiente. It was one of those gourds\r\ncovered with wicker, broad and flat, with handles, which used to be hung\r\nto the side by a strap, and which were then called hip-gourds. Between\r\neach gulp he mumbled one of those country songs of which the subject is\r\nnothing at all: a hollow road, a hedge; you see in the meadow, through a\r\ngap in the bushes, the shadow of a horse and cart, elongated in the\r\nsunset, and from time to time, above the hedge, the end of a fork loaded\r\nwith hay appears and disappears--you want no more to make a song.\r\n\r\nA departure, according to the bent of one’s mind, is a relief or a\r\ndepression. All seemed lighter in spirits excepting the old man of the\r\nband, the man with the hat that had no pipe.\r\n\r\nThis old man, who looked more German than anything else, although he had\r\none of those unfathomable faces in which nationality is lost, was bald,\r\nand so grave that his baldness might have been a tonsure. Every time he\r\npassed before the Virgin on the prow, he raised his felt hat, so that\r\nyou could see the swollen and senile veins of his skull. A sort of full\r\ngown, torn and threadbare, of brown Dorchester serge, but half hid his\r\nclosely fitting coat, tight, compact, and hooked up to the neck like a\r\ncassock. His hands inclined to cross each other, and had the mechanical\r\njunction of habitual prayer. He had what might be called a wan\r\ncountenance; for the countenance is above all things a reflection, and\r\nit is an error to believe that idea is colourless. That countenance was\r\nevidently the surface of a strange inner state, the result of a\r\ncomposition of contradictions, some tending to drift away in good,\r\nothers in evil, and to an observer it was the revelation of one who was\r\nless and more than human--capable of falling below the scale of the\r\ntiger, or of rising above that of man. Such chaotic souls exist. There\r\nwas something inscrutable in that face. Its secret reached the abstract.\r\nYou felt that the man had known the foretaste of evil which is the\r\ncalculation, and the after-taste which is the zero. In his\r\nimpassibility, which was perhaps only on the surface, were imprinted two\r\npetrifactions--the petrifaction of the heart proper to the hangman, and\r\nthe petrifaction of the mind proper to the mandarin. One might have said\r\n(for the monstrous has its mode of being complete) that all things were\r\npossible to him, even emotion. In every savant there is something of the\r\ncorpse, and this man was a savant. Only to see him you caught science\r\nimprinted in the gestures of his body and in the folds of his dress. His\r\nwas a fossil face, the serious cast of which was counteracted by that\r\nwrinkled mobility of the polyglot which verges on grimace. But a severe\r\nman withal; nothing of the hypocrite, nothing of the cynic. A tragic\r\ndreamer. He was one of those whom crime leaves pensive; he had the brow\r\nof an incendiary tempered by the eyes of an archbishop. His sparse gray\r\nlocks turned to white over his temples. The Christian was evident in\r\nhim, complicated with the fatalism of the Turk. Chalkstones deformed his\r\nfingers, dissected by leanness. The stiffness of his tall frame was\r\ngrotesque. He had his sea-legs, he walked slowly about the deck, not\r\nlooking at any one, with an air decided and sinister. His eyeballs were\r\nvaguely filled with the fixed light of a soul studious of the darkness\r\nand afflicted by reapparitions of conscience.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the chief of the band, abrupt and alert, and making\r\nsudden turns about the vessel, came to him and whispered in his ear. The\r\nold man answered by a nod. It might have been the lightning consulting\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTROUBLED MEN ON THE TROUBLED SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo men on board the craft were absorbed in thought--the old man, and\r\nthe skipper of the hooker, who must not be mistaken for the chief of the\r\nband. The captain was occupied by the sea, the old man by the sky. The\r\nformer did not lift his eyes from the waters; the latter kept watch on\r\nthe firmament. The skipper’s anxiety was the state of the sea; the old\r\nman seemed to suspect the heavens. He scanned the stars through every\r\nbreak in the clouds.\r\n\r\nIt was the time when day still lingers, but some few stars begin faintly\r\nto pierce the twilight. The horizon was singular. The mist upon it\r\nvaried. Haze predominated on land, clouds at sea.\r\n\r\nThe skipper, noting the rising billows, hauled all taut before he got\r\noutside Portland Bay. He would not delay so doing until he should pass\r\nthe headland. He examined the rigging closely, and satisfied himself\r\nthat the lower shrouds were well set up, and supported firmly the\r\nfuttock-shrouds--precautions of a man who means to carry on with a press\r\nof sail, at all risks.\r\n\r\nThe hooker was not trimmed, being two feet by the head. This was her\r\nweak point.\r\n\r\nThe captain passed every minute from the binnacle to the standard\r\ncompass, taking the bearings of objects on shore. The _Matutina_ had at\r\nfirst a soldier’s wind which was not unfavourable, though she could not\r\nlie within five points of her course. The captain took the helm as often\r\nas possible, trusting no one but himself to prevent her from dropping to\r\nleeward, the effect of the rudder being influenced by the steerage-way.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the true and apparent course being relative to\r\nthe way on the vessel, the hooker seemed to lie closer to the wind than\r\nshe did in reality. The breeze was not a-beam, nor was the hooker\r\nclose-hauled; but one cannot ascertain the true course made, except when\r\nthe wind is abaft. When you perceive long streaks of clouds meeting in a\r\npoint on the horizon, you may be sure that the wind is in that quarter;\r\nbut this evening the wind was variable; the needle fluctuated; the\r\ncaptain distrusted the erratic movements of the vessel. He steered\r\ncarefully but resolutely, luffed her up, watched her coming to,\r\nprevented her from yawing, and from running into the wind’s eye: noted\r\nthe leeway, the little jerks of the helm: was observant of every roll\r\nand pitch of the vessel, of the difference in her speed, and of the\r\nvariable gusts of wind. For fear of accidents, he was constantly on the\r\nlookout for squalls from off the land he was hugging, and above all he\r\nwas cautious to keep her full; the direction of the breeze indicated by\r\nthe compass being uncertain from the small size of the instrument. The\r\ncaptain’s eyes, frequently lowered, remarked every change in the waves.\r\n\r\nOnce nevertheless he raised them towards the sky, and tried to make out\r\nthe three stars of Orion’s belt. These stars are called the three magi,\r\nand an old proverb of the ancient Spanish pilots declares that, “He who\r\nsees the three magi is not far from the Saviour.”\r\n\r\nThis glance of the captain’s tallied with an aside growled out, at the\r\nother end of the vessel, by the old man, “We don’t even see the\r\npointers, nor the star Antares, red as he is. Not one is distinct.”\r\n\r\nNo care troubled the other fugitives.\r\n\r\nStill, when the first hilarity they felt in their escape had passed\r\naway, they could not help remembering that they were at sea in the month\r\nof January, and that the wind was frozen. It was impossible to establish\r\nthemselves in the cabin. It was much too narrow and too much encumbered\r\nby bales and baggage. The baggage belonged to the passengers, the bales\r\nto the crew, for the hooker was no pleasure boat, and was engaged in\r\nsmuggling. The passengers were obliged to settle themselves on deck, a\r\ncondition to which these wanderers easily resigned themselves. Open-air\r\nhabits make it simple for vagabonds to arrange themselves for the night.\r\nThe open air (_la belle étoile_) is their friend, and the cold helps\r\nthem to sleep--sometimes to die.\r\n\r\nThis night, as we have seen, there was no _belle étoile_.\r\n\r\nThe Languedocian and the Genoese, while waiting for supper, rolled\r\nthemselves up near the women, at the foot of the mast, in some tarpaulin\r\nwhich the sailors had thrown them.\r\n\r\nThe old man remained at the bow motionless, and apparently insensible to\r\nthe cold.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the hooker, from the helm where he was standing, uttered\r\na sort of guttural call somewhat like the cry of the American bird\r\ncalled the exclaimer; at his call the chief of the brand drew near, and\r\nthe captain addressed him thus,--\r\n\r\n“Etcheco Jaüna.” These two words, which mean “tiller of the mountain,”\r\nform with the old Cantabri a solemn preface to any subject which should\r\ncommand attention.\r\n\r\nThen the captain pointed the old man out to the chief, and the dialogue\r\ncontinued in Spanish; it was not, indeed, a very correct dialect, being\r\nthat of the mountains. Here are the questions and answers.\r\n\r\n“Etcheco jaüna, que es este hombre?”\r\n\r\n“Un hombre.”\r\n\r\n“Que lenguas habla?”\r\n\r\n“Todas.”\r\n\r\n“Que cosas sabe?”\r\n\r\n“Todas.”\r\n\r\n“Quai païs?”\r\n\r\n“Ningun, y todos.”\r\n\r\n“Qual dios?”\r\n\r\n“Dios.”\r\n\r\n“Como le llamas?”\r\n\r\n“El tonto.”\r\n\r\n“Como dices que le llamas?”\r\n\r\n“El sabio.”\r\n\r\n“En vuestre tropa que esta?”\r\n\r\n“Esta lo que esta.”\r\n\r\n“El gefe?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Pues que esta?”\r\n\r\n“La alma.”[3]\r\n\r\nThe chief and the captain parted, each reverting to his own meditation,\r\nand a little while afterwards the _Matutina_ left the gulf.\r\n\r\nNow came the great rolling of the open sea. The ocean in the spaces\r\nbetween the foam was slimy in appearance. The waves, seen through the\r\ntwilight in indistinct outline, somewhat resembled plashes of gall. Here\r\nand there a wave floating flat showed cracks and stars, like a pane of\r\nglass broken by stones; in the centre of these stars, in a revolving\r\norifice, trembled a phosphorescence, like that feline reflection, of\r\nvanished light which shines in the eyeballs of owls.\r\n\r\nProudly, like a bold swimmer, the _Matutina_ crossed the dangerous\r\nShambles shoal. This bank, a hidden obstruction at the entrance of\r\nPortland roads, is not a barrier; it is an amphitheatre--a circus of\r\nsand under the sea, its benches cut out by the circling of the waves--an\r\narena, round and symmetrical, as high as a Jungfrau, only drowned--a\r\ncoliseum of the ocean, seen by the diver in the vision-like transparency\r\nwhich engulfs him,--such is the Shambles shoal. There hydras fight,\r\nleviathans meet. There, says the legend, at the bottom of the gigantic\r\nshaft, are the wrecks of ships, seized and sunk by the huge spider\r\nKraken, also called the fish-mountain. Such things lie in the fearful\r\nshadow of the sea.\r\n\r\nThese spectral realities, unknown to man, are manifested at the surface\r\nby a slight shiver.\r\n\r\nIn this nineteenth century, the Shambles bank is in ruins; the\r\nbreakwater recently constructed has overthrown and mutilated, by the\r\nforce of its surf, that high submarine architecture, just as the jetty,\r\nbuilt at the Croisic in 1760, changed, by a quarter of an hour, the\r\ncourse of the tides. And yet the tide is eternal. But eternity obeys man\r\nmore than man imagines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nA CLOUD DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS ENTERS ON THE SCENE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old man whom the chief of the band had named first the Madman, then\r\nthe Sage, now never left the forecastle. Since they crossed the Shambles\r\nshoal, his attention had been divided between the heavens and the\r\nwaters. He looked down, he looked upwards, and above all watched the\r\nnorth-east.\r\n\r\nThe skipper gave the helm to a sailor, stepped over the after hatchway,\r\ncrossed the gangway, and went on to the forecastle. He approached the\r\nold man, but not in front. He stood a little behind, with elbows resting\r\non his hips, with outstretched hands, the head on one side, with open\r\neyes and arched eyebrows, and a smile in the corners of his mouth--an\r\nattitude of curiosity hesitating between mockery and respect.\r\n\r\nThe old man, either that it was his habit to talk to himself, or that\r\nhearing some one behind incited him to speech, began to soliloquize\r\nwhile he looked into space.\r\n\r\n“The meridian, from which the right ascension is calculated, is marked\r\nin this century by four stars--the Polar, Cassiopeia’s Chair,\r\nAndromeda’s Head, and the star Algenib, which is in Pegasus. But there\r\nis not one visible.”\r\n\r\nThese words followed each other mechanically, confused, and scarcely\r\narticulated, as if he did not care to pronounce them. They floated out\r\nof his mouth and dispersed. Soliloquy is the smoke exhaled by the inmost\r\nfires of the soul.\r\n\r\nThe skipper broke in, “My lord!”\r\n\r\nThe old man, perhaps rather deaf as well as very thoughtful, went on,--\r\n\r\n“Too few stars, and too much wind. The breeze continually changes its\r\ndirection and blows inshore; thence it rises perpendicularly. This\r\nresults from the land being warmer than the water. Its atmosphere is\r\nlighter. The cold and dense wind of the sea rushes in to replace it.\r\nFrom this cause, in the upper regions the wind blows towards the land\r\nfrom every quarter. It would be advisable to make long tacks between the\r\ntrue and apparent parallel. When the latitude by observation differs\r\nfrom the latitude by dead reckoning by not more than three minutes in\r\nthirty miles, or by four minutes in sixty miles, you are in the true\r\ncourse.”\r\n\r\nThe skipper bowed, but the old man saw him not. The latter, who wore\r\nwhat resembled an Oxford or Gottingen university gown, did not relax his\r\nhaughty and rigid attitude. He observed the waters as a critic of waves\r\nand of men. He studied the billows, but almost as if he was about to\r\ndemand his turn to speak amidst their turmoil, and teach them something.\r\nThere was in him both pedagogue and soothsayer. He seemed an oracle of\r\nthe deep.\r\n\r\nHe continued his soliloquy, which was perhaps intended to be heard.\r\n\r\n“We might strive if we had a wheel instead of a helm. With a speed of\r\ntwelve miles an hour, a force of twenty pounds exerted on the wheel\r\nproduces three hundred thousand pounds’ effect on the course. And more\r\ntoo. For in some cases, with a double block and runner, they can get two\r\nmore revolutions.”\r\n\r\nThe skipper bowed a second time, and said, “My lord!”\r\n\r\nThe old man’s eye rested on him; he had turned his head without moving\r\nhis body.\r\n\r\n“Call me Doctor.”\r\n\r\n“Master Doctor, I am the skipper.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” said the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, as henceforward we shall call him, appeared willing to\r\nconverse.\r\n\r\n“Skipper, have you an English sextant?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Without an English sextant you cannot take an altitude at all.”\r\n\r\n“The Basques,” replied the captain, “took altitudes before there were\r\nany English.”\r\n\r\n“Be careful you are not taken aback.”\r\n\r\n“I keep her away when necessary.”\r\n\r\n“Have you tried how many knots she is running?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“Just now.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“By the log.”\r\n\r\n“Did you take the trouble to look at the triangle?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Did the sand run through the glass in exactly thirty seconds?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure that the sand has not worn the hole between the globes?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Have you proved the sand-glass by the oscillations of a bullet?”\r\n\r\n“Suspended by a rope yarn drawn out from the top of a coil of soaked\r\nhemp? Undoubtedly.”\r\n\r\n“Have you waxed the yarn lest it should stretch?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Have you tested the log?”\r\n\r\n“I tested the sand-glass by the bullet, and checked the log by a round\r\nshot.”\r\n\r\n“Of what size was the shot?”\r\n\r\n“One foot in diameter.”\r\n\r\n“Heavy enough?”\r\n\r\n“It is an old round shot of our war hooker, La Casse de Par-Grand.”\r\n\r\n“Which was in the Armada?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And which carried six hundred soldiers, fifty sailors, and twenty-five\r\nguns?”\r\n\r\n“Shipwreck knows it.”\r\n\r\n“How did you compute the resistance of the water to the shot?”\r\n\r\n“By means of a German scale.”\r\n\r\n“Have you taken into account the resistance of the rope supporting the\r\nshot to the waves?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What was the result?”\r\n\r\n“The resistance of the water was 170 pounds.”\r\n\r\n“That’s to say she is running four French leagues an hour.”\r\n\r\n“And three Dutch leagues.”\r\n\r\n“But that is the difference merely of the vessel’s way and the rate at\r\nwhich the sea is running?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly.”\r\n\r\n“Whither are you steering?”\r\n\r\n“For a creek I know, between Loyola and St. Sebastian.”\r\n\r\n“Make the latitude of the harbour’s mouth as soon as possible.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, as near as I can.”\r\n\r\n“Beware of gusts and currents. The first cause the second.”\r\n\r\n“Traidores.”[4]\r\n\r\n“No abuse. The sea understands. Insult nothing. Rest satisfied with\r\nwatching.”\r\n\r\n“I have watched, and I do watch. Just now the tide is running against\r\nthe wind; by-and-by, when it turns, we shall be all right.”\r\n\r\n“Have you a chart?”\r\n\r\n“No; not for this channel.”\r\n\r\n“Then you sail by rule of thumb?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. I have a compass.”\r\n\r\n“The compass is one eye, the chart the other.”\r\n\r\n“A man with one eye can see.”\r\n\r\n“How do you compute the difference between the true and apparent\r\ncourse?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got my standard compass, and I make a guess.”\r\n\r\n“To guess is all very well. To know for certain is better.”\r\n\r\n“Christopher guessed.”\r\n\r\n“When there is a fog and the needle revolves treacherously, you can\r\nnever tell on which side you should look out for squalls, and the end of\r\nit is that you know neither the true nor apparent day’s work. An ass\r\nwith his chart is better off than a wizard with his oracle.”\r\n\r\n“There is no fog in the breeze yet, and I see no cause for alarm.”\r\n\r\n“Ships are like flies in the spider’s web of the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Just now both winds and waves are tolerably favourable.”\r\n\r\n“Black specks quivering on the billows--such are men on the ocean.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say there will be nothing wrong to-night.”\r\n\r\n“You may get into such a mess that you will find it hard to get out of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“All goes well at present.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor’s eyes were fixed on the north-east. The skipper continued,--\r\n\r\n“Let us once reach the Gulf of Gascony, and I answer for our safety. Ah!\r\nI should say I am at home there. I know it well, my Gulf of Gascony. It\r\nis a little basin, often very boisterous; but there, I know every\r\nsounding in it and the nature of the bottom--mud opposite San Cipriano,\r\nshells opposite Cizarque, sand off Cape Peñas, little pebbles off\r\nBoncaut de Mimizan, and I know the colour of every pebble.”\r\n\r\nThe skipper broke off; the doctor was no longer listening.\r\n\r\nThe doctor gazed at the north-east. Over that icy face passed an\r\nextraordinary expression. All the agony of terror possible to a mask of\r\nstone was depicted there. From his mouth escaped this word, “Good!”\r\n\r\nHis eyeballs, which had all at once become quite round like an owl’s,\r\nwere dilated with stupor on discovering a speck on the horizon. He\r\nadded,--\r\n\r\n“It is well. As for me, I am resigned.”\r\n\r\nThe skipper looked at him. The doctor went on talking to himself, or to\r\nsome one in the deep,--\r\n\r\n“I say, Yes.”\r\n\r\nThen he was silent, opened his eyes wider and wider with renewed\r\nattention on that which he was watching, and said,--\r\n\r\n“It is coming from afar, but not the less surely will it come.”\r\n\r\nThe arc of the horizon which occupied the visual rays and thoughts of\r\nthe doctor, being opposite to the west, was illuminated by the\r\ntranscendent reflection of twilight, as if it were day. This arc,\r\nlimited in extent, and surrounded by streaks of grayish vapour, was\r\nuniformly blue, but of a leaden rather than cerulean blue. The doctor,\r\nhaving completely returned to the contemplation of the sea, pointed to\r\nthis atmospheric arc, and said,--\r\n\r\n“Skipper, do you see?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“That.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Out there.”\r\n\r\n“A blue spot? Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“A niche in heaven.”\r\n\r\n“For those who go to heaven; for those who go elsewhere it is another\r\naffair.” And he emphasized these enigmatical words with an appalling\r\nexpression which was unseen in the darkness.\r\n\r\nA silence ensued. The skipper, remembering the two names given by the\r\nchief to this man, asked himself the question,--\r\n\r\n“Is he a madman, or is he a sage?”\r\n\r\nThe stiff and bony finger of the doctor remained immovably pointing,\r\nlike a sign-post, to the misty blue spot in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe skipper looked at this spot.\r\n\r\n“In truth,” he growled out, “it is not sky but clouds.”\r\n\r\n“A blue cloud is worse than a black cloud,” said the doctor; “and,” he\r\nadded, “it’s a snow-cloud.”\r\n\r\n“La nube de la nieve,” said the skipper, as if trying to understand the\r\nword better by translating it.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what a snow-cloud is?” asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll know by-and-by.”\r\n\r\nThe skipper again turned his attention to the horizon.\r\n\r\nContinuing to observe the cloud, he muttered between his teeth,--\r\n\r\n“One month of squalls, another of wet; January with its gales, February\r\nwith its rains--that’s all the winter we Asturians get. Our rain even is\r\nwarm. We’ve no snow but on the mountains. Ay, ay; look out for the\r\navalanche. The avalanche is no respecter of persons. The avalanche is a\r\nbrute.”\r\n\r\n“And the waterspout is a monster,” said the doctor, adding, after a\r\npause, “Here it comes.” He continued, “Several winds are getting up\r\ntogether--a strong wind from the west, and a gentle wind from the east.”\r\n\r\n“That last is a deceitful one,” said the skipper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe blue cloud was growing larger.\r\n\r\n“If the snow,” said the doctor, “is appalling when it slips down the\r\nmountain, think what it is when it falls from the Pole!”\r\n\r\nHis eye was glassy. The cloud seemed to spread over his face and\r\nsimultaneously over the horizon. He continued, in musing tones,--\r\n\r\n“Every minute the fatal hour draws nearer. The will of Heaven is about\r\nto be manifested.”\r\n\r\nThe skipper asked himself again this question,--“Is he a madman?”\r\n\r\n“Skipper,” began the doctor, without taking his eyes off the cloud,\r\n“have you often crossed the Channel?”\r\n\r\n“This is the first time.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who was absorbed by the blue cloud, and who, as a sponge can\r\ntake up but a definite quantity of water, had but a definite measure of\r\nanxiety, displayed no more emotion at this answer of the skipper than\r\nwas expressed by a slight shrug of his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“How is that?”\r\n\r\n“Master Doctor, my usual cruise is to Ireland. I sail from Fontarabia to\r\nBlack Harbour or to the Achill Islands. I go sometimes to Braich-y-Pwll,\r\na point on the Welsh coast. But I always steer outside the Scilly\r\nIslands. I do not know this sea at all.”\r\n\r\n“That’s serious. Woe to him who is inexperienced on the ocean! One ought\r\nto be familiar with the Channel--the Channel is the Sphinx. Look out for\r\nshoals.”\r\n\r\n“We are in twenty-five fathoms here.”\r\n\r\n“We ought to get into fifty-five fathoms to the west, and avoid even\r\ntwenty fathoms to the east.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll sound as we get on.”\r\n\r\n“The Channel is not an ordinary sea. The water rises fifty feet with the\r\nspring tides, and twenty-five with neap tides. Here we are in slack\r\nwater. I thought you looked scared.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll sound to-night.”\r\n\r\n“To sound you must heave to, and that you cannot do.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“On account of the wind.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll try.”\r\n\r\n“The squall is close on us.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll sound, Master Doctor.”\r\n\r\n“You could not even bring to.”\r\n\r\n“Trust in God.”\r\n\r\n“Take care what you say. Pronounce not lightly the awful name.”\r\n\r\n“I will sound, I tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Be sensible; you will have a gale of wind presently.”\r\n\r\n“I say that I will try for soundings.”\r\n\r\n“The resistance of the water will prevent the lead from sinking, and the\r\nline will break. Ah! so this is your first time in these waters?”\r\n\r\n“The first time.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; in that case listen, skipper.”\r\n\r\nThe tone of the word “listen” was so commanding that the skipper made an\r\nobeisance.\r\n\r\n“Master Doctor, I am all attention.”\r\n\r\n“Port your helm, and haul up on the starboard tack.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Steer your course to the west.”\r\n\r\n“Caramba!”\r\n\r\n“Steer your course to the west.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible.”\r\n\r\n“As you will. What I tell you is for the others’ sake. As for myself, I\r\nam indifferent.”\r\n\r\n“But, Master Doctor, steer west?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, skipper.”\r\n\r\n“The wind will be dead ahead.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, skipper.”\r\n\r\n“She’ll pitch like the devil.”\r\n\r\n“Moderate your language. Yes, skipper.”\r\n\r\n“The vessel would be in irons.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, skipper.”\r\n\r\n“That means very likely the mast will go.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly.”\r\n\r\n“Do you wish me to steer west?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot.”\r\n\r\n“In that case settle your reckoning with the sea.”\r\n\r\n“The wind ought to change.”\r\n\r\n“It will not change all night.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because it is a wind twelve hundred leagues in length.”\r\n\r\n“Make headway against such a wind! Impossible.”\r\n\r\n“To the west, I tell you.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll try, but in spite of everything she will fall off.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the danger.”\r\n\r\n“The wind sets us to the east.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t go to the east.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Skipper, do you know what is for us the word of death?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Death is the east.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll steer west.”\r\n\r\nThis time the doctor, having turned right round, looked the skipper full\r\nin the face, and with his eyes resting on him, as though to implant the\r\nidea in his head, pronounced slowly, syllable by syllable, these\r\nwords,--\r\n\r\n“If to-night out at sea we hear the sound of a bell, the ship is lost.”\r\n\r\nThe skipper pondered in amaze.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\nThe doctor did not answer. His countenance, expressive for a moment, was\r\nnow reserved. His eyes became vacuous. He did not appear to hear the\r\nskipper’s wondering question. He was now attending to his own monologue.\r\nHis lips let fall, as if mechanically, in a low murmuring tone, these\r\nwords,--\r\n\r\n“The time has come for sullied souls to purify themselves.”\r\n\r\nThe skipper made that expressive grimace which raises the chin towards\r\nthe nose.\r\n\r\n“He is more madman than sage,” he growled, and moved off.\r\n\r\nNevertheless he steered west.\r\n\r\nBut the wind and the sea were rising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nHARDQUANONNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mist was deformed by all sorts of inequalities, bulging out at once\r\non every point of the horizon, as if invisible mouths were busy puffing\r\nout the bags of wind. The formation of the clouds was becoming ominous.\r\nIn the west, as in the east, the sky’s depths were now invaded by the\r\nblue cloud: it advanced in the teeth of the wind. These contradictions\r\nare part of the wind’s vagaries.\r\n\r\nThe sea, which a moment before wore scales, now wore a skin--such is the\r\nnature of that dragon. It was no longer a crocodile: it was a boa. The\r\nskin, lead-coloured and dirty, looked thick, and was crossed by heavy\r\nwrinkles. Here and there, on its surface, bubbles of surge, like\r\npustules, gathered and then burst. The foam was like a leprosy. It was\r\nat this moment that the hooker, still seen from afar by the child,\r\nlighted her signal.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour elapsed.\r\n\r\nThe skipper looked for the doctor: he was no longer on deck. Directly\r\nthe skipper had left him, the doctor had stooped his somewhat ungainly\r\nform under the hood, and had entered the cabin; there he had sat down\r\nnear the stove, on a block. He had taken a shagreen ink-bottle and a\r\ncordwain pocket-book from his pocket; he had extracted from his\r\npocket-book a parchment folded four times, old, stained, and yellow; he\r\nhad opened the sheet, taken a pen out of his ink-case, placed the\r\npocket-book flat on his knee, and the parchment on the pocket-book; and\r\nby the rays of the lantern, which was lighting the cook, he set to\r\nwriting on the back of the parchment. The roll of the waves\r\ninconvenienced him. He wrote thus for some time.\r\n\r\nAs he wrote, the doctor remarked the gourd of aguardiente, which the\r\nProvençal tasted every time he added a grain of pimento to the puchero,\r\nas if he were consulting it in reference to the seasoning. The doctor\r\nnoticed the gourd, not because it was a bottle of brandy, but because of\r\na name which was plaited in the wickerwork with red rushes on a\r\nbackground of white. There was light enough in the cabin to permit of\r\nhis reading the name.\r\n\r\nThe doctor paused, and spelled it in a low voice,--\r\n\r\n“Hardquanonne.”\r\n\r\nThen he addressed the cook.\r\n\r\n“I had not observed that gourd before; did it belong to Hardquanonne?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” the cook answered; “to our poor comrade, Hardquanonne.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor went on,--\r\n\r\n“To Hardquanonne, the Fleming of Flanders?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Who is in prison?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“In the dungeon at Chatham?”\r\n\r\n“It is his gourd,” replied the cook; “and he was my friend. I keep it in\r\nremembrance of him. When shall we see him again? It is the bottle he\r\nused to wear slung over his hip.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor took up his pen again, and continued laboriously tracing\r\nsomewhat straggling lines on the parchment. He was evidently anxious\r\nthat his handwriting should be very legible; and at length,\r\nnotwithstanding the tremulousness of the vessel and the tremulousness of\r\nage, he finished what he wanted to write.\r\n\r\nIt was time, for suddenly a sea struck the craft, a mighty rush of\r\nwaters besieged the hooker, and they felt her break into that fearful\r\ndance in which ships lead off with the tempest.\r\n\r\nThe doctor arose and approached the stove, meeting the ship’s motion\r\nwith his knees dexterously bent, dried as best he could, at the stove\r\nwhere the pot was boiling, the lines he had written, refolded the\r\nparchment in the pocket-book, and replaced the pocket-book and the\r\ninkhorn in his pocket.\r\n\r\nThe stove was not the least ingenious piece of interior economy in the\r\nhooker. It was judiciously isolated. Meanwhile the pot heaved--the\r\nProvençal was watching it.\r\n\r\n“Fish broth,” said he.\r\n\r\n“For the fishes,” replied the doctor. Then he went on deck again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHEY THINK THAT HELP IS AT HAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough his growing preoccupation the doctor in some sort reviewed the\r\nsituation; and any one near to him might have heard these words drop\r\nfrom his lips,--\r\n\r\n“Too much rolling, and not enough pitching.”\r\n\r\nThen recalled to himself by the dark workings of his mind, he sank again\r\ninto thought, as a miner into his shaft. His meditation in nowise\r\ninterfered with his watch on the sea. The contemplation of the sea is in\r\nitself a reverie.\r\n\r\nThe dark punishment of the waters, eternally tortured, was commencing. A\r\nlamentation arose from the whole main. Preparations, confused and\r\nmelancholy, were forming in space. The doctor observed all before him,\r\nand lost no detail. There was, however, no sign of scrutiny in his face.\r\nOne does not scrutinize hell.\r\n\r\nA vast commotion, yet half latent, but visible through the turmoils in\r\nspace, increased and irritated, more and more, the winds, the vapours,\r\nthe waves. Nothing is so logical and nothing appears so absurd as the\r\nocean. Self-dispersion is the essence of its sovereignty, and is one of\r\nthe elements of its redundance. The sea is ever for and against. It\r\nknots that it may unravel itself; one of its slopes attacks, the other\r\nrelieves. No apparition is so wonderful as the waves. Who can paint the\r\nalternating hollows and promontories, the valleys, the melting bosoms,\r\nthe sketches? How render the thickets of foam, blendings of mountains\r\nand dreams? The indescribable is everywhere there--in the rending, in\r\nthe frowning, in the anxiety, in the perpetual contradiction, in the\r\nchiaroscuro, in the pendants of the cloud, in the keys of the ever-open\r\nvault, in the disaggregation without rupture, in the funereal tumult\r\ncaused by all that madness!\r\n\r\nThe wind had just set due north. Its violence was so favourable and so\r\nuseful in driving them away from England that the captain of the\r\n_Matutina_ had made up his mind to set all sail. The hooker slipped\r\nthrough the foam as at a gallop, the wind right aft, bounding from wave\r\nto wave in a gay frenzy. The fugitives were delighted, and laughed; they\r\nclapped their hands, applauded the surf, the sea, the wind, the sails,\r\nthe swift progress, the flight, all unmindful of the future. The doctor\r\nappeared not to see them, and dreamt on.\r\n\r\nEvery vestige of day had faded away. This was the moment when the child,\r\nwatching from the distant cliff, lost sight of the hooker. Up to then\r\nhis glance had remained fixed, and, as it were, leaning on the vessel.\r\nWhat part had that look in fate? When the hooker was lost to sight in\r\nthe distance, and when the child could no longer see aught, the child\r\nwent north and the ship went south.\r\n\r\nAll were plunged in darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSUPERHUMAN HORRORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn their part it was with wild jubilee and delight that those on board\r\nthe hooker saw the hostile land recede and lessen behind them. By\r\ndegrees the dark ring of ocean rose higher, dwarfing in twilight\r\nPortland, Purbeck, Tineham, Kimmeridge, the Matravers, the long streaks\r\nof dim cliffs, and the coast dotted with lighthouses.\r\n\r\nEngland disappeared. The fugitives had now nothing round them but the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nAll at once night grew awful.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer extent nor space; the sky became blackness, and\r\nclosed in round the vessel. The snow began to fall slowly; a few flakes\r\nappeared. They might have been ghosts. Nothing else was visible in the\r\ncourse of the wind. They felt as if yielded up. A snare lurked in every\r\npossibility.\r\n\r\nIt is in this cavernous darkness that in our climate the Polar\r\nwaterspout makes its appearance.\r\n\r\nA great muddy cloud, like to the belly of a hydra, hung over ocean, and\r\nin places its lividity adhered to the waves. Some of these adherences\r\nresembled pouches with holes, pumping the sea, disgorging vapour, and\r\nrefilling themselves with water. Here and there these suctions drew up\r\ncones of foam on the sea.\r\n\r\nThe boreal storm hurled itself on the hooker. The hooker rushed to meet\r\nit. The squall and the vessel met as though to insult each other.\r\n\r\nIn the first mad shock not a sail was clewed up, not a jib lowered, not\r\na reef taken in, so much is flight a delirium. The mast creaked and bent\r\nback as if in fear.\r\n\r\nCyclones, in our northern hemisphere, circle from left to right, in the\r\nsame direction as the hands of a watch, with a velocity which is\r\nsometimes as much as sixty miles an hour. Although she was entirely at\r\nthe mercy of that whirling power, the hooker behaved as if she were out\r\nin moderate weather, without any further precaution than keeping her\r\nhead on to the rollers, with the wind broad on the bow so as to avoid\r\nbeing pooped or caught broadside on. This semi-prudence would have\r\navailed her nothing in case of the wind’s shifting and taking her aback.\r\n\r\nA deep rumbling was brewing up in the distance. The roar of the abyss,\r\nnothing can be compared to it. It is the great brutish howl of the\r\nuniverse. What we call matter, that unsearchable organism, that\r\namalgamation of incommensurable energies, in which can occasionally be\r\ndetected an almost imperceptible degree of intention which makes us\r\nshudder, that blind, benighted cosmos, that enigmatical Pan, has a cry,\r\na strange cry, prolonged, obstinate, and continuous, which is less than\r\nspeech and more than thunder. That cry is the hurricane. Other voices,\r\nsongs, melodies, clamours, tones, proceed from nests, from broods, from\r\npairings, from nuptials, from homes. This one, a trumpet, comes out of\r\nthe Naught, which is All. Other voices express the soul of the universe;\r\nthis one expresses the monster. It is the howl of the formless. It is\r\nthe inarticulate finding utterance in the indefinite. A thing it is full\r\nof pathos and terror. Those clamours converse above and beyond man. They\r\nrise, fall, undulate, determine waves of sound, form all sorts of wild\r\nsurprises for the mind, now burst close to the ear with the importunity\r\nof a peal of trumpets, now assail us with the rumbling hoarseness of\r\ndistance. Giddy uproar which resembles a language, and which, in fact,\r\nis a language. It is the effort which the world makes to speak. It is\r\nthe lisping of the wonderful. In this wail is manifested vaguely all\r\nthat the vast dark palpitation endures, suffers, accepts, rejects. For\r\nthe most part it talks nonsense; it is like an access of chronic\r\nsickness, and rather an epilepsy diffused than a force employed; we\r\nfancy that we are witnessing the descent of supreme evil into the\r\ninfinite. At moments we seem to discern a reclamation of the elements,\r\nsome vain effort of chaos to reassert itself over creation. At times it\r\nis a complaint. The void bewails and justifies itself. It is as the\r\npleading of the world’s cause. We can fancy that the universe is engaged\r\nin a lawsuit; we listen--we try to grasp the reasons given, the\r\nredoubtable for and against. Such a moaning of the shadows has the\r\ntenacity of a syllogism. Here is a vast trouble for thought. Here is the\r\n_raison d’être_ of mythologies and polytheisms. To the terror of those\r\ngreat murmurs are added superhuman outlines melting away as they\r\nappear--Eumenides which are almost distinct, throats of Furies shaped in\r\nthe clouds, Plutonian chimeras almost defined. No horrors equal those\r\nsobs, those laughs, those tricks of tumult, those inscrutable questions\r\nand answers, those appeals to unknown aid. Man knows not what to become\r\nin the presence of that awful incantation. He bows under the enigma of\r\nthose Draconian intonations. What latent meaning have they? What do they\r\nsignify? What do they threaten? What do they implore? It would seem as\r\nthough all bonds were loosened. Vociferations from precipice to\r\nprecipice, from air to water, from the wind to the wave, from the rain\r\nto the rock, from the zenith to the nadir, from the stars to the\r\nfoam--the abyss unmuzzled--such is that tumult, complicated by some\r\nmysterious strife with evil consciences.\r\n\r\nThe loquacity of night is not less lugubrious than its silence. One\r\nfeels in it the anger of the unknown.\r\n\r\nNight is a presence. Presence of what?\r\n\r\nFor that matter we must distinguish between night and the shadows. In\r\nthe night there is the absolute; in the darkness the multiple. Grammar,\r\nlogic as it is, admits of no singular for the shadows. The night is one,\r\nthe shadows are many.[5]\r\n\r\nThis mist of nocturnal mystery is the scattered, the fugitive, the\r\ncrumbling, the fatal; one feels earth no longer, one feels the other\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nIn the shadow, infinite and indefinite, lives something or some one; but\r\nthat which lives there forms part of our death. After our earthly\r\npassage, when that shadow shall be light for us, the life which is\r\nbeyond our life shall seize us. Meanwhile it appears to touch and try\r\nus. Obscurity is a pressure. Night is, as it were, a hand placed on our\r\nsoul. At certain hideous and solemn hours we feel that which is beyond\r\nthe wall of the tomb encroaching on us.\r\n\r\nNever does this proximity of the unknown seem more imminent than in\r\nstorms at sea. The horrible combines with the fantastic. The possible\r\ninterrupter of human actions, the old Cloud compeller, has it in his\r\npower to mould, in whatsoever shape he chooses, the inconsistent\r\nelement, the limitless incoherence, the force diffused and undecided of\r\naim. That mystery the tempest every instant accepts and executes some\r\nunknown changes of will, apparent or real.\r\n\r\nPoets have, in all ages, called this the caprice of the waves. But there\r\nis no such thing as caprice. The disconcerting enigmas which in nature\r\nwe call caprice, and in human life chance, are splinters of a law\r\nrevealed to us in glimpses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nNIX ET NOX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe characteristic of the snowstorm is its blackness. Nature’s habitual\r\naspect during a storm, the earth or sea black and the sky pale, is\r\nreversed; the sky is black, the ocean white, foam below, darkness\r\nabove; a horizon walled in with smoke; a zenith roofed with crape. The\r\ntempest resembles a cathedral hung with mourning, but no light in that\r\ncathedral: no phantom lights on the crests of the waves, no spark, no\r\nphosphorescence, naught but a huge shadow. The polar cyclone differs\r\nfrom the tropical cyclone, inasmuch as the one sets fire to every light,\r\nand the other extinguishes them all. The world is suddenly converted\r\ninto the arched vault of a cave. Out of the night falls a dust of pale\r\nspots, which hesitate between sky and sea. These spots, which are flakes\r\nof snow, slip, wander, and flow. It is like the tears of a winding-sheet\r\nputting themselves into lifelike motion. A mad wind mingles with this\r\ndissemination. Blackness crumbling into whiteness, the furious into the\r\nobscure, all the tumult of which the sepulchre is capable, a whirlwind\r\nunder a catafalque--such is the snowstorm. Underneath trembles the\r\nocean, forming and re-forming over portentous unknown depths.\r\n\r\nIn the polar wind, which is electrical, the flakes turn suddenly into\r\nhailstones, and the air becomes filled with projectiles; the water\r\ncrackles, shot with grape.\r\n\r\nNo thunderstrokes: the lightning of boreal storms is silent. What is\r\nsometimes said of the cat, “it swears,” may be applied to this\r\nlightning. It is a menace proceeding from a mouth half open and\r\nstrangely inexorable. The snowstorm is a storm blind and dumb; when it\r\nhas passed, the ships also are often blind and the sailors dumb.\r\n\r\nTo escape from such an abyss is difficult.\r\n\r\nIt would be wrong, however, to believe shipwreck to be absolutely\r\ninevitable. The Danish fishermen of Disco and the Balesin; the seekers\r\nof black whales; Hearn steering towards Behring Strait, to discover the\r\nmouth of Coppermine River; Hudson, Mackenzie, Vancouver, Ross, Dumont\r\nD’Urville, all underwent at the Pole itself the wildest hurricanes, and\r\nescaped out of them.\r\n\r\nIt was into this description of tempest that the hooker had entered,\r\ntriumphant and in full sail--frenzy against frenzy. When Montgomery,\r\nescaping from Rouen, threw his galley, with all the force of its oars,\r\nagainst the chain barring the Seine at La Bouille, he showed similar\r\neffrontery.\r\n\r\nThe _Matutina_ sailed on fast; she bent so much under her sails that at\r\nmoments she made a fearful angle with the sea of fifteen degrees; but\r\nher good bellied keel adhered to the water as if glued to it. The keel\r\nresisted the grasp of the hurricane. The lantern at the prow cast its\r\nlight ahead.\r\n\r\nThe cloud, full of winds, dragging its tumour over the deep, cramped and\r\neat more and more into the sea round the hooker. Not a gull, not a\r\nsea-mew, nothing but snow. The expanse of the field of waves was\r\nbecoming contracted and terrible; only three or four gigantic ones were\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nNow and then a tremendous flash of lightning of a red copper colour\r\nbroke out behind the obscure superposition of the horizon and the\r\nzenith; that sudden release of vermilion flame revealed the horror of\r\nthe clouds; that abrupt conflagration of the depths, to which for an\r\ninstant the first tiers of clouds and the distant boundaries of the\r\ncelestial chaos seemed to adhere, placed the abyss in perspective. On\r\nthis ground of fire the snow-flakes showed black--they might have been\r\ncompared to dark butterflies flying about in a furnace--then all was\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nThe first explosion over, the squall, still pursuing the hooker, began\r\nto roar in thorough bass. This phase of grumbling is a perilous\r\ndiminution of uproar. Nothing is so terrifying as this monologue of the\r\nstorm. This gloomy recitative appears to serve as a moment of rest to\r\nthe mysterious combating forces, and indicates a species of patrol kept\r\nin the unknown.\r\n\r\nThe hooker held wildly on her course. Her two mainsails especially were\r\ndoing fearful work. The sky and sea were as of ink with jets of foam\r\nrunning higher than the mast. Every instant masses of water swept the\r\ndeck like a deluge, and at each roll of the vessel the hawse-holes, now\r\nto starboard, now to larboard, became as so many open mouths vomiting\r\nback the foam into the sea. The women had taken refuge in the cabin, but\r\nthe men remained on deck; the blinding snow eddied round, the spitting\r\nsurge mingled with it. All was fury.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the chief of the band, standing abaft on the stern\r\nframes, holding on with one hand to the shrouds, and with the other\r\ntaking off the kerchief he wore round his head and waving it in the\r\nlight of the lantern, gay and arrogant, with pride in his face, and his\r\nhair in wild disorder, intoxicated by all the darkness, cried out,--\r\n\r\n“We are free!”\r\n\r\n“Free, free, free,” echoed the fugitives, and the band, seizing hold of\r\nthe rigging, rose up on deck.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” shouted the chief.\r\n\r\nAnd the band shouted in the storm,--\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!”\r\n\r\nJust as this clamour was dying away in the tempest, a loud solemn voice\r\nrose from the other end of the vessel, saying,--\r\n\r\n“Silence!”\r\n\r\nAll turned their heads. The darkness was thick, and the doctor was\r\nleaning against the mast so that he seemed part of it, and they could\r\nnot see him.\r\n\r\nThe voice spoke again,--\r\n\r\n“Listen!”\r\n\r\nAll were silent.\r\n\r\nThen did they distinctly hear through the darkness the toll of a bell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE CHARGE CONFIDED TO A RAGING SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe skipper, at the helm, burst out laughing,--\r\n\r\n“A bell! that’s good. We are on the larboard tack. What does the bell\r\nprove? Why, that we have land to starboard.”\r\n\r\nThe firm and measured voice of the doctor replied,--\r\n\r\n“You have not land to starboard.”\r\n\r\n“But we have,” shouted the skipper.\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“But that bell tolls from the land.”\r\n\r\n“That bell,” said the doctor, “tolls from the sea.”\r\n\r\nA shudder passed over these daring men. The haggard faces of the two\r\nwomen appeared above the companion like two hobgoblins conjured up. The\r\ndoctor took a step forward, separating his tall form from the mast. From\r\nthe depth of the night’s darkness came the toll of the bell.\r\n\r\nThe doctor resumed,--\r\n\r\n“There is in the midst of the sea, halfway between Portland and the\r\nChannel Islands, a buoy, placed there as a caution; that buoy is moored\r\nby chains to the shoal, and floats on the top of the water. On the buoy\r\nis fixed an iron trestle, and across the trestle a bell is hung. In bad\r\nweather heavy seas toss the buoy, and the bell rings. That is the bell\r\nyou hear.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor paused to allow an extra violent gust of wind to pass over,\r\nwaited until the sound of the bell reasserted itself, and then went\r\non,--\r\n\r\n“To hear that bell in a storm, when the nor’-wester is blowing, is to be\r\nlost. Wherefore? For this reason: if you hear the bell, it is because\r\nthe wind brings it to you. But the wind is nor’-westerly, and the\r\nbreakers of Aurigny lie east. You hear the bell only because you are\r\nbetween the buoy and the breakers. It is on those breakers the wind is\r\ndriving you. You are on the wrong side of the buoy. If you were on the\r\nright side, you would be out at sea on a safe course, and you would not\r\nhear the bell. The wind would not convey the sound to you. You would\r\npass close to the buoy without knowing it. We are out of our course.\r\nThat bell is shipwreck sounding the tocsin. Now, look out!”\r\n\r\nAs the doctor spoke, the bell, soothed by a lull of the storm, rang\r\nslowly stroke by stroke, and its intermitting toll seemed to testify to\r\nthe truth of the old man’s words. It was as the knell of the abyss.\r\n\r\nAll listened breathless, now to the voice, now to the bell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE COLOSSAL SAVAGE, THE STORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the skipper had caught up his speaking-trumpet.\r\n\r\n“Strike every sail, my lads; let go the sheets, man the down-hauls,\r\nlower ties and brails. Let us steer to the west, let us regain the high\r\nsea; head for the buoy, steer for the bell--there’s an offing down\r\nthere. We’ve yet a chance.”\r\n\r\n“Try,” said the doctor.\r\n\r\nLet us remark here, by the way, that this ringing buoy, a kind of bell\r\ntower on the deep, was removed in 1802. There are yet alive very old\r\nmariners who remember hearing it. It forewarned, but rather too late.\r\n\r\nThe orders of the skipper were obeyed. The Languedocian made a third\r\nsailor. All bore a hand. Not satisfied with brailing up, they furled the\r\nsails, lashed the earrings, secured the clew-lines, bunt-lines, and\r\nleech-lines, and clapped preventer-shrouds on the block straps, which\r\nthus might serve as back-stays. They fished the mast. They battened down\r\nthe ports and bulls’-eyes, which is a method of walling up a ship. These\r\nevolutions, though executed in a lubberly fashion, were, nevertheless,\r\nthoroughly effective. The hooker was stripped to bare poles. But in\r\nproportion as the vessel, stowing every stitch of canvas, became more\r\nhelpless, the havoc of both winds and waves increased. The seas ran\r\nmountains high. The hurricane, like an executioner hastening to his\r\nvictim, began to dismember the craft. There came, in the twinkling of an\r\neye, a dreadful crash: the top-sails were blown from the bolt-ropes, the\r\nchess-trees were hewn asunder, the deck was swept clear, the shrouds\r\nwere carried away, the mast went by the board, all the lumber of the\r\nwreck was flying in shivers. The main shrouds gave out although they\r\nwere turned in, and stoppered to four fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic currents common to snowstorms hastened the destruction of\r\nthe rigging. It broke as much from the effect of effluvium as the\r\nviolence of the wind. Most of the chain gear, fouled in the blocks,\r\nceased to work. Forward the bows, aft the quarters, quivered under the\r\nterrific shocks. One wave washed overboard the compass and its binnacle.\r\nA second carried away the boat, which, like a box slung under a\r\ncarriage, had been, in accordance with the quaint Asturian custom,\r\nlashed to the bowsprit. A third breaker wrenched off the spritsail yard.\r\nA fourth swept away the figurehead and signal light. The rudder only was\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nTo replace the ship’s bow lantern they set fire to, and suspended at the\r\nstem, a large block of wood covered with oakum and tar.\r\n\r\nThe mast, broken in two, all bristling with quivering splinters, ropes,\r\nblocks, and yards, cumbered the deck. In falling it had stove in a plank\r\nof the starboard gunwale. The skipper, still firm at the helm,\r\nshouted,--\r\n\r\n“While we can steer we have yet a chance. The lower planks hold good.\r\nAxes, axes! Overboard with the mast! Clear the decks!”\r\n\r\nBoth crew and passengers worked with the excitement of despair. A few\r\nstrokes of the hatchets, and it was done. They pushed the mast over the\r\nside. The deck was cleared.\r\n\r\n“Now,” continued the skipper, “take a rope’s end and lash me to the\r\nhelm.” To the tiller they bound him.\r\n\r\nWhile they were fastening him he laughed, and shouted,--\r\n\r\n“Blow, old hurdy-gurdy, bellow. I’ve seen your equal off Cape\r\nMachichaco.”\r\n\r\nAnd when secured he clutched the helm with that strange hilarity which\r\ndanger awakens.\r\n\r\n“All goes well, my lads. Long live our Lady of Buglose! Let us steer\r\nwest.”\r\n\r\nAn enormous wave came down abeam, and fell on the vessel’s quarter.\r\nThere is always in storms a tiger-like wave, a billow fierce and\r\ndecisive, which, attaining a certain height, creeps horizontally over\r\nthe surface of the waters for a time, then rises, roars, rages, and\r\nfalling on the distressed vessel tears it limb from limb.\r\n\r\nA cloud of foam covered the entire poop of the _Matutina_.\r\n\r\nThere was heard above the confusion of darkness and waters a crash.\r\n\r\nWhen the spray cleared off, when the stern again rose in view, the\r\nskipper and the helm had disappeared. Both had been swept away.\r\n\r\nThe helm and the man they had but just secured to it had passed with the\r\nwave into the hissing turmoil of the hurricane.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the band, gazing intently into the darkness, shouted,--\r\n\r\n“_Te burlas de nosotros?_”\r\n\r\nTo this defiant exclamation there followed another cry,--\r\n\r\n“Let go the anchor. Save the skipper.”\r\n\r\nThey rushed to the capstan and let go the anchor.\r\n\r\nHookers carry but one. In this case the anchor reached the bottom, but\r\nonly to be lost. The bottom was of the hardest rock. The billows were\r\nraging with resistless force. The cable snapped like a thread.\r\n\r\nThe anchor lay at the bottom of the sea. At the cutwater there remained\r\nbut the cable end protruding from the hawse-hole.\r\n\r\nFrom this moment the hooker became a wreck. The _Matutina_ was\r\nirrevocably disabled. The vessel, just before in full sail, and almost\r\nformidable in her speed, was now helpless. All her evolutions were\r\nuncertain and executed at random. She yielded passively and like a log\r\nto the capricious fury of the waves. That in a few minutes there should\r\nbe in place of an eagle a useless cripple, such a transformation is to\r\nbe witnessed only at sea.\r\n\r\nThe howling of the wind became more and more frightful. A hurricane has\r\nterrible lungs; it makes unceasingly mournful additions to darkness,\r\nwhich cannot be intensified. The bell on the sea rang despairingly, as\r\nif tolled by a weird hand.\r\n\r\nThe _Matutina_ drifted like a cork at the mercy of the waves. She sailed\r\nno longer--she merely floated. Every moment she seemed about to turn\r\nover on her back, like a dead fish. The good condition and perfectly\r\nwater-tight state of the hull alone saved her from this disaster. Below\r\nthe water-line not a plank had started. There was not a cranny, chink,\r\nnor crack; and she had not made a single drop of water in the hold. This\r\nwas lucky, as the pump, being out of order, was useless.\r\n\r\nThe hooker pitched and roared frightfully in the seething billows. The\r\nvessel had throes as of sickness, and seemed to be trying to belch forth\r\nthe unhappy crew.\r\n\r\nHelpless they clung to the standing rigging, to the transoms, to the\r\nshank painters, to the gaskets, to the broken planks, the protruding\r\nnails of which tore their hands, to the warped riders, and to all the\r\nrugged projections of the stumps of the masts. From time to time they\r\nlistened. The toll of the bell came over the waters fainter and fainter;\r\none would have thought that it also was in distress. Its ringing was no\r\nmore than an intermittent rattle. Then this rattle died away. Where were\r\nthey? At what distance from the buoy? The sound of the bell had\r\nfrightened them; its silence terrified them. The north-wester drove them\r\nforward in perhaps a fatal course. They felt themselves wafted on by\r\nmaddened and ever-recurring gusts of wind. The wreck sped forward in the\r\ndarkness. There is nothing more fearful than being hurried forward\r\nblindfold. They felt the abyss before them, over them, under them. It\r\nwas no longer a run, it was a rush.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, through the appalling density of the snowstorm, there loomed a\r\nred light.\r\n\r\n“A lighthouse!” cried the crew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE CASKETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was indeed the Caskets light.\r\n\r\nA lighthouse of the nineteenth century is a high cylinder of masonry,\r\nsurmounted by scientifically constructed machinery for throwing light.\r\nThe Caskets lighthouse in particular is a triple white tower, bearing\r\nthree light-rooms. These three chambers revolve on clockwork wheels,\r\nwith such precision that the man on watch who sees them from sea can\r\ninvariably take ten steps during their irradiation, and twenty-five\r\nduring their eclipse. Everything is based on the focal plan, and on the\r\nrotation of the octagon drum, formed of eight wide simple lenses in\r\nrange, having above and below it two series of dioptric rings; an\r\nalgebraic gear, secured from the effects of the beating of winds and\r\nwaves by glass a millimetre thick[6], yet sometimes broken by the\r\nsea-eagles, which dash themselves like great moths against these\r\ngigantic lanterns. The building which encloses and sustains this\r\nmechanism, and in which it is set, is also mathematically constructed.\r\nEverything about it is plain, exact, bare, precise, correct. A\r\nlighthouse is a mathematical figure.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century a lighthouse was a sort of plume of the land\r\non the seashore. The architecture of a lighthouse tower was magnificent\r\nand extravagant. It was covered with balconies, balusters, lodges,\r\nalcoves, weathercocks. Nothing but masks, statues, foliage, volutes,\r\nreliefs, figures large and small, medallions with inscriptions. _Pax in\r\nbello_, said the Eddystone lighthouse. We may as well observe, by the\r\nway, that this declaration of peace did not always disarm the ocean.\r\nWinstanley repeated it on a lighthouse which he constructed at his own\r\nexpense, on a wild spot near Plymouth. The tower being finished, he shut\r\nhimself up in it to have it tried by the tempest. The storm came, and\r\ncarried off the lighthouse and Winstanley in it. Such excessive\r\nadornment gave too great a hold to the hurricane, as generals too\r\nbrilliantly equipped in battle draw the enemy’s fire. Besides whimsical\r\ndesigns in stone, they were loaded with whimsical designs in iron,\r\ncopper, and wood. The ironwork was in relief, the woodwork stood out. On\r\nthe sides of the lighthouse there jutted out, clinging to the walls\r\namong the arabesques, engines of every description, useful and useless,\r\nwindlasses, tackles, pulleys, counterpoises, ladders, cranes, grapnels.\r\nOn the pinnacle around the light delicately-wrought ironwork held great\r\niron chandeliers, in which were placed pieces of rope steeped in resin;\r\nwicks which burned doggedly, and which no wind extinguished; and from\r\ntop to bottom the tower was covered by a complication of sea-standards,\r\nbanderoles, banners, flags, pennons, colours which rose from stage to\r\nstage, from story to story, a medley of all hues, all shapes, all\r\nheraldic devices, all signals, all confusion, up to the light chamber,\r\nmaking, in the storm, a gay riot of tatters about the blaze. That\r\ninsolent light on the brink of the abyss showed like a defiance, and\r\ninspired shipwrecked men with a spirit of daring. But the Caskets light\r\nwas not after this fashion.\r\n\r\nIt was, at that period, merely an old barbarous lighthouse, such as\r\nHenry I. had built it after the loss of the _White Ship_--a flaming pile\r\nof wood under an iron trellis, a brazier behind a railing, a head of\r\nhair flaming in the wind.\r\n\r\nThe only improvement made in this lighthouse since the twelfth century\r\nwas a pair of forge-bellows worked by an indented pendulum and a stone\r\nweight, which had been added to the light chamber in 1610.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the sea-birds who chanced to fly against these old\r\nlighthouses was more tragic than those of our days. The birds dashed\r\nagainst them, attracted by the light, and fell into the brazier, where\r\nthey could be seen struggling like black spirits in a hell, and at times\r\nthey would fall back again between the railings upon the rock, red hot,\r\nsmoking, lame, blind, like half-burnt flies out of a lamp.\r\n\r\nTo a full-rigged ship in good trim, answering readily to the pilot’s\r\nhandling, the Caskets light is useful; it cries, “Look out;” it warns\r\nher of the shoal. To a disabled ship it is simply terrible. The hull,\r\nparalyzed and inert, without resistance, without defence against the\r\nimpulse of the storm or the mad heaving of the waves, a fish without\r\nfins, a bird without wings, can but go where the wind wills. The\r\nlighthouse shows the end--points out the spot where it is doomed to\r\ndisappear--throws light upon the burial. It is the torch of the\r\nsepulchre.\r\n\r\nTo light up the inexorable chasm, to warn against the inevitable, what\r\nmore tragic mockery!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nFACE TO FACE WITH THE ROCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wretched people in distress on board the _Matutina_ understood at\r\nonce the mysterious derision which mocked their shipwreck. The\r\nappearance of the lighthouse raised their spirits at first, then\r\noverwhelmed them. Nothing could be done, nothing attempted. What has\r\nbeen said of kings, we may say of the waves--we are their people, we are\r\ntheir prey. All that they rave must be borne. The nor’-wester was\r\ndriving the hooker on the Caskets. They were nearing them; no evasion\r\nwas possible. They drifted rapidly towards the reef; they felt that they\r\nwere getting into shallow waters; the lead, if they could have thrown it\r\nto any purpose, would not have shown more than three or four fathoms.\r\nThe shipwrecked people heard the dull sound of the waves being sucked\r\nwithin the submarine caves of the steep rock. They made out, under the\r\nlighthouse, like a dark cutting between two plates of granite, the\r\nnarrow passage of the ugly wild-looking little harbour, supposed to be\r\nfull of the skeletons of men and carcasses of ships. It looked like the\r\nmouth of a cavern, rather than the entrance of a port. They could hear\r\nthe crackling of the pile on high within the iron grating. A ghastly\r\npurple illuminated the storm; the collision of the rain and hail\r\ndisturbed the mist. The black cloud and the red flame fought, serpent\r\nagainst serpent; live ashes, reft by the wind, flew from the fire, and\r\nthe sudden assaults of the sparks seemed to drive the snowflakes before\r\nthem. The breakers, blurred at first in outline, now stood out in bold\r\nrelief, a medley of rocks with peaks, crests, and vertebræ. The angles\r\nwere formed by strongly marked red lines, and the inclined planes in\r\nblood-like streams of light. As they neared it, the outline of the reefs\r\nincreased and rose--sinister.\r\n\r\nOne of the women, the Irishwoman, told her beads wildly.\r\n\r\nIn place of the skipper, who was the pilot, remained the chief, who was\r\nthe captain. The Basques all know the mountain and the sea. They are\r\nbold on the precipice, and inventive in catastrophes.\r\n\r\nThey neared the cliff. They were about to strike. Suddenly they were so\r\nclose to the great north rock of the Caskets that it shut out the\r\nlighthouse from them. They saw nothing but the rock and the red light\r\nbehind it. The huge rock looming in the mist was like a gigantic black\r\nwoman with a hood of fire.\r\n\r\nThat ill-famed rock is called the Biblet. It faces the north\r\nside the reef, which on the south is faced by another ridge,\r\nL’Etacq-aux-giulmets. The chief looked at the Biblet, and shouted,--\r\n\r\n“A man with a will to take a rope to the rock! Who can swim?”\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nNo one on board knew how to swim, not even the sailors--an ignorance not\r\nuncommon among seafaring people.\r\n\r\nA beam nearly free of its lashings was swinging loose. The chief clasped\r\nit with both hands, crying, “Help me.”\r\n\r\nThey unlashed the beam. They had now at their disposal the very thing\r\nthey wanted. From the defensive, they assumed the offensive.\r\n\r\nIt was a longish beam of heart of oak, sound and strong, useful either\r\nas a support or as an engine of attack--a lever for a burden, a ram\r\nagainst a tower.\r\n\r\n“Ready!” shouted the chief.\r\n\r\nAll six, getting foothold on the stump of the mast, threw their weight\r\non the spar projecting over the side, straight as a lance towards a\r\nprojection of the cliff.\r\n\r\nIt was a dangerous manoeuvre. To strike at a mountain is audacity\r\nindeed. The six men might well have been thrown into the water by the\r\nshock.\r\n\r\nThere is variety in struggles with storms. After the hurricane, the\r\nshoal; after the wind, the rock. First the intangible, then the\r\nimmovable, to be encountered.\r\n\r\nSome minutes passed, such minutes as whiten men’s hair.\r\n\r\nThe rock and the vessel were about to come in collision. The rock, like\r\na culprit, awaited the blow.\r\n\r\nA resistless wave rushed in; it ended the respite. It caught the vessel\r\nunderneath, raised it, and swayed it for an instant as the sling swings\r\nits projectile.\r\n\r\n“Steady!” cried the chief; “it is only a rock, and we are men.”\r\n\r\nThe beam was couched, the six men were one with it, its sharp bolts tore\r\ntheir arm-pits, but they did not feel them.\r\n\r\nThe wave dashed the hooker against the rock.\r\n\r\nThen came the shock.\r\n\r\nIt came under the shapeless cloud of foam which always hides such\r\ncatastrophes.\r\n\r\nWhen this cloud fell back into the sea, when the waves rolled back from\r\nthe rock, the six men were tossing about the deck, but the _Matutina_\r\nwas floating alongside the rock--clear of it. The beam had stood and\r\nturned the vessel; the sea was running so fast that in a few seconds she\r\nhad left the Caskets behind.\r\n\r\nSuch things sometimes occur. It was a straight stroke of the bowsprit\r\nthat saved Wood of Largo at the mouth of the Tay. In the wild\r\nneighbourhood of Cape Winterton, and under the command of Captain\r\nHamilton, it was the appliance of such a lever against the dangerous\r\nrock, Branodu-um, that saved the _Royal Mary_ from shipwreck, although\r\nshe was but a Scotch built frigate. The force of the waves can be so\r\nabruptly discomposed that changes of direction can be easily managed, or\r\nat least are possible even in the most violent collisions. There is a\r\nbrute in the tempest. The hurricane is a bull, and can be turned.\r\n\r\nThe whole secret of avoiding shipwreck is to try and pass from the\r\nsecant to the tangent.\r\n\r\nSuch was the service rendered by the beam to the vessel. It had done the\r\nwork of an oar, had taken the place of a rudder. But the manoeuvre once\r\nperformed could not be repeated. The beam was overboard; the shock of\r\nthe collision had wrenched it out of the men’s hands, and it was lost in\r\nthe waves. To loosen another beam would have been to dislocate the hull.\r\n\r\nThe hurricane carried off the _Matutina_. Presently the Caskets showed\r\nas a harmless encumbrance on the horizon. Nothing looks more out of\r\ncountenance than a reef of rocks under such circumstances. There are in\r\nnature, in its obscure aspects, in which the visible blends with the\r\ninvisible, certain motionless, surly profiles, which seem to express\r\nthat a prey has escaped.\r\n\r\nThus glowered the Caskest while the _Matutina_ fled.\r\n\r\nThe lighthouse paled in distance, faded, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThere was something mournful in its extinction. Layers of mist sank down\r\nupon the now uncertain light. Its rays died in the waste of waters; the\r\nflame floated, struggled, sank, and lost its form. It might have been a\r\ndrowning creature. The brasier dwindled to the snuff of a candle; then\r\nnothing; more but a weak, uncertain flutter. Around it spread a circle\r\nof extravasated glimmer; it was like the quenching of: light in the pit\r\nof night.\r\n\r\nThe bell which had threatened was dumb. The lighthouse which had\r\nthreatened had melted away. And yet it was more awful now that they had\r\nceased to threaten. One was a voice, the other a torch. There was\r\nsomething human about them.\r\n\r\nThey were gone, and nought remained but the abyss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nFACE TO FACE WITH NIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain was the hooker running with the shadow into immeasurable darkness.\r\n\r\nThe _Matutina_, escaped from the Caskets, sank and rose from billow to\r\nbillow. A respite, but in chaos.\r\n\r\nSpun round by the wind, tossed by all the thousand motions of the wave,\r\nshe reflected every mad oscillation of the sea. She scarcely pitched at\r\nall--a terrible symptom of a ship’s distress. Wrecks merely roll.\r\nPitching is a convulsion of the strife. The helm alone can turn a vessel\r\nto the wind.\r\n\r\nIn storms, and more especially in the meteors of snow, sea and night\r\nend by melting into amalgamation, resolving into nothing but a smoke.\r\nMists, whirlwinds, gales, motion in all directions, no basis, no\r\nshelter, no stop. Constant recommencement, one gulf succeeding another.\r\nNo horizon visible; intense blackness for background. Through all these\r\nthe hooker drifted.\r\n\r\nTo have got free of the Caskets, to have eluded the rock, was a victory\r\nfor the shipwrecked men; but it was a victory which left them in stupor.\r\nThey had raised no cheer: at sea such an imprudence is not repeated\r\ntwice. To throw down a challenge where they could not cast the lead,\r\nwould have been too serious a jest.\r\n\r\nThe repulse of the rock was an impossibility achieved. They were\r\npetrified by it. By degrees, however, they began to hope again. Such are\r\nthe insubmergable mirages of the soul! There is no distress so complete\r\nbut that even in the most critical moments the inexplicable sunrise of\r\nhope is seen in its depths. These poor wretches were ready to\r\nacknowledge to themselves that they were saved. It was on their lips.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly something terrible appeared to them in the darkness.\r\n\r\nOn the port bow arose, standing stark, cut out on the background of\r\nmist, a tall, opaque mass, vertical, right-angled, a tower of the abyss.\r\nThey watched it open-mouthed.\r\n\r\nThe storm was driving them towards it.\r\n\r\nThey knew not what it was. It was the Ortach rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nORTACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reef reappeared. After the Caskets comes Ortach. The storm is no\r\nartist; brutal and all-powerful, it never varies its appliances. The\r\ndarkness is inexhaustible. Its snares and perfidies never come to an\r\nend. As for man, he soon comes to the bottom of his resources. Man\r\nexpends his strength, the abyss never.\r\n\r\nThe shipwrecked men turned towards the chief, their hope. He could only\r\nshrug his shoulders. Dismal contempt of helplessness.\r\n\r\nA pavement in the midst of the ocean--such is the Ortach rock. The\r\nOrtach, all of a piece, rises up in a straight line to eighty feet above\r\nthe angry beating of the waves. Waves and ships break against it. An\r\nimmovable cube, it plunges its rectilinear planes apeak into the\r\nnumberless serpentine curves of the sea.\r\n\r\nAt night it stands an enormous block resting on the folds of a huge\r\nblack sheet. In time of storm it awaits the stroke of the axe, which is\r\nthe thunder-clap.\r\n\r\nBut there is never a thunder-clap during the snowstorm. True, the ship\r\nhas the bandage round her eyes; darkness is knotted about her; she is\r\nlike one prepared to be led to the scaffold. As for the thunderbolt,\r\nwhich makes quick ending, it is not to be hoped for.\r\n\r\nThe _Matutina_, nothing better than a log upon the waters, drifted\r\ntowards this rock as she had drifted towards the other. The poor\r\nwretches on board, who had for a moment believed themselves saved,\r\nrelapsed into their agony. The destruction they had left behind faced\r\nthem again. The reef reappeared from the bottom of the sea. Nothing had\r\nbeen gained.\r\n\r\nThe Caskets are a figuring iron[7] with a thousand compartments. The\r\nOrtach is a wall. To be wrecked on the Caskets is to be cut into\r\nribbons; to strike on the Ortach is to be crushed into powder.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there was one chance.\r\n\r\nOn a straight frontage such as that of the Ortach neither the wave nor\r\nthe cannon ball can ricochet. The operation is simple: first the flux,\r\nthen the reflux; a wave advances, a billow returns.\r\n\r\nIn such cases the question of life and death is balanced thus: if the\r\nwave carries the vessel on the rock, she breaks on it and is lost; if\r\nthe billow retires before the ship has touched, she is carried back, she\r\nis saved.\r\n\r\nIt was a moment of great anxiety; those on board saw through the gloom\r\nthe great decisive wave bearing down on them. How far was it going to\r\ndrag them? If the wave broke upon the ship, they were carried on the\r\nrock and dashed to pieces. If it passed under the ship....\r\n\r\nThe wave _did_ pass under.\r\n\r\nThey breathed again.\r\n\r\nBut what of the recoil? What would the surf do with them? The surf\r\ncarried them back. A few minutes later the _Matutina_ was free of the\r\nbreakers. The Ortach faded from their view, as the Caskets had done. It\r\nwas their second victory. For the second time the hooker had verged on\r\ndestruction, and had drawn back in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nPORTENTOSUM MARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a thickening mist had descended on the drifting wretches. They\r\nwere ignorant of their whereabouts, they could scarcely see a cable’s\r\nlength around. Despite a furious storm of hail which forced them to bend\r\ndown their heads, the women had obstinately refused to go below again.\r\nNo one, however hopeless, but wishes, if shipwreck be inevitable, to\r\nmeet it in the open air. When so near death, a ceiling above one’s head\r\nseems like the first outline of a coffin.\r\n\r\nThey were now in a short and chopping sea. A turgid sea indicates its\r\nconstraint. Even in a fog the entrance into a strait may be known by the\r\nboiling-like appearance of the waves. And thus it was, for they were\r\nunconsciously coasting Aurigny. Between the west of Ortach and the\r\nCaskets and the east of Aurigny the sea is hemmed in and cramped, and\r\nthe uneasy position determines locally the condition of storms. The sea\r\nsuffers like others, and when it suffers it is irritable. That channel\r\nis a thing to fear.\r\n\r\nThe _Matutina_ was in it.\r\n\r\nImagine under the sea a tortoise shell as big as Hyde Park or the Champs\r\nElysées, of which every striature is a shallow, and every embossment a\r\nreef. Such is the western approach of Aurigny. The sea covers and\r\nconceals this ship-wrecking apparatus. On this conglomeration of\r\nsubmarine breakers the cloven waves leap and foam--in calm weather, a\r\nchopping sea; in storms, a chaos.\r\n\r\nThe shipwrecked men observed this new complication without endeavouring\r\nto explain it to themselves. Suddenly they understood it. A pale vista\r\nbroadened in the zenith; a wan tinge overspread the sea; the livid light\r\nrevealed on the port side a long shoal stretching eastward, towards\r\nwhich the power of the rushing wind was driving the vessel. The shoal\r\nwas Aurigny.\r\n\r\nWhat was that shoal? They shuddered. They would have shuddered even more\r\nhad a voice answered them--Aurigny.\r\n\r\nNo isle so well defended against man’s approach as Aurigny. Below and\r\nabove water it is protected by a savage guard, of which Ortach is the\r\noutpost. To the west, Burhou, Sauteriaux, Anfroque, Niangle, Fond du\r\nCroc, Les Jumelles, La Grosse, La Clanque, Les Eguillons, Le Vrac, La\r\nFosse-Malière; to the east, Sauquet, Hommeau Floreau, La Brinebetais, La\r\nQueslingue, Croquelihou, La Fourche, Le Saut, Noire Pute, Coupie, Orbue.\r\nThese are hydra-monsters of the species reef.\r\n\r\nOne of these reefs is called Le But, the goal, as if to imply that every\r\nvoyage ends there.\r\n\r\nThis obstruction of rocks, simplified by night and sea, appeared to the\r\nshipwrecked men in the shape of a single dark band, a sort of black blot\r\non the horizon.\r\n\r\nShipwreck is the ideal of helplessness; to be near land, and unable to\r\nreach it; to float, yet not to be able to do so in any desired\r\ndirection; to rest the foot on what seems firm and is fragile; to be\r\nfull of life, when o’ershadowed by death; to be the prisoner of space;\r\nto be walled in between sky and ocean; to have the infinite overhead\r\nlike a dungeon; to be encompassed by the eluding elements of wind and\r\nwaves; and to be seized, bound, paralyzed--such a load of misfortune\r\nstupefies and crushes us. We imagine that in it we catch a glimpse of\r\nthe sneer of the opponent who is beyond our reach. That which holds you\r\nfast is that which releases the birds and sets the fishes free. It\r\nappears nothing, and is everything. We are dependent on the air which is\r\nruffled by our mouths; we are dependent on the water which we catch in\r\nthe hollow of our hands. Draw a glassful from the storm, and it is but a\r\ncup of bitterness--a mouthful is nausea, a waveful is extermination. The\r\ngrain of sand in the desert, the foam-flake on the sea, are fearful\r\nsymptoms. Omnipotence takes no care to hide its atom, it changes\r\nweakness into strength, fills naught with all; and it is with the\r\ninfinitely little that the infinitely great crushes you. It is with its\r\ndrops the ocean dissolves you. You feel you are a plaything.\r\n\r\nA plaything--ghastly epithet!\r\n\r\nThe _Matutina_ was a little above Aurigny, which was not an unfavourable\r\nposition; but she was drifting towards its northern point, which was\r\nfatal. As a bent bow discharges its arrow, the nor’-wester was shooting\r\nthe vessel towards the northern cape. Off that point, a little beyond\r\nthe harbour of Corbelets, is that which the seamen of the Norman\r\narchipelago call a “_singe_.”\r\n\r\nThe “_singe_,” or race, is a furious kind of current. A wreath of\r\nfunnels in the shallows produces in the waves a wreath of whirlpools.\r\nYou escape one to fall into another. A ship caught hold of by the race,\r\nwinds round and round until some sharp rock cleaves her hull; then the\r\nshattered vessel stops, her stern rises from the waves, the stem\r\ncompletes the revolution in the abyss, the stern sinks in, and all is\r\nsucked down. A circle of foam broadens and floats, and nothing more is\r\nseen on the surface of the waves but a few bubbles here and there rising\r\nfrom the smothered breathings below.\r\n\r\nThe three most dangerous races in the whole Channel are one close to the\r\nwell-known Girdler Sands, one at Jersey between the Pignonnet and the\r\nPoint of Noirmont, and the race of Aurigny.\r\n\r\nHad a local pilot been on board the _Matutina_, he could have warned\r\nthem of their fresh peril. In place of a pilot, they had their instinct.\r\nIn situations of extreme danger men are endowed with second sight. High\r\ncontortions of foam were flying along the coast in the frenzied raid of\r\nthe wind. It was the spitting of the race. Many a bark has been swamped\r\nin that snare. Without knowing what awaited them, they approached the\r\nspot with horror.\r\n\r\nHow to double that cape? There were no means of doing it.\r\n\r\nJust as they had seen, first the Caskets, then Ortach, rise before them,\r\nthey now saw the point of Aurigny, all of steep rock. It was like a\r\nnumber of giants, rising up one after another--a series of frightful\r\nduels.\r\n\r\nCharybdis and Scylla are but two; the Caskets, Ortach, and Aurigny are\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of the horizon being invaded by the rocks was thus\r\nrepeated with the grand monotony of the abyss. The battles of the ocean\r\nhave the same sublime tautology as the combats of Homer.\r\n\r\nEach wave, as they neared it, added twenty cubits to the cape, awfully\r\nmagnified by the mist; the fast decreasing distance seemed more\r\ninevitable--they were touching the skirts of the race! The first fold\r\nwhich seized them would drag them in--another wave surmounted, and all\r\nwould be over.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the hooker was driven back, as by the blow of a Titan’s fist.\r\nThe wave reared up under the vessel and fell back, throwing the waif\r\nback in its mane of foam. The _Matutina_, thus impelled, drifted away\r\nfrom Aurigny.\r\n\r\nShe was again on the open sea.\r\n\r\nWhence had come the succour? From the wind. The breath of the storm had\r\nchanged its direction.\r\n\r\nThe wave had played with them; now it was the wind’s turn. They had\r\nsaved themselves from the Caskets. Off Ortach it was the wave which had\r\nbeen their friend. Now it was the wind. The wind had suddenly veered\r\nfrom north to south. The sou’-wester had succeeded the nor’-wester.\r\n\r\nThe current is the wind in the waters; the wind is the current in the\r\nair. These two forces had just counteracted each other, and it had been\r\nthe wind’s will to snatch its prey from the current.\r\n\r\nThe sudden fantasies of ocean are uncertain. They are, perhaps, an\r\nembodiment of the perpetual, when at their mercy man must neither hope\r\nnor despair. They do and they undo. The ocean amuses itself. Every shade\r\nof wild, untamed ferocity is phased in the vastness of that cunning sea,\r\nwhich Jean Bart used to call the “great brute.” To its claws and their\r\ngashings succeed soft intervals of velvet paws. Sometimes the storm\r\nhurries on a wreck, at others it works out the problem with care; it\r\nmight almost be said that it caresses it. The sea can afford to take its\r\ntime, as men in their agonies find out.\r\n\r\nWe must own that occasionally these lulls of the torture announce\r\ndeliverance. Such cases are rare. However this may be, men in extreme\r\nperil are quick to believe in rescue; the slightest pause in the storm’s\r\nthreats is sufficient; they tell themselves that they are out of danger.\r\nAfter believing themselves buried, they declare their resurrection; they\r\nfeverishly embrace what they do not yet possess; it is clear that the\r\nbad luck has turned; they declare themselves satisfied; they are saved;\r\nthey cry quits with God. They should not be in so great a hurry to give\r\nreceipts to the Unknown.\r\n\r\nThe sou’-wester set in with a whirlwind. Shipwrecked men have never any\r\nbut rough helpers. The _Matutina_ was dragged rapidly out to sea by the\r\nremnant of her rigging--like a dead woman trailed by the hair. It was\r\nlike the enfranchisement granted by Tiberius, at the price of violation.\r\n\r\nThe wind treated with brutality those whom it saved; it rendered service\r\nwith fury; it was help without pity.\r\n\r\nThe wreck was breaking up under the severity of its deliverers.\r\n\r\nHailstones, big and hard enough to charge a blunderbuss, smote the\r\nvessel; at every rotation of the waves these hailstones rolled about the\r\ndeck like marbles. The hooker, whose deck was almost flush with the\r\nwater, was being beaten out of shape by the rolling masses of water and\r\nits sheets of spray. On board it each man was for himself.\r\n\r\nThey clung on as best they could. As each sea swept over them, it was\r\nwith a sense of surprise they saw that all were still there. Several had\r\ntheir faces torn by splinters.\r\n\r\nHappily despair has stout hands. In terror a child’s hand has the grasp\r\nof a giant. Agony makes a vice of a woman’s fingers. A girl in her\r\nfright can almost bury her rose-coloured fingers in a piece of iron.\r\nWith hooked fingers they hung on somehow, as the waves dashed on and\r\npassed off them; but every wave brought them the fear of being swept\r\naway.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they were relieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM SUDDENLY WORKS IN SILENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hurricane had just stopped short. There was no longer in the air\r\nsou’-wester or nor’-wester. The fierce clarions of space were mute. The\r\nwhole of the waterspout had poured from the sky without any warning of\r\ndiminution, as if it had slided perpendicularly into a gulf beneath.\r\nNone knew what had become of it; flakes replaced the hailstones, the\r\nsnow began to fall slowly. No more swell: the sea flattened down.\r\n\r\nSuch sudden cessations are peculiar to snowstorms. The electric\r\neffluvium exhausted, all becomes still, even the wave, which in ordinary\r\nstorms often remains agitated for a long time. In snowstorms it is not\r\nso. No prolonged anger in the deep. Like a tired-out worker it becomes\r\ndrowsy directly, thus almost giving the lie to the laws of statics, but\r\nnot astonishing old seamen, who know that the sea is full of unforeseen\r\nsurprises.\r\n\r\nThe same phenomenon takes place, although very rarely, in ordinary\r\nstorms. Thus, in our time, on the occasion of the memorable hurricane of\r\nJuly 27th, 1867, at Jersey the wind, after fourteen hours’ fury,\r\nsuddenly relapsed into a dead calm.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the hooker was floating in sleeping waters.\r\n\r\nAt the same time (for the last phase of these storms resembles the\r\nfirst) they could distinguish nothing; all that had been made visible in\r\nthe convulsions of the meteoric cloud was again dark. Pale outlines\r\nwere fused in vague mist, and the gloom of infinite space closed about\r\nthe vessel. The wall of night--that circular occlusion, that interior of\r\na cylinder the diameter of which was lessening minute by\r\nminute--enveloped the _Matutina_, and, with the sinister deliberation of\r\nan encroaching iceberg, was drawing in dangerously. In the zenith\r\nnothing--a lid of fog closing down. It was as if the hooker were at the\r\nbottom of the well of the abyss.\r\n\r\nIn that well the sea was a puddle of liquid lead. No stir in the\r\nwaters--ominous immobility! The ocean is never less tamed than when it\r\nis still as a pool.\r\n\r\nAll was silence, stillness, blindness.\r\n\r\nPerchance the silence of inanimate objects is taciturnity.\r\n\r\nThe last ripples glided along the hull. The deck was horizontal, with an\r\ninsensible slope to the sides. Some broken planks were shifting about\r\nirresolutely. The block on which they had lighted the tow steeped in\r\ntar, in place of the signal light which had been swept away, swung no\r\nlonger at the prow, and no longer let fall burning drops into the sea.\r\nWhat little breeze remained in the clouds was noiseless. The snow fell\r\nthickly, softly, with scarce a slant. No foam of breakers could be\r\nheard. The peace of shadows was over all.\r\n\r\nThis repose succeeding all the past exasperations and paroxysms was, for\r\nthe poor creatures so long tossed about, an unspeakable comfort. It was\r\nas though the punishment of the rack had ceased. They caught a glimpse\r\nabout them and above them of something which seemed like a consent, that\r\nthey should be saved. They regained confidence. All that had been fury\r\nwas now tranquillity. It appeared to them a pledge of peace. Their\r\nwretched hearts dilated. They were able to let go the end of rope or\r\nbeam to which they had clung, to rise, hold themselves up, stand, walk,\r\nmove about. They felt inexpressibly calmed. There are in the depths of\r\ndarkness such phases of paradise, preparations for other things. It was\r\nclear that they were delivered out of the storm, out of the foam, out of\r\nthe wind, out of the uproar. Henceforth all the chances were in their\r\nfavour. In three or four hours it would be sunrise. They would be seen\r\nby some passing ship; they would be rescued. The worst was over; they\r\nwere re-entering life. The important feat was to have been able to keep\r\nafloat until the cessation of the tempest. They said to themselves, “It\r\nis all over this time.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly they found that all was indeed over.\r\n\r\nOne of the sailors, the northern Basque, Galdeazun by name, went down\r\ninto the hold to look for a rope, then came above again and said,--\r\n\r\n“The hold is full.”\r\n\r\n“Of what?” asked the chief.\r\n\r\n“Of water,” answered the sailor.\r\n\r\nThe chief cried out,--\r\n\r\n“What does that mean?”\r\n\r\n“It means,” replied Galdeazun, “that in half an hour we shall founder.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST RESOURCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a hole in the keel. A leak had been sprung. When it happened\r\nno one could have said. Was it when they touched the Caskets? Was it off\r\nOrtach? Was it when they were whirled about the shallows west of\r\nAurigny? It was most probable that they had touched some rock there.\r\nThey had struck against some hidden buttress which they had not felt in\r\nthe midst of the convulsive fury of the wind which was tossing them. In\r\ntetanus who would feel a prick?\r\n\r\nThe other sailor, the southern Basque, whose name was Ave Maria, went\r\ndown into the hold, too, came on deck again, and said,--\r\n\r\n“There are two varas of water in the hold.”\r\n\r\nAbout six feet.\r\n\r\nAve Maria added, “In less than forty minutes we shall sink.”\r\n\r\nWhere was the leak? They couldn’t find it. It was hidden by the water\r\nwhich was filling up the hold. The vessel had a hole in her hull\r\nsomewhere under the water-line, quite forward in the keel. Impossible to\r\nfind it--impossible to check it. They had a wound which they could not\r\nstanch. The water, however, was not rising very fast.\r\n\r\nThe chief called out,\r\n\r\n“We must work the pump.”\r\n\r\nGaldeazun replied, “We have no pump left.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said the chief, “we must make for land.”\r\n\r\n“Where is the land?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I.”\r\n\r\n“But it must be somewhere.”\r\n\r\n“True enough.”\r\n\r\n“Let some one steer for it.”\r\n\r\n“We have no pilot.”\r\n\r\n“Stand to the tiller yourself.”\r\n\r\n“We have lost the tiller.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s rig one out of the first beam we can lay hands on. Nails--a\r\nhammer--quick--some tools.”\r\n\r\n“The carpenter’s box is overboard, we have no tools.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll steer all the same, no matter where.”\r\n\r\n“The rudder is lost.”\r\n\r\n“Where is the boat? We’ll get in and row.”\r\n\r\n“The boat is lost.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll row the wreck.”\r\n\r\n“We have lost the oars.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll sail.”\r\n\r\n“We have lost the sails and the mast.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll rig one up with a pole and a tarpaulin for sail Let’s get clear\r\nof this and trust in the wind.”\r\n\r\n“There is no wind.”\r\n\r\nThe wind, indeed, had left them, the storm had fled; and its departure,\r\nwhich they had believed to mean safety, meant, in fact, destruction. Had\r\nthe sou’-wester continued it might have driven them wildly on some\r\nshore--might have beaten the leak in speed--might, perhaps, have carried\r\nthem to some propitious sandbank, and cast them on it before the hooker\r\nfoundered. The swiftness of the storm, bearing them away, might have\r\nenabled them to reach land; but no more wind, no more hope. They were\r\ngoing to die because the hurricane was over.\r\n\r\nThe end was near!\r\n\r\nWind, hail, the hurricane, the whirlwind--these are wild combatants that\r\nmay be overcome; the storm can be taken in the weak point of its armour;\r\nthere are resources against the violence which continually lays itself\r\nopen, is off its guard, and often hits wide. But nothing is to be done\r\nagainst a calm; it offers nothing to the grasp of which you can lay\r\nhold.\r\n\r\nThe winds are a charge of Cossacks: stand your ground and they disperse.\r\nCalms are the pincers of the executioner.\r\n\r\nThe water, deliberate and sure, irrepressible and heavy, rose in the\r\nhold, and as it rose the vessel sank--it was happening slowly.\r\n\r\nThose on board the wreck of the _Matutina_ felt that most hopeless of\r\ncatastrophes--an inert catastrophe undermining them. The still and\r\nsinister certainty of their fate petrified them. No stir in the air, no\r\nmovement on the sea. The motionless is the inexorable. Absorption was\r\nsucking them down silently. Through the depths of the dumb\r\nwaters--without anger, without passion, not willing, not knowing, not\r\ncaring--the fatal centre of the globe was attracting them downwards.\r\nHorror in repose amalgamating them with itself. It was no longer the\r\nwide open mouth of the sea, the double jaw of the wind and the wave,\r\nvicious in its threat, the grin of the waterspout, the foaming appetite\r\nof the breakers--it was as if the wretched beings had under them the\r\nblack yawn of the infinite.\r\n\r\nThey felt themselves sinking into Death’s peaceful depths. The height\r\nbetween the vessel and the water was lessening--that was all. They could\r\ncalculate her disappearance to the moment. It was the exact reverse of\r\nsubmersion by the rising tide. The water was not rising towards them;\r\nthey were sinking towards it. They were digging their own grave. Their\r\nown weight was their sexton.\r\n\r\nThey were being executed, not by the law of man, but by the law of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThe snow was falling, and as the wreck was now motionless, this white\r\nlint made a cloth over the deck and covered the vessel as with a\r\nwinding-sheet.\r\n\r\nThe hold was becoming fuller and deeper--no means of getting at the\r\nleak. They struck a light and fixed three or four torches in holes as\r\nbest they could. Galdeazun brought some old leathern buckets, and they\r\ntried to bale the hold out, standing in a row to pass them from hand to\r\nhand; but the buckets were past use, the leather of some was unstitched,\r\nthere were holes in the bottoms of the others, and the buckets emptied\r\nthemselves on the way. The difference in quantity between the water\r\nwhich was making its way in and that which they returned to the sea was\r\nludicrous--for a ton that entered a glassful was baled out; they did not\r\nimprove their condition. It was like the expenditure of a miser, trying\r\nto exhaust a million, halfpenny by halfpenny.\r\n\r\nThe chief said, “Let us lighten the wreck.”\r\n\r\nDuring the storm they had lashed together the few chests which were on\r\ndeck. These remained tied to the stump of the mast. They undid the\r\nlashings and rolled the chests overboard through a breach in the\r\ngunwale. One of these trunks belonged to the Basque woman, who could not\r\nrepress a sigh.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my new cloak lined with scarlet! Oh, my poor stockings of\r\nbirchen-bark lace! Oh, my silver ear-rings to wear at mass on May Day!”\r\n\r\nThe deck cleared, there remained the cabin to be seen to. It was greatly\r\nencumbered; in it were, as may be remembered, the luggage belonging to\r\nthe passengers, and the bales belonging to the sailors. They took the\r\nluggage, and threw it over the gunwale. They carried up the bales and\r\ncast them into the sea.\r\n\r\nThus they emptied the cabin. The lantern, the cap, the barrels, the\r\nsacks, the bales, and the water-butts, the pot of soup, all went over\r\ninto the waves.\r\n\r\nThey unscrewed the nuts of the iron stove, long since extinguished:\r\nthey pulled it out, hoisted it on deck, dragged it to the side, and\r\nthrew it out of the vessel.\r\n\r\nThey cast overboard everything they could pull out of the deck--chains,\r\nshrouds, and torn rigging.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the chief took a torch, and throwing its light on the\r\nfigures painted on the prow to show the draught of water, looked to see\r\nhow deep the wreck had settled down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE HIGHEST RESOURCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wreck being lightened, was sinking more slowly, but none the less\r\nsurely.\r\n\r\nThe hopelessness of their situation was without resource--without\r\nmitigation; they had exhausted their last expedient.\r\n\r\n“Is there anything else we can throw overboard?”\r\n\r\nThe doctor, whom every one had forgotten, rose from the companion, and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What?” asked the chief.\r\n\r\nThe doctor answered, “Our Crime.”\r\n\r\nThey shuddered, and all cried out,--\r\n\r\n“Amen.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor standing up, pale, raised his hand to heaven, saying,--\r\n\r\n“Kneel down.”\r\n\r\nThey wavered--to waver is the preface to kneeling down.\r\n\r\nThe doctor went on,--\r\n\r\n“Let us throw our crimes into the sea, they weigh us down; it is they\r\nthat are sinking the ship. Let us think no more of safety--let us think\r\nof salvation. Our last crime, above all, the crime which we committed,\r\nor rather completed, just now--O wretched beings who are listening to\r\nme--it is that which is overwhelming us. For those who leave intended\r\nmurder behind them, it is an impious insolence to tempt the abyss. He\r\nwho sins against a child, sins against God. True, we were obliged to put\r\nto sea, but it was certain perdition. The storm, warned by the shadow of\r\nour crime, came on. It is well. Regret nothing, however. There, not far\r\noff in the darkness, are the sands of Vauville and Cape la Hogue. It is\r\nFrance. There was but one possible shelter for us, which was Spain.\r\nFrance is no less dangerous to us than England. Our deliverance from the\r\nsea would have led but to the gibbet. Hanged or drowned--we had no\r\nalternative. God has chosen for us; let us give Him thanks. He has\r\nvouchsafed us the grave which cleanses. Brethren, the inevitable hand is\r\nin it. Remember that it was we who just now did our best to send on high\r\nthat child, and that at this very moment, now as I speak, there is\r\nperhaps, above our heads, a soul accusing us before a Judge whose eye is\r\non us. Let us make the best use of this last respite; let us make an\r\neffort, if we still may, to repair, as far as we are able, the evil that\r\nwe have wrought. If the child survives us, let us come to his aid; if he\r\nis dead, let us seek his forgiveness. Let us cast our crime from us. Let\r\nus ease our consciences of its weight. Let us strive that our souls be\r\nnot swallowed up before God, for that is the awful shipwreck. Bodies go\r\nto the fishes, souls to the devils. Have pity on yourselves. Kneel down,\r\nI tell you. Repentance is the bark which never sinks. You have lost your\r\ncompass! You are wrong! You still have prayer.”\r\n\r\nThe wolves became lambs--such transformations occur in last agonies;\r\ntigers lick the crucifix; when the dark portal opens ajar, belief is\r\ndifficult, unbelief impossible. However imperfect may be the different\r\nsketches of religion essayed by man, even when his belief is shapeless,\r\neven when the outline of the dogma is not in harmony with the lineaments\r\nof the eternity he foresees, there comes in his last hour a trembling of\r\nthe soul. There is something which will begin when life is over; this\r\nthought impresses the last pang.\r\n\r\nA man’s dying agony is the expiration of a term. In that fatal second he\r\nfeels weighing on him a diffused responsibility. That which has been\r\ncomplicates that which is to be. The past returns and enters into the\r\nfuture. What is known becomes as much an abyss as the unknown. And the\r\ntwo chasms, the one which is full by his faults, the other of his\r\nanticipations, mingle their reverberations. It is this confusion of the\r\ntwo gulfs which terrifies the dying man.\r\n\r\nThey had spent their last grain of hope on the direction of life; hence\r\nthey turned in the other. Their only remaining chance was in its dark\r\nshadow. They understood it. It came on them as a lugubrious flash,\r\nfollowed by the relapse of horror. That which is intelligible to the\r\ndying man is as what is perceived in the lightning. Everything, then\r\nnothing; you see, then all is blindness. After death the eye will\r\nreopen, and that which was a flash will become a sun.\r\n\r\nThey cried out to the doctor,--\r\n\r\n“Thou, thou, there is no one but thee. We will obey thee, what must we\r\ndo? Speak.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor answered,--\r\n\r\n“The question is how to pass over the unknown precipice and reach the\r\nother bank of life, which is beyond the tomb. Being the one who knows\r\nthe most, my danger is greater than yours. You do well to leave the\r\nchoice of the bridge to him whose burden is the heaviest.”\r\n\r\nHe added,--\r\n\r\n“Knowledge is a weight added to conscience.”\r\n\r\nHe continued,--\r\n\r\n“How much time have we still?”\r\n\r\nGaldeazun looked at the water-mark, and answered,--\r\n\r\n“A little more than a quarter of an hour.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe low hood of the companion on which he leant his elbows made a sort\r\nof table; the doctor took from his pocket his inkhorn and pen, and his\r\npocket-book out of which he drew a parchment, the same one on the back\r\nof which he had written, a few hours before, some twenty cramped and\r\ncrooked lines.\r\n\r\n“A light,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe snow, falling like the spray of a cataract, had extinguished the\r\ntorches one after another; there was but one left. Ave Maria took it out\r\nof the place where it had been stuck, and holding it in his hand, came\r\nand stood by the doctor’s side.\r\n\r\nThe doctor replaced his pocket-book in his pocket, put down the pen and\r\ninkhorn on the hood of the companion, unfolded the parchment, and\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n“Listen.”\r\n\r\nThen in the midst of the sea, on the failing bridge (a sort of\r\nshuddering flooring of the tomb), the doctor began a solemn reading, to\r\nwhich all the shadows seemed to listen. The doomed men bowed their heads\r\naround him. The flaming of the torch intensified their pallor. What the\r\ndoctor read was written in English. Now and then, when one of those\r\nwoebegone looks seemed to ask an explanation, the doctor would stop, to\r\nrepeat--whether in French, or Spanish, Basque, or Italian--the passage\r\nhe had just read. Stifled sobs and hollow beatings of the breast were\r\nheard. The wreck was sinking more and more.\r\n\r\nThe reading over, the doctor placed the parchment flat on the companion,\r\nseized his pen, and on a clear margin which he had carefully left at the\r\nbottom of what he had written, he signed himself, GERNARDUS GEESTEMUNDE:\r\nDoctor.\r\n\r\nThen, turning towards the others, he said,--\r\n\r\n“Come, and sign.”\r\n\r\nThe Basque woman approached, took the pen, and signed herself, ASUNCION.\r\n\r\nShe handed the pen to the Irish woman, who, not knowing how to write,\r\nmade a cross.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, by the side of this cross, wrote, BARBARA FERMOY, _of Tyrrif\r\nIsland, in the Hebrides_.\r\n\r\nThen he handed the pen to the chief of the band.\r\n\r\nThe chief signed, GAIZDORRA: _Captal_.\r\n\r\nThe Genoese signed himself under the chief’s name. GIANGIRATE.\r\n\r\nThe Languedocian signed, JACQUES QUARTOURZE: _alias, the Narbonnais_.\r\n\r\nThe Provençal signed, LUC-PIERRE CAPGAROUPE, _of the Galleys of Mahon_.\r\n\r\nUnder these signatures the doctor added a note:--\r\n\r\n“Of the crew of three men, the skipper having been washed overboard by a\r\nsea, but two remain, and they have signed.”\r\n\r\nThe two sailors affixed their names underneath the note. The northern\r\nBasque signed himself, GALDEAZUN.\r\n\r\nThe southern Basque signed, AVE MARIA: _Robber_.\r\n\r\nThen the doctor said,--\r\n\r\n“Capgaroupe.”\r\n\r\n“Here,” said the Provençal.\r\n\r\n“Have you Hardquanonne’s flask?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Give it me.”\r\n\r\nCapgaroupe drank off the last mouthful of brandy, and handed the flask\r\nto the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe water was rising in the hold; the wreck was sinking deeper and\r\ndeeper into the sea. The sloping edges of the ship were covered by a\r\nthin gnawing wave, which was rising. All were crowded on the centre of\r\nthe deck.\r\n\r\nThe doctor dried the ink on the signatures by the heat of the torch, and\r\nfolding the parchment into a narrower compass than the diameter of the\r\nneck, put it into the flask. He called for the cork.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know where it is,” said Capgaroupe.\r\n\r\n“Here is a piece of rope,” said Jacques Quartourze.\r\n\r\nThe doctor corked the flask with a bit of rope, and asked for some tar.\r\nGaldeazun went forward, extinguished the signal light with a piece of\r\ntow, took the vessel in which it was contained from the stern, and\r\nbrought it, half full of burning tar, to the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe flask holding the parchment which they had all signed was corked and\r\ntarred over.\r\n\r\n“It is done,” said the doctor.\r\n\r\nAnd from out all their mouths, vaguely stammered in every language, came\r\nthe dismal utterances of the catacombs.\r\n\r\n“Ainsi soit-il!”\r\n\r\n“Mea culpa!”\r\n\r\n“Asi sea!”\r\n\r\n“Aro raï!”\r\n\r\n“Amen!”\r\n\r\nIt was as though the sombre voices of Babel were scattered through the\r\nshadows as Heaven uttered its awful refusal to hear them.\r\n\r\nThe doctor turned away from his companions in crime and distress, and\r\ntook a few steps towards the gunwale. Reaching the side, he looked into\r\nspace, and said, in a deep voice,--\r\n\r\n“Bist du bei mir?”[8]\r\n\r\nPerchance he was addressing some phantom.\r\n\r\nThe wreck was sinking.\r\n\r\nBehind the doctor all the others were in a dream. Prayer mastered them\r\nby main force. They did not bow, they were bent. There was something\r\ninvoluntary in their condition; they wavered as a sail flaps when the\r\nbreeze fails. And the haggard group took by degrees, with clasping of\r\nhands and prostration of foreheads, attitudes various, yet of\r\nhumiliation. Some strange reflection of the deep seemed to soften their\r\nvillainous features.\r\n\r\nThe doctor returned towards them. Whatever had been his past, the old\r\nman was great in the presence of the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe deep reserve of nature which enveloped him preoccupied without\r\ndisconcerting him. He was not one to be taken unawares. Over him was the\r\ncalm of a silent horror: on his countenance the majesty of God’s will\r\ncomprehended.\r\n\r\nThis old and thoughtful outlaw unconsciously assumed the air of a\r\npontiff.\r\n\r\nHe said,--\r\n\r\n“Attend to me.”\r\n\r\nHe contemplated for a moment the waste of water, and added,--\r\n\r\n“Now we are going to die.”\r\n\r\nThen he took the torch from the hands of Ave Maria, and waved it.\r\n\r\nA spark broke from it and flew into the night.\r\n\r\nThen the doctor cast the torch into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe torch was extinguished: all light disappeared. Nothing left but the\r\nhuge, unfathomable shadow. It was like the filling up of the grave.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness the doctor was heard saying,--\r\n\r\n“Let us pray.”\r\n\r\nAll knelt down.\r\n\r\nIt was no longer on the snow, but in the water, that they knelt.\r\n\r\nThey had but a few minutes more.\r\n\r\nThe doctor alone remained standing.\r\n\r\nThe flakes of snow falling on him had sprinkled him with white tears,\r\nand made him visible on the background of darkness. He might have been\r\nthe speaking statue of the shadow.\r\n\r\nThe doctor made the sign of the cross and raised his voice, while\r\nbeneath his feet he felt that almost imperceptible oscillation which\r\nprefaces the moment in which a wreck is about to founder. He said,--\r\n\r\n“Pater noster qui es in coelis.”\r\n\r\nThe Provençal repeated in French,--\r\n\r\n“Notre Père qui êtes aux cieux.”\r\n\r\nThe Irishwoman repeated in Gaelic, understood by the Basque woman,--\r\n\r\n“Ar nathair ata ar neamh.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor continued,--\r\n\r\n“Sanctificetur nomen tuum.”\r\n\r\n“Que votre nom soit sanctifié,” said the Provençal.\r\n\r\n“Naomhthar hainm,” said the Irishwoman.\r\n\r\n“Adveniat regnum tuum,” continued the doctor.\r\n\r\n“Que votre règne arrive,” said the Provençal.\r\n\r\n“Tigeadh do rioghachd,” said the Irishwoman.\r\n\r\nAs they knelt, the waters had risen to their shoulders. The doctor went\r\non,--\r\n\r\n“Fiat voluntas tua.”\r\n\r\n“Que votre volonté soit faite,” stammered the Provençal.\r\n\r\nAnd the Irishwoman and Basque woman cried,--\r\n\r\n“Deuntar do thoil ar an Hhalàmb.”\r\n\r\n“Sicut in coelo, sicut in terra,” said the doctor.\r\n\r\nNo voice answered him.\r\n\r\nHe looked down. All their heads were under water. They had let\r\nthemselves be drowned on their knees.\r\n\r\nThe doctor took in his right hand the flask which he had placed on the\r\ncompanion, and raised it above his head.\r\n\r\nThe wreck was going down. As he sank, the doctor murmured the rest of\r\nthe prayer.\r\n\r\nFor an instant his shoulders were above water, then his head, then\r\nnothing remained but his arm holding up the flask, as if he were showing\r\nit to the Infinite.\r\n\r\nHis arm disappeared; there was no greater fold on the deep sea than\r\nthere would have been on a tun of oil. The snow continued falling.\r\n\r\nOne thing floated, and was carried by the waves into the darkness. It\r\nwas the tarred flask, kept afloat by its osier cover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE THIRD.\r\n\r\n_THE CHILD IN THE SHADOW_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nCHESIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm was no less severe on land than on sea. The same wild\r\nenfranchisement of the elements had taken place around the abandoned\r\nchild. The weak and innocent become their sport in the expenditure of\r\nthe unreasoning rage of their blind forces. Shadows discern not, and\r\nthings inanimate have not the clemency they are supposed to possess.\r\n\r\nOn the land there was but little wind. There was an inexplicable\r\ndumbness in the cold. There was no hail. The thickness of the falling\r\nsnow was fearful.\r\n\r\nHailstones strike, harass, bruise, stun, crush. Snowflakes do worse:\r\nsoft and inexorable, the snowflake does its work in silence; touch it,\r\nand it melts. It is pure, even as the hypocrite is candid. It is by\r\nwhite particles slowly heaped upon each other that the flake becomes an\r\navalanche and the knave a criminal.\r\n\r\nThe child continued to advance into the mist. The fog presents but a\r\nsoft obstacle; hence its danger. It yields, and yet persists. Mist, like\r\nsnow, is full of treachery. The child, strange wrestler at war with all\r\nthese risks, had succeeded in reaching the bottom of the descent, and\r\nhad gained Chesil. Without knowing it he was on an isthmus, with the\r\nocean on each side; so that he could not lose his way in the fog, in the\r\nsnow, or in the darkness, without falling into the deep waters of the\r\ngulf on the right hand, or into the raging billows of the high sea on\r\nthe left. He was travelling on, in ignorance, between these two abysses.\r\n\r\nThe Isthmus of Portland was at this period singularly sharp and rugged.\r\nNothing remains at this date of its past configuration. Since the idea\r\nof manufacturing Portland stone into Roman cement was first seized, the\r\nwhole rock has been subjected to an alteration which has completely\r\nchanged its original appearance. Calcareous lias, slate, and trap are\r\nstill to be found there, rising from layers of conglomerate, like teeth\r\nfrom a gum; but the pickaxe has broken up and levelled those bristling,\r\nrugged peaks which were once the fearful perches of the ossifrage. The\r\nsummits exist no longer where the labbes and the skua gulls used to\r\nflock together, soaring, like the envious, to sully high places. In vain\r\nmight you seek the tall monolith called Godolphin, an old British word,\r\nsignifying “white eagle.” In summer you may still gather on those\r\nsurfaces, pierced and perforated like a sponge, rosemary, pennyroyal,\r\nwild hyssop, and sea-fennel which when infused makes a good cordial, and\r\nthat herb full of knots, which grows in the sand and from which they\r\nmake matting; but you no longer find gray amber, or black tin, or that\r\ntriple species of slate--one sort green, one blue, and the third the\r\ncolour of sage-leaves. The foxes, the badgers, the otters, and the\r\nmartens have taken themselves off; on the cliffs of Portland, as well as\r\nat the extremity of Cornwall, where there were at one time chamois, none\r\nremain. They still fish in some inlets for plaice and pilchards; but the\r\nscared salmon no longer ascend the Wey, between Michaelmas and\r\nChristmas, to spawn. No more are seen there, as during the reign of\r\nElizabeth, those old unknown birds as large as hawks, who could cut an\r\napple in two, but ate only the pips. You never meet those crows with\r\nyellow beaks, called Cornish choughs in English, _pyrrocorax_ in Latin,\r\nwho, in their mischief, would drop burning twigs on thatched roofs. Nor\r\nthat magic bird, the fulmar, a wanderer from the Scottish archipelago,\r\ndropping from his bill an oil which the islanders used to burn in their\r\nlamps. Nor do you ever find in the evening, in the plash of the ebbing\r\ntide, that ancient, legendary neitse, with the feet of a hog and the\r\nbleat of a calf. The tide no longer throws up the whiskered seal, with\r\nits curled ears and sharp jaws, dragging itself along on its nailless\r\npaws. On that Portland--nowadays so changed as scarcely to be\r\nrecognized--the absence of forests precluded nightingales; but now the\r\nfalcon, the swan, and the wild goose have fled. The sheep of Portland,\r\nnowadays, are fat and have fine wool; the few scattered ewes, which\r\nnibbled the salt grass there two centuries ago, were small and tough and\r\ncoarse in the fleece, as became Celtic flocks brought there by\r\ngarlic-eating shepherds, who lived to a hundred, and who, at the\r\ndistance of half a mile, could pierce a cuirass with their yard-long\r\narrows. Uncultivated land makes coarse wool. The Chesil of to-day\r\nresembles in no particular the Chesil of the past, so much has it been\r\ndisturbed by man and by those furious winds which gnaw the very stones.\r\n\r\nAt present this tongue of land bears a railway, terminating in a pretty\r\nsquare of houses, called Chesilton, and there is a Portland station.\r\nRailway carriages roll where seals used to crawl.\r\n\r\nThe Isthmus of Portland two hundred years ago was a back of sand, with a\r\nvertebral spine of rock.\r\n\r\nThe child’s danger changed its form. What he had had to fear in the\r\ndescent was falling to the bottom of the precipice; in the isthmus, it\r\nwas falling into the holes. After dealing with the precipice, he must\r\ndeal with the pitfalls. Everything on the sea-shore is a trap--the rock\r\nis slippery, the strand is quicksand. Resting-places are but snares. It\r\nis walking on ice which may suddenly crack and yawn with a fissure,\r\nthrough which you disappear. The ocean has false stages below, like a\r\nwell-arranged theatre.\r\n\r\nThe long backbone of granite, from which fall away both slopes of the\r\nisthmus, is awkward of access. It is difficult to find there what, in\r\nscene-shifters’ language, are termed _practicables_. Man has no\r\nhospitality to hope for from the ocean; from the rock no more than from\r\nthe wave. The sea is provident for the bird and the fish alone.\r\nIsthmuses are especially naked and rugged; the wave, which wears and\r\nmines them on either side, reduces them to the simplest form. Everywhere\r\nthere were sharp relief ridges, cuttings, frightful fragments of torn\r\nstone, yawning with many points, like the jaws of a shark; breaknecks of\r\nwet moss, rapid slopes of rock ending in the sea. Whosoever undertakes\r\nto pass over an isthmus meets at every step misshapen blocks, as large\r\nas houses, in the forms of shin-bones, shoulder-blades, and\r\nthigh-bones, the hideous anatomy of dismembered rocks. It is not\r\nwithout reason that these _striæ_ of the sea-shore are called\r\n_côtes_.[9]\r\n\r\nThe wayfarer must get out as he best can from the confusion of these\r\nruins. It is like journeying over the bones of an enormous skeleton.\r\n\r\nPut a child to this labour of Hercules.\r\n\r\nBroad daylight might have aided him. It was night. A guide was\r\nnecessary. He was alone. All the vigour of manhood would not have been\r\ntoo much. He had but the feeble strength of a child. In default of a\r\nguide, a footpath might have aided him; there was none.\r\n\r\nBy instinct he avoided the sharp ridge of the rocks, and kept to the\r\nstrand as much as possible. It was there that he met with the pitfalls.\r\nThey were multiplied before him under three forms: the pitfall of water,\r\nthe pitfall of snow, and the pitfall of sand. This last is the most\r\ndangerous of all, because the most illusory. To know the peril we face\r\nis alarming; to be ignorant of it is terrible. The child was fighting\r\nagainst unknown dangers. He was groping his way through something which\r\nmight, perhaps, be the grave.\r\n\r\nHe did not hesitate. He went round the rocks, avoided the crevices,\r\nguessed at the pitfalls, obeyed the twistings and turnings caused by\r\nsuch obstacles, yet he went on. Though unable to advance in a straight\r\nline, he walked with a firm step. When necessary, he drew back with\r\nenergy. He knew how to tear himself in time from the horrid bird-lime of\r\nthe quicksands. He shook the snow from about him. He entered the water\r\nmore than once up to the knees. Directly that he left it, his wet knees\r\nwere frozen by the intense cold of the night. He walked rapidly in his\r\nstiffened garments; yet he took care to keep his sailor’s coat dry and\r\nwarm on his chest. He was still tormented by hunger.\r\n\r\nThe chances of the abyss are illimitable. Everything is possible in it,\r\neven salvation. The issue may be found, though it be invisible. How the\r\nchild, wrapped in a smothering winding-sheet of snow, lost on a narrow\r\nelevation between two jaws of an abyss, managed to cross the isthmus is\r\nwhat he could not himself have explained. He had slipped, climbed,\r\nrolled, searched, walked, persevered, that is all. Such is the secret of\r\nall triumphs. At the end of somewhat less than half an hour he felt\r\nthat the ground was rising. He had reached the other shore. Leaving\r\nChesil, he had gained terra firma.\r\n\r\nThe bridge which now unites Sandford Castle with Smallmouth Sands did\r\nnot then exist. It is probable that in his intelligent groping he had\r\nreascended as far as Wyke Regis, where there was then a tongue of sand,\r\na natural road crossing East Fleet.\r\n\r\nHe was saved from the isthmus; but he found himself again face to face\r\nwith the tempest, with the cold, with the night.\r\n\r\nBefore him once more lay the plain, shapeless in the density of\r\nimpenetrable shadow. He examined the ground, seeking a footpath.\r\nSuddenly he bent down. He had discovered, in the snow, something which\r\nseemed to him a track.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a track--the print of a foot. The print was cut out\r\nclearly in the whiteness of the snow, which rendered it distinctly\r\nvisible. He examined it. It was a naked foot; too small for that of a\r\nman, too large for that of a child.\r\n\r\nIt was probably the foot of a woman. Beyond that mark was another, then\r\nanother, then another. The footprints followed each other at the\r\ndistance of a step, and struck across the plain to the right. They were\r\nstill fresh, and slightly covered with little snow. A woman had just\r\npassed that way.\r\n\r\nThis woman was walking in the direction in which the child had seen the\r\nsmoke. With his eyes fixed on the footprints, he set himself to follow\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT OF SNOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe journeyed some time along this course. Unfortunately the footprints\r\nwere becoming less and less distinct. Dense and fearful was the falling\r\nof the snow. It was the time when the hooker was so distressed by the\r\nsnow-storm at sea.\r\n\r\nThe child, in distress like the vessel, but after another fashion, had,\r\nin the inextricable intersection of shadows which rose up before him, no\r\nresource but the footsteps in the snow, and he held to it as the thread\r\nof a labyrinth.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, whether the snow had filled them up or for some other reason,\r\nthe footsteps ceased. All became even, level, smooth, without a stain,\r\nwithout a detail. There was now nothing but a white cloth drawn over the\r\nearth and a black one over the sky. It seemed as if the foot-passenger\r\nhad flown away. The child, in despair, bent down and searched; but in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nAs he arose he had a sensation of hearing some indistinct sound, but he\r\ncould not be sure of it. It resembled a voice, a breath, a shadow. It\r\nwas more human than animal; more sepulchral than living. It was a sound,\r\nbut the sound of a dream.\r\n\r\nHe looked, but saw nothing.\r\n\r\nSolitude, wide, naked and livid, was before him. He listened. That which\r\nhe had thought he heard had faded away. Perhaps it had been but fancy.\r\nHe still listened. All was silent.\r\n\r\nThere was illusion in the mist.\r\n\r\nHe went on his way again. He walked forward at random, with nothing\r\nhenceforth to guide him.\r\n\r\nAs he moved away the noise began again. This time he could doubt it no\r\nlonger. It was a groan, almost a sob.\r\n\r\nHe turned. He searched the darkness of space with his eyes. He saw\r\nnothing. The sound arose once more. If limbo could cry out, it would cry\r\nin such a tone.\r\n\r\nNothing so penetrating, so piercing, so feeble as the voice--for it was\r\na voice. It arose from a soul. There was palpitation in the murmur.\r\nNevertheless, it seemed uttered almost unconsciously. It was an appeal\r\nof suffering, not knowing that it suffered or that it appealed.\r\n\r\nThe cry--perhaps a first breath, perhaps a last sigh--was equally\r\ndistant from the rattle which closes life and the wail with which it\r\ncommences. It breathed, it was stifled, it wept, a gloomy supplication\r\nfrom the depths of night. The child fixed his attention everywhere, far,\r\nnear, on high, below. There was no one. There was nothing. He listened.\r\nThe voice arose again. He perceived it distinctly. The sound somewhat\r\nresembled the bleating of a lamb.\r\n\r\nThen he was frightened, and thought of flight.\r\n\r\nThe groan again. This was the fourth time. It was strangely miserable\r\nand plaintive. One felt that after that last effort, more mechanical\r\nthan voluntary, the cry would probably be extinguished. It was an\r\nexpiring exclamation, instinctively appealing to the amount of aid held\r\nin suspense in space. It was some muttering of agony, addressed to a\r\npossible Providence.\r\n\r\nThe child approached in the direction from whence the sound came.\r\n\r\nStill he saw nothing.\r\n\r\nHe advanced again, watchfully.\r\n\r\nThe complaint continued. Inarticulate and confused as it was, it had\r\nbecome clear--almost vibrating. The child was near the voice; but where\r\nwas it?\r\n\r\nHe was close to a complaint. The trembling of a cry passed by his side\r\ninto space. A human moan floated away into the darkness. This was what\r\nhe had met. Such at least was his impression, dim as the dense mist in\r\nwhich he was lost.\r\n\r\nWhilst he hesitated between an instinct which urged him to fly and an\r\ninstinct which commanded him to remain, he perceived in the snow at his\r\nfeet, a few steps before him, a sort of undulation of the dimensions of\r\na human body--a little eminence, low, long, and narrow, like the mould\r\nover a grave--a sepulchre in a white churchyard.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the voice cried out. It was from beneath the undulation\r\nthat it proceeded. The child bent down, crouching before the undulation,\r\nand with both his hands began to clear it away.\r\n\r\nBeneath the snow which he removed a form grew under his hands; and\r\nsuddenly in the hollow he had made there appeared a pale face.\r\n\r\nThe cry had not proceeded from that face. Its eyes were shut, and the\r\nmouth open but full of snow.\r\n\r\nIt remained motionless; it stirred not under the hands of the child. The\r\nchild, whose fingers were numbed with frost, shuddered when he touched\r\nits coldness. It was that of a woman. Her dishevelled hair was mingled\r\nwith the snow. The woman was dead.\r\n\r\nAgain the child set himself to sweep away the snow. The neck of the dead\r\nwoman appeared; then her shoulders, clothed in rags. Suddenly he felt\r\nsomething move feebly under his touch. It was something small that was\r\nburied, and which stirred. The child swiftly cleared away the snow,\r\ndiscovering a wretched little body--thin, wan with cold, still alive,\r\nlying naked on the dead woman’s naked breast.\r\n\r\nIt was a little girl.\r\n\r\nIt had been swaddled up, but in rags so scanty that in its struggles it\r\nhad freed itself from its tatters. Under it its attenuated limbs, and\r\nabove it its breath, had somewhat melted the snow. A nurse would have\r\nsaid that it was five or six months old, but perhaps it might be a year,\r\nfor growth, in poverty, suffers heart-breaking reductions which\r\nsometimes even produce rachitis. When its face was exposed to the air it\r\ngave a cry, the continuation of its sobs of distress. For the mother not\r\nto have heard that sob, proved her irrevocably dead.\r\n\r\nThe child took the infant in his arms. The stiffened body of the mother\r\nwas a fearful sight; a spectral light proceeded from her face. The\r\nmouth, apart and without breath, seemed to form in the indistinct\r\nlanguage of shadows her answer to the questions put to the dead by the\r\ninvisible. The ghastly reflection of the icy plains was on that\r\ncountenance. There was the youthful forehead under the brown hair, the\r\nalmost indignant knitting of the eyebrows, the pinched nostrils, the\r\nclosed eyelids, the lashes glued together by the rime, and from the\r\ncorners of the eyes to the corners of the mouth a deep channel of tears.\r\nThe snow lighted up the corpse. Winter and the tomb are not adverse. The\r\ncorpse is the icicle of man. The nakedness of her breasts was pathetic.\r\nThey had fulfilled their purpose. On them was a sublime blight of the\r\nlife infused into one being by another from whom life has fled, and\r\nmaternal majesty was there instead of virginal purity. At the point of\r\none of the nipples was a white pearl. It was a drop of milk frozen.\r\n\r\nLet us explain at once. On the plains over which the deserted boy was\r\npassing in his turn a beggar woman, nursing her infant and searching for\r\na refuge, had lost her way a few hours before. Benumbed with cold she\r\nhad sunk under the tempest, and could not rise again. The falling snow\r\nhad covered her. So long as she was able she had clasped her little girl\r\nto her bosom, and thus died.\r\n\r\nThe infant had tried to suck the marble breast. Blind trust, inspired by\r\nnature, for it seems that it is possible for a woman to suckle her child\r\neven after her last sigh.\r\n\r\nBut the lips of the infant had been unable to find the breast, where the\r\ndrop of milk, stolen by death, had frozen, whilst under the snow the\r\nchild, more accustomed to the cradle than the tomb, had wailed.\r\n\r\nThe deserted child had heard the cry of the dying child.\r\n\r\nHe disinterred it.\r\n\r\nHe took it in his arms.\r\n\r\nWhen she felt herself in his arms she ceased crying. The faces of the\r\ntwo children touched each other, and the purple lips of the infant\r\nsought the cheek of the boy, as it had been a breast. The little girl\r\nhad nearly reached the moment when the congealed blood stops the action\r\nof the heart. Her mother had touched her with the chill of her own\r\ndeath--a corpse communicates death; its numbness is infectious. Her\r\nfeet, hands, arms, knees, seemed paralyzed by cold. The boy felt the\r\nterrible chill. He had on him a garment dry and warm--his pilot jacket.\r\nHe placed the infant on the breast of the corpse, took off his jacket,\r\nwrapped the infant in it, took it up again in his arms, and now, almost\r\nnaked, under the blast of the north wind which covered him with eddies\r\nof snow-flakes, carrying the infant, he pursued his journey.\r\n\r\nThe little one having succeeded in finding the boy’s cheek, again\r\napplied her lips to it, and, soothed by the warmth, she slept. First\r\nkiss of those two souls in the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe mother lay there, her back to the snow, her face to the night; but\r\nperhaps at the moment when the little boy stripped himself to clothe the\r\nlittle girl, the mother saw him from the depths of infinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nA BURDEN MAKES A ROUGH ROAD ROUGHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was little more than four hours since the hooker had sailed from the\r\ncreek of Portland, leaving the boy on the shore. During the long hours\r\nsince he had been deserted, and had been journeying onwards, he had met\r\nbut three persons of that human society into which he was, perchance,\r\nabout to enter--a man, the man on the hill; a woman, the woman in the\r\nsnow; and the little girl whom he was carrying in his arms.\r\n\r\nHe was exhausted by fatigue and hunger, yet advanced more resolutely\r\nthan ever, with less strength and an added burden. He was now almost\r\nnaked. The few rags which remained to him, hardened by the frost, were\r\nsharp as glass, and cut his skin. He became colder, but the infant was\r\nwarmer. That which he lost was not thrown away, but was gained by her.\r\nHe found out that the poor infant enjoyed the comfort which was to her\r\nthe renewal of life. He continued to advance.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, still holding her securely, he bent down, and taking\r\na handful of snow he rubbed his feet with it, to prevent their being\r\nfrost-bitten. At other times, his throat feeling as if it were on fire,\r\nhe put a little snow in his mouth and sucked it; this for a moment\r\nassuaged his thirst, but changed it into fever--a relief which was an\r\naggravation.\r\n\r\nThe storm had become shapeless from its violence. Deluges of snow are\r\npossible. This was one. The paroxysm scourged the shore at the same time\r\nthat it uptore the depths of ocean. This was, perhaps, the moment when\r\nthe distracted hooker was going to pieces in the battle of the breakers.\r\n\r\nHe travelled under this north wind, still towards the east, over wide\r\nsurfaces of snow. He knew not how the hours had passed. For a long time\r\nhe had ceased to see the smoke. Such indications are soon effaced in the\r\nnight; besides, it was past the hour when fires are put out. Or he had,\r\nperhaps, made a mistake, and it was possible that neither town nor\r\nvillage existed in the direction in which he was travelling. Doubting,\r\nhe yet persevered.\r\n\r\nTwo or three times the little infant cried. Then he adopted in his gait\r\na rocking movement, and the child was soothed and silenced. She ended by\r\nfalling into a sound sleep. Shivering himself, he felt her warm. He\r\nfrequently tightened the folds of the jacket round the babe’s neck, so\r\nthat the frost should not get in through any opening, and that no melted\r\nsnow should drop between the garment and the child.\r\n\r\nThe plain was unequal. In the declivities into which it sloped the snow,\r\ndriven by the wind into the dips of the ground, was so deep, in\r\ncomparison with a child so small, that it almost engulfed him, and he\r\nhad to struggle through it half buried. He walked on, working away the\r\nsnow with his knees.\r\n\r\nHaving cleared the ravine, he reached the high lands swept by the winds,\r\nwhere the snow lay thin. Then he found the surface a sheet of ice. The\r\nlittle girl’s lukewarm breath, playing on his face, warmed it for a\r\nmoment, then lingered, and froze in his hair, stiffening it into\r\nicicles.\r\n\r\nHe felt the approach of another danger. He could not afford to fall. He\r\nknew that if he did so he should never rise again. He was overcome by\r\nfatigue, and the weight of the darkness would, as with the dead woman,\r\nhave held him to the ground, and the ice glued him alive to the earth.\r\n\r\nHe had tripped upon the slopes of precipices, and had recovered himself;\r\nhe had stumbled into holes, and had got out again. Thenceforward the\r\nslightest fall would be death; a false step opened for him a tomb. He\r\nmust not slip. He had not strength to rise even to his knees. Now\r\neverything was slippery; everywhere there was rime and frozen snow. The\r\nlittle creature whom he carried made his progress fearfully difficult.\r\nShe was not only a burden, which his weariness and exhaustion made\r\nexcessive, but was also an embarrassment. She occupied both his arms,\r\nand to him who walks over ice both arms are a natural and necessary\r\nbalancing power.\r\n\r\nHe was obliged to do without this balance.\r\n\r\nHe did without it and advanced, bending under his burden, not knowing\r\nwhat would become of him.\r\n\r\nThis little infant was the drop causing the cup of distress to overflow.\r\n\r\nHe advanced, reeling at every step, as if on a spring board, and\r\naccomplishing, without spectators, miracles of equilibrium. Let us\r\nrepeat that he was, perhaps, followed on this path of pain by eyes\r\nunsleeping in the distances of the shadows--the eyes of the mother and\r\nthe eyes of God. He staggered, slipped, recovered himself, took care of\r\nthe infant, and, gathering the jacket about her, he covered up her head;\r\nstaggered again, advanced, slipped, then drew himself up. The cowardly\r\nwind drove against him. Apparently, he made much more way than was\r\nnecessary. He was, to all appearance, on the plains where Bincleaves\r\nFarm was afterwards established, between what are now called Spring\r\nGardens and the Parsonage House. Homesteads and cottages occupy the\r\nplace of waste lands. Sometimes less than a century separates a steppe\r\nfrom a city.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a lull having occurred in the icy blast which was blinding\r\nhim, he perceived, at a short distance in front of him, a cluster of\r\ngables and of chimneys shown in relief by the snow. The reverse of a\r\nsilhouette--a city painted in white on a black horizon, something like\r\nwhat we call nowadays a negative proof. Roofs--dwellings--shelter! He\r\nhad arrived somewhere at last. He felt the ineffable encouragement of\r\nhope. The watch of a ship which has wandered from her course feels some\r\nsuch emotion when he cries, “Land ho!”\r\n\r\nHe hurried his steps.\r\n\r\nAt length, then, he was near mankind. He would soon be amidst living\r\ncreatures. There was no longer anything to fear. There glowed within him\r\nthat sudden warmth--security; that out of which he was emerging was\r\nover; thenceforward there would no longer be night, nor winter, nor\r\ntempest. It seemed to him that he had left all evil chances behind him.\r\nThe infant was no longer a burden. He almost ran.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were fixed on the roofs. There was life there. He never took\r\nhis eyes off them. A dead man might gaze thus on what might appear\r\nthrough the half-opened lid of his sepulchre. There were the chimneys of\r\nwhich he had seen the smoke.\r\n\r\nNo smoke arose from them now. He was not long before he reached the\r\nhouses. He came to the outskirts of a town--an open street. At that\r\nperiod bars to streets were falling into disuse.\r\n\r\nThe street began by two houses. In those two houses neither candle nor\r\nlamp was to be seen; nor in the whole street; nor in the whole town, so\r\nfar as eye could reach. The house to the right was a roof rather than a\r\nhouse; nothing could be more mean. The walls were of mud, the roof was\r\nof straw, and there was more thatch than wall. A large nettle, springing\r\nfrom the bottom of the wall, reached the roof. The hovel had but one\r\ndoor, which was like that of a dog-kennel; and a window, which was but a\r\nhole. All was shut up. At the side an inhabited pig-sty told that the\r\nhouse was also inhabited.\r\n\r\nThe house on the left was large, high, built entirely of stone, with a\r\nslated roof. It was also closed. It was the rich man’s home, opposite to\r\nthat of the pauper.\r\n\r\nThe boy did not hesitate. He approached the great mansion. The double\r\nfolding-door of massive oak, studded with large nails, was of the kind\r\nthat leads one to expect that behind it there is a stout armoury of\r\nbolts and locks. An iron knocker was attached to it. He raised the\r\nknocker with some difficulty, for his benumbed hands were stumps rather\r\nthan hands. He knocked once.\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nHe struck again, and two knocks.\r\n\r\nNo movement was heard in the house.\r\n\r\nHe knocked a third time.\r\n\r\nThere was no sound. He saw that they were all asleep, and did not care\r\nto get up.\r\n\r\nThen he turned to the hovel. He picked up a pebble from the snow, and\r\nknocked against the low door.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.\r\n\r\nHe raised himself on tiptoe, and knocked with his pebble against the\r\npane too softly to break the glass, but loud enough to be heard.\r\n\r\nNo voice was heard; no step moved; no candle was lighted.\r\n\r\nHe saw that there, as well, they did not care to awake.\r\n\r\nThe house of stone and the thatched hovel were equally deaf to the\r\nwretched.\r\n\r\nThe boy decided on pushing on further, and penetrating the strait of\r\nhouses which stretched away in front of him, so dark that it seemed more\r\nlike a gulf between two cliffs than the entrance to a town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nANOTHER FORM OF DESERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Weymouth which he had just entered. Weymouth then was not the\r\nrespectable and fine Weymouth of to-day.\r\n\r\nAncient Weymouth did not present, like the present one, an\r\nirreproachable rectangular quay, with an inn and a statue in honour of\r\nGeorge III. This resulted from the fact that George III. had not yet\r\nbeen born. For the same reason they had not yet designed on the slope of\r\nthe green hill towards the east, fashioned flat on the soil by cutting\r\naway the turf and leaving the bare chalk to the view, the white horse,\r\nan acre long, bearing the king upon his back, and always turning, in\r\nhonour of George III., his tail to the city. These honours, however,\r\nwere deserved. George III., having lost in his old age the intellect he\r\nhad never possessed in his youth, was not responsible for the calamities\r\nof his reign. He was an innocent. Why not erect statues to him?\r\n\r\nWeymouth, a hundred and eighty years ago, was about as symmetrical as a\r\ngame of spillikins in confusion. In legends it is said that Astaroth\r\ntravelled over the world, carrying on her back a wallet which contained\r\neverything, even good women in their houses. A pell-mell of sheds thrown\r\nfrom her devil’s bag would give an idea of that irregular Weymouth--the\r\ngood women in the sheds included. The Music Hall remains as a specimen\r\nof those buildings. A confusion of wooden dens, carved and eaten by\r\nworms (which carve in another fashion)--shapeless, overhanging\r\nbuildings, some with pillars, leaning one against the other for support\r\nagainst the sea wind, and leaving between them awkward spaces of narrow\r\nand winding channels, lanes, and passages, often flooded by the\r\nequinoctial tides; a heap of old grandmother houses, crowded round a\r\ngrandfather church--such was Weymouth; a sort of old Norman village\r\nthrown up on the coast of England.\r\n\r\nThe traveller who entered the tavern, now replaced by the hotel, instead\r\nof paying royally his twenty-five francs for a fried sole and a bottle\r\nof wine, had to suffer the humiliation of eating a pennyworth of soup\r\nmade of fish--which soup, by-the-bye, was very good. Wretched fare!\r\n\r\nThe deserted child, carrying the foundling, passed through the first\r\nstreet, then the second, then the third. He raised his eyes, seeking in\r\nthe higher stories and in the roofs a lighted window-pane; but all were\r\nclosed and dark. At intervals he knocked at the doors. No one answered.\r\nNothing makes the heart so like a stone as being warm between sheets.\r\nThe noise and the shaking had at length awakened the infant. He knew\r\nthis because he felt her suck his cheek. She did not cry, believing him\r\nher mother.\r\n\r\nHe was about to turn and wander long, perhaps, in the intersections of\r\nthe Scrambridge lanes, where there were then more cultivated plots than\r\ndwellings, more thorn hedges than houses; but fortunately he struck into\r\na passage which exists to this day near Trinity schools. This passage\r\nled him to a water-brink, where there was a roughly built quay with a\r\nparapet, and to the right he made out a bridge. It was the bridge over\r\nthe Wey, connecting Weymouth with Melcombe Regis, and under the arches\r\nof which the Backwater joins the harbour.\r\n\r\nWeymouth, a hamlet, was then the suburb of Melcombe Regis, a city and\r\nport. Now Melcombe Regis is a parish of Weymouth. The village has\r\nabsorbed the city. It was the bridge which did the work. Bridges are\r\nstrange vehicles of suction, which inhale the population, and sometimes\r\nswell one river-bank at the expense of its opposite neighbour.\r\n\r\nThe boy went to the bridge, which at that period was a covered timber\r\nstructure. He crossed it. Thanks to its roofing, there was no snow on\r\nthe planks. His bare feet had a moment’s comfort as they crossed them.\r\nHaving passed over the bridge, he was in Melcombe Regis. There were\r\nfewer wooden houses than stone ones there. He was no longer in the\r\nvillage; he was in the city.\r\n\r\nThe bridge opened on a rather fine street called St. Thomas’s Street. He\r\nentered it. Here and there were high carved gables and shop-fronts. He\r\nset to knocking at the doors again: he had no strength left to call or\r\nshout.\r\n\r\nAt Melcombe Regis, as at Weymouth, no one was stirring. The doors were\r\nall carefully double-locked, The windows were covered by their shutters,\r\nas the eyes by their lids. Every precaution had been taken to avoid\r\nbeing roused by disagreeable surprises. The little wanderer was\r\nsuffering the indefinable depression made by a sleeping town. Its\r\nsilence, as of a paralyzed ants’ nest, makes the head swim. All its\r\nlethargies mingle their nightmares, its slumbers are a crowd, and from\r\nits human bodies lying prone there arises a vapour of dreams. Sleep has\r\ngloomy associates beyond this life: the decomposed thoughts of the\r\nsleepers float above them in a mist which is both of death and of life,\r\nand combine with the possible, which has also, perhaps, the power of\r\nthought, as it floats in space. Hence arise entanglements. Dreams, those\r\nclouds, interpose their folds and their transparencies over that star,\r\nthe mind. Above those closed eyelids, where vision has taken the place\r\nof sight, a sepulchral disintegration of outlines and appearances\r\ndilates itself into impalpability. Mysterious, diffused existences\r\namalgamate themselves with life on that border of death, which sleep is.\r\nThose larvæ and souls mingle in the air. Even he who sleeps not feels a\r\nmedium press upon him full of sinister life. The surrounding chimera,\r\nin which he suspects a reality, impedes him. The waking man, wending his\r\nway amidst the sleep phantoms of others, unconsciously pushes back\r\npassing shadows, has, or imagines that he has, a vague fear of adverse\r\ncontact with the invisible, and feels at every moment the obscure\r\npressure of a hostile encounter which immediately dissolves. There is\r\nsomething of the effect of a forest in the nocturnal diffusion of\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nThis is what is called being afraid without reason.\r\n\r\nWhat a man feels a child feels still more.\r\n\r\nThe uneasiness of nocturnal fear, increased by the spectral houses,\r\nincreased the weight of the sad burden under which he was struggling.\r\n\r\nHe entered Conycar Lane, and perceived at the end of that passage the\r\nBackwater, which he took for the ocean. He no longer knew in what\r\ndirection the sea lay. He retraced his steps, struck to the left by\r\nMaiden Street, and returned as far as St. Alban’s Row.\r\n\r\nThere, by chance and without selection, he knocked violently at any\r\nhouse that he happened to pass. His blows, on which he was expending his\r\nlast energies, were jerky and without aim; now ceasing altogether for a\r\ntime, now renewed as if in irritation. It was the violence of his fever\r\nstriking against the doors.\r\n\r\nOne voice answered.\r\n\r\nThat of Time.\r\n\r\nThree o’clock tolled slowly behind him from the old belfry of St.\r\nNicholas.\r\n\r\nThen all sank into silence again.\r\n\r\nThat no inhabitant should have opened a lattice may appear surprising.\r\nNevertheless that silence is in a great measure to be explained. We must\r\nremember that in January 1790 they were just over a somewhat severe\r\noutbreak of the plague in London, and that the fear of receiving sick\r\nvagabonds caused a diminution of hospitality everywhere. People would\r\nnot even open their windows for fear of inhaling the poison.\r\n\r\nThe child felt the coldness of men more terribly than the coldness of\r\nnight. The coldness of men is intentional. He felt a tightening on his\r\nsinking heart which he had not known on the open plains. Now he had\r\nentered into the midst of life, and remained alone. This was the summit\r\nof misery. The pitiless desert he had understood; the unrelenting town\r\nwas too much to bear.\r\n\r\nThe hour, the strokes of which he had just counted, had been another\r\nblow. Nothing is so freezing in certain situations as the voice of the\r\nhour. It is a declaration of indifference. It is Eternity saying, “What\r\ndoes it matter to me?”\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and it is not certain that, in that miserable minute, he did\r\nnot ask himself whether it would not be easier to lie down there and\r\ndie. However, the little infant leaned her head against his shoulder,\r\nand fell asleep again.\r\n\r\nThis blind confidence set him onwards again. He whom all supports were\r\nfailing felt that he was himself a basis of support. Irresistible\r\nsummons of duty!\r\n\r\nNeither such ideas nor such a situation belonged to his age. It is\r\nprobable that he did not understand them. It was a matter of instinct.\r\nHe did what he chanced to do.\r\n\r\nHe set out again in the direction of Johnstone Row. But now he no longer\r\nwalked; he dragged himself along. He left St. Mary’s Street to the left,\r\nmade zigzags through lanes, and at the end of a winding passage found\r\nhimself in a rather wide open space. It was a piece of waste land not\r\nbuilt upon--probably the spot where Chesterfield Place now stands. The\r\nhouses ended there. He perceived the sea to the right, and scarcely\r\nanything more of the town to his left.\r\n\r\nWhat was to become of him? Here was the country again. To the east great\r\ninclined planes of snow marked out the wide slopes of Radipole. Should\r\nhe continue this journey? Should he advance and re-enter the solitudes?\r\nShould he return and re-enter the streets? What was he to do between\r\nthose two silences--the mute plain and the deaf city? Which of the two\r\nrefusals should he choose?\r\n\r\nThere is the anchor of mercy. There is also the look of piteousness. It\r\nwas that look which the poor little despairing wanderer threw around\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAll at once he heard a menace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMISANTHROPY PLAYS ITS PRANKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA strange and alarming grinding of teeth reached him through the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nIt was enough to drive one back: he advanced. To those to whom silence\r\nhas become dreadful a howl is comforting.\r\n\r\nThat fierce growl reassured him; that threat was a promise. There was\r\nthere a being alive and awake, though it might be a wild beast. He\r\nadvanced in the direction whence came the snarl.\r\n\r\nHe turned the corner of a wall, and, behind in the vast sepulchral light\r\nmade by the reflection of snow and sea, he saw a thing placed as if for\r\nshelter. It was a cart, unless it was a hovel. It had wheels--it was a\r\ncarriage. It had a roof--it was a dwelling. From the roof arose a\r\nfunnel, and out of the funnel smoke. This smoke was red, and seemed to\r\nimply a good fire in the interior. Behind, projecting hinges indicated a\r\ndoor, and in the centre of this door a square opening showed a light\r\ninside the caravan. He approached.\r\n\r\nWhatever had growled perceived his approach, and became furious. It was\r\nno longer a growl which he had to meet; it was a roar. He heard a sharp\r\nsound, as of a chain violently pulled to its full length, and suddenly,\r\nunder the door, between the hind wheels, two rows of sharp white teeth\r\nappeared. At the same time as the mouth between the wheels a head was\r\nput through the window.\r\n\r\n“Peace there!” said the head.\r\n\r\nThe mouth was silent.\r\n\r\nThe head began again,--\r\n\r\n“Is any one there?”\r\n\r\nThe child answered,--\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“I.”\r\n\r\n“You? Who are you? whence do you come?”\r\n\r\n“I am weary,” said the child.\r\n\r\n“What o’clock is it?”\r\n\r\n“I am cold.”\r\n\r\n“What are you doing there?”\r\n\r\n“I am hungry.”\r\n\r\nThe head replied,--\r\n\r\n“Every one cannot be as happy as a lord. Go away.”\r\n\r\nThe head was withdrawn and the window closed.\r\n\r\nThe child bowed his forehead, drew the sleeping infant closer in his\r\narms, and collected his strength to resume his journey. He had taken a\r\nfew steps, and was hurrying away.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the same time that the window closed the door had opened; a\r\nstep had been let down; the voice which had spoken to the child cried\r\nout angrily from the inside of the van,--\r\n\r\n“Well! why do you not enter?”\r\n\r\nThe child turned back.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” resumed the voice. “Who has sent me a fellow like this, who\r\nis hungry and cold, and who does not come in?”\r\n\r\nThe child, at once repulsed and invited, remained motionless.\r\n\r\nThe voice continued,--\r\n\r\n“You are told to come in, you young rascal.”\r\n\r\nHe made up his mind, and placed one foot on the lowest step.\r\n\r\nThere was a great growl under the van. He drew back. The gaping jaws\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n“Peace!” cried the voice of the man.\r\n\r\nThe jaws retreated, the growling ceased.\r\n\r\n“Come up!” continued the man.\r\n\r\nThe child with difficulty climbed up the three steps. He was impeded by\r\nthe infant, so benumbed, rolled up and enveloped in the jacket that\r\nnothing could be distinguished of her, and she was but a little\r\nshapeless mass.\r\n\r\nHe passed over the three steps; and having reached the threshold,\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nNo candle was burning in the caravan, probably from the economy of want.\r\nThe hut was lighted only by a red tinge, arising from the opening at the\r\ntop of the stove, in which sparkled a peat fire. On the stove were\r\nsmoking a porringer and a saucepan, containing to all appearance\r\nsomething to eat. The savoury odour was perceptible. The hut was\r\nfurnished with a chest, a stool, and an unlighted lantern which hung\r\nfrom the ceiling. Besides, to the partition were attached some boards on\r\nbrackets and some hooks, from which hung a variety of things. On the\r\nboards and nails were rows of glasses, coppers, an alembic, a vessel\r\nrather like those used for graining wax, which are called granulators,\r\nand a confusion of strange objects of which the child understood\r\nnothing, and which were utensils for cooking and chemistry. The caravan\r\nwas oblong in shape, the stove being in front. It was not even a little\r\nroom; it was scarcely a big box. There was more light outside from the\r\nsnow than inside from the stove. Everything in the caravan was\r\nindistinct and misty. Nevertheless, a reflection of the fire on the\r\nceiling enabled the spectator to read in large letters,--\r\n\r\n    URSUS, PHILOSOPHER.\r\n\r\nThe child, in fact, was entering the house of Homo and Ursus. The one he\r\nhad just heard growling, the other speaking.\r\n\r\nThe child having reached the threshold, perceived near the stove a man,\r\ntall, smooth, thin and old, dressed in gray, whose head, as he stood,\r\nreached the roof. The man could not have raised himself on tiptoe. The\r\ncaravan was just his size.\r\n\r\n“Come in!” said the man, who was Ursus.\r\n\r\nThe child entered.\r\n\r\n“Put down your bundle.”\r\n\r\nThe child placed his burden carefully on the top of the chest, for fear\r\nof awakening and terrifying it.\r\n\r\nThe man continued,--\r\n\r\n“How gently you put it down! You could not be more careful were it a\r\ncase of relics. Is it that you are afraid of tearing a hole in your\r\nrags? Worthless vagabond! in the streets at this hour! Who are you?\r\nAnswer! But no. I forbid you to answer. There! You are cold. Warm\r\nyourself as quick as you can,” and he shoved him by the shoulders in\r\nfront of the fire.\r\n\r\n“How wet you are! You’re frozen through! A nice state to come into a\r\nhouse! Come, take off those rags, you villain!” and as with one hand,\r\nand with feverish haste, he dragged off the boy’s rags which tore into\r\nshreds, with the other he took down from a nail a man’s shirt, and one\r\nof those knitted jackets which are up to this day called kiss-me-quicks.\r\n\r\n“Here are clothes.”\r\n\r\nHe chose out of a heap a woollen rag, and chafed before the fire the\r\nlimbs of the exhausted and bewildered child, who at that moment, warm\r\nand naked, felt as if he were seeing and touching heaven. The limbs\r\nhaving been rubbed, he next wiped the boy’s feet.\r\n\r\n“Come, you limb; you have nothing frost-bitten! I was a fool to fancy\r\nyou had something frozen, hind legs or fore paws. You will not lose the\r\nuse of them this time. Dress yourself!”\r\n\r\nThe child put on the shirt, and the man slipped the knitted jacket over\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Now....”\r\n\r\nThe man kicked the stool forward and made the little boy sit down, again\r\nshoving him by the shoulders; then he pointed with his finger to the\r\nporringer which was smoking upon the stove. What the child saw in the\r\nporringer was again heaven to him--namely, a potato and a bit of bacon.\r\n\r\n“You are hungry; eat!”\r\n\r\nThe man took from the shelf a crust of hard bread and an iron fork, and\r\nhanded them to the child.\r\n\r\nThe boy hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you expect me to lay the cloth,” said the man, and he placed\r\nthe porringer on the child’s lap.\r\n\r\n“Gobble that up.”\r\n\r\nHunger overcame astonishment. The child began to eat. The poor boy\r\ndevoured rather than ate. The glad sound of the crunching of bread filed\r\nthe hut. The man grumbled,--\r\n\r\n“Not so quick, you horrid glutton! Isn’t he a greedy scoundrel? When\r\nsuch scum are hungry, they eat in a revolting fashion. You should see a\r\nlord sup. In my time I have seen dukes eat. They don’t eat; that’s\r\nnoble. They drink, however. Come, you pig, stuff yourself!”\r\n\r\nThe absence of ears, which is the concomitant of a hungry stomach,\r\ncaused the child to take little heed of these violent epithets, tempered\r\nas they were by charity of action involving a contradiction resulting in\r\nhis benefit. For the moment he was absorbed by two exigencies and by two\r\necstasies--food and warmth.\r\n\r\nUrsus continued his imprecations, muttering to himself,--\r\n\r\n“I have seen King James supping _in propriâ personâ_ in the Banqueting\r\nHouse, where are to be admired the paintings of the famous Rubens. His\r\nMajesty touched nothing. This beggar here browses: browses, a word\r\nderived from brute. What put it into my head to come to this Weymouth\r\nseven times devoted to the infernal deities? I have sold nothing since\r\nmorning I have harangued the snow. I have played the flute to the\r\nhurricane. I have not pocketed a farthing; and now, to-night, beggars\r\ndrop in. Horrid place! There is battle, struggle, competition between\r\nthe fools in the street and myself. They try to give me nothing but\r\nfarthings. I try to give them nothing but drugs. Well, to-day I’ve made\r\nnothing. Not an idiot on the highway, not a penny in the till. Eat away,\r\nhell-born boy! Tear and crunch! We have fallen on times when nothing can\r\nequal the cynicism of spongers. Fatten at my expense, parasite! This\r\nwretched boy is more than hungry; he is mad. It is not appetite, it is\r\nferocity. He is carried away by a rabid virus. Perhaps he has the\r\nplague. Have you the plague, you thief? Suppose he were to give it to\r\nHomo! No, never! Let the populace die, but not my wolf. But by-the-bye I\r\nam hungry myself. I declare that this is all very disagreeable. I have\r\nworked far into the night. There are seasons in a man’s life when he is\r\nhard pressed. I was to-night, by hunger. I was alone. I made a fire. I\r\nhad but one potato, one crust of bread, a mouthful of bacon, and a drop\r\nof milk, and I put it to warm. I said to myself, ‘Good.’ I think I am\r\ngoing to eat, and bang! this crocodile falls upon me at the very moment.\r\nHe installs himself clean between my food and myself. Behold, how my\r\nlarder is devastated! Eat, pike, eat! You shark! how many teeth have you\r\nin your jaws? Guzzle, wolf-cub; no, I withdraw that word. I respect\r\nwolves. Swallow up my food, boa. I have worked all day, and far into the\r\nnight, on an empty stomach; my throat is sore, my pancreas in distress,\r\nmy entrails torn; and my reward is to see another eat. ’Tis all one,\r\nthough! We will divide. He shall have the bread, the potato, and the\r\nbacon; but I will have the milk.”\r\n\r\nJust then a wail, touching and prolonged, arose in the hut. The man\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\n“You cry, sycophant! Why do you cry?”\r\n\r\nThe boy turned towards him. It was evident that it was not he who cried.\r\nHe had his mouth full.\r\n\r\nThe cry continued.\r\n\r\nThe man went to the chest.\r\n\r\n“So it is your bundle that wails! Vale of Jehoshaphat! Behold a\r\nvociferating parcel! What the devil has your bundle got to croak about?”\r\n\r\nHe unrolled the jacket. An infant’s head appeared, the mouth open and\r\ncrying.\r\n\r\n“Well, who goes there?” said the man. “Here is another of them. When is\r\nthis to end? Who is there? To arms! Corporal, call out the guard!\r\nAnother bang! What have you brought me, thief! Don’t you see it is\r\nthirsty? Come! the little one must have a drink. So now I shall not have\r\neven the milk!”\r\n\r\nHe took down from the things lying in disorder on the shelf a bandage of\r\nlinen, a sponge and a phial, muttering savagely, “What an infernal\r\nplace!”\r\n\r\nThen he looked at the little infant. “’Tis a girl! one can tell that by\r\nher scream, and she is drenched as well.” He dragged away, as he had\r\ndone from the boy, the tatters in which she was knotted up rather than\r\ndressed, and swathed her in a rag, which, though of coarse linen, was\r\nclean and dry. This rough and sudden dressing made the infant angry.\r\n\r\n“She mews relentlessly,” said he.\r\n\r\nHe bit off a long piece of sponge, tore from the roll a square piece of\r\nlinen, drew from it a bit of thread, took the saucepan containing the\r\nmilk from the stove, filled the phial with milk, drove down the sponge\r\nhalfway into its neck, covered the sponge with linen, tied this cork in\r\nwith the thread, applied his cheeks to the phial to be sure that it was\r\nnot too hot, and seized under his left arm the bewildered bundle which\r\nwas still crying. “Come! take your supper, creature! Let me suckle you,”\r\nand he put the neck of the bottle to its mouth.\r\n\r\nThe little infant drank greedily.\r\n\r\nHe held the phial at the necessary incline, grumbling, “They are all the\r\nsame, the cowards! When they have all they want they are silent.”\r\n\r\nThe child had drunk so ravenously, and had seized so eagerly this breast\r\noffered by a cross-grained providence, that she was taken with a fit of\r\ncoughing.\r\n\r\n“You are going to choke!” growled Ursus. “A fine gobbler this one, too!”\r\n\r\nHe drew away the sponge which she was sucking, allowed the cough to\r\nsubside, and then replaced the phial to her lips, saying, “Suck, you\r\nlittle wretch!”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the boy had laid down his fork. Seeing the infant drink\r\nhad made him forget to eat. The moment before, while he ate, the\r\nexpression in his face was satisfaction; now it was gratitude. He\r\nwatched the infant’s renewal of life; the completion of the resurrection\r\nbegun by himself filled his eyes with an ineffable brilliancy. Ursus\r\nwent on muttering angry words between his teeth. The little boy now and\r\nthen lifted towards Ursus his eyes moist with the unspeakable emotion\r\nwhich the poor little being felt, but was unable to express. Ursus\r\naddressed him furiously.\r\n\r\n“Well, will you eat?”\r\n\r\n“And you?” said the child, trembling all over, and with tears in his\r\neyes. “You will have nothing!”\r\n\r\n“Will you be kind enough to eat it all up, you cub? There is not too\r\nmuch for you, since there was not enough for me.”\r\n\r\nThe child took up his fork, but did not eat.\r\n\r\n“Eat,” shouted Ursus. “What has it got to do with me? Who speaks of me?\r\nWretched little barefooted clerk of Penniless Parish, I tell you, eat it\r\nall up! You are here to eat, drink, and sleep--eat, or I will kick you\r\nout, both of you.”\r\n\r\nThe boy, under this menace, began to eat again. He had not much trouble\r\nin finishing what was left in the porringer. Ursus muttered, “This\r\nbuilding is badly joined. The cold comes in by the window pane.” A pane\r\nhad indeed been broken in front, either by a jolt of the caravan or by a\r\nstone thrown by some mischievous boy. Ursus had placed a star of paper\r\nover the fracture, which had become unpasted. The blast entered there.\r\n\r\nHe was half seated on the chest. The infant in his arms, and at the same\r\ntime on his lap, was sucking rapturously at the bottle, in the happy\r\nsomnolency of cherubim before their Creator, and infants at their\r\nmothers’ breast.\r\n\r\n“She is drunk,” said Ursus; and he continued, “After this, preach\r\nsermons on temperance!”\r\n\r\nThe wind tore from the pane the plaster of paper, which flew across the\r\nhut; but this was nothing to the children, who were entering life anew.\r\nWhilst the little girl drank, and the little boy ate, Ursus grumbled,--\r\n\r\n“Drunkenness begins in the infant in swaddling clothes. What useful\r\ntrouble Bishop Tillotson gives himself, thundering against excessive\r\ndrinking. What an odious draught of wind! And then my stove is old. It\r\nallows puffs of smoke to escape enough to give you trichiasis. One has\r\nthe inconvenience of cold, and the inconvenience of fire. One cannot see\r\nclearly. That being over there abuses my hospitality. Well, I have not\r\nbeen able to distinguish the animal’s face yet. Comfort is wanting\r\nhere. By Jove! I am a great admirer of exquisite banquets in well closed\r\nrooms. I have missed my vocation. I was born to be a sensualist. The\r\ngreatest of stoics was Philoxenus, who wished to possess the neck of a\r\ncrane, so as to be longer in tasting the pleasures of the table.\r\nReceipts to-day, naught. Nothing sold all day. Inhabitants, servants,\r\nand tradesmen, here is the doctor, here are the drugs. You are losing\r\nyour time, old friend. Pack up your physic. Every one is well down here.\r\nIt’s a cursed town, where every one is well! The skies alone have\r\ndiarrhoea--what snow! Anaxagoras taught that the snow was black; and he\r\nwas right, cold being blackness. Ice is night. What a hurricane! I can\r\nfancy the delight of those at sea. The hurricane is the passage of\r\ndemons. It is the row of the tempest fiends galloping and rolling head\r\nover heels above our bone-boxes. In the cloud this one has a tail, that\r\none has horns, another a flame for a tongue, another claws to its wings,\r\nanother a lord chancellor’s paunch, another an academician’s pate. You\r\nmay observe a form in every sound. To every fresh wind a fresh demon.\r\nThe ear hears, the eye sees, the crash is a face. Zounds! There are\r\nfolks at sea--that is certain. My friends, get through the storm as best\r\nyou can. I have enough to do to get through life. Come now, do I keep an\r\ninn, or do I not? Why should I trade with these travellers? The\r\nuniversal distress sends its spatterings even as far as my poverty. Into\r\nmy cabin fall hideous drops of the far-spreading mud of mankind. I am\r\ngiven up to the voracity of travellers. I am a prey--the prey of those\r\ndying of hunger. Winter, night, a pasteboard hut, an unfortunate friend\r\nbelow and without, the storm, a potato, a fire as big as my fist,\r\nparasites, the wind penetrating through every cranny, not a halfpenny,\r\nand bundles which set to howling. I open them and find beggars inside.\r\nIs this fair? Besides, the laws are violated. Ah! vagabond with your\r\nvagabond child! Mischievous pick-pocket, evil-minded abortion, so you\r\nwalk the streets after curfew? If our good king only knew it, would he\r\nnot have you thrown into the bottom of a ditch, just to teach you\r\nbetter? My gentleman walks out at night with my lady, and with the glass\r\nat fifteen degrees of frost, bare-headed and bare-footed. Understand\r\nthat such things are forbidden. There are rules and regulations, you\r\nlawless wretches. Vagabonds are punished, honest folks who have houses\r\nare guarded and protected. Kings are the fathers of their people. I have\r\nmy own house. You would have been whipped in the public street had you\r\nchanced to have been met, and quite right, too. There must be order in\r\nan established city. For my own part, I did wrong not to denounce you to\r\nthe constable. But I am such a fool! I understand what is right and do\r\nwhat is wrong. O the ruffian! to come here in such a state! I did not\r\nsee the snow upon them when they came in; it had melted, and here’s my\r\nwhole house swamped. I have an inundation in my home. I shall have to\r\nburn an incredible amount of coals to dry up this lake--coals at twelve\r\nfarthings the miners’ standard! How am I going to manage to fit three\r\ninto this caravan? Now it is over; I enter the nursery; I am going to\r\nhave in my house the weaning of the future beggardom of England. I shall\r\nhave for employment, office, and function, to fashion the miscarried\r\nfortunes of that colossal prostitute, Misery, to bring to perfection\r\nfuture gallows’ birds, and to give young thieves the forms of\r\nphilosophy. The tongue of the wolf is the warning of God. And to think\r\nthat if I had not been eaten up by creatures of this kind for the last\r\nthirty years, I should be rich; Homo would be fat; I should have a\r\nmedicine-chest full of rarities; as many surgical instruments as Doctor\r\nLinacre, surgeon to King Henry VIII.; divers animals of all kinds;\r\nEgyptian mummies, and similar curiosities; I should be a member of the\r\nCollege of Physicians, and have the right of using the library, built in\r\n1652 by the celebrated Hervey, and of studying in the lantern of that\r\ndome, whence you can see the whole of London. I could continue my\r\nobservations of solar obfuscation, and prove that a caligenous vapour\r\narises from the planet. Such was the opinion of John Kepler, who was\r\nborn the year before the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, and who was\r\nmathematician to the emperor. The sun is a chimney which sometimes\r\nsmokes; so does my stove. My stove is no better than the sun. Yes, I\r\nshould have made my fortune; my part would have been a different one--I\r\nshould not be the insignificant fellow I am. I should not degrade\r\nscience in the highways, for the crowd is not worthy of the doctrine,\r\nthe crowd being nothing better than a confused mixture of all sorts of\r\nages, sexes, humours, and conditions, that wise men of all periods have\r\nnot hesitated to despise, and whose extravagance and passion the most\r\nmoderate men in their justice detest. Oh, I am weary of existence! After\r\nall, one does not live long! The human life is soon done with. But\r\nno--it is long. At intervals, that we should not become too discouraged,\r\nthat we may have the stupidity to consent to bear our being, and not\r\nprofit by the magnificent opportunities to hang ourselves which cords\r\nand nails afford, nature puts on an air of taking a little care of\r\nman--not to-night, though. The rogue causes the wheat to spring up,\r\nripens the grape, gives her song to the nightingale. From time to time a\r\nray of morning or a glass of gin, and that is what we call happiness! It\r\nis a narrow border of good round a huge winding-sheet of evil. We have a\r\ndestiny of which the devil has woven the stuff and God has sewn the hem.\r\nIn the meantime, you have eaten my supper, you thief!”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the infant whom he was holding all the time in his arms\r\nvery tenderly whilst he was vituperating, shut its eyes languidly; a\r\nsign of repletion. Ursus examined the phial, and grumbled,--\r\n\r\n“She has drunk it all up, the impudent creature!”\r\n\r\nHe arose, and sustaining the infant with his left arm, with his right he\r\nraised the lid of the chest and drew from beneath it a bear-skin--the\r\none he called, as will be remembered, his real skin. Whilst he was doing\r\nthis he heard the other child eating, and looked at him sideways.\r\n\r\n“It will be something to do if, henceforth, I have to feed that growing\r\nglutton. It will be a worm gnawing at the vitals of my industry.”\r\n\r\nHe spread out, still with one arm, the bear-skin on the chest, working\r\nhis elbow and managing his movements so as not to disturb the sleep into\r\nwhich the infant was just sinking.\r\n\r\nThen he laid her down on the fur, on the side next the fire. Having done\r\nso, he placed the phial on the stove, and exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“I’m thirsty, if you like!”\r\n\r\nHe looked into the pot. There were a few good mouthfuls of milk left in\r\nit; he raised it to his lips. Just as he was about to drink, his eye\r\nfell on the little girl. He replaced the pot on the stove, took the\r\nphial, uncorked it, poured into it all the milk that remained, which was\r\njust sufficient to fill it, replaced the sponge and the linen rag over\r\nit, and tied it round the neck of the bottle.\r\n\r\n“All the same, I’m hungry and thirsty,” he observed.\r\n\r\nAnd he added,--\r\n\r\n“When one cannot eat bread, one must drink water.”\r\n\r\nBehind the stove there was a jug with the spout off. He took it and\r\nhanded it to the boy.\r\n\r\n“Will you drink?”\r\n\r\nThe child drank, and then went on eating.\r\n\r\nUrsus seized the pitcher again, and conveyed it to his mouth. The\r\ntemperature of the water which it contained had been unequally modified\r\nby the proximity of the stove.\r\n\r\nHe swallowed some mouthfuls and made a grimace.\r\n\r\n“Water! pretending to be pure, thou resemblest false friends. Thou art\r\nwarm at the top and cold at bottom.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the boy had finished his supper. The porringer was more\r\nthan empty; it was cleaned out. He picked up and ate pensively a few\r\ncrumbs caught in the folds of the knitted jacket on his lap.\r\n\r\nUrsus turned towards him.\r\n\r\n“That is not all. Now, a word with you. The mouth is not made only for\r\neating; it is made for speaking. Now that you are warmed and stuffed,\r\nyou beast, take care of yourself. You are going to answer my questions.\r\nWhence do you come?”\r\n\r\nThe child replied,--\r\n\r\n“I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean? you don’t know?”\r\n\r\n“I was abandoned this evening on the sea-shore.”\r\n\r\n“You little scamp! what’s your name? He is so good for nothing that his\r\nrelations desert him.”\r\n\r\n“I have no relations.”\r\n\r\n“Give in a little to my tastes, and observe that I do not like those who\r\nsing to a tune of fibs. Thou must have relatives since you have a\r\nsister.”\r\n\r\n“It is not my sister.”\r\n\r\n“It is not your sister?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Who is it then?”\r\n\r\n“It is a baby that I found.”\r\n\r\n“Found?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What! did you pick her up?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Where? If you lie I will exterminate you.”\r\n\r\n“On the breast of a woman who was dead in the snow.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“An hour ago.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“A league from here.”\r\n\r\nThe arched brow of Ursus knitted and took that pointed shape which\r\ncharacterizes emotion on the brow of a philosopher.\r\n\r\n“Dead! Lucky for her! We must leave her in the snow. She is well off\r\nthere. In which direction?”\r\n\r\n“In the direction of the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Did you cross the bridge?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nUrsus opened the window at the back and examined the view.\r\n\r\nThe weather had not improved. The snow was falling thickly and\r\nmournfully.\r\n\r\nHe shut the window.\r\n\r\nHe went to the broken glass; he filled the hole with a rag; he heaped\r\nthe stove with peat; he spread out as far as he could the bear-skin on\r\nthe chest; took a large book which he had in a corner, placed it under\r\nthe skin for a pillow, and laid the head of the sleeping infant on it.\r\n\r\nThen he turned to the boy.\r\n\r\n“Lie down there.”\r\n\r\nThe boy obeyed, and stretched himself at full length by the side of the\r\ninfant.\r\n\r\nUrsus rolled the bear-skin over the two children, and tucked it under\r\ntheir feet.\r\n\r\nHe took down from a shelf, and tied round his waist, a linen belt with a\r\nlarge pocket containing, no doubt, a case of instruments and bottles of\r\nrestoratives.\r\n\r\nThen he took the lantern from where it hung to the ceiling and lighted\r\nit. It was a dark lantern. When lighted it still left the children in\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\nUrsus half opened the door, and said,--\r\n\r\n“I am going out; do not be afraid. I shall return. Go to sleep.”\r\n\r\nThen letting down the steps, he called Homo. He was answered by a\r\nloving growl.\r\n\r\nUrsus, holding the lantern in his hand, descended. The steps were\r\nreplaced, the door was reclosed. The children remained alone.\r\n\r\nFrom without, a voice, the voice of Ursus, said,--\r\n\r\n“You, boy, who have just eaten up my supper, are you already asleep?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the child.\r\n\r\n“Well, if she cries, give her the rest of the milk.”\r\n\r\nThe clinking of a chain being undone was heard, and the sound of a man’s\r\nfootsteps, mingled with that of the pads of an animal, died off in the\r\ndistance. A few minutes after, both children slept profoundly.\r\n\r\nThe little boy and girl, lying naked side by side, were joined through\r\nthe silent hours, in the seraphic promiscuousness of the shadows; such\r\ndreams as were possible to their age floated from one to the other;\r\nbeneath their closed eyelids there shone, perhaps, a starlight; if the\r\nword marriage were not inappropriate to the situation, they were husband\r\nand wife after the fashion of the angels. Such innocence in such\r\ndarkness, such purity in such an embrace; such foretastes of heaven are\r\npossible only to childhood, and no immensity approaches the greatness of\r\nlittle children. Of all gulfs this is the deepest. The fearful\r\nperpetuity of the dead chained beyond life, the mighty animosity of the\r\nocean to a wreck, the whiteness of the snow over buried bodies, do not\r\nequal in pathos two children’s mouths meeting divinely in sleep,[10] and\r\nthe meeting of which is not even a kiss. A betrothal perchance,\r\nperchance a catastrophe. The unknown weighs down upon their\r\njuxtaposition. It charms, it terrifies; who knows which? It stays the\r\npulse. Innocence is higher than virtue. Innocence is holy ignorance.\r\nThey slept. They were in peace. They were warm. The nakedness of their\r\nbodies, embraced each in each, amalgamated with the virginity of their\r\nsouls. They were there as in the nest of the abyss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE AWAKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning of day is sinister. A sad pale light penetrated the hut.\r\nIt was the frozen dawn. That wan light which throws into relief the\r\nmournful reality of objects which are blurred into spectral forms by the\r\nnight, did not awake the children, so soundly were they sleeping. The\r\ncaravan was warm. Their breathings alternated like two peaceful waves.\r\nThere was no longer a hurricane without. The light of dawn was slowly\r\ntaking possession of the horizon. The constellations were being\r\nextinguished, like candles blown out one after the other. Only a few\r\nlarge stars resisted. The deep-toned song of the Infinite was coming\r\nfrom the sea.\r\n\r\nThe fire in the stove was not quite out. The twilight broke, little by\r\nlittle, into daylight. The boy slept less heavily than the girl. At\r\nlength, a ray brighter than the others broke through the pane, and he\r\nopened his eyes. The sleep of childhood ends in forgetfulness. He lay in\r\na state of semi-stupor, without knowing where he was or what was near\r\nhim, without making an effort to remember, gazing at the ceiling, and\r\nsetting himself an aimless task as he gazed dreamily at the letters of\r\nthe inscription--“Ursus, Philosopher”--which, being unable to read, he\r\nexamined without the power of deciphering.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the key turning in the lock caused him to turn his head.\r\n\r\nThe door turned on its hinges, the steps were let down. Ursus was\r\nreturning. He ascended the steps, his extinguished lantern in his hand.\r\nAt the same time the pattering of four paws fell upon the steps. It was\r\nHomo, following Ursus, who had also returned to his home.\r\n\r\nThe boy awoke with somewhat of a start. The wolf, having probably an\r\nappetite, gave him a morning yawn, showing two rows of very white teeth.\r\nHe stopped when he had got halfway up the steps, and placed both\r\nforepaws within the caravan, leaning on the threshold, like a preacher\r\nwith his elbows on the edge of the pulpit. He sniffed the chest from\r\nafar, not being in the habit of finding it occupied as it then was. His\r\nwolfine form, framed by the doorway, was designed in black against the\r\nlight of morning. He made up his mind, and entered. The boy, seeing the\r\nwolf in the caravan, got out of the bear-skin, and, standing up, placed\r\nhimself in front of the little infant, who was sleeping more soundly\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nUrsus had just hung the lantern up on a nail in the ceiling. Silently,\r\nand with mechanical deliberation, he unbuckled the belt in which was his\r\ncase, and replaced it on the shelf. He looked at nothing, and seemed to\r\nsee nothing. His eyes were glassy. Something was moving him deeply in\r\nhis mind. His thoughts at length found breath, as usual, in a rapid\r\noutflow of words. He exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“Happy, doubtless! Dead! stone dead!”\r\n\r\nHe bent down, and put a shovelful of turf mould into the stove; and as\r\nhe poked the peat he growled out,--\r\n\r\n“I had a deal of trouble to find her. The mischief of the unknown had\r\nburied her under two feet of snow. Had it not been for Homo, who sees as\r\nclearly with his nose as Christopher Columbus did with his mind, I\r\nshould be still there, scratching at the avalanche, and playing hide and\r\nseek with Death. Diogenes took his lantern and sought for a man; I took\r\nmy lantern and sought for a woman. He found a sarcasm, and I found\r\nmourning. How cold she was! I touched her hand--a stone! What silence in\r\nher eyes! How can any one be such a fool as to die and leave a child\r\nbehind? It will not be convenient to pack three into this box. A pretty\r\nfamily I have now! A boy and a girl!”\r\n\r\nWhilst Ursus was speaking, Homo sidled up close to the stove. The hand\r\nof the sleeping infant was hanging down between the stove and the chest.\r\nThe wolf set to licking it. He licked it so softly that he did not awake\r\nthe little infant.\r\n\r\nUrsus turned round.\r\n\r\n“Well done, Homo. I shall be father, and you shall be uncle.”\r\n\r\nThen he betook himself again to arranging the fire with philosophical\r\ncare, without interrupting his aside.\r\n\r\n“Adoption! It is settled; Homo is willing.”\r\n\r\nHe drew himself up.\r\n\r\n“I should like to know who is responsible for that woman’s death? Is it\r\nman? or....”\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes, but looked beyond the ceiling, and his lips\r\nmurmured,--\r\n\r\n“Is it Thou?”\r\n\r\nThen his brow dropped, as if under a burden, and he continued,--\r\n\r\n“The night took the trouble to kill the woman.”\r\n\r\nRaising his eyes, they met those of the boy, just awakened, who was\r\nlistening. Ursus addressed him abruptly,--\r\n\r\n“What are you laughing about?”\r\n\r\nThe boy answered,--\r\n\r\n“I am not laughing.”\r\n\r\nUrsus felt a kind of shock, looked at him fixedly for a few minutes, and\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n“Then you are frightful.”\r\n\r\nThe interior of the caravan, on the previous night, had been so dark\r\nthat Ursus had not yet seen the boy’s face. The broad daylight revealed\r\nit. He placed the palms of his hands on the two shoulders of the boy,\r\nand, examining his countenance more and more piercingly, exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“Do not laugh any more!”\r\n\r\n“I am not laughing,” said the child.\r\n\r\nUrsus was seized with a shudder from head to foot.\r\n\r\n“You do laugh, I tell you.”\r\n\r\nThen seizing the child with a grasp which would have been one of fury\r\nhad it not been one of pity, he asked him: roughly,--\r\n\r\n“Who did that to you?”\r\n\r\nThe child replied,--\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you mean.”\r\n\r\n“How long have you had that laugh?”\r\n\r\n“I have always been thus,” said the child.\r\n\r\nUrsus turned towards the chest, saying in a low voice,--\r\n\r\n“I thought that work was out of date.”\r\n\r\nHe took from the top of it, very softly, so as not to awaken the infant,\r\nthe book which he had placed there for a pillow.\r\n\r\n“Let us see Conquest,” he murmured.\r\n\r\nIt was a bundle of paper in folio, bound in soft parchment. He turned\r\nthe pages with his thumb, stopped at a certain one, opened the book wide\r\non the stove, and read,--\r\n\r\n“‘_De Denasatis_,’ it is here.”\r\n\r\nAnd he continued,--\r\n\r\n“_Bucca fissa usque ad aures, genezivis denudatis, nasoque murdridato,\r\nmasca eris, et ridebis semper_.”\r\n\r\n“There it is for certain.”\r\n\r\nThen he replaced the book on one of the shelves, growling.\r\n\r\n“It might not be wholesome to inquire too deeply into a case of the\r\nkind. We will remain on the surface. Laugh away, my boy!”\r\n\r\nJust then the little girl awoke. Her good-day was a cry.\r\n\r\n“Come, nurse, give her the breast,” said Ursus.\r\n\r\nThe infant sat up. Ursus taking the phial from the stove gave it to her\r\nto suck.\r\n\r\nThen the sun arose. He was level with the horizon. His red rays gleamed\r\nthrough the glass, and struck against the face of the infant, which was\r\nturned towards him. Her eyeballs, fixed on the sun, reflected his purple\r\norbit like two mirrors. The eyeballs were immovable, the eyelids also.\r\n\r\n“See!” said Ursus. “She is blind.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FIRST.\r\n\r\n_THE EVERLASTING PRESENCE OF THE\r\nPAST: MAN REFLECTS MAN_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nLORD CLANCHARLIE.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was, in those days, an old tradition.\r\n\r\nThat tradition was Lord Linnæus Clancharlie.\r\n\r\nLinnæus Baron Clancharlie, a contemporary of Cromwell, was one of the\r\npeers of England--few in number, be it said--who accepted the republic.\r\nThe reason of his acceptance of it might, indeed, for want of a better,\r\nbe found in the fact that for the time being the republic was\r\ntriumphant. It was a matter of course that Lord Clancharlie should\r\nadhere to the republic, as long as the republic had the upper hand; but\r\nafter the close of the revolution and the fall of the parliamentary\r\ngovernment, Lord Clancharlie had persisted in his fidelity to it. It\r\nwould have been easy for the noble patrician to re-enter the\r\nreconstituted upper house, repentance being ever well received on\r\nrestorations, and Charles II. being a kind prince enough to those who\r\nreturned to their allegiance to him; but Lord Clancharlie had failed to\r\nunderstand what was due to events. While the nation overwhelmed with\r\nacclamation the king come to retake possession of England, while\r\nunanimity was recording its verdict, while the people were bowing their\r\nsalutation to the monarchy, while the dynasty was rising anew amidst a\r\nglorious and triumphant recantation, at the moment when the past was\r\nbecoming the future, and the future becoming the past, that nobleman\r\nremained refractory. He turned his head away from all that joy, and\r\nvoluntarily exiled himself. While he could have been a peer, he\r\npreferred being an outlaw. Years had thus passed away. He had grown old\r\nin his fidelity to the dead republic, and was therefore crowned with the\r\nridicule which is the natural reward of such folly.\r\n\r\nHe had retired into Switzerland, and dwelt in a sort of lofty ruin on\r\nthe banks of the Lake of Geneva. He had chosen his dwelling in the most\r\nrugged nook of the lake, between Chillon, where is the dungeon of\r\nBonnivard, and Vevay, where is Ludlow’s tomb. The rugged Alps, filled\r\nwith twilight, winds, and clouds, were around him; and he lived there,\r\nhidden in the great shadows that fall from the mountains. He was rarely\r\nmet by any passer-by. The man was out of his country, almost out of his\r\ncentury. At that time, to those who understood and were posted in the\r\naffairs of the period, no resistance to established things was\r\njustifiable. England was happy; a restoration is as the reconciliation\r\nof husband and wife, prince and nation return to each other, no state\r\ncan be more graceful or more pleasant. Great Britain beamed with joy; to\r\nhave a king at all was a good deal--but furthermore, the king was a\r\ncharming one. Charles II. was amiable--a man of pleasure, yet able to\r\ngovern; and great, if not after the fashion of Louis XIV. He was\r\nessentially a gentleman. Charles II. was admired by his subjects. He had\r\nmade war in Hanover for reasons best known to himself; at least, no one\r\nelse knew them. He had sold Dunkirk to France, a manoeuvre of state\r\npolicy. The Whig peers, concerning whom Chamberlain says, “The cursed\r\nrepublic infected with its stinking breath several of the high\r\nnobility,” had had the good sense to bow to the inevitable, to conform\r\nto the times, and to resume their seats in the House of Lords. To do so,\r\nit sufficed that they should take the oath of allegiance to the king.\r\nWhen these facts were considered--the glorious reign, the excellent\r\nking, august princes given back by divine mercy to the people’s love;\r\nwhen it was remembered that persons of such consideration as Monk, and,\r\nlater on, Jeffreys, had rallied round the throne; that they had been\r\nproperly rewarded for their loyalty and zeal by the most splendid\r\nappointments and the most lucrative offices; that Lord Clancharlie could\r\nnot be ignorant of this, and that it only depended on himself to be\r\nseated by their side, glorious in his honours; that England had, thanks\r\nto her king, risen again to the summit of prosperity; that London was\r\nall banquets and carousals; that everybody was rich and enthusiastic,\r\nthat the court was gallant, gay, and magnificent;--if by chance, far\r\nfrom these splendours, in some melancholy, indescribable half-light,\r\nlike nightfall, that old man, clad in the same garb as the common\r\npeople, was observed pale, absent-minded, bent towards the grave,\r\nstanding on the shore of the lake, scarce heeding the storm and the\r\nwinter, walking as though at random, his eye fixed, his white hair\r\ntossed by the wind of the shadow, silent, pensive, solitary, who could\r\nforbear to smile?\r\n\r\nIt was the sketch of a madman.\r\n\r\nThinking of Lord Clancharlie, of what he might have been and what he\r\nwas, a smile was indulgent; some laughed out aloud, others could not\r\nrestrain their anger. It is easy to understand that men of sense were\r\nmuch shocked by the insolence implied by his isolation.\r\n\r\nOne extenuating circumstance: Lord Clancharlie had never had any brains.\r\nEvery one agreed on that point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is disagreeable to see one’s fellows practise obstinacy. Imitations\r\nof Regulus are not popular, and public opinion holds them in some\r\nderision. Stubborn people are like reproaches, and we have a right to\r\nlaugh at them.\r\n\r\nBesides, to sum up, are these perversities, these rugged notches,\r\nvirtues? Is there not in these excessive advertisements of\r\nself-abnegation and of honour a good deal of ostentation? It is all\r\nparade more than anything else. Why such exaggeration of solitude and\r\nexile? to carry nothing to extremes is the wise man’s maxim. Be in\r\nopposition if you choose, blame if you will, but decently, and crying\r\nout all the while “Long live the King.” The true virtue is common\r\nsense--what falls ought to fall, what succeeds ought to succeed.\r\nProvidence acts advisedly, it crowns him who deserves the crown; do you\r\npretend to know better than Providence? When matters are settled--when\r\none rule has replaced another--when success is the scale in which truth\r\nand falsehood are weighed, in one side the catastrophe, in the other\r\nthe triumph; then doubt is no longer possible, the honest man rallies to\r\nthe winning side, and although it may happen to serve his fortune and\r\nhis family, he does not allow himself to be influenced by that\r\nconsideration, but thinking only of the public weal, holds out his hand\r\nheartily to the conqueror.\r\n\r\nWhat would become of the state if no one consented to serve it? Would\r\nnot everything come to a standstill? To keep his place is the duty of a\r\ngood citizen. Learn to sacrifice your secret preferences. Appointments\r\nmust be filled, and some one must necessarily sacrifice himself. To be\r\nfaithful to public functions is true fidelity. The retirement of public\r\nofficials would paralyse the state. What! banish yourself!--how weak! As\r\nan example?--what vanity! As a defiance?--what audacity! What do you set\r\nyourself up to be, I wonder? Learn that we are just as good as you. If\r\nwe chose we too could be intractable and untameable and do worse things\r\nthan you; but we prefer to be sensible people. Because I am a\r\nTrimalcion, you think that I could not be a Cato! What nonsense!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever was a situation more clearly defined or more decisive than that of\r\n1660. Never had a course of conduct been more plainly indicated to a\r\nwell-ordered mind. England was out of Cromwell’s grasp. Under the\r\nrepublic many irregularities had been committed. British preponderance\r\nhad been created. With the aid of the Thirty Years’ War, Germany had\r\nbeen overcome; with the aid of the Fronde, France had been humiliated;\r\nwith the aid of the Duke of Braganza, the power of Spain had been\r\nlessened. Cromwell had tamed Mazarin; in signing treaties the Protector\r\nof England wrote his name above that of the King of France. The United\r\nProvinces had been put under a fine of eight millions; Algiers and Tunis\r\nhad been attacked; Jamaica conquered; Lisbon humbled; French rivalry\r\nencouraged in Barcelona, and Masaniello in Naples; Portugal had been\r\nmade fast to England; the seas had been swept of Barbary pirates from\r\nGibraltar to Crete; maritime domination had been founded under two\r\nforms, Victory and Commerce. On the 10th of August, 1653, the man of\r\nthirty-three victories, the old admiral who called himself the sailors’\r\ngrandfather, Martin Happertz van Tromp, who had beaten the Spanish, had\r\nbeen destroyed by the English fleet. The Atlantic had been cleared of\r\nthe Spanish navy, the Pacific of the Dutch, the Mediterranean of the\r\nVenetian, and by the patent of navigation, England had taken possession\r\nof the sea-coast of the world. By the ocean she commanded the world; at\r\nsea the Dutch flag humbly saluted the British flag. France, in the\r\nperson of the Ambassador Mancini, bent the knee to Oliver Cromwell; and\r\nCromwell played with Calais and Dunkirk as with two shuttlecocks on a\r\nbattledore. The Continent had been taught to tremble, peace had been\r\ndictated, war declared, the British Ensign raised on every pinnacle. By\r\nitself the Protector’s regiment of Ironsides weighed in the fears of\r\nEurope against an army. Cromwell used to say, “_I wish the Republic of\r\nEngland to be respected, as was respected the Republic of Rome_.” No\r\nlonger were delusions held sacred; speech was free, the press was free.\r\nIn the public street men said what they listed; they printed what they\r\npleased without control or censorship. The equilibrium of thrones had\r\nbeen destroyed. The whole order of European monarchy, in which the\r\nStuarts formed a link, had been overturned. But at last England had\r\nemerged from this odious order of things, and had won its pardon.\r\n\r\nThe indulgent Charles II. had granted the declaration of Breda. He had\r\nconceded to England oblivion of the period in which the son of the\r\nHuntingdon brewer placed his foot on the neck of Louis XIV. England said\r\nits mea culpa, and breathed again. The cup of joy was, as we have just\r\nsaid, full; gibbets for the regicides adding to the universal delight. A\r\nrestoration is a smile; but a few gibbets are not out of place, and\r\nsatisfaction is due to the conscience of the public. To be good subjects\r\nwas thenceforth the people’s sole ambition. The spirit of lawlessness\r\nhad been expelled. Royalty was reconstituted. Men had recovered from the\r\nfollies of politics. They mocked at revolution, they jeered at the\r\nrepublic, and as to those times when such strange words as _Right,\r\nLiberty, Progress_, had been in the mouth--why, they laughed at such\r\nbombast! Admirable was the return to common sense. England had been in a\r\ndream. What joy to be quit of such errors! Was ever anything so mad?\r\nWhere should we be if every one had his rights? Fancy every one’s\r\nhaving a hand in the government? Can you imagine a city ruled by its\r\ncitizens? Why, the citizens are the team, and the team cannot be driver.\r\nTo put to the vote is to throw to the winds. Would you have states\r\ndriven like clouds? Disorder cannot build up order. With chaos for an\r\narchitect, the edifice would be a Babel. And, besides, what tyranny is\r\nthis pretended liberty! As for me, I wish to enjoy myself; not to\r\ngovern. It is a bore to have to vote; I want to dance. A prince is a\r\nprovidence, and takes care of us all. Truly the king is generous to take\r\nso much trouble for our sakes. Besides, he is to the manner born. He\r\nknows what it is. It’s his business. Peace, War, Legislation,\r\nFinance--what have the people to do with such things? Of course the\r\npeople have to pay; of course the people have to serve; but that should\r\nsuffice them. They have a place in policy; from them come two essential\r\nthings, the army and the budget. To be liable to contribute, and to be\r\nliable to serve; is not that enough? What more should they want? They\r\nare the military and the financial arm. A magnificent _rôle_. The king\r\nreigns for them, and they must reward him accordingly. Taxation and the\r\ncivil list are the salaries paid by the peoples and earned by the\r\nprince. The people give their blood and their money, in return for which\r\nthey are led. To wish to lead themselves! what an absurd idea! They\r\nrequire a guide; being ignorant, they are blind. Has not the blind man\r\nhis dog? Only the people have a lion, the king, who consents to act the\r\ndog. How kind of him! But why are the people ignorant? because it is\r\ngood for them. Ignorance is the guardian of Virtue. Where there is no\r\nperspective there is no ambition. The ignorant man is in useful\r\ndarkness, which, suppressing sight, suppresses covetousness: whence\r\ninnocence. He who reads, thinks; who thinks, reasons. But not to reason\r\nis duty; and happiness as well. These truths are incontestable; society\r\nis based on them.\r\n\r\nThus had sound social doctrines been re-established in England; thus had\r\nthe nation been reinstated. At the same time a correct taste in\r\nliterature was reviving. Shakespeare was despised, Dryden admired.\r\n“_Dryden is the greatest poet of England, and of the century_,” said\r\nAtterbury, the translator of “Achitophel.” It was about the time when M.\r\nHuet, Bishop of Avranches, wrote to Saumaise, who had done the author\r\nof “Paradise Lost” the honour to refute and abuse him, “_How can you\r\ntrouble yourself about so mean a thing as that Milton?_” Everything was\r\nfalling into its proper place: Dryden above, Shakespeare below; Charles\r\nII. on the throne, Cromwell on the gibbet. England was raising herself\r\nout of the shame and the excesses of the past. It is a great happiness\r\nfor nations to be led back by monarchy to good order in the state and\r\ngood taste in letters.\r\n\r\nThat such benefits should be misunderstood is difficult to believe. To\r\nturn the cold shoulder to Charles II., to reward with ingratitude the\r\nmagnanimity which he displayed in ascending the throne--was not such\r\nconduct abominable? Lord Linnæus Clancharlie had inflicted this vexation\r\nupon honest men. To sulk at his country’s happiness, alack, what\r\naberration!\r\n\r\nWe know that in 1650 Parliament had drawn up this form of declaration:\r\n“_I promise to remain faithful to the republic, without king, sovereign,\r\nor lord_.” Under pretext of having taken this monstrous oath, Lord\r\nClancharlie was living out of the kingdom, and, in the face of the\r\ngeneral joy, thought that he had the right to be sad. He had a morose\r\nesteem for that which was no more, and was absurdly attached to things\r\nwhich had been.\r\n\r\nTo excuse him was impossible. The kindest-hearted abandoned him; his\r\nfriends had long done him the honour to believe that he had entered the\r\nrepublican ranks only to observe the more closely the flaws in the\r\nrepublican armour, and to smite it the more surely, when the day should\r\ncome, for the sacred cause of the king. These lurkings in ambush for the\r\nconvenient hour to strike the enemy a death-blow in the back are\r\nattributes to loyalty. Such a line of conduct had been expected of Lord\r\nClancharlie, so strong was the wish to judge him favourably; but, in the\r\nface of his strange persistence in republicanism, people were obliged to\r\nlower their estimate. Evidently Lord Clancharlie was confirmed in his\r\nconvictions--that is to say, an idiot!\r\n\r\nThe explanation given by the indulgent, wavered between puerile\r\nstubbornness and senile obstinacy.\r\n\r\nThe severe and the just went further; they blighted the name of the\r\nrenegade. Folly has its rights, but it has also its limits. A man may be\r\na brute, but he has no right to be a rebel. And, after all, what was\r\nthis Lord Clancharlie? A deserter. He had fled his camp, the\r\naristocracy, for that of the enemy, the people. This faithful man was a\r\ntraitor. It is true that he was a traitor to the stronger, and faithful\r\nto the weaker; it is true that the camp repudiated by him was the\r\nconquering camp, and the camp adopted by him, the conquered; it is true\r\nthat by his treason he lost everything--his political privileges and his\r\ndomestic hearth, his title and his country. He gained nothing but\r\nridicule, he attained no benefit but exile. But what does all this\r\nprove?--that he was a fool. Granted.\r\n\r\nPlainly a dupe and traitor in one. Let a man be as great a fool as he\r\nlikes, so that he does not set a bad example. Fools need only be civil,\r\nand in consideration thereof they may aim at being the basis of\r\nmonarchies. The narrowness of Clancharlie’s mind was incomprehensible.\r\nHis eyes were still dazzled by the phantasmagoria of the revolution. He\r\nhad allowed himself to be taken in by the republic--yes; and cast out.\r\nHe was an affront to his country. The attitude he assumed was downright\r\nfelony. Absence was an insult. He held aloof from the public joy as from\r\nthe plague. In his voluntary banishment he found some indescribable\r\nrefuge from the national rejoicing. He treated loyalty as a contagion;\r\nover the widespread gladness at the revival of the monarchy, denounced\r\nby him as a lazaretto, he was the black flag. What! could he look thus\r\naskance at order reconstituted, a nation exalted, and a religion\r\nrestored? Over such serenity why cast his shadow? Take umbrage at\r\nEngland’s contentment! Must he be the one blot in the clear blue sky! Be\r\nas a threat! Protest against a nation’s will! refuse his Yes to the\r\nuniversal consent! It would be disgusting, if it were not the part of a\r\nfool. Clancharlie could not have taken into account the fact that it did\r\nnot matter if one had taken the wrong turn with Cromwell, as long as one\r\nfound one’s way back into the right path with Monk.\r\n\r\nTake Monk’s case. He commands the republican army. Charles II., having\r\nbeen informed of his honesty, writes to him. Monk, who combines virtue\r\nwith tact, dissimulates at first, then suddenly at the head of his\r\ntroops dissolves the rebel parliament, and re-establishes the king on\r\nthe throne. Monk is created Duke of Albemarle, has the honour of having\r\nsaved society, becomes very rich, sheds a glory over his own time, is\r\ncreated Knight of the Garter, and has the prospect of being buried in\r\nWestminster Abbey. Such glory is the reward of British fidelity!\r\n\r\nLord Clancharlie could never rise to a sense of duty thus carried out.\r\nHe had the infatuation and obstinacy of an exile. He contented himself\r\nwith hollow phrases. He was tongue-tied by pride. The words conscience\r\nand dignity are but words, after all. One must penetrate to the depths.\r\nThese depths Lord Clancharlie had not reached. His “eye was single,” and\r\nbefore committing an act he wished to observe it so closely as to be\r\nable to judge it by more senses than one. Hence arose absurd disgust to\r\nthe facts examined. No man can be a statesman who gives way to such\r\noverstrained delicacy. Excess of conscientiousness degenerates into\r\ninfirmity. Scruple is one-handed when a sceptre is to be seized, and a\r\neunuch when fortune is to be wedded. Distrust scruples; they drag you\r\ntoo far. Unreasonable fidelity is like a ladder leading into a\r\ncavern--one step down, another, then another, and there you are in the\r\ndark. The clever reascend; fools remain in it. Conscience must not be\r\nallowed to practise such austerity. If it be, it will fall until, from\r\ntransition to transition, it at length reaches the deep gloom of\r\npolitical prudery. Then one is lost. Thus it was with Lord Clancharlie.\r\n\r\nPrinciples terminate in a precipice.\r\n\r\nHe was walking, his hands behind him, along the shores of the Lake of\r\nGeneva. A fine way of getting on!\r\n\r\nIn London they sometimes spoke of the exile. He was accused before the\r\ntribunal of public opinion. They pleaded for and against him. The cause\r\nhaving been heard, he was acquitted on the ground of stupidity.\r\n\r\nMany zealous friends of the former republic had given their adherence to\r\nthe Stuarts. For this they deserve praise. They naturally calumniated\r\nhim a little. The obstinate are repulsive to the compliant. Men of\r\nsense, in favour and good places at Court, weary of his disagreeable\r\nattitude, took pleasure in saying, “_If he has not rallied to the\r\nthrone, it is because he has not been sufficiently paid_,” _etc_. “_He\r\nwanted the chancellorship which the king has given to Hyde_.” One of his\r\nold friends went so far as to whisper, “_He told me so himself_.” Remote\r\nas was the solitude of Linnæus Clancharlie, something of this talk\r\nwould reach him through the outlaws he met, such as old regicides like\r\nAndrew Broughton, who lived at Lausanne. Clancharlie confined himself to\r\nan imperceptible shrug of the shoulders, a sign of profound\r\ndeterioration. On one occasion he added to the shrug these few words,\r\nmurmured in a low voice, “I pity those who believe such things.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles II., good man! despised him. The happiness of England under\r\nCharles II. was more than happiness, it was enchantment. A restoration\r\nis like an old oil painting, blackened by time, and revarnished. All the\r\npast reappeared, good old manners returned, beautiful women reigned and\r\ngoverned. Evelyn notices it. We read in his journal, “Luxury,\r\nprofaneness, contempt of God. I saw the king on Sunday evening with his\r\ncourtesans, Portsmouth, Cleveland, Mazarin, and two or three others, all\r\nnearly naked, in the gaming-room.” We feel that there is ill-nature in\r\nthis description, for Evelyn was a grumbling Puritan, tainted with\r\nrepublican reveries. He did not appreciate the profitable example given\r\nby kings in those grand Babylonian gaieties, which, after all, maintain\r\nluxury. He did not understand the utility of vice. Here is a maxim: Do\r\nnot extirpate vice, if you want to have charming women; if you do you\r\nare like idiots who destroy the chrysalis whilst they delight in the\r\nbutterfly.\r\n\r\nCharles II., as we have said, scarcely remembered that a rebel called\r\nClancharlie existed; but James II. was more heedful. Charles II.\r\ngoverned gently, it was his way; we may add, that he did not govern the\r\nworse on that account. A sailor sometimes makes on a rope intended to\r\nbaffle the wind, a slack knot which he leaves to the wind to tighten.\r\nSuch is the stupidity of the storm and of the people.\r\n\r\nThe slack knot very soon becomes a tight one. So did the government of\r\nCharles II.\r\n\r\nUnder James II. the throttling began; a necessary throttling of what\r\nremained of the revolution. James II. had a laudable ambition to be an\r\nefficient king. The reign of Charles II. was, in his opinion, but a\r\nsketch of restoration. James wished for a still more complete return to\r\norder. He had, in 1660, deplored that they had confined themselves to\r\nthe hanging of ten regicides. He was a more genuine reconstructor of\r\nauthority. He infused vigour into serious principles. He installed true\r\njustice, which is superior to sentimental declamations, and attends,\r\nabove all things, to the interests of society. In his protecting\r\nseverities we recognize the father of the state. He entrusted the hand\r\nof justice to Jeffreys, and its sword to Kirke. That useful Colonel, one\r\nday, hung and rehung the same man, a republican, asking him each time,\r\n“Will you renounce the republic?” The villain, having each time said\r\n“No,” was dispatched. “_I hanged him four times_,” said Kirke, with\r\nsatisfaction. The renewal of executions is a great sign of power in the\r\nexecutive authority. Lady Lisle, who, though she had sent her son to\r\nfight against Monmouth, had concealed two rebels in her house, was\r\nexecuted; another rebel, having been honourable enough to declare that\r\nan Anabaptist female had given him shelter, was pardoned, and the woman\r\nwas burned alive. Kirke, on another occasion, gave a town to understand\r\nthat he knew its principles to be republican, by hanging nineteen\r\nburgesses. These reprisals were certainly legitimate, for it must be\r\nremembered that, under Cromwell, they cut off the noses and ears of the\r\nstone saints in the churches. James II., who had had the sense to choose\r\nJeffreys and Kirke, was a prince imbued with true religion; he practised\r\nmortification in the ugliness of his mistresses; he listened to le Père\r\nla Colombière, a preacher almost as unctuous as le Père Cheminais, but\r\nwith more fire, who had the glory of being, during the first part of his\r\nlife, the counsellor of James II., and, during the latter, the inspirer\r\nof Mary Alcock. It was, thanks to this strong religious nourishment,\r\nthat, later on, James II. was enabled to bear exile with dignity, and to\r\nexhibit, in his retirement at Saint Germain, the spectacle of a king\r\nrising superior to adversity, calmly touching for king’s evil, and\r\nconversing with Jesuits.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that such a king would trouble himself to\r\na certain extent about such a rebel as Lord Linnæus Clancharlie.\r\nHereditary peerages have a certain hold on the future, and it was\r\nevident that if any precautions were necessary with regard to that lord,\r\nJames II. was not the man to hesitate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLORD DAVID DIRRY-MOIR.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Linnæus Clancharlie had not always been old and proscribed; he had\r\nhad his phase of youth and passion. We know from Harrison and Pride that\r\nCromwell, when young, loved women and pleasure, a taste which, at times\r\n(another reading of the text “Woman”), betrays a seditious man. Distrust\r\nthe loosely-clasped girdle. _Male proecinctam juvenem cavete_. Lord\r\nClancharlie, like Cromwell, had had his wild hours and his\r\nirregularities. He was known to have had a natural child, a son. This\r\nson was born in England in the last days of the republic, just as his\r\nfather was going into exile. Hence he had never seen his father. This\r\nbastard of Lord Clancharlie had grown up as page at the court of Charles\r\nII. He was styled Lord David Dirry-Moir: he was a lord by courtesy, his\r\nmother being a woman of quality. The mother, while Lord Clancharlie was\r\nbecoming an owl in Switzerland, made up her mind, being a beauty, to\r\ngive over sulking, and was forgiven that Goth, her first lover, by one\r\nundeniably polished and at the same time a royalist, for it was the king\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nShe had been but a short time the mistress of Charles II., sufficiently\r\nlong however to have made his Majesty--who was delighted to have won so\r\npretty a woman from the republic--bestow on the little Lord David, the\r\nson of his conquest, the office of keeper of the stick, which made that\r\nbastard officer, boarded at the king’s expense, by a natural revulsion\r\nof feeling, an ardent adherent of the Stuarts. Lord David was for some\r\ntime one of the hundred and seventy wearing the great sword, while\r\nafterwards, entering the corps of pensioners, he became one of the forty\r\nwho bear the gilded halberd. He had, besides being one of the noble\r\ncompany instituted by Henry VIII. as a bodyguard, the privilege of\r\nlaying the dishes on the king’s table. Thus it was that whilst his\r\nfather was growing gray in exile, Lord David prospered under Charles II.\r\n\r\nAfter which he prospered under James II.\r\n\r\nThe king is dead. Long live the king! It is the _non deficit alter,\r\naureus_.\r\n\r\nIt was on the accession of the Duke of York that he obtained permission\r\nto call himself Lord David Dirry-Moir, from an estate which his mother,\r\nwho had just died, had left him, in that great forest of Scotland, where\r\nis found the krag, a bird which scoops out a nest with its beak in the\r\ntrunk of the oak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames II. was a king, and affected to be a general. He loved to surround\r\nhimself with young officers. He showed himself frequently in public on\r\nhorseback, in a helmet and cuirass, with a huge projecting wig hanging\r\nbelow the helmet and over the cuirass--a sort of equestrian statue of\r\nimbecile war. He took a fancy to the graceful mien of the young Lord\r\nDavid. He liked the royalist for being the son of a republican. The\r\nrepudiation of a father does not damage the foundation of a court\r\nfortune. The king made Lord David gentleman of the bedchamber, at a\r\nsalary of a thousand a year.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine promotion. A gentleman of the bedchamber sleeps near the\r\nking every night, on a bed which is made up for him. There are twelve\r\ngentlemen who relieve each other.\r\n\r\nLord David, whilst he held that post, was also head of the king’s\r\ngranary, giving out corn for the horses and receiving a salary of £260.\r\nUnder him were the five coachmen of the king, the five postilions of the\r\nking, the five grooms of the king, the twelve footmen of the king, and\r\nthe four chair-bearers of the king. He had the management of the\r\nrace-horses which the king kept at Newmarket, and which cost his\r\nMajesty £600 a year. He worked his will on the king’s wardrobe, from\r\nwhich the Knights of the Garter are furnished with their robes of\r\nceremony. He was saluted to the ground by the usher of the Black Rod,\r\nwho belongs to the king. That usher, under James II., was the knight of\r\nDuppa. Mr. Baker, who was clerk of the crown, and Mr. Brown, who was\r\nclerk of the Parliament, kotowed to Lord David. The court of England,\r\nwhich is magnificent, is a model of hospitality. Lord David presided, as\r\none of the twelve, at banquets and receptions. He had the glory of\r\nstanding behind the king on offertory days, when the king give to the\r\nchurch the golden _byzantium_; on collar-days, when the king wears the\r\ncollar of his order; on communion days, when no one takes the sacrament\r\nexcepting the king and the princes. It was he who, on Holy Thursday,\r\nintroduced into his Majesty’s presence the twelve poor men to whom the\r\nking gives as many silver pence as the years of his age, and as many\r\nshillings as the years of his reign. The duty devolved on him when the\r\nking was ill, to call to the assistance of his Majesty the two grooms of\r\nthe almonry, who are priests, and to prevent the approach of doctors\r\nwithout permission from the council of state. Besides, he was\r\nlieutenant-colonel of the Scotch regiment of Guards, the one which plays\r\nthe Scottish march. As such, he made several campaigns, and with glory,\r\nfor he was a gallant soldier. He was a brave lord, well-made, handsome,\r\ngenerous, and majestic in look and in manner. His person was like his\r\nquality. He was tall in stature as well as high in birth.\r\n\r\nAt one time he stood a chance of being made groom of the stole, which\r\nwould have given him the privilege of putting the king’s shirt on his\r\nMajesty: but to hold that office it was necessary to be either prince or\r\npeer. Now, to create a peer is a serious thing; it is to create a\r\npeerage, and that makes many people jealous. It is a favour; a favour\r\nwhich gives the king one friend and a hundred enemies, without taking\r\ninto account that the one friend becomes ungrateful. James II., from\r\npolicy, was indisposed to create peerages, but he transferred them\r\nfreely. The transfer of a peerage produces no sensation. It is simply\r\nthe continuation of a name. The order is little affected by it.\r\n\r\nThe goodwill of royalty had no objection to raise Lord David Dirry-Moir\r\nto the Upper House so long as it could do so by means of a substituted\r\npeerage. Nothing would have pleased his majesty better than to transform\r\nLord David Dirry-Moir, lord by courtesy, into a lord by right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opportunity occurred.\r\n\r\nOne day it was announced that several things had happened to the old\r\nexile, Lord Clancharlie, the most important of which was that he was\r\ndead. Death does just this much good to folks: it causes a little talk\r\nabout them. People related what they knew, or what they thought they\r\nknew, of the last years of Lord Linnæus. What they said was probably\r\nlegend and conjecture. If these random tales were to be credited, Lord\r\nClancharlie must have had his republicanism intensified towards the end\r\nof his life, to the extent of marrying (strange obstinacy of the exile!)\r\nAnn Bradshaw, the daughter of a regicide; they were precise about the\r\nname. She had also died, it was said, but in giving birth to a boy. If\r\nthese details should prove to be correct, his child would of course be\r\nthe legitimate and rightful heir of Lord Clancharlie. These reports,\r\nhowever, were extremely vague in form, and were rumours rather than\r\nfacts. Circumstances which happened in Switzerland, in those days, were\r\nas remote from the England of that period as those which take place in\r\nChina from the England of to-day. Lord Clancharlie must have been\r\nfifty-nine at the time of his marriage, they said, and sixty at the\r\nbirth of his son, and must have died shortly after, leaving his infant\r\norphaned both of father and mother. This was possible, perhaps, but\r\nimprobable. They added that the child was beautiful as the day,--just as\r\nwe read in all the fairy tales. King James put an end to these rumours,\r\nevidently without foundation, by declaring, one fine morning, Lord David\r\nDirry-Moir sole and positive heir _in default of legitimate issue_, and\r\nby his royal pleasure, of Lord Linnæus Clancharlie, his natural father,\r\n_the absence of all other issue and descent being established_, patents\r\nof which grant were registered in the House of Lords. By these patents\r\nthe king instituted Lord David Dirry-Moir in the titles, rights, and\r\nprerogatives of the late Lord Linnæus Clancharlie, on the sole\r\ncondition that Lord David should wed, when she attained a marriageable\r\nage, a girl who was, at that time, a mere infant a few months old, and\r\nwhom the king had, in her cradle, created a duchess, no one knew exactly\r\nwhy; or, rather, every one knew why. This little infant was called the\r\nDuchess Josiana.\r\n\r\nThe English fashion then ran on Spanish names. One of Charles II.’s\r\nbastards was called Carlos, Earl of Plymouth. It is likely that Josiana\r\nwas a contraction for Josefa-y-Ana. Josiana, however, may have been a\r\nname--the feminine of Josias. One of Henry VIII.’s gentlemen was called\r\nJosias du Passage.\r\n\r\nIt was to this little duchess that the king granted the peerage of\r\nClancharlie. She was a peeress till there should be a peer; the peer\r\nshould be her husband. The peerage was founded on a double castleward,\r\nthe barony of Clancharlie and the barony of Hunkerville; besides, the\r\nbarons of Clancharlie were, in recompense of an ancient feat of arms,\r\nand by royal licence, Marquises of Corleone, in Sicily.\r\n\r\nPeers of England cannot bear foreign titles; there are, nevertheless,\r\nexceptions; thus--Henry Arundel, Baron Arundel of Wardour, was, as well\r\nas Lord Clifford, a Count of the Holy Roman Empire, of which Lord Cowper\r\nis a prince. The Duke of Hamilton is Duke of Chatelherault, in France;\r\nBasil Fielding, Earl of Denbigh, is Count of Hapsburg, of Lauffenberg,\r\nand of Rheinfelden, in Germany. The Duke of Marlborough was Prince of\r\nMindelheim, in Suabia, just as the Duke of Wellington was Prince of\r\nWaterloo, in Belgium. The same Lord Wellington was a Spanish Duke of\r\nCiudad Rodrigo, and Portuguese Count of Vimiera.\r\n\r\nThere were in England, and there are still, lands both noble and common.\r\nThe lands of the Lords of Clancharlie were all noble. These lands,\r\nburghs, bailiwicks, fiefs, rents, freeholds, and domains, adherent to\r\nthe peerage of Clancharlie-Hunkerville, belonged provisionally to Lady\r\nJosiana, and the king declared that, once married to Josiana, Lord David\r\nDirry-Moir should be Baron Clancharlie.\r\n\r\nBesides the Clancharlie inheritance, Lady Josiana had her own fortune.\r\nShe possessed great wealth, much of which was derived from the gifts of\r\n_Madame sans queue_ to the Duke of York. _Madame sans queue_ is short\r\nfor Madame. Henrietta of England, Duchess of Orleans, the lady of\r\nhighest rank in France after the queen, was thus called.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving prospered under Charles and James, Lord David prospered under\r\nWilliam. His Jacobite feeling did not reach to the extent of following\r\nJames into exile. While he continued to love his legitimate king, he had\r\nthe good sense to serve the usurper; he was, moreover, although\r\nsometimes disposed to rebel against discipline, an excellent officer. He\r\npassed from the land to the sea forces, and distinguished himself in the\r\nWhite Squadron. He rose in it to be what was then called captain of a\r\nlight frigate. Altogether he made a very fine fellow, carrying to a\r\ngreat extent the elegancies of vice: a bit of a poet, like every one\r\nelse; a good servant of the state, a good servant to the prince;\r\nassiduous at feasts, at galas, at ladies’ receptions, at ceremonies,\r\nand in battle; servile in a gentlemanlike way; very haughty; with\r\neyesight dull or keen, according to the object examined; inclined to\r\nintegrity; obsequious or arrogant, as occasion required; frank and\r\nsincere on first acquaintance, with the power of assuming the mask\r\nafterwards; very observant of the smiles and frowns of the royal humour;\r\ncareless before a sword’s point; always ready to risk his life on a sign\r\nfrom his Majesty with heroism and complacency, capable of any insult but\r\nof no impoliteness; a man of courtesy and etiquette, proud of kneeling\r\nat great regal ceremonies; of a gay valour; a courtier on the surface, a\r\npaladin below; quite young at forty-five. Lord David sang French songs,\r\nan elegant gaiety which had delighted Charles II. He loved eloquence and\r\nfine language. He greatly admired those celebrated discourses which are\r\ncalled the funeral orations of Bossuet.\r\n\r\nFrom his mother he had inherited almost enough to live on, about £10,000\r\na year. He managed to get on with it--by running into debt. In\r\nmagnificence, extravagance, and novelty he was without a rival. Directly\r\nhe was copied he changed his fashion. On horseback he wore loose boots\r\nof cow-hide, which turned over, with spurs. He had hats like nobody\r\nelse’s, unheard-of lace, and bands of which he alone had the pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE DUCHESS JOSIANA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards 1705, although Lady Josiana was twenty-three and Lord David\r\nforty-four, the wedding had not yet taken place, and that for the best\r\nreasons in the world. Did they hate each other? Far from it; but what\r\ncannot escape from you inspires you with no haste to obtain it. Josiana\r\nwanted to remain free, David to remain young. To have no tie until as\r\nlate as possible appeared to him to be a prolongation of youth.\r\nMiddle-aged young men abounded in those rakish times. They grew gray as\r\nyoung fops. The wig was an accomplice: later on, powder became the\r\nauxiliary. At fifty-five Lord Charles Gerrard, Baron Gerrard, one of the\r\nGerrards of Bromley, filled London with his successes. The young and\r\npretty Duchess of Buckingham, Countess of Coventry, made a fool of\r\nherself for love of the handsome Thomas Bellasys, Viscount Falconberg,\r\nwho was sixty-seven. People quoted the famous verses of Corneille, the\r\nseptuagenarian, to a girl of twenty--“_Marquise, si mon visage_.” Women,\r\ntoo, had their successes in the autumn of life. Witness Ninon and\r\nMarion. Such were the models of the day.\r\n\r\nJosiana and David carried on a flirtation of a particular shade. They\r\ndid not love, they pleased, each other. To be at each other’s side\r\nsufficed them. Why hasten the conclusion? The novels of those days\r\ncarried lovers and engaged couples to that kind of stage which was the\r\nmost becoming. Besides, Josiana, while she knew herself to be a bastard,\r\nfelt herself a princess, and carried her authority over him with a high\r\ntone in all their arrangements. She had a fancy for Lord David. Lord\r\nDavid was handsome, but that was over and above the bargain. She\r\nconsidered him to be fashionable.\r\n\r\nTo be fashionable is everything. Caliban, fashionable and magnificent,\r\nwould distance Ariel, poor. Lord David was handsome, so much the better.\r\nThe danger in being handsome is being insipid; and that he was not. He\r\nbetted, boxed, ran into debt. Josiana thought great things of his\r\nhorses, his dogs, his losses at play, his mistresses. Lord David, on his\r\nside, bowed down before the fascinations of the Duchess Josiana--a\r\nmaiden without spot or scruple, haughty, inaccessible, and audacious. He\r\naddressed sonnets to her, which Josiana sometimes read. In these sonnets\r\nhe declared that to possess Josiana would be to rise to the stars, which\r\ndid not prevent his always putting the ascent off to the following year.\r\nHe waited in the antechamber outside Josiana’s heart; and this suited\r\nthe convenience of both. At court all admired the good taste of this\r\ndelay. Lady Josiana said, “It is a bore that I should be obliged to\r\nmarry Lord David; I, who would desire nothing better than to be in love\r\nwith him!”\r\n\r\nJosiana was “the flesh.” Nothing could be more resplendent. She was very\r\ntall--too tall. Her hair was of that tinge which might be called red\r\ngold. She was plump, fresh, strong, and rosy, with immense boldness and\r\nwit. She had eyes which were too intelligible. She had neither lovers\r\nnor chastity. She walled herself round with pride. Men! oh, fie! a god\r\nonly would be worthy of her, or a monster. If virtue consists in the\r\nprotection of an inaccessible position, Josiana possessed all possible\r\nvirtue, but without any innocence. She disdained intrigues; but she\r\nwould not have been displeased had she been supposed to have engaged in\r\nsome, provided that the objects were uncommon, and proportioned to the\r\nmerits of one so highly placed. She thought little of her reputation,\r\nbut much of her glory. To appear yielding, and to be unapproachable, is\r\nperfection. Josiana felt herself majestic and material. Hers was a\r\ncumbrous beauty. She usurped rather than charmed. She trod upon hearts.\r\nShe was earthly. She would have been as much astonished at being proved\r\nto have a soul in her bosom as wings on her back. She discoursed on\r\nLocke; she was polite; she was suspected of knowing Arabic.\r\n\r\nTo be “the flesh” and to be woman are two different things. Where a\r\nwoman is vulnerable, on the side of pity, for instance, which so readily\r\nturns to love, Josiana was not. Not that she was unfeeling. The ancient\r\ncomparison of flesh to marble is absolutely false. The beauty of flesh\r\nconsists in not being marble: its beauty is to palpitate, to tremble, to\r\nblush, to bleed, to have firmness without hardness, to be white without\r\nbeing cold, to have its sensations and its infirmities; its beauty is to\r\nbe life, and marble is death.\r\n\r\nFlesh, when it attains a certain degree of beauty, has almost a claim to\r\nthe right of nudity; it conceals itself in its own dazzling charms as in\r\na veil. He who might have looked upon Josiana nude would have perceived\r\nher outlines only through a surrounding glory. She would have shown\r\nherself without hesitation to a satyr or a eunuch. She had the\r\nself-possession of a goddess. To have made her nudity a torment, ever\r\neluding a pursuing Tantalus, would have been an amusement to her.\r\n\r\nThe king had made her a duchess, and Jupiter a Nereid--a double\r\nirradiation of which the strange, brightness of this creature was\r\ncomposed. In admiring her you felt yourself becoming a pagan and a\r\nlackey. Her origin had been bastardy and the ocean. She appeared to have\r\nemerged from the foam. From the stream had risen the first jet of her\r\ndestiny; but the spring was royal. In her there was something of the\r\nwave, of chance, of the patrician, and of the tempest. She was well read\r\nand accomplished. Never had a passion approached her, yet she had\r\nsounded them all. She had a disgust for realizations, and at the same\r\ntime a taste for them. If she had stabbed herself, it would, like\r\nLucretia, not have been until afterwards. She was a virgin stained with\r\nevery defilement in its visionary stage. She was a possible Astarte in a\r\nreal Diana. She was, in the insolence of high birth, tempting and\r\ninaccessible. Nevertheless, she might find it amusing to plan a fall for\r\nherself. She dwelt in a halo of glory, half wishing to descend from it,\r\nand perhaps feeling curious to know what a fall was like. She was a\r\nlittle too heavy for her cloud. To err is a diversion. Princely\r\nunconstraint has the privilege of experiment, and what is frailty in a\r\nplebeian is only frolic in a duchess. Josiana was in everything--in\r\nbirth, in beauty, in irony, in brilliancy--almost a queen. She had felt\r\na moment’s enthusiasm for Louis de Bouffles, who used to break\r\nhorseshoes between his fingers. She regretted that Hercules was dead.\r\nShe lived in some undefined expectation of a voluptuous and supreme\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nMorally, Josiana brought to one’s mind the line--\r\n\r\n  “Un beau torse de femme en hydre se termine.”\r\n\r\nHers was a noble neck, a splendid bosom, heaving harmoniously over a\r\nroyal heart, a glance full of life and light, a countenance pure and\r\nhaughty, and who knows? below the surface was there not, in a\r\nsemi-transparent and misty depth, an undulating, supernatural\r\nprolongation, perchance deformed and dragon-like--a proud virtue ending\r\nin vice in the depth of dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all that she was a prude.\r\n\r\nIt was the fashion.\r\n\r\nRemember Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was of a type that prevailed in England for three\r\ncenturies--the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth. Elizabeth was\r\nmore than English--she was Anglican. Hence the deep respect of the\r\nEpiscopalian Church for that queen--respect resented by the Church of\r\nRome, which counterbalanced it with a dash of excommunication. In the\r\nmouth of Sixtus V., when anathematizing Elizabeth, malediction turned to\r\nmadrigal. “_Un gran cervello di principessa_,” he says. Mary Stuart,\r\nless concerned with the church and more with the woman part of the\r\nquestion, had little respect for her sister Elizabeth, and wrote to her\r\nas queen to queen and coquette to prude: “Your disinclination to\r\nmarriage arises from your not wishing to lose the liberty of being made\r\nlove to.” Mary Stuart played with the fan, Elizabeth with the axe. An\r\nuneven match. They were rivals, besides, in literature. Mary Stuart\r\ncomposed French verses; Elizabeth translated Horace. The ugly Elizabeth\r\ndecreed herself beautiful; liked quatrains and acrostics; had the keys\r\nof towns presented to her by cupids; bit her lips after the Italian\r\nfashion, rolled her eyes after the Spanish; had in her wardrobe three\r\nthousand dresses and costumes, of which several were for the character\r\nof Minerva and Amphitrite; esteemed the Irish for the width of their\r\nshoulders; covered her farthingale with braids and spangles; loved\r\nroses; cursed, swore, and stamped; struck her maids of honour with her\r\nclenched fists; used to send Dudley to the devil; beat Burleigh, the\r\nChancellor, who would cry--poor old fool! spat on Matthew; collared\r\nHatton; boxed the ears of Essex; showed her legs to Bassompierre; and\r\nwas a virgin.\r\n\r\nWhat she did for Bassompierre the Queen of Sheba had done for\r\nSolomon;[11] consequently she was right, Holy Writ having created the\r\nprecedent. That which is biblical may well be Anglican. Biblical\r\nprecedent goes so far as to speak of a child who was called Ebnehaquem\r\nor Melilechet--that is to say, the Wise Man’s son.\r\n\r\nWhy object to such manners? Cynicism is at least as good as hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nNowadays England, whose Loyola is named Wesley, casts down her eyes a\r\nlittle at the remembrance of that past age. She is vexed at the memory,\r\nyet proud of it.\r\n\r\nThese fine ladies, moreover, knew Latin. From the 16th century this had\r\nbeen accounted a feminine accomplishment. Lady Jane Grey had carried\r\nfashion to the point of knowing Hebrew. The Duchess Josiana Latinized.\r\nThen (another fine thing) she was secretly a Catholic; after the manner\r\nof her uncle, Charles II., rather than her father, James II. James II.\r\nhad lost his crown for his Catholicism, and Josiana did not care to risk\r\nher peerage. Thus it was that while a Catholic amongst her intimate\r\nfriends and the refined of both sexes, she was outwardly a Protestant\r\nfor the benefit of the riffraff.\r\n\r\nThis is the pleasant view to take of religion. You enjoy all the good\r\nthings belonging to the official Episcopalian church, and later on you\r\ndie, like Grotius, in the odour of Catholicity, having the glory of a\r\nmass being said for you by le Père Petau.\r\n\r\nAlthough plump and healthy, Josiana was, we repeat, a perfect prude.\r\n\r\nAt times her sleepy and voluptuous way of dragging out the end of her\r\nphrases was like the creeping of a tiger’s paws in the jungle.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of prudes is that they disorganize the human race. They\r\ndeprive it of the honour of their adherence. Beyond all, keep the human\r\nspecies at a distance. This is a point of the greatest importance.\r\n\r\nWhen one has not got Olympus, one must take the Hôtel de Rambouillet.\r\nJuno resolves herself into Araminta. A pretension to divinity not\r\nadmitted creates affectation. In default of thunderclaps there is\r\nimpertinence. The temple shrivels into the boudoir. Not having the power\r\nto be a goddess, she is an idol.\r\n\r\nThere is besides, in prudery, a certain pedantry which is pleasing to\r\nwomen. The coquette and the pedant are neighbours. Their kinship is\r\nvisible in the fop. The subtile is derived from the sensual. Gluttony\r\naffects delicacy, a grimace of disgust conceals cupidity. And then woman\r\nfeels her weak point guarded by all that casuistry of gallantry which\r\ntakes the place of scruples in prudes. It is a line of circumvallation\r\nwith a ditch. Every prude puts on an air of repugnance. It is a\r\nprotection. She will consent, but she disdains--for the present.\r\n\r\nJosiana had an uneasy conscience. She felt such a leaning towards\r\nimmodesty that she was a prude. The recoils of pride in the direction\r\nopposed to our vices lead us to those of a contrary nature. It was the\r\nexcessive effort to be chaste which made her a prude. To be too much on\r\nthe defensive points to a secret desire for attack; the shy woman is not\r\nstrait-laced. She shut herself up in the arrogance of the exceptional\r\ncircumstances of her rank, meditating, perhaps, all the while, some\r\nsudden lapse from it.\r\n\r\nIt was the dawn of the eighteenth century. England was a sketch of what\r\nFrance was during the regency. Walpole and Dubois are not unlike.\r\nMarlborough was fighting against his former king, James II., to whom it\r\nwas said he had sold his sister, Miss Churchill. Bolingbroke was in his\r\nmeridian, and Richelieu in his dawn. Gallantry found its convenience in\r\na certain medley of ranks. Men were equalized by the same vices as they\r\nwere later on, perhaps, by the same ideas. Degradation of rank, an\r\naristocratic prelude, began what the revolution was to complete. It was\r\nnot very far off the time when Jelyotte was seen publicly sitting, in\r\nbroad daylight, on the bed of the Marquise d’Epinay. It is true (for\r\nmanners re-echo each other) that in the sixteenth century Smeton’s\r\nnightcap had been found under Anne Boleyn’s pillow.\r\n\r\nIf the word woman signifies fault, as I forget what Council decided,\r\nnever was woman so womanlike as then. Never, covering her frailty by her\r\ncharms, and her weakness by her omnipotence, has she claimed absolution\r\nmore imperiously. In making the forbidden the permitted fruit, Eve fell;\r\nin making the permitted the forbidden fruit, she triumphs. That is the\r\nclimax. In the eighteenth century the wife bolts out her husband. She\r\nshuts herself up in Eden with Satan. Adam is left outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Josiana’s instincts impelled her to yield herself gallantly rather\r\nthan to give herself legally. To surrender on the score of gallantry\r\nimplies learning, recalls Menalcas and Amaryllis, and is almost a\r\nliterary act. Mademoiselle de Scudéry, putting aside the attraction of\r\nugliness for ugliness’ sake, had no other motive for yielding to\r\nPélisson.\r\n\r\nThe maiden a sovereign, the wife a subject, such was the old English\r\nnotion. Josiana was deferring the hour of this subjection as long as she\r\ncould. She must eventually marry Lord David, since such was the royal\r\npleasure. It was a necessity, doubtless; but what a pity! Josiana\r\nappreciated Lord David, and showed him off. There was between them a\r\ntacit agreement neither to conclude nor to break off the engagement.\r\nThey eluded each other. This method of making love, one step in advance\r\nand two back, is expressed in the dances of the period, the minuet and\r\nthe gavotte.\r\n\r\nIt is unbecoming to be married--fades one’s ribbons and makes one look\r\nold. An espousal is a dreary absorption of brilliancy. A woman handed\r\nover to you by a notary, how commonplace! The brutality of marriage\r\ncreates definite situations; suppresses the will; kills choice; has a\r\nsyntax, like grammar; replaces inspiration by orthography; makes a\r\ndictation of love; disperses all life’s mysteries; diminishes the rights\r\nboth of sovereign and subject; by a turn of the scale destroys the\r\ncharming equilibrium of the sexes, the one robust in bodily strength,\r\nthe other all-powerful in feminine weakness--strength on one side,\r\nbeauty on the other; makes one a master and the other a servant, while\r\nwithout marriage one is a slave, the other a queen.\r\n\r\nTo make Love prosaically decent, how gross! to deprive it of all\r\nimpropriety, how dull!\r\n\r\nLord David was ripening. Forty; ’tis a marked period. He did not\r\nperceive this, and in truth he looked no more than thirty. He considered\r\nit more amusing to desire Josiana than to possess her. He possessed\r\nothers. He had mistresses. On the other hand, Josiana had dreams.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess Josiana had a peculiarity, less rare than it is supposed.\r\nOne of her eyes was blue and the other black. Her pupils were made for\r\nlove and hate, for happiness and misery. Night and day were mingled in\r\nher look.\r\n\r\nHer ambition was this--to show herself capable of impossibilities. One\r\nday she said to Swift, “You people fancy that you know what scorn is.”\r\n“You people” meant the human race.\r\n\r\nShe was a skin-deep Papist. Her Catholicism did not exceed the amount\r\nnecessary for fashion. She would have been a Puseyite in the present\r\nday. She wore great dresses of velvet, satin, or moire, some composed of\r\nfifteen or sixteen yards of material, with embroideries of gold and\r\nsilver; and round her waist many knots of pearls, alternating with other\r\nprecious stones. She was extravagant in gold lace. Sometimes she wore an\r\nembroidered cloth jacket like a bachelor. She rode on a man’s saddle,\r\nnotwithstanding the invention of side-saddles, introduced into England\r\nin the fourteenth century by Anne, wife of Richard II. She washed her\r\nface, arms, shoulders, and neck, in sugar-candy, diluted in white of\r\negg, after the fashion of Castile. There came over her face, after any\r\none had spoken wittily in her presence, a reflective smile of singular\r\ngrace. She was free from malice, and rather good-natured than otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE LEADER OF FASHION.\r\n\r\n\r\nJosiana was bored. The fact is so natural as to be scarcely worth\r\nmentioning.\r\n\r\nLord David held the position of judge in the gay life of London. He was\r\nlooked up to by the nobility and gentry. Let us register a glory of Lord\r\nDavid’s. He was daring enough to wear his own hair. The reaction against\r\nthe wig was beginning. Just as in 1824 Eugene Deveria was the first to\r\nallow his beard to grow, so in 1702 Prince Devereux was the first to\r\nrisk wearing his own hair in public disguised by artful curling. For to\r\nrisk one’s hair was almost to risk one’s head. The indignation was\r\nuniversal. Nevertheless Prince Devereux was Viscount Hereford, and a\r\npeer of England. He was insulted, and the deed was well worth the\r\ninsult. In the hottest part of the row Lord David suddenly appeared\r\nwithout his wig and in his own hair. Such conduct shakes the foundations\r\nof society. Lord David was insulted even more than Viscount Hereford. He\r\nheld his ground. Prince Devereux was the first, Lord David Dirry-Moir\r\nthe second. It is sometimes more difficult to be second than first. It\r\nrequires less genius, but more courage. The first, intoxicated by the\r\nnovelty, may ignore the danger; the second sees the abyss, and rushes\r\ninto it. Lord David flung himself into the abyss of no longer wearing a\r\nwig. Later on these lords found imitators. Following these two\r\nrevolutionists, men found sufficient audacity to wear their own hair,\r\nand powder was introduced as an extenuating circumstance.\r\n\r\nIn order to establish, before we pass on, an important period of\r\nhistory, we should remark that the first blow in the war of wigs was\r\nreally struck by a Queen, Christina of Sweden, who wore man’s clothes,\r\nand had appeared in 1680, in her hair of golden brown, powdered, and\r\nbrushed up from her head. She had, besides, says Misson, a slight beard.\r\nThe Pope, on his part, by a bull of March 1694, had somewhat let down\r\nthe wig, by taking it from the heads of bishops and priests, and in\r\nordering churchmen to let their hair grow.\r\n\r\nLord David, then, did not wear a wig, and did wear cowhide boots. Such\r\ngreat things made him a mark for public admiration. There was not a club\r\nof which he was not the leader, not a boxing match in which he was not\r\ndesired as referee. The referee is the arbitrator.\r\n\r\nHe had drawn up the rules of several clubs in high life. He founded\r\nseveral resorts of fashionable society, of which one, the Lady Guinea,\r\nwas still in existence in Pall Mall in 1772. The Lady Guinea was a club\r\nin which all the youth of the peerage congregated. They gamed there. The\r\nlowest stake allowed was a rouleau of fifty guineas, and there was never\r\nless than 20,000 guineas on the table. By the side of each player was a\r\nlittle stand on which to place his cup of tea, and a gilt bowl in which\r\nto put the rouleaux of guineas. The players, like servants when cleaning\r\nknives, wore leather sleeves to save their lace, breastplates of leather\r\nto protect their ruffles, shades on their brows to shelter their eyes\r\nfrom the great glare of the lamps, and, to keep their curls in order,\r\nbroad-brimmed hats covered with flowers. They were masked to conceal\r\ntheir excitement, especially when playing the game of _quinze_. All,\r\nmoreover, had their coats turned the wrong way, for luck. Lord David was\r\na member of the Beefsteak Club, the Surly Club, and of the Splitfarthing\r\nClub, of the Cross Club, the Scratchpenny Club, of the Sealed Knot, a\r\nRoyalist Club, and of the Martinus Scribblerus, founded by Swift, to\r\ntake the place of the Rota, founded by Milton.\r\n\r\nThough handsome, he belonged to the Ugly Club. This club was dedicated\r\nto deformity. The members agreed to fight, not about a beautiful woman,\r\nbut about an ugly man. The hall of the club was adorned by hideous\r\nportraits--Thersites, Triboulet, Duns, Hudibras, Scarron; over the\r\nchimney was Æsop, between two men, each blind of an eye, Cocles and\r\nCamoëns (Cocles being blind of the left, Camoëns of the right eye), so\r\narranged that the two profiles without eyes were turned to each other.\r\nThe day that the beautiful Mrs. Visart caught the small pox the Ugly\r\nClub toasted her. This club was still in existence in the beginning of\r\nthe nineteenth century, and Mirabeau was elected an honorary member.\r\n\r\nSince the restoration of Charles II. revolutionary clubs had been\r\nabolished. The tavern in the little street by Moorfields, where the\r\nCalf’s Head Club was held, had been pulled down; it was so called\r\nbecause on the 30th of January, the day on which the blood of Charles I.\r\nflowed on the scaffold, the members had drunk red wine out of the skull\r\nof a calf to the health of Cromwell. To the republican clubs had\r\nsucceeded monarchical clubs. In them people amused themselves with\r\ndecency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was the Hell-fire Club, where they played at being impious. It was\r\na joust of sacrilege. Hell was at auction there to the highest bidder in\r\nblasphemy.\r\n\r\nThere was the Butting Club, so called from its members butting folks\r\nwith their heads. They found some street porter with a wide chest and a\r\nstupid countenance. They offered him, and compelled him, if necessary,\r\nto accept a pot of porter, in return for which he was to allow them to\r\nbutt him with their heads four times in the chest, and on this they\r\nbetted. One day a man, a great brute of a Welshman named Gogangerdd,\r\nexpired at the third butt. This looked serious. An inquest was held, and\r\nthe jury returned the following verdict: “Died of an inflation of the\r\nheart, caused by excessive drinking.” Gogangerdd had certainly drunk the\r\ncontents of the pot of porter.\r\n\r\nThere was the Fun Club. _Fun_ is like _cant_, like _humour_, a word\r\nwhich is untranslatable. Fun is to farce what pepper is to salt. To get\r\ninto a house and break a valuable mirror, slash the family portraits,\r\npoison the dog, put the cat in the aviary, is called “cutting a bit of\r\nfun.” To give bad news which is untrue, whereby people put on mourning\r\nby mistake, is fun. It was fun to cut a square hole in the Holbein at\r\nHampton Court. Fun would have been proud to have broken the arm of the\r\nVenus of Milo. Under James II. a young millionaire lord who had during\r\nthe night set fire to a thatched cottage--a feat which made all London\r\nburst with laughter--was proclaimed the King of Fun. The poor devils in\r\nthe cottage were saved in their night clothes. The members of the Fun\r\nClub, all of the highest aristocracy, used to run about London during\r\nthe hours when the citizens were asleep, pulling the hinges from the\r\nshutters, cutting off the pipes of pumps, filling up cisterns, digging\r\nup cultivated plots of ground, putting out lamps, sawing through the\r\nbeams which supported houses, breaking the window panes, especially in\r\nthe poor quarters of the town. It was the rich who acted thus towards\r\nthe poor. For this reason no complaint was possible. That was the best\r\nof the joke. Those manners have not altogether disappeared. In many\r\nplaces in England and in English possessions--at Guernsey, for\r\ninstance--your house is now and then somewhat damaged during the night,\r\nor a fence is broken, or the knocker twisted off your door. If it were\r\npoor people who did these things, they would be sent to jail; but they\r\nare done by pleasant young gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThe most fashionable of the clubs was presided over by an emperor, who\r\nwore a crescent on his forehead, and was called the Grand Mohawk. The\r\nMohawk surpassed the Fun. Do evil for evil’s sake was the programme. The\r\nMohawk Club had one great object--to injure. To fulfil this duty all\r\nmeans were held good. In becoming a Mohawk the members took an oath to\r\nbe hurtful. To injure at any price, no matter when, no matter whom, no\r\nmatter where, was a matter of duty. Every member of the Mohawk Club was\r\nbound to possess an accomplishment. One was “a dancing master;” that is\r\nto say he made the rustics frisk about by pricking the calves of their\r\nlegs with the point of his sword. Others knew how to make a man sweat;\r\nthat is to say, a circle of gentlemen with drawn rapiers would surround\r\na poor wretch, so that it was impossible for him not to turn his back\r\nupon some one. The gentleman behind him chastised him for this by a\r\nprick of his sword, which made him spring round; another prick in the\r\nback warned the fellow that one of noble blood was behind him, and so\r\non, each one wounding him in his turn. When the man, closed round by the\r\ncircle of swords and covered with blood, had turned and danced about\r\nenough, they ordered their servants to beat him with sticks, to change\r\nthe course of his ideas. Others “hit the lion”--that is, they gaily\r\nstopped a passenger, broke his nose with a blow of the fist, and then\r\nshoved both thumbs into his eyes. If his eyes were gouged out, he was\r\npaid for them.\r\n\r\nSuch were, towards the beginning of the eighteenth century, the pastimes\r\nof the rich idlers of London. The idlers of Paris had theirs. M. de\r\nCharolais was firing his gun at a citizen standing on his own threshold.\r\nIn all times youth has had its amusements.\r\n\r\nLord David Dirry-Moir brought into all these institutions his\r\nmagnificent and liberal spirit. Just like any one else, he would gaily\r\nset fire to a cot of woodwork and thatch, and just scorch those within;\r\nbut he would rebuild their houses in stone. He insulted two ladies. One\r\nwas unmarried--he gave her a portion; the other was married--he had her\r\nhusband appointed chaplain.\r\n\r\nCockfighting owed him some praiseworthy improvements. It was marvellous\r\nto see Lord David dress a cock for the pit. Cocks lay hold of each other\r\nby the feathers, as men by the hair. Lord David, therefore, made his\r\ncock as bald as possible. With a pair of scissors he cut off all the\r\nfeathers from the tail and from the head to the shoulders, and all those\r\non the neck. So much less for the enemy’s beak, he used to say. Then he\r\nextended the cock’s wings, and cut each feather, one after another, to a\r\npoint, and thus the wings were furnished with darts. So much for the\r\nenemy’s eyes, he would say. Then he scraped its claws with a penknife,\r\nsharpened its nails, fitted it with spurs of sharp steel, spat on its\r\nhead, spat on its neck, anointed it with spittle, as they used to rub\r\noil over athletes; then set it down in the pit, a redoubtable champion,\r\nexclaiming, “That’s how to make a cock an eagle, and a bird of the\r\npoultry yard a bird of the mountain.”\r\n\r\nLord David attended prize-fights, and was their living law. On occasions\r\nof great performances it was he who had the stakes driven in and ropes\r\nstretched, and who fixed the number of feet for the ring. When he was a\r\nsecond, he followed his man step by step, a bottle in one hand, a sponge\r\nin the other, crying out to him to _hit hard_, suggesting stratagems,\r\nadvising him as he fought, wiping away the blood, raising him when\r\noverthrown, placing him on his knee, putting the mouth of the bottle\r\nbetween his teeth, and from his own mouth, filled with water, blowing a\r\nfine rain into his eyes and ears--a thing which reanimates even a dying\r\nman. If he was referee, he saw that there was no foul play, prevented\r\nany one, whosoever he might be, from assisting the combatants, excepting\r\nthe seconds, declare the man beaten who did not fairly face his\r\nopponent, watched that the time between the rounds did not exceed half a\r\nminute, prevented butting, and declared whoever resorted to it beaten,\r\nand forbade a man’s being hit when down. All this science, however, did\r\nnot render him a pedant, nor destroy his ease of manner in society.\r\n\r\nWhen he was referee, rough, pimple-faced, unshorn friends of either\r\ncombatant never dared to come to the aid of their failing man, nor, in\r\norder to upset the chances of the betting, jumped over the barrier,\r\nentered the ring, broke the ropes, pulled down the stakes, and violently\r\ninterposed in the battle. Lord David was one of the few referees whom\r\nthey dared not thrash.\r\n\r\nNo one could train like him. The pugilist whose trainer he consented to\r\nbecome was sure to win. Lord David would choose a Hercules--massive as a\r\nrock, tall as a tower--and make him his child. The problem was to turn\r\nthat human rock from a defensive to an offensive state. In this he\r\nexcelled. Having once adopted the Cyclops, he never left him. He became\r\nhis nurse; he measured out his wine, weighed his meat, and counted his\r\nhours of sleep. It was he who invented the athlete’s admirable rules,\r\nafterwards reproduced by Morley. In the mornings, a raw egg and a glass\r\nof sherry; at twelve, some slices of a leg of mutton, almost raw, with\r\ntea; at four, toast and tea; in the evening, pale ale and toast; after\r\nwhich he undressed his man, rubbed him, and put him to bed. In the\r\nstreet he never allowed him to leave his sight, keeping him out of every\r\ndanger--runaway horses, the wheels of carriages, drunken soldiers,\r\npretty girls. He watched over his virtue. This maternal solicitude\r\ncontinually brought some new perfection into the pupil’s education. He\r\ntaught him the blow with the fist which breaks the teeth, and the twist\r\nof the thumb which gouges out the eye. What could be more touching?\r\n\r\nThus he was preparing himself for public life to which he was to be\r\ncalled later on. It is no easy matter to become an accomplished\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nLord David Dirry-Moir was passionately fond of open-air exhibitions, of\r\nshows, of circuses with wild beasts, of the caravans of mountebanks, of\r\nclowns, tumblers, merrymen, open-air farces, and the wonders of a fair.\r\nThe true noble is he who smacks of the people. Therefore it was that\r\nLord David frequented the taverns and low haunts of London and the\r\nCinque Ports. In order to be able at need, and without compromising his\r\nrank in the white squadron, to be cheek-by-jowl with a topman or a\r\ncalker, he used to wear a sailor’s jacket when he went into the slums.\r\nFor such disguise his not wearing a wig was convenient; for even under\r\nLouis XIV. the people kept to their hair like the lion to his mane.\r\nThis gave him great freedom of action. The low people whom Lord David\r\nused to meet in the stews, and with whom he mixed, held him in high\r\nesteem, without ever dreaming that he was a lord. They called him\r\nTom-Jim-Jack. Under this name he was famous and very popular amongst the\r\ndregs of the people. He played the blackguard in a masterly style: when\r\nnecessary, he used his fists. This phase of his fashionable life was\r\nhighly appreciated by Lady Josiana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nQUEEN ANNE.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbove this couple there was Anne, Queen of England. An ordinary woman\r\nwas Queen Anne. She was gay, kindly, august--to a certain extent. No\r\nquality of hers attained to virtue, none to vice. Her stoutness was\r\nbloated, her fun heavy, her good-nature stupid. She was stubborn and\r\nweak. As a wife she was faithless and faithful, having favourites to\r\nwhom she gave up her heart, and a husband for whom she kept her bed. As\r\na Christian she was a heretic and a bigot. She had one beauty--the\r\nwell-developed neck of a Niobe. The rest of her person was indifferently\r\nformed. She was a clumsy coquette and a chaste one. Her skin was white\r\nand fine; she displayed a great deal of it. It was she who introduced\r\nthe fashion of necklaces of large pearls clasped round the throat. She\r\nhad a narrow forehead, sensual lips, fleshy cheeks, large eyes, short\r\nsight. Her short sight extended to her mind. Beyond a burst of merriment\r\nnow and then, almost as ponderous as her anger, she lived in a sort of\r\ntaciturn grumble and a grumbling silence. Words escaped from her which\r\nhad to be guessed at. She was a mixture of a good woman and a\r\nmischievous devil. She liked surprises, which is extremely woman-like.\r\nAnne was a pattern--just sketched roughly--of the universal Eve. To that\r\nsketch had fallen that chance, the throne. She drank. Her husband was a\r\nDane, thoroughbred. A Tory, she governed by the Whigs--like a woman,\r\nlike a mad woman. She had fits of rage. She was violent, a brawler.\r\nNobody more awkward than Anne in directing affairs of state. She allowed\r\nevents to fall about as they might chance. Her whole policy was\r\ncracked. She excelled in bringing about great catastrophes from little\r\ncauses. When a whim of authority took hold of her, she called it giving\r\na stir with the poker. She would say with an air of profound thought,\r\n“No peer may keep his hat on before the king except De Courcy, Baron\r\nKingsale, an Irish peer;” or, “It would be an injustice were my husband\r\nnot to be Lord High Admiral, since my father was.” And she made George\r\nof Denmark High Admiral of England and of all her Majesty’s plantations.\r\nShe was perpetually perspiring bad humour; she did not explain her\r\nthought, she exuded it. There was something of the Sphinx in this goose.\r\n\r\nShe rather liked fun, teasing, and practical jokes. Could she have made\r\nApollo a hunchback, it would have delighted her. But she would have left\r\nhim a god. Good-natured, her ideal was to allow none to despair, and to\r\nworry all. She had often a rough word in her mouth; a little more, and\r\nshe would have sworn like Elizabeth. From time to time she would take\r\nfrom a man’s pocket, which she wore in her skirt, a little round box, of\r\nchased silver, on which was her portrait, in profile, between the two\r\nletters Q.A.; she would open this box, and take from it, on her finger,\r\na little pomade, with which she reddened her lips, and, having coloured\r\nher mouth, would laugh. She was greedily fond of the flat Zealand\r\ngingerbread cakes. She was proud of being fat.\r\n\r\nMore of a Puritan than anything else, she would, nevertheless, have\r\nliked to devote herself to stage plays. She had an absurd academy of\r\nmusic, copied after that of France. In 1700 a Frenchman, named\r\nForetroche, wanted to build a royal circus at Paris, at a cost of\r\n400,000 francs, which scheme was opposed by D’Argenson. This Forteroche\r\npassed into England, and proposed to Queen Anne, who was immediately\r\ncharmed by the idea, to build in London a theatre with machinery, with a\r\nfourth under-stage finer than that of the King of France. Like Louis\r\nXIV., she liked to be driven at a gallop. Her teams and relays would\r\nsometimes do the distance between London and Windsor in less than an\r\nhour and a quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Anne’s time no meeting was allowed without the permission of two\r\njustices of the peace. The assembly of twelve persons, were it only to\r\neat oysters and drink porter, was a felony. Under her reign, otherwise\r\nrelatively mild, pressing for the fleet was carried on with extreme\r\nviolence--a gloomy evidence that the Englishman is a subject rather than\r\na citizen. For centuries England suffered under that process of tyranny\r\nwhich gave the lie to all the old charters of freedom, and out of which\r\nFrance especially gathered a cause of triumph and indignation. What in\r\nsome degree diminishes the triumph is, that while sailors were pressed\r\nin England, soldiers were pressed in France. In every great town of\r\nFrance, any able-bodied man, going through the streets on his business,\r\nwas liable to be shoved by the crimps into a house called the oven.\r\nThere he was shut up with others in the same plight; those fit for\r\nservice were picked out, and the recruiters sold them to the officers.\r\nIn 1695 there were thirty of these ovens in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe laws against Ireland, emanating from Queen Anne, were atrocious.\r\nAnne was born in 1664, two years before the great fire of London, on\r\nwhich the astrologers (there were some left, and Louis XIV. was born\r\nwith the assistance of an astrologer, and swaddled in a horoscope)\r\npredicted that, being the elder sister of fire, she would be queen. And\r\nso she was, thanks to astrology and the revolution of 1688. She had the\r\nhumiliation of having only Gilbert, Archbishop of Canterbury, for\r\ngodfather. To be godchild of the Pope was no longer possible in England.\r\nA mere primate is but a poor sort of godfather. Anne had to put up with\r\none, however. It was her own fault. Why was she a Protestant?\r\n\r\nDenmark had paid for her virginity (_virginitas empta_, as the old\r\ncharters expressed it) by a dowry of £6,250 a year, secured on the\r\nbailiwick of Wardinburg and the island of Fehmarn. Anne followed,\r\nwithout conviction, and by routine, the traditions of William. The\r\nEnglish under that royalty born of a revolution possessed as much\r\nliberty as they could lay hands on between the Tower of London, into\r\nwhich they put orators, and the pillory, into which they put writers.\r\nAnne spoke a little Danish in her private chats with her husband, and a\r\nlittle French in her private chats with Bolingbroke. Wretched gibberish;\r\nbut the height of English fashion, especially at court, was to talk\r\nFrench. There was never a _bon mot_ but in French. Anne paid a deal of\r\nattention to her coins, especially to copper coins, which are the low\r\nand popular ones; she wanted to cut a great figure on them. Six\r\nfarthings were struck during her reign. On the back of the first three\r\nshe had merely a throne struck, on the back of the fourth she ordered a\r\ntriumphal chariot, and on the back of the sixth a goddess holding a\r\nsword in one hand and an olive branch in the other, with the scroll,\r\n_Bello et pace_. Her father, James II., was candid and cruel; she was\r\nbrutal.\r\n\r\nAt the same time she was mild at bottom. A contradiction which only\r\nappears such. A fit of anger metamorphosed her. Heat sugar and it will\r\nboil.\r\n\r\nAnne was popular. England liked feminine rulers. Why? France excludes\r\nthem. There is a reason at once. Perhaps there is no other. With English\r\nhistorians Elizabeth embodies grandeur, Anne good-nature. As they will.\r\nBe it so. But there is nothing delicate in the reigns of these women.\r\nThe lines are heavy. It is gross grandeur and gross good-nature. As to\r\ntheir immaculate virtue, England is tenacious of it, and we are not\r\ngoing to oppose the idea. Elizabeth was a virgin tempered by Essex;\r\nAnne, a wife complicated by Bolingbroke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne idiotic habit of the people is to attribute to the king what they do\r\nthemselves. They fight. Whose the glory? The king’s. They pay. Whose the\r\ngenerosity? The king’s. Then the people love him for being so rich. The\r\nking receives a crown from the poor, and returns them a farthing. How\r\ngenerous he is! The colossus which is the pedestal contemplates the\r\npigmy which is the statue. How great is this myrmidon! he is on my back.\r\nA dwarf has an excellent way of being taller than a giant: it is to\r\nperch himself on his shoulders. But that the giant should allow it,\r\nthere is the wonder; and that he should admire the height of the dwarf,\r\nthere is the folly. Simplicity of mankind! The equestrian statue,\r\nreserved for kings alone, is an excellent figure of royalty: the horse\r\nis the people. Only that the horse becomes transfigured by degrees. It\r\nbegins in an ass; it ends in a lion. Then it throws its rider, and you\r\nhave 1642 in England and 1789 in France; and sometimes it devours him,\r\nand you have in England 1649, and in France 1793. That the lion should\r\nrelapse into the donkey is astonishing; but it is so. This was\r\noccurring in England. It had resumed the pack-saddle, idolatry of the\r\ncrown. Queen Anne, as we have just observed, was popular. What was she\r\ndoing to be so? Nothing. Nothing!--that is all that is asked of the\r\nsovereign of England. He receives for that nothing £1,250,000 a year. In\r\n1705, England which had had but thirteen men of war under Elizabeth, and\r\nthirty-six under James I., counted a hundred and fifty in her fleet. The\r\nEnglish had three armies, 5,000 men in Catalonia; 10,000 in Portugal;\r\n50,000 in Flanders; and besides, was paying £1,666,666 a year to\r\nmonarchical and diplomatic Europe, a sort of prostitute the English\r\npeople has always had in keeping. Parliament having voted a patriotic\r\nloan of thirty-four million francs of annuities, there had been a crush\r\nat the Exchequer to subscribe it. England was sending a squadron to the\r\nEast Indies, and a squadron to the West of Spain under Admiral Leake,\r\nwithout mentioning the reserve of four hundred sail, under Admiral Sir\r\nCloudesley Shovel. England had lately annexed Scotland. It was the\r\ninterval between Hochstadt and Ramillies, and the first of these\r\nvictories was foretelling the second. England, in its cast of the net at\r\nHochstadt, had made prisoners of twenty-seven battalions and four\r\nregiments of dragoons, and deprived France of one hundred leagues of\r\ncountry--France drawing back dismayed from the Danube to the Rhine.\r\nEngland was stretching her hand out towards Sardinia and the Balearic\r\nIslands. She was bringing into her ports in triumph ten Spanish\r\nline-of-battle ships, and many a galleon laden with gold. Hudson Bay and\r\nStraits were already half given over by Louis XIV. It was felt that he\r\nwas about to give up his hold over Acadia, St. Christopher, and\r\nNewfoundland, and that he would be but too happy if England would only\r\ntolerate the King of France fishing for cod at Cape Breton. England was\r\nabout to impose upon him the shame of demolishing himself the\r\nfortifications of Dunkirk. Meanwhile, she had taken Gibraltar, and was\r\ntaking Barcelona. What great things accomplished! How was it possible to\r\nrefuse Anne admiration for taking the trouble of living at the period?\r\n\r\nFrom a certain point of view, the reign of Anne appears a reflection of\r\nthe reign of Louis XIV. Anne, for a moment even with that king in the\r\nrace which is called history, bears to him the vague resemblance of a\r\nreflection. Like him, she plays at a great reign; she has her\r\nmonuments, her arts, her victories, her captains, her men of letters,\r\nher privy purse to pension celebrities, her gallery of chefs-d’oeuvre,\r\nside by side with those of his Majesty. Her court, too, was a cortège,\r\nwith the features of a triumph, an order and a march. It was a miniature\r\ncopy of all the great men of Versailles, not giants themselves. In it\r\nthere is enough to deceive the eye; add God save the Queen, which might\r\nhave been taken from Lulli, and the ensemble becomes an illusion. Not a\r\npersonage is missing. Christopher Wren is a very passable Mansard;\r\nSomers is as good as Lamoignon; Anne has a Racine in Dryden, a Boileau\r\nin Pope, a Colbert in Godolphin, a Louvois in Pembroke, and a Turenne in\r\nMarlborough. Heighten the wigs and lower the foreheads. The whole is\r\nsolemn and pompous, and the Windsor of the time has a faded resemblance\r\nto Marly. Still the whole was effeminate, and Anne’s Père Tellier was\r\ncalled Sarah Jennings. However, there is an outline of incipient irony,\r\nwhich fifty years later was to turn to philosophy, in the literature of\r\nthe age, and the Protestant Tartuffe is unmasked by Swift just in the\r\nsame way as the Catholic Tartuffe is denounced by Molière. Although the\r\nEngland of the period quarrels and fights France, she imitates her and\r\ndraws enlightenment from her; and the light on the façade of England is\r\nFrench light. It is a pity that Anne’s reign lasted but twelve years, or\r\nthe English would not hesitate to call it the century of Anne, as we say\r\nthe century of Louis XIV. Anne appeared in 1702, as Louis XIV. declined.\r\nIt is one of the curiosities of history, that the rise of that pale\r\nplanet coincides with the setting of the planet of purple, and that at\r\nthe moment in which France had the king Sun, England should have had the\r\nqueen Moon.\r\n\r\nA detail to be noted. Louis XIV., although they made war with him, was\r\ngreatly admired in England. “He is the kind of king they want in\r\nFrance,” said the English. The love of the English for their own liberty\r\nis mingled with a certain acceptance of servitude for others. That\r\nfavourable regard of the chains which bind their neighbours sometimes\r\nattains to enthusiasm for the despot next door.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, Anne rendered her people _hureux_, as the French translator\r\nof Beeverell’s book repeats three times, with graceful reiteration at\r\nthe sixth and ninth page of his dedication and the third of his preface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nQueen Anne bore a little grudge to the Duchess Josiana, for two reasons.\r\nFirstly, because she thought the Duchess Josiana handsome. Secondly,\r\nbecause she thought the Duchess Josiana’s betrothed handsome. Two\r\nreasons for jealousy are sufficient for a woman. One is sufficient for a\r\nqueen. Let us add that she bore her a grudge for being her sister. Anne\r\ndid not like women to be pretty. She considered it against good morals.\r\nAs for herself, she was ugly. Not from choice, however. A part of her\r\nreligion she derived from that ugliness. Josiana, beautiful and\r\nphilosophical, was a cause of vexation to the queen. To an ugly queen, a\r\npretty duchess is not an agreeable sister.\r\n\r\nThere was another grievance, Josiana’s “improper” birth. Anne was the\r\ndaughter of Anne Hyde, a simple gentlewoman, legitimately, but\r\nvexatiously, married by James II. when Duke of York. Anne, having this\r\ninferior blood in her veins, felt herself but half royal, and Josiana,\r\nhaving come into the world quite irregularly, drew closer attention to\r\nthe incorrectness, less great, but really existing, in the birth of the\r\nqueen. The daughter of _mésalliance_ looked without love upon the\r\ndaughter of bastardy, so near her. It was an unpleasant resemblance.\r\nJosiana had a right to say to Anne, “My mother was at least as good as\r\nyours.” At court no one said so, but they evidently thought it. This was\r\na bore for her royal Majesty. Why this Josiana? What had put it into her\r\nhead to be born? What good was a Josiana? Certain relationships are\r\ndetrimental. Nevertheless, Anne smiled on Josiana. Perhaps she might\r\neven have liked her, had she not been her sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nBARKILPHEDRO.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is useful to know what people do, and a certain surveillance is wise.\r\nJosiana had Lord David watched by a little creature of hers, in whom she\r\nreposed confidence, and whose name was Barkilphedro.\r\n\r\nLord David had Josiana discreetly observed by a creature of his, of whom\r\nhe was sure, and whose name was Barkilphedro.\r\n\r\nQueen Anne, on her part, kept herself secretly informed of the actions\r\nand conduct of the Duchess Josiana, her bastard sister, and of Lord\r\nDavid, her future brother-in-law by the left hand, by a creature of\r\nhers, on whom she counted fully, and whose name was Barkilphedro.\r\n\r\nThis Barkilphedro had his fingers on that keyboard--Josiana, Lord David,\r\na queen. A man between two women. What modulations possible! What\r\namalgamation of souls!\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro had not always held the magnificent position of whispering\r\ninto three ears.\r\n\r\nHe was an old servant of the Duke of York. He had tried to be a\r\nchurchman but had failed. The Duke of York, an English and a Roman\r\nprince, compounded of royal Popery and legal Anglicanism, had his\r\nCatholic house and his Protestant house, and might have pushed\r\nBarkilphedro in one or the other hierarchy; but he did not judge him to\r\nbe Catholic enough to make him almoner, or Protestant enough to make him\r\nchaplain. So that between two religions, Barkilphedro found himself with\r\nhis soul on the ground.\r\n\r\nNot a bad posture, either, for certain reptile souls.\r\n\r\nCertain ways are impracticable, except by crawling flat on the belly.\r\n\r\nAn obscure but fattening servitude had long made up Barkilphedro’s whole\r\nexistence. Service is something; but he wanted power besides. He was,\r\nperhaps, about to reach it when James II. fell. He had to begin all over\r\nagain. Nothing to do under William III., a sullen prince, and exercising\r\nin his mode of reigning a prudery which he believed to be probity.\r\nBarkilphedro, when his protector, James II., was dethroned, did not\r\nlapse all at once into rags. There is a something which survives deposed\r\nprinces, and which feeds and sustains their parasites. The remains of\r\nthe exhaustible sap causes leaves to live on for two or three days on\r\nthe branches of the uprooted tree; then, all at once, the leaf yellows\r\nand dries up: and thus it is with the courtier.\r\n\r\nThanks to that embalming which is called legitimacy, the prince himself,\r\nalthough fallen and cast away, lasts and keeps preserved; it is not so\r\nwith the courtier, much more dead than the king. The king, beyond there,\r\nis a mummy; the courtier, here, is a phantom. To be the shadow of a\r\nshadow is leanness indeed. Hence Barkilphedro became famished. Then he\r\ntook up the character of a man of letters.\r\n\r\nBut he was thrust back even from the kitchens. Sometimes he knew not\r\nwhere to sleep. “Who will give me shelter?” he would ask. He struggled\r\non. All that is interesting in patience in distress he possessed. He\r\nhad, besides, the talent of the termite--knowing how to bore a hole from\r\nthe bottom to the top. By dint of making use of the name of James II.,\r\nof old memories, of fables of fidelity, of touching stories, he pierced\r\nas far as the Duchess Josiana’s heart.\r\n\r\nJosiana took a liking to this man of poverty and wit, an interesting\r\ncombination. She presented him to Lord Dirry-Moir, gave him a shelter in\r\nthe servants’ hall among her domestics, retained him in her household,\r\nwas kind to him, and sometimes even spoke to him. Barkilphedro felt\r\nneither hunger nor cold again. Josiana addressed him in the second\r\nperson; it was the fashion for great ladies to do so to men of letters,\r\nwho allowed it. The Marquise de Mailly received Roy, whom she had never\r\nseen before, in bed, and said to him, “C’est toi qui as fait l’Année\r\ngalante! Bonjour.” Later on, the men of letters returned the custom. The\r\nday came when Fabre d’Eglantine said to the Duchesse de Rohan, “N’est-tu\r\npas la Chabot?”\r\n\r\nFor Barkilphedro to be “thee’d” and “thou’d” was a success; he was\r\noverjoyed by it. He had aspired to this contemptuous familiarity. “Lady\r\nJosiana thees-and-thous me,” he would say to himself. And he would rub\r\nhis hands. He profited by this theeing-and-thouing to make further way.\r\nHe became a sort of constant attendant in Josiana’s private rooms; in no\r\nway troublesome; unperceived; the duchess would almost have changed her\r\nshift before him. All this, however, was precarious. Barkilphedro was\r\naiming at a position. A duchess was half-way; an underground passage\r\nwhich did not lead to the queen was having bored for nothing.\r\n\r\nOne day Barkilphedro said to Josiana,--\r\n\r\n“Would your Grace like to make my fortune?”.\r\n\r\n“What dost thou want?”\r\n\r\n“An appointment.”\r\n\r\n“An appointment? for thee!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, madam.”\r\n\r\n“What an idea! _thou_ to ask for an appointment! thou, who art good for\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\n“That’s just the reason.”\r\n\r\nJosiana burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n“Among the offices to which thou art unsuited, which dost thou desire?”\r\n\r\n“That of cork drawer of the bottles of the ocean.”\r\n\r\nJosiana’s laugh redoubled.\r\n\r\n“What meanest thou? Thou art fooling.”\r\n\r\n“No, madam.”\r\n\r\n“To amuse myself, I shall answer you seriously,” said the duchess. “What\r\ndost thou wish to be? Repeat it.”\r\n\r\n“Uncorker of the bottles of the ocean.”\r\n\r\n“Everything is possible at court. Is there an appointment of that kind?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, madam.”\r\n\r\n“This is news to me. Go on.”\r\n\r\n“There is such an appointment.”\r\n\r\n“Swear it on the soul which thou dost not possess.”\r\n\r\n“I swear it.”\r\n\r\n“I do not believe thee.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, madam.”\r\n\r\n“Then thou wishest? Begin again.”\r\n\r\n“To uncork the bottles of the ocean.”\r\n\r\n“That is a situation which can give little trouble. It is like grooming\r\na bronze horse.”\r\n\r\n“Very nearly.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing to do. Well ’tis a situation to suit thee. Thou art good for\r\nthat much.”\r\n\r\n“You see I am good for something.”\r\n\r\n“Come! thou art talking nonsense. Is there such an appointment?”\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro assumed an attitude of deferential gravity. “Madam, you had\r\nan august father, James II., the king, and you have an illustrious\r\nbrother-in-law, George of Denmark, Duke of Cumberland; your father was,\r\nand your brother is, Lord High Admiral of England--”\r\n\r\n“Is what thou tellest me fresh news? I know all that as well as thou.”\r\n\r\n“But here is what your Grace does not know. In the sea there are three\r\nkinds of things: those at the bottom, _lagan_; those which float,\r\n_flotsam_; those which the sea throws up on the shore, _jetsam_.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“These three things--_lagan_, _flotsam_, and _jetsam_--belong to the\r\nLord High Admiral.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“Your Grace understands.”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“All that is in the sea, all that sinks, all that floats, all that is\r\ncast ashore--all belongs to the Admiral of England.”\r\n\r\n“Everything! Really? And then?”\r\n\r\n“Except the sturgeon, which belongs to the king.”\r\n\r\n“I should have thought,” said Josiana, “all that would have belonged to\r\nNeptune.”\r\n\r\n“Neptune is a fool. He has given up everything. He has allowed the\r\nEnglish to take everything.”\r\n\r\n“Finish what thou wert saying.”\r\n\r\n“‘Prizes of the sea’ is the name given to such _treasure trove_.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so.”\r\n\r\n“It is boundless: there is always something floating, something being\r\ncast up. It is the contribution of the sea--the tax which the ocean pays\r\nto England.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart. But pray conclude.”\r\n\r\n“Your Grace understands that in this way the ocean creates a\r\ndepartment.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“At the Admiralty.”\r\n\r\n“What department?”\r\n\r\n“The Sea Prize Department.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“The department is subdivided into three offices--Lagan, Flotsam, and\r\nJetsam--and in each there is an officer.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“A ship at sea writes to give notice on any subject to those on\r\nland--that it is sailing in such a latitude; that it has met a sea\r\nmonster; that it is in sight of shore; that it is in distress; that it\r\nis about to founder; that it is lost, etc. The captain takes a bottle,\r\nputs into it a bit of paper on which he has written the information,\r\ncorks up the flask, and casts it into the sea. If the bottle goes to the\r\nbottom, it is in the department of the lagan officer; if it floats, it\r\nis in the department of the flotsam officer; if it be thrown upon shore,\r\nit concerns the jetsam officer.”\r\n\r\n“And wouldst thou like to be the jetsam officer?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely so.”\r\n\r\n“And that is what thou callest uncorking the bottles of the ocean?”\r\n\r\n“Since there is such an appointment.”\r\n\r\n“Why dost thou wish for the last-named place in preference to both the\r\nothers?”\r\n\r\n“Because it is vacant just now.”\r\n\r\n“In what does the appointment consist?”\r\n\r\n“Madam, in 1598 a tarred bottle, picked up by a man, conger-fishing on\r\nthe strand of Epidium Promontorium, was brought to Queen Elizabeth; and\r\na parchment drawn out of it gave information to England that Holland had\r\ntaken, without saying anything about it, an unknown country, Nova\r\nZembla; that the capture had taken place in June, 1596; that in that\r\ncountry people were eaten by bears; and that the manner of passing the\r\nwinter was described on a paper enclosed in a musket-case hanging in the\r\nchimney of the wooden house built in the island, and left by the\r\nDutchmen, who were all dead: and that the chimney was built of a barrel\r\nwith the end knocked out, sunk into the roof.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand much of thy rigmarole.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so. Elizabeth understood. A country the more for Holland was a\r\ncountry the less for England. The bottle which had given the information\r\nwas held to be of importance; and thenceforward an order was issued that\r\nanybody who should find a sealed bottle on the sea-shore should take it\r\nto the Lord High Admiral of England, under pain of the gallows. The\r\nadmiral entrusts the opening of such bottles to an officer, who presents\r\nthe contents to the queen, if there be reason for so doing.”\r\n\r\n“Are many such bottles brought to the Admiralty?”\r\n\r\n“But few. But it’s all the same. The appointment exists. There is for\r\nthe office a room and lodgings at the Admiralty.”\r\n\r\n“And for that way of doing nothing, how is one paid?”\r\n\r\n“One hundred guineas a year.”\r\n\r\n“And thou wouldst trouble me for that much?”\r\n\r\n“It is enough to live upon.”\r\n\r\n“Like a beggar.”\r\n\r\n“As it becomes one of my sort.”\r\n\r\n“One hundred guineas! It’s a bagatelle.”\r\n\r\n“What keeps you for a minute, keeps us for a year. That’s the advantage\r\nof the poor.”\r\n\r\n“Thou shalt have the place.”\r\n\r\nA week afterwards, thanks to Josiana’s exertions, thanks to the\r\ninfluence of Lord David Dirry-Moir, Barkilphedro--safe thenceforward,\r\ndrawn out of his precarious existence, lodged, and boarded, with a\r\nsalary of a hundred guineas--was installed at the Admiralty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nBARKILPHEDRO GNAWS HIS WAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one thing the most pressing of all: to be ungrateful.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro was not wanting therein.\r\n\r\nHaving received so many benefits from Josiana, he had naturally but one\r\nthought--to revenge himself on her. When we add that Josiana was\r\nbeautiful, great, young, rich, powerful, illustrious, while Barkilphedro\r\nwas ugly, little, old, poor, dependent, obscure, he must necessarily\r\nrevenge himself for all this as well.\r\n\r\nWhen a man is made out of night, how is he to forgive so many beams of\r\nlight?\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro was an Irishman who had denied Ireland--a bad species.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro had but one thing in his favour--that he had a very big\r\nbelly. A big belly passes for a sign of kind-heartedness. But his belly\r\nwas but an addition to Barkilphedro’s hypocrisy; for the man was full of\r\nmalice.\r\n\r\nWhat was Barkilphedro’s age? None. The age necessary for his project of\r\nthe moment. He was old in his wrinkles and gray hairs, young in the\r\nactivity of his mind. He was active and ponderous; a sort of\r\nhippopotamus-monkey. A royalist, certainly; a republican--who knows? a\r\nCatholic, perhaps; a Protestant, without doubt. For Stuart, probably;\r\nfor Brunswick, evidently. To be For is a power only on the condition of\r\nbeing at the same time Against. Barkilphedro practised this wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of drawer of the bottles of the ocean was not as absurd\r\nas Barkilphedro had appeared to make out. The complaints, which would in\r\nthese times be termed declamations, of Garcia Fernandez in his\r\n“Chart-Book of the Sea,” against the robbery of jetsam, called right of\r\nwreck, and against the pillage of wreck by the inhabitants of the coast,\r\nhad created a sensation in England, and had obtained for the shipwrecked\r\nthis reform--that their goods, chattels, and property, instead of being\r\nstolen by the country-people, were confiscated by the Lord High Admiral.\r\nAll the _débris_ of the sea cast upon the English shore--merchandise,\r\nbroken hulls of ships, bales, chests, etc.--belonged to the Lord High\r\nAdmiral; but--and here was revealed the importance of the place asked\r\nfor by Barkilphedro--the floating receptacles containing messages and\r\ndeclarations awakened particularly the attention of the Admiralty.\r\nShipwrecks are one of England’s gravest cares. Navigation being her\r\nlife, shipwreck is her anxiety. England is kept in perpetual care by the\r\nsea. The little glass bottle thrown to the waves by the doomed ship,\r\ncontains final intelligence, precious from every point of view.\r\nIntelligence concerning the ship, intelligence concerning the crew,\r\nintelligence concerning the place, the time, the manner of loss,\r\nintelligence concerning the winds which have broken up the vessel,\r\nintelligence concerning the currents which bore the floating flask\r\nashore. The situation filled by Barkilphedro has been abolished more\r\nthan a century, but it had its real utility. The last holder was William\r\nHussey, of Doddington, in Lincolnshire. The man who held it was a sort\r\nof guardian of the things of the sea. All the closed and sealed-up\r\nvessels, bottles, flasks, jars, thrown upon the English coast by the\r\ntide were brought to him. He alone had the right to open them; he was\r\nfirst in the secrets of their contents; he put them in order, and\r\nticketed them with his signature. The expression “_loger un papier au\r\ngreffe_,” still used in the Channel Islands, is thence derived. However,\r\none precaution was certainly taken. Not one of these bottles could be\r\nunsealed except in the presence of two jurors of the Admiralty sworn to\r\nsecrecy, who signed, conjointly with the holder of the jetsam office,\r\nthe official report of the opening. But these jurors being held to\r\nsecrecy, there resulted for Barkilphedro a certain discretionary\r\nlatitude; it depended upon him, to a certain extent, to suppress a fact\r\nor bring it to light.\r\n\r\nThese fragile floating messages were far from being what Barkilphedro\r\nhad told Josiana, rare and insignificant. Some times they reached land\r\nwith little delay; at others, after many years. That depended on the\r\nwinds and the currents. The fashion of casting bottles on the surface of\r\nthe sea has somewhat passed away, like that of vowing offerings, but in\r\nthose religious times, those who were about to die were glad thus to\r\nsend their last thought to God and to men, and at times these messages\r\nfrom the sea were plentiful at the Admiralty. A parchment preserved in\r\nthe hall at Audlyene (ancient spelling), with notes by the Earl of\r\nSuffolk, Grand Treasurer of England under James I., bears witness that\r\nin the one year, 1615, fifty-two flasks, bladders, and tarred vessels,\r\ncontaining mention of sinking ships, were brought and registered in the\r\nrecords of the Lord High Admiral.\r\n\r\nCourt appointments are the drop of oil in the widow’s cruse, they ever\r\nincrease. Thus it is that the porter has become chancellor, and the\r\ngroom, constable. The special officer charged with the appointment\r\ndesired and obtained by Barkilphedro was invariably a confidential man.\r\nElizabeth had wished that it should be so. At court, to speak of\r\nconfidence is to speak of intrigue, and to speak of intrigue is to speak\r\nof advancement. This functionary had come to be a personage of some\r\nconsideration. He was a clerk, and ranked directly after the two grooms\r\nof the almonry. He had the right of entrance into the palace, but we\r\nmust add, what was called the humble entrance--_humilis introïtus_--and\r\neven into the bed-chamber. For it was the custom that he should inform\r\nthe monarch, on occasions of sufficient importance, of the objects\r\nfound, which were often very curious: the wills of men in despair,\r\nfarewells cast to fatherland, revelations of falsified logs, bills of\r\nlading, and crimes committed at sea, legacies to the crown, etc., that\r\nhe should maintain his records in communication with the court, and\r\nshould account, from time to time, to the king or queen, concerning the\r\nopening of these ill-omened bottles. It was the black cabinet of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, who was always glad of an opportunity of speaking Latin, used\r\nto ask Tonfield, of Coley in Berkshire, jetsam officer of her day, when\r\nhe brought her one of these papers cast up by the sea, “Quid mihi\r\nscribit Neptunus?” (What does Neptune write me?)\r\n\r\nThe way had been eaten, the insect had succeeded. Barkilphedro\r\napproached the queen.\r\n\r\nThis was all he wanted.\r\n\r\nTo make his fortune?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nTo unmake that of others?\r\n\r\nA greater happiness.\r\n\r\nTo hurt is to enjoy.\r\n\r\nTo have within one the desire of injuring, vague but implacable, and\r\nnever to lose sight of it, is not given to all.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro possessed that fixity of intention.\r\n\r\nAs the bulldog holds on with his jaws, so did his thought.\r\n\r\nTo feel himself inexorable gave him a depth of gloomy satisfaction. As\r\nlong as he had a prey under his teeth, or in his soul, a certainty of\r\nevil-doing, he wanted nothing.\r\n\r\nHe was happy, shivering in the cold which his neighbour was suffering.\r\nTo be malignant is an opulence. Such a man is believed to be poor, and,\r\nin truth, is so; but he has all his riches in malice, and prefers having\r\nthem so. Everything is in what contents one. To do a bad turn, which is\r\nthe same as a good turn, is better than money. Bad for him who endures,\r\ngood for him who does it. Catesby, the colleague of Guy Fawkes, in the\r\nPopish powder plot, said: “To see Parliament blown upside down, I\r\nwouldn’t miss it for a million sterling.”\r\n\r\nWhat was Barkilphedro? That meanest and most terrible of things--an\r\nenvious man.\r\n\r\nEnvy is a thing ever easily placed at court.\r\n\r\nCourts abound in impertinent people, in idlers, in rich loungers\r\nhungering for gossip, in those who seek for needles in trusses of hay,\r\nin triflers, in banterers bantered, in witty ninnies, who cannot do\r\nwithout converse with an envious man.\r\n\r\nWhat a refreshing thing is the evil spoken to you of others.\r\n\r\nEnvy is good stuff to make a spy. There is a profound analogy between\r\nthat natural passion, envy, and that social function, espionage. The spy\r\nhunts on others’ account, like the dog. The envious man hunts on his\r\nown, like the cat.\r\n\r\nA fierce Myself, such is the envious man.\r\n\r\nHe had other qualities. Barkilphedro was discreet, secret, concrete. He\r\nkept in everything and racked himself with his hate. Enormous baseness\r\nimplies enormous vanity. He was liked by those whom he amused, and hated\r\nby all others; but he felt that he was disdained by those who hated\r\nhim, and despised by those who liked him. He restrained himself. All\r\nhis gall simmered noiselessly in his hostile resignation. He was\r\nindignant, as if rogues had the right to be so. He was the furies’\r\nsilent prey. To swallow everything was his talent. There were deaf\r\nwraths within him, frenzies of interior rage, black and brooding flames\r\nunseen; he was a _smoke-consuming_ man of passion. The surface was\r\nsmiling. He was kind, prompt, easy, amiable, obliging. Never mind to\r\nwhom, never mind where, he bowed. For a breath of wind he inclined to\r\nthe earth. What a source of fortune to have a reed for a spine! Such\r\nconcealed and venomous beings are not so rare as is believed. We live\r\nsurrounded by ill-omened crawling things. Wherefore the malevolent? A\r\nkeen question! The dreamer constantly proposes it to himself, and the\r\nthinker never resolves it. Hence the sad eye of the philosophers ever\r\nfixed upon that mountain of darkness which is destiny, and from the top\r\nof which the colossal spectre of evil casts handfuls of serpents over\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro’s body was obese and his face lean. A fat bust and a bony\r\ncountenance. His nails were channelled and short, his fingers knotted,\r\nhis thumbs flat, his hair coarse, his temples wide apart, and his\r\nforehead a murderer’s, broad and low. The littleness of his eye was\r\nhidden under his bushy eyebrows. His nose, long, sharp, and flabby,\r\nnearly met his mouth. Barkilphedro, properly attired, as an emperor,\r\nwould have somewhat resembled Domitian. His face of muddy yellow might\r\nhave been modelled in slimy paste--his immovable cheeks were like putty;\r\nhe had all kinds of ugly refractory wrinkles; the angle of his jaw was\r\nmassive, his chin heavy, his ear underbred. In repose, and seen in\r\nprofile, his upper lip was raised at an acute angle, showing two teeth.\r\nThose teeth seemed to look at you. The teeth can look, just as the eye\r\ncan bite.\r\n\r\nPatience, temperance, continence, reserve, self-control, amenity,\r\ndeference, gentleness, politeness, sobriety, chastity, completed and\r\nfinished Barkilphedro. He culumniated those virtues by their possession.\r\n\r\nIn a short time Barkilphedro took a foothold at court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nINFERI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of making a footing at court. In the clouds, and you\r\nare august; in the mud, and you are powerful.\r\n\r\nIn the first case, you belong to Olympus.\r\n\r\nIn the second case, you belong to the private closet.\r\n\r\nHe who belongs to Olympus has but the thunderbolt, he who is of the\r\nprivate closet has the police.\r\n\r\nThe private closet contains all the instruments of government, and\r\nsometimes, for it is a traitor, its chastisement. Heliogabalus goes\r\nthere to die. Then it is called the latrines.\r\n\r\nGenerally it is less tragic. It is there that Alberoni admires Vendôme.\r\nRoyal personages willingly make it their place of audience. It takes the\r\nplace of the throne. Louis XIV. receives the Duchess of Burgundy there.\r\nPhilip V. is shoulder to shoulder there with the queen. The priest\r\npenetrates into it. The private closet is sometimes a branch of the\r\nconfessional. Therefore it is that at court there are underground\r\nfortunes--not always the least. If, under Louis XI., you would be great,\r\nbe Pierre de Rohan, Marshal of France; if you would be influential, be\r\nOlivier le Daim, the barber; if you would, under Mary de Medicis, be\r\nglorious, be Sillery, the Chancellor; if you would be a person of\r\nconsideration, be La Hannon, the maid; if you would, under Louis XV., be\r\nillustrious, be Choiseul, the minister; if you would be formidable, be\r\nLebel, the valet. Given, Louis XIV., Bontemps, who makes his bed, is\r\nmore powerful than Louvois, who raises his armies, and Turenne, who\r\ngains his victories. From Richelieu, take Père Joseph, and you have\r\nRichelieu nearly empty. There is the mystery the less. His Eminence in\r\nscarlet is magnificent; his Eminence in gray is terrible. What power in\r\nbeing a worm! All the Narvaez amalgamated with all the O’Donnells do\r\nless work than one Sõr Patrocinio.\r\n\r\nOf course the condition of this power is littleness. If you would remain\r\npowerful, remain petty. Be Nothingness. The serpent in repose, twisted\r\ninto a circle, is a figure at the same time of the infinite and of\r\nnaught.\r\n\r\nOne of these viper-like fortunes had fallen to Barkilphedro.\r\n\r\nHe had crawled where he wanted.\r\n\r\nFlat beasts can get in everywhere. Louis XIV. had bugs in his bed and\r\nJesuits in his policy.\r\n\r\nThe incompatibility is nil.\r\n\r\nIn this world everything is a clock. To gravitate is to oscillate. One\r\npole is attracted to the other. Francis I. is attracted by Triboulet;\r\nLouis XIV. is attracted by Lebel. There exists a deep affinity between\r\nextreme elevation and extreme debasement.\r\n\r\nIt is abasement which directs. Nothing is easier of comprehension. It is\r\nhe who is below who pulls the strings. No position more convenient. He\r\nis the eye, and has the ear. He is the eye of the government; he has the\r\near of the king. To have the eye of the king is to draw and shut, at\r\none’s whim, the bolt of the royal conscience, and to throw into that\r\nconscience whatever one wishes. The mind of the king is his cupboard; if\r\nhe be a rag-picker, it is his basket. The ears of kings belong not to\r\nkings, and therefore it is that, on the whole, the poor devils are not\r\naltogether responsible for their actions. He who does not possess his\r\nown thought does not possess his own deed. A king obeys--what? Any evil\r\nspirit buzzing from outside in his ear; a noisome fly of the abyss.\r\n\r\nThis buzzing commands. A reign is a dictation.\r\n\r\nThe loud voice is the sovereign; the low voice, sovereignty. Those who\r\nknow how to distinguish, in a reign, this low voice, and to hear what it\r\nwhispers to the loud, are the real historians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nHATE IS AS STRONG AS LOVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nQueen Anne had several of these low voices about her. Barkilphedro was\r\none.\r\n\r\nBesides the queen, he secretly worked, influenced, and plotted upon Lady\r\nJosiana and Lord David. As we have said, he whispered in three ears, one\r\nmore than Dangeau. Dangeau whispered in but two, in the days when,\r\nthrusting himself between Louis XIV., in love with Henrietta, his\r\nsister-in-law, and Henrietta, in love with Louis XIV., her\r\nbrother-in-law, he being Louis’s secretary, without the knowledge of\r\nHenrietta, and Henrietta’s without the knowledge of Louis, he wrote the\r\nquestions and answers of both the love-making marionettes.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro was so cheerful, so accepting, so incapable of taking up\r\nthe defence of anybody, possessing so little devotion at bottom, so\r\nugly, so mischievous, that it was quite natural that a regal personage\r\nshould come to be unable to do without him. Once Anne had tasted\r\nBarkilphedro she would have no other flatterer. He flattered her as they\r\nflattered Louis the Great, by stinging her neighbours. “The king being\r\nignorant,” says Madame de Montchevreuil, “one is obliged to mock at the\r\nsavants.”\r\n\r\nTo poison the sting, from time to time, is the acme of art. Nero loves\r\nto see Locusta at work.\r\n\r\nRoyal palaces are very easily entered; these madrepores have a way in\r\nsoon guessed at, contrived, examined, and scooped out at need by the\r\ngnawing thing which is called the courtier. A pretext to enter is\r\nsufficient. Barkilphedro, having found this pretext, his position with\r\nthe queen soon became the same as that with the Duchess Josiana--that of\r\nan indispensable domestic animal. A witticism risked one day by him\r\nimmediately led to his perfect understanding of the queen and how to\r\nestimate exactly her kindness of heart. The queen was greatly attached\r\nto her Lord Steward, William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire, who was a\r\ngreat fool. This lord, who had obtained every Oxford degree and did not\r\nknow how to spell, one fine morning committed the folly of dying. To die\r\nis a very imprudent thing at court, for there is then no further\r\nrestraint in speaking of you. The queen, in the presence of\r\nBarkilphedro, lamented the event, finally exclaiming, with a sigh,--\r\n\r\n“It is a pity that so many virtues should have been borne and served by\r\nso poor an intellect.”\r\n\r\n“Dieu veuille avoir son âne!” whispered Barkilphedro, in a low voice,\r\nand in French.\r\n\r\nThe queen smiled. Barkilphedro noted the smile. His conclusion was that\r\nbiting pleased. Free licence had been given to his spite. From that day\r\nhe thrust his curiosity everywhere, and his malignity with it. He was\r\ngiven his way, so much was he feared. He who can make the king laugh\r\nmakes the others tremble. He was a powerful buffoon. Every day he worked\r\nhis way forward--underground. Barkilphedro became a necessity. Many\r\ngreat people honoured him with their confidence, to the extent of\r\ncharging him, when they required him, with their disgraceful\r\ncommissions.\r\n\r\nThere are wheels within wheels at court. Barkilphedro became the motive\r\npower. Have you remarked, in certain mechanisms, the smallness of the\r\nmotive wheel?\r\n\r\nJosiana, in particular, who, as we have explained, made use of\r\nBarkilphedro’s talents as a spy, reposed such confidence in him that she\r\nhad not hesitated to entrust him with one of the master-keys of her\r\napartments, by means of which he was able to enter them at any hour.\r\nThis excessive licence of insight into private life was in fashion in\r\nthe seventeenth century. It was called “giving the key.” Josiana had\r\ngiven two of these confidential keys--Lord David had one, Barkilphedro\r\nthe other. However, to enter straight into a bedchamber was, in the old\r\ncode of manners, a thing not in the least out of the way. Thence\r\nresulted incidents. La Ferté, suddenly drawing back the bed curtains of\r\nMademoiselle Lafont, found inside Sainson, the black musketeer, etc.,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro excelled in making the cunning discoveries which place the\r\ngreat in the power of the little. His walk in the dark was winding,\r\nsoft, clever. Like every perfect spy, he was composed of the inclemency\r\nof the executioner and the patience of a micograph. He was a born\r\ncourtier. Every courtier is a noctambulist. The courtier prowls in the\r\nnight, which is called power. He carries a dark lantern in his hand. He\r\nlights up the spot he wishes, and remains in darkness himself. What he\r\nseeks with his lantern is not a man, it is a fool. What he finds is the\r\nking.\r\n\r\nKings do not like to see those about them pretend to greatness. Irony\r\naimed at any one except themselves has a charm for them. The talent of\r\nBarkilphedro consisted in a perpetual dwarfing of the peers and princes\r\nto the advantage of her Majesty’s stature, thus increased in proportion.\r\nThe master-key held by Barkilphedro was made with two sets of wards, one\r\nat each end, so as to open the inner apartments in both Josiana’s\r\nfavourite residences--Hunkerville House in London, Corleone Lodge at\r\nWindsor. These two houses were part of the Clancharlie inheritance.\r\nHunkerville House was close to Oldgate. Oldgate was a gate of London,\r\nwhich was entered by the Harwich road, and on which was displayed a\r\nstatue of Charles II., with a painted angel on his head, and beneath his\r\nfeet a carved lion and unicorn. From Hunkerville House, in an easterly\r\nwind, you heard the peals of St. Marylebone. Corleone Lodge was a\r\nFlorentine palace of brick and stone, with a marble colonnade, built on\r\npilework, at Windsor, at the head of the wooden bridge, and having one\r\nof the finest courts in England.\r\n\r\nIn the latter palace, near Windsor Castle, Josiana was within the\r\nqueen’s reach. Nevertheless, Josiana liked it.\r\n\r\nScarcely anything in appearance, everything in the root, such was the\r\ninfluence of Barkilphedro over the queen. There is nothing more\r\ndifficult than to drag up these bad grasses of the court--they take a\r\ndeep root, and offer no hold above the surface. To root out a\r\nRoquelaure, a Triboulet, or a Brummel, is almost impossible.\r\n\r\nFrom day to day, and more and more, did the queen take Barkilphedro into\r\nher good graces. Sarah Jennings is famous; Barkilphedro is unknown. His\r\nexistence remains ignored. The name of Barkilphedro has not reached as\r\nfar as history. All the moles are not caught by the mole-trapper.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro, once a candidate for orders, had studied a little of\r\neverything. Skimming all things leaves naught for result. One may be\r\nvictim of the _omnis res scibilis_. Having the vessel of the Danaïdes in\r\none’s head is the misfortune of a whole race of learned men, who may be\r\ntermed the sterile. What Barkilphedro had put into his brain had left it\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nThe mind, like nature, abhors vacuum. Into emptiness nature puts love;\r\nthe mind often puts hate. Hate occupies.\r\n\r\nHate for hate’s sake exists. Art for art’s sake exists in nature more\r\nthan is believed. A man hates--he must do something. Gratuitous\r\nhate--formidable word! It means hate which is itself its own payment.\r\nThe bear lives by licking his claws. Not indefinitely, of course. The\r\nclaws must be revictualled--something must be put under them.\r\n\r\nHate indistinct is sweet, and suffices for a time; but one must end by\r\nhaving an object. An animosity diffused over creation is exhausting,\r\nlike every solitary pleasure. Hate without an object is like a\r\nshooting-match without a target. What lends interest to the game is a\r\nheart to be pierced. One cannot hate solely for honour; some seasoning\r\nis necessary--a man, a woman, somebody, to destroy. This service of\r\nmaking the game interesting; of offering an end; of throwing passion\r\ninto hate by fixing it on an object; of of amusing the hunter by the\r\nsight of his living prey; giving the watcher the hope of the smoking and\r\nboiling blood about to flow; of amusing the bird-catcher by the\r\ncredulity of the uselessly-winged lark; of being a victim, unknowingly\r\nreared for murder by a master-mind--all this exquisite and horrible\r\nservice, of which the person rendering it is unconscious, Josiana\r\nrendered Barkilphedro.\r\n\r\nThought is a projectile. Barkilphedro had, from the first day, begun to\r\naim at Josiana the evil intentions which were in his mind. An intention\r\nand a carbine are alike. Barkilphedro aimed at Josiana, directing\r\nagainst the duchess all his secret malice. That astonishes you! What has\r\nthe bird done at which you fire? You want to eat it, you say. And so it\r\nwas with Barkilphedro.\r\n\r\nJosiana could not be struck in the heart--the spot where the enigma lies\r\nis hard to wound; but she could be struck in the head--that is, in her\r\npride. It was there that she thought herself strong, and that she was\r\nweak.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro had found it out. If Josiana had been able to see clearly\r\nthrough the night of Barkilphedro, if she had been able to distinguish\r\nwhat lay in ambush behind his smile, that proud woman, so highly\r\nsituated, would have trembled. Fortunately for the tranquillity of her\r\nsleep, she was in complete ignorance of what was in the man.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected spreads, one knows not whence. The profound depths of\r\nlife are dangerous. There is no small hate. Hate is always enormous. It\r\npreserves its stature in the smallest being, and remains a monster. An\r\nelephant hated by a worm is in danger.\r\n\r\nEven before he struck, Barkilphedro felt, with joy, the foretaste of the\r\nevil action which he was about to commit. He did not as yet know what he\r\nwas going to do to Josiana; but he had made up his mind to do something.\r\nTo have come to this decision was a great step taken. To crush Josiana\r\nutterly would have been too great a triumph. He did not hope for so\r\nmuch; but to humiliate her, lessen her, bring her grief, redden her\r\nproud eyes with tears of rage--what a success! He counted on it.\r\nTenacious, diligent, faithful to the torment of his neighbour, not to\r\nbe torn from his purpose, nature had not formed him for nothing. He well\r\nunderstood how to find the flaw in Josiana’s golden armour, and how to\r\nmake the blood of that Olympian flow.\r\n\r\nWhat benefit, we ask again, would accrue to him in so doing? An immense\r\nbenefit--doing evil to one who had done good to him. What is an envious\r\nman? An ungrateful one. He hates the light which lights and warms him.\r\nZoilus hated that benefit to man, Homer. To inflict on Josiana what\r\nwould nowadays be called vivisection--to place her, all convulsed, on\r\nhis anatomical table; to dissect her alive, at his leisure, in some\r\nsurgery; to cut her up, as an amateur, while she should scream--this\r\ndream delighted Barkilphedro!\r\n\r\nTo arrive at this result it was necessary to suffer somewhat himself; he\r\ndid so willingly. We may pinch ourselves with our own pincers. The knife\r\nas it shuts cuts our fingers. What does it matter? That he should\r\npartake of Josiana’s torture was a matter of little moment. The\r\nexecutioner handling the red-hot iron, when about to brand a prisoner,\r\ntakes no heed of a little burn. Because another suffers much, he suffers\r\nnothing. To see the victim’s writhings takes all pain from the\r\ninflicter.\r\n\r\nDo harm, whatever happens.\r\n\r\nTo plan evil for others is mingled with an acceptance of some hazy\r\nresponsibility. We risk ourselves in the danger which we impel towards\r\nanother, because the chain of events sometimes, of course, brings\r\nunexpected accidents. This does not stop the man who is truly malicious.\r\nHe feels as much joy as the patient suffers agony. He is tickled by the\r\nlaceration of the victim. The malicious man blooms in hideous joy. Pain\r\nreflects itself on him in a sense of welfare. The Duke of Alva used to\r\nwarm his hands at the stake. The pile was torture, the reflection of it\r\npleasure. That such transpositions should be possible makes one shudder.\r\nOur dark side is unfathomable. _Supplice exquis_ (exquisite\r\ntorture)--the expression is in Bodin[12]--has perhaps this terrible\r\ntriple sense: search for the torture; suffering of the tortured; delight\r\nof the torturer.\r\n\r\nAmbition, appetite--all such words signify some one sacrificed to some\r\none satiated. It is sad that hope should be wicked. Is it that the\r\noutpourings of our wishes flow naturally to the direction to which we\r\nmost incline--that of evil? One of the hardest labours of the just man\r\nis to expunge from his soul a malevolence which it is difficult to\r\nefface. Almost all our desires, when examined, contain what we dare not\r\navow.\r\n\r\nIn the completely wicked man this exists in hideous perfection. So much\r\nthe worse for others, signifies so much the better for himself. The\r\nshadows of the caverns of man’s mind.\r\n\r\nJosiana, in a plenitude of security the fruit of ignorant pride, had a\r\ncontempt for all danger. The feminine faculty of disdain is\r\nextraordinary. Josiana’s disdain, unreasoning, involuntary, and\r\nconfident. Barkilphedro was to her so contemptible that she would have\r\nbeen astonished had any one remarked to her that such a creature\r\nexisted. She went, and came, and laughed before this man who was looking\r\nat her with evil eyes. Thoughtful, he bided his time.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as he waited, his determination to cast a despair into\r\nthis woman’s life augmented. Inexorable high tide of malice.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime he gave himself excellent reasons for his determination.\r\nIt must not be thought that scoundrels are deficient in self-esteem.\r\nThey enter into details with themselves in their lofty monologues, and\r\nthey take matters with a high hand. How? This Josiana had bestowed\r\ncharity on him! She had thrown some crumbs of her enormous wealth to\r\nhim, as to a beggar. She had nailed and riveted him to an office which\r\nwas unworthy him. Yes; that he, Barkilphedro, almost a clergyman, of\r\nvaried and profound talent, a learned man, with the material in him for\r\na bishop, should have for employ the registration of nasty\r\npatience-trying shards, that he should have to pass his life in the\r\ngarret of a register-office, gravely uncorking stupid bottles, incrusted\r\nwith all the nastiness of the sea, deciphering musty parchments, like\r\nfilthy conjuring-books, dirty wills, and other illegible stuff of the\r\nkind, was the fault of this Josiana. Worst of all, this creature\r\n“thee’d” and “thou’d” him! And he should not revenge himself--he should\r\nnot punish such conduct! Well, in that case there would no longer be\r\njustice on earth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE FLAME WHICH WOULD BE SEEN IF MAN WERE TRANSPARENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat! this woman, this extravagant thing, this libidinous dreamer, a\r\nvirgin until the opportunity occurred, this bit of flesh as yet unfreed,\r\nthis bold creature under a princess’s coronet; this Diana by pride, as\r\nyet untaken by the first comer, just because chance had so willed it;\r\nthis bastard of a low-lived king who had not the intellect to keep his\r\nplace; this duchess by a lucky hit, who, being a fine lady, played the\r\ngoddess, and who, had she been poor, would have been a prostitute; this\r\nlady, more or less, this robber of a proscribed man’s goods, this\r\noverbearing strumpet, because one day he, Barkilphedro, had not money\r\nenough to buy his dinner, and to get a lodging--she had had the\r\nimpudence to seat him in her house at the corner of a table, and to put\r\nhim up in some hole in her intolerable palace. Where? never mind where.\r\nPerhaps in the barn, perhaps in the cellar; what does it matter? A\r\nlittle better than her valets, a little worse than her horses. She had\r\nabused his distress--his, Barkilphedro’s--in hastening to do him\r\ntreacherous good; a thing which the rich do in order to humiliate the\r\npoor, and to tie them, like curs led by a string. Besides, what did the\r\nservice she rendered him cost her? A service is worth what it costs. She\r\nhad spare rooms in her house. She came to Barkilphedro’s aid! A great\r\nthing, indeed. Had she eaten a spoonful the less of turtle soup for it?\r\nhad she deprived herself of anything in the hateful overflowing of her\r\nsuperfluous luxuries? No. She had added to it a vanity, a luxury, a good\r\naction like a ring on her finger, the relief of a man of wit, the\r\npatronization of a clergyman. She could give herself airs: say, “I\r\nlavish kindness; I fill the mouths of men of letters; I am his\r\nbenefactress. How lucky the wretch was to find me out! What a patroness\r\nof the arts I am!” All for having set up a truckle bed in a wretched\r\ngarret in the roof. As for the place in the Admiralty, Barkilphedro owed\r\nit to Josiana; by Jove, a pretty appointment! Josiana had made\r\nBarkilphedro what he was. She had created him. Be it so. Yes, created\r\nnothing--less than nothing. For in his absurd situation he felt borne\r\ndown, tongue-tied, disfigured. What did he owe Josiana? The thanks due\r\nfrom a hunchback to the mother who bore him deformed. Behold your\r\nprivileged ones, your folks overwhelmed with fortune, your parvenus,\r\nyour favourites of that horrid stepmother Fortune! And that man of\r\ntalent, Barkilphedro, was obliged to stand on staircases, to bow to\r\nfootmen, to climb to the top of the house at night, to be courteous,\r\nassiduous, pleasant, respectful, and to have ever on his muzzle a\r\nrespectful grimace! Was not it enough to make him gnash his teeth with\r\nrage! And all the while she was putting pearls round her neck, and\r\nmaking amorous poses to her fool, Lord David Dirry-Moir; the hussy!\r\n\r\nNever let any one do you a service. They will abuse the advantage it\r\ngives them. Never allow yourself to be taken in the act of inanition.\r\nThey would relieve you. Because he was starving, this woman had found it\r\na sufficient pretext to give him bread. From that moment he was her\r\nservant; a craving of the stomach, and there is a chain for life! To be\r\nobliged is to be sold. The happy, the powerful, make use of the moment\r\nyou stretch out your hand to place a penny in it, and at the crisis of\r\nyour weakness make you a slave, and a slave of the worst kind, the slave\r\nof an act of charity--a slave forced to love the enslaver. What infamy!\r\nwhat want of delicacy! what an assault on your self-respect! Then all is\r\nover. You are sentenced for life to consider this man good, that woman\r\nbeautiful; to remain in the back rows; to approve, to applaud, to\r\nadmire, to worship, to prostrate yourself, to blister your knees by long\r\ngenuflections, to sugar your words when you are gnawing your lips with\r\nanger, when you are biting down your cries of fury, and when you have\r\nwithin you more savage turbulence and more bitter foam than the ocean!\r\n\r\nIt is thus that the rich make prisoners of the poor.\r\n\r\nThis slime of a good action performed towards you bedaubs and bespatters\r\nyou with mud for ever.\r\n\r\nAn alms is irremediable. Gratitude is paralysis. A benefit is a sticky\r\nand repugnant adherence which deprives you of free movement. Those\r\nodious, opulent, and spoiled creatures whose pity has thus injured you\r\nare well aware of this. It is done--you are their creature. They have\r\nbought you--and how? By a bone taken from their dog and cast to you.\r\nThey have flung that bone at your head. You have been stoned as much as\r\nbenefited. It is all one. Have you gnawed the bone--yes or no? You have\r\nhad your place in the dog-kennel as well. Then be thankful--be ever\r\nthankful. Adore your masters. Kneel on indefinitely. A benefit implies\r\nan understood inferiority accepted by you. It means that you feel them\r\nto be gods and yourself a poor devil. Your diminution augments them.\r\nYour bent form makes theirs more upright. In the tones of their voices\r\nthere is an impertinent inflexion. Their family matters--their\r\nmarriages, their baptisms, their child-bearings, their progeny--all\r\nconcern you. A wolf cub is born to them. Well, you have to compose a\r\nsonnet. You are a poet because you are low. Isn’t it enough to make the\r\nstars fall! A little more, and they would make you wear their old shoes.\r\n\r\n“Who have you got there, my dear? How ugly he is! Who is that man?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know. A sort of scholar, whom I feed.”\r\n\r\nThus converse these idiots, without even lowering their voice. You hear,\r\nand remain mechanically amiable. If you are ill, your masters will send\r\nfor the doctor--not their own. Occasionally they may even inquire after\r\nyou. Being of a different species from you, and at an inaccessible\r\nheight above you, they are affable. Their height makes them easy. They\r\nknow that equality is impossible. By force of disdain they are polite.\r\nAt table they give you a little nod. Sometimes they absolutely know how\r\nyour name is spelt! They only show that they are your protectors by\r\nwalking unconsciously over all the delicacy and susceptibility you\r\npossess. They treat you with good-nature. Is all this to be borne?\r\n\r\nNo doubt he was eager to punish Josiana. He must teach her with whom she\r\nhad to deal!\r\n\r\nO my rich gentry, because you cannot eat up everything, because opulence\r\nproduces indigestion seeing that your stomachs are no bigger than ours,\r\nbecause it is, after all, better to distribute the remainder than to\r\nthrow it away, you exalt a morsel flung to the poor into an act of\r\nmagnificence. Oh, you give us bread, you give us shelter, you give us\r\nclothes, you give us employment, and you push audacity, folly, cruelty,\r\nstupidity, and absurdity to the pitch of believing that we are grateful!\r\nThe bread is the bread of servitude, the shelter is a footman’s bedroom,\r\nthe clothes are a livery, the employment is ridiculous, paid for, it is\r\ntrue, but brutalizing.\r\n\r\nOh, you believe in the right to humiliate us with lodging and\r\nnourishment, and you imagine that we are your debtors, and you count on\r\nour gratitude! Very well; we will eat up your substance, we will devour\r\nyou alive and gnaw your heart-strings with our teeth.\r\n\r\nThis Josiana! Was it not absurd? What merit had she? She had\r\naccomplished the wonderful work of coming into the world as a testimony\r\nof the folly of her father and the shame of her mother. She had done us\r\nthe favour to exist, and for her kindness in becoming a public scandal\r\nthey paid her millions; she had estates and castles, warrens, parks,\r\nlakes, forests, and I know not what besides, and with all that she was\r\nmaking a fool of herself, and verses were addressed to her! And\r\nBarkilphedro, who had studied and laboured and taken pains, and stuffed\r\nhis eyes and his brain with great books, who had grown mouldy in old\r\nworks and in science, who was full of wit, who could command armies, who\r\ncould, if he would, write tragedies like Otway and Dryden, who was made\r\nto be an emperor--Barkilphedro had been reduced to permit this nobody to\r\nprevent him from dying of hunger. Could the usurpation of the rich, the\r\nhateful elect of chance, go further? They put on the semblance of being\r\ngenerous to us, of protecting us, and of smiling on us, and we would\r\ndrink their blood and lick our lips after it! That this low woman of the\r\ncourt should have the odious power of being a benefactress, and that a\r\nman so superior should be condemned to pick up such bribes falling from\r\nsuch a hand, what a frightful iniquity! And what social system is this\r\nwhich has for its base disproportion and injustice? Would it not be best\r\nto take it by the four corners, and to throw pell-mell to the ceiling\r\nthe damask tablecloth, and the festival, and the orgies, and the\r\ntippling and drunkenness, and the guests, and those with their elbows on\r\nthe table, and those with their paws under it, and the insolent who give\r\nand the idiots who accept, and to spit it all back again in the face of\r\nProvidence, and fling all the earth to the heavens? In the meantime let\r\nus stick our claws into Josiana.\r\n\r\nThus dreamed Barkilphedro. Such were the ragings of his soul. It is the\r\nhabit of the envious man to absolve himself, amalgamating with his\r\npersonal grievance the public wrongs.\r\n\r\nAll the wild forms of hateful passions went and came in the intellect\r\nof this ferocious being. At the corners of old maps of the world of the\r\nfifteenth century are great vague spaces without shape or name, on which\r\nare written these three words, _Hic sunt leones_. Such a dark corner is\r\nthere also in man. Passions grow and growl somewhere within us, and we\r\nmay say of an obscure portion of our souls, “There are lions here.”\r\n\r\nIs this scaffolding of wild reasoning absolutely absurd? does it lack a\r\ncertain justice? We must confess it does not.\r\n\r\nIt is fearful to think that judgment within us is not justice. Judgment\r\nis the relative, justice is the absolute. Think of the difference\r\nbetween a judge and a just man.\r\n\r\nWicked men lead conscience astray with authority. There are gymnastics\r\nof untruth. A sophist is a forger, and this forger sometimes brutalizes\r\ngood sense.\r\n\r\nA certain logic, very supple, very implacable, and very agile, is at the\r\nservice of evil, and excels in stabbing truth in the dark. These are\r\nblows struck by the devil at Providence.\r\n\r\nThe worst of it was that Barkilphedro had a presentiment. He was\r\nundertaking a heavy task, and he was afraid that after all the evil\r\nachieved might not be proportionate to the work.\r\n\r\nTo be corrosive as he was, to have within himself a will of steel, a\r\nhate of diamond, a burning curiosity for the catastrophe, and to burn\r\nnothing, to decapitate nothing, to exterminate nothing; to be what he\r\nwas, a force of devastation, a voracious animosity, a devourer of the\r\nhappiness of others, to have been created (for there is a creator,\r\nwhether God or devil), to have been created Barkilphedro all over, and\r\nto inflict perhaps after all but a fillip of the finger--could this be\r\npossible? could it be that Barkilphedro should miss his aim? To be a\r\nlever powerful enough to heave great masses of rock, and when sprung to\r\nthe utmost power to succeed only in giving an affected woman a bump in\r\nthe forehead--to be a catapult dealing ruin on a pole-kitten! To\r\naccomplish the task of Sisyphus, to crush an ant; to sweat all over with\r\nhate, and for nothing at all. Would not this be humiliating, when he\r\nfelt himself a mechanism of hostility capable of reducing the world to\r\npowder! To put into movement all the wheels within wheels, to work in\r\nthe darkness all the mechanism of a Marly machine, and to succeed\r\nperhaps in pinching the end of a little rosy finger! He was to turn over\r\nand over blocks of marble, perchance with the result of ruffling a\r\nlittle the smooth surface of the court! Providence has a way of thus\r\nexpending forces grandly. The movement of a mountain often only\r\ndisplaces a molehill.\r\n\r\nBesides this, when the court is the dangerous arena, nothing is more\r\ndangerous than to aim at your enemy and miss him. In the first place, it\r\nunmasks you and irritates him; but besides and above all, it displeases\r\nthe master. Kings do not like the unskilful. Let us have no contusions,\r\nno ugly gashes. Kill anybody, but give no one a bloody nose. He who\r\nkills is clever, he who wounds awkward. Kings do not like to see their\r\nservants lamed. They are displeased if you chip a porcelain jar on their\r\nchimney-piece or a courtier in their cortège. The court must be kept\r\nneat. Break and replace; that does not matter. Besides, all this agrees\r\nperfectly with the taste of princes for scandal. Speak evil, do none; or\r\nif you do, let it be in grand style.\r\n\r\nStab, do not scratch, unless the pin be poisoned. This would be an\r\nextenuating circumstance, and was, we may remember, the case with\r\nBarkilphedro.\r\n\r\nEvery malicious pigmy is a phial in which is enclosed the dragon of\r\nSolomon. The phial is microscopic, the dragon immense. A formidable\r\ncondensation, awaiting the gigantic hour of dilation! Ennui consoled by\r\nthe premeditation of explosion! The prisoner is larger than the prison.\r\nA latent giant! how wonderful! A minnow in which is contained a hydra.\r\nTo be this fearful magical box, to contain within him a leviathan, is to\r\nthe dwarf both a torture and a delight.\r\n\r\nNor would anything have caused Barkilphedro to let go his hold. He\r\nawaited his time. Was it to come? What mattered that? He watched for it.\r\nSelf-love is mixed up in the malice of the very wicked man. To make\r\nholes and gaps in a court fortune higher than your own, to undermine it\r\nat all risks and perils, while encased and concealed yourself, is, we\r\nrepeat, exceedingly interesting. The player at such a game becomes\r\neager, even to passion. He throws himself into the work as if he were\r\ncomposing an epic. To be very mean, and to attack that which is great,\r\nis in itself a brilliant action. It is a fine thing to be a flea on a\r\nlion.\r\n\r\nThe noble beast feels the bite, and expends his mighty anger against\r\nthe atom. An encounter with a tiger would weary him less; see how the\r\nactors exchange their parts. The lion, humiliated, feels the sting of\r\nthe insect; and the flea can say, “I have in my veins the blood of a\r\nlion.”\r\n\r\nHowever, these reflections but half appeased the cravings of\r\nBarkilphedro’s pride. Consolations, palliations at most. To vex is one\r\nthing; to torment would be infinitely better. Barkilphedro had a thought\r\nwhich returned to him without ceasing: his success might not go beyond\r\njust irritating the epidermis of Josiana. What could he hope for\r\nmore--he so obscure against her so radiant? A scratch is worth but\r\nlittle to him who longs to see the crimson blood of his flayed victim,\r\nand to hear her cries as she lies before him more than naked, without\r\neven that garment the skin! With such a craving, how sad to be\r\npowerless!\r\n\r\nAlas, there is nothing perfect!\r\n\r\nHowever, he resigned himself. Not being able to do better, he only\r\ndreamed half his dream. To play a treacherous trick is an object after\r\nall.\r\n\r\nWhat a man is he who revenges himself for a benefit received!\r\nBarkilphedro was a giant among such men. Usually, ingratitude is\r\nforgetfulness. With this man, patented in wickedness, it was fury. The\r\nvulgar ingrate is full of ashes; what was within Barkilphedro? A\r\nfurnace--furnace walled round by hate, silence, and rancour, awaiting\r\nJosiana for fuel. Never had a man abhorred a woman to such a point\r\nwithout reason. How terrible! She was his dream, his preoccupation, his\r\nennui, his rage.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was a little in love with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nBARKILPHEDRO IN AMBUSCADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo find the vulnerable spot in Josiana, and to strike her there, was,\r\nfor all the causes we have just mentioned, the imperturbable\r\ndetermination of Barkilphedro. The wish is sufficient; the power is\r\nrequired. How was he to set about it? There was the question.\r\n\r\nVulgar vagabonds set the scene of any wickedness they intend to commit\r\nwith care. They do not feel themselves strong enough to seize the\r\nopportunity as it passes, to take possession of it by fair means or\r\nfoul, and to constrain it to serve them. Deep scoundrels disdain\r\npreliminary combinations. They start from their villainies alone, merely\r\narming themselves all round, prepared to avail themselves of various\r\nchances which may occur, and then, like Barkilphedro, await the\r\nopportunity. They know that a ready-made scheme runs the risk of fitting\r\nill into the event which may present itself. It is not thus that a man\r\nmakes himself master of possibilities and guides them as one pleases.\r\nYou can come to no previous arrangement with destiny. To-morrow will not\r\nobey you. There is a certain want of discipline in chance.\r\n\r\nTherefore they watch for it, and summon it suddenly, authoritatively, on\r\nthe spot. No plan, no sketch, no rough model; no ready-made shoe\r\nill-fitting the unexpected. They plunge headlong into the dark. To turn\r\nto immediate and rapid profit any circumstance that can aid him is the\r\nquality which distinguishes the able scoundrel, and elevates the villain\r\ninto the demon. To strike suddenly at fortune, _that_ is true genius.\r\n\r\nThe true scoundrel strikes you from a sling with the first stone he can\r\npick up. Clever malefactors count on the unexpected, that senseless\r\naccomplice of so many crimes. They grasp the incident and leap on it;\r\nthere is no better _Ars Poetica_ for this species of talent. Meanwhile\r\nbe sure with whom you have to deal. Survey the ground.\r\n\r\nWith Barkilphedro the ground was Queen Anne. Barkilphedro approached the\r\nqueen, and so close that sometimes he fancied he heard the monologues of\r\nher Majesty. Sometimes he was present unheeded at conversations between\r\nthe sisters. Neither did they forbid his sliding in a word. He profited\r\nby this to lessen himself--a way of inspiring confidence. Thus one day\r\nin the garden at Hampton Court, being behind the duchess, who was behind\r\nthe queen, he heard Anne, following the fashion, awkwardly enunciating\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\n“Animals are happy,” said the queen. “They run no risk of going to\r\nhell.”\r\n\r\n“They are there already,” replied Josiana.\r\n\r\nThis answer, which bluntly substituted philosophy for religion,\r\ndispleased the queen. If, perchance, there was depth in the observation,\r\nAnne felt shocked.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said she to Josiana, “we talk of hell like a couple of\r\nfools. Ask Barkilphedro all about it. He ought to know such things.”\r\n\r\n“As a devil?” said Josiana.\r\n\r\n“As a beast,” replied Barkilphedro, with a bow.\r\n\r\n“Madam,” said the queen to Josiana, “he is cleverer than we.”\r\n\r\nFor a man like Barkilphedro to approach the queen was to obtain a hold\r\non her. He could say, “I hold her.” Now, he wanted a means of taking\r\nadvantage of his power for his own benefit. He had his foothold in the\r\ncourt. To be settled there was a fine thing. No chance could now escape\r\nhim. More than once he had made the queen smile maliciously. This was\r\nhaving a licence to shoot. But was there any preserved game? Did this\r\nlicence to shoot permit him to break the wing or the leg of one like the\r\nsister of her Majesty? The first point to make clear was, did the queen\r\nlove her sister? One false step would lose all. Barkilphedro watched.\r\n\r\nBefore he plays the player looks at the cards. What trumps has he?\r\nBarkilphedro began by examining the age of the two women. Josiana,\r\ntwenty-three; Anne, forty-one. So far so good. He held trumps. The\r\nmoment that a woman ceases to count by springs, and begins to count by\r\nwinters, she becomes cross. A dull rancour possesses her against the\r\ntime of which she carries the proofs. Fresh-blown beauties, perfumes for\r\nothers, are to such a one but thorns. Of the roses she feels but the\r\nprick. It seems as if all the freshness is stolen from her, and that\r\nbeauty decreases in her because it increases in others.\r\n\r\nTo profit by this secret ill-humour, to dive into the wrinkle on the\r\nface of this woman of forty, who was a queen, seemed a good game for\r\nBarkilphedro.\r\n\r\nEnvy excels in exciting jealousy, as a rat draws the crocodile from its\r\nhole.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro fixed his wise gaze on Anne. He saw into the queen as one\r\nsees into a stagnant pool. The marsh has its transparency. In dirty\r\nwater we see vices, in muddy water we see stupidity; Anne was muddy\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nEmbryos of sentiments and larvæ of ideas moved in her thick brain. They\r\nwere not distinct; they had scarcely any outline. But they were\r\nrealities, however shapeless. The queen thought this; the queen desired\r\nthat. To decide what was the difficulty. The confused transformations\r\nwhich work in stagnant water are difficult to study. The queen,\r\nhabitually obscure, sometimes made sudden and stupid revelations. It was\r\non these that it was necessary to seize. He must take advantage of them\r\non the moment. How did the queen feel towards the Duchess Josiana? Did\r\nshe wish her good or evil?\r\n\r\nHere was the problem. Barkilphedro set himself to solve it. This problem\r\nsolved, he might go further.\r\n\r\nDivers chances served Barkilphedro--his tenacity at the watch above all.\r\n\r\nAnne was, on her husband’s side, slightly related to the new Queen of\r\nPrussia, wife of the king with the hundred chamberlains. She had her\r\nportrait painted on enamel, after the process of Turquet of Mayerne.\r\nThis Queen of Prussia had also a younger illegitimate sister, the\r\nBaroness Drika.\r\n\r\nOne day, in the presence of Barkilphedro, Anne asked the Russian\r\nambassador some question about this Drika.\r\n\r\n“They say she is rich?”\r\n\r\n“Very rich.”\r\n\r\n“She has palaces?”\r\n\r\n“More magnificent than those of her sister, the queen.”\r\n\r\n“Whom will she marry?”\r\n\r\n“A great lord, the Count Gormo.”\r\n\r\n“Pretty?”\r\n\r\n“Charming.”\r\n\r\n“Is she young?”\r\n\r\n“Very young.”\r\n\r\n“As beautiful as the queen?”\r\n\r\nThe ambassador lowered his voice, and replied,--\r\n\r\n“More beautiful.”\r\n\r\n“That is insolent,” murmured Barkilphedro.\r\n\r\nThe queen was silent; then she exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“Those bastards!”\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro noticed the plural.\r\n\r\nAnother time, when the queen was leaving the chapel, Barkilphedro kept\r\npretty close to her Majesty, behind the two grooms of the almonry. Lord\r\nDavid Dirry-Moir, crossing the ranks of women, made a sensation by his\r\nhandsome appearance. As he passed there was an explosion of feminine\r\nexclamations.\r\n\r\n“How elegant! How gallant! What a noble air! How handsome!”\r\n\r\n“How disagreeable!” grumbled the queen.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro overheard this; it decided him.\r\n\r\nHe could hurt the duchess without displeasing the queen. The first\r\nproblem was solved; but now the second presented itself.\r\n\r\nWhat could he do to harm the duchess? What means did his wretched\r\nappointment offer to attain so difficult an object?\r\n\r\nEvidently none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSCOTLAND, IRELAND, AND ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us note a circumstance. Josiana had _le tour_.\r\n\r\nThis is easy to understand when we reflect that she was, although\r\nillegitimate, the queen’s sister--that is to say, a princely personage.\r\n\r\nTo have _le tour_--what does it mean?\r\n\r\nViscount St. John, otherwise Bolingbroke, wrote as follows to Thomas\r\nLennard, Earl of Sussex:--\r\n\r\n“Two things mark the great--in England, they have _le tour;_ in France,\r\n_le pour_.”\r\n\r\nWhen the King of France travelled, the courier of the court stopped at\r\nthe halting-place in the evening, and assigned lodgings to his Majesty’s\r\nsuite.\r\n\r\nAmongst the gentlemen some had an immense privilege. “They have _le\r\npour_” says the _Journal Historique_ for the year 1694, page 6; “which\r\nmeans that the courier who marks the billets puts ‘_pour_’ before their\r\nnames--as, ‘_Pour_ M. le Prince de Soubise;’ instead of which, when he\r\nmarks the lodging of one who is not royal, he does not put _pour_, but\r\nsimply the name--as, ‘Le Duc de Gesvres, le Duc de Mazarin.’” This\r\n_pour_ on a door indicated a prince or a favourite. A favourite is worse\r\nthan a prince. The king granted _le pour_, like a blue ribbon or a\r\npeerage.\r\n\r\n_Avoir le tour_ in England was less glorious but more real. It was a\r\nsign of intimate communication with the sovereign. Whoever might be, by\r\nbirth or favour, in a position to receive direct communications from\r\nmajesty, had in the wall of their bedchamber a shaft in which was\r\nadjusted a bell. The bell sounded, the shaft opened, a royal missive\r\nappeared on a gold plate or on a cushion of velvet, and the shaft\r\nclosed. This was intimate and solemn, the mysterious in the familiar.\r\nThe shaft was used for no other purpose. The sound of the bell announced\r\na royal message. No one saw who brought it. It was of course merely the\r\npage of the king or the queen. Leicester _avait le tour_ under\r\nElizabeth; Buckingham under James I. Josiana had it under Anne, though\r\nnot much in favour. Never was a privilege more envied.\r\n\r\nThis privilege entailed additional servility. The recipient was more of\r\na servant. At court that which elevates, degrades. _Avoir le tour_ was\r\nsaid in French; this circumstance of English etiquette having, probably,\r\nbeen borrowed from some old French folly.\r\n\r\nLady Josiana, a virgin peeress as Elizabeth had been a virgin queen,\r\nled--sometimes in the City, and sometimes in the country, according to\r\nthe season--an almost princely life, and kept nearly a court, at which\r\nLord David was courtier, with many others.\r\n\r\nNot being married, Lord David and Lady Josiana could show themselves\r\ntogether in public without exciting ridicule, and they did so\r\nfrequently. They often went to plays and racecourses in the same\r\ncarriage, and sat together in the same box. They were chilled by the\r\nimpending marriage, which was not only permitted to them, but imposed\r\nupon them; but they felt an attraction for each other’s society. The\r\nprivacy permitted to the engaged has a frontier easily passed. From this\r\nthey abstained; that which is easy is in bad taste.\r\n\r\nThe best pugilistic encounters then took place at Lambeth, a parish in\r\nwhich the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury has a palace though the air\r\nthere is unhealthy, and a rich library open at certain hours to decent\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nOne evening in winter there was in a meadow there, the gates of which\r\nwere locked, a fight, at which Josiana, escorted by Lord David, was\r\npresent. She had asked,--\r\n\r\n“Are women admitted?”\r\n\r\nAnd David had responded,--\r\n\r\n“_Sunt fæminae magnates!_”\r\n\r\nLiberal translation, “Not shopkeepers.” Literal translation, “Great\r\nladies exist. A duchess goes everywhere!”\r\n\r\nThis is why Lady Josiana saw a boxing match.\r\n\r\nLady Josiana made only this concession to propriety--she dressed as a\r\nman, a very common custom at that period. Women seldom travelled\r\notherwise. Out of every six persons who travelled by the coach from\r\nWindsor, it was rare that there were not one or two amongst them who\r\nwere women in male attire; a certain sign of high birth.\r\n\r\nLord David, being in company with a woman, could not take any part in\r\nthe match himself, and merely assisted as one of the audience.\r\n\r\nLady Josiana betrayed her quality in one way; she had an opera-glass,\r\nthen used by gentlemen only.\r\n\r\nThis encounter in the noble science was presided over by Lord Germaine,\r\ngreat-grandfather, or grand-uncle, of that Lord Germaine who, towards\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century, was colonel, ran away in a battle,\r\nwas afterwards made Minister of War, and only escaped from the bolts of\r\nthe enemy, to fall by a worse fate, shot through and through by the\r\nsarcasm of Sheridan.\r\n\r\nMany gentlemen were betting. Harry Bellew, of Carleton, who had claims\r\nto the extinct peerage of Bella-aqua, with Henry, Lord Hyde, member of\r\nParliament for the borough of Dunhivid, which is also called Launceston;\r\nthe Honourable Peregrine Bertie, member for the borough of Truro, with\r\nSir Thomas Colpepper, member for Maidstone; the Laird of Lamyrbau, which\r\nis on the borders of Lothian, with Samuel Trefusis, of the borough of\r\nPenryn; Sir Bartholomew Gracedieu, of the borough of Saint Ives, with\r\nthe Honourable Charles Bodville, who was called Lord Robartes, and who\r\nwas Custos Rotulorum of the county of Cornwall; besides many others.\r\n\r\nOf the two combatants, one was an Irishman, named after his native\r\nmountain in Tipperary, Phelem-ghe-Madone, and the other a Scot, named\r\nHelmsgail.\r\n\r\nThey represented the national pride of each country. Ireland and\r\nScotland were about to set to; Erin was going to fisticuff Gajothel. So\r\nthat the bets amounted to over forty thousand guineas, besides the\r\nstakes.\r\n\r\nThe two champions were naked, excepting short breeches buckled over the\r\nhips, and spiked boots laced as high as the ankles.\r\n\r\nHelmsgail, the Scot, was a youth scarcely nineteen, but he had already\r\nhad his forehead sewn up, for which reason they laid 2 1/3 to 1 on him.\r\nThe month before he had broken the ribs and gouged out the eyes of a\r\npugilist named Sixmileswater. This explained the enthusiasm he created.\r\nHe had won his backers twelve thousand pounds. Besides having his\r\nforehead sewn up Helmsgail’s jaw had been broken. He was neatly made and\r\nactive. He was about the height of a small woman, upright, thick-set,\r\nand of a stature low and threatening. And nothing had been lost of the\r\nadvantages given him by nature; not a muscle which was not trained to\r\nits object, pugilism. His firm chest was compact, and brown and shining\r\nlike brass. He smiled, and three teeth which he had lost added to his\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nHis adversary was tall and overgrown--that is to say, weak.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of forty years of age, six feet high, with the chest of a\r\nhippopotamus, and a mild expression of face. The blow of his fist would\r\nbreak in the deck of a vessel, but he did not know how to use it.\r\n\r\nThe Irishman, Phelem-ghe-Madone, was all surface, and seemed to have\r\nentered the ring to receive rather than to give blows. Only it was felt\r\nthat he would take a deal of punishment. Like underdone beef, tough to\r\nchew, and impossible to swallow. He was what was termed, in local slang,\r\nraw meat. He squinted. He seemed resigned.\r\n\r\nThe two men had passed the preceding night in the same bed, and had\r\nslept together. They had each drunk port wine from the same glass, to\r\nthe three-inch mark.\r\n\r\nEach had his group of seconds--men of savage expression, threatening the\r\numpires when it suited their side. Amongst Helmsgail’s supporters was to\r\nbe seen John Gromane, celebrated for having carried an ox on his back;\r\nand one called John Bray, who had once carried on his back ten bushels\r\nof flour, at fifteen pecks to the bushel, besides the miller himself,\r\nand had walked over two hundred paces under the weight. On the side of\r\nPhelem-ghe-Madone, Lord Hyde had brought from Launceston a certain\r\nKilter, who lived at Green Castle, and could throw a stone weighing\r\ntwenty pounds to a greater height than the highest tower of the castle.\r\n\r\nThese three men, Kilter, Bray, and Gromane, were Cornishmen by birth,\r\nand did honour to their county.\r\n\r\nThe other seconds were brutal fellows, with broad backs, bowed legs,\r\nknotted fists, dull faces; ragged, fearing nothing, nearly all\r\njail-birds.\r\n\r\nMany of them understood admirably how to make the police drunk. Each\r\nprofession should have its peculiar talents.\r\n\r\nThe field chosen was farther off than the bear garden, where they\r\nformerly baited bears, bulls, and dogs; it was beyond the line of the\r\nfarthest houses, by the side of the ruins of the Priory of Saint Mary\r\nOvery, dismantled by Henry VIII. The wind was northerly, and biting; a\r\nsmall rain fell, which was instantly frozen into ice. Some gentlemen\r\npresent were evidently fathers of families, recognized as such by their\r\nputting up their umbrellas.\r\n\r\nOn the side of Phelem-ghe-Madone was Colonel Moncreif, as umpire; and\r\nKilter, as second, to support him on his knee.\r\n\r\nOn the side of Helmsgail, the Honourable Pughe Beaumaris was umpire,\r\nwith Lord Desertum, from Kilcarry, as bottle-holder, to support him on\r\nhis knee.\r\n\r\nThe two combatants stood for a few seconds motionless in the ring,\r\nwhilst the watches were being compared. They then approached each other\r\nand shook hands.\r\n\r\nPhelem-ghe-Madone said to Helmsgail,--\r\n\r\n“I should prefer going home.”\r\n\r\nHelmsgail answered, handsomely,--\r\n\r\n“The gentlemen must not be disappointed, on any account.”\r\n\r\nNaked as they were, they felt the cold. Phelem-ghe-Madone shook. His\r\nteeth chattered.\r\n\r\nDr. Eleanor Sharpe, nephew of the Archbishop of York, cried out to\r\nthem,--\r\n\r\n“Set to, boys; it will warm you.”\r\n\r\nThose friendly words thawed them.\r\n\r\nThey set to.\r\n\r\nBut neither one nor the other was angry. There were three ineffectual\r\nrounds. The Rev. Doctor Gumdraith, one of the forty Fellows of All\r\nSouls’ College, cried,--\r\n\r\n“Spirit them up with gin.”\r\n\r\nBut the two umpires and the two seconds adhered to the rule. Yet it was\r\nexceedingly cold.\r\n\r\nFirst blood was claimed.\r\n\r\nThey were again set face to face.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other, approached, stretched their arms, touched\r\neach other’s fists, and then drew back.\r\n\r\nAll at once, Helmsgail, the little man, sprang forward. The real fight\r\nhad begun.\r\n\r\nPhelem-ghe-Madone was struck in the face, between the eyes. His whole\r\nface streamed with blood. The crowd cried,--\r\n\r\n“Helmsgail has tapped his claret!”\r\n\r\nThere was applause. Phelem-ghe-Madone, turning his arms like the sails\r\nof a windmill, struck out at random.\r\n\r\nThe Honourable Peregrine Bertie said, “Blinded;” but he was not blind\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nThen Helmsgail heard on all sides these encouraging words,--\r\n\r\n“Bung up his peepers!”\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the two champions were really well matched; and,\r\nnotwithstanding the unfavourable weather, it was seen that the fight\r\nwould be a success.\r\n\r\nThe great giant, Phelem-ghe-Madone, had to bear the inconveniences of\r\nhis advantages; he moved heavily. His arms were massive as clubs; but\r\nhis chest was a mass. His little opponent ran, struck, sprang, gnashed\r\nhis teeth; redoubling vigour by quickness, from knowledge of the\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nOn the one side was the primitive blow of the fist--savage,\r\nuncultivated, in a state of ignorance; on the other side, the civilized\r\nblow of the fist. Helmsgail fought as much with his nerves as with his\r\nmuscles, and with as much intention as force. Phelem-ghe-Madone was a\r\nkind of sluggish mauler--somewhat mauled himself, to begin with. It was\r\nart against nature. It was cultivated ferocity against barbarism.\r\n\r\nIt was clear that the barbarian would be beaten, but not very quickly.\r\nHence the interest.\r\n\r\nA little man against a big one, and the chances are in favour of the\r\nlittle one. The cat has the best of it with a dog. Goliaths are always\r\nvanquished by Davids.\r\n\r\nA hail of exclamations followed the combatants.\r\n\r\n“Bravo, Helmsgail! Good! Well done, Highlander! Now, Phelem!”\r\n\r\nAnd the friends of Helmsgail repeated their benevolent exhortation,--\r\n\r\n“Bung up his peepers!”\r\n\r\nHelmsgail did better. Rapidly bending down and back again, with the\r\nundulation of a serpent, he struck Phelem-ghe-Madone in the sternum. The\r\nColossus staggered.\r\n\r\n“Foul blow!” cried Viscount Barnard.\r\n\r\nPhelem-ghe-Madone sank down on the knee of his second, saying,--\r\n\r\n“I am beginning to get warm.”\r\n\r\nLord Desertum consulted the umpires, and said,--\r\n\r\n“Five minutes before time is called.”\r\n\r\nPhelem-ghe-Madone was becoming weaker. Kilter wiped the blood from his\r\nface and the sweat from his body with a flannel, and placed the neck of\r\na bottle to his mouth. They had come to the eleventh round. Phelem,\r\nbesides the scar on his forehead, had his breast disfigured by blows,\r\nhis belly swollen, and the fore part of the head scarified. Helmsgail\r\nwas untouched.\r\n\r\nA kind of tumult arose amongst the gentlemen.\r\n\r\nLord Barnard repeated, “Foul blow.”\r\n\r\n“Bets void!” said the Laird of Lamyrbau.\r\n\r\n“I claim my stake!” replied Sir Thomas Colpepper.\r\n\r\nAnd the honourable member for the borough of Saint Ives, Sir Bartholomew\r\nGracedieu, added, “Give me back my five hundred guineas, and I will go.\r\nStop the fight.”\r\n\r\nPhelem arose, staggering like a drunken man, and said,--\r\n\r\n“Let us go on fighting, on one condition--that I also shall have the\r\nright to give one foul blow.”\r\n\r\nThey cried “Agreed!” from all parts of the ring. Helmsgail shrugged his\r\nshoulders. Five minutes elapsed, and they set to again.\r\n\r\nThe fighting, which was agony to Phelem, was play to Helmsgail. Such are\r\nthe triumphs of science.\r\n\r\nThe little man found means of putting the big one into chancery--that is\r\nto say, Helmsgail suddenly took under his left arm, which was bent like\r\na steel crescent, the huge head of Phelem-ghe-Madone, and held it there\r\nunder his armpits, the neck bent and twisted, whilst Helmsgail’s right\r\nfist fell again and again like a hammer on a nail, only from below and\r\nstriking upwards, thus smashing his opponent’s face at his ease. When\r\nPhelem, released at length, lifted his head, he had no longer a face.\r\n\r\nThat which had been a nose, eyes, and a mouth now looked only like a\r\nblack sponge, soaked in blood. He spat, and on the ground lay four of\r\nhis teeth.\r\n\r\nThen he fell. Kilter received him on his knee.\r\n\r\nHelmsgail was hardly touched: he had some insignificant bruises and a\r\nscratch on his collar bone.\r\n\r\nNo one was cold now. They laid sixteen and a quarter to one on\r\nHelmsgail.\r\n\r\nHarry Carleton cried out,--\r\n\r\n“It is all over with Phelem-ghe-Madone. I will lay my peerage of\r\nBella-aqua, and my title of Lord Bellew, against the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury’s old wig, on Helmsgail.”\r\n\r\n“Give me your muzzle,” said Kilter to Phelem-ghe-Madone. And stuffing\r\nthe bloody flannel into the bottle, he washed him all over with gin. The\r\nmouth reappeared, and he opened one eyelid. His temples seemed\r\nfractured.\r\n\r\n“One round more, my friend,” said Kilter; and he added, “for the honour\r\nof the low town.”\r\n\r\nThe Welsh and the Irish understand each other, still Phelem made no sign\r\nof having any power of understanding left.\r\n\r\nPhelem arose, supported by Kilter. It was the twenty-fifth round. From\r\nthe way in which this Cyclops, for he had but one eye, placed himself in\r\nposition, it was evident that this was the last round, for no one\r\ndoubted his defeat. He placed his guard below his chin, with the\r\nawkwardness of a failing man.\r\n\r\nHelmsgail, with a skin hardly sweating, cried out,--\r\n\r\n“I’ll back myself, a thousand to one.”\r\n\r\nHelmsgail, raising his arm, struck out; and, what was strange, both\r\nfell. A ghastly chuckle was heard. It was Phelem-ghe-Madone’s expression\r\nof delight. While receiving the terrible blow given him by Helmsgail on\r\nthe skull, he had given him a foul blow on the navel.\r\n\r\nHelmsgail, lying on his back, rattled in his throat.\r\n\r\nThe spectators looked at him as he lay on the ground, and said, “Paid\r\nback!” All clapped their hands, even those who had lost.\r\nPhelem-ghe-Madone had given foul blow for foul blow, and had only\r\nasserted his right.\r\n\r\nThey carried Helmsgail off on a hand-barrow. The opinion was that he\r\nwould not recover.\r\n\r\nLord Robartes exclaimed, “I win twelve hundred guineas.”\r\n\r\nPhelem-ghe-Madone was evidently maimed for life.\r\n\r\nAs she left, Josiana took the arm of Lord David, an act which was\r\ntolerated amongst people “engaged.” She said to him,--\r\n\r\n“It is very fine, but--”\r\n\r\n“But what?”\r\n\r\n“I thought it would have driven away my spleen. It has not.”\r\n\r\nLord David stopped, looked at Josiana, shut his mouth, and inflated his\r\ncheeks, whilst he nodded his head, which signified attention, and said\r\nto the duchess,--\r\n\r\n“For spleen there is but one remedy.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine.”\r\n\r\nThe duchess asked,--\r\n\r\n“And who is Gwynplaine?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE SECOND.\r\n\r\n_GWYNPLAINE AND DEA._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nWHEREIN WE SEE THE FACE OF HIM OF WHOM WE HAVE HITHERTO SEEN ONLY THE\r\nACTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature had been prodigal of her kindness to Gwynplaine. She had bestowed\r\non him a mouth opening to his ears, ears folding over to his eyes, a\r\nshapeless nose to support the spectacles of the grimace maker, and a\r\nface that no one could look upon without laughing.\r\n\r\nWe have just said that nature had loaded Gwynplaine with her gifts. But\r\nwas it nature? Had she not been assisted?\r\n\r\nTwo slits for eyes, a hiatus for a mouth, a snub protuberance with two\r\nholes for nostrils, a flattened face, all having for the result an\r\nappearance of laughter; it is certain that nature never produces such\r\nperfection single-handed.\r\n\r\nBut is laughter a synonym of joy?\r\n\r\nIf, in the presence of this mountebank--for he was one--the first\r\nimpression of gaiety wore off, and the man were observed with attention,\r\ntraces of art were to be recognized. Such a face could never have been\r\ncreated by chance; it must have resulted from intention. Such perfect\r\ncompleteness is not in nature. Man can do nothing to create beauty, but\r\neverything to produce ugliness. A Hottentot profile cannot be changed\r\ninto a Roman outline, but out of a Grecian nose you may make a\r\nCalmuck’s. It only requires to obliterate the root of the nose and to\r\nflatten the nostrils. The dog Latin of the Middle Ages had a reason for\r\nits creation of the verb _denasare_. Had Gwynplaine when a child been\r\nso worthy of attention that his face had been subjected to\r\ntransmutation? Why not? Needed there a greater motive than the\r\nspeculation of his future exhibition? According to all appearance,\r\nindustrious manipulators of children had worked upon his face. It seemed\r\nevident that a mysterious and probably occult science, which was to\r\nsurgery what alchemy was to chemistry, had chiselled his flesh,\r\nevidently at a very tender age, and manufactured his countenance with\r\npremeditation. That science, clever with the knife, skilled in obtusions\r\nand ligatures, had enlarged the mouth, cut away the lips, laid bare the\r\ngums, distended the ears, cut the cartilages, displaced the eyelids and\r\nthe cheeks, enlarged the zygomatic muscle, pressed the scars and\r\ncicatrices to a level, turned back the skin over the lesions whilst the\r\nface was thus stretched, from all which resulted that powerful and\r\nprofound piece of sculpture, the mask, Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nMan is not born thus.\r\n\r\nHowever it may have been, the manipulation of Gwynplaine had succeeded\r\nadmirably. Gwynplaine was a gift of Providence to dispel the sadness of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nOf what providence? Is there a providence of demons as well as of God?\r\nWe put the question without answering it.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine was a mountebank. He showed himself on the platform. No such\r\neffect had ever before been produced. Hypochondriacs were cured by the\r\nsight of him alone. He was avoided by folks in mourning, because they\r\nwere compelled to laugh when they saw him, without regard to their\r\ndecent gravity. One day the executioner came, and Gwynplaine made him\r\nlaugh. Every one who saw Gwynplaine held his sides; he spoke, and they\r\nrolled on the ground. He was removed from sadness as is pole from pole.\r\nSpleen at the one; Gwynplaine at the other.\r\n\r\nThus he rose rapidly in the fair ground and at the cross roads to the\r\nvery satisfactory renown of a horrible man.\r\n\r\nIt was Gwynplaine’s laugh which created the laughter of others, yet he\r\ndid not laugh himself. His face laughed; his thoughts did not. The\r\nextraordinary face which chance or a special and weird industry had\r\nfashioned for him, laughed alone. Gwynplaine had nothing to do with it.\r\nThe outside did not depend on the interior. The laugh which he had not\r\nplaced, himself, on his brow, on his eyelids, on his mouth, he could\r\nnot remove. It had been stamped for ever on his face. It was automatic,\r\nand the more irresistible because it seemed petrified. No one could\r\nescape from this rictus. Two convulsions of the face are infectious;\r\nlaughing and yawning. By virtue of the mysterious operation to which\r\nGwynplaine had probably been subjected in his infancy, every part of his\r\nface contributed to that rictus; his whole physiognomy led to that\r\nresult, as a wheel centres in the nave. All his emotions, whatever they\r\nmight have been, augmented his strange face of joy, or to speak more\r\ncorrectly, aggravated it. Any astonishment which might seize him, any\r\nsuffering which he might feel, any anger which might take possession of\r\nhim, any pity which might move him, would only increase this hilarity of\r\nhis muscles. If he wept, he laughed; and whatever Gwynplaine was,\r\nwhatever he wished to be, whatever he thought, the moment that he raised\r\nhis head, the crowd, if crowd there was, had before them one\r\nimpersonation: an overwhelming burst of laughter.\r\n\r\nIt was like a head of Medusa, but Medusa hilarious. All feeling or\r\nthought in the mind of the spectator was suddenly put to flight by the\r\nunexpected apparition, and laughter was inevitable. Antique art formerly\r\nplaced on the outsides of the Greek theatre a joyous brazen face, called\r\ncomedy. It laughed and occasioned laughter, but remained pensive. All\r\nparody which borders on folly, all irony which borders on wisdom, were\r\ncondensed and amalgamated in that face. The burden of care, of\r\ndisillusion, anxiety, and grief were expressed in its impassive\r\ncountenance, and resulted in a lugubrious sum of mirth. One corner of\r\nthe mouth was raised, in mockery of the human race; the other side, in\r\nblasphemy of the gods. Men confronted that model of the ideal sarcasm\r\nand exemplification of the irony which each one possesses within him;\r\nand the crowd, continually renewed round its fixed laugh, died away with\r\ndelight before its sepulchral immobility of mirth.\r\n\r\nOne might almost have said that Gwynplaine was that dark, dead mask of\r\nancient comedy adjusted to the body of a living man. That infernal head\r\nof implacable hilarity he supported on his neck. What a weight for the\r\nshoulders of a man--an everlasting laugh!\r\n\r\nAn everlasting laugh!\r\n\r\nLet us understand each other; we will explain. The Manichæans believed\r\nthe absolute occasionally gives way, and that God Himself sometimes\r\nabdicates for a time. So also of the will. We do not admit that it can\r\never be utterly powerless. The whole of existence resembles a letter\r\nmodified in the postscript. For Gwynplaine the postscript was this: by\r\nthe force of his will, and by concentrating all his attention, and on\r\ncondition that no emotion should come to distract and turn away the\r\nfixedness of his effort, he could manage to suspend the everlasting\r\nrictus of his face, and to throw over it a kind of tragic veil, and then\r\nthe spectator laughed no longer; he shuddered.\r\n\r\nThis exertion Gwynplaine scarcely ever made. It was a terrible effort,\r\nand an insupportable tension. Moreover, it happened that on the\r\nslightest distraction, or the slightest emotion, the laugh, driven back\r\nfor a moment, returned like a tide with an impulse which was\r\nirresistible in proportion to the force of the adverse emotion.\r\n\r\nWith this exception, Gwynplaine’s laugh was everlasting.\r\n\r\nOn seeing Gwynplaine, all laughed. When they had laughed they turned\r\naway their heads. Women especially shrank from him with horror. The man\r\nwas frightful. The joyous convulsion of laughter was as a tribute paid;\r\nthey submitted to it gladly, but almost mechanically. Besides, when once\r\nthe novelty of the laugh had passed over, Gwynplaine was intolerable for\r\na woman to see, and impossible to contemplate. But he was tall, well\r\nmade, and agile, and no way deformed, excepting in his face.\r\n\r\nThis led to the presumption that Gwynplaine was rather a creation of art\r\nthan a work of nature. Gwynplaine, beautiful in figure, had probably\r\nbeen beautiful in face. At his birth he had no doubt resembled other\r\ninfants. They had left the body intact, and retouched only the face.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine had been made to order--at least, that was probable. They had\r\nleft him his teeth; teeth are necessary to a laugh. The death’s head\r\nretains them. The operation performed on him must have been frightful.\r\nThat he had no remembrance of it was no proof that it had not taken\r\nplace. Surgical sculpture of the kind could never have succeeded except\r\non a very young child, and consequently on one having little\r\nconsciousness of what happened to him, and who might easily take a wound\r\nfor a sickness. Besides, we must remember that they had in those times\r\nmeans of putting patients to sleep, and of suppressing all suffering;\r\nonly then it was called magic, while now it is called anæsthesia.\r\n\r\nBesides this face, those who had brought him up had given him the\r\nresources of a gymnast and an athlete. His articulations usefully\r\ndisplaced and fashioned to bending the wrong way, had received the\r\neducation of a clown, and could, like the hinges of a door, move\r\nbackwards and forwards. In appropriating him to the profession of\r\nmountebank nothing had been neglected. His hair had been dyed with ochre\r\nonce for all; a secret which has been rediscovered at the present day.\r\nPretty women use it, and that which was formerly considered ugly is now\r\nconsidered an embellishment. Gwynplaine had yellow hair. His hair having\r\nprobably been dyed with some corrosive preparation, had left it woolly\r\nand rough to the touch. Its yellow bristles, rather a mane than a head\r\nof hair, covered and concealed a lofty brow, evidently made to contain\r\nthought. The operation, whatever it had been, which had deprived his\r\nfeatures of harmony, and put all their flesh into disorder, had had no\r\neffect on the bony structure of his head. The facial angle was powerful\r\nand surprisingly grand. Behind his laugh there was a soul, dreaming, as\r\nall our souls dream.\r\n\r\nHowever, his laugh was to Gwynplaine quite a talent. He could do nothing\r\nwith it, so he turned it to account. By means of it he gained his\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, as you have doubtless already guessed, was the child\r\nabandoned one winter evening on the coast of Portland, and received into\r\na poor caravan at Weymouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat boy was at this time a man. Fifteen years had elapsed. It was in\r\n1705. Gwynplaine was in his twenty-fifth year.\r\n\r\nUrsus had kept the two children with him. They were a group of\r\nwanderers. Ursus and Homo had aged. Ursus had become quite bald. The\r\nwolf was growing gray. The age of wolves is not ascertained like that of\r\ndogs. According to Molière, there are wolves which live to eighty,\r\namongst others the little koupara, and the rank wolf, the _Canis\r\nnubilus_ of Say.\r\n\r\nThe little girl found on the dead woman was now a tall creature of\r\nsixteen, with brown hair, slight, fragile, almost trembling from\r\ndelicacy, and almost inspiring fear lest she should break; admirably\r\nbeautiful, her eyes full of light, yet blind. That fatal winter night\r\nwhich threw down the beggar woman and her infant in the snow had struck\r\na double blow. It had killed the mother and blinded the child. Gutta\r\nserena had for ever paralysed the eyes of the girl, now become woman in\r\nher turn. On her face, through which the light of day never passed, the\r\ndepressed corners of the mouth indicated the bitterness of the\r\nprivation. Her eyes, large and clear, had a strange quality:\r\nextinguished for ever to her, to others they were brilliant. They were\r\nmysterious torches lighting only the outside. They gave light but\r\npossessed it not. These sightless eyes were resplendent. A captive of\r\nshadow, she lighted up the dull place she inhabited. From the depth of\r\nher incurable darkness, from behind the black wall called blindness, she\r\nflung her rays. She saw not the sun without, but her soul was\r\nperceptible from within.\r\n\r\nIn her dead look there was a celestial earnestness. She was the night,\r\nand from the irremediable darkness with which she was amalgamated she\r\ncame out a star.\r\n\r\nUrsus, with his mania for Latin names, had christened her Dea. He had\r\ntaken his wolf into consultation. He had said to him, “You represent\r\nman, I represent the beasts. We are of the lower world; this little one\r\nshall represent the world on high. Such feebleness is all-powerful. In\r\nthis manner the universe shall be complete in our hut in its three\r\norders--human, animal, and Divine.” The wolf made no objection.\r\nTherefore the foundling was called Dea.\r\n\r\nAs to Gwynplaine, Ursus had not had the trouble of inventing a name for\r\nhim. The morning of the day on which he had realized the disfigurement\r\nof the little boy and the blindness of the infant he had asked him,\r\n“Boy, what is your name?” and the boy had answered, “They call me\r\nGwynplaine.” “Be Gwynplaine, then,” said Ursus.\r\n\r\nDea assisted Gwynplaine in his performances. If human misery could be\r\nsummed up, it might have been summed up in Gwynplaine and Dea. Each\r\nseemed born in a compartment of the sepulchre; Gwynplaine in the\r\nhorrible, Dea in the darkness. Their existences were shadowed by two\r\ndifferent kinds of darkness, taken from the two formidable sides of\r\nnight. Dea had that shadow in her, Gwynplaine had it on him. There was a\r\nphantom in Dea, a spectre in Gwynplaine. Dea was sunk in the mournful,\r\nGwynplaine in something worse. There was for Gwynplaine, who could see,\r\na heartrending possibility that existed not for Dea, who was blind; he\r\ncould compare himself with other men. Now, in a situation such as that\r\nof Gwynplaine, admitting that he should seek to examine it, to compare\r\nhimself with others was to understand himself no more. To have, like\r\nDea, empty sight from which the world is absent, is a supreme distress,\r\nyet less than to be an enigma to oneself; to feel that something is\r\nwanting here as well, and that something, oneself; to see the universe\r\nand not to see oneself. Dea had a veil over her, the night; Gwynplaine a\r\nmask, his face. Inexpressible fact, it was by his own flesh that\r\nGwynplaine was masked! What his visage had been, he knew not. His face\r\nhad vanished. They had affixed to him a false self. He had for a face, a\r\ndisappearance. His head lived, his face was dead. He never remembered to\r\nhave seen it. Mankind was for Gwynplaine, as for Dea, an exterior fact.\r\nIt was far-off. She was alone, he was alone. The isolation of Dea was\r\nfunereal, she saw nothing; that of Gwynplaine sinister, he saw all\r\nthings. For Dea creation never passed the bounds of touch and hearing;\r\nreality was bounded, limited, short, immediately lost. Nothing was\r\ninfinite to her but darkness. For Gwynplaine to live was to have the\r\ncrowd for ever before him and outside him. Dea was the proscribed from\r\nlight, Gwynplaine the banned of life. They were beyond the pale of hope,\r\nand had reached the depth of possible calamity; they had sunk into it,\r\nboth of them. An observer who had watched them would have felt his\r\nreverie melt into immeasurable pity. What must they not have suffered!\r\nThe decree of misfortune weighed visibly on these human creatures, and\r\nnever had fate encompassed two beings who had done nothing to deserve\r\nit, and more clearly turned destiny into torture, and life into hell.\r\n\r\nThey were in a Paradise.\r\n\r\nThey were in love.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine adored Dea. Dea idolized Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\n“How beautiful you are!” she would say to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n“OCULOS NON HABET, ET VIDET.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly one woman on earth saw Gwynplaine. It was the blind girl. She had\r\nlearned what Gwynplaine had done for her, from Ursus, to whom he had\r\nrelated his rough journey from Portland to Weymouth, and the many\r\nsufferings which he had endured when deserted by the gang. She knew that\r\nwhen an infant dying upon her dead mother, suckling a corpse, a being\r\nscarcely bigger than herself had taken her up; that this being, exiled,\r\nand, as it were, buried under the refusal of the universe to aid him,\r\nhad heard her cry; that all the world being deaf to him, he had not been\r\ndeaf to her; that the child, alone, weak, cast off, without\r\nresting-place here below, dragging himself over the waste, exhausted by\r\nfatigue, crushed, had accepted from the hands of night a burden, another\r\nchild: that he, who had nothing to expect in that obscure distribution\r\nwhich we call fate, had charged himself with a destiny; that naked, in\r\nanguish and distress, he had made himself a Providence; that when Heaven\r\nhad closed he had opened his heart; that, himself lost, he had saved;\r\nthat having neither roof-tree nor shelter, he had been an asylum; that\r\nhe had made himself mother and nurse; that he who was alone in the world\r\nhad responded to desertion by adoption; that lost in the darkness he had\r\ngiven an example; that, as if not already sufficiently burdened, he had\r\nadded to his load another’s misery; that in this world, which seemed to\r\ncontain nothing for him, he had found a duty; that where every one else\r\nwould have hesitated, he had advanced; that where every one else would\r\nhave drawn back, he consented; that he had put his hand into the jaws of\r\nthe grave and drawn out her--Dea. That, himself half naked, he had given\r\nher his rags, because she was cold; that famished, he had thought of\r\ngiving her food and drink; that for one little creature, another little\r\ncreature had combated death; that he had fought it under every form;\r\nunder the form of winter and snow, under the form of solitude, under the\r\nform of terror, under the form of cold, hunger, and thirst, under the\r\nform of whirlwind, and that for her, Dea, this Titan of ten had given\r\nbattle to the immensity of night. She knew that as a child he had done\r\nthis, and that now as a man, he was strength to her weakness, riches to\r\nher poverty, healing to her sickness, and sight to her blindness.\r\nThrough the mist of the unknown by which she felt herself encompassed,\r\nshe distinguished clearly his devotion, his abnegation, his courage.\r\nHeroism in immaterial regions has an outline; she distinguished this\r\nsublime outline. In the inexpressible abstraction in which thought lives\r\nunlighted by the sun, Dea perceived this mysterious lineament of virtue.\r\nIn the surrounding of dark things put in motion, which was the only\r\nimpression made on her by reality; in the uneasy stagnation of a\r\ncreature, always passive, yet always on the watch for possible evil; in\r\nthe sensation of being ever defenceless, which is the life of the\r\nblind--she felt Gwynplaine above her; Gwynplaine never cold, never\r\nabsent, never obscured; Gwynplaine sympathetic, helpful, and\r\nsweet-tempered. Dea quivered with certainty and gratitude, her anxiety\r\nchanged into ecstasy, and with her shadowy eyes she contemplated on the\r\nzenith from the depth of her abyss the rich light of his goodness. In\r\nthe ideal, kindness is the sun; and Gwynplaine dazzled Dea.\r\n\r\nTo the crowd, which has too many heads to have a thought, and too many\r\neyes to have a sight--to the crowd who, superficial themselves, judge\r\nonly of the surface, Gwynplaine was a clown, a merry-andrew, a\r\nmountebank, a creature grotesque, a little more and a little less than a\r\nbeast. The crowd knew only the face.\r\n\r\nFor Dea, Gwynplaine was the saviour, who had gathered her into his arms\r\nin the tomb, and borne her out of it; the consoler, who made life\r\ntolerable; the liberator, whose hand, holding her own, guided her\r\nthrough that labyrinth called blindness. Gwynplaine was her brother,\r\nfriend, guide, support; the personification of heavenly power; the\r\nhusband, winged and resplendent. Where the multitude saw the monster,\r\nDea recognized the archangel. It was that Dea, blind, perceived his\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nWELL-MATCHED LOVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUrsus being a philosopher understood. He approved of the fascination of\r\nDea. He said, The blind see the invisible. He said, Conscience is\r\nvision. Then, looking at Gwynplaine, he murmured, Semi-monster, but\r\ndemi-god.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, on the other hand, was madly in love with Dea.\r\n\r\nThere is the invisible eye, the spirit, and the visible eye, the pupil.\r\nHe saw her with the visible eye. Dea was dazzled by the ideal;\r\nGwynplaine, by the real. Gwynplaine was not ugly; he was frightful. He\r\nsaw his contrast before him: in proportion as he was terrible, Dea was\r\nsweet. He was horror; she was grace. Dea was his dream. She seemed a\r\nvision scarcely embodied. There was in her whole person, in her Grecian\r\nform, in her fine and supple figure, swaying like a reed; in her\r\nshoulders, on which might have been invisible wings; in the modest\r\ncurves which indicated her sex, to the soul rather than to the senses;\r\nin her fairness, which amounted almost to transparency; in the august\r\nand reserved serenity of her look, divinely shut out from earth; in the\r\nsacred innocence of her smile--she was almost an angel, and yet just a\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, we have said, compared himself and compared Dea.\r\n\r\nHis existence, such as it was, was the result of a double and unheard-of\r\nchoice. It was the point of intersection of two rays--one from below and\r\none from above--a black and a white ray. To the same crumb, perhaps\r\npecked at at once by the beaks of evil and good, one gave the bite, the\r\nother the kiss. Gwynplaine was this crumb--an atom, wounded and\r\ncaressed. Gwynplaine was the product of fatality combined with\r\nProvidence. Misfortune had placed its finger on him; happiness as well.\r\nTwo extreme destinies composed his strange lot. He had on him an\r\nanathema and a benediction. He was the elect, cursed. Who was he? He\r\nknew not. When he looked at himself, he saw one he knew not; but this\r\nunknown was a monster. Gwynplaine lived as it were beheaded, with a face\r\nwhich did not belong to him. This face was frightful, so frightful that\r\nit was absurd. It caused as much fear as laughter. It was a\r\nhell-concocted absurdity. It was the shipwreck of a human face into the\r\nmask of an animal. Never had been seen so total an eclipse of humanity\r\nin a human face; never parody more complete; never had apparition more\r\nfrightful grinned in nightmare; never had everything repulsive to woman\r\nbeen more hideously amalgamated in a man. The unfortunate heart, masked\r\nand calumniated by the face, seemed for ever condemned to solitude under\r\nit, as under a tombstone.\r\n\r\nYet no! Where unknown malice had done its worst, invisible goodness had\r\nlent its aid. In the poor fallen one, suddenly raised up, by the side of\r\nthe repulsive, it had placed the attractive; on the barren shoal it had\r\nset the loadstone; it had caused a soul to fly with swift wings towards\r\nthe deserted one; it had sent the dove to console the creature whom the\r\nthunderbolt had overwhelmed, and had made beauty adore deformity. For\r\nthis to be possible it was necessary that beauty should not see the\r\ndisfigurement. For this good fortune, misfortune was required.\r\nProvidence had made Dea blind.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine vaguely felt himself the object of a redemption. Why had he\r\nbeen persecuted? He knew not. Why redeemed? He knew not. All he knew was\r\nthat a halo had encircled his brand. When Gwynplaine had been old enough\r\nto understand, Ursus had read and explained to him the text of Doctor\r\nConquest _de Denasatis_, and in another folio, Hugo Plagon, the passage,\r\n_Naves habensmutilas_; but Ursus had prudently abstained from\r\n“hypotheses,” and had been reserved in his opinion of what it might\r\nmean. Suppositions were possible. The probability of violence inflicted\r\non Gwynplaine when an infant was hinted at, but for Gwynplaine the\r\nresult was the only evidence. His destiny was to live under a stigma.\r\nWhy this stigma? There was no answer.\r\n\r\nSilence and solitude were around Gwynplaine. All was uncertain in the\r\nconjectures which could be fitted to the tragical reality; excepting the\r\nterrible fact, nothing was certain. In his discouragement Dea intervened\r\na sort of celestial interposition between him and despair. He perceived,\r\nmelted and inspirited by the sweetness of the beautiful girl who turned\r\nto him, that, horrible as he was, a beautified wonder affected his\r\nmonstrous visage. Having been fashioned to create dread, he was the\r\nobject of a miraculous exception, that it was admired and adored in the\r\nideal by the light; and, monster that he was, he felt himself the\r\ncontemplation of a star.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine and Dea were united, and these two suffering hearts adored\r\neach other. One nest and two birds--that was their story. They had\r\nbegun to feel a universal law--to please, to seek, and to find each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThus hatred had made a mistake. The persecutors of Gwynplaine, whoever\r\nthey might have been--the deadly enigma, from wherever it came--had\r\nmissed their aim. They had intended to drive him to desperation; they\r\nhad succeeded in driving him into enchantment. They had affianced him\r\nbeforehand to a healing wound. They had predestined him for consolation\r\nby an infliction. The pincers of the executioner had softly\r\nchanged into the delicately-moulded hand of a girl. Gwynplaine was\r\nhorrible--artificially horrible--made horrible by the hand of man. They\r\nhad hoped to exile him for ever: first, from his family, if his family\r\nexisted, and then from humanity. When an infant, they had made him a\r\nruin; of this ruin Nature had repossessed herself, as she does of all\r\nruins. This solitude Nature had consoled, as she consoles all solitudes.\r\nNature comes to the succour of the deserted; where all is lacking, she\r\ngives back her whole self. She flourishes and grows green amid ruins;\r\nshe has ivy for the stones and love for man.\r\n\r\nProfound generosity of the shadows!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE BLUE SKY THROUGH THE BLACK CLOUD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus lived these unfortunate creatures together--Dea, relying;\r\nGwynplaine, accepted. These orphans were all in all to each other, the\r\nfeeble and the deformed. The widowed were betrothed. An inexpressible\r\nthanksgiving arose out of their distress. They were grateful. To whom?\r\nTo the obscure immensity. Be grateful in your own hearts. That suffices.\r\nThanksgiving has wings, and flies to its right destination. Your prayer\r\nknows its way better than you can.\r\n\r\nHow many men have believed that they prayed to Jupiter, when they prayed\r\nto Jehovah! How many believers in amulets are listened to by the\r\nAlmighty! How many atheists there are who know not that, in the simple\r\nfact of being good and sad, they pray to God!\r\n\r\nGwynplaine and Dea were grateful. Deformity is expulsion. Blindness is a\r\nprecipice. The expelled one had been adopted; the precipice was\r\nhabitable.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine had seen a brilliant light descending on him, in an\r\narrangement of destiny which seemed to put, in the perspective of a\r\ndream, a white cloud of beauty having the form of a woman, a radiant\r\nvision in which there was a heart; and the phantom, almost a cloud and\r\nyet a woman, clasped him; and the apparition embraced him; and the heart\r\ndesired him. Gwynplaine was no longer deformed. He was beloved. The rose\r\ndemanded the caterpillar in marriage, feeling that within the\r\ncaterpillar there was a divine butterfly. Gwynplaine the rejected was\r\nchosen. To have one’s desire is everything. Gwynplaine had his, Dea\r\nhers.\r\n\r\nThe abjection of the disfigured man was exalted and dilated into\r\nintoxication, into delight, into belief; and a hand was stretched out\r\ntowards the melancholy hesitation of the blind girl, to guide her in her\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nIt was the penetration of two misfortunes into the ideal which absorbed\r\nthem. The rejected found a refuge in each other. Two blanks, combining,\r\nfilled each other up. They held together by what they lacked: in that in\r\nwhich one was poor, the other was rich. The misfortune of the one made\r\nthe treasure of the other. Had Dea not been blind, would she have chosen\r\nGwynplaine? Had Gwynplaine not been disfigured, would he have preferred\r\nDea? She would probably have rejected the deformed, as he would have\r\npassed by the infirm. What happiness for Dea that Gwynplaine was\r\nhideous! What good fortune for Gwynplaine that Dea was blind! Apart from\r\ntheir providential matching, they were impossible to each other. A\r\nmighty want of each other was at the bottom of their loves, Gwynplaine\r\nsaved Dea. Dea saved Gwynplaine. Apposition of misery produced\r\nadherence. It was the embrace of those swallowed in the abyss; none\r\ncloser, none more hopeless, none more exquisite.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine had a thought--“What should I be without her?” Dea had a\r\nthought--“What should I be without him?” The exile of each made a\r\ncountry for both. The two incurable fatalities, the stigmata of\r\nGwynplaine and the blindness of Dea, joined them together in\r\ncontentment. They sufficed to each other. They imagined nothing beyond\r\neach other. To speak to one another was a delight, to approach was\r\nbeatitude; by force of reciprocal intuition they became united in the\r\nsame reverie, and thought the same thoughts. In Gwynplaine’s tread Dea\r\nbelieved that she heard the step of one deified. They tightened their\r\nmutual grasp in a sort of sidereal _chiaroscuro_, full of perfumes, of\r\ngleams, of music, of the luminous architecture of dreams. They belonged\r\nto each other; they knew themselves to be for ever united in the same\r\njoy and the same ecstasy; and nothing could be stranger than this\r\nconstruction of an Eden by two of the damned.\r\n\r\nThey were inexpressibly happy. In their hell they had created heaven.\r\nSuch was thy power, O Love! Dea heard Gwynplaine’s laugh; Gwynplaine saw\r\nDea’s smile. Thus ideal felicity was found, the perfect joy of life was\r\nrealized, the mysterious problem of happiness was solved; and by whom?\r\nBy two outcasts.\r\n\r\nFor Gwynplaine, Dea was splendour. For Dea, Gwynplaine was presence.\r\nPresence is that profound mystery which renders the invisible world\r\ndivine, and from which results that other mystery--confidence. In\r\nreligions this is the only thing which is irreducible; but this\r\nirreducible thing suffices. The great motive power is not seen; it is\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine was the religion of Dea. Sometimes, lost in her sense of love\r\ntowards him, she knelt, like a beautiful priestess before a gnome in a\r\npagoda, made happy by her adoration.\r\n\r\nImagine to yourself an abyss, and in its centre an oasis of light, and\r\nin this oasis two creatures shut out of life, dazzling each other. No\r\npurity could be compared to their loves. Dea was ignorant what a kiss\r\nmight be, though perhaps she desired it; because blindness, especially\r\nin a woman, has its dreams, and though trembling at the approaches of\r\nthe unknown, does not fear them all. As to Gwynplaine, his sensitive\r\nyouth made him pensive. The more delirious he felt, the more timid he\r\nbecame. He might have dared anything with this companion of his early\r\nyouth, with this creature as innocent of fault as of the light, with\r\nthis blind girl who saw but one thing--that she adored him! But he would\r\nhave thought it a theft to take what she might have given; so he\r\nresigned himself with a melancholy satisfaction to love angelically, and\r\nthe conviction of his deformity resolved itself into a proud purity.\r\n\r\nThese happy creatures dwelt in the ideal. They were spouses in it at\r\ndistances as opposite as the spheres. They exchanged in its firmament\r\nthe deep effluvium which is in infinity attraction, and on earth the\r\nsexes. Their kisses were the kisses of souls.\r\n\r\nThey had always lived a common life. They knew themselves only in each\r\nother’s society. The infancy of Dea had coincided with the youth of\r\nGwynplaine. They had grown up side by side. For a long time they had\r\nslept in the same bed, for the hut was not a large bedchamber. They lay\r\non the chest, Ursus on the floor; that was the arrangement. One fine\r\nday, whilst Dea was still very little, Gwynplaine felt himself grown up,\r\nand it was in the youth that shame arose. He said to Ursus, “I will also\r\nsleep on the floor.” And at night he stretched himself, with the old\r\nman, on the bear skin. Then Dea wept. She cried for her bed-fellow; but\r\nGwynplaine, become restless because he had begun to love, decided to\r\nremain where he was. From that time he always slept by the side of Ursus\r\non the planks. In the summer, when the nights were fine, he slept\r\noutside with Homo.\r\n\r\nWhen thirteen, Dea had not yet become resigned to the arrangement. Often\r\nin the evening she said, “Gwynplaine, come close to me; that will put me\r\nto sleep.” A man lying by her side was a necessity to her innocent\r\nslumbers.\r\n\r\nNudity is to see that one is naked. She ignored nudity. It was the\r\ningenuousness of Arcadia or Otaheite. Dea untaught made Gwynplaine wild.\r\nSometimes it happened that Dea, when almost reaching youth, combed her\r\nlong hair as she sat on her bed--her chemise unfastened and falling off\r\nrevealed indications of a feminine outline, and a vague commencement of\r\nEve--and would call Gwynplaine. Gwynplaine blushed, lowered his eyes,\r\nand knew not what to do in presence of this innocent creature.\r\nStammering, he turned his head, feared, and fled. The Daphnis of\r\ndarkness took flight before the Chloe of shadow.\r\n\r\nSuch was the idyll blooming in a tragedy.\r\n\r\nUrsus said to them,--“Old brutes, adore each other!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nURSUS AS TUTOR, AND URSUS AS GUARDIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nUrsus added,--\r\n\r\n“Some of these days I will play them a nasty trick. I will marry them.”\r\n\r\nUrsus taught Gwynplaine the theory of love. He said to him,--\r\n\r\n“Do you know how the Almighty lights the fire called love? He places\r\nthe woman underneath, the devil between, and the man at the top. A\r\nmatch--that is to say, a look--and behold, it is all on fire.”\r\n\r\n“A look is unnecessary,” answered Gwynplaine, thinking of Dea.\r\n\r\nAnd Ursus replied,--\r\n\r\n“Booby! Do souls require mortal eyes to see each other?”\r\n\r\nUrsus was a good fellow at times. Gwynplaine, sometimes madly in love\r\nwith Dea, became melancholy, and made use of the presence of Ursus as a\r\nguard on himself. One day Ursus said to him,--\r\n\r\n“Bah! do not put yourself out. When in love, the cock shows himself.”\r\n\r\n“But the eagle conceals himself,” replied Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nAt other times Ursus would say to himself, apart,--\r\n\r\n“It is wise to put spokes in the wheels of the Cytherean car. They love\r\neach other too much. This may have its disadvantages. Let us avoid a\r\nfire. Let us moderate these hearts.”\r\n\r\nThen Ursus had recourse to warnings of this nature, speaking to\r\nGwynplaine when Dea slept, and to Dea when Gwynplaine’s back was\r\nturned:--\r\n\r\n“Dea, you must not be so fond of Gwynplaine. To live in the life of\r\nanother is perilous. Egoism is a good root of happiness. Men escape from\r\nwomen. And then Gwynplaine might end by becoming infatuated with you.\r\nHis success is so great! You have no idea how great his success is!”\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine, disproportions are no good. So much ugliness on one side\r\nand so much beauty on another ought to compel reflection. Temper your\r\nardour, my boy. Do not become too enthusiastic about Dea. Do you\r\nseriously consider that you are made for her? Just think of your\r\ndeformity and her perfection! See the distance between her and yourself.\r\nShe has everything, this Dea. What a white skin! What hair! Lips like\r\nstrawberries! And her foot! her hand! Those shoulders, with their\r\nexquisite curve! Her expression is sublime. She walks diffusing light;\r\nand in speaking, the grave tone of her voice is charming. But for all\r\nthis, to think that she is a woman! She would not be such a fool as to\r\nbe an angel. She is absolute beauty. Repeat all this to yourself, to\r\ncalm your ardour.”\r\n\r\nThese speeches redoubled the love of Gwynplaine and Dea, and Ursus was\r\nastonished at his want of success, just as one who should say, “It is\r\nsingular that with all the oil I throw on fire I cannot extinguish it.”\r\n\r\nDid he, then, desire to extinguish their love, or to cool it even?\r\n\r\nCertainly not. He would have been well punished had he succeeded. At the\r\nbottom of his heart this love, which was flame for them and warmth for\r\nhim, was his delight.\r\n\r\nBut it is natural to grate a little against that which charms us; men\r\ncall it wisdom.\r\n\r\nUrsus had been, in his relations with Gwynplaine and Dea, almost a\r\nfather and a mother. Grumbling all the while, he had brought them up;\r\ngrumbling all the while, he had nourished them. His adoption of them had\r\nmade the hut roll more heavily, and he had been oftener compelled to\r\nharness himself by Homo’s side to help to draw it.\r\n\r\nWe may observe, however, that after the first few years, when Gwynplaine\r\nwas nearly grown up, and Ursus had grown quite old, Gwynplaine had taken\r\nhis turn, and drawn Ursus.\r\n\r\nUrsus, seeing that Gwynplaine was becoming a man, had cast the horoscope\r\nof his deformity. “_It has made your fortune!_” he had told him.\r\n\r\nThis family of an old man and two children, with a wolf, had become, as\r\nthey wandered, a group more and more intimately united. There errant\r\nlife had not hindered education. “To wander is to grow,” Ursus said.\r\nGwynplaine was evidently made to exhibit at fairs. Ursus had cultivated\r\nin him feats of dexterity, and had encrusted him as much as possible\r\nwith all he himself possessed of science and wisdom.\r\n\r\nUrsus, contemplating the perplexing mask of Gwynplaine’s face, often\r\ngrowled,--\r\n\r\n“He has begun well.” It was for this reason that he had perfected him\r\nwith every ornament of philosophy and wisdom.\r\n\r\nHe repeated constantly to Gwynplaine,--\r\n\r\n“Be a philosopher. To be wise is to be invulnerable. You see what I am,\r\nI have never shed a tears. This is the result of my wisdom. Do you think\r\nthat occasion for tears has been wanting, had I felt disposed to weep?”\r\n\r\nUrsus, in one of his monologues in the hearing of the wolf, said,--\r\n\r\n“I have taught Gwynplaine everything, Latin included. I have taught Dea\r\nnothing, music included.”\r\n\r\nHe had taught them both to sing. He had himself a pretty talent for\r\nplaying on the oaten reed, a little flute of that period. He played on\r\nit agreeably, as also on the _chiffonie_, a sort of beggar’s\r\nhurdy-gurdy, mentioned in the Chronicle of Bertrand Duguesclin as the\r\n“truant instrument,” which started the symphony. These instruments\r\nattracted the crowd. Ursus would show them the chiffonie, and say, “It\r\nis called organistrum in Latin.”\r\n\r\nHe had taught Dea and Gwynplaine to sing, according to the method of\r\nOrpheus and of Egide Binchois. Frequently he interrupted the lessons\r\nwith cries of enthusiasm, such as “Orpheus, musician of Greece!\r\nBinchois, musician of Picardy!”\r\n\r\nThese branches of careful culture did not occupy the children so as to\r\nprevent their adoring each other. They had mingled their hearts together\r\nas they grew up, as two saplings planted near mingle their branches as\r\nthey become trees.\r\n\r\n“No matter,” said Ursus. “I will marry them.”\r\n\r\nThen he grumbled to himself,--\r\n\r\n“They are quite tiresome with their love.”\r\n\r\nThe past--their little past, at least--had no existence for Dea and\r\nGwynplaine. They knew only what Ursus had told them of it. They called\r\nUrsus father. The only remembrance which Gwynplaine had of his infancy\r\nwas as of a passage of demons over his cradle. He had an impression of\r\nhaving been trodden in the darkness under deformed feet. Was this\r\nintentional or not? He was ignorant on this point. That which he\r\nremembered clearly and to the slightest detail were his tragical\r\nadventures when deserted at Portland. The finding of Dea made that\r\ndismal night a radiant date for him.\r\n\r\nThe memory of Dea, even more than that of Gwynplaine, was lost in\r\nclouds. In so young a child all remembrance melts away. She recollected\r\nher mother as something cold. Had she ever seen the sun? Perhaps so. She\r\nmade efforts to pierce into the blank which was her past life.\r\n\r\n“The sun!--what was it?”\r\n\r\nShe had some vague memory of a thing luminous and warm, of which\r\nGwynplaine had taken the place.\r\n\r\nThey spoke to each other in low tones. It is certain that cooing is the\r\nmost important thing in the world. Dea often said to Gwynplaine,--\r\n\r\n“Light means that you are speaking.”\r\n\r\nOnce, no longer containing himself, as he saw through a muslin sleeve\r\nthe arm of Dea, Gwynplaine brushed its transparency with his lips--ideal\r\nkiss of a deformed mouth! Dea felt a deep delight; she blushed like a\r\nrose. This kiss from a monster made Aurora gleam on that beautiful brow\r\nfull of night. However, Gwynplaine sighed with a kind of terror, and as\r\nthe neckerchief of Dea gaped, he could not refrain from looking at the\r\nwhiteness visible through that glimpse of Paradise.\r\n\r\nDea pulled up her sleeve, and stretching towards Gwynplaine her naked\r\narm, said,--\r\n\r\n“Again!”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine fled.\r\n\r\nThe next day the game was renewed, with variations.\r\n\r\nIt was a heavenly subsidence into that sweet abyss called love.\r\n\r\nAt such things heaven smiles philosophically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nBLINDNESS GIVES LESSONS IN CLAIRVOYANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt times Gwynplaine reproached himself. He made his happiness a case of\r\nconscience. He fancied that to allow a woman who could not see him to\r\nlove him was to deceive her.\r\n\r\nWhat would she have said could she have suddenly obtained her sight? How\r\nshe would have felt repulsed by what had previously attracted her! How\r\nshe would have recoiled from her frightful loadstone! What a cry! What\r\ncovering of her face! What a flight! A bitter scruple harassed him. He\r\ntold himself that such a monster as he had no right to love. He was a\r\nhydra idolized by a star. It was his duty to enlighten the blind star.\r\n\r\nOne day he said to Dea,--\r\n\r\n“You know that I am very ugly.”\r\n\r\n“I know that you are sublime,” she answered.\r\n\r\nHe resumed,--\r\n\r\n“When you hear all the world laugh, they laugh at me because I am\r\nhorrible.”\r\n\r\n“I love you,” said Dea.\r\n\r\nAfter a silence, she added,--\r\n\r\n“I was in death; you brought me to life. When you are here, heaven is by\r\nmy side. Give me your hand, that I may touch heaven.”\r\n\r\nTheir hands met and grasped each other. They spoke no more, but were\r\nsilent in the plenitude of love.\r\n\r\nUrsus, who was crabbed, had overheard this. The next day, when the three\r\nwere together, he said,--\r\n\r\n“For that matter, Dea is ugly also.”\r\n\r\nThe word produced no effect. Dea and Gwynplaine were not listening.\r\nAbsorbed in each other, they rarely heeded such exclamations of Ursus.\r\nTheir depth was a dead loss.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, the precaution of Ursus, “Dea is also ugly,”\r\nindicated in this learned man a certain knowledge of women. It is\r\ncertain that Gwynplaine, in his loyalty, had been guilty of an\r\nimprudence. To have said, _I am ugly_, to any other blind girl than Dea\r\nmight have been dangerous. To be blind, and in love, is to be twofold\r\nblind. In such a situation dreams are dreamt. Illusion is the food of\r\ndreams. Take illusion from love, and you take from it its aliment. It is\r\ncompounded of every enthusiasm, of both physical and moral admiration.\r\n\r\nMoreover, you should never tell a woman a word difficult to understand.\r\nShe will dream about it, and she often dreams falsely. An enigma in a\r\nreverie spoils it. The shock caused by the fall of a careless word\r\ndisplaces that against which it strikes. At times it happens, without\r\nour knowing why, that because we have received the obscure blow of a\r\nchance word the heart empties itself insensibly of love. He who loves\r\nperceives a decline in his happiness. Nothing is to be feared more than\r\nthis slow exudation from the fissure in the vase.\r\n\r\nHappily, Dea was not formed of such clay. The stuff of which other women\r\nare made had not been used in her construction. She had a rare nature.\r\nThe frame, but not the heart, was fragile. A divine perseverance in love\r\nwas in the heart of her being.\r\n\r\nThe whole disturbance which the word used by Gwynplaine had produced in\r\nher ended in her saying one day,--\r\n\r\n“To be ugly--what is it? It is to do wrong. Gwynplaine only does good.\r\nHe is handsome.”\r\n\r\nThen, under the form of interrogation so familiar to children and to\r\nthe blind, she resumed,--\r\n\r\n“To see--what is it that you call seeing? For my own part, I cannot see;\r\nI know. It seems that _to see_ means to hide.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” said Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nDea answered,--\r\n\r\n“To see is a thing which conceals the true.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\n“But yes,” replied Dea, “since you say you are ugly.”\r\n\r\nShe reflected a moment, and then said, “Story-teller!”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine felt the joy of having confessed and of not being believed.\r\nBoth his conscience and his love were consoled.\r\n\r\nThus they had reached, Dea sixteen, Gwynplaine nearly twenty-five. They\r\nwere not, as it would now be expressed, “more advanced” than the first\r\nday. Less even; for it may be remembered that on their wedding night she\r\nwas nine months and he ten years old. A sort of holy childhood had\r\ncontinued in their love. Thus it sometimes happens that the belated\r\nnightingale prolongs her nocturnal song till dawn.\r\n\r\nTheir caresses went no further than pressing hands, or lips brushing a\r\nnaked arm. Soft, half-articulate whispers sufficed them.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four and sixteen! So it happened that Ursus, who did not lose\r\nsight of the ill turn he intended to do them, said,--\r\n\r\n“One of these days you must choose a religion.”\r\n\r\n“Wherefore?” inquired Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\n“That you may marry.”\r\n\r\n“That is already done,” said Dea.\r\n\r\nDea did not understand that they could be more man and wife than they\r\nwere already.\r\n\r\nAt bottom, this chimerical and virginal content, this innocent union of\r\nsouls, this celibacy taken for marriage, was not displeasing to Ursus.\r\n\r\nBesides, were they not already married? If the indissoluble existed\r\nanywhere, was it not in their union? Gwynplaine and Dea! They were\r\ncreatures worthy of the love they mutually felt, flung by misfortune\r\ninto each other’s arms. And as if they were not enough in this first\r\nlink, love had survened on misfortune, and had attached them, united\r\nand bound them together. What power could ever break that iron chain,\r\nbound with knots of flowers? They were indeed bound together.\r\n\r\nDea had beauty, Gwynplaine had sight. Each brought a dowry. They were\r\nmore than coupled--they were paired: separated solely by the sacred\r\ninterposition of innocence.\r\n\r\nThough dream as Gwynplaine would, however, and absorb all meaner\r\npassions as he could in the contemplation of Dea and before the tribunal\r\nof conscience, he was a man. Fatal laws are not to be eluded. He\r\nunderwent, like everything else in nature, the obscure fermentations\r\nwilled by the Creator. At times, therefore, he looked at the women who\r\nwere in the crowd, but he immediately felt that the look was a sin, and\r\nhastened to retire, repentant, into his own soul.\r\n\r\nLet us add that he met with no encouragement. On the face of every woman\r\nwho looked upon him he saw aversion antipathy, repugnance, and\r\nrejection. It was clear that no other than Dea was possible for him.\r\nThis aided his repentance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nNOT ONLY HAPPINESS, BUT PROSPERITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat true things are told in stories! The burnt scar of the invisible\r\nfiend who has touched you is remorse for a wicked thought. In Gwynplaine\r\nevil thoughts never ripened, and he had therefore no remorse. Sometimes\r\nhe felt regret.\r\n\r\nVague mists of conscience.\r\n\r\nWhat was this?\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nTheir happiness was complete--so complete that they were no longer even\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nFrom 1680 to 1704 a great change had taken place.\r\n\r\nIt happened sometimes, in the year 1704, that as night fell on some\r\nlittle village on the coast, a great, heavy van, drawn by a pair of\r\nstout horses, made its entry. It was like the shell of a vessel\r\nreversed--the keel for a roof, the deck for a floor, placed on four\r\nwheels. The wheels were all of the same size, and high as wagon wheels.\r\nWheels, pole, and van were all painted green, with a rhythmical\r\ngradation of shades, which ranged from bottle green for the wheels to\r\napple green for the roofing. This green colour had succeeded in drawing\r\nattention to the carriage, which was known in all the fair grounds as\r\nThe Green Box. The Green Box had but two windows, one at each extremity,\r\nand at the back a door with steps to let down. On the roof, from a tube\r\npainted green like the rest, smoke arose. This moving house was always\r\nvarnished and washed afresh. In front, on a ledge fastened to the van,\r\nwith the window for a door, behind the horses and by the side of an old\r\nman who held the reins and directed the team, two gipsy women, dressed\r\nas goddesses, sounded their trumpets. The astonishment with which the\r\nvillagers regarded this machine was overwhelming.\r\n\r\nThis was the old establishment of Ursus, its proportions augmented by\r\nsuccess, and improved from a wretched booth into a theatre. A kind of\r\nanimal, between dog and wolf, was chained under the van. This was Homo.\r\nThe old coachman who drove the horses was the philosopher himself.\r\n\r\nWhence came this improvement from the miserable hut to the Olympic\r\ncaravan?\r\n\r\nFrom this--Gwynplaine had become famous.\r\n\r\nIt was with a correct scent of what would succeed amongst men that Ursus\r\nhad said to Gwynplaine,--\r\n\r\n“They made your fortune.”\r\n\r\nUrsus, it may be remembered, had made Gwynplaine his pupil. Unknown\r\npeople had worked upon his face; he, on the other hand, had worked on\r\nhis mind, and behind this well-executed mask he had placed all that he\r\ncould of thought. So soon as the growth of the child had rendered him\r\nfitted for it, he had brought him out on the stage--that is, he had\r\nproduced him in front of the van.\r\n\r\nThe effect of his appearance had been surprising. The passers-by were\r\nimmediately struck with wonder. Never had anything been seen to be\r\ncompared to this extraordinary mimic of laughter. They were ignorant how\r\nthe miracle of infectious hilarity had been obtained. Some believed it\r\nto be natural, others declared it to be artificial, and as conjecture\r\nwas added to reality, everywhere, at every cross-road on the journey, in\r\nall the grounds of fairs and fêtes, the crowd ran after Gwynplaine.\r\nThanks to this great attraction, there had come into the poor purse of\r\nthe wandering group, first a rain of farthings, then of heavy pennies,\r\nand finally of shillings. The curiosity of one place exhausted, they\r\npassed on to another. Rolling does not enrich a stone but it enriches a\r\ncaravan; and year by year, from city to city, with the increased growth\r\nof Gwynplaine’s person and of his ugliness, the fortune predicted by\r\nUrsus had come.\r\n\r\n“What a good turn they did you there, my boy!” said Ursus.\r\n\r\nThis “fortune” had allowed Ursus, who was the administrator of\r\nGwynplaine’s success, to have the chariot of his dreams\r\nconstructed--that is to say, a caravan large enough to carry a theatre,\r\nand to sow science and art in the highways. Moreover, Ursus had been\r\nable to add to the group composed of himself, Homo, Gwynplaine, and Dea,\r\ntwo horses and two women, who were the goddesses of the troupe, as we\r\nhave just said, and its servants. A mythological frontispiece was, in\r\nthose days, of service to a caravan of mountebanks.\r\n\r\n“We are a wandering temple,” said Ursus.\r\n\r\nThese two gipsies, picked up by the philosopher from amongst the\r\nvagabondage of cities and suburbs, were ugly and young, and were called,\r\nby order of Ursus, the one Phoebe, and the other Venus.\r\n\r\nFor these read Fibi and Vinos, that we may conform to English\r\npronunciation.\r\n\r\nPhoebe cooked; Venus scrubbed the temple.\r\n\r\nMoreover, on days of performance they dressed Dea.\r\n\r\nMountebanks have their public life as well as princes, and on these\r\noccasions Dea was arrayed, like Fibi and Vinos, in a Florentine\r\npetticoat of flowered stuff, and a woman’s jacket without sleeves,\r\nleaving the arms bare. Ursus and Gwynplaine wore men’s jackets, and,\r\nlike sailors on board a man-of-war, great loose trousers. Gwynplaine\r\nhad, besides, for his work and for his feats of strength, round his neck\r\nand over his shoulders, an esclavine of leather. He took charge of the\r\nhorses. Ursus and Homo took charge of each other.\r\n\r\nDea, being used to the Green Box, came and went in the interior of the\r\nwheeled house, with almost as much ease and certainty as those who saw.\r\n\r\nThe eye which could penetrate within this structure and its internal\r\narrangements might have perceived in a corner, fastened to the planks,\r\nand immovable on its four wheels, the old hut of Ursus, placed on\r\nhalf-pay, allowed to rust, and from thenceforth dispensed the labour of\r\nrolling as Ursus was relieved from the labour of drawing it.\r\n\r\nThis hut, in a corner at the back, to the right of the door, served as\r\nbedchamber and dressing-room to Ursus and Gwynplaine. It now contained\r\ntwo beds. In the opposite corner was the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of a vessel was not more precise and concise than that\r\nof the interior of the Green Box. Everything within it was in its\r\nplace--arranged, foreseen, and intended.\r\n\r\nThe caravan was divided into three compartments, partitioned from each\r\nother. These communicated by open spaces without doors. A piece of stuff\r\nfell over them, and answered the purpose of concealment. The compartment\r\nbehind belonged to the men, the compartment in front to the women; the\r\ncompartment in the middle, separating the two sexes, was the stage. The\r\ninstruments of the orchestra and the properties were kept in the\r\nkitchen. A loft under the arch of the roof contained the scenes, and on\r\nopening a trap-door lamps appeared, producing wonders of light.\r\n\r\nUrsus was the poet of these magical representations; he wrote the\r\npieces. He had a diversity of talents; he was clever at sleight of hand.\r\nBesides the voices he imitated, he produced all sorts of unexpected\r\nthings--shocks of light and darkness; spontaneous formations of figures\r\nor words, as he willed, on the partition; vanishing figures in\r\nchiaroscuro; strange things, amidst which he seemed to meditate,\r\nunmindful of the crowd who marvelled at him.\r\n\r\nOne day Gwynplaine said to him,--\r\n\r\n“Father, you look like a sorcerer!”\r\n\r\nAnd Ursus replied,--\r\n\r\n“Then I look, perhaps, like what I am.”\r\n\r\nThe Green Box, built on a clear model of Ursus’s, contained this\r\nrefinement of ingenuity--that between the fore and hind wheels the\r\ncentral panel of the left side turned on hinges by the aid of chains and\r\npulleys, and could be let down at will like a drawbridge. As it dropped\r\nit set at liberty three legs on hinges, which supported the panel when\r\nlet down, and which placed themselves straight on the ground like the\r\nlegs of a table, and supported it above the earth like a platform. This\r\nexposed the stage, which was thus enlarged by the platform in front.\r\n\r\nThis opening looked for all the world like a “mouth of hell,” in the\r\nwords of the itinerant Puritan preachers, who turned away from it with\r\nhorror. It was, perhaps, for some such pious invention that Solon kicked\r\nout Thespis.\r\n\r\nFor all that Thespis has lasted much longer than is generally believed.\r\nThe travelling theatre is still in existence. It was on those stages on\r\nwheels that, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, they performed\r\nin England the ballets and dances of Amner and Pilkington; in France,\r\nthe pastorals of Gilbert Colin; in Flanders, at the annual fairs, the\r\ndouble choruses of Clement, called Non Papa; in Germany, the “Adam and\r\nEve” of Theiles; and, in Italy, the Venetian exhibitions of Animuccia\r\nand of Cafossis, the “Silvæ” of Gesualdo, the “Prince of Venosa,” the\r\n“Satyr” of Laura Guidiccioni, the “Despair of Philene,” the “Death of\r\nUgolina,” by Vincent Galileo, father of the astronomer, which Vincent\r\nGalileo sang his own music, and accompanied himself on his _viol de\r\ngamba_; as well as all the first attempts of the Italian opera which,\r\nfrom 1580, substituted free inspiration for the madrigal style.\r\n\r\nThe chariot, of the colour of hope, which carried Ursus, Gwynplaine, and\r\ntheir fortunes, and in front of which Fibi and Vinos trumpeted like\r\nfigures of Fame, played its part of this grand Bohemian and literary\r\nbrotherhood. Thespis would no more have disowned Ursus than Congrio\r\nwould have disowned Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nArrived at open spaces in towns or villages, Ursus, in the intervals\r\nbetween the too-tooing of Fibi and Vinos, gave instructive revelations\r\nas to the trumpetings.\r\n\r\n“This symphony is Gregorian,” he would exclaim. “Citizens and townsmen,\r\nthe Gregorian form of worship, this great progress, is opposed in Italy\r\nto the Ambrosial ritual, and in Spain to the Mozarabic ceremonial, and\r\nhas achieved its triumph over them with difficulty.”\r\n\r\nAfter which the Green Box drew up in some place chosen by Ursus, and\r\nevening having fallen, and the panel stage having been let down, the\r\ntheatre opened, and the performance began.\r\n\r\nThe scene of the Green Box represented a landscape painted by Ursus; and\r\nas he did not know how to paint, it represented a cavern just as well as\r\na landscape. The curtain, which we call drop nowadays, was a checked\r\nsilk, with squares of contrasted colours.\r\n\r\nThe public stood without, in the street, in the fair, forming a\r\nsemicircle round the stage, exposed to the sun and the showers; an\r\narrangement which made rain less desirable for theatres in those days\r\nthan now. When they could, they acted in an inn yard, on which occasions\r\nthe windows of the different stories made rows of boxes for the\r\nspectators. The theatre was thus more enclosed, and the audience a more\r\npaying one. Ursus was in everything--in the piece, in the company, in\r\nthe kitchen, in the orchestra. Vinos beat the drum, and handled the\r\nsticks with great dexterity. Fibi played on the _morache_, a kind of\r\nguitar. The wolf had been promoted to be a utility gentleman, and\r\nplayed, as occasion required, his little parts. Often when they appeared\r\nside by side on the stage--Ursus in his tightly-laced bear’s skin, Homo\r\nwith his wolf’s skin fitting still better--no one could tell which was\r\nthe beast. This flattered Ursus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nABSURDITIES WHICH FOLKS WITHOUT TASTE CALL POETRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pieces written by Ursus were interludes--a kind of composition out\r\nof fashion nowadays. One of these pieces, which has not come down to us,\r\nwas entitled “Ursus Rursus.” It is probable that he played the principal\r\npart himself. A pretended exit, followed by a reappearance, was\r\napparently its praiseworthy and sober subject. The titles of the\r\ninterludes of Ursus were sometimes Latin, as we have seen, and the\r\npoetry frequently Spanish. The Spanish verses written by Ursus were\r\nrhymed, as was nearly all the Castilian poetry of that period. This did\r\nnot puzzle the people. Spanish was then a familiar language; and the\r\nEnglish sailors spoke Castilian even as the Roman sailors spoke\r\nCarthaginian (see Plautus). Moreover, at a theatrical representation, as\r\nat mass, Latin, or any other language unknown to the audience, is by no\r\nmeans a subject of care with them. They get out of the dilemma by\r\nadapting to the sounds familiar words. Our old Gallic France was\r\nparticularly prone to this manner of being devout. At church, under\r\ncover of an _Immolatus_, the faithful chanted, “I will make merry;” and\r\nunder a _Sanctus_, “Kiss me, sweet.”\r\n\r\nThe Council of Trent was required to put an end to these familiarities.\r\n\r\nUrsus had composed expressly for Gwynplaine an interlude, with which he\r\nwas well pleased. It was his best work. He had thrown his whole soul\r\ninto it. To give the sum of all one’s talents in the production is the\r\ngreatest triumph that any one can achieve. The toad which produces a\r\ntoad achieves a grand success. You doubt it? Try, then, to do as much.\r\n\r\nUrsus had carefully polished this interlude. This bear’s cub was\r\nentitled “Chaos Vanquished.” Here it was:--A night scene. When the\r\ncurtain drew up, the crowd, massed around the Green Box, saw nothing but\r\nblackness. In this blackness three confused forms moved in the reptile\r\nstate--wolf, a bear, and a man. The wolf acted the wolf; Ursus, the\r\nbear; Gwynplaine, the man. The wolf and the bear represented the\r\nferocious forces of Nature--unreasoning hunger and savage ignorance.\r\nBoth rushed on Gwynplaine. It was chaos combating man. No face could be\r\ndistinguished. Gwynplaine fought infolded, in a winding-sheet, and his\r\nface was covered by his thickly-falling locks. All else was shadow. The\r\nbear growled, the wolf gnashed his teeth, the man cried out. The man was\r\ndown; the beasts overwhelmed him. He cried for aid and succour; he\r\nhurled to the unknown an agonized appeal. He gave a death-rattle. To\r\nwitness this agony of the prostrate man, now scarcely distinguishable\r\nfrom the brutes, was appalling. The crowd looked on breathless; in one\r\nminute more the wild beasts would triumph, and chaos reabsorb man. A\r\nstruggle--cries--howlings; then, all at once, silence.\r\n\r\nA song in the shadows. A breath had passed, and they heard a voice.\r\nMysterious music floated, accompanying this chant of the invisible; and\r\nsuddenly, none knowing whence or how, a white apparition arose. This\r\napparition was a light; this light was a woman; this woman was a spirit.\r\nDea--calm, fair, beautiful, formidable in her serenity and\r\nsweetness--appeared in the centre of a luminous mist. A profile of\r\nbrightness in a dawn! She was a voice--a voice light, deep,\r\nindescribable. She sang in the new-born light--she, invisible, made\r\nvisible. They thought that they heard the hymn of an angel or the song\r\nof a bird. At this apparition the man, starting up in his ecstasy,\r\nstruck the beasts with his fists, and overthrew them.\r\n\r\nThen the vision, gliding along in a manner difficult to understand, and\r\ntherefore the more admired, sang these words in Spanish sufficiently\r\npure for the English sailors who were present:--\r\n\r\n  “Ora! llora!\r\n  De palabra\r\n  Nace razon.\r\n  De luz el son.”[13]\r\n\r\nThen looking down, as if she saw a gulf beneath, she went on,--\r\n\r\n  “Noche, quita te de alli!\r\n  El alba canta hallali.”[14]\r\n\r\nAs she sang, the man raised himself by degrees; instead of lying he was\r\nnow kneeling, his hands elevated towards the vision, his knees resting\r\non the beasts, which lay motionless, and as if thunder-stricken.\r\n\r\nShe continued, turning towards him,--\r\n\r\n  “Es menester a cielos ir,\r\n  Y tu que llorabas reir.”[15]\r\n\r\nAnd approaching him with the majesty of a star, she added,--\r\n\r\n  “Gebra barzon;\r\n  Deja, monstruo,\r\n  A tu negro\r\n  Caparazon.”[16]\r\n\r\nAnd she put hot hand on his brow. Then another voice arose, deeper, and\r\nconsequently still sweeter--a voice broken and enwrapt with a gravity\r\nboth tender and wild. It was the human chant responding to the chant of\r\nthe stars. Gwynplaine, still in obscurity, his head under Dea’s hand,\r\nand kneeling on the vanquished bear and wolf, sang,--\r\n\r\n  “O ven! ama!\r\n  Eres alma,\r\n  Soy corazon.”[17]\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly from the shadow a ray of light fell full upon Gwynplaine.\r\nThen, through the darkness, was the monster full exposed.\r\n\r\nTo describe the commotion of the crowd is impossible.\r\n\r\nA sun of laughter rising, such was the effect. Laughter springs from\r\nunexpected causes, and nothing could be more unexpected than this\r\ntermination. Never was sensation comparable to that produced by the ray\r\nof light striking on that mask, at once ludicrous and terrible. They\r\nlaughed all around his laugh. Everywhere--above, below, behind, before,\r\nat the uttermost distance; men, women, old gray-heads, rosy-faced\r\nchildren; the good, the wicked, the gay, the sad, everybody. And even in\r\nthe streets, the passers-by who could see nothing, hearing the laughter,\r\nlaughed also. The laughter ended in clapping of hands and stamping of\r\nfeet. The curtain dropped: Gwynplaine was recalled with frenzy. Hence an\r\nimmense success. Have you seen “Chaos Vanquished?” Gwynplaine was run\r\nafter. The listless came to laugh, the melancholy came to laugh, evil\r\nconsciences came to laugh--a laugh so irresistible that it seemed almost\r\nan epidemic. But there is a pestilence from which men do not fly, and\r\nthat is the contagion of joy. The success, it must be admitted, did not\r\nrise higher than the populace. A great crowd means a crowd of nobodies.\r\n“Chaos Vanquished” could be seen for a penny. Fashionable people never\r\ngo where the price of admission is a penny.\r\n\r\nUrsus thought a good deal of his work, which he had brooded over for a\r\nlong time. “It is in the style of one Shakespeare,” he said modestly.\r\n\r\nThe juxtaposition of Dea added to the indescribable effect produced by\r\nGwynplaine. Her white face by the side of the gnome represented what\r\nmight have been called divine astonishment. The audience regarded Dea\r\nwith a sort of mysterious anxiety. She had in her aspect the dignity of\r\na virgin and of a priestess, not knowing man and knowing God. They saw\r\nthat she was blind, and felt that she could see. She seemed to stand on\r\nthe threshold of the supernatural. The light that beamed on her seemed\r\nhalf earthly and half heavenly. She had come to work on earth, and to\r\nwork as heaven works, in the radiance of morning. Finding a hydra, she\r\nformed a soul. She seemed like a creative power, satisfied but\r\nastonished at the result of her creation; and the audience fancied that\r\nthey could see in the divine surprise of that face desire of the cause\r\nand wonder at the result. They felt that she loved this monster. Did she\r\nknow that he was one? Yes; since she touched him. No; since she\r\naccepted him. This depth of night and this glory of day united, formed\r\nin the mind of the spectator a chiaroscuro in which appeared endless\r\nperspectives. How much divinity exists in the germ, in what manner the\r\npenetration of the soul into matter is accomplished, how the solar ray\r\nis an umbilical cord, how the disfigured is transfigured, how the\r\ndeformed becomes heavenly--all these glimpses of mysteries added an\r\nalmost cosmical emotion to the convulsive hilarity produced by\r\nGwynplaine. Without going too deep--for spectators do not like the\r\nfatigue of seeking below the surface--something more was understood than\r\nwas perceived. And this strange spectacle had the transparency of an\r\navatar.\r\n\r\nAs to Dea, what she felt cannot be expressed by human words. She knew\r\nthat she was in the midst of a crowd, and knew not what a crowd was. She\r\nheard a murmur, that was all. For her the crowd was but a breath.\r\nGenerations are passing breaths. Man respires, aspires, and expires. In\r\nthat crowd Dea felt herself alone, and shuddering as one hanging over a\r\nprecipice. Suddenly, in this trouble of innocence in distress, prompt to\r\naccuse the unknown, in her dread of a possible fall, Dea, serene\r\nnotwithstanding, and superior to the vague agonies of peril, but\r\ninwardly shuddering at her isolation, found confidence and support. She\r\nhad seized her thread of safety in the universe of shadows; she put her\r\nhand on the powerful head of Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nJoy unspeakable! she placed her rosy fingers on his forest of crisp\r\nhair. Wool when touched gives an impression of softness. Dea touched a\r\nlamb which she knew to be a lion. Her whole heart poured out an\r\nineffable love. She felt out of danger--she had found her saviour. The\r\npublic believed that they saw the contrary. To the spectators the being\r\nloved was Gwynplaine, and the saviour was Dea. What matters? thought\r\nUrsus, to whom the heart of Dea was visible. And Dea, reassured,\r\nconsoled and delighted, adored the angel whilst the people contemplated\r\nthe monster, and endured, fascinated herself as well, though in the\r\nopposite sense, that dread Promethean laugh.\r\n\r\nTrue love is never weary. Being all soul it cannot cool. A brazier comes\r\nto be full of cinders; not so a star. Her exquisite impressions were\r\nrenewed every evening for Dea, and she was ready to weep with tenderness\r\nwhilst the audience was in convulsions of laughter. Those around her\r\nwere but joyful; she was happy.\r\n\r\nThe sensation of gaiety due to the sudden shock caused by the rictus of\r\nGwynplaine was evidently not intended by Ursus. He would have preferred\r\nmore smiles and less laughter, and more of a literary triumph. But\r\nsuccess consoles. He reconciled himself every evening to his excessive\r\ntriumph, as he counted how many shillings the piles of farthings made,\r\nand how many pounds the piles of shillings; and besides, he said, after\r\nall, when the laugh had passed, “Chaos Vanquished” would be found in the\r\ndepths of their minds, and something of it would remain there.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was not altogether wrong: the foundations of a work settle\r\ndown in the mind of the public. The truth is, that the populace,\r\nattentive to the wolf, the bear, to the man, then to the music, to the\r\nhowlings governed by harmony, to the night dissipated by dawn, to the\r\nchant releasing the light, accepted with a confused, dull sympathy, and\r\nwith a certain emotional respect, the dramatic poem of “Chaos\r\nVanquished,” the victory of spirit over matter, ending with the joy of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nSuch were the vulgar pleasures of the people.\r\n\r\nThey sufficed them. The people had not the means of going to the noble\r\nmatches of the gentry, and could not, like lords and gentlemen, bet a\r\nthousand guineas on Helmsgail against Phelem-ghe-madone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nAN OUTSIDER’S VIEW OF MEN AND THINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan has a notion of revenging himself on that which pleases him. Hence\r\nthe contempt felt for the comedian.\r\n\r\nThis being charms me, diverts, distracts, teaches, enchants, consoles\r\nme; flings me into an ideal world, is agreeable and useful to me. What\r\nevil can I do him in return? Humiliate him. Disdain is a blow from afar.\r\nLet us strike the blow. He pleases me, therefore he is vile. He serves\r\nme, therefore I hate him. Where can I find a stone to throw at him?\r\nPriest, give me yours. Philosopher, give me yours. Bossuet,\r\nexcommunicate him. Rousseau, insult him. Orator, spit the pebbles from\r\nyour mouth at him. Bear, fling your stone. Let us cast stones at the\r\ntree, hit the fruit and eat it. “Bravo!” and “Down with him!” To repeat\r\npoetry is to be infected with the plague. Wretched playactor, we will\r\nput him in the pillory for his success. Let him follow up his triumph\r\nwith our hisses. Let him collect a crowd and create a solitude. Thus it\r\nis that the wealthy, termed the higher classes, have invented for the\r\nactor that form of isolation, applause.\r\n\r\nThe crowd is less brutal. They neither hated nor despised Gwynplaine.\r\nOnly the meanest calker of the meanest crew of the meanest merchantman,\r\nanchored in the meanest English seaport, considered himself immeasurably\r\nsuperior to this amuser of the “scum,” and believed that a calker is as\r\nsuperior to an actor as a lord is to a calker.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine was, therefore, like all comedians, applauded and kept at a\r\ndistance. Truly, all success in this world is a crime, and must be\r\nexpiated. He who obtains the medal has to take its reverse side as well.\r\n\r\nFor Gwynplaine there was no reverse. In this sense, both sides of his\r\nmedal pleased him. He was satisfied with the applause, and content with\r\nthe isolation. In applause he was rich, in isolation happy.\r\n\r\nTo be rich in his low estate means to be no longer wretchedly poor--to\r\nhave neither holes in his clothes, nor cold at his hearth, nor emptiness\r\nin his stomach. It is to eat when hungry and drink when thirsty. It is\r\nto have everything necessary, including a penny for a beggar. This\r\nindigent wealth, enough for liberty, was possessed by Gwynplaine. So far\r\nas his soul was concerned, he was opulent. He had love. What more could\r\nhe want? Nothing.\r\n\r\nYou may think that had the offer been made to him to remove his\r\ndeformity he would have grasped at it. Yet he would have refused it\r\nemphatically. What! to throw off his mask and have his former face\r\nrestored; to be the creature he had perchance been created, handsome and\r\ncharming? No, he would never have consented to it. For what would he\r\nhave to support Dea? What would have become of that poor child, the\r\nsweet blind girl who loved him? Without his rictus, which made him a\r\nclown without parallel, he would have been a mountebank, like any other;\r\na common athlete, a picker up of pence from the chinks in the pavement,\r\nand Dea would perhaps not have had bread every day. It was with deep and\r\ntender pride that he felt himself the protector of the helpless and\r\nheavenly creature. Night, solitude, nakedness, weakness, ignorance,\r\nhunger, and thirst--seven yawning jaws of misery--were raised around\r\nher, and he was the St. George fighting the dragon. He triumphed over\r\npoverty. How? By his deformity. By his deformity he was useful, helpful,\r\nvictorious, great. He had but to show himself, and money poured in. He\r\nwas a master of crowds, the sovereign of the mob. He could do everything\r\nfor Dea. Her wants he foresaw; her desires, her tastes, her fancies, in\r\nthe limited sphere in which wishes are possible to the blind, he\r\nfulfilled. Gwynplaine and Dea were, as we have already shown, Providence\r\nto each other. He felt himself raised on her wings; she felt herself\r\ncarried in his arms. To protect the being who loves you, to give what\r\nshe requires to her who shines on you as your star, can anything be\r\nsweeter? Gwynplaine possessed this supreme happiness, and he owed it to\r\nhis deformity. His deformity had raised him above all. By it he had\r\ngained the means of life for himself and others; by it he had gained\r\nindependence, liberty, celebrity, internal satisfaction and pride. In\r\nhis deformity he was inaccessible. The Fates could do nothing beyond\r\nthis blow in which they had spent their whole force, and which he had\r\nturned into a triumph. This lowest depth of misfortune had become the\r\nsummit of Elysium. Gwynplaine was imprisoned in his deformity, but with\r\nDea. And this was, as we have already said, to live in a dungeon of\r\nparadise. A wall stood between them and the living world. So much the\r\nbetter. This wall protected as well as enclosed them. What could affect\r\nDea, what could affect Gwynplaine, with such a fortress around them? To\r\ntake from him his success was impossible. They would have had to deprive\r\nhim of his face. Take from him his love. Impossible. Dea could not see\r\nhim. The blindness of Dea was divinely incurable. What harm did his\r\ndeformity do Gwynplaine? None. What advantage did it give him? Every\r\nadvantage. He was beloved, notwithstanding its horror, and perhaps for\r\nthat very cause. Infirmity and deformity had by instinct been drawn\r\ntowards and coupled with each other. To be beloved, is not that\r\neverything? Gwynplaine thought of his disfigurement only with gratitude.\r\nHe was blessed in the stigma. With joy he felt that it was irremediable\r\nand eternal. What a blessing that it was so! While there were highways\r\nand fairgrounds, and journeys to take, the people below and the sky\r\nabove, they would be sure to live, Dea would want nothing, and they\r\nshould have love. Gwynplaine would not have changed faces with Apollo.\r\nTo be a monster was his form of happiness.\r\n\r\nThus, as we said before, destiny had given him all, even to overflowing.\r\nHe who had been rejected had been preferred.\r\n\r\nHe was so happy that he felt compassion for the men around him. He\r\npitied the rest of the world. It was, besides, his instinct to look\r\nabout him, because no one is always consistent, and a man’s nature is\r\nnot always theoretic; he was delighted to live within an enclosure, but\r\nfrom time to time he lifted his head above the wall. Then he retreated\r\nagain with more joy into his loneliness with Dea, having drawn his\r\ncomparisons. What did he see around him?\r\n\r\nWhat were those living creatures of which his wandering life showed him\r\nso many specimens, changed every day? Always new crowds, always the same\r\nmultitude, ever new faces, ever the same miseries. A jumble of ruins.\r\nEvery evening every phase of social misfortune came and encircled his\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nThe Green Box was popular.\r\n\r\nLow prices attract the low classes. Those who came were the weak, the\r\npoor, the little. They rushed to Gwynplaine as they rushed to gin. They\r\ncame to buy a pennyworth of forgetfulness. From the height of his\r\nplatform Gwynplaine passed those wretched people in review. His spirit\r\nwas enwrapt in the contemplation of every succeeding apparition of\r\nwidespread misery. The physiognomy of man is modelled by conscience, and\r\nby the tenor of life, and is the result of a crowd of mysterious\r\nexcavations. There was never a suffering, not an anger, not a shame, not\r\na despair, of which Gwynplaine did not see the wrinkle. The mouths of\r\nthose children had not eaten. That man was a father, that woman a\r\nmother, and behind them their families might be guessed to be on the\r\nroad to ruin. There was a face already marked by vice, on the threshold\r\nof crime, and the reasons were plain--ignorance and indigence. Another\r\nshowed the stamp of original goodness, obliterated by social pressure,\r\nand turned to hate. On the face of an old woman he saw starvation; on\r\nthat of a girl, prostitution. The same fact, and although the girl had\r\nthe resource of her youth, all the sadder for that! In the crowd were\r\narms without tools; the workers asked only for work, but the work was\r\nwanting. Sometimes a soldier came and seated himself by the workmen,\r\nsometimes a wounded pensioner; and Gwynplaine saw the spectre of war.\r\nHere Gwynplaine read want of work; there man-farming, slavery. On\r\ncertain brows he saw an indescribable ebbing back towards animalism, and\r\nthat slow return of man to beast, produced on those below by the dull\r\npressure of the happiness of those above. There was a break in the gloom\r\nfor Gwynplaine. He and Dea had a loophole of happiness; the rest was\r\ndamnation. Gwynplaine felt above him the thoughtless trampling of the\r\npowerful, the rich, the magnificent, the great, the elect of chance.\r\nBelow he saw the pale faces of the disinherited. He saw himself and Dea,\r\nwith their little happiness, so great to themselves, between two worlds.\r\nThat which was above went and came, free, joyous, dancing, trampling\r\nunder foot; above him the world which treads, below the world which is\r\ntrodden upon. It is a fatal fact, and one indicating a profound social\r\nevil, that light should crush the shadow! Gwynplaine thoroughly grasped\r\nthis dark evil. What! a destiny so reptile? Shall a man drag himself\r\nthus along with such adherence to dust and corruption, with such vicious\r\ntastes, such an abdication of right, or such abjectness that one feels\r\ninclined to crush him under foot? Of what butterfly is, then, this\r\nearthly life the grub?\r\n\r\nWhat! in the crowd which hungers and which denies everywhere, and before\r\nall, the questions of crime and shame (the inflexibility of the law\r\nproducing laxity of conscience), is there no child that grows but to be\r\nstunted, no virgin but matures for sin, no rose that blooms but for the\r\nslime of the snail?\r\n\r\nHis eyes at times sought everywhere, with the curiosity of emotion, to\r\nprobe the depths of that darkness, in which there died away so many\r\nuseless efforts, and in which there struggled so much weariness:\r\nfamilies devoured by society, morals tortured by the laws, wounds\r\ngangrened by penalties, poverty gnawed by taxes, wrecked intelligence\r\nswallowed up by ignorance, rafts in distress alive with the famished,\r\nfeuds, dearth, death-rattles, cries, disappearances. He felt the vague\r\noppression of a keen, universal suffering. He saw the vision of the\r\nfoaming wave of misery dashing over the crowd of humanity. He was safe\r\nin port himself, as he watched the wreck around him. Sometimes he laid\r\nhis disfigured head in his hands and dreamed.\r\n\r\nWhat folly to be happy! How one dreams! Ideas were born within him.\r\nAbsurd notions crossed his brain.\r\n\r\nBecause formerly he had succoured an infant, he felt a ridiculous desire\r\nto succour the whole world. The mists of reverie sometimes obscured his\r\nindividuality, and he lost his ideas of proportion so far as to ask\r\nhimself the question, “What can be done for the poor?” Sometimes he was\r\nso absorbed in his subject as to express it aloud. Then Ursus shrugged\r\nhis shoulders and looked at him fixedly. Gwynplaine continued his\r\nreverie.\r\n\r\n“Oh; were I powerful, would I not aid the wretched? But what am I? An\r\natom. What can I do? Nothing.”\r\n\r\nHe was mistaken. He was able to do a great deal for the wretched. He\r\ncould make them laugh; and, as we have said, to make people laugh is to\r\nmake them forget. What a benefactor on earth is he who can bestow\r\nforgetfulness!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nGWYNPLAINE THINKS JUSTICE, AND URSUS TALKS TRUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nA philosopher is a spy. Ursus, a watcher of dreams, studied his pupil.\r\n\r\nOur monologues leave on our brows a faint reflection, distinguishable to\r\nthe eye of a physiognomist. Hence what occurred to Gwynplaine did not\r\nescape Ursus. One day, as Gwynplaine was meditating, Ursus pulled him by\r\nhis jacket, and exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“You strike me as being an observer! You fool! Take care; it is no\r\nbusiness of yours. You have one thing to do--to love Dea. You have two\r\ncauses of happiness--the first is, that the crowd sees your muzzle; the\r\nsecond is, that Dea does not. You have no right to the happiness you\r\npossess, for no woman who saw your mouth would consent to your kiss; and\r\nthat mouth which has made your fortune, and that face which has given\r\nyou riches, are not your own. You were not born with that countenance.\r\nIt was borrowed from the grimace which is at the bottom of the infinite.\r\nYou have stolen your mask from the devil. You are hideous; be satisfied\r\nwith having drawn that prize in the lottery. There are in this world\r\n(and a very good thing too) the happy by right and the happy by luck.\r\nYou are happy by luck. You are in a cave wherein a star is enclosed. The\r\npoor star belongs to you. Do not seek to leave the cave, and guard your\r\nstar, O spider! You have in your web the carbuncle, Venus. Do me the\r\nfavour to be satisfied. I see your dreams are troubled. It is idiotic of\r\nyou. Listen; I am going to speak to you in the language of true poetry.\r\nLet Dea eat beefsteaks and mutton chops, and in six months she will be\r\nas strong as a Turk; marry her immediately, give her a child, two\r\nchildren, three children, a long string of children. That is what I call\r\nphilosophy. Moreover, it is happiness, which is no folly. To have\r\nchildren is a glimpse of heaven. Have brats--wipe them, blow their\r\nnoses, dirt them, wash them, and put them to bed. Let them swarm about\r\nyou. If they laugh, it is well; if they howl, it is better--to cry is to\r\nlive. Watch them suck at six months, crawl at a year, walk at two, grow\r\ntall at fifteen, fall in love at twenty. He who has these joys has\r\neverything For myself, I lacked the advantage; and that is the reason\r\nwhy I am a brute. God, a composer of beautiful poems and the first of\r\nmen of letters, said to his fellow-workman, Moses, ‘Increase and\r\nmultiply.’ Such is the text. Multiply, you beast! As to the world, it is\r\nas it is; you cannot make nor mar it. Do not trouble yourself about it.\r\nPay no attention to what goes on outside. Leave the horizon alone. A\r\ncomedian is made to be looked at, not to look. Do you know what there is\r\noutside? The happy by right. You, I repeat, are the happy by chance. You\r\nare the pickpocket of the happiness of which they are the proprietors.\r\nThey are the legitimate possessors; you are the intruder. You live in\r\nconcubinage with luck. What do you want that you have not already?\r\nShibboleth help me! This fellow is a rascal. To multiply himself by Dea\r\nwould be pleasant, all the same. Such happiness is like a swindle. Those\r\nabove who possess happiness by privilege do not like folks below them to\r\nhave so much enjoyment. If they ask you what right you have to be happy,\r\nyou will not know what to answer. You have no patent, and they have.\r\nJupiter, Allah, Vishnu, Sabaoth, it does not matter who, has given them\r\nthe passport to happiness. Fear them. Do not meddle with them, lest they\r\nshould meddle with you. Wretch! do you know what the man is who is happy\r\nby right? He is a terrible being. He is a lord. A lord! He must have\r\nintrigued pretty well in the devil’s unknown country before he was\r\nborn, to enter life by the door he did. How difficult it must have been\r\nto him to be born! It is the only trouble he has given himself; but,\r\njust heavens, what a one!--to obtain from destiny, the blind blockhead,\r\nto mark him in his cradle a master of men. To bribe the box-keeper to\r\ngive him the best place at the show. Read the memoranda in the old hut,\r\nwhich I have placed on half-pay. Read that breviary of my wisdom, and\r\nyou will see what it is to be a lord. A lord is one who has all and is\r\nall. A lord is one who exists above his own nature. A lord is one who\r\nhas when young the rights of an old man; when old, the success in\r\nintrigue of a young one; if vicious, the homage of respectable people;\r\nif a coward, the command of brave men; if a do-nothing, the fruits of\r\nlabour; if ignorant, the diploma of Cambridge or Oxford; if a fool, the\r\nadmiration of poets; if ugly, the smiles of women; if a Thersites, the\r\nhelm of Achilles; if a hare, the skin of a lion. Do not misunderstand my\r\nwords. I do not say that a lord must necessarily be ignorant, a coward,\r\nugly, stupid, or old. I only mean that he may be all those things\r\nwithout any detriment to himself. On the contrary. Lords are princes.\r\nThe King of England is only a lord, the first peer of the peerage; that\r\nis all, but it is much. Kings were formerly called lords--the Lord of\r\nDenmark, the Lord of Ireland, the Lord of the Isles. The Lord of Norway\r\nwas first called king three hundred years ago. Lucius, the most ancient\r\nking in England, was spoken to by Saint Telesphonis as my Lord Lucius.\r\nThe lords are peers--that is to say, equals--of whom? Of the king. I do\r\nnot commit the mistake of confounding the lords with parliament. The\r\nassembly of the people which the Saxons before the Conquest called\r\n_wittenagemote_, the Normans, after the Conquest, entitled\r\n_parliamentum_. By degrees the people were turned out. The king’s\r\nletters clause convoking the Commons, addressed formerly _ad concilium\r\nimpendendum_, are now addressed _ad consentiendum_. To say yes is their\r\nliberty. The peers can say no; and the proof is that they have said it.\r\nThe peers can cut off the king’s head. The people cannot. The stroke of\r\nthe hatchet which decapitated Charles I. is an encroachment, not on the\r\nking, but on the peers, and it was well to place on the gibbet the\r\ncarcass of Cromwell. The lords have power. Why? Because they have\r\nriches. Who has turned over the leaves of the Doomsday Book? It is the\r\nproof that the lords possess England. It is the registry of the estates\r\nof subjects, compiled under William the Conqueror; and it is in the\r\ncharge of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. To copy anything in it you\r\nhave to pay twopence a line. It is a proud book. Do you know that I was\r\ndomestic doctor to a lord, who was called Marmaduke, and who had\r\nthirty-six thousand a year? Think of that, you hideous idiot! Do you\r\nknow that, with rabbits only from the warrens of Earl Lindsay, they\r\ncould feed all the riffraff of the Cinque Ports? And the good order\r\nkept! Every poacher is hung. For two long furry ears sticking out of a\r\ngame bag I saw the father of six children hanging on the gibbet. Such is\r\nthe peerage. The rabbit of a great lord is of more importance than God’s\r\nimage in a man.\r\n\r\n“Lords exist, you trespasser, do you see? and we must think it good that\r\nthey do; and even if we do not, what harm will it do them? The people\r\nobject, indeed! Why? Plautus himself would never have attained the\r\ncomicality of such an idea. A philosopher would be jesting if he advised\r\nthe poor devil of the masses to cry out against the size and weight of\r\nthe lords. Just as well might the gnat dispute with the foot of an\r\nelephant. One day I saw a hippopotamus tread upon a molehill; he crushed\r\nit utterly. He was innocent. The great soft-headed fool of a mastodon\r\ndid not even know of the existence of moles. My son, the moles that are\r\ntrodden on are the human race. To crush is a law. And do you think that\r\nthe mole himself crushes nothing? Why, it is the mastodon of the\r\nfleshworm, who is the mastodon of the globeworm. But let us cease\r\narguing. My boy, there are coaches in the world; my lord is inside, the\r\npeople under the wheels; the philosopher gets out of the way. Stand\r\naside, and let them pass. As to myself, I love lords, and shun them. I\r\nlived with one; the beauty of my recollections suffices me. I remember\r\nhis country house, like a glory in a cloud. My dreams are all\r\nretrospective. Nothing could be more admirable than Marmaduke Lodge in\r\ngrandeur, beautiful symmetry, rich avenues, and the ornaments and\r\nsurroundings of the edifice. The houses, country seats, and palaces of\r\nthe lords present a selection of all that is greatest and most\r\nmagnificent in this flourishing kingdom. I love our lords. I thank them\r\nfor being opulent, powerful, and prosperous. I myself am clothed in\r\nshadow, and I look with interest upon the shred of heavenly blue which\r\nis called a lord. You enter Marmaduke Lodge by an exceedingly spacious\r\ncourtyard, which forms an oblong square, divided into eight spaces, each\r\nsurrounded by a balustrade; on each side is a wide approach, and a\r\nsuperb hexagonal fountain plays in the midst; this fountain is formed of\r\ntwo basins, which are surmounted by a dome of exquisite openwork,\r\nelevated on six columns. It was there that I knew a learned Frenchman,\r\nMonsieur l’Abbé du Cros, who belonged to the Jacobin monastery in the\r\nRue Saint Jacques. Half the library of Erpenius is at Marmaduke Lodge,\r\nthe other half being at the theological gallery at Cambridge. I used to\r\nread the books, seated under the ornamented portal. These things are\r\nonly shown to a select number of curious travellers. Do you know, you\r\nridiculous boy, that William North, who is Lord Grey of Rolleston, and\r\nsits fourteenth on the bench of Barons, has more forest trees on his\r\nmountains than you have hairs on your horrible noddle? Do you know that\r\nLord Norreys of Rycote, who is Earl of Abingdon, has a square keep a\r\nhundred feet high, having this device--_Virtus ariete fortior_; which\r\nyou would think meant that virtue is stronger than a ram, but which\r\nreally means, you idiot, that courage is stronger than a\r\nbattering-machine. Yes, I honour, accept, respect, and revere our lords.\r\nIt is the lords who, with her royal Majesty, work to procure and\r\npreserve the advantages of the nation. Their consummate wisdom shines in\r\nintricate junctures. Their precedence over others I wish they had not;\r\nbut they have it. What is called principality in Germany, grandeeship in\r\nSpain, is called peerage in England and France. There being a fair show\r\nof reason for considering the world a wretched place enough, heaven felt\r\nwhere the burden was most galling, and to prove that it knew how to make\r\nhappy people, created lords for the satisfaction of philosophers. This\r\nacts as a set-off, and gets heaven out of the scrape, affording it a\r\ndecent escape from a false position. The great are great. A peer,\r\nspeaking of himself, says _we_. A peer is a plural. The king qualifies\r\nthe peer _consanguinei nostri_. The peers have made a multitude of wise\r\nlaws; amongst others, one which condemns to death any one who cuts down\r\na three-year-old poplar tree. Their supremacy is such that they have a\r\nlanguage of their own. In heraldic style, black, which is called sable\r\nfor gentry, is called saturne for princes, and diamond for peers.\r\nDiamond dust, a night thick with stars, such is the night of the happy!\r\nEven amongst themselves these high and mighty lords have their own\r\ndistinctions. A baron cannot wash with a viscount without his\r\npermission. These are indeed excellent things, and safeguards to the\r\nnation. What a fine thing it is for the people to have twenty-five\r\ndukes, five marquises, seventy-six earls, nine viscounts, and sixty-one\r\nbarons, making altogether a hundred and seventy-six peers, of which some\r\nare your grace, and some my lord! What matter a few rags here and there,\r\nwithal: everybody cannot be dressed in gold. Let the rags be. Cannot you\r\nsee the purple? One balances the other. A thing must be built of\r\nsomething. Yes, of course, there are the poor--what of them! They line\r\nthe happiness of the wealthy. Devil take it! our lords are our glory!\r\nThe pack of hounds belonging to Charles, Baron Mohun, costs him as much\r\nas the hospital for lepers in Moorgate, and for Christ’s Hospital,\r\nfounded for children, in 1553, by Edward VI. Thomas Osborne, Duke of\r\nLeeds, spends yearly on his liveries five thousand golden guineas. The\r\nSpanish grandees have a guardian appointed by law to prevent their\r\nruining themselves. That is cowardly. Our lords are extravagant and\r\nmagnificent. I esteem them for it. Let us not abuse them like envious\r\nfolks. I feel happy when a beautiful vision passes. I have not the\r\nlight, but I have the reflection. A reflection thrown on my ulcer, you\r\nwill say. Go to the devil! I am a Job, delighted in the contemplation of\r\nTrimalcion. Oh, that beautiful and radiant planet up there! But the\r\nmoonlight is something. To suppress the lords was an idea which Orestes,\r\nmad as he was, would not have dared to entertain. To say that the lords\r\nare mischievous or useless is as much as to say that the state should be\r\nrevolutionized, and that men are not made to live like cattle, browsing\r\nthe grass and bitten by the dog. The field is shorn by the sheep, the\r\nsheep by the shepherd. It is all one to me. I am a philosopher, and I\r\ncare about life as much as a fly. Life is but a lodging. When I think\r\nthat Henry Bowes Howard, Earl of Berkshire, has in his stable\r\ntwenty-four state carriages, of which one is mounted in silver and\r\nanother in gold--good heavens! I know that every one has not got\r\ntwenty-four state carriages; but there is no need to complain for all\r\nthat. Because you were cold one night, what was that to him? It concerns\r\nyou only. Others besides you suffer cold and hunger. Don’t you know\r\nthat without that cold, Dea would not have been blind, and if Dea were\r\nnot blind she would not love you? Think of that, you fool! And, besides,\r\nif all the people who are lost were to complain, there would be a pretty\r\ntumult! Silence is the rule. I have no doubt that heaven imposes silence\r\non the damned, otherwise heaven itself would be punished by their\r\neverlasting cry. The happiness of Olympus is bought by the silence of\r\nCocytus. Then, people, be silent! I do better myself; I approve and\r\nadmire. Just now I was enumerating the lords, and I ought to add to the\r\nlist two archbishops and twenty-four bishops. Truly, I am quite affected\r\nwhen I think of it! I remember to have seen at the tithe-gathering of\r\nthe Rev. Dean of Raphoe, who combined the peerage with the church, a\r\ngreat tithe of beautiful wheat taken from the peasants in the\r\nneighbourhood, and which the dean had not been at the trouble of\r\ngrowing. This left him time to say his prayers. Do you know that Lord\r\nMarmaduke, my master, was Lord Grand Treasurer of Ireland, and High\r\nSeneschal of the sovereignty of Knaresborough in the county of York? Do\r\nyou know that the Lord High Chamberlain, which is an office hereditary\r\nin the family of the Dukes of Ancaster, dresses the king for his\r\ncoronation, and receives for his trouble forty yards of crimson velvet,\r\nbesides the bed on which the king has slept; and that the Usher of the\r\nBlack Rod is his deputy? I should like to see you deny this, that the\r\nsenior viscount of England is Robert Brent, created a viscount by Henry\r\nV. The lords’ titles imply sovereignty over land, except that of Earl\r\nRivers, who takes his title from his family name. How admirable is the\r\nright which they have to tax others, and to levy, for instance, four\r\nshillings in the pound sterling income-tax, which has just been\r\ncontinued for another year! And all the time taxes on distilled spirits,\r\non the excise of wine and beer, on tonnage and poundage, on cider, on\r\nperry, on mum, malt, and prepared barley, on coals, and on a hundred\r\nthings besides. Let us venerate things as they are. The clergy\r\nthemselves depend on the lords. The Bishop of Man is subject to the Earl\r\nof Derby. The lords have wild beasts of their own, which they place in\r\ntheir armorial bearings. God not having made enough, they have invented\r\nothers. They have created the heraldic wild boar, who is as much above\r\nthe wild boar as the wild boar is above the domestic pig and the lord\r\nis above the priest. They have created the griffin, which is an eagle to\r\nlions, and a lion to eagles, terrifying lions by his wings, and eagles\r\nby his mane. They have the guivre, the unicorn, the serpent, the\r\nsalamander, the tarask, the dree, the dragon, and the hippogriff. All\r\nthese things, terrible to us, are to them but an ornament and an\r\nembellishment. They have a menagerie which they call the blazon, in\r\nwhich unknown beasts roar. The prodigies of the forest are nothing\r\ncompared to the inventions of their pride. Their vanity is full of\r\nphantoms which move as in a sublime night, armed with helm and cuirass,\r\nspurs on their heels and the sceptres in their hands, saying in a grave\r\nvoice, ‘We are the ancestors!’ The canker-worms eat the roots, and\r\npanoplies eat the people. Why not? Are we to change the laws? The\r\npeerage is part of the order of society. Do you know that there is a\r\nduke in Scotland who can ride ninety miles without leaving his own\r\nestate? Do you know that the Archbishop of Canterbury has a revenue of\r\n£40,000 a year? Do you know that her Majesty has £700,000 sterling from\r\nthe civil list, besides castles, forests, domains, fiefs, tenancies,\r\nfreeholds, prebendaries, tithes, rent, confiscations, and fines, which\r\nbring in over a million sterling? Those who are not satisfied are hard\r\nto please.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” murmured Gwynplaine sadly, “the paradise of the rich is made out\r\nof the hell of the poor.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nURSUS THE POET DRAGS ON URSUS THE PHILOSOPHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen Dea entered. He looked at her, and saw nothing but her. This is\r\nlove; one may be carried away for a moment by the importunity of some\r\nother idea, but the beloved one enters, and all that does not appertain\r\nto her presence immediately fades away, without her dreaming that\r\nperhaps she is effacing in us a world.\r\n\r\nLet us mention a circumstance. In “Chaos Vanquished,” the word\r\n_monstruo_, addressed to Gwynplaine, displeased Dea. Sometimes, with the\r\nsmattering of Spanish which every one knew at the period, she took it\r\ninto her head to replace it by _quiero_, which signifies, “I wish it.”\r\nUrsus tolerated, although not without an expression of impatience, this\r\nalteration in his text. He might have said to Dea, as in our day\r\nMoessard said to Vissot, _Tu manques de respect au repertoire_.\r\n\r\n“The Laughing Man.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the form of Gwynplaine’s fame. His name, Gwynplaine, little\r\nknown at any time, had disappeared under his nickname, as his face had\r\ndisappeared under its grin.\r\n\r\nHis popularity was like his visage--a mask.\r\n\r\nHis name, however, was to be read on a large placard in front of the\r\nGreen Box, which offered the crowd the following narrative composed by\r\nUrsus:--\r\n\r\n“Here is to be seen Gwynplaine, deserted at the age of ten, on the night\r\nof the 29th of January, 1690, by the villainous Comprachicos, on the\r\ncoast of Portland. The little boy has grown up, and is called now, THE\r\nLAUGHING MAN.”\r\n\r\nThe existence of these mountebanks was as an existence of lepers in a\r\nleper-house, and of the blessed in one of the Pleiades. There was every\r\nday a sudden transition from the noisy exhibition outside, into the most\r\ncomplete seclusion. Every evening they made their exit from this world.\r\nThey were like the dead, vanishing on condition of being reborn next\r\nday. A comedian is a revolving light, appearing one moment, disappearing\r\nthe next, and existing for the public but as a phantom or a light, as\r\nhis life circles round. To exhibition succeeded isolation. When the\r\nperformance was finished, whilst the audience were dispersing, and their\r\nmurmur of satisfaction was dying away in the streets, the Green Box shut\r\nup its platform, as a fortress does its drawbridge, and all\r\ncommunication with mankind was cut off. On one side, the universe; on\r\nthe other, the caravan; and this caravan contained liberty, clear\r\nconsciences, courage, devotion, innocence, happiness, love--all the\r\nconstellations.\r\n\r\nBlindness having sight and deformity beloved sat side by side, hand\r\npressing hand, brow touching brow, and whispered to each other,\r\nintoxicated with love.\r\n\r\nThe compartment in the middle served two purposes--for the public it was\r\na stage, for the actors a dining-room.\r\n\r\nUrsus, ever delighting in comparisons, profited by the diversity of its\r\nuses to liken the central compartment in the Green Box to the arradach\r\nin an Abyssinian hut.\r\n\r\nUrsus counted the receipts, then they supped. In love all is ideal. In\r\nlove, eating and drinking together affords opportunities for many sweet\r\npromiscuous touches, by which a mouthful becomes a kiss. They drank ale\r\nor wine from the same glass, as they might drink dew out of the same\r\nlily. Two souls in love are as full of grace as two birds. Gwynplaine\r\nwaited on Dea, cut her bread, poured out her drink, approached her too\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n“Hum!” cried Ursus, and he turned away, his scolding melting into a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nThe wolf supped under the table, heedless of everything which did\r\nactually not concern his bone.\r\n\r\nFibi and Vinos shared the repast, but gave little trouble. These\r\nvagabonds, half wild and as uncouth as ever, spoke in the gipsy language\r\nto each other.\r\n\r\nAt length Dea re-entered the women’s apartment with Fibi and Vinos.\r\nUrsus chained up Homo under the Green Box; Gwynplaine looked after the\r\nhorses, the lover becoming a groom, like a hero of Homer’s or a paladin\r\nof Charlemagne’s. At midnight, all were asleep, except the wolf, who,\r\nalive to his responsibility, now and then opened an eye. The next\r\nmorning they met again. They breakfasted together, generally on ham and\r\ntea. Tea was introduced into England in 1678. Then Dea, after the\r\nSpanish fashion, took a siesta, acting on the advice of Ursus, who\r\nconsidered her delicate, and slept some hours, while Gwynplaine and\r\nUrsus did all the little jobs of work, without and within, which their\r\nwandering life made necessary. Gwynplaine rarely wandered away from the\r\nGreen Box, except on unfrequented roads and in solitary places. In\r\ncities he went out only at night, disguised in a large, slouched hat, so\r\nas not to exhibit his face in the street.\r\n\r\nHis face was to be seen uncovered only on the stage.\r\n\r\nThe Green Box had frequented cities but little. Gwynplaine at\r\ntwenty-four had never seen towns larger than the Cinque Ports. His\r\nrenown, however, was increasing. It began to rise above the populace,\r\nand to percolate through higher ground. Amongst those who were fond of,\r\nand ran after, strange foreign curiosities and prodigies, it was known\r\nthat there was somewhere in existence, leading a wandering life, now\r\nhere, now there, an extraordinary monster. They talked about him, they\r\nsought him, they asked where he was. The laughing man was becoming\r\ndecidedly famous. A certain lustre was reflected on “Chaos Vanquished.”\r\n\r\nSo much so, that, one day, Ursus, being ambitious, said,--\r\n\r\n“We must go to London.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE THIRD.\r\n\r\n_THE BEGINNING OF THE FISSURE._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE TADCASTER INN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that period London had but one bridge--London Bridge, with houses\r\nbuilt upon it. This bridge united London to Southwark, a suburb which\r\nwas paved with flint pebbles taken from the Thames, divided into small\r\nstreets and alleys, like the City, with a great number of buildings,\r\nhouses, dwellings, and wooden huts jammed together, a pell-mell mixture\r\nof combustible matter, amidst which fire might take its pleasure, as\r\n1666 had proved. Southwark was then pronounced Soudric, it is now\r\npronounced Sousouorc, or near it; indeed, an excellent way of\r\npronouncing English names is not to pronounce them. Thus, for\r\nSouthampton, say Stpntn.\r\n\r\nIt was the time when “Chatham” was pronounced _je t’aime_.\r\n\r\nThe Southwark of those days resembles the Southwark of to-day about as\r\nmuch as Vaugirard resembles Marseilles. It was a village--it is a city.\r\nNevertheless, a considerable trade was carried on there. The long old\r\nCyclopean wall by the Thames was studded with rings, to which were\r\nanchored the river barges.\r\n\r\nThis wall was called the Effroc Wall, or Effroc Stone. York, in Saxon\r\ntimes, was called Effroc. The legend related that a Duke of Effroc had\r\nbeen drowned at the foot of the wall. Certainly the water there was deep\r\nenough to drown a duke. At low water it was six good fathoms. The\r\nexcellence of this little anchorage attracted sea vessels, and the old\r\nDutch tub, called the _Vograat_, came to anchor at the Effroc Stone. The\r\n_Vograat_ made the crossing from London to Rotterdam, and from Rotterdam\r\nto London, punctually once a week. Other barges started twice a day,\r\neither for Deptford, Greenwich, or Gravesend, going down with one tide\r\nand returning with the next. The voyage to Gravesend, though twenty\r\nmiles, was performed in six hours.\r\n\r\nThe _Vograat_ was of a model now no longer to be seen, except in naval\r\nmuseums. It was almost a junk. At that time, while France copied Greece,\r\nHolland copied China. The _Vograat_, a heavy hull with two masts, was\r\npartitioned perpendicularly, so as to be water-tight, having a narrow\r\nhold in the middle, and two decks, one fore and the other aft. The decks\r\nwere flush as in the iron turret-vessels of the present day, the\r\nadvantage of which is that in foul weather, the force of the wave is\r\ndiminished, and the inconvenience of which is that the crew is exposed\r\nto the action of the sea, owing to there being no bulwarks. There was\r\nnothing to save any one on board from falling over. Hence the frequent\r\nfalls overboard and the losses of men, which have caused the model to\r\nfall into disuse. The _Vograat_ went to Holland direct, and did not even\r\ncall at Gravesend.\r\n\r\nAn old ridge of stones, rock as much as masonry, ran along the bottom of\r\nthe Effroc Stone, and being passable at all tides, was used as a passage\r\non board the ships moored to the wall. This wall was, at intervals,\r\nfurnished with steps. It marked the southern point of Southwark. An\r\nembankment at the top allowed the passers-by to rest their elbows on the\r\nEffroc Stone, as on the parapet of a quay. Thence they could look down\r\non the Thames; on the other side of the water London dwindled away into\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nUp the river from the Effroc Stone, at the bend of the Thames which is\r\nnearly opposite St. James’s Palace, behind Lambeth House, not far from\r\nthe walk then called Foxhall (Vauxhall, probably), there was, between a\r\npottery in which they made porcelain, and a glass-blower’s, where they\r\nmade ornamental bottles, one of those large unenclosed spaces covered\r\nwith grass, called formerly in France _cultures_ and _mails_, and in\r\nEngland bowling-greens. Of bowling-green, a green on which to roll a\r\nball, the French have made _boulingrin_. Folks have this green inside\r\ntheir houses nowadays, only it is put on the table, is a cloth instead\r\nof turf, and is called billiards.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to see why, having boulevard (boule-vert), which is the\r\nsame word as bowling-green, the French should have adopted _boulingrin_.\r\nIt is surprising that a person so grave as the Dictionary should indulge\r\nin useless luxuries.\r\n\r\nThe bowling-green of Southwark was called Tarrinzeau Field, because it\r\nhad belonged to the Barons Hastings, who are also Barons Tarrinzeau and\r\nMauchline. From the Lords Hastings the Tarrinzeau Field passed to the\r\nLords Tadcaster, who had made a speculation of it, just as, at a later\r\ndate, a Duke of Orleans made a speculation of the Palais Royal.\r\nTarrinzeau Field afterwards became waste ground and parochial property.\r\n\r\nTarrinzeau Field was a kind of permanent fair ground covered with\r\njugglers, athletes, mountebanks, and music on platforms; and always full\r\nof “fools going to look at the devil,” as Archbishop Sharp said. To look\r\nat the devil means to go to the play.\r\n\r\nSeveral inns, which harboured the public and sent them to these\r\noutlandish exhibitions, were established in this place, which kept\r\nholiday all the year round, and thereby prospered. These inns were\r\nsimply stalls, inhabited only during the day. In the evening the\r\ntavern-keeper put into his pocket the key of the tavern and went away.\r\n\r\nOne only of these inns was a house, the only dwelling in the whole\r\nbowling-green, the caravans of the fair ground having the power of\r\ndisappearing at any moment, considering the absence of any ties in the\r\nvagabond life of all mountebanks.\r\n\r\nMountebanks have no roots to their lives.\r\n\r\nThis inn, called the Tadcaster, after the former owners of the ground,\r\nwas an inn rather than a tavern, an hotel rather than an inn, and had a\r\ncarriage entrance and a large yard.\r\n\r\nThe carriage entrance, opening from the court on the field, was the\r\nlegitimate door of the Tadcaster Inn, which had, beside it, a small\r\nbastard door, by which people entered. To call it bastard is to mean\r\npreferred. This lower door was the only one used, It opened into the\r\ntavern, properly so called, which was a large taproom, full of tobacco\r\nsmoke, furnished with tables, and low in the ceiling. Over it was a\r\nwindow on the first floor, to the iron bars of which was fastened and\r\nhung the sign of the inn. The principal door was barred and bolted, and\r\nalways remained closed.\r\n\r\nIt was thus necessary to cross the tavern to enter the courtyard.\r\n\r\nAt the Tadcaster Inn there was a landlord and a boy. The landlord was\r\ncalled Master Nicless, the boy Govicum. Master Nicless--Nicholas,\r\ndoubtless, which the English habit of contraction had made Nicless, was\r\na miserly widower, and one who respected and feared the laws. As to his\r\nappearance, he had bushy eyebrows and hairy hands. The boy, aged\r\nfourteen, who poured out drink, and answered to the name of Govicum,\r\nwore a merry face and an apron. His hair was cropped close, a sign of\r\nservitude.\r\n\r\nHe slept on the ground floor, in a nook in which they formerly kept a\r\ndog. This nook had for window a bull’s-eye looking on the bowling-green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOPEN-AIR ELOQUENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne very cold and windy evening, on which there was every reason why\r\nfolks should hasten on their way along the street, a man, who was\r\nwalking in Tarrinzeau Field close under the walls of the tavern, stopped\r\nsuddenly. It was during the last months of winter between 1704 and 1705.\r\nThis man, whose dress indicated a sailor, was of good mien and fine\r\nfigure, things imperative to courtiers, and not forbidden to common\r\nfolk.\r\n\r\nWhy did he stop? To listen. What to? To a voice apparently speaking in\r\nthe court on the other side of the wall, a voice a little weakened by\r\nage, but so powerful notwithstanding that it reached the passer-by in\r\nthe street. At the same time might be heard in the enclosure, from which\r\nthe voice came, the hubbub of a crowd.\r\n\r\nThis voice said,--\r\n\r\n“Men and women of London, here I am! I cordially wish you joy of being\r\nEnglish. You are a great people. I say more: you are a great populace.\r\nYour fisticuffs are even better than your sword thrusts. You have an\r\nappetite. You are the nation which eats other nations--a magnificent\r\nfunction! This suction of the world makes England preeminent. As\r\npoliticians and philosophers, in the management of colonies,\r\npopulations, and industry, and in the desire to do others any harm which\r\nmay turn to your own good, you stand alone. The hour will come when two\r\nboards will be put up on earth--inscribed on one side, Men; on the\r\nother, Englishmen. I mention this to your glory, I, who am neither\r\nEnglish nor human, having the honour to be a bear. Still more--I am a\r\ndoctor. That follows. Gentlemen, I teach. What? Two kinds of\r\nthings--things which I know, and things which I do not. I sell my drugs\r\nand I sell my ideas. Approach and listen. Science invites you. Open your\r\near; if it is small, it will hold but little truth; if large, a great\r\ndeal of folly will find its way in. Now, then, attention! I teach the\r\nPseudoxia Epidemica. I have a comrade who will make you laugh, but I can\r\nmake you think. We live in the same box, laughter being of quite as old\r\na family as thought. When people asked Democritus, ‘How do you know?’ he\r\nanswered, ‘I laugh.’ And if I am asked, ‘Why do you laugh?’ I shall\r\nanswer, ‘I know.’ However, I am not laughing. I am the rectifier of\r\npopular errors. I take upon myself the task of cleaning your intellects.\r\nThey require it. Heaven permits people to deceive themselves, and to be\r\ndeceived. It is useless to be absurdly modest. I frankly avow that I\r\nbelieve in Providence, even where it is wrong. Only when I see\r\nfilth--errors are filth--I sweep them away. How am I sure of what I\r\nknow? That concerns only myself. Every one catches wisdom as he can.\r\nLactantius asked questions of, and received answers from, a bronze head\r\nof Virgil. Sylvester II. conversed with birds. Did the birds speak? Did\r\nthe Pope twitter? That is a question. The dead child of the Rabbi\r\nElcazer talked to Saint Augustine. Between ourselves, I doubt all these\r\nfacts except the last. The dead child might perhaps talk, because under\r\nits tongue it had a gold plate, on which were engraved divers\r\nconstellations. Thus he deceived people. The fact explains itself. You\r\nsee my moderation. I separate the true from the false. See! here are\r\nother errors in which, no doubt, you partake, poor ignorant folks that\r\nyou are, and from which I wish to free you. Dioscorides believed that\r\nthere was a god in the henbane; Chrysippus in the cynopaste; Josephus in\r\nthe root bauras; Homer in the plant moly. They were all wrong. The\r\nspirits in herbs are not gods but devils. I have tested this fact. It is\r\nnot true that the serpent which tempted Eve had a human face, as Cadmus\r\nrelates. Garcias de Horto, Cadamosto, and John Hugo, Archbishop of\r\nTreves, deny that it is sufficient to saw down a tree to catch an\r\nelephant. I incline to their opinion. Citizens, the efforts of Lucifer\r\nare the cause of all false impressions. Under the reign of such a prince\r\nit is natural that meteors of error and of perdition should arise. My\r\nfriends, Claudius Pulcher did not die because the fowls refused to come\r\nout of the fowl house. The fact is, that Lucifer, having foreseen the\r\ndeath of Claudius Pulcher, took care to prevent the birds feeding. That\r\nBeelzebub gave the Emperor Vespasian the virtue of curing the lame and\r\ngiving sight to the blind, by his touch, was an act praiseworthy in\r\nitself, but of which the motive was culpable. Gentlemen, distrust those\r\nfalse doctors, who sell the root of the bryony and the white snake, and\r\nwho make washes with honey and the blood of a cock. See clearly through\r\nthat which is false. It is not quite true that Orion was the result of a\r\nnatural function of Jupiter. The truth is that it was Mercury who\r\nproduced this star in that way. It is not true that Adam had a navel.\r\nWhen St. George killed the dragon he had not the daughter of a saint\r\nstanding by his side. St. Jerome had not a clock on the chimney-piece of\r\nhis study; first, because living in a cave, he had no study; secondly,\r\nbecause he had no chimney-piece; thirdly, because clocks were not yet\r\ninvented. Let us put these things right. Put them right. O gentlefolks,\r\nwho listen to me, if any one tells you that a lizard will be born in\r\nyour head if you smell the herb valerian; that the rotting carcase of\r\nthe ox changes into bees, and that of the horse into hornets; that a man\r\nweighs more when dead than when alive; that the blood of the he-goat\r\ndissolves emeralds; that a caterpillar, a fly, and a spider, seen on the\r\nsame tree, announces famine, war, and pestilence; that the falling\r\nsickness is to be cured by a worm found in the head of a buck--do not\r\nbelieve him. These things are errors. But now listen to truths. The skin\r\nof a sea-calf is a safeguard against thunder. The toad feeds upon earth,\r\nwhich causes a stone to come into his head. The rose of Jericho blooms\r\non Christmas Eve. Serpents cannot endure the shadow of the ash tree. The\r\nelephant has no joints, and sleeps resting upright against a tree. Make\r\na toad sit upon a cock’s egg, and he will hatch a scorpion which will\r\nbecome a salamander. A blind person will recover sight by putting one\r\nhand on the left side of the altar and the other on his eyes. Virginity\r\ndoes not hinder maternity. Honest people, lay these truths to heart.\r\nAbove all, you can believe in Providence in either of two ways, either\r\nas thirst believes in the orange, or as the ass believes in the whip.\r\nNow I am going to introduce you to my family.”\r\n\r\nHere a violent gust of wind shook the window-frames and shutters of the\r\ninn, which stood detached. It was like a prolonged murmur of the sky.\r\nThe orator paused a moment, and then resumed.\r\n\r\n“An interruption; very good. Speak, north wind. Gentlemen, I am not\r\nangry. The wind is loquacious, like all solitary creatures. There is no\r\none to keep him company up there, so he jabbers. I resume the thread of\r\nmy discourse. Here you see associated artists. We are four--_a lupo\r\nprincipium_. I begin by my friend, who is a wolf. He does not conceal\r\nit. See him! He is educated, grave, and sagacious. Providence, perhaps,\r\nentertained for a moment the idea of making him a doctor of the\r\nuniversity; but for that one must be rather stupid, and that he is not.\r\nI may add that he has no prejudices, and is not aristocratic. He chats\r\nsometimes with bitches; he who, by right, should consort only with\r\nshe-wolves. His heirs, if he have any, will no doubt gracefully combine\r\nthe yap of their mother with the howl of their father. Because he does\r\nhowl. He howls in sympathy with men. He barks as well, in condescension\r\nto civilization--a magnanimous concession. Homo is a dog made perfect.\r\nLet us venerate the dog. The dog--curious animal! sweats with its tongue\r\nand smiles with its tail. Gentlemen, Homo equals in wisdom, and\r\nsurpasses in cordiality, the hairless wolf of Mexico, the wonderful\r\nxoloïtzeniski. I may add that he is humble. He has the modesty of a wolf\r\nwho is useful to men. He is helpful and charitable, and says nothing\r\nabout it. His left paw knows not the good which his right paw does.\r\nThese are his merits. Of the other, my second friend, I have but one\r\nword to say. He is a monster. You will admire him. He was formerly\r\nabandoned by pirates on the shores of the wild ocean. This third one is\r\nblind. Is she an exception? No, we are all blind. The miser is blind; he\r\nsees gold, and he does not see riches. The prodigal is blind; he sees\r\nthe beginning, and does not see the end. The coquette is blind; she does\r\nnot see her wrinkles. The learned man is blind; he does not see his own\r\nignorance. The honest man is blind; he does not see the thief. The thief\r\nis blind; he does not see God. God is blind; the day that he created the\r\nworld He did not see the devil manage to creep into it. I myself am\r\nblind; I speak, and do not see that you are deaf. This blind girl who\r\naccompanies us is a mysterious priestess. Vesta has confided to her her\r\ntorch. She has in her character depths as soft as a division in the wool\r\nof a sheep. I believe her to be a king’s daughter, though I do not\r\nassert it as a fact. A laudable distrust is the attribute of wisdom. For\r\nmy own part, I reason and I doctor, I think and I heal. _Chirurgus sum_.\r\nI cure fevers, miasmas, and plagues. Almost all our melancholy and\r\nsufferings are issues, which if carefully treated relieve us quietly\r\nfrom other evils which might be worse. All the same I do not recommend\r\nyou to have an anthrax, otherwise called carbuncle. It is a stupid\r\nmalady, and serves no good end. One dies of it--that is all. I am\r\nneither uncultivated nor rustic. I honour eloquence and poetry, and live\r\nin an innocent union with these goddesses. I conclude by a piece of\r\nadvice. Ladies and gentlemen, on the sunny side of your dispositions,\r\ncultivate virtue, modesty, honesty, probity, justice, and love. Each one\r\nhere below may thus have his little pot of flowers on his window-sill.\r\nMy lords and gentlemen, I have spoken. The play is about to begin.”\r\n\r\nThe man who was apparently a sailor, and who had been listening outside,\r\nentered the lower room of the inn, crossed it, paid the necessary\r\nentrance money, reached the courtyard which was full of people, saw at\r\nthe bottom of it a caravan on wheels, wide open, and on the platform an\r\nold man dressed in a bearskin, a young man looking like a mask, a blind\r\ngirl, and a wolf.\r\n\r\n“Gracious heaven!” he cried, “what delightful people!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWHERE THE PASSER-BY REAPPEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Green Box, as we have just seen, had arrived in London. It was\r\nestablished at Southwark. Ursus had been tempted by the bowling-green,\r\nwhich had one great recommendation, that it was always fair-day there,\r\neven in winter.\r\n\r\nThe dome of St. Paul’s was a delight to Ursus.\r\n\r\nLondon, take it all in all, has some good in it. It was a brave thing to\r\ndedicate a cathedral to St. Paul. The real cathedral saint is St. Peter.\r\nSt. Paul is suspected of imagination, and in matters ecclesiastical\r\nimagination means heresy. St. Paul is a saint only with extenuating\r\ncircumstances. He entered heaven only by the artists’ door.\r\n\r\nA cathedral is a sign. St. Peter is the sign of Rome, the city of the\r\ndogma; St. Paul that of London, the city of schism.\r\n\r\nUrsus, whose philosophy had arms so long that it embraced everything,\r\nwas a man who appreciated these shades of difference, and his attraction\r\ntowards London arose, perhaps, from a certain taste of his for St. Paul.\r\n\r\nThe yard of the Tadcaster Inn had taken the fancy of Ursus. It might\r\nhave been ordered for the Green Box. It was a theatre ready-made. It was\r\nsquare, with three sides built round, and a wall forming the fourth.\r\nAgainst this wall was placed the Green Box, which they were able to draw\r\ninto the yard, owing to the height of the gate. A large wooden balcony,\r\nroofed over, and supported on posts, on which the rooms of the first\r\nstory opened, ran round the three fronts of the interior façade of the\r\nhouse, making two right angles. The windows of the ground floor made\r\nboxes, the pavement of the court the pit, and the balcony the gallery.\r\nThe Green Box, reared against the wall, was thus in front of a theatre.\r\nIt was very like the Globe, where they played “Othello,” “King Lear,”\r\nand “The Tempest.”\r\n\r\nIn a corner behind the Green Box was a stable.\r\n\r\nUrsus had made his arrangements with the tavern keeper, Master Nicless,\r\nwho, owing to his respect for the law, would not admit the wolf without\r\ncharging him extra.\r\n\r\nThe placard, “Gwynplaine, the Laughing Man,” taken from its nail in the\r\nGreen Box, was hung up close to the sign of the inn. The sitting-room of\r\nthe tavern had, as we have seen, an inside door which opened into the\r\ncourt. By the side of the door was constructed off-hand, by means of an\r\nempty barrel, a box for the money-taker, who was sometimes Fibi and\r\nsometimes Vinos. This was managed much as at present. Pay and pass in.\r\nUnder the placard announcing the Laughing Man was a piece of wood,\r\npainted white, hung on two nails, on which was written in charcoal in\r\nlarge letters the title of Ursus’s grand piece, “Chaos Vanquished.”\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the balcony, precisely opposite the Green Box, and in a\r\ncompartment having for entrance a window reaching to the ground, there\r\nhad been partitioned off a space “for the nobility.” It was large enough\r\nto hold, in two rows, ten spectators.\r\n\r\n“We are in London,” said Ursus. “We must be prepared for the gentry.”\r\n\r\nHe had furnished this box with the best chairs in the inn, and had\r\nplaced in the centre a grand arm-chair of yellow Utrecht velvet, with a\r\ncherry-coloured pattern, in case some alderman’s wife should come.\r\n\r\nThey began their performances. The crowd immediately flocked to them,\r\nbut the compartment for the nobility remained empty. With that exception\r\ntheir success became so great that no mountebank memory could recall its\r\nparallel. All Southwark ran in crowds to admire the Laughing Man.\r\n\r\nThe merry-andrews and mountebanks of Tarrinzeau Field were aghast at\r\nGwynplaine. The effect he caused was as that of a sparrow-hawk flapping\r\nhis wings in a cage of goldfinches, and feeding in their seed-trough.\r\nGwynplaine ate up their public.\r\n\r\nBesides the small fry, the swallowers of swords and the grimace makers,\r\nreal performances took place on the green. There was a circus of women,\r\nringing from morning till night with a magnificent peal of all sorts of\r\ninstruments--psalteries, drums, rebecks, micamons, timbrels, reeds,\r\ndulcimers, gongs, chevrettes, bagpipes, German horns, English\r\neschaqueils, pipes, flutes, and flageolets.\r\n\r\nIn a large round tent were some tumblers, who could not have equalled\r\nour present climbers of the Pyrenees--Dulma, Bordenave, and\r\nMeylonga--who from the peak of Pierrefitte descend to the plateau of\r\nLimaçon, an almost perpendicular height. There was a travelling\r\nmenagerie, where was to be seen a performing tiger, who, lashed by the\r\nkeeper, snapped at the whip and tried to swallow the lash. Even this\r\ncomedian of jaws and claws was eclipsed in success.\r\n\r\nCuriosity, applause, receipts, crowds, the Laughing Man monopolized\r\neverything. It happened in the twinkling of an eye. Nothing was thought\r\nof but the Green Box.\r\n\r\n“‘Chaos Vanquished’ is ‘Chaos Victor,’” said Ursus, appropriating half\r\nGwynplaine’s success, and taking the wind out of his sails, as they say\r\nat sea. That success was prodigious. Still it remained local. Fame does\r\nnot cross the sea easily. It took a hundred and thirty years for the\r\nname of Shakespeare to penetrate from England into France. The sea is a\r\nwall; and if Voltaire--a thing which he very much regretted when it was\r\ntoo late--had not thrown a bridge over to Shakespeare, Shakespeare might\r\nstill be in England, on the other side of the wall, a captive in insular\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nThe glory of Gwynplaine had not passed London Bridge. It was not great\r\nenough yet to re-echo throughout the city. At least not at first. But\r\nSouthwark ought to have sufficed to satisfy the ambition of a clown.\r\nUrsus said,--\r\n\r\n“The money bag grows palpably bigger.”\r\n\r\nThey played “Ursus Rursus” and “Chaos Vanquished.”\r\n\r\nBetween the acts Ursus exhibited his power as an engastrimist, and\r\nexecuted marvels of ventriloquism. He imitated every cry which occurred\r\nin the audience--a song, a cry, enough to startle, so exact the\r\nimitation, the singer or the crier himself; and now and then he copied\r\nthe hubbub of the public, and whistled as if there were a crowd of\r\npeople within him. These were remarkable talents. Besides this he\r\nharangued like Cicero, as we have just seen, sold his drugs, attended\r\nsickness, and even healed the sick.\r\n\r\nSouthwark was enthralled.\r\n\r\nUrsus was satisfied with the applause of Southwark, but by no means\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\n“They are the ancient Trinobantes,” he said.\r\n\r\nThen he added, “I must not mistake them, for delicacy of taste, for the\r\nAtrobates, who people Berkshire, or the Belgians, who inhabited\r\nSomersetshire, nor for the Parisians, who founded York.”\r\n\r\nAt every performance the yard of the inn, transformed into a pit, was\r\nfilled with a ragged and enthusiastic audience. It was composed of\r\nwatermen, chairmen, coachmen, and bargemen, and sailors, just ashore,\r\nspending their wages in feasting and women. In it there were felons,\r\nruffians, and blackguards, who were soldiers condemned for some crime\r\nagainst discipline to wear their red coats, which were lined with black,\r\ninside out, and from thence the name of blackguard, which the French\r\nturn into _blagueurs_. All these flowed from the street into the\r\ntheatre, and poured back from the theatre into the tap. The emptying of\r\ntankards did not decrease their success.\r\n\r\nAmidst what it is usual to call the scum, there was one taller than the\r\nrest, bigger, stronger, less poverty-stricken, broader in the shoulders;\r\ndressed like the common people, but not ragged.\r\n\r\nAdmiring and applauding everything to the skies, clearing his way with\r\nhis fists, wearing a disordered periwig, swearing, shouting, joking,\r\nnever dirty, and, at need, ready to blacken an eye or pay for a bottle.\r\n\r\nThis frequenter was the passer-by whose cheer of enthusiasm has been\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nThis connoisseur was suddenly fascinated, and had adopted the Laughing\r\nMan. He did not come every evening, but when he came he led the\r\npublic--applause grew into acclamation--success rose not to the roof,\r\nfor there was none, but to the clouds, for there were plenty of them.\r\nWhich clouds (seeing that there was no roof) sometimes wept over the\r\nmasterpiece of Ursus.\r\n\r\nHis enthusiasm caused Ursus to remark this man, and Gwynplaine to\r\nobserve him.\r\n\r\nThey had a great friend in this unknown visitor.\r\n\r\nUrsus and Gwynplaine wanted to know him; at least, to know who he was.\r\n\r\nOne evening Ursus was in the side scene, which was the kitchen-door of\r\nthe Green Box, seeing Master Nicless standing by him, showed him this\r\nman in the crowd, and asked him,--\r\n\r\n“Do you know that man?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I do.”\r\n\r\n“Who is he?”\r\n\r\n“A sailor.”\r\n\r\n“What is his name?” said Gwynplaine, interrupting.\r\n\r\n“Tom-Jim-Jack,” replied the inn-keeper.\r\n\r\nThen as he redescended the steps at the back of the Green Box, to enter\r\nthe inn, Master Nicless let fall this profound reflection, so deep as to\r\nbe unintelligible,--\r\n\r\n“What a pity that he should not be a lord. He would make a famous\r\nscoundrel.”\r\n\r\nOtherwise, although established in the tavern, the group in the Green\r\nBox had in no way altered their manner of living, and held to their\r\nisolated habits. Except a few words exchanged now and then with the\r\ntavern-keeper, they held no communication with any of those who were\r\nliving, either permanently or temporarily, in the inn; and continued to\r\nkeep to themselves.\r\n\r\nSince they had been at Southwark, Gwynplaine had made it his habit,\r\nafter the performance and the supper of both family and horses--when\r\nUrsus and Dea had gone to bed in their respective compartments--to\r\nbreathe a little the fresh air of the bowling-green, between eleven\r\no’clock and midnight.\r\n\r\nA certain vagrancy in our spirits impels us to take walks at night, and\r\nto saunter under the stars. There is a mysterious expectation in youth.\r\nTherefore it is that we are prone to wander out in the night, without an\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nAt that hour there was no one in the fair-ground, except, perhaps, some\r\nreeling drunkard, making staggering shadows in dark corners. The empty\r\ntaverns were shut up, and the lower room in the Tadcaster Inn was dark,\r\nexcept where, in some corner, a solitary candle lighted a last reveller.\r\nAn indistinct glow gleamed through the window-shutters of the\r\nhalf-closed tavern, as Gwynplaine, pensive, content, and dreaming, happy\r\nin a haze of divine joy, passed backwards and forwards in front of the\r\nhalf-open door.\r\n\r\nOf what was he thinking? Of Dea--of nothing--of everything--of the\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\nHe never wandered far from the Green Box, being held, as by a thread, to\r\nDea. A few steps away from it was far enough for him.\r\n\r\nThen he returned, found the whole Green Box asleep, and went to bed\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCONTRARIES FRATERNIZE IN HATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuccess is hateful, especially to those whom it overthrows. It is rare\r\nthat the eaten adore the eaters.\r\n\r\nThe Laughing Man had decidedly made a hit. The mountebanks around were\r\nindignant. A theatrical success is a syphon--it pumps in the crowd and\r\ncreates emptiness all round. The shop opposite is done for. The\r\nincreased receipts of the Green Box caused a corresponding decrease in\r\nthe receipts of the surrounding shows. Those entertainments, popular up\r\nto that time, suddenly collapsed. It was like a low-water mark, showing\r\ninversely, but in perfect concordance, the rise here, the fall there.\r\nTheatres experience the effect of tides: they rise in one only on\r\ncondition of falling in another. The swarming foreigners who exhibited\r\ntheir talents and their trumpetings on the neighbouring platforms,\r\nseeing themselves ruined by the Laughing Man, were despairing, yet\r\ndazzled. All the grimacers, all the clowns, all the merry-andrews envied\r\nGwynplaine. How happy he must be with the snout of a wild beast! The\r\nbuffoon mothers and dancers on the tight-rope, with pretty children,\r\nlooked at them in anger, and pointing out Gwynplaine, would say, “What a\r\npity you have not a face like that!” Some beat their babes savagely for\r\nbeing pretty. More than one, had she known the secret, would have\r\nfashioned her son’s face in the Gwynplaine style. The head of an angel,\r\nwhich brings no money in, is not as good as that of a lucrative devil.\r\nOne day the mother of a little child who was a marvel of beauty, and who\r\nacted a cupid, exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“Our children are failures! They only succeeded with Gwynplaine.” And\r\nshaking her fist at her son, she added, “If I only knew your father,\r\nwouldn’t he catch it!”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine was the goose with the golden eggs! What a marvellous\r\nphenomenon! There was an uproar through all the caravans. The\r\nmountebanks, enthusiastic and exasperated, looked at Gwynplaine and\r\ngnashed their teeth. Admiring anger is called envy. Then it howls! They\r\ntried to disturb “Chaos Vanquished;” made a cabal, hissed, scolded,\r\nshouted! This was an excuse for Ursus to make out-of-door harangues to\r\nthe populace, and for his friend Tom-Jim-Jack to use his fists to\r\nre-establish order. His pugilistic marks of friendship brought him still\r\nmore under the notice and regard of Ursus and Gwynplaine. At a distance,\r\nhowever, for the group in the Green Box sufficed to themselves, and held\r\naloof from the rest of the world, and because Tom-Jim-Jack, this leader\r\nof the mob, seemed a sort of supreme bully, without a tie, without a\r\nfriend; a smasher of windows, a manager of men, now here, now gone,\r\nhail-fellow-well-met with every one, companion of none.\r\n\r\nThis raging envy against Gwynplaine did not give in for a few friendly\r\nhits from Tom-Jim-Jack. The outcries having miscarried, the mountebanks\r\nof Tarrinzeau Field fell back on a petition. They addressed to the\r\nauthorities. This is the usual course. Against an unpleasant success we\r\nfirst try to stir up the crowd and then we petition the magistrate.\r\n\r\nWith the merry-andrews the reverends allied themselves. The Laughing Man\r\nhad inflicted a blow on the preachers. There were empty places not only\r\nin the caravans, but in the churches. The congregations in the churches\r\nof the five parishes in Southwark had dwindled away. People left before\r\nthe sermon to go to Gwynplaine. “Chaos Vanquished,” the Green Box, the\r\nLaughing Man, all the abominations of Baal, eclipsed the eloquence of\r\nthe pulpit. The voice crying in the desert, _vox clamantis in deserto_,\r\nis discontented, and is prone to call for the aid of the authorities.\r\nThe clergy of the five parishes complained to the Bishop of London, who\r\ncomplained to her Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe complaint of the merry-andrews was based on religion. They declared\r\nit to be insulted. They described Gwynplaine as a sorcerer, and Ursus as\r\nan atheist. The reverend gentlemen invoked social order. Setting\r\northodoxy aside they took action on the fact that Acts of Parliament\r\nwere violated. It was clever. Because it was the period of Mr. Locke,\r\nwho had died but six months previously--28th October, 1704--and when\r\nscepticism, which Bolingbroke had imbibed from Voltaire, was taking\r\nroot. Later on Wesley came and restored the Bible, as Loyola restored\r\nthe papacy.\r\n\r\nThus the Green Box was battered on both sides; by the merry-andrews, in\r\nthe name of the Pentateuch, and by chaplains in the name of the police.\r\nIn the name of Heaven and of the inspectors of nuisances. The Green Box\r\nwas denounced by the priests as an obstruction, and by the jugglers as\r\nsacrilegious.\r\n\r\nHad they any pretext? Was there any excuse? Yes. What was the crime?\r\nThis: there was the wolf. A dog was allowable; a wolf forbidden. In\r\nEngland the wolf is an outlaw. England admits the dog which barks, but\r\nnot the dog which howls--a shade of difference between the yard and the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nThe rectors and vicars of the five parishes of Southwark called\r\nattention in their petitions to numerous parliamentary and royal\r\nstatutes putting the wolf beyond the protection of the law. They moved\r\nfor something like the imprisonment of Gwynplaine and the execution of\r\nthe wolf, or at any rate for their banishment. The question was one of\r\npublic importance, the danger to persons passing, etc. And on this\r\npoint, they appealed to the Faculty. They cited the opinion of the\r\nEighty physicians of London, a learned body which dates from Henry\r\nVIII., which has a seal like that of the State, which can raise sick\r\npeople to the dignity of being amenable to their jurisdiction, which has\r\nthe right to imprison those who infringe its law and contravene its\r\nordinances, and which, amongst other useful regulations for the health\r\nof the citizens, put beyond doubt this fact acquired by science; that if\r\na wolf sees a man first, the man becomes hoarse for life. Besides, he\r\nmay be bitten.\r\n\r\nHomo, then, was a pretext.\r\n\r\nUrsus heard of these designs through the inn-keeper. He was uneasy. He\r\nwas afraid of two claws--the police and the justices. To be afraid of\r\nthe magistracy, it is sufficient to be afraid, there is no need to be\r\nguilty. Ursus had no desire for contact with sheriffs, provosts,\r\nbailiffs, and coroners. His eagerness to make their acquaintance\r\namounted to nil. His curiosity to see the magistrates was about as great\r\nas the hare’s to see the greyhound.\r\n\r\nHe began to regret that he had come to London. “‘Better’ is the enemy of\r\n‘good,’” murmured he apart. “I thought the proverb was ill-considered. I\r\nwas wrong. Stupid truths are true truths.”\r\n\r\nAgainst the coalition of powers--merry-andrews taking in hand the cause\r\nof religion, and chaplains, indignant in the name of medicine--the poor\r\nGreen Box, suspected of sorcery in Gwynplaine and of hydrophobia in\r\nHomo, had only one thing in its favour (but a thing of great power in\r\nEngland), municipal inactivity. It is to the local authorities letting\r\nthings take their own course that Englishmen owe their liberty. Liberty\r\nin England behaves very much as the sea around England. It is a tide.\r\nLittle by little manners surmount the law. A cruel system of legislation\r\ndrowned under the wave of custom; a savage code of laws still visible\r\nthrough the transparency of universal liberty: such is England.\r\n\r\nThe Laughing Man, “Chaos Vanquished,” and Homo might have mountebanks,\r\npreachers, bishops, the House of Commons, the House of Lords, her\r\nMajesty, London, and the whole of England against them, and remain\r\nundisturbed so long as Southwark permitted.\r\n\r\nThe Green Box was the favourite amusement of the suburb, and the local\r\nauthorities seemed disinclined to interfere. In England, indifference is\r\nprotection. So long as the sheriff of the county of Surrey, to the\r\njurisdiction of which Southwark belongs, did not move in the matter,\r\nUrsus breathed freely, and Homo could sleep on his wolf’s ears.\r\n\r\nSo long as the hatred which it excited did not occasion acts of\r\nviolence, it increased success. The Green Box was none the worse for it,\r\nfor the time. On the contrary, hints were scattered that it contained\r\nsomething mysterious. Hence the Laughing Man became more and more\r\npopular. The public follow with gusto the scent of anything contraband.\r\nTo be suspected is a recommendation. The people adopt by instinct that\r\nat which the finger is pointed. The thing which is denounced is like the\r\nsavour of forbidden fruit; we rush to eat it. Besides, applause which\r\nirritates some one, especially if that some one is in authority, is\r\nsweet. To perform, whilst passing a pleasant evening, both an act of\r\nkindness to the oppressed and of opposition to the oppressor is\r\nagreeable. You are protecting at the same time that you are being\r\namused. So the theatrical caravans on the bowling-green continued to\r\nhowl and to cabal against the Laughing Man. Nothing could be better\r\ncalculated to enhance his success. The shouts of one’s enemies are\r\nuseful and give point and vitality to one’s triumph. A friend wearies\r\nsooner in praise than an enemy in abuse. To abuse does not hurt. Enemies\r\nare ignorant of this fact. They cannot help insulting us, and this\r\nconstitutes their use. They cannot hold their tongues, and thus keep the\r\npublic awake.\r\n\r\nThe crowds which flocked to “Chaos Vanquished” increased daily.\r\n\r\nUrsus kept what Master Nicless had said of intriguers and complaints in\r\nhigh places to himself, and did not tell Gwynplaine, lest it should\r\ntrouble the ease of his acting by creating anxiety. If evil was to come,\r\nhe would be sure to know it soon enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE WAPENTAKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce, however, he thought it his duty to derogate from this prudence,\r\nfor prudence’ sake, thinking that it might be well to make Gwynplaine\r\nuneasy. It is true that this idea arose from a circumstance much graver,\r\nin the opinion of Ursus, than the cabals of the fair or of the church.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, as he picked up a farthing which had fallen when counting\r\nthe receipts, had, in the presence of the innkeeper, drawn a contrast\r\nbetween the farthing, representing the misery of the people, and the\r\ndie, representing, under the figure of Anne, the parasitical\r\nmagnificence of the throne--an ill-sounding speech. This observation was\r\nrepeated by Master Nicless, and had such a run that it reached to Ursus\r\nthrough Fibi and Vinos. It put Ursus into a fever. Seditious words, lèse\r\nMajesté. He took Gwynplaine severely to task. “Watch over your\r\nabominable jaws. There is a rule for the great--to do nothing; and a\r\nrule for the small--to say nothing. The poor man has but one friend,\r\nsilence. He should only pronounce one syllable: ‘Yes.’ To confess and to\r\nconsent is all the right he has. ‘Yes,’ to the judge; ‘yes,’ to the\r\nking. Great people, if it pleases them to do so, beat us. I have\r\nreceived blows from them. It is their prerogative; and they lose nothing\r\nof their greatness by breaking our bones. The ossifrage is a species of\r\neagle. Let us venerate the sceptre, which is the first of staves.\r\nRespect is prudence, and mediocrity is safety. To insult the king is to\r\nput oneself in the same danger as a girl rashly paring the nails of a\r\nlion. They tell me that you have been prattling about the farthing,\r\nwhich is the same thing as the liard, and that you have found fault with\r\nthe august medallion, for which they sell us at market the eighth part\r\nof a salt herring. Take care; let us be serious. Consider the existence\r\nof pains and penalties. Suck in these legislative truths. You are in a\r\ncountry in which the man who cuts down a tree three years old is quietly\r\ntaken off to the gallows. As to swearers, their feet are put into the\r\nstocks. The drunkard is shut up in a barrel with the bottom out, so that\r\nhe can walk, with a hole in the top, through which his head is passed,\r\nand with two in the bung for his hands, so that he cannot lie down. He\r\nwho strikes another one in Westminster Hall is imprisoned for life and\r\nhas his goods confiscated. Whoever strikes any one in the king’s palace\r\nhas his hand struck off. A fillip on the nose chances to bleed, and,\r\nbehold! you are maimed for life. He who is convicted of heresy in the\r\nbishop’s court is burnt alive. It was for no great matter that Cuthbert\r\nSimpson was quartered on a turnstile. Three years since, in 1702, which\r\nis not long ago, you see, they placed in the pillory a scoundrel, called\r\nDaniel Defoe, who had had the audacity to print the names of the Members\r\nof Parliament who had spoken on the previous evening. He who commits\r\nhigh treason is disembowelled alive, and they tear out his heart and\r\nbuffet his cheeks with it. Impress on yourself notions of right and\r\njustice. Never allow yourself to speak a word, and at the first cause of\r\nanxiety, run for it. Such is the bravery which I counsel and which I\r\npractise. In the way of temerity, imitate the birds; in the way of\r\ntalking, imitate the fishes. England has one admirable point in her\r\nfavour, that her legislation is very mild.”\r\n\r\nHis admonition over, Ursus remained uneasy for some time. Gwynplaine not\r\nat all. The intrepidity of youth arises from want of experience.\r\nHowever, it seemed that Gwynplaine had good reason for his easy mind,\r\nfor the weeks flowed on peacefully, and no bad consequences seemed to\r\nhave resulted from his observations about the queen.\r\n\r\nUrsus, we know, lacked apathy, and, like a roebuck on the watch, kept a\r\nlookout in every direction. One day, a short time after his sermon to\r\nGwynplaine, as he was looking out from the window in the wall which\r\ncommanded the field, he became suddenly pale.\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Look.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“In the field.”\r\n\r\n“Well.”\r\n\r\n“Do you see that passer-by?”\r\n\r\n“The man in black?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Who has a kind of mace in his hand?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Well, Gwynplaine, that man is a wapentake.”\r\n\r\n“What is a wapentake?”\r\n\r\n“He is the bailiff of the hundred.”\r\n\r\n“What is the bailiff of the hundred?”\r\n\r\n“He is the _proepositus hundredi_.”\r\n\r\n“And what is the _proepositus hundredi_?”\r\n\r\n“He is a terrible officer.”\r\n\r\n“What has he got in his hand?”\r\n\r\n“The iron weapon.”\r\n\r\n“What is the iron weapon?”\r\n\r\n“A thing made of iron.”\r\n\r\n“What does he do with that?”\r\n\r\n“First of all, he swears upon it. It is for that reason that he is\r\ncalled the wapentake.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“Then he touches you with it.”\r\n\r\n“With what?”\r\n\r\n“With the iron weapon.”\r\n\r\n“The wapentake touches you with the iron weapon?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What does that mean?”\r\n\r\n“That means, follow me.”\r\n\r\n“And must you follow?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Whither?”\r\n\r\n“How should I know?”\r\n\r\n“But he tells you where he is going to take you?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“How is that?”\r\n\r\n“He says nothing, and you say nothing.”\r\n\r\n“But--”\r\n\r\n“He touches you with the iron weapon. All is over then. You must go.”\r\n\r\n“But where?”\r\n\r\n“After him.”\r\n\r\n“But where?”\r\n\r\n“Wherever he likes, Gwynplaine.”\r\n\r\n“And if you resist?”\r\n\r\n“You are hanged.”\r\n\r\nUrsus looked out of the window again, and drawing a long breath, said,--\r\n\r\n“Thank God! He has passed. He was not coming here.”\r\n\r\nUrsus was perhaps unreasonably alarmed about the indiscreet remark, and\r\nthe consequences likely to result from the unconsidered words of\r\nGwynplaine.\r\n\r\nMaster Nicless, who had heard them, had no interest in compromising the\r\npoor inhabitants of the Green Box. He was amassing, at the same time as\r\nthe Laughing Man, a nice little fortune. “Chaos Vanquished” had\r\nsucceeded in two ways. While it made art triumph on the stage, it made\r\ndrunkenness prosper in the tavern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE MOUSE EXAMINED BY THE CATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUrsus was soon afterwards startled by another alarming circumstance.\r\nThis time it was he himself who was concerned. He was summoned to\r\nBishopsgate before a commission composed of three disagreeable\r\ncountenances. They belonged to three doctors, called overseers. One was\r\na Doctor of Theology, delegated by the Dean of Westminster; another, a\r\nDoctor of Medicine, delegated by the College of Surgeons; the third, a\r\nDoctor in History and Civil Law, delegated by Gresham College. These\r\nthree experts _in omni re scibili_ had the censorship of everything said\r\nin public throughout the bounds of the hundred and thirty parishes of\r\nLondon, the seventy-three of Middlesex, and, by extension, the five of\r\nSouthwark.\r\n\r\nSuch theological jurisdictions still subsist in England, and do good\r\nservice. In December, 1868, by sentence of the Court of Arches,\r\nconfirmed by the decision of the Privy Council, the Reverend Mackonochie\r\nwas censured, besides being condemned in costs, for having placed\r\nlighted candles on a table. The liturgy allows no jokes.\r\n\r\nUrsus, then, one fine day received from the delegated doctors an order\r\nto appear before them, which was, luckily, given into his own hands, and\r\nwhich he was therefore enabled to keep secret. Without saying a word, he\r\nobeyed the citation, shuddering at the thought that he might be\r\nconsidered culpable to the extent of having the appearance of being\r\nsuspected of a certain amount of rashness. He who had so recommended\r\nsilence to others had here a rough lesson. _Garrule, sana te ipsum_.\r\n\r\nThe three doctors, delegated and appointed overseers, sat at\r\nBishopsgate, at the end of a room on the ground floor, in three\r\narmchairs covered with black leather, with three busts of Minos, Æacus,\r\nand Rhadamanthus, in the wall above their heads, a table before them,\r\nand at their feet a form for the accused.\r\n\r\nUrsus, introduced by a tipstaff, of placid but severe expression,\r\nentered, perceived the doctors, and immediately in his own mind, gave to\r\neach of them the name of the judge of the infernal regions represented\r\nby the bust placed above his head. Minos, the president, the\r\nrepresentative of theology, made him a sign to sit down on the form.\r\n\r\nUrsus made a proper bow--that is to say, bowed to the ground; and\r\nknowing that bears are charmed by honey, and doctors by Latin, he said,\r\nkeeping his body still bent respectfully,--\r\n\r\n“_Tres faciunt capitulum_!”\r\n\r\nThen, with head inclined (for modesty disarms) he sat down on the form.\r\n\r\nEach of the three doctors had before him a bundle of papers, of which he\r\nwas turning the leaves.\r\n\r\nMinos began.\r\n\r\n“You speak in public?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Ursus.\r\n\r\n“By what right?”\r\n\r\n“I am a philosopher.”\r\n\r\n“That gives no right.”\r\n\r\n“I am also a mountebank,” said Ursus.\r\n\r\n“That is a different thing.”\r\n\r\nUrsus breathed again, but with humility.\r\n\r\nMinos resumed,--\r\n\r\n“As a mountebank, you may speak; as a philosopher, you must keep\r\nsilence.”\r\n\r\n“I will try,” said Ursus.\r\n\r\nThen he thought to himself.\r\n\r\n“I may speak, but I must be silent. How complicated.”\r\n\r\nHe was much alarmed.\r\n\r\nThe same overseer continued,--\r\n\r\n“You say things which do not sound right. You insult religion. You deny\r\nthe most evident truths. You propagate revolting errors. For instance,\r\nyou have said that the fact of virginity excludes the possibility of\r\nmaternity.”\r\n\r\nUrsus lifted his eyes meekly, “I did not say that. I said that the fact\r\nof maternity excludes the possibility of virginity.”\r\n\r\nMinos was thoughtful, and mumbled, “True, that is the contrary.”\r\n\r\nIt was really the same thing. But Ursus had parried the first blow.\r\n\r\nMinos, meditating on the answer just given by Ursus, sank into the\r\ndepths of his own imbecility, and kept silent.\r\n\r\nThe overseer of history, or, as Ursus called him, Rhadamanthus, covered\r\nthe retreat of Minos by this interpolation, “Accused! your audacity and\r\nyour errors are of two sorts. You have denied that the battle of\r\nPharsalia would have been lost because Brutus and Cassius had met a\r\nnegro.”\r\n\r\n“I said,” murmured Ursus “that there was something in the fact that\r\nCæsar was the better captain.”\r\n\r\nThe man of history passed, without transition, to mythology.\r\n\r\n“You have excused the infamous acts of Actæon.”\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Ursus, insinuatingly, “that a man is not dishonoured by\r\nhaving seen a naked woman.”\r\n\r\n“Then you are wrong,” said the judge severely. Rhadamanthus returned to\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n“Apropos of the accidents which happened to the cavalry of Mithridates,\r\nyou have contested the virtues of herbs and plants. You have denied that\r\na herb like the securiduca, could make the shoes of horses fall off.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” replied Ursus. “I said that the power existed only in the\r\nherb sferra cavallo. I never denied the virtue of any herb,” and he\r\nadded, in a low voice, “nor of any woman.”\r\n\r\nBy this extraneous addition to his answer Ursus proved to himself that,\r\nanxious as he was, he was not disheartened. Ursus was a compound of\r\nterror and presence of mind.\r\n\r\n“To continue,” resumed Rhadamanthus; “you have declared that it was\r\nfolly in Scipio, when he wished to open the gates of Carthage, to use as\r\na key the herb æthiopis, because the herb æthiopis has not the\r\nproperty of breaking locks.”\r\n\r\n“I merely said that he would have done better to have used the herb\r\nlunaria.”\r\n\r\n“That is a matter of opinion,” murmured Rhadamanthus, touched in his\r\nturn. And the man of history was silent.\r\n\r\nThe theologian, Minos, having returned to consciousness, questioned\r\nUrsus anew. He had had time to consult his notes.\r\n\r\n“You have classed orpiment amongst the products of arsenic, and you have\r\nsaid that it is a poison. The Bible denies this.”\r\n\r\n“The Bible denies, but arsenic affirms it,” sighed Ursus.\r\n\r\nThe man whom Ursus called Æacus, and who was the envy of medicine, had\r\nnot yet spoken, but now looking down on Ursus, with proudly half-closed\r\neyes, he said,--\r\n\r\n“The answer is not without some show of reason.”\r\n\r\nUrsus thanked him with his most cringing smile. Minos frowned\r\nfrightfully. “I resume,” said Minos. “You have said that it is false\r\nthat the basilisk is the king of serpents, under the name of\r\ncockatrice.”\r\n\r\n“Very reverend sir,” said Ursus, “so little did I desire to insult the\r\nbasilisk that I have given out as certain that it has a man’s head.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so,” replied Minos severely; “but you added that Poerius had seen\r\none with the head of a falcon. Can you prove it?”\r\n\r\n“Not easily,” said Ursus.\r\n\r\nHere he had lost a little ground.\r\n\r\nMinos, seizing the advantage, pushed it.\r\n\r\n“You have said that a converted Jew has not a nice smell.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. But I added that a Christian who becomes a Jew has a nasty one.”\r\n\r\nMinos lost his eyes over the accusing documents.\r\n\r\n“You have affirmed and propagated things which are impossible. You have\r\nsaid that Elien had seen an elephant write sentences.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, very reverend gentleman! I simply said that Oppian had heard a\r\nhippopotamus discuss a philosophical problem.”\r\n\r\n“You have declared that it is not true that a dish made of beech-wood\r\nwill become covered of itself with all the viands that one can desire.”\r\n\r\n“I said, that if it has this virtue, it must be that you received it\r\nfrom the devil.”\r\n\r\n“That I received it!”\r\n\r\n“No, most reverend sir. I, nobody, everybody!”\r\n\r\nAside, Ursus thought, “I don’t know what I am saying.”\r\n\r\nBut his outward confusion, though extreme, was not distinctly visible.\r\nUrsus struggled with it.\r\n\r\n“All this,” Minos began again, “implies a certain belief in the devil.”\r\n\r\nUrsus held his own.\r\n\r\n“Very reverend sir, I am not an unbeliever with regard to the devil.\r\nBelief in the devil is the reverse side of faith in God. The one proves\r\nthe other. He who does not believe a little in the devil, does not\r\nbelieve much in God. He who believes in the sun must believe in the\r\nshadow. The devil is the night of God. What is night? The proof of day.”\r\n\r\nUrsus here extemporized a fathomless combination of philosophy and\r\nreligion. Minos remained pensive, and relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\nUrsus breathed afresh.\r\n\r\nA sharp onslaught now took place. Æacus, the medical delegate, who had\r\ndisdainfully protected Ursus against the theologian, now turned suddenly\r\nfrom auxiliary into assailant. He placed his closed fist on his bundle\r\nof papers, which was large and heavy. Ursus received this apostrophe\r\nfull in the breast,--\r\n\r\n“It is proved that crystal is sublimated ice, and that the diamond is\r\nsublimated crystal. It is averred that ice becomes crystal in a thousand\r\nyears, and crystal diamond in a thousand ages. You have denied this.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” replied Ursus, with sadness, “I only said that in a thousand\r\nyears ice had time to melt, and that a thousand ages were difficult to\r\ncount.”\r\n\r\nThe examination went on; questions and answers clashed like swords.\r\n\r\n“You have denied that plants can talk.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. But to do so they must grow under a gibbet.”\r\n\r\n“Do you own that the mandragora cries?”\r\n\r\n“No; but it sings.”\r\n\r\n“You have denied that the fourth finger of the left hand has a cordial\r\nvirtue.”\r\n\r\n“I only said that to sneeze to the left was a bad sign.”\r\n\r\n“You have spoken rashly and disrespectfully of the phoenix.”\r\n\r\n“Learned judge, I merely said that when he wrote that the brain of the\r\nphoenix was a delicate morsel, but that it produced headache, Plutarch\r\nwas a little out of his reckoning, inasmuch as the phoenix never\r\nexisted.”\r\n\r\n“A detestable speech! The cinnamalker which makes its nest with sticks\r\nof cinnamon, the rhintacus that Parysatis used in the manufacture of his\r\npoisons, the manucodiatas which is the bird of paradise, and the\r\nsemenda, which has a threefold beak, have been mistaken for the phoenix;\r\nbut the phoenix has existed.”\r\n\r\n“I do not deny it.”\r\n\r\n“You are a stupid ass.”\r\n\r\n“I desire to be thought no better.”\r\n\r\n“You have confessed that the elder tree cures the quinsy, but you added\r\nthat it was not because it has in its root a fairy excrescence.”\r\n\r\n“I said it was because Judas hung himself on an elder tree.”\r\n\r\n“A plausible opinion,” growled the theologian, glad to strike his little\r\nblow at Æacus.\r\n\r\nArrogance repulsed soon turns to anger. Æacus was enraged.\r\n\r\n“Wandering mountebank! you wander as much in mind as with your feet.\r\nYour tendencies are out of the way and suspicious. You approach the\r\nbounds of sorcery. You have dealings with unknown animals. You speak to\r\nthe populace of things that exist but for you alone, and the nature of\r\nwhich is unknown, such as the hoemorrhoüs.”\r\n\r\n“The hoemorrhoüs is a viper which was seen by Tremellius.”\r\n\r\nThis repartee produced a certain disorder in the irritated science of\r\nDoctor Æacus.\r\n\r\nUrsus added, “The existence of the hoemorrhoüs is quite as true as that\r\nof the odoriferous hyena, and of the civet described by Castellus.”\r\n\r\nÆacus got out of the difficulty by charging home.\r\n\r\n“Here are your own words, and very diabolical words they are. Listen.”\r\n\r\nWith his eyes on his notes, Æacus read,--\r\n\r\n“Two plants, the thalagssigle and the aglaphotis, are luminous in the\r\nevening, flowers by day, stars by night;” and looking steadily at Ursus,\r\n“What have you to say to that?”\r\n\r\nUrsus answered,--\r\n\r\n“Every plant is a lamp. Its perfume is its light.” Æacus turned over\r\nother pages.\r\n\r\n“You have denied that the vesicles of the otter are equivalent to\r\ncastoreum.”\r\n\r\n“I merely said that perhaps it may be necessary to receive the teaching\r\nof Ætius on this point with some reserve.”\r\n\r\nÆacus became furious.\r\n\r\n“You practise medicine?”\r\n\r\n“I practise medicine,” sighed Ursus timidly.\r\n\r\n“On living things?”\r\n\r\n“Rather than on dead ones,” said Ursus.\r\n\r\nUrsus defended himself stoutly, but dully; an admirable mixture, in\r\nwhich meekness predominated. He spoke with such gentleness that Doctor\r\nÆacus felt that he must insult him.\r\n\r\n“What are you murmuring there?” said he rudely.\r\n\r\nUrsus was amazed, and restricted himself to saying,--\r\n\r\n“Murmurings are for the young, and moans for the aged. Alas, I moan!”\r\n\r\nÆacus replied,--\r\n\r\n“Be assured of this--if you attend a sick person, and he dies, you will\r\nbe punished by death.”\r\n\r\nUrsus hazarded a question.\r\n\r\n“And if he gets well?”\r\n\r\n“In that case,” said the doctor, softening his voice, “you will be\r\npunished by death.”\r\n\r\n“There is little difference,” said Ursus.\r\n\r\nThe doctor replied,--\r\n\r\n“If death ensues, we punish gross ignorance; if recovery, we punish\r\npresumption. The gibbet in either case.”\r\n\r\n“I was ignorant of the circumstance,” murmured Ursus. “I thank you for\r\nteaching me. One does not know all the beauties of the law.”\r\n\r\n“Take care of yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Religiously,” said Ursus.\r\n\r\n“We know what you are about.”\r\n\r\n“As for me,” thought Ursus, “that is more than I always know myself.”\r\n\r\n“We could send you to prison.”\r\n\r\n“I see that perfectly, gentlemen.”\r\n\r\n“You cannot deny your infractions nor your encroachments.”\r\n\r\n“My philosophy asks pardon.”\r\n\r\n“Great audacity has been attributed to you.”\r\n\r\n“That is quite a mistake.”\r\n\r\n“It is said that you have cured the sick.”\r\n\r\n“I am the victim of calumny.”\r\n\r\nThe three pairs of eyebrows which were so horribly fixed on Ursus\r\ncontracted. The three wise faces drew near to each other, and whispered.\r\nUrsus had the vision of a vague fool’s cap sketched out above those\r\nthree empowered heads. The low and requisite whispering of the trio was\r\nof some minutes’ duration, during which time Ursus felt all the ice and\r\nall the scorch of agony. At length Minos, who was president, turned to\r\nhim and said angrily,--\r\n\r\n“Go away!”\r\n\r\nUrsus felt something like Jonas when he was leaving the belly of the\r\nwhale.\r\n\r\nMinos continued,--\r\n\r\n“You are discharged.”\r\n\r\nUrsus said to himself,--\r\n\r\n“They won’t catch me at this again. Good-bye, medicine!”\r\n\r\nAnd he added in his innermost heart,--\r\n\r\n“From henceforth I will carefully allow them to die.”\r\n\r\nBent double, he bowed everywhere; to the doctors, to the busts, the\r\ntables, the walls, and retiring backwards through the door, disappeared\r\nalmost as a shadow melting into air.\r\n\r\nHe left the hall slowly, like an innocent man, and rushed from the\r\nstreet rapidly, like a guilty one. The officers of justice are so\r\nsingular and obscure in their ways that even when acquitted one flies\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nAs he fled he mumbled,--\r\n\r\n“I am well out of it. I am the savant untamed; they the savants\r\ncivilized. Doctors cavil at the learned. False science is the excrement\r\nof the true, and is employed to the destruction of philosophers.\r\nPhilosophers, as they produce sophists, produce their own scourge. Of\r\nthe dung of the thrush is born the mistletoe, with which is made\r\nbirdlime, with which the thrush is captured. _Turdus sibi malum cacat_.”\r\n\r\nWe do not represent Ursus as a refined man. He was imprudent enough to\r\nuse words which expressed his thoughts. He had no more taste than\r\nVoltaire.\r\n\r\nWhen Ursus returned to the Green Box, he told Master Nicless that he\r\nhad been delayed by following a pretty woman, and let not a word escape\r\nhim concerning his adventure.\r\n\r\nExcept in the evening when he said in a low voice to Homo,--\r\n\r\n“See here, I have vanquished the three heads of Cerberus.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nWHY SHOULD A GOLD PIECE LOWER ITSELF BY MIXING WITH A HEAP OF PENNIES?\r\n\r\n\r\nAn event happened.\r\n\r\nThe Tadcaster Inn became more and more a furnace of joy and laughter.\r\nNever was there more resonant gaiety. The landlord and his boy were\r\nbecome insufficient to draw the ale, stout, and porter. In the evening\r\nin the lower room, with its windows all aglow, there was not a vacant\r\ntable. They sang, they shouted; the great old hearth, vaulted like an\r\noven, with its iron bars piled with coals, shone out brightly. It was\r\nlike a house of fire and noise.\r\n\r\nIn the yard--that is to say, in the theatre--the crowd was greater\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nCrowds as great as the suburb of Southwark could supply so thronged the\r\nperformances of “Chaos Vanquished” that directly the curtain was\r\nraised--that is to say, the platform of the Green Box was lowered--every\r\nplace was filled. The windows were alive with spectators, the balcony\r\nwas crammed. Not a single paving-stone in the paved yard was to be seen.\r\nIt seemed paved with faces.\r\n\r\nOnly the compartment for the nobility remained empty.\r\n\r\nThere was thus a space in the centre of the balcony, a black hole,\r\ncalled in metaphorical slang, an oven. No one there. Crowds everywhere\r\nexcept in that one spot.\r\n\r\nOne evening it was occupied.\r\n\r\nIt was on a Saturday, a day on which the English make all haste to amuse\r\nthemselves before the _ennui_ of Sunday. The hall was full.\r\n\r\nWe say _hall_. Shakespeare for a long time had to use the yard of an inn\r\nfor a theatre, and he called it _hall_.\r\n\r\nJust as the curtain rose on the prologue of “Chaos Vanquished,” with\r\nUrsus, Homo, and Gwynplaine on the stage, Ursus, from habit, cast a\r\nlook at the audience, and felt a sensation.\r\n\r\nThe compartment for the nobility was occupied. A lady was sitting alone\r\nin the middle of the box, on the Utrecht velvet arm-chair. She was\r\nalone, and she filled the box. Certain beings seem to give out light.\r\nThis lady, like Dea, had a light in herself, but a light of a different\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nDea was pale, this lady was pink. Dea was the twilight, this lady,\r\nAurora. Dea was beautiful, this lady was superb. Dea was innocence,\r\ncandour, fairness, alabaster--this woman was of the purple, and one felt\r\nthat she did not fear the blush. Her irradiation overflowed the box, she\r\nsat in the midst of it, immovable, in the spreading majesty of an idol.\r\n\r\nAmidst the sordid crowd she shone out grandly, as with the radiance of a\r\ncarbuncle. She inundated it with so much light that she drowned it in\r\nshadow, and all the mean faces in it underwent eclipse. Her splendour\r\nblotted out all else.\r\n\r\nEvery eye was turned towards her.\r\n\r\nTom-Jim-Jack was in the crowd. He was lost like the rest in the nimbus\r\nof this dazzling creature.\r\n\r\nThe lady at first absorbed the whole attention of the public, who had\r\ncrowded to the performance, thus somewhat diminishing the opening\r\neffects of “Chaos Vanquished.”\r\n\r\nWhatever might be the air of dreamland about her, for those who were\r\nnear she was a woman; perchance too much a woman.\r\n\r\nShe was tall and amply formed, and showed as much as possible of her\r\nmagnificent person. She wore heavy earrings of pearls, with which were\r\nmixed those whimsical jewels called “keys of England.” Her upper dress\r\nwas of Indian muslin, embroidered all over with gold--a great luxury,\r\nbecause those muslin dresses then cost six hundred crowns. A large\r\ndiamond brooch closed her chemise, the which she wore so as to display\r\nher shoulders and bosom, in the immodest fashion of the time; the\r\nchemisette was made of that lawn of which Anne of Austria had sheets so\r\nfine that they could be passed through a ring. She wore what seemed like\r\na cuirass of rubies--some uncut, but polished, and precious stones were\r\nsewn all over the body of her dress. Then, her eyebrows were blackened\r\nwith Indian ink; and her arms, elbows, shoulders, chin, and nostrils,\r\nwith the top of her eyelids, the lobes of her ears, the palms of her\r\nhands, the tips of her fingers, were tinted with a glowing and\r\nprovoking touch of colour. Above all, she wore an expression of\r\nimplacable determination to be beautiful. This reached the point of\r\nferocity. She was like a panther, with the power of turning cat at will,\r\nand caressing. One of her eyes was blue, the other black.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, as well as Ursus, contemplated her.\r\n\r\nThe Green Box somewhat resembled a phantasmagoria in its\r\nrepresentations. “Chaos Vanquished” was rather a dream than a piece; it\r\ngenerally produced on the audience the effect of a vision. Now, this\r\neffect was reflected on the actors. The house took the performers by\r\nsurprise, and they were thunderstruck in their turn. It was a rebound of\r\nfascination.\r\n\r\nThe woman watched them, and they watched her.\r\n\r\nAt the distance at which they were placed, and in that luminous mist\r\nwhich is the half-light of a theatre, details were lost and it was like\r\na hallucination. Of course it was a woman, but was it not a chimera as\r\nwell? The penetration of her light into their obscurity stupefied them.\r\nIt was like the appearance of an unknown planet. It came from a world of\r\nthe happy. Her irradiation amplified her figure. The lady was covered\r\nwith nocturnal glitterings, like a milky way. Her precious stones were\r\nstars. The diamond brooch was perhaps a pleiad. The splendid beauty of\r\nher bosom seemed supernatural. They felt, as they looked upon the\r\nstar-like creature, the momentary but thrilling approach of the regions\r\nof felicity. It was out of the heights of a Paradise that she leant\r\ntowards their mean-looking Green Box, and revealed to the gaze of its\r\nwretched audience her expression of inexorable serenity. As she\r\nsatisfied her unbounded curiosity, she fed at the same time the\r\ncuriosity of the public.\r\n\r\nIt was the Zenith permitting the Abyss to look at it.\r\n\r\nUrsus, Gwynplaine, Vinos, Fibi, the crowd, every one had succumbed to\r\nher dazzling beauty, except Dea, ignorant in her darkness.\r\n\r\nAn apparition was indeed before them; but none of the ideas usually\r\nevoked by the word were realized in the lady’s appearance.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing about her diaphanous, nothing undecided, nothing\r\nfloating, no mist. She was an apparition; rose-coloured and fresh, and\r\nfull of health. Yet, under the optical condition in which Ursus and\r\nGwynplaine were placed, she looked like a vision. There are fleshy\r\nphantoms, called vampires. Such a queen as she, though a spirit to the\r\ncrowd, consumes twelve hundred thousand a year, to keep her health.\r\n\r\nBehind the lady, in the shadow, her page was to be perceived, _el mozo_,\r\na little child-like man, fair and pretty, with a serious face. A very\r\nyoung and very grave servant was the fashion at that period. This page\r\nwas dressed from top to toe in scarlet velvet, and had on his skull-cap,\r\nwhich was embroidered with gold, a bunch of curled feathers. This was\r\nthe sign of a high class of service, and indicated attendance on a very\r\ngreat lady.\r\n\r\nThe lackey is part of the lord, and it was impossible not to remark, in\r\nthe shadow of his mistress, the train-bearing page. Memory often takes\r\nnotes unconsciously; and, without Gwynplaine’s suspecting it, the round\r\ncheeks, the serious mien, the embroidered and plumed cap of the lady’s\r\npage left some trace on his mind. The page, however, did nothing to call\r\nattention to himself. To do so is to be wanting in respect. He held\r\nhimself aloof and passive at the back of the box, retiring as far as the\r\nclosed door permitted.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the presence of her train-bearer, the lady was not the\r\nless alone in the compartment, since a valet counts for nothing.\r\n\r\nHowever powerful a diversion had been produced by this person, who\r\nproduced the effect of a personage, the _dénouement_ of “Chaos\r\nVanquished” was more powerful still. The impression which it made was,\r\nas usual, irresistible. Perhaps, even, there occurred in the hall, on\r\naccount of the radiant spectator (for sometimes the spectator is part of\r\nthe spectacle), an increase of electricity. The contagion of\r\nGwynplaine’s laugh was more triumphant than ever. The whole audience\r\nfell into an indescribable epilepsy of hilarity, through which could be\r\ndistinguished the sonorous and magisterial ha! ha! of Tom-Jim-Jack.\r\n\r\nOnly the unknown lady looked at the performance with the immobility of a\r\nstatue, and with her eyes, like those of a phantom, she laughed not. A\r\nspectre, but sun-born.\r\n\r\nThe performance over, the platform drawn up, and the family reassembled\r\nin the Green Box, Ursus opened and emptied on the supper-table the bag\r\nof receipts. From a heap of pennies there slid suddenly forth a Spanish\r\ngold onza. “Hers!” cried Ursus.\r\n\r\nThe onza amidst the pence covered with verdigris was a type of the lady\r\namidst the crowd.\r\n\r\n“She has paid an onza for her seat,” cried Ursus with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nJust then, the hotel-keeper entered the Green Box, and, passing his arm\r\nout of the window at the back of it, opened the loophole in the wall of\r\nwhich we have already spoken, which gave a view over the field, and\r\nwhich was level with the window; then he made a silent sign to Ursus to\r\nlook out. A carriage, swarming with plumed footmen carrying torches and\r\nmagnificently appointed, was driving off at a fast trot.\r\n\r\nUrsus took the piece of gold between his forefinger and thumb\r\nrespectfully, and, showing it to Master Nicless, said,--\r\n\r\n“She is a goddess.”\r\n\r\nThen his eyes falling on the carriage which was about to turn the corner\r\nof the field, and on the imperial of which the footmen’s torches lighted\r\nup a golden coronet, with eight strawberry leaves, he exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“She is more. She is a duchess.”\r\n\r\nThe carriage disappeared: The rumbling of its wheels died away in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nUrsus remained some moments in an ecstasy, holding the gold piece\r\nbetween his finger and thumb, as in a monstrance, elevating it as the\r\npriest elevates the host.\r\n\r\nThen he placed it on the table, and, as he contemplated it, began to\r\ntalk of “Madam.”\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper replied,--\r\n\r\n“She was a duchess.” Yes. They knew her title. But her name? Of that\r\nthey were ignorant. Master Nicless had been close to the carriage, and\r\nseen the coat of arms and the footmen covered with lace. The coachman\r\nhad a wig on which might have belonged to a Lord Chancellor. The\r\ncarriage was of that rare design called, in Spain, _cochetumbon_, a\r\nsplendid build, with a top like a tomb, which makes a magnificent\r\nsupport for a coronet. The page was a man in miniature, so small that he\r\ncould sit on the step of the carriage outside the door. The duty of\r\nthose pretty creatures was to bear the trains of their mistresses. They\r\nalso bore their messages. And did you remark the plumed cap of the\r\npage? How grand it was! You pay a fine if you wear those plumes without\r\nthe right of doing so. Master Nicless had seen the lady, too, quite\r\nclose. A kind of queen. Such wealth gives beauty. The skin is whiter,\r\nthe eye more proud, the gait more noble, and grace more insolent.\r\nNothing can equal the elegant impertinence of hands which never work.\r\nMaster Nicless told the story of all the magnificence, of the white skin\r\nwith the blue veins, the neck, the shoulders, the arms, the touch of\r\npaint everywhere, the pearl earrings, the head-dress powdered with gold;\r\nthe profusion of stones, the rubies, the diamonds.\r\n\r\n“Less brilliant than her eyes,” murmured Ursus.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine said nothing.\r\n\r\nDea listened.\r\n\r\n“And do you know,” said the tavern-keeper, “the most wonderful thing of\r\nall?”\r\n\r\n“What?” said Ursus.\r\n\r\n“I saw her get into her carriage.”\r\n\r\n“What then?”\r\n\r\n“She did not get in alone.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“Some one got in with her.”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“Guess.”\r\n\r\n“The king,” said Ursus.\r\n\r\n“In the first place,” said Master Nicless, “there is no king at present.\r\nWe are not living under a king. Guess who got into the carriage with the\r\nduchess.”\r\n\r\n“Jupiter,” said Ursus.\r\n\r\nThe hotel-keeper replied,--\r\n\r\n“Tom-Jim-Jack!”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, who had not said a word, broke silence.\r\n\r\n“Tom-Jim-Jack!” he cried.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of astonishment, during which the low voice of Dea was\r\nheard to say,--\r\n\r\n“Cannot this woman be prevented coming.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS OF POISONING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “apparition” did not return. It did not reappear in the theatre, but\r\nit reappeared to the memory of Gwynplaine. Gwynplaine was, to a certain\r\ndegree, troubled. It seemed to him that for the first time in his life\r\nhe had seen a woman.\r\n\r\nHe made that first stumble, a strange dream. We should beware of the\r\nnature of the reveries that fasten on us. Reverie has in it the mystery\r\nand subtlety of an odour. It is to thought what perfume is to the\r\ntuberose. It is at times the exudation of a venomous idea, and it\r\npenetrates like a vapour. You may poison yourself with reveries, as with\r\nflowers. An intoxicating suicide, exquisite and malignant. The suicide\r\nof the soul is evil thought. In it is the poison. Reverie attracts,\r\ncajoles, lures, entwines, and then makes you its accomplice. It makes\r\nyou bear your half in the trickeries which it plays on conscience. It\r\ncharms; then it corrupts you. We may say of reverie as of play, one\r\nbegins by being a dupe, and ends by being a cheat.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine dreamed.\r\n\r\nHe had never before seen Woman. He had seen the shadow in the women of\r\nthe populace, and he had seen the soul in Dea.\r\n\r\nHe had just seen the reality.\r\n\r\nA warm and living skin, under which one felt the circulation of\r\npassionate blood; an outline with the precision of marble and the\r\nundulation of the wave; a high and impassive mien, mingling refusal with\r\nattraction, and summing itself up in its own glory; hair of the colour\r\nof the reflection from a furnace; a gallantry of adornment producing in\r\nherself and in others a tremor of voluptuousness, the half-revealed\r\nnudity betraying a disdainful desire to be coveted at a distance by the\r\ncrowd; an ineradicable coquetry; the charm of impenetrability,\r\ntemptation seasoned by the glimpse of perdition, a promise to the senses\r\nand a menace to the mind; a double anxiety, the one desire, the other\r\nfear. He had just seen these things. He had just seen Woman.\r\n\r\nHe had seen more and less than a woman; he had seen a female.\r\n\r\nAnd at the same time an Olympian. The female of a god.\r\n\r\nThe mystery of sex had just been revealed to him.\r\n\r\nAnd where? On inaccessible heights--at an infinite distance.\r\n\r\nO mocking destiny! The soul, that celestial essence, he possessed; he\r\nheld it in his hand. It was Dea. Sex, that terrestrial embodiment, he\r\nperceived in the heights of heaven. It was that woman.\r\n\r\nA duchess!\r\n\r\n“More than a goddess,” Ursus had said.\r\n\r\nWhat a precipice! Even dreams dissolved before such a perpendicular\r\nheight to escalade.\r\n\r\nWas he going to commit the folly of dreaming about the unknown beauty?\r\n\r\nHe debated with himself.\r\n\r\nHe recalled all that Ursus had said of high stations which are almost\r\nroyal. The philosopher’s disquisitions, which had hitherto seemed so\r\nuseless, now became landmarks for his thoughts. A very thin layer of\r\nforgetfulness often lies over our memory, through which at times we\r\ncatch a glimpse of all beneath it. His fancy ran on that august world,\r\nthe peerage, to which the lady belonged, and which was so inexorably\r\nplaced above the inferior world, the common people, of which he was one.\r\n\r\nAnd was he even one of the people? Was not he, the mountebank, below the\r\nlowest of the low? For the first time since he had arrived at the age of\r\nreflection, he felt his heart vaguely contracted by a sense of his\r\nbaseness, and of that which we nowadays call abasement. The paintings\r\nand the catalogues of Ursus, his lyrical inventories, his dithyrambics\r\nof castles, parks, fountains, and colonnades, his catalogues of riches\r\nand of power, revived in the memory of Gwynplaine in the relief of\r\nreality mingled with mist. He was possessed with the image of this\r\nzenith. That a man should be a lord!--it seemed chimerical. It was so,\r\nhowever. Incredible thing! There were lords! But were they of flesh and\r\nblood, like ourselves? It seemed doubtful. He felt that he lay at the\r\nbottom of all darkness, encompassed by a wall, while he could just\r\nperceive in the far distance above his head, through the mouth of the\r\npit, a dazzling confusion of azure, of figures, and of rays, which was\r\nOlympus. In the midst of this glory the duchess shone out resplendent.\r\n\r\nHe felt for this woman a strange, inexpressible longing, combined with a\r\nconviction of the impossibility of attainment. This poignant\r\ncontradiction returned to his mind again and again, notwithstanding\r\nevery effort. He saw near to him, even within his reach, in close and\r\ntangible reality, the soul; and in the unattainable--in the depths of\r\nthe ideal--the flesh. None of these thoughts attained to certain shape.\r\nThey were as a vapour within him, changing every instant its form, and\r\nfloating away. But the darkness which the vapour caused was intense.\r\n\r\nHe did not form even in his dreams any hope of reaching the heights\r\nwhere the duchess dwelt. Luckily for him.\r\n\r\nThe vibration of such ladders of fancy, if ever we put our foot upon\r\nthem, may render our brains dizzy for ever. Intending to scale Olympus,\r\nwe reach Bedlam; any distinct feeling of actual desire would have\r\nterrified him. He entertained none of that nature.\r\n\r\nBesides, was he likely ever to see the lady again? Most probably not. To\r\nfall in love with a passing light on the horizon, madness cannot reach\r\nto that pitch. To make loving eyes at a star even, is not\r\nincomprehensible. It is seen again, it reappears, it is fixed in the\r\nsky. But can any one be enamoured of a flash of lightning?\r\n\r\nDreams flowed and ebbed within him. The majestic and gallant idol at the\r\nback of the box had cast a light over his diffused ideas, then faded\r\naway. He thought, yet thought not of it; turned to other\r\nthings--returned to it. It rocked about in his brain--nothing more. It\r\nbroke his sleep for several nights. Sleeplessness is as full of dreams\r\nas sleep.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to express in their exact limits the abstract\r\nevolutions of the brain. The inconvenience of words is that they are\r\nmore marked in form than ideas. All ideas have indistinct boundary\r\nlines, words have not. A certain diffused phase of the soul ever escapes\r\nwords. Expression has its frontiers, thought has none.\r\n\r\nThe depths of our secret souls are so vast that Gwynplaine’s dreams\r\nscarcely touched Dea. Dea reigned sacred in the centre of his soul;\r\nnothing could approach her.\r\n\r\nStill (for such contradictions make up the soul of man) there was a\r\nconflict within him. Was he conscious of it? Scarcely.\r\n\r\nIn his heart of hearts he felt a collision of desires. We all have our\r\nweak points. Its nature would have been clear to Ursus; but to\r\nGwynplaine it was not.\r\n\r\nTwo instincts--one the ideal, the other sexual--were struggling within\r\nhim. Such contests occur between the angels of light and darkness on the\r\nedge of the abyss.\r\n\r\nAt length the angel of darkness was overthrown. One day Gwynplaine\r\nsuddenly thought no more of the unknown woman.\r\n\r\nThe struggle between two principles--the duel between his earthly and\r\nhis heavenly nature--had taken place within his soul, and at such a\r\ndepth that he had understood it but dimly. One thing was certain, that\r\nhe had never for one moment ceased to adore Dea.\r\n\r\nHe had been attacked by a violent disorder, his blood had been fevered;\r\nbut it was over. Dea alone remained.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine would have been much astonished had any one told him that Dea\r\nhad ever been, even for a moment, in danger; and in a week or two the\r\nphantom which had threatened the hearts of both their souls faded away.\r\n\r\nWithin Gwynplaine nothing remained but the heart, which was the hearth,\r\nand the love, which was its fire.\r\n\r\nBesides, we have just said that “the duchess” did not return.\r\n\r\nUrsus thought it all very natural. “The lady with the gold piece” is a\r\nphenomenon. She enters, pays, and vanishes. It would be too much joy\r\nwere she to return.\r\n\r\nAs to Dea, she made no allusion to the woman who had come and passed\r\naway. She listened, perhaps, and was sufficiently enlightened by the\r\nsighs of Ursus, and now and then by some significant exclamation, such\r\nas,--\r\n\r\n“_One does not get ounces of gold every day!_”\r\n\r\nShe spoke no more of the “woman.” This showed deep instinct. The soul\r\ntakes obscure precautions, in the secrets of which it is not always\r\nadmitted itself. To keep silence about any one seems to keep them afar\r\noff. One fears that questions may call them back. We put silence between\r\nus, as if we were shutting a door.\r\n\r\nSo the incident fell into oblivion.\r\n\r\nWas it ever anything? Had it ever occurred? Could it be said that a\r\nshadow had floated between Gwynplaine and Dea? Dea did not know of it,\r\nnor Gwynplaine either. No; nothing had occurred. The duchess herself was\r\nblurred in the distant perspective like an illusion. It had been but a\r\nmomentary dream passing over Gwynplaine, out of which he had awakened.\r\n\r\nWhen it fades away, a reverie, like a mist, leaves no trace behind; and\r\nwhen the cloud has passed on, love shines out as brightly in the heart\r\nas the sun in the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nABYSSUS ABYSSUM VOCAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother face, disappeared--Tom-Jim-Jack’s. Suddenly he ceased to\r\nfrequent the Tadcaster Inn.\r\n\r\nPersons so situated as to be able to observe other phases of fashionable\r\nlife in London, might have seen that about this time the _Weekly\r\nGazette_, between two extracts from parish registers, announced the\r\ndeparture of Lord David Dirry-Moir, by order of her Majesty, to take\r\ncommand of his frigate in the white squadron then cruising off the coast\r\nof Holland.\r\n\r\nUrsus, perceiving that Tom-Jim-Jack did not return, was troubled by his\r\nabsence. He had not seen Tom-Jim-Jack since the day on which he had\r\ndriven off in the same carriage with the lady of the gold piece. It was,\r\nindeed, an enigma who this Tom-Jim-Jack could be, who carried off\r\nduchesses under his arm. What an interesting investigation! What\r\nquestions to propound! What things to be said. Therefore Ursus said not\r\na word.\r\n\r\nUrsus, who had had experience, knew the smart caused by rash curiosity.\r\nCuriosity ought always to be proportioned to the curious. By listening,\r\nwe risk our ear; by watching, we risk our eye. Prudent people neither\r\nhear nor see. Tom-Jim-Jack had got into a princely carriage. The\r\ntavern-keeper had seen him. It appeared so extraordinary that the sailor\r\nshould sit by the lady that it made Ursus circumspect. The caprices of\r\nthose in high life ought to be sacred to the lower orders. The reptiles\r\ncalled the poor had best squat in their holes when they see anything out\r\nof the way. Quiescence is a power. Shut your eyes, if you have not the\r\nluck to be blind; stop up your ears, if you have not the good fortune to\r\nbe deaf; paralyze your tongue, if you have not the perfection of being\r\nmute. The great do what they like, the little what they can. Let the\r\nunknown pass unnoticed. Do not importune mythology. Do not interrogate\r\nappearances. Have a profound respect for idols. Do not let us direct our\r\ngossiping towards the lessenings or increasings which take place in\r\nsuperior regions, of the motives of which we are ignorant. Such things\r\nare mostly optical delusions to us inferior creatures. Metamorphoses are\r\nthe business of the gods: the transformations and the contingent\r\ndisorders of great persons who float above us are clouds impossible to\r\ncomprehend and perilous to study. Too much attention irritates the\r\nOlympians engaged in their gyrations of amusement or fancy; and a\r\nthunderbolt may teach you that the bull you are too curiously examining\r\nis Jupiter. Do not lift the folds of the stone-coloured mantles of those\r\nterrible powers. Indifference is intelligence. Do not stir, and you will\r\nbe safe. Feign death, and they will not kill you. Therein lies the\r\nwisdom of the insect. Ursus practised it.\r\n\r\nThe tavern-keeper, who was puzzled as well, questioned Ursus one day.\r\n\r\n“Do you observe that Tom-Jim-Jack never comes here now!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” said Ursus. “I have not remarked it.”\r\n\r\nMaster Nicless made an observation in an undertone, no doubt touching\r\nthe intimacy between the ducal carriage and Tom-Jim-Jack--a remark\r\nwhich, as it might have been irreverent and dangerous, Ursus took care\r\nnot to hear.\r\n\r\nStill Ursus was too much of an artist not to regret Tom-Jim-Jack. He\r\nfelt some disappointment. He told his feeling to Homo, of whose\r\ndiscretion alone he felt certain. He whispered into the ear of the wolf,\r\n“Since Tom-Jim-Jack ceased to come, I feel a blank as a man, and a chill\r\nas a poet.” This pouring out of his heart to a friend relieved Ursus.\r\n\r\nHis lips were sealed before Gwynplaine, who, however, made no allusion\r\nto Tom-Jim-Jack. The fact was that Tom-Jim-Jack’s presence or absence\r\nmattered not to Gwynplaine, absorbed as he was in Dea.\r\n\r\nForgetfulness fell more and more on Gwynplaine. As for Dea, she had not\r\neven suspected the existence of a vague trouble. At the same time, no\r\nmore cabals or complaints against the Laughing Man were spoken of. Hate\r\nseemed to have let go its hold. All was tranquil in and around the Green\r\nBox. No more opposition from strollers, merry-andrews, nor priests; no\r\nmore grumbling outside. Their success was unclouded. Destiny allows of\r\nsuch sudden serenity. The brilliant happiness of Gwynplaine and Dea was\r\nfor the present absolutely cloudless. Little by little it had risen to a\r\ndegree which admitted of no increase. There is one word which expresses\r\nthe situation--apogee. Happiness, like the sea, has its high tide. The\r\nworst thing for the perfectly happy is that it recedes.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of being inaccessible: being too high and being too\r\nlow. At least as much, perhaps, as the first is the second to be\r\ndesired. More surely than the eagle escapes the arrow, the animalcule\r\nescapes being crushed. This security of insignificance, if it had ever\r\nexisted on earth, was enjoyed by Gwynplaine and Dea, and never before\r\nhad it been so complete. They lived on, daily more and more ecstatically\r\nwrapt in each other. The heart saturates itself with love as with a\r\ndivine salt that preserves it, and from this arises the incorruptible\r\nconstancy of those who have loved each other from the dawn of their\r\nlives, and the affection which keeps its freshness in old age. There is\r\nsuch a thing as the embalmment of the heart. It is of Daphnis and Chloë\r\nthat Philemon and Baucis are made. The old age of which we speak,\r\nevening resembling morning, was evidently reserved for Gwynplaine and\r\nDea. In the meantime they were young.\r\n\r\nUrsus looked on this love as a doctor examines his case. He had what was\r\nin those days termed a hippocratical expression of face. He fixed his\r\nsagacious eyes on Dea, fragile and pale, and growled out, “It is lucky\r\nthat she is happy.” At other times he said, “She is lucky for her\r\nhealth’s sake.” He shook his head, and at times read attentively a\r\nportion treating of heart-disease in Aviccunas, translated by Vossiscus\r\nFortunatus, Louvain, 1650, an old worm-eaten book of his.\r\n\r\nDea, when fatigued, suffered from perspirations and drowsiness, and took\r\na daily _siesta_, as we have already seen. One day, while she was lying\r\nasleep on the bearskin, Gwynplaine was out, and Ursus bent down softly\r\nand applied his ear to Dea’s heart. He seemed to listen for a few\r\nminutes, and then stood up, murmuring, “She must not have any shock. It\r\nwould find out the weak place.”\r\n\r\nThe crowd continued to flock to the performance of “Chaos Vanquished.”\r\nThe success of the Laughing Man seemed inexhaustible. Every one rushed\r\nto see him; no longer from Southwark only, but even from other parts of\r\nLondon. The general public began to mingle with the usual audience,\r\nwhich no longer consisted of sailors and drivers only; in the opinion of\r\nMaster Nicless, who was well acquainted with crowds, there were in the\r\ncrowd gentlemen and baronets disguised as common people. Disguise is one\r\nof the pleasures of pride, and was much in fashion at that period. This\r\nmixing of the aristocratic element with the mob was a good sign, and\r\nshowed that their popularity was extending to London. The fame of\r\nGwynplaine has decidedly penetrated into the great world. Such was the\r\nfact. Nothing was talked of but the Laughing Man. He was talked about\r\neven at the Mohawk Club, frequented by noblemen.\r\n\r\nIn the Green Box they had no idea of all this. They were content to be\r\nhappy. It was intoxication to Dea to feel, as she did every evening, the\r\ncrisp and tawny head of Gwynplaine. In love there is nothing like habit.\r\nThe whole of life is concentrated in it. The reappearance of the stars\r\nis the custom of the universe. Creation is nothing but a mistress, and\r\nthe sun is a lover. Light is a dazzling caryatid supporting the world.\r\nEach day, for a sublime minute, the earth, covered by night, rests on\r\nthe rising sun. Dea, blind, felt a like return of warmth and hope within\r\nher when she placed her hand on the head of Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nTo adore each other in the shadows, to love in the plenitude of silence;\r\nwho could not become reconciled to such an eternity?\r\n\r\nOne evening Gwynplaine, feeling within him that overflow of felicity\r\nwhich, like the intoxication of perfumes, causes a sort of delicious\r\nfaintness, was strolling, as he usually did after the performance, in\r\nthe meadow some hundred paces from the Green Box. Sometimes in those\r\nhigh tides of feeling in our souls we feel that we would fain pour out\r\nthe sensations of the overflowing heart. The night was dark but clear.\r\nThe stars were shining. The whole fair-ground was deserted. Sleep and\r\nforgetfulness reigned in the caravans which were scattered over\r\nTarrinzeau Field.\r\n\r\nOne light alone was unextinguished. It was the lamp of the Tadcaster\r\nInn, the door of which was left ajar to admit Gwynplaine on his return.\r\n\r\nMidnight had just struck in the five parishes of Southwark, with the\r\nbreaks and differences of tone of their various bells. Gwynplaine was\r\ndreaming of Dea. Of whom else should he dream? But that evening, feeling\r\nsingularly troubled, and full of a charm which was at the same time a\r\npang, he thought of Dea as a man thinks of a woman. He reproached\r\nhimself for this. It seemed to be failing in respect to her. The\r\nhusband’s attack was forming dimly within him. Sweet and imperious\r\nimpatience! He was crossing the invisible frontier, on this side of\r\nwhich is the virgin, on the other, the wife. He questioned himself\r\nanxiously. A blush, as it were, overspread his mind. The Gwynplaine of\r\nlong ago had been transformed, by degrees, unconsciously in a mysterious\r\ngrowth. His old modesty was becoming misty and uneasy. We have an ear of\r\nlight, into which speaks the spirit; and an ear of darkness, into which\r\nspeaks the instinct. Into the latter strange voices were making their\r\nproposals. However pure-minded may be the youth who dreams of love, a\r\ncertain grossness of the flesh eventually comes between his dream and\r\nhim. Intentions lose their transparency. The unavowed desire implanted\r\nby nature enters into his conscience. Gwynplaine felt an indescribable\r\nyearning of the flesh, which abounds in all temptation, and Dea was\r\nscarcely flesh. In this fever, which he knew to be unhealthy, he\r\ntransfigured Dea into a more material aspect, and tried to exaggerate\r\nher seraphic form into feminine loveliness. It is thou, O woman, that we\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nLove comes not to permit too much of paradise. It requires the fevered\r\nskin, the troubled life, the unbound hair, the kiss electrical and\r\nirreparable, the clasp of desire. The sidereal is embarrassing, the\r\nethereal is heavy. Too much of the heavenly in love is like too much\r\nfuel on a fire: the flame suffers from it. Gwynplaine fell into an\r\nexquisite nightmare; Dea to be clasped in his arms--Dea clasped in them!\r\nHe heard nature in his heart crying out for a woman. Like a Pygmalion in\r\na dream modelling a Galathea out of the azure, in the depths of his soul\r\nhe worked at the chaste contour of Dea--a contour with too much of\r\nheaven, too little of Eden. For Eden is Eve, and Eve was a female, a\r\ncarnal mother, a terrestrial nurse; the sacred womb of generations; the\r\nbreast of unfailing milk; the rocker of the cradle of the newborn world,\r\nand wings are incompatible with the bosom of woman. Virginity is but the\r\nhope of maternity. Still, in Gwynplaine’s dreams, Dea, until now, had\r\nbeen enthroned above flesh. Now, however, he made wild efforts in\r\nthought to draw her downwards by that thread, sex, which ties every girl\r\nto earth. Not one of those birds is free. Dea, like all the rest, was\r\nwithin this law; and Gwynplaine, though he scarcely acknowledged it,\r\nfelt a vague desire that she should submit to it. This desire possessed\r\nhim in spite of himself, and with an ever-recurring relapse. He pictured\r\nDea as woman. He came to the point of regarding her under a hitherto\r\nunheard-of form; as a creature no longer of ecstasy only, but of\r\nvoluptuousness; as Dea, with her head resting on the pillow. He was\r\nashamed of this visionary desecration. It was like an attempt at\r\nprofanation. He resisted its assault. He turned from it, but it returned\r\nagain. He felt as if he were committing a criminal assault. To him Dea\r\nwas encompassed by a cloud. Cleaving that cloud, he shuddered, as though\r\nhe were raising her chemise. It was in April. The spine has its dreams.\r\nHe rambled at random with the uncertain step caused by solitude. To have\r\nno one by is a provocative to wander. Whither flew his thoughts? He\r\nwould not have dared to own it to himself. To heaven? No. To a bed. You\r\nwere looking down upon him, O ye stars.\r\n\r\nWhy talk of a man in love? Rather say a man possessed. To be possessed\r\nby the devil, is the exception; to be possessed by a woman, the rule.\r\nEvery man has to bear this alienation of himself. What a sorceress is a\r\npretty woman! The true name of love is captivity.\r\n\r\nMan is made prisoner by the soul of a woman; by her flesh as well, and\r\nsometimes even more by the flesh than by the soul. The soul is the true\r\nlove, the flesh, the mistress.\r\n\r\nWe slander the devil. It was not he who tempted Eve. It was Eve who\r\ntempted him. The woman began. Lucifer was passing by quietly. He\r\nperceived the woman, and became Satan.\r\n\r\nThe flesh is the cover of the unknown. It is provocative (which is\r\nstrange) by its modesty. Nothing could be more distracting. It is full\r\nof shame, the hussey!\r\n\r\nIt was the terrible love of the surface which was then agitating\r\nGwynplaine, and holding him in its power. Fearful the moment in which\r\nman covets the nakedness of woman! What dark things lurk beneath the\r\nfairness of Venus!\r\n\r\nSomething within him was calling Dea aloud, Dea the maiden, Dea the\r\nother half of a man, Dea flesh and blood, Dea with uncovered bosom. That\r\ncry was almost driving away the angel. Mysterious crisis through which\r\nall love must pass and in which the Ideal is in danger! Therein is the\r\npredestination of Creation. Moment of heavenly corruption! Gwynplaine’s\r\nlove of Dea was becoming nuptial. Virgin love is but a transition. The\r\nmoment was come. Gwynplaine coveted the woman.\r\n\r\nHe coveted a woman!\r\n\r\nPrecipice of which one sees but the first gentle slope!\r\n\r\nThe indistinct summons of nature is inexorable. The whole of woman--what\r\nan abyss!\r\n\r\nLuckily, there was no woman for Gwynplaine but Dea--the only one he\r\ndesired, the only one who could desire him.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine felt that vague and mighty shudder which is the vital claim\r\nof infinity. Besides there was the aggravation of the spring. He was\r\nbreathing the nameless odours of the starry darkness. He walked forward\r\nin a wild feeling of delight. The wandering perfumes of the rising sap,\r\nthe heady irradiations which float in shadow, the distant opening of\r\nnocturnal flowers, the complicity of little hidden nests, the murmurs of\r\nwaters and of leaves, soft sighs rising from all things, the freshness,\r\nthe warmth, and the mysterious awakening of April and May, is the vast\r\ndiffusion of sex murmuring, in whispers, their proposals of\r\nvoluptuousness, till the soul stammers in answer to the giddy\r\nprovocation. The ideal no longer knows what it is saying.\r\n\r\nAny one observing Gwynplaine walk would have said, “See!--a drunken\r\nman!”\r\n\r\nHe almost staggered under the weight of his own heart, of spring, and of\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nThe solitude in the bowling-green was so peaceful that at times he spoke\r\naloud. The consciousness that there is no listener induces speech.\r\n\r\nHe walked with slow steps, his head bent down, his hands behind him, the\r\nleft hand in the right, the fingers open.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he felt something slipped between his fingers.\r\n\r\nHe turned round quickly.\r\n\r\nIn his hand was a paper, and in front of him a man.\r\n\r\nIt was the man who, coming behind him with the stealth of a cat, had\r\nplaced the paper in his fingers.\r\n\r\nThe paper was a letter.\r\n\r\nThe man, as he appeared pretty clearly in the starlight, was small,\r\nchubby-cheeked, young, sedate, and dressed in a scarlet livery, exposed\r\nfrom top to toe through the opening of a long gray cloak, then called a\r\ncapenoche, a Spanish word contracted; in French it was _cape-de-nuit_.\r\nHis head was covered by a crimson cap, like the skull-cap of a cardinal,\r\non which servitude was indicated by a strip of lace. On this cap was a\r\nplume of tisserin feathers. He stood motionless before Gwynplaine, like\r\na dark outline in a dream.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine recognized the duchess’s page.\r\n\r\nBefore Gwynplaine could utter an exclamation of surprise, he heard the\r\nthin voice of the page, at once childlike and feminine in its tone,\r\nsaying to him,--\r\n\r\n“At this hour to-morrow, be at the corner of London Bridge. I will be\r\nthere to conduct you--”\r\n\r\n“Whither?” demanded Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\n“Where you are expected.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine dropped his eyes on the letter, which he was holding\r\nmechanically in his hand.\r\n\r\nWhen he looked up the page was no longer with him.\r\n\r\nHe perceived a vague form lessening rapidly in the distance. It was the\r\nlittle valet. He turned the corner of the street, and solitude reigned\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine saw the page vanish, then looked at the letter. There are\r\nmoments in our lives when what happens seems not to happen. Stupor keeps\r\nus for a moment at a distance from the fact.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine raised the letter to his eyes, as if to read it, but soon\r\nperceived that he could not do so for two reasons--first, because he had\r\nnot broken the seal; and, secondly, because it was too dark.\r\n\r\nIt was some minutes before he remembered that there was a lamp at the\r\ninn. He took a few steps sideways, as if he knew not whither he was\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\nA somnambulist, to whom a phantom had given a letter, might walk as he\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nAt last he made up his mind. He ran rather than walked towards the inn,\r\nstood in the light which broke through the half-open door, and by it\r\nagain examined the closed letter. There was no design on the seal, and\r\non the envelope was written, “_To Gwynplaine_.” He broke the seal, tore\r\nthe envelope, unfolded the letter, put it directly under the light, and\r\nread as follows:--\r\n\r\n“You are hideous; I am beautiful. You are a player; I am a duchess. I am\r\nthe highest; you are the lowest. I desire you! I love you! Come!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FOURTH.\r\n\r\n_THE CELL OF TORTURE._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPTATION OF ST. GWYNPLAINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne jet of flame hardly makes a prick in the darkness; another sets fire\r\nto a volcano.\r\n\r\nSome sparks are gigantic.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine read the letter, then he read it over again. Yes, the words\r\nwere there, “I love you!”\r\n\r\nTerrors chased each other through his mind.\r\n\r\nThe first was, that he believed himself to be mad.\r\n\r\nHe was mad; that was certain: He had just seen what had no existence.\r\nThe twilight spectres were making game of him, poor wretch! The little\r\nman in scarlet was the will-o’-the-wisp of a dream. Sometimes, at night,\r\nnothings condensed into flame come and laugh at us. Having had his laugh\r\nout, the visionary being had disappeared, and left Gwynplaine behind\r\nhim, mad.\r\n\r\nSuch are the freaks of darkness.\r\n\r\nThe second terror was, to find out that he was in his right senses.\r\n\r\nA vision? Certainly not. How could that be? Had he not a letter in his\r\nhand? Did he not see an envelope, a seal, paper, and writing? Did he not\r\nknow from whom that came? It was all clear enough. Some one took a pen\r\nand ink, and wrote. Some one lighted a taper, and sealed it with wax.\r\nWas not his name written on the letter--“_To Gwynplaine_?” The paper was\r\nscented. All was clear.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine knew the little man. The dwarf was a page. The gleam was a\r\nlivery. The page had given him a rendezvous for the same hour on the\r\nmorrow, at the corner of London Bridge.\r\n\r\nWas London Bridge an illusion?\r\n\r\nNo, no. All was clear. There was no delirium. All was reality.\r\nGwynplaine was perfectly clear in his intellect. It was not a\r\nphantasmagoria, suddenly dissolving above his head, and fading into\r\nnothingness. It was something which had really happened to him. No,\r\nGwynplaine was not mad, nor was he dreaming. Again he read the letter.\r\n\r\nWell, yes! But then?\r\n\r\nThat then was terror-striking.\r\n\r\nThere was a woman who desired him! If so, let no one ever again\r\npronounce the word incredible! A woman desire him! A woman who had seen\r\nhis face! A woman who was not blind! And who was this woman? An ugly\r\none? No; a beauty. A gipsy? No; a duchess!\r\n\r\nWhat was it all about, and what could it all mean? What peril in such a\r\ntriumph! And how was he to help plunging into it headlong?\r\n\r\nWhat! that woman! The siren, the apparition, the lady in the visionary\r\nbox, the light in the darkness! It was she! Yes; it was she!\r\n\r\nThe crackling of the fire burst out in every part of his frame. It was\r\nthe strange, unknown lady, she who had previously so troubled his\r\nthoughts; and his first tumultuous feelings about this woman returned,\r\nheated by the evil fire. Forgetfulness is nothing but a palimpsest: an\r\nincident happens unexpectedly, and all that was effaced revives in the\r\nblanks of wondering memory.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine thought that he had dismissed that image from his\r\nremembrance, and he found that it was still there; and she had put her\r\nmark in his brain, unconsciously guilty of a dream. Without his\r\nsuspecting it, the lines of the engraving had been bitten deep by\r\nreverie. And now a certain amount of evil had been done, and this train\r\nof thought, thenceforth, perhaps, irreparable, he took up again eagerly.\r\nWhat! she desired him! What! the princess descend from her throne, the\r\nidol from its shrine, the statue from its pedestal, the phantom from its\r\ncloud! What! from the depths of the impossible had this chimera come!\r\nThis deity of the sky! This irradiation! This nereid all glistening\r\nwith jewels! This proud and unattainable beauty, from the height of her\r\nradiant throne, was bending down to Gwynplaine! What! had she drawn up\r\nher chariot of the dawn, with its yoke of turtle-doves and dragons,\r\nbefore Gwynplaine, and said to him, “Come!” What! this terrible glory of\r\nbeing the object of such abasement from the empyrean, for Gwynplaine!\r\nThis woman, if he could give that name to a form so starlike and\r\nmajestic, this woman proposed herself, gave herself, delivered herself\r\nup to him! Wonder of wonders! A goddess prostituting herself for him!\r\nThe arms of a courtesan opening in a cloud to clasp him to the bosom of\r\na goddess, and that without degradation! Such majestic creatures cannot\r\nbe sullied. The gods bathe themselves pure in light; and this goddess\r\nwho came to him knew what she was doing. She was not ignorant of the\r\nincarnate hideousness of Gwynplaine. She had seen the mask which was his\r\nface; and that mask had not caused her to draw back. Gwynplaine was\r\nloved notwithstanding it!\r\n\r\nHere was a thing surpassing all the extravagance of dreams. He was loved\r\nin consequence of his mask. Far from repulsing the goddess, the mask\r\nattracted her. Gwynplaine was not only loved; he was desired. He was\r\nmore than accepted; he was chosen. He, chosen!\r\n\r\nWhat! there, where this woman dwelt, in the regal region of\r\nirresponsible splendour, and in the power of full, free will; where\r\nthere were princes, and she could take a prince; nobles, and she could\r\ntake a noble; where there were men handsome, charming, magnificent, and\r\nshe could take an Adonis: whom did she take? Gnafron! She could choose\r\nfrom the midst of meteors and thunders, the mighty six-winged seraphim,\r\nand she chose the larva crawling in the slime. On one side were\r\nhighnesses and peers, all grandeur, all opulence, all glory; on the\r\nother, a mountebank. The mountebank carried it! What kind of scales\r\ncould there be in the heart of this woman? By what measure did she weigh\r\nher love? She took off her ducal coronet, and flung it on the platform\r\nof a clown! She took from her brow the Olympian aureola, and placed it\r\non the bristly head of a gnome! The world had turned topsy-turvy. The\r\ninsects swarmed on high, the stars were scattered below, whilst the\r\nwonder-stricken Gwynplaine, overwhelmed by a falling ruin of light, and\r\nlying in the dust, was enshrined in a glory. One all-powerful,\r\nrevolting against beauty and splendour, gave herself to the damned of\r\nnight; preferred Gwynplaine to Antinoüs; excited by curiosity, she\r\nentered the shadows, and descending within them, and from this\r\nabdication of goddess-ship was rising, crowned and prodigious, the\r\nroyalty of the wretched. “You are hideous. I love you.” These words\r\ntouched Gwynplaine in the ugly spot of pride. Pride is the heel in which\r\nall heroes are vulnerable. Gwynplaine was flattered in his vanity as a\r\nmonster. He was loved for his deformity. He, too, was the exception, as\r\nmuch and perhaps more than the Jupiters and the Apollos. He felt\r\nsuperhuman, and so much a monster as to be a god. Fearful bewilderment!\r\n\r\nNow, who was this woman? What did he know about her? Everything and\r\nnothing. She was a duchess, that he knew; he knew, also, that she was\r\nbeautiful and rich; that she had liveries, lackeys, pages, and footmen\r\nrunning with torches by the side of her coroneted carriage. He knew that\r\nshe was in love with him; at least she said so. Of everything else he\r\nwas ignorant. He knew her title, but not her name. He knew her thought;\r\nhe knew not her life. Was she married, widow, maiden? Was she free? Of\r\nwhat family was she? Were there snares, traps, dangers about her? Of the\r\ngallantry existing on the idle heights of society; the caves on those\r\nsummits, in which savage charmers dream amid the scattered skeletons of\r\nthe loves which they have already preyed on; of the extent of tragic\r\ncynicism to which the experiments of a woman may attain who believes\r\nherself to be beyond the reach of man--of things such as these\r\nGwynplaine had no idea. Nor had he even in his mind materials out of\r\nwhich to build up a conjecture, information concerning such things being\r\nvery scanty in the social depths in which he lived. Still he detected a\r\nshadow; he felt that a mist hung over all this brightness. Did he\r\nunderstand it? No. Could he guess at it? Still less. What was there\r\nbehind that letter? One pair of folding doors opening before him,\r\nanother closing on him, and causing him a vague anxiety. On the one side\r\nan avowal; on the other an enigma--avowal and enigma, which, like two\r\nmouths, one tempting, the other threatening, pronounce the same word,\r\nDare!\r\n\r\nNever had perfidious chance taken its measures better, nor timed more\r\nfitly the moment of temptation. Gwynplaine, stirred by spring, and by\r\nthe sap rising in all things, was prompt to dream the dream of the\r\nflesh. The old man who is not to be stamped out, and over whom none of\r\nus can triumph, was awaking in that backward youth, still a boy at\r\ntwenty-four.\r\n\r\nIt was just then, at the most stormy moment of the crisis, that the\r\noffer was made him, and the naked bosom of the Sphinx appeared before\r\nhis dazzled eyes. Youth is an inclined plane. Gwynplaine was stooping,\r\nand something pushed him forward. What? the season, and the night. Who?\r\nthe woman.\r\n\r\nWere there no month of April, man would be a great deal more virtuous.\r\nThe budding plants are a set of accomplices! Love is the thief, Spring\r\nthe receiver.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine was shaken.\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of smoke of evil, preceding sin, in which the conscience\r\ncannot breathe. The obscure nausea of hell comes over virtue in\r\ntemptation. The yawning abyss discharges an exhalation which warns the\r\nstrong and turns the weak giddy. Gwynplaine was suffering its mysterious\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nDilemmas, transient and at the same time stubborn, were floating before\r\nhim. Sin, presenting itself obstinately again and again to his mind, was\r\ntaking form. The morrow, midnight? London Bridge, the page? Should he\r\ngo? “Yes,” cried the flesh; “No,” cried the soul.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we must remark that, strange as it may appear at first\r\nsight, he never once put himself the question, “Should he go?” quite\r\ndistinctly. Reprehensible actions are like over-strong brandies--you\r\ncannot swallow them at a draught. You put down your glass; you will see\r\nto it presently; there is a strange taste even about that first drop.\r\nOne thing is certain: he felt something behind him pushing him, forward\r\ntowards the unknown. And he trembled. He could catch a glimpse of a\r\ncrumbling precipice, and he drew back, stricken by the terror encircling\r\nhim. He closed his eyes. He tried hard to deny to himself that the\r\nadventure had ever occurred, and to persuade himself into doubting his\r\nreason. This was evidently his best plan; the wisest thing he could do\r\nwas to believe himself mad.\r\n\r\nFatal fever! Every man, surprised by the unexpected, has at times felt\r\nthe throb of such tragic pulsations. The observer ever listens with\r\nanxiety to the echoes resounding from the dull strokes of the\r\nbattering-ram of destiny striking against a conscience.\r\n\r\nAlas! Gwynplaine put himself questions. Where duty is clear, to put\r\noneself questions is to suffer defeat.\r\n\r\nThere are invasions which the mind may have to suffer. There are the\r\nVandals of the soul--evil thoughts coming to devastate our virtue. A\r\nthousand contrary ideas rushed into Gwynplaine’s brain, now following\r\neach other singly, now crowding together. Then silence reigned again,\r\nand he would lean his head on his hands, in a kind of mournful\r\nattention, as of one who contemplates a landscape by night.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he felt that he was no longer thinking. His reverie had reached\r\nthat point of utter darkness in which all things disappear.\r\n\r\nHe remembered, too, that he had not entered the inn. It might be about\r\ntwo o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nHe placed the letter which the page had brought him in his side-pocket;\r\nbut perceiving that it was next his heart, he drew it out again,\r\ncrumpled it up, and placed it in a pocket of his hose. He then directed\r\nhis steps towards the inn, which he entered stealthily, and without\r\nawaking little Govicum, who, while waiting up for him, had fallen asleep\r\non the table, with his arms for a pillow. He closed the door, lighted a\r\ncandle at the lamp, fastened the bolt, turned the key in the lock,\r\ntaking, mechanically, all the precautions usual to a man returning home\r\nlate, ascended the staircase of the Green Box, slipped into the old\r\nhovel which he used as a bedroom, looked at Ursus who was asleep, blew\r\nout his candle, and did not go to bed.\r\n\r\nThus an hour passed away. Weary, at length, and fancying that bed and\r\nsleep were one, he laid his head upon the pillow without undressing,\r\nmaking darkness the concession of closing his eyes. But the storm of\r\nemotions which assailed him had not waned for an instant. Sleeplessness\r\nis a cruelty which night inflicts on man. Gwynplaine suffered greatly.\r\nFor the first time in his life, he was not pleased with himself. Ache of\r\nheart mingled with gratified vanity. What was he to do? Day broke at\r\nlast; he heard Ursus get up, but did not raise his eyelids. No truce for\r\nhim, however. The letter was ever in his mind. Every word of it came\r\nback to him in a kind of chaos. In certain violent storms within the\r\nsoul thought becomes a liquid. It is convulsed, it heaves, and\r\nsomething rises from it, like the dull roaring of the waves. Flood and\r\nflow, sudden shocks and whirls, the hesitation of the wave before the\r\nrock; hail and rain clouds with the light shining through their breaks;\r\nthe petty flights of useless foam; wild swell broken in an instant;\r\ngreat efforts lost; wreck appearing all around; darkness and universal\r\ndispersion--as these things are of the sea, so are they of man.\r\nGwynplaine was a prey to such a storm.\r\n\r\nAt the acme of his agony, his eyes still closed, he heard an exquisite\r\nvoice saying, “Are you asleep, Gwynplaine?” He opened his eyes with a\r\nstart, and sat up. Dea was standing in the half-open doorway. Her\r\nineffable smile was in her eyes and on her lips. She was standing there,\r\ncharming in the unconscious serenity of her radiance. Then came, as it\r\nwere, a sacred moment. Gwynplaine watched her, startled, dazzled,\r\nawakened. Awakened from what?--from sleep? no, from sleeplessness. It\r\nwas she, it was Dea; and suddenly he felt in the depths of his being the\r\nindescribable wane of the storm and the sublime descent of good over\r\nevil; the miracle of the look from on high was accomplished; the blind\r\ngirl, the sweet light-bearer, with no effort beyond her mere presence,\r\ndissipated all the darkness within him; the curtain of cloud was\r\ndispersed from the soul as if drawn by an invisible hand, and a sky of\r\nazure, as though by celestial enchantment, again spread over\r\nGwynplaine’s conscience. In a moment he became by the virtue of that\r\nangel, the great and good Gwynplaine, the innocent man. Such mysterious\r\nconfrontations occur to the soul as they do to creation. Both were\r\nsilent--she, who was the light; he, who was the abyss; she, who was\r\ndivine; he, who was appeased; and over Gwynplaine’s stormy heart Dea\r\nshone with the indescribable effect of a star shining on the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFROM GAY TO GRAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow simple is a miracle! It was breakfast hour in the Green Box, and Dea\r\nhad merely come to see why Gwynplaine had not joined their little\r\nbreakfast table.\r\n\r\n“It is you!” exclaimed Gwynplaine; and he had said everything. There was\r\nno other horizon, no vision for him now but the heavens where Dea was.\r\nHis mind was appeased--appeased in such a manner as he alone can\r\nunderstand who has seen the smile spread swiftly over the sea when the\r\nhurricane had passed away. Over nothing does the calm come so quickly as\r\nover the whirlpool. This results from its power of absorption. And so it\r\nis with the human heart. Not always, however.\r\n\r\nDea had but to show herself, and all the light that was in Gwynplaine\r\nleft him and went to her, and behind the dazzled Gwynplaine there was\r\nbut a flight of phantoms. What a peacemaker is adoration! A few minutes\r\nafterwards they were sitting opposite each other, Ursus between them,\r\nHomo at their feet. The teapot, hung over a little lamp, was on the\r\ntable. Fibi and Vinos were outside, waiting.\r\n\r\nThey breakfasted as they supped, in the centre compartment. From the\r\nposition in which the narrow table was placed, Dea’s back was turned\r\ntowards the aperture in the partition which was opposite the entrance\r\ndoor of the Green Box. Their knees were touching. Gwynplaine was pouring\r\nout tea for Dea. Dea blew gracefully on her cup. Suddenly she sneezed.\r\nJust at that moment a thin smoke rose above the flame of the lamp, and\r\nsomething like a piece of paper fell into ashes. It was the smoke which\r\nhad caused Dea to sneeze.\r\n\r\n“What was that?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” replied Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nAnd he smiled. He had just burnt the duchess’s letter.\r\n\r\nThe conscience of the man who loves is the guardian angel of the woman\r\nwhom he loves.\r\n\r\nUnburdened of the letter, his relief was wondrous, and Gwynplaine felt\r\nhis integrity as the eagle feels its wings.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him as if his temptation had evaporated with the smoke, and\r\nas if the duchess had crumbled into ashes with the paper.\r\n\r\nTaking up their cups at random, and drinking one after the other from\r\nthe same one, they talked. A babble of lovers, a chattering of sparrows!\r\nChild’s talk, worthy of Mother Goose or of Homer! With two loving\r\nhearts, go no further for poetry; with two kisses for dialogue, go no\r\nfurther for music.\r\n\r\n“Do you know something?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine, I dreamt that we were animals, and had wings.”\r\n\r\n“Wings; that means birds,” murmured Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\n“Fools! it means angels,” growled Ursus.\r\n\r\nAnd their talk went on.\r\n\r\n“If you did not exist, Gwynplaine?”\r\n\r\n“What then?”\r\n\r\n“It could only be because there was no God.”\r\n\r\n“The tea is too hot; you will burn yourself, Dea.”\r\n\r\n“Blow on my cup.”\r\n\r\n“How beautiful you are this morning!”\r\n\r\n“Do you know that I have a great many things to say to you?”\r\n\r\n“Say them.”\r\n\r\n“I love you.”\r\n\r\n“I adore you.”\r\n\r\nAnd Ursus said aside, “By heaven, they are polite!”\r\n\r\nExquisite to lovers are their moments of silence! In them they gather,\r\nas it were, masses of love, which afterwards explode into sweet\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\n“Do you know! In the evening, when we are playing our parts, at the\r\nmoment when my hand touches your forehead--oh, what a noble head is\r\nyours, Gwynplaine!--at the moment when I feel your hair under my\r\nfingers, I shiver; a heavenly joy comes over me, and I say to myself, In\r\nall this world of darkness which encompasses me, in this universe of\r\nsolitude, in this great obscurity of ruin in which I am, in this quaking\r\nfear of myself and of everything, I have one prop; and he is there. It\r\nis he--it is you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! you love me,” said Gwynplaine. “I, too, have but you on earth. You\r\nare all in all to me. Dea, what would you have me do? What do you\r\ndesire? What do you want?”\r\n\r\nDea answered,--\r\n\r\n“I do not know. I am happy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” replied Gwynplaine, “we are happy.”\r\n\r\nUrsus raised his voice severely,--\r\n\r\n“Oh, you are happy, are you? That’s a crime. I have warned you already.\r\nYou are happy! Then take care you aren’t seen. Take up as little room as\r\nyou can. Happiness ought to stuff itself into a hole. Make yourselves\r\nstill less than you are, if that can be. God measures the greatness of\r\nhappiness by the littleness of the happy. The happy should conceal\r\nthemselves like malefactors. Oh, only shine out like the wretched\r\nglowworms that you are, and you’ll be trodden on; and quite right too!\r\nWhat do you mean by all that love-making nonsense? I’m no duenna, whose\r\nbusiness it is to watch lovers billing and cooing. I’m tired of it all,\r\nI tell you; and you may both go to the devil.”\r\n\r\nAnd feeling that his harsh tones were melting into tenderness, he\r\ndrowned his emotion in a loud grumble.\r\n\r\n“Father,” said Dea, “how roughly you scold!”\r\n\r\n“It’s because I don’t like to see people too happy.”\r\n\r\nHere Homo re-echoed Ursus. His growl was heard from beneath the lovers’\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nUrsus stooped down, and placed his hand on Homo’s head.\r\n\r\n“That’s right; you’re in bad humour, too. You growl. The bristles are\r\nall on end on your wolf’s pate. You don’t like all this love-making.\r\nThat’s because you are wise. Hold your tongue, all the same. You have\r\nhad your say and given your opinion; be it so. Now be silent.”\r\n\r\nThe wolf growled again. Ursus looked under the table at him.\r\n\r\n“Be still, Homo! Come, don’t dwell on it, you philosopher!”\r\n\r\nBut the wolf sat up, and looked towards the door, showing his teeth.\r\n\r\n“What’s wrong with you now?” said Ursus. And he caught hold of Homo by\r\nthe skin of the neck.\r\n\r\nHeedless of the wolf’s growls, and wholly wrapped up in her own thoughts\r\nand in the sound of Gwynplaine’s voice, which left its after-taste\r\nwithin her, Dea was silent, and absorbed by that kind of esctasy\r\npeculiar to the blind, which seems at times to give them a song to\r\nlisten to in their souls, and to make up to them for the light which\r\nthey lack by some strain of ideal music. Blindness is a cavern, to which\r\nreaches the deep harmony of the Eternal.\r\n\r\nWhile Ursus, addressing Homo, was looking down, Gwynplaine had raised\r\nhis eyes. He was about to drink a cup of tea, but did not drink it. He\r\nplaced it on the table with the slow movement of a spring drawn back;\r\nhis fingers remained open, his eyes fixed. He scarcely breathed.\r\n\r\nA man was standing in the doorway, behind Dea. He was clad in black,\r\nwith a hood. He wore a wig down to his eyebrows, and held in his hand\r\nan iron staff with a crown at each end. His staff was short and massive.\r\nHe was like Medusa thrusting her head between two branches in Paradise.\r\n\r\nUrsus, who had heard some one enter and raised his head without loosing\r\nhis hold of Homo, recognized the terrible personage. He shook from head\r\nto foot, and whispered to Gwynplaine,--\r\n\r\n“It’s the wapentake.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine recollected. An exclamation of surprise was about to escape\r\nhim, but he restrained it. The iron staff, with the crown at each end,\r\nwas called the iron weapon. It was from this iron weapon, upon which the\r\ncity officers of justice took the oath when they entered on their\r\nduties, that the old wapentakes of the English police derived their\r\nqualification.\r\n\r\nBehind the man in the wig, the frightened landlord could just be\r\nperceived in the shadow.\r\n\r\nWithout saying a word, a personification of the Muta Themis of the old\r\ncharters, the man stretched his right arm over the radiant Dea, and\r\ntouched Gwynplaine on the shoulder with the iron staff, at the same time\r\npointing with his left thumb to the door of the Green Box behind him.\r\nThese gestures, all the more imperious for their silence, meant, “Follow\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n_Pro signo exeundi, sursum trahe_, says the old Norman record.\r\n\r\nHe who was touched by the iron weapon had no right but the right of\r\nobedience. To that mute order there was no reply. The harsh penalties of\r\nthe English law threatened the refractory. Gwynplaine felt a shock under\r\nthe rigid touch of the law; then he sat as though petrified.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of having been merely grazed on the shoulder, he had been\r\nstruck a violent blow on the head with the iron staff, he could not have\r\nbeen more stunned. He knew that the police-officer summoned him to\r\nfollow; but why? _That_ he could not understand.\r\n\r\nOn his part Ursus, too, was thrown into the most painful agitation, but\r\nhe saw through matters pretty distinctly. His thoughts ran on the\r\njugglers and preachers, his competitors, on informations laid against\r\nthe Green Box, on that delinquent the wolf, on his own affair with the\r\nthree Bishopsgate commissioners, and who knows?--perhaps--but that\r\nwould be too fearful--Gwynplaine’s unbecoming and factious speeches\r\ntouching the royal authority.\r\n\r\nHe trembled violently.\r\n\r\nDea was smiling.\r\n\r\nNeither Gwynplaine nor Ursus pronounced a word. They had both the same\r\nthought--not to frighten Dea. It may have struck the wolf as well, for\r\nhe ceased growling. True, Ursus did not loose him.\r\n\r\nHomo, however, was a prudent wolf when occasion required. Who is there\r\nwho has not remarked a kind of intelligent anxiety in animals? It may be\r\nthat to the extent to which a wolf can understand mankind he felt that\r\nhe was an outlaw.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine rose.\r\n\r\nResistance was impracticable, as Gwynplaine knew. He remembered Ursus’s\r\nwords, and there was no question possible. He remained standing in front\r\nof the wapentake. The latter raised the iron staff from Gwynplaine’s\r\nshoulder, and drawing it back, held it out straight in an attitude of\r\ncommand--a constable’s attitude which was well understood in those days\r\nby the whole people, and which expressed the following order: “Let this\r\nman, and no other, follow me. The rest remain where they are. Silence!”\r\n\r\nNo curious followers were allowed. In all times the police have had a\r\ntaste for arrests of the kind. This description of seizure was termed\r\nsequestration of the person.\r\n\r\nThe wapentake turned round in one motion, like a piece of mechanism\r\nrevolving on its own pivot, and with grave and magisterial step\r\nproceeded towards the door of the Green Box.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine looked at Ursus. The latter went through a pantomime composed\r\nas follows: he shrugged his shoulders, placed both elbows close to his\r\nhips, with his hands out, and knitted his brows into chevrons--all which\r\nsignifies, “We must submit to the unknown.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine looked at Dea. She was in her dream. She was still smiling.\r\nHe put the ends of his fingers to his lips, and sent her an unutterable\r\nkiss.\r\n\r\nUrsus, relieved of some portion of his terror now that the wapentake’s\r\nback was turned, seized the moment to whisper in Gwynplaine’s ear,--\r\n\r\n“On your life, do not speak until you are questioned.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, with the same care to make no noise as he would have taken\r\nin a sickroom, took his hat and cloak from the hook on the partition,\r\nwrapped himself up to the eyes in the cloak, and pushed his hat over his\r\nforehead. Not having been to bed, he had his working clothes still on,\r\nand his leather esclavin round his neck. Once more he looked at Dea.\r\nHaving reached the door, the wapentake raised his staff and began to\r\ndescend the steps; then Gwynplaine set out as if the man was dragging\r\nhim by an invisible chain. Ursus watched Gwynplaine leave the Green Box.\r\nAt that moment the wolf gave a low growl; but Ursus silenced him, and\r\nwhispered, “He is coming back.”\r\n\r\nIn the yard, Master Nicless was stemming, with servile and imperious\r\ngestures, the cries of terror raised by Vinos and Fibi, as in great\r\ndistress they watched Gwynplaine led away, and the mourning-coloured\r\ngarb and the iron staff of the wapentake.\r\n\r\nThe two girls were like petrifactions: they were in the attitude of\r\nstalactites. Govicum, stunned, was looking open-mouthed out of a window.\r\n\r\nThe wapentake preceded Gwynplaine by a few steps, never turning round or\r\nlooking at him, in that icy ease which is given by the knowledge that\r\none is the law.\r\n\r\nIn death-like silence they both crossed the yard, went through the dark\r\ntaproom, and reached the street. A few passers-by had collected about\r\nthe inn door, and the justice of the quorum was there at the head of a\r\nsquad of police. The idlers, stupefied, and without breathing a word,\r\nopened out and stood aside, with English discipline, at the sight of the\r\nconstable’s staff. The wapentake moved off in the direction of the\r\nnarrow street then called the Little Strand, running by the Thames; and\r\nGwynplaine, with the justice of the quorum’s men in ranks on each side,\r\nlike a double hedge, pale, without a motion except that of his steps,\r\nwrapped in his cloak as in a shroud, was leaving the inn farther and\r\nfarther behind him as he followed the silent man, like a statue\r\nfollowing a spectre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nLEX, REX, FEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnexplained arrest, which would greatly astonish an Englishman nowadays,\r\nwas then a very usual proceeding of the police. Recourse was had to it,\r\nnotwithstanding the Habeas Corpus Act, up to George II.’s time,\r\nespecially in such delicate cases as were provided for by _lettres de\r\ncachet_ in France; and one of the accusations against which Walpole had\r\nto defend himself was that he had caused or allowed Neuhoff to be\r\narrested in that manner. The accusation was probably without foundation,\r\nfor Neuhoff, King of Corsica, was put in prison by his creditors.\r\n\r\nThese silent captures of the person, very usual with the Holy Væhme in\r\nGermany, were admitted by German custom, which rules one half of the old\r\nEnglish laws, and recommended in certain cases by Norman custom, which\r\nrules the other half. Justinian’s chief of the palace police was called\r\n“_silentiarius imperialis_.” The English magistrates who practised the\r\ncaptures in question relied upon numerous Norman texts:--_Canes latrant,\r\nsergentes silent. Sergenter agere, id est tacere_. They quoted\r\nLundulphus Sagax, paragraph 16: _Facit imperator silentium_. They quoted\r\nthe charter of King Philip in 1307: _Multos tenebimus bastonerios qui,\r\nobmutescentes, sergentare valeant_. They quoted the statutes of Henry I.\r\nof England, cap. 53: _Surge signo jussus. Taciturnior esto. Hoc est esse\r\nin captione regis_. They took advantage especially of the following\r\ndescription, held to form part of the ancient feudal franchises of\r\nEngland:--“Sous les viscomtes sont les serjans de l’espée, lesquels\r\ndoivent justicier vertueusement à l’espée tous ceux qui suient malveses\r\ncompagnies, gens diffamez d’aucuns crimes, et gens fuites et\r\nforbannis.... et les doivent si vigoureusement et discrètement\r\nappréhender, que la bonne gent qui sont paisibles soient gardez\r\npaisiblement et que les malfeteurs soient espoantés.” To be thus\r\narrested was to be seized “à le glaive de l’espée.” (_Vetus Consuetudo\r\nNormanniæ_, MS. part I, sect. I, ch. 11.) The jurisconsults referred\r\nbesides “_in Charta Ludovici Hutum pro Normannis_, chapter _Servientes\r\nspathæ_.” _Servientes spathæ_, in the gradual approach of base Latin\r\nto our idioms, became _sergentes spadæ_.\r\n\r\nThese silent arrests were the contrary of the _Clameur de Haro_, and\r\ngave warning that it was advisable to hold one’s tongue until such time\r\nas light should be thrown upon certain matters still in the dark. They\r\nsignified questions reserved, and showed in the operation of the police\r\na certain amount of _raison d’état_.\r\n\r\nThe legal term “private” was applied to arrests of this description. It\r\nwas thus that Edward III., according to some chroniclers, caused\r\nMortimer to be seized in the bed of his mother, Isabella of France.\r\nThis, again, we may take leave to doubt; for Mortimer sustained a siege\r\nin his town before being captured.\r\n\r\nWarwick, the king-maker, delighted in practising this mode of “attaching\r\npeople.” Cromwell made use of it, especially in Connaught; and it was\r\nwith this precaution of silence that Trailie Arcklo, a relation of the\r\nEarl of Ormond, was arrested at Kilmacaugh.\r\n\r\nThese captures of the body by the mere motion of justice represented\r\nrather the _mandat de comparution_ than the warrant of arrest. Sometimes\r\nthey were but processes of inquiry, and even argued, by the silence\r\nimposed upon all, a certain consideration for the person seized. For the\r\nmass of the people, little versed as they were in the estimate of such\r\nshades of difference, they had peculiar terrors.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that in 1705, and even much later, England was\r\nfar from being what she is to-day. The general features of its\r\nconstitution were confused and at times very oppressive. Daniel Defoe,\r\nwho had himself had a taste of the pillory, characterizes the social\r\norder of England, somewhere in his writings, as the “iron hands of the\r\nlaw.” There was not only the law; there was its arbitrary\r\nadministration. We have but to recall Steele, ejected from Parliament;\r\nLocke, driven from his chair; Hobbes and Gibbon, compelled to flight;\r\nCharles Churchill, Hume, and Priestley, persecuted; John Wilkes sent to\r\nthe Tower. The task would be a long one, were we to count over the\r\nvictims of the statute against seditious libel. The Inquisition had, to\r\nsome extent, spread its arrangements throughout Europe, and its police\r\npractice was taken as a guide. A monstrous attempt against all rights\r\nwas possible in England. We have only to recall the _Gazetier Cuirassé_.\r\nIn the midst of the eighteenth century, Louis XV. had writers, whose\r\nworks displeased him, arrested in Piccadilly. It is true that George II.\r\nlaid his hands on the Pretender in France, right in the middle of the\r\nhall at the opera. Those were two long arms--that of the King of France\r\nreaching London; that of the King of England, Paris! Such was the\r\nliberty of the period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nURSUS SPIES THE POLICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have already said, according to the very severe laws of the police\r\nof those days, the summons to follow the wapentake, addressed to an\r\nindividual, implied to all other persons present the command not to\r\nstir.\r\n\r\nSome curious idlers, however, were stubborn, and followed from afar off\r\nthe _cortège_ which had taken Gwynplaine into custody.\r\n\r\nUrsus was of them. He had been as nearly petrified as any one has a\r\nright to be. But Ursus, so often assailed by the surprises incident to a\r\nwandering life, and by the malice of chance, was, like a ship-of-war,\r\nprepared for action, and could call to the post of danger the whole\r\ncrew--that is to say, the aid of all his intelligence.\r\n\r\nHe flung off his stupor and began to think. He strove not to give way to\r\nemotion, but to stand face to face with circumstances.\r\n\r\nTo look fortune in the face is the duty of every one not an idiot; to\r\nseek not to understand, but to act.\r\n\r\nPresently he asked himself, What could he do?\r\n\r\nGwynplaine being taken, Ursus was placed between two terrors--a fear for\r\nGwynplaine, which instigated him to follow; and a fear for himself,\r\nwhich urged him to remain where he was.\r\n\r\nUrsus had the intrepidity of a fly and the impassibility of a sensitive\r\nplant. His agitation was not to be described. However, he took his\r\nresolution heroically, and decided to brave the law, and to follow the\r\nwapentake, so anxious was he concerning the fate of Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nHis terror must have been great to prompt so much courage.\r\n\r\nTo what valiant acts will not fear drive a hare!\r\n\r\nThe chamois in despair jumps a precipice. To be terrified into\r\nimprudence is one of the forms of fear.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine had been carried off rather than arrested. The operation of\r\nthe police had been executed so rapidly that the Fair field, generally\r\nlittle frequented at that hour of the morning, had scarcely taken\r\ncognizance of the circumstance.\r\n\r\nScarcely any one in the caravans had any idea that the wapentake had\r\ncome to take Gwynplaine. Hence the smallness of the crowd.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, thanks to his cloak and his hat, which nearly concealed his\r\nface, could not be recognized by the passers-by.\r\n\r\nBefore he went out to follow Gwynplaine, Ursus took a precaution. He\r\nspoke to Master Nicless, to the boy Govicum, and to Fibi and Vinos, and\r\ninsisted on their keeping absolute silence before Dea, who was ignorant\r\nof everything. That they should not utter a syllable that could make her\r\nsuspect what had occurred; that they should make her understand that the\r\ncares of the management of the Green Box necessitated the absence of\r\nGwynplaine and Ursus; that, besides, it would soon be the time of her\r\ndaily siesta, and that before she awoke he and Gwynplaine would have\r\nreturned; that all that had taken place had arisen from a mistake; that\r\nit would be very easy for Gwynplaine and himself to clear themselves\r\nbefore the magistrate and police; that a touch of the finger would put\r\nthe matter straight, after which they should both return; above all,\r\nthat no one should say a word on the subject to Dea. Having given these\r\ndirections he departed.\r\n\r\nUrsus was able to follow Gwynplaine without being remarked. Though he\r\nkept at the greatest possible distance, he so managed as not to lose\r\nsight of him. Boldness in ambuscade is the bravery of the timid.\r\n\r\nAfter all, notwithstanding the solemnity of the attendant circumstances,\r\nGwynplaine might have been summoned before the magistrate for some\r\nunimportant infraction of the law.\r\n\r\nUrsus assured himself that the question would be decided at once.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the mystery would be made under his very eyes by the\r\ndirection taken by the _cortège_ which took Gwynplaine from Tarrinzeau\r\nField when it reached the entrance of the lanes of the Little Strand.\r\n\r\nIf it turned to the left, it would conduct Gwynplaine to the justice\r\nhall in Southwark. In that case there would be little to fear, some\r\ntrifling municipal offence, an admonition from the magistrate, two or\r\nthree shillings to pay, and Gwynplaine would be set at liberty, and the\r\nrepresentation of “Chaos Vanquished” would take place in the evening as\r\nusual. In that case no one would know that anything unusual had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nIf the _cortège_ turned to the right, matters would be serious.\r\n\r\nThere were frightful places in that direction.\r\n\r\nWhen the wapentake, leading the file of soldiers between whom Gwynplaine\r\nwalked, arrived at the small streets, Ursus watched them breathlessly.\r\nThere are moments in which a man’s whole being passes into his eyes.\r\n\r\nWhich way were they going to turn?\r\n\r\nThey turned to the right.\r\n\r\nUrsus, staggering with terror, leant against a wall that he might not\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nThere is no hypocrisy so great as the words which we say to ourselves,\r\n“_I wish to know the worst_!” At heart we do not wish it at all. We have\r\na dreadful fear of knowing it. Agony is mingled with a dim effort not to\r\nsee the end. We do not own it to ourselves, but we would draw back if we\r\ndared; and when we have advanced, we reproach ourselves for having done\r\nso.\r\n\r\nThus did Ursus. He shuddered as he thought,--\r\n\r\n“Here are things going wrong. I should have found it out soon enough.\r\nWhat business had I to follow Gwynplaine?”\r\n\r\nHaving made this reflection, man being but self-contradiction, he\r\nincreased his pace, and, mastering his anxiety, hastened to get nearer\r\nthe _cortège_, so as not to break, in the maze of small streets, the\r\nthread between Gwynplaine and himself.\r\n\r\nThe _cortège_ of police could not move quickly, on account of its\r\nsolemnity.\r\n\r\nThe wapentake led it.\r\n\r\nThe justice of the quorum closed it.\r\n\r\nThis order compelled a certain deliberation of movement.\r\n\r\nAll the majesty possible in an official shone in the justice of the\r\nquorum. His costume held a middle place between the splendid robe of a\r\ndoctor of music of Oxford and the sober black habiliments of a doctor of\r\ndivinity of Cambridge. He wore the dress of a gentleman under a long\r\n_godebert_, which is a mantle trimmed with the fur of the Norwegian\r\nhare. He was half Gothic and half modern, wearing a wig like Lamoignon,\r\nand sleeves like Tristan l’Hermite. His great round eye watched\r\nGwynplaine with the fixedness of an owl’s.\r\n\r\nHe walked with a cadence. Never did honest man look fiercer.\r\n\r\nUrsus, for a moment thrown out of his way in the tangled skein of\r\nstreets, overtook, close to Saint Mary Overy, the _cortège_, which had\r\nfortunately been retarded in the churchyard by a fight between children\r\nand dogs--a common incident in the streets in those days. “_Dogs and\r\nboys_,” say the old registers of police, placing the dogs before the\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nA man being taken before a magistrate by the police was, after all, an\r\neveryday affair, and each one having his own business to attend to, the\r\nfew who had followed soon dispersed. There remained but Ursus on the\r\ntrack of Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nThey passed before two chapels opposite to each other, belonging the one\r\nto the Recreative Religionists, the other to the Hallelujah\r\nLeague--sects which flourished then, and which exist to the present day.\r\n\r\nThen the _cortège_ wound from street to street, making a zigzag,\r\nchoosing by preference lanes not yet built on, roads where the grass\r\ngrew, and deserted alleys.\r\n\r\nAt length it stopped.\r\n\r\nIt was in a little lane with no houses except two or three hovels. This\r\nnarrow alley was composed of two walls--one on the left, low; the other\r\non the right, high. The high wall was black, and built in the Saxon\r\nstyle with narrow holes, scorpions, and large square gratings over\r\nnarrow loopholes. There was no window on it, but here and there slits,\r\nold embrasures of _pierriers_ and archegayes. At the foot of this high\r\nwall was seen, like the hole at the bottom of a rat-trap, a little\r\nwicket gate, very elliptical in its arch.\r\n\r\nThis small door, encased in a full, heavy girding of stone, had a grated\r\npeephole, a heavy knocker, a large lock, hinges thick and knotted, a\r\nbristling of nails, an armour of plates, and hinges, so that altogether\r\nit was more of iron than of wood.\r\n\r\nThere was no one in the lane--no shops, no passengers; but in it there\r\nwas heard a continual noise, as if the lane ran parallel to a torrent.\r\nThere was a tumult of voices and of carriages. It seemed as if on the\r\nother side of the black edifice there must be a great street, doubtless\r\nthe principal street of Southwark, one end of which ran into the\r\nCanterbury road, and the other on to London Bridge.\r\n\r\nAll the length of the lane, except the _cortège_ which surrounded\r\nGwynplaine, a watcher would have seen no other human face than the pale\r\nprofile of Ursus, hazarding a hall advance from the shadow of the corner\r\nof the wall--looking, yet fearing to see. He had posted himself behind\r\nthe wall at a turn of the lane.\r\n\r\nThe constables grouped themselves before the wicket. Gwynplaine was in\r\nthe centre, the wapentake and his baton of iron being now behind him.\r\n\r\nThe justice of the quorum raised the knocker, and struck the door three\r\ntimes. The loophole opened.\r\n\r\nThe justice of the quorum said,--\r\n\r\n“By order of her Majesty.”\r\n\r\nThe heavy door of oak and iron turned on its hinges, making a chilly\r\nopening, like the mouth of a cavern. A hideous depth yawned in the\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\nUrsus saw Gwynplaine disappear within it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nA FEARFUL PLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wapentake entered behind Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nThen the justice of the quorum.\r\n\r\nThen the constables.\r\n\r\nThe wicket was closed.\r\n\r\nThe heavy door swung to, closing hermetically on the stone sills,\r\nwithout any one seeing who had opened or shut it. It seemed as if the\r\nbolts re-entered their sockets of their own act. Some of these\r\nmechanisms, the inventions of ancient intimidation, still exist in old\r\nprisons--doors of which you saw no doorkeeper. With them the entrance to\r\na prison becomes like the entrance to a tomb.\r\n\r\nThis wicket was the lower door of Southwark Jail.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in the harsh and worm-eaten aspect of this prison to\r\nsoften its appropriate air of rigour.\r\n\r\nOriginally a pagan temple, built by the Catieuchlans for the Mogons,\r\nancient English gods, it became a palace for Ethelwolf and a fortress\r\nfor Edward the Confessor; then it was elevated to the dignity of a\r\nprison, in 1199, by John Lackland. Such was Southwark Jail. This jail,\r\nat first intersected by a street, like Chenonceaux by a river, had been\r\nfor a century or two a gate--that is to say, the gate of the suburb; the\r\npassage had then been walled up. There remain in England some prisons\r\nof this nature. In London, Newgate; at Canterbury, Westgate; at\r\nEdinburgh, Canongate. In France the Bastile was originally a gate.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the jails of England present the same appearance--a high wall\r\nwithout and a hive of cells within. Nothing could be more funereal than\r\nthe appearance of those prisons, where spiders and justice spread their\r\nwebs, and where John Howard, that ray of light, had not yet penetrated.\r\nLike the old Gehenna of Brussels, they might well have been designated\r\nTreurenberg--_the house of tears_.\r\n\r\nMen felt before such buildings, at once so savage and inhospitable, the\r\nsame distress that the ancient navigators suffered before the hell of\r\nslaves mentioned by Plautus, islands of creaking chains,\r\n_ferricrepiditæ insulæ_, when they passed near enough to hear the\r\nclank of the fetters.\r\n\r\nSouthwark Jail, an old place of exorcisms and torture, was originally\r\nused solely for the imprisonment of sorcerers, as was proved by two\r\nverses engraved on a defaced stone at the foot of the wicket,--\r\n\r\n  Sunt arreptitii, vexati dæmone multo\r\n  Est energumenus, quem dæmon possidet unus.\r\n\r\nLines which draw a subtle delicate distinction between the demoniac and\r\nman possessed by a devil.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of this inscription, nailed flat against the wall, was a\r\nstone ladder, which had been originally of wood, but which had been\r\nchanged into stone by being buried in earth of petrifying quality at a\r\nplace called Apsley Gowis, near Woburn Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe prison of Southwark, now demolished, opened on two streets, between\r\nwhich, as a gate, it formerly served as means of communication. It had\r\ntwo doors. In the large street a door, apparently used by the\r\nauthorities; and in the lane the door of punishment, used by the rest of\r\nthe living and by the dead also, because when a prisoner in the jail\r\ndied it was by that issue that his corpse was carried out. A liberation\r\nnot to be despised. Death is release into infinity.\r\n\r\nIt was by the gate of punishment that Gwynplaine had been taken into\r\nprison. The lane, as we have said, was nothing but a little passage,\r\npaved with flints, confined between two opposite walls. There is one of\r\nthe same kind at Brussels called _Rue d’une Personne_. The walls were\r\nunequal in height. The high one was the prison; the low one, the\r\ncemetery--the enclosure for the mortuary remains of the jail--was not\r\nhigher than the ordinary stature of a man. In it was a gate almost\r\nopposite the prison wicket. The dead had only to cross the street; the\r\ncemetery was but twenty paces from the jail. On the high wall was\r\naffixed a gallows; on the low one was sculptured a Death’s head. Neither\r\nof these walls made its opposite neighbour more cheerful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE KIND OF MAGISTRACY UNDER THE WIGS OF FORMER DAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny one observing at that moment the other side of the prison--its\r\nfaçade--would have perceived the high street of Southwark, and might\r\nhave remarked, stationed before the monumental and official entrance to\r\nthe jail, a travelling carriage, recognized as such by its imperial. A\r\nfew idlers surrounded the carriage. On it was a coat of arms, and a\r\npersonage had been seen to descend from it and enter the prison.\r\n“Probably a magistrate,” conjectured the crowd. Many of the English\r\nmagistrates were noble, and almost all had the right of bearing arms. In\r\nFrance blazon and robe were almost contradictory terms. The Duke\r\nSaint-Simon says, in speaking of magistrates, “people of that class.” In\r\nEngland a gentleman was not despised for being a judge.\r\n\r\nThere are travelling magistrates in England; they are called judges of\r\ncircuit, and nothing was easier than to recognize the carriage as the\r\nvehicle of a judge on circuit. That which was less comprehensible was,\r\nthat the supposed magistrate got down, not from the carriage itself, but\r\nfrom the box, a place which is not habitually occupied by the owner.\r\nAnother unusual thing. People travelled at that period in England in two\r\nways--by coach, at the rate of a shilling for five miles; and by post,\r\npaying three half-pence per mile, and twopence to the postillion after\r\neach stage. A private carriage, whose owner desired to travel by relays,\r\npaid as many shillings per horse per mile as the horseman paid pence.\r\nThe carriage drawn up before the jail in Southwark had four horses and\r\ntwo postillions, which displayed princely state. Finally, that which\r\nexcited and disconcerted conjectures to the utmost was the circumstance\r\nthat the carriage was sedulously shut up. The blinds of the windows\r\nwere closed up. The glasses in front were darkened by blinds; every\r\nopening by which the eye might have penetrated was masked. From without,\r\nnothing within could be seen, and most likely from within, nothing could\r\nbe seen outside. However, it did not seem probable that there was any\r\none in the carriage.\r\n\r\nSouthwark being in Surrey, the prison was within the jurisdiction of the\r\nsheriff of the county.\r\n\r\nSuch distinct jurisdictions were very frequent in England. Thus, for\r\nexample, the Tower of London was not supposed to be situated in any\r\ncounty; that is to say, that legally it was considered to be in air. The\r\nTower recognized no authority of jurisdiction except in its own\r\nconstable, who was qualified as _custos turris_. The Tower had its\r\njurisdiction, its church, its court of justice, and its government\r\napart. The authority of its _custos_, or constable, extended, beyond\r\nLondon, over twenty-one hamlets. As in Great Britain legal singularities\r\nengraft one upon another the office of the master gunner of England was\r\nderived from the Tower of London. Other legal customs seem still more\r\nwhimsical. Thus, the English Court of Admiralty consults and applies the\r\nlaws of Rhodes and of Oleron, a French island which was once English.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff of a county was a person of high consideration. He was\r\nalways an esquire, and sometimes a knight. He was called _spectabilis_\r\nin the old deeds, “a man to be looked at”--kind of intermediate title\r\nbetween _illustris_ and _clarissimus_; less than the first, more than\r\nthe second. Long ago the sheriffs of the counties were chosen by the\r\npeople; but Edward II., and after him Henry VI., having claimed their\r\nnomination for the crown, the office of sheriff became a royal\r\nemanation.\r\n\r\nThey all received their commissions from majesty, except the sheriff of\r\nWestmoreland, whose office was hereditary, and the sheriffs of London\r\nand Middlesex, who were elected by the livery in the common hall.\r\nSheriffs of Wales and Chester possessed certain fiscal prerogatives.\r\nThese appointments are all still in existence in England, but, subjected\r\nlittle by little to the friction of manners and ideas, they have lost\r\ntheir old aspects. It was the duty of the sheriff of the county to\r\nescort and protect the judges on circuit. As we have two arms, he had\r\ntwo officers; his right arm the under-sheriff, his left arm the justice\r\nof the quorum. The justice of the quorum, assisted by the bailiff of the\r\nhundred, termed the wapentake, apprehended, examined, and, under the\r\nresponsibility of the sheriff, imprisoned, for trial by the judges of\r\ncircuit, thieves, murderers, rebels, vagabonds, and all sorts of felons.\r\n\r\nThe shade of difference between the under-sheriff and the justice of the\r\nquorum, in their hierarchical service towards the sheriff, was that the\r\nunder-sheriff accompanied and the justice of the quorum assisted.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff held two courts--one fixed and central, the county court;\r\nand a movable court, the sheriff’s turn. He thus represented both unity\r\nand ubiquity. He might as judge be aided and informed on legal questions\r\nby the serjeant of the coif, called _sergens coifæ_, who is a\r\nserjeant-at-law, and who wears under his black skull-cap a fillet of\r\nwhite Cambray lawn.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff delivered the jails. When he arrived at a town in his\r\nprovince, he had the right of summary trial of the prisoners, of which\r\nhe might cause either their release or the execution. This was called a\r\njail delivery. The sheriff presented bills of indictment to the\r\ntwenty-four members of the grand jury. If they approved, they wrote\r\nabove, _billa vera_; if the contrary, they wrote _ignoramus_. In the\r\nlatter case the accusation was annulled, and the sheriff had the\r\nprivilege of tearing up the bill. If during the deliberation a juror\r\ndied, this legally acquitted the prisoner and made him innocent, and the\r\nsheriff, who had the privilege of arresting the accused, had also that\r\nof setting him at liberty.\r\n\r\nThat which made the sheriff singularly feared and respected was that he\r\nhad the charge of executing all the orders of her Majesty--a fearful\r\nlatitude. An arbitrary power lodges in such commissions.\r\n\r\nThe officers termed vergers, the coroners making part of the sheriff’s\r\n_cortège_, and the clerks of the market as escort, with gentlemen on\r\nhorseback and their servants in livery, made a handsome suite. The\r\nsheriff, says Chamberlayne, is the “life of justice, of law, and of the\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nIn England an insensible demolition constantly pulverizes and dissevers\r\nlaws and customs. You must understand in our day that neither the\r\nsheriff, the wapentake, nor the justice of the quorum could exercise\r\ntheir functions as they did then. There was in the England of the past a\r\ncertain confusion of powers, whose ill-defined attributes resulted in\r\ntheir overstepping their real bounds at times--a thing which would be\r\nimpossible in the present day. The usurpation of power by police and\r\njustices has ceased. We believe that even the word “wapentake” has\r\nchanged its meaning. It implied a magisterial function; now it signifies\r\na territorial division: it specified the centurion; it now specifies the\r\nhundred (_centum_).\r\n\r\nMoreover, in those days the sheriff of the county combined with\r\nsomething more and something less, and condensed in his own authority,\r\nwhich was at once royal and municipal, the two magistrates formerly\r\ncalled in France the civil lieutenant of Paris and the lieutenant of\r\npolice. The civil lieutenant of Paris, Monsieur, is pretty well\r\ndescribed in an old police note: “The civil lieutenant has no dislike to\r\ndomestic quarrels, because he always has the pickings” (22nd July 1704).\r\nAs to the lieutenant of police, he was a redoubtable person, multiple\r\nand vague. The best personification of him was René d’Argenson, who, as\r\nwas said by Saint-Simon, displayed in his face the three judges of hell\r\nunited.\r\n\r\nThe three judges of hell sat, as has already been seen, at Bishopsgate,\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSHUDDERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Gwynplaine heard the wicket shut, creaking in all its bolts, he\r\ntrembled. It seemed to him that the door which had just closed was the\r\ncommunication between light and darkness--opening on one side on the\r\nliving, human crowd, and on the other on a dead world; and now that\r\neverything illumined by the sun was behind him, that he had stepped over\r\nthe boundary of life and was standing without it, his heart contracted.\r\nWhat were they going to do with him? What did it all mean? Where was he?\r\n\r\nHe saw nothing around him; he found himself in perfect darkness. The\r\nshutting of the door had momentarily blinded him. The window in the door\r\nhad been closed as well. No loophole, no lamp. Such were the precautions\r\nof old times. It was forbidden to light the entrance to the jails, so\r\nthat the newcomers should take no observations.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine extended his arms, and touched the wall on the right side and\r\non the left. He was in a passage. Little by little a cavernous daylight\r\nexuding, no one knows whence, and which floats about dark places, and to\r\nwhich the dilatation of the pupil adjusts itself slowly, enabled him to\r\ndistinguish a feature here and there, and the corridor was vaguely\r\nsketched out before him.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, who had never had a glimpse of penal severities, save in the\r\nexaggerations of Ursus, felt as though seized by a sort of vague\r\ngigantic hand. To be caught in the mysterious toils of the law is\r\nfrightful. He who is brave in all other dangers is disconcerted in the\r\npresence of justice. Why? Is it that the justice of man works in\r\ntwilight, and the judge gropes his way? Gwynplaine remembered what Ursus\r\nhad told him of the necessity for silence. He wished to see Dea again;\r\nhe felt some discretionary instinct, which urged him not to irritate.\r\nSometimes to wish to be enlightened is to make matters worse; on the\r\nother hand, however, the weight of the adventure was so overwhelming\r\nthat he gave way at length, and could not restrain a question.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said he, “whither are you taking me?”\r\n\r\nThey made no answer.\r\n\r\nIt was the law of silent capture, and the Norman text is formal: _A\r\nsilentiariis ostio, præpositis introducti sunt_.\r\n\r\nThis silence froze Gwynplaine. Up to that moment he had believed himself\r\nto be firm: he was self-sufficing. To be self-sufficing is to be\r\npowerful. He had lived isolated from the world, and imagined that being\r\nalone he was unassailable; and now all at once he felt himself under the\r\npressure of a hideous collective force. How was he to combat that\r\nhorrible anonyma, the law? He felt faint under the perplexity; a fear of\r\nan unknown character had found a fissure in his armour; besides, he had\r\nnot slept, he had not eaten, he had scarcely moistened his lips with a\r\ncup of tea. The whole night had been passed in a kind of delirium, and\r\nthe fever was still on him. He was thirsty; perhaps hungry. The craving\r\nof the stomach disorders everything. Since the previous evening all\r\nkinds of incidents had assailed him. The emotions which had tormented\r\nhad sustained him. Without the storm a sail would be a rag. But his was\r\nthe excessive feebleness of the rag, which the wind inflates till it\r\ntears it. He felt himself sinking. Was he about to fall without\r\nconsciousness on the pavement? To faint is the resource of a woman, and\r\nthe humiliation of a man. He hardened himself, but he trembled. He felt\r\nas one losing his footing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nLAMENTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey began to move forward.\r\n\r\nThey advanced through the passage.\r\n\r\nThere was no preliminary registry, no place of record. The prisons in\r\nthose times were not overburdened with documents. They were content to\r\nclose round you without knowing why. To be a prison, and to hold\r\nprisoners, sufficed.\r\n\r\nThe procession was obliged to lengthen itself out, taking the form of\r\nthe corridor. They walked almost in single file; first the wapentake,\r\nthen Gwynplaine, then the justice of the quorum, then the constables,\r\nadvancing in a group, and blocking up the passage behind Gwynplaine as\r\nwith a bung. The passage narrowed. Now Gwynplaine touched the walls with\r\nboth his elbows. In the roof, which was made of flints, dashed with\r\ncement, was a succession of granite arches jutting out, and still more\r\ncontracting the passage. He had to stoop to pass under them. No speed\r\nwas possible in that corridor. Any one trying to escape through it would\r\nhave been compelled to move slowly. The passage twisted. All entrails\r\nare tortuous; those of a prison as well as those of a man. Here and\r\nthere, sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left, spaces in the\r\nwall, square and closed by large iron gratings, gave glimpses of flights\r\nof stairs, some descending and some ascending.\r\n\r\nThey reached a closed door; it opened. They passed through, and it\r\nclosed again. Then they came to a second door, which admitted them; then\r\nto a third, which also turned on its hinges. These doors seemed to open\r\nand shut of themselves. No one was to be seen. While the corridor\r\ncontracted, the roof grew lower, until at length it was impossible to\r\nstand upright. Moisture exuded from the wall. Drops of water fell from\r\nthe vault. The slabs that paved the corridor were clammy as an\r\nintestine. The diffused pallor that served as light became more and\r\nmore a pall. Air was deficient, and, what was singularly ominous, the\r\npassage was a descent.\r\n\r\nClose observation was necessary to perceive that there was such a\r\ndescent. In darkness a gentle declivity is portentous. Nothing is more\r\nfearful than the vague evils to which we are led by imperceptible\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nIt is awful to descend into unknown depths.\r\n\r\nHow long had they proceeded thus? Gwynplaine could not tell.\r\n\r\nMoments passed under such crushing agony seem immeasurably prolonged.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they halted.\r\n\r\nThe darkness was intense.\r\n\r\nThe corridor widened somewhat. Gwynplaine heard close to him a noise of\r\nwhich only a Chinese gong could give an idea; something like a blow\r\nstruck against the diaphragm of the abyss. It was the wapentake striking\r\nhis wand against a sheet of iron.\r\n\r\nThat sheet of iron was a door.\r\n\r\nNot a door on hinges, but a door which was raised and let down.\r\n\r\nSomething like a portcullis.\r\n\r\nThere was a sound of creaking in a groove, and Gwynplaine was suddenly\r\nface to face with a bit of square light. The sheet of metal had just\r\nbeen raised into a slit in the vault, like the door of a mouse-trap.\r\n\r\nAn opening had appeared.\r\n\r\nThe light was not daylight, but glimmer; but on the dilated eyeballs of\r\nGwynplaine the pale and sudden ray struck like a flash of lightning.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before he could see anything. To see with dazzled eyes\r\nis as difficult as to see in darkness.\r\n\r\nAt length, by degrees, the pupil of his eye became proportioned to the\r\nlight, just as it had been proportioned to the darkness, and he was able\r\nto distinguish objects. The light, which at first had seemed too bright,\r\nsettled into its proper hue and became livid. He cast a glance into the\r\nyawning space before him, and what he saw was terrible.\r\n\r\nAt his feet were about twenty steps, steep, narrow, worn, almost\r\nperpendicular, without balustrade on either side, a sort of stone ridge\r\ncut out from the side of a wall into stairs, entering and leading into\r\na very deep cell. They reached to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe cell was round, roofed by an ogee vault with a low arch, from the\r\nfault of level in the top stone of the frieze, a displacement common to\r\ncells under heavy edifices.\r\n\r\nThe kind of hole acting as a door, which the sheet of iron had just\r\nrevealed, and on which the stairs abutted, was formed in the vault, so\r\nthat the eye looked down from it as into a well.\r\n\r\nThe cell was large, and if it was the bottom of a well, it must have\r\nbeen a cyclopean one. The idea that the old word “_cul-de-basse-fosse_”\r\nawakens in the mind can only be applied to it if it were a lair of wild\r\nbeasts.\r\n\r\nThe cell was neither flagged nor paved. The bottom was of that cold,\r\nmoist earth peculiar to deep places.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the cell, four low and disproportioned columns sustained\r\na porch heavily ogival, of which the four mouldings united in the\r\ninterior of the porch, something like the inside of a mitre. This porch,\r\nsimilar to the pinnacles under which sarcophagi were formerly placed,\r\nrose nearly to the top of the vault, and made a sort of central chamber\r\nin the cavern, if that could be called a chamber which had only pillars\r\nin place of walls.\r\n\r\nFrom the key of the arch hung a brass lamp, round and barred like the\r\nwindow of a prison. This lamp threw around it--on the pillars, on the\r\nvault, on the circular wall which was seen dimly behind the pillars--a\r\nwan light, cut by bars of shadow.\r\n\r\nThis was the light which had at first dazzled Gwynplaine; now it threw\r\nout only a confused redness.\r\n\r\nThere was no other light in the cell--neither window, nor door, nor\r\nloophole.\r\n\r\nBetween the four pillars, exactly below the lamp, in the spot where\r\nthere was most light, a pale and terrible form lay on the ground.\r\n\r\nIt was lying on its back; a head was visible, of which the eyes were\r\nshut; a body, of which the chest was a shapeless mass; four limbs\r\nbelonging to the body, in the position of the cross of Saint Andrew,\r\nwere drawn towards the four pillars by four chains fastened to each foot\r\nand each hand.\r\n\r\nThese chains were fastened to an iron ring at the base of each column.\r\nThe form was held immovable, in the horrible position of being\r\nquartered, and had the icy look of a livid corpse.\r\n\r\nIt was naked. It was a man.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, as if petrified, stood at the top of the stairs, looking\r\ndown. Suddenly he heard a rattle in the throat.\r\n\r\nThe corpse was alive.\r\n\r\nClose to the spectre, in one of the ogives of the door, on each side of\r\na great seat, which stood on a large flat stone, stood two men swathed\r\nin long black cloaks; and on the seat an old man was sitting, dressed in\r\na red robe--wan, motionless, and ominous, holding a bunch of roses in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nThe bunch of roses would have enlightened any one less ignorant that\r\nGwynplaine. The right of judging with a nosegay in his hand implied the\r\nholder to be a magistrate, at once royal and municipal. The Lord Mayor\r\nof London still keeps up the custom. To assist the deliberations of the\r\njudges was the function of the earliest roses of the season.\r\n\r\nThe old man seated on the bench was the sheriff of the county of Surrey.\r\n\r\nHis was the majestic rigidity of a Roman dignitary.\r\n\r\nThe bench was the only seat in the cell.\r\n\r\nBy the side of it was a table covered with papers and books, on which\r\nlay the long, white wand of the sheriff. The men standing by the side of\r\nthe sheriff were two doctors, one of medicine, the other of law; the\r\nlatter recognizable by the Serjeant’s coif over his wig. Both wore black\r\nrobes--one of the shape worn by judges, the other by doctors.\r\n\r\nMen of these kinds wear mourning for the deaths of which they are the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nBehind the sheriff, at the edge of the flat stone under the seat, was\r\ncrouched--with a writing-table near to him, a bundle of papers on his\r\nknees, and a sheet of parchment on the bundle--a secretary, in a round\r\nwig, with a pen in his hand, in the attitude of a man ready to write.\r\n\r\nThis secretary was of the class called keeper of the bag, as was shown\r\nby a bag at his feet.\r\n\r\nThese bags, in former times employed in law processes, were termed bags\r\nof justice.\r\n\r\nWith folded arms, leaning against a pillar, was a man entirely dressed\r\nin leather, the hangman’s assistant.\r\n\r\nThese men seemed as if they had been fixed by enchantment in their\r\nfunereal postures round the chained man. None of them spoke or moved.\r\n\r\nThere brooded over all a fearful calm.\r\n\r\nWhat Gwynplaine saw was a torture chamber. There were many such in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe crypt of Beauchamp Tower long served this purpose, as did also the\r\ncell in the Lollards’ prison. A place of this nature is still to be seen\r\nin London, called “the Vaults of Lady Place.” In this last-mentioned\r\nchamber there is a grate for the purpose of heating the irons.\r\n\r\nAll the prisons of King John’s time (and Southwark Jail was one) had\r\ntheir chambers of torture.\r\n\r\nThe scene which is about to follow was in those days a frequent one in\r\nEngland, and might even, by criminal process, be carried out to-day,\r\nsince the same laws are still unrepealed. England offers the curious\r\nsight of a barbarous code living on the best terms with liberty. We\r\nconfess that they make an excellent family party.\r\n\r\nSome distrust, however, might not be undesirable. In the case of a\r\ncrisis, a return to the penal code would not be impossible. English\r\nlegislation is a tamed tiger with a velvet paw, but the claws are still\r\nthere. Cut the claws of the law, and you will do well. Law almost\r\nignores right. On one side is penalty, on the other humanity.\r\nPhilosophers protest; but it will take some time yet before the justice\r\nof man is assimilated to the justice of God.\r\n\r\nRespect for the law: that is the English phrase. In England they\r\nvenerate so many laws, that they never repeal any. They save themselves\r\nfrom the consequences of their veneration by never putting them into\r\nexecution. An old law falls into disuse like an old woman, and they\r\nnever think of killing either one or the other. They cease to make use\r\nof them; that is all. Both are at liberty to consider themselves still\r\nyoung and beautiful. They may fancy that they are as they were. This\r\npoliteness is called respect.\r\n\r\nNorman custom is very wrinkled. That does not prevent many an English\r\njudge casting sheep’s eyes at her. They stick amorously to an antiquated\r\natrocity, so long as it is Norman. What can be more savage than the\r\ngibbet? In 1867 a man was sentenced to be cut into four quarters and\r\noffered to a woman--the Queen.[18]\r\n\r\nStill, torture was never practised in England. History asserts this as\r\na fact. The assurance of history is wonderful.\r\n\r\nMatthew of Westminster mentions that the “Saxon law, very clement and\r\nkind,” did not punish criminals by death; and adds that “it limited\r\nitself to cutting off the nose and scooping out the eyes.” That was all!\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, scared and haggard, stood at the top of the steps, trembling\r\nin every limb. He shuddered from head to foot. He tried to remember what\r\ncrime he had committed. To the silence of the wapentake had succeeded\r\nthe vision of torture to be endured. It was a step, indeed, forward; but\r\na tragic one. He saw the dark enigma of the law under the power of which\r\nhe felt himself increasing in obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe human form lying on the earth rattled in its throat again.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine felt some one touching him gently on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nIt was the wapentake.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine knew that meant that he was to descend.\r\n\r\nHe obeyed.\r\n\r\nHe descended the stairs step by step. They were very narrow, each eight\r\nor nine inches in height. There was no hand-rail. The descent required\r\ncaution. Two steps behind Gwynplaine followed the wapentake, holding up\r\nhis iron weapon; and at the same interval behind the wapentake, the\r\njustice of the quorum.\r\n\r\nAs he descended the steps, Gwynplaine felt an indescribable extinction\r\nof hope. There was death in each step. In each one that he descended\r\nthere died a ray of the light within him. Growing paler and paler, he\r\nreached the bottom of the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe larva lying chained to the four pillars still rattled in its throat.\r\n\r\nA voice in the shadow said,--\r\n\r\n“Approach!”\r\n\r\nIt was the sheriff addressing Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine took a step forward.\r\n\r\n“Closer,” said the sheriff.\r\n\r\nThe justice of the quorum murmured in the ear of Gwynplaine, so gravely\r\nthat there was solemnity in the whisper, “You are before the sheriff of\r\nthe county of Surrey.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine advanced towards the victim extended in the centre of the\r\ncell. The wapentake and the justice of the quorum remained where they\r\nwere, allowing Gwynplaine to advance alone.\r\n\r\nWhen Gwynplaine reached the spot under the porch, close to that\r\nmiserable thing which he had hitherto perceived only from a distance,\r\nbut which was a living man, his fear rose to terror. The man who was\r\nchained there was quite naked, except for that rag so hideously modest,\r\nwhich might be called the vineleaf of punishment, the _succingulum_ of\r\nthe Romans, and the _christipannus_ of the Goths, of which the old\r\nGallic jargon made _cripagne_. Christ wore but that shred on the cross.\r\n\r\nThe terror-stricken sufferer whom Gwynplaine now saw seemed a man of\r\nabout fifty or sixty years of age. He was bald. Grizzly hairs of beard\r\nbristled on his chin. His eyes were closed, his mouth open. Every tooth\r\nwas to be seen. His thin and bony face was like a death’s-head. His arms\r\nand legs were fastened by chains to the four stone pillars in the shape\r\nof the letter X. He had on his breast and belly a plate of iron, and on\r\nthis iron five or six large stones were laid. His rattle was at times a\r\nsigh, at times a roar.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff, still holding his bunch of roses, took from the table with\r\nthe hand which was free his white wand, and standing up said, “Obedience\r\nto her Majesty.”\r\n\r\nThen he replaced the wand upon the table.\r\n\r\nThen in words long-drawn as a knell, without a gesture, and immovable as\r\nthe sufferer, the sheriff, raising his voice, said,--\r\n\r\n“Man, who liest here bound in chains, listen for the last time to the\r\nvoice of justice; you have been taken from your dungeon and brought to\r\nthis jail. Legally summoned in the usual forms, _formaliis verbis\r\npressus_; not regarding to lectures and communications which have been\r\nmade, and which will now be repeated, to you; inspired by a bad and\r\nperverse spirit of tenacity, you have preserved silence, and refused to\r\nanswer the judge. This is a detestable licence, which constitutes, among\r\ndeeds punishable by cashlit, the crime and misdemeanour of overseness.”\r\n\r\nThe serjeant of the coif on the right of the sheriff interrupted him,\r\nand said, with an indifference indescribably lugubrious in its effect,\r\n“_Overhernessa_. Laws of Alfred and of Godrun, chapter the sixth.”\r\n\r\nThe sheriff resumed.\r\n\r\n“The law is respected by all except by scoundrels who infest the woods\r\nwhere the hinds bear young.”\r\n\r\nLike one clock striking after another, the serjeant said,--\r\n\r\n“_Qui faciunt vastum in foresta ubi damoe solent founinare_.”\r\n\r\n“He who refuses to answer the magistrate,” said the sheriff, “is\r\nsuspected of every vice. He is reputed capable of every evil.”\r\n\r\nThe serjeant interposed.\r\n\r\n“_Prodigus, devorator, profusus, salax, ruffianus, ebriosus, luxuriosus,\r\nsimulator, consumptor patrimonii, elluo, ambro, et gluto_.”\r\n\r\n“Every vice,” said the sheriff, “means every crime. He who confesses\r\nnothing, confesses everything. He who holds his peace before the\r\nquestions of the judge is in fact a liar and a parricide.”\r\n\r\n“_Mendax et parricida_,” said the serjeant.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff said,--\r\n\r\n“Man, it is not permitted to absent oneself by silence. To pretend\r\ncontumaciousness is a wound given to the law. It is like Diomede\r\nwounding a goddess. Taciturnity before a judge is a form of rebellion.\r\nTreason to justice is high treason. Nothing is more hateful or rash. He\r\nwho resists interrogation steals truth. The law has provided for this.\r\nFor such cases, the English have always enjoyed the right of the foss,\r\nthe fork, and chains.”\r\n\r\n“_Anglica Charta_, year 1088,” said the serjeant. Then with the same\r\nmechanical gravity he added, “_Ferrum, et fossam, et furcas cum aliis\r\nlibertatibus_.”\r\n\r\nThe sheriff continued,--\r\n\r\n“Man! Forasmuch as you have not chosen to break silence, though of sound\r\nmind and having full knowledge in respect of the subject concerning\r\nwhich justice demands an answer, and forasmuch as you are diabolically\r\nrefractory, you have necessarily been put to torture, and you have been,\r\nby the terms of the criminal statutes, tried by the ‘_Peine forte et\r\ndure_.’ This is what has been done to you, for the law requires that I\r\nshould fully inform you. You have been brought to this dungeon. You have\r\nbeen stripped of your clothes. You have been laid on your back naked on\r\nthe ground, your limbs have been stretched and tied to the four pillars\r\nof the law; a sheet of iron has been placed on your chest, and as many\r\nstones as you can bear have been heaped on your belly, ‘and more,’ says\r\nthe law.”\r\n\r\n“_Plusque_,” affirmed the serjeant.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff continued,--\r\n\r\n“In this situation, and before prolonging the torture, a second summons\r\nto answer and to speak has been made you by me, sheriff of the county of\r\nSurrey, and you have satanically kept silent, though under torture,\r\nchains, shackles, fetters, and irons.”\r\n\r\n“_Attachiamenta legalia_,” said the serjeant.\r\n\r\n“On your refusal and contumacy,” said the sheriff, “it being right that\r\nthe obstinacy of the law should equal the obstinacy of the criminal, the\r\nproof has been continued according to the edicts and texts. The first\r\nday you were given nothing to eat or drink.”\r\n\r\n“_Hoc est superjejunare_,” said the serjeant.\r\n\r\nThere was silence, the awful hiss of the man’s breathing was heard from\r\nunder the heap of stones.\r\n\r\nThe serjeant-at-law completed his quotation.\r\n\r\n“_Adde augmentum abstinentiæ ciborum diminutione. Consuetudo\r\nbrittanica_, art. 504.”\r\n\r\nThe two men, the sheriff and the serjeant, alternated. Nothing could be\r\nmore dreary than their imperturbable monotony. The mournful voice\r\nresponded to the ominous voice; it might be said that the priest and the\r\ndeacon of punishment were celebrating the savage mass of the law.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff resumed,--\r\n\r\n“On the first day you were given nothing to eat or drink. On the second\r\nday you were given food, but nothing to drink. Between your teeth were\r\nthrust three mouthfuls of barley bread. On the third day they gave you\r\nto drink, but nothing to eat. They poured into your mouth at three\r\ndifferent times, and in three different glasses, a pint of water taken\r\nfrom the common sewer of the prison. The fourth day is come. It is\r\nto-day. Now, if you do not answer, you will be left here till you die.\r\nJustice wills it.”\r\n\r\nThe Serjeant, ready with his reply, appeared.\r\n\r\n“_Mors rei homagium est bonæ legi_.”\r\n\r\n“And while you feel yourself dying miserably,” resumed the sheriff, “no\r\none will attend to you, even when the blood rushes from your throat,\r\nyour chin, and your armpits, and every pore, from the mouth to the\r\nloins.”\r\n\r\n“_A throtabolla_,” said the Serjeant, “_et pabu et subhircis et a\r\ngrugno usque ad crupponum_.”\r\n\r\nThe sheriff continued,--\r\n\r\n“Man, attend to me, because the consequences concern you. If you\r\nrenounce your execrable silence, and if you confess, you will only be\r\nhanged, and you will have a right to the meldefeoh, which is a sum of\r\nmoney.”\r\n\r\n“_Damnum confitens_,” said the Serjeant, “_habeat le meldefeoh. Leges\r\nInæ_, chapter the twentieth.”\r\n\r\n“Which sum,” insisted the sheriff, “shall be paid in doitkins, suskins,\r\nand galihalpens, the only case in which this money is to pass, according\r\nto the terms of the statute of abolition, in the third of Henry V., and\r\nyou will have the right and enjoyment of _scortum ante mortem_, and then\r\nbe hanged on the gibbet. Such are the advantages of confession. Does it\r\nplease you to answer to justice?”\r\n\r\nThe sheriff ceased and waited.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner lay motionless.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff resumed,--\r\n\r\n“Man, silence is a refuge in which there is more risk than safety. The\r\nobstinate man is damnable and vicious. He who is silent before justice\r\nis a felon to the crown. Do not persist in this unfilial disobedience.\r\nThink of her Majesty. Do not oppose our gracious queen. When I speak to\r\nyou, answer her; be a loyal subject.”\r\n\r\nThe patient rattled in the throat.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff continued,--\r\n\r\n“So, after the seventy-two hours of the proof, here we are at the fourth\r\nday. Man, this is the decisive day. The fourth day has been fixed by the\r\nlaw for the confrontation.”\r\n\r\n“_Quarta die, frontem ad frontem adduce_,” growled the Serjeant.\r\n\r\n“The wisdom of the law,” continued the sheriff, “has chosen this last\r\nhour to hold what our ancestors called ‘judgment by mortal cold,’ seeing\r\nthat it is the moment when men are believed on their yes or their no.”\r\n\r\nThe serjeant on the right confirmed his words.\r\n\r\n“_Judicium pro frodmortell, quod homines credendi sint per suum ya et\r\nper suum no_. Charter of King Adelstan, volume the first, page one\r\nhundred and sixty-three.”\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s pause; then the sheriff bent his stern face towards\r\nthe prisoner.\r\n\r\n“Man, who art lying there on the ground--”\r\n\r\nHe paused.\r\n\r\n“Man,” he cried, “do you hear me?”\r\n\r\nThe man did not move.\r\n\r\n“In the name of the law,” said the sheriff, “open your eyes.”\r\n\r\nThe man’s lids remained closed.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff turned to the doctor, who was standing on his left.\r\n\r\n“Doctor, give your diagnostic.”\r\n\r\n“_Probe, da diagnosticum_,” said the serjeant.\r\n\r\nThe doctor came down with magisterial stiffness, approached the man,\r\nleant over him, put his ear close to the mouth of the sufferer, felt the\r\npulse at the wrist, the armpit, and the thigh, then rose again.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said the sheriff.\r\n\r\n“He can still hear,” said the doctor.\r\n\r\n“Can he see?” inquired the sheriff.\r\n\r\nThe doctor answered, “He can see.”\r\n\r\nOn a sign from the sheriff, the justice of the quorum and the wapentake\r\nadvanced. The wapentake placed himself near the head of the patient. The\r\njustice of the quorum stood behind Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nThe doctor retired a step behind the pillars.\r\n\r\nThen the sheriff, raising the bunch of roses as a priest about to\r\nsprinkle holy water, called to the prisoner in a loud voice, and became\r\nawful.\r\n\r\n“O wretched man, speak! The law supplicates before she exterminates you.\r\nYou, who feign to be mute, remember how mute is the tomb. You, who\r\nappear deaf, remember that damnation is more deaf. Think of the death\r\nwhich is worse than your present state. Repent! You are about to be left\r\nalone in this cell. Listen! you who are my likeness; for I am a man!\r\nListen, my brother, because I am a Christian! Listen, my son, because I\r\nam an old man! Look at me; for I am the master of your sufferings, and I\r\nam about to become terrible. The terrors of the law make up the majesty\r\nof the judge. Believe that I myself tremble before myself. My own power\r\nalarms me. Do not drive me to extremities. I am filled by the holy\r\nmalice of chastisement. Feel, then, wretched man, the salutary and\r\nhonest fear of justice, and obey me. The hour of confrontation is come,\r\nand you must answer. Do not harden yourself in resistance. Do not that\r\nwhich will be irrevocable. Think that your end belongs to me. Half man,\r\nhalf corpse, listen! At least, let it not be your determination to\r\nexpire here, exhausted for hours, days, and weeks, by frightful agonies\r\nof hunger and foulness, under the weight of those stones, alone in this\r\ncell, deserted, forgotten, annihilated, left as food for the rats and\r\nthe weasels, gnawed by creatures of darkness while the world comes and\r\ngoes, buys and sells, whilst carriages roll in the streets above your\r\nhead. Unless you would continue to draw painful breath without remission\r\nin the depths of this despair--grinding your teeth, weeping,\r\nblaspheming--without a doctor to appease the anguish of your wounds,\r\nwithout a priest to offer a divine draught of water to your soul. Oh! if\r\nonly that you may not feel the frightful froth of the sepulchre ooze\r\nslowly from your lips, I adjure and conjure you to hear me. I call you\r\nto your own aid. Have pity on yourself. Do what is asked of you. Give\r\nway to justice. Open your eyes, and see if you recognize this man!”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner neither turned his head nor lifted his eyelids.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff cast a glance first at the justice of the quorum and then at\r\nthe wapentake.\r\n\r\nThe justice of the quorum, taking Gwynplaine’s hat and mantle, put his\r\nhands on his shoulders and placed him in the light by the side of the\r\nchained man. The face of Gwynplaine stood out clearly from the\r\nsurrounding shadow in its strange relief.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the wapentake bent down, took the man’s temples\r\nbetween his hands, turned the inert head towards Gwynplaine, and with\r\nhis thumbs and his first fingers lifted the closed eyelids.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner saw Gwynplaine. Then, raising his head voluntarily, and\r\nopening his eyes wide, he looked at him.\r\n\r\nHe quivered as much as a man can quiver with a mountain on his breast,\r\nand then cried out,--\r\n\r\n“’Tis he! Yes; ’tis he!”\r\n\r\nAnd he burst into a horrible laugh.\r\n\r\n“’Tis he!” he repeated.\r\n\r\nThen his head fell back on the ground, and he closed his eyes again.\r\n\r\n“Registrar, take that down,” said the justice.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, though terrified, had, up to that moment, preserved a calm\r\nexterior. The cry of the prisoner, “’Tis he!” overwhelmed him\r\ncompletely. The words, “Registrar, take that down!” froze him. It seemed\r\nto him that a scoundrel had dragged him to his fate without his being\r\nable to guess why, and that the man’s unintelligible confession was\r\nclosing round him like the clasp of an iron collar. He fancied himself\r\nside by side with him in the posts of the same pillory. Gwynplaine lost\r\nhis footing in his terror, and protested. He began to stammer incoherent\r\nwords in the deep distress of an innocent man, and quivering, terrified,\r\nlost, uttered the first random outcries that rose to his mind, and words\r\nof agony like aimless projectiles.\r\n\r\n“It is not true. It was not me. I do not know the man. He cannot know\r\nme, since I do not know him. I have my part to play this evening. What\r\ndo you want of me? I demand my liberty. Nor is that all. Why have I been\r\nbrought into this dungeon? Are there laws no longer? You may as well say\r\nat once that there are no laws. My Lord Judge, I repeat that it is not\r\nI. I am innocent of all that can be said. I know I am. I wish to go\r\naway. This is not justice. There is nothing between this man and me. You\r\ncan find out. My life is not hidden up. They came and took me away like\r\na thief. Why did they come like that? How could I know the man? I am a\r\ntravelling mountebank, who plays farces at fairs and markets. I am the\r\nLaughing Man. Plenty of people have been to see me. We are staying in\r\nTarrinzeau Field. I have been earning an honest livelihood these fifteen\r\nyears. I am five-and-twenty. I lodge at the Tadcaster Inn. I am called\r\nGwynplaine. My lord, let me out. You should not take advantage of the\r\nlow estate of the unfortunate. Have compassion on a man who has done no\r\nharm, who is without protection and without defence. You have before you\r\na poor mountebank.”\r\n\r\n“I have before me,” said the sheriff, “Lord Fermain Clancharlie, Baron\r\nClancharlie and Hunkerville, Marquis of Corleone in Sicily, and a peer\r\nof England.”\r\n\r\nRising, and offering his chair to Gwynplaine, the sheriff added,--\r\n\r\n“My lord, will your lordship deign to seat yourself?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FIFTH.\r\n\r\n_THE SEA AND FATE ARE MOVED BY THE SAME BREATH._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE DURABILITY OF FRAGILE THINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDestiny sometimes proffers us a glass of madness to drink. A hand is\r\nthrust out of the mist, and suddenly hands us the mysterious cup in\r\nwhich is contained the latent intoxication.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine did not understand.\r\n\r\nHe looked behind him to see who it was who had been addressed.\r\n\r\nA sound may be too sharp to be perceptible to the ear; an emotion too\r\nacute conveys no meaning to the mind. There is a limit to comprehension\r\nas well as to hearing.\r\n\r\nThe wapentake and the justice of the quorum approached Gwynplaine and\r\ntook him by the arms. He felt himself placed in the chair which the\r\nsheriff had just vacated. He let it be done, without seeking an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nWhen Gwynplaine was seated, the justice of the quorum and the wapentake\r\nretired a few steps, and stood upright and motionless, behind the seat.\r\n\r\nThen the sheriff placed his bunch of roses on the stone table, put on\r\nspectacles which the secretary gave him, drew from the bundles of papers\r\nwhich covered the table a sheet of parchment, yellow, green, torn, and\r\njagged in places, which seemed to have been folded in very small folds,\r\nand of which one side was covered with writing; standing under the light\r\nof the lamp, he held the sheet close to his eyes, and in his most\r\nsolemn tone read as follows:--\r\n\r\n“In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\n“This present day, the twenty-ninth of January, one thousand six hundred\r\nand ninetieth year of our Lord.\r\n\r\n“Has been wickedly deserted on the desert coast of Portland, with the\r\nintention of allowing him to perish of hunger, of cold, and of solitude,\r\na child ten years old.\r\n\r\n“That child was sold at the age of two years, by order of his most\r\ngracious Majesty, King James the Second.\r\n\r\n“That child is Lord Fermain Clancharlie, the only legitimate son of Lord\r\nLinnæus Clancharlie, Baron Clancharlie and Hunkerville, Marquis of\r\nCorleone in Sicily, a peer of England, and of Ann Bradshaw, his wife,\r\nboth deceased. That child is the inheritor of the estates and titles of\r\nhis father. For this reason he was sold, mutilated, disfigured, and put\r\nout of the way by desire of his most gracious Majesty.\r\n\r\n“That child was brought up, and trained to be a mountebank at markets\r\nand fairs.\r\n\r\n“He was sold at the age of two, after the death of the peer, his father,\r\nand ten pounds sterling were given to the king as his purchase-money, as\r\nwell as for divers concessions, tolerations, and immunities.\r\n\r\n“Lord Fermain Clancharlie, at the age of two years, was bought by me,\r\nthe undersigned, who write these lines, and mutilated and disfigured by\r\na Fleming of Flanders, called Hardquanonne, who alone is acquainted with\r\nthe secrets and modes of treatment of Doctor Conquest.\r\n\r\n“The child was destined by us to be a laughing mask (_masca ridens_).\r\n\r\n“With this intention Hardquanonne performed on him the operation, _Bucca\r\nfissa usque ad aures_, which stamps an everlasting laugh upon the face.\r\n\r\n“The child, by means known only to Hardquanonne, was put to sleep and\r\nmade insensible during its performance, knowing nothing of the operation\r\nwhich he underwent.\r\n\r\n“He does not know that he is Lord Clancharlie.\r\n\r\n“He answers to the name of Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\n“This fact is the result of his youth, and the slight powers of memory\r\nhe could have had when he was bought and sold, being then barely two\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\n“Hardquanonne is the only person who knows how to perform the operation\r\n_Bucca fissa_, and the said child is the only living subject upon which\r\nit has been essayed.\r\n\r\n“The operation is so unique and singular that though after long years\r\nthis child should have come to be an old man instead of a child, and his\r\nblack locks should have turned white, he would be immediately recognized\r\nby Hardquanonne.\r\n\r\n“At the time that I am writing this, Hardquanonne, who has perfect\r\nknowledge of all the facts, and participated as principal therein, is\r\ndetained in the prisons of his highness the Prince of Orange, commonly\r\ncalled King William III. Hardquanonne was apprehended and seized as\r\nbeing one of the band of Comprachicos or Cheylas. He is imprisoned in\r\nthe dungeon of Chatham.\r\n\r\n“It was in Switzerland, near the Lake of Geneva, between Lausanne and\r\nVevey, in the very house in which his father and mother died, that the\r\nchild was, in obedience with the orders of the king, sold and given up\r\nby the last servant of the deceased Lord Linnæus, which servant died\r\nsoon after his master, so that this secret and delicate matter is now\r\nunknown to any one on earth, excepting Hardquanonne, who is in the\r\ndungeon of Chatham, and ourselves, now about to perish.\r\n\r\n“We, the undersigned, brought up and kept, for eight years, for\r\nprofessional purposes, the little lord bought by us of the king.\r\n\r\n“To-day, flying from England to avoid Hardquanonne’s ill-fortune, our\r\nfear of the penal indictments, prohibitions, and fulminations of\r\nParliament has induced us to desert, at night-fall, on the coast of\r\nPortland, the said child Gwynplaine, who is Lord Fermain Clancharlie.\r\n\r\n“Now, we have sworn secrecy to the king, but not to God.\r\n\r\n“To-night, at sea, overtaken by a violent tempest by the will of\r\nProvidence, full of despair and distress, kneeling before Him who could\r\nsave our lives, and may, perhaps, be willing to save our souls, having\r\nnothing more to hope from men, but everything to fear from God, having\r\nfor only anchor and resource repentance of our bad actions, resigned to\r\ndeath, and content if Divine justice be satisfied, humble, penitent, and\r\nbeating our breasts, we make this declaration, and confide and deliver\r\nit to the furious ocean to use as it best may according to the will of\r\nGod. And may the Holy Virgin aid us, Amen. And we attach our\r\nsignatures.”\r\n\r\nThe sheriff interrupted, saying,--“Here are the signatures. All in\r\ndifferent handwritings.”\r\n\r\nAnd he resumed,--\r\n\r\n“Doctor Gernardus Geestemunde.--Asuncion.--A cross, and at the side of\r\nit, Barbara Fermoy, from Tyrryf Isle, in the Hebrides; Gaizdorra,\r\nCaptain; Giangirate; Jacques Quartourze, alias le Narbonnais; Luc-Pierre\r\nCapgaroupe, from the galleys of Mahon.”\r\n\r\nThe sheriff, after a pause, resumed, a “note written in the same hand as\r\nthe text and the first signature,” and he read,--\r\n\r\n“Of the three men comprising the crew, the skipper having been swept off\r\nby a wave, there remain but two, and we have signed, Galdeazun; Ave\r\nMaria, Thief.”\r\n\r\nThe sheriff, interspersing his reading with his own observations,\r\ncontinued, “At the bottom of the sheet is written,--\r\n\r\n“‘At sea, on board of the _Matutina_, Biscay hooker, from the Gulf de\r\nPasages.’ This sheet,” added the sheriff, “is a legal document, bearing\r\nthe mark of King James the Second. On the margin of the declaration, and\r\nin the same handwriting there is this note, ‘The present declaration is\r\nwritten by us on the back of the royal order, which was given us as our\r\nreceipt when we bought the child. Turn the leaf and the order will be\r\nseen.’”\r\n\r\nThe sheriff turned the parchment, and raised it in his right hand, to\r\nexpose it to the light.\r\n\r\nA blank page was seen, if the word blank can be applied to a thing so\r\nmouldy, and in the middle of the page three words were written, two\r\nLatin words, _Jussu regis_, and a signature, _Jeffreys_.\r\n\r\n“_Jussu regis, Jeffreys_,” said the sheriff, passing from a grave voice\r\nto a clear one.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine was as a man on whose head a tile falls from the palace of\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nHe began to speak, like one who speaks unconsciously.\r\n\r\n“Gernardus, yes, the doctor. An old, sad-looking man. I was afraid of\r\nhim. Gaizdorra, Captain, that means chief. There were women, Asuncion,\r\nand the other. And then the Provençal. His name was Capgaroupe. He used\r\nto drink out of a flat bottle on which there was a name written in red.”\r\n\r\n“Behold it,” said the sheriff.\r\n\r\nHe placed on the table something which the secretary had just taken out\r\nof the bag. It was a gourd, with handles like ears, covered with wicker.\r\nThis bottle had evidently seen service, and had sojourned in the water.\r\nShells and seaweed adhered to it. It was encrusted and damascened over\r\nwith the rust of ocean. There was a ring of tar round its neck, showing\r\nthat it had been hermetically sealed. Now it was unsealed and open. They\r\nhad, however, replaced in the flask a sort of bung made of tarred oakum,\r\nwhich had been used to cork it.\r\n\r\n“It was in this bottle,” said the sheriff, “that the men about to perish\r\nplaced the declaration which I have just read. This message addressed to\r\njustice has been faithfully delivered by the sea.”\r\n\r\nThe sheriff increased the majesty of his tones, and continued,--\r\n\r\n“In the same way that Harrow Hill produces excellent wheat, which is\r\nturned into fine flour for the royal table, so the sea renders every\r\nservice in its power to England, and when a nobleman is lost finds and\r\nrestores him.”\r\n\r\nThen he resumed,--\r\n\r\n“On this flask, as you say, there is a name written in red.”\r\n\r\nHe raised his voice, turning to the motionless prisoner,--\r\n\r\n“Your name, malefactor, is here. Such are the hidden channels by which\r\ntruth, swallowed up in the gulf of human actions, floats to the\r\nsurface.”\r\n\r\nThe sheriff took the gourd, and turned to the light one of its sides,\r\nwhich had, no doubt, been cleaned for the ends of justice. Between the\r\ninterstices of wicker was a narrow line of red reed, blackened here and\r\nthere by the action of water and of time.\r\n\r\nThe reed, notwithstanding some breakages, traced distinctly in the\r\nwicker-work these twelve letters--Hardquanonne.\r\n\r\nThen the sheriff, resuming that monotonous tone of voice which resembles\r\nnothing else, and which may be termed a judicial accent, turned towards\r\nthe sufferer.\r\n\r\n“Hardquanonne! when by us, the sheriff, this bottle, on which is your\r\nname, was for the first time shown, exhibited, and presented to you, you\r\nat once, and willingly, recognized it as having belonged to you. Then,\r\nthe parchment being read to you which was contained, folded and enclosed\r\nwithin it, you would say no more; and in the hope, doubtless, that the\r\nlost child would never be recovered, and that you would escape\r\npunishment, you refuse to answer. As the result of your refusal, you\r\nhave had applied to you the _peine forte et dure_; and the second\r\nreading of the said parchment, on which is written the declaration and\r\nconfession of your accomplices, was made to you, but in vain.\r\n\r\n“This is the fourth day, and that which is legally set apart for the\r\nconfrontation, and he who was deserted on the twenty-ninth of January,\r\none thousand six hundred and ninety, having been brought into your\r\npresence, your devilish hope has vanished, you have broken silence, and\r\nrecognized your victim.”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner opened his eyes, lifted his head, and, with a voice\r\nstrangely resonant of agony, but which had still an indescribable calm\r\nmingled with its hoarseness, pronounced in excruciating accents, from\r\nunder the mass of stones, words to pronounce each of which he had to\r\nlift that which was like the slab of a tomb placed upon him. He spoke,--\r\n\r\n“I swore to keep the secret. I have kept it as long as I could. Men of\r\ndark lives are faithful, and hell has its honour. Now silence is\r\nuseless. So be it! For this reason I speak. Well--yes; ’tis he! We did\r\nit between us--the king and I: the king, by his will; I, by my art!”\r\n\r\nAnd looking at Gwynplaine,--\r\n\r\n“Now laugh for ever!”\r\n\r\nAnd he himself began to laugh.\r\n\r\nThis second laugh, wilder yet than the first, might have been taken for\r\na sob.\r\n\r\nThe laughed ceased, and the man lay back. His eyelids closed.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff, who had allowed the prisoner to speak, resumed,--\r\n\r\n“All which is placed on record.”\r\n\r\nHe gave the secretary time to write, and then said,--\r\n\r\n“Hardquanonne, by the terms of the law, after confrontation followed by\r\nidentification, after the third reading of the declarations of your\r\naccomplices, since confirmed by your recognition and confession, and\r\nafter your renewed avowal, you are about to be relieved from these\r\nirons, and placed at the good pleasure of her Majesty to be hung as\r\n_plagiary_.”\r\n\r\n“_Plagiary_,” said the serjeant of the coif. “That is to say, a buyer\r\nand seller of children. Law of the Visigoths, seventh book, third\r\nsection, paragraph _Usurpaverit_, and Salic law, section the\r\nforty-first, paragraph the second, and law of the Frisons, section the\r\ntwenty-first, _Deplagio_; and Alexander Nequam says,--\r\n\r\n“‘_Qui pueros vendis, plagiarius est tibi nomen_.’”\r\n\r\nThe sheriff placed the parchment on the table, laid down his spectacles,\r\ntook up the nosegay, and said,--\r\n\r\n“End of _la peine forte et dure_. Hardquanonne, thank her Majesty.”\r\n\r\nBy a sign the justice of the quorum set in motion the man dressed in\r\nleather.\r\n\r\nThis man, who was the executioner’s assistant, “groom of the gibbet,”\r\nthe old charters call him, went to the prisoner, took off the stones,\r\none by one, from his chest, and lifted the plate of iron up, exposing\r\nthe wretch’s crushed sides. Then he freed his wrists and ankle-bones\r\nfrom the four chains that fastened him to the pillars.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner, released alike from stones and chains, lay flat on the\r\nground, his eyes closed, his arms and legs apart, like a crucified man\r\ntaken down from a cross.\r\n\r\n“Hardquanonne,” said the sheriff, “arise!”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner did not move.\r\n\r\nThe groom of the gibbet took up a hand and let it go; the hand fell\r\nback. The other hand, being raised, fell back likewise.\r\n\r\nThe groom of the gibbet seized one foot and then the other, and the\r\nheels fell back on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe fingers remained inert, and the toes motionless. The naked feet of\r\nan extended corpse seem, as it were, to bristle.\r\n\r\nThe doctor approached, and drawing from the pocket of his robe a little\r\nmirror of steel, put it to the open mouth of Hardquanonne. Then with his\r\nfingers he opened the eyelids. They did not close again; the glassy\r\neyeballs remained fixed.\r\n\r\nThe doctor rose up and said,--\r\n\r\n“He is dead.”\r\n\r\nAnd he added,--\r\n\r\n“He laughed; that killed him.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis of little consequence,” said the sheriff. “After confession, life\r\nor death is a mere formality.”\r\n\r\nThen pointing to Hardquanonne by a gesture with the nosegay of roses,\r\nthe sheriff gave the order to the wapentake,--\r\n\r\n“A corpse to be carried away to-night.”\r\n\r\nThe wapentake acquiesced by a nod.\r\n\r\nAnd the sheriff added,--\r\n\r\n“The cemetery of the jail is opposite.”\r\n\r\nThe wapentake nodded again.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff, holding in his left hand the nosegay and in his right the\r\nwhite wand, placed himself opposite Gwynplaine, who was still seated,\r\nand made him a low bow; then assuming another solemn attitude, he turned\r\nhis head over his shoulder, and looking Gwynplaine in the face, said,--\r\n\r\n“To you here present, we Philip Denzill Parsons, knight, sheriff of the\r\ncounty of Surrey, assisted by Aubrey Dominick, Esq., our clerk and\r\nregistrar, and by our usual officers, duly provided by the direct and\r\nspecial commands of her Majesty, in virtue of our commission, and the\r\nrights and duties of our charge, and with authority from the Lord\r\nChancellor of England, the affidavits having been drawn up and recorded,\r\nregard being had to the documents communicated by the Admiralty, after\r\nverification of attestations and signatures, after declarations read and\r\nheard, after confrontation made, all the statements and legal\r\ninformation having been completed, exhausted, and brought to a good and\r\njust issue--we signify and declare to you, in order that right may be\r\ndone, that you are Fermain Clancharlie, Baron Clancharlie and\r\nHunkerville, Marquis de Corleone in Sicily, and a peer of England; and\r\nGod keep your lordship!”\r\n\r\nAnd he bowed to him.\r\n\r\nThe serjeant on the right, the doctor, the justice of the quorum, the\r\nwapentake, the secretary, all the attendants except the executioner,\r\nrepeated his salutation still more respectfully, and bowed to the ground\r\nbefore Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Gwynplaine, “awake me!”\r\n\r\nAnd he stood up, pale as death.\r\n\r\n“I come to awake you indeed,” said a voice which had not yet been heard.\r\n\r\nA man came out from behind the pillars. As no one had entered the cell\r\nsince the sheet of iron had given passage to the _cortège_ of police, it\r\nwas clear that this man had been there in the shadow before Gwynplaine\r\nhad entered, that he had a regular right of attendance, and had been\r\npresent by appointment and mission. The man was fat and pursy, and wore\r\na court wig and a travelling cloak.\r\n\r\nHe was rather old than young, and very precise.\r\n\r\nHe saluted Gwynplaine with ease and respect--with the ease of a\r\ngentleman-in-waiting, and without the awkwardness of a judge.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said; “I have come to awaken you. For twenty-five years you\r\nhave slept. You have been dreaming. It is time to awake. You believe\r\nyourself to be Gwynplaine; you are Clancharlie. You believe yourself to\r\nbe one of the people; you belong to the peerage. You believe yourself to\r\nbe of the lowest rank; you are of the highest. You believe yourself a\r\nplayer; you are a senator. You believe yourself poor; you are wealthy.\r\nYou believe yourself to be of no account; you are important. Awake, my\r\nlord!”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, in a low voice, in which a tremor of fear was to be\r\ndistinguished, murmured,--\r\n\r\n“What does it all mean?”\r\n\r\n“It means, my lord,” said the fat man, “that I am called Barkilphedro;\r\nthat I am an officer of the Admiralty; that this waif, the flask of\r\nHardquanonne, was found on the beach, and was brought to be unsealed by\r\nme, according to the duty and prerogative of my office; that I opened it\r\nin the presence of two sworn jurors of the Jetsam Office, both members\r\nof Parliament, William Brathwait, for the city of Bath, and Thomas\r\nJervois, for Southampton; that the two jurors deciphered and attested\r\nthe contents of the flask, and signed the necessary affidavit conjointly\r\nwith me; that I made my report to her Majesty, and by order of the queen\r\nall necessary and legal formalities were carried out with the discretion\r\nnecessary in a matter so delicate; that the last form, the\r\nconfrontation, has just been carried out; that you have £40,000 a year;\r\nthat you are a peer of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, a legislator\r\nand a judge, a supreme judge, a sovereign legislator, dressed in purple\r\nand ermine, equal to princes, like unto emperors; that you have on your\r\nbrow the coronet of a peer, and that you are about to wed a duchess, the\r\ndaughter of a king.”\r\n\r\nUnder this transfiguration, overwhelming him like a series of\r\nthunderbolts, Gwynplaine fainted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE WAIF KNOWS ITS OWN COURSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this had occurred owing to the circumstance of a soldier having\r\nfound a bottle on the beach. We will relate the facts. In all facts\r\nthere are wheels within wheels.\r\n\r\nOne day one of the four gunners composing the garrison of Castle Calshor\r\npicked up on the sand at low water a flask covered with wicker, which\r\nhad been cast up by the tide. This flask, covered with mould, was corked\r\nby a tarred bung. The soldier carried the waif to the colonel of the\r\ncastle, and the colonel sent it to the High Admiral of England. The\r\nAdmiral meant the Admiralty; with waifs, the Admiralty meant\r\nBarkilphedro.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro, having uncorked and emptied the bottle, carried it to the\r\nqueen. The queen immediately took the matter into consideration.\r\n\r\nTwo weighty counsellors were instructed and consulted--namely, the Lord\r\nChancellor, who is by law the guardian of the king’s conscience; and the\r\nLord Marshal, who is referee in Heraldry and in the pedigrees of the\r\nnobility. Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, a Catholic peer, who is\r\nhereditary Earl Marshal of England, had sent word by his deputy Earl\r\nMarshal, Henry Howard, Earl Bindon, that he would agree with the Lord\r\nChancellor. The Lord Chancellor was William Cowper. We must not confound\r\nthis chancellor with his namesake and contemporary William Cowper, the\r\nanatomist and commentator on Bidloo, who published a treatise on\r\nmuscles, in England, at the very time that Etienne Abeille published a\r\nhistory of bones, in France. A surgeon is a very different thing from a\r\nlord. Lord William Cowper is celebrated for having, with reference to\r\nthe affair of Talbot Yelverton, Viscount Longueville, propounded this\r\nopinion: That in the English constitution the restoration of a peer is\r\nmore important than the restoration of a king. The flask found at\r\nCalshor had awakened his interest in the highest degree. The author of a\r\nmaxim delights in opportunities to which it may be applied. Here was a\r\ncase of the restoration of a peer. Search was made. Gwynplaine, by the\r\ninscription over his door, was soon found. Neither was Hardquanonne\r\ndead. A prison rots a man, but preserves him--if to keep is to preserve.\r\nPeople placed in Bastiles were rarely removed. There is little more\r\nchange in the dungeon than in the tomb. Hardquanonne was still in prison\r\nat Chatham. They had only to put their hands on him. He was transferred\r\nfrom Chatham to London. In the meantime information was sought in\r\nSwitzerland. The facts were found to be correct. They obtained from the\r\nlocal archives at Vevey, at Lausanne, the certificate of Lord Linnæus’s\r\nmarriage in exile, the certificate of his child’s birth, the certificate\r\nof the decease of the father and mother; and they had duplicates, duly\r\nauthenticated, made to answer all necessary requirements.\r\n\r\nAll this was done with the most rigid secrecy, with what is called royal\r\npromptitude, and with that mole-like silence recommended and practised\r\nby Bacon, and later on made law by Blackstone, for affairs connected\r\nwith the Chancellorship and the state, and in matters termed\r\nparliamentary. The _jussu regis_ and the signature _Jeffreys_ were\r\nauthenticated. To those who have studied pathologically the cases of\r\ncaprice called “our good will and pleasure,” this _jussu regis_ is very\r\nsimple. Why should James II., whose credit required the concealment of\r\nsuch acts, have allowed that to be written which endangered their\r\nsuccess? The answer is, cynicism--haughty indifference. Oh! you believe\r\nthat effrontery is confined to abandoned women? The _raison d’état_ is\r\nequally abandoned. _Et se cupit ante videri_. To commit a crime and\r\nemblazon it, there is the sum total of history. The king tattooes\r\nhimself like the convict. Often when it would be to a man’s greatest\r\nadvantage to escape from the hands of the police or the records of\r\nhistory, he would seem to regret the escape so great is the love of\r\nnotoriety. Look at my arm! Observe the design! _I_ am Lacenaire! See, a\r\ntemple of love and a burning heart pierced through with an arrow! _Jussu\r\nregis_. It is I, James the Second. A man commits a bad action, and\r\nplaces his mark upon it. To fill up the measure of crime by effrontery,\r\nto denounce himself, to cling to his misdeeds, is the insolent bravado\r\nof the criminal. Christina seized Monaldeschi, had him confessed and\r\nassassinated, and said,--\r\n\r\n“I am the Queen of Sweden, in the palace of the King of France.”\r\n\r\nThere is the tyrant who conceals himself, like Tiberius; and the tyrant\r\nwho displays himself, like Philip II. One has the attributes of the\r\nscorpion, the other those rather of the leopard. James II. was of this\r\nlatter variety. He had, we know, a gay and open countenance, differing\r\nso far from Philip. Philip was sullen, James jovial. Both were equally\r\nferocious. James II. was an easy-minded tiger; like Philip II., his\r\ncrimes lay light upon his conscience. He was a monster by the grace of\r\nGod. Therefore he had nothing to dissimulate nor to extenuate, and his\r\nassassinations were by divine right. He, too, would not have minded\r\nleaving behind him those archives of Simancas, with all his misdeeds\r\ndated, classified, labelled, and put in order, each in its compartment,\r\nlike poisons in the cabinet of a chemist. To set the sign-manual to\r\ncrimes is right royal.\r\n\r\nEvery deed done is a draft drawn on the great invisible paymaster. A\r\nbill had just come due with the ominous endorsement, _Jussu regis_.\r\n\r\nQueen Anne, in one particular unfeminine, seeing that she could keep a\r\nsecret, demanded a confidential report of so grave a matter from the\r\nLord Chancellor--one of the kind specified as “report to the royal ear.”\r\nReports of this kind have been common in all monarchies. At Vienna there\r\nwas “a counsellor of the ear”--an aulic dignitary. It was an ancient\r\nCarlovingian office--the _auricularius_ of the old palatine deeds. He\r\nwho whispers to the emperor.\r\n\r\nWilliam, Baron Cowper, Chancellor of England, whom the queen believed in\r\nbecause he was short-sighted like herself, or even more so, had\r\ncommitted to writing a memorandum commencing thus: “Two birds were\r\nsubject to Solomon--a lapwing, the hudbud, who could speak all\r\nlanguages; and an eagle, the simourganka, who covered with the shadow of\r\nhis wings a caravan of twenty thousand men. Thus, under another form,\r\nProvidence,” etc. The Lord Chancellor proved the fact that the heir to a\r\npeerage had been carried off, mutilated, and then restored. He did not\r\nblame James II., who was, after all, the queen’s father. He even went so\r\nfar as to justify him. First, there are ancient monarchical maxims. _E\r\nsenioratu eripimus. In roturagio cadat_. Secondly, there is a royal\r\nright of mutilation. Chamberlayne asserts the fact.[19] _Corpora et bona\r\nnostrorum subjectorum nostra sunt_, said James I., of glorious and\r\nlearned memory. The eyes of dukes of the blood royal have been plucked\r\nout for the good of the kingdom. Certain princes, too near to the\r\nthrone, have been conveniently stifled between mattresses, the cause of\r\ndeath being given out as apoplexy. Now to stifle is worse than to\r\nmutilate. The King of Tunis tore out the eyes of his father, Muley\r\nAssem, and his ambassadors have not been the less favourably received by\r\nthe emperor. Hence the king may order the suppression of a limb like the\r\nsuppression of a state, etc. It is legal. But one law does not destroy\r\nanother. “If a drowned man is cast up by the water, and is not dead, it\r\nis an act of God readjusting one of the king. If the heir be found, let\r\nthe coronet be given back to him. Thus was it done for Lord Alla, King\r\nof Northumberland, who was also a mountebank. Thus should be done to\r\nGwynplaine, who is also a king, seeing that he is a peer. The lowness of\r\nthe occupation which he has been obliged to follow, under constraint of\r\nsuperior power, does not tarnish the blazon: as in the case of\r\nAbdolmumen, who was a king, although he had been a gardener; that of\r\nJoseph, who was a saint, although he had been a carpenter; that of\r\nApollo, who was a god, although he had been a shepherd.”\r\n\r\nIn short, the learned chancellor concluded by advising the\r\nreinstatement, in all his estates and dignities, of Lord Fermain\r\nClancharlie, miscalled Gwynplaine, on the sole condition that he should\r\nbe confronted with the criminal Hardquanonne, and identified by the\r\nsame. And on this point the chancellor, as constitutional keeper of the\r\nroyal conscience, based the royal decision. The Lord Chancellor added in\r\na postscript that if Hardquanonne refused to answer he should be\r\nsubjected to the _peine forte et dure_, until the period called the\r\n_frodmortell_, according to the statute of King Athelstane, which orders\r\nthe confrontation to take place on the fourth day. In this there is a\r\ncertain inconvenience, for if the prisoner dies on the second or third\r\nday the confrontation becomes difficult; still the law must be obeyed.\r\nThe inconvenience of the law makes part and parcel of it. In the mind of\r\nthe Lord Chancellor, however, the recognition of Gwynplaine by\r\nHardquanonne was indubitable.\r\n\r\nAnne, having been made aware of the deformity of Gwynplaine, and not\r\nwishing to wrong her sister, on whom had been bestowed the estates of\r\nClancharlie, graciously decided that the Duchess Josiana should be\r\nespoused by the new lord--that is to say, by Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nThe reinstatement of Lord Fermain Clancharlie was, moreover, a very\r\nsimple affair, the heir being legitimate, and in the direct line.\r\n\r\nIn cases of doubtful descent, and of peerages in abeyance claimed by\r\ncollaterals, the House of Lords must be consulted. This (to go no\r\nfurther back) was done in 1782, in the case of the barony of Sydney,\r\nclaimed by Elizabeth Perry; in 1798, in that of the barony of Beaumont,\r\nclaimed by Thomas Stapleton; in 1803, in that of the barony of\r\nStapleton; in 1803, in that of the barony of Chandos, claimed by the\r\nReverend Tymewell Brydges; in 1813, in that of the earldom of Banbury,\r\nclaimed by General Knollys, etc., etc. But the present was no similar\r\ncase. Here there was no pretence for litigation; the legitimacy was\r\nundoubted, the right clear and certain. There was no point to submit to\r\nthe House, and the Queen, assisted by the Lord Chancellor, had power to\r\nrecognize and admit the new peer.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro managed everything.\r\n\r\nThe affair, thanks to him, was kept so close, the secret was so\r\nhermetically sealed, that neither Josiana nor Lord David caught sight of\r\nthe fearful abyss which was being dug under them. It was easy to deceive\r\nJosiana, entrenched as she was behind a rampart of pride. She was\r\nself-isolated. As to Lord David, they sent him to sea, off the coast of\r\nFlanders. He was going to lose his peerage, and had no suspicion of it.\r\nOne circumstance is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nIt happened that at six leagues from the anchorage of the naval station\r\ncommanded by Lord David, a captain called Halyburton broke through the\r\nFrench fleet. The Earl of Pembroke, President of the Council, proposed\r\nthat this Captain Halyburton should be made vice-admiral. Anne struck\r\nout Halyburton’s name, and put Lord David Dirry-Moir’s in its place,\r\nthat he might, when no longer a peer, have the satisfaction of being a\r\nvice-admiral.\r\n\r\nAnne was well pleased. A hideous husband for her sister, and a fine step\r\nfor Lord David. Mischief and kindness combined.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty was going to enjoy a comedy. Besides, she argued to herself\r\nthat she was repairing an abuse of power committed by her august father.\r\nShe was reinstating a member of the peerage. She was acting like a\r\ngreat queen; she was protecting innocence according to the will of God\r\nthat Providence in its holy and impenetrable ways, etc., etc. It is very\r\nsweet to do a just action which is disagreeable to those whom we do not\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nTo know that the future husband of her sister was deformed, sufficed the\r\nqueen. In what manner Gwynplaine was deformed, and by what kind of\r\nugliness, Barkilphedro had not communicated to the queen, and Anne had\r\nnot deigned to inquire. She was proudly and royally disdainful. Besides,\r\nwhat could it matter? The House of Lords could not but be grateful. The\r\nLord Chancellor, its oracle, had approved. To restore a peer is to\r\nrestore the peerage. Royalty on this occasion had shown itself a good\r\nand scrupulous guardian of the privileges of the peerage. Whatever might\r\nbe the face of the new lord, a face cannot be urged in objection to a\r\nright. Anne said all this to herself, or something like it, and went\r\nstraight to her object, an object at once grand, womanlike, and\r\nregal--namely, to give herself a pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe queen was then at Windsor--a circumstance which placed a certain\r\ndistance between the intrigues of the court and the public. Only such\r\npersons as were absolutely necessary to the plan were in the secret of\r\nwhat was taking place. As to Barkilphedro, he was joyful--a circumstance\r\nwhich gave a lugubrious expression to his face. If there be one thing in\r\nthe world which can be more hideous than another, ’tis joy.\r\n\r\nHe had had the delight of being the first to taste the contents of\r\nHardquanonne’s flask. He seemed but little surprised, for astonishment\r\nis the attribute of a little mind. Besides, was it not all due to him,\r\nwho had waited so long on duty at the gate of chance? Knowing how to\r\nwait, he had fairly won his reward.\r\n\r\nThis _nil admirari_ was an expression of face. At heart we may admit\r\nthat he was very much astonished. Any one who could have lifted the mask\r\nwith which he covered his inmost heart even before God would have\r\ndiscovered this: that at the very time Barkilphedro had begun to feel\r\nfinally convinced that it would be impossible--even to him, the intimate\r\nand most infinitesimal enemy of Josiana--to find a vulnerable point in\r\nher lofty life. Hence an access of savage animosity lurked in his mind.\r\nHe had reached the paroxysm which is called discouragement. He was all\r\nthe more furious, because despairing. To gnaw one’s chain--how tragic\r\nand appropriate the expression! A villain gnawing at his own\r\npowerlessness!\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro was perhaps just on the point of renouncing not his desire\r\nto do evil to Josiana, but his hope of doing it; not the rage, but the\r\neffort. But how degrading to be thus baffled! To keep hate thenceforth\r\nin a case, like a dagger in a museum! How bitter the humiliation!\r\n\r\nAll at once to a certain goal--Chance, immense and universal, loves to\r\nbring such coincidences about--the flask of Hardquanonne came, driven\r\nfrom wave to wave, into Barkilphedro’s hands. There is in the unknown an\r\nindescribable fealty which seems to be at the beck and call of evil.\r\nBarkilphedro, assisted by two chance witnesses, disinterested jurors of\r\nthe Admiralty, uncorked the flask, found the parchment, unfolded, read\r\nit. What words could express his devilish delight!\r\n\r\nIt is strange to think that the sea, the wind, space, the ebb and flow\r\nof the tide, storms, calms, breezes, should have given themselves so\r\nmuch trouble to bestow happiness on a scoundrel. That co-operation had\r\ncontinued for fifteen years. Mysterious efforts! During fifteen years\r\nthe ocean had never for an instant ceased from its labours. The waves\r\ntransmitted from one to another the floating bottle. The shelving rocks\r\nhad shunned the brittle glass; no crack had yawned in the flask; no\r\nfriction had displaced the cork; the sea-weeds had not rotted the osier;\r\nthe shells had not eaten out the word “Hardquanonne;” the water had not\r\npenetrated into the waif; the mould had not rotted the parchment; the\r\nwet had hot effaced the writing. What trouble the abyss must have taken!\r\nThus that which Gernardus had flung into darkness, darkness had handed\r\nback to Barkilphedro. The message sent to God had reached the devil.\r\nSpace had committed an abuse of confidence, and a lurking sarcasm which\r\nmingles with events had so arranged that it had complicated the loyal\r\ntriumph of the lost child’s becoming Lord Clancharlie with a venomous\r\nvictory: in doing a good action, it had mischievously placed justice at\r\nthe service of iniquity. To save the victim of James II. was to give a\r\nprey to Barkilphedro. To reinstate Gwynplaine was to crush Josiana.\r\nBarkilphedro had succeeded, and it was for this that for so many years\r\nthe waves, the surge, the squalls had buffeted, shaken, thrown, pushed,\r\ntormented, and respected this bubble of glass, which bore within it so\r\nmany commingled fates. It was for this that there had been a cordial\r\nco-operation between the winds, the tides, and the tempests--a vast\r\nagitation of all prodigies for the pleasure of a scoundrel; the infinite\r\nco-operating with an earthworm! Destiny is subject to such grim\r\ncaprices.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro was struck by a flash of Titanic pride. He said to himself\r\nthat it had all been done to fulfil his intentions. He felt that he was\r\nthe object and the instrument.\r\n\r\nBut he was wrong. Let us clear the character of chance.\r\n\r\nSuch was not the real meaning of the remarkable circumstance of which\r\nthe hatred of Barkilphedro was to profit. Ocean had made itself father\r\nand mother to an orphan, had sent the hurricane against his\r\nexecutioners, had wrecked the vessel which had repulsed the child, had\r\nswallowed up the clasped hands of the storm-beaten sailors, refusing\r\ntheir supplications and accepting only their repentance; the tempest\r\nreceived a deposit from the hands of death. The strong vessel containing\r\nthe crime was replaced by the fragile phial containing the reparation.\r\nThe sea changed its character, and, like a panther turning nurse, began\r\nto rock the cradle, not of the child, but of his destiny, whilst he grew\r\nup ignorant of all that the depths of ocean were doing for him.\r\n\r\nThe waves to which this flask had been flung watching over that past\r\nwhich contained a future; the whirlwind breathing kindly on it; the\r\ncurrents directing the frail waif across the fathomless wastes of water;\r\nthe caution exercised by seaweed, the swells, the rocks; the vast froth\r\nof the abyss, taking under its protection an innocent child; the wave\r\nimperturbable as a conscience; chaos re-establishing order; the\r\nworldwide shadows ending in radiance; darkness employed to bring to\r\nlight the star of truth; the exile consoled in his tomb; the heir given\r\nback to his inheritance; the crime of the king repaired; divine\r\npremeditation obeyed; the little, the weak, the deserted child with\r\ninfinity for a guardian--all this Barkilphedro might have seen in the\r\nevent on which he triumphed. This is what he did not see. He did not\r\nbelieve that it had all been done for Gwynplaine. He fancied that it had\r\nbeen effected for Barkilphedro, and that he was well worth the trouble.\r\nThus it is ever with Satan.\r\n\r\nMoreover, ere we feel astonished that a waif so fragile should have\r\nfloated for fifteen years undamaged, we should seek to understand the\r\ntender care of the ocean. Fifteen years is nothing. On the 4th of\r\nOctober 1867, on the coast of Morbihan, between the Isle de Croix, the\r\nextremity of the peninsula de Gavres, and the Rocher des Errants, the\r\nfishermen of Port Louis found a Roman amphora of the fourth century,\r\ncovered with arabesques by the incrustations of the sea. That amphora\r\nhad been floating fifteen hundred years.\r\n\r\nWhatever appearance of indifference Barkilphedro tried to exhibit, his\r\nwonder had equalled his joy. Everything he could desire was there to his\r\nhand. All seemed ready made. The fragments of the event which was to\r\nsatisfy his hate were spread out within his reach. He had nothing to do\r\nbut to pick them up and fit them together--a repair which it was an\r\namusement to execute. He was the artificer.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine! He knew the name. _Masca ridens_. Like every one else, he\r\nhad been to see the Laughing Man. He had read the sign nailed up against\r\nthe Tadcaster Inn as one reads a play-bill that attracts a crowd. He had\r\nnoted it. He remembered it directly in its most minute details; and, in\r\nany case, it was easy to compare them with the original. That notice, in\r\nthe electrical summons which arose in his memory, appeared in the depths\r\nof his mind, and placed itself by the side of the parchment signed by\r\nthe shipwrecked crew, like an answer following a question, like the\r\nsolution following an enigma; and the lines--“Here is to be seen\r\nGwynplaine, deserted at the age of ten, on the 29th of January, 1690, on\r\nthe coast at Portland”--suddenly appeared to his eyes in the splendour\r\nof an apocalypse. His vision was the light of _Mene, Tekel, Upharsin_,\r\noutside a booth. Here was the destruction of the edifice which made the\r\nexistence of Josiana. A sudden earthquake. The lost child was found.\r\nThere was a Lord Clancharlie; David Dirry-Moir was nobody. Peerage,\r\nriches, power, rank--all these things left Lord David and entered\r\nGwynplaine. All the castles, parks, forests, town houses, palaces,\r\ndomains, Josiana included, belonged to Gwynplaine. And what a climax for\r\nJosiana! What had she now before her? Illustrious and haughty, a player;\r\nbeautiful, a monster. Who could have hoped for this? The truth was that\r\nthe joy of Barkilphedro had become enthusiastic. The most hateful\r\ncombinations are surpassed by the infernal munificence of the\r\nunforeseen. When reality likes, it works masterpieces. Barkilphedro\r\nfound that all his dreams had been nonsense; reality were better.\r\n\r\nThe change he was about to work would not have seemed less desirable had\r\nit been detrimental to him. Insects exist which are so savagely\r\ndisinterested that they sting, knowing that to sting is to die.\r\nBarkilphedro was like such vermin.\r\n\r\nBut this time he had not the merit of being disinterested. Lord David\r\nDirry-Moir owed him nothing, and Lord Fermain Clancharlie was about to\r\nowe him everything. From being a _protégé_ Barkilphedro was about to\r\nbecome a protector. Protector of whom? Of a peer of England. He was\r\ngoing to have a lord of his own, and a lord who would be his creature.\r\nBarkilphedro counted on giving him his first impressions. His peer would\r\nbe the morganatic brother-in-law of the queen. His ugliness would please\r\nthe queen in the same proportion as it displeased Josiana. Advancing by\r\nsuch favour, and assuming grave and modest airs, Barkilphedro might\r\nbecome a somebody. He had always been destined for the church. He had a\r\nvague longing to be a bishop.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he was happy.\r\n\r\nOh, what a great success! and what a deal of useful work had chance\r\naccomplished for him! His vengeance--for he called it his vengeance--had\r\nbeen softly brought to him by the waves. He had not lain in ambush in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nHe was the rock, Josiana was the waif. Josiana was about to be dashed\r\nagainst Barkilphedro, to his intense villainous ecstasy.\r\n\r\nHe was clever in the art of suggestion, which consists in making in the\r\nminds of others a little incision into which you put an idea of your\r\nown. Holding himself aloof, and without appearing to mix himself up in\r\nthe matter, it was he who arranged that Josiana should go to the Green\r\nBox and see Gwynplaine. It could do no harm. The appearance of the\r\nmountebank, in his low estate, would be a good ingredient in the\r\ncombination; later on it would season it.\r\n\r\nHe had quietly prepared everything beforehand. What he most desired was\r\nsomething unspeakably abrupt. The work on which he was engaged could\r\nonly be expressed in these strange words--the construction of a\r\nthunderbolt.\r\n\r\nAll preliminaries being complete, he had watched till all the necessary\r\nlegal formalities had been accomplished. The secret had not oozed out,\r\nsilence being an element of law.\r\n\r\nThe confrontation of Hardquanonne with Gwynplaine had taken place.\r\nBarkilphedro had been present. We have seen the result.\r\n\r\nThe same day a post-chaise belonging to the royal household was suddenly\r\nsent by her Majesty to fetch Lady Josiana from London to Windsor, where\r\nthe queen was at the time residing.\r\n\r\nJosiana, for reasons of her own, would have been very glad to disobey,\r\nor at least to delay obedience, and put off her departure till next day;\r\nbut court life does not permit of these objections. She was obliged to\r\nset out at once, and to leave her residence in London, Hunkerville\r\nHouse, for her residence at Windsor, Corleone Lodge.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess Josiana left London at the very moment that the wapentake\r\nappeared at the Tadcaster Inn to arrest Gwynplaine and take him to the\r\ntorture cell of Southwark.\r\n\r\nWhen she arrived at Windsor, the Usher of the Black Rod, who guards the\r\ndoor of the presence chamber, informed her that her Majesty was in\r\naudience with the Lord Chancellor, and could not receive her until the\r\nnext day; that, consequently, she was to remain at Corleone Lodge, at\r\nthe orders of her Majesty; and that she should receive the queen’s\r\ncommands direct, when her Majesty awoke the next morning. Josiana\r\nentered her house feeling very spiteful, supped in a bad humour, had the\r\nspleen, dismissed every one except her page, then dismissed him, and\r\nwent to bed while it was yet daylight.\r\n\r\nWhen she arrived she had learned that Lord David Dirry-Moir was expected\r\nat Windsor the next day, owing to his having, whilst at sea, received\r\norders to return immediately and receive her Majesty’s commands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nAN AWAKENING.\r\n\r\n\r\n     “No man could pass suddenly from Siberia into Senegal without\r\n     losing consciousness.”--HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\nThe swoon of a man, even of one the most firm and energetic, under the\r\nsudden shock of an unexpected stroke of good fortune, is nothing\r\nwonderful. A man is knocked down by the unforeseen blow, like an ox by\r\nthe poleaxe. Francis d’Albescola, he who tore from the Turkish ports\r\ntheir iron chains, remained a whole day without consciousness when they\r\nmade him pope. Now the stride from a cardinal to a pope is less than\r\nthat from a mountebank to a peer of England.\r\n\r\nNo shock is so violent as a loss of equilibrium.\r\n\r\nWhen Gwynplaine came to himself and opened his eyes it was night. He was\r\nin an armchair, in the midst of a large chamber lined throughout with\r\npurple velvet, over walls, ceiling, and floor. The carpet was velvet.\r\nStanding near him, with uncovered head, was the fat man in the\r\ntravelling cloak, who had emerged from behind the pillar in the cell at\r\nSouthwark. Gwynplaine was alone in the chamber with him. From the chair,\r\nby extending his arms, he could reach two tables, each bearing a branch\r\nof six lighted wax candles. On one of these tables there were papers and\r\na casket, on the other refreshments; a cold fowl, wine, and brandy,\r\nserved on a silver-gilt salver.\r\n\r\nThrough the panes of a high window, reaching from the ceiling to the\r\nfloor, a semicircle of pillars was to be seen, in the clear April night,\r\nencircling a courtyard with three gates, one very wide, and the other\r\ntwo low. The carriage gate, of great size, was in the middle; on the\r\nright, that for equestrians, smaller; on the left, that for foot\r\npassengers, still less. These gates were formed of iron railings, with\r\nglittering points. A tall piece of sculpture surmounted the central one.\r\nThe columns were probably in white marble, as well as the pavement of\r\nthe court, thus producing an effect like snow; and framed in its sheet\r\nof flat flags was a mosaic, the pattern of which was vaguely marked in\r\nthe shadow. This mosaic, when seen by daylight, would no doubt have\r\ndisclosed to the sight, with much emblazonry and many colours, a\r\ngigantic coat-of-arms, in the Florentine fashion. Zigzags of balustrades\r\nrose and fell, indicating stairs of terraces. Over the court frowned an\r\nimmense pile of architecture, now shadowy and vague in the starlight.\r\nIntervals of sky, full of stars, marked out clearly the outline of the\r\npalace. An enormous roof could be seen, with the gable ends vaulted;\r\ngarret windows, roofed over like visors; chimneys like towers; and\r\nentablatures covered with motionless gods and goddesses.\r\n\r\nBeyond the colonnade there played in the shadow one of those fairy\r\nfountains in which, as the water falls from basin to basin, it combines\r\nthe beauty of rain with that of the cascade, and as if scattering the\r\ncontents of a jewel box, flings to the wind its diamonds and its pearls\r\nas though to divert the statues around. Long rows of windows ranged\r\naway, separated by panoplies, in relievo, and by busts on small\r\npedestals. On the pinnacles, trophies and morions with plumes cut in\r\nstone alternated with statues of heathen deities.\r\n\r\nIn the chamber where Gwynplaine was, on the side opposite the window,\r\nwas a fireplace as high as the ceiling, and on another, under a dais,\r\none of those old spacious feudal beds which were reached by a ladder,\r\nand where you might sleep lying across; the joint-stool of the bed was\r\nat its side; a row of armchairs by the walls, and a row of ordinary\r\nchairs, in front of them, completed the furniture. The ceiling was\r\ndomed. A great wood fire in the French fashion blazed in the fireplace;\r\nby the richness of the flames, variegated of rose colour and green, a\r\njudge of such things would have seen that the wood was ash--a great\r\nluxury. The room was so large that the branches of candles failed to\r\nlight it up. Here and there curtains over doors, falling and swaying,\r\nindicated communications with other rooms. The style of the room was\r\naltogether that of the reign of James I.--a style square and massive,\r\nantiquated and magnificent. Like the carpet and the lining of the\r\nchamber, the dais, the baldaquin, the bed, the stool, the curtains, the\r\nmantelpiece, the coverings of the table, the sofas, the chairs, were all\r\nof purple velvet.\r\n\r\nThere was no gilding, except on the ceiling. Laid on it, at equal\r\ndistance from the four angles, was a huge round shield of embossed\r\nmetal, on which sparkled, in dazzling relief, various coats of arms.\r\nAmongst the devices, on two blazons, side by side, were to be\r\ndistinguished the cap of a baron and the coronet of a marquis. Were they\r\nof brass or of silver-gilt? You could not tell. They seemed to be of\r\ngold. And in the centre of this lordly ceiling, like a gloomy and\r\nmagnificent sky, the gleaming escutcheon was as the dark splendour of a\r\nsun shining in the night.\r\n\r\nThe savage, in whom is embodied the free man, is nearly as restless in a\r\npalace as in a prison. This magnificent chamber was depressing. So much\r\nsplendour produces fear. Who could be the inhabitant of this stately\r\npalace? To what colossus did all this grandeur appertain? Of what lion\r\nis this the lair? Gwynplaine, as yet but half awake, was heavy at\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n“Where am I?” he said.\r\n\r\nThe man who was standing before him answered,--“You are in your own\r\nhouse, my lord.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nFASCINATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt takes time to rise to the surface. And Gwynplaine had been thrown\r\ninto an abyss of stupefaction.\r\n\r\nWe do not gain our footing at once in unknown depths.\r\n\r\nThere are routs of ideas, as there are routs of armies. The rally is not\r\nimmediate.\r\n\r\nWe feel as it were scattered--as though some strange evaporation of self\r\nwere taking place.\r\n\r\nGod is the arm, chance is the sling, man is the pebble. How are you to\r\nresist, once flung?\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, if we may coin the expression, ricocheted from one surprise\r\nto another. After the love letter of the duchess came the revelation in\r\nthe Southwark dungeon.\r\n\r\nIn destiny, when wonders begin, prepare yourself for blow upon blow. The\r\ngloomy portals once open, prodigies pour in. A breach once made in the\r\nwall, and events rush upon us pell-mell. The marvellous never comes\r\nsingly.\r\n\r\nThe marvellous is an obscurity. The shadow of this obscurity was over\r\nGwynplaine. What was happening to him seemed unintelligible. He saw\r\neverything through the mist which a deep commotion leaves in the mind,\r\nlike the dust caused by a falling ruin. The shock had been from top to\r\nbottom. Nothing was clear to him. However, light always returns by\r\ndegrees. The dust settles. Moment by moment the density of astonishment\r\ndecreases. Gwynplaine was like a man with his eyes open and fixed in a\r\ndream, as if trying to see what may be within it. He dispersed the mist.\r\nThen he reshaped it. He had intermittances of wandering. He underwent\r\nthat oscillation of the mind in the unforeseen which alternately pushes\r\nus in the direction in which we understand, and then throws us back in\r\nthat which is incomprehensible. Who has not at some time felt this\r\npendulum in his brain?\r\n\r\nBy degrees his thoughts dilated in the darkness of the event, as the\r\npupil of his eye had done in the underground shadows at Southwark. The\r\ndifficulty was to succeed in putting a certain space between accumulated\r\nsensations. Before that combustion of hazy ideas called comprehension\r\ncan take place, air must be admitted between the emotions. There air was\r\nwanting. The event, so to speak, could not be breathed.\r\n\r\nIn entering that terrible cell at Southwark, Gwynplaine had expected the\r\niron collar of a felon; they had placed on his head the coronet of a\r\npeer. How could this be? There had not been space of time enough between\r\nwhat Gwynplaine had feared and what had really occurred; it had\r\nsucceeded too quickly--his terror changing into other feelings too\r\nabruptly for comprehension. The contrasts were too tightly packed one\r\nagainst the other. Gwynplaine made an effort to withdraw his mind from\r\nthe vice.\r\n\r\nHe was silent. This is the instinct of great stupefaction, which is more\r\non the defensive than it is thought to be. Who says nothing is prepared\r\nfor everything. A word of yours allowed to drop may be seized in some\r\nunknown system of wheels, and your utter destruction be compassed in its\r\ncomplex machinery.\r\n\r\nThe poor and weak live in terror of being crushed. The crowd ever expect\r\nto be trodden down. Gwynplaine had long been one of the crowd.\r\n\r\nA singular state of human uneasiness can be expressed by the words: Let\r\nus see what will happen. Gwynplaine was in this state. You feel that you\r\nhave not gained your equilibrium when an unexpected situation surges up\r\nunder your feet. You watch for something which must produce a result.\r\nYou are vaguely attentive. We will see what happens. What? You do not\r\nknow. Whom? You watch.\r\n\r\nThe man with the paunch repeated, “You are in your own house, my lord.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine felt himself. In surprises, we first look to make sure that\r\nthings exist; then we feel ourselves, to make sure that we exist\r\nourselves. It was certainly to him that the words were spoken; but he\r\nhimself was somebody else. He no longer had his jacket on, or his\r\nesclavine of leather. He had a waistcoat of cloth of silver; and a satin\r\ncoat, which he touched and found to be embroidered. He felt a heavy\r\npurse in his waistcoat pocket. A pair of velvet trunk hose covered his\r\nclown’s tights. He wore shoes with high red heels. As they had brought\r\nhim to this palace, so had they changed his dress.\r\n\r\nThe man resumed,--\r\n\r\n“Will your lordship deign to remember this: I am called Barkilphedro; I\r\nam clerk to the Admiralty. It was I who opened Hardquanonne’s flask and\r\ndrew your destiny out of it. Thus, in the ‘Arabian Nights’ a fisherman\r\nreleases a giant from a bottle.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine fixed his eyes on the smiling face of the speaker.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro continued:--\r\n\r\n“Besides this palace, my lord, Hunkerville House, which is larger, is\r\nyours. You own Clancharlie Castle, from which you take your title, and\r\nwhich was a fortress in the time of Edward the Elder. You have nineteen\r\nbailiwicks belonging to you, with their villages and their inhabitants.\r\nThis puts under your banner, as a landlord and a nobleman, about eighty\r\nthousand vassals and tenants. At Clancharlie you are a judge--judge of\r\nall, both of goods and of persons--and you hold your baron’s court. The\r\nking has no right which you have not, except the privilege of coining\r\nmoney. The king, designated by the Norman law as chief signor, has\r\njustice, court, and coin. Coin is money. So that you, excepting in this\r\nlast, are as much a king in your lordship as he is in his kingdom. You\r\nhave the right, as a baron, to a gibbet with four pillars in England;\r\nand, as a marquis, to a scaffold with seven posts in Sicily: that of the\r\nmere lord having two pillars; that of a lord of the manor, three; and\r\nthat of a duke, eight. You are styled prince in the ancient charters of\r\nNorthumberland. You are related to the Viscounts Valentia in Ireland,\r\nwhose name is Power; and to the Earls of Umfraville in Scotland, whose\r\nname is Angus. You are chief of a clan, like Campbell, Ardmannach, and\r\nMacallummore. You have eight barons’ courts--Reculver, Baston,\r\nHell-Kerters, Homble, Moricambe, Grundraith, Trenwardraith, and others.\r\nYou have a right over the turf-cutting of Pillinmore, and over the\r\nalabaster quarries near Trent. Moreover, you own all the country of\r\nPenneth Chase; and you have a mountain with an ancient town on it. The\r\ntown is called Vinecaunton; the mountain is called Moilenlli. All which\r\ngives you an income of forty thousand pounds a year. That is to say,\r\nforty times the five-and-twenty thousand francs with which a Frenchman\r\nis satisfied.”\r\n\r\nWhilst Barkilphedro spoke, Gwynplaine, in a crescendo of stupor,\r\nremembered the past. Memory is a gulf that a word can move to its lowest\r\ndepths. Gwynplaine knew all the words pronounced by Barkilphedro. They\r\nwere written in the last lines of the two scrolls which lined the van in\r\nwhich his childhood had been passed, and, from so often letting his eyes\r\nwander over them mechanically, he knew them by heart. On reaching, a\r\nforsaken orphan, the travelling caravan at Weymouth, he had found the\r\ninventory of the inheritance which awaited him; and in the morning, when\r\nthe poor little boy awoke, the first thing spelt by his careless and\r\nunconscious eyes was his own title and its possessions. It was a strange\r\ndetail added to all his other surprises, that, during fifteen years,\r\nrolling from highway to highway, the clown of a travelling theatre,\r\nearning his bread day by day, picking up farthings, and living on\r\ncrumbs, he should have travelled with the inventory of his fortune\r\nplacarded over his misery.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro touched the casket on the table with his forefinger.\r\n\r\n“My lord, this casket contains two thousand guineas which her gracious\r\nMajesty the Queen has sent you for your present wants.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine made a movement.\r\n\r\n“That shall be for my Father Ursus,” he said.\r\n\r\n“So be it, my lord,” said Barkilphedro. “Ursus, at the Tadcaster Inn.\r\nThe Serjeant of the Coif, who accompanied us hither, and is about to\r\nreturn immediately, will carry them to him. Perhaps I may go to London\r\nmyself. In that case I will take charge of it.”\r\n\r\n“I shall take them to him myself,” said Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro’s smile disappeared, and he said,--“Impossible!”\r\n\r\nThere is an impressive inflection of voice which, as it were, underlines\r\nthe words. Barkilphedro’s tone was thus emphasized; he paused, so as to\r\nput a full stop after the word he had just uttered. Then he continued,\r\nwith the peculiar and respectful tone of a servant who feels that he is\r\nmaster,--\r\n\r\n“My lord, you are twenty-three miles from London, at Corleone Lodge,\r\nyour court residence, contiguous to the Royal Castle of Windsor. You are\r\nhere unknown to any one. You were brought here in a close carriage,\r\nwhich was awaiting you at the gate of the jail at Southwark. The\r\nservants who introduced you into this palace are ignorant who you are;\r\nbut they know me, and that is sufficient. You may possibly have been\r\nbrought to these apartments by means of a private key which is in my\r\npossession. There are people in the house asleep, and it is not an hour\r\nto awaken them. Hence we have time for an explanation, which,\r\nnevertheless, will be short. I have been commissioned by her Majesty--”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Barkilphedro began to turn over the leaves of some bundles\r\nof papers which were lying near the casket.\r\n\r\n“My lord, here is your patent of peerage. Here is that of your Sicilian\r\nmarquisate. These are the parchments and title-deeds of your eight\r\nbaronies, with the seals of eleven kings, from Baldret, King of Kent, to\r\nJames the Sixth of Scotland, and first of England and Scotland united.\r\nHere are your letters of precedence. Here are your rent-rolls, and\r\ntitles and descriptions of your fiefs, freeholds, dependencies, lands,\r\nand domains. That which you see above your head in the emblazonment on\r\nthe ceiling are your two coronets: the circlet with pearls for the\r\nbaron, and the circlet with strawberry leaves for the marquis.\r\n\r\n“Here, in the wardrobe, is your peer’s robe of red velvet, bordered with\r\nermine. To-day, only a few hours since, the Lord Chancellor and the\r\nDeputy Earl Marshal of England, informed of the result of your\r\nconfrontation with the Comprachico Hardquanonne, have taken her\r\nMajesty’s commands. Her Majesty has signed them, according to her royal\r\nwill, which is the same as the law. All formalities have been complied\r\nwith. To-morrow, and no later than to-morrow, you will take your seat in\r\nthe House of Lords, where they have for some days been deliberating on a\r\nbill, presented by the crown, having for its object the augmentation, by\r\na hundred thousand pounds sterling yearly, of the annual allowance to\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland, husband of the queen. You will be able to take\r\npart in the debate.”\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro paused, breathed slowly, and resumed.\r\n\r\n“However, nothing is yet settled. A man cannot be made a peer of\r\nEngland without his own consent. All can be annulled and disappear,\r\nunless you acquiesce. An event nipped in the bud ere it ripens often\r\noccurs in state policy. My lord, up to this time silence has been\r\npreserved on what has occurred. The House of Lords will not be informed\r\nof the facts until to-morrow. Secrecy has been kept about the whole\r\nmatter for reasons of state, which are of such importance that the\r\ninfluential persons who alone are at this moment cognizant of your\r\nexistence, and of your rights, will forget them immediately should\r\nreasons of state command their being forgotten. That which is in\r\ndarkness may remain in darkness. It is easy to wipe you out; the more so\r\nas you have a brother, the natural son of your father and of a woman who\r\nafterwards, during the exile of your father, became mistress to King\r\nCharles II., which accounts for your brother’s high position at court;\r\nfor it is to this brother, bastard though he be, that your peerage would\r\nrevert. Do you wish this? I cannot think so. Well, all depends on you.\r\nThe queen must be obeyed. You will not quit the house till to-morrow in\r\na royal carriage, and to go to the House of Lords. My lord, will you be\r\na peer of England; yes or no? The queen has designs for you. She\r\ndestines you for an alliance almost royal. Lord Fermain Clancharlie,\r\nthis is the decisive moment. Destiny never opens one door without\r\nshutting another. After a certain step in advance, to step back is\r\nimpossible. Whoso enters into transfiguration, leaves behind him\r\nevanescence. My lord, Gwynplaine is dead. Do you understand?”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine trembled from head to foot.\r\n\r\nThen he recovered himself.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro, smiling, bowed, placed the casket under his cloak, and\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWE THINK WE REMEMBER; WE FORGET.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence arise those strange, visible changes which occur in the soul of\r\nman?\r\n\r\nGwynplaine had been at the same moment raised to a summit and cast into\r\nan abyss.\r\n\r\nHis head swam with double giddiness--the giddiness of ascent and\r\ndescent. A fatal combination.\r\n\r\nHe felt himself ascend, and felt not his fall.\r\n\r\nIt is appalling to see a new horizon.\r\n\r\nA perspective affords suggestions,--not always good ones.\r\n\r\nHe had before him the fairy glade, a snare perhaps, seen through opening\r\nclouds, and showing the blue depths of sky; so deep, that they are\r\nobscure.\r\n\r\nHe was on the mountain, whence he could see all the kingdoms of the\r\nearth. A mountain all the more terrible that it is a visionary one.\r\nThose who are on its apex are in a dream.\r\n\r\nPalaces, castles, power, opulence, all human happiness extending as far\r\nas eye could reach; a map of enjoyments spread out to the horizon; a\r\nsort of radiant geography of which he was the centre. A perilous mirage!\r\n\r\nImagine what must have been the haze of such a vision, not led up to,\r\nnot attained to as by the gradual steps of a ladder, but reached without\r\ntransition and without previous warning.\r\n\r\nA man going to sleep in a mole’s burrow, and awaking on the top of the\r\nStrasbourg steeple; such was the state of Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nGiddiness is a dangerous kind of glare, particularly that which bears\r\nyou at once towards the day and towards the night, forming two\r\nwhirlwinds, one opposed to the other.\r\n\r\nHe saw too much, and not enough.\r\n\r\nHe saw all, and nothing.\r\n\r\nHis state was what the author of this book has somewhere expressed as\r\nthe blind man dazzled.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, left by himself, began to walk with long strides. A bubbling\r\nprecedes an explosion.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his agitation, in this impossibility of keeping still,\r\nhe meditated. His mind liquefied as it boiled. He began to recall things\r\nto his memory. It is surprising how we find that we have heard so\r\nclearly that to which we scarcely listened. The declaration of the\r\nshipwrecked men, read by the sheriff in the Southwark cell, came back to\r\nhim clearly and intelligibly. He recalled every word, he saw under it\r\nhis whole infancy.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he stopped, his hands clasped behind his back, looking up to\r\nthe ceilings--the sky--no matter what--whatever was above him.\r\n\r\n“Quits!” he cried.\r\n\r\nHe felt like one whose head rises out of the water. It seemed to him\r\nthat he saw everything--the past, the future, the present--in the\r\naccession of a sudden flash of light.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” he cried, for there are cries in the depths of thought. “Oh! it\r\nwas so, was it! I was a lord. All is discovered. They stole, betrayed,\r\ndestroyed, abandoned, disinherited, murdered me! The corpse of my\r\ndestiny floated fifteen years on the sea; all at once it touched the\r\nearth, and it started up, erect and living. I am reborn. I am born. I\r\nfelt under my rags that the breast there palpitating was not that of a\r\nwretch; and when I looked on crowds of men, I felt that they were the\r\nflocks, and that I was not the dog, but the shepherd! Shepherds of the\r\npeople, leaders of men, guides and masters, such were my fathers; and\r\nwhat they were I am! I am a gentleman, and I have a sword; I am a baron,\r\nand I have a casque; I am a marquis, and I have a plume; I am a peer,\r\nand I have a coronet. Lo! they deprived me of all this. I dwelt in\r\nlight, they flung me into darkness. Those who proscribed the father,\r\nsold the son. When my father was dead, they took from beneath his head\r\nthe stone of exile which he had placed for his pillow, and, tying it to\r\nmy neck, they flung me into a sewer. Oh! those scoundrels who tortured\r\nmy infancy! Yes, they rise and move in the depths of my memory. Yes; I\r\nsee them again. I was that morsel of flesh pecked to pieces on a tomb by\r\na flight of crows. I bled and cried under all those horrible shadows.\r\nLo! it was there that they precipitated me, under the crush of those who\r\ncome and go, under the trampling feet of men, under the undermost of the\r\nhuman race, lower than the serf, baser than the serving man, lower than\r\nthe felon, lower than the slave, at the spot where Chaos becomes a\r\nsewer, in which I was engulfed. It is from thence that I come; it is\r\nfrom this that I rise; it is from this that I am risen. And here I am\r\nnow. Quits!”\r\n\r\nHe sat down, he rose, clasped his head with his hands, began to pace the\r\nroom again, and his tempestuous monologue continued within him.\r\n\r\n“Where am I?--on the summit? Where is it that I have just alighted?--on\r\nthe highest peak? This pinnacle, this grandeur, this dome of the world,\r\nthis great power, is my home. This temple is in air. I am one of the\r\ngods. I live in inaccessible heights. This supremacy, which I looked up\r\nto from below, and from whence emanated such rays of glory that I shut\r\nmy eyes; this ineffaceable peerage; this impregnable fortress of the\r\nfortunate, I enter. I am in it. I am of it. Ah, what a decisive turn of\r\nthe wheel! I was below, I am on high--on high for ever! Behold me a\r\nlord! I shall have a scarlet robe. I shall have an earl’s coronet on my\r\nhead. I shall assist at the coronation of kings. They will take the oath\r\nfrom my hands. I shall judge princes and ministers. I shall exist. From\r\nthe depths into which I was thrown, I have rebounded to the zenith. I\r\nhave palaces in town and country: houses, gardens, chases, forests,\r\ncarriages, millions. I will give fêtes. I will make laws. I shall have\r\nthe choice of joys and pleasures. And the vagabond Gwynplaine, who had\r\nnot the right to gather a flower in the grass, may pluck the stars from\r\nheaven!”\r\n\r\nMelancholy overshadowing of a soul’s brightness! Thus it was that in\r\nGwynplaine, who had been a hero, and perhaps had not ceased to be one,\r\nmoral greatness gave way to material splendour. A lamentable transition!\r\nVirtue broken down by a troop of passing demons. A surprise made on the\r\nweak side of man’s fortress. All the inferior circumstances called by\r\nmen superior, ambition, the purblind desires of instinct, passions,\r\ncovetousness, driven far from Gwynplaine by the wholesome restraints of\r\nmisfortune, took tumultuous possession of his generous heart. And from\r\nwhat had this arisen? From the discovery of a parchment in a waif\r\ndrifted by the sea. Conscience may be violated by a chance attack.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine drank in great draughts of pride, and it dulled his soul.\r\nSuch is the poison of that fatal wine.\r\n\r\nGiddiness invaded him. He more than consented to its approach. He\r\nwelcomed it. This was the effect of previous and long-continued thirst.\r\nAre we an accomplice of the cup which deprives us of reason? He had\r\nalways vaguely desired this. His eyes had always turned towards the\r\ngreat. To watch is to wish. The eaglet is not born in the eyrie for\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nNow, however, at moments, it seemed to him the simplest thing in the\r\nworld that he should be a lord. A few hours only had passed, and yet the\r\npast of yesterday seemed so far off! Gwynplaine had fallen into the\r\nambuscade of Better, who is the enemy of Good.\r\n\r\nUnhappy is he of whom we say, how lucky he is! Adversity is more easily\r\nresisted than prosperity. We rise more perfect from ill fortune than\r\nfrom good. There is a Charybdis in poverty, and a Scylla in riches.\r\nThose who remain erect under the thunderbolt are prostrated by the\r\nflash. Thou who standest without shrinking on the verge of a precipice,\r\nfear lest thou be carried up on the innumerable wings of mists and\r\ndreams. The ascent which elevates will dwarf thee. An apotheosis has a\r\nsinister power of degradation.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to understand what is good luck. Chance is nothing but a\r\ndisguise. Nothing deceives so much as the face of fortune. Is she\r\nProvidence? Is she Fatality?\r\n\r\nA brightness may not be a brightness, because light is truth, and a\r\ngleam may be a deceit. You believe that it lights you; but no, it sets\r\nyou on fire.\r\n\r\nAt night, a candle made of mean tallow becomes a star if placed in an\r\nopening in the darkness. The moth flies to it.\r\n\r\nIn what measure is the moth responsible?\r\n\r\nThe sight of the candle fascinates the moth as the eye of the serpent\r\nfascinates the bird.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that the bird and the moth should resist the attraction?\r\nIs it possible that the leaf should resist the wind? Is it possible that\r\nthe stone should refuse obedience to the laws of gravitation?\r\n\r\nThese are material questions, which are moral questions as well.\r\n\r\nAfter he had received the letter of the duchess, Gwynplaine had\r\nrecovered himself. The deep love in his nature had resisted it. But the\r\nstorm having wearied itself on one side of the horizon, burst out on the\r\nother; for in destiny, as in nature, there are successive convulsions.\r\nThe first shock loosens, the second uproots.\r\n\r\nAlas! how do the oaks fall?\r\n\r\nThus he who, when a child of ten, stood alone on the shore of Portland,\r\nready to give battle, who had looked steadfastly at all the combatants\r\nwhom he had to encounter, the blast which bore away the vessel in which\r\nhe had expected to embark, the gulf which had swallowed up the plank,\r\nthe yawning abyss, of which the menace was its retrocession, the earth\r\nwhich refused him a shelter, the sky which refused him a star, solitude\r\nwithout pity, obscurity without notice, ocean, sky, all the violence of\r\none infinite space, and all the mysterious enigmas of another; he who\r\nhad neither trembled nor fainted before the mighty hostility of the\r\nunknown; he who, still so young, had held his own with night, as\r\nHercules of old had held his own with death; he who in the unequal\r\nstruggle had thrown down this defiance, that he, a child, adopted a\r\nchild, that he encumbered himself with a load, when tired and exhausted,\r\nthus rendering himself an easier prey to the attacks on his weakness,\r\nand, as it were, himself unmuzzling the shadowy monsters in ambush\r\naround him; he who, a precocious warrior, had immediately, and from his\r\nfirst steps out of the cradle, struggled breast to breast with destiny;\r\nhe, whose disproportion with strife had not discouraged from striving;\r\nhe who, perceiving in everything around him a frightful occultation of\r\nthe human race, had accepted that eclipse, and proudly continued his\r\njourney; he who had known how to endure cold, thirst, hunger, valiantly;\r\nhe who, a pigmy in stature, had been a colossus in soul: this\r\nGwynplaine, who had conquered the great terror of the abyss under its\r\ndouble form, Tempest and Misery, staggered under a breath--Vanity.\r\n\r\nThus, when she has exhausted distress, nakedness, storms, catastrophes,\r\nagonies on an unflinching man, Fatality begins to smile, and her victim,\r\nsuddenly intoxicated, staggers.\r\n\r\nThe smile of Fatality! Can anything more terrible be imagined? It is the\r\nlast resource of the pitiless trier of souls in his proof of man. The\r\ntiger, lurking in destiny, caresses man with a velvet paw. Sinister\r\npreparation, hideous gentleness in the monster!\r\n\r\nEvery self-observer has detected within himself mental weakness\r\ncoincident with aggrandisement. A sudden growth disturbs the system, and\r\nproduces fever.\r\n\r\nIn Gwynplaine’s brain was the giddy whirlwind of a crowd of new\r\ncircumstances; all the light and shade of a metamorphosis; inexpressibly\r\nstrange confrontations; the shock of the past against the future. Two\r\nGwynplaines, himself doubled; behind, an infant in rags crawling through\r\nnight--wandering, shivering, hungry, provoking laughter; in front, a\r\nbrilliant nobleman--luxurious, proud, dazzling all London. He was\r\ncasting off one form, and amalgamating himself with the other. He was\r\ncasting the mountebank, and becoming the peer. Change of skin is\r\nsometimes change of soul. Now and then the past seemed like a dream. It\r\nwas complex; bad and good. He thought of his father. It was a poignant\r\nanguish never to have known his father. He tried to picture him to\r\nhimself. He thought of his brother, of whom he had just heard. Then he\r\nhad a family! He, Gwynplaine! He lost himself in fantastic dreams. He\r\nsaw visions of magnificence; unknown forms of solemn grandeur moved in\r\nmist before him. He heard flourishes of trumpets.\r\n\r\n“And then,” he said, “I shall be eloquent.”\r\n\r\nHe pictured to himself a splendid entrance into the House of Lords. He\r\nshould arrive full to the brim with new facts and ideas. What could he\r\nnot tell them? What subjects he had accumulated! What an advantage to be\r\nin the midst of them, a man who had seen, touched, undergone, and\r\nsuffered; who could cry aloud to them, “I have been near to everything,\r\nfrom which you are so far removed.” He would hurl reality in the face of\r\nthose patricians, crammed with illusions. They should tremble, for it\r\nwould be the truth. They would applaud, for it would be grand. He would\r\narise amongst those powerful men, more powerful than they. “I shall\r\nappear as a torch-bearer, to show them truth; and as a sword-bearer, to\r\nshow them justice!” What a triumph!\r\n\r\nAnd, building up these fantasies in his mind, clear and confused at the\r\nsame time, he had attacks of delirium,--sinking on the first seat he\r\ncame to; sometimes drowsy, sometimes starting up. He came and went,\r\nlooked at the ceiling, examined the coronets, studied vaguely the\r\nhieroglyphics of the emblazonment, felt the velvet of the walls, moved\r\nthe chairs, turned over the parchments, read the names, spelt out the\r\ntitles, Buxton, Homble, Grundraith, Hunkerville, Clancharlie; compared\r\nthe wax, the impression, felt the twist of silk appended to the royal\r\nprivy seal, approached the window, listened to the splash of the\r\nfountain, contemplated the statues, counted, with the patience of a\r\nsomnambulist, the columns of marble, and said,--\r\n\r\n“It is real.”\r\n\r\nThen he touched his satin clothes, and asked himself,--\r\n\r\n“Is it I? Yes.”\r\n\r\nHe was torn by an inward tempest.\r\n\r\nIn this whirlwind, did he feel faintness and fatigue? Did he drink, eat,\r\nsleep? If he did so, he was unconscious of the fact. In certain violent\r\nsituations instinct satisfies itself, according to its requirements,\r\nunconsciously. Besides, his thoughts were less thoughts than mists. At\r\nthe moment that the black flame of an irruption disgorges itself from\r\ndepths full of boiling lava, has the crater any consciousness of the\r\nflocks which crop the grass at the foot of the mountain?\r\n\r\nThe hours passed.\r\n\r\nThe dawn appeared and brought the day. A bright ray penetrated the\r\nchamber, and at the same instant broke on the soul of Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nAnd Dea! said the light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE SIXTH.\r\n\r\n_URSUS UNDER DIFFERENT ASPECTS._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nWHAT THE MISANTHROPE SAID.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Ursus had seen Gwynplaine thrust within the gates of Southwark\r\nJail, he remained, haggard, in the corner from which he was watching.\r\nFor a long time his ears were haunted by the grinding of the bolts and\r\nbars, which was like a howl of joy that one wretch more should be\r\nenclosed within them.\r\n\r\nHe waited. What for? He watched. What for? Such inexorable doors, once\r\nshut, do not re-open so soon. They are tongue-tied by their stagnation\r\nin darkness, and move with difficulty, especially when they have to give\r\nup a prisoner. Entrance is permitted. Exit is quite a different matter.\r\nUrsus knew this. But waiting is a thing which we have not the power to\r\ngive up at our own will. We wait in our own despite. What we do\r\ndisengages an acquired force, which maintains its action when its object\r\nhas ceased, which keeps possession of us and holds us, and obliges us\r\nfor some time longer to continue that which has already lost its motive.\r\nHence the useless watch, the inert position that we have all held at\r\ntimes, the loss of time which every thoughtful man gives mechanically to\r\nthat which has disappeared. None escapes this law. We become stubborn in\r\na sort of vague fury. We know not why we are in the place, but we remain\r\nthere. That which we have begun actively we continue passively, with an\r\nexhausting tenacity from which we emerge overwhelmed. Ursus, though\r\ndiffering from other men, was, as any other might have been, nailed to\r\nhis post by that species of conscious reverie into which we are plunged\r\nby events all important to us, and in which we are impotent. He\r\nscrutinized by turns those two black walls, now the high one, then the\r\nlow; sometimes the door near which the ladder to the gibbet stood, then\r\nthat surmounted by a death’s head. It was as if he were caught in a\r\nvice, composed of a prison and a cemetery. This shunned and unpopular\r\nstreet was so deserted that he was unobserved.\r\n\r\nAt length he left the arch under which he had taken shelter, a kind of\r\nchance sentry-box, in which he had acted the watchman, and departed with\r\nslow steps. The day was declining, for his guard had been long. From\r\ntime to time he turned his head and looked at the fearful wicket through\r\nwhich Gwynplaine had disappeared. His eyes were glassy and dull. He\r\nreached the end of the alley, entered another, then another, retracing\r\nalmost unconsciously the road which he had taken some hours before. At\r\nintervals he turned, as if he could still see the door of the prison,\r\nthough he was no longer in the street in which the jail was situated.\r\nStep by step he was approaching Tarrinzeau Field. The lanes in the\r\nneighbourhood of the fair-ground were deserted pathways between enclosed\r\ngardens. He walked along, his head bent down, by the hedges and ditches.\r\nAll at once he halted, and drawing himself up, exclaimed, “So much the\r\nbetter!”\r\n\r\nAt the same time he struck his fist twice on his head and twice on his\r\nthigh, thus proving himself to be a sensible fellow, who saw things in\r\ntheir right light; and then he began to growl inwardly, yet now and then\r\nraising his voice.\r\n\r\n“It is all right! Oh, the scoundrel! the thief! the vagabond! the\r\nworthless fellow! the seditious scamp! It is his speeches about the\r\ngovernment that have sent him there. He is a rebel. I was harbouring a\r\nrebel. I am free of him, and lucky for me; he was compromising us.\r\nThrust into prison! Oh, so much the better! What excellent laws!\r\nUngrateful boy! I who brought him up! To give oneself so much trouble\r\nfor this! Why should he want to speak and to reason? He mixed himself up\r\nin politics. The ass! As he handled pennies he babbled about the taxes,\r\nabout the poor, about the people, about what was no business of his. He\r\npermitted himself to make reflections on pennies. He commented wickedly\r\nand maliciously on the copper money of the kingdom. He insulted the\r\nfarthings of her Majesty. A farthing! Why, ’tis the same as the queen. A\r\nsacred effigy! Devil take it! a sacred effigy! Have we a queen--yes or\r\nno? Then respect her verdigris! Everything depends on the government;\r\none ought to know that. I have experience, I have. I know something.\r\nThey may say to me, ‘But you give up politics, then?’ Politics, my\r\nfriends! I care as much for them as for the rough hide of an ass. I\r\nreceived, one day, a blow from a baronet’s cane. I said to myself, That\r\nis enough: I understand politics. The people have but a farthing, they\r\ngive it; the queen takes it, the people thank her. Nothing can be more\r\nnatural. It is for the peers to arrange the rest; their lordships, the\r\nlords spiritual and temporal. Oh! so Gwynplaine is locked up! So he is\r\nin prison. That is just as it should be. It is equitable, excellent,\r\nwell-merited, and legitimate. It is his own fault. To criticize is\r\nforbidden. Are you a lord, you idiot? The constable has seized him, the\r\njustice of the quorum has carried him off, the sheriff has him in\r\ncustody. At this moment he is probably being examined by a serjeant of\r\nthe coif. They pluck out your crimes, those clever fellows! Imprisoned,\r\nmy wag! So much the worse for him, so much the better for me! Faith, I\r\nam satisfied. I own frankly that fortune favours me. Of what folly was I\r\nguilty when I picked up that little boy and girl! We were so quiet\r\nbefore, Homo and I! What had they to do in my caravan, the little\r\nblackguards? Didn’t I brood over them when they were young! Didn’t I\r\ndraw them along with my harness! Pretty foundlings, indeed; he as ugly\r\nas sin, and she blind of both eyes! Where was the use of depriving\r\nmyself of everything for their sakes? The beggars grow up, forsooth, and\r\nmake love to each other. The flirtations of the deformed! It was to that\r\nwe had come. The toad and the mole; quite an idyl! That was what went on\r\nin my household. All which was sure to end by going before the justice.\r\nThe toad talked politics! But now I am free of him. When the wapentake\r\ncame I was at first a fool; one always doubts one’s own good luck. I\r\nbelieved that I did not see what I did see; that it was impossible, that\r\nit was a nightmare, that a day-dream was playing me a trick. But no!\r\nNothing could be truer. It is all clear. Gwynplaine is really in\r\nprison. It is a stroke of Providence. Praise be to it! He was the\r\nmonster who, with the row he made, drew attention to my establishment\r\nand denounced my poor wolf. Be off, Gwynplaine; and, see, I am rid of\r\nboth! Two birds killed with one stone. Because Dea will die, now that\r\nshe can no longer see Gwynplaine. For she sees him, the idiot! She will\r\nhave no object in life. She will say, ‘What am I to do in the world?’\r\nGood-bye! To the devil with both of them. I always hated the creatures!\r\nDie, Dea! Oh, I am quite comfortable!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWHAT HE DID.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe returned to the Tadcaster Inn,\r\n\r\nIt struck half-past six. It was a little before twilight.\r\n\r\nMaster Nicless stood on his doorstep.\r\n\r\nHe had not succeeded, since the morning, in extinguishing the terror\r\nwhich still showed on his scared face.\r\n\r\nHe perceived Ursus from afar.\r\n\r\n“Well!” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Well! what?”\r\n\r\n“Is Gwynplaine coming back? It is full time. The public will soon be\r\ncoming. Shall we have the performance of ‘The Laughing Man’ this\r\nevening?”\r\n\r\n“I am the laughing man,” said Ursus.\r\n\r\nAnd he looked at the tavern-keeper with a loud chuckle.\r\n\r\nThen he went up to the first floor, opened the window next to the sign\r\nof the inn, leant over towards the placard about Gwynplaine, the\r\nlaughing man, and the bill of “Chaos Vanquished;” unnailed the one, tore\r\ndown the other, put both under his arm, and descended.\r\n\r\nMaster Nicless followed him with his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Why do you unhook that?”\r\n\r\nUrsus burst into a second fit of laughter.\r\n\r\n“Why do you laugh?” said the tavern-keeper.\r\n\r\n“I am re-entering private life.”\r\n\r\nMaster Nicless understood, and gave an order to his lieutenant, the boy\r\nGovicum, to announce to every one who should come that there would be no\r\nperformance that evening. He took from the door the box made out of a\r\ncask, where they received the entrance money, and rolled it into a\r\ncorner of the lower sitting-room.\r\n\r\nA moment after, Ursus entered the Green Box.\r\n\r\nHe put the two signs away in a corner, and entered what he called the\r\nwoman’s wing.\r\n\r\nDea was asleep.\r\n\r\nShe was on her bed, dressed as usual, excepting that the body of her\r\ngown was loosened, as when she was taking her siesta.\r\n\r\nNear her Vinos and Fibi were sitting--one on a stool, the other on the\r\nground--musing. Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, they had not\r\ndressed themselves in their goddesses’ gauze, which was a sign of deep\r\ndiscouragement. They had remained in their drugget petticoats and their\r\ndress of coarse cloth.\r\n\r\nUrsus looked at Dea.\r\n\r\n“She is rehearsing for a longer sleep,” murmured he.\r\n\r\nThen, addressing Fibi and Vinos,--\r\n\r\n“You both know all. The music is over. You may put your trumpets into\r\nthe drawer. You did well not to equip yourselves as deities. You look\r\nugly enough as you are, but you were quite right. Keep on your\r\npetticoats. No performance to-night, nor to-morrow, nor the day after\r\nto-morrow. No Gwynplaine. Gwynplaine is clean gone.”\r\n\r\nThen he looked at Dea again.\r\n\r\n“What a blow to her this will be! It will be like blowing out a candle.”\r\n\r\nHe inflated his cheeks.\r\n\r\n“Puff! nothing more.”\r\n\r\nThen, with a little dry laugh,--\r\n\r\n“Losing Gwynplaine, she loses all. It would be just as if I were to lose\r\nHomo. It will be worse. She will feel more lonely than any one else\r\ncould. The blind wade through more sorrow than we do.”\r\n\r\nHe looked out of the window at the end of the room.\r\n\r\n“How the days lengthen! It is not dark at seven o’clock. Nevertheless we\r\nwill light up.”\r\n\r\nHe struck the steel and lighted the lamp which hung from the ceiling of\r\nthe Green Box.\r\n\r\nThen he leaned over Dea.\r\n\r\n“She will catch cold; you have unlaced her bodice too low. There is a\r\nproverb,--\r\n\r\n  “‘Though April skies be bright,\r\n  Keep all your wrappers tight.’”\r\n\r\nSeeing a pin shining on the floor, he picked it up and pinned up her\r\nsleeve. Then he paced the Green Box, gesticulating.\r\n\r\n“I am in full possession of my faculties. I am lucid, quite lucid. I\r\nconsider this occurrence quite proper, and I approve of what has\r\nhappened. When she awakes I will explain everything to her clearly. The\r\ncatastrophe will not be long in coming. No more Gwynplaine. Good-night,\r\nDea. How well all has been arranged! Gwynplaine in prison, Dea in the\r\ncemetery, they will be _vis-à-vis_! A dance of death! Two destinies\r\ngoing off the stage at once. Pack up the dresses. Fasten the valise. For\r\nvalise, read coffin. It was just what was best for them both. Dea\r\nwithout eyes, Gwynplaine without a face. On high the Almighty will\r\nrestore sight to Dea and beauty to Gwynplaine. Death puts things to\r\nrights. All will be well. Fibi, Vinos, hang up your tambourines on the\r\nnail. Your talents for noise will go to rust, my beauties; no more\r\nplaying, no more trumpeting ‘Chaos Vanquished’ is vanquished. ‘The\r\nLaughing Man’ is done for. ‘Taratantara’ is dead. Dea sleeps on. She\r\ndoes well. If I were she I would never awake. Oh! she will soon fall\r\nasleep again. A skylark like her takes very little killing. This comes\r\nof meddling with politics. What a lesson! Governments are right.\r\nGwynplaine to the sheriff. Dea to the grave-digger. Parallel cases!\r\nInstructive symmetry! I hope the tavern-keeper has barred the door. We\r\nare going to die to-night quietly at home, between ourselves--not I, nor\r\nHomo, but Dea. As for me, I shall continue to roll on in the caravan. I\r\nbelong to the meanderings of vagabond life. I shall dismiss these two\r\nwomen. I shall not keep even one of them. I have a tendency to become an\r\nold scoundrel. A maidservant in the house of a libertine is like a loaf\r\nof bread on the shelf. I decline the temptation. It is not becoming at\r\nmy age. _Turpe senilis amor_. I will follow my way alone with Homo. How\r\nastonished Homo will be! Where is Gwynplaine? Where is Dea? Old comrade,\r\nhere we are once more alone together. Plague take it! I’m delighted.\r\nTheir bucolics were an encumbrance. Oh! that scamp Gwynplaine, who is\r\nnever coming back. He has left us stuck here. I say ‘All right.’ And\r\nnow ’tis Dea’s turn. That won’t be long. I like things to be done with.\r\nI would not snap my fingers to stop her dying--her dying, I tell you!\r\nSee, she awakes!”\r\n\r\nDea opened her eyelids; many blind persons shut them when they sleep.\r\nHer sweet unwitting face wore all its usual radiance.\r\n\r\n“She smiles,” whispered Ursus, “and I laugh. That is as it should be.”\r\n\r\nDea called,--\r\n\r\n“Fibi! Vinos! It must be the time for the performance. I think I have\r\nbeen asleep a long time. Come and dress me.”\r\n\r\nNeither Fibi nor Vinos moved.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the ineffable blind look of Dea’s eyes met those of Ursus. He\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n“Well!” he cried; “what are you about? Vinos! Fibi! Do you not hear your\r\nmistress? Are you deaf? Quick! the play is going to begin.”\r\n\r\nThe two women looked at Ursus in stupefaction.\r\n\r\nUrsus shouted,--\r\n\r\n“Do you not hear the audience coming in?--Fibi, dress Dea.--Vinos, take\r\nyour tambourine.”\r\n\r\nFibi was obedient; Vinos, passive. Together, they personified\r\nsubmission. Their master, Ursus, had always been to them an enigma.\r\nNever to be understood is a reason for being always obeyed. They simply\r\nthought he had gone mad, and did as they were told. Fibi took down the\r\ncostume, and Vinos the tambourine.\r\n\r\nFibi began to dress Dea. Ursus let down the door-curtain of the women’s\r\nroom, and from behind the curtain continued,--\r\n\r\n“Look there, Gwynplaine! the court is already more than half full of\r\npeople. They are in heaps in the passages. What a crowd! And you say\r\nthat Fibi and Vinos look as if they did not see them. How stupid the\r\ngipsies are! What fools they are in Egypt! Don’t lift the curtain from\r\nthe door. Be decent. Dea is dressing.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, and suddenly they heard an exclamation,--\r\n\r\n“How beautiful Dea is!”\r\n\r\nIt was the voice of Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nFibi and Vinos started, and turned round. It was the voice of\r\nGwynplaine, but in the mouth of Ursus.\r\n\r\nUrsus, by a sign which he made through the door ajar, forbade the\r\nexpression of any astonishment.\r\n\r\nThen, again taking the voice of Gwynplaine,--\r\n\r\n“Angel!”\r\n\r\nThen he replied in his own voice,--\r\n\r\n“Dea an angel! You are a fool, Gwynplaine. No mammifer can fly except\r\nthe bats.”\r\n\r\nAnd he added,--\r\n\r\n“Look here, Gwynplaine! Let Homo loose; that will be more to the\r\npurpose.”\r\n\r\nAnd he descended the ladder of the Green Box very quickly, with the\r\nagile spring of Gwynplaine, imitating his step so that Dea could hear\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn the court he addressed the boy, whom the occurrences of the day had\r\nmade idle and inquisitive.\r\n\r\n“Spread out both your hands,” said he, in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nAnd he poured a handful of pence into them.\r\n\r\nGovicum was grateful for his munificence.\r\n\r\nUrsus whispered in his ear,--\r\n\r\n“Boy, go into the yard; jump, dance, knock, bawl, whistle, coo, neigh,\r\napplaud, stamp your feet, burst out laughing, break something.”\r\n\r\nMaster Nicless, saddened and humiliated at seeing the folks who had come\r\nto see “The Laughing Man” turned back and crowding towards other\r\ncaravans, had shut the door of the inn. He had even given up the idea of\r\nselling any beer or spirits that evening, that he might have to answer\r\nno awkward questions; and, quite overcome by the sudden close of the\r\nperformance, was looking, with his candle in his hand, into the court\r\nfrom the balcony above.\r\n\r\nUrsus, taking the precaution of putting his voice between parentheses\r\nfashioned by adjusting the palms of his hands to his mouth, cried out to\r\nhim,--\r\n\r\n“Sir! do as your boy is doing--yelp, bark, howl.”\r\n\r\nHe re-ascended the steps of the Green Box, and said to the wolf,--\r\n\r\n“_Talk_ as much as you can.”\r\n\r\nThen, raising his voice,--\r\n\r\n“What a crowd there is! We shall have a crammed performance.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Vinos played the tambourine. Ursus went on,--\r\n\r\n“Dea is dressed. Now we can begin. I am sorry they have admitted so\r\nmany spectators. How thickly packed they are!--Look, Gwynplaine, what a\r\nmad mob it is! I will bet that to-day we shall take more money than we\r\nhave ever done yet.--Come, gipsies, play up, both of you. Come\r\nhere.--Fibi, take your clarion. Good.--Vinos, drum on your tambourine.\r\nFling it up and catch it again.--Fibi, put yourself into the attitude of\r\nFame.--Young ladies, you have too much on. Take off those jackets.\r\nReplace stuff by gauze. The public like to see the female form exposed.\r\nLet the moralists thunder. A little indecency. Devil take it! what of\r\nthat? Look voluptuous, and rush into wild melodies. Snort, blow,\r\nwhistle, flourish, play the tambourine.--What a number of people, my\r\npoor Gwynplaine!”\r\n\r\nHe interrupted himself.\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine, help me. Let down the platform.” He spread out his\r\npocket-handkerchief. “But first let me roar in my rag,” and he blew his\r\nnose violently as a ventriloquist ought. Having returned his\r\nhandkerchief to his pocket, he drew the pegs out of the pulleys, which\r\ncreaked as usual as the platform was let down.\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine, do not draw the curtain until the performance begins. We\r\nare not alone.--You two come on in front. Music, ladies! turn, turn,\r\nturn.--A pretty audience we have! the dregs of the people. Good\r\nheavens!”\r\n\r\nThe two gipsies, stupidly obedient, placed themselves in their usual\r\ncorners of the platform. Then Ursus became wonderful. It was no longer a\r\nman, but a crowd. Obliged to make abundance out of emptiness, he called\r\nto aid his prodigious powers of ventriloquism. The whole orchestra of\r\nhuman and animal voices which was within him he called into tumult at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nHe was legion. Any one with his eyes closed would have imagined that he\r\nwas in a public place on some day of rejoicing, or in some sudden\r\npopular riot. A whirlwind of clamour proceeded from Ursus: he sang, he\r\nshouted, he talked, he coughed, he spat, he sneezed, took snuff, talked\r\nand responded, put questions and gave answers, all at once. The\r\nhalf-uttered syllables ran one into another. In the court, untenanted by\r\na single spectator, were heard men, women, and children. It was a clear\r\nconfusion of tumult. Strange laughter wound, vapour-like, through the\r\nnoise, the chirping of birds, the swearing of cats, the wailings of\r\nchildren at the breast. The indistinct tones of drunken men were to be\r\nheard, and the growls of dogs under the feet of people who stamped on\r\nthem. The cries came from far and near, from top to bottom, from the\r\nupper boxes to the pit. The whole was an uproar, the detail was a cry.\r\nUrsus clapped his hands, stamped his feet, threw his voice to the end of\r\nthe court, and then made it come from underground. It was both stormy\r\nand familiar. It passed from a murmur to a noise, from a noise to a\r\ntumult, from a tumult to a tempest. He was himself, any, every one else.\r\nAlone, and polyglot. As there are optical illusions, there are also\r\nauricular illusions. That which Proteus did to sight Ursus did to\r\nhearing. Nothing could be more marvellous than his facsimile of\r\nmultitude. From time to time he opened the door of the women’s apartment\r\nand looked at Dea. Dea was listening. On his part the boy exerted\r\nhimself to the utmost. Vinos and Fibi trumpeted conscientiously, and\r\ntook turns with the tambourine. Master Nicless, the only spectator,\r\nquietly made himself the same explanation as they did--that Ursus was\r\ngone mad; which was, for that matter, but another sad item added to his\r\nmisery. The good tavern-keeper growled out, “What insanity!” And he was\r\nserious as a man might well be who has the fear of the law before him.\r\n\r\nGovicum, delighted at being able to help in making a noise, exerted\r\nhimself almost as much as Ursus. It amused him, and, moreover, it earned\r\nhim pence.\r\n\r\nHomo was pensive.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the tumult Ursus now and then uttered such words as\r\nthese:--“Just as usual, Gwynplaine. There is a cabal against us. Our\r\nrivals are undermining our success. Tumult is the seasoning of triumph.\r\nBesides, there are too many people. They are uncomfortable. The angles\r\nof their neighbours’ elbows do not dispose them to good-nature. I hope\r\nthe benches will not give way. We shall be the victims of an incensed\r\npopulation. Oh, if our friend Tom-Jim-Jack were only here! but he never\r\ncomes now. Look at those heads rising one above the other. Those who are\r\nforced to stand don’t look very well pleased, though the great Galen\r\npronounced it to be strengthening. We will shorten the entertainment; as\r\nonly ‘Chaos Vanquished’ was announced in the playbill, we will not play\r\n‘Ursus Rursus.’ There will be something gained in that. What an uproar!\r\nO blind turbulence of the masses. They will do us some damage. However,\r\nthey can’t go on like this. We should not be able to play. No one can\r\ncatch a word of the piece. I am going to address them. Gwynplaine, draw\r\nthe curtain a little aside.--Gentlemen.” Here Ursus addressed himself\r\nwith a shrill and feeble voice,--\r\n\r\n“Down with that old fool!”\r\n\r\nThen he answered in his own voice,--\r\n\r\n“It seems that the mob insult me. Cicero is right: _plebs fex urbis_.\r\nNever mind; we will admonish the mob, though I shall have a great deal\r\nof trouble to make myself heard. I will speak, notwithstanding. Man, do\r\nyour duty. Gwynplaine, look at that scold grinding her teeth down\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\nUrsus made a pause, in which he placed a gnashing of his teeth. Homo,\r\nprovoked, added a second, and Govicum a third.\r\n\r\nUrsus went on,--\r\n\r\n“The women are worse than the men. The moment is unpropitious, but it\r\ndoesn’t matter! Let us try the power of a speech; an eloquent speech is\r\nnever out of place. Listen, Gwynplaine, to my attractive exordium.\r\nLadies and gentlemen, I am a bear. I take off my head to address you. I\r\nhumbly appeal to you for silence.” Ursus, lending a cry to the crowd,\r\nsaid, “Grumphll!”\r\n\r\nThen he continued,--\r\n\r\n“I respect my audience. Grumphll is an epiphonema as good as any other\r\nwelcome. You growlers. That you are all of the dregs of the people, I do\r\nnot doubt. That in no way diminishes my esteem for you. A\r\nwell-considered esteem. I have a profound respect for the bullies who\r\nhonour me with their custom. There are deformed folks amongst you. They\r\ngive me no offence. The lame and the humpbacked are works of nature. The\r\ncamel is gibbous. The bison’s back is humped. The badger’s left legs are\r\nshorter than the right, That fact is decided by Aristotle, in his\r\ntreatise on the walking of animals. There are those amongst you who have\r\nbut two shirts--one on his back, and the other at the pawnbroker’s. I\r\nknow that to be true. Albuquerque pawned his moustache, and St. Denis\r\nhis glory. The Jews advanced money on the glory. Great examples. To have\r\ndebts is to have something. I revere your beggardom.”\r\n\r\nUrsus cut short his speech, interrupting it in a deep bass voice by the\r\nshout,--\r\n\r\n“Triple ass!”\r\n\r\nAnd he answered in his politest accent,--\r\n\r\n“I admit it. I am a learned man. I do my best to apologize for it. I\r\nscientifically despise science. Ignorance is a reality on which we feed;\r\nscience is a reality on which we starve. In general one is obliged to\r\nchoose between two things--to be learned and grow thin, or to browse and\r\nbe an ass. O gentlemen, browse! Science is not worth a mouthful of\r\nanything nice. I had rather eat a sirloin of beef than know what they\r\ncall the psoas muscle. I have but one merit--a dry eye. Such as you see\r\nme, I have never wept. It must be owned that I have never been\r\nsatisfied--never satisfied--not even with myself. I despise myself; but\r\nI submit this to the members of the opposition here present--if Ursus is\r\nonly a learned man, Gwynplaine is an artist.”\r\n\r\nHe groaned again,--\r\n\r\n“Grumphll!”\r\n\r\nAnd resumed,--\r\n\r\n“Grumphll again! it is an objection. All the same, I pass it over. Near\r\nGwynplaine, gentlemen and ladies, is another artist, a valued and\r\ndistinguished personage who accompanies us--his lordship Homo, formerly\r\na wild dog, now a civilized wolf, and a faithful subject of her\r\nMajesty’s. Homo is a mine of deep and superior talent. Be attentive and\r\nwatch. You are going to set Homo play as well as Gwynplaine, and you\r\nmust do honour to art. That is an attribute of great nations. Are you\r\nmen of the woods? I admit the fact. In that case, _sylvæ sunt consule\r\ndigna_. Two artists are well worth one consul. All right! Some one has\r\nflung a cabbage stalk at me, but did not hit me. That will not stop my\r\nspeaking; on the contrary, a danger evaded makes folks garrulous.\r\n_Garrula pericula_, says Juvenal. My hearers! there are amongst you\r\ndrunken men and drunken women. Very well. The men are unwholesome. The\r\nwomen are hideous. You have all sorts of excellent reasons for stowing\r\nyourselves away here on the benches of the pothouse--want of work,\r\nidleness, the spare time between two robberies, porter, ale, stout,\r\nmalt, brandy, gin, and the attraction of one sex for the other. What\r\ncould be better? A wit prone to irony would find this a fair field. But\r\nI abstain. ’Tis luxury; so be it, but even an orgy should be kept\r\nwithin bounds. You are gay, but noisy. You imitate successfully the\r\ncries of beasts; but what would you say if, when you were making love to\r\na lady, I passed my time in barking at you? It would disturb you, and so\r\nit disturbs us. I order you to hold your tongues. Art is as respectable\r\nas debauch. I speak to you civilly.”\r\n\r\nHe apostrophized himself,--\r\n\r\n“May the fever strangle you, with your eyebrows like the beard of rye.”\r\n\r\nAnd he replied,--\r\n\r\n“Honourable gentlemen, let the rye alone. It is impious to insult the\r\nvegetables, by likening them either to human creatures or animals.\r\nBesides, the fever does not strangle. ’Tis a false metaphor. For pity’s\r\nsake, keep silence. Allow me to tell you that you are slightly wanting\r\nin the repose which characterizes the true English gentleman. I see that\r\nsome amongst you, who have shoes out of which their toes are peeping,\r\ntake advantage of the circumstance to rest their feet on the shoulders\r\nof those who are in front of them, causing the ladies to remark that the\r\nsoles of shoes divide always at the part at which is the head of the\r\nmetatarsal bones. Show more of your hands and less of your feet. I\r\nperceive scamps who plunge their ingenious fists into the pockets of\r\ntheir foolish neighbours. Dear pickpockets, have a little modesty. Fight\r\nthose next to you if you like; do not plunder them. You will vex them\r\nless by blackening an eye, than by lightening their purses of a penny.\r\nBreak their noses if you like. The shopkeeper thinks more of his money\r\nthan of his beauty. Barring this, accept my sympathies, for I am not\r\npedantic enough to blame thieves. Evil exists. Every one endures it,\r\nevery one inflicts it. No one is exempt from the vermin of his sins.\r\nThat’s what I keep saying. Have we not all our itch? I myself have made\r\nmistakes. _Plaudite, cives_.”\r\n\r\nUrsus uttered a long groan, which he overpowered by these concluding\r\nwords,--\r\n\r\n“My lords and gentlemen, I see that my address has unluckily displeased\r\nyou. I take leave of your hisses for a moment. I shall put on my head,\r\nand the performance is going to begin.”\r\n\r\nHe dropt his oratorical tone, and resumed his usual voice.\r\n\r\n“Close the curtains. Let me breathe. I have spoken like honey. I have\r\nspoken well. My words were like velvet; but they were useless. I called\r\nthem my lords and gentlemen. What do you think of all this scum,\r\nGwynplaine? How well may we estimate the ills which England has suffered\r\nfor the last forty years through the ill-temper of these irritable and\r\nmalicious spirits! The ancient Britons were warlike; these are\r\nmelancholy and learned. They glory in despising the laws and contemning\r\nroyal authority. I have done all that human eloquence can do. I have\r\nbeen prodigal of metonymics, as gracious as the blooming cheek of youth.\r\nWere they softened by them? I doubt it. What can affect a people who eat\r\nso extraordinarily, who stupefy themselves by tobacco so completely that\r\ntheir literary men often write their works with a pipe in their mouths?\r\nNever mind. Let us begin the play.”\r\n\r\nThe rings of the curtain were heard being drawn over the rod. The\r\ntambourines of the gipsies were still. Ursus took down his instrument,\r\nexecuted his prelude, and said in a low tone: “Alas, Gwynplaine, how\r\nmysterious it is!” then he flung himself down with the wolf.\r\n\r\nWhen he had taken down his instrument, he had also taken from the nail a\r\nrough wig which he had, and which he had thrown on the stage in a corner\r\nwithin his reach. The performance of “Chaos Vanquished” took place as\r\nusual, minus only the effect of the blue light and the brilliancy of the\r\nfairies. The wolf played his best. At the proper moment Dea made her\r\nappearance, and, in her voice so tremulous and heavenly, invoked\r\nGwynplaine. She extended her arms, feeling for that head.\r\n\r\nUrsus rushed at the wig, ruffled it, put it on, advanced softly, and\r\nholding his breath, his head bristled thus under the hand of Dea.\r\n\r\nThen calling all his art to his aid, and copying Gwynplaine’s voice, he\r\nsang with ineffable love the response of the monster to the call of the\r\nspirit. The imitation was so perfect that again the gipsies looked for\r\nGwynplaine, frightened at hearing without seeing him.\r\n\r\nGovicum, filled with astonishment, stamped, applauded, clapped his\r\nhands, producing an Olympian tumult, and himself laughed as if he had\r\nbeen a chorus of gods. This boy, it must be confessed, developed a rare\r\ntalent for acting an audience.\r\n\r\nFibi and Vinos, being automatons of which Ursus pulled the strings,\r\nrattled their instruments, composed of copper and ass’s skin--the usual\r\nsign of the performance being over and of the departure of the people.\r\n\r\nUrsus arose, covered with perspiration. He said, in a low voice, to\r\nHomo, “You see it was necessary to gain time. I think we have succeeded.\r\nI have not acquitted myself badly--I, who have as much reason as any one\r\nto go distracted. Gwynplaine may perhaps return to-morrow. It is useless\r\nto kill Dea directly. I can explain matters to you.”\r\n\r\nHe took off his wig and wiped his forehead.\r\n\r\n“I am a ventriloquist of genius,” murmured he. “What talent I displayed!\r\nI have equalled Brabant, the engastrimist of Francis I. of France. Dea\r\nis convinced that Gwynplaine is here.”\r\n\r\n“Ursus,” said Dea, “where is Gwynplaine?”\r\n\r\nUrsus started and turned round. Dea was still standing at the back of\r\nthe stage, alone under the lamp which hung from the ceiling. She was\r\npale, with the pallor of a ghost.\r\n\r\nShe added, with an ineffable expression of despair,--\r\n\r\n“I know. He has left us. He is gone. I always knew that he had wings.”\r\n\r\nAnd raising her sightless eyes on high, she added,--\r\n\r\n“When shall I follow?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUrsus was stunned.\r\n\r\nHe had not sustained the illusion.\r\n\r\nWas it the fault of ventriloquism? Certainly not. He had succeeded in\r\ndeceiving Fibi and Vinos, who had eyes, although he had not deceived\r\nDea, who was blind. It was because Fibi and Vinos saw with their eyes,\r\nwhile Dea saw with her heart. He could not utter a word. He thought to\r\nhimself, _Bos in lingûa_. The troubled man has an ox on his tongue.\r\n\r\nIn his complex emotions, humiliation was the first which dawned on him.\r\nUrsus, driven out of his last resource, pondered.\r\n\r\n“I lavish my onomatopies in vain.” Then, like every dreamer, he reviled\r\nhimself. “What a frightful failure! I wore myself out in a pure loss of\r\nimitative harmony. But what is to be done next?”\r\n\r\nHe looked at Dea. She was silent, and grew paler every moment, as she\r\nstood perfectly motionless. Her sightless eyes remained fixed in depths\r\nof thought.\r\n\r\nFortunately, something happened. Ursus saw Master Nicless in the yard,\r\nwith a candle in his hand, beckoning to him.\r\n\r\nMaster Nicless had not assisted at the end of the phantom comedy played\r\nby Ursus. Some one had happened to knock at the door of the inn. Master\r\nNicless had gone to open it. There had been two knocks, and twice Master\r\nNicless had disappeared. Ursus, absorbed by his hundred-voiced\r\nmonologue, had not observed his absence.\r\n\r\nOn the mute call of Master Nicless, Ursus descended.\r\n\r\nHe approached the tavern-keeper. Ursus put his finger on his lips.\r\nMaster Nicless put his finger on his lips.\r\n\r\nThe two looked at each other thus.\r\n\r\nEach seemed to say to the other, “We will talk, but we will hold our\r\ntongues.”\r\n\r\nThe tavern-keeper silently opened the door of the lower room of the\r\ntavern. Master Nicless entered. Ursus entered. There was no one there\r\nexcept these two. On the side looking on the street both doors and\r\nwindow-shutters were closed.\r\n\r\nThe tavern-keeper pushed the door behind him, and shut it in the face of\r\nthe inquisitive Govicum.\r\n\r\nMaster Nicless placed the candle on the table.\r\n\r\nA low whispering dialogue began.\r\n\r\n“Master Ursus?”\r\n\r\n“Master Nicless?”\r\n\r\n“I understand at last.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“You wished the poor blind girl to think that all going on as usual.”\r\n\r\n“There is no law against my being a ventriloquist.”\r\n\r\n“You are a clever fellow.”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“It is wonderful how you manage all that you wish to do.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you it is not.”\r\n\r\n“Now, I have something to tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Is it about politics?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Because in that case I could not listen to you.”\r\n\r\n“Look here: whilst you were playing actors and audience by yourself,\r\nsome one knocked at the door of the tavern.”\r\n\r\n“Some one knocked at the door?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like that.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I, either.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“And then I opened it.”\r\n\r\n“Who was it that knocked?”\r\n\r\n“Some one who spoke to me.”\r\n\r\n“What did he say?”\r\n\r\n“I listened to him.”\r\n\r\n“What did you answer?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing. I came back to see you play.”\r\n\r\n“And--?”\r\n\r\n“Some one knocked a second time.”\r\n\r\n“Who? the same person?”\r\n\r\n“No, another.”\r\n\r\n“Some one else to speak to you?”\r\n\r\n“Some one who said nothing.”\r\n\r\n“I like that better.”\r\n\r\n“I do not.”\r\n\r\n“Explain yourself, Master Nicless.”\r\n\r\n“Guess who called the first time.”\r\n\r\n“I have no leisure to be an Oedipus.”\r\n\r\n“It was the proprietor of the circus.”\r\n\r\n“Over the way?”\r\n\r\n“Over the way.”\r\n\r\n“Whence comes all that fearful noise. Well?”\r\n\r\n“Well, Master Ursus, he makes you a proposal.”\r\n\r\n“A proposal?”\r\n\r\n“A proposal.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because--”\r\n\r\n“You have an advantage over me, Master Nicless. Just now you solved my\r\nenigma, and now I cannot understand yours.”\r\n\r\n“The proprietor of the circus commissioned me to tell you that he had\r\nseen the _cortège_ of police pass this morning, and that he, the\r\nproprietor of the circus, wishing to prove that he is your friend,\r\noffers to buy of you, for fifty pounds, ready money, your caravan, the\r\nGreen Box, your two horses, your trumpets, with the women that blow\r\nthem, your play, with the blind girl who sings in it, your wolf, and\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\nUrsus smiled a haughty smile.\r\n\r\n“Innkeeper, tell the proprietor of the circus that Gwynplaine is coming\r\nback.”\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper took something from a chair in the darkness, and turning\r\ntowards Ursus with both arms raised, dangled from one hand a cloak, and\r\nfrom the other a leather esclavine, a felt hat, and a jacket.\r\n\r\nAnd Master Nicless said, “The man who knocked the second time was\r\nconnected with the police; he came in and left without saying a word,\r\nand brought these things.”\r\n\r\nUrsus recognized the esclavine, the jacket, the hat, and the cloak of\r\nGwynplaine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMOENIBUS SURDIS CAMPANA MUTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nUrsus smoothed the felt of the hat, touched the cloth of the cloak, the\r\nserge of the coat, the leather of the esclavine, and no longer able to\r\ndoubt whose garments they were, with a gesture at once brief and\r\nimperative, and without saying a word, pointed to the door of the inn.\r\n\r\nMaster Nicless opened it.\r\n\r\nUrsus rushed out of the tavern.\r\n\r\nMaster Nicless looked after him, and saw Ursus run, as fast as his old\r\nlegs would allow, in the direction taken that morning by the wapentake\r\nwho carried off Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour afterwards, Ursus, out of breath, reached the\r\nlittle street in which stood the back wicket of the Southwark jail,\r\nwhich he had already watched so many hours. This alley was lonely enough\r\nat all hours; but if dreary during the day, it was portentous in the\r\nnight. No one ventured through it after a certain hour. It seemed as\r\nthough people feared that the walls should close in, and that if the\r\nprison or the cemetery took a fancy to embrace, they should be crushed\r\nin their clasp. Such are the effects of darkness. The pollard willows of\r\nthe Ruelle Vauvert in Paris were thus ill-famed. It was said that\r\nduring the night the stumps of those trees changed into great hands, and\r\ncaught hold of the passers-by.\r\n\r\nBy instinct the Southwark folks shunned, as we have already mentioned,\r\nthis alley between a prison and a churchyard. Formerly it had been\r\nbarricaded during the night by an iron chain. Very uselessly; because\r\nthe strongest chain which guarded the street was the terror it inspired.\r\n\r\nUrsus entered it resolutely.\r\n\r\nWhat intention possessed him? None.\r\n\r\nHe came into the alley to seek intelligence.\r\n\r\nWas he going to knock at the gate of the jail? Certainly not. Such an\r\nexpedient, at once fearful and vain, had no place in his brain. To\r\nattempt to introduce himself to demand an explanation. What folly!\r\nPrisons do not open to those who wish to enter, any more than to those\r\nwho desire to get out. Their hinges never turn except by law. Ursus knew\r\nthis. Why, then, had he come there? To see. To see what? Nothing. Who\r\ncan tell? Even to be opposite the gate through which Gwynplaine had\r\ndisappeared was something.\r\n\r\nSometimes the blackest and most rugged of walls whispers, and some light\r\nescapes through a cranny. A vague glimmering is now and then to be\r\nperceived through solid and sombre piles of building. Even to examine\r\nthe envelope of a fact may be to some purpose. The instinct of us all is\r\nto leave between the fact which interests us and ourselves but the\r\nthinnest possible cover. Therefore it was that Ursus returned to the\r\nalley in which the lower entrance to the prison was situated.\r\n\r\nJust as he entered it he heard one stroke of the clock, then a second.\r\n\r\n“Hold,” thought he; “can it be midnight already?”\r\n\r\nMechanically he set himself to count.\r\n\r\n“Three, four, five.”\r\n\r\nHe mused.\r\n\r\n“At what long intervals this clock strikes! how slowly! Six; seven!”\r\n\r\nThen he remarked,--\r\n\r\n“What a melancholy sound! Eight, nine! Ah! nothing can be more natural;\r\nit’s dull work for a clock to live in a prison. Ten! Besides, there is\r\nthe cemetery. This clock sounds the hour to the living, and eternity to\r\nthe dead. Eleven! Alas! to strike the hour to him who is not free is\r\nalso to chronicle an eternity. Twelve!”\r\n\r\nHe paused.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is midnight.”\r\n\r\nThe clock struck a thirteenth stroke.\r\n\r\nUrsus shuddered.\r\n\r\n“Thirteen!”\r\n\r\nThen followed a fourteenth; then a fifteenth.\r\n\r\n“What can this mean?”\r\n\r\nThe strokes continued at long intervals. Ursus listened.\r\n\r\n“It is not the striking of a clock; it is the bell Muta. No wonder I\r\nsaid, ‘How long it takes to strike midnight!’ This clock does not\r\nstrike; it tolls. What fearful thing is about to take place?”\r\n\r\nFormerly all prisons and all monasteries had a bell called Muta,\r\nreserved for melancholy occasions. La Muta (the mute) was a bell which\r\nstruck very low, as if doing its best not to be heard.\r\n\r\nUrsus had reached the corner which he had found so convenient for his\r\nwatch, and whence he had been able, during a great part of the day, to\r\nkeep his eye on the prison.\r\n\r\nThe strokes followed each other at lugubrious intervals.\r\n\r\nA knell makes an ugly punctuation in space. It breaks the preoccupation\r\nof the mind into funereal paragraphs. A knell, like a man’s\r\ndeath-rattle, notifies an agony. If in the houses about the\r\nneighbourhood where a knell is tolled there are reveries straying in\r\ndoubt, its sound cuts them into rigid fragments. A vague reverie is a\r\nsort of refuge. Some indefinable diffuseness in anguish allows now and\r\nthen a ray of hope to pierce through it. A knell is precise and\r\ndesolating. It concentrates this diffusion of thought, and precipitates\r\nthe vapours in which anxiety seeks to remain in suspense. A knell speaks\r\nto each one in the sense of his own grief or of his own fear. Tragic\r\nbell! it concerns you. It is a warning to you.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing so dreary as a monologue on which its cadence falls.\r\nThe even returns of sound seem to show a purpose.\r\n\r\nWhat is it that this hammer, the bell, forges on the anvil of thought?\r\n\r\nUrsus counted, vaguely and without motive, the tolling of the knell.\r\nFeeling that his thoughts were sliding from him, he made an effort not\r\nto let them slip into conjecture. Conjecture is an inclined plane, on\r\nwhich we slip too far to be to our own advantage. Still, what was the\r\nmeaning of the bell?\r\n\r\nHe looked through the darkness in the direction in which he knew the\r\ngate of the prison to be.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in that very spot which looked like a dark hole, a redness\r\nshowed. The redness grew larger, and became a light.\r\n\r\nThere was no uncertainty about it. It soon took a form and angles. The\r\ngate of the jail had just turned on its hinges. The glow painted the\r\narch and the jambs of the door. It was a yawning rather than an opening.\r\nA prison does not open; it yawns--perhaps from ennui. Through the gate\r\npassed a man with a torch in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe bell rang on. Ursus felt his attention fascinated by two objects. He\r\nwatched--his ear the knell, his eye the torch. Behind the first man the\r\ngate, which had been ajar, enlarged the opening suddenly, and allowed\r\negress to two other men; then to a fourth. This fourth was the\r\nwapentake, clearly visible in the light of the torch. In his grasp was\r\nhis iron staff.\r\n\r\nFollowing the wapentake, there filed and opened out below the gateway in\r\norder, two by two, with the rigidity of a series of walking posts, ranks\r\nof silent men.\r\n\r\nThis nocturnal procession stepped through the wicket in file, like a\r\nprocession of penitents, without any solution of continuity, with a\r\nfunereal care to make no noise--gravely, almost gently. A serpent issues\r\nfrom its hole with similar precautions.\r\n\r\nThe torch threw out their profiles and attitudes into relief. Fierce\r\nlooks, sullen attitudes.\r\n\r\nUrsus recognized the faces of the police who had that morning carried\r\noff Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about it. They were the same. They were reappearing.\r\n\r\nOf course, Gwynplaine would also reappear. They had led him to that\r\nplace; they would bring him back.\r\n\r\nIt was all quite clear.\r\n\r\nUrsus strained his eyes to the utmost. Would they set Gwynplaine at\r\nliberty?\r\n\r\nThe files of police flowed from the low arch very slowly, and, as it\r\nwere, drop by drop. The toll of the bell was uninterrupted, and seemed\r\nto mark their steps. On leaving the prison, the procession turned their\r\nbacks on Ursus, went to the right, into the bend of the street opposite\r\nto that in which he was posted.\r\n\r\nA second torch shone under the gateway, announcing the end of the\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\nUrsus was now about to see what they were bringing with them. The\r\nprisoner--the man.\r\n\r\nUrsus was soon, he thought, to see Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nThat which they carried appeared.\r\n\r\nIt was a bier.\r\n\r\nFour men carried a bier, covered with black cloth.\r\n\r\nBehind them came a man, with a shovel on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nA third lighted torch, held by a man reading a book, probably the\r\nchaplain, closed the procession.\r\n\r\nThe bier followed the ranks of the police, who had turned to the right.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment the head of the procession stopped.\r\n\r\nUrsus heard the grating of a key.\r\n\r\nOpposite the prison, in the low wall which ran along the other side of\r\nthe street, another opening was illuminated by a torch passing beneath\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis gate, over which a death’s-head was placed, was that of the\r\ncemetery.\r\n\r\nThe wapentake passed through it, then the men, then the second torch.\r\nThe procession decreased therein, like a reptile entering his retreat.\r\n\r\nThe files of police penetrated into that other darkness which was beyond\r\nthe gate; then the bier; then the man with the spade; then the chaplain\r\nwith his torch and his book, and the gate closed.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing left but a haze of light above the wall.\r\n\r\nA muttering was heard; then some dull sounds. Doubtless the chaplain and\r\nthe gravedigger--the one throwing on the coffin some verses of\r\nScripture, the other some clods of earth.\r\n\r\nThe muttering ceased; the heavy sounds ceased. A movement was made. The\r\ntorches shone. The wapentake reappeared, holding high his weapon, under\r\nthe reopened gate of the cemetery; then the chaplain with his book, and\r\nthe gravedigger with his spade. The _cortège_ reappeared without the\r\ncoffin.\r\n\r\nThe files of men crossed over in the same order, with the same\r\ntaciturnity, and in the opposite direction. The gate of the cemetery\r\nclosed. That of the prison opened. Its sepulchral architecture stood out\r\nagainst the light. The obscurity of the passage became vaguely visible.\r\nThe solid and deep night of the jail was revealed to sight; then the\r\nwhole vision disappeared in the depths of shadow.\r\n\r\nThe knell ceased. All was locked in silence. A sinister incarceration of\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\nA vanished vision; nothing more.\r\n\r\nA passage of spectres, which had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe logical arrangement of surmises builds up something which at least\r\nresembles evidence. To the arrest of Gwynplaine, to the secret mode of\r\nhis capture, to the return of his garments by the police officer, to the\r\ndeath bell of the prison to which he had been conducted, was now added,\r\nor rather adjusted--portentous circumstance--a coffin carried to the\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n“He is dead!” cried Ursus.\r\n\r\nHe sank down upon a stone.\r\n\r\n“Dead! They have killed him! Gwynplaine! My child! My son!”\r\n\r\nAnd he burst into passionate sobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSTATE POLICY DEALS WITH LITTLE MATTERS AS WELL AS WITH GREAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nUrsus, alas! had boasted that he had never wept. His reservoir of tears\r\nwas full. Such plentitude as is accumulated drop on drop, sorrow on\r\nsorrow, through a long existence, is not to be poured out in a moment.\r\nUrsus wept alone.\r\n\r\nThe first tear is a letting out of waters. He wept for Gwynplaine, for\r\nDea, for himself, Ursus, for Homo. He wept like a child. He wept like an\r\nold man. He wept for everything at which he had ever laughed. He paid\r\noff arrears. Man is never nonsuited when he pleads his right to tears.\r\n\r\nThe corpse they had just buried was Hardquanonne’s; but Ursus could not\r\nknow that.\r\n\r\nThe hours crept on.\r\n\r\nDay began to break. The pale clothing of the morning was spread out,\r\ndimly creased with shadow, over the bowling-green. The dawn lighted up\r\nthe front of the Tadcaster Inn. Master Nicless had not gone to bed,\r\nbecause sometimes the same occurrence produces sleeplessness in many.\r\n\r\nTroubles radiate in every direction. Throw a stone in the water, and\r\ncount the splashes.\r\n\r\nMaster Nicless felt himself impeached. It is very disagreeable that such\r\nthings should happen in one’s house. Master Nicless, uneasy, and\r\nforeseeing misfortunes, meditated. He regretted having received such\r\npeople into his house. Had he but known that they would end by getting\r\nhim into mischief! But the question was how to get rid of them? He had\r\ngiven Ursus a lease. What a blessing if he could free himself from it!\r\nHow should he set to work to drive them out?\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door of the inn resounded with one of those tumultuous\r\nknocks which in England announces “Somebody.” The gamut of knocking\r\ncorresponds with the ladder of hierarchy.\r\n\r\nIt was not quite the knock of a lord; but it was the knock of a justice.\r\n\r\nThe trembling innkeeper half opened his window. There was, indeed, the\r\nmagistrate. Master Nicless perceived at the door a body of police, from\r\nthe head of which two men detached themselves, one of whom was the\r\njustice of the quorum.\r\n\r\nMaster Nicless had seen the justice of the quorum that morning, and\r\nrecognized him.\r\n\r\nHe did not know the other, who was a fat gentleman, with a\r\nwaxen-coloured face, a fashionable wig, and a travelling cloak. Nicless\r\nwas much afraid of the first of these persons, the justice of the\r\nquorum. Had he been of the court, he would have feared the other most,\r\nbecause it was Barkilphedro.\r\n\r\nOne of the subordinates knocked at the door again violently.\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper, with great drops of perspiration on his brow, from\r\nanxiety, opened it.\r\n\r\nThe justice of the quorum, in the tone of a man who is employed in\r\nmatters of police, and who is well acquainted with various shades of\r\nvagrancy, raised his voice, and asked, severely, for\r\n\r\n“Master Ursus!”\r\n\r\nThe host, cap in hand, replied,--\r\n\r\n“Your honour; he lives here.”\r\n\r\n“I know it,” said the justice.\r\n\r\n“No doubt, your honour.”\r\n\r\n“Tell him to come down.”\r\n\r\n“Your honour, he is not here.”\r\n\r\n“Where is he?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“How is that?”\r\n\r\n“He has not come in.”\r\n\r\n“Then he must have gone out very early?”\r\n\r\n“No; but he went out very late.”\r\n\r\n“What vagabonds!” replied the justice.\r\n\r\n“Your honour,” said Master Nicless, softly, “here he comes.”\r\n\r\nUrsus, indeed, had just come in sight, round a turn of the wall. He was\r\nreturning to the inn. He had passed nearly the whole night between the\r\njail, where at midday he had seen Gwynplaine, and the cemetery, where at\r\nmidnight he had heard the grave filled up. He was pallid with two\r\npallors--that of sorrow and of twilight.\r\n\r\nDawn, which is light in a chrysalis state, leaves even those forms which\r\nare in movement in the uncertainty of night. Ursus, wan and indistinct,\r\nwalked slowly, like a man in a dream. In the wild distraction produced\r\nby agony of mind, he had left the inn with his head bare. He had not\r\neven found out that he had no hat on. His spare, gray locks fluttered in\r\nthe wind. His open eyes appeared sightless. Often when awake we are\r\nasleep, and as often when asleep we are awake.\r\n\r\nUrsus looked like a lunatic.\r\n\r\n“Master Ursus,” cried the innkeeper, “come; their honours desire to\r\nspeak to you.”\r\n\r\nMaster Nicless, in his endeavour to soften matters down, let slip,\r\nalthough he would gladly have omitted, this plural, “their\r\nhonours”--respectful to the group, but mortifying, perhaps, to the\r\nchief, confounded therein, to some degree, with his subordinates.\r\n\r\nUrsus started like a man falling off a bed, on which he was sound\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” said he.\r\n\r\nHe saw the police, and at the head of the police the justice. A fresh\r\nand rude shock.\r\n\r\nBut a short time ago, the wapentake, now the justice of the quorum. He\r\nseemed to have been cast from one to the other, as ships by some reefs\r\nof which we have read in old stories.\r\n\r\nThe justice of the quorum made him a sign to enter the tavern. Ursus\r\nobeyed.\r\n\r\nGovicum, who had just got up, and who was sweeping the room, stopped his\r\nwork, got into a corner behind the tables, put down his broom, and held\r\nhis breath. He plunged his fingers into his hair, and scratched his\r\nhead, a symptom which indicated attention to what was about to occur.\r\n\r\nThe justice of the quorum sat down on a form, before a table.\r\nBarkilphedro took a chair. Ursus and Master Nicless remained standing.\r\nThe police officers, left outside, grouped themselves in front of the\r\nclosed door.\r\n\r\nThe justice of the quorum fixed his eye, full of the law, upon Ursus. He\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n“You have a wolf.”\r\n\r\nUrsus answered,--\r\n\r\n“Not exactly.”\r\n\r\n“You have a wolf,” continued the justice, emphasizing “wolf” with a\r\ndecided accent.\r\n\r\nUrsus answered,--\r\n\r\n“You see--”\r\n\r\nAnd he was silent.\r\n\r\n“A misdemeanour!” replied the justice.\r\n\r\nUrsus hazarded an excuse,--\r\n\r\n“He is my servant.”\r\n\r\nThe justice placed his hand flat on the table, with his fingers spread\r\nout, which is a very fine gesture of authority.\r\n\r\n“Merry-andrew! to-morrow, by this hour, you and your wolf must have left\r\nEngland. If not, the wolf will be seized, carried to the register\r\noffice, and killed.”\r\n\r\nUrsus thought, “More murder!” but he breathed not a syllable, and was\r\nsatisfied with trembling in every limb.\r\n\r\n“You hear?” said the justice.\r\n\r\nUrsus nodded.\r\n\r\nThe justice persisted,--\r\n\r\n“Killed.”\r\n\r\nThere was silence.\r\n\r\n“Strangled, or drowned.”\r\n\r\nThe justice of the quorum watched Ursus.\r\n\r\n“And yourself in prison.”\r\n\r\nUrsus murmured,--\r\n\r\n“Your worship!”\r\n\r\n“Be off before to-morrow morning; if not, such is the order.”\r\n\r\n“Your worship!”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Must we leave England, he and I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“To-day?”\r\n\r\n“To-day.”\r\n\r\n“What is to be done?”\r\n\r\nMaster Nicless was happy. The magistrate, whom he had feared, had come\r\nto his aid. The police had acted as auxiliary to him, Nicless. They had\r\ndelivered him from “such people.” The means he had sought were brought\r\nto him. Ursus, whom he wanted to get rid of, was being driven away by\r\nthe police, a superior authority. Nothing to object to. He was\r\ndelighted. He interrupted,--\r\n\r\n“Your honour, that man--”\r\n\r\nHe pointed to Ursus with his finger.\r\n\r\n“That man wants to know how he is to leave England to-day. Nothing can\r\nbe easier. There are night and day at anchor on the Thames, both on this\r\nand on the other side of London Bridge, vessels that sail to the\r\nContinent. They go from England to Denmark, to Holland, to Spain; not to\r\nFrance, on account of the war, but everywhere else. To-night several\r\nships will sail, about one o’clock in the morning, which is the hour of\r\nhigh tide, and, amongst others, the _Vograat_ of Rotterdam.”\r\n\r\nThe justice of the quorum made a movement of his shoulder towards Ursus.\r\n\r\n“Be it so. Leave by the first ship--by the _Vograat_.”\r\n\r\n“Your worship,” said Ursus.\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Your worship, if I had, as formerly, only my little box on wheels, it\r\nmight be done. A boat would contain that; but--”\r\n\r\n“But what?”\r\n\r\n“But now I have got the Green Box, which is a great caravan drawn by two\r\nhorses, and however wide the ship might be, we could not get it into\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“What is that to me?” said the justice. “The wolf will be killed.”\r\n\r\nUrsus shuddered, as if he were grasped by a hand of ice.\r\n\r\n“Monsters!” he thought. “Murdering people is their way of settling\r\nmatters.”\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper smiled, and addressed Ursus.\r\n\r\n“Master Ursus, you can sell the Green Box.”\r\n\r\nUrsus looked at Nicless.\r\n\r\n“Master Ursus, you have the offer.”\r\n\r\n“From whom?”\r\n\r\n“An offer for the caravan, an offer for the two horses, an offer for the\r\ntwo gipsy women, an offer--”\r\n\r\n“From whom?” repeated Ursus.\r\n\r\n“From the proprietor of the neighbouring circus.”\r\n\r\nUrsus remembered it.\r\n\r\n“It is true.”\r\n\r\nMaster Nicless turned to the justice of the quorum.\r\n\r\n“Your honour, the bargain can be completed to-day. The proprietor of the\r\ncircus close by wishes to buy the caravan and the horses.”\r\n\r\n“The proprietor of the circus is right,” said the justice, “because he\r\nwill soon require them. A caravan and horses will be useful to him. He,\r\ntoo, will depart to-day. The reverend gentlemen of the parish of\r\nSouthwark have complained of the indecent riot in Tarrinzeau field. The\r\nsheriff has taken his measures. To-night there will not be a single\r\njuggler’s booth in the place. There must be an end of all these\r\nscandals. The honourable gentleman who deigns to be here present--”\r\n\r\nThe justice of the quorum interrupted his speech to salute Barkilphedro,\r\nwho returned the bow.\r\n\r\n“The honourable gentleman who deigns to be present has just arrived from\r\nWindsor. He brings orders. Her Majesty has said, ‘It must be swept\r\naway.’”\r\n\r\nUrsus, during his long meditation all night, had not failed to put\r\nhimself some questions. After all, he had only seen a bier. Could he be\r\nsure that it contained Gwynplaine? Other people might have died besides\r\nGwynplaine. A coffin does not announce the name of the corpse, as it\r\npasses by. A funeral had followed the arrest of Gwynplaine. That proved\r\nnothing. _Post hoc, non propter hoc, etc_. Ursus had begun to doubt.\r\n\r\nHope burns and glimmers over misery like naphtha over water. Its\r\nhovering flame ever floats over human sorrow. Ursus had come to this\r\nconclusion, “It is probable that it was Gwynplaine whom they buried, but\r\nit is not certain. Who knows? Perhaps Gwynplaine is still alive.”\r\n\r\nUrsus bowed to the justice.\r\n\r\n“Honourable judge, I will go away, we will go away, all will go away, by\r\nthe _Vograat_ of Rotterdam, to-day. I will sell the Green Box, the\r\nhorses, the trumpets, the gipsies. But I have a comrade, whom I cannot\r\nleave behind--Gwynplaine.”\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine is dead,” said a voice.\r\n\r\nUrsus felt a cold sensation, such as is produced by a reptile crawling\r\nover the skin. It was Barkilphedro who had just spoken.\r\n\r\nThe last gleam was extinguished. No more doubt now. Gwynplaine was dead.\r\nA person in authority must know. This one looked ill-favoured enough to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nUrsus bowed to him.\r\n\r\nMaster Nicless was a good-hearted man enough, but a dreadful coward.\r\nOnce terrified, he became a brute. The greatest cruelty is that inspired\r\nby fear.\r\n\r\nHe growled out,--\r\n\r\n“This simplifies matters.”\r\n\r\nAnd he indulged, standing behind Ursus, in rubbing his hands, a\r\npeculiarity of the selfish, signifying, “I am well out of it,” and\r\nsuggestive of Pontius Pilate washing his hands.\r\n\r\nUrsus, overwhelmed, bent down his head.\r\n\r\nThe sentence on Gwynplaine had been executed--death. His sentence was\r\npronounced--exile. Nothing remained but to obey. He felt as in a dream.\r\n\r\nSome one touched his arm. It was the other person, who was with the\r\njustice of the quorum. Ursus shuddered.\r\n\r\nThe voice which had said, “Gwynplaine is dead,” whispered in his ear,--\r\n\r\n“Here are ten guineas, sent you by one who wishes you well.”\r\n\r\nAnd Barkilphedro placed a little purse on a table before Ursus. We must\r\nnot forget the casket that Barkilphedro had taken with him.\r\n\r\nTen guineas out of two thousand! It was all that Barkilphedro could make\r\nup his mind to part with. In all conscience it was enough. If he had\r\ngiven more, he would have lost. He had taken the trouble of finding out\r\na lord; and having sunk the shaft, it was but fair that the first\r\nproceeds of the mine should belong to him. Those who see meanness in the\r\nact are right, but they would be wrong to feel astonished. Barkilphedro\r\nloved money, especially money which was stolen. An envious man is an\r\navaricious one. Barkilphedro was not without his faults. The commission\r\nof crimes does not preclude the possession of vices. Tigers have their\r\nlice.\r\n\r\nBesides, he belonged to the school of Bacon.\r\n\r\nBarkilphedro turned towards the justice of the quorum, and said to\r\nhim,--\r\n\r\n“Sir, be so good as to conclude this matter. I am in haste. A carriage\r\nand horses belonging to her Majesty await me. I must go full gallop to\r\nWindsor, for I must be there within two hours’ time. I have intelligence\r\nto give, and orders to take.”\r\n\r\nThe justice of the quorum arose.\r\n\r\nHe went to the door, which was only latched, opened it, and, looking\r\nsilently towards the police, beckoned to them authoritatively. They\r\nentered with that silence which heralds severity of action.\r\n\r\nMaster Nicless, satisfied with the rapid _dénouement_ which cut short\r\nhis difficulties, charmed to be out of the entangled skein, was afraid,\r\nwhen he saw the muster of officers, that they were going to apprehend\r\nUrsus in his house. Two arrests, one after the other, made in his\r\nhouse--first that of Gwynplaine, then that of Ursus--might be injurious\r\nto the inn. Customers dislike police raids.\r\n\r\nHere then was a time for a respectful appeal, suppliant and generous.\r\nMaster Nicless turned toward the justice of the quorum a smiling face,\r\nin which confidence was tempered by respect.\r\n\r\n“Your honour, I venture to observe to your honour that these honourable\r\ngentlemen, the police officers, might be dispensed with, now that the\r\nwolf is about to be carried away from England, and that this man, Ursus,\r\nmakes no resistance; and since your honour’s orders are being punctually\r\ncarried out, your honour will consider that the respectable business of\r\nthe police, so necessary to the good of the kingdom, does great harm to\r\nan establishment, and that my house is innocent. The merry-andrews of\r\nthe Green Box having been swept away, as her Majesty says, there is no\r\nlonger any criminal here, as I do not suppose that the blind girl and\r\nthe two women are criminals; therefore, I implore your honour to deign\r\nto shorten your august visit, and to dismiss these worthy gentlemen who\r\nhave just entered, because there is nothing for them to do in my house;\r\nand, if your honour will permit me to prove the justice of my speech\r\nunder the form of a humble question, I will prove the inutility of these\r\nrevered gentlemen’s presence by asking your honour, if the man, Ursus,\r\nobeys orders and departs, who there can be to arrest here?”\r\n\r\n“Yourself,” said the justice.\r\n\r\nA man does not argue with a sword which runs him through and through.\r\nMaster Nicless subsided--he cared not on what, on a table, on a form, on\r\nanything that happened to be there--prostrate.\r\n\r\nThe justice raised his voice, so that if there were people outside, they\r\nmight hear.\r\n\r\n“Master Nicless Plumptree, keeper of this tavern, this is the last point\r\nto be settled. This mountebank and the wolf are vagabonds. They are\r\ndriven away. But the person most in fault is yourself. It is in your\r\nhouse, and with your consent, that the law has been violated; and you, a\r\nman licensed, invested with a public responsibility, have established\r\nthe scandal here. Master Nicless, your licence is taken away; you must\r\npay the penalty, and go to prison.”\r\n\r\nThe policemen surrounded the innkeeper.\r\n\r\nThe justice continued, pointing out Govicum,--\r\n\r\n“Arrest that boy as an accomplice.” The hand of an officer fell upon the\r\ncollar of Govicum, who looked at him inquisitively. The boy was not much\r\nalarmed, scarcely understanding the occurrence; having already observed\r\nmany things out of the way, he wondered if this were the end of the\r\ncomedy.\r\n\r\nThe justice of the quorum forced his hat down on his head, crossed his\r\nhands on his stomach, which is the height of majesty, and added,--\r\n\r\n“It is decided, Master Nicless; you are to be taken to prison, and put\r\ninto jail, you and the boy; and this house, the Tadcaster Inn, is to\r\nremain shut up, condemned and closed. For the sake of example. Upon\r\nwhich, you will follow us.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE SEVENTH.\r\n\r\n_THE TITANESS._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE AWAKENING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Dea!\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Gwynplaine, as he watched the break of day at Corleone\r\nLodge, while the things we have related were occurring at the Tadcaster\r\nInn, that the call came from without; but it came from within.\r\n\r\nWho has not heard the deep clamours of the soul?\r\n\r\nMoreover, the morning was dawning.\r\n\r\nAurora is a voice.\r\n\r\nOf what use is the sun if not to reawaken that dark sleeper--the\r\nconscience?\r\n\r\nLight and virtue are akin.\r\n\r\nWhether the god be called Christ or Love, there is at times an hour when\r\nhe is forgotten, even by the best. All of us, even the saints, require a\r\nvoice to remind us; and the dawn speaks to us, like a sublime monitor.\r\nConscience calls out before duty, as the cock crows before the dawn of\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThat chaos, the human heart, hears the _fiat lux_!\r\n\r\nGwynplaine--we will continue thus to call him (Clancharlie is a lord,\r\nGwynplaine is a man)--Gwynplaine felt as if brought back to life. It was\r\ntime that the artery was bound up.\r\n\r\nFor a while his virtue had spread its wings and flown away.\r\n\r\n“And Dea!” he said.\r\n\r\nThen he felt through his veins a generous transfusion. Something\r\nhealthy and tumultuous rushed upon him. The violent irruption of good\r\nthoughts is like the return home of a man who has not his key, and who\r\nforces his own look honestly. It is an escalade, but an escalade of\r\ngood. It is a burglary, but a burglary of evil.\r\n\r\n“Dea! Dea! Dea!” repeated he.\r\n\r\nHe strove to assure himself of his heart’s strength. And he put the\r\nquestion with a loud voice--“Where are you?”\r\n\r\nHe almost wondered that no one answered him.\r\n\r\nThen again, gazing on the walls and the ceiling, with wandering\r\nthoughts, through which reason returned.\r\n\r\n“Where are you? Where am I?”\r\n\r\nAnd in the chamber which was his cage he began to walk again, to and\r\nfro, like a wild beast in captivity.\r\n\r\n“Where am I? At Windsor. And you? In Southwark. Alas! this is the first\r\ntime that there has been distance between us. Who has dug this gulf? I\r\nhere, thou there. Oh, it cannot be; it shall not be! What is this that\r\nthey have done to me?”\r\n\r\nHe stopped.\r\n\r\n“Who talked to me of the queen? What do I know of such things? _I_\r\nchanged! Why? Because I am a lord. Do you know what has happened, Dea?\r\nYou are a lady. What has come to pass is astounding. My business now is\r\nto get back into my right road. Who is it who led me astray? There is a\r\nman who spoke to me mysteriously. I remember the words which he\r\naddressed to me. ‘My lord, when one door opens another is shut. That\r\nwhich you have left behind is no longer yours.’ In other words, you are\r\na coward. That man, the miserable wretch! said that to me before I was\r\nwell awake. He took advantage of my first moment of astonishment. I was\r\nas it were a prey to him. Where is he, that I may insult him? He spoke\r\nto me with the evil smile of a demon. But see--I am myself again. That\r\nis well. They deceive themselves if they think that they can do what\r\nthey like with Lord Clancharlie, a peer of England. Yes, with a peeress,\r\nwho is Dea! Conditions! Shall I accept them? The queen! What is the\r\nqueen to me? I never saw her. I am not a lord to be made a slave. I\r\nenter my position unfettered. Did they think they had unchained me for\r\nnothing? They have unmuzzled me. That is all. Dea! Ursus! we are\r\ntogether. That which you were, I was; that which I am, you are. Come.\r\nNo. I will go to you directly--directly. I have already waited too long.\r\nWhat can they think, not seeing me return! That money. When I think I\r\nsent them that money! It was myself that they wanted. I remember the man\r\nsaid that I could not leave this place. We shall see that. Come! a\r\ncarriage, a carriage! put to the horses. I am going to look for them.\r\nWhere are the servants? I ought to have servants here, since I am a\r\nlord. I am master here. This is my house. I will twist off the bolts, I\r\nwill break the locks, I will kick down the doors, I will run my sword\r\nthrough the body of any one who bars my passage. I should like to see\r\nwho shall stop me. I have a wife, and she is Dea. I have a father, who\r\nis Ursus. My house is a palace, and I give it to Ursus. My name is a\r\ndiadem, and I give it to Dea. Quick, directly, Dea, I am coming; yes,\r\nyou may be sure that I shall soon stride across the intervening space!”\r\n\r\nAnd raising the first piece of tapestry he came to, he rushed from the\r\nchamber impetuously.\r\n\r\nHe found himself in a corridor.\r\n\r\nHe went straight forward.\r\n\r\nA second corridor opened out before him.\r\n\r\nAll the doors were open.\r\n\r\nHe walked on at random, from chamber to chamber, from passage to\r\npassage, seeking an exit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE RESEMBLANCE OF A PALACE TO A WOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn palaces after the Italian fashion, and Corleone Lodge was one, there\r\nwere very few doors, but abundance of tapestry screens and curtained\r\ndoorways. In every palace of that date there was a wonderful labyrinth\r\nof chambers and corridors, where luxury ran riot; gilding, marble,\r\ncarved wainscoting, Eastern silks; nooks and corners, some secret and\r\ndark as night, others light and pleasant as the day. There were attics,\r\nrichly and brightly furnished; burnished recesses shining with Dutch\r\ntiles and Portuguese azulejos. The tops of the high windows were\r\nconverted into small rooms and glass attics, forming pretty habitable\r\nlanterns. The thickness of the walls was such that there were rooms\r\nwithin them. Here and there were closets, nominally wardrobes. They were\r\ncalled “The Little Rooms.” It was within them that evil deeds were\r\nhatched.\r\n\r\nWhen a Duke of Guise had to be killed, the pretty Présidente of\r\nSylvecane abducted, or the cries of little girls brought thither by\r\nLebel smothered, such places were convenient for the purpose. They were\r\nlabyrinthine chambers, impracticable to a stranger; scenes of\r\nabductions; unknown depths, receptacles of mysterious disappearances. In\r\nthose elegant caverns princes and lords stored their plunder. In such a\r\nplace the Count de Charolais hid Madame Courchamp, the wife of the Clerk\r\nof the Privy Council; Monsieur de Monthulé, the daughter of Haudry, the\r\nfarmer of La Croix Saint Lenfroy; the Prince de Conti, the two beautiful\r\nbaker women of L’Ile Adam; the Duke of Buckingham, poor Pennywell, etc.\r\nThe deeds done there were such as were designated by the Roman law as\r\ncommitted _vi, clam, et precario_--by force, in secret, and for a short\r\ntime. Once in, an occupant remained there till the master of the house\r\ndecreed his or her release. They were gilded oubliettes, savouring both\r\nof the cloister and the harem. Their staircases twisted, turned,\r\nascended, and descended. A zigzag of rooms, one running into another,\r\nled back to the starting-point. A gallery terminated in an oratory. A\r\nconfessional was grafted on to an alcove. Perhaps the architects of “the\r\nlittle rooms,” building for royalty and aristocracy, took as models the\r\nramifications of coral beds, and the openings in a sponge. The branches\r\nbecame a labyrinth. Pictures turning on false panels were exits and\r\nentrances. They were full of stage contrivances, and no\r\nwonder--considering the dramas that were played there! The floors of\r\nthese hives reached from the cellars to the attics. Quaint madrepore\r\ninlaying every palace, from Versailles downwards, like cells of pygmies\r\nin dwelling-places of Titans. Passages, niches, alcoves, and secret\r\nrecesses. All sorts of holes and corners, in which was stored away the\r\nmeanness of the great.\r\n\r\nThese winding and narrow passages recalled games, blindfolded eyes,\r\nhands feeling in the dark, suppressed laughter, blind man’s buff, hide\r\nand seek, while, at the same time, they suggested memories of the\r\nAtrides, of the Plantagenets, of the Médicis, the brutal knights of\r\nEltz, of Rizzio, of Monaldeschi; of naked swords, pursuing the fugitive\r\nflying from room to room.\r\n\r\nThe ancients, too, had mysterious retreats of the same kind, in which\r\nluxury was adapted to enormities. The pattern has been preserved\r\nunderground in some sepulchres in Egypt, notably in the tomb of King\r\nPsammetichus, discovered by Passalacqua. The ancient poets have recorded\r\nthe horrors of these suspicious buildings. _Error circumflexus, locus\r\nimplicitus gyris_.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine was in the “little rooms” of Corleone Lodge. He was burning\r\nto be off, to get outside, to see Dea again. The maze of passages and\r\nalcoves, with secret and bewildering doors, checked and retarded his\r\nprogress. He strove to run; he was obliged to wander. He thought that he\r\nhad but one door to thrust open, while he had a skein of doors to\r\nunravel. To one room succeeded another. Then a crossway, with rooms on\r\nevery side.\r\n\r\nNot a living creature was to be seen. He listened. Not a sound.\r\n\r\nAt times he thought that he must be returning towards his\r\nstarting-point; then, that he saw some one approaching. It was no one.\r\nIt was only the reflection of himself in a mirror, dressed as a\r\nnobleman. _That_ he? Impossible! Then he recognized himself, but not at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nHe explored every passage that he came to.\r\n\r\nHe examined the quaint arrangements of the rambling building, and their\r\nyet quainter fittings. Here, a cabinet, painted and carved in a\r\nsentimental but vicious style; there, an equivocal-looking chapel,\r\nstudded with enamels and mother-of-pearl, with miniatures on ivory\r\nwrought out in relief, like those on old-fashioned snuff-boxes; there,\r\none of those pretty Florentine retreats, adapted to the hypochondriasis\r\nof women, and even then called _boudoirs_. Everywhere--on the ceilings,\r\non the walls, and on the very floors--were representations, in velvet or\r\nin metal, of birds, of trees; of luxuriant vegetation, picked out in\r\nreliefs of lacework; tables covered with jet carvings, representing\r\nwarriors, queens, and tritons armed with the scaly terminations of a\r\nhydra. Cut crystals combining prismatic effects with those of\r\nreflection. Mirrors repeated the light of precious stones, and sparkles\r\nglittered in the darkest corners. It was impossible to guess whether\r\nthose many-sided, shining surfaces, where emerald green mingled with\r\nthe golden hues of the rising sun where floated a glimmer of\r\never-varying colours, like those on a pigeon’s neck, were miniature\r\nmirrors or enormous beryls. Everywhere was magnificence, at once refined\r\nand stupendous; if it was not the most diminutive of palaces, it was the\r\nmost gigantic of jewel-cases. A house for Mab or a jewel for Geo.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine sought an exit. He could not find one. Impossible to make out\r\nhis way. There is nothing so confusing as wealth seen for the first\r\ntime. Moreover, this was a labyrinth. At each step he was stopped by\r\nsome magnificent object which appeared to retard his exit, and to be\r\nunwilling to let him pass. He was encompassed by a net of wonders. He\r\nfelt himself bound and held back.\r\n\r\nWhat a horrible palace! he thought. Restless, he wandered through the\r\nmaze, asking himself what it all meant--whether he was in prison;\r\nchafing, thirsting for the fresh air. He repeated Dea! Dea! as if that\r\nword was the thread of the labyrinth, and must be held unbroken, to\r\nguide him out of it. Now and then he shouted, “Ho! Any one there?” No\r\none answered. The rooms never came to an end. All was deserted, silent,\r\nsplendid, sinister. It realized the fables of enchanted castles. Hidden\r\npipes of hot air maintained a summer temperature in the building. It was\r\nas if some magician had caught up the month of June and imprisoned it in\r\na labyrinth. There were pleasant odours now and then, and he crossed\r\ncurrents of perfume, as though passing by invisible flowers. It was\r\nwarm. Carpets everywhere. One might have walked about there, unclothed.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine looked out of the windows. The view from each one was\r\ndifferent. From one he beheld gardens, sparkling with the freshness of a\r\nspring morning; from another a plot decked with statues; from a third, a\r\npatio in the Spanish style, a little square, flagged, mouldy, and cold.\r\nAt times he saw a river--it was the Thames; sometimes a great tower--it\r\nwas Windsor.\r\n\r\nIt was still so early that there were no signs of life without.\r\n\r\nHe stood still and listened.\r\n\r\n“Oh! I will get out of this place,” said he. “I will return to Dea! They\r\nshall not keep me here by force. Woe to him who bars my exit! What is\r\nthat great tower yonder? If there was a giant, a hell-hound, a minotaur,\r\nto keep the gate of this enchanted palace, I would annihilate him. If\r\nan army, I would exterminate it. Dea! Dea!”\r\n\r\nSuddenly he heard a gentle noise, very faint. It was like dropping\r\nwater. He was in a dark narrow passage, closed, some few paces further\r\non, by a curtain. He advanced to the curtain, pushed it aside, entered.\r\nHe leaped before he looked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn octagon room, with a vaulted ceiling, without windows but lighted by\r\na skylight; walls, ceiling, and floors faced with peach-coloured marble;\r\na black marble canopy, like a pall, with twisted columns in the solid\r\nbut pleasing Elizabethan style, overshadowing a vase-like bath of the\r\nsame black marble--this was what he saw before him. In the centre of the\r\nbath arose a slender jet of tepid and perfumed water, which, softly and\r\nslowly, was filling the tank. The bath was black to augment fairness\r\ninto brilliancy.\r\n\r\nIt was the water which he had heard. A waste-pipe, placed at a certain\r\nheight in the bath, prevented it from overflowing. Vapour was rising\r\nfrom the water, but not sufficient to cause it to hang in drops on the\r\nmarble. The slender jet of water was like a supple wand of steel,\r\nbending at the slightest current of air. There was no furniture, except\r\na chair-bed with pillows, long enough for a woman to lie on at full\r\nlength, and yet have room for a dog at her feet. The French, indeed,\r\nborrow their word _canapé_ from _can-al-pié_. This sofa was of Spanish\r\nmanufacture. In it silver took the place of woodwork. The cushions and\r\ncoverings were of rich white silk.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the bath, by the wall, was a lofty dressing-table\r\nof solid silver, furnished with every requisite for the table, having in\r\nits centre, and in imitation of a window, eight small Venetian mirrors,\r\nset in a silver frame. In a panel on the wall was a square opening, like\r\na little window, which was closed by a door of solid silver. This door\r\nwas fitted with hinges, like a shutter. On the shutter there glistened a\r\nchased and gilt royal crown. Over it, and affixed to the wall, was a\r\nbell, silver gilt, if not of pure gold.\r\n\r\nOpposite the entrance of the chamber, in which Gwynplaine stood as if\r\ntransfixed, there was an opening in the marble wall, extending to the\r\nceiling, and closed by a high and broad curtain of silver tissue. This\r\ncurtain, of fairy-like tenuity, was transparent, and did not interrupt\r\nthe view. Through the centre of this web, where one might expect a\r\nspider, Gwynplaine saw a more formidable object--a woman. Her dress was\r\na long chemise--so long that it floated over her feet, like the dresses\r\nof angels in holy pictures; but so fine that it seemed liquid.\r\n\r\nThe silver tissue, transparent as glass and fastened only at the\r\nceiling, could be lifted aside. It separated the marble chamber, which\r\nwas a bathroom, from the adjoining apartment, which was a bedchamber.\r\nThis tiny dormitory was as a grotto of mirrors. Venetian glasses, close\r\ntogether, mounted with gold mouldings, reflected on every side the bed\r\nin the centre of the room. On the bed, which, like the toilet-table, was\r\nof silver, lay the woman; she was asleep.\r\n\r\nThe crumpled clothes bore evidence of troubled sleep. The beauty of the\r\nfolds was proof of the quality of the material.\r\n\r\nIt was a period when a queen, thinking that she should be damned,\r\npictured hell to herself as a bed with coarse sheets.[20]\r\n\r\nA dressing-gown, of curious silk, was thrown over the foot of the couch.\r\nIt was apparently Chinese; for a great golden lizard was partly visible\r\nin between the folds.\r\n\r\nBeyond the couch, and probably masking a door, was a large mirror, on\r\nwhich were painted peacocks and swans.\r\n\r\nShadow seemed to lose its nature in this apartment, and glistened. The\r\nspaces between the mirrors and the gold work were lined with that\r\nsparkling material called at Venice thread of glass--that is, spun\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the couch stood a reading desk, on a movable pivot, with\r\ncandles, and a book lying open, bearing this title, in large red\r\nletters, “Alcoranus Mahumedis.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine saw none of these details. He had eyes only for the woman. He\r\nwas at once stupefied and filled with tumultuous emotions, states\r\napparently incompatible, yet sometimes co-existent. He recognized her.\r\nHer eyes were closed, but her face was turned towards him. It was the\r\nduchess--she, the mysterious being in whom all the splendours of the\r\nunknown were united; she who had occasioned him so many unavowable\r\ndreams; she who had written him so strange a letter! The only woman in\r\nthe world of whom he could say, “She has seen me, and she desires me!”\r\n\r\nHe had dismissed the dreams from his mind; he had burnt the letter. He\r\nhad, as far as lay in his power, banished the remembrance of her from\r\nhis thoughts and dreams. He no longer thought of her. He had forgotten\r\nher....\r\n\r\nAgain he saw her, and saw her terrible in power. His breath came in\r\nshort catches. He felt as if he were in a storm-driven cloud. He looked.\r\nThis woman before him! Was it possible? At the theatre a duchess; here a\r\nnereid, a nymph, a fairy. Always an apparition. He tried to fly, but\r\nfelt the futility of the attempt. His eyes were riveted on the vision,\r\nas though he were bound. Was she a woman? Was she a maiden? Both.\r\nMessalina was perhaps present, though invisible, and smiled, while Diana\r\nkept watch.\r\n\r\nOver all her beauty was the radiance of inaccessibility. No purity could\r\ncompare with her chaste and haughty form. Certain snows, which have\r\nnever been touched, give an idea of it--such as the sacred whiteness of\r\nthe Jungfrau. Immodesty was merged in splendour. She felt the security\r\nof an Olympian, who knew that she was daughter of the depths, and might\r\nsay to the ocean, “Father!” And she exposed herself, unattainable and\r\nproud, to everything that should pass--to looks, to desires, to ravings,\r\nto dreams; as proud in her languor, on her boudoir couch, as Venus in\r\nthe immensity of the sea-foam.\r\n\r\nShe had slept all night, and was prolonging her sleep into the daylight;\r\nher boldness, begun in shadow, continued in light.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine shuddered. He admired her with an unhealthy and absorbing\r\nadmiration, which ended in fear. Misfortunes never come singly.\r\nGwynplaine thought he had drained to the dregs the cup of his ill-luck.\r\nNow it was refilled. Who was it who was hurling all those unremitting\r\nthunderbolts on his devoted head, and who had now thrown against him, as\r\nhe stood trembling there, a sleeping goddess? What! was the dangerous\r\nand desirable object of his dream lurking all the while behind these\r\nsuccessive glimpses of heaven? Did these favours of the mysterious\r\ntempter tend to inspire him with vague aspirations and confused ideas,\r\nand overwhelm him with an intoxicating series of realities proceeding\r\nfrom apparent impossibilities? Wherefore did all the shadows conspire\r\nagainst him, a wretched man; and what would become of him, with all\r\nthose evil smiles of fortune beaming on him? Was his temptation\r\nprearranged? This woman, how and why was she there? No explanation! Why\r\nhim? Why her? Was he made a peer of England expressly for this duchess?\r\nWho had brought them together? Who was the dupe? Who the victim? Whose\r\nsimplicity was being abused? Was it God who was being deceived? All\r\nthese undefined thoughts passed confusedly, like a flight of dark\r\nshadows, through his brain. That magical and malevolent abode, that\r\nstrange and prison-like palace, was it also in the plot? Gwynplaine\r\nsuffered a partial unconsciousness. Suppressed emotions threatened to\r\nstrangle him. He was weighed down by an overwhelming force. His will\r\nbecame powerless. How could he resist? He was incoherent and entranced.\r\nThis time he felt he was becoming irremediably insane. His dark,\r\nheadlong fall over the precipice of stupefaction continued.\r\n\r\nBut the woman slept on.\r\n\r\nWhat aggravated the storm within him was, that he saw not the princess,\r\nnot the duchess, not the lady, but the woman.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, losing all self-command, trembled. What could he do against\r\nsuch a temptation? Here were no skilful effects of dress, no silken\r\nfolds, no complex and coquettish adornments, no affected exaggeration of\r\nconcealment or of exhibition, no cloud. It was fearful simplicity--a\r\nsort of mysterious summons--the shameless audacity of Eden. The whole of\r\nthe dark side of human nature was there. Eve worse than Satan; the human\r\nand the superhuman commingled. A perplexing ecstasy, winding up in a\r\nbrutal triumph of instinct over duty. The sovereign contour of beauty is\r\nimperious. When it leaves the ideal and condescends to be real, its\r\nproximity is fatal to man.\r\n\r\nNow and then the duchess moved softly on the bed, with the vague\r\nmovement of a cloud in the heavens, changing as a vapour changes its\r\nform. Absurd as it may appear, though he saw her present in the flesh\r\nbefore him, yet she seemed a chimera; and, palpable as she was, she\r\nseemed to him afar off. Scared and livid, he gazed on. He listened for\r\nher breathing, and fancied he heard only a phantom’s respiration. He\r\nwas attracted, though against his will. How arm himself against her--or\r\nagainst himself? He had been prepared for everything except this danger.\r\nA savage doorkeeper, a raging monster of a jailer--such were his\r\nexpected antagonists. He looked for Cerberus; he saw Hebe. A sleeping\r\nwoman! What an opponent! He closed his eyes. Too bright a dawn blinds\r\nthe eyes. But through his closed eyelids there penetrated at once the\r\nwoman’s form--not so distinct, but beautiful as ever.\r\n\r\nFly! Easier said than done. He had already tried and failed. He was\r\nrooted to the ground, as if in a dream. When we try to draw back,\r\ntemptation clogs our feet and glues them to the earth. We can still\r\nadvance, but to retire is impossible. The invisible arms of sin rise\r\nfrom below and drag us down.\r\n\r\nThere is a commonplace idea, accepted by every one, that feelings become\r\nblunted by experience. Nothing can be more untrue. You might as well say\r\nthat by dropping nitric acid slowly on a sore it would heal and become\r\nsound, and that torture dulled the sufferings of Damiens. The truth is,\r\nthat each fresh application intensifies the pain.\r\n\r\nFrom one surprise after another, Gwynplaine had become desperate. That\r\ncup, his reason, under this new stupor, was overflowing. He felt within\r\nhim a terrible awakening. Compass he no longer possessed. One idea only\r\nwas before him--the woman. An indescribable happiness appeared, which\r\nthreatened to overwhelm him. He could no longer decide for himself.\r\nThere was an irresistible current and a reef. The reef was not a rock,\r\nbut a siren--a magnet at the bottom of the abyss. He wished to tear\r\nhimself away from this magnet; but how was he to carry out his wish? He\r\nhad ceased to feel any basis of support. Who can foresee the\r\nfluctuations of the human mind! A man may be wrecked, as is a ship.\r\nConscience is an anchor. It is a terrible thing, but, like the anchor,\r\nconscience may be carried away.\r\n\r\nHe had not even the chance of being repulsed on account of his terrible\r\ndisfigurement. The woman had written to say that she loved him.\r\n\r\nIn every crisis there is a moment when the scale hesitates before\r\nkicking the beam. When we lean to the worst side of our nature, instead\r\nof strengthening our better qualities, the moral force which has been\r\npreserving the balance gives way, and down we go. Had this critical\r\nmoment in Gwynplaine’s life arrived?\r\n\r\nHow could he escape?\r\n\r\nSo it is she--the duchess, the woman! There she was in that lonely\r\nroom--asleep, far from succour, helpless, alone, at his mercy; yet he\r\nwas in her power! The duchess! We have, perchance, observed a star in\r\nthe distant firmament. We have admired it. It is so far off. What can\r\nthere be to make us shudder in a fixed star? Well, one day--one night,\r\nrather--it moves. We perceive a trembling gleam around it. The star\r\nwhich we imagined to be immovable is in motion. It is no longer a star,\r\nbut a comet--the incendiary giant of the skies. The luminary moves on,\r\ngrows bigger, shakes off a shower of sparks and fire, and becomes\r\nenormous. It advances towards us. Oh, horror, it is coming our way! The\r\ncomet recognizes us, marks us for its own, and will not be turned aside.\r\nIrresistible attack of the heavens! What is it which is bearing down on\r\nus? An excess of light, which blinds us; an excess of life, which kills\r\nus. That proposal which the heavens make we refuse; that unfathomable\r\nlove we reject. We close our eyes; we hide; we tear ourselves away; we\r\nimagine the danger is past. We open our eyes: the formidable star is\r\nstill before us; but, no longer a star, it has become a world--a world\r\nunknown, a world of lava and ashes; the devastating prodigy of space. It\r\nfills the sky, allowing no compeers. The carbuncle of the firmament’s\r\ndepths, a diamond in the distance, when drawn close to us becomes a\r\nfurnace. You are caught in its flames. And the first sensation of\r\nburning is that of a heavenly warmth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSATAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly the sleeper awoke. She sat up with a sudden and gracious\r\ndignity of movement, her fair silken tresses falling in soft disorder.\r\nThen stretching herself, she yawned like a tigress in the rising sun.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Gwynplaine breathed heavily, as we do when we endeavour to\r\nrestrain our respiration.\r\n\r\n“Is any one there?” said she.\r\n\r\nShe yawned as she spoke, and her very yawn was graceful. Gwynplaine\r\nlistened to the unfamiliar voice--the voice of a charmer, its accents\r\nexquisitely haughty, its caressing intonation softening its native\r\narrogance. Then rising on her knees--there is an antique statue kneeling\r\nthus in the midst of a thousand transparent folds--she drew the\r\ndressing-gown towards her, and springing from the couch stood upright.\r\nIn the twinkling of an eye the silken robe was around her. The trailing\r\nsleeve concealed her hands; only the tips of her toes, with little pink\r\nnails like those of an infant, were left visible. Having drawn from\r\nunderneath the dressing-gown a mass of hair which had been imprisoned by\r\nit, she crossed behind the couch to the end of the room, and placed her\r\near to the painted mirror, which was, apparently, a door. Tapping the\r\nglass with her finger, she called, “Is any one there? Lord David? Are\r\nyou come already? What time is it then? Is that you, Barkilphedro?” She\r\nturned from the glass. “No! it was not there. Is there any one in the\r\nbathroom? Will you answer? Of course not. No one could come that way.”\r\n\r\nGoing to the silver lace curtain, she raised it with her foot, thrust it\r\naside with her shoulder, and entered the marble room. An agonized\r\nnumbness fell upon Gwynplaine. No possibility of concealment. It was too\r\nlate to fly. Moreover, he was no longer equal to the exertion. He wished\r\nthat the earth might open and swallow him up. Anything to hide him.\r\n\r\nShe saw him. She stared, immensely astonished, but without the slightest\r\nnervousness. Then, in a tone of mingled pleasure and contempt, she said,\r\n“Why, it is Gwynplaine!” Suddenly with a rapid spring, for this cat was\r\na panther, she flung herself on his neck.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, pushing him back, and holding him by both shoulders with her\r\nsmall claw-like hands, she stood up face to face with him, and began to\r\ngaze at him with a strange expression.\r\n\r\nIt was a fatal glance she gave him with her Aldebaran-like eyes--a\r\nglance at once equivocal and starlike. Gwynplaine watched the blue eye\r\nand the black eye, distracted by the double ray of heaven and of hell\r\nthat shone in the orbs thus fixed on him. The man and the woman threw a\r\nmalign dazzling reflection one on the other. Both were fascinated--he\r\nby her beauty, she by his deformity. Both were in a measure\r\nawe-stricken. Pressed down, as by an overwhelming weight, he was\r\nspeechless.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she cried. “How clever you are! You are come. You found out that I\r\nwas obliged to leave London. You followed me. That was right. Your being\r\nhere proves you to be a wonder.”\r\n\r\nThe simultaneous return of self-possession acts like a flash of\r\nlightning. Gwynplaine, indistinctly warned by a vague, rude, but honest\r\nmisgiving, drew back, but the pink nails clung to his shoulders and\r\nrestrained him. Some inexorable power proclaimed its sway over him. He\r\nhimself, a wild beast, was caged in a wild beast’s den. She continued,\r\n“Anne, the fool--you know whom I mean--the queen--ordered me to Windsor\r\nwithout giving any reason. When I arrived she was closeted with her\r\nidiot of a Chancellor. But how did you contrive to obtain access to me?\r\nThat’s what I call being a man. Obstacles, indeed! there are no such\r\nthings. You come at a call. You found things out. My name, the Duchess\r\nJosiana, you knew, I fancy. Who was it brought you in? No doubt it was\r\nthe page. Oh, he is clever! I will give him a hundred guineas. Which way\r\ndid you get in? Tell me! No, don’t tell me; I don’t want to know.\r\nExplanations diminish interest. I prefer the marvellous, and you are\r\nhideous enough to be wonderful. You have fallen from the highest\r\nheavens, or you have risen from the depths of hell through the devil’s\r\ntrap-door. Nothing can be more natural. The ceiling opened or the floor\r\nyawned. A descent in a cloud, or an ascent in a mass of fire and\r\nbrimstone, that is how you have travelled. You have a right to enter\r\nlike the gods. Agreed; you are my lover.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine was scared, and listened, his mind growing more irresolute\r\nevery moment. Now all was certain. Impossible to have any further doubt.\r\nThat letter! the woman confirmed its meaning. Gwynplaine the lover and\r\nthe beloved of a duchess! Mighty pride, with its thousand baleful heads,\r\nstirred his wretched heart. Vanity, that powerful agent within us, works\r\nus measureless evil.\r\n\r\nThe duchess went on, “Since you are here, it is so decreed. I ask\r\nnothing more. There is some one on high, or in hell, who brings us\r\ntogether. The betrothal of Styx and Aurora! Unbridled ceremonies beyond\r\nall laws! The very day I first saw you I said, ‘It is he!’ I recognize\r\nhim. He is the monster of my dreams. He shall be mine. We should give\r\ndestiny a helping hand. Therefore I wrote to you. One question,\r\nGwynplaine: do you believe in predestination? For my part, I have\r\nbelieved in it since I read, in Cicero, Scipio’s dream. Ah! I did not\r\nobserve it. Dressed like a gentleman! You in fine clothes! Why not? You\r\nare a mountebank. All the more reason. A juggler is as good as a lord.\r\nMoreover, what are lords? Clowns. You have a noble figure; you are\r\nmagnificently made. It is wonderful that you should be here. When did\r\nyou arrive? How long have you been here? Did you see me naked? I am\r\nbeautiful, am I not? I was going to take my bath. Oh, how I love you!\r\nYou read my letter! Did you read it yourself? Did any one read it to\r\nyou? Can you read? Probably you are ignorant. I ask questions, but don’t\r\nanswer them. I don’t like the sound of your voice. It is soft. An\r\nextraordinary thing like you should snarl, and not speak. You sing\r\nharmoniously. I hate it. It is the only thing about you that I do not\r\nlike. All the rest is terrible--is grand. In India you would be a god.\r\nWere you born with that frightful laugh on your face? No! No doubt it is\r\na penal brand. I do hope you have committed some crime. Come to my\r\narms.”\r\n\r\nShe sank on the couch, and made him sit beside her. They found\r\nthemselves close together unconsciously. What she said passed over\r\nGwynplaine like a mighty storm. He hardly understood the meaning of her\r\nwhirlwind of words. Her eyes were full of admiration. She spoke\r\ntumultuously, frantically, with a voice broken and tender. Her words\r\nwere music, but their music was to Gwynplaine as a hurricane. Again she\r\nfixed her gaze upon him and continued,--\r\n\r\n“I feel degraded in your presence, and oh, what happiness that is! How\r\ninsipid it is to be a grandee! I am noble; what can be more tiresome?\r\nDisgrace is a comfort. I am so satiated with respect that I long for\r\ncontempt. We are all a little erratic, from Venus, Cleopatra, Mesdames\r\nde Chevreuse and de Longueville, down to myself. I will make a display\r\nof you, I declare. Here’s a love affair which will be a blow to my\r\nfamily, the Stuarts. Ah! I breathe again. I have discovered a secret. I\r\nam clear of royalty. To be free from its trammels is indeed deliverance.\r\nTo break down, defy, make and destroy at will, that is true enjoyment.\r\nListen, I love you.”\r\n\r\nShe paused; then with a frightful smile went on, “I love you, not only\r\nbecause you are deformed, but because you are low. I love monsters, and\r\nI love mountebanks. A lover despised, mocked, grotesque, hideous,\r\nexposed to laughter on that pillory called a theatre, has for me an\r\nextraordinary attraction. It is tasting the fruit of hell. An infamous\r\nlover, how exquisite! To taste the apple, not of Paradise, but of\r\nhell--such is my temptation. It is for that I hunger and thirst. I am\r\nthat Eve, the Eve of the depths. Probably you are, unknown to yourself,\r\na devil. I am in love with a nightmare. You are a moving puppet, of\r\nwhich the strings are pulled by a spectre. You are the incarnation of\r\ninfernal mirth. You are the master I require. I wanted a lover such as\r\nthose of Medea and Canidia. I felt sure that some night would bring me\r\nsuch a one. You are all that I want. I am talking of a heap of things of\r\nwhich you probably know nothing. Gwynplaine, hitherto I have remained\r\nuntouched; I give myself to you, pure as a burning ember. You evidently\r\ndo not believe me; but if you only knew how little I care!”\r\n\r\nHer words flowed like a volcanic eruption. Pierce Mount Etna, and you\r\nmay obtain some idea of that jet of fiery eloquence.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine stammered, “Madame--”\r\n\r\nShe placed her hand on his mouth. “Silence,” she said. “I am studying\r\nyou. I am unbridled desire, immaculate. I am a vestal bacchante. No man\r\nhas known me, and I might be the virgin pythoness at Delphos, and have\r\nunder my naked foot the bronze tripod, where the priests lean their\r\nelbows on the skin of the python, whispering questions to the invisible\r\ngod. My heart is of stone, but it is like those mysterious pebbles which\r\nthe sea washes to the foot of the rock called Huntly Nabb, at the mouth\r\nof the Tees, and which if broken are found to contain a serpent. That\r\nserpent is my love--a love which is all-powerful, for it has brought you\r\nto me. An impossible distance was between us. I was in Sirius, and you\r\nwere in Allioth. You have crossed the immeasurable space, and here you\r\nare. ’Tis well. Be silent. Take me.”\r\n\r\nShe ceased; he trembled. Then she went on, smiling, “You see,\r\nGwynplaine, to dream is to create; to desire is to summon. To build up\r\nthe chimera is to provoke the reality. The all-powerful and terrible\r\nmystery will not be defied. It produces result. You are here. Do I dare\r\nto lose caste? Yes. Do I dare to be your mistress--your concubine--your\r\nslave--your chattel? Joyfully. Gwynplaine, I am woman. Woman is clay\r\nlonging to become mire. I want to despise myself. That lends a zest to\r\npride. The alloy of greatness is baseness. They combine in perfection.\r\nDespise me, you who are despised. Nothing can be better. Degradation on\r\ndegradation. What joy! I pluck the double blossom of ignominy. Trample\r\nme under foot. You will only love me the more. I am sure of it. Do you\r\nunderstand why I idolize you? Because I despise you. You are so\r\nimmeasurably below me that I place you on an altar. Bring the highest\r\nand lowest depths together, and you have Chaos, and I delight in\r\nChaos--Chaos, the beginning and end of everything. What is Chaos? A huge\r\nblot. Out of that blot God made light, and out of that sink the world.\r\nYou don’t know how perverse I can be. Knead a star in mud, and you will\r\nhave my likeness.”\r\n\r\nShe went on,--\r\n\r\n“A wolf to all beside; a faithful dog to you. How astonished they will\r\nall be! The astonishment of fools is amusing. I understand myself. Am I\r\na goddess? Amphitrite gave herself to the Cyclops. _Fluctivoma\r\nAmphitrite_. Am I a fairy? Urgele gave herself to Bugryx, a winged man,\r\nwith eight webbed hands. Am I a princess? Marie Stuart had Rizzio. Three\r\nbeauties, three monsters. I am greater than they, for you are lower than\r\nthey. Gwynplaine, we were made for one another. The monster that you are\r\noutwardly, I am within. Thence my love for you. A caprice? Just so. What\r\nis a hurricane but a caprice? Our stars have a certain affinity.\r\nTogether we are things of night--you in your face, I in my mind. As your\r\ncountenance is defaced, so is my mind. You, in your turn, create me. You\r\ncome, and my real soul shows itself. I did not know it. It is\r\nastonishing. Your coming has evoked the hydra in me, who am a goddess.\r\nYou reveal my real nature. See how I resemble you. Look at me as if I\r\nwere a mirror. Your face is my mind. I did not know I was so terrible. I\r\nam also, then, a monster. O Gwynplaine, you do amuse me!”\r\n\r\nShe laughed, a strange and childlike laugh; and, putting her mouth\r\nclose to his ear, whispered,--\r\n\r\n“Do you want to see a mad woman? look at me.”\r\n\r\nShe poured her searching look into Gwynplaine. A look is a philtre. Her\r\nloosened robe provoked a thousand dangerous feelings. Blind, animal\r\necstasy was invading his mind--ecstasy combined with agony. Whilst she\r\nspoke, though he felt her words like burning coals, his blood froze\r\nwithin his veins. He had not strength to utter a word.\r\n\r\nShe stopped, and looked at him.\r\n\r\n“O monster!” she cried. She grew wild.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she seized his hands.\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine, I am the throne; you are the footstool. Let us join on the\r\nsame level. Oh, how happy I am in my fall! I wish all the world could\r\nknow how abject I am become. It would bow down all the lower. The more\r\nman abhors, the more does he cringe. It is human nature. Hostile, but\r\nreptile; dragon, but worm. Oh, I am as depraved as are the gods! They\r\ncan never say that I am not a king’s bastard. I act like a queen. Who\r\nwas Rodope but a queen loving Pteh, a man with a crocodile’s head? She\r\nraised the third pyramid in his honour. Penthesilea loved the centaur,\r\nwho, being now a star, is named Sagittarius. And what do you say about\r\nAnne of Austria? Mazarin was ugly enough! Now, you are not only ugly;\r\nyou are deformed. Ugliness is mean, deformity is grand. Ugliness is the\r\ndevil’s grin behind beauty; deformity is the reverse of sublimity. It is\r\nthe back view. Olympus has two aspects. One, by day, shows Apollo; the\r\nother, by night, shows Polyphemus. You--you are a Titan. You would be\r\nBehemoth in the forests, Leviathan in the deep, and Typhon in the sewer.\r\nYou surpass everything. There is the trace of lightning in your\r\ndeformity; your face has been battered by the thunderbolt. The jagged\r\ncontortion of forked lightning has imprinted its mark on your face. It\r\nstruck you and passed on. A mighty and mysterious wrath has, in a fit of\r\npassion, cemented your spirit in a terrible and superhuman form. Hell is\r\na penal furnace, where the iron called Fatality is raised to a white\r\nheat. You have been branded with it. To love you is to understand\r\ngrandeur. I enjoy that triumph. To be in love with Apollo--a fine\r\neffort, forsooth! Glory is to be measured by the astonishment it\r\ncreates. I love you. I have dreamt of you night after night. This is my\r\npalace. You shall see my gardens. There are fresh springs under the\r\nshrubs; arbours for lovers; and beautiful groups of marble statuary by\r\nBernini. Flowers! there are too many--during the spring the place is on\r\nfire with roses. Did I tell you that the queen is my sister? Do what you\r\nlike with me. I am made for Jupiter to kiss my feet, and for Satan to\r\nspit in my face. Are you of any religion? I am a Papist. My father,\r\nJames II., died in France, surrounded by Jesuits. I have never felt\r\nbefore as I feel now that I am near you. Oh, how I should like to pass\r\nthe evening with you, in the midst of music, both reclining on the same\r\ncushion, under a purple awning, in a gilded gondola on the soft expanse\r\nof ocean! Insult me, beat me, kick me, cuff me, treat me like a brute! I\r\nadore you.”\r\n\r\nCaresses can roar. If you doubt it, observe the lion’s. The woman was\r\nhorrible, and yet full of grace. The effect was tragic. First he felt\r\nthe claw, then the velvet of the paw. A feline attack, made up of\r\nadvances and retreats. There was death as well as sport in this game of\r\ncome and go. She idolized him, but arrogantly. The result was contagious\r\nfrenzy. Fatal language, at once inexpressible, violent, and sweet. The\r\ninsulter did not insult; the adorer outraged the object of adoration.\r\nShe, who buffeted, deified him. Her tones imparted to her violent yet\r\namorous words an indescribable Promethean grandeur. According to\r\nÆschylus, in the orgies in honour of the great goddess the women were\r\nsmitten by this evil frenzy when they pursued the satyrs under the\r\nstars. Such paroxysms raged in the mysterious dances in the grove of\r\nDodona. This woman was as if transfigured--if, indeed, we can term that\r\ntransfiguration which is the antithesis of heaven.\r\n\r\nHer hair quivered like a mane; her robe opened and closed. The sunshine\r\nof the blue eye mingled with the fire of the black one. She was\r\nunearthly.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, giving way, felt himself vanquished by the deep subtilty of\r\nthis attack.\r\n\r\n“I love you!” she cried. And she bit him with a kiss.\r\n\r\nHomeric clouds were, perhaps, about to be required to encompass\r\nGwynplaine and Josiana, as they did Jupiter and Juno. For Gwynplaine to\r\nbe loved by a woman who could see and who saw him, to feel on his\r\ndeformed mouth the pressure of divine lips, was exquisite and\r\nmaddening. Before this woman, full of enigmas, all else faded away in\r\nhis mind. The remembrance of Dea struggled in the shadows with weak\r\ncries. There is an antique bas-relief representing the Sphinx devouring\r\na Cupid. The wings of the sweet celestial are bleeding between the\r\nfierce, grinning fangs.\r\n\r\nDid Gwynplaine love this woman? Has man, like the globe, two poles? Are\r\nwe, on our inflexible axis, a moving sphere, a star when seen from afar,\r\nmud when seen more closely, in which night alternates with day? Has the\r\nheart two aspects--one on which its love is poured forth in light; the\r\nother in darkness? Here a woman of light, there a woman of the sewer.\r\nAngels are necessary. Is it possible that demons are also essential? Has\r\nthe soul the wings of the bat? Does twilight fall fatally for all? Is\r\nsin an integral and inevitable part of our destiny? Must we accept evil\r\nas part and portion of our whole? Do we inherit sin as a debt? What\r\nawful subjects for thought!\r\n\r\nYet a voice tells us that weakness is a crime. Gwynplaine’s feelings are\r\nnot to be described. The flesh, life, terror, lust, an overwhelming\r\nintoxication of spirit, and all the shame possible to pride. Was he\r\nabout to succumb?\r\n\r\nShe repeated, “I love you!” and flung her frenzied arms around him.\r\nGwynplaine panted.\r\n\r\nSuddenly close at hand there rang, clear and distinct, a little bell. It\r\nwas the little bell inside the wall. The duchess, turning her head,\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n“What does she want of me?”\r\n\r\nQuickly, with the noise of a spring door, the silver panel, with the\r\ngolden crown chased on it, opened. A compartment of a shaft, lined with\r\nroyal blue velvet, appeared, and on a golden salver a letter. The\r\nletter, broad and weighty, was placed so as to exhibit the seal, which\r\nwas a large impression in red wax. The bell continued to tinkle. The\r\nopen panel almost touched the couch where the duchess and Gwynplaine\r\nwere sitting.\r\n\r\nLeaning over, but still keeping her arm round his neck, she took the\r\nletter from the plate, and touched the panel. The compartment closed in,\r\nand the bell ceased ringing.\r\n\r\nThe duchess broke the seal, and, opening the envelope, drew out two\r\ndocuments contained therein, and flung it on the floor at Gwynplaine’s\r\nfeet. The impression of the broken seal was still decipherable, and\r\nGwynplaine could distinguish a royal crown over the initial A. The torn\r\nenvelope lay open before him, so that he could read, “To Her Grace the\r\nDuchess Josiana.” The envelope had contained both vellum and parchment.\r\nThe former was a small, the latter a large document. On the parchment\r\nwas a large Chancery seal in green wax, called Lords’ sealing-wax.\r\n\r\nThe face of the duchess, whose bosom was palpitating, and whose eyes\r\nwere swimming with passion, became overspread with a slight expression\r\nof dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she said. “What does she send me? A lot of papers! What a\r\nspoil-sport that woman is!”\r\n\r\nPushing aside the parchment, she opened the vellum.\r\n\r\n“It is her handwriting. It is my sister’s hand. It is quite provoking.\r\nGwynplaine, I asked you if you could read. Can you?”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine nodded assent.\r\n\r\nShe stretched herself at full length on the couch, carefully drew her\r\nfeet and arms under her robe, with a whimsical affectation of modesty,\r\nand, giving Gwynplaine the vellum, watched him with an impassioned look.\r\n\r\n“Well, you are mine. Begin your duties, my beloved. Read me what the\r\nqueen writes.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine took the vellum, unfolded it, and, in a voice tremulous with\r\nmany emotions, began to read:--\r\n\r\n“MADAM,--We are graciously pleased to send to you herewith, sealed and\r\nsigned by our trusty and well-beloved William Cowper, Lord High\r\nChancellor of England, a copy of a report showing forth the very\r\nimportant fact that the legitimate son of Linnæus Lord Clancharlie has\r\njust been discovered and recognized, bearing the name of Gwynplaine, in\r\nthe lowest rank of a wandering and vagabond life, among strollers and\r\nmountebanks. His false position dates from his earliest days. In\r\naccordance with the laws of the country, and in virtue of his hereditary\r\nrights, Lord Fermain Clancharlie, son of Lord Linnæus, will be this day\r\nadmitted, and installed in his position in the House of Lords.\r\nTherefore, having regard to your welfare, and wishing to preserve for\r\nyour use the property and estates of Lord Clancharlie of Hunkerville, we\r\nsubstitute him in the place of Lord David Dirry-Moir, and recommend him\r\nto your good graces. We have caused Lord Fermain to be conducted to\r\nCorleone Lodge. We will and command, as sister and as Queen, that the\r\nsaid Fermain Lord Clancharlie, hitherto called Gwynplaine, shall be your\r\nhusband, and that you shall marry him. Such is our royal pleasure.”\r\n\r\nWhile Gwynplaine, in tremulous tones which varied at almost every word,\r\nwas reading the document, the duchess, half risen from the couch,\r\nlistened with fixed attention. When Gwynplaine finished, she snatched\r\nthe letter from his hands.\r\n\r\n“Anne R,” she murmured in a tone of abstraction. Then picking up from\r\nthe floor the parchment she had thrown down, she ran her eye over it. It\r\nwas the confession of the shipwrecked crew of the _Matutina_, embodied\r\nin a report signed by the sheriff of Southwark and by the lord\r\nchancellor.\r\n\r\nHaving perused the report, she read the queen’s letter over again. Then\r\nshe said, “Be it so.” And calmly pointing with her finger to the door of\r\nthe gallery through which he had entered, she added, “Begone.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine was petrified, and remained immovable. She repeated, in icy\r\ntones, “Since you are my husband, begone.” Gwynplaine, speechless, and\r\nwith eyes downcast like a criminal, remained motionless. She added, “You\r\nhave no right to be here; it is my lover’s place.” Gwynplaine was like a\r\nman transfixed. “Very well,” said she; “I must go myself. So you are my\r\nhusband. Nothing can be better. I hate you.” She rose, and with an\r\nindescribably haughty gesture of adieu left the room. The curtain in the\r\ndoorway of the gallery fell behind her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHEY RECOGNIZE, BUT DO NOT KNOW, EACH OTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nGwynplaine was alone--alone, and in the presence of the tepid bath and\r\nthe deserted couch. The confusion in his mind had reached its\r\nculminating point. His thoughts no longer resembled thoughts. They\r\noverflowed and ran riot; it was the anguish of a creature wrestling with\r\nperplexity. He felt as if he were awaking from a horrid nightmare. The\r\nentrance into unknown spheres is no simple matter.\r\n\r\nFrom the time he had received the duchess’s letter, brought by the\r\npage, a series of surprising adventures had befallen Gwynplaine, each\r\none less intelligible than the other. Up to this time, though in a\r\ndream, he had seen things clearly. Now he could only grope his way. He\r\nno longer thought, nor even dreamed. He collapsed. He sank down upon the\r\ncouch which the duchess had vacated.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he heard a sound of footsteps, and those of a man. The noise\r\ncame from the opposite side of the gallery to that by which the duchess\r\nhad departed. The man approached, and his footsteps, though deadened by\r\nthe carpet, were clear and distinct. Gwynplaine, in spite of his\r\nabstraction, listened.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, beyond the silver web of curtain which the duchess had left\r\npartly open, a door, evidently concealed by the painted glass, opened\r\nwide, and there came floating into the room the refrain of an old French\r\nsong, carolled at the top of a manly and joyous voice,--\r\n\r\n  “Trois petits gorets sur leur fumier\r\n  Juraient comme de porteurs de chaise,”\r\n\r\nand a man entered. He wore a sword by his side, a magnificent naval\r\nuniform, covered with gold lace, and held in his hand a plumed hat with\r\nloops and cockade. Gwynplaine sprang up erect as if moved by springs. He\r\nrecognized the man, and was, in turn, recognized by him. From their\r\nastonished lips came, simultaneously, this double exclamation:--\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine!”\r\n\r\n“Tom-Jim-Jack!”\r\n\r\nThe man with the plumed hat advanced towards Gwynplaine, who stood with\r\nfolded arms.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing here, Gwynplaine?”\r\n\r\n“And you, Tom-Jim-Jack, what are you doing here?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I understand. Josiana! a caprice. A mountebank and a monster! The\r\ndouble attraction is too powerful to be resisted. You disguised yourself\r\nin order to get here, Gwynplaine?”\r\n\r\n“And you, too, Tom-Jim-Jack?”\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine, what does this gentleman’s dress mean?”\r\n\r\n“Tom-Jim-Jack, what does that officer’s uniform mean?”\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine, I answer no questions.”\r\n\r\n“Neither do I, Tom-Jim-Jack.”\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine, my name is not Tom-Jim-Jack.”\r\n\r\n“Tom-Jim-Jack, my name is not Gwynplaine.”\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine, I am here in my own house.”\r\n\r\n“I am here in my own house, Tom-Jim-Jack.”\r\n\r\n“I will not have you echo my words. You are ironical; but I’ve got a\r\ncane. An end to your jokes, you wretched fool.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine became ashy pale. “You are a fool yourself, and you shall\r\ngive me satisfaction for this insult.”\r\n\r\n“In your booth as much as you like, with fisticuffs.”\r\n\r\n“Here, and with swords?”\r\n\r\n“My friend Gwynplaine, the sword is a weapon for gentlemen. With it I\r\ncan only fight my equals. At fisticuffs we are equal, but not so with\r\nswords. At the Tadcaster Inn Tom-Jim-Jack could box with Gwynplaine; at\r\nWindsor the case is altered. Understand this: I am a rear-admiral.”\r\n\r\n“And I am a peer of England.”\r\n\r\nThe man whom Gwynplaine recognized as Tom-Jim-Jack burst out laughing.\r\n“Why not a king? Indeed, you are right. An actor plays every part.\r\nYou’ll tell me next that you are Theseus, Duke of Athens.”\r\n\r\n“I am a peer of England, and we are going to fight.”\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine, this becomes tiresome. Don’t play with one who can order\r\nyou to be flogged. I am Lord David Dirry-Moir.”\r\n\r\n“And I am Lord Clancharlie.”\r\n\r\nAgain Lord David burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n“Well said! Gwynplaine is Lord Clancharlie. That is indeed the name the\r\nman must bear who is to win Josiana. Listen. I forgive you; and do you\r\nknow the reason? It’s because we are both lovers of the same woman.”\r\n\r\nThe curtain in the door was lifted, and a voice exclaimed, “You are the\r\ntwo husbands, my lords.”\r\n\r\nThey turned.\r\n\r\n“Barkilphedro!” cried Lord David.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed he; he bowed low to the two lords, with a smile on his\r\nface. Some few paces behind him was a gentleman with a stern and\r\ndignified countenance, who carried in his hand a black wand. This\r\ngentleman advanced, and, bowing three times to Gwynplaine, said, “I am\r\nthe Usher of the Black Rod. I come to fetch your lordship, in obedience\r\nto her Majesty’s commands.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE EIGHTH.\r\n\r\n_THE CAPITOL AND THINGS AROUND IT._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF MAJESTIC MATTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIrresistible Fate ever carrying him forward, which had now for so many\r\nhours showered its surprises on Gwynplaine, and which had transported\r\nhim to Windsor, transferred him again to London. Visionary realities\r\nsucceeded each other without a moment’s intermission. He could not\r\nescape from their influence. Freed from one he met another. He had\r\nscarcely time to breathe. Any one who has seen a juggler throwing and\r\ncatching balls can judge the nature of fate. Those rising and falling\r\nprojectiles are like men tossed in the hands of Destiny--projectiles and\r\nplaythings.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the same day, Gwynplaine was an actor in an\r\nextraordinary scene. He was seated on a bench covered with\r\nfleurs-de-lis; over his silken clothes he wore a robe of scarlet velvet,\r\nlined with white silk, with a cape of ermine, and on his shoulders two\r\nbands of ermine embroidered with gold. Around him were men of all ages,\r\nyoung and old, seated like him on benches covered with fleurs-de-lis,\r\nand dressed like him in ermine and purple. In front of him other men\r\nwere kneeling, clothed in black silk gowns. Some of them were writing;\r\nopposite, and a short distance from him, he observed steps, a raised\r\nplatform, a dais, a large escutcheon glittering between a lion and a\r\nunicorn, and at the top of the steps, on the platform under the dais,\r\nresting against the escutcheon, was a gilded chair with a crown over\r\nit. This was a throne--the throne of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, himself a peer of England, was in the House of Lords. How\r\nGwynplaine’s introduction to the House of Lords came about, we will now\r\nexplain. Throughout the day, from morning to night, from Windsor to\r\nLondon, from Corleone Lodge to Westminster Hall, he had step by step\r\nmounted higher in the social grade. At each step he grew giddier. He had\r\nbeen conveyed from Windsor in a royal carriage with a peer’s escort.\r\nThere is not much difference between a guard of honour and a prisoner’s.\r\nOn that day, travellers on the London and Windsor road saw a galloping\r\ncavalcade of gentlemen pensioners of her Majesty’s household escorting\r\ntwo carriages drawn at a rapid pace. In the first carriage sat the Usher\r\nof the Black Rod, his wand in his hand. In the second was to be seen a\r\nlarge hat with white plumes, throwing into shadow and hiding the face\r\nunderneath it. Who was it who was thus being hurried on--a prince, a\r\nprisoner? It was Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nIt looked as if they were conducting some one to the Tower, unless,\r\nindeed, they were escorting him to the House of Lords. The queen had\r\ndone things well. As it was for her future brother-in-law, she had\r\nprovided an escort from her own household. The officer of the Usher of\r\nthe Black Rod rode on horseback at the head of the cavalcade. The Usher\r\nof the Black Rod carried, on a cushion placed on a seat of the carriage,\r\na black portfolio stamped with the royal crown. At Brentford, the last\r\nrelay before London, the carriages and escort halted. A four-horse\r\ncarriage of tortoise-shell, with two postilions, a coachman in a wig,\r\nand four footmen, was in waiting. The wheels, steps, springs, pole, and\r\nall the fittings of this carriage were gilt. The horses’ harness was of\r\nsilver. This state coach was of an ancient and extraordinary shape, and\r\nwould have been distinguished by its grandeur among the fifty-one\r\ncelebrated carriages of which Roubo has left us drawings.\r\n\r\nThe Usher of the Black Rod and his officer alighted. The latter, having\r\nlifted the cushion, on which rested the royal portfolio, from the seat\r\nin the postchaise, carried it on outstretched hands, and stood behind\r\nthe Usher. He first opened the door of the empty carriage, then the door\r\nof that occupied by Gwynplaine, and, with downcast eyes, respectfully\r\ninvited him to descend. Gwynplaine left the chaise, and took his seat in\r\nthe carriage. The Usher carrying the rod, and the officer supporting the\r\ncushion, followed, and took their places on the low front seat provided\r\nfor pages in old state coaches. The inside of the carriage was lined\r\nwith white satin trimmed with Binche silk, with tufts and tassels of\r\nsilver. The roof was painted with armorial bearings. The postilions of\r\nthe chaises they were leaving were dressed in the royal livery. The\r\nattendants of the carriage they now entered wore a different but very\r\nmagnificent livery.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, in spite of his bewildered state, in which he felt quite\r\novercome, remarked the gorgeously-attired footmen, and asked the Usher\r\nof the Black Rod,--\r\n\r\n“Whose livery is that?”\r\n\r\nHe answered,--\r\n\r\n“Yours, my lord.”\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords was to sit that evening. _Curia erat serena_, run the\r\nold records. In England parliamentary work is by preference undertaken\r\nat night. It once happened that Sheridan began a speech at midnight and\r\nfinished it at sunrise.\r\n\r\nThe two postchaises returned to Windsor. Gwynplaine’s carriage set out\r\nfor London. This ornamented four-horse carriage proceeded at a walk from\r\nBrentford to London, as befitted the dignity of the coachman.\r\nGwynplaine’s servitude to ceremony was beginning in the shape of his\r\nsolemn-looking coachman. The delay was, moreover, apparently\r\nprearranged; and we shall see presently its probable motive.\r\n\r\nNight was falling, though it was not quite dark, when the carriage\r\nstopped at the King’s Gate, a large sunken door between two turrets\r\nconnecting Whitehall with Westminster. The escort of gentlemen\r\npensioners formed a circle around the carriage. A footman jumped down\r\nfrom behind it and opened the door. The Usher of the Black Rod, followed\r\nby the officer carrying the cushion, got out of the carriage, and\r\naddressed Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\n“My lord, be pleased to alight. I beg your lordship to keep your hat\r\non.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine wore under his travelling cloak the suit of black silk, which\r\nhe had not changed since the previous evening. He had no sword. He left\r\nhis cloak in the carriage. Under the arched way of the King’s Gate there\r\nwas a small side door raised some few steps above the road. In\r\nceremonial processions the greatest personage never walks first.\r\n\r\nThe Usher of the Black Rod, followed by his officer, walked first;\r\nGwynplaine followed. They ascended the steps, and entered by the side\r\ndoor. Presently they were in a wide, circular room, with a pillar in the\r\ncentre, the lower part of a turret. The room, being on the ground floor,\r\nwas lighted by narrow windows in the pointed arches, which served but to\r\nmake darkness visible. Twilight often lends solemnity to a scene.\r\nObscurity is in itself majestic.\r\n\r\nIn this room, thirteen men, disposed in ranks, were standing--three in\r\nthe front row, six in the second row, and four behind. In the front row\r\none wore a crimson velvet gown; the other two, gowns of the same colour,\r\nbut of satin. All three had the arms of England embroidered on their\r\nshoulders. The second rank wore tunics of white silk, each one having a\r\ndifferent coat of arms emblazoned in front. The last row were clad in\r\nblack silk, and were thus distinguished. The first wore a blue cape. The\r\nsecond had a scarlet St. George embroidered in front. The third, two\r\nembroidered crimson crosses, in front and behind. The fourth had a\r\ncollar of black sable fur. All were uncovered, wore wigs, and carried\r\nswords. Their faces were scarcely visible in the dim light, neither\r\ncould they see Gwynplaine’s face.\r\n\r\nThe Usher of the Black Rod, raising his wand, said,--\r\n\r\n“My Lord Fermain Clancharlie, Baron Clancharlie and Hunkerville, I, the\r\nUsher of the Black Rod, first officer of the presence chamber, hand your\r\nlordship over to Garter King-at-Arms.”\r\n\r\nThe person clothed in velvet, quitting his place in the ranks, bowed to\r\nthe ground before Gwynplaine, and said,--\r\n\r\n“My Lord Fermain Clancharlie, I am Garter, Principal King-at-Arms of\r\nEngland. I am the officer appointed and installed by his grace the Duke\r\nof Norfolk, hereditary Earl Marshal. I have sworn obedience to the king,\r\npeers, and knights of the garter. The day of my installation, when the\r\nEarl Marshal of England anointed me by pouring a goblet of wine on my\r\nhead, I solemnly promised to be attentive to the nobility; to avoid bad\r\ncompany; to excuse, rather than accuse, gentlefolks; and to assist\r\nwidows and virgins. It is I who have the charge of arranging the funeral\r\nceremonies of peers, and the supervision of their armorial bearings. I\r\nplace myself at the orders of your lordship.”\r\n\r\nThe first of those wearing satin tunics, having bowed deeply, said,--\r\n\r\n“My lord, I am Clarenceaux, Second King-at-Arms of England. I am the\r\nofficer who arranges the obsequies of nobles below the rank of peers. I\r\nam at your lordship’s disposal.”\r\n\r\nThe other wearer of the satin tunic bowed and spoke thus,--\r\n\r\n“My lord, I am Norroy, Third King-at-Arms of England. Command me.”\r\n\r\nThe second row, erect and without bowing, advanced a pace. The\r\nright-hand man said,--\r\n\r\n“My lord, we are the six Dukes-at-Arms of England. I am York.”\r\n\r\nThen each of the heralds, or Dukes-at-Arms, speaking in turn, proclaimed\r\nhis title.\r\n\r\n“I am Lancaster.”\r\n\r\n“I am Richmond.”\r\n\r\n“I am Chester.”\r\n\r\n“I am Somerset.”\r\n\r\n“I am Windsor.”\r\n\r\nThe coats of arms embroidered on their breasts were those of the\r\ncounties and towns from which they took their names.\r\n\r\nThe third rank, dressed in black, remained silent. Garter King-at-Arms,\r\npointing them out to Gwynplaine, said,--\r\n\r\n“My lord, these are the four Pursuivants-at-Arms. Blue Mantle.”\r\n\r\nThe man with the blue cape bowed.\r\n\r\n“Rouge Dragon.”\r\n\r\nHe with the St. George inclined his head.\r\n\r\n“Rouge Croix.”\r\n\r\nHe with the scarlet crosses saluted.\r\n\r\n“Portcullis.”\r\n\r\nHe with the sable fur collar made his obeisance.\r\n\r\nOn a sign from the King-at-Arms, the first of the pursuivants, Blue\r\nMantle, stepped forward and received from the officer of the Usher the\r\ncushion of silver cloth and crown-emblazoned portfolio. And the\r\nKing-at-Arms said to the Usher of the Black Rod,--\r\n\r\n“Proceed; I leave in your hands the introduction of his lordship!”\r\n\r\nThe observance of these customs, and also of others which will now be\r\ndescribed, were the old ceremonies in use prior to the time of Henry\r\nVIII., and which Anne for some time attempted to revive. There is\r\nnothing like it in existence now. Nevertheless, the House of Lords\r\nthinks that it is unchangeable; and, if Conservatism exists anywhere, it\r\nis there.\r\n\r\nIt changes, nevertheless. _E pur si muove_. For instance, what has\r\nbecome of the may-pole, which the citizens of London erected on the 1st\r\nof May, when the peers went down to the House? The last one was erected\r\nin 1713. Since then the may-pole has disappeared. Disuse.\r\n\r\nOutwardly, unchangeable; inwardly, mutable. Take, for example, the title\r\nof Albemarle. It sounds eternal. Yet it has been through six different\r\nfamilies--Odo, Mandeville, Bethune, Plantagenet, Beauchamp, Monck. Under\r\nthe title of Leicester five different names have been merged--Beaumont,\r\nBreose, Dudley, Sydney, Coke. Under Lincoln, six; under Pembroke, seven.\r\nThe families change, under unchanging titles. A superficial historian\r\nbelieves in immutability. In reality it does not exist. Man can never be\r\nmore than a wave; humanity is the ocean.\r\n\r\nAristocracy is proud of what women consider a reproach--age! Yet both\r\ncherish the same illusion, that they do not change. It is probable the\r\nHouse of Lords will not recognize itself in the foregoing description,\r\nnor yet in that which follows, thus resembling the once pretty woman,\r\nwho objects to having any wrinkles. The mirror is ever a scapegoat, yet\r\nits truths cannot be contested. To portray exactly, constitutes the duty\r\nof a historian. The King-at-Arms, turning to Gwynplaine, said,--\r\n\r\n“Be pleased to follow me, my lord.” And added, “You will be saluted.\r\nYour lordship, in returning the salute, will be pleased merely to raise\r\nthe brim of your hat.”\r\n\r\nThey moved off, in procession, towards a door at the far side of the\r\nroom. The Usher of the Black Rod walked in front; then Blue Mantle,\r\ncarrying the cushion; then the King-at-Arms; and after him came\r\nGwynplaine, wearing his hat. The rest, kings-at-arms, heralds, and\r\npursuivants, remained in the circular room. Gwynplaine, preceded by the\r\nUsher of the Black Rod, and escorted by the King-at-Arms, passed from\r\nroom to room, in a direction which it would now be impossible to trace,\r\nthe old Houses of Parliament having been pulled down. Amongst others, he\r\ncrossed that Gothic state chamber in which took place the last meeting\r\nof James II. and Monmouth, and whose walls witnessed the useless\r\ndebasement of the cowardly nephew at the feet of his vindictive uncle.\r\nOn the walls of this chamber hung, in chronological order, nine\r\nfell-length portraits of former peers, with their dates--Lord\r\nNansladron, 1305; Lord Baliol, 1306; Lord Benestede, 1314; Lord\r\nCantilupe, 1356; Lord Montbegon, 1357; Lord Tibotot, 1373; Lord Zouch of\r\nCodnor, 1615; Lord Bella-Aqua, with no date; Lord Harren and Surrey,\r\nCount of Blois, also without date.\r\n\r\nIt being now dark, lamps were burning at intervals in the galleries.\r\nBrass chandeliers, with wax candles, illuminated the rooms, lighting\r\nthem like the side aisles of a church. None but officials were present.\r\nIn one room, which the procession crossed, stood, with heads\r\nrespectfully lowered, the four clerks of the signet, and the Clerk of\r\nthe Council. In another room stood the distinguished Knight Banneret,\r\nPhilip Sydenham of Brympton in Somersetshire. The Knight Banneret is a\r\ntitle conferred in time of war, under the unfurled royal standard. In\r\nanother room was the senior baronet of England, Sir Edmund Bacon of\r\nSuffolk, heir of Sir Nicholas Bacon, styled, _Primus baronetorum\r\nAnglicæ_. Behind Sir Edmund was an armour-bearer with an arquebus, and\r\nan esquire carrying the arms of Ulster, the baronets being the\r\nhereditary defenders of the province of Ulster in Ireland. In another\r\nroom was the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with his four accountants, and\r\nthe two deputies of the Lord Chamberlain, _appointed to cleave the\r\ntallies_.[21]\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of a corridor covered with matting, which was the\r\ncommunication between the Lower and the Upper House, Gwynplaine was\r\nsaluted by Sir Thomas Mansell of Margam, Comptroller of the Queen’s\r\nHousehold and Member for Glamorgan; and at the exit from the corridor by\r\na deputation of one for every two of the Barons of the Cinque Ports,\r\nfour on the right and four on the left, the Cinque Ports being eight in\r\nnumber. William Hastings did obeisance for Hastings; Matthew Aylmor, for\r\nDover; Josias Burchett, for Sandwich; Sir Philip Boteler, for Hythe;\r\nJohn Brewer, for New Rumney; Edward Southwell, for the town of Rye;\r\nJames Hayes, for Winchelsea; George Nailor, for Seaford. As Gwynplaine\r\nwas about to return the salute, the King-at-Arms reminded him in a low\r\nvoice of the etiquette, “Only the brim of your hat, my lord.” Gwynplaine\r\ndid as directed. He now entered the so-called Painted Chamber, in which\r\nthere was no painting, except a few of saints, and amongst them St.\r\nEdward, in the high arches of the long and deep-pointed windows, which\r\nwere divided by what formed the ceiling of Westminster Hall and the\r\nfloor of the Painted Chamber. On the far side of the wooden barrier\r\nwhich divided the room from end to end, stood the three Secretaries of\r\nState, men of mark. The functions of the first of these officials\r\ncomprised the supervision of all affairs relating to the south of\r\nEngland, Ireland, the Colonies, France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain,\r\nPortugal, and Turkey. The second had charge of the north of England, and\r\nwatched affairs in the Low Countries, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Poland,\r\nand Russia. The third, a Scot, had charge of Scotland. The two\r\nfirst-mentioned were English, one of them being the Honourable Robert\r\nHarley, Member for the borough of New Radnor. A Scotch member, Mungo\r\nGraham, Esquire, a relation of the Duke of Montrose, was present. All\r\nbowed, without speaking, to Gwynplaine, who returned the salute by\r\ntouching his hat. The barrier-keeper lifted the wooden arm which,\r\npivoting on a hinge, formed the entrance to the far side of the Painted\r\nChamber, where stood the long table, covered with green cloth, reserved\r\nfor peers. A branch of lighted candles stood on the table. Gwynplaine,\r\npreceded by the Usher of the Black Rod, Garter King-at-Arms, and Blue\r\nMantle, penetrated into this privileged compartment. The barrier-keeper\r\nclosed the opening immediately Gwynplaine had passed. The King-at-Arms,\r\nhaving entered the precincts of the privileged compartment, halted. The\r\nPainted Chamber was a spacious apartment. At the farther end, upright,\r\nbeneath the royal escutcheon which was placed between the two windows,\r\nstood two old men, in red velvet robes, with two rows of ermine trimmed\r\nwith gold lace on their shoulders, and wearing wigs, and hats with\r\nwhite plumes. Through the openings of their robes might be detected silk\r\ngarments and sword hilts. Motionless behind them stood a man dressed in\r\nblack silk, holding on high a great mace of gold surmounted by a crowned\r\nlion. It was the Mace-bearer of the Peers of England. The lion is their\r\ncrest. _Et les Lions ce sont les Barons et li Per_, runs the manuscript\r\nchronicle of Bertrand Duguesclin.\r\n\r\nThe King-at-Arms pointed out the two persons in velvet, and whispered to\r\nGwynplaine,--\r\n\r\n“My lord, these are your equals. Be pleased to return their salute\r\nexactly as they make it. These two peers are barons, and have been named\r\nby the Lord Chancellor as your sponsors. They are very old, and almost\r\nblind. They will, themselves, introduce you to the House of Lords. The\r\nfirst is Charles Mildmay, Lord Fitzwalter, sixth on the roll of barons;\r\nthe second is Augustus Arundel, Lord Arundel of Trerice, thirty-eighth\r\non the roll of barons.” The King-at-Arms having advanced a step towards\r\nthe two old men, proclaimed “Fermain Clancharlie, Baron Clancharlie,\r\nBaron Hunkerville, Marquis of Corleone in Sicily, greets your\r\nlordships!” The two peers raised their hats to the full extent of the\r\narm, and then replaced them. Gwynplaine did the same. The Usher of the\r\nBlack Rod stepped forward, followed by Blue Mantle and Garter King\r\nat-Arms. The Mace-bearer took up his post in front of Gwynplaine, the\r\ntwo peers at his side, Lord Fitzwalter on the right, and Lord Arundel of\r\nTrerice on the left. Lord Arundel, the elder of the two, was very\r\nfeeble. He died the following year, bequeathing to his grandson John, a\r\nminor, the title which became extinct in 1768. The procession, leaving\r\nthe Painted Chamber, entered a gallery in which were rows of pilasters,\r\nand between the spaces were sentinels, alternately pike-men of England\r\nand halberdiers of Scotland. The Scotch halberdiers were magnificent\r\nkilted soldiers, worthy to encounter later on at Fontenoy the French\r\ncavalry, and the royal cuirassiers, whom their colonel thus addressed:\r\n“_Messieurs les maitres, assurez vos chapeaux. Nous allons avoir\r\nl’honneur de charger._” The captain of these soldiers saluted\r\nGwynplaine, and the peers, his sponsors, with their swords. The men\r\nsaluted with their pikes and halberds.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the gallery shone a large door, so magnificent that its\r\ntwo folds seemed to be masses of gold. On each side of the door there\r\nstood, upright and motionless, men who were called doorkeepers. Just\r\nbefore you came to this door, the gallery widened out into a circular\r\nspace. In this space was an armchair with an immense back, and on it,\r\njudging by his wig and from the amplitude of his robes, was a\r\ndistinguished person. It was William Cowper, Lord Chancellor of England.\r\nTo be able to cap a royal infirmity with a similar one has its\r\nadvantages. William Cowper was short-sighted. Anne had also defective\r\nsight, but in a lesser degree. The near-sightedness of William Cowper\r\nfound favour in the eyes of the short-sighted queen, and induced her to\r\nappoint him Lord Chancellor, and Keeper of the Royal Conscience. William\r\nCowper’s upper lip was thin, and his lower one thick--a sign of\r\nsemi-good-nature.\r\n\r\nThis circular space was lighted by a lamp hung from the ceiling. The\r\nLord Chancellor was sitting gravely in his large armchair; at his right\r\nwas the Clerk of the Crown, and at his left the Clerk of the\r\nParliaments.\r\n\r\nEach of the clerks had before him an open register and an inkhorn.\r\n\r\nBehind the Lord Chancellor was his mace-bearer, holding the mace with\r\nthe crown on the top, besides the train-bearer and purse-bearer, in\r\nlarge wigs.\r\n\r\nAll these officers are still in existence. On a little stand, near the\r\nwoolsack, was a sword, with a gold hilt and sheath, and belt of crimson\r\nvelvet.\r\n\r\nBehind the Clerk of the Crown was an officer holding in his hands the\r\ncoronation robe.\r\n\r\nBehind the Clerk of the Parliaments another officer held a second robe,\r\nwhich was that of a peer.\r\n\r\nThe robes, both of scarlet velvet, lined with white silk, and having\r\nbands of ermine trimmed with gold lace over the shoulders, were similar,\r\nexcept that the ermine band was wider on the coronation robe.\r\n\r\nThe third officer, who was the librarian, carried on a square of\r\nFlanders leather the red book, a little volume, bound in red morocco,\r\ncontaining a list of the peers and commons, besides a few blank leaves\r\nand a pencil, which it was the custom to present to each new member on\r\nhis entering the House.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, between the two peers, his sponsors, brought up the\r\nprocession, which stopped before the woolsack.\r\n\r\nThe two peers, who introduced him, uncovered their heads, and Gwynplaine\r\ndid likewise.\r\n\r\nThe King-at-Arms received from the hands of Blue Mantle the cushion of\r\nsilver cloth, knelt down, and presented the black portfolio on the\r\ncushion to the Lord Chancellor.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor took the black portfolio, and handed it to the Clerk\r\nof the Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk received it ceremoniously, and then sat down.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk of the Parliament opened the portfolio, and arose.\r\n\r\nThe portfolio contained the two usual messages--the royal patent\r\naddressed to the House of Lords, and the writ of summons.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk read aloud these two messages, with respectful deliberation,\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nThe writ of summons, addressed to Fermain Lord Clancharlie, concluded\r\nwith the accustomed formalities,--\r\n\r\n“We strictly enjoin you, on the faith and allegiance that you owe, to\r\ncome and take your place in person among the prelates and peers sitting\r\nin our Parliament at Westminster, for the purpose of giving your advice,\r\nin all honour and conscience, on the business of the kingdom and of the\r\nchurch.”\r\n\r\nThe reading of the messages being concluded, the Lord Chancellor raised\r\nhis voice,--\r\n\r\n“The message of the Crown has been read. Lord Clancharlie, does your\r\nlordship renounce transubstantiation, adoration of saints, and the\r\nmass?”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine bowed.\r\n\r\n“The test has been administered,” said the Lord Chancellor.\r\n\r\nAnd the Clerk of the Parliament resumed,--\r\n\r\n“His lordship has taken the test.”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor added,--\r\n\r\n“My Lord Clancharlie, you can take your seat.”\r\n\r\n“So be it,” said the two sponsors.\r\n\r\nThe King-at-Arms rose, took the sword from the stand, and buckled it\r\nround Gwynplaine’s waist.\r\n\r\n“Ce faict,” says the old Norman charter, “le pair prend son espée, et\r\nmonte aux hauts siéges, et assiste a l’audience.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine heard a voice behind him which said,--\r\n\r\n“I array your lordship in a peer’s robe.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the officer who spoke to him, who was holding the\r\nrobe, placed it on him, and tied the black strings of the ermine cape\r\nround his neck.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, the scarlet robe on his shoulders, and the golden sword by\r\nhis side, was attired like the peers on his right and left.\r\n\r\nThe librarian presented to him the red book, and put it in the pocket of\r\nhis waistcoat.\r\n\r\nThe King-at-Arms murmured in his ear,--\r\n\r\n“My lord, on entering, will bow to the royal chair.”\r\n\r\nThe royal chair is the throne.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the two clerks were writing, each at his table--one on the\r\nregister of the Crown, the other on the register of the House.\r\n\r\nThen both--the Clerk of the Crown preceding the other--brought their\r\nbooks to the Lord Chancellor, who signed them. Having signed the two\r\nregisters, the Lord Chancellor rose.\r\n\r\n“Fermain Lord Clancharlie, Baron Clancharlie, Baron Hunkerville, Marquis\r\nof Corleone in Sicily, be you welcome among your peers, the lords\r\nspiritual and temporal of Great Britain.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine’s sponsors touched his shoulder.\r\n\r\nHe turned round.\r\n\r\nThe folds of the great gilded door at the end of the gallery opened.\r\n\r\nIt was the door of the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nThirty-six hours only had elapsed since Gwynplaine, surrounded by a\r\ndifferent procession, had entered the iron door of Southwark Jail.\r\n\r\nWhat shadowy chimeras had passed, with terrible rapidity through his\r\nbrain--chimeras which were hard facts; rapidity, which was a capture by\r\nassault!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nIMPARTIALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe creation of an equality with the king, called Peerage, was, in\r\nbarbarous epochs, a useful fiction. This rudimentary political expedient\r\nproduced in France and England different results. In France, the peer\r\nwas a mock king; in England, a real prince--less grand than in France,\r\nbut more genuine: we might say less, but worse.\r\n\r\nPeerage was born in France; the date is uncertain--under Charlemagne,\r\nsays the legend; under Robert le Sage, says history, and history is not\r\nmore to be relied on than legend. Favin writes: “The King of France\r\nwished to attach to himself the great of his kingdom, by the magnificent\r\ntitle of peers, as if they were his equals.”\r\n\r\nPeerage soon thrust forth branches, and from France passed over to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe English peerage has been a great fact, and almost a mighty\r\ninstitution. It had for precedent the Saxon wittenagemote. The Danish\r\nthane and the Norman vavassour commingled in the baron. Baron is the\r\nsame as vir, which is translated into Spanish by _varon_, and which\r\nsignifies, _par excellence_, “Man.” As early as 1075, the barons made\r\nthemselves felt by the king--and by what a king! By William the\r\nConqueror. In 1086 they laid the foundation of feudality, and its basis\r\nwas the “Doomsday Book.” Under John Lackland came conflict. The French\r\npeerage took the high hand with Great Britain, and demanded that the\r\nking of England should appear at their bar. Great was the indignation of\r\nthe English barons. At the coronation of Philip Augustus, the King of\r\nEngland, as Duke of Normandy, carried the first square banner, and the\r\nDuke of Guyenne the second. Against this king, a vassal of the\r\nforeigner, the War of the Barons burst forth. The barons imposed on the\r\nweak-minded King John Magna Charta, from which sprang the House of\r\nLords. The pope took part with the king, and excommunicated the lords.\r\nThe date was 1215, and the pope was Innocent III., who wrote the “Veni,\r\nSancte Spiritus,” and who sent to John Lackland the four cardinal\r\nvirtues in the shape of four gold rings. The Lords persisted. The duel\r\ncontinued through many generations. Pembroke struggled. 1248 was the\r\nyear of “the provisions of Oxford.” Twenty-four barons limited the\r\nking’s powers, discussed him, and called a knight from each county to\r\ntake part in the widened breach. Here was the dawn of the Commons. Later\r\non, the Lords added two citizens from each city, and two burgesses from\r\neach borough. It arose from this, that up to the time of Elizabeth the\r\npeers were judges of the validity of elections to the House of Commons.\r\nFrom their jurisdiction sprang the proverb that the members returned\r\nought to be without the three P’s--_sine Prece, sine Pretio, sine\r\nPoculo_. This did not obviate rotten boroughs. In 1293, the Court of\r\nPeers in France had still the King of England under their jurisdiction;\r\nand Philippe le Bel cited Edward I. to appear before him. Edward I. was\r\nthe king who ordered his son to boil him down after death, and to carry\r\nhis bones to the wars. Under the follies of their kings the Lords felt\r\nthe necessity of fortifying Parliament. They divided it into two\r\nchambers, the upper and the lower. The Lords arrogantly kept the\r\nsupremacy. “If it happens that any member of the Commons should be so\r\nbold as to speak to the prejudice of the House of Lords, he is called to\r\nthe bar of the House to be reprimanded, and, occasionally, to be sent to\r\nthe Tower.” There is the same distinction in voting. In the House of\r\nLords they vote one by one, beginning with the junior, called the puisne\r\nbaron. Each peer answers “_Content_,” or “_Non-content_.” In the Commons\r\nthey vote together, by “Aye,” or “No,” in a crowd. The Commons accuse,\r\nthe peers judge. The peers, in their disdain of figures, delegated to\r\nthe Commons, who were to profit by it, the superintendence of the\r\nExchequer--thus named, according to some, after the table-cover, which\r\nwas like a chess-board; and according to others, from the drawers of the\r\nold safe, where was kept, behind an iron grating, the treasure of the\r\nkings of England. The “Year-Book” dates from the end of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. In the War of the Roses the weight of the Lords was thrown, now\r\non the side of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, now on the side of\r\nEdmund, Duke of York. Wat Tyler, the Lollards, Warwick the King-maker,\r\nall that anarchy from which freedom is to spring, had for foundation,\r\navowed or secret, the English feudal system. The Lords were usefully\r\njealous of the Crown; for to be jealous is to be watchful. They\r\ncircumscribed the royal initiative, diminished the category of cases of\r\nhigh treason, raised up pretended Richards against Henry IV., appointed\r\nthemselves arbitrators, judged the question of the three crowns between\r\nthe Duke of York and Margaret of Anjou, and at need levied armies, and\r\nfought their battles of Shrewsbury, Tewkesbury, and St. Albans,\r\nsometimes winning, sometimes losing. Before this, in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, they had gained the battle of Lewes, and had driven from the\r\nkingdom the four brothers of the king, bastards of Queen Isabella by\r\nthe Count de la Marche; all four usurers, who extorted money from\r\nChristians by means of the Jews; half princes, half sharpers--a thing\r\ncommon enough in more recent times, but not held in good odour in those\r\ndays. Up to the fifteenth century the Norman Duke peeped out in the King\r\nof England, and the acts of Parliament were written in French. From the\r\nreign of Henry VII., by the will of the Lords, these were written in\r\nEnglish. England, British under Uther Pendragon; Roman under Cæsar;\r\nSaxon under the Heptarchy; Danish under Harold; Norman after William;\r\nthen became, thanks to the Lords, English. After that she became\r\nAnglican. To have one’s religion at home is a great power. A foreign\r\npope drags down the national life. A Mecca is an octopus, and devours\r\nit. In 1534, London bowed out Rome. The peerage adopted the reformed\r\nreligion, and the Lords accepted Luther. Here we have the answer to the\r\nexcommunication of 1215. It was agreeable to Henry VIII.; but, in other\r\nrespects, the Lords were a trouble to him. As a bulldog to a bear, so\r\nwas the House of Lords to Henry VIII. When Wolsey robbed the nation of\r\nWhitehall, and when Henry robbed Wolsey of it, who complained? Four\r\nlords--Darcie, of Chichester; Saint John of Bletsho; and (two Norman\r\nnames) Mountjoie and Mounteagle. The king usurped. The peerage\r\nencroached. There is something in hereditary power which is\r\nincorruptible. Hence the insubordination of the Lords. Even in\r\nElizabeth’s reign the barons were restless. From this resulted the\r\ntortures at Durham. Elizabeth was as a farthingale over an executioner’s\r\nblock. Elizabeth assembled Parliament as seldom as possible, and reduced\r\nthe House of Lords to sixty-five members, amongst whom there was but one\r\nmarquis (Winchester), and not a single duke. In France the kings felt\r\nthe same jealousy and carried out the same elimination. Under Henry III.\r\nthere were no more than eight dukedoms in the peerage, and it was to the\r\ngreat vexation of the king that the Baron de Mantes, the Baron de\r\nCourcy, the Baron de Coulommiers, the Baron de Chateauneuf-en-Thimerais,\r\nthe Baron de la Fère-en-Lardenois, the Baron de Mortagne, and some\r\nothers besides, maintained themselves as barons--peers of France. In\r\nEngland the crown saw the peerage diminish with pleasure. Under Anne, to\r\nquote but one example, the peerages become extinct since the twelfth\r\ncentury amounted to five hundred and sixty-five. The War of the Roses\r\nhad begun the extermination of dukes, which the axe of Mary Tudor\r\ncompleted. This was, indeed, the decapitation of the nobility. To prune\r\naway the dukes was to cut off its head. Good policy, perhaps; but it is\r\nbetter to corrupt than to decapitate. James I. was of this opinion. He\r\nrestored dukedoms. He made a duke of his favourite Villiers, who had\r\nmade him a pig;[22] a transformation from the duke feudal to the duke\r\ncourtier. This sowing was to bring forth a rank harvest: Charles II. was\r\nto make two of his mistresses duchesses--Barbara of Southampton, and\r\nLouise de la Querouel of Portsmouth. Under Anne there were to be\r\ntwenty-five dukes, of whom three were to be foreigners, Cumberland,\r\nCambridge, and Schomberg. Did this court policy, invented by James I.,\r\nsucceed? No. The House of Peers was irritated by the effort to shackle\r\nit by intrigue. It was irritated against James I., it was irritated\r\nagainst Charles I., who, we may observe, may have had something to do\r\nwith the death of his father, just as Marie de Medicis may have had\r\nsomething to do with the death of her husband. There was a rupture\r\nbetween Charles I. and the peerage. The lords who, under James I., had\r\ntried at their bar extortion, in the person of Bacon, under Charles I.\r\ntried treason, in the person of Stratford. They had condemned Bacon;\r\nthey condemned Stratford. One had lost his honour, the other lost his\r\nlife. Charles I. was first beheaded in the person of Stratford. The\r\nLords lent their aid to the Commons. The king convokes Parliament to\r\nOxford; the revolution convokes it to London. Forty-four peers side with\r\nthe King, twenty-two with the Republic. From this combination of the\r\npeople with the Lords arose the Bill of Rights--a sketch of the French\r\n_Droits de l’homme_, a vague shadow flung back from the depths of\r\nfuturity by the revolution of France on the revolution of England.\r\n\r\nSuch were the services of the peerage. Involuntary ones, we admit, and\r\ndearly purchased, because the said peerage is a huge parasite. But\r\nconsiderable services, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nThe despotic work of Louis XI., of Richelieu, and of Louis XIV., the\r\ncreation of a sultan, levelling taken for true equality, the bastinado\r\ngiven by the sceptre, the common abasement of the people, all these\r\nTurkish tricks in France the peers prevented in England. The aristocracy\r\nwas a wall, banking up the king on one side, sheltering the people on\r\nthe other. They redeemed their arrogance towards the people by their\r\ninsolence towards the king. Simon, Earl of Leicester, said to Henry\r\nIII., “_King, thou hast lied_!” The Lords curbed the crown, and grated\r\nagainst their kings in the tenderest point, that of venery. Every lord,\r\npassing through a royal park, had the right to kill a deer: in the house\r\nof the king the peer was at home; in the Tower of London the scale of\r\nallowance for the king was no more than that for a peer--namely, twelve\r\npounds sterling per week. This was the House of Lords’ doing.\r\n\r\nYet more. We owe to it the deposition of kings. The Lords ousted John\r\nLackland, degraded Edward II., deposed Richard II., broke the power of\r\nHenry VI., and made Cromwell a possibility. What a Louis XIV. there was\r\nin Charles I.! Thanks to Cromwell, it remained latent. By-the-bye, we\r\nmay here observe that Cromwell himself, though no historian seems to\r\nhave noticed the fact, aspired to the peerage. This was why he married\r\nElizabeth Bouchier, descendant and heiress of a Cromwell, Lord Bouchier,\r\nwhose peerage became extinct in 1471, and of a Bouchier, Lord Robesart,\r\nanother peerage extinct in 1429. Carried on with the formidable increase\r\nof important events, he found the suppression of a king a shorter way to\r\npower than the recovery of a peerage. A ceremonial of the Lords, at\r\ntimes ominous, could reach even to the king. Two men-at-arms from the\r\nTower, with their axes on their shoulders, between whom an accused peer\r\nstood at the bar of the house, might have been there in like attendance\r\non the king as on any other nobleman. For five centuries the House of\r\nLords acted on a system, and carried it out with determination. They had\r\ntheir days of idleness and weakness, as, for instance, that strange time\r\nwhen they allowed themselves to be seduced by the vessels loaded with\r\ncheeses, hams, and Greek wines sent them by Julius II. The English\r\naristocracy was restless, haughty, ungovernable, watchful, and\r\npatriotically mistrustful. It was that aristocracy which, at the end of\r\nthe seventeenth century, by act the tenth of the year 1694, deprived the\r\nborough of Stockbridge, in Hampshire, of the right of sending members to\r\nParliament, and forced the Commons to declare null the election for\r\nthat borough, stained by papistical fraud. It imposed the test on James,\r\nDuke of York, and, on his refusal to take it, excluded him from the\r\nthrone. He reigned, notwithstanding; but the Lords wound up by calling\r\nhim to account and banishing him. That aristocracy has had, in its long\r\nduration, some instinct of progress. It has always given out a certain\r\nquantity of appreciable light, except now towards its end, which is at\r\nhand. Under James II. it maintained in the Lower House the proportion of\r\nthree hundred and forty-six burgesses against ninety-two knights. The\r\nsixteen barons, by courtesy, of the Cinque Ports were more than\r\ncounterbalanced by the fifty citizens of the twenty-five cities. Though\r\ncorrupt and egotistic, that aristocracy was, in some instances,\r\nsingularly impartial. It is harshly judged. History keeps all its\r\ncompliments for the Commons. The justice of this is doubtful. We\r\nconsider the part played by the Lords a very great one. Oligarchy is the\r\nindependence of a barbarous state, but it is an independence. Take\r\nPoland, for instance, nominally a kingdom, really a republic. The peers\r\nof England held the throne in suspicion and guardianship. Time after\r\ntime they have made their power more felt than that of the Commons. They\r\ngave check to the king. Thus, in that remarkable year, 1694, the\r\nTriennial Parliament Bill, rejected by the Commons, in consequence of\r\nthe objections of William III., was passed by the Lords. William III.,\r\nin his irritation, deprived the Earl of Bath of the governorship of\r\nPendennis Castle, and Viscount Mordaunt of all his offices. The House of\r\nLords was the republic of Venice in the heart of the royalty of England.\r\nTo reduce the king to a doge was its object; and in proportion as it\r\ndecreased the power of the crown it increased that of the people.\r\nRoyalty knew this, and hated the peerage. Each endeavoured to lessen the\r\nother. What was thus lost by each was proportionate profit to the\r\npeople. Those two blind powers, monarchy and oligarchy, could not see\r\nthat they were working for the benefit of a third, which was democracy.\r\nWhat a delight it was to the crown, in the last century, to be able to\r\nhang a peer, Lord Ferrers!\r\n\r\nHowever, they hung him with a silken rope. How polite!\r\n\r\n“They would not have hung a peer of France,” the Duke of Richelieu\r\nhaughtily remarked. Granted. They would have beheaded him. Still more\r\npolite!\r\n\r\nMontmorency Tancarville signed himself _peer of France and England_;\r\nthus throwing the English peerage into the second rank. The peers of\r\nFrance were higher and less powerful, holding to rank more than to\r\nauthority, and to precedence more than to domination. There was between\r\nthem and the Lords that shade of difference which separates vanity from\r\npride. With the peers of France, to take precedence of foreign princes,\r\nof Spanish grandees, of Venetian patricians; to see seated on the lower\r\nbenches the Marshals of France, the Constable and the Admiral of France,\r\nwere he even Comte de Toulouse and son of Louis XIV.; to draw a\r\ndistinction between duchies in the male and female line; to maintain the\r\nproper distance between a simple _comté_, like Armagnac or Albret, and a\r\n_comté pairie_, like Evreux; to wear by right, at five-and-twenty, the\r\nblue ribbon of the Golden Fleece; to counterbalance the Duke de la\r\nTremoille, the most ancient peer of the court, with the Duke Uzès, the\r\nmost ancient peer of the Parliament; to claim as many pages and horses\r\nto their carriages as an elector; to be called _monseigneur_ by the\r\nfirst President; to discuss whether the Duke de Maine dates his peerage\r\nas the Comte d’Eu, from 1458; to cross the grand chamber diagonally, or\r\nby the side--such things were grave matters. Grave matters with the\r\nLords were the Navigation Act, the Test Act, the enrolment of Europe in\r\nthe service of England, the command of the sea, the expulsion of the\r\nStuarts, war with France. On one side, etiquette above all; on the\r\nother, empire above all. The peers of England had the substance, the\r\npeers of France the shadow.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the House of Lords was a starting-point; towards\r\ncivilization this is an immense thing. It had the honour to found a\r\nnation. It was the first incarnation of the unity of the people: English\r\nresistance, that obscure but all-powerful force, was born in the House\r\nof Lords. The barons, by a series of acts of violence against royalty,\r\nhave paved the way for its eventual downfall. The House of Lords at the\r\npresent day is somewhat sad and astonished at what it has unwillingly\r\nand unintentionally done, all the more that it is irrevocable.\r\n\r\nWhat are concessions? Restitutions;--and nations know it.\r\n\r\n“I grant,” says the king.\r\n\r\n“I get back my own,” says the people.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords believed that it was creating the privileges of the\r\npeerage, and it has produced the rights of the citizen. That vulture,\r\naristocracy, has hatched the eagle’s egg of liberty.\r\n\r\nAnd now the egg is broken, the eagle is soaring, the vulture dying.\r\n\r\nAristocracy is at its last gasp; England is growing up.\r\n\r\nStill, let us be just towards the aristocracy. It entered the scale\r\nagainst royalty, and was its counterpoise. It was an obstacle to\r\ndespotism. It was a barrier. Let us thank and bury it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE OLD HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nNear Westminster Abbey was an old Norman palace which was burnt in the\r\ntime of Henry VIII. Its wings were spared. In one of them Edward VI.\r\nplaced the House of Lords, in the other the House of Commons. Neither\r\nthe two wings nor the two chambers are now in existence. The whole has\r\nbeen rebuilt.\r\n\r\nWe have already said, and we must repeat, that there is no resemblance\r\nbetween the House of Lords of the present day and that of the past. In\r\ndemolishing the ancient palace they somewhat demolished its ancient\r\nusages. The strokes of the pickaxe on the monument produce their\r\ncounter-strokes on customs and charters. An old stone cannot fall\r\nwithout dragging down with it an old law. Place in a round room a\r\nparliament which has been hitherto held in a square room, and it will no\r\nlonger be the same thing. A change in the shape of the shell changes the\r\nshape of the fish inside.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to preserve an old thing, human or divine, a code or a\r\ndogma, a nobility or a priesthood, never repair anything about it\r\nthoroughly, even its outside cover. Patch it up, nothing more. For\r\ninstance, Jesuitism is a piece added to Catholicism. Treat edifices as\r\nyou would treat institutions. Shadows should dwell in ruins. Worn-out\r\npowers are uneasy in chambers freshly decorated. Ruined palaces accord\r\nbest with institutions in rags. To attempt to describe the House of\r\nLords of other days would be to attempt to describe the unknown. History\r\nis night. In history there is no second tier. That which is no longer\r\non the stage immediately fades into obscurity. The scene is shifted, and\r\nall is at once forgotten. The past has a synonym, the unknown.\r\n\r\nThe peers of England sat as a court of justice in Westminster Hall, and\r\nas the higher legislative chamber in a chamber specially reserved for\r\nthe purpose, called _The House of Lords_.\r\n\r\nBesides the house of peers of England, which did not assemble as a court\r\nunless convoked by the crown, two great English tribunals, inferior to\r\nthe house of peers, but superior to all other jurisdiction, sat in\r\nWestminster Hall. At the end of that hall they occupied adjoining\r\ncompartments. The first was the Court of King’s Bench, in which the king\r\nwas supposed to preside; the second, the Court of Chancery, in which the\r\nChancellor presided. The one was a court of justice, the other a court\r\nof mercy. It was the Chancellor who counselled the king to pardon; only\r\nrarely, though.\r\n\r\nThese two courts, which are still in existence, interpreted legislation,\r\nand reconstructed it somewhat, for the art of the judge is to carve the\r\ncode into jurisprudence; a task from which equity results as it best\r\nmay. Legislation was worked up and applied in the severity of the great\r\nhall of Westminster, the rafters of which were of chestnut wood, over\r\nwhich spiders could not spread their webs. There are enough of them in\r\nall conscience in the laws.\r\n\r\nTo sit as a court and to sit as a chamber are two distinct things. This\r\ndouble function constitutes supreme power. The Long Parliament, which\r\nbegan in November 1640, felt the revolutionary necessity for this\r\ntwo-edged sword. So it declared that, as House of Lords, it possessed\r\njudicial as well as legislative power.\r\n\r\nThis double power has been, from time immemorial, vested in the House of\r\nPeers. We have just mentioned that as judges they occupied Westminster\r\nHall; as legislators, they had another chamber. This other chamber,\r\nproperly called the House of Lords, was oblong and narrow. All the light\r\nin it came from four windows in deep embrasures, which received their\r\nlight through the roof, and a bull’s-eye, composed of six panes with\r\ncurtains, over the throne. At night there was no other light than twelve\r\nhalf candelabra, fastened to the wall. The chamber of Venice was darker\r\nstill. A certain obscurity is pleasing to those owls of supreme power.\r\n\r\nA high ceiling adorned with many-faced relievos and gilded cornices,\r\ncircled over the chamber where the Lords assembled. The Commons had but\r\na flat ceiling. There is a meaning in all monarchical buildings. At one\r\nend of the long chamber of the Lords was the door; at the other,\r\nopposite to it, the throne. A few paces from the door, the bar, a\r\ntransverse barrier, and a sort of frontier, marked the spot where the\r\npeople ended and the peerage began. To the right of the throne was a\r\nfireplace with emblazoned pinnacles, and two bas-reliefs of marble,\r\nrepresenting, one, the victory of Cuthwolf over the Britons, in 572; the\r\nother, the geometrical plan of the borough of Dunstable, which had four\r\nstreets, parallel to the four quarters of the world. The throne was\r\napproached by three steps. It was called the royal chair. On the two\r\nwalls, opposite each other, were displayed in successive pictures, on a\r\nhuge piece of tapestry given to the Lords by Elizabeth, the adventures\r\nof the Armada, from the time of its leaving Spain until it was wrecked\r\non the coasts of Great Britain. The great hulls of the ships were\r\nembroidered with threads of gold and silver, which had become blackened\r\nby time. Against this tapestry, cut at intervals by the candelabra\r\nfastened in the wall, were placed, to the right of the throne, three\r\nrows of benches for the bishops, and to the left three rows of benches\r\nfor the dukes, marquises, and earls, in tiers, and separated by\r\ngangways. On the three benches of the first section sat the dukes; on\r\nthose of the second, the marquises; on those of the third, the earls.\r\nThe viscounts’ bench was placed across, opposite the throne, and behind,\r\nbetween the viscounts and the bar, were two benches for the barons.\r\n\r\nOn the highest bench to the right of the throne sat the two archbishops\r\nof Canterbury and York; on the middle bench three bishops, London,\r\nDurham, and Winchester, and the other bishops on the lowest bench. There\r\nis between the Archbishop of Canterbury and the other bishops this\r\nconsiderable difference, that he is bishop “by divine providence,”\r\nwhilst the others are only so “by divine permission.” On the right of\r\nthe throne was a chair for the Prince of Wales, and on the left, folding\r\nchairs for the royal dukes, and behind the latter, a raised seat for\r\nminor peers, who had not the privilege of voting. Plenty of\r\nfleurs-de-lis everywhere, and the great escutcheon of England over the\r\nfour walls, above the peers, as well as above the king.\r\n\r\nThe sons of peers and the heirs to peerages assisted at the debates,\r\nstanding behind the throne, between the daïs and the wall. A large\r\nsquare space was left vacant between the tiers of benches placed along\r\nthree sides of the chamber and the throne. In this space, which was\r\ncovered with the state carpet, interwoven with the arms of Great\r\nBritain, were four woolsacks--one in front of the throne, on which sat\r\nthe Lord Chancellor, between the mace and the seal; one in front of the\r\nbishops, on which sat the judges, counsellors of state, who had the\r\nright to vote, but not to speak; one in front of the dukes, marquises,\r\nand earls, on which sat the Secretaries of State; and one in front of\r\nthe viscounts and barons, on which sat the Clerk of the Crown and the\r\nClerk of the Parliament, and on which the two under-clerks wrote,\r\nkneeling.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the space was a large covered table, heaped with\r\nbundles of papers, registers, and summonses, with magnificent inkstands\r\nof chased silver, and with high candlesticks at the four corners.\r\n\r\nThe peers took their seats in chronological order, each according to the\r\ndate of the creation of his peerage. They ranked according to their\r\ntitles, and within their grade of nobility according to seniority. At\r\nthe bar stood the Usher of the Black Rod, his wand in his hand. Inside\r\nthe door was the Deputy-Usher; and outside, the Crier of the Black Rod,\r\nwhose duty it was to open the sittings of the Courts of Justice with the\r\ncry, “Oyez!” in French, uttered thrice, with a solemn accent upon the\r\nfirst syllable. Near the Crier stood the Serjeant Mace-Bearer of the\r\nChancellor.\r\n\r\nIn royal ceremonies the temporal peers wore coronets on their heads, and\r\nthe spiritual peers, mitres. The archbishops wore mitres, with a ducal\r\ncoronet; and the bishops, who rank after viscounts, mitres, with a\r\nbaron’s cap.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked, as a coincidence at once strange and instructive,\r\nthat this square formed by the throne, the bishops, and the barons, with\r\nkneeling magistrates within it, was in form similar to the ancient\r\nparliament in France under the two first dynasties. The aspect of\r\nauthority was the same in France as in England. Hincmar, in his\r\ntreatise, “De Ordinatione Sacri Palatii,” described in 853 the sittings\r\nof the House of Lords at Westminster in the eighteenth century. Strange,\r\nindeed! a description given nine hundred years before the existence of\r\nthe thing described.\r\n\r\nBut what is history? An echo of the past in the future; a reflex from\r\nthe future on the past.\r\n\r\nThe assembly of Parliament was obligatory only once in every seven\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe Lords deliberated in secret, with closed doors. The debates of the\r\nCommons were public. Publicity entails diminution of dignity.\r\n\r\nThe number of the Lords was unlimited. To create Lords was the menace of\r\nroyalty; a means of government.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the eighteenth century the House of Lords already\r\ncontained a very large number of members. It has increased still further\r\nsince that period. To dilute the aristocracy is politic. Elizabeth most\r\nprobably erred in condensing the peerage into sixty-five lords. The less\r\nnumerous, the more intense is a peerage. In assemblies, the more\r\nnumerous the members, the fewer the heads. James II. understood this\r\nwhen he increased the Upper House to a hundred and eighty-eight lords; a\r\nhundred and eighty-six if we subtract from the peerages the two duchies\r\nof royal favourites, Portsmouth and Cleveland. Under Anne the total\r\nnumber of the lords, including bishops, was two hundred and seven. Not\r\ncounting the Duke of Cumberland, husband of the queen, there were\r\ntwenty-five dukes, of whom the premier, Norfolk, did not take his seat,\r\nbeing a Catholic; and of whom the junior, Cambridge, the Elector of\r\nHanover, did, although a foreigner. Winchester, termed first and sole\r\nmarquis of England, as Astorga was termed sole Marquis of Spain, was\r\nabsent, being a Jacobite; so that there were only five marquises, of\r\nwhom the premier was Lindsay, and the junior Lothian; seventy-nine\r\nearls, of whom Derby was premier and Islay junior; nine viscounts, of\r\nwhom Hereford was premier and Lonsdale junior; and sixty-two barons, of\r\nwhom Abergavenny was premier and Hervey junior. Lord Hervey, the junior\r\nbaron, was what was called the “Puisné of the House.” Derby, of whom\r\nOxford, Shrewsbury, and Kent took precedence, and who was therefore but\r\nthe fourth under James II., became (under Anne) premier earl. Two\r\nchancellors’ names had disappeared from the list of barons--Verulam,\r\nunder which designation history finds us Bacon; and Wem, under which it\r\nfinds us Jeffreys. Bacon and Jeffreys! both names overshadowed, though\r\nby different crimes. In 1705, the twenty-six bishops were reduced to\r\ntwenty-five, the see of Chester being vacant. Amongst the bishops some\r\nwere peers of high rank, such as William Talbot, Bishop of Oxford, who\r\nwas head of the Protestant branch of that family. Others were eminent\r\nDoctors, like John Sharp, Archbishop of York, formerly Dean of Norwich;\r\nthe poet, Thomas Spratt, Bishop of Rochester, an apoplectic old man; and\r\nthat Bishop of Lincoln, who was to die Archbishop of Canterbury, Wake,\r\nthe adversary of Bossuet. On important occasions, and when a message\r\nfrom the Crown to the House was expected, the whole of this august\r\nassembly--in robes, in wigs, in mitres, or plumes--formed out, and\r\ndisplayed their rows of heads, in tiers, along the walls of the House,\r\nwhere the storm was vaguely to be seen exterminating the Armada--almost\r\nas much as to say, “The storm is at the orders of England.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE OLD CHAMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole ceremony of the investiture of Gwynplaine, from his entry\r\nunder the King’s Gate to his taking the test under the nave window, was\r\nenacted in a sort of twilight.\r\n\r\nLord William Cowper had not permitted that he, as Lord Chancellor of\r\nEngland, should receive too many details of circumstances connected with\r\nthe disfigurement of the young Lord Fermain Clancharlie, considering it\r\nbelow his dignity to know that a peer was not handsome; and feeling that\r\nhis dignity would suffer if an inferior should venture to intrude on him\r\ninformation of such a nature. We know that a common fellow will take\r\npleasure in saying, “That prince is humpbacked;” therefore, it is\r\nabusive to say that a lord is deformed. To the few words dropped on the\r\nsubject by the queen the Lord Chancellor had contented himself with\r\nreplying, “The face of a peer is in his peerage!”\r\n\r\nUltimately, however, the affidavits he had read and certified\r\nenlightened him. Hence the precautions which he took. The face of the\r\nnew lord, on his entrance into the House, might cause some sensation.\r\nThis it was necessary to prevent; and the Lord Chancellor took his\r\nmeasures for the purpose. It is a fixed idea, and a rule of conduct in\r\ngrave personages, to allow as little disturbance as possible. Dislike of\r\nincident is a part of their gravity. He felt the necessity of so\r\nordering matters that the admission of Gwynplaine should take place\r\nwithout any hitch, and like that of any other successor to the peerage.\r\n\r\nIt was for this reason that the Lord Chancellor directed that the\r\nreception of Lord Fermain Clancharlie should take place at the evening\r\nsitting. The Chancellor being the doorkeeper--“_Quodammodo ostiarus_,”\r\nsays the Norman charter; “_Januarum cancellorumque_,” says\r\nTertullian--he can officiate outside the room on the threshold; and Lord\r\nWilliam Cowper had used his right by carrying out under the nave the\r\nformalities of the investiture of Lord Fermain Clancharlie. Moreover, he\r\nhad brought forward the hour for the ceremonies; so that the new peer\r\nactually made his entrance into the House before the House had\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\nFor the investiture of a peer on the threshold, and not in the chamber\r\nitself, there were precedents. The first hereditary baron, John de\r\nBeauchamp, of Holt Castle, created by patent by Richard II., in 1387,\r\nBaron Kidderminster, was thus installed. In renewing this precedent the\r\nLord Chancellor was creating for himself a future cause for\r\nembarrassment, of which he felt the inconvenience less than two years\r\nafterwards on the entrance of Viscount Newhaven into the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nShort-sighted as we have already stated him to be, Lord William Cowper\r\nscarcely perceived the deformity of Gwynplaine; while the two sponsors,\r\nbeing old and nearly blind, did not perceive it at all.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor had chosen them for that very reason.\r\n\r\nMore than this, the Lord Chancellor, having only seen the presence and\r\nstature of Gwynplaine, thought him a fine-looking man. When the\r\ndoor-keeper opened the folding doors to Gwynplaine there were but few\r\npeers in the house; and these few were nearly all old men. In assemblies\r\nthe old members are the most punctual, just as towards women they are\r\nthe most assiduous.\r\n\r\nOn the dukes’ benches there were but two, one white-headed, the other\r\ngray--Thomas Osborne, Duke of Leeds, and Schomberg, son of that\r\nSchomberg, German by birth, French by his marshal’s bâton, and English\r\nby his peerage, who was banished by the edict of Nantes, and who, having\r\nfought against England as a Frenchman, fought against France as an\r\nEnglishman. On the benches of the lords spiritual there sat only the\r\nArchbishopof Canterbury, Primate of England, above; and below, Dr. Simon\r\nPatrick, Bishop of Ely, in conversation with Evelyn Pierrepoint, Marquis\r\nof Dorchester, who was explaining to him the difference between a gabion\r\nconsidered singly and when used in the parapet of a field work, and\r\nbetween palisades and fraises; the former being a row of posts driven\r\ninfo the ground in front of the tents, for the purpose of protecting the\r\ncamp; the latter sharp-pointed stakes set up under the wall of a\r\nfortress, to prevent the escalade of the besiegers and the desertion of\r\nthe besieged; and the marquis was explaining further the method of\r\nplacing fraises in the ditches of redoubts, half of each stake being\r\nburied and half exposed. Thomas Thynne, Viscount Weymouth, having\r\napproached the light of a chandelier, was examining a plan of his\r\narchitect’s for laying out his gardens at Longleat, in Wiltshire, in the\r\nItalian style--as a lawn, broken up into plots, with squares of turf\r\nalternating with squares of red and yellow sand, of river shells, and of\r\nfine coal dust. On the viscounts’ benches was a group of old peers,\r\nEssex, Ossulstone, Peregrine, Osborne, William Zulestein, Earl of\r\nRochford, and amongst them, a few more youthful ones, of the faction\r\nwhich did not wear wigs, gathered round Prince Devereux, Viscount\r\nHereford, and discussing the question whether an infusion of apalaca\r\nholly was tea. “Very nearly,” said Osborne. “Quite,” said Essex. This\r\ndiscussion was attentively listened to by Paulet St. John, a cousin of\r\nBolingbroke, of whom Voltaire was, later on, in some degree the pupil;\r\nfor Voltaire’s education, commenced by Père Porée, was finished by\r\nBolingbroke. On the marquises’ benches, Thomas de Grey, Marquis of Kent,\r\nLord Chamberlain to the Queen, was informing Robert Bertie, Marquis of\r\nLindsay, Lord Chamberlain of England, that the first prize in the great\r\nEnglish lottery of 1694 had been won by two French refugees, Monsieur Le\r\nCoq, formerly councillor in the parliament of Paris, and Monsieur\r\nRavenel, a gentleman of Brittany. The Earl of Wemyss was reading a book,\r\nentitled “Pratique Curieuse des Oracles des Sybilles.” John Campbell,\r\nEarl of Greenwich, famous for his long chin, his gaiety, and his\r\neighty-seven years, was writing to his mistress. Lord Chandos was\r\ntrimming his nails.\r\n\r\nThe sitting which was about to take place, being a royal one, where the\r\ncrown was to be represented by commissioners, two assistant door-keepers\r\nwere placing in front of the throne a bench covered with purple velvet.\r\nOn the second woolsack sat the Master of the Rolls, _sacrorum scriniorum\r\nmagister_, who had then for his residence the house formerly belonging\r\nto the converted Jews. Two under-clerks were kneeling, and turning over\r\nthe leaves of the registers which lay on the fourth woolsack. In the\r\nmeantime the Lord Chancellor took his place on the first woolsack. The\r\nmembers of the chamber took theirs, some sitting, others standing; when\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury rose and read the prayer, and the sitting\r\nof the house began.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine had already been there for some time without attracting any\r\nnotice. The second bench of barons, on which was his place, was close to\r\nthe bar, so that he had had to take but a few steps to reach it. The two\r\npeers, his sponsors, sat, one on his right, the other on his left, thus\r\nalmost concealing the presence of the new-comer.\r\n\r\nNo one having been furnished with any previous information, the Clerk of\r\nthe Parliament had read in a low voice, and as it were, mumbled through\r\nthe different documents concerning the new peer, and the Lord Chancellor\r\nhad proclaimed his admission in the midst of what is called, in the\r\nreports, “general inattention.” Every one was talking. There buzzed\r\nthrough the House that cheerful hum of voices during which assemblies\r\npass things which will not bear the light, and at which they wonder when\r\nthey find out what they have done, too late.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine was seated in silence, with his head uncovered, between the\r\ntwo old peers, Lord Fitzwalter and Lord Arundel. On entering, according\r\nto the instructions of the King-at-Arms--afterwards renewed by his\r\nsponsors--he had bowed to the throne.\r\n\r\nThus all was over. He was a peer. That pinnacle, under the glory of\r\nwhich he had, all his life, seen his master, Ursus, bow himself down in\r\nfear--that prodigious pinnacle was under his feet. He was in that place,\r\nso dark and yet so dazzling in England. Old peak of the feudal mountain,\r\nlooked up to for six centuries by Europe and by history! Terrible\r\nnimbus of a world of shadow! He had entered into the brightness of its\r\nglory, and his entrance was irrevocable.\r\n\r\nHe was there in his own sphere, seated on his throne, like the king on\r\nhis. He was there and nothing in the future could obliterate the fact.\r\nThe royal crown, which he saw under the daïs, was brother to his\r\ncoronet. He was a peer of that throne. In the face of majesty he was\r\npeerage; less, but like. Yesterday, what was he? A player. To-day, what\r\nwas he? A prince.\r\n\r\nYesterday, nothing; to-day, everything.\r\n\r\nIt was a sudden confrontation of misery and power, meeting face to face,\r\nand resolving themselves at once into the two halves of a conscience.\r\nTwo spectres, Adversity and Prosperity, were taking possession of the\r\nsame soul, and each drawing that soul towards itself.\r\n\r\nOh, pathetic division of an intellect, of a will, of a brain, between\r\ntwo brothers who are enemies! the Phantom of Poverty and the Phantom of\r\nWealth! Abel and Cain in the same man!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nARISTOCRATIC GOSSIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy degrees the seats of the House filled as the Lords arrived. The\r\nquestion was the vote for augmenting, by a hundred thousand pounds\r\nsterling, the annual income of George of Denmark, Duke of Cumberland,\r\nthe queen’s husband. Besides this, it was announced that several bills\r\nassented to by her Majesty were to be brought back to the House by the\r\nCommissioners of the Crown empowered and charged to sanction them. This\r\nraised the sitting to a royal one. The peers all wore their robes over\r\ntheir usual court or ordinary dress. These robes, similar to that which\r\nhad been thrown over Gwynplaine, were alike for all, excepting that the\r\ndukes had five bands of ermine, trimmed with gold; marquises, four;\r\nearls and viscounts, three; and barons, two. Most of the lords entered\r\nin groups. They had met in the corridors, and were continuing the\r\nconversations there begun. A few came in alone. The costumes of all were\r\nsolemn; but neither their attitudes nor their words corresponded with\r\nthem. On entering, each one bowed to the throne.\r\n\r\nThe peers flowed in. The series of great names marched past with scant\r\nceremonial, the public not being present. Leicester entered, and shook\r\nLichfield’s hand; then came Charles Mordaunt, Earl of Peterborough and\r\nMonmouth, the friend of Locke, under whose advice he had proposed the\r\nrecoinage of money; then Charles Campbell, Earl of Loudoun, listening to\r\nFulke Greville, Lord Brooke; then Dorme, Earl of Carnarvon; then Robert\r\nSutton, Baron Lexington, son of that Lexington who recommended Charles\r\nII. to banish Gregorio Leti, the historiographer, who was so ill-advised\r\nas to try to become a historian; then Thomas Bellasys, Viscount\r\nFalconberg, a handsome old man; and the three cousins, Howard, Earl of\r\nBindon, Bowes Howard, Earl of Berkshire, and Stafford Howard, Earl of\r\nStafford--all together; then John Lovelace, Baron Lovelace, which\r\npeerage became extinct in 1736, so that Richardson was enabled to\r\nintroduce Lovelace in his book, and to create a type under the name. All\r\nthese personages--celebrated each in his own way, either in politics or\r\nin war, and of whom many were an honour to England--were laughing and\r\ntalking.\r\n\r\nIt was history, as it were, seen in undress.\r\n\r\nIn less than half an hour the House was nearly full. This was to be\r\nexpected, as the sitting was a royal one. What was more unusual was the\r\neagerness of the conversations. The House, so sleepy not long before,\r\nnow hummed like a hive of bees.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the peers who had come in late had wakened them up. These\r\nlords had brought news. It was strange that the peers who had been there\r\nat the opening of the sitting knew nothing of what had occurred, while\r\nthose who had not been there knew all about it. Several lords had come\r\nfrom Windsor.\r\n\r\nFor some hours past the adventures of Gwynplaine had been the subject of\r\nconversation. A secret is a net; let one mesh drop, and the whole goes\r\nto pieces. In the morning, in consequence of the incidents related\r\nabove, the whole story of a peer found on the stage, and of a mountebank\r\nbecome a lord, had burst forth at Windsor in Royal places. The princes\r\nhad talked about it, and then the lackeys. From the Court the news soon\r\nreached the town. Events have a weight, and the mathematical rule of\r\nvelocity, increasing in proportion to the squares of the distance,\r\napplies to them. They fall upon the public, and work themselves through\r\nit with the most astounding rapidity. At seven o’clock no one in London\r\nhad caught wind of the story; by eight Gwynplaine was the talk of the\r\ntown. Only the lords who had been so punctual that they were present\r\nbefore the assembling of the House were ignorant of the circumstances,\r\nnot having been in the town when the matter was talked of by every one,\r\nand having been in the House, where nothing had been perceived. Seated\r\nquietly on their benches, they were addressed by the eager newcomers.\r\n\r\n“Well!” said Francis Brown, Viscount Montacute, to the Marquis of\r\nDorchester.\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“The Laughing Man!”\r\n\r\n“Who is the Laughing Man?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you know the Laughing Man?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“He is a clown, a fellow performing at fairs. He has an extraordinary\r\nface, which people gave a penny to look at. A mountebank.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what then?”\r\n\r\n“You have just installed him as a peer of England.”\r\n\r\n“You are the laughing man, my Lord Montacute!”\r\n\r\n“I am not laughing, my Lord Dorchester.”\r\n\r\nLord Montacute made a sign to the Clerk of the Parliament, who rose from\r\nhis woolsack, and confirmed to their lordships the fact of the admission\r\nof the new peer. Besides, he detailed the circumstances.\r\n\r\n“How wonderful!” said Lord Dorchester. “I was talking to the Bishop of\r\nEly all the while.”\r\n\r\nThe young Earl of Annesley addressed old Lord Eure, who had but two\r\nyears more to live, as he died in 1707.\r\n\r\n“My Lord Eure.”\r\n\r\n“My Lord Annesley.”\r\n\r\n“Did you know Lord Linnæus Clancharlie?”\r\n\r\n“A man of bygone days. Yes I did.”\r\n\r\n“He died in Switzerland?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; we were relations.”\r\n\r\n“He was a republican under Cromwell, and remained a republican under\r\nCharles II.?”\r\n\r\n“A republican? Not at all! He was sulking. He had a personal quarrel\r\nwith the king. I know from good authority that Lord Clancharlie would\r\nhave returned to his allegiance, if they had given him the office of\r\nChancellor, which Lord Hyde held.”\r\n\r\n“You astonish me, Lord Eure. I had heard that Lord Clancharlie was an\r\nhonest politician.”\r\n\r\n“An honest politician! does such a thing exist? Young man, there is no\r\nsuch thing.”\r\n\r\n“And Cato?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you believe in Cato, do you?”\r\n\r\n“And Aristides?”\r\n\r\n“They did well to exile him.”\r\n\r\n“And Thomas More?”\r\n\r\n“They did well to cut off his head.”\r\n\r\n“And in your opinion Lord Clancharlie was a man as you describe. As for\r\na man remaining in exile, why, it is simply ridiculous.”\r\n\r\n“He died there.”\r\n\r\n“An ambitious man disappointed?”\r\n\r\n“You ask if I knew him? I should think so indeed. I was his dearest\r\nfriend.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know, Lord Eure, that he married when in Switzerland?”\r\n\r\n“I am pretty sure of it.”\r\n\r\n“And that he had a lawful heir by that marriage?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; who is dead.”\r\n\r\n“Who is living.”\r\n\r\n“Living?”\r\n\r\n“Living.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible!”\r\n\r\n“It is a fact--proved, authenticated, confirmed, registered.”\r\n\r\n“Then that son will inherit the Clancharlie peerage?”\r\n\r\n“He is not going to inherit it.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because he has inherited it. It is done.”\r\n\r\n“Done?”\r\n\r\n“Turn your head, Lord Eure; he is sitting behind you, on the barons’\r\nbenches.”\r\n\r\nLord Eure turned, but Gwynplaine’s face was concealed under his forest\r\nof hair.\r\n\r\n“So,” said the old man, who could see nothing but his hair, “he has\r\nalready adopted the new fashion. He does not wear a wig.”\r\n\r\nGrantham accosted Colepepper.\r\n\r\n“Some one is finely sold.”\r\n\r\n“Who is that?”\r\n\r\n“David Dirry-Moir.”\r\n\r\n“How is that?”\r\n\r\n“He is no longer a peer.”\r\n\r\n“How can that be?”\r\n\r\nAnd Henry Auverquerque, Earl of Grantham, told John Baron Colepepper the\r\nwhole anecdote--how the waif-flask had been carried to the Admiralty,\r\nabout the parchment of the Comprachicos, the _jussu regis_,\r\ncountersigned _Jeffreys_, and the confrontation in the torture-cell at\r\nSouthwark, the proof of all the facts acknowledged by the Lord\r\nChancellor and by the Queen; the taking the test under the nave, and\r\nfinally the admission of Lord Fermain Clancharlie at the commencement of\r\nthe sitting. Both the lords endeavoured to distinguish his face as he\r\nsat between Lord Fitzwalter and Lord Arundel, but with no better success\r\nthan Lord Eure and Lord Annesley.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, either by chance or by the arrangement of his sponsors,\r\nforewarned by the Lord Chancellor, was so placed in shadow as to escape\r\ntheir curiosity.\r\n\r\n“Who is it? Where is he?”\r\n\r\nSuch was the exclamation of all the new-comers, but no one succeeded in\r\nmaking him out distinctly. Some, who had seen Gwynplaine in the Green\r\nBox, were exceedingly curious, but lost their labour: as it sometimes\r\nhappens that a young lady is entrenched within a troop of dowagers,\r\nGwynplaine was, as it were, enveloped in several layers of lords, old,\r\ninfirm, and indifferent. Good livers, with the gout, are marvellously\r\nindifferent to stories about their neighbours.\r\n\r\nThere passed from hand to hand copies of a letter three lines in length,\r\nwritten, it was said, by the Duchess Josiana to the queen, her sister,\r\nin answer to the injunction made by her Majesty, that she should espouse\r\nthe new peer, the lawful heir of the Clancharlies, Lord Fermain. This\r\nletter was couched in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n“MADAM,--The arrangement will suit me just as well. I can have Lord\r\nDavid for my lover.--(Signed) JOSIANA.”\r\n\r\nThis note, whether a true copy or a forgery, was received by all with\r\nthe greatest enthusiasm. A young lord, Charles Okehampton, Baron Mohun,\r\nwho belonged to the wigless faction, read and re-read it with delight.\r\nLewis de Duras, Earl of Faversham, an Englishman with a Frenchman’s wit,\r\nlooked at Mohun and smiled.\r\n\r\n“That is a woman I should like to marry!” exclaimed Lord Mohun.\r\n\r\nThe lords around them overheard the following dialogue between Duras and\r\nMohun:--\r\n\r\n“Marry the Duchess Josiana, Lord Mohun!”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Plague take it.”\r\n\r\n“She would make one very happy.”\r\n\r\n“She would make many very happy.”\r\n\r\n“But is it not always a question of many?”\r\n\r\n“Lord Mohun, you are right. With regard to women, we have always the\r\nleavings of others. Has any one ever had a beginning?”\r\n\r\n“Adam, perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“Not he.”\r\n\r\n“Then Satan.”\r\n\r\n“My dear lord,” concluded Lewis de Duras, “Adam only lent his name. Poor\r\ndupe! He endorsed the human race. Man was begotten on the woman by the\r\ndevil.”\r\n\r\nHugh Cholmondeley, Earl of Cholmondeley, strong in points of law, was\r\nasked from the bishops’ benches by Nathaniel Crew, who was doubly a\r\npeer, being a temporal peer, as Baron Crew, and a spiritual peer, as\r\nBishop of Durham.\r\n\r\n“Is it possible?” said Crew.\r\n\r\n“Is it regular?” said Cholmondeley.\r\n\r\n“The investiture of this peer was made outside the House,” replied the\r\nbishop; “but it is stated that there are precedents for it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Lord Beauchamp, under Richard II.; Lord Chenay, under Elizabeth:\r\nand Lord Broghill, under Cromwell.”\r\n\r\n“Cromwell goes for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“What do you think of it all?”\r\n\r\n“Many different things.”\r\n\r\n“My Lord Cholmondeley, what will be the rank of this young Lord\r\nClancharlie in the House?”\r\n\r\n“My Lord Bishop, the interruption of the Republic having displaced\r\nancient rights of precedence, Clancharlie now ranks in the peerage\r\nbetween Barnard and Somers, so that should each be called upon to speak\r\nin turn, Lord Clancharlie would be the eighth in rotation.”\r\n\r\n“Really! he--a mountebank from a public show!”\r\n\r\n“The act, _per se_, does not astonish me, my Lord Bishop. We meet with\r\nsuch things. Still more wonderful circumstances occur. Was not the War\r\nof the Roses predicted by the sudden drying up of the river Ouse, in\r\nBedfordshire, on January 1st, 1399. Now, if a river dries up, a peer\r\nmay, quite as naturally, fall into a servile condition. Ulysses, King of\r\nIthaca, played all kinds of different parts. Fermain Clancharlie\r\nremained a lord under his player’s garb. Sordid garments touch not the\r\nsoul’s nobility. But taking the test and the investiture outside the\r\nsitting, though strictly legal, might give rise to objections. I am of\r\nopinion that it will be necessary to look into the matter, to see if\r\nthere be any ground to question the Lord Chancellor in Privy Council\r\nlater on. We shall see in a week or two what is best to be done.”\r\n\r\nAnd the Bishop added,--\r\n\r\n“All the same. It is an adventure such as has not occurred since Earl\r\nGesbodus’s time.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, the Laughing Man; the Tadcaster Inn; the Green Box; “Chaos\r\nVanquished;” Switzerland; Chillon; the Comprachicos; exile; mutilation;\r\nthe Republic; Jeffreys; James II.; the _jussu regis_; the bottle opened\r\nat the Admiralty; the father, Lord Linnæus; the legitimate son, Lord\r\nFermain; the bastard son, Lord David; the probable lawsuits; the Duchess\r\nJosiana; the Lord Chancellor; the Queen;--all these subjects of\r\nconversation ran from bench to bench.\r\n\r\nWhispering is like a train of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nThey seized on every incident. All the details of the occurrence caused\r\nan immense murmur through the House. Gwynplaine, wandering in the depths\r\nof his reverie, heard the buzzing, without knowing that he was the cause\r\nof it. He was strangely attentive to the depths, not to the surface.\r\nExcess of attention becomes isolation.\r\n\r\nThe buzz of conversation in the House impedes its usual business no more\r\nthan the dust raised by a troop impedes its march. The judges--who in\r\nthe Upper House were mere assistants, without the privilege of\r\nspeaking, except when questioned--had taken their places on the second\r\nwoolsack; and the three Secretaries of State theirs on the third.\r\n\r\nThe heirs to peerages flowed into their compartment, at once without and\r\nwithin the House, at the back of the throne.\r\n\r\nThe peers in their minority were on their own benches. In 1705 the\r\nnumber of these little lords amounted to no less than a\r\ndozen--Huntingdon, Lincoln, Dorset, Warwick, Bath, Barlington,\r\nDerwentwater--destined to a tragical death--Longueville, Lonsdale,\r\nDudley, Ward, and Carteret: a troop of brats made up of eight earls, two\r\nviscounts, and two barons.\r\n\r\nIn the centre, on the three stages of benches, each lord had taken his\r\nseat. Almost all the bishops were there. The dukes mustered strong,\r\nbeginning with Charles Seymour, Duke of Somerset; and ending with George\r\nAugustus, Elector of Hanover, and Duke of Cambridge, junior in date of\r\ncreation, and consequently junior in rank. All were in order, according\r\nto right of precedence: Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire, whose grandfather\r\nhad sheltered Hobbes, at Hardwicke, when he was ninety-two; Lennox, Duke\r\nof Richmond; the three Fitzroys, the Duke of Southampton, the Duke of\r\nGrafton, and the Duke of Northumberland; Butler, Duke of Ormond;\r\nSomerset, Duke of Beaufort; Beauclerk, Duke of St. Albans; Paulet, Duke\r\nof Bolton; Osborne, Duke of Leeds; Wrottesley Russell, Duke of Bedford,\r\nwhose motto and device was _Che sarà sarà_, which expresses a\r\ndetermination to take things as they come; Sheffield, Duke of\r\nBuckingham; Manners, Duke of Rutland; and others. Neither Howard, Duke\r\nof Norfolk, nor Talbot, Duke of Shrewsbury, was present, being\r\nCatholics; nor Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, the French Malbrouck, who\r\nwas at that time fighting the French and beating them. There were no\r\nScotch dukes then--Queensberry, Montrose, and Roxburgh not being\r\nadmitted till 1707.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE HIGH AND THE LOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll at once a bright light broke upon the House. Four doorkeepers\r\nbrought and placed on each side of the throne four high candelabra\r\nfilled with wax-lights. The throne, thus illuminated, shone in a kind\r\nof purple light. It was empty but august. The presence of the queen\r\nherself could not have added much majesty to it.\r\n\r\nThe Usher of the Black Rod entered with his wand and announced,--\r\n\r\n“The Lords Commissioners of her Majesty.”\r\n\r\nThe hum of conversation immediately subsided.\r\n\r\nA clerk, in a wig and gown, appeared at the great door, holding a\r\ncushion worked with _fleurs de lis_, on which lay parchment documents.\r\nThese documents were bills. From each hung the _bille_, or _bulle_, by a\r\nsilken string, from which laws are called bills in England and bulls at\r\nRome. Behind the clerk walked three men in peers’ robes, and wearing\r\nplumed hats.\r\n\r\nThese were the Royal Commissioners. The first was the Lord High\r\nTreasurer of England, Godolphin; the second, the Lord President of the\r\nCouncil, Pembroke; the third, the Lord of the Privy Seal, Newcastle.\r\n\r\nThey walked one by one, according to precedence, not of their rank, but\r\nof their commission--Godolphin first, Newcastle last, although a duke.\r\n\r\nThey reached the bench in front of the throne, to which they bowed, took\r\noff and replaced their hats, and sat down on the bench.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor turned towards the Usher of the Black Rod, and\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n“Order the Commons to the bar of the House.”\r\n\r\nThe Usher of the Black Rod retired.\r\n\r\nThe clerk, who was one of the clerks of the House of Lords, placed on\r\nthe table, between the four woolsacks, the cushion on which lay the\r\nbills.\r\n\r\nThen there came an interruption, which continued for some minutes.\r\n\r\nTwo doorkeepers placed before the bar a stool with three steps.\r\n\r\nThis stool was covered with crimson velvet, on which _fleurs de lis_\r\nwere designed in gilt nails.\r\n\r\nThe great door, which had been closed, was reopened; and a voice\r\nannounced,--\r\n\r\n“The faithful Commons of England.”\r\n\r\nIt was the Usher of the Black Rod announcing the other half of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThe lords put on their hats.\r\n\r\nThe members of the House of Commons entered, preceded by their Speaker,\r\nall with uncovered heads.\r\n\r\nThey stopped at the bar. They were in their ordinary garb; for the most\r\npart dressed in black, and wearing swords. The Speaker, the Right\r\nHonourable John Smith, an esquire, member for the borough of Andover,\r\ngot up on the stool which was at the centre of the bar. The Speaker of\r\nthe Commons wore a robe of black satin, with large hanging sleeves,\r\nembroidered before and behind with brandenburgs of gold, and a wig\r\nsmaller than that of the Lord Chancellor. He was majestic, but inferior.\r\n\r\nThe Commons, both Speaker and members, stood waiting with uncovered\r\nheads, before the peers, who were seated, with their hats on.\r\n\r\nAmongst the members of Commons might have been remarked the\r\nChief Justice of Chester, Joseph Jekyll; the Queen’s three\r\nSerjeants-at-Law--Hooper, Powys, and Parker; James Montagu,\r\nSolicitor-General; and the Attorney-General, Simon Harcourt. With\r\nthe exception of a few baronets and knights, and nine lords by\r\ncourtesy--Hartington, Windsor, Woodstock, Mordaunt, Granby, Scudamore,\r\nFitzharding, Hyde, and Berkeley--sons of peers and heirs to\r\npeerages--all were of the people, a sort of gloomy and silent crowd.\r\n\r\nWhen the noise made by the trampling of feet had ceased, the Crier of\r\nthe Black Rod, standing by the door, exclaimed:--\r\n\r\n“Oyez!”\r\n\r\nThe Clerk of the Crown arose. He took, unfolded, and read the first of\r\nthe documents on the cushion. It was a message from the Queen, naming\r\nthree commissioners to represent her in Parliament, with power to\r\nsanction the bills.\r\n\r\n“To wit--”\r\n\r\nHere the Clerk raised his voice.\r\n\r\n“Sidney Earl Godolphin.”\r\n\r\nThe Clerk bowed to Lord Godolphin. Lord Godolphin raised his hat.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk continued,--\r\n\r\n“Thomas Herbert, Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery.”\r\n\r\nThe Clerk bowed to Lord Pembroke. Lord Pembroke touched his hat.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk resumed,--\r\n\r\n“John Holles, Duke of Newcastle.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle nodded.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk of the Crown resumed his seat.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk of the Parliaments arose. His under-clerk, who had been on his\r\nknees behind him, got up also. Both turned their faces to the throne,\r\nand their backs to the Commons.\r\n\r\nThere were five bills on the cushion. These five bills, voted by the\r\nCommons and agreed to by the Lords, awaited the royal sanction.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk of the Parliaments read the first bill.\r\n\r\nIt was a bill passed by the Commons, charging the country with the costs\r\nof the improvements made by the Queen to her residence at Hampton Court,\r\namounting to a million sterling.\r\n\r\nThe reading over, the Clerk bowed low to the throne. The under-clerk\r\nbowed lower still; then, half turning his head towards the Commons, he\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n“The Queen accepts your bounty--_et ainsi le veut_.”\r\n\r\nThe Clerk read the second bill.\r\n\r\nIt was a law condemning to imprisonment and fine whosoever withdrew\r\nhimself from the service of the trainbands. The trainbands were a\r\nmilitia, recruited from the middle and lower classes, serving gratis,\r\nwhich in Elizabeth’s reign furnished, on the approach of the Armada, one\r\nhundred and eighty-five thousand foot-soldiers and forty thousand horse.\r\n\r\nThe two clerks made a fresh bow to the throne, after which the\r\nunder-clerk, again half turning his face to the Commons, said,--\r\n\r\n“_La Reine le veut_.”\r\n\r\nThe third bill was for increasing the tithes and prebends of the\r\nBishopric of Lichfield and Coventry, which was one of the richest in\r\nEngland; for making an increased yearly allowance to the cathedral, for\r\naugmenting the number of its canons, and for increasing its deaneries\r\nand benefices, “to the benefit of our holy religion,” as the preamble\r\nset forth. The fourth bill added to the budget fresh taxes--one on\r\nmarbled paper; one on hackney coaches, fixed at the number of eight\r\nhundred in London, and taxed at a sum equal to fifty-two francs yearly\r\neach; one on barristers, attorneys, and solicitors, at forty-eight\r\nfrancs a year a head; one on tanned skins, notwithstanding, said the\r\npreamble, the complaints of the workers in leather; one on soap,\r\nnotwithstanding the petitions of the City of Exeter and of the whole of\r\nDevonshire, where great quantities of cloth and serge were manufactured;\r\none on wine at four shillings; one on flour; one on barley and hops; and\r\none renewing for four years “the necessities of the State,” said the\r\npreamble, “requiring to be attended to before the remonstrances of\r\ncommerce”--tonnage-dues, varying from six francs per ton, for ships\r\ncoming from the westward, to eighteen francs on those coming from the\r\neastward. Finally, the bill, declaring the sums already levied for the\r\ncurrent year insufficient, concluded by decreeing a poll-tax on each\r\nsubject throughout the kingdom of four shillings per head, adding that a\r\ndouble tax would be levied on every one who did not take the fresh oath\r\nto Government. The fifth bill forbade the admission into the hospital of\r\nany sick person who on entering did not deposit a pound sterling to pay\r\nfor his funeral, in case of death. These last three bills, like the\r\nfirst two, were one after the other sanctioned and made law by a bow to\r\nthe throne, and the four words pronounced by the under-clerk, “_la Reine\r\nle veut_,” spoken over his shoulder to the Commons. Then the under-clerk\r\nknelt down again before the fourth woolsack, and the Lord Chancellor\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n“_Soit fait comme il est désiré_.”\r\n\r\nThis terminated the royal sitting. The Speaker, bent double before the\r\nChancellor, descended from the stool, backwards, lifting up his robe\r\nbehind him; the members of the House of Commons bowed to the ground, and\r\nas the Upper House resumed the business of the day, heedless of all\r\nthese marks of respect, the Commons departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSTORMS OF MEN ARE WORSE THAN STORMS OF OCEANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doors were closed again, the Usher of the Black Rod re-entered; the\r\nLords Commissioners left the bench of State, took their places at the\r\ntop of the dukes’ benches, by right of their commission, and the Lord\r\nChancellor addressed the House:--\r\n\r\n“My Lords, the House having deliberated for several days on the Bill\r\nwhich proposes to augment by £100,000 sterling the annual provision for\r\nhis Royal Highness the Prince, her Majesty’s Consort, and the debate\r\nhaving been exhausted and closed, the House will proceed to vote; the\r\nvotes will be taken according to custom, beginning with the puisne\r\nBaron. Each Lord, on his name being called, will rise and answer\r\n_content_, or _non-content_, and will be at liberty to explain the\r\nmotives of his vote, if he thinks fit to do so.--Clerk, take the vote.”\r\n\r\nThe Clerk of the House, standing up, opened a large folio, and spread it\r\nopen on a gilded desk. This book was the list of the Peerage.\r\n\r\nThe puisne of the House of Lords at that time was John Hervey, created\r\nBaron and Peer in 1703, from whom is descended the Marquis of Bristol.\r\n\r\nThe clerk called,--\r\n\r\n“My Lord John, Baron Hervey.”\r\n\r\nAn old man in a fair wig rose, and said, “Content.”\r\n\r\nThen he sat down.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk registered his vote.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk continued,--\r\n\r\n“My Lord Francis Seymour, Baron Conway, of Killultagh.”\r\n\r\n“Content,” murmured, half rising, an elegant young man, with a face like\r\na page, who little thought that he was to be ancestor to the Marquises\r\nof Hertford.\r\n\r\n“My Lord John Leveson, Baron Gower,” continued the Clerk.\r\n\r\nThis Baron, from whom were to spring the Dukes of Sutherland, rose, and,\r\nas he reseated himself, said “Content.”\r\n\r\nThe Clerk went on.\r\n\r\n“My Lord Heneage Finch, Baron Guernsey.”\r\n\r\nThe ancestor of the Earls of Aylesford, neither older nor less elegant\r\nthan the ancestor of the Marquises of Hertford, justified his device,\r\n_Aperto vivere voto_, by the proud tone in which he exclaimed,\r\n“Content.”\r\n\r\nWhilst he was resuming his seat, the Clerk called the fifth Baron,--\r\n\r\n“My Lord John, Baron Granville.”\r\n\r\nRising and resuming his seat quickly, “Content,” exclaimed Lord\r\nGranville, of Potheridge, whose peerage was to become extinct in 1709.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk passed to the sixth.\r\n\r\n“My Lord Charles Montague, Baron Halifax.”\r\n\r\n“Content,” said Lord Halifax, the bearer of a title which had become\r\nextinct in the Saville family, and was destined to become extinct again\r\nin that of Montague. Montague is distinct from Montagu and Montacute.\r\nAnd Lord Halifax added, “Prince George has an allowance as Her Majesty’s\r\nConsort; he has another as Prince of Denmark; another as Duke of\r\nCumberland; another as Lord High Admiral of England and Ireland; but he\r\nhas not one as Commander-in-Chief. This is an injustice and a wrong\r\nwhich must be set right, in the interest of the English people.”\r\n\r\nThen Lord Halifax passed a eulogium on the Christian religion, abused\r\npopery, and voted the subsidy.\r\n\r\nLord Halifax sat down, and the Clerk resumed,--\r\n\r\n“My Lord Christopher, Baron Barnard.”\r\n\r\nLord Barnard, from whom were to descend the Dukes of Cleveland, rose to\r\nanswer to his name.\r\n\r\n“Content.”\r\n\r\nHe took some time in reseating himself, for he wore a lace band which\r\nwas worth showing. For all that, Lord Barnard was a worthy gentleman and\r\na brave officer.\r\n\r\nWhile Lord Barnard was resuming his seat, the Clerk, who read by\r\nroutine, hesitated for an instant; he readjusted his spectacles, and\r\nleaned over the register with renewed attention; then, lifting up his\r\nhead, he said,--\r\n\r\n“My Lord Fermain Clancharlie, Baron Clancharlie and Hunkerville.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine arose.\r\n\r\n“Non-content,” said he.\r\n\r\nEvery face was turned towards him. Gwynplaine remained standing. The\r\nbranches of candles, placed on each side of the throne, lighted up his\r\nfeatures, and marked them against the darkness of the august chamber in\r\nthe relief with which a mask might show against a background of smoke.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine had made that effort over himself which, it may be\r\nremembered, was possible to him in extremity. By a concentration of will\r\nequal to that which would be needed to cow a tiger, he had succeeded in\r\nobliterating for a moment the fatal grin upon his face. For an instant\r\nhe no longer laughed. This effort could not last long. Rebellion against\r\nthat which is our law or our fatality must be short-lived; at times the\r\nwaters of the sea resist the power of gravitation, swell into a\r\nwaterspout and become a mountain, but only on the condition of falling\r\nback again.\r\n\r\nSuch a struggle was Gwynplaine’s. For an instant, which he felt to be a\r\nsolemn one, by a prodigious intensity of will, but for not much longer\r\nthan a flash of lightning lasts, he had thrown over his brow the dark\r\nveil of his soul--he held in suspense his incurable laugh. From that\r\nface upon which it had been carved he had withdrawn the joy. Now it was\r\nnothing but terrible.\r\n\r\n“Who is this man?” exclaimed all.\r\n\r\nThat forest of hair, those dark hollows under the brows, the deep gaze\r\nof eyes which they could not see, that head, on the wild outlines of\r\nwhich light and darkness mingled weirdly, were a wonder indeed. It was\r\nbeyond all understanding; much as they had heard of him, the sight of\r\nGwynplaine was a terror. Even those who expected much found their\r\nexpectations surpassed. It was as though on the mountain reserved for\r\nthe gods, during the banquet on a serene evening, the whole of the\r\nall-powerful body being gathered together, the face of Prometheus,\r\nmangled by the vulture’s beak, should have suddenly appeared before\r\nthem, like a blood-coloured moon on the horizon. Olympus looking on\r\nCaucasus! What a vision! Old and young, open-mouthed with surprise,\r\nfixed their eyes upon Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nAn old man, respected by the whole House, who had seen many men and many\r\nthings, and who was intended for a dukedom--Thomas, Earl of\r\nWharton--rose in terror.\r\n\r\n“What does all this mean?” he cried. “Who has brought this man into the\r\nHouse? Let him be put out.”\r\n\r\nAnd addressing Gwynplaine haughtily,--\r\n\r\n“Who are you? Whence do you come?”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine answered,--\r\n\r\n“Out of the depths.”\r\n\r\nAnd folding his arms, he looked at the lords.\r\n\r\n“Who am I? I am wretchedness. My lords, I have a word to say to you.”\r\n\r\nA shudder ran through the House. Then all was silence. Gwynplaine\r\ncontinued,--\r\n\r\n“My lords, you are highly placed. It is well. We must believe that God\r\nhas His reasons that it should be so. You have power, opulence,\r\npleasure, the sun ever shining in your zenith; authority unbounded,\r\nenjoyment without a sting, and a total forgetfulness of others. So be\r\nit. But there is something below you--above you, it may be. My lords, I\r\nbring you news--news of the existence of mankind.”\r\n\r\nAssemblies are like children. A strange occurrence is as a\r\nJack-in-the-Box to them. It frightens them; but they like it. It is as\r\nif a spring were touched and a devil jumps up. Mirabeau, who was also\r\ndeformed, was a case in point in France.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine felt within himself, at that moment, a strange elevation. In\r\naddressing a body of men, one’s foot seems to rest on them; to rest, as\r\nit were, on a pinnacle of souls--on human hearts, that quiver under\r\none’s heel. Gwynplaine was no longer the man who had been, only the\r\nnight before, almost mean. The fumes of the sudden elevation which had\r\ndisturbed him had cleared off and become transparent, and in the state\r\nin which Gwynplaine had been seduced by a vanity he now saw but a duty.\r\nThat which had at first lessened now elevated him. He was illuminated by\r\none of those great flashes which emanate from duty.\r\n\r\nAll round Gwynplaine arose cries of “Hear, hear!”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, rigid and superhuman, he succeeded in maintaining on his\r\nfeatures that severe and sad contraction under which the laugh was\r\nfretting like a wild horse struggling to escape.\r\n\r\nHe resumed,--\r\n\r\n“I am he who cometh out of the depths. My lords, you are great and rich.\r\nThere lies your danger. You profit by the night; but beware! The dawn is\r\nall-powerful. You cannot prevail over it. It is coming. Nay! it is come.\r\nWithin it is the day-spring of irresistible light. And who shall hinder\r\nthat sling from hurling the sun into the sky? The sun I speak of is\r\nRight. You are Privilege. Tremble! The real master of the house is about\r\nto knock at the door. What is the father of Privilege? Chance. What is\r\nhis son? Abuse. Neither Chance nor Abuse are abiding. For both a dark\r\nmorrow is at hand. I am come to warn you. I am come to impeach your\r\nhappiness. It is fashioned out of the misery of your neighbour. You have\r\neverything, and that everything is composed of the nothing of others. My\r\nlords, I am an advocate without hope, pleading a cause that is lost; but\r\nthat cause God will gain on appeal. As for me, I am but a voice. Mankind\r\nis a mouth, of which I am the cry. You shall hear me! I am about to\r\nopen before you, peers of England, the great assize of the people; of\r\nthat sovereign who is the subject; of that criminal who is the judge. I\r\nam weighed down under the load of all that I have to say. Where am I to\r\nbegin? I know not. I have gathered together, in the vast diffusion of\r\nsuffering, my innumerable and scattered pleas. What am I to do with them\r\nnow? They overwhelm me, and I must cast them to you in a confused mass.\r\nDid I foresee this? No. You are astonished. So am I. Yesterday I was a\r\nmountebank; to-day I am a peer. Deep play. Of whom? Of the Unknown. Let\r\nus all tremble. My lords, all the blue sky is for you. Of this immense\r\nuniverse you see but the sunshine. Believe me, it has its shadows.\r\nAmongst you I am called Lord Fermain Clancharlie; but my true name is\r\none of poverty--Gwynplaine. I am a wretched thing carved out of the\r\nstuff of which the great are made, for such was the pleasure of a king.\r\nThat is my history. Many amongst you knew my father. I knew him not. His\r\nconnection with you was his feudal descent; his outlawry is the bond\r\nbetween him and me. What God willed was well. I was cast into the abyss.\r\nFor what end? To search its depths. I am a diver, and I have brought\r\nback the pearl, truth. I speak, because I know. You shall hear me, my\r\nlords. I have seen, I have felt! Suffering is not a mere word, ye happy\r\nones! Poverty I grew up in; winter has frozen me; hunger I have tasted;\r\ncontempt I have suffered; pestilence I have undergone; shame I have\r\ndrunk of. And I will vomit all these up before you, and this ejection of\r\nall misery shall sully your feet and flame about them. I hesitated\r\nbefore I allowed myself to be brought to the place where I now stand,\r\nbecause I have duties to others elsewhere, and my heart is not here.\r\nWhat passed within me has nothing to do with you. When the man whom you\r\ncall Usher of the Black Rod came to seek me by order of the woman whom\r\nyou call the Queen, the idea struck me for a moment that I would refuse\r\nto come. But it seemed to me that the hidden hand of God pressed me to\r\nthe spot, and I obeyed. I felt that I must come amongst you. Why?\r\nBecause of my rags of yesterday. It is to raise my voice among those who\r\nhave eaten their fill that God mixed me up with the famished. Oh, have\r\npity! Of this fatal world to which you believe yourselves to belong you\r\nknow nothing. Placed so high, you are out of it. But I will tell you\r\nwhat it is. I have had experience enough. I come from beneath the\r\npressure of your feet. I can tell you your weight. Oh, you who are\r\nmasters, do you know what you are? do you see what you are doing? No.\r\nOh, it is dreadful! One night, one night of storm, a little deserted\r\nchild, an orphan alone in the immeasurable creation, I made my entrance\r\ninto that darkness which you call society. The first thing that I saw\r\nwas the law, under the form of a gibbet; the second was riches, your\r\nriches, under the form of a woman dead of cold and hunger; the third,\r\nthe future, under the form of a child left to die; the fourth, goodness,\r\ntruth, and justice, under the figure of a vagabond, whose sole friend\r\nand companion was a wolf.”\r\n\r\nJust then Gwynplaine, stricken by a sudden emotion, felt the sobs rising\r\nin his throat, causing him, most unfortunately, to burst into an\r\nuncontrollable fit of laughter.\r\n\r\nThe contagion was immediate. A cloud had hung over the assembly. It\r\nmight have broken into terror; it broke into delight. Mad merriment\r\nseized the whole House. Nothing pleases the great chambers of sovereign\r\nman so much as buffoonery. It is their revenge upon their graver\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\nThe laughter of kings is like the laughter of the gods. There is always\r\na cruel point in it. The lords set to play. Sneers gave sting to their\r\nlaughter. They clapped their hands around the speaker, and insulted him.\r\nA volley of merry exclamations assailed him like bright but wounding\r\nhailstones.\r\n\r\n“Bravo, Gwynplaine!”--“Bravo, Laughing Man!”--“Bravo, Snout of the Green\r\nBox!”--“Mask of Tarrinzeau Field!”--“You are going to give us a\r\nperformance.”--“That’s right; talk away!”--“There’s a funny\r\nfellow!”--“How the beast does laugh, to be sure!”--“Good-day,\r\npantaloon!”--“How d’ye do, my lord clown!”--“Go on with your\r\nspeech!”--“That fellow a peer of England?”--“Go on!”--“No, no!”--“Yes,\r\nyes!”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor was much disturbed.\r\n\r\nA deaf peer, James Butler, Duke of Ormond, placing his hand to his ear\r\nlike an ear trumpet, asked Charles Beauclerk, Duke of St. Albans,--\r\n\r\n“How has he voted?”\r\n\r\n“Non-content.”\r\n\r\n“By heavens!” said Ormond, “I can understand it, with such a face as\r\nhis.”\r\n\r\nDo you think that you can ever recapture a crowd once it has escaped\r\nyour grasp? And all assemblies are crowds alike. No, eloquence is a bit;\r\nand if the bit breaks, the audience runs away, and rushes on till it has\r\nthrown the orator. Hearers naturally dislike the speaker, which is a\r\nfact not as clearly understood as it ought to be. Instinctively he pulls\r\nthe reins, but that is a useless expedient. However, all orators try it,\r\nas Gwynplaine did.\r\n\r\nHe looked for a moment at those men who were laughing at him. Then he\r\ncried,--\r\n\r\n“So, you insult misery! Silence, Peers of England! Judges, listen to my\r\npleading! Oh, I conjure you, have pity. Pity for whom? Pity for\r\nyourselves. Who is in danger? Yourselves! Do you not see that you are in\r\na balance, and that there is in one scale your power, and in the other\r\nyour responsibility? It is God who is weighing you. Oh, do not laugh.\r\nThink. The trembling of your consciences is the oscillation of the\r\nbalance in which God is weighing your actions. You are not wicked; you\r\nare like other men, neither better nor worse. You believe yourselves to\r\nbe gods; but be ill to-morrow, and see your divinity shivering in fever!\r\nWe are worth one as much as the other. I address myself to honest men;\r\nthere are such here. I address myself to lofty intellects; there are\r\nsuch here. I address myself to generous souls; there are such here. You\r\nare fathers, sons, and brothers; therefore you are often touched. He\r\namongst you who has this morning watched the awaking of his little child\r\nis a good man. Hearts are all alike. Humanity is nothing but a heart.\r\nBetween those who oppress and those who are oppressed there is but a\r\ndifference of place. Your feet tread on the heads of men. The fault is\r\nnot yours; it is that of the social Babel. The building is faulty, and\r\nout of the perpendicular. One floor bears down the other. Listen, and I\r\nwill tell you what to do. Oh! as you are powerful, be brotherly; as you\r\nare great, be tender. If you only knew what I have seen! Alas, what\r\ngloom is there beneath! The people are in a dungeon. How many are\r\ncondemned who are innocent! No daylight, no air, no virtue! They are\r\nwithout hope, and yet--there is the danger--they expect something.\r\nRealize all this misery. There are beings who live in death. There are\r\nlittle girls who at twelve begin by prostitution, and who end in old age\r\nat twenty. As to the severities of the criminal code, they are fearful.\r\nI speak somewhat at random, and do not pick my words. I say everything\r\nthat comes into my head. No later than yesterday I who stand here saw a\r\nman lying in chains, naked, with stones piled on his chest, expire in\r\ntorture. Do you know of these things? No. If you knew what goes on, you\r\nwould not dare to be happy. Who of you have been to Newcastle-upon-Tyne?\r\nThere, in the mines, are men who chew coals to fill their stomachs and\r\ndeceive hunger. Look here! in Lancashire, Ribblechester has sunk, by\r\npoverty, from a town to a village. I do not see that Prince George of\r\nDenmark requires a hundred thousand pounds extra. I should prefer\r\nreceiving a poor sick man into the hospital, without compelling him to\r\npay his funeral expenses in advance. In Carnarvon, and at Strathmore, as\r\nwell as at Strathbickan, the exhaustion of the poor is horrible. At\r\nStratford they cannot drain the marsh for want of money. The\r\nmanufactories are shut up all over Lancashire. There is forced idleness\r\neverywhere. Do you know that the herring fishers at Harlech eat grass\r\nwhen the fishery fails? Do you know that at Burton-Lazars there are\r\nstill lepers confined, on whom they fire if they leave their tan houses!\r\nAt Ailesbury, a town of which one of you is lord, destitution is\r\nchronic. At Penkridge, in Coventry, where you have just endowed a\r\ncathedral and enriched a bishop, there are no beds in the cabins, and\r\nthey dig holes in the earth in which to put the little children to lie,\r\nso that instead of beginning life in the cradle, they begin it in the\r\ngrave. I have seen these things! My lords, do you know who pays the\r\ntaxes you vote? The dying! Alas! you deceive yourselves. You are going\r\nthe wrong road. You augment the poverty of the poor to increase the\r\nriches of the rich. You should do the reverse. What! take from the\r\nworker to give to the idle, take from the tattered to give to the\r\nwell-clad; take from the beggar to give to the prince! Oh yes! I have\r\nold republican blood in my veins. I have a horror of these things. How I\r\nexecrate kings! And how shameless are the women! I have been told a sad\r\nstory. How I hate Charles II.! A woman whom my father loved gave herself\r\nto that king whilst my father was dying in exile. The prostitute!\r\nCharles II., James II.! After a scamp, a scoundrel. What is there in a\r\nking? A man, feeble and contemptible, subject to wants and infirmities.\r\nOf what good is a king? You cultivate that parasite royalty; you make a\r\nserpent of that worm, a dragon of that insect. O pity the poor! You\r\nincrease the weight of the taxes for the profit of the throne. Look to\r\nthe laws which you decree. Take heed of the suffering swarms which you\r\ncrush. Cast your eyes down. Look at what is at your feet. O ye great,\r\nthere are the little. Have pity! yes, have pity on yourselves; for the\r\npeople is in its agony, and when the lower part of the trunk dies, the\r\nhigher parts die too. Death spares no limb. When night comes no one can\r\nkeep his corner of daylight. Are you selfish? then save others. The\r\ndestruction of the vessel cannot be a matter of indifference to any\r\npassenger. There can be no wreck for some that is not wreck for all. O\r\nbelieve it, the abyss yawns for all!”\r\n\r\nThe laughter increased, and became irresistible. For that matter, such\r\nextravagance as there was in his words was sufficient to amuse any\r\nassembly. To be comic without and tragic within, what suffering can be\r\nmore humiliating? what pain deeper? Gwynplaine felt it. His words were\r\nan appeal in one direction, his face in the other. What a terrible\r\nposition was his!\r\n\r\nSuddenly his voice rang out in strident bursts.\r\n\r\n“How gay these men are! Be it so. Here is irony face to face with agony;\r\na sneer mocking the death-rattle. They are all-powerful. Perhaps so; be\r\nit so. We shall see. Behold! I am one of them; but I am also one of you,\r\nO ye poor! A king sold me. A poor man sheltered me. Who mutilated me? A\r\nprince. Who healed and nourished me? A pauper. I am Lord Clancharlie;\r\nbut I am still Gwynplaine. I take my place amongst the great; but I\r\nbelong to the mean. I am amongst those who rejoice; but I am with those\r\nwho suffer. Oh, this system of society is false! Some day will come that\r\nwhich is true. Then there will be no more lords, and there shall be free\r\nand living men. There will be no more masters; there will be fathers.\r\nSuch is the future. No more prostration; no more baseness; no more\r\nignorance; no more human beasts of burden; no more courtiers; no more\r\ntoadies; no more kings; but Light! In the meantime, see me here. I have\r\na right, and I will use it. Is it a right? No, if I use it for myself;\r\nyes, if I use it for all. I will speak to you, my lords, being one of\r\nyou. O my brothers below, I will tell them of your nakedness. I will\r\nrise up with a bundle of the people’s rags in my hand. I will shake off\r\nover the masters the misery of the slaves; and these favoured and\r\narrogant ones shall no longer be able to escape the remembrance of the\r\nwretched, nor the princes the itch of the poor; and so much the worse,\r\nif it be the bite of vermin; and so much the better, if it awake the\r\nlions from their slumber.”\r\n\r\nHere Gwynplaine turned towards the kneeling under-clerks, who were\r\nwriting on the fourth woolsack.\r\n\r\n“Who are those fellows kneeling down?--What are you doing? Get up; you\r\nare men.”\r\n\r\nThese words, suddenly addressed to inferiors whom a lord ought not even\r\nto perceive, increased the merriment to the utmost.\r\n\r\nThey had cried, “Bravo!” Now they shouted, “Hurrah!” From clapping their\r\nhands they proceeded to stamping their feet. One might have been back in\r\nthe Green Box, only that there the laughter applauded Gwynplaine; here\r\nit exterminated him. The effort of ridicule is to kill. Men’s laughter\r\nsometimes exerts all its power to murder.\r\n\r\nThe laughter proceeded to action. Sneering words rained down upon him.\r\nHumour is the folly of assemblies. Their ingenious and foolish ridicule\r\nshuns facts instead of studying them, and condemns questions instead of\r\nsolving them. Any extraordinary occurrence is a point of interrogation;\r\nto laugh at it is like laughing at an enigma. But the Sphynx, which\r\nnever laughs, is behind it.\r\n\r\nContradictory shouts arose,--\r\n\r\n“Enough! enough!” “Encore! encore!”\r\n\r\nWilliam Farmer, Baron Leimpster, flung at Gwynplaine the insult cast by\r\nRyc Quiney at Shakespeare,--\r\n\r\n“Histrio, mima!”\r\n\r\nLord Vaughan, a sententious man, twenty-ninth on the barons’ bench,\r\nexclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“We must be back in the days when animals had the gift of speech. In the\r\nmidst of human tongues the jaw of a beast has spoken.”\r\n\r\n“Listen to Balaam’s ass,” added Lord Yarmouth.\r\n\r\nLord Yarmouth presented that appearance of sagacity produced by a round\r\nnose and a crooked mouth.\r\n\r\n“The rebel Linnæus is chastised in his tomb. The son is the punishment\r\nof the father,” said John Hough, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, whose\r\nprebendary Gwynplaine’s attack had glanced.\r\n\r\n“He lies!” said Lord Cholmondeley, the legislator so well read up in the\r\nlaw. “That which he calls torture is only the _peine forte et dure_, and\r\na very good thing, too. Torture is not practised in England.”\r\n\r\nThomas Wentworth, Baron Raby, addressed the Chancellor.\r\n\r\n“My Lord Chancellor, adjourn the House.”\r\n\r\n“No, no. Let him go on. He is amusing. Hurrah! hip! hip! hip!”\r\n\r\nThus shouted the young lords, their fun amounting to fury. Four of them\r\nespecially were in the full exasperation of hilarity and hate. These\r\nwere Laurence Hyde, Earl of Rochester; Thomas Tufton, Earl of Thanet;\r\nViscount Hatton; and the Duke of Montagu.\r\n\r\n“To your tricks, Gwynplaine!” cried Rochester.\r\n\r\n“Put him out, put him out!” shouted Thanet.\r\n\r\nViscount Hatton drew from his pocket a penny, which he flung to\r\nGwynplaine.\r\n\r\nAnd John Campbell, Earl of Greenwich; Savage, Earl Rivers; Thompson,\r\nBaron Haversham; Warrington, Escrick Rolleston, Rockingham, Carteret,\r\nLangdale, Barcester, Maynard, Hunsdon, Cäernarvon, Cavendish,\r\nBurlington, Robert Darcy, Earl of Holderness, Other Windsor, Earl of\r\nPlymouth, applauded.\r\n\r\nThere was a tumult as of pandemonium or of pantheon, in which the words\r\nof Gwynplaine were lost.\r\n\r\nAmidst it all, there was heard but one word of Gwynplaine’s: “Beware!”\r\n\r\nRalph, Duke of Montagu, recently down from Oxford, and still a beardless\r\nyouth, descended from the bench of dukes, where he sat the nineteenth in\r\norder, and placed himself in front of Gwynplaine, with his arms folded.\r\nIn a sword there is a spot which cuts sharpest, and in a voice an accent\r\nwhich insults most keenly. Montagu spoke with that accent, and sneering\r\nwith his face close to that of Gwynplaine, shouted,--“What are you\r\ntalking about?”\r\n\r\n“I am prophesying,” said Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nThe laughter exploded anew; and below this laughter, anger growled its\r\ncontinued bass. One of the minors, Lionel Cranfield Sackville, Earl of\r\nDorset and Middlesex, stood upon his seat, not smiling, but grave as\r\nbecame a future legislator, and, without saying a word, looked at\r\nGwynplaine with his fresh twelve-year old face, and shrugged his\r\nshoulders. Whereat the Bishop of St. Asaph’s whispered in the ear of the\r\nBishop of St. David’s, who was sitting beside him, as he pointed to\r\nGwynplaine, “There is the fool;” then pointing to the child, “there is\r\nthe sage.”\r\n\r\nA chaos of complaint rose from amidst the confusion of exclamations:--\r\n\r\n“Gorgon’s face!”--“What does it all mean?”--“An insult to the\r\nHouse!”--“The fellow ought to be put out!”--“What a madman!”--“Shame!\r\nshame!”--“Adjourn the House!”--“No; let him finish his speech!”--“Talk\r\naway, you buffoon!”\r\n\r\nLord Lewis of Duras, with his arms akimbo, shouted,--\r\n\r\n“Ah! it does one good to laugh. My spleen is cured. I propose a vote of\r\nthanks in these terms: ‘The House of Lords returns thanks to the Green\r\nBox.’”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, it may be remembered, had dreamt of a different welcome.\r\n\r\nA man who, climbing up a steep and crumbling acclivity of sand above a\r\ngiddy precipice, has felt it giving way under his hands, his nails, his\r\nelbows, his knees, his feet; who--losing instead of gaining on his\r\ntreacherous way, a prey to every terror of the danger, slipping back\r\ninstead of ascending, increasing the certainty of his fall by his very\r\nefforts to gain the summit, and losing ground in every struggle for\r\nsafety--has felt the abyss approaching nearer and nearer, until the\r\ncertainty of his coming fall into the yawning jaws open to receive him,\r\nhas frozen the marrow of his bones;--that man has experienced the\r\nsensations of Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nHe felt the ground he had ascended crumbling under him, and his audience\r\nwas the precipice.\r\n\r\nThere is always some one to say the word which sums all up.\r\n\r\nLord Scarsdale translated the impression of the assembly in one\r\nexclamation,--\r\n\r\n“What is the monster doing here?”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine stood up, dismayed and indignant, in a sort of final\r\nconvulsion. He looked at them all fixedly.\r\n\r\n“What am I doing here? I have come to be a terror to you! I am a\r\nmonster, do you say? No! I am the people! I am an exception? No! I am\r\nthe rule; you are the exception! You are the chimera; I am the reality!\r\nI am the frightful man who laughs! Who laughs at what? At you, at\r\nhimself, at everything! What is his laugh? Your crime and his torment!\r\nThat crime he flings at your head! That punishment he spits in your\r\nface! I laugh, and that means I weep!”\r\n\r\nHe paused. There was less noise. The laughter continued, but it was more\r\nsubdued. He may have fancied that he had regained a certain amount of\r\nattention. He breathed again, and resumed,--\r\n\r\n“This laugh which is on my face a king placed there. This laugh\r\nexpresses the desolation of mankind. This laugh means hate, enforced\r\nsilence, rage, despair. This laugh is the production of torture. This\r\nlaugh is a forced laugh. If Satan were marked with this laugh, it would\r\nconvict God. But the Eternal is not like them that perish. Being\r\nabsolute, he is just; and God hates the acts of kings. Oh! you take me\r\nfor an exception; but I am a symbol. Oh, all-powerful men, fools that\r\nyou are! open your eyes. I am the incarnation of All. I represent\r\nhumanity, such as its masters have made it. Mankind is mutilated. That\r\nwhich has been done to me has been done to it. In it have been deformed\r\nright, justice, truth, reason, intelligence, as eyes, nostrils, and ears\r\nhave been deformed in me; its heart has been made a sink of passion and\r\npain, like mine, and, like mine, its features have been hidden in a mask\r\nof joy. Where God had placed his finger, the king set his sign-manual.\r\nMonstrous superposition! Bishops, peers, and princes, the people is a\r\nsea of suffering, smiling on the surface. My lords, I tell you that the\r\npeople are as I am. To-day you oppress them; to-day you hoot at me. But\r\nthe future is the ominous thaw, in which that which was as stone shall\r\nbecome wave. The appearance of solidity melts into liquid. A crack in\r\nthe ice, and all is over. There will come an hour when convulsion shall\r\nbreak down your oppression; when an angry roar will reply to your jeers.\r\nNay, that hour did come! Thou wert of it, O my father! That hour of God\r\ndid come, and was called the Republic! It was destroyed, but it will\r\nreturn. Meanwhile, remember that the line of kings armed with the sword\r\nwas broken by Cromwell, armed with the axe. Tremble! Incorruptible\r\nsolutions are at hand: the talons which were cut are growing again; the\r\ntongues which were torn out are floating away, they are turning to\r\ntongues of fire, and, scattered by the breath of darkness, are shouting\r\nthrough infinity; those who hunger are showing their idle teeth; false\r\nheavens, built over real hells, are tottering. The people are\r\nsuffering--they are suffering; and that which is on high totters, and\r\nthat which is below yawns. Darkness demands its change to light; the\r\ndamned discuss the elect. Behold! it is the coming of the people, the\r\nascent of mankind, the beginning of the end, the red dawn of the\r\ncatastrophe! Yes, all these things are in this laugh of mine, at which\r\nyou laugh to-day! London is one perpetual fête. Be it so. From one end\r\nto the other, England rings with acclamation. Well! but listen. All that\r\nyou see is I. You have your fêtes--they are my laugh; you have your\r\npublic rejoicings--they are my laugh; you have your weddings,\r\nconsecrations, and coronations--they are my laugh. The births of your\r\nprinces are my laugh. But above you is the thunderbolt--it is my laugh.”\r\n\r\nHow could they stand such nonsense? The laughter burst out afresh; and\r\nnow it was overwhelming. Of all the lava which that crater, the human\r\nmouth, ejects, the most corrosive is joy. To inflict evil gaily is a\r\ncontagion which no crowd can resist. All executions do not take place on\r\nthe scaffold; and men, from the moment they are in a body, whether in\r\nmobs or in senates, have always a ready executioner amongst them, called\r\nsarcasm. There is no torture to be compared to that of the wretch\r\ncondemned to execution by ridicule. This was Gwynplaine’s fate. He was\r\nstoned with their jokes, and riddled by the scoffs shot at him. He stood\r\nthere a mark for all. They sprang up; they cried, “Encore;” they shook\r\nwith laughter; they stamped their feet; they pulled each other’s bands.\r\nThe majesty of the place, the purple of the robes, the chaste ermine,\r\nthe dignity of the wigs, had no effect. The lords laughed, the bishops\r\nlaughed, the judges laughed, the old men’s benches derided, the\r\nchildren’s benches were in convulsions. The Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nnudged the Archbishop of York; Henry Compton, Bishop of London, brother\r\nof Lord Northampton, held his sides; the Lord Chancellor bent down his\r\nhead, probably to conceal his inclination to laugh; and, at the bar,\r\nthat statue of respect, the Usher of the Black Rod, was laughing also.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, become pallid, had folded his arms; and, surrounded by all\r\nthose faces, young and old, in which had burst forth this grand Homeric\r\njubilee; in that whirlwind of clapping hands, of stamping feet, and of\r\nhurrahs; in that mad buffoonery, of which he was the centre; in that\r\nsplendid overflow of hilarity; in the midst of that unmeasured gaiety,\r\nhe felt that the sepulchre was within him. All was over. He could no\r\nlonger master the face which betrayed nor the audience which insulted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThat eternal and fatal law by which the grotesque is linked with the\r\nsublime--by which the laugh re-echoes the groan, parody rides behind\r\ndespair, and seeming is opposed to being--had never found more terrible\r\nexpression. Never had a light more sinister illumined the depths of\r\nhuman darkness.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine was assisting at the final destruction of his destiny by a\r\nburst of laughter. The irremediable was in this. Having fallen, we can\r\nraise ourselves up; but, being pulverized, never. And the insult of\r\ntheir sovereign mockery had reduced him to dust. From thenceforth\r\nnothing was possible. Everything is in accordance with the scene. That\r\nwhich was triumph in the Green Box was disgrace and catastrophe in the\r\nHouse of Lords. What was applause there, was insult here. He felt\r\nsomething like the reverse side of his mask. On one side of that mask he\r\nhad the sympathy of the people, who welcomed Gwynplaine; on the other,\r\nthe contempt of the great, rejecting Lord Fermain Clancharlie. On one\r\nside, attraction; on the other, repulsion; both leading him towards the\r\nshadows. He felt himself, as it were, struck from behind. Fate strikes\r\ntreacherous blows. Everything will be explained hereafter, but, in the\r\nmeantime, destiny is a snare, and man sinks into its pitfalls. He had\r\nexpected to rise, and was welcomed by laughter. Such apotheoses have\r\nlugubrious terminations. There is a dreary expression--to be sobered;\r\ntragical wisdom born of drunkenness! In the midst of that tempest of\r\ngaiety commingled with ferocity, Gwynplaine fell into a reverie.\r\n\r\nAn assembly in mad merriment drifts as chance directs, and loses its\r\ncompass when it gives itself to laughter. None knew whither they were\r\ntending, or what they were doing. The House was obliged to rise,\r\nadjourned by the Lord Chancellor, “owing to extraordinary\r\ncircumstances,” to the next day. The peers broke up. They bowed to the\r\nroyal throne and departed. Echoes of prolonged laughter were heard\r\nlosing themselves in the corridors.\r\n\r\nAssemblies, besides their official doors, have--under tapestry, under\r\nprojections, and under arches--all sorts of hidden doors, by which the\r\nmembers escape like water through the cracks in a vase. In a short time\r\nthe chamber was deserted. This takes place quickly and almost\r\nimperceptibly, and those places, so lately full of voices, are suddenly\r\ngiven back to silence.\r\n\r\nReverie carries one far; and one comes by long dreaming to reach, as it\r\nwere, another planet.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine suddenly awoke from such a dream. He was alone. The chamber\r\nwas empty. He had not even observed that the House had been adjourned.\r\nAll the peers had departed, even his sponsors. There only remained here\r\nand there some of the lower officers of the House, waiting for his\r\nlordship to depart before they put the covers on and extinguished the\r\nlights.\r\n\r\nMechanically he placed his hat on his head, and, leaving his place,\r\ndirected his steps to the great door opening into the gallery. As he was\r\npassing through the opening in the bar, a doorkeeper relieved him of his\r\npeer’s robes. This he scarcely felt. In another instant he was in the\r\ngallery.\r\n\r\nThe officials who remained observed with astonishment that the peer had\r\ngone out without bowing to the throne!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nHE WOULD BE A GOOD BROTHER, WERE HE NOT A GOOD SON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no one in the gallery.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine crossed the circular space, from whence they had removed the\r\narm-chair and the tables, and where there now remained no trace of his\r\ninvestiture. Candelabra and lustres, placed at certain intervals, marked\r\nthe way out. Thanks to this string of light, he retraced without\r\ndifficulty, through the suite of saloons and galleries, the way which he\r\nhad followed on his arrival with the King-at-Arms and the Usher of the\r\nBlack Rod. He saw no one, except here and there some old lord with tardy\r\nsteps, plodding along heavily in front of him.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the silence of those great deserted rooms, bursts of\r\nindistinct exclamations reached him, a sort of nocturnal clatter unusual\r\nin such a place. He directed his steps to the place whence this noise\r\nproceeded, and found himself in a spacious hall, dimly lighted, which\r\nwas one of the exits from the House of Lords. He saw a great glass door\r\nopen, a flight of steps, footmen and links, a square outside, and a few\r\ncoaches waiting at the bottom of the steps.\r\n\r\nThis was the spot from which the noise which he had heard had proceeded.\r\n\r\nWithin the door, and under the hall lamp, was a noisy group in a storm\r\nof gestures and of voices.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine approached in the gloom.\r\n\r\nThey were quarrelling. On one side there were ten or twelve young lords,\r\nwho wanted to go out; on the other, a man, with his hat on, like\r\nthemselves, upright and with a haughty brow, who barred their passage.\r\n\r\nWho was this man? Tom-Jim-Jack.\r\n\r\nSome of these lords were still in their robes, others had thrown them\r\noff, and were in their usual attire. Tom-Jim-Jack wore a hat with\r\nplumes--not white, like the peers; but green tipped with orange. He was\r\nembroidered and laced from head to foot, had flowing bows of ribbon and\r\nlace round his wrists and neck, and was feverishly fingering with his\r\nleft hand the hilt of the sword which hung from his waistbelt, and on\r\nthe billets and scabbard of which were embroidered an admiral’s anchors.\r\n\r\nIt was he who was speaking and addressing the young lords; and\r\nGwynplaine overheard the following:--\r\n\r\n“I have told you you are cowards. You wish me to withdraw my words. Be\r\nit so. You are not cowards; you are idiots. You all combined against one\r\nman. That was not cowardice. All right. Then it was stupidity. He spoke\r\nto you, and you did not understand him. Here, the old are hard of\r\nhearing, the young devoid of intelligence. I am one of your own order to\r\nquite sufficient extent to tell you the truth. This new-comer is\r\nstrange, and he has uttered a heap of nonsense, I admit; but amidst all\r\nthat nonsense there were some things which were true. His speech was\r\nconfused, undigested, ill-delivered. Be it so. He repeated, ‘You know,\r\nyou know,’ too often; but a man who was but yesterday a clown at a fair\r\ncannot be expected to speak like Aristotle or like Doctor Gilbert\r\nBurnet, Bishop of Salisbury. The vermin, the lions, the address to the\r\nunder-clerks--all that was in bad taste. Zounds! who says it wasn’t? It\r\nwas a senseless and fragmentary and topsy-turvy harangue; but here and\r\nthere came out facts which were true. It is no small thing to speak even\r\nas he did, seeing it is not his trade. I should like to see you do it.\r\nYes, you! What he said about the lepers at Burton Lazars is an\r\nundeniable fact. Besides, he is not the first man who has talked\r\nnonsense. In fine, my lords, I do not like to see many set upon one.\r\nSuch is my humour; and I ask your lordships’ permission to take offence.\r\nYou have displeased me; I am angry. I am grateful to God for having\r\ndrawn up from the depth of his low existence this peer of England, and\r\nfor having given back his inheritance to the heir; and, without heeding\r\nwhether it will or will not affect my own affairs, I consider it a\r\nbeautiful sight to see an insect transformed into an eagle, and\r\nGwynplaine into Lord Clancharlie. My lords, I forbid you holding any\r\nopinion but mine. I regret that Lord Lewis Duras should not be here. I\r\nshould like to insult him. My lords, it is Fermain Clancharlie who has\r\nbeen the peer, and you who have been the mountebanks. As to his laugh,\r\nit is not his fault. You have laughed at that laugh; men should not\r\nlaugh at misfortune. If you think that people cannot laugh at you as\r\nwell, you are very much mistaken. You are ugly. You are badly dressed.\r\nMy Lord Haversham, I saw your mistress the other day; she is hideous--a\r\nduchess, but a monkey. Gentlemen who laugh, I repeat that I should like\r\nto hear you try to say four words running! Many men jabber; very few\r\nspeak. You imagine you know something, because you have kept idle terms\r\nat Oxford or Cambridge, and because, before being peers of England on\r\nthe benches of Westminster, you have been asses on the benches at\r\nGonville and Caius. Here I am; and I choose to stare you in the face.\r\nYou have just been impudent to this new peer. A monster, certainly; but\r\na monster given up to beasts. I had rather be that man than you. I was\r\npresent at the sitting, in my place as a possible heir to a peerage. I\r\nheard all. I have not the right to speak; but I have the right to be a\r\ngentleman. Your jeering airs annoyed me. When I am angry I would go up\r\nto Mount Pendlehill, and pick the cloudberry which brings the\r\nthunderbolt down on the gatherer. That is the reason why I have waited\r\nfor you at the door. We must have a few words, for we have arrangements\r\nto make. Did it strike you that you failed a little in respect towards\r\nmyself? My lords, I entertain a firm determination to kill a few of you.\r\nAll you who are here--Thomas Tufton, Earl of Thanet; Savage, Earl\r\nRivers; Charles Spencer, Earl of Sunderland; Laurence Hyde, Earl of\r\nRochester; you Barons, Gray of Rolleston, Cary Hunsdon, Escrick,\r\nRockingham, little Carteret; Robert Darcy, Earl of Holderness; William,\r\nViscount Hutton; and Ralph, Duke of Montagu; and any who choose--I,\r\nDavid Dirry-Moir, an officer of the fleet, summon, call, and command you\r\nto provide yourselves, in all haste, with seconds and umpires, and I\r\nwill meet you face to face and hand to hand, to-night, at once,\r\nto-morrow, by day or night, by sunlight or by candlelight, where, when,\r\nor how you please, so long as there is two sword-lengths’ space; and you\r\nwill do well to look to the flints of your pistols and the edges of your\r\nrapiers, for it is my firm intention to cause vacancies in your\r\npeerages.--Ogle Cavendish, take your measures, and think of your motto,\r\n_Cavendo tutus_.--Marmaduke Langdale, you will do well, like your\r\nancestor, Grindold, to order a coffin to be brought with you.--George\r\nBooth, Earl of Warrington, you will never again see the County Palatine\r\nof Chester, or your labyrinth like that of Crete, or the high towers of\r\nDunham Massy!--As to Lord Vaughan, he is young enough to talk\r\nimpertinently, and too old to answer for it. I shall demand satisfaction\r\nfor his words of his nephew Richard Vaughan, Member of Parliament for\r\nthe Borough of Merioneth.--As for you, John Campbell, Earl of Greenwich,\r\nI will kill you as Achon killed Matas; but with a fair cut, and not from\r\nbehind, it being my custom to present my heart and not my back to the\r\npoint of the sword.--I have spoken my mind, my lords. And so use\r\nwitchcraft if you like. Consult the fortune-tellers. Grease your skins\r\nwith ointments and drugs to make them invulnerable; hang round your\r\nnecks charms of the devil or the Virgin. I will fight you blest or\r\ncurst, and I will not have you searched to see if you are wearing any\r\nwizard’s tokens. On foot or on horseback, on the highroad if you wish\r\nit, in Piccadilly, or at Charing Cross; and they shall take up the\r\npavement for our meeting, as they unpaved the court of the Louvre for\r\nthe duel between Guise and Bassompierre. All of you! Do you hear? I mean\r\nto fight you all.--Dorme, Earl of Caernarvon, I will make you swallow my\r\nsword up to the hilt, as Marolles did to Lisle Mariveaux, and then we\r\nshall see, my lord, whether you will laugh or not.--You, Burlington, who\r\nlook like a girl of seventeen--you shall choose between the lawn of your\r\nhouse in Middlesex, and your beautiful garden at Londesborough in\r\nYorkshire, to be buried in.--I beg to inform your lordships that it does\r\nnot suit me to allow your insolence in my presence. I will chastise you,\r\nmy lords. I take it ill that you should have ridiculed Lord Fermain\r\nClancharlie. He is worth more than you. As Clancharlie, he has nobility,\r\nwhich you have; as Gwynplaine, he has intellect, which you have not. I\r\nmake his cause my cause, insult to him insult to me, and your ridicule\r\nmy wrath. We shall see who will come out of this affair alive, because I\r\nchallenge you to the death. Do you understand? With any arm, in any\r\nfashion, and you shall choose the death that pleases you best; and since\r\nyou are clowns as well as gentlemen, I proportion my defiance to your\r\nqualities, and I give you your choice of any way in which a man can be\r\nkilled, from the sword of the prince to the fist of the blackguard.”\r\n\r\nTo this furious onslaught of words the whole group of young noblemen\r\nanswered by a smile. “Agreed,” they said.\r\n\r\n“I choose pistols,” said Burlington.\r\n\r\n“I,” said Escrick, “the ancient combat of the lists, with the mace and\r\nthe dagger.”\r\n\r\n“I,” said Holderness, “the duel with two knives, long and short,\r\nstripped to the waist, and breast to breast.”\r\n\r\n“Lord David,” said the Earl of Thanet, “you are a Scot. I choose the\r\nclaymore.”\r\n\r\n“I the sword,” said Rockingham.\r\n\r\n“I,” said Duke Ralph, “prefer the fists; ’tis noblest.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine came out from the shadow. He directed his steps towards him\r\nwhom he had hitherto called Tom-Jim-Jack, but in whom now, however, he\r\nbegan to perceive something more. “I thank you,” said he, “but this is\r\nmy business.”\r\n\r\nEvery head turned towards him.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine advanced. He felt himself impelled towards the man whom he\r\nheard called Lord David--his defender, and perhaps something nearer.\r\nLord David drew back.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said he. “It is you, is it? This is well-timed. I have a word for\r\nyou as well. Just now you spoke of a woman who, after having loved Lord\r\nLinnæus Clancharlie, loved Charles II.”\r\n\r\n“It is true.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, you insulted my mother.”\r\n\r\n“Your mother!” cried Gwynplaine. “In that case, as I guessed, we are--”\r\n\r\n“Brothers,” answered Lord David, and he struck Gwynplaine. “We are\r\nbrothers,” said he; “so we can fight. One can only fight one’s equal;\r\nwho is one’s equal if not one’s brother? I will send you my seconds;\r\nto-morrow we will cut each other’s throats.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE NINTH.\r\n\r\n_IN RUINS._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nIT IS THROUGH EXCESS OF GREATNESS THAT MAN REACHES EXCESS OF MISERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs midnight tolled from St. Paul’s, a man who had just crossed London\r\nBridge struck into the lanes of Southwark. There were no lamps lighted,\r\nit being at that time the custom in London, as in Paris, to extinguish\r\nthe public lamps at eleven o’clock--that is, to put them out just as\r\nthey became necessary. The streets were dark and deserted. When the\r\nlamps are out men stay in. He whom we speak of advanced with hurried\r\nstrides. He was strangely dressed for walking at such an hour. He wore a\r\ncoat of embroidered silk, a sword by his side, a hat with white plumes,\r\nand no cloak. The watchmen, as they saw him pass, said, “It is a lord\r\nwalking for a wager,” and they moved out of his way with the respect due\r\nto a lord and to a better.\r\n\r\nThe man was Gwynplaine. He was making his escape. Where was he? He did\r\nnot know. We have said that the soul has its cyclones--fearful\r\nwhirlwinds, in which heaven, the sea, day, night, life, death, are all\r\nmingled in unintelligible horror. It can no longer breathe Truth; it is\r\ncrushed by things in which it does not believe. Nothingness becomes\r\nhurricane. The firmament pales. Infinity is empty. The mind of the\r\nsufferer wanders away. He feels himself dying. He craves for a star.\r\nWhat did Gwynplaine feel? a thirst--a thirst to see Dea.\r\n\r\nHe felt but that. To reach the Green Box again, and the Tadcaster Inn,\r\nwith its sounds and light--full of the cordial laughter of the people;\r\nto find Ursus and Homo, to see Dea again, to re-enter life. Disillusion,\r\nlike a bow, shoots its arrow, man, towards the True. Gwynplaine hastened\r\non. He approached Tarrinzeau Field. He walked no longer now; he ran. His\r\neyes pierced the darkness before him. His glance preceded him, eagerly\r\nseeking the harbour on the horizon. What a moment for him when he should\r\nsee the lighted windows of Tadcaster Inn!\r\n\r\nHe reached the bowling-green. He turned the corner of the wall, and saw\r\nbefore him, at the other end of the field, some distance off, the\r\ninn--the only house, it may be remembered, in the field where the fair\r\nwas held.\r\n\r\nHe looked. There was no light; nothing but a black mass.\r\n\r\nHe shuddered. Then he said to himself that it was late; that the tavern\r\nwas shut up; that it was very natural; that every one was asleep; that\r\nhe had only to awaken Nicless or Govicum; that he must go up to the inn\r\nand knock at the door. He did so, running no longer now, but rushing.\r\n\r\nHe reached the inn, breathless. It is when, storm-beaten and struggling\r\nin the invisible convulsions of the soul until he knows not whether he\r\nis in life or in death, that all the delicacy of a man’s affection for\r\nhis loved ones, being yet unimpaired, proves a heart true. When all else\r\nis swallowed up, tenderness still floats unshattered. Not to awaken Dea\r\ntoo suddenly was Gwynplaine’s first thought. He approached the inn with\r\nas little noise as possible. He recognized the nook, the old dog kennel,\r\nwhere Govicum used to sleep. In it, contiguous to the lower room, was a\r\nwindow opening on to the field. Gwynplaine tapped softly at the pane. It\r\nwould be enough to awaken Govicum, he thought.\r\n\r\nThere was no sound in Govicum’s room.\r\n\r\n“At his age,” said Gwynplaine, “a boy sleeps soundly.”\r\n\r\nWith the back of his hand he knocked against the window gently. Nothing\r\nstirred.\r\n\r\nHe knocked louder twice. Still nothing stirred. Then, feeling somewhat\r\nuneasy, he went to the door of the inn and knocked. No one answered. He\r\nreflected, and began to feel a cold shudder come over him.\r\n\r\n“Master Nicless is old, children sleep soundly, and old men heavily.\r\nCourage! louder!”\r\n\r\nHe had tapped, he had knocked, he had kicked the door; now he flung\r\nhimself against it.\r\n\r\nThis recalled to him a distant memory of Weymouth, when, a little child,\r\nhe had carried Dea, an infant, in his arms.\r\n\r\nHe battered the door again violently, like a lord, which, alas! he was.\r\n\r\nThe house remained silent. He felt that he was losing his head. He no\r\nlonger thought of caution. He shouted,--\r\n\r\n“Nicless! Govicum!”\r\n\r\nAt the same time he looked up at the windows, to see if any candle was\r\nlighted. But the inn was blank. Not a voice, not a sound, not a glimmer\r\nof light. He went to the gate and knocked at it, kicked against it, and\r\nshook it, crying out wildly,--\r\n\r\n“Ursus! Homo!”\r\n\r\nThe wolf did not bark.\r\n\r\nA cold sweat stood in drops upon his brow. He cast his eyes around. The\r\nnight was dark; but there were stars enough to render the fair-green\r\nvisible. He saw--a melancholy sight to him--that everything on it had\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nThere was not a single caravan. The circus was gone. Not a tent, not a\r\nbooth, not a cart, remained. The strollers, with their thousand noisy\r\ncries, who had swarmed there, had given place to a black and sullen\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\nAll were gone.\r\n\r\nThe madness of anxiety took possession of him. What did this mean? What\r\nhad happened? Was no one left? Could it be that life had crumbled away\r\nbehind him? What had happened to them all? Good heavens! Then he rushed\r\nlike a tempest against the house. He struck the small door, the gate,\r\nthe windows, the window-shutters, the walls, with fists and feet,\r\nfurious with terror and agony of mind.\r\n\r\nHe called Nicless, Govicum, Fibi, Vinos, Ursus, Homo. He tried every\r\nshout and every sound against this wall. At times he waited and\r\nlistened; but the house remained mute and dead. Then, exasperated, he\r\nbegan again with blows, shouts, and repeated knockings, re-echoed all\r\naround. It might have been thunder trying to awake the grave.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain stage of fright in which a man becomes terrible. He\r\nwho fears everything fears nothing. He would strike the Sphynx. He\r\ndefies the Unknown.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine renewed the noise in every possible form--stopping, resuming,\r\nunwearying in the shouts and appeals by which he assailed the tragic\r\nsilence. He called a thousand times on the names of those who should\r\nhave been there. He shrieked out every name except that of Dea--a\r\nprecaution of which he could not have explained the reason himself, but\r\nwhich instinct inspired even in his distraction.\r\n\r\nHaving exhausted calls and cries, nothing was left but to break in.\r\n\r\n“I must enter the house,” he said to himself; “but how?”\r\n\r\nHe broke a pane of glass in Govicum’s room by thrusting his hand through\r\nit, tearing the flesh; he drew the bolt of the sash and opened the\r\nwindow. Perceiving that his sword was in the way, he tore it off\r\nangrily, scabbard, blade, and belt, and flung it on the pavement. Then\r\nhe raised himself by the inequalities in the wall, and though the window\r\nwas narrow, he was able to pass through it. He entered the inn.\r\nGovicum’s bed, dimly visible in its nook, was there; but Govicum was not\r\nin it. If Govicum was not in his bed, it was evident that Nicless could\r\nnot be in his.\r\n\r\nThe whole house was dark. He felt in that shadowy interior the\r\nmysterious immobility of emptiness, and that vague fear which\r\nsignifies--“There is no one here.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, convulsed with anxiety, crossed the lower room, knocking\r\nagainst the tables, upsetting the earthenware, throwing down the\r\nbenches, sweeping against the jugs, and, striding over the furniture,\r\nreached the door leading into the court, and broke it open with one blow\r\nfrom his knee, which sprung the lock. The door turned on its hinges. He\r\nlooked into the court. The Green Box was no longer there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE DREGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGwynplaine left the house, and began to explore Tarrinzeau Field in\r\nevery direction. He went to every place where, the day before, the tents\r\nand caravans had stood. He knocked at the stalls, though he knew well\r\nthat they were uninhabited. He struck everything that looked like a\r\ndoor or a window. Not a voice arose from the darkness. Something like\r\ndeath had been there.\r\n\r\nThe ant-hill had been razed. Some measures of police had apparently been\r\ncarried out. There had been what, in our days, would be called a\r\n_razzia_. Tarrinzeau Field was worse than a desert; it had been scoured,\r\nand every corner of it scratched up, as it were, by pitiless claws. The\r\npocket of the unfortunate fair-green had been turned inside out, and\r\ncompletely emptied.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, after having searched every yard of ground, left the green,\r\nstruck into the crooked streets abutting on the site called East Point,\r\nand directed his steps towards the Thames. He had threaded his way\r\nthrough a network of lanes, bounded only by walls and hedges, when he\r\nfelt the fresh breeze from the water, heard the dull lapping of the\r\nriver, and suddenly saw a parapet in front of him. It was the parapet of\r\nthe Effroc stone.\r\n\r\nThis parapet bounded a block of the quay, which was very short and very\r\nnarrow. Under it the high wall, the Effroc stone, buried itself\r\nperpendicularly in the dark water below.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine stopped at the parapet, and, leaning his elbows on it, laid\r\nhis head in his hands and set to thinking, with the water beneath him.\r\n\r\nDid he look at the water? No. At what then? At the shadow; not the\r\nshadow without, but within him. In the melancholy night-bound landscape,\r\nwhich he scarcely marked, in the outer depths, which his eyes did not\r\npierce, were the blurred sketches of masts and spars. Below the Effroc\r\nstone there was nothing on the river; but the quay sloped insensibly\r\ndownwards till, some distance off, it met a pier, at which several\r\nvessels were lying, some of which had just arrived, others which were on\r\nthe point of departure. These vessels communicated with the shore by\r\nlittle jetties, constructed for the purpose, some of stone, some of\r\nwood, or by movable gangways. All of them, whether moored to the jetties\r\nor at anchor, were wrapped in silence. There was neither voice nor\r\nmovement on board, it being a good habit of sailors to sleep when they\r\ncan, and awake only when wanted. If any of them were to sail during the\r\nnight at high tide, the crews were not yet awake. The hulls, like large\r\nblack bubbles, and the rigging, like threads mingled with ladders, were\r\nbarely visible. All was livid and confused. Here and there a red cresset\r\npierced the haze.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine saw nothing of all this. What he was musing on was destiny.\r\n\r\nHe was in a dream--a vision--giddy in presence of an inexorable reality.\r\n\r\nHe fancied that he heard behind him something like an earthquake. It was\r\nthe laughter of the Lords.\r\n\r\nFrom that laughter he had just emerged. He had come out of it, having\r\nreceived a blow, and from whom?\r\n\r\nFrom his own brother!\r\n\r\nFlying from the laughter, carrying with him the blow, seeking refuge, a\r\nwounded bird, in his nest, rushing from hate and seeking love, what had\r\nhe found?\r\n\r\nDarkness.\r\n\r\nNo one.\r\n\r\nEverything gone.\r\n\r\nHe compared that darkness to the dream he had indulged in.\r\n\r\nWhat a crumbling away!\r\n\r\nGwynplaine had just reached that sinister bound--the void. The Green Box\r\ngone was his universe vanished.\r\n\r\nHis soul had been closed up.\r\n\r\nHe reflected.\r\n\r\nWhat could have happened? Where were they? They had evidently been\r\ncarried away. Destiny had given him, Gwynplaine, a blow, which was\r\ngreatness; its reaction had struck them another, which was annihilation.\r\nIt was clear that he would never see them again. Precautions had been\r\ntaken against that. They had scoured the fair-green, beginning by\r\nNicless and Govicum, so that he should gain no clue through them.\r\nInexorable dispersion! That fearful social system, at the same time that\r\nit had pulverized him in the House of Lords, had crushed them in their\r\nlittle cabin. They were lost; Dea was lost--lost to him for ever. Powers\r\nof heaven! where was she? And he had not been there to defend her!\r\n\r\nTo have to make guesses as to the absent whom we love is to put oneself\r\nto the torture. He inflicted this torture on himself. At every thought\r\nthat he fathomed, at every supposition which he made, he felt within him\r\na moan of agony.\r\n\r\nThrough a succession of bitter reflections he remembered a man who was\r\nevidently fatal to him, and who had called himself Barkilphedro. That\r\nman had inscribed on his brain a dark sentence which reappeared now; he\r\nhad written it in such terrible ink that every letter had turned to\r\nfire; and Gwynplaine saw flaming at the bottom of his thought the\r\nenigmatical words, the meaning of which was at length solved: “Destiny\r\nnever opens one door without closing another.”\r\n\r\nAll was over. The final shadows had gathered about him. In every man’s\r\nfate there may be an end of the world for himself alone. It is called\r\ndespair. The soul is full of falling stars.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was what he had come to.\r\n\r\nA vapour had passed. He had been mingled with it. It had lain heavily on\r\nhis eyes; it had disordered his brain. He had been outwardly blinded,\r\nintoxicated within. This had lasted the time of a passing vapour. Then\r\neverything melted away, the vapour and his life. Awaking from the dream,\r\nhe found himself alone.\r\n\r\nAll vanished, all gone, all lost--night--nothingness. Such was his\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nHe was alone.\r\n\r\nAlone has a synonym, which is Dead. Despair is an accountant. It sets\r\nitself to find its total; it adds up everything, even to the farthings.\r\nIt reproaches Heaven with its thunderbolts and its pinpricks. It seeks\r\nto find what it has to expect from fate. It argues, weighs, and\r\ncalculates, outwardly cool, while the burning lava is still flowing on\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine examined himself, and examined his fate.\r\n\r\nThe backward glance of thought; terrible recapitulation!\r\n\r\nWhen at the top of a mountain, we look down the precipice; when at the\r\nbottom, we look up at heaven. And we say, “I was there.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine was at the very bottom of misfortune. How sudden, too, had\r\nbeen his fall!\r\n\r\nSuch is the hideous swiftness of misfortune, although it is so heavy\r\nthat we might fancy it slow. But no! It would likewise appear that snow,\r\nfrom its coldness, ought to be the paralysis of winter, and, from its\r\nwhiteness, the immobility of the winding-sheet. Yet this is contradicted\r\nby the avalanche.\r\n\r\nThe avalanche is snow become a furnace. It remains frozen, but it\r\ndevours. The avalanche had enveloped Gwynplaine. He had been torn like a\r\nrag, uprooted like a tree, precipitated like a stone. He recalled all\r\nthe circumstances of his fall. He put himself questions, and returned\r\nanswers. Grief is an examination. There is no judge so searching as\r\nconscience conducting its own trial.\r\n\r\nWhat amount of remorse was there in his despair? This he wished to find\r\nout, and dissected his conscience. Excruciating vivisection!\r\n\r\nHis absence had caused a catastrophe. Had this absence depended on him?\r\nIn all that had happened, had he been a free agent? No! He had felt\r\nhimself captive. What was that which had arrested and detained him--a\r\nprison? No. A chain? No. What then? Sticky slime! He had sunk into the\r\nslough of greatness.\r\n\r\nTo whom has it not happened to be free in appearance, yet to feel that\r\nhis wings are hampered?\r\n\r\nThere had been something like a snare spread for him. What is at first\r\ntemptation ends by captivity.\r\n\r\nNevertheless--and his conscience pressed him on this point--had he\r\nmerely submitted to what had been offered him? No; he had accepted it.\r\n\r\nViolence and surprise had been used with him in a certain measure, it\r\nwas true; but he, in a certain measure, had given in. To have allowed\r\nhimself to be carried off was not his fault; but to have allowed himself\r\nto be inebriated was his weakness. There had been a moment--a decisive\r\nmoment--when the question was proposed. This Barkilphedro had placed a\r\ndilemma before Gwynplaine, and had given him clear power to decide his\r\nfate by a word. Gwynplaine might have said, “No.” He had said, “Yes.”\r\n\r\nFrom that “Yes,” uttered in a moment of dizziness, everything had\r\nsprung. Gwynplaine realized this now in the bitter aftertaste of that\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\nNevertheless--for he debated with himself--was it then so great a wrong\r\nto take possession of his right, of his patrimony, of his heritage, of\r\nhis house; and, as a patrician, of the rank of his ancestors; as an\r\norphan, of the name of his father? What had he accepted? A restitution.\r\nMade by whom? By Providence.\r\n\r\nThen his mind revolted. Senseless acceptance! What a bargain had he\r\nstruck! what a foolish exchange! He had trafficked with Providence at a\r\nloss. How now! For an income of £80,000 a year; for seven or eight\r\ntitles; for ten or twelve palaces; for houses in town, and castles in\r\nthe country; for a hundred lackeys; for packs of hounds, and carriages,\r\nand armorial bearings; to be a judge and legislator; for a coronet and\r\npurple robes, like a king; to be a baron and a marquis; to be a peer of\r\nEngland, he had given the hut of Ursus and the smile of Dea. For\r\nshipwreck and destruction in the surging immensity of greatness, he had\r\nbartered happiness. For the ocean he had given the pearl. O madman! O\r\nfool! O dupe!\r\n\r\nYet nevertheless--and here the objection reappeared on firmer ground--in\r\nthis fever of high fortune which had seized him all had not been\r\nunwholesome. Perhaps there would have been selfishness in renunciation;\r\nperhaps he had done his duty in the acceptance. Suddenly transformed\r\ninto a lord, what ought he to have done? The complication of events\r\nproduces perplexity of mind. This had happened to him. Duty gave\r\ncontrary orders. Duty on all sides at once, duty multiple and\r\ncontradictory--this was the bewilderment which he had suffered. It was\r\nthis that had paralyzed him, especially when he had not refused to take\r\nthe journey from Corleone Lodge to the House of Lords. What we call\r\nrising in life is leaving the safe for the dangerous path. Which is,\r\nthenceforth, the straight line? Towards whom is our first duty? Is it\r\ntowards those nearest to ourselves, or is it towards mankind generally?\r\nDo we not cease to belong to our own circumscribed circle, and become\r\npart of the great family of all? As we ascend we feel an increased\r\npressure on our virtue. The higher we rise, the greater is the strain.\r\nThe increase of right is an increase of duty. We come to many\r\ncross-ways, phantom roads perchance, and we imagine that we see the\r\nfinger of conscience pointing each one of them out to us. Which shall we\r\ntake? Change our direction, remain where we are, advance, go back? What\r\nare we to do? That there should be cross-roads in conscience is strange\r\nenough; but responsibility may be a labyrinth. And when a man contains\r\nan idea, when he is the incarnation of a fact--when he is a symbolical\r\nman, at the same time that he is a man of flesh and blood--is not the\r\nresponsibility still more oppressive? Thence the care-laden docility and\r\nthe dumb anxiety of Gwynplaine; thence his obedience when summoned to\r\ntake his seat. A pensive man is often a passive man. He had heard what\r\nhe fancied was the command of duty itself. Was not that entrance into a\r\nplace where oppression could be discussed and resisted the realization\r\nof one of his deepest aspirations? When he had been called upon to\r\nspeak--he the fearful human scantling, he the living specimen of the\r\ndespotic whims under which, for six thousand years, mankind has groaned\r\nin agony--had he the right to refuse? Had he the right to withdraw his\r\nhead from under the tongue of fire descending from on high to rest upon\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nIn the obscure and giddy debate of conscience, what had he said to\r\nhimself? This: “The people are a silence. I will be the mighty advocate\r\nof that silence; I will speak for the dumb; I will speak of the little\r\nto the great--of the weak to the powerful. This is the purpose of my\r\nfate. God wills what He wills, and does it. It was a wonder that\r\nHardquanonne’s flask, in which was the metamorphosis of Gwynplaine into\r\nLord Clancharlie, should have floated for fifteen years on the ocean, on\r\nthe billows, in the surf, through the storms, and that all the raging of\r\nthe sea did it no harm. But I can see the reason. There are destinies\r\nwith secret springs. I have the key of mine, and know its enigma. I am\r\npredestined; I have a mission. I will be the poor man’s lord; I will\r\nspeak for the speechless with despair; I will translate inarticulate\r\nremonstrance; I will translate the mutterings, the groans, the murmurs,\r\nthe voices of the crowd, their ill-spoken complaints, their\r\nunintelligible words, and those animal-like cries which ignorance and\r\nsuffering put into men’s mouths. The clamour of men is as inarticulate\r\nas the howling of the wind. They cry out, but they are understood; so\r\nthat cries become equivalent to silence, and silence with them means\r\nthrowing down their arms. This forced disarmament calls for help. I will\r\nbe their help; I will be the Denunciation; I will be the Word of the\r\npeople. Thanks to me, they shall be understood. I will be the bleeding\r\nmouth from which the gag has been torn. I will tell everything. This\r\nwill be great indeed.”\r\n\r\nYes; it is fine to speak for the dumb, but to speak to the deaf is sad.\r\nAnd that was his second part in the drama.\r\n\r\nAlas! he had failed irremediably. The elevation in which he had\r\nbelieved, the high fortune, had melted away like a mirage. And what a\r\nfall! To be drowned in a surge of laughter!\r\n\r\nHe had believed himself strong--he who, during so many years, had\r\nfloated with observant mind on the wide sea of suffering; he who had\r\nbrought back out of the great shadow so touching a cry. He had been\r\nflung against that huge rock the frivolity of the fortunate. He believed\r\nhimself an avenger; he was but a clown. He thought that he wielded the\r\nthunderbolt; he did but tickle. In place of emotion, he met with\r\nmockery. He sobbed; they burst into gaiety, and under that gaiety he had\r\nsunk fatally submerged.\r\n\r\nAnd what had they laughed at? At his laugh. So that trace of a hateful\r\nact, of which he must keep the mark for ever--mutilation carved in\r\neverlasting gaiety; the stigmata of laughter, image of the sham\r\ncontentment of nations under their oppressors; that mask of joy produced\r\nby torture; that abyss of grimace which he carried on his features; the\r\nscar which signified _Jussu regis_, the attestation of a crime committed\r\nby the king towards him, and the symbol of crime committed by royalty\r\ntowards the people;--that it was which had triumphed over him; that it\r\nwas which had overwhelmed him; so that the accusation against the\r\nexecutioner turned into sentence upon the victim. What a prodigious\r\ndenial of justice! Royalty, having had satisfaction of his father, had\r\nhad satisfaction of him! The evil that had been done had served as\r\npretext and as motive for the evil which remained to be done. Against\r\nwhom were the lords angered? Against the torturer? No; against the\r\ntortured. Here is the throne; there, the people. Here, James II.; there,\r\nGwynplaine. That confrontation, indeed, brought to light an outrage and\r\na crime. What was the outrage? Complaint. What was the crime? Suffering.\r\nLet misery hide itself in silence, otherwise it becomes treason. And\r\nthose men who had dragged Gwynplaine on the hurdle of sarcasm, were they\r\nwicked? No; but they, too, had their fatality--they were happy. They\r\nwere executioners, ignorant of the fact. They were good-humoured; they\r\nsaw no use in Gwynplaine. He opened himself to them. He tore out his\r\nheart to show them, and they cried, “Go on with your play!” But,\r\nsharpest sting! he had laughed himself. The frightful chain which tied\r\ndown his soul hindered his thoughts from rising to his face. His\r\ndisfigurement reached even his senses; and, while his conscience was\r\nindignant, his face gave it the lie, and jested. Then all was over. He\r\nwas the laughing man, the caryatid of the weeping world. He was an agony\r\npetrified in hilarity, carrying the weight of a universe of calamity,\r\nand walled up for ever with the gaiety, the ridicule, and the amusement\r\nof others; of all the oppressed, of whom he was the incarnation, he\r\npartook the hateful fate, to be a desolation not believed in; they\r\njeered at his distress; to them he was but an extraordinary buffoon\r\nlifted out of some frightful condensation of misery, escaped from his\r\nprison, changed to a deity, risen from the dregs of the people to the\r\nfoot of the throne, mingling with the stars, and who, having once amused\r\nthe damned, now amused the elect. All that was in him of generosity, of\r\nenthusiasm, of eloquence, of heart, of soul, of fury, of anger, of love,\r\nof inexpressible grief, ended in--a burst of laughter! And he proved, as\r\nhe had told the lords, that this was not the exception; but that it was\r\nthe normal, ordinary, universal, unlimited, sovereign fact, so\r\namalgamated with the routine of life that they took no account of it.\r\nThe hungry pauper laughs, the beggar laughs, the felon laughs, the\r\nprostitute laughs, the orphan laughs to gain his bread; the slave\r\nlaughs, the soldier laughs, the people laugh. Society is so constituted\r\nthat every perdition, every indigence, every catastrophe, every fever,\r\nevery ulcer, every agony, is resolved on the surface of the abyss into\r\none frightful grin of joy. Now he was that universal grin, and that grin\r\nwas himself. The law of heaven, the unknown power which governs, had\r\nwilled that a spectre visible and palpable, a spectre of flesh and bone,\r\nshould be the synopsis of the monstrous parody which we call the world;\r\nand he was that spectre, immutable fate!\r\n\r\nHe had cried, “Pity for those who suffer.” In vain! He had striven to\r\nawake pity; he had awakened horror. Such is the law of apparitions.\r\n\r\nBut while he was a spectre, he was also a man; here was the heartrending\r\ncomplication. A spectre without, a man within. A man more than any\r\nother, perhaps, since his double fate was the synopsis of all humanity.\r\nAnd he felt that humanity was at once present in him and absent from\r\nhim. There was in his existence something insurmountable. What was he? A\r\ndisinherited heir? No; for he was a lord. Was he a lord? No; for he was\r\na rebel. He was the light-bearer; a terrible spoil-sport. He was not\r\nSatan, certainly; but he was Lucifer. His entrance, with his torch in\r\nhis hand, was sinister.\r\n\r\nSinister for whom? for the sinister. Terrible to whom? to the terrible.\r\nTherefore they rejected him. Enter their order? be accepted by them?\r\nNever. The obstacle which he carried in his face was frightful; but the\r\nobstacle which he carried in his ideas was still more insurmountable.\r\nHis speech was to them more deformed than his face. He had no possible\r\nthought in common with the world of the great and powerful, in which he\r\nhad by a freak of fate been born, and from which another freak of fate\r\nhad driven him out. There was between men and his face a mask, and\r\nbetween society and his mind a wall. In mixing, from infancy, a\r\nwandering mountebank, with that vast and tough substance which is called\r\nthe crowd, in saturating himself with the attraction of the multitude,\r\nand impregnating himself with the great soul of mankind, he had lost, in\r\nthe common sense of the whole of mankind, the particular sense of the\r\nreigning classes. On their heights he was impossible. He had reached\r\nthem wet with water from the well of Truth; the odour of the abyss was\r\non him. He was repugnant to those princes perfumed with lies. To those\r\nwho live on fiction, truth is disgusting; and he who thirsts for\r\nflattery vomits the real, when he has happened to drink it by mistake.\r\nThat which Gwynplaine brought was not fit for their table. For what was\r\nit? Reason, wisdom, justice; and they rejected them with disgust.\r\n\r\nThere were bishops there. He brought God into their presence. Who was\r\nthis intruder?\r\n\r\nThe two poles repel each other. They can never amalgamate, for\r\ntransition is wanting. Hence the result--a cry of anger--when they were\r\nbrought together in terrible juxtaposition: all misery concentrated in a\r\nman, face to face with all pride concentrated in a caste.\r\n\r\nTo accuse is useless. To state is sufficient. Gwynplaine, meditating on\r\nthe limits of his destiny, proved the total uselessness of his effort.\r\nHe proved the deafness of high places. The privileged have no hearing on\r\nthe side next the disinherited. Is it their fault? Alas! no. It is their\r\nlaw. Forgive them! To be moved would be to abdicate. Of lords and\r\nprinces expect nothing. He who is satisfied is inexorable. For those\r\nthat have their fill the hungry do not exist. The happy ignore and\r\nisolate themselves. On the threshold of their paradise, as on the\r\nthreshold of hell, must be written, “Leave all hope behind.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine had met with the reception of a spectre entering the dwelling\r\nof the gods.\r\n\r\nHere all that was within him rose in rebellion. No, he was no spectre;\r\nhe was a man. He told them, he shouted to them, that he was Man.\r\n\r\nHe was not a phantom. He was palpitating flesh. He had a brain, and he\r\nthought; he had a heart, and he loved; he had a soul, and he hoped.\r\nIndeed, to have hoped overmuch was his whole crime.\r\n\r\nAlas! he had exaggerated hope into believing in that thing at once so\r\nbrilliant and so dark which is called Society. He who was without had\r\nre-entered it. It had at once, and at first sight, made him its three\r\noffers, and given him its three gifts--marriage, family, and caste.\r\nMarriage? He had seen prostitution on the threshold. Family? His brother\r\nhad struck him, and was awaiting him the next day, sword in hand. Caste?\r\nIt had burst into laughter in his face, at him the patrician, at him the\r\nwretch. It had rejected, almost before it had admitted him. So that his\r\nfirst three steps into the dense shadow of society had opened three\r\ngulfs beneath him.\r\n\r\nAnd it was by a treacherous transfiguration that his disaster had begun;\r\nand catastrophe had approached him with the aspect of apotheosis!\r\n\r\nAscend had signified Descend!\r\n\r\nHis fate was the reverse of Job’s. It was through prosperity that\r\nadversity had reached him.\r\n\r\nO tragical enigma of life! Behold what pitfalls! A child, he had\r\nwrestled against the night, and had been stronger than it; a man, he had\r\nwrestled against destiny, and had overcome it. Out of disfigurement he\r\nhad created success; and out of misery, happiness. Of his exile he had\r\nmade an asylum. A vagabond, he had wrestled against space; and, like the\r\nbirds of the air, he had found his crumb of bread. Wild and solitary, he\r\nhad wrestled against the crowd, and had made it his friend. An athlete,\r\nhe had wrestled against that lion, the people; and he had tamed it.\r\nIndigent, he had wrestled against distress, he had faced the dull\r\nnecessity of living, and from amalgamating with misery every joy of his\r\nheart, he had at length made riches out of poverty. He had believed\r\nhimself the conqueror of life. Of a sudden he was attacked by fresh\r\nforces, reaching him from unknown depths; this time, with menaces no\r\nlonger, but with smiles and caresses. Love, serpent-like and sensual,\r\nhad appeared to him, who was filled with angelic love. The flesh had\r\ntempted him, who had lived on the ideal. He had heard words of\r\nvoluptuousness like cries of rage; he had felt the clasp of a woman’s\r\narms, like the convolutions of a snake; to the illumination of truth had\r\nsucceeded the fascination of falsehood; for it is not the flesh that is\r\nreal, but the soul. The flesh is ashes, the soul is flame. For the\r\nlittle circle allied to him by the relationship of poverty and toil,\r\nwhich was his true and natural family, had been substituted the social\r\nfamily--his family in blood, but of tainted blood; and even before he\r\nhad entered it, he found himself face to face with an intended\r\nfractricide. Alas! he had allowed himself to be thrown back into that\r\nsociety of which Brantôme, whom he had not read, wrote: “_The son has a\r\nright to challenge his father!_” A fatal fortune had cried to him, “Thou\r\nart not of the crowd; thou art of the chosen!” and had opened the\r\nceiling above his head, like a trap in the sky, and had shot him up,\r\nthrough this opening, causing him to appear, wild, and unexpected, in\r\nthe midst of princes and masters. Then suddenly he saw around him,\r\ninstead of the people who applauded him, the lords who cursed him.\r\nMournful metamorphosis! Ignominious ennobling! Rude spoliation of all\r\nthat had been his happiness! Pillage of his life by derision!\r\nGwynplaine, Clancharlie, the lord, the mountebank, torn out of his old\r\nlot, out of his new lot, by the beaks of those eagles!\r\n\r\nWhat availed it that he had commenced life by immediate victory over\r\nobstacle? Of what good had been his early triumphs? Alas! the fall must\r\ncome, ere destiny be complete.\r\n\r\nSo, half against his will, half of it--because after he had done with\r\nthe wapentake he had to do with Barkilphedro, and he had given a certain\r\namount of consent to his abductions--he had left the real for the\r\nchimerical; the true for the false; Dea for Josiana; love for pride;\r\nliberty for power; labour proud and poor for opulence full of unknown\r\nresponsibilities; the shade in which is God for the lurid flames in\r\nwhich the devils dwell; Paradise for Olympus!\r\n\r\nHe had tasted the golden fruit. He was now spitting out the ashes to\r\nwhich it turned.\r\n\r\nLamentable result! Defeat, failure, fall into ruin, insolent expulsion\r\nof all his hopes, frustrated by ridicule. Immeasurable disillusion! And\r\nwhat was there for him in the future? If he looked forward to the\r\nmorrow, what did he see? A drawn sword, the point of which was against\r\nhis breast, and the hilt in the hand of his brother. He could see\r\nnothing but the hideous flash of that sword. Josiana and the House of\r\nLords made up the background in a monstrous chiaroscuro full of tragic\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\nAnd that brother seemed so brave and chivalrous! Alas! he had hardly\r\nseen the Tom-Jim-Jack who had defended Gwynplaine, the Lord David who\r\nhad defended Lord Clancharlie; but he had had time to receive a blow\r\nfrom him and to love him.\r\n\r\nHe was crushed.\r\n\r\nHe felt it impossible to proceed further. Everything had crumbled about\r\nhim. Besides, what was the good of it? All weariness dwells in the\r\ndepths of despair.\r\n\r\nThe trial had been made. It could not be renewed.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine was like a gamester who has played all his trumps away, one\r\nafter the other. He had allowed himself to be drawn to a fearful\r\ngambling-table, without thinking what he was about; for, so subtle is\r\nthe poison of illusion, he had staked Dea against Josiana, and had\r\ngained a monster; he had staked Ursus against a family, and had gained\r\nan insult; he had played his mountebank platform against his seat in the\r\nLords; for the applause which was his he had gained insult. His last\r\ncard had fallen on that fatal green cloth, the deserted bowling-green.\r\nGwynplaine had lost. Nothing remained but to pay. Pay up, wretched man!\r\n\r\nThe thunder-stricken lie still. Gwynplaine remained motionless. Anybody\r\nperceiving him from afar, in the shadow, stiff, and without movement,\r\nmight have fancied that he saw an upright stone.\r\n\r\nHell, the serpent, and reverie are tortuous. Gwynplaine was descending\r\nthe sepulchral spirals of the deepest thought.\r\n\r\nHe reflected on that world of which he had just caught a glimpse with\r\nthe icy contemplation of a last look. Marriage, but no love; family, but\r\nno brotherly affection; riches, but no conscience; beauty, but no\r\nmodesty; justice, but no equity; order, but no equilibrium; authority,\r\nbut no right; power, but no intelligence; splendour, but no light.\r\nInexorable balance-sheet! He went throughout the supreme vision in which\r\nhis mind had been plunged. He examined successively destiny, situation,\r\nsociety, and himself. What was destiny? A snare. Situation? Despair.\r\nSociety? Hatred. And himself? A defeated man. In the depths of his soul\r\nhe cried. Society is the stepmother, Nature is the mother. Society is\r\nthe world of the body, Nature is the world of the soul. The one tends to\r\nthe coffin, to the deal box in the grave, to the earth-worms, and ends\r\nthere. The other tends to expanded wings, to transformation into the\r\nmorning light, to ascent into the firmament, and there revives into new\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBy degrees a paroxysm came over him, like a sweeping surge. At the close\r\nof events there is always a last flash, in which all stands revealed\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nHe who judges meets the accused face to face. Gwynplaine reviewed all\r\nthat society and all that nature had done for him. How kind had nature\r\nbeen to him! How she, who is the soul, had succoured him! All had been\r\ntaken from him, even his features. The soul had given him all back--all,\r\neven his features; because there was on earth a heavenly blind girl made\r\nexpressly for him, who saw not his ugliness, and who saw his beauty.\r\n\r\nAnd it was from this that he had allowed himself to be separated--from\r\nthat adorable girl, from his own adopted one, from her tenderness, from\r\nher divine blind gaze, the only gaze on earth that saw him, that he had\r\nstrayed! Dea was his sister, because he felt between them the grand\r\nfraternity of above--the mystery which contains the whole of heaven.\r\nDea, when he was a little child, was his virgin; because every child has\r\nhis virgin, and at the commencement of life a marriage of souls is\r\nalways consummated in the plenitude of innocence. Dea was his wife, for\r\ntheirs was the same nest on the highest branch of the deep-rooted tree\r\nof Hymen. Dea was still more--she was his light, for without her all was\r\nvoid, and nothingness; and for him her head was crowned with rays. What\r\nwould become of him without Dea? What could he do with all that was\r\nhimself? Nothing in him could live without her. How, then, could he have\r\nlost sight of her for a moment? O unfortunate man! He allowed distance\r\nto intervene between himself and his star and, by the unknown and\r\nterrible laws of gravitation in such things, distance is immediate loss.\r\n\r\nWhere was she, the star? Dea! Dea! Dea! Dea! Alas! he had lost her\r\nlight. Take away the star, and what is the sky? A black mass. But why,\r\nthen, had all this befallen him? Oh, what happiness had been his! For\r\nhim God had remade Eden. Too close was the resemblance, alas! even to\r\nallowing the serpent to enter; but this time it was the man who had been\r\ntempted. He had been drawn without, and then, by a frightful snare, had\r\nfallen into a chaos of murky laughter, which was hell. O grief! O grief!\r\nHow frightful seemed all that had fascinated him! That Josiana, fearful\r\ncreature!--half beast, half goddess! Gwynplaine was now on the reverse\r\nside of his elevation, and he saw the other aspect of that which had\r\ndazzled him. It was baleful. His peerage was deformed, his coronet was\r\nhideous; his purple robe, a funeral garment; those palaces, infected;\r\nthose trophies, those statues, those armorial bearings, sinister; the\r\nunwholesome and treacherous air poisoned those who breathed it, and\r\nturned them mad. How brilliant the rags of the mountebank, Gwynplaine,\r\nappeared to him now! Alas! where was the Green Box, poverty, joy, the\r\nsweet wandering life--wandering together, like the swallows? They never\r\nleft each other then; he saw her every minute, morning, evening. At\r\ntable their knees, their elbows, touched; they drank from the same cup;\r\nthe sun shone through the pane, but it was only the sun, and Dea was\r\nLove. At night they slept not far from each other; and the dream of Dea\r\ncame and hovered over Gwynplaine, and the dream of Gwynplaine spread\r\nitself mysteriously above the head of Dea. When they awoke they could be\r\nnever quite sure that they had not exchanged kisses in the azure mists\r\nof dreams. Dea was all innocence; Ursus, all wisdom. They wandered from\r\ntown to town; and they had for provision and for stimulant the frank,\r\nloving gaiety of the people. They were angel vagabonds, with enough of\r\nhumanity to walk the earth and not enough of wings to fly away; and now\r\nall had disappeared! Where was it gone? Was it possible that it was all\r\neffaced? What wind from the tomb had swept over them? All was eclipsed!\r\nAll was lost! Alas! power, irresistible and deaf to appeal, which weighs\r\ndown the poor, flings its shadow over all, and is capable of anything.\r\nWhat had been done to them? And he had not been there to protect them,\r\nto fling himself in front of them, to defend them, as a lord, with his\r\ntitle, his peerage, and his sword; as a mountebank, with his fists and\r\nhis nails!\r\n\r\nAnd here arose a bitter reflection, perhaps the most bitter of all.\r\nWell, no; he could not have defended them. It was he himself who had\r\ndestroyed them; it was to save him, Lord Clancharlie, from them; it was\r\nto isolate his dignity from contact with them, that the infamous\r\nomnipotence of society had crushed them. The best way in which he could\r\nprotect them would be to disappear, and then the cause of their\r\npersecution would cease. He out of the way, they would be allowed to\r\nremain in peace. Into what icy channel was his thought beginning to run!\r\nOh! why had he allowed himself to be separated from Dea? Was not his\r\nfirst duty towards her? To serve and to defend the people? But Dea was\r\nthe people. Dea was an orphan. She was blind; she represented humanity.\r\nOh! what had they done to them? Cruel smart of regret! His absence had\r\nleft the field free for the catastrophe. He would have shared their\r\nfate; either they would have been taken and carried away with him, or he\r\nwould have been swallowed up with them. And, now, what would become of\r\nhim without them? Gwynplaine without Dea! Was it possible? Without Dea\r\nwas to be without everything. It was all over now. The beloved group was\r\nfor ever buried in irreparable disappearance. All was spent. Besides,\r\ncondemned and damned as Gwynplaine was, what was the good of further\r\nstruggle? He had nothing more to expect either of men or of heaven. Dea!\r\nDea! Where is Dea? Lost! What? lost? He who has lost his soul can regain\r\nit but through one outlet--death.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, tragically distraught, placed his hand firmly on the\r\nparapet, as on a solution, and looked at the river.\r\n\r\nIt was his third night without sleep. Fever had come over him. His\r\nthoughts, which he believed to be clear, were blurred. He felt an\r\nimperative need of sleep. He remained for a few instants leaning over\r\nthe water. Its darkness offered him a bed of boundless tranquillity in\r\nthe infinity of shadow. Sinister temptation!\r\n\r\nHe took off his coat, which he folded and placed on the parapet; then he\r\nunbuttoned his waistcoat. As he was about to take it off, his hand\r\nstruck against something in the pocket. It was the red book which had\r\nbeen given him by the librarian of the House of Lords: he drew it from\r\nthe pocket, examined it in the vague light of the night, and found a\r\npencil in it, with which he wrote on the first blank that he found these\r\ntwo lines,--\r\n\r\n“I depart. Let my brother David take my place, and may he be happy!”\r\n\r\nThen he signed, “Fermain Clancharlie, peer of England.”\r\n\r\nHe took off his waistcoat and placed it upon the coat; then his hat,\r\nwhich he placed upon the waistcoat. In the hat he laid the red book open\r\nat the page on which he had written. Seeing a stone lying on the ground,\r\nhe picked it up and placed it in the hat. Having done all this, he\r\nlooked up into the deep shadow above him. Then his head sank slowly, as\r\nif drawn by an invisible thread towards the abyss.\r\n\r\nThere was a hole in the masonry near the base of the parapet; he placed\r\nhis foot in it, so that his knee stood higher than the top, and scarcely\r\nan effort was necessary to spring over it. He clasped his hands behind\r\nhis back and leaned over. “So be it,” said he.\r\n\r\nAnd he fixed his eyes on the deep waters. Just then he felt a tongue\r\nlicking his hands.\r\n\r\nHe shuddered, and turned round.\r\n\r\nHomo was behind him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n_THE NIGHT AND THE SEA._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nA WATCH-DOG MAY BE A GUARDIAN ANGEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nGwynplaine uttered a cry.\r\n\r\n“Is that you, wolf?”\r\n\r\nHomo wagged his tail. His eyes sparkled in the darkness. He was looking\r\nearnestly at Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nThen he began to lick his hands again. For a moment Gwynplaine was like\r\na drunken man, so great is the shock of Hope’s mighty return.\r\n\r\nHomo! What an apparition! During the last forty-eight hours he had\r\nexhausted what might be termed every variety of the thunder-bolt. But\r\none was left to strike him--the thunderbolt of joy. And it had just\r\nfallen upon him. Certainty, or at least the light which leads to it,\r\nregained; the sudden intervention of some mysterious clemency possessed,\r\nperhaps, by destiny; life saying, “Behold me!” in the darkest recess of\r\nthe grave; the very moment in which all expectation has ceased bringing\r\nback health and deliverance; a place of safety discovered at the most\r\ncritical instant in the midst of crumbling ruins--Homo was all this to\r\nGwynplaine. The wolf appeared to him in a halo of light.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Homo had turned round. He advanced a few steps, and then\r\nlooked back to see if Gwynplaine was following him.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine was doing so. Homo wagged his tail, and went on.\r\n\r\nThe road taken by the wolf was the slope of the quay of the\r\nEffroc-stone. This slope shelved down to the Thames; and Gwynplaine,\r\nguided by Homo, descended it.\r\n\r\nHomo turned his head now and then, to make sure that Gwynplaine was\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nIn some situations of supreme importance nothing approaches so near an\r\nomniscient intelligence as the simple instinct of a faithful animal. An\r\nanimal is a lucid somnambulist.\r\n\r\nThere are cases in which the dog feels that he should follow his master;\r\nothers, in which he should precede him. Then the animal takes the\r\ndirection of sense. His imperturbable scent is a confused power of\r\nvision in what is twilight to us. He feels a vague obligation to become\r\na guide. Does he know that there is a dangerous pass, and that he can\r\nhelp his master to surmount it? Probably not. Perhaps he does. In any\r\ncase, some one knows it for him. As we have already said, it often\r\nhappens in life that some mighty help which we have held to have come\r\nfrom below has, in reality, come from above. Who knows all the\r\nmysterious forms assumed by God?\r\n\r\nWhat was this animal? Providence.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the river, the wolf led down the narrow tongue of land\r\nwhich bordered the Thames.\r\n\r\nWithout noise or bark he pushed forward on his silent way. Homo always\r\nfollowed his instinct and did his duty, but with the pensive reserve of\r\nan outlaw.\r\n\r\nSome fifty paces more, and he stopped. A wooden platform appeared on the\r\nright. At the bottom of this platform, which was a kind of wharf on\r\npiles, a black mass could be made out, which was a tolerably large\r\nvessel. On the deck of the vessel, near the prow, was a glimmer, like\r\nthe last flicker of a night-light.\r\n\r\nThe wolf, having finally assured himself that Gwynplaine was there,\r\nbounded on to the wharf. It was a long platform, floored and tarred,\r\nsupported by a network of joists, and under which flowed the river. Homo\r\nand Gwynplaine shortly reached the brink.\r\n\r\nThe ship moored to the wharf was a Dutch vessel, of the Japanese build,\r\nwith two decks, fore and aft, and between them an open hold, reached by\r\nan upright ladder, in which the cargo was laden. There was thus a\r\nforecastle and an afterdeck, as in our old river boats, and a space\r\nbetween them ballasted by the freight. The paper boats made by children\r\nare of a somewhat similar shape. Under the decks were the cabins, the\r\ndoors of which opened into the hold and were lighted by glazed\r\nportholes. In stowing the cargo a passage was left between the packages\r\nof which it consisted. These vessels had a mast on each deck. The\r\nforemast was called Paul, the mainmast Peter--the ship being sailed by\r\nthese two masts, as the Church was guided by her two apostles. A gangway\r\nwas thrown, like a Chinese bridge, from one deck to the other, over the\r\ncentre of the hold. In bad weather, both flaps of the gangway were\r\nlowered, on the right and left, on hinges, thus making a roof over the\r\nhold; so that the ship, in heavy seas, was hermetically closed. These\r\nsloops, being of very massive construction, had a beam for a tiller, the\r\nstrength of the rudder being necessarily proportioned to the height of\r\nthe vessel. Three men, the skipper and two sailors, with a cabin-boy,\r\nsufficed to navigate these ponderous sea-going machines. The decks, fore\r\nand aft, were, as we have already said, without bulwarks. The great\r\nlumbering hull of this particular vessel was painted black, and on it,\r\nvisible even in the night, stood out, in white letters, the words,\r\n_Vograat, Rotterdam_.\r\n\r\nAbout that time many events had occurred at sea, and amongst others, the\r\ndefeat of the Baron de Pointi’s eight ships off Cape Carnero, which had\r\ndriven the whole French fleet into refuge at Gibraltar; so that the\r\nChannel was swept of every man-of-war, and merchant vessels were able to\r\nsail backwards and forwards between London and Rotterdam, without a\r\nconvoy.\r\n\r\nThe vessel on which was to be read the word _Vograat_, and which\r\nGwynplaine was now close to, lay with her main-deck almost level with\r\nthe wharf. But one step to descend, and Homo in a bound, and Gwynplaine\r\nin a stride, were on board.\r\n\r\nThe deck was clear, and no stir was perceptible. The passengers, if, as\r\nwas likely, there were any, were already on board, the vessel being\r\nready to sail, and the cargo stowed, as was apparent from the state of\r\nthe hold, which was full of bales and cases. But they were, doubtless,\r\nlying asleep in the cabins below, as the passage was to take place\r\nduring the night. In such cases the passengers do not appear on deck\r\ntill they awake the following morning. As for the crew, they were\r\nprobably having their supper in the men’s cabin, whilst awaiting the\r\nhour fixed for sailing, which was now rapidly approaching. Hence the\r\nsilence on the two decks connected by the gangway.\r\n\r\nThe wolf had almost run across the wharf; once on board, he slackened\r\nhis pace into a discreet walk. He still wagged his tail--no longer\r\njoyfully, however, but with the sad and feeble wag of a dog troubled in\r\nhis mind. Still preceding Gwynplaine, he passed along the after-deck,\r\nand across the gangway.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, having reached the gangway, perceived a light in front of\r\nhim. It was the same that he had seen from the shore. There was a\r\nlantern on the deck, close to the foremast, by the gleam of which was\r\nsketched in black, on the dim background of the night, what Gwynplaine\r\nrecognized to be Ursus’s old four-wheeled van.\r\n\r\nThis poor wooden tenement, cart and hut combined, in which his childhood\r\nhad rolled along, was fastened to the bottom of the mast by thick ropes,\r\nof which the knots were visible at the wheels. Having been so long out\r\nof service, it had become dreadfully rickety; it leant over feebly on\r\none side; it had become quite paralytic from disuse; and, moreover, it\r\nwas suffering from that incurable malady--old age. Mouldy and out of\r\nshape, it tottered in decay. The materials of which it was built were\r\nall rotten. The iron was rusty, the leather torn, the wood-work\r\nworm-eaten. There were lines of cracks across the window in front,\r\nthrough which shone a ray from the lantern. The wheels were warped. The\r\nlining, the floor, and the axletrees seemed worn out with fatigue.\r\nAltogether, it presented an indescribable appearance of beggary and\r\nprostration. The shafts, stuck up, looked like two arms raised to\r\nheaven. The whole thing was in a state of dislocation. Beneath it was\r\nhanging Homo’s chain.\r\n\r\nDoes it not seem that the law and the will of nature would have dictated\r\nGwynplaine’s headlong rush to throw himself upon life, happiness, love\r\nregained? So they would, except in some case of deep terror such as his.\r\nBut he who comes forth, shattered in nerve and uncertain of his way,\r\nfrom a series of catastrophes, each one like a fresh betrayal, is\r\nprudent even in his joy; hesitates, lest he should bear the fatality of\r\nwhich he has been the victim to those whom he loves; feels that some\r\nevil contagion may still hang about him, and advances towards happiness\r\nwith wary steps. The gates of Paradise reopen; but before he enters he\r\nexamines his ground.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, staggering under the weight of his emotion, looked around\r\nhim, while the wolf went and lay down silently by his chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nBARKILPHEDRO, HAVING AIMED AT THE EAGLE, BRINGS DOWN THE DOVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe step of the little van was down--the door ajar--there was no one\r\ninside. The faint light which broke through the pane in front sketched\r\nthe interior of the caravan vaguely in melancholy chiaroscuro. The\r\ninscriptions of Ursus, gloryifying the grandeur of Lords, showed\r\ndistinctly on the worn-out boards, which were both the wall without and\r\nthe wainscot within. On a nail, near the door, Gwynplaine saw his\r\nesclavine and his cape hung up, as they hang up the clothes of a corpse\r\nin a dead-house. Just then he had neither waistcoat nor coat on.\r\n\r\nBehind the van something was laid out on the deck at the foot of the\r\nmast, which was lighted by the lantern. It was a mattress, of which he\r\ncould make out one corner. On this mattress some one was probably lying,\r\nfor he could see a shadow move.\r\n\r\nSome one was speaking. Concealed by the van, Gwynplaine listened. It was\r\nUrsus’s voice. That voice, so harsh in its upper, so tender in its\r\nlower, pitch; that voice, which had so often upbraided Gwynplaine, and\r\nwhich had taught him so well, had lost the life and clearness of its\r\ntone. It was vague and low, and melted into a sigh at the end of every\r\nsentence. It bore but a confused resemblance to his natural and firm\r\nvoice of old. It was the voice of one in whom happiness is dead. A voice\r\nmay become a ghost.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be engaged in monologue rather than in conversation. We are\r\nalready aware, however, that soliloquy was a habit with him. It was for\r\nthat reason that he passed for a madman.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine held his breath, so as not to lose a word of what Ursus\r\nsaid, and this was what he heard.\r\n\r\n“This is a very dangerous kind of craft, because there are no bulwarks\r\nto it. If we were to slip, there is nothing to prevent our going\r\noverboard. If we have bad weather, we shall have to take her below, and\r\nthat will be dreadful. An awkward step, a fright, and we shall have a\r\nrupture of the aneurism. I have seen instances of it. O my God! what is\r\nto become of us? Is she asleep? Yes. She is asleep. Is she in a swoon?\r\nNo. Her pulse is pretty strong. She is only asleep. Sleep is a reprieve.\r\nIt is the happy blindness. What can I do to prevent people walking about\r\nhere? Gentlemen, if there be anybody on deck, I beg of you to make no\r\nnoise. Do not come near us, if you do not mind. You know a person in\r\ndelicate health requires a little attention. She is feverish, you see.\r\nShe is very young. ’Tis a little creature who is rather feverish. I put\r\nthis mattress down here so that she may have a little air. I explain all\r\nthis so that you should be careful. She fell down exhausted on the\r\nmattress as if she had fainted. But she is asleep. I do hope that no one\r\nwill awake her. I address myself to the ladies, if there are any\r\npresent. A young girl, it is pitiful! We are only poor mountebanks, but\r\nI beg a little kindness, and if there is anything to pay for not making\r\na noise, I will pay it. I thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Is there any\r\none there? No? I don’t think there is. My talk is mere loss of breath.\r\nSo much the better. Gentlemen, I thank you, if you are there; and I\r\nthank you still more if you are not. Her forehead is all in\r\nperspiration. Come, let us take our places in the galleys again. Put on\r\nthe chain. Misery is come back. We are sinking again. A hand, the\r\nfearful hand which we cannot see, but the weight of which we feel ever\r\nupon us, has suddenly struck us back towards the dark point of our\r\ndestiny. Be it so. We will bear up. Only I will not have her ill. I must\r\nseem a fool to talk aloud like this, when I am alone; but she must feel\r\nshe has some one near her when she awakes. What shall I do if somebody\r\nawakes her suddenly! No noise, in the name of Heaven! A sudden shock\r\nwhich would awake her suddenly would be of no use. It will be a pity if\r\nanybody comes by. I believe that every one on board is asleep. Thanks be\r\nto Providence for that mercy. Well, and Homo? Where is he, I wonder? In\r\nall this confusion I forgot to tie him up. I do not know what I am\r\ndoing. It is more than an hour since I have seen him. I suppose he has\r\nbeen to look for his supper somewhere ashore. I hope nothing has\r\nhappened to him. Homo! Homo!”\r\n\r\nHomo struck his tail softly on the planks of the deck.\r\n\r\n“You are there. Oh! you are there! Thank God for that. If Homo had been\r\nlost, it would have been too much to bear. She has moved her arm.\r\nPerhaps she is going to awake. Quiet, Homo! The tide is turning. We\r\nshall sail directly. I think it will be a fine night. There is no wind:\r\nthe flag droops. We shall have a good passage. I do not know what moon\r\nit is, but there is scarcely a stir in the clouds. There will be no\r\nswell. It will be a fine night. Her cheek is pale; it is only weakness!\r\nNo, it is flushed; it is only the fever. Stay! It is rosy. She is well!\r\nI can no longer see clearly. My poor Homo, I no longer see distinctly.\r\nSo we must begin life afresh. We must set to work again. There are only\r\nwe two left, you see. We will work for her, both of us! She is our\r\nchild, Ah! the vessel moves! We are off! Good-bye, London! Good evening!\r\ngood-night! To the devil with horrible London!”\r\n\r\nHe was right. He heard the dull sound of the unmooring as the vessel\r\nfell away from the wharf. Abaft on the poop a man, the skipper, no\r\ndoubt, just come from below, was standing. He had slipped the hawser and\r\nwas working the tiller. Looking only to the rudder, as befitted the\r\ncombined phlegm of a Dutchman and a sailor, listening to nothing but the\r\nwind and the water, bending against the resistance of the tiller, as he\r\nworked it to port or starboard, he looked in the gloom of the after-deck\r\nlike a phantom bearing a beam upon its shoulder. He was alone there. So\r\nlong as they were in the river the other sailors were not required. In a\r\nfew minutes the vessel was in the centre of the current, with which she\r\ndrifted without rolling or pitching. The Thames, little disturbed by the\r\nebb, was calm. Carried onwards by the tide, the vessel made rapid way.\r\nBehind her the black scenery of London was fading in the mist.\r\n\r\nUrsus went on talking.\r\n\r\n“Never mind, I will give her digitalis. I am afraid that delirium will\r\nsupervene. She perspires in the palms of her hands. What sin can we have\r\ncommitted in the sight of God? How quickly has all this misery come upon\r\nus! Hideous rapidity of evil! A stone falls. It has claws. It is the\r\nhawk swooping on the lark. It is destiny. There you lie, my sweet child!\r\nOne comes to London. One says: What a fine city! What fine buildings!\r\nSouthwark is a magnificent suburb. One settles there. But now they are\r\nhorrid places. What would you have me do there? I am going to leave.\r\nThis is the 30th of April. I always distrusted the month of April. There\r\nare but two lucky days in April, the 5th and the 27th; and four unlucky\r\nones--the 10th, the 20th, the 29th, and the 30th. This has been placed\r\nbeyond doubt by the calculations of Cardan. I wish this day were over.\r\nDeparture is a comfort. At dawn we shall be at Gravesend, and to-morrow\r\nevening at Rotterdam. Zounds! I will begin life again in the van. We\r\nwill draw it, won’t we, Homo?”\r\n\r\nA light tapping announced the wolf’s consent.\r\n\r\nUrsus continued,--\r\n\r\n“If one could only get out of a grief as one gets out of a city! Homo,\r\nwe must yet be happy. Alas! there must always be the one who is no more.\r\nA shadow remains on those who survive. You know whom I mean, Homo. We\r\nwere four, and now we are but three. Life is but a long loss of those\r\nwhom we love. They leave behind them a train of sorrows. Destiny amazes\r\nus by a prolixity of unbearable suffering; who then can wonder that the\r\nold are garrulous? It is despair that makes the dotard, old fellow!\r\nHomo, the wind continues favourable. We can no longer see the dome of\r\nSt. Paul’s. We shall pass Greenwich presently. That will be six good\r\nmiles over. Oh! I turn my back for ever on those odious capitals, full\r\nof priests, of magistrates, and of people. I prefer looking at the\r\nleaves rustling in the woods. Her forehead is still in perspiration. I\r\ndon’t like those great violet veins in her arm. There is fever in them.\r\nOh! all this is killing me. Sleep, my child. Yes; she sleeps.”\r\n\r\nHere a voice spoke: an ineffable voice, which seemed from afar, and\r\nappeared to come at once from the heights and the depths--a voice\r\ndivinely fearful, the voice of Dea.\r\n\r\nAll that Gwynplaine had hitherto felt seemed nothing. His angel spoke.\r\nIt seemed as though he heard words spoken from another world in a\r\nheaven-like trance.\r\n\r\nThe voice said,--\r\n\r\n“He did well to go. This world was not worthy of him. Only I must go\r\nwith him. Father! I am not ill; I heard you speak just now. I am very\r\nwell, quite well. I was asleep. Father, I am going to be happy.”\r\n\r\n“My child,” said Ursus in a voice of anguish, “what do you mean by\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\nThe answer was,--\r\n\r\n“Father, do not be unhappy.”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, as if to take breath, and then these few words,\r\npronounced slowly, reached Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine is no longer here. It is now that I am blind. I knew not\r\nwhat night was. Night is absence.”\r\n\r\nThe voice stopped once more, and then continued,--\r\n\r\n“I always feared that he would fly away. I felt that he belonged to\r\nheaven. He has taken flight suddenly. It was natural that it should end\r\nthus. The soul flies away like a bird. But the nest of the soul is in\r\nthe height, where dwells the Great Loadstone, who draws all towards Him.\r\nI know where to find Gwynplaine. I have no doubt about the way. Father,\r\nit is yonder. Later on, you will rejoin us, and Homo, too.”\r\n\r\nHomo, hearing his name pronounced, wagged his tail softly against the\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\n“Father!” resumed the voice, “you understand that once Gwynplaine is no\r\nlonger here, all is over. Even if I would remain, I could not, because\r\none must breathe. We must not ask for that which is impossible. I was\r\nwith Gwynplaine. It was quite natural, I lived. Now Gwynplaine is no\r\nmore, I die. The two things are alike: either he must come or I must go.\r\nSince he cannot come back, I am going to him. It is good to die. It is\r\nnot at all difficult. Father, that which is extinguished here shall be\r\nrekindled elsewhere. It is a heartache to live in this world. It cannot\r\nbe that we shall always be unhappy. When we go to what you call the\r\nstars, we shall marry, we shall never part again, and we shall love,\r\nlove, love; and that is what is God.”\r\n\r\n“There, there, do not agitate yourself,” said Ursus.\r\n\r\nThe voice continued,--\r\n\r\n“Well, for instance; last year. In the spring of last year we were\r\ntogether, and we were happy. How different it is now! I forget what\r\nlittle village we were in, but there were trees, and I heard the linnets\r\nsinging. We came to London; all was changed. This is no reproach, mind.\r\nWhen one comes to a fresh place, how is one to know anything about it?\r\nFather, do you remember that one day there was a woman in the great box;\r\nyou said: ‘It is a duchess.’ I felt sad. I think it might have been\r\nbetter had we kept to the little towns. Gwynplaine has done right,\r\nwithal. Now my turn has come. Besides, you have told me yourself, that\r\nwhen I was very little, my mother died, and that I was lying on the\r\nground with the snow falling upon me, and that he, who was also very\r\nlittle then, and alone, like myself, picked me up, and that it was thus\r\nthat I came to be alive; so you cannot wonder that now I should feel it\r\nabsolutely necessary to go and search the grave to see if Gwynplaine be\r\nin it. Because the only thing which exists in life is the heart; and\r\nafter life, the soul. You take notice of what I say, father, do you not?\r\nWhat is moving? It seems as if we are in something that is moving, yet I\r\ndo not hear the sound of the wheels.”\r\n\r\nAfter a pause the voice added,--\r\n\r\n“I cannot exactly make out the difference between yesterday and to-day.\r\nI do not complain. I do not know what has occurred, but something must\r\nhave happened.”\r\n\r\nThese words, uttered with deep and inconsolable sweetness, and with a\r\nsigh which Gwynplaine heard, wound up thus,--\r\n\r\n“I must go, unless he should return.”\r\n\r\nUrsus muttered gloomily: “I do not believe in ghosts.”\r\n\r\nHe went on,--\r\n\r\n“This is a ship. You ask why the house moves; it is because we are on\r\nboard a vessel. Be calm; you must not talk so much. Daughter, if you\r\nhave any love for me, do not agitate yourself, it will make you\r\nfeverish. I am so old, I could not bear it if you were to have an\r\nillness. Spare me! do not be ill!”\r\n\r\nAgain the voice spoke,--\r\n\r\n“What is the use of searching the earth, when we can only find in\r\nheaven?”\r\n\r\nUrsus replied, with a half attempt at authority,--\r\n\r\n“Be calm. There are times when you have no sense at all. I order you to\r\nrest. After all, you cannot be expected to know what it is to rupture a\r\nblood-vessel. I should be easy if you were easy. My child, do something\r\nfor me as well. If he picked you up, I took you in. You will make me\r\nill. That is wrong. You must calm yourself, and go to sleep. All will\r\ncome right. I give you my word of honour, all will come right. Besides,\r\nit is very fine weather. The night might have been made on purpose.\r\nTo-morrow we shall be at Rotterdam, which is a city in Holland, at the\r\nmouth of the Meuse.”\r\n\r\n“Father,” said the voice, “look here; when two beings have always been\r\ntogether from infancy, their state should not be disturbed, or death\r\nmust come, and it cannot be otherwise. I love you all the same, but I\r\nfeel that I am no longer altogether with you, although I am as yet not\r\naltogether with him.”\r\n\r\n“Come! try to sleep,” repeated Ursus.\r\n\r\nThe voice answered,--\r\n\r\n“I shall have sleep enough soon.”\r\n\r\nUrsus replied, in trembling tones,--\r\n\r\n“I tell you that we are going to Holland, to Rotterdam, which is a\r\ncity.”\r\n\r\n“Father,” continued the voice, “I am not ill; if you are anxious about\r\nthat, you may rest easy. I have no fever. I am rather hot; it is nothing\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\nUrsus stammered out,--\r\n\r\n“At the mouth of the Meuse--”\r\n\r\n“I am quite well, father; but look here! I feel that I am going to die!”\r\n\r\n“Do nothing so foolish,” said Ursus. And he added, “Above all, God\r\nforbid she should have a shock!”\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Suddenly Ursus cried out,--\r\n\r\n“What are you doing? Why are you getting up? Lie down again, I implore\r\nof you.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine shivered, and stretched out his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPARADISE REGAINED BELOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe saw Dea. She had just raised herself up on the mattress. She had on a\r\nlong white dress, carefully closed, and showing only the delicate form\r\nof her neck. The sleeves covered her arms; the folds, her feet. The\r\nbranch-like tracery of blue veins, hot and swollen with fever, were\r\nvisible on her hands. She was shivering and rocking, rather than\r\nreeling, to and fro, like a reed. The lantern threw up its glancing\r\nlight on her beautiful face. Her loosened hair floated over her\r\nshoulders. No tears fell on her cheeks. In her eyes there was fire, and\r\ndarkness. She was pale, with that paleness which is like the\r\ntransparency of a divine life in an earthly face. Her fragile and\r\nexquisite form was, as it were, blended and interfused with the folds of\r\nher robe. She wavered like the flicker of a flame, while, at the same\r\ntime, she was dwindling into shadow. Her eyes, opened wide, were\r\nresplendent. She was as one just freed from the sepulchre; a soul\r\nstanding in the dawn.\r\n\r\nUrsus, whose back only was visible to Gwynplaine, raised his arms in\r\nterror. “O my child! O heavens! she is delirious. Delirium is what I\r\nfeared worst of all. She must have no shock, for that might kill her;\r\nyet nothing but a shock can prevent her going mad. Dead or mad! what a\r\nsituation. O God! what can I do? My child, lie down again.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Dea spoke. Her voice was almost indistinct, as if a cloud\r\nalready interposed between her and earth.\r\n\r\n“Father, you are wrong. I am not in the least delirious. I hear all you\r\nsay to me, distinctly. You tell me that there is a great crowd of\r\npeople, that they are waiting, and that I must play to-night. I am quite\r\nwilling. You see that I have my reason; but I do not know what to do,\r\nsince I am dead, and Gwynplaine is dead. I am coming all the same. I am\r\nready to play. Here I am; but Gwynplaine is no longer here.”\r\n\r\n“Come, my child,” said Ursus, “do as I bid you. Lie down again.”\r\n\r\n“He is no longer here, no longer here. Oh! how dark it is!”\r\n\r\n“Dark!” muttered Ursus. “This is the first time she has ever uttered\r\nthat word!”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, with as little noise as he could help making as he crept,\r\nmounted the step of the caravan, entered it, took from the nail the cape\r\nand the esclavine, put the esclavine round his neck, and redescended\r\nfrom the van, still concealed by the projection of the cabin, the\r\nrigging, and the mast.\r\n\r\nDea continued murmuring. She moved her lips, and by degrees the murmur\r\nbecame a melody. In broken pauses, and with the interrupted cadences of\r\ndelirium, her voice broke into the mysterious appeal she had so often\r\naddressed to Gwynplaine in _Chaos Vanquished_. She sang, and her voice\r\nwas low and uncertain as the murmur of the bee,--\r\n\r\n  “Noche, quita te de allí.\r\n  El alba canta....”[23]\r\n\r\nShe stopped. “No, it is not true. I am not dead. What was I saying?\r\nAlas! I am alive. I am alive. He is dead. I am below. He is above. He is\r\ngone. I remain. I shall hear his voice no more, nor his footstep. God,\r\nwho had given us a little Paradise on earth, has taken it away.\r\nGwynplaine, it is over. I shall never feel you near me again. Never! And\r\nhis voice! I shall never hear his voice again. And she sang:--\r\n\r\n  “Es menester a cielos ir--\r\n  Deja, quiero,\r\n  A tu negro\r\n  Caparazon.”\r\n\r\n  “We must go to heaven.\r\n  Take off, I entreat thee,\r\n  Thy black cloak.”\r\n\r\nShe stretched out her hand, as if she sought something in space on which\r\nshe might rest.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine, rising by the side of Ursus, who had suddenly become as\r\nthough petrified, knelt down before her.\r\n\r\n“Never,” said Dea, “never shall I hear him again.”\r\n\r\nShe began, wandering, to sing again:--\r\n\r\n  “Deja, quiero,\r\n  A tu negro\r\n  Caparazon.”\r\n\r\nThen she heard a voice--even the beloved voice--answering:--\r\n\r\n  “O ven! ama!\r\n  Eres alma,\r\n  Soy corazon.”\r\n\r\n  “O come and love\r\n  Thou art the soul,\r\n  I am the heart.”\r\n\r\nAnd at the same instant Dea felt under her hand the head of Gwynplaine.\r\nShe uttered an indescribable cry.\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine!”\r\n\r\nA light, as of a star, shone over her pale face, and she tottered.\r\nGwynplaine received her in his arms.\r\n\r\n“Alive!” cried Ursus.\r\n\r\nDea repeated “Gwynplaine;” and with her head bowed against Gwynplaine’s\r\ncheek, she whispered faintly,--\r\n\r\n“You have come down to me again. I thank you, Gwynplaine.”\r\n\r\nAnd seated on his knee, she lifted up her head. Wrapt in his embrace,\r\nshe turned her sweet face towards him, and fixed on him those eyes so\r\nfull of light and shadow, as though she could see him.\r\n\r\n“It is you,” she said.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine covered her sobs with kisses. There are words which are at\r\nonce words, cries, and sobs, in which all ecstasy and all grief are\r\nmingled and burst forth together. They have no meaning, and yet tell\r\nall.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is! It is I, Gwynplaine, of whom you are the soul. Do you hear\r\nme? I, of whom you are the child, the wife, the star, the breath of\r\nlife; I, to whom you are eternity. It is I. I am here. I hold you in my\r\narms. I am alive. I am yours. Oh, when I think that in a moment all\r\nwould have been over--one minute more, but for Homo! I will tell you\r\neverything. How near is despair to joy! Dea, we live! Dea, forgive me.\r\nYes--yours for ever. You are right. Touch my forehead. Make sure that it\r\nis I. If you only knew--but nothing can separate us now. I rise out of\r\nhell, and ascend into heaven. Am I not with you? You said that I\r\ndescended. Not so; I reascend. Once more with you! For ever! I tell you\r\nfor ever! Together! We are together! Who would have believed it? We have\r\nfound each other again. All our troubles are past. Before us now there\r\nis nothing but enchantment. We will renew our happy life, and we will\r\nshut the door so fast that misfortune shall never enter again. I will\r\ntell you all. You will be astonished. The vessel has sailed. No one can\r\nprevent that now. We are on our voyage, and at liberty. We are going to\r\nHolland. We will marry. I have no fear about gaining a livelihood. What\r\ncan hinder it? There is nothing to fear. I adore you!”\r\n\r\n“Not so quick!” stammered Ursus.\r\n\r\nDea, trembling, and with the rapture of an angelic touch, passed her\r\nhand over Gwynplaine’s profile. He overheard her say to herself, “It is\r\nthus that gods are made.”\r\n\r\nThen she touched his clothes.\r\n\r\n“The esclavine,” she said, “the cape. Nothing changed; all as it was\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\nUrsus, stupefied, delighted, smiling, drowned in tears, looked at them,\r\nand addressed an aside to himself.\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand it in the least. I am a stupid idiot--I, who saw him\r\ncarried to the grave! I cry and I laugh. That is all I know. I am as\r\ngreat a fool as if I were in love myself. But that is just what I am. I\r\nam in love with them both. Old fool! Too much emotion--too much emotion.\r\nIt is what I was afraid of. No; it is that I wished for. Gwynplaine, be\r\ncareful of her. Yes, let them kiss; it is no affair of mine. I am but a\r\nspectator. What I feel is droll. I am the parasite of their happiness,\r\nand I am nourished by it.”\r\n\r\nWhilst Ursus was talking to himself, Gwynplaine exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“Dea, you are too beautiful! I don’t know where my wits were gone these\r\nlast few days. Truly, there is but you on earth. I see you again, but as\r\nyet I can hardly believe it. In this ship! But tell me, how did it all\r\nhappen? To what a state have they reduced you! But where is the Green\r\nBox? They have robbed you. They have driven you away. It is infamous.\r\nOh, I will avenge you--I will avenge you, Dea! They shall answer for it.\r\nI am a peer of England.”\r\n\r\nUrsus, as if stricken by a planet full in his breast, drew back, and\r\nlooked at Gwynplaine attentively.\r\n\r\n“It is clear that he is not dead; but can he have gone mad?” and he\r\nlistened to him doubtfully.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine resumed.\r\n\r\n“Be easy, Dea; I will carry my complaint to the House of Lords.”\r\n\r\nUrsus looked at him again, and struck his forehead with the tip of his\r\nforefinger. Then making up his mind,--\r\n\r\n“It is all one to me,” he said. “It will be all right, all the same. Be\r\nas mad as you like, my Gwynplaine. It is one of the rights of man. As\r\nfor me, I am happy. But how came all this about?”\r\n\r\nThe vessel continued to sail smoothly and fast. The night grew darker\r\nand darker. The mists, which came inland from the ocean, were invading\r\nthe zenith, from which no wind blew them away. Only a few large stars\r\nwere visible, and they disappeared one after another, so that soon there\r\nwere none at all, and the whole sky was dark, infinite, and soft. The\r\nriver broadened until the banks on each side were nothing but two thin\r\nbrown lines mingling with the gloom. Out of all this shadow rose a\r\nprofound peace. Gwynplaine, half seated, held Dea in his embrace. They\r\nspoke, they cried, they babbled, they murmured in a mad dialogue of joy!\r\nHow are we to paint thee, O joy!\r\n\r\n“My life!”\r\n\r\n“My heaven!”\r\n\r\n“My love!”\r\n\r\n“My whole happiness!”\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine!”\r\n\r\n“Dea, I am drunk. Let me kiss your feet.”\r\n\r\n“Is it you, then, for certain?”\r\n\r\n“I have so much to say to you now that I do not know where to begin.”\r\n\r\n“One kiss!”\r\n\r\n“O my wife!”\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine, do not tell me that I am beautiful. It is you who are\r\nhandsome.”\r\n\r\n“I have found you again. I hold you to my heart. This is true. You are\r\nmine. I do not dream. Is it possible? Yes, it is. I recover possession\r\nof life. If you only knew! I have met with all sorts of adventures.\r\nDea!”\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine, I love you!”\r\n\r\nAnd Ursus murmured,--\r\n\r\n“Mine is the joy of a grandfather.”\r\n\r\nHomo, having come from under the van, was going from one to the other\r\ndiscreetly, exacting no attention, licking them left and right--now\r\nUrsus’s thick shoes, now Gwynplaine’s cape, now Dea’s dress, now the\r\nmattress. This was his way of giving his blessing.\r\n\r\nThey had passed Chatham and the mouth of the Medway. They were\r\napproaching the sea. The shadowy serenity of the atmosphere was such\r\nthat the passage down the Thames was being made without trouble: no\r\nmanoeuvre was needful, nor was any sailor called on deck. At the other\r\nend of the vessel the skipper, still alone, was steering. There was\r\nonly this man aft. At the bow the lantern lighted up the happy group of\r\nbeings who, from the depths of misery, had suddenly been raised to\r\nhappiness by a meeting so unhoped for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nNAY; ON HIGH!\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly Dea, disengaging herself from Gwynplaine’s embrace, arose. She\r\npressed both her hands against her heart, as if to still its throbbings.\r\n\r\n“What is wrong with me?” said she. “There is something the matter. Joy\r\nis suffocating. No, it is nothing! That is lucky. Your reappearance, O\r\nmy Gwynplaine, has given me a blow--a blow of happiness. All this heaven\r\nof joy which you have put into my heart has intoxicated me. You being\r\nabsent, I felt myself dying. The true life which was leaving me you have\r\nbrought back. I felt as if something was being torn away within me. It\r\nis the shadows that have been torn away, and I feel life dawn in my\r\nbrain--a glowing life, a life of fever and delight. This life which you\r\nhave just given me is wonderful. It is so heavenly that it makes me\r\nsuffer somewhat. It seems as though my soul is enlarged, and can\r\nscarcely be contained in my body. This life of seraphim, this plenitude,\r\nflows into my brain and penetrates it. I feel like a beating of wings\r\nwithin my breast. I feel strangely, but happy. Gwynplaine, you have been\r\nmy resurrection.”\r\n\r\nShe flushed, became pale, then flushed again, and fell.\r\n\r\n“Alas!” said Ursus, “you have killed her.”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine stretched his arms towards Dea. Extremity of anguish coming\r\nupon extremity of ecstasy, what a shock! He would himself have fallen,\r\nhad he not had to support her.\r\n\r\n“Dea!” he cried, shuddering, “what is the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” said she--“I love you!”\r\n\r\nShe lay in his arms, lifeless, like a piece of linen; her hands were\r\nhanging down helplessly.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine and Ursus placed Dea on the mattress. She said, feebly,--\r\n\r\n“I cannot breathe lying down.”\r\n\r\nThey lifted her up.\r\n\r\nUrsus said,--\r\n\r\n“Fetch a pillow.”\r\n\r\nShe replied,--\r\n\r\n“What for? I have Gwynplaine!”\r\n\r\nShe laid her head on Gwynplaine’s shoulder, who was sitting behind, and\r\nsupporting her, his eyes wild with grief.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said she, “how happy I am!”\r\n\r\nUrsus took her wrist, and counted the pulsation of the artery. He did\r\nnot shake his head. He said nothing, nor expressed his thought except by\r\nthe rapid movement of his eyelids, which were opening and closing\r\nconvulsively, as if to prevent a flood of tears from bursting out.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” asked Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\nUrsus placed his ear against Dea’s left side.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine repeated his question eagerly, fearful of the answer.\r\n\r\nUrsus looked at Gwynplaine, then at Dea. He was livid. He said,--\r\n\r\n“We ought to be parallel with Canterbury. The distance from here to\r\nGravesend cannot be very great. We shall have fine weather all night. We\r\nneed fear no attack at sea, because the fleets are all on the coast of\r\nSpain. We shall have a good passage.”\r\n\r\nDea, bent, and growing paler and paler, clutched her robe convulsively.\r\nShe heaved a sigh of inexpressible sadness, and murmured,--\r\n\r\n“I know what this is. I am dying!”\r\n\r\nGwynplaine rose in terror. Ursus held Dea.\r\n\r\n“Die! You die! No; it shall not be! You cannot die! Die now! Die at\r\nonce! It is impossible! God is not ferociously cruel--to give you and to\r\ntake you back in the same moment. No; such a thing cannot be. It would\r\nmake one doubt in Him. Then, indeed, would everything be a snare--the\r\nearth, the sky, the cradles of infants, the human heart, love, the\r\nstars. God would be a traitor and man a dupe. There would be nothing in\r\nwhich to believe. It would be an insult to the creation. Everything\r\nwould be an abyss. You know not what you say, Dea. You shall live! I\r\ncommand you to live! You must obey me! I am your husband and your\r\nmaster; I forbid you to leave me! O heavens! O wretched Man! No, it\r\ncannot be--I to remain in the world after you! Why, it is as monstrous\r\nas that there should be no sun! Dea! Dea! recover! It is but a moment\r\nof passing pain. One feels a shudder at times, and thinks no more about\r\nit. It is absolutely necessary that you should get well and cease to\r\nsuffer. _You_ die! What have I done to you? The very thought of it\r\ndrives me mad. We belong to each other, and we love each other. You have\r\nno reason for going! It would be unjust! Have I committed crimes?\r\nBesides, you have forgiven me. Oh, you would not make me desperate--have\r\nme become a villain, a madman, drive me to perdition? Dea, I entreat\r\nyou! I conjure you! I supplicate you! Do not die!”\r\n\r\nAnd clenching his hands in his hair, agonized with fear, stifled with\r\ntears, he threw himself at her feet.\r\n\r\n“My Gwynplaine,” said Dea, “it is no fault of mine.”\r\n\r\nThere then rose to her lips a red froth, which Ursus wiped away with the\r\nfold of her robe, before Gwynplaine, who was prostrate at her feet,\r\ncould see it.\r\n\r\nGwynplaine took her feet in his hands, and implored her in all kinds of\r\nconfused words.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, I will not have it! _You_ die? I have no strength left to\r\nbear it. Die? Yes; but both of us together--not otherwise. _You_ die, my\r\nDea? I will never consent to it! My divinity, my love! Do you understand\r\nthat I am with you? I swear that you shall live! Oh, but you cannot have\r\nthought what would become of me after you were gone. If you had an idea\r\nof the necessity which you are to me, you would see that it is\r\nabsolutely impossible! Dea! you see I have but you! The most\r\nextraordinary things have happened to me. You will hardly believe that I\r\nhave just explored the whole of life in a few hours! I have found out\r\none thing--that there is nothing in it! You exist! if you did not, the\r\nuniverse would have no meaning. Stay with me! Have pity on me! Since you\r\nlove me, live on! If I have just found you again, it is to keep you.\r\nWait a little longer; you cannot leave me like this, now that we have\r\nbeen together but a few minutes! Do not be impatient! O Heaven, how I\r\nsuffer! You are not angry with me, are you? You know that I could not\r\nhelp going when the wapentake came for me. You will breathe more easily\r\npresently, you will see. Dea, all has been put right. We are going to be\r\nhappy. Do not drive me to despair, Dea! I have done nothing to you.”\r\n\r\nThese words were not spoken, but sobbed out. They rose from his\r\nbreast--now in a lament which might have attracted the dove, now in a\r\nroar which might have made lions recoil.\r\n\r\nDea answered him in a voice growing weaker and weaker, and pausing at\r\nnearly every word.\r\n\r\n“Alas! it is of no use, my beloved. I see that you are doing all you\r\ncan. An hour ago I wanted to die; now I do not. Gwynplaine--my adored\r\nGwynplaine--how happy we have been! God placed you in my life, and He\r\ntakes me out of yours. You see, I am going. You will remember the Green\r\nBox, won’t you, and poor blind little Dea? You will remember my song? Do\r\nnot forget the sound of my voice, and the way in which I said, ‘I love\r\nyou!’ I will come back and tell it to you again, in the night while you\r\nare asleep. Yes, we found each other again; but it was too much joy. It\r\nwas to end at once. It is decreed that I am to go first. I love my\r\nfather, Ursus, and my brother, Homo, very dearly. You are all so good.\r\nThere is no air here. Open the window. My Gwynplaine, I did not tell\r\nyou, but I was jealous of a woman who came one day. You do not even know\r\nof whom I speak. Is it not so? Cover my arms; I am rather cold. And Fibi\r\nand Vinos, where are they? One comes to love everybody. One feels a\r\nfriendship for all those who have been mixed up in one’s happiness. We\r\nhave a kindly feeling towards them for having been present in our joys.\r\nWhy has it all passed away? I have not clearly understood what has\r\nhappened during the last two days. Now I am dying. Leave me in my dress.\r\nWhen I put it on I foresaw that it would be my shroud. I wish to keep it\r\non. Gwynplaine’s kisses are upon it. Oh, what would I not have given to\r\nhave lived on! What a happy life we led in our poor caravan! How we\r\nsang! How I listened to the applause! What joy it was never to be\r\nseparated from each other! It seemed to me that I was living in a cloud\r\nwith you; I knew one day from another, although I was blind. I knew that\r\nit was morning, because I heard Gwynplaine; I felt that it was night,\r\nbecause I dreamed of Gwynplaine. I felt that I was wrapped up in\r\nsomething which was his soul. We adored each other so sweetly. It is all\r\nfading away; and there will be no more songs. Alas that I cannot live\r\non! You will think of me, my beloved!”\r\n\r\nHer voice was growing fainter. The ominous waning, which was death, was\r\nstealing away her breath. She folded her thumbs within her fingers--a\r\nsign that her last moments were approaching. It seemed as though the\r\nfirst uncertain words of an angel just created were blended with the\r\nlast failing accents of the dying girl.\r\n\r\nShe murmured,--\r\n\r\n“You will think of me, won’t you? It would be very sad to be dead, and\r\nto be remembered by no one. I have been wayward at times; I beg pardon\r\nof you all. I am sure that, if God had so willed it, we might yet have\r\nbeen happy, my Gwynplaine; for we take up but very little room, and we\r\nmight have earned our bread together in another land. But God has willed\r\nit otherwise. I cannot make out in the least why I am dying. I never\r\ncomplained of being blind, so that I cannot have offended any one. I\r\nshould never have asked for anything, but always to be blind as I was,\r\nby your side. Oh, how sad it is to have to part!”\r\n\r\nHer words were more and more inarticulate, evaporating into each other,\r\nas if they were being blown away. She had become almost inaudible.\r\n\r\n“Gwynplaine,” she resumed, “you will think of me, won’t you? I shall\r\ncrave it when I am dead.”\r\n\r\nAnd she added,--\r\n\r\n“Oh, keep me with you!”\r\n\r\nThen, after a pause, she said,--\r\n\r\n“Come to me as soon as you can. I shall be very unhappy without you,\r\neven in heaven. Do not leave me long alone, my sweet Gwynplaine! My\r\nparadise was here; above there is only heaven! Oh! I cannot breathe! My\r\nbeloved! My beloved! My beloved!”\r\n\r\n“Mercy!” cried Gwynplaine.\r\n\r\n“Farewell!” murmured Dea.\r\n\r\nAnd he pressed his mouth to her beautiful icy hands. For a moment it\r\nseemed as if she had ceased to breathe. Then she raised herself on her\r\nelbows, and an intense splendour flashed across her eyes, and through an\r\nineffable smile her voice rang out clearly.\r\n\r\n“Light!” she cried. “I see!”\r\n\r\nAnd she expired. She fell back rigid and motionless on the mattress.\r\n\r\n“Dead!” said Ursus.\r\n\r\nAnd the poor old man, as if crushed by his despair, bowed his bald head\r\nand buried his swollen face in the folds of the gown which covered Dea’s\r\nfeet. He lay there in a swoon.\r\n\r\nThen Gwynplaine became awful. He arose, lifted his eyes, and gazed into\r\nthe vast gloom above him. Seen by none on earth, but looked down upon,\r\nperhaps, as he stood in the darkness, by some invisible presence, he\r\nstretched his hands on high, and said,--\r\n\r\n“I come!”\r\n\r\nAnd he strode across the deck, towards the side of the vessel, as if\r\nbeckoned by a vision.\r\n\r\nA few paces off was the abyss. He walked slowly, never casting down his\r\neyes. A smile came upon his face, such as Dea’s had just worn. He\r\nadvanced straight before him, as if watching something. In his eyes was\r\na light like the reflection of a soul perceived from afar off. He cried\r\nout, “Yes!” At every step he was approaching nearer to the side of the\r\nvessel. His gait was rigid, his arms were lifted up, his head was thrown\r\nback, his eyeballs were fixed. His movement was ghost-like. He advanced\r\nwithout haste and without hesitation, with fatal precision, as though\r\nthere were before him no yawning gulf and open grave. He murmured, “Be\r\neasy. I follow you. I understand the sign that you are making me.” His\r\neyes were fixed upon a certain spot in the sky, where the shadow was\r\ndeepest. The smile was still upon his face. The sky was perfectly black;\r\nthere was no star visible in it, and yet he evidently saw one. He\r\ncrossed the deck. A few stiff and ominous steps, and he had reached the\r\nvery edge.\r\n\r\n“I come,” said he; “Dea, behold, I come!”\r\n\r\nOne step more; there was no bulwark; the void was before him; he strode\r\ninto it. He fell. The night was thick and dull, the water deep. It\r\nswallowed him up. He disappeared calmly and silently. None saw nor heard\r\nhim. The ship sailed on, and the river flowed.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards the ship reached the sea.\r\n\r\nWhen Ursus returned to consciousness, he found that Gwynplaine was no\r\nlonger with him, and he saw Homo by the edge of the deck baying in the\r\nshadow and looking down upon the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: As much as to say, the other daughters are provided for as\r\nbest may be.

It turns upon the fact that in the French\r\nlanguage the word for darkness is plural--_ténèbres_.--TRANSLATOR.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Transcriber’s note: The original text refers to “vitres\r\népaisses”, thick panes, without specific dimensions.
