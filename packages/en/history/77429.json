Henry’s daughter, Maud, had\r\nbeen married to Henry V., Emperor of Germany, in 1114; it was clearly\r\nimpossible for England and Normandy to be ruled in conjunction with the\r\nEmpire, and Maud had no children to whom her father’s crown might pass.\r\nThe king’s unruly brother, Robert of Normandy, was still alive, but a\r\nprisoner in England; and his son William, the most formidable candidate\r\nfor the throne, was destined to die in Flanders in 1128. But before\r\ndeath had removed this dangerous and unpopular competitor, a fresh\r\nsolution of the difficulty had become possible. Maud’s husband, the\r\nemperor, had died in 1125,[1] and on 1st January 1127, King Henry\r\ndeclared Maud his heir, and caused the peers to swear to accept her as\r\nhis successor in England and in Normandy. There was no precedent for\r\nfemale sovereignty in either country, and it was probably not\r\nanticipated that she should reign alone, but rather that she should by\r\nmarriage bestow the crown upon some fitting partner. The important\r\nmatter of this marriage Henry had virtually undertaken to submit to the\r\ndecision of his barons, but at the end of May 1127 he betrothed her,\r\nwith an absence of preparation that amounted almost to secrecy, to\r\nGeoffrey, son of Count Fulk of Anjou, a boy of fourteen, eleven years\r\nthe junior of his bride. The marriage, as Henry had foreseen, was\r\nunpopular, though the addition of the neighbouring provinces of Anjou\r\nand Maine to Normandy made the King of England the most powerful of all\r\nthe feudatories of France.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Geoffrey, now Count of Anjou, and Maud took place in\r\nJune 1129, but within a few weeks the quick-tempered count and his\r\nhaughty bride had quarrelled and separated, and it was not until the\r\nautumn of 1131 that they came together again. Their reunion was made by\r\nHenry the occasion for causing his barons to renew their oath of\r\nallegiance to Maud as his successor, thereby quashing any objection that\r\nmight have been made to the previous oath as invalidated by her\r\nmarriage. The king was now more than sixty years old, and his anxiety\r\nfor the future of his country and his dynasty must have been greatly\r\nrelieved by the birth of a son to Geoffrey and Maud on the 25th March\r\n1133. The boy was called Henry, after his grandfather, and it is\r\nsignificant of the predominance attaching to his mother, as heiress of\r\nEngland and Normandy, that the title by which he was most commonly known\r\nto his contemporaries was that of Henry Fitz-Empress.\r\n\r\nThe death of Henry I., on 1st December 1135, seems to have taken the\r\nempress and her partisans by surprise. She went almost at once into\r\nNormandy to press her claims, half-heartedly and with little success;\r\nbut in the meanwhile her cousin, Stephen of Blois, nephew of the late\r\nking, had crossed into England, and, with the assistance of his brother,\r\nHenry, Bishop of Winchester, had caused himself to be crowned king on\r\n22nd December. The Norman barons accepted Stephen, and the final blow\r\nwas given to Maud’s cause by the Pope’s declaration in favour of her\r\nrival. Her half-brother, however, Earl Robert of Gloucester, was not\r\nlong in forming a party to support the claims of Maud and her son in\r\nEngland, and in 1139 Maud herself crossed the Channel with a small body\r\nof troops. With the varying fortunes of the long-continued war between\r\nthe empress and Stephen we are not concerned, but it was when Maud’s\r\ncause was almost at its worst, in the winter of 1142, that her young son\r\nHenry, then in his tenth year, came over in charge of his uncle, Earl\r\nRobert, and was settled at Bristol. There he remained for four years\r\nunder the tuition of a certain Master Matthew, who cultivated in him\r\nthat love for learning which made him in later days the most literary\r\nprince of his time and a worthy successor of his scholarly grandfather.\r\n\r\nDuring those four years Henry’s father, Geoffrey of Anjou, had been\r\nstrengthening his position on the Continent, though apparently making no\r\neffort to assist his wife in her struggle with Stephen. By the end of\r\n1143 he had secured control of the greater part of Normandy, and early\r\nin 1144 Rouen surrendered and Geoffrey was recognised as Duke of\r\nNormandy. Having established himself securely he now sent for his son to\r\njoin him, and accordingly, late in 1146, or at the beginning of the next\r\nyear, Earl Robert of Gloucester escorted young Henry to Wareham and\r\nthere bade farewell to him. Uncle and nephew were destined to meet no\r\nmore, for on 31st October 1147 Earl Robert died. Immediately the earl’s\r\ndeath was known, Earl Gilbert of Pembroke, whose castle of Pevensey was\r\nthen undergoing a siege, urged Henry’s return. He considered that the\r\nonly hope for the empress’s cause, now that its mainstay had departed,\r\nlay in the presence of Henry in England. The boy--he was only\r\nfourteen--hurriedly crossed with a few companions, landed at one of the\r\nwestern ports, and made feeble attacks on Cricklade and Bourton, in\r\nGloucestershire, from which he was easily driven off. His forces\r\ndwindled rather than increased, and his scanty supply of money soon came\r\nto an end. An application to his mother for further funds proved\r\nineffectual, as she was in the same straits herself. He then turned to\r\nthe Earl of Gloucester for assistance; but Earl William was very\r\ndifferent from his father; he cared little for war, had no enthusiasm\r\nfor the cause of his cousin, and saw no reason why he should waste his\r\ntreasure on a desperate and hopeless enterprise. Unable for lack of\r\nfunds either to continue his injudicious venture or to leave the\r\ncountry, the humiliated prince had to apply for help to the rival whom\r\nhe had so rashly attacked. Stephen, always chivalrous and good-natured\r\neven to weakness, in spite of the opposition and remonstrances of his\r\nadvisers, at once supplied Henry with the necessary means of returning\r\nto his father’s court, where, in the early spring of 1148, he was joined\r\nby his mother, the empress.[2]\r\n\r\nGeoffrey, now that he was firmly established in Normandy, seems to have\r\nbegun to plan the aggrandisement of his son, in whose right he had\r\nobtained the duchy. And so, in April 1149, Henry was sent to England to\r\nreceive the honour of knighthood from King David of Scotland, his\r\nmother’s uncle. Landing, probably, at Wareham, he made a brief stay at\r\nDevizes, where we find in his company Roger, Earl of Hereford, Patrick,\r\nEarl of Salisbury, William Beauchamp, John St. John, Roger Berkeley,\r\nHubert de Vaux, Henry Hussey, Manser Bisset and others.[3] Thence he\r\npassed peacefully northwards, the whole of western England being in the\r\nhands of magnates, such as the Earls of Leicester and Warwick, who were\r\nfriendly to his cause or at least hostile to that of Stephen. To\r\nCarlisle he was brought by Earl Ralph of Chester, and there he was\r\nreceived by King David and his son Henry, Earl of Northumberland, and on\r\nWhitsunday, 22nd May, was duly invested with the insignia of knighthood.\r\nHenry and his ally of Scotland now persuaded the powerful Earl of\r\nChester to join forces with them against Stephen, but before this scheme\r\ncould be carried out King Stephen had outbid his rivals and bought the\r\nsupport of the earl by a bestowal of fiefs so lavish as to render him\r\nalmost king of northern England.\r\n\r\nReturning to his father in January 1150, Henry was invested with the\r\ndukedom of Normandy. But a little more than a year later Stephen’s son,\r\nEustace, persuaded King Louis of France, with whom Geoffrey\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (1)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (2)\r\n\r\nSEALS OF HENRY AS DUKE OF NORMANDY (3/4)]\r\n\r\nhad quarrelled, to assist him in regaining Normandy. The allies advanced\r\nas far as Arques, where they were opposed by the forces under the young\r\nduke. Henry here exhibited that scrupulous respect for his feudal\r\noverlord, the King of France, which he displayed so conspicuously in\r\nlater years, and acted on the defensive, refusing to attack his\r\nsuzerain. Eustace was a man of warlike spirit, but King Louis, who,\r\nthough not averse to war, seems to have had a profound distaste for\r\nfighting, did not care to risk a battle and retired for the time. Later\r\nin the year he despatched another force to operate against Mantes, but\r\nGeoffrey now came to terms and agreed to surrender the Vexin, the\r\nborderland between France and Normandy, on condition that Louis should\r\nconfirm Henry in the possession of the rest of the Norman duchy, and\r\nthese terms the French king gladly accepted.\r\n\r\nHenry had now established his claim to half of his grandfather’s\r\ndominions, and began to plan the recovery of the remainder by an\r\ninvasion of England. His plans, however, were interfered with by the\r\nsudden death of his father on 7th September 1151. The recovery of\r\nEngland was postponed, but a great accession of territory was obtained\r\nby Henry in the following spring. Louis VII. had married Eleanor, the\r\nheiress of Aquitaine, in 1137, but relations between the able and\r\nenergetic queen and her feeble husband had gradually become strained to\r\nbreaking, and at last, early in 1152, they discovered that they ought\r\nnever to have married, being related to one another, distantly but\r\nwithin the degrees theoretically prohibited by the Church.[4] A divorce\r\nwas granted on 18th March, and Eleanor, avoiding the too pressing\r\nattentions of Count Theobald of Blois and Geoffrey of Anjou, Henry’s\r\nyounger brother, intimated her willingness to bestow her hand and great\r\npossessions upon the Duke of Normandy. Henry, now nineteen, but with a\r\nreputation that many an older man might have envied, hastened at once to\r\nmeet Eleanor at Poitiers, and they were married in May. By this marriage\r\nHenry became master of Aquitaine and Poitou, in addition to Anjou,\r\nMaine, and Normandy, and his rule reached from the Channel to the\r\nPyrenees.\r\n\r\nHe now once more prepared for the invasion of England, and was\r\nassembling his forces at Barfleur in June when he found himself called\r\nupon to face the combined forces of Eleanor’s late husband, King Louis,\r\nand her disappointed suitors, Count Theobald and Geoffrey of Anjou.\r\nHenry displayed the energy and rapidity of movement which in later years\r\nmade the French king declare that he must be able to fly, dashed down to\r\nPacey and prepared to attack the French forces, but Louis, with his\r\nusual discretion, retired at once. Henry promptly turned north to crush\r\nthe rebellious Richer of L’Aigle and destroy his robbers’ castle of\r\nBonmoulins. The Norman frontier had been secured before the end of\r\nAugust, and the duke was free to turn his hand against his brother\r\nGeoffrey, which he did very effectually, reducing Montsoreau and\r\ncompelling Geoffrey to sue for peace. A truce patched up between Henry\r\nand Louis was speedily renounced by the latter, but Henry, estimating\r\nhis adversary’s military abilities at a low rate, continued his\r\npreparations for the invasion of England, and eventually crossed about\r\nthe second week in January 1153, with a fleet of thirty-six ships.\r\n\r\nIt was probably at Wareham that Henry landed with his hundred and forty\r\nmen-at-arms and three thousand infantry, and he would seem to have gone\r\nstraight to Bristol, where he was joined by those magnates who had\r\nsupported his cause in the past, or who considered that it would be to\r\ntheir advantage to do so in the future. Operations were at once begun\r\nagainst Malmesbury Castle, and the outer works were speedily carried,\r\nbut the massive keep was too strong to be stormed and could only be\r\nreduced by starvation. Meanwhile Stephen had collected his forces and\r\nwas marching to the rescue; after halting for the night at Cirencester\r\nhe advanced to the relief of Malmesbury, but found the little Avon\r\nswollen and impassable, while a bitter wind and blinding rain and sleet,\r\ndriving in the faces of his men, made it impossible for him to advance\r\nor to retain his position. Abandoning his enterprise, the king marched\r\nback to London, and the castellan Jordan had no choice but to\r\nsurrender. Enheartened by the capture of Malmesbury, Henry now directed\r\nhis energies to the particular business which had brought him over--the\r\nrelief of Wallingford. During the past five or six years, although the\r\ncountry as a whole had been at peace, some of the more restless spirits\r\nhad carried on a sort of war on their own account, and of these one of\r\nthe most prominent had been Brian Fitz-Count of Wallingford. In 1152 he\r\nhad managed to destroy the castles set up at Brightwell and Reading to\r\nkeep him in check, and Stephen had been obliged to besiege Wallingford\r\nCastle and blockade it by the erection of counter-works at Crowmarsh.\r\nFinding themselves in difficulties, the garrison had sent over to Henry\r\nfor assistance, and he now came to the rescue and invested Crowmarsh. An\r\noutlying portion of the royalist siege works on Wallingford Bridge had\r\nalready fallen into his hands, when Stephen once more offered fight.\r\nHenry, for his part, was very willing to give battle and drew out his\r\nforces, but the desire of the prelates to avoid further bloodshed, and\r\nthe fear of the barons that a decisive victory might destroy the balance\r\nof power between the two parties and so render their own services less\r\nmarketable, resulted in secret negotiations, and compelled the rivals to\r\nagree to a truce for five days, though suggestions for a more permanent\r\ncessation of hostilities, made at a private interview between Henry and\r\nStephen, came to nothing. The terms of the truce were highly favourable\r\nto Henry, the king being obliged to withdraw his garrison from\r\nCrowmarsh and allow the fortifications to be dismantled.\r\n\r\nWallingford having been relieved, and the royalists under William\r\nCheyney and Richard de Lucy having been defeated in a cavalry action\r\nnear Oxford, Henry seems to have recruited his forces in the western\r\ncounties, visiting Evesham and Warwick, where the Countess Gundreda\r\nhanded over to him the castle, from which she had ejected Stephen’s\r\ngarrison. Then, turning eastwards, he besieged and captured Stamford\r\nCastle about the same time that Stephen reduced Ipswich. The duke next\r\nplundered Nottingham, but did not attempt to take the castle. By this\r\ntime the peace party were beginning to gain the upper hand, and the\r\nefforts of Archbishop Theobald and Bishop Henry of Winchester gained\r\nstrength by the removal of their chief opponent, the king’s son, Eustace\r\nof Boulogne. That bellicose ruffian, enraged at the tame conclusion of\r\nthe Wallingford affair, had gone off on a ravaging expedition in the\r\neastern counties. After plundering Cambridgeshire he paid a similar\r\nattention to the lands of Bury St. Edmunds, rashly pillaging the\r\nmonastic lands on St. Laurence’s Day (10th August). The offended saints\r\nwere not slow to avenge the outrage, and within a week Eustace lay dead.\r\nWith his death died Stephen’s hopes of founding a dynasty, for his\r\nyounger son, William, had borne no part in the civil war and possessed\r\nneither the desire nor the ability to contest the crown with Henry.\r\n\r\nAfter some weeks of negotiation a compromise was at last arrived at by\r\nwhich Stephen was to retain the crown for life on condition of\r\nacknowledging Henry as his heir, and on 6th November 1153 this agreement\r\nwas ratified by the peers in council at Winchester; the rivals were\r\nreconciled and the barons of both parties did homage to the king and his\r\nsuccessor. From Winchester the double court moved to London, where the\r\nnews of the termination of the long and ruinous struggle was received\r\nwith the greatest enthusiasm; and after Christmas king and duke met once\r\nmore, at Oxford, on 13th January 1154, just a year since Henry had\r\nlanded in England. A little later, when they met again, at Dunstable,\r\nHenry reproached Stephen for not having fulfilled one of the conditions\r\nof the treaty of peace, which was that the castles built since the death\r\nof Henry I. should be destroyed. The task was no small one, as these\r\nso-called adulterine castles had sprung up all over the country and were\r\nestimated by Robert of Torigny, usually an accurate authority, to number\r\neleven hundred and fifteen. Stephen resented the charge of ill-faith,\r\nbut the quarrel, if it deserve the name, was soon made up, and the two\r\nprinces went down to Dover together in February to meet the Count and\r\nCountess of Flanders. While there it is said that Stephen’s Flemish\r\nmercenaries, without his knowledge but with the connivance of his son\r\nWilliam, planned to murder Henry. Whether a rumour of the plot reached\r\nhis ears or whether he considered that affairs in Normandy required his\r\npresence, Henry soon afterwards parted from the king and returned to\r\nNormandy, where he spent the next five months strengthening his\r\nposition. With King Louis he was now on good terms; and he was actually\r\nengaged in a military expedition on that king’s behalf when the throne\r\nof England fell to him by the death of Stephen on 25th October 1154.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHENRY II., KING OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry ascended the throne of England in singularly favourable\r\ncircumstances. Still young, his character had been formed and his\r\nreputation had been established on the battle-fields of England and\r\nNormandy. Far inferior to his predecessor in personal character, he was\r\nas far his superior in kingcraft, possessing just those talents\r\nnecessary for his position which the chivalrous, kindly, and erratic\r\nStephen lacked. Something of this, which was to be demonstrated by the\r\nhistory of his reign, was already obvious, and the bulk of his English\r\nsubjects were strongly prepossessed in his favour. The Church was on his\r\nside; the greater barons cared little who was king so long as their\r\ntitles and their revenues were assured to them; the lesser lords and the\r\npeasantry, exhausted and impoverished by the twenty years of anarchy,\r\nwelcomed a ruler strong enough to curb the lawless feuds of\r\nsemi-independent chieftains, while, above all, there was no other\r\nclaimant to the throne, the only possible rival, Stephen’s son, William,\r\nEarl of Warenne and Surrey, being, fortunately for himself, quite\r\nunambitious of regal honours. Possessing great powers of physical\r\nendurance, Henry was as active\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT SEAL OF HENRY AS KING\r\n\r\n(Reverse 1/1)]\r\n\r\nin mind as in body, a well-read scholar and an accomplished linguist;\r\nshort, sturdy, with coarse hands and freckled face, unkempt and careless\r\nin his dress, he overcame the disadvantages of an unattractive\r\nappearance by his courtesy and the charm of his manner, which made him\r\nformidable in diplomacy or love. Although inheriting the volcanic temper\r\nof his Angevin forefathers and liable to outbursts of diabolic rage, he\r\nruled his hot blood with a cool head, practically never allowing his\r\nfeelings to dictate his policy and but rarely indulging in acts of\r\ncruelty or revenge. He was non-religious rather than irreligious,\r\nnon-moral rather than immoral; though he made no attempt to bridle his\r\nlust, there is no reason to suppose that any of his numerous mistresses\r\nwere unwilling victims; and though his irreverence and contempt of the\r\nChurch’s sacraments shocked his contemporaries, he admired and chose for\r\nhis friends such men as St. Hugh of Lincoln. Clear-sighted and\r\nself-centred, Henry was emphatically a strong man; and it is the irony\r\nof fate that the weak spot which was to prove his ruin lay in his most\r\nunselfish and amiable trait, his affection for his family.\r\n\r\nNot the least of Henry’s qualifications for the kingship was his ability\r\nto select the right men for his ministers. It is possible that\r\nArchbishop Theobald may have had some influence in the appointment of\r\nthe brilliant young Archdeacon of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, to the high\r\noffice of Chancellor, but the king may be given the credit for choosing\r\nRobert, Earl of Leicester, and Richard of Lucy as Justiciars. All three\r\nappointments proved to have been well made, and the first two were\r\nprobably made before the coronation.[5] At this ceremony, on 19th\r\nDecember, besides the Archbishop of Canterbury, to whose see belonged\r\nthe privilege of crowning the king, there were present the Archbishops\r\nof York and of Rouen, fourteen English bishops and the bishops of\r\nBayeux, Lisieux, and Avranches, numbers of foreign noblemen, including\r\nDietrich, Count of Flanders, and a multitude of English and Norman\r\nlords. There were the king’s two brothers--Geoffrey, with whom he was\r\nshortly to be at war for the second time, and William, for whose benefit\r\nhe was no doubt already planning the conquest of Ireland; there were the\r\nroyal officers Henry of Essex, Constable of England, Richard de Humet,\r\nConstable of Normandy, Warin Fitz-Gerald, the Chamberlain, and Hugh,\r\nEarl of Norfolk, hereditary High Steward; and there amongst the\r\nbrilliant crowd would be such great lords as Reynold, Earl of Cornwall,\r\nson of King Henry I., and William, Earl of Arundel, the confirmation of\r\nwhose privileges and estates was one of the new king’s first acts.\r\nAbbots, royal chaplains, clerks of the Chancery and Exchequer, wealthy\r\nmerchants and burgesses, and the ladies of the court with their\r\nattendants, whose gay robes formed but the highest tone in an assembly\r\nblazing with colour, complete the picture. Yet of all those in whose\r\npresence Henry swore to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, to\r\nmaintain the good laws of the realm and to abate the bad, very few were\r\nEnglish and few even spoke the English tongue. The governing classes in\r\nChurch and State were Norman by lineage, language, and sympathy, and at\r\na time when an Englishman sat in St. Peter’s chair[6] scarce any of his\r\ncompatriots held offices of trust in their native country. The fusion of\r\nEnglish and Norman, which had already spread so far in the lower ranks\r\nof society, only began to affect the higher ranks in the course of the\r\nreign of Henry, who, by the ultimate failure of his life-long policy,\r\nwas to give the English nation its individuality.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the kingdom could not be neglected for coronation\r\nfestivities, and at his Christmas court, held at Bermondsey, Henry took\r\nthe first step for ensuring peace by the expulsion of the lawless\r\nFlemish mercenaries. Their leader, William of Ipres, was allowed to\r\nretain the large revenues from lands in Kent granted to him by Stephen\r\nand well earned by his loyalty and skill, and some few of his followers\r\nwere sent to join the colony of Flemings established on the borders of\r\nWales, but the bulk of the “Flemish wolves” were packed off to satisfy\r\ntheir appetite for war and plunder on the Continent. Having thus\r\ndisposed of these alien robbers, the king had next to deal with those\r\nof his own subjects who had abused their own powers and the weakness of\r\nthe central government during the anarchy to extend their possessions at\r\nthe expense of the royal demesnes and to strengthen their position by\r\nthe erection of castles. The destruction of the “adulterine” castles,\r\nerected without royal licence, had been promised, and to some extent\r\nperformed, by Stephen in the last months of his reign,[7] but Henry now\r\ndetermined to complete the work and at the same time to revoke the\r\ngrants of royal demesne whether made by King Stephen or by the empress.\r\n\r\nIn thus recovering the Crown lands the king was no doubt partly\r\ninfluenced by the desire to increase the very scanty royal revenues, and\r\npartly by his deliberate anti-feudal policy. It did not require the\r\nacute intelligence which Henry possessed to learn from the events of the\r\nlast twenty years that it would be wise to clip the wings of the great\r\nbarons, who threatened to overshadow the throne itself, and to play for\r\npopular support. It was clearly to his interest that the people should\r\nbe prosperous, contented, and loyal, and he was not slow to adopt\r\nmeasures which would render the nobles less able alike to oppose the\r\nCrown and to oppress the people. Throughout his reign he acted on these\r\nanti-feudal principles. Although Henry had a distinct appreciation of\r\njustice, it may be doubted if the legal reforms, which were in many\r\nways the most important features of his reign, would ever have seen the\r\nlight had they not tended towards the elevation of the smaller men and\r\nthe consequent depression of the greater. With a few exceptions it will\r\nbe found that when Henry required, as he usually did, to increase his\r\nrevenues by means of doubtful legality, he preferred to extort large\r\nsums from the wealthy rather than an equivalent multitude of small\r\namounts from the poorer classes. So also the frequent substitution of\r\nmoney payments for military service helped to discourage the maintenance\r\nof large bands of armed retainers, kept nominally for the king’s service\r\nbut liable to be used for the furthering of their lord’s ambition. Yet\r\nin all cases Henry acted with a wise moderation, which, leaving the\r\ngreat lords in possession of their titles and estates, left them in the\r\nposition of having more to lose than gain by rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe king’s orders were as a whole acquiesced in with little resistance,\r\nthe estates wrested from the Crown were restored, the castles\r\ndemolished, life and property were once more secure, commerce revived,\r\nthe merchants came forth to find customers and the Jews to seek their\r\ndebtors. But William of Aumâle, Earl of Yorkshire, who, under Stephen,\r\nhad enjoyed a semi-regal independence, hesitated to conform to the new\r\nstate of affairs, and prepared to offer armed resistance to the king’s\r\ndemands. Henry left Oxford, whither he had gone at the beginning of the\r\nnew year, 1155, and moved slowly northwards, halting apparently at\r\nNorthampton to re-create Hugh Bigot, Earl of Norfolk, his charter taking\r\nthe form of a re-creation rather than a confirmation, possibly as a hint\r\nto the shifty earl that his dignities were not secure beyond all risk.\r\nBy the time that the king reached York Earl William, finding himself\r\nunsupported, had reconsidered his position and wisely submitted to the\r\nroyal demands, surrendering his fortress of Scarborough. A precipitous\r\nbluff projecting into the sea, whose waves washed it on three sides,\r\njoined to the mainland only on the west by a narrow neck, the rock of\r\nScarborough presented an ideal spot for the rearing of a castle, and\r\nhere accordingly the earl had set his great stronghold, surrounding the\r\nspacious plateau on the top of the cliff with a wall, digging a well,\r\nand building a keep four-square upon the narrow neck by which alone\r\naccess was possible. Nestling against the western base of the rock lay\r\nthe little town of Scarborough, itself surrounded with a wall and thus\r\nforming an outwork of the castle. The position was too formidable to be\r\nleft in the hands of a subject, and King Henry took care to retain it\r\nfor the remainder of his reign; and when in the course of a few years\r\nthe earl’s keep fell into decay, it was rebuilt and enlarged at a cost\r\nequivalent to some £10,000 of modern money, the work beginning in 1159\r\nand spreading over the next three years.[8]\r\n\r\nOn his way either to or from York Henry appears to have visited Lincoln,\r\nthe priory of Spalding, and the great abbeys of Peterborough, Thorney,\r\nand Ramsey. The news of the king’s approach to Nottingham so stirred the\r\nguilty conscience of William Peverel, burdened with the murder of the\r\nEarl of Chester, that he sought to save body and soul at the expense of\r\nhis possessions by becoming a monk in a priory of which he was himself\r\npatron at Lenton. It was no doubt while in the neighbourhood of\r\nNottingham that the king received information of the birth of his second\r\nson, Henry, on 28th February, and shortly afterwards he returned to\r\nLondon, where he held a council at the end of March. During the previous\r\nthree months Roger, Earl of Hereford, had been contemplating resistance\r\nto the king’s demands for the surrender of his castles, but the\r\narguments of his kinsman, Gilbert Foliot, Bishop of Hereford, supported\r\nby the success of Henry’s expedition into Yorkshire, brought him to a\r\nwiser mind, and he placed the castles of Hereford and Gloucester in the\r\nking’s hands. Hugh de Mortimer, however, the great lord of the Welsh\r\nMarches, who had been the chief instigator of Earl Roger’s disaffection,\r\nmaintained his attitude of opposition and fortified his castles of\r\nCleobury, Wigmore, and Bridgnorth. Henry accordingly moved west,\r\nhalting at Wallingford, where on 10th April he held a council at which\r\nthe nobles swore allegiance to his elder son William, or in the event of\r\nhis death, which occurred the following year, to the infant Henry.\r\nMortimer’s strongholds were invested and, after some resistance,\r\nreduced, he himself making his peace with the king at Bridgnorth early\r\nin July.\r\n\r\nWith the collapse of Mortimer’s rebellion all active opposition to the\r\nking ceased. Henry, Bishop of Winchester, brother of the late King\r\nStephen, having possibly displayed his sympathy with the defeated party\r\ntoo prominently, deemed it prudent to retire to the Continent, leaving\r\nhis castles to share the fate of other private fortresses. Peace being\r\nthus ensured in England, King Henry was at liberty to look abroad, and\r\nat a council held in Winchester at Michaelmas he broached the subject of\r\nthe conquest of Ireland, proposing to subdue that turbulent and\r\nuncivilised country and place it under the rule of his brother William.\r\nTo strengthen his position and justify his action he sent John of\r\nSalisbury to represent to the pope the urgent need for reform,\r\necclesiastical and political, in Ireland. The pope at this time, Adrian\r\nIV., was an Englishman, his father being a poor clerk of Langley, who\r\nentered the monastery of St. Albans shortly after his son’s birth: the\r\nyoung Nicholas Brakespere, endeavouring to follow his father’s example,\r\nwas rejected by the authorities at St. Albans and went out of England to\r\nProvence, where he rose to be abbot of St. Ruphus; his monks,\r\nregretting their election of a foreigner, appealed to the pope to depose\r\nhim, and he again prospered by rejection, as he was at once promoted to\r\nthe bishopric of Albano and made papal legate to Scandinavia, where his\r\nsuccess was so great that, upon the death of Pope Eugenius III., in\r\nDecember 1154, he was elected to the papacy, taking the title of Adrian\r\nIV. Pope Adrian heartily approved of Henry’s project, and sent back John\r\nof Salisbury with a letter commending the proposed crusade and an\r\nemerald ring symbolic of the sovereignty of Ireland, with which he\r\ninvested Henry by virtue of the alleged supremacy of the popes over all\r\nislands.[10] Feeling in England, however, does not seem to have been in\r\nfavour of the expedition, and the empress, doubtless foreseeing that\r\nWilliam would find the Irish throne an insecure position of little glory\r\nand less profit, strongly opposed the project. Her influence with her\r\nson was sufficient to cause him to abandon the idea, or at least to\r\npostpone it until a more favourable opportunity.\r\n\r\nHenry kept Christmas at Westminster, and early in January 1156 sailed\r\nfrom Dover for Normandy, his last act before leaving being to re-create\r\nAubrey de Vere, who the previous year had paid 500 marks to be High\r\nChamberlain of England,[11] Earl of Oxford. At the beginning of the\r\nnext month he met Louis VII. on the borders of France and Normandy and\r\ndid homage to him for all his continental possessions, including Anjou\r\nand Maine, which his brother Geoffrey claimed under his father’s will.\r\nGeoffrey, persisting in his claims and refusing Henry’s offers of\r\ncompensation, garrisoned his castles of Loudun, Chinon, and Mirabeau. By\r\nthe beginning of July the two latter were in the king’s hands, and\r\nGeoffrey had agreed to be content with retaining Loudun and a money\r\npension. Shortly afterwards the people of Nantes and Lower Brittany\r\nexpelled their ruler, Count Hoel, and elected Geoffrey in his place.\r\nHenry gladly assented to the election, and upon Geoffrey’s death in 1158\r\nsuccessfully enforced his own claims, as heir to his brother, against\r\nConan, Earl of Richmond and Count of Upper Brittany.\r\n\r\nThe king’s first daughter, Maud, had been born at London early in the\r\nsummer, and towards the end of August Queen Eleanor crossed from England\r\nand joined her husband in Anjou. The court returned to England in April\r\n1157, and a short tour was made through the eastern counties, the king\r\nwearing his crown in state at Bury St. Edmunds on 19th May and staying\r\nthe following week at Colchester. In continuation of his former policy\r\nhe now caused William de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, to surrender the\r\ncastles of Norwich and Pevensey, which he had hitherto retained,\r\napparently compensating him by further additions to his great estates\r\nin Norfolk.[12] Earl Hugh of Norfolk was also deprived of his castles,\r\nand in Essex one of Earl Geoffrey’s strongholds was destroyed.\r\n\r\nHenry was now so firmly established on the throne that he could insist\r\nupon a far more important resumption of territory, and accordingly he\r\ndemanded from the young King Malcolm of Scotland the cession of\r\nNorthumberland, Westmoreland, and Cumberland. Malcolm, unable to offer\r\nany effective resistance to his demands, travelled south through\r\nYorkshire and Lincolnshire to the castle of the Peak. Meanwhile Henry,\r\nafter holding a council on 17th July at Northampton, where he left the\r\nqueen, was moving westwards. The two kings met at the Peak and passed on\r\ntogether to Chester, where Malcolm formally restored the northern\r\ncounties, receiving in exchange the earldom of Huntingdon, for which he\r\ndid homage to Henry. The Scottish king then returned to his own country\r\nto repress the rebellion raised by his nobles in indignation at his\r\nsurrender to the English demands, while Henry completed his arrangements\r\nfor the invasion of North Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE WELSH WARS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Welsh, who had been brought into at least nominal subjection by the\r\nstrong hand of Henry I., were not slow to avail themselves of England’s\r\nweakness under Stephen to regain their liberty. Unfortunately the chief\r\nresult of the removal of foreign control was the increase of those\r\ninternal disputes which had always formed so large a part of the\r\nnation’s history.[13] Prince warred with prince, brother against\r\nbrother, and cousin against cousin; treachery was met with treachery,\r\nand in the end the inevitable appeal of a disappointed claimant for\r\nforeign assistance against his successful rival brought an English army\r\ninto Welsh soil once more. Owain Gwynedd, king of North Wales, had\r\nexiled his brother Cadwalader and seized his possessions, and it was on\r\nthe pretext of restoring Cadwalader that Henry assembled his forces at\r\nChester and prepared for the invasion of Wales in the summer of 1157.\r\n\r\nThe task was formidable alike from the nature of the country and the\r\ninhabitants. Wales was divided into three parts--North Wales or\r\nVenedotia, South Wales or Demetia, and Powys, but, save that the lance\r\nwas the weapon of the northern Welsh and the bow of the southern, the\r\ndivisions were arbitrary and artificial, and unconnected with any\r\ndifferences in the character of the population. With the exception of\r\nthe Brabantine mercenaries, a race apart, a tribe of professional\r\nIshmaelites, ready to turn their hands against any man for pay, no\r\nnation was so thoroughly permeated by the martial spirit as the Welsh.\r\nWith the English and Normans war was the business of the gentry, but\r\nthroughout Wales the young men of all classes, gentle and peasant alike,\r\ndevoted their leisure to the practice of military exercises and strove\r\nto perfect themselves in the art of war. Possessing a country whose\r\nwoods and mountains, intersected by torrents and marshy valleys, were\r\nadmirably adapted for the ambuscade and other tricks of guerilla\r\nwarfare, the Welsh had cultivated those qualities which enabled them to\r\nmake best use of these natural advantages. Simple in their requirements\r\nfor food or dress, they were hardy, active, and endowed with wonderful\r\npowers of endurance. Of defensive armour they made practically no use,\r\nyet they did not hesitate to encounter any foe, however well equipped;\r\ntheir first attack, delivered to an accompaniment of yells and braying\r\ntrumpets, was furious, but, as is inevitable when light armed troops\r\nengage with heavy, if it did not prove immediately successful, they soon\r\nbroke and fled, always ready, however, to resume the fight if\r\nopportunity offered. They did not disdain to strengthen their position\r\nwith fortifications, and the whole land bristled with castles,[14]\r\nhardly a year passing without record of the erection, capture,\r\nrecapture, or destruction of one or more castles in the course of the\r\nincessant wars waged either between local chieftains or with the Norman\r\nbarons of the Marches; yet it was emphatically in the strategical use\r\nwhich they made of the natural advantages of their country that the\r\nWelsh were pre-eminent.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the straightforward pitched battle between troops\r\ncontending stubbornly under the open sky tends to promote the honourable\r\ntraditions of chivalry, while the ambush, surprise, and night attack\r\nfoster treachery and deceit. Certain it is that the Welsh were notorious\r\namongst their contemporaries as liars and perjurers, men to whom the\r\nmost solemn oaths were not binding; and their Norman neighbours, the\r\nlords Marchers, were not slow to follow their example, so that the\r\nhistory of the border warfare is constantly stained with treachery and\r\nbroken oaths. The corollary to “Taffy was a Welshman” that “Taffy was a\r\nthief” was already recognised as an axiom at the time of the Domesday\r\nSurvey, when the customs of the Herefordshire Welsh contained provisions\r\nfor correcting this reprehensible propensity. Yet in spite of this\r\ntendency to enrich themselves at the expense of their neighbours the\r\nWelsh were open-handed and generous; none need beg for a meal, nor need\r\nthe wayfarer fear to lack a resting-place. Hospitality was not so much a\r\nduty as a commonplace of life amongst this people, and exercised without\r\nhesitation. The food was simple, for though orgies of gluttony and\r\ndrunkenness were only too common after a successful plundering raid, yet\r\nthe habitual excess prevalent in England was here unknown; but this\r\nsimplicity was more than atoned for by the charms of female society and\r\nthe delights of music. In music the Welsh surpassed even the Irish; in\r\nevery house a harp was to be found, and it is noteworthy that they\r\nshared with the men of Yorkshire the peculiarity of singing not in\r\nunison but in parts. In their rhythmical chanted songs the nation’s\r\nexceptional powers of rhetoric found their highest form of expression,\r\nand their bards were held in such honour that in 1157, when Morgan, son\r\nof King Owain Gwynedd, was murdered, it is expressly noted that with him\r\nwas slain Gwrgant ap Rhys, “the best poet.” Thus with music and eloquent\r\nconversation were passed the restful hours of the day, the remainder of\r\nwhich would be devoted to military exercise, hunting, the tending of\r\nflocks and herds, or, more rarely, agriculture, for which the poor soil\r\nand the inclinations of the people were alike unsuited. They were thus\r\nperilously dependent upon England for much of their food supply and\r\ntherefore liable to be starved into surrender in the event of war.\r\n\r\nThe antagonism existing between the peoples of England and Wales found\r\nsome echo in the relations between the two branches of the Church. The\r\nWelsh Church, possessing a far longer continuous history than that of\r\nEngland, was less completely under the influence of Rome, and retained\r\nmany primitive customs which were strange and even abhorrent to the more\r\northodox. Their clergy continued to marry, with the result that many\r\nbenefices had become hereditary, descending from father to son like\r\nsecular property. But if the marriage of the clergy was a primitive\r\ncondition no longer canonical, the marriage customs of the laity were\r\nstill more shocking to the orthodox, being in many cases not merely\r\nuncanonical but clearly survivals from pagan times, indefensible on any\r\ngrounds except those of crude common-sense. The English Church, having\r\ncontrol of the four sees of St. David’s, Llandaff, Bangor, and St.\r\nAsaph, should have been able to execute the necessary reforms, but\r\nunfortunately Norman prejudice forbade the appointment of a Welshman to\r\nany post of authority in Wales, and the sees were consequently occupied\r\nby foreigners who, for the most part, could not speak the language of\r\ntheir flocks, and only too frequently used their power to increase their\r\nslender revenues at the expense of their clergy. Despised by the Norman\r\nclergy as corrupt and by the nobles as barbarous, it is possible that\r\nthe Welsh appeared to Henry less formidable opponents than they really\r\nwere. Moreover, he disregarded the advice of the lords of the Marches,\r\nwhose whole lives were spent in fighting their Welsh neighbours, and\r\ndetermined to conduct his expedition on the most approved continental\r\nlines. Owain had entrenched himself at Basingwerk, and Henry accordingly\r\nadvanced along the coast for some distance, and then, meditating a\r\nflanking movement, led a detachment of his forces through the woods of\r\nConsillt. This gave the Welsh the opportunity for which they had been\r\nwaiting, and no sooner were the Normans entangled in the woods than the\r\nforces under Owain’s sons, David and Cynan, fell upon them, inflicting\r\nheavy losses. Caught at a disadvantage the invaders were thrown into\r\nconfusion; two of their leaders, Eustace Fitz-John and Robert de Courcy,\r\nwere slain, and a cry was raised that the king had been killed. Panic\r\nensued, and it was afterwards said that Henry of Essex, the Constable of\r\nEngland, had thrown down the royal standard and fled. If the Constable\r\nreally displayed cowardice on this occasion the fact must have been\r\nhushed up, for nothing is heard of it for six years, until in 1163\r\nRobert de Montfort made it the subject of a formal accusation. Such an\r\naccusation could have only one outcome, and accordingly a duel was\r\nfought between the two parties at Reading in the king’s presence, when\r\nHenry of Essex, rashly abandoning a successful defence for the\r\noffensive, was defeated and left for dead on the ground, but being\r\nnursed back to life by the monks of Reading, joined their community and\r\nspent the remainder of his days in their abbey. It is noteworthy that\r\nthe challenger, Robert de Montfort, was a connection of his opponent’s\r\nand not improbably a rival claimant to the constableship, which Henry\r\nhad inherited through the heiress of Hugh de Montfort.[15] On the whole\r\nit would seem more probable that Robert should have made his accusation\r\nas a taunt based on some flying rumour and that the result of the duel\r\nwas unjust, than that King Henry should have condoned the Constable’s\r\ncowardice and allowed him to continue in honour at his court.\r\n\r\nHowever Henry of Essex may have behaved, it is clear that the Normans\r\nhad suffered a severe defeat, and Henry in a furious rage drew off his\r\ntroops and rejoined the main body of his army, with which he advanced\r\nunopposed to Rhuddlan, Owain having withdrawn from Basingwerk to Conway.\r\nMeanwhile the fleet, which was acting in unison with the land forces,\r\nhad been despatched to Anglesea, to ravage that fertile island, the\r\ngranary of North Wales. But here bad discipline was the cause of a\r\nsevere check; the attractions of looting churches and monasteries proved\r\ntoo great for the royal forces and delivered them into the hands of the\r\never vigilant natives. The sailors lost their commander, William\r\nTrenchemer, and most of their officers, while amongst the men of note\r\nwho fell was Henry, the king’s half-uncle, son of Henry I. by the famous\r\nWelsh princess Nest. In spite of these two initial successes Owain felt\r\nhimself in a position of danger, and preferring to make terms rather\r\nthan to have them forced upon him, made peace and gave hostages to\r\nHenry. Cadwalader was restored to his possessions, and homage was done\r\nby Owain to the English king, and the English frontier was once more\r\npushed as far forward as Rhuddlan, where, as also at Basingwerk, Henry\r\nrestored the castle. The campaign, therefore, might be regarded as\r\nfairly successful, although the only two engagements recorded had been\r\ndisastrous.\r\n\r\nAlthough Owain Gwynedd and the other princes had come to terms with King\r\nHenry, the redoubtable Rhys, son of Gruffudd of South Wales, proposed to\r\ncontinue the war. Finding, however, that he would receive no support\r\nfrom any other native princes, he was persuaded to make his peace with\r\nthe king, who in return promised to grant him a complete _cantref_ of\r\nland. The spirit of the agreement was broken by the grant of the land in\r\nscattered portions instead of in a continuous block, but Rhys accepted\r\nthe gift and remained quiet until he found that the king would not do\r\nhim justice against Walter Clifford, when he took the law into his own\r\nhands and made a series of successful attacks upon the strongholds of\r\nthe Norman barons in Cardigan. About the same time, in 1158, Yvor the\r\nLittle, a noble of Glamorgan, being deprived of his lands by Earl\r\nWilliam of Gloucester, made a daring night attack upon the castle of\r\nCardiff, and in spite of its strength and the imposing numbers of its\r\ngarrison, said to have numbered 120 men-at-arms, besides archers and\r\nothers, carried off the earl with his countess and their son, who were\r\nonly released after more than full restitution had been made to Yvor.\r\nMeanwhile Rhys, encouraged by his successes in Cardigan, attacked\r\nCaermarthen, and Henry, who was preparing for a great expedition into\r\nthe south of France, was obliged to send a force under the Earls of\r\nCornwall, Gloucester, and Clare to relieve the castle. This they did,\r\nand they were also successful in bringing Rhys to accept terms of peace.\r\n\r\nPeace, so far as it ever existed on the Welsh borders, continued for a\r\nshort time, but when Henry returned to England in 1163, he found the\r\ncountry in so disturbed a state that he was obliged to lead an army\r\nagainst Rhys. The latter offered little or no active opposition, and the\r\nexpedition took the form of a military progress through Glamorgan and\r\nGower towards Caermarthen and as far as Pencader, returning by the\r\nmountains of Plinlimmon to Radnor. It is said that during this progress\r\nthe invading host came to a stream called Nant Pencarn, where the\r\nnatives anxiously waited to see whether Henry would fulfil in his own\r\nperson a traditional prophecy that the crossing of the ancient ford by a\r\nbrave man with a freckled face should foreshadow the defeat of the\r\nWelsh. When they saw the king ride past the old ford and set his horse\r\nto cross by one newer and better known, the Welsh set up such a blare of\r\nhorns and trumpets that his horse took fright, and the king, turning\r\nround, made for the older ford and dashed across, this time without any\r\norchestral welcome.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this campaign Rhys, with Owain of North Wales and other\r\nprinces, attended Henry’s court at Woodstock and did homage to him there\r\nin July 1163. The king, apparently meditating the confiscation of his\r\nestates or possibly the extortion of a ransom, sent a knight to visit\r\nDynevor, the capital of South Wales, and to report upon the nature of\r\nthe country; the priest, however, who acted as guide, while professing\r\nto go by the best route, took the unsuspecting knight by all the worst\r\nand most impassable tracks, and so contrived to impress him with the\r\nutter poverty of the land and the inhabitants that the king, on the\r\nstrength of his report, abandoned his first intention and released Rhys,\r\nonly taking from him hostages for his good behaviour. Hardly had Rhys\r\nreturned than he renewed the struggle, recapturing the whole district of\r\nCardigan, invading Pembrokeshire and despoiling the Norman and Flemish\r\nsettlers. His example was speedily followed by Owain Gwynedd and his\r\nsons, who ravaged the district round Rhuddlan. In October 1164 Henry had\r\nissued orders for a force to be raised against Rhys, and on his return\r\nto England in the following May, he found this force ready and with it\r\npushed hastily forward to Rhuddlan. Having relieved pressure in this\r\ndistrict for the time being he returned to England to collect a larger\r\narmy, furiously vowing to destroy the whole nation of Welsh. The border\r\nfortresses were set in order from Abergavenny, Grosmont, Llantilis, and\r\nSkenfrith in the south to Montgomery, Shrawardine, and Chirk in the\r\nnorth; foreign mercenaries were brought over and provided with arms,\r\nErnald the armourer providing 300 bucklers for their use; lances and\r\narrows were bought in Oxford and elsewhere and despatched to the\r\nfrontier; and, above all, large sums of money were extorted from the\r\ncities, prelates, and nobles for the conduct of the war.[16] Operations\r\non a small scale seem to have been carried on from Abergavenny, but the\r\nking, with the main part of his imposing army, advanced from Shrewsbury\r\nto Oswestry and so into Powys. For once the Welsh were united; Rhys of\r\nSouth Wales, Owain Gwynedd and Cadwalader his brother, the former ally\r\nof the English, the two sons of Madog of Powys, lesser princes such as\r\nOwain Cyveliog and Jorwerth the Red, all with their whole following were\r\nassembled to oppose the invader.\r\n\r\nHenry advanced down the valley of the Ceiriog and, mindful of former\r\ndisaster, endeavoured to protect his flanks by cutting down the woods.\r\nIndecisive skirmishing took place, resulting in heavy losses to both\r\nsides, but the Welsh avoided a pitched battle and retired before the\r\nroyal forces until the latter had penetrated as far as the mountains of\r\nBerwyn in Merionethshire. Here they encamped, ravaging the country round\r\nand plundering the churches, to the intense anger of the Welsh, who\r\nalways scrupulously observed the sanctity of churches. Punishment\r\nspeedily overtook the impious host: tremendous storms of rain,\r\nexceptionally vehement even for Wales, coupled with a shortage of\r\nprovisions, drove the English back in a disorderly and disastrous\r\nretreat to Chester, where Henry waited for the arrival of a fleet from\r\nIreland. When the ships came they proved to be insufficient for the\r\nconduct of further operations against the Welsh. The king, furious at\r\nhis ill-success, took a mean revenge by barbarously mutilating the sons\r\nof Rhys and Owain and a score of other hostages in his power.[17]\r\n\r\nHardly had the English army retired from Wales when Rhys stormed the\r\ncastle of Cardigan and captured its lord, Robert Fitz-Stephen. Next\r\nyear, in 1165, the Normans and Flemings of Pembroke made two\r\nunsuccessful attempts to retake Cardigan, while in the north Owain\r\nGwynedd destroyed Basingwerk. Internal dissensions led to the ejection\r\nfrom their lands of Jorwerth the Red and Owain Cyveliog,[18] and the\r\nlatter, in 1166, assisted the Normans to gain a small success in the\r\ncapture of the castle of Caereinion, but this was more than\r\ncounterbalanced by the action of Rhys and Owain Gwynedd, who, after a\r\nthree months’ siege, captured the castles of Rhuddlan and Prestatyn. The\r\ndevelopment of Irish affairs now made friendly relations with Wales\r\nimportant, the main route to Ireland being by way of South Wales and the\r\nports of Pembrokeshire. Accordingly we find Henry becoming reconciled to\r\nRhys in 1171, and from henceforth treating him with an honourable\r\ncourtesy which the Welsh prince reciprocated. Peace, therefore, varied\r\nwith occasional border skirmishes, continued between England and Wales\r\nuntil the end of Henry’s reign, and the Welsh, deprived of the pleasure\r\nof molesting the foreigner, turned with the greater zest to the task of\r\ncutting one another’s throats.\r\n\r\nThe invariable failure of Henry’s military policy in Wales was due to\r\nhis persistent disregard of the local lords of the marches and reliance\r\nupon men famous in continental warfare but totally ignorant of the very\r\ndifferent conditions prevailing in the mountains and forests of Wales.\r\nSuch a man as Gerald de Barri could have given the king far more useful\r\nadvice in the conduct of a Welsh campaign than any of his great Norman\r\nbarons. That acute historian afterwards set out at length the measures\r\nnecessary for the conquest of his native country. No expedition should\r\nbe undertaken hastily, but careful preparations should be made, allies\r\nsecured, and internal divisions carefully fostered; castles should be\r\nbuilt along the frontier, trade with England, especially in provisions,\r\nstopped, and the coasts blockaded. This would, as a rule, be sufficient\r\nto bring them to terms, but if military operations were needful then an\r\nadvance should be made in the early spring before the trees came into\r\nleaf; the troops should be light armed, and preferably men of the border\r\nused to the country rather than Flemish or Brabantines, good as the\r\nlatter were on their own ground. The operations should be conducted by\r\ncounsel of the lords marchers, and heavy losses must be expected and\r\nborne with equanimity, for while mercenaries are easily replaced the\r\nWelsh could not replace their men. Once subdued the natives should be\r\ntreated with justice and kindness so long as they remain quiet, but\r\ntheir rulers should be ever watchful and should punish rebellion with\r\nseverity. To diminish the chance of revolt the intervals of peace ought\r\nto be used for the building of roads and of castles, and at the same\r\ntime the English border towns along the Severn might well have special\r\nprivileges granted them to facilitate their growth, and in return they\r\nshould be bound to maintain a fitting provision of arms and horses and\r\nto practise universal military training. “Yet for all this the nation\r\nshall not perish utterly, and at the last great Day of Judgment this\r\nlittle spot of land shall be answered for by the Welsh race, still\r\nspeaking in their ancient tongue.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the ingloriously successful Welsh campaign of 1157 Henry seems to\r\nhave returned to Woodstock and there rejoined the queen, who had given\r\nbirth on 8th September to a third son, Richard. The remainder of the\r\nautumn was no doubt spent in hunting, but at the end of the year the\r\ncourt moved northwards to Lincoln, where Christmas was kept. A local\r\ntradition, or superstition, forbade the wearing of the royal crown\r\nwithin the city walls. Stephen, it is true, had defied this tradition in\r\n1146, but the fortunes of Stephen were not such as to make his action an\r\nencouraging precedent, and Henry, preferring to be on the safe side,\r\ncaused the ceremonial of coronation to take place in the church of St.\r\nMary of Wigford outside the walls. From Lincoln the king moved on, at\r\nthe beginning of 1158, to Carlisle to meet Malcolm of Scotland. The\r\nresult of the meeting was unsatisfactory, and Henry abandoned his\r\noriginal intention of bestowing upon the young king that honour of\r\nknighthood which he had himself once received at the hands of Malcolm’s\r\npredecessor, David.\r\n\r\nEaster in that year fell on 20th April, when the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map illustrating the Campaigns of Henry II in FRANCE\r\n\r\n(_The portion of France under Henry’s sovereignty is tinted._)]\r\n\r\ncourt was at Worcester, and Henry and Eleanor celebrated the festival by\r\nobserving, for the last time, the elaborate ritual of coronation. When\r\nthe service was over they laid their crowns upon the altar and vowed to\r\nwear them no more. There would seem to have been no deeper reason for\r\nthis renunciation than Henry’s dislike of ceremony. To the restless\r\nking, who never sat except on the saddle and who whispered and scribbled\r\nnotes to relieve the boredom of Mass, the elaborate ceremonial of the\r\ncrown-wearing must have been distasteful and wearisome. The outward pomp\r\nand circumstance of royalty were nothing to the man whose rule extended\r\nfrom the Pennines to the Pyrenees, and the glitter of a crown was no\r\nenhancement to the clearest head in Europe, throbbing full with\r\npolitical problems, national and international. The kings of Wales and\r\nScotland had done homage; Godred, King of Man and the Isles, was in\r\nattendance at Worcester; embassies had been received or were on their\r\nway from the kings of Norway, the King of Jerusalem, and the Emperor\r\nFrederic; and Henry was scheming for the further aggrandisement of his\r\nfamily and the extension of his continental dominions.\r\n\r\nLouis VII. had by his second wife, Constance of Castille, a daughter\r\nMargaret, at this time a baby of a few months old, and Henry determined\r\nto forestall other possible aspirants for the hand of this very youthful\r\nheiress. Accordingly, in the summer of 1158, he despatched his\r\nchancellor, Thomas Becket, to demand the hand of Margaret for his\r\neldest surviving son, Henry, who was now rather more than two years old.\r\nIf the king was inclined to underrate the value of display and outward\r\nmagnificence, his chancellor was very far from falling into the same\r\nerror. Becket, the king’s trusted minister and most intimate friend,\r\npresented a curious contrast in every way to his royal master. He was\r\ntall, of commanding presence, with clean-cut features and shapely hands;\r\nin his splendour he was a prototype of Cardinal Wolsey, but stood out\r\nthe more prominently, as the sober court of Henry II. made a better foil\r\nthan the magnificence of Henry VIII. Intensely self-centred, whatever he\r\ntook up he threw himself into heart and soul, and as he was to prove the\r\nmost ecclesiastical of ecclesiastics, so now that he was the greatest\r\nofficer in the land he saw to it that his dignity was becomingly\r\nsupported. Lavish in his expenditure, he kept open house and enriched\r\nhis friends with open-handed generosity. Yet, though luxury and\r\nostentation formed the note of his household, it is to his honour that\r\nin an age when views on morals were more than lax he was known\r\npre-eminently as a man of clean life.\r\n\r\nThe embassy to the French court presented Becket with an admirable\r\nopportunity for gratifying his taste for pageantry, and the splendour of\r\nhis cavalcade struck amazement into the minds of the natives and\r\nimpressed them with the greatness of the English king. In front of the\r\nprocession came the serving men and lackeys on foot in groups of ten or\r\na dozen singing English songs, and some way behind them came huntsmen\r\nleading dogs and with their greyhounds in leash; then there rattled over\r\nthe stones six great covered waggons containing the baggage of the\r\nchancellor’s household, and two other waggons loaded solely with the\r\nvery best English ale as a present for the French. Each of these carts\r\nwas drawn by five magnificent horses, each attended by its own groom,\r\nand as guard to each cart was a great mastiff. Next came the pack horses\r\nwith their drivers, and as a picturesque touch there sat upon the back\r\nof each horse an ape or monkey. After these came the squires, some\r\ncarrying the shields of their masters and leading their chargers, others\r\nbearing hawks and falcons; then the officers of the household, and the\r\nknights and clerks riding two and two, and finally the chancellor\r\nhimself with his friends. Becket did not allow the effect of his arrival\r\nto be diminished by any failure to maintain his state during his stay in\r\nParis, and the extravagance and luxury of his household at the Temple,\r\nwhich had been assigned for his accommodation, became proverbial. And\r\nwhen the business of his mission had been successfully settled he\r\ndistributed all his gold and silver plate, his furs and gorgeous robes,\r\nhorses and the other magnificent appointments of his establishment in\r\nlavish largesse.\r\n\r\nHenry followed close on the heels of his splendid ambassador to complete\r\nthe negotiations for the proposed matrimonial alliance. The two kings\r\nmet first on the borders of France and Normandy, near Gisors, and Henry\r\nthen paid a formal visit to Louis in Paris, where his unassuming\r\ncourtesy and refusal of all ceremonial honours made an impression quite\r\nas favourable as the magnificence of his chancellor had done. Not only\r\ndid Louis fall in with the suggestion for the betrothal of Margaret to\r\nthe young Henry, but he also agreed to assist the English king in his\r\nclaim on the territory of Nantes and Lower Brittany. Geoffrey, Henry’s\r\nyounger brother, had held this province for life by the election of the\r\ninhabitants, but upon his death in July 1158, Conan, Count of Brittany,\r\nclaimed that it should revert to him. In face of the united forces of\r\nEngland and France Conan could only submit, surrendering Nantes in\r\nreturn for a confirmation of his rights in the remainder of Brittany.\r\nAfter taking over Nantes Henry led a brilliant little expedition against\r\nThouars, in Poitou, capturing that strong position and its rebellious\r\nlord with surprising rapidity, and then, turning north, met King Louis\r\nat Le Mans, accompanied him on a pilgrimage to St. Michael’s Mount, and\r\nentertained him for some time at Rouen. Thanks to the French king’s good\r\noffices several favourable arrangements were made for the surrender of\r\nborder castles to Henry, and it was with satisfaction that Henry could\r\nlook back upon the recent results of his diplomacy when he celebrated\r\nthe feast of Christmas that year at Cherbourg with Queen Eleanor, who\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEAL OF LOUIS VII (1/1)]\r\n\r\nhad given birth to her fourth son, Geoffrey, in the previous September.\r\n\r\nHis policy having so far met with such remarkable success Henry now\r\ndecided to revive his wife’s ancient and shadowy claim to the important\r\nprovince of Toulouse. This province had been sold by one of Queen\r\nEleanor’s ancestors to his brother, Raymond of St. Gilles, but the\r\nlegality of the sale had been questioned on more than one occasion, and\r\nLouis VII., at the time that Eleanor was his wife, had prepared to\r\nenforce his claim, but had come to an amicable agreement with the Count\r\nof St. Gilles, giving him to wife his sister Constance, widow of King\r\nStephen’s son Eustace. Henry now made warlike preparations on an\r\nunprecedented scale, securing as an ally Raymond Berenger, virtual King\r\nof Arragon and Duke of Provence but proudly content to be known by his\r\nhumbler ancestral title of Count of Barcelona, and calling on all his\r\nfiefs, English and continental, for aids of men and money. In the\r\nimposing army which marched upon Toulouse in July 1159, practically all\r\nthe great barons of England and Normandy were present with their\r\nretinues, the chancellor as usual outshining his peers in the number and\r\nsplendour of his knights. Malcolm of Scotland came with a band of his\r\nyoung nobles, and was rewarded by Henry with the coveted honour of\r\nknighthood, and there was one of the Welsh princes; but the main body of\r\nthe troops consisted of Welsh and other mercenaries, hired with the\r\nmoney wrung from the great prelates, the larger towns, and the Jews and\r\nother wealthy non-combatants. Such a force could easily have captured\r\nToulouse, but King Louis had hastened to the aid of his brother-in-law\r\nand was within the town. For Henry to attack would therefore mean a\r\ndirect assault upon the man who, as King of France, was technically his\r\nover-lord and suzerain, a breach of feudal law which Henry, to the\r\ndisgust of Becket and other less scrupulous men, refused to commit. The\r\nonly alternative was a blockade, and this proving futile and ineffectual\r\nthe great army withdrew at the end of September, having achieved\r\npractically nothing but the capture of Cahors. On his way north,\r\nhowever, Henry was able to induce the Count of Evreux to hand over the\r\ncastles of Montfort, Epernon, and Rochfort, and Louis, finding his lines\r\nof communication thus cut, hastily concluded peace.\r\n\r\nDuring this war Pope Adrian had died, and Cardinal Roland Bandinelli had\r\nbeen elected by a majority of the electoral college, and, after a little\r\nhesitation, had accepted the papacy under the title of Alexander III.;\r\nthe party of the Emperor Frederic, however, taking advantage of Roland’s\r\nhesitation, had declared their candidate, Octavian, elected, and had\r\nconsecrated him pope as Victor III. The question of which pope should be\r\nrecognised was discussed at councils held by Henry at Neufmarché in\r\nNormandy and by Louis at Beauvais, and in each case the decision was\r\ngiven in favour of Alexander, Victor being renounced as schismatic.\r\nThis result was largely due to the eloquence of Alexander’s legate,\r\nCardinal William of Pavia. He, with Cardinal Henry of Pisa, was at the\r\nEnglish king’s court at the end of October 1160, when the news arrived\r\nthat Louis, within a fortnight of his wife’s death, had, in his\r\neagerness to obtain an heir to his throne, married a sister of Theobald,\r\nCount of Blois. Henry at once persuaded the cardinals to celebrate the\r\nmarriage between his son Henry, not yet five years old, and the French\r\nking’s daughter Margaret, then in her third year; the marriage having\r\nthus been performed with the consent of the Church, as stipulated in his\r\ntreaty with Louis, Henry was entitled to demand as Margaret’s marriage\r\nportion the surrender of the Norman Vexin and its castles of Gisors,\r\nNéaufles, and Neufchâtel, which he accordingly received from the three\r\nTemplars who were acting as trustees of the settlement.\r\n\r\nThis piece of sharp practice roused the resentment of Louis, but Henry’s\r\ndefences were too strong for any effective military operations, and,\r\nafter some desultory skirmishing on the borders, peace was patched up in\r\nthe summer of 1162 and continued without actual breach for some five\r\nyears. At the end of that time, in June 1167, Henry’s interference in\r\nthe affairs of Auvergne afforded Louis excuse for a fresh campaign,\r\nwhose prospects of success were the greater from its coincidence, no\r\ndoubt designed, with a rising on an unusually large scale amongst the\r\nunruly Breton nobles. The French accordingly ravaged the Norman border,\r\nbut Henry virtually brought the campaign to an end by a single brilliant\r\nstroke. Knowing the provisions and munitions of the French army had been\r\nstored at Chaumont, he marched against that town, and while his\r\nmen-at-arms engaged the garrison outside the walls his light-armed Welsh\r\nlevies swam down the river and, gaining access to the town by that\r\nunexpected quarter, set it on fire. The whole town was destroyed, many\r\nof its defenders slain or captured, and the rest driven into the castle,\r\nwhere Henry left them unmolested, content with the destruction of the\r\nstores. Although this practically put an end to hostilities, no peace\r\ncould be arranged until the French king’s impotent rage had been\r\nappeased, and the brilliant suggestion was therefore made by the Empress\r\nMaud that he should be allowed to burn some unfortified Norman town. Les\r\nAndelys was selected as the victim; the inhabitants were duly warned by\r\nHenry to leave the place, and the French army solemnly marched on the\r\ndeserted town and burnt it. Having cheaply regained his honour by this\r\npuerile act of revenge, Louis agreed, in August 1168, to a six months’\r\ntruce. This gave Henry time to suppress the rising in Brittany and\r\nanother in Poitou, while the refractory counts of Ponthieu and Perche\r\nreceived their chastisement during the ensuing negotiations, varied with\r\noccasional fighting, which resulted at last in a definite treaty of\r\npeace being concluded between the two kings in January 1169. By this\r\ntreaty it was agreed that Henry’s son, Richard, should be betrothed to\r\nthe French king’s daughter, Alais, and should hold Poitou and Guienne,\r\nwhile Geoffrey, who had married Count Conan’s daughter in 1166, should\r\nhold Brittany under his elder brother Henry.\r\n\r\nHenry’s two eldest sons were thus married or betrothed to daughters of\r\nKing Louis and his third son married to the heiress of Brittany; the\r\nyoungest, John, having only been born on Christmas Eve, 1166, was not\r\nyet provided for, but the king’s eldest daughter, Maud, had sailed from\r\nDover in the autumn of 1167, under the escort of the Archbishop-elect of\r\nCologne, the Earls of Arundel and Pembroke, and such lesser lords as\r\nReynold de Warenne and William Cheyney, to marry Henry, Duke of Saxony.\r\nThus by the power of the sword and the bond of marriage did Henry\r\nstrengthen his position on the Continent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE WITH BECKET\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the time that Henry was campaigning on the Norman borders, in\r\nApril 1161, Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury died. For nearly a year\r\nthe king kept the primacy vacant, but at last, in the spring of 1162, he\r\ndeclared his wish that Becket should take the archiepiscopate. The\r\nappointment, not unforeseen, of the courtly chancellor seems to have\r\nbeen distasteful to many of the clergy, but the only man who had the\r\ncourage to brave the king’s wrath by opposing the election of his\r\nfavourite was Gilbert Foliot, Bishop of Hereford, whose opposition was\r\nprobably increased in vehemence but diminished in effect by the fact\r\nthat he was himself Becket’s most dangerous rival in the race for the\r\nprimacy. Foliot’s protest was supported by the Empress Maud, who, as a\r\ndevoted daughter of the Church, doubtless considered Becket too lax and\r\nworldly for the post; but for once Henry disregarded his mother’s\r\nopinion. Becket himself must have seen in his promotion the chance of\r\nsatisfying his ambition; as chancellor he was the second man in the\r\nrealm, subject only to the king; but, subject to him, often directing\r\nthe royal policy, but always liable to be checked by an expression of\r\nthe royal will; as archbishop, with the divine authority of the Church\r\nbehind him, it would be for him to dictate and for the king to obey. Yet\r\nknowing, as he alone knew, the ultra-clerical course which he intended\r\nto take, he foresaw that it must sooner or later bring him into\r\ncollision with Henry, and forebodings for the future, more particularly\r\nregret for the inevitable disruption of the ancient bonds of friendship\r\nwhich bound him to the king, made him hesitate to grasp the prize for\r\nwhich he longed. At last the insistence of the king, coupled with the\r\npersuasions of Cardinal Henry of Pisa, overcame Becket’s half-hearted\r\nresistance, and in May 1162 he sailed for England for consecration.\r\n\r\nBesides the business attendant on his elevation to the primacy, the\r\nchancellor was charged with the carrying out of arrangements for an\r\nexpedition against the Welsh and also with the performance of fealty to\r\nthe king’s eldest son, Henry. The prince, who was at this time eight\r\nyears old, had been entrusted by his father to Becket’s care, and a very\r\ngenuine feeling of affection existed between the boy and his guardian,\r\nwhich was to continue, unaffected by the events of later years, until\r\nthe archbishop’s death. It was therefore not unsuitable that the last\r\nrecorded act of Becket in his official capacity as chancellor was to\r\nhead the assembled peers at Westminster in taking the oath of fealty to\r\nthe young Henry. On the occasion of this ceremony, which seems to have\r\nincluded an informal coronation--for a golden crown and regalia were\r\nmade for the prince[19]--Becket was formally elected to the see of\r\nCanterbury. The right of the monks of Christ Church, Canterbury, to\r\nappoint the archbishop, who was also nominally their abbot, was so far\r\nrecognised that they were directed by the king’s messengers, the Bishops\r\nof Chichester, Exeter, and Rochester, Richard de Lucy and his brother\r\nthe Abbot of Battle, to hold an election, but they were told definitely\r\nthat their choice must fall on the chancellor. This formality over,\r\nthere arose the question of consecration. The right to perform this\r\nceremony was disputed between Roger, Archbishop of York, as primate, the\r\nBishop of Rochester as Vicar of Canterbury, and the Bishop of Winchester\r\nas Precentor of Canterbury, while a claim was also put in by the bishop\r\nof one of the Welsh sees as the senior member of the episcopal bench.\r\nThe see of London, whose bishop, as Dean of Canterbury, would have had\r\nthe best claim to officiate, was vacant, but the dean and canons\r\nappointed Henry, Bishop of Winchester, to act for them, and to him\r\neventually was assigned the honour of officiating.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, 2nd June, Becket, who was still in deacons’ orders, was\r\nordained priest, and on the following day he was consecrated\r\narchbishop. To commemorate the occasion he ordained that the Sunday\r\nfollowing Whitsunday should in future be kept as a great festival in\r\nhonour of the Holy Trinity,[20] and even the zeal of the Reformers\r\nagainst the cult of Thomas of Canterbury did not blot out from the\r\ncalendar of the English Church Trinity Sunday.\r\n\r\nThe consecration of Thomas as Archbishop of Canterbury was indeed an\r\nevent worthy of commemoration, forming as it did the prelude to the\r\nstruggle between clerical and lay power which was to occupy the next ten\r\nyears of Henry’s reign. This struggle presents a curious problem of\r\nhistorical perspective. Seen through the atmosphere of the contemporary\r\nchronicle or through the rarified medium of history the Becket\r\ncontroversy presents very different features. To contemporaries it\r\nseemed of overpowering importance, eclipsing all other events of the\r\ntime and entailing issues of enormous weight. To us the points at issue\r\nseem of slight significance, while the results appear almost negligible\r\nin comparison with the energy and heat expended to produce them.\r\nWhichever view, if either, is correct, there can be no doubt of the\r\ngreat part played by this episode, for though in the end the contending\r\nparties were left very much where they started the casual results of\r\nthe struggle influenced the history of the country most powerfully, so\r\nthat in this controversy the incidents are of greater importance than\r\nthe main matter of contention.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to be wise after the event, and Henry is constantly blamed by\r\nmodern writers for having promoted Becket to the primacy and not having\r\nforeseen the consequences. Yet little reflection is required to show\r\nthat nothing short of the gift of prophecy would have enabled Henry to\r\nforesee the position which Thomas was to take up. The chancellor had\r\nhabitually neglected his duties as Archdeacon of Canterbury, calling\r\ndown upon himself the rebukes of Archbishop Theobald, and had on several\r\noccasions shown very slight regard for the privileges of the Church. At\r\nthe time of his appointment Gilbert Foliot scoffingly remarked that the\r\nking had performed a miracle, for he had converted a knightly courtier\r\ninto a holy archbishop. Events proved Foliot’s jest a truth, and though\r\nit was Becket who wrought the marvellous metamorphosis himself, it\r\nremained a miracle unforeshadowed in the past life or character of the\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThomas, who was born on 21st December 1118, was the son of Gilbert\r\nBecket by Maud his wife. His parents, who were both of Norman\r\nextraction[21] but had settled in London before his birth, belonged to\r\nthe middle class and were comfortably off, and by them he was sent to\r\nthe school of the canons of Merton Priory. While he was still quite\r\nyoung his mother died, and not long afterwards his father, who was in\r\nvery reduced circumstances owing to losses by fire, followed her.\r\nFortunately for himself Thomas, who was a good-looking boy of much\r\npromise, had attracted the attention of a powerful baron, Richer of\r\nL’Aigle, who had been in the habit of putting up at the Beckets’ house\r\nwhenever he came up to London. Richer interested himself in the orphan,\r\nsending him to school in London and allowing him to spend his holidays\r\nwith him in the country, presumably at his Sussex castle of Pevensey.\r\nHere Thomas practised hunting, hawking, and other manly sports, on one\r\noccasion nearly losing his life in the endeavour to rescue his falcon\r\nfrom a mill-stream. His patron appears to have sent him to study in\r\nParis, and on his return he entered the service of his kinsman, Osbern\r\nHuitdeniers, one of the leading citizens of London. After some three\r\nyears of official life in the city he determined to try a field more\r\npromising for his ambitions. Once again his father’s hospitality proved\r\nthe means of his advancement, two of Gilbert’s former guests, the\r\nArchdeacon Baldwin and his brother, Master Eustace, introducing him to\r\nthe notice of Archbishop Theobald. The archbishop, finding that the\r\nyoung man’s father had come from his own native town of Thierceville,\r\ngladly enrolled him in his household and took a kindly interest in him.\r\nThere were at this time at the archbishop’s court many men of\r\ndistinction and learning, and one of these, Roger of Pont l’Evêque,\r\nafterwards Archbishop of York, jealous of the favour shown to Thomas,\r\nwhose powers lay in the direction of showy brilliance rather than sound\r\nscholarship, did all that he could to injure and annoy him. Twice Roger\r\npersuaded the archbishop to dismiss the young man, but on each occasion\r\nTheobald’s brother, Walter, Archdeacon of Canterbury, took up his cause\r\nand secured his restoration to favour. As early as 1143, when he was in\r\nhis twenty-fifth year, Thomas rendered his patron good service at the\r\npapal court in the matter of annulling the legatine commission formerly\r\ngranted to Bishop Henry of Winchester. About this date he appears to\r\nhave attended the famous law schools at Bologna, and afterwards at\r\nAuxerre. By this time he was beginning to become a person of importance;\r\nthe churches of St. Mary-le-Strand and Otford, and prebends in St.\r\nPaul’s and Lincoln had been bestowed upon him, and in March 1148 he,\r\nwith his rival, Roger of Pont-l’Evêque, attended the archbishop on his\r\nventuresome sail across the Channel to the Council of Rheims. Three\r\nyears later, in 1151, Becket achieved a further diplomatic success in\r\ndefeating Stephen’s efforts to obtain papal recognition for his son\r\nEustace, and in 1154, when Roger of Pont-l’Evêque became Archbishop of\r\nYork, Thomas succeeded him as Archdeacon of Canterbury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEAL OF ROGER, ARCHBISHOP OF YORK (1/1)]\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Henry II., as we have seen, Thomas was made\r\nchancellor by the advice of Archbishop Theobald, with the generous\r\nsupport of Bishop Henry of Winchester, whose claims he had once been\r\ninstrumental in defeating. Of the splendour and luxury displayed in his\r\nhousehold as chancellor something has already been said. The means to\r\nsatisfy his taste for magnificence and display were furnished not only\r\nby the emoluments, regular and irregular,[22] of his office, but by\r\nmultitudinous extra preferments bestowed upon him, such as the\r\nprovostship of Beverley, the custody of the Tower of London, which he\r\nrestored and strengthened, and the honours of Eye and Berkhamstead. He\r\nstill retained his youthful love of sport and also displayed\r\nconsiderable military ability; during the expedition to Toulouse he was\r\nleft in command at Cahors, and justified his appointment by leading his\r\ntroops in person to the capture of three other castles, while somewhat\r\nlater he overthrew a French knight in single combat. The king could\r\nappreciate a man of spirit and a good sportsman, and the two men became\r\nfast friends. Henry, on his way to or from the hunt, would often drop in\r\nat the chancellor’s house and take a glass of wine with him, or,\r\nvaulting the table, sit down and eat, noting with amusement the luxury\r\nfor which his friend was so famous. The story is well known how, as\r\nking and chancellor were riding together through the streets of London\r\none bitter winter’s day, they saw a poor old man clad in rags. Turning\r\nto his friend the king said, “Would it not be a meritorious act to give\r\nthat poor old man a warm cloak?” The chancellor agreeing that it would\r\nindeed, Henry exclaimed, “You shall have the merit of this worthy act!”\r\nand seizing Becket’s magnificent fur-lined cloak, after a short struggle\r\nsecured it and flung it to the beggar.\r\n\r\nThe intimate friend of the king, a courtier, sportsman, and warrior,\r\nwhose only interest in the Church seemed to be to draw the revenues of\r\nhis many benefices and to extract money from its prelates for his royal\r\nmaster, no one could have foreseen Becket’s conversion into the most\r\nultra-clerical of archbishops.\r\n\r\nAlmost the first act of the newly consecrated archbishop was to resign\r\nthe chancellorship. As Becket must have been fully aware that the king\r\nexpected him to continue in office and would never have bestowed the\r\nprimacy upon him if he had declared his intention of resigning, his\r\naction was surprising and unjustifiable. Henry, though deeply annoyed,\r\naccepted the situation and displayed no ill-feeling towards Thomas. In\r\nfact when he landed at Southampton in January 1163, having been detained\r\nat Cherbourg over Christmas by bad weather, he greeted the archbishop\r\nwith all the warmth of affection which he had formerly bestowed upon the\r\nchancellor. These good relations continued for some months, Thomas\r\nsupporting the king’s request to the pope for the translation of Gilbert\r\nFoliot from Hereford to the vacant see of London,[23] and Henry visiting\r\nthe archbishop at Canterbury on his way down to Dover to meet the Count\r\nof Flanders in March. But Becket was now throwing himself with his usual\r\nthoroughness into the work appropriate to his position as head of the\r\nEnglish Church. His taste for display continued unabated, but found new\r\noutlets. As archbishop he was the recognised patron of the younger sons\r\nof nobles as the king was of their elder sons, while amongst the crowd\r\nof high-born youths serving as his esquires was the heir to the throne;\r\nhis household was as magnificent and his table as well-appointed as\r\never, but the clerks, who had formerly received little consideration,\r\nhad now supplanted the knights in the place of honour, while a somewhat\r\nostentatious prominence was given to the daily distribution of alms and\r\nfeeding of large numbers of poor persons. Thomas himself presided\r\ngracefully over the splendid feasts, and, though far from practising the\r\nstern asceticism of Gilbert Foliot, observed a strict moderation\r\nsuitable to the monastic habit which he had assumed; and although there\r\nwas no lack of gaiety and animation at his table the jesters and\r\nminstrels of former days were now replaced by readers of the Holy\r\nScripture.\r\n\r\nSoon the erstwhile pluralist chancellor began to attack the bestowal of\r\nmultiple benefices upon the king’s clerks, laymen in all but name, whose\r\nsole connection with their benefices was to draw their revenues. So long\r\nas Becket confined himself to this legitimate course of reform the king\r\nraised no objections, only insisting that the physician should first\r\nheal himself by surrendering the archdeaconry of Canterbury, which he\r\nhad most inconsistently retained with the archbishopric. But soon Thomas\r\npassed from correcting the faults of his clergy to protecting their\r\nvices. The complaints of the laity against the extortions and injustice\r\nof the archdeacons and their officials had been brought to Henry’s\r\nnotice in the time of Archbishop Theobald, and one particular case\r\nreported from Scarborough roused the king to declare that these clerical\r\nofficers wrung more money from the people every year than the revenues\r\nof the crown. Had not matters of importance obliged Henry to leave\r\nEngland just at this time it is not improbable that he would have\r\ncarried out, with the assistance of Thomas the Chancellor, some of those\r\nmeasures for the control of the clerical courts which Thomas the\r\nArchbishop devoted his life to opposing. The bishops ordained candidates\r\nwithout regard to their fitness, and, contrary to the canons, bestowed\r\norders upon men who had no title. Inevitably the country was overrun\r\nwith men of low character, without definite means of subsistence, who\r\ncould laugh alike at the lay courts, which had no jurisdiction over\r\nthem, and at the ecclesiastical courts, whose proceedings were only too\r\noften a farce; for the clerk who held no church deprivation had no\r\nterrors, and it was well known that the bishops would rather a guilty\r\nclerk were acquitted than that they should be burdened with the cost of\r\nhis keep in the episcopal prisons. Murders and other crimes were\r\ncommitted by these bastard sons of the Church, and any attempt to bring\r\nthe offenders to book was foiled by the prelates. Becket, who as\r\nchancellor had imprisoned a clerk in the Tower for seduction, now threw\r\nthe mantle of the Church over an unworthy clerk who had been guilty of a\r\npeculiarly atrocious murder and adultery. The king felt strongly in the\r\nmatter, but it would seem that for a time his old affection kept him\r\nfrom pressing his anti-clerical measures to the point of an actual\r\nbreach with the archbishop. Other matters, however, more personal, now\r\narose to increase the estrangement between the former friends.\r\n\r\nOn his return from the Welsh expedition in July 1163, Henry appears to\r\nhave found his affairs rather involved and to have proposed to increase\r\nhis revenue by appropriating the annual payment known as the “Sheriff’s\r\naid”; the exact points in dispute are obscure and will be discussed in a\r\nlater chapter, but it is known that the king swore “by the eyes of\r\nGod”[24] that the payment should be made part of the Crown revenues and\r\nthat the archbishop vowed “by his reverence for those same eyes” that no\r\npenny of it should be paid from his lands while he lived. In the end\r\nHenry had to give way, and he was again defeated by Becket about the\r\nsame time in another matter still nearer to his heart. During the\r\nretreat from Toulouse in 1159 King Stephen’s son, William, Count of\r\nBoulogne, and, in right of his wife, Earl of Surrey and Warenne, had\r\ndied, leaving no children. To prevent the county of Boulogne falling\r\ninto the hands of any adherent of the King of France, Henry took\r\nWilliam’s sister, Mary, out of the nunnery of Romsey, where she was\r\nabbess, and married her to Matthew, son of the Count of Flanders, in\r\nspite of Becket’s very proper protests. Earl William’s widow, Isabel de\r\nWarenne, being still unmarried, the king decided that her heritage would\r\nform a suitable provision for his brother William, for whom he had once\r\nproposed to conquer Ireland. He therefore began to push the marriage\r\nforward, but was stopped by the action of the archbishop, who forbade it\r\non the ground that the contracting parties were related within the\r\nprohibited degrees.[25] A papal dispensation had been available for the\r\nmarriage of Abbess Mary, but the opposition of Thomas the Archbishop\r\nproved so much more potent than the protests of Thomas the Chancellor\r\nthat the projected marriage had to be abandoned. The young William took\r\nthe matter so much to heart that he retired to the court of his mother,\r\nthe empress, at Rouen, where he shortly afterwards sickened and died on\r\n30th January 1164.\r\n\r\nBecket had deprived the king’s clerks of their benefices, protected\r\ncriminals from the king’s justice, opposed the king’s financial schemes,\r\nand thwarted the king’s plans for his brother’s advance. He had also\r\naggressively asserted the rights of Canterbury against the Earl of Clare\r\nand others of the king’s barons and had excommunicated the king’s\r\ntenant, William of Eynesford, in a dispute over the advowson of a\r\nchurch, the decision of which was claimed as belonging to the king’s\r\ncourt. Even if he had been entirely in the right in every one of these\r\nquestions it would not have been extraordinary if the king, a violently\r\nself-willed man, had become completely estranged. And now the question\r\nof clerical immunities reached a climax. A long list of crimes committed\r\nby clerks was presented to the king by his justices, and one of these\r\njustices, Simon Fitz-Peter, made a special complaint against Philip de\r\nBroi, a canon of Bedford. The canon had been accused of the murder of a\r\nknight and had cleared himself by his oath before the Bishop of Lincoln,\r\nbut Simon Fitz-Peter, who was holding assizes at Dunstaple, apparently\r\nconsidering that the verdict of the ecclesiastical court was contrary to\r\nevidence, ordered him to stand his trial before himself; Philip\r\nrefused, and in course of argument used insulting expressions towards\r\nthe justice, which the latter reported to the king. Henry, enraged at\r\nthe insult to his representative, demanded that Philip should be retried\r\non both charges, of murder and contempt of court, before a lay tribunal.\r\nThis claim Becket successfully combated, and the king had to be content\r\nwith a trial before an ecclesiastical court. The prelates who formed the\r\ncourt decided that the question of the murder had been finally disposed\r\nof by the acquittal before the Bishop of Lincoln and could not be\r\nre-opened, but for the insult to the king’s officer they commanded that\r\nPhilip de Broi should forfeit his prebend and go into exile for two\r\nyears, and should also make a public apology to Simon Fitz-Peter clad in\r\npenitential garb. Henry declared that the sentence was absurdly light,\r\nand determined to bring the whole question of clerical and lay\r\njurisdiction to a definite issue.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity soon offered, and at a council held at Westminster in\r\nOctober 1163, Henry definitely demanded that the bishops should swear to\r\nobey the ancient customs of the realm, which, he claimed, allowed a\r\nclerk to be indicted before a lay tribunal, sent for trial to the\r\necclesiastical court, and, if found guilty, degraded and, being no\r\nlonger a clerk, sent back to the lay court to receive sentence. There\r\nwas no question of trying clerks before lay judges, but the bishops,\r\nheaded by Becket, took up the line that the Church’s sentence must of\r\nnecessity be just,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY II DISPUTING WITH BECKET\r\n\r\n(From Cott. M.S. Claud. Dii)]\r\n\r\nand that to inflict a further punishment after degradation would be to\r\npunish a man twice for one offence; they would therefore only consent to\r\nthe “ancient customs,” of which they denied the antiquity and legality,\r\n“saving the rights of their order,” or in other words reserving the\r\nliberty to interpret them as they pleased. The king at once broke up the\r\ncouncil, deprived Becket of the custody of the honours of Eye and\r\nBerkhamstead, and withdrew the young Prince Henry from his care. An\r\ninterview between the king and the archbishop outside Northampton did\r\nnot mend affairs, but by the advice of Arnulf, Bishop of Lisieux, Henry\r\nadopted the policy of detaching the bishops from Becket and gradually\r\nisolating him. Bishop Hilary of Chichester had from the first been\r\nwilling to accept the customs, and Gilbert Foliot of London, and Roger,\r\nArchbishop of York, lent their aid, more from dislike of the primate\r\nthan from approval of the king’s schemes. Finding himself almost\r\nunsupported the archbishop listened to the arguments of the papal\r\nnuncio, Philip, Abbot of Aumône, and Robert of Melun, Bishop-elect of\r\nHereford, and agreed to withdraw the obnoxious reservation and accept\r\nthe customs. Not content with the verbal promise thus made before him at\r\nOxford, Henry determined to have the acceptance of the customs formally\r\nand publicly ratified, and accordingly he summoned a great council to\r\nmeet at Clarendon in January 1164.\r\n\r\nAt this Council of Clarendon were present the peers, both spiritual and\r\nlay, in full force; the Earls of Cornwall, Leicester, Hertford, Essex\r\nand Chester, Arundel, Salisbury and Ferrers; the Counts of Brittany and\r\nEu; Richard de Lucy, the justiciar; Richer of l’Aigle, Becket’s old\r\npatron; Simon Fitz-Peter, the insulted justice, and the representatives\r\nof such great families as Bohun, Mowbray, Braose, Warenne, Cheyney,\r\nBeauchamp, and Dunstanville, all of whom gave their assent to the code\r\nof laws now presented on the king’s behalf as embodying the customs of\r\nthe realm concerning the Church prevalent in the time of his\r\ngrandfather, Henry I. The prelates had apparently expected that they\r\nwould be called upon to promise obedience to certain vague and undefined\r\n“ancient customs,” which could be subsequently eluded by denying that\r\nany particular regulation which infringed their privileges rightly\r\nbelonged to that category. When they heard the very definite and exact\r\nclaims advanced by the Crown they met the demand for their assent with\r\nan absolute and united refusal, as was indeed to be expected.\r\n\r\nThe details of these Constitutions of Clarendon will be discussed\r\nelsewhere, but the main points were, briefly, as follows. The claim,\r\nalready referred to, that clerks might be accused before a lay judge,\r\nand if condemned and degraded by the ecclesiastical court, the\r\nproceedings in which were to be watched by one of the king’s justices,\r\nmight be sentenced as laymen. That appeals might be made from the\r\nbishop’s court to that of the archbishop and from the latter to the\r\nking, without whose leave no appeal should be made to the Pope; to\r\nstrengthen this latter provision it was ordained that no ecclesiastic\r\nshould leave the kingdom without the royal licence. That no\r\ntenant-in-chief should be excommunicated or his lands interdicted\r\nwithout the king’s leave; that pleas touching advowsons should belong to\r\nthe king’s courts; and that the sons of villeins should not be ordained\r\nwithout the permission of their lords. Becket, as leader of the Church\r\nparty, rejected the customs completely. He reasserted the finality of\r\nsentences passed in ecclesiastical courts, and declared that the\r\nproposed sentencing of the condemned clerk by the lay court would be “to\r\nbring Christ before Pilate a second time.” The prohibition of papal\r\nappeals he denounced as contrary to the consecration oaths of the\r\nbishops, by which they were bound to allow such appeals, and the\r\nrestriction on the passage of the clergy across the seas he declared\r\nwould place them in a position of inferiority as compared with laymen\r\nand would discourage pious pilgrimages. Finally, on the whole question\r\nhe took up the uncompromising attitude that the Church was the giver of\r\nlaws and the ruler of kings, and that human laws which interfered with\r\nits privileges were of no effect.\r\n\r\nNegotiations were opened on the king’s behalf by the Bishops of Norwich\r\nand Salisbury, who pointed out to Becket the probable consequences for\r\nall the prelates of inflaming the king’s anger, which consequences they\r\nthemselves would be the first to feel, as they were out of favour with\r\nHenry. Their representations proving of no effect, the Earls of Cornwall\r\nand Leicester besought him to consider the difficult position in which\r\nthey and other peers, faithful sons of the Church, would be placed if\r\nthe king persisted in his demands to the point of ordering the arrest\r\nand trial of the archbishop. Finding him obdurate they withdrew, and the\r\nnext attempt at effecting a compromise was made by two knights of the\r\nOrder of the Temple, Richard de Hastings, the English Grand Master, and\r\nOtes de St. Omer. Combining in themselves the attributes of knights and\r\necclesiastics, they were well suited to act as arbitrators, and their\r\narguments appear to have had some effect; so that when at last the\r\nimpatient crowds of courtiers began to threaten and show signs of\r\nviolence, the wearied archbishop broke down under the strain and\r\ncondescended to an unworthy act of casuistry. Turning to his astonished\r\nfellow prelates he exclaimed, “If the king insists upon my perjuring\r\nmyself I must do so, and must hope to purge the sin by future penance.”\r\nProceeding to the king’s council chamber he declared his acceptance of\r\nthe customs, “honestly, in good faith and without deceit,” and at his\r\ncommand the bishops also signified their consent. Henry at once demanded\r\nthat Becket should swear to observe the customs, and should affix his\r\nseal to a written copy thereof. To the first demand Becket replied that\r\na priest’s word was as good as an oath, while the question of sealing\r\nhe managed to waive for the time being, accepting a copy of the customs\r\nby way of protest. Following up his victory, Henry caused both\r\narchbishops, of Canterbury and York, to write to the pope desiring him\r\nto confirm the customs. This they did, to please the king, knowing well\r\nthat the pope would refuse to sanction any such infringement of the\r\nChurch’s privileges. At the same time Henry desired the pope to appoint\r\nthe Archbishop of York legate for all England. Alexander, while refusing\r\nto confirm the customs, granted the legation to Archbishop Roger, but by\r\nexempting Becket and the church of Canterbury deprived the grant of its\r\npoint. Henry indignantly returned the letters of legation and refused a\r\nfurther offer of the legation for himself.\r\n\r\nBecket left Clarendon deeply humiliated at his own weakness, and even\r\nwent so far as to suspend himself from the performance of divine service\r\nfor a time. A letter to the pope explaining and lamenting his action\r\nreceived a sympathetic reply virtually absolving him from the promise\r\nwhich he had made but had never intended to keep. Not content with this,\r\nhowever, he determined to visit the papal court, at this time\r\nestablished at Sens, in person, and actually set sail from Romney with\r\nthat intention, but was foiled in his attempt to cross the Channel by\r\ncontrary winds, coupled with the boatmen’s fear of incurring the king’s\r\nanger. This infringement of one of the articles of the Clarendon\r\nConstitutions was reported to Henry, and served to embitter him yet\r\nmore against Becket and to precipitate the crisis which now arose. One\r\nof the king’s officers, John the Marshal, having brought an action in\r\nthe archbishop’s court touching an estate held of the manor of Pagham in\r\nSussex, being defeated in his claim availed himself of the section in\r\nthe Constitutions which permitted an appeal to the king, and made such\r\nan appeal, taking oath that justice had not been done to him. The\r\narchbishop was accordingly ordered to attend and answer the plea at\r\nWestminster on 14th September 1164. On that day Becket was unwell, and\r\nsent four knights with letters from himself and from the sheriff of Kent\r\ntestifying that he was ill, and alleging that John’s case ought to be\r\nset aside as he had deceitfully sworn upon a tropiary, or hymn-book,\r\ninstead of upon the Gospels. The king vowed that Becket’s plea of\r\nillness was false, stormed at the knights, refused to listen to them,\r\nand named a fresh day, 6th October, for hearing the suit at Northampton.\r\nBy this time the breach between the once inseparable friends had so\r\nwidened that the king would not send even formal documents direct to the\r\narchbishop, as to do so would involve addressing him with a polite\r\nformula of salutation which was very far from expressing his real\r\nfeelings. For the council to be held at Northampton, therefore, Becket,\r\ninstead of receiving the personal summons due to his rank, was summoned\r\nthrough the sheriff, and when he greeted the king at Northampton he was\r\nrefused the kiss of welcome.\r\n\r\nJohn the Marshal was absent on the king’s business at the Exchequer on\r\nthe first day of the council, but next day he duly appeared in court,\r\nand Becket was ready to answer him. Henry, however, swept aside Becket’s\r\narguments and pleadings, accused him of contempt of court for not having\r\nappeared in person on the previous occasion, and demanded sentence\r\nagainst him. The court, fearing the king and considering that Becket had\r\nbeen guilty of contempt, condemned him to be “at the king’s mercy.”\r\nTheoretically this meant that he forfeited all his chattels to the king,\r\nbut in practice the forfeiture was commutable for a fixed sum, which\r\nvaried in different parts of the country: for a citizen of London the\r\nfine was a hundred shillings, for a man of the privileged county of Kent\r\nonly forty shillings. In this case, however, the court arbitrarily\r\ndeparted from the established custom and pronounced sentence of complete\r\nforfeiture. To decide on the verdict was one thing, to pronounce\r\nsentence against the head of the English Church was another; the barons\r\ndeclined to do so, and said it was clearly a task for the spiritual\r\npeers; the latter retorted that they could not be expected to sentence\r\ntheir own head; but finally by the king’s order sentence was pronounced\r\nby the aged Bishop Henry of Winchester, a thorough supporter of Becket’s\r\necclesiastical policy. Hardly had this been done when Henry demanded of\r\nthe archbishop an account of three hundred pounds owing for the honours\r\nof Eye and Berkhamstead which he had held of the king’s grant. Thomas\r\nvery rightly replied that he had had no notice of any such demand, and\r\nfurther stated that he had laid out the whole amount, and more, in\r\nbuilding operations on the king’s behalf. So far as Berkhamstead is\r\nconcerned, the Pipe Rolls seem to show that all arrears due to the king\r\nhad been paid the previous year; but as the honour of Eye was not\r\naccounted for while Becket held it as chancellor, it is possible that\r\nthere might have been some foundation for the claim, though nothing\r\ncould justify the way in which it was advanced. Whatever the rights of\r\nthe case the verdict was, of course, against Becket, and when he\r\nprotested against the indignity of being called upon to find sureties\r\nfor payment he was told that his goods having been declared forfeit he\r\nwas no longer a man of substance. Accordingly, the Archdeacon of\r\nCanterbury became his surety for one hundred pounds, and the Earl of\r\nGloucester, the Count of Eu, and William of Eynesford for one hundred\r\nmarks apiece.[26]\r\n\r\nNext day Henry renewed his attack upon the same lines, demanding back\r\nfive hundred marks which he had lent Thomas as chancellor at the time of\r\nthe Toulouse expedition, and calling for an account of all the issues of\r\nvacant sees and abbeys which had been in his custody during the period\r\nof his chancellorship. The king’s intention of breaking the archbishop\r\nby fair means or foul was now so clear that the time-serving lords who\r\nhad till lately been proud to pay court to Becket now avoided him; his\r\nold friend and supporter the Bishop of Winchester advised him to resign\r\nhis see, and Hilary of Chichester urged the same course, which other\r\ncounsellors as strongly discountenanced. Worn out by the strain, Becket\r\nfell ill and was unable to appear in court on the sixth day, Monday,\r\n12th October; Henry again disbelieved his excuse, and sent a number of\r\nbarons to see him and report. Thomas undertook to come next morning even\r\nif he had to be carried in a litter. He now determined to bring matters\r\nto a crisis and prepared to face the worst. His preparations were\r\nsignificant, if somewhat theatrical. Early in the morning he went into\r\nthe chapel of St. Andrew’s Priory, where he was lodging, and going to\r\nthe altar of St. Stephen celebrated the mass of the proto-martyr. After\r\nthis his intention had been to proceed to the court in full canonicals,\r\nbarefooted and carrying his own cross; from such an ostentatious\r\ndefiance to the king to do his worst his friends managed to dissuade\r\nhim, and he rode in the usual way to the castle. But when he had\r\ndismounted at the entrance to the hall he took the processional cross\r\nfrom the hands of Alexander Llewellyn, his Welsh cross-bearer, and\r\ninsisted upon carrying it himself. Such a plain challenge to the king,\r\nsignifying his appeal to the protection of the Cross from the royal\r\ninjustice and violence, horrified his followers. The Archdeacon of\r\nLisieux besought the Bishop of London to prevent it; Foliot replied, “My\r\ngood friend, he always was a fool and always will be!” Nevertheless he\r\nattempted to dissuade the archbishop from his fatal course, claiming the\r\nright to carry the cross himself, as Dean of Canterbury, and even\r\nendeavouring to wrest it from Becket by force. Finding his efforts of no\r\navail he desisted, contenting himself with the remark that if the king\r\nnow drew his sword they would make a fine pair. Becket then entered and\r\nseated himself apart, holding his cross and attended by Herbert of\r\nBosham and William Fitz-Stephen. Meanwhile the bishops had been called\r\nin to speak with the king, and Becket’s old enemy, Roger, Archbishop of\r\nYork, had availed himself of the opportunity to insult his fallen rival\r\nby having his archiepiscopal cross carried before him, a deliberate\r\ninfringement of the privileges of the see of Canterbury, within whose\r\nprovince Northampton lay.[27] While the course that events would take\r\nwas still uncertain, Becket’s attendants were giving him very\r\ncontradictory advice: Herbert of Bosham, the fiery theologian,\r\ncounselled him to hurl the thunders of excommunication against his\r\nenemies if they dared to offer violence to his person, but the cautious\r\nand level-headed lawyer, William Fitz-Stephen, deprecated such a course\r\nand urged him to imitate the saints of old and suffer wrong with\r\nmeekness and patience.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop having inhibited the bishops from sitting in judgment\r\nupon him for any plea touching matters prior to his consecration, and\r\nhaving also appealed to Rome against the excessive and unprecedented\r\nsentence of forfeiture, Gilbert Foliot at once lodged a counter appeal\r\nand Bishop Hilary of Chichester protested against Becket’s breach of the\r\nConstitutions, which he, and at his suggestion all the bishops, had so\r\nrecently promised on their priestly word to obey “honestly, in good\r\nfaith and without deceit.” Becket’s defence was to the effect that the\r\nvery qualifying words which Hilary quoted justified his action, for\r\nnothing could be observed in good faith that was contrary to the\r\nChristian faith, or honestly which was against the Church’s honour;\r\nadding that if they had shown weakness at Clarendon it was the more\r\nnecessary that they should be strong now. Finding all hope of compromise\r\ngone, the king sent the Earl of Leicester to pronounce sentence upon the\r\narchbishop. The sentence would most probably have involved imprisonment,\r\nbut it was never pronounced, for Becket indignantly ordered the earl to\r\ndesist from uttering sentence against his spiritual father, further\r\ndeclaring with justice that he had been summoned to answer only in the\r\ncase of John the Marshal and could not be called upon to account for\r\nall his doings as chancellor without summons, especially as at the time\r\nof his consecration the king’s ministers had expressly undertaken that\r\nhe should not be called to account for any of his acts as chancellor.\r\n\r\nThe earl retired abashed, and after a decent interval Becket rose and,\r\nstill carrying his cross, left the hall. As he went he stumbled against\r\na faggot, and Randulf de Broc cried out that he stumbled like the\r\ntraitor that he was. The taunt of traitor was taken up and repeated in\r\nparticular by Hamelin, the king’s illegitimate brother, now Earl of\r\nSurrey and Warenne by his marriage with the Countess Isabel. Turning\r\nangrily on the earl, Becket exclaimed, “If it were not for my cloth I\r\nwould show you whether I am a traitor or not!” The clamour reached the\r\nking’s ears, and he at once sent a messenger to proclaim that no one was\r\nto insult or molest the archbishop. He accordingly reached his quarters\r\nat St. Andrew’s safely, and while seated at supper meditating upon his\r\nfurther course of action he received an omen which confirmed the\r\nintention, already half formed in his mind, of flight, for in the\r\nevening lection occurred the passage, “If men persecute you in one city,\r\nflee unto another.” As he heard this phrase read out, Thomas looked\r\nacross significantly at Herbert of Bosham, and as soon as he had an\r\nopportunity of speaking to him in private he bade him hasten to\r\nCanterbury, obtain as much money as possible from the archiepiscopal\r\nestates, and then cross to the monastery of St. Bertin at St. Omer and\r\nawait his coming. Then he expressed his intention of keeping vigil\r\nthroughout the night in the church, refusing the proffered company of\r\nthe monks; and a little before daybreak he stole away in disguise under\r\nthe guidance of a canon of Sempringham, with only two other companions.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry heard next morning of the archbishop’s flight he sent orders\r\nto Dover and other ports to prevent his crossing, and then turned with\r\nsome relief to the business of the approaching expedition against the\r\nWelsh. Meanwhile Thomas, knowing that search would be made for him in\r\nKent, had turned north, reaching Grantham on the first day, and then on\r\nto Lincoln, where he stayed at the house of a fuller. From Lincoln he\r\nwent by water to Sempringham Priory and so to Boston. Probably finding\r\nthat that port was watched, he turned south, and after visiting\r\nHaverholme proceeded by unfrequented paths into Kent, travelling chiefly\r\nat night, and for a week lay hidden at Eastry, until on the evening of\r\n2nd November circumstances enabled him to set sail. After a rough voyage\r\nhe landed in Flanders near Gravelines; but he was not yet in safety, for\r\nHenry, whose embassy to the papal court had just crossed the Channel,\r\nhad warned the Count of Flanders of the possibility of Becket’s landing\r\nin his territory, and the count bore the archbishop ill-will for the\r\nopposition which he had offered to the marriage of the Abbess Mary of\r\nBoulogne to the count’s brother. Worn out by the hardships of the sea\r\nvoyage Thomas found himself unable to walk, and the only means of\r\nconveyance obtainable proved to be a pack-horse. Laying their garments\r\nin place of the lacking saddle his companions lifted the weary\r\narchbishop on to the horse, and in this humble guise he, whose gorgeous\r\ncavalcade had once been a nine days’ wonder, entered Gravelines. Yet,\r\nthough in poor dress, treated by his companions with a careful absence\r\nof ceremony and passing as “Brother Christian,” there were little\r\ndistinctions between him and his friends which nothing could efface, and\r\nwhich did not escape the notice of the innkeeper at whose house he put\r\nup. The man and his servant, who also recognised the archbishop, proved\r\nhonest, and Thomas safely accomplished the remainder of his journey to\r\nSt. Omer. Here he met not only his faithful Herbert of Bosham but also\r\nthe justiciar, Richard de Luci. The justiciar having vainly endeavoured\r\nto persuade Becket to return to England, promising him his own good\r\nservices with the king, formally renounced all allegiance to him and\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nTo follow the course of the struggle between king and archbishop during\r\nthe six years of Becket’s exile in detail is a wearisome and\r\nunprofitable task. Constant efforts at mediation, incessant appeals and\r\ncounter-appeals to Rome, broadcast excommunications involving the most\r\nprominent men at Henry’s court and all who had dealings with them, till\r\nhardly a person of eminence stood outside the Church’s ban, mutual\r\nrecriminations, and anything and everything except reason and\r\ncompromise. The king’s absolute insistence upon the Constitutions of\r\nClarendon was met by Becket with a blank refusal. So far as we can judge\r\nHenry might have been persuaded to accept a compromise had the\r\narchbishop shown the least inclination to meet him half-way, and such a\r\ncourse would certainly have had powerful support from the wiser and more\r\ntemperate royal officers. As it was, it is remarkable that, while a\r\nconsiderable number of prominent ecclesiastics were in opposition to\r\nBecket, he does not seem to have had the support of a single English or\r\nNorman layman of any eminence.\r\n\r\nHenry, in a moment of anger at Becket’s flight, had sent an imperious\r\nletter to King Louis demanding the return of Thomas, “late Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury”; Louis inquired, with some justice, who had deposed the\r\narchbishop, adding that he in his kingdom could not displace the meanest\r\nclerk; the request for the return of Thomas he refused, going out of his\r\nway to offer the fugitive cordial hospitality. Henry’s embassy to the\r\npope at Sens, consisting of the Archbishop of York, the Bishops of\r\nChichester, London, and Worcester, the Earl of Arundel and others, met\r\nwith equal unsuccess. The archbishop and the Bishops of London and\r\nChichester all spoke with great vehemence against Becket, but the papal\r\ncourt was more amused at certain slips of accent and construction in\r\ntheir Latin than convinced by their argument, and it was only the calm\r\nand reasoned speech of the Earl of Arundel, who spoke in his native\r\nFrench, that produced any impression. The pope refused to do anything\r\nuntil Becket had come to state his own case, and the embassy, having\r\nstrict orders to return at once, withdrew. Thomas on his arrival\r\nproduced his copy of the Constitutions, which the pope had not\r\npreviously seen. They were, naturally, declared to be intolerable\r\ninfringements of the rights of the Church and St. Peter, and the pope\r\nsternly rebuked Thomas for ever having given his consent to them. At\r\nthis time, apparently, Becket surrendered the primacy into the pope’s\r\nhands, receiving it back again from him. By so doing he was not only\r\nconfirmed in full possession of the see but was in the position to deny\r\nthat he owed his archbishopric to the king. Pope Alexander was now very\r\nawkwardly placed, for while his position as head of the Church compelled\r\nhim to uphold Becket, his recognition as pope had been largely due to\r\nHenry’s support, and if that support were withdrawn and given to the\r\nschismatic antipope, Alexander’s hold on the papacy would be dangerously\r\nweakened. The reality of this danger was soon made clear, when, in May\r\n1165, Henry’s ambassadors, Richard of Ilchester, Archdeacon of\r\nPoictiers, and John of Oxford, who were present at the Emperor\r\nFrederic’s council at Wurzburg nominally on business touching the\r\nproposed marriage of Henry’s daughter Maud, virtually pledged their\r\nroyal master to support the emperor and the antipope against Alexander.\r\nFeeling, however, ran too strongly against Henry in this matter, and he\r\nhad to repudiate the action of his ambassadors.\r\n\r\nThe pope, cautiously avoiding a complete breach with Henry, declared\r\nthat certain of the Constitutions were quite inadmissible but that\r\nothers were tolerable, and, by refraining from any definite\r\npronouncement as to any particular sections, left an opening for\r\nnegotiations. At the same time he attempted to bring the king to reason\r\nthrough the mediation of the Bishops of London and Hereford, Archbishop\r\nRotrou of Rouen, and the Empress Maud. But matters had already gone too\r\nfar for any friendly arrangement to be possible. Becket, who after his\r\ninterview with the pope had established himself, in December 1164, at\r\nthe Cistercian abbey of Pontigny, was determined to yield nothing, and\r\nhad already commenced the campaign of letters, argumentative, mandatory,\r\nsupplicatory and threatening, with which he disturbed the peace of\r\nWestern Europe for the next five years; and Henry, at his Christmas\r\ncouncil at Marlborough, had retorted by confiscating the property of the\r\nsee of Canterbury. Not content with this legitimate seizure of the\r\narchbishop’s revenues, the king extended his attack to all persons\r\nconnected with Becket by family or official ties, and all his poor\r\nrelations and such of his clerks as had proved themselves faithful to\r\nhis cause were stripped of their possessions and sent into exile under\r\na vow to join their patron. This step, designed to worry Becket and to\r\nstrain his already straitened finances, seems to have owed its full\r\nrigour if not its inception to Ranulf de Broc, into whose hands the\r\nproperty of the see had been committed, and was opposed by Bishop Hilary\r\nof Chichester on the ground that, while so manifestly unjust an act\r\nwould put the king in the wrong, the chief effect would be to strengthen\r\nBecket by surrounding him with a crowd of faithful servants.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1165 little worthy of note occurred, but with the spring\r\nof 1166 Becket began to adopt more vigorous measures. Assured in his own\r\nmind of the support of the pope, who on 24th April appointed the\r\narchbishop Legate of England, Thomas wrote three successive letters to\r\nKing Henry, couched in language of increasing severity, warning and\r\nthreatening him. The king, who was at Chinon, could only tie Becket’s\r\nhands by an appeal to Rome against his threatened action, and\r\naccordingly sent the Bishops of Séez and Lisieux to Pontigny to give\r\nnotice of his appeal. On their arrival at Pontigny on Ascension Day, 2nd\r\nJune, they found that Thomas had gone to Soissons to visit the shrine of\r\nSt. Drausius, a favourite resort of persons about to fight a judicial\r\nduel. Invigorated by his visit to the combative saint, Becket went on to\r\nthe abbey of Vézelay, and on Whitsunday, 22nd June, to the astonishment\r\nand dismay of his unsuspecting companions, publicly excommunicated\r\nRichard de Luci and Joscelin de Bailliol as authors of the Clarendon\r\nConstitutions, Richard of Ilchester and John of Oxford for taking part\r\nwith the schismatics at Wurzburg, John of Oxford being further condemned\r\nfor accepting the Deanery of Salisbury in spite of prohibition, and\r\nRandulf de Broc and others for usurping the possessions of the church of\r\nCanterbury, while the king himself was threatened with a similar fate.\r\nThe sentences created little excitement outside the circle of Becket’s\r\nown audience; most of those against whom they were fulminated were\r\nbecoming seasoned to excommunication, and the king was sustained by the\r\ncomfortable knowledge that the pope would support him. In the previous\r\nMay Henry had given orders for a levy throughout his dominions on behalf\r\nof the Crusade, and some months earlier he had shown further evidence of\r\nhis zeal for the Church by presiding at Oxford over a council which\r\ncondemned a little band of German or Flemish heretics who had settled in\r\nEngland. These heretics, humble weavers under the leadership of one\r\nGerard, seem to have held opinions similar to those of the Waldensian\r\nProtestants; they met with little or no success in their missionary\r\nefforts, and, having refused to recant, were branded and scourged and\r\nturned out into the snow, to perish of cold and hunger. Fortified with\r\nthe knowledge of his good services to the Church, Henry did not even\r\nhesitate to appoint the excommunicate John of Oxford as envoy, with John\r\nCumin and Ralph of Tamworth, to the papal court. On their arrival Pope\r\nAlexander gave them a friendly welcome, absolved John of Oxford and\r\nconfirmed him in possession of the Deanery of Salisbury, quashed\r\nBecket’s sentences and ordered him to refrain from molesting the king,\r\nat the same time promising to appoint commissioners to arbitrate between\r\nthe king and the archbishop.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the year 1166 Henry had been successful in procuring\r\nBecket’s removal from Pontigny by threats against the Cistercian order.\r\nHis star was distinctly in the ascendant, and he could afford to await\r\nwith equanimity the long-delayed arrival of the papal commissioners, the\r\ncardinals Otto and William of Pavia. Becket, on the other hand, was\r\nangered by the pope’s action and especially by the appointment of\r\nCardinal William, and expressed himself with a vehemence which even his\r\nfriend John of Salisbury considered excessive. The enormous mass of\r\ncorrespondence concerned with the Becket controversy which has been\r\npreserved is throughout remarkable rather for vigour than elegance. In\r\nletters which are a mosaic of quotations and reminiscences from the\r\nVulgate, with an occasional phrase from a classical poet, the writer’s\r\nadversaries are compared to the most notorious villains of Scripture,\r\nwhile contempt is poured on them by means of sarcastic puns, Richard de\r\nLuci, the great justiciar, becoming “Luscus”--the one-eyed or\r\nhalf-blind--and the Archdeacon of Canterbury figuring as the\r\n“archdemon.” The whole correspondence breathes a spirit of intolerance\r\nwhich augured ill for the efforts of would-be mediators. Of these\r\nmediators the one of whom most might have been hoped, Henry’s mother,\r\nthe Empress Maud, died at Rouen on 10th September 1167. As a devoted\r\ndaughter of the Church she had condemned the excessive severity of her\r\nson’s anti-clerical legislation, though as “a daughter of tyrants” she\r\nhad approved the general trend of the Clarendon Constitutions. Her\r\ninfluence with Henry was great, and if compromise had been possible it\r\nwould no doubt have been exerted to that end, but, as it was, she could\r\ndo nothing beyond such moderating measures as interfering on behalf of\r\nan imprisoned and tortured bearer of papal letters.\r\n\r\nWhen the papal legates at last opened negotiations in November 1167, by\r\nan interview with the archbishop at Planches on the borders of France\r\nand Normandy, they found him resolute to agree to nothing without the\r\naddition of the disputed phrase “saving the liberty of the Church,” and\r\nall their arguments were useless. When they made their report to Henry\r\nhe dismissed them angrily with some uncomplimentary remarks on the\r\nsubject of cardinals. A renewed appeal by the English bishops tied\r\nBecket’s hands till November 1168, and in May of that year the pope\r\nremonstrated with him and ordered him to take no action against the king\r\nuntil the beginning of Lent, 5th March 1169. At the same time Alexander\r\nmade an effort to bring matters to a settlement by appointing two monks,\r\nthe Prior of Mont Dieu and Simon de Coudre of Grammont, as\r\ncommissioners. They did not act until 7th January 1169, when Henry and\r\nLouis met at Montmirail to negotiate a treaty. Becket was with the\r\nFrench king, and when the commissioners had presented to Henry a letter\r\nfrom the pope urging him to a speedy reconciliation, the archbishop came\r\nforward with every appearance of humility and expressed his desire for\r\npeace. Henry was willing to receive him back into favour if he would\r\nundertake to act loyally, but Becket would only pledge himself to\r\nobedience “saving the honour of God,” or in other words “the liberty of\r\nthe Church.” In vain Henry offered him every right and possession that\r\nhis predecessors in the see of Canterbury had held, provided that he\r\nwould obey the laws that they, many of them saints, had obeyed. A\r\nsuggestion that Thomas should return to his post without any definite\r\nmention being made of the Constitutions, with a tacit understanding that\r\nthe more objectionable sections should be modified, was also rejected,\r\nand the conference broke up.\r\n\r\nShortly after this the commissioners presented to Henry letters from the\r\npope couched in stern language and warning him of the consequences if he\r\ndid not soon come to terms with Becket. Nevertheless Alexander was not\r\nprepared to take extreme measures, and accordingly he appointed yet\r\nother mediators, the Cardinals Gratian and Vivian, and wrote to Becket\r\nordering him to take no action against the king or his supporters until\r\nthey had performed their mission. Before this order reached the\r\narchbishop at Sens, where he had fixed his headquarters since his\r\nexpulsion from Pontigny, he had availed himself of the expiration of the\r\nterm of inaction previously set him, and early in March excommunicated\r\nthe Bishop of Salisbury, Earl Hugh of Norfolk, and other offenders,\r\nlaymen and clerks, following this up on Palm Sunday, 13th April, with\r\nthe excommunication of the Bishop of London and the announcement of a\r\nsimilar fate in store for Geoffrey Ridel, archdeacon of Canterbury,\r\nRichard of Ilchester, Richard de Luci, and others. Anticipating his\r\naction the two bishops had already made provisional appeals to the pope,\r\nwhile precautions were taken to prevent the delivery of the notice of\r\nexcommunication. But on Ascension Day, 29th May, during the celebration\r\nof mass in St. Paul’s, a young Frenchman, Berenger by name, under\r\npretence of making an oblation, handed to the priest celebrant the\r\narchbishop’s letters, charging him to deliver them to the Bishop of\r\nLondon and publicly denouncing the latter excommunicate. Bishop Foliot,\r\nwhile accepting the sentence as valid, renewed his appeal to the pope,\r\nwho strongly disapproved of Becket’s action and ordered him to suspend\r\nhis sentences until the nuncios had seen the king.\r\n\r\nGratian and Vivian reached Damfront on 23rd August, and next day had an\r\ninterview with the king, in which he endeavoured to dictate to them,\r\ninsisting that the excommunicates should be absolved at once. For a week\r\nno progress was made, but on 31st August, at Bayeux, Henry undertook\r\nthat if the excommunicates were absolved at once he would receive back\r\nthe archbishop and his friends and allow him to hold his church and\r\nformer possessions “to the honour of God, of the Church, of the king and\r\nof the king’s sons.” Next day, however, he insisted upon the further\r\nsignificant addition of the phrase “saving the dignity of my realm.”\r\nEven to get so far as this had proved a difficult task. The meeting had\r\nbeen held in the open air, and twice Henry had mounted his horse and\r\nturned to ride off in a rage, expressing his contempt for the nuncios\r\nand their threats of excommunication and interdict. A proposal to\r\ncounterbalance the “dignity of the realm” with “the liberty of the\r\nChurch” having failed, negotiations were broken off. Becket, as papal\r\nlegate for England, having threatened to lay England under the dread\r\nsentence of interdict, by which all public services and religious\r\nministrations were suspended, Henry issued orders that the bearer of\r\nsuch a sentence and any persons who obeyed it should be held guilty of\r\nhigh treason, at the same time prohibiting all monks and clergy from\r\ncrossing the seas without his leave, and ordering the search of all\r\nlaymen coming into England from foreign countries. He further consented\r\nto another meeting with the archbishop at Montmartre, whither he had\r\ngone to visit King Louis.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations at Montmartre in November 1169 turned chiefly upon the\r\nquestion of the restoration of Becket’s estates. While the king was\r\nwilling to restore him to the possession of what he held when he left\r\nthe country, Thomas insisted upon full payment of all arrears, the\r\nsurrender of certain disputed estates and the displacement of such\r\nclergy as had been presented by the king to Canterbury livings during\r\nhis exile. Offers of arbitration were refused by Becket; and, while\r\nHenry consented that he should have all that his predecessors had on the\r\nsame terms by which they held, his promise of due service to the king\r\nwas qualified by the obnoxious phrase, “saving the honour of God.” Henry\r\ntherefore refused Becket the “kiss of peace,” and the conference broke\r\nup. The terms offered by Henry appear to have made a favourable\r\nimpression upon Pope Alexander, and he determined to make a final effort\r\nfor a settlement on those lines. Accordingly, in the early spring of\r\n1170, the Archbishop of Rouen and the Bishop of Nevers were appointed to\r\nnegotiate; the Canterbury estates were to be restored in full, but the\r\nquestion of arrears might be waived; there was to be no reference to the\r\nConstitutions, and the kiss of peace was to be given by either the king\r\nor his son. If Henry refused to come to terms sentence of interdict\r\nshould be laid upon his continental domains.\r\n\r\nNegotiations remained for some little time in abeyance, as Henry had\r\ncrossed to England, for the first time for four years, landing at\r\nPortsmouth on 3rd March, after a stormy passage during which at least\r\none of his forty ships was lost. The chief matter necessitating the\r\nking’s return to England was his intention of establishing the\r\nsuccession to the throne beyond all doubt by the coronation of his\r\neldest son, Henry, now sixteen years old. The need for this coronation\r\nof the heir during his father’s lifetime, for which precedents could be\r\nfound on the Continent but not in England, is far from clear, and its\r\nultimate results were to prove disastrous. The most immediate result was\r\nthe creation of a fresh grievance for Becket. It would seem that the\r\npope, willing to please Henry and not knowing that the right to crown\r\nkings was a privilege of the Archbishops of Canterbury, had granted\r\npermission for the Archbishop of York to crown the young Henry, or else\r\nsuch permission had been granted during the vacancy of Canterbury in\r\n1162. When the news of the proposed coronation reached Becket he wrote\r\nletters to Archbishop Roger and the English bishops in general\r\nprohibiting them from officiating, and similar letters were sent by the\r\npope; but none of these appear to have been delivered, and on Sunday,\r\n14th June, the younger Henry was crowned at Westminster by Archbishop\r\nRoger, the Bishops of London, Durham, Salisbury, and Rochester\r\nassisting. For some reason the young king’s wife, Margaret,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEAL OF THE “YOUNG KING” HENRY (1/1)]\r\n\r\nhad not been crowned with him, although a royal outfit had been provided\r\nfor her,[28] and she had been ordered to hold herself in readiness at\r\nCaen, where the queen was in residence. The omission was taken by\r\nMargaret’s father, King Louis, as a deliberate insult, and was possibly\r\nso intended; but it is far more probable that Henry had intended her to\r\nbe crowned with her husband, but had been obliged to hasten the\r\ncoronation in order to avoid the publication of the prohibitory papal\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nReturning to Normandy, Henry met the papal commissioners at Falaise and\r\nagreed to accept the terms which they proposed. They then had an\r\ninterview with Becket and persuaded him to come to Fréteval, where the\r\nFrench and English kings were to hold a conference. On 22nd July,\r\ntherefore, Thomas rode out to meet Henry. The king was in an excellent\r\ntemper, and as soon as he saw the archbishop he pressed forward, doffing\r\nhis cap and saluting him affectionately. The two then withdrew and held\r\na long private consultation. Becket began by reproaching Henry for his\r\naction in regard to the coronation. The king defended himself, pleading\r\nhistorical precedents, which Becket rejected as unsound, and producing\r\npapal letters granting leave for the Archbishop of York to crown the\r\nyoung Henry; these letters, however, dated from 1162, when, as we have\r\nseen, some such coronation was mooted if not actually performed, and\r\nwere issued during the vacancy of the see of Canterbury. In the end\r\nHenry promised to do justice in the matter, and added some ambiguous\r\nremarks to the effect that he would punish all who played either him or\r\nthe archbishop false. No word was said about the Constitutions, but the\r\nking promised to restore to Becket all that he had held three months\r\nbefore the date of his exile and to receive him and his friends back\r\ninto favour. Becket dismounted and knelt before the king, but the latter\r\nleapt from his horse, raised the archbishop and held his stirrup while\r\nhe remounted. The two old friends, once more united, rode back together\r\nand announced the conclusion of peace, to the amazement of all; and even\r\na passage of arms between the excommunicate Archdeacon of Canterbury and\r\nBecket, due to the latter’s refusal to reciprocate the king’s general\r\namnesty by absolving the excommunicates, was not allowed to disturb the\r\nserenity of the atmosphere. The only cloud was the king’s persistent\r\nrefusal of the kiss of peace, based on the rash oath which he had sworn\r\nin the presence of the French that he would never give it. On this Henry\r\nwas resolute, though he expressed his willingness to kiss “his mouth,\r\nand his hands, and his feet a hundred times” when he returned to\r\nEngland. So much importance did Becket attach to this symbolic act that\r\nhe endeavoured to obtain the kiss by a ruse at Amboise in October. For\r\nthis purpose he came to the chapel where Henry was going to hear mass,\r\nin the course of which service the king would be obliged to give the\r\nceremonial kiss; but, warned by the much excommunicated Nigel de\r\nSackville, Henry ordered the celebration of a mass for the dead, in\r\nwhich the ceremony of the _pax_ is omitted.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Henry wrote to the young king and the regency council in\r\nEngland announcing the conclusion of peace between himself and the\r\narchbishop, and ordering the restoration of the former possessions of\r\nthe see and the holding of a judicial inquiry into the question of the\r\nhonour of Saltwood. Early in November the king sent a message to Becket\r\nregretting that military affairs in Auvergne prevented his meeting him\r\nat Rouen, but urging him to delay his departure no longer, and\r\nappointing John of Oxford, Dean of Salisbury, to accompany him. Becket\r\naccordingly proceeded to Witsand, whence he was to cross to England.\r\nDuring the previous three months he had been busy corresponding with the\r\npope, and had procured from him letters suspending and excommunicating\r\nthe Archbishop of York, the bishops who had taken part with him, and the\r\ninevitable Archdeacon of Canterbury. The sentence against York, London,\r\nand Salisbury, Becket despatched from Witsand to Dover, where those\r\nprelates happened to be, before his own departure. At last, on 1st\r\nDecember 1170, the archbishop set sail, and, avoiding Dover, landed at\r\nSandwich. Here he was met by Randulf de Broc, Reynold de Warenne, and\r\nGervase of Cornhill, sheriff of Kent. Their threats of violence were\r\nrestrained by John of Oxford, and after reproaching the archbishop for\r\ncoming into the realm with fire and sword they suffered him to proceed\r\nto Canterbury, where he was joyfully welcomed by the clergy and\r\npopulace.\r\n\r\nThe messengers whom he had sent over after the conclusion of peace\r\nbetween himself and the king had warned him that the estates of the see\r\nhad been plundered, and their appeal to the royal officers for the\r\npromised restoration of property had been postponed long enough to\r\nenable the actual holders to secure the rents payable at Michaelmas.\r\nBecket now found that most of the Christmas rents had been anticipated,\r\nand the manors so thoroughly pillaged that nothing but empty barns and\r\nruinous houses remained. He had, however, other matters to occupy his\r\nmind: the representatives of the censured prelates came to him desiring\r\nhim to absolve their masters. So far as Archbishop Roger was concerned\r\nBecket professed inability, the pope having reserved his case to\r\nhimself, but he was ready to absolve the Bishops of London and\r\nSalisbury, conditionally on their undertaking to submit to the pope’s\r\ndemands. This they were willing to do, but they were dissuaded by\r\nArchbishop Roger, and all three went over to Normandy to make complaint\r\nto the king. Becket, anxious from personal affection as well as from\r\npolicy to pay his respects to the young king, sent Richard, Prior of St.\r\nMartin’s, to Winchester to announce his intention, and presented Henry\r\nwith three magnificent chargers gaily caparisoned. The king, or rather\r\nhis council, declined the archbishop’s proffered visit, but undeterred\r\nhe started for Winchester, intending after his visit to the court to\r\nmake a tour of visitation throughout his province. The first night he\r\nspent at Rochester and the next at the Bishop of Winchester’s house in\r\nSouthwark, but here he was met by Joscelin of Arundel, brother of Queen\r\nAdelisa, who ordered him to return to Canterbury. This he did, taking\r\nwith him a small escort of some five or six men-at-arms. The existence\r\nof this escort was magnified by his enemies into a charge of riding\r\nabout with a great army to capture the king’s castles, but it was\r\ncertainly necessary, for threats were being openly made against his\r\nlife, and the Brocs at Saltwood were indulging in a regular campaign of\r\noutrage and insult. They seized his wine, they hunted in his preserves,\r\npoached his deer and stole his hounds, and as a culminating insult cut\r\noff the tail of his pack-horse.\r\n\r\nBecket was not a man to suffer insult patiently, and on Christmas Day he\r\npreached in the cathedral, and, after alluding to the probability of his\r\nmurder, delivered a furious denunciation of his enemies, and\r\nexcommunicated Robert de Broc and a number of other offenders. The news\r\nof his action was at once conveyed to King Henry, who was keeping\r\nChristmas at Bur-le-Roi, near Bayeux. Infuriated by this fresh breach of\r\nthe peace, Henry uttered a wild tirade against the upstart priest and\r\nagainst his courtiers who sat idle and allowed their master to be\r\ninsulted without avenging him. Four knights, William de Tracy, Hugh de\r\nMoreville, Reynold Fitz-Urse, and Richard le Breton, determined to gain\r\nthe king’s favour by the murder of the archbishop. Taking horse at once\r\nthey made for the coast, and favoured by the wind reached Saltwood\r\nCastle on Monday, 28th December. Meanwhile Henry, while refusing to go\r\nso far as Engelger de Bohun and William Mauvoisin, who urged the\r\narchbishop’s execution, had determined on his arrest. Richard de Humet\r\nwas sent to England to Hugh de Gundeville and William Fitz-John, the\r\nyoung king’s guardians, while Earl William de Mandeville and Saer de\r\nQuincy watched the continental ports in case Becket should try to\r\nescape. The four knights, openly proclaiming that the king had decreed\r\nBecket’s death, collected a considerable force from the garrisons of the\r\nneighbouring castles, and on Tuesday, 29th December, rode into\r\nCanterbury. Failing to persuade the town authorities to assist them,\r\nthey warned them not to interfere and rode on to the palace. Striding\r\ninto the room where the archbishop and his attendants were sitting, the\r\nfour knights, without a word of greeting, sat down in front of him.\r\nAfter a pause Reynold Fitz-Urse ordered him, in the king’s name, to\r\nabsolve the excommunicates and afterwards to stand his trial before the\r\nyoung king at Winchester. Before they delivered their ultimatum, Becket,\r\nunderstanding that they had a private message from the king, had caused\r\nhis attendants to withdraw, but he now recalled them and delivered a\r\ncalm and dignified reply justifying his action and explaining his\r\nposition. To their threats he replied that the king had granted him his\r\npeace, but that in any case he would never yield or waver in his\r\nobedience to God and the pope for fear of death.\r\n\r\nThe knights had entered the archbishop’s presence unarmed, and they now\r\nwithdrew, uttering threats and defiance, to bring the argument of steel\r\nto bear where words had proved unavailing. The Brocs and others of their\r\nassociates had seized the gatehouse of the palace and placed it in\r\ncharge of Simon de Crioill and William Fitz-Nigel, the archbishop’s\r\nsteward, who had joined the conspirators; Becket’s own esquire, Robert\r\nLegge, was forced by Reynold Fitz-Urse to assist in arming him, and one\r\nof the archbishop’s knights, Ralph Morin, was placed under arrest. As\r\nthe armed crowd pressed forward the great door of the archbishop’s\r\napartments was shut and bolted and for a moment they were foiled, but\r\nRobert de Broc knew the palace well, and, snatching up an axe left on\r\nthe stairs by a workman, attacked a wooden partition that would give\r\naccess to their victim’s room. Hearing the crash and splintering of the\r\nwoodwork the monks and clerks, powerless against the mail-clad\r\nassassins, seized Becket, and in spite of his protests and resistance\r\nhurried him by a private entrance into the church. Contrary to his\r\nwishes the door was shut behind him, but when the pursuers began to\r\nthunder upon it he insisted upon its being opened, that the church might\r\nnot seem to be turned into a fortress. The four knights and their\r\nfollowers rushed in, headed by Reynold Fitz-Urse, who flung down the axe\r\nwith which he had attacked the door and brandished his sword. Hugh de\r\nMoreville faced the terrified people clustered in the body of the\r\nchurch, while his comrades searched for their victim. In the pillared\r\ngloom of the dim evening Becket was not at first visible, and he could\r\neasily have escaped into the darkness of the crypt or by the\r\nneighbouring stairway to the safety of the roof, but hearing cries of\r\n“Where is the traitor? Where is the archbishop?” he stepped forward,\r\nsaying, “Here am I, no traitor but the priest of God. And I marvel that\r\nyou are come into the church of God in such guise. What will ye with\r\nme?” To their threats of instant death he replied by commending his soul\r\nto God, St. Mary, St. Denis, and St. Elphage, and their endeavours to\r\ndrive or drag him out of the church he resisted with all his strength,\r\nstriking William Tracy a blow which almost felled him to the ground.\r\nTracy replied with a cut at his head, but Edward Grim, one of the only\r\nthree clerks who had remained with their master, intercepted the blow\r\nwith his arm. Although most of the force of the stroke was spent on\r\nEdward Grim it drew blood from the archbishop’s head. A second blow,\r\nfrom Reynold’s sword, drove Becket\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MURDER OF BECKET\r\n\r\n(From Harl. MS. 5102)]\r\n\r\nto his knees, and with the third he fell with his arms stretched out\r\ntowards the altar of St. Benedict. As he fell Richard le Breton struck\r\nhim again with such violence that his sword broke upon the pavement,\r\ncrying, “Take that for the love of my lord William, the king’s brother,”\r\nRichard having served the young William, whose early death was\r\nattributed to the foiling of his matrimonial schemes by Becket. As the\r\nassassins turned to leave the church, one Hugh Mauclerc, whose name is\r\nunknown to history save for this infamy, thrust his sword into Becket’s\r\ngaping skull and scattered his brains upon the pavement. Thus fell\r\nThomas Becket, the obstinate and imperious archbishop, and thus rose\r\nfrom his dead body Thomas of Canterbury, martyr and virtual patron saint\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nHaving wreaked their vengeance on the archbishop the murderers turned to\r\nthe plunder of his palace. Everything of value they seized, sending off\r\na parcel of papal bulls and similar documents to their royal master.\r\nThen they rode off, the four knights soon afterwards retiring to\r\nMoreville’s castle of Knaresborough, while the Brocs remained at\r\nSaltwood, whence they threatened to return to Canterbury and outrage the\r\nmartyr’s body. Hearing of their threats the monks of Canterbury, by the\r\nadvice of the Abbot of Boxley and the Prior of Dover, proceeded at once\r\nto bury the body, which, after lying for some time neglected during the\r\npanic which followed the murder, had been reverently placed before the\r\nhigh altar. Accordingly the martyred archbishop was laid in a marble\r\ntomb in the crypt, clad in the penitential hair-shirt, which, to the\r\nsurprise of all, he was found to have worn beneath his other garments,\r\nand in the vestments worn at the time of his ordination and preserved by\r\nhim against his burial. The church having been polluted by bloodshed,\r\nMass could not be said in it, and so without the rites and services of\r\nthe Church were laid to rest the remains of him whose shrine was to be\r\nfor future generations the great national centre of prayer and\r\npilgrimage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nIRISH AFFAIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen news of Becket’s murder reached Henry at Argentan on 1st January\r\n1171, he was terribly perturbed, and, retiring to his apartments,\r\nremained for three days in solitude, fasting and reviewing the\r\nsituation. It must have seemed at first as if the officious knights by\r\ntheir rash action had wrecked his whole policy. The murder was bound to\r\nalienate many whose sympathy would otherwise have been with the king; it\r\nwould put a fresh weapon in the hands of his enemies; and, above all, it\r\nwould practically force the pope into that position of direct antagonism\r\nwhich he had hitherto skilfully contrived to evade. To extract himself\r\nfrom his position without complete loss of dignity and surrender of all\r\nfor which he had fought was a task worthy of Henry’s diplomatic genius.\r\nIt was necessary to be cautious but prompt, for his enemies were losing\r\nno time; before Henry had resumed public life the Archbishop of Sens,\r\nlegate of France, King Louis and the Count of Blois had all written to\r\nPope Alexander denouncing Henry as the murderer, and three weeks later\r\nthe Archbishop of Sens had proclaimed an interdict upon the king’s\r\ncontinental dominions on the strength of a papal letter addressed to\r\nhimself and the Archbishop of Rouen ordering such a course to be adopted\r\nin the event of the arrest or imprisonment of the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury. Against this action the Archbishop of Rouen and the Bishops\r\nof Worcester, Evreux, and Lisieux at once appealed, and the interdict\r\nwas temporarily suspended. About the end of January, when the appellants\r\nand the king’s special envoys started for the papal court at Frascati,\r\nnews of the murder reached the pope. Accordingly when Richard Barre, the\r\nArchdeacons of Salisbury and Lisieux, and the other royal envoys reached\r\nFrascati they could not at first obtain a hearing, and it was generally\r\nbelieved that on Maundy Thursday, 25th March, the pope would\r\nexcommunicate Henry and lay England under interdict. The efforts of the\r\nenvoys, however, backed with the powerful argument of English gold,\r\naverted this danger, and the dreaded day brought forth only an\r\nexcommunication of the actual murderers and their abettors. A month\r\nlater, after hearing the appeal of the Bishops of Worcester and Evreux,\r\nPope Alexander confirmed the sentence of interdict published by the\r\nArchbishop of Sens, but exempted the king and gave orders for the\r\nabsolution of the Bishops of London and Salisbury. At the same time he\r\nannounced his intention of sending legates to Henry to settle the terms\r\nof his absolution.\r\n\r\nHenry meanwhile was preparing to carry into effect the plan which he had\r\nhad to abandon in 1155 for an invasion of Ireland. The scheme possessed\r\nseveral attractions. To begin with, affairs in that island really called\r\nfor his active interference; there was also the advantage that in\r\nIreland he would be more completely out of reach of any unwelcome papal\r\nmessengers than he would be in almost any other spot in the civilised\r\nworld; and finally, by undertaking the reform of the Irish Church, which\r\nhad been urged upon him by Pope Adrian IV., he would give to his\r\nexpedition something of the nature of a crusade and would earn the\r\ngratitude of the pope.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1166 Ireland had been practically exempt from English\r\ninterference and had settled its own affairs by primitive methods of\r\nviolence. Resembling their nearest neighbours, the Welsh, in many\r\nrespects, the Irish were even more quarrelsome and less advanced in the\r\nsocial scale. Utterly lacking in political unity, their score of kings\r\nand princelets acknowledged the theoretical supremacy of their Head\r\nKing, or Ard-Righ, for just so long as he could maintain his position by\r\npower of the battle-axe. The battle-axe, that excellent weapon for\r\nquick-tempered men, doing its work with complete finality in less time\r\nthan a man can unsheathe sword or notch arrow to bow, was the constant\r\ncompanion of the Irishman and the arbiter of all his politics. By a not\r\nunusual combination the Irish were at the same time utter barbarians and\r\nconsummate artists. Their poetry was of a high standard; in music no\r\nnation but the Welsh could compare with them; and in metal work,\r\ncarving, and painting such fragments as have come down to us show a\r\ncomplete mastery of the beauties of line and colour. Commerce they left\r\nto the Scandinavian settlers along their seaboard. Possessing a fertile\r\nsoil and a favourable climate they lacked the industry and stability for\r\nagriculture, but grazed great quantities of cattle, which served alike\r\nfor the standard of exchange, coined money not being in use, and for the\r\nobjective of raids during their incessant hostilities. When St. Patrick\r\nbanished the reptiles and vermin it would seem that they must have left\r\ntheir venom and vice behind for the use of the inhabitants of the\r\nisland, for never was there a race so prone to anger, so ungrateful and\r\nso treacherous, and even the miracles recorded of their saints were more\r\noften concerned with vengeance wrought upon sacrilegious offenders than\r\nwith rewards bestowed upon faithful devotees.\r\n\r\nIn this race of Ishmaelites there was one man of evil pre-eminence whose\r\nhand was against all men and all men’s against him. Dermot MacMurrogh,\r\nKing of Leinster, since the beginning of his reign in 1121 had had even\r\nmore than his share of fighting; his voice had grown hoarse with the\r\nshouting of his battle-cry; his borders had been enlarged at the expense\r\nof his neighbours, and the envy and hatred of rival chieftains had been\r\nincurred without gaining him the affection of his own subjects. In 1152\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IRISH WOMAN PLAYING A ZITHER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IRISHMEN ROWING IN A CORACLE\r\n\r\n(From Royal MS. 13 B.viii)]\r\n\r\nhe had carried off Dervorgille, the beautiful but middle-aged wife of\r\nTiernan O’Rourke, King of Breifny; as the lady was well past forty and\r\nDermot some ten years older the elopement would seem to have been less a\r\nmatter of romantic passion than a studied insult to Tiernan. Dermot was\r\nspeedily forced by Turlogh O’Conor, then Ard-Righ, to give up\r\nDervorgille, but escaped for the time any serious consequences.\r\nO’Rourke, however, did not forget, and at last, in 1166, found an\r\nopportunity to head a formidable combination against Dermot. Finding\r\nhimself isolated Dermot seems to have looked to England for help, for\r\n“the chancellor of the Irish king” came to this country in 1166, and\r\ncertain Irishmen appear to have visited Henry’s court at Woodstock early\r\nin the same year.[29] No assistance being obtained and resistance being\r\nimpossible, Dermot, with some sixty followers, crossed to England and\r\nsettled for a time at Bristol under the protection of the wealthy Robert\r\nFitz-Harding.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1167 Dermot crossed to Normandy and had an interview\r\nwith King Henry. The latter had his hands too full to meddle with Irish\r\naffairs, but the opportunity for getting some sort of footing in Ireland\r\nwhich might be useful in the future was too good to be missed; he\r\ntherefore took Dermot’s homage and issued a general licence in vague\r\nterms encouraging any of his subjects to assist the exiled king. With\r\nthis Dermot returned to Bristol, and after vain attempts to obtain\r\nassistance in England crossed into Wales, where he succeeded in\r\ninteresting Richard of Clare, Earl of Pembroke, in his cause. The earl,\r\nwhose extravagance had seriously impaired his finances, was attracted by\r\nthe hope of plunder and broad lands and by the promise of Dermot’s\r\ndaughter Eva in marriage, with the ultimate prospect of the throne of\r\nLeinster; he was, however, too cautious to risk his English and Welsh\r\nestates by embarking on this enterprise before he had obtained leave\r\nfrom King Henry. Dermot therefore turned to King Rhys of South Wales,\r\nwho not only gave him a small force of soldiers but undertook to allow\r\nhis prisoner, Robert Fitz-Stephen of Cardigan, to collect troops and\r\ncross over to Ireland. At last Dermot landed in his country once more\r\nwith a small force, part of which was commanded by Richard Fitz-Godebert\r\nof Pembrokeshire. After a little fighting Dermot came to terms with his\r\nadversaries and dismissed his mercenaries.\r\n\r\nFor a short time Dermot remained quiet, but about the end of 1168 he\r\ndespatched his interpreter, Morice Regan, to remind Robert Fitz-Stephen\r\nof his promise and to obtain other assistance. Fitz-Stephen accordingly\r\ncrossed to Ireland early in May 1169. With him came Meiler Fitz-Henry,\r\ngrandson of Henry I., and Miles, son of the Bishop of St. David’s,\r\nMaurice Prendergast and Hervey de Montmorency, the needy uncle of Earl\r\nRichard, and Robert de Barri, a nephew of Fitz-Stephen and brother of\r\nthe historian Gerald. These adventurers landed with some three hundred\r\nfollowers at Bannow near Wexford, and here they were welcomed by Dermot\r\nand his son Donnell Kavanagh. An assault on Wexford was repelled with\r\nloss, but next day the city surrendered and was granted to Fitz-Stephen.\r\nThis success was followed by an expedition against the King of Ossory,\r\nin which the English, by skilful manœuvring, drew the Irish out into\r\nopen ground, where they were able to use their cavalry with deadly\r\neffect; the flying natives were further punished by an ambuscade of\r\narchers, and at the end of the day two hundred heads were laid before\r\nDermot for that savage king to gloat upon. MacKelan of Offelan and\r\nO’Toole of Glendalough were defeated and plundered, but Roderic O’Conor,\r\nthe Ard-Righ, was able to force Dermot to acknowledge his supremacy and\r\nto surrender his son as hostage. Tired of the somewhat unprofitable\r\nfighting, Maurice Prendergast and his two hundred men proposed to return\r\nto Wales, but Dermot refused to let them sail from Wexford. Maurice at\r\nonce transferred his services to the King of Ossory and assisted his\r\nformer enemy against his former friends until such time as he discovered\r\nthat the jealous men of Ossory were plotting his destruction, when he\r\nwithdrew his contingent secretly by night to Waterford and thence\r\ncrossed into Wales.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that Maurice Prendergast left Ireland Maurice\r\nFitz-Gerald, a half-brother of Robert Fitz-Stephen, had landed with some\r\nhundred and forty soldiers, and not long afterwards, in the early\r\nsummer of 1170, the Earl of Pembroke obtained leave from King Henry to\r\nundertake the Irish adventure. He first sent a small force under the\r\nredoubtable Raymond the Big, who threw up a temporary fort at Dundonuil,\r\nwhere they had hard work to defend themselves. By the ingenious device\r\nof driving a herd of cattle before them the invaders shattered the Irish\r\nranks and, profiting by the confusion, slew many and captured seventy\r\nprisoners. By the advice of Hervey de Montmorency the prisoners were\r\nbutchered, the business of beheading them being entrusted to a\r\nbloodthirsty Welsh girl whose lover had been killed in that battle.\r\nShortly afterwards Earl Richard landed with Maurice Prendergast, Miles\r\nde Cogan, and other barons and fifteen hundred men. Two days later, on\r\n25th August, the attack on Waterford began, and its capture was\r\ncelebrated by the marriage of the earl and Eva, daughter of King Dermot.\r\nThe king and his English allies next marched against Dublin, avoiding\r\nthe great host assembled against them under the Ard-Righ on Clondalkin\r\nmoor. The city was not prepared to offer armed resistance, and the terms\r\nof surrender were being discussed between Morice Regan, Dermot’s\r\nrepresentative, and the saintly Archbishop Laurence O’Toole and Hasculf\r\nTorkil’s son, the Scandinavian lord of Dublin, when suddenly, without\r\nwarning, Miles de Cogan, who had no intention of being deprived of his\r\nanticipated loot by the peaceful surrender of the city, raised his war\r\ncry and stormed the walls. Hasculf and such of the inhabitants as were\r\nfortunate enough to gain the ships escaped by water, but very many were\r\nslain and the city was given over to plunder. Miles was rewarded for his\r\ntreacherous act by the grant of the custody of the city, while Earl\r\nRichard retired to Waterford and Dermot to his capital at Ferns, where\r\non 1st January, 1171, he died.\r\n\r\nBy the death of Dermot MacMurrogh, Earl Richard became virtual King of\r\nLeinster. But the success of the earl and his companion adventurers was\r\nby no means a cause of satisfaction to King Henry, who had no intention\r\nof allowing a warlike and independent kingdom to grow up so close to his\r\nown realm. He accordingly made his feelings on this subject obvious by\r\nseizing the Earl of Pembroke’s English estates, and the earl hastened to\r\nclear himself from the charge of disloyalty by sending his lieutenant,\r\nRaymond the Big, to place all his conquests at the king’s disposal.\r\nHenry, who had gone so far as to forbid the sending of any assistance in\r\nmen or munitions to Ireland and to order the immediate return of the\r\nadventurers on pain of perpetual banishment, was not appeased, though he\r\ndetermined to profit by the earl’s submission. Raymond seems to have\r\nreturned to his lord with an order for the latter’s personal appearance\r\nbefore the king. Matters, however, were too involved to permit of Earl\r\nRichard’s immediate departure. Under pressure from Archbishop Laurence\r\nO’Toole King Roderic O’Conor had summoned a great force for the siege\r\nof Dublin, and all the native chiefs had rallied round him, glad of an\r\nopportunity of revenging the wrongs they had suffered at the hands of\r\nthe foreign invaders. Provisions soon began to fail in the city, and an\r\nattempt to come to terms having failed, the Ard-Righ insisting upon the\r\nsurrender of all the conquered territory except the three towns of\r\nDublin, Waterford, and Wexford, the only course open was to risk all in\r\nan attack upon the besieging host. The attempt might well seem desperate\r\nin view of the disparity of numbers, but its very boldness proved its\r\nsalvation. Leaving a small garrison to guard the city, some six hundred\r\npicked men marched out in three columns, under Miles de Cogan, Raymond\r\nthe Big, and the earl himself. The surprise was completely successful;\r\nsecure in the knowledge of their numbers the Irish had neglected\r\noutposts or guards and were caught quite unprepared; many of them were\r\nactually bathing when the English cavalry dashed into their camp.\r\nDiscouraged by this severe defeat, in which they lost very heavily, the\r\nIrish forces broke up and drifted away. Earl Richard was now free to\r\nattempt the relief of Robert Fitz-Stephen, who, after dangerously\r\ndepleting his own forces to strengthen the garrison of Dublin, had been\r\ngallantly standing a siege in his castle of Carrick near Wexford. The\r\nearl’s forces, after a desperate action in the pass of Odrone, in which\r\nMeiler Fitz-Henry particularly distinguished himself, reached Wexford to\r\nfind the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IRISH AXEMEN\r\n\r\n(From Royal MS. B.viii)]\r\n\r\ntown in flames, Carrick Castle fallen and Fitz-Stephen a prisoner. The\r\nearl now turned to Waterford and prepared for an expedition against\r\nMacDonnchadh, King of Ossory, but the latter offered to come in and make\r\nterms if his old ally Maurice Prendergast would obtain him a safe\r\nconduct. This Maurice did, but when MacDonnchadh came before the earl,\r\nKing O’Brien of Munster, who was acting at this time with the English,\r\nurged his arrest and execution, and it was only by the vigorous action\r\nof Prendergast, who brought his men-at-arms on the scene, that the\r\nbarons were prevented from thus treacherously breaking their oaths.\r\n\r\nLeinster was now pacified and a further imperative summons from King\r\nHenry, already on his way towards Pembroke, necessitated the departure\r\nof Earl Richard. Hardly had he gone when Hasculf, the former lord of\r\nDublin, landed with an army raised from Norway, the Isles, and Man,\r\nunder the command of a man known from the berserk fury of his valour as\r\nJohn the Wode, or the Mad. These well-armed Scandinavians were foes of a\r\ndifferent type from the wild Irish, but Miles de Cogan boldly charged\r\nupon them from the east gate, while his brother Richard, with a small\r\nforce of thirty men-at-arms, rode secretly out of the west gate to take\r\nthem in the rear. John the Wode, wielding his great axe with fearful\r\neffect, forced back the English, and had even gained footing within the\r\ngate when Richard’s attack threw his men into confusion. Rallying his\r\nforces Miles charged again upon the Northmen, who broke and fled; John\r\nthe Wode was killed fighting gallantly, and Hasculf was captured and\r\nbeheaded. Another assault on the city, early in September, by the forces\r\nof Tiernan O’Rourke, ended disastrously for the Irish, and Dublin was\r\nleft in peace.\r\n\r\nHenry had landed at Portsmouth on 2nd August, and after a visit to the\r\naged Bishop Henry of Winchester, then on his deathbed, had marched\r\ntowards Bristol. At Newnham, in Gloucestershire, he was met by Earl\r\nRichard, who surrendered to him the cities of Dublin, Waterford, and\r\nWexford, receiving in return the royal favour and a grant in fee of the\r\nresidue of his conquests. About 8th September, when the English army was\r\napproaching the borders of Wales, King Rhys ap Gruffudd came to meet\r\nHenry with the offer of a tribute of horses and oxen. This tribute Henry\r\nsoon afterwards respited, taking only thirty-six horses as a token of\r\nfriendship; at the same time he restored to Rhys his son Howel, who had\r\nlong been held as hostage. Rhys showed his appreciation of the king’s\r\nfriendship next year by sending Howel to the English court to serve King\r\nHenry. The peaceful passage of the English army in Pembrokeshire, where\r\nthe fleet was assembling at Milford Haven, had been secured by this\r\ntactful conciliation of King Rhys, and a troublesome chieftain, Jorwerth\r\nap Owain, was reduced to order by the capture of his castle of\r\nCaerleon-on-Usk before Henry reached Pembroke. For some three weeks the\r\nEnglish host lay weather-bound at Pembroke, part of the time being spent\r\nby Henry in a pilgrimage to St. David’s, where he offered in the\r\ncathedral and visited the bishop, David Fitz-Gerald. At last, on 16th\r\nOctober, the wind shifted and the fleet of some two hundred vessels\r\ncrossed over to Crook, near Waterford. For a fortnight Henry remained at\r\nWaterford, the government of which town he had entrusted to Robert\r\nFitz-Bernard. Here he received the submission of the kings and\r\nchieftains of Ireland, with the exception of the lords of Ulster and\r\nRoderic O’Conor, the Ard-Righ. Hither also the men of Wexford, in\r\naccordance with an undertaking given to Henry at Pembroke by their\r\nenvoys, brought Robert Fitz-Stephen and his fellow-prisoners; and Henry,\r\nwhose personal intervention in Ireland had been influenced in some\r\ndegree by complaints of the tyranny of some of the adventurers, thought\r\nit politic to appease the natives by committing Robert to prison for a\r\nshort time. If he was mindful of the demands of justice he was still\r\nmore mindful of his proposed reformation of the Irish Church, and having\r\nreceived the homage of the Irish bishops he summoned a council or synod\r\nat Cashel in November.\r\n\r\nAt this Council of Cashel canons were passed for the observance of the\r\ndegrees of affinity in marriage, the performance of baptisms by priests\r\nin the church--the local custom being for the father of the child\r\nimmediately after its birth to plunge it three times into water, or into\r\nmilk if the family were noble or wealthy--the payment of tithes, and\r\nthe immunity of clerks and church property from secular exactions. As\r\nsoon as it was over Henry sent an account of the proceedings, and of the\r\nsubmission tendered to him by the bishops and princes of Ireland, to the\r\npope by the hands of the Archdeacon of Llandaff. It would seem that he\r\nalso endeavoured to obtain from Alexander a confirmation of Pope\r\nAdrian’s commendatory letter issued in 1155, at the time when the\r\nconquest of Ireland was first proposed. Alexander did not grant this\r\nconfirmation, but wrote letters to Henry, to the bishops and to the\r\nkings of Ireland, expressing his satisfaction at the steps taken to\r\nremedy the monstrous irregularities of which the Irish had been guilty,\r\nand his hope that Henry’s supremacy would make for the peace and better\r\ngovernment of the island. These letters must have reached England some\r\ntime in the summer of 1172. Henry, however, does not seem to have been\r\nsatisfied with these expressions of papal approval; possibly he had in\r\nthe first instance obtained the submission of the Irish prelates by\r\nrepresenting himself as commissioned by Pope Alexander to reform their\r\nChurch; however this may be, it would seem that a synod was held at\r\nWaterford to which William Fitz-Audelin brought probably Alexander’s\r\nletters and certainly the letter of Adrian (that famous centre of\r\ncontroversy “the Bull _Laudabiliter_,” so called from its beginning with\r\nthe word _Laudabiliter_ and, as befits an Irish document, its not being\r\na Bull),[30] and with it a confirmation by Pope Alexander, which was\r\nalmost undoubtedly a forgery.\r\n\r\nBut before this synod of Waterford was held much had happened. Christmas\r\nin 1171 had been spent by the king at Dublin, where an elaborate palace,\r\nbuilt of wattles in the native fashion, had been erected for him, and\r\nwhere the magnificence and luxury of his household, simple though it was\r\nif judged by continental standards, struck surprise into the minds of\r\nthe Irish. But if the royal table presented a spectacle of unwonted\r\nluxury to the natives, the food of the country, the absence of wine, and\r\nthe impurity of the water proved disastrous to the English. An\r\nexceptionally stormy winter aggravated the scarcity of provisions and\r\nconsequent mortality, prevented operations against Roderic of Connaught,\r\nand by severing all connection with England left Henry a prey to\r\nunappeasable anxiety. Early in March 1172, news having possibly reached\r\nhim of the arrival of the papal legates in Normandy, he moved down to\r\nWexford, the greater part of his army going at the end of the month to\r\nWaterford; but for over six weeks the weather rendered the crossing to\r\nWales impossible, and it was not till Easter Monday, 17th April, that\r\nHenry landed near St. David’s, whence he made his way to Portsmouth,\r\nfrom which place he crossed to Normandy early in May.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the papal legates, coupled with rumours of a conspiracy\r\nbeing formed by the young King Henry and his brothers, had compelled\r\nHenry to return from Ireland without attempting the subjugation of the\r\nArd-Righ and without strengthening his hold upon the portions of the\r\nisland already conquered by the erection of a series of castles. Before\r\nleaving, however, he took measures intended apparently to weaken the\r\npower of the original adventurers alike for action independent of\r\nhimself and for the oppression of the natives. The government of Dublin,\r\nwith the province of Meath, he granted to Hugh de Lacy, a man of\r\ncharacter and ability, who justified his selection by adopting a just\r\nand conciliatory policy towards the Irish. With him were associated in\r\nthe charge of the city Robert Fitz-Stephen and Meiler Fitz-Henry, while\r\nWaterford and Wexford were committed to Robert Fitz-Bernard. Earl\r\nRichard retained possession of Leinster, and was apparently recognised\r\nas in control of the conquered portion of Ireland; while the province of\r\nUlster, whose chiefs had refused to accept the English supremacy, was\r\nhanded over to John de Courcy to subdue and enjoy as best he might.\r\n\r\nThe earl, who had made Kildare his chief seat, had bestowed his daughter\r\nin marriage upon Robert de Quency, whom he created hereditary constable\r\nof Leinster; but not long after the marriage Robert was killed in an\r\nexpedition against O’Dempsey of Offaly, leaving an infant daughter, who\r\neventually married the son of Maurice Prendergast. Raymond the Big then\r\ndemanded the hand of the earl’s widowed daughter, with the\r\nconstableship, and upon his demand being refused retired into Wales.\r\nAbout the same time, in the summer of 1173, Henry, hard pressed by the\r\nrebellion of his sons, summoned some of the leading barons from Ireland,\r\nincluding Earl Richard, whom he made governor of Gisors. The appointment\r\nwas of short duration, and the earl was soon invested with the\r\ngovernment of Dublin, Waterford, and Wexford, and sent back to Ireland\r\nwith letters recalling Hugh de Lacy, Fitz-Stephen, Fitz-Bernard,\r\nPrendergast, and others, who crossed at once, in time to take part in\r\nthe battle at Fornham on 17th October 1173. The English forces in\r\nIreland were thus seriously depleted, and an expedition led by the earl\r\nand Hervey de Montmorency into Munster having ended disastrously, all\r\nIreland began to rise and endeavour to shake off the foreign yoke. Earl\r\nRichard hastily sent for Raymond, promising him the hand of his\r\ndaughter, for which he had asked in vain before; Raymond responded to\r\nthe offer, landed with a small force at Waterford and marched to\r\nWexford, where he reduced the town to order and obtained his coveted\r\nbride. Next year, in 1175, he led a force into Limerick and captured\r\nthat town, but his successes, and possibly his excesses also, were\r\ndispleasing to King Henry, and early in 1176 he was summoned to England\r\nto account for his actions. The state of affairs at Limerick, however,\r\nwas too desperate to permit of his absence, and after relieving the\r\ngarrison he thought it good policy to obtain a renewal of their oaths of\r\nfealty to the king of England from the kings of Connaught and Thomond.\r\nRaymond was therefore still in Ireland at the beginning of June 1176,\r\nwhen Earl Richard died and William Fitz-Audelin landed as procurator or\r\njusticiary of Ireland.\r\n\r\nFitz-Audelin and his two coadjutors, Miles de Cogan and Robert\r\nFitz-Stephen, were recalled in 1177, and Hugh de Lacy was appointed\r\njusticiary, Fitz-Audelin being associated with Robert le Poer in the\r\ncustody of Waterford and Wexford, Miles and Robert receiving South\r\nMunster, and North Munster, as yet unsubdued, being granted to Philip de\r\nBraose,[31] from which he got as little good as he deserved. For the\r\nnext seven years Henry left Ireland pretty much to itself, and Lacy\r\ncontinued to strengthen the position of the English settlement by\r\nbuilding castles and by a firm but conciliatory attitude towards the\r\nnatives. Unfortunately his success, coupled with his marriage with a\r\ndaughter of the king of Connaught, aroused Henry’s jealousy, and in 1184\r\nhe was removed from office. As early as 1177 Henry had declared his\r\nintention of making his young son John king of Ireland, and in 1185 the\r\nfurtherance of this design afforded an excuse for keeping the beloved\r\nboy from the distant dangers of the Crusade. John was at this time in\r\nhis nineteenth year, vain, pampered, vicious, and as completely void of\r\nany redeeming virtue as any young man could be. His father, to whom he\r\nwas as the apple of his eye, could hardly have found in all his broad\r\nrealms any person more dangerously incompetent to undertake the\r\ndifficult government of Ireland.\r\n\r\nOn 31st March 1185, the king knighted his son at Windsor, and almost\r\nimmediately afterwards John set out, under the charge of Ranulph de\r\nGlanville, the justiciar, for Gloucester. After a few days’ stay in that\r\ncity the heavy baggage and provisions for the expedition, with the\r\ngreater part of the forces, were sent on to Bristol, while John himself\r\nwith the remainder passed on to Milford Haven, whence he sailed for\r\nWaterford on 24th April. His force was of imposing dimensions--it is\r\nsaid to have contained three hundred knights--and as we find such men as\r\nWilliam le Poer and Stephen le Flemeng each bringing fifty horses, the\r\ntotal number of the cavalry must have been large; there was probably a\r\ncontingent of Flemish mercenaries, as Godescalk, “the master of the\r\nFlemish serjeants,” came from Kent, and there must have been the usual\r\nproportions of archers and foot soldiers. Significant is the entry on\r\nthe Pipe Rolls of payments for Roger Rastel and other huntsmen with\r\nhorses and dogs who went from Somerset into Ireland, and still more\r\nsignificant are the entries of large sums spent in furnishing John’s\r\nkitchen and bakery. The bulk of John’s followers were Norman courtiers,\r\ndespising their English companions, who in turn regarded the Irish as\r\ndespicable savages. On John’s arrival the friendly chieftains came to\r\nwelcome the son of the most powerful prince in Christendom, but found an\r\nill-mannered youth surrounded by a crowd of fashionable effeminate\r\nflatterers. The Normans mocked at the barbaric dress of the native\r\nprinces, and carried their ill-bred insolence so far as to pluck them by\r\ntheir long beards. In justifiable anger the princes left the court at\r\nWaterford and went to warn their compatriots of the treatment in store\r\nfor them. The kings of Connaught, Limerick, and Cork, who had meditated\r\ntendering their fealty to John, now naturally held aloof, and soon the\r\nfaithful natives were driven by the insults and injuries suffered at the\r\nhands of the invaders into active revolt. Meanwhile the newcomers had\r\ncompletely alienated the early settlers, depriving them of their\r\nhard-won conquests and distributing offices of importance and honour\r\nwith a complete disregard for the fitness of the candidates. The Norman\r\ncourtiers, used to the luxurious life of large towns and the\r\naristocratic campaigning of the Continent, utterly refused to endure the\r\nhardships inseparable from service in the interior of the country, and\r\nclung to the seaboard towns where alone wine was available. Hugh de Lacy\r\nand the barons who had won and held Leinster by their strength and\r\nmilitary ability kept grimly aloof and watched disaster after disaster\r\novertake the incompetent and inexperienced army of invasion.\r\n\r\nMatters soon reached such a pitch that it was clear that some man of\r\nability must be put in command, and accordingly in the autumn of 1185\r\nJohn de Courcy, whose conquest of Ulster had proved him to be a warrior\r\nof consummate skill and daring, was appointed chief governor with\r\nexcellent effect, and two months later Prince John returned to England.\r\nHe had no difficulty in persuading his infatuated father that his\r\nfailure was due to the treachery of Hugh de Lacy, and it was with\r\nunconcealed delight that Henry heard of Lacy’s murder in 1186. Early in\r\nthat same year Pope Urban III. had acceded to Henry’s request for the\r\ncoronation of John as king of Ireland, and had even sent him a crown of\r\ngold and peacocks’ feathers--borrowed plumes sufficiently suitable for\r\nthe empty head they were to adorn. John was therefore despatched to\r\nIreland to seize Lacy’s great fief into the king’s hand in August, but\r\nbefore he could sail news arrived of the death of his brother Geoffrey,\r\nand he was recalled. For the remaining three years of his reign Henry\r\nwas too busy with English and foreign affairs to devote his attention to\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE REBELLION OF THE YOUNG KING\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry had left Ireland, as we have seen, on 17th April 1172, and about\r\nthe second week in May he crossed from Portsmouth to Barfleur with a\r\nconsiderable following, at least twenty-five ships accompanying him. On\r\n17th May he met the cardinals at Savigny, and was informed by them of\r\nthe terms offered by the pope for his reconciliation to the Church. It\r\nwould seem that these included the entire abrogation of the\r\nConstitutions of Clarendon, and to this Henry absolutely declined to\r\nconsent, declaring that sooner than accept these conditions he would\r\nreturn to Ireland. The diplomatic Bishop Arnulf of Lisieux now\r\nintervened and succeeded in effecting a compromise, and on Sunday, 21st\r\nMay, Henry came to the cathedral of Avranches and was absolved from the\r\nguilt of the murder of Becket on a promise to comply with the modified\r\nrequirements of the legates. He was to find the money to support two\r\nhundred men-at-arms for one year in the Holy Land, to go for three years\r\non Crusade, to restore the property of the church of Canterbury, and\r\ntake back into favour all who had suffered for their support of the\r\narchbishop; he was also to support the claims of Alexander and his\r\nsuccessors against the schismatics, to permit appeals to the pope in\r\necclesiastical causes, and to abolish all customs injurious to the\r\nChurch which had been newly introduced in his reign. The wording of the\r\nlast clause left matters exactly as they were at the beginning of the\r\nquarrel with Becket, for the whole point of the dispute was Henry’s\r\ncontention that the Constitutions were in force in the time of his\r\ngrandfather. The final issue of the conflict was thus decidedly in\r\nHenry’s favour, and the murder, instead of proving, as it must have done\r\nin the case of a less able man, disastrous, had actually been\r\nbeneficial. The king’s strength is also shown in his dealings with the\r\nfour knights who had murdered the archbishop; a weaker man would almost\r\ncertainly have sacrificed the murderers to appease public opinion, but\r\nHenry, admitting that they had acted on his behalf though not in accord\r\nwith his intentions, took no action against them, possibly not sorry to\r\nlet ecclesiastical claims reduce themselves to a logical absurdity by\r\nshowing that the Church could only deal with the ecclesiastical offence\r\nof the murder of an archbishop by the ineffective method of\r\nexcommunication.\r\n\r\nThe young King Henry was present at the ceremony at Avranches and joined\r\nwith his father in swearing to obey the terms imposed, so far as they\r\nwere not personal to the elder king; but it would seem that the\r\nrepresentatives of France and other important personages were absent,\r\nand it was therefore arranged that the ceremony should be repeated at a\r\nlater date at Caen. The absolution was duly repeated about Michaelmas,\r\nbut whether at Caen or again at Avranches is not quite clear. Meanwhile\r\nHenry had arranged for the deferred coronation of his son’s wife\r\nMargaret, the daughter of King Louis. It has already been mentioned\r\nthat, much to her father’s anger, she had not been crowned with her\r\nhusband, but it would seem that Henry had had the genuine intention of\r\nallowing her to be crowned subsequently. He appears to have promised\r\nBecket that he should officiate, and it may have been for this purpose\r\nthat Margaret crossed over to England in September 1170. She remained at\r\nWinchester until 3rd April 1171, when she crossed again to Normandy, and\r\nwas no doubt with her husband at Christmas that year, when the young\r\nHenry held his court at Bur-le-Roi, to which flocked the chivalry in\r\nsuch numbers that it is recorded that in one hall there dined together a\r\nhundred and three knights whose Christian name was William. In August\r\n1172 Margaret and her husband went back to England, and on the 27th of\r\nthat month they were crowned together in Winchester Cathedral by Rotrou,\r\nArchbishop of Rouen, and the Bishops of Evreux and Worcester. Their stay\r\nwas not of long duration, as early in November they were summoned back\r\nto Normandy by the old king. They obeyed unwillingly, but instead of\r\njoining the English court paid a visit to King Louis, who seized the\r\nopportunity to urge upon the young Henry that he should demand from his\r\nfather the complete sovereignty of either England or Normandy, or at any\r\nrate something more substantial than the shadowy royalty which he had\r\nhitherto enjoyed. The counsel fell on willing ears; the prince had long\r\nsmarted under his father’s strict control and the surveillance of\r\nministers who were practically his masters, and he was in no mind to\r\nremain a king without a kingdom and without even a sufficient income.\r\n\r\nAfter Christmas, which the young king and his queen kept at Bonneville\r\nwhile the elder Henry and Eleanor were at Chinon, the two Henrys went to\r\nMontferrand and afterwards to Limoges to negotiate for the marriage of\r\nJohn, now six years old, with Alais, daughter and heir of the powerful\r\nCount Hubert of Maurienne, lord of Savoy. The count undertook to make a\r\nmost liberal provision for the young couple, but when it came to Henry’s\r\nturn to fix what he would bestow upon them he named the castellanies of\r\nChinon, Loudun, and Mirabeau. The young Henry at once indignantly\r\nprotested that these castles belonged to him as Count of Anjou, and\r\nabsolutely declined to make them over to his brother. This, combined\r\nwith his father’s action in refusing to increase either his power or his\r\nallowance and in removing from his company certain young men of bad\r\ninfluence, roused the young king’s resentment, which was sedulously\r\nfanned by his mother, Queen Eleanor. The latter, egged on by her uncle,\r\nRalph de Faye, urged her son to open rebellion, and afterwards\r\npersuaded his brothers, Richard and Geoffrey, to join him in opposition\r\nto their father. At last, on 5th March, the young king slipped away, and\r\nevading pursuit reached the court of Louis.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion thus begun bore a formidable aspect and seemed to have\r\nevery prospect of success. Young Henry was an admirable centre for the\r\nconcentration of the disaffected. Tall, remarkably handsome, and adding\r\nto his father’s charm of manner an open-handed liberality which the\r\nelder Henry lacked, he was already earning the reputation which he\r\nestablished a few years later as the flower of chivalry, while his\r\napparently complete lack of solid qualities in no way detracted from his\r\npopularity. In the struggle with his father he could of course count\r\nupon the assistance of King Louis, and though that king was singularly\r\nincompetent his resources were very considerable. The more lawless\r\nEnglish lords, whose wings had been clipped by Henry’s anti-feudal\r\nlegislation, might also be counted upon; and in this category were old\r\nHugh Bigot, Earl of Norfolk, the other Earl Hugh, he of Chester, the\r\nyoung Earl of Leicester, son of the loyal justiciar who had died in\r\n1168, Earl Ferrers of Derby, and Roger Mowbray. The discontented lords\r\nwhose lands lay within Henry’s continental domains were still more\r\nnumerous, and included the Counts of Ponthieu, Evreux, Eu, and Meulan,\r\nWilliam de Tancarville, chamberlain of Normandy, and Geoffrey and Guy de\r\nLusignan. Amongst those who seem to have supported the young king out\r\nof affection for him rather than out of hatred of his father were\r\nWilliam Marshal, younger son of Becket’s adversary and one of the most\r\nbrilliant knights of his time, Hasculf de Saint Hilaire, Robert Tregoz,\r\nand William de Dives. Further important allies were secured by\r\nrecklessly liberal promises of reward: to Count Philip of Flanders young\r\nHenry promised the county of Kent with the castles of Dover and\r\nRochester and £1000 of rent; to his brother, the Count of Boulogne, the\r\ncounty of Mortain and other lands; to Theobald, Count of Blois, the\r\ncastle of Amboise and £500 of rents from Anjou; and a little later, when\r\nthe unsatisfactory state of affairs in Normandy rendered desirable a\r\ndiversion in England, Westmoreland with Carlisle and possibly also\r\nNorthumberland were offered to King William of Scotland, while to his\r\nbrother David the earldom of Huntingdon and Cambridge was granted.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, though his continental domains were seething with\r\ndiscontent, King Henry could count upon powerful support from the\r\nEnglish magnates. The Earls of Cornwall, Surrey, Arundel, Essex,\r\nNorthampton, and Salisbury could be relied upon; Richard “Strongbow” of\r\nPembroke was loyal, though too much engaged with affairs in Ireland to\r\nbe of much assistance; and William of Gloucester, though married to the\r\nyoung Earl of Leicester’s sister, would be at worst neutral. The best\r\npart of the baronage, headed by the great justiciar, Richard de Luci,\r\n“the Loyal,” were to be depended upon, and included men of the military\r\nability of Humphrey de Bohun, Robert de Stuteville, William de Vesci,\r\nand Odinell de Umfraville. The kings of Wales, David ap Owain and the\r\nredoubtable Rhys ap Gruffudd, with their hardy warriors, were also\r\nallies not to be despised. The valuable support of the Church was also,\r\ncontrary to what might have been expected, strongly on the elder king’s\r\nside, the only conspicuous exceptions being the Bishop of Durham and,\r\ncuriously enough, Henry’s former ardent partisan, Arnulf of Lisieux. To\r\nfurther strengthen his position Henry now filled up the six vacant\r\nEnglish bishoprics, taking the opportunity to promote his faithful\r\narchdeacons; Richard of Ilchester, Archdeacon of Poictiers, receiving\r\nthe see of Winchester, Geoffrey Ridel of Canterbury that of Ely, and\r\nReynold, Archdeacon of Salisbury, that of Bath; Robert Foliot,\r\nArchdeacon of Lincoln and brother of the Bishop of London, obtained\r\nHereford, Joscelin was promoted from the deanery to the bishopric of\r\nChichester, and the great see of Lincoln was bestowed upon the king’s\r\nillegitimate son Geoffrey. In this manner Henry showed his obedience to\r\nthe papal demand that the vacant sees should be filled, and at the same\r\ntime he obtained practical control of the episcopal bench. The primacy\r\nwas for a time left unfilled, owing to disputes between the monks of\r\nCanterbury and the bishops of the province, and to other causes; but in\r\nJune, Richard, Prior of Dover, was elected by general consent, and, by\r\na happy coincidence, on the day of his election there arrived a letter\r\nfrom the pope announcing that the martyred Thomas of Canterbury had been\r\nenrolled amongst the saints.\r\n\r\nThanks to his wise policy in encouraging the trading and mercantile\r\ncommunities and in protecting the small men from the oppression of the\r\ngreat, Henry had on his side the bulk of the populace and especially the\r\ncitizens of London, Rouen, and the other great towns. Finally, he had\r\ngreat financial resources, and it was this abundance of money that\r\nturned the scale in his favour by enabling him not only to hire large\r\nnumbers of mercenaries but also to buy off many of the French nobles who\r\nwere supposed to be supporting his rebellious sons.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was clear that his son had fled to raise the standard of\r\nrebellion Henry proceeded to Gisors and set that and his other frontier\r\ncastles in a state of defence. While he was so doing a rumour reached\r\nthe rebels that he was advancing to attack them and they at once\r\nprepared for battle. The young king had not yet been knighted, his\r\nfather having intended that King Louis should bestow the dignity upon\r\nhim; but feeling that it would befit his position as leader of the army\r\nhe now hastily sought the honour of knighthood at the hands of his\r\nfaithful comrade and instructor in the art of arms, William Marshal. The\r\nalarm proved false; Henry, so far from attacking, retired to Rouen,\r\nwhere he spent the greater part of the next four months hunting and\r\napparently ignoring the outbreak, but really keeping a watchful eye upon\r\nevents and waiting the opportunity to strike a crushing blow.\r\n\r\nAbout the last week in June Henry appears to have made a hurried visit\r\nto England, going straight to Northampton, spending four days there, and\r\nthen returning at once to Rouen.[32] Affairs in England were calculated\r\nto give rise to some anxiety. Although so many castles had been thrown\r\ndown or taken into the king’s hand since the beginning of his reign a\r\nconsiderable number still remained in private hands, and of these at\r\nleast a score were now held for the rebels. On the east coast Hugh Bigot\r\nheld Framlingham and Bungay; in the Midlands, Huntingdon was held for\r\nDavid of Scotland; the Earl of Leicester had Leicester, Mountsorel, and\r\nGroby; the Earl Ferrers Tutbury and Duffield; while Chester was held for\r\nEarl Hugh. In the north the Bishop of Durham had fortified Durham,\r\nNorham, and Northallerton, and Mowbray held Thirsk, Malzeard, and\r\nAxholme; Hamo de Masci had castles at Dunham and Ullerwood, Geoffrey de\r\nCostantin at Stockport, and Richard de Morville at Lauder, and there\r\nwere a number of smaller fortresses which might prove centres of\r\ndanger. The castles in the hands of the king and his supporters must\r\nhave been at least five times as numerous, and the royal officers\r\nspeedily set in order those in the districts most likely to be\r\naffected--the south-east, exposed to the raids of Flemish and French,\r\nand the north, where the Scots were to be feared. Porchester,\r\nSouthampton, and Winchester were strengthened, so were Arundel,\r\nChichester, and Hastings; in Kent much money was spent on the castles of\r\nDover, Canterbury, Rochester, and Chilham; the Tower of London was of\r\ncourse a centre of activity; at Oreford the outer defences were\r\nstrengthened; Walton, Colchester, and Norwich were garrisoned; so were\r\nHertford, Cambridge, Wisbeach, and Lincoln. Windsor, Oxford,\r\nBerkhamstead, Wallingford, Kenilworth, Warwick, Worcester, Nottingham,\r\nand the Peak carried the chain of royal strongholds across the country,\r\nwhile in the north were York, Bowes, Richmond, Carlisle, Prudhoe,\r\nAppleby, Wark, and Newcastle. For the present the chief centre of danger\r\nseemed to be Leicester, and it was no doubt as a result of the king’s\r\nflying visit to Northampton that operations were set on foot early in\r\nJuly against Leicester.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that Henry returned to Rouen, on 29th June, Count Philip\r\nof Flanders captured Aumâle, probably by the connivance of its defender,\r\nCount William of Aumâle, and, after a more energetic resistance, the\r\ncastle of Driencourt. This last success, however, was neutralised by the\r\ndeath of Philip’s brother, Count Matthew of Boulogne. Meanwhile the\r\nFrench army under King Louis and the young King Henry was vainly\r\nbesieging Verneuil. Hugh de Lacy and Hugh de Beauchamp, who were in\r\ncommand of the defence, had no difficulty in repelling their attacks,\r\nbut after a month’s siege provisions ran short in the outermost of the\r\nthree “bourgs” into which the town was divided, and the inhabitants\r\nagreed that if they were not relieved before 9th August they would\r\nsurrender, the French on their side swearing to do them no harm. Henry,\r\nrealising that instant action was necessary, advanced at once, burning\r\nthe Earl of Leicester’s abandoned castle of Breteuil on the way. When\r\nthe two armies were in sight of one another on 8th August Louis sent\r\nenvoys and obtained a truce until the next day, and Henry, not\r\nsuspecting his good faith, retired to Conches. Next day Louis demanded\r\nthe surrender of the bourg in accordance with the former agreement, and\r\nat once treacherously set it on fire and, adding cowardice to treachery,\r\nfled back to France, hotly pursued with great slaughter by Henry. The\r\ncentre of action now shifted to Brittany, where the turbulent Breton\r\nnobles had risen under Ralph of Fougères and the Earl of Chester.\r\nAgainst them Henry sent a strong force of Brabantine mercenaries under\r\nWilliam de Humez, who inflicted a very severe defeat on the rebels,\r\ncapturing Hasculf de Saint Hilaire, William Patrie and others, and\r\ndriving the remainder of the force into the castle of Dol. A messenger\r\nwas sent off at full gallop to Henry at Rouen, and by an almost\r\nincredibly rapid forced march he covered the whole distance from Rouen\r\nto Dol, over 150 miles, in two days.[33] Earl Hugh and Ralph of\r\nFougères, seeing that resistance was hopeless, surrendered on 29th\r\nAugust, and by this single stroke eighty persons of rank and position\r\nand a number of men of lesser estate were captured and the rebellion in\r\nBrittany stamped out. The time now seemed ripe for a reconciliation, and\r\non 25th September Henry met his three sons and King Louis near Gisors.\r\nThe terms offered by the king to his sons were liberal in the extreme,\r\nbut the French king had no wish to see peace restored and he persuaded\r\nthem to reject the terms. The Earl of Leicester also, who had all\r\narrangements made for an invasion of England, did his insolent best to\r\nkeep the quarrel alive.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that early in July preparations had been made for the siege\r\nof Leicester. On the 22nd of that month the town surrendered to the Earl\r\nof Cornwall and Richard de Luci; the inhabitants were allowed to\r\nwithdraw to St. Albans and other places of refuge and the town was set\r\non fire. The castle, however, still held out, and in September news from\r\nthe north caused the siege to be raised. King William of Scotland,\r\nhaving vainly offered his services to the elder Henry in return for a\r\ngrant of Northumberland, accepted the younger Henry’s promise of\r\nWestmoreland and assembled a large army to reduce the northern counties.\r\nHis first move was against the castle of Wark, where Roger de Stuteville\r\nwas in command; Roger obtained a truce of forty days and the Scottish\r\narmy passed on, ravaging and burning as they went, and after an\r\nineffectual attack on William de Vesci’s castle of Alnwick captured\r\nWarkworth Castle. Newcastle, held for the king by Roger Fitz-Richard,\r\nLord of Warkworth, proved too strong for the invaders, and their efforts\r\nwere next directed against Carlisle. Here Robert de Vaux made a gallant\r\ndefence, and news arriving of the advance of the English relieving force\r\nthe Scots retreated to Roxburgh in full flight. Richard de Luci, with\r\nthe troops he had brought from Leicester, and Humphrey de Bohun, with a\r\ndetachment of mercenary cavalry, pursued them across the border and\r\nburnt Berwick. But news reached them that the Earl of Leicester had\r\nlanded with a force of Flemings at Walton on 29th September. Bohun at\r\nonce turned southwards, while Luci negotiated with the Scottish king\r\nbefore the news of Leicester’s landing could reach the latter. A truce\r\nwas obtained to last until January, and by the Bishop of Durham’s\r\nmediation this was afterwards extended to April 1174.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Leicester, on landing, had spent four days in a fruitless\r\nendeavour to capture Walton Castle, but finding it too strong to be\r\ntaken, although Earl Hugh of Norfolk had brought a siege train to his\r\nassistance, he turned aside and attacked Haughley. This fortress, held\r\nby Ranulph de Broc, Becket’s old adversary, was speedily captured and\r\ngiven to the flames, and then the earl’s initiative appears to have died\r\nout and he was content to quarter himself idly at Framlingham until Earl\r\nHugh gave him a strong hint that he was outstaying his welcome. At last\r\nhe decided to try and reach Leicester, and on 17th October he started,\r\nwith the intention of passing to the north of Bury St. Edmunds. At the\r\nlatter town the royalists, under Humphrey de Bohun, had been reinforced\r\nby troops under the Earls of Cornwall and Arundel, local levies under\r\nRoger le Bigod, the loyal son of old Earl Hugh, and Hugh de Cressi, and\r\na detachment of hardy fighting men from Ireland. Setting out with St.\r\nEdmund’s banner at their head they came upon the Flemings at Fornham-St.\r\nGeneveve. In actual numbers the advantage lay with the Earl of\r\nLeicester, but his followers were almost entirely infantry of poor\r\nquality, quite unfitted to cope with the powerful cavalry opposed to\r\nthem, and it was only a matter of minutes before the Flemings had been\r\nridden down and scattered, a prey for the country people, who bore them\r\nno good-will. Earl Robert and his cousin, Hugh de Chastel, were\r\ncaptured, and the gallant Countess Peronelle, clad in mail, falling into\r\na stream in her flight, was with difficulty rescued from a death which\r\nshe preferred to the disgrace of surrender. A halt was now made and\r\nforces collected to crush Earl Hugh, but with the aid of his wealth he\r\nbought a truce for himself and permission for the Flemish mercenaries\r\nstill in England to leave the country unharmed.\r\n\r\nHenry, having seen the captured earl and countess safely lodged in the\r\ncastle of Falaise, led an army into Anjou in November and captured\r\nPreuilly, La Haye, and Champigny with a large number of men of rank. The\r\nyear 1173 thus ended favourably for the elder king, and truces with the\r\nkings of France and Scotland ensured peace until the close of Easter,\r\n31st March 1174. But with the beginning of April the struggle began\r\nagain. The Scottish king crossed the border and besieged Wark, raiding\r\nas far as Bamborough, where William de Vesci’s castle proved too strong\r\nto be attacked. Roger de Stuteville offered a vigorous defence, and the\r\nbesiegers’ artillery proving more deadly to themselves than to the\r\ngarrison, King William abandoned the siege of Wark and concentrated his\r\nefforts on Carlisle. He had been joined by Roger Mowbray and Adam de\r\nPort, a Norman baron who had been banished and deprived of his English\r\nestates in 1172 for conspiring against Henry, and his army included the\r\ninevitable execrated Flemish mercenaries. Ruthless as these Flemish\r\nadventurers were, they were less inhuman than the savage Highlanders and\r\nmen of Galloway who accompanied them. From Carlisle plundering bands\r\nravaged and destroyed the northern counties, while more warlike\r\nexpeditions captured the border forts of Liddel and Harbottle. Far more\r\nserious was the tame surrender of Appleby Castle: the aged Gospatric,\r\nson of Orm, the English constable of the castle, was possibly too old\r\nfor his responsible position, and his lack of confidence would seem to\r\nhave affected the garrison, amongst whom were the steward of Hugh de\r\nMorville, the murderer of Becket, and one John de Morville, probably\r\nconnections of Richard de Morville, who was a prominent supporter of the\r\nScottish king. This success was followed up by the capture, after a\r\ndesperate resistance, of Brough-under-Stanemore, and the general trend\r\nof affairs induced Robert de Vaux to obtain a truce for Carlisle on\r\nundertaking to surrender at Michaelmas if not relieved before that date.\r\n\r\nHenry, after assuring himself of the loyalty of Maine and Anjou in the\r\nspring of 1174, had entered Poitou and inflicted a crushing defeat on\r\nthe troops of his son Richard at Saintes in May. Messages had been\r\nreaching him for some time past from the justiciar, who was besieging\r\nHuntingdon, urging his return to England, and on his arrival at\r\nBonneville in Normandy on 24th June he was met by Richard of Ilchester,\r\nbishop-elect of Winchester, with news of the gravity of affairs. There\r\nwas no mistaking the significance of the selection of Richard--“they\r\ncould not have sent a more urgent messenger, unless they had sent the\r\nTower of London”--and Henry at once prepared to cross to England. He\r\naccordingly embarked at Barfleur on 7th July, and being determined to\r\nleave no centres of disaffection behind him, he carried with him the\r\nEarls of Chester and Leicester, Queen Eleanor, who had been captured the\r\nprevious year trying to reach the French court in male disguise, and\r\nQueen Margaret. The weather was stormy but the wind was in the right\r\ndirection, and Henry bade the shipmen set sail, saying solemnly, “If\r\nwhat I purpose is for the peace of Church and people, and if the King of\r\nHeaven has decreed that peace shall be restored by my coming, then in\r\nHis mercy may He grant me a safe passage. But if He has turned His face\r\nfrom me and has decreed to afflict the kingdom with a rod, then may it\r\nnever be mine to set foot on shore.” The voyage to Southampton was\r\naccomplished in safety, and Henry at once proceeded, fasting and with\r\nall signs of humility, to Canterbury, where on 12th July he performed\r\npublic penance at the tomb of St. Thomas. The Bishop of London delivered\r\nan address on the king’s behalf, disavowing all share in the murder, but\r\nadmitting that his rash words had been the actual cause of it; then,\r\nafter long remaining in prayer at the tomb, the king submitted to a\r\nceremonial scourging at the hands of all the monks of the convent of\r\nChrist Church. Finally he made a grant of lands to the monastery in\r\nmemory of the martyr, and probably at the same time settled a small\r\nincome upon Becket’s married sister, Roese,[34] his other sister, Mary,\r\nhaving been appointed in the previous year Abbess of Berking.\r\n\r\nThe news of Henry’s landing put an end to the plans of the younger king\r\nfor an invasion of England, which he had contemplated in company with\r\nPhilip of Flanders. He had even gone so far as to send over three\r\nhundred picked Flemish knights under Ralph de la Haye in June. They had\r\nlanded at Orewell, placed themselves under the command of Earl Hugh of\r\nNorfolk, and, after being repulsed from Dunwich, had captured the\r\nwealthy city of Norwich by treachery and gained thereby great plunder if\r\nlittle military advantage. This occurred on 18th June, and the news\r\napparently caused the justiciar to relinquish the siege of Huntingdon,\r\nleaving Earl Simon of Northampton, who claimed the earldom of\r\nHuntingdon, to win the castle and the county for himself. As we have\r\nalready seen an urgent message was despatched to the king, and about the\r\nsame time Robert de Vaux obtained conditions for Carlisle. The Scottish\r\narmy being thus set free for fresh enterprises Roger Mowbray urged King\r\nWilliam to move southwards to his assistance, his strongholds of Axholme\r\nand Malzeard having fallen before the troops of Geoffrey, the king’s\r\nillegitimate son, the young bishop-elect of Lincoln, and Thirsk being\r\nthreatened. William preferred the less hazardous course of keeping near\r\nhis own borders, and laid siege to Odinal de Umfraville’s castle of\r\nPrudhoe. The castle was strong and well provisioned, and Odinal\r\nsucceeded in getting away to raise forces for its relief. Preparing to\r\nretreat into his own country, the Scottish king sent detachments of his\r\narmy under Earl Duncan, the Earl of Angus, and Richard de Morville to\r\nravage the country, while he with a small body of knights made a\r\ndemonstration against Alnwick. The English forces under Ranulf de\r\nGlanvill, Odinal de Umfraville, Robert de Stuteville, William de Vesci,\r\nand Bernard de Baillol left Newcastle at daybreak on 13th July, and,\r\nfavoured by a mist, surprised King William and his attendants close to\r\nAlnwick. William the Lion did not surrender tamely, but, mounting his\r\nhorse, led his men against the foe. The odds were too heavy, however;\r\nthe king’s charger was killed and he himself pinned to the ground by its\r\nfall, Roger de Mowbray and Adam de Port fled for safety, but the\r\nScottish knights fought for their lord so long as resistance was\r\npossible. Thus on the day, possibly even at the hour, on which Henry\r\ncompleted his penance at the tomb of St. Thomas his most dangerous\r\nopponent was made prisoner. The good news was despatched at once by a\r\nmounted messenger, who found Henry resting at London, where he had had a\r\nmost enthusiastic reception upon his arrival. The king, who was unwell,\r\nwas asleep, but the messenger would brook no delay, and the news of\r\nWilliam’s capture, which Henry could at first hardly believe, proved\r\ngood medicine for the sick man. The nobles at court were at once told\r\nthe news, and next day\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEAL OF WILLIAM THE LION (1/1)]\r\n\r\nall the bells of London’s six score churches rang in joy that the\r\nrebellion in England was at an end.\r\n\r\nA few days later the king advanced to Huntingdon, which surrendered to\r\nhim on 21st July. He then turned to attack Earl Hugh’s castle of\r\nFramlingham, and by the 24th had advanced with his siege train as far as\r\nSeleham; but next day the earl met him there, gave up his castles of\r\nBungay and Framlingham, and agreed to pay a heavy fine for his offence\r\nand to make amends for the damage wrought by his soldiers; he was at\r\nonce restored to his earldom, and his Flemish troops were permitted to\r\nleave the country unmolested, but not to take any property with them.\r\nDuring this interview, which took place on horseback in the open air,\r\nthe king was kicked on the leg by the horse of Tostes de St. Omer, a\r\nTemplar of prominence, but the injury did not prevent his going on to\r\nNorthampton, where the last act of the rebellion in England was played.\r\nBishop Hugh Puiset, who had brought over a detachment of Flemings under\r\ncommand of his nephew, the Count of Bar, on the very day on which the\r\nScottish king was captured, had sent back the infantry at once, but had\r\nretained his nephew and his men-at-arms until the fortune of war had set\r\ndefinitely in Henry’s favour; he now made submission, gave up his\r\ncastles of Durham, Northallerton, and Norham, and dismissed his foreign\r\nallies. The Earl of Clare, who was believed to have been plotting action\r\nwith Gilbert Munfichet when the latter fortified his London castle,\r\ntendered assurances of loyalty. Roger Mowbray surrendered Thirsk;\r\nAnsketil Malory, who had defended Leicester so well, and had even\r\nattacked and defeated the loyalists at Northampton, gave up his master’s\r\ncastles of Leicester, Groby, and Mountsorel; and Earl Ferrers, who not\r\nlong before had sacked Nottingham, gave up Tutbury, which had been\r\nbesieged for some time past by Rhys and his Welshmen. Rhys was rewarded\r\nby a grant of the castle and district of “Emelin,” while the loyalty of\r\nDavid ap Owain of North Wales was recompensed by the hand of Emma, King\r\nHenry’s half-sister.\r\n\r\nAlthough affairs in England had been settled so satisfactorily there was\r\nno time to be lost; taking advantage of Henry’s absence King Louis had\r\npressed forward with the young King Henry and invested Rouen. The town\r\nwas devoted to the elder Henry’s interests; it was well provisioned and\r\nwas in no great danger, but it was clearly desirable that it should be\r\nrelieved as soon as possible, and on 8th August Henry sailed for\r\nBarfleur, carrying his more important prisoners with him and taking back\r\nnot only the Brabantine mercenaries he had brought over in June but also\r\na number of Welsh troops. These latter on 12th August, the day after\r\ntheir arrival at Rouen, crossed the Seine and made a bold and successful\r\nraid on the French camp, and next day a sally from the town resulted in\r\nthe easy destruction of the defensive works of the besiegers’ camp. When\r\nthe war had opened just a year before, in August 1173, with the siege\r\nof Verneuil, Louis had shown a blend of treachery, cowardice, and\r\nincompetence, and now that the war was closing with this siege of Rouen\r\nhis conduct displayed the same features. Just before Henry’s arrival, on\r\nSt. Laurence’s Day (10th August), the French king had declared a truce\r\nin honour of the saint and then made secret preparations for storming\r\nthe city; fortunately some priests, who happened to be on the belfry\r\nlooking at the view, saw the movement in the enemy’s camp and rang the\r\ntocsin; the citizens flew to arms, and the French took therefrom no\r\nadvantage but dishonour and disgrace. On the day after the successful\r\nsally the French burnt their siege engines and fled, Louis staving off\r\npursuit by proposing a conference at Malannai next day, but again\r\nbreaking his word and flying into France.\r\n\r\nNegotiations were opened on 8th September at Gisors, but as Richard was\r\nstill defying his father in Poitou a settlement was postponed and Henry\r\nwent in pursuit of his warlike son. A couple of weeks sufficed to bring\r\nRichard to terms, and on the last day of September conditions of peace\r\nwere drawn up. The followers of the young king were released from the\r\nallegiance they had sworn to him, and were received back into the king’s\r\nfavour and as full possession of their lands as they had at the time war\r\nbroke out; prisoners were released without ransom, except such as had\r\nalready come to terms and also excepting the King of Scotland, the\r\nEarls of Leicester and Chester, and Ralph of Fougères; all castles that\r\nhad been built or strengthened during the rebellion were to be restored\r\nto their former condition, and, indeed, so far as possible everything\r\nwas to resume its previous existence. The young King Henry was granted\r\ntwo castles in Normandy and a yearly allowance of £15,000 Angevin money\r\n(£3600 English); Richard should have two castles of no strategic\r\nimportance in Poitou and half the revenues of that province, and\r\nGeoffrey half the inheritance of Constance, daughter of Count Conan of\r\nBrittany, and the whole when he married her. At the same time the young\r\nking agreed to the bestowal upon his youngest brother, John, of the\r\ncastles of Nottingham and Marlborough, and £1000 from the English\r\nrevenues, as well as castles and rents in Normandy, Anjou, and Maine.\r\nRichard and Geoffrey then did homage to their father, but this ceremony\r\nwas dispensed with in Henry’s case out of deference to his rank of king.\r\nFinally, in December, King William the Lion obtained his release from\r\nthe prison at Falaise by becoming the vassal of Henry and undertaking to\r\nhold Scotland under the English king. To ensure the fulfilment of this\r\ntreaty the castles of Edinburgh, Roxburgh, Berwick, Jedburgh, and\r\nStirling were surrendered to Henry. The close of 1174 thus found Henry\r\ncompletely triumphant and the formidable combination of his enemies\r\nabsolutely shattered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEALS OF GEOFFREY, SON OF HENRY II, AND CONSTANCE OF\r\nBRITTANY, HIS WIFE (1/1)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nHENRY AND HIS SONS--HIS DOWNFALL AND DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe economic effects of the rebellion were far-reaching. Those who had\r\nbeen involved in it returned, it is true, nominally to the position in\r\nwhich they had been before the outbreak, but their lands had been\r\nsystematically ravaged, their castles given to the flames, and blackened\r\nruins told for a generation the tale of their disastrous failure. So far\r\nas England was concerned these effects were more localised and less\r\nextensive. During the war Mowbray’s castles of Kirkby Malzeard and\r\nAxholme had been destroyed, and at its close the same fate befell\r\nThirsk. Thetford and Brackley and the two Kentish castles of Allington\r\nand Saltwood had been dismantled before the end of 1174, and so had\r\nGeoffrey de Turville’s castle of Weston. Next year saw the overthrow of\r\nGroby and Tutbury; Dudley, the castle of Earl Ferrers’ son-in-law,\r\nGervase Painel, was razed and its owner fined 500 marks for his share in\r\nthe revolt, his neighbour and comrade in arms, Hamo de Masci, being at\r\nthe same time fined 300 marks. The strongholds of Huntingdon and\r\nLeicester were rendered incapable of again resisting the king’s forces,\r\nand the great English military architect and engineer, Ælnoth, came down\r\nto supervise the levelling of the walls of Framlingham Castle and the\r\nfilling of its fosse. For strategic reasons the fort at Walton, which\r\nhad successfully resisted the Flemish invaders, was destroyed in 1176,\r\nand also the keep of Bennington, and the Bishop of Durham only saved his\r\ncastle of Northallerton by a payment of 2000 marks. What other castles\r\ndisappeared we do not know, but such as remained were taken into the\r\nking’s hands, the Earl of Gloucester yielding Bristol and Gloucester\r\nwith great reluctance.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the war must have strained Henry’s finances severely.\r\nFor the expeditions on the Scottish border alone we know that Ranulph de\r\nGlanville and Robert de Stuteville paid over £2000 to their troops, and\r\nthe cost of the mercenaries employed on the Continent must have been\r\nvery heavy. A large but quite uncertain sum must have been obtained from\r\nthe ransom of the many important prisoners taken, and further\r\ncontributions were levied in the form of fines. The Earl of Leicester\r\nwas impleaded by Bertram de Verdon, Sheriff of Leicestershire, for\r\ninjuries done by his men and fined 500 marks. Nine citizens of York who\r\nhad sided with the rebels were fined 1300 marks between them, several of\r\nthem being also fined smaller sums for receiving goods belonging to\r\nFlemings. These latter had been banished from England, saving their\r\nlives at the expense of their property, and the township of Selby was\r\nfined £5 for allowing Flemings to carry away their goods, William of\r\nSelby 5 marks for not detaining Flemings whom he saw pass through the\r\ntown, and Fulk of Selby £10 for hiring his ship to the Flemings. For the\r\nmost part these foreigners were clothworkers, and their forfeited\r\nproperty, consisting chiefly of wool, did not yield any great sum. A\r\nmore fruitful source of income arose from the estates of the Earl of\r\nLeicester and his companions during the time that they were in arms\r\nagainst the king, and from these only about £300 were obtained between\r\nSeptember 1174 and the restoration of the estates to their owners. Apart\r\nfrom the 2600 marks assessed upon the citizens of York, the Earl of\r\nLeicester, Gervase Painel, and Hamo de Masci, £500 was raised by smaller\r\nfines upon persons who had sold horses or armour or given other\r\nassistance to the rebels. Even adding in Earl Hugh’s fine of 700 marks\r\nand the 500 marks which Gospatric was fined for the surrender of\r\nAppleby, the total amount accounted for at the exchequer as wrung from\r\nthe vanquished party seems to have fallen far short of £4000. Searching\r\nfor some device to fill his empty coffers Henry hit upon the idea of\r\nvigorously punishing all offences against the Forest Laws which had been\r\ncommitted during the time of the disturbances. Accordingly, in August\r\n1175, he held pleas of the forest at Nottingham and afterwards at York\r\nin person and sent special commissioners to hold similar pleas in other\r\ncounties. The baronage protested, and Richard de Luci produced the\r\nking’s own writ issued at the time of the war, apparently suspending the\r\nForest Laws and authorising any person to take wood and venison in the\r\nroyal forests. It is as difficult to understand why Henry issued such a\r\nwrit as it is to see upon what grounds he set it aside. Possibly a writ\r\nintended to apply to certain special cases, such as the taking of\r\nvenison for the provisioning of the royal troops or of timber for\r\nmilitary works, had by a misunderstanding or error of wording been made\r\nto apply generally, and Henry declined to accept responsibility for the\r\nmistake. However this may be, it is clear that his action in pressing\r\nthese pleas was at least a piece of sharp practice, and the heavy fines\r\nexacted can hardly be regarded in the circumstances as anything but\r\nextortion. The sum of the fines inflicted appears to have been £13,450,\r\nand although much of this was not paid at once and some was in the end\r\nremitted, the eventual yield seems to have been quite £10,000. About\r\n1700 persons were amerced; and when it is remembered that to these must\r\nbe added a large number of cases in which whole townships were fined, it\r\nis clear that the total number of persons affected must have been very\r\nlarge. A few fortunate counties, such as Kent, Sussex, Norfolk, and\r\nSuffolk, contained no royal forests, but elsewhere every class of man\r\nwas swept into the legal net, from the great baron to the villein and\r\nincluding the clergy. Henry had indeed succeeded in wringing from the\r\npapal legate, Cardinal Ugoccione, the concession that the clergy should\r\nbe subject to the Forest Laws.\r\n\r\nThe legate had been sent over to settle the rival claims of the sees of\r\nCanterbury and York, but his arrival only tended to aggravate matters.\r\nAt a synod held at Westminster on 18th March 1176, the endeavours of\r\nArchbishop Roger of York to oust Richard of Canterbury from his seat of\r\nhonour on the legate’s right hand led to a disgraceful scuffle, in which\r\nArchbishop Roger was attacked by the supporters of the southern primate,\r\nknocked down, and in the end ignominiously ejected from the chapel. The\r\nlegate indignantly dismissed the synod and was with difficulty persuaded\r\nto retain his official position. In July he left England, having\r\naccomplished practically nothing in the matter of the rival sees. If\r\npopular rumour was correct in believing that he had been sounded by\r\nHenry on the question of a divorce from Queen Eleanor, in this matter\r\nalso there had been no result. The one important result of his visit had\r\nbeen that the clergy were for the future to be subject to the Forest\r\nLaws and also to plead in the king’s court in matters touching lay fees.\r\nIt is said that by way of compensation Henry recognised their exemption\r\nfrom lay jurisdiction in all other matters, agreed not to make a\r\npractice of retaining vacant bishoprics and abbeys in his hands, and\r\ngranted that the murder of a clerk should be punished by forfeiture.\r\nEven if these concessions were made they were far from reconciling those\r\nof the clerical party who still held Becket’s ideal of the supremacy of\r\nthe Church.\r\n\r\nRestored to favour with the pope and victorious over as formidable a\r\ncombination of his enemies as could well be formed against him, Henry\r\nwas now at the height of his power, recognised throughout Europe as a\r\nprince whose friendship was worth seeking. In his court at Westminster\r\non 12th November 1176, might have been seen ambassadors from the Emperor\r\nManuel of Constantinople, the Emperor Frederic, the Duke of Saxony, the\r\nCount of Flanders, and the Archbishop of Rheims. About the same time\r\nalso came a joint mission from the Kings of Castile and Navarre asking\r\nHenry to arbitrate between them in a dispute about certain castles and\r\nother territory. Accordingly, in the following March Henry heard the\r\narguments of the rival embassies and gave his decision after\r\nconsultation with the peers of his court, sentencing each side to make\r\nrestitution to the other and further condemning the King of Castile to\r\npay to Navarre 3000 maravedis a year for the next ten years. This King\r\nAlphonso of Castile had married Henry’s daughter Eleanor in 1170, and\r\nabout the time that the subject of this arbitration was first broached,\r\nat the end of 1176, another of Henry’s daughters, Joan, was on her way\r\nto marry King William of Sicily. Negotiations for the marriage had been\r\nopened earlier in the year, and after her\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEALS OF JOAN, DAUGHTER OF HENRY II (1/1)\r\n\r\n(Silver Matrix in B.M.)]\r\n\r\ntrousseaux had been bought in London, at a cost of over £100 (say £2500\r\nof modern money), she travelled through France with a brilliant retinue\r\nto St. Gilles, where she found awaiting her the Sicilian nobles and the\r\nBishop of Norwich. The unfortunate bishop had been sent on ahead earlier\r\nin the year to Sicily to make final arrangements and had had a very\r\nrough time; the country through which he passed was suffering from\r\nfamine and he could hardly get provisions for himself or his horse;\r\naccommodation sometimes failed completely, so that he had to sleep on\r\nthe rocks or sand of the seashore, and when he had a roof over his head\r\nhe found that the fleas had no reverence for his episcopal or\r\nambassadorial dignity, so that he was very pleased to complete his\r\nmission by handing the princess over to the Sicilians and to hurry back\r\nto England in time for the Christmas festivities at the court at\r\nNottingham.\r\n\r\nTwo other marriages occupied the king’s attention about this time. The\r\nyoung daughter of Count Hubert of Maurienne having died, Henry had to\r\nfind another heiress as bride for his favourite son John, and ultimately\r\ndecided that the great estates of the Earl of Gloucester would make a\r\nsuitable endowment for the landless prince. The earl had three\r\ndaughters, of whom two were already married to the Earl of Hertford and\r\nthe Count of Evreux, and Henry now prevailed upon the earl to agree that\r\nall his estates should be settled upon the remaining daughter, Isabel,\r\nand that she should be betrothed to John, for whom the king had also\r\nreserved the great estates of his uncle, Earl Reynold of Cornwall, upon\r\nthe latter’s death in 1175, with similar disregard for the rights of his\r\ndaughters and lawful heirs. Having settled this matter to his\r\nsatisfaction Henry next found himself confronted with the question of\r\nRichard’s matrimonial affairs. Richard had long been pledged to marry\r\nAlais, daughter of King Louis, and she had been, in accordance with the\r\nusual practice of the time, brought up at the court of her intended\r\nfather-in-law. She was now about twenty and the King of France was\r\npressing for the marriage to be performed, and in 1177 a papal legate\r\nwas despatched from Rome with instructions to lay Henry’s dominions\r\nunder an interdict if he should refuse to carry out the agreement. In\r\nAugust of that year Henry crossed to Normandy and next month met the\r\nlegate at Rouen, and on 21st September held a conference with King Louis\r\nat Ivry. At this conference the promise that Richard should marry Alais\r\nseems to have been renewed in an informal way, but Henry had no\r\nintention of fulfilling it, and indeed it seems probable that he was at\r\nthis time himself the lover of the princess, who had succeeded the\r\nfamous Rosamund Clifford in his affections when that beautiful favourite\r\ndied.[35]\r\n\r\nA more important effect of the conference at Ivry was the treaty then\r\ndrawn up between the two kings, composing their differences and agreeing\r\nto submit such points as still remained in dispute to arbitration, and\r\nalso agreeing to go together on crusade to the Holy Land. Henry probably\r\nnever had the slightest intention of going to Jerusalem; indeed to have\r\ndone so, leaving behind him such disloyal and unprincipled young\r\nscoundrels as his sons had proved themselves to be, would have been\r\nmadness, even if he had felt any particular interest in the fate of the\r\nHoly Land. It will be remembered that the terms upon which Henry was\r\nabsolved from the guilt of the murder of Becket had included the payment\r\nof a large sum for the support of the warriors in Palestine and his\r\npersonal participation in a crusade for three years. The first of these\r\nobligations he would seem to have discharged early in 1177, when the\r\nEarl of Essex and other English knights went with Count Philip of\r\nFlanders to the East, as William de Braose was sent “to carry the king’s\r\nalms to the Templars.” The three years’ crusade was commuted for the\r\nfoundation of three monasteries, and Henry, whose partiality for\r\nmonastic establishments was by no means marked, contrived to interpret\r\nthis obligation in a way consistent with the strictest economy. Finding\r\nthat the secular canons of Waltham had become remiss in the performance\r\nof their duties, he ejected them from their collegiate church, with the\r\nconnivance of their dean, Guy Rufus, and replaced them by canons\r\nregular of the Augustinian order. In the same way, finding the lives of\r\nthe nuns at Amesbury far from satisfactory, he turned them out,\r\npensioning off the abbess, and put in their place other nuns from the\r\nNorman abbey of Fontevrault. Both of these transformations took place in\r\nthe latter half of 1177, and for the next few years the work of\r\nrebuilding and enlarging at Waltham and Amesbury were carried on at the\r\nking’s expense on a fairly generous scale. The third monastery was a new\r\nfoundation, a small priory of Carthusians established at Witham in\r\nSomerset. It would seem that Henry brought over a few brethren from the\r\nfamous monastery of Chartreuse early in 1175, but gave them no\r\nassistance and took no further steps towards establishing them in\r\npermanent buildings. The first prior abandoned his post in despair and\r\nthe next died soon after his arrival at Witham; Henry then succeeded\r\nwith much difficulty in persuading the Prior of Chartreuse to send Hugh\r\nof Avalon, a monk of equal ability and piety; but when he came he had to\r\nendure the same heartbreaking round of delays, evasions, and unfulfilled\r\npromises, and it was not until about 1180, when Henry discovered the\r\ntrue worth and charm of his personality and became his close friend,\r\nthat the king made any endeavour to complete the priory of Witham. It\r\nwas characteristic of Henry that when the prior expressed his wish for a\r\ncopy of the Holy Scriptures for the use of his brethren, the king\r\ncompelled the monks of Winchester to give up an elaborately written\r\ncopy, which they had just completed for their own use, and presented it\r\nto the grateful monks of Witham. It was equally characteristic of Hugh\r\nthat, when he learnt how the precious volume had been provided, he\r\ninsisted upon returning it to its rightful owners.\r\n\r\nThe warm affection which the king lavished upon Hugh led many people to\r\nbelieve that the latter was Henry’s son, a belief strengthened by a\r\ncertain likeness observable between the two. And indeed the likeness was\r\nnot confined to physical traits, for Hugh, with all his piety and\r\nausterity, was quick-tempered and quick-witted and had as keen\r\nappreciation for a joke as had Henry himself, and fully realised that a\r\nwitty as well as a soft answer may turn away wrath. On one occasion,\r\nhaving incurred the king’s wrath by excommunicating one of his\r\nforesters, he was summoned to Woodstock and found Henry and his\r\ncourtiers sitting in a circle on the grass. To intimate his displeasure\r\nthe king ignored Hugh’s salutation and maintained a sulky silence, the\r\nattendant nobles following his example; Hugh calmly pushed aside an earl\r\nand sat down next to the king, who, incapable of resting idle, called\r\nfor a needle and thread and began to stitch a torn leather finger-stall\r\nwhich he was wearing on his left hand. Hugh watched him for a minute and\r\nthen said dryly, “How like you are now to your cousins of Falaise!” The\r\nimpudence of the remark appealed to Henry, who lay back and roared with\r\nlaughter, and then himself explained to such of his courtiers as had not\r\ngrasped the point that the allusion was to his descent, through William\r\nthe Conqueror, from the peasant girl of Falaise, a town famous for its\r\nskinners and leatherworkers. This incident occurred after Hugh had been\r\npromoted, in 1186, from the priory of Witham to the bishopric of\r\nLincoln, which had been held from 1173 to 1182 by the king’s\r\nacknowledged bastard, Geoffrey, who, however, preferring rather to\r\nfleece than to tend his sheep, had never been consecrated to the see.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that Henry, himself careless of religion and actively\r\nantagonistic to the Church, should have lavished his warmest affection\r\nupon two men destined after their death to rank in the calendar of\r\nsaints. The intimate friend of his early years became St. Thomas of\r\nCanterbury, and the chosen associate of the closing years of his reign\r\nwas destined to become St. Hugh of Lincoln. The claims to saintship of\r\nthe two men were singularly different; Thomas was one of those arrogant,\r\nfighting ecclesiastics who identify the cause of the Church with\r\nthemselves and “take the kingdom of heaven by violence,” while Hugh was\r\na man of peace, one of those who identify themselves with the cause of\r\nGod, to whom beatification comes as the natural reward for the blessings\r\nthey have themselves bestowed upon their flocks. Of the two St. Thomas\r\ninevitably made the greater impression upon the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEAL OF THOMAS BECKET ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY (1/1)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEAL OF HUGH BISHOP OF LINCOLN (1/1)]\r\n\r\npopular imagination, and his shrine was a centre of pilgrimage long\r\nbefore St. Hugh had even left his obscure priory for the great bishopric\r\nof Lincoln. A great impulse was no doubt given to the adoration of St.\r\nThomas by the events of 1174, when the capture of the King of Scotland\r\nfollowed so immediately upon Henry’s penance at Canterbury. In the\r\ntwelfth century people did not talk of coincidence or propound elaborate\r\ntheories that the concentration of Henry’s mind upon the desire for\r\nvictory had acted upon the brain centres of Ranulph de Glanville’s\r\nsubconsciousness and spurred him on to action. They simply accepted as a\r\nfact the personal intervention of St. Thomas, and Henry himself\r\ncountenanced that view by going with his royal son on a pilgrimage of\r\nthanksgiving to Canterbury on 28th May 1175. Later in that year the\r\nyoung Queen Margaret visited the shrine “for the sake of prayer,” and it\r\nis not improbable that we have the partial fulfilment of her petitions\r\nin the birth of a son at Paris in June 1177; but if so the answer to her\r\nprayers was only partial, for the child lived barely long enough to be\r\nchristened William, and died within three days of his birth. A still\r\nmore remarkable tribute to the fame of St. Thomas was paid in 1179. At\r\nthat time King Louis was arranging for the coronation of his son Philip,\r\nthen fourteen years old, but just before the date fixed for the ceremony\r\nthe boy fell ill as the result of a hunting misadventure. Casting about\r\nin his mind for a suitable spiritual advocate it was not unnatural that\r\nthe king’s choice should fall upon Thomas of Canterbury; if he had come\r\nso effectually to the help of his old adversary Henry he might surely be\r\nrelied upon to assist his old supporter Louis. King Henry readily\r\nacceded to the French king’s request for a safe conduct and met him in\r\nperson at Dover on 22nd August, whence the two kings went next day to\r\nCanterbury. Here King Louis offered his petition at the tomb of the\r\nsaint and enriched the convent with the grant of a yearly render of wine\r\nand exemption from customs for goods exported for their use from France.\r\n\r\nOn his return to France the king found his son convalescent, and in\r\nNovember the postponed coronation took place, the younger Henry being\r\namongst those present. But before this date King Louis himself had been\r\nstruck down with paralysis, and after nine months’ illness he died on\r\n18th September 1180. Death was busy about this time; Richard de Luci,\r\nthe great justiciar, had died in July 1179 at the priory of Lesnes,\r\nwhich he had founded; Pope Alexander III. died in August 1181, and\r\nRoger, Archbishop of York, in the following November. In Louis, Henry\r\nlost an old antagonist, but one whose weakness and incompetence had been\r\na source of strength to the English king. Henry had never pursued an\r\naggressive policy towards France and had never attempted to crush Louis\r\nor even to throw off his nominal suzerainty; when their claims clashed,\r\nas they frequently had done, he was content to defeat the attack or\r\noutwit the diplomacy of the French king, but in the young Philip there\r\nwas growing up a far more formidable adversary and one who could neither\r\nbe hoodwinked nor driven from the field without difficulty. For the\r\ntime, however, Henry’s relations with the young French king were almost\r\npaternal. In the spring of 1180 Henry intervened to reconcile Philip and\r\nhis uncles of the house of Blois, and in July of the following year he\r\npatched up a peace between Philip and his wife’s uncle, Count Philip of\r\nFlanders. This peace was broken before the end of the year, when Count\r\nPhilip formed a coalition against the King of France, and he might have\r\nfared badly if the younger Henry, who had remained in Normandy after his\r\nfather had gone back to England, had not come to the rescue. Peace was\r\nagain patched up between France and Flanders by Henry in March 1182, and\r\nthe two Philips united with Henry in intervening on behalf of the\r\nlatter’s son-in-law, Henry the Lion of Saxony, who had incurred the\r\nenmity of the Emperor Frederic and had been sentenced to seven years’\r\nbanishment. As a result of this intervention the duke’s sentence was\r\nsubstantially reduced, and when he came to Normandy with his wife and\r\nchildren he was warmly welcomed and liberally provided for by Henry.\r\n\r\nConspicuous as was Henry’s success in dealing with foreign princes, his\r\nfailure when dealing with his own sons was equally conspicuous. He\r\ncould act as peacemaker between France and Flanders, but from 1176\r\nonwards his sons were continually at war, sometimes assisting one\r\nanother to suppress rebellious vassals, at other times quarrelling among\r\nthemselves. Richard in particular was continually fighting in Poitou,\r\nwhere his arrogance and licentiousness had made him extremely unpopular\r\nwith his subjects. Matters came to a crisis early in 1183, when, upon\r\nRichard’s refusing to do homage for Poitou to the younger Henry, the\r\nlatter with his brother Geoffrey joined the discontented Poitevins and\r\nmade war upon Richard. King Henry came to the help of Richard and\r\nadvanced to Limoges, where he had a narrow escape from being shot by his\r\nsons’ soldiers. The rebellious princes, relying upon their father’s\r\naffection, obtained a succession of truces which they broke without\r\ncompunction whenever it suited their purpose, ill-treating his\r\nmessengers and plundering his supporters. Geoffrey stripped the shrine\r\nof St. Martial at Limoges in order to pay his mercenaries, and the young\r\nking, finding his plans going astray, took an oath at that same shrine\r\nto go on crusade. His father endeavoured to persuade him to renounce the\r\nrash vow, but when he found him apparently intent upon the project\r\ngenerously promised to equip him. He repaid the generous offer by\r\nabandoning the scheme and indulging in a plundering foray, stripping the\r\nmonastery of Grammont, the one religious house for which his father had\r\ndisplayed an affection. Towards the end of May 1183 the young king fell\r\nill, but this did not deter him from sacking the famous shrine of\r\nRoquemadour. On his way back from this sacrilegious exploit he was\r\nobliged to stop at Martel, as his fever had much increased and soon\r\ndeveloped into dysentery. Realising that it was likely to end in death\r\nhe sent for his father, but Henry, naturally suspecting a trap, would\r\nnot come, though he sent a sapphire ring to his son as a token of his\r\naffection, and possibly with the hope that the mystic curative qualities\r\nof that precious stone might prove beneficial. On 11th June the young\r\nman died, expressing a pious penitence which would have been more\r\nedifying had it been displayed earlier, and commissioning the faithful\r\nWilliam Marshal, who had just been recalled to his court after an\r\nundeserved period of exile, to perform for him the two years’ crusade\r\nwhich he had sworn to undertake.\r\n\r\nThe death of the unfilial and unprincipled Henry had followed so close\r\nupon his sacrilegious spoliation of St. Amadour that it might well have\r\nbeen considered a divine judgment, and it is almost incredible that even\r\nhis most devoted partisans could have proclaimed him a saint; yet such\r\nwas the case, and a few audacious and imaginative adherents even\r\nasserted that miracles had been wrought by him. His liberality, good\r\nfellowship, and manly courage, which showed itself in his addiction to\r\nthe tournament, a form of sport so far from saintly that it was under\r\nthe papal ban, had made him friends who mourned his loss; a still larger\r\nnumber regretted the removal of a tool so useful for undermining the\r\ninfluence of the hated King of England. The one man who sorrowed for him\r\nmost sincerely was the father against whom he had sinned so\r\npersistently.\r\n\r\nWithin a month of the young king’s death the rebellion which he had\r\nfomented was at an end. During the latter half of 1183 Henry appears to\r\nhave made an uneventful tour through his continental dominions, but in\r\nthe spring of 1184 we find him negotiating for the re-marriage of the\r\nCount of Flanders, sending his own royal yacht to fetch the bride, a\r\ndaughter of the King of Portugal, and conducting her from La Rochelle to\r\nthe Flemish border. And, more or less as the result of this marriage, we\r\nfind him called upon to interfere once more between the King of France\r\nand the Count of Flanders to procure peace. Immediately afterwards, on\r\n10th June 1184, Henry crossed once more to England, after an absence of\r\ntwo years. The next six months were largely taken up with the choice of\r\na successor to Archbishop Richard, who had died in the preceding\r\nFebruary. At last, after several names had been suggested by the\r\nCanterbury monks only to be rejected by the king, Bishop Baldwin of\r\nWorcester was elected on 16th December.\r\n\r\nThe year 1185 opened with the arrival at Canterbury of Heraclius,\r\nPatriarch of Jerusalem, charged by Baldwin, the head of the tottering\r\nkingdom of Jerusalem, with an appeal to Henry for help. On 18th March\r\nHenry gave formal audience to Heraclius, who offered him the keys of the\r\nHoly Sepulchre and the crown of Jerusalem, and produced a letter from\r\nthe pope urging a new crusade. By the advice of his council Henry\r\ndeclared his inability to go in person, and he also declined to accept\r\nthe crown for any of his sons, but he promised assistance in men and\r\nmoney, and large numbers of his nobles took the cross. A month later the\r\nking and the patriarch passed over together into Normandy, and on 1st\r\nMay they had an interview with King Philip of France, who took up the\r\nsame line as Henry had done, so that Heraclius had to return to his\r\nmaster with the promise indeed of assistance, but disappointed in his\r\nhopes of obtaining an influential leader. As soon as the interview was\r\nover Henry had to turn his attention to his quarrelsome son Richard.\r\nUntaught by experience, the king had continued to provoke his sons\r\nagainst one another and against himself, striving to wrest Aquitaine\r\nfrom Richard for the benefit of John and then setting John and Geoffrey\r\nto fight their elder brother; this quarrel had been composed for a time,\r\nbut Richard was now attacking the lands of his brother Geoffrey, and in\r\norder to quiet him Henry sent for Queen Eleanor, the rightful owner of\r\nPoitou, and forced Richard to surrender the province into his mother’s\r\nhands. This had the desired effect of restoring order, and in August\r\n1186 Geoffrey was killed in a tournament at Paris, regretted by none\r\nexcept his father and Philip of France.\r\n\r\nIn May 1186 Henry, who was an inveterate matchmaker, had arranged for\r\nthe marriage of King William of Scotland with his cousin Ermengarde,\r\ndaughter of Richard, Viscount of Beaumont. The marriage took place at\r\nWoodstock on 5th September, Henry’s wedding present taking the shape of\r\nthe Castle of Edinburgh; but before it was celebrated the two kings had\r\nmarched north together, in July, and compelled Ronald, son of Uctred,\r\nthe usurping Lord of Galloway, to submit to Henry’s judgment. But while\r\nHenry’s relations with his old adversary of Scotland were thus\r\nsatisfactory there was growing friction between him and Philip of\r\nFrance. The questions of the dower due to the young king’s widow,\r\nMargaret, and of the marriage of Philip’s other sister Alais to Richard,\r\nhad been debated with acrimony on several occasions, and the action of\r\nthe English Constable of Gisors in destroying a fortress in process of\r\nerection on the French border and killing the son of the French knight\r\nin charge of the work, in October 1186, had further exasperated Philip.\r\nFor the time the storm blew over, but in May 1187, after an ineffective\r\nendeavour to come to terms with Philip, Henry prepared for war. The\r\nFrench king besieged Richard and John at Châteauroux and Henry had to\r\ncome to their rescue, but a pitched battle was avoided by the\r\ninterposition of Pope Urban III., whose anxiety for the fate of\r\nPalestine made him particularly desirous of peace in Europe, and a truce\r\nfor two years was agreed upon on 23rd June. Immediately afterwards\r\nPhilip began to cultivate Richard’s friendship, hoping to use him\r\nagainst his father, as he had done young Henry and Geoffrey. Richard\r\nswallowed the bait and went off with Philip, living for some time in the\r\nclosest intimacy with him, ignoring his father’s remonstrances, and even\r\nplundering his treasury at Chinon; but after a while he came to a better\r\nmind and returned to his allegiance.\r\n\r\nIn January 1188 Henry was preparing to return to England, when Philip\r\nthreatened to invade Normandy unless the marriage of his sister Alais\r\nand Richard were celebrated at once and the fortress of Gisors\r\nsurrendered to France. Henry at once proceeded to meet him at the usual\r\nplace, a great elm standing on the borders of France and Normandy near\r\nGisors. Little progress was made in the negotiations until the arrival\r\nof the Archbishop of Tyre, who preached a stirring sermon on the\r\nmisfortunes of Palestine, recounting the capture of King Guy and the\r\nTrue Cross by Saladin in July 1187--a disaster which caused the death of\r\nPope Urban III.--and the fall of Jerusalem in the following October. His\r\nhearers were so moved that almost with one accord they vowed to go upon\r\ncrusade, Henry and Philip setting the example and putting aside all\r\ntheir differences. So great were the numbers of those that took the\r\ncross that it was needful to adopt badges to distinguish the different\r\nnationalities, the French wearing red crosses, the followers of the\r\nEnglish king white crosses, and the Flemings green. Henry at once issued\r\norders at Le Mans for the collection of a tithe to be levied throughout\r\nall his continental dominions. All persons who did not go to the crusade\r\nthemselves were to give a tenth of their goods, and arrangements were\r\nmade for ensuring that none should evade his duty. Those who were\r\nwilling to serve in person might take the tithes of their men and lands\r\nfor their own equipment. As soon as this ordinance had been published\r\nHenry hastened to England, landing at Winchester on 30th January. A\r\nfortnight later a council was held at Geddington, when the ordinance for\r\nthe collection of the crusading tithe, usually known as the Saladin\r\ntithe, was made applicable to England. The King of Scotland was urged to\r\nfollow his suzerain’s lead, and Archbishop Baldwin was sent to preach\r\nthe crusade in Wales, accompanied by Gerald de Barri, who has left an\r\naccount of the mission containing many interesting details of Welsh\r\ntopography and history and a very full appreciation of the services\r\nrendered by Gerald himself.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Richard, who had taken the cross the previous year in\r\nBrittany, was indulging in a little war with the Count of Toulouse with\r\nconsiderable success. Philip, who appears to have incited Richard to\r\naction in order to pick a further quarrel with Henry, now complained to\r\nthe latter of his son’s conduct, and in June invaded Berry, capturing\r\nChâteauroux and other places. Henry crossed once more, for the last\r\ntime, to Normandy, to find that Richard had driven Philip out of Berry.\r\nAfter some desultory border raiding a conference was arranged between\r\nthe two kings at the historic elm by Gisors. Neither side would accede\r\nto the demands of the other, and after a proposal to settle the dispute\r\nby battle between four picked champions from either side had been\r\nrejected, preparations were made to resume the campaign. Some of the\r\nFrench troops, irritated at the sight of the English resting in comfort\r\nin the shade of the elm while they themselves were out in the heat, cut\r\ndown the famous tree. Philip was annoyed at the spiteful vandalism, and\r\nHenry vowed to revenge the elm.\r\n\r\nFor the moment no fighting took place; the Counts of Flanders and of\r\nBlois and other French nobles declining to serve any longer against\r\nChristians when their arms were so badly needed in Palestine, Philip was\r\nobliged to disband his forces, and Henry did likewise, giving, however,\r\nsecret orders for their reassembly at Pacey. Thence he sent them across\r\nthe French border to ravage the district round Mantes, while Richard\r\noperated further south from Châteauroux. King Henry took little active\r\npart in this campaign, as he had been taken ill at Chinon early in the\r\nautumn. A meeting of the kings at Châtillon in October came to nothing,\r\nand Philip began to tamper with Richard’s unstable fidelity. A promise\r\nthat he should have Anjou, Touraine and Maine in reward for deserting\r\nhis father speedily brought Richard over to Philip’s side, and the\r\nlatter then arranged for a fresh conference with Henry at Bonmoulins on\r\n18th November. Richard and Philip arrived together, and though the\r\nformer explained to his father that his meeting with the French king on\r\nthe way was quite accidental, Henry’s incredulity and alarm were soon\r\njustified. Philip, after proposing a mutual retrocession of all\r\nterritories taken during the recent campaign, again demanded the\r\nmarriage of Richard and Alais, the cession to Richard of Anjou, Touraine\r\nand Maine, and his acknowledgment as Henry’s heir. King Henry refused\r\nthese last demands, and Richard angrily flung down his sword and did\r\nhomage to Philip for the three provinces which his father had refused\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nA truce had been agreed upon to last until 13th January 1189, but with\r\nits expiration Philip and Richard renewed the attack. Henry, whose\r\nhealth had completely broken down, was laid up at Le Mans during the\r\nspring, and from there he sent William Marshal and the Archdeacon of\r\nHereford to Paris to negotiate with King Philip; but by the efforts of\r\nRichard and his wily minister, William Longchamp, their endeavours were\r\nbrought to nought. A slight improvement in his health enabled Henry to\r\nmeet his opponents in person on 28th May at La Ferté Bernard, where\r\nRichard’s demand that his brother John should go on crusade was met by\r\nHenry not merely with a direct negative but with the suggestion that\r\nJohn should marry Alais and have the provinces which Richard claimed.\r\nThis, while exasperating Richard still more completely, did not appeal\r\nto Philip, and, in spite of the efforts of the legate, Cardinal John of\r\nAnagni, who threatened to lay his dominions under an interdict if he did\r\nnot make peace, the French king resumed the campaign with vigour, and\r\nafter several smaller successes appeared before Le Mans on 12th June.\r\nThe bridges across the Sarthe had been broken down and the known fords\r\nblocked with sharp stakes, but the French cavalry, sounding the river\r\nwith their spears, found a place where they could cross and caught the\r\nEnglish by surprise. During the sharp fighting that ensued outside the\r\ntown Stephen of Tours, the governor of the town, set fire to a suburb\r\nwhose buildings would have afforded dangerous cover for the assailants.\r\nUnfortunately the wind suddenly shifted and, blowing strongly, drove the\r\nflames into the city, which itself caught fire in several places.\r\nRealising the desperate nature of their position King Henry and his\r\nknights sought safety in flight. They were pursued by a force of cavalry\r\nunder the leadership of Richard, who was some way in advance of his\r\nfollowers and rapidly overtaking the king when William Marshal turned\r\nupon him. Count Richard had for some reason thrown aside his defensive\r\narmour, and, seeing himself at the Marshal’s mercy, called to him not\r\nto kill him. “Not I! the devil may kill you!” retorted the knight, and,\r\nlowering his lance, he struck the count’s horse dead, bringing its rider\r\nto the ground. Richard at once called off his men and abandoned the\r\npursuit, and Henry, pausing for a while on a little hill and looking\r\nback upon his beloved native town in flames, burst into a flood of\r\nfurious blasphemy, vowing that as God had cheated him of the place which\r\nhe loved better than all others so he would cheat God of his soul.\r\n\r\nWith Henry were his son John and his illegitimate son Geoffrey. This\r\nGeoffrey, the only one of Henry’s sons worthy of the name, was born\r\nabout 1153, his mother being a woman of humble position;[36] he was\r\ndevoted to his father and, as bishop-elect of Lincoln, had taken a\r\nvigorous part in the suppression of the rebellion of 1173-4. Resigning\r\nthe see of Lincoln in 1181 he became chancellor, in which office he was\r\nin constant attendance upon the king. At Le Mans he fought valiantly\r\nwith fire and foe, and now that the fugitives had reached Fresnai he\r\nproposed to spend the night outside the castle so as to bear the brunt\r\nof any attack that might be made. To this Henry would not assent, and it\r\nwas Geoffrey’s cloak that covered the weary king when he flung himself\r\ndown, clothed as he was, for the night. Next day, refusing the advice of\r\nhis barons to fall back on\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEAL OF GEOFFREY THE BASTARD AS BISHOP ELECT OF LINCOLN\r\n(1/1)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEAL OF JOHN AS COUNT OF MORTAIN (1/1)]\r\n\r\nNormandy, Henry sent Geoffrey with almost all his forces to Alençon,\r\nhimself making his way towards Chinon. John now took the opportunity of\r\ndeserting his father, although Henry had just shown his partiality for\r\nhim by making the seneschal of Normandy and Earl William de Mandeville\r\nswear that in the event of his death they would only give up the castles\r\nof Normandy to John and to none other. Geoffrey, his brother, base in\r\nbirth but not in nature, as soon as he had discharged his commission\r\nspurred back to join his royal father, whose illness, aggravated by the\r\nstrain and grief of the last few days, had entered upon its final stage.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Philip, carrying everything before him, had reached Tours on\r\n30th June. There he received a mission from the Count of Flanders, the\r\nArchbishop of Rheims, and the Duke of Burgundy, urging him to come to\r\nterms with Henry. Tours was captured on 3rd July, and next day King\r\nHenry agreed to a meeting at a house of Templars not far from Colombier,\r\nnear Azai, but when Henry reached the spot and dismounted he found that\r\nhis legs would not support him, and his agony was such that he was\r\nobliged to lie down. King Philip and Richard on their arrival, not\r\nfinding Henry, denounced his illness as a feint, and it was not until\r\nthe king rode up, supported on his horse by his attendants, that they\r\nrealised that he was dying. Philip courteously spread a cloak upon the\r\nground and bade him be seated, but his indomitable spirit would not\r\nallow him to display so much weakness. He had come prepared to accept\r\nany terms, to make any concessions, but with the full intention, if he\r\nlived, of winning all back by the power of the sword. Philip’s terms,\r\nconsidering the hopeless position of his adversary, were not ungenerous.\r\nHenry had to surrender all claims to Auvergne and to do homage to Philip\r\nfor his continental dominions; Alais was to be taken from his custody\r\nand married to Richard, who was to be recognised as his father’s heir\r\nand to receive the fealty of his barons. Moreover, all those who had\r\njoined Richard during the war were to remain his men and not to return\r\nto their allegiance to Henry. Finally, Henry was to pay 20,000 marks to\r\nthe French king, and the agreement for a common crusade was renewed,\r\nLent 1190 being named as the date and Vézelay as the rendezvous. At the\r\nend of the interview Henry had to give his son the formal kiss of peace,\r\nbut as he did so he muttered, “May God grant that I live long enough to\r\ntake my revenge upon you,” a threat at which Richard openly jested to\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\nHenry returned from Colombier to Chinon, and as he lay upon his deathbed\r\nthe list of those who had deserted him and sworn allegiance to Richard\r\nwas brought in. He bade the bearer read out the names, but when the\r\nfirst name of all proved to be his best-loved son, John, for whom he had\r\ndone so much, he stopped the reader, saying, “It is enough! Now let come\r\nwhat may!” Broken-hearted and racked with pain the great king lingered\r\non for two days, muttering in his delirium “Shame on a conquered king!”\r\nand cursing his sons. The sole redeeming feature of these last days was\r\nthe unremitting tenderness with which Geoffrey nursed his father, who\r\nrepaid his affectionate care with words of loving praise, giving him at\r\nthe last his royal signet ring engraved with his symbol, a leopard.[37]\r\nYet even Geoffrey seems to have been absent at the moment that his\r\nfather passed away, and the few servants who were there, seizing the\r\nopportunity to lay hands on everything portable that was worth taking,\r\nleft the king’s body lying half naked and uncared for, till one William\r\nTrihan, known only to history for this good act, placed over his royal\r\nmaster his cloak, appropriately one of the short Angevin cloaks, the\r\nintroduction of which into England had earned Henry the nickname of\r\n“Courtmantel.”\r\n\r\nThus, on 6th July 1189, died Henry II.\r\n\r\nNext day the dead king was carried to Fontevrault, where, in the church\r\nof the great nunnery, his body lay for a time in state. Hither came\r\nRichard, now in his turn king; for a while he stood and gazed at the\r\nstern uncovered face of his father, then, kneeling for a brief moment in\r\nprayer, rose, and calling William Marshal and Maurice de Craon to him,\r\nstrode out of the church. In a few words he showed that he bore no\r\nill-will towards his father’s loyal adherents and then departed, to\r\nreturn next day for the funeral. Henry had never cared much for the\r\noutward pomp and circumstance of kings, and such emblems of royalty as\r\nhe may have had with him in his last days seem to have been either lost\r\nat Le Mans or stolen at the time of his death. And so when he was being\r\nrobed for burial it was with difficulty that the royal insignia of\r\ncrown, ring and sceptre could be improvised, and he who had been the\r\ngreatest of the princes of Europe was laid to rest with less ceremonial\r\nsplendour than many an obscure vassal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n_Neur dein, Photo._\r\n\r\nTOMB OF HENRY II AT FONTEVRAULT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nLEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY OF THE REIGN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reign of Henry II. is of particular importance in English\r\nconstitutional and legal history. It was a period of evolution, of\r\ncrystallisation, a period of transition. As in architecture we have at\r\nthis time the transition from Norman, or Romanesque, to Gothic, so we\r\nhave the transition from oral tradition and custom to written law and\r\nformula. As the Saxon blood was blending with the Norman to form the\r\nEnglish people, so Saxon law was assimilating Roman law and the theories\r\nof the Canonists to form English law. The genius of Henry lay rather in\r\norganisation than in initiative. Possessing an innate love of justice\r\nand an instructed appreciation of legal forms, he set himself to evolve\r\nmethod and order from the somewhat chaotic confusion of conflicting\r\ncustoms. Under his hand the young plant of English law was pruned,\r\ntrained, and bent in the direction in which it was to grow during the\r\nsucceeding centuries. His natural inclination for the work was doubtless\r\nwhetted by the twofold consideration that every extension of the central\r\nroyal jurisdiction involved a diminution of local feudal jurisdiction\r\nand that increase of legal control implied increase of revenue. The\r\npersonal part played by the king in the administration of the law was\r\nstriking. Constantly we find him sitting in a judicial capacity,\r\nfollowing with more or less patience the involved arguments of the\r\nadvocates, inspecting charters in dispute, criticising them shrewdly and\r\nimpartially, and exhibiting a legal acumen which proved that he was\r\nworthy, apart from his rank, to preside over the ultimate court of\r\nappeal.[38] The strong arm of the law could hardly be invoked without\r\nhis aid, and the slow foot of justice could only be hastened with his\r\nassistance. And for such assistance payment must be made. Henry was,\r\nindeed, notorious as a “seller of justice”; but if the commodity was\r\nexpensive it was at least the best of its kind, and there is a profound\r\ngulf between the selling of justice and of injustice. A bribe might be\r\nrequired to set the machine of the law in motion, but it would be\r\nunavailing to divert its course when once started. When John le Viel, a\r\nwealthy citizen of London, was convicted of taking part in a series of\r\noutrages which culminated in the murder of Earl Ferrers’ brother in\r\n1177, his offer of 500 marks to the king gained him no reprieve and he\r\nsuffered the death penalty with his humbler and poorer accomplices.\r\n\r\nIt is partly owing to the personal predominance of the king as law-giver\r\nthat exact dates and details of the institution or formal adoption of\r\ncertain methods of legal procedure are hard to ascertain. A verbal\r\ninstruction or a few written lines to the justiciar would be enough to\r\nestablish a formula which would rapidly become a commonplace of law\r\nwithout exciting comment from any chronicler. There are, however, some\r\nfour or five occasions on which a definite code of laws or regulations\r\nwas published and duly recorded. The first of these was the code drawn\r\nup in 1164 to define the relations of Church and State. The\r\ncircumstances in which these “Constitutions of Clarendon” were drawn up\r\nhave already been considered. They were drawn up definitely as\r\nrepresenting the rules in force in the time of Henry I., and it would\r\nseem that for the most part they could fairly claim this antiquity,\r\nthough their continuity had been broken by the disorder of Stephen’s\r\nreign. That they lost something of their elasticity and became more\r\npronouncedly favourable to the secular courts when they were reduced to\r\nwriting can hardly be doubted, and that there was some small amount of\r\nactual innovation is highly probable, but it is as compiler rather than\r\nauthor that the name of Henry II. should be associated with the\r\nConstitutions of Clarendon.\r\n\r\nBy these Constitutions it was asserted (cap. 1) that all actions\r\nconcerning the advowsons of churches should be heard in the king’s\r\ncourt,[39] even if both parties were clerks, and that (cap. 2) the\r\nking’s consent must be obtained before any church held in fee of the\r\ncrown could be granted in perpetuity. By a further assertion of the\r\nroyal proprietary rights (cap. 12) the king claimed to have the custody\r\nand control of all sees, and of such monasteries as were in the\r\npatronage of the crown, during their vacancies, and to determine when\r\ntheir new heads should be elected. Whatever may be said against this\r\nclaim morally--and it certainly gave the king every inducement to\r\nprolong such vacancies and leave a wealthy see or abbey headless--it was\r\nundoubtedly a custom of respectable antiquity, based presumably on\r\nanalogy with the king’s feudal right to the custody of the lands of his\r\nlay tenants-in-chief during the minority of their heirs. The identity of\r\nstatus of lay and ecclesiastical tenants was insisted upon in the order\r\n(cap. 11) that prelates and beneficed clergy who held of the king in\r\nchief should hold their lands as baronies and perform the services due\r\ntherefrom, including the duty of sitting as judges on the Bench with the\r\nlay barons, save that they should not take part in pronouncing sentence\r\nof death or mutilation.\r\n\r\nBesides pleas of advowsons all pleas of debt were now removed from the\r\necclesiastical courts (cap. 15), even when involving breach of oath. A\r\nthird class of actions, those concerned with lands said to be granted in\r\nalms to churches, involved a more elaborate procedure (cap. 9). If a\r\npiece of land were claimed by a clerk as belonging to his church and by\r\na layman as belonging to his lay fee the question was first to be\r\nreferred to a jury of twelve men of good standing; if they decided that\r\nthe land was held in alms the case should be tried in the ecclesiastical\r\ncourt, but if the contrary, then in the king’s court. The appearance of\r\nthis jury of twelve is very important, and it occurs again in the\r\nConstitutions. Certain moral offences were admittedly the province of\r\nthe Court Christian, but it was common knowledge that the archdeacons\r\nand their officials, whether from lack of legal training or of charity,\r\naccepted accusations on very insufficient evidence; it was therefore\r\nlaid down (cap. 6) that such accusations ought not to be made against\r\nlaymen unless supported by responsible witnesses; but in cases where\r\nwitnesses dare not come forward, owing to the rank or power of the\r\naccused, a jury of twelve men of good standing might be summoned to\r\ninquire into the truth of the accusations.\r\n\r\nIn these two instances of the appointment of juries we have almost\r\ncertainly innovations, and it is to Henry II. that we must attribute the\r\ninstitution of the trial by jury. It must be borne in mind that just as\r\nthese twelve jurors differed in everything but number from the\r\nAnglo-Saxon “doomsmen,” whose office was to give sentence, so they also\r\ndiffered from the modern jury. The modern juryman is supposed to start\r\nwith a completely open mind, and indeed in America even a remote and\r\nsuperficial knowledge of the nature of the case to be tried has been\r\nconsidered a disqualification; but the medieval jurors were men chosen\r\nfor their knowledge of the matter in dispute; they were witnesses--not\r\nwitnesses for the prosecution or for the defence, but, being summoned by\r\nan impartial authority, witnesses for the truth; they answered the\r\nquestions put to them in the light of their personal knowledge and not\r\nas a result of deductions from the deliberately misleading arguments of\r\nrival advocates. The evolution and progress of legal procedure is always\r\ninteresting, and particularly so in the case of the peculiarly English\r\ninstitution of the jury. The occasional appointment of juries of inquest\r\nto settle special points may, of course, be traced back for generations,\r\nbut the definite establishment of the jury as a legal instrument dates\r\nfrom the reign of Henry II.\r\n\r\nThe claims of the spiritual courts were complicated by possessing a\r\ndouble basis; on the one hand they claimed all actions which could in\r\nany way be held to be concerned with morals or with the property of the\r\nChurch, and on the other they claimed jurisdiction over all persons who\r\nhad been admitted to the ranks of the clergy. While admitting the theory\r\nof clerical exemption in criminal cases Henry endeavoured to neutralise\r\nit in practice. The suggested compromise, which was the chief bone of\r\ncontention between him and the Church party, was (cap. 3) that an\r\naccused clerk should be summoned before the king’s court, and if a\r\n_primâ facie_ case were made out against him he should be remitted to\r\nthe bishop’s court for fuller trial and sentence, the proceedings being\r\nwatched by one of the royal officials. If convicted he should _ipso\r\nfacto_ forfeit the Church’s protection and become amenable to the common\r\nlaw. This latter proviso had to be abandoned, but within about a century\r\nof the birth of the Constitutions the royal courts had established their\r\nright to pronounce upon the guilt of an accused clerk before handing him\r\nover to the ecclesiastical court. While the Church was claiming\r\nexemption from lay justice it was natural that an endeavour should be\r\nmade in retaliation to limit the scope of the Church’s sentence, and\r\naccordingly it was ordered (cap. 7) that no tenant-in-chief or royal\r\nofficer should be excommunicated without the king’s permission, and a\r\nsimilar protection was extended (cap. 10) to all persons dwelling in a\r\nroyal borough, castle, or manor. In both cases it was expressly stated\r\nthat the king or his officials would endeavour to compel the offender to\r\nmake satisfaction, so obviating the necessity for excommunication, and\r\nindeed it was laid down (cap. 13) that the royal and ecclesiastical\r\ncourts should give one another mutual assistance in bringing offenders\r\nto book.\r\n\r\nA further blow was aimed at clerical independence by the regulation\r\n(cap. 8) that there should be appeals from the archdeacon’s court to\r\nthat of the bishop and thence to that of the archbishop, but that appeal\r\nfrom the archbishop’s court should be to the king’s court and not to\r\nRome without royal consent. To prevent this rule being broken Henry\r\nmaintained (cap. 4) that prelates and beneficed clergy had no right to\r\nleave the country without royal licence, and that in any case they must\r\nswear to do nothing to the prejudice of king or realm during their\r\nabsence. The supremacy of the pope, however, proved to be too firmly\r\nrooted in the minds of the clergy, and these articles had to be dropped,\r\nHenry himself during the Becket controversy being obliged to resort to\r\nconstant appeals and counter-appeals to the papal court.\r\n\r\nDuring the seven years’ struggle with Becket which followed the\r\npromulgation of the Constitutions of Clarendon, Henry did not neglect\r\nthe cause of legal reform, and early in 1166 he issued an important\r\nseries of injunctions known as the Assize of Clarendon. These\r\ninjunctions, turning upon the existence of a system of itinerant\r\njustices, whose presence in all parts of the country at frequent\r\nintervals they take for granted, prove that the custom of sending\r\ncommissions of judges on circuit, which had been inaugurated by Henry\r\nI., but had fallen almost out of use, and certainly out of all\r\nregularity, under Stephen, had been restored by Henry II. The evidence\r\nof the Pipe Rolls shows that during the early years of the reign most\r\nof these “eyres,” or itinerant courts, were held by the leading royal\r\nofficers, such as the chancellor, the justiciar, or the Earl of Essex,\r\nacting singly or together, but in 1176 the king divided the whole\r\ncountry into six circuits and appointed three justices to each circuit.\r\nFor some reason this scheme did not work well, possibly from an excess\r\nof zeal and self-importance on the part of the justices, and in 1179\r\nHenry revoked these appointments and constituted a central royal court\r\nof five justices; subsidiary to this permanent court he established four\r\ncircuits, the commission for each circuit being five judges, though, by\r\nan apparent contradiction, the commissioners for the northern circuit\r\nwere the officers of the permanent central court. The arrangement of the\r\ncircuits varied from time to time and constant changes were made in the\r\npersonnel of the judges, but the main features of itinerant courts with\r\na permanent central court above them became fixed. From the central\r\ncourt there was appeal in cases of difficulty to the king and\r\ncouncil.[40] As we have already said, Henry took a large personal share\r\nin the administration of justice, but he acted strictly within\r\nconstitutional limits, and it was always the council that pronounced the\r\nsentence, though the influence of the king’s expressed opinion would\r\nnaturally be paramount.\r\n\r\nBy the Assize of Clarendon it was ordered that the sheriffs and\r\nitinerant justices should make careful search for evil-doers throughout\r\nthe country. Twelve men of good standing from each hundred and four from\r\neach township were to declare on oath what men in their district were\r\nknown or suspected to be robbers, murderers, thieves, or harbourers of\r\nbad characters. All such were at once to be arrested and brought before\r\nthe nearest justice and compelled to purge themselves by the ordeal of\r\nwater. In this ordeal the accused was bound hand and foot and thrown\r\ninto a pond or pit, of which the water had previously been consecrated\r\nby a priest.[41] If the water rejected him, so that he floated, he was\r\nconsidered guilty, his foot was struck off and his goods were forfeited\r\nto the king; but if the water received him and he sank he was dragged to\r\nland and his innocence was held to have been proved. But a sceptical\r\nfeeling towards the ordeal was growing up, and the Assize ordered that\r\nif the repute of the accused were notoriously bad and the accusations\r\nagainst him well sustained, then, even if he acquitted himself by the\r\nordeal, he should be banished from the country, being bound to leave\r\nEngland within a week, or as soon after as the wind would serve.\r\n\r\nBy reserving all cases of this type to the jurisdiction of the king’s\r\ncourts and by authorising the sheriffs to enter any “liberty” or honour\r\nfor the purposes of arresting criminals or of supervising the police\r\norganisation of frank pledges a severe blow was struck at the private\r\nfeudal courts, and, incidentally, the security of the law-abiding\r\npopulace was much increased. To strengthen this security yet more the\r\nking gave orders for the erection of gaols in every county and for the\r\ncompilation of lists of fugitive criminals. No unknown wayfarer or\r\nvagabond might stay for more than one night in any borough unless he or\r\nhis horse fell ill, and all newcomers settling in any county had to find\r\nsureties for their appearance before the justices, while a final haven\r\nof refuge was closed to the fugitive by the rule that no religious house\r\nshould receive into its fellowship any man of the lower class (_de\r\nminuto populo_) without inquiry into his antecedents.\r\n\r\nIt is probably to this same year, 1166, that we may assign the Assize of\r\nNovel Disseisin, by which possession became not merely nine-tenths of\r\nthe law but the law itself. Under this assize any person who was seised,\r\nor possessed, of a freehold and was ejected therefrom, or disseised,\r\nwithout a previous decision of the court, might recover his seisin by an\r\naction before the king’s court, without regard to the goodness of his\r\noriginal title. There is some reason to believe that this theory of the\r\nright of the actual possessor to remain in possession until the claimant\r\nhad proved his better right to the property was recognised in the\r\nprevious reign, but it was under Henry II. that it took definite form as\r\na fixed method of legal procedure which formed the basis of innumerable\r\nactions in later times. About this same date, too, we find evolving\r\nanother legal form which was to play a very important part in the\r\nhistory of the conveyance of land. It is self-evident that from time to\r\ntime the parties concerned in a suit before the king’s court might find\r\nit to their mutual advantage to come to a compromise. As this would\r\ninvolve the abandoning of the suit, probably depriving the king of\r\ncertain perquisites of justice and certainly rendering nugatory the\r\ntrouble taken by the justices over the preliminaries of the trial, the\r\nking’s leave to compromise had to be purchased, and frequently the terms\r\nof the agreement were submitted to him for confirmation. To begin with,\r\nthese agreements, which from their putting an end to the suit were\r\ncalled “final concords” or “fines,” would be drawn up casually,\r\nexpressing each particular composition in such phrases as seemed most\r\nconvenient, but the Justiciar Glanville, writing at the end of Henry’s\r\nreign, lays down a definite formula to be used in drawing up a Fine, and\r\nthis formula can be traced back to 1172 and occurs, with slight\r\nvariations, as early as 1163,[42] though instances before 1180 are\r\nrare. When these Fines acquired the recognised status of legal formulæ\r\nsteps were taken to preserve official copies of them, and as soon as it\r\nwas realised that the execution of a Fine was the surest way of securing\r\na permanent record of a conveyance of land, or similar deed, it became\r\nthe practice to bring fictitious actions with the express intention of\r\ncompromising them and executing Fines. The Fine was, therefore, at a\r\nlater date almost invariably the termination of a fictitious suit, but\r\nthere is no reason to believe that this was so in the time of Henry II.\r\nto any great extent, and though we owe to him the formula of the Fine it\r\nremained in his time a genuine act of compromise, and incidentally a\r\nconsiderable source of revenue.\r\n\r\nThe administration of the Assize of Clarendon, especially of those\r\nportions concerned with forfeitures and pecuniary penalties, seems to\r\nhave given rise to much complaint. The sheriffs were said on the one\r\nhand to have used their power to extort more than was due and on the\r\nother hand to have paid into the exchequer less than was due. Further\r\nrumours of peculation in connection with the aid for the marriage of the\r\nking’s daughter in 1168 having reached Henry’s ears, he suspended all\r\nthe sheriffs in 1170, and ordered a careful and minute inquiry into the\r\nwhole question. All moneys paid to sheriffs and other officials, or to\r\nmagnates and their stewards, during the past four years, were to be set\r\ndown, with a notice whether they were demanded with lawful warrant or\r\nwithout. The value of the goods of convicted or fugitive felons and the\r\namounts paid towards the marriage aid were also to be returned, and note\r\nwas to be made of any bribes accepted by the sheriffs or hush-money\r\ngiven by them. The inquiry was also to extend to breaches of the Forest\r\nLaw and the conduct of the officials administering it. The only\r\nfragments of the returns[43] to this inquiry that are known to have\r\nsurvived throw little light on the general conduct of the sheriffs and\r\ntheir subordinates, though they illustrate the truth that taxation\r\nalways soaks through to the lowest stratum of society. Although taxation\r\nunder Henry did not fall with nearly so direct and crushing a force upon\r\nthe poor as under King Louis in France, the large sums extorted from the\r\nEnglish magnates had naturally to be raised by them in part from their\r\npoorer tenants, and if the king expected his lords to make large “gifts”\r\nof money to him it was natural that they should in turn impress upon\r\ntheir subjects the duty of giving “willingly” to them.\r\n\r\nOne immediate result of this inquiry of 1170 was the substitution of men\r\nfrom the ranks of the exchequer and court officials in place of local\r\nmagnates as sheriffs. The change was a wise one, increasing the skill\r\nof administration and reducing the risk of extortion and undue use of\r\ninfluence. The continuous undermining of the baronial authority, of\r\nwhich this was but one more instance, had a double effect at the time of\r\nthe young king’s rebellion in 1173; on the one hand it drove the more\r\nintolerant nobles to take up arms against King Henry, but on the other\r\nit put in the king’s hand a powerful organisation controlled by loyal\r\nofficials, whose prospects were bound up with his own and supported by\r\nthe mass of the people, who had every reason to appreciate his rule and\r\nto fear the victory of the feudal reactionaries. After the rebellion had\r\nquieted down Henry issued, at Northampton in 1176, an assize of wider\r\nscope than any other of his reign. The decrees of the Assize of\r\nClarendon were repeated but re-enforced; forgery and arson were added to\r\nthe Pleas of the Crown about which inquiry was to be made, and the\r\nconvicted felon was to lose a hand as well as a foot. Returns were to be\r\nmade of the escheats, churches, and heiresses who were in the king’s\r\ngift, and the justices were to try actions brought under the Assize of\r\nNovel Disseisin and were also given control of cases concerned with as\r\nlittle as half a knight’s fee. Finally, an important regulation was laid\r\ndown that if a free tenant died his son and heir should at once have\r\nsuch seisin of the freehold as his father had at the time of his death,\r\nand the widow should have her dower. If the lord of the fee did not\r\nadmit the heir of the freehold the justices should cause an inquest to\r\nbe made by the jury of twelve men which had now become so integral a\r\npart of legal procedure, and if they found that the father had died\r\nseised the heir should recover possession. In this we have clearly the\r\nfirst enunciation of the Assize of Mort d’Ancestor, which in course of\r\ntime was extended from the direct to the more remote degrees of kindred.\r\n\r\nThe work begun by the Assizes of Novel Disseisin and Mort d’Ancestor was\r\nbrought to a logical completion in 1179 by the institution of the Grand\r\nAssize. By this assize any action concerning a freehold could be\r\ntransferred from the manorial to the royal court. The demandant in the\r\nlower court was bound, as of old, to offer to prove his claim by the\r\njudicial duel, a clumsy process entailing endless delays and expense and\r\nthe humiliation, if not death, of the defeated party, and often ending\r\nin a way clearly contrary to justice. Now, by this new regulation, the\r\ntenant when challenged might “put himself upon the assize”; the\r\ndemandant would then sue a writ in the king’s court, four knights would\r\nbe appointed to elect a jury of twelve knights, or country gentlemen as\r\nwe should call them, associated with the district in which the disputed\r\nland lay. The jury had then to state from their own knowledge, or from\r\nwhat their fathers had told them, which of the two parties had the\r\nbetter claim to the land. If any of the jury did not know anything of\r\nthe matter they were discharged and others put in their place, and if\r\nthe knights were divided in opinion their numbers were increased until\r\ntwelve decided in favour of one party. Knowing, as we do from the Plea\r\nRolls of the next reign, how protracted a suit might be under this\r\nassize, we can appreciate from Glanville’s encomium on the comparative\r\nrapidity of the process how interminable must have been the proceedings\r\nunder the old methods. It was not only a great extension of the\r\ninfluence of the king’s court, but was also a victory for common sense\r\nand sound law, and the absurd and illogical ordeal by battle rapidly\r\nfell into disuse, though it was not actually repealed in English law\r\nuntil 1819 and is still retained for the settlement of international\r\nquarrels.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Assize of 1179 is the last definite reform of Common Law\r\nprocedure that we can connect with Henry’s name, but in 1184 he issued\r\nan Assize of the Forest. Under the Norman kings the doctrine of royal\r\nrights over those unreclaimed woodlands, moors, and heaths which were\r\nknown as forests was rigorously asserted. Henry I., in particular, had\r\nso stretched his claims as to exercise jurisdiction over the sporting\r\npreserves of his barons, ignoring their rights and oppressing their\r\ntenants by the application of the arbitrary regulations of the Forest\r\nLaw. Stephen had been compelled to relinquish all those forests which\r\nhad been created by Henry I., and to confine the claims of the crown to\r\nthose that were in existence at the time of the death of William Rufus,\r\nbut Henry II. had gradually reasserted his grandfather’s claims, though\r\nnot in their entirety. Henry himself was an ardent sportsman, finding in\r\nhunting and hawking an outlet for his ceaseless activity of spirit, and\r\nappears to have regarded poaching on the royal preserves as the most\r\nheinous of all offences. From the beginning of his reign justices from\r\ntime to time toured the country inquiring into breaches of the Forest\r\nLaw and mulcting the offenders, and we have seen how in 1176 he bled the\r\nwhole country by a deliberate abuse of that same law, but it does not\r\nseem that any definite code was drawn up until the assize was published\r\nat Woodstock in 1184. Whether this was a stiffening of the laws in use,\r\nas is generally assumed, or a relaxation, or merely a codification,\r\ncannot be decided. In any case the laws, though severe, were less savage\r\nthan those of Henry I. The technical details of the regulations touching\r\nthe king’s forests and his subjects’ woods and coverts cannot here be\r\ndealt with, but some of the devices to stop poaching may be noticed. No\r\none within the forest bounds might keep bows and arrows, dogs or hounds\r\nwithout licence; hunting at night involved a year’s imprisonment and a\r\nfine; all large dogs (_mastivi_) within the forest districts were to be\r\nhambled, that is to say, lamed by cutting out the ball of the foot, to\r\nprevent their chasing the deer, and no tanner or white tawer might ply\r\nhis trade within the forest bounds outside a borough. Finally every man\r\nabove twelve years of age within the forest district had to swear to\r\nobserve the laws; this applied also to all clerks holding lay fees, and\r\nin many ways the most notable section of the assize is that which\r\ndefinitely asserts the susceptibility of the clergy to the Forest Law\r\nand authorises the royal officers to lay hands on clerical offenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nFINANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nFinance plays as prominent a part in public as in private life, and the\r\nfortunes of a nation are as much built upon a money basis as those of an\r\nindividual. This somewhat obvious truism is particularly applicable to\r\nthe reign of Henry II., owing to the important share taken by hired\r\nmercenary soldiers in his numerous campaigns, the wealth at the king’s\r\ndisposal frequently enabling him to dispense with the service of\r\ndisaffected or untrustworthy vassals. And the main source of this wealth\r\nwas England, or at least it was from England that were drawn those extra\r\nsupplies that formed the critical margin of safety, for while we hear\r\nconstantly of treasure sent from England to the king or his ministers in\r\nNormandy we find no trace of any surplus from Henry’s continental\r\ntreasuries reaching the treasury at Winchester. Fortunately we possess\r\nthe material for our examination in the series of revenue accounts known\r\nas the Pipe Rolls, complete from the second to the last year of the\r\nreign.\r\n\r\nThe treasury, with the controlling machinery of the exchequer, had been\r\nfully organised under Henry I., and an analysis by Sir James Ramsay of\r\nthe one surviving Pipe Roll of that king’s reign, that for the\r\nthirty-first year (1130), shows the total royal revenue to have been\r\nabout £27,000. During the anarchy that prevailed under Stephen’s nominal\r\nsovereignty the organisation of the exchequer virtually fell into\r\nabeyance. While there is no evidence of Stephen having been at any time\r\nin difficulties for lack of money, it is clear that his permanent and\r\nassured revenues must have been very small. The districts in which his\r\npower was sufficiently established to ensure the collection of the royal\r\ndues varied from time to time and at best were limited, while their\r\nyield was still further reduced by the lavish grants of crown demesnes\r\nwith which he had been compelled to purchase the allegiance of powerful\r\nbarons. Henry II., on coming to the throne, had, as we have seen,\r\nresumed possession of the royal demesnes thus alienated, and he also\r\nentrusted the re-organisation of the exchequer to Nigel, Bishop of Ely.\r\nOrder was soon restored, though it was several years before we find the\r\nsame elaboration of the financial network as was exhibited in 1130.\r\n\r\nA careful analysis of the Pipe Roll for 1156, the first of the series,\r\nshows that the total amount of the revenues dealt with, which exclude\r\nthe issues of the three northern counties, still at that time in the\r\nhands of the King of Scotland, was in round figures £21,650. But of this\r\n£6000 has to be deducted for portions of the royal demesnes which had\r\nbeen granted to various persons, and for payments pardoned or remitted\r\nby the king. Another £2250 had not been paid and was still owing, a\r\ncertain proportion being bad debts. Of the remainder, £9120 was paid\r\ninto the treasury in cash and £4260 had been spent by the sheriffs and\r\nother accountants on the king’s behalf in payment of alms, repairs to\r\nbuildings, wages and miscellaneous purchases. The actual revenue of this\r\nyear may therefore be taken as about £13,000, or rather less than half\r\nthat of Henry I. in 1130.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the consideration of the sources of revenue, the first is\r\nthe farms (_firmæ_) of the various counties and honours, these being\r\nfixed sums at which the sheriffs of the counties or the farmers of the\r\nhonours compounded for the issues of the lands under their control. Upon\r\noccasion a county might for some reason be without a sheriff, in which\r\ncase one or more wardens (_custodes_) would be appointed, and they would\r\nanswer in detail for the issues and receive payment in reward for their\r\nservices. In some cases the totals of these issues amount, as we should\r\nexpect, to more than the fixed farm, the difference between the two sums\r\nbeing what the sheriff would have for his labour. But occasionally, and\r\nnotably in the case of London,[44] the yield under _custodes_ was\r\nconsiderably less than under a sheriff. It is hardly conceivable that\r\nthe sheriff, in addition to the labour and responsibility of his\r\nofficial duties, should have been expected to make a loss over the\r\nrender of his farm, but our knowledge of the methods by which the\r\nvarious moneys were collected before they reached the exchequer is too\r\nslight to enable us to explain this phenomenon. An incident which throws\r\nupon the question a light so uncertain as to render it almost more\r\nobscure occurred at the beginning of the Becket controversy. At a\r\ncouncil held at Woodstock in 1163 the king demanded that a certain\r\npayment customarily made to the sheriffs from the lands of the counties\r\nunder their control should in future be entered on the rolls and\r\naccounted for at the exchequer. Archbishop Becket rejected the demand,\r\ndeclaring that the payments in question were voluntary, that they\r\ndepended upon the good conduct of the sheriffs, and that he would never\r\nconsent to pay one penny on this account to the king. The chronicler who\r\nrelates this incident at most length adds that the payment in question\r\nwas two shillings from every hide, but this was almost certainly an\r\nerror due to confusion with the Danegeld; the “sheriff’s aid,” about\r\nwhich the dispute arose, was not levied on any fixed basis but varied in\r\ndifferent parts of the country.[45] So far as we can see, the object of\r\nKing Henry was to make the sheriffs more entirely dependent upon\r\nhimself, drawing them into the position of the _custodes_ as mere\r\nsalaried officials of the exchequer; incidentally, no doubt, he hoped at\r\nthe same time to obtain a substantial increase of revenue by\r\nappropriating the “aid.” The objection voiced by Becket seems to have\r\nbeen based precisely on the king’s wish to make the sheriffs responsible\r\nsolely to himself; under the existing arrangement a sheriff who abused\r\nhis authority ran the risk of losing the emoluments of his office, and\r\neven with this check these officials and their underlings not\r\ninfrequently misused their power, extorting money from those under them\r\nand failing to account at the exchequer for money received. So\r\nnotorious, indeed, did their maladministration become that, as we have\r\nseen, in 1170 Henry was driven to take summary action, removing all the\r\nsheriffs from office and appointing commissions to inquire into their\r\nconduct. Some of the officials thus removed were fined and very few were\r\nrestored to their former position, but the new men appointed do not seem\r\nto have been greatly superior to their predecessors, and it is clear\r\nthat whatever the sheriff lost or made over his farm he certainly\r\npossessed valuable perquisites, both legitimate and of doubtful\r\nlegality.\r\n\r\nThe farms were the only fixed source of revenue, but an uncertain amount\r\ncould always be relied upon from legal procedure (_placita_), fines\r\ninflicted for breaches of either the Common or Forest Law, amercements\r\nlevied on hundreds, tithings, or townships for murders, payments made\r\nfor leave to compound a suit begun in the king’s court, and penalties\r\ndue from the defeated party in a judicial duel. For the most part the\r\nitems under this head were small, though in the aggregate their amount\r\nwas considerable, but not infrequently we find heavy fines inflicted\r\nupon men of wealth, for which no reason is given and which were in some\r\ncases, no doubt, arbitrary acts of extortion on the king’s part. In 1165\r\nEarl Hugh of Norfolk paid half of a fine of 1000 marks, while the Abbot\r\nof St. Edmunds, William Cheyney, and two other East Anglican magnates\r\nwere amerced 200 marks apiece. That same year Hugh de Mortimer was fined\r\n500 marks, the Bishop of Lincoln 400 marks, Ivo de Harcourt 300 marks,\r\nRalf de Cahaignes and Lefwin of York a like amount, the Abbot of\r\nWestminster £100, and Abraham, the Jew of London, £2000. The Jews,\r\nindeed, were a fruitful source of income: their financial genius had\r\nenabled them to concentrate most of the floating capital of the country\r\nin their hands. They had almost as much a monopoly of ready money as\r\nthey had of the trade of usury. In this latter respect their monopoly\r\nwas protected by the ban of the Church directed against Christian\r\nusurers, and, safe from competition, they lent their money at their own\r\nterms, usually about 60 per cent., to litigants, ambitious prelates, or\r\nimpoverished monasteries, at one time financing an unauthorised\r\nexpedition to Ireland and at another assisting the king with large\r\nadvances.[46] Henry was too sensible of their value to persecute, or to\r\npermit his subjects to persecute, the Jews, but he had no scruples in\r\nfining them arbitrarily enormous sums, which might have been crippling\r\nif they had ever paid more than a fraction of them, and in 1188, when he\r\nordered his other subjects to pay a tenth of their goods towards the\r\ncrusade, he made the Jews contribute a quarter instead of a tenth. In\r\nthis latter case one of the London Jews was allowed to compound for his\r\nshare of the subsidy by a payment of £200, of which half was to be paid,\r\nperhaps by the grim humour of the king, on the Sunday on which the\r\ncanticle “Rejoice, O Jerusalem” is sung. It was in the previous year\r\nthat the wealthiest of all the English Jews, the famous Aaron of\r\nLincoln, had died, and by the law relating to usurers, whether Jew or\r\nChristian, his immense possessions, equal apparently to more than the\r\nyearly revenues of the crown, had fallen to the king, only to perish in\r\ngreat part beneath the waves of the Channel.\r\n\r\nIf the death of a usurer brought grist to the king’s mill so did that of\r\na prelate. However inexcusable from a moral point of view the seizure of\r\nthe issues of vacant bishoprics and abbeys may have been, the temptation\r\nmust have been strong. For example, the vacant abbey of Glastonbury in\r\n1181 brought in £600 clear, and next year the see of Lincoln accounted\r\nfor £1290 and that of York for £1260; Canterbury varied from £1100 to\r\n£1500. The farm of the bishopric of Winchester in 1172 was £1555; Ely\r\nproduced nearly £900, and even Bath was worth £425 clear in 1167. Very\r\nfew lay honours approached even the smallest of these sums, but with lay\r\nestates as with clerical the death of the tenant was made a source of\r\nprofit to the king. If the heir were under age he and his lands would be\r\ntaken under the royal protection and either managed directly for the\r\nking’s benefit or granted, for a consideration, to some person of\r\nposition, who might or might not be a relation of the heir, while the\r\ntenant’s widow could be sold in marriage or made to pay heavily for the\r\nright of following her own choice. Even if the heir were of age and\r\nthere were no widow to mulct, the new tenant would have to pay “relief,”\r\nor death duties, graduated on the simple lines of getting the utmost\r\npossible out of the landowner. For small estates the normal rate of\r\n“relief” was £5 for a knight’s fee, the average value of a fee being at\r\nmost £20, but in the case of large estates the amount demanded seems, as\r\nwe have said, to have been arbitrarily fixed by the king. In 1185 as\r\nmuch as 700 marks was demanded of the Countess of Warwick for the\r\nprivilege of having her father’s land, her dower and liberty to remain\r\nsingle. To a certain extent these enormous fines, whether inflicted as\r\nsuccession duties or for other reasons, were _bruta fulmina_, defeating\r\ntheir own ends. Usually the debtor contented himself with paying yearly\r\ninstalments, sometimes round sums and sometimes strangely complicated\r\namounts which suggest a sudden demand from the sheriff satisfied by a\r\nprompt clearance of pockets. The first instalment was as a rule\r\nsubstantial; Fulk Paynel in 1180 paid 200 marks out of the 1000 marks\r\ndemanded of him for the honour of Bampton; but in the same year Adam de\r\nPort only paid £40 out of a similar fine for possession of his lands and\r\nhis wife’s inheritance in Normandy and for restoration to the king’s\r\ngood favour. Fines might thus drag on literally for generations, the\r\ninstalments often showing a tendency to dwindle away until they ceased,\r\nand either the king excused the payment of the rest or the sheriff wrote\r\nit off as a bad debt. Almost any payment on account seems to have been\r\naccepted, and in 1187 William Fitz-Ercenbald, who owed £2156 for arrears\r\nof farm of the silver mines of Carlisle, paid in the rather absurd\r\namount of 13s. 4d.\r\n\r\nAlthough all these sources could be counted upon to yield something\r\nevery year the annual yield varied greatly. There were, however, means\r\nof raising extra occasional revenue, of which the amount could be\r\nforetold with some accuracy. In the first place there was the Danegeld,\r\ndating back to Saxon times. This was a tax of two shillings on every\r\nhide of land as rated in the Domesday Survey. It was levied in 1156,\r\nwhen the accounts show that if it had been collected in full it would\r\nhave amounted to £4550, but owing to extensive remissions and\r\nexemptions, extending to a little over £2000, the total yield was only\r\n£2500. For some unknown reason this tax was only levied once more, in\r\n1162, and was then allowed to fall into disuse. Of more doubtful\r\nlegality but, as a rule, of greater profit were the “aids” (_auxilia_,\r\n_dona_) assessed upon the counties and boroughs from time to time,\r\nregulated apparently by the king’s need of money and the taxable\r\ncapacities of the districts assessed. In 1156 these “aids” yielded\r\n£2100, with a further £100 still owing, while in 1159, according to Sir\r\nJames Ramsay, the amount was well over £5000. On the latter occasion the\r\n“aids” were levied upon bishops, certain of the wealthier lords,\r\nclerical and lay, and Jews as well as upon the boroughs; amongst the\r\nbiggest payments were those of the city of London £1000, Norwich £400,\r\nYork, Lincoln, and Northampton 200 marks each, the Archbishop of York\r\n500 marks, the Bishops of Durham, Winchester, and Lincoln a like amount,\r\nand the Abbot of St. Augustine’s, Canterbury, 220 marks. Two years later\r\nYork again paid 200 marks, but Lincoln had risen and Norwich fallen to\r\n£200, and London escaped with 1000 marks.\r\n\r\nBy feudal custom Henry was entitled to call for an “aid” from his\r\nmilitary tenants on the occasion of his eldest daughter’s marriage, and\r\nin 1168 he availed himself of this right, stretching his demands to\r\ninclude many persons outside the military classes, to whose\r\ncontributions he had no just claim. The similar feudal “aid” for the\r\nknighting of his eldest son was never raised, as the young king was\r\nknighted at the time that he was in opposition to his father. Finally,\r\nin time of war the king could call for Scutage, a monetary composition\r\nin lieu of personal service with the army. The amounts demanded for\r\nScutage varied from one to two marks for the knight’s fee, the larger\r\nsum being exactly equivalent to the wages of a “knight,” or man-at-arms,\r\nfor forty days, the period for which the tenant of a knight’s fee was\r\nbound to serve. Scutage was called for in 1156 for the war with Geoffrey\r\nof Anjou, in 1159 for the Toulouse fiasco, when £2440 is said to have\r\nbeen paid, implying the commutation of the personal service due from\r\n1830 knights, in 1161 and 1162 for war with France, in 1172 for the\r\nIrish expedition, and, finally, in 1175 for the projected expedition to\r\nGalloway. Whether the “assessment for the army in Wales,” raised in\r\n1165, should be considered as a scutage is questionable; it appears to\r\nhave been more of an irregular “aid.”\r\n\r\nHow far the exchequer officials of the period indulged in anticipatory\r\nestimates of revenue, framing their simple and elastic budgets thereon,\r\ncannot be said. Possibly the half-yearly provisional accounts rendered\r\nby the sheriffs at Easter enabled them to foresee whether additional\r\ntaxation would be required to bring the revenue up to the required\r\namount by Michaelmas. Possibly, on the other hand, extra taxation was\r\nput on whenever the balance in the treasury seemed to be getting low.\r\nBut however this may have been, the annual revenue was kept by one means\r\nor another at a pretty constant level. Sir James Ramsay gives the totals\r\nalike for 1159, in which year nearly £8000 were raised by scutage and\r\n“aids,” and for 1169, when no extra taxation was levied, as\r\napproximately £20,000. In 1176 the sum actually paid into the treasury\r\nwas £14,250, while something like £1750 had been spent by the\r\naccountants on the king’s behalf, giving a total of £16,000. To this\r\nhave to be added the enormous sums extorted for breach of the Forest\r\nLaw. The total of the fines inflicted on this score was £13,450, the New\r\nForest accounting for over £2000 and the forests of Yorkshire £1600,\r\nBedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, Wiltshire, Dorset and Somerset and\r\nOxfordshire being all above £1000. But considerably less than half the\r\nsum demanded was paid at the time, and the total for the year may be\r\nestimated as between £5000 and £6000, bringing the revenue up to rather\r\nover £21,000.\r\n\r\nThe money collected by the sheriffs and other officials was accounted\r\nfor every year at Michaelmas at the court of the exchequer. The\r\nexchequer (_scaccarium_) derived its name from the great table covered\r\nwith a black chequered cloth on which the revenue accounts were set out\r\nby means of counters. It must be borne in mind that ability to read and\r\nwrite, though not yet considered as in itself entitling the possessor to\r\n“privilege of clergy,” was so far peculiar to the clergy that a large\r\nproportion of the lay sheriffs would have been unable to keep or to\r\nunderstand written accounts. Even for those more learned the difficulty\r\nof working out complicated sums in Roman numerals must have been\r\nconsiderable, and indeed it is comparatively rare to find any lengthy\r\nmedieval account in which the sums of the items correspond throughout\r\naccurately with the totals given. At the treasury courts, therefore, of\r\nEngland and Normandy, and possibly elsewhere, an elaboration of the\r\n“abacus,” or calculating board, was introduced. This consisted of a\r\ntable, ten feet long by five feet wide, covered with a black cloth on\r\nwhich were drawn seven vertical columns, representing, from right to\r\nleft, pence, shillings, pounds, tens, hundreds, thousands, and tens of\r\nthousands of pounds. These columns in turn were divided by horizontal\r\nlines, cutting the cloth into a series of squares like those on a\r\nchess-board. Within these squares the accounts were set out with\r\ncounters. At the Michaelmas session the chancellor, treasurer, and other\r\nofficials, with their clerks, sat round three sides of the table, while\r\non the other side was the calculating clerk with his counters, and near\r\nhim the sheriff, who may be regarded as his opponent in the game. Along\r\none line the calculator set out the amounts due from the accounting\r\nsheriff, and below it he gradually built up the sheriff’s account,\r\nbeginning with the money paid in in cash and adding item by item the\r\nsums, expended, for which the sheriff produced either the king’s writs\r\nor tallies,[47] the sheriff’s object being to make the two amounts\r\nbalance. In this manner, by ocular demonstration, a long and complicated\r\naccount could be easily followed, while for permanent record all the\r\nitems were entered upon their rolls by the clerks of the chancellor and\r\ntreasurer.\r\n\r\nThe only coin in circulation in England at this time was the silver\r\npenny, and although sums of 12, 160, and 240 pence were spoken of as\r\nshillings, marks, and pounds for convenience of calculation, such units\r\nhad no tangible existence and all money payments were made in pence.\r\nAlthough the money issued during Stephen’s reign was poorly executed,\r\nsuch coins as have survived do not bear out the chroniclers’ assertions\r\nthat it was debased; but it is probable that the total amount of coin in\r\ncirculation was small and that a considerable proportion of it was\r\nforged. In any case Henry had issued a new coinage in 1156, but the\r\nmoneyers appear to have not infrequently debased the silver or made\r\nillegal profits in other ways, and in 1158 many of them had to stand\r\ntheir trial by the ordeal of water and several only escaped mutilation\r\nby the payment of heavy fines. Twenty years later, in 1177, we find what\r\nlooks like an organised conspiracy of fraud amongst the Canterbury\r\nmoneyers, five of their number being fined between them 2500 marks. At\r\nlast, in 1180, Henry entrusted the re-organisation of the coinage to a\r\nforeigner, Philip Aymary, who did his work very well, but so manipulated\r\nthe business to his own profit that he was banished in disgrace. This\r\ncoinage, although possessing no particular artistic merit, was\r\ntechnically a great advance on its predecessor, and was so well\r\nappreciated that it continued to be struck, with hardly noticeable\r\nvariations, under Richard and John and well into the reign of Henry III.\r\nAs a result of forgery, fraud, and the inevitable loss of weight during\r\ncirculation the 240 pence which constituted the nominal pound “by tale,”\r\nor by number, rarely corresponded to the standard pound by weight, and\r\nas many of the sheriffs’ county forms were due in “blanched” money, that\r\nis to say, in pounds of standard fineness and weight, it was necessary\r\nto test the money paid in. To begin with, pence to the value of\r\nforty-four shillings were counted out from the mass of money\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILVER PENNIES\r\n\r\n1. First coinage of Henry II\r\n2. Type introduced in 1180\r\n3. Penny of Henry II struck for Aquitaine\r\n4. Penny of Eleanor as Duchesse of Aquitaine\r\n]\r\n\r\npaid in by the sheriff whose account was under examination. Twenty\r\nshillings of this was then melted down in a crucible and purified by\r\nfire; the resulting ingot was next weighed against the standard pound,\r\nand pence added from the selected money to bring it up to weight; the\r\nnumber of pence required for this purpose having been noted the sheriff\r\nwas charged on all “blanch” sums due that number of pence in addition to\r\neach pound by tale.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass to the consideration of the relative value and purchasing\r\npower of money in the middle of the twelfth century as compared with the\r\npresent time we are met by many complications. The average price of an\r\nox or cow during this reign was from three shillings to four shillings,\r\noccasionally rising as high as five shillings; farm horses fetched three\r\nshillings, but military chargers cost three pounds or more; sheep ranged\r\nfrom fourpence to sixpence and young pigs were about the same, but when\r\nfull-grown they fetched as much as a shilling. A penny a day was the\r\nrecognised wage for a sergeant or private soldier, and eightpence a day\r\nfor a man-at-arms; the master of the royal yacht received a shilling,\r\nthe clerk of the household two shillings, and the chancellor five\r\nshillings a day. Probably we may take the money of that date as roughly\r\nequivalent to twenty-five times the amount in modern currency.\r\n\r\nSo far as the expenditure of the Crown is concerned we labour under\r\nconsiderable difficulties, having no records of the nature of the\r\nLiberate and Issue Rolls of later reigns. The only items of expenditure\r\nwhich have come down to us are such as have been entered upon the Pipe\r\nRolls as discharged by the sheriffs and other officers out of the issues\r\nof their offices. The heaviest of these expenses were incurred in\r\nconnection with building, and especially in the repair and enlargement\r\nof the royal castles. The rebuilding of Scarborough has already been\r\nspoken of, and amongst the scores of entries of work done on castles may\r\nbe mentioned the £1000 spent on Oxford in 1166 and 1167, a sum which is,\r\nhowever, insignificant beside the £4350 spent on Dover Castle between\r\n1182 and 1187, as much as £1248 being spent in the one year 1185.\r\nNottingham, which appears to have been one of the most habitable of the\r\ncastles, accounted for £450 in 1172 and for over £300 in 1175; large\r\nsums were also spent on the king’s hunting seats such as Woodstock,\r\nClipston, and especially Clarendon. For the adornment of Clarendon there\r\nwere provided in 1177 “marble columns,” probably shafts of dark marble\r\nsimilar to those the introduction of which by St. Hugh in his new work\r\nat Lincoln so struck contemporary writers. But numerous as are the\r\nentries of building expenses, they can represent but part of the sums\r\nlaid out by Henry on such operations, nor do we hear anything of the\r\ncost of the army or of the upkeep of the royal household, though we know\r\nfrom the existing list of salaries that this last item must have\r\namounted to about £1500 a year. Whatever were his expenses Henry\r\ncontrived to amass a great fortune, which his successor, Richard, found\r\nlittle difficulty in dissipating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH NATION UNDER HENRY II\r\n\r\n\r\nSociety in England during Henry’s reign might be considered as arranged\r\nin three groups: (1) The Military Class, with the king at its head,\r\nranging from the semi-independent earl to the humble tenant of some\r\nfraction of a knight’s fee. (2) The Merchants and Traders--dwellers in\r\ncities and seaports, from the wealthy councillor to the humble\r\napprentice. (3) The Peasantry--the comfortable yeoman, the farm\r\nlabourer, whose theoretical lack of freedom often sat but lightly upon\r\nhim, and the hired servants. From this third class the two superior\r\nclasses were completed. They formed the nameless ranks of archers and\r\nfoot soldiers who bore the brunt of many a battle, and, unprotected by\r\ncoat of mail or prospect of ransom, paid forfeit for defeat with their\r\nlives, and they were the hardy sailors, serving the merchants in time of\r\npeace, but ever ready to convert their ships into men-of-war. It might\r\nseem that the clergy should form a fourth class, but they really fall\r\ninto the same three divisions as the laity. The prelates and\r\ndignitaries, holding their lands by military service and bound to\r\nprovide so many knights for the king’s army, sometimes leading their\r\ntroops in person; then, opposed to these sons of the Church Militant,\r\nthe monks and canons of the religious orders, intent on the business of\r\nreligion, not wholly averse to trading spiritual for material blessings,\r\nand displaying some skill in laying up treasure in this life as well as\r\nfor the next; and finally the poor, but not always honest, parish\r\npriests and unattached clerks, the hardest workers and the worst paid,\r\nlittle above the secular peasantry from whose ranks they sprang, their\r\nmany virtues unrecorded and the excesses of their unworthy members\r\npilloried. If a fourth group did exist it consisted of the officials,\r\nblending the characteristics of clerks, soldiers, and merchants--men\r\nprepared at a moment’s notice to hear pleas, superintend the purchase\r\nand despatch of stores, or take command of a force of soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe king’s supremacy in his court was indisputable; his greatest nobles\r\nwere proud to serve him, and quick to resent any infringement of their\r\nrights of service. Thus the Earl of Arundel, hereditary chief butler,\r\nreturning from a long journey just as the two kings, Henry and Louis,\r\nwere sitting down to dinner, strode into the hall, flung off his cloak\r\nand seized the royal goblet from the acting butler, who resisting, the\r\npowerful earl knocked him down and presented the wine on bended knee to\r\nhis royal master, explaining apologetically to the French king that it\r\nwas his privilege and that the deputy butler ought to have withdrawn\r\nwithout protest. So also, at a later date, William de Tancarville,\r\nchamberlain of Normandy, forcibly possessed himself of the basin and\r\newer which another courtier was carrying to the king. Yet was Henry the\r\nmost accessible of men; out of doors he suffered his subjects to crowd\r\nround him and speak to him freely, in his court he was almost always\r\nready to give informal audience to all who sought him, and it was only\r\nat the very door of his bedchamber that a messenger would be challenged.\r\nMen of wit, such as Walter Map, the cynical canon of St. Paul’s, might\r\nbreak in on his conversation with a humorous or sarcastic comment\r\nunrebuked, and Henry could even take in good part the public reprimand\r\naddressed to him by an obscure monk of his neglected priory of Witham.\r\nThe English court under Henry attracted scholars of European fame, and\r\non the lighter side of literature we find the king encouraging Gerald de\r\nBarri, the proto-journalist, listening amusedly to his anecdotes and\r\nbantering him, giving money to “Maurice the story-teller”\r\n(_fabulatori_), and replying with mock seriousness to the heroics\r\npurporting to be addressed to him by King Arthur.\r\n\r\nIf his nobles did not share the king’s literary tastes they were at\r\nleast in tune with him on the subject of sport. Hunting and hawking were\r\nthe recreations of the English and Norman nobility, and in his devotion\r\nthereto Henry yielded to none of his subjects. The keepers of his hounds\r\nformed not the most insignificant part of his retinue; hawks were\r\nprocured for him from Norway and from Ireland and passed as presents\r\nbetween himself and foreign princes; when he went out of England,\r\nwhether for peaceful cause or war, his hawks and hounds and huntsmen\r\nfollowed him. His sons also, like all the magnates of their days, were\r\ndevotees of the chase, but the two elder found greater pleasure in the\r\nsport of war, and the young King Henry in particular shone as the patron\r\nof the tournament. The gradual repression of private warfare, at least\r\nbetween the smaller lords, had deprived life of much of its excitement,\r\nand the more warlike spirits sought to counteract what they no doubt\r\nconsidered the softness and degeneracy of the age by the institution of\r\ntournaments, a species of private war cleansed of personal rancour and\r\nlacking the disastrous consequences to lands and tenants involved by the\r\nreal thing. To picture the tournament of this date as resembling the\r\nformal and chivalrous jousting in the lists of later centuries would be\r\ncompletely misleading. For the most part the frequenters of these\r\nmeetings were landless men, younger sons and needy adventurers, intent\r\nsolely, or at least mainly, on making money by the capture of opponents,\r\nwhose chargers and armour then became their own, and whose bodies might\r\nbe held to ransom. It was no shame for ten to set on one, and William\r\nthe Marshal, one of the most brilliant of these adventurers and the\r\ninstructor of the young king, gained praise by the skill with which he\r\nlet his adversaries exhaust themselves before he flung his forces upon\r\nthem. This same Marshal, who went with another knight on a pot-hunting\r\nexpedition during which they accounted for 103 knights, besides extra\r\nchargers, on one occasion saw one of the opposing knights thrown by his\r\nhorse and lying on the ground, disabled with a broken thigh; rushing out\r\nof the tent where he was dining he picked up the injured man and bore\r\nhim back into the tent, handing him over a prisoner to his companions\r\n“to pay their debts with.” In this particular instance there was no\r\ndoubt an element of rough humour, but the whole spirit of the tournament\r\nwas practical and unromantic, though fame and glory were sought at the\r\nsame time as wealth, and the Marshal would have set a higher value upon\r\nhis reputation for skill and courage than upon the fund of ready money\r\nfor which he was remarkable at a time when steel and silver were rarely\r\nfound together.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the tournament pervaded the field of battle, and so far as\r\nthe knightly combatants were concerned their chief aim was to capture\r\nand hold to ransom their adversaries rather than to kill them. Such lust\r\nof slaughter as they felt was satisfied at the expense of the\r\nunfortunate infantry, drawn from the ranks of the peasants and yeomen\r\nand not worth ransoming. After a desperate and decisive battle the\r\nchroniclers will recount a long list of knights captured, but it is rare\r\nindeed that any are recorded to have fallen in battle, and on such rare\r\noccasions it was usually by the hand of a common foot soldier or by a\r\nchance arrow. It was precisely this tradition of the respect due to\r\ngentle blood that made the Norman knights so useless against the Welsh\r\nor Irish, who ignored their gentility and fought to kill.\r\n\r\nHenry’s genius for organisation found scope in military matters as\r\nelsewhere. During the reigns of the Saxon kings the _fyrd_ or national\r\nmilitia, theoretically consisting of all the able-bodied male\r\npopulation, was always liable to be called out in time of war, and this\r\nliability had remained in force after the Conquest. Under William the\r\nConqueror the country had been parcelled out into estates, great and\r\nsmall, the tenants of which held by the service of supplying a fixed\r\nquota of knights, in no way proportionate to the size or value of the\r\nestate, to serve in the royal army for forty days when required. It has\r\nbeen already pointed out that Henry II. encouraged the system of\r\ncommuting personal service for a money payment, and in order to\r\nascertain the exact amount of service due he caused a general return to\r\nbe made by his military tenants in 1166. They were required to state how\r\nmany knights they were bound to find, and as there were two ways of\r\nproviding for these knights, either by granting them land in return for\r\ntheir services when required or by hiring them as occasion demanded, a\r\ndistinction was to be drawn between the knights enfeoffed and those\r\nchargeable on the demesnes. A further distinction was to be made\r\nbetween those knights already enfeoffed at the time of the death of\r\nHenry I. and those of newer feoffment. In many cases the greater barons\r\nhad enfeoffed more knights than they were bound to supply, probably for\r\nthe most part during Stephen’s reign, with the intention of augmenting\r\ntheir own private forces, and Henry claimed that they should pay scutage\r\non this larger number of knights instead of on their original quota, a\r\nclaim which was strenuously resisted.\r\n\r\nFor the re-organisation of the national forces an Assize of Arms was\r\nissued in England in 1181. Every holder of a knight’s fee or of rents\r\nand property to the value of sixteen marks was to keep a coat of mail, a\r\nhelmet, a shield, and a lance; the owner of property worth ten marks\r\nshould have a hauberk, an iron headpiece, and a lance, and all burgesses\r\nand the whole body of freemen should have a quilted jacket (_wambais_),\r\nan iron headpiece, and a lance. These arms were never to be parted with,\r\nbut to descend from father to son; but in order to render the supply\r\nmore accessible it was ordered that no burgess should keep more arms\r\nthan his statutory quota, and if he had others should give or sell them\r\nto those that required them; at the same time Jews were forbidden to\r\nretain coats of mail and hauberks, presumably the most expensive\r\nportions of the outfit. From the absence of any mention of horses it has\r\nbeen assumed by some writers that all these troops were expected to\r\nfight on foot, but this is undoubtedly an error; presumably the\r\nprovision of a horse was left to the discretion of the soldier, and\r\npractically the whole of the first class and a large proportion of the\r\nsecond would have been mounted men. Another noteworthy omission is that\r\nof the bow; some thirty years later the holder of property worth twenty\r\nshillings was required to provide a bow and arrows, but at this time it\r\nwould seem that the bow was regarded as unworthy of a freeman and its\r\nuse confined to the villein soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe justices itinerant were to publish this assize in the different\r\ncounty courts and to make it known that any defaulter would pay for his\r\nfault with his body and by no means escape with fine or forfeiture. At\r\nthe same time the justices were to hold inquiries by juries of freemen\r\nof good standing as to the persons in the several hundreds and boroughs\r\nwho held property worth sixteen marks or ten marks, to draw up lists of\r\nsuch persons and to swear them to the observance of the assize.\r\n\r\nThe final article of the Assize of Arms directed that no one should buy\r\nor sell any ship to be taken away from England, or export timber. In\r\nthis decree we have evidence of Henry’s comprehension of the value of a\r\nstrong navy to the country. In speaking of a strong navy it must not be\r\nsupposed that any royal force of fighting ships existed or was even\r\ncontemplated at this time. Such naval organisation as existed was almost\r\nentirely confined to the federation of the Cinque Ports. The origin and\r\nearly history of this federation is very obscure, but it seems clear\r\nthat Hastings and Dover and probably the other three ports of Sandwich,\r\nHythe, and Romney, were bound together by the possession of common\r\nprivileges and common responsibilities in the reign of Edward the\r\nConfessor. Hastings was the undoubted head of this group of ports and\r\nthe first to acquire privileges at the royal court and in connection\r\nwith the herring fishery at Yarmouth which were afterwards extended to\r\nthe other members. When the title of the Cinque Ports was assumed has\r\nnot yet been discovered, but it was clearly established by the beginning\r\nof the reign of Henry II., as in 1161 we find a payment of £34, 17s. to\r\nthe ships of “the five ports” which conveyed treasure across the\r\nchannel. As one main division of the English fleet employed in the\r\nexpedition against Lisbon in 1147 was referred to as the “Hastingenses,”\r\nalmost certainly alluding to the ships of the allied ports, it would\r\nseem that the title was first officially recognised under Henry II. The\r\nbonds of union were still so loose that the separate ports and their\r\naffiliated members received separate charters. One of these, of quite\r\nuncertain date, issued by Henry at Westminster, confirmed to the\r\n“barons” of Hastings their privileges at court, exemption from customs\r\nand other dues, and the foreshore rights of “strand and den” at\r\nYarmouth, in return for the provision of twenty ships for fifteen days\r\nwhen required. Henry also granted similar exemptions to the two\r\n“ancient towns” of Rye and Winchelsea, affiliating them to Hastings, to\r\nwhose quota of twenty ships they were to send two; they were further\r\nexempted from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and might be\r\nimpleaded only in the same manner as the barons of Hastings and of the\r\nCinque Ports. This privilege of a separate court was clearly of early\r\ndate, as in another charter given during the first six years of Henry’s\r\nreign to the men of Hythe he ordered that they should not plead\r\nelsewhere than they were used to do, namely at the Shipway.\r\n\r\nAs a result of grants and confirmations of privileges the king could\r\nrely at need upon a force of some sixty ships. The ships themselves were\r\nthe ordinary fishing and trading vessels of the channel ports, small but\r\nseaworthy, easily converted into fighting ships by the erection of\r\nwooden fore and stern castles and manned by hardy and experienced\r\nsailors. But for all their experience the little ships with their single\r\nsquare sail were not very manageable in a storm and the tale of\r\nshipwrecks was large. When used for transport purposes it would seem\r\nthat about a hundred soldiers could be carried by each vessel. The\r\nCinque Port vessels were bound to carry a crew of twenty-one, but this\r\nwas apparently an exceptional complement, as in the levy of ships for\r\nthe Irish expedition of 1171 the average crew was twelve men and a\r\nmaster, such crews being carried by the thirty-six ships from Norfolk\r\nand Suffolk, the seven from Dorset and Somerset, six from Devon, two\r\nfrom London, and one from Herefordshire; on the other hand the\r\ntwenty-eight ships supplied by Gloucestershire averaged only six men,\r\nbut eight from Sussex nineteen, and two from Hampshire twenty-two\r\napiece. During the troubles of 1173 most of the ships which were “sent\r\nto Sandwich to meet the ships of the Cinque Ports” carried crews of\r\ntwenty or upwards, and the two vessels from Colchester carried sixty\r\nseamen between them. Probably the numbers were raised at this time in\r\nanticipation of attack, as we find that an extra force of from ten to\r\ntwenty men was put on board the king’s yacht each time it crossed with\r\ntreasure this year. This royal yacht was the only vessel permanently\r\nretained in the king’s service, naval forces being collected as required\r\nfrom the Cinque Ports and other coast towns, though there were at\r\nSouthampton certain private ship-owners whose vessels were so often\r\nchartered for national service that they might almost be held to have\r\nconstituted a miniature royal navy in embryo.\r\n\r\nSouthampton was at this time the chief mercantile port of England,\r\npre-eminent for its valuable wine trade, thanks alike to the natural\r\nadvantages of its situation relative to Normandy and the wine-exporting\r\ndistricts of the west, and to its proximity to the royal city of\r\nWinchester. Although London had already outdistanced Winchester in\r\nwealth the latter was still the home of the treasury, the rival of\r\nWestminster as the king’s official residence, and a leading centre of\r\ntrade. The great fair of St. Giles drew merchants from all over England\r\nand from foreign lands to Winchester, to sell their fine worked stuffs\r\nto the king’s purveyors for his royal robes or to buy the coarse woollen\r\ncloth of local manufactures, for Winchester with its gilds of weavers\r\nand fullers was a great seat of the cloth industry, most of its products\r\nbeing the coarse “burrell” cloth of which two thousand ells were\r\npurchased and sent to Ireland in 1171 for the troops. A cheaper and\r\ncoarser cloth seems to have been made in Cornwall, as on several\r\noccasions Cornish “burrells” in large quantities were bought for the\r\nking’s almoner. The output of English cloth was altogether more\r\nremarkable for quantity than quality; gilds of weavers existed in 1156\r\nat Winchester, London, Lincoln, Oxford, Huntingdon, and Nottingham, all\r\nbeing of sufficient importance to pay yearly to the king from 40s. to\r\n£6, but their productions were for the most part poor and coarse, with\r\nthe notable exception of the scarlet cloths of Lincoln, which are found\r\nfetching the prodigious price of 6s. 8d. the ell. So far as there were\r\nexceptions to the general lack of quality they were no doubt due to\r\nforeign, especially to Flemish, influence. At the time of the expulsion\r\nof the Flemings after the rebellion of 1173 there are numerous entries\r\non the Pipe Rolls recording seizures of wool and woad belonging to\r\nFlemings; the dyers of Worcester are recorded as owing £12 to the\r\nking’s Flemish enemies, and there is other evidence to show the presence\r\nof these skilled clothworkers throughout the country.\r\n\r\nFor foreign trade, statistics, and even such details as would permit of\r\nbroad generalisations, are lacking. There was no imposition of customs\r\nfor revenue purposes by the central authorities; each town, whether\r\nseaport or inland market, had its own schedule of customs and _octroi_\r\ndues, but they were only under the control of the Crown in so far that\r\nthe king could by charter exempt persons from the payment of such dues\r\nthroughout the realm. Such exemptions were amongst the most valued\r\nfranchises of the barons of the Cinque Ports, the men of a few\r\nprivileged boroughs, and the tenants of certain great religious houses.\r\nA trading privilege of particular interest for its bearing upon the\r\ndevelopment of London under Norman influence was the right of the\r\ncitizens of Rouen to a port or anchorage in the Thames close to the city\r\nwalls, which was confirmed to them by Henry II. in 1174. A still more\r\nstriking instance of the connection of two ports was Henry’s grant of\r\nDublin to the burgesses of Bristol, assuring to them a virtual monopoly\r\nof the Irish trade, which they appear to have previously shared with\r\nChester, the monopoly of the Irish trade with Normandy being in the same\r\nway assured to Rouen. As a whole Henry’s policy towards the towns and\r\ntrading communities, especially in the earlier years of his reign, was\r\nliberal and encouraging; we find him granting the customs of York to\r\nthe burgesses of Scarborough in 1155, the liberties of London and\r\nWinchester to the men of Gloucester, and the customs of Lincoln to the\r\nburgesses of Coventry at a later date; gilds merchant and trade gilds\r\nwere confirmed in their privileges at Oxford, Nottingham, Lincoln, and\r\nelsewhere, and the formation of others licensed. With the growth of\r\ntrade other unauthorised gilds sprang up, and in 1180 no fewer than\r\nnineteen such “adulterine” gilds were reported in London alone, five of\r\nthem being connected with London Bridge, the famous stone bridge built\r\nin 1176. Of these London gilds the only four definitely identified with\r\nspecial trades were those of the goldsmiths, spicers, butchers, and\r\nclothworkers, the others being, no doubt, social and religious societies\r\nof a less specialised composition.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the growth of manufactures developed the exploitation\r\nof the mineral wealth of England. The lead mines of Derbyshire,\r\nYorkshire, and Shropshire were being worked, and the valuable\r\nsilver-bearing lead mines of Carlisle, which were farmed in 1158 for 100\r\nmarks, were bringing in 150 marks at the end of the reign, having\r\nfluctuated between 500 marks in 1166 and no yield at all after the\r\nborder wars of 1173-4. At the other end of the kingdom were the rich tin\r\nmines of Cornwall and Devon. Iron was worked in the northern counties\r\nand to some extent in Northamptonshire, but the industry had not yet\r\nattained any degree of importance in the Weald of Sussex and Kent, and\r\nthe Forest of Dean enjoyed a practical monopoly of the southern iron\r\ntrade. Tin was undoubtedly exported to the Continent, lead we read of as\r\nsent by King Henry for the use of the monks of Clairvaux; but it is\r\ndoubtful whether it was to any extent an article of commerce, and iron\r\nwas almost certainly not exported.\r\n\r\nBy a curious inversion of later practice the chief exports from England\r\nin early times were the raw materials of wool and hides and a certain\r\namount of food stuffs. Amongst the latter were no doubt cheeses, which\r\nhad already found a market in Flanders in the eleventh century, and\r\npossibly ale, for which England, and especially Kent, was celebrated. In\r\n1168 we find fifty-three hogsheads of ale sent to the king in Normandy,\r\nand that this drink was appreciated by foreigners we may conclude from\r\nits having occupied so prominent a part amongst the gifts which Becket\r\ncarried with him on his famous embassy to the French court. While ale\r\nwas the national drink, no small quantity of wine was grown in England,\r\nvineyards existing in the southern counties from Kent to Hereford, and\r\nat least as far north as Cambridgeshire, and references to cider are\r\nalso numerous.\r\n\r\nThe preference given to cider over Kentish ale was one of the charges of\r\nluxury brought by Gerald de Barri against his monastic entertainers at\r\nthe cathedral priory of Christchurch, Canterbury. How far the\r\naccusations of excess, in food and in other matters, brought by Gerald\r\nand by Walter Map against the monks, and in particular against those of\r\nthe Cistercian order, could be sustained is a question difficult to\r\nanswer. Both men bore personal grudges against the Cistercians, both\r\npreferred a scandalous story or a witty jest to strict accuracy, and\r\nGerald especially was utterly unscrupulous in the abuse of his enemies.\r\nAt the same time some of the little details in the stories told seem to\r\nsupport their accuracy, and there is evidence that in many cases abuses\r\nhad crept in and ascetic ideals been relaxed with a rapidity which is\r\nastonishing when it is remembered that Bernard of Clairvaux, the founder\r\nof the order, had died only the year before Henry ascended the throne.\r\nOne of Gerald’s tales relates how an abbot of one of the English\r\nCistercian houses hospitably regaled the king, not knowing him, with a\r\ndrinking bout, initiating him into the mysteries of “Pril” and “Vril,”\r\nthe private toasts, or drinking cries, used in the monastery in place of\r\nthe secular “Washeil” and “Drinkheil,” and how Henry, when the abbot\r\nsubsequently came to court, welcomed him with “Pril” and made him repeat\r\nthe performance, to his utter confusion and the intense amusement of the\r\nnobles. The possibility of this being a true story is increased when we\r\nread in the Cistercian annals a generation later that in 1215 the Abbot\r\nof Beaulieu was deposed because he behaved outrageously at table,\r\ndrinking hilariously, in the presence of three earls and forty knights,\r\nand that, two years later, the Abbot of Tintern drank ceremoniously\r\n(_solemniter_) with bishops and monks. Of the purely English order of\r\nGilbertines, whose founder, Gilbert of Sempringham, died in 1181, Gerald\r\nspeaks favourably, though deprecating their system of double convents\r\nfor nuns and canons, but it is only of the austere Carthusians and\r\nGrammontanes that he writes with whole-hearted commendation. That his\r\npraise was justified is confirmed by the exceptional favour shown to\r\nthese two orders by Henry, who troubled little about other religious,\r\nsave the nuns of Fontevrault and the military order of the Templars.\r\n\r\nGluttony and drunkenness were indeed vices in their addiction to which\r\nthe English, both clergy and laity, compared unfavourably with their\r\nWelsh and Irish contemporaries. William Fitz-Stephen, in his famous\r\ndescription of London, gives “the immoderate drinking of fools” as one\r\nof the two “plagues” of the city. The degree of luxury then prevalent at\r\ntable is indicated by his account of the public cook-shop on the river\r\nbank near the wine wharves, where every variety of fish, flesh, and\r\nfowl, roast meat, baked meat, stew and pasty was ever preparing. Hither\r\nran the servants of those upon whose empty larders unexpected guests had\r\ndescended; here was store sufficient to satisfy an army of knights or a\r\nband of pilgrims; here an epicure might call for sturgeon, woodcock, or\r\nortolan. It was a gay, busy, prosperous city, ships of all nations\r\nloading and unloading, crowds chaffering with the merchants and\r\ntradesmen, whose stalls were congregated according to kind; here the\r\nbooths of the goldsmiths, and here a street of cloth merchants; here the\r\ngrocers, and here a row of cutlers, while through the narrow, irregular\r\nstreets, scattering purchasers and loafers, would pass the retinue of\r\nsome prelate or baron on the way to his town house. Then there was the\r\nweekly excitement of the horse fair held outside the city walls on the\r\nflat fields of Smithfield; every one was there, come to buy, to sell, or\r\nto look on, and there were horses to suit every conceivable want, at\r\nleast if you accepted the word of their owners; here were ambling nags,\r\nunbroken colts, of whose heels you had better be careful, stately\r\nchargers, sturdy pack horses, mares with their foals, cart horses,\r\ndriving horses, horses innumerable. But the fun really began when, with\r\na sudden shouting, the crowd parted hastily and left a clear course down\r\nwhich thundered the chargers in mad race, scarcely needing the shouts\r\nand spurring of their boy jockeys to urge them to their utmost effort.\r\nAnd then there were the holidays, when the fields outside the city were\r\nthronged with students, chaffing each other and lampooning their\r\nteachers with apt Latinity, young nobles from the court at Westminister,\r\nand apprentices from the city, while their elders looked on and grew\r\nyounger with excitement as they watched them cock-fighting,\r\nball-playing, or tilting; and as the day wore on the girls would come to\r\nthe fore and there would be song and dancing until the moon rose. Or the\r\nscene would shift to the river, where the boys, standing in the bows of\r\na boat, would tilt at a shield suspended above the water and win either\r\nthe applause or more often the laughter of the watchers on the bridge\r\nand in the riverside houses by their efforts to maintain their balance\r\nand avoid a ducking. And then in the winter, when the marshes were\r\ncovered with ice, bone skates were in demand, and tilting on skates\r\nwarmed the blood even if it was responsible for rather a large number of\r\nbroken heads and limbs. For those who were too old, too timid, or too\r\ndignified for such boisterous sports there were the pleasures of hunting\r\nand hawking over the great preserves belonging to the city in\r\nHertfordshire, Middlesex, and Kent. A gay city, but one whose gaiety was\r\nonly too often suddenly checked by an outbreak of fire, the second of\r\nFitz-Stephen’s “plagues.” With their wooden hovels, wooden booths, and\r\nprimitive open hearths the English towns were constant sufferers from\r\nfire. Becket’s parents had been impoverished by a succession of fires,\r\nand in one year, 1161, London, Canterbury, Winchester, and Exeter were\r\ndevastated; next year the booths of St. Giles’ fair at Winchester were\r\nburnt with all the merchandise in them, and in 1180 a fire beginning at\r\nthe mint destroyed the greater part of the unfortunate town of\r\nWinchester; Glastonbury was burnt in 1184 and Chichester in 1187; and\r\nthese are only instances recorded for the magnitude of destruction\r\nwrought; smaller outbreaks must have been of continual occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe description of London, _mutatis mutandis_, would apply sufficiently\r\nwell to other towns of the period, though in many of the smaller\r\nboroughs the mercantile element must be almost eliminated and a large\r\nagricultural element introduced to render the picture even tolerably\r\nfaithful. But when we get outside the walls of the towns we meet with\r\nquite a different state of affairs. Here and there a castle or the chief\r\nseat of some powerful landowner would present us with a building of some\r\narchitectural importance, but in far the greater number of cases the\r\nchief house, the manor, would be a barn-like structure of one storey,\r\nthe main feature of which would be the hall, or living room, with the\r\nmassive beams of its open roof blackened by the smoke from the fire\r\nburning on an open hearth in the centre of the hall. The chamber, or\r\nsleeping apartment, a similar but smaller room connected with the first\r\nby a lobby or vestibule, would possibly be partitioned into cubicles\r\neither by lath and plaster walls or by cloth hangings. The kitchen, with\r\nbrew-house, wash-house, dairy and other offices, where such existed,\r\nmight form part of the main buildings or be in a block by themselves,\r\nand there would be one or two barns, with cart-houses, stables,\r\ncow-sheds, hen-houses, pig-styes and the miscellaneous appurtenances of\r\na farm. The roofs of the various buildings would be thatched and the\r\nwindows unglazed, closed with wooden shutters; on the floor would be a\r\nlayer of rushes, not too frequently renewed, and one or two trestle\r\ntables, some benches and stools; a cupboard and possibly a couple of\r\nmassive chests would pretty nearly exhaust the catalogue of the\r\nfurniture, save for the wooden platters and bowls, buckets and barrels\r\nin the kitchen. Near the manor house as a rule would stand the church,\r\nmassive and dark, its walls adorned with crudely realistic paintings and\r\nits stonework enriched with the strong, barbaric mouldings of the\r\nperiod, and hard by, overshadowed by the tithe barn, would be the house\r\nof the parish priest, little superior to the clusters of mud huts in\r\nwhich the peasantry contrived to exist.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a true estimate of the position of the peasantry at this time\r\nit is essential to grasp the entirely different standard of life then\r\nprevalent. Comfort and happiness are mainly matters of comparison, and\r\nat a time when the country gentleman was content with a simplicity which\r\na modern artisan would scorn the labourer might well see no discomfort\r\nin conditions against which an Irish peasant would protest. A condition\r\nof servitude was no great burden in itself to those upon whose\r\nimaginations the theoretical beauty of liberty had not dawned. The\r\ngradations between free and bond were so fine that it required a skilled\r\nlawyer to draw the line that separated them, and in practice many\r\nfreemen were worse off than the average villein. If villeinage legally\r\nbound the tenant to perform irksome service for his lord it morally\r\nbound the lord to provide for his tenant. At the same time the services\r\nexacted from the villein were arduous; in theory they were unlimited,\r\nbut in practice custom had already fixed their nature in most manors.\r\nStriking a rough average, we may say that a villein as a rule had to\r\nwork for his lord one day in each week for every five or ten acres that\r\nhe held, and in addition to put in a number of extra days during the\r\nbusy and critical weeks of harvest and further occasional days for\r\nploughing, harrowing, and sowing. Then there were occasions when he\r\nmight be called upon to help in thatching the farm buildings, carting\r\nmanure, repairing hedges, carrying farm produce to market or fetching\r\nsalt, or such local requirements as the drying and salting of herrings.\r\nFor many of these extra services he had some return in the shape of a\r\nmeal at the lord’s cost, but the demands upon his time were heavy and\r\nwould have left him little opportunity to cultivate his own small\r\nholding if he had no sons or others to assist him.\r\n\r\nThe lot of the people, villein, landowner, and burgess had improved\r\nunder the wise rule of Henry, and even the great lords, if shorn of\r\ntheir power, were safe from the attacks of rivals and secure of their\r\npossessions so long as they remained loyal. The seeds of the English\r\nConstitution had been sown. The English nation, which had been nursed,\r\nin part unwittingly, by Henry, was to discover its own existence under\r\nhis successors when his foreign policy failed and the connection between\r\nNormandy and England was severed. The relations between Church and State\r\nwere settled upon a firm basis, and if the supremacy of the State, for\r\nwhich Henry had fought, had to be abandoned, the Catholic Church in\r\nEngland developed a consciousness of nationality and remained\r\nindependent of Rome in a degree quite exceptional when compared with the\r\nChurch on the Continent. As the effects of Henry’s policy were either\r\nevanescent and negligible or enduring, and in the latter case easy to\r\ntrace, it is not hard to estimate the significance of his reign, but to\r\nobtain a just estimate of the man himself is more difficult. For the\r\nmore intimate details we are largely dependent upon men who either bore\r\nhim ill-will or, more rarely, were writing in a spirit of flattery, but\r\nputting the evidence together we see a strong, clear-headed man,\r\ncontrolling his emotions but occasionally clearing off accumulations of\r\nirritation and annoyance by tremendous outbursts of mad rage; a\r\nmethodical man with a keen sense of justice, but arbitrary and\r\nunscrupulous; a skilled general who never engaged in warfare if it\r\ncould be avoided; a keen and restless sportsman with a sense of humour\r\nand a passion for literature; a free-thinking adulterer with a genuine\r\nappreciation of purity and true religion; a king who could manage the\r\naffairs of half-a-dozen principalities but could not rule his own house;\r\nan acute judge of men, who lavished affection and benefits upon\r\nungrateful and unworthy sons; a mass of contradictions; in other words,\r\nan entirely human man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORDS\r\n\r\nFor the whole period covered by the reign of Henry II. the English\r\nnational archives are fortunate in the possession of the unique series\r\nof Pipe Rolls. On these annual account rolls were entered in detail the\r\nissues of all the counties, escheats, vacant sees and other lands farmed\r\nfor the Crown. The details of these payments, including “relief” paid by\r\nthe heirs of deceased tenants in chief, amercements for innumerable\r\noffences and other miscellaneous information, are most valuable to the\r\ngenealogist, topographer, and constitutional historian, but of greater\r\nvalue to the general historian are the balancing items of money expended\r\nby the sheriffs upon building operations, hiring ships, provisioning\r\ntroops, entertaining members of the royal family or ambassadors from\r\nforeign courts, and in a hundred other different ways. From these it is\r\npossible in many cases to follow the king’s movements, while often the\r\ndetails given throw a cold, impartial light, corroborative or\r\ncorrective, upon the prejudiced or distorted statements of the\r\nchroniclers. Of the corresponding Pipe Rolls for Normandy only that for\r\n1180 and a fragment for 1185 have survived.\r\n\r\nA large number of royal _Charters_ of this period have survived and are\r\nof great value to the antiquary, though, for the most part, they yield\r\nlittle to the general historian. The _Calendars of Charter Rolls_, Mr.\r\nRound’s _Calendar of Documents preserved in France_, and the _Monasticon\r\nAnglicanum_ contain the most important collections of these charters.\r\nWith practically no exceptions the charters of Henry II. are undated\r\nand can only be assigned to their years by a careful examination of the\r\nattesting signatures, but M. Leopold Delisle in a series of articles in\r\nthe _Bibliothèque de l’École des Chartes_ (1906-1908) claims that the\r\ncharters prior to 1173 can be at once distinguished from those of later\r\ndate by the absence from the king’s title of the formula _Dei gratia_,\r\nwhich is invariably found from 1173 onwards. This theory has been\r\ndisputed, but the weight of evidence is in favour of M. Delisle.\r\n\r\nSurveys of the manors and churches belonging to the canons of St.\r\nPaul’s, made in 1181 (printed in the _Domesday of St. Paul’s_ by the\r\nCamden Society), and of the possessions of the Knights Templars in 1185\r\n(Exch. K. R., Misc. Books, vol. 16) are of interest for the light thrown\r\nupon land tenure and agricultural life in general, and further\r\nparticulars can be gleaned from the many monastic cartularies, printed\r\nand manuscript, which exist. Most important, perhaps, of all this class\r\nof records is the “Boldon Book,” an elaborate survey of the possessions\r\nof the see of Durham in 1183, which has been fully treated by Dr.\r\nLapsley in the _Victoria History of the County of Durham_.\r\n\r\n_The Red Book of the Exchequer_, which has been printed in the Rolls\r\nSeries, contains the important returns of knights’ fees made in 1166 and\r\nthe “Constitutio Domus Regis,” an account of persons composing the\r\nking’s household, their wages and perquisites, originally compiled in\r\nthe reign of Henry I., but equally applicable to the court of Henry II.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONICLES\r\n\r\nFor the acts of Henry prior to his accession we are mainly dependent\r\nupon the concise records of the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ and Henry of\r\nHuntingdon, with the valuable addition of the more detailed _Gesta\r\nStephani_.\r\n\r\nFor the general history of the reign the _Chronicles_ of Robert of\r\nTorigny, Abbot of Mont St. Michel, down to 1186, in which year he died,\r\nand the _History_ of William of Newburgh are two of the most reliable\r\nsources. From 1170 onwards we have the valuable aid of the _Gesta\r\nHenrici_, known by the name of Abbot Benedict of Peterborough, which is\r\nincorporated in the _Chronicles_ of Roger of Hoveden. The works of Ralph\r\nde Diceto, Dean of St. Paul’s, and of Gervase of Canterbury are for the\r\nmost part compilations based upon other writers, but each contain a few\r\nfacts not found elsewhere. The _Annales Monastici_ and other monastic\r\nchronicles printed in the Rolls Series and the _Annales Angevines_\r\n(_Collection de Textes_) supply a few occasional details of local events\r\nand serve to corroborate the more important works.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the literature concerned with the Becket controversy has\r\nbeen collected in the seven volumes of Canon J. C. Robertson’s\r\n_Materials for the History of Thomas Becket_ in the Rolls Series. These\r\ncontain the _Lives_ by William of Canterbury, including a long list of\r\nMiracles, Benedict of Peterborough, John of Salisbury, continued by Alan\r\nof Tewkesbury, William Fitz-Stephen, Herbert of Bosham, Edward Grim and\r\ntwo anonymous biographers, and also over eight hundred _Letters_\r\nconnected with the controversy. Some light is thrown on the contemporary\r\nestimate of Becket by the Latin metrical chronicle, _Draco Normannicus_,\r\nattributed to Etienne of Rouen and written before Becket’s martyrdom had\r\nconferred upon him exemption from criticism.\r\n\r\nWelsh affairs are recorded in the _Annales Cambriæ_ and the more\r\ndetailed _Brut y Tywysogion_, and much light is thrown upon them by the\r\n_Descriptio Cambriæ_ and the _Itinerarium Cambriæ_ of Gerald de Barri\r\n(“Giraldus Cambrensis”). The same writer’s _Topographia Hibernica_ gives\r\nan interesting but inaccurate account of Ireland, and his _Expugnatio\r\nHiberniæ_ recounts the conquest of Ireland by Richard “Strongbow,” Earl\r\nof Pembroke, and his companions. Another and more reliable account of\r\nthe conquest is given in the Norman poem, _The Song of Dermot and the\r\nEarl_ (ed. G. H. Orpen, 1891); it appears to have been based upon\r\nmaterials supplied by Morice Regan, secretary to King Dermot. In\r\naddition to these sources we have, for Irish history, the _Annals of the\r\nFour Masters_ and the _Annals of Loch Cé_.\r\n\r\nJordan Fantosme has left us a spirited Norman poem on the war between\r\nEngland and Scotland in 1173-4, including the capture of the Scottish\r\nking, at which he was present. Another poem, _Guillaume le Maréchal_\r\n(ed. P. Meyer, Société de l’Histoire de France), throws considerable\r\nlight upon Henry’s later years, as does the _De Principis Instructione_\r\nof Gerald de Barri and the _Vita Hugonis_, or Life of St. Hugh of\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\nOn the legal and constitutional side we have Glanville _De Legibus_, a\r\nformulary compiled by the justiciar about the end of Henry’s reign, and\r\nthe _Dialogus de Scaccario_ of Richard Fitz-Neal, an elaborate account,\r\nhistorical and technical, of the exchequer.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of illustrating the life of the times first place must be\r\naccorded to Gerald de Barri, who exhibits in a unique degree the\r\nqualifications of a journalist; clever, humorous, plucky, possessing\r\nimmense self-confidence, a fund of quotations, a love of “purple\r\npatches” and an eloquence of abuse worthy of his Welsh extraction, he\r\ncontinually enlivens his pages with personal anecdotes, usually\r\nscandalous. With him may be classed Walter Map, Archdeacon of Oxford,\r\nwitty and sarcastic. The _Maréchal_ poem, already mentioned, throws some\r\nlight on the life of the nobles, more especially of the younger landless\r\nmen, whose chief delight was in the tournament. The inner life of a\r\nmonastery is shown with singular fidelity in the _Chronicle_ of Jocelin\r\nof Brakelond, monk of Bury St. Edmunds, and a few details of the general\r\nlife of the people may be gleaned from the writings of Alexander\r\nNeckam.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN WRITERS\r\n\r\nThe reign of Henry II. has been treated by Lord Lyttleton, and more\r\nrecently by Miss Norgate and by Mrs. J. R. Green. The period is also\r\ncovered by the third volume of Sir J. Ramsay’s solid and scholarly\r\n_History of England_. Mr. Eyton in his _Household and Itinerary of Henry\r\nII._ endeavoured to trace the movements of the restless king from day to\r\nday and to assign to definite occasions his undated charters. Complete\r\nsuccess in such a task is not to be expected, but although there are a\r\nnumber of mistakes, especially in the dating of charters, the work is\r\nmonumental and most valuable to the student. Finally, mention may be\r\nmade of Mr. Round’s various papers in _Geoffrey de Mandeville_, _Feudal\r\nEngland_, and _The Commune of London_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nITINERARY OF HENRY II\r\n\r\n\r\nThis itinerary is based upon Eyton’s monumental work, the sources being,\r\nfirst, the definite statements of the chroniclers; secondly, the\r\nevidence of records, more particularly the Pipe Rolls, which prove the\r\npresence of the king at certain places in the course of the year but do\r\nnot as a rule give an exact date; and thirdly, royal charters, which can\r\nbe dated within certain limits by the names of the witnesses. Where the\r\nname of a place is given with a date in brackets, it indicates that the\r\nplace was visited during the year under which it appears, but that the\r\nexact date is problematic. In cases where charters given at a particular\r\nplace can be assigned with reasonable probability, but not with\r\ncertainty, to a particular year, the place name is put in brackets.\r\n\r\n1154\r\n\r\nDecember 7                 Barfleur\r\n\r\n   ”     8                 Coast of Hampshire\r\n                             (Henry lands)\r\n\r\n                           Winchester\r\n\r\n   ”    19                 Westminster\r\n                             (coronation)\r\n\r\n   ”    25                 Bermondsey\r\n\r\n\r\n1155\r\n\r\nJanuary 13                 Oxford\r\n\r\n[January,                  [Northampton]\r\nFebruary,                  York\r\nMarch]                     Scarborough\r\n                           [Lincoln]\r\n                           [Peterborough]\r\n                           [Thorney]\r\n                           [Ramsey]\r\n                           Nottingham\r\n\r\nMarch [c. 27]              London\r\n\r\nApril 10                   Wallingford\r\n\r\n[May, June]                Cleobury\r\n                           Wigmore\r\n                           Bridgnorth\r\n\r\nJuly 7                     Bridgnorth\r\n\r\n[July, August,             [Worcester]\r\nSeptember]                 [Salisbury]\r\n\r\nSeptember 20               Winchester\r\n\r\n[October,                  Cricklade\r\nNovember,                  Woodstock\r\nDecember]                  Windsor\r\n\r\nDecember 25                Westminster\r\n\r\n\r\n1156\r\n\r\nJanuary 2-10               Dover\r\n\r\n    ”  [11-31]             Wissant\r\n                           [St Omer]\r\n\r\nFebruary 2                 Rouen\r\n\r\n    ”    5                 near Gisors\r\n\r\n[February-August]          Anjou\r\n                           Mirebeau, in\r\n                             Poitou\r\n                           Chinon, in\r\n                             Touraine\r\n                           Loudun, in\r\n                             Touraine\r\n\r\n[September 1]              Saumur\r\n\r\n[October]                  Limoges\r\n\r\nDecember 25                Bordeaux\r\n\r\n\r\n1157\r\n\r\n[January-March]            Normandy\r\n\r\nApril [c. 8]               Barfleur\r\n                           Southampton\r\n                           London\r\n\r\n[May]                      Ongar\r\n\r\nMay 19                     Bury St.\r\n                             Edmunds\r\n\r\n ”  23-28                  Colchester\r\n\r\n[June]                     [Thetford]\r\n                           [Norwich]\r\n\r\nJuly 17                    Northampton\r\n\r\n[July]                     The Peak\r\n                           Chester\r\n\r\n[August]                   North Wales\r\n\r\nDecember 13                Gloucester\r\n\r\n    ”    25                Lincoln\r\n\r\n\r\n1158\r\n\r\n[January]                  Carlisle\r\n\r\n[February,                 [Blythe]\r\nMarch]                     [Nottingham]\r\n                           The Peak\r\n\r\nApril 20                   Worcester\r\n\r\n[April-August]             [Evesham]\r\n                           [Tewkesbury]\r\n                           Gloucester\r\n                           Wells\r\n                           Cheddar\r\n                           Brill\r\n                           Clarendon\r\n                           [Westminster]\r\n                           Brockenhurst\r\n                           Winchester\r\n\r\nAugust 14                  Portsmouth\r\n                           (Henry\r\n                             crosses to\r\n                             Normandy)\r\n\r\n[August]                   near Gisors\r\n\r\nSeptember 8                Argentan\r\n\r\n[September]                Paris\r\n\r\nSeptember 29               Avranches\r\n\r\nOctober [c. 9]             Nantes\r\n\r\n[October]                  Thouars\r\n\r\n[November]                 Le Mans\r\n\r\nNovember 23                Mont St.\r\n                             Michael\r\n\r\n[November,                 Avranches\r\nDecember]                  Bayeux\r\n                           Caen\r\n                           Rouen\r\n\r\nDecember 25                Cherbourg\r\n\r\n\r\n1159\r\n\r\n[?

He is undoubtedly right in pointing out that the chronicler\r\nconfused Henry’s unwarlike cousin, Earl William of Gloucester, with his\r\nloyal uncle, Earl Robert, making the latter refuse to give that help\r\nwhich, had he then been living, he would certainly have rendered to\r\nthe utmost of his ability. On the other hand, what we know of Henry’s\r\nvisit to England in 1149 is quite inconsistent with the wretched fiasco\r\ndescribed in the _Gesta_, and when Mr. Round argues that “the statement\r\nthat Henry applied for help to his mother by no means involves ...\r\nher presence in England at the time,” it is difficult to follow his\r\nargument. Had Henry applied for money to any one outside England it\r\nwould presumably have been to his father, and, moreover, in 1149 the\r\nempress could not have been in straitened circumstances.\r\n\r\n[3] See list of witnesses to charter executed at Devizes on 13th April,\r\n1149: _Sarum Charters_ (Rolls Ser.), 16.\r\n\r\n[4] The connection between Louis and Eleanor was very distant, but\r\na literal observance of the Canon Law would have invalidated the\r\nmarriages of half the nobility of Europe.\r\n\r\n[5] It is not quite certain when Richard de Luci was associated with\r\nthe Earl of Leicester in the justiciarship, but the earl was clearly\r\nChief Justiciar until his death in 1168, and may have held the superior\r\nposition by priority of appointment.\r\n\r\n[6] Nicholas Brakespere, the only Englishman to attain the papacy, was\r\nelected pope and took the title of Adrian IV. in December 1154.\r\n\r\n[7] Roger of Hoveden mentions in particular the Yorkshire castle of\r\nDrax as one of the last of many destroyed by Stephen.\r\n\r\n[8] After his description of Earl William’s great castle of\r\nScarborough, William de Neuburgh adds that when in course of time it\r\nfell into decay, King Henry rebuilt it. It is rather surprising to find\r\nhow soon this occurred, but the Pipe Roll for 1159 shows £111 spent\r\n“on the works of the castle of Scardeburc,” and £70 spent on the works\r\nof the “tower” (_turris_), a term which Mr. Round has shown to imply a\r\nkeep. Next year £94, 3s. 4d. was spent on the keep, and the following\r\nyear £107, 6s. 8d. on the castle.\r\n\r\n[10] The claim of the popes to the sovereignty over islands was based\r\nupon the forged “Donation” of Constantine.\r\n\r\n[11] This payment of 500 marks, entered under Essex on the lost Pipe\r\nRoll for the first year of Henry II., is copied into the _Red Book of\r\nthe Exchequer_.\r\n\r\n[12] There are numerous references to the “nova terra” of Earl Warenne\r\non the Pipe Roll 4 Henry II.\r\n\r\n[13] According to the _Brut y Tywysogion_ (p. 109), an English governor\r\non one occasion took certain action, “knowing the manners of the people\r\nof the country, that they would all be killing one another.”\r\n\r\n[14] Many of these were probably merely positions of advantage\r\nstrengthened with ditch and wooden stockade.\r\n\r\n[15] See Round, _Commune of London_, 281.\r\n\r\n[16] Details of these proceedings are to be found on the Pipe Rolls, 11\r\nand 12 Henry II.\r\n\r\n[17] In justice to Henry it must be remembered that the mutilation or\r\nexecution of hostages was the natural outcome of the rebellion of those\r\nfor whose good conduct they were sureties. A hostage who cannot be\r\npunished for the sins of those whom he represents is merely a useless\r\nexpense to his keeper.\r\n\r\n[18] The Pipe Roll, 12 Henry II., shows both these princes on good\r\nterms with the English.\r\n\r\n[19] The Pipe Roll for 8 Henry II. shows “60s. paid to William Cade for\r\ngold for the crown of the king’s son, and for preparing the regalia,”\r\nand the Roll for the twelfth year records the expenditure of 7s. “for\r\ncarrying the regalia of the king’s son into Normandy.” It would also\r\nseem (see below, p. 91) that the pope issued a commission for the\r\nArchbishop of York to crown the young prince.\r\n\r\n[20] Gervase of Canterbury (_Opera_, i. 171) says that Thomas\r\ninstituted the feast of the Holy Trinity. It would seem that the Sunday\r\nfollowing Whitsunday was already sacred to the Trinity, but that he\r\ngave to the feast a position which it had not held before in England,\r\nand which it did not attain on the Continent till a much later date.\r\n\r\n[21] The legend that the mother of Thomas was the daughter of a Saracen\r\nemir into whose hands Gilbert Becket had fallen during a pilgrimage to\r\nthe Holy Land, and that, after helping Gilbert to escape, she followed\r\nhim to London, is of late date and absolutely without foundation.\r\n\r\n[22] The actual salary of the chancellor was 5s. a day, but the\r\nperquisites of the office, including the gifts which those who required\r\nhis favour had to make, were great. Becket himself was said, by Foliot,\r\nto have paid “many thousand marks” for the office.\r\n\r\n[23] Translation from one see to another, except in the case of\r\npromotion to the primacy, was extremely rare, and almost unheard of, in\r\nEngland at this time.\r\n\r\n[24] A small point, not without significance as an indication of\r\ncharacter, is observable in the gradual degradation of the royal oath.\r\nThe Conqueror swore “by the splendour of God,” Henry “by the eyes of\r\nGod,” Richard “by the body” or “by the thighs of God,” and John “by the\r\nfeet,” or even “by the nails, of God.”\r\n\r\n[25] Isabelle de Warenne had been the wife of William, son of King\r\nStephen, the cousin of William of Anjou. The connection being through\r\nthe Empress Maud there was no obstacle to her marriage, afterwards\r\neffected, with Hamelin, the illegitimate son of Geoffrey of Anjou.\r\n\r\n[26] Their names occur as owing these sums “pro plegio archiepiscopi”\r\non the Pipe Roll, 11 Henry II.\r\n\r\n[27] The claim of the northern archbishops to have their cross carried\r\nbefore them within the province of Canterbury was a continual source of\r\ndispute for several centuries, leading to many undignified scenes.\r\n\r\n[28] See Pipe Roll, 16 Henry II.\r\n\r\n[29] See Pipe Roll, 12 Henry II.\r\n\r\n[30] For a discussion of the authenticity of this letter of Pope\r\nAdrian, see Round, _The Commune of London_, 171-200, and, on the other\r\nside, Orpen, _Ireland under the Normans_, i. 312-8.\r\n\r\n[31] This province had been previously offered to Herbert and William\r\nFitz-Herbert, half-brothers of Earl Reynold of Cornwall, and Jolland de\r\nla Pomeray, but they had wisely declined the gift.\r\n\r\n[32] The Pipe Roll, 19 Henry II., shows an expenditure of £32, 6s. 5d.\r\nfor the king’s maintenance at Northampton for four days; and it would\r\nseem that he travelled without luggage, as over £72 was spent at the\r\nsame time on the outfit which the sheriff provided for the king. None\r\nof the chroniclers notice this flying visit, but the evidence appears\r\nto favour the end of June as the most probable date.\r\n\r\n[33] All the authorities agree as to the rapidity of Henry’s dash to\r\nDol. Presumably he had with him only a small mounted escort.\r\n\r\n[34] The Pipe Roll of 21 Henry II. shows a pension of 33s. 4d. paid to\r\nher for the last quarter of the twentieth year. She seems to have died\r\nin 1188, as the pension was then paid to her son John.\r\n\r\n[35] “Fair Rosamund” was buried at Godstow Abbey, where the king set\r\nup a wonderfully carved monument to her memory. As we find fifty marks\r\npaid “for work at Godstow” in 1177, the first of a number of similar\r\npayments, it is probable that she had been buried there the previous\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[36] She was apparently still alive in 1181, when a small allowance\r\nwas made her, the sum of 66s. 8d. paid “matri G. cancellarii ad eam\r\nsustentandam” appearing amongst the charges on the bishopric of Lincoln.\r\n\r\n[37] It is interesting to observe that Matthew Paris assigns to the\r\nyoung king Henry a shield of arms,--per pale gules and sable, three\r\ngolden leopards; _Chron. Maj._ (Rolls Ser.), vi. 473. This bears every\r\nmark of being an exceptionally early instance of differencing, and\r\nmakes it more than probable that Henry II. bore the red shield with the\r\nthree golden leopards, which has ever since been the arms of England.\r\n\r\n[38] As for instance in the case of the disputed privileges of the\r\nabbey of St. Alban’s, when his examination of their charters and his\r\ncomments thereon showed remarkable painstaking ability: _Gesta Abbatum\r\nS. Albani_ (Rolls Ser.) i. 145-155. Another case, reported in still\r\ngreater detail, is the suit between the Bishop of Chichester and the\r\nAbbot of Battle: _Chron. of Battle Abbey_ (ed. Lower), 78-115. For\r\nan instance of the king’s appreciation of legal technicalities, see\r\n_ibid._, 182.\r\n\r\n[39] The Pipe Roll for 31 Henry II. records a fine of 500 marks imposed\r\non the Bishop of Durham for holding a plea touching the advowson of a\r\nchurch in Court Christian.\r\n\r\n[40] An instance of a difficult case being referred by the justiciar to\r\nKing Henry occurs in the _Chron. Mon. de Abingdon_ (Rolls Ser.), ii.\r\n229.\r\n\r\n[41] Instances of the blessing of the ordeal pits occur in the Pipe\r\nRolls. In 1166, for instance, 10s. was paid to two priests for blessing\r\nthe pits (_fossarum_) at Bury St. Edmunds, and in Wiltshire 5s. was\r\npaid for preparing the pools (_polis_) for the ordeal of thieves, and\r\n20s. to priests for blessing the same pools. As early as 1158 the\r\nsheriff of Wiltshire accounted for making “the pools of the moneyers,”\r\nand in 1175 in Hampshire there were payments made for “blessing the\r\nordeal pits (_fossis iuisse_), and the cost of doing justice on the\r\npeasants who burnt their lord.”\r\n\r\n[42] _Engl. Hist. Rev._, xxv. 709.\r\n\r\n[43] The fragmentary return to the Inquest of Sheriffs made from the\r\nEarl of Arundel’s lands in Norfolk has been printed as an appendix to\r\nthe _Red Book of the Exchequer_ in the Rolls Series, but was first\r\nidentified by Mr. Round.\r\n\r\n[44] See Round, _Commune of London_, 229-233.\r\n\r\n[45] In connection with the “sheriff’s aid” there is an interesting\r\nentry in the _Chronicle of Abingdon_ (ii. 230), which relates that\r\na former abbot had granted the sheriff 100s. yearly to protect the\r\ninterests of the abbey’s tenants. The later sheriffs had continued to\r\ndraw the money while doing nothing for it, and Abbot Ingulf refused to\r\ncontinue the payment, lest it should become established as a custom.\r\nThe matter was brought before King Henry, who gave his decision in the\r\nabbot’s favour. The survey of the manors belonging to the canons of\r\nSt. Paul’s in 1181 shows that the payments due to the sheriff from the\r\ndifferent manors varied from 6d. to 4s. on the hide.\r\n\r\n[46] The numerous references to Jews on the Pipe Rolls and in\r\ncontemporary chronicles have been brought together in Jacobs’ _The Jews\r\nof Angevin England_. Examples of their dealings with monastic houses\r\nmay be found in Jocelin of Brakelond’s _Chronicle_, relating to St.\r\nEdmund’s Abbey, and in the _Gesta Abbatum_ concerning St. Alban’s,\r\nwhile an idea of their importance to the litigant in want of ready\r\nmoney for legal expenses may be gathered from Richard of Anstey’s\r\nfamous story of the costs of his lawsuit (translated in Hall’s _Court\r\nLife of the Plantagenets_), in which he accounts for some seventeen\r\ndifferent loans, amounting in all to £87, on which he paid £53 for\r\nusury.\r\n\r\n[47] The tally, the precursor of the counterfoil, was a wooden stick\r\non the edge of which the sum paid was indicated by a series of cuts\r\nor notches, the various sizes of which indicated definite sums. The\r\nstick being split parallel to its face, each party to the payment\r\nretained one portion, with its edge thus significantly notched, and the\r\ngenuineness of either portion could at once be proved by putting the\r\ntwo together, when the notches would be found to tally.",
