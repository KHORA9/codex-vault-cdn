The Court passed a resolution affirming that the evidence\r\ngiven before the committee had tended to prove that the financial affairs\r\nof the county had been conducted by the Court of Quarter Sessions with\r\nproper attention to economy, with just regard to the public interests,\r\nand with the publicity required by law.\r\n\r\n18.*--\"A few days since the steeple of Drayton church fell to the ground\r\nwith a tremendous crash, the lead which covered the falling mass being\r\ncompletely buried in the _debris_.\"\r\n\r\n20.--A prolonged magisterial inquiry took place at Reepham, into\r\ndisturbances at Lenwade arising out of the Wesleyan schism.  Two parish\r\nconstables, Samuel Fairman and John Elliott, were fined for refusing to\r\nperform their duty when requested by the Rev. C. Povah.  At Aylsham Petty\r\nSessions, on February 4th, four persons were charged with disturbing the\r\nWesleyan congregation at Cawston on January 19th, and three were\r\ncommitted for trial at the Quarter Sessions.  One of the defendants,\r\nElizabeth Southgate, was ordered by the Court, on March 13th, to pay a\r\npenalty of 40 pounds; the other two were discharged on their own\r\nrecognisances to appear at the next Quarter Sessions.  A singular case\r\narising from the same disruption came before the Vice-Chancellor, Lord\r\nCranworth, on May 7th.  The relators and plaintiffs were the Rev. William\r\nWorker and the Rev. George Badcock, and the defendants the trustees of\r\ntwo deeds dated 1814 and 1837, declaring the trusts of the Methodist\r\nchapel at Holt subject to the trusts of a deed executed in 1784 by John\r\nWesley, by which the Wesleyan body was organized.  The funds for building\r\nthe chapel were advanced in 1814 by Mr. Hardy, who, in 1821, received\r\nfrom the trustees a mortgage of the chapel to secure his advances, which\r\namounted to about 700 pounds.  In 1833 the debt was reduced to 350\r\npounds.  The congregation having increased, it was determined, in 1837,\r\nto build a new chapel, and a site was purchased and conveyed to the\r\ntrustees upon the trusts of a deed of another chapel, prepared in 1832,\r\nand known to the Methodist body as the \"model deed,\" to which all\r\nsubsequent deeds were conformable.  By the trusts then declared, such\r\npersons only were to be permitted to preach as should be duly approved by\r\na Methodist body called the Conference.  Mr. Hardy assisted in advancing\r\nmoney to build the new chapel, and received as security a mortgage on the\r\nchapel.  When the schism occurred it was alleged that the majority of the\r\ntrustees of the chapels mortgaged were among the schismatics, who now\r\ncalled themselves Wesleyan Reformers, and that they had all formed a\r\nscheme of wresting the chapels from the preachers appointed by the\r\nConference.  The defendant united with the character of mortgagee those\r\nof acting trustee and treasurer of the two chapels, and it was alleged\r\nthat he was using his powers as mortgagee, and had publicly recommended\r\nothers to do the same--most of the Wesleyan chapels being mortgaged--for\r\nthe purpose of carrying the general scheme into effect, and thus to\r\ndeprive the Conference of the old body of Methodists of the use of their\r\nchapels.  Mr. Hardy accordingly advertised the chapels for sale, and\r\nactually sold the old chapel, which was then in possession of the\r\nReformers for their preachers.  Similar proceedings by ejectment were\r\nresorted to by a person named Hill, to whom Mr. Hardy had transferred his\r\nsecond mortgage, for the recovery of the new chapel, and led to the\r\nfiling of this information, which disputed the propriety of the\r\ntransactions.  His lordship was of opinion that Mr. Hardy, as mortgagee,\r\nhad a right to assert a title adverse to the trust, and to transfer his\r\nmortgage to Hill.  It might be proper to appoint new trustees in the\r\nplace of those who had ceased to have any sympathy with the religious\r\nbody from which they had seceded, but there was no ground for immediate\r\ninterference.  The motion was therefore refused, and there was no order\r\nas to costs.\r\n\r\n20.--A great Protestant meeting was held at the Assembly Rooms, Norwich,\r\nunder the presidency of Mr. Samuel Bignold, at which were adopted\r\naddresses to the Queen and the Archbishop of Canterbury, protesting\r\nagainst the aggression of the Pope, and condemning the Tractarian\r\nmovement in the Church of England.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--Douglas's Theatrical Company, which performed in several of the towns\r\npreviously visited by the Norfolk and Suffolk Company of Comedians for so\r\nmany years under the management of the Fishers, concluded a successful\r\nseason at East Dereham.  \"Those who have witnessed the performances have\r\nbeen agreeably surprised at finding so great an amount of talent in an\r\nitinerant company.\"\r\n\r\n3.--Died at Lynn, Mr. James Smith, many years manager of the Theatre\r\nRoyal, Norwich.  He was in his 74th year.\r\n\r\n11.--A performance of \"Speed the Plough\" was given at the Theatre Royal,\r\nNorwich, for the benefit of Mr. George Bennett, the \"Father of the\r\nNorwich Stage,\" and \"a member of the company in the palmy days of the\r\ndrama in the city.\"  Mr. Bennett appeared in the character of Farmer\r\nAshfield.  \"The Mayor gave his patronage, and in every part of the dress\r\ncircle were to be recognised parties of high respectability, including\r\nthe old familiar faces of those who, thirty or forty years ago, were wont\r\nto uphold and maintain the then palmy but now very depressed cause of\r\nlegitimate drama.\"  The night's receipts amounted to upwards of 90\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n--The Norwich Town Council resolved to petition the House of Commons for\r\nthe total repeal of the Window-tax.\r\n\r\n18.--Mr. Peter Master Yarington was presented with a silver salver and a\r\npurse of 283 sovs., in recognition of his efficient discharge of duty as\r\nSuperintendent of the Norwich Police.  He was appointed Governor of the\r\nCity Gaol on July 31st, and was succeeded as head of the police force by\r\nMr. Dunne, formerly of the Kent constabulary.  Mr. Yarington died, in his\r\n41st year, on July 21st, 1852, and on October 19th of that year Mr.\r\nRobert Campling was appointed Governor of the gaol.\r\n\r\n19.--Mr. Albert Smith gave his \"new literary, pictorial, and musical\r\nentertainment,\" entitled, \"The Overland Mail,\" at the Assembly Rooms,\r\nNorwich.\r\n\r\n22.--A serious riot occurred at Yarmouth.  Samuel Graystone, mate of the\r\nAnt, from Yarmouth to Plymouth, had signed articles to go the voyage, but\r\nwas forcibly prevented by seamen from boarding his ship.  Masters of\r\nother vessels complained to the magistrates that they had been subjected\r\nto similar treatment.  The staff of the East Norfolk Militia and the\r\nCoastguard were called out to keep the riotous seamen in check, and two\r\ntroops of the 11th Hussars were conveyed by special trains from Norwich\r\nto assist in quelling the disturbance.  The cavalry rode through the\r\ntown, and quickly cleared the streets.  \"The rioters, frightened by the\r\nmere appearance of the troops, flew in every direction up the narrow rows\r\nof the town, and in a few hours tranquillity was restored.\"  It was\r\nstated that, but for the timely arrival of the troops, a body of\r\nGorleston seamen would have made an attack upon the town.  Several of the\r\nrioters were tried at the Quarter Sessions on March 6th, when, to the\r\nsurprise of the Court, a verdict of not guilty was returned.\r\n\r\n26.--Died at his family seat, Kirby Hall, the Hon. and Rev. Lord Berners.\r\n\"He succeeded to the title and estates on the death of his brother\r\nRobert, Lord Berners, better known in the sporting world as Col. Wilson.\r\nHe only attended at the House of Lords on a few occasions, one of which\r\nwas to vote for the Reform Bill; but though absent in person, his proxy\r\nwas always given to the support of the Whigs, of which, through life, he\r\nwas a firm and constant supporter.\"\r\n\r\n--An exhibition of hawking was given on Hellesdon Brakes, near Norwich,\r\nby Mr. Barr, the celebrated Scottish falconer.  Many hundreds of persons\r\nwere present.  Mr. Barr used four young hawks of the peregrine species.\r\nThey were flown at pigeons which were let loose, and in two hours two\r\ndozen were brought to the ground.  \"The first two or three were so\r\nfrightened, that when pursued by the hawk they took refuge among the\r\npeople, and one of them alighted on the back of a horse, and was taken by\r\nhand.\"  Mr. Barr gave a second exhibition on March 10th, on Mr. George\r\nGowing's land at Trowse.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.--A fire occurred at the office of the \"Norwich Mercury,\" Castle\r\nStreet, Norwich.  The roof of the building fell in, and the compositors'\r\nroom, with most of the cases of type, was destroyed.\r\n\r\n13.--Dr. White, the eminent translator of \"D'Aubigne's History,\"\r\ndelivered, in the old Council Chamber at the Guildhall, Norwich, a\r\nlecture on \"The Causes and Consequences of the Reformation.\"\r\n\r\n27.--At the Norfolk Assizes, before Lord Chief Justice Jervis, the libel\r\naction, Abbott _v._ Bacon and Another, was tried.  The defendants\r\npublished a statement in the \"Norwich Mercury,\" to the effect that the\r\nplaintiff, a superintendent of the County Constabulary at East Dereham,\r\nhad stolen certain articles from the shop of Mr. Abram, a chemist and\r\ndruggist in that town.  The jury assessed the damages at one farthing.\r\nOn April 16th a motion was made in the Court of Exchequer for a new\r\ntrial, on the ground of misdirection of the jury, and a rule _nisi_ was\r\ngranted.  At a meeting held at the Norfolk Hotel, on April 5th, it was\r\nresolved, \"That the recent trial offered a most painful illustration of\r\nthe gross injustice which may be inflicted upon the editor of a newspaper\r\nwho honestly and fearlessly comments on matters of general interest,\" and\r\na public subscription was opened to recoup the proprietors of the\r\n\"Mercury\" the loss they had sustained by their successful vindication of\r\nthe liberty of the Press.  In the Court of Exchequer, on June 27th, both\r\nsides agreed to a verdict being entered for one farthing damages.\r\n\r\n28.--George Baldry (33) was found guilty, at the Norfolk Assizes, before\r\nMr. Justice Erle, of murdering Caroline Warnes, at Thurlton, by striking\r\nher on the head with a hammer.  The sentence of death was commuted to\r\ntransportation for life.\r\n\r\n29.--At the Norwich Assizes, before Mr. Justice Erle, John Whitley Cooper\r\nand Edmund Slingsby Drury Long, solicitors, and Frederick Goose, dealer,\r\nwere indicted for unlawfully conspiring to obtain, by false pretences,\r\nfrom Sarah Roberts Tooke, widow, divers goods, furniture, and effects,\r\nwith intent to defraud.  Cooper was at the time undergoing sentence of\r\ntwelve months' imprisonment, passed upon him at Norwich Quarter Sessions\r\non December 31st, 1850, for fraud.  He was now sentenced to two years'\r\nimprisonment in the Common Gaol; Long was acquitted, and Goose, who had\r\nabsconded, forfeited his recognisances.  The victim of this conspiracy,\r\nsaid the Judge, had been reduced from a position of respectability to one\r\nof absolute ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n12.--Mr. Fred Phillips, while performing the part of Rob Roy at Norwich\r\nTheatre, fell from a \"fictitious precipice\" and sustained a compound\r\nfracture of the bones of the leg \"implicating the ankle joint.\"  He was\r\nremoved to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, and \"upon a consultation\r\namong the surgeons it was deemed necessary to amputate the lower\r\nextremity of the bone, an operation which was borne with heroic fortitude\r\nby the poor sufferer.\"  A performance was given at the Theatre on May 6th\r\nfor the benefit of Mr. Phillips, when Mr. George Bennett made his last\r\nappearance on the stage, in the part of Farmer Ashfield, and Mrs.\r\nPhillips sustained the character of Miss Blandford in \"The Ladies' Club.\"\r\nMr. Phillips received a second benefit on April 20th, 1852, and on July\r\n9th, 1853, announced that he had taken the Boar's Head Inn, Surrey\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n23.--The headquarters of the 11th Hussars, commanded by the Earl of\r\nCardigan, marched from Norwich Barracks for Nottingham, and were\r\nsucceeded on the 25th by the 2nd Dragoon Guard's (Queen's Bays).\r\n\r\n--Samuel Woodhouse, of Plumstead, and William Pyle, of Holt, were buried\r\nalive in a well 115 feet deep, at Docking, by the falling in of 36 feet\r\nof soil.  \"Some of the inhabitants proposed to fill up the well and let\r\nthem remain in it, stating that the same thing had been done at\r\nTittleshall, where an inquest was held at the mouth of the well and the\r\nbody or bodies remain there to this day.\"  Efforts were made, however, to\r\nrecover the bodies.  That of Pyle was found on May 14th, and of Woodhouse\r\non the 15th.  \"Though the bodies had been buried exactly three weeks, on\r\ntheir being brought to the surface and moved about blood flowed freely\r\nfrom both of them.\"\r\n\r\n30.--Died, aged 78, Mr. Richard Slann, of Southtown, Great Yarmouth,\r\nhistorical engraver to her Majesty the Queen.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--The Census returns for the city of Norwich were published.

He was educated at Eton, and was afterwards a Fellow of\r\nKing's College, Cambridge.  Ordained deacon and priest by Bishop Horsley,\r\nhe officiated at St. James's, Westminster, and went out to St. Petersburg\r\nas chaplain to the Embassy.  Subsequently he either threw off his gown or\r\nhad it taken from him, and became a blacksmith and coach-spring maker in\r\nNorfolk Street, Lynn.  He was apprehended, tried, and transported for\r\nstealing iron, the property of Mr. Bottomley, of South Gates, in that\r\ntown.  At the expiration of his term of transportation he returned to\r\nLynn, made a settlement in the town, and was for several years an inmate\r\nof the Workhouse.  He died at the advanced age of 78 years.\r\n\r\n12.--Died, at the age of 63, at his residence, the Close, Norwich, Mr.\r\nWilliam Ollett, \"who obtained justly-deserved eminence as a carver of\r\nwood for ecclesiastical purposes, and whose skill was called into\r\nrequisition in most of the cathedrals of this kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--The \"members of Reffley\" celebrated the 62nd anniversary of the\r\nbuilding of their temple, \"the society having existed before the memory\r\nof the oldest inhabitant\" (of Lynn).\r\n\r\n21.--The hand of a female was found in Miss Martineau's plantation,\r\nMartineau's Lane, Norwich, by a lad named Charles Johnson.

He was born in India, came to this country as a\r\nboy, and was educated at Norwich Grammar School and Christ Church,\r\nOxford.  He was subsequently called to the Bar, was for a time Clerk of\r\nthe House of Commons, and succeeded his uncle, Mr. Hardinge Stracey, as\r\ncounsel to the Chairmen of Committees of the House of Lords on Mr. Pitt's\r\nappointment to office.  For several years he was Chairman of Quarter\r\nSessions for Cheshire, and a magistrate for that county as well as for\r\nNorfolk and Suffolk.\r\n\r\n26.--At the Norfolk Assizes, before Lord Chief Baron Pollock and a\r\nspecial jury, was tried the action, Baldry _v._ Ellis.  This was an issue\r\ndirected to be tried by the late Master of the Rolls, and involved the\r\ndisposal of a sum of about 25,000 pounds.  The jury had to decide whether\r\none Bailey Bird, deceased, who contracted marriage in the year 1818, was\r\ncompetent to make that contract.  A large number of witnesses deposed\r\nthat Bird was of perfectly sound mind at the time of his marriage; an\r\nequally large number, including several medical men, asserted that he was\r\nan idiot.  The jury were of opinion that Bird was not of sound mind at\r\nthe time of the celebration of his marriage, and returned a verdict for\r\nthe defendant.\r\n\r\n28.--Henry Groom (42) was indicted at the Norfolk Assizes, before Mr.\r\nJustice Cresswell, for the murder of John Ayton, by shooting him with a\r\npistol, at Burnham Thorpe, on July 4th.

He died a few days before, at Cincinnati.\"\r\n\r\n16.--On this date was published an extract from the \"New York Express,\"\r\ngiving particulars of a confession of murder by a private named Thomson,\r\nbelonging to the 1st Royals, then stationed at Halifax, North America.\r\nHe stated that when at Norwich eight years previously he was on terms of\r\nintimacy with a woman.  A quarrel had occurred between them, and he had\r\nthrown her into a canal.  The crime had so preyed upon his mind that he\r\ndetermined to give himself up to justice and allow the law to take its\r\ncourse.  On September 13th it was announced that Thomson had been brought\r\nto England and committed to Winchester Gaol, pending inquiries by the\r\npolice of that city.  Two police-officers came to Norwich, investigated\r\nthe affair, and elicited the following remarkable facts: Thomson was\r\nstationed in Norwich with the Carabineers in 1846, and afterwards\r\nexchanged to the 1st Royals, then in Canada.  A girl named Anna Barber\r\nwas in the habit of frequenting the barracks, and became acquainted with\r\nThomson, whom she appeared to have displeased.  In the month of August,\r\n1846, a tailor named James Taylor was fishing for eels in the river near\r\nBlackfriars Bridge when he heard a scuffle, a shriek, a splash, and the\r\nsound of retreating footsteps.  He immediately rowed to the place and\r\nassisted out of the water a young woman, who refused to give him her\r\nname.  She went away, and no report was made to the police.  In 1850 Anna\r\nBarber was again seen in Norwich.  It was evident, therefore, that the\r\nremorse which impelled Thomson to make his confession was groundless.\r\n\r\n28.--The Norwich Corporation adopted the Public Health Act of 1848, and\r\nappointed twenty members as a Local Board of Health.\r\n\r\n29.--The church of St. Matthew, Thorpe Hamlet, was consecrated by the\r\nBishop of Norwich.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n10.--Sir James Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak, then on a visit to England,\r\nattended a dinner given at the Norfolk Hotel, Norwich, by members of the\r\nValpeian Club, established in 1847.\r\n\r\n25.--A severe gale occurred off the Norfolk coast, and did much damage to\r\nshipping at Yarmouth.\r\n\r\n30.--The opening of the Norwich Waterworks was publicly celebrated.  The\r\nband of the Coldstream Guards played selections in the Market Place, 220\r\nguests dined at the Assembly Rooms, under the presidency of Mr. Samuel\r\nBignold, chairman of the Waterworks Company, and twenty thousand persons\r\nwitnessed a display of fireworks in the Market Place.  The works were\r\ncommenced by Messrs. Lucas Bros., the contractors, in February.

He inherited a baronetcy as Sir George\r\nJerningham on his father's death in 1809, and established his title to\r\nthe barony, under letters patent of Charles I., through his great\r\ngrandmother, after a reversal of the attainder of Sir William Howard,\r\nViscount Stafford, in 1824.  He assumed the additional name of Stafford\r\nin 1826.  He was succeeded by his eldest son, Henry Valentine.\r\n\r\n7.--Mr. George Cruikshank presided at the annual temperance festival held\r\nat St. Andrew's Hall, Norwich, and delivered an address.\r\n\r\n16.--Bexfield's oratorio, \"Israel Restored,\" was \"brought out\" at the\r\nChoral Concert, held at St. Andrew's Hall, Norwich.  The principal\r\nvocalists were Miss Birch, Miss Williams, Mr. Benson, and Mr. H.\r\nPhillips.

He had seen much active service,\r\nand had been employed on the North-West coast of America.\r\n\r\n9.--For the office of Mayor of Norwich two candidates were nominated--Mr.\r\nSamuel Bignold and Mr. Richard Coaks.  The voting was equal, and the\r\nMayor giving his casting-vote in favour of the latter, Mr. Coaks was\r\ndeclared duly elected.  Mr. George Womack was appointed Sheriff.  (_See_\r\nNovember 23rd.)\r\n\r\n22.--Election petitions were laid upon the table of the House of Commons,\r\nagainst the return of Messrs. Peto and Warner, as members for Norwich.\r\n(_See_ February 24th, 1853.)\r\n\r\n23.--In the Court of Queen's Bench a rule in the nature of a _quo\r\nwarranto_ was applied for, calling upon Mr. Coaks, Mayor of Norwich, to\r\nshow by what authority he exercised that office.  The affidavits stated\r\nthat on November 9th there were two candidates for the Mayoralty, Mr.\r\nBignold and Mr. Coaks, and that the retiring Mayor refused to record the\r\nvote of Mr. Cundall in favour of Mr. Bignold.  Consequently the voting\r\nwas even, and the retiring Mayor gave his casting-vote in favour of Mr.\r\nCoaks.  The affidavits further stated, in support of Mr. Cundall's right\r\nto vote, that at the election of councillors on November 1st, 1851, Mr.\r\nCundall was a candidate in opposition to Mr. Robert Wiffin Blake, then\r\none of the aldermen of Norwich, and therefore ineligible to be elected a\r\ncouncillor; and that Mr. Cundall had, prior to the election, given notice\r\nof Mr. Blake's disqualification, but that Mr. Blake was elected by a\r\nmajority of five votes.  Subsequently, on a _quo warranto_ being filed\r\nagainst him, judgment of ouster was obtained.  Mr. Cundall therefore made\r\nthe required declaration before two councillors, and took his seat as a\r\ncouncillor at the late election of Mayor, and claimed to have his vote\r\nrecorded for Mr. Bignold, which, if received, would have placed him in a\r\nmajority of one over Mr. Coaks; but such vote was rejected by the\r\nretiring Mayor.  The Court granted the rule.  The Attorney-General showed\r\ncause against the rule on January 28th, 1853.  The Court was of opinion\r\nthat Mr. Cundall had made out a clear _prima facie_ case, and the rule\r\nfor the _quo warranto_ was made absolute.  Lord Campbell gave judgment in\r\nthe case on January 21st, 1854.  He said it entirely depended on the\r\nright of Cundall to vote.  He held that on November 9th, 1852, Cundall\r\nwas a member of the Council, and had a right to vote for Mr. Bignold, and\r\nif he had so voted Mr. Bignold would have been duly elected Mayor.  Mr.\r\nCoaks had usurped that office, and the _quo warranto_ had been properly\r\nissued.  Mr. Justice Crompton was of the same opinion.

Throughout the valley of the\r\nYare, a large extent of land has been for some time under water, on\r\neither side of the river, for a distance of thirty miles.\"  At Southery\r\nand Feltwell about 8,000 acres were flooded, and upwards of one hundred\r\npoor families were compelled to leave their habitations.  The estimated\r\nloss to the district was between 25,000 pounds and 30,000 pounds, and a\r\npublic subscription was opened for the relief of the sufferers.\r\n\r\n21.--The Public Library and Museums Act Committee reported to the Norwich\r\nTown Council that it was desirable to hire the Museum for the use of the\r\npublic for two days in the week, and to erect a building for the purposes\r\nof a free library, and that, in compliance with the Act, a rate of one\r\nhalfpenny in the pound be levied, one-third to be devoted to the former\r\nobject, and two-thirds to the latter.

Gompertz's panorama of the invasion of British India by the Sikh\r\nArmy of the Punjaub was exhibited at the Assembly Rooms, Norwich.  One of\r\nthe scenic attractions was a representation of \"the crypt of the Holy\r\nSepulchre, under three distinct aspects,\" a dioramic illusion which forms\r\na popular feature in similar entertainments at the present day.\r\n\r\n13.--A miraculous escape was recorded at Swaffham.  A drunken man named\r\nEdward Horsepool went into the yard of the Angel public-house, at three\r\no'clock in the morning, with the intention of lying down in a shed.  By\r\nmistake he opened the door of the covering of a disused well, and\r\nstepping in, fell to the bottom, a depth of 117 feet.  A tramp sleeping\r\nin the shed was awakened by the man's cries, and gave an alarm.  Mr.\r\nWilliam Laxon, collar maker, procured ropes, and Horsepool was rescued\r\nuninjured, after having been half an hour in 20 feet of water.  He had\r\nkept his head above the surface by clinging to the broken sides of the\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n22.--In the Prerogative Court, before Sir J. Dodson, was tried the action\r\nGilbert (administratrix of Woolner) _v._ Hammond.  It had reference to\r\ngranting administration, with will annexed, to the goods of Miss Margaret\r\nCreak, of Norwich, who died on June 5th, 1850, possessed of personal\r\nproperty of about 30,000 pounds and realty of the estimated value of 500\r\npounds per annum.  The will bore date January 13th, 1844, and its effect\r\nwas to leave, with some trifling exceptions, the personal property to Mr.\r\nWoolner, a chemist and druggist, who was also appointed executor.  The\r\nwill was originally propounded by Woolner, who afterwards committed\r\nsuicide, and his sister, Mrs. Gilbert, now applied for probate, as his\r\nadministratrix, which was, in the first instance, opposed by Mrs.\r\nHammond, a cousin-german and one of the next-of-kin of the deceased, but\r\nshe died during the pendency of the suit, and her husband subsequently\r\ntook up the case.  When the disposition of the property became known, a\r\ngreat many rumours were put in circulation, imputing foul play to Mr.\r\nWoolner, which was the cause of his committing suicide.  Judgment was\r\npronounced, on Feb. 4th, in favour of the will.  The Judge said the\r\nrelatives had a right to inquire into the transaction, and had they\r\nconfined themselves within due limits would have been entitled to costs\r\nout of the estate; but they had persisted down to the close of the\r\nargument in charges which they had failed to prove, and, therefore, in\r\ndecreeing probate of the will to Mrs. Gilbert, he must accompany it with\r\nthe condemnation of Mr. Hammond in 100 pounds costs, _nomine expensarum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n17.--Mr. C. J. Palmer, at a meeting of the Yarmouth Town Council, called\r\nattention to the unsatisfactory condition of the Corporation records, and\r\nstated that many of the documents in existence in Manship's time no\r\nlonger existed, whilst several others belonging to the town were in the\r\nhands of private individuals in Norwich.

The mails were delayed,\r\nand great inconvenience occasioned.  The morning train from London was\r\ndetained for fourteen hours at Lakenheath.  At Lynn, on the 23rd, the\r\ntide rose to a great height, and the low-lying parts of the town were\r\nunder water.  A breach occurred in the river bank near Magdalene, and\r\noccasioned the loss of much live stock and farm property.\r\n\r\n21.--Died at Leeds, aged 69, the Rev. Robert Fountaine Elwin, rector of\r\nWilby-with-Hargham.  He was well known in Norwich for the active part he\r\nhad taken in the Musical Festivals from their commencement.  A few years\r\nbefore his death he retired to Leeds, where he resided with his only\r\ndaughter, Mrs. Hyde.  Mr. Elwin not only possessed fine musical taste,\r\nbut was skilled in mechanics, and an excellent connoisseur of the fine\r\narts.  \"Whether in the company of the great, presiding at the Choral\r\nSociety's meetings, or lecturing to mechanics, it was always delightful\r\nand instructive to listen to him.\"  Mr. Elwin's paternal grandfather\r\nmarried a granddaughter of Oliver Cromwell.\r\n\r\n24.--In the House of Commons, Capt. Baldero presented a petition from\r\ncertain electors at Norwich, who had petitioned the House against the\r\nreturn of the sitting members, complaining that their petition had been\r\nwithdrawn without their consent, and praying that the order discharging\r\nthe petition might again be put on the orders of the House.  Mr. T.\r\nDuncombe presented a protest from Col. Dickson, complaining of the\r\nwithdrawal of the petition.  It was alleged that Mr. Brown, the\r\nParliamentary agent, had been guilty of a breach of privilege by\r\nwithdrawing the petition.  A motion for printing the petition was agreed\r\nto.  On March 2nd a Select Committee was appointed to inquire into the\r\nmatter.  The investigation commenced on March 10th, and concluded on\r\nMarch 17th, on which day Mr. Duncombe brought up the report of the\r\nCommittee.  They were of opinion that Mr. Brown had received no\r\ninstructions to withdraw the petition, but as they could find no\r\nprecedent as to the proper mode of proceeding under the circumstances,\r\nthey left it to the House to determine whether it could comply with the\r\nprayer of the petitioner.  On March 12th a great Liberal meeting was held\r\nat St. Andrew's Hall, Norwich, under the presidency of the Mayor (Mr.\r\nCoaks), at which resolutions were adopted expressing indignation at the\r\nallegations made before the Select Committee with regard to Messrs. Peto\r\nand Warner.  A duel was to have been fought between Col. Dickson and Col.\r\nForester (a witness before the Committee) on March 19th, but \"at the\r\neleventh hour the matter was fortunately adjusted by the friendly\r\ninterposition of an hon. member who sits on the opposite side of the\r\nHouse.  Mr. Culpepper represented Col. Dickson, and Mr. Craven Berkeley,\r\nM.P., was the friend of Col. Forester.\"  It subsequently transpired that\r\nthe withdrawal of the petition formed part of an arrangement and\r\ncompromise entered into between Mr. Henry Edward Brown and Mr. James\r\nCoppock, solicitor, in pursuance of which eight petitions were\r\nsimultaneously withdrawn, as implicating the seats of ten members of the\r\nHouse, namely, Norwich, 2; Kidderminster, 1; Gloucester, 1; Middlesex, 1;\r\nYoughal, 1; County Down, 2; and West Norfolk, 2.\r\n\r\n24.--At Norwich Quarter Sessions, before the Recorder, Mr. Prendergast,\r\nthe appeal case, Colman _v._ Clarke, was heard.  Mr. Evans and Mr. Palmer\r\nwere for the appellants, and Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Bulwer for the\r\nrespondent.  It was proved that in the early part of May, 1852, Messrs.\r\nColman established at Carrow a business for the manufacture of cake from\r\nrefuse rice, and it was alleged that after the process had been carried\r\non for a short time offensive smells were observed in the neighbourhood.\r\nThe firm were summoned before the magistrates for permitting a nuisance,\r\nand were fined.  They now appealed against the conviction, on the ground\r\nof informalities in the original proceedings, and of want of jurisdiction\r\non the part of the magistrates.  The conviction was quashed.\r\n\r\n28.--Hengler's Circus and Roman Amphitheatre, Castle Meadow, Norwich, was\r\nopened with the production of a grand equestrian spectacle, entitled,\r\n\"Kenilworth Castle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.--Died at his residence, Great Stanhope Street, London, in his 78th\r\nyear, General Sir Edward Kerrison, Bart., K.C.B., G.C.H.

The rooms were quickly cleared\r\nof the paintings and furniture, which were safely deposited in the school\r\nhouse.  There being no possibility of saving the south and west sides,\r\ngreat efforts were made to preserve the north and east sides, with which\r\nobject the communicating portions of the building were broken down, and\r\nthe flames thus prevented from extending.  In a few hours the roof of the\r\nwest side fell in.  \"The bed in which it is generally believed Queen\r\nElizabeth slept was not injured in the slightest degree.\"  The damage to\r\nthe hall was estimated at 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n7.--Intelligence was received at Norwich of the birth of a Prince (Prince\r\nLeopold), at Buckingham Palace.  Flags were hoisted on the public\r\nbuildings, and peals rung upon the bells of St. Peter Mancroft.\r\n\r\n19.--The men enrolled to serve in the First or West Norfolk Regiment of\r\nMilitia assembled at Norwich for twenty-eight days' training.

The mess was at the Swan Hotel.\r\n\"The corps consists of 612 men, and notwithstanding the vulgar sneers,\r\nreproaches, ridicule, and even hooting which they experienced from the\r\nrabble on their first appearance in the streets, in no instance was this\r\nconduct resented.  We are glad that the conduct of our Liberals, by\r\npublicly parading disgusting flags, and the Peace Society in circulating\r\nexciting and seditious handbills, with the view to holding up this force\r\nto contempt and ridicule, has signally failed.\"  The East Norfolk Militia\r\nassembled at Yarmouth on the same date.  \"Their appearance was much more\r\nrespectable than might have been expected, and many of those who were\r\nprepared to ridicule them acknowledged that they were a much better class\r\nthan they expected.\"  The officers were: Col. the Hon. Berkeley\r\nWodehouse; Lieut.-Col. William Mason; Major Sir E. K. Lacon; Captains\r\nJohn Longe, the Hon.

He was likewise known as an\r\nactive peace officer.  Previous to the establishment of the police force,\r\nthe whole business of thief-taking devolved upon petty constables, but as\r\nthe requisite tact and intelligence was not found in every parish, what\r\nwas called a running constable was usually appointed in each petty\r\nsessional division, who was considered the detective-officer of the\r\ndistrict.  Mr. Dawson was justly considered one of the first of his\r\nprofession.  Upon the formation of the new force these hitherto\r\nindispensable functionaries were entirely superseded, and Dawson, among\r\nothers, found his occupation gone.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n20.--There were no prisoners in Lynn gaol.  To celebrate the unique\r\ncircumstance the prison doors were thrown open, and the Mayor entertained\r\nthe whole of the police force and borough officials to a dinner, served\r\nwithin the building.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.--The Norwich Diocesan Training Institution for school-mistresses was\r\nremoved to spacious premises in St. George's Colegate.

He\r\nhad served sixteen years as a private in the 2nd Dragoon Guards.  \"Altho'\r\nof an obtuse and somewhat forbidding appearance, he possessed an uncommon\r\nfaculty for mathematical attainments.  He had Euclid at his finger ends,\r\nwhile his knowledge of algebra and logarithms enabled him to solve in a\r\nfew minutes the most difficult questions.  He once had the management of\r\na school, but his irregularities reduced him to the level of a common\r\nlabourer, and eventually he ended his days in the union house.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.*--\"The degree of Doctor of Music has been recently conferred on Mr.\r\nBuck, organist of Norwich Cathedral, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, in\r\nthe exercise of the privilege possessed by his Grace as Primate of\r\nbestowing that and other degrees in divinity and arts upon persons of\r\nmerit in any of those faculties.\"\r\n\r\n4.--An interesting ceremony took place in the tower of the dilapidated\r\nchurch of Eccles-next-the-Sea.  The Rev. Edward Evans, of St. Stephen's,\r\nNorwich, who had recently been presented to the vicarage, read himself\r\nin, and preached to a congregation of about 200 persons.  \"Owing to the\r\nwant of the church, which has been destroyed upwards of 200 years by the\r\nencroachments of the ocean, this is a sinecure benefice, and the\r\ninhabitants use the neighbouring church of Hempstead.

Excursionists are not expected to object to being\r\ncarried from Norwich to London for half a crown, but we should suppose\r\nthat the proprietors in the Eastern Union will have a decided objection\r\nto the great increase of their working expenses to 60 per cent. by the\r\nprocess.  The ruinous competition now going on can only be terminated by\r\na union of interests, and it appears, from the reports of the Eastern\r\nCounties' and Eastern Union Companies, that an amalgamation is proposed.\"\r\n\r\n--The kitchen floor of a house, occupied by Mr. Bunting, on St. Giles'\r\nHill (near St. Giles' Gates?), Norwich, suddenly gave way, and Mrs. and\r\nMiss Bunting, who were in the apartment, were precipitated with the\r\nchairs, table, and other furniture, into a funnel-shaped hole 27 feet in\r\ndepth.  When rescued they were insensible but uninjured.  \"Caves were\r\nsome time since cut through the hill in different directions and of\r\nconsiderable length, and the whole of the hill has been at various\r\nperiods excavated for chalk.  Some of the caves were used for wine\r\nvaults, and it appears that one of these caves passed under the back of\r\nMr. Bunting's house.

On the expiration of his articles in his 21st\r\nyear, he was elected organist of Boston parish church, and in the same\r\nyear graduated Mus. Bac. at Cambridge.  He afterwards published his\r\nConcert Fugues for the organ, which were played during the Great\r\nExhibition.

The only question that arose was about certain timber\r\ngrowing on the estate and fines of copyholds.  But a difficulty of a\r\nnovel character had occurred.  Since the murder the mansion had been\r\nuntenanted.  Although many persons were willing to take it they could not\r\nprocure servants who would live in the house, so great was the\r\nsuperstitious feeling which existed.  It was stated that the parties were\r\nwilling to allow the house to be occupied for two years for nothing, in\r\norder to overcome the prejudice.  The Vice-Chancellor said that Mrs.\r\nJermy Jermy was entitled to a third of the timber and fines, and he\r\nexpressed surprise that such prejudices existed against the house.\r\n\r\n3.--Died, at her residence on the Castle Meadow, Norwich, in her 85th\r\nyear, Amelia Opie, widow of John Opie, R.A., and only daughter of Dr.\r\nJames Alderson.

Money, visited\r\nthe scene of the struggle, and afterwards published \"A Journal of a Tour\r\nthrough part of France, Flanders and Holland, including a Visit to Paris\r\nand a Walk over the Field of Waterloo in the Summer of 1816.\"  The work\r\nwas dedicated to the Norwich United Friars Society, of which literary\r\nbody he was almost the last surviving member.  In 1828 appeared the\r\naccount of a second tour in Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and the\r\nNetherlands.  The book to which he devoted no inconsiderable portion of\r\nthe last ten years of his life was the complete \"Dictionary of Roman\r\nCoins.\"\r\n\r\n24*.--\"We have received from Mr. Garthon, one of the district surgeons of\r\nNorwich, a return in a tabular form showing the extraordinary number of\r\n96 cases of small-pox in Heigham and St. Benedict's, during the last\r\nthree months.

Mr. Gurney was a patron of the Turf and a genuine lover of old\r\nEnglish sports, but he was never known to bet.  His remains were\r\ninterred, on January 9th, at the Rosary Burial-ground, Norwich.\r\n\r\n3.--A heavy snowstorm, accompanied by a severe gale from the north,\r\npassed over the Eastern district.

This was an information filed by the Attorney-General, at\r\nthe relation of certain inhabitants of the city, against the trustees\r\nappointed under the Corporation Act, of two charities called the Free\r\nGrammar School and the Great Hospital.  The object of the information was\r\nto show that the Grammar School had not received a fair amount of the\r\nfunds of the charity, and that undue preference had been given to the\r\nHospital in their distribution.  A decree was made, directing a scheme to\r\nbe settled in Chambers.  On December 18th it was stated in the Rolls\r\nCourt that when the case was in Chambers a deed of covenant,\r\ncontemporaneous with the letters patent of King Edward VI., and to which\r\nthe Corporation were parties, had been found, by which the whole surplus,\r\nafter the stipulated payments, was to be applied to the sustentation of\r\nthe poor.  The question then before the Court was how far this varied the\r\ncase.  It was contended that the Hospital and the poor were entitled to\r\nthe entire surplus.  The Master of the Rolls was of opinion that the deed\r\ndid not control the letters patent, that no predominance or priority was\r\ngiven to one part of the charity over the other, and that the surplus\r\nrents should be equally divided, and in such a way as would be most\r\nconsistent with the intentions of the founder.  The case was taken before\r\nthe Chief Clerk to the Master of the Rolls on February 6th, 1855.  \"The\r\nresult is that upwards of 1,000 pounds per annum in addition to the\r\nproperty comprised in the charter will be secured for the general benefit\r\nof the charity, including, of course, the School.  The matter now stands\r\nover, in order that a scheme may be prepared for the general\r\nadministration of the charity under the sanction of the\r\nAttorney-General.\"  On April 7th, 1855, it was announced that the\r\nfollowing proposal had been made on the part of the \"promoters of the new\r\nGrammar School\" as to the future division of the funds \"hitherto\r\nbelonging to the Great Hospital\": \"That the present salary of the\r\nchaplain of the said Hospital be increased 100 pounds per annum, he\r\nhaving at present 200 pounds per annum besides his residence; that one\r\nmoiety of the net income of the charity be annually applied for the\r\nbenefit of the School and the objects thereof, and that the other moiety\r\nbe applied for the benefit of the poor in the Hospital; and that no\r\nfurther election of inmates shall be allowed to take place until the\r\nnumber shall by death or other causes be reduced to 100, and that until\r\nthe numbers shall be so reduced, the expenses occasioned thereby shall be\r\nprovided for out of the savings of the trust and now invested in the sum\r\nof 11,500 pounds Consols, or out of any other monies in the hands of the\r\ndefendants.\"  Another meeting was held in Chambers on May 9th, 1855, when\r\nthe trustees strongly opposed the heads of the scheme; thereupon it was\r\nproposed that the Chief Clerk should proceed to Norwich and hold an\r\ninquiry.  The trustees claimed the right to appeal against his decision,\r\nif necessary, and the Chief Clerk then declined to accede to the\r\nproposal.  The trustees were invited to carry in the counter claim, but\r\nrefused to do so.

The Church of England withholds from me the justice\r\nof that tribunal which the civil law grants to the common murderer.  Such\r\nis the spirit of that Church which professedly invites even a prodigal to\r\nrepentance; I have spent 1,800 pounds in her service, and have been\r\ndriven to pass three nights in the streets of Norwich, and six nights in\r\na lock-up (a hole where there is only straw to lie upon on a stone\r\nfloor), solely for the want of better and proper accommodation.  The\r\nMayor and magistrates have encouraged me to apply to everyone that has a\r\nheart to feel for the miseries of a fellow-creature.  I earnestly solicit\r\nthe sympathy and charity of an enlightened public to enable me to live\r\nday by day and to defend myself by law from the tyranny and persecution\r\nof the Bishop of Norwich.--Henry Herring, late curate of North Pickenham,\r\nNorfolk.

A room capable of seating\r\nupwards of 200 visitors has been very tastefully fitted up by the\r\nproprietor, the walls being adorned by a series of Norwich views\r\nexceedingly well painted by our scenic artist for many years, Mr. Thorne,\r\nand every evening there is a vocal and instrumental concert by parties of\r\nLondon professionals, who are almost weekly changed, so as to secure as\r\nlarge an amount of novelty as possible.  Another new feature in this city\r\nis the introduction of the imperial measure for wine at the old rate of\r\n2s. 6d. per pint.\"  This place, known as \"The Shades,\" was managed by Mr.\r\nFred Phillips, and was the first music hall or variety entertainment in\r\nthe city.

The minutes of the proceedings of the visiting\r\njustices at an inquiry held by them on June 22nd were read.  Dr. Hull\r\nalleged that the Rev. ---, then acting as chaplain at the Asylum, had\r\nbeen wrongly admitted as a patient.  In his evidence he stated that in\r\nJune, 1852, Mr. Nichols informed him that a country clergyman, a member\r\nof a high county family, had committed a rape, that his family wished to\r\nmake him out to be mad, and that, in order to save him from a criminal\r\nprosecution, they desired to get him into a mad-house.  Mr. Nichols\r\nrequested Dr. Hull to grant a second medical certificate.  Dr. Hull\r\nrefused to comply.  Mr. Nichols emphatically denied that he had used the\r\nexpressions attributed to him by Dr. Hull.  The justices came to the\r\nconclusion: \"(1) That the Rev. Mr. ---, by being placed in the asylum\r\nunder the circumstances disclosed in the inquiry, was rescued from the\r\ngrip of the law on a criminal charge; (2) that the order and medical\r\ncertificates upon which he was admitted into the asylum were regular and\r\nin the form prescribed by the Act of Parliament; (3) that in the opinion\r\nof the visitors the Rev. Mr. --- is not a proper person to have been\r\nappointed or to continue to officiate as chaplain to the asylum.\"  A\r\nletter from the office of the Commissioners in Lunacy was read, in which\r\nthey stated they were satisfied that when the Rev. Mr. --- was admitted\r\nhe was a proper person to be placed under medical care in the asylum.  It\r\nwas also asserted that the Commissioners had recognised him as the\r\nchaplain of the asylum.  Mr. Palmer, who had moved that the licence to\r\nHeigham Hall be refused, ultimately withdrew his motion, and the incident\r\nterminated.  At a meeting of the city magistrates in December, a memorial\r\nwas addressed to the Secretary of State, asking that a \"searching\r\ninvestigation be made, with power to call before the Commissioners all\r\nparties who may be able to give evidence upon the various points embraced\r\nin the case.\"  (No further action was taken.)\r\n\r\n18.--The new bridge at Yarmouth was opened by the chairman and members of\r\nthe Haven and Pier Commission.

The loss of Mr. Richard Gurney struck a blow\r\nat it almost fatal.  This was followed by the withdrawal of Mr. Hamond\r\nand others, leaving the club originally consisting of all the letters of\r\nthe alphabet reduced to two members.  Although disappointed by the\r\ncurtailment of the sports of the field, it was determined that the ladies\r\nshould have the assembly as usual.  It was held on Tuesday (the 7th), but\r\nit was known that none of the Club would be there to meet them as\r\nheretofore.\"  The fortunes of the Club could only be restored, it was\r\nsaid, by throwing the meeting open to all England.\r\n\r\n9.--Mr. Robert Chamberlin was elected Mayor, and Mr. R.

This was a will case, which\r\nexcited considerable interest on account of the large amount of property\r\nin dispute and the number of persons concerned.  The plaintiff was Miss\r\nMary Ann Fisher, and the nominal defendant Mr. Philip Blundell Nisbett.\r\nThe actual defendant was Mr. Richard Blundell Nisbett.  The question at\r\nissue was the validity of the will of a lady named Nisbett.  The amount\r\nin dispute was between 20,000 and 30,000 pounds in real property, and a\r\nlarger amount in personal property.  The father of Mrs. Nisbett was a Mr.\r\nFisher, a banker, of Yarmouth.  Mary Ann Fisher, the plaintiff, was one\r\nof his daughters.  All the children were dead in 1854 with the exception\r\nof Mary Ann Fisher.  In the year 1811, when the deceased Mrs. Nisbett\r\nmarried, her father settled on her the sum of 10,000 pounds, and gave her\r\nduring life an annuity of 500 pounds, while all that Mr. Nisbett brought\r\nwas the sum of 7,000 pounds.  In 1824 Mr. Nisbett died.  Of the marriage\r\nthere were three sons; two had died, and at the time of the trial the\r\nonly one living was the eldest, Philip Blundell Nisbett, a confirmed\r\nlunatic.  In the year 1835 Mr. Fisher died, leaving property to the\r\namount of about 100,000 pounds.  Mrs. Nisbett, after her father's death,\r\nleft the bulk of the property to Philip Blundell Nisbett.  There now\r\nappeared on the scene Mr. Richard Blundell Nisbett, a son of Mr.\r\nNisbett's brother, and nephew by marriage to Mrs. Nesbitt.  He took out a\r\ncommission of lunacy against Philip, who was found to be a lunatic and\r\nincapable of managing his own affairs.  Then he endeavoured to get a\r\ncommission of lunacy against Mrs. Nisbett, but the Lord Chancellor, on\r\nreceiving the report of the medical men who examined her, dismissed the\r\npetition, with costs.  As soon as Mrs. Nisbett discovered the course that\r\nRichard was pursuing, she made a new will, the effect of which was that\r\nthe property went to Miss Fisher, the plaintiff, for life, and after her\r\ndeath to blood relations.  On November 10th, 1854, Mrs. Nisbett died\r\nsuddenly, and these legal proceedings commenced.  After evidence had been\r\ngiven by medical men and others, the Attorney-General (Sir Alexander\r\nCockburn) who appeared for the defendant, unexpectedly withdrew from the\r\ncase, and a verdict was entered for the plaintiff.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--Died at Malta, of wounds received before Sebastopol, on June 18th, in\r\nthe attack upon the Redan, Lieut.

He was a\r\nson of Mr. Thomas Wodehouse, by a daughter of Mr. Pryce Campbell, of\r\nStackpole Court, Pembrokeshire.  In 1809 he married his cousin, Lucy,\r\ndaughter of the Rev. Philip Wodehouse, by whom he had four children, two\r\nsons and two daughters.  In 1817 he offered himself as candidate for\r\nNorfolk, in opposition to Mr. Pratt; he was returned, and retained his\r\nseat until the General Election in 1830.  At that time the excitement of\r\nthe Reform agitation was at its height, which, with other circumstances,\r\ninduced him to decline a contest.  In that year Mr. T. W. Coke\r\n(afterwards Earl of Leicester) was returned with Sir W. J. H. B. ffolkes.\r\nIn 1832 Mr. Keppel and Mr. Windham were returned.  When the political\r\nexcitement of the former period had subsided, Mr. Wodehouse again\r\nappeared before the constituency, and at the General Election in 1835 he\r\nand Lord Walpole were returned, in opposition to Mr. Windham and Mr.\r\nRichard Hanbury Gurney.  Another General Election took place in 1837, and\r\nMr. Wodehouse was returned with Mr. Henry Negus Burroughes, in opposition\r\nto the same Liberal candidates.  In 1842 Mr. Wodehouse and Mr. Burroughes\r\nwere again elected; Sir W. J. H. B. ffolkes, who was abroad at the time,\r\nwas nominated without his consent as the Liberal candidate.  Both\r\nConservative candidates were re-elected without opposition in 1847.  Mr.\r\nWodehouse sat in Parliament about forty years.  He was a Conservative of\r\nthe old school, a Protectionist, and a zealous supporter of Sir Robert\r\nPeel until he introduced his Free Trade measures.

On the previous evening, he stated, a number of persons\r\npresented themselves at the dress-box entrance and demanded admission\r\nwith, silver tickets.  He informed them that the majority of places had\r\nbeen taken by those who had paid, but the upper circle was open to silver\r\nticket holders.  Some noise and disturbance ensued.  Sir William Foster\r\ncame up and endeavoured to gain an entrance, Mr. Coleman tried to prevent\r\nhim, a scuffle ensued, and the police were sent for by both parties.\r\nInspector Amis came, and Mr. Coleman directed his attention to a notice\r\non the play-bill that no one would be admitted to the dress circle\r\nwithout a reserved seat ticket.  Mr. Coleman asked the inspector to\r\nremove the persons who were seeking to gain an entrance; and they, in\r\nturn, requested the inspector to remove Mr. Coleman.  The officer, it was\r\nasserted, made an unprovoked and violent assault upon Mr. Coleman, who\r\ndenied that silver ticket holders had the privilege to enter the house,\r\nand told them that they must legally prove their right.  He had taken the\r\nTheatre for two nights only, at a heavy rental, there was no arrangement\r\nin the agreement with the manager as to the proprietors of silver\r\ntickets, and that was why he had put the notice on the bills.  Mr. Hudson\r\n(a magistrate) remarked that the owners of silver tickets were owners of\r\nthe Theatre, and had a right to go in when they pleased.  Sir William\r\nFoster attended the Court, and stated that unless Mr. Coleman apologised\r\nhe would take proceedings against him.  Mr. Coleman said he was sorry if\r\nSir William Foster had been injured (his waistcoat was torn to ribbons),\r\nbut beyond that he should make no apology.  The case against Amis was\r\ndismissed.  Silver ticket holders were admitted without opposition on the\r\nevening of the 21st.\r\n\r\n23.--Died at Norwich, in his 87th year, Mr. John Francis, manufacturer,\r\nwho served the office of Sheriff in 1837.\r\n\r\n24.--The foundation-stone of a new chapel on Hempton Green, Fakenham, was\r\nlaid.

The improvement was badly\r\ndesigned, and has cost almost as much already as the cost would have been\r\nof pulling down one side of the street entirely.  From first to last at\r\nleast 20,000 pounds has been expended, and the whole street is a bungle\r\nafter all.

A fine bullock, weighing 80 stones, was killed on the 21st,\r\nsteamed on the 23rd, and roasted whole on the 25th in a temporary kitchen\r\nspecially erected by Mr. Plowright, of Swaffham.

Three tents, each 130 ft. in length, were provided for the\r\naccommodation of the guests, who numbered upwards of 550.  The toast of\r\n\"Miss Mitford, the future Mrs. Amhurst,\" was drunk with great enthusiasm,\r\nand a series of athletic sports concluded the festivities.  [_Note_: The\r\nspelling of the names in the original paragraph is adhered to.  William\r\nG. T. Daniel Tyssen by licence exchanged the name of Daniel Tyssen for\r\nTyssen-Amhurst: his son, by a second licence, altered it to William\r\nAmhurst Tyssen-Amherst.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--The close of the season at Norwich Theatre was marked by the public\r\npresentation to Mr. William Sidney of a handsome silver salver and vase,\r\n\"in recognition of his judicious management as lessee.\"  It was one of\r\nthe most successful seasons that had been recorded for many years.\r\n\r\n7.--Died at her house in Green Park Buildings, Bath, aged 76, Lady Betty,\r\nwidow of Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Berry, Bart., K.C.B., and eldest\r\ndaughter of Dr. Forster, formerly headmaster of the Norwich Free Grammar\r\nSchool.\r\n\r\n11.--The centenary of the opening of the Octagon Chapel, Norwich, was\r\ncelebrated.

The question was whether the directors of the\r\ncompany were entitled to levy contributions upon shareholders, in order\r\nto pay certain sums advanced or borrowed by them for carrying on the\r\nbusiness of the company, which had become insolvent.  Originally\r\nprojected in 1833, with the view of relieving the distress which at that\r\ntime affected the poor of Norwich, the company struggled on with\r\nincreasing difficulties for sixteen years, until in 1850 it was wound up\r\nby order of the Court.  His lordship now discharged altogether a question\r\nof fraud on the part of the directors.  He was of opinion that the\r\ndirectors were entitled to be allowed all sums advanced by them, with\r\nsimple interest at five per cent., and to be repaid that amount as far as\r\nthe sum in Court would extend, with payment of the costs, and afterwards\r\nby a surplus raised by a call from the contributors in proportion to the\r\nnumber of shares held by them respectively, and that the cost of the\r\nproceedings must be borne by the estate of the company.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--The Rev.

The one in the Museum was obtained by the Rev.\r\nJames Brown, at Limpenhoe, in the early part of the century.\"\r\n\r\n21.--At a meeting held at the Norfolk Hotel, Norwich, it was decided to\r\nestablish a pack of foxhounds in Norfolk, and to invite Lord Suffield to\r\nbecome master.

The principal vocalists were Madame\r\nRudersdorff, Miss Dolby, Mr. George Perren, Mr. A. Mann, Mr. Weiss, and\r\nMr. Thomas.  A performance of the same oratorio, under the personal\r\ndirection of the composer, had already been advertised by Mr. Gedge, of\r\nHeigham Grove.  The Mayor (Mr. J. G. Johnson) had given permission for\r\nthe use of the hall, and his action was sharply criticised at the\r\nmeetings of the Town Council and in letters to the newspapers.  The\r\nfollowing announcement was published on July 19th: \"'Eli,' for the\r\nbenefit of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, under the direction of Mr.\r\nCosta.  Postponed.  Mr. Gedge respectfully informs the public of the\r\ncounty and city that, as the Town Council has thought fit to set aside\r\nthe Mayor's prerogative and fixing a day for the performance in\r\nopposition to the one he announced under the early sanction and promise\r\nof the Mayor for the Assize week, in St. Andrew's Hall, and as the\r\nCouncil thought fit, at their last meeting, to determine on other\r\nrestrictive demands, of which he received a legal notice this day, he has\r\nresolved to postpone 'Eli,' under Mr. Costa's direction, until a future\r\nopportunity, when he trusts he shall be able to benefit the charities and\r\nat the same time to gratify the public.\"\r\n\r\n26.--On this date was published a report of the action, Beaven _v._ Lord\r\nHastings, heard before the Vice-Chancellor, Sir W. P. Wood.  This was a\r\nbill by a bond creditor of Edward Astley, deceased, praying an account of\r\nthe sum due for principal and interest upon his bond, and a decree for\r\npayment against the defendant, Lord Hastings, on the ground that he had\r\nmade himself personally liable to pay the debt without regard to a\r\nsufficiency of the assets of the late Edward Astley.  The bill also\r\nbrought the declaration that the defendant had constituted himself\r\nexecutor _de son tort_ of the intestate Edward Astley, and was\r\naccountable on that footing to the plaintiff as the rightful\r\nadministrator of the intestate.  Mr. Astley, who resided at Eneilles, in\r\nBelgium, having borrowed 1040 pounds from the plaintiff, gave his bond,\r\ndated July 3rd, 1845, by which he became bound to the plaintiff in the\r\npenal sum of 2,080 pounds, with the condition for defeasance upon payment\r\non July 3rd, 1847, of 1,040 pounds with interest at 5 per cent.  A\r\nwarrant of attorney at even date was executed by Edward Astley, but no\r\njudgment was ever actually entered up under the warrant.  In April, 1846,\r\nthe dead body of Edward Astley was found, with marks of violence upon it,\r\nin the River Ourthe in Belgium.  Lord Hastings and his mother, Dame\r\nHester Astley, his sole next-of-kin, proceeded to Eneilles with his\r\nsolicitor, and applied to the Juges de Paix to remove the seals and give\r\nhim possession of his brother's property.  A _proces verbal_ having been\r\nsigned, possession of the property, \"without description or inventory,\"\r\nwas delivered to Lord Hastings, who, by thus taking possession _pur et\r\nsimple_ became personally liable, according to the Belgian law, to pay\r\nthe debts of the intestate, without reference to the value of assets.\r\nThe Vice-Chancellor dismissed the bill, on the ground that the defendant,\r\nwho had legally received the property in Belgium, could not be sued in\r\nEngland as executor _de son tort_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--General Windham was received in Norwich with a great demonstration of\r\nwelcome, on his return to his native county.

A banquet, attended by officers of the Army and Navy\r\nconnected with Norfolk and Norwich who had served in the Crimea, was\r\ngiven in honour of the General, at St. Andrew's Hall.  The Earl of\r\nAlbemarle presided, and on behalf of the subscribers to the Windham\r\nTestimonial Fund, presented the General with a service sword and a dress\r\nsword.\r\n\r\n2.--Several deaths were reported to have occurred from small-pox at Lynn.\r\n\"In no instance has death ensued here after vaccination.\"\r\n\r\n9.--It was reported that at the Suffolk Assizes, at Ipswich, an action\r\nwas brought by the Commissioners of Yarmouth Harbour, in the name of\r\ntheir clerk (Mr. Preston), pursuant to the direction of the Master of the\r\nRolls, against the Norfolk and Eastern Counties Railway Company.  The\r\nplaintiff complained that the defendants had wrongfully diverted and\r\nobstructed the waters of the Yare, the Wensum, and the Waveney, which of\r\nright ought to flow into and through Yarmouth Harbour, and had turned\r\nthem into Lake Lothing, and thence into the sea through Lowestoft\r\nHarbour.  The Eastern Union, the Norfolk, and the Eastern Counties\r\nRailways, had entered into an agreement for amalgamation, by virtue of\r\nwhich the latter company assumed the entire control over the network of\r\nrailways constructed by those companies and the East Anglian Company,\r\nand, among other matters, they undertook the duties created by the\r\nNorwich and Lowestoft Navigation Act, one of which was the maintenance of\r\nMutford Bridge where Lake Lothing joined Oulton Broad, for the double\r\npurpose of keeping in the fresh waters of the Yare and Waveney and\r\npreserving them for the use of Yarmouth Harbour, and of keeping out the\r\nwaters of the sea, which would otherwise flood all the low lands at high\r\nwater.  These duties had not been discharged to the satisfaction of the\r\nplaintiffs.  After discussion, terms of reference to Mr. B. Andrew, Q.C.,\r\nwere arranged, the defendants undertaking to repair the locks at once,\r\nthe plaintiffs being let in to complain of acts of omission as well as of\r\ncommission on the part of the defendants.  A verdict was then taken for\r\nthe plaintiffs, subject to a special case.  (_See_ January 26th, 1858.)\r\n\r\n15.--Lieut.-Col. Edwin Wodehouse, C.B., Royal Artillery, on revisiting\r\nhis former home at Hingham, after his return from the Crimea, was\r\npresented with an address by the inhabitants of the town.  He was the\r\neldest son of Admiral Wodehouse.  At Inkerman a battery called\r\n\"Wodehouse's Battery\" was furiously attacked and nearly all the men cut\r\ndown by overpowering numbers of the enemy.  By heroic courage and\r\ndetermination he rescued from the enemy the three guns lost early in the\r\naction.  Two slugs passed through his cloak, and one, if not two, horses\r\nwere killed under him.\r\n\r\n18.--The London Grand Opera Company commenced a season at the Theatre\r\nRoyal, Norwich.

E. Benest, city surveyor.  The Council declined to adopt the\r\nscheme, on the ground that the city could not afford to undertake it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--A storm of great severity occurred.  The district in which it was\r\nmost felt was across the track of marsh land lying between Bungay and\r\nOrmesby.  At Yarmouth the outbreak began at six p.m., and lasted till\r\nmidnight.

Firioli, Signor Belletti, Mr. Charles Braham, Signor Beneventano,\r\nand Signor Pilotti.\r\n\r\n27.*--\"During the past fortnight the catch of herrings at Yarmouth has\r\nbeen almost unprecedented in the annals of the fisheries.  In many\r\ninstances the boats have entered the harbour so heavily laden that their\r\ngunwales were almost level with the water.  In the last ten days it is\r\ncomputed that the quantity of herrings brought in and landed here from\r\nthe various boats has reached the enormous daily average of 100 lasts, or\r\n1,320,000 fish.  From 12 pounds 10s. to 14 pounds per last has been\r\nrealised; but in some cases this abundance of fish has proved most\r\ndisastrous to the owners, entailing the loss of the boats' nets, stores,\r\n&c.  Mr. J. T. Frosdick has sustained in this way the entire loss of the\r\nnets of two boats, to the serious extent of 450 pounds, for, owing to the\r\nenormous catch of fish, the men were quite unable to draw the nets on\r\nboard, and ultimately the weight proved so great that they sunk the nets\r\nand all to the bottom of the sea.\"\r\n\r\n30.--The festival of the Choir Benevolent Fund was held at Norwich\r\nCathedral.  In addition to those of Norwich, choirs from London, Ely,\r\nCambridge, Rochester, Peterborough, and Canterbury took part.

Canon of\r\nNorwich, and for fifty years vicar of St. Andrew's, Norwich.  \"For more\r\nthan twenty years chaplain of the county prison, he was one of the\r\nearliest advocates of educational efforts being directed towards\r\nprisoners, and in his practical suggestions may be traced the germ of\r\nmuch that is valuable in our reformatory institutions.  He lived long\r\nenough to see similar views generally adopted and made compulsory by the\r\nState.  His duties as chaplain were performed during a period when\r\ncapital punishments were much more frequent than now, and this gave him\r\nthe opportunity of seeing vice in its most degrading forms, and to hear\r\nfrom the lips of its victims the repentance which the certain approach of\r\ndeath and judgment generally extracted from them.\"\r\n\r\n6.--The church of the Holy Trinity, Hempton Green, was opened by the\r\nBishop of Norwich.\r\n\r\n--The corner-stone of the new Corn Hall at Aylsham was laid by the\r\nMarquis of Lothian.\r\n\r\n7.--Died at Calais, aged 60, Capt.

The accident was occasioned by the breaking of the\r\ntire of the leading wheel of the engine.  A few minutes after the\r\naccident a goods up-train ran into the tender of the disabled engine, but\r\nonly a slight collision resulted.\r\n\r\n10.--Mr. Robert Chamberlin was elected Mayor, and Mr. Robert Seaman\r\nappointed Sheriff of Norwich.\r\n\r\n13.--A sculling match, for 100 pounds, between Henry Kelly, of Fulham,\r\nand Richard Buttle, of Norwich, was rowed on the Thames, from Putney to\r\nMortlake.  Kelly won, by little more than half a boat's length.  Time, 25\r\nminutes.  The return match was fixed to take place on the Yare, from\r\nSurlingham to Thorpe, on November 25th, but owing to a dispute as to the\r\nappointment of referee, the race was postponed until the 26th, when\r\nKelly, who rowed the distance, about 4.5 miles, in 37.5 minutes, won\r\neasily.\r\n\r\n19.--Died, the Right Hon.

Sir Edward Hall Alderson, Baron of her Majesty's Court of Exchequer.\r\nHe was the eldest son of Mr. Robert Alderson, barrister-at-law, and\r\nRecorder of Norwich, by the daughter of Mr. Samuel Hurry, of Great\r\nYarmouth, where he was born in 1787.  He received his early education at\r\nthe Charter House and at Caius College, Cambridge.

According to the opening statement of Mr. Serjeant\r\nByles, Capt. Black felt himself aggrieved that Mr. English should be\r\nstyled Chief Constable of Norwich, and wrote to the Watch Committee\r\nseveral letters upon the subject, stating that Mr. English's assumed\r\ntitle, instead of his proper title, \"superintendent of police,\" had\r\ncaused him (Capt. Black) obstruction and official inconvenience in the\r\ndischarge of his duties.  These letters had no effect, and Capt. Black\r\nthen published handbills reflecting upon the personal character of Mr.\r\nEnglish.

He was not anxious to become a councillor, but the\r\ndefendants promised to \"see him through,\" and on the night before the\r\nelection distinctly guaranteed him that he should be reimbursed any\r\noutlay incurred beyond the sum of 10 pounds.  Mr. Cobb was defeated at\r\nthe poll.  It was not denied that the guarantee was given, but it was\r\ncontended that, in order to render it valid to support the action, it\r\nshould have been in writing, which it was not.

The endless railway\r\nconsists of a series of flat boards, six in number, plated with iron on\r\nboth sides of each wheel, equal in length to the radius of the wheel, and\r\nfrom 10 to 16 inches in width, loosely attached to the felloe of the\r\nwheel in such a manner that they are carried round with it as it\r\nrevolves.  Each in succession is laid flat on the ground in front of the\r\nwheel, and lifted up in its rear as soon as passed over.  On the surface\r\nof the boards next the periphery of the wheel an iron rail is fixed, on\r\nwhich the wheel runs, the boards thus corresponding to the sleepers of an\r\nordinary railway, so that the wheels carry their own rails and sleepers\r\nwith them, laying down a literally endless railway whenever they are set\r\nin motion.\"\r\n\r\n11.--A meeting was held in the old Library Room, St. Andrew's Hall,\r\nNorwich, \"to take into consideration the expediency of forming a society\r\nto prevent persons from taking and destroying fish by illegal practices.\"\r\nIt was resolved, \"That an anglers' society be established in Norwich,\r\nwith the view of aiding the authorities in preventing illegal fishing,\r\nand also for promoting the rational recreation of the members.\"  The\r\nsociety was called \"The Norwich and Norfolk Anglers' Society,\" and Mr.\r\nSkippon was appointed honorary secretary.\r\n\r\n13.--Mr. Thackeray gave the first of two lectures at St. Andrew's Hall,\r\nNorwich.

We\r\nhave reason to believe that in some instances those who paid for tickets\r\nfor the second evening intentionally absented themselves.\"  Letters were\r\npublished in the NORFOLK CHRONICLE expressing strong disapproval of\r\nThackeray's strictures upon the personal characters of the Georges.\r\n\r\n18.--The polling for the election of a Coroner for the Lynn district, to\r\nfill the vacancy occasioned by the death of Mr. George Sayle, commenced\r\nat Lynn.  The candidates were Mr. Jeffery and Mr. Wilkin.  \"An\r\nextraordinary degree of energy was displayed in bringing up the voters in\r\nall parts of the district, and the expenses incurred in paying railway\r\nand coach fares, breakfasts, and dinners for the voters and hangers on\r\n(to say nothing of the sum of money lavished in other ways to obtain\r\ntheir suffrages, added to the usual outlay upon a contested election),\r\nmust have amounted to something enormous, considering the pecuniary value\r\nof the office at stake, probably at the best averaging 25 or 30 pounds a\r\nyear.\"  The poll closed on the 19th, when Mr. Wilkin was declared\r\nelected.\r\n\r\n18.--Mr. and Mrs. Charles Dillon commenced a three nights' engagement at\r\nNorwich Theatre in \"Othello,\" \"Belphegor,\" and \"Faint Heart Never Won\r\nFair Lady.\"\r\n\r\n--A meeting was held at the Lecture Hall, Norwich, at which resolutions\r\nwere passed condemning the Law of Settlement, and advocating the\r\nintroduction of a national rate.

Clasper's\r\nboat was the lighter by several pounds, and in length exceeded the\r\nNorwich man's craft by about four feet.  Wright had the better of the\r\nstart, but in ten strokes Clasper led by a quarter of a length.  At\r\nBramerton, however, Wright obtained a clear lead, and at Wood's End led\r\nby four lengths.  Clasper made a desperate spurt, and got nearly abreast\r\nof his antagonist, who won by a length, in 23.5 minutes.  The Newcastle\r\nman suffered severely from exhaustion, and was lifted from his boat in a\r\nhelpless condition.

It is a _rechauffe_ of the lie circulated some\r\nthirty years since in a London journal as a hoax, I presume, on the\r\neditor.  At the time I did not think it worthy of contradiction, nor at\r\nmy age should I deem it worthy of any such contradiction now, but am\r\nsolely induced to do so for the satisfaction of those most justly dear to\r\nme.--Yours, &c., ORFORD.  May 26th, 1857.'\"  (The paragraph here alluded\r\nto is the much-quoted reply purported to have been sent by the noble lord\r\nto the secretary of the Norwich Bible Society.  It originally appeared in\r\nthe \"Freemen's Journal,\" Dublin.)\r\n\r\n31.--Died at his residence, Brighton, Mr. Charles Edmund Rumbold, of\r\nPreston Candover, Hants., aged 69.

Above the gate are the arms\r\nof Henry VII., the arms of the Goldsmiths' Company, to which its builder,\r\nMr. John Bassingham, belonged, and of the city of Norwich.

The testator, Sir\r\nJohn Lombe, had left a large fund, to be applied to the purpose of\r\nbuilding a mansion on his estate in Norfolk, with a direction that the\r\nfund should accumulate until the house was finished.  Considerable delay\r\ntook place in completing the house, and the fund increased to a very\r\nlarge amount, leaving a surplus of about 20,000 pounds.  The\r\nVice-Chancellor directed the fund to be applied to building purposes at a\r\ntime when it was not known that the surplus would be so large, but the\r\norder was made without prejudice to any question as to the surplus.  This\r\nsurplus was now claimed by the representatives of the successive tenants\r\nfor life, on the ground that they (the tenants for life) had been\r\ndeprived of the enjoyment of the house, and were, therefore, entitled to\r\nthe fund by way of compensation.

The jury, after a long hearing, returned a\r\nverdict for the Crown, with the rider: \"We find that there was a public\r\nhighway over Lion Hill, and we find that there is an obstruction of that\r\npart occupied by the Corn Exchange Company, but we find that the public\r\nare materially benefited by the alteration, and on the second count we\r\nfind for the defendants.\"  (_See_ May 5th, 1858.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.--Robert Bunn, \"the celebrated pedestrian,\" on the Ipswich Road,\r\nNorwich, ran a mile against time for a wager of 25 pounds.  \"The wager\r\nwas that he would not cover the distance in 4 minutes 45 secs.

H. Tillett moved,\r\n\"That an inquiry be held respecting the manner in which appointments to\r\nthe city magistracy are made, and also the manner in which the\r\nmagisterial business of this city is conducted, with the view to the\r\nadoption of any measures which may appear likely to promote the better\r\nadministration of justice.\"  The motion was adopted.  The committee of\r\ninquiry reported in February that they considered \"the mode in which the\r\nmagistracy is appointed in cities and boroughs is highly objectionable,\r\nthe appointments being the result of party influence,\" and recommended\r\nfor the magistracy \"those gentlemen who have served the office of Mayor\r\nto the satisfaction of the Council.\"  Complaints were made that from\r\nexcitement or infirmity of temper certain gentlemen made use of language\r\nderogatory to their position, and tending to lower the respect of the\r\nBench, and these complaints the Committee found were not groundless.  On\r\nMarch 16th the Town Council adopted a series of resolutions, requesting\r\nthe Mayor to address a letter to those gentlemen whose names appeared in\r\nthe report as having never attended petty sessions, or as having rarely\r\nor sometimes attended, requiring them to take upon themselves to\r\ndischarge the duties of their office; that a rota of attendance be\r\nestablished; and that, \"in relation to the unseemly proceedings which\r\nhave taken place in the Sword Room, the Council forbear to memorialise\r\nthe Lord Chancellor on the subject, in the hope that similar proceedings\r\nwill not occur again.\"\r\n\r\n25.--The marriage of the Princess Royal was celebrated in Norwich by the\r\nringing of the bells of St. Peter Mancroft, and by public dinners at the\r\nRoyal Hotel.  A ball took place in the evening, at St. Andrew's Hall.\r\nThe day was similarly observed at Yarmouth, Lynn, and other towns in the\r\ncounty, and addresses of congratulation were afterwards sent to the Queen\r\nby the respective Corporations.\r\n\r\n26.--The long-pending case, Preston _v._ the Eastern Counties and Norfolk\r\nRailway Companies, was before the Court of Exchequer, and Mr. Baron\r\nWatson delivered judgment.  The first count of the declaration charged\r\nthe defendants with diverting and obstructing the waters of the rivers,\r\nand the second with omitting to repair certain locks, whereby the water\r\nescaped.  Judgment was given against the Eastern Counties Railway Company\r\nfor 40s. on all issues, and for the Norfolk Railway Company on their plea\r\nof not guilty, but against them on all other issues.  Finally the case\r\nwas before the Rolls Court on June 8th, and was entered as the\r\nAttorney-General _v._ the Norfolk and Eastern Counties Railway Companies.\r\nThe object of the information was to have it declared that the defendants\r\nwere not by their Acts of Parliament empowered to divert or obstruct any\r\nof the waters of the Rivers Yare and Waveney, or other waters connected\r\nwith them, except Lake Lothing, for the purpose of supplying the entrance\r\nout between Lake Lothing and the sea with water.

Both members of Parliament\r\nexpressed themselves in favour of national rating.\r\n\r\n8.--Mr. Thomas Barnes, R.G.S., was presented by the Corporation of King's\r\nLynn with an \"honorary address,\" in lieu of the freedom of the borough,\r\n\"disallowed by the Municipal Reform Act.\"  Mr. Baines, the son of a ship\r\ncaptain of the town, was a self-taught artist, who achieved for himself a\r\nvery honourable position by his own enterprise and industry.  He was\r\nserving as a volunteer at the Cape when he was selected as artist to\r\naccompany the North Australian Exploring Expedition, under Mr. Gregory.\r\nAt the time of the presentation he was about to join Livingstone, on his\r\nexpedition into the heart of Africa.  Mr. Baines had already received\r\nconsiderable honours from the Royal Geographical Society, of which he was\r\na member, and from other learned bodies.\r\n\r\n12.--A public meeting was held at the Guildhall, Norwich, to consider a\r\nBill then before Parliament introduced for the purpose of amalgamating\r\nthe Norwich Gas Company with the British Gas Company.  A resolution was\r\nadopted affirming that the operation of the proposed Bill would be very\r\nprejudicial to the interests of the ratepayers and inhabitants, by\r\nplacing the future management of the gas supply in the hands of a company\r\nwhich had no local connection or sympathy with the interests of Norwich,\r\nand over whom the rate-payers and inhabitants would have no control.  The\r\nmeeting having heard the report of the Special Committee appointed by the\r\nCorporation, cordially approved the course adopted by the Committee, and\r\npledged itself to use every effort to oppose the passing of the Bill.  A\r\npetition was addressed to the House of Commons against the Bill, and on\r\nthe 16th the Town Council adopted the same petition.  The House of\r\nCommons Committee on Private Bills sat on April 20th, for the purpose of\r\nhearing objections to the measure.  The proceedings closed on the 23rd,\r\nwhen the Bill was ordered to be reported to the House.\r\n\r\n27.*--\"Sir Henry Stracey, of Rackheath Hall, has obtained provisional\r\nprotection for a cartridge which, by a very simple contrivance, gets rid\r\nof the necessity of biting off the end, a proceeding which is always\r\nobjectionable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--Lord Stanley was re-elected member of Parliament for the borough of\r\nKing's Lynn, on his appointment as Secretary to the Colonial Department.\r\nOn June 5th his lordship was again re-elected, on accepting the\r\npresidency of the Board of Control, vacated by Lord Ellenborough.\r\n\r\n--Died at his residence, South Quay, Yarmouth, Sir Eaton Stanley Travers.\r\nA son of Mr. John Travers, of Hethyfield Grange, co. Cork, he was born in\r\n1782, and entered the Navy September 15th, 1798, as midshipman, on board\r\nthe Juno.  He saw much active service, and was nine times mentioned in\r\ndespatches.  He was nominated K.H. on February 4th, 1834, and on March\r\n5th in the same year had conferred upon him the honour of knighthood.\r\nSir Eaton Travers was a Deputy Lieutenant of Norfolk.  He married in\r\nApril, 1815, Anne, eldest daughter of William Steward, of Yarmouth, by\r\nwhom he had issue five sons and two daughters.\r\n\r\n6.*--\"Within the last few days a stone has been placed in the churchyard\r\nat East Dereham, in memory of Jean de Narde, a French prisoner of war,\r\nwho, in the year 1796 while _en route_ from Yarmouth to Norman Cross\r\nprison, was lodged in the lower chamber of the bell tower of the church,\r\nand escaped therefrom.  He was pursued by the guard, and, after some\r\nsearch, was espied in a tree on the Scarning Road, and when summoned by a\r\nsoldier to descend and surrender he did not comply.  His non-compliance\r\nforfeited his life, for he was shot off it like a crow.  The stone was\r\nerected by the vicar and two other gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\n8.--Miss Vandenhoff, tragic actress, from Drury Lane and Haymarket\r\nTheatres, commenced an engagement at Norwich Theatre, in her play,\r\n\"Woman's Heart.\"  She also appeared in \"Love's Sacrifice,\" \"Ingomar,\"\r\n\"Macbeth,\" and \"The Stranger.\"\r\n\r\n22.--In the House of Lords, Lord Sondes presented a petition from the\r\nTown Council and certain magistrates of Yarmouth, praying for an inquiry\r\ninto a recent appointment of justices for that borough.  It was stated\r\nthat the magistrates were constant in their attendance upon the Bench,\r\nand were sufficiently numerous.  The borough contained 31,000\r\ninhabitants, there were 31 magistrates, and 31 policemen.  Upon the Bench\r\nevery shade of political feeling was represented, but all the\r\nnewly-appointed magistrates were of one political party.  The Mayor of\r\nYarmouth had interviewed the Lord Chancellor, and his lordship had\r\nintimated that it was his intention to persist in the appointment, and,\r\nmoreover, he felt it his duty to appoint new magistrates of one\r\nparticular party.  The action of the Lord Chancellor had excited much\r\nfeeling in the borough.  Lord Cranworth now informed the House that he\r\nfelt bound to put the magistracy in a position in which justice should\r\nnot be partially administered, and if an inquiry were instituted it\r\nshould have his entire concurrence.  No further action resulted.\r\n\r\n23.--At a special meeting of the Norwich Town Council, a resolution was\r\nadopted expressing surprise and indignation that a covert attempt had\r\nbeen made to pervert the Grammar School and the Commercial School\r\nproposed to be established into exclusive institutions, which would not\r\nonly deprive a large proportion of the inhabitants of the advantage of\r\nthe schools, but would condemn them in public estimation, and tend to the\r\nfrustration and utter subversion of the proposed scheme.  The Charity\r\nTrustees were requested to resist this proceeding, to ascertain at whose\r\ninstance the suggestion was made, and to consider whether recent\r\ncomplaints did not imperatively demand that a searching inquiry should be\r\ninstituted into the conduct and management of the Grammar School.  The\r\nMaster of the Rolls, on July 17th, gave his decision upon the Grammar\r\nSchool case, which had long been before the Courts.  It was ordered that\r\ntwenty-one governors be appointed; the sum of 1,000 pounds per annum\r\nderived from land and house property was to be appropriated to the\r\nmaintenance of the Grammar School and Commercial School; the benefits of\r\nthe Grammar School were to be open to all England; and all the expenses\r\nto which the Corporation and those who represented Norwich had been put\r\nwere to be paid by the Charity Trustees.  On December 4th the NORFOLK\r\nCHRONICLE made the following remarkable statement in relation to the\r\ntreatment of boys at the Grammar School: \"We have recently been informed\r\nof a circumstance connected with the Grammar School which we could\r\nscarcely have credited but for the authority upon which we have received\r\nit.  It is that there exists in that school a form of punishment which\r\nought long since to have been unknown in a civilised country, amounting\r\nvery nearly to bodily torture.  We have been assured that for offences of\r\na not very serious character boys are placed for hours between shelves so\r\nconstructed that they cannot stand upright, but are obliged to stoop\r\nuntil the head is brought nearly level with the knees.\"  At a meeting of\r\nthe Governors of the School, on December 8th, it was resolved, \"That in\r\nconsequence of the informant declining to come to the Governors and\r\nsubstantiate the charge referred to in the CHRONICLE newspaper of last\r\nSaturday, we proceed no further in the matter; but that we intimate to\r\nDr. Vincent that we strongly disapprove of the mode of punishment alluded\r\nto in that newspaper, and if it has been practised, we request it may be\r\ndiscontinued.\"  The accusation was not denied, either by Dr. Vincent or\r\nby anyone on his behalf.  On December 27th Dr. Vincent resigned his\r\nappointment as headmaster.\r\n\r\n25.--Died at Hempnall, John Holmes, aged 104.  \"The deceased leaves\r\nbehind him a son, Thomas, aged 87 years, and a grandson, aged 60 years,\r\nthe latter himself being a great-grandfather, thus presenting the\r\nremarkable fact of a man living to witness the sixth generation, and to\r\nsee his great-grandson become a grandfather.\"\r\n\r\n30.--The first annual dinner of the Norfolk and Norwich Anglers' Society\r\nwas held at the Bell Hotel, Norwich, under the presidency of Mr. R. N.\r\nBacon.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--Mr. R. Rising, of Costessey, rode his horse for a wager over nine\r\nconsecutive single hurdles set up in the centre of a field.  \"This was\r\nperformed in excellent style, coming back also over the same ground, and\r\nnot refusing one.  The spectators were rather astonished to see Mr.\r\nRising repeat the feat with cap in hand.  The judge of the bet, one of\r\nthe first riders in the Norfolk Hunt, asked permission to ride the horse\r\nhimself, saying he had ridden many good horses, but never one that would\r\ntake a single hurdle.  Upon Mr. Rising consenting, he rode the same\r\nround, thus making the animal in all leap 54 single hurdles.\"\r\n\r\n11.--Died, in his 82nd year, Mr. John Venning, of Surrey House, Norwich.\r\nA native of Totnos, Devonshire, he spent several years in Russia, as the\r\nrepresentative of a firm of merchants.  He became a member of the church\r\nat which the Rev. R. Knill officiated in St. Petersburg, and devoted his\r\ntime and means to improving the wretched condition of the neglected and\r\ndepraved populace of the Russian metropolis.  He founded a school on the\r\nLancasterian system for poor Russian children, a free school for the\r\nchildren of foreigners, a refuge for the reception and care of the\r\nhelpless and destitute, a lunatic asylum in which the best modes of\r\ntreatment were introduced, the Litofsky prison, constructed to admit of\r\nthe classification and separation of prisoners; and he remodelled the\r\ngreat hospital for the reception of invalids.  Mr. Venning gained the\r\nesteem of the Emperors Alexander and Nicholas, and the hearty\r\nco-operation of the Empress Dowager, as well as of other members of the\r\nImperial family.  Through his instrumentality all exiles starting for\r\nSiberia were furnished with copies of the Scriptures.  When the\r\ndestructive inundation of November, 1824, overwhelmed the city with the\r\nwaters of the Neva, the Grand Duke Michael sent General Politica with\r\n20,000 roubles to Mr. Venning to distribute among the suffering populace.\r\n\"Throughout his long life Mr. Venning was a conscientious Dissenter--an\r\nIndependent--but he saw without regret his nearest and dearest relations\r\nstaunch members of the Church of England.\"  He married a daughter of Mr.\r\nMeybohm, of St. Petersburg, by whom he was survived.\r\n\r\n22.--St. John's church, Yarmouth, erected at the estimated cost of 1,700\r\npounds, was consecrated by the Bishop of Norwich.\r\n\r\n24.--Died, in his 77th year, Mr. Thomas Osborn Springfield, one of the\r\nmagistrates of Norwich, and head of the firm of Springfield, Son, and\r\nNephew, of St. Mary's, Norwich, and Coleman Street, London.  Born in a\r\ncomparatively humble sphere, he rose from the position of a small\r\ntradesman to a large silk merchant, \"and during his career won and lost\r\nseveral fortunes, in consequence of the fluctuations of the silk\r\nmarkets.\"  His business career ended prosperously.  He took an active\r\npart in all local matters, from the election of a parish beadle to that\r\nof a member of Parliament, ranging himself on the side called Radical.\r\nAs he himself avowed, whenever he engaged in a contest he went in to win,\r\nand many of his victories were, doubtless, most costly.  In 1827 he was\r\nelected one of the Sheriffs, and in 1829 Mayor of the city.  After the\r\npassing of the Municipal Reform Act, he was, in 1836, selected to be the\r\nfirst Chief Magistrate under the new order of things.  With a majority of\r\none only of elected councillors, the Liberals were able to add sixteen\r\naldermen to their number.  This power they then exercised to the fullest\r\nextent, selecting men of their own party only, a one-sided system which\r\nwas pursued without a break to the day of Mr. Springfield's death.  In\r\n1852 he was solicited by requisition to become a candidate for the\r\nrepresentation of the city, and if he had been inclined to accede there\r\nis little doubt that he would have secured his election.  In private life\r\nMr. Springfield exhibited many good traits; he was never unamiable nor\r\nungenerous, and there were not a few persons in the city who could trace\r\ntheir first advancement in life to his assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--The action in relation to the East Dereham Corn Exchange came before\r\nthe Vice-Chancellor's Court.  An order was made upon the Corn Exchange\r\nCompany to pay the costs of the suit, except so far as they were incurred\r\nby the inquiries raised as to the user of the site occupied by the Corn\r\nExchange, for the purpose of fairs and markets, and that they also pay\r\nthe costs of the proceedings by way of indictment on the several counts\r\nupon which a verdict had been found for the Crown.  The case was then\r\nordered to stand over until after the Trinity term, for the consideration\r\nof the Attorney-General as to what further decree or order, if any, he\r\nmight think right to apply for.  The Vice-Chancellor declined to order\r\nthe building to be pulled down as asked for by the relators, because it\r\nwas a great public improvement.  On June 26th the final decision was\r\nannounced, namely, that upon payment by the proprietors of the new Corn\r\nExchange of the costs awarded by the Court of Chancery and of 100 pounds\r\nto the East Dereham Corn Market Company, the suit would be withdrawn, and\r\nin case of any indictment laid a _nolle prosequi_ be entered.  \"These\r\nproceedings are, therefore, terminated.  The hall is to remain, and the\r\npayment for admission will continue as heretofore.\"  (_See_ February\r\n16th, 1866.)\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--Mountjoy the pedestrian, then in his 58th year, started from Lynn to\r\nWisbech for his task of walking sixty-seven miles a day for four\r\nsuccessive days.  On August 16th he began a walk from Norwich to Dereham\r\nand back twice every day, but on the 17th was stopped on his way to\r\nNorwich, by order of the magistrates, because of the obstruction caused\r\nby the number of persons who assembled on the roads in the vicinity of\r\nthe city.  Mountjoy was apprehended in Norwich on September 11th, for\r\nleaving his wife and family chargeable to the funds of the St. Pancras\r\nUnion; and on the same night attempted to commit suicide in his cell at\r\nthe Guildhall by strangling himself with a pockethandkerchief.\r\n\r\n11.--Died at Colne House, Cromer, aged 46, Sir Edward North Buxton,\r\nBart., M.P.

He succeeded to the title on the death of his father,\r\nin 1845.  From 1847 to 1852 he represented South Essex in Parliament, and\r\nin 1857 was returned unopposed with General Windham as member for East\r\nNorfolk.

Hoffman, who had already visited Norwich as the\r\nmanager of an \"organophonic\" band, announced himself as the\r\nrepresentative of \"the Society for the Promotion of Public\r\nAmusements\"--an entirely fictitious organization.  Business was suspended\r\nin Norwich, the railway companies ran excursion trains, and the streets\r\nwere thronged by many thousands of persons anxious to witness the \"grand\r\nMiddle-age pageant.\"  This consisted of a procession of between thirty\r\nand forty persons on foot and one horseman.  It was everywhere received\r\nwith groans and hisses.  Ten thousand persons were present on the Cricket\r\nGround to witness the \"Old English Sports\"; every item in the programme\r\nresulted in failure, and a _bal champetre_ was described as \"a\r\ndisgraceful affair, which ended in indiscriminate fighting among the\r\nblackguards on the ground.\"  For many years afterwards this \"_fete_\" was\r\npopularly known in Norwich as \"Hoffman's Humbug.\"\r\n\r\n7.--The headquarters of the 15th Hussars marched from Norwich, and were\r\nreplaced, on Sept. 11th, by a detachment of Royal Horse Artillery, under\r\nthe command of Major Brandling, C.B.\r\n\r\n30.--A cricket match, Norfolk and Norwich _v._ Oxford and Cambridge\r\nUniversities, was played on the Norwich ground.

Spelman, at the\r\nNorfolk Hotel, Norwich, for 6,035 pounds.\r\n\r\n7.*--\"The date of the present harvest will be remembered as the year in\r\nwhich reaping machines were fully established in Norfolk.  It was only\r\nlast year that they were introduced, for although there had been one or\r\ntwo in the county previously, they were not of the right sort, and it was\r\nnot until M'Cormick's reaper, as now made by Burgess and Key, that their\r\nnumber increased or their merits were appreciated by Norfolk farmers.\r\nThe fact that the chief part of the Hussey machines, with their back\r\ndelivery, have been returned or laid aside, and that on most large farms\r\nthere was _one_ of Burgess and Key's last year there are two this\r\nharvest, will at once point out which machine is best adapted to Norfolk\r\nagriculture.\"\r\n\r\n16.--Died at Oulton Hall, Suffolk, Ann Borrow, widow of Captain Thomas\r\nBorrow, aged 87.\r\n\r\n18.--Violent thunderstorms occurred in various parts of the county.

A house was burnt down at Kenninghall, and horses were killed by\r\nlightning at Holt.\r\n\r\n20.--Died at Woodbridge, Mr. David Fisher, aged 70.  \"He was a highly\r\ntalented and respectable public character, and had resided at Woodbridge\r\nsince his retirement from the stage twenty years previously.  He belonged\r\nto a class much more numerous half a century since than at the present\r\nday.  He was not only an actor, as nine-tenths of those who now strut\r\ntheir hour upon the stage are, by _profession_, but by intuition.  Mr.\r\nFisher was blessed with very rare histrionic and musical attainments.\r\nWhen he appeared at Drury Lane, as the contemporary and rival of Edmund\r\nKean, it was felt to be the nearest approximation then or since seen to\r\nthe overtowering abilities of that great dramatic luminary.  Mr. Fisher,\r\nhis father and family, made greater efforts than any other family ever\r\ndid to establish and cultivate in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk a\r\ntaste for the drama, at a time when this amusement was more calculated to\r\nserve the highest office of the stage than in the present degenerate\r\ndays.  Mr. Fisher built himself theatres at Bungay, Beccles, Halesworth,\r\nWells, North Walsham, Dereham, Lowestoft, Eye, and other towns, entirely\r\nat his own cost.  He generally used to feel his way by sending a company\r\nin advance for a few seasons, who located themselves in such buildings as\r\nwere available for their temporary purposes, and then, having whetted the\r\nappetites of the dwellers in rural districts for one of the most\r\nintellectual of all amusements, he summoned up courage to build a\r\ntheatre, generally one of the best structures in the town.  For very many\r\nyears these speculations proved remunerative, even though the season did\r\nnot last more than two or three months, and at intervals generally of two\r\nyears.  It is rarely that a good actor makes a good manager, but Mr.\r\nFisher was an honourable exception to this rule--indeed, it was difficult\r\nto say what department this distinguished gentleman could not fill, and\r\nfill well, too.  He was a first-rate musician, and for a considerable\r\ntime was leader at our choral concerts, and occupied a good position at\r\nour first and early Festivals.  So versatile was his genius that he has\r\nbeen known to play in the overture, then to appear in almost every act of\r\nthe tragedy of 'Hamlet,' and subsequently re-appear as Dr. O'Toole in the\r\nfarce of 'The Irish Tutor.'  He was also an admirable scene painter.\r\nDuring the latter years of his management he was much assisted by his two\r\nbrothers, Charles and George.  Finding that the palmy days of the drama\r\nwere fast fading away, Mr. Fisher retired from public life when about 50\r\nyears of age, and before all the little reserve fund he had accumulated\r\nwas too much wasted to enjoy the evening of life in a quiet and\r\nunostentatious privacy.  He was very much esteemed where he lived and\r\ndied.\"\r\n\r\n24.--The Thorpe Grove estate, formerly the property of Mr. George Harvey,\r\ndeceased, was sold for 11,390 pounds, about 2,000 pounds in excess of the\r\nvaluation sent in previous to the auction.\r\n\r\n25.--Died at his residence, Crown Point, Norwich, Lieut.-General Money,\r\nC.B., K.C., Colonel of the 2nd Regiment of Dragoons.

He served twenty-five years in the 11th Dragoons, and was in\r\nFlanders and Holland in 1794-95, and in the latter year saw service in\r\nGermany.  He took part in the attack on the French lines, was present at\r\ntheir defeats on the heights of Cateau and near Tournay, and was at the\r\nbattles of Roubaix, Launey, and other engagements.  Under Sir Ralph\r\nAbercromby, he commanded a detachment of his regiment at Leghorn,\r\nMinorca, at the expedition to Cadiz in 1800, in Egypt in 1801, and was at\r\nthe capture of Grand Cairo and Alexandria.  In the Peninsula campaigns of\r\n1811 and 1812 he was present at the siege of Badajoz, the battle of\r\nSalamanca, and the affair of cavalry near the Tormes on the following\r\nday, when three French battalions were taken.  He was at the cavalry\r\naffairs of Callada Camino and Fenta de Poso.  He served also in the\r\ncampaign of 1815, and was at the battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo;\r\ntowards the close of the latter the command of the 11th Dragoons devolved\r\nupon him.  General Money married, in 1841, Lady Annetta Laura Maria\r\nWaldegrave, daughter of the sixth Earl of Waldegrave.

His voice\r\nwas far from powerful, but he had remarkable expression and the power of\r\nexhibiting this in face as well as in voice.  As a pecuniary speculation,\r\nit must have been highly profitable to Mr. Dickens.\"\r\n\r\n17.--The town of Attleborough was, for the first time, lighted with gas,\r\nan event which was celebrated by a public dinner at the New Inn.\r\n\r\n20.--At the Norwich Quarter Sessions, John Plummer (25), shoemaker, was\r\nindicted for stealing a model of a gold nugget, the property of the\r\ntrustees of the Norfolk and Norwich Museum.

Valentine\r\nhaving been tried and convicted at the Quarter Sessions, the Town Clerk\r\nhad stated that the city was entitled to the convict's money.  The Chief\r\nConstable wished to know how he should dispose of the money.  The\r\nCommittee were advised that, after the conviction, the city had become\r\nentitled to the money under a Royal charter granted during the reign of\r\nHenry IV.  The Council ordered that the money remain in the hands of the\r\nCity Treasurer, pending further inquiry.  The question was again\r\nconsidered by the Council on May 12th, 1863, when the Town Clerk reported\r\nthat after Valentine's conviction it was found that, in addition to the\r\nsum in question (90 pounds), he had 60 pounds deposited in a savings bank\r\nin London.  The Town Clerk had given notice to the bank directors that\r\nthe Corporation claimed the money, but since the liberation of the\r\nprisoner he had been pressed to withdraw the notices, and had refused to\r\ndo so without the sanction of the Corporation.  The difficulty under\r\nwhich the Corporation laboured was that the money was out of their\r\njurisdiction, and they had no control over it beyond the notice that had\r\nbeen given.  If further steps were taken the question would arise whether\r\nit was a forfeiture to the Corporation or to the Crown, but as this would\r\ninvolve an inquisition, the cost of which would probably exhaust the\r\nmoney enquired about, it was for the Council to say whether, the man,\r\nhaving served his term of three years' penal servitude, and having\r\npetitioned for some relief from the fund to place him in a position to\r\ngain an honest livelihood, they would authorise the withdrawal of the\r\nnotice.  It was agreed that the notice be withdrawn.\r\n\r\n25.--A severe storm occurred off the Norfolk coast.  At Winterton two\r\nvessels were wrecked and thirteen lives lost.  At Yarmouth there were\r\nseveral wrecks, and for miles the shore was strewn with remains of\r\ncargoes and portions of vessels.

H. Tillett was\r\nelected Mayor, and Mr. Joseph Underwood appointed Sheriff.\r\n\r\n--Mr. Tillett, on taking his seat as Mayor of Norwich, informed the Town\r\nCouncil that an attempt had been made to bribe one of the Councillors.\r\nMr. Joel Fox, the member in question, produced the halves of three 100\r\npounds bank notes, which, he alleged, the Conservatives had handed to him\r\nto induce him to vote for eight Conservative Aldermen.  After the vote\r\nhad been recorded the payment was to be completed.  Amid much excitement,\r\na Special Committee was appointed to investigate the case.  On November\r\n12th, before the Committee had presented their report, criminal\r\nproceedings were instituted against Mr. Albert John Collins, solicitor, a\r\nmember of the firm of Beckwith and Collins, who was charged at the Police\r\nCourt with conspiring with Henry Croxford, stationer and others, to bribe\r\nJoel Fox, Town Councillor, by promising and offering him a sum of money\r\nto vote for certain Aldermen.  Croxford, the other defendant, had\r\nabsconded.  Fox alleged that he went to Croxford's house, where he was\r\nshown the halves of three 100 pounds notes and four 50 pounds notes,\r\nwhich were offered to him by Croxford, on behalf of Collins, on condition\r\nthat he voted for the Conservative Aldermen.  After formal evidence, the\r\ncase was adjourned.  On the 16th the Committee of the Council asked for\r\nfull power and authority to proceed with the investigation, and to take\r\nsuch steps as might be necessary for the prosecution of the offenders.\r\nThe Council granted the application.  The magisterial proceedings were\r\nresumed on the 17th, when Mr. Power, Q.C. (instructed by the Town Clerk,\r\nMr. Mendham), appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Serjeant Ballantine\r\nfor the defendant Collins.  After further evidence had been taken, the\r\ncase was again adjourned.  Meanwhile informations had been laid against\r\nWilliam Wilde, William Wilde, the younger, William George Wilde, James\r\nStowers, and Sir William Foster, members of the Liberal party, for\r\nconspiring to bribe at the last General Election for the city.

A special\r\nmeeting of the Town Council was held on December 6th, to consider the\r\nfollowing motion by Mr. Simms Reeve: \"That it is the opinion of this\r\nCouncil that the peace and welfare of the city will be best promoted by\r\nthe cessation of political strife, and, with the view to the attainment\r\nof that object, the resolution of the Council of the 16th November last,\r\nwith reference to the charge of bribery made by Mr. Councillor Fox, be\r\ncancelled, and that all further legal proceedings against Henry Croxford\r\nand Albert John Collins and others for conspiracy be stayed.\"  The motion\r\nwas seconded by Mr. Field.  Mr. C. M. Gibson moved, as an amendment,\r\n\"That the due administration of justice is essential to the peace and\r\nwelfare of the city, and it is therefore the opinion of the Council that\r\nthe resolution of the 16th November . . . should be again confirmed.\"\r\nThe motion was carried by 28 votes against 19.  On December 8th, when the\r\nmagisterial proceedings were resumed, the Town Clerk said he had no\r\ninstructions from the Town Council to proceed with the prosecution.\r\nAfter he had formally withdrawn, Mr. R.

Holland, and Mr. John Pymar appeared as\r\nprosecutors, and Mr. Power claimed to be heard as their counsel.  The\r\nBench decided that there was no _prima facie_ case against Collins, who\r\nwas discharged on giving sureties to answer any charge that might be made\r\nagainst him at the Assizes.  Serjeant Ballantine thereupon said that he\r\nwould offer no evidence in the charges against the Messrs. Wilde, and Mr.\r\nS. H. Asker, who appeared for the complainant Lacey, withdrew the summons\r\nissued on his information.\r\n\r\n12.--Mr. Louth, landlord of the Rampant Horse Hotel, Norwich, received\r\nfatal injuries by the overturning of his vehicle in London Street.

At the adjourned inquest, on\r\nDecember 15th, the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, with the\r\nrider: \"They consider, from the evidence of eminent architects of London\r\nand builders of Norwich, that the buildings are in an unsafe condition,\r\nand require the immediate attention of the Corporation, in order to\r\ninsure the perfect safety of the public.\"\r\n\r\n10.--Died at Sydenham, Col. the Hon.

He was son of Sir Jacob Henry Astley, fifth\r\nbaronet, by the youngest daughter and co-heiress of Samuel Browne, of\r\nKing's Lynn.  His lordship was born in 1797, married in March, 1819, the\r\nyoungest daughter of Sir Henry Watkin Dashwood, Bart., and succeeded his\r\nfather in the baronetcy in 1817.  As one of the heirs of Sir John de\r\nHastings, who sat in the Parliament of 18th Edward I., he was summoned to\r\nthe House of Peers in 1841.  He was appointed first Captain and\r\nCommandant of the Norfolk Militia Artillery in 1853, and Hon. Colonel in\r\n1856.  From 1832 to 1837 he represented West Norfolk in Parliament.

The Chairman (Sir Willoughby Jones) remarked that theoretically\r\nthe javelin men kept the Courts, but practically they kept the\r\nneighbouring public-houses.  The recommendation was agreed to.  On March\r\n27th, Mr. Justice Williams was received at Victoria Station by the High\r\nSheriff (Mr. Henry Birkbeck) and a posse of policemen, \"in the place of\r\nthe time-honoured body which had long constituted a conspicuous part of\r\nthe pomp and circumstance of our Assizes, having at length succumbed to\r\nthe utilitarian tyranny of the age.  His arrival at the Shirehall and\r\nGuildhall was signalised, however, by the customary fanfaronade on a\r\ncouple of inharmonious trumpets.\"\r\n\r\n15.--St. Giles' church, Norwich, was for the first time lighted with gas,\r\nand evening services were held there from this date.\r\n\r\n17.--Mr. E.

C. Aberdein, pastry cook,\r\nDove Street, Norwich.  The outbreak itself was not of a serious\r\ncharacter, but in a room upon the adjoining premises of Mr. Cubitt,\r\nironmonger, was stored upwards of 400 lbs. of gunpowder, which was safely\r\nremoved in wet blankets.  The circumstance caused much sensation, and the\r\npracticability of establishing a public powder magazine was discussed by\r\nthe magistrates.\r\n\r\n20.--Died at King's Lynn, Mr. J. F. Reddie, many years organist at St.\r\nMargaret's church, in that town.\r\n\r\n24.--A petition against the return of Sir Edmund Lacon and Sir H.\r\nStracey, as members of Parliament for Great Yarmouth, in April, 1859,\r\ncommenced before a Special Committee of the House of Commons.  The\r\npetitioners, Mr. Joseph Bayly, surgeon, and Mr. Robert Pilgrim, linen\r\ndraper, alleged bribery, undue influence, treating, and intimidation.  On\r\nMarch 1st the Committee declared the members to have been duly elected,\r\nand were of opinion that one of the witnesses, Henry Fayerman, had been\r\nguilty of wilful and corrupt perjury.  The members were received with\r\ngreat enthusiasm on their return to Yarmouth, and were entertained at a\r\npublic dinner, given at the Theatre, on April 12th.  At the Westminster\r\nPolice Court, on June 11th, Fayerman was committed for trial on the\r\ncharge of perjury, but at the Old Bailey, on July 12th, the jury gave a\r\nverdict of acquittal.\r\n\r\n28.--A terrible gale raged throughout the country.  At Norwich, between\r\nten o'clock and noon, the thermometer rose from 36 degrees to 47 degrees;\r\nat two o'clock it registered 45 degrees.  The wind blew from the west,\r\nveering occasionally to the north and to W.N.W., but during the height of\r\nthe gale it blew west by north.  Great damage was done to buildings,\r\ntrees were uprooted, and \"locomotion was extremely difficult and\r\nlaborious, and, indeed, quite out of the question to those of the fair\r\nsex whose fashionable expanded dresses, assuming the properties of\r\nparachutes, compelled them to undertake a species of aerial voyage for a\r\ndistance of a few yards, or exposed them to the still more unpleasant\r\npredicament of having their parachute garments inverted.\"  There were\r\nmany disasters along the coast, and several lives were lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.--A Special Committee of the House of Commons sat to decide various\r\nquestions arising out of the elections at Norwich in 1859.  The first\r\npoint to be decided was whether Lord Bury's claim, by virtue of the\r\nelection in July, was not nullified by the bribery which was proved to\r\nhave been made by his agents when he was returned with Mr. Schneider in\r\nApril; and secondly, whether, in the event of such disqualification, Sir\r\nSamuel Bignold or Colonel Boldero had a valid claim.  There were three\r\npetitions: (1) against the return of Lord Bury and the qualification of\r\nSir Samuel Bignold, on the ground that both had been guilty of bribery at\r\nthe April election, and the seat was, therefore, claimed for Colonel\r\nBoldero (signed by Josiah Fletcher, S. Jarrold, and J. J. Kempster); (2)\r\nalleging the disqualification of Lord Bury, and claiming the seat for Sir\r\nSamuel Bignold (signed by J. G. Johnson and R. Kerrison); and (3)\r\nalleging the disqualification of both Lord Bury and Sir Samuel Bignold,\r\nand claiming the seat for Colonel Boldero (signed by P. Back and G. C.\r\nStevens).  No appearance was put in in support of the first petition.\r\nThe Committee declared that Lord Bury was not merely disqualified from\r\nsitting in the House of Commons during the then Parliament, but the last\r\nelection was void, in consequence of his lordship having been found,\r\nsince that return, guilty of bribery by his agents.  A writ was then\r\nissued for another election, and on March 28th the following candidates\r\nwere nominated: Mr. W. Forlonge (C), Aynhoe Park, Northamptonshire; Mr.\r\nW. D. Lewis, Q.C. (C); Sir William Russell (L), and Mr. Edward Warner\r\n(L).  The polling took place on the 29th, and the result was officially\r\ndeclared on the 30th, as follows: Warner, 2,083; Russell, 2,045;\r\nForlonge, 1,636; Lewis, 1,631.\r\n\r\n24.--Died at his residence, Hillington Hall, aged 73, Sir William John\r\nHenry Browne ffolkes, Bart.  He represented the county, and afterwards\r\nthe Western Division, as a supporter of Liberal principles from 1830\r\nthrough the Reform era, but lost the seat on the redaction of the\r\nConservative party in 1837, when Mr. Bagge and Mr. Chute were returned.\r\nAs a magistrate, country gentleman, and landlord, Sir William was highly\r\nesteemed.  He was Chairman of Quarter Sessions at Swaffham, and chairman\r\nof the Norfolk Estuary Company.  He was succeeded by his grandson,\r\nWilliam Howell, then in his twelfth year, and eldest son of Martin Brown\r\nffolkes, who was killed by lightning in July, 1849.\r\n\r\n24.--The Rev. J. W. L. Heaviside was installed Canon of Norwich\r\nCathedral, in succession to Canon Wodehouse, resigned.  Mr. Heaviside was\r\na professor at Haileybury College, an examiner in mathematics for the\r\nUniversity of London and for the Council of Military Education, and a\r\nbrother of Mr. Heaviside, formerly master of the Norwich School of Art.\r\n\r\n29.--At the Norwich Assizes, before Lord Chief Justice Cockburn and a\r\nspecial jury, was tried a libel action, in which Mr. Samuel B. Cory,\r\nsolicitor, Yarmouth, was the plaintiff, and Mr. T. W. Bond, publisher of\r\nthe \"Norfolk News,\" Norwich, the defendant.  The libel was contained in a\r\nletter written to the newspaper by a Mr. Fabb, who alleged, among other\r\nthings, that Mr. Cory had laid informations in certain game cases, with\r\nthe object of putting the fees into his own pocket.  Mr. Fabb, it was\r\nunderstood, had indemnified the \"Norfolk News.\"  The jury returned a\r\nverdict for the plaintiff, with one farthing damages, as to that part of\r\nthe libel above quoted, and for the defendant as to other portions of the\r\nlibel, on the ground that they had been justified as true.  The effect of\r\nthe verdict was that plaintiff had to pay his own costs and half the\r\ncosts of the defendant.  In a second action, Mr. Fabb sued Mr. Cory for\r\nmalicious prosecution, and obtained a verdict for 30 pounds damages.\r\n\r\n30.--Died, in her 63rd year, at Cheltenham, while on a visit to her\r\nson-in-law, the Rev. J. F. Fenn, Lady Bignold, wife of Sir Samuel\r\nBignold.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--An important will case, Wright _v._ Wilkin, commenced at the Norfolk\r\nAssizes, before Lord Chief Justice Cockburn and a special jury.  It was\r\nbrought in the form of an action for ejectment to recover possession of\r\ncertain tenements and lands held by the defendant, Thomas Martin Wilkin,\r\nsolicitor, of Lynn, under the will of an old lady named Mary Mann.  The\r\nplaintiff, who was heir-at-law, alleged that the will was obtained from\r\nan infirm and weak-minded person by fraudulent practices and\r\ncontrivances.  The will had already been disputed, and in that trial a\r\nverdict was given in favour of Mr. Wilkin; this action was brought\r\nbecause there had come to the knowledge of the plaintiff facts and\r\ncircumstances which had been entirely withheld from the former jury.  The\r\ntrial lasted until the afternoon of the 3rd, when the jury found for the\r\ndefendant, subject to argument upon certain points reserved.  These were\r\nstated in the Court of Queen's Bench on April 9th, and were to the effect\r\nthat the devise to the defendant was defeated by his neglect to comply\r\nwith a condition of the will, namely, that the devise was conditional on\r\nthe devisee paying off certain legacies within twelvemonths in case the\r\npersonal estate should be insufficient for that purpose.  It transpired\r\nthat the personal estate was insufficient, but the defendant did not pay\r\none of the legacies within the time stipulated.  It was also contended\r\nfor the plaintiff that the devise to the defendant was void, inasmuch as\r\nit was a contrivance to defeat the Statute of Mortmain, several of the\r\nlegacies being for charitable purposes, and that the defendant had misled\r\nthe testatrix by not telling her that, under 43rd George III., she could\r\nleave as much as five acres of land for the repair of the church.  Lord\r\nChief Justice Cockburn granted a rule _nisi_.  In the Court of Queen's\r\nBench, on November 27th, the Lord Chief Justice said the rule must be\r\ndischarged, as the words in the will were not intended to impose a\r\ncondition, the non-observance of which would involve forfeiture.  Mr.\r\nJustice Crompton and Mr. Justice Blackburn concurred.  The rule was\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n24.--The Queen's birthday was celebrated at Norwich by a parade on\r\nMousehold of the Royal Horse Artillery, the West Norfolk Militia, and the\r\nRifle Volunteers.  The Mayor afterwards entertained the officers at\r\nluncheon at the Guildhall, and in the evening the Volunteers dined at St.\r\nAndrew's Hall, under the presidency of Major Brett.\r\n\r\n28.--A violent gale from the north-west did extensive damage in Norwich\r\nand throughout the county.  Terrible disasters were reported on the\r\ncoast.  Twenty vessels belonging to Yarmouth and Lowestoft were lost, 200\r\nmen and boys perished, and 240 women and children were left in a state of\r\ndestitution.  On the 29th an inquiry was held at Yarmouth into certain\r\nallegations as to the conduct of the beachmen and crew of the lifeboat.\r\nIt was stated that, in consequence of differences which had arisen, much\r\nvaluable time was lost in launching the lifeboat, and a resolution\r\nexpressing regret at the delay was adopted.  A public fund was raised for\r\nthe destitute families of the local fishermen.  During the gale, the\r\nnorth-east pinnacle of St. Peter's church, Yarmouth, was dislodged, the\r\nwindows of Cromer church were blown in, and at Blickling 247 oaks were\r\nuprooted in the Great Wood, 216 in Hercules Wood, and 190 in other\r\nportions of the park.  It was estimated that 1,500 trees were levelled on\r\nthe estate.\r\n\r\n--The American horse tamer, Rarey, gave an exhibition of his system of\r\ntraining, in the riding school at the Cavalry Barracks, Norwich.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--The Royal Horse Artillery marched from the Cavalry Barracks, Norwich,\r\n_en route_ to Woolwich, and were escorted to the city boundary by the\r\nRifle Volunteers.\r\n\r\n9.--An extraordinary case, arising out of the sudden disappearance of a\r\nlad named Vansittart, came before the Norwich magistrates.  The lad was a\r\nson of Mr. Vansittart, member of Parliament for Windsor, and had been\r\nplaced at school under the care of the Rev. F. H. S. Hodgson, rector of\r\nRackheath.  At Brighton, some time previously, he had developed Roman\r\nCatholic tendencies, and his friends were anxious to remove him from the\r\nsphere of such influences.  Mr. Hodgson, while engaged in parochial\r\nduties, missed the youth, and gave information to the police at Norwich,\r\nwho found him at the house of a Roman Catholic jeweller, named Beha.  The\r\nlad made a very singular statement, to the effect that an Italian priest,\r\nattired in a long blue cloak, had persuaded him to leave school and join\r\nthe Roman Catholics in London; that he had gone to Norwich and met Canon\r\nDalton, the priest at St. John Maddermarket Roman Catholic chapel, to\r\nwhom he had shown a watch belonging to a school-fellow; that Canon Dalton\r\nhad advanced him six shillings, and recommended him to take the watch to\r\nBeha, for the purpose of raising sufficient money to pay the balance of\r\nhis railway fare to London; and that he was preparing to start for town\r\nwhen he was detained by the police.  Canon Dalton declared that he had\r\nnot seen the lad prior to his coming to St. John Maddermarket.  The\r\nmatter was adjourned for further inquiry, and on the 11th Canon Dalton,\r\nJacob Beha, Matthew Beha, and Thomas Foulsham were required to attend\r\nbefore the magistrates, when the proceedings were deferred until the\r\n18th, the persons named protesting against the course adopted by the\r\nBench, and urging that no charge had at present been preferred against\r\nthem.  Another adjournment took place until the 25th, when Mr. Serjeant\r\nBallantine appeared for the prosecution, and preferred a charge of\r\nconspiracy against Canon Dalton and the Behas.  The boy Vansittart gave\r\nevidence, and, in cross-examination by Mr. Woollett, counsel for the\r\ndefence, admitted that he had told \"a tissue of lies,\" and that the main\r\npoints of his story were entirely invented by himself.  The magistrates\r\ndismissed the case, but expressed the opinion that the conduct of Canon\r\nDalton was exceedingly reprehensible in not advising the lad to return to\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\n18.--Died at his residence, at Thorpe, General Sir Robert J. Harvey,\r\nC.B., K.T.S., Knight Commander of the Order of St. Bento d'Avis, F.R.S.,\r\nF.A.S.  Sir Robert, who was in his 75th year, saw much active service\r\nduring his military career.  He was present at the battles of the Douro\r\nand Busaco, the battle of Salamanca, the siege of Burgos, and at\r\nVittoria, the Pyrenees (where he was wounded in the thigh by a musket\r\nshot), Nivelle, Nive, Orthes, and Toulouse.  The long-protracted war\r\nhaving been brought to a close in 1815 by the crowning victory at\r\nWaterloo, on the anniversary of which he died, he returned to Norwich and\r\nbecame an acting partner in the bank of Harveys and Hudson, and was head\r\nof the firm at the time of his death.  He was a magistrate and a Deputy\r\nLieutenant of Norfolk, president of the Norwich Union Life Office and the\r\nNorwich Union Fire Insurance Society, chairman of the General\r\nReversionary Interest Society in London, and founder of several other\r\nimportant institutions of a kindred character.  In politics he was a\r\nConservative, but took no prominent part in local affairs.  Sir Robert\r\nmarried a daughter of Mr. Robert Harvey, of Walton, Suffolk, a distant\r\nrelative, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Mr. R. J. H. Harvey.  The\r\nwill of the deceased was proved on February 21st, 1861, when the\r\npersonalty was sworn under 350,000 pounds.  \"Mr. R. J. H. Harvey has\r\npurchased all his brother's (Mr. E. K. Harvey's) interest under the will,\r\nso that he is now in possession of the whole of the real and personal\r\nproperty of his late father, subject to Lady Harvey's life interest in\r\nthe Mousehold estates and to the annuities named in the will.\"\r\n\r\n19.--At a special meeting of the Norwich Town Council, it was agreed,\r\n\"That the Lords of the Treasury having sanctioned the sale to the New\r\nStreet Company of the property required by them belonging to the\r\nCorporation for the sum of 3,260 pounds, and having required to be\r\ninformed of the purpose to which the Corporation propose to apply such\r\npurchase-money, this Council agrees, with the sanction of the Lords of\r\nthe Treasury, to apply 2,000 pounds towards the making of the new street,\r\nwhich, on its completion, will be vested in the Corporation, and, the\r\nremaining 1,260 pounds towards the widening of the present approach to\r\nthe Cattle Market by Rose Lane.\"\r\n\r\n30.--The Channel Fleet, under the command of Admiral Sir C. Fremantle,\r\nK.C.B., arrived in Yarmouth Roads.  Since the year 1814 no two ships of\r\nthe line had been moored at the same time off Yarmouth.  The fleet\r\nconsisted of nine ships of the line, two frigates, a corvette, and a\r\ntender.  The Mayor and Corporation of the borough waited upon the Admiral\r\nand invited the officers to a ball, but orders came for the fleet to sail\r\nearly on the morning of July 2nd.\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.--Mousehold Rifle Range was used for the first time by the Norwich\r\nVolunteers.  The first prize-meeting took place on September 17th, when\r\nthere were twelve competitors from the city and twenty-four from the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\n23.--The Donegal Militia left Yarmouth.\r\n\r\n27.--At the Norfolk Assizes, before Chief Baron Pollock and a special\r\njury, an action, Gillings _v._ Manders, was tried.  The plaintiff was a\r\ncarpenter at Yarmouth, and the defendant the proprietor of a travelling\r\nmenagerie.  One of the attractions of the show was the performance of a\r\nZulu named Maccomo, who was styled a \"Lion King,\" and fired off pistols\r\nand carbines in a cage containing half a dozen lions and lionesses.  In a\r\nperformance given at Yarmouth, Maccomo, instead of firing his pistol to\r\nthe top of the cage, discharged it among the spectators, and the wad\r\nentering the plaintiff's eyes destroyed it.  Muccomo said it was the\r\nresult of an accident.  One of his lions attacked him in a fit of temper,\r\nand the trigger, catching in the beast's mane, was prematurely\r\ndischarged.  The jury found for the plaintiff, damages 150 pounds.\r\n\r\n31.--In the Norwich Episcopal Consistory Court, Mr. Chancellor Evans gave\r\njudgment in a protracted case, Archdeacon Bouverie _v._ the Rev. W. L.\r\nBarnes.  The suit was instituted by the Archdeacon of Norfolk, against\r\nthe rector of Knapton, for procurations for the years 1856-57-58-59.  The\r\nplaintiff alleged, in his libels, that he was entitled to receive from\r\nthe rector the sum of 7s. 7.5d., due at Michaelmas every year, by reason\r\nof his visiting, of his archidiaconal dignity, or by custom.  Mr. Barnes\r\nrequired the Archdeacon to prove such parts of his case as were not\r\nadmitted, and, further, he said that, supposing the case as stated in the\r\nlibels were proved, the Archdeacon was not entitled to be paid his\r\nprocurations for the years 1857-58-59, because he did not in those years\r\nhold a parochial visitation at Knapton.  The Court decreed in favour of\r\nthe Archdeacon, with costs, and Mr. Barnes gave notice that he should\r\nappeal against the judgment.  No further proceedings, however, were\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST.\r\n\r\n\r\n27.--Died at Hampstead Marshall, Newbury, Berks., the Right Hon. Louisa,\r\nDowager Countess of Craven, aged 78.  She was a daughter of Mr. John\r\nBrunton, manager of Norwich Theatre, and half a century before her death\r\nwas a favourite actress upon the Norwich and the London stage.  She\r\nmarried the Earl of Craven in 1807, and of the marriage there were three\r\nsons and a daughter.\r\n\r\n28.--The first festival of the associated choirs belonging to the Norfolk\r\nand Suffolk Church Choral Association, established in October, 1859, was\r\nhold at Norwich Cathedral.\r\n\r\n30.--Died at her residence in Kentish Town, aged 61, Elizabeth, widow of\r\nFrederick Yates, formerly of the Adelphi Theatre.  She was a daughter of\r\nJohn Brunton, the younger, of Norwich and a niece of the Dowager Countess\r\nof Craven.  She made her _debut_ at King's Lynn, in the character of\r\nDesdemona, and her first appearance in London at Covent Garden Theatre,\r\non Sept. 12th, 1817, as Letitia Hardy.  At Covent Garden she continued to\r\nplay leading high comedy until 1824, when she married Mr. Frederick\r\nYates, who died in 1842, leaving an only son, born in 1831.  After the\r\ndeath of her husband, Mrs. Yates remained at the Adelphi with Mr.\r\nWebster, played for one season at the Lyceum with Madame Vestris, and\r\nfinally retired from the stage in 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n17.--The Norfolk and Norwich Triennial Musical Festival commenced at St.\r\nAndrew's Hall, Norwich, with an evening performance of \"The Creation.\"\r\nThe morning performances were as follow: On the 19th, the \"Dettingen Te\r\nDeum\" and \"The Last Judgment\"; on the 20th, \"Abraham\" and \"As the hart\r\npants\"; and on the 21st \"The Messiah.\"  Miscellaneous programmes were\r\nperformed on the evenings of the 19th and 20th.

A \"fancy dress ball\" was announced\r\nfor the evening of the 21st.  \"Only three individuals appeared in fancy\r\ndress--costumes which, from their quality, would have far more fitted a\r\nmasquerade at the Baronial Hall than an elegant assembly like that of\r\nFriday evening.  The wearers of them evidently felt ill at ease, and,\r\nafter enduring the rather marked observation that they attracted for some\r\ntime, were glad to call a fly and take their departure.\"  The total\r\nreceipts of the Festival amounted to 5,095 pounds 16s., and the\r\ndisbursements to 4,179 pounds 12s. 1d.\r\n\r\n18.--The Earl of Leicester, as Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk, and\r\nMajor-General Wood, C.B., reviewed 1,200 Volunteers of the city and\r\ncounty on Mousehold Heath, Norwich.\r\n\r\n20.--Prince Jerome Bonaparte, with his suite, consisting of an\r\n_aide-de-camp_ and six members of the French Ministry, visited\r\nGressenhall Workhouse and made particular enquiries into the management\r\nof the institution.\r\n\r\n28.--Died at Upper Harley Street, London, in his 85th year, Mr. Charles\r\nLombe, of Great Melton.

Mrs.\r\nDady, sister of Mr. Frankland, was sitting in a room over Mr. Marrison's\r\nshop, and was dashed by the force of the explosion to the ceiling.  She\r\nfell through the chasm in the floor to the burning ruins beneath, where\r\nshe was fearfully injured.  Charles Hill, a shop boy in the employment of\r\nMr. Marrison, was killed outright, and terribly mangled.  The force of\r\nthe explosion shattered the windows of the Bell Hotel and of other houses\r\nin the vicinity.  At the Norwich Assizes on March 26th, 1861, before\r\nChief Baron Pollock, Mr. Marrison brought an action against the London\r\nUnion Fire Office, for the recovery of 300 pounds under a policy of\r\ninsurance on his stock and furniture.  The plaintiff had been offered and\r\nhad refused 100 pounds in settlement of the claim.  The company then\r\nproved that the plaintiff had kept more gunpowder on his premises than\r\nwas allowed by the terms of his contract, whereupon the judge ordered a\r\nnon-suit.\r\n\r\n3.--Died at Brighton, in his 61st year, Capt. Frederick Loftus, formerly\r\nof the 17th Lancers, youngest son of General and Lady Elizabeth Loftus,\r\nand grandson of George, first Marquis Townshend and Charlotte, Baroness\r\nDe Ferrars and Compton.

The husband sought dissolution of marriage, on the\r\nground of misconduct by the wife.  A petition had been presented for the\r\nsettlement of property then vested in the wife in favour of the children,\r\nthe issue of the marriage, and the Solicitor-General applied for a rule\r\n_nisi_ calling on the respondent, Mrs. Gurney, to show cause why a plea\r\nor a pleading in the nature of or intended to be a plea should not be\r\ntaken off the file, and why the petition for settlement should not be\r\ntreated as unanswered or unopposed.  Sir C. Cresswell granted a rule\r\n_nisi_.  Evidence was given in the case on January 22nd, 1861, and the\r\ndecree was made absolute on May 22nd.\r\n\r\n11.--In the Vice-Chancellor's Court was heard the action, Berney _v._ the\r\nNorfolk and Eastern Counties Railway Company.  By an agreement dated June\r\n6th, 1843, the plaintiff sold certain land to the Norwich and Yarmouth\r\nRailway Company, and it was provided that such company should establish\r\nand for ever maintain a station in connection with their railway at\r\nReedham, on part of the land sold to them by plaintiff.  Nothing was said\r\nin the agreement in reference to stopping trains at the station.  In 1844\r\nthe Norwich and Yarmouth railway was completed, and a station was\r\nconstructed in accordance with the agreement, and called the Barney Arms\r\nStation, at which certain trains stopped.  In 1845 the Norwich and\r\nYarmouth Company was incorporated with the Norfolk Railway Company, and\r\ntrains continued to stop at the station until 1850, when the Norfolk\r\nCompany discontinued the practice.  The plaintiff thereupon instituted\r\nthis suit, praying for a specific performance of the agreement of June,\r\n1843, and an injunction to restrain the Norfolk Company from permitting\r\nthe trains on their railway to pass the Berney Arms Station without\r\nstopping thereat, which was, in effect, to compel the company to stop the\r\ntrains at that station.  The motion for the injunction did not come on,\r\nin consequence of an arrangement whereby the Norfolk Company agreed to\r\nstop at Berney Arms Station one train from Norwich and one from Yarmouth\r\non every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday.  The Norfolk Railway was now\r\nworked by the Eastern Counties Railway on an agreement dated in 1854,\r\nwhich had received the sanction of the Legislature.  The Eastern Counties\r\nCompany were then made parties to the suit.  Although the trains then\r\nstopped in a manner satisfactory to the plaintiff, there was no security\r\nthat they would continue to do so.  The Vice-Chancellor said there must\r\nbe a specific performance of the agreement of June, 1843, and an order\r\nthat one train from Norwich and one from Yarmouth should stop at Berney\r\nArms Station on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday in every week; but he\r\nshould also order that each of the companies should pay 100 pounds to the\r\nplaintiff by way of costs.  But for the plaintiff's forbearance in this\r\nrespect, it would be difficult to say whether the Eastern Counties\r\nCompany would have escaped from the litigation with having nothing else\r\nto pay than the plaintiff's ordinary costs.\r\n\r\n14.--The Norwich Operatic Union gave its second concert, at St. Andrew's\r\nHall.  The programme included \"Norma\" and selections from \"Il Trovatore.\"\r\nThe principal vocalists were Mdlle. Paripa, Mdlle. Vaneri, Mr. Santley,\r\nand Mr. Swift.

Stephenson, Wesleyan minister.  \"The boxes\r\nwere reserved for the most respectable-looking, and the unmitigated\r\nplebs. were relegated to the pit and gallery.  The occupants of the\r\ngallery conducted themselves as the gods usually do, and were rebuked by\r\nthe preacher, who took up his position on the stage in front of the drop\r\nscene, surrounded by a number of persons of both sexes.\"\r\n\r\n25.--This was the coldest Christmas that had been experienced for at\r\nleast a century.  \"At the Literary Institute at Norwich the minimum\r\nregistered was 3 degrees above zero.  At Costessey the register was 7\r\ndegrees below zero, or 39 degrees lower than the point at which water\r\nfreezes.  A peculiarity of the temperature on Christmas-day was the fact\r\nof its being colder in the morning than during the night.  The coldest\r\nregister was between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m., and there was scarcely any\r\nappreciable variation till after two o'clock.  Ice was about four inches\r\nthick.\"\r\n\r\n26.--The pantomime at Norwich Theatre was entitled, \"Cinderella, or the\r\nLittle Glass Slipper and the Fairy Godmother from the Realms of Golden\r\nPalms.\"  Wombwell's Menagerie was stationed on the Castle Meadow, and\r\nperformances were given at the Royal Crystal Palace Amphitheatre, Golden\r\nBall Street, under the management of Messrs.

He graduated at\r\nEdinburgh, and subsequently commenced practice in London, where he\r\ngradually raised himself to the very highest branches of his profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--At the annual meeting of the Norfolk Agricultural Association, held\r\nat the Swan Hotel, Norwich, Mr. Clare Sewell Read moved that the annual\r\nshow for 1861 be held at East Dereham, instead of at Swaffham.  This\r\neffort to abolish the system of holding the exhibitions alternately at\r\nNorwich and Swaffham was defeated by 19 votes to 15.\r\n\r\n6.--The frost continued with unusual intensity, and on this day\r\nsnowstorms, which covered the ground to the depth of twelve inches,\r\noccurred.  On the 10th a public meeting was held at Norwich, under the\r\npresidency of the Mayor (Mr. W. J. Utten Browne), at which a fund was\r\ninaugurated to relieve the distresses of the poor.  In a few days the sum\r\nof 4,139 pounds 12s. 11d. was subscribed.  The river was frozen from\r\nNorwich to Yarmouth, and on the 16th a large party of ladies and\r\ngentlemen assembled on the ice on Breydon and \"skated\" quadrilles.  The\r\nfrost continued for more than five weeks, during the whole of which\r\nperiod the ground was covered with snow.\r\n\r\n11.--Walsingham Quarter Sessions were held for the last time.  Sir\r\nWilloughby Jones, who presided, informed the Grand Jury that the Sessions\r\nwould be removed part to Swaffham and part to Norwich, \"on account of the\r\nexpenses being so great in proportion to the number of prisoners for\r\ntrial.\"  On March lst the Bridewell ceased to be used as a house of\r\ncorrection, and the prisoners were removed to Norwich Castle.\r\n\r\n16.--Died, aged 85, Mr. Kinnebrook, for many years a proprietor of the\r\n\"Norwich Mercury.\"\r\n\r\n18.--Died, in his 60th year, Mr. Thomas Lound, for 35 years confidential\r\nclerk at King Street Old Brewery, Norwich.  \"As an artist, but\r\nprincipally as a painter in water-colours, he had maintained a high\r\nreputation for many years.  The local river and rural scenery afforded\r\nmaterials for a large proportion of his works.  He occasionally painted\r\nstreet scenes and monastic ruins, and of late years he made excursions\r\ninto Wales and Yorkshire, bringing home with him a vast variety of\r\nsubjects.\"  In addition to his own collection, he left many water-colour\r\ndrawings by Bright, Thirtle, Cox, and others, some of them of\r\nconsiderable value.\r\n\r\n26.--At Norwich Castle, James Blomfield Rush, aged 30, \"eldest son of\r\n_the_ Rush,\" was committed for trial on the charge of breaking into the\r\ndwelling-house of Mr. Abraham Cannell, farmer, Cringleford, on the night\r\nof January 12th.  At the Norfolk Assizes, on March 27th, before Chief\r\nBaron Pollock, the prisoner was acquitted.  At subsequent dates he was\r\ntwice acquitted for housebreaking, but at the Norfolk Quarter Sessions on\r\nMarch 11th, 1862, was sentenced to four years' penal servitude for\r\nbreaking into a house at North Tuddenham.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n13.--In the Court of Queen's Bench, before the Lord Chief Justice and a\r\nspecial jury, an action was brought by Mr. Costerton, solicitor, of\r\nYarmouth, against Sir Edmund Lacon, M.P., for a scandalous attack made\r\nupon the plaintiff by the defendant in the course of an election speech.\r\nThe jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, damages 40s.\r\n\r\n25.--Judgment was given by the Barons of the Exchequer in the cause\r\nMorant _v._ Chamberlin.  It was an action between the Corporation of\r\nYarmouth and Mr. G. D. Palmer, who claimed a right to a portion of the\r\nsouth end of the public quays.  Judgment was for the plaintiff, damages 5\r\npounds 5s.  \"This decision thus settles this long-pending dispute, now\r\nnearly three years from its commencement, and decides the right of the\r\nCorporation to the soil of the quays and the right of the public to the\r\nfree use of the same without any of the inconveniences which for so long\r\na time prevented the proper enjoyment of the part in dispute.  The\r\nverdict gives the plaintiffs the costs of this heavy litigation, except\r\non two unimportant issues.  The defendant will have to pay somewhere\r\nabout 2,800 pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n16.--On this date was published the announcement that the First Norfolk\r\nMounted Rifle Volunteer Corps had been attached to the City of Norwich\r\nRifle Volunteer Corps for administrative purposes.

The plaintiff and\r\ndefendant had taken different sides at the election of a vestry clerk at\r\nYarmouth, and the libel was contained in a handbill issued during the\r\ncontest by the defendant, who referred to the printed statement of the\r\nincome and expenditure of the Guardians, to which body the plaintiff was\r\nclerk, as \"cooked,\" and left the sum of 779 pounds unaccounted for.  The\r\nspecial jury returned a verdict for plaintiff, damages 500 pounds.  In\r\nthe Court of Queen's Bench, on April 17th, Mr. Lush moved for a rule to\r\nset aside the verdict, on the ground of excessive damages.  A rule was\r\ngranted.

Belts and stones were\r\nfreely used.  A party of 200 Artillerymen, armed with swords and knives,\r\nissued from the arsenal, and were going to the assistance of their\r\ncomrades, when Mr. R. Steward, by persuasion and threats, kept the\r\ngreater portion from proceeding further.

We are, therefore, as journalists, exactly 100 years\r\nold. . . .  The difference between the newspapers of the last and present\r\ncentury is, perhaps, more conspicuous in the quantity of space occupied\r\nthan in any other respect, and the present sheet is at least four times\r\nthe size of our first publication.\"\r\n\r\n27.*--\"The repairs at St. Gregory's church, Norwich, the interior of\r\nwhich has been undergoing general restoration, have brought to light an\r\ninteresting fresco, representing the renowned fight between St. George\r\nand the Dragon, a subject which has a local association, St. George being\r\nthe titular saint of the city and patron of a once flourishing civic\r\ncompany.  The painting, which, in all probability, is of a date of the\r\nmiddle of the fifteenth century, was discovered on the removal of the\r\norgan at the west end of the north aisle, for the purpose of cleaning the\r\nwall.  The figures are life-size, and the colours and drawing exceedingly\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n--At the Norfolk Assizes, before Chief Justice Erle and a special jury, a\r\nlibel action, Lane _v._ the Yarmouth Free Press and Printing Company,\r\nLimited, was tried.  Damages were laid at 300 pounds.  The declaration\r\nalleged that the defendants published in a paper called the \"Yarmouth\r\nIndependent,\" certain reflections upon the plaintiff in his capacity as\r\ncollector of market tolls.  The defendants contended that, at the request\r\nof and by agreement with the plaintiff, they had inserted in the\r\nnewspaper a paragraph explaining the alleged libel, and had exonerated\r\nhim from the imputations made against his character, and plaintiff had\r\naccepted it as satisfaction.

The rope was fixed at an altitude of about 60 feet, in a\r\nfield on Newmarket Road.  \"It is a very fortunate circumstance for M.\r\nBlondin that he crossed Niagara and had the Prince of Wales for a\r\nspectator, for it has added a much greater interest to has performances\r\nthan they would otherwise have acquired, and even, if we may judge from\r\nwhat we saw here, they deserved.\"\r\n\r\n4.--Mr. Edward Casson, aged 33, medical superintendent of the County\r\nLunatic Asylum at Thorpe St. Andrew, committed suicide by poisoning\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n8.--Holy Trinity church, Norwich, was consecrated by the Lord Bishop of\r\nthe Diocese.  \"The ceremony should have taken place three weeks\r\npreviously, but at the eleventh hour the Bishop requested that a capital\r\nfund of about 300 pounds should be provided prior to the consecration.\r\nAs the committee were then about 1,000 pounds in debt, it was felt to be\r\nindiscreet to increase their risk, and consequently it was determined to\r\ndelay the opening of the church until they had received nearly all that\r\nthey required.  In less than three weeks more than 1,200 pounds had been\r\nsubscribed out of the 1,300 pounds then supposed to be needed.\"  The\r\nconsecration was attended by the Mayor (Mr. W. J. Utten Browne) and\r\nseveral members of the Corporation.\r\n\r\n29.--A troop of the 15th Hussars left Norwich, _en route_ to York; the\r\nremainder of the regiment marched on September 3rd.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n12.--A great review of the whole of the Volunteer Companies in the county\r\nand city, with the Norwich Mounted Volunteers and the Yarmouth Artillery,\r\nwas held at Holkham Park, by Major-General Sir Archdale Wilson, Bart.,\r\nK.C.B.  This was the first occasion on which the corps had been brigaded\r\nsince their formation.  The review was fixed for eleven o'clock, but in\r\nconsequence of a breakdown in the railway arrangements, and the\r\nconsequent detention of companies on their way to the _rendezvous_, the\r\nparade was not formed until 2.15 p.m.  The troops numbered upwards of\r\n1,700, and were divided into two brigades, commanded respectively by\r\nLieut.-Col. Custance and Major the Hon. F. Walpole, West Norfolk Militia.\r\nThe railway company displayed the same incompetency in conveying the\r\ncorps from Holkham as in taking them there, and the Norwich men did not\r\nreach the city until six o'clock on the morning of the 13th.\r\n\r\n28.--The headquarters of the 5th Dragoon Guards arrived at Norwich\r\nCavalry Barracks, from Aldershot.  \"It is known in the service as the\r\n'Green Horse,' being the only cavalry regiment which wears green\r\nfacings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n13.--Died, Sir William Cubitt, the eminent engineer.  Born in Norfolk, in\r\n1785, he was apprenticed to a joiner, and, becoming a very superior\r\nhandicraftsman, he rapidly took a prominent position as a maker of\r\nagricultural implements.  Within a short time he became a millwright, and\r\nabout 1807 invented self-regulating windmill sails, and ultimately became\r\nconnected with Messrs. Ransome and Son, of Ipswich.  He was the inventor\r\nalso of the treadmill for gaols and houses of correction.  His reputation\r\nincreasing his engagements, it became necessary for him to remove to the\r\nMetropolis in 1826, and after that period there was scarcely a port,\r\nharbour, dock, navigable river, or canal in the United Kingdom with which\r\nhe was not in some way engaged.  The South-Eastern Railway from London to\r\nDover was designed and executed by him.  He undertook the bold project of\r\nblowing away the face of the Round Down cliff, which he successfully\r\nexecuted by exploding 18,000 lbs. of gunpowder in one blast, and\r\nprecipitated one million tons of chalk cliff into the sea.  The great\r\nlanding-stage at Liverpool, the deck of which was nearly one acre in\r\nextent, was a unique example of his work.  As consulting engineer of the\r\nGreat Northern Railway, he materially contributed to the production of\r\none of the best lines in England.  One of his last public works was the\r\nsuperintendence of the construction of the palace for the Great\r\nExhibition in Hyde Park in 1851, which he undertook at the pressing\r\ninstance of his coadjutors on the Royal Commission, and his services were\r\nrecognised in a marked manner by the Queen and the Prince Consort.\r\n\r\n22.--The Mayor of Norwich (Mr. W.

The work selected was \"David Copperfield.\"  On the 29th\r\nhe read \"Nicholas Nickleby at Mr. Squeer's School,\" and the Trial scene\r\nfrom the \"Pickwick Papers.\"  \"Our opinion is,\" the NORFOLK CHRONICLE\r\nremarked, \"that Mr. Dickens as a reader fails to do justice to himself as\r\nan author.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.--Norwich Theatre was opened, under the management of Mr. George Owen.\r\nMr. Sidney, however, retained the lesseeship.\r\n\r\n8.--Died at Hingham, in her 100th year, Mrs. Rebecca Houchen.\r\n\r\n9.--The new Corn Hall at Norwich was opened for business.  The\r\ncontractors for the building were Messrs. Ling and Balls, of Norwich, and\r\nfor the roof Messrs. Barnard, Bishop, and Barnards.  The total cost was\r\nabout 8,000 pounds.  The work was executed from the designs of Mr. Barry,\r\nof Norwich, and Mr. H. Butcher, of 37, Bedford Row, London; and the roofs\r\nwere adapted and carried into detail from the design of the architects by\r\nMr. E. A. Cowper, C.E., of Westminster.  The first brick of the new\r\nbuilding was laid on May 1st, 1861.\r\n\r\n--Mr. John Oddin Taylor was elected Mayor, and Mr. Addison John Cresswell\r\nappointed Sheriff of Norwich.\r\n\r\n10.--Died at North Runcton Rectory, in his 85th year, the Rev. James\r\nCumming, M.A., professor of chemistry in the University of Cambridge, to\r\nwhich office he was elected in 1815.  He was a Fellow of Trinity College,\r\nand had held the living of North Runcton for more than forty years.\r\n\r\n22.--In the Court of the Lords Justices in Lincoln's Inn, a petition was\r\npresented by Major-General Charles Ash Windham, Capt. Windham, the\r\nMarquis of Bristol, Lord Alfred Hervey, M.P., Lord Listowel, and others,\r\npraying that a writ _de lunatico inquirendo_ might issue against William\r\nFrederick Windham.  In support of the petition, affidavits were read\r\nwhich alleged a variety of eccentricities and extravagances on the part\r\nof William Frederick Windham, and laid great stress upon a marriage he\r\nhad contracted with one Agnes Ann Rogers, better known by the name of\r\nAgnes Willoughby.  The judges, after hearing the affidavits on the other\r\nside, considered that a _prima facie_ case had been made out, and allowed\r\nthe prayer of the petition.  On December 4th, in the Vice-Chancellor's\r\nCourt, a motion was heard for the committal of Mr. James Bowen May for\r\ncontempt of court, in having, during the infancy of William Frederick\r\nWindham, and without the knowledge of his guardian or the sanction of the\r\nCourt, drawn or sided and abetted in drawing the said William Frederick\r\nWindham into a promise of marriage with Agues Rogers or Willoughby, in\r\nwhich promises had been made of settlements or dispositions of his\r\nproperty in her favour.  The motion was refused, with costs.  On December\r\n11th the Court of Chancery granted leave to William Frederick Windham to\r\nraise as a mortgage charge on his property the sum of 2,000 pounds, in\r\norder that he might defend himself before the Commission.  The Commission\r\nheld its first sitting in the Court of Exchequer, Westminster, on\r\nDecember 16th, under the presidency of Mr. Samuel Warren, Q.C., one of\r\nthe Masters in Lunacy.  Mr. Windham was the only son of Mr. Howe Windham,\r\nwho died in 1854, and the great-grandson of Mr. Windham, the great\r\npolitician.  He became of age on August 9th, 1861, when he succeeded to\r\nthe Felbrigg Hall estate, worth upwards of 1,200 pounds a year, and to\r\nother properties in which he had a life interest, and which, in the year\r\n1869, would yield him 9,000 pounds a year more.  During his minority he\r\nwas under the guardianship of his uncle, General Windham, and of his\r\nmother, Lady Sophia Hervey.  He married a woman of loose character, upon\r\nwhom he bestowed jewellery of the value of 1,200 or 1,400 pounds, and\r\nupon whom he settled a present annuity of 800 pounds, with a further\r\nannuity of 1,500 pounds contingent upon his coming in to the whole of his\r\nproperty in 1869.  It was also alleged that he sold, in a wild and\r\nreckless way, and upon terms of the utmost disadvantage, the whole of the\r\ntimber, ornamental as well as useful, on the Felbrigg estate.  The\r\ninquiry lasted thirty-four days, and upwards of 150 witnesses were\r\nexamined.  It is said to have cost something like 160 pounds per hour, or\r\nnearly 3 pounds per minute, for all the leading talent of the Bar of\r\nEngland was engaged in the case.  On January 30th, 1862, the jury\r\nreturned the following verdict: \"That the said Mr. William Frederick\r\nWindham, at the time of taking this inquisition, was a person of sound\r\nmind, so as to be sufficient for the government of himself, his manners,\r\nhis messuages, his lands, his tenements, his goods, and his chattels.\"\r\nThe moment the verdict was uttered a loud and enthusiastic cheer rose\r\nfrom the audience, and was repeated again and again.  When Mr. Windham\r\nleft the Court he was received outside with the shouts of an admiring\r\ncrowd, who almost carried him to the cab in which he drove away, amid a\r\ndeafening cheer.  In the Court of Equity, on April 23rd, 1862, the Lords\r\nJustices refused to exonerate the alleged lunatic from the payment of the\r\nwhole of the costs, amounting to 20,000 pounds, consequent upon the\r\nenquiry.\r\n\r\n30.*--\"The portrait of Mr. J. H. Gurney, M.P., President of the Norfolk\r\nand Norwich Museum, has this week been placed on the walls of that\r\ninstitution.  It was painted by F.

This was one of the\r\nso-called matches run during a provincial tour by these pedestrians.\r\nDeerfoot wore his Indian costume, decorated with shells and feathers.  He\r\nstood 5 ft. 11 in., was of muscular frame, but not well knitted, and his\r\nlimbs were long and loose, contrasting badly with the neat, compact\r\nfigure of the \"Milk Boy.\"  Among the spectators of the \"match,\" which\r\nwas, of course, won by the Indian, were the Duke of Wellington and Sir\r\nSamuel Bignold.\r\n\r\n15.--Intelligence was received in Norwich of the death of the Prince\r\nConsort.  Early on the following morning (Monday) the Mayor requested the\r\ncitizens to partially close their business establishments until after the\r\nfuneral.

The Nonconformist\r\nbodies held a united service at St. Andrew's Hall, at which the Rev. John\r\nAlexander delivered an address.  Addresses of condolence with the Queen\r\nwere voted by the Norwich Town Council, on December 30th, and by a county\r\nmeeting, held at the Shirehall, under the presidency of the High Sheriff\r\n(Mr. J. T. Mott), on January 18th, 1862.\r\n\r\n26.--Mr. George Owen produced the Christmas pantomime, \"Puss in Boots,\"\r\nat the Theatre Royal, Norwich; and Mander's Royal Menagerie was exhibited\r\non the Castle Meadow.

He\r\ncontinued there about three years, and during that period acquired, by\r\nhis own industry, a considerable knowledge of algebra, geometry,\r\ntrigonometry, navigation, and French.  Subsequently he obtained a\r\nsituation in a school in Essex, and afterwards proceeded to Shipdham,\r\nwhen, the master dying, he succeeded to the school, and married a\r\nShipdham lady.  He commenced a regular correspondence with the \"Ladies'\r\nDiary,\" then under the management of Dr. Hutton, professor of mathematics\r\nat Woolwich, whose attention was favourably attracted by the\r\ncontributions furnished by Mr. Barlow.  Dr. Hutton recommended him as\r\ncandidate, in 1801, for the post of additional master at the Royal\r\nMilitary Academy, and he was successful.  In 1811 he published his first\r\nwork, \"The Theory of Numbers,\" in 1813, \"The Mathematical Dictionary,\"\r\nand in the same year his \"Mathematical Tables.\"  In 1817 his work, \"The\r\nStrength of Materials,\" was published.  In 1819 he turned his attention\r\nto magnetic experiments, in which he was very successful in developing\r\nthe laws of action and in the application of those laws to the correction\r\nof a long-standing error in navigation.  For this discovery he received\r\nseveral honorary and pecuniary rewards.  His \"Essay on Magnetic\r\nAttraction\" was published in 1819.\r\n\r\n25.--The new Poor Removal Act came into force.

The tide, no longer confined to the channel of the Ouse,\r\nrushed up the drain, broke through the bank on the west side at two\r\nplaces, and, in a wild torrent, overspread the adjacent lands.  Efforts\r\nwere at once made to strengthen the dams, by placing vast quantities of\r\nclinch and gravel at the foot of the piles.  On June 20th, a meeting of\r\nthe owners and occupiers of land was held at the Globe Hotel, Lynn, under\r\nthe presidency of the Rev. Henry ffolkes, at which resolutions were\r\npassed requiring the Middle Level Commissioners to take prompt and\r\nefficient measures to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster.  It was\r\nalso agreed that more satisfactory means for redress for damage should be\r\ngiven than were afforded by the Middle Level Act, and that application be\r\nmade to Parliament for the insertion in the Middle Level Bill then before\r\nthe House of Lords of necessary provisions for securing both objects.  At\r\nthe Norfolk Assizes, on July 29th, before Lord Chief Justice Cockburn,\r\ncommenced the long course of litigation resulting from the inundation.\r\nMr. William Mason, lessee of 18 acres of land at Tilney All Saints,\r\nwithin the Marshland Fen district, sued Mr. Wise, clerk to the Middle\r\nLevel Commissioners, for the recovery of 500 pounds damages sustained\r\nthrough the alleged negligence of the Commissioners in making and\r\nmaintaining the Middle Level Sluice and Drain.  Leave was given to both\r\nsides to move in the Common Pleas or Queen's Bench for the removal of the\r\ntrial to London.  On August 16th it was announced that the expenses\r\nincident to the disaster were estimated at about 25,000 pounds, to meet\r\nwhich 20,000 pounds had been taken up by way of temporary loan.  A second\r\ndisaster occurred on October 4th.  One of the outfall sluices of the\r\nMarshland Smeeth and Fen Drain, an important arterial drain running into\r\nthe Ouse about 200 or 300 yards northward of the ruined Middle Level\r\nSluice, gave way, and again a wide extent of country was submerged.  Four\r\nhundred navvies were at once set to work to form a dam of many thousands\r\nof sacks filled with earth.  On the 5th the temporary dam gave way\r\nbodily, and the entire mass having been carried a score yards up the\r\ndrain, sank out of sight.  The tidal water having overcome the obstacle,\r\nwent with a rush and a roar on its work of devastation, carrying with it\r\ngreat quantities of earth and timber.  About 1,000 acres were flooded;\r\n4,000 acres were under water before the completion of another temporary\r\ndam on the 8th.  After that the water was removed by means of huge\r\nsyphons.  On November 10th the Court of Common Pleas refused a rule for\r\nthe changing of the venue of the trial of the action, Mason _v._ Wise,\r\nfrom Norfolk to Surrey, and with this decision ended the first stage of\r\nthe legal proceedings.

Kemp, Mr. Brookhouse Bowler,\r\nand Mr. Hamilton Braham.\r\n\r\n24.--The Norfolk Volunteer Service Association was formed at a meeting\r\nheld at the Shirehall, Norwich, under the chairmanship of the Lord\r\nLieutenant, who was elected president.  Its objects were, \"the promotion\r\nof rifle shooting and giving permanence to the Volunteer corps throughout\r\nthe county.\"  The first prize-meeting was held on the Mousehold Range,\r\nNorwich, from September 8th to 11th.\r\n\r\n27.--The Channel Squadron, under the command of Rear-Admiral Robert\r\nSmart, arrived in Yarmouth Roads, and on June 1st was joined by the St.\r\nGeorge, with H.R.H. Prince Alfred on board.  The Squadron sailed for the\r\nDowns on the 4th.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n11.--In the Divorce Court, before Sir C. Cresswell, judgement was given\r\nin the action, Burroughs _v._ Burroughs and Silcock.  This was a cross\r\nsuit.  Mrs. Burroughs prayed for the restitution of conjugal rights, and\r\nher husband, in his answer, charged her with adultery, and prayed for a\r\njudicial separation.  In the second case Mr. Burroughs prayed for a\r\ndissolution of marriage, on the ground of his wife's misconduct.  The\r\nsecond case had been tried by a common jury on March 6th, 7th, 8th, and\r\n13th, and terminated in a verdict that neither the petitioner, the\r\nrespondent, nor the co-respondent had been guilty of adultery.  His\r\nlordship had deferred judgment in the first suit, in order that his\r\nopinion might not affect the opinion of the jury in the second suit,\r\nwhich had not then been tried.  He now said he thought Mrs. Burroughs had\r\nmisconducted herself, and he could not order her husband to take her home\r\nagain.  He, therefore, dismissed her petition for restitution.  He\r\nrefused, however, to pronounce a decree of judicial separation, on the\r\nground that as the parties themselves had been examined, he could not\r\ntreat the husband's answer as a counter petition.\r\n\r\n16.--At Swaffham County Court, a jury was engaged in the trial of an\r\naction, Green _v._ Sayers.  The plaintiff, a shoemaker, sought to recover\r\n25 pounds damages for an assault by the defendant, described as \"a circus\r\nproprietor, but better known as the ex-champion of England.\"  The case\r\nexcited great local interest.  \"The defendant,\" it was said, \"conducted\r\nhimself with a degree of modesty, propriety, and decorum that caused no\r\nlittle feeling in his favour.\"  The assault arose out of a dispute as to\r\nthe withholding of change alleged to be due to the plaintiff on money\r\ntendered for admission to the defendant's show, and the jury gave a\r\nverdict for Green, damages 5 pounds.\r\n\r\n19.--A great Volunteer review took place at Yarmouth.  The first brigade\r\nof 910 men was commanded by Lieut.-Col. Astley, Norfolk Artillery; the\r\nsecond (1,230 men) by Lieut.-Col. Sir E. Lacon, Bart., M.P., and the\r\nthird (350 men) by Lieut.-Col. Custance.

The animals were grazing in a field\r\nnear the Chase at King's Lynn, and became engaged in a deadly combat,\r\nwhich ended in the bull disembowelling the horse with its horns.  The\r\nstallion was valued at 60 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--The marriage of H.R.H. Princess Alice and the Grand Duke of Hesse was\r\ncelebrated throughout the county with great rejoicing.

At the\r\nsuggestion of the Court, it was agreed that the only question in dispute,\r\nthat of legal liability, should be raised as a special case.  At the\r\nNorfolk Assizes, on April 1st, before Lord Chief Justice Erle, two\r\nactions, Mason _v._ Wise and Coe _v._ Wise (clerk to the Middle Level\r\nCommissioners), were down for trial by special jury.  It was understood\r\nthat these cases, which were brought for the recovery of damages\r\nconsequent upon the inundation, were selected out of a total of 107\r\ncauses in which writs had been issued.  In the action Coe _v._ Wise, the\r\ndeclaration alleged that by a certain Act of Parliament the Middle Level\r\nCommissioners were bound to make and maintain a certain cut, bank, and\r\nsluices; it was complained that, in consequence of their negligence, the\r\ntidal waters burst through them and flooded the lands of the plaintiff.\r\nThe defendant entered a plea of not guilty, and alleged that the\r\nplaintiff was not possessed of the lands.  The hearing of the case\r\noccupied four days.  The Judge, in summing up, directed the jury to\r\ndecide whether the damage was caused to the plaintiff by the absence of\r\ndue care and skill on the part of the defendants, (1) in respect of the\r\nmaking of the sluice; (2) in respect of maintaining the sluice; (3) in\r\nrespect of providing remedies against mishap after the sluice was\r\ndestroyed; and (4) was damage caused to the plaintiff by reason that no\r\npuddled wall was made along both banks of the cut?  The jury found for\r\nthe defendant on the first point, and for the plaintiff on the other\r\nthree points.  In the Court of Queen's Bench, on April 18th, Mr. Fitzroy\r\nKelly moved for a rule calling upon plaintiff to show cause why the\r\nverdict should not be set aside and entered for the defendant, on the\r\nground of misdirection, and that the verdict was against the evidence.\r\nLord Chief Justice Cockburn said the Court would grant a rule upon the\r\nquestion of law involved, but not as regarded the evidence, because their\r\nlordships found that Lord Chief Justice Erle was satisfied with the\r\nverdict.  The case was again before the Court of Queen's Bench on\r\nNovember 19th, and, alter two days' argument, was ordered to stand over\r\nuntil the next term.

In 1803 he projected\r\nand commenced the Tavistock Canal, of which about three miles were\r\ntunnelled through a granite hill.  The execution of this work led to the\r\ndiscovery of two other mines, which produced large quantities of copper,\r\nand yielded considerable profits.  The success of these and other mines\r\nin the neighbourhood of Tavistock, in Cornwall, and in the North of\r\nEngland, brought Mr. Taylor into great repute as a mining engineer.

According to Mr. Simms Reeve, who appeared for the\r\nprosecution, the Dean and Chapter of Norwich owned the Heath, and the\r\npeople of Pockthorpe, whether they had the right or not, claimed common\r\nrights.  The Dean and Chapter did not dispute those rights, and the\r\npeople not only used the Heath themselves, but let it to others to graze\r\ntheir cattle, to take turf at so much per hundred, and gravel at so much\r\nper load.  The revenue formed a common fund, managed by a committee\r\nelected each year at a public meeting, at which the clergyman of the\r\nparish presided.  The defendants contested these rights, and liberated\r\nstock which had been impounded.

In descending, he was\r\ncompelled to stoop head foremost to grasp the handle of Britannia's\r\ntrident.  From some cause he slipped, fell upon the plinth, and thence\r\nrebounded into space, falling with arms outstretched to the base of the\r\ncolumn, a depth of 144 feet.

Lord Chief Justice\r\nCockburn thought the defendants were not liable, and said that the rule\r\nmust be made absolute.  Rule absolute accordingly.  (_See_ June 9th,\r\n1865.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.--Died, aged 91, Mr. John Bennett, for many years resident in Norwich.\r\n\"The deceased wore a pigtail to the day of his death and was the last of\r\nthe old school in the city.\"\r\n\r\n13.--It was announced that an attempt was being made to form a religious\r\norder or brotherhood in Norwich, and that a house on Elm Hill, formerly\r\noccupied by Mr. Elisha De Hague, had been purchased for conversion into a\r\nmonastery.  Shortly afterwards a party of five brethren, headed by \"the\r\nnotorious Brother Ignatius,\" took up their quarters in the newly-acquired\r\npremises, and, it was asserted, had the countenance, if not the active\r\nsupport, of advanced High Churchmen in the city, under whose auspices at\r\nthis date lectures were delivered \"in defence of Church principles,\" one\r\nof the lecturers being the Rev. Dr. A. F. Littledale.  On February 24th,\r\nthe \"Benedictine chapel,\" known as the \"priory of St. Mary and Dunstan,\"\r\nwas dedicated by Ignatius.  From this date scenes of disorder and riot\r\nwere of frequent occurrence in the neighbourhood of the monastery, and\r\ndirectly and indirectly the existence of the confraternity gave rise to\r\nseveral remarkable incidents.  During Easter week the \"monks\" made daily\r\nvisits to St. Lawrence' church, which had already been brought into\r\nnotoriety by the ritualistic practices of the rector, the Rev. E. A.\r\nHillyard.  There daily Communion was celebrated, and the brethren walking\r\nin procession to and from the church were assailed and insulted by the\r\nmob.  The protection of the police was demanded by Ignatius, and the\r\nmagistrates were frequently engaged in the hearing of cases of riot and\r\nassault arising out of the proceedings at Elm Hill and St. Lawrence'.  A\r\nspirit of unrest manifested itself in other directions.  On April 6th a\r\nperson calling himself the Baron De Camin, who stated that he was an\r\nex-priest of the Romish Church, delivered, at the Victoria Hall, St.\r\nAndrew's, a lecture full of scurrilous and indecent observations.  A\r\nscene of great tumult ensued; the gas was extinguished, and, under cover\r\nof darkness, the \"baron\" escaped.  Another lecturer appeared on the 14th\r\nand 15th, in the person of Signor (formerly Father) Allessandro Gavazzi,\r\nwho delivered orations at St. Andrew's Hall, on \"Romish Encroachments at\r\nHome\" and \"Garibaldi and Italy's Impending Future.\"  Whilst the High\r\nChurch party were taking an aggressive stand in the city, a section of\r\nthe Low Church party in the county, led by the Rev. W. Haslam, of\r\nBuckenham, were seeking, under the name of \"Revivalism,\" to introduce\r\nNonconformist methods into the services of the Church.  Meanwhile\r\nofficial notice was taken of Mr. Hillyard's proceedings.  At a meeting of\r\nthe Board of Guardians, on April 28th, it was agreed, \"That the Rev. E.\r\nA. Hillyard having identified himself with certain persons calling\r\nthemselves monks, whom he has allowed to participate in the services of\r\nhis church, no longer holds the confidence of the Board, and is called\r\nupon to resign his situation as chaplain of the Norwich Workhouse.\"  Mr.\r\nHillyard declined to vacate the office, and a deputation of the Board\r\nwaited upon the Bishop, who expressed strong disapproval of the reverend\r\ngentleman's action.  A meeting of the parishioners of St. Lawrence'\r\npassed a resolution on May 6th: \"That this vestry views with grief and\r\nindignation the manner in which Divine worship has been performed of\r\nlate, particularly as regards the dressing of the Communion table, and\r\nthe minister allowing persons calling themselves monks to take a\r\nprominent part in the performance of the services.\"  The resolution was\r\nnumerously signed by the parishioners and presented to the Bishop.  St.\r\nGregory's church, during the incumbency of the Rev. W. B. Sharpe, became\r\na centre of ritualism, and on June 9th advantage was taken, on the\r\nappointment of the new incumbent, the Rev. J. Wortley, to petition the\r\nArchdeacon of Norwich to sanction the removal of \"a floral cross and\r\nother floral decorations from the chancel and the candlesticks from the\r\nCommunion table, of monograms and emblems recently painted on the chancel\r\nsteps, and of the curtains and drapery from the walls of the chancel, and\r\nto order the restoration of the Commandments, the Belief, and the Lord's\r\nPrayer in their place\"; and the minister was requested \"to discontinue\r\nthe weekly offering, as it was strongly objected to by many of the\r\nparishioners.\"  On August 23rd Mr. Wortley announced that many of the\r\nobjectionable ornaments had been removed; and on August 27th it was\r\nstated that the English Church Union had resolved to raise a special fund\r\nto meet expenses that might be incurred by Mr. Smith, churchwarden, in\r\nlegally protesting against the action which had led to their removal.  On\r\nJune 27th a meeting of the supporters of the district schools of the\r\nassociated parishes of St. Peter Mancroft, St. John Maddermarket, St.\r\nGregory, St. Lawrence, and St. Margaret, resolved \"That the Rev. E. A.\r\nHillyard had entirely forfeited the confidence of the committee, by\r\nmixing himself up with certain persons calling themselves monks, and Mr.\r\nHenry Browne finding it impossible, under the circumstances, to collect\r\nsubscriptions, had therefore refused to continue to act with Mr.\r\nHillyard, either as treasurer, secretary, or manager.\"  Mr. Hillyard upon\r\nthis decision severed his connection with the association, but refused to\r\naccede to a request, signed by some of the leading clergy in Norwich and\r\nNorfolk, on July 2nd, to discontinue his practices at St. Lawrence' or to\r\ncomply with the wishes of the Bishop.  On August 17th the Guardians\r\npassed a resolution prohibiting his further attendance at the Workhouse;\r\nand on October 25th Sir John Walsham, the Poor-Law Inspector for the\r\ndistrict, held an inquiry at the Guildhall into his conduct.  The\r\nPoor-Law Board, on December 14th, intimated to the Guardians that they\r\nhad dismissed Mr. Hillyard from the chaplaincy.  The Elm Hill monastery\r\nwas closed in May, 1866, and the building work of a proposed new chapel\r\nto be erected by Ignatius suspended.  (_See_ January 16th, 1869.)\r\n\r\n22.--Died at Sidcup, Kent, in his 96th year, Mr. Edward Smyth, formerly\r\nagent in Norwich of the Bank of England.  His early career was spent in\r\nthe Army.  He served at the fall of Seringapatam, in 1799, with the 25th\r\nLight Dragoons, who, at Mullavelly, routed the cavalry of Tippoo Sahib,\r\nthereby enabling Lord Harris to bring to a successful termination his\r\nsiege operations against that important fortress.  Mr. Smith afterwards\r\nserved with the Duke of Wellington in that Indian campaign which ended\r\nwith the famous battles of Assaye and Urgam.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.--The agitation for the repeal of the Malt Tax was re-opened with\r\nincreased vigour at a large meeting of West Norfolk farmers, held at the\r\nTown Hall, Lynn, under the presidency of the High Sheriff (Mr. H. Lee\r\nWarner).  A resolution was passed affirming that the tax was unjust in\r\nprinciple, utterly opposed to the Free Trade policy adopted on the repeal\r\nof the Corn Laws, and most injurious to British farmers as producers of\r\nbarley.  Members of Parliament were urged to support its repeal.\r\n\r\n9.--Sir Henry Stracey announced to the electors of Yarmouth his intention\r\nof retiring from the representation of the borough.\r\n\r\n10.--The Mayor of Yarmouth (Mr. R. Steward), who, for the fourth time,\r\nhad held that office, was presented with a piece of plate, valued at 200\r\ngs., in appreciation of his public services and his private worth.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--The church of St. John Maddermarket, Norwich, was re-opened by the\r\nBishop of Norwich.  Extensive repairs and restoration had been carried\r\nout, under the direction of Messrs. Elmslie, Franey, and Haddon, of\r\nLondon, at the cost of 1,431.\r\n\r\n9.*--\"Col. Black, Chief Constable of the county, has accepted the command\r\nof the Norwich Battalion of Volunteers, as offered him by the Lord\r\nLieutenant, on the retirement of Lieut.-Col. Brett.\"\r\n\r\n22.--Died at his residence, Prince of Wales Road, Norwich, Mr. David\r\nHodgson, artist.  He was the son of Mr. Charles Hodgson.  \"The names of\r\nboth father and son are connected with the list of local celebrities in\r\nArt, in which may be included the names of Crome, Vincent, Stark, and\r\nJoseph Stannard.\"  David Hodgson excelled in architectural subjects,\r\nwhich he painted with great care and truthfulness of detail.\r\n\r\n26.--The marriage of Viscount Powerscourt and Lady Julia Coke, eldest\r\ndaughter of the Earl and Countess of Leicester, was solemnised at St.\r\nGeorge's church, Hanover Square.\r\n\r\n27.--The first meeting of the Norwich Geological Society was held under\r\nthe presidency of the Rev. J. Gunn, F.G.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--The Bill for the projected East Norfolk Railway was considered before\r\na Committee of the House of Commons.  It was strongly opposed by the\r\nYarmouth Haven and Pier Commissioners, and by the North Walsham and\r\nDilham Canal Commissioners, as offering unfair competition with water\r\ncommunication in that part of the county.  (_See_ October 18th, 1865.)\r\n\r\n16.--Mr. Edmund Rosenthal's grand English opera and burlesque company\r\ncommenced an engagement at Norwich Theatre.  The _artistes_ included\r\nMadame Haigh-Dyer, Miss Ada Taylor, Miss Hodgson, Miss Brooke, Miss\r\nAlessandri, Miss Bronti, Miss Mills, Miss Shepherd, Miss Tempest, and\r\nMiss Marian Taylor; Mr. W. Parkinson, Mr. J. Manley, Mr. Tempest, Mr.\r\nWarden, Mr. Bentley, Mr. Melville, Mr. R. Arthur, Mr. Smith, Mr. Arnott,\r\nMr. Morgan, and Mr. Edmund Rosenthal.  The operas produced were\r\n\"Maritana,\" \"Lucia di Lammermoor,\" &c., and the burlesque \"Prince\r\nAmabel.\"\r\n\r\n19.--The Norfolk Hotel, Norwich, was sold by Messrs. Spelman, at the\r\nAuction Mart, London, for the sum of 4,000.\r\n\r\n24.--The Queen's birthday was observed at Norwich as a general holiday.\r\nThe 18th Hussars, the Norfolk Light Horse, the Artillery and Rifle\r\nVolunteers, and the Cadet Corps were reviewed in Chapel Field; the\r\nofficers were entertained at luncheon at the Guildhall, and the\r\nVolunteers at the Corn Hall; and at night the Mayor and Miss Springfield\r\ngave a ball at St. Andrew's Hall.\r\n\r\n30.--Died at his seat, Raveningham Hall, Sir Edmund Bacon, premier\r\nbaronet of England.  Born in 1779, he was the eldest son of the eighth\r\nbaronet, by Anne, eldest daughter of Sir William Beauchamp Proctor,\r\nBart., of Langley Park.  He was educated at Rugby, and succeeded to the\r\nbaronetcy in 1820.  In 1801 he married his cousin, Mary Anne Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter of Mr. Dashwood Bacon, of Ottery St. Mary, Devon, who died in\r\n1820, leaving two sons and three daughters.  Sir Edmund served the office\r\nof High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1826, and was a magistrate and\r\nDeputy-Lieutenant for the county.  He was succeeded in his title and\r\nestates by his nephew, a son of Mr. Nicholas Bacon, for many years\r\nresident in Norwich.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--Died at his residence, Tombland, Norwich, Mr. Roger Kerrison, aged\r\n61.  He had for some time been in ill-health, and five weeks before his\r\ndeath, while superintending the cutting down of some timber, sustained a\r\nfall and received a severe shock.  Mr. Kerrison was, in many respects, a\r\nremarkable personage.  He was the son of Mr. Allday Kerrison, and was\r\neducated for the law, a profession he continued to practise until his\r\ndecease, although a large accession of fortune on the death of his uncle,\r\nMr. Matthew Kerrison, of Ranworth, twenty years previously, had placed\r\nhim in independent circumstances.  Mr. Kerrison held several important\r\npublic appointments, but he was more widely known by reason of his\r\nconnection with the Norwich Triennial Musical Festival, of which he was\r\nfor some years the active honorary secretary.  In politics he was\r\nConservative, but by no means a prejudiced partisan, and he never\r\nscrupled to act independently when he deemed it right to do so.  He was a\r\nbachelor, and the bulk of his fortune went to his brother, Mr. Allday\r\nKerrison, a partner in the Crown Bank, Norwich.\r\n\r\n3.--Died, in his 78th year, Mr. William Johnson Fox, for many years\r\nmember of Parliament for Oldham, and popularly known as \"the Norwich\r\nWeaver Boy.\"\r\n\r\n7.--The 18th Hussars left Norwich for Shorncliffe, prior to their\r\nembarkation for India.  This was the first regiment which departed from\r\nthe city by train.\r\n\r\n8.--The annual show of the Norfolk Agricultural Association was held at\r\nLynn, and was visited by upwards of 14,000 persons.  Mr. R. J. H. Harvey\r\nwas president for the year.\r\n\r\n18.--Died, near Christchurch, New Zealand, aged 59, the Ven. Octavius\r\nMathias, Archdeacon of Akaron and formerly vicar of Horsford.  He was one\r\nof the first to take an interest in the foundation of Canterbury\r\nCathedral, New Zealand, and was elected one of the capitular clergy.\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--A barque, named the Oriental, was launched from Mr. J. W. Rust's\r\nshipyard at Yarmouth.  The vessel, which was intended for the China\r\ntrade, was 115 feet long, 24 feet beam, 15 ft. 8 inches in depth, and 320\r\ntons burthen.\r\n\r\n9.*--\"An agreement has been entered into for the purchase, by the\r\nProvincial Banking Corporation, of the business of the East of England\r\nBank, an unlimited joint stock bank established in 1836, with head office\r\nat Norwich and branches at Yarmouth, Lynn, North Walsham, Fakenham, East\r\nDereham, Swaffham, Bungay, Halesworth, and Harleston, and agencies at\r\nWymondham, Wells, and Hingham.\"  The city was startled on the 20th by the\r\nrumour that the Bank had suspended payment.  \"On those who had accounts\r\nat the Bank going to that establishment, the doors were found to be\r\nclosed, and a printed notice was exhibited in the windows to the effect\r\nthat the directors regretted to intimate that they were compelled to\r\nsuspend business.  Up to the hour of closing on the previous day the\r\ndirectors, after having resolved to suspend payment, continued to receive\r\nthe money of unsuspecting customers.\"  A few days afterwards was issued a\r\nstatement, from which it appeared that the Bank's liabilities were\r\n576,963 7s. 6d., and assets 453,256 5s. 3d., leaving a deficit of 123,707\r\n2s. 3d.  Meetings of the shareholders were held, at which resolutions\r\nwere passed in favour of registering the company under the Companies Act,\r\n1862, with the view to a voluntary winding up.  On August 13th it was\r\nannounced that the Provincial Banking Company had issued a circular to\r\nthe late customers of the Bank, stating \"that being satisfied there was a\r\nprobability of the customers being paid in full, they had authorised the\r\nbranch managers at once to give credit to each customer of the East of\r\nEngland Bank in his pass-book for the full amount of the balance due to\r\nhim on his current account with the East of England Bank.\"  Messrs.\r\nHarveys and Hudsons, immediately after the issue of the circular, offered\r\nlike terms.  Dividends were, in due course, paid to the creditors of the\r\nBank.  In July, 1866, it was stated that the liquidators had announced \"a\r\nfurther dividend of 2s. 6d. in the pound, which will make 20s. in the\r\npound distributed, exclusive of interest, payment of which is postponed.\"\r\n\r\n23.--Died at the Palace Hotel, Buckingham Gate, London, Admiral Bertie\r\nCornelius Cator, younger brother of Mr. John Cator, of Beckenham, Kent,\r\nand of Woodbastwick.  He entered the Navy in 1800, under his uncle,\r\nCaptain Albemarle Bertie, and was actively employed early in his\r\nprofessional career in the capture of privateers in the Mediterranean.\r\nIn 1810 he assisted at the taking of the Isle of France; commanded the\r\nActaeon on the coast of America in the attack on the enemy's barracks in\r\nLynn Haven Bay in 1813, and participated in various other services.\r\nAfter gaining post rank, he was not employed afloat.  He accepted\r\nretirement in 1846.\r\n\r\n29.--Merton Park was the scene of great rejoicing, on the coming of age\r\nof the Hon. Thomas de Grey.  Seven hundred cottagers and labourers were\r\nentertained at dinner, and Lord and Lady Walsingham received a large\r\nnumber of personal friends in a pavilion erected near the famous Merton\r\noak.  At luncheon Lord Ashburton proposed the health of Mr. de Grey,\r\nwhich was drunk with great enthusiasm.  The day's festivities concluded\r\nwith a display of fireworks.  On the 30th Lord and Lady Walsingham gave a\r\nball to 150 tenants on the Merton estate, and on the 31st the celebration\r\nended with a servants' ball.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST.\r\n\r\n\r\n26.--Two troops of the 16th Lancers arrived at Norwich Barracks.\r\n\r\n28.--St. George's Brewery, Norwich, and 40 public-houses were offered for\r\nsale by Messrs. Spelman.  Messrs. Youngs, Crawshay, and Youngs were the\r\npurchasers, at the sum of 15,300.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n11.--Died at Norwich, aged 81, Henry Drane, for thirty-six years\r\nproprietor of the Telegraph coach.\r\n\r\n19.--A prize-fight for 5 took place near Lynn, between Pooley Mace and\r\nGrey.  Mace was declared the victor, after a contest which lasted 35\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--The Yarmouth Town Council, by a majority of 25 to 11, adopted the\r\nPublic House Closing Act, 1864.\r\n\r\n8.--The first sod of the West Norfolk Junction Railway was turned by Miss\r\nEllen Simpson, daughter of Mr. Lightly Simpson, the chairman of the\r\ncompany.  Many persons travelled to Heacham to take part in the\r\nproceedings.  (_See_ January 8th, 1866.)\r\n\r\n11.--Died, Captain Becher, \"the well-known sportsman and father of\r\nsteeplechase riders, whose deeds in the pigskin some 30 years back have\r\nimmortalised him in the annals of that sport.\"  Captain Becher was born\r\nin Norfolk, and was the son of a farmer, \"who was very conspicuous as a\r\nhorseman and the last of the leather breeches school.\"\r\n\r\n16.--A new screw steamer, the Ontario, 3,200 tons, Captain Brooklin, upon\r\nher first voyage, from Shields to Alexandria, laden with coals and iron,\r\nstruck upon Happisburgh Sand.  Three steam tugs and the Caister lifeboat\r\nproceeded to her assistance, and her cargo was thrown overboard, but\r\nevery effort made to get her off proved unavailing.  On the 17th the\r\nweather became very threatening, and the lifeboat took off 56 coal\r\nheavers, but the captain and officers and 86 of the crew determined to\r\nremain with the vessel.  During the night the storm increased, and the\r\ncrew, apparently in great distress, sent up rockets and burned blue\r\nlights.  The Yarmouth lifeboatmen were implored by the ship's agent, Mr.\r\nButler, to go to the ship, but in vain.  They refused to launch the\r\nlifeboat unless they were paid from 400 to 500, saying that the steam\r\ntugs had begun the work and had better finish it.  The Caister lifeboat\r\nstood by the vessel, which, by the 20th, had so settled down that it was\r\nhopeless to attempt to get her off.  On this day 68 of the crew left in a\r\nlifeboat belonging to the steamer, but the captain and officers declined\r\nto desert her.  They were, however, compelled to leave on the 22nd, when\r\nshe became a total wreck, and was offered for sale.  The original value\r\nof the Ontario was 120,000.\r\n\r\n21.--The church of St. Nicholas, Yarmouth, was opened after restoration,\r\nat the cost of about 6,000.  The sermon was preached by the Bishop of\r\nOxford, and at the luncheon held subsequently, under the presidency of\r\nthe Mayor (Mr. R. Steward), the company included the Bishops of Norwich\r\nand Oxford, the Bishop of British Columbia, Lord Sondes (High Steward of\r\nthe borough), and many other distinguished guests.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.--Mr. Charles Edward Tuck was elected Mayor, and Mr. Charles Jecks\r\nappointed Sheriff of Norwich.\r\n\r\n9.--Died at Keswick, near Norwich, in his 90th year, Mr. Hudson Gurney.\r\nHe was the eldest son of Mr. Richard Gurney, who died at Keswick in 1811.\r\nEducated by Dr. Thomas Young, of scientific celebrity, he became\r\nconnected early in life with the great banking firm of the Gurneys, of\r\nwhich he was for many years senior partner, as well as with the noted\r\nLondon brewery of Barclay and Co., his mother being the daughter and\r\nheiress of Mr. David Barclay, of Youngbury, Herts.  In 1809 he married\r\nMargaret, daughter of Robert Barclay, of Ury, descended from the\r\ncelebrated Barclay, the Apologist for the Quakers.  Mrs. Gurney died at\r\nKeswick on December 16th, 1855.  In politics Mr. Gurney was, in many\r\nrespects, decidedly Conservative, though on some points he held opinions\r\nmore in accordance with the most advanced Liberalism, and, as a perfectly\r\nindependent member, allied himself to no party in particular.  His\r\nParliamentary career commenced in 1812, when he was elected for\r\nShaftesbury; from the year 1816 he represented Newport, Hants., in six\r\nsuccessive Parliaments.  In 1835 he served the office of High Sheriff for\r\nthe county of Norfolk.  He was a man of high literary attainments, and\r\nwas vice-president of the Society of Antiquaries, a Fellow of the Royal\r\nand Linnaean Societies, vice-president of the Norwich Museum, the\r\nLiterary Institute, and of the Norfolk and Norwich Archaeological\r\nSociety.  As an author his chief production was probably the beautiful\r\npoem in English verse under the title of \"Cupid and Psyche,\" a\r\nmythological tale from the \"Golden Ass\" of Apuleius; in 1801 it had\r\nreached a third edition, and was afterwards reprinted in Mr. Davenport's\r\n\"Poetical Register.\"  He also published, for private distribution, in\r\n1843, a translation into English verse of the \"Orlando Furioso\" of\r\nLudovico Ariosto; and in 1847, in a letter to Mr. Dawson Turner, \"Proofs\r\nthat Norwich, and not Caistor, was the Venta Icenorum.\"  In his latter\r\nyears, confined almost entirely to his own residence, \"he reversed in his\r\nhours the usual custom, amusing himself with his books and writings till\r\nfour or five o'clock in the morning, and, of course, rising comparatively\r\nlate in the day.\"  His estate, real and personal included, was valued at\r\n1,200,000.\r\n\r\n--The Lynn Town Council resolved to put an end to the absurd and\r\nobnoxious impost known as \"the Lady Mayoresses' Pin Money.\"  \"For many\r\nyears the custom has prevailed in the town of the constables (who perform\r\nno other duties) going round to all the inhabitants in October and\r\nNovember and collecting from all who were foolish enough to pay it a kind\r\nof blackmail, under the ridiculous title of the Lady Mayoresses' Pin\r\nMoney, pretending that it was legally payable under the charters, and\r\nthat those who did not pay would be summoned before the magistrates or\r\nthe County Court.  It appears that the custom has grown out of the\r\ncollection of fines for non-attendance at the Court Leet held annually by\r\nthe Mayor as Lord of the Manor; but for many generations past no such\r\nattendance has been either any use or capable of enforcement.  The fines\r\nhave also completely lapsed, and those who collect the 'pin money' are\r\ncompletely ignorant of its origin.  The pretence has been that the money\r\nwas to buy a piece of plate for the Mayoress, but in reality the greater\r\npart of it has been appropriated by the collectors themselves, and of the\r\nmany pounds obtained not more than some fifty shillings annually found\r\nits way into the borough fund.\"\r\n\r\n12.*--\"There appears to be some probability that the absurd system of\r\ninspection of weights and measures at Lynn by a 'jury of headboroughs'\r\ngoing round the town in a posse and discharging their functions in such a\r\nmanner that the innocent only are punished and the guilty easily escape\r\ndetection, is about to come to an end.  Several persons have refused to\r\nadmit the headboroughs on their premises, and others have declined to pay\r\nthe fines imposed on them by the 'jury'; and as the authority of this\r\njury is based on ancient charters of very doubtful legal force, and there\r\nis no prospect of that authority being respected or enforced, the jury\r\nhave refused to be sworn in again on the Court Leet by which they are\r\nappointed.  It may be hoped, therefore, that the farce has come to an\r\nend, and that very shortly a proper and efficient officer will be\r\nappointed under the provisions of the Weights and Measures Act.\"\r\n\r\n14.--The newly-erected chancel of St. Mark's church, Lakenham, Norwich,\r\nbuilt at the cost of about 1,000, was consecrated by the Bishop of\r\nNorwich.\r\n\r\n24.--A severe gale occurred off the Norfolk coast.  Many shipping\r\ncasualties were reported.  The screw steamer William Hutt, 530 tons,\r\nemployed as a transport during the Crimean War, was lost off Yarmouth\r\nwith her crew of sixteen hands, whilst on a voyage from Sunderland to\r\nLondon, with coals.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n17.*--\"Mr. Thomas W. Rutland, carpenter, West Wymer Street, Norwich, has\r\ninvented a very ingenious means of communication between the passengers\r\nand guard in a railway train.  It has the additional advantage of acting\r\nalso as an extra break when required.  By its use a passenger can at once\r\ncommunicate with both guard and driver, and at the same time a signal is\r\nexhibited which shows from what carriage the alarm is given.\"\r\n\r\n20.--At a special meeting of the Norwich Town Council, a communication\r\nwas received from the Dean and Chapter as to the giving up of their\r\ninterest in Mousehold Heath, with the view of enabling the Council to\r\nconvert the Heath into a people's park.\r\n\r\n26.--The Christmas \"burlesque and comic pantomime\" produced at Norwich\r\nTheatre was written by F. C.

Harveys and Hudson, which\r\nis now approaching completion by Messrs. Lucas, nor will there be one\r\nwhich has been erected at so small a comparative cost.  The contract for\r\nthe new bank, of which Mr. P. Hardwicke is the architect, does not exceed\r\n13,000.\"  The bank was opened for business on January 1st, 1866.\r\n\r\n13.--The Prince of Wales visited Lord Walsingham, at Merton Hall, and\r\nattended a meet of the West Norfolk Hunt.

The Norwich Town Council, at a meeting on March\r\n21st, decided to oppose the measure.  A Committee of the House of\r\nCommons, by whom the Bill was considered, on March 30th unanimously\r\nresolved that, \"in the absence of unanimity of feeling among the parties\r\naffected, including the town of Yarmouth itself, it is not expedient to\r\npass the preamble of the Bill.\"  It was, therefore, thrown out.

Salter's farm at Attleborough.  \"In their lightness and\r\nsymmetry the former presented a strong contrast.  The Norfolk plough drew\r\nnearly half as heavy again as the iron ploughs, or in the proportion of 3\r\nto 2 in the shallow work, and in the deep work one quarter heavier, or in\r\nthe proportion of 4 to 5.\"\r\n\r\n10.--A remarkable incident occurred at Lakenham church.  A wedding had\r\nbeen arranged, and the Rev. C. Baldwin, of St. Stephen's, Norwich, had\r\npromised, with the approbation of the vicar, the Rev. A. Pownall, to\r\nofficiate.  When the wedding party arrived at Lakenham, they found the\r\nchurch closed.  An entrance was effected, but the vestry was locked, and\r\nneither surplice nor books were provided for the clergyman.  \"It was\r\nsuggested that a sheet should be borrowed, and the Rev. Mr. Baldwin,\r\nhabited in this novel vestment, proceeded to unite the parties in the\r\nbonds of matrimony, and after having sent to the clergyman's house for\r\nthe parish registers, the happy couple were at length enabled to proceed\r\non their wedding trip.  Mr. Pownall, who was himself the cause of the\r\nwhole difficulty, having forgotten to inform the clerk of the forthcoming\r\nceremony, issued the following extraordinary handbill:--'Lakenham church.\r\nA solemn service will be held on Friday, the 24th inst., to avert the\r\nwrath of Almighty God and to deprecate His righteous judgments in\r\nconsequence of the profanation of His sanctuary on Monday last . . .\r\nEzekiel v., 11.'\"  The incident gave rise to much comment.\r\n\r\n15.--A great fire occurred at Frazer's sawmills, near St.\r\nMartin-at-Palace church, Norwich, and resulted in the loss of about 4,000\r\nworth of property.\r\n\r\n18.--Died at North Walsham, Mary Doughty, aged 101 years.\r\n\r\n28.--At the Norfolk Assizes, before Lord Chief Justice Cockburn, was\r\ntried a remarkable action for assault, false imprisonment, and malicious\r\nprosecution.  The plaintiff, Mr. Albert Pell (son of Sir Albert Pell, of\r\nNorthamptonshire), with his brother, while on a visit to Yarmouth,\r\ncrossed the fields of the defendant, Mr. Mayes Wigg, at Caister.  They\r\nhad with them a Skye terrier, and defendant, alleging that they were\r\npoaching, gave them into the custody of a policeman, who, after detaining\r\nthem at his cottage, took them before a magistrate at Thrigby.  The\r\ncharge was dismissed, whereupon the present action was commenced.  The\r\njury found for the plaintiff on the first count, charging assault and\r\nfalse imprisonment, and awarded damages 5; and for defendant on the\r\nsecond count, charging malicious prosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--Died at Yarmouth, Mr. George Danby Palmer, aged 77.  In early life\r\nMr. Palmer was an active supporter of the Tory party, but previous to the\r\npassing of the Reform Bill he adopted Liberal principles, and after the\r\nintroduction of the Municipal Reform Act became decidedly Radical.  He\r\nwas the oldest member of the borough Bench, and a justice of the peace\r\nfor the county.  \"Possessed of large property, he lavished his wealth\r\nwith unsparing hand upon those whom he deemed worthy of his assistance,\r\nbut as it was rendered so unobtrusively, with the exception of the\r\nrecipients of his bounty, the world was not aware of his generosity.  He\r\nwas a straightforward Englishman, and was greatly lamented by all classes\r\nin Yarmouth.\"\r\n\r\n17.--The English Grand Opera Company, under the management of Mr. G. B.\r\nLoveday, commenced an engagement at Norwich Theatre.  Madame Haigh-Dyer,\r\nMiss Annie Kemp, Miss Ada Taylor, Mr. Brookhouse Bowler, Mr. Grantham,\r\nMr. E.

The defendant was proceeded against for taking shingle, sand,\r\nand shell-fish from the sea shore in the manor of Snettisham, belonging\r\nto the plaintiff.  About twenty special pleas were set up by the\r\ndefendant and demurred to in point of law, on the broad ground that there\r\ncould not be in law any such rights as alleged, \"either in all the\r\nsubjects of the realm or by Royal grant or by custom or by prescription\r\nin inhabitants or occupiers.\"  The Court deferred judgment, and\r\nultimately referred the case to the Norfolk Assizes for decision as to\r\nquestions of fact.  At Norwich, on August 4th, the case was adjourned to\r\nenable the plaintiff to amend the declarations.  The case came before\r\nLord Chief Justice Erle at the Norfolk Assizes on August 13th, 1866, when\r\nthe jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, damages one shilling.  In\r\nthe Court of Queen's Bench, on May 28th, 1867, application was made for a\r\nnew trial, on the ground of misdirection and that the verdict was given\r\nfor the plaintiff against the weight of evidence.  The application was\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\n23.--An earthquake shock was distinctly felt along the coast from\r\nScratby, on the north of Yarmouth, to Lowestoft, on the south.\r\n\r\n24.--The Queen's birthday was observed as a general holiday at Norwich.\r\nA detachment of the 16th Lancers and the Volunteers were reviewed in\r\nChapel Field, and fired a _feu de joie_ in the Market Place; the Mayor\r\ngave a luncheon at the Guildhall, and the Volunteers were entertained at\r\nthe Corn Hall.  The Mayor's ball took place in the evening, at St.\r\nAndrew's Hall.\r\n\r\n27.--Considerable opposition was manifested, not only by the villagers,\r\nbut by the citizens of Norwich, to an attempt made by Capt. Bellairs to\r\nenclose Mulbarton Common.  A meeting was held in the village, at which a\r\nstrong protest was made against the proposal, and it was asserted that if\r\never the ancestors of Capt. Bellairs had possessed the power to effect\r\nthe enclosure, they had allowed their rights to lapse.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--The detachment of the 16th Lancers, _en route_ to India, marched from\r\nthe Cavalry Barracks, Norwich, accompanied to the city boundary by the\r\nofficers and band of the Norfolk Light Horse Volunteers.\r\n\r\n7.--Mr. A. Dennison, brother of the Speaker of the House of Commons,\r\nvisited Norwich, for the purpose of hearing the bells of St. Peter\r\nMancroft.  \"He rang the tenor in good style, and was highly delighted\r\nwith the quality of tone of this far-famed peal of twelve.\"\r\n\r\n9.--In the Court of the Queen's Bench, application was made in the\r\naction, the Queen _v._ the Middle Level Commissioners, for a rule calling\r\nupon them to show cause why a mandamus should not issue commanding them\r\nto make and maintain a bridge with a commodious road or hailing path in\r\nthe place formerly occupied by their sluice which was destroyed in the\r\ngreat inundation in 1862.  A rule was granted.  (_See_ January 7th,\r\n1867.)\r\n\r\n13.--At a special meeting of the Norwich Town Council, a report was\r\nreceived from Mr. Bazalgette, C.E., who had visited Norwich with the view\r\nof determining what steps could be taken for the immediate purification\r\nof the river Wensum in the vicinity of the city.  He stated that it would\r\nbe impossible to render the river pure so long as it continued to be a\r\nreceptacle for the town refuse; and he had examined the city and suburbs\r\nto ascertain how to improve the drainage and to dispose of the sewage.\r\nThe time would come, he added, when a drainage scheme would be urgently\r\nnecessary, and very costly.  The Council authorised the Sanitary and\r\nRiver Committees to expend a sum not exceeding 50 in obtaining levels and\r\nplans and other information required by Mr. Bazalgette, \"to assist him in\r\nthe preparation of his scheme for diverting the drainage from the river.\"\r\nOn October 17th Mr. Bazalgette's scheme was laid before the Council.  It\r\nprovided for two intercepting sewers, one for the higher and the other\r\nfor the lower parts of the city, both forming a junction on the opposite\r\nside of the river near Trowse Station, whence the sewage would be\r\nconveyed to a point on Mr. Harvey's estate at Crown Point, to the east of\r\nthe old Whitlingham Road.  The plan also comprised the completion of the\r\ndrainage of the western part of the city, then unconnected with the main\r\nsewers.  For the first part of the scheme 50,000 was required, and for\r\nthe latter 30,000.  On October 31st the Council adopted a recommendation\r\nof the Sanitary and River Committees, that it was desirable to try more\r\nfully the possibility of cleansing the river by flushing and sluicing or\r\notherwise before proceeding to carry out Mr. Bazalgette's report; that\r\nthe City Engineer be instructed accordingly; and that immediate steps be\r\ntaken to improve the drainage on the south side of the city, at a cost\r\nnot exceeding 10,000.  (_See_ April 21st, 1866.)\r\n\r\n15.--The first two-days' show of the Norfolk Agricultural Association\r\ncommenced in Chapel Field, Norwich.  The society's dinner was held at the\r\nRoyal Hotel, and was presided over by the Marquis Townshend.\r\n\r\n17.--Died at Elm Lodge, near Hampton, Lord Charles FitzRoy, second son of\r\nthe fourth Duke of Grafton.  His lordship was born on February 28th,\r\n1791, and married, in 1825, Anne, eldest daughter of George Augustus\r\nHenry, first Earl of Burlington.  Lord Charles was at the battle of\r\nCorunna, and served in the Walcheren Expedition with the Guards.  In 1811\r\nhe joined Lord Hill's staff, and was present at the siege and capture of\r\nBadajoz, and at the battles of Vittoria, Pyrenees, Nivelle, Nive, Othes,\r\nToulouse, and Waterloo, and received the war medal with eight clasps.\r\nFor two years he served with the army of occupation in France.  His\r\nlordship sat in Parliament, as member for Thetford, from 1818 till the\r\npassing of the Reform Bill, and at the General Election which ensued was\r\nelected for Bury, in the Liberal interest.  He was Vice-Chancellor of the\r\nHousehold from 1835 to 1839, and was also appointed a Privy Councillor.\r\nIn four successive Parliaments he represented Bury, and resigned his seat\r\nin 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--The 5.30 p.m. express from London to Norwich had a narrow escape.  On\r\nreaching a portion of the line near Harford Bridges, the engine, on\r\nrunning down the incline, left the metals, and, tearing up the permanent\r\nway for some distance, stopped on the wooden bridge which crosses the\r\nYare a little below Old Lakenham.  \"One of the carriages was overturned,\r\nand the occupants, among whom was Lord Stafford, had to make their escape\r\nby climbing through the windows which were then uppermost.\"  None of the\r\npassengers were seriously hurt.\r\n\r\n7.--At a Liberal meeting held at St. Andrew's Hall, Norwich, certain\r\naccusations founded upon letters received from Mr. John Bright, M.P.,\r\nwere made against Mr. Robert Edmond Chester Waters, one of the\r\nConservative candidates for the representation of the city.  The\r\nprincipal charges were that Mr. Waters (previously a Liberal) had been\r\ncompelled to resign his membership of the Reform Club for cheating at\r\ncards, and that while he came before the Norwich electors as a Protestant\r\nChurchman, in Rome he professed to be a Roman Catholic.  Mr. Waters\r\ndeclared these statements to be scandalous and false; and on the 8th\r\nannounced that he had authorised legal proceedings to be taken against\r\nSir William Foster and the Rev. George Gould for making imputations on\r\nhis personal character.  On the 10th a deputation, consisting of Messrs.\r\nH. S. Patteson, Edward Field, D. Dalrymple, and J. H. Tillett, proceeded\r\nto London to investigate at the Reform Club the truth of the allegations,\r\nand in the course of the day the following telegram was received\r\nsimultaneously by Sir Samuel Bignold and Sir William Foster: \"We have the\r\nminutes.  They have been produced before us, and we find that it is true\r\nthat Mr. Waters was accused of cheating at cards at the Reform Club, and\r\nunanimously called upon by the committee to resign to prevent expulsion,\r\nand further that he did, on receiving that communication, resign on the\r\n23rd November, 1860.\"  The telegram was dated from the Reform Club, and\r\nsigned by the deputation.  In consequence of the telegram, Messrs. Fred\r\nBrown, J. B. Morgan, F. E. Watson, and Henry Ling issued a notice stating\r\nthat they felt it their duty to withdraw their support from Mr. Waters as\r\none of the candidates for the city.  Mr. Waters thereupon stated that he\r\nwould stand independently.  The nomination took place at the Guildhall on\r\nthe 11th.  The other candidates were Sir William Russell and Mr. Edward\r\nWarner, Liberals; and Mr. Augustus Goldsmid, Conservative.  The polling\r\ntook place on the 12th, and was officially declared on the 13th, as\r\nfollows:--Russell, 1,845; Warner, 1,838; Goldsmid, 1,466; Waters, 1,363.\r\nMr. Waters, who was exceedingly popular with what the NORFOLK CHRONICLE\r\ndescribed as \"the lower order of Conservatives,\" made a return visit to\r\nNorwich on October 10th, and was escorted by a torchlight procession\r\nround the city.  Thirty thousand people assembled in the Market Place,\r\nthe bells of St. Peter Mancroft were rung, and the late candidate, after\r\nmaking a complimentary call upon Sir Samuel Bignold, proceeded to the\r\nNorfolk Hotel and addressed from the window a dense crowd assembled in\r\nSt. Giles' Street.  On the 11th he was entertained at dinner by the Eldon\r\nClub; and at St. Andrew's Hall, on the 12th, was received with the utmost\r\nenthusiasm by a crowded audience.  Mr. Waters, who was accompanied by\r\nLord Henry Thynne and Sir Alfred Slade, was presented with a massive\r\nsilver epergne, \"by a very large number of the Conservatives of Norwich,\r\nas an expression of their cordial sympathy and regard, and in\r\nappreciation of the gallant and chivalrous spirit in which, under\r\ndifficulties unprecedented, he fought the battle of the Conservative\r\ncause loyally, courteously, and fearlessly at the Parliamentary election\r\nfor Norwich, 1865.\"  A \"testimonial dinner\" was given to Mr. Waters at\r\nthe Norfolk Hotel on the evening of the 13th, when the Norwich\r\nConservative Association was inaugurated.  Upwards of 100 members were at\r\nonce enrolled, and on the 14th Sir Samuel Bignold, in response to the\r\nrequest of a deputation, accepted the presidency.\r\n\r\n8.--A meeting of the independent electors of East Norfolk was held at the\r\nSwan Hotel, Norwich, for the purpose of selecting a candidate to contest\r\nthe constituency in the interests of the supporters of the movement for\r\nthe repeal of the Malt Tax.  Mr. Clare Sewell Read, who had been for some\r\ntime prominently identified with the party in favour of the repeal, was\r\nunanimously chosen.  Mr. Jacob Henry Tillett attended the meeting and\r\nmade a remarkable speech.  If Mr. Read were nominated, he said, he would\r\nhelp him to the utmost of his power; and he added, \"If you want money, if\r\nyou want help, if you want what enthusiasm I can put into the cause, let\r\nyour chairman write to me and I will respond with all my heart.\"  The\r\nnomination took place at the Shirehall on the 15th.  Several times the\r\nproceedings were stayed and consultations held by the leaders of the\r\nrespective parties, with the view of effecting a compromise.  The\r\ncandidates nominated were Mr. Edward Howes, Sir Thomas Beauchamp, and\r\nCol. Coke.  Mr. Robert Leamon offered not to proceed with the nomination\r\nof Mr. Read if the Liberal party would pledge themselves to return to\r\nParliament a Malt Tax repealer; in the absence of that assurance he\r\nnominated Mr. Read, whose candidature was seconded by Mr. H. S. Grimmer.\r\nIt was subsequently agreed by the friends of Mr. Howes to permit the name\r\nof Mr. Read to appear upon the election cards and posters issued by the\r\nformer.  The poll was opened on the 18th, and was officially declared on\r\nthe 20th, as follows:--Howes, 3,100; Read, 2,985; Beauchamp, 2,150; Coke,\r\n1,994\r\n\r\n11.--The nomination of candidates for the representation of Yarmouth was\r\nheld at the Town Hall.

Alexander Hugh Baring and Mr. Robert John\r\nHarvey Harvey, Conservatives, and Mr. Thomas Dakin (Alderman of London\r\nand Sheriff of Middlesex), Liberal, were nominated to represent the\r\nborough.

Fowell Buxton, Liberal, were nominated for the representation of\r\nKing's Lynn.  The polling, on the 13th, resulted in the return of Lord\r\nStanley, 445 votes, and Sir T. Fowell Buxton, 401 votes.  Mr. Walpole\r\npolled 339 votes.\r\n\r\n--Died at Herne Bay, aged 43 years, Mr. Samuel Peckworth Woodward, Ph.D.,\r\nF.G.S., assistant in the Geological Department of the British Museum, and\r\nsecond son of Mr. Samuel Woodward, of Norwich.  He was a member of\r\nseveral learned societies, and in 1845 was appointed professor of botany\r\nand geology at the Royal Agricultural College.\r\n\r\n19.--The nomination of candidates for West Norfolk took place at\r\nSwaffham.  The Conservatives were Mr. William Bagge and the Hon. T. de\r\nGrey (the latter strongly opposed as \"an excessive game preserver\"); and\r\nthe Liberals, Sir Willoughby Jones, Bart. (Conservative member for\r\nCheltenham in 1847), and Mr. Brampton Gurdon.  The poll was opened on the\r\n22nd, and the following was the result: Bagge, 2,710; de Grey, 2,611;\r\nJones, 2,133; Gurdon, 2,088.  A petition against the return of the\r\nsuccessful candidates was dismissed, owing to informality in the\r\nrecognisances.  Great disturbances took place at Swaffham, for which\r\nseveral persons were punished at the ensuing Quarter Sessions.  Mr. de\r\nGrey, on his return to Merton, on the 24th, was most enthusiastically\r\nreceived at Watton and other places on the route.\r\n\r\n26.--The comic singer Vance--\"the Great Vance\"--made his first appearance\r\nin Norwich at St. Andrew's Hall.  \"He is the original singer of the\r\nabsurd 'Slap Bang,' and has better recommendations, but the judicious\r\nportion of the audience could not see enough in him to explain the great\r\nsuccess he has achieved in the Metropolis.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--A reminiscence of the old convict days was forthcoming in a case\r\ntried before Lord Chief Baron Pollock at the Norfolk Assizes.  Cornelius\r\nBradnum, a fruit dealer, was indicted for being feloniously and\r\nunlawfully at large at Heckingham on February 6th, 1865, \"he having been\r\ntransported for the term of his natural life, in pursuance of a certain\r\njudgment against him at the Norfolk Assizes on July 21st, 1847, on an\r\nindictment for burglary.\"  The prisoner, in his defence, made a\r\nremarkable statement, to the effect that in consequence of his having\r\ngiven information of an intended mutiny of the convicts at Gibraltar, his\r\nsentence was mitigated to fifteen years.  From Gibraltar he was sent to\r\nSwan River, Western Australia, where the Governor gave him his ticket of\r\nleave, and after \"serving his ticket\" he received a free pardon.  He then\r\nwent to Callao, in Peru.  One evening, when standing on the Mole, he was\r\nkidnapped, put upon an American ship, and brutally ill-used and crippled.\r\nSixty-five dollars had been paid for him, but as he was useless he was\r\nput ashore at Hamburgh, whence, after remaining some time in hospital, he\r\ncame to England.  Unfortunately, he had left at Callao the document\r\nconveying to him his free pardon.  The prosecution denied that a free\r\npardon had been granted.  His lordship said it was for the prosecution to\r\nshow that the prisoner's statement was untrue, after using that statement\r\nagainst him as evidence.  The statement must be taken as true until it\r\nwas contradicted.  It had not been contradicted, and, he added, turning\r\nto the jury, \"It is for you to say whether you believe it or not.  I must\r\nsay I don't see why you should not believe it, and why he is not entitled\r\nto a verdict of not guilty.\"  The jury acquitted the prisoner.\r\n\r\n5.--A large meeting of agriculturists was held at the Swan Hotel,\r\nNorwich, for the purpose of considering what steps should be taken to\r\ncombat \"a disease known as the Russian murrain, which had broken out\r\namong the cattle of Norfolk.\"  Mr. Clare Sewell Read, M.P., presided,\r\nand, in the course of the proceedings, alarming reports were given of the\r\nspread of the contagion and of the immediate steps that were necessary to\r\narrest its progress.  A deputation, consisting of Mr. Read, Mr. Steeds,\r\nMr. W. Smith, and Mr. R. Leamon, was appointed to wait upon the Home\r\nOffice, and at a committee meeting on the 9th Mr. Read reported what had\r\ntaken place.  It was resolved, on the motion of Sir Thomas Beauchamp, who\r\nheaded the list with a donation of 100, that a public subscription be\r\nopened at once, and Professor Simonds, in a long address, showed that the\r\ndisease was of foreign importation, and was known in Russia, whence it\r\ncame, as rinderpest.  At this meeting it was reported that in the\r\nneighbourhood of North Walsham alone losses to the extent of 1,000 and\r\nupwards had been sustained.  Isolation of the herds and the slaughter of\r\ndiseased animals were the means advocated for stamping out the murrain.\r\nA Norfolk Cattle Plague Association was at once formed, and at a large\r\nand influential meeting, held at St. Andrew's Hall on the 12th, under the\r\npresidency of Mr. Read, whose great services at this crisis were\r\nacknowledged by the Earl of Leicester, resolutions were adopted (1)\r\nrecommending to the consideration of the public the means suggested by\r\nProfessor Simonds for dealing with the disease, and urging that no farmer\r\nshould purchase any store stock in any market for the period of six\r\nweeks; (2) that a subscription be entered into for the purpose of meeting\r\nthe losses sustained by those who should conform to the resolutions drawn\r\nup by the committee, and for defraying the expenses incurred in carrying\r\nout the objects of the meeting; and (3) that no person who did not\r\nsubscribe to the amount of twopence in the pound on his assessment should\r\nparticipate in the relief.  At this meeting the Earl of Leicester\r\ncontributed a donation of 500.  Meetings of the Cattle Plague Association\r\nwere then held weekly, reports were presented upon the state of the\r\ndisease in various parts of the county, and matters of detail received\r\nattention.  On October 21st a public meeting was held at St. Andrew's\r\nHall, under the presidency of the Earl of Leicester, \"to consider the\r\ndesirability of closing all markets in the county of Norfolk.\"  Sir\r\nThomas Beauchamp moved, and the Earl of Albemarle seconded, a resolution\r\nin favour of the adoption of this course, which was agreed to.  During\r\nthis month Mr. Read was appointed a member of the Royal Commission to\r\ninquire into the causes of cattle plague and to suggest remedies.  The\r\nCommission recommended the slaughter of animals and the stringent\r\nprohibition of the passage of cattle across public roads, &c.  At Norwich\r\nand elsewhere there were frequent magisterial proceedings against dealers\r\nand others for contravention of the Orders of Council; medical men and\r\nveterinary surgeons suggested many remedies for the disease, and quacks\r\nadvertised their nostrums, but the end of the year found the fatal\r\nrinderpest more rampant than ever.  Science seemed confounded by the\r\ninsidious character of the outbreak, and precautionary measures appeared\r\nto be vain to prevent its extension.  It was officially announced that\r\nfrom September 6th to December 20th compensation had been given in\r\nrespect of 1,486 animals, to the amount of 9,448 3s. 11d.  (_See_\r\nFebruary 23rd, 1866.)\r\n\r\n8.--A barque named the Edgar, of 600 tons burthen, built by Messrs.\r\nFellows and Son, for the South American trade, was launched from their\r\nshipyard at Southtown, Great Yarmouth.\r\n\r\n11.--The Earl of Leicester issued to the tenants on his estate an\r\naddress, in which he referred to an election circular sent out to them\r\nduring his absence in Norway, the spirit of which he described as \"a\r\nflagrant contradiction of the principles and practices that have been\r\nprofessed and followed on the Holkham estate for nearly a century.\"  His\r\nlordship had counselled not coercion in any form, but the adoption of\r\nevery legitimate measure to achieve the return of Mr. Gurdon and Sir\r\nWilloughby Jones at the West Norfolk election; but the zeal of his agent\r\n(Mr. Shellabear) in carrying out instructions which were only indicated\r\nand not given in detail led him to issue a circular which had caused much\r\nscandal, the impolicy and unfittingness of which no one now saw more\r\nclearly than his lordship himself.\r\n\r\n12.--Died at Kew, Sir William Jackson Hooker, K.H., F.R.S., F.L.S., &c.,\r\nRegius Professor of Botany in the University of Glasgow.  Sir William was\r\na native of Norwich, where his father, Mr. Joseph Hooker, a manufacturer,\r\ntook much interest in horticulture, and possessed a rich collection of\r\nsucculent and other exotics.  Hooker spent some of his earlier years in\r\nthe study of agriculture with Mr. Robert Paul, of Starston Hall, but the\r\ndeath of a relative enabled him to devote himself to his favourite\r\npursuit, natural history.  With his brother, Mr. Joseph Hooker, the Rev.\r\nJames Brown, and other naturalists, he thoroughly explored the rich\r\ndistrict of the Norfolk Broads in the study of ornithology.  He was the\r\nauthor of several works, and editor of the \"Botanical Magazine.\"\r\nResigning the appointment of Regius Professor for the curatorship of the\r\nRoyal Gardens at Kew, he received the honour of knighthood in 1835, and\r\nin 1845 had conferred upon him the degree of D.C.L. by the University of\r\nOxford.  He married a daughter of Mr. Dawson Turner, of Yarmouth.  His\r\neldest son, Dr. Hooker, F.L.S., was no less distinguished than his father\r\nfor his valuable works in natural history and for the scientific\r\nexplorations with which his name was associated.\r\n\r\n13.--Died at Southwell, the Ven. Archdeacon Wilkins, D.D.  He was born at\r\nNorwich in 1785, and was the youngest son of Mr. William Wilkins, F.S.A.,\r\nand brother of the Professor of Architecture in the Royal Academy.\r\nEducated at the Grammar School, Bury St. Edmund's, under the\r\nheadmastership of Becher, he entered Caius College, Cambridge, in 1803,\r\nand having received his degree, removed to Oxford to prosecute his\r\nfavourite study of divinity.  He was ordained at Norwich in 1808, and was\r\nultimately presented to the vicarage of St. Mary's, Nottingham, where he\r\nministered single-handed to a population of 28,000.  He was the author of\r\n\"A History of the Destruction of Jerusalem,\" and of several other works.\r\n\r\n18.--A sculling match, known as the \"Great Lynn Sweepstakes,\" was\r\ncontested over the Ouse championship course in the Eau Brink Cut, a\r\ndistance of 3,300 yards.  The competitors were Robert Chambers, champion\r\nof the Tyne and ex-champion of the Thames; Harry Kelley, who just\r\npreviously had wrested the championship of the Thames from his formidable\r\nNorth country rival; and Robert Cooper, of Newcastle.  The sweepstakes\r\namounted to 50, with 100 added by the Lynn Regatta Committee.  The\r\nconditions provided that if three competed the winner should receive 200\r\nand the second man 50, and if only two came to the post a first prize of\r\n200 only would be given.  The race lay between Cooper and Kelley alone.\r\nThe former kept a slight lead, and as Kelley's efforts to pass him were\r\nunavailing, he rowed past the winning-post a quarter of a length ahead.\r\nThe referee decided that Kelley had won, disqualified Cooper on the\r\nground that he had taken the other man's water, and awarded second prize\r\nto Chambers.  At a meeting presided over by the Mayor of Lynn (Mr. W.\r\nMonement), a protest was lodged by Cooper's backers against the second\r\nprize being awarded to Chambers.  The Mayor decided to withhold the\r\nsecond prize until the referee had been communicated with, and handed to\r\nKelley a cheque for 200.  Cooper's protest was ultimately disallowed.\r\n\r\n26.--The 13th Hussars, with headquarters, arrived at Norwich Cavalry\r\nBarracks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.--A prize-fight took place on Grimstone Common, between Pooley Mace and\r\na man named Rackaby.  After five rounds had been contested, the police\r\nstopped hostilities, and Rackaby's party declining to resume the fight,\r\nthe stakes were awarded to Mace.\r\n\r\n30.--Died at Clive House, Beckenham, Kent, in his 71st year, Lieut.-Col.\r\nHenry Alexander, 96th Foot.

He received the war medal with\r\nsix clasps for Vittoria, Pyrenees, Nivelle, Nive, Orthes, and Toulouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--The first Church Congress commenced at Norwich.  The Congress sermon\r\nwas preached at the Cathedral by the Archbishop of York, and the first\r\ngeneral meeting was held at St. Andrew's Hall, presided over by the\r\nBishop of Norwich.  The final meeting took place on the afternoon of the\r\n5th, after which the members of Congress attended luncheon, given at the\r\nnew bank by Mr. R. J. H. Harvey, M.P.  Two thousand guests were present.\r\nOn the morning of the 6th, the Bishop of Oxford preached the annual\r\nsermon at the Cathedral on behalf of the Five Religious Societies.\r\n\r\n9.--Died at the house of Mrs. Church, Lady Lane, Norwich, Bartholomew\r\nGattey, \"the eccentric but clever flute-player at the Theatre Royal.\"\r\nFor forty years he had scarcely been absent from his place in the\r\norchestra of the theatres in the Norwich circuit, \"a position to which he\r\nfondly clung, in spite of many most favourable offers of engagement that\r\nwere made to him, and which, if accepted, would, no doubt, have resulted\r\nin his obtaining a position in the musical world of honour and emolument.\r\nAt length a mind never very strong gave way, and he was obliged to have\r\nrecourse to the assistance of his friends.  Mr. Hewlett and other\r\ngentlemen got up a concert for him in December, 1863, and 50 was\r\nrealised, which, with Mr. Gattey's simple habits, was sufficient for his\r\nmaintenance until his death.\"  He was a son of Mr. Gattey, a yarn\r\nmanufacturer, and a native of Norwich, and had attained his 64th year.\r\n\r\n14.*--\"Died at his residence, Bury St. Edmund's, Mr. Frederick Ladbrooke,\r\nportrait painter.  The deceased was the youngest son of the late Mr.\r\nRobert Ladbrooke, one of the founders of the celebrated Society of\r\nNorfolk and Norwich Artists.  He was a painter of considerable power.\"\r\n\r\n18.--The ceremony of cutting the first sod of the East Norfolk Railway\r\nwas performed on the estate of Mr. C. Jecks, Sheriff of Norwich, by Lady\r\nSuffield, in the presence of a large number of spectators.  In the\r\nevening a dinner, attended by representatives of most of the principal\r\nfamilies in the county, was held at St. Andrew's Hall, Norwich, in\r\ncelebration of the event.  Lord Suffield presided.  (_See_ August 13th,\r\n1870.)\r\n\r\n21.*--\"The Queen has been pleased to grant to Edward John Stracey, of\r\nSprowston, Lieut.-Colonel of the Scots Fusilier Guards, her Royal licence\r\nand authority that he and his issue may, in compliance with a clause\r\ncontained in the last will and testament of James Clitherow, take and use\r\nthe name of Clitherow in addition to that of Stracey.\"\r\n\r\n25.--A new lifeboat, named the James Pearce, was launched at Yarmouth.\r\nIt was built at the cost of 350, subscribed by the artisans of\r\nBirmingham, and presented through the Royal National Lifeboat Institution\r\nto the Caister station.\r\n\r\n30.--Died at Hilgay, aged 110 years (as was originally stated), Mr. John\r\nNaylor, formerly landlord of the Crown Hotel, Downham Market.  An amended\r\nnotice, published on November 18th, says: \"The late Mr. John Naylor, who\r\ndied on the 30th ult., and was supposed by his eldest son to be _only_\r\n110 years of age, appears from the parish register of Welney to be 117,\r\nhe having been born on the 29th of May, 1748.  In 1825 the deceased\r\nretired from his business as a publican, he having kept the Crown at\r\nDownham and the George and Dragon at Hilgay in succession, and had since\r\nlived on a small property of his own in the latter village.  He was\r\nalways a smart, active man, and constant in taking his walk up to\r\nOctober, 1860.  Since that time he had been confined to his house, but\r\nused to sit up in his chair for some portion of the day until June, 1864,\r\nwhen he did so for the last time.  His sight had failed him, but his\r\nhearing was so good that he could distinguish the voices of his friends,\r\nand he was rational until within six weeks of his death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--Died of apoplexy, at his residence, Acton Green, Middlesex, John\r\nLindley, F.R.S., Ph.D., and formerly Professor of Botany at University\r\nCollege.  He was born at Catton, near Norwich, in 1799, and was the son\r\nof a nurseryman.  His first literary effort, after devoting much of his\r\nearly youth to the practical details of botany, was the translation of\r\nRichard's \"Analyse de Fruit\" from the French, and the contribution of\r\nsome papers to the Transactions of the Linnaean Society.  Afterwards he\r\nproceeded to London, where he was engaged by Mr. Loudon to assist in the\r\nproduction of the \"Encyclopaedia of Plants.\"  In 1832 he published his\r\n\"Introduction to Systematic and Physiological Botany,\" but his _chef\r\nd'oeuvre_ was the \"Vegetable Kingdom.\"  For more than a quarter of a\r\ncentury Dr. Lindley filled the chair of Botany at University College,\r\nLondon, and in 1860 was appointed examiner in the University of London.\r\nHe was a member of several learned bodies, and edited the horticultural\r\ndepartment of the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" from its commencement in\r\nJanuary, 1841, to the time of his death.\r\n\r\n7.--Lord Hastings, master of the East Norfolk Foxhounds, was presented\r\nwith his portrait in oil, subscribed for by 400 gentlemen of the Hunt.\r\nThe portrait was painted by Mr. Eddis, and his lordship was depicted in\r\nhunting dress, mounted on Archer, his favourite hunter.  Sir Willoughby\r\nJones, Bart., made the presentation, on behalf of the subscribers.\r\n\r\n8.--The Marquis and Marchioness Townshend, whose marriage had taken place\r\na few weeks previously, were welcomed with great enthusiasm on their\r\nreturn to Rainham, and were presented by the tenantry with a handsome\r\nsilver epergne.\r\n\r\n9.--Mr. William Peter Nichols was elected Mayor, and Mr. William Jary\r\nCubitt appointed Sheriff of Norwich.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--Died at Necton Hall, Colonel William Mason.

Their Royal Highnesses travelled by\r\nspecial train from Wolferton to Lynn and thence to East Dereham, where\r\nthey were received by Lord Suffield, Viscount Hamilton, and the Hon.\r\nHarbord Harbord.  A guard of honour was formed by the 15th Norfolk\r\nVolunteer Company, under the command of Capt. Bulwer, and their Royal\r\nHighnesses, entering a carriage drawn by four greys, proceeded along\r\nNorwich Road and the Market Place.  Three triumphal arches were erected\r\nin the town, which was handsomely decorated, guns were fired, and the\r\nchurch bells rung, and in the evening there was a display of fireworks.\r\nAfter leaving Dereham, the Royal visitors proceeded by way of Swanton,\r\nBylaugh, and Bawdeswell to Reepham, where the Aylsham Volunteers,\r\ncommanded by Capt. Scott, provided a guard of honour.  At Aylsham their\r\nRoyal Highnesses were welcomed with great enthusiasm, and at Gunton Park\r\ngates the North Walsham corps, commanded by Major Duff, mounted a guard\r\nof honour.  On the 5th and 6th the Prince shot over the estate, and on\r\nthe evening of the last-named day a dinner and ball were given at the\r\nhall.  On the 7th his Royal Highness attended a meet of the East Norfolk\r\nFoxhounds, and on the 8th shot on the Hanworth side of the hall.  The\r\nvisit terminated on the 9th.  The Prince and Princess had arranged to\r\nhonour Lord Sondes by attending luncheon at Elmham Hall, but, owing to\r\nintelligence received of the critical condition of the King of the\r\nBelgians, the visit was postponed.  Their Royal Highnesses left Elmham\r\nstation by special train, and arrived at Sandringham the same afternoon.\r\n\r\n7.--The Rev. J. M.

T. de Grey,\r\narrived at Holkham, on a visit to the Earl and Countess of Leicester.\r\n\"Their Royal Highnesses _de facto_ opened the new line of the West\r\nNorfolk Junction Railway, which had been pushed forward by the contractor\r\nso as to be ready for the purpose.\"  It was by this line that the Prince\r\nand Princess travelled to Holkham.  Their Royal Highnesses returned to\r\nSandringham on the 13th.\r\n\r\n11.--The first wintry weather of the season was experienced on this date,\r\nwhen there was a considerable fall of snow, accompanied by showers of\r\nrain and sleet, followed by a sharp wind frost.  Telegraphic\r\ncommunication with London was suspended, in consequence of the blowing\r\ndown of several miles of the telegraph line.\r\n\r\n--Lost in the Bay of Biscay, by the wreck of the steamship London, on her\r\nvoyage to Australia, the Rev. John Woolley, D.C.L., formerly headmaster\r\nof Norwich Grammar School, Fellow of University College, Oxford, and\r\nprincipal and professor of classics and logic in the University of\r\nSydney.

It was\r\ndesigned by Mr. R. M. Phipson, of Norwich and Ipswich, and built by Mr.\r\nHall, of Pottergate Street, at the cost of 4,000.  It is now known as the\r\nNational Provincial Bank.\r\n\r\n--A vessel running through Yarmouth Roads was observed to be flying a\r\n\"waif.\"  Two lifeboats, the Rescuer, belonging to the Ranger Company, and\r\nthe Friend of All Nations, the property of the Young Company of Beachmen,\r\nput off to her assistance.

Hatton having refused to pay the\r\nChurch Rate, proceedings were taken in the Arches Court to enforce it.\r\nThe whole sum in dispute was 6s. 8d., but it had given rise to many\r\nmonths of litigation, to much unpleasantness and ill-feeling in the\r\nparish, and to rioting and disturbance.  Two objections were urged\r\nagainst the rate: (1) That proper notice had not been given on the church\r\ndoors, as provided by the Act of Parliament; and (2) that the rate was\r\nunequal and unjust.  The Court entered judgment for the churchwardens,\r\nand condemned the defendant in the costs of the protracted proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--Under the Prisons Act, 1865, the old borough jail at Lynn ceased to\r\nbe used as a prison.\r\n\r\n2.--Mr. F. W. Windham, who for five or six years had enjoyed unenviable\r\nnotoriety, died suddenly at the Norfolk Hotel, Norwich.  He had been\r\nunwell for several days, and was seen by his medical attendant, Mr. F. C.\r\nBailey, on January 31st.  Mr. Windham became better on February 1st, and\r\nstill further improvement was manifested on the 2nd; but later in the day\r\nhis symptoms were completely altered, and became so alarming that Mr.\r\nBailey called in Dr. Bateman and Dr. Eade.  Every effort was made to\r\nrestore animation, but without avail; this victim of an ill-spent life\r\ngradually sank, and in a few hours expired, in the presence of the\r\nmedical men and of some of the servants of the hotel.  Death was due to\r\nthe obstruction of the circulation by a clot of blood in the pulmonary\r\nartery.  On the 7th the body was removed to Tucker's Hotel, Cromer, and\r\nthe interment took place on the 8th, in the family vault at Felbrigg.\r\nMr. Windham had completely dissipated the residue of the extensive\r\nproperty which he inherited, after payment of the law expenses contingent\r\non the great suit, Windham _v._ Windham (_q.v._ November 22nd, 1861), and\r\nbecame dependent for a livelihood on the little income he made as driver\r\nof the Cromer coach.  His uncle, General Windham, had made arrangements\r\nby which he was supplied with the means of living respectably.  He had\r\nrooms at the Norfolk Hotel, but generally spent his time in one or other\r\nof the low public-houses in the city.  The effect of his death was to\r\ndeprive Mrs. Windham of the annuity granted on Mr. Windham's life, and of\r\nany interest whatever in the Hanworth estate.\r\n\r\n16.--A case was heard at East Dereham Petty Sessions, in which the points\r\nurged in the Corn Hall litigation in 1857-58 were again brought\r\nprominently before the public.  George Squire, a Lincolnshire merchant,\r\nwas charged with assaulting Charles Howard, the keeper of the Corn Hall.\r\nHe had paid twopence for admission, and Howard informed him that he ought\r\nto take a merchant's ticket and hire a stand.  In the course of the\r\naltercation, defendant took plaintiff by the collar and pinched his neck.\r\nMr. J. C. Chittock, solicitor, on behalf of the defendant, contended that\r\nany person had a right to go into the hall, whether he paid for doing so\r\nor not, because at the Summer Assizes in 1857 the proprietors were\r\nindicted for obstructing a highway and a verdict was given for the Crown.\r\nThe hall was built upon a highway known as Lion Hill, and Lion Hill had\r\nnever ceased to be a highway.  The Bench determined that they had no\r\njurisdiction, and dismissed the case.\r\n\r\n18.--Died at Great Yarmouth, Mr. Isaac Preston, aged 92 years.  One of\r\nthe oldest inhabitants of the borough, he had, previous to the passing of\r\nthe Municipal Reform Act, held several important offices in connection\r\nwith the Corporation, and was twice Mayor.  He was a justice of the peace\r\nand a deputy-lieutenant for the county, and was one of the promoters of\r\nthe movement for the erection of the Nelson Column on the South Denes.\r\n\r\n23.--A serious difficulty arose at Norwich, owing to the operation of the\r\nCattle Diseases Prevention Act.  A large number of dealers, apprehending\r\nthat the provisions of the Act would not be enforced until the following\r\nweek, sent stock to Norwich for the market on the 24th, or for\r\ntransmission by rail to London.  Two hundred fat beasts arrived at Trowse\r\nfor conveyance, but the railway authorities refused to receive them.\r\nSalesmen on the Hill experienced the same difficulty, and dealers had to\r\ndispose of their cattle as best they could.  Many beasts were sent to\r\nbutchers for immediate slaughter; others were removed to Trowse.  The\r\nMayor (Mr. Nichols) went down on the 25th to see what help he could\r\nrender, but the only way out of the difficulty was to send the animals to\r\nthe Norwich slaughter-houses, whence the principal portion of the meat\r\nwas forwarded to London.  In order to obviate any further difficulty of\r\nthe kind, the Norwich Town Council, on the 27th, resolved to erect\r\nslaughter-houses and to provide a dead meat market.  The cattle plague\r\ncontinued with unabated virulence.  Thursday, March 8th, was observed as\r\na day of humiliation, business was suspended, and special services were\r\nheld at the Cathedral and the parish churches.  Similar services took\r\nplace throughout the county.  On June 30th it was announced, \"Rinderpest\r\nis now nearly extinct in Norfolk and Suffolk\"; and on October 13th it was\r\nstated: \"The non-existence of the cattle plague in the county has\r\nrendered the work of the Central Committee and the Cattle Plague\r\nAssociation very light.\"  Norwich Cattle Market was re-opened on November\r\n17th.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.--A dastardly attempt was made to destroy the church of St. Lawrence,\r\nNorwich.  Mr. David Penrice, the churchwarden, accompanied by a lad, went\r\nto prepare the church for evening service, and found it to be full of\r\ngas.  The lad, on endeavouring to open the windows, was overcome by the\r\nfumes.  Assistance was obtained, and it was discovered that every burner\r\nin the church had been fully turned on.  At the Police Court, on the\r\n21st, a lad named George Nobbs, described as a shoemaker, of St.\r\nMartin-at-Oak, was charged with \"wilfully and maliciously turning on the\r\ngas at St. Lawrence' church, thereby endangering the lives of her\r\nMajesty's subjects.\"  The offence was fully proved, but the magistrates\r\ndismissed the case, on the ground that \"the lad did not show he had any\r\nknowledge of the consequences of the act.\"\r\n\r\n13.--A boiler explosion occurred at the brewery of Messrs. Arnold and\r\nWyatt, St. Margaret's Plain, Norwich.  William Whitworth, an engine\r\ndriver, was killed, \"his body being hurled into the beck containing six\r\nquarters of boiling wort.\"\r\n\r\n20.--The hearing of the petition against the return of Sir E. H. K. Lacon\r\nand Mr. J. Goodson commenced, before a Committee of the House of Commons.\r\nBribery, undue influence, and treating were alleged.  The inquiry\r\nconcluded on the 22nd, when the chairman (the Right Hon. J. R. Mowbray)\r\nannounced that the Committee had arrived at the unanimous conclusion that\r\nthe members had been duly elected.  On April 12th Mr. Mowbray gave notice\r\nof his intention to move the appointment of a Royal Commission \"to\r\ninquire into the corrupt practices which prevailed at the last election\r\nfor Great Yarmouth.\"  The Commissioners, Mr. Wyndham Slade, Mr. Lucius\r\nHenry Fitzgerald, and Mr. George Russell, began their sittings at the\r\nTown Hall on August 16th, and on September 11th adjourned until October\r\n3rd, on which day the proceedings recommenced.  The final adjournment\r\ntook place on October 15th, the thirty-fourth day of the inquiry.  Six\r\nhundred and fifty-six witnesses were examined, and full investigations\r\nmade as to the elections of 1865, 1859, and 1857.  The Commissioners\r\nreported that corrupt and illegal practices extensively prevailed, and in\r\nconsequence the borough was disfranchised.\r\n\r\n27.--The 13th Hussars marched from Norwich, _en route_ to Newcastle.\r\n\r\n28.--In the course of a civil action, Creake _v._ Smith, at the Norfolk\r\nAssizes, before Mr. Baron Martin, reference was made to \"the science of\r\nBibliomancy,\" as practised by a \"cunning woman\" in the neighbourhood of\r\nWells-next-the-Sea.  The defendant, who was landlord of the Railway Hotel\r\nat Wells, had lost articles from his house, and had consulted the woman\r\nwith the view of discovering the thief.  A Bible was suspended by a\r\nstring and made to revolve; during its revolutions the names of several\r\nsuspected persons were called out, and it was alleged that it stopped on\r\nthe name of the plaintiff being mentioned--a clear proof that he was the\r\nguilty person.  The defendant returned to the hotel, alleged that Creake\r\nwas a thief, \"for he knew it by the turn of the Bible,\" and dismissed him\r\nfrom his service.  Hence these legal proceedings for slander and wrongful\r\ndismissal, which resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff on the first\r\ncount, and for the defendant on the second count.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--Loveday's English Grand Opera Company commenced an engagement at\r\nNorwich Theatre.  The principals included Madame Florence Lancia, Mdlle.\r\nElla Miraldi, Miss Annie Leng, Miss Fanny Leng, Mr. Brookhouse Bowler,\r\nMr. Grantham, Mr. Oliver Summers, and Mr. Henry Rowland.  The repertory\r\nincluded \"La Somnambula,\" \"Il Trovatore,\" \"Don Giovanni,\" \"Faust,\"\r\n\"Dinorah,\" \"Der Frieschutz,\" \"Lucrezia Borgia,\" \"Norma,\" and \"Satanella.\"\r\n\r\n3.--Died at Hethel Hall, John Davy Brett, formerly major in the 17th\r\nLancers, and lieut.-colonel of the 1st Norfolk Battalion of Volunteers,\r\naged 51.\r\n\r\n5.--The marriage of the Right Hon.

It is known as 'the\r\ndodder.'  It completely absorbs or destroys the crop wherever it appears,\r\nand leaves the land barren of all but its own hair-like fibres.

Clabburn and the other promoters of\r\nthe injunction be earnestly entreated not to interpose any obstacle to\r\nthe Board's compliance with this request.\"  The \"injunctionists,\" on\r\nMarch 2nd, received a deputation appointed by the meeting, and, after\r\nhearing their statements, Dr. Dalrymple replied on behalf of the relators\r\nin the suit that they were of opinion \"the question of proceeding with\r\nthe scheme of drainage did not rest with them but with the Town Council,\r\nand they were not prepared to take any steps which would prejudice their\r\nlegal position for enforcing the purification of the river.\"  On March\r\n10th a memorial was presented to the Town Council, urging that the\r\ndrainage scheme in the then perplexity of sanitary science was \"a\r\nspeculation with the health of the city,\" and that it was \"stark madness\r\nto plunge into a gulf of unplumbed expenditure unwarned by the failures\r\nin other cities.\"  A motion was adopted authorising the Sewerage and\r\nIrrigation Committee to negotiate for a loan not exceeding 60,000,\r\nrequired for the construction of sewerage works.  On the 17th a band\r\nparaded the city to attract the citizens to a common hall, at which\r\nresolutions were adopted affirming that the rates were too high and the\r\ntrade of Norwich too depressed to warrant this costly experiment in\r\ndrainage.  The Town Council, on April 7th, entered into a contract with\r\nMessrs. Shrimpton and Co., of Uxbridge Road, London, for the construction\r\nof certain sewerage works, at the cost of 28,874; and it was agreed to\r\ntake up at interest of the Hand-in-Hand Fire and Life Office the sum of\r\n30,000, of which 20,000 was to be paid as soon as the necessary security\r\nwas prepared, and the remaining 10,000 at the expiration of six months,\r\nat the rate of 4 15s. per cent. per annum.

Mr. Evans married in 1829 Emily, daughter of Mr. George Morse, of\r\nCatton, by whom he left eight children--five sons and three daughters.\r\n\r\n31.--The Earl of Leicester presided at a meeting of the inhabitants of\r\nthe county and city, held at St. Andrew's Hall, Norwich, \"for the purpose\r\nof bringing the affairs of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital before the\r\npublic.\"  Resolutions were adopted affirming that the resources of the\r\ninstitution were inadequate to meet the annual expenditure, and as a\r\nmeans of increasing the revenue it was desirable \"that on one Sunday at\r\nleast in every year, as far as possible on the same Sunday, collections\r\nbe made for the benefit of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital in places of\r\nworship throughout the diocese, where such collections shall not\r\ninterfere with the claims of other hospitals.\"  As the resources of the\r\nHospital were heavily drawn upon by casualty cases, a separate fund\r\ncalled the Accident Fund was established.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.--Mr. Edward Kerrison Harvey was elected Mayor and Mr. John Robison\r\nappointed Sheriff of Norwich.\r\n\r\n15.--For the second time since its erection in 1857-8, the Britannia pier\r\nat Yarmouth was partially destroyed.  Built at the cost of 6,000, it was\r\noriginally 750 feet in length.  On October 25th, 1859, during a\r\ntremendous gale, a sloop, driven from her anchors, was dashed upon the\r\npier and divided it into two portions.  It was deemed advisable not to\r\nrebuild the severed portion, 80 feet in length, and the terminal portion\r\nwas subsequently removed.  During a heavy north-east gale on this date\r\nthe schooner Seagull, of Lynn, parted from her anchors, and, drifting\r\ntowards land, struck against the north side of the pier.  The crew of six\r\nhands speedily scrambled upon the structure and escaped, but about 105\r\nfeet of the centre portion of the pier was completely torn away and\r\ndamage done to the amount of nearly 1,000.\r\n\r\n16.--The nomination of candidates for Norwich, to be elected under the\r\nnew Reform Act, took place at the Guildhall.  The Liberal candidates were\r\nCol. Sir William Russell, Bart., C.B., Charlton Park, Charlton Kings,\r\nGloucester, and Mr. Jacob Henry Tillett; and the Conservative candidates\r\nSir Henry Josias Stracey, Bart., of Rackheath, who had been selected\r\nabout a fortnight previously.  The show of hands was in favour of the\r\nLiberals, and Sir Samuel Bignold demanded a poll, which was opened on the\r\n17th \"at 29 polling places most conveniently arranged in the different\r\nwards.\"  The pronouncement of the electorate at this election was upon\r\nthe Irish Church, and at Norwich, as elsewhere, a severe contest\r\nresulted.  The poll closed at four o'clock with the return of Sir William\r\nRussell and Sir Henry Stracey, the figures being officially declared on\r\nthe 18th as follow:--Stracey, 4,521; Russell, 4,509; Tillett, 4,364.  Sir\r\nHenry Stracey, accompanied by Lady Stracey, on the morning of the 18th\r\nwas escorted from Rackheath Park to Norwich, by his mounted tenantry, and\r\nreceived at Magdalene Gates by an imposing procession of Conservative\r\nelectors, who, amid the playing of brass bands and the ringing of St.\r\nPeter Mancroft bells, accompanied him to the Guildhall.  After the\r\ndeclaration the procession, half a mile in length, marched through the\r\ncity.  Mr. Tillett, in an address to the electors, stated: \"The Tory\r\nparty have, beyond all precedent, and in the most undisguised manner,\r\ncommitted themselves to the disgrace involved in the wholesale purchase\r\nof votes.\"  (_See_ January 14th, 1869.)\r\n\r\n16.--The nomination of representatives to serve in Parliament for the\r\nWestern Division of the county took place at Swaffham, when Sir William\r\nBagge, Bart., and the Hon. Thomas de Grey were re-elected without\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\n17.--The nomination of candidates for the borough took place at King's\r\nLynn.  Lord Stanley and the Hon. Robert Bourke were nominated by the\r\nConservatives, and Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, Bart., by the Liberals.  The\r\npoll was opened on the 18th, and resulted as follows:--Stanley, 1,265;\r\nBourke, 1,125; Buxton, 1,012.  (_See_ March 16th, 1869.)\r\n\r\n--Died at his residence, Surrey Street, Norwich, in his 82nd year, Mr.\r\nThomas Brightwell.  A native of Ipswich, he married the only daughter of\r\nMr. W. M. Wilkin, of Costessey, and settled in Norwich, where he resided\r\nfor 60 years, and practised as a solicitor.  An earnest Nonconformist, he\r\njoined the congregation which assembled at the Old Meeting in St.\r\nClement's, where to the close of his life he officiated as one of the\r\ndeacons.  He was the author of a work on the Pentateuch, and his\r\nintellectual attainments and scientific pursuits gained him admission\r\ninto the circle which included William Taylor, Doctors Sayers, Martineau,\r\nRigby, and Barrow, Sir James Smith, and other Norwich celebrities.  Men\r\nbearing historic names, and of widely different sentiments, had from time\r\nto time been entertained beneath his roof--Williams, Dr. Gary, Moffat,\r\nDoctors Philip and Wolff, of missionary fame; Joseph Kinghorn, the\r\neloquent Irving, Belzoni, the Egyptian explorer; Professor Sedgwick,\r\nGeorge Borrow, and many others who had done good service in the cause of\r\nreligion, literature, and science.  A close observer of nature, Mr.\r\nBrightwell gave much of his time to entomology, and a fine collection of\r\ninsects in the Norfolk and Norwich Museum was formed by him.  But the\r\nstudy to which, in his later years, he devoted especial attention was\r\nthat of Infusoria.  A treatise upon Infusoria, illustrated from drawings\r\nby his daughter, was written by Mr. Brightwell and printed for private\r\ncirculation.  At the Norwich Congress of the British Association, of\r\nwhich he was a vice-president, he was greatly amused by the anxious and\r\nineffectual endeavours made by several of the scientific men present to\r\nprocure copies of the work, then out of print.  In 1821 Mr. Brightwell\r\nbecame a Fellow of the Linnaean Society, and he also rendered\r\nconsiderable assistance in the formation of the Norfolk and Norwich\r\nLiterary Institution and of the Norfolk and Norwich Museum.\r\n\r\n21.--The nomination of candidates for South Norfolk took place at the\r\nShirehall, Norwich.  The Conservative candidates were Mr. Edward Howes,\r\nof Morningthorpe, and Mr. Clare Sewell Read, of Honingham Thorpe.  Mr.\r\nHenry Lombard Hudson, of Harleston, was nominated by the Liberals.  The\r\npolling, on the 24th, resulted as follows: Read, 3,097; Howes, 3,055;\r\nHudson, 1,679.\r\n\r\n23.--The following gentlemen were nominated at Aylsham to contest the new\r\nconstituency of North Norfolk:--Sir Edmund Knowles Lacon, Bart., and the\r\nHon. Frederick Walpole, Conservatives; Mr. Edward Robert Wodehouse and\r\nMr. Robert T. Gurdon, Liberals.  The polling took place on the 26th, at\r\nnine polling-places--Aylsham, Cromer, Holt, North Walsham, Ormesby,\r\nReepham, Stalham, Wells, and Yarmouth.  The official declaration was made\r\nat Aylsham on the 28th, as follows:--Walpole, 2,630; Lacon, 2,563;\r\nWodehouse, 2,235; Gurdon, 2,078.  (_See_ May 17th, 1869.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n19.*--\"A club bearing the name of the Norwich Football Club has been\r\nstarted, and has already begun to play upon the Norfolk and Norwich\r\nCricket Ground.  Mr. Croker has been elected president, and Mr. Edward A.\r\nField treasurer and secretary.\"  The members made their public _debut_ on\r\nFebruary 5th, 1869, in a match against King Edward VI. School.  (This is\r\nthe first reference to football, as distinct from the old game of camp\r\nball, made in the columns of the NORFOLK CHRONICLE.)\r\n\r\n26.--The pantomime produced at Norwich Theatre was entitled \"The White\r\nFawn, or the Loves of Buttercup and Daisy and the Fairies of the Coral\r\nLake.\"  At Wombwell's Menagerie (then owned by Mr. Fairgrieve, of\r\nEdinburgh) was exhibited, \"Prince Bonta Workey, son of the late King\r\nTheodore, who held levees in his grand state saloon at stated intervals\r\nduring the day.\"\r\n\r\n--Died at his residence, Chapel Field Road, Norwich, Mr. Trivet Allcock,\r\nin his 80th year.  \"He was an active politician and staunch Liberal, and\r\nhad associated in his earlier life with men like William Taylor and\r\nothers, whose superior learning formerly made Norwich celebrated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1869.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--At the justices' room of the Mansion House, London, John Henry\r\nGurney, Henry Edmund Gurney, Robert Birkbeck, Henry Ford Barclay, Henry\r\nGeorge Gordon, and William Rennie, directors of Overend, Gurney, and\r\nCompany, Limited, were summoned for having, in July, 1865, and at divers\r\nother times, conspired to defraud Dr. Adam Thom and others who became\r\nshareholders in the company, of money to the amount of three millions\r\nsterling.  The defendants, on the 27th, were committed for trial, and\r\nwere admitted to bail, each of them in the sum of 10,000, with two\r\nsureties of 5,000 each.  The trial commenced in the Court of Queen's\r\nBench on December 13th, before the Lord Chief Justice, who summed up on\r\nDecember 22nd, and the jury, after a few minutes' deliberation, returned\r\na verdict of not guilty.  Intense excitement prevailed in Norwich during\r\nthe trial, and on December 22nd, when the result was telegraphed to the\r\ncity, it was everywhere hailed with great satisfaction.  A remarkable\r\nscene occurred at Norwich Corn Hall, where a sale was in progress when\r\nthe intelligence was received.  The proceedings were stopped by cheering,\r\nthe waving of hats, and other demonstrations of approval, and the\r\nauctioneer, addressing the company, said, \"The name of Gurney was an\r\nhonoured name in Norwich.  The Gurneys had ever been friends of the poor\r\nand kind and good to all classes, and all were glad that the trial had\r\nresulted in the honourable acquittal of all the defendants.\"\r\n\r\n2.--At the Lambeth Police Court, William Sheward, aged 57, was charged\r\nupon his own confession with the wilful murder of his wife, Martha\r\nSheward, at Norwich, on June 15th, 1851.  On the night of January 1st the\r\nprisoner went to the Carter Street Police Station and said to the officer\r\nin charge, \"I have killed my wife.  I have kept the secret for years, but\r\nI can keep it no longer.\"  In a further statement he said he had intended\r\nto destroy himself, \"but the Almighty would not let him do it.\"  He added\r\nthat he had cut up his wife's body, and that a portion was kept in\r\nspirits of wine at the Guildhall at Norwich, by order of the magistrates.\r\nAt the Norwich Police Court, on January 4th, the Chief Constable (Mr.\r\nHitchman) detailed to the magistrates the particulars reported to him by\r\nthe London police, and stated that on June 21st, 1851, portions of a\r\nhuman body were found in different parts of the city and deposited at the\r\nGuildhall.  The magistrates issued a warrant for the apprehension of\r\nSheward, who, on January 7th, was brought to Norwich, and appeared before\r\nthe Bench on January 8th.  He was described as a licensed victualler, of\r\nthe Key and Castle public-house, St. Martin-at-Oak, and it was proved\r\nthat he married his first wife, a Norfolk woman, who formerly lived at\r\nWymondham, at Greenwich, on October 28th, 1836.  In 1838 he came to\r\nNorwich, opened a pawnbroker's shop in St. Giles', and became bankrupt.\r\nWhen living in Tabernacle Street, in 1851, his wife suddenly disappeared,\r\nabout the 9th or 10th of June.  Upon this evidence the prisoner was\r\nremanded, and at subsequent hearings witnesses were called who deposed to\r\nfinding various portions of human remains in different parts of the city\r\nand suburbs in the summer of 1851.  Relatives of the deceased woman\r\nstated that the prisoner accounted for her disappearance by saying that\r\nshe had left Norwich for a time.  On February 1st the prisoner was fully\r\ncommitted for trial.  At the Norwich Assizes, on March 29th, before Mr.\r\nBaron Pigott, Sheward was placed upon his trial, and on the second day of\r\nthe hearing Mr. Metcalfe, Q.C., for the defence, contended that the\r\naccused was labouring under delusions when he made the confession.  The\r\njury, after three-quarters of an hour private deliberation, returned a\r\nverdict of guilty, and the prisoner, who had nothing to say, was\r\nsentenced to death.  Immediately after the trial anonymous letters were\r\npublished in the London newspapers asserting the innocence of the\r\nprisoner; similar letters were addressed to the Magistrates' Clerk at\r\nNorwich, and one communication actually purported to have been written by\r\nMrs. Sheward herself.  Efforts were made to obtain a commutation of\r\nsentence, on the ground of the long interval that had elapsed between the\r\nperpetration of the murder and the trial of the accused.  These efforts,\r\nhowever, were of no avail, and the capital sentence was carried out by\r\nCalcraft at the City Gaol on April 20th.  This was the first private\r\nexecution that had taken place in Norwich.  It was announced that on\r\nApril 13th the culprit made a full confession of his crime, and gave\r\ndetailed particulars of the manner in which he had disposed of the body\r\nof the murdered woman.  In a letter to his second wife he also admitted\r\nhis guilt.\r\n\r\n14.--The trial of the election petition presented by Mr. Jacob Henry\r\nTillett against the return of Sir Henry Josias Stracey, Bart., as member\r\nof Parliament for Norwich, commenced at the Shirehall, before Mr. Baron\r\nMartin.  Counsel for the petitioner were Mr. Serjeant Ballantyne, Mr.\r\nKeane, Q.C., and Mr. Simms Reeve; and for the respondent, Mr. Rodwell,\r\nQ.C., Mr. Serjeant Sleigh, Mr. E. L. O'Malley, and Mr. J. C. C. Wyld.\r\nBribery, treating, personation, and other matters were alleged.  In his\r\nopening address, Mr. Ballantyne asserted \"that the bribery was most\r\nprofligate and most wholesale, and that houses were opened by persons of\r\napparent respectability for the mere purpose of carrying out this\r\nbribery, and men of position who ought to have known a great deal better\r\nwere concerned in it.\"  After three days' hearing, the trial resulted in\r\nthe unseating of Sir Henry Stracey.  The learned judge, in his report to\r\nthe Speaker of the House of Commons, stated that although no corrupt\r\npractice was proved to have been made with the knowledge or consent of\r\nany of the candidates, and, further, it was proved to his entire\r\nsatisfaction that neither Sir Henry Stracey nor the other candidates at\r\nthe said election had any personal knowledge of or connection whatever\r\nwith bribery or any other illegal or corrupt practice, he had determined\r\nthat Sir Henry Stracey was not duly elected, and that his election was\r\nrendered void by the acts of his agents.  The persons reported for being\r\nguilty of corrupt practices were Robert Hardiment, Arthur Hunt, Robert\r\nCallow, and Thomas Hutchings.  The first-named absconded after the\r\npetition was presented.  It was also stated in the report that a number\r\nof persons went to the poll in a gross state of drunkenness.  (_See_\r\nApril 1st.)\r\n\r\n15.--A trout weighing 15 lbs. was captured in a drop net near the New\r\nMills, Norwich.\r\n\r\n16.--Messrs. Jolly and Son, coachbuilders, Norwich, advertised that they\r\nhad \"arranged to supply from a noted French maker the celebrated bicycle\r\nvelocipede, so much in vogue in Paris.\"  The price of the machine was\r\nfrom 8 gs. upwards.  On the 30th there was an editorial announcement to\r\nthe effect that \"an attempt is being made to introduce this latest\r\nnovelty in locomotive machinery, now so fashionable in Paris, to the\r\nNorwich public, by Mr. C. Thorn, who has two at his establishment, for\r\nthe inspection of the curious.\"  The \"first velocipede journey of any\r\nconsiderable distance from Norwich\" was performed on March 30th by Mr. B.\r\nW. Jolly, who travelled from Norwich to Yarmouth, including a stoppage of\r\nfifteen minutes at Acle, in 2 hours 30 minutes.  \"The progress of the\r\ntraveller was considerably retarded by the roughness of the roads and a\r\npowerful gale.\"  A short time previously Mr. G. W. Bellamy, of\r\nSaxlingham, on a velocipede built by Messrs. Jolly and Son, but under\r\nmuch more favourable conditions as to roads and weather, accomplished a\r\ndistance of 56 miles in 6 hours 25 minutes, exclusive of a short delay\r\nmidway on the journey.  A Norwich Velocipede Club was established in the\r\nmonth of April, and on the 29th an exhibition of the machines was held at\r\nthe Corn Hall, under the management of Mr. Thorn.  On the same occasion\r\nwas exhibited \"one of the old-fashioned dandy horses, the original or the\r\nvelocipede tribe,\" but, it was added, \"the now velocipede is more easily\r\nmanaged.\"  The first velocipede races took place at the athletic sports\r\nof the Norwich Gymnastic Society, held on Newmarket Road Cricket Ground,\r\non May 24th.  A \"slow race,\" ridden by Messrs. Jolly, Griffiths, and\r\nGoldsmith, was won by the last-named.  A \"plank race,\" in which the\r\nbicycles were ridden upon a seventy yards' length of plank, was won by a\r\ncompetitor named Ewing.  A one mile \"fast race\" was ridden in heats, the\r\nfirst of which was won by Kent, of Beccles, and the second by Bellamy.\r\nKent was the winner of the final heat, in 4 minutes 49 seconds.  \"He came\r\nover on his bicycle from Beccles in the morning, and returned the same\r\nway after the sports.\"  By the end of the year there was a marked\r\nincrease in the number of local cyclists.  Accidents to inexperienced\r\nriders were frequently recorded, and many complaints were made by drivers\r\nof the alarm occasioned to horses by the appearance of these new-fangled\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\n16.--The so-called monastic chapel erected at Elm Hill, Norwich, by\r\nFather Ignatius, was the subject of further discussion.  Miss Robinson, a\r\n\"lady preacher,\" had hired the \"monastery,\" and named it the \"Jehovah\r\nJireh chapel,\" whereupon Ignatius issued a notice warning her and others\r\nconcerned that he was the owner of the building.  On this date \"Brother\r\nPhilip\" and one or two other members of the confraternity came to\r\nNorwich, under instructions from Ignatius, and demanded the keys of the\r\nbuilding from Mr. Liddlelow, who refused to give them up unless\r\nauthorised by his principal, Mr. Backhouse, surveyor, of Ipswich.  At\r\nmidnight on the 18th Ignatius, who had arrived in Norwich a few hours\r\npreviously, with other brethren, gained access to the old sanctuary by,\r\nthey asserted, miraculous intervention, and thence made their way to the\r\nnew chapel.  The police were sent for, and Ignatius was informed that he\r\nhad no right there; as he declined to leave the building, the police\r\nrefused to interfere.  Mr. Liddlelow, on the 19th, applied to the\r\nmagistrates for an order of ejectment, but as a question of right was\r\ninvolved, they would have nothing to do with the matter.  On the same\r\nevening Ignatius performed service in the chapel, and stated, in the\r\ncourse of his address, that Miss Robinson had acted in the most\r\nhonourable manner, but had been misled by others.  He alluded to her as\r\nhis \"sister in Christ,\" and Miss Robinson, who preached in the chapel on\r\nthe evening of the 20th, spoke of Ignatius as her \"brother in Christ.\"\r\nIgnatius addressed the congregation at the close of the proceedings, and\r\ninformed them that he should never allow the chapel to be used for any\r\nother purpose than that of monastic worship.  \"Although the members of\r\nFather Ignatius' congregation and the members of Miss Robinson's flock\r\ncould not be more opposed in their mode of thought, yet the greatest\r\nharmony prevailed, and at the close they offered up the Lord's Prayer in\r\nperfect unison.\"\r\n\r\n18.--The new Cemetery at Diss was consecrated by the Bishop of Norwich.\r\nThe total cost of the chapels, lodge, &c., was about 1,750, but this sum\r\nwas exclusive of the price of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--Died, in his 87th year, at Norwich, Thomas Hurry, church bell-hanger,\r\nand for more than 50 years a member of the St. Peter Mancroft company of\r\nringers.\r\n\r\n12.--A severe gale occurred on the Norfolk coast.  The barque Try Again\r\nwas lost off Yarmouth, and the crew saved by means of the rocket\r\napparatus.  Other vessels were wrecked, and several lives lost.\r\n\r\n13.*--\"We are sorry to learn that the Norfolk County Cricket Club has\r\nbeen brought to an untimely end.  The officers of the club hold out no\r\nhope that it can be carried on, as the persistent apathy of those who\r\ncall themselves members, many of whom have failed to pay their\r\nsubscriptions, has left the treasurer with a large amount of debts and no\r\nhope of being able to meet them.\"  At a meeting held on the 17th, it was\r\nagreed by the Dereham Cricket Club to hire the ground hitherto let to the\r\nCounty Cricket Club.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--At a meeting of the Norwich Town Council, a report was received from\r\nthe Sewerage and Irrigation Committee, stating that an intimation had\r\nbeen made by the contractor for the construction of the intercepting\r\nsewers that he would be unable to proceed with his contract unless the\r\nCommittee advanced him a sum of money.  As neither the Committee nor the\r\nBoard of Health had power to do so under the contract, proposals were\r\nmade to the contractor (Mr. Wainwright), which resulted in the Committee\r\ntaking possession of the works, materials, &c.  The opinion was expressed\r\nthat the Committee had acted with due consideration of the interests and\r\nsafety of the public, and at the same time with consideration for the\r\ncontractor, who appeared to have met with unforeseen difficulties in the\r\nprosecution of that part of the works in course of construction at\r\nTrowse, the soil there consisting of sand instead, as was supposed, of\r\nchalk.  The Town Council, on March 16th, agreed that the contract with\r\nMr. Wainwright be cancelled, upon payment to the parties entitled thereto\r\nof 2,800, in full satisfaction of all claims and for the purchase of\r\nplant and materials.  On July 20th the Sewerage and Irrigation Committee\r\nreported that, in consequence of the nature of the soil through which so\r\nlarge a portion of the tunnelling had to be carried, and other unforeseen\r\ncircumstances, the original estimate would be exceeded, but the ultimate\r\ncost of the works would not be more than 81,500, to be reduced to 78,500\r\nby the sale of plant, &c.  A description of the sewerage works was\r\npublished on December 24th, from which it appeared that all the money\r\nauthorised to be raised by Act of Parliament, 75,000, had been borrowed,\r\nand the greater part of it already expended.  The whole of the high level\r\nsewer was completed on this date.  It extended from the Ipswich Road,\r\nalong Town Close Road, through Mount Pleasant Lane, across the fields and\r\nunder Mill Hill Lane to West Pottergate street, Bedford Street, Opie\r\nStreet, the Cattle Market, and King Street, to a point near Messrs.\r\nMorgan's Brewery, where it joined the low level sewer, a distance of more\r\nthan two and a half miles.  Branch sewers had been laid in various\r\ndirections.  The low level sewer, from the New Mills, along Westwick\r\nStreet, Charing Cross, St. Andrew's, Prince's Street, Tombland, Upper\r\nKing Street, and along King Street to the gates had also been completed,\r\na few short distances excepted.  The work was carried out under the\r\ndirection of the engineer, Mr. Morant, and of the Sewerage and Irrigation\r\nCommittee, of which Mr. J. G. Johnson was chairman.  (_See_ October 1st,\r\n1872.)\r\n\r\n9.--Died at Torquay, Sir John P. Boileau, Bart., of Ketteringham Park.\r\nThe eldest son of Mr. John Peter Boileau, he was born in 1794, educated\r\nat Eton and Merton College, Oxford, and in 1813 entered the Rifle\r\nBrigade, from which he retired in 1818.  He married, in 1824, Lady\r\nCatherine Sarah Elliot, daughter of the first Earl of Minto, by whom he\r\nhad two sons, Francis George Manningham, born in 1830, who succeeded to\r\nthe baronetcy, and Edward William Pollin, born in 1831, and five\r\ndaughters.  Sir John was a magistrate and Deputy Lieutenant for the\r\ncounty of Norfolk, and served the office of High Sheriff in 1844.  As a\r\nmemorial to his wife, who died in 1862, he founded the Catherine ward in\r\nthe Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.  He was devoted to the pursuit of\r\nscience and the arts, was a vice-president of the Society of Antiquaries,\r\na Fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society of Artists, president of\r\nthe Norfolk and Norwich Archaeological Society, vice-president of the\r\nNorfolk and Norwich Museum, and a member of the committee of the Norfolk\r\nand Norwich Triennial Musical Festival.\r\n\r\n11.--Prince's Street chapel, Norwich, was re-opened, after having been\r\nre-arranged and improved, under the direction of Mr. Edward Boardman,\r\narchitect, at the cost of 2,600.  As originally planned, in 1819, it was\r\na building of heavy and uninteresting appearance; the new designs by Mr.\r\nBoardman gave to it an imposing facade.  The Rev. Newman Hall preached at\r\nthe opening services.\r\n\r\n12.--A race took place between Joseph Tuck, a pedestrian, of Little\r\nSnoring, and a trotting pony belonging to Mr. Gutteridge.  The match was\r\nfor 40, the distance 500 yards, and the start was from scratch.  Tuck had\r\nthe race in hand the whole way, and passed the winning-post thirty yards\r\nahead of the pony.\r\n\r\n13.*--\"Mr. Bunnett, of Norwich, has successfully undergone the necessary\r\npreliminary of the searching examination in music by Professor Sterndale\r\nBennett.  As a corollary of the examination, the exercise of Mr. Bunnett\r\nfor the degree of Doctor in Music was performed in the chapel of Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge, on the 8th instant, in the presence of Professor\r\nBennett, and produced a very good impression.\"\r\n\r\n16.--The trial of the election petition against the return of the Hon.

We fear that\r\nthe encouragement which has been given by them to persons to withhold\r\ninformation has led to many of those spectacles which have been to us a\r\nsource of signal pain in the course of our inquiry.\"  The Commissioners,\r\nin their report, dated February 15th, 1870, stated that corrupt practices\r\ndid not extensively prevail in Norwich at the election in November, 1868;\r\nthat Sir Henry Stracey was returned through such practices; and that\r\ncorrupt practices did not extensively prevail at the election of 1865 or\r\nthat of 1860.

Frederick Walpole, M.P., \"That the\r\npresent system, which has been successfully in operation during the last\r\nthirty years, carried on by means of voluntary efforts, and maintained by\r\nschool fees, charitable contributions, and grants from the Consolidated\r\nFund, is capable of further extension and improvement, and is able, if\r\nadequately assisted by the State, to supply the national wants of the\r\ncountry without resorting to local taxation for the purpose, unless in\r\nthose extreme cases for which provision can be made in no other way.\"  A\r\nthird resolution was moved by Mr. C. S. Read, M.P., \"That compulsory\r\neducation, except under especial circumstances, such as the case of\r\nvagrant, criminal, and destitute children, would be an unnecessary\r\ninterference with the rights and responsibilities of parents, and unless\r\napplied to all classes of the community, create an unjust and invidious\r\ndistinction between rich and poor, and its enforcement by pains and\r\npenalties would cause a general feeling of hardship and discontent, while\r\nits objects could be attained by other means, such as the extension,\r\nunder due restrictions, of the Factory Acts and of similar measures\r\nregulating the employment of children's labour.\"  The final resolution\r\nwas moved by the Rev. Canon Heaviside, \"That in the opinion of this\r\nmeeting it is expedient that the promoters of Church education should\r\nconsent that in schools aided by the Government grant provision should be\r\nmade for securing perfect liberty of distinctive religious teaching\r\ncombined with perfect liberty of declining it.\"  These resolutions were\r\nadopted.

On October 11th a meeting of the clergy was held, under the\r\npresidency of the Mayor (Mr. A. F. C. Bolingbroke), at the Girls' Model\r\nSchool, Norwich, \"for the purpose of consulting as to the steps to be\r\ntaken under the Elementary Education Act,\" and it was resolved to convene\r\na public meeting for the discussion of the question.  This meeting was\r\nheld on October 19th, at the Free Library, and was composed of \"school\r\nmanagers and supporters of Church education.\"  The Mayor again presided.\r\nThe Lord Bishop moved, \"That, with the view of carrying out the objects\r\nof the Elementary Education Act, 1870, in this city, steps be immediately\r\ntaken to supply and maintain sufficient, efficient, and suitable schools\r\non the voluntary principle, in order to secure in Church schools\r\nreligious education in accordance with the teaching of the Church of\r\nEngland.\"  This was seconded by Mr. Henry Birkbeck.  The Sheriff (Mr.\r\nHenry Morgan) moved, \"That an immediate appeal be made to the citizens of\r\nNorwich to provide funds on the voluntary principle for carrying out the\r\nobject of this meeting.\"  A further resolution was adopted, \"That the\r\nBishop of the Diocese, with the clergy of the city, the managers of\r\nChurch schools, and such donors and subscribers as may be willing to act\r\nbe constituted a council, and shall appoint, as soon as possible, a\r\ncommittee to carry out the former resolutions, and to report progress to\r\nthe council from time to time.\"  The body thus constituted was afterwards\r\nknown as the Church Education Council.  On November 28th the supporters\r\nof voluntary education held a large meeting at St. Andrew's Hall, at\r\nwhich were adopted resolutions framed on similar lines to the foregoing.\r\nThe supporters of unsectarian education held a meeting at the Free\r\nLibrary on the 30th, under the presidency of Mr. Jacob Henry Tillett, at\r\nwhich the Rev. G. S. Barrett moved, \"That a request be sent to the Mayor\r\nto convene a common hall, in order that steps may be taken immediately\r\nfor the formation of a School Board in the city.\"  The Rev. J. Hallett\r\nseconded the motion, which was unanimously adopted, and a committee was\r\nformed for the purpose of carrying it into effect.  The Church Education\r\nCouncil, on December 13th, announced that sufficient subscriptions had\r\nbeen obtained for providing necessary school accommodation in Norwich.\r\nAt a special meeting of the Town Council on December 20th, the return\r\nmade under the provisions of the Act to the Education Department of the\r\nPrivy Council was approved.

It was finally restored and enlarged by Messrs. Hill, of London.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n20.--A movement known as \"The Church's Call\" commenced in Norwich.  A\r\nsimultaneous and united effort was made at all the churches in the city;\r\n\"all seemed resolved to cast aside minor differences, and High Churchmen,\r\nLow Churchmen, and Broad Churchmen apparently vied with each other in\r\ndoing the work set before them.\"\r\n\r\n23.--Died at Warham All Saints, Margaret Green, aged 100 years.  \"The\r\nThursford register testifies to her baptism in that parish on March 27th,\r\n1769.\"\r\n\r\n31.--At the Norwich Assizes, before Mr. Justice Byles, Robert Hardiment,\r\ntanner and fellmonger, was charged on five counts with bribing voters at\r\nthe last General Election to vote for Sir H. J. Stracey.  The\r\nAttorney-General appeared for the prosecution, and the defendant was\r\nfound guilty.  His lordship remarked that this was a very serious crime,\r\nand, as he was desirous that sentence should be pronounced by the highest\r\njudicature of the country, judgment was reserved.  Another person, named\r\nBanfather, charged with bribery at the same election, was acquitted.  On\r\nApril 1st, at the same Court, John Hughes Hulme was found guilty of\r\nbribery, and sentence was reserved.  Edward Stracey, son of Sir Henry J.\r\nStracey, was next charged.  The Attorney-General conducted the case for\r\nthe prosecution, and Mr. A. Staveley Hill, Q.C., was specially retained\r\nfor the defence.  On April 2nd the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.\r\n\"No sooner was the announcement made than deafening cheers were raised in\r\nthe Court, and it was in vain that the officers tried to suppress them.\"\r\nThe defendant Hardiment was indicted, before Mr. Justice Blackburn, on\r\nvarious counts, for committing acts of bribery at the Eighth Ward\r\nMunicipal Election, on November 1st, 1869.  On being found guilty, he was\r\nsentenced to six months' imprisonment.  Joseph Stanley, solicitor, was\r\ncharged with unlawfully conspiring with Robert Hardiment and others to\r\ninduce, by means of bribes, certain persons to vote for Edward Bennett\r\nand George Gedge, candidates at the municipal election in question.  The\r\njury acquitted the defendant.  Anthony Freestone, baker, and Henry Ellis,\r\nshoe manufacturer, were also indicted for conspiring to bribe at the\r\nmunicipal election, and were acquitted.  On April 8th Messrs. W. H.\r\nTillett and Co., solicitors, addressed a letter to the newspapers,\r\nasserting that \"the jury drew lots to decide what their verdict should be\r\nin the cases of Freestone and Ellis.\"  They added, \"The verdict is, of\r\ncourse, bad, and we shall feel it our duty to lay the facts before the\r\ncommittee of gentlemen who instructed us in the prosecutions.\"  No\r\nfurther action was taken, however.  In the Court of Queen's Bench, on May\r\n10th, before the Lord Chief Justice and Justices Blackburn, Mellor, and\r\nHannen, Hardiment and Hulme were brought up for sentence.  Mr. Bulwer,\r\nQ.C., applied for mitigation of sentence in the case of Hardiment, on the\r\nground that he was then undergoing imprisonment for municipal bribery; in\r\nthe case of Hulme it was urged that imprisonment would be injurious to\r\nhis health.  The Court passed sentence of ten months' imprisonment upon\r\nthe first-named defendant, to run concurrently with the six months he had\r\nreceived for municipal bribery, two months of which he had already\r\nserved, to be classed as a second-class misdemeanant, and to be fined\r\n100.  Hulme was fined 100.  Mr. C. S. Read, M.P., subsequently presented\r\nto the Home Secretary a memorial, signed by 1,500 citizens, praying that\r\nHardiment should be classed as a first-class misdemeanant.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--The Rev.

As it\r\nsubsequently proved, the rumour was well founded.  Sir Robert was in his\r\nshrubbery when two pistol shots were heard.  Two workmen employed upon\r\nthe premises, on proceeding to the spot, found Sir Robert in a sitting\r\nposture, bleeding from a severe wound in the chest.  He was at once\r\nremoved into the house and placed in the library.  Mr. Nichols, the\r\nfamily surgeon, and Mr. Cadge were summoned, and on arriving found Sir\r\nRobert in a critical condition.

In consequence of the\r\nlamentable catastrophe which has happened to Sir Robert Harvey, it has\r\nbeen determined by the other partners to suspend the business of the Bank\r\nfor the present.\"  This notice gave rise to increased anxiety.  Messrs.\r\nGurneys offered to afford every possible accommodation to the customers\r\nof the Crown Bank, and a few hours later the National Provincial Bank\r\nmade a similar offer.  The affairs of the Crown Bank being inextricably\r\ninvolved, Mr. Allday Kerrison, one of the partners, signed, on the 16th,\r\na declaration of insolvency, and on the same day the largest city\r\ncreditor, Mr. George Gedge, presented a petition for bankruptcy.  The\r\nsale of the good-will and premises of the Bank was provisionally made to\r\nMessrs. Gurneys and Co. on the 18th.  Mr. Allday Kerrison and his son,\r\ngentlemen of unsullied honour, had their fortunes shattered by one dire\r\nstroke, through the reckless speculations of their partner, speculations\r\nof which they were entirely ignorant.  The inquest was held upon the body\r\nof the deceased baronet at Crown Point on the 20th, by Mr. W. H. N.\r\nTurner, one of the Deputy Coroners for the Liberty of the Dean and\r\nChapter of Norwich, and the jury returned the following verdict: \"The\r\njury are of opinion that Sir Robert Harvey's death was caused by firearms\r\ndischarged by himself while in a state of temporary insanity.\"  A meeting\r\nof the principal creditors was held at the Royal Hotel on the 21st, under\r\nthe presidency of the Mayor, and the following resolution was passed:\r\n\"That this meeting entirely approves of the steps taken by Messrs.\r\nKerrison in suspending the business of the Bank, the measures taken to\r\nprotect the assets of the Bank by the immediate filing of a petition in\r\nbankruptcy and the negotiations for the sale of the goodwill and the\r\nbusiness and premises to Messrs. Gurneys and Co.\"  On the 27th a meeting\r\nwas held at the Royal Hotel for the purpose of considering and discussing\r\nthe best course to be taken in liquidating the estate of the bankrupts.\r\nMr. E. C. Bailey was appointed trustee of the estate, and the Mayor and\r\nMessrs. F. E. Watson, H. S. Patteson, H. Woods, and C. Hornor a committee\r\nof inspection.  The first general meeting of creditors was held on August\r\n3rd, when it was reported that the total liabilities to rank for dividend\r\nwould be 1,600,321, and the total assets 910,187.

In addition to the usual allegations of bribery and undue\r\ninfluence at the last election, there was a special one of\r\ndisqualification on account of corrupt practices at the election in 1868.\r\nOn November 3rd Mr. Tillett obtained an order in the Court of Common\r\nPleas for the striking out of this clause, but leave was given to the\r\npetitioner to move the full Court for a rule to show cause why the order\r\nshould not be rescinded.  On November 23rd motion was made accordingly,\r\nand the Court unanimously ordered the clause which had been struck out to\r\nbe restored.  (_See_ January 5th, 1871.)\r\n\r\n8.--Died at Great Yarmouth, in his 90th year, Mr. Edward Youell, a\r\npartner in the banking-house of Lacons, Youell, and Co.

The Wensum Valley railway scheme, for which an Act of\r\nParliament was obtained in 1864, having been abandoned, it was considered\r\nthat a tramway taking its place would prove useful for conveying produce\r\nfrom the several mills in the district to Norwich.  The estimated cost of\r\nconstruction was 2,000 per mile, and the total estimated cost 14,000.\r\nThe matter was referred to the Paving Committee, and no further steps\r\nwere taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--Mr. Sothern appeared at Norwich Theatre as Lord Dundreary (\"Our\r\nAmerican Cousin\") and Hugh de Brass (\"A Regular Fix\").

For the defendant\r\nit was alleged that he had acted within his jurisdiction.  After two\r\ndays' trial the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, damages one\r\nfarthing.\r\n\r\n8.--An alarming flood occurred at Walsingham.  Owing to heavy rains, the\r\nstream in the vicinity overflowed its banks, and the low-lying part of\r\nthe town was submerged.

He was\r\nborn at Suton, near Wymondham, on June 26th, 1809, and commenced life in\r\na small way of business as a wood carver at Wymondham.  After copying\r\npoppyheads at Wymondham church, he undertook the carving of the seats for\r\nKetteringham and Mulbarton churches.  He then removed to Norwich, where\r\nhe was engaged upon the restoration of the Cathedral stalls and canopies.\r\nWhilst he was working there Mr. James Rattee was placed under him as an\r\napprentice, and the two afterwards became partners.  Mr. Kett was next\r\noffered employment upon the works for the new Houses of Parliament.  In\r\n1845 he removed to London, where he was principally employed under the\r\nimmediate direction of Sir Charles Barry, in supplying designs for the\r\nwood carving.  Among other portions of the work on which he was specially\r\nengaged were the Royal Arms at the back of the Throne in the House of\r\nLords.  Mr. Rattee, in 1848, consulted him upon an estimate for the\r\nrestoration of the choir of Ely Cathedral, and Mr. Kett agreed that if\r\nthe tender were accepted he would remove to Cambridge and assist him in\r\ncarrying it out.  The business partnership thus commenced continued after\r\nMr. Rattee's death, in 1854, with his widow, under the style of Rattee\r\nand Kett.  Mrs. Rattee died in 1866, when Mr. Kett assumed sole control\r\nof the establishment, and was largely engaged in the work of church\r\nrestoration in all parts of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n15.--Died at Felbrigg Park, Mr. John Ketton, in his 61st year.  Mr.\r\nKetton was a native of Norwich, where for many years he was engaged in\r\ncommercial pursuits.

Mr. Land began life as a\r\nNorfolk farmer, and gave great encouragement to steeple-chasing in the\r\ncounty, upon the introduction of that sport in the first half of the\r\ncentury.  One of his earliest winning mounts was in 1836, a horse named\r\nPredictor.  Then he owned a very useful nag called Neewood, and another,\r\nLottery, an exceedingly clever animal over a country.  Land made himself\r\nfurther known by his doings on Jim Crow, Faith, the Novice, Yellow Dwarf,\r\nLittle Nell, Victoria, and Wonder, who could all run and jump a bit, and\r\nsad teasers they were to other Norfolk sportsmen.  While still holding on\r\nhis farm, Land hunted a pack of staghounds, but he gradually got out of\r\nbusiness as an agriculturist, and took to riding and training as a\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n17.--The provisions of the new Licensing Act came into operation in\r\nNorwich.

On week-days\r\nthey were not to open until six in the morning, and to close at eleven\r\no'clock at night.  \"This application of the Act came on the city suddenly\r\nand unexpectedly, the general opinion having prevailed that everything\r\nwould go on as usual until the next annual licensing-day.  In Union Place\r\nand King Street many people determined to have their own way as far as\r\nthey could, and accordingly just before closing time they made a great\r\ndemand upon the can accommodation of the houses.  Large cans and small\r\ncans, when filled with beer, were borne off in triumphant defiance to the\r\npavement outside, or to the men's private gardens or houses, where friend\r\nand neighbour remained drinking, and, in some cases, singing, together\r\nlong after the lights of the various public-houses had been extinguished.\r\nIn two or three instances some ill-advised publicans persisted in keeping\r\ntheir houses open.\"  Several licensed victuallers were fined for\r\ninfringing the regulations of the new Act, and in the early days of its\r\noperation the Norwich magistrates were very liberal in granting\r\nextensions of time on the occasion of the Christmas, Easter, and Whitsun\r\nholidays.  At East Dereham the justices permitted the public-houses to\r\nremain open until twelve o'clock during four months of the year.\r\n\r\n19.--The first really notable journey upon a bicycle was performed by\r\nPercy Everett, of Ryburgh, a lad aged 16.

Everett rode one of the first of the rubber-tyred\r\nbicycles--a machine of Coventry make, known as the \"Aeriel.\"\r\n\r\n20.--Died, Mr. Edmund Harbord Lushington Preston, Mayor of Great\r\nYarmouth.  Mr. Preston was born in 1806, at the period when the Hon.

After the passing of the Municipal Reform Act, he was\r\none of the first burgesses returned to the Town Council on Conservative\r\nprinciples, and, with the exception of a short period, from November,\r\n1868, to November, 1869, he continued to be a member of the Corporation.\r\nMr. Preston was for twenty years one of the magistrates of the borough,\r\nand a member of the Port and Haven Commission.\r\n\r\n27.--The Blake-Bignold incident occurred at the Norwich Police-court.\r\nMr. Blake, on September 2nd, was charged with assaulting a publican, and\r\nfined, and, on his leaving the court, was followed by a mob, who\r\nendeavoured to overturn the cab in which he had taken refuge.\r\n\r\n28.--Lord Walsingham, while shooting on Blubberhouse Moor, Yorkshire,\r\nkilled with his own gun 842 head of grouse, between the hours of 5.30\r\na.m. and 3 p.m.  The birds were driven, and before one o'clock 550 had\r\nbeen bagged.\r\n\r\n29.--A portion of the Reserve Squadron, consisting of nine ironclad war\r\nvessels, under the command of Admiral Randolph, entered Yarmouth Roads,\r\nand sailed on the 30th for the Nore.

Chaplin.  \"It has been our lot to witness some\r\nvery indifferent acting upon the Norwich boards, but we never remember\r\nhaving seen a whole company (with the exception of Mr. Chaplin) so\r\nthoroughly destitute of histrionic talent, or so wretchedly poor in the\r\ndresses whereby to represent the characters.\"\r\n\r\n--The Norfolk and Norwich Triennial Musical Festival commenced with an\r\nevening performance of the \"Festival Te Deum\" (composed in celebration of\r\nthe recovery of the Prince of Wales) and of \"The Creation.\"  The morning\r\nperformance on the 18th was \"Elijah,\" on the 19th \"St. Peter\" (first time\r\nof performance in Norwich); and on the 20th \"The Messiah.\"  On the\r\nevening of the 17th a grand ballad concert took place, and on the 18th\r\nand 19th miscellaneous concerts.

Born in 1803, he was a son of the Rev.\r\nGeorge Wilson, of Kirby Cane (uncle of Lord Berners), by a daughter of\r\nthe Rev. C. Millard, Chancellor of Norwich.  He entered the service of\r\nthe East India Company, and went through some of the earlier campaigns in\r\nIndia.  For his eminent services during the Indian Mutiny he received the\r\nthanks of both Houses of Parliament, and was nominated in succession\r\nCompanion, Knight Commander, and Knight Grand Cross of the Most\r\nHonourable Order of the Bath.  General Wilson was granted a pension of\r\n1,000 a year by the East India Company, and created a baronet.

Bullard and Sons.\r\nEarly in life Mr. Briggs married a sister-in-law of Mr. Richard Bullard,\r\nand sailed for America, where he landed with only a few shillings in his\r\npocket.  He offered his services as an assistant in a lithographic\r\nestablishment, and though practically unacquainted with the business\r\nbeyond a taste for drawing, he not only secured the appointment, but in a\r\nshort time acquired sufficient knowledge of the art to earn a fair\r\ncompetence for himself.  Amongst other work which subsequently came into\r\nhis hands was the drawing of plans for many of the streets and blocks of\r\nbuildings in Chicago, of which the chief part were destroyed in the great\r\nfire.  Mr. Briggs made several remunerative purchases of land in the\r\nUnited States.  Ill-health compelled him to return to England, and,\r\nsettling in Norwich, he joined his brother-in-law in the Anchor Brewery,\r\nthe success of which was greatly promoted by his active business habits.\r\n\r\n19.--At a meeting of the Norwich Town Council, certain members expressed\r\nstrong disapproval of the action of the City Committee \"in ordering the\r\ndestruction of the chapel of Thomas a Becket, one of the archaeological\r\ngems of the city.\"  Several members stated that they had never heard of\r\nthe place, and the Town Clerk informed the Council that the chapel was \"a\r\nvault at the back of the Dutch church,\" and had been converted into a\r\nplace of storage.  The subject was discussed at a meeting of the Norfolk\r\nand Norwich Archaeological Society, on the 20th, when Mr. Gunn referred\r\nto the members of the Town Council as \"a pachydermatous set,\" and Sir\r\nFrancis Boileau described them as \"ruthless Goths.\"\r\n\r\n25.--The Mayor and Sheriff of Norwich entertained, at St. Andrew's Hall,\r\n1,600 of the aged poor of the city, in celebration of the Queen's\r\nbirthday.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--Died, aged 69, Mr. John Oddin Taylor, of Norwich.  He was an Alderman\r\nof the city, \"and the grand Cattle Market and Prince of Wales Road, for\r\nwhich we are mainly indebted to him, are monuments of his far-seeing\r\njudgment and untiring zeal.\"  Descended from a long line of Norfolk\r\nyeomen, Mr. Taylor was born at Thuxton, on April 26th, 1805, and in due\r\ncourse was articled to Mr. T. Bignold and Mr. T. Brightwell.  In politics\r\nhe was one of the old school of Whigs, and on the passing of the\r\nMunicipal Reform Act in 1835 became a member of the Corporation.  Mr.\r\nTaylor was one of the Liberals who protested against the displacement of\r\nthe old Corporation officials.  He served the office of Mayor in 1861-62;\r\nwas made a Deputy-Lieutenant of the county in acknowledgment of his\r\npolitical services as Liberal agent, and was a trustee of the Grammar and\r\nCommercial Schools, and an active member of the Committee of the Norfolk\r\nand Norwich Triennial Musical Festival.

S.\r\nPatteson, when it was reported that the secretary, Mr. Josiah Buttifant,\r\nhad left the city on the 2nd inst., ostensibly for the purpose of taking\r\na holiday; but it was afterwards discovered that he had committed\r\ndefalcations to the amount of about 5,000.  A committee was appointed to\r\nconsider the best course to be adopted, and soon afterwards a petition\r\nwas presented for the winding-up of the society, and a warrant issued for\r\nthe apprehension of Buttifant.  On July 6th William Frederick Fish, a\r\nclerk in the employment of Buttifant, was taken into custody, on the\r\ninformation of Samuel Beckett Hook, a shareholder in the society, on the\r\ncharge of cheating and defrauding Agas Goose and others, trustees, of the\r\nsum of 10 7s., and on other days of divers other sums, amounting in the\r\nwhole to 10,000.  The accused was finally committed for trial on July\r\n20th; and on July 27th Mr. Justice Blackburn granted an application for a\r\nwrit of _certiorari_ to remove the trial of Fish to the Central Criminal\r\nCourt.  On August 14th a telegram was received in Norwich, announcing\r\nthat Buttifant had been arrested at Valentia.  The arrest was effected on\r\nAugust 7th, by Detective Williamson, of the Norwich police.

In 1606 Sir William Paston founded a free Grammar School\r\nin the town for forty boys, sons of inhabitants of the Hundreds of\r\nTunstead, North Erpingham, Happing, and East and West Flegg.  The school\r\ngradually decayed until only the head-master remained.  In 1871 Mr.\r\nRobert Wortley called attention to the fact that the endowment was lying\r\nperfectly useless; an appeal was made to the Endowed School Commission to\r\ntake action, and finally the Committee of Council on Education adapted a\r\nscheme for the management of the school.  New governors were appointed,\r\nwith Lord Suffield as president, the school house and master's house were\r\nrestored, and the Rev. F. R. Pentreath, formerly master of Retford\r\nGrammar School, appointed head-master.

During the last\r\nweek she showed signs of flagging, her limbs swelling, and considerable\r\ndifficulty was experienced in keeping her awake.  It was announced that\r\nshe would walk the last mile with her infant baby in her arms, but it was\r\nevident from her appearance that this would be too much for her, and her\r\ninfant was handed to her when she had only four laps to walk.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--At the Norwich Assizes, before Mr. Justice Keating, Frederick Sutton,\r\nformerly medical-officer of the Norwich Pauper Lunatic Asylum, and Emma\r\nStyggles, head female attendant, were charged with conspiring to cheat\r\nand defraud the Mayor, aldermen, and citizens of the sum of 3 10s. 6.5d.,\r\nin the month of January.

Bulwer, Q.C., M.P., and Mr. William Graham, Crown\r\nCommissioners, opened an inquiry at the Royal Hotel, Norwich, into the\r\ncircumstances of what was known as the Creak case (_q.v._ Vol. I., p.\r\n485; Vol. II., p. 18).  A special jury was empanelled.  Miss Margaret\r\nCreak was an eccentric person, who died in 1850.  It transpired at the\r\ntrial of certain actions brought in 1866 by Mr. Kent, solicitor, that the\r\ndeceased's property in the parishes of St. Andrew and St. George Colegate\r\nhad been purchased by Margaret Creak's mother during her widowhood.\r\nMargaret Creak having died without leaving legal heirs, it was held that\r\nher property devolved upon the Crown, for a strange will made by her had\r\nbeen decided to be void and of no effect.  Since her death the property\r\nhad been held by different individuals, some of whom had exercised the\r\nrights and enjoyed the profits of landlord, whilst others had lived upon\r\nthe property rent free.  The Crown, on being informed of these facts,\r\nissued a Commission under the Great Seal to ascertain (1) what property\r\nMargaret Creak possessed at the time of her death, and (2) what had\r\nbecome of her brothers and sisters.  The jury, on the 8th, found that\r\nMargaret Creak was seised of the fee simple of three lots of property;\r\nthat she left no heir thereto; that the property was of the yearly value\r\nof 330 at the time of her death; and that as the property was holden of\r\nthe Crown in common socage, it devolved to her Majesty, in virtue of her\r\nprerogative Royal.  The jury further said that mesne profits amounting to\r\n7,920 had accrued since the death of Margaret Creak, of which about 2,000\r\nhad been received by Jonathan Flowers, of Gressenhall, and various sums\r\nby other persons.  The Commissioners thereupon seized the property into\r\nthe hands of her Majesty, and ordered the inquisition to be returned to\r\nthe Court of Chancery.  (_See_ July 24th, 1876.)\r\n\r\n11.--The forty-second annual meeting of the British Medical Association\r\ncommenced at Norwich, under the presidency of Sir William Fergusson,\r\nBart., Serjeant Surgeon to the Queen.  The President-elect was Dr. Edward\r\nCopeman.  During the proceedings, which concluded on the 14th, addresses\r\nwere delivered by Sir James Paget, Dr. Eade, Mr. Cadge, &c.  A prominent\r\nfeature of the visit was an exhibition at St. Andrew's Hall of the works\r\nof deceased and living Norfolk and Suffolk artists.  This remarkable\r\ncollection included examples by Old Crome and his sons, Stannard, Stark,\r\nthe Cotmans, Thirtle, Opie, Vincent, Colkett, and others.  (_See_\r\nDecember 9th.)\r\n\r\n12.--The 7th Hussars arrived at Norwich.  The Duke of Connaught was an\r\nofficer of the regiment, and his Royal Highness was welcomed by the\r\ncitizens with great enthusiasm.  At the south entrance to the Guildhall,\r\nLieut.-Colonel Hale and the officers were received by the Mayor (Mr. S.\r\nGurney Buxton), the Sheriff (Mr. A. R. Chamberlin), the Deputy-Mayor (Sir\r\nSamuel Bignold), the magistrates, and members of the Town Council.  An\r\nadjournment was then made to the Council Chamber, where the loving cup\r\nwas passed round, and the proceedings were concluded by the Duke of\r\nConnaught proposing the health of the Mayor.\r\n\r\n17.--A great Liberal demonstration was held at Whitlingham, at which\r\naddresses were delivered by Mr. J. J. Colman, M.P., Mr. Henry Birkbeck,\r\nMr. J. H. Tillett, and other prominent local leaders of the party.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n10.--A terrible railway collision occurred at Thorpe.  The mail train\r\nleaving Yarmouth at 8.46 p.m. was joined at Reedham by another train from\r\nLowestoft.  The combined train proceeded to Brundall, where, owing to the\r\nexistence of only a single line, it had to wait until the arrival of the\r\nexpress train from Norwich to Yarmouth, or until permission should be\r\ngiven to the engine-driver to proceed.  The accident was caused by the\r\ndown express being allowed to leave Norwich while the mail train was\r\npermitted to come on from Brundall.  The telegraphic message to Brundall,\r\nwhich had been written by Night-Inspector Alfred Cooper, but not signed,\r\nwas sent through some mistake by the telegraph clerk, John Robson.  A few\r\nminutes later the inspector, not knowing that the message had gone,\r\nallowed the down express to proceed.  Hardly had he done so when the\r\nfatal error was discovered.  A second message was immediately dispatched\r\nto Brundall to stop the mail, if possible, but the answer came back,\r\n\"Mail gone,\" and nothing remained but to make arrangements for dealing\r\nwith the inevitable catastrophe.  Both drivers had reason for putting on\r\nincreased speed, believing, as they did, that each train was waiting for\r\nthe other.  The speed of the up mail, which consisted of thirteen\r\ncarriages, was from thirty to thirty-five miles an hour, while the rate\r\nof the down express of fourteen carriages was from twenty to twenty-five\r\nmiles.  The trains met near Thorpe village, the impact producing a\r\nterrific crash which resembled a peal of thunder.  The drivers and\r\nfiremen of the locomotives were killed, eighteen passengers were killed\r\non the spot, and about fifty were severely wounded, of whom five died in\r\nthe course of a few days, making a total of twenty-five killed.  The dead\r\nand dying were removed to Field's boathouse and to the Tuns Inn, and the\r\ninjured were taken to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.  On the following\r\nmorning the scene of the catastrophe was visited by many hundreds of\r\npersons, among whom was the Duke of Connaught, then stationed in Norwich\r\nwith his regiment, the 7th Hussars.  The City Coroner (Mr. E. S. Bignold)\r\nopened an inquest on the bodies of two persons who had died at Thorpe\r\nstation, and, after formal evidence, adjourned the inquiry to the 25th,\r\nwhen the jury found that the accident was due to the negligence of Robson\r\nand Cooper, against whom they returned a verdict of manslaughter.  The\r\nCounty Coroner (Mr. E. Press), on the 12th, held an inquest on the bodies\r\nlying at Thorpe, and adjourned the inquiry to the Shirehall.  On October\r\n5th the jury returned a verdict of manslaughter against Robson only.  The\r\nBoard of Trade inquiry commenced at the Guildhall, before Capt. Tyler,\r\nR.E., and Mr. Ravenhill, on September 21st, and on the 22nd was adjourned\r\n_sine die_.  It was resumed on October 5th, and again adjourned.  (_See_\r\nFebruary 23rd, 1875.)\r\n\r\n15.--Madame C. Nilsson, assisted by Madame Patey, Mr. E. Lloyd, Signor\r\nFoli, &c., gave a concert at St. Andrew's Hall, Norwich, in aid of the\r\nendowment fund of the Jenny Lind Infirmary.  A second concert was given\r\non the 16th.

Madame\r\nNilsson was presented with an address by the Mayor and Corporation, in\r\nacknowledgment of her valuable services to the institution.\r\n\r\n17.--The memorial stone of the Norwich Presbyterian church was laid by\r\nMr. C. E. Lewis, M.P., and at a public meeting subsequently held at St.\r\nAndrew's Hall an address was delivered by the Rev. Dr. Chalmers, of\r\nLondon.  The estimated cost of the church was 3,600.  It was designed by\r\nMr. Edward Boardman, architect, of Norwich, and built by Mr. Samuel Hall.\r\nEfforts to establish a Presbyterian church in the city were made in 1866,\r\nwhen a \"station\" was opened and meetings for worship were held at the\r\nLecture Hall in St. Andrew's.  A communion was formed, and in 1867 St.\r\nPeter's Hall, Theatre Street, was purchased by the congregation.  The\r\nchurch, which is built upon a site adjoining the hall, was opened for\r\npublic worship on June 23rd, 1875, by the Rev. John Matheson, the\r\nModerator, and the Rev. Dr. Fraser.\r\n\r\n20.--Three war vessels, the Northumberland, the Sultan, and the Monarch,\r\nforming part of the Channel Fleet, entered Yarmouth Roads, under the\r\ncommand of Rear-Admiral Hancock.

S. Read, M.P., out of the funds of the association, in\r\nacknowledgment of the great services rendered by him to the association.\"\r\nIt was also decided to present Mr. C. R. Gilman, secretary to the\r\nassociation, with a testimonial of the value of 50.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.--Died at Langley Park, Sir Thomas W. H. Proctor Beauchamp, Bart., in\r\nhis 60th year.  Educated at Eton, he entered the Royal Horse Guards in\r\n1836, and in 1852 married the Hon. Catherine Esther Waldegrave, daughter\r\nof Admiral Lord Radstock.  On the death of his father, Admiral Sir\r\nWilliam Beauchamp Proctor, third baronet, he succeeded to the baronetcy\r\nin 1861.  A Liberal in politics, Sir Thomas consented, at the request of\r\nthe party, to contest the representation of the Eastern Division of the\r\ncounty in 1865, in conjunction with Colonel Coke, but was unsuccessful.\r\nUpon the commencement of the Volunteer movement, he gave it his active\r\nsupport, and was for some years Lieutenant-Colonel of the 2nd\r\nAdministrative Battalion.  He served the office of High Sheriff in\r\n1869-70, and was a Deputy-Lieutenant and magistrate of the county.  Sir\r\nThomas was a warm supporter of local charities, and shortly before his\r\ndeath gave a donation of 1,000 to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.  He\r\nwas succeeded by his eldest son, Reginald William, who was born in 1853.\r\n\r\n9.--Died at Costessey Hall, the Hon. Francis Stafford Jerningham, aged\r\n59.  He was the youngest brother of Lord Stafford, and formerly an\r\nexaminer in the Audit Office.  For many years he took an active part in\r\nthe management of the Costessey estate.\r\n\r\n11.--Died, Mr. Edward Freestone, solicitor, of Norwich.  The youngest son\r\nof Mr. Anthony Freestone, he was born at South Elmham St. Margaret, and\r\neducated at Mr. Brewer's school at Norwich.  After serving his articles\r\nwith Mr. Crabtree, at Halesworth, he was admitted an attorney and\r\nsolicitor in 1825, and commenced practice in Norwich and Bungay, in\r\npartnership with Mr. J. C. Copeman.  In politics Mr. Freestone was a\r\nLiberal, but systematically declined to take part in municipal affairs.\r\nHe, however, held several important public appointments.  The Freestone\r\nfamily lived and owned property at South Elmham for nearly 200 years.\r\nFor three generations, ranging over the long period of 150 years, they\r\nhunted their own hounds.  Mr. Freestone's only sister married the\r\ncelebrated botanist, Dr. Lindley and was mother to Mr. Lindley, Q.C., the\r\neminent equity barrister.\r\n\r\n16.--An operetta, in two acts, by Mr. J. Arthur Harcourt, entitled, \"The\r\nScience of Love,\" was performed for the first time by a company of\r\namateurs at Noverre's Rooms, Norwich.\r\n\r\n20.--The East Norfolk Railway, from Norwich to North Walsham, was opened\r\nfor traffic.  The line was constructed by Messrs. Lucas Bros., from plans\r\nby Mr. E. Wilson, C.E.\r\n\r\n22.--Mr. W. H. Cooke, Q.C., Judge of the Norfolk County Court, resigned\r\nhis appointment.  He was succeeded by Mr. Edwin Plumer Price, Q.C.,\r\nRecorder of York.\r\n\r\n23.--Died at Chapel Field Road, Norwich, Mr. Henry Ninham, aged 82.  He\r\nwas the son of John Ninham, who, in 1792, at the request of Mr. William\r\nStevenson, F.S.A., drew, with the assistance of the _camera obscura_, the\r\nancient gates of Norwich, then about to be demolished.  He succeeded to\r\nhis father's business as an heraldic painter and copper-plate printer,\r\nand was for many years employed by the principal coachbuilders of the\r\ncity to paint armorial bearings on their patrons' carnages.  A few days\r\nprior to his death, he completed, for the Very Rev. Dr. Goulburn, a large\r\npainting of the arms of the Deans of Norwich.  Mr. Ninham was a frequent\r\ncontributor to the Norwich exhibitions, both in oil and water-colours,\r\nand made many careful and truthful delineations of picturesque old houses\r\nand churches in the city and its neighbourhood.  A good etcher, he\r\npublished (without letterpress) \"Eight Etchings of Antiquities of\r\nNorwich,\" including the Strangers' Hall, Sir Benjamin Wrenche's Court,\r\n&c.; and afterwards \"Views of the Gates of Norwich,\" from drawings made\r\nby Kirkpatrick about the year 1720.  For private circulation only, he\r\netched a series of small but spirited plates, principally views in\r\nNorwich and Norfolk.  The illustrations of Bloom's \"Castle Acre,\" and\r\nGrigor's \"Eastern Arboretum,\" were also etched by him.  The well-known\r\nworks, \"Remnants of Antiquity in Norwich,\" and \"Norwich Corporation\r\nPageantry,\" were illustrated in lithograph by Ninham from his own\r\ndrawings.  He was a large contributor of illustrations to \"Norfolk\r\nArchaeology\" and other local antiquarian works.\r\n\r\n24.--Mr. Paynton Pigott, barrister-at-law, of the Oxford Circuit, and\r\nrevising barrister of the Western Division of Staffordshire, a nephew of\r\nMr. Baron Pigott, was admitted to the office of Deputy Chief Constable of\r\nNorfolk.\r\n\r\n30.--Died at his residence, Tombland, Norwich, Mr. Thomas Hancock, City\r\nTreasurer.  Mr. Hancock, who made himself prominent by his efforts to\r\nrevive the ancient office of City Chamberlain, took an active part in\r\nmany public movements, and is said to have fallen a victim to over-work.\r\nMr. Edwin Syder Steward was, on November 9th, elected to the vacant\r\noffice of City Treasurer.\r\n\r\n31.--Died at Topcroft Rectory, the Rev. Edward Wilson, aged 75.  Mr.\r\nWilson, early in life, wrote \"The Martyr of Carthage\" in \"Burns's\r\nEnglishman's Library.\"  Soon afterwards, his mind, unhappily, became\r\nclouded, and his services were lost to the Church for over twenty years.\r\nWhen at length a surprising recovery restored him to his friends, he\r\nreturned to the study of theology and the arts with a vigour and\r\nperseverance that would have been remarkable in a young man of unbroken\r\nhealth.  In his youth Mr. Wilson was no mean poet, and his unpublished\r\nverses received the warm praise of Wordsworth.  He had, too, the makings\r\nof a great painter, and some of his best efforts in colouring were\r\nexecuted only a few weeks before his death.  Mr. Wilson was brother of\r\nSir Archdale Wilson, Bart., of Delhi, and first cousin to Henry Wilson,\r\nLord Berners, at whose decease the barony, one of the oldest in England,\r\npassed, through an heiress, into another name.  The family was descended\r\nfrom Bourchier, Lord Berners, the translator of Froissart, and through\r\nhim from Bourchier, the Earl of Essex and his wife, a granddaughter of\r\nEdward III.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.--Died at Lynn, Mr. F. Reynolds, formerly of Newton next Castleacre, at\r\nan advanced age, and in very reduced circumstances.  \"The deceased for\r\nmany years was known by the sobriquet of 'The Marquis,' which was given\r\nhim when he kept a pack of harriers at his own expense, and with which he\r\nhad good sport.  Once in pursuit of a stolen horse, for a neighbour, he\r\ndrove one of his hunters, a bay blood horse, 100 miles in ten hours, only\r\nstopping once, namely, at Six Mile Bottom, near Newmarket, where he gave\r\nhis horse some corn from his own bag, and fetched him water in his hat\r\nfrom a brook.  One of his first, and, perhaps, best hunters, that he\r\ntrained to such perfection, was a bay thoroughbred mare by Old Whisker,\r\nbred by Chifney, the celebrated jockey.  She became a distinguished\r\nhunter with the Marham Staghounds.  For Chip he gave but 8, and this\r\nhorse was afterwards sold by Mr. Anderson for 500 guineas.  Grey Tail,\r\ntoo, was sold by Mr. Taylor for 400 guineas, and Sweep, bought for 10,\r\nwas sold by Mr. Percival for 300 guineas; whilst poor old Hawk struggled\r\non with him in his decline, winning him a few pounds at country races by\r\nhis indomitable pluck, and carrying him miles and miles when other people\r\nwere at rest.  Although Mr. Reynolds had his failings, no one could\r\nimpeach his honour.  He possessed such peculiar blandness, free from\r\nhaughty and unkind feeling, that he was always regarded with something\r\nmore than the common courtesy of life.  He received, in his dying\r\nillness, the greatest attention from his old servant Peter, his former\r\nwhip.\"\r\n\r\n7.--The Prince and Princess of Wales arrived at Sandringham, from\r\nCoventry, accompanied by Prince Albert Victor and Prince George, and by\r\nthe Czarewitch of Russia, Prince Wolkonsky, Prince Bariatinsky, &c.

Mr. Jerningham was attached to the embassies at St. Petersburg and\r\nthe Hague in 1826, was appointed an attache at the Hague in 1832, and\r\nSecretary of Legation in 1833, and was _charge d'affaires_ there until\r\n1836, when he was sent as secretary of legation to Turin, where he was\r\n_charge d'affaires_ in 1838.  He subsequently filed similar offices at\r\nMadrid and Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--Died at his residence, St. Giles' Street, Norwich, Sir William\r\nFoster, Bart., aged 76.  For half a century he had taken a prominent\r\nposition in Norwich in all matters connected with its municipal and\r\ncharitable institutions, and, as the head of one of the oldest legal\r\nfirms in the city, was greatly esteemed in his professional career.\r\nUnder the old Corporation he served the office of Sheriff in 1832, and in\r\n1838 was created a baronet.  Sir William was elected Mayor of Norwich in\r\n1844.  In politics he was a warm supporter of Liberal principles, and was\r\nfor many years the recognised leader of the old Whig school in Norwich.\r\nHe was succeeded by Capt. William Foster, formerly in the 11th Hussars.\r\n\r\n6.--Died at Golding Street, Heigham, Norwich, Mrs. Winifred Johnson, aged\r\n101 years.\r\n\r\n9.--Died at 39, Chapel Street, Marylebone Road, London, Mr. Benjamin Bond\r\nCabbell, F.R.S., F.S.A., of Cromer Hall, in his 94th year.

Dr. Magnan\r\nperformed the operation, and the other defendants took part.  Among the\r\nwitnesses called for the prosecution was Dr. Tuffnell, President of the\r\nRoyal College of Surgeons of Ireland, who said the experiment was cruel\r\nbecause unnecessary, and similar evidence was given by Sir William\r\nFergusson, Professor William Pritchard, R.C.V.S., Professor Varnell,\r\nR.C.V.S., Mr. G. Fleming, Examining Member of the Council of Veterinary\r\nSurgeons, and one of the editors of the \"Veterinarian,\" and others.  For\r\nthe defence it was denied that Dr. Magnan performed the experiment simply\r\nfor the amusement of those present, and Dr. Beverley, Dr. Bateman, Dr.\r\nEade, Dr. Copeman, Mr. Cadge, Mr. W. P. Nichols, Mr. G. W. W. Firth, Mr.\r\nJoseph Allen, and others were called to prove that the operation was\r\njustifiable.

He was educated at Eton\r\nand at Christ Church, Oxford, and entered the Royal Horse Guards, in\r\nwhich regiment he served in the Peninsular War, and was present at the\r\nbattle of Waterloo.  In 1823 he married Eleanor, fifth daughter of Sir\r\nEdward Knatchbull, Bart., and in 1824, on succeeding to the Elmham\r\nestate, assumed the name of Milles in lieu of that of Watson.  After his\r\nretirement from military service, he took great interest in agricultural\r\npursuits, and was very successful in his efforts to improve the breeds of\r\ncattle and sheep.  The Elmham herd of red polled cattle and flock of\r\nSouthdowns attained universal reputation.  His lordship was High Steward\r\nof Great Yarmouth, to which office he was elected in 1854.\r\n\r\n26.--The pantomime at Norwich Theatre was \"Dick Whittington and his\r\nWonderful Cat.\"  At the Prince Arthur Royal Circus, on Castle Meadow, the\r\npantomime, \"King Bombast, or Harlequin Reckless Ralph and his Lilliputian\r\nArmy,\" was produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1875.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--The frost, which, during the preceding week, had been very severe,\r\nsuddenly broke up, and, under the influence of a south-west wind, a rapid\r\nthaw set in.\r\n\r\n--Died at his residence, Surrey Street, Norwich, Sir Samuel Bignold.  He\r\nwas the third son of Mr. Thomas Bignold, of Westerham, Kent, who came to\r\nNorwich towards the close of the eighteenth century, and established the\r\nNorfolk and Norwich General Assurance, \"for the insurance of houses,\r\nstock, and merchandise from fire.\"  The office was in the Market Place,\r\nwhere Mr. Bignold also carried on the business of a wine and spirit\r\nmerchant until the end of 1807.  Mr. Samuel Bignold was elected\r\nCorporation Sheriff on August 9th, 1830, and in 1831 succeeded Mr. John\r\nPatteson as Alderman of the Great Mancroft Ward.  In 1832 he was\r\ninstrumental in introducing to the city Lord Stormont and Sir James\r\nScarlett, as candidates for its representation in Parliament.  During his\r\nMayoralty in 1833 he wrote a letter to the Governor of the Court of\r\nGuardians, suggesting the establishment of a joint stock company for\r\nspinning yarn, in order to give employment to the poor.  The result was\r\nthe formation of the Norwich Yarn Company, and the first stone of their\r\nfactory was laid by Mr. Bignold on December 1st, 1836.  This undertaking\r\nwas commenced with every indication of success, but it finally succumbed\r\nto the powerful competition of the North.  In 1848 Mr. Bignold was a\r\nsecond time elected Mayor, and was chosen a third time for the office in\r\n1853.  On May 3rd, 1854, having been requested by the Corporation to\r\npresent to the Queen an address pledging its loyal support to her Majesty\r\nin the prosecution of the Crimean War, he received the honour of\r\nknighthood, and his portrait was painted by public subscription, by J. P.\r\nKnight, R.A., and placed in St. Andrew's Hall.  In the same year Sir\r\nSamuel was returned as member of Parliament for the city, in opposition\r\nto Mr. Anthony Hamond, the Liberal candidate.  On seeking re-election, in\r\n1857, he was defeated by Lord Bury and Mr. Schneider, and again in April,\r\n1859, by the same gentlemen; but that election was declared void.  In\r\nJune, 1859, when Lord Bury sought re-election, having vacated his seat by\r\naccepting the appointment of Comptroller of her Majesty's household, Sir\r\nSamuel was again defeated, and Lord Bury was a second time unseated on\r\npetition.  In all subsequent elections, although not a candidate himself,\r\nSir Samuel Bignold continued to take an active part.  He was associated\r\nwith many public companies and charitable and other institutions.  After\r\nthe passing of the Municipal Reform Act, he was elected a Councillor for\r\nthe Fifth Ward, which he continued to represent until his death.

Miss Bacon was\r\nparticularly happy in her metrical translations of German, French, and\r\nItalian songs, and the books of the Norwich Festivals for many years\r\nattested her ready talent in giving the spirit of those languages when\r\ncombined with music.  She contributed many fugitive verses and serial\r\ntales in prose to the \"People's Journal\" and other periodicals and\r\nmagazines.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--A special meeting of the Norwich Town Council was held for the\r\npurpose of considering and passing resolutions authorising the Council to\r\npetition Parliament against the Norwich Gas Bill, by which the British\r\nGaslight Company sought to acquire additional lands and to raise further\r\ncapital.

Mr. Giffard, Q.C., was\r\nleading counsel for the petitioner, and Mr. Hawkins, Q.C., for the\r\nrespondent.  It was alleged on the part of the petitioner that a large\r\nnumber of voters had received employment of a colourable character.\r\n\"Wherever possible a voter was made a messenger, clerk, or something.\r\nThe majority for Mr. Huddleston at the General Election was between 40\r\nand 50, but by this kind of device the Conservative majority was\r\nconverted into a minority of one under 800.\"  The inquiry proceeded, and\r\non the 15th Mr. Hawkins announced that \"Mr. Tillett had come to the\r\nconclusion it had been sufficiently established that a great number of\r\nthe lower class voters were employed unjustifiably in his behalf, and he\r\nfelt he could not struggle further to retain the seat.\"  After hearing\r\nthe evidence of Mr. Tillett and a few other witnesses, his lordship said:\r\n\"The result is the respondent has become disqualified by reason of this\r\ncorruption by his agents, and I have nothing more to do than to declare\r\nthe election void and award costs to the petitioner.\"  (_See_ August\r\n16th.)\r\n\r\n13.--The centenary of the banking house of Messrs. Gurneys and Co. was\r\ncelebrated by a dinner given at Stoke Holy Cross, the seat of Mr. Henry\r\nBirkbeck.  \"The original founders of the Bank were John and Henry Gurney,\r\nwho, in addition to their ordinary trade, that of merchants, carried on a\r\nbanking business, first in Pitt Street, and afterwards in Magdalen\r\nStreet.  They were the sons of John Gurney, who earned the title of the\r\n'Weavers' Friend,' by reason of his advocacy of their cause.  The Gurneys\r\nhaving, in 1779, devoted themselves exclusively to banking, the business\r\nwas transferred to Bartlett Gurney (son of Henry Gurney), who removed to\r\nthe present premises on Bank Plain, having as a partner his uncle, John\r\nGurney.  Bartlett Gurney died in 1803, and John Gurney was left sole\r\nproprietor, being joined shortly by his cousins, Richard and Joseph\r\nGurney.  John Gurney lived at Earlham Hall, Richard Gurney at Keswick,\r\nand Joseph Gurney at Lakenham.  Changes from time to time occurred, and\r\nHudson Gurney, Richard Hanbury Gurney, James John Gurney, Henry Birkbeck\r\n(the father of the present head of the firm), and Simon Martin became at\r\nsubsequent periods partners in the great banking house.  The panics of\r\nthe years 1792 and 1825, which caused the failure of many banking houses,\r\nonly resulted in establishing the Gurneys on a firmer and more prosperous\r\nbasis, for they not only survived these financial disasters, but assisted\r\nothers to tide over their difficulties.  The year 1866 will be remembered\r\nas one which tested the stability of the house.  The run on the Bank in\r\nthat and the following year was as remarkable for its intensity as it was\r\nlasting.  The run having ended, the business was further extended in 1870\r\nby the addition of that of Harveys and Hudsons, the goodwill of which was\r\npurchased, and, by the liberality of the firm, that which might have\r\nended in a catastrophe for Norfolk was averted.  It is now by far the\r\nlargest private banking house in the provinces.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.--The Reedham Hall estate was sold by auction by Messrs.

The case was adjourned until this\r\ndate, and the decree not having been obeyed, the Chancellor pronounced\r\nthe respondents contumacious, and issued a certificate to her Majesty in\r\nthe High Court of Justice, in order that an attachment might forthwith\r\nissue against them.  This action resulted in the arrest and imprisonment\r\nof Mr. Gilbert.  At a meeting of the Town Council, on December 21st, Mr.\r\nJ. D. Smith called attention to the case, and stated that Mr. Gilbert was\r\nimprisoned for alleged contempt of court in not paying the costs of the\r\nsuit.

At the Coroner's inquest,\r\nheld on December 18th, a verdict of wilful murder was returned, and the\r\njury expressed, in the strongest terms, their disapproval of the\r\ncircumstances under which Edwards had been admitted to the institution,\r\nand their high opinion of the courageous conduct of Mr. Baumgartner.\r\n\r\n22.--Died at Bombay, Bernard Edward Delaval Astley, tenth Baron Hastings,\r\naged 20.

The importance of the decision\r\nof the Master of the Rolls, as affecting the interests of the\r\nstockbrokers, was great.  But for this claim of 600,000 they would have\r\nreceived 20s. in the pound on their debts, whereas the allowance of the\r\nclaim to rank in competition with their debts prevented Sir Robert\r\nHarvey's private estate paying more than 6s. 8d. in the pound.  The\r\nstockbrokers accordingly appealed to the Lords Justices against the\r\ndecision of the Master of the Rolls, and their lordships upheld the claim\r\nof 600,000, and dismissed the stockbrokers' appeal, with costs.  The\r\nstockbrokers now appealed to the House of Lords, who confirmed the\r\njudgments of the Lords Justices and the Master of the Rolls, and\r\ndismissed the appeal, with costs; in other words, admitting the trustee's\r\nclaim for 600,000.

After many\r\nunsuccessful attempts to construct a dam across the drain, Sir John\r\nHawkshaw, C.E., was called in, and he eventually succeeded in that\r\nobject, and under his advice sixteen large iron syphons, with the\r\nnecessary engine and apparatus for exhausting air from them, were\r\nconstructed upon the dam, so as to secure an outlet of the drainage\r\nwithout admitting sea water from the Ouze.  These syphons answered very\r\nwell for years, but were not equal to the task.  The Commissioners went\r\nto Parliament in 1874, and obtained powers to raise money to construct a\r\nnew sluice, from designs by Sir J. Hawkshaw, at an estimated cost of\r\nbetween 50,000 and 60,000, and the work was commenced by the contractor,\r\nMr. Webster, in September, 1874.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--Died at Hindringham, in his 93rd year, Mr. William Freeman, formerly\r\nresident in Norwich.

It was opposed by\r\nthe Great Eastern Railway Company and Mr. Foster, a local resident, and\r\nthrown out after only the promoters' case had been heard.

His engagement\r\nwas originally announced for April 17th, but the usual postponement\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\n--Application having been made by the Norfolk Court of Quarter Sessions\r\nthat nine disturnpiked roads in the county should, by a provisional\r\norder, be declared ordinary, not main, roads, Mr. Courteney Boyle, an\r\ninspector of the Local Government Board, attended at the Shirehall, to\r\nhear the grounds of the application and any objections thereto.  The\r\napplication had been made on the following grounds: (1) That in\r\nconsequence of the increase of railways, there was comparatively but\r\nlittle through traffic along the disturnpiked reads; (2) there being no\r\nhighway districts in the county, the Court was not prepared to encounter\r\nthe difficulty and expense of dealing separately with the surveyors of\r\nthe large number of parishes through which the disturnpiked roads passed;\r\n(3) that should a highway board be established in the county, the unions\r\nthrough which the disturnpiked roads passed would not be unfairly\r\nburdened by their maintenance, while it would be hard upon outlying\r\ndistricts of the county to contribute to the repair of roads which they\r\nnever used; and (4) that the Court having previously expressed itself in\r\nfavour of county boards, hesitated to sanction so novel and large an\r\nexpenditure for the county rate as would be involved in paying half the\r\ncost of repairing the disturnpiked roads until the ratepayers were more\r\ndirectly represented in the county authority.  Mr. C. S. Read, M.P.,\r\nstated his reasons for moving these resolutions at the Court of Quarter\r\nSessions, and after evidence had been taken in regard to each road in\r\nquestion, the Inspector said that he should make his report.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n19.--A glove fight took place at the Corn Hall, Norwich, in the presence\r\nof an immense audience, between Walter Emms and Arthur Shaw.

Emms and Shaw were\r\nordered to enter into their own recognisances of 100, to find two\r\nsureties of 50 each, and to keep the peace for six months.  The other\r\ndefendants were bound over in the sum of 20 each to keep the peace for\r\nsix months.\r\n\r\n20.--The Norwich Omnibus Company, Limited, was formed.  The first\r\nomnibuses were put upon the Dereham Road route on June 23rd.\r\n\r\n--Died at the Crescent, Norwich, Mr. John M. Croker, aged 57.  His ample\r\nleisure enabled him to be of great service to many of the public\r\ninstitutions of the city, and he was for several years honorary secretary\r\nof the Norfolk and Norwich Cricket Club.\r\n\r\n21.--A fire occurred on Messrs. Willis and Southall's shoe premises, the\r\nUpper Market, Norwich.  The damage was estimated at 1,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--A case of considerable importance to the agricultural community, in\r\nwhich the Earl of Leicester, Lord Lieutenant of the county, was\r\ndefendant, was heard by the Walsingham magistrates.  His lordship was\r\nalleged to have infringed the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878,\r\nand the Animals Order of 1878.  The informations, laid by the Veterinary\r\nInspector of the district (Mr. Edward Case), charged his lordship (1)\r\nwith unlawfully causing to be driven on March 3rd a sheep affected with\r\nsheep scab; and (2) with causing 200 suspected animals to be removed.\r\nAfter a hearing which lasted eight hours, the Bench dismissed the case,\r\n\"because the defendant had satisfied them that there was no cause for\r\nsuspecting the animals removed.\"\r\n\r\n5.--A singular accident occurred at Wells railway station.  The driver of\r\nengine of a passenger train from Norwich was unable to control the\r\nbrakes, and the engine dashing into the station, knocked down the buffer\r\nstops, ran through the end platform, and, crashing into the lavatories\r\nand porter's room, demolished the outer wall of the station, and came to\r\na standstill when partly in the public street.  A young man named John\r\nCook was killed.  At the inquest a verdict of accidental death was\r\nreturned, and at the subsequent Board of Trade inquiry the engine-driver\r\nwas exonerated of blame.\r\n\r\n9.--St. Giles' Hall, Norwich, originally opened as a skating rink, and\r\nafterwards used as a variety hall and theatre, was on this date opened\r\nfor the summer season as a circus by Mr. Stoodley.\r\n\r\n11.--The Summer Show of the Norfolk Agricultural Association was opened\r\nat East Dereham, when the entries were larger than on any previous\r\noccasion.

The visit was\r\nof a semi-private character.  His Royal Highness, who was received at\r\nThorpe Station by the Mayor (Mr. Harry Bullard), the Sheriff (Mr. Donald\r\nSteward), the Earl of Leicester, Lord Suffield, and Lord Carrington,\r\nproceeded to the site of the new building, and having performed the\r\nceremony, returned to the station and travelled by special train to\r\nYarmouth.  The cost of the new Hospital was originally estimated at\r\n35,500, but the Board of Governors subsequently decided to purchase\r\nadjoining property, at an additional outlay of 5,000.  The Board\r\nafterwards adopted a building design jointly prepared by Mr. T. H. Wyatt,\r\nof London, and Mr. Edward Boardman, of Norwich, and accepted the tender\r\nof Messrs. Lacey and Co. for the completion of the work.  (_See_ June\r\n30th, 1881.)\r\n\r\n--The Prince of Wales arrived at Yarmouth, and on the 18th inspected the\r\nPrince of Wales' Own Norfolk Artillery.  His Royal Highness left on the\r\nmorning of the 19th.

H. Tillett\r\nmoved, \"That this Council objects to the proposed schemes of the Charity\r\nCommissioners, particularly to those relating to the Boys' Hospital and\r\nthe Girls' Hospital Schools, on the ground that educational and other\r\nfunds given expressly and emphatically for the benefit of the poor are\r\nthereby diverted from their proper objects, and applied to the increase\r\nof the endowments in middle and upper schools, which schools, if in need,\r\nshould be helped otherwise than at the expense of the poor.\"  The motion\r\nwas adopted, and the Parliamentary and Bylaw Committee were requested to\r\nprepare a petition against the scheme.  A Common Hall was held on July\r\n16th, at which resolutions were adopted expressing dissatisfaction with\r\nthe scheme; and at a meeting of the Town Council, on August 26th, the\r\nParliamentary and Bylaws Committee, in a draft report upon the scheme,\r\nurged that to apply grants originally given for the maintenance,\r\neducation, and advancement of the children of the poor, in aid of the\r\nGrammar and Commercial Schools, or either of them, would involve a\r\nmisappropriation of the funds and a violation of the intentions of the\r\nfounders.  (_See_ October 24th, 1882.)\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--At the Norfolk county magistrates' meeting, a report was received\r\nfrom the Committee of Visitors that several serious cases of erysipelas,\r\nsore throat, and diarrhoea had occurred at Thorpe Asylum, \"and it would\r\nappear that the very offensive smell which pervades the Asylum whenever\r\nthe wind blows from the Sewage Farm on the opposite side of the river is\r\nthe cause of the above-named epidemics.\"\r\n\r\n4.--In the House of Commons, Mr. C. S. Read supported, in a long and able\r\nspeech, Mr. Chaplin's motion, for a Royal Commission to enquire into the\r\ndepressed condition of the agricultural interest.\r\n\r\n6.--Died at the Vyne, Basingstoke, Mr. W. L. Wiggett Chute, aged 79,\r\nformerly of Pickenham Hall, near Swaffham.  He was called to the Bar by\r\nthe Middle Temple in 1827, in which year he assumed, by Royal licence,\r\nthe additional name and arms of Chute, on inheriting the estates of that\r\nancient family in Hampshire and Norfolk.  He was elected with Sir William\r\nBagge in the Conservative interest at the General Election of 1837, and\r\nheld the seat until 1847, when he retired.  In 1837 he married Martha,\r\nsecond daughter of Mr. Theophilus Russell Buckworth, of Cockley Cley.\r\n\r\n9.--A \"silver cradle,\" in the form of a massive epergne, was presented by\r\nthe Corporation to the Mayor of Norwich (Mr. Harry Bullard), \"in\r\ncommemoration of the birth of his daughter, Hilda May, on May 13th,\r\n1879.\"\r\n\r\n11.--Died at Kett's Castle Villa, Mousehold, Norwich, Mr. John Berney\r\nLadbrooke.  Born in 1803, he was a son of Robert Ladbrooke, painter and\r\ndrawing master, and nephew of Old Crome, whose pupil he became after he\r\nhad received rudimentary instruction from his father.  \"Crome's influence\r\nis traced in nearly all his pictures, although of late years in tone and\r\ncolour they more closely resemble the best works of Henry Bright.  He\r\nespecially excelled in the representation of woodland scenery.\"  As a\r\ndrawing master Ladbrooke was much valued.\r\n\r\n12.--Died at Norwich, Mr. John Withers Dowson.  A son of Mr. Benjamin\r\nDowson, merchant, of Geldeston, he was born in 1800.  Educated at Norwich\r\nGrammar School, he was articled to a London firm of solicitors, and\r\nafterwards commenced practice in Norwich.  The pursuit of professional\r\nemolument was, however, less an object with him than the furtherance of\r\nthe education and the improvement of those around him, especially the\r\npoor, and probably no one in the city or county had in his time done more\r\npractical work in the cause of education.\r\n\r\n14.--An inter-county bicycle race, between Norfolk and Suffolk cyclists,\r\nwas ridden from Ipswich to Norwich.  The competitors started from Ipswich\r\nat 3.5 p.m., and the race was won by Popplewell, of Ipswich, who arrived\r\nat the Boileau fountain, Norwich, at 6.5 p.m.  Morgan, of Yarmouth, was\r\nsecond.  The distance ridden was forty-three miles.\r\n\r\n15.--An important question affecting the boundary of the city came before\r\nthe Norwich Town Council.  The Town Clerk reported that, in the\r\npreparation of the Ordnance Survey, a question had arisen as to whether\r\ntwo pieces of land, one containing about 38 acres, situate in the parish\r\nof Catton, and the other of about 45 acres, with 150 houses thereon,\r\nsituate in the parish of Sprowston, should not be included within the\r\nParliamentary and municipal boundary of the city and county of the city\r\nof Norwich.  On investigating the matter, it appeared that, by the\r\ncharter of Philip and Mary, granted to the city in 1556, these two\r\ninclosures of land were clearly defined as being within the city\r\nboundary, and by several ancient manuscripts and books, including\r\nBlomefield's \"History of Norfolk,\" reference was also made to these lands\r\nas belonging to the city.  It also appeared by the report of the\r\nCommissioners appointed to report on the boundaries of boroughs and\r\ncorporate towns, by order of the House of Commons, on April 25th, 1837,\r\nthat such lands were within the city jurisdiction, and a plan attached to\r\nsuch report corroborated the fact.  The matter being important, and the\r\nTown Clerk having been requested to state whether the city authorities\r\nwere willing in the new survey to allow such lands to be shown as forming\r\npart of the county of Norfolk, it was referred to the Parliamentary and\r\nBylaws Committee, for further investigation and consideration.  On August\r\n26th, the Committee reported that they had consulted the Town Clerk and\r\nMajor Jones, of the Ordnance Survey, had referred to extracts from\r\ncharters and from Blomefield, and had resolved that sufficient evidence\r\nhad not been produced to set forth where the boundary of the city of\r\nNorwich should be drawn, and that, therefore, they left Major Jones to\r\ndefine it as he might think best, without prejudice to the rights of any\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n19.--The 3rd and 4th Battalions of Norfolk Rifle Volunteers went into\r\ncamp on Yarmouth South Denes.  Colonel Bulwer, who had succeeded Colonel\r\nDuff, was in command of the 3rd Battalion, and Lieut.-Colonel Gurdon\r\ncommanded the 4th Battalion.\r\n\r\n20.--Owing to a heavy and continuous downpour of rain and a strong wind\r\nblowing from the north-west, the waters of the Yare were \"backed up,\"\r\noverflowed the banks of the river, and submerged many thousand acres of\r\nmarshes between Norwich and Yarmouth.  Most of the hay crop in Norfolk\r\nwas ruined by the wet weather.\r\n\r\n23.--A silver epergne was presented to Mr. E. H. H. Combe, Mayor of\r\nYarmouth, as a \"silver cradle,\" to commemorate the birth of a daughter in\r\nhis year of office.\r\n\r\n26.--Particulars were published on this date of the establishment of the\r\nNorwich Steam Laundry and Public Baths, at North Heigham.\r\n\r\n27.--A remarkable landslip occurred at Attleborough.  As Mr. Gathergood,\r\na farmer, whose land lay partly in Attleborough and Rockland, was\r\ncrossing a turnip field, he was stunned by a loud report resembling the\r\nroar of a cannon, immediately followed by a rustling noise within a yard\r\nor two of him.  On recovering his presence of mind, he discovered that a\r\nspace of land twenty-four yards in circumference had sunk out of sight,\r\nand water was rising in its stead.  On the 28th the water subsided, and\r\nrevealed a chasm from thirty-five to forty feet deep, with perfectly\r\nperpendicular sides.  This strange phenomenon was attributed to the\r\naction of the heavy rainfall.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--A terrible thunderstorm and hurricane commenced in the night and\r\nprevailed during the early hours of the morning of the 3rd (Sunday).  It\r\nwas accompanied by a deluge of rain and a heavy hailstorm.  Great damage\r\nwas done to property in city and county.  But the greatest calamity was\r\nthe destruction of Wells church, the tower of which was struck by\r\nlightning at 5.50 a.m. on the 3rd.  The roof of the nave was soon in\r\nflames, and fell in with a crash, and by nine o'clock the whole church\r\nwas reduced to a state of utter ruin.  The fine peal of bells was totally\r\ndestroyed, and the entire damage was estimated at from 10,000 to 15,000.\r\n(_See_ April 18th, 1883.)\r\n\r\n4.--Died at Oxford Street, Unthank's Road, Norwich, Mr. Thomas William\r\nBond, in his 76th year.  Mr. Bond was some time subeditor, and afterwards\r\npublisher, of the \"Norfolk News,\" and before removing to Norwich kept a\r\nschool at Barton Mills, near Stoke Ferry.  He was the compiler of a small\r\nbook for children, known as \"Bond's Catechism,\" which was published by\r\nJarrold, and for many years extensively used in all parts of the country.\r\n\r\n5.--Died at the residence of his son, Belmont House, Newport, Essex,\r\nZachariah Buck, Mus. Doc.  He was born at Norwich on September 19th,\r\n1798, and at an early age attracted the attention of Dr. Beckwith, the\r\nthen organist of the Cathedral, who took him into the choir.  Dr.\r\nBeckwith died in 1809, and was succeeded as organist by his son, Mr. John\r\nBeckwith, with whom young Buck continued, and to whom he was articled.\r\nOn the death of Beckwith, in 1819, Buck, at the early age of twenty-one,\r\nsucceeded in obtaining the appointment of Cathedral organist, his chief\r\ncompetitor being Alfred Pettet, a fellow-pupil, who was appointed to St.\r\nPeter Mancroft.  Buck soon obtained a large and lucrative practice as a\r\nteacher, and established his reputation as a trainer of boys.  For nearly\r\nforty years he continued to perform the active duties of organist and\r\nchoirmaster, but during the last twenty years of his life he relinquished\r\nthe organ to his subsequent assistant and partner, Dr. Bunnett.  Besides\r\ninstructing during his long career some 7,000 amateur pupils, Dr. Buck\r\ntrained a very large number of professional students, most of whom were\r\nselected from his choir.  He composed no great work, but was the author\r\nof a number of pleasing anthems, and of the hymn, \"Come hither, angel\r\ntongues invite,\" which, it was understood, gained for him his Lambeth\r\ndegree of Doctor of Music, conferred upon him by the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury.  He resigned, on June 5th, 1877, his appointment at the\r\nCathedral, after seventy years' connection therewith.  Dr. Buck was twice\r\nmarried--first to Miss Hansell, and secondly to Miss Holloway, and left\r\nthree sons.\r\n\r\n11.--The British, Archaeological Association opened its congress at\r\nYarmouth.

Read, M.P., having declined the invitation of the\r\nGovernment to become a member of the Royal Commission appointed to\r\nenquire into the depressed state of agriculture and its causes, and\r\nbelieving that he could serve farmers better another way, sailed on this\r\ndate from Liverpool for America, in the City of Montreal liner, in\r\ncompany with Mr. Albert Pell, M.P.  The object of the hon. gentlemen was\r\nto collect, in the United States, information conducive to the inquiry,\r\nand this duty they undertook as unpaid assistant commissioners.  They\r\nmade a tour through the Western agricultural regions of Manitoba, Dakota,\r\nNebraska, Kansas, Kentucky, went south-west to Texas, and returned to\r\nPhiladelphia on November 26th.  They thoroughly examined the system of\r\ncultivation, transportation, and ocean shipment of provisions and grain;\r\nthey travelled an average of 120 miles each day, besides making minute\r\ninvestigations; and in this work they were greatly assisted by the St.\r\nPaul and Sioux City Railway, who gave them the use of a special train for\r\na week.  They examined the terminal and shipping facilities of the\r\nPennsylvania railroad, the American steamship line at Philadelphia, and\r\nthe Abbatoir Company's arrangements for the shipping of live and dead\r\nmeat.  After visiting Baltimore, Washington, and New York, Mr. Read and\r\nMr. Pell sailed for home on December 10th.  Mr. Read arrived in Norfolk\r\non December 22nd, and was welcomed at Wymondham station by Mrs. Read and\r\nseveral personal friends.\r\n\r\n26.--The Town Clerk reported, at a meeting of the Norwich Town Council,\r\nthat the Norwich Improvement Act received the Royal assent on July 22nd.\r\nAmong the works which it enabled the city to undertake was to remove\r\nFoundry Bridge and construct a new one forty-five feet wide; to build a\r\nbridge across the Wensum at St. Martin-at-Oak, and to exercise increased\r\npowers in the sanitary administration and local government of the city.\r\n\r\n30.--The death was announced, at Brussels, of Lord Gordon of Drumearn,\r\nwho, when Lord Advocate for Scotland, in 1867, was returned as member of\r\nParliament for the borough of Thetford.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n16.--The Norwich Town Council adopted a resolution authorising the paving\r\nof the Provision Market with wood, at a cost not exceeding 1,100.

Mr. Grigson's\r\nfavourite studies were archaeology and genealogy.  As an authority upon\r\nthe latter, his assistance was sought from all parts of the kingdom, and\r\nhis name will always be remembered in connection with the \"Visitations of\r\nNorfolk,\" of which work he was a joint editor.\r\n\r\n15.--Died at the Chantry, Norwich, in his 77th year, Mr. G.

In 1833 he married Frances, fourth daughter of Sir\r\nThomas Preston, Bart., of Beeston Hall, and two years after made his\r\nentry into public life by acceding to a request to contest the\r\nParliamentary representation of West Norfolk, which had hitherto been in\r\nundisturbed possession of the Whigs.  In this first attempt to break down\r\nthe political monopoly exercised in the division Mr. Bagge was\r\nunsuccessful; three years subsequently, however, he and Mr. Chute were\r\nreturned.  In 1841 he and his colleague were returned unopposed.  In 1847\r\nthe Liberals made another attempt, and succeeded in electing one of their\r\ncandidates, the Hon. E. K. Coke, but were unable to displace Mr. Bagge\r\nfrom his position.  In 1852 Mr. Bagge was joined by Mr. G. W. P.\r\nBentinck, and the contest resulted in an easy victory over Mr. Hamond.\r\nIt was deemed advisable by both sides in 1857 to have a compromise, and\r\nMr. Bagge, \"from private reasons, and a desire not to disturb the peace\r\nof the county,\" retired to make room for Mr. Gurdon, who, with Mr.\r\nBentinck, thereafter represented the division.  At the General Election\r\nin 1865 the Conservatives resolved to take the entire representation, and\r\nMr. Bentinck's state of health not allowing him to undertake the fatigue\r\nof a contest, Mr. Bagge was asked to come forward with the Hon. T. de\r\nGrey.  The result was a large increase of Conservative strength and the\r\nreturn of both candidates.  In 1867 the honour of a baronetcy was\r\nconferred upon Mr. Bagge, in recognition of his valuable political\r\nservices.  Sir William was succeeded by his eldest son, William Henry\r\nErnest, who was born in 1840.\r\n\r\n14.--A public meeting was held at St. Andrew's Hall, Norwich, for the\r\npurpose of making known in the county the aims and objects of the\r\nFarmers' Alliance.

Read, ventured to take a\r\ndifferent view from that of preceding speakers, and he was subjected to\r\npersistent interruption by certain well-known Liberal politicians.\"  Mr.\r\nJ. Howard, president of the Alliance, and Mr. J. W. Barclay, M.P. for\r\nForfarshire, were among the speakers.\r\n\r\n17.--Two monster pike were captured in private waters in the county.\r\nOne, taken by Mr. Joseph English, of Upper St. Giles' Street, Norwich,\r\nweighed 30.5 lbs., and measured from the nose to the fork of the tail\r\nnearly 46 inches; its girth was 24 inches, and the length of its head 13\r\ninches.

Mr. Read's agent demanded a second count, and on the\r\nclerks going through the papers, one of them discovered a voting-paper\r\nfor Buxton and Read, on the back of which the voter, in distinct\r\nviolation of the Ballot Act, had inscribed his name.  The rejection of\r\nthis paper made the numbers as between Mr. Read and Mr. Gurdon 2,905 and\r\n2,906.  Thus the seat was lost by one vote, and the official return was\r\nmade as follows; Buxton, 2,917; Gurdon, 2,906; Read, 2905.\"  A proposed\r\npetition against the return of Mr. Gurdon was abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--Sir E.

He was succeeded\r\nby Dr. G. Penrice, who was followed by the Rev. Mark Waters, B.A., in\r\n1841.  After the decease of that gentleman, in 1864, the business was\r\nconducted by the Rev. Bowyer Vaux, who, five years ago, resigned, and was\r\nsucceeded by Mr. J. F. Waters.

The\r\nproposal met with strenuous opposition from the inhabitants of\r\nPockthorpe, who claimed the Heath as the property of themselves and their\r\nsuccessors, and asserted that while they were entitled to the rents,\r\nrights, and profits, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had no title\r\nwhatever.

By his\r\nsuccession this property, which came into the possession of the Howard\r\nfamily in 1545, again reverted to the Suffolk and Berkshire line, from\r\nwhich it was separated by the death of Henry, twelfth Earl of Suffolk and\r\nBerkshire, in the year 1779.  Mr. Howard married Lady Audrey Townshend,\r\nyoungest daughter of the Marquis Townshend, in 1873, and left two sons\r\nand two daughters.  He was called to the Bar in 1863, and in 1873 was\r\nappointed a Commissioner in Lunacy, a post which he resigned in 1878.\r\n\"He was the first of the great Howard family who made Castle Rising his\r\npermanent residence and home, for though the estate had been possessed by\r\nthe Howards since 1545 it was always as a political occupation when\r\nCastle Rising was a Parliamentary borough, or as a temporary residence\r\nfor the shooting.  Consequently, through the long period of 335 years not\r\none of the family is known to have died there, and certainly none, with\r\nthe exception of Mr. Howard, have been buried in the parish church or\r\nchurchyard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST.\r\n\r\n\r\n9.--At the Norwich Police Court, William Davies, of the Army Hospital\r\nCorps, Henry Pritchard, and William Solly, privates in the 6th\r\nInniskilling Dragoons, and Staff-Sergt. Alexander W. Browne, Army\r\nHospital Corps, were charged with attempting to kill and murder John\r\nSmith, a private of the 17th Regiment of Foot, at the Cavalry Barracks,\r\non August 3rd.  Smith had been left in the military hospital by a\r\ndetachment of the 17th, who had handed the barracks over to the\r\nInniskillings.  Smith was suffering from a loathsome disease, and it was\r\nalleged that the orderlies of the dragoons and Davies, who had charge of\r\nhim, with the cognisance of Browne, stuffed up the fireplace of the ward\r\nwith straw, closed the windows and door, and placed plates of burning\r\nsulphur upon the floor, for the purpose of suffocating him.  The man died\r\na few days subsequently from the effects of the disease from which he was\r\nsuffering.  The prosecution alleged two motives against the\r\nprisoners--first, that some of them were interested in a will made by\r\nSmith in their favour, and, secondly, that they were desirous of getting\r\nrid of an unpleasant patient.  After several remands, the prisoners were\r\ncommitted for trial at the Assizes.  The case was heard before the Lord\r\nChief Justice on November 12th, when the jury acquitted the prisoners.\r\nSergt.

The trust would have ceased in\r\n1876, but Mr. E. B. Loynes, clerk to the trustees, was instructed to\r\nattend a Select Committee of the House of Commons, to give information on\r\nthe subject.  This resulted in a further period of five years being\r\ngranted, and certain restrictions and conditions were imposed to be\r\nobserved by the trustees.  It was only in 1824 an Act was obtained for\r\nmaking this road.  \"Under no conditions, however, can the trust be\r\nmaintained beyond November 1st, 1881, and therefore after that date the\r\nWells and Fakenham Turnpike Trust will be a thing of the past.\"\r\n\r\n11.--Died at Unthank's Road, Norwich, the Rev.

The thermometer registered 32 degrees of\r\nfrost, and the wind, which during the preceding night had veered to the\r\neast, suddenly assumed the strength of a hurricane, which raged for\r\nnearly twenty-four hours.  \"A velocity of 548 miles was recorded, a force\r\nvery rarely experienced in this part of the country.\"  Little snow fell\r\nuntil about five o'clock in the afternoon, when the clouds discharged\r\nthemselves with a virulence almost unprecedented.  From six to eight\r\ninches of snow fell in a few hours, and in places there were drifts ten\r\nfeet in depth.  The traffic on most of the branch lines of the Great\r\nEastern Railway was suspended nearly twenty-four hours.  The mail train\r\nfrom Norwich to Yarmouth--four hours late--ran into a drift near\r\nBuckenham, and remained embedded six hours.

It was also suggested\r\nthat the Privy Council should prohibit the importation of live animals\r\nfrom countries where they knew disease existed.  A further deputation,\r\nheaded by the Mayor of Norwich (Mr. S. Grimmer), interviewed Earl Spencer\r\non March 25th, with the view of obtaining such relaxation of the Orders\r\nin Council as to permit the sale of store stock at Tombland Fair.  A\r\nfresh outbreak of the disease occurred in the autumn, and on October 28th\r\nthe county authority passed a resolution affirming that, notwithstanding\r\nits recurrence, the time had not arrived for the closing of the markets;\r\nthat should the Privy Council consider it necessary to stop the spread of\r\nthe disease by closing the store stock markets, such order should not\r\ntake effect before the first week in December; that the existing\r\nregulations for preventing the importation of diseased cattle from\r\nforeign countries were entirely insufficient, and that until more\r\nstringent regulations were in force the system of closing markets was\r\nvexatious.

Mr. Wilkinson,\r\nthen only a working-man, in the service of a distinguished firm,\r\nexercised the considerable technical knowledge and natural cleverness he\r\npossessed, and constructed a perforating machine similar to those now in\r\nuse.  This success was made known to his employers, who presented him\r\nwith a sum for the invention, but obtained the credit for it, and also\r\nthe large reward offered.  The inventor gained a competency by his\r\nindustry, went to Yarmouth, and lived happily in retirement.

The defendant, it was\r\nalleged, met the complainant in London Street, and, producing a\r\nriding-whip from beneath his coat, struck him several blows across the\r\nface.  The assault was admitted, and defendant pleaded, in mitigation,\r\nthat he horsewhipped the complainant in consequence of certain statements\r\npublished by him in a paper called \"Daylight.\"  The Bench inflicted a\r\nfine of one shilling, and declined to make an order as to costs.  This\r\nwas the first of a remarkable series of cases arising directly or\r\nindirectly from the publication of the print above referred to.

Mr. Horace Brown was for the plaintiff (who did not\r\nappear), and Mr. Montague Williams for the defendants.  The case was\r\npartly heard when Mr. Brown said that, having regard to what had\r\ntranspired, he did not think it right to ask the jury for damages.  A\r\nverdict was therefore entered for the defendants.  On February 24th,\r\nArthur Ventnor, artist, of Bridewell Alley, was charged at the Police\r\nCourt with wilfully breaking the plate-glass windows at the office of\r\n\"Daylight,\" and doing damage to the amount of 20.  The defendant was\r\ncommitted for trial at the Quarter Sessions, held on April 3rd, before\r\nthe Recorder (Mr. W. J. Metcalfe, Q.C.).  It was urged on behalf of the\r\ndefendant that he had broken the windows owing to a caricature of himself\r\nbeing exhibited therein.  The Grand Jury made the following presentment:\r\n\"We consider that considerable provocation was given to Mr. Ventnor by\r\nthe exhibition of the caricature before he broke the windows.\"  The\r\nRecorder, who deplored the publication of such a paper, addressing the\r\ndefendant, said, \"The sentence of the Court is that you be imprisoned for\r\nthree hours, which means that you have been in the dock a great deal too\r\nlong already, and that you now be discharged.  Who is to pay the costs of\r\nthis prosecution?  Not the public, certainly, but the people who provoke\r\nother people to smash their windows.\"  The verdict was received with\r\ngreat applause by a crowded court.  At the Police Court on April 23rd,\r\nMessrs. Burgess and Burgis appeared in answer to an information laid by\r\nLewin Samuel, clothier, of St. Giles' Street, for publishing in\r\n\"Daylight\" a defamatory libel of and concerning him.  This was a criminal\r\nprosecution, on the fiat of the Public Prosecutor.  The defendants\r\nalleged in their paper that the complainant and his brother were \"Jew\r\nmoney-lenders, who sold up the homes of hard-working men and the beds\r\nfrom under women and children, and extorted 150 per cent. and more,\r\ninterests for small loans.\"  The case was sent for trial at the Assizes.\r\nThe defendants appeared before Mr. Justice Day, on August 9th.  After the\r\ncase had been part heard, Mr. Horace Brown, counsel for the prosecution,\r\nasked leave to withdraw.  His lordship granted the request, and remarked\r\nthat Mr. Brown's client \"had attained his object in having the character\r\nof his business thoroughly exposed to the public.\"  The defendants were\r\nthen discharged.\r\n\r\n26.--The trial of the action.  Boswell _v._ Coaks, commenced before Mr.\r\nJustice Fry.  On the fifth day of the trial, March 12th, his lordship\r\ngave judgment.  In his opinion, he said, the plaintiff's case had failed,\r\nand he dismissed the action, with costs.  Later in the day the judge\r\nremarked that there was a certain point in the case which he had not\r\nappreciated, and ordered the action to be restored to the paper as part\r\nheard.  At the further hearing, on March 19th, his lordship said he\r\nadhered to the view which he previously expressed, and pronounced\r\njudgment unreservedly in favour of the defendants, who were entirely\r\nacquitted of the charge against them.  On June 19th an appeal was entered\r\nagainst the decision of Mr. Justice Fry.

In 1835 he married a daughter of\r\nColonel John Dixon, of Gledhow, Yorkshire, and settled at Dunham Cottage,\r\nNorfolk.  On Lord Sondes' retirement from the command of the Norfolk\r\nRegiment of Yeomanry Cavalry, in 1838, he was made Major Commandant of\r\nthe corps, which in 1841 was, by Royal permission, entitled Prince\r\nAlbert's Own Norfolk Yeomanry Cavalry.

The\r\njudge said that his lordship had acted in a very handsome and generous\r\nmanner, and allowed the prosecution to be withdrawn on the prisoner\r\nentering into recognisances to keep the peace towards the Bishop and all\r\nother persons.  At the Norwich Police Court on September 21st Betts was\r\ncharged with knowingly, wilfully, and feloniously sending to Mr. J. J.\r\nColman, M.P., a letter, signed \"Another Invincible,\" threatening to\r\nmurder him \"unless he fairly and proportionately distributed his last\r\nyear's balance among his workmen.\"  He was committed for trial, and at\r\nthe Assizes on October 27th was sentenced by Lord Justice Fry to twelve\r\ncalendar months' imprisonment.

The scheme for the Grammar and Commercial Schools was\r\npractically the same as those promulgated in 1878.  In the matter of\r\nAnguish's charity, it was proposed to divide the endowment into two\r\nparts, one to be called Thomas Anguish's endowment for boys, and the\r\nother Thomas Anguish's endowment for girls.  The existing boys' school\r\nwas to be given up, the master pensioned, and the income devoted, so far\r\nas 200 yearly was concerned, to providing lodging, clothing, and\r\nmaintenance for boys holding exhibitions preferentially awarded under the\r\nscheme.  With the rest of the income the governors were to maintain seven\r\nspecial exhibitions for poor boys who for not less than three years had\r\nbeen scholars in some public elementary school or schools, and as many\r\ngeneral exhibitions for poor boys as the income available would allow to\r\nbe tenable at either of King Edward VI. schools.  As to Thomas Anguish's\r\nendowment for girls, the girls' hospital was to be abolished and the\r\nincome applied in the same way as that for boys, except that 300 yearly\r\nwas to be devoted to providing lodging, clothing, and maintenance for\r\norphan or other necessitous girls.  Norman's charity was to cease to\r\nexist in its then form, the master pensioned, and the endowment to be\r\nappropriated to the maintenance of a girls' middle school, the scheme for\r\nwhich was practically the same as that for the King Edward VI.  Middle\r\nSchool for Boys, and to be known as Norman's School, provision being made\r\nfor the acquisition by purchase of the Girls' Hospital School at Lakenham\r\nby the new governors of the Norman School.  On August 28th the Norwich\r\nTown Council passed resolutions in opposition to the scheme, on the\r\nground that it was contrary to the wishes of the founders and of the\r\npeople of Norwich; and similar resolutions were carried at a meeting of\r\nthe Norwich Charities Protection Society held at the Guildhall on\r\nSeptember 10th, under the presidency of the Sheriff.  (_See_ February\r\n3rd, 1888.)\r\n\r\n20.--Miss Maude Branscombe and her London company appeared at Norwich\r\nTheatre in the comedy, \"Masks and Dominoes,\" and the burlesque, \"Undine,\r\nor ye Nymph, ye Knight, and ye Awful Fright.\"\r\n\r\n--The Norfolk acid Norwich Hospital was opened by the Duke and Duchess of\r\nConnaught upon its completion.  The actual expenditure to this date had\r\nbeen 51,179, of which about 39,118 had been obtained by subscription,\r\n10,192 was withdrawn from invested capital, and 2,569 was advanced to the\r\ntreasurer by Messrs.

He was unrivalled as an authority upon\r\nconveyancing law.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--At Norwich Police Court, Mr. William Sidney, proprietor of the\r\nTheatre Royal, made application for a licence for the performance of\r\nstage plays in that building.  He stated that it was fifty years since he\r\nfirst performed at the Theatre, when, under the management of Mr.\r\nDavenport, it was open all the year round, and was understood to be a\r\npatent theatre.  It was afterwards purchased by a company of which Sir\r\nWilliam Foster and Mr. Robberds were the chairmen.  He (Mr. Sidney)\r\nbecame lessee and afterwards proprietor, and purchased the shares and\r\nfreehold land.  The understanding during all those years was that it was\r\na patent theatre and required no licence from the magistrates.  The Town\r\nClerk had requested him to produce the patent, but neither he nor his\r\nsolicitors (Messrs. Rackham) were able to do so.  Eventually a patent was\r\nfound, but to their great surprise it was granted to one Thomas Ivory for\r\nseven months in the year only, commencing November 1st.  The Town Clerk\r\nexplained to the magistrates that the attention of the Executive\r\nCommittee of the Corporation having been called to the necessity of\r\ncertain structural alterations at the Theatre, Mr. Sidney was requested\r\nto have them carried out, and in consequence of his non-compliance the\r\nLord Chamberlain was communicated with, and then it appeared that no\r\npatent had been granted to a theatre in Norwich since 1768.  The\r\nmagistrates, before granting the licence, required Mr. Sidney to comply\r\nwith the demands of the Corporation, and on the 19th, it being reported\r\nthat the work was completed, his application was acceded to.\r\n\r\n15.--The coming of age of Mr. John Cator, eldest son of Mr. Albemarle\r\nCator, was celebrated at Woodbastwick by a village _fete_.\r\n\r\n18.--The Duke of Portland laid the last stone of a new dock at Lynn.\r\n\r\n30.--The Norwich Diocesan Conference was opened at the Victoria Hall,\r\nNorwich, under the presidency of the Lord Bishop.

On the 29th\r\na similar meeting, presided over by Lord Walsingham, was held at Lynn,\r\nand a third meeting took place at Fakenham on the 31st.  Deputations from\r\nthe Corporations of Norwich and Lynn waited upon the local authority at\r\nNorwich on February 23rd to discuss what steps should be taken to effect\r\nthe re-opening of the cattle markets in the city and borough, and it was\r\ndecided to send a deputation to the Privy Council.  This deputation,\r\nconsisting of representatives of the county authority, and of the\r\nCorporations of Norwich and Lynn, waited upon Lord Carlingford on\r\nFebruary 28th, and asked for the immediate opening of the markets and the\r\nremoval or modification of other restrictions.

He began life in very\r\nhumble circumstances and without the advantages afforded by education.\r\nThe son of a tailor in a small way of business, he first acted as an\r\nassistant to his uncle, who was ostler at a tavern in Lynn.  He was\r\nafterwards ostler or \"boots\" at inns and hotels in neighbouring towns;\r\nsubsequently he tramped the country for a time, visiting London,\r\nBrighton, and other places in quest of a good situation.  Eventually he\r\nreturned to Lynn, took a public-house known as the Wheatsheaf, in Norfolk\r\nStreet, and made it the local centre of the sporting interest in West\r\nNorfolk.  After a time he bought the house, converted it into an hotel\r\nand wine vaults, and rapidly made a fortune.  Mr. Fiddaman was a\r\nmunificent donor to many benevolent institutions, and his private acts of\r\ncharity were numerous.  An enormous concourse of persons attended his\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\n30.--Died, at his residence, Thorpe St. Andrew, Mr. Richard Noverre\r\nBacon, aged 85, probably the oldest journalist in the kingdom.  At an\r\nearly age he was engaged in newspaper work under his father, Richard\r\nMackenzie Bacon, whom in 1845 he succeeded as proprietor and editor of\r\nthe \"Norwich Mercury.\"  A Whig of the old school, Mr. Bacon in his\r\neditorship of the \"Mercury\" was tenacious in the maintenance of his\r\nopinions, and held them with a firmness which did not always please the\r\nmore advanced section of the Liberal party--hence the establishment of\r\nthe \"Norfolk News\" as the representative organ of Liberal Nonconformity\r\nin county and city.  Mr. Bacon served his fellow-citizens in the Town\r\nCouncil, on the Hospital board, and in other capacities, and assisted in\r\nfounding the Jenny Lind Infirmary for Sick Children.  As a journalist he\r\nwas decidedly inferior to his distinguished father, and his only literary\r\nwork was his \"Essay on Norfolk Agriculture,\" written in 1844, which won\r\nfor him the prize offered by the Royal Agricultural Society, besides\r\nbringing him prominently forward among the agriculturists of the county,\r\na connection he was assiduous in maintaining to the close of his career.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n19.--A deputation of Norfolk magistrates and members of the Norwich Town\r\nCouncil waited upon the Home Secretary (Sir William Harcourt) on the\r\nsubject of the proposed provision of a new prison site at Norwich.  Lord\r\nWalsingham explained the objects of the deputation.  The county prison at\r\nNorwich, with the Castle and a portion of the ground on which it stands,\r\nhaving been offered under Section 34 of the Prisons Act, 1877, for\r\nre-purchase by the original prison authority, _i.e._, the county of\r\nNorfolk, at the statutory price fixed by the Act (amounting in this case\r\nto 10,569), a committee was appointed by the Court of Quarter Sessions\r\nfor the county, and another committee by the Town Council of Norwich.\r\nThe county authority would not consent to take money out of the pockets\r\nof the heavily-burdened ratepayers for the repurchase of property which\r\nthey had been compelled by law to part with for nothing; but they asked\r\nthat this ancient and interesting piece of county property should be\r\nrestored to its original owners \"that it might be by them preserved to\r\nthe best advantage in all its imposing dignity and grandeur.\"  The Mayor\r\nof Norwich (Dr. Eade) stated that Mr. John Gurney had gone so far as to\r\noffer, free of cost, another site for a prison.  The Home Secretary\r\nreplied that the Prison Commissioners would not abandon the site, but\r\nwould continue to occupy it, unless an offer were made which they could\r\naccept.  If it was desired that they should go elsewhere, it should be\r\nmade worth their while to do so.  At a meeting of the Norwich Town\r\nCouncil on April 10th it was reported that the Home Secretary was willing\r\nto accept 5,000 for the Castle, and that a still further reduction was\r\nprobable.  On June 17th the Mayor announced to the Corporation that the\r\nGovernment had agreed to sell to the city the Castle and its environments\r\nfor 4,000; and it was resolved to purchase the property for that sum.\r\n(_See_ October 19th, 1886.)\r\n\r\n20.--Mr. C.

The\r\nprincipal form of practical joking was the discharge of small bags of\r\nflour at any prominent person who chanced to run the gauntlet of the\r\ncrowd.  No ill-temper was displayed, and probably no election ever took\r\nplace in Norwich where so little animosity was exhibited.  We think the\r\nkeeping of the poll open until eight o'clock was generally admitted to be\r\na mistake, as unnecessarily prolonging the excitement incidental to an\r\nelection where party feeling runs high.\"  At the close of the poll the\r\nballot boxes were conveyed to the Guildhall, where the counting\r\nimmediately commenced, and the result was declared at 12.45 as\r\nfollows:--Bullard, 7,279; Colman, 6,666; Wright, 6,251.

Eaton Hall was well fitted for one or both, as it was\r\nsimply a bleak house in a frozen waste; it was redolent of putty and\r\npaint; workmen were tapping just beyond the dining-room door in precisely\r\nthe same way as he should expect to hear tapping in the back manufactory\r\nof an undertaker's shop; and the rooms were furnished with the view to\r\neconomy and discomfort with a show of luxury skilfully but not very\r\njudiciously combined.

The sale\r\nwas conducted by Mr. W. B. Lane.  It was carried out in quite an amicable\r\nmanner, and the humour of the thing was enhanced by Mr. Boyce providing\r\nluncheon for those in attendance.

The money was sent in a letter from Guist\r\nHall, where Lord Henry Bentinck was staying, on January 20th.  The letter\r\nwas as follows:--\"Dear Mr. Wacey--I enclose you a little present as some\r\nsmall compensation for the trouble and worry you have had in connection\r\nwith the election and afterward.  I am much obliged to you for all you\r\nhave done, and I hope you will continue to help us in the future in the\r\nsame able and energetic manner in which you have done in the past.  Yours\r\ntruly, Henry Bentinck.  P.S.  You had better not tell anyone that I sent\r\nyou anything.\"  This letter miscarried, and was delivered not to Charles\r\nWacey, but to Thomas Wacey, who belonged to the party represented by Mr.\r\nArch.  Thomas Wacey ultimately forwarded the postal orders contained in\r\nthe letter to Charles Wacey, who cashed them and kept the proceeds.  It\r\nwas contended on the part of the respondent that the payment made in\r\nJanuary, 1887, had no relation whatever to the conduct or management of\r\nthe election in July, 1886.  The money was paid on account of\r\nregistration services, and the injunction of secrecy was made because to\r\nhave paid all the district secretaries would have involved the respondent\r\nin an expenditure of 100.

Mr. Walter\r\nRye, Mr. Stanley's agent, asked that it might be referred to Mr. Blofeld,\r\nRecorder of Ipswich and Chancellor of the Diocese of Norwich, to enquire\r\nand report who were the persons entitled as freemen to participate in the\r\nrents and profits of the estate, and what persons were entitled to be\r\nadmitted as freemen under the inquiry directed by the judgment given in\r\nMarch, 1887.  His lordship made the order asked for, and directed that\r\nthe inquiry be held at the Guildhall, Norwich, or at such other place as\r\nthe referee might from time to time direct.  Mr. Blofeld opened the\r\ninquiry on March 19th, and continued the proceedings on the 20th, when a\r\nlarge number of freemen attended for the purpose of proving their right\r\nto have their names placed upon the roll.  On the same day (the 20th) it\r\nwas reported to the Town Council that the cost of the Town Close Estate\r\nlitigation amounted to 4,500, and a resolution was adopted for leave to\r\nborrow the amount on mortgage of the estate.  In the Chancery Division of\r\nthe High Court of Justice, on July 7th, a point was raised as to the\r\njurisdiction of the court to affirm a declaration of the Attorney-General\r\ncreating the Town Close Estate a charity.  Mr. Justice Kekewich, on July\r\n14th, sustained the objection taken by the respondents to the\r\nAttorney-General's application, and held that before issuing a summons\r\nthe Attorney-General must establish by independent proceedings an\r\ninformation that there was a charity in existence to be regulated.  The\r\nsummons had been so drawn as to assume the existence of a charity, and\r\nthis was just what his lordship thought could not be assumed.  On\r\nDecember 14th, in the Supreme Court, before Lords Justices Cotton,\r\nLindley, and Bowen, the Attorney-General appealed from Mr. Justice\r\nKekewich's decision.  Their lordships, after hearing arguments, held that\r\nMr. Justice Kekewich had determined by his judgment that the Town Close\r\nEstate was a charitable trust.  On December 20th, however, their\r\nlordships reconsidered their decision, directed the order of Mr. Justice\r\nKekewich to be discharged, and ordered the summons to be set down for\r\nfurther argument, and to decide whether there was or was not a charity.\r\n(_See_ January 21st, 1889.)\r\n\r\n31.--Died, at Southwell Lodge, Norwich, Mr. John Willis, aged 54.

But as we differ from several judgments we think\r\nit only respectful to the learned judges who decided those cases to say\r\nthat we have duly considered everything they have said on the subject,\r\nand therefore we have thought right to take time to put our judgment into\r\nwriting (though we entirely agree in it), and we will deliver judgment\r\nearly in the next sitting.\"  On May 18th the Lord Chief Justice, in\r\ndelivering judgment, said the operation of dishorning was detestably\r\nbrutal, and it was also unnecessary except to enable its owner to obtain\r\na pound or two more for the animal on its sale.

He was born November 1st, 1818, at Quay Side, St.\r\nMartin-at-Palace, Norwich, and was son of Mr. Jacob Tillett, a dyer.  His\r\ngrandfather was a schoolmaster, whose attainments in mathematics,\r\nnavigation, and gunnery brought him into some prominence in his day.\r\nYoung Tillett was educated at King Edward VI. Grammar School, and on\r\nleaving school served his articles with Mr. John Rising Staff, then a\r\nleading solicitor in Norwich.  In 1839 he opened an office for himself in\r\nPost Office Street, and obtained a large and lucrative connection.\r\nLiterary rather than legal work best accorded with Mr. Tillett's natural\r\ntastes.  In 1845 he founded the \"Norfolk News,\" and with the conduct of\r\nthat journal he was thenceforward associated throughout his life, as\r\nchairman of the company and as editor, in which position he not only\r\ncontrolled the policy of the paper, but weekly contributed its leading\r\narticles.  For many years Mr. Tillett was a member of the Town Council,\r\nand twice served the office of Mayor, first in 1859-60 and again in\r\n1875-76.  He was twice returned to a seat on the Norwich School Board,\r\nand on the second occasion was elected Chairman.  In 1874 he was\r\nappointed a justice of the peace, but he never qualified.  Although he\r\nwas not attached to any particular sect, he identified himself with\r\nvarious religious movements in the city.  Mr. Tillett was the most potent\r\npolitical personal force that the century produced in Norwich.  He\r\ncontested the city in 1868 unsuccessfully, Sir Henry Stracey and Sir Wm.\r\nRussell being returned.  That election was invalidated on petition.  In\r\nMay, 1870, when a new writ was issued for the vacant seat, Mr. Tillett\r\nwas returned by 4,236 votes against 3,874 polled by Mr. J. W. Huddleston.\r\nA petition followed, and Mr. Tillett was unseated.  At the dissolution in\r\n1874 the Conservatives brought forward Sir Henry Stracey and Mr.\r\nHuddleston, and the Liberal cause was again championed by Mr. Tillett,\r\nwith Mr. Colman as his colleague.  Mr. Colman was returned at the head of\r\nthe poll with 6,138 votes, and Mr. Huddleston was the other successful\r\ncandidate, with 5,823 votes.  Mr. Tillett polled 5,776 and Sir Henry\r\nStracey 5,290 votes.  Early in 1875 Mr. Huddleston was raised to the\r\njudicial bench, and at the bye-election Mr. Tillett entered the lists\r\nagainst Colonel Wilkinson.  The contest took place on March 5th, and\r\nresulted in Mr. Tillett's return by a majority of 799.  Then came the\r\nthird petition, on which Mr. Tillett was again unseated, and a Royal\r\nCommission followed.  The writ was suspended until the dissolution in\r\n1880, when the Conservatives were represented by Mr. H. Harben and the\r\nHon. Massey Mainwaring.  The seats were carried by Mr. Colman and Mr.\r\nTillett on a poll of 6,549 for the former and 6,512 for the latter, the\r\nvotes for the Conservative candidates being 5,242 for Mr. Harben and\r\n5,032 for Mr. Mainwaring.  The successful candidates were allowed to\r\nretain their seats undisturbed; but Mr. Tillett reached the goal of his\r\nambition too late to derive any satisfaction from it, and the five years\r\nhe spent in Parliament were among the most irksome and worrying of any in\r\nhis life.  At the dissolution in 1885 he announced his intention not to\r\nagain offer himself for the representation of the city; but in 1886 he\r\nwas once more induced to stand, and, with Mr. Colman, opposed the return\r\nof Mr. Samuel Hoare and Mr. C. S. Read.  The result of the poll was as\r\nfollows:--Colman, 6,295; Hoare, 6,156; Tillett, 6,119; Read, 5,564.  With\r\nthis campaign Mr. Tillett practically closed his electioneering career.\r\nWhatever the Conservative party may have thought of his political faults\r\nand shortcomings, Mr. Tillett was no Socialist or Revolutionist.  He was\r\nstaunch in his loyalty to the Throne, and would have strongly opposed any\r\nattack upon the free monarchial constitution.  Although he stood at the\r\n1886 election as a Gladstonian, his convictions were in favour of the\r\nmaintenance of the Union.  For the private character of this eminent\r\ncitizen it was impossible to entertain but one sentiment, that of the\r\nhighest esteem and regard, for he was naturally of a kind, considerate,\r\nand affectionate disposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.--Official notice was received at Norwich of the final settlement of\r\nthe scheme proposed by the Attorney-General for the administration of the\r\nNorwich Town Close Estate Charity.  The scheme provided that the charity\r\nand its property and endowments should be vested in an official trustee\r\nof charity lands for the city of Norwich, and the management,\r\npreservation, and letting of the estate and the collecting of the income\r\nby a receiver would be exercised by trustees consisting of the trustees\r\nfor the time being of the municipal charities of the city, known as the\r\nGeneral Charities, as _ex-officio_ trustees of the Town Close Estate, and\r\nby six representative trustees appointed by the freemen for a term of\r\nfive years.\r\n\r\n15.--The Compton Comedy Company commenced, at the Theatre Royal, Norwich,\r\nan engagement, during which were produced several favourite comedies of\r\nthe old English stage.\r\n\r\n18.--Archdeacon Perowne unveiled, at the church of St. Laurence, Norwich,\r\na bronze memorial in commemoration of the work done by Miss Sarah Ann\r\nGlover in the cause of sol-fa music.

He was the eldest son of Mr. William Norton,\r\nof Old Buckenham, and in his early days was articled to Messrs. Mitchell\r\nand Clarke, a well-known firm of solicitors at Wymondham.  Much of his\r\ntime was subsequently spent in roaming over the greater part of Europe,\r\nand in about 1860 he settled in Norwich.  As a scholar and a man of\r\nscience Mr. Norton was possessed of a store of information such as few\r\nhad acquired.  Sanskrit and geology were his favourite studies.  He was\r\nan omnivorous reader and lover of books, and bequeathed his valuable\r\nlibrary and collection of manuscripts to the Norfolk and Norwich Library.\r\n\r\n24.--The course of lectures arranged by the committee of the Norwich Free\r\nLibrary was continued at Blackfriars' Hall, when Mr. M. P. Squirrell\r\nspoke on \"The Orkney and Shetland Islands.\"  Mr. C.

He\r\nwas born at Red Hall, Leeds, and was educated at St. Catherine's College,\r\nCambridge, of which he became Fellow and tutor.

On withdrawing from the University he\r\nbecame rector of Gimingham in 1833, and an active worker on behalf of\r\nmany diocesan organizations.  He paid special regard to the social\r\nimprovement of the labourers, and was known as \"the father of the\r\nallotment system.\"  For many years Mr. Blakelock was Archdeacon of\r\nNorfolk.\r\n\r\n9.--Died, at Rippon Hall, Hevingham, the Rev. Henry Philip Marsham, aged\r\n75.

The plaintiff asked for an injunction to\r\nrestrain the defendant from shooting or fishing on that part of the\r\nHickling Broad which was in the parish of Hickling, and from boating over\r\nit except in a certain channel.  The defendant contended that the Broad\r\nwas open to the public for all purposes, and that he as one of the public\r\nwas entitled to shoot and fish over it.  The judge held that the\r\nplaintiff had established his right to the part of the Broad in question.\r\nAdmittedly there was a public way over the Broad, but this was restricted\r\nto the channel.  The plaintiff asked for an injunction to restrain the\r\ndefendant from going on the Broad at all except in this channel.  He was\r\nsatisfied on the evidence that this right of way was not so restricted,\r\nand that part of plaintiff's claim failed and must be dismissed.

It was\r\nbrought for the purpose of re-opening the question which, after\r\nprotracted litigation, had been settled in the House of Lords.  The\r\npresent action was founded on allegations of fraud on the part of one of\r\nthe successful litigants in the conduct of the litigation.  The judge did\r\nnot call for a reply.  He said he had come to the conclusion that each\r\nallegation of fraud afforded no probable cause for thinking that the\r\nplaintiff could possibly succeed at the trial.  After this matter had\r\nbeen thrashed out at such an enormous expenditure of time and money he\r\nthought there would be a grievous miscarriage of justice if he did not,\r\nso far as he could, put a closure to steps to open up a matter upon\r\nsuggestions so unfounded and baseless as he considered the plaintiff's\r\npleadings to make.  He did not mean to suggest that plaintiff's advisers\r\nhad instituted the action for the purpose of vexation, but in his opinion\r\nnothing could be more vexatious than that an action should be proceeded\r\nwith in which any chance of success was absolutely hopeless.  Notice of\r\nappeal was given by the plaintiff on August 17th.

This was an\r\nappeal from the judgment of the Lords Justices in the matter of the\r\nHarvey life interest.  The case for the appellant set forth that this was\r\nan appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal, made on November 5th,\r\n1892, in an action in the Chancery Division in which the appellant, on\r\nbehalf of himself and of other unsatisfied creditors of the late Sir\r\nRobert Harvey, was plaintiff and the respondent and others defendants.\r\nThe order of the Court of Appeal affirmed an order of Mr. Justice North,\r\ndated July 27th, 1892, made upon the several motions of the respondent,\r\ndismissing the action as against all the defendants, except one, on the\r\nground that it was vexatious and oppressive.  The appellant only appealed\r\nagainst the order of the Court of Appeal so far as it affirmed the\r\ndismissal of the action as against the respondent.  The action commenced\r\non March 11th, 1892, and the object of it was to establish that the\r\njudgment of Mr. Justice Fry in a former action, Boswell _v._ Coaks, 1881,\r\nwhich judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal, but was subsequently\r\nrestored by the House of Lords, was not binding on the appellant or the\r\nother unsatisfied creditors of Sir Robert Harvey, or of the firm of\r\nHarvey's and Hudson's, on the ground that it was obtained by the fraud of\r\nthe respondents, and to secure for the appellant and the creditors\r\ncertain consequential relief.  Mr. Crackanthorpe, Q.C., and Mr. Brabant\r\nwere for the appellant; and the Attorney-General (Sir John Rigby, Q.C.),\r\nMr. H. H. Cozens-Hardy, Q.C., M.P., and Mr. Lawrence for the respondent.\r\nLord Selborne delivered judgment, and said it was not necessary to hear\r\ncounsel for the respondent.  The question was whether anything material\r\nto disturb the judgment of the House had been newly discovered by the\r\nappellant.  That involved a double proposition--that something new had\r\nbeen discovered, and that that something new was material.  There was a\r\ntotal defect both of allegation and of evidence as to that which alone\r\ncould make it material.  He had no hesitation in saying that in his\r\nopinion it had been dealt with most properly by the Court of Appeal, and\r\nthat their lordships ought now to dismiss this action with costs, which\r\nhe accordingly now moved.  Their lordships concurred, and the appeal was\r\ndismissed with costs.  (_See_ November 13th, 1895.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--Died at Sunny Hill, Thorpe, the Hon. and Right Rev.

The Bench decided that Mr. Matthews, in\r\nusing the word \"doctor,\" did not wilfully and falsely pretend to be\r\nregistered as such, and, therefore, dismissed the case; but they\r\nconsidered there had been an infringement of the law in the use of the\r\nword \"surgeon,\" for which the defendant was fined 1, and 12s. costs.  At\r\nthe Norwich County Court on the 24th Mr. Matthews was sued by the Master,\r\nWardens, and Society of the Art and Mystery of Apothecaries of the City\r\nof London to recover the sum of 20 for unlawfully acting as an apothecary\r\nby attending, advising, and supplying medicines to certain persons.

Mr. Middleton was cited to appear and show\r\ncause why a faculty should not be granted to the churchwardens directing\r\nthem to replace the articles.

Mr. Colman came of an old family of Norfolk\r\nyeomen.  One of his ancestors, Jeremiah Colman, who was born in 1777,\r\nestablished a flour mill at Bawburgh, and afterwards carried on business\r\nat Norwich, whence he removed to Stoke Holy Cross, where was formed the\r\nnucleus of the great commercial undertaking now existing at Carrow.  The\r\nsubject of this notice was the son of James Colman, and was born in 1830.\r\nIn 1856 he married Caroline, daughter of Mr. W. H. Cozens-Hardy, of\r\nLetheringsett.  Mr. Colman was interested in agricultural pursuits and\r\nthe breeding of stock, and his famous herd of red-polls, and equally\r\nwell-known flock of Southdowns were for years represented at all the\r\ngreat shows.  Art and literature obtained his attention, and he collected\r\nan unrivalled library of local works at Carrow Abbey.  Mr. Colman\r\nembarked largely in commercial enterprises connected with the Press.\r\nWith Mr. Jacob Henry Tillett he was instrumental in founding the \"Norfolk\r\nNews\" and other newspapers published by that company, and was largely\r\ninterested in the \"Star,\" the \"Morning Leader\" and the \"East Anglian\r\nDaily Times.\"  In 1862 Mr. Colman was appointed Sheriff of Norwich, and\r\nin 1867 was elected Mayor.  He was first nominated for Parliamentary\r\nhonours upon the unseating on petition of Mr. Tillett in 1871.  His\r\nConservative opponent was Sir Charles Legard, whom he defeated by 1,200\r\nvotes.  This was the last election contested by open voting, in Norwich.\r\nAt the General Election of 1874 Mr. Tillett, freed of his disabilities,\r\nwas nominated as colleague of Mr. Colman; the Conservative candidates\r\nwere Mr. Huddleston, Q.C., and Sir Henry Stracey, Bart.  Mr. Colman and\r\nMr. Huddleston were returned.  The next election took place in 1880, when\r\nthe Liberal party once more made a strenuous effort to secure the return\r\nof Mr. Tillett by the aid of Mr. Colman's popularity.  The Conservative\r\nnominees were Mr. Henry Harben and the Hon. W. F. B. Mainwaring.  The\r\nLiberals were returned by an overwhelming majority.  At the election of\r\n1885 occurred the first indication of the disasters which were to befall\r\nLiberalism in Norwich.  Mr. Harry Bullard was nominated to oppose Mr.\r\nColman, with whom as second Liberal candidate was Mr. R. S. Wright.  For\r\nthe first time in his political career Mr. Colman had to be content with\r\nsecond place, for Mr. Bullard was returned at the head of the poll with\r\n7,297 votes, against 6,666 polled by Mr. Colman, and 6,251 by Mr. Wright.\r\nMr. Bullard was unseated on petition, and it was stated at the time that\r\nMr. Colman was opposed to the course taken by his party.  Mr. Samuel\r\nHoare was then elected unopposed in the place of Mr. Bullard.  At the\r\nGeneral Election in 1886 Mr. Colman regained his former position at the\r\nhead of the poll with 6,295 votes as against 6,156 polled by Mr. Hoare,\r\nwho had Mr. C. S. Read as his colleague.  This election was noteworthy as\r\nthe last occasion upon which Mr. Tillett was nominated.  In 1892 Mr.\r\nColman made his last appearance as a Parliamentary candidate, and with\r\nhim was nominated Mr. James Bedford.  Mr. Hoare, Conservative candidate,\r\nwas returned by a majority of 311 above Mr. Colman; and the\r\nrepresentation of the city remained thus until the General Election of\r\n1895, when Mr. Colman retired, and for the first time in sixty years the\r\nConservative party returned two members, Mr. Hoare and Sir Harry Bullard.\r\nMr. Colman, who was one of the greatest benefactors in Norwich, was held\r\nin deserved esteem alike by political friends and opponents, and many\r\nexpressions of public regret were recorded.  He was predeceased (on the\r\n15th) by his mother, Mrs. Mary Colman, who died at Town Close Lodge, in\r\nher 93rd year.

Mr. Clark was a native of Norwich, and on leaving\r\nschool joined his father as a builder.
