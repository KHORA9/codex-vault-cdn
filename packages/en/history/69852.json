In the thirty-two years of John Islip’s rule\r\nas Abbot he raised its glory to a height which it had never before\r\nattained. In the eight years that followed Abbot Boston reduced it to a\r\nlevel which made its dissolution easy. To plead that Boston was merely\r\nCromwell’s tool is to offer but little excuse, for it was a position\r\nIslip would have disdained to occupy. Had Islip lived to witness an end\r\nwhich perhaps was inevitable he might well have been involved in a\r\ntragedy such as that of Abbot Whiting of Glastonbury. As a man on the\r\nfringe of public life some accusation would not have been difficult to\r\nfabricate.\r\n\r\nThe history of these days therefore is best told in a biographical form,\r\nfor Islip’s activities and Boston’s slack rule touched every department\r\nof monastic life. There are few subjects about which greater\r\nmisconceptions still prevail than the dissolution of the monastic\r\nhouses, and while this little book cannot hope to clear these away it\r\nmay at least provide the true story of one such dissolution. The tale of\r\nthe revival of the monastery under Feckenham in the reign of Queen Mary\r\nhas not been told. It is a detached episode of very great interest but\r\nof very little importance save in one respect quite unconcerned with the\r\nafter history of Westminster Abbey, namely that one of Feckenham’s monks\r\nlived to pass on the lighted torch of the Benedictine succession.\r\n\r\n                                                        H.

The Last Days of the Monastery                               112\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE MANAGEMENT OF THE MONASTERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rule of St. Benedict, made about the year 540, contemplated only\r\nsome four officials as in the main responsible for the management of the\r\nmonastery. These were the Abbot, Prior, Cellarer and Porter. St.\r\nBenedict indeed makes mention of a class of officers called Deans, each\r\nof whom would be responsible for a group of ten monks engaged in the\r\nwork of the field which formed an essential part of his scheme of life,\r\nbut in actual practice no record exists, in England at least, of the\r\nsubsequent existence of such officers. In the monastic government also\r\nsome further distinction was made as between the few monks who were\r\npriests and the majority who in the earlier years of monastic history\r\nwere commonly laymen.\r\n\r\nBy the time of Lanfranc, in the course of a quite natural development,\r\nadditional officers had come to be necessary, and besides those of the\r\nRule there is mention in his _Constitutions_ of the Cantor, Sacrist,\r\nGuestmaster, Almoner and Infirmarer. In the _Customary_ of St. Peter’s,\r\nWestminster, compiled by Abbot Ware about the year 1266, the number of\r\nObedientiaries or principal officers had risen to at least fourteen,\r\nwhile to these must be added the many junior officers who worked\r\ndirectly under them either as deputies or assistants.\r\n\r\nThe gift or purchase of outlying estates and churches necessitated the\r\nappointment of officers to superintend their management and to be\r\nresponsible for the due collection from them of rents and _pensions_.\r\nMoreover any particular extensions of the monastic buildings or church\r\ninvolved the appointment of a temporary _Warden of the New Work_ to\r\naccount for the necessary receipts and expenditure. It was customary to\r\nassign particular estates to the support of particular departments or\r\nelse to arrange for the equitable division of profits among them all.\r\nThus each official had definite sources of income for his office and\r\ndefinite objects upon which that income was to be expended. Year by year\r\nhe was required to submit for audit a roll or balance-sheet accounting\r\nfor the monies of his department, and to many of these rolls were\r\nattached bills or subsidiary rolls of which the chief roll might contain\r\nbut a summary. It is from the survival of such rolls that a knowledge\r\nof the internal economy of the monastery can be obtained, the duties of\r\nthe various officials outlined, and the progress and cost of new\r\nbuildings or repairs duly marked. At Westminster the number of such\r\nsurviving rolls is over three thousand, and in addition there are many\r\naccount-books exhibiting in the utmost detail the expenditure in certain\r\nof the departments.\r\n\r\nExceptions to the general scheme must, however, be noted. At Westminster\r\nthe precentor’s office had some small property in land attached to it\r\nand received some few pensions from churches, but the precentor himself\r\nkept no rolls, for his income and expenditure were small, and his duties\r\nwere not such as to call for much outlay of money. The adult portion of\r\nhis Secular Choir, the forerunners of the lay-vicars of the present day,\r\nwere paid by contributions from the Sacrist and others, while the\r\nSubalmoner had the care of the Singing-children.\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon’s duties were those of a legal rather than monastic\r\ncharacter, and in consequence the history of his office is not to be\r\nfound in monastic rolls. Similarly in the case of officers such as the\r\nprior and others, whose work was mainly that of supervision and\r\ndiscipline, little record survives, with the result that these are for\r\nthe most part far more shadowy figures than the administrative\r\nofficials. The latter seem oftentimes to live again by the human\r\ntouches which creep unawares into what at first glance might seem to be\r\ndull and stereotyped records of receipts and expenditure, and to leave\r\nsmall room for the record of personality. When we have read through some\r\npages of Brother Thomas Browne’s ill-written account-book, which in due\r\ncourse he must submit for the Abbot’s inspection, how shall we translate\r\nthe homely hexameter which quite suddenly appears: _Si mea pena valet,\r\nmelior mea litera fiet_? Brother Thomas becomes no such remote figure\r\nafter all!\r\n\r\nSt. Benedict had with keen foresight anticipated the possibility of a\r\ncertain rivalry as between the Prior and Convent on the one side and the\r\nAbbot on the other, and he would seem to have regarded the prior’s\r\noffice as a necessary evil with which he would rather have dispensed.\r\nCould he have foreseen such a development as took place at Westminster\r\nit can hardly be doubted that he would have devised some special\r\nstatutes to meet a situation which could never have been consistent with\r\nhis ideals or with that half-departure from them which he may in his\r\nbroad-mindedness have contemplated. For Westminster’s Abbot was a feudal\r\nlord with the additional dignity of a mitre.\r\n\r\nIn that later history with which we are most concerned he dwelt apart\r\nfrom his flock. He was no longer the parent at the head of the table,\r\nwith his children gathered round him at the common meal. Affairs of\r\nstate or of his own manorial business were among the lesser calls which\r\nmight take him away from the family of which he was nominally the\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nThe mere fact that he so dwelt apart was for more than two centuries a\r\nfruitful source of dissension. Two households had to be maintained from\r\na common income: what was the proper division of it? New estates were\r\nbequeathed: what was their proper allocation? Anniversaries had to be\r\nperformed: how should the proceeds be distributed? Innumerable and\r\ninevitable expenses had to be met: what share ought the Abbot to\r\nundertake?\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the questions which from time to time disturbed the\r\npeace of the family. Here and there a question could be solved by\r\nspecial legislation. It was easy when a vacancy occurred in the Abbacy\r\nfor the Prior and Convent before they proceeded to election to lay down\r\nthat the next Abbot should be solely responsible for the maintenance of\r\nthe walls which protected their buildings from the periodical threat of\r\ninundation from the Thames. It was easy at such a time to adopt the\r\ngeneral principle that of future bequests the Abbot should take four\r\nparts, the Prior two, and each professed member of the Convent one; but\r\nthere came times when the ordinary provision for the Convent table was a\r\nmatter of anxious thought while the Abbot might seem to have no such\r\ncares. It is no wonder that, until some working arrangement was arrived\r\nat, each ensuing vacancy in the Abbacy should be the occasion for the\r\nformulation of conditions to which the new Abbot was bound to subscribe.\r\n\r\nIt is much to the spiritual credit of the Westminster community that in\r\ngeneral such problems were met by the spontaneous generosity of the one\r\nside or the other. In all but one or two clearly defined cases it may be\r\nsaid that these problems ultimately made for goodwill rather than\r\ndisruption, as giving occasion for the exercise of the primary virtue of\r\nthe Christian life. They form indeed no part of the actual story, but\r\nsome account of their nature is a necessary preliminary to an\r\nunderstanding of the economy of the monastery at any period of its\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to make a survey of the life and duties of the various\r\nconventual officials in these latter days.\r\n\r\nIn theory the Abbot still slept in the dormitory and a chamber was kept\r\nthere for his use. In practice the only person who had access to it was\r\nthe Receiver of his household, and Brother John Islip records that when\r\nhe himself held that office he had two hundred pounds in money belonging\r\nto the Abbot which he kept in a chest in this chamber. In theory the\r\nAbbot dined in the refectory. In practice this may have occasionally\r\nhappened, but these occasions were evidently few. The ordinary\r\narrangement was for a fixed allowance of bread, generally six convent\r\nloaves, to be sent to the Abbot when he was actually in residence at\r\nCheyneygates--the house now occupied by the Dean--or at his Manor of Eye\r\nhard by. This allowance was not sent if he were absent at any other of\r\nhis manors. Otherwise he was expected to maintain his household and\r\nentertain his private guests out of his official income. As it would not\r\nalways be easy to distinguish between personal and official visitors it\r\nwas provided that the Abbot might bring four guests to the refectory\r\nwithout charge, but should he bring more than this number he was to be\r\nresponsible for the additional costs.\r\n\r\nThe Abbot’s income was derived from a considerable number of sources,\r\nand in spite of the many existent documents which record them it is not\r\neasy to make any exact estimate of its total, but at the close of the\r\nfifteenth century it would seem to have amounted to not less than six\r\nhundred pounds a year, no mean sum when the relative value of money is\r\nconsidered. From this of course there were many necessary outgoings.\r\nEstates had to be kept up and wages paid to local bailiffs and workmen,\r\nand at the end of the financial year but a small balance remained to be\r\ncarried forward--and this sometimes was on the wrong side of the\r\naccount. In one casually selected year the actual household expenses of\r\nthe Abbot averaged more than forty pounds a month.\r\n\r\nThe income and expenditure of the Prior were of course on a more modest\r\nscale. Oysters, plaice, sturgeon, salmon, whelks--all these and many\r\nother articles of food appeared on his table as on the Abbot’s, but his\r\nposition did not require the same amount of entertaining of guests as\r\nfell to the latter. Moreover these were frequently of a lower degree in\r\nthe social scale. For instance we note his breakfasts to the singing-men\r\nand dinners to those who had just made their profession in the\r\nmonastery. Visits to his estate of Belsize formed his customary means of\r\nrelaxation from the many cares of the monastery.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to say that neither in the case of Abbot or Prior does\r\nthere appear to have been any ostentation in their manner of life or any\r\nextravagance in expenditure. Each played the part that the standard of\r\nthe time expected of him. If the Abbot seems rather the feudal lord than\r\nthe father of his flock at this period of monastic history, he was the\r\nvictim of a development which he had done nothing to create and saw no\r\nadequate reason to alter. The Abbot of Westminster in the sixteenth\r\ncentury was no more deserving of censure for his mode of life than is a\r\nDean of Westminster in the twentieth.\r\n\r\nOf the administrative officials the Sacrist is in many ways the most\r\ninteresting. He was responsible not only for the general survey of the\r\nfabric of the church and the necessary repairs thereto, but also for the\r\nprovision of most of the accessories of worship. The main items of the\r\nincome of his office were derived from properties within easy reach of\r\nthe monastery, so that business was not apt to arise which would take\r\nhim far afield from what must have been rather exacting duties. Taking a\r\ntypical roll of the early sixteenth century, a long list of houses in\r\nthe Sanctuary and King Street, Westminster, brought him rents amounting\r\nto about £137 out of a total income of just over £208. Some little\r\nproperty in London and elsewhere, with pensions from half a dozen\r\nchurches such as Sawbridgeworth and Bloxham, the “farm” of St.\r\nMargaret’s, Westminster, and the offerings in various of the Abbey\r\nchapels, accounted in the main for the balance. Among some curious items\r\nof receipt there is the yearly sum of thirty shillings and five pence\r\npaid to him by the Sheriffs of London for the maintenance of the lamp of\r\nQueen Matilda.\r\n\r\nApart from some few entries for the repair of houses his expenditure\r\nfell under four main heads. First, more than fifty-five pounds was spent\r\nunder the title “purchase of stores.” This included every kind of light,\r\nwhether wax or oil, for both church and monastery, incense, grease for\r\nthe bells and charcoal for the sacristy.\r\n\r\nThe next heading is the familiar “church expenses.” No less than\r\ntwenty-four thousand breads were bought for the Celebrations. A long\r\nlist includes the costs of the setting up of the great Paschal candle;\r\nrepairs to vestments, thuribles, candlesticks, bells and other\r\naccessories; clearing away snow from the church roof and scattering the\r\ncrows and pigeons that strove to nest there; mending the Abbot’s\r\npastoral staff and buying seven imitation pearls at two pence each to\r\nadorn his mitre. In similar lists in other of the Sacrist’s rolls we\r\nfind record of the periodical lending of copes for service in the King’s\r\npalaces at Westminster and London, and in the year 1520 of the purchase\r\nof canvas and a chest in which to pack the copes for despatch across the\r\nsea, doubtless for Wolsey’s use on the occasion of the historic meeting\r\nbetween Henry VIII. and Francis I. on the Field of Cloth of Gold where a\r\nchapel had been erected, “the last and most gorgeous display of the\r\ndeparting spirit of chivalry.”\r\n\r\nThe two other main heads of expenses are repairs of the church and wages\r\nof the various workmen and servants, among whom are the clock-keeper,\r\nthe rent-collector, the washerwoman and butler.\r\n\r\nThe few remaining rolls of the Subsacrist contain in detail matters\r\nwhich are only summarised in the account of his superior. He was\r\nresponsible for the distribution to the various chapels of their proper\r\nallotment of candles prior to the celebration of their special feasts.\r\nIt is from him that we learn the dedications of forgotten altars, with\r\nhere and there hints of old customs and lost usages.\r\n\r\nTake for example the roll for the year ending at Michaelmas 1524. It is\r\nthirty-three feet in length and accounts in the utmost detail for the\r\nconsumption of nearly five thousand pounds of wax, of which only some\r\nfive hundred were for what may be called lighting purposes as distinct\r\nfrom “lights.” From the notes which he supplies it is not hard to\r\npicture the refectory at Christmas time with the _corona_ above St.\r\nEdward’s statue ablaze with candles, the windows all lit up and the\r\nflaming torches that accompany the carrying-in of the boar’s head. Or\r\npass to the infirmary towards the end of that year where Brother Richard\r\nCharyng lay on his deathbed. He was thought to be dying on August 30th,\r\nbut on September 3rd he was still alive. The Subsacrist knows it for he\r\nhas had to supply pound tapers for his “Aneyleng.” He reminds us that\r\nAbbots Berkyng, Bircheston, and Colchester were still remembered in the\r\nmonastery though the first died as early as 1246, for he has supplied\r\ncandles for the celebration of their “obits.” When he writes of the\r\n“brassen chappell w^{t.}in the new chappell” we know what we had long\r\nsuspected--that there was an altar within the _grille_ which surrounds\r\nthe tomb of Henry VII. A few hints more and we could identify the\r\ndedications of the chapels in the apse of that King’s building. When\r\nsomewhere near St. George’s day he issues a two-pound taper for the\r\ndragon, does he refer to some pageantry within the Abbey church or was\r\nit a gift to its appanage St. Margaret’s, where we know a dragon to have\r\nbeen kept?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the solution is to be found in a mandate addressed by Henry III.\r\nto Edward, son of Odo the goldsmith, requiring him to cause a dragon to\r\nbe made in the fashion of a standard, of red silk sparkling all over\r\nwith gold, the tongue of which should be made to resemble burning fire\r\nand appear to be continually moving, and the eyes of sapphires or other\r\nsuitable stones. This standard was to be placed in the Church of St.\r\nPeter, Westminster.\r\n\r\nThe Chamberlain, like the Sacrist, derived most of his income from the\r\nrents of properties within easy reach. Bequests in the past had been\r\nspecifically made for the provision of clothing for the monks, which was\r\nthe Chamberlain’s main duty. Nine London churches and two country ones,\r\nthose of Ashwell and Uppingham, made contributions to an income of about\r\nninety pounds a year. The Chamberlain was responsible neither for the\r\nclothing of the Abbot nor the outfit of the novices. The former was\r\nrequired to provide all things for himself while the Treasurer paid for\r\nthe somewhat elaborate list of articles required for the latter. Islip\r\nas Treasurer wrote down the full catalogue of these:--\r\n\r\n     In primis payede for ij peyre Straylys. [Stragulæ = bed blankets]\r\n\r\n     Item pro uno materes cum j bolster.\r\n\r\n     Item for a payre Blankettis.\r\n\r\n     Item for ij Coverleddis.\r\n\r\n     Item for a pylow w^{t.} ij pylowe Berys [cases].\r\n\r\n     Item for a Nyghte Cappe w^{t.} ij kerchrys.\r\n\r\n     Item for a Coembe [? comb].\r\n\r\n     Item for a peyre Corkys.\r\n\r\n     Item for Cersey for ij peyre hoson w^{t.} the makyng.\r\n\r\n     Item for the makyng of ij peyre Shockys.\r\n\r\n     Item for ij peyre Botis.\r\n\r\n     Item for ij ffemorallis [drawers] w^{t.} the makyng.\r\n\r\n     Item for a Brygerdell.\r\n\r\n     Item for viij erdis of stamyn [linen] for ij stamyns [shirts] price\r\n     the erde iiij d.\r\n\r\n     Item for a petycote.\r\n\r\n     Item for ij erdes and a quarter of Blake for on Cote price the erde\r\n     ij s. viij d.\r\n\r\n     Item for ij erdis di of Blacke Cloth for an other Cote price the\r\n     erde iij s.\r\n\r\n     Item for ij erdis and quarter of Blacke Coton for a Nygth Cote\r\n     price the erde xij d.\r\n\r\n     Item for lynyng to the same iij Cotis to eche of them iiij erdis\r\n     and a quarter price the erde Vd. ob. q^{a.}\r\n\r\n     Item for the makyng of ij hames Whodis.\r\n\r\n     Item for a pec. of Say to make ij Cowlys and a frocke.\r\n\r\n     Item for a Gerdell ij d. A purse viij d. A peyre of knyves viij d.\r\n\r\n     Item for viij lambes skynys for to ffur a hode and ij Cotis Slevys\r\n     at the hande.\r\n\r\n     Item for ffurryng of the same.\r\n\r\nThe total for this bill came to £2 6s. 5d. exclusive of the first six\r\nitems which have no charge entered and so were presumably drawn from\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nThe Chamberlain was accustomed to renew only some seven articles, those\r\nfor actual day and night-wear. Directly responsible to him were the\r\ntailor, skinner and barber, the last of whom beside shaving the brethren\r\nhad probably to bleed them periodically.\r\n\r\nThe Treasurer’s income in the early sixteenth century was no less than\r\nthree hundred and seventy-six pounds a year, of which two hundred and\r\nforty-one pounds were derived from twenty-four manors. Of these the\r\nManor of Battersea was worth about sixty pounds. Hendon was even more\r\nprofitable with eighty-eight, while Aldenham produced fifty-seven. It\r\nwill be well, however, to mention some of the items of his expenditure\r\nbefore noting the sources of the remainder of his income.\r\n\r\nFirst in the demands on his purse was the purchase of grain. Four\r\nhundred quarters of wheat and a rather larger quantity of barley were\r\nbought for the Convent’s consumption either in the form of bread or\r\nbeer. Not all of this was purchased from outside. It will be obvious\r\nthat since many of the offices were endowed with land each might have\r\ngrain at its disposal, and it was clearly advantageous to have one’s\r\nmarket so close at hand. Hence there arose a system of what may be\r\ntermed interdepartmental dealing, the Treasurer purchasing the produce\r\nof other offices in wheat and at the same time perhaps selling his own\r\nsurplus goods to others of his brother-officials.\r\n\r\nThe Treasurer’s main purpose was the sustenance of the brethren.\r\nAccordingly in addition to his own purchases of food in the form of\r\ngrain he made an allowance of ten shillings a day to the _Coquinarius_,\r\nwhose office is not adequately described if his title be translated\r\nsimply as “cook,” while the ordinary rendering of “kitchener” entails\r\nthe same objection. The _Coquinarius_ would seem to have been a steward\r\nof the kitchen, combining the duties of an overseer and caterer. We\r\nshall take some further notice of him later.\r\n\r\nPayments of the bailiffs of his manors, law expenses, and sundry items\r\nof no general interest added to the Treasurer’s expenditure; and at\r\nthis period of history he found it, like his brethren in other\r\nmonasteries, impossible to make both ends meet, and indeed his\r\nexpenditure exceeded his assigned income by some hundreds of pounds.\r\n\r\nThat portion of his income, about one hundred and thirty pounds, of\r\nwhich no source has yet been indicated was drawn from the merging into\r\nthe Treasurer’s office of other offices which in former times had been\r\nheld separately. The love for the Abbey felt by Queen Eleanor, wife of\r\nEdward I., had been marked by large monetary gifts during her lifetime.\r\nHer burial by the shrine of St. Edward prompted her husband to make\r\nproper provision for the maintenance of her anniversary, and five manors\r\nwere almost immediately assigned to the monastery for that purpose,\r\nthose of Birdbrook, Edenbridge, Westerham, Turweston and Knowle. Two\r\nother foundations of a similar character in connection with Richard II.\r\nand Henry V. succeeded in due course, and Wardens were appointed to\r\nadminister the three.\r\n\r\nBy the time with which we are concerned these offices had been\r\npractically merged with the Treasurership. Consequently the Treasurer\r\nmust account for the receipts and expenditure connected with them. The\r\nincome therefrom swelled his total but gave him no surplus for his own\r\npurposes, since he must purchase the wax, pay for the masses said and\r\ndistribute what remained among the brethren in the usual proportion.\r\n\r\nThe office of Cellarer in the later history of the monastery of\r\nWestminster was one of dignity and importance, but its duties were\r\nprobably of a considerably less exacting character than at the\r\nbeginning. The tendency had been to divide the work formerly assigned\r\nand with the growth of buildings to create new offices, such as that of\r\nthe Granator, rather than merely to provide assistants. Thus in the year\r\nending Michaelmas 1527 the income of the office was only some eighty\r\npounds a year, of which fourteen were spent in mending wagons, shoeing\r\nof horses, repairs of the water-mill and all the various expenses\r\ncommonly associated with the life of the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe Cellarer had the oversight of the brewery, bakery and stables; paid\r\nthe wages of the various labourers connected with them; bought shovels,\r\ncoal-baskets and scoops; was responsible for repairs to the aqueduct\r\nwhich brought the Convent water--a frequent source of trouble,--and\r\nindeed performed a variety of small tasks the recital of which would\r\nonly be tedious. In fact he was an altogether different person from what\r\nthe popular imagination of to-day conceives him to have been.\r\n\r\nThe Granator’s account was rendered yearly like that of other officers,\r\nbut it was an account in kind and not in money. He dealt solely with\r\nwheat, malt and oats, and the account was balanced in terms of these.\r\nSo much had come from Wheathampstead; so much had he received at the\r\nhands of the Treasurer; so much had he delivered to the baker, and so\r\non. His office demanded honesty on the part of its holder but made\r\nlittle demand on intelligence or business capacity.\r\n\r\nThe Almoner’s rolls bring into view an entirely different aspect of\r\nmonastic life. For any proper understanding of his office it is\r\nnecessary to remember that the distribution of alms was an inevitable\r\naccompaniment of requiem masses. Did the Abbot or other benefactor of\r\nthe monastery desire to be remembered in prayer after his death, then he\r\nnot only bequeathed property to endow masses but assigned that portion\r\nof its yield which was to be distributed amongst the poor. Among the\r\npoor he would rightly reckon the brethren of his own monastery as well\r\nas those who came to its gates for alms. With some such endowments,\r\nthough not with all, the Almoner was associated as administrator.\r\n\r\nFor example, on the anniversary of the death of Richard Berkyng, who had\r\nbeen Abbot from 1222 to 1246, we find the Almoner of the sixteenth\r\ncentury distributing twenty pence to each of the monks as well as paying\r\none shilling to the celebrants of the mass which was still said weekly\r\nfor the Abbot’s soul.\r\n\r\nMoreover the provision of some small amenities and comforts for the\r\nbrethren was reasonably regarded as a legitimate charge upon the\r\nAlmoner’s resources. Thus he was accustomed to pay for mats for the\r\ncloister, dormitory and refectory. When the novice first arrived at the\r\nmonastery it was the Almoner who saw that his _camera_ or chamber in the\r\ndormitory was first properly cleansed, paid the penny for his tonsure\r\nand bought two pennyworth of straw with which to stuff his mattress. He\r\nmade some public distribution of alms on rogation days to an amount\r\nvarying from three to five pounds.\r\n\r\nBut the foregoing duties are incidental and the Almoner’s first duty was\r\nto preside, with the Subalmoner’s aid, over the almonry itself--which\r\nlay to the south of Tothill Street outside the ancient boundary-wall of\r\nthe precinct. Here was an almshouse and its chapel of St. Anne, but\r\nlittle can be discovered as to either. Prior to the foundation of the\r\ntime of Henry VII., of which something will be said later, we read of\r\npayments to the “six poor men of St. Edward” who in the year 1492 begin\r\nto be called the “six soldiers of St. Edward.” Then there are the\r\nlay-brothers of the almonry, also six in number, who received one mark a\r\nyear for their clothing and for whom sixteen pence a week was paid for\r\nfood. These latter come first into view in the rolls about the year\r\n1390, when each was receiving a loaf daily from the Cellarer. Provision\r\nwas made for them to attend a weekly mass on Saturdays, but their other\r\nduties and manner of life generally in later days do not seem to be\r\nanywhere defined.\r\n\r\nThe Almoner’s income was not large, amounting in an average year to\r\nabout seventy pounds. Some further account of his cares will appear in\r\nthe narrative of Abbot Islip’s earlier years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJust as the Almonry had its chapel of St. Anne so the Infirmary placed\r\nitself under the protection of St. Katharine, but while the Almonry has\r\nlong disappeared the ruins still remain to hint the beauties of the\r\nInfirmary chapel, and the Infirmarer’s own refectory is still intact.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty-three pounds represents the average income attached to the\r\noffice. The two rectories of Wandsworth and Battersea provided more than\r\na third of this, and the Church of St. Andrew at Pershore a little over\r\neight pounds. A few rents of houses and a portion of the Manor of Parham\r\nin Sussex made up the remainder.\r\n\r\nThe Infirmarer kept a careful record of the names of his patients and\r\nthe number of days which each spent under his charge. This was necessary\r\nin order that he might render a faithful account of his stewardship, for\r\nit was considered that the cost of a sick monk was three pence on a meat\r\nday and two pence on a fish day. The allowance for his own expenses was\r\nreckoned at twenty-three pence a week. On St. Katharine’s day he was\r\naccustomed to send twenty shillings for the entertainment of the Abbot\r\nand Convent, and the balance of his income might be charged with\r\nnecessary repairs either to the Infirmary buildings or to the houses of\r\nwhich the Infirmarer was the landlord.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Treasurer of whom some account has been given there\r\nwas an official known as the Domestic or Inner Treasurer, whose rolls\r\nare of interest as shewing in part the manner by which the monks\r\nobtained their slender individual incomes.\r\n\r\nSo far as this department was concerned these arose from the endowments\r\nof various chantries within the church. In some cases only the\r\ncelebrants of the masses received any payment, but in others all the\r\nbrethren participated. In the case of the anniversary of Abbot Kyrton\r\nthe Prior received two shillings and each brother one, while the\r\nreigning Abbot did not benefit. In that of one John Blokley the Abbot\r\ntook eight pence, the Prior, the President of the Refectory, and the\r\nRefectorer four pence each, and the brethren two pence each.\r\n\r\nThe Domestic Treasurer dealt also with the receipts from properties\r\nwhich belonged in common to the Prior and Convent as distinct from the\r\nAbbatial lands and manors. Each officer taxed his own income at the rate\r\nof one penny in the mark towards the general fund, but it does not\r\nappear that the Domestic Treasurer administered the proceeds.\r\n\r\nThe Refectorer’s office was not one of great importance. It might be\r\nsupposed that he was concerned with the provision of meals for the\r\nbrethren, but the only article of food which it was his duty to provide\r\nwas cheese, which cost between three and four pounds a year out of an\r\nincome of little more than ten. He was responsible for the general\r\nupkeep of the refectory, whether for the repair of its walls and windows\r\nor the renewal when necessary of the cloths and other appurtenances of\r\nthe table. He provided the wax for such candles as the Subsacrist was\r\nnot required to supply, and cushions for the seats of the President and\r\nseniors.\r\n\r\nSome slight information can be gleaned from his rolls as to the general\r\narrangements of the refectory. There was the table of the President with\r\nthe _skilla_ or bell beside it, the sounding of which marked the various\r\nincidents of the meal; the two tables of the senior monks, the two\r\ntables appropriated to the undistinguished among the brethren, the table\r\nof the novices, and finally that set for the poor--the _mensa pauperum_.\r\nSomewhere in the refectory stood a statue of St. Edward with a crown of\r\nlights above him, which must be in order for the Feasts of the\r\nTranslation and Deposition of the Convent’s tutelary saint. We note the\r\nhomely designation of the larger cups as the _Long Robin_ and the\r\n_Charity Bowl_.\r\n\r\nThe Monk Bailiff is perhaps the most perplexing of any of the monastic\r\nofficers. It is not possible as in the case of others to obtain any\r\nadequate conception of his duties from the rolls which he kept, for he\r\nrecords merely the payment of fees without specifying the various\r\nservices rendered. It must be supposed that he was responsible for\r\ngeneral matters of law in which the monastery might be involved, for he\r\nnotes year by year a payment of twenty shillings to the monastery’s\r\nattorney in the royal exchequer, of another twenty shillings to an\r\nattorney in the King’s Bench and of double that sum to an attorney in\r\nthe Common Bench, with other smaller payments to legal officials. Fees\r\nto the bailiffs of the liberties in various counties also occur with\r\nregularity. He had his own apartments and staff of servants, his own\r\nstables, grooms and horses.\r\n\r\nSome few of the Kitchener’s notebooks have survived, shewing in the\r\nutmost detail all the items of his expenditure on the food of the\r\nbrethren. Wednesday, Friday and Saturday were ordinarily kept as days of\r\nabstinence from meat. It seems probable from the form of certain entries\r\nthat meat was served in the Refectory only on Sundays. In the\r\nMisericorde where the brethren who had been bled took their meals, as\r\nwell as those monks who for any reason had been ordered a more generous\r\ndiet, meat was served on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, both at dinner\r\nand supper--unless of course some fast-day fell on one of these, while\r\neggs might be served for supper there on Wednesdays.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary dinner in the Refectory consisted of two fish courses with\r\nthe Convent loaf in addition. On Sundays it was not uncommon to provide\r\nnine pieces of beef, two sheep and two fat pigs, with “smalle\r\npoddynges.” Forgotten terms are recalled in _scroffe_ or Shrove Sunday\r\nand Shrove Monday as well as Shrove Tuesday. On the two latter days a\r\nbreakfast was provided, in addition to the ordinary fare, of red\r\nherrings and red sprats. Throughout Lent neither meat nor eggs was\r\nprovided either in the Refectory or Misericorde, but leeks, onions, and\r\npeas for pottage occur frequently, with now and then a pittance of salt\r\neels. The Sunday dinner was varied by the provision of figs and almonds.\r\nOne red herring each was served on Good Friday with some almonds and\r\nrice, but white herrings were bought for guests. On _Schere_ or Maundy\r\nThursday it was the custom for the Abbot to supplement the Convent meal.\r\nEaster Day of course saw a considerable relaxation. Eggs for breakfast\r\nand supper, veal and beef at dinner with currant puddings to follow, not\r\nto mention two gallons of wine, marked the joyous character of the\r\nfestival. The Kitchener’s expenses varied between three and six pounds a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nOne other important officer remains to be noted, the Warden of the Lady\r\nChapel. He had his own property and consequently was obliged to submit\r\nhis accounts for yearly audit, but it is sufficient to say of him that\r\nhe did for the Lady Chapel in all respects what the Sacrist did for the\r\nrest of the church.\r\n\r\nA number of minor officials receive occasional mention. We read of the\r\nWardens of other Chapels in the monastery, of the Keeper of St. Edward’s\r\nShrine, the Keeper of the relics and so on, but curiously enough only\r\nhere and there is there any actual record of a Guestmaster and that only\r\nin the reign of Henry III. It seems probable that every professed monk\r\nin the monastery was provided with some specific task or charge.\r\n\r\nIt would be easier to write a volume than a single chapter on monastic\r\nlife at Westminster. What has been here set down is no more than what\r\nthe surviving rolls and documents of the later times actually tell as to\r\nthe surroundings and life of the last sixty years of the monastery’s\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY YEARS OF BROTHER JOHN ISLIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the closing years of the fifteenth century, almost certainly in the\r\nyear 1492, John Islip began to keep a diary. Like many another such\r\nvolume it is remarkable for the prolixity of its earlier pages, the\r\nscantier entries which succeed them, and the final omission of all but\r\nnecessary business notes which had to be recorded somewhere. It is from\r\nthis diary that the facts of his first years are derived. He was\r\ntwenty-eight years old and it seemed a fitting occasion to put down\r\nsomething of the story of his life, for already he had become of some\r\nimportance in the monastery by his appointment to offices of\r\nconsiderable responsibility and trust. So he records what seemed to him\r\nthe leading events of his earlier days and some few happenings in the\r\nlife of the outside world that had struck him as of interest or\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nHe was born at Islip in Oxfordshire on June 10th in the year 1464. Islip\r\nitself had been the birthplace of Edward the Confessor whose father is\r\nsaid to have built a palace there. Its manor was an early endowment\r\ngiven by Edward to his newly-founded monastery of Westminster and, if\r\nold Thomas Hearne is to be believed, “the said mannour was formerly the\r\nbest wooded of any mannour that belonged to Westminster.”\r\n\r\nAs far back as the reign of Henry III. (1216-1272) there had been at\r\nIslip a small chantry chapel in memory of the Confessor which the same\r\nwriter tells us stood “a little way Northward from the church but\r\nfifteen yards in length and a little above seven in breadth.” It may be\r\nassumed that its character changed with the dissolution of the chantries\r\nin 1547, for it was afterwards turned into a barn and is shewn as such\r\nin an engraving in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ for December, 1788, but is\r\nrecorded there as having disappeared at least twenty years before.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of its first building the Abbot and Convent of Westminster\r\nhad appointed the chantry priest who ministered at its altar. The little\r\ntown had already been the birthplace of at least one great churchman in\r\nthe person of Simon, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1349, and\r\nhad given one monk to Westminster in the same century. The more\r\nconscientious of the chantry priests were wont to spend in the\r\neducation of children the considerable leisure that their duties allowed\r\nthem, and it is no great flight of fancy which imagines the first\r\ntraining of and the awakening of the first sense of vocation in John\r\nIslip as due to the teaching of such an one.\r\n\r\nOf his parents nothing is known, but from the fact that in 1496 he was\r\nhimself paying thirteen shillings and four pence quarterly from his\r\nsmall allowances for the board and education of his sister Agnes, with\r\nan additional shilling for her shoes and gaiters, it may be supposed\r\nthat they were by then no longer living. It was customary on entering\r\nthe monastery for the family name to be discarded and the place name\r\nused instead, so we know him only as “John Islip.”\r\n\r\nThe search for his patronymic yields nothing of certainty. For a moment\r\nit seems successful when in a document of the year 1506 we read the\r\nwords _Johannes de Pacientia Abbas_, but the hope is ludicrously\r\ndispelled when we find that but for scribal carelessness they would have\r\nread _Johannes Dei pacientia Abbas_. One possible clue may be given for\r\nwhat it is worth. In the second picture of the beautiful mortuary roll\r\nwhich was begun in Islip’s honour but which was destined never to be\r\ncompleted, St. Giles is depicted as standing alone on the right-hand\r\nside of the Abbot as he lay on his deathbed, while in the dexter corner\r\nof the base of the penwork which frames the Abbot’s portrait in the\r\nfirst picture are shewn the arms of the family of Giles, the sinister\r\ncorner being filled with the arms of the monastery. The significance of\r\nthe relative position of these two shields will be appreciated by the\r\nstudent of heraldry. It may be noted also that in the time of Islip’s\r\nrule as Abbot mention is found of a chapel of St. Giles[1] which seems\r\nto appear then for the first time and may well have been one of the\r\nradiating chapels of the apse of the new Lady Chapel built by Henry VII.\r\n\r\nThe connection between the monastery at Westminster and the town of\r\nIslip must have been kept alive not only by the chantry chapel and the\r\nsentiment that must needs have linked the places of the Confessor’s\r\nbirth and burial, but also by the visits which from time to time were\r\npaid to his manor by the Abbot or one of his officials. Doubtless many a\r\nrecruit was thus brought to the Abbey from one or other of its outlying\r\nestates. So it came to pass that John Islip entered the monastery on\r\nMarch 21st, the Feast of St. Benedict, 1480, and for six years--he\r\nrecords it himself as seven--lived the common life of the novice.\r\n\r\nHe was not yet sixteen years old and it may be supposed that the\r\nsomewhat confined character of the life of the cloister told for a time\r\non the health of the country-bred lad, for in the first three or four\r\nyears at Westminster he spent three considerable periods in the\r\ninfirmary, his first and most severe illness lasting more than two\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThe monastery at the time of his entrance was somewhat depleted in\r\nnumbers doubtless owing to the troublous years through which England had\r\nbeen passing. In the preceding decade only some ten novices had sought\r\nentrance and at the beginning of the year 1480 there were less than\r\nforty monks. In this year, however, there were eight admissions, and the\r\nnumber was never again to fall so low in Islip’s lifetime.\r\n\r\nThe Abbot was John Estney, a man of about sixty years of age who had\r\nruled the monastery already for six years and was to rule it for\r\neighteen more. To him in all probability more than to any other were due\r\nthe influences which were to shape Islip’s life, and indeed it may well\r\nhave been he who brought the boy to the monastery in the first place. He\r\nhad been a priest for thirty-eight years and had held most of the\r\noffices of importance in the community.\r\n\r\nFor a time the ways of Abbot and novice lay widely separated, but the\r\ninterest of the one and the ability of the other were destined within a\r\nfew years to bring them together in the closest contact. Estney was by\r\nno means the oldest of the monks either in years or seniority. Pride of\r\nplace in both respects was shared between three others. John\r\nAmondesham, priest and scholar, was now seventy-two years old at least.\r\nHe had been sent to the University of Oxford as a selected student as\r\nlong ago as the year 1432 and was reputed sufficiently learned to have\r\nbeen brought from there on two occasions to preach the Good Friday\r\nsermon before the monastery. He had never risen higher than the position\r\nof Sacrist, and that post he had long relinquished to spend his days\r\nquietly in one of the _cameræ_ of the Infirmary. When John Islip first\r\nsaw him he had but a year more of life left to him.\r\n\r\nContemporary with Amondesham were Richard Sporley and Richard Tedyngton,\r\nmen presumably of no more than mediocre ability though the former\r\nperhaps would have laid claim to some literary skill in the compilation\r\nof a history of the Abbey, derived mainly from the work of one who had\r\nbeen his fellow-monk, John Flete. It is a claim which the verdict of\r\nto-day will not allow. Old men were Brothers Sporley and Tedyngton but\r\nstill with some years of life before them.\r\n\r\nOf those who entered at about the same time as Islip three shewed\r\npromise enough to be sent to the University, but no one of them left any\r\nobvious mark afterwards upon the community at Westminster.\r\n\r\nThe life as a novice was one of strict discipline and considerable toil.\r\nUntil the rules of the new life were learnt in practice as well as\r\ntheory it may well have been irksome, as indeed all strict discipline\r\nmust be until it is seen as a means and not an end, as the necessary\r\ngrammar before the new language can unfold its beauties.\r\n\r\nThe customary period of the novitiate was seven years. During this time\r\nthe novice was under the sole care of the novice-master, through whose\r\nhands he received all his necessary clothing and bedding, supplied\r\nultimately by the Chamberlain. He received none of the monetary\r\nallowances made to professed monks, nor indeed was he allowed to handle\r\nmoney at all. His instruction came from the novice-master, who was to\r\nreport the matter if he shewed signs of special ability in order that\r\nhis claims to a university career might be considered, in accordance\r\nwith the Benedictine custom of sending to Oxford one in twenty of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe main subject in the educational system was of course the Latin\r\ntongue in order that a proper understanding might be acquired both of\r\nthe Scriptures and of the various orders of service. The latter indeed\r\nhad to be learnt by heart and the novice-master would hear the\r\nrepetition.\r\n\r\nJohn Islip would seem not to have shewn any great ability as a scholar,\r\nat least in Latin, for he was not one of those selected to proceed to\r\nthe university. He was sufficiently advanced, however, to be professed\r\nand ordained priest in his twenty-second year in accordance with a\r\nspecial privilege of the Westminster community. Scarcely had he said his\r\nfirst mass when he was appointed domestic chaplain to the Abbot and\r\nprobably at the same time to the office of Sub-almoner. The former\r\nappointment would bring him into intimate contact with a wider life than\r\nhe had hitherto known, while the latter would provide the first test of\r\nthose administrative abilities which might mark him in due course for\r\npromotion to higher offices.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the Abbot’s chaplain in these later years of the monastery\r\nof Westminster are nowhere defined. In the fourteenth-century Customary\r\nof Canterbury it is written that such chaplains should be polite,\r\ndiscreet and pleasant, especially to all strangers. They form as it were\r\na link between the Abbot and his Convent and are bidden to foster the\r\nlove of the Abbot to the Convent and that of the Convent to the Abbot.\r\nTheir other duties relate mainly to the due performance of masses in the\r\nprivate chapel and the general regulation of the Abbot’s household. At\r\nDurham it was the custom for the chaplain to be summoned to the bedside\r\nof a dying monk “who staied w^{th} him till he yealded y^{e} ghoste,”\r\nbut no such duty seems to have been required at Westminster, the Prior\r\nbeing deemed responsible for the last offices. It can, however, hardly\r\nbe wrong to assume that the position was one of tact and confidence as\r\nwell as of invaluable experience to a man who within a comparatively\r\nfew years was himself to occupy the Abbot’s place.\r\n\r\nAs Sub-almoner Islip’s duties were of a very practical character. His\r\nprimary responsibility was for the children of the almonry and of the\r\nsong school. These had their meals in common and were clothed and\r\neducated at the expense of the monastery. In due course the Sub-almoner\r\ntook them to London to be apprenticed to masters of different trades,\r\nand would use the opportunity to purchase russet-coloured fustian for\r\nthe coats of the “syngyng children,” with white cotton to line them,\r\nblack velvet to bind them, and “sylkyn poyntts” for further decoration.\r\nHis interest in the children did not end with their passing from his\r\nimmediate control, for visits were paid from time to time to their\r\nmasters and presents made in time of sickness.\r\n\r\nApparently the purchase of music books came into his department--if we\r\nmay judge from a payment of five shillings made on one occasion for a\r\n“pryksong booke of masses, antems and other songis.” Year by year on St.\r\nNicholas’ Eve and Day the festival of the Boy-Bishop was kept by the\r\nsinging children, and it was the Sub-almoner’s duty to provide the\r\nnecessary costumes as well as provisions for the festivity, such as\r\nmilk-bread, “cowmfetts,” and the like. New shoes and hosen were bought\r\nas well as gloves, and eight pence had to be provided for the\r\nBoy-Bishop’s offering at the shrine of St. Edward and the altar of Our\r\nLady of the Pew.\r\n\r\nThe singing children assisted at the high mass and evensong on all the\r\nprincipal feasts, and doubtless some of them developed a vocation for\r\nthe monastic life.\r\n\r\nBesides the charitable care exercised by the Sub-almoner over the\r\nchildren of the almonry and song school, he was in part also responsible\r\nfor the children of the Grammar School whose parents were not in need of\r\ncharity. The latter had a master of their own who was paid three\r\nshillings and four pence a quarter in money for his trouble, but\r\nprobably received his board and lodging in addition. The grammar\r\nchildren, as they are called uniformly both in monastic times and\r\nthroughout the years immediately succeeding the dissolution, find a\r\ncomplete continuity with the Westminster School of to-day, and it is in\r\nconsequence with no surprise that we read in a Sub-almoner’s notebook\r\nabout the year 1526 of the payment of sixteen pence for “wryttyng of a\r\nplay for the children.”\r\n\r\nAmong the officials responsible to the Sub-almoner were the butler and\r\nkeeper of the “Corde Hall” or _Corde_ as the monastic _Misericorde_ was\r\ncommonly called, and here it would seem the grammar children took their\r\nmeals.\r\n\r\nWith such cares as these Islip’s life can have been no idle one, though\r\nhe did not think it worth while to record in his diary anything of such\r\ncommonplace tasks. These were duties within the cloister so to speak,\r\nand he began his diary on his appointment to offices which would take\r\nhim farther afield and provide him with responsibilities to which his\r\nearlier duties might seem trivial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFROM 1492 TO 1498.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext in chronological sequence to the references in his diary to Islip’s\r\nearlier years is the brief entry that “on October 2, 1492 the King\r\ncrossed the sea and came to the town called _Le Slewse_ and afterwards\r\nwent as far as _Bulleyn_, and there was killed Lord John Savage, Knight,\r\nby the French, and various others, and in the month of December the King\r\nreturned.”\r\n\r\nWe may note first of all a point of some small historical interest. The\r\ndate of the King’s return to England is given as December 17th by Hall,\r\nStow, and other chroniclers, but the _Chronicle of Calais_ gives\r\nNovember 17th, a date with which Professor Pollard seems to concur, for\r\nhe says that there is nothing to account for Henry’s delay at Calais for\r\na whole month.[2] Islip of course does not account for it, but he must\r\nbe allowed to settle the month, for he had particular reason to\r\nremember it, apart from the fact that he was a diarist contemporary\r\nwith the event he was recording. Henry’s expedition was important enough\r\nin itself to call for chronicle, for it resulted in the long-delayed\r\npeace with France; but Islip recorded nothing that did not touch the\r\nmonastery directly or indirectly, and this was a matter of direct\r\nimportance to it as will presently appear.\r\n\r\nIn 1487 Henry VII. in a letter to the Pope related how a rumour of his\r\ndefeat and the dispersal of his army had been circulated in London and\r\nWestminster. “When this was heard by some of those who by reason of\r\ntheir crimes enjoy the privileges and immunities of Westminster, being\r\nof opinion that after the commission of any nefarious crime soever they\r\ncould have the free privilege of returning to that sanctuary ... took up\r\narms for the purpose of plundering the houses of those whom they knew to\r\nbe in the field with us and mustered in a body for the commission of\r\ncrime. Amongst their number was one John Swit who said: ‘And what matter\r\nthe censures of Church or Pontiff? Do you not perceive that interdicts\r\nof this sort are of no weight whatever, since you see with your own eyes\r\nthat those very men who obtained such in their own favour are routed and\r\nthat the whole anathema has recoiled upon their own heads?’ On\r\npronouncing these words he instantly fell dead upon the ground and his\r\nface and body immediately became blacker than soot itself.... Verily we\r\ngive thanks to Almighty God Who of His ineffable mercy has exhibited in\r\nour Kingdom so great a miracle concerning the Xtian faith.”\r\n\r\nMiracle or not--and some of its more repulsive details have been\r\nomitted--it will be seen that Henry had no love for the sanctuary men\r\nwho typified the very reverse of that law and order which he was\r\nendeavouring to establish. The Abbot was ultimately responsible for the\r\nsafe keeping of the sanctuary men, as well as for the convicts committed\r\nto his prison, and was doubtless duly censured by the King. Indeed he\r\nwould have had to obtain a royal pardon. Unfortunately at the end of\r\nSeptember, just as Henry was starting on his expedition, twelve convicts\r\nescaped from the Abbot’s prison.\r\n\r\nHenry was actually on the road but Prior Essex and others set out in hot\r\nhaste to catch him. They came up with him at Canterbury and asked for\r\nhis pardon. Henry, however, would not grant it, and told them he should\r\ndefer the matter until he returned from France and came to Westminster.\r\n\r\nIt can easily be imagined with what trepidation the Convent awaited the\r\nKing’s return, for they had reason to expect the severest penalties.\r\nTheir fears were not unjustified, for on February 9th, 1493, the matter\r\ncame before the King’s Bench and the Abbot was adjudged to pay the King\r\nno less than twelve hundred pounds. Such a sum could not immediately be\r\nforthcoming, and the Abbot accordingly entered into a bond for the\r\npayment.\r\n\r\nEventually, however, by the intervention of Sir Reginald Bray the King\r\nreduced the penalty to a thousand marks, the last instalments of which,\r\namounting in all to £166 13s. 4d., were paid off by Islip as Abbot’s\r\nReceiver in the year 1497. That Islip was correct in his note of the\r\nmonth of the King’s return may therefore well be credited.\r\n\r\nIslip goes on to record that in this same year, 1492, there died at\r\nBermondsey the lady Elizabeth, sometime queen and wife of Edward IV.\r\nAgain the matter is not one solely of external interest. On two\r\noccasions Elizabeth had sought sanctuary at Westminster. The first was\r\nin 1470 when with her daughters and Lady Scrope she had fled to the\r\nprecinct on the reverse of Edward IV. in that year. Here her son, Edward\r\nV., was born. Her food was sent from Abbot Milling’s household and the\r\nAbbot himself was godfather to the ill-fated child at his baptism by the\r\nSub-prior. When Edward returned in triumph to London she left to join\r\nhim, only to return some twelve years later with the young Duke of York.\r\n\r\nOn this second occasion she received the personal hospitality of Abbot\r\nEstney. Islip was but a novice at the time but he could not have helped\r\nknowing of the important events which were happening within the\r\nmonastery itself. Moreover Elizabeth’s name was already honoured in the\r\ncommunity as the donor of the new chapel of St. Erasmus erected in 1478,\r\nprobably at the west door of the old Lady Chapel.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1486 she was restored to her full rights as queen-dowager she\r\ncould think of no more pleasant place to live than in the monastery\r\nwhich had formerly sheltered her, and the Abbot’s house called\r\nCheyneygates (the present Deanery) was leased to her for forty years.\r\nShe lived there, however, but a few months, for in 1487 her lands were\r\nagain forfeited and she retired to end her days in the abbey of\r\nBermondsey.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of the year 1491, probably in the month of June, Prior\r\nRobert Essex died, and in July the Westminster students were summoned\r\nfrom Oxford to assist in the election of his successor. Among them was\r\nRoger Blake, and upon him fell the choice of the Convent. He survived\r\nhis appointment, however, only a few weeks, and by Michaelmas George\r\nFascet was appointed in his place.\r\n\r\nBlake as a student at Oxford had of course held no appointment within\r\nthe community, so that his election as Prior made no change in the roll\r\nof its officers. Fascet on the other hand held the two important\r\npositions of Treasurer and Monk-Bailiff as well as being Warden of the\r\nManors. These offices thus became vacant and in addition other changes\r\nwere taking place. William Mane who had held office along with Fascet\r\nboth as Treasurer and Warden of the Manors had been appointed Almoner.\r\nFor a short time he carried on the duties of Monk-Bailiff in place of\r\nFascet, but the total burden must have proved too heavy to bear, and\r\naccordingly on October 12th, 1492, John Islip was chosen to hold with\r\nhim the joint office of Warden of the Manors and along with Richard\r\nNewbery to succeed him and Fascet as Treasurers. At the same time Islip\r\ntook Mane’s place as Monk-Bailiff and Warden of the Churches.\r\n\r\nIslip was only twenty-eight years of age and there were twenty-three\r\nmonks senior to him in a community that numbered about fifty. It argues\r\nwell alike for his personal popularity and for the esteem in which his\r\nadministrative abilities must have been held by both Abbot and Convent\r\nthat the choice for such high offices should have fallen upon him.\r\n\r\nTwo attractive prospects were opened to him on his accession. As\r\nMonk-Bailiff he had separate apartments where his business could be\r\ntransacted and where on occasion he could entertain friends. Accordingly\r\nwe find in his diary for Sunday, February 10th, 1493, an entry which may\r\nbe translated: _I was at the High Mass but I did not sit in the\r\nRefectory because John Butler of Warwickshire and Thomas Candysse dined\r\nwith me in the Bailiff’s guest-room._\r\n\r\nStill more alluring perhaps to one in whom the life of the cloister can\r\nnever have stamped out the love of the open country was the necessary\r\nduty from time to time as Treasurer of making a tour of the various\r\nproperties of the monastery. It is not surprising that this should have\r\nbeen found necessary in his first year of office. Acquaintance with\r\nthese properties was certainly to be desired and there can have been no\r\nconflict between the call of duty which would take him again into the\r\nways of men and the cloistered conscience which would shut him from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSt. Benedict himself indeed sanctioned occasional absence from the\r\ncloister so long as the Abbot’s leave was first obtained. The novice\r\nvowed faithfulness to the monastery of his profession but not complete\r\nor permanent seclusion within its walls, and if it be urged that such\r\nprotracted absence as this of the new Treasurer would never have been\r\ncontemplated by St. Benedict it might with equal truth be argued that\r\nSt. Benedict could hardly be expected to foresee the acquirement of the\r\nscattered properties which made such absence necessary. In any case the\r\nBenedictine ideal of the monastery was the ideal of the self-contained\r\nfamily and would not be infringed in spirit at least by the necessary\r\nabsence on family business of one member of it.\r\n\r\nAccordingly after dinner on Sunday, June 30th, 1493, Islip set out on a\r\ntour which was to last nearly a month. On the first day he rode as far\r\nas Aldenham and held a court there on the Monday morning. Rising betimes\r\non Tuesday he rode as far as Berkhampstead to mass, dined with Master\r\nJohn Shorne and went on to Langton for the night, where he held a court\r\nthe next day. Thursday was a day of relaxation and he records that the\r\nwhole of it was spent in the forest hunting in company with Master\r\nLanxston and Master Gifford. Langton to Turweston and Banbury, Banbury\r\nto Warwick and Knowle, Coventry, Leicester, Oakham, Oundle, Huntingdon,\r\nso does he proceed, rising early and covering many miles before hearing\r\nhis daily mass and breaking his fast. Offord, Langford, Ashwell, Malden,\r\nFeering, Kelvedon, Benfleet, Romford, such are some further stages of\r\nhis journey. Only once did he spend more than one night in the same\r\nplace, so that the tour if pleasant was by no means dilatory. He reached\r\nhome again on July 24th.\r\n\r\nHe does not record what servants attended him, but the whole cost of his\r\njourney was two hundred and fifty-one marks, an average of ten marks a\r\nday, so that it is probable that such retinue accompanied him as\r\nbefitted the dignity of his office and the safety of his person. That\r\nsome such protection was necessary in those unsettled times will\r\npresently appear.\r\n\r\nFor the most part his tour was devoid of trouble incidental to the\r\nbusiness aspect of it. Only at South Benfleet had he reason to suspect\r\nthat anything was wrong. His suspicions were evidently corroborated\r\nafter his return to Westminster, for on August 11th he returned to South\r\nBenfleet and seized the goods of William Gose who was his “farmer” or\r\nagent for the manor and parsonage there. A careful inventory and\r\nvaluation was made of them, and they were reckoned to be worth just over\r\nforty-two pounds. Gose was evidently dismissed from office, for a little\r\nlater Islip records the handing over of the stores of the manor to\r\nThomas Petigrewe.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of the road have just been hinted at and he was a wise man\r\nwho kept to the King’s highway. That Islip had them in mind may be\r\nassumed from a long entry in his diary somewhat previous to his tour. It\r\nwas a story which he had heard at the Abbot’s table one Sunday from\r\nRichard Dolonde the Abbot’s guest. A certain priest with three servants\r\nhad wandered from the high road and come to Egerston at about eight\r\no’clock in the evening. When the priest’s groom went into the stable of\r\nthe inn to fetch straw for his horses he found beneath the straw two men\r\nlying dead. He came and told his master what he had found, and the\r\nlatter called the hostess and told her that he could not stay there that\r\nnight. She asked him the cause and said “The supper is prepared, the\r\nmeat killed and all things are ready, and now you will not wait, I\r\nmarvel strongly.” Then the priest pretended different reasons for his\r\ngoing and at last told her the true one, saying “I do not dare to stay\r\nthe night here for that two men lie dead in your stable.” She answered\r\n“This is the truth, don’t doubt it. It so happened yesterday towards\r\nnightfall two knights were here and their servants fought among\r\nthemselves so that these two men were killed, then the others in fear\r\nasked my husband and me to hide their bodies and bury them this night.\r\nThis we intend to do, so don’t fear.” The priest believed indeed that\r\nwhat the woman said was true and so stayed. But about nine o’clock the\r\npriest was lying on his bed, being unwilling to get into it because of\r\nhis fear, when the landlord came and knocked at the chamber door and\r\nsaid “Sir, I have brought you apples and pears and a draught of good\r\nwine.” Then the priest replied “I am in bed, I do not wish to drink\r\nto-night.” But the other said “Open the door that I may speak with you.”\r\nThen the priest said “No.” The other replied “Then I will break it.” So\r\nhe broke the door and came to the priest with eleven other men\r\nwell-armed and said “Seek pardon of your Creator for you shall die and\r\nall your servants,” who when he heard this asked that he might hear the\r\nconfessions of his servants. So he heard them and when confession was\r\ndone the priest came with his servants and but one dagger and rushed on\r\nthe men and killed nine of them. The other three were taken and hanged,\r\nand the wife was burned and so the priest escaped with his servants,\r\n“thanking God to Whom was the honour and the glory, Amen.”\r\n\r\nIt may be with such dangers in mind that Islip spent three pence on\r\narrows for his servant, Robert Seston. The latter received five\r\nshillings a quarter for his wages but was provided with clothing, shoes,\r\nand doubtless food also, at his master’s expense. In addition he might\r\nlook forward to a tip of twenty pence on Christmas day as well as on the\r\nanniversaries of Queen Eleanor and King Richard II. As Monk-Bailiff\r\nIslip had his own cook and outfit of kitchen utensils, while two grooms\r\nwere in his permanent employment to look after the needs of the seven or\r\neight horses living in his stables.\r\n\r\nIt might well be thought that the offices to which Islip had been\r\nappointed in the year 1492 would have provided him with but little\r\nleisure from their exercise to assume new duties. In the year 1496,\r\nhowever, William Brewode retired from the onerous position of Cellarer\r\nand Islip was elected in his place. The reason for this retirement does\r\nnot appear. Brewode was only fifty years of age and there was no\r\nsuggestion that he was unfit any longer to hold an office which he had\r\nhonourably filled for twelve years and which four years later he was to\r\nfill again for a brief space before becoming Warden of the Lady Chapel.\r\nIt may be that Islip was already so clearly marked out for promotion to\r\nthe highest places of all that it was thought well for him to have\r\nexperience of the widest possible character. This, however, is the\r\nmerest speculation, and the reason for the change must be left in\r\nobscurity. In the same year Islip appears in the _rôle_ of Abbot’s\r\nReceiver, a position he may have occupied for the four previous years\r\nthough no record of it has survived.\r\n\r\nIn the two years that followed no incident seems to have occurred of\r\nsufficient importance to call for special mention either in his own life\r\nor that of the monastery until the beginning of the year 1498, when a\r\nfew entries recall a story of some historical interest in which Islip\r\nwas directly involved.\r\n\r\nAs far back as the year 1415 Henry V. had directed in his Will that his\r\nbody was to be buried in the Abbey Church of St. Peter, Westminster,\r\namong the sepulchres of the Kings on the spot where the relics of the\r\nsaints were commonly kept. The beautiful chantry chapel which was\r\nafterwards built in his honour attests the care with which his direction\r\nwas carried out.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the fifteenth century, before the chapel was\r\nentirely completed, Henry VI. paid many visits to the Abbey church to\r\nsee his father’s tomb and select the site for his own, moved thereto by\r\nthe same love for St. Edward that had fixed his father’s choice. Many\r\nspots were suggested. Here he could lie, in the grave where Queen\r\nEleanor’s bones had so long rested. It would be no trouble to move her\r\ntomb. Or there in the Lady Chapel was a suitable place. True the tomb of\r\nhis mother Katharine must be moved further westwards, but then the\r\nopportunity could be used to see that it was more “honourably\r\napparelled.” Or why not move Henry V. a little to one side and so make\r\nroom for the son by the father? “Nay, let hym alone, he lieth lyke a\r\nnobyll prince, I wolle not troble hym.” In the same spirit did he reject\r\none suggestion after another, finally choosing a site on the north side\r\nof the Confessor’s Shrine, and John of Thirsk the Abbey mason was called\r\nupon to mark out the place with his pick.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, some twenty years later Henry died in the Tower his body\r\nwas taken first to the Abbey of Chertsey. In consequence of the story of\r\nmiracles wrought at his tomb Richard III. caused the coffin to be\r\nremoved to Windsor. In the ordinary course of events the story should\r\nend there. But a second chapter begins with the devotion to Henry’s\r\nmemory which began to spring up in the country, more especially in the\r\neast and north, within less than ten years from his death. Images of\r\nhim were set up in churches and lights burnt before them. New gilds were\r\nfounded in his honour and old gilds in one or two instances added his\r\nname to their dedications. He had already been canonised in the popular\r\nimagination before Henry VII. determined to secure that canonisation by\r\nauthority and build a shrine-chapel at Windsor where his body already\r\nrested.\r\n\r\nThe claims of Windsor were immediately contested by the Abbeys of\r\nChertsey and Westminster. On February 20th, 1498, the Abbot and Convent\r\nof Westminster petitioned the King _pro corpore beati viri Henrici\r\nSexti_. The matter was referred to the Lord Chancellor and the Privy\r\nCouncil, sitting in the Star Chamber and at Greenwich.\r\n\r\nProceedings began on February 26th and the Abbot of Chertsey was heard\r\nfirst. He advanced the subtle plea that the royal corpse had been\r\nforcibly exhumed and taken away without the consent of his convent by\r\nRichard who was King in fact but not in right, leaving it to be inferred\r\nthat such removal was therefore unlawful. The Dean and Chapter of\r\nWindsor followed. They had been wise enough to take advantage of the\r\ntraditional enmity between the Abbey of Westminster and the College of\r\nSt. Stephen in the royal palace. They found ready councillors in the\r\nDean and Canons of the latter foundation and learned probably from them\r\nthe form of the plea which it was intended to put forward on behalf of\r\nthe Abbey. They first of all contended that so far from the removal\r\nbeing against the will of the Chertsey monks the Abbot himself had\r\nactually assisted at the exhumation with his own hands. Moreover the\r\nKing had chosen his own place of sepulture at Windsor. They added that\r\nif no choice at all could be proved then possession ought to decide the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe Abbot of Westminster was represented by the Prior, George Fascet,\r\nand Islip as Monk-Bailiff. Islip was no stranger to the law, for in 1492\r\nhis name appears on the admission register of Gray’s Inn and in 1512 he\r\nwas regarded as among its most distinguished members.\r\n\r\nThe Westminster plea was first of all Henry’s own choice. A mass of\r\ntestimony was offered from the sworn statements of twelve different\r\nwitnesses who had been present at one or other of Henry’s visits to the\r\nAbbey church. This was a strong case in itself as it does not appear\r\nthat Windsor had any such evidence to offer. Secondly it was pleaded\r\nthat Westminster had for a long time been and still was the burial-place\r\nof Kings, and thirdly that since the Palace of Westminster was bound by\r\nboth practical and sentimental ties to the Abbey Henry was to be\r\nconsidered a parishioner.\r\n\r\nThe case was adjourned till March 2nd and Islip records the many\r\nincidental expenses to which he had been put for counsel’s opinion,\r\ntravelling costs and the like.\r\n\r\nJudgment was given on March 5th in favour of Westminster, on the ground\r\nof Henry’s own choice and because it was the burial-place of kings.\r\nNeedless to say the fact that the Yorkist Kings Edward IV. and Richard\r\nIII. were interred elsewhere was ignored.\r\n\r\nIt is from this judgment that we must date the first conception of the\r\nnew Lady Chapel, commonly known as the Chapel of Henry VII. Its\r\nfoundation-stone was not to be laid for four and a half years and in the\r\nmeanwhile its primary purpose was to disappear. In the meanwhile also\r\nfresh changes came into the life of the monastery, and the rest of the\r\nstory may well take its place in connection with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nISLIP AS PRIOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 24th, 1498, Abbot John Estney died. He had ruled the monastery\r\nfor twenty-four years and was nearly eighty years of age. There are\r\nindications that he had been for some time failing in health, and the\r\nfact that he had played no part in the action before the Privy Council\r\nin the matter of the burial of Henry VI. suggests that most of his\r\npowers had been by this time delegated to others. He had deserved well\r\nof the community and his loss must have been felt keenly by his sometime\r\nChaplain, John Islip.\r\n\r\nThe choice of the Convent fell upon Prior Fascet as Estney’s successor.\r\nHe was only about forty-two years old, but it must have been fairly\r\nclear from the first that the choice was made rather in view of his past\r\nservices than for any future benefit he could confer upon the\r\ncommunity. The plea of unfitness for the task that he made when the\r\nelection was first announced to him was more than merely formal. But a\r\nyear later and he was to forsake the independence of the abbatial manors\r\nand occupy the chamber in the monastic infirmary specially set apart for\r\nthose for whom there seemed some hope of restoration to health. For him,\r\nhowever, such restoration was not to be, and in the late summer of the\r\nyear 1500 he died. This is, however, to anticipate, and we must go back\r\nto his appointment to the Abbacy two years earlier.\r\n\r\nHe chose Islip as his successor in the office of Prior. It is at this\r\npoint in Islip’s career that one of the small difficulties in the\r\nreconstruction of mediæval monastic life presents itself. There were two\r\noccasions in a monk’s career at Westminster which were deemed worthy of\r\nespecial congratulation. The one was the celebration of his first mass\r\nafter ordination to the priesthood, following on the conclusion of his\r\nnoviciate, and the other when for the first time he sat _ad\r\nskillam_--“by the bell.” The _skilla_ was the bell which was sounded by\r\nthe Prior, or in his absence by the President, in the Refectory for\r\ngrace to be said, for the lection to begin or end, or for some other\r\nusual signal of the mealtime. To sit by the bell, therefore, primarily\r\nmeant to preside at the monastic meal.\r\n\r\nThe phrase, however, seems to have been used more loosely of those who\r\noccupied seats at the President’s table and thus to become capable of a\r\ncertain ambiguity. It was customary at Westminster for the heads of the\r\nvarious departments to make a present in money or in kind to a monk\r\nafter his first mass and his first sitting _ad skillam_. If we are to\r\nassume the wider meaning of the latter phrase it is impossible to\r\ndetermine what were the qualifications which a monk must possess or the\r\nperiod of probation through which he must pass before his promotion _ad\r\nskillam_. Islip was not thus advanced until he became Prior, when he\r\nmust inevitably so sit; so that the qualification was evidently not that\r\nof the holding of monastic office, however important. Moreover a survey\r\nof the careers of a large number of monks shews that anything from four\r\nto more than thirty years from their profession might elapse before such\r\npromotion came. For example Kirton did not sit _ad skillam_ until he\r\nbecame Abbot in 1440, thirty-two years after his first mass; while\r\nThomas Gedney passed to the high table in 1421, within five years of his\r\nprofession. Kirton indeed had spent some years of his monastic life at\r\nOxford and never occupied the position of Prior, yet it would be\r\nexpected that on one or other of his visits to Westminster he would be\r\nfound to have been sitting at the high table at a far earlier date.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the narrower meaning of the phrase, that of actually\r\npresiding in the Refectory, may be taken as indicating the occasion upon\r\nwhich _exenia_ or complimentary gifts were made, the difficulty to some\r\nextent disappears. Actual seniority of profession would then determine\r\nthe occasion of the gifts. A relatively young monk such as John Islip\r\nmight have sat at the high table long before some accident found him as\r\nthe senior monk present in the Refectory, and the same fate might befall\r\none many years older than himself. Moreover it seems probable from the\r\nfact that two tables were reserved for the senior monks in the Refectory\r\nin addition to the table of the President that the narrower\r\ninterpretation of the phrase as used at Westminster is the more correct.\r\nThis is borne out also by the fact that the phrase itself is found not\r\nonly in its ambiguous form as _primo sedente ad skyllam_ but also as\r\n_primo presidente ad skyllam_ which would seem to admit of no ambiguity\r\nat all. It is to be observed that the phrase is undoubtedly used in the\r\nnarrower sense at Westminster at the close of the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nThis digression is of some importance to a proper understanding of\r\nIslip’s career. It might be supposed that his early advancement to\r\nimportant offices had awakened some jealousy in the hearts of his\r\nfellows and had thus delayed his admission to the high table until as\r\nPrior he could no longer be excluded from it. That this was not the\r\ncase must be evident from the fact that two years later the brethren\r\nthemselves unanimously elected him to the highest office of all.\r\n\r\nOne further argument may be adduced. It is commonly said that the Abbot\r\nwas solely responsible for the appointment of monks to the different\r\noffices of the monastery.[3] In the case of Westminster this general\r\nrule requires some modification. From the time of Abbot Crispin to Abbot\r\nWenlock, that is to say from A.D. 1085 to 1307, it was indubitably the\r\ncustom for the prior and Convent to select two to four monks from whom\r\nthe Abbot might make his appointment to certain at least of the vacant\r\noffices. Since in all other respects the agreements between the\r\nWestminster Abbots and their monks continued in force in the centuries\r\nsucceeding Abbot Wenlock, there is no reason to suppose from the lack of\r\nevidence that this particular custom changed. It may be assumed\r\ntherefore with something more than probability that Islip represented\r\nthe selection of the monastery at most stages of his advancement.\r\n\r\nOn becoming Prior Islip resigned his offices as Treasurer, Monk-Bailiff\r\nand Warden of the Churches, all of which on occasion would take him\r\nabroad from the cloister. He retained, however, the duties of the\r\nCellarership, which was a more domestic office.\r\n\r\nAs Prior indeed he had to do the work which St. Benedict had designed\r\nfor the Abbot. He must be in practice what the Abbot was in theory--the\r\nfather of the Conventual family. As will appear later the Abbot,\r\nespecially of such a monastery as Westminster, was apt to be drawn into\r\nthe vortex of public affairs to an extent which left him little leisure\r\nfor the essential duties of his position. To some extent also it must be\r\nadmitted that the Prior did not share the full life of the brethren. He\r\nhad a separate house at the end of the Dark Cloister running parallel to\r\nand south of the Refectory.\r\n\r\nIslip himself has left little record of his own tenure of the office,\r\nbut if the documents which attest the story of his successor may be\r\ntaken as illustrative of the Prior’s life in general, it must be assumed\r\nthat his share in the common life was occasional rather than constant,\r\nwhile the existence of such officials as the Sub-prior and the third or\r\nfourth Priors points to a delegation of duties and a system which may\r\nhave worked well in practice but was not consonant with the Benedictine\r\nideal. Those who are familiar with the course of the development of the\r\ncollegiate life which Henry VIII. designed for his new foundation at\r\nWestminster in after-days will have observed the same forces at work in\r\nthe gradual isolation of the higher officials from the common table and\r\na somewhat quicker immersion in outside duties. It can hardly be doubted\r\nthat such forces are disruptive in tendency, not necessarily of the body\r\nitself, but of the purpose and ideal for which it was called into being.\r\n\r\nThe Prior in fact found little difficulty in an occasional absence of\r\ndays together from the monastery. A pilgrimage to the Rood of Grace at\r\nBoxley did not require any particular planning or arrangement, while the\r\nrecord of visitors entertained by “your mastership,” as Prior Mane’s\r\nfaithful steward was wont to call him, shews the independent character\r\nof the hospitality which he exercised. Whatever may have been the\r\nfrequency of his visits to the cloister Mane would seem seldom to have\r\ndined in the Refectory. He appears indeed as no unfit ruler of the house\r\nbut he stands aloof from it none the less, a figure to be regarded by\r\nthe younger brethren with more awe than love. There is nothing to shew\r\nthat such a life was regarded as other than normal or that his immediate\r\npredecessors had lived in other fashion.\r\n\r\nFascet had been Abbot little more than a fortnight when he signed an\r\nindenture binding himself and the Convent to pay Henry VII. the sum of\r\nfive hundred pounds, one hundred of which was to be paid at the\r\nfollowing Christmas and the remainder in two equal portions at the end\r\nof the ensuing years. The King had represented that he was about to be\r\nput to great expense both in obtaining the papal license for and the\r\nactual removal of the body of Henry VI. from Windsor to London. Moreover\r\nthe “diuerse other many and grete charges that our said souverain Lord\r\nmust bere by the chaunge and alteracion of suche thinges as his Highness\r\n... hadde ordeyned and purposed to have made and done within the said\r\nCollege of Wyndesore” formed an additional claim upon a Convent already\r\nsomewhat put to it to find money for other purposes.\r\n\r\nThe total sum was, however, paid in the year 1500-1, and John Islip as\r\nthe new Sacrist duly recorded it in his roll of account. The entry which\r\nhe made was apt to be misleading. Translated it would run thus: “Paid\r\nfor the removal of the body of the illustrious King Henry VI. from\r\nWindsor to the monastery of the Blessed Peter, Westminster.” It was\r\ndoubtless this entry that subsequently gave rise to the tradition that\r\nthe actual removal took place and the body laid in some temporary\r\nresting-place until the new chapel should be built as its shrine. The\r\nfact that the papal brief for the removal was not granted until May\r\n20th, 1504, would be by itself sufficient to disprove the tradition, but\r\nif further proof were needed it could be found in the Will of Henry\r\nVII., which was begun in 1509 and contained the note that the King\r\nproposes _right shortely to translate ... the bodie and reliques of our\r\nUncle of blessed memorie King Henry the VI^{th.}_\r\n\r\nFor some unknown reason the translation was never carried out. It has\r\nbeen suggested that the large sum of money demanded for canonisation\r\ncoupled with Henry’s parsimonious character proved sufficient to stay\r\nthe project; but there is no evidence for this conjecture and it seems\r\nmore reasonable to suppose that the canonisation was delayed until the\r\nnew chapel should be sufficiently ready to receive the body, otherwise\r\npilgrims would be flocking to Windsor rather than Westminster. Before\r\nthe chapel was thus ready Henry VII. died, and it may well be that his\r\nsuccessor had not the same interest in the matter as his father or the\r\nsame concern to defend his title to the throne.\r\n\r\nOne further item of interest may be noted here. The privy purse expenses\r\nof Henry VII. contain payments amounting in all to more than sixty-eight\r\npounds to Master Esterfelde for making the tomb of Henry VI. at Windsor,\r\nand a further payment to him of ten pounds for the actual conveyance of\r\nthis tomb to Westminster. Its ultimate fate, however, was never\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nWhatever might be the final decision of the Convent Abbot Fascet can\r\nhave had little doubt as to the proper person to succeed him. In a deed\r\nwhich is undated but which belongs probably to the year 1499 he\r\ndelegated to his Prior, John Islip, his full authority over the\r\nmonastery, and Islip became Abbot in fact if not yet in name. His end\r\nwas not far off, and in the summer of 1500 he died and was laid to rest\r\nin the Chapel of St. John Baptist.\r\n\r\nIn due course the royal license was issued to Islip as Prior to proceed\r\nto the election of an Abbot in his place. On October 26th the office of\r\nAbbot was formally declared vacant in the Chapter House. In addition to\r\nIslip some thirty-eight of the monks were present and also Dr. Richard\r\nRawlyns, a notary, Thomas Chamberlayn, and two representatives of the\r\nlaw, Doctor Edward Vaughan and Dr. William Haryngton. The election was\r\nfixed to take place on the following day though deliberation might be\r\nprolonged if it seemed desirable. Mass of the Holy Spirit was then\r\nsolemnly sung at the high altar and afterwards all assembled in Chapter.\r\n\r\nThe gathering of the brethren was larger by five than on the previous\r\nday, while Dr. Rawlyns, three legal representatives and a lay witness,\r\nEdmund Dudley, were in attendance. Dr. Rawlyns preached a solemn\r\ndiscourse on the text: _Instead of thy fathers thou shalt have children,\r\nwhom thou mayest make princes_. “Come, Holy Ghost” was then sung, with\r\nthe customary prayers following. The letters patent were read, the names\r\nof the brethren present scrutinised, proclamation made at the Chapter\r\nHouse door that any who had legal interest in the election should come\r\nin, and then Islip as Prior solemnly warned any who lay under\r\nexcommunication, suspension or interdict, or who were for any other\r\nreason disqualified to take part in the election, forthwith to depart.\r\n\r\nDr. Vaughan then formally inquired of the assembled Chapter by what\r\nmethod they desired the election to go forward. The reply was _per viam\r\nSpiritus Sancti_, and William Lambard, the senior of the monks present,\r\nnominated John Islip. The choice was immediately acclaimed by all the\r\nbrethren without discussion or consultation of any kind.\r\n\r\nLambard at once proceeded to make record of the election. Brother John\r\nIslip, he wrote, was a man careful and discreet, an ornament to the\r\npriesthood in life and habit, wise alike in things spiritual and\r\ntemporal, and anxious to preserve and defend the rights of the monastery\r\nof his choice. Procession was then formed to the high altar and _Te\r\nDeum_ sung the while. On reaching the altar Dr. Vaughan made public\r\nproclamation of the election. The brethren then returned to the Chapter\r\nHouse where the two seniors present, Brothers Lambard and Charyng, were\r\ndeputed to carry the formal announcement of his election to the Prior’s\r\nlodging whither the Abbot-elect had retired. Islip proclaimed himself\r\nunworthy of such high office but eventually consented to election\r\n_multipliciter se excusans_. He recorded his acceptance in this form:\r\n\r\n“In the name of God, Amen. I, John Islip, monk of the monastery of St.\r\nPeter Westminster directly attached to the Roman Church, of the order of\r\nSt. Benedict, vowed to the order and rule of the same in the said\r\nmonastery and canonically elected Abbot thereof, unwilling to resist the\r\ndivine will, at the urgent request of the Chapter of the said monastery\r\nand its proctors do consent to my election, in honour of Almighty God,\r\nthe Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Peter patron of the said monastery and the\r\nglorious Confessor St. Edward the King.”\r\n\r\nThe Abbot-elect would seem to have celebrated the occasion by giving a\r\nmodest dinner to the Convent if we may judge from the long list of\r\narticles of food purchased by the steward of his new household on that\r\nday. The cost amounted to seventeen shillings and ten pence and the list\r\nincluded “a potell of swet wyne”--bought perhaps to fill a loving-cup.\r\n\r\nSome formalities, however, were necessary before the Abbot-elect could\r\nbe installed. The papal confirmation had to be obtained as also various\r\nroyal grants of the Abbot’s temporalities. Some of the latter are dated\r\nNovember 13th and consist of mandates to the Crown escheators in various\r\ncounties to deliver the temporalities in their hands.\r\n\r\nMatters were sufficiently forward for the installation to be fixed for\r\nNovember 25th. The three days previous were spent by Islip at the\r\nAbbot’s Manor of Neyte, close to Westminster, where various presents of\r\nfood were made to him by his new tenants.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the day _when my lord was stalled_ he came from the\r\nChapel of St. Mary Magdalen at the far end of Tothill Street, then one\r\nof the chief highways of Westminster, with a great number of nobles,\r\nfriends and servants and was met in the Conventual cemetery just outside\r\nthe west door of the church by five of the senior brethren, Charyng,\r\nWaterden, Langley, Holand and Borough. Waterden handed him the oath\r\ncustomarily taken by the Abbots to observe “all the rights, statutes and\r\nlaudable constitutions and customs of the monastery.” He first read it\r\nthrough in a low tone and then recited it in a loud and clear voice.\r\nThen there came to him the Sub-prior and the rest of the monks with\r\nbook, cross and pastoral staff. He knelt and kissed the book and so was\r\nled in procession into the church where the installation was duly\r\nperformed. He subsequently gave a banquet at which probably the whole\r\nConvent was entertained, its cost amounting to no less than £4 13s. 7d.\r\n\r\nSo he entered on his new dignities. He was but thirty-six years old and\r\nthere were no less than sixteen of the brethren who were his seniors in\r\npoint of profession. Twenty years had seen him pass from the\r\ncountry-bred novice to the high position of a mitred Abbot at the\r\nopening of a century destined to bring to the Church changes greater\r\nthan any that had happened to it since St. Augustine first landed on the\r\nshores of Kent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nISLIP AS ABBOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing on his installation as Abbot, Islip was the recipient of\r\nvarious presents in money from the obedientiaries of the Abbey as well\r\nas of many in kind from friends outside.\r\n\r\nThe first month of office was spent quietly at Cheynygates and the\r\nearliest record of a visit abroad is contained in his steward’s note\r\nthat “this yere my lorde Abbot, the Prior, the monk bayly, and all the\r\nConvent kepe ther Crystemasse w^{t.} my seyd lord Abbott at his maner of\r\nNeyte.” The entertainment was of the most lavish character, in striking\r\ncontrast to the relative frugality of the Abbot’s ordinary household\r\nexpenses. Two oxen at 13s. 4d. each, seventeen sheep at 1s. 6d. each,\r\nnine pigs at 2s. each, twenty-seven geese, twenty-three capons,--such\r\nwere some of the purchases, while what may be called the bill for\r\ndessert came to £2 6s. 8d., the whole amounting to more than eight\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nFor a time the new Abbot found leisure to audit his household accounts\r\nand append his signature with its accustomed _rubrica_ thereto, but he\r\ndid not long continue the practice, perhaps because he found that he was\r\nbeing honestly served and more important matters were to hand. His\r\nsteward records that the second Christmas was spent at Hendon “and\r\nmaister prior and maister monk Bayly to gether at maister prior’s\r\nplace.” The latter facts were no business of his, but we are glad of his\r\ngossiping pen and shall have occasion to quote him again.\r\n\r\nIt is important to notice an innovation in the monastic system which\r\nIslip continued but which was initiated by Estney. The story of the\r\ncompletion of the building of the nave will be told later, so that it\r\nneed not be dwelt on now. In his anxiety for this work Estney on\r\nbecoming Abbot in 1474 retained in his hands the two offices of Sacrist\r\nand Warden of the New Work, as bearing directly on the building\r\noperations. This retention was continued by Fascet and Islip in turn.\r\nAll of them of course employed deputies to assist them but maintained\r\ncontrol of the funds of the two offices.\r\n\r\nEstney was the first Abbot to hold an office in the monastery, and it\r\nmust argue well for his personal influence or popularity that he was\r\nallowed to do so. In an earlier century such action would have been\r\nstrongly resented, so clearly defined were the relative positions and\r\nfunctions of ruler and ruled.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of no little difficulty to estimate the meaning and\r\nimportance of such an innovation. It is possible to read into it a\r\nsymptom of the declining vigour of monastic life, more especially in\r\nview of the fact that in the early sixteenth century the tendency was to\r\nunite various offices in one holder and so for many monks never to hold\r\noffice at all. But it does not seem necessary to invest Estney’s action\r\nwith any such indication of decay in strength on the part of those over\r\nwhom he ruled. The work of rebuilding the nave was the greatest\r\nenterprise of its kind which had ever been undertaken by the Abbot and\r\nConvent, and it might well be considered a sign of common sense that the\r\ntwo offices which were especially _ad hoc_ should have been allowed by\r\nthe Convent to be retained by the chief director and inspirer of the\r\ntask in hand. Delay and friction may have occurred in the previous years\r\nwhen there was divided responsibility. But when all is said it must be\r\nadmitted that the true significance of the innovation has not been\r\nadequately determined. For the purposes of the present story, however,\r\nthere is this advantage that the rolls of the retained offices provide\r\nmuch additional material for noting Islip’s personal activities.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Islip’s accession the financial management of the\r\nmonastery must have given occasion for anxious thought. The payment of\r\nroyal subsidies was shared between the incomes of the different offices\r\nand weighed heavily upon all, amounting roughly as it generally did to a\r\nfive per cent. tax upon diminishing receipts. For four years tithes had\r\ndecreased in value and in each of them the Sacrist’s roll had shewn a\r\ndeficit which in Islip’s first year had fortunately to some extent been\r\ncompensated for by an increase in the rents from Westminster property.\r\nAn annual payment of fifty shillings from the Royal Exchequer for the\r\nrenewal of candles about the tomb of Edward I.--a payment which had been\r\nmade for centuries--was discontinued in 1497, and not for seventeen\r\nyears did Islip secure its revival and then only for a time. Offerings\r\nat the different altars which in 1496 had amounted to more than\r\nforty-eight pounds had in 1500 shrunk to less than thirty-six.\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1509 Islip was unable to shew any credit balance in the\r\nSacrist’s account, though he gradually reduced the deficit. In that\r\nyear, however, occasions of special profit arose. The offerings at the\r\nburial of Henry VII. came to more than one hundred and forty-eight\r\npounds, those at the funeral of the lady Margaret his mother to\r\ntwenty-two, and the oblations at the High Altar at the subsequent\r\ncoronation of Henry VIII. and Katharine of Arragon to forty-seven.\r\n\r\nIslip, however, in the earlier years of his abbacy did not regard the\r\nneed for rigid economy as any excuse for the restriction of services. On\r\nthe other hand he would seem to have multiplied the number of masses\r\nsaid in the church, for while in his first year nineteen thousand\r\n“breads” were purchased for this purpose no less than twenty-nine\r\nthousand were required in the second. In 1504 considerable outlay was\r\nmade on the repair of vestments, lamps and other ornaments of the\r\nchurch, and there is in these years every evidence that there was no\r\nslackening at least of the external observances. Small items of\r\nexpenditure have their interest. Henry VII. would seem to have had a\r\nprivate apartment in the church, for in 1491 keys had been bought for\r\nhis seat and closet therein, while in 1504 there is a payment of four\r\npence for “teynterhokys and cordes for the travers of the lord king in\r\nthe church,” and a further expenditure of two pence for rosemary bought\r\nfor the King.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey church has been the scene of many a service of striking\r\nsplendour in the course of its long history but few of them can have\r\nrivalled in curious impressiveness that which took place in November of\r\nthe year 1515. Wolsey had attained the goal of his immediate though not\r\nof his ultimate desires, and on the fifteenth of the month his\r\ncardinal’s hat was brought in solemn procession through London to the\r\nAbbey church, where Islip and eight other Abbots received it and\r\nsolemnly laid it upon the High Altar. On Sunday the 18th Wolsey,\r\nattended by nobles and gentlemen, came from York Place to the church,\r\nwhere mass was solemnly sung by the Archbishop of Canterbury. There were\r\npresent the Archbishops of Armagh and Dublin, the Bishops of Lincoln,\r\nExeter, Winchester, Ely, Durham, Norwich and Llandaff, beside the Abbots\r\nof Westminster, St. Albans, Bury, Glastonbury, Reading, Gloucester,\r\nWinchcombe, Tewkesbury, and the Prior of Coventry. The sermon was\r\npreached by Colet, Dean of St. Paul’s, who is recorded to have said that\r\n“a cardinal represents the order of seraphim which continually burneth\r\nin the love of the glorious Trinity, and for these considerations a\r\ncardinal is apparelled only in red, which colour only betokeneth\r\nnobleness”--surely adulation enough even for Wolsey’s ambitious spirit!\r\nThe final prayers and benediction were pronounced by the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury over Wolsey’s prostrate form as “he lay grovelling” before\r\nthe High Altar, and at last the hat was placed on his head. It is\r\ninteresting for those acquainted with Abbey traditions to note that in\r\nthe recessional the cross was carried before the new cardinal though he\r\nwas not yet a papal legate, while no such distinction was accorded to\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey of Westminster was proud of its exemption from all but papal\r\njurisdiction. No bishops made there any disciplinary visitations. Wolsey\r\nbecame legate in 1518 and Polydore Vergil records that he made a\r\nvisitation of the Abbey in that year. Of this the Abbey records shew no\r\ntrace though notice was given of such visitation by Wolsey and\r\nCampeggio.\r\n\r\nOne document (a copy) which still survives and refers to that year\r\nbelongs probably to a later occasion. It is a roll on which appears as\r\ntitle _A Supplicacon of a monk of Westm’ to y^{e} beshop of Rome_. Its\r\npreamble begins:--“Pitteously complaynyth unto your most holly\r\nffatherhed, well of all remedy, hed and superyor of the spirytuall powr,\r\nyour pour suppliant and orator.” The monk remains anonymous, but his\r\ncomplaint is that in 1518 when Islip was Abbot and William Mane Prior it\r\nfortuned the said Prior to be robbed and spoiled of certain goods by a\r\nservant and kinsman of his own, “so being forth at a place of his called\r\nBelsaes.” When tidings was brought to Mane “he sayd strayth that it was\r\nmy arte and dede and put it holy to me that I had Robbed hym of lij lib.\r\nof plate and so incontynet went unto the abbot then lyeng at Hendon ...\r\nuppon the which I was ffet owt of my chamber by Dane John Chorysshe then\r\nbeyng his chapelayn which brougt me unto the prior, which prior\r\ncommandyd me unto ward in a sertayn chamber where I dyd contynue\r\nwithowte bed ... untyll the commnyg hom of the Abbot, at whose commyng\r\nI was examynd and then the prior had nothyng to say unto me but askyd me\r\nwher I had the iiij lib. that I did hend unto marshall of Barmysay wher\r\nas this I declaryd me to have it by the deth of my father ... the prior\r\ncomayndyd me ayenn unto the pryson untyll he had made dew prove thereof\r\nand in the meane season thabbot did return unto Hendon and at his\r\ncommyng ayenn whan the trowgh began to Appere they beyng asshamed of the\r\nsayd slander the abbot cam unto me and sayd Brother A.B. wyll you put\r\nthis matter unto my handis and I promyse yew I shall se yow have a great\r\nmense made, And forbycause I was under his obbedience I was content so\r\nto do but as yet I had never nothyng but toke by that means a great and\r\ngreavous sykenesse, at which tym of sycknesse it cam unto my lot to syng\r\nthe chapter masse, but I beyng dyseasyd durst not nor could not take it\r\nuppon me but yet w^{t.} compulcion he cawsyd me to do it, so it fortuned\r\nthe sayd day at masse at the Gospell tyme by the reason of that sycnesse\r\nso takyn to be so sycke that I sownyd at the Auter where at they were\r\nfayn to cut my gyrdell to revyue me, so that after masse as sone as I\r\ncam in to the revestery I was compelled to vomyt....\r\n\r\n“ ... And after that toke a sycnesse which held me iiij yeres. And where\r\nas ther is a howse cawlyd the farmary to kepe syck men in to the which\r\nther is a lowyd I lib, by the yere to be put to that use wher as every\r\noon beyng sycke iij d. by the day w^{t.} sertyn fagottis and other\r\nthyngis. your sayd suppliant had nether but lay at his owne cost utterly\r\nto his undoyng and to the poverysshement of his ffriendis....

We have\r\nonly one side of the case and it may have been true that he was no more\r\nsick than the Abbot’s horse! It may be that this petition was presented\r\nin 1525 when Wolsey signified his intention of holding a visitation of\r\nthe Abbey. Islip wrote a reply to the cardinal promising to be present\r\nwith all his monks. He admits the need of such visitations, for abbots,\r\nabbesses, and priors have become lax in their mode of life and\r\nobservance of rule, and lukewarm in their examples; while regulars who\r\nought to be models to the laity in life, in morals and good works, lead\r\nlives little corresponding thereto, to the great scandal of many. The\r\nletter is a disinterested comment on the monasticism of the day but it\r\nwould be foolish to draw any sweeping conclusion from it. Islip had\r\nconducted such visitations himself, and in 1516 had seen fit to suspend\r\na Prior of Malvern. No records of the result of Wolsey’s visit seem to\r\nremain beyond its cost, and doubtless he found little upon which to\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\nThe Benedictine custom of sending certain of their monks to Oxford has\r\nalready been mentioned. Towards the close of the thirteenth century\r\nGloucester College had been established there, to which a few years\r\nlater Westminster students began to be admitted. Among those in\r\nresidence there in 1522 was Thomas Barton, already a Doctor of Divinity\r\nand about to become Prior of the students of the college. An\r\ninteresting document survives in his handwriting which may be allowed to\r\nspeak for itself:\r\n\r\n“This byll testyfythe y^{t} we V scholars w^{th} other V w^{th} us of\r\ny^{e} brethrens of Gloster colege hathe expendyd yn y^{e} observaunce of\r\nholy sent Edwardis o^{r} patronys servisse kept at yslipe yn hys\r\nchappell & of y^{e} dyryge & massys kept y^{r} yn y^{e} paryshe churche\r\nfor y^{e} sowlys of y^{e} parentis of o^{r} most worshypfull spirituall\r\nfather y^{n} god y^{e} abotte of Wesminster the summe of x^{s} the yere\r\nof o^{r} lord a mcccccxxij^{ti} the xv^{th} day next after mykyl day\r\n\r\n    by me rudely wryt\r\n        Dan Thomas Barton\r\n             monk of Wesmynster”\r\n\r\nImmediately upon Barton’s appointment as Prior of the students Islip\r\nmade him a present of over four pounds, a typical instance both of his\r\npersonal generosity and of the interest which he shewed in the absent\r\nsons of his house.\r\n\r\nIn Islip’s time the monastery was represented also at Cambridge at the\r\nhostel called Buckingham College, which was founded in 1428 for\r\nBenedictine students drawn from monasteries in the eastern counties. The\r\nconnection of Westminster with Cambridge began in practice in 1499, just\r\nabout the time when Islip as Prior received the delegation of Abbot\r\nFascet’s powers. His interest in the Cambridge students is evident from\r\na letter which he wrote about the year 1524 to John Thaxted, Abbot of\r\nWalden, calling his attention to the condition of their college which\r\nwas without a rector, and expressing a wish that John Hastley, a student\r\nfrom Selby Abbey, might have leave to pursue his legal studies at St.\r\nNicholas’ Inn. The generosity of the Lady Margaret to the university was\r\nprobably not without its influence in strengthening the connection with\r\nWestminster.\r\n\r\nIslip, like many of his predecessors, had some unfortunate experiences\r\nin connection with the Gatehouse prison, for the security of which he\r\nwas personally responsible. In 1506 one John Calcote, Gentleman of\r\nLondon, who was in his charge on various accusations of felony, managed\r\nto escape from custody, and Islip was accordingly fined. Two years later\r\nGeorge Wolmer, Yeoman of Lingfield, fled for sanctuary to St. Mary\r\nOvery, Southwark. He was outlawed, but later on was arrested in England.\r\nHe pleaded benefit of clergy and was handed over to Islip’s care. On his\r\nsubsequent escape a Middlesex jury found a charge of negligent custody\r\nduly proved.\r\n\r\nYet the keeping of the gaol in spite of these and other instances of\r\nresultant trouble would seem to have been profitable, for Islip was\r\ndiligent in defending not only the rights of sanctuary but also the\r\nprivileges of receiving accused folk whether clerical or lay arrested\r\nwithin his jurisdiction, a diligence observable in subsequent centuries\r\nin those who took his place, though not his office. He was jealous too\r\nof his position as Abbot of Westminster, with all that that high office\r\ninvolved. For example, it chanced that he was present at a Chapter of\r\nthe Prior and Convent of Greater Malvern in 1529, perhaps on a\r\nvisitation, and he took the opportunity of professing certain of their\r\nnovices, but he was careful to make it understood that he was in no way\r\ndetracting from the old arrangement by which the Malvern monks must make\r\ntheir profession at Westminster.\r\n\r\nThe various inventories of the time and the records of the Augmentation\r\nOffice and Exchequer bear testimony to his generous gifts of vestments\r\nand ornaments to the Abbey church. The elaboration of his unfinished\r\nmortuary roll witnesses to the esteem in which his Convent held him. He\r\nwas the last of the great Abbots of Westminster, a not ignoble line, and\r\nit may confidently be asserted that his rule will bear comparison with\r\nthat of any of his predecessors.\r\n\r\nIt is natural to scan the Abbey records of his time for signs of the\r\napproaching cataclysm and equally natural perhaps to exaggerate the\r\nsignificance of their presence or absence. Among these records the signs\r\nare few. As long as Islip lived one might suppose from them that\r\nmonastic life at Westminster eight years before the dissolution of the\r\nmonastery was pursuing the same even and profitable course that it had\r\npursued half a century earlier when he first entered the monastery, and\r\nindeed that in some respects it was shewing even greater vigour. The\r\nenthusiasm for the internal work of the rebuilding of the nave and the\r\nexternal stimulus of the foundation of Henry VII. do not point to a\r\ncommunity anticipating any breaking of its bonds.\r\n\r\nYet it must be confessed that the materials for an accurate and\r\nwell-considered judgment are lacking. If a verdict must be passed on the\r\nevidence which exists it would be in favour of the supposition just\r\nmentioned. At the same time it must not be supposed that the community\r\nwas blind as to the general trend of the times or oblivious to the\r\npossibilities that awaited it.\r\n\r\nTwo things stand out in the last year of Islip’s life as pointing to the\r\nfact that the Convent was facing forces too strong for it. In 1531 it\r\nwas paying an annual bribe to Thomas Cromwell, a payment which was\r\neuphemistically called “a fee granted to him for the term of his natural\r\nlife,” the Sacrist’s share of which was £6 13s. 4d. The second\r\nindication lies in the unequal bargain made by Islip with the King in\r\nthe exchange of property. After Wolsey’s fall the King had annexed York\r\nPlace, ignoring the fact that it was the property of the northern\r\narchbishopric and not that of Wolsey himself. The larger portion of the\r\nresidential part of the Palace of Westminster had been destroyed by fire\r\nin 1512 and the King proposed enormous extensions to Whitehall, as his\r\nnew palace was now to be called. For these he must acquire the houses on\r\nboth sides of the street to the north and south of the existing\r\nbuildings. Most of these houses belonged to the Abbey and it can be\r\neasily imagined that Islip would be unable to withhold his assent to the\r\nscheme. He was employed along with Thomas Cromwell to pay compensation\r\nto evicted tenants, and in this way a sum of more than eleven hundred\r\npounds was disbursed. But the Convent itself received no adequate\r\ncompensation. Henry indeed gave it the Priory of Poughley in Berkshire,\r\none of the smaller houses which Wolsey had dissolved. Poughley had been\r\nfounded about 1160 by Ralph de Chaddleworth as a house for Austin Canons\r\nand in theory its revenues amounted to about seventy pounds. In actual\r\npractice the Abbey were worse off by some fifteen pounds a year.\r\n\r\nIt remains only to note one or two instances of Islip’s activities. When\r\nthe ancient college of St. Martin-le-Grand in London came into the\r\npossession of the Abbey at the beginning of the sixteenth century Islip\r\ndrew up new statutes for it, and the records of his dealing with this\r\nfoundation shew evidence of a shrewd business mind. From time to time\r\nhis name occurs in connection with the General Council of Benedictines\r\nof which he was President in 1527. On this occasion he issued a\r\ncommission to William, Abbot of Gloucester, to hold a visitation of the\r\nAbbey of Malmesbury where there had been a rebellion of the members of\r\nthe house against their Abbot. Towards the end of his life he was one of\r\nthe royal chaplains, but the record of his appointment does not appear.\r\n\r\nIslip died on Sunday, May 12th, 1532, at his manor house of Neyte, and\r\nwas buried four days later in the centre of his own chapel. So great was\r\nthe public interest in his funeral that its train is said to have\r\nstretched from Neyte to Tothill Street. The Abbot of Bury officiated at\r\nthe interment and pontificated at the mass of requiem on the day\r\nfollowing, the sermon being preached by the Vicar of Croydon. The\r\nreferences to Islip’s work as a builder which Hacket makes in his life\r\nof Bishop Williams may be very inaccurate, but there is no reason to\r\nquestion his estimate of Islip’s character as “a devout servant of\r\nChrist and of a wakeful conscience.” The last great Abbot of\r\nWestminster, it may be truly said of him that he was _felix\r\nopportunitate mortis_. His latter days may well have been full of\r\nanxiety, but he did not live to see the storm break or to suffer in the\r\nvast upheavals which were so soon to follow and which assuredly would\r\nhave broken his heart. But three days after his death the clergy in\r\nConvocation were forced to consent that they would neither enact nor\r\nenforce new canons without the royal initiative and assent. On the very\r\nday of his burial Sir Thomas More handed back the Great Seal to the\r\nKing. Islip’s funeral was “the funeral of the Middle Ages.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nISLIP IN PUBLIC LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe personality of the Abbot of Westminster can seldom have been a\r\nmatter of indifference to the reigning Sovereign. The mere proximity of\r\nCourt and monastery would alone be sufficient to ensure some degree of\r\nfriendship or provoke some measure of antagonism, and instances are not\r\nwanting of both. But when it is remembered that the Abbey church was the\r\nplace of burial of many and the place of coronation of all the Kings;\r\nthat it contained the saintly relics of one and owed its very structure\r\nto another, it is not surprising that at times Abbot and King should be\r\nbrought together in intimate contact.\r\n\r\nWhen Islip first became Abbot every circumstance combined to bring such\r\ncontact about. Henry VII. was half ready with the plans for his new\r\nchapel and Islip’s enthusiasm as a builder must already have been\r\nobvious. It may be supposed that Islip had already attracted the royal\r\nnotice by his share in the matter of the proposed translation of Henry\r\nVI., and the King’s assent to his election would seem to have been given\r\nreadily enough if we may judge by the relative lack of delay in issuing\r\nthe royal writs that dealt with the Abbot’s temporalities.\r\n\r\nOne small incident suggests that the new Abbot soon became on intimate\r\nterms with the King. Islip’s cook had evidently a reputation for the\r\nexcellence of his marrowbone puddings, for presents of such to the Lord\r\nChamberlain and others of his friends were not infrequent. Before Islip\r\nhad been Abbot for six months we find in his household accounts the\r\nrecord of the purchase of “ij marybons for ij podyngis for the Kyng.”\r\nThe cost was only two pence, but in skilled hands the value was\r\nevidently more. The present of a buck from one to the other would be a\r\nmatter of no surprise, but there is a certain intimacy, indefinable\r\nperhaps but none the less real, implied in so trivial a gift as that of\r\na marrowbone pudding.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later the Abbot’s steward notes that “the Kingis grace dyned\r\nat Cheynygate.” The cost of the entertainment was only 17s. 4d. and the\r\nfare provided was by no means elaborate. It was on a Friday so no meat\r\nwas served, and the only purchases unusual to the Abbot’s accounts were\r\nwine and strawberries which together cost 3s. 8d., a barrel of ale for\r\n2s. and a “potell of wyne for to Sowse ffysche w^{t.}” for 4d. The\r\nendowment of the King’s new chapel and the services to be performed in\r\nit when finished would have been a topic of interest to both and in\r\nitself have provided sufficient matter for conversation. A further\r\ninstance of friendly relations may be found in the royal presents to\r\nIslip of two tuns of wine yearly which began in the year 1501.\r\n\r\nIslip’s first entry into public life, so far as can be discovered, must\r\ndate from his appointment in 1504 as treasurer of the hospital of the\r\nSavoy, then about to be rebuilt by Henry VII. It does not appear that\r\nthe Abbot had any particular share in the work beyond the actual\r\nguardianship of the funds. The money came to him in sealed bags which\r\nwere probably deposited in the undercroft of the Chapter House. He might\r\nnot deliver them over without the royal warrant in Henry’s lifetime or\r\nan order signed by seven at least of Henry’s executors after his death.\r\nIn 1512 he had as much as ten thousand pounds in his keeping, the last\r\ninstalment of which he paid over late in the year 1515 when his\r\nconnection with the hospital came apparently to an end.\r\n\r\nThe trust which Henry VII. placed in him was continued by his successor,\r\nand in September, 1513, Islip appears as a member of the Privy Council\r\nof Henry VIII. Thomas Wolsey had been appointed to the Council two years\r\nbefore. The Abbot and the future Cardinal must, however, have been\r\nacquainted at an earlier date, for in 1505 Wolsey had been appointed a\r\nchaplain to Henry VII. In 1507 the Abbot and Convent had granted to Sir\r\nRichard Empson the parsonage and adjoining gardens of St. Bride’s, Fleet\r\nStreet, and when Empson fell the grant was given to Wolsey, who thus\r\nbecame a tenant of the Abbey. Moreover both Islip and Wolsey were among\r\nthe personal friends of Sir Reginald Bray, a favoured adviser of Henry\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nReference has been made elsewhere to Islip’s legal training. This was\r\ndoubtless responsible for his appointment in 1510 as a trier of\r\npetitions of England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland, an office which he\r\ncontinued to fill in the years that followed. In 1519 Wolsey deputed him\r\nalong with others to hear the causes of poor men depending in the Star\r\nChamber, while in 1512 and subsequent years his name appears on the\r\nCommission of Peace for the County of Middlesex.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor activities of these years may be included Islip’s work\r\nin 1524 as a Collector for Middlesex on behalf of the loan for the war\r\nwith France, and in 1526 as a Commissioner of Sewers from East Greenwich\r\nto Gravesend, work in which he was associated among others with Sir\r\nThomas More and Lord Cobham. It is interesting to note in the Navy List\r\nfor 1513 the Abbot of Westminster as part owner of the ship _Kateryn\r\nFortileza_, doubtless one of that gallant squadron which swept the\r\nChannel under Sir Edmund Howard and blockaded the port of Brest.\r\n\r\nLittle record remains of any activity Islip may have displayed in\r\nParliament. As a mitred abbot he was summoned to the assembly which met\r\nearly in 1515, and there is some evidence to shew that in 1523 he was\r\nnot a silent member, but his record in this connection is to be sought\r\nin the work of Parliament in general rather than in individual effort.\r\n\r\nElusive references to Islip in public documents are not infrequent in\r\nthe second decade of the sixteenth century, but it is not easy to place\r\nthem in their historical setting. For instance we find that he had\r\nevidently made a loan of some magnitude to his fellow Privy Councillor,\r\nthe Earl of Shrewsbury, but the purpose of the loan cannot be discovered\r\nand we note only the difficulty which Shrewsbury had in making repayment\r\nand the not unusual mode of behaviour on the part of the defaulting\r\ndebtor of sending a present of venison in place of an instalment of the\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nAt this time Islip would seem to have stood just on the outer fringe of\r\npublic affairs. He dined with Wolsey in 1516 to meet the ambassadors\r\nfrom Scotland, and in the summer of 1520, when the mission from France\r\nwas being shewn the sights of London, he “enterteigned” the three\r\ngentlemen that composed it with “right goodly chere,” for among those\r\nsights was the King’s new chapel at Westminster, not to mention the\r\nHospital of the Savoy. So, too, he visited the Princess Mary at\r\nRichmond and is able to report with the rest of the Privy Council that\r\nshe “is right merry and in prosperous health and state, daily exercising\r\nherself in virtuous pastimes.” The visit was followed by gifts of\r\npuddings, for the bringing of which the Abbot’s servants were duly\r\ntipped by the Princess. Again, on the occasion of the important visit of\r\nthe Emperor Charles V. to England in May, 1522, Islip was summoned along\r\nwith his brethren of Bury, Canterbury and Bermondsey, to attend Wolsey\r\nat Dover to meet him, but this must not be interpreted to imply that\r\nIslip had any share in the important matters that were to hand. It would\r\nbe but a compliment to his orthodox majesty to be met by representative\r\nChurchmen and to the Churchmen themselves to be asked to meet him.\r\n\r\nAmong the problems of the earlier Tudor period was one of interest at\r\nthe present time. There are no unimpeachable statistics as to the\r\nproportion of English land which was held by the Church but that\r\nproportion was undoubtedly large. Many of the monasteries were landlords\r\non a large scale and yet were suffering the pinch of severe poverty. The\r\nland was becoming denuded of tenants and rapidly passing from the plough\r\nto pasture. Increasing demands from the royal exchequer upon monastic\r\nhouses aggravated the evil and it has been well said that “debt with no\r\nchance of redemption weighed heavily upon all.”\r\n\r\nIt was a problem that Islip could view both with personal knowledge and\r\nofficial interest. It was a natural but at the same time an anomalous\r\nappointment which placed Islip in 1516 on a Commission among whose terms\r\nof reference were inquiries as to what towns, hamlets, houses and\r\nbuildings had been destroyed since 1489; what and how much land in\r\ncultivation in that year had since been converted into pasture; what\r\nnumber of parks had since been inclosed, and what land had been added to\r\nexisting parks. Islip was concerned in this inquiry with Middlesex only,\r\nbut that county included his own Manor of Hendon as well as other\r\nportions of the abbatial property, not to mention manors such as Ashford\r\nwhich belonged to his Convent.\r\n\r\nIn 1522 was levied the first of a series of loans designed to defray the\r\ncosts of ineffective foreign wars and Islip was associated with Sir\r\nAndrew Wyndsore and Thomas Docwra, the Prior of the Order of St. John,\r\nas a Commissioner for Middlesex. Theirs was the unpopular task of making\r\na list of all the residents in the county who possessed a yearly income\r\nof twenty pounds in goods or land, of ascertaining the total value of\r\ntheir property and assessing the tax due from them by way of loan. But\r\nif Islip had thus to deal with others he did not escape himself. His\r\nown contribution was one thousand pounds, equalling that of the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, a sum which by now he could ill afford. At the\r\nsame time he had to look forward to the payment of his share of an\r\nannual grant levied upon the whole spirituality of the kingdom for the\r\nKing’s expenses in France.\r\n\r\nIn 1525 Islip was sent by Wolsey to inquire into the affairs of the\r\nAbbey of Glastonbury. Abbot Richard Beere had died and considerable\r\ndelay had occurred in electing his successor. Finally the forty-seven\r\nmonks decided to remit the appointment to Wolsey who selected Richard\r\nWhiting, then Chamberlain of the Abbey, for the vacant office, doubtless\r\non Islip’s recommendation. It was perhaps well that Islip did not live\r\nto see the tragic fate that was to overtake the new Abbot.\r\n\r\nAnother side of Islip’s later life is seen in his occasional presence at\r\nthe trial of those accused of holding or promulgating heretical\r\ndoctrine. It is easy to-day to enlarge upon the bigotry and intolerance\r\nof the judges at such trials, and to make much of the unreliable stories\r\nof men such as Foxe. It is less easy but it is imperative for a proper\r\nunderstanding to make the necessary effort of imagination and place\r\noneself in the position of men faced with the spread of opinions which\r\nwere subversive of all that they believed true and all that they held\r\ndear, opinions which they thought to be destructive of a social order\r\nwhich they had long prized. It is foolish to defend them on the ground\r\nthat they but found men guilty or not guilty of offences for which the\r\ncivil and not the ecclesiastical arm awarded the punishment. They would\r\nhave scorned such a plea in their own defence. It is better to try to\r\nunderstand the point of view which could place men of such gentle\r\ncharacter as Thomas More in the position of apparent persecutors. The\r\nold order was changing, and the phenomena which accompany such changes,\r\nwhether ecclesiastical or social, are apt to be the same in every age\r\nthough they find expression in different modes of action. It is the form\r\nof expression which characterises the age rather than the phenomena\r\nwhich produce it.\r\n\r\nIslip’s first connection with such matters appears to have been in 1526,\r\nwhen Wolsey appointed him to search for heretics among the Hanseatic\r\nmerchants in London. The search was apparently successful, for he\r\npresided together with the Bishop of Bath and Wells at the trial of one\r\nHans Ellerdope, the main accusation against whom was the possession of\r\none of Luther’s prohibited treatises. The trial took place probably in\r\nthe Chapter House of the Abbey, for the Prior, the Archdeacon, and\r\nanother monk were all present. Ellerdope protested that he could neither\r\nspeak nor understand Latin. He had not therefore read a single page of\r\nthe book but had refrained from burning it because it was not his own\r\nproperty. He had found it in the chamber of one of his master’s agents\r\non whose death he had taken possession of it. The issue of the trial\r\ndoes not appear but it seems probable that Ellerdope was acquitted.\r\n\r\nIn 1527 the Chapter House was definitely the scene of a trial. On this\r\noccasion Wolsey, attended by a long array of bishops, lawyers and\r\nothers, presided there at the trial of one Thomas Bilney for heretical\r\npronouncements. Bilney is only of interest as being, according to Foxe,\r\n“a Cambridge man and the first Framer of that University in the\r\nknowledge of Christ.” More interesting would it be to have heard the\r\ntalk of the monastery upon the trial which was taking place in its very\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\nIn the last two years of his life Islip was connected with two more such\r\ntrials, both of which were held in the Consistory Court in St. Paul’s\r\nCathedral and were presided over by the Bishop of London. One of these\r\nwas that of Richard Bayfield, a renegade monk of Bury, against whom\r\nthirteen articles of offence were alleged. The more important items in\r\nthe indictment were the importation of the works of Luther and of divers\r\nother heretics, and the holding of opinions contrary to Holy Church. The\r\nAbbots of Westminster and Waltham together with certain of the nobility\r\nand others assisted the Bishop at the trial. Bayfield was found guilty\r\nand handed over to the Mayor and Sheriffs of London. In due course he\r\nsuffered at the stake. The second trial was that of a leather-seller,\r\nJohn Tewkesbury, who came to the same end, but in this case Islip seems\r\nonly to have been present at the first hearing.\r\n\r\nBut if this aspect of Islip’s public life is little calculated to\r\nattract the sympathies of more tolerant times still less perhaps is the\r\npart which he played in the matter of the King’s divorce. It was but a\r\nminor part, but there can be little doubt as to Islip’s views in the\r\ncase. No sadder fate fell to any woman in English history than came to\r\nKatharine of Arragon. Yet sympathy is apt to outrun judgment, and the\r\neasily formed verdict of all but the student dwells on the pathos of her\r\nstory, makes much of the King’s sensual inclinations, and is entirely\r\nuninterested in and impatient of the problems and niceties of\r\necclesiastical law.\r\n\r\nTo attempt some defence of Islip’s action is not necessarily to attempt\r\nthe same for Henry, though the efforts of the one were enlisted in the\r\nservice of the other. To a Churchman such as Islip, though not to the\r\nStatesman such as Wolsey, there was but one point at issue in the matter\r\nand that was the legality of the original dispensation for the marriage\r\nwhich Pope Julius II. had granted. This can hardly be too strongly\r\nemphasised if strict justice is to be done to men such as he was. In\r\nthis connection it is to be noted that eight of the foreign universities\r\nto whom the question was submitted and as to the general impartiality of\r\nwhose judgment there can be little question decided that the Pope’s\r\ndispensation was null and void. The verdicts of the English universities\r\nin Henry’s favour and those of the Spanish against him may be neglected\r\nas not uninfluenced by questions of expediency, but it is impossible to\r\nignore the importance of the decision of the others.\r\n\r\nIslip was present on two famous occasions in the year 1529: on May 31st,\r\nwhen the papal commission was presented to Cardinals Wolsey and\r\nCampeggio by the Bishop of Lincoln and a citation issued for the King\r\nand Queen to appear before their Court, and on June 18th, when the King\r\nappeared by proxies and Katharine attended in person to protest against\r\nthe Cardinal’s jurisdiction. In the furtherance of the King’s suit Islip\r\nwas employed with others to search for documents among the royal papers\r\nand to report on others in the possession of Garter King of Arms.\r\n\r\nOn July 13th, 1530, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal sent a petition to\r\nClement VII. praying him to grant the divorce “if it can be granted with\r\njustice.” This petition was signed by both Archbishops, by four Bishops\r\nand by twenty-two Abbots of whom Islip was one. The Pope’s difficulties\r\nin the matter are well known and the story of Islip’s connection with\r\nit may be concluded with the mention of the letter which the King wrote\r\non July 10th, 1531, telling Benet to suggest to the Pope that if he were\r\nafraid of the Emperor Charles, as he undoubtedly was, the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury might be appointed to judge of the matter. With the\r\nArchbishop might be associated the Abbot of Winchcombe or the Abbot of\r\nWestminster, “a good old father.” This suggestion of course came to\r\nnothing and Islip did not live to see the matter finally determined.\r\n\r\nSome time, however, before Henry’s letter Wolsey had died. Before his\r\nfall it had seemed for a moment that others would be involved with him\r\namong whom was Islip. In one of the indictments of Wolsey under the\r\n_Statute of Præmunire_, an undated copy of which is in the archives of\r\nthe Abbey, Islip was also charged. After setting forth the accusations\r\nagainst Wolsey the document may be translated somewhat thus:--\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless John, Abbot of the monastery of St. Peter, Westminster,\r\nlittle weighing the said statute, verily indeed setting it at naught,\r\nscheming and seeking after the said Cardinal in all his evil deeds,\r\njoined himself to him in a fuller and more extravagant use of his said\r\npowers and pretended legatine authority, and took him as his guide and\r\nalmost as his tutor and gradually undermined the laws of this realm and\r\nat last almost extinguished the same, with the result that the\r\naforesaid Cardinal bore himself the more loftily and insolently in his\r\nlegatine state and dignity. Upon a day at Westminster the said Abbot\r\nsubmitted himself to the Cardinal and accepted and approved the several\r\nlegatine faculties and professed obedience to the same Cardinal and\r\npromised it by a binding oath. And also he promised him the annates of\r\nhis exempt monastery right up to the Feast of the Annunciation, 20 Henr.\r\nVIII., and caused him to be paid in full at Westminster. And so the said\r\nAbbot abetted the said Cardinal in his contempt of the King....”\r\n\r\n_Præmunire_ was a convenient weapon in the King’s hands and he was\r\ngraciously pleased to pardon Islip with various others against whom\r\nsimilar indictments had been laid. The pardon in Islip’s case may have\r\nfacilitated the acquisition by the King of lands on which he had cast a\r\ncovetous eye, the story of which has already been told.\r\n\r\nSuch is the record of the part played in public affairs by a Westminster\r\nabbot in the later history of the monastery. Scanty as it is and\r\ndisconnected, it will yet be seen how that public life from which he\r\ncould hardly escape must have severed him from the spiritual duties\r\nwhich the Rule of his Order enjoined upon him. In justice to him it must\r\nbe said that he was the victim of a system which had developed too far\r\nfor him to be able to check it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nISLIP AS A BUILDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Islip died in 1532 the Abbey Church of St. Peter, Westminster, was\r\nalready (with the exception of Hawkesmoor’s addition of the incongruous\r\nwestern towers in the eighteenth century) substantially the church that\r\nexists to-day, but in order to understand Islip’s contribution to the\r\nbuildings as well as the structure erected to some extent independently\r\nof his personal initiative, it is necessary to go back to the time when\r\nHenry of Reims produced his plan for the new church which Henry III. had\r\ndesigned to erect on the site where for nearly two centuries the old\r\nNorman buildings of the Confessor had stood.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1220 a Lady Chapel had been begun at the east end of the\r\nNorman church, and when twenty-five years later the Norman apse had to\r\nmake way for Henry III.’s new structure the Lady Chapel must have been\r\nincorporated into the plan. When the King died the presbytery, choir,\r\nand transepts had been completed. In 1298 a disastrous fire destroyed\r\nthe greater part of the Conventual buildings, and thus work and money\r\nwhich might have gone to the completion of the church were diverted to\r\nthe rebuilding of the monastery.\r\n\r\nFor a century the Norman Nave served the Gothic church, but about the\r\nyear 1365 the rebuilding of the Nave was seriously undertaken on the\r\ninitiative of Simon Langham, who had been Abbot from 1349 to 1362 and\r\nsubsequently Bishop of Ely, Archbishop of Canterbury and Cardinal. The\r\nstory of Langham’s generosity does not belong to the present narrative\r\nand it must suffice to say that when Islip entered the monastery in 1480\r\na beginning was being made with the vaulting of three of the four\r\nwesternmost bays, while the final bay was already raised to the\r\ntriforium level. Abbot Estney’s enthusiasm for the work is obvious to\r\nany who can read between the lines in what are designed to be simple\r\nrecords of receipts and expenditure, and there can be little doubt that\r\nIslip caught the infection of that enthusiasm in the course of his\r\nassociation with the Abbot as his Chaplain. Abbot Fascet’s association\r\nwith the work was honourable if short, and consisted mainly in\r\ngenerously wiping out debts the payment of which he might legitimately\r\nhave charged on the fabric fund. It is not true as stated in Hacket’s\r\nlife of Bishop Williams that Islip was responsible for the whole\r\nrebuilding of the nave, but his was certainly the glory of its\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile at the other end of the church building of an entirely\r\ndifferent character was going on. It is hardly possible to emphasise too\r\nstrongly the contrast. At the west end were builders “original enough\r\nnot to seek after originality in their work,” continuing in the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries the style and plan laid down by Henry\r\nof Reims in the middle of the thirteenth. At the east end the new Lady\r\nChapel was being erected with all the glories of fan tracery in the most\r\nelaborate development of the Perpendicular. If further contrast be\r\ndesired it can be found in Islip’s contemporary building of the Jesus\r\nChapel, roughly midway in position and style between the severe and the\r\nornate beauties of the opposite ends of the church.\r\n\r\nThe west front of the church as Islip left it at his death may be seen\r\nin two pictures. The former of these is an inset into the elaborate\r\ncapital letter which should have begun the word _Titulus_ in Islip’s\r\nmortuary roll, destined unfortunately never to be carried further. Here\r\non the northern tower of the nave stands the great wheel by means of\r\nwhich the heavy stones were raised. It is perhaps no great matter if\r\nthis picture seems to shew the southern tower in a somewhat more\r\nadvanced stage than Hollar depicted it in his engravings of 1653 and\r\n1655.\r\n\r\nIn 1502 the Chapel of St. Erasmus was dismantled and the old Lady Chapel\r\ndemolished. The image and canopy of the Saint were placed by Islip over\r\nwhat is now the entrance of St. John the Baptist’s Chapel; and on\r\nJanuary 24th, 1503, Islip, attended by a distinguished company, laid the\r\nfoundation of the King’s new chapel.\r\n\r\nWith the disappearance of the old chapel went also the tombs of Abbot\r\nBerkyng and Queen Katharine of Valois, Henry’s “graunt Dame of right\r\nnoble memorie.” Her coffin was to lie unburied for more than two\r\ncenturies and a half. Within less than three weeks from the laying of\r\nthe stone Henry’s wife, Elizabeth of York, died at the Tower of London.\r\nHer body was brought in solemn procession a few days later as far as\r\nCharing Cross, where it was met by the Abbots of Westminster and\r\nBermondsey in full pontificals with the Convent of the former all vested\r\nin black copes. After the solemn censing of the corpse the procession\r\nmoved onwards to the Abbey church and the funeral service with a sermon\r\nby the Bishop of Rochester was duly performed. Then comes a gap in the\r\nstory, for the site of her immediate burial is unknown. Six years later\r\nher husband directed in his Will that the body of the Queen “be\r\ntranslated from the place where it nowe is buried and brought and laide\r\nwith oure bodye.” This was of course done, but as to the year and manner\r\nof it the records are perplexingly silent.\r\n\r\nIn the building of the new chapel the King’s mother, Margaret, Countess\r\nof Richmond, took considerable interest. At the end of the year 1496 she\r\nhad endowed a chantry for herself at the Shrine of St. Edward, and there\r\nmass was said daily for her good estate during life and for her soul\r\nafter death. She had planned also to found a chantry at Windsor in the\r\nnew work there, but it does not seem to have come into being, and it is\r\npossible, though there is no evidence to prove it, that with the adverse\r\njudgment given in the matter of the body of Henry VI. her eyes turned\r\nlike those of her son towards Westminster. It is certain that from\r\nEaster, 1505, a weekly mass was being said for her in the new foundation\r\nand it may therefore be supposed that the south aisle, rightly called\r\nthe Lady Margaret’s Chapel, must have been completed by that date. It is\r\ntrue that about the same time she had provided for masses to be said at\r\nthe old Lady Altar on the north side of the church until Henry the\r\nSeventh’s Chapel should be finished, but entries begin to occur\r\nreferring to the “King’s mother’s chapel” which preclude the possibility\r\nof any other identification.\r\n\r\nThis weekly mass fell to the monks in turn and the celebrant received\r\nthree shillings and four pence, which seems a generous endowment. It is\r\nnoteworthy that one shilling was being paid at this time for the weekly\r\nmass for Abbot Estney, probably in the Chapel of St. John Evangelist\r\nwhere he was buried, though the altar is not specified.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Margaret was indeed a generous benefactress of the new\r\nfoundation. She gave to the Abbot and Convent the churches of Cheshunt\r\nand Swineshead, of the yearly value of more than fifty-three pounds, for\r\nthe special purposes of the chantries, and also various lands at West\r\nDrayton and elsewhere, the proceeds of which the Abbot was to spend in\r\nthe salaries of divinity readerships at the universities, while in her\r\nWill she made gifts of various ornaments to “oure chapell at\r\nWestminster” as well as assigning legacies for masses. She is stated to\r\nhave built an almshouse for poor women in the Almonry by the Chapel of\r\nSt. Anne.\r\n\r\nOn St. Peter’s day, 1509, she died in the Abbot’s house, and Bolton,\r\nPrior of St. Bartholomew’s, was charged with the erection of her tomb.\r\nThe Sacrist of that year records the receipt of twenty-two pounds in\r\nmass-pence at her funeral.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements for the new foundation were of the most elaborate\r\ncharacter. For his own guidance Islip found it necessary to summarise\r\nthe long indenture made between the King and himself. Apart from the\r\nworship in the chapel itself Henry VII. was to be remembered daily both\r\nat the high mass and the Chapter mass. Ultimately the masses in the\r\nKing’s chapel were to be said only by bachelors or doctors of divinity,\r\nthough the Abbot, Prior, and Monk-Bailiff were to be excused this\r\nqualification.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the Abbot was bidden to cause the Oxford students of his\r\nmonastery to take these degrees as soon as might be and within three\r\nmonths thereafter to appoint them to the service of the King’s masses.\r\nThree additional monks above the present number of the monastery were to\r\nbe acquired and placed on the new foundation to say each a mass daily\r\nfor the King’s welfare in life and death. These three masses were to be\r\nsaid at the altar “under the lantern place” until the chapel should be\r\nready. The greatest bell was to be rung for forty strokes or above a\r\nquarter of an hour before each of these masses and from noon till one\r\no’clock before the preaching of certain “solemne sermondis” appointed\r\nfor various feasts and fasts. Once a year every priest in the monastery\r\nwas to say a mass of requiem with special collects and every lay-brother\r\nthe psalter of David or our Lady. Needless to say the most elaborate\r\ndirections were given as to tapers and torches. Various officials of the\r\nkingdom such as the Chancellor, Treasurer, Master of the Rolls, Barons\r\nof the Exchequer and Justices of the Benches were to receive fees if\r\nthey attended the anniversary. So too the Mayor of London, the Recorder\r\nand Sheriffs, for whom the costs of their barges were to be defrayed. In\r\ndefault of attendance the fees were to go to the prisoners in the King’s\r\nBench or “mareschalsy.” A weekly distribution of alms was provided for\r\nand an almshouse for thirteen poor men founded. Some nineteen other\r\nmonastic or collegiate foundations were to receive fees from the Abbot\r\nof Westminster for the performance of services, as well as the\r\nChancellor, Vice-Chancellor, Masters, and scholars of both universities.\r\nIt would be tedious to follow Islip’s summary of the duties in any more\r\nelaborate detail and it must suffice to add that specific forfeitures of\r\nmoney were prescribed for the neglect of any article contained therein.\r\n\r\nTo meet all these expenses the King’s endowment was generous. The\r\nDeanery of St. Martin-le-Grand, the Priory of Luffield, various manors\r\nand advowsons formed substantial gifts, while a sum of more than five\r\nthousand pounds in money was made over for the purchase of other\r\nestates. In the Orde MS. there is the entry of a payment of thirty\r\nthousand pounds for the purchase of lands for the King’s new chapel, but\r\nit is not possible to verify the accuracy of what is only a transcript\r\nfrom the privy purse expenses of the King. The same manuscript records\r\nin seventeen different items the payment of £9,844 18s. 3d. to the\r\nAbbot of Westminster for the carrying on of the building between October\r\n1st, 1502, and May 20th, 1505. A number of entries in the King’s Books\r\nof Payments (Treasury of Receipts) beginning in January, 1506, amount to\r\nmore than £11,188, and so the total expenditure on the new building was\r\ncertainly more than twenty-one thousand pounds. The last entry occurs on\r\nApril 15th, 1509, about a week before the King died. It would appear to\r\nbe a final payment for it refers to the _accomplishment and performing_\r\nof the chapel, while no entries of payments occur in the succeeding\r\nbook. It is unfortunate that it is not at present possible to do much\r\nmore than note the cost of the chapel and the years occupied in the\r\nbuilding, for the “reckonings” which were presented by Islip from time\r\nto time for the royal approval do not appear, though all probable\r\nsources have been searched.\r\n\r\nIslip would seem to have been the general supervisor of the works and\r\nresponsible for the disbursement of the money, but the building itself\r\nwas carried on under the direction of the royal workmen. One problem of\r\nthe greatest interest remains unsolved, and that is the identity of the\r\nmaster-mason or architect who made the original design and plan of the\r\nchapel. Among the names suggested have been John Alcock, Bishop of Ely\r\nfrom 1486 to 1501; Sir Reginald Bray; Richard Fox, Bishop of Winchester\r\nfrom 1501 to 1528, and even the King himself. Mr. Lethaby[4] assumes\r\nthat there can be no doubt that Robert Vertue, the senior royal mason,\r\nwas the architect, but in the absence of evidence the matter must remain\r\nunsolved. It is to be noted that the only person mentioned in the\r\ndirections as to the chapel given in the will of Henry VII. is the Prior\r\nof St. Bartholomew’s, Smithfield, who is described there as the master\r\nof the works of the said chapel. The reference is of course to Bolton\r\nwho was Prior from 1505 to 1532 and whose work in his own church may\r\nstill be seen. Stow refers to him as a great builder and in any\r\ndiscussion as to the identity of the architect his name must not be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nMention has been already made[5] of the “brassen” chapel or chapel\r\nwithin the grille surrounding the tomb of Henry VII. One reference to\r\nthis occurs in the Exchequer Accounts of September, 1505, where a\r\npayment is recorded of twenty pounds to “Thomas Ducheman Smith” for\r\ncopper-work for the “chapell of metal” at Westminster. This chapel is\r\nsaid to have been called St. Saviour’s, while the high altar of the new\r\nbuilding retained its dedication to the Blessed Virgin. The dedications\r\nof the chapels in the apse cannot be determined with certainty, but\r\namong them may well be St. Dionysius, St. Ursula and St. Giles, for\r\nchapels in honour of these find mention in the Sub-sacrist’s roll for\r\nthe year ending at Michaelmas, 1524. If the last-named chapel may be\r\nidentified with “o^{r} ffather Abbottes Chappell w^{t.} in the new\r\nchapell” for which the Sub-sacrist was wont to supply six candles a\r\nyear, there would be some slight additional reason for supposing that\r\nIslip’s family name was Giles.\r\n\r\nThe work of Torregiano in connection with the tomb of the royal founder\r\nis too well known to call for additional record.\r\n\r\nThe devotion of the Jesus mass, which began to be popular towards the\r\nclose of the fifteenth century, was in vogue at Westminster some years\r\nbefore the actual erection of the Jesus Chapel. For instance, in an\r\nindenture made between the Countess of Richmond and the Abbot and\r\nConvent in the year 1506 it was agreed that when her chapel was ready an\r\naltar should be erected there in honour of the Holy Name and the\r\nAnnunciation of the Blessed Virgin, and that among the masses said there\r\nshould be a Jesus mass every Friday.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear when the Jesus Chapel, now commonly known as the\r\nIslip chantry, was built. Its accounts, if they survive, are so\r\ninextricably mixed up with those of building in other parts of the\r\nchurch that it is impossible to separate them. We have, however, hints\r\nhere and there which suggest that it followed closely upon the\r\ncompletion of the chapel of Henry VII. It is certain that the Jesus\r\nChapel was in use before it was actually finished, for the Sub-sacrist\r\nnotes the provision of pound tapers to be burnt there at Christmas,\r\n1523, while two years later there is a record in the _Novum Opus_ roll\r\nof a payment for carving in the chapel. The final decoration was not\r\ncompleted until 1530, when Master Humfrey received the last instalment\r\nof the money owing to him for “payntyng uppon the wall in Ihs Chappell”\r\nand for some further work in connection with the Five Wounds which John\r\nEllys had made for the stairs. The Islip roll gives some faint\r\nindication of the painted Crucifixion on the eastern walls above the\r\naltars and shews also the medallion of the head of our Lord on the outer\r\nside of the western parapet. There is record that weekly masses were\r\nsaid for Islip after his death and these would naturally be performed in\r\nthe chapel where he lay buried, so that Islip’s chantry is a fitting\r\ndescription of it; but it is to be regretted that its earlier name and\r\ndedication should be relatively forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the nave and the building of this chapel do not form\r\nthe whole tale of work for which Islip was directly responsible. The\r\nsame document which records the payment for painting of the Jesus Chapel\r\nrefers to _my lordes chapell at Chenygates_. On the northern side of the\r\ncourtyard over part of the substructure of Abbot Litlyngton he built a\r\nset of rooms of two storeys and continued the building round the side of\r\nthe south-west tower, making a window into the nave of the church. The\r\nwhole of course forms a private part of the present Deanery, but the\r\npanelled chamber called Jericho Parlour which looks on to the courtyard\r\nis well enough known. The chapel at Cheynygates has been identified with\r\na chamber on the upper floor built in between the tower and the first\r\nbuttress of the nave.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the work in connection with the Abbey church and his own\r\nhouse Islip was called upon in 1518 to undertake the rebuilding of the\r\nchancel of St. Margaret’s Church, of which the Convent took the\r\nrectorial tithes. The rebuilding of that church had already occupied\r\nsome years of the previous century but had been carried on with a view\r\nto the least possible disturbance of parochial worship. The nave was\r\ncompleted before Islip was required to rebuild the chancel. It was work\r\nwhich he could not neglect, for the King had made a special grant of\r\nland to facilitate the extension of the church. In justice to him it\r\nmust be mentioned that there is no evidence to shew that he desired to\r\nescape his responsibilities. When in 1905 the chancel was still further\r\nextended the demolition of the east wall revealed two stones bearing\r\nIslip’s _rebus_ with which in some of its varying forms the visitor to\r\nthe Abbey church is familiar. These stones may still be seen\r\nincorporated into the east wall of the chancel of St. Margaret’s and in\r\nfact their pattern has been multiplied in the frieze of the wooden\r\npanelling.\r\n\r\nNo narrative of Islip’s work as a builder would be complete without some\r\nattempt, however slight, to indicate the debt which the world owes to\r\nthe activity which he and his immediate predecessors displayed. This can\r\nonly be estimated by a consideration of the Abbey church as it is with\r\nsome thought as to what it might have been. The conservatism with which\r\nthe later builders of the nave adhered to the original pattern has given\r\nto the church “a unity and a harmony which largely contribute to its\r\nspecial beauty.” So far as the interior of the church is concerned\r\nnothing could destroy this, for Islip lived to complete it. How much\r\nthat unity has been destroyed externally by the addition of Hawkesmoor’s\r\nwestern towers is sufficiently obvious, and we are left to conjecture\r\nthe possible fate of the interior also had its completion been left for\r\na later age. If Islip had not died when he did it is probable that the\r\nmarch of events would not have allowed him to finish the western front\r\nas he must have desired to do. That he lived to do so much must be a\r\nmatter of thankfulness to the many who love the place with\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST DAYS OF THE CONVENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The knell that tolled at Islip’s death was really a knell for the\r\nConvent itself.” The appointment of his successor was long delayed and\r\nit is probable that intrigue was rife in the matter. John Fulwell, then\r\nMonk-Bailiff, was evidently strong enough to assume considerable\r\nauthority in the monastery and it may well be that he looked to be\r\nappointed himself. On October 16th, 1532, he wrote to Cromwell reporting\r\nthat “all things in the sanctuary as well within the monastery as\r\nwithout are in due order, according to the advertisement you gave me\r\nwhen I was last with you in London. At your return I trust you shall not\r\nhear but that we shall deserve the King’s most gracious favour in our\r\nsuit.” Whatever may have been Fulwell’s hopes they were destined to be\r\ndisappointed as was an effort made three years later by his friends to\r\nbribe Cromwell into giving him the Priorship of Worcester.\r\n\r\nThe year drew to a close without any appointment to the vacancy, and not\r\nuntil May in the following year is there any certain news of its being\r\nfilled. On the twelfth of that month William Boston, a monk of\r\nPeterborough, took the oath in the Chancery Court to observe the\r\nconditions of the foundation of Henry VII. For three hundred years some\r\nson of the house had been chosen to rule over it. Boston was a stranger\r\nand it is doubtful if he obtained his office in a manner honourable to\r\nhimself or to those who procured it for him. Three of the abbatial\r\nmanors were mortgaged by him until he should have paid five hundred\r\npounds to Cromwell and Sir William Paulet who was Controller of the\r\nroyal household. It is perhaps unfair to blame him for the exchanges of\r\nland with the King by which the Abbey lost the manors of Hyde, Neyt and\r\nEye, together with Covent Garden, but it is the fact which is most\r\nremembered against him.\r\n\r\nIt was in his time and in his own Chapter House that the famous thrill\r\nof horror ran through the assembled Commons at the reading of the\r\n_Comperta_ or findings of the Commissioners employed to make a case\r\nagainst the monastic houses of England. How much credit may be given to\r\nthe findings of men who were themselves of a not too high standard of\r\nmorality and honesty we shall not attempt to determine. It must be\r\nsufficient to say that no breath of scandal touched Westminster. It was\r\na city set upon an hill which could not be hid, and its fall came for\r\nnone of those grosser sins alleged against some other houses.\r\n\r\nThe story of Abbot Boston’s rule cannot be told in any detail owing to\r\nthe lack of material. A kind of paralysis seems to have fallen on the\r\nmonastery with his election. Account rolls if written at all were left\r\nuntotalled, unbalanced and unaudited. He gathered into his own hands the\r\nmore important offices as they fell vacant, holding ultimately those of\r\nthe Sacrist, Cellarer, Warden of the New Work, Warden of the Lady\r\nChapel, and Domestic Treasurer. It would almost seem as if Boston had\r\nbeen brought in to undo all that Islip had wrought and deliberately to\r\nprovide an excuse for a dissolution which in Islip’s day would have been\r\nhard to find.\r\n\r\nUnder Cromwell’s influence and in obedience to his orders as\r\nVicar-General Boston allowed his monks to be absent from the monastery\r\non any plea of mental or bodily recreation. It was a subtle move thus to\r\nrecreate a desire for the world that had once been renounced. This and\r\nthe absence of any responsibility of office within the monastery were\r\nswift to sever the bonds of what in Islip’s day had been a family with\r\nbut little dissension, and the path to the final dissolution was an easy\r\none.\r\n\r\nOn January 16th, 1540, the deed of surrender was signed by Boston and\r\ntwenty-six of the brethren. The Abbot became Dean of the new collegiate\r\nfoundation and many of the house remained therein as prebendaries or\r\nminor canons. Among these was Thomas Elfrede, who was installed as ninth\r\nprebendary. To him the change cannot have brought much comfort.\r\nForty-two years previously he had taken part in Fascet’s election as\r\nAbbot, and he had been one of those who voted in 1500 for Islip. It\r\nwould be small wonder if his heart yearned for the older days and\r\nmisliked the new. There is a note of pathos in the request which the old\r\nman recorded in his Will that he should be buried by the south door of\r\nthe church in what was _sometyme the procession waye_, desiring to be\r\ncarried in death along the path he had trodden so many times in the more\r\npeaceful days of his profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIALS FOR CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTMINSTER ABBEY MUNIMENTS:\r\n\r\n     Rolls and Accounts of the Obedientiaries, 1480-1532.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS:\r\n\r\n     Bentley: _Excerpta Historica_, p. 404.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIALS FOR CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS:\r\n\r\n     _The Rites of Durham_: Surtees Society, 1902 Vol. II.\r\n\r\n     _Customary of St. Augustine’s Canterbury and St. Peter’s\r\n     Westminster_, Henry Bradshaw Society, Vol. I., 1902; Vol. II.,\r\n     1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTMINSTER ABBEY MUNIMENTS:\r\n\r\n     _Islip’s Diary_, Mun. 33290.\r\n\r\n     _Sub-Almoner’s Notebook_, Mun. 33301.\r\n\r\n     _Domesday Chartulary._\r\n\r\n     _Mortuary Roll of John Islip._\r\n\r\n     _Infirmarer’s Rolls_, 1480-84.\r\n\r\n     Muns. 9462, 12790, 6631 _dors._\r\n\r\n\r\nVOW ON PROFESSION.\r\n\r\n“Ego, frater N., promitto stabilitatem meam et conversionem morum meorum\r\net obedientiam secundum regulam Sancti Benedicti, coram Deo et Sanctis\r\nomnibus Ejus, in hoc monasterio quod est constructum in honore Beati\r\nPetri, Apostolorum principis, in presentia domini N. abbatis.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCOATS OF ARMS.\r\n\r\n     ISLIP Ermine, a fesse engrailed between three weasels, ensigned of\r\n     a jewelled mitre.\r\n\r\n     GILES Ermine, a fesse engrailed between three crosses formy fitchy,\r\n     three martlets on the fesse.\r\n\r\n[Hope: _Vetusta Monumenta_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIALS FOR CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS:\r\n\r\n     Pollard: _Henry VII._\r\n\r\n     Stanley: _Memorials of Westminster Abbey_.\r\n\r\n     Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1479.\r\n\r\n     Venetian State Papers.\r\n\r\n     _Archæologia_, 1914,\r\n\r\n     Sir William Hope: _The Funeral, Monument, and Chantry Chapel of\r\n     King Henry the Fifth_.\r\n\r\nSurtees Society, Vol. 35.\r\n\r\nDouthwaite: _Gray’s Inn_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTMINSTER ABBEY MUNIMENTS:\r\n\r\n     _Register Book_, I.\r\n\r\n     _Rolls of the Monk-Bailiff_, _passim._\r\n\r\n     _Islip’s Diary_, Mun. 33290.\r\n\r\n     _Depositions touching the site of the tomb of Henry VI._, Mun.\r\n     6389**.\r\n\r\n     _Judgment of the Privy Council_, Mun. 6389*.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIALS FOR CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS:\r\n\r\nDr. J.
