A great deal of the material has been\r\nput in form for publication, but at this stage the extent of the work\r\npresented an unexpected obstacle to its completion.\r\n\r\nTo print the whole in one alphabet would be more than could be\r\naccomplished except by the active co-operation of a willing band of\r\nworkers, and then the time required for such an undertaking, together\r\nwith the cost, almost seemed to debar the hope of ever completing\r\narrangements for its publication. Nevertheless, unless we have a\r\nscientific arrangement of the enormously scattered material and a close\r\ncomparison of the details of each item of folk-lore, it is next to\r\nimpossible to expect that the full truth which lies hidden in these\r\nremnants of the past may be revealed.\r\n\r\nDuring my preparation of a book of games for children it occurred to me\r\nthat to separate the whole of the games from the general body of\r\nfolk-lore and to make them a section of the proposed dictionary would be\r\nan advantageous step, as by arranging the larger groups of folk-lore in\r\nindependent sections the possibility of publishing the contemplated\r\ndictionary again seemed to revive. Accordingly, the original plan has\r\nbeen so far modified that these volumes will form the first section of\r\nthe dictionary, which, instead of being issued in one alphabet\r\nthroughout, will now be issued in sections, each section being arranged\r\nalphabetically.\r\n\r\nThe games included in this collection bear the important qualification\r\nof being nearly all Children's Games: that is to say, they were either\r\noriginally children's games since developed into games for adults, or\r\nthey were the more serious avocations of adults, which have since become\r\nchildren's games only. In both cases the transition is due to\r\ntraditional circumstances, and not to any formal arrangements. All\r\ninvented games of skill are therefore excluded from this collection, but\r\nit includes both indoor and outdoor games, and those played by both\r\ngirls and boys.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the collection has been made by myself, greatly through the\r\nkindness of many correspondents, to whom I cannot be sufficiently\r\ngrateful. In every case I have acknowledged my indebtedness, which,\r\nbesides being an act of justice, is a guarantee of the genuineness of\r\nthe collection. I have appended to this preface a list of the\r\ncollectors, together with the counties to which the games belong; but I\r\nmust particularly thank the Rev. W. Gregor, Mr. S. O. Addy, and Miss\r\nFowler, who very generously placed collections at my disposal, which had\r\nbeen prepared before they knew of my project; also Miss Burne, Miss L.\r\nE. Broadwood, and others, for kindly obtaining variants and tunes I\r\nshould not otherwise have received. To the many versions now printed for\r\nthe first time I have added either a complete transcript of, where\r\nnecessary, or a reference to, where that was sufficient, printed\r\nversions of games to be found in the well-known collections of Halliwell\r\nand Chambers, the publications of the Folk-lore and Dialect Societies,\r\nJamieson's, Nares', and Halliwell's Dictionaries, and other printed\r\nsources of information. When quoting from a printed authority, I have as\r\nfar as possible given the exact words, and have always given the\r\nreference. I had hoped to have covered in my collection the whole field\r\nof games as played by children in the United Kingdom, but it will be\r\nseen that many counties in each country are still unrepresented; and I\r\nshall be greatly indebted for any games from other places, which would\r\nhelp to make this collection more complete. The tunes of the games have\r\nbeen taken down, as sung by the children, either by myself or\r\ncorrespondents (except where otherwise stated), and are unaltered.\r\n\r\nThe games consist of two main divisions, which may be called\r\ndescriptive, and singing or choral. The descriptive games are arranged\r\nso as to give the most perfect type, and, where they occur, variable\r\ntypes in succession, followed, where possible, by any suggestions I have\r\nto make as to the possible origin of the game. The singing games are\r\narranged so as to give, first, the tunes; secondly, the different\r\nversions of the game-rhymes; thirdly, the method of playing; fourthly,\r\nan analysis of the game-rhymes on a plan arranged by my husband, and\r\nwhich is an entirely novel feature in discussing the history of games;\r\nfifthly, a discussion of the results of the analysis of the rhymes so\r\nfar as the different versions allow; and sixthly, an attempt to deduce\r\nfrom the evidence thus collected suggestions as to the probable origin\r\nof the game, together with such references to early authorities and\r\nother facts bearing upon the subject as help to elucidate the views\r\nexpressed. Where the method of playing the game is involved, or where\r\nthere are several changes in the forms, diagrams or illustrations, which\r\nhave been drawn by Mr. J. P. Emslie, are inserted in order to assist the\r\nreader to understand the different actions, and in one or two instances\r\nI have been able to give a facsimile reproduction of representations of\r\nthe games from early MSS. in the Bodleian and British Museum Libraries.\r\n\r\nAlthough none of the versions of the games now collected together are in\r\ntheir original form, but are more or less fragmentary, it cannot, I\r\nthink, fail to be noticed how extremely interesting these games are, not\r\nonly from the point of view of the means of amusement (and under this\r\nhead there can be no question of their interest), but as a means of\r\nobtaining an insight into many of the customs and beliefs of our\r\nancestors. Children do not invent, but they imitate or mimic very\r\nlargely, and in many of these games we have, there is little doubt,\r\nunconscious folk-dramas of events and customs which were at one time\r\nbeing enacted as a part of the serious concerns of life before the eyes\r\nof children many generations ago. As to the many points of interest\r\nunder this and other heads there is no occasion to dwell at length here,\r\nbecause the second volume will contain an appendix giving a complete\r\nanalysis of the incidents mentioned in the games, and an attempt to tell\r\nthe story of their origin and development, together with a comparison\r\nwith the games of children of foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe intense pleasure which the collection of these games has given me\r\nhas been considerably enhanced by the many expressions of the same kind\r\nof pleasure from correspondents who have helped me, it not being an\r\ninfrequent case for me to be thanked for reviving some of the keenest\r\npleasures experienced by the collector since childhood; and I cannot\r\nhelp thinking that, if these traditional games have the power of thus\r\nimparting pleasure after the lapse of many years, they must contain the\r\npower of giving an equal pleasure to those who may now learn them for\r\nthe first time.\r\n\r\nALICE BERTHA GOMME.\r\n\r\nBARNES COMMON, S.W.,\r\n\r\n_Jan. 1894_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF AUTHORITIES\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n  Halliwell's _Nursery Rhymes_.\r\n  Halliwell's _Dictionary_, ed. 1889.\r\n  Holloway's _Dictionary_, ed. 1838.\r\n  Strutt's _Sports and Pastimes_, ed. 1831.\r\n  Brand's _Popular Antiquities_, ed. 1875.\r\n  Nares' _Glossary_, ed. 1872.\r\n  Grose's _Dictionary_, 1823.\r\n  _Notes and Queries._\r\n  _Reliquary._\r\n  English Dialect Society Publications.\r\n  Folk-lore Society Publications, 1878-1892.\r\n\r\n  BEDFORDSHIRE--\r\n    Luton                         Mrs. Ashdown.\r\n    Roxton                        Miss Lumley.\r\n\r\n  BERKSHIRE                       Lowsley's _Glossary_.\r\n    Enborne                       Miss Kimber.\r\n    Fernham, Longcot              Miss I.

The first as he jumps says\r\n\"Accroshay,\" the second \"Ashotay,\" the third \"Assheflay,\" and the last\r\n\"Lament, lament, Leleeman's (or Leleena's) war.\" The boy who in jumping\r\nknocks off either of the things has to take the place of the\r\nstooper.--Cornwall (_Folk-lore Journal_, v. 58).\r\n\r\nSee \"Leap-frog.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAll-hid\r\n\r\n\"A meere children's pastime\" (_A Curtaine Lecture_, 1637, p. 206). This\r\nis no doubt the game of \"Hide and Seek,\" though Cotgrave apparently\r\nmakes it synonymous with \"Hoodman Blind.\" See Halliwell's _Dictionary_.\r\nIt is alluded to in Dekker's _Satiromastix_, \"Our unhansomed-fac'd Poet\r\ndoes play at Bo-peepes with your Grace, and cryes All-hidde, as boyes\r\ndoe.\" Tourneur, _Rev. Trag._, III., v. 82, \"A lady can at such Al-hid\r\nbeguile a wiser man,\" is quoted in Murray's _Dictionary_ as the first\r\nreference.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll a Row\r\n\r\n    All a row, a bendy bow,\r\n    Shoot at a pigeon and kill a crow;\r\n    Shoot at another and kill his brother;\r\n    Shoot again and kill a wren,\r\n    And that'll do for gentlemen.\r\n\r\n--Northall's _English Folk Rhymes_, p. 386.\r\n\r\nThis is a marching game for very little children, who follow each other\r\nin a row.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Halliwell gives the first two lines only (_Nursery Rhymes_, No.\r\ndxv., p. 101), and there is apparently no other record of this game. It\r\nis probably ancient, and formerly of some significance. It refers to\r\ndays of bows and arrows, and the allusion to the killing of the wren may\r\nhave reference to the Manx and Irish custom of hunting that bird.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll in the Well\r\n\r\nA juvenile game in Newcastle and the neighbourhood. A circle is made,\r\nabout eight inches in diameter, termed the well, in the centre of which\r\nis placed a wooden peg four inches long, with a button balanced on the\r\ntop. Those desirous of playing give buttons, marbles, or anything else,\r\naccording to agreement, for the privilege of throwing a short stick,\r\nwith which they are furnished, at the peg. Should the button fly out of\r\nthe ring, the player is entitled to double the stipulated value of what\r\nhe gives for the stick. The game is also practised at the Newcastle\r\nRaces and other places of amusement in the North with three pegs, which\r\nare put into three circular holes made in the ground about two feet\r\napart, and forming a triangle. In this case each hole contains a peg\r\nabout nine inches long, upon which are deposited either a small knife or\r\nsome copper. The person playing gives so much for each stick, and gets\r\nall the articles that are thrown off so as to fall on the outside of the\r\nholes.--Northumberland (Brockett's _North Country Glossary_).\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the Birds in the Air\r\n\r\nA Suffolk game, not described (Moor's _Suffolk Glossary_).

The Earls Heaton game is played by forming a ring, one child\r\nstanding in the centre. After the first verse is sung, a child from the\r\nring goes to the one in the centre. Then the rest of the verses are\r\nsung. The action to suit the words of the verses does not seem to have\r\nbeen kept up. In the Hampshire version, after the line \"As a bird upon a\r\ntree,\" the two children named pair off like sweethearts while the rest\r\nof the verse is being sung.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The analysis of the game rhymes is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  +---+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n  |   |        Hants.        |   Deptford (Kent).   |       Belfast.       |\r\n  +---+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n  | 1.|Village life.         |Village life.         |Hunting life.         |\r\n  | 2.|All the boys happy.   |All the boys happy.   |All lusty bachelors.  |\r\n  | 3.|Except [   ], who     |Except [   ], who     |Except [   ], who     |\r\n  |   |wants a wife.         |wants a wife.         |courts [   ].         |\r\n  | 4.|He shall court [   ]. |He shall court [   ]. |He courted [   ].     |\r\n  | 5.|Huddles and cuddles,  |Kisses and cuddles,   |Huggled andguggled,   |\r\n  |   |and sits on his knee. |and sits on his knee. |and took on his knee. |\r\n  | 6.|     --               |     --               |     --               |\r\n  | 7.|Mutual expressions of |Mutual expressions of |     --               |\r\n  |   |love.                 |love.                 |                      |\r\n  | 8.|     --               |     --               |Asking to marry.      |\r\n  | 9.|Wife makes a pudding. |Girl makes a pudding. |Girl makes a pudding. |\r\n  |10.|Husband cuts a slice. |Boy cuts a slice.     |Asks boy to taste.    |\r\n  |11.|Fixing of wedding day.|Fixing of wedding day.|Fixing of wedding day.|\r\n  |12.|Wife in carriage,     |Wife with domestic    |Bride with rings on   |\r\n  |   |husband in cart.      |utensils.             |fingers and bells on  |\r\n  |   |                      |                      |toes.                 |\r\n  |13.|     --               |Grief if wife should  |     --               |\r\n  |   |                      |die.                  |                      |\r\n  |14.|     --               |     --               |Bride with a baby.    |\r\n  |15.|     --               |Doctor, cat, and      |     --               |\r\n  |   |                      |devil.                |                      |\r\n  |16.|     --               |     --               |Applause for the      |\r\n  |   |                      |                      |bride.                |\r\n  +---+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n\r\n  +---+----------------------+\r\n  |   |Earls Heaton (Yorks.).|\r\n  +---+----------------------+\r\n  | 1.|Roving life.          |\r\n  | 2.|     --               |\r\n  | 3.|     --               |\r\n  | 4.|Seeks for a bride.    |\r\n  | 5.|     --               |\r\n  | 6.|Catch the bride.      |\r\n  | 7.|     --               |\r\n  | 8.|     --               |\r\n  | 9.|Girl makes a pudding. |\r\n  |10.|Asks boy to taste.    |\r\n  |11.|Fixing of wedding day.|\r\n  |12.|     --               |\r\n  |13.|     --               |\r\n  |14.|     --               |\r\n  |15.|     --               |\r\n  |16.|Applause for bride.   |\r\n  +---+----------------------+\r\n\r\nIt appears by the analysis that all the incidents of the Hants version\r\nof this game occur in one or other of the versions, and these incidents\r\ntherefore may probably be typical of the game. This view would exclude\r\nthe important incidents of bride capture in the Earls Heaton version;\r\nthe bride having a baby in the Belfast version, and the two minor\r\nincidents in the Deptford version (Nos. 13 and 15 in the analysis),\r\nwhich are obviously supplemental. Chambers, in his _Popular Rhymes of\r\nScotland_, pp. 119, 137, gives two versions of a courtship dance which\r\nare not unlike the words of this game, though they do not contain the\r\nprincipal incidents. Northall, in his _English Folk Rhymes_, p. 363, has\r\nsome verses of a similar import, but not those of the game. W. Allingham\r\nseems to have used this rhyme as the commencement of one of his ballads,\r\n\"Up the airy mountain.\"\r\n\r\n(_d_) The game is clearly a marriage game. It introduces two important\r\ndetails in the betrothal ceremony, inasmuch as the \"huddling and\r\ncuddling\" is typical of the rude customs at marriage ceremonies once\r\nprevalent in Yorkshire, the northern counties, and Wales, while the\r\nmaking of the pudding by the bride and the subsequent eating together,\r\nare clearly analogies to the bridal-cake ceremony. In Wales, the custom\r\nknown as \"bundling\" allowed the betrothing parties to go to bed in their\r\nclothes (Brand, ii. 98). In Yorkshire, the bridal cake was always made\r\nby the bride. The rudeness of the dialogue seems to be remarkably\r\nnoticeable in this game.\r\n\r\nSee \"Mary mixed a Pudding up,\" \"Oliver, Oliver, follow the King.\"\r\n\r\n  [1] Miss Chase says, \"I think the order of verses is right; the\r\n      children hesitated a little.\"\r\n\r\n  [2] Mr. Hardy says, \"This was sung to me by a girl at Earls Heaton or\r\n      Soothill Nether. Another version commences with the last verse,\r\n      continues with the first, and concludes with the second.

H. Ballantyne).\r\n\r\n(_b_) Mr. Ballantyne describes the dance as taking place at the end of a\r\ncountry ball. The lads all sat on one side and the girls on the other.\r\nIt began with a boy taking a handkerchief and dancing before the girls,\r\nsinging the first verse (fig. 1). Selecting one of the girls, he threw\r\nthe handkerchief into her lap, or put it round her neck, holding both\r\nends himself. Some spread the handkerchief on the floor at the feet of\r\nthe girl. The object in either case was to secure a kiss, which,\r\nhowever, was not given without a struggle, the girls cheering their\r\ncompanion at every unsuccessful attempt which the boy made (fig. 2). A\r\ngirl then took the handkerchief, singing the next verse (fig. 3), and\r\nhaving thrown the handkerchief to one of the boys, she went off to her\r\nown side among the girls, and was pursued by the chosen boy (fig. 4).\r\nWhen all were thus paired, they formed into line, facing each other, and\r\ndanced somewhat like the country dance of Sir Roger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\n(_c_) Chambers' _Popular Rhymes_, p. 36, gives a slightly different\r\nversion of the verses, and says they were sung by children at their\r\nsports in Glasgow. Mactaggart alludes to this game as \"'Bumpkin Brawly,'\r\nan old dance, the dance which always ends balls; the same with the\r\n'Cushion' almost.\"\r\n\r\n    Wha learned you to dance,\r\n    You to dance, you to dance,\r\n    Wha learned you to dance\r\n    A country bumpkin brawly?\r\n\r\n    My mither learned me when I was young,\r\n    When I was young, when I was young,\r\n    My mither learned me when I was young,\r\n    The country bumpkin brawly.\r\n\r\nThe tune of this song is always played to the dance, says Mactaggart,\r\nbut he does not record the tune. _To bab_, in Lowland Scottish, is\r\ndefined by Jamieson to mean \"to play backward and forward loosely; to\r\ndance.\" Hence he adds, \"Bab at the bowster, or Bab wi' the bowster, a\r\nvery old Scottish dance, now almost out of use; formerly the last dance\r\nat weddings and merry-makings.\" Mr. Ballantyne says that a bolster or\r\npillow was at one time always used. One correspondent of _N. and Q._,\r\nii. 518, says it is now (1850) danced with a handkerchief instead of a\r\ncushion as formerly, and no words are used, but later correspondents\r\ncontradict this. See also _N. and Q._, iii. 282.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Two important suggestions occur as to this game. First, that the\r\ndance was originally the indication at a marriage ceremony for the bride\r\nand bridegroom to retire with \"the bowster\" to the nuptial couch.\r\nSecondly, that it has degenerated in Southern Britain to the ordinary\r\n\"Drop Handkerchief\" games of kiss in the ring. The preservation of this\r\n\"Bab at the Bowster\" example gives the clue both to the origin of the\r\npresent game in an obsolete marriage custom, and to the descent of the\r\ngame to its latest form. See \"Cushion Dance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBad\r\n\r\nA rude kind of \"Cricket,\" played with a bat and a ball, usually with\r\nwall toppings for wickets. \"Bad\" seems to be the pronunciation or\r\nvariation of \"Bat.\" Halliwell says it was a rude game, formerly common\r\nin Yorkshire, and probably resembling the game of \"Cat.\" There is such a\r\ngame played now, but it is called \"Pig.\"--Easther's _Almondbury\r\nGlossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaddin\r\n\r\nThe game of \"Hockey\" in Cheshire.--Holland's _Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBadger the Bear\r\n\r\nA rough game, sometimes seen in the country. The boy who personates the\r\nBear performs his part on his hands and knees, and is prevented from\r\ngetting away by a string. It is the part of another boy, his Keeper, to\r\ndefend him from the attacks of the others.--Halliwell's _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\nThis is a boys' game, and is called \"Buffet the Bear.\" It may be taken\r\npart in by any number. One boy--the Bear--goes down on all fours, and\r\nlowers his head towards his breast as much as possible. Into his hand is\r\nplaced one end of a piece of cord, and another boy, called the Keeper,\r\ntakes hold of the other end in one hand, while he has in the other his\r\ncap. The other boys stand round, some with their caps in hand, and\r\nothers with their neckties or pocket-handkerchiefs, and on a given\r\nsignal they rush on the Bear and pelt him, trying specially to buffet\r\nhim about the ears and face, whilst the Keeper does his best to protect\r\nhis charge. If he happens to strike a boy, that boy becomes the Bear,\r\nand the former Bear becomes the Keeper, and so on the game goes.--Keith,\r\nBanffshire (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\nI saw this game played on Barnes Green, Surrey, on 25th August 1892. The\r\nboys, instead of using their hats, had pieces of leather tied to a\r\nstring, with which they struck the Bear on the back. They could only\r\nbegin when the Keeper cried, \"My Bear is free.\" If they struck at any\r\nother time, the striker became the Bear. It is called \"Baste the\r\nBear.\"--A. B. Gomme.\r\n\r\nChambers (_Popular Rhymes_, p. 128) describes this game under the title\r\nof \"The Craw.\" It was played precisely in the same way as the Barnes\r\ngame. The boy who holds the end of the long strap has also a hard\r\ntwisted handkerchief, called the _cout_; with this cout he defends the\r\nCraw against the attacks of the other boys, who also have similar couts.\r\nBefore beginning, the Guard of the Craw must call out--\r\n\r\n    Ane, twa, three, my Craw's free.\r\n\r\nThe first one he strikes becomes the Craw. When the Guard wants a\r\nrespite, he calls out--\r\n\r\n    Ane, twa, three, my Craw's no free.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Jamieson defines \"Badger-reeshil\" as a severe blow; borrowed, it\r\nis supposed, from the hunting of the badger, or from the old game of\r\n\"Beating the Badger.\"\r\n\r\n    Then but he ran wi' hasty breishell,\r\n    And laid on Hab a badger-reishill.\r\n\r\n--_MS.

(A. B. Gomme). Strutt describes a\r\nhandball game played during the Easter holidays for Tansy cakes\r\n(_Sports_, p. 94). Halliwell gives rhymes for ball divination (_Popular\r\nRhymes_, p. 298) to determine the number of years before marriage will\r\narrive. Miss Baker (_Northamptonshire Glossary_) says, \"The May garland\r\nis suspended by ropes from the school-house to an opposite tree, and the\r\nMayers amuse themselves by throwing balls over it. A native of\r\nFotheringay, Mr. C. W. Peach,\" says Miss Baker, \"has supplied me with\r\nthe reminiscences of his own youth. He says the May garland was hung in\r\nthe centre of the street, on a rope stretched from house to house. Then\r\nwas made the trial of skill in tossing balls (small white leather ones)\r\nthrough the framework of the garland, to effect which was a triumph.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Cuck Ball,\" \"Keppy Ball,\" \"Monday.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBall and Bonnets\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nThis is a boys' game. The players may be of any number. They place their\r\ncaps or bonnets in a row. One of the boys takes a ball, and from a fixed\r\npoint, at a few yards' distance from the bonnets, tries to throw it into\r\none of the caps (fig. 1). If the ball falls into the cap, all the boys,\r\nexcept the one into whose cap the ball has fallen, run off. The boy into\r\nwhose cap the ball has been thrown goes up to it, lifts the ball from\r\nit, and calls out \"Stop!\" The other boys stop. The boy with the ball\r\ntries to strike one of the other boys (fig. 2). If he does so, a small\r\nstone is put into the cap of the boy struck. If he misses, a stone is\r\nput into his own cap. If the boy who is to pitch the ball into the cap\r\nmisses, a stone is put into his own cap, and he makes another trial. The\r\ngame goes on till six stones are put into one cap. The boy in whose cap\r\nare the six stones has to place his hand against a wall, when he\r\nreceives a certain number of blows with the ball thrown with force by\r\none of the players. The blows go by the name of \"buns.\" The game may go\r\non in the same way till each player gets his \"buns.\"--Nairn (Rev. W.\r\nGregor).\r\n\r\nSee \"Hats in Holes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBall in the Decker\r\n\r\nA row of boys' caps is set by a wall. One boy throws a ball into one of\r\nthe caps. The owner of the cap runs away, and is chased by all the\r\nothers till caught. He then throws the ball.--Dublin (Mrs. Lincoln).\r\n\r\n\r\nBall of Primrose\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n    We'll wear yellow ribbons, yellow ribbons, yellow ribbons,\r\n    We'll wear yellow ribbons at the Ball of Primrose;\r\n    We'll all go a-waltzing, a-waltzing, a-waltzing,\r\n    We'll all go a-waltzing at the Ball of Primrose.\r\n\r\n--Epworth, Doncaster; and Lossiemouth, Yorkshire (Charles C.

The game is continued, different coloured\r\nribbons being named each time.\r\n\r\n(_c_) This game was played in 1869, so cannot have arisen from the\r\npolitical movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaloon\r\n\r\nA game played with an inflated ball of strong leather, the ball being\r\nstruck by the arm, which was defended by a bracer of wood.--Brand's\r\n_Pop. Antiq._, ii. 394.\r\n\r\n(_b_) It is spelt \"balloo\" in Ben Jonson, iii. 216, and \"baloome\" in\r\nRandolph's _Poems_, 1643, p. 105. It is also mentioned in Middleton's\r\n_Works_, iv. 342, and by Donne.\r\n\r\n    \"'Tis ten a clock and past; all whom the mues,\r\n    _Baloun_, tennis, diet, or the stews\r\n    Had all the morning held.\"\r\n\r\n--Donne's _Poems_, p. 133.\r\n\r\nToone (_Etymological Dict._) says it is a game rather for exercise than\r\ncontention; it was well known and practised in England in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, and is mentioned as one of the sports of Prince Henry, son of\r\nJames I., in 1610. Strutt (_Sports and Pastimes_, p. 96) gives two\r\nillustrations of what he considers to be baloon ball play, from\r\nfourteenth century MSS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBandy-ball\r\n\r\nA game played with sticks called \"bandies,\" bent and round at one end,\r\nand a small wooden ball, which each party endeavours to drive to\r\nopposite fixed points. Northbrooke in 1577 mentions it as a favourite\r\ngame in Devonshire (Halliwell's _Dict. of Provincialisms_). Strutt says\r\nthe bat-stick was called a \"bandy\" on account of its being bent, and\r\ngives a drawing from a fourteenth century MS. book of prayers belonging\r\nto Mr. Francis Douce (_Sports_, p. 102). The bats in this drawing are\r\nnearly identical with modern golf-sticks, and \"Golf\" seems to be derived\r\nfrom this game. Peacock mentions it in his _Glossary of Manley and\r\nCorringham Words_. Forby has an interesting note in his _Vocabulary of\r\nEast Anglia_, i. 14. He says, \"The bandy was made of very tough wood, or\r\nshod with metal, or with the point of the horn or the hoof of some\r\nanimal. The ball is a knob or gnarl from the trunk of a tree, carefully\r\nformed into a globular shape. The adverse parties strive to beat it with\r\ntheir bandies through one or other of the goals.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBandy Cad or Gad\r\n\r\nA game played with a nurr and crooked stick, also called \"Shinty,\" and\r\nmuch the same as the \"Hockey\" of the South of England. \"Cad\" is the same\r\nas \"cat\" in the game of \"Tip-cat;\" it simply means a cut piece of\r\nwood.--Nodal and Milner's _Lancashire Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBandy-hoshoe\r\n\r\nA game at ball common in Norfolk, and played in a similar manner to\r\n\"Bandy\" (Halliwell's _Dictionary_). Toone (_Etymological Dictionary_)\r\nsays it is also played in Suffolk, and in West Sussex is called \"Hawky.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBandy-wicket\r\n\r\nThe game of \"Cricket,\" played with a bandy instead of a bat (Halliwell's\r\n_Dictionary_). Toone mentions it as played in Norfolk (_Dict._), and\r\nMoor as played in Suffolk with bricks usually, or, in their absence,\r\nwith bats in place of bails or stumps (_Suffolk Words_).\r\n\r\n\r\nBanger\r\n\r\nEach boy provides himself with a button. One of the boys lays his button\r\non the ground, near a wall. The other boys snap their buttons in turn\r\nagainst the wall. If the button drops within one span or hand-reach of\r\nthe button laid down, it counts two (fig. 2); if within two spans, it\r\ncounts one. When it hits the button and bounces within one span, it\r\ncounts four (fig. 1); within two spans, three; and above three spans,\r\none. Each player snaps in turn for an agreed number; the first to score\r\nthis number wins the game.--Deptford, Kent, and generally in London\r\nstreets (Miss Chase).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nThis game is known in America as \"Spans.\"--Newell, p. 188.\r\n\r\n\r\nBar\r\n\r\nTo play at \"Bar,\" a species of game anciently used in\r\nScotland.--Jamieson.\r\n\r\nThis game had in ancient times in England been simply denominated\r\n\"Bars,\" or, as in an Act of James IV., 1491, edit. 1814, p. 227: \"That\r\nna induellare within burgh . . . play at bar,\" \"playing at Bars.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Prisoner's Base.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBarbarie, King of the\r\n\r\n    I.

Some of the soldiers go to the fortress and surround\r\nit, singing the first verse (fig. 2). The children in the fortress\r\nreply, the four first verses being thus sung alternately. The soldiers\r\nthen go to the King singing the fifth verse (fig. 3), the remaining\r\nverses being thus sung alternately. One of the soldiers then goes to the\r\nfortress and endeavours by throwing herself on the clasped hands of the\r\nchildren forming the fortress to break down the guard (fig. 4). All the\r\nsoldiers try to do this, one after the other; finally the King comes,\r\nwho breaks down the guard. The whole troop of soldiers then burst\r\nthrough the parted arms (fig. 5).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\nThis is the Deptford version. The Clapham version is almost identical;\r\nthe children take hold of each others' skirts and make a long line. If\r\nthe brave soldier is not able to break the clasped hands he goes to the\r\nend of the line of soldiers. The soldiers do not surround the fortress.\r\nIn the Suffolk version the soldiers try to break through the girls'\r\nhands. If they do they have the tower. The Cornwall version is not so\r\ncompletely an illustration of the capture of a fortress.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarley-break\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nBarley-break, or the Last Couple in Hell, was a game played by six\r\npeople, three of each sex, who were coupled by lot. A piece of ground\r\nwas then chosen, and divided into three compartments, of which the\r\nmiddle one was called Hell. It was the object of the couple condemned to\r\nthis division to catch the others who advanced from the two extremities\r\n(figs. 1, 2), in which case a change of situation took place, and Hell\r\nwas filled by the couple who were excluded by pre-occupation from the\r\nother place (fig. 3). In this catching, however, there was some\r\ndifficulty, as by the regulations of the game the middle couple were not\r\nto separate before they had succeeded, while the others might break\r\nhands whenever they found themselves hard pressed. When all had been\r\ntaken in turn, the last couple was said to be \"in Hell,\" and the game\r\nended.--Dekker's _Works_, iv. 434.\r\n\r\nJamieson calls this \"a game generally played by young people in a\r\ncorn-yard. Hence called _barla-bracks about the stacks_, S. B.\" (_i.\r\ne._, in the North of Scotland). \"One stack is fixed on as the _dule_ or\r\ngoal; and one person is appointed to catch the rest of the company, who\r\nrun out from the _dule_. He does not leave it till they are all out of\r\nsight. Then he sets off to catch them. Any one who is taken cannot run\r\nout again with his former associates, being accounted a prisoner; but is\r\nobliged to assist his captor in pursuing the rest. When all are taken\r\nthe game is finished; and he who was first taken is bound to act as\r\ncatcher in the next game. This innocent sport seems to be almost\r\nentirely forgotten in the South of Scotland. It is also falling into\r\ndesuetude in the North.\"\r\n\r\n(_b_) The following description of Barley-break, written by Sir Philip\r\nSidney, is taken from the song of Lamon, in the first volume of the\r\n_Arcadia_, where he relates the passion of Claius and Strephon for the\r\nbeautiful Urania:--\r\n\r\n                      She went abroad, thereby,\r\n    At _barley-brake_ her sweet, swift foot to try. . . .\r\n    Afield they go, where many lookers be.\r\n\r\n      Then couples three be straight allotted there,\r\n    They of both ends, the middle two, do fly;\r\n      The two that in mid-place Hell called were\r\n    Must strive, with waiting foot and watching eye,\r\n      To catch of them, and them to hell to bear,\r\n    That they, as well as they, may hell supply;\r\n      Like some that seek to salve their blotted name\r\n      Will others blot, till all do taste of shame.\r\n\r\n      There may you see, soon as the middle two\r\n    Do, coupled, towards either couple make,\r\n      They, false and fearful, do their hands undo;\r\n    Brother his brother, friend doth friend forsake,\r\n      Heeding himself, cares not how fellow do,\r\n    But of a stranger mutual help doth take;\r\n      As perjured cowards in adversity,\r\n      With sight of fear, from friends to friends do fly.\r\n\r\nSir John Suckling also has given a description of this pastime with\r\nallegorical personages, which is quoted by Brand. In Holiday's play of\r\nthe _Marriages of the Arts_, 1618, this sport is introduced, and also by\r\nHerrick (_Hesperides_, p. 44). Barley-break is several times alluded to\r\nin Massinger's plays: see the _Dramatic Works of Philip Massinger_,\r\n1779, i. 167. \"We'll run at barley-break first, and you shall be in\r\nhell\" (Dekker's _The Honest Whore_). \"Hee's at barli-break, and the last\r\ncouple are now in hell\" (Dekker's _The Virgin Martir_). See Gifford's\r\n_Massinger_, i. 104, edit. 1813. See also Browne's _Britannia's\r\nPastorals_, published in 1614, Book I., Song 3, p. 76.\r\n\r\nRandle Holme mentions this game as prevailing in his day in Lancashire.\r\nHarland and Wilkinson believe this game to have left its traces in\r\nYorkshire and Lancashire. A couple link hands and sally forth from\r\n_home_, shouting something like\r\n\r\n    Aggery, ag, ag,\r\n    Ag's gi'en warning,\r\n\r\nand trying to tick or touch with the free hand any of the boys running\r\nabout separately. These latter try to slip behind the couple and throw\r\ntheir weight on the joined hands to separate them without being first\r\ntouched or ticked; and if they sunder the couple, each of the severed\r\nones has to carry one home on his back. Whoever is touched takes the\r\nplace of the toucher in the linked couple (_Legends of Lancashire_, p.\r\n138). The modern name of this game is \"Prison Bars\" (_Ibid._, p. 141).\r\nThere is also a description of the game in a little tract called _Barley\r\nBreake; or, A Warning for Wantons_, 1607. It is mentioned in Wilbraham's\r\n_Cheshire Glossary_ as \"an old Cheshire game.\" Barnes, in his\r\n_Dorsetshire Glossary_, says he has seen it played with one catcher on\r\nhands and knees in the small ring (Hell), and the others dancing round\r\nthe ring crying \"Burn the wold witch, you barley breech.\" Holland\r\n(_Cheshire Glossary_) also mentions it as an old Cheshire game.\r\n\r\nSee \"Boggle about the Stacks,\" \"Scots and English.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBarnes (Mr.)\r\n\r\n    Mr. Barnes is dead and gone,\r\n    And left his widder,\r\n    Three poor children in her arms;\r\n    What will you give her?\r\n\r\n    Where did you come from?\r\n\r\n--Played about 1850 at Hurstmonceux, Sussex (Miss Chase).\r\n\r\nThis is probably a forfeit game, imperfectly remembered. See \"Old\r\nSoldier.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBase-ball\r\n\r\nAn undescribed Suffolk game.--Moor's _Suffolk Words_. See \"Rounders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBasket\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--London (A. B. Gomme).\r\n\r\nIn this game the children all follow one who is styled the \"mother,\"\r\nsinging:\r\n\r\n    I'll follow my mother to market,\r\n    To buy a silver basket.\r\n\r\nThe mother presently turns and catches or pretends to beat\r\nthem.--Dorsetshire (_Folk-lore Journal_, vii. 231).\r\n\r\n    We'll follow our mother to market,\r\n    To buy herself a basket;\r\n    When she comes home she'll break our bones,\r\n    We'll follow our mother to market.\r\n\r\n--Hersham, Surrey (_Folk-lore Record_, v. 84).\r\n\r\nA version familiar to me is the same as above, but ending with\r\n\r\n    For tumbling over cherry stones.\r\n\r\nThe mother then chased and beat those children she caught. The idea was,\r\nI believe, that the children were imitating or mocking their mother (A.\r\nB. G.). In Warwickshire the four lines of the Surrey game are concluded\r\nby the additional lines--\r\n\r\n    We don't care whether we work or no,\r\n    We'll follow our mother on tipty-toe.\r\n\r\nWhen the mother runs after them and buffets them.--Northall's _English\r\nFolk Rhymes_, p. 393.\r\n\r\n\r\nBattledore and Shuttlecock\r\n\r\nSee \"Shuttlefeather.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBedlams or Relievo\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nA number of boys agree to play at this game, and sides are picked. Five,\r\nfor example, play on each side. A square is chalked out on a footpath by\r\nthe side of a road, which is called the \"Den;\" five of the boys remain\r\nby the side of the Den, one of whom is called the \"Tenter;\" the Tenter\r\nhas charge of the Den, and he must always stand with one foot in the Den\r\nand the other upon the road; the remaining five boys go out to field, it\r\nbeing agreed beforehand that they shall only be allowed to run within a\r\nprescribed area, or in certain roads or streets (fig. 1). As soon as the\r\nboys who have gone out to field have reached a certain distance--there\r\nis no limit prescribed--they shout \"Relievo,\" and upon this signal the\r\nfour boys standing by the side of the Den pursue them, leaving the\r\nTenter in charge of the Den (fig. 2). When a boy is caught he is taken\r\nto the Den, where he is obliged to remain, unless the Tenter puts both\r\nhis feet into the Den, or takes out the one foot which he ought always\r\nto keep in the Den. If the Tenter is thus caught tripping, the prisoner\r\ncan escape from the Den. If during the progress of the game one of the\r\nboys out at field runs through the Den shouting \"Relievo\" without being\r\ncaught by the Tenter, the prisoner is allowed to escape, and join his\r\ncomrades at field. If one of the boys out at field is tired, and comes\r\nto stand by the side of the Den, he is not allowed to put his foot into\r\nthe Den. If he does so the prisoner calls out, \"There are two Tenters,\"\r\nand escapes if he can (fig. 3). When all the boys out at field have been\r\ncaught and put into the Den, the process is reversed--the boys who have\r\nbeen, as it were, hunted, taking the place of the hunters. Sometimes the\r\ncry is \"Delievo,\" and not \"Relievo.\" One or two variations occur in the\r\nplaying of this game. Sometimes the Tenter, instead of standing with one\r\nfoot in the Den, stands as far off the prisoner as the prisoner can\r\nspit. The choosing of sides is done by tossing. Two boys are selected to\r\ntoss. One of them throws up his cap, crying, \"Pot!\" or \"Lid!\" which is\r\nequivalent to \"Heads and Tails.\" If, when a prisoner is caught, he cries\r\nout \"Kings!\" or \"Kings to rest!\" he is allowed to escape. The game is a\r\nvery rough one.--Addy's _Sheffield Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeds\r\n\r\nJamieson gives this as the Scottish name for \"Hopscotch;\" also Brockett,\r\n_North Country Words_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBell-horses\r\n\r\n    I.

The\r\nrest of the children stand round in a circle, with the Miller in the\r\ncentre. All dance round and sing the verses. When it comes to the\r\nspelling part of the rhyme, the Miller points at one child, who must\r\ncall out the right letter. If the child fails to do this she becomes\r\nMiller. In the Shropshire version, a ring is formed with one player in\r\nthe middle. They dance round and sing the verses. When it comes to the\r\nspelling part, the girl in the middle cries B, and signals to another,\r\nwho says I, the next to her N, the third G, the fourth \"O! his name was\r\nBobby Bingo!\" Whoever makes a mistake takes the place of the girl in the\r\nmiddle. In the Liphook version, at the fourth line the children stand\r\nstill and repeat a letter each in turn as quickly as they can, clapping\r\ntheir hands, and at the last line they turn right round, join hands, and\r\nbegin again. In the Tean version, the one in the centre points, standing\r\nstill, to some in the ring to say the letters B.I.N.G; the letter O has\r\nto be sung; if not, the one who says it goes in the ring, and repeats it\r\nall again until the game is given up. In the other Staffordshire\r\nversion, when they stop, the one in the middle points to five of the\r\nothers in turn, who have to say the letters forming \"Bingo,\" while the\r\none to whom O comes has to sing it on the note on which the others left\r\noff. Any one who says the wrong letter, or fails to sing the O right,\r\ntakes the place of the middle one. The Northants version follows the\r\nLancashire version, but if the answers are all made correctly, the last\r\nline is sung by the circle, and the game begins again. In the\r\nMetheringham version the child in the centre is blindfolded. When the\r\nsong is over the girls say, \"Point with your finger as we go round.\" The\r\ngirl in the centre points accordingly, and whichever of the others\r\nhappens to be opposite to her when she says \"Stop!\" is caught. If the\r\nblindfolded girl can identify her captive they exchange places, and the\r\ngame goes on as before. The Forest of Dean and the Earls Heaton versions\r\nare played the same as the Lancashire. In the West Cornwall version, as\r\nseen played in 1884, a ring is formed, into the middle of which goes a\r\nchild holding a stick; the others with joined hands run round in a\r\ncircle, singing the verses. When they have finished singing they cease\r\nrunning, whilst the one in the centre, pointing with his stick, asks\r\nthem in turn to spell Bingo. If they all spell it correctly they again\r\nmove round singing; but should either of them make a mistake, he or she\r\nhas to take the place of the middle man (_Folk-lore Journal_, v. 58). In\r\nthe Hexham version they sing a second verse, which is the same as the\r\nfirst with the name spelt _backwards_. The Berks version is practically\r\nthe same as the Tean version. The Eckington (Derbyshire) version is\r\nplayed as follows:--A number of young women form a ring. A man stands\r\nwithin the ring, and they sing the words. He then makes choice of a\r\ngirl, who takes his arm. They both walk round the circle while the\r\nothers sing the same lines again. The girl who has been chosen makes\r\nchoice of a young man in the ring, who in his turn chooses another girl,\r\nand so on till they have all paired off.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The first verse of the Shropshire version is also sung at\r\nMetheringham, near Lincoln (C. C. Bell), and Cowes, I. W. (Miss E.\r\nSmith). The Staffordshire version of the words is sung in Forest of\r\nDean, Gloucestershire (Miss Matthews), West Cornwall (_Folk-lore\r\nJournal_, v. 58), Earls Heaton, Yorkshire (H. Hardy), Hexham,\r\nNorthumberland (Miss Barker), Leicester (Miss Ellis). Miss Peacock\r\nsays, \"A version is known in Lincolnshire.\" Tunes have also been sent\r\nfrom Tean, North Staffs. (Miss Keary), and Epworth, Doncaster (Mr. C. C.\r\nBell), which are nearly identical with the Leicester tune; from Market\r\nDrayton (Miss Burne), similar to the Derbyshire tune; from Monton,\r\nLancashire (Miss Dendy), which appears to be only the latter part of the\r\ntune, and is similar to those given above. The tune given by Rimbault is\r\nnot the same as those collected above, though there is a certain\r\nsimilarity.\r\n\r\nThe editor of _Northamptonshire Notes and Queries_, vol. i. p. 214,\r\nsays, \"Some readers will remember that Byngo is the name of the\r\n'Franklyn's dogge' that Ingoldsby introduces into a few lines described\r\nas a portion of a primitive ballad, which has escaped the researches of\r\nRitson and Ellis, but is yet replete with beauties of no common order.\"\r\nIn the _Nursery Songs_ collected by Ed. Rimbault from oral tradition is\r\n\"Little Bingo.\" The words of this are very similar to the Lancashire\r\nversion of the game sent by Miss Dendy. There is an additional verse in\r\nthe nursery song.\r\n\r\n\r\nBird-apprentice\r\n\r\nA row of boys or girls stands parallel with another row opposite. Each\r\nof the first row chooses the name of some bird, and a member of the\r\nother row then calls out all the names of birds he can think of. If the\r\nmiddle member of the first row has chosen either of them, he calls out\r\n\"Yes,\" and all the guessers immediately run to take the place of the\r\nfirst row, the members of which attempt to catch them. If any\r\nsucceed, they have the privilege of riding in on their captives'\r\nbacks.--Ogbourne, Wilts (H. S. May).\r\n\r\n\r\nBirds, Beasts, and Fishes\r\n\r\n  B × × × × × × × h = Bullfinch\r\n\r\n  E × × × × × × t   = Elephant\r\n\r\n  S × × × × × × × h = Swordfish\r\n\r\nThis is a slate game, and two or more children play. One writes the\r\ninitial and final letters of a bird's, beast's, or fish's name, making\r\ncrosses (×) instead of the intermediate letters of the word, stating\r\nwhether the name is that of bird, beast, or fish. The other players must\r\nguess in turn what the name is. The first one who succeeds takes for\r\nhimself the same number of marks as there are crosses in the word, and\r\nthen writes the name of anything he chooses in the same manner. If the\r\nplayers are unsuccessful in guessing the name, the writer takes the\r\nnumber to his own score and writes another. The game is won when one\r\nplayer gains a certain number of marks previously decided upon as\r\n\"game.\"--Barnes (A. B. Gomme).\r\n\r\n\r\nBittle-battle\r\n\r\nThe Sussex game of \"Stoolball.\" There is a tradition that this game was\r\noriginally played by the milkmaids with their milking-stools, which they\r\nused for bats; but this word makes it more probable that the stool was\r\nthe wicket, and that it was defended with the bittle, which would be\r\ncalled the bittle-bat.--Parish's _Sussex Dialect_.\r\n\r\nSee \"Stoolball.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBitty-base\r\n\r\nBishop Kennet (in _MS.

The first set sing the first line, the others\r\nreplying with the second line, and so with the third and fourth lines.\r\nThe two sides then rush over to each other, and the second set are\r\ncaught. The child who is caught last becomes one of the first set for\r\nanother game. This is the Earls Heaton version. The Lancashire game, as\r\ndescribed by Miss Dendy, is: One child stands opposite a row of\r\nchildren, and the row run over to the opposite side, when the one child\r\ntries to catch them. The prisoners made, join the one child, and assist\r\nher in the process of catching the others. The rhyme is repeated in each\r\ncase until all are caught, the last one out becoming \"Blackthorn\" for a\r\nnew game. Harland and Wilkinson describe the game somewhat differently.\r\nEach player has a mark, and after the dialogue the players run over to\r\neach other's marks, and if any can be caught before getting home to the\r\nopposite mark, he has to carry his captor to the mark, when he takes his\r\nplace as an additional catcher.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Miss Burne's version (_Shropshire Folk-lore_, p. 521) is\r\npractically the same as the Earls Heaton game, and Easther in his\r\n_Almondbury Glossary_ gives a version practically like the Sheffield.\r\nMr. Hardy says it is sometimes called \"Black-butt,\" when the opposite\r\nside cry \"Away we cut.\" Miss Dendy quotes an old Lancashire rhyme, which\r\ncuriously refers to the different subjects in the Lancashire game rhyme.\r\nIt is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Little boy, little boy, where were you born?\r\n    Way up in Lancashire, under a thorn,\r\n    Where they sup butter-milk in a ram's horn.\r\n\r\nAnother version is given in _Notes and Queries_, 3rd Series, vii. 285.\r\n\r\n(_d_) This is a dramatic game, in which the children seem to personate\r\nanimals, and to depict events belonging to the history of the flock.\r\nMiss Burne groups it under her \"dramatic games.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBlind Bell\r\n\r\nA game formerly common in Berwickshire, in which all the players were\r\nhoodwinked except the person who was called the Bell. He carried a bell,\r\nwhich he rung, still endeavouring to keep out of the way of his\r\nhoodwinked partners in the game. When he was taken, the person who\r\nseized him was released from the bandage, and got possession of the\r\nbell, the bandage being transferred to him who was laid hold\r\nof.--Jamieson.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In \"The Modern Playmate,\" edited by Rev. J. G. Wood, this game is\r\ndescribed under the name of \"Jingling.\" Mr. Wood says there is a rougher\r\ngame played at country feasts and fairs in which a pig takes the place\r\nof the boy with the bell, but he does not give the locality (p. 7).\r\nStrutt also describes it (_Sports_, p. 317).\r\n\r\n\r\nBlind Bucky-Davy\r\n\r\nIn Somersetshire the game of \"Blind Man's Buff.\" Also in Cornwall (see\r\nCouch's _Polperro_, p. 173).

The one\r\nwho blindfolds ascertains that the player cannot see by putting the\r\nfirst question. When the players are satisfied that the blindfolding is\r\ncomplete, the dialogue follows, and the blind man is turned round three\r\ntimes. The game is for him to catch one of the players, who is\r\nblindfolded in turn if the blind man succeeds in guessing who he is.\r\nPlayers are allowed to pull, pinch, and buffet the blind man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n(_c_) This sport is found among the illuminations of an old missal\r\nformerly in the possession of John Ives, cited by Strutt in his _Manners\r\nand Customs_.

Gay says\r\nconcerning it--\r\n\r\n    As once I play'd at _blindman's-buff_, it hap't,\r\n    _About my eyes the towel thick was wrapt._\r\n    _I miss'd the swains, and seiz'd on Blouzelind._\r\n\r\nAnd another reference is quoted by Brand (ii. 398)--\r\n\r\n    Sometyme the one would goe, sometyme the other,\r\n    Sometymes all thre at once, and sometyme neither;\r\n    Thus they with him play at boyes blynde-man-bluffe.\r\n\r\n--_The Newe Metamorphosis_, 1600, MS.\r\n\r\nOther names for this game are \"Belly Mantie,\" \"Billy Blind,\"\r\n\"Blind Bucky Davy,\" \"Blind Harie,\" \"Blind Hob,\" \"Blind Nerry Mopsey,\"\r\n\"Blind Palmie,\" \"Blind Sim,\" \"Buck Hid,\" \"Chacke Blynd Man,\"\r\n\"Hoodle-cum-blind,\" \"Hoodman Blind,\" \"Hooper's Hide,\" \"Jockie Blind\r\nMan.\"\r\n\r\n(_d_) There is some reason for believing that this game can be traced up\r\nto very ancient rites connected with prehistoric worship. The name\r\n\"Billy Blind\" denoted the person who was blindfolded in the game, as may\r\nbe seen by an old poem by Lyndsay, quoted by Jamieson:\r\n\r\n    War I ane King\r\n    I sould richt sone mak reformatioun\r\n    Farlyeand thairof your grace sould richt sone finde\r\n    That Preistis sall leid yow lyke are bellye blinde.\r\n\r\nAnd also in Clerk's _Advice to Luvaris_:\r\n\r\n    Sum festnit is and ma not flé,\r\n    Sum led is lyk the belly blynd\r\n    With luve, war bettir lat it be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"It is probable,\" says Jamieson, \"that the term is the same as Billy\r\nBlynde, said to be the name of a familiar spirit or good genius somewhat\r\nsimilar to the brownie.\" Professor Child identifies it with Odin, the\r\nblind deity. Another name in Scotland is also \"Blind Harie,\" which is\r\nnot the common Christian name \"Harry,\" because this was not a name\r\nfamiliar in Scotland. Blind Harie may therefore, Jamieson thinks, arise\r\nfrom the rough or hairy attire worn by the principal actor. Auld Harie\r\nis one of the names given to the devil, and also to the spirit Brownie,\r\nwho is represented as a hairy being. Under \"Coolin,\" a curious Highland\r\ncustom is described by Jamieson, which is singularly like the game of\r\n\"Belly Blind,\" and assists in the conclusion that the game has\r\ndescended from a rite where animal gods were represented. Sporting with\r\nanimals before sacrificing them was a general feature at these rites. It\r\nis known that the Church opposed the people imitating beasts, and in\r\nthis connection it is curious to note that in South Germany the game is\r\ncalled _blind bock_, i. e., \"blind goat,\" and in German _blinde kuhe_,\r\nor \"blind cow.\" In Scotland, one of the names for the game, according to\r\nA. Scott's poems, was \"Blind Buk\":\r\n\r\n    Blind buk! but at the bound thou schutes,\r\n    And them forbeirs that the rebutes.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be conjectured that the person who was hoodwinked\r\nassumed the appearance of a goat, stag, or cow by putting on the skin of\r\none of those animals.\r\n\r\nHe who is twice crowned or touched on the head by the taker or him who\r\nis hoodwinked, instead of once only, according to the law of the game,\r\nis said to be _brunt_ (burned), and regains his liberty.--Jamieson.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlind Man's Stan\r\n\r\nA boys' game, played with the eggs of small birds. The eggs are placed\r\non the ground, and the player who is blindfolded takes a certain number\r\nof steps in the direction of the eggs; he then slaps the ground with a\r\nstick thrice in the hope of breaking the eggs; then the next player, and\r\nso on.--Patterson's _Antrim and Down Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlind Nerry-Mopsey\r\n\r\nThe Whitby name for \"Blind Man's Buff.\"--Robinson's _Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlind Palmie or Pawmie\r\n\r\nOne of the names given to the game of \"Blindman's Buff.\"--Jamieson.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlind Sim\r\n\r\nSuffolk name for \"Blind Man's Buff.\"--Forby's _Vocabulary of East\r\nAnglia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlock, Haimmer (Hammer), and Nail\r\n\r\nThis is a boys' game, and requires seven players. One boy, the Block,\r\ngoes down on all fours; another, the Nail, does the same behind the\r\nBlock, with his head close to his _a posteriori_ part. A third boy, the\r\nHammer, lies down on his back behind the two. Of the remaining four boys\r\none stations himself at each leg and one at each arm of the Hammer, and\r\nhe is thus lifted. He is swung backwards and forwards three times in\r\nthis position by the four, who keep repeating \"Once, twice, thrice.\"\r\nWhen the word \"Thrice\" is repeated, the _a posteriori_ part of the\r\nHammer is knocked against the same part of the Nail. Any number of\r\nknocks may be given, according to the humour of the players.--Keith\r\n(Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\nA fellow lies on all fours--this is the Block; one steadies him\r\nbefore--this is the Study; a third is made a Hammer of, and swung by\r\nboys against the Block (Mactaggart's _Gallovidian Encyclopædia_).\r\nPatterson (_Antrim and Down Glossary_) mentions a game, \"Hammer, Block,\r\nand Bible,\" which is probably the same game.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlow-point\r\n\r\nStrutt considers this to have been a children's game, played by blowing\r\nan arrow through a trunk at certain numbers by way of lottery (_Sports_,\r\np. 403). Nares says the game was blowing small pins or points against\r\neach other, and probably not unlike \"Push-pin.\" Marmion in his\r\n_Antiquary_, 1641, says: \"I have heard of a nobleman that has been drunk\r\nwith a tinker, and of a magnifico that has played at blow-point.\" In the\r\n_Comedy of Lingua_, 1607, act iii., sc. 2, Anamnestes introduces Memory\r\nas telling \"how he played at blowe-point with Jupiter when he was in his\r\nside-coats.\" References to this game are also made in _Apollo Shroving_,\r\n1627, p. 49; and see Hawkins' _English Drama_, iii. 243.\r\n\r\nSee \"Dust-Point.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBob Cherry\r\n\r\nA children's game, consisting in jumping at cherries above their heads\r\nand trying to catch them with their mouths (Halliwell's _Dictionary_).\r\nIt is alluded to in Herrick's _Hesperides_ as \"Chop Cherry.\" Major\r\nLowsley describes the game as taking the end of a cherry-stalk between\r\nthe teeth, and holding the head perfectly level, trying to get the\r\ncherry into the mouth without using the hands or moving the head\r\n(_Berkshire Glossary_). It is also mentioned in Peacock's _Manley and\r\nCorringham Glossary_. Strutt gives a curious illustration of the game in\r\nhis _Sports and Pastimes_, which is here reproduced from the original\r\nMS. in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Staffordshire St. Clement Day custom (Poole's _Staffordshire\r\nCustoms, &c._, p. 36) and the northern Hallowe'en custom (Brockett's\r\n_North-Country Words_) probably indicate the origin of this game from an\r\nancient rite.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoggle about the Stacks\r\n\r\nA favourite play among young people in the villages, in which one hunts\r\nseveral others (Brockett's _North-Country Words_). The game is alluded\r\nto in one of the songs given by Ritson (ii. 3), and Jamieson describes\r\nit as a Scottish game.\r\n\r\nSee \"Barley-break.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBoggle-bush\r\n\r\nThe child's play of finding the hidden person in the\r\ncompany.--Robinson's _Whitby Glossary_. See \"Hide and Seek.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBonnety\r\n\r\nThis is a boys' game. The players place their bonnets or caps in a pile.\r\nThey then join hands and stand in a circle round it. They then pull each\r\nother, and twist and wriggle round and round and over it, till one\r\noverturns it or knocks a bonnet off it. The player who does so is\r\nhoisted on the back of another, and pelted by all the others with their\r\nbonnets.--Keith, Nairn (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\n\r\nBooman\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Norfolk.\r\n\r\n    Dill doule for Booman, Booman is dead and gone,\r\n    Left his wife all alone, and all his children.\r\n\r\n    Where shall we bury him? Carry him to London;\r\n    By his grandfather's grave grows a green onion.\r\n\r\n    Dig his grave wide and deep, strow it with flowers;\r\n    Toll the bell, toll the bell, twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n--Norfolk, 1825-30 (J. Doe).\r\n\r\n(_b_) One boy lies down and personates Booman. Other boys form a ring\r\nround him, joining hands and alternately raising and lowering them, to\r\nimitate bell-pulling, while the girls who play sit down and weep. The\r\nboys sing the first verse. The girls seek for daisies or any wild\r\nflowers, and join in the singing of the second verse, while the boys\r\nraise the prostrate Booman and carry him about. When singing the third\r\nverse the boys act digging a grave, and the dead boy is lowered. The\r\ngirls strew flowers over the body. When finished another boy becomes\r\nBooman.\r\n\r\n(_c_) This game is clearly dramatic, to imitate a funeral. Mr. Doe\r\nwrites, \"I have seen somewhere [in Norfolk] a tomb with a crest on it--a\r\nleek--and the name Beaumont,\" but it does not seem necessary to thus\r\naccount for the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoss-out\r\n\r\nA game at marbles. Strutt describes it as follows:--\"One bowls a marble\r\nto any distance that he pleases, which serves as a mark for his\r\nantagonist to bowl at, whose business it is to hit the marble first\r\nbowled, or lay his own near enough to it for him to span the space\r\nbetween them and touch both the marbles. In either case he wins. If not,\r\nhis marble remains where it lay, and becomes a mark for the first\r\nplayer, and so alternately until the game be won.\"--_Sports_, p. 384.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoss and Span\r\n\r\nThe same as \"Boss-out.\" It is mentioned, but not described, in Baker's\r\n_Northamptonshire Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoys and Girls\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--_The Dancing Master_, 1728, vol. ii., p. 138.\r\n\r\n    Boys, boys, come out to play,\r\n    The moon doth shine as bright as day;\r\n    Come with a whoop, come with a call,\r\n    Come with a goodwill or don't come at all;\r\n    Lose your supper and lose your sleep,\r\n    So come to your playmates in the street.\r\n\r\n--_Useful Transactions in Philosophy_, p. 44.\r\n\r\nThis rhyme is repeated when it is decided to begin any game, as a\r\ngeneral call to the players. The above writer says it occurs in a very\r\nancient MS., but does not give any reference to it. Halliwell quotes the\r\nfour first lines, the first line reading \"Boys and girls,\" instead of\r\n\"Boys, boys,\" from a curious ballad written about the year 1720,\r\nformerly in the possession of Mr. Crofton Croker (_Nursery Rhymes_).\r\nChambers also gives this rhyme (_Popular Rhymes_, p. 152).\r\n\r\n\r\nBranks\r\n\r\nA game formerly common at fairs, called also \"Hit my Legs and miss my\r\nPegs.\"--Dickinson's _Cumberland Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBridgeboard\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA game at marbles. The boys have a board a foot long, four inches in\r\ndepth, and an inch (or so) thick, with squares as in the diagram; any\r\nnumber of holes at the ground edge, numbered irregularly. The board is\r\nplaced firmly on the ground, and each player bowls at it. He wins the\r\nnumber of marbles denoted by the figure above the opening through which\r\nhis marble passes. If he misses a hole, his marble is lost to the owner\r\nof the Bridgeboard.--Earls Heaton (Herbert Hardy).

Two children act in concert, it being understood that the\r\nlast person speaking when Ebenezer goes out of the room is the person to\r\nbe chosen. The medium left in the room causes the others to think of\r\nthis person without letting them know that they are not choosing of\r\ntheir own free will. The medium then says, \"Brother Ebenezer, come in,\"\r\nand asks him in succession, \"Was it William, or Jane,\" &c., mentioning\r\nseveral names before saying the right one, Ebenezer saying \"No!\" to all\r\nuntil the one is mentioned who last spoke.--Bitterne, Hants (Mrs.\r\nByford).\r\n\r\n\r\nBubble-hole\r\n\r\nA child's game, undescribed.--Halliwell's _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBubble-justice\r\n\r\nThe name of a game probably the same as \"Nine Holes.\"--Halliwell's\r\n_Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuck, Buck\r\n\r\nA boy stoops so that his arms rest on a table; another boy sits on him\r\nas he would on a horse. He then holds up (say) three fingers, and says--\r\n\r\n    Buck, buck, how many horns do I hold up?\r\n\r\nThe stooping boy guesses, and if he says a wrong number the other says--\r\n\r\n    [Two] you say and three there be;\r\n    Buck, buck, how many horns do I hold up?\r\n\r\nWhen the stooping boy guesses rightly the other says--\r\n\r\n    [Four] you say and [four] there be;\r\n    Buck, buck, rise up.\r\n\r\nThe boy then gets off and stoops for the other one to mount, and the\r\ngame is played again.--London (J. P. Emslie).\r\n\r\nSimilar action accompanies the following rhyme:--\r\n\r\n    Inkum, jinkum, Jeremy buck,\r\n    Yamdy horns do au cock up?\r\n    Two thà sès, and three there is,\r\n    Au'll lea'n thee to la'ke at Inkum.\r\n\r\n--Almondbury (Easther's _Glossary_).\r\n\r\nA different action occurs in other places. It is played by three boys in\r\nthe following way:--One stands with his back to a wall; the second\r\nstoops down with his head against the stomach of the first boy, \"forming\r\na back;\" the third jumps on it, and holds up his hand with the fingers\r\ndistended, saying--\r\n\r\n    Buck shee, buck shee buck,\r\n    How many fingers do I hold up?\r\n\r\nShould the stooper guess correctly, they all change places, and the\r\njumper forms the back. Another and not such a rough way of playing this\r\ngame is for the guesser to stand with his face towards a wall, keeping\r\nhis eyes shut.--Cornwall (_Folk-lore Journal_, v. 59).\r\n\r\nIn Nairn, Scotland, the game is called Post and Rider. One boy, the\r\nPost, takes his stand beside a wall. Another boy stoops down with his\r\nhead touching the Post's breast. Several other boys stoop down in the\r\nsame way behind the first boy, all in line. The Rider then leaps on the\r\nback of the boy at the end of the row of stooping boys, and from his\r\nback to that of the one in front, and so on from back to back till he\r\nreaches the boy next the Post. He then holds up so many fingers, and\r\nsays--\r\n\r\n    Buck, buck, how many fingers do I hold up?\r\n\r\nThe boy makes a guess. If the number guessed is wrong, the Rider gives\r\nthe number guessed as well as the correct number, and again holds up so\r\nmany, saying--\r\n\r\n    [Four] you say, but [two] it is;\r\n    Buck, buck, how many fingers do I hold up?\r\n\r\nThis goes on till the correct number is guessed, when the guesser\r\nbecomes the Rider. The game was called \"Buck, Buck\" at Keith. Three\r\nplayers only took part in the game--the Post, the Buck, and the Rider.\r\nThe words used by the Rider were--\r\n\r\n    Buck, buck, how many horns do I hold up?\r\n\r\nIf the guess was wrong, the Rider gave the Buck as many blows or kicks\r\nwith the heel as the difference between the correct number and the\r\nnumber guessed. This process went on till the correct number was\r\nguessed, when the Rider and the Buck changed places.--Rev. W. Gregor.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Dr. Tylor says: \"It is interesting to notice the wide distribution\r\nand long permanence of these trifles in history when we read the\r\nfollowing passage from Petronius Arbiter, written in the time of\r\nNero:--'Trimalchio, not to seem moved by the loss, kissed the boy, and\r\nbade him get up on his back. Without delay the boy climbed on horseback\r\non him, and slapped him on the shoulders with his hand, laughing and\r\ncalling out, \"Bucca, bucca, quot sunt hic?\"'--_Petron.

Hall\r\nmentions this game, temp. Henry VIII., f. 91.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuckey-how\r\n\r\nFor this the boys divide into sides. One \"stops at home,\" the other goes\r\noff to a certain distance agreed on beforehand and shouts \"Buckey-how.\"\r\nThe boys \"at home\" then give chase, and when they succeed in catching an\r\nadversary, they bring him home, and there he stays until all on his side\r\nare caught, when they in turn become the chasers.--Cornwall (_Folk-lore\r\nJournal_, v. 60).\r\n\r\n\r\nBuff\r\n\r\n    1st player, thumping the floor with a stick: \"Knock, knock!\"\r\n    2nd ditto: \"Who's there?\"\r\n    1st: \"Buff.\"\r\n    2nd: \"What says Buff?\"\r\n    1st: \"Buff says Buff to all his men,\r\n         And I say Buff to you again!\"\r\n    2nd: \"Methinks Buff smiles?\"\r\n    1st: \"Buff neither laughs nor smiles,\r\n         But looks in your face\r\n         With a comical grace,\r\n         And delivers the staff to you again\" (handing it over).\r\n\r\n--Shropshire (Burne's _Shropshire Folk-lore_, p. 526).\r\n\r\nSame verses as in Shropshire, except the last, which runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Buff neither laughs nor smiles,\r\n    But strokes his face\r\n    With a very good grace,\r\n    And delivers his staff to you.\r\n\r\n--Cheltenham (Miss E. Mendham).\r\n\r\nSame verses as in Shropshire, except the last, which runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Buff neither laughs nor smiles,\r\n    But strokes his face for want of grace,\r\n    And sticks his staff in the right place.\r\n\r\n--London (J. P. Emslie).\r\n\r\n(_b_) Five or six children stand in a row. Another child comes up to the\r\nfirst of the row, and strikes smartly on the ground with a stick. The\r\nchild facing him asks the first question, and the one with the stick\r\nanswers. At \"strokes his face\" he suits the action to the words, and\r\nthen thumps with his stick on the ground at the beginning of the last\r\nline. The object of all the players is to make Buff smile while going\r\nthrough this absurdity, and if he does he must pay a forfeit.\r\n\r\nAnother version is for one child to be blindfolded, and stand in the\r\nmiddle of a ring of children, holding a long wand in his hand. The ring\r\ndance round to a tune and sing a chorus [which is not given by the\r\nwriter]. They then stop. Buff extends his wand, and the person to whom\r\nit happens to be pointed must step out of the circle to hold the end in\r\nhis hand. Buff then interrogates the holder of the wand by grunting\r\nthree times, and is answered in like manner. Buff then guesses who is\r\nthe holder of the wand. If he guesses rightly, the holder of the stick\r\nbecomes Buff, and he joins the ring (_Winter Evening's Amusements_, p.\r\n6). When I played at this game the ring of children walked in silence\r\nthree times only round Buff, then stopped and knelt or stooped down on\r\nthe ground, strict silence being observed. Buff asked three questions\r\n(anything he chose) of the child to whom he pointed the stick, who\r\nreplied by imitating cries of animals or birds (A. B. Gomme).\r\n\r\n(_c_) This is a well-known game. It is also called \"Buffy Gruffy,\" or\r\n\"Indian Buff.\" The Dorsetshire version in _Folk-lore Journal_, vii. 238,\r\n239, is the same as the Shropshire version. Halliwell (_Nursery\r\nRhymes_, cclxxxii.) gives a slight variant. It is also given by Mr. Addy\r\nin his _Sheffield Glossary_, the words being the same except the last\r\ntwo lines, which run--\r\n\r\n    But shows his face with a comely grace,\r\n    And leaves his staff at the very next place.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuk-hid\r\n\r\nThis seems to be an old name for some game, probably \"Blindman's Buff,\"\r\nSw. \"Blind-bock,\" q. \"bock\" and \"hufwud head\" (having the head\r\nresembling a goat). The sense, however, would agree better with\r\n\"Bo-peep\" or \"Hide and Seek.\"--Jamieson.\r\n\r\n\r\nBull in the Park\r\n\r\nOne child places himself in the centre of a circle of others. He then\r\nasks each of the circle in turn, \"Where's the key of the park?\" and is\r\nanswered by every one, except the last, \"Ask the next-door neighbour.\"\r\nThe last one answers, \"Get out the way you came in.\" The centre one then\r\nmakes a dash at the hands of some of the circle, and continues to do so\r\nuntil he breaks through, when all the others chase him. Whoever catches\r\nhim is then Bull.--Liphook, Hants (Miss Fowler).\r\n\r\n\"The Bull in the Barn\" is apparently the same game. The players form a\r\nring; one player in the middle called the Bull, one outside called the\r\nKing.\r\n\r\nBull: \"Where is the key of the barn-door?\"\r\n\r\nChorus: \"Go to the next-door neighbour.\"\r\n\r\nKing: \"She left the key in the church-door.\"\r\n\r\nBull: \"Steel or iron?\"\r\n\r\nHe then forces his way out of the ring, and whoever catches him becomes\r\nBull.--Berrington (Burne's _Shropshire Folk-lore_, pp. 519, 520).\r\n\r\nAnother version is that the child in the centre, whilst the others\r\ndanced around him in a circle, saying, \"Pig in the middle and can't get\r\nout,\" replies, \"I've lost my key but I will get out,\" and throws the\r\nwhole weight of his body suddenly on the clasped hands of a couple, to\r\ntry and unlock them. When he had succeeded he changed the words to,\r\n\"I've broken your locks, and I have got out.\" One of the pair whose\r\nhands he had opened took his place, and he joined the ring.--Cornwall\r\n(_Folk-lore Journal_, v. 50).\r\n\r\n(_b_) Mr. S. O. Addy says the following lines are said or sung in a game\r\ncalled \"T' Bull's i' t' Barn,\" but he does not know how it is played:--\r\n\r\n    As I was going o'er misty moor\r\n    I spied three cats at a mill-door;\r\n    One was white and one was black,\r\n    And one was like my granny's cat.\r\n    I hopped o'er t' style and broke my heel,\r\n    I flew to Ireland very weel,\r\n    Spied an old woman sat by t' fire,\r\n    Sowing silk, jinking keys;\r\n    Cat's i' t' cream-pot up to t' knees,\r\n    Hen's i' t' hurdle crowing for day,\r\n    Cock's i' t' barn threshing corn,\r\n    I ne'er saw the like sin' I was born.\r\n\r\n\r\nBulliheisle\r\n\r\nA play amongst boys, in which, all having joined hands in a line, a boy\r\nat one of the ends stands still, and the rest all wind round him.

Emslie).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA number of boys divide themselves into two sides. One side, the\r\nBuckets, stoop down, as for \"Leap-frog,\" arranging themselves one in\r\nfront of the other. The hindmost supports himself against the one in\r\nfront of him, and the front one supports himself against a wall (fig.).\r\nThey thus make an even and solid row of their backs. The other side, the\r\nBungs, leap on to the backs of the Buckets, the first one going as far\r\nup the row as possible, the second placing himself close behind the\r\nfirst, and so on. If they all succeed in getting a secure place, they\r\ncry out twice the two first lines--\r\n\r\n    Bung the Bucket,\r\n    One, two, three.\r\n    Off, off, off!\r\n\r\nIf no breakdown occurs, the Buckets count one in their favour, and the\r\nBungs repeat the process. When a breakdown occurs the Bungs take the\r\nplace of the Buckets.--Barnes, Surrey (A. B. Gomme).\r\n\r\n(_b_) Mr. Emslie, to whom I am indebted for the tune to this game, gives\r\nme the words as--\r\n\r\n    Jump a little nag-tail,\r\n    One, two, three.\r\n\r\nHe says, \"I once heard this sung three times, followed by 'Ha! ha! he!'\r\nto the tune of the last bar.\" Mr. W. R. Emslie says the game is known at\r\nBeddgelert as \"Horses, Wild Horses,\" he believes, but is not quite\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nNorthall (_Rhymes_, p. 401) describes a game very similar to this under\r\n\"Buck,\" in which the rhyme and method of play is the same as in that\r\ngame. He continues, \"This is closely allied to a game called in\r\nWarwickshire 'Jack upon the Mopstick.' But in this there is no guessing.\r\nThe leaping party must maintain their position whilst their leader\r\nsays--\r\n\r\n           Jack upon the mopstick,\r\n    One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,\r\n           Count 'em off again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBunting\r\n\r\nName for \"Tip-cat.\"--Cole's _S. W. Lincolnshire_ Glossary.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurly Whush\r\n\r\nA game played at with a ball. The ball is thrown up by one of the\r\nplayers on a house or wall, who cries on the instant it is thrown to\r\nanother to catch or kep it before it falls to the ground. They all run\r\noff but this one to a little distance, and if he fails in kepping it he\r\nbawls out \"Burly Whush;\" then the party are arrested in their flight,\r\nand must run away no farther. He singles out one of them then, and\r\nthrows the ball at him, which often is directed so fair as to strike;\r\nthen this one at which the ball has been thrown is he who gives \"Burly\r\nWhush\" with the ball to any he chooses. If the corner of a house be at\r\nhand, as is mostly the case, and any of the players escape behind it,\r\nthey must still show one of their hands past its edge to the Burly Whush\r\nman, who sometimes hits it such a whack with the ball as leaves it\r\ndirling for an hour afterwards.--Mactaggart's _Gallovidian\r\nEncyclopædia_.\r\n\r\nSee \"Ball,\" \"Keppy Ball,\" \"Monday.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nButtons\r\n\r\nTwo or more boys take two buttons in their right hands, and try to throw\r\nthem both into a small hole in the ground about two yards off. The boy\r\nwho succeeds in getting both buttons in begins first next game, and\r\ntakes a button as prize. [This seems merely a mild form of\r\nmarbles.]--Lincolnshire (Rev. ---- Roberts).\r\n\r\nThere were several games played with buttons--some on level ground, in a\r\nring or square; but the most approved was with a hole dug in the earth\r\nnear a wall, or near the trunk of a large tree. The hole should be about\r\nthe cavity of a small tea-cup, the players toeing a scratched line about\r\nfour or five feet from the hole, after tossing for first innings. Each\r\nof the players (mostly two) contribute an equal number of buttons, say\r\nfrom two to ten, and of equal value or quality. The one having first\r\nturn takes the whole of them in his hand, and by an under-throw, or\r\nrather a pitch, endeavours to get the whole, or as many as possible,\r\ninto the hole. If all go clean into the hole, he wins the game, and\r\ntakes the whole of the buttons started with; but if one or more of the\r\nbuttons are left outside the hole, the non-player has then the choice of\r\nselecting one which he considers difficult to be hit, and requesting the\r\nplayer to hit it with his _nicker_. This is made of solid lead, about\r\nthe size of a florin, but twice its substance, and each player is\r\nprovided with one of his own. Much judgment is required in making this\r\nselection, the object being to make it most difficult not only to hit\r\nit, but to prevent it being hit without being knocked into the hole, or\r\nsending the nicker in, or sending another button in, or even not\r\nstriking one at all. In any one of these cases the player loses the\r\ngame, and the non-player takes the whole of the stakes. In playing the\r\nnext game, the previous non-player becomes the player.--London (C. A. T.\r\nM.).\r\n\r\nThe following was the value of the buttons:--\r\n\r\n(1.) The plain metal 3 or 4-holed flat button, called a Sinkie, say,\r\nvalue 1 point.\r\n\r\n(2.) The same kind of button, with letters or inscription on the rim,\r\nvalued at 2 points.\r\n\r\n(3.) The small metal shank button, called a Shankie, without any\r\ninscription, valued at 3 points; if with inscription, at 4 points; the\r\nlarge sizes and corresponding description were valued relatively 4 and 5\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n(4.) The small Shankies, with a crest (livery waistcoat buttons), 6\r\npoints, and the large corresponding, 7 points.\r\n\r\n(5.) The small Shankies, with coat of arms, value 8 points, and the\r\nlarge corresponding, 9 points.\r\n\r\n(6.) Ornamental and various other buttons, such as regimental, official,\r\nmounted and engraved in flowers, and other designs according to\r\narrangement, up to 20 points.\r\n\r\nSee \"Banger,\" \"Cots and Twisses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBuzz and Bandy\r\n\r\nA local name for \"Hockey,\" which was formerly a very popular game among\r\nthe young men of Shrewsbury and Much Wenlock.

It was thus played:\r\nGoals were pitched at the distance of 150 or 200 yards from each other;\r\nthese were generally formed of the thrown-off clothes of the\r\ncompetitors. Each party has two goals, ten or fifteen yards apart. The\r\nparties, ten or fifteen on a side, stand in line, facing their own goals\r\nand each other, at about ten yards distance, midway between the goals,\r\nand nearest that of their adversaries. An indifferent spectator, agreed\r\non by the parties, throws up a ball, of the size of a common\r\ncricket-ball, midway between the confronted players, and makes his\r\nescape. It is the object of the players to seize and convey the ball\r\nbetween their own goals. The rush is therefore very great: as is\r\nsometimes the shock of the first onset, to catch the falling ball. He\r\nwho first can catch or seize it speeds therefore home, pursued by his\r\nopponents (thro' whom he has to make his way), aided by the jostlings\r\nand various assistances of his own _sidesmen_. If caught and held, or in\r\nimminent danger of being caught, he _throws_ the ball--but must in no\r\ncase give it--to a less beleaguered friend, who, if it be not arrested\r\nin its course, or be jostled away by the eager and watchful adversaries,\r\ncatches it; and he hastens homeward, in like manner pursued, annoyed,\r\nand aided, winning the notch (or snotch) if he contrive to _carry_, not\r\n_throw_, it between his goals. But this in a well-matched game is no\r\neasy achievement, and often requires much time, many doublings, detours,\r\nand exertions. I should have noticed, that if the holder of the ball be\r\ncaught with the ball in his possession, he loses a _snotch_; if,\r\ntherefore, he be hard pressed, he _throws_ it to a convenient friend,\r\nmore free and in breath than himself. At the loss (or gain) of a\r\n_snotch_, a recommence takes place, arranging which gives the parties\r\ntime to take breath. Seven or nine notches are the game--and these it\r\nwill sometimes take two or three hours to win. Sometimes a large\r\nfootball was used--and the game was then called \"Kicking Camp\"--and if\r\nplayed with the shoes on, \"Savage Camp.\"--Moor's _Suffolk Words_.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The sport and name are very old. The \"Camping pightel\" occurs in a\r\ndeed of the 30 Henry VI.--about 1486; Cullum's _Hawstead_, p. 113, where\r\nTusser is quoted in proof, that not only was the exercise manly and\r\nsalutary, but good also for the _pightel_ or meadow:\r\n\r\n    In meadow or pasture (to grow the more fine)\r\n    Let campers be camping in any of thine;\r\n    Which if ye do suffer when low is the spring,\r\n    You gain to yourself a commodious thing.\r\n\r\n--P. 65.\r\n\r\nAnd he says, in p. 56:\r\n\r\n    Get campers a ball,\r\n    To camp therewithall.\r\n\r\nRay says that the game prevails in Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex. The Rev.\r\nS. Arnot, in _Notes and Queries_, 8th series, vol. ii. p. 138, who was\r\nrector of Ilket's Hall, in the county of Suffolk, says the ball was\r\nabout the size of a cricket-ball, and was driven through a narrow goal;\r\nand from the evidence of the parish clerk it seems certain that it was\r\nnot \"Football.\" See also Spurden's _East Anglian Words_, and _County\r\nFolk-lore, Suffolk_, pp. 57-59.\r\n\r\nThere are Upper Campfield and Lower Campfield at Norton Woodseats. They\r\nare also called Camping fields. This field was probably the place where\r\nfootball and other village games were played. These fields adjoin the\r\nBocking fields. In Gosling's Map of Sheffield, 1736, Campo Lane is\r\ncalled _Camper Lane_. The same map shows the position of the old Latin\r\nschool, or grammar school, and the writing school. These schools were at\r\na very short distance from Campo Lane, and it seems probable that here\r\nthe game of football was played (Addy's _Sheffield Glossary_). \"The\r\ncamping-land appropriated to this game occurs in several instances in\r\nauthorities of the fifteenth century\" (Way's Note in _Prompt. Parv._, p.\r\n60). In Brinsley's _Grammar Schoole_, cited by Mr. Furnivall in _Early\r\nEnglish Meals and Manners_, p. lxii., is this passage: \"By this meanes\r\nalso the schollars may be kept euer in their places, and hard to their\r\nlabours, without that running out to the Campo (as they tearme it) at\r\nschool times, and the manifolde disorders thereof; as watching and\r\nstriuing for the clubbe and loytering then in the fields.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Football.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCanlie\r\n\r\nA very common game in Aberdeen, played by a number of boys, one of whom\r\nis by lot chosen to act the part of Canlie. A certain portion of a\r\nstreet or ground, as it may happen, is marked off as his territory, into\r\nwhich, if any of the other boys presume to enter, and be caught by\r\nCanlie before he can get off the ground, he is doomed to take the place\r\nof Canlie, who becomes free in consequence of the capture. The game is\r\nprevalent throughout Scotland, though differently denominated: in\r\nLanarkshire and Renfrewshire it is called \"Tig,\" and in Mearns\r\n\"Tick.\"--Jamieson.\r\n\r\nSee \"Tig.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCapie-Hole\r\n\r\nA hole is made in the ground, and a certain line drawn, called a Strand,\r\nbehind which the players must take their stations. The object is at this\r\ndistance to throw the bowl into the hole. He who does this most\r\nfrequently wins. It is now more generally called \"The Hole,\" but the old\r\ndesignation is not quite extinct. It is otherwise played in Angus. Three\r\nholes are made at equal distances. He who can first strike his bowl into\r\neach of these holes thrice in succession wins the game (Jamieson).

A messenger is sent into\r\nthe room with a letter to the Queen, who reads it, and joins the King in\r\na courteous entreaty that the bearer of the missive will place himself\r\nbetween them. When he has seated himself on the shawl, up jumps the King\r\nand Queen, and down goes the messenger on the floor.--Bottesford and\r\nAnderly (Lincolnshire), and Nottinghamshire (Miss M. Peacock).\r\n\r\n(_b_) This is virtually the same game as \"Ambassador,\" described by\r\nGrose as played by sailors on some inexperienced fellow or landsman.\r\nBetween the two chairs is placed a pail of water, into which the victim\r\nfalls.\r\n\r\n\r\nCashhornie\r\n\r\nA game played with clubs by two opposite parties of boys, the aim of\r\neach party being to drive a ball into a hole belonging to their\r\nantagonists, while the latter strain every nerve to prevent\r\nthis.--Jamieson.\r\n\r\n\r\nCastles\r\n\r\nA game at marbles. Each boy makes a small pyramid of three as a base,\r\nand one on the top. The players aim at these from a distant stroke with\r\nbalsers, winning such of the castles as they may in turn knock down\r\n(Lowsley's _Glossary of Berkshire Words_). In London, the marble alluded\r\nto as \"balser\" was called \"bonsor\" or \"bouncer\" (J. P. Emslie).\r\n\r\nSee \"Cockly Jock,\" \"Cogs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCat and Dog\r\n\r\nAn ancient game played in Angus and Lothian. Three play, and they are\r\nprovided with clubs. These clubs are called \"dogs.\" The players cut out\r\ntwo holes, each about a foot in diameter, and seven inches in depth. The\r\ndistance between them is about twenty-six feet. One stands at each hole\r\nwith a club. A piece of wood about four inches long and one inch in\r\ndiameter, called a Cat, is thrown from the one hole towards the other by\r\na third person. The object is to prevent the Cat from getting into the\r\nhole. Every time that it enters the hole, he who has the club at that\r\nhole loses the club, and he who threw the Cat gets possession both of\r\nthe club and of the hole, while the former possessor is obliged to take\r\ncharge of the Cat. If the Cat be struck, he who strikes it changes\r\nplaces with the person who holds the other club; and as often as these\r\npositions are changed one is counted in the game by the two who hold the\r\nclubs, and who are viewed as partners.--Jamieson.\r\n\r\n(_b_) This is not unlike the \"Stool-Ball\" described by Strutt (_Sports\r\nand Pastimes_, p. 76), but it more nearly resembles \"Club-Ball,\" an\r\nancient English game (ibid., p. 83). The game of \"Cat,\" played with\r\nsticks and a small piece of wood, rising in the middle, so as to rebound\r\nwhen struck on either side, is alluded to in _Poor Robin's Almanack_ for\r\n1709, and by Brand. Leigh (_Cheshire Glossary_) gives \"Scute\" as another\r\nname for the game of \"Cat,\" probably from _scute_ (O.W.), for boat,\r\nwhich it resembles in shape.\r\n\r\nSee \"Cudgel,\" \"Kit-cat,\" \"Tip-cat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCat-Beds\r\n\r\nThe name of a game played by young people in Perthshire. In this game,\r\none, unobserved by all the rest, cuts with a knife the turf in very\r\nunequal angles. These are all covered, and each player puts his hand on\r\nwhat he supposes to be the smallest, as every one has to cut off the\r\nwhole surface of his division. The rate of cutting is regulated by a\r\nthrow of the knife, and the person who throws is obliged to cut as deep\r\nas the knife goes. He who is last in getting his bed cut up is bound to\r\ncarry the whole of the clods, crawling on his hands and feet, to a\r\ncertain distance measured by the one next to him, who throws the knife\r\nthrough his legs. If the bearer of the clods let any of them fall, the\r\nrest have a right to pelt him with them. They frequently lay them very\r\nloosely on, that they may have the pleasure of pelting.--Jamieson.\r\n\r\n\r\nCat's Cradle\r\n\r\nOne child holds a piece of string joined at the ends on his upheld\r\npalms, a single turn being taken over each, and by inserting the middle\r\nfinger of each hand under the opposite turn, crosses the string from\r\nfinger to finger in a peculiar form. Another child then takes off the\r\nstring on his fingers in a rather different way, and it then assumes a\r\nsecond form. A repetition of this man[oe]uvre produces a third form,\r\nand so on. Each of these forms has a particular name, from a fancied\r\nresemblance to the object--barn-doors, bowling-green, hour-glass, pound,\r\nnet, fiddle, fish-pond, diamonds, and others.--_Notes and Queries_, vol.\r\nxi. p. 421.\r\n\r\nThe following forms are those known to me, with their names. They are\r\nproduced seriatim.\r\n\r\n  1. The cradle.\r\n  2. The soldier's bed.\r\n  3. Candles.\r\n  4. The cradle inversed, or manger.\r\n  5. Soldier's bed again, or diamonds.\r\n  6. Diamonds, or cat's eyes.\r\n  7. Fish in dish.\r\n  8. Cradle as at first.\r\n\r\nThe different orders or arrangements must be taken from the hands of one\r\nplayer by another without disturbing the arrangement.--A. B. Gomme.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Nares suggests that the proper name is \"Cratch Cradle,\" and is\r\nderived from the archaic word _cratch_, meaning a manger. He gives\r\nseveral authorities for its use. The first-made form is not unlike a\r\nmanger. Moor (_Suffolk Words_) gives the names as cat's cradle,\r\nbarn-doors, bowling-green, hour-glass, pound, net, diamonds, fish-pond,\r\nfiddle. A supposed resemblance originated them. Britton (_Beauties of\r\nWiltshire_, Glossary) says the game in London schools is called\r\n\"Scratch-scratch\" or \"Scratch-cradle.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cat's Cradle \"Taking off\" Soldier's Bed\r\n\r\n\"Taking off\" Candles \"Taking off\"\r\n\r\nCat's Cradle (upside down) Cat's Eyes Fish.]\r\n\r\nThe game is known to savage peoples. Professor Haddon noted it among the\r\nTorres Straits people, who start the game in the same manner as we do,\r\nbut continue it differently (_Journ. Anthrop. Inst._, vol. xix. p. 361);\r\nand Dr. Tylor has pointed out the significance of these string puzzles\r\namong savage peoples in _Journ. Anthrop. Inst._, ix. 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nCat-gallows\r\n\r\nA child's game, consisting of jumping over a stick placed at right\r\nangles to two others fixed in the ground.--Halliwell's _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In Ross and Stead's _Holderness Glossary_ this is called\r\n\"Cat-gallas,\" and is described as three sticks placed in the form of a\r\ngallows for boys to jump over. So called in consequence of being of\r\nsufficient height to hang cats from. Also mentioned in Peacock's _Manley\r\nand Corringham Glossary_ and Elworthy's _West Somerset Words_, Brogden's\r\n_Provincial Words, Lincs._, Dickinson's _Cumberland Glossary_,\r\nAtkinson's _Cleveland Glossary_, Brockett's _North Country Words_,\r\nEvans' _Leicestershire Glossary_, Baker's _Northants Glossary_, and\r\nDarlington's _South Cheshire Glossary_. On one of the stalls in\r\nWorcester Cathedral, figured in Wright's _Archæological Essays_, ii.\r\n117, is a carving which represents three rats busily engaged in hanging\r\na cat on a gallows of this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nCat i' the Hole\r\n\r\nA game well known in Fife, and perhaps in other counties. If seven boys\r\nare to play, six holes are made at certain distances. Each of the six\r\nstands at a hole, with a short stick in his hand; the seventh stands at\r\na certain distance holding a ball. When he gives the word, or makes the\r\nsign agreed upon, all the six change holes, each running to his\r\nneighbour's hole, and putting his stick in the hole which he has newly\r\nseized. In making this change, the boy who has the ball tries to put it\r\ninto an empty hole. If he succeeds in this, the boy who had not his\r\nstick (for the stick is the Cat) in the hole to which he had run is put\r\nout, and must take the ball. There is often a very keen contest whether\r\nthe one shall get his stick, or the other the ball, or Cat, first put\r\ninto the hole. When the Cat _is in the hole_, it is against the laws of\r\nthe game to put the ball into it.--Jamieson.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Kelly, in his _Scottish Proverbs_, p. 325, says, \"'Tine cat, tine\r\ngame;' an allusion to a play called 'Cat i' the Hole,' and the English\r\n'Kit-cat.' Spoken when men at law have lost their principal evidence.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Cat and Dog,\" \"Cudgel,\" \"Kit-cat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCat after Mouse\r\n\r\nThis game, sometimes called \"Threading the Needle,\" is played by\r\nchildren forming a ring, with their arms extended and hands clasped;\r\none--the Mouse--goes outside the circle and gently pulls the dress of\r\none of the players, who thereupon becomes the Cat, and is bound to\r\nfollow wherever the Mouse chooses to go--either in or out of the\r\nring--until caught, when he or she takes the place formerly occupied in\r\nthe ring by the Cat, who in turn becomes Mouse, and the game is\r\nrecommenced.--Dorsetshire (_Folk-lore Journal_, vii. 214).\r\n\r\n(_b_) Played at Monton, Lancashire (Miss Dendy); Clapham Middle-Class\r\nSchool (Miss Richardson); and many other places. It is practically the\r\nsame game as \"Drop Handkerchief,\" played without words. It is described\r\nby Strutt, p. 381, who considers \"Kiss-in-the-Ring\" is derived from this\r\n\"Cat and Mouse.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCatchers\r\n\r\nOne bicken is required in this game, and at this a lad must stand with a\r\nbat and ball in hand. He hits the ball away along the sand. Another boy\r\npicks it up and asks the striker \"How many?\" who replies--\r\n\r\n    Two a good scat,\r\n    Try for the bat.\r\n\r\nThe ball is then thrown to the bicken, and if it does not come within\r\nthe distance named--two bats--the striker again sends the ball away,\r\nwhen the question is again asked--\r\n\r\n    Three a good scat,\r\n    Try for the bat.\r\n\r\nAnd so on until the boy standing out throws the ball in to the required\r\ndistance.--Old newspaper cutting without date in my possession (A.

It hath foure chaunces:\r\nthe ace point, that is named Canis, or Canicula, was one of the sides;\r\nhe that cast it leyed doune a peny, or so muche as the gamers were\r\nagreed on; the other side was called Venus, that signifieth seven. He\r\nthat cast the chaunce wan sixe and all that was layd doune for the\r\ncastyng of Canis. The two other sides were called Chius and Senio. He\r\nthat did throwe Chius wan three. And he that cast Senio gained four.\r\nThis game (as I take it) _is used of children in Northfolke_, and they\r\ncal it the Chaunce Bone; they playe with three or foure of those bones\r\ntogether; it is either the same or very lyke to it.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Dibs,\" \"Hucklebones.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChange Seats, the King's Come\r\n\r\nIn this game as many seats are placed round a room as will serve all the\r\ncompany save one. The want of a seat falls on an individual by a kind of\r\nlot, regulated, as in many other games, by the repetition of an old\r\nrhythm. All the rest being seated, he who has no seat stands in the\r\nmiddle, repeating the words \"Change seats, change seats,\" &c., while all\r\nthe rest are on the alert to observe when he adds, \"the king's come,\"\r\nor, as it is sometimes expressed, change their seats. The sport lies in\r\nthe bustle in consequence of every one's endeavouring to avoid the\r\nmisfortune of being the unhappy individual who is left without a seat.\r\nThe principal actor often slily says, \"The king's _not_ come,\" when, of\r\ncourse the company ought to keep their seats; but from their anxious\r\nexpectation of the usual summons, they generally start up, which affords\r\na great deal of merriment.--Brand's _Pop. Antiq._, ii. 409.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Dr. Jamieson says this is a game well-known in Lothian and in the\r\nSouth of Scotland. Sir Walter Scott, in _Rob Roy_, iii. 153, says, \"Here\r\nauld ordering and counter-ordering--but patience! patience!--We may ae\r\nday play at _Change seats, the king's coming_.\"\r\n\r\nThis game is supposed to ridicule the political scramble for places on\r\noccasion of a change of government, or in the succession.\r\n\r\nSee \"Musical Chairs,\" \"Turn the Trencher.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCheckstone\r\n\r\nEasther's _Almondbury Glossary_ thus describes this game. A set of\r\nchecks consists of five cubes, each about half an inch at the edge, and\r\na ball the size of a moderate bagatelle ball: all made of pot. They are\r\ncalled checkstones, and the game is played thus. You throw down the\r\ncubes all at once, then toss the ball, and during its being in the air\r\ngather up one stone in your right hand and catch the descending ball in\r\nthe same. Put down the stone and repeat the operation, gathering two\r\nstones, then three, then four, till at last you have \"summed up\" all the\r\nfive at once, and have succeeded in catching the ball. In case of\r\nfailure you have to begin all over again.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In Nashe's _Lenten Stuff_ (1599) occurs the following: \"Yet\r\ntowards cock-crowing she caught a little slumber, and then she dreamed\r\nthat Leander and she were playing at checkstone with pearls in the\r\nbottom of the sea.\"\r\n\r\nA game played by children with round small pebbles (Halliwell's\r\n_Dictionary_). It is also mentioned in the early play of _Apollo\r\nShroving_, 1627, p. 49.\r\n\r\nSee \"Chucks,\" \"Fivestones.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCherry Odds\r\n\r\nA game of \"Pitch and Toss\" played with cherry-stones (Elworthy's _West\r\nSomerset Words_). Boys always speak of the stones as \"ods.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCherry-pit\r\n\r\n\"Cherry-pit\" is a play wherein they pitch cherry-stones into a little\r\nhole. It is noticed in the _Pleasant Grove of New Fancies_, 1657, and in\r\nHerrick's _Hesperides_.

One in the middle\r\ntries to catch as many as possible, forming them in a long string, hand\r\nin hand, as they are caught. Those still free try to break through the\r\nline and rescue the prisoners. If they succeed in parting the line, they\r\nmay carry one boy pig-a-back to the lamp-post, who becomes \"safe.\" The\r\nboy caught last but one becomes \"it\" in the next game.--Deptford, Kent\r\n(Miss Chase).\r\n\r\nSee \"Hunt the Staigie,\" \"Stag Warning,\" \"Whiddy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChinnup\r\n\r\nA game played with hooked sticks and a ball, also called \"Shinnup.\" Same\r\nas \"Hockey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChinny-mumps\r\n\r\nA school-boys' play, consisting in striking the chin with the knuckles;\r\ndexterously performed, a kind of time is produced.--Addy's _Sheffield\r\nGlossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nChock or Chock-hole\r\n\r\nA game at marbles played by \"chocking\" or pitching marbles in a hole\r\nmade for the purpose, instead of shooting at a ring (Northamptonshire,\r\nBaker's _Glossary_). Clare mentions the game in one of his poems.\r\n\r\n\r\nChow\r\n\r\nA game played in Moray and Banffshire. The ball is called the Chow. The\r\ngame is the same as \"Shinty.\" The players are equally divided. After the\r\nChow is struck off by one party, the aim of the other is to strike it\r\nback, that it may not reach the limit or goal on their side, because in\r\nthis case they lose the game, and as soon as it crosses the line the\r\nother party cry Hail! or say that it is hail, as denoting that they have\r\ngained the victory. In the beginning of each game they are allowed to\r\nraise the ball a little above the level of the ground, that they may\r\nhave the advantage of a surer stroke. This is called the \"deil-chap,\"\r\nperhaps as a contraction of \"devil,\" in reference to the force expended\r\non the stroke. It may, however, be \"dule-chap,\" the blow given at the\r\n\"dule\" or goal.--Jamieson.\r\n\r\nSee \"Hockey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChuck-farthing\r\n\r\nStrutt says this game was played by boys at the commencement of the last\r\ncentury, and probably bore some analogy to \"Pitch and Hustle.\" He saw\r\nthe game thus denominated played with halfpence, every one of the\r\ncompetitors having a like number, either two or four; a hole being made\r\nin the ground, with a mark at a given distance for the players to stand,\r\nthey pitch their halfpence singly in succession towards the hole, and he\r\nwhose halfpenny lies the nearest to it has the privilege of coming first\r\nto a second mark much nearer than the former, and all the halfpence are\r\ngiven to him; these he pitches in a mass toward the hole, and as many of\r\nthem as remain therein are his due; if any fall short or jump out of it,\r\nthe second player--that is, he whose halfpenny in pitching lay nearest\r\nto the first goer's--takes them and performs in like manner; he is\r\nfollowed by the others as long as any of the halfpence remain (_Sports_,\r\npp. 386, 387). There is a letter in the _Spectator_, supposed to be from\r\nthe father of a romp, who, among other complaints of her conduct, says,\r\n\"I have catched her once at eleven years old at 'Chuck-farthing' among\r\nthe boys.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChuck-hole, Chuck-penny\r\n\r\nSame game as \"Chuck-farthing,\" with this difference, that if the pennies\r\nroll outside the ring it is a \"dead heat,\" and each boy reclaims his\r\npenny.--Peacock's _Manley and Corringham Glossary_; and see Brogden's\r\n_Lincolnshire Words_.\r\n\r\n\r\nChucks\r\n\r\nA game with marbles played by girls (Mactaggart's _Gallovidian\r\nEncyclopædia_). A writer in _Blackwood's Magazine_, August 1821, p. 36,\r\nsays \"Chucks\" is played with a bowl and chucks--a species of shells\r\n(_Buccinum lapillus_) found on the sea-shore [\"bowl\" here probably means\r\na marble]. Brockett (_North Country Words_) says this game is played by\r\ngirls with five sea-shells called chucks, and sometimes with pebbles,\r\ncalled chuckie-stanes. Jamieson says a number of pebbles are spread on a\r\nflat stone; one of them is tossed up, and a certain number must be\r\ngathered and the falling one caught by the same hand.\r\n\r\nSee \"Checkstones,\" \"Fivestones.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChurch and Mice\r\n\r\nA game played in Fifeshire; said to be the same with the \"Sow in the\r\nKirk.\"--Jamieson.\r\n\r\n\r\nClick\r\n\r\nTwo Homes opposite each other are selected, and a boy either volunteers\r\nto go Click, or the last one in a race between the Homes does so. The\r\nothers then proceed to one of the Homes, and the boy takes up his\r\nposition between them. The players then attempt to run between the\r\nHomes, and if the one in the middle holds any of them while he says\r\n\"One, two, three, I catch thee; help me catch another,\" they have to\r\nstay and help him to collar the rest until only one is left. If this one\r\nsucceeds in getting between the Homes three times after all the others\r\nhave been caught, he is allowed to choose the one to go Click in the\r\nnext game; if he fails, he has to go himself.--Marlborough, Wilts (H.

The\r\nthrust-out leg was drawn back and the drawn-in leg was shot out at the\r\nsame time. This movement was repeated, each bringing down to the ground\r\nof the toe and heel causing a noise like that of hammering on a\r\nlapstone. The arms were moved backwards and forwards at the same time to\r\nimitate the cobbler's sewing.--London (J. P. Emslie).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCob-nut\r\n\r\nThe children in Yorkshire have a game which is probably an ancient\r\nEnglish pastime. Numerous hazel-nuts are strung like the beads of a\r\nrosary. The game is played by two persons, each of whom has one of these\r\nstrings, and consists in each party striking alternately, with one of\r\nthe nuts on his own string, a nut of his adversary's. The field of\r\ncombat is usually the crown of a hat. The object of each party is to\r\ncrush the nuts of his opponent. A nut which has broken many of those of\r\nthe adversary is a Cob-nut.--Brand, ii. 411; Hunter's _Hallamshire\r\nGlossary_.\r\n\r\n(_b_) This game is played in London with chestnuts, and is called\r\n\"Conquers.\" In Cornwall it is known as \"Cock-haw.\" The boys give the\r\nname of Victor-nut to the fruit of the common hazel, and play it to the\r\nwords: \"Cockhaw! First blaw! Up hat! Down cap! Victor!\" The nut that\r\ncracks another is called a Cock-battler (_Folk-lore Journal_, v. 61).\r\nHalliwell describes this game differently. He says \"it consists in\r\npitching at a row of nuts piled up in heaps of four, three at the bottom\r\nand one at the top of each heap. The nut used for the pitching is called\r\nthe Cob. All the nuts knocked down are the property of the pitcher.\"\r\nAlluding to the first described form, he says it \"is probably a more\r\nmodern game,\" and quotes Cotgrave _sub voce_ \"Chastelet\" as authority\r\nfor the earlier form in the way he describes it (_Dictionary_). Addy\r\nsays the nuts were hardened for the purpose. When a nut was broken it\r\nwas said to be \"cobbered\" or \"cobbled\" (_Sheffield Glossary_). Evans'\r\n_Leicestershire Glossary_ also describes it. Darlington (_South Cheshire\r\nWords_) says this game only differs from \"Cobblety-cuts\" in the use of\r\nsmall nuts instead of chestnuts. George Eliot in _Adam Bede_ has,\r\n\"Gathering the large unripe nuts to play at 'Cob-nut' with\" (p. 30).\r\nBritton's _Beauties of Wiltshire_ gives the Isle of Wight and Hants as\r\nother places where the game is known.\r\n\r\nSee \"Conquerors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCock\r\n\r\nOne boy is chosen Cock. The players arrange themselves in a line along\r\none side of the playground. The Cock takes his stand in front of the\r\nplayers. When everything is ready, a rush across the playground is made\r\nby the players. The Cock tries to catch and \"croon\"--_i.e._, put his\r\nhand upon the head of--as many of the players as he can when running\r\nfrom one side of the playground to the other. Those caught help the Cock\r\nin the rush back. The rush from side to side goes on till all are\r\ncaptured. To \"croon\" was the essential point in capturing. When a boy\r\nwas being pursued to be taken prisoner, his great object was, when he\r\ncame to close quarters with his pursuers, to save his head from being\r\ntouched on the crown by one of them.--Nairn (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\nAt Duthil, Strathspey, this game goes by the name of \"Rexa-boxa-King.\"\r\nWhen the players have ranged themselves on one side of the playground,\r\nand the King has taken his stand in front of them, he calls out\r\n\"Rexa-boxa-King,\" or simply \"Rexa,\" when all the players rush to the\r\nother side. The rush from side to side goes on till all are captured.\r\nThe one last captured becomes King in the next game.--Rev. W. Gregor.\r\n\r\nSee \"Click.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCock-battler\r\n\r\nChildren, under the title of \"Cock-battler,\" often in country walks play\r\nwith the hoary plantain, which they hold by the tough stem about two\r\ninches from the head; each in turn tries to knock off the head of his\r\nopponent's flower.--Cornwall (_Folk-lore Journal_, v. 61).\r\n\r\nIn the North, and in Suffolk, it is called \"Cocks,\" \"a puerile game with\r\nthe tough tufted stems of the ribwort plantain\" (Brockett's _North\r\nCountry Words_). Moor (_Suffolk Words_) alludes to the game, and\r\nHolloway (_Dictionary of Provincialisms_) says in West Sussex boys play\r\nwith the heads of rib grass a similar game. Whichever loses the head\r\nfirst is conquered. It is called \"Fighting-cocks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCock-fight\r\n\r\nThis is a boys' game. Two boys fold their arms, and then, hopping on one\r\nleg, butt each other with their shoulders till one lets down his leg.\r\nAny number of couples can join in this game.--Nairn (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\n\r\nCock-haw\r\n\r\nSee \"Cob-nut.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCock-stride\r\n\r\nOne boy is chosen as Cock. He is blindfolded, and stands alone, with his\r\nlegs as far apart as possible. The other boys then throw their caps as\r\nfar as they are able between the extended legs of the Cock (fig. 1).\r\nAfter the boys have thrown their caps, and each boy has taken his stand\r\nbeside his cap, the Cock, still blindfolded, stoops down and crawls in\r\nsearch of the caps (fig. 2). The boy whose cap he first finds has to\r\nrun about twenty yards under the buffeting of the other boys, the blows\r\nbeing directed chiefly to the head. He becomes Cock at the next turn of\r\nthe game.--Rosehearty, Pitsligo (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCockertie-hooie\r\n\r\nThis game consists simply of one boy mounting on the neck of another,\r\nputting a leg over each shoulder and down his breast. The boy that\r\ncarries takes firm hold of the legs of the one on his neck, and sets off\r\nat a trot, and runs hither and thither till he becomes tired of his\r\nburden. The bigger the one is who carries, the more is in the enjoyment\r\nto the one carried.--Keith (Rev. W.

A\r\nwitness, whose conduct was impugned as light and unbecoming, is desired\r\nto inform the court, in which an action for breach of promise was tried,\r\nthe meaning of \"mounting cockeldy-bread;\" and she explains it as \"a play\r\namong children,\" in which one lies down on the floor on her back,\r\nrolling backwards and forwards, and repeating the following lines:--\r\n\r\n    Cockeldy bread, mistley cake,\r\n    When you do that for our sake.\r\n\r\nWhile one of the party so laid down, the rest sat around; and they laid\r\ndown and rolled in this manner by turns.\r\n\r\nThese lines are still retained in the modern nursery-rhyme books, but\r\ntheir connection with the game of \"Cockeldy-bread\" is by no means\r\ngenerally understood. There was formerly some kind of bread called\r\n\"cockle-bread,\" and _cocille-mele_ is mentioned in a very early MS.\r\nquoted in Halliwell's _Dictionary_. In Peele's play of the _Old Wives'\r\nTale_, a voice thus speaks from the bottom of a well:--\r\n\r\n    Gently dip, but not too deep,\r\n    For fear you make the golden beard to weep.\r\n    Fair maiden, white and red,\r\n    Stroke me smooth and comb my head,\r\n    And thou shalt have some _cockell-bread_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCockly-jock\r\n\r\nA game among boys.

Two\r\nboys sit face to face astride of a form or a log of timber. If a piece\r\nof turf can be procured so much the better. One boy lays his chestnut\r\nupon the turf, and the other strikes at it with his chestnut; and they\r\ngo on striking alternately till one chestnut splits the other. The\r\nchestnut which remains unhurt is then \"conqueror of one.\" A new chestnut\r\nis substituted for the broken one, and the game goes on. Whichever\r\nchestnut now proves victorious becomes \"conqueror of two,\" and so on,\r\nthe victorious chestnut adding to its score all the previous winnings.\r\nThe chestnuts are often artificially hardened by placing them up the\r\nchimney or carrying them in a warm pocket; and a chestnut which has\r\nbecome conqueror of a considerable number acquires a value in\r\nschoolboys' eyes; and I have frequently known them to be sold, or\r\nexchanged for other toys (Holland's _Cheshire Glossary_). The game is\r\nmore usually played by one boy striking his opponent's nut with his own,\r\nboth boys standing and holding the string in their hands. It is\r\nconsidered bad play to strike the opponent's _string_. The nut only\r\nshould be touched. Three tries are usually allowed.\r\n\r\n(_c_) For information on various forms of this game, see _Notes and\r\nQueries_, 1878. See also Elworthy's _West Somerset Words_. The boy who\r\nfirst said the rhyme has first stroke at Oswestry. The game is elsewhere\r\ncalled \"Cobbet\" (Meole Brace) and \"Cobbleticuts\" (Burne's _Shropshire\r\nFolk-lore_, p. 531). In \"Conquer-nuts\" \"obbly\" was probably \"nobbly\" or\r\n\"knobbly,\" expressing the appearance of the string of nuts; and \"onkers\"\r\nwas probably invented as a rhyme to \"conquers\" (_Upton-on-Severn Words\r\nand Phrases_, by R. Lawson).\r\n\r\n\r\nContrary, Rules of\r\n\r\n    I.

The leader says the words as above while the ring is moving\r\nround, and then suddenly calls out whichever he chooses of the two\r\nsayings. If he says \"Hold fast!\" every one must immediately let go the\r\ncorner of the handkerchief he holds. They should all fall to the ground\r\nat once. When he says \"Let go!\" every one should retain their hold of\r\nthe handkerchief. Forfeits are demanded for every mistake.\r\n\r\nThis game, called \"Hawld Hard,\" is commonly played about Christmas-time,\r\nwhere a number hold a piece of a handkerchief. One then moves his hand\r\nround the handkerchief, saying, \"Here we go round by the rule of\r\nContrairy; when I say 'Hawld hard,' let go, and when I say 'Let go,'\r\nhawld hard.\" Forfeits are paid by those not complying with the\r\norder.--Lowsley's _Berkshire Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCop-halfpenny\r\n\r\nThe game of \"Chuck-farthing.\"--Norfolk and Suffolk (Holloway's _Dict. of\r\nProvincialisms_).\r\n\r\n\r\nCorsicrown\r\n\r\nA square figure is divided by four lines, which cross each other in the\r\ncrown or centre. Two of these lines connect the opposite angles, and two\r\nthe sides at the point of bisection. Two players play; each has three\r\nmen or flitchers. Now there are seven points for these men to move about\r\non, six on the edges of the square and one at the centre. The men\r\nbelonging to each player are not set together as at draughts, but\r\nmingled with each other. The one who has the first move may always have\r\nthe game, which is won by getting the three men on a line.--Mactaggart's\r\n_Gallovidian Encyclopædia_.\r\n\r\nSee \"Kit Cat Cannio,\" \"Noughts and Crosses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCots and Twisses\r\n\r\nA flat stone is obtained called a Hob, upon which those who are playing\r\nplace equal shares of Cots and Twisses. Cots are brass buttons, and\r\nTwisses bits of brass--a Twiss of solid brass being worth many Cots.\r\nEach player provides himself with a nice flat [key] stone, and from an\r\nagreed pitch tosses it at the Hob. If he knocks off any of the Cots and\r\nTwisses nearer to the players than the Hob is, he claims them. The other\r\nplayers try to knock the Hob away with their key-stones from any Cots\r\nand Twisses that may not have been claimed; and if any key-stone touches\r\nHob after all have thrown, the owner cannot claim any Cots and\r\nTwisses.--Earls Heaton (Herbert Hardy).\r\n\r\nEach player selects a Cast or stone to pitch with; on another stone,\r\ncalled the Hob, the Cots and Twys are placed; at some distance Scops are\r\nset in the ground. First the players pitch from the Hob to the Scop, and\r\nthe one who gets nearest goes first. He then pitches at the Hob, and if\r\nhe knocks off the stakes he has them, provided his Cast is nearer to\r\nthem than the Hob is; in failure of this, the other player tries. In\r\npitching up, one Cast may rest on another, and if the boy whose stone\r\nis underneath can lift it up to knock the other Cast away, it has to\r\nremain at the place to which it has been struck; if he does not succeed\r\nin doing this, the second player may lift off his Cast and place it by\r\nthe first. Whoever knocks off the stakes, they go to the boy whose Cast\r\nis nearest to them. The Hob and Scop are usually three yards apart. The\r\nCot was a button off the waistcoat or trousers, the Twy one off the\r\ncoat, and, as its name implies, was equal to two Cots. Formerly, when\r\ncash was much more rare than now it is amongst boys, these formed their\r\ncurrent coin. The game about 1820 seems to have been chiefly one of\r\ntossing, and was played with buttons, then common enough. Now, metal\r\nbuttons being rare, it is played with pieces of brass or copper of any\r\nshape. The expression, \"I haven't a cot,\" is sometimes used to signify\r\nthat a person is without money.--Easther's _Almondbury and Huddersfield\r\nGlossary_.\r\n\r\nSee \"Banger,\" \"Buttons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCourse o' Park\r\n\r\nThe game of \"Course of the Park\" has not been described, but is referred\r\nto in the following verse:--\r\n\r\n    \"Buff\"'s a fine sport,\r\n    And so's \"Course o' Park.\"\r\n\r\n--_The Slighted Maid_, 1663, p. 50.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrab-sowl, Crab-sow\r\n\r\nA game played with a bung or ball struck with sticks (Brogden's\r\n_Provincial Words, Lincolnshire_). This is played on Barnes Common, and\r\nis apparently a form of \"Hockey\" (A. B. Gomme).\r\n\r\n\r\nCrates\r\n\r\nThe game of \"Nine Holes.\" This is the game described by John Jones,\r\nM.D., in his book called _The Benefit of the Auncient Bathes of\r\nBuckstones_, 1572, p. 12, as having been played by ladies at Buxton for\r\ntheir amusement in wet weather. See Pegge's _Anonymiana_, 1818, p. 126,\r\nand Addy's _Sheffield Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCricket\r\n\r\nA description of this game is not given here; its history and rules and\r\nregulations are well known, and many books have been devoted to its\r\nstudy. The word \"Cricket\" is given in Lawson's _Upton-on-Severn Words\r\nand Phrases_ as a low wooden stool. He continues, \"The game of 'Cricket'\r\nwas probably a development of the older game of 'Stool-ball,' a\r\ndairymaid's stool being used for the wicket.\" Wedgwood (_Etym. Dict._)\r\nsuggests that the proper name for the bat was \"cricket-staff,\" A.-S.\r\n_criec_, a staff.\r\n\r\nSee \"Bittle-battle,\" \"Stool-ball.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCrooky\r\n\r\nAn old game called \"Crooky\" was formerly played at Portarlington,\r\nQueen's co., and Kilkee, co. Clare. Fifty years ago it was played with\r\nwooden crooks and balls, but about twenty-five years ago, or a little\r\nmore, mallets were introduced at Kilkee; while subsequently the name was\r\nchanged to \"Croquet.\" I have heard it stated that this game was\r\nintroduced by the French refugees that settled at Portarlington.--G. H.\r\nKinahan (_Folk-lore Journal_, ii. 265).\r\n\r\n\r\nCross and Pile\r\n\r\nThe game now called \"Heads and Tails\" (Halliwell's _Dictionary_). See\r\n_Nomenclator_, p. 299; Addy's _Sheffield Glossary_. Strutt points out\r\nthat anciently the English coins were stamped on one side with a cross.\r\nSee also Harland's _Lancashire Legends_, p. 139.\r\n\r\n\r\nCross-bars\r\n\r\nA boys' game.--Halliwell's _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCross-questions\r\n\r\nNares (_Glossary_) mentions this game in a quotation from Wilson's\r\n_Inconstant Lady_, 1614. \"Cross Questions and Crooked Answers\" was a\r\npopular game at juvenile parties. The players sit in a circle, and each\r\nis asked in a whisper a question by the one on his left, and receives\r\nalso in a whisper an answer to a question asked by himself of the person\r\non his right. Each player must remember both the question he was asked\r\nand the answer he received, which have at the conclusion of the round to\r\nbe stated aloud. Forfeits must be given if mistakes are made.--A. B.\r\nGomme.\r\n\r\n\r\nCross Tig\r\n\r\nOne of the players is appointed to be Tig. He calls out the name of the\r\none he intends to chase, and runs after him. Another player runs across\r\nbetween Tig and the fugitive, and then Tig runs after this cross-player\r\nuntil another player runs across between Tig and the fugitive; and so\r\non. Each time a player crosses between Tig and the player he is\r\nfollowing he leaves the original chase and follows the player who has\r\ncrossed. When he captures, or, in some places, touches one of the\r\nplayers he is following, this player becomes Tig, and the game begins\r\nagain.--Ireland (Miss Keane).\r\n\r\nThis game is known in and near London as \"Cross Touch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCry Notchil\r\n\r\nThis is an old game where boys push one of their number into a circle\r\nthey have made, and as he tries to escape push him back, crying, \"No\r\nchild of mine!\" (Leigh's _Cheshire Glossary_). He adds, \"This may be the\r\norigin of the husband's disclaimer of his wife when he 'notchils' her.\"\r\nTo \"cry notchil\" is for a man to advertise that he will not be\r\nanswerable for debts incurred by his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\nCuck-ball\r\n\r\nA game at ball.

Two holes\r\nare made in the ground at a distance of about eight or ten feet apart. A\r\nring about a foot in diameter is made round each hole. A boy stands at\r\neach hole with a stick, which he puts into the hole to guard it. Two\r\nother boys stand behind the holes, who act as bowlers. One of these\r\nthrows a small piece of wood shaped like a Cat, and tries to pitch it\r\ninto the hole. The boy guarding the hole tries to hit it with his stick.\r\nIf he succeeds, he and the boy at the other hole run to each other's\r\nplaces. Should the boy who throws the piece of wood succeed in getting\r\nit into the hole, the batsmen are out. Should the Cat fall into the ring\r\nor a span beyond, one of the bowlers picks it up, and both run to a\r\nhiding-place. They then agree as to which of them should hold the Cat.\r\nThis must be carried in such a way that it cannot be seen by the\r\nbatsmen, both boys assuming the same attitude. Both boys then resume\r\ntheir previous places. They kneel down, still keeping the same\r\nattitudes. The batsmen, keeping their sticks in the holes, then agree\r\nwhich of the two holds the Cat. One batsman runs across and puts his\r\nstick into the hole behind which the boy kneels whom they consider has\r\nthe Cat, the other then running to his place. If they are right in their\r\nguess, the holder of the Cat throws it across the ground for the\r\nopposite bowler to put it in the hole before the second batsman reaches\r\nit. If they guess wrongly, the holder of the Cat puts it into the hole\r\nas soon as the batsman runs, and they then become the batsmen for the\r\nnext game. If the batsmen leave their holes unguarded with the stick,\r\nthe catsmen can at any time put them \"out,\" by putting the Cat in a\r\nhole. If more than two boys on a side play, the others field as in\r\n\"Cricket.\"--Barnes (A. B. Gomme).\r\n\r\nSee \"Cat and Dog.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCurcuddie\r\n\r\n    I.

It always excites a hearty laugh among\r\nthe senior bystanders; but, ridiculous as it is, it gives occasion for\r\nthe display of some spirit and agility, as well as skill, there being\r\nalways an inclination to topple over. Each performer sings the verse\r\n(Chambers; Mactaggart's _Gallovidian Encyclopædia_).\r\n\r\nMr. Ballantyne says that each one apart tried to dance by throwing out\r\ntheir feet and jumping sideways.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The first syllable of this word is, says Jamieson, undoubtedly the\r\nverb _curr_, to sit on the houghs or hams. The second may be from Teut.\r\n_kudde_, a flock; _kudd-en_, coire, convenire, congregari, aggregari;\r\n_kudde wijs_, gregatim, catervatim, q. to curr together. The same game\r\nis called _Harry Hurcheon_ in the North of Scotland, either from the\r\nresemblance of one in this position to a _hurcheon_, or hedge-hog,\r\nsquatting under a bush; or from the Belg. _hurk-en_ to squat, to\r\n_hurkle_.--Jamieson.\r\n\r\nSee \"Cobbler's Hornpipe,\" \"Cutch-a-Cutchoo.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCurly Locks\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n    I.

The verses are given as \"nursery rhymes\" by Halliwell, Nos.\r\ncccclxxxiii. and ccccxciv. The tune is from Rimbault's _Nursery Rhymes_,\r\np. 70.

Peacock).\r\n\r\n\r\nCushion Dance\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--_Dancing Master_, 1686.\r\n\r\n  This music is exactly as it is printed in the book referred to.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The following is an account of the dance as it was known in\r\nDerbyshire amongst the farmers' sons and daughters and the domestics,\r\nall of whom were on a pretty fair equality, very different from what\r\nprevails in farm-houses of to-day. The \"Cushion Dance\" was a famous old\r\nNorth-country amusement, and among the people of Northumberland it is\r\nstill commonly observed. The dance was performed with boisterous fun,\r\nquite unlike the game as played in higher circles, where the conditions\r\nand rules of procedure were of a more refined order.\r\n\r\nThe company were seated round the room, a fiddler occupying a raised\r\nseat in a corner. When all were ready, two of the young men left the\r\nroom, returning presently, one carrying a large square cushion, the\r\nother an ordinary drinking-horn, china bowl, or silver tankard,\r\naccording to the possessions of the family. The one carrying the\r\ncushion locked the door, putting the key in his pocket. Both gentlemen\r\nthen went to the fiddler's corner, and after the cushion-bearer had put\r\na coin in the vessel carried by the other, the fiddler struck up a\r\nlively tune, to which the young men began to dance round the room,\r\nsinging or reciting to the music:--\r\n\r\n    Frinkum, frankum is a fine song,\r\n    An' we will dance it all along;\r\n    All along and round about,\r\n    Till we find the pretty maid out.\r\n\r\nAfter making the circuit of the room, they halted on reaching the\r\nfiddler's corner, and the cushion-bearer, still to the music of the\r\nfiddle, sang or recited:--\r\n\r\n                 Our song it will no further go!\r\n    The Fiddler: Pray, kind sir, why say you so?\r\n    The Cushion-bearer: Because Jane Sandars won't come to.\r\n    The Fiddler: She must come to, she shall come to,\r\n                 An' I'll make her whether she will or no.\r\n\r\nThe cushion-bearer and vessel-holder then proceeded with the dance,\r\ngoing as before round the room, singing \"Frinkum, frankum,\" &c., till\r\nthe cushion-bearer came to the lady of his choice, before whom he\r\npaused, placed the cushion on the floor at her feet, and knelt upon it.\r\nThe vessel-bearer then offered the cup to the lady, who put money in it\r\nand knelt on the cushion in front of the kneeling gentleman. The pair\r\nkissed, arose, and the gentleman, first giving the cushion to the lady\r\nwith a bow, placed himself behind her, taking hold of some portion of\r\nher dress. The cup-bearer fell in also, and they danced on to the\r\nfiddler's corner, and the ceremony was again gone through as at first,\r\nwith the substitution of the name of \"John\" for \"Jane,\" thus:--\r\n\r\n    The Lady:    Our song it will no further go!\r\n    The Fiddler: Pray, kind miss, why say you so?\r\n    The Lady:    Because John Sandars won't come to.\r\n    The Fiddler: He must come to, he shall come to,\r\n                 An' I'll make him whether he will or no!\r\n\r\nThe dancing then proceeded, and the lady, on reaching her choice (a\r\ngentleman, of necessity), placed the cushion at his feet. He put money\r\nin the horn and knelt. They kissed and rose, he taking the cushion and\r\nhis place in front of the lady, heading the next dance round, the lady\r\ntaking him by the coat-tails, the first gentleman behind the lady, with\r\nthe horn-bearer in the rear. In this way the dance went on till all\r\npresent, alternately a lady and gentleman, had taken part in the\r\nceremony. The dance concluded with a romp in file round the room to the\r\nquickening music of the fiddler, who at the close received the whole of\r\nthe money collected by the horn-bearer.\r\n\r\nAt Charminster the dance is begun by a single person (either man or\r\nwoman), who dances about the room with a cushion in his hand, and at the\r\nend of the tune stops and sings:--\r\n\r\n    Man:         This dance it will no further go.\r\n    Musician:    I pray you, good sir, why say you so?\r\n    Man:         Because Joan Sanderson will not come to.\r\n    Musician:    She must come to, and she shall come to,\r\n                 And she must come whether she will or no.\r\n\r\nThen the following words are sung as in the first example:--\r\n\r\n    Man:         Welcome, Joan Sanderson, welcome, welcome.\r\n    Both:        Prinkum-prankum is a fine dance,\r\n                 And shall we go dance it once again,\r\n                       And once again,\r\n                 And shall we go dance it once again?\r\n    Woman:       This dance it will no further go.\r\n    Musician:    I pray you, madam, why say you so?\r\n    Woman:       Because John Sanderson will not come to.\r\n    Musician:    He must come to, and he shall come to,\r\n                 And he must come whether he will or no.\r\n\r\nAnd so she lays down the cushion before a man, who, kneeling upon it,\r\nsalutes her, she singing--\r\n\r\n    Welcome, John Sanderson, &c.\r\n\r\nThen, he taking up the cushion, they take hands and dance round singing\r\nas before; and this they do till the whole company is taken into the\r\nring. Then the cushion is laid down before the first man, the woman\r\nsinging, \"This dance,\" &c., as before, only instead of \"come to,\" they\r\nsing \"go fro,\" and instead of \"Welcome, John Sanderson,\" &c., they sing\r\n\"Farewell, John Sanderson, farewell,\" &c., and so they go out one by\r\none as they came in.--Charminster (_Notes and Queries_, ii. 517, 518).\r\n\r\nThis description is almost the same as a seventeenth century version.\r\nThe dance is begun by a single person (either man or woman), who, taking\r\na cushion in his hand, dances about the room, and at the end of the tune\r\nhe stops and sings:--\r\n\r\n    This dance it will no further go.\r\n\r\nThe Musician answers:\r\n\r\n                 I pray you, good sir, why say you so?\r\n    Man:         Because Joan Sanderson will not come to.\r\n    Musician:    She must come to, and she shall come to,\r\n                 And she must come whether she will or no.\r\n\r\nThen he lays down the cushion before a woman, on which she kneels, and\r\nhe kisses her, singing--\r\n\r\n    Welcom, Joan Sanderson, welcom, welcom.\r\n\r\nThen he rises, takes up the cushion, and both dance, singing--\r\n\r\n    Prinkum-prankum is a fine dance,\r\n    And shall we go dance it once again,\r\n        Once again, and once again,\r\n    And shall we go dance it once again.\r\n\r\nThen, making a stop, the wo(man) sings as before--\r\n\r\n                 This dance, &c.\r\n    Musician:    I pray you, madam, &c.\r\n    Woman:       Because John Sanderson, &c.\r\n    Musician:    He must, &c.\r\n\r\nAnd so she lays down the cushion before a man, who, kneeling upon it,\r\nsalutes her, she singing--\r\n\r\n    Welcom, John Sanderson, &c.\r\n\r\nThen, he taking up the cushion, they take hands and dance round, singing\r\nas before. And thus they do till the whole company are taken into the\r\nring. And then the cushion is laid before the first man, the woman\r\nsinging, \"This dance,\" &c. (as before), only instead of \"come to,\" they\r\nsing \"go fro,\" and instead of \"Welcom, John Sanderson,\" &c., they sing\r\n\"Farewel, John Sanderson, farewel, farewel;\" and so they go out one by\r\none as they came in. _Note_, that the woman is kiss'd by all the men in\r\nthe ring at her coming in and going out, and the like of the man by the\r\nwoman.--_The Dancing Master_: London, printed by J. P., and sold by\r\nJohn Playford at his shop near the Temple Church, 1686, 7th edition.\r\n\r\nAnother version gives the words as follows:--\r\n\r\n    We've got a new sister in our degree,\r\n    And she's welcome into our companee, companee.\r\n    Mrs. Sargesson says she weänt come to,\r\n    We'll make her whether she will or no,\r\n        Will or no, will or no,\r\n    We'll maäke her whether she will or no.\r\n\r\nChildren form a ring with one in the middle, who lays a cushion on the\r\nground. They sing the first two lines, and the child in the centre\r\npoints at one, and the others dance round singing the other lines, the\r\ncentre child dragging the imaginary Mrs. Sargesson on to the cushion by\r\nforce, kissing her, and leaving her in the centre. Then Mrs. Sargesson\r\npoints at one in the ring, and the game begins again.--East Kirkby,\r\nLincolnshire (Miss Maughan). The tune sung is the same as the \"Mulberry\r\nBush.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Baker (_Northamptonshire Glossary_) says the Cushion Dance is still\r\ncontinued, with some variations, and generally closes the evening's\r\namusements. One of the young men endeavours secretly to bring in a\r\ncushion, and locks the doors, to prevent the escape of the young\r\nmaidens; then all the party unite hands and dance round three times to\r\nthe left and three times to the right, after which the company all seat\r\nthemselves, except the young man who holds the cushion. He advances to\r\nthe fiddler, and says--\r\n\r\n                    This dance it will no further go.\r\n    Fiddler:        Why say you so? why say you so?\r\n    Cushion-holder: Because the young women will not come to.\r\n    Fiddler:        They must come to, they shall come to,\r\n                    And tell them I say so.\r\n\r\nThe cushion-holder then goes to the girl he fancies most, and drops the\r\ncushion at her feet. She kneels down with him on the cushion, and he\r\nsalutes her, and they then rise and dance round and round to the\r\nfiddler. The girls then go through the same thing, saying, \"young men,\"\r\nand then \"a young man,\" &c., until the whole company have gone through\r\nthe same ceremony, which concludes with all dancing round three times,\r\nas at the commencement.\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk and London versions are reduced to a simple \"Kiss in the\r\nRing\" game, with the following verse:--\r\n\r\n    Round the cushion we dance with glee,\r\n    Singing songs so merrily;\r\n    Round the cushion we dance with glee,\r\n    Singing songs so merrily;\r\n    Yet the punishment you must bear\r\n    If you touch the cushion there.\r\n\r\n--Sporle, Norfolk (Miss Matthews).\r\n\r\n(_c_) Selden, in his _Table Talk_, thus refers to this game:--\"The Court\r\nof England is much altered. At a solemn dancing first you have the grave\r\nmeasures, then the Cervantoes and the Golliards, and this is kept up\r\nwith ceremony. At length to Trenchmore and the _Cushion Dance_; and then\r\nall the company dance, lord and groom, lady and kitchen-maid, no\r\ndistinction. But in King Charles's time there has been nothing but\r\nTrenchmore and the Cushion Dance,\" &c. The \"Whishin Dance\" (an\r\nold-fashioned dance, in which a cushion is used to kneel upon),\r\nmentioned by Dickinson (_Cumberland Glossary_), is probably the same\r\ngame or dance, \"whishin\" meaning cushion. Brockett (_North Country\r\nWords_) mentions \"Peas Straw,\" the final dance at a rustic party;\r\nsomething similar to the ancient \"Cushion Dance\" at weddings. It is also\r\nrecorded in Evans' _Leicestershire Glossary_, and by Burton in the\r\nfollowing passage from the _Anatomy of Melancholy_: \"A friend of\r\nhis reprehended him for dancing beside his dignity, belike at some\r\ncushen dance.\" In the version from East Kirkby, Lincolnshire, the\r\nexpression \"in our degree\" in the first line of the verse is apparently\r\nmeaningless, and it is probably a corruption of \"highdigees,\r\nhighdegrees,\" a dialect word for roystering, high spirits, merriment,\r\ndancing, romping. Elworthy (_Somerset Words_) gives this word, and\r\nquotes the following line from Drayton:--\r\n\r\n    Dance many a merry round and many a highdegy.\r\n\r\n--_Polyolbion_, Bk. xxv., l. 1162.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The transition from a dance to a pure game is well illustrated by\r\nthe different versions, and the connection of the dance with the\r\nceremony of marriage is obvious. A curious account of the merry-makings\r\nat marriages is given in Coverdale's _Christen State of Matrimony_,\r\n1543: \"After the banket and feast there beginneth a mad and unmannerly\r\nfashion; for the bride must be brought into an open dauncing-place. Then\r\nis there such a running, leaping, and flinging among them that a man\r\nmight think all these dauncers had cast all shame behinde them, and were\r\nbecome starke mad, and out of their wits, and that they were sworne to\r\nthe devil's daunce. Then must the bride keep foote with all dauncers,\r\nand refuse none, how scabbed, foule, drunken, rude, and shameless soever\r\nhe be. . . . After supper must they begin to pipe and daunce again of\r\nanew. And though the young persons come once towards their rest, yet can\r\nthey have no quietness.\"--1575 edit., fol. 59, rev. 60. Edward L.\r\nRimbault, writing in _Notes and Queries_, vi. 586, says it was formerly\r\nthe custom at weddings, both of the rich as well as the poor, to dance\r\nafter dinner and supper. In an old Court masque of James I.'s time,\r\nperformed at the marriage ceremony of Philip Herbert and Lady Susan (MS.\r\nin the writer's possession), it is directed that, at the conclusion of\r\nthe performance, \"after supper\" the company \"dance a round dance.\" This\r\nwas \"dancing the bride to bed.\" William Chappell (_Notes and Queries_,\r\nii. 442) says, \"I have a tune called 'A round dance to dance the bride\r\nto bed.' It dates from about 1630, or earlier, and resembles that of\r\n'The Hunt is up.'\" Dancing was considered so essential at weddings\r\n(according to Grose) that if in a family the youngest daughter should\r\nchance to be married before her elder sisters, they must dance at her\r\nwedding without shoes. May not the custom of throwing of old and\r\nworn-out shoes after the bride have arisen from the practice of dancing?\r\nThe danced-out shoes may have been the ones used. It is curious that the\r\ncushion is used in the marriage ceremonies of the Brahmins. Mr. Kearns,\r\nin his _Marriage Ceremonies of the Hindoos of the South of India_, p. 6,\r\nsays that a stool or cushion is one of the preparations for the\r\nreception of the bridegroom, who on entering the apartment sits down on\r\nthe stool which is presented to him. He says, \"I step on this for the\r\nsake of food and other benefits, on this variously splendid footstool.\"\r\nThe bride's father then presents to him a cushion made of twenty leaves\r\nof cúsa grass, holding it up with both hands and exclaiming, \"The\r\ncushion! the cushion! the cushion!\" The bridegroom replies, \"I accept\r\nthe cushion,\" and taking it, places it on the ground under his feet,\r\nwhile he recites a prayer. It is probable that we may have in the\r\n\"Cushion Dance\" the last relics of a very ancient ceremony, as well as\r\nevidence of the origin of a game from custom.\r\n\r\n\r\nCutch-a-Cutchoo\r\n\r\nChildren clasp their hands under their knees in a sitting posture, and\r\njump thus about the room. The one who keeps up longest wins the\r\ngame.--Dublin (Mrs. Lincoln).\r\n\r\n(_b_) In _Notes and Queries_, x. 17, \"E. D.\" says this amusement was\r\nfashionable sixty years ago, and from the low dresses worn then by\r\nladies he mentions its indecency. He gives extracts from a satire called\r\n_Cutchacutchoo, or the Jostling of the Innocents_, 2nd ed., Dublin, in\r\nwhich the game and position are mentioned--\r\n\r\n    Now she with tone tremendous cries\r\n    Cutchacutchoo.\r\n    Let each squat down upon her ham,\r\n    Jump like a goat, puck like a ram.\r\n\r\n\"Uneda,\" at same reference (x. 17), speaks of it as a known game in\r\nPhiladelphia. The analogy which this game has to some savage dances is\r\ncurious; a correspondent in _Notes and Queries_, ix. 304, draws\r\nattention to the illustration, in Richardson's _Expedition to Arctic\r\nShores_ (vol. i. p. 397), of a dance by the \"Kutchin-Kutcha\" Indians, a\r\nparallel to the name as well as the dance which needs some research in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nSee \"Curcuddie,\" \"Hop-frog.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCutters and Trucklers\r\n\r\nA remembrance of the old smuggling days.

The successful adventurer is\r\nthe person who puts the pin between two leaves including a picture which\r\nis the prize, and the pin itself is the forfeit (_Blackwood's Magazine_,\r\nAug. 1821, p. 36). This was a general school game in West London in\r\n1860-1866 (G. L. Gomme).\r\n\r\n\r\nDab-an-thricker\r\n\r\nA game in which the _dab_ (a wooden ball) is caused to spring upwards by\r\na blow on the _thricker_ (trigger), and is struck by a flat,\r\nbottle-shaped mallet fixed to the end of a flexible wand, the distance\r\nit goes counting so many for the striker.--Ross and Stead's _Holderness\r\nGlossary_.\r\n\r\nThis is the same as \"Knur and Spell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDab-at-the-hole\r\n\r\nA game at marbles (undescribed).--Patterson's _Antrim and Down\r\nGlossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDalies\r\n\r\nA child's game, played with small bones or pieces of hard wood. The\r\n_dalies_ were properly sheep's trotters.--Halliwell's _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\nEvidently the same game as \"Fivestones\" and \"Hucklebones.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDavie-drap\r\n\r\nChildren amuse themselves on the braesides i' the sun, playing at \"Hide\r\nand Seek\" with this little flower, accompanying always the hiding of it\r\nwith this rhyme, marking out the circle in which it is hid with the\r\nforefinger:--\r\n\r\n    Athin the bounds o' this I hap,\r\n    My black and bonny davie-drap;\r\n    Wha is here the cunning yin\r\n    My davie-drap to me will fin.\r\n\r\n\r\n--Mactaggart's _Gallovidian Encyclopædia_.\r\n\r\nThe davie-drap is a little black-topped field-flower.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeadily\r\n\r\nA school game, not described.--Mactaggart's _Gallovidian Encyclopædia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiamond Ring\r\n\r\n    My lady's lost her diamond ring;\r\n    I pitch upon you to find it!\r\n\r\nChildren sit in a ring or in a line, with their hands placed together\r\npalm to palm, and held straight, the little finger down-most between the\r\nknees. One of them is then chosen to represent a servant, who takes a\r\nring, or some other small article as a substitute, between her two\r\npalms, which are pressed flat together like those of the rest, and goes\r\nround the circle or line placing her hands into the hands of every\r\nplayer, so that she is enabled to let the ring fall wherever she pleases\r\nwithout detection. After this she returns to the first child she\r\ntouched, and with her hands behind her says the above words. The child\r\nwho is thus addressed must guess who has the ring, and the servant\r\nperforms the same ceremony with each of the party. They who guess right\r\nescape, but the rest forfeit. Should any one in the ring exclaim \"I have\r\nit!\" she also forfeits; nor must the servant make known who has the ring\r\nuntil all have guessed under the same penalty. The forfeits are\r\nafterwards cried as usual.--Halliwell's _Nursery Rhymes_, p. 223.\r\n\r\n(_b_) This game was a general favourite at juvenile parties years ago.\r\nThe hands were held in the posture described by Halliwell, but any child\r\nwas pitched upon for the first finder, and afterwards the child in whose\r\nhands the ring was found had to be finder. There was no guessing; the\r\nclosed hands were looked into (A. B. Gomme). Mr. Addy has collected a\r\nsimilar game called \"My lady's lost a gold ring,\" and Mr. Newell (_Games\r\nand Songs of American Children_, p. 150) has another, \"Hold fast my gold\r\nring.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDibbs\r\n\r\nA game played with the small knuckle-bones taken from legs of mutton;\r\nthese bones are themselves called \"dibs\" (Lowsley's _Glossary of\r\nBerkshire Words_). Holloway's _Dictionary_ says five of these bones are\r\nused by boys, with which they play a game called \"Dibs\" in West Sussex.\r\n\r\nSee \"Check-stones,\" \"Fivestones,\" \"Hucklebones.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDinah\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n    No one in the house but Dinah, Dinah,\r\n    No one in the house I know, I know;\r\n    No one in the house but Dinah, Dinah,\r\n        Playing on the old banjo.\r\n\r\nA ring is formed, and a girl stands blindfolded inside. As the verse is\r\nsung and finished, Dinah goes to any one in the ring, and, if successful\r\nin guessing her name, takes her place, the other taking the place of\r\nDinah, the game going on as before.--Earls Heaton (Herbert Hardy).\r\n\r\n\"Dinah\" was a Christy Minstrel song in the \"fifties.\" It is probable\r\nthat the game, which resembles \"Buff,\" has been played to the tune of\r\nthe song. Singing a chorus would soon follow.\r\n\r\nSee \"Buff,\" \"Muffin Man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDip o' the Kit\r\n\r\nA rustic game, undescribed and marked as obsolescent.--Peacock's _Manley\r\nand Corringham Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDish-a-loof\r\n\r\nA singular rustic amusement. One lays his hand down on a table, another\r\nclashes his upon it, a third his on that, and so on (fig. 1). When all\r\nthe players have done this, the one who has his hand on the board pulls\r\nit out and lays it on the one uppermost (fig. 2): they all follow in\r\nrotation, and so a continual clashing and dashing is kept up; hence\r\nthe name \"Dish.\" Those who win the game are those who stand out\r\nlongest--viz., those who are best at enduring pain. Tender hands could\r\nnot stand it a moment: one dash of a rustic \"loof\" would make the blood\r\nspurt from the tip of every finger. It is a piece of pastime to country\r\nlads of the same nature as \"Hard Knuckles\" (Mactaggart's _Gallovidian\r\nEncyclopædia_). This is a well-known game for small children in London.\r\nAfter each child's hands have been withdrawn and replaced on top as many\r\ntimes as possible without deranging the order, a general scramble and\r\nknocking of hands together ends the game (A. B. Gomme). Jamieson\r\n(_Etymological Dict._) gives this as a sport of children.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nSee \"Dump,\" \"Green Grass,\" \"Hot Cockles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDoddart\r\n\r\nA game played in a large level field with a bent stick called \"doddart.\"\r\nTwo parties, headed by two captains, endeavour to drive a wooden ball to\r\ntheir respective boundaries (Halliwell's _Dictionary_). Brockett (_North\r\nCountry Words_) adds to this that the captains are entitled to choose\r\ntheir followers by alternate votes. A piece of globular wood called an\r\n\"orr\" or \"coit\" is thrown down in the middle of the field and driven to\r\none of two opposite hedges--the alley, hail-goal, or boundary. The same\r\ngame as \"Clubby,\" \"Hockey,\" \"Shinney,\" \"Shinneyhaw.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDoncaster Cherries\r\n\r\nOne boy kneels, holding a long rope, the other end of which is held by\r\nanother boy; the other players stand round about with handkerchiefs in\r\nhands, knotted. The one who holds the rope-end and standing cries out--\r\n\r\n    Doncaster cherries, ripe and sound;\r\n    Touch 'em or taste 'em--\r\n        Down, you dogs!\r\n\r\n--Earls Heaton, Yorkshire (H. Hardy).\r\n\r\nThis is evidently a version of \"Badger the Bear,\" with a different and\r\napparently degraded formula.\r\n\r\n\r\nDools\r\n\r\nA school game. The dools are places marked with stones, where the\r\nplayers always remain in safety--where they dare neither be caught by\r\nthe hand nor struck with balls. It is only when they leave these places\r\nof refuge that those out of the doons have any chance to gain the game\r\nand get in; and leave the doons they frequently must--this is the nature\r\nof the game. Now this game seems to have been often played in reality by\r\nour ancestors about their doon-hills.--Mactaggart's _Gallovidian\r\nEncyclopædia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDown in the Valley\r\n\r\n    I.

Two others face\r\neach other, holding both hands across the other two. They see-saw\r\nbackwards and forwards, singing the lines (fig. 1). One girl gets inside\r\nthe enclosing hands (fig. 2), and they repeat till all four have \"popped\r\nunder\" (fig. 3), when they \"jog\" up and down till they fall on the\r\nfloor! (fig. 4). At Ellesmere only _two_ girls join hands, and as many\r\n\"pop under\" as they can encircle. The Lincolnshire and Norfolk versions\r\nare played practically in the same way. In the Liphook version the\r\nchildren stand in two and two opposite to each other; the children on\r\none side of the square hold hands up at the third line, and the other\r\ntwo children run under the hands of the first two. There is no pause,\r\nbut the verse is sung time after time, so that the four children are\r\nnearly always moving. In the other Hampshire version four girls stand in\r\na square, each holding the hands of the one opposite to her, pulling\r\neach other's hands backwards and forwards singing the lines. Two arms\r\nare then raised, and one girl comes under; this is repeated till all\r\nfour girls have come under the arms, then their arms encircle each\r\nother's waists and they dance round. In the Scottish version there are\r\nonly two girls who join hands and pull each other backwards and\r\nforwards, repeating the words. Halliwell describes a different action to\r\nany of these. A string of children, hand in hand, stand in a row. A\r\nchild stands in front of them as leader; two other children form an\r\narch, each holding both of the hands of the other. The string of\r\nchildren pass under the arch, the last of whom is taken captive by the\r\ntwo holding hands. The verses are repeated until all are\r\ntaken.--Halliwell's _Nursery Rhymes_, cclxxxvii.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig.

+---+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n\r\nThe analysis shows that the majority of the variants retain four\r\nprincipal incidents of what must have been the original form of the\r\ngame, and the fact of the Gloucestershire version having come down with\r\nonly two of the incidents, namely, the two most common to all the\r\nvariants (12 and 14), shows that the game has been in a state of\r\ndecadence. The four principal incidents, Nos. 1, 4, 12, and 14, point\r\ndistinctly to some water ceremonial; and if it may be argued that the\r\nincidents which occur in only one or two of the variants may be\r\nconsidered to have belonged to the original type, we shall be able to\r\nsuggest that this game presents a dramatic representation of ancient\r\nwell-worship. The incidents which occur in one version only are those\r\ngiven by Mr. Halliwell, and unfortunately the locality from which he\r\nobtained this variant is unknown. Still it is an earlier version than\r\nthose which are now printed for the first time, and may without doubt be\r\nlooked upon as genuine. Taking all the incidents of the various versions\r\nas the means by which to restore the earliest version, it would appear\r\nthat this might have consisted of the following lines:--\r\n\r\n    Draw a pail of water\r\n    For a lady's daughter;\r\n    Her father's a king, her mother's a queen,\r\n    Her two little sisters are dressed in green,\r\n    Stamping grass and parsley, marigold leaves and daisies;\r\n    Sift the lady's oatmeal, sift it into flour,\r\n    Put it in a chestnut tree, let it lie an hour;\r\n    Give a silver pin and a gold ring,\r\n    One and a hush! two and a rush!\r\n    Pray, young lady, pop under a bush;\r\n    My bush is too high, my bush is too low,\r\n    Please, young lady, come under my bow!\r\n\r\n(_d_) This restoration of the words, though it probably is far from\r\ncomplete, and does not make so good a game rhyme as the reduced\r\nversions, nevertheless shows clearly enough that the incidents belong to\r\na ceremonial of primitive well-worship. The pulling of the hands\r\nbackwards and forwards may be taken to indicate the raising of water\r\nfrom a well. If this is conceded, the incidents might be grouped as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  (1.) Drawing of water from a well.\r\n  (2.) For a devotee at the well.\r\n  (3.) Collecting flowers for dressing the well.\r\n  (4.) Making of a cake for presentation.\r\n  (5.) Gifts to the well [the silver pin, gold ring, and probably the\r\n       garter].\r\n  (6.) Command of silence.\r\n  (7.) The presence of the devotee at the sacred bush.\r\n\r\nAll these are incidents of primitive well-worship (see Gomme's\r\n_Ethnology and Folk-lore_, pp. 82-103). Garland dressing is very\r\ngeneral; cakes were eaten at Rorrington well, Shropshire (Burne's\r\n_Shropshire Folk-lore_, p. 433); pins and portions of the dress are very\r\ngeneral offerings; silence is strictly enforced in many instances, and a\r\nsacred tree or bush is very frequently found near the well.\r\n\r\nThe tune of the Hampshire game (Miss Mendham's version) is practically\r\nthe same as that of the \"Mulberry Bush.\"\r\n\r\nNewell (_Games of American Children_, p. 90) gives a version of this\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrawing Dun out of the Mire\r\n\r\nBrand, quoting from \"an old collection of satires, epigrams, &c.,\" says\r\nthis game is enumerated among other pastimes:\r\n\r\n    At shove-groat, venter-point, or crosse and pile,\r\n    At leaping o'er a Midsummer bone-fier,\r\n    Or at _the drawing Dun out of the myer_.\r\n\r\nSo in the _Dutchesse of Suffolke_, 1631:\r\n\r\n    Well done, my masters, lends your hands,\r\n    _Draw Dun out of the ditch_,\r\n    Draw, pull, helpe all, so, so, well done.\r\n    [_They pull him out._]\r\n\r\nThey had shoved Bishop Bonner into a well, and were pulling him out.\r\n\r\nWe find this game noticed at least as early as Chaucer's time, in the\r\n_Manciple's Prologue_:\r\n\r\n    Then gan our hoste to jape and to play,\r\n    And sayd, sires, what? _Dun is in the mire._\r\n\r\nNares (_Glossary_) says this game was a rural pastime, in which _Dun_\r\nmeant a dun horse, supposed to be stuck in the mire, and sometimes\r\nrepresented by one of the persons who played.\r\n\r\nGifford (_Ben Jonson_, vol. vii. p. 283), who remembered having played\r\nat the game (doubtless in his native county, Devonshire), thus describes\r\nit:--\"A log of wood is brought into the midst of the room: this is Dun\r\n(the cart horse), and a cry is raised that he is stuck in the mire. Two\r\nof the company advance, either with or without ropes, to draw him out.\r\nAfter repeated attempts they find themselves unable to do it, and call\r\nfor more assistance. The game continues till all the company take part\r\nin it, when Dun is extricated of course; and the merriment arises from\r\nthe awkward and affected efforts of the rustics to lift the log, and\r\nsundry arch contrivances to let the ends of it fall on one another's\r\ntoes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDrop Handkerchief\r\n\r\nThis is a game similar to Cat and Mouse, but takes its name from the use\r\nof the handkerchief to start the pursuit. Various rhyming formulæ are\r\nused in some places. In Monton, Lancashire (Miss Dendy), no rhyme is\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThe children stand in a ring. One runs round with a handkerchief and\r\ndrops it; the child behind whom it is dropped chases the dropper, the\r\none who gets home first takes the vacant place, the other drops the\r\nhandkerchief again.\r\n\r\nIn Shropshire the two players pursue one another in and out of the ring,\r\nrunning under the uplifted hands of the players who compose it: the\r\npursuer carefully keeping on the track of the pursued (Burne's\r\n_Shropshire Folk-lore_, p. 512).\r\n\r\nThe Dorsetshire variant is accompanied by a rhyme:\r\n\r\n    I wrote a letter to my love;\r\n    I carried water in my glove;\r\n    And by the way I dropped it--\r\n    I dropped it, I dropped it, I dropped it, &c.\r\n\r\nThis is repeated until the handkerchief is stealthily dropped\r\nimmediately behind one of the players, who should be on the alert to\r\nfollow as quickly as possible the one who has dropped it, who at once\r\nincreases her speed and endeavours to take the place left vacant by her\r\npursuer. Should she be caught before she can succeed in doing this she\r\nis compelled to take the handkerchief a second time. But if, as it\r\nmore usually happens, she is successful in accomplishing this, the\r\npursuer in turn takes the handkerchief, and the game proceeds as\r\nbefore.--Symondsbury (_Folk-lore Journal_, vi. 212).\r\n\r\n    Jack lost his supper last night,\r\n    And the night before; if he does again to-night,\r\n    He never will no more--more--more--more.\r\n\r\n    I wrote a letter to my love,\r\n    And on the way I dropt it;\r\n    Some of you have picked it up,\r\n    And got it in your pocket--pocket--pocket--pocket.\r\n\r\n    I have a little dog, it won't bite you--\r\n    It won't bite you--it won't bite you--\r\n    It _will_ bite you.\r\n\r\n--Leicestershire (Miss Ellis).\r\n\r\nThe Forest of Dean version is the same as the Dorsetshire, except that\r\nthe child who is unsuccessful in gaining the vacant place has to stand\r\nin the middle of the ring until the same thing happens to another\r\nchild.--Miss Matthews.\r\n\r\nIn Nottinghamshire the children form in a ring; one walks round outside\r\nthe ring singing and carrying a handkerchief:\r\n\r\n    I wrote a letter to my love, and on the way I dropt it;\r\n    One of you has picked it up and put it in your pocket.\r\n    It isn't you, it isn't you, &c. &c.; it is you.\r\n\r\nThe handkerchief is then dropped at some one's back, the one at whose\r\nback the handkerchief was dropped chasing the other.\r\n\r\nOr they say:\r\n\r\n    I lost my supper last night, I lost it the night before,\r\n    And if I lose it again to-night, I'll knock at somebody's door.\r\n    It isn't you, it isn't you, &c. &c.; it's you.\r\n\r\n--Miss Winfield.\r\n\r\nAt Winterton and Lincoln the children form a circle, standing\r\narms-length apart. A child holding a handkerchief occupies the centre of\r\nthe ring and sings:\r\n\r\n    Wiskit-a-waskit,\r\n    A green leather basket;\r\n    I wrote a letter to my love,\r\n    And on the way I lost it;\r\n    Some of you have picked it up,\r\n    And put it in your pocket.\r\n    I have a little dog at home,\r\n    And it shan't bite you,\r\n\r\n(Here the singer points to each child in turn)\r\n\r\n    Nor you, nor you, nor you;\r\n    But it shall bite _you_.\r\n\r\nThen she drops the handkerchief before her chosen playmate, who chases\r\nher in and out of the ring under the arms of the other children until\r\nshe is captured. The captor afterwards takes the place in the centre,\r\nand the original singer becomes a member of the circle.--Miss M.\r\nPeacock.\r\n\r\nThe Deptford version of the verse is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    I had a little dog whose name was Buff,\r\n    I sent him up the street for a penny'orth of snuff,\r\n    He broke my box and spilt my snuff,\r\n    I think my story is long enough--\r\n    'Tain't you, and 'tain't you, and 'tis you!\r\n\r\n--Deptford, Kent (Miss Chase).\r\n\r\nA Staffordshire and Sharleston version gives some altogether different\r\nformulæ:--\r\n\r\n                   What colour's the sky?\r\n                     Blue.\r\n                   Look up again.\r\n                     Like a W.\r\n    Follow me through every little hole that I go through.\r\n\r\n--Staffordshire (Rev. G. T. Royds, Rector of Haughton).\r\n\r\nAt Sharleston the centre child says, \"What colour is t' sky?\" The other\r\nanswers, \"Blue.\" Centre child says, \"Follow me true.\" Here the centre\r\nchild runs in and out between the others until the one who was touched\r\ncatches her, when they change places, the first joining the children in\r\nthe ring.--Sharleston (Miss Fowler).\r\n\r\nAt Beddgelert, Wales (Mrs. Williams), this game is called Tartan Boeth.\r\nIt is played in precisely the same manner as the English game, but the\r\nwords used are:\r\n\r\n    Tartan Boeth, Oh ma'en llosgi, Boeth iawn\r\n    Hot Tart. Oh, it burns! very hot!\r\n\r\nAt the words, \"Very hot!\" the handkerchief is dropped.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In this game no kissing takes place, and that this is no mere\r\naccidental omission may be shown by Mr. Udal's description of the\r\nDorsetshire game. He was assured by several persons who are interested\r\nin Dorset Children's Games that the indiscriminate kissing (that is,\r\nwhether the girl pursued runs little or far, or, when overtaken, whether\r\nshe objects or not) with which this game is ordinarily associated, as\r\nplayed now both in Dorset and in other counties, was not indigenous to\r\nthis county, but was merely a pernicious after-growth or outcome of\r\nlater days, which had its origin in the various excursion and holiday\r\nfêtes, which the facilities of railway travelling had instituted, by\r\nbringing large crowds from the neighbouring towns into the country. He\r\nwas told that thirty years ago such a thing was unknown in the country\r\ndistricts of Dorset, when the game then usually indulged in was known\r\nmerely as \"Drop the Handkerchief\" (_Folk-lore Journal_, vii. 212).\r\n\r\nIn other cases the rhymes are used for a purely kissing game, for which\r\nsee \"Kiss in the Ring.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDropping the Letter\r\n\r\nAn undescribed Suffolk boys' game.--Moor's _Suffolk Words_, p. 238.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuck under the Water\r\n\r\nEach child chooses a partner, and form in couples standing one before\r\nthe other, till a long line is formed. Each couple holds a handkerchief\r\nas high as they can to form an arch. The couple standing at the end of\r\nthe line run through the arch just beyond the last couple standing at\r\nthe top, when they stand still and hold their handkerchief as high as\r\npossible, which is the beginning of the second arch; this is repeated by\r\nevery last couple in succession, so that as many arches as are wanted\r\ncan be formed.--East Kirkby, Lincolnshire (Miss K. Maughan).\r\n\r\nMiss Baker (_Northamptonshire Glossary_) says the game is played in that\r\ncounty. Formerly in the northern part of the county even married women\r\non May Day played at it under the May garland, which was extended from\r\nchimney to chimney across the village street.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuck at the Table\r\n\r\nA boys' game, played with round stones and a table-shaped block of\r\nstone.--Patterson's _Antrim and Down Glossary_.\r\n\r\nProbably the same as Duckstone.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuck Dance\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--London (A.

The tune given is that to which I as a child was taught\r\nto sing the verses as a song. We did not know it as a game.

A flattish stone is evidently the best\r\nfor this sport.\r\n\r\n(_b_) This game is also given by Mr. Addy in his _Sheffield Glossary_,\r\nand by Holland (_Cheshire Glossary_), Brogden (_Provincial Words,\r\nLincolnshire_), Lowsley (_Berkshire Glossary_), Nares' _Glossary_, and\r\nBaker's _Northants Glossary_. Miss Courtenay gives \"Scutter\" and \"Tic\r\nTac Mollard\" as Cornish names for the game (_West Cornwall Glossary_).\r\nSee also Halliwell's _Nursery Rhymes_, p. 139, and Strutt's _Sports and\r\nPastimes_, p. 326.\r\n\r\nButler, in his _Hudibras_ (p. ii. canto iii. l. 302), makes it one of\r\nthe important qualifications of his conjurer to tell--\r\n\r\n    What figur'd slates are best to make\r\n    On wat'ry surface _duck_ or _drake_.\r\n\r\nThe following description of this sport is given by Minucius Felix, ed.\r\n1712, p. 28, which evinces its high antiquity: \"Pueros videmus certatim\r\ngestientes, testarum in mare jaculationibus ludere. Is lusus est, testam\r\nteretem, jactatione fluctuum lævigatam, legere de litore: eam testam\r\nplano situ digitis comprehensam, inclinem ipsum atque humilem, quantum\r\npotest, super undas irrorare: ut illud jaculum vel dorsum maris raderet,\r\nvel enataret, dum leni impetu labitur; vel summis fluctibus tonsis\r\nemicaret, emergeret, dum assiduo saltu sublevatur. Is se in pueris\r\nvictorem ferebat, cujus testa et procurreret longius, et frequentius\r\nexsiliret.\"\r\n\r\n\"From this pastime,\" says Moor, \"has probably arisen the application of\r\nthe term to a spendthrift--of whose approaching ruin we should thus\r\nspeak: 'Ah, he'ave made fine ducks and drakes of a's money, that a'\r\nhave.'\"--_Suffolk Words._\r\n\r\n\r\nDuckstone\r\n\r\nA large stone called the Duckstone or Duck-table is placed on the\r\nground, generally with a wall for a background, but this is of little\r\nconsequence. Several boys take a stone each, and a place pretty near the\r\nDuckstone is chosen for \"home.\" One of the boys puts his stone on the\r\nDuckstone, and he is called the Tenter. He has to guard the home and\r\ncatch the other boys if he can. Each boy in turn throws his stone at the\r\nstone on the Duck-table and immediately runs home. The Tenter tries to\r\ncatch him before he can touch the wall or post or whatever is chosen for\r\nthe home. If the Tenter can catch him he becomes Tenter, and puts his\r\nstone on the Duckstone, and the original Tenter takes his turn in\r\nthrowing. One rule of the game is that the Tenter's stone must always be\r\non the Duck-table when he is trying to catch a boy, so if it is knocked\r\noff it must be replaced before he can try to catch the boy running\r\n\"home.\" The chance of getting home is increased for the boy who knocks\r\nit off.--North-West Lincolnshire (Rev. ---- Roberts and Miss Peacock).\r\n\r\n(_b_) Similar versions are from Earls Heaton (Herbert Hardy), Ireland\r\n(_Folk-lore Journal_, ii. 265), Peacock (_Mauley and Corringham\r\nGlossary_). Addy (_Sheffield Glossary_) gives this game with the\r\nfollowing addition: If a duck falls short of the Duckstone, and the one\r\nwhose duck is on the stone sees that he can _wand_ or _span_ with his\r\nhand the distance between the duck thus thrown and the Duckstone, he\r\nshouts out \"Wands,\" and if he can wand or span the distance he takes his\r\nduck off, and the duck thus thrown is put on. Holland (_Cheshire\r\nGlossary_), Darlington (South Cheshire), Baker (_Northants Glossary_),\r\nand Brogden (_Provincial Words, Lincolnshire_), also give this game.\r\nElworthy (_West Somerset Words_) calls it \"Duck,\" and \"Ducks off\" and\r\n\"Cobbs off\" in Dorsetshire. In London the boy repeats the words, \"Gully,\r\ngully, all round the hole, one duck on,\" while he is playing (_Strand\r\nMagazine_, November 1891). Newell (_Games_, p. 188) calls it \"Duck on a\r\nRock.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDuffan Ring\r\n\r\nName for \"Cat and Mouse\" in Cornwall.--_Folk-lore Journal_, v. 57.\r\n\r\n\r\nDumb Crambo\r\n\r\nAn undescribed game mentioned in Moor's _Suffolk Words_, p. 238.\r\n\r\n\r\nDumb Motions\r\n\r\nTwo sides are chosen, which stand apart from each other inside the line\r\nof their den. One side chooses a trade, and goes to the opposite side\r\nimitating working at the trade and giving the initial letters of it. If\r\nthe opposite side guesses the name of the trade, the players run to\r\ntheir own den, being chased by their opponents. If any of the players\r\nare caught they must go to the opposite side. In turn the opposite side\r\nchooses a trade, and imitates the actions practised.--Cork, Ireland\r\n(Miss Keane).\r\n\r\nThis is called \"An Old Woman from the Wood\" in Dorsetshire. The children\r\nform themselves into two ranks.\r\n\r\n    The first rank says:\r\n                  Here comes an old 'oman from the wood.\r\n    The second party answers:\r\n                  What cans't thee do?\r\n    First Party:  Do anythin'.\r\n    Second Party: Work away.\r\n\r\nThis the children proceed to do, some by pretending to sew, some to\r\nwash, some to dig, some to knit, without any instruments to do it with.\r\nIf the opposite side guess what they are doing, they change sides. This\r\ngame, Miss Summers believes, is very old, and has been played by several\r\ngenerations in the village of Hazelbury Bryan.--Dorsetshire (_Folk-lore\r\nJournal_, vii. 230).\r\n\r\nSee \"Trades.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDump\r\n\r\nA boys' amusement in Yorkshire, in vogue about half a century ago, but\r\nnow believed to be nearly obsolete. It is played in this manner. The\r\nlads crowd round and place their fists endways, the one on the other,\r\ntill they form a high pile of hands. Then a boy, who has one hand free,\r\nknocks the piled fists off one by one, saying to every boy as he strikes\r\nhis fist away, \"What's there, Dump?\" He continues this process till he\r\ncomes to the last fist, when he exclaims:--\r\n\r\n             What's there?\r\n           Cheese and bread, and a mouldy halfpenny!\r\n             Where's my share?\r\n           I put it on the shelf, and the cat got it.\r\n             Where's the cat?\r\n           She's run nine miles through the wood.\r\n             Where's the wood?\r\n           T' fire burnt it.\r\n             Where's the fire?\r\n           T' waters sleekt (extinguished) it.\r\n             Where's the water?\r\n           T' oxen drank it.\r\n             Where's the oxen?\r\n           T' butcher killed 'em.\r\n             Where's the butcher?\r\n    Upon the church tops cracking nuts, and you may go and eat the\r\n      shells; and them as speaks first shall have nine nips,\r\n      nine scratches, and nine boxes over the lug!\r\n\r\nEvery one then endeavours to refrain from speaking in spite of mutual\r\nnudges and grimaces, and he who first allows a word to escape is\r\npunished by the others in the various methods adopted by schoolboys. In\r\nsome places the game is played differently. The children pile their\r\nfists in the manner described above; then one, or sometimes all of them,\r\nsing:\r\n\r\n    I've built my house, I've built my wall;\r\n    I don't care where my chimneys fall!\r\n\r\nThe merriment consists in the bustle and confusion occasioned by the\r\nrapid withdrawal of the hands (Halliwell's _Nursery Rhymes_, p. 225).\r\nCompare Burne's _Shropshire Folk-lore_, p. 529.\r\n\r\nNorthall (_Folk Rhymes_, p. 418) gives the following rhymes as said in\r\nWarwickshire while the fists are being piled on one another:--\r\n\r\n    Here's one hammer on the block,\r\n    My men, my men;\r\n    There's one hammer, &c., my man John.\r\n    Dibble the can, blow bellows, blow,\r\n    Fire away, lads, for an hour or so.\r\n\r\nSee \"Dish-a-loof,\" \"Sacks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDumps\r\n\r\nA game at marbles or taw, played with holes scooped in the ground\r\n(Roxburgh, Jamieson). Grose gives _dump_ as signifying \"a deep hole of\r\nwater\" (_Provincial Glossary_).\r\n\r\n\r\nDust-point\r\n\r\nA game in which boys placed their points in a heap, and threw at them\r\nwith a stone. Weber and Nares give wrong explanations. It is alluded to\r\nin Cotton's Works, 1734, p. 184.\r\n\r\n    I'll venter on their heads my brindled cow,\r\n    With any boy at dust-point they shall play.\r\n\r\n--Peacham's _Thalia's Banquet_, 1620.\r\n\r\nNares (_Glossary_) suggests that this game and blow-point resembled the\r\ngame of Push-pin. See also Halliwell's _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEller Tree\r\n\r\nA number of young men and women stand in a line, a tall girl at one end\r\nof the line representing the tree. They then begin to wrap round her,\r\nsaying, \"The old eller tree grows thicker and thicker.\" When they have\r\nall got round her (the tree), they jump all together, calling out, \"A\r\nbunch of rags, a bunch of rags,\" and try to tread on each other's\r\ntoes.--Sheffield, Yorks (S. O. Addy).\r\n\r\n(_b_) The tree is the alder. It abounds in the North of England more\r\nthan in any other part of the kingdom, and seems always to have been\r\nthere held in great respect and veneration. Many superstitions also\r\nattach to the tree. It is possible from these circumstances that the\r\ngame descends from an old custom of encircling the tree as an act of\r\nworship, and the allusion to the \"rags\" bears at least a curious\r\nrelationship to tree worship. If this conclusion is correct, the\r\nparticular form of the game preserved by Mr. Addy may be the parent form\r\nof all games in which the act of winding is indicated. There is more\r\nreason for this when we consider how easy the notion of clock-winding\r\nwould creep in after the old veneration for the sacred alder tree had\r\nceased to exist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSee \"Bulliheisle,\" \"Wind up the Bush Faggot,\" \"Wind up the Watch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEzzeka\r\n\r\n    Old Ezzeka did one day stand\r\n    Upon a barrel top;\r\n    The bung flew out, and all at once\r\n    It went off with a pop.\r\n\r\n--Dronfield (S. O. Addy).\r\n\r\nThis game is usually played in a house or schoolroom, by boys and girls.\r\nA boy or girl is chosen who is considered to be able to stand a joke. He\r\nsits on a chair. A stool is put behind, upon which a boy called \"Ezzeka\"\r\nstands. Then the other boys and girls in the room sing the lines. As\r\nthey are finished, Ezzeka, who has a bottle of water in his hand, takes\r\nout the cork, and pours the water upon his victim's head. This game may\r\nbe compared with the game of \"King Arthur\" mentioned by Brand (_Pop.\r\nAntiq._, ii. 393).\r\n\r\n\r\nFather's Fiddle\r\n\r\nThis is a boys' game. One boy says to another, \"Divv (do) ye ken (know)\r\naboot my father's fiddle?\" On replying that he does not, the questioner\r\ntakes hold of the other's right hand with his left, and stretches out\r\nthe arm. With his right hand he touches the arm gently above the elbow,\r\nand says, \"My father had a fiddle, an' he brook (broke) it here, an' he\r\nbrook it here\" (touching it below the elbow), \"an' he brook it throw the\r\nmiddle,\" and comes down with a sharp stroke on the elbow-joint.--Keith,\r\nFochabers (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\nThis is probably the same game as that printed by Halliwell, No.\r\ncccxxxv., to which the following rhyme applied:--\r\n\r\n    My father was a Frenchman,\r\n      He bought for me a fiddle;\r\n    He cut me here, he cut me here,\r\n      He cut me right in the middle.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeed the Dove\r\n\r\nAn undescribed game mentioned in an old poem called _Christmas_ (i.\r\n285), quoted in Ellis's Brand, i. 517: \"Young men and maidens now at\r\n'Feed the Dove' (with laurel leaf in mouth) play.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFind the Ring\r\n\r\n    O the grand old Duke of York\r\n    He had ten thousand men,\r\n    He marched them up the hill ago\r\n    And he marched them down again.\r\n    And when they were up they were up,\r\n    And when they were down they were down,\r\n    And when they were half-way up the hill\r\n    They were neither up nor down.\r\n\r\n--Sheffield (S. O. Addy).\r\n\r\nA ring of chairs is formed, and the players sit on them. A piece of\r\nstring long enough to go round the inner circumference of the chairs is\r\nprocured. A small ring is put upon the string, the ends of which are\r\nthen tied. Then one of the players gets up from his chair and stands in\r\nthe centre. The players sitting on the chairs take the string into their\r\nhands and pass the ring round from one to another, singing the lines. If\r\nthe person standing in the centre can find out in whose hand the ring\r\nis, he sits down, and his place is taken by the one who had the ring.\r\nThe game is sometimes played round a haycock in the hayfield.\r\n\r\nMiss Dendy sends a similar rhyme from Monton, Lancashire, where it is\r\nknown simply as a marching game. For similar rhymes, see Halliwell's\r\n_Nursery Rhymes_, p. 3.\r\n\r\nSee \"Paddy from Home,\" \"Tip it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFippeny Morrell\r\n\r\n\"Twice three stones, set in a crossed square, where he wins the game\r\nthat can set his three along in a row, and that is fippeny morrell I\r\ntrow.\"--_Apollo Shroving_, 1626.\r\n\r\nSee \"Nine Men's Morice,\" \"Noughts and Crosses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFire, Air, and Water\r\n\r\nThe players seat themselves in a circle. One of the players has a ball,\r\nto which a string is fastened. He holds the string that he may easily\r\ndraw the ball back again after it is thrown. The possessor of the ball\r\nthen throws it to one in the circle, calling out the name of either of\r\nthe elements he pleases. This player must, before ten can be counted,\r\ngive the name of an inhabitant of that element. When \"Fire\" is called,\r\nstrict silence must be observed or a forfeit paid.--Cork, Ireland (Miss\r\nKeane).\r\n\r\nThe players were seated in a half-circle, and the possessor of the ball\r\nfaced the others. There was no string attached to the ball, but it was\r\nnecessary that it should hit the child it was thrown to. When \"Fire\" was\r\ncalled, \"Salamander\" and \"Ph[oe]nix\" were allowed to be said. The third\r\ntime \"Fire\" was called, silence was observed, and every player bowed the\r\nhead. We called it \"Earth, Air, Fire, and Water.\" A forfeit had to be\r\npaid for every mistake.--London (A. B. Gomme).\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that a survival of fire-worship is shown by this game.\r\n\r\n\r\nFivestones\r\n\r\nThis game was played by a newspaper boy at Richmond Station for me as\r\nfollows:--He had five square pieces of tile or stone about the size of\r\ndice. He took all five pieces in the palm of the hand first, then threw\r\nthem up and caught them on the back of the hand, and then from the back\r\nof the hand into the palm. Four of the stones were then thrown on the\r\nground; the fifth was thrown up, one stone being picked up from the\r\nground, and the descending fifth stone caught in the same hand; the\r\nother three pieces were next picked up in turn. Then two were picked up\r\ntogether in the same manner twice, then one, then three, then all four\r\nat once, the fifth stone being thrown up and caught with each movement.\r\nAll five were then thrown up and caught on the back of the hand, and\r\nthen thrown from the back and caught in the palm. When he dropped one,\r\nhe picked it up between his outstretched fingers while the other stones\r\nremained on the back of the hand; then he tossed and caught it likewise.\r\nThen after throwing up the five stones and catching them on the back of\r\nthe hand and the reverse, all five being kept in the palm, one was\r\nthrown up, and another deposited on the ground before the descending\r\nstone was caught. This was done to the three others in turn. Then with\r\ntwo at a time twice, then one and three, then all four together, then\r\nfrom the palm to the back of the hand, and again to the palm. This\r\ncompleted one game. If mistakes were made another player took the\r\nstones. Marks were taken for successful play. This boy called the game\r\n\"Dabs.\"--A. B. Gomme.\r\n\r\nIn South Notts this game was called \"Snobs.\" It was played with small\r\nstones or marbles. There were nine sets of tricks. First One-ers (of\r\nwhich there were five in the set), then Two-ers (two in set), Three-ers\r\n(three in set), Four-ers (four in set), Four Squares (four in set),\r\nTrotting Donkeys (eight in set, I believe), Fly-catchers (six or seven\r\nin set), Magic (five in set), and Magic Fly-catchers (five in set).\r\nOne-ers is played thus:--The five stones are thrown into the air and\r\ncaught on the back of the hand. If all are caught they are simply tossed\r\nup again and caught in the hollow of the hand, but if any are not caught\r\nthey have to be picked up, one by one, another stone being at the same\r\ntime thrown into the air and caught with the one picked up in the hand.\r\nTwo-ers, Three-ers, and Four-ers, are played in the same way, except\r\nthat the stones not caught on the back of the hand have to be arranged\r\nin twos, threes, and fours respectively by the hand on which the caught\r\nstones are lying meanwhile, and then each lot has to be picked up\r\naltogether. If the number that fall when the stones are first thrown up\r\nwon't allow of this, the player has to drop the required number (but no\r\nmore) from his hand. In Magic the play is just the same as in One-ers,\r\nexcept that instead of only throwing up a single stone and catching it\r\nas the others are in turn picked up, the whole number, except those\r\nremaining to be picked up, are thrown and caught. In Four Squares, four\r\nof the stones are arranged in a square, each of them is then picked up,\r\nwhilst the remaining stone is flung upwards and caught; the one picked\r\nup is then tossed up, and the one originally tossed up is put down in\r\nthe place of the other, which is caught as it descends, and the process\r\nrepeated \"all round the square.\" Trotting Donkeys is similarly played,\r\nexcept that the four stones are arranged in a line--not in a square--and\r\nI believe there is some other slight difference, but I forget what.\r\nFly-catchers is played like One-ers, except that the stone thrown into\r\nthe air while the others are being picked up, is not simply caught by\r\nbeing allowed to fall into the hand, but by an outward movement of the\r\nhand is _pounced on_, hawk-fashion, from above. Magic Fly-catchers is\r\nplayed in precisely the same way, except that as in simple Magic, not\r\none stone, but all are thrown up and caught--that is, if there are four\r\non the ground one only is thrown up for the first, two for the second,\r\nthree for the third, and so on until they are all picked up. This is, of\r\ncourse, the most difficult part of all, and, in fact, only experts were\r\nexpected to do it. Every failure means \"out,\" and then your opponent has\r\nhis turn. The winner is the one who gets through first. Such is the game\r\nas I remember it, but I have an uneasy suspicion that I have missed\r\nsomething out. I seem to remember one trick in which all the stones on\r\nthe ground had to be picked up at once _where they lay_--scrambled up so\r\nto speak. Or it may be (and, in fact, I think it was) that sometimes, to\r\nadd to the difficulty of the game, we picked up the groups of two,\r\nthree, and four in Two-ers, Three-ers, and Four-ers in this fashion,\r\ninstead of first placing them together.--Epworth, Doncaster (C. C.\r\nBell).\r\n\r\nIn Wakefield the set of pot checks, which represents five hucklebones,\r\nnow consists of four checks and a ball about the size of a large marble.\r\nThe checks are something like dice, but only two opposite sides are\r\nplain, the other four being fluted. The table played on is generally a\r\ndoorstep, and it is made ready by drawing a ring upon it with anything\r\nhandy which will make a mark. There are twelve figures or movements to\r\nbe gone through as follows. Some have special names, but I do not learn\r\nthat all have.\r\n\r\n1. The player, taking the checks and ball in the right hand, throws down\r\nthe checks, keeping the ball in the hand. If any check fall outside the\r\nring the player is \"down.\" There is skill needed in the throwing of the\r\nchecks in this and the following movements, so that they may be\r\nconveniently placed for taking up in the proper order. The checks being\r\nscattered, the player throws up the ball, takes up one check, and\r\ncatches the ball as it comes down, or, as it is sometimes played, after\r\nit has bounced once from the step. This is repeated till all the checks\r\nare taken up.\r\n\r\n2. As the last figure, but the checks are taken up two at a throw.\r\n\r\n3. As the last, but at the first throw one check, called the Horse, is\r\ntaken up, and at the second the remaining three checks at once, called\r\nthe Cart.\r\n\r\n4. As before, but all the checks taken up together.\r\n\r\n5. Called Ups and Downs. The checks are taken up at one throw, and set\r\ndown outside the ring at the next. This is done first with one, then\r\nwith two, and so on.\r\n\r\n6. Each check is touched in turn as the ball is thrown.\r\n\r\n7. The checks are separately pushed out of the ring.\r\n\r\n8. Each check in turn is taken up and knocked against the ground.\r\n\r\n9. Each check is taken up and tapped upon another.\r\n\r\n10. The checks are first arranged three in a line, touching each other,\r\nand the fourth placed at the top of that at one end of the row. This is\r\ncalled the Cradle. It has to be taken down check by check, and if, in\r\ntaking one, another is moved, the player is out.\r\n\r\n11. Like the last, but the checks are put one above another to make a\r\nChimney.\r\n\r\n12. Called the Dish-clout--I know not why, unless it be that it wipes\r\nup the game. The movement used in taking up the checks is thus\r\ndescribed:--\"Take hold of the sleeve of the right hand with the left;\r\nthrow up the ball, and twist your right hand underneath and over your\r\nleft, and catch the ball. With the hand still twisted throw up the ball\r\nand untwist and catch it.\" The checks are picked up in the course of the\r\ntwisting.\r\n\r\nThese I am told are the orthodox movements; and I do not doubt that in\r\nthem there is much of very old tradition, although the tenth and\r\neleventh must have been either added or modified since pot checks came\r\ninto use, for the figures could not be built up with the natural bones.\r\nSome other movements are sometimes used according to fancy, as for\r\nexample the clapping of the ground with the palm of the hand before\r\ntaking up the checks and catching the ball.--J. T. Micklethwaite (_Arch.\r\nJourn._, xlix. 327-28).\r\n\r\nI am told that in the iron districts of Staffordshire, the round bits of\r\niron punched out in making rivet holes in boiler plates are the modern\r\nrepresentatives of hucklebones.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\nIn Westminster four stones are held in the right hand, a marble is\r\nthrown up, and all four stones thrown down, and the marble allowed to\r\nbounce on the hearthstone or pavement, and then caught in the same hand\r\nafter it has rebounded. The marble is then thrown up again, and one of\r\nthe four stones picked up, and the marble caught again after it has\r\nrebounded. This is done separately to the other three, bringing all four\r\nstones into the hand. The marble is again bounced, and all four stones\r\nthrown down and the marble caught. Two stones are then picked up\r\ntogether, then the other two, then one, then three together, then all\r\nfour together, the marble being tossed and caught with each throw. An\r\narch is then formed by placing the left hand on the ground, and the four\r\nstones are again thrown down, the marble tossed, and the four stones\r\nput separately into the arch, the marble being caught after it has\r\nrebounded each time; or the four stones are separately put between the\r\nfingers of the left hand in as straight a row as possible. Then the left\r\nhand is taken away, and the four stones caught up in one sweep of the\r\nhand. Then all four stones are thrown down, and one is picked up before\r\nthe marble is caught. This is retained in the hand, and when the second\r\nstone is picked up the first one is laid down before the marble is\r\ncaught; the third is picked up and the second laid down, the fourth\r\npicked up and the third laid down, then the fourth laid down, the marble\r\nbeing tossed and caught again each time. The stones have different names\r\nor marks (which follow in rotation), and in picking them up they must be\r\ntaken in their proper order, or it is counted as a mistake. The game is\r\nplayed throughout by the right hand, the left hand only being used when\r\n\"arches\" is made. The marble should be thrown up about the same height\r\neach toss, and there should be little or no interval between the\r\ndifferent figures.--Annie Dicker.\r\n\r\nI saw this game played in Endell Street, London, W.C., by two girls.\r\nTheir game was not so long nor so complete as the above. They did not\r\nthrow all four stones down as a preliminary stage, but began with the\r\nsecond figure, the four gobs being placed in a square ::, nor were\r\nthey particular as to which stones they picked up. They knew nothing of\r\nnumbering or naming them. Their marble was called a \"jack.\" They had\r\nplaces chalked on the pavement where they recorded their successful\r\n\"goes,\" and the game was played in a ring.--A. B. Gomme.\r\n\r\nAn account sent me from Deptford (Miss Chase) is doubtless the same\r\ngame. It begins with taking two \"gobs\" at once, and apparently there are\r\neight stones or gobs to play with. The marble or round stone which is\r\nthrown up is called a \"tally.\" The directions for playing are--\r\n\r\n    We take twoses,\r\n    We take threeses,\r\n    We take fourses,\r\n    We take sixes,\r\n    We take eights.\r\n\r\nChain eggs--_i.e._, to pick up one and drop it again until this has been\r\ndone to each stone. Arches--_i.e._, gobs in a row. This was described by\r\nthe player as \"while the tally is up to sweep the whole row or line off\r\nthe ground into the arch of the finger and thumb before catching the\r\ntally.\"\r\n\r\n(_b_) These games are variants of one common original. It is the same\r\ngame as that described by F. H. Low in the _Strand Magazine_, ii. 514,\r\nas played in the London streets. The marble there is called a \"buck.\"\r\n\"Pegsy\" was the name of the No. 5 stage of the Wakefield version, and\r\nthis varies too, inasmuch as it was the same gob which is picked up and\r\nthen laid down before catching the buck.\r\n\r\nMr. Kinahan says, \"'Jackstones,' played with three or four small stones\r\nthat are thrown up in the air and caught again, seems to have been a\r\nvery ancient game, as the stones have been found in the _crannogs_ or\r\nlake-dwellings in some hole near the fireplaces, similar to where they\r\nare found in a cabin at the present day. An old woman, or other player,\r\nat the present time puts them in a place near the hob when they stop\r\ntheir game and go to do something else\" (_Folk-lore Journal_, ii. 266).\r\nIn the Græco-Roman saloon, British Museum, is a statue originally\r\ncomposed of two boys quarrelling at the game of \"Tali\" (see _Townley\r\nGallery_, i. 305; Smith's _Dict. Greek and Roman Antiq._, s.v. _Talus_),\r\nand it is interesting to note that in the Deptford game the marble is\r\ncalled a \"Tally.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kinahan's note suggests that \"Fivestones\" may be an independent\r\ngame, instead of a derivative from \"Hucklebones.\" If this is so, we have\r\ninteresting evidence of the spread or transmission of one game from at\r\nleast two centres. Professor Attwell, in _Notes and Queries_, 8th ser.,\r\niv. 201, suggests that \"Hucklebones\" was introduced into Europe by the\r\nRomans, and was spread throughout the countries which formed the empire\r\nby means of Roman colonists and soldiers. Mr. Newell (_Games_, pp.\r\n190-93) describes a similar game to \"Fivestones\" played in Boston under\r\nthe name of \"Otadama,\" or \"Japanese Jacks.\" This game is of Japanese\r\norigin, \"Tedama\" (that is, \"Handballs\") being its proper name. He says\r\nthere can be no doubt that the two forms of this amusement are branches\r\nof the same root; and we thus have an example of a game which, having\r\npreserved its essential characteristics for thousands of years, has\r\nfairly circumnavigated the globe, so that the two currents of tradition,\r\nwestward and eastward, from Europe and Asia, have met in America.\r\n\r\nSee \"Checkstones,\" \"Dibs,\" \"Hucklebones,\" \"Jackstones.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFlowers\r\n\r\nSides are chosen; each side must have a \"home\" at the top and bottom of\r\nthe ground where the children are playing. One side chooses a flower and\r\ngoes over to the other side, the members of which stand in a row facing\r\nthe first side. The first side states the initial letters of the flower\r\nit has chosen, and when the second side guesses the right flower they\r\nrun and try to catch as many of the opposite side as they can before\r\nthey reach their home. The captives then become members of the side\r\nwhich captured them.--Bitterne, Hants (Mrs. Byford).\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow my Gable\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Earls Heaton, Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Redhill, Surrey.\r\n\r\n    I.

Hope).\r\n\r\n    III.

Whatever he, or she, does, all in the ring must\r\nmimic, going round and singing at the same time. Any one found late in\r\nchanging the action or idle in obeying the caperings of the central\r\nchild becomes the 'Oary Man in place of the child taking that part. Both\r\ngirls and boys play. In the Redhill version, Holy Gabriel kneels in the\r\nmiddle of the circle. He acts as leader, and always had the fiddle as\r\nhis instrument, though he now usually plays the pianoforte as his first\r\ninstrument. The other children choose any instrument they like. Holy\r\nGabriel pretends to play the fiddle, and all the other children play\r\ntheir own instruments until Holy Gabriel changes his to one of theirs,\r\nwhen that one must immediately begin to play the fiddle, and continue\r\nuntil Holy Gabriel takes another instrument or returns to the fiddle.\r\nThis is done in vigorous pantomime. In the Luton variant the children\r\nsit in a semicircle, the Drummer faces them. He plays the drum; all the\r\nother children play on any other instrument they like. If the other\r\nplayers do not at once change their instrument, or neglect to sing the\r\nlines, a forfeit is demanded.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Mr. Hardy says some sing this game, \"Follow my game an holy man.\"\r\nMr. Hardy once thought it was the remnant of a goblin story of a hoary\r\nman of the gable or house-roof, who presided over the destinies of poor\r\ncottagers, and he had begun to make out the folk tale. The fairy would\r\nsometimes come down, and, playing his antics, compel whomsoever observed\r\nhim to follow him in a mimicking procession. Miss Hope writes of \"Holy\r\nGabriel\" that the game is played at Mead Vale, a small village in\r\nSurrey, but is unknown at larger villages and towns a few miles off.\r\nSome of the women who played it in their youth say that it began in the\r\nPrimitive Methodist school at Mead Vale. It is played at Outword, also a\r\nremote village, and was introduced there by a stonemason, who stated\r\nthat he had learned it from a cousin who had been in America. Further\r\ninquiry by Miss Hope elicited the fact that the cousin had learned the\r\ngame, when a boy, in his native place in Lancashire. He did not know\r\nwhether it was a well-known game there. This information points perhaps\r\nto a modern origin, but in such cases it must be borne in mind that\r\npeople are very fond of suggesting recent circumstances as the cause of\r\nthe most ancient traditions or customs. The obvious analogy to the\r\nincident in the myth of the Pied Piper, and to the Welsh custom at St.\r\nAlmedha Church, near Brecknock, recorded by Giraldus Cambrensis, where\r\nthe imitation of a frenzied leader is carried out as a religious\r\nceremony, rather suggests that in this game we may have a survival of a\r\nceremonial so common among early or uncultured people, the chief\r\nincident of which is the frenzied dancing of a god-possessed devotee.\r\n\r\n  [3] A variant of the second line is, \"Ranting, roaring, heely man.\" \"I\r\n      suppose he was Irish,\" said my informant, \"as he was named\r\n      'Healey'\" (Miss G. Hope).\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow my Leader\r\n\r\nThis is a boys' game. Any number can take part in it. It requires a good\r\nextent of country to play it well. The boy who is the swiftest runner\r\nand the best jumper is chosen as Leader. He sets out at a good speed\r\nover the fields, tries to jump as many ditches or burns, jumping such\r\nfrom one side to the other again and again, to scramble over dykes,\r\nthrough hedges, over palings, and run up braes. The others have to\r\nfollow him as they can. This steeplechase continues till the followers\r\nare all tired out.--Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\nThis is a very general game among schoolboys, but in Hereford it was a\r\ntown custom occurring once in seven years on 11th October (_Folk-lore\r\nJournal_, v. 75).\r\n\r\n\r\nFool, Fool, come to School\r\n\r\nThis game is played under the name of \"Foolie, Foolie\" at Duthil,\r\nStrathspey. The players are placed in a row, either standing or sitting.\r\nTwo are chosen, the one as Namer and the other as Foolie. Foolie\r\nwithdraws, if not out of sight, at least out of range of hearing. The\r\nNamer then gives a name secretly to each player. When this is done, he\r\ncalls on Foolie--Foolie, Foolie, come to your schoolie.\r\n\r\nFoolie pays no attention to this call. It is again repeated, but with\r\nthe same results. This goes on for several times. At last the Namer\r\ncalls out--\r\n\r\n    Foolie, Foolie, come to your schoolie;\r\n    Your bannocks are burnin' an' ready for turnin'.\r\n\r\nFoolie always obeys this call, comes and stations himself beside the\r\nNamer. A little chaffing generally goes on against Foolie. The Namer\r\nsays, \"Come chise me oot, come chise me in, tae\" so and so, naming one\r\nby the assumed fancy name. Foolie makes choice of one. If the choice\r\nfalls right, the one so chosen steps from the line and stands beside\r\nFoolie. If the choice falls wrong, the one named remains in the line.\r\nAll the players' names are called out in this way. If any stand unchosen\r\nby Foolie, the Namer then goes up to each and asks if he wants, _e.g._,\r\n\"an aipple,\" \"an orange,\" \"a kirk,\" \"a cottage,\" &c. Each one whispers\r\nwhat he wants. The same question is put to Foolie. If he answers,\r\n_e.g._, \"orange,\" the one so named steps out and stands beside Foolie.\r\nAll not first chosen are gone over in this way. Those left unchosen take\r\ntheir stand beside the Namer. There is then a tug-of-war, with the Namer\r\nand Foolie as the leaders.--Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\nIn Hants the children stand _vis-à-vis_, as in a country dance. One of\r\nthe number is sent out of earshot, and the others decide with the\r\nCaptain as to the name of the bird each wishes to personate. The\r\nCaptain then calls to the child who is out, \"Tom Fool, Tom Fool, come\r\nhome from school, and pick me out a blackbird,\" \"cuckoo,\" or other bird.\r\nIf Tom Fool is wrong in his guessing after three trials, he is condemned\r\nto run the gauntlet, being pelted with gloves or handkerchiefs not too\r\nmercifully.--Bitterne, Hants (Miss Byford).\r\n\r\nIn Sussex there is the same action with the following words, but there\r\nis no chasing or hitting--\r\n\r\n    Of all the birds in the air,\r\n    Of all the fishes in the sea,\r\n    You can pick me out [   ]\r\n\r\nIf the children fail to do so, they say--\r\n\r\n    Poor fool, been to school,\r\n    Learn more in a week;\r\n    Been there seven years\r\n    And hasn't learnt a bit.\r\n\r\n--Hurstmonceux, Sussex (Miss Chase).\r\n\r\nThe same game is played indoors in Cornwall, the reply being--\r\n\r\n    Fool, fool, go back to school\r\n    And learn your letters better.\r\n\r\n--Cornwall (_Folk-lore Journal_, v. 99-80).\r\n\r\nSee \"Namers and Guessers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFoot and Over\r\n\r\nOne boy out of a number stoops in the position for \"Leap-frog\" at an\r\nagreed fixed line. From the players he chooses a Leader and a Foot. The\r\nLeader first leaps over the stooping boy at a foot from the line; the\r\nother players then leap in turn each at a foot further from the line,\r\nthe stooping boy moving forward from the line for each player; finally\r\nthe Foot leaps as far as the distance leapt by the last boy. If this is\r\naccomplished, the Leader hops from the line and then leaps; the\r\nfollowers hop and leap each a foot further than each other; finally the\r\nFoot hops and leaps as far as the distance covered by the last boy. If\r\nthis is accomplished, the Leader hops twice and then leaps; the same\r\nprocess going on until one of the boys fails, who then takes the place\r\nof the stooping boy, and the game begins again. If the Foot covers any\r\nlonger distance than the Leader, the Leader stoops down.--Earls Heaton,\r\nYorks. (H. Hardy).\r\n\r\nThis game is general. Mr. Emslie describes the London version somewhat\r\ndifferently. After all the boys had jumped over the first boy's back, a\r\ncry of \"Foot it\" was raised, and the boy who had given the back placed\r\none of his feet at a right angle to the other, and in this way measured\r\na \"foot's length\" from the starting-place. All the boys then \"overed\"\r\nhis back from the original line, the last one crying \"Foot it,\" and then\r\nthe measuring ceremony was again gone through, and the game commenced\r\nagain, and continued in the same manner until one of the boys failed to\r\n\"over\" the back, when he became Back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1st position]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2nd position]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3rd position]\r\n\r\n\r\nFootball\r\n\r\nThe modern game of \"Football\" is too well known to need description\r\nhere, and, like \"Cricket,\" it has become no longer a children's game. As\r\nto its origin, there are many ball games, such as \"Camping,\" which have\r\nbeen suggested as the original form of \"Football.\" Every school almost\r\nhad some peculiarity in the method of playing, and Eton, Winchester,\r\nUppingham, and Rugby are well-known examples. It is not a little\r\ninteresting to note, now that \"Football\" has settled down into a\r\nnational game organised by county committees, that one of the forms of\r\nplay officially recognised is the old Rugby game, the other form, known\r\nas the \"Association,\" being arrived at by agreement of those interested\r\nin the game.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the ancient origin of the game, and its serious import as\r\na local contest rather than a sport, some examples may be given. It is\r\nstill (1877) keenly contested at Workington on Easter Tuesday on the\r\nbanks of, and not unfrequently in, the river Derwent (Dickinson's\r\n_Cumberland Glossary_). At Derby there was a football contest between\r\nthe parishes of All Saints' and St. Peter's. The ball was thrown into\r\nthe market-place from the Town Hall. The moment it was thrown the \"war\r\ncries\" of the rival parishes began, and the contest, nominally that of a\r\nfootball match, was in reality a fight between the two sections of the\r\ntown; and the victors were announced by the joyful ringing of their\r\nparish bells (Dyer's _Popular Customs_, p. 75). At Chester-le-Street the\r\ngame was played between what were termed \"up-streeters\" and\r\n\"down-streeters,\" one side endeavouring to get the ball to the top of\r\nthe town, whilst their opponents tried to keep it near the lower or\r\nnorth end. At one o'clock the ball was thrown out from near the old\r\ncommercial hotel, the Queen's Head, in the centre of the town, and it\r\nhas often been received by over three and four hundred people, so great\r\nwas the interest taken in this ancient sport. At Asborne the struggle\r\nwas between the \"up'ards\" and \"down'ards.\" At Dorking the divisions were\r\nbetween the east and west ends of the town, and there was first a\r\nperambulation of the streets by the football retinue composed of\r\ngrotesquely dressed persons. At Alnwick the divisions were the parishes\r\nof St. Michael's and St. Paul's. At Kirkwall the contest was on New\r\nYear's Day, and was between \"up the gates\" and \"down the gates,\" the\r\nball being thrown up at the Cross. At Scarborough, on the morning of\r\nShrove Tuesday, hawkers paraded the streets with parti-coloured balls,\r\nwhich were purchased by all ranks of the community. With these, and\r\narmed with sticks, men, women, and children repaired to the sands below\r\nthe old town and indiscriminately commenced a contest. The following\r\ngraphic account of Welsh customs was printed in the _Oswestry Observer_\r\nof March 2, 1887: \"In South Cardiganshire it seems that about eighty\r\nyears ago the population, rich and poor, male and female, of opposing\r\nparishes, turned out on Christmas Day and indulged in the game of\r\n'Football' with such vigour that it became little short of a serious\r\nfight. The parishioners of Cellan and Pencarreg were particularly bitter\r\nin their conflicts; men threw off their coats and waistcoats and women\r\ntheir gowns, and sometimes their petticoats. At Llanwenog, an extensive\r\nparish below Lampeter, the inhabitants for football purposes were\r\ndivided into the Bros and the Blaenaus. A man over eighty, an inmate of\r\nLampeter Workhouse, gives the following particulars:--In North Wales the\r\nball was called the Bêl Troed, and was made with a bladder covered with\r\na Cwd Tarw. In South Wales it was called Bél Ddu, and was usually made\r\nby the shoe-maker of the parish, who appeared on the ground on Christmas\r\nDay with the ball under his arm. The Bros, it should be stated, occupied\r\nthe high ground of the parish. They were nicknamed 'Paddy Bros,' from a\r\ntradition that they were descendants from Irish people who settled on\r\nthe hills in days long gone by. The Blaenaus occupied the lowlands, and,\r\nit may be presumed, were pure-bred Brythons. The more devout of the Bros\r\nand Blaenaus joined in the service at the parish church on Christmas\r\nmorning. At any rate, the match did not begin until about mid-day, when\r\nthe service was finished. Then the whole of the Bros and Blaenaus, rich\r\nand poor, male and female, assembled on the turnpike road which divided\r\nthe highlands from the lowlands. The ball having been redeemed from the\r\nCrydd, it was thrown high in the air by a strong man, and when it fell\r\nBros and Blaenaus scrambled for its possession, and a quarter of an hour\r\nfrequently elapsed before the ball was got out from among the struggling\r\nheap of human beings. Then if the Bros, by hook or by crook, could\r\nsucceed in taking the ball up the mountain to their hamlet of Rhyddlan\r\nthey won the day; while the Blaenaus were successful if they got the\r\nball to their end of the parish at New Court. The whole parish was the\r\nfield of operations, and sometimes it would be dark before either party\r\nscored a victory. In the meantime many kicks would be given and taken,\r\nso that on the following day some of the competitors would be unable to\r\nwalk, and sometimes a kick on the shins would lead the two men\r\nconcerned to abandon the game until they had decided which was the\r\nbetter pugilist. There do not appear to have been any rules for the\r\nregulation of the game; and the art of football playing in the olden\r\ntime seems to have been to reach the goal. When once the goal was\r\nreached, the victory was celebrated by loud hurrahs and the firing of\r\nguns, and was not disturbed until the following Christmas Day. Victory\r\non Christmas Day, added the old man, was so highly esteemed by the whole\r\ncountryside, that a Bro or Blaenau would as soon lose a cow from his\r\ncow-house as the football from his portion of the parish.\"\r\n\r\n(_b_) In Gomme's _Village Community_, pp. 241-44, the position of\r\nfootball games as elements in the traditions of race is discussed, and\r\ntheir relationship to a still earlier form of tribal games, where the\r\nelement of clan feuds is more decidedly preserved, is pointed out.\r\n\r\n\r\nForfeits\r\n\r\nForfeits are incurred in those games in which penalties are exacted from\r\nplayers for non-compliance with the rules of the game; \"Buff,\"\r\n\"Contrary,\" \"Crosspurposes,\" \"Fire, Air, and Water,\" \"Follow my Gable,\"\r\n\"Genteel Lady,\" \"Jack's Alive,\" \"Old Soldier,\" \"Twelve Days of\r\nChristmas,\" \"Turn the Trencher,\" \"Wadds,\" and others. These games are\r\ndescribed under their several titles, and the formula for forfeits is\r\nalways the same. Small articles belonging to the players must be given\r\nby them every time a forfeit is incurred, and these must be redeemed at\r\nthe close of the game. They are \"cried\" in the following manner:--One of\r\nthe players sits on a chair having the forfeits in her lap. A child\r\nkneels on the ground and buries his face in his hands on the lap of the\r\nperson who holds the forfeits. The \"crier\" then takes up\r\nindiscriminately one of the forfeits, and holding it up in the sight of\r\nall those who have been playing the games (without the kneeling child\r\nseeing it), says--\r\n\r\n    Here's a very pretty thing and a very pretty thing,\r\n    And what shall be done to [_or_, by] the owner of this very pretty\r\n      thing?\r\n\r\nThe kneeling child then says what the penance is to be. The owner of the\r\nforfeit must then perform the penance before the other players, and then\r\nanother forfeit is \"cried.\"\r\n\r\nThe more general penances imposed upon the owners of the forfeits are as\r\nfollows, but the list could be very much extended:--\r\n\r\n    Bite an inch off the poker.\r\n    Kneel to the prettiest, bow to the wittiest, and kiss the one you\r\n      love best.\r\n    Stand in each corner of the room, sigh in one, cry in another, sing\r\n      in another, and dance in the other.\r\n    Put yourself through the keyhole.\r\n    Place two chairs in the middle of the room, take off your shoes, and\r\n      jump over them.\r\n    Measure so many yards of love ribbon.\r\n    Postman's knock.\r\n    Crawl up the chimney.\r\n    Spell Opportunity.\r\n\r\nMiss Burne mentions one penance designed to make the victim ridiculous,\r\nas when he is made to lie on his back on the floor with his arms\r\nextended, and declare--\r\n\r\n    Here I lie!\r\n    The length of a looby,\r\n    The breadth of a booby,\r\n    And three parts of a jackass!\r\n\r\n--_Shropshire Folk-lore_, pp. 526-27.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Halliwell gives, in his _Nursery Rhymes_, pp. 324-26, some curious\r\nverses, recorded for the first time by Dr. Kenrick in his Review of Dr.\r\nJohnson's Shakespeare, 1765, on \"rules for seemly behaviour,\" in which\r\nthe forfeits imposed by barbers as penalties for handling razors, &c,\r\nare set forth. Although \"barbers' forfeits\" are not of the same nature\r\nas the nursery forfeits, it is possible that this general custom among\r\nso important a class of the community in early times as barbers may have\r\nsuggested the game. Both Forby in his _Vocabulary of East Anglia_ and\r\nMoor in his _Suffolk Words_ bear testimony to the general prevalence of\r\nbarbers' forfeits, and it must be borne in mind that barbers were also\r\nsurgeons in early days. A curious custom is also recorded in another\r\nEast Anglian word-list, which may throw light upon the origin of the\r\ngame from popular custom. \"A forfeit is incurred by using the word\r\n'water' in a brew-house, where you must say 'liquor;' or by using the\r\nword 'grease' in a chandlery, where it is 'stuff' or 'metal.' The\r\nforfeit is to propitiate the offended _genius loci_\" (Spurden's _East\r\nAnglian Vocabulary_). The element of divination in the custom is perhaps\r\nindicated by a curious note from Waldron, in his _Description of the\r\nIsle of Man_ (_Works_, p. 55), \"There is not a barn unoccupied the whole\r\ntwelve days, every parish hiring fiddlers at the public charge. On\r\nTwelfth Day the fiddler lays his head on some of the wenches' laps, and\r\na third person asks who such a maid or such a maid shall marry, naming\r\nthe girls then present one after another; to which he answers according\r\nto his own whim, or agreeable to the intimacies he has taken notice of\r\nduring this time of merriment. But whatever he says is as absolutely\r\ndepended on as an oracle; and if he happen to couple two people who have\r\nan aversion to each other, tears and vexation succeed the mirth. This\r\nthey call cutting off the fiddler's head; for after this he is dead for\r\nthe whole year.\" Redeeming the forfeits is called \"Crying the Weds,\" in\r\nBurne's _Shropshire Folk-lore_, p. 526. See \"Wadds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFox\r\n\r\n    Fox, a fox, a brummalary\r\n    How many miles to Lummaflary? Lummabary?\r\n    Eight and eight and a hundred and eight.\r\n    How shall I get home to-night?\r\n    Spin your legs and run fast.\r\n\r\nHalliwell gives this rhyme as No. ccclvii. of his _Nursery Rhymes_, but\r\nwithout any description of the game beyond the words, \"A game of the\r\nfox.\" It is probably the same game as \"Fox and Goose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFox and Goose (1)\r\n\r\nIn Dorsetshire one of the party, called the Fox, takes one end of the\r\nroom or corner of a field (for the game was equally played indoors or\r\nout); all the rest of the children arrange themselves in a line or\r\nstring, according to size, one behind the other, the smallest last,\r\nbehind the tallest one, called Mother Goose, with their arms securely\r\nround the waist of the one in front of them, or sometimes by grasping\r\nthe dress.\r\n\r\nThe game commences by a parley between the Fox and Goose to this effect,\r\nthe Goose beginning.\r\n\r\n\"What are you after this fine morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Taking a walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"With what object?\"\r\n\r\n\"To get an appetite for a meal.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does [will] your meal consist of?\"\r\n\r\n\"A nice fat goose for my breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where will you get it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I shall get a nice morsel somewhere; and as they are so handy, I\r\nshall satisfy myself with one of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Catch one if you can.\"\r\n\r\nA lively scene follows. The Fox and Mother Goose should be pretty evenly\r\nmatched; the Mother with extended arms seeking to protect her Brood,\r\nwhile the Fox, who tries to dodge under, right and left, is only allowed\r\nin case of a successful foray or grasp to secure the last of the train.\r\nVigorous efforts are made to escape him, the Brood of course\r\nsupplementing the Mother's exertions to elude him as far as they are\r\nable, but without breaking the link. The game may be continued until all\r\nin turn are caught.--_Folk-lore Journal_, vii. 217-18.\r\n\r\nIn Lancashire the children stand in line behind each other, holding each\r\nother by the waist. One stands facing them and calls out--\r\n\r\n    My mother sits on yonder chimney,\r\n    And she says she _must_ have a chicken.\r\n\r\nThe others answer--\r\n\r\n    She _can't_ have a chicken.\r\n\r\nThe one then endeavours to catch the last child of the tail, who when\r\ncaught comes behind the captor; repeat until all have changed\r\nsides.--Monton, Lancashire (Miss Dendy).\r\n\r\nA version of this game played at Eckington, Derbyshire, is played as\r\nfollows:--A den is chalked out or marked out for the Fox. A larger den,\r\nopposite to this, is marked out for the Geese. A boy or a girl\r\nrepresents the Fox, and a number of others the Geese. Then the Fox\r\nshouts, \"Geese, Geese, gannio,\" and the Geese answer, \"Fox, Fox,\r\nfannio.\" Then the Fox says, \"How many Geese have you to-day?\" The Geese\r\nreply, \"More than you can catch and carry away.\" Then the Geese run out\r\nof the den, and the Fox tries to catch them. He puts as many as he\r\ncatches into his den (S. O. Addy).\r\n\r\n(_b_) This game is a very general one at Christmas time. It is\r\npractically the same as \"Gled Wylie,\" and \"Hen and Chickens,\" and the\r\n\"Hawk and Chickens\" of Mr. Newell's _Games and Songs of American\r\nChildren_, pp. 155-56. By referring to these games it will be seen that\r\nthe whole group are mimic representatives of farmyard episodes, though\r\nthe animal characters are giving way to more domestic affairs, as shown\r\nin the Pins and Needles version of \"Hen and Chickens.\" It is possible\r\nthat the different animals which are victims to the Fox appearing in the\r\ndifferent games may arise from local circumstances, and that in this\r\ncase a real distinction exists between the various names by which this\r\ngame is known. A game called \"Wolf and Deer,\" similar to \"Fox and\r\nGeese,\" is given in _Winter Evening Amusements_, by R. Revel. The last\r\none at the end of the tail may, if she has no other chance of escape,\r\ntry and place herself before the Deer or Hen. She is then no longer to\r\nbe hunted; all the others must then follow her example until the deer\r\nbecomes the last of the line. The game then terminates by exacting a\r\nforfeit for each lady whom the Wolf has suffered to escape his clutches\r\n(pp. 64, 65).\r\n\r\nSee \"Gled Wylie,\" \"Hen and Chickens,\" \"Old Dame.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFox and Geese (2)\r\n\r\nA game known by this name is played with marbles or pegs on a board on\r\nwhich are thirty-three holes, or on the pavement, with holes scraped out\r\nof the stones. To play this game there are seventeen pieces called\r\nGeese, and another one either larger or distinguished from the Geese by\r\nits colour, which is called the Fox. The Fox occupies the centre hole,\r\nand the Geese occupy nine holes in front, and four on each side of him.\r\nThe vacant holes behind are for the Geese and Fox to move in. The game\r\nis for the Geese to shut up the Fox so that he cannot move. All the\r\npieces can be moved from one spot to another in the direction of the\r\nlines, but cannot pass over two holes at once. The Geese are not\r\npermitted to take the Fox. The Fox's business is to take all, or as many\r\nof the Geese as will prevent him from being blockaded. The Fox can take\r\nthe Geese whenever there is a vacant space behind them, which he passes\r\nto, then occupies.\r\n\r\nThis game has been very popular among schoolboys in all ages. Mr.\r\nMicklethwaite, in a paper on the Indoor Games of School Boys in the\r\nMiddle Ages (_Arch. Journ._ xlix. 322), gives instances of finding\r\nfigures of this game cut \"in the cloister benches of Gloucester\r\nCathedral and elsewhere, and there are several on the twelfth century\r\ntomb at Salisbury, miscalled Lord Stourton's,\" and also at Norwich\r\nCastle. For the date of these boards, Mr. Micklethwaite says for the\r\nlast three centuries and a half cloisters everywhere in England have\r\nbeen open passages, and there have generally been schoolboys about. It\r\nis therefore not unlikely that they should have left behind them such\r\ntraces as these play-boards. But if they are of later date they would\r\nnot be found to be distributed in monastic cloisters with respect to the\r\nmonastic arrangement, and we do find them so. Strutt describes the game\r\n(_Sports_, p. 319).\r\n\r\nSee \"Nine Men's Morris,\" \"Noughts and Crosses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFox in the Fold\r\n\r\n\"The Tod (Fox) i' the Faul (Fold).\" This game is commonly played by\r\nboys. Any number of boys join hands and stand in a circle to form the\r\nFaul. The boy that represents the Tod is placed within the circle. His\r\naim is to escape. To effect this he rushes with all his force, increased\r\nby a run, against the joint hands of any two of the players. If the rush\r\ndoes not unloose the grasp, he hangs on the two arms with all his\r\nweight, pressing and wriggling. If he fails he makes a rush at another\r\ntwo, always selecting those players he thinks weakest. When he does\r\nbreak through he rushes off at the top of his speed, with all the\r\nplayers in full cry, till he is caught and brought back. The game\r\nbegins anew with another boy as Tod.--Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\nSee \"Bull in the Park,\" \"Frog in the Middle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFox in the Hole\r\n\r\nAll the players are armed with handkerchiefs. One of the players is\r\nchosen for Fox, who has his den marked out. The Fox hops out on one leg,\r\nwith his handkerchief ready to strike. The players gather round him and\r\nattack him. If he can strike one of his assailants without putting his\r\nfoot to the ground from his hopping position, the player so struck is\r\nchased by the others into the den, and he then becomes the Fox for\r\nanother round of the game.--Cork (Miss Keane).\r\n\r\nHalliwell (_Nursery Rhymes_, p. 228) describes the game in practically\r\nthe same manner, but adds that when the Fox is coming out he says--\r\n\r\n    The Fox gives warning\r\n    It's a cold and frosty morning,\r\n\r\nafter which he is at liberty to hop out and use his handkerchief.\r\n\r\n_(b)_ This game is alluded to in _Soliman and Perseda_, 1599; _Florio_,\r\np. 480; _Herrick_, i. 176. See Halliwell's _Dictionary_. Professor Mayor\r\ncommunicated to the _Gentleman's Magazine_ of 1848 (ii.), p. 147, the\r\nfollowing early allusions to the game from old dictionaries:--\r\n\r\nGouldman, London, MDCLXIV.--\"_Ascoliasmus_, Empusæ ludus: a kind of play\r\nwherein boys lift up one leg and hop with the other, where they beat one\r\nanother with bladders tied to the end of strings. Fox to thy hole.\"\r\n\r\nHolyoke, MDCLXXVII.--\"_Empusa_. [Greek: para to heni podizein], quòd uno\r\nincedat pede. Hence _empusam agere_ is used for a play, hopping on one\r\nleg; with us, Fox to his hole.\"\r\n\r\nId. \"_Ascoliasmus._ A kind of play that children use when they hop on\r\none leg, called Fox to thy hole.\"\r\n\r\nCambridge Dict. MDCXCIII.--\"_Ascol._ A kind of play wherein boys hopping\r\non one leg beat one another with gloves or pieces of leather, and is\r\ncalled Fox to thy hole.\"\r\n\r\nColes, 7th ed. 1711.--\"_Ascol._ The play called Fox to the\r\nhole.--_Empus._ Ludus Empusæ. Scotch hoppers, or Fox in the hole.\"\r\n\r\nA similar game to this is played at Earls Heaton, Yorkshire (Mr. Hardy),\r\nand called \"Goose and Gander.\" Two players, the Goose and the Gander,\r\nstand in a ring, each on one leg. They hop out in turn, and try to catch\r\none of the other players without letting their other leg touch the\r\nground. If they fail in this they get \"strapped\" back to the ring. When\r\neither are successful, the player who is caught takes the place of\r\neither Goose or Gander in turn. The game is also mentioned in _Useful\r\nTransactions in Philosophy_, 1708-9.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrench Jackie\r\n\r\nThis game is played either by boys or girls or by both together. One is\r\nchosen to stand alone; the other players join hands and form a circle.\r\nThe one outside the circle goes round it and touches on the back one of\r\nthe circle. He then runs off round the circle, and the one who was\r\ntouched runs off in the opposite direction round the circle. The aim of\r\neach player is to reach the vacant place in the circle first. The one\r\nleft out has to repeat the same action. The game may go on for any\r\nlength of time.--Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\nAt Barnes this game is called \"Gap.\" It is known as \"French Tag\" in the\r\nForest of Dean, Gloucestershire (Miss Matthews), and \"Tap-back\" at\r\nBitterne, Hants (Mrs. Adam).\r\n\r\n\r\nFrench and English\r\n\r\nThe children choose sides under a leader, and a boundary line is made in\r\nthe middle of the ground dividing the French and English territory. A\r\nhandkerchief is then placed in the back part of each territory to\r\nrepresent a flag. The object is to obtain as many flags from the\r\nopposite side as possible. If a person is captured before having seized\r\na flag, he is taken prisoner, and must be rescued by one of his own\r\nside. Thus, for instance, an Englishman enters the French territory and\r\ntries to reach the flag. If he is seen by the French before he reaches\r\nthe flag, he is taken prisoner and is placed near the flags, and the\r\nnext Englishman rescues him instead of taking a flag. As soon as the\r\nflag is taken, one of the party must put another handkerchief in its\r\nplace. A player cannot be taken prisoner after having obtained the\r\nhandkerchief or flag. The winning side is decided by counting the flags\r\nand prisoners.--Bitterne, Hants (Mrs. Byford).\r\n\r\nThis is a very general game, and is known as \"Scotch and English\" in the\r\nnorth, where some interesting details occur, for which see \"Scotch and\r\nEnglish.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrench Blindman's Buff\r\n\r\nThe children kneel in a circle, one standing blindfolded in the middle.\r\nThe kneeling children shout, \"Come point to me with your\r\npointer.\"--Monton, Lancashire (Miss Dendy).\r\n\r\nSee \"Buff,\" \"Dinah,\" \"Muffin Man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFriar-rush\r\n\r\nA Christmas game, mentioned in the _Declaration of Popish Impostures_,\r\n1603.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrincy-francy\r\n\r\nA game played between the dances at balls in farm-houses. A chair was\r\nplaced in the middle of the barn or room; the master of the ceremonies\r\nled to the chair a young woman, who sat down and named the young man\r\nwhom she was willing should kiss her. This he did, and then took the\r\nseat which the lady vacated. He then called out the name of some\r\nfavourite girl, who was led up to him; there was another kiss. The girl\r\nthen took the seat, and so on (county of Down). The same game is called\r\n\"Frimsey-framsey\" in parts of the county of Antrim.--Patterson's _Antrim\r\nand Down Glossary_.\r\n\r\nCompare \"Cushion Dance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrog-lope\r\n\r\nName for \"Leap-frog.\"--Addy's _Sheffield Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrog in the Middle\r\n\r\nOne child is seated on the ground with his legs under him; the other\r\nplayers form a ring round. They then pull or buffet the centre child or\r\nFrog, who tries to catch one of them without rising from the floor. The\r\nchild who is caught takes the place of the centre child. Another method\r\nof playing the game is similar to \"Bull in the Park.\" The child in the\r\ncentre tries to break out of the ring, those forming it keeping the Frog\r\nin the ring by any means in their power, while still keeping their hands\r\nclasped. They sometimes sing or say--\r\n\r\n    Hey! hey! hi! Frog in the middle and there shall lie;\r\n    He can't get out and he shan't get out--hey! hey! hi!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey dance round when saying this, all keeping a watch on the Frog, who\r\nsuddenly makes a rush, and tries to break through the ring.--London (A.\r\nB. Gomme).\r\n\r\nStrutt describes this game, and gives an illustration from a fourteenth\r\ncentury MS. which is here reproduced from the original (_Sports_, p.\r\n303). Newell (_Games of American Children_, p. 171) also mentions it,\r\nand gives the rhyme as--\r\n\r\n    Frog in the sea, can't catch me!\r\n\r\n\r\nGap\r\n\r\nThe same as \"French Jackie.\" This game is called \"Tap-back\" or\r\n\"Tat-back\" at Bitterne, Hants.\r\n\r\n\r\nGarden Gate\r\n\r\nChildren join hands and form a ring. One child stands inside the ring;\r\nthis child walks round and asks one of the circle, called the Keeper--\r\n\r\n    Have you the key of the garden gate?\r\n    Open and let me go through.\r\n\r\nThe Keeper replies--\r\n\r\n    My next-door neighbour's got the key;\r\n    Ask him and he'll give it to you.\r\n\r\nThis is repeated by each one in the circle. Then the inside child comes\r\nagain to the Keeper and says--\r\n\r\n    None of the neighbours have got the key,\r\n    So you must let me go through.\r\n\r\nThe Keeper answers--\r\n\r\n    I've lost the key of the garden gate,\r\n    And cannot let you through.\r\n\r\nThen all the ring say--\r\n\r\n    You must stop all night within the gate,\r\n    Unless you have strength to break through.\r\n\r\nThe child inside then attempts to break through, and if he succeeds in\r\nbreaking any of the clasped hands the one who first gives way has to\r\ntake the place in the centre.--Roxton, St. Neots (Miss Lumley).\r\n\r\nSee \"Bull in the Park.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGegg\r\n\r\n\"To smuggle the Gegg,\" a game played by boys in Glasgow, in which two\r\nparties are formed by lot, equal in number, the one being denominated\r\nthe Outs, the other Ins. The Outs are those who go out from the den or\r\ngoal, where those called the Ins remain for a time. The Outs get the\r\nGegg, which is anything deposited, as a key, a penknife, &c. Having\r\nreceived this, they conceal themselves, and raise the cry, \"Smugglers!\"\r\nOn this they are pursued by the Ins; and if the Gegg (for the name is\r\ntransferred to the person who holds the deposit) be taken, they exchange\r\nsituations--the Outs become Ins and the Ins Outs. This play is\r\ndistinguished from \"Hy-spy\" only by the use of the Gegg. One of the Ins\r\nwho is touched by one of the Outs is said to be taken, and henceforth\r\nloses his right to hold the Gegg. If he who holds the Gegg gets in the\r\nden, the Outs are winners, and have the privilege of getting out again.\r\nThe Outs, before leaving the den, shuffle the Gegg, or smuggle it so\r\nbetween each other that the Ins do not know which person has it. He who\r\nis laid hold of, and put to the question, is supposed to deny that he\r\nhas the Gegg: if he escapes with it, he gets out again.--Jamieson.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenteel Lady\r\n\r\nA player begins thus:--\"I, a genteel lady (or gentleman) came from that\r\ngenteel lady (or gentleman) to say that she (or he) owned a tree.\" The\r\nother players repeat the words in turn, and then the leader goes over\r\nthem again, adding, \"with bronze bark.\" The sentence goes round once\r\nmore, and on the next repetition the leader continues, \"with golden\r\nbranches.\" He afterwards adds, \"and silver leaves,\" \"and purple fruit,\"\r\n\"and on the top a milk-white dove,\" and, finally, \"mourning for the loss\r\nof his lady-love.\"\r\n\r\nIf a player should fail in repeating the rigmarole, there is a fine to\r\npay. A \"pipe-lighter\" is stuck in her hair, and she must say \"one-horned\r\nlady\" instead of \"genteel lady.\" When a second horn is added, of course\r\nshe says \"two-horned,\" and so forth. Some players wear half-a-dozen\r\nbefore the conclusion of the game. The game is called \"The Wonderful\r\nTree.\"--Anderby, Lincolnshire (Miss M. Peacock).\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Yorkshire it is customary to say \"no-horned lady\"\r\ninstead of \"genteel lady\" at the beginning of the game.\r\n\r\nWhen we played this game we said \"always genteel\" after \"genteel lady,\"\r\nand varied the formula. For instance, the first player would say, \"I, a\r\ngenteel lady, always genteel, come from a genteel lady, always genteel,\r\nto say she lives in a house with twelve windows,\" or words were used\r\nbeginning with the letter A. Each player must repeat this, and add\r\nsomething else in keeping with a house; or sentences had to be made in\r\nwhich words beginning with the letter A must be said, the other players\r\ndoing the same alphabetically.--London (A. B. Gomme).\r\n\r\nMr. Newell, in writing of this game, says that the \"lamp-lighter\" or\r\n\"spill\" was lighted when placed in the hair of the players who made\r\nmistakes. He does not mention forfeits being exacted.--_Games_, p. 139.\r\n\r\n\r\nGhost at the Well\r\n\r\nOne of the party is chosen for Ghost (if dressed in white so much the\r\nbetter); she hides in a corner; the other children are a mother and\r\ndaughters. The eldest daughter says:--\r\n\r\n\"Mother, mother, please give me a piece of bread and butter.\"\r\n\r\nM. \"Let me (or 'leave me') look at your hands, child. Why, they are very\r\ndirty.\"\r\n\r\nE. D. \"I will go to the well and wash them.\"\r\n\r\nShe goes to the corner, the Ghost peeps up, and she rushes back, crying\r\nout--\r\n\r\n\"Mother! mother! I have seen a Ghost.\"\r\n\r\nM. \"Nonsense, child! it was only your father's nightshirt I have washed\r\nand hung out to dry. Go again.\"\r\n\r\nThe child goes, and the same thing happens. She returns, saying--\r\n\r\n\"Yes! mother! I have seen a ghost.\"\r\n\r\nM. \"Nonsense, child! we will take a candle, and all go together to\r\nsearch for it.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother picks up a twig for a candle, and they set off. When they\r\ncome near to the Ghost, she appears from her hiding-place, mother and\r\nchildren rush away in different directions, the Ghost chases them until\r\nshe has caught one, who in her turn becomes Ghost.--West Cornwall (Miss\r\nCourtney, _Folk-lore Journal_, v. 55).\r\n\r\nThis game was \"Ghost in the Copper\" in London. It was played in the same\r\nway as above. Chairs formed the copper, and the ghost crouched down\r\nbehind. The \"Mother\" was \"washing\" at a tub, also formed with two\r\nchairs. The eldest daughter was told she could not go to school to-day;\r\nshe must stop at home and help hang up the clothes. The other children\r\ngo to play. The Mother said, \"Here, Jane, take this (pretending to give\r\nher a garment out of the wash-tub) and put it in the copper, and push it\r\ndown well with the stick.\" Jane goes to the copper and pretends to take\r\noff the lid. When she puts the washed garment in, and pokes down with\r\nthe stick, the Ghost jumps up. She cries out as above, the Mother\r\nsaying, \"Nonsense, child! it's only some of the boiling clothes.\" The\r\nchild goes again, and the game proceeds as above. It is generally played\r\nnow as \"Ghost.\"--A. B. Gomme. It is mentioned by Newell (_Games_, p.\r\n223).\r\n\r\n\r\nGiants\r\n\r\nA Giant is chosen, and he must be provided with a cave. A summer-house\r\nwill do, if there is no window for the Giant to see out of. The others\r\nthen have to knock at the door with their knuckles separately. The Giant\r\nrushes when he thinks all the children have knocked, and if he succeeds\r\nin catching one before they reach a place of safety (appointed\r\nbeforehand) the captured one becomes Giant.--Bitterne, Hants (Mrs.\r\nByford). See \"Wolf.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGiddy\r\n\r\n    Giddy, giddy, gander,\r\n    Who stands yonder?\r\n    Little Bessy Baker,\r\n    Pick her up and shake her;\r\n    Give her a bit of bread and cheese,\r\n    And throw her over the water.\r\n\r\n--Warwickshire.\r\n\r\n_(b)_ A girl being blindfolded, her companions join hands and form a\r\nring round her. At the word \"Yonder\" the blindfolded girl points in any\r\ndirection she pleases, and at line three names one of the girls. If the\r\none pointed at and the one named be the same, she is the next to be\r\nblinded; but, curiously enough, if they be not the same, the one named\r\nis the one. Meanwhile, at line four, she is not \"picked up,\" but is\r\nshaken by the shoulders by the still blindfolded girl; and at line five\r\nshe is given by the same \"bread and cheese,\" _i.e._, the buds or young\r\nleaves of what later is called \"May\" (_Cratægus oxyacantha_); and at\r\nline six she is taken up under the blinded girl's arm and swung\r\nround.--Warwickshire (_Notes and Queries_, 6th Ser., viii. 451).\r\n\r\n\r\nGilty-galty (or gaulty)\r\n\r\nA boy's game. One boy is chosen, who says:--\r\n\r\n    Gilty-galty four-and-forty,\r\n    Two tens make twenty.\r\n\r\nHe then counts one, two, three, four, &c., up to forty, having his eyes\r\ncovered by his hands, and the others hide while he is saying the\r\n\"nominy.\" At the conclusion he uncovers his eyes, and if he sees any\r\nboys not yet hidden they have to stand still. He seeks the rest, but if\r\nhe moves far away from his place, called the \"stooil\" (stool), one of\r\nthe hidden boys may rush out and take it, provided he can get there\r\nfirst. Should he fail in this he also has to stand aside; but if any one\r\nsucceeds, then all run out as before, and the same boy has to say the\r\n\"nominy\" again. On the other hand, if he finds all the boys without\r\nloosing his \"stooil,\" the boy first caught has to take his place and say\r\nthe \"nominy.\" The game was thus played in 1810, and is so still, both\r\nhere and at Lepton.--Easther's _Almondbury and Huddersfield Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGipsy\r\n\r\n    I charge my children, every one,\r\n    To keep good house while I am gone.\r\n    You, and you [points], but specially you\r\n          [or sometimes, but specially Sue],\r\n    Or else I'll beat you black and blue.\r\n\r\nOne child is selected for Gipsy, one for Mother, and one for Daughter\r\nSue. The Mother says the lines, and points to several children to\r\nemphasise her words. During her absence the Gipsy comes in, entices a\r\nchild away, and hides her.

One of the\r\nlargest of the boys steals away from his comrades, in an angry-like\r\nmood, to some dykeside or sequestered nook, and there begins to work as\r\nif putting a pot on a fire. The others seem alarmed at his manner, and\r\ngather round him, when the following dialogue takes place:--\r\n\r\nThey say first to him--\r\n\r\n    What are ye for wi' the pot, gudeman?\r\n      Say what are ye for wi' the pot?\r\n    We dinna like to see ye, gudeman,\r\n      Sae thrang about this spot.\r\n\r\n    We dinna like ye ava, gudeman,\r\n      We dinna like ye ava.\r\n    Are ye gaun to grow a gled, gudeman?\r\n      And our necks draw and thraw?\r\n\r\nHe answers--\r\n\r\n    Your minnie, burdies, ye maun lae;\r\n    Ten to my nocket I maun hae;\r\n    Ten to my e'enshanks, and or I gae lye,\r\n    In my wame I'll lay twa dizzen o' ye by.\r\n\r\nThe mother of them, as it were, returns--\r\n\r\n    Try't than, try't than, do what ye can,\r\n    Maybe ye maun toomer sleep the night, gudeman;\r\n    Try't than, try't than, Gled-wylie frae the heugh,\r\n    Am no sae saft, Gled-wylie, ye'll fin' me bauld and teugh.\r\n\r\nAfter these rhymes are said the chickens cling to the mother all in\r\na string. She fronts the flock, and does all she can to keep the\r\nkite from her brood, but often he breaks the row and catches his\r\nprey.--Mactaggart's _Gallovidian Encyclopædia_.\r\n\r\nEvidently denominated from the common mode of designating the kite among\r\nthe vulgar (Jamieson). \"The Greedy Gled's seeking ye,\" is one of the\r\nlines of a rhyme used in \"Hide and Seek\" in Edinburgh.

E. Tremlow).\r\n\r\n(_c_) The popular version of this game is played by the greater number\r\nof the children forming a line on one side with joined hands, and one\r\nchild (sometimes two or more) facing them, advancing and retiring while\r\nsinging the verses. When he asks the question, \"Will you come?\" one girl\r\non the opposite side answers \"No!\" and afterwards \"Yes!\" When this is\r\nsaid, she goes to the opposite side, and the two dance round together\r\nwhile singing the next verse. The game begins again by the two singing\r\nthe verses, and thus getting a third child to join them, when the game\r\nproceeds for a fourth, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe Congleton and London versions are played by two lines of children of\r\nabout equal numbers. In the Lincolnshire version the above description\r\nanswers, except that when the last line is sung every one claps hands.\r\nIn the Sussex version the child at the end of the line is taken over by\r\nthe child who sings the verses, and they lock their little fingers\r\ntogether while singing the remainder.\r\n\r\nAddy (_Sheffield Glossary_) says:--\"Two children advance and retire on\r\none side. When the opposite side says 'Yes!' the two take the first\r\nchild in the row and dance round with her, singing the remaining verse.\r\nThis is called 'the wedding.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Lanarkshire version is quite a different one, and contains rather\r\nremarkable features. Mr. Black says that the game was played entirely by\r\ngirls, never by boys, and generally in the months of May or June, about\r\nforty years ago. The children sang with rather mincing and refined\r\nvoices, evidently making an effort in this direction. They walked, with\r\ntheir hands clasped behind their backs, up and down the road. Each\r\nchild was crowned with rushes, and also had sashes or girdles of rushes.\r\n\r\nMr. Ballantyne says in his boyhood it was played by a row of boys on one\r\nside and another of girls opposite. The boys selected a girl when\r\nsinging the third verse.\r\n\r\nIn the Roxton version, one child at the end of the line of children acts\r\nas \"mother.\" One child advances as \"suitor,\" and says the three first\r\nverses. The \"mother\" replies with the next line. The \"suitor\" chooses a\r\ngirl and says the next verse, and then all the children sing the last\r\nverse. This is the same action as in Halliwell's version.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The analysis of the game-rhymes is on pp. 164-67. This analysis\r\npresents us with a very good example of the changes caused by the\r\ngame-rhymes being handed down by tradition among people who have\r\nforgotten the original meaning of the game. The first line in the Scotch\r\nversion contains the word \"dis,\" which is not known to the ordinary\r\nvocabulary. Another word, of similar import, is \"dik-ma-day\" in the\r\nLanarkshire version. Two other words occur, namely, \"thegan\" in the\r\nLanarkshire, and \"maycanameecan\" in the Sussex versions, which are also\r\nnot to be found in ordinary vocabularies. The two last words appear only\r\nonce, and cannot, therefore, be used for the purpose of tracing out an\r\noriginal form of the game-rhyme, because on the system of analysis\r\nadopted they may be arbitrary introductions and totally unconnected with\r\nthe original rhymes. This, however, is not the case with the two\r\nfirst-mentioned words, and I am inclined to consider them as forming\r\npart of the earliest version. The word \"dis\" is carried through no less\r\nthan ten out of the fourteen variants, the gradation in the forms being\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n  dis\r\n  dass\r\n  dish\r\n  diss[y]--duss\r\n  dossy\r\n  this--thus\r\n      --dust\r\n      --dust[y]\r\n\r\nWhat the meaning of this word is it may be impossible to ascertain,\r\nthough probably Mr. Newell may be correct in his suggestion that it\r\nrepresents the old English word \"adist,\" the opposite of \"ayont,\"\r\nmeaning \"this way,\" \"come hither\" (_Games of American Children_, p. 51).\r\nBut the point really is, that the version which contains the oldest\r\nword-forms would probably be the purest in other respects. The analysis\r\nof the whole game confirms this view, as the Scottish and Yorkshire\r\nversions are nearly parallel, while the discrepancies begin to creep in\r\nwith the Shropshire version, reaching their last stage in the versions\r\nrecorded by Halliwell and from Congleton. Following this line of\r\nargument, \"dik-ma-day\" becomes first \"duke, my dear,\" and then \"duck, my\r\ndear.\" Turning next to the import of the rhymes, apart from special\r\nwords used, it is curious to note that \"dis\" is only converted into\r\n\"dusty,\" and hence into \"dusty day,\" in two versions out of the\r\nfourteen. The Lincolnshire version agrees with Halliwell's version in\r\nmaking some curious offers for a pretty lass, but these rhymes are\r\nprobably an innovation. In the same way the incidents numbered 39-40,\r\noccurring in the Sussex version, and 43-46 occurring in the London and\r\nHants versions, are borrowings from other games, and not original\r\nportions of this. The Congleton version is evidently incomplete.\r\n\r\n  +----+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n  | No.| Scotland (Chambers). |     Lanarkshire.     |

+----+----------------------+\r\n\r\n(_e_) Henderson, in describing the curious rites accompanying the\r\nsaining or blessing of a corpse in the Scottish Lowlands, states that\r\nempty dishes are arranged on the hearth as near as possible to the fire,\r\nand after certain ceremonies in connection therewith have been\r\nperformed, the company join hands and dance round the dishes, singing\r\nthis burden:--\r\n\r\n    A dis, a dis, a dis,\r\n    A green griss;\r\n    A dis, a dis, a dis.\r\n\r\n--_Folk-lore of Northern Counties_, p. 54.\r\n\r\nThis rhyme is, it will be seen, the same as the first two lines of the\r\ngame, the word \"griss\" in the burial-rhyme becoming \"grass\" in the\r\ngame-rhyme, \"grisse\" being the old form for \"grass\" or herb (Halliwell,\r\n_Provincial Glossary_, quotes a MS. authority for this). This\r\nidentification of the game-rhyme would suggest that the game originally\r\nwas a child's dramatic imitation of an old burial ceremony, and it\r\nremains to be seen whether the signification of the words would carry\r\nout this idea.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the idea of death is a prominent incident in the\r\ngame, appearing in seven out of the fourteen versions. In all these\r\ncases the death is followed by the clapping of hands and bell-ringing,\r\nand in five cases by the singing of birds. Clapping of hands occurs in\r\ntwo other cases, and bell-ringing in one other case, not accompanied by\r\nthe death incident. Now it is singular that the burial-rite which has\r\njust been quoted is called Dish-a-loof; and a reference to the game of\r\n\"Dish-a-loof\" [under that title], will show that it derives its name\r\nfrom the clapping of hands. In the ceremony, as described by Henderson,\r\nalthough songs and games are part of the burial-ceremony, there is no\r\nspecific mention of hand-clapping; but it is conceivable that the action\r\nat one time formed part of the ceremony, and hence the name\r\n\"Dish-a-loof.\" This would not account for the promise of a duck, drake,\r\n&c., as in incidents Nos. 12 and 20; nor for the promise of a young\r\nprince or young man; but these incidents might very well be variants of\r\nsome earlier forms which are not now discoverable, especially as\r\nlove-games were played at funerals, and as the tendency, in the less\r\ncomplete forms of the game as they have come down to us, is in the\r\ndirection of transposing the game into a complete love-game. The use of\r\nrushes in the Lanarkshire game might indicate the funeral garland\r\n(Aubrey's _Remaines_, pp. 109, 139). For clapping of hands to indicate\r\nbell-tolling or bell-ringing at times of death see Napier's _Folklore_,\r\np. 66. Henderson (p. 63) says the \"passing bell\" was supposed in former\r\ntimes to serve two purposes: it called on all good Christians within\r\nhearing to pray for the departing spirit, and it scared away the evil\r\nspirits who were watching to seize it, or at least to scare and terrify\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn the whole evidence from the rhymes, therefore, I should be disposed\r\nto class this game as originally belonging to burial, and not love,\r\nrites.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreen Gravel\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Madeley, Shropshire (Miss Burne).\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Earls Heaton (H.

Around a green gravill\r\n           The grass is so green,\r\n           And all the fine ladies\r\n           Ashamed to be seen.\r\n           They wash 'em in milk\r\n           And dress 'em in silk--\r\n           We'll all cou' don' together.\r\n\r\n           My elbow, my elbow,\r\n           My pitcher and my can;\r\n           Isn't ----\r\n           A nice young gell?\r\n           Isn't ----\r\n           As nice as her--\r\n           They shall be married with a guinea-gold ring.\r\n\r\n           I peep'd through the window,\r\n           I peep'd through the door,\r\n           I seed pretty ----\r\n           A-dancin on the floor;\r\n           I cuddled her an' fo'dled her,\r\n           I set her on my knee;\r\n           I says pretty ----\r\n           Won't [ëe?] you marry me.\r\n\r\n           A new-swept parlour,\r\n           An' a new-made bed,\r\n           A new cup and saucer\r\n           Again we get wed.\r\n           If it be a boy, he shall have a hat,\r\n           To follow with his mammy to her na', na', na';\r\n           If he be a gell, she shall have a ring,\r\n           To follow with her mammy to her ding, ding, ding.\r\n\r\n--Wakefield (Miss Fowler).\r\n\r\n(_c_) The more general way of playing this game is to form a ring of\r\nchildren simply. The children walk round singing the verse as in the\r\nBelfast version, and when the last line is sung, the child whose name is\r\nmentioned turns round, facing the outside of the ring and having her\r\nback to the centre. She continues to hold hands with the others, and\r\ndances round with them in that position. This is repeated until all the\r\nchildren have \"turned\" their backs to the inside of the ring. Here the\r\ngame ends in many cases, but another verse is sung in the Lincoln,\r\nWinterton, and Wakefield versions from Miss Peacock, and this was sung\r\nalso in the London version. The second verse thus terminates the game,\r\nwith the players one by one reversing their position and facing the\r\ncentre of ring as at first. In the Forest of Dean and Wakefield\r\nversions the action of the game is somewhat different. A child stands in\r\nthe centre of the ring of children, without apparently taking much part\r\nin the game, except to name the children in turn. In the Wakefield\r\nversion, however (Miss Fowler, No. xvii.), a little boy stands in the\r\nmiddle of a circle of girls who sing the first verse. At \"We'll all cou'\r\ndon' together,\" all crouch down, as if in profound respect, then rising\r\nslowly, sing the next verse. After \"My pitcher and my can,\" each child\r\nmentions her own name. At \"Isn't ---- as nice as her?\" each mentions her\r\nsweetheart's name, and the child thus chosen goes into the circle. At\r\nthe end of the fourth verse they all clap hands, and the one that is\r\nsweetheart to him in the middle kisses him. The \"crouching down\" is also\r\ndone in the Forest of Dean version when singing the fourth line. The\r\nlast one to stoop has to name her sweetheart. When this is done, the\r\nchildren all dance round and sing the other lines.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The analysis of the game-rhymes is on pp. 178-181. The most\r\nconstant formulæ of this game-rhyme are shown by this analysis to be\r\nNos. 1, 6, 7, 13, 15, 18, 23, and the variants, though important, are\r\nnot sufficient to detract from the significance of the normal version.\r\nIt is evidently a funeral game. The green gravel and the green grass\r\nindicate the locality of the scene; \"green,\" as applied to gravel, may\r\nmean freshly disturbed, just as green grave means a freshly made grave.\r\nThe tenant of the new grave is the well-loved lady of a disconsolate\r\nlover, and probably the incidents of washing and dressing the corpse,\r\nand putting an inscription on the place where it is laid, are indicated\r\nby Nos. 13 and 15. The dirge, or singing to the dead, is indicated by\r\nNos. 18, 23, and 26, and the beauty of the first line is in complete\r\naccord with the mournful music. That No. 26 occurs in only two variants,\r\nDerbyshire and the Isle of Man, is curious, as the pathos of this appeal\r\nis very apparent in the movement of the game. The communion with the\r\ndead which is indicated by No. 23 is by no means considered impossible\r\nby the peasantry. In confirmation of this being a representation of an\r\nold funeral ceremony, it may be pointed out that the action of turning\r\nbackwards during the singing of the dirge is also represented in the\r\ncurious funeral ceremony called \"Dish-a-loof,\" which is described in\r\nHenderson's _Folk-lore of the Northern Counties_, p. 53. Henderson's\r\nwords are: \"All the attendants, going out of the room, return into it\r\nbackwards, repeating this rhyme of 'saining.'\" The additional ceremony\r\nof marriage in four of the games is clearly an interpolation, which may\r\nhave arisen from the custom of playing love and marriage games at\r\nfunerals and during the watching with the corpse, or may be a mere\r\ntransition to the more pleasant task of love-making as the basis of a\r\ngame. The Derbyshire incident (No. 24) may indicate indeed that the\r\nfuneral is that of a young bride, and in that case the tendency to make\r\nthe game wholly a marriage game is accounted for. The decay which has\r\nset in is apparent by the evident attempt to alter from \"green gravel\"\r\nto \"green grover\" and \"yellow gravel\" (Nos. 4 and 5), and to introduce\r\npen and black ink (No. 17). The addition of the incongruous elements\r\nfrom other games (Nos. 27-31) is a frequent occurrence in modern games,\r\nand is the natural result of decadence in the original form of the game.\r\nAltogether this game-rhyme affords a very good example of the condition\r\nof traditional games among the present generation of children.\r\n\r\n  +---+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n  |No.|      Belfast.        |      Shropshire.     |     Derbyshire.      |\r\n  +---+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n  | 1.|Green gravel.         |Green gravel.         |     --               |\r\n  | 2.|     --               |     --               |Around the green      |\r\n  |   |                      |                      |gravel.               |\r\n  | 3.|     --               |     --               |     --               |\r\n  | 4.|     --               |     --               |     --               |\r\n  | 5.|     --               |     --               |     --               |\r\n  | 6.|Your grass is so      |The grass is so green.|The grass is so green.|\r\n  |   |green.                |                      |                      |\r\n  | 7.|The fairest damsel    |     --               |     --               |\r\n  |   |ever seen.            |                      |                      |\r\n  | 8.|     --               |The fairest young lady|     --               |\r\n  |   |                      |ever seen.            |                      |\r\n  | 9.|     --               |     --               |All pretty maids are  |\r\n  |   |                      |                      |plain to be seen.     |\r\n  |10.|     --               |     --               |     --               |\r\n  |11.|     --               |     --               |     --               |\r\n  |12.|     --               |     --               |     --               |\r\n  |13.|Washed her, dried her,|     --               |     --               |\r\n  |   |rolled her in silk.   |                      |                      |\r\n  |14.|     --               |Wash you in milk,     |Wash them in milk,    |\r\n  |   |                      |clothe in silk.       |clothe in silk.       |\r\n  |15.|Wrote name in glass   |     --               |     --               |\r\n  |   |pen and ink.          |                      |                      |\r\n  |16.|     --               |Write name in gold pen|Write names in gold   |\r\n  |   |                      |and ink.              |pen and ink.          |\r\n  |17.|     --               |     --               |     --               |\r\n  |18.|Your true love is     |True love is dead.    |Her sweetheart is     |\r\n  |   |dead.                 |                      |dead.                 |\r\n  |19.|     --               |     --               |     --               |\r\n  |20.|     --               |     --               |     --               |\r\n  |21.|     --               |     --               |     --               |\r\n  |22.|     --               |     --               |     --               |\r\n  |23.|He sent letter to turn|He sent letter to turn|     --               |\r\n  |   |your head.            |your head.            |                      |\r\n  |24.|     --               |     --               |She's left off her    |\r\n  |   |                      |                      |wedding to turn back  |\r\n  |   |                      |                      |her head.             |\r\n  |25.|     --               |     --               |     --               |\r\n  |26.|     --               |     --               |Mother, is it true;   |\r\n  |   |                      |                      |What shall I do?

the Redhill\r\n(Surrey) version, have been sent by Miss Blair (South Shields); Mr. H.\r\nS. May, Ogbourne and Manton (Wilts); Mrs. Haddon (Cambridge); Mrs.\r\nHarley (Lancashire); and Miss Burne, Platt, near Wrotham (Kent). There\r\nare also similar printed versions in _Folk-lore Journal_, vi. 214\r\n(Dorsetshire); _Folk-lore Record_, v. 84 (Hersham, Surrey). Northall\r\nprints a version in his _Folk Rhymes_, 362-3, identical with No. 17. The\r\ntune of the Platt version sent by Miss Burne, and the Ogbourne and\r\nManton (H. S. May), are almost identical, except the termination. This\r\nseems to be the most general tune for the game. The Lancashire tune is\r\nthe same as the London version.\r\n\r\nMiss Burne says of the Madeley version: \"I never knew 'Green Gravel' and\r\n'Wallflowers' played together as in this way elsewhere (I had not got\r\nthis variant when I wrote _Shropshire Folk-lore_), except at Much\r\nWenlock, where they reverse the two verses, and only sing _one line_\r\n(the last) of 'Green Gravel.' But I feel sure they must have been\r\n_meant_ to go together (see my note in _Shropshire Folk-lore_, p. 510),\r\nand I can explain them, I think. The ring of girls are dancing on the\r\ngreen grass plot in the middle of an old-fashioned sixteenth-century\r\nwalled garden: each gets the news of her lover's death, and 'turns her\r\nface to the wall,' the old token of hopeless sorrow. Then they\r\napostrophise the wallflowers in the border surrounding the grass plot\r\nagainst the old high wall; and here another variant explains the lament\r\n(second line)--\r\n\r\n    Wallflowers, wallflowers, growing up so high,\r\n    _We shall all be maidens_ [and so], we shall all die;\r\n\r\nExcept the youngest (who will meet with another lover), whether as an\r\ninstance of the proverbial luck of the 'youngest born,' or as a piece of\r\njuvenile giddiness and inconstancy, I cannot say; but considering the\r\nvalue set on true love and hopeless constancy in the ballad-lore, and\r\nthe special garland which distinguished the funerals of bereaved but\r\nconstant maidens, and the solemnity of betrothal in old days, the latter\r\nseems probable, especially considering the 'for shame.'\"\r\n\r\nThe incidents of _washing_ a corpse in milk and _dressing_ it in silk\r\noccur in \"Burd Ellen,\" Jamieson's _Ballads_, p. 125.\r\n\r\n    \"Tak up, tak up my bonny young son,\r\n      Gar _wash_ him wi' the _milk_;\r\n    Tak up, tak up my fair lady,\r\n      Gar row her in the _silk_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGreen Grow the Leaves (1)\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Earls Heaton (Mr. Hardy).\r\n\r\n    I.

The first and\r\nthird lines are sung three times. Partners are chosen during the singing\r\nof the last line. Miss Peacock adds, \"The rest wanting, as my informant\r\nhad forgotten the game.\" In the Sharleston version the children march\r\nround two by two, in a double circle, with one child in the centre,\r\nsinging the verse. At the conclusion, the children who are marching on\r\nthe inner side of the circle leave their partners and take the place of\r\none in front of them, while the centre child endeavours to get one of\r\nthe vacant places, the child turned out taking the place of the one in\r\nthe centre, when the game begins again. In the Earls Heaton version\r\nthere is the circle of children, with one child in the centre, who\r\nchooses a partner after the lines have been sung.\r\n\r\n(_c_) From this it would seem that while the Lincolnshire and\r\nNottinghamshire words appear to be the most complete, the action has\r\nbeen preserved best at Sharleston. The acting of this version is the\r\nsame as that of \"The Jolly Miller.\" The third variant is evidently an\r\nimitation of the song, \"John Brown.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGreen Grow the Leaves (2)\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Northants (R.

S. Baker (_Northants Notes and Queries_, ii. 161).\r\n\r\n(_b_) One couple is chosen to lead, and they go off, whither they will,\r\nfollowed by a long train of youths and maidens, all singing the refrain.\r\nSometimes the leaders part company, and branch off to the right or left;\r\nthe others have to do the same, and not until the leaders meet can they\r\njoin again. They march arm in arm.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Mr. R. S. Baker, who records this, says a Wellingborough lady sent\r\nhim the tune and words, and told him the game was more like a country\r\ndance than anything else, being a sort of dancing \"Follow My Leader.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGully\r\n\r\nA sink, or, failing that, a particular stone in the pavement was the\r\n\"Gully.\" Some boy chosen by lot, or one who volunteered in order to\r\nstart the game, laid his top on the ground at some distance from the\r\n\"Gully.\" The first player then spun his top, pegging at the recumbent\r\ntop, so as to draw it towards the \"Gully.\" If he missed the top, he\r\nstooped down and took up his own top by pushing his hand against it in\r\nsuch a manner that the space between his first and second finger caught\r\nagainst the peg and forced the top into the palm of his hand. He then\r\nhad \"a go\" at the recumbent top (I forget what this was called), and\r\nsent his own top against it so as to push it towards the \"Gully.\" If he\r\nmissed, he tried again and again, until his own top could spin no\r\nlonger. If he did not hit the top with his own while it was spinning,\r\nhis top had to be laid down and the other one taken up, and its owner\r\ntook his turn at pegging. When a spinning-top showed signs of\r\nexhaustion, and the taking it up might kill it, and it was not very far\r\nfrom the down-lying top, its owner would gently push it with his finger,\r\nso as to make it touch the other top, and so avoid putting it into the\r\nother's place. This was called \"kissing,\" and was not allowed by some\r\nplayers. When one player succeeded in sending the top into the \"Gully,\"\r\nhe took it up and fixed it by its peg into a post, mortar of a wall, or\r\nthe best place where it could be tolerably steady. Holding it by one\r\nhand, he drove the peg of his own top as far as he could into the crown\r\nof the victim top. This was called \"taking a grudge.\" He then held\r\neither his own or the victim top and knocked the other against the wall,\r\nthe object being to split the victim. He was allowed three \"grudges.\" If\r\nthe top did not give way, the other players tried in turn. If the top\r\ndid not split, it was returned to its owner, but any boy who succeeded\r\nin splitting it through the middle, so that the peg fell out, took\r\npossession of the peg. I have seen a top split at the side in such a way\r\nas to be quite useless as a top, though no peg was gained. I remember,\r\ntoo, a schoolfellow of mine drawing from his pocket some seven or eight\r\npegs, the trophied memorials of as many tops.--London (J. P. Emslie).\r\n\r\nSee \"Hoatie,\" \"Hoges,\" \"Peg-top.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHairry my Bossie\r\n\r\nThis is a game of chance. The players are two, and may be boys or girls,\r\nor a boy and a girl. The stakes may be pins, buttons, marbles, or\r\nanything for which children gamble. One player puts a number, one, two,\r\nthree or more, of the articles to be gambled for into the hollow of the\r\nclosed hand, and says, \"Hairry my bossie;\" the other answers, \"Knock 'im\r\ndown,\" upon which he puts his closed hands down with a blow on his\r\nknees, and continues to strike them upwards and downwards on the knee,\r\nso as to give the opponent in play an idea of the number of objects\r\nconcealed by the sound given forth. He then says, \"How many blows?\" and\r\ngets the reply, \"As many's goes.\" A guess is then made. If the guess is\r\ncorrect the guesser gets the objects. If the guess is incorrect the\r\nguesser has to make up the difference between the number guessed and the\r\nreal number. The players play alternately. This game was played for the\r\nmost part at Christmas.--Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\n(_b_) Hairry = \"rob,\" Bossie = \"a wooden bowl,\" commonly used for making\r\nthe leaven in baking oat-cakes, and for making \"brose.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a very general game amongst schoolboys.\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf-Hammer\r\n\r\nThe game of \"Hop-step-and-jump,\" Norfolk. This game is played in the\r\nwest of Sussex, but not in the east. It is played thus by two or more\r\nboys. Each boy in his turn stands first on one leg and makes a hop, then\r\nstrides or steps, and lastly, putting both feet together, jumps. The boy\r\nwho covers the most ground is the victor.--Halliwell's _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHan'-and-Hail\r\n\r\nA game common in Dumfries, thus described by Jamieson. Two goals called\r\nhails, or dules, are fixed on at about a distance of four hundred\r\nyards. The two parties then place themselves in the middle between the\r\ngoals or dules, and one of the players, taking a soft elastic ball,\r\nabout the size of a man's fist, tosses it into the air, and, as it\r\nfalls, strikes it with his palm towards his antagonists. The object of\r\nthe game is for either party to drive the ball beyond the goal which\r\nlies before them, while their opponents do all in their power to prevent\r\nthis. As soon as the ball is gowf't, that is, struck away, the opposite\r\nparty endeavour to intercept it in its fall. This is called keppan' the\r\nba'. If they succeed in this attempt, the player who does so is entitled\r\nto throw the ball with all his might towards his antagonists. If he kep\r\nit in the first bound which it makes off the ground, called a stot, he\r\nis allowed to haunch, that is, to throw the ball by bringing his hand\r\nwith a sweep past his thigh, to which he gives a stroke as his hand\r\npasses, and discharging the ball at the moment when the stroke is given.\r\nIf the ball be caught in the second bounce, the catcher may hoch the\r\nball, that is, throw it through below one of his houghs. If none of the\r\nparty catch the ball, it must be gowf't in the manner before described.\r\nAs soon as either of the parties succeed in driving the ball, or, as it\r\nis called, hailin' the dules, the game then begins by one of the party\r\nwhich was successful throwing the ball towards the opposing goal and the\r\nother party striving to drive it back.\r\n\r\n\r\nHand in and Hand out\r\n\r\nA game played by a company of young people who are drawn up in a circle,\r\nwhen one of them, pitched upon by lot, walks round the band, and, if a\r\nboy, hits a girl, or, if a girl, she strikes a boy whom she chooses, on\r\nwhich the party striking and the party struck run in pursuit of each\r\nother till the latter is caught, whose lot it then becomes to perform\r\nthe same part. A game so called was forbidden by statute of Edward\r\nIV.--Halliwell's _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\nSee \"Drop Handkerchief.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHandy-Croopen\r\n\r\nA game in which one of the players turns his face to the wall, his hand\r\nresting upon his back. He must continue in position until he guesses who\r\nstruck his hand, when the striker takes his place.--Orkney and Shetland\r\n(Jamieson's _Dictionary_).\r\n\r\nSee \"Hot Cockles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHandy Dandy\r\n\r\n    I.

Handy pandy, Jack a dandy,\r\n           Which hand will you have?\r\n\r\n--Burne's _Shropshire Folk-lore_, p. 530.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The hands are closed, some small article is put in one of them\r\nbehind the back of the player. The closed fists are then turned rapidly\r\nround one another while the rhyme is being said, and they are then\r\nplaced one on top of the other. A guess is then made by any one of the\r\nplayers as to which hand the object is in. If correct, the guesser\r\nobtains the object; if incorrect, the player who performs \"Handy dandy\"\r\nkeeps it.\r\n\r\n(_c_) This game is mentioned in _Piers Plowman_, p. 69 of Wright's\r\nedition. Douce quotes an ancient MS. which curiously mentions the game\r\nas \"men play with little children at 'handye-dandye,' which hand will\r\nyou have\" (ii. 167). Johnson says: \"'Handy dandy,' a play in which\r\nchildren change hands and places: 'See how yon justice rails upon yon\r\nsimple thief! Hark, in thine ear: change places, and, handy dandy,\r\nwhich is the justice, which is the thief?\" (_King Lear_, iv. 6). Malone\r\nsays, \"'Handy dandy' is, I believe, a play among children, in which\r\nsomething is shaken between two hands, and then a guess is made in which\r\nhand it is retained.\" See Florio's _Italian Dictionary_, 1598:\r\n\"Bazzicchiare, to shake between the hands; to play 'Handy dandy.'\" Pope,\r\nin his _Memoirs of Cornelius Scriblerus_, in forbidding certain sports\r\nto his son Martin till he is better informed of their antiquity, says:\r\n\"Neither cross and pile, nor ducks and drakes, are quite so ancient as\r\n'Handy dandy,' though Macrobius and St. Augustine take notice of the\r\nfirst, and Minutius Foelix describes the latter; but 'Handy dandy' is\r\nmentioned by Aristotle, Plato, and Aristophanes.\" Browne, in\r\n_Britannia's Pastorals_ (i. 5), also alludes to the game.\r\n\r\nSee \"Neiveie-nick-nack.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHap the Beds\r\n\r\nA singular game, gone through by hopping on one foot, and with that foot\r\nsliding a little flat stone out of an oblong bed, rudely drawn on a\r\nsmooth piece of ground. This bed is divided into eight parts, the two of\r\nwhich at the farther end of it are called the Kail-pots. If the player\r\nthen stands at one end, and pitches the smooth stone into all the\r\ndivisions one after the other, following the same on a foot (at every\r\nthrow), and bringing it out of the figure, this player wins not only the\r\ngame, but is considered a first-rate daub at it; failing, however, to go\r\nthrough all the parts so, without missing either a throw or a hop, yet\r\nkeeping before the other gamblers (for many play at one bed), still wins\r\nthe curious rustic game.--Mactaggart's _Gallovidian Encyclopædia_.\r\n\r\nA game called \"The Beds,\" mentioned by a writer in _Blackwood's\r\nMagazine_, August 1821, p. 36, as played in Edinburgh when he was a boy\r\nby girls only, is described as a game where a pitcher is kicked into\r\nchalked divisions of the pavement, the performer being on one leg and\r\nhopping.\r\n\r\nSee \"Hop-scotch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHard Buttons\r\n\r\nSeveral boys place one button each close together on a line. The game\r\nconsists in hitting a particular button out of this line with the nicker\r\nwithout touching the others. This is generally played in London streets,\r\nand is mentioned in the _Strand Magazine_, ii. 515.\r\n\r\nSee \"Banger,\" \"Buttons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHare and Hounds\r\n\r\nA boys' game. One boy is chosen as the Hare. He carries with him a bag\r\nfilled with strips of paper. The rest of the boys are the Hounds. The\r\nHare has a certain time (say fifteen minutes) allowed him for a start,\r\nand he goes across country, scattering some paper on his way in order to\r\nindicate his track.

The first two verses are\r\nsung first by one and then by the other of the two girls. At the finish\r\nof these the girl then going through the arch is stopped, and the third,\r\nfourth, and fifth verses are sung by the two girls alternately. Then\r\nfinally both girls sing the last verse, and the child is sent as\r\nprisoner behind one or other of the two girls. The verses are then begun\r\nagain, and repeated afresh for each of the troop marching through the\r\narch until all of them are placed behind one or other of the two girls.\r\nThe two sides thus formed then proceed to tug against each other, and\r\nthe strongest side wins the game.\r\n\r\nThe Belfast version is practically the same, except that the verses are\r\nnot sung as a dialogue, but by all the players together, and the\r\nprisoner, when caught, has the choice of sides, by being asked, \"Which\r\nwill you have, a golden apple or golden pear?\" and according to the\r\nanswer given is sent behind one of the leaders. The Norfolk and\r\nShropshire games are different. Miss Matthews thus describes the\r\nNorfolk game: \"Two girls take hold of hands, and another, the prisoner,\r\nstands between them. The rest form themselves into a line opposite, and\r\nadvance and retreat while singing the first verse, the gaolers singing\r\nthe next verse, and so on alternately. [At the end of the last verse but\r\none] the children break the line, form themselves into a ring, and dance\r\nround the prisoner, singing the final verse.\" Miss Harley describes the\r\nShropshire version as follows: \"The first six verses are sung by the\r\nalternate parties, who advance and retire, tramping their feet, at\r\nfirst, to imitate the robbers. The last verse is sung altogether going\r\nround in a ring.\" In the Shipley version, Miss Busk says: \"The children\r\nform themselves into two lines, while two or three, representing the\r\nrobbers, swagger along between them. When the robbers sing the last\r\nverse they should have attained the end of the lines [of children], as\r\nduring the parley they were safe; having pronounced the defiance they\r\nrun away. The children in the lines rush after them, and should catch\r\nthem and put them in prison.\"\r\n\r\n(_c_) The analysis of this game is easy. The Deptford, Belfast, and\r\nWolstanton versions are clearly enough dramatic representations of the\r\ncapture of a robber, and probably the game dates from the period of the\r\nprevalence of highway robbery. The Wolstanton version shows us that the\r\ngame is breaking up from its earlier form, while the Norfolk and\r\nShropshire versions show a fresh development into the mere game for\r\nchildren, apart from its original significance. The action of the game\r\nconfirms this view. The Norfolk action seems to be the most nearly\r\nperfect in its dramatic significance, and the Shropshire action comes\r\nnext. The action of the other games seems to have been grafted on to the\r\nsuperior form of \"Oranges and Lemons.\" It is probable that this fact has\r\npreserved the words more completely than in the other cases, where the\r\nforce of the robber action would become less and less as actual\r\nexperience of robbers and robbery died out. Altogether, this game\r\nsupplies a very good example of the change produced in games by changes\r\nin the actual life which gave rise to them. It is singular that the\r\nverses of this game also enter into the composition of \"London Bridge is\r\nbroken down.\" It is probable, therefore, that it may be an altered form\r\nof the game of \"London Bridge.\" The refrain, \"My fair lady,\" occurs in\r\nboth games.\r\n\r\nSee \"London Bridge.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHats in Holes\r\n\r\nA boys' game. The players range their hats in a row against the wall,\r\nand each boy in turn pitches a ball from a line at some twenty-five feet\r\ndistance into one of the hats. The boy into whose hat it falls has to\r\nseize it and throw it at one or other of the others, who all scamper off\r\nwhen the ball is \"packed in.\" If he fails to hit he is out, and takes\r\nhis cap up. The boy whose cap is left at the last has to \"cork\" the\r\nothers, that is, to throw the ball at their bent backs, each in turn\r\nstooping down to take his punishment.--Somerset (Elworthy's _Dialect_).\r\n\r\nSee \"Balls and Bonnets.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHattie\r\n\r\nA game with preens, pins, on the crown of a hat. Two or more may play.\r\nEach lays on a pin, then with the hand they strike the side of the hat\r\ntime about, and whoever makes the pins by a stroke cross each other,\r\nlifts those so crossed.--Mactaggart's _Gallovidian Encyclopædia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHawkey\r\n\r\nA game played by several boys on each side with sticks called \"hawkey\r\nbats,\" and a ball. A line is drawn across the middle of the ground from\r\none side to the other; one party stands on one side of the line and the\r\nopposite party on the other, and neither must overstep this boundary,\r\nbut are allowed to reach over as far as their bats will permit to strike\r\nthe ball. The object is to strike the ball to the farther end to touch\r\nthe fence of the opposing party's side, when the party so striking the\r\nball scores one, and, supposing nine to be the game, the party obtaining\r\nthat number first of course wins the game.--West Sussex (Holloway's\r\n_Dict. of Provincialisms_).\r\n\r\nSee \"Bandy,\" \"Doddart,\" \"Hockey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHeadicks and Pinticks\r\n\r\nThis game was played only at Christmas. The number of players was two.\r\nThe stakes were pins. One player laid in the hollow of the hand, or on\r\none of the forefingers, a pin, and then placed the other forefinger over\r\nit so as to conceal it. He then held up his hand to his opponent and\r\nsaid, \"Headicks or pinticks?\" His opponent made a guess by pointing with\r\nhis finger and saying \"Headicks,\" or \"Pinticks.\" If the guess was\r\ncorrect he gained the pin, but if it was incorrect he forfeited one. The\r\nplayers played alternately.--Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\nAnother version seems to be \"Headim and Corsim.\" Pins are hid with\r\nfingers in the palms of the hands; the same number is laid alongside\r\nthem, and either \"Headim\" or \"Corsim\" called out by those who do so.\r\nWhen the fingers are lifted, if the heads of the pins hid and those\r\nbeside them be lying one way when the crier cried \"Headim,\" then that\r\nplayer wins; but if \"Corsim,\" the one who hid the pins wins. This is the\r\nking of all the games at the preens.--Mactaggart's _Gallovidian\r\nEncyclopædia_.\r\n\r\nThe editors of Jamieson's _Dictionary_ say that the name should be\r\n\"Headum and Corsum.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHeads and Tails\r\n\r\nThat plan for deciding matters by the \"birl o' a bawbee.\" The one side\r\ncries \"Heads\" (when the piece is whirling in the air) and the other\r\n\"Tails,\" so whichever is uppermost when the piece alights that gains or\r\nsettles the matter, heads standing for the King's head and tails for\r\nthe figure who represents Britannia.--Mactaggart's _Gallovidian\r\nEncyclopædia_.

Thirty or forty children in two\r\nrows, joining opposite hands, strike smartly with their hands thus\r\njoined on the head or shoulders of their companion as he runs the\r\ngauntlet through them. This is called \"passing through the mires of\r\nHecklebirnie.\"--Jamieson.\r\n\r\nThe editors of Jamieson append a lengthy note connecting the name of\r\nthis game with the northern belief that the wicked were condemned to\r\nsuffer eternal punishment in Hecla, the volcanic mountain in Iceland.\r\n\r\nSee \"Namers and Guessers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHen and Chicken\r\n\r\n    Chickery, chickery, cranny crow,\r\n    I went to the well to wash my toe,\r\n    When I got back a chicken was dead.\r\n\r\nThis verse is said by the Hen to her Chickens, after which they all go\r\nwith the Hen to search for the dead Chicken. On their way they meet the\r\nFox. The following dialogue between the Fox and Hen ensues, the Hen\r\nbeginning:--\r\n\r\n    What are you doing?\r\n    Picking up sticks.\r\n    What for?\r\n    To make a fire.\r\n    What's the fire for?\r\n    To boil some water.\r\n    What's the water for?\r\n    To boil some chickens in.\r\n    Where do you get them from?\r\n    Out of your flock.\r\n    That I'm sure you won't.\r\n\r\n--Derbyshire (_Folk-lore Journal_, i. 386).\r\n\r\nThe game is played in the usual manner of \"Fox and Goose\" games. One is\r\nchosen to be the Hen, and one to be the Fox. The rest are the Chickens.\r\nThe Chickens take hold of each other's waists, the first one holding the\r\nHen's waist. At the end of the dialogue the Fox tries to get hold of one\r\nof the chickens. If he succeeds in catching them, they all with the Fox\r\ntry to dodge the Hen, who makes an effort to regain them.\r\n\r\nIt is known at Winterton under the name of \"Pins and Needles.\" The\r\nplayers stand in a row, one behind another, with one of the party as\r\ntheir Leader. Another player, called \"Outsider,\" pretends to scratch the\r\nground. The Leader asks, the questions, and the Outsider replies--\r\n\r\n    What are you scratching for?\r\n    Pins and needles.\r\n    What do you want your pins and needles for?\r\n    To mend my poke.\r\n    What do you want your poke for?\r\n    To put some sand in.\r\n    What do you want your sand for?\r\n    To sharpen knives with.\r\n    What do you want your knives for?\r\n    To cut all the little chickens' heads off with.\r\n\r\nHere the Outsider tries to dodge past the Leader to catch one of the\r\nchildren at the further end of the row, the Leader meanwhile attempting\r\nto bar her progress. When at last she succeeds, the child caught takes\r\nher place, and the game is recommenced.--Winterton (Miss M.

The child sings the first verse and the line\r\nreplies, the four succeeding verses being alternately sung. After the\r\nlast line the girl tries to pull one whom she has chosen from the line\r\ntoward her. If not successful, she must try again. If she is, they both\r\nstand in the middle, and commence singing the words again with--\r\n\r\n    Here come _two_ virgins on their knees, &c.\r\n\r\nProbably a degraded version of \"Three Lords from Spain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHere I sit on a Cold Green Bank\r\n\r\n    Here I sit on a cold green bank\r\n    On a cold and frosty morning.\r\n\r\n    We'll send a young man [_or_ woman] to take you away,\r\n    To take you away,\r\n    We'll send a young man to take you away,\r\n    On a cold and frosty morning.\r\n\r\n    Pray tell me what his name shall be? [_or_]\r\n    Pray, whom will you send to take me away?\r\n\r\n    We'll send Mr. ---- to take you away.\r\n\r\nThe children form a ring around one of the party, who sits in the\r\nmiddle, and says the two first lines. Then those in the circle dance\r\nround her, singing the next four lines. This is repeated three times,\r\nwith the refrain, \"On a cold,\" &c., after which the dancing and singing\r\ncease, and the child is asked, \"Sugar, sweet, or vinegar, sour?\" Her\r\nanswer is always taken in a contrary sense, and sung, as before, three\r\ntimes, whilst the children circle round. The one in the middle then\r\nrises to her feet. The boy (or girl) named advances and kisses her, they\r\nchange places, and the game begins again.--Cornwall (_Folk-lore\r\nJournal_, v. 56-57).\r\n\r\n\r\nHere stands a Young Man\r\n\r\n    I.

At the\r\nfourth line the child in the centre chooses one from the ring, who goes\r\ninto the centre with her. The marriage formula or chorus is then sung,\r\nthe two kiss, and the one who was first in the centre joins the ring,\r\nthe second one choosing another in her turn.

Louth (Miss R. Stephen).\r\n\r\n(_b_) One child stands in the middle, the others dance round singing.\r\nThe one in the middle chooses another before the four last lines are\r\nsung. Then the rest dance round singing these lines, and kiss each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n(_c_) It is evident that these words comprise two distinct games, which\r\nhave become mixed in some inexplicable fashion. The first six lines and\r\nthe last four are one game, a ring form, with the marriage formula and\r\nblessing. The other portion of the game is a dialogue game, evidently\r\nhaving had two lines of players, questions being asked and answers\r\ngiven. It is, in fact, a part of the \"Three Dukes\" game. The first part\r\nis a kiss-in-the-ring game, a version of \"Here stands a Young Man,\"\r\n\"Silly Old Man,\" and \"Sally Water.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHewley Puley\r\n\r\n                       Take this, What's this?\r\n                       Hewley Puley.\r\n                       Where's my share?\r\n                       About the kite's neck.\r\n                       Where's the kite?\r\n                       Flown to the wood.\r\n                       Where's the wood?\r\n                       The fire has burned it.\r\n                       Where's the fire?\r\n                       The water's quenched it.\r\n                       Where's the water?\r\n                       The ox has drunk it.\r\n                       Where's the ox?\r\n                       The butcher has killed it.\r\n                       Where's the butcher?\r\n                       The rope has hanged him.\r\n                       Where's the rope?\r\n                       The rat has gnawed it.\r\n                       Where's the rat?\r\n                       The cat has killed it.\r\n                       Where's the cat?\r\n    Behind the door, cracking pebble-stones and marrow-bones for yours\r\n    and my supper, and the one who speaks first shall have a box on the\r\n    ear.\r\n\r\n--Halliwell's _Nursery Rhymes_, p. 222.\r\n\r\nThe children are seated, and the questions are put by one of the party\r\nwho holds a twisted handkerchief or something of the sort in the hand.\r\nThe handkerchief was called \"hewley puley,\" and the questions are asked\r\nby the child who holds it. If one answers wrongly, a box on the ear with\r\nthe handkerchief was the consequence; but if they all replied correctly,\r\nthe one who broke silence first had that punishment.\r\n\r\nFor similar rhymes see \"Dump,\" \"Mother, may I go out?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHey Wullie Wine\r\n\r\n    I.

If the lad was pleased with the choice\r\nmade, he replied--\r\n\r\n    I'll set her up on a bonnie pear-tree,\r\n    It's tall and straight, and sae is she;\r\n    I'd keep wauken a' night her love to be.\r\n\r\nIf he was not pleased, he replied in one or other of the next three\r\nverses--\r\n\r\n    I'll set her up ayont the dike,\r\n    She'll be rotten ere I be ripe,\r\n    The corbies her auld banes wull pike.\r\n\r\n    I'll set her up on a high crab-tree,\r\n    It's sour and dour, and so is she;\r\n    She may gang to the mools unkissed by me.\r\n\r\n    Though she be good and fair to see,\r\n    She's for another, and no for me;\r\n    But I thank you for your courtesie.\r\n\r\nWhen a girl took the place of the lad, she replied in one or other of\r\nthe three following, according as she was angry or pleased--\r\n\r\n    I'll put him in a riddle\r\n    And riddle him o'er the sea,\r\n    And sell to Johnny Groat's\r\n    For a Scotch bawbee.\r\n\r\n    I'll set him up on my lum-head [chimney],\r\n    And blaw him up wi' pouther and lead;\r\n    He'll never be kissed though he be dead.\r\n\r\n    I'll set him up at my table head,\r\n    Feed him wi' sweet milk and bread,\r\n    If he likes gang hame on his fine steed.\r\n\r\n--Biggar (Wm. Ballantyne).\r\n\r\n(_b_) In Biggar, all the players were seated round the hearthstone, lads\r\non one side, lassies the other; one lad rising up said the first verse,\r\nthen one acting as \"maister\" said the next verse. The young man then\r\nsaid the next two lines, to which the other replied in the two\r\nfollowing, and naming at the close any girl he thought would be\r\nacceptable. If the lad was pleased he sang the next verse. If he was\r\nnot pleased with the girl offered him he replied in either of the three\r\nfollowing verses. The first of the three was generally said if the girl\r\nwas thought to be too old; if bad-tempered, the second. If the lad found\r\nno fault, but wished to politely refuse, he sang the last verse. The\r\ngirl then was asked in her turn, and the same formula gone through, she\r\nsaying either of the three last verses given. Forfeits were demanded for\r\nevery refusal, and were cried at the end of the game.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Mr. Ballantyne writes: \"This game was a great favourite in my\r\nfather's house. This was a forfeit game, forfeits being called 'wadds.'\"\r\nChambers, _Popular Rhymes_, p. 124, gives a version of this game. It is\r\npractically the same as Mr. Ballantyne's version, with only a few verbal\r\ndifferences. Mactaggart says, \"The chief drift of this singular game\r\nseemed to be to discover the sweethearts of one another,\" and such\r\ndiscoveries are thought valuable, but not so much as they were\r\nanciently. In any case, it appears to me that the game is an early one,\r\nor, at all events, a reflection of early custom.\r\n\r\n\r\nHickety, Bickety\r\n\r\n    Hickety, bickety, pease-scone,\r\n    Where shall this poor Scotchman gang?\r\n    Will he gang east, or will he gang west,\r\n    Or will he gang to the craw's nest?\r\n\r\n--Chambers (_Popular Rhymes_, p. 122).\r\n\r\nOne boy stands with his eyes bandaged and his hands against a wall, with\r\nhis head resting on them. Another stands beside him repeating the rhyme,\r\nwhilst the others come one by one and lay their hands upon his back, or\r\njump upon it. When he has sent them all to different places he turns\r\nround and calls, \"Hickety, bickety!\" till they have all rushed back to\r\nthe place, the last in returning being obliged to take his place, when\r\nthe game goes on as before.\r\n\r\nChambers adds, \"The 'craw's nest' is close beside the eye-bandaged boy,\r\nand is therefore an envied position.\" Newell, _Games_, p. 165, refers to\r\nthis game.\r\n\r\nSee \"Hot Cockles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHickety-hackety\r\n\r\nThe game of Hop-scotch, played with a piece of tile, which has to be\r\nkicked by the player with the foot on which he hops over lines into\r\nvarious squares marked on the ground.--Somersetshire (Elworthy's\r\n_Dialect_).\r\n\r\nSee \"Hop-scotch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHick, Step, and Jump\r\n\r\nThe game of \"Hop, step, and jump.\"--Somerset (Holloway's _Dict. of\r\nProvincialisms_).\r\n\r\nSee \"Half-Hammer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHide and Seek (1)\r\n\r\nA writer in _Blackwood's Magazine_, August 1821, p. 36, mentions this as\r\na summer game. It was called \"Ho, spy!\" the words which are called out\r\nby those boys who have hidden. He says the watchword of \"Hide and seek\"\r\nwas \"hidee,\" and gives as the rhyme used when playing--\r\n\r\n    Keep in, keep in, wherever you be,\r\n    The greedy gled's seeking ye.\r\n\r\nThis rhyme is also given by Chambers (_Popular Rhymes_, p. 122).\r\nHalliwell gives the rhyme as--\r\n\r\n    Hitty titty indoors,\r\n    Hitty titty out,\r\n    You touch Hitty titty,\r\n    And Hitty titty will bite you.\r\n\r\n--_Nursery Rhymes_, p. 213.\r\n\r\nAt Ashford-in-the-Water the words used were--\r\n\r\n    One a bin, two a bin, three a bin, four,\r\n    Five a bin, six a bin, seven, gie o'er;\r\n    A bunch of pins, come prick my shins,\r\n    A loaf brown bread, come knock me down.\r\n           I'm coming!\r\n\r\n--_Reliquary_, viii. 57.\r\n\r\nThe words are said by the one who has to find the person hidden.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the game is called \"Hospy,\" and is played by boys only, and\r\nit can be played only in a village or hamlet in which there is the means\r\nof hiding. A Spy is chosen, and a spot, called Parley, is fixed upon at\r\nwhich the Spy stands till all the other players are hid, and to which he\r\ncan run when pursued. When the players are hid, the cry, \"Hospy,\"\r\n_i.e._, \"Ho! spy!\" is raised by them. The Spy then sets out to find\r\nthem. The moment he detects one he turns and runs with all his might to\r\nthe Parley, pursued by the one he has discovered. If he is overtaken, he\r\nmust carry on his back the pursuer to the Parley. The same thing is gone\r\nthrough till all the players are discovered.--Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\nJamieson says, \"'Hy Spy,' a game resembling 'Hide and Seek,' but played\r\nin a different manner. The station, which in England is called Home, is\r\nhere the Den, and those who keep it are the Seekers, and are called the\r\nIns. Those who hide themselves, instead of crying 'Hoop,' as in England,\r\ncry 'Hy spy;' and they are denominated the Outs. The business of the Ins\r\nis, after the signal is given, to lay hold of the Outs before they can\r\nreach the den. The captive then becomes one of the Ins; for the honour\r\nof the game consists in the privilege of hiding oneself.\" Jamieson adds,\r\n\"Hy is still used in calling after a person, to excite attention, or\r\nwhen it is wished to warn him to get out of the way.\" Strutt describes\r\nit as \"Harry-Racket,\" or \"Hide and Seek\" (_Sports_, p. 381).\r\n\r\nAt Cork two sides are chosen for Spy; one side hides while the other\r\nside hunts. When the hunters see one of the hidden players, they call\r\nout, \"I spy ----,\" and the child's name. The player called must run\r\nafter the Spy and try to catch him before he reaches his Den; if he\r\nsucceeds, the one caught must go to the opposite side of players, then\r\nnext time the spies hide, and those who have been hiding, spy (Miss\r\nKeane). A more general form of the game is for one child to hide, and to\r\nmake a noise in a disguised voice to give notice of his whereabouts, or\r\nto call out \"Whoop!\" or \"Coo!\" Until this noise or call is made, the\r\nsearchers may not seek him. If when spied or discovered the hider cannot\r\nreach home before being caught, he again has to hide (A. B. Gomme).\r\n\r\n(_b_) In the parish church of Bawdrip is a monument to Edward Lovell,\r\nhis wife Eleanor (_née_ Bradford), and their two daughters Maria and\r\nEleanor. The inscription touching the latter is:--\"Eleanora . . . obiit\r\nJun. 14, 1681. Hanc, subito et immaturo (ipsos pene inter hymenæos) fato\r\ncorreptam, m[oe]stissimus luxit maritus, et in gratam piamq. parentum\r\nsororis et dilectissimæ conjugis memoriam, monumentum hoc erigi voluit.\"\r\nTradition connects this sudden death--\"ipsos pene inter hymenæos\"--with\r\nthe story of the bride playing at \"Hide and Seek.\" It is curious that,\r\nin Haynes Bayly's song, the bridegroom's name should be Lovell. There is\r\nno mention on the monument of the name of the bereaved husband. The\r\nfather, Edward Lovell, was fourteen years rector of Bawdrip and fellow\r\nof Jesus College, Cambridge, and died in 1675, and so could not have\r\nbeen present at the wedding, as represented in the song. He came from\r\nBatcombe, near Castle-Cary; at which latter place the Lovells were\r\nseated in very early days.--_Notes and Queries_, 4th Ser., ix. 477.\r\n\r\nCope (_Hampshire Glossary_) calls the game \"I spy I.\" Lowsley\r\n(_Berkshire Glossary_) says, \"In playing this game, the seeker has to\r\ncall out 'I spy!' to the one he finds before he may start for home.\" It\r\nis called \"Hy Spy\" in Patterson's _Antrim and Down Glossary_; Evans'\r\n_Leicestershire Glossary_, \"Hide and Wink;\" Barnes' _Dorset Glossary_,\r\n\"Hidy Buck.\"\r\n\r\nIn Pegge's _Alphabet of Kenticisms_ the game is given as \"Hide and Fox.\"\r\n_Cf._ \"Hide Fox, and all after,\" _i.e._, let the fox hide and the others\r\ngo to seek him; Hamlet, iv. 2, 32. In Stead's _Holderness Glossary_,\r\n\"Hed-o.\" In the North Riding it is \"Lam-pie-sote-it,\" also called\r\n\"Felto\" in Robinson's _Whitby Glossary_. He also mentions that the\r\nhidden child cries \"How-ly\" to the finder. Apparently the same as the\r\nsouth country \"Whoop,\" a signal to the finder to begin the search. Addy\r\n(_Sheffield Glossary_) says this game is called \"Felt and Laite.\"\r\nHolland (_Cheshire Glossary_) speaks of it as \"I Spy.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Davie Drap.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHide and Seek (2)\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--London.\r\n\r\n    I.

When it is hidden, they are\r\ncalled to find it by one of the above rhymes being sung or said. The\r\nsearchers are enabled more readily to find the hidden article by being\r\ntold \"hot,\" \"very hot,\" \"scorching,\" \"burning,\" or \"cold,\" \"very cold,\"\r\nand \"freezing,\" when near to or far from the hidden article. Sometimes\r\nseveral may agree to hide the article, and only one to be the finder. In\r\nthe Penzance game one child is blindfolded, other children hide\r\nsomething, then shout the words. Search is then made for the hidden\r\nobject: when found, the finder in his turn is blindfolded. There appears\r\nto be some mistake in the description of this game.\r\n\r\n\r\nHinch-Pinch\r\n\r\nThe name of an old Christmas game mentioned in _Declaration of Popish\r\nImpostures_, 1603.\r\n\r\n\r\nHinmost o' Three\r\n\r\nA game played on village greens.--Dickinson's _Cumberland Glossary,\r\nSupplement_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHirtschin Hairy\r\n\r\nThe players (boy or girl) cower down on their haunches, \"sit doon\r\ncurriehunkers,\" and hop round and round the floor like a frog, clapping\r\nthe hands first in front and then behind, and crying out, \"Hirtschin\r\nHairy.\" It is sometimes called \"Hairy Hirtschin.\" In Lothian the players\r\ntry to knock each other over by hustling against one another.--Rev.

Each boy in turn is then summoned by another\r\nwho acts as doorkeeper, and asked to guess which lady he imagines has\r\nchosen him for her partner. Should he guess rightly he is allowed to\r\ntake his seat by the lady who has chosen him, while the other girls\r\nloudly clap hands. Should he guess wrongly he is hissed, and sent out of\r\nthe room by the doorkeeper.--Cork, Ireland (Miss Keane).\r\n\r\nAt Long Eaton in Nottinghamshire Miss Youngman records a similar game to\r\nthis, with a rhyme that is probably taken from a popular song or ballad.\r\nThe successful candidate for the girl's choice claims a kiss, but if\r\nunsuccessful he is beaten out of the room with knotted handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitch Jamie; Hitch Jamie, Stride and Loup\r\n\r\nThe boyish play of \"Hop, Step, and Jump.\"--Atkinson's _Cleveland\r\nGlossary_.\r\n\r\nBrockett (_North Country Words_) calls this \"Hitch.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Half-Hammer,\" \"Hick, Step, and Jump.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHitchapagy\r\n\r\nAn undescribed Suffolk game.--Halliwell's _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitchy Cock Ho\r\n\r\nAn undescribed Suffolk game.--Moor's _Suffolk Words_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHity Tity\r\n\r\nThe Somerset name for \"See-Saw.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHoatie, Hots\r\n\r\nWhen a number of boys agree to have a game at the Pearie or peg-top, a\r\ncircle is drawn on the ground, within which all the tops must strike and\r\nspin.

The punishment to which the Hoatie is subjected\r\nconsists in being placed in the ring, while all the boys whose tops ran\r\nfairly have the privilege of striking--or, as it is called, \"deggin\"--it\r\ntill it is either split or struck out of the circle.

The players each have a bent or hooked stick or\r\n\"hockey.\" They take opposite sides. The object of the game is for each\r\nside to drive the ball through their opponents' goal. The goals are\r\neach marked by two poles standing about eight to ten feet apart, and\r\nboundaries are marked at the sides. The ball is placed in the middle of\r\nthe ground. It is started by two players who stand opposite each other,\r\nthe ball lying between their two sticks. They first touch the ground\r\nwith their hockey-sticks, then they touch or strike their opponents'\r\nstick. This is repeated three times. At the third stroke they both try\r\nto hit the ball away. The ball may only be played by a hockey-stick, and\r\na goal is gained when the ball is played between the posts by the\r\nopposing party.--Barnes (A. B. Gomme).\r\n\r\n(_b_) In Ross and Stead's _Holderness Glossary_ this game is described\r\nunder the name of \"Shinnup.\" Robinson (_Mid Yorkshire Glossary_) gives\r\nit under \"Shinnops,\" a youth's game with a ball and stick, heavy at the\r\nstriking end, the player man[oe]uvring to get as many strokes as\r\npossible and to drive the ball distances. \"Shinnoping\" is also used for\r\nthe game in operation. \"Jowling,\" or \"Jowls,\" is given in Robinson's\r\n_Whitby Glossary_, as a game played much the same as \"Hockey.\" \"Baddin\"\r\nis the name given to it in Holland's _Cheshire Glossary_. Another name\r\nis \"Doddart\" (Brockett, _North Country Words_).\r\n\r\n(_c_) An old custom in vogue in bygone days was Rotherham Fair, or what\r\nwas called \"Whipping Toms,\" which took place in the Newarkes every\r\nShrove Tuesday. So soon as the pancake bell rang men and boys assembled\r\nwith sticks having a knob or hook at the end. A wooden ball was thrown\r\ndown, and two parties engaged in striving which could get the ball by\r\nstriking it with their sticks to one end of the Newarke first--those who\r\ndid so were the victors. This game was called \"Shinney,\" or \"Hockey.\"\r\nAbout one o'clock the Whipping Toms appeared on the scene of action.\r\nThese were three men clad in blue smock frocks, with very long waggon\r\nwhips, who were accompanied by three men with small bells. They\r\ncommenced driving the men and boys out of the Newarkes. It was very\r\ndangerous sometimes; they would lash the whip in such a manner round the\r\nlegs of those they were pursuing as to throw them down, which produced\r\nlaughter and shouting. Some would stop, and turn to the whipper and\r\nsay, \"Let's have a pennyworth,\" and he would guard and parry off the\r\nlashes with his shinney stick. When the whipper was successful in\r\nlashing him he demanded his penny, and continued lashing until he paid.\r\nThis was continued until five o'clock, then the game terminated. This\r\nwas suppressed, I believe, in 1847. At that period it was a prevalent\r\nidea that it could not be abolished, as it was connected with an \"old\r\ncharter.\" It is believed in the town that this custom was to commemorate\r\nthe driving out of the Danes from the Newarkes at the time they besieged\r\nLeicester.--Leicester (Robert Hazlewood).\r\n\r\nSee \"Bandy,\" \"Camp,\" \"Football,\" \"Hood,\" \"Hurling.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHoges\r\n\r\n\"The hoges,\" a boy's game played with \"peeries\" (peg-tops).

P. Emslie).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nA number of children stoop down in a row, clasping their hands under\r\ntheir legs. One child stands in front of them, and acts as owner or\r\nseller; another acts as purchaser (fig. 1). The purchaser inquires--\r\n\r\n    Have you any honey pots for sale?\r\n    Yes, plenty; will you walk round and taste them?\r\n\r\nThe purchaser goes round, pretending to taste each one in turn,\r\ninquiring the price and weight; finds fault with several, one being too\r\nsweet and the other not fresh enough, and so on. When one honey pot is\r\ndiscovered to the purchaser's taste, she is lifted by the purchaser and\r\nowner, or by two children who act as weights or scales, and then swung\r\nby her arms backwards and forwards to estimate her weight and price\r\n(fig. 2). As long as the child can keep her hands clasped, so long is\r\nthe swinging kept up; and as many times as they count, so many is the\r\nnumber of pounds she weighs. The seller sometimes said, when each one\r\nwas bought--\r\n\r\n    Take her and bake her,\r\n    And into pies make her,\r\n    And bring her back\r\n    When she is done.\r\n\r\nThey were not brought back, and the \"owner\" had to catch and bring back\r\neach one. When sold, the honey pot is taken to the other side, or \"home\"\r\nof the purchaser. The game goes on till all the honey pots are\r\nsold.--London (A. B. Gomme).\r\n\r\nIn Sporle, a girl clasps her hands under her legs to form a seat, and\r\ntwo others swing her by the arms, saying--\r\n\r\n    Honey pot, honey pot, over the river;\r\n    When the old cat dies you shall have the liver.\r\n\r\n--Miss Matthews.\r\n\r\nIn a version sent by Miss Chase, and told her by a London maidservant,\r\nthe children sit as in \"Hunt the Slipper.\" One steps in a corner out of\r\nearshot; the rest are named \"Gooseberry Tart,\" \"Cherry Tart,\" &c., by\r\nanother, who recalls the child in the corner with--\r\n\r\n    Fool, fool, come to school,\r\n    Pick me out a [cherry tart, as the case may be].\r\n\r\nIf he chooses the wrong one he is told--\r\n\r\n    Go back and learn your A, B, C.\r\n\r\nIf rightly--\r\n\r\n    Take him and bake him,\r\n    And give me a piece\r\n    When he's done.\r\n\r\nThe child is then led off in a squatting position. Later the one who\r\nnamed them pretends tasting, and says, \"Very nice,\" or \"You must be\r\nbaked longer,\" when another squatting walk and wait takes place.\r\n\r\nA version sent by Mr. J. P. Emslie is similar to the other London\r\nversions--\r\n\r\n    \"Buy my fine honey to-day.\r\n    Which shall I buy?\r\n    Taste 'em and try.\r\n\r\nThe child would then go round, pretending to taste, saying, 'Don't like\r\nthat one,' till one was approved. That one was then swung round to the\r\ntune given, the words being--\r\n\r\n    An apple for the king and a pear for the queen,\r\n    And a good jump over the bowling green.\r\n\r\nAt the last bar they swung the child higher and higher, and at the last\r\nnote they swung it as high as they could. I believe the last note in the\r\nmusic should be G, but it was raised to give effect.\"\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the game is called \"Hinnie Pigs,\" and is played as follows.\r\nThe boys sit down in rows, hands locked beneath their hams. Round comes\r\none of them, the honey merchant, who feels those who are sweet and sour,\r\nby lifting them by the arm-pits and giving them three shakes. If they\r\nstand these without the hands unlocking below they are then sweet and\r\nsaleable, fit for being office-bearers of other ploys.--Mactaggart's\r\n_Gallovidian Encyclopædia_.\r\n\r\nIn Ross and Stead's _Holderness Glossary_ this is described as a girls'\r\ngame, in which two carry a third as a pot of honey to market. It is\r\nmentioned by Addy (_Sheffield Glossary_) and by Holland (_Cheshire\r\nGlossary_). Mr. Holland adds, \"If the hands give way before twenty is\r\nreached it is counted a bad honey pot; if not, it is a good one.\"\r\n\r\nIn Dublin the seller sings out--\r\n\r\n    Honey pots, honey pots, all in a row,\r\n    Twenty-five shillings wherever you go--\r\n    Who'll buy my honey pots?\r\n\r\n--Mrs. Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe game is mentioned by a writer in _Blackwood's Magazine_, August\r\n1821, p. 36, as being played in Edinburgh when he was a boy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHood\r\n\r\nA game played at Haxey, in the Isle of Axholme, on the 6th of January.\r\nThe Hood is a piece of sacking, rolled tightly up and well corded, and\r\nwhich weighs about six pounds. This is taken into an open field on the\r\nnorth side of the church, to be contended for by the youths assembled\r\nfor that purpose. When the Hood is about to be thrown up, the\r\nPlough-bullocks or Boggins, as they are called, dressed in scarlet\r\njackets, are placed amongst the crowd at certain distances. Their\r\npersons are sacred, and if amidst the general row the Hood falls into\r\nthe hands of one of them, the sport begins again. The object of the\r\nperson who seizes the Hood is to carry off the prize to some\r\npublic-house in the town, where he is rewarded with such liquor as he\r\nchooses to call for. This pastime is said to have been instituted by the\r\nMowbrays, and that the person who furnished the Hood did so as a tenure\r\nby which he held some land under the lord. How far this tradition may be\r\nfounded on fact I do not know, but no person now acknowledges to hold\r\nany land by that tenure.--Stonehouse's _Isle of Axholme_, p. 291.\r\n\r\nW. J. Woolhouse (_Notes and Queries_, 2nd series, v. 95) says when the\r\nHood is thrown up by the Chief of the Boggons or by the officials, it\r\nbecomes the object of the villagers to get the Hood to their own\r\nvillage, the other eleven men, called Boggons, being stationed at the\r\ncorners and sides of the field, to prevent, if possible, its being\r\nthrown out of the field; and should it chance to fall into any of their\r\nhands, it is \"boggoned,\" and forthwith returned to the chief, who again\r\nthrows it up, as at the commencement of the game. The next day is\r\noccupied by the Boggons going round the villages singing as waits, and\r\nthey are regaled with hot furmenty; from some they get coppers given\r\nthem, and from others a small measure of wheat. The day after that they\r\nassume the character of Plough-bullocks, and at a certain part of\r\nWestwood-side they \"smoke the Fool\"--that is, straw is brought by those\r\nwho like, and piled in a heap, a rope being tied or slung over the\r\nbranches of the tree next to the pile of straw; the other end of the\r\nrope is fastened round the waist of the Fool, and he is drawn up and\r\nfire is put to the straw, the Fool being swung to and fro through the\r\nsmoke until he is well-nigh choked, after which he goes round and\r\ncollects whatever the spectators choose to give him. The sport is then\r\nat an end till the next year. The land left by Lady Mowbray was forty\r\nacres, which are known by the name of \"Hoodlands,\" and the Boggons'\r\ndresses and the Hood are made from its proceeds.\r\n\r\nIn the contiguous parish of Epworth a similar game is played under the\r\nsame name, but with some variations. The Hood is not here carried away\r\nfrom the field, but to certain goals, against which it is struck three\r\ntimes and then declared free. This is called \"wyking\" the Hood, which is\r\nafterwards thrown up again for a fresh game.--_Notes and Queries_, 6th\r\nseries, vii. 148.\r\n\r\nSee \"Football,\" \"Hockey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHoodle-cum-blind\r\n\r\nName for \"Blind Man's Buff.\"--Baker's _Northamptonshire Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoodman Blind\r\n\r\nName for \"Blind Man's Buff.\" Mentioned in _Hamlet_, iii. 4; _Merry Devil\r\nof Edmonton_; and _Wise Women of Hogsden_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHooper's Hide\r\n\r\nName for \"Blind Man's Buff.\"--Nares' _Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHop-crease\r\n\r\nThe game of \"Hop-scotch.\"--Halliwell's _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHop-frog\r\n\r\nThe players bend as though about to sit on a _very low_ stool, then\r\nspring about with their hands resting on their knees.--Dorsetshire\r\n(_Folk-lore Journal_, vii. 234).\r\n\r\nMiss Peacock says that a game called \"Hop-frog over the Dog\" is played\r\nat Stixwould, Lincolnshire, in the same way as \"Leap-frog.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Curcuddie,\" \"Cutch-a-cutchoo,\" \"Harie Hutcheon,\" \"Hirtschin Hairy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHop-score\r\n\r\nGame of \"Hop-scotch.\"--Hunter's _Glossary of Hallamshire_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHop-scotch\r\n\r\nA game, the object of which is to eject a stone, slate, or \"dump\" out of\r\na form linearly marked on the ground in different directions, by hopping\r\nwithout touching any of the lines.--Halliwell's _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\nIn the plan (fig. 8) the players first lay the stone on the back of the\r\nhand, and _walk_ through the plan, stepping into each division, throw it\r\nup and catch it. Then the stone is _thrown_ back from No. 7 outside No.\r\n1. Now it is placed on the toe, and the child walks through again,\r\nthrowing up the foot when out, to catch the stone in the hand. Another\r\nway, done on the same plan, is for the player to place the stone in No.\r\n1, leave it there, and hop into each division and back, then place it in\r\nNo. 2, and repeat the hopping, and so on through all the figures. There\r\nis no _kicking_ of the stone, as is usual in London.--Roxton, St. Neots\r\n(Miss Lumley).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nFig. 2.\r\n\r\nFig. 3.\r\n\r\nFig. 4.\r\n\r\nFig. 5.\r\n\r\nFig. 6.\r\n\r\nFig. 7.\r\n\r\nFig. 8.\r\n\r\nFig. 9.\r\n\r\nFig. 10.]\r\n\r\nFrom Crockham Hill, Kent, Miss Chase sends four versions. In the first\r\nplan (fig. 1) the game is:--Throw stone into No. 1. Hop from No. 1 to\r\nNo. 5 and back. Then pick it up. So on successively. After having thrown\r\nit into No. 5, begin to reverse by throwing stone into No. 1 while\r\nstanding at No. 5--return with it on your thumb. Throw into No.\r\n2--return with stone on your eye. Throw into No. 3--return with stone in\r\nyour palm. Throw into No. 4--return with stone on your head. Throw into\r\nNo. 5--return with stone on your back. In each case, upon reaching the\r\ngoal without dropping it, throw up and catch it as it falls.\r\n\r\nIn the second plan (fig. 2) the game is:--Throw stone into No. 1. Pick\r\nit up. Hop, not touching lines, from No. 1 to No. 4, and \"out.\" Throw\r\nstone into No. 2. Do as before. And so successively into Nos. 3 and 4.\r\nNext balance stone on shoe, then on the palm of hand, then on the back\r\nof hand, then on the head, then on the shoulder, then on the eye (tilt\r\nhead back to keep it from falling). In each case walk round once with it\r\nso balanced and catch at end.\r\n\r\nIn the third plan (fig. 3) the game is:--Put pebble in No. 1. Pick up.\r\nHop, having one foot in No. 2 and the other in No. 3. Step into No. 4.\r\nHop, having one foot in No. 5 and the other in No. 6. Jump round. Go\r\nback as you came. Then with stone on shoe, walk through the figure, kick\r\nit up and catch at the close. Place stone on eyelid; walk through the\r\nsame figure, dropping it off into hand at close. This is called\r\n\"jumping.\"\r\n\r\nIn the fourth plan (fig. 4) the game is:--Throw stone into No. 1. Pick\r\nit up. Hop from No. 1 to No. 8, not touching lines. So successively into\r\nNos. 2, 3, 4, &c. Walk into No. 1 with stone on foot, and out at No. 8.\r\nKick it up and catch it. The same with stone on thumb. Toss it up and\r\ncatch. Again with stone on your back. Straighten up, let it slide into\r\nyour hand.\r\n\r\nIn Stead's _Holderness Glossary_, this is described as a boys' or girls'\r\ngame, in which the pavement is chalked with numbered crossed lines, and\r\na pebble or piece of crockery is propelled onward by the foot, the\r\nperformer hopping on one leg, the number reached on the chalk-line being\r\nscored to him or her. At Whitby it is called \"Pally-ully,\" and played\r\nwith rounded pieces of pot the size of a penny. Divisions are chalked on\r\nthe pavement, and the \"pally-ullies\" are impelled within the lines by a\r\nhop on one leg, and a side shuffle with the same foot (_Whitby\r\nGlossary_). It is sometimes called \"Tray-Trip.\" Atkinson describes the\r\nfigure as oblong, with many angular compartments (_Cleveland Glossary_).\r\nJamieson defines \"Beds\" as \"Hop-scotch,\" a game denominated from the\r\nform, sometimes by strangers called squares. In Aberdeen the spaces\r\nmarked out are sometimes circular.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lincoln sends a diagram of the game from Dublin (fig. 6). Addy\r\n(_Sheffield Glossary_) under the name of \"Hop-score\" says it is a game\r\nin which certain squares are drawn or _scored_ on the ground. The piece\r\nof stone which is pushed with the foot is called the \"scotch.\" Elworthy\r\n(_West Somerset Words_) says a piece of tile is kicked over lines and\r\ninto squares marked on the ground. It is called \"Hickety-Hackety,\" also\r\n\"Huckety.\" Cope (_Hampshire Glossary_) says it is played in Hants. Moor\r\n(_Suffolk Words and Phrases_) describes this game under the name of\r\n\"Scotch-hob,\" by hopping and kicking a bit of tile from bed to bed of a\r\ndiagram which he gives (fig. 5, here printed). Brockett (_North Country\r\nWords_) calls it \"Beds.\" Barnes (_Dorset Glossary_) only says \"hopping\r\nover a parallelogram of scotches or chalk-lines on the ground.\" F. H.\r\nLow, in _Strand Magazine_, ii. 516, says the divisions are respectively\r\nnamed onesie, twosie, threesie, foursie, and puddings. It is called\r\n\"Hop-bed\" at Stixwold in Lincolnshire (Miss Peacock), \"Hop-score\" in\r\nYorkshire (Halliwell, l.c.), and \"Hitchibed\" in Cleveland, Yorks.\r\n(_Glossary of Cleveland Words_). Strutt describes it (_Sports_, p. 383);\r\nand Wood's _Modern Playmate_, p. 32, gives a diagram similar to one seen\r\non a London pavement by A. B. Gomme (see fig. 7). Mr. Emslie has sent me\r\nfigs. 9 and 10, also from London streets. Newell (_Games_, p. 188)\r\nspeaks of it as a well-known game in America.\r\n\r\nMr. Elworthy (_West Somerset Words_) says, \"Several of these (diagrams\r\nmarked on the ground) are still to be seen, scratched on the ancient\r\npavement of the Roman Forum.\" Mr. J. W. Crombie says, \"The game of\r\n'Hop-scotch' was one of considerable antiquity, having been known in\r\nEngland for more than two centuries, and it was played all over Europe\r\nunder different names. Signor Pitré's solar explanation of its origin\r\nappeared improbable to him, for not only was the evidence in its favour\r\nextremely weak, but it would require the original number of divisions in\r\nthe figure to have been twelve instead of seven, which was the number\r\nindicated by a considerable body of evidence. It would seem more\r\nprobable that the game at one time represented the progress of the soul\r\nfrom earth to heaven through various intermediate states, the name given\r\nto the last court being most frequently paradise or an equivalent, such\r\nas crown or glory, while the names of the other courts corresponded with\r\nthe eschatological ideas prevalent in the early days of Christianity.\"\r\nSome such game existed before Christianity, and Mr. Crombie considered\r\nthat it had been derived from several ancient games. Possibly the\r\nstrange myths of the labyrinths might have had something to do with\r\n\"Hop-scotch,\" and a variety of the game played in England, under the\r\nname of \"Round Hop-scotch,\" was almost identical with a game described\r\nby Pliny as being played by the boys of his day. Mr. Crombie also said\r\nhe \"believed that the early Christians adopted the general idea of the\r\nancient game, but they not only converted it into an allegory of heaven,\r\nwith Christian beliefs and Christian names; they Christianised the\r\nfigure also; they abandoned the heathen labyrinth and replaced it by the\r\nform of the Basilicon, the early Christian church, dividing it into\r\nseven parts, as they believed heaven to be divided, and placing\r\nparadise, the inner sanctum of heaven, in the position of the altar, the\r\ninner sanctum of their earthly church.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Hap the Beds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHop, Step, and Jump\r\n\r\nSee \"Half-Hammer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHornie\r\n\r\nA game among children in which one of the company runs after the rest\r\nhaving his hands clasped and his thumbs pushed out before him in\r\nresemblance of horns. The first person whom he touches with his thumbs\r\nbecomes his property, joins hands with him, and aids in attempting to\r\ncatch the rest: and so on until they are all made captives. Those who\r\nare at liberty still cry out, \"Hornie, Hornie.\"--Lothian (Jamieson).\r\n\r\nJamieson says: \"Whether this play be a vestige of the very ancient\r\ncustom of assuming the appearance and skins of animals, especially in\r\nthe sports of Yule, or might be meant to symbolise the exertions made by\r\nthe devil (often called 'Hornie') in making sinful man his prey, and\r\nemploying fellow-men as his coadjutors in this work, I cannot pretend\r\nto determine.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Hunt the Staigie,\" \"Whiddy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHornie Holes\r\n\r\nA game in which four play, a principal and an assistant on each side. A.\r\nstands with his assistant at one hole, and throws what is called a Cat\r\n(a piece of stick, and frequently a sheep's horn), with the design of\r\nmaking it alight in another hole at some distance, at which B. and his\r\nassistant stand ready to drive it aside. The bat or driver is a rod\r\nresembling a walking-stick.\r\n\r\nThe following unintelligible rhyme is repeated by a player on the one\r\nside, while they on the other are gathering in the Cats, and is attested\r\nby old people as of great antiquity:--\r\n\r\n        Jock, Speak, and Sandy,\r\n           W' a' their lousy train\r\n        Round about by Errinborra,\r\n           We'll never meet again.\r\n        Gae head 'im, gae hang 'im,\r\n           Gae lay 'im in the sea;\r\n        A' the birds o' the air\r\n           Will bear him companee.\r\n    With a nig-nag, widdy- [_or_ worry-] bag,\r\n    And an e'endown trail, trail;\r\n                   Quoth he.\r\n\r\n--Jamieson.\r\n\r\nThe game is also called \"Kittie-cat.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Cat and Dog,\" \"Cudgel,\" \"Tip-cat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHorns\r\n\r\n\"A' Horns to the Lift,\" a game of young people. A circle is formed round\r\na table, and all placing their forefingers on the table, one cries, \"A'\r\nhorns to the lift! Cat's horns upmost!\" If on this any one lift his\r\nfinger, he owes a wad, as cats have no horns. In the same manner, the\r\nperson who does not raise his fingers when a horned animal is named is\r\nsubjected to a forfeit.--Jamieson.\r\n\r\n\r\nHot Cockles\r\n\r\nAt Sheffield a boy is chosen for a Stump, and stands with his back\r\nagainst a wall. Another boy bends his back as in \"Leapfrog,\" and puts\r\nhis head against the Stump. The cap of the boy who bends down is then\r\ntaken off, and put upon his back upside down. Then each of the other\r\nboys who are playing puts the first finger of his right hand into the\r\ncap. When all the fingers are put into the cap, these lines are sung--\r\n\r\n    The wind blows east, the wind blows west,\r\n    The wind blows o'er the cuckoo's nest.\r\n    Where is this poor man to go?\r\n    Over yond cuckoo's hill I O.\r\n\r\nThen the boy whose back is bent jumps up, and the others run away crying\r\nout, \"Hot cockles.\" The boy who is caught by the one whose back was\r\nfirst bent has to bend his back next time, and so on.--S. O. Addy.\r\n\r\nAt Cork a handkerchief is tied over the eyes of one of the company, who\r\nthen lays his head on a chair, and places his hand on his back with the\r\npalm uppermost. Any of the party come behind him and give him a slap on\r\nhis hand, he in the meantime trying to discover whose hand it is that\r\nstrikes.--Miss Keane.\r\n\r\n\"Hot Cockles\" is an old game, practised especially at Christmas. One boy\r\nsits down, and another, who is blindfolded, kneels and lays his head on\r\nhis knee, placing at the same time his open hand on his own back. He\r\nthen cries, \"Hot cockles, hot!\" Another then strikes his open hand, and\r\nthe sitting boy asks who strikes. If the boy guessed wrongly, he made a\r\nforfeit; but if rightly, he was released.--_Notes and Queries_, 4th\r\nseries, ix. 262.\r\n\r\nThe sport is noticed by Gay--\r\n\r\n    As at hot-cockles once I laid me down,\r\n    I felt the weighty hand of many a clown;\r\n    Buxoma gave a gentle tap, and I\r\n    Quick rose and read soft mischief in her eye.\r\n\r\nHalliwell describes it rather differently. The blindfolded boy lies down\r\non his face, and, being struck, must guess who it is that hit him. A\r\ngood part of the fun consisted in the hardness of the slaps, which were\r\ngenerally given on the throne of honour. He quotes from a MS. play as\r\nfollows--\r\n\r\n    It is edicted that every Grobian shall play at Bamberye hott cockles\r\n      at the four festivals.\r\n    Indeed a verye usefull sport, but lately much neglected to the\r\n      mollefieinge of the flesh.\r\n\r\n--Halliwell's _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNares' _Glossary_ also contains quotations from works of 1639, 1653, and\r\n1697 which illustrate the game. Mr. Addy says \"that this game as played\r\nin Sheffield is quite different from that described under the same title\r\nin Halliwell's _Dictionary_. Aubrey (p. 30) speaks of 'Hot Cockles' as a\r\ngame played at funerals in Yorkshire, and the lines here given show that\r\nthis was the game. The lines--\r\n\r\n    Where is this poor man to go?\r\n    Over yond cuckoo's hill I O,\r\n\r\nembodies the popular belief that the soul winged its way like a bird,\r\nand they remind one of the passing of the soul over Whinny Moor (see\r\nfuneral dirge in Aubrey's _Remains of Gentilisme_, p. 31). Grimm\r\nmentions the cuckoo hill (Gauchsberg). He says, 'Originally in\r\nGauchsberg the bird himself may very well have been meant in a mystic\r\nsense which has fallen dark to us now' (_Teut. Myth._, ii. 681). We\r\nknow, too, the old belief that the cuckoo tells children how many years\r\nthey have to live. These lines are also sometimes said, in addition to\r\nthose given above--\r\n\r\n    Elder belder, limber lock,\r\n    Three wives in a clock;\r\n    Sit and sing, and call a spring,\r\n    O-u-t spells out.\r\n\r\nThe boy who bends down is supposed to be undergoing a great penalty.\"\r\nStrutt (_Sports_, p. 394) describes this game, and gives an illustration\r\nwhich is here reproduced from the original MSS. in the Bodleian.\r\n\r\nThis game may have originated from a custom at funerals of practising\r\nspells for the safe and speedy passage of the departing spirit to its\r\ndestination, or from divination mysteries to foretell who would be the\r\nnext among the mourners to follow the dead body to the grave. The spirit\r\nof prophecy was believed to exist in a dying person. See \"Handy\r\nCroopen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many Miles to Babylon\r\n\r\n    I.

Of the first Chambers and Mactaggart practically give the\r\nsame account. The latter says, \"Two of the swiftest boys are placed\r\nbetween two 'doons' or places of safety; these, perhaps, are two hundred\r\nyards distant. All the other boys stand in one of these places or doons,\r\nwhen the two fleet youths come forward and address them with the rhyme.\r\nWhen out, they run in hopes to get to Babylon or the other doon, but\r\nmany get not near that place before they are caught by the runners, who\r\n'taens' them, that is, lay their hands upon their heads, when they are\r\nnot allowed to run any more in that game, that is, until they all be\r\ntaened or taken.\"\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk game seems to resemble the Scotch, though in a much less\r\ncomplete form. Miss Matthews describes it as follows:--\"A line of\r\nchildren is formed, and the two standing opposite it sing the questions,\r\nto which the line reply; then the two start off running in any direction\r\nthey please, and the others try to catch them.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe second method of playing is best described by the Rev. Walter\r\nGregor, from the Nairn game, which is known as \"The Gates of Babylon.\"\r\nMr. Gregor writes as follows:--\"This game may be played either by boys\r\nor girls. Two of the players join hands, and stand face to face, with\r\ntheir hands in front as if forming a gate. Each of these has a secret\r\nname. The other players form themselves into a line by clasping each\r\nother round the waist from behind. They go up to the two that form the\r\ngate, and the leader asks the first question, as in version No. 2. The\r\ndialogue then proceeds to the end. The two then lift their arms as high\r\nas they can, still joined, and the line of players passes through. All\r\nat once the two bring their arms down on one and make him (or her)\r\nprisoner. The prisoner is asked in a whisper, so as not to disclose the\r\nsecret name, which of the two is to be chosen. The one so captured takes\r\nhis (or her) stand behind the one chosen. The same process is gone\r\nthrough till all the players are taken captive, and have stationed\r\nthemselves behind the one or the other of the two forming the gate. The\r\nlast one of the line goes through three times. The first time the word\r\n'breakfast' is pronounced; the second time 'dinner;' and the third time\r\n'supper.' The player then chooses a side. The two sides have then a tug\r\nof war. The game ends at this point with girls. With boys the conquered\r\nhave to run the gauntlet. The victors range themselves in two lines,\r\neach boy with his cap or handkerchief tightly plaited in his hand, and\r\npelt with all their might the vanquished as they run between the lines.\r\nThe boys of Nairn call this running of the gauntlet, 'through fire an'\r\nwatter.'\"\r\n\r\nThe method of playing the Warwick, Fernham, and Louth versions is\r\npractically the same. The children stand in half-circle beginning with\r\nthe two tallest at either end. All clasp hands. The two at one end\r\nquestion those at the other end alternately (fig. 1). At the last line\r\nthe two that have been answering hold their hands up to form a bridge,\r\nand all the others thread through, still holding hands (the bridge\r\nadvancing slowly) (fig. 2). The Louth version is also sometimes played\r\nas \"Oranges and Lemons.\" This is also the case with the Belfast, South\r\nShields, Ellesmere, and Dublin versions. Miss Burne also gives a second\r\nmethod of playing this game at Ellesmere: she says, \"The whole number of\r\nplayers stand in two rows facing each other, each player joining hands\r\nwith the one opposite. The pair at the lower end parley with the pair at\r\nthe top, and then run under the extended arms of the others, receiving\r\nthumps on the back as they go, till they reach the upper end, and become\r\nthe top couple in their turn.\" The Hanbury version is played in a\r\nsimilar way. Two lines stand close together holding handkerchiefs\r\nacross. The questions are asked and answered by the top and bottom\r\nplayers. Then two children run under the line of handkerchiefs. The\r\nDorset version is played by as many as like standing, two and two,\r\nopposite each other, each of them taking with the right hand the right\r\nhand of the other; then the two that are the King and Queen say or sing\r\nthe first question, to which the others reply, and the dialogue ends in\r\nthis manner. Then all the other pairs hold up their hands as high as\r\nthey can, and the King and Queen run through the archway and back again,\r\nand so on with the next pair, and other pairs in turn. The Isle of Man\r\nversion is played, Mr. Moore says, the same as other \"Thread the Needle\"\r\ngames.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The game is evidently dramatic in form, and perhaps is\r\nillustrative of some fact of history, such as the toll upon merchandise\r\nentering a walled town. The changes in the words of the different\r\nversions are not very great, but they show the influence of modern\r\nhistory upon the game. The appearance of King George evidently points to\r\nthe date when it was frequently played, though the older versions are\r\ndoubtless those in which his Majesty does not do duty. Mactaggart has\r\nthe following quaint note which perhaps may supply the origin, though it\r\nseems a far cry to the Crusaders:--\"This sport has something methinks of\r\nantiquity in it; it seemeth to be a pantomime of some scenes played off\r\nin the time of the Crusades. 'King and Queen o' Cantilon' evidently must\r\nbe King and Queen of Caledon, but slightly changed by time. Then Babylon\r\nin the rhyme, the way they had to wander and hazard being caught by the\r\ninfidels, all speak as to the foundation of the game\" (Mactaggart's\r\n_Gallovidian Encyclopædia_).\r\n\r\nIn the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for December 1849, in a review of the\r\n_Life of Shirley_, it is stated that in many parts of England the old\r\ngame of \"Thread the Needle\" is played to the following words, which\r\nrefer to the gate of the city of Hebron, known as the \"needle's eye.\"\r\n\r\n    How many miles to Hebron?\r\n      Three score and ten.\r\n    Shall I be there by midnight?\r\n      Yes, and back again.\r\n           Then thread the needle, &c.\r\n\r\nThe game is also described in _Notes and Queries_, iv. 141, as played in\r\nthe same way as above, and the writer adds there are subsequent\r\nevolutions by which each couple becomes in succession the eye of the\r\nneedle.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowly\r\n\r\nA street game played by boys in a town, one of them hiding behind a wall\r\nor house-end, and crying \"Howly\" to the seekers.--Atkinson's _Cleveland\r\nGlossary_.\r\n\r\nSee \"Hide and Seek.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHuckie-buckie down the Brae\r\n\r\nChildren in Lothian have a sport in which they slide down a hill,\r\nsitting on their hunkers (Jamieson). The well-known custom at Greenwich\r\nis probably the same game, and there are examples at Tumbling Hill, a\r\nfew miles from Exeter, at May Pole Hill, near Gloucester, and other\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nHuckle-bones\r\n\r\nHolloway (_Dict. of Provincialisms_) says that the game is called\r\n\"Huckle-bones\" in East Sussex and \"Dibs\" in West Sussex. Parish (_Dict.\r\nof Sussex Dialect_) mentions that huckle-bones, the small bone found in\r\nthe joint of the knee of a sheep, are used by children for playing the\r\ngame of \"Dibs;\" also Peacock's _Manley and Corringham Glossary_. Barnes\r\n(_Dorset Glossary_) says, \"A game of toss and catch, played mostly by\r\ntwo with five dibs or huckle-bones of a leg of mutton, or round pieces\r\nof tile or slate.\" Halliwell's description is clearly wrong. He says it\r\nwas a game formerly played by throwing up the hip-bone of some animal,\r\non one side of which was a head of Venus and on the other that of a dog.\r\nHe who turned up the former was the winner (_Dictionary_). Miss J.\r\nBarker writes that \"Huckle-bones\" is played in Hexham; and Professor\r\nAttwell (Barnes) played the game as a boy, and is still a proficient in\r\nit; he played it recently for my benefit with his set of real\r\nhuckle-bones (A. B. Gomme); and see _Notes and Queries_, 9th ser., iv.\r\n378, 379.\r\n\r\nThe figures or sets are practically the same as those described under\r\n\"Fivestones.\" The game is very ancient. In the _Sanctuarie of\r\nSalvation_, &c., translated from the Latin of Levinus Lemnius by Henry\r\nKinder (8vo, London, printed by H. Singleton), p. 144, we read, \"These\r\nbones are called 'huckle-bones' or 'coytes.'\" For further information\r\nrelating to this game, as played by the ancients, the reader may consult\r\n_Joannis Meursii Ludibunda, sive de Ludis Græcorum, Liber singularis_\r\n(8vo, Lugd. Bat. 1625), p. 7, and _Dan. Souterii Palamedes_, p. 81; but\r\nmore particularly, _I Tali ed altri Strumenti lusori degli antichi\r\nRomani, discritti da Francesco de 'Ficoroni_, 4to, Rom. 1734. Against\r\nthe suggestion that the modern game is derived directly from the\r\nRomans, is the fact that it is known in countries never traversed or\r\noccupied by the Romans. Thus Dr. Clarke, in his _Travels in Russia_,\r\n1810, p. 106, says: \"In all the villages and towns from Moscow to\r\nWoronetz, as in other parts of Russia, are seen boys, girls, and\r\nsometimes even old men, playing with the joint-bones of sheep. This game\r\nis called 'Dibbs' by the English. It is of very remote antiquity; for I\r\nhave seen it very beautifully represented on Grecian vases; particularly\r\non a vase in the collection of the late Sir William Hamilton, where a\r\nfemale figure appeared most gracefully delineated kneeling upon one\r\nknee, with her right arm extended, the palm downwards, and the bones\r\nranged along the back of her hand and arm. In this manner the Russians\r\nplay the game.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Dalies,\" \"Fivestones.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHummie\r\n\r\nThe game otherwise called \"Shinty.\" The shinty or hummie is played by a\r\nset of boys in two divisions who attempt to drive with curved sticks a\r\nball, or what is more common, part of the vertebral bone of a sheep, in\r\nopposite directions (_Blackwood's Magazine_, August 1821, p. 36). If one\r\nof the adverse party happens to stand or run among his opponents, they\r\ncall out \"Hummie, keep on your own side.\"--Jamieson.\r\n\r\n\r\nHundreds\r\n\r\nA game at marbles, which is carried on until one of the players scores\r\n100 or some other high number agreed upon. Any number can play, but it\r\nis best described for two players, A. and B. First the players taw up to\r\na hole; if both get in, they repeat the process until one is left out,\r\nsay B.; then A. counts 10. Should both fail, the nearest goes first. He\r\nmay now lay his taw about the hole or fire at the other, on hitting\r\nwhich he counts another 10. He now goes for the hole again, and failing,\r\nlies where he happens to stop. If he misses, B. from his present\r\nposition tries to get into the hole, and failing, lies still; but if he\r\nreaches the hole, he counts 10, and proceeds as A. had done. The one who\r\nfirst gets the 100 (or other number) now goes in for his \"pizings,\"\r\nwhich performance takes place thus:--The loser, so far, is lying about,\r\nand the winner goes back to \"drakes,\" and again tries to lodge in the\r\nhole; and if he succeeds, the game is up. If not, he lies still, and the\r\nloser tries for the hole; if he gets in he counts another 10, or if he\r\nshould succeed in hitting the winner he scores his adversary's 100 to\r\nhis own number, and then goes on for his \"pizings\" as the other had\r\ndone. In failure of either securing the game thus, the process is\r\nrepeated at \"drakes.\" When, however, the one who is on for his \"pizings\"\r\nmanages to taw into the hole, the game is concluded.--Easther's\r\n_Almondbury and Huddersfield Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHunt the Hare\r\n\r\nA game among children, played on the ice as well as in the fields\r\n(Brockett's _North Country Words_). Strutt (_Sports_, p. 381) says \"Hunt\r\nthe Hare\" is the same game as \"Hunt the Fox.\" In this game one boy is\r\npermitted to run out, and having law given to him--that is, being\r\npermitted to go to a certain distance from his comrades before they\r\npursue him--their object is to take him, if possible, before he can\r\nreturn home.\r\n\r\nSee \"Hare and Hounds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHunt the Slipper\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Lancashire (Mrs. Harley).\r\n\r\nAll the players but one sit on the floor in a circle with their legs\r\ncrossed (Turkish fashion), one acting as Chief, all pretending to work\r\nat making or mending shoes. The other player brings a slipper to the\r\nChief Cobbler, and desires it to be mended, saying--\r\n\r\n    Cobbler, cobbler, mend my shoe,\r\n    Get it done by half-past two.\r\n\r\nThe child walks away, and returns in a few moments and asks whether the\r\nshoe is ready. The Cobbler says, \"Not quite; call again in an hour's\r\ntime,\" or makes any other excuse which occurs to him. When the child\r\ncalls again, she is told it has been sent home. After several pretences\r\nthe child declares an intention to search for it. The Cobblers in the\r\nring then all place their hands under their knees, and pass the slipper\r\nsecretly from one to another in such a way as to prevent the owner of\r\nthe shoe getting it for some time. The Cobbler from whom the slipper is\r\ntaken becomes the owner next time (Barnes, A. B. Gomme). In the\r\nNottinghamshire version (Miss Peacock) the rhyme is--\r\n\r\n    Cobbler, cobbler, mend my shoe,\r\n    Give it a stitch and that will do.\r\n\r\nVersions from Wakefield, Liphook, Ellesmere, and other places are\r\npractically the same as the Barnes game, but Mr. Udal gives an\r\nelaboration of the Dorsetshire game in the _Folk-lore Journal_, vii.\r\n238. One Lancashire version (Miss Dendy) reverses the characters by\r\nmaking the Cobbler run round the ring, and the children requiring the\r\nshoe to be mended, call out, \"Blackie, come mend my slipper.\" Mrs.\r\nHarley, in another Lancashire version, gives the words sung to the tune\r\nprinted as--\r\n\r\n    Pass on, pass on, passy on the slipper;\r\n    The best fun we ever had was passing on the slipper.\r\n\r\nHolloway (_Dict. of Provincialisms_) says this game was well known in\r\nSomerset, Hants, Sussex, but now is almost out of fashion. He describes\r\nit as being played without words. The child who has to find the shoe\r\nstands in the centre of the circle. The chief amusement arises from the\r\none in the circle who has the slipper striking the one who stands up\r\n(the searcher) while he or she is steadily looking for it in an opposite\r\ndirection. Strutt (_Sports_, p. 387) also describes this game.\r\n\r\n\r\nHunt the Staigie\r\n\r\nA boys' game. One is chosen to be the Staigie (little stallion). The\r\nother players scatter themselves over the playground. The Staigie locks\r\nhis fingers into each other. He then repeats the words--\r\n\r\n    Hunt the Staigie,\r\n    Huntie, untie, staige,\r\n    Ailleman, ailleman, aigie,\r\n\r\nand rushes off with his hands locked, and tries to touch one of the\r\nplayers. He must not unlock his hands till he has caught one. When he\r\nhas captured one, the two join hands and hunt for another. When another\r\nis caught, he joins the two. This goes on till all are hunted\r\ndown.--Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSee \"Chickidy Hand,\" \"Whiddy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHunting\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Earls Heaton (Herbert Hardy).\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Epworth (C. C. Bell).\r\n\r\n    I.

O have you seen the Shah,\r\n           O have you seen the Shah?\r\n           He lights his pipe on a star-light night,\r\n           O have you seen the Shah?\r\n           For a-hunting we will go,\r\n           A-hunting we will go;\r\n           We'll catch a fox and put him in a box,\r\n           A-hunting we will go.\r\n\r\n--Epworth, Doncaster (C. C. Bell).\r\n\r\n(_b_) The players march two by two, all singing. The first pair let go\r\nhands, separate, and skip widely apart, still singing. Gradually, in\r\nthis manner, two separate lines are formed, until, following each other\r\nand singing, the pairs come together again, join hands, and march and\r\nsing in couplets linked.\r\n\r\nThe Bath game is played by the children standing in two rows facing each\r\nother, and clapping hands and singing the verse. At the same time the\r\ntwo children facing each other at the top of the lines join hands and\r\ntrip down and up between the lines. Their hands are unclasped, and the\r\ntwo children run down the outside of the lines, one running on each\r\nside, and meet at the bottom of the lines, where they stand. The two\r\nchildren now standing at the top proceed in the same way: this is\r\ncontinued until all the children have done the same. A ring is then\r\nformed, when the children again clap and sing. Any number can play at\r\nthis game.\r\n\r\nIn the Epworth version the children range themselves in double rank at\r\none end of the room or playground, and march down to the other end hand\r\nin hand. At the bottom they loose hands and divide, the first rank\r\nturning right, the second left, and march back in two single files to\r\nthe other end again, where they re-form as at first, and repeat their\r\nman[oe]uvre, singing the verses alternately.\r\n\r\nThe Lincolnshire game is played by the children walking two and two in a\r\ncircle round one of their companions, singing. The players then stand\r\nfacing the child in the centre, and place their hands on their partners'\r\nshoulders. After the lines are sung the centre child cries out, \"Halt!\r\nShoulder arms! Fire!\" at which words each child kisses his partner. If\r\nthe commander sees any one hesitate, or avoid kissing, he runs forward\r\nand takes the defaulter's place, leaving him to fill the middle\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nSimilar versions are played at Earls Heaton (Mr. Hardy), Forest of Dean\r\n(Miss Matthews), Ellesmere (Burne, _Shropshire Folk-lore_, p. 574),\r\nDerbyshire (_Folk-lore Journal_, i. 386).\r\n\r\n\r\nHurling\r\n\r\nA game played with a ball. The players are divided into two equal\r\nparties, each of which tries to secure and keep the ball in their\r\npossession. The prize is a ball made of cork, covered with\r\nsilver.--Courtney's _West Cornwall Glossary_.\r\n\r\nIn Taylor's _Antiquitates Curiosæ_, p. 144, it is stated:--\"The game of\r\nhurling consisted in throwing or hurling a ball of wood about three\r\ninches in diameter, and covered with plated silver, sometimes gilt. On\r\nthe ball was frequently a Cornish motto allusive to the game, and\r\nsignifying that fair play was best. Success depended on catching the\r\nball dexterously when dealt, and conveying it away through all the\r\nopposition of the adverse party, or, if that was impossible, to throw it\r\ninto the hands of a partner, who, in his turn, was to exert his utmost\r\nefforts to convey it to his own goal, which was often three or four\r\nmiles distant from that of his adversaries.\"\r\n\r\nT. Durfey's _Collin's Walk through London_, 1690, p. 192, says: \"Hurling\r\nis an ancient sport us'd to this day in the countys of Cornwall and\r\nDevon, when once a year the hardy young fellows of each county meet; and\r\na cork ball thinly plated with silver being thrown up between 'em, they\r\nrun, bustle, and fight for it, to the witty dislocating of many a\r\nshrew'd neck, or for the sport of telling how bravely their arms or legs\r\ncame to be broke, when they got home.\" It is fully described by Carew\r\nin his _Survey of Cornwall_, 1602, p. 73.\r\n\r\nIt is also a very ancient Irish game, and Mr. Kinahan says: \"Many places\r\nare called after it: such as, Killahurla, the hurlers' church;\r\nGortnahurla, the field of the hurlers; Greenanahurla, the sunny place of\r\nthe hurlers; this, however, is now generally corrupted into\r\nhurling-green. The hurling-green where the famous match was played by\r\nthe people of Wexford against those of Cather (now divided into the\r\ncounties of Carlow and Wicklow), and where the former got the name of\r\nyellow bellies, from the colour of the scarfs they wore round their\r\nwaist, is a sunny flat on the western side of North Wicklow Gap, on the\r\nroad from Gorey to Trinnahely. There are also many other different names\r\nthat record the game.\"--_Folk-lore Journal_, ii. 266.\r\n\r\nSee \"Bandy,\" \"Camp,\" \"Football,\" \"Hockey,\" \"Hood,\" \"Shinty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHurly-burly\r\n\r\nAn undescribed boys' game. In it the following rhyme is used--\r\n\r\n    Hurly-burly, trumpy trace,\r\n    The cow stands in the market-place;\r\n    Some goes far, and some goes near,\r\n    Where shall this poor sinner steer?\r\n\r\n--Patterson's _Antrim and Down Glossary_.\r\n\r\nFor a similar rhyme see \"Hot Cockles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHuss\r\n\r\nChildren play a game which is accompanied by a song beginning--\r\n\r\n    Hussing and bussing will not do,\r\n    But go to the gate, knock, and ring--\r\n    Please, Mrs. Brown, is Nellie within?\r\n\r\n--Parish's _Dictionary of the Sussex Dialect_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHustle Cap\r\n\r\nA boys' game, played by tossing up halfpence.

A hole of some extent was made\r\nin an uneven piece of ground, and the game was to shoot the marbles\r\nat some object beyond the hole without letting them tumble into it.\r\nThe game occasionally commenced by a ceremony of no very delicate\r\ndescription, which sufficed to render the fallen marble still more\r\nignominious.--Halliwell's _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsabella\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Ogbourne, Wilts (H.

Last night when we parted\r\n           She was nigh broken-hearted,\r\n           To-morrow we gather\r\n           And a bright welcome be.\r\n           Then give me your hand, love,\r\n           Your hand, love, your hand, love,\r\n           Then give me your hand, love,\r\n               Isabella for me.\r\n               Isabella, Isabella,\r\n               Isabella for me.\r\n\r\n--North Derbyshire (S. O. Addy).\r\n\r\n(_b_) In the Enborne, Newbury, version (Miss Kimber) a ring is formed by\r\nthe children (boys and girls) joining hands. Another child stands in the\r\ncentre. The ring of children walk round while singing the verses. The\r\nsinging is confined to the ring. When the centre child is told to\r\n\"choose,\" she selects a boy from the ring, who goes into the centre and\r\nthey stand together. At the next verse these two children walk out of\r\nthe ring arm-in-arm. When the next verse is sung they return, and again\r\nstand in the centre. At the next verse the boy pretends to put a ring on\r\nthe girl's finger. They walk out of the ring when told to go to church\r\n(two children in the ring unclasping hands to let them walk out, and\r\nagain clasping hands after they return), and kiss each other and shake\r\nhands when the two next verses are sung. The child who was first in the\r\ncentre then joins the ring, and the game proceeds in the same way with\r\nthe second child, who chooses in his turn. All the other versions follow\r\nthe same rules, suiting their actions to the words, except Ogbourne,\r\nWilts, in which the two children in the centre sing the verse, \"roast\r\nbeef and plum pudding.\" They stand face to face, take hold of each\r\nother's hands, and sway their arms from side to side. The ring then sing\r\nthe concluding verse. In those versions where \"say your prayers\" and\r\n\"kneel down\" occur, the two centre children kneel, and hold their open\r\nhands together in front of them to imitate a book. In the London version\r\n(A. B. Gomme) a handkerchief was laid on the ground, and the two\r\nchildren stood on each side of it and clasped hands across it. In the\r\nFernham and Longcot version the one child leads the other out of the\r\nring at \"go to church,\" with a graceful half-dancing motion, and back\r\nagain in the same way. The first child joins the ring while the refrain\r\nis sung. In the Hanbury version the centre child pretends to be weeping;\r\nanother child stands outside the ring and goes into it; when the two\r\nmeet they kiss. In the North Derbyshire version (Mr. S. O. Addy) a ring\r\nis formed of young men and women, a young man being in the centre. He\r\nchooses a young woman at the singing of the fifth line, and then joins\r\nthe ring, the girl remaining in the centre.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The tunes of all versions are very similar. The tune of the\r\nNewbury game (Miss Kimber) is the same as the _first_ part of the\r\nOgbourne tune printed (Mr. H. S. May); that from Nottingham (Miss\r\nYoungman) is the same as the first part of the London version. This is\r\nalso the case with the Hanbury, Staffs. (Miss E. Hollis) and Fernham and\r\nLongcot game. What difference there is is very slight. The Platt, Kent,\r\ngame (Miss Burne), is sung to the same tune as \"Green Gravel,\" given\r\n_ante_, p. 170. The _first_ portion only of the tune is repeated for all\r\nverses sung after the first verse. The Barnes game is sung to the same\r\ntune as the Earls Heaton (Mr. Hardy), which is printed _ante_. A version\r\nplayed at Barnes is almost identical with the Southampton version, and\r\nanother collected by Miss Thoyts in Berkshire (_Antiquary_, vol. xxvii.\r\np. 193) is similar to the Hanbury version. The first lines run--Choose\r\nyour lover; Open the gates; Go to church, love; Kneel down, love; Say\r\nyour prayers, love; Put on the ring; Stand up, love; In the ring, love;\r\nKiss together, love.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The words of all the versions are sufficiently similar to analyse\r\nwithout a special form. The game appears to be purely a love and\r\nmarriage game, and has probably had its origin in a ballad, and this\r\nidea is strengthened by the fact that only one version (London) has the\r\nmarriage formula sung at the end, and this is probably an arbitrary\r\naddition. The lover is represented as lonely and disconsolate, and the\r\nremedy suggested is to choose a sweetheart. The marriage ceremony is of\r\nthe simplest description--the clasping of hands and the kissing within\r\nthe circle probably implying the betrothal at a spot sacred to such\r\nfunctions, similar to the Standing Stones of Stenness. Whatever may have\r\nbeen the original intention of these stones, they came in more recent\r\ntimes to be the resort of lovers, who joined their right hands through\r\nthe hole in the altar stones in the belief that this ceremony would add\r\nadditional solemnity to the betrothal. Miss Gordon Cumming, in her _Tour\r\nin the Hebrides_, mentions the fact of the marriage ceremony being of\r\nthe simplest--a man and woman standing facing each other and clasping\r\nhands over a particular stone. Walking arm-in-arm is a sign in\r\nDorsetshire that a couple are married. The mention of the \"roast beef\r\nand plum pudding\" for dinner has probably had its origin in the wedding\r\ndinner or breakfast, and the inviting of friends to assemble for the\r\nwedding dinner. The word \"Isabella\" may have been originally something\r\nquite different from the name of a girl. I am inclined to think the word\r\nwas not the name of a person at all; possibly it was something addressed\r\nto a particular person in words the sense of which are now lost, and the\r\nnearest idea to it was this name. The same thing may also apply to the\r\nword \"farewell,\" and hence the incongruity of the first few lines in\r\nnearly all versions.\r\n\r\n\r\nJack's Alive.\r\n\r\nA number of people sit in a row, or on chairs round a parlour. A\r\nlighted wooden spill or taper is handed to the first, who says--\r\n\r\n    Jack's alive, and likely to live;\r\n    If he dies in your hand you've a forfeit to give.\r\n\r\nThe one in whose hand the light expires has to pay a forfeit. As the\r\nspill is getting burnt out the lines are said very quickly, as everybody\r\nis anxious not to have to pay the forfeit.--Addy's _Sheffield Glossary_.\r\n\r\nAt Egan, in Derbyshire, a number of persons sit round a fire; one of\r\nthem lights a stick, twirls it round, and says--\r\n\r\n    Little Nanny Cockerthaw,\r\n    What if I should let her fa'?\r\n\r\nThe others reply--\r\n\r\n    Nine sticks and nine stones\r\n    Shall be laid on thy bare back bones\r\n    If thou shouldst let fa'\r\n    Little Nanny Cockerthaw.\r\n\r\nIf the ember or lighted stick goes out whilst any one is twirling it\r\nround, and whilst the lines are being said, he has to lie on the floor,\r\nwhen stones, chairs, or other articles of furniture are piled upon\r\nhim.--S. O. Addy.\r\n\r\nMactaggart calls it \"Preest Cat,\" and says that it is an ingleside game.\r\nA piece of stick is made red in the fire; one hands it to another,\r\nsaying--\r\n\r\n    About wi' that, about wi' that,\r\n    Keep alive the preest cat.\r\n\r\nThen round is handed the stick, and whomsoever's hand it goes out in,\r\nthat one is in a wad, and must kiss the crook, the cleps, and what not,\r\nere he gets out of it.\r\n\r\n    Lilly cuckoo, lilly cuckoo,\r\n    Sticks and stanes lie at thy weary banes\r\n    If thou fa', for a' I blaw,\r\n    Lilly cuckoo, lilly cuckoo.\r\n\r\nThis rhyme is common in the \"Preest Cat\" sport toward the border.\r\nAnciently, when the priest's cat departed this life, wailing began in\r\nthe country side, as it was thought it became some supernatural being--a\r\nwitch, perhaps, of hideous form--so to keep it alive was a great\r\nmatter.--Mactaggart's _Gallovidian Encyclopædia_.\r\n\r\nHe also refers to a game called \"Robin-a-Ree,\" much like \"Preest Cat,\"\r\nonly in passing the burnt stick round the ring the following rhyme is\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n    Robin-a-Ree, ye'll no dee wi' me,\r\n    Tho' I birl ye roun' three times and three;\r\n    O Robin-a-Ree, O Robin-a-Ree,\r\n    O dinna let Robin-a-Reerie dee.\r\n\r\nRobin-a-Ree occurs in an old song.--Mactaggart's _Gallovidian\r\nEncyclopædia_.\r\n\r\nIn Cornwall it is known as \"Robin's a-light,\" and is played around the\r\nfire. A piece of stick is set on fire and whirled around rapidly in the\r\nhand of the first player, who says, \"Robin's a-light, and if he go out I\r\nwill saddle your back.\" It is then passed to the next, who says the same\r\nthing, and so on. The person who lets the spark die out has to pay a\r\nforfeit.--Scilly (Courtney's West _Cornwall Glossary_). A rhyme at\r\nLostwithiel is known as follows--\r\n\r\n    Jack's alive, and likely to live;\r\n    If he die in my hand a pawn (forfeit) I'll give.\r\n\r\n--(J. W.)\r\n\r\nJamieson (_Dictionary_) says, \"To do 'Dingle-dousie,' a stick is ignited\r\nat one end and given as a plaything to a child.\" Elworthy (_West\r\nSomerset Words_) does not give this as a game, but says a burning stick\r\nwas whirled round and round very quickly, so as to keep up the\r\nappearance of a ribbon of fire. Miss Burne (_Shropshire Folk-lore_, p.\r\n530), says, \"Children wave a burning stick in the air, saying--\r\n\r\n    A girdle o' gold, a saddle o' silk,\r\n    A horse for me as white as milk,\r\n\r\nan evident relic of divinations or incantations practised with\r\nbonfires.\" Halliwell (_Nursery Rhymes_, p. 213) gives the rhyme as--\r\n\r\n    Jack's alive, and in very good health,\r\n    If he dies in your hand you must look to yourself;\r\n\r\nthe game being played in the same way as the Sheffield version (see also\r\nHalliwell's _Dictionary_ and Moor's _Suffolk Words_).\r\n\r\n(_b_) This is a very significant game, and its similarity in miniature\r\nto the old tribal custom of carrying the fiery cross to rouse the clans\r\nat once suggests the possible origin of it. The detention of the fiery\r\ncross through neglect or other impediment was regarded with much dread\r\nby the inhabitants of the place in which it should occur. This subject\r\nis discussed in _Gomme's Primitive Folkmoots_, p. 279 _et seq._\r\n\r\n\r\nJack, Jack, the Bread's a-burning\r\n\r\n    Jack, Jack, the bread's a-burning,\r\n    All to a cinder;\r\n    If you don't come and fetch it out\r\n    We'll throw it through the winder.\r\n\r\nThese lines are chanted by players that stand thus. One places his back\r\nagainst a wall, tree, &c., grasping another, whose back is toward him,\r\nround the waist; the second grasps a third, and so on. The player called\r\nJack walks apart until the conclusion of the lines. Then he goes to the\r\nothers and pokes at or pats them, saying, \"I don't think you're done\r\nyet,\" and walks away again. The chant is repeated, and when he is\r\nsatisfied that the bread is \"done\" he endeavours to pull the foremost\r\nfrom the grasp of the others, &c.--Warwickshire (Northall's _Folk\r\nRhymes_, p. 390).\r\n\r\nSee \"Mother Mop.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJack upon the Mopstick\r\n\r\nSee \"Bung the Bucket.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJackysteauns\r\n\r\nA game among school-girls, played with small pebbles, and sometimes with\r\nplum or cherry stones (Dickinson's _Cumberland Glossary_). \"A children's\r\ngame, played with five white pebbles called Jackstones,\" says Mr.\r\nPatterson (_Antrim and Down Glossary_).

Stephen).\r\n\r\n(_b_) Two children stand apart; one, who personates the Mother, stands\r\nstill and holds out her skirts with both hands; the other personates\r\nJenny Jones, and kneels or stoops down in a crouching position behind\r\nher companion's outstretched skirts. The other players form a line by\r\njoining hands. They sing the first, third, and every alternate verse,\r\nadvancing and retiring in line while doing so. The Mother sings the\r\nanswers to their questions, standing still and hiding Jenny Jones all\r\nthe time from view. When the verses are finished, Jenny Jones lies down\r\nas if she were dead, and the Mother stands aside. Two of the other\r\nplayers then take up Jenny Jones, one by the shoulders and the other by\r\nthe feet, and carry her a little distance off, where they lay her on the\r\nground. All the players follow, generally two by two, with their\r\nhandkerchiefs at their eyes and heads lowered, pretending to grieve.\r\n\r\nThis is the more general way of playing the game. In those versions\r\nwhere the reply, \"Very well, ladies,\" occurs, this is sung by the line\r\nof children just before they sing, \"We've come to see Jenny Jones.\"\r\nSometimes, as in the Berrington and Chirbury game, two lines of children\r\nfacing each other advance and retire, singing the verses. They then\r\ncarry Jenny Jones to a corner, lay her down, stand in a circle round,\r\nand sing to her the last verse. In the Hants versions sent by Miss\r\nMendham, six or eight children carry Jenny stretched out and flat, lay\r\nher down, cover her over, and then sing the last lines. The rest of the\r\nchildren follow them. In the Irish (Belfast) version the game is played\r\nin the same way; the funeral is arranged, when Jenny suddenly comes to\r\nlife again (W. H. Patterson). In the Southampton version, after the\r\ncarrying of Jenny by her head and feet to the grave, and the other\r\nchildren following and standing round, Jenny Jones rises up and pursues\r\nthe children. She is called the Ghost. The children run away in affected\r\nterror, calling out, \"The Ghost!\" Whoever she catches becomes Jenny\r\nJones in the next game. This incident is also played in the Barnes,\r\nNorthants, Annaverna, co. Louth, Enborne and Liphook versions.\r\n\r\n(_c_) This game is played very generally throughout the country, and I\r\nhave other versions collected from Earls Heaton (Mr. H. Hardy), Barnes\r\n(A. B. Gomme), Cambridge (Mrs. Haddon), Hampshire (Miss Mendham),\r\nFrodingham (Miss Peacock), Cowes, Isle of Wight (Miss E. Smith),\r\nSulhampstead, Berks (Miss Thoyts), and Platt, Kent (Miss Burne). These\r\nversions are so similar to the Hanwell version, with the exception of\r\nthe \"Very well, ladies,\" that it is needless to print them in full;\r\nspecial differences are noted hereafter. In some places the game is said\r\nin a sing-song manner.\r\n\r\nSome of the versions differ from the general type in two ways--first, in\r\nthe method of playing; secondly, in the wording of the verses. The\r\ndifferences in the method of playing direct attention to the connection\r\nof the game with ancient custom. The game is always played by the\r\nplayers taking sides; but one method is for one side to consist of only\r\ntwo children (Mother and Jenny Jones), and the other side to consist of\r\nall the other players; while the other method is for the players to be\r\ndivided into two sides of about equal numbers, each side advancing and\r\nretiring in line when singing their part. Jenny Jones in some cases\r\nwalks with the girls in her line until the funeral, when she is carried\r\nto the grave, and in others she stands alone behind the line. The way of\r\nperforming the funeral also differs. Generally two of the players carry\r\nJenny to the grave, the rest following two by two; but in one Hampshire\r\nversion six or eight children carry Jenny, stretched out and flat, to\r\nthe grave, and cover her over; in Holywood, co. Down, she is carried\r\nsitting on the crossed hands of two players; while in some versions no\r\nfuneral is apparently performed, the words only being sung. Another\r\nsignificant incident is the Ghost. An additional incident occurs in the\r\nLiphook version, which represents her being \"swung to life again\" by two\r\nof the players.\r\n\r\nThese differences may perhaps be immaterial to the meaning and origin of\r\nthe game, but they are sufficiently indicative of early custom to\r\nsuggest the divergence of the game in modern times towards modern\r\ncustom. Thus the players divided line-by-line follow the general form\r\nfor children playing singing games, and it would therefore suggest\r\nitself as the earlier form for this game. The change of the game from\r\nthe line-by-line action to the mother-and-line action would indicate a\r\ncorresponding change in the prevailing custom which influenced the game.\r\nThis custom was the wooing by a band of suitors of girls surrounded by\r\ntheir fellow-villagers, which became obsolete in favour of ordinary\r\nmarriage custom. The dropping out of this custom would cause the game to\r\nchange from a representation of both wooing and burial to one of burial\r\nonly. As burial only the mother-and-line action is sufficient, but the\r\npresence of a wooing incident in the earlier form of the game is plainly\r\nrevealed by the verse which sings, \"Fare ye well, ladies,\" or, as it has\r\nbecome in the English variant, \"Very well, ladies.\"\r\n\r\nThe difference in the wording of the versions is slight, and does not\r\nneed formal analysis. Domestic occupation is shown throughout, washing\r\nand its attendants, drying, folding, starching and ironing being by far\r\nthe most numerous, brewing, and baking only occurring in one. Illness,\r\ndying, and death are the usual forms for the later verses, but illness\r\nand dying are lost in several versions. The choosing of colours is in\r\nsome versions not for the mourners but for the dead maiden, and in these\r\ncases (six) white is the colour chosen, for \"white's what the dead\r\nwear.\"\r\n\r\nThis question of colours for the dead is a very important one. The\r\ndressing of the dead body of a maiden in white by her girl companions,\r\nand the carrying of the body by them to the grave, are known village\r\ncustoms, the whole village being invited to the funeral. The rising of\r\nthe dead lover, and the belief that excessive mourning over a loved one\r\ndisturbs his or her rest in the grave, thus causing the dead to rise and\r\nspeak, are shown in old ballads; the belief that spirits of the dead\r\nhaunt churchyards and places of their former abode may also be adduced\r\nin illustration of the ghost incident.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The methods of playing, and the incidents revealed by the verses\r\nsung, show that this is perhaps the most realistic of all the singing\r\ngames, the daily occupation, the illness, death, and burial being\r\nportrayed, first, in the words of the rhymes, and secondly, by the\r\naccompanying action. The Scottish versions make the opening incident\r\nthat of a lover coming to the house of the loved one, then proceed to\r\nthe domestic occupation, and finally to the death incident; while the\r\nEnglish versions give the idea of village friends calling upon a\r\nfavourite companion, and subsequently attending her funeral. That the\r\nformer is the older of the two versions is confirmed by the great\r\nprobability of the name \"Jenny Jones\" being a degraded form of \"Janet\r\njo.\" There is some evidence for this. The Sporle version gives it as\r\n\"Jenny Joe,\" which is clearly a misunderstood rendering of \"Jenny jo.\"\r\nThe corruption of this into \"Jenny Jones\" is exactly what might be\r\nexpected from modern English ignorance of the pretty meaning of the word\r\njo, \"dear;\" and to what lengths this corruption may proceed under such\r\ninfluences may be seen by versions from Earls Heaton, where we have\r\n\"Jingy Jog;\" Leeds, where we get \"Jilly Jog;\" and the Edinburgh version,\r\nwhere we have \"Georgina.\"\r\n\r\nThis would be an argument for the Scottish home of the rhymes, and for\r\nthe direct borrowing of the name from Scotland by the English villagers.\r\nIn furtherance of this view the following passage from Chambers may be\r\nquoted:--\r\n\r\nIn the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, \"Janet Jo\" is a dramatic\r\nentertainment amongst young rustics. Suppose a party has met in a\r\nharvest or winter evening round a good peat fire, and it is resolved to\r\nhave \"Janet Jo\" performed. Two undertake to personate a goodman and a\r\ngoodwife; the rest a family of marriageable daughters. One of the lads,\r\nthe best singer of the party, retires, and equips himself in a dress\r\nproper for representing an old bachelor in search of a wife. He comes\r\nin, bonnet in hand, bowing, and sings--\r\n\r\n                    Guid e'en to ye, maidens a',\r\n                    Maidens a', maidens a',\r\n                    Guid e'en to ye, maidens a',\r\n                        Be ye or no.\r\n\r\n                    I'm come to court Janet jo,\r\n                    Janet jo, Janet jo,\r\n                    I'm come to court Janet jo,\r\n                        Janet, my jo.\r\n\r\n     Goodwife sings--What'll ye gie for Janet jo,\r\n                    Janet jo, Janet jo?\r\n                    What'll ye gie for Janet jo,\r\n                        Janet, my jo?\r\n\r\n              Wooer--I'll gie ye a peck o' siller,\r\n                    A peck o' siller, peck o' siller,\r\n                    I'll gie ye a peck o' siller,\r\n                        For Janet, my jo.\r\n\r\n      Goodwife says--Gae awa', ye auld carle!\r\n\r\n         Then sings--Ye'se never get Janet jo,\r\n                    Janet jo, Janet jo,\r\n                    Ye'se never get Janet jo,\r\n                        Janet, my jo.\r\n\r\nThe wooer hereupon retires, singing a verse expressive of mortification,\r\nbut soon re-enters with a reassured air, singing--\r\n\r\n    I'll gie ye a peck o' gowd,\r\n    A peck o' gowd, a peck o' gowd,\r\n    I'll gie ye a peck o' gowd,\r\n        For Janet, my jo.\r\n\r\nThe matron gives him a rebuff as before, and he again retires\r\ndiscomfited, and again enters, singing an offer of \"twa pecks o' gowd,\"\r\nwhich, however, is also refused. At his next entry he offers \"three\r\npecks o' gowd,\" at which the good wife brightens up and sings--\r\n\r\n    Come ben beside Janet jo,\r\n    Janet jo, Janet jo,\r\n    Ye're welcome to Janet jo,\r\n        Janet, my jo.\r\n\r\nThe suitor then advances gaily to his sweetheart, and the affair ends in\r\na scramble for kisses.--_Popular Rhymes_, pp. 141, 142.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it must not be overlooked that this game-drama and\r\nthe game of \"Janet Jo\" have no connection beyond the name of the heroine\r\nand the wooing incident; so that the borrowing, if borrowing there be,\r\nmight have been by Scotland, who improved the commonplace \"Jenny Jones\"\r\ninto the pretty sweetness of her Scottish namesake. The Scottish version\r\nof the game leaves out the question of the colours for mourning, but, on\r\nthe other hand, it contains the very important incident of the\r\nrestoration of the dead. Chambers (_Popular Rhymes_, p. 141) suggests\r\nthat this incident was introduced for the purpose of beginning the game\r\nagain, but this seems extremely doubtful, in consideration of the\r\nLiphook variant, in which Miss Fowler says, \"It is no uncommon thing for\r\n'Jenny Jones' to be swung into life again;\" and the still more\r\nsignificant Southampton version, where \"'Jenny Jones' appears in the\r\ncharacter of the Ghost, and scatters and pursues the surrounding\r\nmourners.\" This detail is also used by the Northants and Barnes\r\nchildren, the version of whose game is very like the Southampton one. On\r\nthe whole, the analysis would suggest that there has been a game played\r\nby the children of both England and Scotland, the leading incidents of\r\nwhich have been varied in accordance with the conditions of life. Mr.\r\nNapier (_Folk-lore Record_, iv. 474), in his description of the West\r\nScotland example, evidently considered the game to be thoroughly\r\nrepresentative of Scottish life, and this, indeed, seems to be the most\r\nstriking feature of the game in all the variants. The domestic economy\r\nwhich they reveal is in no case out of keeping with the known facts of\r\neveryday peasant life, and many a mother has denied to her child's\r\nfriends the companionship they desired because of the work to be done.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the burden of the song rests upon the question of health,\r\nbut in two cases, namely, Colchester and Deptford, the question is put\r\nas to where \"Jenny Jones\" is at the time of the visit. It is curious\r\nthat the refrain of \"Farewell, ladies,\" should appear in such widely\r\nseparated districts as Scotland, Northamptonshire, Norfolk, Middlesex,\r\nHants, Lincoln, and Barnes.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the colours for mourning, there is an obvious addition\r\nof crape introduced into the Deptford version which is very suggestive\r\nof the decadence going on. The four colours used in most versions are\r\nred, blue, white, and black, colours which have been known to the people\r\nfrom ancient times. Black is accepted as the correct colour in all\r\nversions except five, where white is declared to be the colour which the\r\ndead wear. The method of question and answer is adopted for all the\r\nrhyme-movements. The tune of the game, with but slight variation, in all\r\nthe versions is the same as that given from Platt, near Wrotham, except\r\nthe two which are printed from Northants and Belfast.\r\n\r\n\r\nJenny Mac\r\n\r\n    Jenny Mac, Jenny Mac, Jenny Macghie,\r\n    Turn your back about to me;\r\n    And if you find an ill baubee,\r\n    Lift it up and gie't to me.\r\n\r\nTwo girls cross their arms behind their backs, and thus taking hold of\r\neach other's hands, parade along together, by daylight or moonlight,\r\noccasionally turning upon their arms, as indicated in the rhyme.\r\nAnother rhyme for this amusement is--\r\n\r\n    A basket, a basket, a bonny penny basket,\r\n    A penny to you, and a penny to me,\r\n        Turn about the basket.\r\n\r\n--Chambers's _Popular Rhymes_; p. 123.\r\n\r\nSee \"Basket.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJib-Job-Jeremiah\r\n\r\nAn undescribed Suffolk game.--Moor's _Suffolk Words_, p. 238.\r\n\r\n\r\nJiddy-cum-jiddy\r\n\r\nA northern name for \"See Saw.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJingle-the-bonnet\r\n\r\nA game in which two or more put a halfpenny each, or any piece of coin,\r\ninto a cap or bonnet.

They form\r\ninto couples, each standing behind the other, making a ring, the girls\r\ninside, one boy standing alone in the middle. As they go round they sing\r\nthe verse. At the end each boy leaves hold of his partner's arm and\r\ncatches the arm of the girl in front, the one who is standing in the\r\ncentre trying in the confusion to get into a place. If he succeeds, the\r\nchild left out has to be the one in the centre the next time.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Mr. Newell (_Games_, p. 101) says this game was called the\r\n\"Baptist Game\" in Virginia, where it is said to be enjoyed by pious\r\npeople who will not dance. The American game is played in the same way\r\nas the English one. Mr. Newell gives the tune to which the game was\r\nsung. The words are almost identical. This game is played in the same\r\nway as \"Jolly Miller,\" which see.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohnny Rover\r\n\r\nOne boy is chosen to be Johnny Rover. The other players stand near him.\r\nRover cries out--\r\n\r\n    A [I] warn ye ance, A warn you twice;\r\n      A warn ye three times over;\r\n    A warn ye a' t' be witty an' wise\r\n      An flee fae Johnny Rover.\r\n\r\nWhile the words are being repeated all the players are putting\r\nthemselves on the alert, and when they are finished they run off in all\r\ndirections, with Rover in full pursuit. If a player is hard pressed he\r\nhas the privilege of running to \"Parley,\" the place from which the\r\nplayers started, and which in all games is an asylum. If he is caught\r\nbefore he reaches it, he becomes Johnny Rover for the next game. The one\r\nfirst captured becomes Rover.--Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\n\r\nJolly Fishermen\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Tean, North Staffs. (Miss Burne).\r\n\r\n    I.

Potteries (Mrs. Thomas Lawton).\r\n\r\n(_b_) A circle is formed by joining hands, and two children stand in the\r\ncentre. They walk round. At the seventh line the two in the centre each\r\nchoose one child from the ring, thus making four in the centre. They\r\nthen sing the remaining four lines. The two who were first in the centre\r\nthen go out, and the game begins again, with the other two players in\r\nthe centre.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Miss Burne says this game is more often played as \"Three Jolly\r\nFishermen.\" At Cheadle, North Staffs., a few miles distant from Tean,\r\nthis game is played by grown-up men and women.\r\n\r\n\r\nJolly Hooper\r\n\r\n    I.

O. Addy).\r\n\r\n(_b_) A number of children stand against a wall, and a row of other\r\nchildren face them. They walk backwards and forwards, singing the first\r\nand third verses. Then the children who are standing still (against the\r\nwall) answer by singing the second and fourth verses. When these are\r\nsung the moving line of children take Mary and dance round, singing\r\n\"some lines which my informant,\" says Mr. Addy, \"has forgotten.\"\r\n\r\n(_c_) I have no description of the way Miss Chase's game is played. It,\r\ntoo, is probably an incomplete version. The words \"Ring ding di do do\r\n\"show a possible connection between this and games of the \"Three Dukes\r\na-riding\" type.

Potteries (Miss A. A. Keary).\r\n\r\n(_b_) This game requires an uneven number of players. All the children\r\nexcept one stand in couples arm in arm, each couple closely following\r\nthe other. This forms a double ring or wheel (fig. 1). The odd child\r\nstands in the centre. The children forming the wheel walk round in a\r\ncircle and sing the verse. When they come to the word \"grab,\" those\r\nchildren standing on the _inside_ of the wheel leave hold of their\r\npartners' arms, and try to catch hold of the one standing immediately in\r\nfront of their previous partners. The child in the centre (or Miller)\r\ntries (while they are changing places) to secure a partner and place\r\n(fig. 2). If he succeeds in doing this, the one then left out becomes\r\nthe Miller. At Leicester the \"odd\" child, or \"miller,\" stands _outside_\r\nthe wheel or ring, instead of being in the centre, and it is the outside\r\nchildren who change places. Mr. Addy, in the Sheffield version, says,\r\n\"The young men stand in the outer ring, and the young women in the\r\ninner. A man stands within the inner circle, quite near to it. The men\r\ntry and grasp the arm of the girl in front of them, and the man in the\r\ncentre also tries to grasp one; the man he displaces taking his place as\r\nMiller. Then the three last lines are sung.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n(_c_) Versions of this game, almost identical with the Leicester version\r\ngiven here (with the exception that the word \"wealth\" ends the second\r\nline instead of \"pelf\"), have been sent me from East Kirkby,\r\nLincolnshire (Miss K. Maughan); Epworth, Doncaster (Mr. C. C. Bell);\r\nSettle, Yorks. (Rev. W. S. Sykes); Derbyshire (Mrs. Harley); Redhill,\r\nSurrey (Miss G.

Miss Peacock sends a version\r\nwhich obtains at Lincoln, Horncastle, Winterton, and Anderby,\r\nLincolnshire, and in Nottinghamshire; it is identical with the Liphook\r\nversion. Two versions from Sporle, Norfolk, which vary slightly from the\r\nLeicester, have been sent by Miss Matthews. The versions given from\r\nLancashire, Yorks., Nottingham, and North Staffs. have been selected to\r\nshow the process of decadence in the game. \"Hopper\" has first become\r\n\"upper,\" and then \"other.\" Of the North Staffs. Potteries version Miss\r\nKeary says, \"How it ends I have never been able to make out; no one\r\nabout here seems to know either.\" With the exception of these few\r\nvariants, it is singular how stereotyped the words of the rhyme have\r\nbecome in this game.\r\n\r\n(_d_) This game may owe its origin to the fact of the miller in olden\r\ntimes paying himself in kind from the corn brought to him to be ground.\r\nThe miller is a well-known object of satire in old ballads and mediaeval\r\nwriters. It is, however, probable that the custom which formerly\r\nprevailed at some of the public festivals, of catching or \"grabbing\" for\r\nsweethearts and wives, is shown in this game. For instance, to account\r\nfor a Scottish custom it is said that St. Cowie, patron saint of two\r\nparishes of Campbeltown, proposed that all who did not find themselves\r\nhappy and contented in the marriage state, should be indulged with an\r\nopportunity of parting and making a second choice. For that purpose he\r\ninstituted an annual solemnity, at which all the unhappy couples in his\r\nparish were to assemble at his church; and at midnight all present were\r\nblindfolded and ordered to run round the church at full speed, with a\r\nview of mixing the lots in the urn. The moment the ceremony was over,\r\nwithout allowing an instant for the people present to recover from their\r\nconfusion, the word \"Cabbay\" (seize quickly) was pronounced, upon which\r\nevery man laid hold of the first female he met with. Whether old or\r\nyoung, handsome or ugly, good or bad, she was his wife till the next\r\nanniversary of this custom (Guthrie's _Scottish Customs_, p. 168).\r\nAnother old wedding superstition is alluded to by Longfellow:--\r\n\r\n    \"While the bride with roguish eyes,\r\n    Sporting with them, now escapes and cries,\r\n    'Those who catch me, married verily this year will be.'\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Joggle Along.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJolly Rover\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Derbyshire (Mrs. Harley).\r\n\r\n    Here comes one jolly rover, jolly rover, jolly rover,\r\n    Here comes one jolly rover, jolly rover, jolly rover,\r\n    A roving all day.\r\n\r\n    And what do you rove for, rove for, rove for?\r\n    And what do you rove for?\r\n    Lily white and shining.\r\n\r\n    I rove for my pleasure, my pleasure, my pleasure,\r\n    I rove for my pleasure, my pleasure, my pleasure,\r\n    Lily white and shining.\r\n\r\n    And what is your pleasure, your pleasure, your pleasure?\r\n    What is your pleasure?\r\n    Lily white and shining.\r\n\r\n    My pleasure's for to marry you, to marry you, to marry you,\r\n    My pleasure's for to marry you,\r\n    Lily white and shining.\r\n\r\n    So through the kitchen and through the hall,\r\n    I choose the fairest of them all,\r\n    The fairest one that I can see\r\n    Is ----, so come to me.\r\n\r\n--Derbyshire (Mrs. Harley).\r\n\r\n(_b_) A long row of children walk to and fro. One child, facing them on\r\nthe opposite side, represents the Rover. He sings the first, third, and\r\nfifth verses. The row of children sing the second and fourth in\r\nresponse. After the fifth verse is sung the Rover skips round the long\r\nrow, singing the sixth verse to the tune of \"Nancy Dawson,\" or \"Round\r\nthe Mulberry bush.\" He chooses one of them, who goes to the opposite\r\nside with him, and the game goes on until all are rovers like himself.\r\n\r\nSee \"Here comes a Lusty Wooer,\" \"Jolly Hooper.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJolly Sailors\r\n\r\n    I.

One child walks round\r\ninside the ring, singing the verses. This child then chooses another\r\nfrom the ring, bending on one knee and kissing her hand. The lines are\r\nthen repeated, the two walking arm in arm round the inside of the ring.\r\nAnother child is chosen out of the ring by the one who was chosen\r\npreviously. This goes on until all are chosen out of the ring, walking\r\ntwo by two round inside. When the ring will no longer hold them, the two\r\nwalk round outside. At Northants the ring walks round, and the child is\r\n_outside_ the ring. Partners are chosen, and the two walk round outside\r\nthe ring. The first two walk together till there is a third, then the\r\nthree walk together till there is a fourth, then they go in couples. In\r\nthe Northants version, from Raunds, four boys stand in the centre of the\r\nring. When the verses are sung they choose four girls, and then take\r\ntheir places in the ring. The four girls then choose four lads, and so\r\non. At Earls Heaton the children stand against a wall in a line. Another\r\nchild walks up and down singing the verses, and chooses a partner. He\r\nspreads a handkerchief on the ground, and they kneel and kiss.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The Shipley version is a \"Kiss in the Ring\" game. A version sent\r\nby the Rev. W. Slater Sykes from Settle, Yorkshire, is almost identical\r\nwith the Earls Heaton version. Northall (_Folk Rhymes_, p. 369) says \"to\r\nkiss on the floor\"--_i.e._, not in secret. He gives the words of a sort\r\nof musical catch, sung in the Midlands, similar in character to this\r\ngame, which may once have been used in some courting game. Mr. Newell\r\n(_Games_, p. 124) gives a version sung in the streets of New York, and\r\nconsiders it to be a relic of antiquity, a similar round being given in\r\n_Deuteromelia_, 1609.\r\n\r\n\r\nJowls\r\n\r\nA game played by boys, much the same as \"Hockey,\" and taking its name,\r\nno doubt, from the mode of playing, which consists in striking a wooden\r\nball or knorr from the ground in any given direction with a sufficiently\r\nheavy stick, duly curved at the striking end.--Atkinson's _Cleveland\r\nGlossary_.\r\n\r\nIt is also given in _Yorkshire Glossary_ (Whitby).\r\n\r\nSee \"Bandy,\" \"Doddart,\" \"Hockey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJud\r\n\r\nA game played with a hazel nut bored and run upon a string.--Dickinson's\r\n_Cumberland Glossary_.\r\n\r\nProbably the same game as \"Conkers.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Conkers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKeeling the Pot\r\n\r\nBrockett mentions that a friend informed him that he had seen a game\r\nplayed amongst children in Northumberland the subject of which was\r\n\"Keeling the Pot.\" A girl comes in exclaiming, \"Mother, mother, the\r\npot's boiling ower.\" The answer is, \"Then get the ladle and keel it.\"\r\nThe difficulty is to get the ladle, which is \"up a height,\" and the\r\n\"steul\" wants a leg, and the joiner is either sick or dead (_Glossary\r\nNorth Country Words_). A sentence from _Love's Labours Lost_, \"While\r\ngreasy Joan doth keel the pot,\" illustrates the use of the term \"keel.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Mother, Mother, the Pot Boils over.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKeppy Ball\r\n\r\nIn former times it was customary every year, at Easter and Whitsuntide,\r\nfor the mayor, aldermen, and sheriff of Newcastle, attended by the\r\nburgesses, to go in state to a place called the Forth, a sort of mall,\r\nto countenance, if not to join in the play of \"Keppy ba\" and other\r\nsports. This diversion is still in part kept up by the young people of\r\nthe town (Brockett's _North Country Words_). It is also mentioned in\r\nPeacock's _Manley and Corringham Glossary_, and in Ross and Stead's\r\n_Holderness Glossary_.\r\n\r\nMr. Tate (_History of Alnwick_) says that a favourite pastime of girls,\r\n\"Keppy ball,\" deserves a passing notice, because accompanied by a\r\npeculiar local song. The name indicates the character of the game; \"kep\"\r\nis from _cepan_, Anglo-Saxon, \"kappan,\" Teut., \"to catch or capture;\"\r\nfor when the game was played at by several, the ball was thrown into the\r\nair and \"kepped,\" or intercepted, in its descent by one or other of the\r\ngirls, and it was then thrown up again to be caught by some other. But\r\nwhen the song was sung it was played out by one girl, who sent the ball\r\nagainst a tree and drove it back again as often as she could, saying the\r\nfollowing rhymes, in order to divine her matrimonial future:--\r\n\r\n    Keppy ball, keppy ball, Coban tree,\r\n    Come down the long loanin' and tell to me,\r\n    The form and the features, the speech and degree\r\n    Of the man that is my true love to be.\r\n\r\n    Keppy ball, keppy ball, Coban tree,\r\n    Come down the long loanin' and tell to me\r\n    How many years old I am to be.\r\n\r\n          One a maiden, two a wife,\r\n          Three a maiden, four a wife, &c.\r\n\r\nThe numbers being continued as long as the ball could be kept rebounding\r\nagainst the tree.\r\n\r\nThe following from Halliwell's _Nursery Rhymes_, p. 298, is also used\r\nfor ball divination. To \"cook\" is to toss or throw.\r\n\r\n    Cook a ball, cherry tree;\r\n    Good ball, tell me\r\n    How many years I shall be\r\n    Before my true love I do see?\r\n    One and two, and that makes three;\r\n    Thankee, good ball, for telling of me.\r\n\r\nSee \"Ball,\" \"Cuckoo,\" \"Monday.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKibel and Nerspel\r\n\r\nThis game was played at Stixwold seventy years ago. It resembled \"Trap,\r\nBat, and Ball.\" _Kibel_ = bat, _ner_ = ball of maplewood, _spel_ = trap,\r\nwith a limock (pliant) stick fastened to it. The score was made by\r\nhitting the _ner_ a certain distance, but not by the striker running, as\r\nin \"Rounders.\"--Miss M. Peacock.\r\n\r\nSee \"Nur and Spell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKing by your leave\r\n\r\n\"A playe that children have, where one sytting blyndefolde in the midle,\r\nbydeth so tyll the rest have hydden themselves, and then he going to\r\nseeke them, if any get his place in the meane space, that same is kynge\r\nin his roome.\"--Huloet, 1572.\r\n\r\nSee \"Hide and Seek.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Cæsar\r\n\r\nOne player is chosen to be King Cæsar by lot or naming. All the others\r\nstand in two rows, one row at each end of the ground. A line is drawn on\r\nthe ground in front of them to mark \"dens.\" All the players must keep\r\nwithin this line. King Cæsar stands in the middle of the ground. Any\r\nnumber of the players can then rush across the ground from one den to\r\nanother. King Cæsar tries to catch one as they run. When he catches a\r\nboy he must count from one to ten in succession before he leaves hold of\r\nthe boy, that boy in the meantime trying to get away. If King Cæsar\r\nsucceeds in holding a boy, this boy stays in the centre with him and\r\nassists in catching the other players (always counting ten before a\r\ncaptive is secured). The dens must always be occupied by some players.\r\nIf all the players get into one den, King Cæsar can go into the empty\r\nden and say, \"Crown the base, one, two, three,\" three times before any\r\nof the other players get across to that den. If he succeeds in doing\r\nthis, he can select a boy to run across from one den to the other, which\r\nthat boy must do, King Cæsar trying to catch him. Other and bigger boys\r\ncan help this one to get across, to save him from being captured, either\r\nby carrying him or running across with him. The game ends when all have\r\nbeen captured and are in the centre. King Cæsar and the other captured\r\nboys can leave the centre if they each successively catch three\r\nplayers.--Barnes (A. B. Gomme).\r\n\r\nThis game is called \"King-sealing\" in Dorsetshire.\r\n\r\nSee \"King of Cantland,\" \"Lamploo.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Come-a-lay\r\n\r\nA game played by boys. Two sets of boys, or sides, strive which can\r\nsecure most prisoners for the King.--Shetland (Jamieson).\r\n\r\n\r\nKing of Cantland\r\n\r\nA game of children, in which one of a company, being chosen King o'\r\nCantland, and two goals appointed at a considerable distance from each\r\nother, all the rest endeavoured to run from one goal to the other; and\r\nthose whom the King can seize in their course, so as to lay his hand\r\nupon their heads (which operation is called winning them), become his\r\nsubjects, and assist him in catching the remainder.--Dumfries\r\n(Jamieson). Jamieson adds: \"This game is called 'King's Covenanter' in\r\nRoxburgh.\" He also refers to the game of \"King and Queen of Cantelon,\"\r\nrecorded by Mactaggart. He considers the origin of this game to be\r\nrepresentative of the contentions about the \"Debatable Lands\" on the\r\nborder. This game was played at University Coll. School, London, under\r\nthe name of \"Kings\" (A. Nutt).\r\n\r\nSee \"How many miles to Barley Bridge?\" \"King Cæsar.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKing o' the Castle\r\n\r\nOne boy is chosen as King. He mounts on any convenient height, a knoll,\r\nor dyke, or big stone, and shouts--\r\n\r\n    A'm King o' the Castle,\r\n    An' fah (who) 'll ding (knock) me doon?\r\n\r\nThe players make a rush at the King, and try to pull him down. A tussle\r\ngoes on for a longer or a shorter time, according to the strength of the\r\nKing and his skill in driving off his assailants. The boy that displaces\r\nthe King becomes King, and is in his turn assaulted in the same way. The\r\ngame may go on for any length of time. Another form of words is--\r\n\r\n    I'm the King o' the Castle,\r\n    An' nane can ding me doon.\r\n\r\n--Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\nOther words sung by the Scotch children are--\r\n\r\n    I, Willy Wastle,\r\n    Stand on my castle,\r\n    And a' the dogs o' your toon\r\n    Will no drive Willie Wastle doon.\r\n\r\nChambers (_Popular Rhymes_, p. 114) records the tradition that when\r\nOliver Cromwell lay at Haddington he sent to require the governor of\r\nHome Castle, in Berwickshire, to surrender; the governor is said to\r\nhave replied in the above quatrain of juvenile celebrity.\r\n\r\nThe London version is for the boys to run up a hillock, when one of them\r\ndeclares as follows--\r\n\r\n    I'm the King of the Castle;\r\n    Get down, you dirty rascal,\r\n\r\nwhereupon he pushes down his companions. If another boy succeeds in\r\ngetting his place he becomes King, and repeats the doggerel (G. L.\r\nGomme). This is a very popular boys' game. Newell (_Games_, 164)\r\nmentions it as prevalent in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nSee \"Tom Tiddler's Ground.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Plaster Palacey\r\n\r\nThe players are a King and his three sons named White Cap, Red Cap,\r\nBrown Cap. Red Cap says, \"Plaster Palacey had a son, whose name was old\r\ndaddy White Cap.\" White Cap, in an injured voice, says, \"Me, sir?\" The\r\nKing says, \"Yes, sir.\" White Cap answers, \"You're a liar, sir.\" The King\r\nthen says, \"Who then, sir?\" White Cap answers, \"Old daddy Red\r\nCap.\"--Deptford, Kent (Miss Chase).\r\n\r\nThe game as given above is obviously incomplete, and no description as\r\nto how the game was played was sent me. Newell (_Games_, p. 145),\r\ndescribes a game, \"The Cardinal's Hat,\" which is probably a variant of\r\nthe original game, of which the above is only a fragment. I remember\r\nonce witnessing a game in which a ball was passed from player to player,\r\nand in which the dialogue was similar. When one player was told that the\r\nball was in his possession, the answer was, \"What, me, sir?\" \"Yes, you,\r\nsir.\" \"Not I, sir.\" \"Who then, sir?\" \"White Cap, sir;\" the questions and\r\nanswers were again repeated for Red Cap, and Blue Cap. When it was Black\r\nCap's turn, I think the ball was thrown by this player to some one else;\r\nwhoever was hit by the ball had to chase and capture one, who became\r\nquestioner; but my recollection of the game is too slight for me to be\r\ncertain either of the dialogue or the way the game terminated (A. B.\r\nGomme). A game described in _Suffolk County Folk-lore_, p. 62, is\r\napparently a version of this. It is there described as a forfeit game.\r\n\r\n\r\nKing William\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Earls Heaton, Yorks. (H. Hardy).\r\n\r\n    I.

(H. Hardy).\r\n\r\n    II.    King William was King David's son,\r\n           All the royal race is run;\r\n           Choose from the east, choose from the west,\r\n           Choose the one that you love best;\r\n           If she's not here to take her part,\r\n           Choose another with all your heart.\r\n\r\n--Sheffield (S. O. Addy).\r\n\r\n(_b_) In Sheffield a ring of young men and women is formed. A man goes\r\ninside the ring and walks round within it, whilst the others sing the\r\nverse. The young man then chooses a sweetheart, and the two walk round\r\narm-in-arm within the ring, whilst the same verses are sung. When the\r\nsinging is ended, the girl picks a young man, and so they all pair off.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Mr. Addy entitles this game \"Kiss in the Ring.\" It appears,\r\nhowever, from this description to lack the two principal elements of\r\nmost \"kiss-in-the-ring\" games--the chase between pursued and pursuer,\r\nand the kissing in the ring when the capture is made. In the Hanging\r\nHeaton version two children kneel and kiss in the middle of the ring.\r\nMr. Newell (_Games_, p. 73), in describing a game with a similar rhyme,\r\nmentions a version which had been sent him from Waterford, Ireland. He\r\nsays, \"We learn from an informant that in her town it was formerly\r\nplayed in this peculiar manner. Over the head of a girl who stood in the\r\ncentre of a ring was held a shawl, sustained by four others grasping the\r\ncorners.\" The game then proceeded as follows--\r\n\r\n    King William was King George's son,\r\n    From the Bay of Biscay O!\r\n    Upon his breast he wore a star--\r\n    Find your way to English schools.\r\n    Down on the carpet you must kneel;\r\n    As the grass grows in the field,\r\n    Salute your bride and kiss her sweet,\r\n    And rise again upon your feet.\r\n\r\nThen followed the game-rhyme, repeated with each stanza--\r\n\r\n    Go choose you east, go choose you west,\r\n\r\napparently the same as last four lines of Sheffield version. King\r\nWilliam is then supposed to enter--\r\n\r\n    The first girl that I loved so dear,\r\n    Can it be she's gone from me?\r\n    If she's not here when the night comes on,\r\n    Will none of you tell me where she's gone?\r\n\r\nHe then recognises the disguised girl--\r\n\r\n    There's heart beneath the willow tree,\r\n    There's no one here but my love and me.\r\n\r\n\"He had gone to the war, and promised to marry her when he came back.\r\nShe wrapped a shawl about her head to see if he would recognise her.\"\r\nThis was all the reciter could recollect; the lines of the ballad were\r\nsung by an old woman, the ring answering with the game-rhyme.\r\n\r\nThis version seems to indicate clearly that in this game\r\nwe have preserved one of the ceremonies of a now obsolete\r\nmarriage-custom--namely, the disguising of the bride and placing her\r\namong her bridesmaids and other young girls, all having veils or other\r\ncoverings alike over their heads and bodies. The bridegroom has to\r\nselect from among these maidens the girl whom he wished to marry, or\r\nwhom he had already married, for until this was done he was not allowed\r\nto depart with his bride. This custom was continued in sport as one of\r\nthe ceremonies to be gone through after the marriage was over, long\r\nafter the custom itself was discontinued. For an instance of this see a\r\n\"Rural Marriage in Lorraine,\" in _Folk-lore Record_, iii. 267-268. This\r\nordeal occurs in more than one folk-tale, and it usually accompanies the\r\nincident of a youth having travelled for adventures, sometimes in quest\r\nof a bride. He succeeds in finding the whereabouts of the coveted girl,\r\nbut before he is allowed by the father to take his bride away he is\r\nrequired to perform tasks, a final one being the choosing of the girl\r\nwith whom he is in love from among others, all dressed alike and\r\ndisguised. Our bridal veil may probably originate in this custom.\r\n\r\nIn the ballad from which Mr. Newell thinks the game may have originated,\r\na maid has been given in marriage to another than her chosen lover. He\r\nrides to the ceremony with a troop of followers; the bride, seeing him\r\napproach, calls on her maidens to \"take off her gold crown and coif her\r\nin linen white,\" to test her bridegroom's affection. This incident, I\r\nthink, is not to test \"affection,\" but the ordeal of recognising his\r\nbride, however disguised, and the fact that \"the hero at once recognises\r\nhis love, mounts with her on horseback, and flees to Norway,\" may be\r\nconsidered to support my view.\r\n\r\nSee also Brand, vol. ii. p. 141, under \"Care Cloth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKing's Chair\r\n\r\nTwo children join hands, by crossing their arms, so as to form a seat. A\r\nthird mounts on the crossed arms, and clasps the carriers round their\r\nnecks, while they move on saying--\r\n\r\n    King, King Cairy (carry)\r\n    London lairy,\r\n    Milk an bread,\r\n    In the King's chairie.\r\n\r\nThis game is played at Keith, without the words. The words are used at\r\nFochabers.--Rev. W. Gregor.\r\n\r\nJamieson says, \"Lothian children, while carrying one of their number in\r\nthis manner, repeat the following rhyme--\r\n\r\n    Lend me a pin to stick i' my thumb,\r\n    To carry the lady to London town.\"\r\n\r\nHe says this method of carrying is often used as a substitute for a\r\nchair in conveying adult persons from one place to another, especially\r\nwhen infirm. In other counties it is called \"Queen's Cushion\" and\r\n\"Queen's Chair,\" also \"Cat's Carriage.\"\r\n\r\nBrockett (_North Country Words_) says, \"'King's Cushion,' a sort of seat\r\nmade by two persons crossing their hands, in which to place a third. The\r\nthrones on the reverses of the early Royal Seals of England and Scotland\r\nconsist of swords, spears, snakes, &c., placed in the manner of a\r\n'King's Cushion.'\"\r\n\r\nThe method used is for both children to grasp the wrist of his left hand\r\nwith the right, while he lays hold of the right wrist of his companion\r\nwith his left hand. This way of hoisting or carrying is still used by\r\nschoolboys when they desire to honour a boy who has distinguished\r\nhimself in the playground or schoolroom.\r\n\r\nSee \"Carry my Lady to London.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKirk the Gussie\r\n\r\nA sort of play.

Potteries (Miss A. A. Keary).\r\n\r\n(_b_) In Dorsetshire a ring is formed by all the players joining hands\r\nexcept one. The odd player, carrying a handkerchief, commences to walk\r\nslowly round the outside of the ring, repeating the words; then,\r\ntouching each one with her handkerchief as she passes, she says, \"Not\r\nyou,\" \"not you,\" \"not you,\" &c., &c., till the favoured individual is\r\nreached, when it is changed to \"But you!\" and his or her shoulder\r\nlightly touched at the same time. The first player then runs round the\r\nring as fast as he can, pursued by the other, who, if a capture is\r\neffected (as is nearly always the case), is entitled to lead the first\r\nplayer back into the centre of the ring and claim a kiss. The first\r\nplayer then takes the other's place in the ring, and in turn walks round\r\nthe outside repeating the same formula.--_Folk-lore Journal_, vii. 212;\r\nPenzance (Mrs. Mabbott).\r\n\r\nIn Shropshire, as soon as the player going round the ring has dropped\r\nthe handkerchief on the shoulder of the girl he chooses, both players\r\nrun _opposite ways_ outside the ring, each trying to be the first to\r\nregain the starting-point. If the one who was chosen gets there first,\r\nno kiss can be claimed. It is often called \"Drop-handkerchief,\" from the\r\nsignal for the chase. The more general way of playing (either with or\r\nwithout words), as seen by me on village greens round London, is, when\r\nthe handkerchief has been dropped, for the player to dart through the\r\nring and in and out again under the clasped hands; the pursuer must\r\nfollow in and out through the same places, and must bring the one he\r\ncatches into the ring before he can legally claim the kiss.\r\n\r\nElworthy (_West Country Words_), in describing this game, says: \"The\r\nperson behind whom the handkerchief is dropped is entitled to kiss the\r\nperson who dropped it, if he or she can catch him or her, before the\r\nperson can get round the ring to the vacant place. Of course, when a\r\ngirl drops it she selects a favoured swain, and the chase is severe up\r\nto a point, but when a girl is the pursuer there often is a kind of\r\ndonkey race lest she should have to give the kiss which the lad takes no\r\npains to avoid.\" Mr. Elworthy does not mention any words being used, and\r\nit is therefore probable that this is the \"Drop-handkerchief\" game,\r\nwhich generally has no kissing. It also, in the way it is played,\r\nresembles \"French Jackie.\" In the Wolstanton game, Miss Keary says: \"If\r\nthe owner of the handkerchief overtakes the one who is bitten as they\r\nrun round, they shake hands and go into the middle of the ring, while\r\nthe others sing the marriage formula.\" In Berkshire (_Antiq._ xxvii.\r\n255) the game is played without words, and apparently no handkerchief or\r\nother sign is used. Miss Thoyts says the young man raises his hat when\r\nhe embraces the young woman of his choice. To \"throw (or fling) the\r\nhandkerchief\" is a common expression for an expected proposal of\r\nmarriage which is more of a condescension than a complimentary or\r\nflattering one to the girl. \"Kiss in the Ring\" is probably a relic of\r\nthe earliest form of marriage by choice or selection. The custom of\r\ndropping or sending a glove as the signal of a challenge may have been\r\nsucceeded by the handkerchief in this game. Halliwell, p. 227, gives the\r\ngame of \"Drop Glove,\" in which a glove is used. For the use of\r\nhandkerchiefs as love-tokens see Brand, ii. 92.\r\n\r\nSee \"Drop Handkerchief,\" \"French Jackie.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKit-Cat\r\n\r\nA game played by boys. Three small holes are made in the ground,\r\ntriangularly about twenty feet apart, to mark the position of as many\r\nboys, each of whom holds a small stick, about two feet long. Three other\r\nboys of the adverse side pitch successively a piece of stick, a little\r\nbigger than one's thumb, called Cat, to be struck by those holding the\r\nsticks. On its being struck, the boys run from hole to hole, dipping the\r\nends of their sticks in as they pass, and counting one, two, three, &c.,\r\nas they do so, up to thirty-one, which is game. Or the greater number of\r\nholes gained in the innings may indicate the winners, as at cricket. If\r\nthe Cat be struck and caught, the striking party is out, and another of\r\nhis sidesmen takes his place, if the set be strong enough to admit of\r\nit. If there be only six players, it may be previously agreed that three\r\n_put outs_ shall end the innings. Another mode of putting out is to\r\nthrow the Cat home, after being struck, and placing or pitching it into\r\nan unoccupied hole, while the in-party are running. A certain number of\r\nmisses (not striking the Cat) may be agreed on to be equivalent to a put\r\nout. The game may be played by two, placed as at cricket, or by four,\r\nor I believe more.--Moor's _Suffolk Words_; Holloway's _Dict. of\r\nProvincialisms_.\r\n\r\nBrockett (_North Country Words_, p. 115) calls this \"'Kitty-Cat,' a\r\npuerile game.\r\n\r\n    Then in his hand he takes a thick bat,\r\n    With which he used to play at 'Kit-Cat'\"\r\n\r\n--Cotton's _Works_, 1734, p. 88.\r\n\r\nSee \"Cat and Dog,\" \"Cudgel,\" \"Munshets,\" \"Tip-Cat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKit-Cat-Cannio\r\n\r\nA sedentary game, played by two, with slate and pencil, or pencil and\r\npaper. It is won by the party who can first get three marks ([o]'s or\r\n[x]'s) in a line; the marks being made alternately by the players [o] or\r\n[x] in one of the nine spots equidistant in three rows, when complete.\r\nHe who begins has the advantage, as he can contrive to get his mark in\r\nthe middle.--Moor's _Suffolk Words_.\r\n\r\nThe same game as \"Nought and Crosses,\" which see.\r\n\r\n\r\nKittlie-cout\r\n\r\nA game mentioned but not described by a writer in _Blackwood's\r\nMagazine_, August 1821, as played in Edinburgh.

He runs hither and thither till one or other of the two gets\r\ntired.--Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\n\r\nKnights\r\n\r\nTwo big boys take two smaller ones on their shoulders. The big boys act\r\nas horses, while the younger ones seated on their shoulders try to pull\r\neach other over. The \"horses\" may push and strike each other with their\r\nshoulders, but must not kick or trip up with their feet, or use their\r\nhands or elbows. The game is usually won by the Horse and Knight who\r\nthrow their opponents twice out of three times (G. L. Gomme). Strutt\r\n(_Sports_, p. 84) describes this, and says, \"A sport of this kind was in\r\npractice with us at the commencement of the fourteenth century.\" He\r\nconsiders it to bear more analogy to wrestling than to any other sport.\r\nHe gives illustrations, one of which is here reproduced from the\r\noriginal MS. in the British Museum. The game is also described in the\r\nRev. J. G. Wood's _Modern Playmate_, p. 12.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nKnocked at the Rapper\r\n\r\nThe girl who spoke of this game, says Miss Peacock, could only remember\r\nits details imperfectly, but as far as she recollects it is played as\r\nfollows:--The players dance round a centre child, leaving one of their\r\nnumber outside the circle. The dancers sing to the one in their midst--\r\n\r\n    Here comes ----,\r\n    He knocked at the rapper, and he pulled at the string,\r\n    Pray, Mrs. ----, is ---- within?\r\n\r\nAt \"is ---- within,\" the child outside the circle is named. The centre\r\nchild says--\r\n\r\n    O no, she has gone into the town:\r\n    Pray take the arm-chair and sit yourself down.\r\n\r\nThe ring of children then sing--\r\n\r\n    O no, not until my dearest I see,\r\n    And then one chair will do for we.\r\n\r\nThen all sing--\r\n\r\n    My elbow, my elbow,\r\n    My pitcher, and my can:\r\n    Isn't ---- ---- a nice young girl?\r\n\r\nMentioning the supposed sweetheart.\r\n\r\n    Isn't ---- ---- as nice as she?\r\n\r\nMentioning the outside child.\r\n\r\n    They shall be married when they can agree.\r\n\r\nThen the inside and outside children each choose a companion from the\r\ncircle, and the rest repeat:--\r\n\r\n    My elbow, my elbow, &c.\r\n\r\nWhen the words have been sung a second time, the four children kiss, and\r\nthe two from the circle take the places of the other, after which change\r\nthe game begins again.--North Kelsey, Lincolnshire (Miss M.

Down (Miss C. N. Patterson).\r\n\r\n(_b_) The first Dorsetshire game is played as follows:--Two girls are\r\nchosen, the one to represent a lady and the other a mother, who is\r\nsupposed to be taking her children out to service. She has one or more\r\nof them in each hand, and leads them up to the lady, saying or singing\r\nthe first verse. The dialogue then proceeds, and the verse is repeated\r\nuntil all the children are similarly disposed of. A few days are\r\nsupposed to pass, after which the mother calls to see her children, when\r\nthe lady tells her she cannot see them. At last she insists upon seeing\r\nthem, and the children are all \"sat down\" behind the lady, and the\r\nmother asks one child what the lady has done to her; and she tells her\r\n\"that the lady has cut off her nose, and made a nose-pie, and never give\r\nher a bit of it.\" Each one says she has done something to her and made a\r\npie, and when all have told their tale \"they all turn on her and put her\r\nto prison.\"\r\n\r\nThe second Dorsetshire game somewhat differs. One child takes seven or\r\neight others whom she pretends are her children. Another child,\r\npresumably a mistress in want of servants, stands at a distance. The\r\nfirst child advances, holding the hand of her children, saying the first\r\nverse. The dialogue is concluded, and as the woman and her children are\r\nsupposed to be out of hearing, the last couplet is said or sung. This\r\nprocess is gone through again until the mistress has engaged all the\r\nchildren as her servants, when she is supposed to let them all out to\r\nplay with the mustard pots, which are represented by sticks or stones,\r\nin their hands.\r\n\r\nThe other versions are played as follows:--The children form a line, the\r\none in the middle being the mother, or widow; they advance and retire,\r\nthe mother alone singing the first verse. One child, who is standing\r\nalone on the opposite side, who has been addressed by the widow, then\r\nasks [not sings] the question. The mother, or widow, sings the reply,\r\nand points to one child when singing the last line, who thereupon\r\ncrosses over to the other side, joining the one who is standing alone.\r\nThis is continued till all have been selected. The Ballynascaw version\r\n(Miss Patterson) is played in a similar way. One child sits on a bank,\r\nand the others come up to her in a long line. The \"old woman\" says the\r\nfirst five lines. No question is asked by the \"lady,\" she simply takes\r\none child. The \"old woman\" shakes hands with this child, and says\r\ngood-bye to her. When all the children have been \"taken in\" by the one\r\nwho personates the \"lady,\" the \"old woman\" says the other three lines,\r\nand so one by one gets all the children back again. The Berkshire\r\nversion (Miss Thoyts) is said, not sung, and is played with two leaders,\r\n\"old woman\" and \"lover.\" As the lover chooses a child, that one is sent\r\nbehind him, holding round his waist. Each child as she goes says,\r\n\"Good-bye, mother, good-bye,\" and pretends to cry. Finally they all cry,\r\nand the game ends in a tug of war. This tug is clearly out of place\r\nunless only half the children are selected by one side. Miss Thoyts does\r\nnot say how this is done.\r\n\r\n(_c_) This game is called \"School-teacher\" in Belfast. The corruption of\r\n\"Lady of the Land,\" to \"Babyland,\" \"Babylon,\" and \"Sandiland,\" is\r\nmanifest. It appears to be only fragmentary in its present form, but the\r\nversions undoubtedly indicate that the origin of the game arises from\r\nthe practice of hiring servants. Mr. Halliwell has preserved another\r\nfragmentary rhyme, which he thinks may belong to this game.\r\n\r\n    I can make diet bread\r\n      Thick and thin,\r\n    I can make diet bread\r\n      Fit for the king; (No. cccxliv.)\r\n\r\nwhich may be compared with the rhyme given by Chambers (_Popular\r\nRhymes_, p. 136), and another version given by Halliwell, p. 229.\r\n\r\nIf these rhymes belong to this game it would have probably been played\r\nby each child singing a verse descriptive of her own qualifications, and\r\nI have some recollection, although not perfect, of having played a game\r\nlike this in London, where each child stated her ability to either brew,\r\nbake, or churn. It is worth noting that the Forest of Dean and Berkshire\r\nversions have absorbed one of the \"selection\" verses of the love-games.\r\nMr. Halliwell, in recording the _Nursery Rhymes_, Nos. cccxliii. and\r\ncccxliv., as quoted above, says, \"They are fragments of a game called\r\n'The Lady of the Land,' a complete version of which has not fallen in my\r\nway.\" Mr. Udal's versions from Dorsetshire are not only called \"The Lady\r\nof the Land,\" but are fuller than all the other versions, though\r\nprobably these are not complete. Mr. Newell (_Games_, pp. 56-58) gives\r\nsome versions of this game. He considers the original to have been a\r\nEuropean game (he had not found an English example) in which there were\r\ntwo mothers, a rich and a poor one; one mother begging away, one by one,\r\nall the daughters of the other.\r\n\r\n(_d_) This game no doubt originates from the country practice of hiring\r\nservants at fairs, or from a dramatic \"Hirings\" being acted at Harvest\r\nHomes. The \"Good-bye\" of mother and daughters belongs, no doubt, to the\r\noriginal game and early versions, and is consistent with the departure\r\nof a servant to her new home. The \"lover\" incident is an interpolation,\r\nbut there may have been a request on the part of the \"mother\" to the\r\n\"lady\" not to allow the girl followers or sweethearts too soon. As to\r\nthe old practice of hiring servants, Miss Burne has noted how distinctly\r\nit stamps itself upon local custom (_Shropshire Folklore_, pp. 461,\r\n464). That the practice forms the groundwork of this game is well\r\nillustrated by the following descriptive passage. \"They stay usually two\r\nor three dayes with theire friends, and then aboute the fifth or sixth\r\nday after Martynmasse will they come to theire newe masters; they will\r\ndepart from theire olde services any day in the weeke, but theire desire\r\n(hereaboutes) is to goe to theire newe masters eyther on a Tewsday or on\r\na Thursday; for on a Sunday they will seldome remoove, and as for\r\nMonday, they account it ominous, for they say--\r\n\r\n    Monday flitte,\r\n    Neaver sitte;\r\n\r\nbut as for the other dayes in the weeke they make no greate matter. I\r\nheard a servant asked what hee could doe, whoe made this answeare--\r\n\r\n      I can sowe,\r\n      I can mowe,\r\n    And I can stacke;\r\n      And I can doe,\r\n      My master too,\r\n    When my master turnes his backe.\"\r\n\r\n--Best's _Rural Economy of Yorks._, 1641; _Surtees Society_, pp.\r\n135-136.\r\n\r\nIn _Long Ago_, ii. 130, Mr. Scarlett Potter mentions that in South\r\nWarwickshire it was customary at harvest-homes to give a kind of\r\ndramatic performance. One piece, called \"The Hiring,\" represents a\r\nfarmer engaging a man, in which work done by the man, the terms of\r\nservice, and food to be supplied, are stated in rhymes similar to the\r\nabove.

The ring sing the first\r\nverse, and then the centre child chooses one from the ring. The chosen\r\npair kiss when the ring has sung the second. The first child then joins\r\nthe ring, and the game begins again. In the Barnes version the centre\r\nchild calls one to her from the ring by singing the second verse and\r\nnaming the child she chooses.\r\n\r\n(_c_) A version from Lady C. Gurdon's _Suffolk County Folk-lore_ (p. 62)\r\nis the same as previous versions, except that it ends--\r\n\r\n    Now you're married you must be good\r\n    Make your husband chop the wood;\r\n    Chop it fine and bring it in,\r\n    Give three kisses in the ring.\r\n\r\nOther versions are much the same as the examples given.\r\n\r\n(_d_) This game has probably had its origin in a ballad. Miss Burne\r\ndraws attention to its resemblance to the \"Disdainful Lady\" (_Shropshire\r\nFolk-lore_, p. 561), and Halliwell mentions a nursery rhyme (No.\r\ncccclxxix.) which is very similar. Mr. Newell (_Games_, p. 55) prints\r\nwords and tune of a song which is very similar to that ballad, and he\r\nmentions the fact that he has seen it played as a round by the \"Arabs of\r\nthe street.\" He considers it to be an old English song which has been\r\nfitted for a ring game by the addition of a verse.\r\n\r\nSee \"Lady on Yonder Hill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLady on Yonder Hill\r\n\r\n    I.     Yonder stands a lovely lady,\r\n           Whom she be I do not know;\r\n           I'll go court her for my beauty,\r\n           Whether she say me yea or nay.\r\n           Madam, to thee I humbly bow and bend.\r\n           Sir, I take thee not to be my friend.\r\n           Oh, if the good fairy doesn't come I shall die.\r\n\r\n--Derbyshire (_Folk-lore Journal_, i. 387).\r\n\r\n    II.    There stands a lady on yonder hill,\r\n           Who she is I cannot tell;\r\n           I'll go and court her for her beauty,\r\n           Whether she answers me yes or no.\r\n           Madam, I bow vounce to thee.\r\n           Sir, have I done thee any harm?\r\n           Coxconian!\r\n           Coxconian is not my name; 'tis Hers and Kers, and Willis and\r\n             Cave.\r\n           Stab me, ha! ha! little I fear. Over the waters there are but\r\n             nine, I'll meet you a man alive. Over the waters there are\r\n             but ten, I'll meet you there five thousand.\r\n           Rise up, rise up, my pretty fair maid,\r\n           You're only in a trance;\r\n           Rise up, rise up, my pretty fair maid,\r\n           And we will have a dance.\r\n\r\n--Lady C. Gurdon's _Suffolk County Folk-lore_, p. 65.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In the Suffolk game the children form a ring, a boy and girl being\r\nin the centre. The boy is called a gentleman and the girl a lady. The\r\ngentleman commences by singing the first verse. Then they say\r\nalternately the questions and answers. When the gentleman says the lines\r\ncommencing, \"Stab me,\" he pretends to stab the lady, who falls on the\r\nground. Then he walks round the lady and sings the last verse, \"Rise\r\nup,\" and lifts up the lady. In the Derbyshire game only three children\r\nplay, the lover, lady, and fairy. The girl stands a little distance off.\r\nThe lover says the first four lines, then approaches the lady, falls on\r\none knee, and says the next line. The lady replies, and retires further\r\naway. The lover then falls on the ground and says the next line. As this\r\nis said the good fairy appears, touches the fallen lover with her hand,\r\nand he is immediately well again.\r\n\r\n(_c_) This is a curious game, and is perhaps derived from a ballad which\r\nhad been popular from some more or less local circumstance, or more\r\nprobably it may be a portion of an old play acted in booths at fair\r\ntimes by strolling players. It is not, as far as I can find out, played\r\nin any other counties. The lines--\r\n\r\n    Over the water at the hour of ten,\r\n      I'll meet you with five thousand men;\r\n    Over the water at the hour of five,\r\n      I'll meet you there if I'm alive,\r\n\r\nare portions of a dialogue familiar to Mr. Emslie, and also occur in\r\nsome mumming plays. It may also be noted that the curing of illness or\r\ndeath from a stab is an incident in these plays, as is also the method\r\nof playing. The first lines are similar to those of \"Lady on the\r\nMountain,\" which see.\r\n\r\n\r\nLag\r\n\r\nA number of boys put marbles in a ring, and then they all bowl at the\r\nring. The one who gets nearest has the first shot at the marbles. He has\r\nthe option of either \"knuckling doon\" and shooting at the ring from the\r\nprescribed mark, or \"ligging up\" (lying up)--that is, putting his taw so\r\nnear the ring that if the others miss his taw, or miss the marbles in\r\nthe ring, he has the game all to himself next time. If, however, he is\r\nhit by the others, he is said to be \"killed.\"--Addy's _Sheffield\r\nGlossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLammas\r\n\r\nA party of boys take a few straws, and endeavour to hold one between\r\nthe chin and the turned-down under-lip, pronouncing the following\r\nrhyme--\r\n\r\n    I bought a beard at Lammas fair,\r\n    It's a' awa' but ae hair;\r\n        Wag, beardie, wag!\r\n\r\nHe who repeats this oftenest without dropping the straw is held to have\r\nwon the game (Chambers' _Popular Rhymes_, p. 115). This game-rhyme has\r\nan interesting reference to Lammas, and it may also refer to the hiring\r\nof servants. Brockett (_North Country Words_, p. 221) says, \"At a fair\r\nor market where country servants are hired, those who offer themselves\r\nstand in the market-place with a piece of straw or green branch in their\r\nmouths to distinguish them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLamploo\r\n\r\nA goal having been selected and bounds determined, the promoters used to\r\nprepare the others by calling at the top of their voices--\r\n\r\n    Lamp! Lamp! Laa-o!\r\n    Those that don't run shan't play-o!\r\n\r\nThen one of the \"spryest\" lads is elected to commence, thus:--First\r\ntouching the goal with his foot or leaning against it, and clasping his\r\nhands so as to produce the letter W in the dumb alphabet, he pursues the\r\nother players, who are not so handicapped, when, if he succeeds in\r\ntouching one without unclasping his hands, they both make a rush for the\r\ngoal. Should either of the other boys succeed in overtaking one of these\r\nbefore reaching that spot, he has the privilege of riding him home\r\npick-a-back. Then these two boys (_i.e._, the original pursuer and the\r\none caught), joining hands, carry on the game as before, incurring a\r\nsimilar penalty in case of being overtaken as already described. Each\r\nsuccessive boy, as he is touched by the pursuers, has to make for the\r\ngoal under similar risks, afterwards clasping hands with the rest, and\r\nforming a new recruit in the pursuing gang, in whose chain the outside\r\nplayers alone have the privilege of touching and thus adding to their\r\nnumbers. Should the chain at any time be broken, or should the original\r\npursuer unclasp his hands, either by design or accident, the penalty of\r\ncarrying a capturer to the goal is incurred and always enforced. In West\r\nSomerset the pursuing boys after starting were in the habit of crying\r\nout the word \"Brewerre\" or \"Brewarre;\" noise appearing to be quite as\r\nessential to the game as speed.--_Somerset and Dorset Notes and\r\nQueries_, i. 186 (1888).\r\n\r\nAnother correspondent to the same periodical (i. 204) says that an\r\nalmost identical game was played at the King's School, Sherborne, some\r\nfifty years ago. It was called \"King-sealing,\" and the pursuing boy was\r\nobliged by the rules to retain his hold of the boy seized until he had\r\nuttered--\r\n\r\n    One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.\r\n    You are one of the king-sealer's men.\r\n\r\nIf the latter succeeded in breaking away before the couplet was\r\nfinished, the capture was incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe second game described is almost identical with \"King Cæsar,\" played\r\nat Barnes.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty years ago the game was common in some parts of Bedfordshire\r\nand Hertfordshire, where it was sometimes called \"Chevy\r\nChase.\"--_Folk-lore Journal_, vii. 233.\r\n\r\nSee \"Chickidy Hand,\" \"Hunt the Staigie,\" \"King Cæsar,\" \"Whiddy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLang Larence\r\n\r\nThat is, \"Long Lawrence,\" an instrument marked with signs, a sort of\r\nteetotum. A \"Long Lawrence\" is about three inches long, something like a\r\nshort ruler with eight sides; occasionally they have but four. On one\r\nside are ten x's, or crosses, forming a kind of lattice-work; on the\r\nnext, to the left, three double cuts, or strokes, passing straight\r\nacross in the direction of the breadth; on the third, a zig-zag of three\r\nstrokes one way, and two or three the other, forming a W, with an\r\nadditional stroke or a triple V; on the fourth, three single bars, one\r\nat each end and one in the middle, as in No. 2, where they are doubled;\r\nthen the four devices are repeated in the same order. The game, formerly\r\npopular at Christmas, can be played by any number of persons. Each has a\r\nbank of pins or other small matters. A pool is formed; then in turn each\r\nrolls the \"Long Lawrence.\" If No. 1 comes up the player cries \"Flush,\"\r\nand takes the pool; if No. 2, he puts down two pins; if No. 3, he says\r\n\"Lave all,\" and neither takes nor gives; if No. 4, he picks up one. The\r\nsides are considered to bear the names, \"Flush,\" \"Put doan two,\" \"Lave\r\nall,\" \"Sam up one.\" It has been suggested that the name \"Lawrence\" may\r\nhave arisen from the marks scored on the instrument, not unlike the bars\r\nof a gridiron, on which the saint perished.--_Easthers's Almondbury\r\nGlossary._\r\n\r\nSee \"Teetotum.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLeap Candle\r\n\r\nThe young girls in and about Oxford have a sport called \"Leap Candle,\"\r\nfor which they set a candle in the middle of a room in a candlestick,\r\nand then draw up their coats into the form of breeches, and dance over\r\nthe candle back and forth, saying the words--\r\n\r\n    The taylor of Bicester he has but one eye,\r\n    He cannot cut a pair of green galagaskins\r\n    If he were to die.\r\n\r\nThis sport, in other parts, is called \"Dancing the Candlerush\" (Aubrey's\r\n_Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme_, p. 45). Halliwell (_Rhymes_, p.\r\n65) has a rhyme--\r\n\r\n    Jack be nimble,\r\n    And Jack be quick,\r\n    And Jack jump over\r\n    The candlestick,\r\n\r\nwhich may refer to this game. Northall (_Folk Rhymes_, p. 412) says in\r\nWarwickshire a similar game is called \"Cock and Breeches.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLeap-frog\r\n\r\nOne boy stoops down sideways, with his head bent towards his body, as\r\nlow as possible. This is called \"Tucking in your Tuppeny.\" Another boy\r\ntakes a flying leap over the \"frog,\" placing his hands on his back to\r\nhelp himself over. He then proceeds to a distance of some four or five\r\nyards, and, in his turn, stoops in the same manner as the first boy, as\r\nanother frog. A third boy then leaps first over frog No. 1, and then\r\nover frog No. 2, taking his place as frog No. 3, at about the same\r\ndistance onwards. Any number of boys may play in the game. After the\r\nlast player has taken his leap over all the frogs successively, frog No.\r\n1 has his turn and leaps over his companions, taking his place as the\r\nlast in the line of frogs. Then No. 2 follows suit, and so on, the whole\r\nline of players in course of time covering a good distance.--London (G.\r\nL. Gomme).\r\n\r\nLeap-frog is known in Cornwall as \"Leap the Long-mare\" (_Folk-lore\r\nJournal_, v. 60), and in Antrim and Down as \"Leap the Bullock\"\r\n(Patterson's _Glossary_).\r\n\r\nSee \"Accroshay,\" \"Loup the Bullocks,\" \"Spanish Fly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLeap the Bullock\r\n\r\nSee \"Leap-frog,\" \"Loup the Bullocks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaves are Green\r\n\r\n    The leaves are green, the nuts are brown,\r\n    They hang so high they will not come down;\r\n    Leave them alone till frosty weather,\r\n    Then they will all come down together.\r\n\r\n--Berkshire (Miss Thoyts, _Antiquary_, xxvii. 254).\r\n\r\nThese lines are sung while the children dance round in a circle. When\r\nthe last words are sung, the children flop down upon the ground. The\r\ntune sung is, Miss Thoyts says, that of \"Nuts in May.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLend Me your Key\r\n\r\n    Please will you lend us your key?\r\n    What for?\r\n    Please, our hats are in the garden.\r\n    Yes, if you won't steal any beans.\r\n    Please, we've brought the key back; will you lend us your\r\n      frying-pan?\r\n    What to do with?\r\n    To fry some beans.\r\n    Where have you got them?\r\n    Out of your garden.\r\n\r\n--Earls Heaton (H. Hardy).\r\n\r\nOne child represents an old woman, and the other players carry on the\r\ndialogue with her. At the end of the dialogue the children are chased by\r\nthe old woman.\r\n\r\nSee \"Mother, Mother, may I go out to Play,\" \"Witch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLetting the Buck out\r\n\r\nThis game was played seventy years ago. A ring being formed, the \"Buck\"\r\ninside has to break out, and reach his \"home,\" crying \"Home!\" before he\r\ncan be caught and surrounded. Afterwards these words were sung--\r\n\r\n    Circle: Who comes here?\r\n\r\n    Buck:   Poor Johnny Lingo.\r\n\r\n    Circle: Don't steal none of my black sheep, Johnny Lingo,\r\n            For if you do\r\n            I shall put you in the pinder pin-fold.\r\n\r\n--Stixwold, Lines. (Miss M. Peacock).\r\n\r\nSee \"Who goes round my Stone Wall?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLevel-coil\r\n\r\nNares, in his _Glossary_, says this is \"a game of which we seem to know\r\nno more than that the loser in it was to give up his place to be\r\noccupied by another.\" Minshew gives it thus: \"To play at _levell coil_,\r\nG. jouer à cul levé: _i.e._, to play and lift up your taile when you\r\nhave lost the game, and let another sit down in your place.\" Coles, in\r\nhis _English Dictionary_, seems to derive it from the Italian _leva il\r\nculo_, and calls it also \"Pitch-buttock.\" In his _Latin Dictionary_ he\r\nhas \"_level-coil_, alternation, cession;\" and \"to play at _level coil_,\r\nvices ludendi præbere.\" Skinner is a little more particular and says,\r\n\"Vox tesseris globulosis ludentium propria:\" an expression belonging to\r\na game played with little round tesseræ. He also derives it from French\r\nand Italian. It is mentioned by Jonson, _Tale of a Tub_, iii. 2:--\r\n\r\n    \"Young Justice Bramble has kept _level-coyl_\r\n    Here in our quarters, stole away our daughter.\"\r\n\r\nGifford says that, in our old dramatists, it implies riot and\r\ndisturbance. The same sport is mentioned by Sylvester, _Dubartas_, IV.\r\niv. 2, under the name of _level-sice_:--\r\n\r\n             \"By tragick death's device\r\n    Ambitious hearts do play at _level-sice_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the margin we have this explanation: \"A kinde of Christmas play,\r\nwherein each hunteth the other from his seat. The name seems derived\r\nfrom the French _levez sus_, in English, arise up.\" Halliwell's\r\n_Dictionary_ says that Skelton, ii. 31, spells it _levell suse_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLibbety, Libbety, Libbety-lat\r\n\r\nA child stands before a hassock, and as if he were going up stairs, he\r\nputs on it first his right and then his left foot, gradually quickening\r\nhis steps, keeping time to the words--\r\n\r\n    Libbety, libbety, libbety-lat,\r\n    Who can do this? and who can do that?\r\n    And who can do anything better than that?\r\n\r\n--Cornwall (_Folk-lore Journal_, v. 59).\r\n\r\n\r\nLimpy Coley\r\n\r\nA boy's game undescribed.--Patterson's _Antrim and Down Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Dog I call you\r\n\r\nA number of girls stand in a line with their backs to a wall. One of\r\ntheir number is sent away to a distance, but remains within call.\r\nAnother girl, who stands in front of the line, asks the girls one by one\r\nwhat they would like if they could obtain their desires. After she has\r\nasked every one, she tells them to turn their faces to the wall, and\r\ncalls after the girl who was sent away, saying, \"Little Dog, I call\r\nyou.\" The girl replies, \"I shan't come to please you.\" \"I'll get a stick\r\nand make you,\" is the rejoinder. \"I don't care for that.\" \"I've got a\r\nrice pudding for you.\" \"I shan't come for that.\" \"I've got a dish of\r\nbones.\" \"I'll come for that.\" The Dog then comes. The girls have been\r\npreviously told not to laugh whilst the one who stands out is talking to\r\nthe Dog. Then the girl says to the Dog--\r\n\r\n    All the birds in the air,\r\n    All the fishes in the sea,\r\n    Come and pick me out (for example)\r\n    The girl with the golden ball.\r\n\r\nIf the girl who desired the golden ball laughs, the Dog picks her out.\r\nIf nobody laughs, he guesses who the girl is that has wished for the\r\ngolden ball. If the Dog guesses correctly, she goes and stands behind\r\nhim, and if he guesses incorrectly she goes and stands behind the one\r\nwho has been asking the questions. They continue this until they get to\r\nthe last girl or girl at the end of the row, who _must_ have desired to\r\nbe--\r\n\r\n    A brewer or a baker,\r\n    Or a candlestick maker,\r\n    Or a penknife maker.\r\n\r\nThen the questioner says--\r\n\r\n    All the birds in the air,\r\n    All the fishes in the sea,\r\n    Come pick me out\r\n    A brewer or a baker,\r\n    Or a candlestick maker,\r\n    Or penknife maker.\r\n\r\nIf the Dog guesses the right one, he takes that girl on his side, she\r\nstanding behind him. Then they draw a line and each side tries to pull\r\nthe other over it.--Sheffield (S. O. Addy). The game, it will be seen,\r\ndiffers in several ways from the other games of \"Fool, Fool, come to\r\nSchool\" type. The \"fool\" becomes a definite Dog, and the players _wish_\r\nfor any thing they choose; the Dog has apparently to find out their\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\nSee \"All the Birds,\" \"Fool, Fool.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLobber\r\n\r\nThere are three or more players on each side, two stones or holes as\r\nstations, and one Lobber. The Lobber lobs either a stick about three\r\ninches long or a ball--(the ball seems to be a new institution, as a\r\nstick was always formerly used)--while the batsman defends the stone or\r\nhole with either a short stick or his hand. Every time the stick or ball\r\nis hit, the boys defending the stones or holes must change places. Each\r\none is out if the stick or ball lodges in the hole or hits the stone; or\r\nif the ball or stone is caught; or if it can be put in the hole or hits\r\nthe stone while the boys are changing places. This game is also played\r\nwith two Lobbers, that lob alternately from each end. The game is won by\r\na certain number of runs.--Ireland (_Folk-lore Journal_, ii. 264).\r\n\r\nSee \"Cat,\" \"Cudgel,\" \"Kit-Cat,\" \"Rounders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLoggats\r\n\r\nAn old game, forbidden by statute in Henry VIII.'s time. It is thus\r\nplayed, according to Stevens. A stake is fixed in the ground; those who\r\nplay throw Loggats at it, and he that is nearest the stake wins.\r\nLoggats, or loggets, are also small pieces or logs of wood, such as the\r\ncountry people throw at fruit that cannot otherwise be reached.\r\n\"Loggats, little logs or wooden pins, a play the same with ninepins, in\r\nwhich the boys, however, often made use of bones instead of wooden pins\"\r\n(Dean Miles' MS.; Halliwell's _Dictionary_). Strutt refers to this game\r\n(_Sports_, p. 272).\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon\r\n\r\nA diagram (similar to Fig. 9 in \"Hopscotch\") is drawn on a slate, and\r\ntwo children play. A piece of paper or small piece of glass or china,\r\ncalled a \"chipper,\" is used to play with. This is placed at the bottom\r\nof the plan, and if of _paper_, is _blown_ gently towards the top; if of\r\nglass or china, it is _nicked_ with the _fingers_. The first player\r\nblows the paper, and in whichever space the paper stops makes a small\r\nround [o] with a slate pencil, to represent a man's head. The paper or\r\nchipper is then put into the starting-place again, and the same player\r\nblows, and makes another \"man's head\" in the space where the paper\r\nstops. This is continued until all the spaces are occupied. If the paper\r\ngoes a second time into a space already occupied by a \"head,\" the player\r\nadds a larger round to the \"head,\" to represent a \"body;\" if a third\r\ntime, a stroke is drawn for a leg, and if a fourth time, another is\r\nadded for the second leg; this completes a \"man.\" If three complete men\r\nin one space can be gained, the player makes \"arms;\" that is, two lines\r\nare drawn from the figures across the space to the opposite side of the\r\nplan. This occupies that space, and prevents the other player from\r\nputting any \"men\" in it, or adding to any already there. When all the\r\nspaces are thus occupied by one player, the game is won. Should the\r\npaper be blown on to a line or _outside_ the plan, the player is out;\r\nthe other player then begins, and makes as many \"men\" in her turn, until\r\nshe goes on a line or outside. Should the paper go into \"London,\" the\r\nplayer is entitled to make a \"head\" in every space, or to add another\r\nmark to those already there.--Westminster (A. B. Gomme). This game\r\nresembles one described by F. H. Low in _Strand Mag._, ii. 516.\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon Bridge\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Wrotham, Kent (Miss D.

Chase).\r\n\r\n(_b_) This game is now generally played like \"Oranges and Lemons,\" only\r\nthere is no \"tug-of-war\" at the end. Two children hold up their clasped\r\nhands to form an arch. The other children form a long line by holding to\r\neach other's dresses or waists, and run under. Those who are running\r\nunder sing the first verse; the two who form the arch sing the second\r\nand alternate verses. At the words, \"What has this poor prisoner done?\"\r\nthe girls who form the arch catch one of the line (generally the last\r\none). When the last verse is sung the prisoner is taken a little\r\ndistance away, and the game begins again. At Clun the players form a\r\nring, moving round. They sing the first and alternate verses, and\r\nchorus, \"London Bridge is broken down.\" Two players outside the ring run\r\nround it, singing the second and alternate verses. When singing \"Penny\r\nloaves'll get stole away,\" one of the two outside children goes into the\r\nring, the other remains and continues her part, singing the next verse.\r\nWhen the last verse is sung the prisoner is released. The Berkshire game\r\n(Miss Kimber) is played by the children forming two long lines, each\r\nline advancing and retiring alternately while singing their parts. When\r\nthe last verse is begun the children form a ring and gallop around, all\r\nsinging this last verse together. In the Cork version (Mrs. Green) the\r\nchildren form a circle by joining hands. They march round and round,\r\nsinging the verses to a sing-song tune. When singing, \"If the cock\r\nshould meet a hen,\" they all unclasp hands; two hold each other's hands\r\nand form an arch. The rest run under, saying the last verse. The \"arch\"\r\nlower their hands and try to catch the last child.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The analysis of the game-rhymes is on pp. 342-45. It appears from\r\nthis analysis that the London version is alone in its faithful\r\nreflection of an actual building episode. Three other versions introduce\r\nthe incident of watching by a man, and failing him, a dog or cock; while\r\nfive versions introduce a prisoner. This incident occurs the greatest\r\nnumber of times. It is not surprising that the London version seems to\r\nbe the most akin to modern facts, being told so near the spot indicated\r\nby the verses, and on this account it cannot be considered as the oldest\r\nof the variants. There remain the other two groups. Both are\r\ndistinguished by the introduction of a human element, one as watchman,\r\nthe other as prisoner. The watchman incident approaches nearer to modern\r\nfacts; the prisoner incident remains unexplained by any appeal to modern\r\nlife, and it occurs more frequently than the others. In only one case,\r\nthe Shropshire, is the prisoner ransomed; in the others he is sent to\r\nprison. Besides this main line of criticism brought out by the analysis\r\nthere is little to note. The Hurstmonceux version begins with taking\r\nlambs over London Bridge, and the Shropshire version with the players\r\nthemselves going over; but these are doubtless foreign adjuncts, because\r\nthey do not properly prefix the main incident of the bridge being\r\nbroken. The Belfast version has a curious line, \"Grant said the little\r\nbee or dee,\" which the Cork version renders, \"Gran says the little D.\"\r\nTo these there is now no meaning that can be traced, but they help to\r\nprove that the rhyme originated from a state of things not understood by\r\nmodern players. In all the versions with the prisoner incident it comes\r\nquite suddenly, without any previous indication, except in the Kent\r\nversion, which introduces the exclamation, \"Here's a prisoner I have\r\ngot!\" As the analysis shows the prisoner incident to be a real and not\r\naccidental part of the game, and the unmeaning expressions to indicate\r\nan origin earlier than modern players can understand, we can turn to\r\nother facts to see if the origin can be in any way traced.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF GAME-RHYMES.\r\n\r\n  +---+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n  |No.|      Belfast.        |      Halliwell.      |       Liphook.       |\r\n  +---+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n  | 1.|     --               |     --               |     --               |\r\n  | 2.|     --               |     --               |     --               |\r\n  | 3.|     --               |     --               |     --               |\r\n  | 4.|     --               |     --               |     --               |\r\n  | 5.|L.

The special\r\nfeature of the rhymes is that considerable difficulty occurs in the\r\nbuilding of the bridge by _ordinary_ means, but without exactly\r\nsuggesting that extraordinary means are to be adopted, a prisoner is\r\nsuddenly taken. The question is, What does this indicate?\r\n\r\nLooking to the fact of the widespread superstition of the foundation\r\nsacrifice, it would seem that we may have here a tradition of this rite.\r\nSo recently as 1872, there was a scare in Calcutta when the Hooghly\r\nBridge was being constructed. The natives then got hold of the idea that\r\nMother Ganges, indignant at being bridged, had at last consented to\r\nsubmit to the insult on condition that each pier of the structure was\r\nfounded on a layer of children's heads (Gomme's _Early Village Life_, p.\r\n29). Formerly, in Siam, when a new city gate was being erected, it was\r\ncustomary for a number of officers to lie in wait and seize the first\r\nfour or eight persons who happened to pass by, and who were then buried\r\nalive under the gate-posts to serve as guardian angels (Tylor's\r\n_Primitive Culture_, i. 97). Other instances of the same custom and\r\nbelief are given in the two works from which these examples are taken;\r\nand there is a tradition about London Bridge itself, that the stones\r\nwere bespattered with the blood of little children. Fitzstephen, in his\r\nwell-known account of London of the twelfth century, mentions that when\r\nthe Tower was built the mortar was tempered with the blood of beasts.\r\nPrisoners' heads were put on the bridge after execution down to modern\r\ntimes, and also on city gates.\r\n\r\nThese traditions about London, when compared with the actual facts of\r\ncontemporary savagery, seem to be sufficient to account for such a game\r\nas that we are now examining having originated in the foundation\r\nsacrifice. Mr. Newell, in his examination of the game, gives countenance\r\nto this theory, but he strangely connects it with other games which have\r\na tug-of-war as the finish. Now in all the English examples it is\r\nremarkable that the tug-of-war does not appear to be a part of the game;\r\nand if this evidence be conclusive, it would appear that this incident\r\ngot incorporated in America. It is this incident which Mr. Newell dwells\r\nupon in his ingenious explanation of the mythological interpretation of\r\nthe game. But apart from this, the fact that the building of bridges was\r\naccompanied by the foundation sacrifice is a more likely origin for such\r\na widespread game which is so intimately connected with a bridge.\r\n\r\nThis view is confirmed by what may be called the literary history of the\r\ngame. The verses, as belonging to a game, have only recently been\r\nrecorded, and how far they go back into tradition it is impossible to\r\nsay. Dr. Rimbault is probably right when he states \"that they have been\r\nformed by many fresh additions in a long series of years, and [the game]\r\nis perhaps almost interminable when received in all its different\r\nversions\" (_Notes and Queries_, ii. 338). In _Chronicles of London\r\nBridge_, pp. 152, 153, the author says he obtained the following note\r\nfrom a Bristol correspondent:--\"About forty years ago, one moonlight\r\nnight in the streets of Bristol, my attention was attracted by a dance\r\nand chorus of boys and girls, to which the words of this ballad gave\r\nmeasure. The breaking down of the Bridge was announced as the dancers\r\nmoved round in a circle hand in hand, and the question, 'How shall we\r\nbuild it up again?' was chanted by the leader while the rest stood\r\nstill.\" This correspondent also sent the tune the children sang, which\r\nis printed in the _Chronicles of London Bridge_. This was evidently the\r\nsame game, but it would appear that the verses have also been used as a\r\nsong, and it would be interesting to find out which is the more ancient\r\nof the two--the song or the game; and to do this it is necessary that we\r\nshould know something of the history of the song. A correspondent of\r\n_Notes and Queries_ (ii. 338) speaks of it as a \"lullaby song\" well\r\nknown in the southern part of Kent and in Lincolnshire. In the\r\n_Gentleman's Magazine_ (1823, Part II. p. 232) appeared the following\r\ninteresting note:--\r\n\r\nThe projected demolition of London Bridge recalls to my mind the\r\nintroductory lines of an old ballad which more than seventy years ago I\r\nheard plaintively warbled by a lady who was born in the reign of Charles\r\nII., and who lived till nearly the end of that of George II. I now\r\ntranscribe the lines, not as possessing any great intrinsic merit, but\r\nin the hope of learning from some intelligent correspondent the name of\r\nthe author and the story which gave rise to the ballad, for it probably\r\noriginated in some accident that happened to the old bridge. The \"Lady\r\nLea\" evidently refers to the river of that name, the favourite haunt of\r\nIsaac Walton, which, after fertilising the counties of Hertford, Essex,\r\nand Middlesex, glides into the Thames.\r\n\r\n    London Bridge is broken down,\r\n      _Dance over the Lady Lea_;\r\n    London Bridge is broken down,\r\n      _With a gay lady_ [_la-dee_].\r\n    Then we must build it up again.\r\n    What shall we build it up withal?\r\n    Build it up with iron and steel,\r\n    Iron and steel will bend and break.\r\n    Build it up with wood and stone,\r\n    Wood and stone will fall away.\r\n    Build it up with silver and gold,\r\n    Silver and gold will be stolen away.\r\n    Then we must set a man to watch,\r\n    Suppose the man should fall asleep?\r\n    Then we must put a pipe in his mouth,\r\n    Suppose the pipe should fall and break?\r\n    Then we must set a dog to watch,\r\n    Suppose the dog should run away?\r\n    Then we must chain him to a post.\r\n\r\nThe two lines in _italic_ are all regularly repeated after each\r\nline.--M. Green.\r\n\r\nAnother correspondent to this magazine, in the same volume, p. 507,\r\nobserves that the ballad concerning London Bridge \"formed, in my\r\nremembrance, part of a Christmas Carol, and commenced thus--\r\n\r\n    Dame, get up and bake your pies,\r\n    On Christmas-day in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe requisition goes on to the dame to prepare for the feast, and her\r\nanswer is--\r\n\r\n    London Bridge is fallen down,\r\n    On Christ-mas day in the morning, &c.\r\n\r\nThe inference always was, that until the bridge was rebuilt some\r\nstop would be put to the Dame's Christmas operations; but why the\r\nfalling of London Bridge should form part of a Christmas Carol at\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne I am at a loss to know.\" Some fragments were also\r\nprinted in the _Mirror_ for November 1823; and a version is also given\r\nby Ritson, _Gammer Gurton's Garland_. The _Heimskringla_ (Laing, ii.\r\n260, 261) gives an animated description of the Battle of London Bridge,\r\nwhen Ethelred, after the death of Sweyn, was assisted by Olaf in\r\nretaking and entering London, and it is curious, that the first line of\r\nthe game-rhyme appears--\r\n\r\n    London Bridge is broken down,\r\n    Gold is won and bright renown;\r\n        Shields resounding,\r\n        War-horns sounding,\r\n    Hild is shouting in the din;\r\n        Arrows singing,\r\n        Mail-coats ringing,\r\n    Odin makes our Olaf win.\r\n\r\nIf this is anything more than an accidental parallel, we come back to an\r\nhistorical episode wherein the breaking down and rebuilding of London\r\nBridge occur, and it looks as if the two streams down which this\r\ntradition has travelled, namely, first, through the game, and second,\r\nthrough the song, both refer to the same event.\r\n\r\nDr. Rimbault has, in his _Nursery Rhymes_, p. 34, reconstructed a copy\r\nof the original rhyme from the versions given by Halliwell and the\r\n_Mirror_, and gives the tune to which it was sung, which is reprinted\r\nhere. The tune from Kent is the one generally used in London versions.\r\nThe tune of a country dance called \"London Bridge\" is given in\r\nPlayford's _Dancing Master_, 1728 edition.\r\n\r\n  [4] Another informant gives the refrain, \"Grand says the little Dee.\"\r\n\r\n  [5] I have identified this with a version played at Westminster and\r\n      another taught to my children by a Hanwell girl.--A. B. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong-duck\r\n\r\nA number of children take hold of each other's hands and form a\r\nhalf-circle. The two children at one end of the line lift up their arms,\r\nso as to form an arch, and call \"Bid, bid, bid,\" the usual cry for\r\ncalling ducks. Then the children at the other end pass in order through\r\nthe arch. This process is repeated, and they go circling round the\r\nfield.--Addy's _Sheffield Glossary_.\r\n\r\nSee \"Duck Dance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLong Tag\r\n\r\nSee \"Long Terrace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLong-Tawl\r\n\r\nA game at marbles where each takes aim at the other in turn, a marble\r\nbeing paid in forfeit to whichever of the players may make a\r\nhit.--Lowsley's _Berkshire Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong Terrace\r\n\r\nEvery player chooses a partner. The couples stand immediately in front\r\nof each other, forming a long line, one remaining outside of the line on\r\nthe right-hand side, who is called the \"Clapper.\" The object of the game\r\nis for the last couple to reach the top of the line, each running on\r\ndifferent sides, and keeping to the side on which they are standing. The\r\nobject of the Clapper is to hit the one running on the right side of the\r\nline, which, if he succeeds in doing, makes him the Clapper, and the\r\nClapper takes his place. [The next _last_ couple would then presumably\r\ntry and reach the top.]--East Kirkby, Lincs. (Miss K. Maughan).\r\n\r\nA similar game to this is played at Sporle, Norfolk (Miss Matthews). It\r\nis there called \"Long Tag.\" The players stand in line behind one\r\nanother, and an odd one takes her place somewhere near the front; at a\r\ngiven signal, such as clapping of hands, the two at the back separate\r\nand try to meet again in front before the one on the watch can catch\r\nthem; they may run where they please, and when one is caught that one\r\nbecomes the one \"out.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"French Jackie.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLoup the Bullocks\r\n\r\nYoung men go out to a green meadow, and there on all-fours plant\r\nthemselves in a row about two yards distant from each other. Then he who\r\nis stationed farthest back in the \"bullock rank\" starts up and leaps\r\nover the other bullocks before him, by laying his hands on each of their\r\nbacks; and when he gets over the last one leans down himself as before,\r\nwhilst all the others, in rotation, follow his example; then he starts\r\nand leaps again.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes thought that we (the Scotch) have borrowed this\r\nrecreation from our neighbours of the \"Green Isle,\" as at their\r\nwakes they have a play much of the same kind, which they call\r\n\"Riding Father Doud.\" One of the wakers takes a stool in his hand,\r\nanother mounts that one's back, then Father Doud begins rearing and\r\nplunging, and if he unhorses his rider with a dash he does well. There\r\nis another play (at these wakes) called \"Kicking the Brogue,\" which is\r\neven ruder than \"Riding Father Doud,\" and a third one called\r\n\"Scuddieloof.\"--Mactaggart's _Gallovidian Encyclopædia_.\r\n\r\nPatterson (_Antrim and Down Glossary_) mentions a game called \"Leap the\r\nBullock,\" which he says is the same as \"Leap-frog.\"\r\n\r\nDickinson's _Cumberland Glossary Supplement_, under \"Lowp,\" says it\r\nmeans a leap or jump either running or standing. The various kinds\r\ninclude \"Catskip\"--one hitch, or hop, and one jump; \"Hitch\r\nsteppin\"--hop, step, and lowp; a hitch, a step, and a leap; \"Otho\"--two\r\nhitches, two steps, and a leap; \"Lang spang\"--two hitches, two steps, a\r\nhitch, a step, and a leap.\r\n\r\nSee \"Accroshay,\" \"Knights,\" \"Leap-frog.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLubin\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Hexham (Miss J.

Kimber).\r\n\r\n(_b_) A ring is formed and the children dance round, singing the first\r\nverse. They then stand till, sing the next verse, and, while singing,\r\nsuit the action to the word, each child turning herself rapidly round\r\nwhen singing the last line. The first verse is then repeated, and the\r\nfourth sung in the same way as the second, and so on.\r\n\r\nAnother way of playing is that the children do not dance round and\r\nround. They form a ring by joining hands, and they then all move in one\r\ndirection, about half way round, while singing the first line, \"lubin;\"\r\nthen back again in the opposite direction, while singing the second\r\nline, \"light,\" still keeping the ring form, and so on for the third and\r\nfourth lines. In each case the emphasis is laid upon the \"Here\" of each\r\nline, the movement being supposed to answer to the \"Here.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dorsetshire version (Miss M. Kimber) is played by the children\r\ntaking hands in pairs, forming a ring, and dancing round. At Eckington\r\n(S. O. Addy) the children first pretend to wash their hands, then their\r\nface, while singing the words; then comb their hair and brush their\r\nclothes; then they join hands and dance round in a ring singing the\r\nwords which follow, again suiting their actions to the words sung.\r\n\r\nIn the Scottish version a ring is formed as above. One sings, and the\r\nrest join, to the tune of \"Lillibullero,\" the first line. As soon as\r\nthis is concluded each claps his hand and wheels grotesquely, singing\r\nthe second line. They then sing the third line, suiting the action to\r\nthe word, still beating the time; then the second again, wheeling round\r\nand clapping hands. When they say \"A' feet in, and nae feet out,\" they\r\nall sit down with their feet stretched into the centre of the ring.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The other variants which follow the Halliwell version are limited\r\nto the first verse only, as the remainder of the lines are practically\r\nthe same as those given in Miss Fowler's version which is written at\r\nlength, and three or four of these apparently retain only the verse\r\ngiven. A London version, collected by myself, is nearly identical with\r\nthat of Miss Fowler, except that the third line is \"Shake your ---- a\r\nlittle, a little,\" instead of as printed. This is sung to the tune\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThe incidents in this game are the same throughout. The only difference\r\nin all the versions I have collected being in the number of the\r\ndifferent positions to be performed, most of them being for right hands,\r\nleft hands, right feet, left feet, and heads; others, probably older\r\nforms, having \"ears,\" \"yourselves,\" &c. One version, from Eckington,\r\nDerbyshire, curiously begins with \"washing hands and face,\" \"combing\r\nhair,\" &c., and then continuing with the \"Looby\" game, an apparent\r\n\"mix-up\" of \"Mulberry Bush\" and \"Looby.\" Three more versions, Sporle,\r\nCornwall, and Dorsetshire, also have different beginnings, one\r\n(Dorsetshire) having the apparently unmeaning \"I love Antimacassar.\"\r\n\r\n(_d_) The origin and meaning of this game appears somewhat doubtful. It\r\nis a choral dance, and it may owe its origin to a custom of wild antic\r\ndancing in celebration of the rites of some deity in which animal\r\npostures were assumed. The Hexham version, \"Here we come louping\r\n[leaping]\" may probably be the oldest and original form, especially if\r\nthe conjecture that this game is derived from animal rites is accepted.\r\nThe term \"looby,\" \"lubin,\" or \"luby\" does not throw much light on the\r\ngame. Addy (_Sheffield Glossary_) says, \"Looby is an old form of the\r\nmodern 'lubber,' a 'clumsy fellow,' 'a dolt.'\" That a stupid or\r\nridiculous meaning is attached to the word \"looby\" is also shown by one\r\nof the old penances for redeeming a forfeit, where a player has to lie\r\nstretched out on his back and declare,\r\n\r\n    Here I lie\r\n    The length of a looby,\r\n    The breadth of a booby,\r\n    And three parts of a jackass.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish forms of the game bear on the theory of the game being\r\ngrotesque. The fact of the players having both their arms extended at\r\nonce, one behind and one in front of them, and the more frequent\r\nspinning round, suggest this. Then, too, there is the sudden \"sit down\"\r\nposture, when \"all feet in\" is required.\r\n\r\nIn the version given by Halliwell there is more difficulty in the game,\r\nand possibly more fun. This version shows the game to be cumulative,\r\neach player having to go through an additional antic for each verse\r\nsung. This idea only needs to be carried a little further to cause the\r\nplayers to be ridiculous in their appearance. This version would be more\r\ndifficult to perform, and they would be exhausted by the process, and\r\nthe constant motion of every member of the body. Attention, too, might\r\nbe drawn to the word \"Hinkumbooby\" occurring in Chambers's version.\r\nNewell (_Games_, p. 131) mentions that some sixty years ago the game was\r\ndanced deliberately and decorously, as old fashion was, with slow\r\nrhythmical movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nLug and a Bite\r\n\r\nA boy flings an apple to some distance. All present race for it. The\r\nwinner bites as fast as he can, his compeers _lugging_ at his ears in\r\nthe meantime, who bears it as well as he can, and then he throws down\r\nthe apple, when the sport is resumed (Halliwell's _Dictionary_).\r\nBrogden's _Lincolnshire Provincial Words_ says \"Luggery-bite\" is a game\r\nboys play with fruit. One bites the fruit, and another pulls his hair\r\nuntil he throws the fruit away. The game is also played in Lancashire\r\n(_Reliquary_).\r\n\r\nSee \"Bob-Cherry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLuggie\r\n\r\nA boys' game. In this game the boys lead each other about by the\r\n\"lugs,\" _i.e._, ears; hence the name (Patterson's _Antrim and Down\r\nGlossary_). Jamieson says that the leader had to repeat a rhyme, and if\r\nhe made a mistake, he in turn became Luggie. The rhyme is not recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuking\r\n\r\nThe West Riding name for \"Knor and Spell.\" Playing begins at\r\nEaster.--Henderson's _Folk-lore_, p. 84.\r\n\r\nSee \"Nur and Spell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMag\r\n\r\nA game among boys, in which the players throw at a stone set up on\r\nedge.--Barnes (_Dorset Glossary_).\r\n\r\n\r\nMagic Whistle\r\n\r\nAll the players but three sit on chairs, or stand in two long rows\r\nfacing each other. One player sits at one end of the two rows as\r\npresident; another player is then introduced into the room by the third\r\nplayer, who leads him up between the two rows. He is then told to kneel\r\nbefore the one sitting at the end of the row of players. When he kneels\r\nany ridiculous words or formula can be said by the presiding boy, and\r\nthen he and those players who are nearest to the kneeling boy rub his\r\nback with their hands for two or three minutes. While they are doing\r\nthis the boy who led the victim up to the president fastens a string, to\r\nwhich is attached a small whistle, to the victim's coat or jacket. It\r\nmust be fastened in such a way that the whistle hangs loosely, and will\r\nnot knock against his back. The whistle is then blown by the player who\r\nattached it, and the kneeling boy is told to rise and search for the\r\nMagic Whistle. The players who are seated in the chairs must all hold\r\ntheir hands in such a way that the victim suspects it is in their\r\npossession, and proceeds to search. The whistle must be blown as often\r\nas possible, and in all directions, by those players only who can do so\r\nwithout the victim being able to either see or feel that he is carrying\r\nthe whistle with him.--London (A. B. Gomme).\r\n\r\nThis game is also called \"Knight of the Whistle.\" The boy who is to be\r\nmade a Knight of the Order of the Whistle, when led up between the two\r\nrows of players, has a cloak put round his shoulders and a cap with a\r\nfeather in it on his head. The whistle is then fastened on to the cloak.\r\nThis is described by the Rev. J. G. Wood (_Modern Playmate_, p. 189).\r\nNewell (_Games_, p. 122) gives this with a jesting formula of initiation\r\ninto knighthood. He says it was not a game of children, but belonged to\r\nan older age.\r\n\r\nSee \"Call-the-Guse.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMagical Music\r\n\r\nA pleasant drawing-room evening amusement.--Moor's _Suffolk Words_.\r\n\r\nProbably the same as \"Musical Chairs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaga, Malaga Raisins\r\n\r\nA forfeit game. The players sat in a circle. One acquainted with the\r\ntrick took a poker in his right hand, made some eccentric movements with\r\nit, passed it to his left, and gave it to his next neighbour on that\r\nside, saying, \"Malaga, Malaga raisins, very good raisins I vow,\" and\r\ntold him to do the same. Should he fail to pass it from right to left,\r\nwhen he in his turn gave it to his neighbour, without being told where\r\nthe mistake lay, he was made to pay a forfeit.--Cornwall (_Folk-lore\r\nJournal_, v. 50).\r\n\r\n\"Malaga raisins are very good raisins, but I like Valencias better,\" is\r\nthe saying used in the London version of this game, and instead of using\r\na poker a paper-knife is used, and it is played at the table. Other\r\nformulæ for games of this kind are, \"As round as the moon, has two eyes,\r\na nose, and a mouth.\" These words are said while drawing on a table with\r\nthe forefinger of the _left_ hand an imaginary face, making eyes, nose,\r\nand mouth when saying the words. The fun is caused through those players\r\nwho are unacquainted with the game drawing the imaginary face with the\r\nright hand instead of the left. Another formula is to touch each finger\r\nof the right hand with the forefinger of the left hand, saying to each\r\nfinger in succession, \"Big Tom, Little Tom, Tommy, Tom, Tom.\" The secret\r\nin this case is to say, \"Look here!\" before commencing the formula. It\r\nis the business of those players who know the game to say the words in\r\nsuch a way that the uninitiated imagine the saying of the words\r\ncorrectly with particular accents on particular words to be where the\r\ndifficulty lies. If this is well done, it diverts suspicion from the\r\nreal object of these games.--A. B. Gomme.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarbles\r\n\r\nBrand considers that marbles had their origin in bowls, and received\r\ntheir name from the substance of which the bowls were formerly made.\r\nStrutt (_Sports_, p. 384) says, \"Marbles have been used as a substitute\r\nfor bowls. I believe originally nuts, round stones, or any other small\r\nthings that could easily be bowled along were used as marbles.\" Rogers\r\nnotices \"Marbles\" in his _Pleasures of Memory_, l. 137:--\r\n\r\n    \"On yon gray stone that fronts the chancel-door,\r\n    Worn smooth by busy feet, now seen no more,\r\n    Each eve we shot the marble through the ring.\"\r\n\r\nDifferent kinds of marbles are alleys, barios, poppo, stonies.\r\nMarrididdles are marbles made by oneself by rolling and baking common\r\nclay. By boys these are treated as spurious and are always rejected. In\r\nbarter, a bary = four stonies; a common white alley = three stonies.\r\nThose with pink veins being considered best. Alleys are the most\r\nvaluable and are always reserved to be used as \"taws\" (the marble\r\nactually used by the player).

The ring sing the first, third, fifth, and alternate verses; the\r\ngirl in the middle answers with the second, fourth, and so on\r\nalternately. At the last verse the girl jumps up and breaks through the\r\nring by force; another girl takes her place in the ring, and the game\r\nbegins again. The Sussex version of \"Mary Brown\" (Chas. Wise) is played\r\nby the children standing in line and advancing and retiring towards the\r\nlying or kneeling child. The Barnes version of \"Rise, Daughter\" is also\r\nplayed in this way. The \"daughter\" lays down, and at the end of the game\r\njoins the line, and another lays down. In the Hurstmonceux version, when\r\nthe last verse is sung, the girl in the middle rises and picks a boy out\r\nof the ring; he goes in the middle with her, and they kiss. The version\r\ngiven by Halliwell is played in the same way as the Barnes version.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Halliwell (_Game Rhymes_, p. 219) gives a version of a Swedish\r\nballad or ring dance-song, entitled \"Fair Gundela,\" he considers this\r\nmay be a prototype of the English game, or that they may both be\r\nindebted to a more primitive original. The Swedish game rather gives the\r\nidea of a maiden who has sought supernatural assistance from a wise\r\nwoman, or witch, to ask after the fate of those dear to her, and the\r\nEnglish versions may also be dramatic renderings of a ballad of this\r\ncharacter. Mr. Jacobs' _More English Fairy Tales_, p. 221, considers\r\nthis game to have originated from the Tale of the \"Golden Ball.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMary mixed a Pudding up\r\n\r\n    Mary mixed a pudding up,\r\n    She mixed it very sweet,\r\n    She daren't stick a knife in\r\n    Till John came home at neet [ = night].\r\n    Taste John, taste John, don't say nay,\r\n    Perhaps to-morrow morning will be our wedding-day.\r\n\r\n    The bells shall ring and we shall sing,\r\n    And all clap hands together (round the ring).\r\n\r\n              Up the lane and down,\r\n              It's slippery as a glass,\r\n              If we go to Mrs. ----\r\n              We'll find a nice young lass.\r\n              Mary with the rosy cheeks,\r\n              Catch her if you can;\r\n              And if you cannot catch her,\r\n              We'll tell you her young man.\r\n\r\n--Hanging Heaton (Herbert Hardy).\r\n\r\nA ring is formed by the children joining hands, one child in the centre.\r\nThe first verse is sang. Two children from the ring go to the one in the\r\ncentre and _ask_ her who is her love, or as they say here [Yorks.], \"who\r\nshe goes with;\" after that the rest is sung.\r\n\r\nSee \"All the Boys.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMerrils\r\n\r\nSee \"Nine Men's Morris.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMerritot, or the Swing\r\n\r\nThis sport, which is sometimes called \"Shuggy-shew\" in the North of\r\nEngland, is described as follows by Gay:--\r\n\r\n    \"On two near elms the slackened cord I hung,\r\n    Now high, now low, my Blouzalinda swung.\"\r\n\r\nSo Rogers, in the _Pleasures of Memory_, l. 77:--\r\n\r\n    \"Soar'd in the swing, half pleas'd and half afraid,\r\n    Through sister elms that wav'd their summer shade.\"\r\n\r\nSpeght, in his _Glossary_, says, \"'Meritot,' a sport used by children by\r\nswinging themselves in bell-ropes, or such like, till they are giddy.\"\r\nIn _Mercurialis de Arte Gymnastica_, p. 216, there is an engraving of\r\nthis exercise.\r\n\r\nHalliwell quotes from a MS. _Yorkshire Glossary_, as\r\nfollows:--\"'Merrytrotter,' a rope fastened at each end to a beam or\r\nbranch of a tree, making a curve at the bottom near the floor or ground\r\nin which a child can sit, and holding fast by each side of the rope, is\r\nswung backwards and forwards.\"\r\n\r\nBaker (_Northamptonshire Glossary_) calls \"Merrytotter\" the game of\r\n\"See-saw,\" and notes that the antiquity of the game is shown by its\r\ninsertion in Pynson, \"Myry totir, child's game, oscillum.\"\r\n\r\nChaucer probably alludes to it in the following lines of the _Miller's\r\nTale_--\r\n\r\n    \"What eileth you? some gay girle (God it wote)\r\n    Hath brought you thus on the merry tote.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMerry-ma-tansa\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Biggar (Wm.

A ring is formed by all the children but one,\r\njoining hands. The one child stands in the centre. The ring of children\r\ndance round the way of the sun, first slowly and then more rapidly.\r\nFirst all the children in the ring bow to the one in the centre, and she\r\nbows back. Then they dance round singing the first and second verses,\r\nthe second verse being addressed to the child in the centre. She then\r\nwhispers a boy's name to one in the ring. This girl then sings the third\r\nverse. None in the ring are supposed to be able to answer, and the name\r\nof the chosen boy is then said aloud by the girl who asked the question.\r\nIf the name is satisfactory the ring sing the fourth verse, and the two\r\nplayers then retire and walk round a little. If the name given is not\r\nsatisfactory the ring sing the fifth verse, and another child must be\r\nchosen. When the two again stand in the centre the boys sing the sixth\r\nverse. The girls answer with the seventh. Then all the ring sing the\r\nnext verses, imitating washing clothes, wringing, ironing, baking bread,\r\nwashing hands, combing hair, &c., suiting their actions to the words of\r\nthe verses sung. The boy who was chosen then presents a ring, usually a\r\nblade of grass wrapped round her finger, to the girl. The ring then sing\r\nthe ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth verses. When all have chosen, if\r\nany lad is left without a partner, the last verse is sung.\r\n\r\nThe version recorded by Chambers is similar in action, but there are\r\nsome important differences in detail. The centre child acts as mistress\r\nof the ceremonies. The ring of children dance round her, singing the\r\nverses. At the end of the first line of the second verse they all\r\ncourtesy to her, and she returns the compliment. At the conclusion of\r\nthis verse she selects a girl from the ring and asks her her\r\nsweetheart's name, which is imparted in a whisper. Upon this the child\r\nin the centre sings the third verse, the ring dancing round as before.\r\nIf the ring approves her choice, they sing the fourth verse as in the\r\nBiggar version, and if they disapprove, the fifth. Chambers does not say\r\nwhether another child is selected, if this is the case; but it is\r\nprobable, as he says, the marriage is finally concluded upon and\r\neffected by the ring singing the verses which follow. When singing the\r\nfirst line of the eighth verse all the ring unclasps hands for a moment,\r\nand each child performs a pirouette, clapping her hands above her head.\r\n\r\n(_c_) It seems very clear from both the versions given that this is a\r\nceremonial dance, round or at a place sacred to such ceremonies as\r\nbetrothal and marriage. The version given by Chambers suggests this the\r\nmore strongly, as the child in the centre acts as mistress of the\r\nceremonies, or \"go-between,\" the person who was the negotiator between\r\nthe parents on either side in bringing a marriage about. The courtesying\r\nand bowing of those in the ring to her may show respect for this office.\r\nOn the other hand, there is the more important office of priest or\r\npriestess of \"the stones\" suggested by the action of the game, and the\r\nreverence to the centre child may be a relic of this. The fact that she\r\nasks a girl to tell her her sweetheart's name, and then announces the\r\nname of the girl's choice for approval or disapproval by the ring in\r\nboth versions, points to the time when consent by relations and friends\r\non both sides was necessary before the marriage could be agreed\r\nupon--the inquiry regarding the qualifications of the proposed wife, the\r\nrecital of her housewifely abilities, and the giving of the ring by the\r\nboy to the girl are also betrothal customs. It is to be noted that it\r\nwas a popular belief in ancient times that to wed with a rush-ring was a\r\nlegal marriage, without the intervention of a priest or the ceremonies\r\nof marriage. Poore, Bishop of Salisbury (circa 1217), prohibited the use\r\nof them--\r\n\r\n    \"With gaudy girlonds or fresh flowers dight\r\n    About her necke, or rings of rushes plight.\"\r\n\r\n--Spenser's _Queen_.\r\n\r\nAnd Shakespeare alludes to the custom in the lines--\"As fit as ten\r\ngroats for the hand of an attorney, as Tib's rush for Tom's\r\nforefinger.\"--_All's Well that Ends Well._ The rejoicing and bestowal of\r\nthe blessing by the ring of friends give an almost complete picture of\r\nearly Scotch marriage custom. A version of this game, which appeared in\r\nthe _Weekly Scotsman_ of October 16, 1893, by Edgar L. Wakeman, is\r\ninteresting, as it confirms the above idea, and adds one or two details\r\nwhich may be important, _i.e._, the \"choose your maidens one by one,\"\r\nand \"sweep the house till the bride comes home.\" This game is called the\r\n\"Gala Ship,\" and the girls, forming a ring, march round singing--\r\n\r\n    Three times round goes the gala, gala ship,\r\n      And three times round goes she;\r\n    Three times round goes the gala, gala ship,\r\n      And sinks to the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nThey repeat this thrice, courtesying low. The first to courtesy is\r\nplaced in the centre of the circle, when the others sing:--\r\n\r\n    Choose your maidens one by one,\r\n    One by one, one by one;\r\n    Choose your maidens one by one--\r\n      And down goes (all courtesy)\r\n            Merrima Tansa!\r\n\r\nShe chooses her maidens. They take her to a distance, when she is\r\nsecretly told the name of her lover. The remainder of the girls imitate\r\nsweeping, and sing several stanzas to the effect that they will \"sweep\r\nthe house till the bride comes home,\" when the bride is now placed\r\nwithin the circle, and from a score to a hundred stanzas, with marching\r\nand various imitations of what the lucky bride accomplishes or\r\nundergoes, are sung. Each one closes with \"Down goes Merrima Tansa\" and\r\nthe head-ducking; and this wonderful music-drama of childhood is not\r\nconcluded until the christening of the bride's first-born, with--\r\n\r\n    Next Sunday morn to church she must gae,\r\n    A babe on her knee, the best of 'a--\r\n      And down goes Merrima Tansa!\r\n\r\nJamieson gives the game as a ring within which one goes round with a\r\nhandkerchief, with which a stroke is given in succession to every one in\r\nthe ring; the person who strikes, or the taker, still repeating this\r\nrhyme:--\r\n\r\n    Here I gae round the jingie ring,\r\n    The jingie ring, the jingie ring,\r\n    Here I gae round the jingie ring,\r\n      And through my merry-ma-tanzie.\r\n\r\nThen the handkerchief is thrown at one in the ring, who is obliged to\r\ntake it up and go through the same process. He also mentions another\r\naccount of the game which had been sent him, which describes the game as\r\nplayed in a similar manner to the versions given by Chambers.\r\n\r\nStewart, in his _Ben Nevis and Glencoe_, p. 361, records the following\r\nrhyme:--\r\n\r\n    Here we go with merry shout,\r\n    Up and down and round about,\r\n    And dance a merry-ma-tandy,\r\n\r\nbut he does not describe the game in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilking Pails\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Monton, Lancashire (Miss Dendy); London (A.

After the last\r\nverse is sung the children try to seat themselves on the form or bank\r\nwhere the Mother has been sitting. If they can thus get home without the\r\nMother catching them they are safe. The Kentish game is played with two\r\nlines of children advancing and retiring. This was also the way in which\r\nthe London version (A. B. Gomme) was played. In the version sent by Mr.\r\nH. S. May a ring is formed by the children joining hands. One child\r\nstands in the centre--she represents the Mother. The ring of children\r\nsay the first, third, and every alternate verse. The child in the centre\r\nsays the second, fourth, and alternate verses, and the game is played as\r\nabove, except that when the Mother has said the last verse the children\r\ncall out, \"Good job, too,\" and run off, the Mother chasing them as\r\nabove. The game does not appear to be sung.\r\n\r\n(_c_) This game is somewhat of a cumulative story, having for its finish\r\nthe making angry and tormenting of a mother. All the versions point to\r\nthis. One interesting point, that of milk-pails, is, it will be seen,\r\ngradually losing ground in the rhymes. Milk-pails were pails of wood\r\nsuspended from a yoke worn on the milkmaid's shoulders, and these have\r\nbeen giving place to present-day milk-cans. Consequently we find in the\r\nrhymes only four versions in which milk-pails are used. In two versions\r\neven the sense of milking-can has been lost, and the South Shields\r\nversion, sent me by little Miss Blair, has degenerated into\r\n\"male-scales,\" a thoroughly meaningless phrase. The Cowes version (Miss\r\nSmith) has arrived at \"wash-pan.\" The \"burden\" of the Chirbury version\r\nis \"a rea, a ria, a roses,\" and the Sheffield version is also\r\nremarkable: the \"I, O, OM\" refers, probably, to something now forgotten,\r\nor it may be the \"Hi, Ho, Ham!\" familiar in many nursery rhymes. The\r\ngame seems to point to a period some time back, when milking was an\r\nimportant phase of the daily life, or perhaps to the time when it was\r\ncustomary for the maids and women of a village to go to the hilly\r\ndistricts with the cows (summer shealings) for a certain period of time.\r\nThe references to domestic life are interesting. The scarcity of beds,\r\nthe best or feather bed, and the children's bed, seeming to be all those\r\navailable. The feather bed is still a valued piece of household\r\nfurniture, and is considered somewhat of the nature of a heirloom,\r\nfeather beds often descending from mother to daughter for some\r\ngenerations. I have been told instances of this. Gregor, in _Folk-lore\r\nof East of Scotland_, p. 52, describes the Scottish box-bed. The\r\n\"truckle bed\" and \"footman's bed\" probably refers to the small bed under\r\na large one, which was only pulled out at night for use, and pushed\r\nunder during the day. Illustrations of these beds and the children's bed\r\nare given in old tales. The proximity of the pig-sty to the house is\r\nmanifest. The mention of washing-tubs calls to mind the large wooden\r\ntubs formerly always used for the family wash. Before the era of\r\nlaundresses washing-tubs must have constituted an important part of the\r\nfamily plenishing. Washing in the rivers and streams was also a thing of\r\nfrequent occurrence, hot water for the purpose of cleansing clothes not\r\nbeing considered necessary, or in many cases desirable. Chambers gives a\r\nversion of the game (_Popular Rhymes_, p. 36) and also Newell (_Games_,\r\np. 166). Another version from Buckingham is given by Thomas Baker in the\r\n_Midland Garner_, 1st ser., ii. 32, in which the mother desires the\r\ndaughter to \"milk in the washing-tub,\" and the words also appear very\r\ncuriously tacked on to the \"Three Dukes a-riding\" game from Berkshire\r\n(_Antiquary_, xxvii. 195), where they are very much out of place.\r\n\r\n\r\nMineral, Animal, and Vegetable\r\n\r\nA ball is thrown by one player to any one of the others. The thrower\r\ncalls out at the same time either \"mineral,\" \"animal,\" or \"vegetable,\"\r\nand counts from one to ten rather quickly. If the player who is touched\r\nby the ball does not name something belonging to that kingdom called\r\nbefore the number ten is reached, a forfeit has to be paid.--London (A.\r\nB. Gomme).\r\n\r\nThis is more usually called \"Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral.\" See \"Air,\r\nFire, and Water.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister's Cat\r\n\r\nThe first player begins by saying, \"The minister's cat is an ambitious\r\ncat,\" the next player \"an artful cat,\" and so on, until they have all\r\nnamed an adjective beginning with A. The next time of going round the\r\nadjectives must begin with B, the next time C, and so on, until the\r\nwhole of the alphabet has been gone through.--Forest of Dean,\r\nGloucestershire (Miss Matthews); Anderby, Lincolnshire (Miss Peacock).\r\n\r\nThis is apparently the same game as the well-known \"I love my love with\r\nan A because she is amiable.\" In this game every player has to repeat\r\nthe same sentence, but using a different adjective, which adjective must\r\nbegin with the letter A. Various sentences follow. At the next round the\r\nadjectives all begin with B; the next C, until a small story has been\r\nbuilt up. Forfeits were exacted for every failure or mistake. The\r\nformula usually was--\r\n\r\nI love my love with an A because she is (      ). I hate her with an\r\nA because she is (      ). I took her to the sign of the (      ), and\r\ntreated her to (      ). The result was (      ).\r\n\r\n\r\nMollish's Land\r\n\r\nCornish name for \"Tom Tiddler's Ground.\"--_Folk-lore Journal_, v. 57.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday, Tuesday\r\n\r\nA game played with a ball. There are seven players, who each take a name\r\nfrom one of the days of the week. One (Sunday) begins by throwing the\r\nball against a wall, calling out at the same time the name of one of the\r\ndays, who has to run and catch it before it falls. If this one fails to\r\ncatch the ball, the first player picks up the ball and tries to hit one\r\nof the six with it, who all endeavour to escape being hit. If the player\r\nsucceeds, he again throws the ball against the wall, calling out another\r\nday of the week to catch it. If a player gets hit three times, he is\r\nout. The winner is he who has either not been hit at all or the fewest\r\ntimes, or who has been able to stay in the longest. The same game is\r\nplayed with twelve children, who are named after the twelve months of\r\nthe year.--London and Barnes (A. B. Gomme); _Strand Magazine_, ii. 519\r\n(F. H. Low).\r\n\r\nThis game belongs apparently to the ball games used for purposes of\r\ndivination. Mr. Newell (_Games_, p. 181) describes a similar game to\r\nthis, in which the player whose name is called drops the ball; he must\r\npick it up as quickly as possible while the rest scatter. He then calls\r\n\"Stand!\" upon which the players halt, and he flings it at whom he\r\npleases. If he misses his aim, he must place himself in a bent position\r\nwith his hands against a wall until every player has taken a shot at\r\nhim. The idea of naming children after the days of the week occurs also\r\nin the games of \"Gipsy,\" \"Witch,\" and \"Mother, Mother, the Pot boils\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Ball,\" \"Burly Whush,\" \"Keppy Ball.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMoolie Pudding\r\n\r\nThe game of \"Deadelie;\" one has to run with the hands locked and \"taen\"\r\nthe others.--Mactaggart's _Gallovidian Encyclopædia_.\r\n\r\nSee \"Chickidy Hand,\" \"Deadelie,\" \"Hunt the Staigie,\" \"Whiddy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Sacks to the Mill\r\n\r\nA very rough game, mentioned in Dean Miles' MS., p. 180 (Halliwell's\r\n_Dictionary_). Lowsley (_Berkshire Glossary_) says this is \"a favourite\r\ngame with children at Christmas-time, when wishing for one of a romping\r\ncharacter,\" but he does not describe it further. Northall (_English Folk\r\nRhymes_, p. 354) says that in Warwickshire and Staffordshire boys\r\ntorture an unfortunate victim by throwing him on the ground and falling\r\natop of him, yelling out the formula, \"Bags to [on] the mill.\" This\r\nsummons calls up other lads, and they add their weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nMother, may I go out to Play?\r\n\r\n    I.

Please may I go out to play?\r\n           How long will you stay?\r\n           Three hours in a day.\r\n           Will you come when I call you?\r\n           No.\r\n           Will you come when I fetch you?\r\n           Yes.\r\n           Make then your curtseys and be off.\r\n\r\nThe girls then scamper off as before, and as they run about the field\r\nkeep calling out, \"I won't go home till seven o'clock, I won't go home\r\ntill seven o'clock.\" After they have been running about for some five or\r\nten minutes the Mother calls Alice (or whatever the name may be) to come\r\nhome, when the one addressed will run all the faster, crying louder than\r\nbefore, \"I won't go home till seven o'clock.\" Then the Mother commences\r\nto chase them until she catches them, and when she gets them to any\r\nparticular place in the field where the others are playing, she says--\r\n\r\n           Where have you been?\r\n           Up to grandmother's.\r\n           What have you done that you have been away so long?\r\n           I have cleaned the grate and dusted the room.\r\n           What did she give you?\r\n           A piece of bread and cheese so big as a house, and a piece of\r\n             plum cake so big as a mouse.\r\n           Where's my share?\r\n           Up in higher cupboard.\r\n           It's not there.\r\n           Up in lower cupboard.\r\n           It's not there.\r\n           Then the cat have eat it.\r\n           Where's the cat?\r\n           Up in heath.\r\n           Where's the heath?\r\n           The fire burnt it.\r\n\r\n[The rest is the same as in the last version, p. 393.]\r\n\r\n--Dorsetshire (_Folk-lore Journal_, vii. 221-222).\r\n\r\n    VI.    Mother, mother, may I (or we) go out to play?\r\n           No, child! no, child! not for the day.\r\n           Why, mother? why, mother? I won't stay long.\r\n           Make three pretty courtesies, and away begone.\r\n           One for mammy, one for daddy, one for Uncle John.\r\n           Where, child! where, child! have you been all the day?\r\n           Up to granny's.\r\n           What have you been doing there?\r\n\r\n[The answer to this is often, \"Washing doll's clothes,\" but anything may\r\nbe mentioned.]\r\n\r\n           What did she give you?\r\n\r\n[The reply is again left to the child's fancy.]\r\n\r\n           Where's my share?\r\n           The cat ate it [or, In the cat's belly].

Grandmother, grandmother grey,\r\n           May I go out to play?\r\n           No, no, no, it is a very wet day.\r\n           Grandmother, grandmother grey,\r\n           May I go out to play?\r\n           Yes, yes, yes, if you don't frighten the geese away.\r\n           Children, I call you.\r\n           I can't hear you.\r\n           Where are your manners?\r\n           In my shoe.\r\n           Who do you care for?\r\n           Not for you.\r\n\r\n--Earls Heaton, Yorks. (H. Hardy).\r\n\r\n    VIII.  Pray, mother, pray,\r\n           May I go out to play?\r\n           No, daughter, no, daughter,\r\n           Not every fine day.\r\n           Why, mother, why?\r\n           I shan't be gone long.\r\n           Make a fine curtsey\r\n           And glad git you gone.--\r\n           Wait for your sister.\r\n\r\n--Hurstmonceux, Sussex (Miss Chase).\r\n\r\n    IX.    Please, mother, please, mother, may I go out to play?\r\n           No, child, no, child, 'tis such a cold day.\r\n           Why, mother, why, mother, I won't stay long.\r\n           Make three pretty curtseys and off you run.\r\n\r\n--Northants (Rev. W. D. Sweeting).\r\n\r\n(_b_) One girl is chosen to act as \"Mother,\" the rest of the players\r\npretend to be her children, and stand in front of her, not in a line,\r\nbut in a group. One of them, very frequently all the children ask her\r\nthe first question, and the Mother answers. When she gives permission\r\nfor the children to go out they all curtsey three times, and run off and\r\npretend to play. They then return, and the rest of the dialogue is said,\r\nthe Mother asking the questions and the children replying. At the end of\r\nthe dialogue the Mother chases and catches them, one after the other,\r\npretending to beat and punish them. In the Northants and Hurstmonceux\r\ngames there appears to be no chasing. In the London version (Miss Dendy)\r\nonly two children are mentioned as playing. When the Mother is chasing\r\nthe girl she keeps asking, \"Where's my share of the silver penny?\" to\r\nwhich the girl replies, \"You may have the nut-shells.\" In the Cornish\r\nversion, when the Mother has caught one of the children, she beats her\r\nand puts her hands round the child's throat as if she were going to hang\r\nher.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Miss Courtney, in _Folk-lore Journal_, v. 55, says: \"I thought\r\nthis game was a thing of the past, but I came across some children\r\nplaying it in the streets of Penzance in 1883.\" It belongs to the\r\ncumulative group of games, and is similar in this respect to \"Milking\r\nPails,\" \"Mother, Mother, the Pot boils over,\" &c. There seems to be no\r\nother object in the game as now played except the pleasures of teasing\r\nand showing defiance to a mother's commands, and trying to escape the\r\nconsequences of disobedience by flight, in order that the mother may\r\nchase them. The idea may be that, if she is \"out of breath,\" she cannot\r\nchastise so much. Mr. Newell (_Games_, p. 172) gives versions of a\r\nsimilar game.\r\n\r\n\r\nMother Mop\r\n\r\nAll the players, except one, stand two by two in front of each other,\r\nthe inner ones forming an arch with their hands united--this is called\r\nthe \"oven.\" The odd child is \"Mother Mop.\" She busies herself with a\r\npretended mop, peel, &c., after the manner of old-fashioned bakers,\r\nmaking much ado in the valley between the rows of children. The oven\r\nsoon gets demolished, and the last child vanquished becomes \"Mother Mop\"\r\nthe next time.--Bitterne, Hants (Mrs. Byford).\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that the inner rows of children should kneel or stoop\r\ndown in order that \"Mother Mop\" should have as much trouble as possible\r\nwith her oven. The game may have lost some of its details in other\r\ndirections, as there is no apparent reason why the oven is demolished or\r\nbroken down.\r\n\r\nSee \"Jack, Jack, the Bread's a-burning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMother, Mother, the Pot Boils over\r\n\r\nA number of girls choose one of their number to represent a witch, and\r\nanother to be a mother. The Witch stands near the corner of a wall, so\r\nthat she can peep round. Then the Mother counts the children by the\r\nseven days of the week, \"Monday,\" \"Tuesday,\" &c., and appoints another\r\ngirl to act as guardian over them. She then pretends to go out washing,\r\nremoving to a short distance so as to be within ear-shot of the other\r\nchildren. As soon as the Mother has gone, the old Witch comes and says,\r\n\"Please, can I light my pipe?\" Then the children say, \"Yes, if you won't\r\nspit on t' hearth.\" She pretends to light her pipe, but spits on the\r\nhearth, and runs away with the girl called Sunday. Then the Guardian,\r\namong the confusion, pretends to rush down stairs, and, failing to find\r\nSunday, calls out, \"Mother, mother, t' pot boils over.\" The Mother\r\nreplies, \"Put your head in;\" the Guardian says, \"It's all over hairs;\"\r\nthe Mother says, \"Put the dish-clout in;\" the Guardian says, \"It's\r\ngreasy;\" the Mother says, \"Get a fork;\" the Guardian says, \"It's rusty;\"\r\nthe Mother says, \"I'll come mysen.\" She comes, and begins to count the\r\nchildren, Monday, Tuesday, up to Saturday, and missing Sunday, asks,\r\n\"Where's Sunday?\" the Guardian says, \"T' old Witch has fetched her.\" The\r\nMother answers, \"Where was you?\" \"Up stairs.\" The Mother says, \"What\r\ndoing?\" \"Making t' beds.\" \"Why didn't you come down?\" \"Because I had no\r\nshoes.\" \"Why didn't you borrow a pair?\" \"Because nobody would lend me a\r\npair.\" \"Why didn't you steal a pair?\" \"Do you want me to get hung?\" Then\r\nthe Mother runs after her, and if she can catch her thrashes her for\r\nletting Sunday go. Then the Mother pretends to go out washing again, and\r\nthe Witch fetches the other days of the week one by one, when the same\r\ndialogue is rehearsed.--Dronfield, Derbyshire (S. O. Addy).\r\n\r\nThis game was also played in London. The _dramatis personæ_ were a\r\nmother, an eldest daughter, the younger children, a witch, and a pot was\r\nrepresented by another child. The Mother names the children after the\r\ndays of the week. She tells her eldest daughter that she is going to\r\nwash, and that she expects her to take great care of her sisters, and to\r\nbe sure and not let the old witch take them. She is also to look after\r\nthe dinner, and be sure and not let the pot boil over. The Mother then\r\ndeparts, and stays at a little distance from the others. The eldest\r\ndaughter pretends to be very busy putting the house to rights, sweeps\r\nthe floor, and makes everything tidy; the younger children pretend to\r\nplay, and get in the elder sister's way. She gets angry with them, and\r\npretends to beat them. Now, the girl who personates the Witch comes and\r\nraps with her knuckles on a supposed door. The Witch stooped when\r\nwalking, and had a stick to help her along.\r\n\r\n    Come in, says the eldest sister. What do you want?\r\n    Let me light my pipe at your fire? My fire's out.\r\n    Yes! if you'll not dirty the hearth.\r\n    No, certainly; I'll be careful.\r\n\r\nWhile the eldest sister pretends to look on the shelf for something, the\r\nWitch \"dirties\" the hearth, catches hold of Monday and runs off with\r\nher; and at this moment the pot boils over. The child who is the pot\r\nmakes a \"hissing and fizzing\" noise. The daughter calls out--\r\n\r\n    Mother, mother, the pot boils over.\r\n    Take the spoon and skim it.\r\n    Can't find it.\r\n    Look on the shelf.\r\n    Can't reach it.\r\n    Take the stool.\r\n    The leg's broke.\r\n    Take the chair.\r\n    Chair's gone to be mended.\r\n    I suppose I must come myself?\r\n\r\nThe Mother here wrings her hands out of the water in the washing-tub and\r\ncomes in. She looks about and misses Monday.\r\n\r\n    Where's Monday?\r\n    Oh, please, Mother, please, I couldn't help it; but some one came to\r\n      beg a light for her pipe, and when I went for it she took Monday\r\n      off.\r\n    Why, that's the witch!\r\n\r\nThe Mother pretends to beat the eldest daughter, tells her to be more\r\ncareful another time, and to be sure and not let the pot boil over. The\r\neldest daughter cries, and promises to be more careful, and the Mother\r\ngoes again to the wash-tub.\r\n\r\nThe same thing occurs again. The Witch comes and asks--\r\n\r\n    Please, will you lend me your tinder-box? My fire's out.\r\n    Yes, certainly, if you'll bring it back directly.\r\n    You shall have it in half-an-hour.\r\n\r\nWhile the tinder-box is being looked for she runs off with Tuesday. Then\r\nthe pot boils over, and the same dialogue is repeated. The Mother comes\r\nand finds Tuesday gone. This is repeated for all the seven children in\r\nturn, different articles, gridiron, poker, &c, being borrowed each time.\r\nFinally, the eldest daughter is taken off too. There is no one now to\r\nwatch the pot, so it boils over, and makes so much noise that the Mother\r\nhears it and comes to see why it is. Finding her eldest daughter gone\r\ntoo, she goes after her children to the Witch's house. A dialogue ensues\r\nbetween the Witch and the Mother. The Mother asks--\r\n\r\n    Is this the way to the Witch's house?\r\n    There's a red bull that way!\r\n    I'll go this way.\r\n    There's a mad cow that way!\r\n    I'll go this way.\r\n    There's a mad dog that way!\r\n\r\nShe then insists on entering the house to look for her children. The\r\nWitch will not admit her, and says--\r\n\r\n    Your boots are too dirty.\r\n    I'll take my boots off.\r\n    Your stockings are too dirty.\r\n    I'll take them off.\r\n    Your feet are dirty.\r\n    I'll cut them off.\r\n    The blood will run over the threshold.\r\n    I'll wrap them up in a blanket.\r\n    The blood will run through.\r\n\r\nThis enrages the Mother, and she pushes her way into the supposed house,\r\nand looks about, and calls her children. She goes to one and says--\r\n\r\n    This tastes like my Monday.\r\n\r\nThe Witch tells her it's a barrel of pork.\r\n\r\n    No, no, this is my Monday; run away home.\r\n\r\nUpon this Monday jumps up from her crouching or kneeling posture [the\r\nchildren were generally put by the Witch behind some chairs all close\r\ntogether in one corner of the room], and runs off, followed by all the\r\nothers and their Mother. The Witch tries to catch one, and if successful\r\nthat child becomes Witch next time.--A. B. Gomme.\r\n\r\nA probable explanation of this game is that it illustrates some of the\r\npractices and customs connected with fire-worship and the worship of the\r\nhearth, and that the pot is a magical one, and would only boil over when\r\nsomething wrong had occurred and the Mother's presence was necessary.\r\nThe pot boils over directly a child is taken away, and appears to cease\r\ndoing this when the Mother comes in. It is remarkable, too, that the\r\nWitch should want to borrow a light from the fire; the objection to the\r\ngiving of fire out of the house is a well-known and widely-diffused\r\nsuperstition, the possession of a brand from the house-fire giving power\r\nto the possessor over the inmates of a house. The mention of the\r\nspitting on the hearth in the Sheffield version, and dirtying the hearth\r\nin the London version, give confirmation to the theory that the\r\ndesecration of the fire or hearth is the cause of the pot boiling over,\r\nand that the spirit of the hearth or fire is offended at the sacrilege.\r\nThe Witch, too, may be unable to get possession of a child until she has\r\nsomething belonging to the house. The journey of the Mother to the\r\nWitch's house in search of her children, the obstacles put in her path,\r\nand the mention of the spilling of blood on the threshold, are incidents\r\nwhich have great significance. Why the \"keeling\" or skimming of the\r\ncontents of the pot should be so difficult a task for the eldest\r\ndaughter that the Mother is obliged to come herself, is not so clear;\r\nthe skimming is of course to prevent the pot boiling over, and the pot\r\nmay be supposed to take the place of the Mother or Guardian of the\r\nhearth, and tell when misfortune or trouble is at hand. Or the \"boiling\r\nover\" (which, if continued, would extinguish the fire and sully the\r\nstone) may be an offence to the hearth spirit, who ceases then to\r\nprotect the inmates of the house. Fairies are said to have power over\r\nthe inmates of a house when the threshold and kitchen utensils are left\r\ndirty and uncared for. Thus on the theories accompanying the ancient\r\nhouse ritual, this extraordinary game assumes a rational aspect, and it\r\nis not too much to suggest that this explanation is the correct one.\r\n\r\nIn the game of \"Witch\" practically the same incidents occur, and nearly\r\nthe same dialogue, but the significant elements of pot-boiling and\r\nfire-protection do not appear in that game. It is not certain whether we\r\nhave two independent games, or whether \"The Witch\" is this game, the\r\nincidents of pot-boiling and the fire-protection having been lost in its\r\ntransmission to more modern notions. Although so closely allied, these\r\ngames are not one at the present day, and are therefore treated\r\nseparately. Newell (_Games_, p. 218) gives some versions of \"Witch\"\r\nwhich show a connection between that game and this. See \"Keeling the\r\nPot,\" \"Witch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMount the Tin\r\n\r\nOne child throws a tin (any kind of tin will do) to some distance, and\r\nthen walks towards it without looking round. The other children, in the\r\nmeantime, hide somewhere near. The child who threw the tin has to guard\r\nit, and at the same time try to find those who are hiding. If he sees\r\none he must call the name, and run to strike the tin with his foot. He\r\ndoes this until each one has been discovered. As they are seen they must\r\nstand out. The one who was first found has to guard the tin next time.\r\nShould one of the players be able to strike the tin while the keeper is\r\nabsent, that player calls out, \"Hide again.\" They can then all hide\r\nuntil the same keeper discovers them again.--Beddgelert (Mrs. Williams).\r\n\r\nSee \"New Squat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMouse and the Cobbler\r\n\r\nOne girl stands up and personates a mother, another pretends to be a\r\nmouse, and crouches behind a chair in a corner. The mother says to\r\nanother player--\r\n\r\n    Go and get your father's shirt.\r\n\r\nThis player goes to the chair to look for the shirt, and is tickled or\r\ntouched by the one hiding. She rushes back and calls out--\r\n\r\n    Mother, there's a mouse.\r\n    Go and get your father's coat.\r\n    There's a mouse.\r\n    Go and get your father's watch and chain.\r\n    There's a mouse.\r\n\r\nThe Mother then goes to see herself. The second time she is scratched\r\nand chased. When caught she takes the Mouse's place.--Deptford, Kent\r\n(Miss Chase).\r\n\r\nThis is evidently the same game as \"Ghost in the Garden\" and \"Ghost in\r\nthe Copper,\" in a decaying stage. There is no _raison d'etre_ for either\r\nmouse or cobbler. Probably these words are a corruption of the older\r\n\"Ghost in the Copper.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMuffin Man\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Earls Heaton (H.

Hardy).\r\n\r\n(_b_) A ring is formed by the players joining hands; one child, who is\r\nblindfolded and holds a stick, stands in the centre. The ring dance\r\nround, singing the verse. They then stand still, and the centre child\r\nholds out the stick and touches one of the ring. This player must take\r\nhold of the stick. Then the Muffin Man asks this player any questions he\r\npleases, \"Is the morn shining?\" \"Is ink white?\" &c. The child who holds\r\nthe stick answers \"Yes\" or \"No\" in a disguised voice, and the Muffin Man\r\nthen guesses who it is. He is allowed three tries. If he guesses right\r\nhe joins the ring, and the child who was touched takes his place in the\r\ncentre. In the Yorkshire versions no questions are asked; the\r\nblindfolded child goes to any one he can touch, and tries to guess his\r\nor her name. The other version, sent by Mr. Hardy, is played in the same\r\nway, and sung to the same tune. In the Congleton version (Miss Twemlow),\r\nthe blindfolded child tries to catch one of those in the ring, when the\r\nverse is sung. The lines, with an additional four from _Shropshire\r\nFolk-lore_, are given by Miss Burne among nursery rhymes and riddles.\r\n\r\nSee \"Buff with a Stick,\" \"Dinah.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMulberry Bush\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Miss Harrison.\r\n\r\n    Here we go round the mulberry bush,\r\n    The mulberry bush, the mulberry bush,\r\n    Here we go round the mulberry bush,\r\n    On a cold and frosty morning.\r\n\r\n    This is the way we wash our hands,\r\n    Wash our hands, wash our hands,\r\n    This is the way we wash our hands,\r\n    On a cold and frosty morning.\r\n\r\n    Here we go round the mulberry bush,\r\n    The mulberry bush, the mulberry bush,\r\n    Here we go round the mulberry bush,\r\n    On a cold and frosty morning.\r\n\r\n    This is the way we wash our clothes,\r\n    Wash our clothes, wash our clothes,\r\n    This is the way we wash our clothes,\r\n    On a cold and frosty morning.\r\n\r\n    Here we go round the mulberry bush,\r\n    The mulberry bush, the mulberry bush,\r\n    Here we go round the mulberry bush,\r\n    On a cold and frosty morning.\r\n\r\n    This is the way we go to school,\r\n    We go to school, we go to school,\r\n    This is the way we go to school,\r\n    On a cold and frosty morning.\r\n\r\n    Here we go round the mulberry bush,\r\n    The mulberry bush, the mulberry bush,\r\n    Here we go round the mulberry bush,\r\n    On a cold and frosty morning.\r\n\r\n--Liphook, Hants (Miss Fowler).\r\n\r\n(_b_) The children form a ring, all joining hands and dancing round\r\nwhile singing the first verse. When singing the last line they unclasp\r\ntheir hands, and each one turns rapidly round. They then sing the next\r\nverse, suiting their actions to the words they sing, again turning round\r\nsingly at the last line. This is done with every alternate verse, the\r\nfirst verse being always sung as a chorus or dance in between the\r\ndifferent action-verses. The verses may be varied or added to at\r\npleasure. The actions generally consist of washing and dressing oneself,\r\ncombing hair, washing clothes, baking bread, sweeping the floor, going\r\nto and returning from school, learning to read, cleaning boots, and\r\nlacing stays. When \"going to school,\" the children walk two by two in an\r\norderly manner; when \"coming home from school,\" jumping and running is\r\nthe style adopted; \"lacing stays,\" the hands are put behind and moved\r\nfirst one and then the other, as if lacing; \"this is the way the ladies\r\nwalk,\" holding up skirts and walking primly; \"gentlemen walk,\" walking\r\nwith long strides and sticks. The dressing process and cleaning boots\r\npreceded \"school.\"\r\n\r\n(_c_) This game is well known, and played in almost all parts of\r\nEngland. It is always played in the same way. There is so little variety\r\nin the different versions that it appears unnecessary to give more than\r\none here. In the many versions sent the only variants are: In Sporle,\r\nNorfolk, Miss Matthews says the game is sometimes called \"_Ivy_ Bush,\"\r\nor \"_Ivory_ Bush;\" and Mr. C. C. Bell, of Epworth, sends a version,\r\n\"Here we go round the Mulberry _Tree_\" In Notts it is called \"Holly\r\nBush\" (Miss Winfield). A version given in the _Folk-lore Record_, iv.\r\n174, is called the \"_Gooseberry_ Bush,\" and Halliwell (_Popular Nursery\r\nRhymes_, p. 224) records a game, the \"Bramble Bush.\" \"The bush,\" he\r\nsays, \"is often imaginative, but is sometimes represented by a child in\r\nthe centre.\" Chambers (_Popular Rhymes_, pp. 134, 135) gives the game as\r\na form of the \"Merry-ma-tanzie\"--a kind of dance. They sing while moving\r\nround to the tune of \"Nancy Dawson,\" and stopping short with courtesy at\r\nthe conclusion.\r\n\r\n    Here we go round the mulberry bush,\r\n    The mulberry bush, the mulberry bush,\r\n    Here we go round the mulberry bush,\r\n    And round the merry-ma-tanzie.\r\n\r\nDisjoining hands, they then begin, with skirts held daintily up behind,\r\nto walk singly along, singing--\r\n\r\n    This is the way the ladies walk,\r\n    The ladies walk, the ladies walk;\r\n    This is the way the ladies walk,\r\n    And round the merry-ma-tanzie.\r\n\r\nAt the last line they reunite, and again wheel round in a ring, singing\r\nas before--\r\n\r\n    Here we go round the mulberry bush, &c.\r\n\r\nAfter which, they perhaps simulate the walk of gentlemen, the chief\r\nfeature of which is length of stride, concluding with the ring dance as\r\nbefore. Probably the next movement may be--\r\n\r\n    This is the way they wash the clothes,\r\n    Wash the clothes, wash the clothes;\r\n    This is the way they wash the clothes,\r\n    And round the merry-ma-tanzie.\r\n\r\nAfter which there is, as usual, the ring dance. They then represent\r\nwashing, ironing clothes, baking bread, washing the house, and a number\r\nof other familiar proceedings.\r\n\r\nChambers quotes a fragment of this \"little ballet,\" as practised at\r\nKilbarchan, in Renfrewshire, which contains the following lines similar\r\nto those in this game:--\r\n\r\n    She synes the dishes three times a day,\r\n    Three times a day, three times a day;\r\n    She synes the dishes three times a day,\r\n    Come alang wi' the merry-ma-tanzie.\r\n\r\n    She bakes the scones three times a day,\r\n    Three times a day, three times a day;\r\n    She bakes the scones three times a day,\r\n    Come alang wi' the merry-ma-tanzie.\r\n\r\n    She ranges the stules three times a day,\r\n    Three times a day, three times a day;\r\n    She ranges the stules three times a day,\r\n    Come alang wi' the merry-ma-tanzie.\r\n\r\nThis game originated, no doubt, as a marriage dance round a sacred tree\r\nor bush. As it now exists it appears to have no other character than the\r\nperformance of duties such as those enumerated in the description. In no\r\nversion that I am acquainted with do the elements of love and marriage\r\nor kissing occur, otherwise the resemblance it bears to the Scotch\r\n\"Merry-ma-tanzie\" would suggest that it is a portion of that game. This\r\ngame possesses the centre tree, which is not preserved in\r\n\"Merry-ma-tansa.\" Trees were formerly sacred to dancing at the marriage\r\nfestival, as at Polwarth in Berwickshire, where the custom once\r\nprevailed, which is not unworthy of notice. \"In the midst of the village\r\nare two thorn trees near to each other; round these every newly-married\r\npair were expected to dance with all their friends; from hence arose the\r\nold song, 'Polwarth on the Green'\" (_New Statistical Account of\r\nScotland, Polwarth, Berwickshire_, ii. 234). Holland (_Cheshire\r\nGlossary_), under \"Kissing Bush,\" says, \"A bush of holly, ivy, or other\r\nevergreens, which is hung up in farm kitchens at Christmas, and serves\r\nthe purpose of mistletoe. The kissing bushes are usually prepared by the\r\nfarm lads on Christmas Eve, and they are often tastefully decorated with\r\napples, oranges, and bits of gay-coloured ribbon. I have occasionally\r\nseen them made upon a framework of hoop iron something in the form of a\r\ncrown, with a socket at the bottom to hold a lighted candle.\" Brand (ii.\r\n15) also describes how in Ireland men and women dance round about a bush\r\nin a large ring on the Patron Day. Newell (_Games_, p. 86), gives this\r\ngame, and also mentions one in which \"barberry bush\" is named. The tune\r\nin all versions is the same. See \"Merry ma-tansa,\" \"Nettles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMunshets or Munshits\r\n\r\nIs played by two boys as follows:--One of the boys remains \"at home,\"\r\nand the other goes out to a prescribed distance. The boy who remains \"at\r\nhome\" makes a small hole in the ground, and holds in his hand a stick\r\nabout three feet long to strike with. The boy who is out at field throws\r\na stick in the direction of this hole, at which the other strikes. If he\r\nhits it, he has to run to a prescribed mark and back to the hole without\r\nbeing caught or touched with the smaller stick by his playfellow. If he\r\nis caught, he is \"out,\" and has to go to field. And if the boy at field\r\ncan throw his stick so near to the hole as to be within the length or\r\nmeasure of that stick, the boy at home has to go out to field. A number\r\nof boys often play together; for any even number can play. I am told\r\nthat the game was common fifty years ago. In principle it resembles\r\ncricket, and looks like the rude beginning of the game.--Addy's\r\n_Sheffield Glossary_.\r\n\r\nSee \"Cat,\" \"Cudgel,\" \"Kit-cat,\" \"Tip-cat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMusical Chairs\r\n\r\nA line of chairs is placed in a row down a room (one chair less than the\r\nnumber of children who are playing) in such a way that every alternate\r\nchair only is available on either side for the players to seat\r\nthemselves. The children walk or dance round the chairs, keeping quite\r\nclose to them. The piano or other musical instrument is played while\r\nthey are dancing round. The music is continued for any length of time\r\nthe player pleases, the children running round the chairs as long as the\r\nmusic goes on. The player stops the music suddenly, when all the\r\nchildren endeavour to take seats. One will be unable to find a seat, and\r\nthis player remains \"out.\" A chair is then taken away, and the music and\r\ndancing round begins again. There should always be one chair less than\r\nthe number of players.--A. B. Gomme.\r\n\r\nIn Ellesmere, Miss Burne says, \"Snap-tongs,\" called in other circles\r\n\"Magic Music\" or \"Musical Chairs,\" is thus played. Five players take\r\npart; four chairs are set in the middle, and one of the players, who\r\nholds a pair of tongs, desires the others to dance round them till the\r\nclock strikes a certain hour, which is done by snapping the tongs\r\ntogether so many times. While they dance, a chair is taken away, and the\r\nplayer who cannot find a seat has to become the \"snap-tongs\" next\r\ntime.--_Shropshire Folk-lore_, p. 525.\r\n\r\n\r\nNacks\r\n\r\nA game in which pegs of wood play a similar part to the well-known\r\nobject \"Aunt Sally.\"--Robinson's _Mid Yorkshire Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNamers and Guessers\r\n\r\nAny number of players can play this game. Two are chosen, the one to be\r\nNamer, and the other Guesser or Witch. The rest of the players range\r\nthemselves in a row. The Guesser retires out of sight or to a distance.\r\nThe Namer then gives each player a secret name. When names have been\r\ngiven to all the players, the Namer calls on the Guesser to come, by\r\nsaying--\r\n\r\n    Witchie, witchie, yer bannocks are burnin',\r\n    An' ready for turnin'.\r\n\r\nWhereupon he approaches, and the Namer says--\r\n\r\n    Come, chois me out, come, chois me in, to ----\r\n\r\n(naming one by the assumed name). The players all shout, \"Tack me, tack\r\nme,\" repeatedly. The Witch points to one. If the guess is correct the\r\nplayer goes to the Witch's side, but if it is incorrect he goes to the\r\nNamer's side. This goes on till all the players are ranged on the one\r\nside or the other. The two parties then come to a tug, with the Namer\r\nand Guesser as leaders. The gaining party then ranges itself in two\r\nlines with a space between the lines, each boy holding in his hand his\r\ncap or his handkerchief tightly plaited. The boys of the conquered side\r\nhave then to run between the two lines, and are pelted by the victors.\r\nThis is called, \"Throuw the Muir o' Hecklepin.\"--Keith (Rev. W. Gregor).\r\n\r\nThis game is practically the same as \"Fool, Fool, come to School,\" but\r\nthe secret naming may indicate that this belongs to an earlier form.\r\n\r\nSee \"Fool, Fool,\" \"Hecklebirnie.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNeighbour\r\n\r\nThere is a game called \"Neighbour, I torment thee,\" played in\r\nStaffordshire, \"with two hands, and two feet, and a bob, and a nod as I\r\ndo.\"--Halliwell's _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeiveie-nick-nack\r\n\r\nA fireside game. A person puts a little trifle, such as a button, into\r\none hand, shuts it close, the other hand is also shut; then they are\r\nboth whirled round and round one another as fast as they can, before the\r\nnose of the one who intends to guess what hand the prize is in; and if\r\nthe guesser be so fortunate as to guess the hand the prize is in, it\r\nbecomes his property; the whirling of the fists is attended with the\r\nfollowing rhyme--\r\n\r\n    Neiveie, neiveie, nick nack,\r\n    What ane will ye tak,\r\n    The right or the wrang?\r\n    Guess or it be lang,\r\n    Plot awa' and plan,\r\n    I'll cheat ye gif I can.\r\n\r\n--Mactaggart's _Gallovidian Encyclopædia_.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. W. Gregor says at Keith this game is played at Christmas, and\r\nby two. The stakes are commonly pins. One player conceals a pin, or more\r\nif agreed on, in one of his (her) hands. He then closes both hands and\r\ntwirls them over each other, in front of the other player, and repeats\r\nthe words--\r\n\r\n    Nivvie, nivvie-neek-nack,\r\n    Filk (which) (or filk han') 'ill ye tack?\r\n    Tack the richt, tack the left,\r\n    An' a'll deceave ye gehn (if) I can.\r\n\r\nThe other player chooses. If he chooses the hand having the stake, he\r\ngains it. If he does not, he forfeits the stake.

The boy says--\r\n\r\n    Neevy, neevy-nack,\r\n    Whether hand will ta tack,\r\n    T'topmer or t'lowmer?\r\n\r\nMr. W. H. Patterson (_Antrim and Down Glossary_) gives the rhyme as--\r\n\r\n    Nievy, navy, nick nack,\r\n    Which han' will ye tak',\r\n    The right or the wrang?\r\n    I'll beguile ye if I can.\r\n\r\nChambers (_Popular Rhymes_, p. 117) gives the rhyme the same as that\r\ngiven by Mr. Patterson. In _Notes and Queries_, 6th Series, vii. 235, a\r\nNorth Yorkshire version is given as--\r\n\r\n    Nievie, nievie, nack,\r\n    Whether hand wilta tak,\r\n    Under or aboon,\r\n    For a singal half-crown?\r\n    Nievie, nievie, nick, nack,\r\n    Whilk han' will thou tak?\r\n    Tak the richt or tak the wrang,\r\n    I'll beguile thee if I can.\r\n\r\nJamieson (_Supp., sub voce_) adds: \"The first part of the word seems to\r\nbe from neive, the fist being employed in the game.\" A writer in _Notes\r\nand Queries_, iii. 180, says: \"The neive, though employed in the game,\r\nis not the object addressed. It is held out to him who is to guess--the\r\nconjuror--_and it is he who is addressed_, and under a conjuring name.\r\nIn short (to hazard a wide conjecture, it may be) he is invoked in the\r\nperson of Nic Neville (Neivi Nic), a sorcerer in the days of James VI.,\r\nwho was burnt at St. Andrews in 1569. If I am right, a curious testimony\r\nis furnished to his quondam popularity among the common people.\" It will\r\nbe remembered that this game is mentioned by Scott in _St. Ronan's\r\nWell_--\"Na, na, said the boy, he is a queer old cull. . . . He gave me\r\nhalf-a-crown yince, and forbade me to play it awa' at pitch and toss.\"\r\n\"And you disobeyed him, of course?\" \"Na, I didna disobey him--I played\r\nit awa' at 'Nievie, nievie, nick-nack.'\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Handy-dandy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNettles\r\n\r\n    Nettles grow in an angry bush,\r\n    An angry bush, an angry bush;\r\n    Nettles grow in an angry bush,\r\n        With my high, ho, ham!\r\n\r\n    This is the way the lady goes,\r\n    The lady goes, the lady goes;\r\n    This is the way the lady goes,\r\n        With my hi, ho, ham!\r\n\r\n    Nettles grow in an angry bush, &c.\r\n\r\n    This is the way the gentleman goes, &c.\r\n\r\n    Nettles grow in an angry bush, &c.\r\n\r\n    This is the way the tailor goes.\r\n\r\n--Halliwell's _Nursery Rhymes_, 227.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The children dance round, singing the first three lines, turning\r\nround and clapping hands for the fourth line. They curtsey while saying,\r\n\"This is the way the lady goes,\" and again turn round and clap hands for\r\nthe last line. The same process is followed in every verse, only varying\r\nwhat they act--thus, in the third verse, they bow for the gentleman--and\r\nso the amusement is protracted _ad libitum_, with shoemaking, washing\r\nclothes, ironing, churning, milking, making up butter, &c, &c.\r\n\r\n(_c_) This game is practically the same as the \"Mulberry Bush.\" The\r\naction is carried on in the same way, except that the children clap\r\ntheir hands at the fourth line, instead of each turning themselves\r\nround, as in \"Mulberry Bush.\" The \"High, ho, ham!\" termination may be\r\nthe same as the \"I, O, OM\" of Mr. Addy's version of \"Milking Pails.\"\r\n\r\nSee \"Mulberry Bush,\" \"When I was a Young Girl.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Squat\r\n\r\nA ring is made by marking the ground, and a tin placed in the middle of\r\nit. One boy acts as keeper of the tin, the other players also stand\r\noutside the ring. One of these kicks the tin out of the ring, the others\r\nthen all run to hide or squat out of sight. The keeper has to replace\r\nthe tin before looking for the boys. If, after that, he can spy a boy,\r\nthat boy must come out and stand by the ring. When another boy is spied,\r\nhe endeavours to reach the ring before the keeper does so, and kick out\r\nthe tin. If he is successful, any one of the boys who is standing by,\r\nhaving been previously spied, is released from the keeper, and again\r\nhides. The object of the keeper is to successfully spy all the boys.\r\nWhen this is accomplished the last boy becomes the keeper.--Earls\r\nHeaton, Yorks. (Herbert Hardy).\r\n\r\nSee \"Mount the Tin.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNine Holes\r\n\r\nNine round holes are made in the ground, and a ball aimed at them from a\r\ncertain distance; or the holes are made in a board with a number over\r\neach, through one of which the ball has to pass.--Forby's _Vocabulary_.\r\n\r\n\"A rural game,\" says Nares, \"played by making nine holes in the ground,\r\nin the angles and sides of a square, and placing stones and other things\r\nupon, according to certain rules.\" Moor (_Suffolk Words and Phrases_)\r\nsays: \"This is, I believe, accurate as far as it goes, of our Suffolk\r\ngame. A hole in the middle is necessary.\" In Norfolk, Holloway (_Dict.\r\nProv._) says that nine round holes are made in the ground, and a ball\r\naimed at them from a certain distance. A second game is played with a\r\nboard having nine holes, through one of which the ball must pass. Nares\r\nquotes several authors to show the antiquity of the game. He shows that\r\nthe \"Nine Men's Morris\" of our ancestors was but another name for \"Nine\r\nHoles.\" Nine, a favourite and mysterious number everywhere, prevails in\r\ngames.\r\n\r\nStrutt (_Sports_, p. 384) also describes the game as played in two\r\nways--a game with bowling marbles at a wooden bridge; and another game,\r\nalso with marbles, in which four, five, or six holes, and sometimes\r\nmore, are made in the ground at a distance from each other, and the\r\nbusiness of every one of the players is to bowl a marble, by a regular\r\nsuccession, into all the holes, and he who completes in the fewest bowls\r\nobtains the victory. In Northamptonshire a game called \"Nine Holes,\" or\r\n\"Trunks,\" is played with a long piece of wood or bridge with nine arches\r\ncut in it, each arch being marked with a figure over it, from one to\r\nnine, in the following rotation--VII., V., III., I., IX., II., IIII.,\r\nVI., VIII. Each player has two flattened balls which he aims to bowl\r\nedgeways under the arches; he scores the number marked over the arch he\r\nbowls through, and he that attains to forty-five first wins the game\r\n(Baker's _Northamptonshire Glossary_). In _Arch. Journ._, xlix. 320, in\r\na paper by Mr. J. T. Micklethwaite, this game is described, and diagrams\r\nof the game given which had been found by him cut in a stone bench in\r\nthe church of Ardeley, Hertfordshire, and elsewhere. He has also seen\r\nthe game played in London. It is evidently the same game as described by\r\nNares and Moor above.\r\n\r\nSee \"Bridgeboard,\" \"Nine Men's Morris.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNine Men's Morris\r\n\r\nIn the East Riding this game is played thus: A flat piece of wood about\r\neight inches square is taken, and on it twenty-four holes are bored by\r\nmeans of a hot skewer or piece of hot iron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nEach of the two players has nine wooden pegs, which are either\r\ncoloured or shaped differently, and the object of each player is to\r\nget three of his own pegs in a straight line (fig. 1). It is called\r\n\"Merrils.\"--Sheffield (S. O. Addy).\r\n\r\nCotgrave's _Dictionarie_, 1632, says: \"_Merelles_, le jeu de merelles,\r\nthe boyish game called merrils, or fiue-pennie morris. Played here most\r\ncommonly with stones, but in France with pawns or men made of purpose,\r\nand termed merelles.\" Strutt (_Sports_, p. 317) says: \"This was why the\r\ngame received this name. It was formerly called 'Nine Men's Morris' and\r\n'Five-penny Morris,' and is a game of some antiquity. It was certainly\r\nmuch used by the shepherds formerly, and continues to be used by them\r\nand other rustics to the present hour.\" An illustration of the form of\r\nthe merelle table and the lines upon it, as it appeared in the\r\nfourteenth century, is given by him, and he observes that the lines have\r\nnot been varied. The black spots at every angle and intersection of the\r\nlines are the places for the men to be laid upon. The men are different\r\nin form and colour for distinction's sake, and from the moving these men\r\nbackwards and forwards, as though they were dancing a morris, I suppose\r\nthe pastime received the name of \"Nine Men's Morris,\" but why it should\r\nhave been called \"Five-penny Morris\" I do not know. The manner of\r\nplaying is briefly thus:--Two persons, having each of them nine pieces\r\nor men, lay them down alternately, one by one, upon the spots, and the\r\nbusiness of either party is to prevent his antagonist from placing three\r\nof his pieces so as to form a row of three without the intervention of\r\nan opponent piece. If a row be formed, he that made it is at liberty to\r\ntake up one of his competitor's pieces from any part he thinks most to\r\nhis own advantage, excepting he has made a row, which must not be\r\ntouched, if he have another piece upon the board that is not a component\r\npart of that row. When all the pieces are laid down they are played\r\nbackwards and forwards in any direction that the lines run, but can only\r\nmove from one spot to another at one time. He that takes off all his\r\nantagonist's pieces is the conqueror. The rustics, when they have not\r\nmaterials at hand to make a table, cut the lines in the same form upon\r\nthe ground and make a small hole for every dot. They then collect stones\r\nof different forms or colours for the pieces, and play the game by\r\ndepositing them in the holes in the same manner that they are set over\r\nthe dots on the table. Hence Shakespeare, describing the effects of a\r\nwet and stormy season, says--\r\n\r\n    \"The folds stand empty in the drowned field,\r\n    And crows are fatted with the murrain flock--\r\n    The Nine Men's Morris is filled up with mud.\"\r\n\r\n--_Midsummer Nights Dream_, act ii. sc. 2.\r\n\r\nMiss Baker (_Northamptonshire Glossary_), in describing \"Merell\" or\r\n\"Morris,\" says:--\"On the inclosing of open fields this game was\r\ntransferred to a board, and continues a fireside recreation of the\r\nagricultural labourer. It is often called by the name of 'Mill' or\r\n'Shepherd's Mill.'\" She says the mode of playing now observed is this.\r\nEach of the players has nine pieces, or men, differing in colour, or\r\nmaterial, from his adversary, for distinction's sake; which they lay\r\ndown on the spots alternately, one by one, each endeavouring to prevent\r\nhis opponent from placing three of his pieces in a line, as whichever\r\ndoes so is entitled to take off any one of his antagonist's men where he\r\npleases, without breaking a row of three, which must not be done whilst\r\nthere is another man on the board. After all the pieces are placed on\r\nthe board, they are moved alternately backwards and forwards along the\r\nlines; and as often as either of the players succeeds in accomplishing a\r\nrow of three, he claims one of his antagonist's men, which is placed in\r\nthe pound (the centre), and he who takes the most pieces wins the game.\r\nIt is played on a board whereon are marked three squares, one being\r\ndenominated the pound. It is sometimes played with pegs, bits of paper,\r\nor wood, or stone. It is called \"Peg Morris\" by Clare, the\r\nNorthamptonshire poet.\r\n\r\nThe ancient game of \"Nine Men's Morris\" is yet played by the boys of\r\nDorset. The boys of a cottage, near Dorchester, had a while ago carved a\r\n\"Marrel\" pound on a block of stone by the house. Some years ago a\r\nclergyman of one of the upper counties wrote that in the pulling down of\r\na wall in his church, built in the thirteenth century, the workmen came\r\nto a block of stone with a \"Marrel's\" pound cut on it. \"Merrels\" the\r\ngame was called by a mason.--Barnes' _Additional Glossary; Folk-lore\r\nJournal_, vii. 233.\r\n\r\n\"'Nine Men's Morris,' in Gloucestershire called 'Ninepenny Morris,'\r\nwas,\" says a correspondent in the _Midland Garner_, \"largely practised\r\nby boys and even older people over thirty years ago, but is now, as far\r\nas I know, entirely disused. Two persons play. Each must have twelve\r\npegs, or twelve pieces of anything which can be distinguished. The\r\nMorris was usually marked on a board or stone with chalk, and consists\r\nof twenty-four points. The pegs are put down one at a time alternately\r\nupon any point upon the Morris, and the first person who makes a\r\nconsecutive row of three impounds one of his opponent's pegs. The pegs\r\nmust only be moved on the lines. The game is continued until one or\r\nother of the players has only two pegs left, when the game is won\" (1st\r\nser., i. 20). Another correspondent in the same journal (ii. 2) says,\r\n\"The game was very generally played in the midland counties under the\r\nname of 'Merrilpeg' or 'Merelles.' The twelve pieces I have never seen\r\nused, though I have often played with nine. We generally used marbles or\r\ndraught pieces, and not pegs.\"\r\n\r\nThe following are the accounts of this game given by the commentators on\r\nShakespeare:--\r\n\r\n\"In that part of Warwickshire where Shakespeare was educated, and the\r\nneighbouring parts of Northamptonshire, the shepherds and other boys dig\r\nup the turf with their knives to represent a sort of imperfect\r\nchess-board. It consists of a square, sometimes only a foot diameter,\r\nsometimes three or four yards. Within this is another square, every side\r\nof which is parallel to the external square; and these squares are\r\njoined by lines drawn from each corner of both squares, and the middle\r\nof each line. One party, or player, has wooden pegs, the other stones,\r\nwhich they move in such a manner as to take up each other's men, as they\r\nare called, and the area of the inner square is called the pound, in\r\nwhich the men taken up are impounded. These figures are by the country\r\npeople called _nine men's morris_, or _merrils_; and are so called\r\nbecause each party has nine men. These figures are always cut upon the\r\ngreen turf, or leys as they are called, or upon the grass at the end of\r\nploughed lands, and in rainy seasons never fail to be choked up with\r\nmud\" (Farmer). \"_Nine men's morris_ is a game still played by the\r\nshepherds, cow-keepers, &c., in the midland counties, as follows:--A\r\nfigure (of squares one within another) is made on the ground by cutting\r\nout the turf; and two persons take each nine stones, which they place by\r\nturns in the angles, and afterwards move alternately, as at chess or\r\ndraughts. He who can play three in a straight line may then take off any\r\none of his adversary's, where he pleases, till one, having lost all his\r\nmen, loses the game\" (Alchorne).\r\n\r\nThe following is the account of this game given by Mr. Douce in the\r\n_Illustrations of Shakespeare and of Ancient Manners_, 1807, i.\r\n184:--\"This game was sometimes called the _nine mens merrils_ from\r\n_merelles_, or _mereaux_, an ancient French word for the jettons, or\r\ncounters, with which it was played. The other term, _morris_, is\r\nprobably a corruption suggested by the sort of dance which, in the\r\nprogress of the game, the counters performed. In the French _merelles_\r\neach party had three counters only, which were to be placed in a line in\r\norder to win the game. It appears to have been the _tremerel_ mentioned\r\nin an old fabliau. See _Le Grand_, _Fabliaux et Contes_, ii. 208. Dr.\r\nHyde thinks the morris, or merrils, was known during the time that the\r\nNormans continued in possession of England, and that the name was\r\nafterwards corrupted into _three men's morals_, or _nine men's morals_.\r\nIf this be true, the conversion of _morrals_ into _morris_, a term so\r\nvery familiar to the country people, was extremely natural. The Doctor\r\nadds, that it was likewise called _nine-penny_ or _nine-pin miracle_,\r\n_three-penny morris_, _five-penny morris_, _nine-penny morris_, or\r\n_three-pin_, _five-pin_, and _nine-pin morris_, all corruptions of\r\n_three-pin, &c, merels_\" (Hyde's _Hist. Nederluddi_, p. 202). Nares says\r\nthe simpler plan here represented (fig. 2), which he had also seen cut\r\non small boards, is more like the game than the one referred to in the\r\nvariorem notes of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nForby has, \"_Morris_, an ancient game, in very common modern use. In\r\nShakespeare it is called 'nine men's _morris_,' from its being played\r\nwith nine men, as they were then, and still are called. We call it\r\nsimply _morris_. Probably it took the name from a fancied resemblance to\r\na dance, in the motions of the men. Dr. Johnson professes that he knew\r\nno more of it than that it was some rustic game. Another commentator\r\nspeaks of it as common among shepherds' boys in some parts of\r\nWarwickshire. It cannot well be more common there than here, and it is\r\nnot particularly rustic. Shepherds' boys and other clowns play it on the\r\ngreen turf, or on the bare ground; cutting or scratching the lines, on\r\nthe one or the other. In either case it is soon filled up with mud in\r\nwet weather. In towns, porters and other labourers play it, at their\r\nleisure hours, on the flat pavement, tracing the figure with chalk. It\r\nis also a domestic game; and the figure is to be found on the back of\r\nsome draught-boards. But to compare _morris_ with that game, or with\r\nchess, seems absurd; as it has a very distant resemblance, if any at\r\nall, to either, in the lines, or in the rules of playing. On the ground,\r\nthe men are pebbles, broken tiles, shells, or potsherds; on a table, the\r\nsame as are used at draughts or backgammon. In Nares it is said to be\r\nthe same as nine-holes. With us it is certainly different.\" Cope\r\n(_Hampshire Glossary_) says that \"Nine Men's Morrice\" is a game played\r\nwith counters. He does not describe it further. Atkinson (_Glossary of\r\nCleveland Dialect_) says under \"Merls,\" the game of \"Merelles,\" or \"Nine\r\nMen's Morris.\" Toone (_Etymological Dictionary_) describes it as a game\r\nplayed on the green sward, holes being cut thereon, into which stones\r\nwere placed by the players. Stead's _Holderness Glossary_ calls it\r\n\"Merrils,\" and describes it as a game played on a square board with\r\neighteen pegs, nine on each side, called in many parts \"Nine Men's\r\nMorrice.\" See also _Sussex Arch. Collections_, xxv. 234, and a paper by\r\nMr. J. T. Micklethwaite (_Arch. Journ._, xlix. 322), where diagrams of\r\nthis game are given which have been found cut in several places on the\r\nbenches of the cloisters at Gloucester, Salisbury, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSee \"Noughts and Crosses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNip-srat-and-bite\r\n\r\nA children's game, in which nuts, pence, gingerbread, &c, are\r\nsquandered.--Addy's _Sheffield Glossary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNitch, Notch, No-Notch\r\n\r\nChildren cut a number of slices from an apple, extending from the eye to\r\nthe tail, broader on the outside than on the inner, which reaches nearly\r\nto the core; one piece has a part cut out, making a notch--this is\r\ncalled \"Notch;\" another is not cut at all--this is called \"No-Notch;\"\r\nwhile a third has an incision made on it, but not cut out--this is\r\ncalled \"Nitch.\" The pieces when thus marked are replaced, and the game\r\nconsists in one child holding the apple, and pointing to one of the\r\npieces, asking another child which he will have, \"Nitch, Notch, or\r\nNo-Notch;\" if he guesses right, he has it and eats it; if wrong, the\r\nother eats it.--Sussex (Holloway's _Dict. of Provincialisms_).\r\n\r\n\r\nNot\r\n\r\nA game where the parties, ranged on opposite sides, with each a bat in\r\ntheir hands, endeavour to strike a ball to opposite goals. The game is\r\ncalled \"Not,\" from the ball being made of a knotty piece of\r\nwood.--Gloucestershire (Holloway's _Dict. of Provincialisms_).\r\n\r\nSee \"Hawkey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNoughts and Crosses\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis game is played on slates by school-children. The accompanying\r\ndiagram is drawn on the slate, and a certain figure (generally twenty)\r\nis agreed upon as \"game.\" There are two players, one takes noughts [o],\r\nthe other crosses [x]. The three places drawn on the slate above the\r\ndiagram are for the players each to put down marks or numbers for the\r\ngames they win, the centre place being for \"Old Nick,\" or \"Old Tom.\" The\r\nobject of the game is for each player to occupy three contiguous places\r\nin a row or line with either noughts or crosses, and to prevent his\r\nopponent from doing so. The diagram is of course empty when play\r\nbegins. One player commences by putting his mark into either of the\r\nvacant places he prefers, the other player then places his in another,\r\nwherever he thinks he has the best opportunity to prevent his opponent\r\ngetting a \"three,\" and at the same time to get a three himself; then the\r\nfirst player plays again, and so on alternately until all the squares\r\nare occupied, or until one of the players has a \"three\" in line. If\r\nneither player gets a \"three,\" the game is won by \"Old Nick,\" and one is\r\nscored to his name. In the diagram the result of the game is shown when\r\nwon by \"Old Nick.\" Whichever player first wins a game adds \"Old Nick's\"\r\nscore to his own. In some games \"Old Nick\" keeps all he wins for\r\nhimself, and then most frequently wins the game.--London (A. B. Gomme).\r\n\r\nSee \"Corsicrown,\" \"Kit-Cat-Cannio,\" \"Nine Men's Morris.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNur and Spel\r\n\r\nA boys' game in Lincolnshire, somewhat similar to \"Trap Ball.\" It is\r\nplayed with a \"kibble,\" a \"nur,\" and a \"spell.\" By striking the end of\r\nthe spell with the kibble, the nur, of course, rises into the air, and\r\nthe art of the game is to strike it with the kibble before it reaches\r\nthe ground. He who drives it the greatest distance wins the\r\ngame.--Halliwell's _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\nStrutt (_Sports and Pastimes_, p. 109) describes this game as\r\n\"Northern-spell,\" played with a trap, and the ball is stricken with a\r\nbat or bludgeon. The contest between the players is simply who shall\r\nstrike the ball to the greatest distance in a given number of strokes.\r\nThe length of each stroke is measured before the ball is returned, by\r\nmeans of a cord made fast at one end near the trap, the other being\r\nstretched into the field by a person stationed there for that purpose,\r\nwho adjusts it to the ball wherever it may lie.\r\n\r\nIn a work entitled the _Costumes of Yorkshire_ this game is described\r\nand represented as \"Nor and Spell.\" The little wooden ball used in this\r\ngame is in Yorkshire called the \"Nor,\" and the receptacle in which it is\r\nplaced the \"Spell.\" Peacock (_Manley and Corringham Glossary_) gives\r\n\"knur,\" (1) a hard wooden ball, (2) the head. Addy (_Sheffield\r\nGlossary_) says \"knur\" is a small round ball, less than a billiard ball.\r\nIt is put into a cup fixed on a spring which, being touched, causes the\r\nball to rise into the air, when it is struck by a trip-stick, a slender\r\nstick made broad and flat at one end. The \"knur\" is struck by the broad\r\npart. The game is played on Shrove Tuesday. Brogden (_Provincial Words\r\nof Lincolnshire_) gives it under \"Bandy.\" It is called \"Knur, Spell, and\r\nKibble\" in S.-W. Lincolnshire.--Cole's _Glossary_.\r\n\r\nThe following letter relating to this game is extracted from the\r\n_Worcestershire Chronicle_, September 1847, in Ellis's edition of\r\nBrand:--\"Before the commons were taken in, the children of the poor had\r\nample space wherein to recreate themselves at cricket, _nurr_, or any\r\nother diversion; but now they are driven from every green spot, and in\r\nBromsgrove here, the nailor boys, from the force of circumstances, have\r\ntaken possession of the turnpike road to play the before-mentioned\r\ngames, to the serious inconvenience of the passengers, one of whom, a\r\nwoman, was yesterday knocked down by a _nurr_ which struck her in the\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\nBrockett says of this game, as played in Durham: It is called \"Spell and\r\nOre,\" Teut. \"spel,\" a play or sport; and Germ. \"knorr,\" a knot of wood\r\nor ore. The recreation is also called \"Buckstick, Spell, and Ore,\" the\r\nbuckstick with which the ore is struck being broad at one end like the\r\nbutt of a gun (_North Country Words_). In Yorkshire it is \"Spell and\r\nNurr,\" or \"Knur,\" the ore or wooden ball having been, perhaps,\r\noriginally the knurl or knot of a tree. The _Whitby Glossary_ also gives\r\nthis as \"Spell and Knor,\" and says it is known in the South as \"Dab and\r\nStick.\" The author adds, \"May not 'tribbit,' or 'trevit,' be a\r\ncorruption of 'three feet,' the required length of the stick for pliable\r\nadaptation?\"\r\n\r\nRobinson (_Mid-Yorkshire Glossary_), under \"Spell and Nur,\" says: \"A\r\ngame played with a wooden ball and a stick fitted at the striking end\r\nwith a club-shaped piece of wood. The 'spell' made to receive and spring\r\nthe ball for the blow at a touch, is a simple contrivance of wood an\r\ninch or so in breadth and a few inches long. . . . The players, who\r\nusually go in and out by turns each time, after a preliminary series of\r\ntippings of the spell with the stick in one hand, and catches of the\r\nball with the other, in the process of calculating the momentum\r\nnecessary for reach of hand, are also allowed two trial 'rises' in a\r\nstriking attitude, and distance is reckoned by scores of yards. The long\r\npliable stick, with a loose club end, used in the game, is called the\r\n'tribit' or 'trivit' stick. . . . The trevit is, in fact, the trap\r\nitself, and the trevit-stick the stick with which the trap is struck.\"\r\nThe tribbit-stick is elsewhere called \"primstick,\" \"gelstick,\"\r\n\"buckstick,\" \"trippit,\" and \"trevit.\" Atkinson says that \"spell\" is\r\nO.N., \"spill\" meaning a play or game, and the probability is that the\r\ngame is a lineal descendant from the Ball-play of the Old Danes, or\r\nNorthmen, and Icelanders. \"Spell and knor\" is a corruption of \"spell a'\r\nknor,\" the play at ball. Nurspel is simply ball-play, therefore which\r\nname, taken in connection with the fact that the game is elsewhere\r\ncalled \"Spell and Knor,\" and not \"Knor and Spell,\" is significant. There\r\nis one day in the year, Shrove Tuesday, when the play is customarily\r\npractised, though not quite exclusively.--Atkinson's _Cleveland\r\nGlossary_.\r\n\r\nEasther (_Almondbury Glossary_) describes it as played with a wooden\r\nball, a spel, and a pommel. Two may play, or two sides. When a player\r\ngoes in he drives the knor for, say, 100 yards, _i.e._, five score, and\r\nhe reckons five. Each person has the same number of strokes previously\r\nagreed upon, but generally only one innings. The \"spell\" is a kind of\r\nstage with three or four feet, to drive it into the ground. On the top\r\nof this stage is a spring made of steel, containing a cup to receive the\r\n\"knor,\" which is about one or two inches in diameter, and is made of\r\nholly or box. The spring is kept down by a sneck, which is tapped by the\r\npommel when the knor is intended to be struck. The pommel is thus\r\nformed--the driving part is frequently of ash-root or owler, in shape\r\nlike half a sugar-loaf split lengthwise, but only three or four inches\r\nlong, and the handle is of ash, wrapped with a wax band where held,\r\nwhich is in one hand only.\r\n\r\nSee \"Kibel and Nerspel,\" \"Trap Ball,\" \"Trippit and Coit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNuts in May\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n--Shropshire (Miss Burne).\r\n\r\n    I.

The first line\r\nsings the first, third, and fifth verses, and the opposite line the\r\nsecond and fourth. At the end of the fifth verse a handkerchief or other\r\nmark is laid on the ground, and the two children (whose names have been\r\nmentioned, and who are as evenly matched as possible), take each other's\r\nright hand and endeavour to pull each other over the handkerchief to\r\ntheir own side (fig. 2). The child who is pulled over the handkerchief\r\nbecomes the \"captured nut,\" and joins the side of her capturers. Then\r\nthe game begins again by the second line singing the first, third, and\r\nfifth verses, while advancing to gather or capture the \"nuts,\" the first\r\nline responding with the second and fourth verses, and the same finish\r\nas before. Then the first line begins the game, and so on until all the\r\nchildren are in this way matched one against the other.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Other versions have been sent me, with slight variations: NUTS IN\r\nMAY, with the verses ending, \"On a fine summer morning,\" from Lincoln\r\nand Nottinghamshire (Miss M. Peacock); \"So early in the morning,\"\r\nSporle, Norfolk (Miss Matthews); \"Six o'clock in the morning,\"\r\nNottingham (Miss Wenfield); \"On a cold and frosty morning,\" East Kirkby,\r\nLincolnshire (Miss K. Maughan); Barnes (A. B. Gomme), Colchester (Miss\r\nG. M. Frances). NUTS AND MAY: \"On a bright and sunny morning\" (Mr. C. C.\r\nBell); \"On a cold and frosty morning,\" Forest of Dean (Miss Matthews);\r\n\"Every night and morning,\" Gainford, Durham (Miss Edleston); \"We've\r\npicked [Sally Gray] for nuts in May,\" \"All on a summer's morning,\"\r\nSheffield (Mr. S. O. Addy). A version by Miss Kimber (Newbury, Berks,\r\nand Marlborough, Wilts) ends each verse, \"Nuts and May.\" In other\r\nrespects these variants are practically the same. Printed versions not\r\ngiven above are Hersham, Surrey (_Folk-lore Record_, v. 85); Burne's\r\n_Shropshire Folk-lore_, p. 516; Sulhampstead, Berks (_Antiquary_, vol.\r\nxxvii., Miss E. E. Thoyts); and Dorsetshire, \"Gathering nuts away\"\r\n(_Folk-lore Journal_, vii. 225). From Longcot, Berks, a version sent me\r\nby Miss I. Barclay has no fourth line to the verses.\r\n\r\n(_d_) This game is probably, unless we except \"Mulberry Bush,\" the most\r\npopular and the most widely played of any singing game. It might almost\r\nbe called universal. This is shown by the fact that there are few\r\ncounties where it is not known, and also that important variants, either\r\nin the words or in the method of playing, are rarely met with. In all\r\nthe versions which have been sent there are only the following\r\nvariations in the words, and these are principally in the refrain, or\r\nlast line of each verse: \"On a cold and frosty morning\" ends by far the\r\ngreater number of versions; \"On a fine summer's morning,\" \"So early in\r\nthe morning,\" \"All on a summer's morning,\" \"Five o'clock in the\r\nmorning,\" \"On a cold and sunny morning,\" coming next in number. The\r\nBelfast version ends, \"May! May! May!\" and a Newbury and Marlborough\r\nfourth line is simply a repetition of the second, \"Nuts in May, nuts in\r\nMay.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first line of the verse the only important variant seems to be\r\nthe Symondsbury \"Gathering nuts away\" and \"Gathering nuts to-day.\"\r\n\"Gathering nuts away\" also occurs in one version from Newbury (Berks),\r\n\"Nuts and May\" appearing in the larger number after the more usual \"Nuts\r\nin May.\" In only one version is a specific place mentioned for the\r\ngathering. This is in the Bocking version, where Galloway Hill is named,\r\nin reply to the unusual question, \"Where do you gather your nuts in\r\nMay?\" A player is usually gathered for \"Nuts in May.\" In three or four\r\ncases only is this altered to gathering a player's \"nuts away,\" which is\r\nobviously an alteration to try and make the action coincide exactly with\r\nthe words. The game is always played in \"lines,\" and the principal\r\nincidents running throughout all the versions are the same, _i.e._, one\r\nplayer is selected by one line of players from their opponents' party.\r\nThe \"selected\" one is refused by her party unless some one from the\r\nopposite side can effect her capture by a contest of strength. In all\r\nversions but two or three this contest takes place between the two; in\r\none or two all the players join in the trial of strength. In another\r\ninstance there appears to be no contest, but the selected player crosses\r\nover to the opposite side. Two important incidents occur in the Bocking\r\nand Symondsbury versions. In the Bocking game the side which is\r\nvictorious has the right to begin the next game first: this also occurs\r\nin the Barnes version. In Symondsbury, when one child is drawn over the\r\nboundary line by one from the opposite side she has to be \"crowned\"\r\nimmediately. This is done by the conqueror putting her hand on the\r\ncaptured one's head. If this is not done at once the captured one is at\r\nliberty to return to her own side. In some versions (Shropshire and\r\nLondon) the player who is selected for \"Nuts\" is always captured by the\r\none sent to fetch her. Some Barnes children also say that this is the\r\nproper way to play. When boys and girls play the boys are always sent to\r\n\"fetch away\" the girls. In Sheffield (a version collected by Mr. S. O.\r\nAddy) a boy is chosen to fetch the girl away; and in the Earls Heaton\r\nversion the line runs, \"We'll have a girl for nuts in May.\"\r\n\r\n(_e_) There is some analogy in the game to marriage by capture, and to\r\nthe marriage customs practised at May Day festivals and gatherings. For\r\nthe evidence for marriage by capture in the game there is no element of\r\nlove or courtship, though there is the obtaining possession of a member\r\nof an opposing party. But it differs from ordinary contest-games in the\r\nfact that one party does not wage war against another party for\r\npossession of a particular piece of ground, but individual against\r\nindividual for the possession of an individual. That the player sent to\r\nfetch the selected girl is expected to conquer seems to be\r\nimplied--first, by a choice of a certain player being made to effect the\r\ncapture; secondly, by the one sent \"to fetch\" being always successful;\r\nand thirdly, the \"crowning\" in the Symondsbury game. Through all the\r\ngames I have seen played this idea seems to run, and it exactly accords\r\nwith the conception of marriage by capture. For examples of the actual\r\nsurvivals in English, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish customs of marriage by\r\ncapture see Gomme's _Folk-lore Relics of Early Village Life_, pp.\r\n204-210.\r\n\r\nThe question is, How does this theory of the origin of the game fit in\r\nwith the term \"Nuts in May\"? I attribute this to the gathering by\r\nparties of young men of bunches of May at the May festivals and dances,\r\nto decorate not only the Maypole, May \"kissing-bush,\" but the doors of\r\nhouses. \"Knots of May\" is a term used by children, meaning bunches of\r\nMay. Thus, a note by Miss Fowler in the MS. of the games she had\r\ncollected says, \"In Bucks the children speak of 'knots of May,' meaning\r\neach little bunch of hawthorn blossom.\" The gathering of bunches of May\r\nby parties of young men and maidens to make the May-bush round which the\r\nMay Day games were held, and dancing and courting, is mentioned by Wilde\r\n(_Irish Popular Superstitions_, p. 52), the game being \"Dance in the\r\nRing.\" Holland (_Cheshire Glossary_) says, \"May birches were branches of\r\ndifferent kinds of trees fastened over doors of houses and on the\r\nchimney on the eve of May Day. They were fastened up by parties of young\r\nmen who went round for the purpose, and were intended to be symbolical\r\nof the character of the inmates.\" I remember one May Day in London, when\r\nthe \"May girls\" came with a garland and short sticks decorated with\r\ngreen and bunches of flowers, they sang--\r\n\r\n    Knots of May we've brought you,\r\n      Before your door it stands;\r\n    It is but a sprout, but it's well budded out\r\n      By the work of the Lord's hands,\r\n\r\nand a Miss Spencer, who lived near Hampton (Middlesex), told me that she\r\nwell remembered the May girls singing the first verse of this carol,\r\nusing \"knots\" instead of the more usual word \"branch\" or \"bunch,\" and\r\nthat she knew the small bunch of May blossom by the name of \"knots\" of\r\nMay, \"bringing in knots of May\" being a usual expression of children.\r\n\r\nThe association of May--whether the month, or the flower, or both--with\r\nthe game is very strong, the refrain \"cold and frosty morning,\" \"all on\r\na summer's morning,\" \"bright summer's morning,\" \"so early in the\r\nmorning,\" also being characteristic of the early days of May and spring,\r\nand suggests that the whole day from early hours is given up to holiday.\r\nThe familiar nursery rhyme given by Halliwell--\r\n\r\n    Here we come a-piping,\r\n    First in spring and then in May,\r\n\r\nno doubt also refers to house-to-house visiting of May.\r\n\r\nThe connection between the May festival and survival in custom of\r\nmarriage by capture is well illustrated by a passage from Stubbe's\r\n_Anatomie of Abuses_, p. 148. He says: \"Against May Day, Whitsonday, or\r\nother time, euery Parishe, Towne and Village assemble themselves\r\ntogether, bothe men women and children, olde and yong, . . . and either\r\ngoyng all together or diuidyng themselues into companies, they goe some\r\nto the Woodes and groves where they spend all the night in plesant\r\npastimes; and in the morning they return bringing with them birch and\r\nbranches of trees to deck their assemblies withall . . . and then they\r\nfall to daunce about it like as the heathen people did. . . . I have\r\nheard it credibly reported (and that _viva voce_) by men of great\r\ngrauitie and reputation, that of fortie, threescore or a hundred maides\r\ngoing to the wood ouer night, there haue scaresly the third part of them\r\nreturned home againe undefiled.\" Herrick's _Hesperides_ also describes\r\nthe festival, and the custom of courting and marriage at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe tune sung to this game appears to be the same in every version.\r\n\r\n\r\n  END OF VOL.

This has not been changed.\r\n\r\nPage 328: reference to the game Spanish Fly, which does not occur in\r\neither volume (nor does the phrase).\r\n\r\nPage 402: reference to Ghost in the Garden and Ghost in the Copper.\r\nNeither is described as a separate game; probably the reference is to\r\nGhost at the Well.\r\n\r\n\r\nTextual remarks:\r\n\r\nAt least some of the quotations presented by the author are not verbatim\r\nquotations, they have been edited by the author (for example Aubrey on\r\ncockle-bread).\r\n\r\nVolume II.\r\n\r\nIn the Addenda, the original work uses Arabic rather than Roman numerals\r\nfor different variants; this has not been changed.\r\n\r\nThe original work uses both 2-4 and 2/4 to indicate musical time; this\r\nhas not been standardised.\r\n\r\nPage 199: Love another like sister and brother is probably a mistake\r\n(Love one another like sister and brother).\r\n\r\nPage 336/7: The original work does not give a source or authority for\r\nvariation XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges made to the original text:\r\n\r\nFootnotes have been moved to end of the description of the game.\r\n\r\nSources (when printed in smaller type in the original work) have been\r\nmoved to a separate line where necessary.\r\n\r\nVolume I.\r\n\r\nThe Errata have already been changed in the text.\r\n\r\nGallovidian Encyclopedia/Encyclopædia has been standardised to\r\nGallovidian Encyclopædia.\r\n\r\nPage xvi: Conqueror changed to Conqueror or Conkers (as in text)\r\n\r\nPage xvii: Duckstone was missing from the list and has been added\r\n\r\nPage xix: Lend me your Key was missing from the list and has been added\r\n\r\nPage 19: we'll go the king changed to we'll go to the king\r\n\r\nPage 24: Hurstmonceaux changed to Hurstmonceux (as elsewhere)\r\n\r\nPage 56: he jostled away changed to be jostled away\r\n\r\nPage 128: [They pull him out. changed to [They pull him out.]\r\n\r\nPage 180 (table) row 16: [ added before Write\r\n\r\nPage 270: so that won't do changed to so _that_ won't do (as elsewhere\r\nin the song)\r\n\r\nPage 329: cul léve changed to cul levé (as in Nares's work)\r\n\r\nPage 364 uniniated changed to uninitiated\r\n\r\nPage 387: the Sheffield is changed to the Sheffield version is.",
