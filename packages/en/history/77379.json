Their restoration could not have been\r\nhad under any other condition than that which came about at the close\r\nof our gigantic struggle.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War was waged on both the Federal and Confederate sides with\r\nan intensity and manly vigor characteristic of the race that sprang\r\nfrom the loins of the Puritan and the Cavalier.\r\n\r\nThe immense hosts that combated upon so many dreadful fields, with\r\nthe incident sacrifice of life and limb, while actuated by the desire\r\nto win, by comparison with which individual loss counted as nothing,\r\nwere never prompted by personal hatred or ill will. They fought to\r\nobtain the result desired, and when the end came, with its feeling of\r\nexultation by the one and of depression by the other, there was mutual\r\nrespect and common consideration, that led naturally to a reunited\r\ncountry and the placing of the Great Republic in its present position\r\nas the Chiefest of Nations.\r\n\r\nThe story permits a description of two great battles--that of\r\nMurfreesboro, or Stone’s River, and of Chattanooga, or Mission\r\nRidge--the first-named one of the hardest fought fields of the War,\r\nand the last, one of the most spectacular. The recital of these calls\r\nfor no explanation, and I hope the personal equation of the story needs\r\nno apology.\r\n\r\n  CHARLES F. MANDERSON,\r\n\r\n    Late Colonel, 19th Regiment Ohio Infantry.\r\n    B’v’t Brig. Gen. Vols., U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “RESTING QUIETLY IN THEIR POLISHED CASE OF DARK MAHOGANY\r\nWITH ITS SOFT LINING OF TUFTED CRIMSON SILK.”]\r\n\r\nResting quietly in their polished case of dark mahogany, with its\r\nsoft lining of tufted crimson silk, they look harmless indeed and as\r\nthough their lives had been uneventful. Yet, could they speak with\r\nother tongues than those of fire and smoke, they could tell a tale to\r\ninterest and thrill--of scenes of bloody encounter and deadly strife,\r\nof combat and carnage, of victory and defeat, of raid and destruction,\r\nof pursuit and capture, of loss and recovery, of separation and\r\nreunion,--in short, the exciting story of war, and the captivating tale\r\nof peace.\r\n\r\nYou take up the pair of revolvers with a new interest. Yes! they are\r\nhandsome. Shapely and well proportioned, they deserve your exclamation\r\nof admiration. The blued steel of barrels and cylinders contrasts\r\nattractively with the silver mounting of the handles, so well fitted to\r\nthe grasp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “YOU TAKE THEM IN HAND!\r\n\r\n                                           YOU GLANCE ALONG THE SIGHTS!”\r\n]\r\n\r\nYou take them in hand! You glance along the sights! Ah! my friend, time\r\nwas when the threatening glint of the eye that brought these sights\r\nin line was quite different from the gentle light in yours. And now\r\nyou read inquiringly the inscription, showing the presentation, deeply\r\nengraved upon the silver handle band of each seven shooter. Yes, I am\r\nthe regimental commander to whom they were presented, by the braves of\r\nthe gallant 19th Regiment of Ohio Infantry, nearly forty years ago. I\r\nhad lived but little over half that many years, when they came to me\r\nand, since the date you read upon them, I have grown grizzled.\r\n\r\nThe scene of the presentation, the causes that led to it and the after\r\nevents of note, are as vivid as though they were of yesterday and yet\r\nthere is the strange feeling as though I spoke of some other and not\r\nof myself. I take it that most of us who served through those four\r\nmomentous years of gigantic war now feel as though the experiences were\r\nthose of a third person, of whom we had knowledge, intimate indeed, but\r\nwith whom we had not identity. As you ask for the story, it shall be\r\ngiven unto you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PAGE\r\n\r\n  PROLOGUE                  5\r\n\r\n\r\n            SCENE I.\r\n\r\n  The Battle                9\r\n\r\n\r\n           SCENE II.\r\n\r\n  The Presentation         24\r\n\r\n\r\n          SCENE III.\r\n\r\n  The Capture              29\r\n\r\n\r\n           SCENE IV.\r\n\r\n  The Reunion              44\r\n\r\n\r\n  Epilogue                 51\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Twin Seven-Shooters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE I.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recital will start fairly on Christmas day of the year 1862, near\r\nNashville, in the camps of the Army of the Cumberland, then commanded\r\nby General Rosecrans.\r\n\r\nThe festive holiday time had increased the usually present disease,\r\nuntil home-sickness was the all-pervading complaint. As the picket\r\npeered through the gloomy air under the dull, wintry sky, he saw, in\r\nhis mind’s eye, the dear ones at home, gathered about the yule-log.\r\nThe sentry’s thoughts were far away, as he challenged the approaching\r\nguard, that brought relief, but gave none save in name, and received\r\nthe sharp replies, so different from the words of good cheer properly\r\nincident to the time. The men gathered about the camp fires during the\r\nevening hours with abortive attempts at merriment, soon to be given\r\nup, and then to talk in whispers of friends and family and home. The\r\nbugle calls, holding out the promise that balmy sleep might bring\r\nforgetfulness, were welcomed; although tattoo seemed a wail, and\r\nlights-out a sob.\r\n\r\nThe restless quiet of a great military camp comes at last. A nest of\r\nsleeping souls, it heaves with sound. The sentinels look like stalking\r\nghosts.\r\n\r\nAfter midnight the dreaming sleepers are disturbed by the clank of the\r\nsabre of the orderly, seeking the headquarters of regiments to deliver\r\nan important order. Be quick! Light the candle stuck in the bayonet\r\nshank at the head of the ground bed where lies the regimental commander.\r\n\r\nAh! Here is a Christmas gift with a vengeance! Read!\r\n\r\n  “You will place your command in readiness to march at daylight.\r\n  Move very light--three days’ rations in haversacks and two days’ in\r\n  wagons. Forty rounds of ammunition on each man, with all the reserve\r\n  ammunition in wagons. Take no tents and no baggage.”\r\n\r\nA battle order! Up and be stirring, for there is much to be done\r\nbefore daylight. Sleepers are aroused, their dreams of home and its\r\nfestivities rudely disturbed, tents are struck and rolled, and, with\r\nthe baggage and surplus stores packed into wagons to be sent within the\r\nearth-works of Nashville.\r\n\r\nReveille finds the Army of the Cumberland, nearly fifty thousand\r\nstrong, on the march to attack the Confederates under Bragg at\r\nMurfreesborough, thirty miles away. No holiday march this, I assure\r\nyou. The enemy is alert. He harasses our front with artillery, attacks\r\nour flanks with infantry and harries our rear with cavalry. The\r\nelements seem in league with him, for snow, sleet and rain make heavy\r\nroads, at which men swear and in which wagons and artillery flounder\r\nand stall.\r\n\r\nFour days of skirmishing and hard marching, with four nights of unrest\r\nand chilly misery bring us to our objective--the enemy. He has selected\r\nhis battle ground on the bank of Stone’s River, a swift stream, in\r\nplaces fordable.\r\n\r\nThe night of December 30th we slept, or essayed to sleep, upon our\r\narms, without fires. Never can I forget the dispirited and woe-begone\r\nlook of the men as, rising from the frozen ground, they shook\r\nthemselves at daylight. The hoar-frost covered them, giving to the\r\nuniforms of blue a new color, resembling somewhat the grey of the foe.\r\nIs there fighting quality in this line of shivering men? Can the battle\r\nfire be kindled in these chilled frames? A cold breakfast from the\r\nhaversacks, a tin cup of coffee to each man, a warming drill in the\r\nmanual of arms and their appearance is changed for the better.\r\n\r\nThe order comes! We are to cross Stone’s River at the lower ford and\r\nlead the attack upon the enemy’s right. Rosecrans will strike with his\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the guns, a distribution of ammunition, filling both\r\ncartridge boxes and haversacks, some words of encouragement and cheer\r\nfrom the youthful commander, and we move to the river bank, to find\r\nour crossing, by wading the cold stream, unopposed by the enemy. We\r\nform in line of battle upon the other side and are about to advance to\r\nthe attack, when the sound of cannon, heard but faintly from our right\r\na short time ago, becomes louder and more loud. A terrific battle is\r\nraging there and the movement of sound means our men are being driven.\r\nWe are halted. There is stir and excitement among the division staff.\r\nWe are ordered to recross the river and hasten to the support of the\r\nright wing.\r\n\r\nBragg, actuated by the same motive as Rosecrans, conceiving the same\r\nplan, had attacked our right, but his fresh and sheltered troops struck\r\ntheir blow at an earlier hour. They doubled our line back upon itself.\r\nThey took our straight bar of iron and bent it into a horse-shoe. Our\r\nright flank had become our rear.\r\n\r\nDefeat seemed imminent. On our hurried way, the 19th Ohio, leading\r\nCrittenden’s Division, met horses, teams and men in confusion most\r\nconfounded. Rousseau, of Kentucky, riding bare-headed, cries to me,\r\n“What troops are these?” and to my answer says, with tearful entreaty\r\nin his voice, “For God’s sake! get quickly to the cedars on our right\r\nand stop this rout.” We hasten on. Rosecrans, pale with anguish of the\r\nthought that Garesche, bosom friend and Chief of Staff, had just been\r\nkilled by his side, but determined of purpose and confident in bearing,\r\nsays, “Men! you can save the day. Will you do it?” “Aye! Aye! sir; if\r\nmortal men can, we will!”\r\n\r\nWe pass from the march by the flank into line under the direction of\r\nthe Commanding General himself, my regiment forming the right of the\r\nfront line.\r\n\r\nThe grey coats, flushed with success that is so near victory, came\r\ngaily on. We wait until they are within easy range. It is a weary\r\nwaiting and hard to endure. Our men are falling rapidly under the fire\r\nof the advancing foe. My favorite mare drops dead with a ball through\r\nher gentle heart. Adjutant Brewer, always alert and devoted replaces\r\nher with his good grey. Rising from the ground, with no great bodily\r\nharm, although I had been pitched headlong, I exclaim: “But, Adjutant,\r\nmy glasses are broken into many bits and I see dimly.” “Never mind; I\r\nwill see for you,” he quickly responds. And so he did. Gallant fellow!\r\nBrave heart! He gave his young life to his country and his parting\r\nbenediction to me afterwards, in a desperate mêlée and fearful\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARGE OF GENERAL VAN CLEVE’S DIVISION IN THE CEDARS, AT\r\nTHE BATTLE OF STONE’S RIVER, UNDER DIRECTION OF GENERAL ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nThe 19th Ohio Infantry forming the right of the front line. Photograph\r\nof a picture made during the war by Private Mathews, of the 31st Ohio\r\nInfantry.]\r\n\r\nAt last the order to fire! From every musket leaps a missile of death.\r\nThe Confederate line wavers! Strong young teeth tear the cartridges. We\r\nload and fire with energy. The grey line breaks! A charge is ordered by\r\nRosecrans in person. They run! How inspiring! What exhilaration! With\r\nwild yells we rush on. We regain much of the ground lost in the early\r\nmorning and hold it fast and firm.\r\n\r\nAgain the nightfall, the last of the eventful year. What horrid din, of\r\ncannon and of watchful picket’s gun, to disturb and harass the weary\r\nunharmed, who seek to sleep. How cold and miserable the wounded in blue\r\nand grey who groan and moan between the lines, where succor cannot come.\r\n\r\nMorn at last! The new year has come. Both armies are so torn and\r\nshattered that the re-forming of lines and watchful rest is a\r\nnecessity. The day passes in care for the wounded and hasty burial of\r\nthe dead.\r\n\r\nAnother night, and again the morning. Who will strike the blow?\r\nRosecrans, tenacious of purpose, returns to his original plan. Again\r\nour division fords Stone’s River in front of the enemy’s right. The\r\nshortened line of each regiment tells the story of the slaughter of the\r\n31st. We wait patiently the order to strike.\r\n\r\nThe hours pass. Few in number, our division is a tempting bait to\r\nBragg. General Breckenridge, with a column of many lines, advances\r\nupon us. With precision of movement they march across the open fields.\r\nThe sight fascinates us! Splendid spectacle! They break the charm by\r\nopening fire and charging upon us with the shrill yell of the South.\r\nWith a crash the lines meet, to mingle a moment and break apart. Our\r\nreserve becomes our front line. We fight for minutes that seem hours,\r\nwith bayonet and clubbed musket, with deep cursing and loud yells, with\r\nhot rage and bold defiance, that rarest of happenings in battle comes\r\nto us--a hand to hand fight between lines of infantry upon an open\r\nfield. We are overwhelmed by numbers and flanked by the greater force.\r\nThrice has our color bearer been felled to earth, and of all the color\r\nguard not one is unhurt.\r\n\r\nBut the regimental flag does not touch the ground. Gallant Phil Reefy,\r\nLieutenant of Company F, strong and stalwart, bears it aloft. Sullenly\r\nwe retreat to the river bank, fighting as we retire. We reach the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nWhat is that deafening roar? It is as though heaven and earth had come\r\ntogether. Fifty-two guns, massed by Mendenhall, Chief of Artillery,\r\ncommanding the position we had just left, have opened with grape and\r\ncanister at short range upon the but now exultant foe. What dreadful\r\nslaughter! Masses of men fall writhing as the missiles hurtle through\r\nthe air. They turn and flee, for mortal men cannot withstand such storm.\r\n\r\nWe pursue until darkness comes, capturing prisoners, guns and stores,\r\nand Reefy, proudly exultant, plants the flag of the 19th Ohio upon two\r\ncannon captured in the tempestuous pursuit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REPULSE OF THE ATTACK OF THE COLUMN OF GENERAL\r\nBRECKENRIDGE, BEING THE CLOSING SCENE OF THE BATTLE OF STONE’S RIVER.\r\n\r\nMade from a picture drawn by Private Mathews, of the 31st Regiment,\r\nOhio Infantry, during the war.]\r\n\r\nNo battle of the war shows the dash, pluck, bravery and endurance\r\nof the American soldier better than Stone’s River. The attack, so\r\nspirited and bold, upon the right wing, under McCook, in the gray dawn\r\nof that winter morning, that forced it back until the exultant\r\nenemy was not only on our flank but in our rear! The speedy taking of\r\nnew positions by the troops of the left wing, under Crittenden; their\r\ngallant and successful charge in the cedars that regained much of the\r\nground so ruinously lost!\r\n\r\nThe sturdy and immovable stand of the center, under Thomas, that\r\nresisted assaults most impetuous and broke the charging columns into\r\ndisorganized fragments, as waves are broken on a rock-bound coast! The\r\ndash of the Southerners in attack, the steadiness of the Northerners\r\nin resistance, the impulsive ardor of the one, the deliberate repose\r\nof the other; both so characteristic! The bold front, the confident\r\ndaring, the personal exposure, the actual leadership, and the\r\nunconquerable spirit of Rosecrans, that “plucked victory from defeat\r\nand glory from disaster!”\r\n\r\nAll this, any of this, was worth the sacrifice of life itself to see.\r\n\r\nIt stands in history as a bright page. The dreadful figures of loss\r\ntell the story of how terribly sanguinary were the engagements when\r\nAmericans fought each other. Of 44,000 Federals, 12,000, and of 38,000\r\nConfederates, 10,000 were killed and wounded--over twenty-five per\r\ncent. Recall the fact that at Waterloo, Wellington lost less than\r\ntwelve, and at Marengo and Austerlitz, Napoleon lost less than fifteen\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nAt daylight the next morning, after the battle, my line was formed.\r\nShorn was it of half its length, for forty per cent. had fallen. Three\r\nofficers were killed and three wounded. Company B, with more of its\r\nown dead to bury than there were unhurt survivors to do them honor.\r\nAh! the familiar faces gone from us. We who were left looked upon each\r\nother with feelings unknown before. We felt a kinship stronger than\r\nbrotherhood, as though we were parts of one body.\r\n\r\nWe heard read, with infinite satisfaction, of the glory of our\r\nachievements, the congratulations of the General and the thanks of\r\nPresident Lincoln. We shook hands with each other that we had been\r\nspecially mentioned in the reports, and took satisfactory delight that\r\nthe commander of the 79th Indiana had officially reported that the good\r\nbehavior of his command might be attributed to the splendid conduct of\r\nthe 19th Ohio, and to the effect of our example.\r\n\r\nWe were heroes all, and were proudly conscious of the fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe restful weeks following the great battle go slowly by. The ranks\r\nof the regiment fill up from the return of the slightly wounded and\r\nthe detached. The white tents about Murfreesborough, placed in regular\r\nrows, form a new city of vast extent. Camp duties, drills, inspection,\r\nreview, guard mounting and dress parade fill the busy hours. The\r\nfighting giant is in training for the summer campaign of Tullahoma and\r\nthe advance into Georgia.\r\n\r\nI recall the afternoon of a perfect day in the early spring time.\r\nParade over and dismissed, by some preconcerted signal, to me unknown,\r\nthe first sergeants do not march the men to quarters, but go to their\r\npositions and company commanders take their places in line. “Attention!\r\nBattalion!” shouts Major Stratton, assuming the command. I look on\r\nsomewhat amazed at this sudden devotion to a drill not down in the camp\r\norders.\r\n\r\nThe battalion forms square. I am invited to it, and with speech all too\r\ncomplimentary and feeling reference to the great battle, its losses and\r\nits gains, am presented with the beautiful weapons you here admire.\r\n\r\nThe surprise is only excelled by my delight with the gift. They shall\r\nbe worn with pride, they shall be used in honor.\r\n\r\nI cherish them for the sake of the givers, and practice to know how and\r\nto become worthy to use them. They stand me in good stead very often,\r\nand familiarity with them does not breed contempt of their power.\r\n\r\nMonths go by. The Tullahoma campaign has been fought to a finish. On\r\nostensible recruiting service, but really for participation in the\r\nmomentous Brough-Vallandigham campaign in Ohio, the opportunity is\r\nafforded me to go home for a brief season. I avail myself of it, and\r\ntake proudly home to show to friends the gift of comrades beloved.\r\n\r\nThe duty in the north performed, I turn south to rejoin the command.\r\nThe military situation is most interesting. Like the sharp end of\r\na lance, the western army has pierced into the very vitals of the\r\nConfederacy. Rosecrans has won his objective, Chattanooga; paying\r\ntherefor the bloody penalty of Chickamauga, but is practically besieged\r\nby an enemy whose camp fires light the many miles of horizon, from\r\nwhere the crouching lion of lofty Lookout Mountain, with extended paws,\r\ntouches the Tennessee, around the semi-circle of frowning ridges to\r\nwhere the strongly intrenched line again touches the deep flowing river\r\nat Tunnel Hill. He is relieved from command by the powers that be, and\r\nThomas, the reliable, the Rock of Chickamauga, beloved of all men,\r\ntakes his place as chief. He declares his intention to hold his great\r\nstrategic position “until we starve,” and unless help comes, starvation\r\nseems probable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL GEORGE H. THOMAS\r\n\r\n“The Rock of Chickamauga.”]\r\n\r\nHooker is on his way from the east with two corps of veterans of the\r\nPotomac, and Sherman marches to us with the victorious columns, flushed\r\nwith the capture of Vicksburg, from the banks of the Mississippi.\r\nThe great Captain, with the fame of Fort Donelson and Shiloh, comes\r\nalso, to assume supreme command. Grant! Sherman! Thomas! Behold the\r\ntriumvirate! Truly, the great game of war is now to be played by\r\nexperts. I hasten to take place as one of the pawns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere the fight was the fiercest at Stone’s River, Captain Keel, of\r\nours, in gallant leadership of his company, was shot in the elbow of\r\nhis right arm. Surgical skill had prevented amputation and obtained\r\nexsection, resulting in a cartilaginous elbow and sorely crippled hand.\r\nThus maimed, he came to me at Nashville and declared his intention of\r\nreporting for duty. Condemning his judgment, but admiring his pluck, I\r\nsaid, “All right, Captain, we will take the first train for the front.”\r\n\r\nWe reached Stevenson, Alabama, the end of our ride over rough and\r\nworn pieces of iron, dignified by the name of railroad. From there a\r\nmountain wagon road formed the connection with the army at Chattanooga.\r\nIts course could be traced by the fragments of broken wagons, abandoned\r\nstores, and by the carcasses of the poor mules, strangled in the mud of\r\nit. Trains laden with ammunition, food and forage started daily from\r\nStevenson. The time of their arrival, at the end of the pontoon bridge\r\nacross from Chattanooga was an unknown quantity. It was at least two\r\nand more frequently four days.\r\n\r\nMy anxiety to reach the regiment was intense. Upon inquiry I heard of a\r\nbridle path leading over the mountain and along the bank of the river.\r\nBy starting early and riding hard, one might get through in a day, but\r\nit was the path of danger. The guns of the Confederates commanded this\r\nroad, and some of our men had been killed, others wounded and captured,\r\nwho tried it. I determined to make the effort. The Colonel commanding\r\nthe post, in response to my earnest appeal, loaned me two horses and an\r\norderly, and we started at the first peep of day.\r\n\r\nKeel, too greatly disabled to ride a horse, was to go by the wagon\r\nroad, taking the baggage of both. He evinced no reluctance when he\r\nfound that as companions in the same wagon he was to have two estimable\r\nwomen of the Christian Commission, who, with supplies for the sick and\r\nwounded, were bound to Chattanooga upon their heaven inspired mission.\r\n\r\nRealizing that my route was hazardous, I put on my oldest uniform,\r\nstripped myself of all valuables, packing them carefully in the trunk\r\nthat contained all of my earthly possessions. Determined that my\r\nbeloved pistols should not fall into the hands of the enemy, I lodged\r\nthem securely in my trunk, taking in their stead a pair of common\r\nholster revolvers.\r\n\r\nThe orderly and I rode through without mishap, receiving no shot and\r\nseeing but few of the enemy. Arrived at regimental headquarters, I\r\nfound all well, and received a welcome home that thrilled me. I waited,\r\nsomewhat impatiently, for the disabled Captain to arrive with the\r\nbaggage so greatly needed.\r\n\r\nThe days passed away and gave no sign of him until the fifth after my\r\narrival, when a sorry figure rode to the front of my tent. Seated upon\r\na mule that had upon him parts of wagon harness, was the Captain, a\r\nwoful figure, with rueful countenance. Don Quixote appeared not so\r\ndisconsolate even after his battle with the knights of the windmill. We\r\nwould have laughed aloud at his sorry plight had his aspect not been\r\nso serious. “For God’s sake, food and drink!” he cried. Being properly\r\nrefreshed, he told his tale of woe. The train of wagons was proceeding\r\nslowly along the weary road, when sharp firing at its front evidenced\r\nan attack. Wheeler’s cavalry had crossed the river and was on one of\r\nthe raids in our rear that made the name of General Joe Wheeler one\r\nwith which to scare teamsters and worry commanders.\r\n\r\nThe Captain was a man of proper gallantry, a fitting squire of dames,\r\nbut, withal, not lacking in judicious discretion. The Confederate\r\ntroopers certainly would not molest the women, bent upon their\r\nrighteous mission, but to him captivity meant worse than death. Making\r\nhasty excuses, in unceremonious fashion, he jumped from the wagon,\r\npulled a colored teamster off of a mule that he had just cut out of the\r\ntraces of a wagon, mounted and took quickly to the woods on the side\r\nof the mountain. As he plunged deeper into the thicket, he saw in the\r\nvalley the light of burning wagons, and heard the terrific explosions\r\nof ammunition with which many of them were loaded. After days and\r\nnights of distress he at last found his way to our camps.\r\n\r\nA day or two after, hearing that the female companions of the good\r\ncaptain had reached our lines, I called upon them in the town and heard\r\nthe rest of the story. Wheeler’s rough riders had treated them with\r\ncourteous consideration and did not molest their trunks when told that\r\nthey contained only woman’s apparel. Keel’s baggage and my own was\r\nevidently rich booty. The new uniforms were seized with delight, and\r\nmy precious seven-shooters appropriated with exclamations of joy and\r\nadmiration. Taking what was wanted, the residue was thrown back on the\r\nwagons, that had been run and piled together, and made food for the\r\nflames. The train was but partly consumed when our cavalry appeared\r\nupon the scene and a sharp fight ensued, with the result that the women\r\nwere released from their unpleasant situation.\r\n\r\nWhile the beleaguered army in Chattanooga, foregoing, if not\r\nforgetting, the pangs of hunger, echoed the language of Thomas in his\r\ntelegram to Grant, “We will hold this place until we starve,” it was\r\nwith right good will that it marched out in front of its works on an\r\neventful November morning, being ordered to make a “demonstration” and\r\nrelieve the pressure on Sherman in his effort to take Tunnel Hill,\r\nthe right flank of the semi-circular natural defense of the enemy,\r\ncomposed of Missionary Ridge, with its crest from five hundred to eight\r\nhundred feet above us, around to Lookout on the left with its proud\r\nhead over two thousand feet above the town. It was a crescent, with\r\ndefensive works erected with engineering skill, bristling with guns and\r\nreflecting threatening lights as the sun played upon the musket barrels\r\nand bayonets in the hands of skilled and brave defenders. It looked\r\nlike the curve of the cutting edge of a huge scimitar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE BATTLEFIELD OF CHATTANOOGA SHOWING THE\r\nPOSITION OF THE CONFEDERATE ARMY AT LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN AND MISSION RIDGE.]\r\n\r\nA feeling of amity, almost of fraternization, had existed between the\r\npicket lines in front of Wood’s division for many days. In the early\r\nmorning of that day, being in charge of the left of our picket line,\r\nI received a turn-out and salute from the Confederate reserve as\r\nI rode the line. But the friendly relation was soon to be rudely\r\ndisturbed. My pickets, composed of the 19th Ohio and the 9th Kentucky,\r\nbecame the line of skirmishers. Our troops being well out of their\r\nworks, we advanced with our left resting on Citico Creek, and I believe\r\nthat from these regiments came the first shots in that glorious advance\r\nthat resulted in the taking of Orchard Knob, the key of the enemy’s\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nWith impatient joy they witnessed the stars and stripes on Lookout’s\r\ncrest, and heard the guns of Hooker on the enemy’s left. The evidences\r\nof the hard fighting by Sherman and the stubborn resistance Bragg’s\r\nright was giving him were borne on every wind. The flanking assaults\r\nupon the Ridge were not achieving success. There must be another\r\n“demonstration” by the center. Grant stands on Orchard Knob, silently\r\nsmoking the inevitable cigar. He sees the heavy work to the right and\r\nleft and that the waning day is showing its lengthening shadows. The\r\ncenter must again relieve the pressure. To Thomas goes the order: “Take\r\nthe rifle-pits at the foot of the ridge. At the six-gun signal from\r\nOrchard Knob, advance the lines to the attack.” Baird, Wood, Sheridan\r\nand Johnson were quickly in the order named from left to right.\r\n\r\nRestlessly they await the signal. It is well on to four o’clock. At\r\nlast the sharp report of a cannon from the Knob! Another! and another!\r\nand in quick succession the six have thundered forth the order for the\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nTo your feet and forward, men of the Cumberland! “Take the rifle-pits\r\nat the foot of the ridge,” is the order. How splendidly they respond.\r\nAdding emphasis to their loud huzzas is the noise of the light\r\nartillery on the plain and the deep roar of the big siege guns in the\r\nforts of Chattanooga. The crest of the ridge throws its full weight of\r\nmetal at the lines of blue. The musketry fire from the pits is full in\r\ntheir faces. But neither shot nor shell can stop the impetuous advance.\r\nOn and on they go, surmounting every obstacle.\r\n\r\nThe order is obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe rifle-pits are ours and their late defenders our prisoners. How the\r\ngrey jackets hasten to the rear. We wonder at their haste, but soon\r\nunderstood it when the guns of the ridge, depressed to sweep the pits,\r\nseemed to open the gates of hell itself upon us.\r\n\r\nWe cannot stay. Must we fall back? Perish the thought. No! No! No\r\norder given, and yet to every man the impulse. Forward the whole line!\r\nTo the crest of the ridge and take the guns! Every man forward!\r\n\r\nGrape and canister from fifty cannon forbid the advance. Wood,\r\nSheridan, Baird, Johnson, Willich, Hazen, Beatty, Carlin, Turchin,\r\nVanderveer, catching the spirit from the men, shout, “Up, boys! To the\r\ntop!” and grape and canister, wounds and death are forgotten.\r\n\r\nOn and on and up and up we go, “while all the world wondered.” Grant\r\nturns to Thomas, and, with distress if not anger in his voice, says,\r\n“Who ordered those men up the ridge?” Replies our old hero, “I don’t\r\nknow, I did not.” Says Grant, “Granger, did you?” “No,” says Granger,\r\n“they started without orders. When those fellows get started, all\r\nhell can’t stop them.”\r\n\r\nWith hearts in their throats these anxious chieftains watch. The\r\nspectators in Chattanooga hold their breath in terrible suspense. It\r\nlooks a desperate venture, a foolhardy effort. Can they make the top,\r\nor will they be driven back to the plain, with columns broken and ranks\r\ndisordered?\r\n\r\nThe musketry fire from the intrenched line in grey is murderous. The\r\ncannon belch forth incessantly.\r\n\r\n“It is as though men fought upon the earth and fiends in the upper air.”\r\n\r\nNot a shot from the wedge-shaped lines in blue as they advance with the\r\ncolors of regiments at the apex of the triangles. Sixty regiments in\r\nrivalry for the lead! Colors fall as their bearers sink in death, but\r\nother stout arms nerved by brave hearts bear the flag aloft.\r\n\r\nAh! the lines waver! they cannot make it! But repulse means defeat and\r\nloss of all we have gained.\r\n\r\nLook! again they go forward! Will they reach the crest? See! the\r\nanswer! A flag! the nation’s flag! Our flag upon the top! Another, and\r\nyet another! The crest breaks out in glory! It is the apotheosis of the\r\nbanner of the free!\r\n\r\nThe rebel lines are broken! We are into their works! Cheer upon cheer\r\n“set the wild echoes flying” from Tunnel Hill to Lookout! They tell of\r\nvictory! glorious, exultant victory.\r\n\r\nForty pieces of cannon and 7,000 stand of arms with 6,000 prisoners\r\ncaptured give emphasis to the story.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL GEORGE H. THOMAS AND STAFF AFTER THE BATTLE OF\r\nMISSION RIDGE.]\r\n\r\nThe bars are down for entrance next campaign to Atlanta, gate city of\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\nI went through the starvation siege of Chattanooga, the battles of\r\nOrchard Knob and Mission Ridge, and the winter march to relieve\r\nBurnside, who was penned up in Knoxville, in very uncomfortable plight,\r\ndepending upon my brother officers for the clothing to keep me warm,\r\nbut that which caused me the most distress was the loss, as I naturally\r\nsupposed, forever, of the twin revolvers that rest now so peacefully\r\nbefore us, reminders of a time of great happenings by the side of which\r\nall else in life seems of trifling importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.\r\n\r\nTHE REUNION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “UPON THE WALL HUNG THE GOOD SWORD, WITH THE DENT IN ITS\r\nSCABBARD.”]\r\n\r\nTwenty years passed away, with their changes for good and for ill. The\r\ngreat war seemed like a dream, and its events were dim and shadowy. But\r\nthere remained to me some substantial evidence of its reality. Upon\r\nthe wall hung the good sword, with the dent in its scabbard telling of\r\nthe death struggle of the brave black mare, whose name should be on\r\nStone River’s roll of honor. In the corner stood the regimental flag,\r\npresented by my comrades when we parted in 1865, the deep scar upon its\r\nstaff matching the deeper scar upon the manly breast of its bearer\r\n“in the brave days of old.” I looked at them and longed for the twin\r\nseven-shooters that should keep them company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “IN THE CORNER STOOD THE REGIMENTAL FLAG PRESENTED BY MY\r\nCOMRADES WHEN WE PARTED IN 1865. THE DEEP SCAR UPON ITS STAFF MATCHED\r\nTHE DEEPER SCAR UPON THE MANLY BREAST OF ITS BEARER IN THE BRAVE DAYS\r\nOF OLD.”]\r\n\r\nRepresenting my adopted State, Nebraska, in the Senate, I had reached a\r\nposition that had at least given my name notoriety. It chanced that the\r\nMajor of an Iowa cavalry regiment saw it in the public prints and was\r\nprompted to write me. “Are you,” said he, “the man who commanded the\r\n19th Ohio during the war? If so, I have a pistol that must belong to\r\nyou, for the fact of its presentation is engraved upon it.” I am quick\r\nto respond, and in brief time there came the pistol, as welcome to my\r\nhand and heart as an old-time friend.\r\n\r\nHe wrote me its history. During the days of the period of\r\nreconstruction he was on duty in Alabama, and upon the person of a man\r\nwhom he arrested was found the revolver. The Major took it from him\r\nand had held it since, hoping that some time he might meet the owner.\r\nHearty thanks went to him, and I longed all the more for its mate,\r\nsomewhere existing, but probably never to be recovered by me.\r\n\r\nTwenty-eight years elapse after the cavalry raid in the Sequatchie\r\nValley. The Congress is in session and a dreary debate drags its\r\nweary length through the hours. My yawning presence in the Senate\r\nChamber would only add emphasis to the dullness there, and I go to the\r\nCommittee Room, to engage in the usual employment of a Congressman’s\r\nspare hours, the dictation of replies to the endless letters, from\r\nevery direction, on every conceivable subject. There comes a messenger,\r\nand this his message: “The compliments of Senator Pugh of Alabama, who\r\nrequests the pleasure of seeing you in the Marble Room.” I respond\r\nquickly to the call, and go to the room of simplicity and beauty that\r\nis one of the chief attractions under the great white dome. Near at\r\nhand are three men, two of them well known by me, the third a stranger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL JOSEPH WHEELER\r\n\r\n“The Marshal Ney of the Confederacy.”]\r\n\r\nI hasten to greet my colleague, and then shake hands with warmth of\r\ngreeting with a gentleman I have grown to respect and like. It is\r\nGeneral Wheeler, once a dashing cavalry leader of Confederates, he\r\nwho harried our rear so persistently and pronouncedly; reconstructed\r\ninto a leader in forensic debate, an authority on parliamentary law,\r\nand an all-around legislator, whose trenchant pen was surely as mighty\r\nas his vigorous sword. Cuba and the Philippines are the scenes of his\r\nlater triumphs, and there is no name upon the Army Roll more honored\r\nnow for patriotic devotion and soldierly ability than that of him who,\r\nduring the dark days of the civil strife, was the Marshal Ney of the\r\nConfederacy.\r\n\r\nI am introduced by the courtly Senator Pugh to his esteemed\r\nconstituent, ex-Confederate Colonel Reeves, of Alabama. I greet him\r\nwith pleasure, for he bears upon him those evidences that command\r\nrespect. Both appearance and speech declare the Southerner, and the\r\nsoft broad accents fall pleasingly upon the ear. He said, “I think,\r\nsir, I have something that once belonged to you, and will give it to\r\nyou with pleasure, for I presume from the inscription upon it you will\r\nprize it highly.”\r\n\r\nHe produces the long-lost revolver and tells its story. He bought it\r\nand its companion from one of General Wheeler’s troopers, who said\r\nhe captured it at the battle of Mission Ridge. I mildly suggest\r\nthat at Mission Ridge the captures were on the other side. He smiled\r\nacquiescence and said he cared little at the time of purchase from\r\nwhence they came, so that they might be his. He had carried them\r\nthrough the war until a fearful wound had disabled him from further\r\nfield duty.\r\n\r\nAfter the war he had loaned one to the sheriff of his county and from\r\nhim it had been captured by some of our troops. I told him of the\r\nreturn of that one to me eight years before. We exchange reminiscences\r\nof the great struggle. We compare experiences. Enemies in war, we are\r\nin peace friends.\r\n\r\nHandling his revolver with easy grace and caressing gesture, he\r\nmakes it mine again, saying as he passes it to me, with pardonable\r\nreluctance, “I tell you, sir, that is a mighty close shooting pistol.”\r\nI cordially agree to that sentiment, and we both dwell in thought upon\r\nthe career of these messengers of death that have fought beneath two\r\nflags, giving loyal support to their masters, who have fought each one\r\nloyally for his own.\r\n\r\nAnd thus finding each other, after a quarter of a century of\r\nseparation, they came back to me, to be cherished fondly and I hope\r\nnever again to be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so my friend, you have the truthful story. It is not one to excite\r\nspecial wonder, but causes, I take it, emotions of pleasure and\r\nthankfulness.\r\n\r\nAs the pistols have come peacefully together, so have north and south\r\nunited in fraternity and in devotion to one flag and a common country.\r\nThe war taught mutual respect, and never again can there come between\r\nthese sections the hatred, based upon mutual misunderstandings, that\r\nled to the attempt at dismemberment. The men who did the fighting\r\nduring those four years of bloody war can have no sympathy with the\r\nincendiaries who would array section against section upon any subject.\r\nTheir motto is bear and forbear. The disposition to fraternize was\r\nstrong among them even during the strife, and with them now is the\r\nbrotherhood that is the inevitable incident of unity of national\r\npurpose and a patriotic desire for one destiny.\r\n\r\nLong ago, while condemning the false teaching that led to the belief\r\nthat allegiance was to the State, we appreciated how deep abiding was\r\nthe honest conviction of those who, taught in a different school from\r\nus, made untold sacrifice for the cause they espoused.\r\n\r\nForgetting nothing of the past--the cruel blow at nationality, the\r\nunhallowed attack upon the flag, with all the sad results of weeping\r\nand wounds, of desolation and death--we have forgiven everything.\r\n\r\nFull citizenship, with all of honor, of governing power, and\r\ncontrolling rights that the term imports, has been accorded to all who\r\nparticipated or lent aid and comfort to the enemies of the Union.\r\n\r\nAs the victors and the vanquished have recognized equal courage and\r\neven powers of endurance, there has come mutual respect. Through the\r\nthroes and labor of reconstruction, with the contact of peoples, the\r\ninterchange of commerce, the common interests of the different parts of\r\nthe national whole, the dovetailing of States through the construction\r\nof the iron highways of trade, and mutual contribution of the capital\r\nneeded for the development of the new South has come peaceful,\r\ncontented reconciliation. The years that gather wisdom and experience\r\nto all long ago taught the lesson even to those who fought for it,\r\nthat the cause for which they struggled and suffered was better lost\r\nthan won.\r\n\r\nHail the epoch of concord! All hail, the era of fraternity!\r\n\r\nLet us close the lid of the mahogany box, believing that the pair\r\nsnugly ensconced within it shall never serve save as polished reminders\r\nof other days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nExtraneous quotation mark on page 11 removed.\r\n\r\nCorrected typo in illustration caption “battlelield” to “battlefield”.\r\n\r\nNormalized punctuation in illustration caption “CHARGE OF GENERAL....”\r\n\r\nPositions of illustrations re-arranged to support the main text.",
