The\r\nextensiveness of negro slavery in comparison with Indian slavery has so\r\nemphasized the former that, in the study of the institution in general,\r\nthe existence of Indian slavery during the colonial period has almost\r\nentirely been lost sight of. In this discussion it is shown that the\r\nenslavement of the natives was practiced by the Indians themselves, the\r\nSpanish, the French and the English; yet in the case of no one of the\r\nEuropean nations did it exist as a system separate and distinct from\r\nnegro slavery. Though the holding of Indians as slaves by three of the\r\nEuropean nations has been considered, it is the author’s intention to\r\nlay emphasis chiefly upon the institution as practiced by the English.\r\n\r\nThe fact that hitherto no special attention has been given to the\r\nsubject of Indian slavery has made the gathering of material difficult.\r\nMany of the important sources treating of the subject have never\r\nbeen published and are widely scattered. Much of even this material\r\nis vague in nature and consequently more or less unsatisfactory. The\r\nrapid increase in the number of negro slaves during the colonial period\r\nresulted in the general use of such terms as “slaves,” “negroes and\r\nother slaves” and “negroes,” without specification of Indian slaves as\r\nsuch. This is true particularly of the colonial laws, even in the case\r\nof those colonies where Indian slavery existed to the greatest extent.\r\n\r\nThe author desires to express his indebtedness to Mrs. N. M. Surrey\r\nfor her generous permission to use manuscript material collected in\r\nthe southern states; to the librarians and their assistants of the\r\nMassachusetts Historical Society, the New York Historical Society, the\r\nPennsylvania Historical Society, and the Maryland Historical Society,\r\nfor their many kindnesses; and to Professor Herbert L. Osgood, of\r\nColumbia University, for his advice and for the use of extracts from\r\nthe records of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign\r\nParts. The author’s most sincere thanks are due to Professor William R.\r\nShepherd, of Columbia University, under whose guidance this work has\r\nbeen carried on. His suggestions and criticisms have been invaluable,\r\nand he has given unsparingly of his time in reading both manuscript and\r\nproof.\r\n\r\n                                                      +Almon W.

Themselves+\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the use of Indians as slaves by the aborigines within\r\nthe present limits of the United States, both before and after the\r\ncoming of the Europeans, may be prefaced by the statement that the\r\ninstitution of slavery in some form was practically universal. Certain\r\ntribes held slaves more generally than others, and various tribes were\r\nmore subject to enslavement than others, according to their relative\r\nstrength and weakness.[1] Yet nowhere in the territory under discussion\r\ndid slavery exist on such an extensive scale that some tribes held\r\nothers in a state of subjection and demanded servile labor from them.\r\n\r\nSlavery among the tribes of the Great Plains and the Atlantic Slope\r\nwas different in nature from that in the northwest. Frequent mention\r\nof such slavery is found, but it has been shown that the term “slave”\r\nwas often used by the early Spanish and French writers in an erroneous\r\nsense as synonymous with “prisoner.”[2] The institution of adoption\r\nso largely used by the American Indians, and incident to intertribal\r\nwarfare and the consequent depletion of the tribal numbers, has also\r\nbeen confused by the writers with the institution of slavery.[3]\r\nThough slavery, in the strictest sense, was not general in the\r\nterritory above mentioned, yet some form of the institution is recorded\r\nas having existed among the leading tribes. In the discussion which\r\nfollows, the term “slave” must, then, be considered in its broadest\r\nsense. A prisoner held by his captor as an inferior and forced to labor\r\nfor him, or sold into servitude or freedom for the financial benefit\r\nof his captor, will be considered a slave when thus treated by the\r\nIndians, as he will be so considered in a later discussion when thus\r\ntreated by the whites.\r\n\r\nAmong the Aztec Indians of Mexico outcasts and criminals of the tribe\r\nwere enslaved,[4] and the usage appears to have been followed, to a\r\nvery slight extent, by Indians in the area of the French and English\r\ncolonies to the northward.[5]\r\n\r\nIndividual instances of slavery proceeded from other causes. The\r\nIndians were inveterate gamblers, and when nothing else was left, both\r\nmen and women not infrequently staked themselves to serve as slaves in\r\ncase of loss. Such slavery was sometimes for life, and sometimes for\r\nsuch short periods of time as a year or two.[6] In case of famine, the\r\nIndians even sold their children to obtain food.[7]\r\n\r\nThe slaves possessed by a given Indian tribe were oftener obtained\r\nthrough barter with other tribes. This intertribal traffic, though\r\nprobably not common, was evidently far-reaching.[8] Owing to the\r\nwandering habits of the Indians and their custom of bartering goods\r\nwith other tribes, articles of copper became distributed throughout\r\nthe Northwest, especially in Wisconsin. The Illinois Indians possessed\r\nslaves who came from the sea coast, probably Florida.[9] The Illinois\r\nalso bartered their slaves with the Ottawa for guns, powder, kettles\r\nand knives,[10] and with the Iroquois to obtain peace.[11] Marquette\r\nfound (1673) among the Arkansas Indians, knives, beads and hatchets\r\nwhich had been obtained partly from the Illinois and partly from the\r\nIndians farther to the east.[12] The Jesuit, Grelon, relates that in\r\nChinese Tartary he met a Huron woman whom he had known in America.[13]\r\n\r\nThe transition from the method of obtaining slaves by actual warfare\r\nand barter to that of mere slave raids was an easy one. The desire to\r\ngain the reputation of a skillful hunter, and, still more, of a brave\r\nwarrior, and thus to win the esteem and regard of his tribesmen, was\r\ninherent among the natives. To be a brave warrior was to be truly a\r\nman. So eager was the Indian to acquire the name of “brave” that he\r\nunhesitatingly underwent any hardships to obtain slaves or scalps as a\r\nproof of his qualifications for the title.[14] This means of obtaining\r\nslaves was used by the stronger tribes like the Illinois and the\r\nIroquois.[15]\r\n\r\nThe slaves bartered by the Illinois were generally taken in the\r\nterritory beyond the Mississippi.[16] This the Illinois were better\r\nable to do after the coming of the whites, as they were provided with\r\nguns, while the Indians to the westward had no weapons of the sort.\r\nOne of the chief sources from which these slaves was obtained was the\r\nPawnee nation. In 1719, Du Tisné wrote to Bienville, the commandant at\r\nNew Orleans, that the Pawnee were afraid of him when he arrived among\r\nthem, as their neighbors, the Osage, had made them believe that his\r\nintention was to entrap and enslave them.[17]\r\n\r\nThe same practice was followed by the other northern tribes. Le Jeune,\r\nin 1632, found slaves among the Algonquin. The Indians of the Great\r\nLakes region had a young Esquimaux as a slave in 1646.[18] Tonti found\r\nIroquois slaves among the Huron and Ottawa.[19] The Dutch navigator,\r\nHendrickson, in 1616, found the Indians of the Schuylkill River country\r\nholding Indian slaves.[20]\r\n\r\nOf all the northern Indians, the Iroquois were by far the most\r\npowerful. They were the enemies, in the time of the early French\r\nexplorations and settlements, of the Huron and the Illinois, and\r\nfrom these tribes they took many captives whom they enslaved. The\r\nstatement has been made that no personal slavery ever existed among the\r\nIroquois—that their captives were either killed or adopted as a part\r\nof the nation.[21] Quite the contrary is true. They held both Indians\r\nand whites in personal slavery. They brought back from the Ohio country\r\nbands of captives, sometimes numbering three or four hundred.[22]\r\nThey preyed upon the Shawnee and carried them off into slavery.[23]\r\nThey captured and enslaved the Miami for whose redemption they were\r\npresented with quantities of beaver skin. These they received but\r\nfailed to free the slaves.[24] They brought home slaves from Maryland\r\nand the south,[25] and from the land of the “Chat”[26] (the Erie). It\r\nwas the Iroquois (the Seneca), called by an early writer “Sonnagars,”\r\nwho enslaved captives taken from the tribes of Carolina and Florida.[27]\r\n\r\nSimilar practices are related of the southern Indians. The Virginia\r\ntribes possessed “people of a rank inferior to the commons, a sort of\r\nservants ... called black boys, attendant upon the gentry.”[28] When\r\nMenendez founded St. Augustine in 1565, he discovered in a native\r\nvillage the descendants of a band of Cuban Indians who had come to the\r\nmainland, been taken prisoners by the Florida Indians, and reduced to\r\nslavery.[29]\r\n\r\nIn the south the strongest tribes were the Choctaw and Chickasaw. These\r\ntwo tribes were not only at war with each other from time to time, but\r\neach preyed upon the weaker tribes of the surrounding country. In 1717,\r\na Cadodaquiou chief informed La Harpe, on his journey to the Nassoni\r\nnorthwest from Natchitoches, that the Chickasaw had killed and enslaved\r\ntheir nation until it was then very small, and that the remnant had\r\nbeen forced to take refuge among the Natchitoch and Nassoni.[30]\r\n\r\nThe Choctaw enslaved the Choccuma, a small tribe lying between them and\r\nthe Cherokee,[31] and about 1770 captured and burned their village. The\r\nchief and his warriors were slain, and the women and children became\r\nthe slaves of the conquerors.[32] The Pima of the present southern\r\nArizona took their slaves chiefly from the ranks of the Apache and\r\ntheir allies, and in some degree from the Yuma. These captives were\r\nlargely children. When not killed they were enslaved. Some of them\r\nwere kept within the tribe, and were even permitted to marry members\r\nof the tribe. But their origin was never forgotten, and the innate\r\nsuperstition of the natives found expression in the declaration of the\r\nmedicine men that disasters and misfortunes came to the tribe through\r\nthe presence of these aliens.[33]\r\n\r\nIn 1540, Mendoza stated that the Pueblo Indians kept their captives for\r\nfood and for slaves.[34] In the same year, Coronado, on his journey to\r\nCibola, found among the Indians he met an Indian slave who was a native\r\nof the country that Soto traversed.[35]\r\n\r\nWhen Du Tisné, in 1719, made his journey west of the Mississippi\r\nRiver, he found the Osage at peace with the Pawnee and at war with the\r\nKansas, Padouca, Aricara and other tribes, who in turn preyed on the\r\nPawnee.[36] The Pawnee were common prey to the tribes on both sides\r\nof the Mississippi River. Their nation was not especially small in\r\nnumbers,[37] but they appear to have been lacking in certain warlike\r\nqualities with which some other nations, as the Illinois and Iroquois,\r\nwere more generously endowed. On this account they were so generally\r\nenslaved by their enemies that the term “Pawnee” became synonymous\r\nwith Indian slave.[38] In 1724, de Bourgmont found the Kansas Indians\r\nemploying Padouca slaves.[39] De Boucherville, also, on his journey\r\nfrom the Illinois country to Canada, 1728–1729, took with him a little\r\nslave for the governor-general of Canada, and was offered other slaves\r\nas gifts by the Indians whom he encountered.[40]\r\n\r\nIn a letter written at Quebec, October 1, 1740, the Marquis de\r\nBeauharnois speaks of the Huron bringing slaves from the Flathead and\r\ndelivering them up to the Outaouac (Ottawa).[41] La Vérendrye, in 1741,\r\nwas told by the Horse Indians that the Snake Indians had destroyed\r\nseventeen of their villages, killed the warriors and women, and carried\r\noff the girls and children as slaves.[42]\r\n\r\nOf the Wisconsin tribes, the Ottawa and Sauk, at least, were in the\r\nhabit of making captives of the Pawnee,[43] Osage, Missouri, and even\r\nof the distant Mandan, whom they consigned to servitude. The Menominee\r\ndid not usually engage in these distant wars, but they, and probably\r\nother tribes, had Pawnee slaves whom they purchased of the Ottawa, Sauk\r\nand others who had captured them. For the sake of convenience, they\r\nwere called “Pawnees,” though some of them were certainly from the\r\nMissouri tribes. These captives were usually children.[44]\r\n\r\n“Beginning with the Tlingit, slavery as an institution,” using the term\r\nin its strictest sense, “existed among all the Northwest coast Indians\r\nas far as California. It practically ceased with southern Oregon,\r\nalthough the Hupa of Athapascan stock, and the Nozi (Yanan), both of\r\nnorthern California, practiced it to some extent.”[45] Slavery in some\r\nform appears to have existed among both the Klamath and the Modoc, and\r\nin the Columbia River district as far as the Wallawalla River, where it\r\nexisted among the Cayuse and the Nez Percés.[46] “The Northwest region,\r\nembracing the islands and coast occupied by the Tlingit and Haida, and\r\nthe Chimmesyan, Chinookan, Wakashan, and Salishan tribes, formed the\r\nstronghold of the institution.”[47] Toward the eastward the institution\r\nbecame modified, as has been shown.\r\n\r\nAccording as an Indian nation proved friendly or unfriendly, the whites\r\nused it for their own advantage. Originally the slaves consisted almost\r\nentirely of captives taken in war, for there was but little trade among\r\nthe different nations and tribes until articles of commerce were given\r\nby the whites in return for furs and slaves. How the traffic in slaves\r\nwas affected is seen in the case of the Choctaw and the Chickasaw,\r\nthe former friends of the French, the latter, of the English. The ill\r\nfeeling of the two nations was nourished by the international rivalry\r\nof their white allies to whom the Indians disposed of many of their\r\ncaptive slaves.[48] The Spaniards of Mexico made slave raids and\r\ninduced the Indians to do so. La Salle’s expedition, found abundant\r\nevidence in 1687 of Spanish trade among the Cenis Indians, in their\r\npossession of pieces of money, silver spoons, lace, clothes and a bull\r\nfrom Rome exempting the Spaniards in Mexico from fasting during the\r\nsummer.[49] Some messengers of the Chouman among the Cenis, and the\r\nCenis themselves, told the French of the slave raids and of the cruel\r\ntreatment of the Indians by the Spaniards to the southward.[50]\r\n\r\nEven the Jesuits were not averse to stirring up tribe against tribe.\r\nSo strong was their interest in the Huron that, for the advancement\r\nof the Jesuit cause, it was felt advisable to break up the Iroquois\r\npower. Even La Salle advised such a course of action, and urged that\r\nthe French strengthen the southern Indians by supplying them with\r\nfirearms and in other ways, so that they might be enabled to defeat the\r\nIroquois, destroy their organization, and carry off their women and\r\nchildren as slaves.[51]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, since the Huron were the friends of the French and\r\nhad been largely converted by the French missionaries, the Jesuits\r\nsought to better the lot of the Huron slaves held by the Iroquois,[52]\r\nand sent an earnest appeal to the Christians in France to contribute\r\nfunds for the redemption of the Christian captives.[53] Hennepin’s\r\n_Narrative_ tells of an attempt made by the Jesuits in 1681 to free\r\nsome Ottawa Indians who were slaves among the Iroquois, by gifts of\r\nwampum belts, and by telling the Iroquois that these Ottawa were the\r\nchildren of the governor of the French, and that by holding them they\r\nwere making war on the French.[54]\r\n\r\nThe employment to which the Indian slave was put by his Indian owner\r\ndepended largely upon the section in which the tribe resided. Their\r\nuse as domestic servants was probably common. Father Fremin tells of a\r\nyoung Iroquois woman who possessed more than twenty personal slaves,\r\nwhose duty it was to get wood, draw water, cook, and do all other\r\nservices which their mistress might direct. On the death of the owner\r\nwho was a Christian, her mother desired that the missionary instruct a\r\nsick slave in his religion, so that after death the slave might attend\r\nher former mistress in Heaven and perform the same services for her as\r\nshe had done on earth.[55] Among the Illinois, La Hontan found that two\r\nhours after sunset, the slaves covered the fires in the lodge before\r\ngoing to rest.[56] Bartram mentions a southern chief, who had attending\r\nhim as slaves many Yamasee captives who had been captured by him when\r\nyoung.[57]\r\n\r\nLe Jeune found the Huron and Ottawa Indian slaves engaged in minor\r\nhousehold duties.[58] In the northwest, enslaved women and children\r\nperformed the same labor.[59] One other use to which the young women\r\nand girls were put, if they did not marry into the tribe, was to serve\r\nas the mistresses of their owners.[60]\r\n\r\nAll the tribes east of the Mississippi River and south of the St.\r\nLawrence River and the Great Lakes practiced agriculture to some\r\nextent. They all raised corn, beans, squashes and melons.[61]\r\nConsequently the captive slaves worked in the fields with the members\r\nof the tribe, caring for the maize and vegetables. The Iroquois used\r\ntheir captives in tilling the fields.[62] Captain John Smith, in\r\nspeaking of Powhatan’s tribe, states that they made war, “not for lands\r\nand goods, but for women and children, whom they put not to death, but\r\nkept as captives, in which captivity they were made to do service.”[63]\r\nA part of this service consisted in caring for the crops. The Indians\r\nof North Carolina kept their slaves at work in the fields.[64] Soto\r\nfound that the Indians among whom he passed had many foreign slaves\r\nwhom they employed in tilling the ground.[65] Among the Illinois, La\r\nHontan found the women slaves employed in sowing and reaping.[66]\r\n\r\nSlaves were also employed in mining, hunting, fishing, and whatever\r\nmenial tasks needed to be done about the camp. But few of the tribes\r\nworked mines to any extent, yet Joutel, 1687, found the Cenis Indians\r\nworking slaves in their mines.[67] Hunting and fishing were more\r\nimportant occupations, since they furnished food for the tribe. Among\r\nthe Iroquois,[68] Huron,[69] Ottawa,[70] and Illinois,[71] such work\r\nwas partly done by the slaves who often worked with their masters. In\r\nthe northwest the slave assisted his master in paddling, fishing and\r\nhunting. He cut wood, carried water, aided in building houses, etc.[72]\r\n\r\nThe existence of barter or trade among the different tribes, and among\r\nindividuals of the same or different tribes, as a means of obtaining\r\nslaves has been already noted. Hence it follows that slaves, along\r\nwith wampum, furs, etc., served as a medium of exchange in trade.\r\nFurthermore, they served as gifts or objects of barter whereby captives\r\nbelonging to the possessor’s tribe might be obtained, and by which an\r\nunfriendly tribe or individual might be placated. They were given to\r\nthe whites to win their favor and friendship.[73] This use of slaves\r\nto purchase peace with a stronger tribe was noted by Tonti in the case\r\nof the Illinois and Iroquois. The Illinois were too weak to cope with\r\nthe Iroquois on a certain occasion owing to their young men being away\r\nat war, and so by the gift of beaver skins and slaves they were able to\r\narrange a peace.[74] Dubuisson, the French commander in the war of 1712\r\nbetween the French and allied Indians, and the Ottogami and Mascouten,\r\nrecords a similar use made of their slaves by the Indian allies of the\r\nFrench as a means of appeasing the Potawatami for an old quarrel.[75]\r\nFrom the area about Green Bay in the present State of Wisconsin, De\r\nLignery wrote in 1724 of bringing the warring tribes to an amicable\r\nsettlement through an interchange of slaves.[76] Other French\r\ncommanders in the same section used the same means to regain peace. Not\r\nonly to each other, but to whites as well, were slaves given in order\r\nto make reparation for losses in war. In 1684, the Indians offered Du\r\nLuth slaves to take the place of some assassinated Frenchmen.[77] In\r\n1724, the Indians at Detroit offered the French commander, by way of\r\ntruce, two slaves for the same purpose.[78] When slaves were desired\r\nfor such use, if the tribe possessed none, a raid was often made upon\r\nan enemy in order to obtain them. At the time of certain disturbances\r\naround Detroit, the Indians in the peace arrangements promised the\r\nFrench that they would make raids on distant nations to obtain slaves\r\nwhom they would deliver to the French allies to replace their dead.[79]\r\n\r\nThe treatment of slaves depended upon the individual owner, whose\r\ndisposition and mood might vary from kindliness to extreme cruelty\r\naccording to circumstances or caprice, and, still more largely,\r\nupon custom. In the northwest slavery had existed for a sufficient\r\nlength of time before the coming of the whites to modify materially\r\nthe habits and institutions of the people. It doubtless produced the\r\nideas of rank and caste so generally found among the Indians of that\r\nsection, but so little known elsewhere among the American Indians.[80]\r\nNevertheless the slaves among the Indians of the northwest were not,\r\nas a class, considered any more inferior to their owners than the\r\nslaves of the tribes farther east where adoption was more generally\r\npracticed. Consequently servitude in that section was of a rather\r\nmild type.[81] The same appears to have been true of servitude in\r\ngeneral among the Indians. Slaves were probably not generally neglected\r\nor abused.[82] Yet there are many testimonials of cruel treatment.\r\nTravelers spoke of the slaves of the southern Indians serving and\r\nwaiting on their masters with signs of the most abject fear, as tame,\r\nmild and tractable, without will or power to act but as directed by\r\ntheir masters.[83] The slave was expected to obey his master blindly\r\nand without disputing.[84] In this connection it must be understood\r\nthat enslavement of captives in war was in itself a kindly act on the\r\npart of the captors, determined partly by the need of laborers and\r\nadditional members in the tribe, partly by the use which the victors\r\ncould make of these captives in traffic with other tribes and with the\r\nwhites, and partly by mere whim. Otherwise, the prisoners were tortured\r\nand killed as an expression of hatred, or as a means of obtaining\r\nrevenge for injury. To instil fear into them, slaves were often\r\ncompelled to observe the torture of their fellow captives who were\r\ncondemned to death. La Salle relates an instance in which slaves were\r\nforced to eat one of their own nation, a victim of such torture.[85]\r\nAmong the Cenis such a custom was followed, and it is quite possible\r\nthat this method of producing subjection was consistent with the\r\nhabitual cruelty of most tribes.\r\n\r\nPrecautions were taken to prevent the escape of slaves. The southern\r\nIndians were accustomed to mutilate the feet of their slaves either by\r\ncutting away a part of the foot, or by cutting the nerves and sinews\r\njust above the ankle or instep. The slave was thus prevented from\r\nrunning rapidly, and if he should escape, the tracks of his mutilated\r\nfeet were easily recognizable.[86]\r\n\r\nThe life or death of Indian slaves depended upon either the council\r\nor the women.[87] The captives were apportioned by the council to\r\ndifferent individuals of the tribe, usually at the request of the\r\nwomen, who often preferred to adopt captives into their families to\r\nreplace lost husbands and sons, rather than to revenge themselves\r\nfor the loss of relatives by demanding the torture and death of the\r\nslaves.[88] After such distribution, the life or death of a slave\r\ndepended entirely upon the will of the owner. Among a barbarous people,\r\na slave’s life naturally had but little value. Sick and useless slaves\r\nwere often put to death,[89] and trivial faults might be punished in\r\nthe same way. The Jesuit missionaries said of the Iroquois: “When a\r\nbarbarian has split the head of his slave with a hatchet, he says, ‘It\r\nis a dead dog—there is nothing to be done but to cast it upon the dung\r\nhill’.”[90]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Jesuits record certain instances of kindness\r\nshown to slaves by the Iroquois and other tribes.[91] One important\r\ndifference existed between the Indian slavery as practiced by the\r\nIndians themselves, and that in existence among the whites. Among the\r\nIndians the question of social equality did not determine the relation\r\nof the slave to the master. The Indian slaves were always considered\r\neligible for adoption into the tribes as actual members, in order to\r\nreplete the numbers reduced by war, famine, disease or other cause.[92]\r\nAmong the Iroquois certain chosen slaves married into the tribe and\r\nbecame heads of families after the death of their owners. They led\r\na tolerably easy life, but were still considered as slaves, and had\r\nno voice, either active or passive, in the public councils.[93]\r\nStill others, who had been the richest and most important in their\r\nown villages, received no reward from their masters except food and\r\nclothing.[94] A certain amount of liberty seems to have been accorded\r\nthese slaves, for the Jesuits were allowed to work among them sometimes\r\nas openly as among the members of the tribe.[95] Bartram found that\r\namong the southern Indians the slaves were dressed better than their\r\nowners, and were allowed to marry among themselves; but they remained\r\nslaves for life.[96]\r\n\r\nThere were several ways by which Indian slaves could obtain their\r\nfreedom. Among the Huron a young brave could marry his mother’s slave,\r\nand his parents had no right to hinder him. By becoming his wife the\r\nslave became a free woman.[97] Among the southern Indians the children\r\nof slave parents were free and were considered in every respect equal\r\nto their parents’ masters.[98] Among the western Indians, upon the\r\ndeath of a savage, his slaves intermarried with others of their kind\r\nand lived in a separate hut as a sign that they were free since they\r\nhad no master to serve. The children of such marriages were adopted\r\ninto the tribe and became the children of the nation, since they were\r\nborn in the country and village of the tribe. The Indians believed\r\nthat the children should not be held as slaves since they “contributed\r\nnothing to their creation.”[99] In the northwest, the distinction\r\nbetween slave and free man was generally sharply drawn with regard to\r\nmarriage, for the slave usually could not marry the free man or woman,\r\nthough the Makah men frequently married slave women. The children of\r\nsuch marriages appear to have held “an equivocal position between free\r\nmen and slaves.”[100]\r\n\r\nThe most common mode of acquiring freedom was through adoption into\r\nthe tribes. Among the tribes of the Great Plains and the Atlantic\r\nSlope, adoption seems to have been universally practiced. The slaves\r\nadopted usually consisted of war captives,[101] who in some instances\r\nwere adopted wholesale, or who, after a period of servitude in the\r\ntribe, had proved themselves possessed of certain desirable qualities,\r\nsuch as bravery and strength in war or the chase. The adopted person\r\nbecame in every respect the peer of his fellow-tribesmen. If he showed\r\nhis ability he might become of high rank in the tribe. If he were a\r\npoor hunter, a poor provider, or, above all, if he turned out to be a\r\ncoward, he was despised and treated according to his demerits, probably\r\nworse than if he had been born a member of the tribe. Still, he was\r\na member of the tribe and remained a free man, though he was deposed\r\nfrom man’s estate and “made a woman.” Adopted persons who showed\r\nlittle ability, were sometimes made to serve in the families of the\r\ninfluential and prominent men of the tribe; but such persons were free,\r\neven though they performed menial labor.[102]\r\n\r\nIn some sections, a captive could not become a member of a tribe\r\nwithout a relationship of some sort; and to obtain this, he had to be\r\nadopted by a woman as her child.[103] The captive took the kinship\r\nname under the fiction that he was “younger” to every living person\r\nof the tribe at the time, and that all persons subsequently born were\r\n“younger” to him. If the captive belonged to a tribe of hereditary\r\nenemies who had from time immemorial been designated by opprobrious\r\nterms, such as cannibals, liars, snakes, etc., it might be that the\r\ncaptive was doomed to perpetual “younger brotherhood,” and could never\r\nexercise authority over any person within the tribe, though such person\r\nmight have been born after the adoption of the captive. Usually,\r\nthough not invariably, the captives adopted were children. They might\r\nultimately become useful members of the tribe, and by their virtues\r\neven win rank in kinship. A captive might thus pass from slavery to\r\nfreedom.[104]\r\n\r\nOccasionally the settlement of intertribal difficulties resulted in\r\nthe freeing of the captives by the victors, with permission to return\r\nto their former homes. Such freedom might be given to a whole tribe\r\nthat had been conquered,[105] or to single individuals. In either case\r\nthe stigma of disgrace attached to the condition of slavery still\r\nremained, and leaders of the tribe were preferably chosen from those\r\nwho had never been slaves.[106] Exchange or ransom was common. If a\r\ntribe declared war against another formally, which happened but rarely,\r\nslaves were sent with the notification of such fact to the enemy, and\r\nwere given their freedom if they promised not to take up arms against\r\ntheir former masters.[107] Freedom was given for performing certain\r\nservices against their masters’ enemies, such as influencing their own\r\ntribe against such enemies.[108]\r\n\r\nIn concluding this account of the institution of slavery among the\r\nIndians of the present United States it should be stated that no\r\nattempt has been made to treat the subject in detail. The purpose\r\nof the chapter is to show the existence of slavery and something of\r\nits nature, so as to obtain an historical setting for the discussion\r\nof the enslavement of the Indians by the whites which is to follow.\r\nRelatively few of the Indian tribes have been mentioned, but these\r\ncovered sufficient territory to show that the custom of slave-holding\r\nwas practically universal.[109] The familiarity of the Europeans who\r\ncame to America with the institution of slavery, and the finding of the\r\nsame custom among the Indians themselves, make their carrying on of the\r\npractice quite natural.[110]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                     +Enslavement by the Spaniards+\r\n\r\n\r\nIn their attitude toward the Indians the Spaniards simply applied the\r\ntheory of their time regarding slavery. The taking of slaves was then\r\nconsidered part of any expedition of discovery or conquest. The high\r\nauthority of the Church sanctioned the institution of slavery to the\r\nextent that the leading theologians had declared all barbarous and\r\ninfidel nations who shut their ears to the truths of Christianity, fair\r\nobjects of rapine, captivity and slavery.[111]\r\n\r\nThe general feeling regarding the relation of the Indians to the\r\nSpaniards is well expressed by Hernando de Escalante Fontanedo, who\r\nwas with Menendez in Florida as interpreter. In writing of Florida, he\r\ndeclared it his belief that the Indians “can never be made submissive\r\nand become Christians”; so he advocated that they all be taken, “placed\r\non ships, and scattered throughout the various islands, and even on the\r\nSpanish Main, where they might be sold as His Majesty sells his vessels\r\nto the grandees in Spain.”[112]\r\n\r\nGiven this attitude on the subject it was but natural that the\r\nenslavement of the American Indians should begin with the discovery of\r\nthe Antilles,[113] and that it should be continued by the explorers on\r\nthe mainland. The Spanish exploring expeditions were war expeditions\r\nin the sense that they aimed to conquer and retain for the crown the\r\nterritory through which they passed. All these expeditions captured and\r\nretained Indians as slaves. Yet in some cases it might be difficult to\r\ndetermine whether the Indians enslaved were captives taken in actual\r\nwarfare, or whether they were merely kidnapped by the expedition\r\npassing through their territory. Often the expeditions possessed the\r\ndouble character of a war party and a kidnapping company.\r\n\r\nThe enslavement of the Indians by the Spaniards in the early years of\r\noccupation was legalized by a royal decree which declared the act to\r\nbe in accord with the laws of God and man, and justified it on the\r\nground that Indians could otherwise not be reclaimed from idolatry\r\nand converted to Christianity. Consistent with its assertion the home\r\ngovernment made careful provision, in the various patents issued to the\r\nexplorers, for the spiritual welfare of the enslaved Indians.\r\n\r\nThese patents commonly made provision for the acquisition of Indian\r\nslaves. That of Ponce de Leon, February 23, 1512, authorizing his\r\nvoyage of discovery and colonization, provided that the Indians on the\r\nislands he might discover should be distributed among the members of\r\nthe expedition, that the discoverers should be well provided for in\r\nthe first allotment of slaves, and that they should “derive whatever\r\nadvantage might be secured thereby.”[114] The “cédula,” issued\r\nto Lucas Vasquez de Ayllon, in 1523, authorized him to “purchase\r\nprisoners of war held as slaves by the natives, to employ them on his\r\nfarms and export them as he saw fit, without the payment of any duty\r\nwhatever upon them; formal apportionment of the natives was expressly\r\nforbidden.[115] In the patent to Soto, also, it was required that\r\nhe should carry with him “the religious and priests, who shall be\r\nappointed by us, for the instruction of the natives of that province in\r\nour holy Catholic faith.”[116]\r\n\r\nThe idea of Christianizing the natives was applied to both free and\r\nslave Indians. The taking of captives by force, and then Christianizing\r\nthem was the continuation of what was known as “the exercise of a just\r\nand pious doctrine against pagans and heathens,” a doctrine common\r\nto other nations as well as to Spain. The patent of Ponce de Leon,\r\nhowever, made no provision for Christianizing the Indians.[117] His\r\ninstructions from the crown required him to summon the natives by\r\n“requisition” to embrace the Catholic faith and yield to the king of\r\nSpain under threat of sword and slavery.[118] Consequently the Spanish\r\nexplorers within the present limits of the United States continued the\r\npolicy of enslaving Indians pursued by their countrymen elsewhere in\r\nthe New World.\r\n\r\nA Spanish ship sailing under Esteban Gomez, a Portuguese, in 1525,\r\ncoasted along the shores of North America between Nova Scotia and\r\nFlorida, seeking the northwest passage, and carried a few Indians\r\nback to Spain.[119] In April, 1528, the expedition of Pánfilo de\r\nNarvaez landed near the entrance to Tampa Bay on the west coast of\r\nFlorida. From this point a portion of the expedition started into the\r\ninterior. The first Indians met seemed unfriendly, and five or six of\r\nthem were seized.[120] On one occasion, a cacique, or chief, was held\r\nprisoner.[121] But supplies failed and discouragement followed, so the\r\nnumber of Indians taken was not great. In 1538, also, an expedition\r\nsent out by Hernando de Soto brought two natives from Florida to Cuba,\r\nwhere they were held to learn the Spanish language in order that\r\nthey might act as guides and interpreters for the expedition of the\r\nfollowing year.[122]\r\n\r\nIn 1539, Soto himself landed in the Bay of Espiritu Santo in Florida\r\nfor the purpose of conquest. He had served under Pizarro in Peru, and\r\nhis methods were those learned from his master.[123] To insure success\r\nall opposition must be overcome, so, with the expedition were taken\r\nblood-hounds, chains and iron collars for the catching and holding\r\nof Indian slaves.[124] The expedition was military in nature, hence\r\nit was natural that force and conquest should precede conciliation.\r\nThere is no doubt that one of the purposes of Soto was to capture\r\nIndian slaves. He had chosen as his lieutenant, a rich resident of the\r\ntown of Trinidad in Cuba, Vasco Porcallo de Figueroa, who had come to\r\nFlorida with the object of obtaining Indian slaves for his estates. But\r\nslaves were not easily obtainable near the coast, so Porcallo returned\r\nhome shortly after.[125] Soto himself was a slave owner. Among his\r\npossessions in Cuba were Indian slaves, whom he employed as herdsmen\r\nand in getting gold. In some cases, the Indian chiefs through whose\r\nterritories Soto and his men were passing, furnished slaves. At other\r\ntimes, they, both men and women, were taken by force. Narrators relate\r\nthe capture and distribution of such women in groups of one hundred to\r\nthree hundred.[126] Among the captives were a queen and a cacique.[127]\r\n\r\nAfter the survivors of Soto’s expedition had reached Mexico, Viceroy\r\nMendoza dispatched the Franciscan, Fray Marcos de Niza, in 1539, to\r\ninform the native tribes that an effectual stop had been put to the\r\nenslavement of the Indians. Some of the friar’s party reached Hawaikuh,\r\nthe southernmost of the seven cities of Cibola. The account which the\r\nfriar gave on his return, induced the viceroy to send out another\r\nexpedition in the following year, 1540. The command of this was given\r\nto Francisco Vasquez de Coronado.[128]\r\n\r\nBut Coronado did not carry out the intention of Mendoza regarding the\r\nIndians. The records of his expedition do not indicate the number of\r\nhis slaves as equal to that in Soto’s expedition, yet Coronado was\r\na man of his time, and Mendoza was ultra humanitarian. When Tiguex\r\nwas conquered and plundered, March, 1541, Coronado imprisoned and\r\nmade servants of all the people, one hundred and fifty men, women and\r\nchildren who were in it.[129]\r\n\r\nStill other Spanish expeditions were nothing more than slave raids or\r\nkidnapping excursions. In 1520, Lucas Vasquez de Ayllon, a wealthy\r\nresident of Hispaniola, determined to send out a ship for the purpose\r\nof exploring the section north of that covered by Ponce de Leon in\r\n1513. His caravel met among the Bahamas a second ship sent out by\r\nanother resident of Hispaniola to obtain Indian slaves. The two vessels\r\njoined company, and proceeded toward the continent, which they reached\r\nJune 25, 1521, in the neighborhood of the River Jordan (the present\r\nSantee or Combahee) and the cape afterward called Cabo de Santa\r\nElena. By gifts and proffers of friendship, the Indians were lured\r\non board, and the ships, having obtained a full cargo, set sail for\r\nHispaniola.[130]\r\n\r\nAfter the collapse of Narvaez’s expedition, Cabeza de Vaca wandered\r\nthrough the southwest, hoping to reach Spanish settlements. As he\r\nproceeded, he met, thirty leagues from St. Miguel, a Spanish expedition\r\ncoming from the south, from which the Indians were fleeing lest they be\r\ncaptured and held as slaves. Though this slave hunting expedition met\r\nwith considerable success, its leaders, nevertheless, wished to enslave\r\nthe friendly Indians who had guided Cabeza de Vaca and his companions\r\nthither.[131] Cabeza de Vaca relates that he continued his journey to\r\nCompostella in the company, among others, of six Christians and five\r\nhundred Indian slaves.[132]\r\n\r\nSuch expeditions from Mexico were continued until well into the\r\ncolonial period. The Indians whom La Salle met, 1684–1688, told\r\nhim they knew whites toward the west, “a cruel, wicked nation, who\r\ndepopulated the country round them.”[133]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the custom of enslaving Indians was general among\r\nthe Spanish discoverers and explorers. Not to have followed such a\r\ncustom would have been acting contrary to the spirit of the times.\r\nChurch and State sanctioned it. The need for a servile class, and the\r\nsupply of natives near at hand to meet the demand, made enslavement\r\nonly a matter of course. Slavery existed among the native tribes\r\nthemselves and the tribal chiefs readily furthered the policy of the\r\nSpaniards by furnishing them with additional slaves and prisoners.\r\nConsequently, when the action of the Spaniards is viewed from the\r\nmoral standpoint of the time, no condemnation can be attached to their\r\npractice of enslaving the aborigines.\r\n\r\nSome of the Indians used by the Spanish explorers were obtained from\r\nthe Indian tribes through purchase or trade. Such a method of obtaining\r\nthem was advisable when the tribes were friendly and it was not politic\r\nto arouse their enmity. Prisoners and slaves, accordingly, both men\r\nand women, were traded or presented as gifts, along with other\r\nmerchandise, to the Spaniards.[134]\r\n\r\nIn all the exploring expeditions, the need of guides, interpreters,\r\ncamp laborers and burden bearers was imperative. At one time, Soto\r\npossessed eight hundred Indians, given him by an Indian chief, to\r\nact as porters.[135] The leaders must have some means of rewarding\r\nthe services of their soldiers. Gold and other desirable objects\r\nwere scarce. Indian slaves helped satisfy this need. Soto had the\r\nforesight, before setting out on his journey of exploration, to provide\r\nguides, consisting of Indian slaves seized in the territory which he\r\nexpected to traverse,[136] and seized others to act in this capacity\r\nas occasion required.[137] Slaves were used for the same purpose by\r\nCoronado.[138] The women slaves were used largely as cooks and as\r\nmistresses. Soto apportioned women slaves among his men.[139] The\r\nnarrators relate the capture and distribution of such women in groups\r\nof one hundred to three hundred.[140] Women were sometimes given by the\r\nchiefs to the white men for this purpose, as in the case of Coronado’s\r\nexpedition.[141]\r\n\r\nIn general, the treatment of slaves must have depended upon the\r\nindividual owners. It must be noted that it was held an act of\r\nclemency on the part of the victor to enslave rather than to slaughter\r\nthe captives taken in war, for, according to the ideas of the time,\r\nconquered enemies were at the disposal of the conquerors. In the\r\ncase of Soto’s expedition, the treatment of the slaves appears, on\r\nthe whole, to have been kind. After the death of Soto, the Spaniards\r\ndecided to quit the scene of exploration. The Indian slaves could not\r\nbe taken, for there was no way of transporting them, so it was decided\r\nto dismiss them, except about three hundred belonging to the leader\r\nMoscoso and some of his friends. To satisfy others who desired to take\r\ntheir Indians with them, Moscoso granted permission to take the slaves\r\nas far as the mouth of the river. The owners, moved by an humanitarian\r\nmotive, and preferring to give up the Indians before sailing, rather\r\nthan to free them at the mouth of the river to become the prey of\r\nenemies, set free five hundred men, women and children.[142] Many of\r\nthem had learned to speak Spanish, had become Christians, and were\r\nso attached to their Spanish owners that they wept bitterly at the\r\nseparation. This scene indicates an affection between master and slaves\r\nthat would exist only with kind treatment. It has been held that Soto’s\r\ntreatment of the Indians was probably better than that practiced by\r\nmost of the discoverers—a treatment at least partly dictated by policy,\r\nfor the Indians of the section traversed by him were superior to those\r\nof Central and South America, both in courage and perseverance.[143]\r\nThose Indians who continued the journey with the Spaniards were set\r\nfree by the viceroy on reaching Mexico.[144] In the siege of Tigeux\r\n\r\nCoronado’s men cared for those Indians who, in trying to escape, were\r\novercome by wounds and cold.[145] Special cases of cruelty occurred.\r\nStrict vigilance and severe punishment were necessary to prevent\r\ntreachery on the part of the slaves. The cruelty of the age was\r\nexpressed by throwing a lying and treacherous Indian to the dogs,[146]\r\nby cutting off the hands and noses of some,[147] and by keeping others\r\nin chains.[148] On the whole, however, the treatment of the slaves\r\nwas probably no more cruel than that shown slaves elsewhere, nor than\r\nwould be expected considering the tendency of the age, the nature of\r\nthe owners, largely soldiers and adventurers, and the incapacity and\r\ndisinclination of the natives for many kinds of labor.\r\n\r\nThe manumission of slaves depended partly on the individual owners,\r\npartly on the leaders of the various expeditions. An instance of the\r\nlatter kind we have already seen in the case of Moscoso freeing the\r\nslaves when quitting the scene of Soto’s expedition. But such an\r\nincident was the exception rather than the rule, for slaves were the\r\npersonal property of their individual owners, and subject to their\r\naction.\r\n\r\nBy the law of 1543, the Spanish government intended to end Indian\r\nslavery in its American dominions,[149] but the law was ineffectual.\r\nThe American possessions were too far removed for thorough control by\r\nthe home government. When Spain took final possession of Louisiana, in\r\n1769, O’Reilly discovered that the French held many Indian slaves,\r\nand in a proclamation, which he issued in 1770, declared this to be\r\n“contrary to the wise and pious laws of Spain.” While not at once\r\ndeclaring these Indian slaves to be free, he ordered that the actual\r\nproprietors should not dispose, in any manner whatever, of those whom\r\nthey held, unless it were to give them their freedom, until the orders\r\nof his Majesty on the subject should be received, and further, that all\r\nowners of Indian slaves should make a declaration of name and nation\r\nof the Indians so held in slavery by them, and the price at which they\r\nvalued such slaves. This proclamation was generally understood by the\r\nFrench settlers of upper Louisiana as emancipating all the Indian\r\nslaves; yet the latter remained in slavery, either voluntarily or\r\notherwise. They obtained some benefit from O’Reilly’s decree, however,\r\nfor when they escaped they were not returned to slavery, and when they\r\nsued for their freedom they received it. Thus, in 1786, Governor Miró,\r\nin a case that came before him from St. Louis, rendered a judgment\r\nthat liberated several such slaves. This judgment reminded Lieutenant\r\nGovernor Cruzat that the ordinance of O’Reilly was not being obeyed, so\r\nin June, 1787, he issued a proclamation that Indians could not be held\r\nin slavery under the ordinance of 1770, and declared that he “judged\r\nit expedient to repeat the aforesaid ordinance, so that the public\r\nmight know its tenor in order to conform to it.” Accordingly the said\r\nordinance was ordered to be read, published and posted in the customary\r\nplaces. No order on this subject was received from the king, so Baron\r\nCarondelet, 1794, ordered two Indian slaves to abide with their masters\r\nuntil the royal will was expressed. In the same year, however, he\r\nordered another Indian slave to be released.[150]\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that it was not through direct executive\r\ndecree that Indian slavery passed out of existence in Spanish territory\r\nwithin the present limits of the United States. In fact, from the\r\ninstance cited in connection with Louisiana, it is seen that it did not\r\npass out of existence until after the colonial period. Certain causes,\r\nhowever, contributed to its decline. Great number of Indians could be\r\nhired, at very small wages, to perform labor of any extent.[151] Still\r\nanother cause, which was less effective perhaps in Spanish territory\r\nthan in that of France and England, was the use of negro slaves. The\r\nlabor of the blacks was early found to be more profitable than that of\r\nthe Indians, and as early as the founding of St. Augustine, Menendez\r\nimported into Florida five hundred negro slaves. Otherwise, “the labor\r\nof building that town would have fallen on the white men, and on the\r\nIndians whom he could impress.”[152]\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest days of Spanish occupancy, the spiritual welfare of\r\nthe Indians was of much concern to the Spanish Church and State. The\r\nmaterialization of such an interest was largely accomplished by the\r\nestablishment of missions throughout the Spanish territory from Florida\r\nto California, chiefly through the labors of the Franciscans. The\r\nendeavors of the missionaries resulted in the establishment by 1615 of\r\ntwenty missions in Florida and the dependent coast region. By 1655, the\r\nChristian Indian population of northern Florida and the Georgia coast\r\nwas estimated at 26,000.[153] By 1630, there were more than 60,000\r\n“converts” in the Pueblo missions of New Mexico and Arizona.[154] In\r\nCalifornia, the missions, the first of which was founded at San Diego\r\nin 1769, continued in a fairly prosperous condition until 1834.[155]\r\n\r\nThese large numbers of barbarian neophytes were presided over in\r\neach of the missions by a very small number of monks who directed\r\nthe religious and industrial activities of their Indian charges. It\r\nwas necessary that a mission should be self-supporting. The Indians\r\ngathered at these centers voluntarily, and submitted to the routine\r\nlife of the missions. But the natives were ignorant and incapable, and\r\nthe monks were in consequence the directing and guiding force among a\r\npopulation which responded in a mechanical sort of way. The natural\r\nresult was that the mission life developed into a kind of slavery. The\r\nlife of a California mission, though of later date, and more fully\r\ndeveloped than the earlier missions of colonial times, affords a\r\npicture of the general condition of affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Indians constructed the buildings, planted and cultivated the fruit\r\ntrees and vineyards, tended the cattle, made pottery, wove cloths and\r\nperformed, in fact, all the manual labor that was necessarily required\r\nin an extensive colony. In return, they received food, clothing and\r\nlodging, were instructed in the Church doctrines and observances,\r\nand were taught dancing and music and occasionally the rudiments of\r\nreading, writing and arithmetic. Their life was a regular routine, and\r\nthough material comfort was generally in evidence, still the Indian\r\nneophytes were never allowed to act on their own initiative. Beyond\r\ntheir existence from day to day, they received no pecuniary reward for\r\ntheir labors, any more than if they had been slaves.[156]\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the missions were generally tractable, but occasionally\r\nthe desire for their former life of freedom brought reaction and\r\nrebellions; or, incited and aided by the wild tribes, they rose and\r\ndestroyed the missions. The revolt of the Pima in 1750 is a case in\r\npoint.[157]\r\n\r\nThe “alcaldes,” or local officials to whom the king had entrusted\r\nthe protection of the Indians, instead of protecting them, preyed\r\nupon them for their own profit. These men, like many of the colonists\r\nthemselves, were often of an inferior class, and too far from the\r\ncentral government to feel any special fear at disobeying the laws\r\nthat the home government might make with regard to the natives.\r\nAccordingly the Indians were often induced to run into debt, and had\r\nin consequence to mortgage or sell whatever property they possessed.\r\nThey thus became subject to whatever impositions the officials chose\r\nto put upon them.[158] In 1792, Fray Juan Agustin de Morfi complained\r\nto the viceroy of New Spain that from each pueblo in their respective\r\njurisdictions, the “alcaldes” in Texas were accustomed to levy weekly\r\ncontributions of produce; that they required the Indians to perform\r\nfree labor upon their estates; that they demanded heavy tolls from each\r\npueblo at harvest time; that the Indian women were forced to grind\r\nthe “alcaldes’” grain; that some officials required tithes of fleeces\r\nand compelled the Indians to weave them; and that the Indians had to\r\nserve as mule drivers and care for the animals of the “alcaldes.”[159]\r\nThe attitude of the “alcaldes” toward the Indians, furthermore, was\r\nrepeated by the officials of the “presidios,” or frontier posts.[160]\r\n\r\nThe same method of obtaining cheap labor was followed by the colonists.\r\nFrequent raids were made upon the “rancherías,” or Indian settlements,\r\nto secure agricultural workers, herdsmen and domestic servants.\r\nChildren were usually in demand, but adults also were taken. The\r\npractice continued, indeed, until late in the eighteenth century.[161]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                       +Enslavement by the French+\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the French colonies of America, Indian slavery was never authorized\r\nby legal declaration during the early colonial period.[162] In fact,\r\nthe matter received no attention whatever from the home government.\r\nSuch lack of notice on the part of the monarch was due to the\r\ninsignificance of American affairs in general, and to the unimportance\r\nof the institution of Indian slavery in particular. Gradually, however,\r\nas the matter began to assume importance in the system of trade,\r\nthrough the influence of the trading companies certain indirect royal\r\naction was taken in the eighteenth century, and this action recognized\r\nthe existing institution as legal. The modifications which the king\r\nsought to accomplish in it did not aim to destroy the institution, but\r\nrather tended to make it better suited to the requirements of trade.\r\n\r\nSome doubt appears to have existed regarding the legal status of Indian\r\nslaves, and, in order to remove it, Jacques Raudot, the intendant at\r\nQuebec, decreed in April, 1709, that “all the Pawnis and Negroes, who\r\nhave been bought and who shall be purchased hereafter, shall belong\r\nin full proprietorship to those who have purchased them as their\r\nslaves.”[163] The state of unrest caused by the “coureurs de bois”\r\nand others stirring up the tribes in order to take captives for sale\r\nto the French as slaves, interfered with the success of the trading\r\ncorporation then in possession of Louisiana, and on October 25, 1720,\r\nthe Company of the Indies issued a command from Paris, stating that\r\nsuch action was contrary to the command of the king, and harmful to\r\nboth the commercial welfare of the Company and the establishments\r\nwhich it hoped to make in the territory of the Illinois, Missouri and\r\nArkansas tribes. The Sieur de Bourgmont, in the service of the Company\r\nin that area, was directed to arrest and confiscate the merchandise\r\nof the “voyageurs” who should come to trade within the confines of\r\nhis jurisdiction without first obtaining permission and declaring to\r\nhim the motives with which they wished to trade. Bienville, then in\r\nimmediate charge of the colony in Louisiana, was directed to execute\r\nthis order of the Company at once, and all other officers as well were\r\nenjoined to carry it out and to give any aid and assistance to M. de\r\nBourgmont which he might require in fulfilling his instructions.[164]\r\n\r\nOn July 23, 1745, the royal council at Paris sanctioned the possession\r\nof Indian slaves by declaring that all slaves who might follow the\r\nenemy to the colonies of France, and their effects, should belong to\r\nhis most Christian Majesty.[165] After the acquisition of Canada the\r\nParliament of Great Britain showed itself favorable to the importation\r\nof slaves into the colonies. Accordingly, the forty-seventh article\r\nof the capitulation of September 8, 1760, provided: “The negroes and\r\nPawnees, of both sexes, shall remain in their quality of slaves, in\r\nthe possession of French and Canadians to whom they belong; they shall\r\nbe at liberty to keep them in their service in the colony, or to\r\nsell them; and they shall also continue to bring them up in the Roman\r\nreligion.”[166]\r\n\r\nPublic opinion in France never concerned itself with the matter of\r\nIndian slavery. There appears to have been no opposition to it,\r\neither in France or in the French colonies of America. Public opinion\r\nearly countenanced the institution of slavery in the colonies without\r\ndistinction of color or race.[167] It was negro slavery that brought\r\nprofit to the trader as well as to the colonist. The Indian slave in\r\nthe French colonies possessed no champion, such as the Indian slave in\r\nthe Spanish territory had in Las Casas. Within the French territory\r\nunder discussion, negro slavery continued, without meeting violent\r\nopposition, as long as the territory remained under French control. And\r\nwith it continued Indian slavery, gradually growing weaker as negro\r\nslavery grew stronger, and so less likely to attract attention.\r\n\r\nMuch of the French exploration was carried on by the missionaries.\r\nSlave holding was not inconsistent with the belief of these religious\r\ntravelers.[168] Two objects inspired their zeal: the “greater glory of\r\nGod,” and “the influence and credit of the order of Jesus,” of which\r\nmany of them were members.[169] To the missionaries about to start\r\nfrom Paris to explore the Ottawa country, the direction was given:\r\n“Remember it is Christ and the Cross you are seeking, and if you aim\r\nat anything else, you will get nothing but affliction for body and\r\nmind.”[170] The Jesuit held that if the object was good, the action was\r\nright. It would redound to the glory of God to convert any heathen,\r\nbond or free; therefore, slave holding by a monk was legitimate.\r\n\r\nThe records do not show any great numbers of slaves owned by the\r\nmissionary explorers. There are certain reasons why this was so.\r\nAbnegation of self was a part of the Jesuitic doctrine, so the monk\r\ncould have no need for any considerable number of personal attendants.\r\nHe possessed no mines or lands for the working of which slaves could\r\nbe used. What services the fathers could not perform in the extension\r\nof their faith, were performed partly by servants brought from France,\r\nand partly by “donnés,” or those who voluntarily gave their labor. At\r\nthe missions[171] and in the Indian villages where the missionaries\r\nstayed, the Indians rendered them free service and furnished them\r\nwith supplies. Then, too, the Indian domestic did not prove very\r\nsatisfactory.[172] The slave was a subject for conversion, but the\r\nFrench missionary did not spend much time on the conversion of single\r\nindividuals. He aimed rather to collect the heathen in groups about a\r\nreligious center, and to guide and teach them somewhat after the manner\r\nof his brethren in Paraguay. Yet we find that the French missionaries\r\npossessed some Indian slaves.[173] It would not do to refuse to save\r\nany soul, neither was it advisable to risk the chance of offending\r\nany Indian, whatever his rank, who might make them the gift of a\r\nslave. Most of the slaves held by the missionaries appear to have been\r\ngifts. Sometimes to accept such a slave was to save the person from\r\ndeath. Some of the slaves were purchased. By teaching them the French\r\nlanguage, and the principles of the Christian Church, the clergy hoped\r\nto make missionaries of some of them, and so extend the scope of their\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nThe chief, though not the earliest, source of Indian slaves among\r\nthe French was that of captives taken in war with the Indian tribes.\r\nFor many years after the coming of the French to Louisiana, they\r\nand the Natchez Indians lived in friendly intercourse. Minor Indian\r\ntroubles in 1711[174] and 1715[175] resulted in the enslavement and\r\ntransportation of certain Indians to Cape François on the island of\r\nHaiti. The hostilities begun with the Natchez Indians in 1715 continued\r\nintermittently until 1740.[176] In 1730, because of ill treatment by\r\nM. du Chapart, governor of Fort Rosalie, who wished the site of a\r\nNatchez village on which to build a town, and because of other abuses,\r\nthe Natchez rose against the French and massacred over two hundred of\r\nthem.[177] Governor Périer formed an army and advanced against them in\r\ntheir fort. The Natchez offered to leave the place if their lives were\r\nspared. Their offer was accepted, but they were detained as prisoners,\r\nall but twenty who escaped.[178] About four hundred and fifty of the\r\ntribe, including the Great Sun, the Little Sun and several of the\r\nprincipal war chiefs, were captured and carried to New Orleans.[179]\r\nThe women and children were retained as slaves on the plantations. Some\r\nof the prisoners were burned in New Orleans.[180] The Great Sun, the\r\nLittle Sun, their families, and more than four hundred of the captives,\r\nwere sent at once to Cape François, Haiti, and most of them sold to\r\nthe planters as slaves.[181] The two chiefs and their families were\r\nretained as prisoners on the island. On April 22, 1731, the minister\r\ninformed the Company that, in his opinion, the only solution of the\r\nmatter lay in selling as slaves the survivors of the two families. The\r\nregisters of the Company contain the following record: “It was resolved\r\nto order the sale of the survivors of the said two families of Natchez\r\nIndians.”[182]\r\n\r\nThe Natchez war was the most important of those between French and\r\nIndians in Louisiana. There were, however, minor difficulties, from\r\ntime to time, in which the same policy of enslaving the captive Indians\r\nwas followed by the French. The war with the Fox Indians, 1712, serves\r\nas an example of these lesser troubles.[183] By 1720, war had broken\r\nout between the French and the Chickasaw, whom the English had stirred\r\nup.[184] An intermittent warfare with this tribe and others continued\r\nin 1724,[185] 1728,[186] 1736,[187] (with a peace in 1740),[188]\r\n1750,[189] and 1752.[190] Captives were enslaved by both sides. Some\r\nof these were left with the Indians to dispose of at will. Others were\r\nkept among the French as slaves.[191]\r\n\r\nDuring the period of colonial history, each European nation was in\r\nalliance, from time to time, with various Indian tribes. In time of\r\nwar with other tribes, the allied Indians took an active part, and not\r\ninfrequently they were urged on to hostilities by their white friends\r\nfor various reasons. One of these reasons was to obtain war captives\r\nto give to the whites for slaves. In 1698, Tonti had encouraged the\r\nIllinois, who were in alliance with the French, to capture and enslave\r\nthe Iroquois Indians and so break their power.[192] La Salle favored\r\nthe same course.[193] In 1708, the Canadian French were exciting the\r\nIndians about Kaskaskia to wage war with each other, and were on\r\nthe spot to get slaves to sell to the English.[194] The Marquis de\r\nVaudreuil, governor-general of Canada, in 1706 demanded of the Ottawa\r\nof Detroit certain captives as slaves for the allied Sonnontouan to\r\nreplace their men slain by the Ottawa,[195] and others to be slaves\r\nto the French, in return for a missionary and a French deserter they\r\nhad killed.[196] The slaves were duly presented in 1707.[197] The\r\ndemands of the governor-general were part of a military plan to form\r\nan alliance of the western tribes with the French, and continued\r\nthe Indian custom of giving slaves to make reparation for injuries\r\ncommitted or for foes slain.[198] Thus the allied Indians were\r\nsatisfied, and a token of subjection was obtained from the Ottawa.[199]\r\nAs late as 1723, de Vaudreuil was accused of urging on the Abnaki\r\nagainst the Illinois to get slaves for him.[200] Apparently, such\r\naction was as agreeable to the Indians as to the French. An Indian\r\norator of the Arkansas tribe, in his address given in honor of Bossu’s\r\narrival in 1762, said: “We warriors will strike the common enemy to get\r\nprisoners which shall serve as slaves.”[201]\r\n\r\nSometimes the French went still further, and demanded that conquered\r\ntribes make war on other tribes in order to get captives for them to\r\ntake the place of Frenchmen killed during the war. Such a condition\r\nSieur de Louvigny placed on the conquered Fox Indians in 1716.[202]\r\n\r\nAs already observed, kidnapping was the means earliest adopted by\r\nall the European nations for taking Indians as slaves. In 1524,\r\naccordingly, Verrazano attempted to capture an Indian family consisting\r\nof an old woman, a young girl and six children, on the northeast coast\r\nof North America. But the girl proved so intractable that the soldiers\r\nwere forced to give up the attempt to take the whole family to the\r\nship, and finally carried away but one small boy who was too young to\r\nmake any resistance.[203] The purpose of Verrazano’s expedition was\r\nto obtain for France a place in the discoveries in which the rival\r\npowers, Spain, Portugal and England were engaged. Some proof that the\r\nexpedition reached the New World was desirable. A native would furnish\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn Cartier’s first expedition, 1534, he seized some of the natives\r\nand carried them on board his ships. The relations with the Indians\r\nwere so friendly that he was able, by gifts and explanations, to\r\npersuade them that he meant no harm. Two of them were finally detained\r\non board and carried to France.[204] On the second expedition, in\r\n1535, Cartier, replying to the request of the chief, Taiguragui, that\r\nthe French carry away another chief, Agona, declared that the king\r\nof France had forbidden him to bring back either man or woman, and\r\npermitted him to bring to France only two or three little boys to learn\r\nthe language.[205] But these pretended instructions did not prevent\r\nCartier from seizing Taiguragui and other chiefs for the purpose of\r\ncarrying them to France. On the outcry of the Indians against such an\r\nact, he promised that the chiefs should be well treated, and that after\r\nvisiting France for the purpose of telling the king about the land of\r\nSaguenay, they should be returned to their own country within the space\r\nof twelve months.[206]\r\n\r\nOn his setting out for the New World in 1562, the queen of France\r\ncommanded Ribaut to bring back some of the natives.[207] In obedience\r\nto her command, Ribaut attempted to detain two of the natives on board\r\nship to carry them to France, but the savages managed to escape and\r\nswam to shore.[208]\r\n\r\nSome of the Indians kidnapped by the explorers mentioned were slaves\r\nonly in a modified sense. They were not put to servile labor, yet\r\nthey were deprived of their liberty and were at the disposal of their\r\ncaptors. Some were held as objects of curiosity. Others were taken\r\nfor a definite purpose: to furnish information regarding their native\r\ncountry, and to serve as interpreters in later expeditions. For such\r\na reason La Harpe, in 1719, in his journey in the southwest, when\r\nreturning to the coast, resolved to capture some of the Indians, hoping\r\nthat by good treatment he might induce them to allow him to settle in\r\ntheir country and to carry out his plans. Under the pretence of landing\r\nto obtain water for his ships, he seized a dozen or more, and sailed\r\nfor Mobile.[209]\r\n\r\nThe Indians soon became suspicious of the explorers and traders,\r\nespecially in the sections where more than one of the rival races\r\ncarried on exploration and trade. Such a state of affairs Du Tisné\r\nfound in 1719, when he was badly received by the Pawnee whom the Osage\r\nhad told that his purpose was to entrap Indians for slaves.[210]\r\n\r\nThe great purpose of the French in the new world was trade. Their\r\nexpeditions, excluding those of the missionaries, were commercial in\r\nnature. With them gold hunting was not a primary consideration, as was\r\nthe case with the Spaniards, and that for the simple reason that no\r\ngold could be found. Nor were they seeking a refuge from persecution\r\nlike the English. The great fur trade was being developed by them.\r\nThis trade was carried on with the Indians, and in all sections where\r\ncaptives in war or kidnapped Indians were purchased from the natives,\r\nsuch purchase was usually a part of the trade in furs.\r\n\r\nThe custom of purchasing Indians originated with the early explorers\r\nand discoverers. Sometimes such a purchase was made for a purely\r\ncommercial reason: to obtain a slave to perform some certain labor. At\r\nother times the buyer was moved by an humanitarian motive: to save an\r\nIndian from torture or death at the hands of his captors. The purchased\r\nIndian might then be allowed to return to his own tribe and be retained\r\nas a slave at the will of his new master. In 1678, Du Lhut, when\r\nsetting out from Montreal on his travels westward, bought an Indian to\r\nact as a guide.[211] Du Tisné, in 1719, similarly acquired some slaves\r\nfrom a chief at Natchitoches.[212] In 1724, de Bourgmont purchased a\r\nconsiderable number of slaves from the Kansas tribe. Mention is made\r\nof fifteen at one time, six at another.[213] For these he was forced\r\nto pay double price, as the Indians stated that the year before, a\r\nFrenchman had given such a price to a party of Illinois who were with\r\nthem.[214] Sometimes the slaves obtained by these explorers and traders\r\nwere used in their own expeditions. At other times, they were sent back\r\nto the settlement along with other merchandise. De Bourgmont sent some\r\nof those whom he purchased back to New Orleans. La Vérendrye, also, in\r\n1731, sent back slaves to the French settlements, and in writing of his\r\naction implied that he thought he deserved much credit for furnishing\r\nthe colonists with slaves.[215]\r\n\r\nUntil well into the latter half of the eighteenth century Indian\r\nslaves were held by the settlers of Detroit, who obtained them in trade\r\nwith friendly Indians who in turn took them in war with the Pawnee,\r\nOsage, Choctaw and other western tribes.[216] In 1741, the so-called\r\n“Nation of the Serpent” entirely destroyed seventeen villages, killed\r\nall the men and older women, made slaves of the young women, and traded\r\nthem for horses and other merchandise.[217] A report to the home\r\ngovernment in 1720, concerning Natchitoches, declared that the most\r\nextensive commerce which could be carried on with the Indians of that\r\nsection, would be in slaves, horses, skins, etc.[218] Another report\r\nsent by La Salle told of the Alabama Indians bringing twenty-seven or\r\ntwenty-eight Mobile Indian women and children into the colony, and\r\ndisposing of them to the French.[219]\r\n\r\nThe friendly and allied Indians appreciated the results to be obtained\r\nfrom the sale of their captives to the whites, and not only sold\r\nthem to the “coureurs de bois” and other traveling traders, but took\r\nthem directly to the French settlement for sale, as is shown in the\r\npreceding paragraph. Apparently all the leading French settlements\r\nafforded a ready market for such slaves. Mobile furnishes a case in\r\npoint. In November, 1706, a party of Ouacha arrived in the settlement\r\nbringing some Abnaki captives for sale.[220] In the same month, also,\r\nsome Choctaw brought to the settlement Cahouita and Altamaha captives\r\nfor the same purpose.[221]\r\n\r\nIt was the Jesuit and French missionaries who first advocated the\r\npurchase of Indian captives by the traders, in order to prevent\r\ntheir being put to death. By putting them in a mild condition of\r\nservitude they hoped to place them in a position where they would be\r\nChristianized.[222] Both Tonti[223] and La Salle[224] advised such a\r\ncourse of action.\r\n\r\nThe colonists favored the same action for a more commercial reason.\r\nThe French of Kaskaskia, in 1708, were urging the allied Indians to\r\nwar, and were on the spot to obtain captives to sell as slaves to the\r\nEnglish.[225] De Vaudreuil, governor-general of Canada, throughout the\r\nfirst quarter of the eighteenth century was urging the Abnaki to wage\r\nwar on the Illinois to obtain slaves for him.[226]\r\n\r\nAn important factor in the French colonial trade was the “coureurs de\r\nbois.” These men, having cut loose from civilization, wandered at will\r\namong the Indians, trading for the various commodities which they could\r\ndispose of in the settlements of either the French or English colonies.\r\nOne of these commodities was Indian slaves, obtained for the most\r\npart from the tribes who had captured them in war. Judging from the\r\nnumber of these white men of the woods, their unrestrained life, and\r\nthe evidence given by the men of the time, it seems not unlikely that\r\nthis feature of colonial trade produced a considerable portion of the\r\nIndian slaves used by the French.[227] If the “coureurs de bois” did\r\nnot find a sufficient number of slaves among the tribes they visited,\r\nthey not infrequently stirred up the tribes to war, so that they might\r\nobtain the captives for sale. On July 25, 1707, La Salle wrote from\r\nFort Louis to the Minister of Marine that the “coureurs de bois” from\r\nCanada were thus stirring up the Indian tribes against each other, in\r\norder to obtain Indian slaves to sell in Louisiana.[228] The work of\r\nthe “coureurs de bois” was, however, by no means limited to Louisiana,\r\nbut extended over all the area claimed by the French. The desire of\r\nthe English for Indian slaves afforded an opportunity for profit that\r\ncould not be rejected. They always found a ready market for their\r\nIndian slaves with the English of the Carolina country. The control of\r\nthe French officials over this wandering class was always slight, and\r\nsince there was practically no export trade in Indians to be had in\r\nLouisiana, and since all the Indians whom they obtained could not be\r\ndisposed of in the colony, they turned to the English colonies for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nSome effort was made by the French officials to prevent this trade,\r\nbut the attempt met with indifferent success. It was not the traffic\r\nin human beings which disturbed them, but the fact that their enemy,\r\nthe English, were profiting by the transaction. In 1714, a report\r\nof Cadillac to the home government lamented both his inability to\r\nrestrain the French allied Indians from trading with the English in\r\nslaves and other commodities, and also his embarrassment at not being\r\nable to prevent the French colonists from trading with the English\r\nin skins and Indian slaves.[229] Such opposition, however, was not\r\ngeneral among the French colonial officials. Some of the most prominent\r\nones were engaged in this same slave trade with the English, even\r\nwhen appearing to be opposed to it. In 1708, Bienville ordered the\r\nCanadian French to cease exciting the Indians of Kaskaskia to wage war\r\non each other to obtain slaves for them.[230] Yet, in the same year,\r\nhe proposed, since the French would not cultivate the land, to obtain\r\nthe needful supply of labor by seizing Indians and sending them to the\r\nWest Indies in exchange for negroes.[231] And in his report to the\r\nhome government mentioned above, Cadillac complained of the selling\r\nof Indian slaves to the English by Bienville.[232] Such transactions\r\nby the French officials were carried on secretly. The Sieur de Ste.\r\nHeleine, nephew of Bienville, was killed by the English allied\r\nIndians while on such an expedition to sell Indians to the English of\r\nCarolina.[233]\r\n\r\nSome opposition to the trade was shown by the Jesuits, since the hoped\r\nfor result of having numbers of slaves to convert, if purchased by the\r\nFrench, did not materialize. Accordingly, in 1693, they petitioned the\r\ngovernor of Canada to prohibit the trade in Indian slaves. The request\r\nwas granted and an order issued to that effect, but without definite\r\nresult. The “coureurs de bois” continued the trade in spite of the\r\npenalty of fine and imprisonment.[234]\r\n\r\nCertain of the Indians possessed by the explorers were gifts from\r\nIndian chiefs. On his second voyage, in 1535, the chiefs of the\r\nSaguenay River country gave Cartier three children.[235] Afterwards,\r\nowing to mutual suspicions on the part of the French and Indians, one\r\nof these children made her escape.[236] On the resumption of good\r\nfeeling, the Indians promised to return her. Later, another chief\r\noffered Cartier two children, one of whom was accepted.[237]\r\n\r\nIn 1564, Laudonnière led an expedition to the region of Florida.\r\nDesiring to penetrate into the interior and realizing that the\r\nfriendship of the Indians was necessary for such an attempt, he sought\r\nto obtain from an Indian chief two of his prisoners, whom he proposed\r\nto use in winning the friendship of another chief by presenting them\r\nto him.[238] At first, the chief declined to give away the prisoners;\r\nbut, upon Laudonnière’s renewing his request, the chief yielded, the\r\nprisoners were produced, and were taken back by the French to Fort\r\nCarolina.[239]\r\n\r\nChamplain desired to send to France some girls to have them\r\n“instructed in the law of God and good manners.” An opportunity to\r\nsatisfy this desire came with the wish of the Montagnais to present\r\nsomething to the French traveler. Three girls were given him, whom he\r\nnamed Faith, Hope and Charity, and whom he had instructed in religion,\r\ndomestic work, etc.[240] Still other Indians were taken to France by\r\nthe expedition. One of the sagamores of the Montagnais gave his son to\r\nM. du Pont for that purpose. Still another savage, an Iroquois woman,\r\nthe Frenchman begged of the tribe which was about to eat her.[241]\r\nOther and similar instances of obtaining Indians are recorded for the\r\nsame general humanitarian and religious purpose.[242]\r\n\r\nThe Illinois gave Marquette and Jolliet an Indian slave boy, whom\r\nJolliet took with him when going to Quebec, and who was drowned on\r\nthe journey.[243] The Ottawa gave Marquette a young man,[244] and\r\na Kishkakon chief gave him “a little slave he had brought from the\r\nIllinois a few months before.”[245] In the same manner, Indians\r\nwere given to La Salle and to his companion, Tonti, on their\r\nexpeditions.[246] In 1699, Father Anastasius accepted from the Indians\r\nthe gift of an Indian girl as a slave.[247] In 1703, M. de Saint Cosmé,\r\na missionary priest traveling from Canada to Natchez, possessed in his\r\nparty a young Indian slave boy.[248]\r\n\r\nWhen Du Lhut was in Montreal in 1678, the savages gave him three\r\nslaves.[249] At another time, 1684, the Indians wished to give him some\r\nslaves as an atonement for their having murdered some Frenchmen.[250]\r\nIn 1700, the “Mantantons” (Mdewakanton), at a feast in his honor,\r\npresented Le Sueur, among other gifts, with an Indian slave.[251] In\r\n1719, La Harpe, on his journey northwest from Natchitoches, was given a\r\nyoung Kansas slave by the chiefs of several nations gathered together.\r\nOne of the chiefs expressed his sorrow that he had but one slave to\r\ngive, and La Harpe, in his letter to Terrisse, regrets that he did not\r\narrive sooner, and by receiving them as slaves, prevent the seventeen\r\ncompanions of his slave from being eaten.[252]\r\n\r\nThe Indians realized that the trade in captive slaves was profitable.\r\nWhen, in 1724, the Kansas tribe charged de Bourgmont double price\r\nfor slaves sold him, they feared that he would be angry at the price\r\nasked, and that in consequence they would lose future trade. So they\r\npresented him with five slaves as a gift.[253]\r\n\r\nThroughout history the children of slave mothers have generally been\r\nconsidered slaves. A report on the condition of Louisiana, 1716,\r\ndeclared that the inhabitants were accustomed to sell the children\r\nof their Indian female slaves.[254] Later, in 1724, a royal decree\r\nprovided that children born of marriages between slaves should be\r\nslaves, and should belong to the masters of their mothers, and not to\r\nthe masters of their fathers, if father and mother should belong to\r\ndifferent masters.[255]\r\n\r\nThe uses to which Indian slaves were put, either in early or later\r\ncolonial times, were determined by economic conditions. Among the\r\nexplorers, the need for guides and interpreters was imperative, and\r\none finds the French, like the Spanish, using Indian slaves for this\r\npurpose. On his second expedition, Cartier made such use of the Indian\r\nchildren whom he carried to France on his first expedition.[256]\r\nLaudonnière, in 1564, intended to use slaves for this purpose.[257] Du\r\nLhut purchased a slave to act as guide.[258] The Mallet expedition, in\r\n1739, used a slave as guide.[259] One of the slaves purchased by de\r\nBourgmont on his expedition in 1724, was retained with the expedition\r\nas interpreter, and was taught French by de Bourgmont himself.[260]\r\nDoubtless the instances might be multiplied if the records were\r\ncomplete, though it is not likely that enslaved Indians were used for\r\nthis purpose to the same extent as the friendly allied or converted\r\nIndians.[261]\r\n\r\nThe French never sent out any great expeditions like those of the\r\nSpaniards. Hence among the explorers the use of slaves as domestics\r\nwas limited. Among the colonists, one finds Le Page du Pratz, on\r\nhis arrival in Louisiana, buying an Indian woman to act as cook and\r\ninterpreter.[262] The early Louisiana colonists experienced the need\r\nfor servants, and, May 26, 1700, expressed the hope that the Indians\r\nwould supply such need.[263] The life of the Illinois colonist was less\r\nluxurious than that of the inhabitant of Louisiana; in consequence, the\r\nneed of slaves in household service was less.\r\n\r\nEarly in the eighteenth century life among the French of Louisiana,\r\nboth rich and poor, was quite licentious,[264] and one of the means of\r\nfostering this life was the use of Indian women, slave and free. The\r\ndemoralization resulting from such a condition attracted attention,\r\nand in 1709 it was urged that girls suitable for wives be sent over in\r\norder “to prevent these disorders and debaucheries.”[265]\r\n\r\nAgricultural pursuits appear to have been the chief labor to which the\r\nFrench put Indian slaves. Such pursuits, along with trading, formed the\r\nchief industry of the colonies.[266] But it was the general tendency\r\nof the French to prefer the novelty and excitement of the trader’s\r\nlife, rather than the more quiet existence of the agriculturalist.\r\nBienville complained much of this state of affairs, and sought to\r\nremedy it.[267] The consequence of this tendency was to make the price\r\nof labor high,[268] and the use of Indian slaves was a means at hand\r\nto solve the difficulty. In the simpler life of the inhabitants of the\r\nIllinois country, agriculture was the chief industry of the settlers\r\nuntil the close of the period under discussion.[269] And the farmers\r\nincreased the results of their industry by the extensive use of Indian\r\nslaves.[270]\r\n\r\nThroughout the French territory in the military stations, both soldiers\r\nand frontiersmen found use for their Indian women slaves as cooks and\r\nin performing the other domestic labors of fort and camp.[271] The male\r\nslaves were used in erecting fortifications, performing other heavy\r\nlabor, and as guides in military expeditions.[272]\r\n\r\nThe custom of using Indian slaves as a bribe or reward was common. In\r\neither case the purpose of the whites was the same: to procure the\r\nfriendship and alliance of the tribes. In the northwest the French\r\ndemanded that certain subdued tribes bring them Indian slaves, which\r\nthey might use to replace the members of the allied tribes whom the\r\nconquered tribes had killed during the war.[273] In the area where\r\nthe claims of the European nations overlapped, alliance of the tribes\r\nwas especially desired by each nation. These Indian captive slaves\r\nor slaves purchased from other tribes were often returned to their\r\nown tribes as a peace offering or as a token of friendship. Thus the\r\nalliance of the tribes was won, and a barrier created against the\r\nencroachments of the Spanish and the English.[274] Such use was made\r\nof slaves by de Bourgmont, in 1724, in the Kansas country. With a\r\nmessenger sent from there to the Comanche, he sent also two Comanche\r\nslaves whom he purchased from the Kansas in order that his messenger be\r\nwell received.[275] He also purchased some Padouca slaves in order to\r\nreturn them to their people.[276]\r\n\r\nIn 1728, the king of France issued an edict regarding certain\r\nconcessions of land, and required a tax of five livres on each slave,\r\nthe proceeds of which were to be used in building churches and\r\nhospitals.[277] Thus the Indian slaves, along with the negroes, served\r\nas a property basis in this one instance, as they did many times in the\r\nEnglish colonies. They were also regarded as property in all legal and\r\nbusiness transactions and were classed along with negroes, domestic\r\nanimals and real estate, which could be sold to satisfy their owners’\r\ndebts.[278]\r\n\r\nThe early slavery among the French was mild in nature.[279] The system\r\nwas of a patriarchal type. The Indian slaves often worked along with\r\ntheir owners, especially those engaged in agricultural labor, and were\r\ntreated as children who must be guided, directed, punished or rewarded\r\nby their superiors. Cramoisy, writing of Bienville’s expedition of\r\n1737, states that a Chickasaw slave who acted as guide, had belonged to\r\nhis owner five years and was always treated as one of the family.[280]\r\nA French settler in the Fox Valley is spoken of as living with his\r\nPawnee slaves in feudal style.[281]\r\n\r\nThe relation of the French and the Indians, bond or free, was always\r\ndifferent from that existing between the English and the Indians. The\r\nFrenchman never looked upon the Indians with the disdain and contempt\r\nfor an inferior race which was displayed by the English. Marriage\r\nbetween French and Indians was common. The social result of this close\r\nconnection was more pronounced in case of the Frenchman than in that\r\nof the Indian. It meant the “Indianizing” of the Frenchman, or the\r\nbringing him to the social level and to the life and habits of the red\r\nman. The most striking result of this tendency was supplied by the\r\n“coureur de bois;” but the same result was apparent even in the case\r\nof the superior colonists of lower Louisiana. And to this result the\r\nIndian slave contributed in a measure. The lack of social distinction\r\nbetween Frenchman and native tended toward kind treatment on the part\r\nof the owner, and to a shifting of the social planes of master and\r\nslave toward that of equality. Yet instances of cruelty to slaves\r\nare not lacking. The punishments of the age were cruel, whether the\r\noffender was bond or free.[282]\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the dominating feature of French colonial life\r\nwas trade. But religious and commercial advancement went hand in hand.\r\nFrom the earliest arrival of the French, the missionary labors of the\r\nChurch extended not only to the Indian tribes, but also to the negro\r\nand Indian slaves held by the colonists. The conversion of the Indian\r\nwas an asset for the growth of trade. French commissions, as well as\r\nSpanish, provided for the conversion of the Indians.[283] Priest and\r\nfriar were everywhere present. Each Christianized Indian slave marked\r\na gain in the advancement of the faith, and made possible a readier\r\naccess to trade with the convert’s tribe and those of his friends.[284]\r\nBut the religious training and teaching of slaves were not entirely a\r\nmatter of policy. It was rather a part of the generally kind treatment\r\nof the master. The rites of the Church were commonly accorded them.\r\nThe Louisiana church records certain accounts of the birth, baptism,\r\nmarriage and burial of Indian slaves.[285] The Mobile and New Orleans\r\nregisters are similar to the church registers to be found throughout\r\nLower Canada wherever a church was established. The parish registers of\r\nLevis, Quebec and Long Point are cases in point. Throughout the first\r\nand part of the second half of the eighteenth century, these registers\r\nshow that Indian slaves, many of whom, in Quebec for instance, were\r\nbrought from Louisiana, were baptized, and then records kept of such\r\nbaptisms as in the case of the whites.[286] The church records of\r\nKaskaskia[287] and Vincennes[288] make frequent mention of the birth,\r\nbaptism and death of Indian slaves (called Panis) down to the time\r\nof British occupation; but from that time they became more and more\r\ninfrequent as Indian slavery gradually gave way to negro slavery.\r\nThe baptismal register of Mobile, Alabama, dating from 1704 to 1740,\r\ncontains baptismal records of whites, blacks and Indians. From the\r\nregister it appears that witnesses to the baptism of a slave were not\r\nconsidered necessary, though sometimes used. In some instances the\r\nperson baptized is recorded as the slave of a certain person. In other\r\ncases he is mentioned as a slave, and the owner’s name is not given.\r\nThe earliest baptism of an Indian slave in this record is that of a\r\nfifteen-year-old slave of Iberville. Baptisms of Indian slaves are\r\nquite as frequent as those of negro slaves. February 8, 1734, is the\r\nlatest date of Indian slave baptisms in the register. Some of these\r\nIndian slaves are recorded as legitimate children of slave parents.[289]\r\n\r\nThe laws of France did not permit the holding of any Christian in\r\nslavery. This meant that the conversion of Indians or other slaves\r\nwould confer freedom upon them.[290] But the law was never enforced.\r\nThe French clergy went on continuously with their work of converting,\r\nbaptizing and teaching both bond and free; and in the “Code Noir” of\r\n1724, Louis XV commanded that all slaves in the French colonies, “be\r\neducated in the Apostolic Roman Catholic religion, and be baptized,”\r\nand enjoined their owners to have these matters attended to within a\r\nreasonable time.[291] The code dealt directly with negro slaves, but\r\nthe Indian slaves still in existence were necessarily included in its\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nIn Louisiana Indian slavery began with the founding of the colony. A\r\nreport of the colony written in 1704, states that at Fort Louis de\r\nLouisiane, having a white population of 180 soldiers and 27 French\r\nfamilies numbering 64 persons, (a total of 244 white persons), there\r\nwere six Indian boy slaves from twelve to eighteen years of age, and\r\nfive Indian girl slaves from fifteen to twenty years of age.[292] In\r\n1708, the colony consisted of fourteen officers, seventy-six soldiers,\r\nthirteen sailors, three priests, six mechanics, one Indian interpreter,\r\ntwenty-four laborers, twenty-eight women, twenty-five children, (a\r\ntotal of 190 free persons), and eighty Indian slaves.[293] In 1713,\r\nbesides the soldiers, there were twenty-eight families, twenty negroes\r\nand a few Indian women and children.[294] The following statistics are\r\ngiven in the archives of the Ministry of the Colonies in Paris:[295]\r\n\r\nCensus of New Orleans, November 24, 1721. Recapitulation: Men, 446;\r\nWomen, 140; Children, 96; Negro slaves 523; Indian slaves, 51.\r\n\r\nCensus of New Orleans in 1723. Recapitulation: Men, bearing arms, 229;\r\nWomen or girls, 169; Children, 183; Orphans, 45; Slaves, 267.\r\n\r\nGeneral census of the Colony of Louisiana on January 1, 1726.\r\nRecapitulation: Masters, 1952; Hired men and servants, 276; Negro\r\nslaves, 1540; Indian slaves, 229.\r\n\r\nGeneral census of the Department of New Orleans on July 1, 1727.\r\nRecapitulation:\r\n\r\n                                   _Masters_ _Hired_ _Negroes_ _Savage_\r\nNew Orleans                            729      65      127       17\r\nThe Bayou and Chantilly                 42       5       73        5\r\nInhabitants up the River on the Right  243      26      883       45\r\nIdem on the Left                       306      35      456        5\r\nOn the Shore of Lake Ponchartrain        7       2       14\r\nOn Bayou Tauchpao                        2       5        8        1\r\n                                      ————     ———     ————       ——\r\n    Total                             1329     138     1561       73\r\n\r\nFrom these statistics it will be seen that in Louisiana the negro\r\nslaves far outnumbered the Indian slaves, and that the ratio of the\r\nnumber of Indian slaves to the number of whites in the colony was very\r\nsmall. A memoir concerning Natchitoches, 1720 or 1721, states that the\r\nnumber of black slaves in that settlement was thirty-four, and the\r\nnumber of Indian slaves, six (two men and four women).[296] A report\r\non the condition of Louisiana at large in 1744 declared that there\r\nwere very few Indian slaves in the colony, “because we are at peace\r\nwith all nations: these we have were taken in former wars, and we keep\r\nthem.”[297] Another account, in 1750, states that the inhabitants\r\nof New Orleans consist of “French, Negroes, and some savages who\r\nare slaves—all these together do not number ... more than 1,200\r\npersons.”[298]\r\n\r\nThe smallness of the number of Indian slaves in Louisiana appears due\r\nto several reasons: the generally friendly relations of the French and\r\nthe neighboring tribes; the absence of extensive agriculture at an\r\nearly date; the neglect of the colonial authorities to develop a trade\r\nin savage slaves, like that of Carolina; and the rapid increase in the\r\nimportation of negro slaves by the time that occupations profitable for\r\nslave labor were developed.\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of the Mississippi Valley, also, Indian slavery\r\nbegan with the coming of the whites. Slavery at Vincennes and in the\r\ncountry below the present site of Terre Haute, Indiana, was regulated\r\nby the laws of Louisiana. That in the country to the north was\r\nregulated by the customs of Canada. Indian slavery in Canada began\r\nearly. Record exists of Indian slaves in Montreal in 1670.[299] In\r\nLouisiana the greater number of slaves were negroes; whereas in Canada\r\nthe larger portion were Indians.[300] In the early history of Vincennes\r\nmost of the slaves were Indians, for the inhabitants were more\r\nextensively engaged in the Indian trade than in agricultural pursuits.\r\nThe same was true of the country about Detroit. Some of these Indians\r\nwent, of course, to Louisiana; but the larger portion went to Canada. A\r\nreport in 1750 shows that in the five French villages of the Illinois\r\ncountry there were eleven hundred whites, three hundred blacks and\r\nsixty Indian slaves.[301] Indian slavery, already giving way to negro\r\nslavery, continued so to do after British occupation.\r\n\r\nIndian slaves, mostly children, are recorded in Detroit in 1710,[302]\r\n1712,[303] and 1715.[304] Their use continued there until the English\r\noccupation. A report in 1733 shows the Canadians trading in Indian\r\nslaves whom they seized or purchased from other Indians.[305] By the\r\nterms of the surrender of Montreal, 1760, already mentioned, the\r\nEnglish guaranteed to the settlers all the rights in property they had\r\nenjoyed, and Article IV of the capitulation provided that all negro and\r\nPawnee slaves should remain in their condition of servitude.[306] In\r\n1763, the population of Canada comprised about 70,000 Europeans, 30,000\r\nIndians and 400 black slaves.[307] It will be seen that the number of\r\nnegro slaves was very small as compared with the number in Louisiana.\r\nAnd, judging from the frequent mention of Indian slaves in the parish\r\nrecords,[308] and the not inconsiderable trade in such slaves that went\r\non with the western tribes, one may concede the truth of the assertion\r\nthat the number of Indian slaves in that territory, under Canadian law,\r\nexceeded the number of negro slaves, even though, in proportion to the\r\nwhite population, the number was small.\r\n\r\nIn the French colonies, the earliest method of manumission was to grant\r\nslaves their freedom verbally and without further formality. In the\r\nWisconsin country, during the first half of the eighteenth century,\r\nat least, there appears to have been some requirement or obligation,\r\nperhaps imposed by custom, for the owners of Indian slaves to free\r\nthem after a certain period of servitude.[309] But on April 11, 1735,\r\na memorandum of the king to de Beauharnois and Hocquart declared that\r\nthe judges of the colonies might conform themselves to the custom of\r\nconsidering the Indians held in servitude as slaves, and that masters\r\nwho might wish to grant such Indians their freedom should do so by\r\nnotarial deed.[310] Accordingly, on September 1, 1736, an ordinance was\r\nissued at Quebec by Hocquart, the intendant, stating, with the consent\r\nof the Marquis de Beauharnois, governor and lieutenant-general of the\r\ncolony, that anyone wishing to free any slave must make affirmation to\r\nthat effect before a notary, to which he would be held. The act would\r\nbe registered in the “greffe” of the nearest royal jurisdiction. A\r\nmanumission performed in any other way was declared null and void.[311]\r\n\r\nAs above stated, it was customary for the French colonists to sell the\r\nchildren of their female slaves.[312] The practice might, and did, mean\r\nthat a father sold his own child. Notice of the matter having been\r\ncalled to the attention of the king, an attempt was made to prevent\r\nthe practice by inserting in the instructions sent to the colony in\r\n1721–1722, a provision forbidding the sale of either a female negro or\r\nIndian slave or her child, if a free colonist were the father of such\r\na child. The same instructions further declared it in harmony with\r\nreligion and the welfare of the colony that at the end of a certain\r\nperiod of time both mother and child should be given their liberty, and\r\nso be made free inhabitants of the colony.[313] Such a kindly attitude\r\non the part of the home government met with but little response in the\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nSeveral causes contributed to the passing of Indian slavery in French\r\nterritory. Wherever the American Indians have been brought into contact\r\nwith the white races, the result has been disaster to the red men.\r\nThe Indian’s nature is not adapted to the white man’s scheme of life.\r\nThe Indian absorbed the white man’s diseases and vices. Not the least\r\nof these vices was the love for strong drink, and the weakness of the\r\nnatives in this respect was recognized and encouraged by the traders\r\nof all nations. The decrease in game and other food supplies as the\r\nIndians retreated from the sea,[314] famine followed by gluttonous\r\nexcesses, wasting of the forests of the table lands,[315] all resulted\r\nin inferior living conditions and a consequent decrease in the birth\r\nrate and weakening of the tribes. As the weakened tribes withdrew from\r\ncontact with the whites they usually joined with stronger tribes. The\r\nremoval of tribes from their immediate neighborhood, and the union with\r\nother and distant tribes, acted as a check on the whites’ obtaining\r\nIndians as slaves. Such was the case with the tribes from whom the\r\nFrench of the Illinois country and Canada drew their slaves.[316]\r\n\r\nIt has already been seen that the French missionaries of early colonial\r\ndays believed that the enslavement of Indians would serve as a means of\r\nspreading the Christian religion. They found, however, that the method\r\nof obtaining Indian slaves by trade only increased the distribution\r\nof spirituous liquors among the tribes; and so, in 1693, they asked\r\nthe king to prohibit the Indian slave trade. An order to this effect\r\nwas accordingly issued, but with little result. The “coureurs de bois”\r\nfound means to carry on the trade clandestinely notwithstanding the\r\npenalty attached.[317] Again, in 1736, the king decided formally\r\nto prohibit the enslavement of Indians and issued a decree to that\r\neffect;[318] but to no advantage.[319]\r\n\r\nThe gradual passing out of existence of Indian slavery, furthermore,\r\nwas due, in no small measure, to its unsatisfactory character. The\r\nleading colonists early made up their minds to this effect. Bienville,\r\nin a letter to the Minister of Marine, July 28, 1706, stated that the\r\nFrench colonists earnestly requested negroes to till their lands, for\r\nwhom they were willing to pay silver, since the colonies found Indian\r\nslaves unsatisfactory. He furthermore requested permission for the\r\ncolonists to transport Indian slaves to the West Indian Islands in\r\nexchange for negroes. The fact that the colonists were willing to trade\r\nthree Indians for two negroes is sufficient proof of the small value of\r\nIndians as slaves.[320] Another letter to the home government, in 1717,\r\nrecords the same state of affairs in the colony.[321]\r\n\r\nIndian slaves were prone to run away, and their use by the French as\r\nindividual laborers, or their use only in small groups, if worked\r\ntogether, made escape comparatively easy. A letter of Périer to the\r\nhome government, May 12, 1728, declared that the traffic in Indian\r\nslaves and their use in the French colony was contrary to the welfare\r\nof the country, since such slaves served but a short time before\r\nthey escaped back to their own tribes or to neighboring Indians.\r\nMoreover, these deserting Indians persuaded the negro slaves to run\r\naway with them.[322] A letter from the President of the Navy Board\r\nto la Jonquière and Bigot, May 4, 1749, represented that the Indian\r\nslaves brought up in the colony by the officers or by the inhabitants,\r\ngenerally left them when they attained a certain age and again became\r\nuncivilized; that they were the more dangerous on account of the\r\nknowledge which they had acquired of the country, being better able\r\nthan others to make incursions therein; and that through the habit of\r\nkeeping these slaves the whites were dissuaded from becoming domestic\r\nservants.[323]\r\n\r\nAmong the slaves the boys were not so much to be depended upon as the\r\ngirls, since they were stubborn, resented more strongly their being\r\nheld in slavery, and were more inclined to run away. Long’s Journal,\r\n1768–1782, speaking of the western Indians, records: “They are also\r\nfull of pride and resentment, and will not hesitate to kill their\r\nmasters in order to gratify their revenge for a supposed injury. The\r\ngirls are more docile, and assimilate much sooner into the manners of\r\ncivilization.”[324] It is probable that slaves coming from the Pawnee\r\ntribe, and held so largely by the French of Detroit and Canada, were\r\nmore satisfactory than those coming from other tribes.[325] It has been\r\nsaid that “it would be difficult to find another of the wild tribes of\r\nthe continent capable of subjection to domestic slavery.”[326] But the\r\nPawnee, like other slaves, ran away.[327]\r\n\r\nThough Indian slaves were not as profitable laborers as might be\r\ndesired, their loss was to be avoided, if possible. The matter was so\r\nserious as to interest the action of the authorities, and in 1709,\r\nJacques Raudot, intendant of Canada, issued an ordinance containing\r\nan injunction which forbade any slave running away, and containing\r\nprovisions for imposing a fine of fifty livres on those who aided such\r\nrunaways.[328]\r\n\r\nIndian slaves were too few in number and too inferior in capacity for\r\nlabor to supply the needs of the colonists. So an attempt was made\r\nby the home government to supply the needed laborers by establishing\r\nthe system of indentured servants in the colonies. On November 16,\r\n1716, an ordinance directed that vessels leaving France for any of\r\nthe king’s American colonies were to carry thither, if of fifty tons,\r\nthree servants; of sixty to one hundred tons, four servants; of one\r\nhundred tons and upward, six servants. The period of service of such\r\nservants was fixed at three years. They were required to be of sound\r\nbody, between the ages of eighteen and forty, and in height not under\r\nfour feet. These servants were to be examined before the officers of\r\nthe admiralty to see if they fulfilled the requirements of the law,\r\nand were to receive another examination by the commissary on landing\r\nin America. Such of the redemptioners as the captain might not sell\r\nwere to be given to some of the planters who had none, and who were to\r\npay their passage. The ordinance was repeated May 20, 1721, with the\r\nadditional provision that merchants of the ports having permission to\r\ntrade with the colonies were to pay sixty livres for each redemptioner\r\nwhom they had to furnish, if individuals for that purpose were not\r\nfurnished them by the government.[329]\r\n\r\nThe purpose of France, in making such careful provision for sending\r\nindentured servants to the New World, was a real effort to increase\r\nthe population and, therefore, the trade of America.[330] Moreover,\r\nthe home government feared the danger that might come to the colony\r\nby the increase of the black over the white population, and hoped\r\nthis indentured servant system would be a means to that end. But the\r\nscheme had little result. The colonists preferred black slaves to white\r\nservants. Their term of service was for life instead of a short period.\r\nThey were easier to control, cheaper to keep, and were better workers.\r\nYet, it has been estimated that from 1711 to 1728, two thousand five\r\nhundred redemptioners were brought to the French colonies.[331] Such\r\na number of white servants must, in a measure, have checked the\r\nacquisition of Indian slaves.\r\n\r\nBut the need for laborers was to be supplied in the French colonies by\r\nthe black, instead of the white race. Although the home government grew\r\nto fear the result of the rapid increase of the negro element, yet, at\r\nfirst, it favored the importation of blacks to the American colonies.\r\nIn 1688, Louis XIV issued an edict authorizing the importation of\r\nnegroes from Africa into America.[332] Article XIV of the letters\r\npatent granted by the king to Crozat, September 30, 1712, gave the\r\nlatter permission, if he found it advisable to have the blacks in\r\nLouisiana, to send a ship every year to the coast of Guinea to obtain\r\nthem, and to sell them to the inhabitants of the colony.[333] So,\r\nfrom the first, negro slaves were present in the French colonies,\r\nthough during the earlier part of the eighteenth century, they were\r\noutnumbered by the Indian slaves.[334]\r\n\r\nIn 1713, there were but twenty negro slaves in Louisiana,[335] but\r\nwith the granting of the charter of the Western Company in 1717, their\r\nincreased importation began. A provision of the charter required that\r\nduring the lifetime of the charter (twenty-five years,) not less than\r\nthree thousand negroes be carried to the colony. The first large\r\nimportation was made by the Company in June, 1719, when five hundred\r\nnegroes were brought from the coast of Guinea.[336] For several\r\nyears, the importation of negroes into Louisiana was one of the most\r\nprofitable monopolies of the Western Company.[337] One authority states\r\nthat, during the period from 1717 to 1723, one thousand, four hundred\r\nand forty-one negroes were brought in.[338] Another states that from\r\n1717 to 1728 eighteen were introduced.[339] The “Code Noir” of 1724\r\nshows that the negro slaves had become the majority by that time, for\r\nno direct mention is made in it to Indian slaves.[340] In 1727, it\r\nwas reported that on each of the “concessions,” or leading grants,\r\nthere were, at least, sixty negroes cultivating corn, rice, indigo and\r\ntobacco.[341]\r\n\r\nTo open up and work the mineral resources of Louisiana, Philip François\r\nRenault was sent out by the Company of the West in 1719. On his way,\r\nhe bought at San Domingo, in the name of his Company, five hundred\r\nnegroes for working the mines. These negroes were taken into the\r\nIllinois country.[342] The number of negroes in the Illinois country\r\nnever equaled that of the country farther south, yet in 1750, a Jesuit\r\nmissionary found one thousand, one hundred whites, three hundred\r\nblacks, and sixty Indian slaves in five villages of the Illinois\r\ncountry,[343] and by 1763, the black population numbered over nine\r\nhundred.[344]\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing account it will be seen that the steadily increasing\r\nnumber of negro slaves, resulting from a promotion of the commercial\r\ninterests of the home government and from the more satisfactory labor\r\nperformed by the blacks, must have been the leading cause that produced\r\nthe steady decrease in the number of Indian slaves among the French.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PART II\r\n\r\n                   THE INSTITUTION AS PRACTICED BY THE\r\n                                 ENGLISH\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                      +The Number of Indian Slaves+\r\n\r\n\r\nTo arrive at any knowledge of the exact number of Indian slaves in\r\nany of the English colonies is impossible. Census reports and other\r\nvital statistics are infrequent or lacking, especially in the early\r\ncolonial period; and often in such statistics as are extant Indian\r\nslaves either receive no mention, or are classed with negro slaves\r\nwithout distinction. From existing records, however, one is able to\r\nobtain a knowledge of the comparative numbers in the different groups\r\nof colonies, and to some extent in the individual colonies, during\r\nthe colonial period. New England and the southern colonies were the\r\nsections that employed Indian slave labor most extensively, the south\r\ntaking precedence, for climatic conditions there were more favorable,\r\nand economic conditions made necessary a larger quantity of servile\r\nlabor than was required in the north.[345] Yet New England made use of\r\nthe natives as slaves as long as they lasted,[346] and drew further\r\nsupplies from Maine,[347] the Carolinas,[348] and other districts.[349]\r\n\r\nAmong the English colonies, the Carolinas stood first in the use of\r\nIndians as slaves. Such use began with the founding of the colony.\r\nThe need for laborers was great; the source of supply was near at\r\nhand and the colonists availed themselves of their opportunity.\r\nProbably captives of the Stono War became the Indian slaves mentioned\r\nin the inventory of Captain Valentine Byrd, “one of the grandees of\r\nthe time.”[350] In a report on conditions in the colony, made to the\r\nproprietors, September 17, 1708, by Governor Nathaniel Johnson and his\r\ncouncil, the number of Indian men slaves was given as 500, Indian women\r\nslaves, as 600, Indian children slaves, as 300, a total of 1400 Indian\r\nslaves. The number of negroes at the same time was stated as 4100, of\r\nindentured servants, 120, and of free whites, 3960. The governor gave\r\nthe cause of the rapid increase in the number of the Indian slaves\r\nduring the five preceding years, as “our late conquest over the French\r\nand Spanish, and the success of our forces against the Appalaskys and\r\nin other Indian engagements.”[351]\r\n\r\nOnly a small portion of the whole number of Indians enslaved were kept\r\nin the colony.[352] Yet, in 1708, it was estimated that the native\r\npopulation furnished one-fourth of the whole number of slaves in South\r\nCarolina.[353] The public records of that colony contain a list of\r\nninety-eight Indian slaves with their owners’ names, taken by the\r\nSpaniards and their allies in 1715, during the Indian war, and carried\r\nto St. Augustine. The number of these slaves belonging to individual\r\npersons varied from one to ten.[354] A report of 1723 mentions the\r\nnumber of slaves in South Carolina and Georgia as ranging from 16,000\r\nto 20,000, “chiefly negroes and a few Indians.”[355] Another report of\r\nthe following year estimates the number of slaves as 32,000, “mostly\r\nnegroes”,[356] In 1728, the population of St. Thomas’ parish, South\r\nCarolina, consisted of 565 whites, 950 negro slaves, and 60 Indian\r\nslaves.[357] From these statistics, it will be seen that the number of\r\nIndian slaves was much smaller than the number of negroes, and that it\r\nwas growing smaller toward the middle of the eighteenth century, while\r\nthat of negroes was constantly increasing.\r\n\r\nThe early history of Indian slavery in Georgia is so bound up with that\r\nof Carolina, the Indian wars, and the difficulties with the Spaniards\r\nof Florida, as to require but little especial attention. After the\r\nsettlement of Georgia as a separate colony, occasional mention is\r\nmade of Indian slaves.[358] In 1759, as the basis for a tax bill, the\r\nnumber of slaves was placed at 2500, but a committee of the legislature\r\ndeclared the number to have been underestimated. How many of this\r\nnumber were Indians is not known. The colony was settled at a time when\r\nIndian slavery was passing out of existence. So it is safe to state\r\nthat the number of such slaves was small.\r\n\r\nThe number of Indian slaves in Virginia, also, was small, owing largely\r\nto the number of indentured servants, and to the early introduction and\r\nfitness of the negroes for the labor of the colony. In 1671, Berkeley\r\nreported the whole population of the colony as 40,000, the number of\r\nindentured servants as 6000, and that of slaves as 2000.[359] But no\r\ndivision of slaves according to color was made. In certain sections\r\nbut few slaves were used. The Scotch-Irish and the Germans preferred\r\ntheir own labor to that of slaves. Some Indians were taken in war, but\r\nthey were inconsiderable when compared with the number captured in the\r\nCarolinas. Occasional mention of Indian slaves is found well into the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\nIndian slavery in Massachusetts began early. Following the Pequot War,\r\n1637, forty-eight captives were retained as slaves in the colony.[360]\r\nAfter King Philip’s War, 1675, also, certain of the captives were made\r\nslaves,[361] but no record exists of the exact number. The various\r\nrecords and histories of the Massachusetts towns show a general\r\ndistribution of Indian slaves throughout the colony during the colonial\r\nperiod, such as existed following the two Indian wars above noted.\r\nMere mention may be made of some of these: Plymouth,[362] Boston,[363]\r\nRoxbury,[364] Ipswich,[365] Quincy,[366] Charleston,[367] Malden,[368]\r\nHaverhill,[369] Milton.[370] None of the official reports on the\r\ncondition of New England makes mention of Indian slaves.[371] But\r\nstatistics show the number of slaves in Massachusetts in 1720 to have\r\nbeen 2000, including a few Indians.[372] In 1790, according to the\r\nUnited States census report, the number of slaves in the state was\r\n6,001, which number included about 200 half breed Indians.[373] Since\r\nMassachusetts took the lead in the two Indian wars of New England, it\r\nseems likely that the number of Indian slaves in that colony exceeded\r\nthat in either Connecticut or Rhode Island.[374]\r\n\r\nThe Rhode Island laws from 1636 to 1704 make no mention of Indian\r\nslaves. Yet they were held in the colony before 1704. The records of\r\nBlock Island show them there in sufficient numbers, in 1675, to warrant\r\nthe town council regulating their action. Captives taken in King\r\nPhilip’s War were retained in the colony temporarily as slaves. The\r\nBoston newspapers occasionally mention runaway Indian slaves of Block\r\nIsland.[375] Both negro and Indian slavery reached a development in\r\ncolonial Narragansett unusual in the northern colonies.[376] In 1730,\r\nSouth Kingston had a population of 935 whites, 333 negroes and 223\r\nIndian slaves. Eighteen years later, the proportion of races was nearly\r\nthe same: 1405 whites, 380 negroes, and 193 Indians.[377] As late as\r\n1778, the laws of Rhode Island mentioned Indian slaves.[378]\r\n\r\nIndian slavery in Connecticut began almost with the founding of the\r\ncolony, and came about as a result of the Pequot War (1636). The\r\ncaptives taken in the war were assigned directly to the colony and\r\nwere retained and distributed among the inhabitants.[379] The colonists\r\nappear to have held a greater number of such slaves then than at\r\nany later period. Certain Indians, also, were kept in the colony as\r\nslaves following King Philip’s War, but the number is unknown.[380]\r\nLocal histories show them in different towns well into the eighteenth\r\ncentury.[381] An answer sent to a query from the Board of Trade in\r\n1680 states that there were then thirty slaves in Connecticut, but no\r\nmention is made of Indian slaves though they existed in the colony.[382]\r\n\r\nThe number of Indian slaves in New Hampshire was undoubtedly very\r\nsmall. During the Pequot War and King Philip’s War, New Hampshire\r\nremained at peace with the Indians, and the statement has been made\r\nthat no New Hampshire merchant or captain, during the Indian wars,\r\nkidnapped natives or consciously broke faith with them.[383] The close\r\nconnection with Massachusetts, however, made inevitable the existence\r\nof Indian slaves in the former colony,[384] and the Boston newspapers\r\noccasionally mention such slaves as late as approximately 1750.[385]\r\n\r\nIn the middle group of colonies, the number of Indian slaves was never\r\nlarge, and, in comparison with that in either the southern or New\r\nEngland groups, it was conspicuously small. There appear to have been\r\nmore of such slaves in New York than in any other colony of the group,\r\na condition due to its greater trade with the colonies which exported\r\nthem. The English colony, furthermore, took over no Indian slaves from\r\nits Dutch predecessor.[386]\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of New York, under Dutch or English rule, never waged\r\nany war on the order of those in New England against the Indian tribes.\r\nNor did the distribution of New England captives affect this colony\r\nto any great extent. A few Indian slaves were introduced from foreign\r\nparts, but the selling and holding of Indians as slaves was never a\r\ngeneral custom.[387] The existence of Indian slaves, however, was\r\nrecognized by a decree of the governor and council in 1680.[388] An\r\nIndian slave was sold, July 30, 1687, in Hempstead, Long Island.[389]\r\nThe narrative of grievances against Jacob Leisler includes the\r\nfollowing: “The same night, December 23, 1689, an Indian slave,\r\nbelonging to Philip French, was dragged to the Fort (New York), and\r\nthere imprisoned.”[390] Aaron Schuyler of New York, 1693, gave to each\r\nof his two daughters, in his will, an Indian slave woman.[391] In July,\r\n1703, the governor received a petition regarding an Indian slave.[392]\r\nThe will of William Smith, of the manor of St. George, Suffolk County,\r\nApril 23, 1704, divided a number of negro and Indian slaves among his\r\nchildren.[393] In 1715, certain Indians complained that the whites\r\nwere enslaving native children entrusted to them for instruction.[394]\r\nIn 1724, the Reverend Mr. Jenney reported: “There are a few negro and\r\nIndian slaves in my parish.”[395] On July 3, 1726, the Reverend Mr.\r\nVesey of New York, in a letter to the Society for the Propagation of\r\nthe Gospel in Foreign Parts, stated that in the colony there were\r\n“about one thousand and four hundred Indian and negro slaves,”[396] but\r\ntells nothing about the proportion of each. Colonel Johnson’s letter to\r\nGovernor Clinton, January 22, 1750,[397] and William Johnson’s letter\r\nto G. W. Banyar, June 28, 1771,[398] the former relating to Indian\r\nchildren held as slaves, and the latter mentioning a Pawnee Indian\r\nslave in New York, show the existence of such slaves until a late date.\r\nOccasional mention is found in the newspapers of the time of runaway\r\nIndian slaves.[399] From the evidence the conclusion is that although\r\nthe existence of Indian slavery was continuous in New York throughout\r\nthe colonial period, the number of Indian slaves, in comparison with\r\nthat of individual colonies in New England and the south, was small.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn, speaking of his purpose in founding a colony in America\r\nsaid: “I went thither to lay the foundation of a free colony for all\r\nmankind.” Yet in Pennsylvania existed the indentured servant, the\r\nnegro slave and the Indian slave. Considering the attitude and the\r\nrelations of Penn and his followers toward the red men one would hardly\r\nexpect to find the Indians enslaved. In the absence of wars with the\r\nnatives,[400] no Indian captives were reduced to servitude. The Indian\r\nslaves used were brought from other colonies. The newspapers contain\r\naccounts of their being bought and sold, and of their running away,\r\nas in the other colonies.[401] The leading men of the colony owned\r\nthem. Penn’s own deputy, Governor William Markham, owned one, born in\r\n1700, who, by the terms of Markham’s will, was to be freed at the age\r\nof twenty-five.[402] In a bill of sale of the personal effects of Sir\r\nWilliam Keith, dated May 26, 1726, an Indian woman and her son were\r\nmentioned among the seventeen slaves listed.[403]\r\n\r\nIn 1780, a farmer of East Nottingham, Chester County, registered, at\r\nthe county seat, the names of an Indian girl, aged twenty-four years, a\r\nslave for life, and of an Indian man in slavery until he arrived at the\r\nage of thirty-one years.[404] The action of the Friends’ Yearly Meeting\r\nin 1719, also, shows that Indian slaves, as well as negro slaves, were\r\nowned by the members of that religious society.[405]\r\n\r\nIt has been said that slavery in New Jersey was more prevalent among\r\nthe Dutch settlements and the plantations of South Jersey than in\r\nthe Calvinistic towns of East Jersey.[406] Since the number of negro\r\nslaves throughout the Dutch possessions of America was considerable,\r\nit may be concluded that the scarcity of Indian slaves was due to\r\nconditions rather than to scruples, though the presence of a Quaker\r\nelement may have affected the situation. The proximity of the powerful\r\nIroquois, also, by shutting off the source of possible supply, may\r\nhave had something to do with the matter. The number of Indian slaves\r\nin New Jersey was very small, yet the newspapers of the time show the\r\npresence of such a servile class in the colony throughout the colonial\r\nperiod.[407]\r\n\r\nIn Maryland, there appears to have been even a smaller number of\r\nIndian slaves than in New Jersey. There were no Indian wars to furnish\r\ncaptives,[408] and the Indians from the Carolinas were sent to ports\r\nin New England where the demand for them was greater. In Maryland\r\nindentured servants largely supplied the need for laborers and so\r\nminimized the use of the natives as slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                   +Processes of Enslavement: Warfare+\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the processes in vogue among the English for the acquisition of\r\nIndian slaves, the most productive was that of warfare.[409] With the\r\nexception of the Pequot War and King Philip’s War in New England, the\r\nIndian wars in the English colonies were confined to the south, and\r\nthere the greatest number of Indian war captives were enslaved.\r\n\r\nAfter the Indian massacre of 1622 in Virginia, there was published\r\nin London, in the same year, a tract entitled: “_The Relation of the\r\nBarbarous Massacre in Time of Peace and League, treacherously executed\r\nby the native infidels upon the English, the Twenty-second of March,\r\n1622, published by Authority_.” The general trend of the tract is to\r\nshow the good that might result to the plantation from this disaster.\r\nNumber five of the possible results reads: “Because the Indians, who\r\nbefore were used as friends, may now most justly be compelled to\r\nservitude in mines, and the like, of whom some may be sent for the use\r\nof the Summer Islands.”[410]\r\n\r\nThe policy advocated by the tract was carried out in succeeding\r\nIndian wars in Virginia. The accounts of a certain Thomas Smallcomb,\r\nlieutenant at Fort Royal on Pamunkey, who was probably killed in the\r\nwar with Opechancanough, show him possessed at the time of his death,\r\n1646, of several Indian slaves.[411] It seems probable that these\r\nslaves were captives in war. After his rebellion, 1676, Bacon sold some\r\nof his Indian prisoners.[412] The rest were disposed of by Governor\r\nBerkeley.[413]\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the colony, the settlers of Carolina were in\r\ntrouble with the Indians. In September, 1671, war was declared against\r\nthe Kussoe, a tribe on the southern frontier who posed as allies of the\r\nSpaniards, and who vexed the Carolina settlers with petty depredations.\r\nThe Kussoe were quickly defeated, and the prisoners sent to be sold out\r\nof the colony, unless ransomed by their countrymen.[414] During the war\r\nwith the Stono Indians in 1680, the captive Indians were brought to\r\nCharleston and sold by Governor West to the traders in the colony to be\r\ncarried to the West Indies as slaves.[415]\r\n\r\nThe breaking out of the war of the Spanish Succession in 1701 gave\r\nGovernor Moore a chance to attack the Spanish Indians, capture and\r\nsell them under the excuse of the rules of war. Therefore, in 1702,\r\nhe led a force of militia and Indians against St. Augustine, burned\r\nthe city, and carried off, as slaves, whatever Indians he could\r\nobtain from the Spanish Indian villages along the way.[416] A second\r\nattack on St. Augustine was made by Moore in 1704, with the purpose of\r\ndestroying missions and carrying off slaves.[417] An advance into the\r\nterritories of the Apalachee resulted in the destruction of several\r\nmissions, and the capture of more than a thousand Indians, some free,\r\nsome slave.[418] Nearly all the Apalachee were distributed as slaves\r\namong the Carolina settlers.[419] The enslavement of Indians, indeed,\r\nwas carried on wholesale. A letter to the proprietors, July 10, 1708,\r\nstates that “the garrison of St. Augustine is by this war reduced to\r\nthe bare walls, their cattle and Indian towns all consumed, either by\r\nus in our invasion of that place, or by our Indian subjects ... they\r\nhave driven the Floridians to the islands of the cape, have brought in\r\nand sold many hundred of them, and maybe now continue that trade, so\r\nthat in some five years, they’ll reduce the barbarians to a fearless\r\nnumber.”[420] In 1708, Colonel Barnwell of South Carolina made an\r\nexpedition to the Appalachian province of Florida. It is thought that\r\nthis was the time when Captain Nairn of South Carolina, with a party\r\nof Yamasee Indians, advanced to the vicinity of Lake Okechobee and\r\nbrought back a number of captive Indians as slaves.[421] A similar\r\nexpedition of Colonel Palmer in 1727 against the Yamasee resulted in\r\nthe destruction of many Indian towns, the slaughter of many natives,\r\nand the carrying off of great numbers to Charleston as slaves.[422]\r\n\r\nAs the result of the three expeditions sent by South Carolina from\r\n1702 to 1708 against the Yamasee, Apalachee, and Timucua of northern\r\nFlorida, there was carried back to Charleston, for sale as slaves,\r\nalmost the entire population of seven towns, in all, some 1400\r\npersons.[423] The captives taken in 1715 when the Yamasee and Creek\r\nIndians made a foray upon the South Carolina frontier, were sold as\r\nslaves. Mr. Johnston, a South Carolina missionary of the Society for\r\nthe Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, in his letter to\r\nthe Society, December 19, 1715, states: “It is certain many of the\r\nYammousees and Creek Indians were against the war all along. But our\r\nmilitary men were so bent upon revenge, and so desirous to enrich\r\nthemselves by making all the Indians slaves that fall into yr hands ...\r\nthat it is in vain to represent the cruelty and injustice of such a\r\nprocedure”.[424]\r\n\r\nThroughout the Tuscarora War in North Carolina, Indian captives\r\nwere retained or sold as slaves.[425] At the beginning of military\r\noperations, following the Indian massacre of 1711, the friendly Indians\r\nagreed to help the English against their enemy upon promise of a reward\r\nof six blankets for each man killed by them, and the usual price of\r\nslaves for each woman and child delivered as captives.[426] During\r\nthe course of the war several hundred Indian allies were used by the\r\nEnglish,[427] and these allies took advantage of the opportunity to\r\nobtain large number of Indian captives to sell to the slave traders of\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nIn an attack on an Indian fort in 1711, thirty-nine women and children\r\nwere captured and disposed of in the settlements as slaves.[428] The\r\ntwo chief expeditions during the war were those of Colonel Barnwell,\r\nwho was sent by South Carolina in January, 1712, and of Colonel Moore\r\nin January and February, 1713. Colonel Barnwell’s expedition took two\r\nhundred Indian women and children prisoners.[429] The expedition of\r\nColonel Moore virtually ended the war by capturing the fort in which\r\nthe Tuscarora had taken refuge.[430] Nine hundred men, women and\r\nchildren were killed or taken prisoners.[431] In both expeditions the\r\nallied Indians secured as many as possible of the captured Indians\r\nwhom they took along with them to sell as slaves in Charleston,[432]\r\nand they still further increased their supply of slaves by attacking\r\nthe peaceful Indians along the route of their return to South\r\nCarolina.[433] During the course of the war more than seven hundred\r\nIndians were sold into slavery.[434]\r\n\r\nThe earliest of the slave-producing wars in New England was that with\r\nthe Pequot in 1637. The war consisted of two battles: the Mistick\r\nFight, and the Swamp Fight. In the first of these two events, but\r\nseven captives were taken.[435] In the second, the Swamp Fight, about\r\none hundred and eighty captives were taken.[436] Two of the sachems\r\ntaken in the Swamp Fight were spared, on promise that they guide the\r\nEnglish to the retreat of Sassacus. The other men captives, some\r\ntwenty or thirty in number, were put to death.[437] The remaining\r\ncaptives, consisting of about eighty women and children, were divided.\r\nSome were given to the soldiers, whether gratis or for pay does not\r\nappear. Thirty were given to the Narraganset who were allies of the\r\nEnglish, forty-eight were sent to Massachusetts and the remainder\r\nwere assigned to Connecticut.[438] The women and girls of the\r\nMassachusetts captives were distributed among the towns.[439] It\r\nseems probable that Connecticut made a similar disposition of its\r\nshare of the captives regardless of sex.[440] The male children among\r\nthe Massachusetts captives were ordered by the Massachusetts general\r\ncourt, 1637, to be carried to the Bermudas by William Pierce, and sold\r\nthere as slaves.[441] The shipload of Indians, however, consisting of\r\nfifteen boys and two women was taken by Captain Pierce to the West\r\nIndies., instead of to the Bermudas, and disposed of at the island\r\nof Providence.[442] One Pequot seized near Block Island was sent to\r\nEngland.[443]\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this single cargo of women and children was not\r\nthe only one sent to the islands at this time. A letter from the\r\nCompany of Providence Islands, replying from London, July 3, 1638, to\r\nletters from authorities on the island, and directing that special\r\ncare be taken of the “cannibal negroes brought from New England,”[444]\r\nand a second letter written in 1639, when the company, fearing the\r\ndanger that might arise from too large a number of negroes on the\r\nisland, suggested that the negroes be sold or sent to New England\r\nor Virginia,[445] may possibly have been called forth by a further\r\npurchase of Indians, or by an exchange of negroes for them.\r\n\r\nBy the time of King Philip’s War, 1675–1676, the colonists were well\r\naccustomed to the sending of Indian captives out of the country, and\r\nto the use of them in their homes.[446] The policy followed toward the\r\nIndians captured in this war was the same as that shown in the Pequot\r\nWar. The captives were either exported for sale in the European or West\r\nIndian slave markets, or were retained in servitude in the colonies. In\r\nthe beginning of the war, Captain Moseley captured eighty Indians, who\r\nwere retained at Plymouth. In the following September, one hundred and\r\nseventy-eight were put on board a vessel commanded by Captain Sprague\r\nwho sailed from Plymouth with them for Spain.[447] In this same year,\r\n1675, Indians, probably from the coast of Maine, were landed as slaves\r\nat Fayal, one of the Azores.[448] Again in 1675, fifteen Indians were\r\ncaptured and sent to Boston, “tied neck to neck, like galley slaves.”\r\nMuch against the will of the populace they were given a trial. All\r\nwere finally acquitted except two who were sentenced to be sold out\r\nof the country as slaves.[449] During the years 1675 and 1676, one\r\nfinds mention of the sale of Indians in Plymouth in groups of about a\r\nhundred,[450] fifty-seven,[451] three,[452] one hundred and sixty,[453]\r\nten,[454] one.[455] From June 25, 1675 to September 23, 1676, the\r\nrecords show the sale by the Plymouth colonial authorities of one\r\nhundred and eighty-eight Indians.[456]\r\n\r\nIn the Massachusetts Bay colony a similar disposal of captives was\r\naccomplished. On one occasion about two hundred were transported and\r\nsold.[457] There is extant a paper written by Daniel Gookin in 1676,\r\none item of which is as follows: “a list of the Indian children that\r\ncame in with John of Packachooge.” The list shows twenty-one boys and\r\neleven girls distributed throughout the colony.[458]\r\n\r\nWith the close of the war after Philip’s death, many of the Indian\r\nchiefs were executed at Boston and Plymouth, and most of the remaining\r\nchiefs with their captive followers were sold and shipped off as\r\nslaves outside the colonies.[459] Those transported were carried to\r\nvarious parts: the Spanish West Indies, Spain, Portugal, Bermuda,\r\nVirginia,[460] and the Azores.[461]\r\n\r\nNot all the Indians whose lives were spared were transported.[462]\r\nGenerally the men, rather than the women and children, were thus\r\ndisposed of, though such was not always the case. One finds instances,\r\nlike that of Philip’s wife and son,[463] when women and children were\r\ntransported, and other instances when grown male Indians were retained\r\nin the colonies and sold to the colonists.[464]\r\n\r\nNot only were the Indians who themselves engaged in the war sold as\r\nslaves at home and abroad, but the wives and children of the captive\r\nmales were also seized and consigned to slavery. In 1677, the\r\nMassachusetts general court ordered that the Indian children, boys and\r\ngirls, whose parents had been in hostility with the colony or had lived\r\namong its enemies in the time of the war, and who were taken by force\r\nand given or sold to any of the inhabitants of the colony, should be at\r\nthe disposal of their masters or their assignees.[465] In the case of a\r\ncertain Praying Indian, who withdrew from the English side and joined\r\nthe Indian enemy, not only himself, but his wife and children were\r\ntaken prisoners and held as slaves until redeemed by Eliot.[466] The\r\nsame policy was followed in Plymouth. A case in point is that of the\r\nchief, Popanooie, whose wife and children were retained in the colony\r\nas slaves, while he himself was transported and sold into slavery.[467]\r\n\r\nBoth Plymouth and Massachusetts made a distinction between the\r\nchildren of those Indian enemies who were taken by force, and those\r\nwho voluntarily gave themselves up to the colonial authorities. The\r\nchildren of the latter were to serve as slaves only until twenty-four\r\nyears of age. The term of service of the former was not specified.[468]\r\n\r\nNeither Rhode Island nor Connecticut transported Indian slaves to\r\nthe West Indies. Both colonies, however, retained Indian captives\r\nof King Philip’s War, but only for limited periods of time, not for\r\nlife. During the war numerous bands of the Indians surrendered to\r\nthe English at Providence and Newport. The sentiment of the colony\r\nagainst enslaving Indians, here, as in Connecticut, the result of\r\nQuaker influence,[469] had already been shown. So, in accordance with\r\nthe spirit already expressed, it was voted by the town of Providence,\r\nAugust 14, 1676, to appoint a committee of five persons to dispose\r\nof the Indians there.[470] The town agreed to abide by the action of\r\nthe five men.[471] The committee decided to sell the Indians in the\r\ncolony for a term of years; one-half the proceeds of the sale to go to\r\nthe captors, and the other half to the public treasury. The length of\r\nservice was to depend upon the Indians’ ages. Those under five years\r\nwere to be simple bondsmen till thirty; all above five years, and under\r\nten, till thirty-eight; above ten and under fifteen, till twenty-seven;\r\nabove fifteen and under twenty, till twenty-six; such as were above\r\nthirty, seven years. Several receipts signed by this committee show\r\nthat such sales occurred.[472] A few days before, the Rhode Island\r\ncompanies had brought in forty-two Indian captives. These, and all\r\nother Indian prisoners held at the time, were sold into service in the\r\ncolony for a period of nine years.[473] The Indians thus sentenced did\r\nnot become actual slaves according to the strictest interpretation of\r\nthe term, since the persons who acquired them purchased only their\r\nservices for a stated period of time, and not for life. Their condition\r\nis better explained by the term “involuntary indenture”.\r\n\r\nDuring King Philip’s War Connecticut suffered nothing on its own soil\r\nfrom hostile Indians. In consequence the number of captive Indians\r\nenslaved was small, and only infrequent mention is found of these\r\ncaptives. A certain amount of the booty which the Connecticut troops\r\nassisted in taking fell to their lot, and among this booty were some\r\nof the captive Indians. An interesting record of such a slave is found\r\nin the account book of Major John Talcot (1674–1688) which includes\r\nhis accounts as treasurer of the colony during King Philip’s War. On\r\nopposite pages of the ledger occurs the following account (54–55):\r\n“1676. Captain John Stanton of Stonington, Dr., to Sundry Commissions\r\ngiven Captain Stanton to proceed against the Indians by which he gained\r\nmuch on the sale of captives”. “Contra, 1677, April 30. Per received\r\nan Indian girl of him, about seven years old, which he gave me for\r\ncommissions on the other side, or, at best, out of good will for any\r\nkindness to him”.[474]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the small number of Indian captives enslaved in the\r\ncolony, none was transported by colonial action. The privilege of thus\r\ngetting rid of undesirable and troublesome Indian slaves by selling\r\nthem out of the colony, was, however, conferred upon individual\r\nowners, when, May 10, 1677, the general court decreed: “for the\r\nprevention of those Indians running away, that are disposed in service\r\nby the Authority, that are of the enemy and have submitted to mercy,\r\nsuch Indians, if they be taken, shall be in the power of his master to\r\ndispose of him as a captive by transportation out of the country”.[475]\r\n\r\nDuring the Indian wars in Virginia Governor Berkeley himself in a\r\nletter, 1668, to Robert Smith, militia commander in the Rappahannock\r\ncountry, not only proposed that, with the consent of the council of\r\nwar, a war of extinction be waged against the northern Indians, but\r\nalso suggested that the colonial government defray the expenses of\r\nthe undertaking by the disposal of the women and children.[476] Smith\r\nsubmitted Governor Berkeley’s letter to the Rappahannock court for\r\napproval. In rendering their decision, the justices declared that\r\nthe conduct of the northern Indians, notably the “Doagges” and the\r\nneighboring Indians, justified the taking of severe measures against\r\nthem; and accordingly advised “with the assistance of Almighty God, by\r\nthe strength of our northern part, utterly to eradicate [them], without\r\nfurther encroachment than the spoils of our enemies”.[477]\r\n\r\nDuring Bacon’s rebellion in 1676, the assembly at his instigation\r\ndeclared the enslavement of Indians for life to be legal, and made\r\nprovision for granting captive Indians to soldiers as a partial\r\ninducement to volunteer.[478] This act was repealed by the general act\r\nsetting aside all the acts of this assembly that sat in 1676 under the\r\nrule of Bacon.[479] But it was again revived by the assembly of 1679\r\ncalled by Deputy-Governor Chicheley.[480] Legal enslavement of Indians\r\nwas prohibited by implication rather than by the terms of the act of\r\n1691.[481] But the North Carolina Indian troubles in November, 1711,\r\nonce more brought the old law forward, and captive Indians belonging\r\nto tribes at war with the English were directed to be transported and\r\nsold, those capturing them to have the money of the sale.[482]\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that, though in the case of Virginia, as in that of\r\nthe other colonies, the disposal of the Indians captured in war was\r\nsanctioned by the colonial government, the action of the Virginia\r\ngovernment in the matter ended with that sanction. By the acts of\r\n1643[483] and 1658,[484] the colony lost the right to possess servants.\r\nTherefore, the government during the Indian wars decreed that the\r\ncaptive Indians were the property of their captors who were entitled to\r\nthe proceeds of their sale.[485]\r\n\r\nIn the case of Maryland is found another colony in which the government\r\nintended that Indian captives taken in war should be sold for the\r\nbenefit of the colony. At the time of the Puritan ascendency the\r\nIndians began to be troublesome.[486] The Nanticoke of the Eastern\r\nshore began a war upon the settlers. March 29, 1652, on petition of\r\nthe settlers, the general assembly attempted to pass a militia act. An\r\nexpedition was planned, and a levy of troops made.[487] The captive\r\nIndians were to be sold. But the government never had a chance to carry\r\nout any such sale, for the Puritans of Anne Arundel County refused to\r\nmake their levies, and the expedition had to be abandoned.[488]\r\n\r\nDuring the Tuscarora War in North Carolina, one again finds an\r\ninstance of a colonial government taking possession of the captive\r\nIndians, selling them as slaves, and depositing the proceeds of\r\nthe sales in the colonial treasury. At the breaking out of the war\r\nGovernor Hyde instructed the agents whom he sent to South Carolina to\r\nask for military aid to represent to the colonial authorities there\r\n“the great advantage that may be made of slaves, there being many\r\nhundreds of them, women and children; may we not believe three or four\r\nthousand”.[489] The colony, indeed, found the disposal of the captives\r\nto be as profitable as had been hoped. The promised reward of slaves\r\nas pay for services rendered brought the desired Indian allies. On one\r\noccasion, Tom Blount, chief of a tribe of friendly Indians in the area\r\nof disturbance, in making arrangements with the colonial government\r\nfor an attack on a certain tribe, specified that his warriors receive\r\npayment in captives, and failing these, in other commodities.[490]\r\n\r\nThe journals of the North Carolina council for June 25, 1713, show\r\nnegotiations between acting Governor Pollock and the council for the\r\npurchase of a number of Indians for shipment to the West Indies.[491]\r\nIt was sometimes a problem to provide for the captured Indians;\r\nconsequently in the same year the assembly chartered a private sloop to\r\ncarry away captives brought by friendly Indians.[492]\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, the Indian captives taken in the early war with the\r\nKussoe were sold as slaves by governor and council with the sanction\r\nof the proprietors, who, though they had forbidden the enslavement\r\nof Indians in the temporary laws sent out to Governor Sayle in 1671,\r\nwere nevertheless the first to grant the privilege of selling Indian\r\ncaptives from Carolina to the West Indies, as the cheapest means of\r\n“encouraging the soldiers of the infant colony”.[493] Accordingly,\r\nwhen war broke out with the Stono Indians in 1680, Governor West,\r\ntaking advantage of the precedent already established and the expressed\r\nsanction of the proprietors for such an action, offered a price for\r\nevery Indian that should be taken and brought to Charleston,[494] and\r\nobtained the funds he needed for defense by selling the Indians to the\r\ntraders.[495] The plan proved successful, so successful, in fact, as to\r\narouse the jealousy of the proprietors, for West appropriated some of\r\nthe profits for his own benefit. The proprietors sanctioned the sale of\r\nIndians taken in actual warfare for the benefit of the colony, which\r\nmeant for their own benefit. Their title to the colony rested upon the\r\nclaims of England to this territory by right of conquest.[496] The\r\nIndians were the captives and the conquered people of that conquest. By\r\nthe rules of war the conquered people were at the mercy and disposal\r\nof the conquerors, and since the proprietors found more profit in\r\nselling than in killing the captive Indians, they naturally resented\r\nWest’s taking their profits for other purposes.\r\n\r\nBy the time of the wars in the early eighteenth century, the power\r\nof the proprietors was broken, and the assembly took charge of the\r\nmatter of disposing of captives in war. An act passed September 10,\r\n1702, provided that the Indian slaves taken by the Yamasee and the\r\nother Indian allies on the expedition to St. Augustine in 1702,\r\nshould be bought only by a committee of four named by the assembly.\r\nThe slaves would then be disposed of to help meet the expenses of\r\nthe expedition.[497] But the committee neglected to carry out its\r\ninstructions, and another act of May 8, 1703, provided that the slaves\r\ntaken on the expedition might be bought by anyone, and the Indian\r\nallies be thus encouraged.[498]\r\n\r\nThat all the Indian captives taken on the second expedition to St.\r\nAugustine in 1704 were not sold as slaves was due to an order of the\r\nassembly expressed through the governor.[499] Moore lamented this fact,\r\nas the plunder of his men, which he estimated should have been £100\r\nto a man, would thus be much diminished. That he still hoped with the\r\ngovernor’s assistance “to find a way to gratify them for the loss of\r\nblood”, may mean that he had not yet given up the idea of selling those\r\nIndian captives whom he called “free”.[500]\r\n\r\nAs a part of the preparation for self-defense made by South Carolina\r\nin 1707 and 1708, acts were passed giving the commanding officer of\r\nany expedition the power of commissioner to buy all prisoners of the\r\nIndian enemy above the age of twelve years that should be taken captive\r\nby the white forces or the Indian allies. The slaves so bought were to\r\nbe delivered to the public receiver, who was directed to pay for them\r\nnot to exceed the sum of £7 for every Indian, and then to ship them to\r\nthe islands of the West Indies for sale, or to dispose of them within\r\nthe colony for the use of the public to any person who would enter into\r\nbonds, with the penalty of £200, not to send or carry any slave so\r\nbought to any place within the province, or to the northward thereof.\r\nAny white person refusing to sell such slave to the commanding officer,\r\nmust dispose of the slave himself, as before described, within the\r\nspace of one month, or forfeit the same to the receiver for the use of\r\nthe public, to be disposed of as aforesaid.[501] In 1715, however, the\r\nlaw was changed so as to read that all Indian enemies captured should\r\nbe handed over to the public receiver for the use of the public, the\r\nreceiver to sell such as slaves to those who would pay the highest\r\nprice, and who would promise to export them from the colony within the\r\nperiod of two months after the sale.[502]\r\n\r\nDuring the French and Indian War, the Cherokee Indians began\r\nhostilities with the English. North Carolina, in the provisions made\r\nin 1760 for raising troops against them, offered to anyone who took\r\ncaptive “an enemy Indian” the right to hold him as a slave.[503] By\r\nthe treaty concluded by South Carolina with the Cherokee at the close\r\nof the war, it was provided that the captives on each side should be\r\ngiven up. The North Carolinians, however, followed the policy advocated\r\nin 1760, and the Indians accordingly retaliated by carrying off two\r\nwhite girls from South Carolina to Pensacola, and demanded, before\r\nreleasing them, that those of their own people held in captivity should\r\nfirst be given up.[504]\r\n\r\nIn both of the New England Indian wars discussed, the disposal of\r\nthe captives fell under the immediate jurisdiction of the respective\r\ncolonial governments, and was carried on either by the general court,\r\nas in the case of Massachusetts, or by a council of war which was a\r\ncommittee of the general court, as in the case of Plymouth. Though\r\nduring the Pequot War Connecticut sent no Indians to the West Indies,\r\nstill it was customary for the government to sell them out of the\r\ncolony during the period following the war. This appears from a law\r\npassed in 1656 by the general court, forbidding such sale outside\r\nthe boundaries of “the other three colonies”, without the consent of\r\nthe authorities of the plantation “under the penalty of £10 for each\r\ndefault”.[505]\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the New England colonial governments, so definitely\r\nexpressed during the Pequot War, was continually shown from that time\r\nuntil King Philip’s War. During that period, 1636–1675, New England\r\nwas the scene of constant intertribal Indian difficulties between the\r\nMohegan and Narraganset tribes. Because of the danger resulting from\r\nthese disturbances, Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Connecticut and New\r\nHaven entered into confederation for mutual defense, under the name of\r\nthe United Colonies of New England. The articles containing the terms\r\nof the intercolonial agreement, drawn up May 19, 1643, expressed the\r\nsame spirit that was shown during the Pequot War, for they provided\r\nthat “the whole advantage of the war ..., whether it be in lands,\r\ngoods or persons, shall be proportionally divided among the said\r\nconfederates”.[506]\r\n\r\nContinued disturbances led the commissioners of the United Colonies to\r\nprepare for a campaign against the Narraganset Indians in 1645. Captain\r\nJohn Mason was put in command of the forces raised. In keeping with\r\nthe provision of the articles already mentioned, his commission, dated\r\nJuly, 1645, concluded thus: “what booty you take or prisoners, whether\r\nmen, women or children, you may send to Seabrook fort, to be kept and\r\nimproved for the advantage of the colonies in several proportions\r\nanswering to their charges, etc.”[507]\r\n\r\nDuring King Philip’s War the various New England governments, with\r\nMassachusetts and Plymouth in the lead, again took charge of the\r\ndisposal of the captive Indians. Various methods were adopted to\r\nconvert their Indian captives into a source of immediate revenue. One\r\nwas to sell them outright outside of the colonies, or, on occasion,\r\nwithin the colonies, and thus replenish the exchequer, and, so far as\r\nmight be, defray the expenses of the war. At a meeting of the Plymouth\r\nCourt in 1676 to consider the disposal of more than a hundred captives,\r\nthe conclusion was reached, “upon serious and deliberate consideration\r\nand agitation” concerning them, “to sell the greater number into\r\nservitude”.[508] A little later, in the same year, several more were\r\nsold.[509] In each case the colonial treasurer was ordered to effect\r\nthe sale for the benefit of the colony. A fiscal report of Plymouth for\r\nthe period from June 25, 1675, to September 23, 1676, gives among the\r\ncredits the following, which relates to the sale of the one hundred and\r\neighty-eight Indians already mentioned: “By the following accounts,\r\nreceived in, or as silver, viz.: captives, for 188 prisoners at war\r\nsold, £397 13s.”[510]\r\n\r\nRecords of similar events are found in Massachusetts Bay. On November\r\n4, 1676, the magistrates and deputies adopted a report of a committee\r\nof the general court providing for the selling abroad of several\r\nIndians.[511] Again, on September 16, 1676, the general court passed an\r\nact for handing over the disposal of certain captured Indians to the\r\ncouncil. The general court expressed the opinion that such of them as\r\nhad shed English blood should suffer death. The inference concerning\r\nthe remainder is that they were to be sold.[512]\r\n\r\nA second method of paying debts by the use of captives was to direct\r\nthe treasurer of the colony to dispose of a certain number of Indians,\r\nand turn the proceeds to the account of a certain individual in whose\r\ndebt the colony stood; or to give a certain number of Indians to such\r\na person, usually with the stipulation that the Indians be at once\r\nsold out of the colony. An instance of the first kind occurred in\r\nPlymouth, October 4, 1675, when the general court voted with “reference\r\nto such emergent charges that have fallen on our honored governor,\r\nthe summer past, the court have settled and conferred on him, the\r\nprice of ten Indians of those savages lately transported out of the\r\ngovernment”.[513] The second method is illustrated by a later act of\r\nthe Plymouth court, August 24, 1676, when, along with ten Indians\r\nordered by the court to be delivered to Captain Benjamin Church and\r\nCaptain Anthony Low for transportation out of the colony, one Indian\r\nwas ordered “to be at the disposal of Henry Lilly, which he receives\r\nin full satisfaction for his attendance at this court.” This Indian,\r\nlike the others, was to be transported.[514] How far the receipts from\r\nthe sale of captives went toward meeting the expenses of the colony is\r\nnot known. It must, however, have been but a short way, if one is to\r\njudge by the condition of the colonial exchequer at the time and the\r\nexpedients adopted by the colonial government to obtain money to defend\r\nthe frontiers and meet the other expenses of war.[515]\r\n\r\nStill a third way was to grant the captured Indians directly to\r\nthose who took them prisoners, as a bounty for their capture. The\r\nMassachusetts act of 1695, which, along with the rewards for killing\r\nIndians,[516] conferred on the soldiers for their own use all plunder\r\nand provisions taken from the enemy, appears to have been the earliest\r\nrelinquishment by the provincial government of its sovereign right\r\nto prisoners and captives.[517] In the later laws liberal premiums\r\nwere continued for scalps, and volunteer captors of Indians were, by\r\nthe law of 1706, granted the benefit of captives and plunder.[518] A\r\nlaw of 1703 provided that the governor and council, in the absence of\r\nthe general assembly, possessed the power to pay for Indian captives\r\nunder ten years old the sum of £3, and stated that they could use the\r\nIndians thus obtained, either for the redemption of English captives\r\namong the Indians, or else they could sell them across the sea.[519]\r\nAnother law of the same year granted the regular forces the benefit\r\nof the sale of all Indian prisoners under the age of ten years taken\r\nby them to be transported out of the country, the profits of the\r\nsale to be shared among the officers and men of the company engaged,\r\nproportionally to their wages. All volunteers were, likewise, to have\r\nthe benefit of all Indian prisoners under the age of ten years by them\r\ntaken.[520] By such legal action Massachusetts was in reality putting a\r\npremium on slave catching.\r\n\r\nThe colonial governments not only sold the Indian captives themselves,\r\nbut sometimes authorized their military commanders so to do. On January\r\n15, 1676, the governor of Massachusetts issued instructions to Captain\r\nBenjamin Church to go against the Indians, and to distribute among his\r\nmen the plunder and captives according to such agreement as captain and\r\ncompany might make. The instructions read: “And it shall be lawful, and\r\nis hereby warranted, for him to make sale of such prisoners as their\r\nperpetual slaves; or otherwise to retain them, as they think meet (they\r\nbeing such as the law allows to be kept)”.[521] On August 28, 1676,\r\nalso, the governor of Plymouth wrote to the governor of Rhode Island\r\nthat Captain Church had been chosen and authorized by Plymouth “to\r\ndemand and receive of the governor of Rhode Island” all the captive\r\nIndians, and to guard and conduct them to Plymouth, or to sell and\r\ndispose of them, as he chose, to the “inhabitants or others for terms\r\nof life, or for shorter times, as there may be reasons”.[522]\r\n\r\nNo exception to this custom of enslavement was made in the case of the\r\nPraying Indians. During the course of the war several of these Indians,\r\n“through the harsh dealings of the English”, and because of neglect to\r\nprovide them with “sufficient shelter, protection and encouragement”,\r\njoined the warring Indians.[523] Such of these Indians as were taken\r\nin arms were declared by the Massachusetts general court to be in\r\nrebellion, and were tried and sentenced, some to be killed, but the\r\nmost of them to be transported and sold as slaves.[524]\r\n\r\nCaptives were also retained as slaves in the colony, especially\r\nthe women and children. For instance, in 1675, in return for the\r\nprivilege granted by Mr. Shrimpton of Noddle’s Island to quarter one\r\nhundred Indians upon that island free of charge, the general court of\r\nMassachusetts ordered five Christian Indian prisoners to be delivered\r\nto him to be employed on Noddle’s Island, “he returning them to the\r\norder of the council”.[525]\r\n\r\nIt is very probable, as Gookin asserts, that instances are not lacking\r\nin which some of the Praying Indians were sold as slaves under\r\naccusations which were false.[526] Such happened also in the case\r\nof other Indians. Their promises were not considered sincere by the\r\ncolonial authorities, for a result of the war was an intense hatred and\r\nsuspicion of all Indians.[527] The Praying Indians were sufficiently\r\nnumerous to be a dangerous factor, and the colonial authorities\r\nintended to give them no chance to gain the advantage.[528]\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the number of enslaved Indian captives retained\r\nin Massachusetts, that number was sufficiently large to cause some\r\nuneasiness on the part of both authorities and people. On July 22,\r\n1676, the general court of Plymouth confirmed an act of the council of\r\nwar declaring that, because of the danger to the peace and safety of\r\nthe colony incurred by having Indian captives residing there, no male\r\ncaptive above the age of fourteen years of age should reside in the\r\ncolony; and that, if any such captive above that age was then resident\r\nin the colony, he was to be disposed of out of the colony before\r\nOctober 15, 1676, or be forfeited to the government.[529] It is not\r\nlikely that the act was rigorously enforced during its brief existence.\r\nExceptions to the law were doubtless made by the court from time to\r\ntime.[530]\r\n\r\nAnother act of similar tenor was passed March 29, 1677, when the\r\nMassachusetts council in an order, the preamble of which shows much\r\nalarm on the part of the people, decreed that no one within the colony\r\nshould thereafter buy or keep, more than ten days after the publication\r\nof the council’s decree, any Indian men or women already bought, above\r\nthe age of twelve years, without allowance from authority. A fine of\r\n£5, and the forfeit of the Indian or Indians concerned were fixed as\r\na penalty for violation of the law.[531] Toward the end of the year\r\nPlymouth still further extended governmental supervision of captives\r\nby decreeing, March 5, 1678, that no one was to buy the children of\r\nthe captive Indians taken during the late war, “without special leave,\r\nliking and approbation of the government of this jurisdiction”.[532]\r\n\r\nThe seizure of Indians by authority of the colonial governments, and\r\ntheir subsequent sale, were not always above suspicion. At the time of\r\nthe Narraganset troubles, in 1646, Plymouth gave legal sanction for\r\nthe seizure of peaceable and unsuspecting Indians whose tribes were at\r\npeace with the English.[533] A second instance of the same character\r\noccurred during King Philip’s War shortly after the destruction of\r\nDartmouth in 1675. The Dartmouth Indians had not been concerned in the\r\nburning of the town, so the whites entered into negotiations of peace\r\nand friendship with them, and the captains of the resident militia and\r\nthe Plymouth forces sent thither promised them protection. But through\r\nother influences they were conducted to Plymouth, and, by order of the\r\ncouncil, August 4, 1675, they were sold and “transported out of the\r\nCountry, being about Eight-score Persons”.[534] On September 2, 1675,\r\nthe council took similar action in the case of “a parcel of Indians\r\nlately come into Sandwich, in a submissive way to this colony. They\r\nwere adjudged to be “in the same condition of rebellion”, and were\r\ncondemned, fifty-seven in number, to perpetual servitude.[535]\r\n\r\nA fourth, and far more notable instance of bad faith on the part of the\r\nEnglish, occurred at Cocheco (Dover, New Hampshire) during the Indian\r\ndifficulties in that section, contemporaneous with and following King\r\nPhilip’s War. Major Waldron was in command of the local garrison, and\r\nhad gathered about him four hundred Indians, about two hundred of whom\r\nwere refugees who had fled there for protection after the death of\r\nKing Philip, which Waldron had promised them. The depredations of the\r\nAndroscoggin Indians at Casco and the devastation of the settlements\r\non the Kennebec caused the Massachusetts government to send a military\r\nforce into that locality, with orders to seize all southern Indians\r\nwherever they could find them. In obedience to this order the leaders\r\nof the Massachusetts troops wished to seize the Indians at once, but\r\nWaldron hesitated to break his promise and proposed a stratagem to\r\navoid disastrous results. His suggestion was followed, and all the\r\nIndians were disarmed and made prisoners, September 7, 1676. The\r\n“strange Indians”, or those who had come from the south, two hundred\r\nin number, were retained and sent to Boston. Seven or eight who were\r\nconvicted of having shed English blood were condemned to death; the\r\nrest were sold into slavery in foreign parts.[536]\r\n\r\nToward the close of the war orders were given by certain of the New\r\nEngland colonies to the constables to seize all Indians remaining in\r\nthe colonies after a specific date. All who had been concerned in the\r\ndeath of a colonist or the destruction of property were to be summarily\r\nexecuted. Those who remained friendly or had finally assisted the\r\nEnglish, were allowed to retain their lands and continue their regular\r\nlife. The others were to be sold by the treasurers of the various\r\ncolonies for the benefit of their respective governments.[537]\r\n\r\nThe locating of those Indians that remained after the war, and the\r\nnecessity of maintaining order, resulted, 1677, in the government\r\nof Massachusetts settling the groups of Indians, Praying as well as\r\nunconverted, in various localities, and the distribution of some to\r\n“remain as servants in English families” where they were to be taught\r\nand instructed in the Christian religion. Both the captive male Indians\r\nand their families were held as slaves. Massachusetts and Plymouth\r\nlimited the time of servitude of the children of “friendly Indians”, or\r\nthose who surrendered and assisted the English, to the time when they\r\nshould become twenty-four years of age.[538] The time of service of\r\nthe children of the warring Indians was not so limited.\r\n\r\nSince King Philip’s War was never carried into Connecticut territory,\r\nthe problem of disposing of Indian captives never assumed the same\r\nimportance there as in Massachusetts, and the Connecticut government\r\ndid not export its captive Indians. On October 23, 1676, as a measure\r\nintended to induce the surrender of the warring tribes and so hasten\r\nthe conclusion of the war, the general court ordered that all Indians\r\nwho surrendered before January 1, 1677, should not be sold out of\r\nthe country as slaves. The measure, however, permitted their use as\r\ntemporary slaves in the colony. They were to receive good usage in\r\nthe service of those to whom the council might dispose of them, and\r\nafter ten years, all over sixteen years of age, on certificate of good\r\nbehavior from their masters regarding their good service during that\r\nperiod, were to have their liberty and be allowed to dwell in the\r\ncolony and work for themselves, provided they observed English law. If\r\nthe master should refuse such certificate, then the Indian could apply\r\nto the authorities and have his case decided. The council was given\r\npower to lengthen the term of servitude if it should see cause, but\r\ncould not shorten it. All Indians under sixteen years of age were to\r\nserve until twenty-six years of age.[539]\r\n\r\nAt a meeting, November 24, 1676, the Connecticut council decided upon\r\nits method of procedure. A committee was appointed to meet at Norwich\r\non the second Wednesday of the following December to “dispose and\r\nsettle all surrenders according to order”. All Indians expecting\r\nto have the benefit of the declaration must then and there appear.\r\nAfter that time all those who had shown hostility to the English were\r\nexcluded from the privilege and were to be dealt with as enemies, as\r\nwere also those who should hide or harbor them. The notice of the\r\ncouncil’s action was to be sent among the various Indians of the\r\ncolony. The instructions of the committee appointed directed them,\r\namong other things, to take all young and single persons of all sorts\r\nto put into English families to be apprentices for ten years. After\r\nthat they were to be returned to their parents on proof of their own\r\nand their parents’ fidelity. Otherwise they were to be sold into\r\nslavery. The general court appointed certain persons in each county\r\nto receive and distribute these Indian children proportionally, and\r\nto see that they were sold to good families. Those counties which had\r\nalready had some share of the surrendered Indians and captives or which\r\nhad too many Indians already, were not to receive as many as the other\r\ncounties.[540]\r\n\r\nThe Rhode Island authorities also limited the bondage of Indians to\r\na period of years. On May 18, 1652, the colony passed a law “that\r\nno black mankind or white” should be “forced by covenant, bond or\r\notherwise, to serve any man or his assignees longer than ten years,\r\nor until they became twenty-four years of age, if they be taken in\r\nunder fourteen, from the time of their coming within the limits of\r\nthe colony; and at the end of the term of ten years, they were to be\r\nset free, as the manner is with English servants”.[541] Either the\r\nframers of the law intended that Indians be included under the terms\r\n“black mankind or white”, or else the subject of Indian slavery had not\r\nyet attracted the attention of the law makers at this time. Probably\r\nthe latter is the true explanation of the omission of the term “Indian”\r\nfrom the act, though at a later time the same restriction of service\r\nwas applied to Indians without legislation.\r\n\r\nOn March 13, 1676, the general assembly convened at Newport and\r\ndiscussed the Indian situation. An order was given that “no Indian in\r\nthis colony shall be a slave”, save only for debts, covenant, etc., “as\r\nif they had been countrymen not at war”.[542] But Rhode Island did not\r\navail itself of every opportunity to retain captive Indians. On one\r\noccasion the assembly voted, June 30, 1676, to send back to Plymouth\r\na number of Indians whom Roger Williams had sent there, because they\r\nbelieved the Indians rightly belonged to the northern colony.[543]\r\nAgain, on August 23, 1676, the government held a court martial for\r\nthe trial of some Indians whom the Rhode Island troops had captured.\r\nSeveral of these Indians were sentenced to death for crimes against the\r\nEnglish. Others were freed. None was retained in the colony.[544]\r\n\r\nThe assembly made an earnest effort to prevent the indiscriminate and\r\nunfair sale of Indians not taking part in the war, by forbidding during\r\nits session in August, 1676, that any Indians be brought into the\r\ncolony without permission of the governor and two assistants, under\r\npenalty of a fine of £5 and the forfeit of such Indian or Indians.\r\nThe sum of the fine and the forfeited Indians were “to return to the\r\ntreasurer of each town”. All persons were declared to be entitled\r\nto half the produce of the Indians whom they might legally bring to\r\nNewport. The other half was to go to the treasury. If such an amount\r\nwas not paid in, the said Indians were to be forfeited to the treasurer\r\nof the colony. It was also forbidden to carry any Indian away from\r\nthe colony without a permit from the governor, deputy-governor or\r\ntwo magistrates, upon penalty of the forfeiture of £5. All acts,\r\norders, commissions, verbal orders, etc., which had been issued by\r\ntown councils, councils of war, private orders of officers and “other\r\nministers of justice”, which related to Indians, were declared legal by\r\nthe assembly.[545]\r\n\r\nSuch action as that referred to in this measure was taken at a town\r\nmeeting in Portsmouth, March 8, 1675. The meeting, fearing that the\r\nholding of Indian slaves might prove “prejudicial”, ordered that all\r\npersons of the town having any Indian slave of either sex should be\r\ngiven but one month to sell and send such out of the town, and that no\r\ninhabitant after that time should buy or keep an Indian slave under\r\npenalty of £5 fine for each month thus holding such a slave, the amount\r\nof the fine to be paid to the town treasurer.[546]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                 +Processes of Enslavement: Kidnapping+\r\n\r\n\r\nThe process of obtaining Indians by kidnapping was common to the early\r\nEnglish explorers in America, as well as to those of Spain and France.\r\nIn 1498, the expedition of Sebastian Cabot brought back to England\r\nthree natives from the New World.[547] Lord Bacon states that two of\r\nthe Indians “were seen two years afterward, dressed like Englishmen,\r\nand not to be distinguished from them”.[548] The Cabots had set off,\r\npromising to bring home heavy cargoes of spices and oriental gems. They\r\nreturned with empty ships and with nothing to relate concerning the\r\nsought-for land of Cathay. Their expedition had not reached its desired\r\ndestination, but some of the natives would serve as proof of another\r\nland discovered, and would, perhaps, provoke sufficient interest to\r\nassure the fitting out of a second expedition.[549] These Indians\r\nwere not destined for the slave markets, and were probably kept as\r\ncuriosities.\r\n\r\nEngland still hoped to find the northwest passage to the Orient. In\r\n1576, Frobisher made another attempt in that direction. He desired to\r\ntake away some token as proof of his having been in the New World, and,\r\nas it was supposed the Indians had destroyed or stolen three of his\r\nmen who were lost, he decided to take some savages captive by luring\r\nthem to trade. In this way one was captured, but died on reaching\r\nEngland.[550] A similar instance occurred on the second voyage in 1577.\r\nFrobisher planned to seize several Indians, bestow gifts upon them,\r\nand send them to their own people, hoping thus to win the friendship\r\nof the natives, after keeping one of them as interpreter. An attempt\r\nwas made to seize two, but one escaped. As a companion for this man, an\r\nIndian woman was afterward captured. Frobisher attempted to trade these\r\ncaptives for some lost Englishmen, but was unsuccessful;[551] so it is\r\nprobable that they were carried to England. The relation of the third\r\nvoyage, 1578, mentions a similar man and woman, but the narrator does\r\nnot state whether these were the same two taken on the second voyage,\r\ncarried to England, and brought back to America on the third voyage,\r\nor two others taken on the third voyage. These Indians provoked much\r\ncuriosity and comment in England, and pictures of them were made for\r\nthe queen and others.[552]\r\n\r\nThe search for the northwest passage was continued by Captain George\r\nWeymouth in 1605, under the patronage of Lord Popham and Sir Ferdinando\r\nGorges. Weymouth reached the coast of America at the mouth of the\r\npresent Penobscot River in Maine. By making presents to the Indians\r\nand by treating them kindly, he induced five of them to come on board\r\nhis ship. These five Indians were kidnapped and carried to England,\r\nalong with their canoes and the personal belongings which they had with\r\nthem at the time of capture. There appears to have been no feeling\r\nof opposition shown to such an act. Three of them were presented by\r\nWeymouth to Gorges, and two to Popham.[553] Gorges declared that\r\n“this accident must be acknowledged the means under God of putting on\r\nfoot and giving life to all our plantations”.[554] Weymouth did not\r\npropose to obtain financial profit by the sale of these Indians any\r\nmore than did his predecessors, Cabot and Frobisher. His immediate\r\npurpose was probably to please his patrons by a curious gift, and\r\ndoubtless he shared the purpose of Gorges and Popham of learning from\r\nthem the resources of their native land, and by instructing them, to\r\nhave them fitted to act as intelligent guides and interpreters in some\r\nfuture expedition. His instructions required that he treat the Indians\r\nkindly so that they might prove friendly to future settlements.[555]\r\nThe treatment of the captives in England was evidently kind. Gorges\r\nkept his Indians in his family three years and obtained from them the\r\nknowledge he desired. The Indians were shown to the curious, perhaps\r\nfor money, and it has been held that one, after death, was exhibited\r\nfor an admission price.[556]\r\n\r\nCaptain Edward Harlow, under the patronage of the Earl of Southampton,\r\nvisited America in 1611, and at “Monhigan Island” seized three Indians\r\nwho had come on board to trade. One of these escaped and incited his\r\nfriends to revenge, so Harlow proceeded southward and from the islands\r\nin the vicinity of Cape Cod kidnapped three others. With these five\r\nIndians he returned to England.[557]\r\n\r\nThough in the cases cited the Indians taken by the English were\r\nprobably not destined to actual slavery, yet instances are not wanting\r\nin which they were taken for that purpose. The profit to be derived\r\nfrom the sales in the slave markets was tempting. Just before sending\r\nout the expedition of 1614, Captain Henry Harley brought to Gorges a\r\nnative of the island of Capawick[558] (Martha’s Vineyard.) This Indian\r\nhad been captured with some twenty-nine others by a ship from London\r\nand taken to Spain for sale as a slave. The sale failed wholly or in\r\npart, and some of the Indians were brought to England and shown as\r\ncuriosities as the other Indians had been.[559] Gorges, though he had\r\nsanctioned the act of Weymouth, condemned the action of the captors of\r\nthis group of Indians, for he feared the Indians of America would be\r\nunfriendly to colonial enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe London ship above mentioned was one commanded by Thomas Hunt, and\r\nformed part of Smith’s expedition for the carrying of fish, furs and\r\noil from New England to Virginia and Malaga. Smith took the first ship\r\nto Virginia and left Hunt to take the other to Spain with a cargo of\r\ndry fish. But a cargo of slaves seemed to offer greater gain than one\r\nof fish. Twenty-seven Indians were taken captive off the Massachusetts\r\ncoast and sent to Spain. Among this number was Tisquantum (called\r\nSquantum by the English), who had formerly been captured by Weymouth,\r\nand who had been returned to America. Some of the Indians were sold in\r\nSpain for £20 apiece. By the interference of some monks the further\r\nsale of the Indians was prevented, and Squantum, at least, was carried\r\noff to England. When Gorges sent out Captain Hobson to America two of\r\nHunt’s captives accompanied him, but, on arrival, they escaped and so\r\naroused their friends that a settlement by Hobson was prevented. This\r\nfeeling of suspicion and hatred toward the English must have found\r\nexpression, if it had not been prevented by the deadly pestilence of\r\n1616 which weakened the Indians of New England, and by the intercession\r\nof Squantum who proved a firm friend of the English in arranging a\r\ntreaty with the Indians.[560] Hunt’s act was done entirely on his own\r\nresponsibility and without the knowledge or sanction of Smith who\r\ndenounced it as a vile deed, since it ever afterward kept him from\r\ntrading in those parts.[561]\r\n\r\nThe evidence of kidnapping in the southern colonies seems very meagre.\r\nThe existing records deal chiefly with other modes of obtaining Indians\r\nfor slaves. There were undoubtedly many cases of kidnapping pure and\r\nsimple, if we may judge by the general attitude of the colonists\r\ntoward the Indians; but kidnapping, considered as distinct from any\r\nsort of warfare, was not a suitable means of producing the number of\r\nIndians needed or desired by the Carolina colonists. Trade and war\r\nwere more prolific means, and hence were more largely used. Kidnapping\r\nwas a process of obtaining slaves suited only to a locality, or to an\r\noccasion when but few Indians were desired.\r\n\r\nYet certain incidents show the custom was practiced here as elsewhere.\r\nAn event of 1685 is probably only one of many such which occurred\r\non the southern coast and in the interior at the time of the Indian\r\ndisturbances in that section, before war had actually begun. In that\r\nyear a vessel from New York kidnapped four Indians in the locality of\r\nCape Fear, North Carolina, and carried them to New York for sale.[562]\r\nThat there was a certain amount of kidnapping carried on in the other\r\nsouthern colonies, as Virginia and Maryland, is shown by the colonial\r\nlegislation regarding the matter, which will be discussed later.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that it was customary to enslave Indian captives taken\r\nin war, and that certain colonial governments even allowed the seizure\r\nof peaceable Indians in time of war, lest they join with the warring\r\nIndians. The distinction between kidnapping, pure and simple, and\r\nseizures made in time of war, was too delicate to be always observed,\r\nand was open to abuse by unscrupulous persons desiring to obtain\r\nIndians for sale. Nowhere is this more clearly exemplified than in the\r\nNew England colonies. Here, as in the south, kidnapping was carried\r\non by the frontier people who were generally rough and lawless. Along\r\nwith indifference to the rights of the Indians, fraudulent practices in\r\ntrade, and refusal to sell them arms and ammunition on the slightest\r\nsuspicion that the weapons might be used against the whites, the\r\nkidnapping of Indians, and the selling of them as slaves in the West\r\nIndies were all numbered among the causes of King Philip’s War.[563]\r\n\r\nWith the opening of King Philip’s War the custom was continued. The\r\nMaine Indians were about to join those in Massachusetts when, through\r\nthe efforts of Abraham Shurt of Pemaquid, and by means of promises\r\nmade to right their wrongs and treat the native fairly in the future,\r\nthe union with the Massachusetts Indians was prevented, and assurances\r\nof friendship were exchanged with the English. Rumors were soon\r\nspread abroad, however, that the Indians were possessed of arms, and\r\nwere forming a conspiracy against the colony. The government became\r\nalarmed and issued a warrant to General Waldron of Cocheco (Dover, New\r\nHampshire) “to seize every Indian known to be a man slayer, traitor or\r\nconspirator”. Waldron took it upon himself to issue general warrants\r\nfor this purpose. These warrants fell into the hands of unprincipled\r\nmen who set about using them to immediate advantage. A vessel was\r\nfitted out at Pemaquid and a crew organized for the purpose of\r\nkidnapping Indians for sale abroad. Shurt remonstrated with the leaders\r\nof the proceeding and warned the Indians of their danger. But the plan\r\nsucceeded, at least in part. A vessel off Pemaquid, commanded by one\r\nLaughton, succeeded during the winter of 1676 in capturing several\r\nIndians, and carrying them abroad for sale. The Indians complained of\r\nthis action, but the only satisfaction they obtained was more offers\r\nof friendship and the promise that means should be taken to return\r\ntheir captured friends to them.[564] Waldron was indicted by the grand\r\njury for surprising and stealing seventeen Indians, carrying them off\r\nto Fayal in the vessel _Endeavor_ and selling them there, but was\r\nacquitted. John Laughton, captain of the vessel, was also indicted for\r\nthe same offenses, found guilty by the Court of General Sessions, and\r\nfined £20.[565] More pressing matters engaged the attention of the\r\nauthorities for some time, and no further attention was given to this\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nNot even Pennsylvania was free from the custom. In 1710, the Indians\r\nmanifested some uneasiness, and when the governor sent a committee to\r\nlearn their wishes they returned eight wampum belts which represented\r\ntheir requests. One belt signified, so the Indians explained to\r\nthe committee, that their old women desired the friendship of the\r\nChristians and Indians of the government, and the privilege to fetch\r\nwood and water without danger and trouble; another, that their children\r\nmight have room to play and sport without danger of slavery. The young\r\nmen begged that they might be granted the privilege to hunt without\r\nfear of death or slavery; and the chiefs desired a lasting peace that\r\nthereby they might be secured against those “fearful apprehensions”\r\nthey had felt for several years.[566] A similar complaint was made by\r\nthe “Senoquois” to Lieutenant-Governor Gookin. The Indians asserted\r\nthat one Francis La Tore had taken a boy from them and had sold him\r\nin New York, and requested the lieutenant-governor to inquire about\r\nhim.[567]\r\n\r\nWhether or not actual kidnapping of the natives occurred in New York,\r\nat least the Indians were familiar with the custom as practiced by\r\nthe whites. The following is a case in point. When the Moravian\r\nmissionaries first visited New York, early in the eighteenth century,\r\nthe whites, in order to counteract the influence of Rauch, one of these\r\nmissionaries who was working at the Indian town of Shekomeka east of\r\nthe Hudson River, told the Indians of that section that the missionary\r\nintended to seize their young people, carry them beyond the seas and\r\nsell them into slavery.[568]\r\n\r\nEvents in New York illustrate another phase of Indian kidnapping.\r\nDuring the war between Spain and the United Netherlands prizes were\r\noccasionally brought by privateers to New Amsterdam from the Caribbean\r\nislands and the Spanish Main. Part of the cargoes of these vessels\r\nconsisted of kidnapped Spanish Indians. Their presence in the colony\r\nwas considered undesirable and their seizure generally unfair, for\r\nthey were in some cases of Spanish[569] as well as Indian blood. After\r\npeace was declared between Spain and the Netherlands, 1648, hostilities\r\nstill continued between Spain and France. To privateers flying the\r\nFrench flag, New Amsterdam was a neutral port where captive negroes and\r\nother prize goods were sold. Among these negroes was sometimes found a\r\nSpanish Indian. In 1692,[570] and again in 1699,[571] laws were passed\r\nto suppress privateering. But, despite these laws, the practice was\r\nadhered to, and the number of free Spanish Indians held in New York\r\nincreased. A petition to the governor of New York, in 1711, shows a\r\nfree Indian woman, a resident of Southampton, kidnapped and sold as a\r\nslave in Madeira, from whence she was returned by the English consul to\r\nNew York.[572] This instance illustrates the work of pirates also.\r\n\r\nMention is frequently found of Spanish Indians in other colonies,\r\nespecially in New England. Cotton Mather records buying a Spanish\r\nIndian and giving him to his father.[573] Mayhew mentions the death of\r\nChilmark, a Spanish Indian brought from some part of the Spanish Indies\r\nwhen he was a boy and sold in New England.[574] The New England and\r\nother newspapers contain frequent mention of Spanish Indian runaways\r\nand Spanish Indians for sale in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode\r\nIsland and Pennsylvania.[575] The _Boston News Letter_ of July 31,\r\n1704, and October 28, 1706, mentions both negro and Indian slaves taken\r\noff the coast of New Spain by privateers fitted out in South Carolina.\r\nIt may be that the so-called Spanish mulatto kidnapped by a privateer,\r\nsold in the colony of Pennsylvania and freed by the council in 1703,\r\nwas a Spanish Indian.[576]\r\n\r\nConsidering the prevalence of piracy and privateering during the\r\ncolonial period, it seems probable that there were not a few Spanish\r\nIndians brought to the different colonies in this way and in the\r\ncargoes of negroes from the West Indies and Brazil, whose existence\r\nin the colonies was never brought to the attention of the colonial\r\nauthorities.[577]\r\n\r\n“Kidnapping of Indians was contrary to express statute in most, if\r\nnot in all the colonies, and to the law of nations as generally\r\nrecognized in the international intercourse of Europeans with heathen\r\nand barbarian nations.”[578] There was considerable legislative action\r\nin the different colonies intended to check the practice, which\r\nhad, however, but little effect. In some of the colonies laws were\r\npassed intending to put an end to the practice by providing fines and\r\npenalties for the kidnapping of Indians. In other colonies legislative\r\nor executive action dealt, not with the custom in general, but with\r\ncertain specific events which aroused attention or were brought by\r\nsome one concerned directly to the notice of the legislative body or\r\nthe executive. One thing is apparent throughout all the legislation on\r\nthis subject: the absence of any particular sympathy for the Indian\r\nhimself. In some cases the Indian was only included incidentally or by\r\nimplication in a general law which made no specific mention of him.\r\nIn other cases laws against kidnapping were passed because of the\r\neffect that kidnapping might have on the Indians within or surrounding\r\nthe colony. In short, the motive was the desire for self-protection\r\ndictated by fear of disastrous results, rather than by any humanitarian\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that kidnapping concerned two classes of Indians,\r\nthose taken in English territory, and those taken in Spanish territory\r\nand brought to the English colonies. Colonial legislation and executive\r\naction included both classes.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia act of 1657 aimed directly at the stealing of Indian\r\nchildren by Indians who had been hired by the English. All such stolen\r\nchildren were to be returned to their own tribe within ten days, and\r\nfive hundred pounds of tobacco were to be paid by the offending party\r\nto the informer of such kidnapping.[579]\r\n\r\nIn 1672, the council of Maryland forbade the carrying of a certain\r\nfriendly Indian out of the colony without special license from the\r\ngovernor.[580] In 1692, for the sake of preserving peace with the\r\nneighboring Indians, a law was enacted forbidding any one to “entice,\r\nsurprise, transport, or cause to be transported, or sell or dispose\r\nof any friendly Indian or Indians whatsoever, or endeavor or attempt\r\nso to do, without license from the governor for the time being,” and\r\noffering a reward to any informer of such an event.[581] The same law\r\nwas reënacted in 1705.[582]\r\n\r\nArticle ninety-one of the Massachusetts Body of Liberties of 1641\r\nprovided that no one except captives taken in just wars etc. should be\r\nheld as slaves in the colony.[583] In 1649, the Body of Liberties was\r\nreënforced by a law decreeing: “If any man stealeth a man or mankind,\r\nhe shall surely be put to death.”[584] Some attention was given to\r\nenforcing this law, for the records show an occasional imprisonment\r\nfor stealing Indians.[585] On July 4, 1667, the governor of Barbadoes\r\nsent back to Massachusetts two Indians that had been taken to England\r\nand then carried to Barbadoes and sold as slaves. In an accompanying\r\naddress to the governor and assistants of Massachusetts he promised to\r\nrectify all such abuses that might come under his jurisdiction.[586]\r\nBut in spite of laws and precautions the practice of kidnapping\r\ncontinued throughout the colonial period.\r\n\r\nOther colonies followed the example of Massachusetts in making\r\nman-stealing a capital crime. New Jersey, in 1675,[587] and New\r\nHampshire, in 1679,[588] enacted similar laws. Just how far the\r\nlaws were intended to relate to kidnapped Indians is a matter for\r\nconjecture. They were in all probability intended to apply to the\r\nstealing of negro slaves, and there is nothing in their content to show\r\nthat they were intended to relate also to the stealing of free Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                    +Processes of Enslavement: Trade+\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all sections where captives in war or kidnapped Indians were\r\npurchased from the natives, such buying was closely connected with\r\nthe fur trade. The general fickleness and instability of the Indian’s\r\ncharacter, which caused the tribes to change their allegiance so\r\nreadily from one white race to the other, made easy the acquisition of\r\nslaves along with other commodities. The routes along which the fur\r\ntrade was carried on facilitated both the acquisition of Indians and\r\ntheir transportation to the markets. And the fact that furs and the\r\nagricultural products of the south were not commodities that competed\r\nwith English wares eliminated opposition to the traffic in Indians.[589]\r\n\r\nThroughout the region of the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes\r\nthe “coureurs de bois” collected furs and purchased slaves,[590] both\r\nof which they sold to Carolina traders at the mouth of the Mississippi\r\nRiver, and in some cases they went to the Carolinas directly to effect\r\ntheir sales.[591] Throughout the Carolinas, the Mississippi and\r\nIllinois country and the west, the fur and Indian trade was heavy. By\r\n1720 the Carolina fur trade had reached very large dimensions, and the\r\ntrade in Indians had developed proportionally, so that at “set times\r\nof the year” a flourishing business in “dressed deer skins, furs and\r\nyoung Indian slaves” was carried on by the traders.[592]\r\n\r\nIn the Carolinas the custom of purchasing their prisoners from\r\nthe friendly Indians, the holding of these captives in the colony\r\nas slaves, or, possibly, their subsequent sale to the West India\r\nislands, existed almost from the beginning of the colony.[593] But\r\nthe proprietors, anxious to cultivate the friendship of the Indians,\r\nforbade, in the temporary laws sent out to Governor Sayle in 1671, that\r\nany Indian on any pretext whatever be made a slave, or without his own\r\nconsent be carried out of the country.[594]\r\n\r\nYet the traffic in Indians continued. The adventurous nature of the\r\nsettlers,[595] combined with the need for laborers which could be\r\npartially supplied by the use of Indians at home or by the negroes for\r\nwhom they could be readily exchanged in the islands, and coupled with\r\nthe attraction of good prices which the Indians brought when sold for\r\ncash, induced both planters and government officials to enter largely\r\ninto the trade.\r\n\r\nTo supply the ever-increasing demand for Indian slaves, the tribes of\r\nthe south and southwest constantly preyed upon each other. The matter\r\nof international rivalry also entered largely into the policy of the\r\nCarolinians. The Indians of the south and west were divided in their\r\nallegiance to the three white races, Spanish, French and English. Each\r\nof these three nations sought not only to win and hold the allegiance\r\nof as many of the tribes as possible, but also to use these tribes\r\nto strike at its rival’s allies, and the readiness with which the\r\nEnglish, especially, bought the captives for slaves served to keep up a\r\ncontinuous series of depredations of tribe upon tribe.[596]\r\n\r\nThe Westo, an important tribe on the southern border of South\r\nCarolina, furnished a number of such captives during the latter part\r\nof the eighteenth century in spite of their two treaties made with\r\nthe proprietors, 1677 and 1678, in which they promised not to prey\r\nupon the smaller and weaker tribes who were friends and allies of the\r\nEnglish.[597] In 1693, the Cherokee sent a delegation to Governor Smith\r\nof South Carolina to complain of the Esaw, Congaree, and Savannah\r\nwho were preying upon those tribes and selling the captives thus\r\nobtained as slaves to the English. The Savannah, like the Westo, were\r\nso acting in violation of their treaty by which they agreed not to\r\nmolest neighboring tribes.[598] In 1706, English Indian allies attacked\r\nPensacola and carried off members of the Apalachee tribe for sale as\r\nslaves.[599] On July 10, 1708, Thomas Maine, an agent of the general\r\nassembly of South Carolina, reported to that body that the Talapoosa\r\nand the Chickasaw, incited by the good prices which the traders offered\r\nthem for captives, were engaged in making slaves of the Indians on the\r\nlower Mississippi who were subject to the French. In this instance one\r\nfinds the usual excuse given by the English in such cases: “some men\r\nthink it both serves to lessen their number before the French can arm\r\nthem, and it is a more effective way of civilizing and instructing them\r\nthan all the efforts used by the French missionaries”.[600]\r\n\r\nThe French asserted that the policy of the English of Carolina in\r\nsetting one Indian tribe against another was a part of their plan\r\nfor driving the French from Louisiana and the Mississippi River\r\ncountry.[601] The process of obtaining Indian slaves through trade was,\r\nthen, a part of a great political contest. The alliance of the leading\r\ntribes, such as the Chickasaw and the Choctaw, meant much to both\r\nEnglish and French from the territorial and the commercial standpoints.\r\nIn consequence, no effort was spared by either of the white races to\r\nobtain a dominating influence over these tribes in order to use them\r\nfor their own benefit. This benefit consisted largely of the gain in\r\ntrade both in furs and slaves. The French sought to dissolve this\r\nfriendship by telling the Chickasaw that the English were only seeking\r\nto destroy them by having them wage war for slaves, and that when they\r\nwere sufficiently weakened by war the English would fall upon them and\r\nsell them all as slaves.[602]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the unstable nature of the Indian and the influence\r\nbrought to bear upon the tribes by both French and English, it was\r\nbut natural that Indian relations in the section east of the lower\r\nMississippi should be kaleidoscopic in character.[603] As each tribe\r\ngave, or refused to give, allegiance to the English it was in turn\r\npreyed upon by the English allies. If one is to accept the assertions\r\nof the French in the early eighteenth century, the Chickasaw during\r\ntheir eight or ten years intercourse with the English lost five hundred\r\nprisoners, and the Choctaw, eight hundred, sold as slaves by the\r\nEnglish.[604]\r\n\r\nThe opening of the War of the Spanish Succession increased the activity\r\nof both English and French among the Indians and the consequent\r\npreying of tribe upon tribe. The French asserted that they established\r\ntheir colony at Mobile for the purpose of keeping the savages of the\r\nneighborhood as allies of the French and Spanish against the English\r\nand Chickasaw whose purpose, in their opinion, was to win them over or\r\nelse destroy them by enslavement.[605] By 1700 the English of Carolina\r\nhad crossed the Mississippi River and on the west bank pursued the\r\nsame tactics with the Indians as elsewhere.[606] Slaves were obtained\r\nby the English and Chickasaw from nations as far distant as the\r\nTaensa.[607] In furtherance of their scheme to win the friendship of\r\nthe warlike Chickasaw, and so strike a blow at the English and protect\r\ntheir allies from the slave raids of the former, the French repeatedly\r\nsought to make peace between the Chickasaw and Choctaw.[608] But the\r\nEnglish influence was too strong for such a peace to be permanent so\r\nlong as the Choctaw remained allies of the English. The peace arranged\r\nby Bienville in 1703 was broken in 1705 by the Chickasaw making an\r\nirruption into the territory of the Choctaw, capturing a number of\r\ntheir people and selling them to the English of Carolina.[609] A later\r\npeace arranged by Bienville was no more permanent, for in 1711 the\r\nChickasaw, at the instigation of the English, fell upon the Choctaw\r\nand word was brought to Bienville that three hundred Choctaw women and\r\nchildren had been carried off as slaves by the Indian allies of the\r\nEnglish and Chickasaw, and that the Chickasaw themselves had carried\r\noff one hundred and fifty.[610] By 1713 English traders and agents were\r\namong the Natchez Indians to purchase Indians whom the French accused\r\nthem of obtaining by exciting the tribes against each other.[611]\r\n\r\nIn their relations with the Indians the Carolina proprietors appear to\r\nhave been playing a double game. They posed as protectors of the tribes\r\nand made treaties to insure the peace and safety of their allies.\r\nConsistently with such action, also, they opposed the purchase by the\r\ncolonists of captives taken in various intertribal difficulties. On\r\nthe other hand, it was the proprietors themselves who gave permission\r\nto sell in the West Indies the Indian captives taken by the colonists\r\nin wars against the tribes.[612] The distinction, if any existed,\r\nbetween the classes of captives obtained in various ways and held as\r\nslaves, was too fine a one for the colonists to appreciate; hence the\r\npurchase and sale of Indians continued.\r\n\r\nIn short, the whole attitude of the proprietors on the subject came\r\nprimarily from jealousy for the colonial officials, and not from\r\nfeelings of humanity or sympathy with the Indians. They opposed any\r\naction of the colonial officials which tended to make them independent\r\nof the proprietors’ authority. This explains why they removed the\r\ndeputies, Mathews, Moore and Middleton, and Governor West, also, in\r\n1683, for selling Indians to the West Indies.[613] News, in fact, had\r\nreached the proprietors that the dealers in Indians were the “greatest\r\nsticklers” against having the parliament elected according to the\r\nproprietors’ instructions, so drastic measures were necessary. The\r\nfact that the proprietors chose to succeed West, Sir John Yeamans, a\r\nman filled with the slave sentiment of Barbadoes,[614] is sufficient\r\nevidence that they entertained no hostile feelings against the system\r\nof slavery in general.\r\n\r\nA secondary reason for the opposition of the Carolina proprietors to\r\nIndian slavery lay in the fact that the stirring up of the tribes by\r\nthe colonists in order to obtain captives for slaves resulted in danger\r\nand damage to the colony, which necessarily meant financial loss to\r\nthe proprietors. To carry out the idea of protecting the Indians,\r\nthe grand council, in accordance with previous instructions from\r\nits superiors, sent two agents to visit the plantations in 1680 and\r\nbring to Charleston all Indian slaves whom the Westo had sold to the\r\nplanters. These slaves were set at liberty.[615] In the same year, the\r\nproprietors appointed a commission to prevent the trade in Indians and\r\nto decide all cases arising in future between Indians and English.[616]\r\nThe commission proved a failure and was abolished in 1682 on the ground\r\nthat it was used for the oppression instead of the protection of the\r\nnatives.[617]\r\n\r\nThe proprietors continued their directions to the governors regarding\r\nthe sale of Indians. On May 10, 1682, they instructed Governor Joseph\r\nMoreton that upon no pretense or reason whatsoever was he to suffer\r\nany Indian to be sent away from Carolina, asserting that they had\r\ntaken into their protection as subjects of England all the Indians\r\nwithin four hundred miles of Charleston. Hence the Indians must not\r\nbe made slaves in war, or in any way injured by the colonists without\r\nproprietary permission.[618] Additional instructions, September 30,\r\n1683, forbade the governor and council to allow the transportation\r\nof any Indians without the consent of the parliament, and gave the\r\npalatine’s court, to be assembled by the governor and council for the\r\npurpose, the privilege of proposing such an act to the parliament.\r\nAny officer commissioned by the council or chosen by the palatine’s\r\ncourt who transported Indians without a license was to be at once\r\ndismissed.[619]\r\n\r\nA battle royal was now on between the proprietors, with perhaps a\r\nsmall number of sympathizers in the parliament, on the one hand, and\r\nthe council and traders on the other. The proprietors made inquiries\r\nregarding the selling of Indians both from the council and from private\r\nindividuals.[620] In a letter, September 30, 1686, also, they set\r\nforth their dissatisfaction with the condition of affairs and asserted\r\ntheir belief that “the private gains made by some by buying slaves\r\nof the Indians had more to do with the opinion that they ought to be\r\ntransported than any consideration of public safety or benefit.”[621]\r\n\r\nThe dealers in Indians stated three reasons for the traffic: that the\r\nSavannah, having united all their tribes, had become so powerful that\r\nit was dangerous to disoblige them; that South Carolina was at war\r\nwith the Waniah in which the Savannah assisted; that humanity decreed\r\nthe buying of their slaves to keep them from “a cruel death”. These\r\nreasons for the traffic were held by the proprietors to be unsound.\r\nThey declared the buying of slaves from the Savannah alone, and the\r\nforbidding of such buying from the other Indians would serve not only\r\nto keep the Savannah united, but would join the other tribes to them\r\nand so strengthen them that they would be a danger to the colony. The\r\nwar with the Waniah, they thought, had been the result of a quarrel\r\nthat the whites picked for the purpose of obtaining Indians to\r\ntransport. If the Savannah were to take captive the Waniah and sell\r\nthem to the dealers in Indians, it was only to those few dealers who\r\nhad a share in the government. These dealers had resorted to subterfuge\r\nin order to force the Savannah to sell only to them. The emissaries of\r\npeace sent by the Westo and the Waniah to the Savannah, declared the\r\nproprietors, had been seized by the last named and sold to the dealers,\r\nthus prolonging both the Waniah and the Westo wars, and likely to\r\ncause other wars. By purchasing slaves from the Savannah, also, these\r\nIndians were encouraged to make raids upon their weaker neighbors.\r\nSuch activities when discussed in England prevented settlers from\r\ngoing to South Carolina, fearing lest the runaway negroes could not be\r\nbrought back on so large a continent unless the Indians were preserved.\r\nFinally, said the proprietors, God’s blessing could not be expected on\r\na government so managed.[622]\r\n\r\nThe proprietors, however, did not wish to forbid the selling of\r\nIndians. They recognized the usefulness, as West had done, of\r\npermitting “soldiers for their encouragement, to make the best\r\nadvantage that they can out of their prisoners”; but they wanted the\r\ninitiative in the matter to rest with themselves. Accordingly they\r\nauthorized the parliament to pass acts for the exportation of “such\r\nIndians as they should decide upon”, the said Indians to be shown in\r\nthe house and examined by sworn interpreters as to their capture, name\r\nand station. The license issued by the parliament was to specify the\r\nperson to whom the leave of exportation was granted. The decision of\r\nthe parliament was to be rendered by a majority of the house. This\r\nlicense was not granted by a standing order, but for “each batch”.\r\nAnyone exporting Indians without such a license was to receive the\r\nutmost punishment prescribed by law.[623]\r\n\r\nDuring his administration, John Archdale, consistent with his religious\r\npersuasion of Quaker and his political position of proprietor, did what\r\nhe could to check the traffic in Indians. In 1695, a party of Yamasee\r\n(English Indians) fell upon a party of Spanish Indians not far from St.\r\nAugustine, took them prisoners and brought them to Charleston for sale\r\nto the English islands as slaves. On examining the captives and finding\r\nthat they were Christians, Archdale ordered the chief of the Yamasee\r\nto return them to the Spanish governor. The difficulty of restraining\r\nIndian tribes from revenging themselves upon their enemies and selling\r\ntheir captives as slaves, Archdale himself records.[624]\r\n\r\nIn 1700, James Moore forced the council to annul the election of\r\nMoreton as governor, and was himself chosen for the office. He then\r\npacked council and assembly with his associates and followers. These\r\npersons at once proceeded to use their offices for their own financial\r\nbenefit, and one of the means practiced to that end was the selling of\r\nIndians to the islands of the West Indies. Moore issued commissions to\r\npersons to capture all the Indians they could for his own profit.[625]\r\nAt his instigation the Apalachee attacked the missions of Santa\r\nCatalina, on the island of that name off the coast of the present\r\nstate of Georgia, and the mission of Santa Fé in Florida, burned the\r\nvillages, massacred many Christian Indians and carried off others to be\r\nsold as slaves in Carolina.[626] The members of the assembly and other\r\ninhabitants of the colony, June 26, 1705, complained to the proprietors\r\nof Moore’s enslaving Indians, not on the grounds of justice and\r\nhumanity, but of expediency. His action was ruining the Indian trade by\r\ncreating confusion among the Indians, and would, they feared, arouse\r\nan Indian war.[627] The proprietors denounced the governor but did not\r\nstop the practice.\r\n\r\nBy 1707 the activities of the traders in Indian slaves had become so\r\nnotorious that the South Carolina assembly took up the consideration\r\nof means to remedy the matter. A board of commissioners, nine in\r\nnumber, was appointed to have entire charge of the subject. By them it\r\nwas declared that one condition of a trader’s license and bond should\r\nprovide against the seizure of free Indians. Provision was also made\r\nfor the appointment of Indian agents with residence (except a vacation\r\nof two months) among the Indians, said agents to give a bond of £200\r\nand receive a yearly salary of £250. Their term of office was limited\r\nto one year.[628] But conditions became worse after the appointment of\r\nthe board than before.[629] Indian slaves were constantly brought to\r\nCharleston and sold openly in the market place. Unprincipled men were\r\ngranted trading privileges and made Indian agents.[630] A report on the\r\ncondition of the colony in 1708 shows that these slaves were sold in\r\nBoston, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia and the West\r\nIndies.[631]\r\n\r\nIt was the purpose of the assembly to have the board regulate the trade\r\nand keep it in the hands of the government. Its agents were required\r\nto take the following oath: “I, A. B., do promise and declare that I\r\nwill well and truly observe and perform all the powers, orders and\r\ninstructions, as shall be from time to time given or sent to me by\r\nthe present commissioners, and that I will not embezzle or make away\r\nwith any goods, wares, merchandise, skins, furs, slaves, or other good\r\nor liquors whatsoever, that shall be entrusted or given in charge to\r\nme or come into my hands, belonging to the public, and that I will not\r\ndirectly or indirectly trade with any Indian whatsoever for any skins,\r\nfurs or slaves, but for the sole use of the public; and that I will\r\nkeep secret and not divulge the debates and resolutions of this Board,\r\nso help me God.”[632]\r\n\r\nFurther directions required that the agents buy no male slaves above\r\nthe age of fourteen years;[633] that they should “not buy knowingly any\r\nfree Indian for a slave, nor make a slave of any Indian that ought to\r\nbe free, that is to say, an Indian of any nation that is in amity and\r\nunder the protection of this government”;[634] and that they should\r\nnot buy an Indian as slave until such had been at least three days in\r\nthe town of the warrior who had captured him.[635] Any Indian trader\r\nwho, by his own confession or by verdict of a jury, should be found\r\nguilty of selling any free Indian as a slave, at any time after the\r\nratification of this act, should forfeit the sum of £60 current money\r\nof the province, and failing to pay such fine, was to receive such\r\ncorporal punishment as the judges of a General Session might decree,\r\nnot extending to life or limb; and upon conviction for such offense the\r\nIndian slave so sold was declared free. The directions further urged\r\nthe agents to aim constantly to promote peace and good will among all\r\nnations of Indians with whom South Carolina was accustomed to trade,\r\nand to engage as many others as possible to embrace the friendship and\r\namity of the English.[636]\r\n\r\nIn the enactment of these measures it was not the purpose of the\r\nassembly to stop the traffic in Indians, but only to regulate it by\r\npreventing the illegal acquisition of Indians by the traders and by\r\nrequiring the traders to dispose of their Indians to the board itself\r\nwhich would then sell the Indians as it chose.[637] Their action\r\nwas dictated by a double purpose: to prevent the traders kidnapping\r\nIndians belonging to the tribes friendly to the colony and so bring\r\non dangerous Indian uprisings; and to obtain the profits of the trade\r\nfor the colonial exchequer, which not infrequently meant for their\r\nown profit. Humanitarian feeling for the Indians played no part in\r\ntheir action. The matter was made more complicated by the governor\r\nneglecting to sustain the action of the assembly. The explanation of\r\nhis attitude is not difficult. He was accustomed to obtain substantial\r\nperquisites from the sale of Indians. Valuable gifts were presented him\r\nby the traders for allowing them to remain unmolested. On one occasion\r\nGovernor Nathan Johnson refused £200 offered by the assembly for his\r\nIndian perquisites.[638]\r\n\r\nAs already observed, the check on the traders by the creation of the\r\nboard of commissioners was so slight that they continued as before to\r\ntraffic in Indians with impunity. Unprincipled traders were licensed\r\nand obtained Indians wherever and however they could. Some traders went\r\nso far as to keep a body of slaves with them in the Indian nation where\r\nthey traded, whom they sent out to attack other tribes for the purpose\r\nof obtaining captives.[639] Attempts, of course, were made by the board\r\nto check the traffic. At its meetings Indian agents were tried for\r\nillegally reducing Indians to slavery,[640] and on one occasion it was\r\nordered that a woman and child should be brought back from New York\r\nwhere they had been sold as slaves.[641] In 1711, an attempt was made\r\nto check the practice of the traders employing Indian slaves in the\r\nmanner above mentioned, by issuing the following order to all traders:\r\n“You shall permit none of your slaves to go to war on any account\r\nwhatsoever.”[642] This order had as little effect as those which\r\npreceded it. The influence of the traders, indeed, among the friendly\r\ntribes could accomplish the same result by stirring them up against\r\nother tribes.[643]\r\n\r\nThese and other efforts at regulation of the Indian slave trade\r\nwere alike fruitless. The general weakness of the province made it\r\nimpossible to control the action of the traders on the frontier and\r\noutside the boundary of the province. Reports to the English Board of\r\nTrade made frequent mention of the state of affairs but conditions were\r\nnot remedied.[644] On October 27, 1720, several merchants suggested\r\nto the Board of Trade, as a means of improving conditions in South\r\nCarolina, “to prohibit by still greater penalties the selling as a\r\nslave of any person of the nations in amity with us throughout the\r\ncontinent and to prevent abuse therein”, and declaring that “none but\r\ndeputies from the public should have power to buy Indian slaves from\r\nthose Indians in alliance with us as taken in war, which deputies on\r\npublic account should be obliged to transfer them to the Islands there\r\nto be sold on condition not to be sent to the province again”.[645]\r\n\r\nBut the provincial authorities could not enforce these decrees, so\r\nthe action of the traders continued unmolested until checked by other\r\ncauses. Government officials continued to league with the traders. As\r\nlate as 1754, a Catawba trader wrote to the board of commissioners as\r\nfollows: “The Catawbas held a council yesterday in the king’s house,\r\nand have resolved to go with the English against the French. They want\r\nme and my people to go with them, and we are willing to do so, even\r\nwithout pay, on one condition: that we be allowed to keep as our own\r\nproperty whatever plunder in the way of Indian slaves we may be able\r\nto capture.” There are frequent intimations in the records that Indian\r\nslaves were still being held in South Carolina at this time, though\r\ntheir wholesale delivery and sale in Charleston had ceased.[646]\r\n\r\nIn Virginia trade with the Indians began at an early date, and\r\nthe traffic in Indians became later a part of it.[647] The French\r\nreported, in 1701, that the English from Virginia, established among\r\nthe Chickasaw, had armed the savages with guns, joined with them in\r\ntheir expeditions against other people, especially the “Colipissas”\r\n(Acolapissa), and had sent the prisoners to be sold as slaves in the\r\nWest Indies, keeping the children as slaves for themselves.[648]\r\n\r\nFor some time the Virginia authorities did not recognize the right of\r\nthe whites to enslave an Indian, no matter how obtained. In the session\r\nof 1657–1658, the assembly passed an act forbidding the stealing of\r\nIndian children or the buying of them from Indians or others for\r\ntraffic, or the selling of them under any condition by the English, on\r\npenalty of 500 pounds of tobacco.[649] In 1662, the assembly passed\r\nan act declaring that if any Englishman should bring in any Indians\r\nas servants and assign them to any one else he should not sell them\r\nas slaves or for any longer time than English servants of like age\r\nshould serve by act of assembly.[650] The assembly evidently intended\r\nto enforce these acts, for in the session of 1662 it ordered a Powhatan\r\nIndian to be freed who had been sold to the English by the chief of\r\nanother tribe who, according to the assembly, had no right thus to sell\r\nhim.[651]\r\n\r\nBy 1670 the assembly appears to have modified in a measure its opinion\r\nregarding Indian slaves. An act of that year declared Indians taken\r\nin war by any other nation and sold by such nation to the English to\r\nbe servants for life, if brought in by sea—if boys or girls, till\r\nthirty years old; if men or women, twelve years and no longer.[652]\r\nBy a later act of 1682 the legislature repealed the act of 1670 and\r\ndefinitely decided who should be slaves. Among those specified were all\r\nIndians obtained by purchase, in case they and their parents were not\r\nChristians at the time of their first being purchased by a Christian,\r\nalthough afterwards and before their importation into Virginia, they\r\nmight have become converted to the Christian faith; and all Indians\r\nthereafter sold by the neighboring Indians or any other trafficking\r\nin slaves. But in 1691 these acts in turn were repealed and after\r\nthat date no Indian could legally be bought or sold as a slave in\r\nVirginia.[653]\r\n\r\nLegislation, however, did not end the bringing of Indian slaves\r\ninto the colony. Lawson records the sale in Virginia before 1700\r\nof a young Indian woman brought from beyond the mountains.[654] In\r\n1715, the Carolina settlers reported to the home government that\r\nthe Sarrow Indians were selling in Virginia among other commodities\r\nslaves (presumably Indian as well as negro) taken from the Carolina\r\ncolonists.[655]\r\n\r\nYet the Indian slaves brought into Virginia through the process of\r\ntrade were never so numerous as in the Carolinas or the New England\r\ncolonies, because the trade of Virginia with the Indian country was\r\nnever so extensive as that of the Carolinas, or with the Carolinas\r\nso extensive as that of New England. Neither was the industry of the\r\nVirginia colonists in the early days such as to require Indian slaves\r\nfrom the traders. The export trade was largely carried on with the\r\nmother country instead of with the colonies. The whole system of trade\r\nwas not conducive to traffic in Indians.\r\n\r\nIn New England there was no direct traffic with the Indian tribes such\r\nas existed in the south. Instead, Indian slaves were obtained by trade\r\nwith the other colonies, notably the Carolinas. Commerce of this sort,\r\nabundant evidence of which is furnished by the newspapers of the time,\r\nflourished from the opening of the eighteenth century[656] until some\r\ntime after the Tuscarora War.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts the number of Indians imported from the south\r\nincreased so rapidly that the colonial authorities feared certain\r\ndisastrous effects upon the colony from their presence. Accordingly,\r\nAugust 23, 1712, an act was passed, the preamble of which set forth\r\nfour reasons for its enactment: the Indian slaves imported from the\r\nsouth were “malicious, surly and revengeful”; the industry of the\r\ncolony was unlike that of the West Indies; with savage enemies at hand,\r\nit was dangerous to have bondsmen of a kindred race; the influx of the\r\nslaves discouraged the importation of Christian servants. Accordingly\r\nit was forbidden to import “any Indian, male or female, by land or sea\r\nfrom any part or place whatever, to be disposed of, sold or left within\r\nthe province”, on pain of forfeit to her Majesty’s government, unless\r\nthe offender “importing such Indians give security at the Secretary’s\r\noffice at £50 per head, to transport or carry out the same again within\r\nthe space of one month next after their coming in, not to be returned\r\nback to this province”. It was also provided that the captain or\r\ncommander of any ship bringing such Indians into the province should,\r\nwithin twenty-four hours after the arrival of such ship, report the\r\nnames, number and sex of such Indians, and give security of £50, under\r\npenalty of £50 for neglect to do so.[657]\r\n\r\nOn December 28, 1725, Massachusetts passed an act regarding the\r\nexportation of Indians. This measure, like that of 1712, was not\r\nhumanitarian but self-protective. The act forbade the carrying of any\r\nIndian out of the province except by legal authority, or on condition\r\nof giving £100 security for the safe return of such Indian, due\r\nallowance being made for unforeseen exigencies.[658]\r\n\r\nNew Haven, also, in 1656, passed a general law ordering that no person\r\nshould sell “any servant male or female of what degree soever”, out\r\nof the colony unless into some of the other three colonies belonging\r\nto the New England Confederation, without leave and license from the\r\nauthorities of that plantation to which such servant belonged, under\r\npenalty of a fine of £10 for each offense.[659] The measure could be\r\napplied to Indian slaves, though not intended specifically for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAfter the Tuscarora War the importation of “revengeful, warlike\r\nsavages” alarmed the Connecticut colonists and led to definite\r\nlegislative action regarding the matter. In view of the fact that\r\nseveral persons had brought into the colony Carolina Indians, “which\r\nhave committed many cruel and bloody outrages” there, and “may draw\r\noff our Indians” to the extent of arousing hostilities if their\r\nimportation were continued, in July, 1715, the governor and council\r\ndecided to prohibit the importation of Indian slaves until the meeting\r\nof the assembly, and to require each ship entering port with Indians\r\non board to give a bond of £50 to remove them from the colony within\r\ntwenty days. Further they decided that Indians brought into the colony\r\nthereafter should be “kept in strictest custody”, and “prevented from\r\ncommunicating with other Indians”, unless the owner gave the same bond\r\nas above to take them out of the colony within twenty days.[660]\r\n\r\nThe following October, the general court, copying the Massachusetts\r\nact of 1712, made permanent the prohibition to import Indian slaves,\r\nsince “divers conspiracies, outrages, barbarities, murders, burglaries,\r\nthefts, and other notorious crimes at sundry times, and especially of\r\nlate, have been perpetrated by Indians and other slaves, ... being of\r\na malicious and vengeful spirit, rude and insolent in their behavior,\r\nand very ungovernable, the overgreat number of which, considering the\r\ndifferent circumstances in this colony from the plantations in the\r\nislands and our having considerable numbers of Indians, natives of our\r\ncountry, ... may be of pernicious consequence.” An act was then passed\r\ndecreeing the forfeiture of all Indians thereafter imported, and the\r\npayment of a fine of £50 by the shipmaster or any other person who\r\nmight bring them.[661] Since this act did not stop the importation,\r\nanother was enacted in 1750 providing that “all Indians, male or\r\nfemale, of what age soever, imported or brought into this colony by\r\nsea or land, from any place whatever, to be disposed of, left or sold\r\nwithin this colony, shall be forfeited to the treasury of this colony,\r\nand may be seized and taken accordingly; unless the person or persons\r\nimporting or bringing in such Indian or Indians shall give security\r\nto some naval officer of this colony of £50 per head, to transport or\r\ncarry out of the same again, within the space of one month after their\r\ncoming, not to be returned back again to this colony”.[662]\r\n\r\nA similar act passed in 1774 forbade the importation of Indian, negro\r\nor mulatto slaves. The act stated that the cause of this legislation\r\nwas the fact that the “increase of slaves in this colony is injurious\r\nto the poor and inconvenient”. Any person, therefore, importing Indian,\r\nnegro or mulatto slaves or knowingly bringing them as such, should\r\nforfeit to the treasurer of the colony the sum of £100 for each slave\r\nso imported or purchased.[663]\r\n\r\nRhode Island, in August, 1676, decreed that any person importing\r\nIndians into the colony without permission of the colonial authorities,\r\nshould forfeit all right to them and pay a fine of £5 to the colony.\r\nCertain persons allowed to import such Indians were directed to pay\r\nhalf the sum of the sale to the treasurer or forfeit the Indians; and\r\nall persons were forbidden to carry any Indians out of the colony\r\nwithout permission of the government, under penalty of £5.[664]\r\n\r\nAs a special measure of protection against internal disturbances,\r\nthe general assembly of Rhode Island, also, passed an act, January\r\n4, 1704, forbidding, under penalty of forfeiture, the importation of\r\nIndians either to be kept or sold. And if any person brought Indians\r\ninto the colony and set them at liberty under the pretense of bringing\r\nthem as servants, such person would have to carry such Indians out of\r\nthe colony at his own expense. If the person importing Indians failed\r\nto remove them, he should be seized by the authorities and dealt\r\nwith according to law, as should also the person having them in his\r\npossession.[665]\r\n\r\nThe Indian wars in the southern colonies brought the same action in\r\nRhode Island as in the other New England colonies. In July 5, 1715,\r\nan act was passed to prohibit the importation of Indian slaves.\r\nThe preamble of the act states that in both Rhode Island and the\r\nneighboring colonies, “conspiracies, insurrections, rapes, thefts and\r\nother execrable crimes” had been perpetrated by the Indian slaves, “and\r\nthe increase of them in this colony daily discourages the importing\r\nof white servants from Great Britain, etc., into this colony, which\r\nif not immediately remedied may prove very pernicious and troublesome\r\nto this government”. The act, therefore, provided that within three\r\nmonths after its publication, all Indians, male or female, of whatever\r\nage, brought by land or sea, from any part or place, to be disposed of,\r\nsold or left within the colony, should be forfeited to his majesty, for\r\nand toward the support of the colony, unless the person who brought\r\nin such Indian or Indians, should give security of £50 per head to\r\ncarry them out within the period of one month. All masters of ships,\r\nand others engaged in the traffic, were to record in the secretary’s\r\noffice within twenty-four hours after arrival the names, number and sex\r\nof the Indians and give security of £50 per head. Failure to meet this\r\nrequirement was to be punished by the confiscation of the Indians.[666]\r\nThis act was continued in force and was reënacted in the Digest of Laws\r\nin 1766.\r\n\r\nIn New Hampshire a law was passed in 1714 forbidding the importation\r\nor bringing into the province, by sea or land, of any male or female\r\nIndian to be used as a servant or a slave. This was done because\r\nof the fact that “notorious crimes or enormities have of late been\r\nperpetrated and committed by Indians or other slaves, within several of\r\nher Majesty’s plantations in America”, and because the use of Indian\r\nslaves was considered “a discouragement to Christian servants”.[667]\r\nBy the terms of the act, “Indians, male or female, of what age soever,\r\nthat shall be imported or brought into this province by sea or land,\r\nevery master of ship or other vessel, merchant or person, importing or\r\nbringing into this province such Indians, male or female, shall forfeit\r\nto her Majesty, for the support of the government, the sum of £10 per\r\nhead, to be sued for and recovered in any of her Majesty’s courts of\r\nrecord, ... to be paid into the treasury for the use of the aforesaid”.\r\nThe occasion for this act was the same as that for the Massachusetts\r\nact of 1712, namely, the bringing of southern Indian slaves to the\r\nnorthern colonies. The influence of Massachusetts is readily seen, for\r\nIndian slaves could not have been so numerous as to have been a serious\r\nmenace in a province of fewer than 10,000 inhabitants.[668]\r\n\r\nA part of the small number of Indian slaves in the colony of New York\r\ncame through the process of trade.[669] Indians from the Carolinas, for\r\nexample, were sold there.[670] Since New York took certain legislative\r\naction regarding other Indians but never considered the importation\r\nof the southern Indians, it may be concluded that the number imported\r\nduring the southern wars was never sufficiently large to cause any\r\nconcern in the colony. Probably very few, if any, came into the colony\r\nthrough direct trade with the Indians themselves.\r\n\r\nThough the number of Indians imported into Pennsylvania was also small,\r\nit was large enough to lead to legislation concerning it. January 12,\r\n1706, the general assembly passed an act to prevent the importation\r\nof Indian slaves from any other province or colony of America after\r\nMarch 25, 1706. The preamble of the act stated that the importation of\r\nIndians from Carolina and other places had given offense to the Indians\r\nof the province and caused them to become suspicious and dissatisfied.\r\nPerhaps a fellow feeling, or perhaps the fear that the custom of the\r\nwhites using Indian slaves might affect their liberty, led the Indians,\r\nalready in a state of disturbance, to protest against such importation.\r\nAt the same time, the act declared “that no such Indian slave, as\r\ndeserting his master’s service elsewhere shall fly into this province,\r\nshall be understood or construed to be comprehended within this act.”\r\nA further exception was made in the case of those slaves with their\r\nchildren who, for the space of one year before such importation, could\r\nbe proved to have been menial servants in the family of the importer.\r\nAny slave brought into the province contrary to this law was declared\r\nforfeited to the government, and was to be set free or otherwise\r\ndisposed of according to the will of the governor and council.[671]\r\n\r\nThe law of 1706 proved to be inadequate.[672] The continued importation\r\nof Indians and the still existing fear of having ungovernable and\r\ndangerous slaves in the colony, led to the passage in 1712 of a second\r\nact, already mentioned, which levied a duty of £20 on every negro\r\nor Indian imported.[673] Masters of vessels bringing them in were\r\nrequired to state their number and the name of the importer. Any negro\r\nor Indian in whose case these provisions were violated was to be seized\r\nand sold by provincial officers, and the money obtained from their sale\r\npaid to the treasurer for the use of the government. Duties paid upon\r\nany negro or Indian imported, but exported again within twenty days,\r\nhowever, were to be returned. One Samuel Holt was appointed to put the\r\nact into execution, and was given the necessary powers to use force,\r\nif necessary, to find concealed negroes and Indians whose owners had\r\nnot complied with the terms of the act, and to dispose in public sale\r\nof those so captured. Owners could bring back their runaway negro or\r\nIndian slaves, and “gentlemen and strangers” traveling in the province\r\nwere allowed to retain their negro or Indian slaves for a time not\r\nexceeding six months.[674] But the act was not put into operation, for\r\nit was repealed by the queen in council, February 20, 1714.[675]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                    +Other Processes of Enslavement+\r\n\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happened that the Indians sold to the whites, for a\r\nspecified number of years, members of their own tribe as a punishment\r\nfor some grievous offense.[676] Families sold some of their own members\r\ninto temporary servitude to obtain money or other necessities,[677] or\r\nan individual Indian offered himself or his children as security for\r\nloans, and, on failure to meet the obligations, became the slaves of\r\nthe creditors.[678] Occasionally an outcast or disgraced Indian, having\r\nlost his position in the family or the tribe, sold himself into slavery\r\nto the whites in order to escape punishment at the hands of his own\r\npeople and to secure future protection for himself.\r\n\r\nThe treachery of the whites in refusing to give up the Indians at the\r\nexpiration of the specified term of service, and the selling of them\r\nout of the country, caused considerable disturbance among the Indians\r\nin several colonies. In 1660, a company of English from Massachusetts\r\nsettled on Old Town Creek at its junction with Cape Fear River in\r\nthe present North Carolina. The settlement was short lived, lasting\r\nsomething less than three years. One reason why the settlers left was\r\nthe hostile attitude of neighboring Indians who believed that the white\r\nmen had shipped off as slaves some of the Indian children who had been\r\nentrusted to their care, under the pretext of sending them north to\r\nbe educated.[679] Though the charge has never been substantiated, it\r\nseems probable that it was not without cause. The lax state of morals\r\namong the early settlers would permit the kidnapping of Indians to be\r\npracticed by this little settlement as well as elsewhere. But whether\r\nthe settlers were guilty or not on this particular occasion, the\r\nincident throws a certain light on the custom of the times through the\r\nfear which the Indians showed of such treatment.[680] Evidently the\r\npractice continued in North Carolina, for one of the grievances of the\r\nTuscarora Indians at the breaking out of the Tuscarora War was that\r\ntheir children who had been bound out for a limited time in English\r\nfamilies, were, contrary to the spirit of the agreement, transported to\r\nother plantations and sold as slaves.[681]\r\n\r\nVirginia was always comparatively lenient in her treatment of the\r\nIndians. Accordingly, its early legislation dealt with the matter of\r\nunjustly forcing Indians into slavery. In 1655, provision was made that\r\nIndian children could become indentured servants only by consent of\r\ntheir parents and for specified terms agreed upon, and such children\r\nwere to be educated in the Christian religion.[682] The following\r\nyear, 1656, it was provided that Indian children brought into the\r\ncolony as hostages should be assigned to masters by choice of their\r\nparents, but should not be made slaves.[683] Again, in 1658, it was\r\ndecreed that any Indian children disposed of by their parents to a\r\nwhite man for “education and instruction in the Christian religion”,\r\nor for any other purpose, were not to be turned over to any other\r\nperson upon any pretext whatever, and any such child was to be free\r\nat the age of twenty-five.[684] The fact that the legislation on the\r\nsubject was repeated at such short intervals affords evidence of the\r\ncontinuance of the custom which it was intended to abolish. A letter\r\nof Governor Spotswood to Lord Dartmouth, March 11, 1711, regarding\r\nthe Indian college, tells of his attempt to persuade Indians to allow\r\ntheir children to attend the college by remitting their annual tribute\r\nof skins, and declares that “they were a little shy of yielding to his\r\nproposal, and urged the breach of a former contract made long ago by\r\nthis government, when instead of their children receiving the promised\r\neducation, they were transported, as they say, to other countries and\r\nsold as slaves”.[685]\r\n\r\nMassachusetts sought to control the custom of the Indians in\r\napprenticing themselves and their children to the whites and the\r\nconsequent abuse of the practice, by enacting, in 1700, a law requiring\r\nthe consent of two or more justices of the peace to such a proceeding,\r\nso as to make sure that the terms of the agreement were reasonable. The\r\njustices of the regular courts were empowered to hear the complaint of\r\nan Indian with regard to any indenture or apprenticeship, and to settle\r\nthe matter.[686] Similar acts were passed in 1718[687] and 1725.[688]\r\nThe latter act provided a heavy fine for taking any children beyond the\r\nseas without due legal sanction, and further decreed that any indenture\r\nthen existing of an adult Indian should be good for no longer than one\r\nyear from the date of the passage of the law, except by legal approval\r\nas specified in the law. In 1763, another act, to continue as law for\r\nthree years, was passed, forbidding any Marshpee Indian to bind out his\r\nor her child or children to any English person whatsoever by indenture\r\nor any other way, in satisfaction of or as security for a debt, without\r\nthe consent of the major part of the overseers, and declaring that\r\nevery indenture or any instrument whatever, or oral agreement whereby\r\nsuch child or children should be bound out contrary to the true intent\r\nand meaning of the act, should be adjudged null and void.[689]\r\n\r\nRhode Island, also, for the same purpose of preventing the conversion\r\nof apprenticeship into actual slavery, passed an act, June 15, 1730,\r\nrequiring the assent of two justices to any bond of apprenticeship to\r\nwhich the Indians were parties.[690] If the Indian captives disposed\r\nof for periods of years by Rhode Island at the close of King Philip’s\r\nWar are to be considered as involuntary indentured servants, then\r\nsuch abuses as the law of 1730 were intended to remedy existed with\r\nreference to those captives. By the terms of their disposal they were\r\nto be free after a temporary period of service. But the colonists\r\nsometimes continued to hold them in servitude after the specified term\r\nhad expired. Furthermore, though no provision for such action was made\r\nby the colonial government, the masters of these servants held as\r\nslaves the children born of these Indians while in servitude.[691]\r\n\r\nConditions in New York in the eighteenth century serve to illustrate\r\nthe same point. In July, 1715, Colonel Heathcote wrote home to\r\nSecretary Townsend: “The Indians complain that their children, who\r\nwere many of them bound out for a limited time to be taught and\r\ninstructed by the Christians, were, contrary to the intent of their\r\nagreement, transferred to other plantations and sold for slaves, and\r\nI don’t know but there may be some truth in what they allege”.[692]\r\nThe authorities were aware of the danger caused by the colonists’\r\naction, and in 1750 Governor Clinton ordered all Indian children held\r\nas pledges or slaves, to be returned to their families.[693] Johnson,\r\nthe Indian commissioner, was much pleased with the governor’s action\r\nand January 22, 1750, wrote him: “I am very glad that your excellency\r\nhas given orders to have the Indian children returned, who are kept\r\nby the traders as pawns or pledges as they call it, but rather stolen\r\nfrom them (as the parents came at the appointed time to redeem them,\r\nbut they sent them away before hand), and as they were children of\r\nour Friends and Allies, and if they are not returned next Spring,\r\nit will confirm what the French told the Six Nations (viz.): that we\r\nlooked upon them as slaves or negroes, which affair gave me a great\r\ndeal of trouble at that time to reconcile”. Evidently the holders were\r\ndisinclined to obey the governor’s order, for Johnson cited in his\r\nletter two cases where such return had not been made, and from which\r\nhe feared disturbance.[694] To what extent the governor’s decree was\r\neffective would be hard to state. There certainly were Indian slaves\r\nin the colony after its publication. “A list of the Negro, Indian and\r\nMulatto Slaves within the district whereof Benjamin Smith is Captain at\r\nHempstead in Queens County taken the first day of April, 1755,” shows\r\nthat Indian slaves were being used on Long Island at that date,[695]\r\nand it seems not unlikely that some of them might have been obtained by\r\nabuse of indenture.\r\n\r\nAnother process of enslaving Indians was that which had to do with the\r\ninfliction of punishment for offenses against law and order. The custom\r\nof sentencing Indians to enslavement at home, or to transportation\r\nand enslavement abroad, for such offenses was general throughout the\r\ncolonies. Such a sentence came about in one of two ways: either the\r\ncolonial legislature enacted a law which imposed enslavement as the\r\npunishment for a given offense; or a colonial court acting on its own\r\ninitiative used it to that end.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, even after the wholesale deportation of captive\r\nand kidnapped Indians for slaves had practically ceased, natives were\r\nsometimes sentenced to slavery by the assembly as punishment for crime\r\nof which the accused was convicted or suspected. Such an instance\r\noccurred, May 29, 1725, when it was “Ordered that Colonel Alexander\r\nParris, Public Receiver, do forthwith sell the Indian now in jail for\r\nthe supposed murder of a white man to the northward of the province,\r\nin order that he may be transferred to Bermuda, Jamaica or Barbadoes,\r\nor some other of the West India Islands.”[696] Again on May 31, 1732,\r\n“His Excellency having asked the advice of the Council in relation to\r\nan Indian delivered up by her own nation, now in jail of this town, on\r\nsuspicion of having murdered an Indian trader; it is resolved, that\r\nas it could not be fully proved that she was the person that murdered\r\nthe said Indian trader, but strong presumptions appearing ordered that\r\nColonel Parris cause her to be transported and sold, for the use of\r\nthe Publick.”[697] A similar instance occurred in Massachusetts in\r\n1666 when the general court sentenced a Pequot to slavery for life as\r\npunishment for the murder of a white colonist by the Indians.[698]\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, as a measure of protection to property rights upon a\r\ncomplaint of damages committed by Indians, the assembly voted in\r\n1660 that the plaintiff in the case be given the right, provided\r\nsatisfaction were not made, to sell as many Indians out of the country\r\nas the court might prescribe.[699] Another act of similar character\r\nwas passed in 1722 after the treaty of Albany, when the assembly voted\r\nthat no Virginia Indian should cross the Potomac River, and that none\r\nof the Five Nations or their allies should go beyond that boundary. Any\r\noffenders were to be punished by death, or be transported and sold as\r\nslaves.[700] In Massachusetts, also, the question of runaway slaves who\r\nsought refuge among the Indians, led the general court, June 2, 1641,\r\nto pass an order by which it was declared to be the mind of the court\r\n“that if the Indians send not back our runaways, then, by commission\r\nof the governor and any three of the magistrates, to send and take so\r\nmany as to satisfy for the want of them and for the charge of sending\r\nfor them”.[701] The order, like that of the Virginia legislature, meant\r\nthat any master might be authorized to right himself upon the Indians\r\nfor wrong done him by them.\r\n\r\nNot only the higher courts, but the lower courts as well, were\r\naccustomed to make use of this form of punishment. In 1678, the\r\ncourt of Sandwich, Plymouth, directed that three Indians convicted\r\nof breaking open a house and stealing therefrom, should be perpetual\r\nslaves, and empowered the owner of the house and stolen property to\r\n“make sale of them in New England or elsewhere, as his lawful slaves,\r\nfor the term of their lives.”[702]\r\n\r\nTheir love of strong drink not infrequently led the Indians into\r\ntemporary servitude, and served as a means by which the colonists, if\r\nso minded, could force them into that condition. On one occasion Boston\r\nwas building a fort on an island in the harbor. Wages were high and\r\neconomy was desirable. The general court, therefore, ordered that for\r\ndrunkenness the Indians should not be whipped, but sent to this island\r\nto work for ten days. The Indians protested and preferred whipping as\r\npunishment, but their complaint received no attention.[703]\r\n\r\nOn March 8, 1683, the Plymouth general court decreed that a certain\r\nIndian should serve as a slave for a specified time because of a\r\njudgment against him.[704] At a council held in Boston, also, June 14,\r\n1686, upon notification of the keeper of the prison that a sentence\r\nof transportation of an Indian had not been carried into effect, the\r\ntreasurer was ordered to sell the Indian for a period not exceeding\r\nseven years in satisfaction of the judgment against him.[705] The\r\nMassachusetts council records of January 18, 1695, tell of an Indian\r\naccused of “corresponding with and adhering to the Indian enemy” who\r\nwas transported and sold for the offense.[706] A similar instance\r\noccurred in 1696, when an Indian was condemned “to be transported\r\nbeyond the seas as a dangerous person and sold”.[707] On December\r\n1, 1705, the Massachusetts deputies sent in a bill providing that\r\nfornication or marriage of white men with negroes or Indians should\r\nbe punished by selling the colored offenders out of the colony as\r\nslaves. Through the intercession of Samuel Sewall, the Indians were\r\ndropped from the bill which was then passed as applying to blacks and\r\nmulattoes.[708] The records mention other instances in 1713[709] and\r\n1776[710] when Indians were sold as punishment for crime, the latter\r\ncase being one of theft. An incident occurred in 1721 when the sentence\r\nof an Indian imprisoned in Boston was changed from imprisonment to\r\na term of servitude.[711] Another Indian, in 1727, was sold for a\r\nterm of years to a resident of the colony to serve a sentence for\r\ndebt.[712] In 1739, on petition of the sheriff of Barnstaple county,\r\nthe Massachusetts general court impowered the justices of that county\r\nto sell an Indian prisoner convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to\r\nimprisonment “to any of his majesty’s good subjects for a term not\r\nexceeding ten years, for the most he will fetch”, in order to get money\r\nto pay the cost of prosecuting the prisoner and the charges of his\r\nimprisonment.[713]\r\n\r\nThe Indians of Rhode Island gave much trouble by stealing the goods\r\nand cattle of the colonists. To prevent it, a law was passed, 1659, to\r\nthe effect that, if the damage exceeded twenty shillings, the convict\r\nmight be sold as a slave to any English plantation abroad unless he\r\nmade restitution.[714] Instances are not lacking in which the law of\r\n1659 was put into effect. On one occasion (between 1671 and 1685) an\r\nIndian convicted of breaking into a house and of beating and wounding\r\na servant, was sentenced to pay a fine, or, if payment were not made\r\nin three months, to be sold as a slave in Barbadoes.[715] In 1676, the\r\ngeneral court provided that all Indians who should come upon any island\r\nin the bay, must have written permission so to do from the committee\r\nappointed to dispose of Indians, without which they would be liable to\r\nbe sold into servitude.[716]\r\n\r\nThe first code of Connecticut laws, 1650, followed the Massachusetts\r\nBody of Liberties in authorizing enslavement as a mode of\r\npunishment.[717] In 1650, certain Indians who failed to make\r\nsatisfaction for injuries were ordered to be seized and delivered to\r\nthe injured party, “either to serve or to be shipped out ... as the\r\ncase will justly bear”.[718] In 1660, the general court was empowered\r\nby the United Colonies to send a company of men to obtain satisfaction\r\nfrom the Narraganset for certain depredations upon the settlers. Four\r\nof the guilty Indians were to be demanded and sent to Barbadoes to be\r\nsold as slaves.[719]\r\n\r\nNot only did the New England colonies take separately such legislative\r\naction regarding the enslavement of Indians, but Plymouth,\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, and New Haven acting together as the New\r\nEngland Confederation, took similar action. Alleged trespassing of\r\nIndians upon English territory, and the fear of a Narraganset war,\r\nled the United Colonies, in 1646, to pass an order authorizing, upon\r\ncomplaint of trespass by Indians, the seizure of any of them who should\r\n“entertain, protect or rescue the offender”. “And because it will be\r\nchargeable keeping Indians in prison, and if they should escape, they\r\nare like to prove more insolent and dangerous after, that upon such\r\nseizure, the delinquent or satisfaction be demanded of the sagamore\r\nor plantation of Indians guilty or accessory as before, and if it be\r\ndenied, that the magistrates of the jurisdiction deliver up the Indians\r\nseized to the party or parties indamaged, either to serve or to be\r\nshipped out in exchange for negroes as the case will justly bear.”\r\nThe commissioners agreed that this measure, though just, was severe,\r\nand that it might lead to the Indians seizing the English in return;\r\nbut they could see no better means of preserving the peace of the\r\ncolony. As a measure of fairness, therefore, they decreed that before\r\nany seizure of Indians was made, a copy of the declaration should be\r\npublished and given to the particular sagamore. Copies were accordingly\r\ngiven to four leading sachems.[720]\r\n\r\nA further process of enslavement was connected with questions of birth.\r\nBy the recognized common law of nations, the civil law, and the Jewish\r\nlaw, the children of a slave mother became at birth the property of\r\nthe mother’s owner. Nobody thought of the children of slaves being\r\nfree. Yet, to make certainty doubly sure, the colonial laws from time\r\nto time considered the matter and declared the common law a part of\r\ncolonial legislation.[721] South Carolina, for example, by an act of\r\n1712,[722] repeated in 1722,[723] and 1735,[724] declared that, with\r\nthe exception of certain individuals freed by the government, “all\r\nnegroes, mulattoes, mustizoes, or Indians which at any time heretofore\r\nhave been sold, or now are held or taken to be, or hereafter shall be\r\nbought and sold as slaves, are hereby declared slaves; and they and\r\ntheir children, are hereby made and declared slaves to all intents and\r\npurposes.” Another act of 1740, though worded differently, decreed a\r\nsimilar condition for the children of negro, mulatto, mustee and Indian\r\nslave mothers.[725] In 1705, Virginia similarly declared all children\r\nbond or free according to the condition of their mothers;[726] and,\r\nin 1723, decreed that children of female mulattoes or Indians obliged\r\nby law to serve till the age of thirty or thirty-one should serve the\r\nmaster or mistress of such mulatto or Indian until they should attain\r\nthe same age as that up to which the mother was obliged by law to\r\nserve.[727]\r\n\r\nA Maryland act of 1663 differs from the acts just mentioned by stating\r\nthat “all children born of any negro or other slave, shall be slaves\r\nas their fathers were for the term of their lives.” Another section\r\nof this same act provides that “whatsoever freeborn woman shall\r\nintermarry with any slave, from and after the last day of the present\r\nassembly, shall serve the master of such slave during the life of her\r\nhusband; and that all the issue of such free-born woman, so married,\r\nshall be slaves as their fathers were.”[728] Though the law was of\r\nbrief duration, persons born of the union between slaves and free\r\nwhite women, and the descendants of such persons, were held in slavery\r\ndown to 1791, when the highest court of the state decided that for\r\nwant of proof concerning the white woman who originally married a\r\nslave, her descendants were not slaves, and could not be legally held\r\nas such.[729] A later Maryland act, June 2, 1692, provided that all\r\nchildren born or thereafter to be born of slaves within the province\r\nwere to be slaves for the term of their natural lives.[730] Nothing is\r\nsaid in the act of children one of whose parents was free. The act was\r\nrepealed in 1715.[731] New York, on its own part, in 1706, decreed that\r\nany negro, Indian, mulatto or mustee child should follow the condition\r\nof the mother and be esteemed a slave “to all intents and purposes\r\nwhatsoever.”[732] Frequent incidental mention, also, is found in the\r\ndocuments of the time and in newspaper advertisements to slaves “born\r\nin the house”.[733]\r\n\r\nCertain judicial decisions rendered in the trial of cases in federal\r\nand state courts, finally, offer clear indication as to the legality of\r\nholding in slavery the children of Indian slave mothers.[734] Of these\r\ndecisions the one rendered by the Virginia court of appeals in 1831 is\r\nparticularly instructive. In part it runs as follows: “I cannot for a\r\nmoment doubt the propriety of the former decisions of this court, and\r\nof the instructions under consideration, that proof that a party is\r\ndescended in the female line from an Indian woman, and especially a\r\nnative American, without anything more is _prima facie_ proof of his\r\nright to freedom liable to be repelled by proof that his race has been\r\nimmemorially held in slavery; which may be in turn rebutted by the\r\nconsideration of the ignorance and helpless condition of persons in\r\nthat situation, aided by other circumstances, such as that many such\r\nwere bound by law to a service equivalent, in all respects, to a state\r\nof temporary slavery, until they attained the age of thirty-one years;\r\nand in many cases (according to circumstances existing in almost every\r\ncase) for an uncertain term beyond that age.”[735]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                          +Property Relations+\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the practices connected with the institution of negro and Indian\r\nslavery in the Spanish colonies were known to the English colonists,\r\nyet at first the latter did not see fit to impose the status of slavery\r\nupon the Indians brought into the colonies by way of trade with the\r\nSpanish islands or otherwise, but were content to retain possession\r\nof the services of their subject Indians without taking possession\r\nof their persons through legal declarations imposing the status of\r\nslavery upon them.[736] Such Indians were held in the status of\r\nservitude, a condition which stood “midway between freedom and absolute\r\nsubjection”, and which was the “historic base upon which slavery,\r\nby the extension and addition of incidents, was constructed.”[737]\r\nThe right of ownership of the services of both negroes and Indians\r\nwas, after all, what the colonists most desired, and appeared to\r\npromise satisfaction in this instance as it had in the case of the\r\nwhite indentured servants. Indian servitude not only preceded Indian\r\nslavery, but even continued after the institution of slavery was fully\r\ndeveloped. This is true of most, if not all, of the English-American\r\ncolonies. It is certainly true of Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.\r\nStatutory recognition of slavery in general by the English-American\r\ncolonies occurred as follows: by Massachusetts in 1641; by Connecticut\r\nin 1650; by Virginia in 1661; by Maryland in 1663; by New York and New\r\nJersey in 1664; by South Carolina in 1682; by Pennsylvania and Rhode\r\nIsland in 1700; by North Carolina in 1715; and by Georgia in 1755.[738]\r\nBut the legislation of these dates did not always include the subject\r\nIndians. When such was the case, however, according to a strict legal\r\ninterpretation, any subject Indian, if enslaved, had the right to\r\ndemand his freedom from the colonial courts. Such an instance existed\r\nin the case of Virginia where the acts of 1655 and 1661 specifically\r\nforbade Indian slavery and guaranteed to the subject Indians all the\r\nrights of servants.[739]\r\n\r\nThe recognition of Indian as well as negro slavery by customary law\r\ncame somewhat earlier than by statute law. With the extension of\r\nthe period of servitude to a life term, the change from servitude\r\nto slavery was practically completed so far as customary law was\r\nconcerned. Only the enactment of legal provisions sanctioning the\r\nchange was necessary to complete the process. The common use in\r\nsubsequent law of the terms “servant for life”, “perpetual servant”,\r\nand “bond servant” as synonymous with the term “slave” shows how\r\nlittle change was really effected in the condition of the servant.\r\nSuch change consisted chiefly, from the standpoint of the master,\r\nin the extension of his right to service, and consequently in the\r\nextension of his obligation of protection and maintenance, and what was\r\nstill more important, in the acquisition of the right of possession\r\nof the offspring of his slaves. From the standpoint of the slave,\r\nit meant little more than the loss of the right to ultimate liberty,\r\npolitical and civil, and the extension of his right to protection and\r\nmaintenance.[740]\r\n\r\nThe legislation which marked the changing status varied in nature in\r\nthe several colonies. In certain colonies the slavery status was simply\r\nrecognized as being in existence by certain acts relating to slaves,\r\nwithout any formal declaration to the effect that Indians held in\r\nservitude should be considered slaves. In other colonies the condition\r\nof slavery as applied to Indians was legalized by general acts relating\r\nto slavery in general, and not specifying either Indians or negroes.\r\nIn still other colonies the holding of Indians in a condition of\r\nactual slavery was legalized by legislative acts relating directly to\r\nIndians. An act of this latter character was passed by New York in 1678\r\ndeclaring that all Indians that should come to, or be brought into\r\nthe province at any time during the succeeding six months, should be\r\nsold as slaves for the benefit of the government.[741] South Carolina,\r\nin an act of 1712 relating to the “better ordering and governing of\r\nnegroes and slaves”, provided that “all negroes, mulattoes, mestizoes\r\nor Indians which have at any time heretofore been sold, or now are held\r\nand taken to be, or hereafter shall be brought and sold as slaves, are\r\nhereby declared slaves to all intents and purposes; excepting all such\r\nnegroes, mulattoes, mestizoes or Indians which heretofore have been,\r\nor hereafter shall be for some particular merit, made and declared\r\nfree, either by the Governor and Council of this province, or by their\r\nrespective owners and masters; and also, excepting all such negroes,\r\nmulattoes, mestizoes or Indians as can prove they ought not to be sold\r\nas slaves”.[742] The acts, already mentioned in other connections,\r\nauthorizing the enslavement of Indian captives taken in war, the\r\nholding in slavery of such captives when obtained in trade from sources\r\noutside the colony, and the enslavement of free Indians by the colonial\r\nauthorities as punishment for misdemeanors and crimes, are also cases\r\nin point.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of English law the action of the colonial\r\nlegislatures enacting the slavery status had no legal sanction. It\r\nwas based on the interpretation of the common law of nations, that\r\nis, it was carried on in accordance with a “law not promulgated\r\nby legislation, and rested upon prevalent views of universal\r\njurisprudence, or the law of nations supported by the express or\r\nimplied authority of the home government” concerning the institution\r\nof slavery.[743] So the colonies, by a gradual process of changing\r\nconditions and legal enactments, substituted the slavery status for\r\nthe servitude status without molestation from the home government,\r\nwhich was interested in colonial slave conditions and legislation\r\nonly when the African slave trade was involved. So long, therefore,\r\nas the enactment of colonial laws decreeing the slavery status did\r\nnot interfere with that trade, the home government gave no attention\r\nto the matter. As for Indian slavery _per se_, if England had given\r\nit any attention whatever, she would probably have considered it a\r\npurely colonial matter. Since it was never sufficiently extensive to\r\ninterfere with negro slavery and the slave trade, it never received any\r\nattention from the home government, and so existed as legal because\r\nnever declared illegal. An authority on the legal status of early\r\nAmerican slavery states: “It may be laid down as a legal axiom, that in\r\nall governments in which the municipal regulations are not absolutely\r\nopposed to slavery, persons already reduced to that state may be held\r\nin it, and we also assume, as a first principle, that slavery has been\r\npermitted and tolerated in all the colonies established in America by\r\nEuropean powers, as relates to blacks and also as relates to Indians\r\nin the first periods of conquest and colonization. This accounts in\r\na measure for the absence of any legislative act of European powers\r\nfor intruding slavery into the American dominions.”[744] Hence it\r\nfollowed that the English colonial charters authorizing the colonial\r\nlegislatures to make laws, gave no license as such to enslave.[745]\r\n\r\nWith the change from the status of servitude to the status of slavery,\r\ncertain of the attributes of the former condition were continued and\r\nconnected with the latter. Chief of these, and the fundamental idea on\r\nwhich the change was effected, was the conception of property right\r\nwhich, from the idea of the ownership of an individual’s service\r\nresting upon contract implied or expressed, came to be that of the\r\nownership of an individual’s person.\r\n\r\nIndian slaves were recognized as property in all the English colonies,\r\nand were openly bought and sold at both public and private sales\r\nlike negroes and other property.[746] They were advertised in the\r\ncolonial newspapers with statements of their qualifications and\r\nability for work, their ages, and sometimes descriptions of their\r\npersonal appearance. From the New England newspapers it is apparent\r\nthat for a time dealers advertised such slaves for sale openly in\r\ntheir own names.[747] Later the possible purchaser was directed by\r\nthe advertisement to “inquire of the Printer and know further”, or\r\nto “inquire at the Post Office”.[748] It was not uncommon for slaves\r\noffered for sale to choose their future owner from those who desired to\r\npurchase them,[749] or to approve the bill of sale.[750]\r\n\r\nLike other property, real or personal, Indian slaves could be given\r\naway by word of mouth or by “last will and testament”. One of the\r\nearliest of such wills on record is that of Governor John Winthrop\r\nof Massachusetts, made in 1639, by which he gave to his son Adam,\r\nGovernor’s Island and with it “also my Indians thereon”.[751] In South\r\nCarolina where Indian slaves were most numerous, the records of their\r\ndisposal by will are frequent.[752] The custom, in fact, was universal\r\nin the colonies.[753]\r\n\r\nIndian slaves were listed in the various colonies in the inventories\r\nof estates along with indentured servants of unexpired terms[754] and\r\nnegro slaves.[755] They were taken like other chattels in payment\r\nfor debt, and in certain of the colonies provision was made by law\r\nregarding the matter. South Carolina, February 7, 1690, decreed that a\r\nslave was to be taken like any other chattel as payment for debt.[756]\r\nMaryland, 1729, passed an act to the effect that no slave should be\r\ntaken for any debt due from the deceased so long as there should be\r\nany other goods sufficient for the purpose.[757] In those colonies\r\nwhere legislation makes no mention of the matter, it is known from\r\nthe history of negro slavery that the custom was similar to that of\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nThe proximity of the Indian tribes to the colonists, furthermore,\r\nafforded a condition most suitable for the escape of Indian slaves.\r\nIndividual testimony, frequent advertisements in the colonial\r\nnewspapers giving descriptions of fugitive Indian slaves and offering\r\nrewards for their capture and return, and the amount of colonial\r\nlegislation concerning both negro and Indian runaway slaves, show that\r\nIndians held in servitude took frequent advantage of the opportunities\r\nat hand for their escape, and that their owners used all possible\r\nmeans to regain their lost property. At the time following the Pequot\r\nWar, Mason complained of the tendency to run away shown by the Pequot\r\nslaves in the colonies.[758] The Indians enslaved after King Philip’s\r\nWar likewise escaped. Mayhew tells of runaway Indian slaves in\r\nMassachusetts in 1690.[759] In this same year one Isaac Morrill of New\r\nJersey was arrested at Newbury, Massachusetts, for enticing Indian and\r\nnegro slaves to run away.[760]\r\n\r\nThe _Boston News Letter_ came into existence, 1704,[761] at about the\r\ntime when Indian slaves began to be brought into the northern colonies\r\nfrom the Spanish islands and from the Carolinas. Rarely was there an\r\nissue of that or the other Massachusetts newspapers from that time down\r\nto the Revolutionary period which did not contain an advertisement\r\nfor a runaway Indian slave. Sometimes the same advertisement was\r\nrepeated in two or three successive issues,[762] and was often\r\ninserted in more than one newspaper. For the capture and return of the\r\nfugitives, rewards were offered, sometimes indefinite in nature as\r\n“suitable rewards”,[763] sometimes of stated amounts as £3.[764] forty\r\nshillings,[765] twenty shillings,[766] £6,[767] £20,[768] £5,[769]\r\n£7,[770] £15,[771] four pistoles,[772] fifty shillings.[773] These\r\nadvertisements relate for the most part to fugitive men and boy Indian\r\nslaves, but advertisements relating to runaway women Indian slaves are\r\nnot lacking.[774] The escapes appear for the most part, though not\r\nalways, to have been made singly. One advertisement shows two Indian\r\nmen, two Indian women and an Indian boy belonging to different persons\r\nto have escaped together.[775] Captains of vessels were often cautioned\r\nin the advertisements against carrying away such fugitive slaves, and\r\nany person harboring them or aiding them to escape was threatened with\r\nfull penalty of the law.\r\n\r\nAll the colonies enacted fugitive slave laws. Some of these laws were\r\napplied to slaves in general, some to negroes and “other slaves,”\r\nstill others to negro, mulatto and Indian slaves. The colonies where\r\nslavery was of greatest extent had the most extensive and elaborate\r\nlaws on the subject, and those colonies where Indian slavery existed\r\nto any considerable extent included the term “Indian slaves” in their\r\nlaws. Pennsylvania made but little provision regarding runaway slaves.\r\nMaryland concerned itself more largely with servants.\r\n\r\nSome of these laws did not define the term “runaway slave”. Others in\r\nan attempt to avoid confusion gave clear explanations of the term. Such\r\nan act was passed by Connecticut in 1690, specifying that any Indian,\r\nmulatto or negro servants and slaves wandering outside the place to\r\nwhich they belonged without a ticket of leave or pass in writing from\r\nsome assistant or justice of the peace or from their owner, were to\r\nbe considered runaways and treated as such.[776] New Jersey, in 1713,\r\nconsidered as runaways any negro, mulatto or Indian slave who was five\r\nmiles from his master’s habitation without written leave of absence\r\nfrom his owner, and any such slave found in New Jersey but belonging to\r\nanother province was declared a runaway.[777] South Carolina, by the\r\nact of 1690, considered as a runaway any negro or Indian slave absent\r\nfrom his master’s plantation (no distance specified), without a written\r\nticket of leave unless in company with a white man.[778]\r\n\r\nTo discourage aid and assistance being given fugitive slaves, the\r\ncolonies specified by legislative acts the punishment to follow such\r\noffense. On June 14, 1705, Lord Cornbury, in his opening speech to the\r\nNew York assembly, expressed his opinion regarding the necessity for\r\npassing an act to prevent negro, Indian and mulatto slaves running away\r\nfrom their masters.[779] An act of the common council of Albany, 1686,\r\nforbade all persons harboring negro or Indian slaves in their houses\r\nwithout the owners’ consent.[780] Pennsylvania, 1726, decreed a fine\r\nof five shillings for the first hour and one shilling for every hour\r\nafterward that any person should harbor or entertain any runaway negro,\r\nIndian or mulatto slave.[781] Virginia, by the act of 1705, specified\r\na fine of £100 for any shipmaster transporting any negro, mulatto or\r\nIndian slave out of the colony without permission of the owner.[782]\r\nSouth Carolina, also, by an act of 1690, levied forty shillings fine\r\non any one not attempting to apprehend a negro or Indian slave coming\r\ninto his plantation without a ticket of leave from his master or not\r\naccompanied by a white man.[783]\r\n\r\nNot infrequently the colonial authorities were called upon to furnish\r\nprotection to the owners of Indian slaves against their seizure by\r\nthe free Indians, or against fugitive Indian slaves being hidden and\r\nretained by the tribes. To effect the return of such slaves special\r\ninducements were offered by the colonial government from time to time.\r\nAt the close of the Pequot War an agreement was made by the chief,\r\nMiantonomo, and the Massachusetts government, by which the former\r\npromised to seize such Pequot slaves as escaped, and return them to\r\ntheir owners.[784] On June 2, 1641, the general court of Massachusetts\r\nmade a similar agreement with Lieutenant Willard of Concord, Ensign\r\nHolman of Dorchester, and Sergeant Collacot of Dorchester. As a partial\r\nreturn for the monopoly of the Indian trade granted them, these men\r\nagreed to demand, wherever they should find them, all fugitive Pequot\r\nslaves that belonged to the English.[785] A similar request for\r\nprotection is found in New York, where two widows petitioned governor\r\nand council, May 16, 1717, regarding two Indian slaves who were\r\nsecreted by the Indians of Pekkemeck.[786] Events in North Carolina,\r\nfollowing the Tuscarora War, offer numerous illustrations of colonial\r\naction taken to secure the return of such fugitives. The Indian slaves\r\nin the colony, consisting largely of the captive Tuscarora, frequently\r\nescaped and took refuge with the free Indians of their tribe. The\r\nIndians neglected to return these runaways, and the council was\r\ncompelled to call many times upon “King Blount” to compel his people\r\nto return the slaves according to his agreement with the Carolina\r\ngovernment. Such action is recorded as late as 1731.[787]\r\n\r\nSometimes this protection of slave owners in their property rights\r\nassumed intercolonial importance. Such a recognition of property rights\r\noccurred in the articles of federation of the United Colonies of New\r\nEngland, 1643, provision: “If any servant run away from his master\r\ninto any of these confederated jurisdictions, ... in such case, upon\r\ncertificate of one magistrate in the jurisdiction of which the said\r\nservant fled, or upon other due proof, the said servant shall be\r\ndelivered, either to his master or any other that pursues and brings\r\nsuch certificate or proof”.[788]\r\n\r\nSince it was found that certain Indian villages harbored fugitive\r\nIndians, the Confederation, September 5, 1646, decided that such\r\nvillages might be raided and the inhabitants carried off, women and\r\nchildren being spared as far as possible, and declared that “because\r\nit will be chargeable keeping Indians in prison and, if they should\r\nescape, they are liable to prove more insolent and dangerous after,\r\nit was thought fit that upon such seizure ... the magistrates of the\r\njurisdiction deliver up the Indian seized to the party or parties\r\nindamaged, either to serve or to be shipped out and exchanged for\r\nnegroes, as the cause will justly bear.”[789] In the same year the\r\ncommissioners of the United Colonies sent a letter to Governor Kieft\r\nof New Netherland demanding the return of an Indian captive “fled from\r\nher master at Hartford” and “entertained in your house at Hartford\r\nand, though required by the magistrate, ... under the hands of your\r\nagent there denied ... and said to have been either married or abused\r\nby one of your men”. “Such a servant,” they declared, “is part of her\r\nmaster’s estate and a more considerable part than a beast.” Kieft\r\nrefused to give up the Indian woman, and replied: “as concerns the\r\nbarbarian handmaid”, it is “apprehended by some, that she is no slave,\r\nbut a freewoman, because she was neither taken in war, nor bought\r\nwith price, but was in former times placed with me by her parents for\r\neducation”.[790] By the intercolonial treaty of September 19, 1650, the\r\nprovision of the articles of confederation concerning fugitive slaves\r\nwas extended so as to include the intercourse of the New Englanders and\r\nthe Dutch.[791] Another fugitive slave law similar to that of 1643 was\r\ncontained in the articles of confederation of the United Colonies in\r\n1672.[792]\r\n\r\nSimilar events involved New York and Pennsylvania. In 1723, some Seneca\r\nIndians trading in South Carolina carried away an Indian slave boy\r\nbelonging to an Englishman there. The governor of New York charged\r\nthe Seneca with the act and demanded that the slave boy be returned.\r\nThe Seneca acknowledged that they were among the party who took the\r\nslave boy, said that he had been given to some Susquehanna Indians,\r\nand requested the governor to ask for him there.[793] An undated\r\nletter of William Penn to the Susquehanna Indians regarding some\r\nIndian slaves taken from the people of New York by them, refers to a\r\nsimilar incident. In it Penn mentions the people of New York having\r\ntwice appealed to him regarding an Indian woman and boy, both slaves,\r\nbought in New York from the governor of Carolina, which the Susquehanna\r\nIndians had taken away. Penn urged the Susquehanna to deliver the\r\nslaves to his messenger that they might be put on board a vessel and\r\nreturned to New York.[794]\r\n\r\nIn July, 1682, Plymouth provided that if any Indian who was a servant\r\nof the English should run away, “such Indians where such a runaway\r\nIndian is come, shall forthwith give notice of the runaway to the\r\nIndian constable, who shall immediately apprehend such Indian servant\r\nand carry him or her before the overseer or next magistrate.”[795]\r\n\r\nAt a meeting, January 9, 1713, the council of North Carolina considered\r\nthe matter of two Indian slaves sent to the colony from Virginia,\r\nand found that they belonged to two residents of South Carolina from\r\nwhom, presumably, they had been stolen. The council, acknowledging the\r\nowners’ claim to the right of possession, ordered that the Indians be\r\ndelivered to Colonel James Moore “for the use and on behalf of the\r\nowners.”[796]\r\n\r\nA case in Massachusetts shows a colonial government remunerating a\r\ncitizen for an Indian slave taken from him by governmental authority.\r\nDuring King Philip’s War, one George Speere bought an Indian from\r\nCaptain Hull who had been empowered by the council to make sale of\r\nIndian captives at that time. The council, by warrant of the constable\r\nof Braintree, took away the Indian boy for some reason. Speere\r\ncomplained of the loss of his property, after, as he said, he had\r\nbrought it to a “very tractable and profitable state”, and petitioned\r\nto have his Indian boy returned to him, or to be given his value. The\r\ncouncil accordingly granted him the value.[797]\r\n\r\nAs in the case of other property, the colonial courts were sometimes\r\ncalled upon to settle disputes regarding the ownership of Indian\r\nslaves. Two events in Massachusetts and North Carolina are cases in\r\npoint. In 1684, the Massachusetts Court of Assistants was called\r\nupon to settle a case of disputed ownership which had been appealed\r\nfrom the County Court of Salem.[798] On November 24, 1777, complaint\r\nwas made to the North Carolina House of Commons by a slave owner who\r\nhad been dispossessed of his Indian slave by two other Carolinians.\r\nThe House appointed a committee to investigate the matter.[799]\r\nSimilar instances in other years are recorded in connection with North\r\nCarolina.[800]\r\n\r\nWith the growth of the idea of property incident to the slavery\r\nstatus, the “early transition of the slave from personal estate to a\r\nchattel real, or real estate with accompanying incidents, was easy\r\nand natural.”[801] Under the caption of “property” both negro and\r\nIndian slaves were subject to taxation like other property, either for\r\ncolonial revenue in general or to meet local expenses. Moreover in\r\ncertain colonies both Indian and negro slaves were assigned the double\r\ncharacter of persons subject to a poll tax and property subject to a\r\nproperty tax.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina, in the act of 1690, provided “that all slaves ... as to\r\nthe payment of debts shall be deemed and taken as all other goods and\r\nchattels, ... and all negroes and slaves shall be accounted as freehold\r\nin all other cases whatsoever and descend accordingly”.[802] Middleton,\r\npresident of the council, consequently declared, in 1725, that negroes\r\nwere real property, such as houses and lands, in Carolina.[803] Yet\r\nthey were always returned as personal property in the inventories of\r\nintestates.[804] This condition continued until 1740, when it was\r\ndeclared that negroes and Indian slaves should be reputed and adjudged\r\nin law to be chattels personal in the hands of their owners and\r\npossessors and their executors, administrators and assigns.[805]\r\n\r\nVarious tax acts were passed from time to time for special reasons, and\r\nin some of these Indian slaves, along with negroes, were a part of the\r\nbasis of taxation, being rated as property without specification as to\r\nreal or personal, along with goods, lands, cattle and white servants.\r\nSuch an act was passed in 1703.[806] The act contained the general term\r\n“slaves”, which, of course, included Indian slaves by implication.\r\n\r\nA tax on polls was generally selected by the colonies as the chief\r\nsource of revenue. In accordance with this idea of taxation North\r\nCarolina during the eighteenth century regarded Indian slaves as\r\ntaxables. In the earliest legislative action of the colony taxables\r\nwere declared to be every white male aged sixteen years, and every\r\nslave, negro, mulatto, or Indian, male or female, aged twelve\r\nyears.[807] By the act of 1750, furthermore, a taxable was every white\r\nman of sixteen years of age, every negro, mulatto or mustee, and every\r\nother person of mixed blood to the fourth generation, twelve years of\r\nage.[808]\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, especially, there was much confusion regarding the\r\nposition of the slave as a person and as property. Until after the\r\nRevolution, taxes were chiefly imposed according to the number of\r\ntithables in each county, i. e., persons assessed for a poll tax.[809]\r\nThe act of 1649 declared all imported male servants to be tithables.\r\nIndians imported into the colony as servants were included by\r\nimplication. Since in the preceding year an act had declared that a\r\nspecified poll tax should be levied only on the tithables, Indian\r\nservants, as they must be called before 1670,[810] were attributed a\r\nlegal personality or a membership in the social status inconsistent\r\nwith the condition of a chattel or property. By the act of March, 1658,\r\nIndian servants, male and female, sixteen years of age, were included\r\namong the tithables by specific mention.[811] The same provision was\r\nrepeated in the acts of March, 1662.[812] Some doubt having arisen as\r\nto whether this law applied to female Indian servants as well as to\r\nmale, acts were passed in December, 1662,[813] September, 1672[814] and\r\nNovember, 1682,[815] to settle the matter. The former act related to\r\nwomen servants commonly employed in “working in the crop”; the latter\r\ndeclared that “all Indian women are and shall be tithables, and ought\r\nto pay levies in like manner as negro women brought into this country\r\ndo, and ought to pay.”\r\n\r\nIn 1682, the gradual process of change from the status of Indian\r\nservitude to that of Indian slavery was completed. The Virginia act of\r\n1670 had decreed a condition of slavery for all Indians imported into\r\nthe colony by sea.[816] But the great body of subject Indians were\r\nnatives of the country. Such Indians remained servants up to 1676, when\r\nat the beginning of the Indian war, one of Bacon’s laws made all Indian\r\ncaptives slaves.[817] In 1682, slavery was extended to captives sold\r\nby tributary Indians “in the hope of mitigating their condition as it\r\nwas certain that they would be held in slavery by their captors.”[818]\r\nThese acts did not make provision for changing the condition of Indian\r\nservants that existed in the colony before 1670. Such a change had come\r\nabout through a gradual and natural process with the passage of the\r\nlaws mentioned and the changed attitude toward the subject Indians, so\r\nthat in fact all subject Indians were not considered slaves. Hence,\r\nin 1682, all Indian slaves were considered in law as persons inasmuch\r\nas they were tithables. By 1705 it was found necessary, for legal\r\npurposes, to “advance the property notion of the slave from personalty\r\nto realty,”[819] though certain incidents of personalty were still\r\nretained. The statute of that year by which the change was effected\r\nprovided that in future “all negro, mulatto or Indian slaves in all\r\ncourts of jurisdiction and other places within this dominion shall be\r\nheld, taken and adjudged to be real estate and not chattels”.[820] As\r\na part of real estate property slaves were subject to taxation. An act\r\nof 1748 again made slaves personal estate, but was repealed by the\r\nking, October 31, 1751.[821] By the acts of 1779 and 1781 slaves were\r\nstill liable to a poll tax of £5 and 10s. respectively, to be paid\r\nby the owner.[822] So it may be seen that from 1649 until after the\r\nRevolution Indian servants and slaves either as persons or as property\r\nwere used as a basis for taxation in Virginia.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts was the only other colony that assigned the double\r\nstatus of personalty and real property to its slaves. There, as in\r\nVirginia, the status varied from time to time. Under the earliest laws\r\nof taxation in that colony, slaves must have been rated, if taxed\r\nat all, as polls, the owners paying for them as for other servants\r\nand children, “such as take not wages”. This continued until 1692,\r\nwhen “every male slave of sixteen years old and upwards” was rated\r\nat “£20 estate”.[823] But in 1694 “all negroes, mulattoes and Indian\r\nservants, as well male as female, of sixteen years old and upwards”,\r\nwere assigned a status of personalty by being rated at 12d. per poll,\r\nthe same as other polls.[824] In 1695, “all negro, mulatto and Indian\r\nservants” again became a property basis for taxation by an act valuing\r\nnegro, mulatto and Indian male servants fourteen years of age and\r\nupward at £20 estate, and similar female servants at £14 estate, unless\r\ndisabled by infirmity.[825] They were subsequently, in 1696,[826] rated\r\nas “other personal estate”, which rating was continued in 1697[827]\r\nand 1698,[828] in the latter year “according to the found judgment and\r\ndiscretion of the assessors, not excluding faculties”, i. e., trades or\r\nprofessions. This rating for faculties was common throughout the early\r\ntax laws of Massachusetts, and continued into the nineteenth century.\r\nIt was applied to white men from the beginning,[829] but the law of\r\n1698 appears to have been the first and only one in which the feature\r\nwas applied to the negroes, mulattoes and Indians who were slaves.\r\nThere was little variation in the tax laws during the remainder of\r\nthe colonial period. All Indian, negro and mulatto servants continued\r\nto be rated as personal property in the usual yearly levies.[830]\r\nOccasionally, as in the earlier period, some of those who were servants\r\nfor a term of years, but not for life, were numbered and rated as\r\npolls.[831] Other exemptions were made in the case of slaves “disabled\r\nby infirmity”.[832]\r\n\r\nIn 1716, an attempt was made to modify this feature of property status\r\nfor slaves in Massachusetts. In that year Judge Sewall was a member of\r\nthe council, and on June 22, 1716, proposed to that body that negro\r\nand Indian slaves be no longer rated with horses and hogs as personal\r\nproperty. The council agreed to the proposition, and its decision\r\nwas sent down to the deputies for concurrence. But the members of\r\nthe house refused assent on the ground that they were just going to\r\nmake a new valuation. In the preceding valuations of the property of\r\ntheir constituents, Indian, negro and mulatto slaves were regarded as\r\nproperty, and the owners of it should be taxed accordingly.[833]\r\n\r\nIn the remaining colonies that taxed Indian and other slaves, such\r\ntaxation was levied on the basis of property, sometimes personal and\r\nsometimes real. The annual tax in South Carolina included slaves among\r\nthe taxable property.[834] A law of 1719 provided that since Indian\r\nslaves were commonly reputed to be of less value than negro slaves, all\r\npersons possessing them should pay for each Indian in proportion to\r\nhalf the value of whatever might be rated and imposed for each negro,\r\nand no more.[835]\r\n\r\nIn New York Indian and negro slaves entered but little into the system\r\nof taxation, since slaves were not numerous in the colony and therefore\r\nwould furnish but a poor basis for taxation, and the finances of the\r\ncolony were provided for more largely by income taxes than otherwise.\r\nIn 1709, however, along with a tax on chimneys, fireplaces and stoves,\r\na tax of two shillings was levied on every negro or Indian slave from\r\nfifteen to sixty years of age, with directions for collecting the same,\r\nand provision for fine and punishment if such tax were not paid.[836]\r\nAgain, in 1734, when arrangement was made to raise a certain amount\r\nyearly for a period of ten years, one source of revenue was to be a\r\ntax of “two pennyweight and twelve grains of Sivil Pillar or Mexican\r\nPlate, or the sum of one shilling in Bills of Credit made current in\r\nthis colony” on every Indian or mulatto slave who was above the age of\r\nfourteen and under the age of fifty years.[837]\r\n\r\nAn instance of Indian slaves serving as a basis of taxation in a local\r\nlevy is found in the history of Rye, New York. At a town meeting in\r\n1703, to raise the assessment for the ensuing year, it was decided that\r\na portion of the sum should be obtained by the tax on £12 valuation of\r\nall slaves of sixteen years old and upward.[838] Though Indian slaves\r\nwere not mentioned in the town action, they were doubtless included by\r\nimplication, for in 1711 the people of the town were called upon to pay\r\ntaxes under “an act for raising one shilling on every Indian and negro\r\nslave.”[839]\r\n\r\nIn most of the colonies import duties, and in at least one instance\r\nexport duties, were levied on Indian slaves brought into or taken from\r\nthe colonies. Such duties were generally levied for self-defense,\r\nthough occasionally for revenue. During the colonial period England’s\r\ninterest in the African slave trade led her to take effective\r\nmeasures to dispose of as many negroes as possible in the American\r\ncolonies. In course of time the colonists awoke to the danger which\r\nmight result from an excess of an ignorant servile class which in\r\nsome sections outnumbered the white population. Frequent attempts\r\nwere made in various colonies to check the importation of negroes\r\nby levying import duties. At times Indians as well as negroes were\r\nincluded in these laws. In their enactment it seems probable that the\r\ncolonial legislatures had a double purpose: to shut out undesirables\r\nof both races, and to prevent the importation of negroes in the guise\r\nof Indians. Real danger threatened the colonies from an excessive\r\nimportation of Indians as slaves, and an attempt was therefore made to\r\ncheck it. In those colonies where import duties furnished a substantial\r\npart of the colonial revenue, such duties were levied on Indian slaves\r\nas well as on other property.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1698 the importation of negroes into South Carolina\r\nhad reached such proportions that the safety of the province was\r\nconsidered endangered.[840] Attempts to check such importation were\r\naccordingly made throughout the colonial period by levying import\r\nduties. As the number of Indian slaves in the colony increased, they\r\ntoo were included as a basis for duties. By the act of 1721, the\r\nimportation of negro, mulatto, mustee and Indian slaves (Spanish\r\nIndians excepted) by their owners was permitted without duty, provided\r\nsuch owner intended to settle in the colony and employ the slaves in\r\nhis own service. He was required, however, to take an oath that in case\r\nhe sold any of these slaves within twelve months after bringing them\r\ninto the colony, he would pay certain required duties.[841]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Indians were considered especially undesirable.\r\nAccordingly, an act of 1722 imposed upon all such Spanish Indians,\r\nnegroes, mulattoes and mustees imported, a duty of £50 current money of\r\nthe province.[842] The duty on Indian slaves was levied without regard\r\nto age, while that on negro slaves was graduated according to age. A\r\nreport to the Board of Trade, February 2, 1736, gave the duty on negro\r\nslaves imported from Africa above ten years old as £10; under ten years\r\nold, £5; and on all Indians imported, £50 each.[843] The following\r\nwas the tariff schedule on negroes and Indians in force in 1775.[844]\r\n“Indians imported as slaves, each £50. Negroes or slaves, four feet two\r\ninches or more in height, each £10. Negroes, under four feet two, and\r\nabove three feet two inches, each £5. Negroes, under four feet two, and\r\nabove three feet two inches, sucking children excepted, each 2£ 10s.\r\nNegroes or slaves from any of his Majesty’s plantations in America,\r\nwhere such slaves have been for six months or more, unless imported by\r\nthe owners with design to be employed on their own account, besides the\r\nabove £10, £5, and £2 10s., each slave, £50.”\r\n\r\nThe earliest act passed in Virginia to check the importation of\r\nnegroes, that of 1699, imposed a duty of fifteen shillings per poll\r\nupon every servant not born in England or Wales, and twenty shillings\r\nfor every negro or other slave imported into the colony. This duty was\r\ncontinued or increased by a number of temporary acts between 1669 and\r\n1776.[845] The acts were worded “all slaves” or “negroes and other\r\nslaves”. Thus import duties were levied upon Indian as well as negro\r\nslaves. A statute of 1710 advanced the duty on negroes to £5 per head,\r\nand placed a duty of twenty shillings on Indians imported by land.[846]\r\nThe difference in the amount of the duties is indicative of the\r\nrelative amount of danger attached by the colonists to the presence of\r\nthe two classes of slaves in the colony.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Tuscarora War, the northern colonies realized fully\r\nthe possible results of the importation of the captives sold in their\r\ncommunities. Some of them in consequence passed laws to ward off danger\r\nfrom this source. In 1712, Rhode Island passed an act levying a duty\r\nof forty shillings on every Indian brought into the colony. The act\r\nwas enforced by severe penalties, and every ship owner was required to\r\ngive bond to the amount of £50 for observing it.[847] New Hampshire,\r\nin 1714, levied the heavy duty of £10 on the importation of any Indian\r\ninto the province.[848]\r\n\r\nPennsylvania, also, June 7, 1712, voted to levy a duty of £20 on all\r\nnegroes and Indians brought into the colony by land or water, certain\r\nnegroes from the West Indies excepted. Exception was also made in the\r\ncase of negro and Indian slaves brought in by their owners with the\r\nintention of taking them out again within the space of twenty days, and\r\nin the case of Indians or negroes belonging to persons in the province\r\nand sent out of it on their masters’ business with intent to return\r\nagain.[849]\r\n\r\nA duty of £10 was levied by New Jersey in 1713.[850] In January, 1739,\r\nthe New Jersey assembly presented to the council for concurrence\r\na bill entitled “An act for laying a duty on negro, Indian and\r\nmulatto slaves imported into this province.”[851] The bill did not\r\nappeal favorably to the council and was rejected.[852] The reason\r\nfor rejection was the need of laborers in the province, owing to the\r\ndecrease in the number of white indentured servants, and the check\r\nthat this bill would give to the importation of negroes.[853] But in\r\nNovember, 1769, a bill setting forth as its purpose the encouragement\r\nof the coming of white servants by limiting the importation of blacks,\r\nwas passed. The duty in this case was higher than that proposed in\r\n1739, being £15 on all slaves imported, negro, Indian or mulatto.\r\nPunishment for refusal or neglect to pay was specified. Purchase of\r\na slave “made upon the Water or Waters along the Seacoast” of the\r\nprovince, or on those between the province and the provinces of New\r\nYork, Pennsylvania and the Lower Counties of the Delaware, was, by\r\nsection VII of the act, declared a “purchase within the county” of New\r\nJersey “opposite to such Water”, and so was exempt from duty.[854]\r\n\r\nThe second cause for levying duties on Indians and other slaves was\r\nto obtain revenue. Virginia in its legislation on the subject had\r\npretended at least that such was its purpose, and to carry out the\r\npretense had devoted the amounts thus obtained to meeting colonial\r\nexpenses.[855] Other colonies sought directly for revenue.[856] New\r\nYork was a striking example of such colonies. Import duties formed a\r\nchief source of the colonial revenue, and slaves were enumerated among\r\nthe other commodities. The act of May 1, 1702, the first specifically\r\nto mention Indian slaves, placed a duty of fifteen shillings on every\r\nnegro or Indian slave imported into the colony directly from their\r\nplace of residence, and thirty shillings upon every negro or Indian\r\nslave not so imported.[857] The act which was to continue but two years\r\nwas found to be “of great use in this colony” and was accordingly\r\nrepeated on August 4, 1705, to continue seven years.[858] On June 24,\r\n1719, it was again repeated to remain in effect from July 1, 1720, to\r\nJuly 1, 1726.[859] Still other acts imposing similar duties were passed\r\nas follows: in 1709, levying a duty of £3 on every negro imported into\r\nthe colony not directly from Africa and £3 on every other slave or\r\nslaves not directly imported into the colony from Africa, the act to\r\ncontinue till May 1, 1711;[860] on June 21, 1714, levying “a duty of\r\nten ounces of good plate” to be paid by the master or commander of any\r\nvessel, or any other person importing slaves;[861] and on September\r\n1, 1716, levying a duty of “ten ounces of good plate” on each negro,\r\nIndian or mulatto slave imported into the colony from Africa in any\r\nvessel not wholly owned by the people of the colony, and a like duty on\r\nevery negro, Indian or mulatto slave imported into the colony from any\r\npart of the West Indies or any of the neighboring colonies, negroes or\r\nother slaves going to and fro on their owners’ business excepted.[862]\r\nOn October 16, 1718, furthermore, it was decreed that no greater\r\nduty was to be demanded on any slave brought into the colony directly\r\nfrom Africa by a ship of Great Britain, than was to be demanded from\r\nvessels wholly owned by inhabitants of the colony.[863] In June 17,\r\n1726, on every Indian, negro or mulatto slave (male or female) of four\r\nyears of age or upwards imported by land or water from all places\r\nother than Africa, a duty of £4 was laid.[864] On October 14, 1732,\r\na similar duty, regardless of the place from which the slave was\r\nimported, was laid.[865] On November 28, 1734, on every negro, Indian\r\nor mulatto slave above the age of fourteen and under the age of fifty,\r\nduring the period of ten years, the duty was fixed at “the quantity of\r\ntwo pennyweight and twelve grains of Sivil pillar or Mexican plate,\r\nor the sum of one shilling in Bills of Credit made current in this\r\ncolony.”[866] On December 16, 1737, finally, every negro, Indian or\r\nmulatto slave above the age of four years imported directly from\r\nAfrica was made dutiable at the rate of five ounces of “Sivil pillar\r\nor Mexican plate” or forty shillings in bills of credit current in\r\nthe colony; and for every such slave imported from all other places\r\nby land or water, the sum of £4 in like money was exacted.[867] All\r\nslaves belonging to the crew of any vessel, and slaves coming into the\r\ncolony from the neighboring colonies upon the service of their masters,\r\nand all slaves under fourteen years of age were to be admitted free of\r\nduty.[868] Any person coming into the colony alone, or with his or her\r\nfamily to reside or visit in the colony, was allowed to bring slaves\r\nfor personal service, provided the owner gave sufficient security to\r\nthe treasurer within four days after the importation thereof, that,\r\nwhenever such slaves should be sold, the duty imposed by the act should\r\nbe paid within two days after such sale. Upon failure to pay such duty,\r\nthe owner or disposer of such slaves was to forfeit the sum of £10, the\r\nslave or slaves, nevertheless, to be subject to the duty in question.\r\nThe duties provided for by the act were to remain in existence for the\r\nperiod of one year.[869] At the expiration of the act it was continued\r\nfor another year, with certain amendments which did not relate to\r\nslaves.[870] At the expiration of the specified period it was again\r\ncontinued for another year or until the close of 1740,[871] when it\r\nwas again continued until December, 1741.[872] Such acts were then\r\npassed by New York each year until the opening of the troubles of the\r\nRevolutionary period.[873]\r\n\r\nThe number of Indians exported as slaves from South Carolina was larger\r\nthan that from any other colony. As a means of obtaining revenue, as\r\nwell as of attempting to check the business of the Indian traders, the\r\ncolony passed an act in 1703 which placed a duty upon Indian slaves\r\nexported from the colony.[874] The traders were carefully instructed\r\nnot to attempt any such exportations without first paying at Charleston\r\nthe required duties, twenty shillings for each Indian exported[875].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                         +Methods of Employment+\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the English never made long journeys of exploration into the\r\ninterior, as the Spanish and French did in the earliest days of their\r\noccupation of America, their use of Indian slaves as hunters, fishermen\r\nand guides was relatively limited. With the forming of settlements\r\nand the growth of institutional life this use became more prominent.\r\nIn Carolina it appears that the Indian slaves were occupied chiefly\r\nin hunting and fishing for their masters, whereas the greater part of\r\nthe harder field work was left to the negroes[876]. The Indians were\r\nexpert hunters, and as the woods abounded in game, such a hunter “was\r\nof great service in a plantation, and could furnish a family with more\r\nprovisions than they could consume”.[877] In New England, also, there\r\nis occasional mention of Indian slaves used as guides.[878] It seems\r\nprobable, however, that this service was more largely confined to the\r\nsouth where Indian slaves were less expensive and more easily procured\r\nthan in the north, for such an occupation offered more opportunity for\r\nescape than any other.\r\n\r\nIn New England the Indians retained in the colonies as slaves after\r\nthe Pequot and King Philip Wars were chiefly women and children. In\r\nthe early history of Massachusetts some of the leading families in\r\nwealth and importance unable to obtain other help, employed Indians as\r\ncooks.[879] After the wars in question the Indian slaves were put to\r\nthe same use by both Massachusetts and Connecticut.[880]\r\n\r\nThe colonial newspapers of New England attribute much domestic ability\r\nto the Indian slaves advertised in their columns: “An Indian woman\r\nwho is a very good cook, and can wash, iron and sew”;[881] “A likely\r\nIndian wench about nineteen years of age fit for any business in town\r\nor country”;[882] “An Indian woman ... fit for all manner of household\r\nwork either in town or country, can sew, wash, brew, bake, spin and\r\nmilk cows”;[883] “A lusty Carolina Indian woman fit for any daily\r\nservice”.[884] The newspapers of the middle colonies furnish a similar\r\nrecord: “A young Spanish Indian woman, fit for all manner of household\r\nbusiness”;[885] “An Indian woman and her child ... she washes, irons\r\nand starches very well, and is a good cook”.[886]\r\n\r\nThe agricultural system of New England was not favorable to the use\r\nof slaves in the fields, yet there are occasional glimpses of Indian\r\nslaves employed in agricultural pursuits. In the account book of\r\nLieutenant Stephen Longfellow, 1710, appears the item: “Bouston one day\r\nto plant”. Bouston was his Indian slave.[887] It has been considered\r\nprobable, judging from the number of negro and Indian slaves in Rhode\r\nIsland, that both were an important factor in developing the stock\r\nfarming of the colony.[888] The newspaper advertisements of the day\r\noffer some information on this point: “A Carolina Indian man fit for\r\nany service within doors or without”;[889] “An Indian boy about sixteen\r\nyears old, fit for either sea or land service”;[890] “An Indian man ...\r\nfit for any service”;[891] “A Survanam Indian man, twenty-five years\r\nof age, who has been in the country thirteen years, fit for service in\r\neither country or town, and who can mow well”.[892]\r\n\r\nIn all the southern colonies Indian slaves worked in the fields side\r\nby side with the negroes up to the time of the Revolution.[893] The\r\ndiscovery, about 1693, of rice as a profitable staple for export, made\r\nnecessary a large supply of labor in South Carolina; hence along with\r\nthe negroes so largely imported to meet the demand, the Indian slaves\r\nworked also as the plantation system grew. In South Carolina, Governor\r\nMoore employed some of his Indian slaves in tilling his fields.[894]\r\n\r\nThe instances of Indian slaves employed by their owners in manual\r\noccupations are more numerous in New England than elsewhere. The\r\nnewspapers furnish instances like the following: “An Indian lad about\r\neighteen years old, a cooper by trade”[895] “... can do anything at\r\nthe carpenter’s trade”;[896] “An Indian lad ... he can work at the\r\nweaver’s trade”.[897] Similar advertisements are found in the New York\r\npapers: “An Indian man ... a good carpenter, wheelwright, cooper and\r\nbutcher”.[898]\r\n\r\nSuch instances are to be found even in the south.[899] The training of\r\nIndian slaves to skilled labor was not generally considered politic,\r\nhowever, since it interfered with the coming to the colonies of white\r\ncraftsmen who were so much desired. In 1743 or 1744, a committee in\r\nSouth Carolina, appointed to consider the most effectual means of\r\nincreasing immigration to the province, included in the bill which it\r\noriginated, a clause prohibiting the bringing up of negroes and other\r\nslaves to those mechanical trades in which white persons are usually\r\nemployed.[900]\r\n\r\nIndian slaves were made a source of income to their owners by hiring\r\nthem out to work in the same way as negroes and indentured white\r\nservants. The colonial laws in some instances made provision for\r\nsuch use. A South Carolina law of 1712 permitted an owner to hire\r\nout his slaves by the year or for a shorter time, and receive their\r\nearnings.[901] The provision was repeated in acts of 1735[902] and\r\n1740.[903] Maryland, in 1753, provided that masters of ships might hire\r\nservants or slaves from their owners.[904] New York City, in 1731, made\r\nprovision for owners hiring out negro and Indian slaves.[905] Since the\r\ncustom was common in its application to other servile classes, one may\r\nbelieve that it was followed in other colonies besides those which made\r\nlegal provision regarding it.\r\n\r\nThe use of Indian slaves in military operations was not infrequent.\r\nIn the New England wars Captain Church employed Indian captives\r\nagainst the enemy, a plan which he found serviceable on several\r\noccasions.[906] This use of Indian as well as negro slaves for military\r\npurposes was advocated in 1666 in a narrative addressed to the Duke of\r\nAlbemarle.[907]\r\n\r\nIn the intercolonial wars both negro and Indian slaves were captured\r\nby the French from the English army. In French records dealing with\r\noccurrences in Canada, under date of November 11, 1747, “four negroes\r\nand a Panis who were captured from the English during the war ...” are\r\nmentioned.[908] Still another possible proof of the use of Indian\r\nslaves by the English army is found in the Articles of Peace drawn up\r\nat Niagara, July 18, 1764. They contain the following: “Article 2nd.\r\nThat any English who may be prisoners or deserters, and any negroes,\r\nPanis, or other slaves who are British property, shall be delivered\r\nup within a month to the commandant of Detroit, and that the Hurons\r\nuse all possible endeavors to get those who are in the hands of the\r\nneighboring nations, engaging never to entertain any deserters,\r\nfugitives or slaves, but should any fly to them for protection, they\r\nare to deliver them up to the next commanding officer.”[909]\r\n\r\nThat such slaves were put to practical use in the military preparations\r\nof the colonies, is seen in the New York City ordinances of 1693 and\r\n1694 which provided that all persons, and all negro and Indian slaves\r\nthat were not listed, should work on the fortifications.[910] Such\r\na town action was not unusual. In 1638, the townsmen of Hartford,\r\nConnecticut, voted to levy on the cattle and slaves of the townspeople\r\nwhen needed for public service.[911]\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina on different occasions offered inducements for slaves to\r\nserve in the war. Some of these acts mentioned Indian slaves. In 1704,\r\nan act was passed “for raising and enlisting such slaves as shall be\r\nthought serviceable to this province in time of alarms”. It provided\r\nfor making a list of all negro, mulatto and Indian slaves in the\r\nprovince fit for service. The masters of the slaves were to be notified\r\nof such listing and given a chance to show cause why it should not be\r\ndone. In case the slaves were called upon for service, the master must\r\nfurnish weapons according to specifications. If the slave were maimed\r\nor killed in the service, the owner should be compensated out of the\r\npublic treasury.[912]\r\n\r\nTo provide still further for the use of slaves in war, it was decreed\r\nby a South Carolina act of 1719 that the captains, lieutenants, and\r\nensigns of the militia companies should form a list of negro, mulatto,\r\nmustee and Indian slaves from sixteen to sixty years of age fit for\r\nmilitary service. Owners were given a chance to show why such slaves\r\nshould not serve. These slaves when enlisted were to be armed and\r\nequipped by the captain of the division, or they might be armed by\r\ntheir owners, the latter to be compensated for loss or damage to their\r\narms. A fine of £20 was fixed for neglect of any owner to send his\r\nslave in time of alarm to the usual place of rendezvous of the various\r\ndivisions. Any officer neglecting to carry out the terms of the act was\r\nto be fined £5. A slave serving in war was to be allowed £10 reward if,\r\non the testimony of a white person, he could prove that he had killed\r\none of the enemy in time of invasion. The owner was to be indemnified\r\nfrom the public funds for a slave killed or wounded.[913]\r\n\r\nIn 1778, when Washington proposed to enlist slaves in the battalions\r\nraised by the State of Rhode Island, the assembly voted that every able\r\nbodied negro, mulatto or Indian man slave in the state might enlist in\r\neither battalion to serve during the continuance of the war. Such slave\r\nwas to receive all the bounties, wages and encouragements allowed by\r\nthe Continental Congress to any soldier enlisting in the service, and\r\nin addition was immediately to be set free.[914]\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that in this legislation regarding the use of slaves\r\nin war, no provision was made for their military training. Such\r\ntraining would require too much time, and besides being a loss to\r\nthe owners, might prove dangerous to the colony if the slaves were\r\nsufficiently numerous. Maryland recognized this fact and in 1715 voted\r\nto exclude slaves from such training.[915]\r\n\r\nJust as the Spanish and the French made diplomatic and military use\r\nof their Indian slaves by returning them to their own tribes and\r\nthus winning friendship and peace, so the English followed the same\r\npractice. In 1715, in order to secure the aid of the Tuscarora, the\r\nassembly of South Carolina voted that, for every one of these allies\r\nkilled in actual warfare by the enemy, a Tuscarora slave then in\r\nservitude among the whites should be given them for the loss, and that\r\nto every Tuscarora taking an Indian enemy captive, a slave of his\r\nnation should similarly be assigned as a reward.[916]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                               +Treatment+\r\n\r\n\r\nThe treatment of Indian slaves apparently differed in no essential\r\ndegree from that of the negroes. The slaves of the two races lived\r\nand worked together; but since the negroes were in the majority, the\r\ntreatment of slaves in general was determined by the ordinary usage\r\nwhich the whites accorded them in particular. It is customary for\r\nwriters dealing with early slavery among both the English and French\r\nof America to declare it mild in nature.[917] The statement appears to\r\nbe true. The system was patriarchal in nature, though it is doubtful\r\nif race feeling among the English was ever so nearly obliterated,\r\nand a condition of fellowship approaching equality ever so fully\r\ndeveloped, as in the case of the French. Individual cases of cruelty\r\nand harsh treatment undoubtedly existed as they must exist in all\r\ncases of servitude; but Indian slavery never became an institution\r\nsufficiently well organized to make harsh treatment general. There was\r\nnever anything in either the English or French colonies corresponding\r\nto the labor gang used by the Spanish. The number of Indian slaves\r\nin a locality was too small for that; nor did the service which the\r\ncolonists required of their Indian slaves demand it. Kind treatment,\r\nhowever, did not exclude the infliction of corporal punishment, if\r\nthought needful.[918]\r\n\r\nTo judge from the frequent newspaper advertisements of runaways, the\r\nIndian slaves of the English colonists were at least comfortably\r\ndressed. The following are typical extracts from the newspapers of the\r\nvarious colonies: “a black crape gown and a striped stuff jacket”;\r\n“a blue flannel petticoat, a dark Estamine gown and a double striped\r\ngown”;[919] “a grey coat with pewter buttons, with leather breeches,\r\nan old tow shirt, grey stockings, good shoes and felt hat”;[920] “a\r\ngreen hat and yellow breeches”;[921] “an orange colored broadcloth\r\ncoat, with a narrow cape, and a flannel jacket with narrow stripes, a\r\ncotton shirt, and a loose pair of Oxenbridge trousers ... a beaver hat,\r\nand had a bundle of clothes with him”;[922] “an old blue coat, striped\r\nflannel jacket, pretty good hat, black wig, linen trousers, white yarn\r\nstockings, and an old pair of mended shoes”;[923] “a good felt hat,\r\norange colored jacket, thick leather breeches, checked wool shirt,\r\nlight grey stockings and pretty good shoes”:[924] “pea-jacket of light\r\nbrown, leather breeches, shoes, stockings and hat”;[925] “a drugat\r\nwaistcoat and kersey petticoat of a light color”.[926] From these\r\nadvertisements it appears that the slaves were dressed much like the\r\ncolonists themselves, though doubtless their clothing often consisted\r\nof “cast offs”. In the Carolinas where slaves were more numerous,\r\ncoarse goods were imported by the planters for slaves’ clothing.\r\nMention is found of “serge suits for the servant maids, of coarse\r\nkerseys, tufted holland jackets, etc.”, with which the plantation was\r\nwont to be supplied for the slaves and convict servants. These were\r\nused in addition to cloth woven and made into clothes by the women of\r\nthe household.[927]\r\n\r\nGenerally kind as the treatment of Indian slaves may have been,\r\nthe sentiment of the English colonists was quite opposed to the\r\nintermingling of whites and Indians, bond or free, even if in the\r\nearly history of Virginia there was some effort made to encourage the\r\nmarriage of whites and free Indians.[928] It was natural, therefore,\r\nthat definite action should be taken to prevent the marriage of free\r\nwhites and Indian slaves. In 1691, Virginia passed an act forbidding\r\nthe union of free whites with Indians whether slave or free; but\r\nthere seems to have been no provision against marriage of negroes or\r\nIndians with white indentured servants.[929] The provision, perhaps,\r\nwas unnecessary, for the consent of the white indentured servant’s\r\nmaster was necessary for the validity of such a union, and such consent\r\nwas usually refused because of the strong prejudice against race\r\nmixture.[930]\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina, also, in 1715, passed an act forbidding the marriage\r\nof whites with negroes, mulattoes or Indians, under penalty of £50,\r\nand making clergymen celebrating such a marriage liable to a fine of\r\n£50.[931] A later act of 1741 provided a fine of £50 for the marriage\r\nof any white man or woman with an Indian, negro, mustee, mulatto,\r\nor any person of mixed blood to the third generation, bond or free.\r\nAny minister or justice of the peace performing such a service was\r\npunishable by a fine of £50.[932] Maryland, on its own part, in 1692,\r\npassed an act against the marriage or promiscuous sexual relations\r\nof whites and negroes or other slaves. Any white person so offending\r\nwas to become a servant for seven years, if free at the time of the\r\nmarriage. If already a servant, he or she must serve seven years after\r\nthe end of the present term of service.[933]\r\n\r\nThe same feeling existed in New England. A Massachusetts act of 1692\r\nforbade the marriage, under severe penalty, of any white person with\r\na negro, Indian or mulatto. Mixed marriages of whites and Indians,\r\nlike those admired by Sewall in 1702,[934] did occur, however, in New\r\nEngland,[935] and it appears probable that some of these marriages were\r\nwith the enslaved captives of King Philip’s War and the Indian slaves\r\nimported from Carolina.\r\n\r\nConsidering, further, the determination of legal relations between the\r\nwhites and the Indian slaves, it should be remembered that, when not\r\nspecifically referred to, Indian slaves were included by implication\r\nin the legislative acts of the various colonies relating to slaves.\r\nSufficient proof of this statement lies in the fact that Indian slaves\r\nare directly mentioned in certain of the legislative acts of any given\r\ncolony, whereas other acts of the same colony specify slaves, negroes\r\nand other slaves, or negro and mulatto slaves.[936] In one colony,\r\nVirginia, the term “mulatto” was made to include Indians by the act of\r\n1705, which provided that the child of an Indian should be “deemed,\r\naccounted, held and taken to be a mulatto.”[937]\r\n\r\nIt was a part of the universal law of slavery in the southern colonies\r\nthat a slave should not be allowed to testify against a white person in\r\nthe courts.[938] South Carolina, by the acts of 1712,[939] 1722[940]\r\nand 1735,[941] permitted “negroes and other slaves” to testify in the\r\ntrial of any slave accused of specified crimes and offenses. Certain\r\nof the colonies, by express provision, forbade Indian slaves to\r\ngive testimony in the trial of whites. North Carolina declared that\r\n“all negroes, mulattoes, bond and free to the third generation, and\r\nIndian servants and slaves, shall be deemed to be taken as persons\r\nincapable in law to be witnesses in any case whatever except against\r\neach other”.[942] Virginia, 1705, decreed that “popish recusants,\r\nconvict negroes, mulattoes and Indian servants and others not being\r\nChristians, shall be deemed and taken to be persons incapable in\r\nlaw to be witnesses in any case whatsoever”.[943] In 1732, the same\r\ncolony decreed that the evidence of any negro or Indian slave might\r\nbe received in the trial of any slave, but was not valid in the trial\r\nof any other person.[944] Maryland declared, in 1717, that it would\r\nbe dangerous to allow the evidence of any negro, mulatto or Indian\r\nslave in the trial of a freeman, but conceded that, if evidence was\r\nlacking in cases regarding any negro, mulatto or Indian slaves, that\r\nsuch slaves might give testimony for or against themselves and one\r\nanother.[945] In some of the northern colonies, at least, acts were\r\npassed forbidding slaves to give testimony in the trial of white\r\npersons. The New York law of 1706 is a case in point.[946] This feature\r\nof the law of evidence was renewed from time to time in the various\r\ncolonies and continued until the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe right to life was generally conceded all slaves regardless of\r\ncolor. At least one colony, New Hampshire, 1708, in an act guaranteeing\r\nthis right, included Indian slaves by specific mention.[947] This\r\nand other rights could be protected by appeal to the courts. If not\r\notherwise provided for, the mode of trial used by the colonists\r\nthemselves was employed in the case of Indian slaves, negroes and free\r\nIndians.[948] Special legislation concerning the trial of slaves was\r\nenacted by all the English colonies. It has been said that for an\r\nIndian to gain his point in an English court, unless his case was an\r\nextremely strong one, was a rare occurrence.[949] Whether the statement\r\nis generally true in the case of either free or slave Indians, might\r\nbe difficult to decide. Doubtless the Indian slave supported by his\r\nmaster possessed a better chance of obtaining justice than the free\r\nIndian. Since a slave was owned body and soul, and therefore had no\r\nright to life except as the same might be conceded by his owner and\r\nthe authorities, it may be said that whatever legal rights he had were\r\ngranted for the protection of the slave owners in their property rights\r\nand for the general safety of the community, rather than because of any\r\nspecial consideration of justice toward the slave himself.\r\n\r\nVirginia, in 1692, provided special courts for the trial of\r\nslaves.[950] The provisions regarding these courts were changed from\r\ntime to time. By the act of 1765 it was provided that the justices be\r\ngiven a standing commission of oyer and terminer empowering them to\r\ntry without a jury all criminal offenses committed by slaves in their\r\nrespective counties.[951] In accordance with these provisions one finds\r\nthe Earl of Dunmore issuing a commission in 1772 to certain justices in\r\nthe county of the present state of West Virginia, authorizing them to\r\nserve as a court for the trial of negro and Indian slaves.[952]\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts general court provided, 1647, that one or more of the\r\nmagistrates, according to agreement among themselves, should hold a\r\ncourt every quarter to hear and determine all cases civil and criminal,\r\nexcept those involving capital punishment, which might concern Indians,\r\nand that minor offenses should be tried by the sachems themselves.[953]\r\nAt the first general court held on Martha’s Vineyard, June 18, 1672, it\r\nwas ordered that an Indian should have liberty in any case to appeal\r\nfrom such courts as they held among themselves to the quarter court,\r\nand from the quarter court to the general court.[954]\r\n\r\nA New Jersey act of 1713 provided for the trial of any negro, Indian or\r\nmulatto slave accused of committing murder, rape, etc., by a justice\r\nand five freeholders. But if the owner of such slave should desire a\r\njury, the privilege might be allowed him. He also had the right to\r\nchallenge jurors as in other cases of like nature.[955] The act was\r\nrepealed in 1768.[956]\r\n\r\nBy a New York act of 1712, three justices and five freeholders of the\r\ncounty constituted judge and jury, seven making a quorum, for the\r\ntrial of negro and Indian slaves accused of murder, rape, insurrection\r\nor conspiracy. The prosecution provided the accusation to which the\r\noffended was obliged to plead apparently without the aid of counsel.\r\nThe owner of the slave was given the right, however, to have his slave\r\ntried by a jury of twelve, provided he paid the jury charges of nine\r\nshillings.[957] An act of 1730 changed the required number of justices\r\nto three, one to be a quorum, associated with five of the principal\r\nfreeholders of the county. Agreement of seven was required for the\r\ndecision. In this case, as before, the owner could have his slave tried\r\nby a jury of twelve if he paid the jury charges of nine shillings.[958]\r\n\r\nThere was a general tendency among slave owners to conceal crimes\r\ncommitted by slaves, or to secrete slave offenders and thus avoid the\r\nfinancial loss consequent upon the time consumed by the trial and the\r\npossible imprisonment of the slave in case of conviction, as well as\r\nthe possible injury to the slave by corporal punishment, or the still\r\ngreater loss of the slave’s entire value in case of his execution.\r\nTo prevent this interference with justice, as well as to recognize\r\nand protect the property rights of the slave owners, special acts\r\nwere passed in some of the colonies providing that the slave owner be\r\nremunerated by the colonial government in case of the loss of his slave\r\nthrough execution for crime. In some colonies the amount to be paid the\r\nowner of a slave was specified by law, and this amount varied from £30\r\nfor a man slave, and £20 for a woman slave (negro, Indian or mulatto),\r\nas provided for in a New Jersey act of 1713,[959] to £50 in a South\r\nCarolina act of 1717.[960] In other colonies the amount to be paid the\r\nslave owner was left to the decision of the court. The Maryland act of\r\n1717[961] is a case in point. It provided that the court should value\r\nthe slave (negro, mulatto or Indian) in tobacco, and that three-fourths\r\nof the value thus adjudged should be allowed in the public levy to be\r\npaid to the owner of the slave.\r\n\r\nIn all of the colonies the conduct of Indian slaves as well as that\r\nof other slaves was necessarily subject to police regulations, and\r\npunishments were decreed for their violation. These regulations did\r\nnot differ greatly in the various colonies, for the problems arising\r\nfrom the use of slaves varied but little in their nature. Among the\r\nprohibitions laid on Indian slaves specifically were the following: to\r\nbe away from home without the owner’s permission;[962] the possession\r\nof fire arms;[963] and engaging in certain kinds of traffic.[964]\r\nBoston decreed, 1728, that no Indian, negro or mulatto should carry\r\nstick or cane within the town.[965] In 1778, when forming its first\r\nproposed constitution, Massachusetts excepted from the franchise\r\n“negroes, Indians and mulattoes, bound and free”.[966] In an act of\r\n1660 the Connecticut general court declared that neither negro nor\r\nIndian servants should be required to “train, watch or ward”.[967]\r\nIn 1676, New York City excluded all Indian and negro slaves from\r\nthe privilege of being carters, and in the same year passed an act\r\nto prevent the revels of Indian and negro slaves at inns.[968] An\r\nordinance of the Albany city council, 1686, forbade any negro or Indian\r\nslave to drive a cart within the city.[969] A New York act of 1731,\r\nalso, provided for regulating the conduct of negroes and Indians in the\r\nnight time.[970]\r\n\r\nFew of the acts of colonial legislatures decreeing punishment for\r\nvarious offenses mention Indian slaves; yet in the following colonies\r\nthe death penalty was to be inflicted upon Indian slaves convicted\r\nof certain crimes:[971] by North Carolina, in 1741, for the second\r\noffense of killing horses, cattle or hogs, and for stealing, mismarking\r\nor misbranding such animals;[972] by New Jersey, in 1713, for murder,\r\nor conspiracy, or attempt to murder,[973] and in 1768, for rape, for\r\nwilfully burning any dwelling-house, barn, stable, outhouse, stacks\r\nof corn or hay, for wilfully mutilating, maiming or dismembering any\r\nperson, for manslaughter, for stealing any sum of money above the value\r\nof £5, and for committing any felony or burglary.[974]\r\n\r\nBranding as a punishments for Indian slaves was decreed by the\r\nMassachusetts general court. Runaway Pequot slaves were so\r\npunished.[975] Judging from the descriptions of runaway Indian slaves\r\ncontained in the colonial newspapers, some form of branding or marking\r\nsuch culprits was used until a late period. These brands or marks\r\nsometimes took the form of letters or symbols pricked into the skin by\r\ngunpowder or India ink. They were placed usually on the forehead or the\r\ncheeks.[976]\r\n\r\nWhipping, the most common punishment provided by law for Indian as well\r\nas other slaves, was decreed by different colonies as follows: by North\r\nCarolina, in 1741, to consist of thirty-nine lashes well laid on, for\r\ngiving false testimony in court, killing any domestic animal without\r\nthe owner’s consent, and for stealing, mismarking or misbranding such\r\nanimals;[977] by Pennsylvania, in 1721, for making, selling or using\r\nany fireworks or firearms in Philadelphia,[978] and in 1751, for taking\r\npart in horse races or shooting matches without a license, fifteen\r\nlashes for the first offense and twenty-one for the second;[979] by New\r\nJersey, in 1713, for stealing to the value of six pence;[980] by New\r\nYork City, in 1682, for absence from their owners’ homes or plantations\r\nwithout ticket of leave in owners’ handwriting,[981] in 1683, ten\r\nlashes for meeting together at any place on Sunday or any other day in\r\ngroups of more than four, and possessing arms, unless the owner paid\r\nsix shillings in lieu of the penalty,[982] in 1713[983] and 1731,[984]\r\nthirty-nine lashes for being found in the city streets, if above the\r\nage of fourteen years, later than one hour after sunset, in 1721,[985]\r\nand 1731,[986] for gambling, in 1731, for attending a funeral in\r\ngroups of more than twelve,[987] for disorderly riding through the\r\nstreets,[988] and for selling “the Fish Commonly Called and known by\r\nthe name of Bass” in the months of December, January and February,[989]\r\nand in 1759, for committing any nuisance in the streets;[990] by\r\nConnecticut, in 1750, forty lashes for publishing or speaking such\r\nwords of and concerning any other person, which, if spoken or published\r\nby a white person, would be considered by law objectionable,[991]\r\nand for being abroad after nine o’clock at night;[992] and by\r\nMassachusetts, in 1693, for dealing in stolen goods.[993] The town of\r\nMedford, Massachusetts, ordered, in 1734, that all negro, Indian or\r\nmulatto slaves found abroad without leave and not on their masters’\r\nbusiness were to be punished by whipping.[994] Block Island, finally,\r\nin 1709, provided ten lashes as punishment for any negro or Indian\r\nslave abroad after nine o’clock at night.[995]\r\n\r\nPunishment by mutilation was sometimes used, especially in the southern\r\ncolonies.[996] North Carolina, in 1741, provided that any slave,\r\nnegro or Indian, giving false testimony in any court was to have an\r\near nailed to the pillory and to stand there for an hour, after which\r\nthe ear was to be cut off. The other ear was then to be nailed in like\r\nmanner and cut off at the expiration of an hour. By the same act the\r\ncutting off of both ears was made a partial punishment for killing\r\nhorses, cattle or hogs without the consent of the owner, and for\r\nstealing, misbranding or mismarking such animals.[997]\r\n\r\nCertain of the colonies attempted to prevent the sale of spirituous\r\nliquors to Indian and other slaves. At the time of King Philip’s War,\r\nMassachusetts forbade the sale of liquor without license to any Indian\r\nor negro.[998] New Hampshire, 1686, passed a similar act.[999] In the\r\nsame year the common council of Albany prohibited the selling of liquor\r\nto Indian slaves without the owners’ permission.[1000]\r\n\r\nConsidering still another phase of treatment, namely, that which had\r\nto do with religious instruction, it may be said that, among the early\r\nregulations of the British government for the colonies, it was required\r\nthat measures be taken whereby “slaves may be best invited to the\r\nChristian faith and be made capable of being baptized therein”.[1001]\r\nIn the instructions to the colonial governors the home government not\r\ninfrequently gave directions for the conversion of both negroes and\r\nIndians, but the Indians referred to were free, not slave. The enslaved\r\nnatives were in too great a minority to attract attention; but any\r\neffort to instruct and convert the negroes must, of course, include\r\nthe former by implication.[1002]\r\n\r\nThe good intentions of the home government for the conversion of\r\nslaves were commonly frustrated by the popular belief that baptism\r\nconferred freedom upon slaves. The general attitude of slave owners\r\nin all the colonies was to oppose or forbid the religious instruction\r\nand conversion of negro and Indian slaves. They argued that the\r\ninstruction and conversion of slaves tended to make them disrespectful\r\nand unreliable and hence decreased their value. Consequently the\r\nreligious training of slaves in the earlier colonial period depended\r\nupon the personal teaching of the owner’s family.[1003] This condition\r\nof affairs appealed strongly to the missionaries of the Society for\r\nthe Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts[1004] on their coming\r\nto America primarily to work among the Indian tribes. In the reports\r\nsent to their Society early in the eighteenth century they lamented the\r\nunenlightened condition of the slaves, and urged that they be allowed\r\nto work among them where they believed their efforts would accomplish\r\nmore than among the Indian tribes. The Society granted their requests\r\nand gave them special instructions to look after the spiritual\r\ninterests of all slaves.[1005] Their subsequent reports, though they\r\ndealt primarily with negro slaves, sometimes made mention of Indian\r\nslaves, and show that there was no distinction in religious matters\r\nbetween the slaves of the two races.\r\n\r\nA letter from Samuel Thomas to the Society, December 21, 1705, told\r\nof the employment of negro and Indian slaves on the Lord’s Day;[1006]\r\nbut in a memorial of the same year he rejoiced in the prospect of\r\nbringing many Indian and negro slaves to the knowledge and practice\r\nof Christianity.[1007] In a letter of the following year he urged\r\nthat the Society give the missionaries strict charge to labor with\r\ngreat diligence in the conversion of the Indian and negro slaves\r\nin the respective parishes.[1008] In 1710, he reported that there\r\nwas several unconverted Apalachee slaves in his parish whom he was\r\nespecially anxious to baptize.[1009] Le Jau, another missionary in\r\nSouth Carolina, reported, in 1708, that the masters opposed the baptism\r\nand marriage of their slaves, and declared that “many masters cannot be\r\npersuaded that negroes and Indians are otherwise than beasts and use\r\nthem like such”.[1010] In the same year he reported many Indian and\r\nnegro slaves instructed and on probation for baptism.[1011] In 1710,\r\nalso, certain masters had so far yielded in their opposition to the\r\nreligious training of slaves as to allow Indian and negro slaves to\r\nremain a half-hour after the services for instruction.[1012] In 1711,\r\none Indian slave and thirty negro slaves had joined the church in his\r\nparish,[1013] and he was catechizing “negroes and other slaves” with\r\ntheir masters’ consent,[1014] though then, and even at a later period,\r\nother masters in the same parish (Goose Creek) opposed his work among\r\nthe slaves.[1015] Where such consent was granted, the slaves were often\r\nrequired to declare that they were not being baptized out of any effort\r\nto free themselves.[1016] From still another South Carolina parish (St.\r\nThomas) the pastor, Haskell, wrote in 1711 that he was encouraging the\r\nconversion of Indian and negro slaves, and that he was also trying to\r\npersuade their masters to his mind.[1017] He met with some success, for\r\nanother letter of the same year recorded the baptism of two negroes\r\nand an Indian slave.[1018] As late as 1730, however, he reported that\r\nthe religious instruction of Indian and negro slaves was obstructed\r\nby irreligious and worldly people.[1019] In 1707, Dunn, the pastor\r\nof a parish thirty miles from Charleston reported that he met great\r\ndifficulty in persuading masters to allow their Indian and negro slaves\r\nto receive religious instruction or to be baptized, since they believed\r\nthat baptism would free slaves.[1020]\r\n\r\nThe same attitude of masters concerning the religious instruction of\r\ntheir slaves was reported from other colonies by the missionaries of\r\nthe Society in question. But since the number of Indian slaves in no\r\nother colony was as large as in South Carolina, the mention of them by\r\nthe missionaries is far less frequent, when made at all. Sharpe of New\r\nYork, in a letter of 1712, mentioned two Spanish Indian slaves who were\r\nChristians.[1021] Neau of New York reported much opposition of masters\r\nto his work among the slaves.[1022] But Governor Cornbury promised to\r\nhelp him,[1023] and evidently his labors were successful, for a report\r\nin 1726 alluded to fourteen hundred negro and Indian slaves, many of\r\nwhom had been instructed by Neau.[1024]\r\n\r\nSince in general the religious instruction of servants and slaves was\r\nrecognized as a duty by both the civil and ecclesiastical authorities\r\nin England, the response of the Society for the Propagation of the\r\nGospel in Foreign Parts to these letters and reports was encouraging,\r\nand the missionaries were directed to do all in their power for the\r\neducation and conversion of all slaves.[1025] On one occasion the\r\nSociety went so far as to draft a bill to be introduced into Parliament\r\nproviding for the more effectual conversion of negroes and servants in\r\nthe plantation,[1026] and also petitioned the Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nthat his majesty be requested to encourage the passage of laws in\r\nthe colonies to the effect that baptism did not confer freedom upon\r\nslaves.[1027]\r\n\r\nThe colonial clergy similarly tried to obtain legislation at home which\r\nmight serve to dispel the popular illusion that baptism conferred\r\nfreedom upon slaves. A proposition contained in Mr. Forbes’ account\r\nof the state of the church in Virginia, July 21, 1724, is a case in\r\npoint. It stated that the Christian duty of instructing and educating\r\nheathen slaves in the Christian faith was much neglected by slave\r\nowners in America, though recommended by his majesty’s instructions.\r\nIt was accordingly proposed that every Indian, negro or mulatto child\r\nthat should be baptized and publicly catechized by the minister in\r\nchurch, and who could, before the fourteenth year of his or her age,\r\ngive a distinct account of the creed, the Lord’s Prayer and the ten\r\ncommandments, should, if the owner received a certificate from the\r\nminister to that effect, be exempted from paying all levies till the\r\nage of eighteen years.[1028]\r\n\r\nLaws to this effect were passed in some of the colonies. The Carolina\r\nFundamental Constitutions of 1669 had provided that it should be\r\nlawful for slaves to become members of any church or religious\r\nprofession as if they were freemen, but that every owner should have\r\nabsolute power and authority over his slaves regardless of their\r\nopinion or religion.[1029] But by the so-called “Church Act” of 1705\r\nSouth Carolina showed itself averse to the policy advocated in the\r\nConstitutions of 1669, and decreed that the register of a parish\r\nshould except negro and Indian slaves from the entries of births,\r\nchristenings, marriages and burials.[1030] The law suited the times\r\nand was accordingly followed.[1031] But in 1712, in order to correct\r\nthe popular misconception that a Christianized slave was by law free,\r\nan act was passed to the effect that baptism of slaves did not confer\r\nfreedom upon them.[1032]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1655, the Virginia assembly had voted that Indian servants\r\nshould be educated and brought up in the Christian faith.[1033] Yet the\r\nidea that baptism conferred freedom upon a slave even then existed in\r\nthe colony, since one of the reasons given for the disallowance of the\r\nsale of an Indian boy by “The Kinge of Waineoke” to Elizabeth Short in\r\n1659 was that the boy was desirous of baptism.[1034] The above action\r\nof the legislature probably contributed to the enactment of the law of\r\n1667 which decreed that the baptism of a slave did not confer freedom\r\nupon him or in any way change his condition. The act naively declared\r\nthe reason for this legislative action to be that masters freed from\r\nthis doubt might the more carefully encourage the propagation of\r\nChristianity by permitting the conversion of slaves.[1035] The act of\r\n1670, when slaves were for the first time legally designated as such\r\nin Virginia, decreed that freedom resulting from Christianity was\r\nlimited to servants imported by shipping. Consequently Indian servants\r\nor slaves, since they generally came into the colony by land, were not\r\neligible to become freemen by the provision.[1036] The act of 1670 was\r\nrepealed in 1682 and a new act removed the possibility of conversion\r\nto Christianity conferring freedom upon any slaves, negro, mulatto or\r\nIndian, by decreeing that whether converted to Christianity before or\r\nafter being brought to the colony, they should remain slaves.[1037]\r\nFinally, in 1712, Virginia passed a law requiring that the parents of\r\nfree-born children and the owners of slave-born children, within twenty\r\ndays after the birth of a child, should give notice in writing of the\r\nbirth, with name and sex, the names of the parents of a free-born\r\nchild, and the name of the owner of a slave-born child. The death of\r\na slave was to be reported to the minister of the parish in the same\r\nway, and the minister was required to keep a record of all births and\r\ndeaths in his parish.[1038] Virginia parish registers after this date\r\ncontain records of the death of Indian slaves.[1039] Maryland, also, by\r\nthe acts of 1692,[1040] 1694,[1041] 1704[1042] and 1715[1043] sought\r\nto encourage the baptism of “negroes and other slaves” by asserting\r\nthat baptism did not confer freedom upon slaves or their offspring. In\r\naccordance with the instructions of Queen Anne to Governor Cornbury,\r\n1702, New Jersey passed an act in May, 1704, declaring that baptism of\r\nany negro, Indian or mulatto slave should not be considered reason or\r\ncause for his freedom.[1044]\r\n\r\nThe amended “Duke’s Laws” published about 1674, decreed that turning\r\nChristian should not set at liberty any negro or Indian servant in New\r\nYork who had been bought by any person.[1045] Evidently the colonists\r\nput but little faith in this provision, for Governor Dongan reported in\r\n1687 that they “take no care of the conversion of their slaves.”[1046]\r\nThe old idea that conversion conferred freedom upon slaves prevailed,\r\nand was doubtless strengthened by an order of the council, October 11,\r\n1687, that Christian Indians and children of Christian parents brought\r\nfrom Campeachy and Vera Cruz as slaves should be set free,[1047] and\r\nby a similar order in the following year that Spanish Indian slaves\r\nprofessing Christianity were to be released and sent home.[1048] This\r\nlast order was accompanied by a decree of the council, July 30, 1688,\r\nthat the Spanish Indian slaves of certain persons be brought before\r\nit with a view of liberating them if they were able to say the Lord’s\r\nPrayer.[1049] A report of Governor Bellomont, April 27, 1699, also,\r\nstates that a “Bill for facilitating the conversion of negroes and\r\nIndians ... would not go down with the assembly; they having a notion\r\nthat the negroes being converted to Christianity would emancipate\r\nthem from their slavery, and loose them from their service.”[1050]\r\nBut an act of October 24, 1706, “to encourage the Baptizing of Negro,\r\nIndian and Mulatto slaves” stated that the baptism of slaves did not\r\nconfer freedom upon them.[1051] This partially calmed the fears of the\r\nslave owners, and the baptism of slaves became more frequent;[1052]\r\nbut it did not lead the owners in all cases to favor the work of the\r\nmissionaries among the slaves. In 1724, Mr. Jenney reported to the\r\nSociety for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts: “There\r\nare a few negroes and Indian slaves ... in my parish: the catechist,\r\na school-master from the honorable society, has often proposed to\r\nteach them the catechism, but we cannot prevail upon their masters\r\nto spare them from their labor for that good work.”[1053] Again, in\r\n1728, Mr. Wetmore reported the opposition of Quaker, Presbyterian\r\nand Episcopalian masters to the instruction and baptism of their\r\nslaves,[1054] but in 1734 he alluded to the baptism of one adult Indian\r\nslave.[1055]\r\n\r\nIn New England the earliest action taken by the colonial government\r\nwith regard to the religious instruction of slaves occurred in 1677\r\nin connection with the disposal as slaves of the captives taken in\r\nKing Philip’s War, when it was decreed that all the Indian slaves\r\ndistributed among the inhabitants of the colony should “be taught and\r\ninstructed in the Christian religion.”[1056] How far such religious\r\ntraining was carried out would be difficult to ascertain. Occasional\r\nglimpses of the situation can be obtained. Experience Mayhew lamented\r\nthat all the English did not instruct their servants in the “principles\r\nof the true religion”;[1057] though he cited instances when Indian\r\nservants, some of whom may have been slaves, were so instructed.[1058]\r\nJust how much missionary work was done in the homes of Massachusetts\r\nor elsewhere for the conversion of Indian servants and slaves is not\r\nknown. Indian slaves were owned by ministers of the gospel, and it\r\nmay be supposed that some attention was given to their instruction.\r\nEvidently the religious spirit of the Massachusetts colonists was\r\nsufficiently strong to include Indian slaves and servants, for in\r\nsome churches negroes and Indians had a special location assigned\r\nthem in the church[1059] and occasional reference is found to Indian\r\nslaves being church members. According to the baptismal records of\r\nNovember 19, 1727, for example, the Indian slave of Lieutenant Stephen\r\nLongfellow, great-great-grandfather of the poet, was his fellow member\r\nin the Byfield church.[1060] In this same year the Reverend Timothy\r\nCutler reported from Boston: “Negro and Indian slaves belonging to my\r\nparish are about thirty-two, their education is according to the houses\r\nthey belong to. I have baptized but two. But I know of the masters of\r\nsome others who are disposed to this important good of their slaves and\r\nare preparing them for it; however, there is too great a remissness\r\nupon this article”.[1061] In Rhode Island, also, for a long period the\r\nslaves were excluded from the church because their owners considered\r\nchurch membership to be inconsistent with their position. Finally in\r\n1721 James MacSparran, pastor of Narragansett, protested against\r\ndenying slaves the benefit of religious instruction and activities,\r\nand carried his point.[1062] After that date Indian and other slaves\r\ncould belong to the churches, though baptism and membership were still\r\nheld in disfavor by the slave owners.[1063] Connecticut, too, in 1727,\r\nfavored the work of the church by enacting that masters and mistresses\r\nof Indian children were to use their utmost endeavors to instruct them\r\nin the Christian faith.[1064]\r\n\r\nThe popular idea that baptism conferred freedom upon slaves aroused\r\neventually so much discussion among both the colonists and the\r\nrepresentatives of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel\r\nin Foreign Parts, and so many inquiries were addressed to the home\r\ngovernment concerning the matter, that in 1729 the opinions of Talbot\r\nand Yorke, the attorney and solicitor generals of England, were\r\nexpressed on the subject. Their decision was in accord with the acts\r\nof the various colonial legislatures to the effect that baptism did\r\nnot confer freedom upon slaves. The declaration of Gibson, Bishop of\r\nLondon, about the same time, also, that “Christianity and the embracing\r\nof the Gospels does not make the least alteration in civil property”,\r\npractically ended the discussion.[1065]\r\n\r\nTurning now to a consideration of the question of manumission, it\r\nmay be said that an Indian slave, like a negro of like condition,\r\nmight obtain freedom during the latter’s lifetime, or by testamentary\r\ndisposition at the owner’s death. His freedom might be purchased\r\neither by himself or others. A colonial court might declare him free\r\nif it were found that he was illegally held or misused. A colonial\r\ngovernment, also, might grant him freedom for some special service\r\nrendered.\r\n\r\nAction of the owner was naturally the most common way of conferring\r\nfreedom.[1066] When freedom was bestowed during the owner’s lifetime,\r\na deed of manumission was usually given in order to avoid future\r\ncomplications.[1067] Occasionally in special instances the colonial\r\ngovernment recognized such action of the slave owners as legal. For\r\ninstance, the South Carolina Board of Counsel, August 3, 1711, in\r\nits directions to the Indian traders provided that any Indians taken\r\ncaptive in war and declared free by their respective masters who had a\r\nright so to act, should be deemed free men.[1068]\r\n\r\nRecord exists of Indian slaves purchasing their freedom from two\r\nsources, viz.: the colonial governments that held them before they\r\nwere transferred to individual owners, and the individual masters\r\nthemselves. In Plymouth, March 5, 1668, it was ordered that a certain\r\nIndian held at Boston “for matter of fact”, since there was “a\r\nprobability of a tender of some land for his ransom from being sent\r\nto Barbadoes”, should be freed from such slavery on the tender of the\r\nland in question.[1069] A similar instance occurred in Connecticut. One\r\nof the earliest land grants of that colony was conveyed to its owner\r\nby the Indian chief, Uncas, in 1678, in exchange for Betty, an Indian\r\nwoman taken captive in King Philip’s War.[1070] Experience Mayhew\r\nrelates the instance of an Indian slave who, after his master’s death,\r\npurchased his freedom from his mistress on easy terms, “his master\r\nhaving never designed to keep him a slave all his days”.[1071] Another\r\ninstance, in 1709, shows an Indian slave woman sold to a free Indian to\r\nbecome his wife, in return for certain land.[1072]\r\n\r\nBy South Carolina law, an Indian slave was given a chance to prove his\r\nright to freedom. According to the act of 1712, any negro, mulatto,\r\nmustee or Indian slave, claiming freedom for certain reasons specified\r\nin the act, had the right to have his case heard and determined by\r\ngovernor and council.[1073] The act was repeated in 1722.[1074] By the\r\nterms of the acts of 1735[1075] and 1740,[1076] any slave might apply\r\nto the justices of the Court of Common Pleas by petition or motion. The\r\ncourt would then appoint a guardian for “said negro or Indian, mulatto\r\nor mestizo”; and, after hearing evidence, would render decision. The\r\nalleged owner might defend himself, and if the plaintiff were declared\r\nfree, the jury might award damages to the defendant. If the defendant\r\nshould win the case, the court might inflict such corporal punishment\r\non the plaintiff as it should see fit, not extending to danger to\r\nlife or limb. The burden of proof was to lie with the plaintiff, and\r\nany such negro, Indian, etc., was to be considered a slave until the\r\ncontrary was proved. Other courts of the province besides the one\r\nmentioned, were to have similar jurisdiction in the matter.\r\n\r\nCertain of the colonies specified how slaves might be emancipated. In\r\n1723, Virginia declared that no negro, mulatto or Indian slave was to\r\nbe set free upon any pretense whatever except for some meritorious\r\nservice, to be adjudged and allowed by the governor and council for the\r\ntime being, and a license therefor first obtained. If any slave should\r\nbe set free by his owner in any other way, it was declared lawful for\r\nthe churchwardens of the parish wherein such slave should reside for\r\nthe space of one month following his being freed, to take up and sell\r\nthe said negro, mulatto or Indian as a slave at the next court held for\r\nthe county.[1077] North Carolina, similarly, in 1741, provided that no\r\nslave was to be freed except for meritorious service, to be adjudged\r\nand allowed by license of the county court. If any owner should free\r\nhis slave in any other way, the church wardens of the parish wherein\r\nsuch “negro, mulatto or Indian” should be found at the expiration of\r\nsix months after the manumission, were authorized and required to sell\r\nthe said negro, mulatto or Indian as a slave at the next session of the\r\ncounty court.[1078]\r\n\r\nThe colonial governments themselves granted freedom to Indian slaves\r\non special occasions. By an act passed in 1660, Virginia provided that\r\nan Indian sold by another Indian, or an Indian who spoke the English\r\nlanguage and who might desire baptism, should be given his or her\r\nfreedom.[1079] In 1675, also, the Massachusetts general court freed the\r\nsister of an Indian whose friendship it wished to assure. The alleged\r\nowner of the slave being able to prove his title, the court ordered\r\nthat £5 be paid for the slave’s liberty.[1080]\r\n\r\nAt the time of King Philip’s War the general courts of Massachusetts\r\nBay and Plymouth reserved the privilege, not only of disposing of\r\ncaptives as slaves, but also of taking these slaves away from their\r\nowners and giving them their liberty if such action seemed advisable.\r\nIn March, 1679, the Massachusetts general court made reparation in\r\nmoney to the master of an Indian slave, when for some reason the\r\ncourt freed the slave.[1081] The Plymouth general court, June 3,\r\n1679, ordered the release of a certain Indian woman and her husband\r\nupon the payment by the woman’s brothers of £6 in New England silver\r\nmoney.[1082] The same order provided in the case of a “younger Indian”\r\nthat he should remain with his master until twenty-four years old,\r\nand then be given his freedom.[1083] Like action was taken in 1714\r\nwhen the owner of an Indian slave petitioned the Massachusetts\r\ngeneral court for the payment of £25, “the prime cost which he paid\r\nfor an Indian boy lately called out of his hands to be returned to\r\nthe Indians at the time of the late pacification, besides charges in\r\nkeeping and clothing of him and for doctors”.[1084] Just prior to\r\nChurch’s expedition in King Philip’s War, furthermore, as a military\r\nmeasure to prevent conspiracy among the Indians in the colony and their\r\nunion with the warring tribes, Massachusetts decreed that any Indian\r\nservant discovering any dangerous plot or conspiracy of Indians should\r\nbe emancipated, and his master be paid out of the public treasury a\r\nreasonable price for his services.[1085]\r\n\r\nSome of the colonies considered it advisable to make regulations\r\nregarding the Indians after emancipation. A Virginia act of 1670\r\nspecified that former Indian slaves “though baptized and enjoined their\r\nown freedom” could not purchase Christian white servants. The law did\r\nnot debar them, however, from buying any of their own race.[1086]\r\nBoth New York by the act of 1712,[1087] and New Jersey by the act of\r\n1713,[1088] decreed that no freed Indian could hold any real estate\r\nproperty in the colony concerned. South Carolina and North Carolina,\r\nalso, regarded the presence of manumitted Indians in the colony as\r\nundesirable. The possibility that freedmen of this sort might stir up\r\ndisturbance among their fellows who remained in slavery was too great\r\na risk. A South Carolina act of 1722 decreed that, if owners freed any\r\nslave, they must make provision for his passage out of the province.\r\nSuch freedman, if he did not leave the province within twelve months\r\nafter his manumission (being at liberty to do so) would lose the\r\nbenefit of his emancipation, and continue to be a slave, unless the\r\nmanumission were confirmed by both houses of the legislature.[1089] A\r\nfurther act of 1735 required that the slave when manumitted should quit\r\nthe province within the period of six months following his manumission,\r\nand not return within seven years.[1090] The North Carolina act of 1741\r\nspecified that, if any freedman did not depart from the province within\r\nsix months following his manumission, or should thereafter return to\r\nthe province, the church wardens of the parish where he might be at the\r\nend of one month after his return, were to sell him at public auction\r\nat the next session of the county court.[1091]\r\n\r\nThe freeing of slaves who after their manumission might possess no\r\nmeans of support and in consequence become a burden upon the community,\r\npresented a problem that often needed attention. Connecticut understood\r\nthe value of freeing worn-out slaves so as to avoid supporting them in\r\ntheir time of uselessness; hence in 1702 the general court enacted that\r\nevery slave owner who freed his slave should in the years following\r\nmanumission, if the former slave came to want, meet the expense which\r\nthe local government encountered in caring for the freedman.[1092]\r\nThe act was renewed by the court in 1703.[1093] Another act of\r\npractically the same tenor and including “Spanish Indians” was passed\r\nin 1711.[1094] An act of 1777, also, relieved the former owner of a\r\nfreedman from any obligation to contribute to his support if the act\r\nof manumission had been sanctioned in due form by the selectmen of the\r\nformer owner’s town.[1095]\r\n\r\nA New York law of 1712, on the other hand, provided that any one\r\nmanumitting “any negro, Indian or mulatto slave” should give security\r\nof not less than £200 to pay yearly to such freed slave the sum of\r\n£20 lawful money of the colony. If the slave were freed by will\r\nand testament, the executors of the deceased person were required\r\nto give the same security after probate. If such security were not\r\ngiven, the manumission should be void.[1096] Since the law proved to\r\nbe unsatisfactory, in 1717 it was amended so as to provide that any\r\nmaster or other person manumitting an Indian or negro slave should give\r\nsecurity at the General Sessions of the Peace for city and county where\r\nsuch freed Indian or negro should reside, to keep such freedman from\r\nbecoming a charge on the city, town or place.[1097]\r\n\r\nNew Jersey, too, in 1713, passed an act declaring that no negro or\r\nmulatto slave could be manumitted unless the slave’s master gave surety\r\nto pay such freed slave £20 yearly.[1098] This is the only section\r\nof the act which did not include Indian slaves in its provisions.\r\nEvidently the omission was unsatisfactory, for a later act, November\r\n16, 1769, repealed the section and provided that, if any owner should\r\nby will or otherwise free “any negro, Indian or mulatto slave”, then\r\nsuch owner, his heirs or executors, at the next session of the Court of\r\nGeneral Quarter Sessions of the Peace in the county where such owner\r\nresided, must give a bond of £200, so as to indemnify the community if\r\nsuch freedman became a pauper.[1099]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                     +The Decline of Indian Slavery+\r\n\r\n\r\nThe small number of the Indians within the territory actually occupied\r\nby the English had its influence upon both the extent and the decline\r\nof Indian slavery. The Indians were never as numerous in the English\r\nterritory as in that occupied or claimed by the Spanish and French.\r\nFrom many estimates made of the Indian population in the section under\r\nEnglish rule,[1100] it would seem that the supply was sufficient to\r\nnourish the system of Indian slavery indefinitely: but it must be noted\r\nthat the greater portion of this Indian population was made up of\r\ntribes generally remote from the English settlements.\r\n\r\nThe consensus of opinion to-day is that the number of Indians in\r\nNew England about the year 1600 was not greater than twenty-four or\r\ntwenty-five thousand. This number was so much reduced by the plague of\r\n1616,[1101] that Palfrey states that the English found practically a\r\nvacant domain.[1102] In the Florida country many small tribes were so\r\nthoroughly exterminated before the coming of the whites that no trace\r\nof their existence remained except a few local names.[1103] In the\r\ninterior of the continent before the French or the English had obtained\r\na foothold, the whole country during the seventeenth century was the\r\nseat of intertribal wars so disastrous in their results as to destroy\r\nmany large and powerful tribes.[1104]\r\n\r\nWith the coming of the white races the decrease in the number of the\r\nIndians went on rapidly. Estimates show such to have been the case with\r\nthe Indians of the North Atlantic coast during the first quarter of\r\nthe eighteenth century.[1105] Bradford[1106] and Winthrop[1107] bear\r\nwitness to the small number of the natives, and to the further decrease\r\nof that number after the coming of the whites. An early writer on New\r\nYork declares: “There is now (1670) but few Indians upon the island and\r\nthose few no ways hurtful. It is to be admired how strangely they have\r\ndecreased by the hand of God, since the English first settling in these\r\nparts.”[1108] Oldmixon gives the number of Indian men in New York in\r\n1708 as one thousand, “whereas there are seven or eight times as many\r\nEnglish.”[1109] According to the same authority, the number of Indians\r\nin New Jersey at the opening of the eighteenth century did not exceed\r\ntwo hundred.[1110]\r\n\r\nA decreased birth-rate was not the least important cause of this\r\ndecrease in numbers throughout all the tribes. Following the advent of\r\nthe whites in the new world, “sterility became the rule and not the\r\nexception”, where before the Indians were very prolific.[1111] The\r\nnatives, bond or free, seemed to possess a peculiar susceptibility\r\nto the diseases of the whites, and a lack of ability to withstand\r\ntheir effects. The Indians of the Delaware River country complained\r\nthat during the sixteen years after the coming of the Swedes, their\r\nnumber had been much diminished, presumably by small-pox.[1112] In\r\nboth North and South Carolina, the Indians were much afflicted by\r\nthis same disease in early colonial days, one tribe being entirely\r\nswept away,[1113] another nearly exhausted,[1114] and still others\r\nmuch reduced in numbers.[1115] Owing to diseases and other causes the\r\nseveral tribes in Carolina at the opening of the eighteenth century\r\nwere small, most of them not numbering more than fifty men each.[1116]\r\nDouglass recorded that the Spanish Indians captured at St. Augustine\r\nand brought to New England, soon died of consumption.[1117]\r\n\r\nDean Berkeley who repeatedly visited Narragansett to examine the\r\nconditions and character of the Indians of that locality, in his sermon\r\nbefore the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts\r\nat its anniversary in 1731, bears witness to such destruction in the\r\nfollowing statement: “The native Indians, who are said to have been\r\nthousands within the compass of this colony, do not at present amount\r\nto a thousand, including every age and sect; ... the English [having]\r\ncontributed more to destroy their bodies by the use of strong liquors,\r\nthan by any means to improve their minds or save their souls. This slow\r\npoison, jointly operating with the small-pox, and their wars, (but much\r\nmore destructive than both), has consumed the Indians, not only in our\r\ncolonies, but also far and wide upon our confines.”[1118]\r\n\r\nIntestine wars, often, as has been seen, fostered by the whites,\r\nresulted in great loss of numbers to the Indians, and sometimes even\r\ndestroyed whole tribes. In consequence of a war between the Yoamaco\r\nIndians of Maryland and the Susquehanna, the former disappeared.[1119]\r\nIn Virginia, between 1609 and 1669, spirituous liquors, the small-pox,\r\nwar and a diminution of territory reduced the tribes to one-third of\r\ntheir original number.[1120] During the next twenty years they had\r\nbecome so much weakened that three of their principal tribes were able\r\nto send to a great Indian congress only four representatives, including\r\nattendants. By the end of the next century all had perished, except\r\nthree or four of one tribe, ten or twelve of another, and a few women\r\nonly of a third.[1121]\r\n\r\nBy 1780 all the Indian nations of the territory settled by the\r\nEnglish in the south were either extinct or had retreated westward\r\nand had united with the neighboring Cherokee and Creeks. At this\r\ntime the Catawba were so reduced that they possessed but seventy or\r\neighty men.[1122] The Westo and Savannah were likewise reduced from\r\nmany thousands to small numbers,[1123] and the Corannine tribe was\r\npractically destroyed.[1124]\r\n\r\nAnother cause which contributed in a measure to the passing of Indian\r\nslavery was the amalgamation of the red and black slaves. Since\r\nintercourse and marriage of slaves were not generally interfered with\r\nby the whites, it was natural that the slaves of the red and black\r\nraces should intermingle. Since, also, the Indians were generally\r\nin the minority, as well as inferior in power of resistance, their\r\nphysical characteristics gradually disappeared, while those of the\r\nnegro remained.\r\n\r\nBy his very constitution, furthermore, the Indian seemed unfitted for\r\nservitude. He was highly susceptible to climatic changes, and unable to\r\nendure sustained labor. In his native condition he was accustomed at\r\ntimes to great tests of physical endurance, which, however, alternated\r\nwith periods of rest and recuperation. Though authorities may differ\r\nas to the capacity of the Indian for civilization, the fact remains\r\nthat civilization has only to a very small extent been assimilated\r\nby the red man. Taking into due consideration the treatment accorded\r\nhim by the whites, the conclusion seems warranted that such lack of\r\nassimilation is due in some measure to the inability of the Indian to\r\ndevelop beyond the stage which he had already reached when discovered\r\nby the Europeans. Furthermore, the dominant idea of Indian life was the\r\nlove of liberty. Heredity and environment coöperated to make the Indian\r\na creature opposed to all restraint when exercised by an exterior\r\nforce.[1125]\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion, therefore, so far as it can be determined by\r\nindividual testimony, colonial legislative action and the comparative\r\nvalues of Indian and negro slaves, is that Indian slave labor within\r\nthe territory under discussion was not, as a rule, satisfactory. Mason\r\nrecords that the captives distributed among the colonists as slaves\r\nat the close of the Pequot War “could not endure that yoke; few of\r\nthem continuing any considerable time with their masters”.[1126]\r\nMayhew tells in 1690 of the tendency to run away shown by the Indian\r\nslaves of Massachusetts.[1127] Moses Marcy of Oxford, Massachusetts,\r\nhad an Indian woman sold him by the general court prior to 1747. In\r\nthat year he was discharged from his bond, she having “made way with\r\nherself after having tried to murder her mistress ... run off and not\r\nheard from since”.[1128] It is stated that the Indian female slaves\r\nof New England could not be taught to sew, to wash clothes, or to\r\nrender any valuable domestic service;[1129] and that the Indian slaves\r\nof Rhode Island “only became efficient workmen under a stern and\r\nvigorous discipline”.[1130] Sir Robert Mountgomry, who advocated in\r\n1717 the establishment of a colony south of Carolina, urged the use of\r\nindentured white servants, so that there might be “no necessity to use\r\nthe dangerous help of Blackamoors or Indians”.[1131]\r\n\r\nThe various laws, already discussed in another connection, and the\r\nnumerous newspaper advertisements show Indian slaves to have been as\r\nmuch given to running away as their negro companions. In fact it seems\r\nnot unlikely that they were more inclined toward trying to escape, for\r\nthe possible chance of returning to their own people offered greater\r\ninducements for such an act than in the case of negroes.\r\n\r\nIndian slaves as well as negroes were implicated in the various\r\nslave disturbances which occurred from time to time in the different\r\ncolonies. Though there seems no evidence that Indians were usually more\r\ninstrumental than negroes in creating these disturbances, yet their not\r\ninfrequent participation in such events tended to lower the colonists’\r\nestimate of their value, and led to definite legislation seeking, by\r\npreventive measures and by decreeing severe punishments in case of\r\nconspiracies or uprisings, to avoid the danger which the colonists\r\nfeared.\r\n\r\nLegislation regarding slave conspiracies and uprisings was general\r\nthroughout the English colonies from an early date. In some of\r\nthese acts Indian slaves were expressly mentioned. In others they\r\nwere included by implication in the general term “slaves” or in the\r\nexpression “negroes and other slaves”. Reference will be made to only\r\nthose acts which include Indian slaves by express mention. A South\r\nCarolina act of 1690 related to Indian and negro slaves striking a\r\nwhite person.[1132] The Spanish Indians were evidently considered\r\nespecially undesirable, for an act passed in 1722 stated that “the\r\nimportation of Spanish Indians, mustees, negroes and mulattoes may be\r\nof dangerous consequence....”[1133] In 1703, Massachusetts passed “an\r\nact to prevent disorder in the night”. The preamble reads: “whereas\r\ngreat disorders, insolences and burglaries are oftimes raised and\r\ncommitted in the night time by Indian, negro and mulatto servants\r\nand slaves....”[1134] As late as 1769 Connecticut passed an act\r\nrelating to any disturbance created by “any Indian, negro, or mulatto\r\nslave.”[1135] The murder by an Indian man slave and a negro woman of\r\nan entire white family in Queens County, New York, led to the passage\r\nof an act, October 30, 1708, to prevent the conspiracy of Indian and\r\nnegro slaves.[1136] A Philadelphia ordinance, also, of July 3, 1738,\r\ndealt with “the tumultuous meetings and other disorderly doings of\r\nthe negroes, mulattoes and Indian servants and slaves within the\r\ncity”.[1137]\r\n\r\nA second class of colonial laws related to Indian slaves alone and\r\nshow that in certain of the colonies the inhabitants, for definite\r\nreasons, feared the presence of too many Indian slaves among them.\r\nSuch were the laws passed by the northern colonies at the time of\r\nthe Tuscarora War, by which they sought by means of heavy duties to\r\nprevent the importation of such dangerous slaves.[1138] The preamble\r\nof the Massachusetts act of 1713, for example, reads: “Whereas divers\r\nconspiracies, outrages, barbarities, murders, burglaries, thefts and\r\nother notorious crimes and enormities, at sundry times, and especially\r\nof late, have been perpetuated and committed by Indian and other slaves\r\nwithin several of her majestie’s plantations in America, being of a\r\nmalicious, surley and revengeful spirit, rude and insolent in their\r\nbehaviour, and very ungovernable, the over-great number and increase\r\nwhereof within this province is likely to prove of pernicious and\r\nfatal consequences to her majestie’s subjects and interest here unless\r\nspeedily remedied, and is a discouragement to the importation of white\r\nChristian servants, this province being differently circumstanced from\r\nthe plantations in the islands, and having great numbers of the Indian\r\nnatives of the country within and about them, and at this time under\r\nthe sorrowful effects of their rebellion and hostilities....”[1139] The\r\nConnecticut act passed in August, 1715, likewise for the purpose of\r\nchecking the importation of Indians into the colony, is a transcript\r\nof the Massachusetts act and shows that the colonists considered a\r\nlarge Indian slave element in the population to be quite as undesirable\r\nas did the people of Massachusetts.[1140] The New Hampshire act of\r\n1714 cited as a reason for checking the importation of Indians: “the\r\nover-great number and increase of such slaves within the province is\r\nlikely to prove of fatal and pernicious consequences to her majesty’s\r\nsubjects and interests here unless speedily remedied”.[1141] The\r\nRhode Island act of July 5, 1715, similarly was passed to prevent\r\nthe importation of Indian slaves, because “divers conspiracies,\r\ninsurrections, rapes, thefts, and other execrable crimes have been\r\nlately perpetrated in this and the adjoining colonies by Indian slaves,\r\netc.”[1142]\r\n\r\nAgain, it seems not unlikely that the use of hired Indian servants may\r\nhave had something to do with the passing of Indian slavery, though\r\nthe influence was probably slight. Very early in the history of the\r\nnorthern colonies, Indians were employed for wages. The need for\r\nlaborers could thus be partly met at very little cost. A Frenchman\r\nresiding in Boston in 1687, records the wages of such servants who\r\nworked in the fields as “a shilling and a half a day and board which is\r\neighteen pence”.[1143]\r\n\r\nThe number of such Indians employed was generally small. As a hired\r\nlaborer the Indian was no more reliable or trustworthy than as a\r\nslave. The keeping of Indians in the colonists’ families was always\r\nconsidered to be more or less dangerous. Massachusetts, in 1631,[1144]\r\nand Virginia, in 1661,[1145] required that all persons should get\r\nspecial licenses before employing Indians. In 1634, Winthrop and his\r\nson did so. Winthrop himself speaks of the “Indians which are in\r\nour families”,[1146] and mention of his Indian servant is found in\r\nother connections.[1147] As the colony grew stronger and the fear of\r\nthe Indians passed away, other leading men of Massachusetts, such as\r\nThomas Morton,[1148] the Reverend Mr. Pariss,[1149] Isaac Addington,\r\nsecretary of the Council of Safety in 1714,[1150] and John Eliot[1151]\r\nemployed such servants. The law was repealed in 1646, “there being\r\nmore use of encouragement thereto than otherwise.”[1152] That a\r\nsimilar employment of Indians existed in Plymouth is seen by the\r\nact of 1651 which shows the danger to the colony in providing such\r\nservants with firearms.[1153] The Praying Indians hired themselves\r\nto the whites.[1154] The New England whale fisheries employed hired\r\nIndians, at least from 1670 to 1680.[1155] During the publication of\r\nthe New Testament in Massachusetts in 1661, and the translation of\r\nthe New and Old Testaments and the Psalms into the Indian language by\r\nJohn Eliot in 1663, Green, the printer, was assisted in his work by\r\nan Indian apprentice.[1156] In Little Compton, Massachusetts, hired\r\nIndians were largely engaged in building stone fences.[1157] In 1659\r\nand 1660, the people of Connecticut were employing the Mohegan Indians\r\nin agricultural labor,[1158] and the use of hired Indians is reported\r\nin the colony in 1774.[1159] By 1731 most of the Indians remaining\r\nin Narragansett were servants in families.[1160] The records also of\r\nSouthampton, New York, show the employment of Indians for hire.[1161]\r\n\r\nIt was a part of the Puritan missionary scheme to win the heathen to\r\nChristianity by employing them in their homes where they might be\r\nbrought into contact with the workings of the Christian religion. In\r\nthis manner they hoped to bring the savages to a state preparatory\r\nto conversion.[1162] Something of the same purpose was intended by\r\nthe early Virginia colonists. Hence, in 1619, their first legislative\r\nassembly ordered that every plantation should procure Indian youths\r\nby just means for this purpose.[1163] In 1774, the governor of\r\nConnecticut, in reply to various inquiries made by the home government\r\nregarding conditions in the colony, stated that there were then\r\n1,363 Indians in the colony, and that many of them dwelt in English\r\nfamilies.[1164] A similar statement was made in 1731 by Dean Berkeley\r\nto the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. He\r\ndeclared that nearly all the native Indians of Rhode Island were at\r\nthat time servants or laborers for the English.[1165]\r\n\r\nSome of the earliest of the indentured servants used in America,\r\nmoreover, were Indians. Reference has already been made to the\r\nMassachusetts law of 1700 seeking to avoid the abuse of the custom.\r\nIn 1674, Plymouth passed a law providing that both Indians who lived\r\nidly and those who did not pay their debts on conviction could be\r\nhanded over to those to whom they were indebted or to others as bond\r\nservants.[1166] The Southold town records mention Indian apprentices\r\nin 1678.[1167] Indentured male and female Indians existed in Salem\r\nin 1685.[1168] Similar records of Indian apprentices and indentured\r\nservants exist for Rhode Island,[1169] Connecticut,[1170] New\r\nJersey[1171] and New York.[1172] As a rule these bond servants were\r\nyoung, for they were then more easily trained and were more tractable\r\nand useful. In Virginia, in every agreement between Indian parents and\r\nwhites, a covenant had to be entered into providing that the child be\r\ninstructed in the Christian religion.[1173]\r\n\r\nOne of the most important causes for the passing of Indian slavery is\r\nfound in the introduction of indentured white servants. Almost from the\r\ntime of the earliest settlements these servants were an institution in\r\nthe English colonies. Some of them were persons who entered voluntarily\r\ninto temporary bond service to pay for passage to the new world.[1174]\r\nSome were prisoners of war.[1175] Others were convicts sent into\r\nexile for punishment.[1176] These white servants were so much desired\r\nby the colonists that requests were not infrequently sent to England\r\nfor them.[1177] To encourage their voluntary coming, the colonial\r\nauthorities sometimes offered them special inducements.[1178]\r\n\r\nThe number of such servants in the different colonies varied according\r\nto conditions in America and England. Naturally their number was\r\ngreatest where their work was most needed.[1179] Whatever their\r\ncondition before coming to America and whatever the reason for their\r\ncoming,[1180] their productivity of labor, native intelligence and\r\nacquaintance with the customs and observances of civilization made\r\nthem more desirable than Indian servants. There were forces, also,\r\nurging them to go to America, and forces in America drawing them\r\nthere. So, until the development of the traffic in negroes, and their\r\nconsequent greater use, the indentured white servants were for a while\r\nperhaps the leading factor in the decline of Indian slavery.\r\n\r\nAnother element that contributed greatly to the decline of Indian\r\nslavery was that furnished by negro slaves. The rapidly increasing\r\nnumber of negroes in each individual colony attested both the energy of\r\ntrading companies and the desire of the colonies for the negro type of\r\nslave labor. Both indentured white servants and negro slaves, in fact,\r\nfar outnumbered the Indian slaves. The sources from which the white\r\nservants and the negro slaves were drawn were well nigh inexhaustible,\r\nwhereas the sources of Indian slavery were limited. From these limited\r\nsources, also, the colonists drew but in a small degree. White servants\r\nand negro slaves were obtained by peaceful means, but the acquisition\r\nof Indian slaves not infrequently meant danger to the colony. Behind\r\nthe indentured white servants and the negroes there were powerful\r\nforces supplying them to the colonists in some cases even faster than\r\nthey needed them. Both indentured white servants and negroes proved\r\nmore easily fitted to the life and work required of them by their\r\nmasters, their labor was more productive and they were more easily\r\ncontrolled.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the relative values attached to Indian and negro slaves\r\nmay be obtained by a comparison of the prices for which they were\r\nsold. In Massachusetts, for instance, record exists of the sale of\r\nan Indian man slave in Newbury, in 1649, for “the quarter part of a\r\nvessel”.[1181] Sewall records that on July 1, 1676, nine Indians were\r\nsold for £30.[1182] An inventory of 1690, on the other hand, appraised\r\na single negro at £30.[1183] In the inventory of an estate in Ipswich,\r\nin 1683, “Lawrence ye Indian” was valued at £4.[1184] In the same\r\ntown £5 was paid for an Indian boy and girl.[1185] The Reverend Mr.\r\nThacher of Milton, in 1674, paid £5 down and £5 more at the end of the\r\nyear for an Indian woman slave.[1186] An Indian girl brought £15 at\r\nSalem in 1710;[1187] whereas in the case of a cargo of negroes brought\r\ninto Boston in 1727, as high as £80 was paid per head.[1188] In the\r\nsettlement of an estate in Newbury, an Indian slave was valued at an\r\nearly date at £20.[1189] In 1708, a South Carolina Indian boy was sold\r\nfor £35.[1190] In 1713, a Spanish Indian boy was sold in the same town\r\nfor £38.[1191] In 1725, a negro was sold in Newbury for £100, and three\r\nother negroes were valued at £132 6s. 8d. in colonial currency.[1192]\r\nIn 1708, an Indian was sold at Salem for £32.[1193] An Indian girl was\r\nsold in the same town in 1710 for £15.[1194] A negro was appraised in\r\nthe same town at £40.[1195] In 1764, a negro woman was sold for £8\r\n13s. 4d.[1196] In Byfield a negro was listed in the inventory of an\r\nestate in 1689 at £60.[1197] A negro given to Cotton Mather in 1706 was\r\npurchased at an expense of £40 or £50.[1198] An Indian boy was valued\r\nin Boston in 1721 at £20, and an Indian girl at £10.[1199]\r\n\r\nIn Rhode Island the prices of Indian slaves were lower than those\r\nalready mentioned, for here the Indians were sold into slavery for\r\nlimited periods only. The average price at which Indians “great and\r\nsmall” were sold in the colony, was about thirty-two shillings. Some\r\nof the lot brought into Rhode Island at the close of King Philip’s\r\nWar sold for twelve bushels of Indian corn, some for £2 10s. in\r\nsilver, some for 100 pounds of wool, one for three fat sheep, two for\r\ntwenty-two bushels of Indian corn.[1200] One sold in 1677 at Portsmouth\r\nfor £4 10s.[1201] Indian slaves appear among other effects in the\r\nprobate inventories. They were appraised at £8 and £10 each, while\r\nnegroes were valued at from £60 to £80,[1202] with an average price of\r\n£50 for an able negro man and £40 for a woman.[1203] That is, a negro\r\nlaborer was reckoned as the equivalent of five or six Indians.[1204]\r\nIn 1718, three Indian children were worth £23.[1205] An inventory in\r\n1723 valued the two years and ten months’ service of an Indian girl at\r\n£5.[1206]\r\n\r\nThe inventory of the estate of Gabriel Harris who died in 1684 in New\r\nLondon, Connecticut, contained the item: “An Indian maid servant,\r\nvalued at £15.”[1207] An Indian slave of Wethersfield was appraised in\r\n1662 at £24. A negress and child belonging to the same estate were at\r\nthe same time appraised at £22.[1208] In Derby, Connecticut, an Indian\r\nwoman, twenty-six years old, sold in 1722 for £60.[1209]\r\n\r\nThe inventory of a New Jersey estate, in 1714, included an Indian man\r\nvalued at £11 5s.[1210] In another inventory, in 1725, an Indian woman\r\nwas valued at £30.[1211] In 1711, an Indian woman and two children were\r\nvalued at £100.[1212] Similar inventories valued an Indian girl in 1696\r\nat £30;[1213] an Indian woman in 1724 at £30;[1214] an Indian boy in\r\n1711 at £40;[1215] ... two Indian slaves in 1726 at £80; and two Indian\r\nslaves in 1730 at £50.[1216]\r\n\r\nThe account book of the executor of Thomas Smallcomb of York County,\r\nVirginia, 1646, contains the following items:[1217] “By two Indians\r\nsold by Sir William Berkeley, 600 lbs. By two Indians sold by Sir\r\nJohn Hammon, 500 lbs. By two Indians sold by Captain Thomas Petters,\r\n600 lbs.” In the records of Surrey County, 1659, occurs the following\r\ndeed: “Know all men by these presents, that I, King of Waineoakes, do\r\nfirmly bargaine and make sale unto Eliz. Short, her heires, executors\r\nor Assignes a boy of my nacon, named Weetoppen, from the day and date\r\nherself untill the full terme of his life, in consideracon whereof I,\r\nthe said Elizabeth Short, doth for myself, my heires, executors or\r\nAssignes ingage to deliver and make sale unto the above said kinge a\r\nyounge horse foale, aged one yeare, in full satisfacon for above said\r\nboy to enjoy for her pper use forever. In witness thereof, wee ye above\r\nspecified, have set our hands”.[1218]\r\n\r\nThe inventory of a North Carolina estate in 1693 valued a negro and his\r\nwife at £40, an Indian woman and her child at £15, and an Indian boy\r\nat £12.[1219] A bill of sale, March 5, 1711, shows an Indian between\r\ntwenty and thirty-five years of age sold for £14.[1220] In 1713, the\r\ncouncil of North Carolina decreed that “King Blount” might have eight\r\nIndians to ship to the West Indies at £10 per head.[1221] The average\r\nprice for the Indian captives taken in the Tuscarora War and sold as\r\nslaves to the islands and the northern colonies appears to have been\r\nabout £10 each.[1222]\r\n\r\nA South Carolina law of 1719 states that an Indian slave was of much\r\nless value than a negro.[1223] The English of South Carolina, according\r\nto the French, were accustomed to pay (1714) the Indians fifteen\r\npistoles for an Indian slave, while the French were able to purchase\r\nthem for 115 livres.[1224] The English sold these slaves ordinarily for\r\n300 or 400 livres.[1225]\r\n\r\nA comparison of these prices paid for Indian slaves shows much\r\nvariation at different times and places. In New England after the\r\nIndian wars the prices were low, for the chief object of the government\r\nwas to get rid of the captives. In localities where the Indian’s labor\r\nwas in greater demand the prices rose and appear to have been highest\r\namong the English of the southern colonies. When compared with sums\r\npaid for negroes at the same time and place, the prices of Indian\r\nslaves are found to have been considerably lower. In general the prices\r\nof slaves increased during the years preceding the Revolution, but the\r\nvalues of Indian slaves did not equal those of negro slaves.\r\n\r\nDuring the existence of Indian slavery, furthermore, there was never\r\nany general expression of opinion regarding it either in England[1226]\r\nor America, nor are there many records of opinions expressed during\r\nthe colonial period as to the right or wrong of enslaving the natives.\r\nThe English colonists followed the Spanish custom of reducing the\r\nIndians to a condition of slavery, but neither the English colonists\r\nnor the English government heeded the example of the later policy of\r\nthe Spanish government in looking upon Indian slavery as unjust and\r\ndeclaring it illegal.\r\n\r\nThat personal opinions favorable or unfavorable to the enslavement of\r\nIndians were not more generally expressed is not altogether strange.\r\nThe enslavement was not premeditated nor did it spring into sudden\r\nexistence throughout the English colonies, but began here and there in\r\nvarious colonies at various times and for various reasons. The custom\r\nof enslavement came from the necessity of disposing of war captives,\r\nfrom the greed of traders and from the demand for labor. Individuals\r\nin the colonies, such as officials of high rank and church leaders,\r\nwho would naturally be expected to express an opinion either for or\r\nagainst the custom, themselves held Indian slaves quite as a matter of\r\ncourse, and found no necessity for discussing their action. Nor did the\r\npossession and employment of Indian slaves ever become sufficiently\r\nextensive to present any of the problems which later attracted the\r\nattention of the people and led to the opposition which overthrew\r\nnegro slavery in several of the colonies, and incidentally, Indian\r\nslavery as well.\r\n\r\nYet throughout the history of Indian slavery certain expressions of\r\nopposition to the system, usually mild in nature, occurred from time\r\nto time. In the English colonies there was never any such earnest\r\nopponent to Indian slavery as the Spaniard, Las Casas, who argued\r\ndirectly against the enslavement of Indians from the standpoint of the\r\ninjustice of reducing the natives to such a condition. Most of the\r\nopposition expressed in the English colonies was aimed at some specific\r\ninstance of harsh treatment or cruel punishment of which enslavement\r\nwas an incident; or it arose during the later colonial period as a part\r\nof the antagonism to slavery in general; or, as was the case in South\r\nCarolina, it revealed the attitude of one faction of the government\r\ntoward the actions of another faction, and was not at all concerned in\r\nabolishing the practice of enslaving Indians as such.\r\n\r\nThe system adopted by Rhode Island at the time of King Philip’s War\r\nof using the captive Indians as involuntary indentured servants for\r\nshort periods of years, was anticipated by the query expressed by Roger\r\nWilliams in his letter to Governor Winthrop, September 18, 1637, as\r\nto whether the captive Indians whose lives were spared should not be\r\nretained in involuntary servitude for short periods of time and then\r\nbe released.[1227] This spirit of opposition to the enslavement of\r\nIndian captives for life, shown by Rhode Island during both the Pequot\r\nand King Philip wars, was somewhat out of harmony with the spirit of\r\nthe times. But it should be noted that this opposition was not the\r\nexpression of the entire colony. During the Pequot War it represented\r\nthe feeling of the “Liberal Party” against the enslavement of the\r\ncaptive Indians, and during King Philip’s War it resulted from the\r\ndominating influence of the Quaker element in the government.\r\n\r\nThe opposition of John Eliot to the enslavement of Indians during King\r\nPhilip’s War was similar to that shown by Roger Williams during the\r\nPequot War, though perhaps it was prompted by a more nearly unselfish\r\nand humanitarian motive. Throughout the war Eliot remonstrated strongly\r\nagainst selling the captive Indians into slavery. In a letter, June\r\n13, 1675, to the governor and council at Boston, he stated his reasons\r\nfor opposing the enslavement of the captives. He first urged a politic\r\nreason: that such enslavement was likely to prolong the war and bring\r\nstill further disaster upon the land by rousing the Indians to renewed\r\nhostilities. He then emphasized the Christian attitude of mercy by\r\nasserting that it is the design of Christ “not to extirpate nations but\r\nto Gospelize them”. “To sell souls for money,” he continued, “seems to\r\nme a dangerous merchandise. To sell them away from all means of grace,\r\nwhen Christ has provided means of grace for them, is the way for us\r\nto be active in the destroying of their souls.” His plea for mercy\r\nwas strengthened, also, by calling attention to the letters patent\r\nof the king which urged the Indians’ conversion rather than their\r\ndestruction.[1228]\r\n\r\nSome faint opposition to the enslavement of Indians was expressed by\r\nSamuel Sewall of Massachusetts in 1706, called forth by an act passed\r\nby Massachusetts against Indians and negroes. Perhaps something was\r\naccomplished by the protest, though the act either failed to pass or\r\nwas repealed, since no trace of it remains.[1229]\r\n\r\nIn 1729, Ralph Sandiford published a work entitled: “The Mystery of\r\nIniquity in a Brief Examination of the Practice of the Times.” In the\r\ndedication of his book, he speaks of going to South Carolina, and of\r\nrefusing the bounty of a rich colonist there because his riches had\r\nbeen obtained through the labor of negro and Indian slaves. He declares\r\nthat negroes and Indians who are the Lord’s freemen cannot be slaves to\r\nChristians.[1230] He further asserts that the matter he is aiming at is\r\n“this trading in mankind, which is pernicious to the Publick, but more\r\nespecially to the common-wealth of Israel; which raised forth a zeal\r\nin Men for the House of the Lord, which would have even consumed men\r\nhad not I witnessed against this rottenness and hypocrisy that would\r\nintroduce itself amongst the saints, whereby, as way-marks, they lead\r\nmany into the same corrupt practice which is contrary to the Principal\r\nof Truth, which is over the Heads of such Transgressors, that the\r\nRighteous in all Churches are undefiled with it, for their Bodies are\r\nthe Temples of the Holy Ghost to dwell in, which they cannot defile\r\nwith Babylon, who is Harloted from the Truth to feed upon the Flesh or\r\nreceive nourishment from the blood of the poor Negro or Indian captive,\r\nor whomsoever ravenous Nature (which is the Beast’s work) has power to\r\nprey upon”.[1231]\r\n\r\nGranville Sharp, in 1767, published in London a protest against\r\nslavery, in which he declared there could be no reasonable pretense\r\nfor holding either negroes or Indians in slavery. In discussing the\r\nbringing about of a state of slavery through contract he declared that\r\n“in such a case there would still remain a great suspicion that some\r\nundue advantage had been taken of the Indians’ ignorance concerning the\r\nnature of such a bond.” Slavery he declared a “shameless prostitution\r\nand infringement on the common and natural rights of mankind.” Every\r\ninhabitant of the king’s realm, regardless of color, he declared to be\r\nthe king’s subject, and asserted that no one, therefore, had a moral or\r\nlegal right to enslave any such subject.[1232] If color were a basis\r\nfor slavery, he argued, then in a short time any Englishman might be\r\nenslaved since there was but little difference between the complexion\r\nof a northern Indian and a white man.[1233]\r\n\r\nAnthony Benezet, about 1750, began to express his opposition to slavery\r\nin the almanacs and newspapers of the day. After three separate\r\npublications dealing with slavery in general, he issued in 1784 a book\r\nentitled “Some Observations on the Situation, Disposition and Character\r\nof the Indian Natives of this Continent.” In this he refers to the\r\nkindness, hospitality and generosity of the Indians toward the English\r\nin the early days of trade, and laments the fact that “the adventurers\r\nfrom a thirst of gain overreached the natives”, so that the latter “saw\r\nsome of their friends and relatives treacherously entrapped and carried\r\naway to be sold as slaves”.[1234]\r\n\r\nThroughout the colonial period the Society of Friends showed more or\r\nless opposition to slavery, although the members of the Society held\r\nslaves. From 1688 a certain amount of agitation concerning the matter\r\nis apparent in the records of the various quarterly and yearly meetings\r\nin Pennsylvania and the Jerseys. In the records of the Philadelphia\r\nYearly Meeting for the year 1719, is found the first mention of Indian\r\nslaves made in the minutes of the Yearly Meeting. In that year, after\r\nan earnest admonition to Friends to refrain from selling, trading or\r\nexchanging in any way any spirituous liquors with the Indians, the\r\nYearly Meeting voted: “And to avoid giving them occasion of discontent,\r\nit is desired, that Friends do not buy or sell Indian slaves.”[1235]\r\nFrom the wording of the record it may be concluded that the basis for\r\nthe Friends’ action was not the idea of any moral wrongdoing attached\r\nto the enslavement of Indians, but rather the possible harm that might\r\ncome to the colony through the discontent which enslavement might\r\ncause among the free Indians. And, judging from the previous action\r\nof the Society taken with regard to slavery, it may also be concluded\r\nthat this basis for the opposition to the trade in Indian slaves was\r\nused as a means of calling the immediate attention of its members to\r\nthe matter, and that the reason for the opposition of the Meeting to\r\ntrading in Indians was the same as that to negro slavery: “caution not\r\ncensure”.[1236]\r\n\r\nSome criticism was expressed in Massachusetts at the seizure of the\r\nIndians at Cocheco in 1676, and the subsequent transportation of\r\npart of the number captured by order of the government.[1237] Such\r\ncriticism, however, was not aimed at the action of the government in\r\nselling the Indians as slaves, but at the breach of faith in seizing\r\nIndians at peace.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, as already observed,[1238] the proprietors\r\nsanctioned enslavement of Indians when carried on for their own\r\nfinancial benefit, and opposed it when carried on by the colonial\r\nauthorities. The colonial officials favored the practice and carried\r\nit on both as a means of meeting colonial expenses and as a source of\r\npersonal income. In this respect the action of the existing colonial\r\ngovernment of South Carolina differs materially from that of the\r\nofficials of any other colony. Nowhere else was the desire for personal\r\ngain a controlling cause for the disposal of captives taken in war and\r\nhence colonial property.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to these incidental expressions of personal opposition to\r\nthe enslavement of Indians, stands the ownership and employment of them\r\nby leading colonists.[1239] The New Englanders not only bought Indians\r\nat the time of the Indian wars, but also sent requests to the colonial\r\nofficials for them. Captain Stoughton wrote to Governor Winthrop from\r\nthe scene of the Swamp Fight: “By this pinnace, you shall receive 48\r\nor 50 women and children, unless there stay any here to be helpful,\r\nconcerning which there is one, I formerly mentioned, that is the\r\n_fairest_ and _largest_ amongst them to whom I have given a coate to\r\ncloathe her. It is my desire to have her for a servant, if it may stand\r\nto your good liking, else not. There is a little squaw that steward\r\nCulacut desireth, to whom he hath given a coate. Lieut. Davenport also\r\ndesireth one, to wit, a small one, that has three strokes upon her\r\nstomach.... He desireth her, if it will stand with your good liking.\r\nSosomon, the Indian, desireth a young little squaw, which I know\r\nnot.”[1240] The Reverend Hugh Peter also wrote to Governor Winthrop in\r\n1637: “Mr. Endecot and my selfe salute you in the Lord Jesus, etc. Wee\r\nhaue heard of a diuidence of women and children in the bay and would\r\nbee glad of a share viz: a young woman or girle and a boy if you thinke\r\ngood: I wrote to you for some boyes for Bermudas, which I thinke is\r\nconsiderable.”[1241] In July, 1637, Roger Williams petitioned Governor\r\nWinthrop for an Indian as follows: “It having againe pleased the Most\r\nHigh to put into your hands another miserable droue of Adams degenerate\r\nseede, & our brethren by nature, I am bold (if I may not offend in\r\nit) to request the keeping & bringing vp of one of the children. I\r\nhaue fixed mine eye on this litle one with the red about his neck, but\r\nI will not be peremptory in my choice, but will rest in your loving\r\npleasure for him or any, &c.”[1242] The barrister, Emanuel Downing,\r\nwriting to John Winthrop in 1645, clearly illustrates the view of his\r\nday. He says: “A warr with the Narraganset is verie considerable to\r\nthis plantation, ffor I doubt whither yt be not synne in vs, hauing\r\npower in our hands, to suffer them to maynteyne the worship of the\r\ndevill which their paw wawes often doe; 2lie, If vpon a Just warre the\r\nLord should deliuer them into our hands, wee might easily haue men\r\nwoemen and children enough to exchange for Moores, which wilbe more\r\ngaynefull pilladge for vs then wee conceive, for I doe not see how wee\r\ncan thrive vntill wee gett into a stock of slaves sufficient to doe all\r\nour buisines, for our children’s children will hardly see this great\r\nContinent filled with people, soe that our servants will still desire\r\nfreedome to plant for them selues, and not stay but for verie great\r\nwages. And I suppose you know verie well how wee shall maynteyne 20\r\nMoores cheaper then one Englishe servant.”[1243]\r\n\r\nIn only a few of the English-American colonies were attempts made by\r\nlegislative enactment to end Indian slavery as a system separate from\r\nnegro slavery. The reasons for this fact are obvious. In the course of\r\ntime Indian slavery became absorbed by the institution of negro slavery\r\nto such an extent that it attracted no attention. With the various\r\ncolonial acts at the time of the Tuscarora War, which forbade the\r\nfurther importation of Indians into the northern colonies, the system\r\nwas maintained only by the natural increase of the Indian slaves\r\nalready in existence. So Indian slavery existed as an unimportant\r\nsystem along with and overshadowed by negro slavery until the spirit of\r\nopposition to the institution of slavery in general grew sufficiently\r\nstrong to lead to legislation providing for the abolition of slavery in\r\nvarious colonies.\r\n\r\nThe first colony to take such legislative action was Virginia, but in\r\nthis instance there is a slight possibility that the intent of the act\r\nto be discussed was quite different from what later interpretations\r\nhave considered it to be. In 1691, “by implication rather than by\r\nthe terms of the act”, Indian slavery was rendered illegal by an act\r\nauthorizing a free and open trade for all persons, at all times and\r\nall places, with all Indians whatsoever.[1244] It is barely possible\r\nthat the “legislature may have viewed the act as a treaty with a\r\nnation which, _ipso facto_, was recognized as of equal status as to\r\nfreedom, while the treaty in no wise prevented subsequent enslavement\r\nof individuals sold by the nation itself to the whites, or of hostile\r\ncaptives, or of Indians not native North Americans as generally\r\nunderstood”.[1245] But it is generally considered that the act was\r\nintended, as it was later construed, to acknowledge the free condition\r\nof all Indians. If the colonists of the time so construed it, they\r\nintentionally disobeyed it and enslavement of Indians continued. In\r\n1705, a similar act was passed with the same enacting clause.[1246]\r\nCases arising later showed a similar failure to accomplish desired\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nIn 1777, the assembly, when called to pass upon the matter, decided\r\nthat no Indians brought into Virginia since the passage of the act of\r\n1705, or their descendants, could be slaves in the commonwealth.[1247]\r\nAt that time knowledge of the existence of the act of 1691 seems to\r\nhave disappeared.[1248] Even after the decision of the assembly in\r\n1777, the settlement of the matter was so far uncertain as to give rise\r\nto certain cases in law in 1792 and 1793, appealed from the County\r\nCourt to the Court of Appeals to maintain the right to the services of\r\nthe descendants of Indians enslaved after the passing of the act of\r\n1705. In both these cases the higher court affirmed the decision of the\r\nlower courts which granted freedom to the Indians thus held as slaves,\r\nand which interpreted the act of 1705 as repealing all former acts\r\npermitting the existence of Indian slavery in the colony.[1249]\r\n\r\nIn 1806, the Supreme Court of the state decided that Indians had\r\nalways been considered free persons in fact and in right, and that the\r\npresumption was that all Indians introduced into the state at any time,\r\nwere _prima facie_ presumed to be free, or that, if the date of their\r\nintroduction did not appear, the _prima facie_ presumption was that\r\nthey were American Indians, or brought in after the act of 1705, and\r\ntherefore free.[1250] In 1808, came the judicial recognition of the\r\nlaw of 1691. A Supreme Court decision of that year declared “that no\r\nnative American Indian brought into Virginia since the year 1691 could\r\nunder any circumstances lawfully be made a slave.” It was also held\r\nby the court that if a female ancestor of a person asserting a right\r\nto freedom, whose genealogy could be traced back to such ancestor by\r\nfemales only, be proved to have been an Indian, “it seems incumbent on\r\nthose who claim such person as a slave to show that such ancestor, or\r\nsome female from which she descended, was brought into Virginia between\r\nthe years 1679 and 1691, and under circumstances which, according to\r\nthe laws then in force, created a right to hold her in slavery.”[1251]\r\n\r\nIn the case of Butt _v._ Rachel _et al._, 1814, the plaintiffs claimed\r\ntheir freedom as descendants of a native female Indian who was brought\r\ninto Virginia about the year 1747. The court instructed the jury that\r\nno native American Indian brought into Virginia since the year 1691,\r\ncould, under any circumstances, be made a slave. The defendant claimed\r\nto hold the slaves on the ground that they were the descendants of a\r\nnative American Indian woman who was held as a slave on the island of\r\nJamaica, and brought to Virginia as a slave about the year 1747. The\r\ndefendant moved the court to instruct the jury that a native American\r\nIndian held as a slave on the island of Jamaica by the laws of that\r\nisland, might be held as a slave when imported into Virginia. The court\r\nrefused so to do, and judgment was awarded the plaintiff. The case was\r\nappealed, but the court sustained the judgment.[1252]\r\n\r\nConsidering the possibility already mentioned that the act of 1691 may\r\nhave been intended to apply only to Indians outside the colony and\r\nthat it did not apply to those in the colony, either free or enslaved,\r\nand the fact that the later legislative action of 1777 and the cases\r\nin law already mentioned show that the law was either misconstrued or\r\nignored, the acts of 1691 and 1705, so far as putting an end to Indian\r\nslavery in Virginia in colonial times is concerned, might as well have\r\nnever existed.[1253]\r\n\r\nAt a later date, South Carolina also enacted laws which, by court\r\ndecision, were interpreted to mean the abolition of Indian slavery. The\r\nact of 1740[1254] stated that “all negroes, Indians (free Indians in\r\namity with this government, and negroes, mulattoes, or mestizoes who\r\nare now free, excepted), mulattoes, or mestizoes, who are now or who\r\nshall hereafter be in this province, and all their issue and offspring\r\nborn, or to be born, shall be, and they are hereby declared to be\r\nand remain forever hereafter, absolute slaves, and shall follow the\r\ncondition of the mother.” Under this provision it has been uniformly\r\nheld that color was _prima facie_ evidence that the party bearing the\r\ncolor of a negro, mulatto or mestizo, was a slave; but the same _prima\r\nfacie_ result did not follow from the Indian color, according to the\r\ndecision of the courts.[1255] After the passage of the act, Indians\r\nand descendants of Indians were regarded as free Indians in amity with\r\nthe government, until the contrary was shown. Elsewhere in the act of\r\n1740 it is declared that “every negro, Indian, mulatto, and mestizo\r\nis a slave unless the contrary can be made to appear”, yet in the\r\nsame act it is immediately thereafter provided—“the Indians in amity\r\nwith this government excepted, in which case the burden of the proof\r\nshall lie on the defendant”, that is on the person claiming the Indian\r\nplaintiff to be a slave. This latter clause of the provision grew to be\r\nconsidered the rule, and so the race of slave Indians, or of Indians\r\nnot in amity with the government, passed out of existence and the\r\nprevious part of the provision lost its application.[1256]\r\n\r\nBy an act of May 18, 1652, passed by the Commissioners of Providence\r\nPlantations and Warwick, it was provided that “no black mankind, or\r\nwhite, being forced to covenant, bond or otherwise, serve any man or\r\nhis assigns longer than ten years, or until they come to be twenty-four\r\nyears of age, if they be taken under fourteen, from the time of their\r\ncoming within the limits of this colony, and at the end or term\r\nof ten years to set them free, as the matter is with the English\r\nservants”.[1257] The act makes no mention of Indian slaves, doubtless\r\nbecause at this early date there were not enough in the colony to\r\narouse interest in their condition.\r\n\r\nWhen at the time of King Philip’s War Indian slaves were being\r\ntransported by Massachusetts and distributed among the settlements,\r\nRhode Island, March, 1676, passed a law concerning them similar to the\r\nlaw of 1652 relating to negroes. This act provided that “no Indian\r\nin this colony be a slave but only to pay their debts, or for their\r\nbringing up, or courtesy they have received, or to perform covenant, as\r\nif they had been countrymen not in war.”[1258]\r\n\r\nIn colonial New York it was customary to discriminate between the\r\nfree natives of the colony and those brought from the Spanish West\r\nIndies. On December 5, 1679, it was voted at a council meeting that\r\n“all Indians here are free and not slaves, except such as have been\r\nformerly brought from the Bay of Campeachy and other foreign parts”,\r\nsome of whom were slaves in the colony. Concerning such foreign Indians\r\nthe act provided: “But if any shall be brought hereafter within the\r\nspace of six months, they are to be disposed of as soon as may be, out\r\nof the government, but after the expiration of six months, all that\r\nshall be brought here from these parts shall be free”.[1259] On April\r\n20, 1680, a decree of governor and council repeated this resolution as\r\na formal order.[1260] Apparently no immediate attention was given to\r\nthe enforcement of the law. Later some action regarding the matter was\r\ntaken when the council, October 11, 1687, ordered that certain Spanish\r\nIndians brought from the Bay of Campeachy and sold as slaves in the\r\ncolony should be set free.[1261] On July 30, 1688, the council again\r\ntook up the question of foreign Indians. It was resolved “that all\r\nIndian slaves within this province subject to the King of Spain, that\r\ncan give an account of their Christian faith and say the Lord’s Prayer,\r\nbe forthwith set at liberty, and sent home by the first conveyance, and\r\nlikewise them that shall hereafter come to the province.”[1262] On the\r\nsame day the council rejected a petition of the owner to retain in the\r\ncolony an Indian slave purchased outside the colony and brought to New\r\nYork.[1263]\r\n\r\nThe numerous petitions to the governor to free such Indians from\r\nslavery, and his attitude in the matter, show the colonial authorities\r\nwilling to stand by their legislation on the subject. On December 28,\r\n1700, such a petition was presented by the mayor and aldermen of New\r\nYork City to the governor, demanding the release of a free born Indian\r\nwoman, a native of Curaçao, then held as a slave in New York.[1264] On\r\nJuly 15, 1703, Jacobus Kierstead, a mariner, of New York, petitioned\r\nthe governor regarding an Indian brought by him from the West Indies\r\nand sold as a slave.[1265] Soon after Governor Hunter’s arrival in the\r\nprovince a petition was handed him on behalf of a number of free-born\r\nSpanish subjects thus held as slaves.[1266] Among the victims was one\r\nStephen Domingo, a native of Carthagena, who had been held as a slave\r\nfor eight years. Hunter became interested in the matter and wrote to\r\nthe Board of Trade, June 23, 1712, that there were Spanish Indians in\r\nNew York who had been unjustly kept there in slavery for many years. He\r\ndiscovered that one Husea and one John, both held as slaves and both\r\nengaged in the slave conspiracy of 1712, were brought to New York as\r\nprisoners of war taken from a Spanish vessel by a privateer; that they\r\nwere Spanish-American Indians and subjects of the king of Spain, sold\r\nas slaves in New York and kept in bondage six or seven years “by reason\r\nof their color which is swarthy”. They declared they were sold among\r\nmany others of the same color and the same country. These two Indians\r\nGovernor Hunter reprieved awaiting the queen’s pleasure. The Indians\r\nwho petitioned, though he “secretly pitied their condition”, he was\r\nunable to help as he had no other evidence than their words.[1267]\r\n\r\nRhode Island is the only other colony which took direct action\r\nconcerning Spanish Indians, but even Rhode Island never put forth any\r\ngeneral legislation on the matter. Special action was taken similar to\r\nthat in New York. In 1746, the general assembly of Rhode Island and\r\nProvidence Plantations voted to send back to the West Indies certain\r\nfree subjects of the king of Spain who had been captured and sold in\r\nthe colony as slaves.[1268] These, like the others mentioned, were\r\ncaptives taken in the recent war with Spain.[1269] Here, as in New\r\nYork, the point involved was one of international importance, and the\r\nIndians concerned were considered, not as Indians but as the objects\r\nabout which the point was raised.\r\n\r\nThe other colonies of the original thirteen which finally took\r\nlegislative action to end the institution of slavery in general did not\r\naccomplish such action during the colonial period; so the conclusion\r\nremains that with the exception of Virginia, South Carolina, Rhode\r\nIsland and New York, none of the colonies ever declared Indian slavery\r\nillegal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n                      TITLES MENTIONED IN THE TEXT\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Printed Material_\r\n\r\nAdams, S.

In the south, the term “slave”\r\nwas used by the Indians, not only in the sense in which it is commonly\r\nused, but as applied to dogs, cats, tame and domestic animals, and to\r\ncaptive birds. “So when an Indian tells you that he has a slave for\r\nyou, it may, in general terms as they use, be a young eagle, a dog, or\r\nany other thing of that nature, which is obsequiously to depend upon\r\nthe master for its substance.” Lawson, _The History of North Carolina,\r\ncontaining the exact description and natural history of that country_,\r\np. 327.\r\n\r\n[15] In 1694, the Illinois informed Tonti that during the preceding\r\nseven years they had killed and taken prisoners 334 men and boys and\r\n111 women and girls.

It naturally died out first in the east, with the\r\ngrowth in power of the whites and the consequent decrease in the\r\nnumbers and strength of the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the Columbia River country held slaves till well into\r\nthe nineteenth century. These they procured by trading beads and\r\nfurs with the interior tribes. Franchère’s _Narrative_, in Thwaites,\r\n_Early Western Travels_, vi, p. 324; xxix, p. 242; xxx, p. 111. The\r\nBlackfeet, Cayuse, Crows, and Ute were accustomed to keep the women\r\ntaken in war as slaves, (_Ibid._, xxiii, p. 118); and other neighboring\r\ntribes did the same. Travelers in Oregon in 1846 found that the Oregon\r\nIndians enslaved their war captives, and that they made war for the\r\npurpose of obtaining slaves. _Ibid._, xxix, p. 124. The Toungletat,\r\nwho inhabited Vancouver Island, at the same time had Indian slaves,\r\ncaptives in war. _Ibid._, xxix, p. 149. The tribes of the section south\r\nof the Columbia River country were given over to the same custom.\r\nBoth here, and in the Columbia River country, the Indians were heavy\r\ngamblers, and not infrequently staked their own freedom in their games.\r\n_Ibid._, xxx, p. 161; xxvii, p. 171; Parker, _Journey Beyond the Rocky\r\nMountains_, p. 53. The Indians of the extreme northwest held slaves in\r\n1840. Considerable numbers were owned by the chiefs. These were worth\r\nthirty blankets each, and were generally purchased from the natives of\r\nQueen Charlotte Island, the great slave mart of the northwest coast.\r\nBancroft, _History of the Northwest Coast_, ii, pp. 647–649.\r\n\r\nThe slaves of the Columbia River country were well treated as long as\r\nthey were able to work. The district was a commercial one, and the\r\nslaves, as an article of commerce, were valuable. But when a slave grew\r\nold and was unable to work, he was neglected. The women of the tribe\r\nhad several slaves who were dependent entirely upon their will. Slaves\r\ncould be purchased by the male members of the tribes for wives. The\r\nOackinacke Indians, at this time, possessed but few slaves, and these\r\nwere adopted as children and as members of the family. _Ibid._, vii,\r\npp. 103, 107, 303.\r\n\r\nUntil 1850, the Thompson Indians of British Columbia enslaved captive\r\nIndians. Teit, _The Thompson Indians of British Columbia_, in _Memoirs\r\nof the American Museum of Natural History_, pp. 269, 290. In 1836, the\r\nChinook Indians possessed Indian slaves. In 1855, the Ute sacrificed\r\nfour slaves, and buried them with one of their chiefs. One of these\r\nslaves was buried alive. Thomas, _Indians of North America in Historic\r\nTimes_, p. 369. In 1863, the Cherokee abolished slavery by law. This\r\nwas amended in 1866, so as to permit it as a punishment for crime.\r\nThwaites, _Early Western Travels_, xx, p. 303.\r\n\r\n[110] Enslavement of the whites by the Indians was not uncommon. Cabeza\r\nde Vaca and other survivors of Narvaez’s expedition were made slaves by\r\nthe Indians among whom they wandered. _Narrative of Cabeza de Vaca_,\r\nin _Narratives of Early American History_, i, pp. 64, 69. Soto found\r\none of these survivors, Juan Ortiz by name, who had taken on Indian\r\ncustoms, and nearly forgotten his native language. “_Relation of\r\nBiedma_,” in Bourne, _Narratives of the Career of De Soto_, ii, p. 3.\r\n\r\nStrachey, _The Historie of Travaile into Virginia_, speaks of a story\r\nthat he had heard from the Indians, concerning an Indian chief, Eyanoco\r\nby name, living somewhere to the south of Virginia, who had seven white\r\nslaves who had escaped from the massacre at Roanoke. These slaves the\r\nIndians employed in beating copper. _Hakluyt Society Publication_,\r\nvi, p. 26. Whether the story is wholly or partly true has never been\r\ndetermined. That the Indians of the locality did enslave the whites\r\ncaptured in war or shipwrecked off the coast is shown by the preamble\r\nof an act of Carolina in 1707. _North Carolina Colonial Records_,\r\ni, p. 674. In the war of 1711, the Indians spared some of the women\r\nand children captured on the plantations so that they might serve as\r\nslaves. _Ibid._, i, p. 182.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hendrickson, in 1616, found three persons belonging to the\r\nDutch West India Company, who were slaves of the Mohawk and Minquae,\r\nand who were traded to him for merchandise. Hazard, _Annals of\r\nPennsylvania_, p. 7.\r\n\r\nFather Bressani was captured in 1644 by the Iroquois, and given to a\r\nwoman as a slave. She sent him to Fort Orange, where he was ransomed\r\nby the Dutch and returned to France. _Jesuit Relations_, xxvi, p.\r\n49. Other Jesuits were enslaved by the Iroquois. Basqueville de la\r\nPotherie, _Histoire de l’Amérique Septentrionale_, iv, pp. 125–163.\r\nFrench men, women and children had a similar fate. _Jesuit Relations_,\r\nxl, p. 137; xlvi, p. 207. Some of them were ransomed and freed by the\r\nDutch. Margry, _op. cit._, vi, pp. 123, 125. Joutel, in 1687, feared\r\nthat he would be enslaved by the Cenis, and put to work in their mines\r\nalong with their Indian slaves. Margry, _op. cit._, iii, p. 339. After\r\nthe death of La Salle, and the massacre of most of his followers in\r\n1687, the children who were spared were taken captive by the Spanish\r\nIndians, and sent to Mexico as slaves. Margry, _op. cit._, iii, p. 339.\r\nSaint Denis, in 1721, certified that he had been eleven months a slave\r\namong the savages of the west Mississippi country. Robinson, _Account\r\nof Discoveries in the West_, etc., p. 215. As late as 1754, the Indians\r\nof Virginia had French prisoners as slaves. _Virginia Historical\r\nSociety Collections_, iii, p. 267.\r\n\r\nIn the time of King Philip’s War, Mrs. Rowlandson of Lancaster was\r\ntaken prisoner by the Indians and sold to a Narraganset chief whose\r\nslave she became. Clark, _History of King Philip_, p. 290.

After telling the Indians of the\r\ncreation of the world, it traced the title thereto to St. Peter, and\r\nthence to the ruling pope. It cited also the grant of the Indies by\r\nthe pope to the sovereigns of Castile; and after urging the Indians to\r\nacknowledge their fealty to these sovereigns, it threatened them with\r\nwar and slavery if they refused.\r\n\r\n[119] Lowery, _op. cit._, p. 169.\r\n\r\n[120] _The Narrative of Cabeza de Vaca_, in _Original Narratives of\r\nEarly American History_, ii, p. 25.\r\n\r\n[121] _Ibid._, ii, p. 30.\r\n\r\n[122] Bourne, _op. cit._, i, p. 20.\r\n\r\n[123] Buckingham Smith, _Life of De Soto_, p. 170.\r\n\r\n[124] Bourne, _op. cit._, ii, pp. 60, 94, 97, 103, 105.\r\n\r\n[125] Bourne, _op. cit._, i, p. 34.\r\n\r\n[126] _Ibid._, i, p. 45; ii, pp. 25, 121.\r\n\r\n[127] _Ibid._, i, p. 70; ii, pp. 72, 75, 117, 129.\r\n\r\n[128] Coronado, in his letter to Mendoza, August 3, 1540, mentions\r\nboth negroes and Indians in the expedition.

The only instance in which a\r\nhome government demanded that Indians be sent to Europe to perform\r\nactual labor as slaves, exists in the case of the French. On July 31,\r\n1684, Louis XIV ordered de la Barre to send all Iroquois prisoners\r\nto France to serve in the galleys, because, said the letters royal,\r\n“these savages are strong and robust.” Brodhead, _History of New York_,\r\nfirst edition, ii, p. 476. De la Barre made an expedition against the\r\nIroquois, but was unsuccessful. In 1687, Denonville, the succeeding\r\ngovernor-general, led another expedition against the Iroquois who had\r\nbeen especially arrogant toward the French since the repulse of de la\r\nBarre. Before the expedition had set out from Fort Frontenac, another\r\ndispatch from the king had arrived. This repeated his former orders\r\nto send the Iroquois prisoners to France to serve in the galleys.\r\nDenonville obeyed the command. Brodhead, _op. cit._, ii, p. 507. The\r\norder was repeated March, 1688, declaring “It is certain that those\r\nIndians, who are vigorous and accustomed to hardship, can serve\r\nusefully on board his Majesty’s galleys,” Brodhead, _op. cit._, ii,\r\np. 546. Continued difficulties with the Indians led Denonville, among\r\nother concessions and attempts at conciliation, to write to France,\r\nasking that as many of the Indian galley slaves as survived should be\r\nreturned to Canada, and suggesting that, to produce as good an effect\r\nas possible, they be decently clothed. The request was complied with.\r\nMarshall, _Historical Writings relating to the early History of the\r\nWest_, p. 159; De Brumath, _Bishop Laval_, pp. 214, 215, 216.

On April 30th of that year, the Sieur Pierre Clermont appeared\r\nbefore the notary of the Cabildo and declared that he had had for a\r\nlong time in his service an Indian, Louison, of the nation of the\r\n“Sious.” The latter had served him with so much attachment and zeal\r\nthat he desired to reward him, and believed that the best way to do\r\nso was to give him his freedom. As, however, he had an indispensable\r\nneed for the Indian for three years longer, and feared that he might\r\nbe prevented by death from liberating him, he stated that it was his\r\nwish that in three years Louison be set free and enjoy all the rights\r\nof freedom. Louison, in his turn, stated that he thanked the Sieur\r\nClermont, and promised to serve him faithfully for three years. He\r\nalso agreed to lose all rights given him by his master if he should\r\nbe ungrateful to him.

The last public sale of a slave in\r\nCanada took place in Montreal in 1797. It has been held, however, that\r\nit was the proceeding of the Canadian courts, consistent with the\r\nrising public sentiment in England and France against slavery, rather\r\nthan the actual state of the law, which reached the slave owners’\r\nclaims, and finally broke them.

It was these mixed bloods, as\r\nwell as the pure blood Indians, to which the statutes referred by the\r\nterms “Indian slaves” and “mustee,” or “mestee,” slaves. Occasional\r\nmention is made in the colonial newspapers of slaves of the mixed\r\nred and black races. _American Weekly Mercury_, October 24, 1734.\r\nThe opinion has even been advanced that, in certain of the colonies,\r\nthere never were any pure blood Indian slaves. Mr. W. B. Melius of\r\nAlbany, New York, asserts; “I do not believe the pure Indian was sold\r\nas a slave (in New York), I believe the Indian who was the slave was\r\nnot without mixture.” _New York State Library Bulletin, History_, No.\r\n4, May, 1900. One instance of the mixture of the Indians and negroes\r\nin New York is found in a complaint made in 1717, that negro slaves\r\nran away, and were secreted by the Minisink with whose women they\r\nintermarried. _Ibid._, No. 4, May, 1900.\r\n\r\n[358] _Colonial Records of the State of Georgia_, vi, p. 259, mentions\r\nan Indian slave in 1749.\r\n\r\n[359] Howe, _Historical Collections of Virginia_, etc., p. 134.\r\n\r\n[360] Winthrop, _Journal History of New England_, i, p. 225, in\r\n_Original Narratives of Early American History_.\r\n\r\n[361] See Chapter V.\r\n\r\n[362] “It seems probable that there were no Indian slaves in Plymouth\r\nbefore the division of land in 1623.” _Massachusetts Historical Society\r\nCollections_, series 4, iii, p. 114.\r\n\r\n[363] _Boston News Letter_ and other newspapers.\r\n\r\n[364] Ellis, _The History of Roxbury Town_, p. 136.\r\n\r\n[365] Felt, _The History of Ipswich_, pp. 306, 320; _Boston Weekly\r\nMercury_, October 2, 1735.\r\n\r\n[366] Wilson, _Where American Independence Began_, p. 154.\r\n\r\n[367] Corey, _The History of Malden_, p. 416.\r\n\r\n[368] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[369] Chase, _The History of Haverhill_, pp. 239, 248.\r\n\r\n[370] Earle, _Customs and Fashions in Old New England_, p. 84.\r\n\r\n[371] Doyle, _English Colonies in America, The Puritan Colonies_,\r\nii, p. 68.

The same paper, July 25, 1743,\r\nadvertises another runaway Indian slave from New Castle, in the same\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\n[386] “In theory, at least, the Hollander considered the Indian a man\r\nlike himself, with analogous rights to life, liberty and possessions.”\r\nConsequently, “Indians were not enslaved in New Netherland.” Van\r\nRensselaer, _History of the City of New York in the Seventeenth\r\nCentury_, i, p. 63. These statements are rather difficult to prove.\r\nHolding Indians as slaves who had been enslaved elsewhere and then\r\nbrought into the colony, and making slaves in the colony and then\r\nsending them out of it, were practices that unquestionably existed,\r\neven if on a small scale. The declaration of the governor and council\r\nof New York in 1680 that “all Indians here have always been, and are,\r\nfree, and not slave, except such as have been formerly brought from the\r\nBay and Foreign Ports,” (Brodhead, _History of the State of New York_,\r\nfirst edition, ii, p. 331), shows the presence of some Indian slaves in\r\nthe Dutch colony.\r\n\r\nThe records of New Netherland contain accounts of manumission in that\r\ncolony of slaves called Spaniards and bearing Spanish names. Whether\r\nthese individuals were Spanish Indians, or negroes from the Spanish\r\nIslands, is not specified in the records. One such person received\r\nhis freedom in 1645, by payment of 300 carolus guilders. O’Callaghan,\r\n_Calendar of Historical Manuscripts in the Office of the Secretary of\r\nState, Albany, New York_, pt. i, p. 45. Another received his freedom in\r\n1646, in return for his long and faithful services. O’Callaghan, _op.\r\ncit._, pt. i, p. 105. Two others, slaves in the Company’s service, were\r\nfreed in 1664. O’Callaghan, _op. cit._, pt. i, p. 264. Still others,\r\nbelonging presumably to individual owners, received freedom in this\r\nsame year. O’Callaghan, _op. cit._, pt. i, p. 269.\r\n\r\nTwo incidents of enslavement of Indians in New Netherland are\r\nnoteworthy, even if the individuals concerned were subsequently\r\nsent out of the colony. The first instance occurred in 1644, in\r\nconnection with the Indian troubles of that time. At the close of the\r\ndifficulties, some of the Indian prisoners were sent by Governor Kieft\r\nto the Bermudas “as a present to the English governor.” Still others\r\nwere given to the “oldest and most experienced soldiers,” who, at that\r\ntime, were allowed to go to Holland. Brodhead, _History of the State of\r\nNew York_, revised edition, i, p. 396; _New York Colonial Documents_,\r\ni, p. 215; Van Rensselaer, _op. cit._, i, p. 235. The second instance\r\nwas connected with the Esopus Indians. On May 25, 1660, a resolution\r\nwas taken in the council to transport to Curaçao all but two or three\r\nof the lately acquired Esopus Indians, “to be employed there, or at\r\nBuenaire, with the negroes in the Company’s service.” Brodhead, _op.\r\ncit._, revised edition, i, p. 676; O’Callaghan, _Calendar of Historical\r\nManuscripts in the Office of the Secretary of State in Albany_, pt.\r\ni, p. 295. On June 29th, Stuyvesant issued an order, and arranged for\r\ntheir passage. O’Callaghan, _op. cit_., pt. i, p. 214. O’Callaghan,\r\n_History of New Netherland_, etc., ii, p. 420, gives the number\r\ntransported as eleven. Schoonmaker, _The History of Kingston_, p. 16,\r\nstates it as twenty. Those retained in the colony on this occasion were\r\nnot enslaved, but were to be punished “as might be thought proper or as\r\nnecessity might demand.” Schoonmaker, _op. cit._, p. 16. The relations\r\nwith the Iroquois had prevented any serious Indian wars in the colony,\r\nand because of this relation Stuyvesant’s act was considered highly\r\nimpolitic. His course, which was perhaps patterned after the action\r\nof the English following the Pequot War, he sought to justify in his\r\ndeclaration that “their enlargement would have a tendency to create\r\ndisaffection toward our nation. Our barbarian neighbors would glory,\r\nas if they had inspired us with terror.” Schoonmaker, _op. cit._, p.\r\n16. In 1661 these Indians were recalled from slavery.

Mason, _op.\r\ncit._, in Orr, _op. cit._, p. 39, gives the number of captives as one\r\nhundred and eighty.\r\n\r\nA division of the Indian captives among the allies would tend to draw\r\nthem nearer to the English. It was for this reason, and because the\r\nIndians enslaved at the first division of captives persisted in running\r\naway, that all the Indians of the second division were not enslaved.\r\nThe Indians distributed among the friendly Indians did not become\r\ntheir slaves. In the case of the Narraganset, Roger Williams informed\r\nGovernor Winthrop, June, 1637, that they did not desire to use the\r\nPequot as slaves, but preferred to treat them kindly, and grant them\r\nhouses and lands. _Massachusetts Historical Society Collections_,\r\nseries 4, vi, p. 195.\r\n\r\n[439] Winthrop, _Journal_, i, p. 225, in _Original Narratives of Early\r\nAmerican History_.\r\n\r\n[440] Steiner, _History of Slavery in Connecticut_, p. 9, in _Johns\r\nHopkins University Studies_, xi.\r\n\r\n[441] Morton, _op. cit._, 104; _Massachusetts Historical Society\r\nCollections_, series 4, iii, p. 360.

It is to be noted that none\r\nof the Indians transported were allowed to return to the colonies.\r\nThis same court, on rumors of Indians landing near the coast of Rhode\r\nIsland, forbade the landing of any Indian on the shores of Rhode Island\r\nor Narragansett Bay.

Yet the number\r\nkilled and sold, along with those who escaped, practically destroyed\r\nthe warring Indians. According to the Massachusetts Records of\r\n1676–1677 a day was set apart for public thanksgiving, because, among\r\nother things of moment, “there now scarce remains a name or family of\r\nthem (the Indians) but are either slain, captivated or fled.”\r\n\r\n[516] Both Plymouth and Massachusetts, by encouraging, as a part of\r\nthe war policy, the capture of Indians alive, through legalizing\r\nsuch capture or granting a specified reward for each captive,\r\nunintentionally increased the number of Indian captives that could be\r\nsold. In a declaration issued by the New England commissioners at the\r\nbeginning of the war, it was declared “lawful for any person, whether\r\nEnglish or Indian, that shall find any Indians traveling or skulking\r\nin any of the towns or roads (within specified limits), to command\r\nthem under their guard and examination, or to kill them as they may or\r\ncan.” To this direction was added: “The council hereby declaring, that\r\nit will be most acceptable to them that none be killed or wounded that\r\nare willing to surrender themselves into custody.” Halkett, _Historical\r\nNotes respecting the Indians of North America_, p. 135.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern campaign Massachusetts offered twenty shillings bounty\r\nfor every Indian scalp, and forty shillings for every prisoner. The\r\nindividual towns sometimes took similar action. For instance, the\r\npeople of Monhegan publicly offered a bounty of £5 for every Indian\r\nthat should be brought in. In 1694, Massachusetts decreed that\r\nvolunteers were to have for every Indian, great or small, which they\r\nshould kill or bring in prisoner, £50, as well as all plunder. Soldiers\r\nunder pay were to receive, over and above pay, £10. In 1695, £25 was\r\ndecreed as the reward for any Indian woman or young person under\r\nfourteen years of age. _Acts and Resolves_, i, pp. 176, 211, 292.\r\n\r\n[517] _Historical Magazine_, x, p. 188.\r\n\r\n[518] Douglas, _A Summary, Historical and Political_, etc., i, p. 557.\r\n\r\n[519] _Acts and Resolves_, viii, p. 45.\r\n\r\n[520] _Ibid._, i, 530.\r\n\r\n[521] Church, _op. cit._, Dexter edition, i, p. 189.

The feeling\r\nagainst the Praying Indians was so strong that a council in Boston,\r\nAugust 30, 1675, disbanded them, and distributed them among five of\r\ntheir own villages.

Some of them were transported before harvests were\r\ngathered, and the government neglected to provide them with sufficient\r\nfood, clothes and shelter. _Ibid._, ii, 1836, p. 433 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[524] Belknap, _The History of New Hampshire_, i, p. 245.\r\n\r\n[525] Sumner, _A History of East Boston_, etc., p. 197.\r\n\r\n[526] Gookin, _op. cit._, in _American Antiquarian Society\r\nCollections_, 1836, ii, p. 449.\r\n\r\n[527] Some of the Praying Indians fought on the English side. It was\r\nreported among the Indians that these Christian Indians never shot\r\nat their Indian opponents, but into the tops of trees, and that they\r\nsold to Phipp’s agents the ammunition provided them. _Massachusetts\r\nHistorical Society Collections_, series 5, i, p. 106.\r\n\r\n[528] It is estimated that there were probably between 30,000 and\r\n40,000 white inhabitants in the United Colonies at the time of King\r\nPhilip’s War, and that of these, 6,000 to 8,000 were able to bear arms.\r\nMather, _A Brief History of the War with the Indians of New England_,\r\np. xxix. No estimate of the number of Praying Indians at the time\r\nof the war seems available. Palfrey, _A Compendious History of New\r\nEngland from the Discovery by Europeans_, etc., ii, p. 124, states\r\ntheir number, when at the highest, as 4,000. In 1685, Mr. Hinckley,\r\ngovernor of Plymouth, estimated them at 1,439, not counting children\r\nunder twelve years of age. Hutchinson, _The History of the Colony of\r\nMassachusetts_, i, p. 349.\r\n\r\n[529] _Plymouth Colony Records_, v, pp. 173–174; xii, p. 242; Baylies,\r\n_op. cit._, ii, pt. iii, p. 188.\r\n\r\n[530] Church, _op. cit._, Dexter edition, i, p. 182, mentions the sale\r\nof an old Indian named “Conscience” to a native of Swanzey. Perhaps an\r\nexception was made in the case of this Indian, because of age. Another\r\nexception appears to have been made by the Plymouth Court, September\r\n1, 1676, when Sergeant Rogers was allowed to keep his Indian man at\r\nhis own house, provided he should produce the said Indian on demand of\r\nthe court. Hough, _op. cit._, p. 186. Still another exception was made\r\nby the Plymouth Court at the same session granting Church the right to\r\n“some five or six Indians,” who, if their behavior was satisfactory,\r\nmight remain in the colony and not be sold to foreign parts unless\r\nany of them should be proved to have murdered any of the English.\r\nOne Indian named “Crossman” was especially mentioned, as he had been\r\naccused of murdering Mr. Hezekiah Willet. _Plymouth Colony Records_,\r\nxi, p. 242; Baylies, _op. cit._, ii, pt. iii, p. 188.\r\n\r\n[531] Pamphlet published in Cambridge in 1677, now in possession of the\r\nBoston Athenaeum. The full text is as follows:\r\n\r\n“At a court held at Boston in New England, the 29th of March, 1677. The\r\ncouncil being informed that certain strange Indians, who have been in\r\nHostility against us, or have lived amongst such, are brought into this\r\nJurisdiction, and bought by several persons, which causeth much trouble\r\nand fear to the Inhabitants where they reside, and may be of dangerous\r\nconsequence, not only to the Towns where they live, but to the whole\r\nJurisdiction, if not timely prevented:\r\n\r\n“It is therefore Ordered that what person soever within this\r\nJurisdiction shall hereafter buy or keep above ten days after the\r\npublication hereof, any such Indian, man or woman already bought,\r\nabove the age of twelve years, without allowance from authority, shall\r\nbesides the forfeit of such Indian or Indians, pay the fine of five\r\npounds to the Treasurer of the Country, and the Constables of the\r\nseveral towns are ordered forthwith to publish this Order in their\r\nPrecincts.\r\n\r\nBy the Council, Edward Rawson, Secr.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[532] _Plymouth Colony Records_, v, p. 253.\r\n\r\n[533] _Ibid._, ix, p. 71.\r\n\r\n[534] Sylvester, _op. cit._, ii, p. 259; _Plymouth Colony Records_, v,\r\np. 173.

In at least one instance, provision\r\nagainst their being sold as slaves was made by the Indians in the\r\nterms of their surrender. When the squaw-sachem, Awanthonks, deserted\r\nthe cause of Philip and allied herself with the English, she obtained\r\na promise from the Plymouth government “that the life of every man,\r\nwoman and child shall be spared, and none shall ever be sold as slaves,\r\nor transported from their native soil.” Hough, _op. cit._, p. 20;\r\nDrake, _The Book of the Indians_, ninth edition, p. 252; Freeman,\r\n_Civilization and Barbarism_, p. 129.\r\n\r\n[538] Shurtleff, _op. cit._, v, p. 136; _Plymouth Colony Records_, v,\r\npp. 207, 223.\r\n\r\n[539] _Connecticut Colonial Records_, ii, 1665–1677, pp. 297–298.\r\nIndians convicted of having murdered any of the English were to be put\r\nto death, as in Massachusetts and Plymouth.\r\n\r\n[540] _Connecticut Colonial Records_, ii, 1665–1677, pp. 481–482.

Rhode Island\r\nwas accustomed to sell both whites and Indians into temporary servitude\r\nas punishment for crime. The Indians here mentioned were probably\r\nexamples of such cases. See _Rhode Island Tracts_, No. 18, p. 131. The\r\ntowns appears to have reversed its policy later. See Weeden, _Early\r\nRhode Island_, etc., p. 178.\r\n\r\nIt was politic for the colonial governments to oppose the enslavement\r\nof Indians who were friendly to the English or in alliance with them.\r\nTwo such instances are recorded in connection with North Carolina. In\r\n1713, at the request of the governor of New York, the Seneca Indians\r\nsent an Indian to the Tuscarora to caution them against going to war\r\nwith the English. The South Carolina Indians captured this Indian and\r\nheld him as a slave. The council decided to buy him and send him back\r\nto his own nation. _North Carolina Colonial Records_, ii, pp. 1–2.\r\nIn the same year the council ordered that a colonist who had sold a\r\nfriendly Indian as a slave should be held for trial. _Ibid._, ii, p. 55.\r\n\r\nDuring the intercolonial wars the French Indians were accustomed to\r\ntake both their white and red captives to Canada, where the latter\r\nbecame slaves. As a part of their protective, diplomatic and military\r\npolicy, the English sought to regain the freedom of these Indians, and\r\nthus retain the friendship of the Six Nations. In 1688, Governor Dongan\r\ndemanded of the French agents that certain New York Indians who had\r\nbeen sent from Canada to France, be returned to the English consul at\r\nParis or to the authorities in London, so that they might be brought\r\nhome and be given their freedom. _New York Colonial Documents_, iii,\r\np. 526. The French authorities agreed, and the Indians were brought\r\nback. _Ibid._, iii, pp. 621, 732, 733. In 1748, Governor Shirley sought\r\nto obtain the freedom of a Rhode Island Indian who had been sold as a\r\nslave in Canada, and on another occasion sent fourteen French prisoners\r\nto South Carolina to redeem certain members of the Six Nations who\r\nwere held there. _Ibid._, vi, p. 448. Throughout the French and Indian\r\nstruggle the governors of New York insisted that the members of the\r\nSix Nations, when captured in war, should be treated exactly as other\r\nEnglish subjects, or, in other words, that they should not be enslaved.\r\n\r\n[547] _Hakluyt Society Publications_, vii, p. 23; Beazley, _John and\r\nSebastian Cabot_, p. 118.\r\n\r\n[548] Beazley, _op. cit._, p. 118.\r\n\r\n[549] Historians differ regarding the place where these Indians were\r\ncaptured. J. G. Kohl, in _A History of the Discovery of the East Coast\r\nof North America_, reprinted in _Maine Historical Society Collections_,\r\nseries 2, i, p. 142, expresses the opinion that Cabot probably obtained\r\nthem on some shore south of New York harbor. James S. Buckingham, in\r\n_Canada, Nova Scotia_, etc., pp. 168, 337; and Samuel G.

A\r\nSpanish fleet captured the ship, and the Indians were carried to Spain.\r\nGorges afterward recovered one of these two, who, with at least two\r\nothers of the original five, was afterward sent to America.

In 1685, the master of a Carolina brig, in a\r\npetition to Governor Dongan of New York, complained of Humphrey Ashley,\r\nwho chartered the vessel but ruined the voyage by killing an Indian and\r\nkidnapping four others near the Cape Fear River, whom he brought to the\r\nport of New York. The result shows the colonial government of New York\r\nnot in favor of kidnapping. The necessity of keeping on good relations\r\nwith the Iroquois made it policy to discourage the kidnapping custom.\r\nSo it was ordered that all the effects of Ashley be sold at auction and\r\nthe proceeds used to defray the cost of transporting Ashley and the\r\nfour Indians back to Carolina.

The government\r\nofficials claimed that the Indian outbreaks against the English were\r\ncaused, not by any action of the officials in stirring them up to\r\nobtain slaves, but rather by the abuses practiced upon them by the\r\ntraders and by the inability of the colonial government to control the\r\ntraders. _Journal of the Board of Trade, Public Record Office_, Co.\r\n391, 25 R., xvii, pp. 168, 169, 176, 191.\r\n\r\n[621] Chalmers, _op. cit._, in Carroll, _op. cit._, ii, p. 314. This\r\nspecial letter of the proprietors was called forth by Captain Godfrey’s\r\ntreatment of the Indians, and by the opinions of private individuals\r\nexpressed in letters to them. The proprietors had already struck a blow\r\nat the council by giving the parliament a right to punish members of\r\nthe council for misbehavior.

Not until 1772 did the highest\r\nEnglish court declare the common law of England incompatible with\r\nslavery, and neither recognizing nor permitting its existence in\r\nEngland. The decision had no relation to the colonies.\r\n\r\n[744] Wheeler, _op. cit._, p. 15. Had there been any objection raised\r\nby the mother country to the enslavement of Indians on the ground of\r\nillegality, the colonists could have fallen back on the recognized\r\nright of enslaving captives in war. By a legal fiction the Indians\r\ncould at any time have been considered in a state of war, their lands\r\nconfiscated and their persons seized and held for disposal at the\r\npleasure of the whites. Such was the legal argument used by England in\r\njustification of enslaving the African negroes.\r\n\r\n[745] For a discussion of the neglect to define the Indians’ rights in\r\nthe various letters patent and charters, see the _Eighteenth Annual\r\nReport of the Bureau of American Ethnology_, pt. ii, p. 550.\r\n\r\n[746] _Massachusetts Historical Society Collections_, series 3, i, p.\r\n27, contains a bill of sale of an Indian man, given by Governor John\r\nWinthrop of Massachusetts to John Mainford of Barbadoes.\r\n\r\n[747] As typical examples of this kind of advertisement, see _Boston\r\nGazette_, December 15, 1718; _Pennsylvania Gazette_, March 7, 1732;\r\n_New England Weekly Journal_, March 5, 1733; _Boston News Letter_,\r\nAugust 20, 1711; January 5, 1719; December 28, 1720.\r\n\r\n[748] _Boston News Letter_, July 2, 1711; October 11, 1708; October\r\n6, 1737; February 11, 1717; November 22, 1708; May 24, 1714; _Boston\r\nGazette or Weekly Journal_, November 15, 1748; _New England Weekly\r\nJournal_, February 24, 1729.\r\n\r\n[749] Stiles, _A History of the City of Brooklyn_, etc., i, p. 233;\r\n_New York Mercury_, June 12, 1758.\r\n\r\n[750] _Early Records of Portsmouth_, p. 434; Currier, _History of\r\nNewbury_, p. 254.\r\n\r\n[751] Winthrop, _Life and Letters of John Winthrop_, ii, p. 252;\r\nWinsor, _The Memorial History of Boston_, i, p. 489.\r\n\r\n[752] See _South Carolina Historical and Genealogical Magazine_, vii,\r\np. 169, (1691); x, p. 85, (1694); v, p. 98, (1710); v, p. 164, (1730);\r\nvi, p. 173, (1732); v, p. 105, (1734); vi, p. 117, (1735); v, p. 218,\r\n(1753); v, p. 113, (1765); viii, p. 214, (1769); vi, p. 25, (1802).\r\n\r\n[753] _Charleston Year Book_, 1900, p. 42 (appendix), cites a will in\r\nNew London, Connecticut (1711) disposing of Indian slaves.

The testimony of the Reverend Hugh Jones,\r\nchaplain of the Virginia assembly, shows that the colonists, even\r\nafter such legislative action, did not approve of the baptizing of\r\nIndians and negroes as they thought it made them proud and not so\r\ngood servants. Jones, however, declared that these objections could\r\nbe easily refuted “if the persons be sensible, good and understand\r\nEnglish, and have been taught (or are willing to learn) the principles\r\nof Christianity and if they be kept to the observance of it afterward,\r\nfor Christianizing encourages and orders them to become more humble and\r\nbetter servants and not worse than when they were heathen.” Jones, _The\r\nPresent State of Virginia_, in Sabin’s _Reprints_, No. 5, p. 70.\r\n\r\n[1038] Trott, _Laws of the British Plantations in America_, etc., p.\r\n142.\r\n\r\n[1039] The parish register of St. Peters, New Kent County, Virginia,\r\n1680–1787. pp. 53 and 64, mentions the deaths of two Indian slaves in\r\n1722 and 1723, but records no births or marriages.\r\n\r\n[1040] _Archives of Maryland_, xiii, p. 505.\r\n\r\n[1041] _Ibid._, xix, p. 32.\r\n\r\n[1042] Bacon, _Laws of Maryland_.\r\n\r\n[1043] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[1044] Trott, _op. cit._, p. 257.\r\n\r\n[1045] Morgan, _Slavery in New York_, in _Historic New York_, i, p. 8.\r\n\r\n[1046] _New York Colonial Documents_, iii, p. 415.\r\n\r\n[1047] Brodhead, _op. cit._, first edition, ii, p. 486.

The public criticism of the play and\r\nopera “Incle and Yarico,” which dealt with the capture of two Indian\r\ngirls in America and their subsequent sale in Barbadoes, because the\r\nfirst scene was laid in America, tends to show a general ignorance\r\non the subject. This play written by Coleman and told in story by\r\nSteele in “The Spectator,” No. 11, March 13, 1710, is supposed to have\r\nbeen founded on fact. The event is described in Ligon, _History of\r\nBarbadoes_, p. 55. The play is given in Inchbald, _British Theatre_.\r\n\r\n[1227] _Massachusetts Historical Society Collections_, series 4, vi, p.\r\n214.\r\n\r\n[1228] _Massachusetts Manuscript Records_, xxx, No. 173; _Plymouth\r\nColony Records_, x, pp. 451–453; _New England Historical and\r\nGenealogical Register_, vi, p. 297 and xxxii, p. 299; Winsor, _The\r\nMemorial History of Boston_, i, p. 322.\r\n\r\n[1229] Moore, _Notes on the History of Slavery in Massachusetts_, p.\r\n90.

According to custom the action of the Yearly Meeting\r\nwas at once made known to the various Quarterly Meetings within its\r\njurisdiction by extracts from its minutes. Such extracts recorded\r\nin the minutes of the various Quarterly Meetings for the year 1719\r\ncontain exactly the same expression: “And to avoid giving them occasion\r\nof discontent, it is desired that Friends do not buy or sell Indian\r\nslaves.”\r\n\r\n[1236] After 1719 the records show the opposition of the Yearly Meeting\r\nto have been expressed against slavery in general, and no mention is\r\nmade of Indian slaves, though the records sometimes read: “negroes and\r\nother slaves.” For the action of the Yearly Meeting at various times\r\nup to the time of the abolition of slavery in Pennsylvania in 1780,\r\nsee _Pennsylvania Historical Society Memoirs_, i, p. 392 _et seq._;\r\nSharpless, _A History of Quaker Government in Pennsylvania_, ii, p. 224\r\n_et seq._; _American Society of Church Publications_, v. ii, (article\r\nby Allen C.
